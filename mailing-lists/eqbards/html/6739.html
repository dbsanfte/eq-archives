 </span></blockquote>Well Master is 101, so 100 would do what you want. However, the skill<br/>
ratings system is incredibly out of balance, as skills can max at<br/>
200-250 for combat/magic skills, yet there is absolutely no change in<br/>
rating after Master at 101. I think they originally intended 100 to be<br/>
the max and then redesigned the numeric skills but didn&#39;t get around to<br/>
adjusting the ratings. At least that&#39;s the only explanation that makes<br/>
any sense to me. Under the current rating system, Master level should<br/>
really be Average, IMO, as you are really only half way to true mastery<br/>
of your skills. It&#39;s going to go even more out of whack with the<br/>
expansion when people can level to 75.<br/>
<br/>
Just another one of those things they could be working on if they<br/>
weren&#39;t so busy re-editing item tables and other critical things I<br/>
guess.<br/>
