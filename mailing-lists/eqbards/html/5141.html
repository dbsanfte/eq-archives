<div id="ygrps-yiv-378700752"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There is no wandering.  Everyone stays put.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Speak for yourself. Within my first 7 levels, I had been to all three<br/>
continents and more zones than I can remember. I&#39;d much rather be<br/>
exploring Norrath than camping some mob for some spiffy item.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Camping is a problem, everyone says, and we<br/>
&gt; have all these solutions suggested and<br/>
&gt; implemented.  But, mmmm, none will work!<br/>
&gt; Camping is central to EverQuest!  Everyone<br/>
&gt; camps!  Everywhere!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have to agree with you there. The problem in my opinion is that the<br/>
same mobs spawn in the same spots with the same items. This is a<br/>
mistake, but one that probably won&#39;t ever be fixed. However, the new<br/>
change to no-drop type items is about the best thing that Verant could<br/>
have done to combat the problem. Why camp for that great armor off of<br/>
someone in the Fear plane if you&#39;ve already got it? You can&#39;t carry it<br/>
anyway. I&#39;d almost like to see all armor and weapons dropped by mobs to<br/>
be no-drop items (that could be sold to merchants only). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; permafrost together, eventually reaching some<br/>
&gt; deep section, then heading back to quit for<br/>
&gt; the evening.  This is an ideal, I wish I could<br/>
&gt; be in THAT group, because I have NEVER ever<br/>
&gt; ever ever been in a group like that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pretty much how I play. I refuse to sit and camp some particular<br/>
spot for any amount of time. Go in, clear it out, be happy and leave.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Either your group can Handle the best<br/>
&gt; of a dungeon, in which case they get<br/>
&gt; no experience as they battle their way<br/>
&gt; through it to the end, or they<br/>
&gt; camp the area where they get it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my opinion (your thoughts may vary), people worry *WAY* too much<br/>
about getting experience and advancing in levels. These people have too<br/>
much of a hack & slash mentality. I don&#39;t worry about gaining levels as<br/>
much as I do about seeing new things. At level 17 I had a great time<br/>
going through Infected Paw where everything was green to me. Did I gain<br/>
k00l d00d kr@d experience? Nope. Did I have a great time? Yup. And<br/>
guess what, I didn&#39;t spend all my time healing. I got to look around<br/>
and actually see the place. Quit worrying about reaching level 50 and<br/>
getting the bestest items in Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A while back I was O so bored &quot;camping the wall&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So why were you doing it? You&#39;re bored with something that you don&#39;t<br/>
have to be doing. Move on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I had a friend in traction 10 months for<br/>
&gt; an accident.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;m sure if you died in real life, you wouldn&#39;t respawn in your<br/>
bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My solution:  No natural regeration of<br/>
&gt; wounds, for anyone.  This is not how<br/>
&gt; wounds work, afterall.  A warrior is<br/>
&gt; wounded, make no natural regeneration<br/>
&gt; but increase effect of bandages.  They<br/>
&gt; want healing, find a freaking cleric.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then people complain, like you did above, about how much down time<br/>
there is even more. No thanks. People in real life (tm) do natually<br/>
regenerate - there&#39;s no reason to not do so in the game.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; gravity, and follows Einstein<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who says Einstein was correct?   :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; created out of thin air.  It needs<br/>
&gt; a source<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Magic/mana as played in D&D is given by the player&#39;s diety, or could be<br/>
thought of as stamina, but for casters. You can run & jump all you want<br/>
until you&#39;re out of stamina, but when you get worn out you have to rest<br/>
to get your stamina back. Mana is like that for casters. They can cast<br/>
all they want, but they eventually get worn out and get a headache.<br/>
They rest a bit and can cast spells again. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want the game to require people to be<br/>
&gt; on THE MOVE and not encourage them to sit<br/>
&gt; around like they&#39;re lazy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only way this is going to happen is to make mobs respawn<br/>
dynamically. Meaning, in different spots. It&#39;s bad planning to have<br/>
static spawn points (even for players). It&#39;s even worse to make it so<br/>
that the *same* mobs have the *same* loot all the time (or on a<br/>
rotation)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I fight this AI, it makes me bored.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No offense, but if you can do better - I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all be happy to<br/>
buy the game you do it in. You want &quot;intelligent&quot; AI? Buy Quake. Buy<br/>
Unreal. (Which was supposed to have great AI) Monster sees player.<br/>
Monster runs to player to try to kill. Monster dies or player dies. End<br/>
of encounter. EQ&#39;s mobs not only know when to run, they know to attack<br/>
the player doing the most damage to them, they also know to keep<br/>
attacking the player with the lowest health, and a few other things.<br/>
Sure, it&#39;s not perfect. But the game as a whole, is very good.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tradeskills are lacking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No argument here. There&#39;s pretty much no reason to do any of them<br/>
unless you&#39;ve got a lot of money to start Jewelry or Blacksmithing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is like a moment locked in time,<br/>
&gt; it never changes.  No matter what<br/>
&gt; anyone does, the NPCs will always<br/>
&gt; be locked in that moment, regardless<br/>
&gt; what level the real folk have gotten<br/>
&gt; to.  The &quot;plot&quot; is unchanging.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With 1500 people on a server all going through the same process,<br/>
unfortunately (or fortunately) these things must be that way, otherwise<br/>
nobody would EVER know what to do. Suppose all the lower level things<br/>
were already accomplished. Any new players coming into a new war<br/>
between Freeport and Neriak would be slaughtered. And how would you<br/>
document such things so that when players came into the world, they<br/>
could find out everything that came to be before them? A few years<br/>
after the game started, the amount of collected information would be<br/>
untrackable by new players.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; online rolplaying game with an ongoing plot!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try to fathom the amount of programming and staff that this would<br/>
require. I can assure you that you wouldn&#39;t get such a game for $10 a<br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The story sucks, folks.  It wants to<br/>
&gt; be a single player game, the story!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you hate it so much, feel free to stop playing. Personally, my wife<br/>
and I like the story and background given quite a lot. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To really encourage roleplaying and a<br/>
&gt; community allow people access to an<br/>
&gt; in-game print press.  Where they can<br/>
&gt; make their own newspapers or books.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting idea for a trade skill. But it would be abused. Imagine<br/>
&quot;Women of Norrath - Issue #69&quot; by some krad k00l d00d clan.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In Everquest, there&#39;s no option but<br/>
&gt; combat, everything else sucks<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In YOUR opinion. Personally, I find a great many things in Norrath to<br/>
enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if you don&#39;t like the way combat<br/>
&gt; works, well then you&#39;re fucked.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really.<br/>
<br/>
1. Cancel account<br/>
2. C:&#92;&gt; del &#92;everquest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You get from the game what you want to get from it. You paid for it,<br/>
you have a right to complain about it and I&#39;m not one to argue your<br/>
complaints (I cant do jack about them). But I will say that for the<br/>
most part, I disagree with nearly everything you said. (For whatever<br/>
that matters) The game plays as you play. If you play a hack & slash,<br/>
you&#39;re going to get very bored, very quickly. If you put yourself into<br/>
the world and find players that do the same, then it can be quite a lot<br/>
of fun. You dont like camping? DONT FRIGGIN CAMP. Norrath is a large<br/>
world and there&#39;s a lot to see. Personally, I plan to start mapping. I<br/>
may not get experience, but I&#39;m sure to have fun actually seeing<br/>
everything - perhaps even some stuff that isn&#39;t currently mapped or<br/>
known about.<br/>
<br/>
PS: If you want to see something that&#39;ll make you happier about<br/>
EverQuest, try to check out someone playing the beta of Asheron&#39;s Call.<br/>
I&#39;m beta testing it and it&#39;s no competition to EQ in any way.<br/>
