<b>Subject:</b> Re: NPC&#39;s Binding <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-710351685">I am curious then, what is the rationale behind allowing casters to bind<br/>
right outside of a dungeon.  My beef has never been that only casters can<br/>
bind.  Heck, I party up 100% of the time, and always with someone who can<br/>
bind.  I have no problem with this.  But what ungodly reason made you guys<br/>
decide to make 2/3rds of the classes have to run for long periods of time,<br/>
sometimes VERY long periods of time to get back to the dungeon they were<br/>
in, while the binding classes are back in a matter of minutes.  One of the<br/>
most discouraging problems in EQ is DOWNTIME.  I would rather die several<br/>
times in a row trying to get my corpse than have to run for 30 minutes<br/>
before even getting to TRY.  Now granted, the one nice benefit of this is<br/>
that it makes adventuring in far away dungeons more difficult, and<br/>
therefore less people populate these dungeons than otherwise would, but it<br/>
is still unbalancing to the game.  I&#39;m with the folks that say NO ONE<br/>
should be able to bind outside cities.  Nothing more frustrating than<br/>
getting killed in Paw, and have to run all the way back from Highhold,<br/>
while your cleric and wizard buddies are back in the dungeon, with all<br/>
their stuff, making experience and cash while you&#39;re just running naked,<br/>
trying not to get killed by Griffons and Hill Giants.  This isn&#39;t even<br/>
bringing up the bard specific problem that it takes forever to remem all<br/>
your songs since we don&#39;t have meditate.  So the casters get a huge bonus<br/>
there as well.  They die, and 30 seconds later they&#39;re back up and ready to<br/>
go, with basically no loss in offensive power, but some loss in defense.  I<br/>
hate to suggest gimping another class, but in this case, I see it as the<br/>
only way to address a serious game inbalance.  The ONLY thing that keeps me<br/>
playing a bard at all is that I do get accelerando.  I would never play a<br/>
non-caster, non-bard though, due to the incredible frustration of running<br/>
back to your corpse.  Some would say, &quot;Just don&#39;t die.&quot;  To which I say,<br/>
&quot;If I&#39;m not dying, I&#39;m not taking enough risks for the game to be fun.&quot;<br/>
The running back part is far from fun however.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, rambling.  :)<br/>

&gt;It was decided early on that all casting classes (not hybrids) would have<br/>
&gt;Gate, and only a couple classes would have Bind Affinity.  As a matter of<br/>
&gt;fact, some of you early phase testers might recall that Bind used to require<br/>
&gt;a then hard to find and costly stone to cast.<br/>
