<div id="ygrps-yiv-285502669">We cleared Pegasus Island yesterday, somehow getting the Keeper of Sky to<br/>
spawn twice.  Casualties were approximately 8 to 10 of our 30 person<br/>
force per Pegasus/Griffon, and about 6 per Keeper of Sky.  Today we&#39;ll get<br/>
the KoS to spawn one more time, get 36 people keys, and combat drop into<br/>
Spiroc Island.  Hopefully we&#39;ll have that and Bzzzat island cleared today.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to completing some of the higher tier quests in pos.<br/>
Maybe the bard and cleric items won&#39;t be as crappy as the ranger ones.<br/>
