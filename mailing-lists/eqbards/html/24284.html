<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448726897">A few reasons why Tanks are not responsive;<br/>
<br/>
My mains a tank and the amount of crap that comes up the screen at this level<br/>
JUST from my hits scrolls lots of stuff off really fast.  Unless its pretty<br/>
short, I miss alot of stuff and scroll back later to read it.  I generally<br/>
depend on my wife, who is in the same room to tell me when something is ENRAGED.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is no point in stopping to attack when something is berserk at you<br/>
(your hp are less then 2 bubbles).  You back off or turn off attack and your<br/>
just a sitting target.  Atleast if your going to die you should maximise the<br/>
damage before you do (with crippling blow on, this can be substantial).   So if<br/>
you are in a situation where this happens you either get healed or go down<br/>
fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Last reason, the tanks are twinks and dont know how to play the class properly<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Also, the only time I have walked away from a fight after I turn attack on (to<br/>
get a drink or some such) is if its totally safe (like there is 4 other tanks<br/>
taunting them).  A warrior who goes afk during a non trivial fight is a lazy<br/>
sod.  The warrior is about the only class that can effectively get vellious mobs<br/>
off of clerics.  You have to be waiting for that heal, you have to time your<br/>
disciplines to make sure the mobs stays aggro&#39;d on you.  You have to have taunt<br/>
and disarm (even bash where appropriate) ready and be aware of where the cleric<br/>
and mobs are just in case they do aggro on the cleric.  You have to constantly<br/>
be as close to the mob as possible and watch your distance to maximise the<br/>
effect of taunt.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, the Bard (I love my bard btw :) is a very complex class to play and<br/>
that&#39;s why I enjoy the diversion, but dont assume warriors are a no brainier<br/>
class :)<br/>
<br/>

PS. DEX is used for weapon skill increase unless it is lower then INT, then its<br/>
INT.  Dont know about defense.<br/>

&gt; LOL, I think the majority of warriors hit auto-attack and then go get a<br/>
&gt; beer.  It is nearly impossible to get them to stop attacking no matter how<br/>
&gt; many channels you try and use (tells/ooc/group/shout/guild)<br/>

&gt; Have you ever tried to get them to stop attacking when a mob enrages? Have<br/>
&gt; you ever tried to get them to stop attacking before a heal?  Have you ever<br/>
&gt; asked them what their INT is? *giggles*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why tanks don&#39;t understand that four<br/>
&gt; &gt; tanks beating on something from the front is<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to knock it off the cliff that&#39;s right behind it, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t understand.<br/>
