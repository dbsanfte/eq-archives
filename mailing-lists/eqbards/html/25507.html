<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-477528893">Well, I tried each of the suggestions, and had varying difficulties at each<br/>
one.  Adds, hitpoints, resists...<br/>
<br/>
So, the thing I tried last were the Ulthorks in East Wastes.  In no time at<br/>
all, I was out of 40, and last night, I managed to get out of 41.  :)  2<br/>
dings in 1 day is unheard of for me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the great advice!<br/>
