memory blur (except for the bard of course).  The enchanter&#39;s<br/>
mesmerize spells also do a memory blur about 95% of the time.<br/>
I suspect the percentage is just lower on Strike.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I found Cazic open enough that the enchanter&#39;s mesmerize<br/>
worked better.  The level 15-25 portions of Permafrost are all<br/>
in tight, twisty passages, and the goblins really train there<br/>
(10+ goblins is not uncommon, 20+ is not unheard of).  The<br/>
numbers make it impossible for an enchanter to target them one<br/>
by one, and the close quarters make it pointless for them to<br/>
use area effect mesmerize since it also mesmerizes themselves<br/>
(only spell I know that works like the bard&#39;s L43 song).  So<br/>
that&#39;s when it falls (fell) upon me to whip out Lullaby.<br/>
