<div id="ygrps-yiv-223531229">i agreed with Lyrnia too.  the argument is not to have higher hit points,<br/>
damage output, defensive skills.  that is what makes a warrior/tank.  the<br/>
argument was for AC.  and i agreed the singing steel AC was fine, but others<br/>
thought it could be higher.  this is a very valid point.  the clerics i know<br/>
all have AC a lot higher than me, and that is for a good reason.  like<br/>
clerics, we get our asses beat on a lot playing our songs.  not as much as<br/>
we used to, and that is another huge point, and also why i think the AC is<br/>
fine on singing steel, i mean it&#39;s better than imbrued.  they vastly reduced<br/>
the taunt factor of our songs, and thus made the proc on a level 51+ weapon<br/>
and level 53 song much less useful.  and neither the symphonic harmony proc<br/>
nor the song of dawn can be reliably tested, so who is to say they work at<br/>
all?  also i don&#39;t think summon drink and summon drink are useful at levels<br/>
51+.  i didn&#39;t get 53 levels to give my group food and water.  invisibility<br/>
for a warrior... incredibly useful!<br/>
