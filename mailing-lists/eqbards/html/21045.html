The last time Gordo shot off his mouth about this, it caused everyone to get<br/>
into a tizzy over nothing (ie: Ester basically said that he had no idea what<br/>
was going on in regards to bards).  Therefore, I&#39;ll hold my heated comments<br/>
until Ester herself says that.<br/>

&gt; here&#39;s a quote from Gordon:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes song), chains (level 23<br/>
non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target mes song) be fixed?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we&#39;ve had some other<br/>
things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding<br/>
chains, it&#39;s working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is<br/>
that it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we&#39;ve<br/>
determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<br/>
