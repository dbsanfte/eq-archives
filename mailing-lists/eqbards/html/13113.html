  Well, I didn&#39;t get to test much stuff, but I made observations.<br/>
  And I have a screenshot as well.  Anyway, the observations.<br/>
<br/>
  My equipment:<br/>
<br/>
  Icy greaves, Froglok Crown, Vox Bracer (i gave one away), 2 <br/>
  Peridot plat rings, Runed Bone Fork, Cloak of the Ice bear,<br/>
  Imbrued Boots, misc Lambent bonuses.<br/>
<br/>
  Total cold base:      119<br/>
  Total cold w/ spell:  159<br/>
  Total cold w/ song:   222<br/>
<br/>
  Reso, SoW, Naltron. (~2000 hp)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  You are blasted by freezing winds.  ~800 hp poof, gone.<br/>
  I&#39;d have to estimate the other tanks in the group were taking the <br/>
  same breath weapon damage, with only 140 total cold.  Take that<br/>
  as you may.<br/>
<br/>
  What did make the difference was two clerics chain group healing.<br/>
  And while I still speculate that the random generator&#39;s involvement<br/>
  in how much breath damage you take is large, I can assert that it<br/>
  doesn&#39;t hurt to beef up your cold, if nothing more than to show off.  <br/>
  (I had the highest base cold there)<br/>
<br/>
  Bard Dragon Tactic Observations:<br/>
<br/>
  * Never face the dragon.  This cuts visual lag by 50% easy.<br/>
    And before you say upgrade your computer, I have a P3-450<br/>
    with a Diamond V770 32MB TNT2 Ultra video card in 640x480<br/>
    no graphic options on... It was laggy, Period.<br/>
<br/>
  * Twisting is almost impossible, you have to count and twist<br/>
    in order to get the songs running.  If you wait for the visual<br/>
    or textual cue, it&#39;s too late.  If you don&#39;t face the dragon,<br/>
    twisting is a helluva lot easier.<br/>
<br/>
  * I did not melee, otherwise I was asking the dragon to kill me.<br/>
    I stayed out of dragon melee range, and in my party&#39;s song <br/>
    radius range.  Vox never melee&#39;d me once, although one giant<br/>
    that spawned kept freaking bashing my song off.  Annoying.<br/>
    Although Vox was moving around a lot, I had to compensate to.<br/>
<br/>
  These all may be due to the number of people and the place Vox<br/>
  was pulled to.  Tight quarters and lots of people never goes<br/>
  well with EQ.  It never has since beta.<br/>
<br/>
  I followed pretty much what everyone here said to do.  The battle<br/>
  was fairly smooth I suppose.  If you call throwing 48 people at a<br/>
  dragon, smooth.  heh.  Only a few people died, I don&#39;t know why<br/>
  or under what circumstances, but two of the melee groups had no<br/>
  bard, and they did just fine.  The rogue died I know, after throwing<br/>
  a few BS&#39;s in.  And a couple of tanks who weren&#39;t getting the proper<br/>
  healing, too.  No one in my group died, or LD&#39;d - thank god.<br/>
<br/>
  I expected to cut 50-75% AE breath weapon, and I didn&#39;t notice<br/>
  any big difference between 220ish cold and 140ish cold.<br/>
<br/>
  Screenshots (will only be up for a bit, if someone wants to copy<br/>
               the Vox one somewhere else they can):<br/>
