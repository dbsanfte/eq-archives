<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193139507">I would imagine like most of our songs, the effectiveness of the song is<br/>
relative to your level compared against that of the mobs.  I&#39;m only 22d<br/>
level so haven&#39;t had the chance to play with Chain yet.  <br/>
<br/>
I am currently fighting primarily in Unrest and Mistmoore.  In Unrest, the<br/>
Lullably and Largos&#39; Binding song are pretty reliable, especially if I equip<br/>
an instrument.  I don&#39;t get many resists when I play those two songs.  In<br/>
Mistmoore, the creatures there seem to resist those two songs more<br/>
frequently, especially Largo&#39;s.  I assume that is because the creatures in<br/>
Mistmoore are higher level than those in Unrest.  <br/>
<br/>
When I get Chain at level 23, will it be consistently effective/reliable if<br/>
I use it against creatures that con yellow and red to me?  Based on my prior<br/>
experience, I would assume the answer is no.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Huh?  Chain is snare + it lessens the attackspeed of the mob.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t get it.  What do you think chain does?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will always override every snare/root I see with chains, much<br/>
&gt; more effective for the party.  Slower attacks and the effect of<br/>
&gt; snare.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I chain something, it AINT moving.<br/>
