Hello all, I another of the various lurkers on this list.<br/>
I have noticed the grouping problem myself for 48 (almost 49) level now and<br/>
my solution has been to marry a warrior.(also my real-life husband)<br/>
If we can&#39;t find a group (few and far between) we have no problem hunting<br/>
just the two of us.  Takes longer to level but at least we can still hunt.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Ok, I&#39;m a little confused on this.. do Bards REALLY have a more difficult<br/>
&gt;time grouping?<br/>
&gt;I mean, my wizard friend whines constantly that wizards are not really<br/>
&gt;needed, druids have whined that nobody likes to group with them, even as a<br/>
&gt;shaman  Ispend a lot of lonely nights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So maybe its not that people don&#39;t want bards but its just that some nights,<br/>
&gt;its impossible for anyone to get a group?  Or maybe not ?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I can just see this (try to think about it) ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If bards are the best grouping class in all Everquest,<br/>
&gt; &gt; every group should love to have one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But in the reality of Norath, a bard can hardly find a group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So something is wrong, and i know that&#39;s not the &quot;a bard can<br/>
&gt; &gt; hardly find a<br/>
&gt; &gt; group&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nothing to say more.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Objet : [eqbards] Abashi&#39;s response to a very well thought out post<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, although it was one of the most thoughtful posts I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; seen in a long<br/>
&gt; &gt; time, it got the usual treatment from VI.  Here was Gordon&#39;s response.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; While I&#39;ll leave in-depth determination of &quot;role&quot; to those<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing it, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think that you&#39;ve answered your own question here. Bards are<br/>
&gt; &gt; good at so many<br/>
&gt; &gt; things, you&#39;re surely here to do some of those things. I feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; that Bards<br/>
&gt; &gt; excell at making a good group better. That&#39;s my opinion. What&#39;s more<br/>
&gt; &gt; important though is, what is a bard&#39;s role to you? If you<br/>
&gt; &gt; look at it as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; walking-talking mana battery, there&#39;s not really much I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; do to make you<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel better about it. It&#39;s the same issues with the clerics who often<br/>
&gt; &gt; complain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You are a support<br/>
&gt; &gt; class. You support the group, and you do it very well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Whether or not you<br/>
&gt; &gt; are happy with that role is up to you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Gordon<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pretty pathetic in my opinion.  Obviously Gordon just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There&#39;s a huge difference between the satisfaction one gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; from saving a<br/>
&gt; &gt; comrade&#39;s life (virtual or not) and the satisfaction of<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowing that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; druid can get off one more Careless Lightning because you<br/>
&gt; &gt; stood around and<br/>
&gt; &gt; played mana battery.  What a joke.  Obviously in VI&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Vision&quot; bards are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; meant to be real characters.  Our role is solely to support<br/>
&gt; &gt; other&#39;s efforts.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They should have called the class &quot;Sidekick&quot; instead.<br/>
