<b>Subject:</b> OT: New patch message <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224042773">I found this on another message board:<br/>
<br/>
As you know, there is a scheduled outage this Wednesday where a new<br/>
patch will be installed for Everquest. I have obtained insider<br/>
information on the new proposed game changes:<br/>
<br/>
12/05/99 - New changes with latest patch: (by Trajan of Brell<br/>
Serilis)<br/>
<br/>
WEATHER<br/>
<br/>
Dropped items now have a 25% chance of being swept away during rain<br/>
storms, excluding rusty weapons and foraged grubs, which will now<br/>
litter the landscape for an extra 20 minutes when dropped.<br/>
<br/>
A new NPC &quot;Noah&quot; will wander around Norrath, most often in South<br/>
Karana, looking to round up two of each creature.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PETS<br/>
<br/>
Necro pets have been modified. They will still do the same amount of<br/>
damage in melee, but will now give &quot;the finger&quot; to any monk passing<br/>
by. This behavior can be toggled via the &quot;/pet humble&quot; or &quot;/pet<br/>
arrogant&quot; commands.<br/>
<br/>
New pet commands: /pet sit, /pet SIT (all caps), /pet goddamit<br/>
SIT!!<br/>
<br/>
NPC BEHAVIOR / AI<br/>
<br/>
If you accidently give the wrong combination of items to an NPC or the right <br/>
items to the wrong NPC, the NPC will laugh hideously at you and immediately <br/>
run to the nearest merchant to sell these items, at which point there will <br/>
be no way to re-acquire the misgiven items.<br/>
<br/>
Pathfinding has been improved in zones such as Mistmoore, Everfrost<br/>
and Permafrost. Mobs no longer &quot;appear then disappear, then appear&quot;<br/>
right in front of you. Now they simply appear in front of you without<br/>
any prior visible evidence of their existence.<br/>
<br/>
Mobs will no longer be able to hit/target thru walls & doors - instead in <br/>
select zones, walls and doors will be considered autonomous NPCs which can <br/>
deal damage similar to other monsters in the area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DYING<br/>
<br/>
When dying, you will no longer lose experience. Instead, you will<br/>
have a random number of personal effects disappear (both from your<br/>
person and the bank).<br/>
<br/>
The cleric revive spell will teleport you to your body as well as a<br/>
nearby property insurance agent (GM) who will then tell you you&#39;re out of <br/>
luck if you think you can get any lost items back. The cleric<br/>
ressurrect spell does the same thing but gives you a few animated<br/>
items which disappear when you log.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SPELLS<br/>
<br/>
New Druid Spells: Ring of Desktop (29th), Circle of Desktop (34th) -<br/>
Immediately teleports you to the Windows 98 desktop, thereby aborting<br/>
Everquest; in-game action similar to going link-dead. Circle of<br/>
Desktop has the same results but affects the entire party. Succor:<br/>
Desktop was decidedly left out as it took three times more<br/>
time than required to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL which caused the same effect.<br/>
<br/>
New Shaman Spells: Spirit of GM (Allows you to run faster than SoW in<br/>
opposite direction when asked for assistance)<br/>
<br/>
New Enchanter Spells: Clarify (automatically makes excuses to other<br/>
mage classes as to why you can&#39;t cast Clarity on them)<br/>
<br/>
SKILLS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Female characters now all get Berserk Frenzy once per game month for 3 to 5 <br/>
game days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A new skill has been introduced: &quot;slacking&quot; - Humans, Ogres and Trolls begin <br/>
with a bonus to this skill of 35. It is available to all races. &quot;Slackers&quot; - <br/>
experts in this field will be able to manufacture new game items: <br/>
television, la-z-boy recliner, cheetos, remote control - all of which <br/>
improve hp regeneration while adding to encumberance.<br/>
<br/>
Another new skill: &quot;pimping&quot; is available to all classes except<br/>
Shamen, Enchanters & Druids. Experts in this skill will be able to<br/>
force others around them to cast Sprit of the Wolf on them at will.<br/>
Masters of this skill may force druids to teleport them far out of<br/>
their way while thinking you&#39;re doing them a favor.<br/>
<br/>
Another new skill: &quot;whining&quot; available to all classes but melee<br/>
classes start with 50 skill points, monks start with 60. Masters of<br/>
this skill have the ability to root GMs for extended periods of time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EMOTES<br/>
<br/>
The following new emotes are available with accompanying animation and <br/>
special effects:<br/>
<br/>
/macarena immediately start dancing<br/>
/hurl expunges pieces of food in immediate vicinity<br/>
(sometimes the former may case others around to perform the latter)<br/>
/rap you begin bragging of your wealth<br/>
/gangsta rap same as above but you also swing your weapon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NEW COMMANDS<br/>
<br/>
/youdied? feins linkdead status when a party member dies and you&#39;re a healer<br/>
/oom covertly casts heal and SoW on yourself, and points you in the <br/>
direction of the nearest zone, while telling party you are OOM<br/>

the words &quot;tp&quot; or &quot;sow&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NEW QUEST ITEMS<br/>

guild as the person you are targeting - extremely useful for finding<br/>

weapon in the game, attainable only by killing tons of mobs that all<br/>
con green to you.</div>
