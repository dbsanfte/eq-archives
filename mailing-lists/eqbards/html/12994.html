I am guessing that you&#39;re a female (as your email adress has sarah in it).<br/>

Mr. Senior, we ALL pay for our time -- for some it is just more<br/>
obvious than for others. If you are paying by the<br/>
minute, then playing an engrossing online game may be too high<br/>
an expense to begin with, whether or not you can bind nearby.<br/>
I have friends with over 100 days played time. Even friends<br/>
that can bind nearby, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my friends in England, though are on unlimited plans. They<br/>
are evidently expensive. But that is how they keep their phone<br/>
bills from skyrocketing. It is not Verant&#39;s fault that England<br/>
does their billing of phone calls that way.<br/>
<br/>
Brad has addressed this question. He has said it&#39;s not changing Feel free<br/>
to complain about it still But nothing is going to change. So its just<br/>
complaining at this point.<br/>

&gt;Yeah, it&#39;s still a risk that we shouldn&#39;t have to take, if one of those<br/>
&gt;bouncers gets a stun on you then you&#39;re dead, especially as there are 2<br/>
&gt;outside oggok.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just think that bind affinity should work in all outsdoor zones (be it a<br/>
&gt;city, swamp, desert, commons etc), and there should be a Yes/No box like<br/>
&gt;res, this way people can&#39;t bind someone where they don&#39;t want to be bound.<br/>
&gt;This would stop people from binding inside dungeons and save peoples time<br/>
&gt;if they die.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I come from England and over here we have to pay for our calls, they are<br/>
&gt;charged by the minute. Now this soon adds up and when I have to waste time<br/>
&gt;running across 6 zones to my corpse I&#39;m gonna be pissed. Aswell as having<br/>
&gt;to mem songs and spend an hour getting back the exp I lost. My monthly<br/>
&gt;phone bill is roughly ´┐¢100-120, in $ I would probably say it is about<br/>
&gt;$150-175 per month. If you had to pay that then I think you&#39;d be<br/>
&gt;complaining.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ve rambled enough, I don&#39;t want to start a flame war or anything<br/>
&gt;just my view on the subject.<br/>

&gt;I thought we settled this issue...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;bring extra flutes<br/>
&gt;bag everything and fill as many main slots with extra flutes as you can<br/>
&gt;zone into Ogg<br/>
&gt;get binded there<br/>
&gt;duel your friend and get killed<br/>
&gt;loot every thing except the flutes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now you have a storage corpse - complete with a night&#39;s supply of flutes.<br/>
&gt;Do<br/>
&gt;this a few times and you will see that the storage corpse and flute thing<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;more of a bother than a help and soon you will either selos or sneak by<br/>

&gt;          I find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the<br/>
&gt;Sol&#39;s I have to<br/>
&gt;          run all the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to<br/>
&gt;my corpse,<br/>
