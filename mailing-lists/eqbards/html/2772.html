<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125609155">Ive got that battle drum, and i say it is a MUST for you.  I run almost<br/>
TWICE as fast as i do with a normal drum, which is pretty incredible. <br/>
So whenever you get the chance, pick one up!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have the lute, and did not notice any difference when i<br/>
&gt; &gt; first gotten it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; though i have not tested recently.  You never know it could<br/>
&gt; &gt; have an effect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the future, so its good to have.  I heard the battle<br/>
&gt; &gt; drum you get from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mistmoore has an increased percussion effect too, but I do<br/>
&gt; &gt; not have it yet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A friend of mine got the drum last night but sold it before I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had a chance to test it.  270pp (yes, two hundred and seventy<br/>
&gt; &gt; platinum).  It was enough for him to drop what he was doing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and hop the boat over to deliver the drum to the purchaser.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe it *does* have an increased effect.<br/>
