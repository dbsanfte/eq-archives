<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067505476">I think the song selection is definitely dependent on the mob that you are<br/>
fighting and the situation.  First and foremost I do not even bother to<br/>
memorize DD and COD AE damage songs.  THose seem to be bad songs for<br/>
starting very large trains.  Let me list the combinations based on<br/>
opponent.  THis is for a level 24 bard, I &#39;ll alternative swaps<br/>
<br/>
Dry bone:<br/>
Hymn + Elemental Rhythms + Anthem<br/>
<br/>
Skeletal Monk, Barbed boned, Carrion Ghoul, and other non caster:<br/>
Hymn + Bellow/Chains + Anthem<br/>
<br/>
Hag:<br/>
Hymn + Guardian Rhythms + Anthem<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby is thrown in if the majority of a bad pull con&#39;s even or below.<br/>
Make sure you have a cleric watching your health.  I also have jig memed<br/>
for those extremely long fights.  Trust me you and your buddies will love<br/>
it.  Jig is played while resting because everyone thinks it boost mana<br/>
recovery (I don&#39;t agree but I will have to test it out, just wish we could<br/>
see the actual mana count).<br/>

&gt;      OMW,  what song rotation did you use while in unrest?  I&#39;ve heard that <br/>
&gt;      you must be careful due to the Z axis bug.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      Thanks in advance,<br/>

&gt; Well,<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; I would say level 22 and 23 were two of the longest levels that I had to <br/>
&gt; get out of.  I was in level 22 for about 2 weeks and the same for 23. <br/>
&gt; What you need to do is to get into a good group in Unrest that is camping <br/>
&gt; the barroom or the Hand room.  The xp is great and the spawn is pretty <br/>
&gt; frequent.  And you will find that the group will love you to death.  The <br/>
&gt; last few days that I spent in there have enlightened a lot of people to <br/>
&gt; the value of a bard in a party.  Many times I either replaced a departing<br/>
&gt; warrior or caster and the group has exclaimed after the continuous battles <br/>
&gt; that this is the best group that they have been in.  Hehe it&#39;s good to see <br/>
&gt; people learn the powers of a bard =).  So persevere, you&#39;ll need some good <br/>
&gt; groups to get you out of level 22, 23 is bit easier.  Getting past 24 <br/>
&gt; seemed easy for me, since a majority of the MOBs in the 2nd floor con even <br/>
&gt; and below.  BTW my bad luck came without prepurchasing a song.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok, I have been &quot;stuck&quot; in level 22 for a good long week now.  I think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have found the cause.  Last time I was at the library in HighKeep, I bought <br/>
&gt; &gt; my 23rd level song.  Does anyone else thing buying songs ahead of time is<br/>
&gt; &gt; bad luck???<br/>
