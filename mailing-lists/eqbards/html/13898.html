<div id="ygrps-yiv-416196470">I don&#39;t like them either, but there really isn&#39;t another way.  A level 50 in<br/>
there would lose experience and likely not care on iota.  Besides its only<br/>
fair, the planes are restricted to 46+ why not restrict some zones<br/>
downwards.  Just don&#39;t make anything that&#39;s really cool no drop do it can be<br/>
sold by those of an appropriate level to receive it to those who missed out<br/>
by already being too high.<br/>

&gt; Yes, I thought of that too and it is a problem every time they set up a<br/>
zone<br/>
&gt; for lower levels.  There will be a group of lvl 50&#39;s that will rage thru<br/>
&gt; killing everything just to see what items are dropped even though they<br/>
&gt; probably won&#39;t want any of them.  Just use a little reverse planar logic<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; code the zone to not allow in players of over X level where X is 12 levels<br/>
&gt; above the mean mob level.  That would let them create a dungeon for level<br/>
25<br/>
&gt; mean that would restrict flow of items out due to players of a level that<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t get xp anyhow running in to farm stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like hard limits.  I prefer disincentives.  Make it so<br/>
killing too many green mobs in a short period of time made you<br/>
start to *lose* experience (it&#39;s too easy, and you&#39;re letting<br/>
your skills slide).  :)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, to get this to work, they&#39;d have to balance the<br/>
melee classes so they didn&#39;t die to green mobs...<br/>
