<div id="ygrps-yiv-689089051">Generally we are in locales where one Screech to reduce extra mobs actually<br/>
results in doubling the number of mobs 12 seconds later.  No Chords isn&#39;t<br/>
enchanter friendly, that&#39;s for sure.  Never hit that button by mistake or<br/>
the &#39;chanter will rip you a new one, let me tell ya!  Biggest problem is,<br/>
with only one mob attacking (due to the chanter) Bellow is more effective<br/>
than Psalm unless the mob is way red.  Of course, this could be due to<br/>
Largo&#39;s. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, i sorta discounted chords since you said you always have an enchanter<br/>
and ae dots aren&#39;t really enchanter friendly.  again, screech is good for<br/>
more than<br/>
just running.  i&#39;ve played in several groups where the ranger was good<br/>
enough<br/>
that i could chains til about half health and then the ranger would drop a<br/>
snare on<br/>
it at that point.<br/>
