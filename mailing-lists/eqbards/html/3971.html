<div id="ygrps-yiv-638001492">When you next go up a level immediatly go to a safe area and practice your <br/>
brass song using your Mino Horn.  Carefully watch the screen messages.  <br/>
Eventually you will see a skill increase message showing that Singing, not <br/>
Brass, has increased.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is there any way we can get some confirmation about the minotaur horn&#39;s<br/>
&gt;usage?  I have heard from some that it is only Wind, and now we have <br/>
&gt;someone<br/>
&gt;who claims it also works for Brass...can anyone confirm this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also have a question on this:  can you use the mino horn to raise the<br/>
&gt;brass skill?  Currently my brass is maxed for my level, but I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;lugging around a brass instrument just for this purpose, would be nice if I<br/>
&gt;could sell it back to the vendor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did try the song with the mino horn, and it does work.  But I&#39;m not sure<br/>
&gt;if its because I&#39;m singing it while just holding the horn, or if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;actually using the horn. </span></blockquote></div>
