I&#39;m not entirely convinced by your argument because we&#39;re<br/>
talking in generalities.  Numerically, it could go either way,<br/>
depending on the exact numbers.<br/>

&gt;   quickly.  I missed that in the equation above.  So I would say<br/>
&gt;   in light of that fact alone, sticking a dmg absorbing taunter in <br/>
&gt;   front of the extra giant would be the way to go, since the bard <br/>
&gt;   will not be able to taunt the giant off the healer (regardless<br/>
&gt;   of drowsy or not).  Which makes your solution, ideal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hrmph.  I had absolutely no problem at all keeping the extra<br/>
giant fixated on me instead of the cleric.  Heck, I even had<br/>
to stop weaving songs and attacking from time to time, or BOTH<br/>
giants would&#39;ve been attacking me.  :(  The really odd thing<br/>
is that I haven&#39;t had this problem (mob everyone is attacking<br/>
deciding I should die first) with normal mobs.  The ice giants<br/>
were the first time I&#39;ve faced this amount of bard hatred<br/>
since my low 20s.<br/>
