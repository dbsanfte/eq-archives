<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742851365">Sometimes I think people are too worried about being the &quot;best&quot; or<br/>
contributing the &quot;most&quot; to any given group.  You know what I really enjoy?<br/>
Playing with 6 smart people that know how to play.  Doesnt matter the class.<br/>
Or doing a raid with 3 or 4 groups of friends that you enjoy playing with.<br/>
