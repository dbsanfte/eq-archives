&gt; nah, we have taken the lord with a lvl 50 wiz, 50 war, 44 <br/>
&gt; war, 48 cleric,<br/>
&gt; me (was 44 bard at the time), and 49 wiz. The two high lvl <br/>
&gt; nukers pretty<br/>
&gt; much ate the lord up quickly and then the two boks that where <br/>
&gt; left where<br/>
&gt; easy prey. well not easy but we did it :). However, if the <br/>
&gt; guk knight would<br/>
&gt; have spawned, we probably wouldnt have even attempted it. However, an<br/>
&gt; enchanter of lvl 45+ just makes this a whole heckuva lot <br/>
&gt; easier, and you<br/>
&gt; really cant go wrong with two groups :) </span></blockquote></div>
