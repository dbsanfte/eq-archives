<br/>
He&#39;s a necro, he had an idea then got corrected on it.  Quit bashing for no<br/>
damn reason.  Gordon has never played a bard, and likely never will.<br/>
<br/>
FYI:  I&#39;ve known him, in game, since Beta 2.  He&#39;s a nice guy, fun to hunt<br/>
with and very knowledgeable about his OWN class.  Just like we are.  You<br/>
can&#39;t blame him for not knowing bards.  He&#39;s a mouthpiece, nothing more.  He<br/>
had an idea, offered it up and was wrong and admitted it.<br/>
<br/>
What MORE do you want?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll jump on him anytime he&#39;s blatantly wrong but when he admits his mistake<br/>
give him a break<br/>

&gt; &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can&#39;t twist invis with any other song... it negates it. That<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Doh! Shows you how much I know about bard songs  They are the class in the<br/>
&gt; game that I find the most mysterious.<br/>
