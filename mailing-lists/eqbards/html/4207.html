 </span></blockquote>Hmph, I won $570,603.54 in the 1987 Florida Lottery.  I&#39;m happy as a F***ing lark =)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In fact, the happiest ones tend to be the ones who don&#39;t change their lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Changed my lifestyle alright. I bought a new house, car, and a wife LOL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sense of achievement, contribution, and self-worth are what matters to most.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, I achieved over $150.00 in my bank account for more than 2 consecutive weeks.<br/>
I contributed to charity...once. To get a tax break.<br/>
My self-worth was over half-a-mil! /cheer<br/>
<br/>
LOL, sorry -- couldn&#39;t pass up the humor I saw in that obvious line of bullshit John fed you. No offense John, you make a lot of sense in your posts and I enjoy reading them, but this one tickled me pink.  Ok, Tiger-go get&#39;em. =)<br/>
