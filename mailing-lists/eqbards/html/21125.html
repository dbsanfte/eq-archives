<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197277265">YAK in primary.  It will proc a LOT more there (esp if you have high dex).<br/>
Your dex bonus isn&#39;t applied to your off-hand.<br/>
<br/>
Also, since the Yak is slightly faster (hardly at all tho) you&#39;ll balance<br/>
out the (very slight) damage difference by getting to apply your strength<br/>
bonus more often. And since the yak will proc far more often (if you have<br/>
dex over 100) in your primary hand you&#39;ll more than make up for the<br/>
difference in dmg with the additional procs you&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  I would also recommend a Sionache&#39;s partisan instead of the Yak<br/>
;)  It&#39;s 9/19 and some pretty impressive stat bonuses.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m actually using melee I use a Sionache&#39;s partisan and a Saeiny&#39;s<br/>
Claw.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Weapon selections..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; Well its time for me to call upon the experinced souls here to get some<br/>
advice<br/>
&gt; regarding weapons. I have the following weapons at my disposal:<br/>
&gt; - Ebon Razor (Primary only) Damage 9, Delay 25, +4 fire, cold & magic<br/>
prot.  Wt.<br/>
&gt; 3.5.<br/>
&gt; - Short Sword of the Ykesha:  Damage 8, Delay 24, Weight 4.5.  Effect of<br/>
Ykesha<br/>
&gt; (75 point direct damage spell)<br/>
&gt; - Staff of Writhing 9/33 Diret proc Damage 48<br/>
&gt; - Bladed thullian claws (Primary only). 5/19<br/>
&gt; - Silvery War Axe  6/22<br/>
&gt; Currently Im wielding the Ebon Razor and the yak and I think my damage is<br/>
better<br/>
&gt; than with the yak in primary and Silvery in off hand. But I have my<br/>
doubts. Im<br/>
&gt; not satisfied with the yak being placed in my offhand. Do any of you have<br/>
&gt; suggestions for a better weapon setup?<br/>
&gt; I have been thinking of getting a second yak, but I find the proc is<br/>
resisted<br/>
&gt; quite a lot by kunark mobs atleast.<br/>
