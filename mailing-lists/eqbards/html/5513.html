<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664324594">A similar thing happened to me a couple weeks ago at Unrest...I was zoning<br/>
into Cauldron from Unrest with a 5 mob train on my tail...I thought I was a<br/>
goner as I hit the zone with 1/4 bubble of health and was dropped back to my<br/>
windows desktop instead of the Cauldron corridor.<br/>
<br/>
Frantically I reloaded EQ and clicked login, E&#39;ci Server, blah blah, and<br/>
appeared INSIDE Unrest about 20 yards from the zone line with full health<br/>
and all my possessions, and no monsters anywhere to be found.  Whew!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Want to hear something really bizarre? I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;going through the zone to enter the Keep in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Highpass and when I got through the zone, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;was at the zone border that goes from Kithicor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to Highpass instead of inside the Keep zone. Woops.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ya got hit with an undocumented feature<br/>
&gt; &gt; him back to his last save point.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The thing is, I didn&#39;t die nor was I being attacked<br/>
&gt; or chased. I was a few bubbles down on health due to<br/>
&gt; a previous fight (that ended) and when I rezoned in<br/>
&gt; the wrong place I was at full health. So that was<br/>
&gt; nifty at least - but at the time of hitting the zone,<br/>
&gt; I was nowhere near death and again, not being attacked.<br/>
