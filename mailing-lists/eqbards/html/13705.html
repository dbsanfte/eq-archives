<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-543992127">I keep forgetting to test this for myself whenever I log on.  I always start<br/>
talking with my guild and friends every time I log on and then kick myself<br/>
when I log off for forgetting.  Anyway..<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tested the level 30 song (FCC) since the recent patch to see if<br/>
equipping a drum now increases the effect of the song (more DOT damage and<br/>
more MR debuff)? If it has been fixed, does a MM battle drum increase the<br/>
effect even more?<br/>
<br/>
Also, does the MR debuff from FCC stack with the MR debuff from Pixie<br/>
Strike?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
