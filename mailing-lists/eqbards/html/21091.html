<div id="ygrps-yiv-610210936">I read the everwhine boards, the eqcaster&#39;s boards, and the vault boards<br/>
pretty regularly.  I don&#39;t believe Verant really uses the info at their<br/>
disposal to make those judgments correctly.  That&#39;s the whole point.  They<br/>
do have the info and I think they still make stupid decisions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s the point.  none of us can know how big the problem really is.  we<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
have enough data.  but verant can and does.  which is why they prioritize<br/>
the bug<br/>
fixes/feature adds and we don&#39;t.  when you say &#39;&#39;from seeing the boards&#39;&#39;, i<br/>
assume<br/>
you go to all the class specific and the sony boards and you don&#39;t see<br/>
hundreds of<br/>
posts from other classes on bugs or people posting on general bugs that need<br/>
fixing <br/>
too?  or do you just read the bard board?<br/>
