<div id="ygrps-yiv-987629487">I haven&#39;t even dropped an item accidently since my early 20&#39;s (dinged to 43<br/>
today).  I was fighting Hornets near the Hornet&#39;s nest in Burning Wood.  A<br/>
couple party members left - so we were down to three when about 4 hornets<br/>
aggro on us.  I was using Sow since we did a lot of kiting - and of course<br/>
it runs out.  I decide it&#39;s time &quot;for the better part of valor&quot; and start to<br/>
run to zone.  By then health getting really low and running real slow even<br/>
with Selo&#39;s - because I had weapons equipped.  So I start to switch weaps to<br/>
MM Drum - and I drop it.<br/>
<br/>
	My friends tried to find the drum - but to no avail.  Keep in mind the the<br/>
ground is very brown in that section of the zone.  After I ran to the zone<br/>
with a hand drum and dropped it on the ground to test - you basically had to<br/>
know exactly where to look at find it.  Whatever genius decided to a drum a<br/>
single stick on the ground should be pistol-whipped.<br/>
<br/>
	Thinking about all our talk &quot;confirm switches&quot; and such - it seems  to me<br/>
that could solve the problem by simply not treating a click as a drop in the<br/>
area near the hotkeys...<br/>
<br/>
	Anyway - it sure is frustrating to to lose an item that goes for between<br/>
750-1000p (on Xegony at least the last time I checked) due to a poor<br/>
interface and graphic design...  At least camping a new one; shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
very difficult with myself and guildmates in our 40&#39;s...<br/>
