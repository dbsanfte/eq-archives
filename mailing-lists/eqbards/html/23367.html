<b>Subject:</b> Question on &quot;Drafting&quot; <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715028">Greeting everyone I have a question on a technique called &quot;Drafting&quot;.  My<br/>
regular group of friends I group with don&#39;t want me to fall to far behind on xp<br/>
while I am out for my son&#39;s impending birth (my wife would kill me if I attempt<br/>
to play for the first month).<br/>
<br/>
I was told that with the new xp changes that you can group with a higher level<br/>
player in my case a 53 shaman whose toons I group with would take my bard and<br/>
group. He would then procedd to solo mobs and let me get the xp.<br/>
<br/>
The figures I saw (in an email) says the lower level character could &quot;draft&quot; or<br/>
ride the xp off of the higher level shaman.  They are estimating the lower level<br/>
would get about 40% of the xp from such a scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions on powerleviling and recent discussion on mediocre players aside (I<br/>
have played EQ since it came out and have several characters in the 20&#39;s and<br/>
30&#39;s) would this form of powerleveling be an option? Or is the math wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>
<br/>
