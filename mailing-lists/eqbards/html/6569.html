&gt;      soon as you see it pulse, or can you weave it with 2 other songs?  It <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It will put the mobs to sleep anywhere from 0 to 3 pulses<br/>
(random, and different for each mob).  So you can leave it<br/>
running, restart it every time it stops, or you can weave it<br/>
with others songs.  It is most effective when you stop it and<br/>
restart it every pulse (shortens the time between pulses from<br/>
6 seconds to about 3.5 seconds - vital for interrupting<br/>
casters). If the situation is not that bad, you can relax for<br/>
a change and just leave it running.  If the situation is even<br/>
more in hand, you can weave it with another song (I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
recommend two).  Sometimes in the right circumstances, I&#39;ll<br/>
weave it with a song in bad situations - e.g. to heal when the<br/>
cleric goes OOM and everyone has taken damage, or buff our<br/>
magic resist when we&#39;re being hit by a caster.  Higher level<br/>
mobs break out of it more quickly so make sure you group kills<br/>
them first.<br/>
<br/>
The song does not seem to work very well at L15, but gets<br/>
better quickly.  Around L17 you&#39;ll wonder how you ever lived<br/>
without it.  Lately though at L34 I&#39;m finding mobs break out<br/>
of it much more often than I remember from my youth.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure if this is due to a general nerfing of the song, or if<br/>
the increased toughness of higher level blue-con mobs is the<br/>
cause.  It works better if you have a lute equipped at L34,<br/>
though I don&#39;t remember a lute making that big a difference at<br/>
L17.  Charisma is supposed to help too, though nobody has been<br/>
able to quantify it.<br/>
<br/>
When you get Pixie Strike at L28, you&#39;ll find Strike is more<br/>
relabile at holding 1-2 mobs.  The enchanter&#39;s mesmerize is<br/>
also preferable for this reason.  But if you ever get into a<br/>
situation with 4+ mobs and the enchanter can&#39;t/is afraid to<br/>
area effect mesmerize, this song will save your butts.  The<br/>
main problem seems to be if you group regularly with the same<br/>
people, they get used to this song letting them tackle trains,<br/>
and when you&#39;re not with them they may try to do the same<br/>
thing and die quickly.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The song is also great at getting mobs off your casters.  It<br/>
does *not* clear the hate list, but it does make them hate you<br/>
more rather quickly, which is ok since we&#39;re decent tanks.<br/>
While they&#39;re nodding, they&#39;re not interrupting the caster&#39;s<br/>
spells, so your friends will be able to cast more reliably.  <br/>
My cleric friend loves this song because without it in<br/>
multiple mob situations, the unengaged mobs tend to jump on<br/>
the her after she heals anyone.  She says if that happens, she<br/>
just stands next to me for a few pulses and the mobs start<br/>
attacking me again.<br/>
