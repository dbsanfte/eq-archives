<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923217066">I suppose one would only know if one had a reference of when a spell or<br/>
effect was actually broken and it was obviously a major exploit. A few<br/>
examples: (mostly second hand...)<br/>
<br/>
1.	Bellow first came out doing 35 or so points a shout, 50&#39;s at level 20.<br/>
You can almost drop a red creature without having to even run from it. It<br/>
was an exploit because the song was too powerful. I hear some, however,<br/>
thought it perfectly natural... They soon toned it down to where it<br/>
currently is.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Ever notice how a creature can hit you no matter how high or low it is<br/>
from you as long as the horizontal distance is within an attack range? Good<br/>
example is to run something under the East Karana bridge and get up on it.<br/>
The distance from the water to the bridge is well beyond a swing from even<br/>
Broon but you can still get hit. You can&#39;t attack back however. The reason<br/>
for this was that some people were casting levitate on themselves, moving<br/>
off a high point, and nuking creatures below with spells. Verant changed<br/>
things so that these creatures could attack back regardless of how high up<br/>
the player is. Fortunately, the KOS range doesn&#39;t seem to be like that.<br/>
<br/>
3.	Jumping. Heh. You used to be able to jump continuously all over the place<br/>
without running out of stamina. With this you could keep ahead of most<br/>
creatures without needing accelerando and you could just straight Bellow<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
4.	I Heard some damage spells came out that did large amounts of damage for<br/>
insanely small amounts of mana. The persistent damage spells were common<br/>
since it isn&#39;t a 1 mana = 1 damage ration sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
	The way I look at it is if there is no way *ever* for the creature to hit<br/>
you, you are exploiting. I&#39;ve been hit plenty of times while kiting. Your<br/>
decision though.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

I&#39;ve been reading the messages about kiting but I have never done it. As of<br/>
yet, I don&#39;t really have strong enough songs to perform it effectively.<br/>
My question is: why is it an exploit? Certain songs/spells have a ranged or<br/>
radius effect. What if I&#39;m out singing (don&#39;t have a lute or mandolin yet)<br/>
the Chords of Discord (hurts my throat) and killing beasties. While looting<br/>
a corpse I&#39;m set upon by a beastie that I feel is too tough for me. I begin<br/>
to run from it. Getting lost, I run around in circles reading messages that<br/>
the beastie winces and I occasionally take damage. Let&#39;s say that I<br/>
accidentally kill the beastie before it kills me.<br/>
Have I exploited a bug or not? I was running away the entire time. Is it my<br/>
fault that the beastie is so enraged it will follow me to the ends of<br/>
Norrath (or the nearest zone wall)? If this is exploiting a bug, what is<br/>
the bug? Is the bug the fact that I have a song that can damage beasties at<br/>
range or that I can run as fast or faster than some or that beasties chase<br/>
you?<br/>
What if I had a missle weapon and was singing Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Running<br/>
backwards, I am faster than some beasties. By throwing daggers or axes at<br/>
them I stay out of range and they take damage. Taking damage they will<br/>
continue to follow me in which case, I will continue to lob whatever I can<br/>
at them. Is this exploiting a bug? It seems like the same situation, but is<br/>
now OK.<br/>
I am confused and a little scared. Who decides where the fine line between<br/>
clever and exploitation is? I fear to try new things only to discover that<br/>
I&#39;ve &#39;cheated&#39; and will now be banned.<br/>

&gt;Kiting is an &quot;exploit,&quot; apparently, officially.<br/>

&gt;Check this quote about exploits:<br/>
&gt;Farming - using broken spells or specific spell effects to kill, drag, or<br/>
&gt;lure monsters, thus gaining experience/loot from them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Boom.  Right there, they are looking for that kind of business.  Don&#39;t do<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
