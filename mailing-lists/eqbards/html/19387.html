<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087263999">Woohoo!  I got my mm drums this weekend.  I&#39;m running all of the place just<br/>
for the heck of it now (wait, I did that all the before anyway)!<br/>
<br/>
No major story to tell.  Grouped with a monk last week who an alt for a 52<br/>
wizard.  He offered to sell them to me since he had decided not to make a<br/>
bard.  Got a good deal on them at only 500pp!<br/>
<br/>
Now I just have to make enough plat to bank a few upcoming songs and then<br/>
it&#39;s back to Kunark at light speed!<br/>
