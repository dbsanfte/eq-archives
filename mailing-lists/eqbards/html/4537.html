<div id="ygrps-yiv-322244073">Wow, sounds really cool.  So where are you posting the pictures.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t have a place to post them I would be willing to post them all on my<br/>
site.  Either email me about posting them or please give us an address where<br/>
we can see them.<br/>

&gt; Got past the spectres in the tunnels and eventually ran up a ramp guarded<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; 3 DBS&#39;s and a named Necro.<br/>
&gt; Sorry, no time for introductions! Have a date with Mr. Thule! &lt;&lt;-- said as<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; ran by. =)<br/>
&gt; Zoned in and WOAH! What a view!<br/>
&gt; Tons of new critters and some re-hashed(old art) familiar ones with<br/>
&gt; different names.<br/>
&gt; The one that caught my eye was a Dracolich. H-U-G-E bone dragon-type<br/>
thing!<br/>
&gt; I am assuming it would eat me really fast so I just stayed my distance and<br/>
&gt; took a few pictures.<br/>
&gt; There is a castle surrounded by a lake of fire. Not your regular lava here<br/>
&gt; bud. This is FIRE. Looks really cool.<br/>
&gt; Looked around for about 30 minutes carefully avoiding ALL creatures<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; everything cond Red as Lenin to me (of course).<br/>
&gt; Took about 50 megs worth of Screenshots. I especially like the one where I<br/>
&gt; top a hill and bump into Cazic Thule himself. YIKES!<br/>
&gt; Run away!  Lord Thule begins shouting something about infidels and such,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I had no time to chit-chat with him, for these big-o-ape-like guys named<br/>
&gt; Shiverbacks took an interest to me along with their buddy the<br/>
Phantasm(looks<br/>
&gt; like a fat spectre).<br/>
&gt; I saw a wisp-like critter, but was not close enough or in a stable enough<br/>
&gt; state of mind to target it to get its name. However, I DID see an<br/>
animation<br/>
&gt; next to it. Hmm. Wisp pet? Cool!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll have to go through my SS&#39;s to get the name of most of these, as I am<br/>
&gt; posting directly after logging off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have fun!<br/>
&gt; Oh, BTW I used my 13th level gnome magician to run around in there because<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; wanted to bind inside in case I got killed so I would not have to run all<br/>
&gt; the way back. =) SCARY! (is that a run-on?)<br/>
