<b>Subject:</b> Question about Brass Instruments and the Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017025427">I was wondering where I could buy a brass instrument (there doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
be any in Kelethin, a minotaur horn isn&#39;t a brass instrument so I assume<br/>
that the regular horn in the guild shop isn&#39;t one either) and what is the<br/>
TRUE use of Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon?  I know you have to target<br/>
yourself, but the song keeps ended after one pulse.  Is it supposed to do<br/>
that?  I haven&#39;t seen any improvement in merchant prices either, is that<br/>
maybe I don&#39;t have a brass instrument equipped when I sing it?  Are you<br/>
supposed to click on the merchant when you have the song icon in the active<br/>
spells area?<br/>
