<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503587695">first head piece i ever had was bronze helm, i remember getting it in lake<br/>
rathe and putting it on for the first time.  after we were done laughing, i<br/>
realized i would never be wearing plate as a wood elf.  leather and chain<br/>
look isn&#39;t nearly as awful, <br/>
<br/>
that is pretty much a list of what i went through in head pieces.  i hated<br/>
any graphic so much i went with a simple old woven cap first, then the fine<br/>
silk turbin (if you can get it that cheap, it&#39;s very nice for that price if<br/>
you really want no graphic), then froglok crown (actually it&#39;s 12 AC but<br/>
still one of the best no graphic items), and now tranix (the +something is<br/>
20 SV Magic, probably the best bard head item i can think of in the game).<br/>
i still always carry around my imbrued helm on me for laughs.  at raids i<br/>
get people yelling at me to put it on and others screaming not to.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Get one of the following:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stone Circlet:  Najena, off goblins.  AC 6, no graphic, no bonuses<br/>
&gt; Fine Silk Turban:  Usually relatively cheap (seen them sell <br/>
&gt; as low as 100pp)<br/>
&gt; 10ac +10FR<br/>
&gt; Lumberjack Hat:  10AC +5 something<br/>
&gt; Crown of the Froglok Kings:  13AC +20FR +20CR<br/>
&gt; Crown of King Tranix:  13AC +something +15 Charisma<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of the above have NO Graphics ;)  I currently have the <br/>
&gt; froggy crown.<br/>
&gt; What I used for a VERY long time was an Executioners hood (looks like<br/>
&gt; leather) 4ac +4str +9dex (which is better than banded and/or <br/>
&gt; plate imho)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck!!!<br/>
