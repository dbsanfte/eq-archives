<div id="ygrps-yiv-560233985">Has the DoT portion of CoC been quantified?<br/>
<br/>
We were fighting frogs in the Frenzy room of lower guk last night and we<br/>
frequently had multiple pulls (we had a psycho Erudite Paladin pulling).<br/>
I&#39;d sing Berserker, Niv&#39;s, CoC.  Everyone assisted wonderfully and the first<br/>
would drop.  We would turn to the next weaker frog, sometimes a Wan (and<br/>
yes, he&#39;d been beating on me) and he would have a noticable amount of his<br/>
health gone - half a bubble maybe.  I think the CoC DoT is pretty<br/>
significant, but I&#39;d like some quantitative evidence.<br/>
<br/>
Before CoC I was with you, I often did not have Binding and Chains loaded.<br/>
In that instance Binding only has a minor AC drop and a AE effect over<br/>
Chains.  Well I don&#39;t want mobs agrod on me if all I&#39;m doing is slowing them<br/>
and dropping their AC, however, with a DoT component I feel that it&#39;s worth<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I long for the day when a fully functional Lullaby complicates my decisions<br/>
here.  Twisting Berserker/VoV, Niv&#39;s and Lullaby?  /drool<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have enough difficulty deciding which songs to keep<br/>
&gt; memorized.  If I&#39;m going to have Chain loaded for emergencies,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d rather not have to keep Binding loaded.  Also, the<br/>
&gt; slowdown for CoC is not as great as for Chain/Binding from my<br/>
&gt; tests.<br/>
