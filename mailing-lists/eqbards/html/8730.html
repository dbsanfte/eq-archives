<b>Subject:</b> Begging again <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491182954">I hit 40 begging skill over the weekend and the difference is<br/>
like night and day.  Whereas with a skill of 39 I&#39;d have to<br/>
beg 5 or 10 times for each success (targeting amiable paladin<br/>
guards in North Freeport), at 40 skill I&#39;m succeeding more<br/>
than half the time.  The success rate still stinks with the<br/>
dubious militia guards in West Freeport though.<br/>
<br/>
I still get 1 cp per successful beg.  I&#39;ve had one paladin<br/>
give me 1 sp, but that&#39;s it.  All my other successes have<br/>
yielded only 1 cp.  My guildmates are complaining that I&#39;m<br/>
giving the guild a bad reputation by begging around the bank<br/>
so much.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I estimate I&#39;ve successfully begged close to two hundred times<br/>
(I dumped something like 35 practice points into the skill),<br/>
and the paladins are still amiable to me.  I once begged from<br/>
one paladin nonstop for half an hour, and he never got upset<br/>
or attacked me.  The dubious milita has not attacked me<br/>
either.  I did beg from the dubious S. Ro dark elf merchants<br/>
and they got upset and attacked me.  Fortunately, it was a<br/>
drive-by beg (target them from a distance, run by at full<br/>
speed with Accelerando and a drum, and hit beg just as I pass)<br/>
so they didn&#39;t even hit me.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How DARE you beg from me!&quot;  :-)<br/>
