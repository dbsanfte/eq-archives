<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582844880">*&gt; Are there any differences between the various different <br/>
*instruments?  (like<br/>
*&gt; between a lute and a mandolin)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I saw in beta that the mandolin was usable by &quot;All&quot; whereas the<br/>
Lute was usable by &quot;BRD&quot; only.</div>
