<div id="ygrps-yiv-22317210">Lol your kidding right? Overcrowding isn&#39;t a problem? It&#39;s not a problem<br/>
with 3 planes are being done and both dragons yet we still have 80+ in guk<br/>
and sol b? all quests are basiclaly messed up but it&#39;s not causing huge<br/>
problems like overcrowing. Lol heh check again I thin kyour thinking of guk<br/>
not lower guk because on E&#39;ci it&#39;s camped 24/7. As for quest at high levels<br/>
it&#39;s the same thing as camping only you camp two diffrent spawns. I&#39;ve got a<br/>
21 shaman who has been doing quite fine in East Karana a under populated<br/>
zone. Sol A is quite doable at 21-24 and is actually a good zone to hunt in.<br/>
Upper Guk is often empty on E&#39;ci so check there. Lower guk is another story<br/>
and arey ou use you didn&#39;t zone in and do a who on guk instead of going<br/>
through guk into lower guk?  Fact of the matter is I&#39;ve found places that<br/>
are baren where I can hunt in even during prime time on mid level chars. Try<br/>
doing that as a high level.<br/>

&gt;able<br/>
&gt;&gt;to do enough to keep up with the level 50 players unless they totally<br/>
&gt;ignore<br/>
&gt;&gt;the lower level players.  The majority of the level 50 players play the<br/>

&gt;&gt;Actually you get to play a new class so not boring. They have to fix<br/>
&gt;&gt;overcrowding with high levels first and their is no reason they should<br/>
&gt;&gt;bother with anything else until that happens otherwise Verant will lose a<br/>
&gt;&gt;good percentage of their customers.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think I stated pretty clearly in my original post that I&#39;m glad Verant<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;giving the high level characters something to do.  This might keep you<br/>
&gt;guys<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;busy until expansion.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;My points about neglecting 46- level characters is still valid however.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Since this game has been out, players have consistently begged Verant to<br/>
&gt;&gt;add<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;more quality quests to the game.  With the exception of the class armor<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;quests, most of the other quests for low and medium level characters flat<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;out suck and aren&#39;t worth the time and effort.  Is it too much to expect<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;that as the game evolves over time, Verant will make improvements to all<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;aspects of the game?  You yourself stated the 50 level players are bored<br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;thats why they start twink characters.  It sure would be nice if those<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;twinks had something different to look forward to (new items and quests).<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;As it stands now, all they get to do is the stuff their 50th level<br/>
&gt;&gt;character<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;has probably already done countless times over.  How boring.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing what do you think us 46+ players had to play with? Guess what<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; low levels are having a ton more fun then us high levles why do you<br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many of us twink? They have to do something about high levels because<br/>
&gt;&gt;they<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are the most unhappy there are only two zones excluding planes that<br/>
&gt;&gt;people<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do sol b and guk. DO you have any clue how crowded it is? We were doing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bothg planes and both dragons at the same time on E&#39;ci and guess what<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is still 80+ people in guk and sol b. This is a major problem and they<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; need<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to fix the problem not add stuff for low levels who are just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>complaining<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;obtain three items to get the reward.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Abashi posted earlier that 200+ class specific items were included in<br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;new patch.  It appears that most, if not all, of these 200+ items are<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;related to the PoA quests. Each class gets six quests.  Thats 84 new<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;is the apparent lack of attention given to players less than 46th<br/>
