To find the pickclaws in highkeep - go to the bank.  Hmm, don&#39;t know the<br/>
bank?  Ok, wander around until you find the room with the room clerk or<br/>
innkeep? Then at the other end of that room is a way to go downstairs.<br/>
Explore until you find the banker behind a counter. Now at the other end of<br/>
the bank is another stairs going down - next to a miner.  Go down those<br/>
stairs and look for another flight going down.  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is the first pickclaw room - pickclaw guards spawn here.  Off to<br/>
one side is a room where 2 pickclaw lookouts spawn (weakest ones of all<br/>
pickclaw gobs - prolly too green)  At the other end of this room - you<br/>
guessed it - another set of stairs - this is called the ramp.  The first<br/>
room on right is the warrior room.  Warriors are the next stronger ones from<br/>
guards.  Follow the hall further down and you will find the raider room -<br/>
where the strongest of all spawn.<br/>
<br/>
At 32, you can be in either raider room or warrior room groups.  Typically,<br/>
you go down and ask groups if there is room for you - stating level and<br/>
class.  You may have to wait 20 or 30 minutes for an opening - or camp<br/>
guards until an opening in warrior room or raider room is offered.  <br/>
<br/>
Last week - Flurry Dovesong - a bard was camping high keep - she prolly<br/>
still there.  Tell I said hi!<br/>
<br/>
Other places:  South Karana - harriers and avocets  - partner or group,<br/>
maybe solo; Cazic Thule - Tae room or 4C  -- definitely grouped; Sol-A with<br/>
a good group; Sol-B maybe a bit young unless you get in a good group with<br/>
some experience.  Rathe Mts - cyclops - grouped or good partners. Hill<br/>
Giants - def a good group.  Oasis - spectres - def a good group.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t solo - but some do - Choon & Froon in West Karana with charm.  Some<br/>
claim they do HG&#39;s in  Rathe Mts with charm. <br/>
<br/>
In any case - welcome! What is your bards name?<br/>
<br/>

		Im level 32 now! Not too sure where to fight or what to<br/>
kill. If any one has<br/>
		any clue that would be great. To be honest I know of lower<br/>
guk, but I hate<br/>
		that place with a passion!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
		I was told that High hold keep would be good in the warriors<br/>
room, fighting<br/>
		pickclaws?  I dont know my way in HHK at all. I am on<br/>
Innourkk server. Can<br/>
		any one show me the way there or another spot to fight? Or<br/>
some detailed<br/>
		info :) thanks all........<br/>
