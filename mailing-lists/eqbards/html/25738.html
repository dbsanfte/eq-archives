<div id="ygrps-yiv-66338932">HQ bearpelts are the only skins you&#39;ll get a good price on from the commons -- 2pp is prolly about right for the others...that&#39;s 40p a stack and much easier to find than HQ bearpelts for the same price ...  Another thing you can do is sell deathfist belts (or crushbone belts and lego pads, etc.)  These quests are quite good and there is no shortage of twinks buying them for up to 5pp each.<br/>
(I am using prices for Rodcet Nife.  Your server may be a bit different).<br/>
My opinion on tradeskills is that they are designed to be a money sink and protect server economies...kind of like 100k horses -- it takes cash out of circulation P<br/>
Better gear means less downtime.  <br/>

*slaps self on forehead*  I had a HQ bear pelt a couple days back and <br/>
tried to auction it but when i got no response i sold it to a <br/>
merchant... DOH!  I will never make that mistake again!  What I did <br/>
last night after reading this message: I took all the cat pelts i had <br/>
looted in freeport back to kelethin (where there are no cats) and <br/>
sold the medium quality ones for 2pp each.  <br/>
<br/>
My biggest question is,  How do I know what prices pelts go for?  I <br/>
am starting to become quite the fur trapper, and I think I can fund <br/>
my blacksmithing lessons by selling fur (i am always going back and <br/>
forth between freeport and g.faydark)  I tried to look for others <br/>
auctioning pelts but didnt see anything.<br/>
<br/>
maybe some kind soul can list fair prices for the cat and bear pelts, <br/>
mainly so i don&#39;t feel like i am ripping other PC&#39;s off, but also so <br/>
i dont rip myself off.  I was asking 5pp ea. for HQ cat pelts last <br/>
night and i got one &quot;no thanks.&quot; was that too high a price?  I did <br/>
manage to sell 5 medium quality cat pelts for 2pp ea., and a bunch of <br/>
spiderling silks for 1 gp ea.<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps there is some internet site out there that lists this kind <br/>
of thing?  all i found so far on the net are people auctioning armor <br/>
and weapons and such...  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.<br/>

&gt; Hi Fohat,<br/>
&gt; Magical weapons are always dropping in price and one of the best <br/>
times to buy them is during off-peak hours in the Commons.  Why?  <br/>
Because people get tired of trying to sell stuff and want to get some <br/>
sleep -- You never know what cool deals you&#39;ll find. )<br/>
&gt; Look for a dragoon dirk if you can.  They go for 30-40pp and when <br/>
you upgrade, it can sit in your range slot and you&#39;ll still get the <br/>
MR and dex from it...I carried a dragoon dirk in my range slot until <br/>
I could afford a Runed Bone Fork.  If you don&#39;t have  30-40 pp then <br/>
hunt bears until you get a HQ pelt and auction it for 40pp or trade <br/>
for a dragoon dirk -- You might get lucky and a tailor with extra <br/>
gear in the bank will give you a deal...<br/>
&gt; Find a friend who has luclin and ask him/her to buy you those <br/>
songs.  If you are in a guild, it should be easy -- if you are not in <br/>
a guild, look for one -- guilds offer a whole new perspective on the <br/>
game if you join a good one.<br/>
&gt; Warsong is a self-only buff and it is a bit better than anthem <br/>
which is for grouping -- I recommend it highly if you are soloing -- <br/>
but with hymm under your belt, you&#39;ll be a welcome addition to most <br/>
groups. ...and bellow WILL tell you the damage you do.  I used it for <br/>
pulling until I hit lvl 30.  Damage is unimpressive from this song <br/>
but it costs no mana and is seldom resisted and is a good interupt <br/>
when you fight/duel casters.  you&#39;ll get a lot of use from it )<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am nearly ready to take on some Willo-whisps (i am almost lvl 11)<br/>
&gt; but I need a good *cheap* magic weapon, as my tarnished broad sword <br/>
&gt; aint gonna cut it.  How much can I expect to pay for a weapon that <br/>
&gt; will do the trick?  I am on a tight budget right now, what with <br/>
&gt; buying songs and learning to smith :)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, when soloing which do you prefer: Anthem de arms, or <br/>
Whistling <br/>
&gt; warsong?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also Also, how hard is it to get that other level 9 song I heard <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; only be gotten in Luclin, &quot;Magical Monologue&quot;  (of course I&#39;ll have <br/>
&gt; to buy the exp first) so that i can save my Platinum and not have <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; buy a magic weapon?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also Also Also does the bellow that bards get at lvl 12 affect <br/>
&gt; creatures that can only be hit with magic weapons, and does that <br/>
song <br/>
&gt; show you how much dammage you are delivering (whereas the chords of <br/>
&gt; disonance only say &quot;Large Spider winces&quot; etc)?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening!<br/>
