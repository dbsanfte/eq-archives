Obviously I could since I survived.  The point was whether<br/>
it&#39;d be more effective to have a real tank tank it (at the<br/>
cost of losing his damage on the primary target).<br/>
<br/>
One nice side effect of having all the extras on me was that<br/>
almost our entire group managed to zone when we overpulled and<br/>
got 4.  I played Screech, and surprisingly it stuck most of<br/>
the time.  The giants ran, my guild (2 groups) ran.  When the<br/>
giants stopped running, they were only interested in summoning<br/>
me, and I&#39;d just fear them again.  I stayed alive long enough<br/>
doing this that all but one of the others were able to make it<br/>
to the zone without being summoned.  (We decided evac was out<br/>
of the question since getting back from North Karana would&#39;ve<br/>
taken so long.)<br/>
