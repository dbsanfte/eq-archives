&gt;      Bummer.  I ran into a Necro that had the same attitude.  Not in the<br/>
&gt;      mood to argue I just played jig evey once and awile (when I was doing<br/>
&gt;      nothing else) to shut him up.  (just the two of us and I could tell <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt;      amount of arguing whould change his mind)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Perhaps you should have just run a test right then and there.  Have a<br/>
&gt;      caster cast a spell, have someone else time it, med, Repeat with jig,<br/>
&gt;      med.   This would have proved to your group what an idiot he was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      The big problem is that seversl of the big web sites list the jig <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;      this capability!!!! (EQstratics is one I think) We need to all <br/>
&gt;contact<br/>
&gt;      these web sites and get them to correct this error.  This would at<br/>
&gt;      least help the situation.<br/>

EQ? Naw, taking a MUCH needed break after losing my level twice today and <br/>
dying a 3rd time while attempting to build an xp buffer. Lag deaths and <br/>
being trained by newbies while you&#39;re trying to kick your friend&#39;s ass in a <br/>
duel tends to be slightly frustrating. &quot;Hey Sart, the duel was cut short due <br/>
to your untimely death..&quot; =(<br/>
