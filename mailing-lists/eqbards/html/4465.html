&gt;           Great stuff! (how&#39;s Finland these days) But I am curious how you <br/>
&gt;      came to the Damage +1 equaling the average damage potential of a <br/>
&gt;      weapon.  I pretty sure your right, from observed damage while playing <br/>
&gt;      but is there something you know that confirms this.  For example do <br/>
&gt;      you know how to calculate Max damage?<br/>

lots of rain. So soon we will have a way too wet fall ;)<br/>
<br/>
  Well, for the under 20th level guys the damage is pretty much<br/>
dmg*2 + 1 max. And max+min is dmg*2+1+1, thus easier to<br/>
just use dmg+1. We are comparing only efficiency, so can use<br/>
that form.<br/>
<br/>
  As for higher end guys and the strength bonuses into damage.<br/>
Read somewhere a guy from Verant say they are fixed. However<br/>
fixed +damage would be ridiculous, so it has to be fixed +%damage.<br/>
As such, it does not really matter that much if you do or don&#39;t add<br/>
them to the computations.<br/>
