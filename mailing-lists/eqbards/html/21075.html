<div id="ygrps-yiv-138160928">If the higher priority items were truly along those lines - I&#39;d strongly<br/>
agree with you.  But do you truly believe that for the past, lets say three<br/>
or four months (by which time this bug has &quot;aged&quot; long enough for my comment<br/>
to be valid) - every item addressed by the testing department has been those<br/>
type of serious problems?<br/>
<br/>
Secondly - it seems that there are only one or two testers for the Live<br/>
team.  IMHO this is woefully inadequate.  Doesn&#39;t Verant say they have<br/>
approx 300,000 subscribers?  Three million dollars a month revenue only buys<br/>
us two testers?  I hope there are more testers quietly working away out of<br/>
the spotlight...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I do believe that we need to have a certain amount of &quot;Squeaky<br/>
Wheel&quot; mentality.  Albeit politely, and no flames.  I do believe I worded my<br/>
comments in a &quot;non-whining&quot; manner. We&#39;ve been quietly, patiently waiting<br/>
for this issue to be addressed - I don&#39;t want to see it pushed to the<br/>
backburner.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly - since I made my post this morning - I found this thread from the<br/>
Concert Hall<br/>

Perhaps you saw that when you made this comment - I hadn&#39;t seen it until<br/>
after I saw your comment.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the &quot;higher priority&quot; duping problem Abashi was talking about<br/>
was the programmer assisting Ester - not Ester&#39;s testing of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Reading the threads above - I AM worried that the testing being done (so far<br/>
at least) if they&#39;re testing in Qenyos Hills - they may be testing low level<br/>
Bard on Low Level mobs.  We KNOW the problem with Lullaby doesn&#39;t arise<br/>
until higher levels.  I sure hope they are also testing with different<br/>
levels of charisma.<br/>
<br/>
Call me paranoid - but with the recent announcement on Chains - I fear they<br/>
will announce Bard Mez works fine - case closed.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that&#39;s not the case.  While Chains is seriously less effective than<br/>
it use to be - it&#39;s not worthless.  There are circumstances where it&#39;s an<br/>
okay song.  But past the mid 20&#39;s or so - Lullaby is completely useless.<br/>
<br/>
I tried Pixie Strike recently - and it too did more harm than good.  I guess<br/>
it has some use to try to interrupt casters - but otherwise is also<br/>
useless...<br/>

Ok this REALLY falls into the &quot;whiney player&quot; category.  If I&#39;d known this<br/>
was what you were posting about earlier I wouldn&#39;t have replied to your<br/>
message at all on whineplay.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry my friend but Duping bugs, corpse loss bugs, item poofing bugs etc<br/>
take FAR more priority, to me, than fixing a song that I have learned to do<br/>
without.  I&#39;d FAR rather not be able to mez than to lose all my hard earned<br/>
items to a corpse poofing bug.<br/>
<br/>
Complaining about reality is one thing but they HAVE had some pretty major<br/>
bugs pop up over the past couple weeks that really do take priority over<br/>
fixing things like a secondary resist on our songs.  I&#39;m not saying our<br/>
songs aren&#39;t important to me, far from it, but I really think we need to<br/>
keep things in perspective.<br/>

&gt; You can find a snip of it on www.eqvault.com in the news.<br/>
&gt; I know it was somewhere on the whineplay general forum, but with the<br/>
&gt; servers currently down I can&#39;t connect to it with all the traffic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; [Quote from original post: 4. When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes<br/>
&gt; song), chains (level 23 non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target<br/>
&gt; mes song) be fixed?]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gord&#39;o:<br/>
&gt; Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we&#39;ve had some other<br/>
&gt; things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding<br/>
&gt; chains, it&#39;s working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is<br/>
&gt; that it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m very annoyed by GZ&#39;s comments stating Ester was yanked from our<br/>
problem.<br/>
