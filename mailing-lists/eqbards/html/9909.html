<div id="ygrps-yiv-387489141">Not true - I wish tracking was better in that hills and being near zone<br/>
edges did not mess it all up.  The new Kith makes tracking a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Also you can track static mobs - camp one room and keyy eyes out for other<br/>
spawns (is the cav up?)<br/>
<br/>
Also you can camp room and track roamers to kill between timed spawns.<br/>
(ghoul knight - want?)<br/>
<br/>
Also you can track party members. (help I am lost!)<br/>
<br/>
Tracking is a really good skill to have.<br/>

By the time you get tracking, it&#39;s almost become a moot point <br/>
because 90% of the mobs you will want to attack are static mobs <br/>
*anyway*...  But in anycase, we&#39;ll see how the numbers work out.</div>
