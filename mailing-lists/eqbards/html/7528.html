<div id="ygrps-yiv-444641191"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Your group is going to regret this decision at later levels.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here we are again with the &quot;later level&quot; comments.<br/>
<br/>
To me, anything over 20 *is* the later levels. If I<br/>
don&#39;t like a class by that point, I&#39;m outta there. It<br/>
takes the average player a long time to get to 20 or<br/>
above. Why should they spend months unhappy just to<br/>
hope that one day things might be better? You don&#39;t<br/>
do it in real life given a choice, nor should you have<br/>
to in a game you&#39;re supposed to be playing to HAVE FUN<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
If someone hates the way something works, very rarely<br/>
does &quot;wait, it will get better&quot; offer them any comfort<br/>
or reason to continue.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally speaking, I&#39;ll have given up my bard long<br/>
before I ever come close to that level. It&#39;s already<br/>
starting to lose it&#39;s luster to me at 18. I keep,<br/>
believe it or not, 5 characters active. I&#39;ve got a<br/>
bard, cleric, 2 shamen and a wizard. The bard was<br/>
the main one I used a while ago. See the trend after<br/>
that? All the other players I play have bind. If I<br/>
remember correctly, wasn&#39;t it you John that said (awhile<br/>
ago on this list) that if you started over you&#39;d never<br/>
play a non-binding class again?   (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. I look at the spells that my binding classes<br/>
are going to get at the &quot;later levels&quot; and then I<br/>
look at the songs my non-binding bard is going to get <br/>
at those &quot;later levels&quot; and personally I&#39;m not<br/>
impressed. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve never used<br/>
them before. *shrug* But that combined with not being<br/>
able to bind make the class that less interesting.</div>
