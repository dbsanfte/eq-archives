<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622591913">About the drum graphic...anybody else out there remember the Male Barbarian<br/>
Shield Graphic?  It was left out of the game, like the drum, and Brad<br/>
stated that the patch would be too large to add them.<br/>
<br/>
Poof, then they added the shield.<br/>
<br/>
So, how many male barbarians out there use shields?  Is it more the 100<br/>
percent of Bards who use drums?<br/>
