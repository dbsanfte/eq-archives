<div id="ygrps-yiv-931179287">No kidding...  But considering that the chanter was rarely hasting us,<br/>
cleric wasnt hp buffing us, i saw it very fit that we were playing<br/>
healing/buff songs.  Come to think of it, i think the bards and the wiz were<br/>
the only ones that were doing their job right in the group, took about half<br/>
an hour for the cleric to actually buff us<br/>

Not exclusive, but bards definitly suffer from this the most.  I have no<br/>
idea why all thse people assume they know how to play my 51 bard better than<br/>
I do.  I guess they all play lvl 60 bards as their primaries.  I still run<br/>
into to people that insist my normal haste songs (not the Ervaj ones) stack<br/>
haste effects with enchanters.  &quot;DEWD!!! I tested it MYSELF!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I am in a group where I am lacking any realy good songs to play, I will<br/>
offer to play mana song full time.  Usually this would involve having a<br/>
chanter/shaman and cleric (maybe 2 of the three along with another int<br/>
caster).  It gives me a break from weaving, which is nice.  However I<br/>
explain to them thsat they need to med close to the fights (thus must pull<br/>
close to the medders).  USually they ignore me, so I go back to singing<br/>
other songs (since mana song ain&#39;t hitting the caters anyway).<br/>
<br/>
When someone tells me what songs to play, I ignore the first time they say<br/>
it.  Then say, &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing&quot;, the second time.  If they continue,<br/>
it is dependent on my mood.  I will usually just go back to ignoring them,<br/>
but occasionally I will go on a rant about how I don&#39;t tell them what<br/>
weapons to wield, skills to use, spells to cast, etc...  It also depends on<br/>
their &quot;tone&quot;  If they are trying to be helpful, I will merely explain whY i<br/>
am playing what songs I am singing.  Occasionally someone actually makes a<br/>
good suggestion, and I will swtich my melody...<br/>
