<div id="ygrps-yiv-216934737">I took Double into CT to help him kill some stuff in the CY for some fast<br/>
xp. We got bored and decided to take a peak at the Tae Room.  I told him to<br/>
be careful cuz I noticed that the hulking gorillas conned blue to me at 37.<br/>
He told me &quot;nothing in here sees thru invis...&quot; We watched a party clear the<br/>
room and were standing around after the battle.  Three Fanatics spawned or<br/>
walked thru and immediately agro&#39;d him (and killed him) - although he said<br/>
he conned them indifferent.  <br/>
<br/>
Almost every single time I have been in CT - gating in at wiz port, going in<br/>
thru the maze, going out from 4c - I get seen.  And it&#39;s been with bard<br/>
invis and caster invis as well.  If I was not too busy polishing my Black<br/>
Helocopter, I&#39;d write up a big rant about bard hate extending thru invis ;p<br/>
But from my personal experience, I can&#39;t count on invis to get me past all<br/>
the lizzies in CT.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously -- ymmv<br/>

		It was me that said that the lizzies can&#39;t see invis.  I<br/>
have *never ever*<br/>
		been attacked in Cazic-Thule while I was invis.  This<br/>
assumes, of course,<br/>
		that I&#39;m not already aggro to something when I went invis.<br/>
Most often when<br/>
		I go invis I&#39;ve zoned in /shouted for a group and been told<br/>
to come to TR or<br/>
		Archon.  I fire up Clouding by the zone and run to the<br/>
Archon.  No problems<br/>
		so far, but I&#39;m fighting less there nowadays.<br/>
