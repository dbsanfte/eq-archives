<br/>
<br/>
Having just done it I am ready for this question!<br/>
<br/>
The Hermit, South Karana:<br/>
He is around level 24, sometimes he is easy sometimes pretty tough. (8<br/>
minute spawn). because of his damage shield he is the perfect spawn to<br/>
practice all instrument attack on.  Pull him with Dennons Dischord, fight at<br/>
his front door NOT by the chimney (reason in a sec). If you can pull him<br/>
before he casts his damage shield you can punch him as well, else just use<br/>
instruments. Often he pulls ahead at first but all but once I caught up and<br/>
took him. My combo was DDD,CoD,Largos Binding, Heal.<br/>
<br/>
Plusses:<br/>
Good, consitant exp, 2sp-2pp, often fine steel weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Minuses:<br/>
CONSTANTLY camped, some mornings logging in at 3AM he was camped. My<br/>
stratagy was to keep my Bard camped at his front door and play another<br/>
character until it was free. Looking for Aviaks while you wait is tedium<br/>
defined. On Povar people were very polite and would /tell when they were<br/>
through, I also was offered to share the spawn, which frankly is a drag for<br/>
both, that is until we hit the next minus:<br/>
<br/>
Gnoll, white to red at 25. Spawns outside walls near fireplace, objects to<br/>
your presence. This is why I pull from the side of the house next to the<br/>
wall door and take him to the houses front door to fight. I have had him<br/>
spawn in the middle of a fight and attack an enchanter sitting in the wagon<br/>
who mezzed and gated. Even when the mez wore off he ignore me while I<br/>
finished the hermit. Your milage may vary.<br/>
<br/>
misc:<br/>
Sell weapons at the centaur village, do the winds of Karana quest while you<br/>
wait for him to open up. Doing the quest will give you lots of practice<br/>
asking Teir&#39;Dal necromancers if you can talk to the bards before they kill<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Crag Spiders, East Karana:<br/>
More excitement, longer downtime. Hunt the mountain to your left as you exit<br/>
the ramp.<br/>
<br/>
Also East Karana will have some Undead Reavers and even doggies that give<br/>
exp at times.<br/>
<br/>
Pluses:<br/>
On Povar it&#39;s a really friendly zone with lots of comraderie. Jerks usually<br/>
only passing through to South Karana.<br/>
<br/>
Minuses:<br/>
A Broon droon Proon being kited while you are AFK.<br/>
<br/>
Aviaks, Lake Rathetear.<br/>
Look around for one of the lesser camped bird houses.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure there is lots more, but that is a start, good luck!<br/>
