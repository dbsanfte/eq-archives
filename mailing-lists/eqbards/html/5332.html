<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090362162"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of armour I can<br/>
&gt;get that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives, or<br/>
&gt;somewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can even go<br/>
&gt;out and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income if cheap<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would suggest a bloodstained tunic, lizzie scale mantle and cloack, and<br/>
blackend armor for the rest.  Looks great and if weight is an issue it will<br/>
help alot. Yes the armor is NICE to have..I persoanlly wear a combo of<br/>
charred plate and bronze right now, but i have so many strength enhancers it<br/>
isnt even funny! As a young bard the above items will be abit above your<br/>
level for now..but well within the grasp of a rich bard..so get your mage to<br/>
support you (LOL). Good luck to you Melaniel. May your songs be well<br/>
recieved!<br/>
