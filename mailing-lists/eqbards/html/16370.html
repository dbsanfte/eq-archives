Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a 21st lvl bard and have been working with the song/instrument attack.<br/>
 So far it has been working very well but I do have some questions.   These<br/>
questions stem from looking at the Bard Song Calculator 8)<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the output it says that at level 21 my songs do the following:<br/>
<br/>
CoD w/intr 14dam x 3 ticks = 42<br/>
       wo/intr 3dam x 3 ticks = 9<br/>
<br/>
DDD  w/intr 19dam x 3 ticks = 57<br/>
        wo/intr 5dam x 3 ticks = 15<br/>
<br/>
Okay, when I start a song and then stop the song it will pulse for 3 ticks<br/>
from what I have read on this board. <br/>
<br/>
1)  If I change instruments after stopping the song do I still get the<br/>
instrument effect during the 3 ticks ??  ie with DDD do I do 19+19+19 or<br/>
will it do 19+5+5.<br/>
<br/>
A: 19x3<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2)  Do creatures get resist attempts on each tick or do they only get the<br/>
resist attempt on the first pulse?  reasoning behind this is that at times<br/>
my damage seems to go to nil even though I am not being resisted as far as<br/>
I can see.<br/>
<br/>
A: Dot&#39;s are All or Nothing. If they fail the initial check they will take<br/>
full damage.<br/>
<br/>
3)  How long is a tick?  Is it 3 seconds or is it 6 seconds?<br/>
<br/>
A: 6 seconds<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for you time and the great discussions held on this list.<br/>
