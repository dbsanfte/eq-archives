<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058670302"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;This is one of many complaints made by high level bards . . . saying that<br/>
&gt;they are not finding groups, and are not accepted at high levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pardon my audacity, but this complaint seems a little but premature, and to<br/>
&gt;us &quot;lower&quot; level people, seems kind of silly. I play EQ a LOT, and I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;bad at it either. Since release my character has made it to Level 18. If<br/>
&gt;you are in the low 30&#39;s as you say, then you must play EQ obsessively, for<br/>
&gt;that level seems so far away to many of us we are not even thinking about<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aye, you are right.  I happened into a group of power-gamers when I was lvl<br/>
4 (several were friends of mine from P4) and I&#39;ve been playing &quot;catch up&quot;<br/>
every since.  In order to try to stay with (or anywhere near) the levels of<br/>
those I used to game with heavily, I must play EQ almost every waking moment<br/>
that I am not at work.  But they are the only people I know in the game.<br/>
*shrug*<br/>
<br/>
OTOH however, it doesn&#39;t take all that much effort to get to high levels<br/>
quickly IF you know where things are, which mobs to hunt at which level, and<br/>
are in a group with good players and learn to augment their style of play.<br/>
This last point is really the telling one for bards, although it is<br/>
important to everyone.  When I join a group I always am cautious at first.<br/>
I watch how they react in melee.  How does the healer do his thing? Is he a<br/>
melee-oriented healer, or is he a stand back and heal person?  Is it a<br/>
fetch-and-retrieve group or a wander aimlessly group?<br/>
If it&#39;s a fetch group, does the fetch wait until current melee is over<br/>
before going for next fetch or does he go when existing mob is down to 20%?<br/>
How effective are the casters?  Do they dump their mana in rapid fire<br/>
succession or do they hold back and go for killing nuke? What is the mob<br/>
we&#39;re hunting, and what other mobs might turn up?<br/>
<br/>
After I determine all of that, THEN I make my final song selection, memming<br/>
different songs if necessary.  Do this, and you will be one of the best<br/>
bards on your server.  Insist on sticking with your personal favorite song,<br/>
and you&#39;ll have dead group members.  I recall one bard who used to ALWAYS<br/>
use charm song.  Unfortunately, he&#39;d do /assist first, so the entire group<br/>
would have to retarget.<br/>
<br/>
Getting back to leveling speed, you can level quickly, all you need is one<br/>
person in your regular group who knows where to go for max eeps.  One of my<br/>
former groupmembers quit his 30th lvl cleric and started over.  In 3 days he<br/>
was lvl 12.  He made a level a day for next 3 days.  Do I recommend playing<br/>
that way?  No way.  While I enjoy being within spitting distance of the top<br/>
bard on my server, I wish I&#39;d done differently now.  I&#39;ve missed out on a<br/>
lot of fun in the chase for levels.  =(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So relax and wait a bit for us normal people to catch up to you. Soon level<br/>
&gt;30 players will be just as common as level 20 players, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;have more luck. It seems to me that you should be happy, not sad, about<br/>
&gt;your incredible sucess with the game. And to us down here in the mere<br/>
&gt;teens, the complaint seems amusing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you get to a certain level, and you&#39;re on the leading edge of &quot;the<br/>
pack&quot;, you have to stay in front or get trampled.  When I first started<br/>
doing Thule, we had our choice of what we wanted to do.  Almost no one was<br/>
there.  10-15 players in the zone at most.  Now, 50-70 players in the zone<br/>
is common, and everyone is fighting over the prime hunting areas.  That&#39;s<br/>
why I want to stay on the front edge.... I don&#39;t like having to compete with<br/>
so many people for a decent chance for a few eeps.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have never heard of groups where spots are &quot;reserved&quot; or &quot;permanent&quot; or<br/>
&gt;&quot;temporary&quot;. Again, I think this is something unique to high level<br/>
&gt;powergamers. It sounds amazingly rude to me. To be &quot;offered&quot; spots as if<br/>
&gt;they were job offers . . . wow, I feel for you, that ridiculous. It sounds<br/>
&gt;like high school all over again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re quite right.  But on the other hand, imagine being at a level where<br/>
anything you can solo gives you no experience.  You MUST group to do<br/>
anything.  Now imagine sitting in a dungeon area for hours, waiting for a<br/>
chance to get in a group.  I once sat for 2 hours waiting for a &quot;guy who&#39;s<br/>
about to leave&quot; to actually leave.  (turned out he did leave, spot given to<br/>
someone else, another quit, spot filled, and I got the 3d opening)  A friend<br/>
of mine who got fed up with EQ once sat for 6 hours after being told he had<br/>
the &quot;next opening&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You get to know which group leaders are the best.  Which are most<br/>
successful? Which have best survival rate? Which is least likely to dump<br/>
trains on people nearby?  Which leader knows how to control a spawn? Which<br/>
people know which items are on what mobs?  And you try to get in those<br/>
groups.  When you&#39;re in &quot;the pack&quot; (i.e., where most players are at<br/>
level-wise), you may have 50-100 group leaders who are good to be with.<br/>
When you&#39;re on the front edge of the pack, you have 3-4 good leaders and<br/>
competition is keen to get into their groups, because you know it would be<br/>
VERY worth your while.<br/>
