at level 60?  I&#39;ve never even seen someone who knew<br/>
the formula that figures out the effects.  Not saying<br/>
it is wrong either, but heck I figure John would know<br/>
the formula if anyone, and it looks like he doesn&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; From Eqcaster.<br/>
&gt; At level 23 the slow down effect is 53%<br/>
&gt; At level 60 the slow down effect is 90%<br/>
&gt; Decrease Atk spd by 16% at lvl 23 and at lvl 60 by<br/>
&gt; 35%<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course these values could be wrong but I doubt<br/>
&gt; they are.<br/>
