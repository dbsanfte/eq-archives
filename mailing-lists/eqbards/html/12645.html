<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613473056">at the risk of Kit becoming nauseous, i spent 19 to 38 all in cazic =)<br/>
<br/>
but i was rushing.  with my new character i like to go places i haven&#39;t<br/>
before.  where i am now is Paw.  the most i have ever seen is 24 ppl, and<br/>
the average is 2 groups max.  its great exp for 32 to 35 in the front rooms.<br/>
and its new to me, i never fought there before the change or in beta.<br/>

&gt; Heh heh, Brave Heart Madagan.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m 28 days old and only 21st level.  The problem is, <br/>
&gt; leveling generally is<br/>
&gt; boring.  I get bored trying to stay in one place for long, <br/>
&gt; much less at one<br/>
&gt; camp.  Whenever I see that someone stayed in the Highkeep <br/>
&gt; basement for 3<br/>
&gt; levels or is Cazic for 5 levels, I get that sick feeling in <br/>
&gt; the pit of my<br/>
&gt; stomach.  If that&#39;s what it takes to level beyond 25 I never <br/>
&gt; will.  Doing<br/>
&gt; those things is not fun for me in the least, and if the game <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t fun I<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t play, pure and simple.<br/>
