<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640644813">It really depends on your bard.  are you hurting for strength?  the 6ac by itself<br/>
is really negligible and you won&#39;t notice the difference.  that dar knight in sebilis<br/>
won&#39;t all of a sudden start hitting you for 90 instead of 110, for example, heh.<br/>
but the singing steel will weigh more, so if you have a low base strength, you may<br/>
not be able to go full singing steel.  i put all my spare points in the beginning into<br/>
strength because i knew in the teens/20&#39;s i&#39;d need it for bronze armor.  lambent and<br/>
imbrued isn&#39;t too heavy, but then singing steel is pretty weighty again.  so it worked<br/>
out pretty good.  i&#39;ve got full singing steel except for hero bracer and ebbp and i run<br/>
into weight problems every now and then even with an abukar box.<br/>
<br/>
on the other hand, 2k is just plat, and easily replaceable.  just go farm unrest<br/>
or cazic or lower guk for fine steel weapons.<br/>

&gt;weekend.  The AC for the SS is 6 better than SotA, but the SotA provide STR<br/>
&gt;and CHR bonuses while the SS has no stat bonuses.  I have been waiting until<br/>
&gt;I dinged 50 before I started to hunt in Sebilis.  Well I dinged 50 this<br/>
&gt;weekend so plan to start going there soon.  Now I have heard that SS arms<br/>
&gt;are not that hard to acquire in Seb.  So I am debating if I should buy the<br/>
&gt;SS arms now or wait until I can loot them for myself.  The 2K will clean me<br/>
&gt;out so would prefer to loot them instead of buying them.  But if they are<br/>
&gt;harder to acquire than what I was told, then I may decide to fork out the<br/>
&gt;cash.  For those of you with a lot of experience fighting in Seb, would like<br/>
&gt;to hear what you have to say.<br/>
