&gt; I have a theory about Sonorous Coulding failing. It has failed for me a<br/>
&gt; few times (although I have NEVER been attacked my any lizard in CT :). I<br/>
&gt; noticed (and posted) my success in Unrest a few days ago. My only<br/>
&gt; failure was when a mob spawned right near me and immediately attacked.<br/>
&gt; Then today I read a post from someone who was in CT and looking at the<br/>
&gt; spawns in the Throne Room, they stated that 2 mobs walked in OR spawned<br/>
&gt; and saw thru their invis.<br/>

&gt; It appears that sonorous clouding works on mobs that are in the zone<br/>
&gt; when it pulses, but mobs who spawn and have not had a &quot;dose&quot; (pulse) of<br/>
&gt; it can see thru it. Just ancedotal evidence so far, if anyone can add to<br/>
&gt; this, please do so.<br/>

Granted I wasn&#39;t checking when the song pulsed, so I can&#39;t<br/>
really refute your second hypothesis.  But I actually think it<br/>
works the opposite way.  On several occasions, I&#39;ve had a mob<br/>
spawn next to me while I was fully visible, and I&#39;ve managed<br/>
to run a safe distance away without aggroing it.  I think<br/>
mobs are inactive for a few seconds when they first spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Another place you&#39;ll notice this &quot;mobs /con indifferent while<br/>
invisible but attack you anyway&quot; effect is on the live side of<br/>
Lower Guk.  The minotaurs seem to be particularly good at it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pay no heed to that message.  I&#39;ve gotten it close to a<br/>
hundred times, and I&#39;ve only become visible after it once.  <br/>
OTOH, there have been several dozen times when I&#39;ve suddenly<br/>
become visible without the message (after the message was put<br/>
in).  I really think they goofed and the message makes it<br/>
impossible for bards to become visible, but we do occasionally<br/>
become visible due to lag and PL.<br/>
