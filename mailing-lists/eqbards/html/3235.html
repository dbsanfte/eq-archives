<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833785525">I can&#39;t help but think of this in viloin terms.<br/>
<br/>
A description for those that don&#39;t know.  A violin can normally<br/>
just play one note at a time.  However, if you get *very* good<br/>
with your fingers you can play two notes at a time.  There is a <br/>
story about Nicolo Paganini (an amazing 1782-1840 violinist) that <br/>
he once wrote a love ballad for a violin duet, however could not <br/>
find a partner to perform the other part.  So he just played both <br/>
parts on the same violin at once!  (sounds almost impossible to me!)  <br/>
It is possible for virtuoso players to play three, and rarely  <br/>
(songs must have special characteristics) four notes at once.  More<br/>
than four is not possible, since at that point your out of strings!<br/>
<br/>
Since the progression of 2 for a professional, 3-4 for virtuoso<br/>
matches exactly ... I think of the ability to play multiple songs<br/>
in these terms.<br/>
<br/>
Two-at-once:<br/>
double-stop<br/>
<br/>
Three-at-once:<br/>
triple-stop<br/>
<br/>
etc...<br/>
<br/>
Since my daughter is the violinist and I play woodwinds (which don&#39;t have<br/>
this technique), I couldn&#39;t help but think when my Bard first managed to <br/>
keep two songs up that:<br/>
<br/>
Ha! This woodwind player can finally double-stop!<br/>
