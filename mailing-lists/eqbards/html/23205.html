<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442044007">They fixed slow spells a couple of months ago.  Better slows will not<br/>
overwrite weaker slows.  That is why you got the wore off message.  After it<br/>
has been slowed you can still use cessation for damage, but the slow portion<br/>
will have no effect.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like some clarification on how our slow songs stack with<br/>
&gt; enchanter/shaman slows.  This past weekend I was grouped with <br/>
&gt; an enchanter.<br/>
&gt; I had Chords of Cessation memmed but was not singing it until <br/>
&gt; the enchanter<br/>
&gt; slowed the mob.  During one fight the enchanter was late <br/>
&gt; slowing the mob so<br/>
&gt; I went ahead and used Cessation.  After my song went into effect, the<br/>
&gt; enchanter cast his slow spell.  I got a message saying the my <br/>
&gt; Cessation song<br/>
&gt; wore off immediately followed by the message that the <br/>
&gt; enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>
&gt; stuck.  I got the Cessation effect &quot;wore off&quot; message before <br/>
&gt; the song&#39;s<br/>
&gt; normal duration passed.  So it appeared that the enchanter&#39;s <br/>
&gt; slow spell<br/>
&gt; overwrote Cessation.  So what I am wondering is if the <br/>
&gt; enchanter slow spell<br/>
&gt; actually negated Cessation or if the enchanter&#39;s slow message <br/>
&gt; was an error<br/>
&gt; and his slow did not stick?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am suprised no one else has noticed this yet, but over the weekend i<br/>
&gt; discovered (and had it confirmed and tested by another high <br/>
&gt; level bard) that<br/>
&gt; the lvl 51 chains song no longer overwrites snare (we know it doesnt<br/>
&gt; overwrite root, but snare was a suprise)!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also tested the chains song with the Enchanter Slow line, and the<br/>
&gt; enchanter slow overwrites the lvl51 song, but not the other <br/>
&gt; way around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What this boils down to (from my observations of the lvl 51 song):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *	We can now chain a mob to snare a mob if in doubt that <br/>
&gt; it is snared<br/>
&gt; or rooted<br/>
&gt; *	We can now chain a mob to slow the mob, without fear of <br/>
&gt; canceling<br/>
&gt; snare<br/>
&gt; *	We can now chain a mob to slow the mob, without the <br/>
&gt; fear of blocking<br/>
&gt; an Enchanter slow<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I have not tested:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *	Other versions of our chains (the lvl 23 and lvl 54 aoe <br/>
&gt; song) and<br/>
&gt; slow songs (lvl 21 aoe) against snare or slow<br/>
&gt; *	Any of the songs against the Shaman slow series<br/>
&gt; *	All of my snare tests were done against low-level druid <br/>
&gt; snare.  I<br/>
&gt; did not test any of the songs against the higher level Ensnare.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It has always been my understanding that our slowing effects <br/>
&gt; stack with<br/>
&gt; Enchanter or Shaman slowing effects (but previous to the last <br/>
&gt; patch would<br/>
&gt; block them if our song was up on the mob when the spell was <br/>
&gt; cast).  If my<br/>
&gt; above testing proves to be true, this means that we are <br/>
&gt; &quot;value added&quot; to<br/>
&gt; enchanters and shaman both now, at least from a mana and <br/>
&gt; slowing standpoint!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I look forward to seeing if you guys get similiar results!<br/>
