be, at least, not very often.  The message boards are filled with rants of<br/>
&quot;I went to so and so dungeon, and right before I killed this monster, some<br/>
level 40 invisible magician ran by us and stole my kill&quot;.  Do you really<br/>
want your second character, or your friends, to go through the same system<br/>
of camping hours on end and dealing with kill stealers that you did?<br/>
	It&#39;s something ingrained in human nature to try and make the lives<br/>
of our family and friends easier, to save them the hardships that we had<br/>
to go through.  To me, the &quot;fun&quot; in everquest is the interaction between<br/>
you and your friends, going in a group to kill monsters to learn new<br/>
skills and new spells.  Going through a dungeon to get items is nice and<br/>
all, but when the items in question are ones in which you have to deal<br/>
with people who&#39;s sole purpose seem to deprive other people of their fun,<br/>
by farming the items for ebay, or kill stealing them items for themselves,<br/>
I for one wouldn&#39;t want to go through that experience any more than I have<br/>
to, nor would I want to put anyone else through it.<br/>
