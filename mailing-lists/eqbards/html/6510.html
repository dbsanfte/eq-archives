<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519960851">I agree in one sense Galtin (welcome back by the way ;-) because I hate the<br/>
fact that quest items are no drop, it is irritating. Actually, I hate the<br/>
whole NO DROP thing altogether and wish there was a better way to handle the<br/>
issues it was stuck in against, but that is neither here nor there I<br/>
suppose.<br/>
<br/>
My point is this:<br/>
<br/>
Player creates a Warrior, raises him to level 3, Kills as many koalindl fish<br/>
as he can before he is killed (by Mr. Paladin), comes back, loots<br/>
corpse...runs out into a remote area somewhere (how about a rooftop in<br/>
Freeport) drops the items, logs out, logs back in immediately with his main<br/>
character who was logged out in the same secret place, picks up the<br/>
items...ta da!<br/>
<br/>
Hence the absurd need for NO DROP.  Also NO TRADE can be circumvented<br/>
without NO DROP in place by just dropping an item at the feet of another<br/>
player rather than using the trade window - requires more trust for a big<br/>
transaction, but makes NO TRADE useless without NO DROP.  Some items are<br/>
currently NO DROP but tradable, like some of the keys you pick up...try to<br/>
drop one on the ground...no dice...but you can put it in the bank, sell it<br/>
to a merchant or give it to another player. I am thinking in specific of<br/>
keys I have picked up in Unrest although I am sure there are others as well.<br/>
<br/>
I wandered around with a weight 2 bloody ogre head in my backpack for 3<br/>
weeks hoping to catch Zarchoomi and finally gave up and destroyed the head.<br/>
I feel the NO DROP policy hurts players who play the game fairly just to<br/>
force the people who do not play fairly to play by the &quot;rules&quot;.  Sigh, I<br/>
feel I&#39;m getting closer and closer to a KABONG so I&#39;d better shut up.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think changing quest items to NO DROP is a step in the <br/>
&gt; right direction.<br/>
&gt; Case in point is the Exotic Drinks/Glowing Stein quest.  When <br/>
&gt; the quest was<br/>
&gt; finally fixed a couple months back, people were creating 1st <br/>
&gt; level mule<br/>
&gt; characters to kill the koalindl fish at the Temple of Life in <br/>
&gt; Qeynos.  This<br/>
&gt; allowed them to avoid the major faction hit with their main <br/>
&gt; character.  The<br/>
&gt; mule character then gave the fish to the main character ( I <br/>
&gt; admit I did this<br/>
&gt; but only because my faction got screwed earlier by trying to <br/>
&gt; complete the<br/>
&gt; quest legitimately before it got fixed).  To complete the <br/>
&gt; quest now, the<br/>
&gt; same person has to acquire all the quest components.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the best way Verant could handle this is to make <br/>
&gt; quest components NO<br/>
&gt; TRADE and keep magic items NO DROP.  That way, you could put quest<br/>
&gt; components in the bank until you got them all and eliminates <br/>
&gt; using mule<br/>
&gt; characters to collect the items.  This would also allow <br/>
&gt; Verant to start<br/>
&gt; giving better rewards for quests because it ensures that the player<br/>
&gt; completes all the necessary steps and earn the reward.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Another thing, although not specifically bard related <br/>
&gt; except in that bards<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably do more quests than anyone else simply because <br/>
&gt; they can, is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; constant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I <br/>
&gt; went to the bank<br/>
&gt; &gt; last nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 <br/>
&gt; containers from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bank<br/>
&gt; &gt; because if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I <br/>
&gt; would have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; carry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does <br/>
&gt; Verant think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; solution to everything is to make an item no drop.  <br/>
&gt; Bizzarely the Bozemite<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the <br/>
&gt; use for is now No<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires <br/>
&gt; considerable<br/>
&gt; &gt; faction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go <br/>
&gt; figure.  Why should<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across <br/>
&gt; Norrath to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put <br/>
&gt; it in the bank<br/>
&gt; &gt; while searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness <br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; weigh<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10 lbs.<br/>
