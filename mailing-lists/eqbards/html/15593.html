I hate people who do stuff like that!  I wish I was on your server to help<br/>
you.  The best thing to do and it will help stop him from doing it to<br/>
someone else is /petition a GM and talk to them.  Tell them your story and<br/>
the guys char name.  Keep at it until you get satisfaction and take it to<br/>
your server&#39;s head GM if need be.  They (head GM) can restore you in a<br/>
couple ways.  They can get your stuff back from a set save point prior to<br/>
your &#39;incident.&#39;  Please please talk to your Guide and GM staff and help<br/>
stop this guy from pulling this crap on the next person.<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well I just wanted to tell you a little tale so that you can all remember<br/>
&gt; not to make my mistakes.  Last night, I made the mistake of consenting<br/>
&gt; someone to drag Tani&#39;s corpse out of the Scryer room in Guk.  Well, long<br/>
&gt; story short, all my armor and weapons were stolen (punishment for<br/>
twinking,<br/>
&gt; heh) by this guy. </span></blockquote></div>
