Madagan, Woodelf Bard of 29 songs - Veeshan server.<br/>

ROSHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
WELCOME!<br/>
<br/>
Innoruuk Bards RULE!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s bugged - fix one thing break several others - SOP! I sent in a<br/>
nasty feedback - along those lines.  Grrr!  I think everyone else is doing<br/>
the same!  Ros - read the archives here and find the response we got from<br/>
GZ<br/>
(arch mage guy) to a letter we compiled about a whole bunch of bard things.<br/>
So, although we rant and rave like mad - occasionally we send in a<br/>
reasonable letter and eventually get a decent response.<br/>
<br/>
See ya soon!<br/>

          Subject:  [eqbards] Broken Song<br/>
<br/>
          Greetings,<br/>
          first allow me to introduce myself.  I am new to this list,<br/>
but not a new bard nor a new player to Everquest.  I currently have a 31st<br/>
level Bard on Innoruuk, Rosha.  I have been playing him since March 26th,<br/>
just not in a hurry to level.<br/>
<br/>
          Anyway, with the latest patch, I have noticed a problem with<br/>
the level 31 song, the levitate one.  Now when I play it, it starts, I<br/>
rise,<br/>
I get the message I feel as if I am about to fall, followed by You are<br/>
already floating.  This repeats for 2 cycles.  Immediately after the 3rd<br/>
cycle of the song, I then fall to the ground, the icon disappears.  On the<br/>
next cycle, it all repeats.  It does this even if twisting, so it seems to<br/>
me that it now only allows continuos levitation for two song pulses.  I did<br/>
just acquire this song, so I don&#39;t profess to be an expert, however, it did<br/>
not function like this prior to the patch.  Just a word of caution using<br/>
this song now, and be on the lookout for other changes!!<br/>
<br/>
