You may want to consider logging in and only playing<br/>
for an hour or two. I know at the higher levels, list<br/>
wait times stretch much longer than the hour or two<br/>
that you are playing, but atleast you can hop in and<br/>
say hi. Maybe help acouple of people out ect.<br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, please keep your web site updated. I<br/>
check your site ever day and find the information<br/>
invaulable. I wish you the best and please do not be a<br/>
stranger.<br/>

   First of all, I&#39;m still around, I read you all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; everyday. =D<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I haven&#39;t played Everquest in about 2 weeks now.<br/>
&gt;  I may not<br/>
&gt; &gt;   play Everquest again.  In short, the game was<br/>
&gt; taking away time<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I needed to spend working and most importantly<br/>
&gt; taking care of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   my girlfriend.  For almost 14 months (since beta<br/>
&gt; 3) she has<br/>
&gt; &gt;   endured 6-8 hour sessions of EQ on a daily<br/>
&gt; basis.  Clearly,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the game came before she did in all cases.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Everquest wasn&#39;t that great either, I know I<br/>
&gt; complained about<br/>
&gt; &gt;   it often, but I&#39;d keep coming back for the<br/>
&gt; people when I could<br/>
&gt; &gt;   have turned and looked 5 feet beside me and<br/>
&gt; spent time with<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that one person who counted.  Everquest/Verant<br/>
&gt; are full of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   shortcomings and I kept hoping that things would<br/>
&gt; finally get<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;work properly&#39; - but that was just a<br/>
&gt; dream.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I want to play again, just not now.  Things are<br/>
&gt; going very well<br/>
&gt; &gt;   right now and I don&#39;t want to bring back the<br/>
&gt; frustration that EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt;   caused me.  I&#39;ll read the posts here where<br/>
&gt; relevant, but I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;   post much.  I&#39;ve got big work projects demanding<br/>
&gt; more and more<br/>
&gt; &gt;   time.  I&#39;ve also got a kitten and a beautiful<br/>
&gt; girlfriend demanding<br/>
&gt; &gt;   more time as well.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; return and play the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   length of time I once played.  But I hope to<br/>
&gt; return soon, maybe in<br/>
&gt; &gt;   a few more weeks.<br/>
