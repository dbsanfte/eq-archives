Wonder if they will take a survey when you move characters so we can see<br/>
graphs and charts about how many moved to escape bad reputations, how many<br/>
are running from the guild from whom they ninja&#39;d uber-gear, and how many<br/>
are moving because of a broken relationship caused by too much EQ.  Kinda<br/>
funny when you think about it :)<br/>

&gt; Well, this is a bit different Talies.  Imagine you are a live together<br/>
&gt; couple that have parted ways, now you can actually keep your <br/>
&gt; character when<br/>
&gt; you split.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Seems to me that with what they are charging - it&#39;s going to <br/>

&gt; &gt;center&quot; for Verant.  I&#39;m concerned that Bards will be the <br/>
&gt; type of character<br/>
&gt; &gt;where we&#39;ll see significant E-Bay&#39;ers.  I expect to see a <br/>
&gt; lot of bards in<br/>
&gt; SS<br/>
&gt; &gt;and POG armor with no idea how the songs work - let alone twisting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t really understand the mentality.  I know I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; alone in feeling<br/>
&gt; &gt;the early levels could be among the most fun - and learning <br/>
&gt; the class was a<br/>
&gt; &gt;blast.  I really enjoy getting tells from people who&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; found me randomly<br/>
&gt; &gt;with esoteric questions about being a bard - and stuff <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s rarely used<br/>
&gt; &gt;(had one recently about the Identify Magic song).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone from DragonRealms remember the stink made when they announced <br/>
&gt; platinum service?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *grumbles*<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t sub to that, and I won&#39;t sub to it here.  I think it&#39;s a <br/>
&gt; disgusting practice, to separate people based on economics.<br/>
