<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628278127">offhand I would say you are a half elf.  can&#39;t wear elf-sized armor that&#39;s sold in Kelethin.  No worries tho -- you can buy armor from players or maybe trade something for it.  tailoring skill is an option too.  or you can go to FP later and buy.  I&#39;d stay in kelethin tho.  Orc hill totally rocks thru 7th lvl and crushbone is good xp too, especially if you do the belt/shoulderpad quests.<br/>

sometimes find things like sleeves or shoes or scarves on corpses but <br/>
when i try and wear the items it says in red letters  &quot;your <br/>
race/class/diety (etc...)&quot; and it won&#39;t let me use the items.  I also <br/>
tried to buy a training tunic, same message.  The item (tunic or some <br/>
such) that i got when i first talked to the guildmsater is gone <br/>
because i died a bunch of times and couldnt find my corpse (now i <br/>
have locating lyric which is just awesome)  So my question is,  What <br/>
armor *Can* I wear?  I am a Half-Elf Quelious Bard is that <br/>
restricting me somehow?  Should I learn how to sew and make my own <br/>
stuff?  Is it the fact that I am still below level 5?  <br/>
<br/>
Also I have kept giving spiderling silk to the guildmaster and every <br/>
so often i get a gold piece, some experience and a drum.  I have 4 <br/>
drums now do I need to keep them or should i just keep 1 of them?  <br/>
Sorry if I&#39;m asking silly questions, but that&#39;s what newbies like me <br/>
are for aint it?  :)<br/>
<br/>
that is all...<br/>
