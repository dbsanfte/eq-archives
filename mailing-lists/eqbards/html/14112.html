&gt;<br/>
&gt;		So my question is this... what do I do?  I know in the<br/>
&gt;future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more clear rules<br/>
&gt;set up.  Does this happen on other servers?  Has this happened to any of<br/>
&gt;you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On all big hunts I have been on there is a designated looter in each group, <br/>
usually the group leader.  This person is responsible for looting the corpse <br/>
if the group gets the kill as soon as feasible.  If the group leader dies <br/>
before the battle ends then someone in the group, usually at the direction <br/>
of the group leader, will loot and report.<br/>
<br/>
One way to tell if a corpse has been ninja looted is if it gives no coin.  <br/>
As, to the best of my knowledge, mobs will always drop some coin, except of <br/>
course newbie mobs.<br/>
