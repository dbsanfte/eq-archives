<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381446298">So what is Diku code?  First time I&#39;ve ever heard that term thrown out in<br/>
regards to Everquest.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; No, this wouldn&#39;t be coded in this way.  EverQuest, for all the wondrous<br/>
&gt; claims of its development team, is 99% Diku code from everything I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; able to tell (Right down to how emotes are coded)  They didn&#39;t even bother<br/>
&gt; to change some of the methods for commands...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The basic &quot;Structure&quot; of the game is much much different but the combat<br/>
&gt; engine behind everything looks/feels and sounds VERY close to original<br/>
&gt; Diku<br/>
&gt; code.  Experience in Diku code was very linear in progression and<br/>
&gt; numerically based.  What little information I&#39;ve been able to wheedle out<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; friends  up at Verant leads me to believe this is still the case (they<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; use Mob #&#39;s to load NPC&#39;s etc still, just like in DIKU).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which means that A) They&#39;ve tinkered with the original Diku experience<br/>
&gt; tables (NEEDED!) and B) The Hell levels and the H+1 levels are either<br/>
&gt; extremely intentional or some collosolly bad coding.  I&#39;d personally<br/>
&gt; support<br/>
&gt; either opinion equally.  I&#39;m not that impressed with Verant&#39;s programming<br/>
&gt; prowess.<br/>
