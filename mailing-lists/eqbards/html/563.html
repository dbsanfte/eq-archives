<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474589942">As to languages. Other than the obvious of spending those much cherished<br/>
skill points when you gain a level, is there any other way to raise<br/>
something? I have Gnoll right now, and its at a pretty low level, like 12 I<br/>
think, and since I dont see myself having any sort of conversations with<br/>
Fippy Darkpaw, or any others of his kind, how would this be raised?</div>
