<b>Subject:</b> RE: Gypsy Lute? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337219924">Great.  I just borrowed 176P to get this Gypsy princess Lute hoping I might<br/>
have a chance to get this breastplate.  Now I am in debt, no closer to the<br/>
breast plate, and have a useless Lute.  Sometimes you just have to laugh at<br/>
your own bad luck.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I guess it does have some role play possibilities, maybe someone<br/>
who happens to stay and listen to a song im singing, I mean between people<br/>
asking me for things and casting buffs/summons, might inspect me and go<br/>
&quot;Wow, cool Lute, do anything?&quot; At which point Ill reply &quot;No&quot; and remember<br/>
the 176P I wasted and am still paying back.  It&#39;s like Beta software, I<br/>
should have remembered to wait until the quest items were clearly defined by<br/>
other peoples failures.<br/>
