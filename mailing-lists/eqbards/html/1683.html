<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523650752"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;         Can&#39;t agree with you more on using the /assist command.  However, I<br/>
&gt; have come to the conclusion that the majority of people playing this game<br/>
&gt; are not aware of the utility of the /assist command.  I always request<br/>
&gt; people in my group to use the /assist command before we start engaging<br/>
&gt; enemies.  Almost everytime I do that someone comes back and asks &quot;What is<br/>
&gt; the /assist command? It isn&#39;t on the Socials menu.&quot;   After I tell them what<br/>
&gt; it does, generally their next response is &quot;Cool, I didn&#39;t know you could do<br/>
&gt; that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The people in my party use /assist all the time, and we&#39;ve found it to be very<br/>
very buggy.  For some reason, /assist will often have them or their pets attack<br/>
completely different mobs, and we don&#39;t know why.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had similar experiences?<br/>
