<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042586666"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Just what is the range of a Screech?  I just got it and <br/>
&gt;was testing it on goblins in Misty and Beholder, and it <br/>
&gt;seems to me that it only works on stuff very close to <br/>
&gt;immediate melee range.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It works only in melee range.  And this is where you want<br/>
it to work because it will offer you two things:<br/>
<br/>
1) Monsters chasing you in melee range will be feared away.<br/>
   Thus you can escape certain death and not agro an entire<br/>
   room with AE fear since it only hits those few things in <br/>
   range to attack you.<br/>
<br/>
2) Allows you to reverse kite, for which you must be in melee<br/>
   range to make effective back attacks as the monster flees.<br/>
