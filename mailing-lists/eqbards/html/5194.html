<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028236771">As I said, my skills are all at or above 190, and approaching 200. My<br/>
regrets that your Brass skills are poor, perhaps a little practice is in<br/>
order. I have tested this and as I said several times I am missing notes on<br/>
songs I NEVER missed notes on before. I use Denons constantly, I dont know<br/>
too many Bards who dont, its an extremely effective DoT even sung, comparing<br/>
to Bellow. I havent had a problem starting this song since I was level 20.<br/>
Now all of a sudden last night it wouldnt fire once, and I tried a total of<br/>
maybe 30 times before I became frustrated and deleted it from memory. Now I<br/>
didnt even have a problem before last night with this song, any more than<br/>
any of the others with this mossed note phenomenom. So here I am all my<br/>
skills about to reach their skillcap, basically I have reached the peak of a<br/>
Bards skill carreer, and I can even consider missing a note? On a song that<br/>
I have been singing flawlessly for 15 levels? Your joking right? I mean the<br/>
very premise of having high skills is what awful,very bad, bad, poor,<br/>
average, good, very good, and Master. I am almost double the Master skill<br/>
level! So maybe its server based, or maybe some peoples skills were always<br/>
poor so they didnt notice any difference. What I am saying is I never had<br/>
this problem till the patch 2 weeks ago when they said they fixed mised<br/>
notes on high level songs. Or as I said at the time &quot;Dumbing down the Bard&quot;<br/>
so those too lazy to practice skills like Brass could actually get the songs<br/>
to fire.<br/>

And you know what?  Not to sound rude, but I&#39;m getting tired of people<br/>
saying<br/>
that there IS a bug without doing tests about it.  Everyone here who has sat<br/>
down and started a variety of songs and counted missed notes seems to have<br/>
normal failure rates, yet you&#39;re accusing everyone of &quot;black helicopter<br/>
crap&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I tested last night with my level 30 song, which I had never even played<br/>
before<br/>
(I just levelled), and I missed 6 notes in 60 tries.  That&#39;s a reasonable<br/>
fizzle<br/>
rate, in my opinion.  With Bellow, I missed one note in 60.  With Hymn, I<br/>
missed<br/>
3 in 60.  After that, I grew weary of counting. :)<br/>
<br/>
If your test was Denon&#39;s Discord, I think I know what the problem might<br/>
be...<br/>
perhaps there IS a bug in that it&#39;s checking the instrument skill regardless<br/>
of<br/>
whether you&#39;re singing or playing an instrument.   If you&#39;re like me, your<br/>
brass<br/>
skill is one of the only ones not maxed out, and denon&#39;s discord uses brass.<br/>
