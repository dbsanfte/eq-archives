<div id="ygrps-yiv-917519837">Have to agree here.  You did fine on your stats.  I tend to put everything<br/>
in charisma and stamina when I create a Bard.  Stamina adds a good number of<br/>
hp per level and helps a ton in the long run.  And there really aren&#39;t very<br/>
many *useful* +STA items in the game.  There are a few but there are other<br/>
items with better AC/resists/dam whatever that you will much prefer to wear.<br/>
Strength seems, by far, to be the easiest stat to raise with items (asside<br/>
from, possibly, agility).<br/>
<br/>
But the stats you chose are fine.  No need to re-roll and items can easily<br/>
get you up into the 130-150 range.  Our armor is +1cha per peice and there<br/>
are a couple other very nice items we can get that boost charisma just fine.<br/>
When I want to go nuts on Charisma (and like Sylly I have not noticed any<br/>
significant difference in performance from a 120 charisma or a 180 charisma)<br/>
I just throw on a bunch of charisma gear (there is a LOT of it out there).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your Bard ;)  And character creation is a personal choice.  Those<br/>
starting points are best used to get as many (if not all) of your stats<br/>
above 75 and as many (as possible) of your primary stats up near 100 if you<br/>
have points left over.<br/>
<br/>
Why above 75?  75 seems to be the &quot;magic&quot; number where things start to get<br/>
&#39;normal&#39;.  Below 75 you take some rather nasty penalties on skills that rely<br/>
on stats.  Above or at 75 things seem normal.  100 because that seems to be<br/>
the point of diminishing returns for our stats.  Up till 100 stat increases<br/>
do a lot for us, after 100 (asside from Cha for bards and possibly STR)<br/>
stats are really pointless.<br/>

&gt; Always great to see another bard and especially one on Innoruuk (my server<br/>
&gt; too!) I cant imagine who thinks you need 150+ cha to be effective.  I dont<br/>
&gt; have that kind of cha and do as well as can be expected.  It&#39;s good to be<br/>
&gt; thinking ahead and high str and cha that you have rolled seem just fine to<br/>
&gt; me.  I am considering that sta might be worth while as it is rather hard<br/>

&gt; p?)  - yes we have a sta song and depending on your weps (and friends to<br/>
&gt; buff you) you can use that.  In EQ today, Level is God, AC Is King, and<br/>
&gt; resists are your best friends.  All the other stats are marginal after you<br/>
&gt; get them to a decent level (around 100 or so).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am a half elf bard. I went with 95 str and 90 cha. I have been going<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; cha over other stats. I got +7 cha +5 dex rings and the earings that add<br/>
&gt; +5<br/>
&gt; &gt; cha and +2 ac. thats 114 cha. I am more of a team player then a soloest!<br/>
