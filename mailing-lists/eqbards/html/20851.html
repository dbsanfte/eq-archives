<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586765012">I&#39;ve never had a problem getting help from guides.  Generally speaking of<br/>
you word your petition politely they&#39;ll be a LOT more likely to help you<br/>
than if you&#39;re rude or sarcastic ;)  It also helps if you&#39;re actually nice<br/>
to them when they show up and don&#39;t complain about how long it takes ;)<br/>
Guides are EXTREMELY busy ;)  Do the math:  1 or 2 guides online, 2000<br/>
players online.  Average Guide Petition Queue:  40+, average resolution<br/>
time:  5-10 minutes.  #petitions per hour:  40 at peak time<br/>
<br/>
(yes, I used to be a Senior Guide)<br/>
<br/>
As you can see they get burried pretty fast.  I remember when the game first<br/>
went &#39;live&#39; we used to see queue&#39;s of over 300 petitions with 1 guide<br/>
online.  NOT fun.  And an angry player generally got very cursory help<br/>
because the guide was already frustrated by the sheer volume of calls.  We<br/>
lost a LOT of guides in those days.  It&#39;s still a problem.  People just<br/>
don&#39;t understand that there is no way 1 person can keep up with 2000<br/>
people&#39;s problems in any kind of timely manner.<br/>
<br/>
Tips for best results when working with a guide:<br/>
1)  Do not quote the rules to them.  They already know the rules (likely<br/>
better than you ever will)<br/>
2)  Be nice<br/>
3)  Do not ask questions or make statements about how long it took them to<br/>
get to you.<br/>
4)  No matter what the result of your petition wish them a good evening and<br/>
tell them you hope the Queue remains low.  (They WILL remember you, trust<br/>
me)<br/>
5)  When you&#39;re on and DONT have a problem occasionally put in a petition<br/>
that just says &quot;Hey hope you&#39;re having a great night!  Sorry you gotta guide<br/>
instead of play&quot; or something like that.  Don&#39;t SPAM them with em but trust<br/>
me!  You will be remembered.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that some people get preferential treatment.  I am saying<br/>
that if they know you as a complainer they&#39;re less likely to take you at<br/>
your word than they are if they know you as a friendly person that doesn&#39;t<br/>
complain much and is understanding of their situation.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Um, how do you do this?  My experience has beenthat<br/>
&gt; they aren&#39;t very helpful...<br/>
