<div id="ygrps-yiv-900196861">if you are grouped with an enchanter and/or shaman you are always going to<br/>
feel like that.  i say take a break from your normal do-it-all<br/>
responsibilities =)  and when there is no enchanter around, you can come to<br/>
the rescue.<br/>

&gt; tight guild (and a lot of them are available on the weekend), I play<br/>
&gt; mostly with my guild.  This means that a typical party is:  Me,<br/>
&gt; Enchanter, Cleric, maybe a Shaman, tanks.  The tanks always include at<br/>
&gt; least one ranger/druid (snare) or paladin (root) for stopping MOBs.<br/>
