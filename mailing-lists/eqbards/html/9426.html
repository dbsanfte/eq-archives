<div id="ygrps-yiv-541773597">The Paw is worth WAY more than the drum.  On Sol Ro the drum goes for around<br/>
250 to 300, the Paw is a TRADE ONLY item that if sold would fetch over<br/>
1000pp and probably closer to 2000pp.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very close to completing a Paw of Opolla.  This is perhaps the best<br/>
&gt; non-Planes item for Clerics, Druids and Shamans (AC 9, STA +5, WIS +9, AGI<br/>
&gt; +9, MANA +5, SV DISEASE -5 and CHA -5).  I started the quest a<br/>
&gt; few weeks ago<br/>
&gt; before we knew about the Lambent quests :-)  A 50th Wiz on Fennin Ro the<br/>
&gt; other night was auctioning for trade a MM Battle Drum.  I told him I was<br/>
&gt; close to completing the Paw and he offered to trade TWO sets of MM Battle<br/>
&gt; Drums for the completed Paw.  A friend of mine that is familiar<br/>
&gt; with the Wiz<br/>
&gt; says that he bought the drums on ebay, I dunno...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What is the consensus?  Is this a fair trade?  Be it known that<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve camped<br/>
&gt; Paw pieces for approximately 25 hours and had to get my baking skill up as<br/>
&gt; well (and we bards are the brightest bunch).  At 28th I think that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; approaching the level that I would expect to be able to get a MM<br/>
&gt; Battle Drum<br/>
&gt; with my own group.  Is this correct?<br/>
