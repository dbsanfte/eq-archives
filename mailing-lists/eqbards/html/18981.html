<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134435202">Well it&#39;s entirely possible that it&#39;s not foraged at all.  The guild could<br/>
have given me some misinformation somehow.  After all there *is* an oven way<br/>
in the back of the Temple of Droga that has *no reason* to be back there<br/>
except for quests.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to travel all the way there just<br/>
to hang out back around a bunch of scowling level 33-36 mobs making myself<br/>
some pies.  :-)<br/>
