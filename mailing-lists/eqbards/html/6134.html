helm.  Of course, I hate anything that covers up my naturally boyish good<br/>
looks ;)  But in any case, when I upgraded to Bronze (I&#39;m only 19th, BTW -<br/>
Bronze isn&#39;t considered &quot;twinkie&quot; by this level, since so many people are<br/>
buying and selling it) that was the UGLIEST helm I&#39;d ever seen.  I looked<br/>
like the Rocketman :P  Fortunately, I had saved my Banded helm, and so I<br/>
went back to it - at least it was better than Bronze.  I understand<br/>
Rubicite follows the Bronze model, in which case, I may just dodge Rubi<br/>
helms, too :P<br/>
