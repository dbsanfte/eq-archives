<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124368272">In the patch news there is mention of a system they have where you have to<br/>
kill some things to make certain other things spawn.  I know that is pretty<br/>
vague and knowing Verant it might be pretty obtuse.  But I bet there is a<br/>
&#39;trick&#39; to it and someone will discover it.  And then for all of 3 days he<br/>
will be the only one with the stuff.  As soon as he tells his best friend...<br/>
3days later lots will have and every spoiler site will have details.<br/>
<br/>
Just a guess,<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
for Zahal - try killing all the ghouls and undead - like lots and lots and<br/>
lots - just guessing but they did say you have to kill stuff...<br/>

		given up on the bracers because that stupid ghoul in NK<br/>
won&#39;t spawn either.</div>
