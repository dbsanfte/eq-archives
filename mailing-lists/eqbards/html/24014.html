<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071969572">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just generally been lurking lately as I&#39;ve been busy at work. I hope <br/>
the following doesn&#39;t offend anyone, but if it does, feel free to flame me <br/>
personally or stick a pin in your nearest Windleaf voodoo doll.<br/>
<br/>
However, I thought I&#39;d offer some tips on effective arguing. I&#39;m guilty of <br/>
the following and probably will continue to be, but it never hurts to have <br/>
a reminder:<br/>
<br/>
1) Avoid making personal criticisms:<br/>
   A) Avoid the use of the word &quot;you&quot;. Statements with &quot;you&quot; are taken <br/>
personally whether it&#39;s intended<br/>
       or not and and generally puts people on the defensive. During the <br/>
proofread, try removing any &quot;you&quot;<br/>
       references.<br/>
<br/>
   B) No name calling. It&#39;s pretty easy to avoid calling someone a name, <br/>
but also avoid calling their ideas<br/>
       names. For example, calling someone&#39;s idea &quot;dumb&quot; isn&#39;t going to <br/>
make them respect your<br/>
       opinions and would probably make them ignore the point you were <br/>
trying to make.<br/>
<br/>
2) Avoid analogies. It&#39;s hard to make a good analogy. But even if you make <br/>
a good one, people tend to start attacking your analogy or making up one on <br/>
their own, and soon it degenerates to the point where everyone&#39;s arguing <br/>
about whether low gravity on a planet affects the local space time <br/>
continuum. (I&#39;ve actually sat in on one degraded to this and tried my best <br/>
to get away).<br/>
<br/>
Basically, an analogy tends to move the topic of discussion away from the <br/>
actual facts and points.<br/>
<br/>
3) If making an opinion, back it up with good facts or analysis. Everyone <br/>
knows everyone else has opinions, but they are going to ignore yours unless <br/>
you can back it up with good reasoning or hard evidence.<br/>
