<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758937778">Something very much like this happened to me last night, causing me to<br/>
lose my level.  I turned in the crafted greaves components and got the<br/>
greaves and exp, and all the centaurs immediately attacked me.  Guides<br/>
said too bad, so sad so, I guess it&#39;s back to the birdhouse for me.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t attack (my attack key is f12, so I was nowhere near that) and I<br/>
didn&#39;t accidentally hit any area spells (the hotkey page I was on<br/>
didn&#39;t have any area spells on it).  Plus, they didn&#39;t attack my group<br/>
partner after I was dead.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to check if they were<br/>
still KOS to me, since I had my body dragged to the bridge and camped<br/>
after I got dressed.  I was not terribly happy that the guides<br/>
wouldn&#39;t res me after such an obvious bug, but with no way to prove<br/>
it, I guess they really can&#39;t do anything.  Anyone else have this<br/>
happen on other quests?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is another bug I have run into which creeped in in the last patch.<br/>
&gt; Apparently if you complete the Squad Ring Quest currently, you are handed<br/>
&gt; the ring and also immediately moved to KoS status will all residents of<br/>
&gt; Rivervale.  How the heck do they miss this stuff?  Sounds like they either<br/>
&gt; changed the faction hit for getting the ring, say from 5% to 100% (oops<br/>
&gt; D&#39;Vinn coder, should been 10%) or they added a faction gain that puts the<br/>
&gt; faction &#39;over the top&#39; thus turning it into a negative number.  After<br/>
&gt; telling my bardic friend on E&#39;ci how cool the ring was he finally completed<br/>
&gt; the quest this morning.  He is currently unable to play that character after<br/>
&gt; immediately dying to Marshal Ghobber and reappearing at his bind point...<br/>
&gt; Right in front of the PoD in the middle of Rivervale square.  Needless to<br/>
&gt; say the overzealous litle Zorros immediately whacked him again... and<br/>
&gt; again... and again... before he figured out what must be happening and<br/>
&gt; pulled the plug.  I saw 4 corpses in the Marshal Ghobber room last nite but<br/>
&gt; thought little of it chalking it up to the usual <br/>
&gt; W...H &quot;Hail Marshal Ghobber&quot;...A &quot;you hit Marshal Ghobber but he dodges&quot;<br/>
&gt; syndrome of forgetting to hit ENTER first.<br/>
&gt; This appears to be a major screwup that has seriously affected quite a<br/>
&gt; number of characters due to careless coding yet again.  I&#39;m certain my<br/>
&gt; friend has lost at least one level if not more before he was disconnected.<br/>
&gt; Not to mention the incredible amount of work he put into getting his faction<br/>
&gt; high enough to get the ring in the first place.<br/>
&gt; Has anyone else experienced this?<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any word on how they are planning on fixing this?<br/>
