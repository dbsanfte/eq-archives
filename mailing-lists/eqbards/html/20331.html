<div id="ygrps-yiv-296835107">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I saw this on a list I lurk on (EQCleric).  While I don&#39;t agree with<br/>
the original post or even that there is a perfect group, notice that<br/>
bards appear many times in most of the different groups proposed (and<br/>
I CAN agree with that!).<br/>

PS - Better (not perfect) groups are ones that include intelligent,<br/>
motivated people looking for fun that happen to get good xp and loot<br/>
along the way - my opinion of course.  And ANY class can fit into<br/>
that group.<br/>

Subject: Groups<br/>
<br/>
One of my guild mates came across an interesting post on what someone<br/>
that was the best group to have Pre-Kunark and Post-Kunark. I have<br/>
included most of the original post mostly for the poster&#39;s thoughts<br/>
on Clerics.  It is an interesting variation to say the least. I find<br/>
it somewhat difficult to believe that this group is particularly<br/>
viable but it obviously works for the guy that posted it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Snip&gt;<br/>
Slight changes in the post Kunark age.<br/>
Pre-Kunark it was :-<br/>
<br/>
Monk<br/>
Rogue/Necro/Mage<br/>
Rogue/Necro/Mage<br/>
Shaman<br/>
Enchanter<br/>
Druid<br/>
<br/>
A lot of dumb people would go with a Cleric but that was far less<br/>
efficient, the death penalty was so low that a Cleric was an<br/>
expensive luxury that cost the group in terms of XP efficiency. That<br/>
was unless you needed the *convenience* of Res, to get a member back<br/>
when they couldn&#39;t walk there.<br/>
<br/>
The others are self-explanatory. Monk pulls, Shaman Togors, Enchanter<br/>
mezzes any extras while the machine section go to work with<br/>
*mana-free* mel├®e damage. I.e. no downtime.<br/>
<br/>
This group can go anywhere, do anything and it does it with *zero*<br/>
downtime.<br/>
<br/>
In the Kunark age, there are a couple of differences :-<br/>
<br/>
Monk<br/>
Rogue<br/>
Rogue<br/>
Shaman<br/>
Enchanter<br/>
Cleric<br/>
<br/>
Over level 60, the death penalty is just too great. It removes the<br/>
efficiency of not using a Cleric. Plus Damage Shields are near<br/>
worthless on Turgur&#39;d mobs (Druids are big losers in Kunark).<br/>
<br/>
The other change is that the new Kunark weapons mean the Mage and<br/>
Necro can&#39;t keep up with the Rogue any more. Which is kind of ironic,<br/>
IMHO. Rogues are probably the most over-powered class in the game -<br/>
and they are going to get buffed more. Of course, their penalty is<br/>
they can&#39;t solo. At all. But at 55 plus, there is no soloing any more.<br/>
<br/>
The main problem with this group now is that you don&#39;t have a travel<br/>
spell. This doesn&#39;t really matter for combat (evac is for kids), but<br/>
it can be an inconvenience if, for example, you are a group of<br/>
friends wanting a long term party.<br/>
<br/>
What you *don&#39;t* want in a good group :-<br/>
<br/>
Magic based damage - can you say Downtime!<br/>
Hybrids strike 1 - piss poor mel├®e damage output.<br/>
Hybrids strike 2 - huge experience penalty.<br/>
<br/>
A *good* Bard, i.e. one that puts away the stupid weapons and uses<br/>
their DoTs with instruments, managing mob agro properly, can add the<br/>
to group. But most Bards are clueless schmucks, so it isn&#39;t worth<br/>
trying to educate them as they flail away with their Yaks and no<br/>
Double Attack.<br/>

PPS:  I like to think we here aren&#39;t most Bards.  With what I read<br/>
here and try in game, I know I have a lot to learn yet, but I hope<br/>
(and try) to adapt to each group and be the best I can.  Pie<br/>

<br/>
Bah. There is no &quot;perfect group&quot;. It is all situation dependant.<br/>
Here&#39;s a group that I never thought would work (everyone around 40th<br/>
level):<br/>
<br/>
bard<br/>
bard<br/>
cleric<br/>
cleric<br/>
druid<br/>
enchanter<br/>
<br/>
Bard mana songs stack with each other and clarity so mana recovery<br/>
was VERY fast. We were fighting undead so the clerics could act like<br/>
wizards. We could fight three mobs as once with no tanks and no<br/>
mezzes and could handle up to 7 with mezzes (since the clerics could<br/>
blast so well). And we were able to fight in a dangerous place since<br/>
we had so much crowd control and evac. The bards have a bad xp<br/>
penalty but we killed things FAST.<br/>
<br/>
Another awesome group:<br/>
<br/>
warrior<br/>
monk<br/>
shadowknight<br/>
rogue<br/>
bard<br/>
cleric<br/>
<br/>
With the warrior taunting the cleric Complete Healing there was very<br/>
little downtime. During combat the bard would charm (if 2 pulled) or<br/>
dot/heal/buff. Maybe a monk would have been better than the<br/>
shadowknight (leaving the bard to snare) but it&#39;s the same idea.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can make a &quot;perfect&quot; group if you are a group of friends<br/>
who need to be able to handle any situation. Or maybe you just want<br/>
to go to unrest with 6 necromancers.<br/>

PPSS: I don&#39;t have mana song yet, but I sure get asked a lot.  I plan<br/>
to use it during downtime (per the advice of many bards posting here)<br/>
and situation specific songs during a battle.  I can already see the<br/>
&quot;requests&quot; coming to just play mana song though.  Pie</div>
