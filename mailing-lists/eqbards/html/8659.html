&gt; &gt;Oh come on, you can take HG&#39;s. Be creative, I can do 2 HG&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;within about 8 minutes, Im sure you could do better than that :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t mean to sound condescending, but I don&#39;t believe you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At level 30 you are lucky if you can solo anything white+.<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t reliably do clops until level 34ish.  Your songs<br/>
&gt; just wont stick on a monster at least _FIVE_ levels higher<br/>
&gt; than you.  I guess if you hit it right, and got lucky --<br/>
&gt; you could chain+bellow the thing, but that&#39;s gonna take about<br/>
&gt; 20 mins to kill.  If you were refering to charming the HGs,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried it at 39 and it&#39;s very risky, a few resists and<br/>
&gt; you could die pretty easily.  I used charm extensively around<br/>
&gt; level 30 in highkeep versus red raiders, and it lasted at most<br/>
&gt; 5 seconds, sometimes less.  Chains+fear on an HG is futile,<br/>
&gt; I cannot even do it at level 39.  They still resist too much.<br/>
&gt; And if he hits me a few times, hp bubbles vanish.  I have<br/>
&gt; gotten lucky, mind you.  But I tend to lean toward statistics<br/>
&gt; rather than luck, because in the end you will pay the piper.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Goodness...its really not that risky at all.  I&#39;ve been killing giants<br/>
since 29 - when I started, there would be some too high for<br/>
me, charm wouldn&#39;t stick, and I&#39;d have to zone, but since 32<br/>
or so, if I see two giants, a few minutes later they&#39;ll be at least<br/>
one less. :) (Depending on how weakened the victor of the battle<br/>
is, its sometimes more efficient to zone rather than  kite him down.)<br/>
<br/>
As for songs not sticking, yes, they do resist a lot.  But, we have<br/>
this handy song called selos, and charm has a *huge* range.  Just<br/>
stand way back, sing it, if he resists, run back and try again.   Once<br/>
it sticks, swing underneath him (this is the dangerous part), so you&#39;re<br/>
in  range for him to hear your commands, target the second giant<br/>
that you hopefully arranged to be nearby, have your new pet charge<br/>
in to battle, hit F1 twice to retarget your pet, and you&#39;re all set.  As<br/>
soon as they rush you, recharm the pet, and back they go to swinging<br/>
at each other.<br/>
<br/>
As for dying, I don&#39;t think I have yet...Though I&#39;ve come *way* too<br/>
close, mostly because of lag or having to steer my dueling fools around<br/>
lowbies in the area.  But even at a half a bubble of health, without a MMB,<br/>
I still barely outran them.<br/>
<br/>
Keep selos up at all times when you do this, of course.  My standard twist<br/>
is charm-selos-selo.  At 35 charm will pretty much stick the full duration<br/>
on blue giants, so I don&#39;t have to do much running anymore, but only an idiot<br/>
will open himself up to a round of attacks from two pissed of giants if he can<br/>
help it. :)<br/>
