<div id="ygrps-yiv-216453600">With my spiked collar I have only 88 strength, shall keep it I shall.  I<br/>
have decided that now is the time to journey down that road which is<br/>
alchohol dependency, for I think one day along my route I shall be wearing a<br/>
few plate items.  I consider the effect on strength may be quite beneficial<br/>
with a high tolerance for the stuff.  Anyone else an experienced alchoholic?<br/>
<br/>
(I can just see myself one day constantly overloaded, and only lifting my<br/>
burden in battle with song)<br/>
<br/>
Right now at a tolerance of 10 (hard earned, I might add, heh) I notice no<br/>
real difference after a few drinks, as in reduction of the negative effects.<br/>
Even then, I don&#39;t believe I am affected much by my loss in intelligence, as<br/>
a bard.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to take up brewing, and have not successfully made my own yet,<br/>
grrr.  Is the book of lymrics required?  I -think- I saw the book near the<br/>
gnomish city, cannot be certain.  Anyone suggest where I may find it on the<br/>
mainland (freeport area, but I can travel to Qeynos if need be).<br/>
<br/>
Remember the old Bard&#39;s Tale?  Ah, this was where Roop was born, so long<br/>
long ago.  Had to keep my whistle wet back then, just to continue barding!<br/>
A bard here is not required to imbibe, which is fine, though a bit<br/>
out-of-character in my own opinion.<br/>
<br/>
So far I am quite pleased with the effects of alchohol here.  A friend and I<br/>
returned from adventures to fine Rivervale, and in celebration of our<br/>
success I purchased 1pp worth of fishwine, weeoooo!  And I never laughed so<br/>
hard as when I heard my comrade speak, or rather burbble... the drunken<br/>
language.  That fishwine has a kick!  At least someone might describe the<br/>
components one uses to create fishwine in the still?  I have developed a<br/>
taste for the stuff.  Mead, for some odd reason, cannot be drunk?  And, how<br/>
does one actually use a shotglass?  I am still just guzzling directly from<br/>
the bottle itself, uncooth, I know.<br/>
