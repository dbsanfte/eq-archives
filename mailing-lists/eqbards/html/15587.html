<div id="ygrps-yiv-254754506">Ack, I am very sorry to hear your misfortune.<br/>
Now, this is the type of person I am but I would be really pissed right<br/>
now, you should report this person to a GM, I am sure something can be done<br/>
because I remember reading a post on www.everquest.com about a guy who was<br/>
given consent, looted the corpse and then logged, he posted saying that his<br/>
brother wanted to play, well anyway, the gm&#39;s banned his account, he then<br/>
logged onto his brother account and got that one banned, he then continued<br/>
to get another brothers account banned. The GM&#39;s also got the equipment<br/>
back for this unfortunate person who had it stolen from him.<br/>
<br/>
Go report this person NOW. He deserves all he gets for being such an ass<br/>
hole.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, rant over. Goodluck, I hope you get your stuff back.<br/>

Hello everyone :)<br/>
<br/>
Well I just wanted to tell you a little tale so that you can all remember<br/>
not to make my mistakes.  Last night, I made the mistake of consenting<br/>
someone to drag Tani&#39;s corpse out of the Scryer room in Guk.  Well, long<br/>
story short, all my armor and weapons were stolen (punishment for twinking,<br/>
heh) by this guy.<br/>
<br/>
There are all sorts of complicating sidelines to this story which I&#39;ll<br/>
spare<br/>
you.  Although I know it was always a risk, I just never thought someone<br/>
would be so mean and viscious.  The items are just items, but people that<br/>
do<br/>
that stuff just plain suck!<br/>
<br/>
Guess I&#39;ll have to make a contest to see how much of my quest stuff I can<br/>
get back in one week.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you&#39;re all having a great day... and DON&#39;T CONSENT SOMEONE YOU DON&#39;T<br/>
KNOW!!!<br/>
(most of you have probably figured that out - guess I get to wear the naive<br/>
banner for the week)<br/>
