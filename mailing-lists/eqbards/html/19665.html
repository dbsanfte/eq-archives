<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904612320">Both ranger  and druid in my guild have said that they foraged a bunt cake.<br/>
I think it is &quot;just&quot; a bunt cake not &quot;the&quot; burynai bunt cake.  There are<br/>
dronga quests where you combind items in various things like the forge, etc.<br/>
The names of the forage, brew barrel, etc. all imply that skill in the trade<br/>
is not a factor (NeverFail, AlwaysWork, etc etc.)<br/>
<br/>
So, very probably, you need to get a bunt cake, get the recipe, get the<br/>
other needed items and bake it in the oven in Dronga.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like Verant is trying to add more of these kinds of quests.  They have<br/>
recently tried to complete the monk quest for the Whistling Fist Robe (?? I<br/>
think its a robe.)  It&#39;s the completion of the headbands quest they had.<br/>
And they also said they were gonna patch so that skill in the trade is not a<br/>
factor.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Burynai bundt cake quest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This has been a topic on my guild mailing list lately.  Some druid and<br/>
&gt; rangers in the guild have been foraging in Field of Bone recently based on<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; rumor that the bundt cake could be foraged there. </span></blockquote></div>
