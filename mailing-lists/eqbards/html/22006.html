<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188021598">My guild used this method for about 6 months.  It worked pretty well, but it&#39;s hard to balance, and really<br/>
tough on the bookkeeper.  We abandoned it for dictatorial socialism.  Any item won in a guild group (more<br/>
than 50% guild members) is guild property, and is assigned by the guild leaders based on guild need.<br/>
Items stay in guild until nobody wants them, at which point they&#39;re sold to finance Sky raids and such or<br/>
traded for usable items.  You would think this would open us up for a lot of whining, but we&#39;ve had very<br/>
little trouble with it.  The few people who didn&#39;t like it quit, the rest are fine with it.  We&#39;re about<br/>
80 members, most with at least one character above 50, so it&#39;s not like this is a tiny group of close<br/>
friends either.<br/>

&gt; I had a look at your guild&#39;s site and read up on your loot systems (you were<br/>
&gt; in the negative loot points, iirc ;)  That sounds like a very good system,<br/>
&gt; and I was wondering if other guilds on other servers did similarly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m certainly not in any position to worry about that yet, having just<br/>
&gt; gotten level 32 (yay me!) and my guild certainly isn&#39;t in the realms of<br/>
&gt; uberness like others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; well with us it merely depends on how many points you have in our loot<br/>
&gt; system.  last night a bard got a white scale off gorenaire and a warrior got<br/>
&gt; a red scale off talendor.  i&#39;m in no rush to get one, the pieces will come<br/>
&gt; as they come.<br/>
