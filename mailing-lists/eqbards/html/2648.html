<b>Subject:</b> What would you do in this situation? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-909735375">Just to see where I fit on the cheater scale relative to the rest of this<br/>
list, here&#39;s a situation from a week or two ago, which involved a bug<br/>
exploit.<br/>
<br/>
We were in Splitpaw when someone released the insta-kill necro (I forget<br/>
his name).  My entire party died.  When we returned to get our corpses,<br/>
there was no sign of the necro.  Whew.  Still, we decided that we had<br/>
had enough, and we started heading out.  On the way out, we ran across<br/>
the necro again!  This time, he was stuck in a gate.  Now, as far as I<br/>
know, the path we were taking was the only way out from the depths where<br/>
we had retrieved our corpses.  If the mob had been working properly, we<br/>
surely would have perished again.  As it was, we were able to get out<br/>
of his range (and out of the dungeon) before any of us succumbed to his<br/>
DoT spells, and being stuck, he could not give chase.<br/>
<br/>
So, I admit it.  We cheated.  We exploited the fact that this guy was stuck<br/>
in a gate to escpe with our skins intact.  Perhaps we should have stood<br/>
there and waited for him to kill us with DoT spells to avoid taking <br/>
advantage of the bug.  But as usual with issues like this, my question is,<br/>
&quot;Where&#39;s the fun in that?&quot;<br/>
