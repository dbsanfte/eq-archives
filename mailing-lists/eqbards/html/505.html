<div id="ygrps-yiv-757839815">The Cauldron is a bad idea for a Level 10. It is a bad idea for m at Level<br/>
15 unless I have a pretty good group.<br/>

Don&#39;t buy ringmail . . . buy banded armor. Much better, and probably<br/>
cheaper depending on the smith you get it from. As far as I know, makes<br/>
your character look exactly the same. I started buying my banded set when I<br/>
was Level 10 . . . completed it at Level 14 to the tune of about 120 plat.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I made levels 10 and 11 easily in Blackburrow. Just kill all the<br/>
Gnolls, Patrolling Gnolls, and Giant Snakes you can handle. The place is<br/>
train central, but since it is &quot;outdoors&quot; you can outrun most trains . . .<br/>
or you can group and kill guards and elites. I made about 5 plat per trip.<br/>

&gt;Thought 10th circle was specific enough, but 10th lvl.  Already got my basic <br/>
&gt;PW set back and such, but it seems like I should be moving onto ringmail by <br/>
&gt;this time, least I see some bards with it on.  And heard that maybe Dagnor&#39;s <br/>
&gt;is good since they have aqua goblins? good money/exp.<br/>
