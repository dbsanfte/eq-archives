<div id="ygrps-yiv-114294351">Best place to hunt for good money and decent money and exp? Though most<br/>
anyone will dispute me go to the Ocean of Tears(take the boat from<br/>
Kaladim or Freeport). The aqua goblins ALWAYS have atleast 1gp on them<br/>
because of the bows they carry, and are good exp for 10-11. Then you can<br/>
move onto aviaks(going back to aqua gobs for money), at lvl 12 who will<br/>
occasionally carry a bronze weapon. At 12 you can lead the out with a<br/>
bellow and strike them from there, and if you get in trouble there are<br/>
several areas around the island where the aviaks will not run back to<br/>
get their &quot;friends&quot; that will resul in huge trains, and from there you<br/>
can bellow them to death or sit their gaining health with a lute. Since<br/>
almost nobody hunts in OOT there is hardly anyone to take monstys from<br/>
ya. I gained 4 pp and a buble or exp last night playing my lvl 12, and<br/>
thats including swimming back and forth when my bags get full. If you<br/>
ever need a map Jooren on the Solusek Ro(sorry only there) sells them<br/>
for 1pp a piece, which is damm good considering its very helpful if you<br/>
don&#39;t know your way around and it can&#39;t be found anywhere else to my<br/>
knowledge.<br/>

&gt; I think it&#39;s great bards can wear chain/banded/etc. What looks more<br/>
&gt; dashing than a suit of silver or gold=) As for weapons, I&#39;m not a big<br/>
&gt; RPGer so I&#39;m going to continue to use my mino axe until something better<br/>
&gt; comes along, like some kind of bard specific weapon( though I doubt<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll have any because of our songs) On a side note What is the best<br/>
&gt; place for a 10th level bard to gain good money and decent exp. because I<br/>
&gt; am in the process of buying some banded armor.<br/>
