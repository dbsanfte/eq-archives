<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-975652732">Some guildies and I decided to hit Lower Guk yeseterday (totally randomally<br/>
a balanced party of 6 40+ were hanging out early in the day, someone says<br/>
&quot;Lets see if we can get a good Guk camp!&quot;)  So in about 30 minutes we are<br/>
holding the scribe, sage, exe, cav and savant (No one else was pulling from<br/>
that area, we were sitting in the sage room).<br/>
<br/>
So the xp is just flying in (I got about 4 bubsof 41 in maybe 6 hours!).<br/>
And then the loot begins to drop.  Mostly standard stuff, but no one in the<br/>
group knows what the book and quill from Scribe do.  They let mehold them<br/>
(neither are no drop).  Does anyone here know?</div>
