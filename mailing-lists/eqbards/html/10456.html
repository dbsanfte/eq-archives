<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121640375">Grifeene&#39;s are pretty easy - maybe 1 in 10 drop the charm.  Maybe 1 in 20?<br/>
Not too bad. I always had ranger or druid or bard friends helping me.  Don&#39;t<br/>
get snarfed by Grimfeather! Mudwater runes - I got mine in the normal course<br/>
of CT fighting - at like level 32 to 34ish.  <br/>
<br/>
The DW Gobbies presented more of a problem though.  Saw one at half health<br/>
and tried to take it with a SK friend - we were both lo 30&#39;s and we both<br/>
died.  My friends got to be lo 40&#39;s and were hunting spec&#39;s in Oasis and<br/>
figured out how to pull or where to pull DW gobs and called me over.  We<br/>
killed at least 20 before we got a helm and they quit for bigger game.  I<br/>
was like 35/36 when we got the helm.<br/>
