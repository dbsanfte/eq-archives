<b>Subject:</b> Has the z-axis bug been fixed? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266531610">There is a current topic on the Concert Hall board discussing the use of AE<br/>
songs (CoD, DDD) in dungeons.  Andres Tal, who is the bard rep for EQ<br/>
Casters and a reputable poster, stated that AE songs shouldn&#39;t aggo through<br/>
walls/floors any more due to a recent fix/patch.  There has to be a line of<br/>
sight between you and the mob for these songs to cause damage.  If this is<br/>
the case, then it would indicate our AE songs are no longer affected by the<br/>
z-axis bug.  Not certain I really want to test it though to confirm if he is<br/>
correct:-)<br/>
