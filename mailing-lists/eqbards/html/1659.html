&gt;Very rarely do I disagree with more points in a single post than this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;But we are not<br/>
&gt;&gt;designed for soloing like the Ranger or Paladin are.  Frankly, anyone who<br/>
&gt;&gt;complains about not being able to solo well as a Bard is missing the point<br/>
&gt;&gt;to being a Bard.  You want to be alone?  Play a Ranger. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m level 23, and I soloed to 23 with no problem. Why? Because Bards are<br/>
&gt;simply an awesome solo class. We heal fast so we can engage in battle much<br/>
&gt;more rapidly without relying on a healer or the ability to &quot;sit this battle<br/>
&gt;out&quot; for healing. We run fast so we can escape the battles we are going to<br/>
&gt;lose, eithout relying on a party to save us. The Level 8 song allows us to<br/>
&gt;take single handedly a camp which would require a large group. We have a<br/>
&gt;decent fighting ability, and plenty of HP. I&#39;m sure soloing gets harder and<br/>
&gt;harder after level 23, but the game is supposed to get harder as one goes<br/>
&gt;along anyhow, I&#39;m up for the challenge.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry to disappoint you but you are going to find soloing a near,i say<br/>
again near impossibility, especially after 30..i soled alot till 17 or so<br/>
then did the group/solo thing. I am now 34 almost level 35 and it is a near<br/>
absolute need for me to group. 1st its hard to find blue cons that are<br/>
alone and not in groups...2nd these blues would near kill me every time<br/>
even if i could solo one singley...3rd when you get higher you will be<br/>
forced into dungeons..yea you could try kiting giants but the time it takes<br/>
and the danger involved isnt worth the effort..btw the loot on giants sucks<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Well, frankly,<br/>
&gt;&gt;if you&#39;re grouping, you should be gaining experience faster.  True, each<br/>
&gt;&gt;kill gives you less, but the overall result of being able to kill<br/>
&gt;&gt;repeatedly in shorter periods of time, or handle multiple creatures at a<br/>
&gt;&gt;time balances that out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I gain so little exp in a group it isn&#39;t even funny. This is why I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;group, because the exp is AWFUL. Anyone else had the same experience? If<br/>
&gt;you haven&#39;t tried soloing, I suggest you try it. You may never want to go<br/>
&gt;back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here i gotta strongly disagree..if you are in a half way decent group your<br/>
kill/downtime ratio should far outway the greater exp per kill of<br/>
soloing...ive tried both and found with a good group i get at least double<br/>
the exp compared to when i try soloing..if you do it time spent/exp.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And my final point of the night: (And here&#39;s where I expect to work on my<br/>
&gt;&gt;dodge skill:) I think Bards should be denied Plate Mail.  Already I can<br/>
&gt;&gt;hear the Battle Bards winding up - but hear me out:  The Bard was never<br/>
&gt;&gt;intended to be a grunt-class.  The big burly types should be the ones<br/>
&gt;&gt;soaking the damage and such, not us.  Of course, before they make any<br/>
&gt;&gt;changes like this, they should also fix that tiny little bug that makes us<br/>
&gt;&gt;the primary target ALL the time :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I do group, I find one of my main selling points is &quot;I can&#39;t dish out<br/>
&gt;the damage, but I sure can take it&quot;. It seems to me that platemail is a<br/>
&gt;perfect way to counter-balance the relatively small amount of damage we can<br/>
&gt;do. Very few classes do less raw damage, but I can solo because even the<br/>
&gt;toughest creatures find it difficult to dent my bronze platemail. And in a<br/>
&gt;group, the combination of my platemail and ability to attract the attention<br/>
&gt;of the mobs, makes me a great tank, taking the damage whilst the<br/>
&gt;spellcasters dish it out. From a roleplay perspective (oddly necessary for<br/>
&gt;some of you)  . . . don&#39;t get an image of the Bard as some sort of<br/>
&gt;wandering weakling artist. Our skill may lie in singing, not fighting, but<br/>
&gt;we are strong surviving types. We are used to braving the dangers of the<br/>
&gt;wild, and can take a beating, as well we should.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The platemail thing i side with the GOTTA LOVE IT side. My view is the way<br/>
verant designed the bard he NEEDS the armor especially when you get higher<br/>
up in levels..if they wanted the bard as a party helper who isnt suppossed<br/>
to get in the melee they would have made his buffs and damage songs much<br/>
more effective..as it is,it is clear you are suppossed to mix the songs and<br/>
melee damage to be an effective party member..true i can sometimes play an<br/>
instument instead and contribute but i find battles go much more smoothly<br/>
if i get in there and get my hands bloody  :)<br/>
