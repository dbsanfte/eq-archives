SplitPaw Upgraded - Brad&#39;s response <br/>
SplitPaw was recently upgraded on the Test Server and now sports stronger<br/>
foes and more valuable loot. Here&#39;s part of a thread from Usenet in which EQ<br/>
Producer Brad McQuaid responds to the dungeon upgrade: <br/>
From the Druid&#39;s Grove:<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Saturday night Test was treated to a rare GM event in which high level (high<br/>
20&#39;s to mid-30&#39;s) gnolls were in South Karana running around killing people<br/>
like most typical GM events seem to be. I did not participate but today some<br/>
friends told me that afterwards SplitPaw had been revamped in much the same<br/>
way that Kithicor has and to come check it out. I have not had a chance to<br/>
do so much yet but I can say that the level has been increased to about a<br/>
30-50 lvl dungeon from what I have seen and heard with gnolls conning blue<br/>
to me at 40th at the first bridge area. Not sure if it has been reitemized<br/>
but I am hoping it will be, if so it will be another nice upgrade to a zone<br/>
that Verant has made recently. <br/>
<br/>
Agreed -- lower level players rarely went to Paw, probably because of it&#39;s<br/>
distance. So, now that most of our players are approaching mid-level, we&#39;ve<br/>
changed the zone&#39;s population (and treasure) in hopes it will be more<br/>
popular now. <br/>
