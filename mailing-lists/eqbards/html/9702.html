<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511787313"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible either!  That&#39;s why it&#39;s confusing the heck<br/>
&gt;out of me.  I tested it AGAIN with her last night, and she was still<br/>
&gt;attacking faster than I was.  It *does* increase my attack speed, but hers<br/>
&gt;is increased by a much greater amount.  A new bug?  Something to do with <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;now useless haste function on my spear?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;ve hit upon it.  It coule be that since the weapon can have the <br/>
effect of Haste, and since that song doesn&#39;t seem to like to stick with any <br/>
other Haste type effects/spells/songs, that even though the charges are <br/>
used, this weapon will not be sped up, except with its own haste charge.<br/>
<br/>
Just a guess, though.<br/>
