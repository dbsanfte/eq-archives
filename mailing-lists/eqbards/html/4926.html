<div id="ygrps-yiv-504617356">One question...can<br/>
druids, clerics, etc., or<br/>
those that heal, heal monsters<br/>
that they are fighting if they<br/>
have the monster targeted?  I<br/>
have never played a healer<br/>
type and was wondering if this<br/>
was the case.  Yesterday in<br/>
Permafrost I was grouped with<br/>
a druid that was supposed to<br/>
be healing me when I was<br/>
getting hurt, but for some<br/>
reason every time I asked for<br/>
a heal, the monster would get<br/>
more health and mine would<br/>
still go down.  The druids<br/>
explanation was that there<br/>
were other monsters of its<br/>
race healing it and the reason<br/>
mine was not healing fast is<br/>
because his heal did not work<br/>
very well.  Needless to say I<br/>
died and quickly ungrouped<br/>
from this person.  So is what<br/>
the druid said true?  Or am I<br/>
correct in my assumption that<br/>
the druid was healing the<br/>
monsters?<br/>
