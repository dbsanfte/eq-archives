<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298696862">hmmm, if i am overheating its because fan is dead, because i have a huge<br/>
cooling system in it.  I bought a 3 fan/heat sink from computernerd.com.  My<br/>
buddies at their computer store were in shock when they saw it.  I used to<br/>
run temperature software, and it ran cooler then the original fan/not<br/>
overclocked.  The SB live has the latest drivers. I also have an extra fan<br/>
installed in the front of the pc case.  Its getting gutted tonight to see<br/>
what is going on.<br/>

If you have SB Live - the prob could also be there - but I&#39;m guessing heat<br/>
is your problem.  If you over clock - I&#39;d strongly recommend make making<br/>
sure you have a heat sensor and monitoring software.  Fan cooling and<br/>
airflow is very important.<br/>
<br/>
On the positive side - you can get a replacement Celeron relatively cheap.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - as far as comments on Win 98/ME being faster than 2000 - 2000 has a<br/>
lot more &quot;protection&quot; which comes at a cost processor cycle wise.  Assuming<br/>
you don&#39;t specifically need some of 2000&#39;s features not avail in 95/98/ME<br/>
(networking for example) - you have to choose between stability or speed.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t worked with ME very long - but if Micro$oft can make it&#39;s dates -<br/>
&quot;Whistler&quot; will replace it - their new Consumer OS based on the NT kernel -<br/>
so it very well may be short-lived.<br/>

Hate to say it Minkin but the processor is likely toast.  Once overheating<br/>
begins it is a rapidly accelerating process and you generally never regain<br/>
the original state.  I had one of my machines do this that was overclocked<br/>
and it would never run cool again.  I haven&#39;t overclocked since after mine<br/>
and my friends both went down in the same week.<br/>

I know this is OT, but its driving me nuts. gotta get back ingame asap<br/>
before i get withdrawal symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
I have a celeron 300 overclocked at 466 running on an abit bh6 or bx6 mother<br/>
board for about 2 years now runnin on win98. Run a voodoo 3000 vid card and<br/>
an sb live, oh and a 1* 128meg sim of 100mhz ram.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my problem, I pretty much only play EQ, check email and surf.  Lately<br/>
i&#39;ve had a few solid lockups playing eq, some crashes to desktop as well.<br/>
Yesterday i got 2 in 10-15 minutes and the day before i died while kiting<br/>
due to this (grrr)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I tried deinstalling EQ, reinstalling EQ, RoK and SoV.  While<br/>
reinstalling SoV, total lockup again.  This indicated to me that probably my<br/>
pc is overheating or something.  Another thing i&#39;ve noticed while playing is<br/>
that my graphics seem to be choppier than normal (more vid lag, and its not<br/>
swarmcaller) (which indicates to me processing problems).<br/>
<br/>
So... Tonight I&#39;m going to probably rip the pc open, check if my fan is<br/>
still working, if it is i&#39;ll proceed to downclock the cpu back to 300 like<br/>
its supposed to be.  If my pc is still acting up from there i&#39;ll reinstall<br/>
win98 (arg i hate doing this, takes forever with all my apps).<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the prob may be, I have a<br/>
feeling my cpu might be nearing retirement but i&#39;m really hoping this isnt<br/>
the case because i dont have the cash to buy a new chip/board cause that<br/>
would run me about 350$ canadian for a 700mhz/board<br/>
