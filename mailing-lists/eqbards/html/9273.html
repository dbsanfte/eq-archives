<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there are a couple that are arguably useless (or so I hear, not at a<br/>
level to see for myself), so not having ALL your songs doesn&#39;t make you less<br/>
of a bard (imho).  I&#39;ve got two bards at level 8 on two servers.  The second<br/>
one I started never bought Jig and hasn&#39;t missed it yet.  Eventually I&#39;ll<br/>
get that one, but stamina hasn&#39;t been a thing to worry about yet. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not to pick on your grammar, Sylly, but I&#39;m not sure what you meant right<br/>
there.  Are you saying it won&#39;t do me much good until 2 more levels (level<br/>
10) and then it will always be a keeper?  Or are you saying after level 10 I<br/>
won&#39;t use it much?  <br/>

And finally Sylly wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At your age you can be hunting the first and mid parts of <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I&#39;d been liking West Karana.  Room to run, less lag.  I&#39;ll have to<br/>
check out Paw though.  Can&#39;t stand Blackburrow.  Is the loot in Paw similar<br/>
to that in BB?<br/>
<br/>
someone who&#39;s name I&#39;ve inadvertently deleted spoke thusly:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can get Menkes Tolbet in South Qeynos to make you Snake Fang <br/>
&gt; Necklaces and<br/>
&gt; re-sell those in the snake places in east commonlands for 1 <br/>

&gt; value goes way up when your buyer is sitting there with the <br/>
&gt; poison icon on<br/>
&gt; his screen &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THANK YOU!!  I thought I needed a cleric to cure poison.  This is very good<br/>
to know.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I was under the impression you had to keep them within the songs range<br/>
and keep lament in your mix of songs.  Guess not.  So, let&#39;s say I lament a<br/>
blue mob, pull a white mob off to the side & kill it, then decide to leave<br/>
the blue mob alone.  When the lament wears off, am I on it&#39;s hate list?  And<br/>
if I am, will it come across a zone to find me?<br/>

&gt; twice that of my bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just WISH her lull lined worked as effectively as lament <br/>
&gt; has for me since<br/>
&gt; the day I got it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So if lament is really that great, why are you higher level folks always<br/>
arguing about whether crowd control is best done with Lullaby, Chain, or<br/>
Charm?  Is it just that they hit multiple mobs at once?  Or are they better<br/>
than Lament even for single mobs?<br/>

<br/>
Thanks to everyone who&#39;s joined in on this thread.   Sorry to be such a<br/>
newbie.<br/>
