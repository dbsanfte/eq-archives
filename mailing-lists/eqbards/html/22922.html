Subject: [eqbards] Why did you start a Bard?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the Bardic class.  When<br/>
I first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find<br/>
their corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could<br/>
run faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve<br/>
been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible<br/>
once you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>
<br/>
So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>
<br/>
