When playing your bard in Norrath what is your favorite:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Day of the week to play: Those oh-so-rare weekdays when I take the day off <br/>
due to, say, working 11 or 12 days straight = )<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Time of day:  During said weekdays, it&#39;s nice to be on in the middle of the <br/>
day PST - low server load is a rarity for me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Longest stretch of continuous play: 16 hours (levels 22 and 23 on goblin <br/>
isle in the OOT)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Way to have game sounds:  Headphones, with sound realism cranked up... I <br/>
love all the random sounds such as madmen muttering to themselves<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Distance to sit from display: 18&quot;<br/>

the same room as my computers...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

so... jolly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Beverage (non-alcoholic): Dr. Pepper<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Beverage (alcoholic):  Guinness Stout, Newcastle Brown Ale, or any of a <br/>
variety of microbrews - beer is good food!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Health Food:  Pizza (hey, it can be good for you)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Junk Food: Pizza (ok, many people think it isn&#39;t good for you)<br/>
