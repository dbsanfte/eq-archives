 </span></blockquote>Khelan - I can honestly say that I&#39;ve been in the exact same spot ;)  As a <br/>
Guide (on TM), I used the Guide Levitate and Spirit of Norrath to do <br/>
exactly what you just described.  Very entertaining ;)  My favourite <br/>
Levitate and Fall spot, however, is the gigantic wizard spires in the <br/>
Dreadlands.  For sheer entertainment value once, I jumped off the spires, <br/>
sat and camped while slowly drifting downwards.  When I logged in next, I <br/>
was still a long way up ;)<br/>
