&gt; explored in there at all? On Cazic-Thule, we were killing everything<br/>
&gt; including the dracoliche, then they upgraded it.  That is pretty much<br/>
&gt; the end of the story, we all got slaughtered right as we came in and<br/>
&gt; took hours to get our corpses out.  &quot;People die hard in the plane of<br/>
&gt; fear&quot; really took its meaning.  <br/>
