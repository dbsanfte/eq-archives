<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965856014">I did post in the beginning.  (Under VarinEQ though)  Unfortunately others<br/>
have much more time to play than I and I am lvl 20.  I often dont have the<br/>
experience to answer the questions people have about the game.  My post did<br/>
not mean to attack anyone in particular, just to maybe get people to realize<br/>
what the list is transforming into.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Please refrain from posting this sort of rant. It&#39;s not someone I want<br/>
&gt; &gt; cluttering my inbox. Here&#39;s an example for you. If you go to a fine<br/>
&gt; &gt; restaurant, then order food, but dislike it intensely, complain to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; chef of it&#39;s quality, then demand your money back, do you go back there<br/>
&gt; &gt; the next night for dinner, hoping the chef has miraculously changed his<br/>
&gt; &gt; cooking style to suit you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just one point to make here. I&#39;ve been following this list since June or<br/>
&gt; so, and most of what I&#39;ve read from Kim and Ryan has been useful<br/>
&gt; discussion, analysis, and tips on how to play the bard. In fact, they<br/>
&gt; are probably 2 of the more prolific posters to the list and I usually<br/>
&gt; find the threads they post in to be very interesting. However, the only<br/>
&gt; posts I can recall reading from the recent complainers about their<br/>
&gt; latest postings are, the complaints.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In other words, if your only contribution to the list is to complain<br/>
&gt; when a couple of prolific posters deviate from what you want to hear,<br/>
&gt; are you really contributing? Is this list just here for your<br/>
&gt; entertainment in read only mode or is it here for everyone to share all<br/>
&gt; aspects of the bard class in this game, the good and the bad.<br/>
