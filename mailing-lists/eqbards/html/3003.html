<div id="ygrps-yiv-928068639">You&#39;re kidding, that&#39;s the ping rate?  No wonder I am amazed anyone can<br/>
twist more than two songs.  Last nite it was actually green all nite but was<br/>
still in the 300&#39;s to 400&#39;s.  I knew AOL stunk, but not that bad.  So if it<br/>
really is time for a new ISP any suggestions out there?  Who is good, since<br/>
mine is obviously far worse than I thought.<br/>

&gt; PL is usually 0%, but there is almost always a yellow number in the drop<br/>
&gt; column all the way to the right.  Its usually in the 600 range, but<br/>
&gt; sometimes goes red into the 1100&#39;s!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the number on the left if it changes color.  That is<br/>
your ping time.  Your computer is basically taking 0.6 sec to<br/>
1.1 sec to exchange information with the server.  I&#39;m frankly<br/>
amazed you&#39;re able to twist at all as I basically gave up when<br/>
UUNet was crapping out and giving me 600ms pings.  You&#39;re not<br/>
playing in Antarctica or Africa or something are you?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Get a new ISP.  (It might not really be your ISP&#39;s fault - it<br/>
could be their default route is through a flakey backbone far<br/>
upstream from them.  But the only way to fix it is to change<br/>
ISPs.)<br/>
<br/>
The number on the right is the data rate, and shouldn&#39;t really<br/>
matter unless it starts to get up beyond what your modem can<br/>
handle.<br/>
