<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; in upper guk, the squire if i  remember correctly. i camped that<br/>
&gt; SOB so long<br/>
&gt; and hadnt gotten a stupid fork, that and the troll belt. And as soon as i<br/>
&gt; leave, my buddies are running to do a corpse retrieval to lower<br/>
&gt; guk and got<br/>
&gt; both the fork and belt (warden)  for me. Talk about luck hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and the other night i was coming back from lower guk and killed the squire<br/>
&gt; and he had a fork on him, did a shout to the zone of a free fork, sadly it<br/>
&gt; rotted away since i allready had one<br/>
