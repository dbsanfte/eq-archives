<br/>

<br/>
This is a major change; as I&#39;m going full formula for all of the <br/>
songs (and I&#39;ve learned a heck of a lot over the past month.)   <br/>
Virtually every song has changed, and I&#39;ve got a lot more resolution <br/>
on levels and instruments.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also added the ability to select an instrument by name, and <br/>
Singing Short Sword Support (Select SSS for Voice instrument).<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS BETA<br/>
Please, if you can, do some testing of the numbers on this <br/>
spreadsheet, and please report any differences.  Posting on the <br/>
Concert Hall or e-mail me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqreed@...">eqreed@...</a>) is the best way to get <br/>
ahold of me.<br/>
<br/>
Note that if the AC is off by one, it&#39;s probably not a bug.  (Just <br/>
ask, and I&#39;ll go into my findings on AC, it&#39;s not as straight forward <br/>
as one would think).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy, and please let me know where it&#39;s wrong.  It still consider <br/>
this very beta and I make a lot of stupid mistakes /grin<br/>
