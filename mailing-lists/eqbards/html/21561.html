<div id="ygrps-yiv-101485628">Yes that&#39;s true but what if you inserted a command before the one to turn<br/>
off the song that could only be executed to turn one off and would fail to<br/>
turn a song on?  Like maybe...<br/>
<br/>
/Cast 1<br/>
/Pause 4<br/>
/Sit<br/>
/Cast 1<br/>
/Stand<br/>
/Cast 2<br/>
/Pause 4<br/>
/Sit<br/>
/Cast 2<br/>
/Stand<br/>
/Cast 3<br/>
/Pause 4<br/>

Rinse and Repeat?<br/>

Macro has no intelligence, so I would assume it would keep following it&#39;s <br/>
commands step by step.<br/>

perform a number of funtions with one key, same as weaving.<br/>

However, yes, missed notes would mess the timing up. I wonder if you could <br/>
then just press the &quot;social&quot; key again to interrupt the current macro or <br/>
whether you&#39;d be stuck waiting for your it to end? Something to definitely <br/>
test.<br/>

&gt;with this new &quot;pause&quot; command. It&#39;ll be fun to test!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;--------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*Pauses in Socials*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause<br/>
&gt;takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number<br/>
&gt;of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For example, a social consisting of:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/sit off<br/>
&gt;/cast 1<br/>
&gt;/pause 100<br/>
&gt;/sit on<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds<br/>
&gt;after you&#39;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as<br/>
&gt;another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the<br/>
&gt;pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the<br/>
&gt;same line.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For example:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/sit off<br/>
&gt;/pause 100,/cast 1<br/>
&gt;/sit on<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to<br/>
&gt;note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from<br/>
&gt;another, and MUST be specified first on the line.<br/>
