<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334528926">Misty can be seen in both zones. The dwarf is Crumpy Irontoe.  My theory is<br/>
that he is planted there to lure PC&#39;s who are doing the Head of Trumpy<br/>
(Bloodforge hammer? some hammer quest requires you to find and kill Trumpy<br/>
Irontoe - who is in South Qeynos) quest to their deaths.  They see an<br/>
Irontoe and immediately jump him only to find out he is red when Trumpy is<br/>
blue.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. sometimes I have seen Trumpy swimming off the dock in South Qey - wtf??<br/>
I wonder if you could pull him far enough away from the dock and kill him<br/>
under water and not get his pals and the guards agro&#39;d on you?<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. I solo&#39;d Kisdean Gixx for the first time - hehe he&#39;s a wuss now! Less<br/>
than a bub of hp.  Fear & Chain worked just fine.  Now I have his note and<br/>
need to learn a language to &#39;read&#39; it - hehe.  Had not seen him for a while<br/>
and took some revenge.<br/>

		Yes, from time to time Misty appears at the W Karanas-Q<br/>
Hills zone line and<br/>
		walks down the road to the Q Hills-Qeynos zone line where<br/>
she despawns.<br/>
		Several other traveling npc&#39;s make the same trip including<br/>
Talym Shoontar,<br/>
		Buzzlin Bornaham, and an Irontoe who is neither Tumpy or<br/>
Trumpy.  Talym can</div>
