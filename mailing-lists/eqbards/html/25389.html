<div id="ygrps-yiv-359061092">You can&#39;t dispel equipment.  Are jacinth (200pp each), diamonds (500pp<br/>
each), blue diamonds (2500pp each and going down), and regular resist<br/>
gear (dragon tooth choker, froglok crown, tranix crown, countless<br/>
others) etc. out of the reach of people who have reached level 60 (or<br/>
close) and go on the type of big raids we are talking about?<br/>
<br/>
When you lag or die, that means it is ok for the rest of your group to<br/>
die because they were relying on you for resists?  I&#39;m not saying bard<br/>
resists aren&#39;t nice, I&#39;m not saying they can not be used, I am saying<br/>
there are better ways.  Just as there are much better ways to battle<br/>
dispelling mobs.  Uber guilds do things these ways not because it is<br/>
&quot;their&quot; way, but because it is the most efficient and most successful<br/>
way.<br/>

Some people are equipped better than others.  &quot;Uber&quot; guilds get the<br/>
reputation they do is an assumption that everyone should play the way<br/>
they<br/>
do and the design of the game should be catered to the way they play.<br/>
<br/>
I would argue that good equipment is as much a determinant of time spent<br/>
playing as it is ability of the player.  Some of the best players I&#39;ve<br/>
seen<br/>
have some of the most mediocre equipment.<br/>
<br/>
So for many of us; particularly when fighting mobs that dispell - the<br/>
bards<br/>
resist songs are the difference between success and failure.<br/>
