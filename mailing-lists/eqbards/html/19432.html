<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654695592">Oh I totally agree.  I don&#39;t think the events start out as stupid.  I think<br/>
the actions of the 40+&#39;s that come in and destroy an event clearly far below<br/>
their level make them stupid.  I would have thought that Verant would have<br/>
found a way around this by now.  I can&#39;t imagine that the guides/gms don&#39;t<br/>
complain about it every time they run one.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is the players.  I just think the gm&#39;s need to be given<br/>
a tool to allow them to more easily prevent the players from causing<br/>
problems.<br/>
One of the events I was at was clearly intended to provide quite a challenge<br/>
for 20 or more characters of 15th level or so.  However two 40+ characters<br/>
came in and killed 90% of the event npc&#39;s.  I say 90% because some might<br/>
have escaped their wrath, though I personally didn&#39;t see any.<br/>

Uhh that&#39;s not true at all.  Casual gamers are generally still interested in<br/>
being able to participate in quests and adventures to attain neat or unique<br/>
items.  I would hazard that most &quot;Casual&quot; gamers would even like to some day<br/>
reach high levels.  Even Role Players like to reach high levels.<br/>
<br/>
All players should be able to participate in events.  The problem that I<br/>
have with most GM event&#39;s isn&#39;t that they are &quot;Stupid&quot;, however, it&#39;s that<br/>
unless the GM&#39;s get very &quot;evil&quot; and start punting players who interfere<br/>
there is no way for a dynamic event to keep the 50&#39;s from ruining the fun of<br/>
low level events.<br/>
<br/>
I was a Guide and I can tell you that MANY of the events are actually aimed<br/>
at those around level 15 to 35 or so.  The problem is  that whenever one of<br/>
those events kicks off the 50&#39;s waltz in and blast the actors to smitherines<br/>
because they think it may have neat stuff.  Which ruins the event for the<br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
Let me rephrase that:<br/>
It&#39;s not the GM&#39;s fault that the PLAYERS can&#39;t respect events enough not to<br/>
ruin it for themselves.<br/>
