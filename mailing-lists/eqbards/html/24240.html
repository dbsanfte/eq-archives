<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101678236">While not a bard related question, this seems like a good place to get some<br/>
feedback on this.<br/>
Elfson is 52 now (would be pretty far into it too, cept for 2 unrezzed death<br/>
this weekend, ugh).  I recently left my small, &quot;family&quot; guild (it was<br/>
disbanding due to loss of many players). I joined a smallish (12-20 people<br/>
on during prime play, almost all 45+) guild where some of my other former<br/>
guild mates had gone.  I like almost  everyone in the new guild, but I&#39;m not<br/>
thrilled with the way the guild does some things (I don&#39;t want to get into<br/>
specifics because there are a few Veeshan bards here and don&#39;t want to start<br/>
any trouble).  However, I basically only get to do things with guildies once<br/>
at week at most, so essentially I&#39;m still stuck in the same problem (I end<br/>
up in pick up groups in Karnors most nights) I had in my family guild. (I<br/>
was the highest lvl in the guild when I left).<br/>
<br/>
So what should I do?  Leave the guild and try to join a big powerful guild<br/>
(where I won&#39;t like many of the people, but at least I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>
guild stuff most of the time I play)?  Pretty much give up being able to<br/>
play after 50, and just play my cleric in my Thrusday night group (39 now)?<br/>
Something else?<br/>
