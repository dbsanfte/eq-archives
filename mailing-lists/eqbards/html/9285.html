<br/>
Last night I decided I&#39;m going to stick my head into Lower Guk (LG) and see<br/>
if perhaps I can&#39;t loot a Shin Gauntlet or set of Shin Greaves for the<br/>
Lambent Armor quest.  At 28th I have no intention of fighting in there, as<br/>
we&#39;ve all heard the horror stories from the folks that are 40+.  Having<br/>
worked a monk up to level 23 prior to joining the One True Path of bardness,<br/>
I thought I had a pretty good feel for Upper Guk (UG) having hunted there<br/>
for mesh.  Boy was I wrong.<br/>
<br/>
UG is freakin&#39; huge - much bigger than my poor misinformed monk had ever<br/>
thought it was.  It also holds a wealth of mobs that gave great experience<br/>
for me at level 28 and my other party members up to 32.  My 32nd Necro<br/>
friend was impressed with the amount of experience he was getting.  The real<br/>
kicker is that none of this stuff was camped.  We walked right into a great<br/>
little camping spot and proceeded to make great exp and decent cash<br/>
(occasional 2pp drops) and never encountered another soul.  Died only once<br/>
when a train of 20 or so frogs sprinted into our room for no apparent<br/>
reason - we had had NO runners, no AE songs/spells, nothing.  In fact we<br/>
hadn&#39;t even been fighting for several minutes.  We all decided that they<br/>
must have been agro on someone else and come to us, or a bug or something.<br/>
It was weird.  Even still, thanks to bard power I was the only casualty.<br/>
When they sprinted in I immediately fired off a Screech and 20 of them<br/>
turned and fled.  The monk feigned, the Necros gated and the frogs came back<br/>
and killed me.  Mission accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
LG was surprisingly fun too.  I zoned in and /ooc&#39;d &quot;How often to Shin<br/>
Greaves and Shin Gauntlets drop and can a humble 28th level bardess please<br/>
loot them for a quest?&quot;  The response was the they dropped &quot;Too damned<br/>
often&quot; and that I should have one of each in around an hour.  So I sat in LG<br/>
hugging the zone like a little schoolgirl, waiting patiently and /ooc<br/>
reminding people I was looking every 10 minutes or so.  I saw a 35th Druid<br/>
hurt and sitting near the zone so I grouped with him to heal him up.<br/>
Surprisingly we stayed grouped and started killing undead froggies near the<br/>
zone - and it turned out to not be that hard.  They were yellow to me at<br/>
28th, and green to just about everyone else in the zone, so he and I had<br/>
them all to ourselves.  I gained a bubble of experience and killed for and<br/>
looted my own Shin Guantlets and Greaves!  Even better!  I didn&#39;t even come<br/>
close to dying.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the moral is &quot;Don&#39;t forget Upper Guk&quot; and for those in their mid or<br/>
high 20s, &quot;Go into Lower Guk with a friend or two and kill the lower level<br/>
stuff near the zone for your own Shin Guantlets and Greaves.&quot;<br/>
