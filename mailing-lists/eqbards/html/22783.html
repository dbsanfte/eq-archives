<b>Subject:</b> Looking for place to hunt <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764058945">I have hit level 20 and I need to get some good feedback.  I want to <br/>
do some research on what people feel as a good place to hunt.  I will <br/>
have a LOT of time on my hands in the coming winter months.  The time <br/>
of day I tend to hunt threre aren&#39;t too many people online so <br/>
grouping usually isn&#39;t an option.  Any ideas on where I can solo?<br/>
<br/>
PS I am posting this to several groups so my apologies if you see <br/>
this more than once.<br/>
