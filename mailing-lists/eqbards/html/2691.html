<div id="ygrps-yiv-783931269">Spent more than an hour running around Highpass and Highold looking for some<br/>
Goldensong woman.  I finally growled that she could not possibly exist and<br/>
burned the mail.  Don&#39;t know why I spent so long on something that would<br/>
garner me nothing.  I noticed there was a new Wood Elf in Rivervale wanting<br/>
mail delivered, and after about ten minutes saying different combinations of<br/>
&quot;I will deliver the mail to Freeport,&quot; I finally hit on the right sentence!<br/>
Then I burned that too.<br/>

&gt;Just don&#39;t stack the quests.  I did that and by the time I made it from<br/>
&gt;Kelethin to Freeport, all I got was a &#39;Thank you very much&#39; instead of<br/>
&gt;the adjustments, xp, and cash.<br/>
