<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Has anyone noticed that the new bard song uses more mana since the last<br/>
&gt; patch, last night in Sol B King room our group was holding all 3 rooms<br/>
&gt; (whole zone was empty). So we had non stop action and at times there were<br/>
&gt; 3/4 kobolds coming at us that agro from other rooms, I was using charm and<br/>
&gt; after a 4 kobold fight my mana was down 2 bubs. I sat and med but it didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; regen fast enough, looks as though this song now uses 20 mana per cast<br/>
&gt; instead of the original 5 mana. Ok ok, you must be wondering why I am using<br/>
&gt; the level 39 charm song on kobolds? Well, some Solusek Kobolds are too<br/>
&gt; high, so I just use the level 39 song to avoid this....we was also pulling<br/>
&gt; bats/bugs so it&#39;s handy to have for that too. It looks as though this song<br/>
&gt; is gonna have to be used in rations....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I have.  I tried to solo some seafuries last night for awhile.  Before it took me about minimum of 5<br/>
or 6 furies before I would be down a bubble of mana.  Last night I was done a bubble and a half after the<br/>
first one.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I noticed certain mobs with higher resist rates.  Doing the IGs pre-Vox before the patch, I was<br/>
sticking about 80% of my charms.  Last night I could only stick about 20% of my charms on the IGs.  Once<br/>
I finally did stick a charm it did seem that it was extremely easy to stick it again though... it was the<br/>
initial charm that was sooooo tough.  Because of all the resists, my mana was half gone before the first<br/>
wave of IGs was done.<br/>
<br/>
I still think the song will be great for limited crowd control and I see the mana thingy as a way to keep<br/>
us from going out there and trying to solo.<br/>
