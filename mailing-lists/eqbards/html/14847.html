Jerrilia, <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let the talk here going on between the high level bards give you the<br/>
wrong idea about the bard class.  We absolutely love playing the bard class<br/>
and most of us would probably agree that it is the best choice we could have<br/>
made in terms of enjoying the game.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, these high level players have been playing for about 9<br/>
months (at least) longer than you and the game has gone through a lot of<br/>
changes during that time.  We all tend to get on rants from time to time but<br/>
fact of the matter is, we do it because we love our bards.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me introduce myself.  I&#39;m a new player to Everquest <br/>
&gt; (received it for<br/>
&gt; Christmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>
&gt; shamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I subscribed to this mailing list a few days ago and so far have just<br/>
&gt; seen postings that talk about the higher levels.  I&#39;ve also <br/>
&gt; noticed that<br/>
&gt; many of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My questions: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What <br/>
&gt; items should I<br/>
&gt; be pursuing in the near future?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard <br/>
&gt; route?  What<br/>
&gt; makes the bard fun?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt;                              walked a mile in his shoes.  That way, <br/>
&gt;                              when he finds out what you said about <br/>
&gt; 			     him, you&#39;re a mile away, and he&#39;s barefoot.<br/>
