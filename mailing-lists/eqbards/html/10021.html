&gt; &gt; I tried to Chain/Fear Choon the other night at level 31.  My Fear just<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t seem to be taking hold on this guy.  It was like he was out of <br/>
&gt;range<br/>
&gt; &gt; (no resist message), but he was hitting me for 60s and 70s.  I dutifully<br/>
&gt; &gt; stood at his feet Screeching while he pummeled me trying to get it to <br/>
&gt;take<br/>
&gt; &gt; hold.  Screech *finally* worked and he turned and fled.  I had exactly <br/>
&gt;12<br/>
&gt; &gt; HPs left at that point, so I decided chasing after him was probably a <br/>
&gt;bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe this &quot;song isn&#39;t resisted but has no effect&quot; bug affects<br/>
&gt;more than just Pixie Strike...<br/>
