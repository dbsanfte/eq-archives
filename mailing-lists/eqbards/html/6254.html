<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530962154">very true.  its all lower guk, sol B, or twinking characters like you said.<br/>
had a lot of fun with Fire Giants a few nights one week though, all the way<br/>
up to and including warlord skarlon.  got me the first mithril arms on the<br/>
server =)  and then the Nagafen kill.  but pretty slow since then,<br/>
definitely need a Fear repatch and Hate to open.  i know a lot of people not<br/>
yet 50 are upset about fear too, as the 50s are crowding their space now =)<br/>

&gt; haven&#39;t been able to play long enough to be able to organise <br/>
&gt; a party to<br/>
&gt; even try. Also, when I do log in, seems like most of my friends are<br/>
&gt; either playing second characters or out hunting lower level mobs to<br/>
&gt; twink said characters. Since the last fear plane nerfing the amount of<br/>
&gt; things for L50 chars to do is pretty dismal. </span></blockquote></div>
