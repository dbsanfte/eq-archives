&gt;   Only on dragon raids and plane trips, you&#39;ll notice.  I cannot stress<br/>

&gt;   I&#39;ve realized that the strain of making levels is lifted, and you can<br/>
&gt;   enjoy the game much more.  Again, that&#39;s my take on it as people<br/>
&gt;   often like to disagree with me.  But there is no excitement after<br/>
&gt;   you&#39;ve done it all, in my opinion.<br/>

Its not the final destination I&#39;m in it for, I want to have fun getting there.  And<br/>
dragon raids are FUN!  I went on my first around the beginning of 45.  I&#39;m<br/>
still working my way through 45 &lt;sigh&gt;, and got to help kill Naggy last night.<br/>
At the last Vox raid, I got *incredibly* lucky and won the roll on a Runed<br/>
Bolster Belt.  I&#39;ve made a bunch of 50 friends.  (And okay, a few enemies<br/>
since I won that belt. :) )  Right now I consider myself a junior member of the<br/>
dragon run teams.  I do exactly what people tell me, watch and learn, and<br/>
hope I don&#39;t get hit by much.  Once its over, I go back and kill kobolds for a<br/>
while and work on leveling for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I guess theres two ways you can do it.  You can look at leveling as a chore you<br/>
have to go through to win the magic bullet that is level 50, slogging through<br/>
kobold after kobold, bug after bug, or you can do your best to make leveling<br/>
fun and interesting by breaking it up with lots of non-leveling activities  such<br/>
as dragon runs, romances, newbie helping, or whatever...  I know which way<br/>
I&#39;m doing it.<br/>
