<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244927492">Here is an interesting thing to think about.  I have a Higher lvl enchanter<br/>
on a PvP server.  My brother logs on as a monster in and tells me (we are in<br/>
the same house) what zone he is in.  I find him, charm him and then buff him<br/>
to no end.  Wait till charm wears off and watch him go rabid on unsuspecting<br/>
newbies. Sounds like it could be a problem to me.<br/>

Well, the patch message itself is interesting enough (playing monsters? I <br/>
am SO there!)  but there are also some Bard-related notes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon. Now if the bard has his Epic <br/>
and an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect will take <br/>
precedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That should please those who&#39;ve gotten it.<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
&quot;Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  I&#39;ve been working with a piercing weapon as my primary for a while...<br/>
