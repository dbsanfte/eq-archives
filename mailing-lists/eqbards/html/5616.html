&gt; <br/>
&gt; So it&#39;s also going to take LONGER to cast DoT spells?<br/>

&gt; So in other words, a group cosisting of a wizard and a<br/>
&gt; Shaman for example.. The wizard casts root on the mob<br/>
&gt; and then the Shaman poisons it. Darn, sorry - you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; not close enough to the monster, your DoT isn&#39;t going<br/>
&gt; to work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If Brad is correct, then rooting it would cause the DoT to do<br/>
damage.<br/>

&gt; poison stop? I bet I can tell you the answer to that<br/>
&gt; one rather quickly. Poison is poison. It&#39;s in the body,<br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t go away just because you have to chase<br/>
&gt; something. I don&#39;t normally kite (how boring) but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; totally against them changing the spells this drastically<br/>
&gt; for everyone just because some people do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, to force a balanced discussion on it, I always thought<br/>
Verant should&#39;ve changed the AI so the spellcasting monsters<br/>
with DoTs would kite players (kinda like those annoying<br/>
archers and witches in Diablo).  Then whatever the players ask<br/>
be done to mob kiting, do the same to player kiting.<br/>
