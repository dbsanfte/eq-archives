&gt; I regretfully tell you that I was a couple of levels below level 15 when the<br/>
&gt; patch that nerfed Lullaby went in, so I&#39;ve never seen what it could do<br/>
&gt; pre-nerf.  My experience with lullaby even at level 15 was that &quot;it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; great taunt song&quot;.  I&#39;ve never been able to reliably crowd control to this<br/>
&gt; date.  I guess when I get charm in four more levels I&#39;ll be able to control<br/>
&gt; a crowd of three, but if pixie strike is as bugged as Lullaby I guess that<br/>
&gt; will be the best I will ever do.<br/>

in the Aviak city and I had rooks nodding off left and right when we got in<br/>
trouble.  I was the lowest level up there at 18 and was not using any<br/>
instruments.  The sleeping rooks would occasionally wake up swing at me then<br/>
nod back off.  I just had to be sure I told the others to leave them alone and<br/>
let them sleep.  The rooks were red to me.  At one time we had a Harrier that<br/>
we were attacking and 2 sleeping rooks.  Sure sounds to me like it is working<br/>
properly.<br/>
