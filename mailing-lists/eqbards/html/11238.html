&gt;I would like to make one sidebar comment:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the monks sit-in is the last one that will have any effect, either<br/>
&gt;with the players or with Verant.  There was a Cleric sit-in on Fennin Ro<br/>
&gt;last night of about 50 or so level 1 clerics.  I can assure you *everyone*<br/>
&gt;in the zone was very angry with these clerics.  They were lagging the zone<br/>
&gt;horribly and spamming the zone (intentionally and unintentionally) with<br/>
&gt;shouts and ooc.  If we want to make a point with Verant, we need to try and<br/>
&gt;find a way to do so that doesn&#39;t penalize other players&#39; game experience.<br/>
&gt;Verant won&#39;t sit still for that.<br/>

little there.... sing to the news guys.. sing to the news groups...<br/>
