<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140884569">My small 12-member guild is merging with a much larger guild (after merger<br/>
and a bunch of new recruits should be close to 80) that likes to have guild<br/>
events with a lot of Dueling.  I&#39;ve never done this before.<br/>
<br/>
	Saturday we had 3 6-man groups duel.  Guessing my way through this - I<br/>
twisted Elemental and Guardian - to keep our team from getting Nukes etc to<br/>
land on us - and Selos - running around in circles to prevent the tanks from<br/>
landing blows on me.  This was VERY successful.  A ranger gave up trying to<br/>
chase me and peppered me with arrows - but it didn&#39;t really do all that much<br/>
damage.  I would also run into a fracas where there were pets pounding on a<br/>
teammate of mine and would fire off screech.<br/>
<br/>
	This got our group to be in a very good shape for the end-game - but then I<br/>
wasn&#39;t in a good spot for that - as there wasn&#39;t much casting going on.  A<br/>
Necro was hiding in bones form in a firepot medding while her pet was<br/>
fighting someone.  I decided to try to go after the necro and tank her - but<br/>
she was good at fearing me - and while I tried to screech her pet - I got<br/>
some resists.  Her pet ultimately killed me - with a remaining tank (from<br/>
the other team helping out).<br/>
<br/>
	Anywho, I&#39;m curious of advice from other Bards who may be more experienced<br/>
at this as far as good tactics for duels.<br/>
