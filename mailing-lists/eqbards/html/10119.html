<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905277782">I hate the damn things myself, I refuse to ever go back to Runnyeye.  Every<br/>
time I&#39;ve gone there I&#39;ve died at least 3 times.  I seem to have a lot more<br/>
success in Perma and Sol A though.  Bear in mind that we haven&#39;t been to the<br/>
king side yet and all the mobs we&#39;re facing would probably be green to you,<br/>
but a good group is the key element.  And anyone who wants to try this<br/>
place, one thing -- MAKE DAMN SURE YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT CAN ROOT!!!  Chains<br/>
works wonders here.  Its the difference between big rewards and big death<br/>
tolls.  Also, I know they are a relatively underappreciated class, but our<br/>
rogue is the man in these places!  With his hide and sneak skill he keeps us<br/>
from running headlong into masses of baddies.  He has become our number one<br/>
asset for dungeon crawls.  I won&#39;t go into a dungeon without him anymore.<br/>

P.S. Kitasi, I forgot to tell you, make sure your puller uses ranged weps to<br/>
pull, I&#39;ve had a couple of the gobs (flame and fire) here get me with<br/>
backstabs for 120 plus.<br/>

&gt; Sol A and Runnyeye are the worst, Permafrost isn&#39;t quite so bad.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh thank god,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     After being the world&#39;s poorest bard for 22 levels, I must<br/>
&gt; &gt; say that I have found the greatest place I have ever been for<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience and cash.  If any of you level 30 and under bards are<br/>
&gt; &gt; in need of a fun time and a good place, I would suggest Solusek&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Eye.  In the last week, I have gone from level 22 to almost 25,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and made about 1400pp (no kidding - I know you big guys are<br/>
&gt; &gt; saying ~yawn~, but I&#39;ve never had more than 100pp in the bank<br/>
&gt; &gt; hehe).  I am now the proud owner of 2 Obsidian Scimitars, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; drakescale belt, a pair of Kobold hide boots, and an obsidian shard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     My guild and I have been exploring the place for a week now<br/>
&gt; &gt; and we love it!  Of course, we&#39;ve only gotten as far as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Foreman&#39;s room but we&#39;ll get a little further after a while.  Our<br/>
&gt; &gt; group was myself, a 25 rogue, a 25 monk, a 27 ranger, a 26<br/>
&gt; &gt; paladin, and a 26 warrior.  So far I&#39;ve only died once, which is<br/>
&gt; &gt; incredible for me.  Hell, I died getting there (forgot to check<br/>
&gt; &gt; the time and ran smack through the middle of Kithicor at 1 am --<br/>
&gt; &gt; you writhe in pain....LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  I have yet to see a<br/>
&gt; &gt; champion or a mage other than on the ranger&#39;s tracking, but we<br/>
&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t gotten that direction yet.  We will, poppa needs some<br/>
&gt; &gt; brand new shoes and sleeves, as soon as we level a few more times.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Anyway, just a suggestion for those of you who are looking<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a nice place to hunt.  Although you&#39;ll need a good group, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; place is a blast so far.  There are lots of &quot;safe&quot; places to pull<br/>
&gt; &gt; to once you fight your way to them, most are right next to Sol B<br/>
&gt; &gt; zone lines.  And so far, I&#39;ve encountered no warping bugs for<br/>
&gt; &gt; MOBS, and no Z-Axis problems, I have no trouble using Lullaby at<br/>
&gt; &gt; all.  It has saved our asses more than once, I know one time we<br/>
&gt; &gt; pulled a fire gob shaman, 2 flame gobs, and 2 cinder gobs when<br/>
&gt; &gt; Singe showed up!  We barely eeked that one out, but damn it felt good!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry to ramble on, I&#39;m just in awe of this place!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S. Of course you know that as soon as I post this I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go back and die there 25 times tonight, Murphy&#39;s Law.  Doh!<br/>
