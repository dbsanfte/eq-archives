<div id="ygrps-yiv-778718245">ok, that&#39;s different.  what i was trying to get across is that an intrument<br/>
slot alone will not fix the problem, as there would have to be something<br/>
else added to specify whether we want to use weapons and sing or use<br/>
instrument and play, since we are now basically holding everything in a<br/>
slot.  now though, instead of having to switch from weapons to instrument,<br/>
we have to push an additional button.  an improvement to be sure, and worth<br/>
suggesting, though possibly more than they want to implement.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d like to see it so that if we select &quot;instrument&quot; it auto <br/>
&gt; switches to<br/>
&gt; our hands - just like a bow does - we could still fight just <br/>
&gt; like we do<br/>
&gt; now, weaponless - and still sing, the equipped instrument is <br/>
&gt; only used if<br/>
&gt; that particular button is pressed - just like for bows.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And yes - we still might need to switch instruments - but <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a one for<br/>
&gt; one deal - not two for one and back again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love my bard - and I&#39;ve messed a bit with other classes - <br/>
&gt; we are the ONLY<br/>
&gt; one with this high a twitch factor. </span></blockquote></div>
