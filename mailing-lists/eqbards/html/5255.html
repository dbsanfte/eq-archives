<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008779814">Hehe, I would LOVE AI monsties who:<br/>
<br/>
play for 28 hours with no sleep<br/>
<br/>
play while drinking alcoholic beverages<br/>
<br/>
fall asleep on their keyboards<br/>
<br/>
get up and go to the little lizard&#39;s room and hope no campers come by while<br/>
they are afk<br/>
<br/>
jump into the melee and forget to equip their weps<br/>
<br/>
run out of food and drink and beg their pals for some<br/>
<br/>
get bored and chat with other monsties in other zones then get jumped by the<br/>
next camper &#39;spawn&#39;<br/>
<br/>
get into a second fight right after a really tough first fight and tell<br/>
their group - sorry wife/hubbie came home and I have to camp<br/>
<br/>
have to run nekkid back to where they died before they get their stuffs and<br/>
buffs back<br/>
<br/>
Ya, we need more monsties like players &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sylly Songsynger<br/>
Bard of the 21th song<br/>
a.k.a. Robo-Bard<br/>
Selling Second-hands Swords and Stabbers<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>

		Did I mention I hate it when they<br/>
		don&#39;t give monsters the same limitations that they give<br/>
		players?</div>
