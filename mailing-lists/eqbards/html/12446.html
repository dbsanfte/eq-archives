<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590434090">Okay, I&#39;ve got to disagree with this one too.  I&#39;ve been on about 15-20<br/>
dragon raids now, and we can fairly reliably kill the big suckers with 24<br/>
people now.  Often without any casualties.<br/>
<br/>
On lag, I agree here.  Dragons seem to cause a lot of lag, I assume because<br/>
of their size, but I don&#39;t really know.  I find it extremely difficult to<br/>
twist 2 songs here, so tend to stick to just one.  I&#39;ll use Elemental<br/>
Rhythems with  a MM drum.  I&#39;ve tried twisting Elemental and Guardian, but<br/>
I&#39;ve found rather than risk one of them dropping, its best just to stick<br/>
with Elemental.  If your lag is good enough that you can twist 2, go for it.<br/>
I&#39;m jealous.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the kicker, and I can&#39;t stress this enough.  Fire/Cold resists are<br/>
EVERYTHING.  If you&#39;ve got a base resist of 25, you&#39;re not even allowed to<br/>
come becuase you&#39;ll be more of a liability than an asset.  Standing rule is<br/>
to have a FR/CR base of at least 80 UNBUFFED.  With resist cold/fire and<br/>
bard song on top of this, you should have something in the range of 180<br/>
CR/FR.  Even this isn&#39;t great.  Over 200 is better.  I&#39;m currently in the<br/>
220 range, and I&#39;m shooting for 255.  Its true that you&#39;ll still be taking<br/>
almost full damage at 125 resist.  People see this and say &quot;resists don&#39;t<br/>
matter&quot; but they can&#39;t be more wrong.  Low resists don&#39;t matter.  High<br/>
resists are the difference between a successful dragon raid and a 2 hour<br/>
corpse recovery.<br/>
<br/>
A buffed Magic Resist of 150 at level 50 has been enough to resist every<br/>
single fear thrown against us.  I have NEVER been feared with a MR in this<br/>
range.  Since we can achieve this 150 with only Elemental playing, there&#39;s<br/>
not a real need for me to twist in a second song anyway.<br/>
<br/>
This is a bit of a hot topic for me.  Currently my guild (and our allies)<br/>
are the only people on our server that can reliable take down a dragon.  We<br/>
don&#39;t keep secrets.  We try to explain to other people what needs to be done<br/>
to make one of these events successful.  Yet still people show up saying<br/>
&quot;anyone got any extra resist gear?&quot; or &quot;is 40 resist high enough?&quot;  These<br/>
people, without fail, time after time, are the first to die.<br/>

  It&#39;s not worth your time to twist those songs.  Here&#39;s why from<br/>
  my limited experience in both planes, and inside info from<br/>
  other servers dragon raids:<br/>
<br/>
  1) Lag.  You will be lucky to even get twisting in.<br/>
     With my P3-450, 128MB, TNT2 Ultra machine with all options<br/>
     off... detail, pc names, effects, my misses, your misses,<br/>
     your hits, all spell, all song, I still got lagged something<br/>
     horrible.  It&#39;s the location server trying to update 30 people<br/>
     in a very tight area, nothing you can do about it.<br/>
<br/>
  2) You will get more attention than you wanted, starting and stopping<br/>
     a song draws attention, an adhorrent thought so as it tripled me<br/>
     for 135.  Cazic Thule thought so when I twisted and he clobbered<br/>
     me in the 170s.  That said, oh well, you gotta twist, so twist<br/>
     the right stuff ;)<br/>
<br/>
  3) Ok, so you are gonna lag and get beat up a little.  You still<br/>
     need to twist.  Here&#39;s the kicker.  Your COLD/HEAT bonus from<br/>
     those songs doesn&#39;t do much.  AE Breath will hit for normal if<br/>
     your resistance is 25 or 125.  Take it for what it&#39;s worth,<br/>
     and you may not believe it, but it&#39;s confirmed.  Now, you may partial<br/>
     resist the dmg, but it&#39;s barely accountable to the resist level.<br/>
     The biggest single problem is the AE fear when doing dragons.  <br/>
     The best save vs. that fear is being L50... a fear on you even <br/>
     with MR over 200 at L40 will stick.<br/>
<br/>
  4) Your damage counts.  I&#39;ve seen so many people say, Argh!  He<br/>
     only had a sliver left.  Think if you added your 400 - 500 dmg<br/>
     into the attack?  You&#39;ve got weapons, use em!<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh wait... hehe, L41 is mystic shielding.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant was smart in this way, they gave you a song that boosts<br/>
  MR by 60 (at L50) without using instruments or twisting songs.<br/>
  Verses of Victory is amazing... ac20, str30, dex30, atkspeed inc.<br/>
<br/>
  I never went on dragon trips because you need the right people<br/>
  for the job.  Extra people or wrong people just clutter up the <br/>
  scenery and lag everyone.  Back in the day we only had like 40<br/>
  L50&#39;s, now we have over 200.  It&#39;s just a matter of picking and<br/>
  choosing.  <br/>
<br/>
  No disrespect, cause I love ya a lot girl, but L40 bards aren&#39;t<br/>
  cut out for dragon raids, unless the server is scrapped for people<br/>
  at the time of the raid.  Simply because the songs you really<br/>
  need are higher up, and the level difference really hurts your<br/>
  DragonFear resist and ability to strike the monster.  As much <br/>
  as I wanted to go to do them in the past, I had to defer the<br/>
  work to someone more experienced.  Which is exactly what I did.<br/>
<br/>
  Bust your ass so we can fight together at full power (L50) again.<br/>
