&gt;I talked to Vlad of Avatars of Doom on Karana awhile back. He<br/>
&gt;said should like J.C. said, they&#39;ve made the planes extremly<br/>
&gt;hard now. Creatures backstabbing for 400 damage when you try<br/>
&gt;to portal in. Getting hit can teleport you to other parts of<br/>
&gt;the zone. He did mention before they made it impossible to get<br/>
&gt;it about some of the armor. Hopefully he&#39;ll send it on in as<br/>
&gt;well as the rest of his guildmates. Paladin armor is blue.<br/>
&gt;Cleric armor is purple. Bard armor is yellow. Druid is green<br/>
&gt;                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>
&gt;chain. Ranger is green plate. Shaman is grey (not sure).<br/>

&gt;Yellow?  Why yellow?  I feel a barrage of coward jokes and<br/>
&gt;have-a-nice-day jokes coming...<br/>

Actually the armour is much more gold looking than yellow and it looks very<br/>
nice actually. We found a pair of golden arms from the vile plane off of a<br/>
boogyman (yes thats right, a boogyman). They are bard only, had excellent<br/>
ac, but gave int as their stat. As far as i always thought int sucks for a<br/>
bard so the arms are not that great, besides the pretty gold sheen and the<br/>
nice ac. I have heard all kinds of rumors about the plane, from you being<br/>
instantly teleported the moment you set your foot in the door by Cazic<br/>
Thule himself to a random location to other assorted garbage. Everytime i<br/>
have set foot through that gate i have had no problem as long as i dont<br/>
move. We had a very succesful fear expedition that involved 23 people, all<br/>
lvl 40-50. We got more than a few stunningly cool pieces of equipment and<br/>
had a very fun time with nobody dying. Thats not to say the plane isnt<br/>
freaking rough, there are all manors of things hell bent on seperating you<br/>
from your group. Tentacle Tormenters that will belt you 300 feet straight<br/>
up (some people taking 700pts of dmg when they finally fell back down),<br/>
Scarelings that will teleport you randomly away, and little bitty toadies<br/>
that like to inflict fear upon you (a more deadly spell in that zone i dont<br/>
think exists). We slaughtered a slew of strange beasties before we finally<br/>
decided to call it a night and evac&#39;d out (yes there is a portal out, no<br/>
you would most likely die trying to get to it).<br/>
<br/>
I was expecting to see some songs work differently but never did find one.<br/>
I expected the appalling screech to have an interesting twist to it but<br/>
everything worked according to the book for me. I especially got a kick of<br/>
fearing the boogyman and something called the fright. 8)</div>
