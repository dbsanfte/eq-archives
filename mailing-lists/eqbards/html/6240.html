&gt; Unfortunately one of the above will often be true. For me going from two to <br/>
&gt; three songs was just a matter of practice,  but wour machine/connection may <br/>
&gt; well set the limit lower. As for twisting 4 songs...John how do you do it??? <br/>
&gt; Most impressive! Do you stop the songs before the effect message shows? Ive <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, for the most part you anticipate when the next song will<br/>
kick in and stop/start without watching for the message.  I<br/>
suppose a musical background helps, although I&#39;ve managed to<br/>
do it watching for messages as well (sometimes being thrown<br/>
off by &quot;begins to cast a spell&quot; messages).<br/>
<br/>
That said, I would swear Verant has slightly decreased the<br/>
duration of our songs, which may well have made weaving 4<br/>
impossible.  Lately, I&#39;ve been having more trouble than I<br/>
remember keeping just 3 songs up (and not due to missed notes<br/>
this time).  I haven&#39;t tried 4 songs in a while, guess I&#39;ll<br/>
try it tonight.<br/>
