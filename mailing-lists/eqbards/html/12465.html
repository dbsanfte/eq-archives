<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450454657"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Might add shaman to this list, they have a lot of different<br/>
&gt; spells, and deciding when to cast which isn&#39;t the easiest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I most definitely do not envy their job.  So many spells, so <br/>
  little mana.  And everyone has got to have X buff, beg beg beg.<br/>
  It would drive me nuts.<br/>
