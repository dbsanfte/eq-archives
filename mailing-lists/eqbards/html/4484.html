<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444656015">It sounds to me like you were grouped..... Since all the songs you mentioned <br/>
have a Non-Party AoE. Except Bellow which is targeted.<br/>

PS I did the same thing dueling a Shaman friend of mine.  I could not figure <br/>
out why I was getting spanked by a shaman 3 levels below me LOL.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I cant get this song to do squat. On mobs it will pulse with the animation<br/>
&gt;that looks like selo&#39;s accelerando on us, and this will irritate the<br/>
&gt;creature causing them to attack me but thats all i can tell. I tried<br/>
&gt;dualing a friend and it wouldnt even pulse on them, though it was<br/>
&gt;irritating the snakes and bats around me. For that matter, i couldnt even<br/>
&gt;get the dissonance to hurt them. Bellows hurt them, and i could wack all<br/>
&gt;day on them with my weapons, but no aoe song hit them. Didnt try fear now<br/>
&gt;that i think of it... this happened before todays patch but after the last<br/>
&gt;patch. Anybody know what was going on here? I am going to try this again<br/>
&gt;today after this patch and see what happens... </span></blockquote></div>
