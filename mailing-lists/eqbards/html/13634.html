<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192721905">Um most of lower guk is green and your right it&#39;s about loot not exp. Even<br/>
so ct in most spots is not green at 30 I know people who were there until<br/>
40. Unrest the basement is also good for exp at 30. Some parts in guk are<br/>
good for 30 to.  Hell  you forgot some dungeons like Sol A which is baren.<br/>
Or mm same thing. Fact of the matter is your argument is off somewhat<br/>
because there are zones at your level exmpty while at mine their aren&#39;t any<br/>
that are even low.As for Ice giants inside perma the spawn rate is 4 hours.<br/>
Besides the fact that they are usually camped.<br/>
<br/>
Again it&#39;s not as crodwed at the lower levels how else would I be playing a<br/>
21 shaman fine? CT is empty on E&#39;ci most of the time. Why because most 30-39<br/>
people are in lower guk. Hell us high levels didn&#39;t go to guk until 40+.<br/>
Again there are far less high level zones and consdiering that most people<br/>
are getting up their 40&#39;s now they need to concentrate on it.<br/>

&gt;&gt; You have multiple dungeons. I don&#39;t care for a change of pace all I want<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; be less crowded and they can change that with more zones. You guys have<br/>
&gt;&gt; so many options of zone that it&#39;s not even funny but lets say for 46+ we<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; sol b. So all we really have is 3 zones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can still do Permafrost over the Vox&#39;s lair section, plenty of IGs<br/>
&gt;to go around<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now for 30ish people you have a variety of outdoor zones, for dungeons<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; have permafrost, CT, Unrest, MM, Sol A, Guk, Lower Guk, Sol B. See the<br/>
&gt;&gt; problem?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No I don&#39;t since CT, Unrest, Upper Guk and most of Permafrost greens out<br/>
&gt;at the 30s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I play a mid level char a 50 char and a low level char and there are no<br/>
&gt;&gt; problems with the low or mid levle chars. High level chars there is a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>problem<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; though. It&#39;s not like were complaining we need a change of pace we want<br/>
&gt;&gt; something new for the hell of it we don&#39;t but you are. Seriously what<br/>
 </span></blockquote>problems<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; do you have at mid or low levels?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m on a far less crowded server then most (peak last Sat night was 1921<br/>
&gt;people) but the over crowding is felt down at the lower levels just as<br/>
&gt;much as at the higher ones. And because the crowding is so bad, all<br/>
&gt;those 45+ players with nothing to do are creating new characters just so<br/>
&gt;they can have something to do. So the problem has trickled down quite<br/>
&gt;nicely so it really has affected us all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Not many high levels are plagued with overcrowded. Hell I love the lower<br/>
 </span></blockquote>guk<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; zone and I&#39;d be happy if they just duplicated the zone a bunch of times.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Seriously though how about you list me a couple of problems you low mid<br/>
 </span></blockquote>levels<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On my server, Lower is always packed.  But then again, isn&#39;t most of<br/>
&gt;Lower Guk green for you also; much like MM is? So it&#39;s not really about<br/>
&gt;xp, it&#39;s about loot.<br/>

&gt;&gt; On the area of zones. Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill. Mistmoore is<br/>
&gt;&gt; too deadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too<br/>
&gt;&gt; frequently to make the entry area safe. Unrest is packed, last three<br/>
 </span></blockquote>times I was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; there there were 50+ people in them. Sol A and Sol B are obviously beyond<br/>
&gt;&gt; my groups ability at 21-24. Haven&#39;t tried Paw since they lowered the<br/>
&gt;&gt; difficulty but there was no way before. Befallen is also fairly<br/>
&gt;&gt; crowded and most everything there is too low to give me much xp anyhow.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tried<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; hunting skeletons in rathe but there were too many groups there as well.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Went<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; to S Karana but there were 75+ people there mostly hunting aviaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Funny  I found the early 20s very frustrating with my ranger and now<br/>
&gt;with my bard as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;MM- you need a full group at the early 20s. Stay on the wall by the<br/>
&gt;lake.<br/>
&gt;Permafrost- get a group and work the entrance only.<br/>
&gt;Everfrost- You can try doing Icy Orcs but the site always camped and the<br/>
&gt;spawn rate is too slow to really make it worthwhile.<br/>
&gt;Upper Guk is nice for early 20s as long as you don&#39;t mind ruining your<br/>
&gt;Froglock faction.<br/>
&gt;Befallen- this dungeon will green out for your group in a couple of<br/>
&gt;levels but bottom floor is still good _if_ it&#39;s not camped all to hell<br/>
&gt;by farmers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These are places you can try. Forget Unrest and Aviaks as those spawns<br/>
&gt;are just too flipping full already<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The group my bard plays with though has so little downtime that<br/>
&gt;&gt; we waste a lot of time when we are fully capable of knocking<br/>
&gt;&gt; something off, only there isn&#39;t anything available. That<br/>
&gt;&gt; frustration has cost me more guildmates than I care to think about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And the failure of the high level characters to understand the plight of<br/>
&gt;the mid level characters has caused more guilds to explode then I care<br/>
&gt;to mention.  It can be heartbreaking to watch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Its really frustrating hearing about all the new quests on the plane<br/>
&gt;&gt; of sky when quests are my favorite part of the game.  Lame as many of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; are they are still more fun than camping.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The quests are my favorite parts of the game too.  If it were not for<br/>
&gt;them and a very small handful of wonderful people on my server, I&#39;d have<br/>
&gt;left the game long ago.<br/>
