<div id="ygrps-yiv-277670952">What&#39;s wrong with your top of the line Creeping Darkness line spell?  I<br/>
would think that combined with Bond of death would be fairly devastating.<br/>
Combined with the power of Necro pets its obscene.  Your two DoT&#39;s and pet<br/>

Heh actually giants are harder then sea furies. There is a little unknown<br/>
fact about them but sinced they nerfed the exp I guess I can let it out.<br/>
Sea furies are just cyclops with a new name. At first they dropped the same<br/>
words a normal cyclops did. Verant forgot to upgrade the ac and attack<br/>
rating heh.<br/>
<br/>
In other words I&#39;m not talking about resisted I&#39;m saying a necro without a<br/>
pet unless fighting undead is basically uselss. The dots take way to long at<br/>
high levels excluding planes to be of use. The only thing that it helps<br/>
mildly with is the ghoul lord which has about 10k hp but even then they only<br/>
do half to 3/4 damage. Besides the fact that the only real good dot besides<br/>
lifetap is heat based which means you can&#39;t use it in half of the high level<br/>
zones and as it is don&#39;t ask me why but high level mobs in general are more<br/>
resistable to heat spells then cold. Why do you think high level druids<br/>
complained that they couldn&#39;t use any dd spells because they were all fire<br/>
based and now have a cold based spell? Simple fact of the matter is that<br/>
without a pet I&#39;m useless in a group unless in the planes or fighting<br/>
undead. I can&#39;t nuke, I can&#39;t dot because they are extremly slow unlike the<br/>
shaman poison dots which work in 40 seconds. I can&#39;t heal very well. So what<br/>
can I do? Use a kick ass pet that takes a lot of work to use.<br/>

P.S. Why repond to this but skip over my test report post?<br/>

&gt;You prove my point.  You feel since your DoTs take over 2<br/>
&gt;minutes (and fights are usually much shorter), it&#39;s useless in<br/>
&gt;a group.  Melee attacks are basically DoTs.  Melee classes<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t have the pets or nukes which you feel are your primary<br/>
&gt;contribution to a group.  How do you think they feel?  Sure<br/>
&gt;they can tank, but you&#39;ve said you can take seafury cyclopses<br/>
&gt;solo (presumably with your pet tanking), so obviously your pet<br/>
&gt;can tank just as well as them if not better (green giants will<br/>
&gt;eat most melee classes solo, much less the seafuries).<br/>
