<b>Subject:</b> Sneak does work <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536523189">I wrote a couple weeks ago about my failed efforts to sell to Krak, the aviak vendor at KFC in SK. He normally cons dubious and won&#39;t sell to half-elves (I worship Bristlebane, if religion is relevant). Carillon won&#39;t change faction. I originally used sneak and got behind him and he conned indifferent, but he wouldn&#39;t sell to me. I think I figured out what I did wrong. I had used hide right before which, though it does bring your target to indifferent, will fail when you interact with an NPC, thus proving useless for selling. So I figure that I must have still been hiding when I started to sneak, and the indifferent con I had was from the hide, and my sneak had actually failed. <br/>

Last night I was able to sneak behind Krak and sell successfully. Nice to have an instrument seller that far from a bard guild. Couple rusty weapons from some unfortunate egrets and invisibility is back in action! My new strategy is to always move a little with sneak before conning. That way I know sneak is working and hide is stopped. <br/>

BTW, I use MMM (21st song) to get down from the penthouse. So far it has put me on the ground safely everytime (safe fall will not save you if you fall from the penthouse). A nice strategy when soloing Aviaks: Charm Harrier or Avocet at top of city, MMM to the ground, find some open fighting room, fire up chain/fear when charm wears off. No substitute for a productive group, xp-wise, but a nice option not available to all classes at this level. Useful when you&#39;re bored, waiting for your Paw group to form.<br/>
