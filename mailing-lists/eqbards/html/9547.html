<div id="ygrps-yiv-653515485"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The way I understood it, any nighttime undead that weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;killed hung around through daytime.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was one kind of &#39;dread wolf&#39; that wasn&#39;t despawning properly when<br/>
daylight came around.<br/>
<br/>
On my server they said the undead are gone, but &#39;they will be back with a<br/>
vengeance&#39; or something.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to bet they will just make some minor changes, like fixing the<br/>
dread wolves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kithicor and Rivervale<br/>
&gt;are the only places for rangers and druids to train if they<br/>
&gt;base out of Freeport.  So putting level 40+ mobs in Kithicor<br/>
&gt;really limits the playability and locale options for certain<br/>
&gt;classes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t a big deal in my opinion, honestly, because we just got this GM<br/>
like a few weeks ago. So to make him a little harder to get to isn&#39;t so much<br/>
of a big deal. Many of us have gone 35 levels without having a GM in<br/>
Kithicor - we had to run to Surefall or Kelethin every time we wanted to<br/>
train or buy spells - the new rangers should be so spoiled as to think<br/>
Verant OWES us one there. ;)<br/>
