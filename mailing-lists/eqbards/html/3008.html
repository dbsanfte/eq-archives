Funny thing about some ISP&#39;s... they just rent POP&#39;s from major backbone<br/>
operators.  E.g.:  I connect my ISDN thru GTE then they raise their rates so<br/>
I drop my account and go with MSN.  Hehe - access number to dial stays the<br/>
same and tracert shows my first hops are thru UUNET.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest going with and ISP that has international or at least national<br/>
coverage:<br/>
<br/>
MSN<br/>
GTE (analog only their ISDN deal stinks)<br/>
Concentric a.k.a. Cris<br/>
IBM&#39;s Global Networking<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise search like yahoo or alta vista and find who won the latest ISP<br/>
shoot-out.<br/>
<br/>
Or get a cable modem or xDSL if available in your area.<br/>

		You&#39;re kidding, that&#39;s the ping rate?  No wonder I am amazed<br/>
anyone can<br/>
		twist more than two songs.  Last nite it was actually green<br/>
all nite but was<br/>
		still in the 300&#39;s to 400&#39;s.  I knew AOL stunk, but not that<br/>
bad.  So if it<br/>
		really is time for a new ISP any suggestions out there?  Who<br/>
is good, since<br/>
		mine is obviously far worse than I thought.</div>
