<div id="ygrps-yiv-179018123">can 2 or more bards play the same song in a group?? I tried doing hymn of<br/>
Restoration one time while another bard in our group was,  and I kept<br/>
getting the (your song did not take hold) message, It may be just some songs<br/>
I suppose.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been coming to this list for a long time reading and enjoying the<br/>
&gt;comments, so I figured it was time to hop on aboard.  Hola everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m currently a drunken bard on Rodcet Nife and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;have obtained lvl 42.  Anxiously, awaiting lvl 43<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Take for example, the level 42 song: Berserk Cresendo.  Great song, 17 str<br/>
&gt;and a extra 5% attack speed from the Celerity song...  but it won&#39;t stack<br/>
&gt;with anything!  I went back to the celerity/anthem stack because three<br/>
stats<br/>
&gt;boosted (str/agi/dex) and still 20% increase in attack; it far outways the<br/>
&gt;Berserker song.  So yes, another high level song that is up to par with<br/>
&gt;another anti-disease song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
urk, not what i wanted hear. just got lvl 40, and i do the chant celerity<br/>
stack too ( i assume you mean chant of battle instead of anthem, cause<br/>
celerity and anthem dont stack for me). maybe throw in the damage shields<br/>
of the psalms, maybe the fyils or whatever&#39;s chant if we need a lower magic<br/>
resistance, maybe bellows depending on my mood.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, I was at a loss recently to find things to solo while my crew isn&#39;t<br/>
on.<br/>
&gt; Still not soloing much, but I did find a fun way for two bards (or a bard<br/>
&gt;and a &#39;snare&#39; casting profession) to beat the crap out of a single critter<br/>
&gt;they couldn&#39;t do head on.  The first bard plays a stack of chains/bellows.<br/>
&gt;Slows the creature down just as fine as snare spell.  The second bard<br/>
sneaks<br/>
&gt;up and turns on fear song.  The creature inches away trying to flee, while<br/>
&gt;you pummel it to death, all the time keeping it locked down with chains.<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve killed high level 30&#39;s without ever being hit once.  And it&#39;s not<br/>
that<br/>
&gt;boring kite stuff either, it&#39;s much more pleasant to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i just grouped with another bard on tunare (keyana) and we had a blast with<br/>
a cleric and paladin. the 4 of us where taking on 4 spectres at a time (pal<br/>
was 36, cleric was 43, bards where 39 and 40). we just went right up on top<br/>
of the isle of spectres in the lake in oasis and camped and killed as they<br/>
spawn. The fear/chain combo was what made this possible. that and the<br/>
cleric and paladin where estatic over the dual chorus of clarity :)<br/>
