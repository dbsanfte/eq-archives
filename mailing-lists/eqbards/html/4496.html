&gt; On that same note, does Hymn stack with a shaman&#39;s<br/>
&gt; regeneration/chloroplast line?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I played with a shaman in Guk a few nights ago. He had to get out of range<br/>
of hymn or have me turn off hymn before he could use regen, but so long as<br/>
regen was cast while he was not affected by my song, when he got into range<br/>
he got his regen bonus and my mymn bonus.<br/>
