<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987519977">I recommend getting a PGT = Polished Granite<br/>
Tomahawk as well, it procs at level 11 and<br/>
renders you invulnerable for a short amount of<br/>
time during a fight. Usually runs about 80pp on<br/>
my server, but you can probably find a kind soul<br/>
with a spare one in the bank, if you don&#39;t come<br/>
off as too much of a beggar!! =p<br/>
Also, my warrior used this weapon up to level 30<br/>
pre-Kunark, will take you at least to level 20<br/>
these days.<br/>
Also, the PGT drops in Highpass from the gnolls<br/>
and is lore meaning that you can only have 1 at a<br/>
time, so you might want to try hanging around up<br/>
there a bit and you may just get to loot one a<br/>
group doesn&#39;t have room to keep.<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
