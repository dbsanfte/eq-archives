<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945806448">Geez you guys...  Try and get into a cooperative, team-spirited guild.  I<br/>
logged on last night and had two different guildmates send me tells saying<br/>
they had some Singing Steel boots for me if I still needed them.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Last night a 51 Wizard from my guild mentioned that he had a friend<br/>
&gt; (non-Bard) selling singing armor.  I asked him what the guy wanted<br/>
&gt; per piece and he said 8K.  I think this is absolutetly outragoes.  I<br/>
&gt; mentioned to my wiz that I heard on this list some people mentioned<br/>
&gt; 5k-6k and others even 1.5-2.  He said he thought prices were higher<br/>
&gt; on Xegony than other servers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard outrageous demands (5 - 8k) for Singing Steel as well.  I<br/>
&gt; just wish them luck in selling it and try not to LMAO to them<br/>
&gt; directly. :)  I was lucky to receive boots from a guildmember as a<br/>
&gt; gift (I feel so twinked! :) but I would not pay 5k for either gaunts<br/>
&gt; or boots.  There aren&#39;t THAT many Bards out there to keep the price<br/>
&gt; that high, even if some are naive enough to pay it.  I&#39;d pay 1.5 -<br/>
&gt; 2k, maybe as high as 2.5k if I go long enough without (or I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; planning a trip to Kedge).  Otherwise, I&#39;ll wait until I can get them<br/>
&gt; myself, or am able to loot some Imbrued.  (I finally have a large<br/>
&gt; enough buffer in 47 to tempt me to Hate next trip I am invited on :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, I sold my Lambent Boots for 400 pp.  I would think 5 X that<br/>
&gt; price is reasonable for the Singing.<br/>
