&gt; I&#39;ve been having an argument with my cleric of late. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He claims that the mana song definately gives him mana with every pulse,<br/>
&gt; as opposed to being a song that last has a duration like most of our <br/>
&gt; other songs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At some point I had seen data from a timing test that someone had done<br/>
&gt; on this subject.  I remember it saying that it didn&#39;t matter whether the<br/>
&gt; mana song was sung repeatedly, or weaved with 2 others songs -- the mana<br/>
&gt; recover was the same.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone verify this?<br/>

&gt; Got a chance to run a couple tests with my level 31<br/>
&gt; enchanter friend (my bard&#39;s 35th)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Times are just for one bubble of mana....<br/>
&gt; Clarity Alone : 72 seconds<br/>
&gt; ManaSong Constant: 65 seconds<br/>
&gt; ManaSong Juggled: 65 seconds<br/>
&gt; Clarity+Song : 48 seconds<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Couldn&#39;t find another bard around to test if the song<br/>
&gt; stacks with itself, that&#39;s still left to be decided but at<br/>
&gt; least we&#39;re sure now that clarity & the song do stack.  <br/>
&gt; And the song is just like most other bard songs in that it<br/>
&gt; has a 3 round effect, and can be juggled with two other<br/>
&gt; songs w/ no drop in regen rate.<br/>
