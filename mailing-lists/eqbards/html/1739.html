<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583823061">Well, I am amazed at a couple of the commands I have dug up in the game. The<br/>
most recent being the /split command. Had no idea it was there. I was just<br/>
trying to turn on auto-split from my keyboard. Instead, that&#39;s a different<br/>
command. /split is kind of interesting though as it allows you to share<br/>
money with your party... In case you don&#39;t know the command, it&#39;s /split w x<br/>
y z    w x y z are all numerical values. w=platinum, x=gold, y=silver, and<br/>
z=copper. All four numbers need to be in there (even if they&#39;re just<br/>
zero...) Pretty interesting...<br/>
<br/>
On other game-things-people-don&#39;t-know items, why is it that a large number<br/>
of elves seem to carry around lanterns? I thought that was a human<br/>
affectation... Oh well...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Get some things (rings, etc.) to add dex so that you can dodge more<br/>
hits.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Try to get your party to attack fewer mobs at one time - I know<br/>
sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; they all get pulled in - but sometimes a cleric can lull a few while you<br/>
&gt; &gt; pull the other one or two away.  The party can gang the one or two then<br/>
&gt; &gt; come<br/>
&gt; &gt; back for the lulled ones.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought Agility is what affected your ability to Dodge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Are you guys all attacking the same mob and ganging the toughest one<br/>
&gt; &gt; first?<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s hard to get party members to follow even simple tactics but<br/>
learning<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; use the assist command will really help.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t agree with you more on using the /assist command.  However, I<br/>
&gt; have come to the conclusion that the majority of people playing this game<br/>
&gt; are not aware of the utility of the /assist command.  I always request<br/>
&gt; people in my group to use the /assist command before we start engaging<br/>
&gt; enemies.  Almost everytime I do that someone comes back and asks &quot;What is<br/>
&gt; the /assist command? It isn&#39;t on the Socials menu.&quot;   After I tell them<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; it does, generally their next response is &quot;Cool, I didn&#39;t know you could<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; that.&quot;<br/>
