<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987476399">If the person is being a jerk you can petition them. In the first month of<br/>
release there was this guy Soladdar(I think) that was constantly training<br/>
people, and he even threatened people with trains of orcs and griffs in<br/>
EC.  Now I died to one of his fun trains, and he even stole my loot to<br/>
boot.  Anyways, if he gloats as was mentioned the people in the zone can<br/>
petition him to be warned.  I was witness to that after a GM and two<br/>
guides formed a lynch mob to discipline him.<br/>
