&gt;&gt; Apparently the server let&#39;s you linger in the zone you are <br/>
&gt;&gt; zoning from.  I have died that way to a DVinn in my younger<br/>
&gt;&gt; days.  Zone with 2 bubbles and appear in my at my bind point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Want to hear something really bizarre? I was<br/>
&gt;going through the zone to enter the Keep in<br/>
&gt;Highpass and when I got through the zone, I<br/>
&gt;was at the zone border that goes from Kithicor<br/>
&gt;to Highpass instead of inside the Keep zone. Woops.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ya got hit with an undocumented feature (not a bug ;)<br/>
If you die while zoning, the servers get confused - because server A) says<br/>
&quot;He&#39;s dead Jim&quot;, while server B) says &quot;No he&#39;s not, I&#39;ve got him!&quot;<br/>
The master server then says &quot;Alright  - since you two can&#39;t agree, revert<br/>
him back to his last save point.&quot;<br/>
This was implemented because there *is* a couple of second overlap while<br/>
you are plucked from one server and plopped into the other.  During this<br/>
time, if you died, there&#39;d be a corpse in one zone, while your healthy body<br/>
was in the second zone.  You could then, theoretically skip back and loot<br/>
your corpse, duping items.  Thus we have the new system, which results in<br/>
some occasional peculiarities.<br/>
