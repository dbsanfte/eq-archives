 </span></blockquote>I think if you know what you&#39;re doing, it&#39;s possible.  I&#39;ve soloed my <br/>
modestly twinked warrior to a bubble under 16th in 3 days played time.  A <br/>
properly focused caster will level much faster than a melee character <br/>
(they can fight higher level stuff and it takes them less time to med <br/>
than it takes a warrior to heal).  And it will be even faster if he is <br/>
twinked and/or receives assistance from higher level friends.  For <br/>
casters, you basically need to know where there are a good number of <br/>
white/yellow spawns (for melee, you need high blues).  My warrior&#39;s <br/>
impending problem is that I don&#39;t know where to find a lot of level 14/15 <br/>
MOBs that don&#39;t come in packs (I don&#39;t know the bestiary well enough).<br/>
<br/>
Just to play with numbers a bit, if my warrior got to 16th in 3 days, the <br/>
Necro could certainly get to 18th (a rate of a little better than one <br/>
bubble per hour).  To get to 34 is another 17 levels (counting 30 as <br/>
two), or 85 bubbles in 7 days, which is very close to one bubble every <br/>
two hours.  This is certainly doable, depending on location and time of <br/>
day played.  In the proper spot, I can earn almost a bubble every two <br/>
hours still, at level 40.  (I mess around an awful lot, though).<br/>
