<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494909859"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Now - does anyone know for sure if that Jbootie gnome will cough<br/>
&gt; up booties<br/>
&gt; for plat or do you have to crawl around with 3250 gp?  Anyone feel that<br/>
&gt; lucky to find out?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s always bothered me that there are no weight reducing coin purses in<br/>
Norrath.  I can get an EE bag that will accomodate eight 2HS bastard swords<br/>
or eight friggin&#39; shields for cryin&#39; out loud, but I can&#39;t put 89pp 319gp<br/>
346sp in it?  Why not?  Since my character is not a twink, I basically lived<br/>
through &quot;The Depression&quot; of growing up dirt poor.  I still grimace at<br/>
destroying several hundred silver at a whack - that&#39;s a hell of a lot of Rat<br/>
Whiskers and Fire Beetle Eyes.<br/>
