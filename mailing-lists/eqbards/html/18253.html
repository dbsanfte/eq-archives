&gt; We took a party to City of Mist and fought a (or is it &quot;the&quot; ??) Black<br/>
&gt; Reaver. It was a TOUGH yellow-con (to a 51) golem-like thing, 100% magic<br/>
&gt; resistant, seemed to have well over 15K hits. We are all about to rejoice<br/>
&gt; over killing it after our cleric had gone OOM from a string of complete<br/>
&gt; heals on the main tank when *poof* a NEW Black Reaver spawned from the<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This zone is simply amazing!!  We have been going there off and on the last<br/>
few nights.  We took 34 people last night on an expedition to see how far we<br/>
could go.  The Black Reaver we pulled had four reincarnates before the Lord<br/>
spawned though. We got 3 Jade Reavers, a warrior only spear that just rocked<br/>
(sorry I suck at remembering stats) and a SK mace that is something like<br/>
19/25 +10 INT or something insane like that. From what I&#39;ve heard the Reaver<br/>
can reincarnate up to 13 times before the Lord spawns, I was hoping for it,<br/>
that is a fun fun fight!!<br/>
<br/>
After we spent some time clearing the yard trash, we moved up to the<br/>
building past the gazebos.  We had a single rogue with us which was a good<br/>
thing, we had to gate him to Rivervale to train lockpick up to 200 because<br/>
the door to that building requires a 200 skill in picklock.  Let me tell you<br/>
its scary as hell for 34 people to go into a room that only one person can<br/>
get us out of. We pulled into that room for a bit then moved forward. Our<br/>
puller found a transparent ramp so we all en masse went up there.  We got<br/>
high enough on that ramp that falling off = death by falling damage before<br/>
we got to a house.  Inside the house we got a 15 mob pull, we lost 2 people<br/>
but rezzed up and moved to the second house.  At that point about half the<br/>
party thought it was too late and wanted to leave so we levitated off the<br/>
bridge down to the courtyard (major train action there) and fought our way<br/>
out.  All in all that was probably the funnest thing I&#39;ve ever done in EQ,<br/>
we had a great time!<br/>

&gt; 9/19 +6 CHA +2 INT +5 Magic. From a Caller of Sathir in Karnor&#39;s. We also<br/>
&gt; got a gold shield with a dragon emblem (I forget the name of this<br/>
&gt; item) from<br/>
