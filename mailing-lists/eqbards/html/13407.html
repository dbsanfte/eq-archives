<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956331834">Vox and Nagafen have had pillage enchantment added as a component of their<br/>
breath weapon.<br/>
We took down Vox last night and noticed that a lot of buffs were being<br/>
dispelled.<br/>
On the plus side, I somehow managed to live in a group without a cleric and<br/>
no healer at all for that matter, the level 40ish druid dropped almost<br/>
immediately.  234 Cold Resist.  It *does* make a difference.<br/>

Some people had to go at this point and they gated or got gated while the<br/>
rest of us re-assembled and re-buffed.  By now we have heard rumors from the<br/>
other server that FoH fought Naggy and found that he will strip your buffs.<br/>
Never-the-less, we buff up and get ready.  <br/>
