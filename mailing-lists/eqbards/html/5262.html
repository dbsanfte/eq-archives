&gt; 	It is like that with some 2H Slash weapons as well.<br/>
&gt; 	When I had first started in release and all the big stuff started getting<br/>
&gt; found I sorta comlained a bit that there were no real bard specific weapons<br/>
&gt; or armor (cept now for the Fear Plane). Then one of my friends pointed<br/>
&gt; something out, something that I&#39;ve been noticing more and more. Even though<br/>
&gt; bards don&#39;t have specific things, I think they can use more stuff than<br/>
&gt; anyone. I think it&#39;s the staff of writhing or observer that is NEC WIZ MAG<br/>
&gt; ENC and BRD. BRD? WTF? Many more things are like that too. Why can a bard<br/>
&gt; use it? I think that&#39;s our benefit that goes right along with our JOAT<br/>
&gt; trait.<br/>
&gt; 	My thought anyway...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, while we can weild a couple of 2H weapons (glowing staff and<br/>
2H dwarven axe come to mind) our skill can never go past 1 in them. I<br/>
have heard 2 explanations for this, one that they were marked that way<br/>
so GM&#39;s could wield them for show, and the other that it was an accident<br/>
that they listed bard but as our skill couldn&#39;t raise no one could be<br/>
bothered fixing it.<br/>
<br/>
The benefit your friend pointed out can also be looked on as a curse. As<br/>
we are only one of several classes who can weild various weapons, and it<br/>
is well known that our combat skills are not up to other classes, it is<br/>
very unlikely we will get the first of anything found on an expedition,<br/>
so if you want a ykesha for instance, you will need a group of friends<br/>
who will help you who already have them if they can use one, or some<br/>
very fair minded people to adventure with. We were in better shape<br/>
before when we shared exclusive use of some rogue weapons like the bone<br/>
dirk, as our chances of getting one of those in a group were a lot<br/>
better than they are for a Ykesha where every warrior and ranger seems<br/>
to also want one.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if charisma is important to us, the staff of writhing becomes a<br/>
lot less useful weapon to us, as it gives a big charisma hit. Personally<br/>
I thought it was a terrible weapon for a bard image wise anyway so I<br/>
don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
I sure would have liked to see that new dragon&#39;s claw list BRD as one of<br/>
the classes instead of warrior and ranger but I guess there&#39;s no hope of<br/>
that. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one bard specific weapon in the game at this<br/>
point.<br/>
