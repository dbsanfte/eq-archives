<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121546855">After I wiped out my soon-to-be party in the lord room last<br/>
night (wow, most embarrassing moment in my personal EQ history), we lost the<br/>
room to a lone level 50 necro.  I personally didn&#39;t stay and watch to see<br/>
how long he held it but he was there, all alone and didn&#39;t appear to be<br/>
terrified. <br/>

				I hear this a lot.  &quot;Man, did you see that<br/>
49/50 Necro soloing the Lord<br/>
				room?&quot;  I&#39;ve never seen it done, and no one<br/>
that I know personally on Fennin<br/>
				Ro has seen it done.  I always hear words to<br/>
the effect of &quot;it just takes a<br/>
				bit of strategy&quot;, but no one has every had<br/>
any comment on what that strategy<br/>
				might be.  The Ghoul Lord room, if broken<br/>
and the three spawns staggered<br/>
				perfectly could not be held for any length<br/>
of time by only one or two<br/>
				individuals in my opinion.  The Boks and<br/>
Guks that spawn there probably have<br/>
				around 15,000 hit points and do serious<br/>
melee damage.  I&#39;ve been in high<br/>
				40s/50s groups that have spent three or four<br/>
minutes killing a single frog.<br/>
				If you get a Guk Wizard spawning as the Lord<br/>
placeholder you&#39;re in serious<br/>
				trouble with only two folks and a pet.  When<br/>
the Lord spawns he has even<br/>
				MORE hitpoints and he&#39;s gonna Harm Touch one<br/>
of ya (and hopefully) be<br/>
				procing Ykesha on you.  If you know how one<br/>
guy can stand up to that I sure<br/>
				would like to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
				Now granted, I have been in groups with a 50<br/>
necro where the pet solod Lava<br/>
				Duct Crawlers in Sol B and the pet had more<br/>
than half health at the end of<br/>
				the fight.  Not only that, the necro<br/>
(Cinder) said &quot;Sigh - you shoulda seen<br/>
				my pet *before* they nerfed Necros.&quot;  Well<br/>
damn.  A single LDC can make a<br/>
				full group in their lower 40s run for the<br/>
zone with a couple of deaths but<br/>
				one Necro pet (blue to me) can solo one?<br/>
And Necros complain?<br/>
