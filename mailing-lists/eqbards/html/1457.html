<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468435612">Well if Dud if fairly typical, I am really atypical!<br/>
<br/>
I use my CH Products ProThrottle (I am also a flight sim nut) which is a<br/>
programmable device for sending key strokes to programs.  See<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chproducts.com/pcgear/prothrot.html">http://www.chproducts.com/pcgear/prothrot.html</a><br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chproducts.com/pcgear/prothrot.html">http://www.chproducts.com/pcgear/prothrot.html</a>&gt;  for a picture and<br/>
description.  Basically, you have loads of buttons and can program a<br/>
keystroke or series of keystrokes to each button.  Some switches have 4 way<br/>
actions so one button will do 4 different things.  I put my movement keys on<br/>
one of these and stacked sense heading with each move command.  Other<br/>
buttons do the stuff I use most:<br/>
<br/>
select nearest npc & consider<br/>
auto attack<br/>
f10 change view screen mode<br/>
f9 change camera view<br/>
<br/>
/hail (I target things I see with my mouse and then consider them. If I<br/>
decide to attack or want to warn the party, I click the /hail and I<br/>
automatically &#39;say&#39; Hail a gryffin!  or Hail a lioness!  Handy way to alert<br/>
the group.)<br/>
<br/>
/assist<br/>
/loc<br/>
<br/>
kick bash & taunt stacked (for my warrior one button press does all three.<br/>
For my bard, I need to make some /say &quot;taunts&quot; like /say for an Orc you hit<br/>
like a girl!  or /say for a griz you really are a wimp! and /say for a girl<br/>
bandit you really are kinda fat!)<br/>
<br/>
I use the right click and hold on the mouse to steer - most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
About half the time, I use the mouse to work the songs but am thinking of<br/>
how I can make my buttons change the hot key pallete so I can toggle thru<br/>
those.<br/>
<br/>
I never learned to touch type and didn&#39;t play Quake or other games where it<br/>
was keyboard orientated so I stuck with my ProThrottle.<br/>
<br/>
I too would like to learn how to make instrument/wep changes with macros.<br/>
<br/>
So I thought I&#39;d tell ya all that since it&#39;s kinda different - also kinda<br/>
the same.<br/>

<br/>
p.s. does anyone use Roger Wilco or the other proggies to talk voice inside<br/>
EQ?  I have used it in other games but not tried it here.  I think it would<br/>
be good for people who already know each other but hard for strangers to<br/>
use.  Real voices might be pretty hard to role play with and yet there are<br/>
RP Cons all the time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>		I think I&#39;m fairly typical:<br/>
<br/>
		Autoattack is &#39;0&#39; on the numpad, /consider is &#39;.&#39; on the<br/>
numpad.<br/>
<br/>
		Bank 1:<br/>
		B1: Arms/Warsong<br/>
		B2: Bellow<br/>
		B3: Healing<br/>
		B4: Lullaby<br/>
		B5: Run (I think it&#39;s kinda thoughtless that we default to<br/>
walk upon <br/>
		disconning)<br/>
		B6: Sit/Stand<br/>
<br/>
		Bank 2:<br/>
		B1: Locate corpse/underwater breathing/Discord<br/>
		B2: Accelerando<br/>
		B3: Guardian Rhythms<br/>
		B4: Lament<br/>
		B5: Sense-Heading<br/>
		B6: Sit/Stand<br/>
<br/>
		Bank 3:<br/>
		Button 1: Sneak<br/>
		Button 2: Assist<br/>
		Button 3: Corpse<br/>
		Button 4: Forage<br/>
<br/>
		Still haven&#39;t worked out how to drop inv. slots into the<br/>
hot-keys and I <br/>
		can&#39;t be bothered doing the <br/>
		friends/invite/disband/smile/gurgle/fart/smooch/etc<br/>
miscellaneous crud. I <br/>
		should work on hot-keying more though. And to that fellow<br/>
who clicks his <br/>
		spells.... wow! My finger would be arthritic and<br/>
disgustingly muscular if I <br/>
		did that. Maybe you&#39;re a leftie... that&#39;d make sense.<br/>
<br/>
		Quick question: Someone mentioned the named fellow in<br/>
highpass spawns <br/>
		regularly... what times may this be, if you please? I really<br/>
want me one of <br/>
		those Tomahwaks but I&#39;ve spent so much time just sitting<br/>
around watching <br/>
		tons of very organized people take care of that chunk of the<br/>
zone that I <br/>
		feel I need to resort to more inquisitive methods. Nobody<br/>
there&#39;s willing <br/>
		to join me in conversation.<br/>
		As an aside: Don&#39;t you think it odd that so many gnolls<br/>
spawn right near <br/>
		where a captain hangs out and around the corner from a<br/>
bustling city? Sort <br/>
		of like coyotes in NYC.<br/>
