<b>Subject:</b> More advice. (go figure) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-486638943">Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all getting very tired of hearing my pleas for advice,<br/>
but you guys give such awesome advice that things go smoothly and I&#39;m forced<br/>
to move on.<br/>
<br/>
Last night our group went to cazic to get the RS BP for our rogue. We<br/>
arrived in cazic at the very over populated hour of 9:30 pm est, and<br/>
needless to say, EVERYTHING was camped. After getting in contact with the<br/>
AoF group, we put our selves on the list and ported over to MM to earn some<br/>
exp while waiting. 3 hours later, we get the tell saying they are leaving so<br/>
we port back and prepare ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
We were a little slow getting to the room since we had to rebind ourselves<br/>
in Ogguk and by the time we got there the room was fully spawned. But, using<br/>
the &quot;Ever So Handy&quot; directions(tm) from the list, we had no trouble breaking<br/>
and clearing the spawn.<br/>
<br/>
We pulled the sewer room first and learned that alligators have an endless<br/>
amount of HP. After that we pulled the avatar room trying very hard to kill<br/>
the avatar PH last. After a 10 minute wait, I went back in and pulled the<br/>
top room over the avatar globe. And then we set to pulling the sewers while<br/>
waiting.<br/>
<br/>
A few bad pulls led to evacs, as did some miscomunications, but when all the<br/>
dust settled the score was Us 2, avatar 0. We walked away with 1 set of<br/>
claws and the ravenscale BP we were after. ( if only it had been ruby = P  )<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect the camp to go that smoothly. Knowing the BP is the rare<br/>
drop, I expected to be there a few days at least before seeing the BP. We<br/>
got extremely lucky. We were hoping to get some boots off the cenobite also,<br/>
but he didn&#39;t make any appearances, so our rogue capitulated to buying them<br/>
rather than camp them.<br/>
<br/>
So, the point is now I need advice on our next camp spot. which is...<br/>
(drumroll)<br/>
<br/>
The Ghoul Executioner in lower guk.<br/>
<br/>
I know he&#39;s a level 37 ish warrior. But that&#39;s about it. Any info on the<br/>
other spawns in the room (how many) and his relative str when spawned with<br/>
the hood vs with the axe would be greatly appreciated. Also, I have yet to<br/>
find a stellar map of lower guk. (although I&#39;m working on one) I can get to<br/>
the store room easily and can navigate the live side, but the dead side is<br/>
still very much a mystery. Any directions on getting to the exe would be<br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>
