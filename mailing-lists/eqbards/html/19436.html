&gt;the level 50+ folks.  Kitasi and I were both agreeing that GM events should<br/>
&gt;be geared towards a specific level range.  For example, if there is a GM<br/>
&gt;event in GFay, which is a low level zone, then the only people eligible to<br/>
&gt;participate and receive any potential reward are those people in the level<br/>
&gt;range the zone was designed for.  But Verant doesn&#39;t do this.  If they hold<br/>
&gt;an event in GFay the entire zone will be full of level 50s trying to kill<br/>
&gt;the GM controlled mobs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>are you speaking of all gm driven events or just the test of events?<br/>
<br/>
the test of events seem geared towards higher level players, no doubt about<br/>
that.  is there anything inherently wrong with that?  not really.  i may like basketball,<br/>
but i don&#39;t expect to be able to play in the NBA.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In a perfect world GM events would be focused on roleplaying and not killing<br/>

&gt;(Chula the cleric got the Butcherblock Hammer (artifact) as a reward when<br/>
&gt;the GMs voted he roleplayed better than anyone else participating).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the ones i&#39;ve been a part of have been this way, as i posted in my other <br/>
response.<br/>
