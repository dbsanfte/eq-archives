<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437552165">Amen about the trade skills - it took UO over a year to get a clue, I<br/>
wonder if EQ will come around - the jury is still out.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;No, the level system is limited, but not crippling.  What&#39;s<br/>
&gt;crippling is Verant having nerfed anything resembling a trade<br/>
&gt;skill to the point where they&#39;re pointless, unprofitable, or<br/>
&gt;ineffective.  That means the *only* way to achieve anything in<br/>
&gt;this game is via leveling.  UO is way ahead of EQ on this<br/>
&gt;point (which in part is why UO has such different problems<br/>
&gt;than EQ, or EQ doesn&#39;t have some of the problems UO has if you<br/>
&gt;want to think of it that way).<br/>
