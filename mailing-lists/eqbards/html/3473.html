&gt;What I would like to see is an NPC that could bind for a fee, and limit<br/>
&gt;class based binding to one of a few classes. The advantage that the class/es<br/>
&gt;would have is the ability to bind themselves away from a city, which is a<br/>
&gt;nice limit for the NPC&#39;s. Make sense to me if you want to foster a sense of<br/>
&gt;being able to explore the world safely.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, that would make a heckuva lot of sense. J.M., mebbe you could<br/>
suggest this idea:<br/>
Inn-running NPC&#39;s could, when given the proper coin, cast a &quot;bind&quot; spell on<br/>
a player. To determine the cost, hail the Innkeeper, and ask the cost for a<br/>
night.  It would make sense, RP-wise, and if you made it cost, say 1 plat,<br/>
players could still undercut the merchants, but other players wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
SOL.  This would still encourage players to work together to get bound in<br/>
certain areas (not every zone has an Inn, most Inns are inconvenient at<br/>
best. Certain Inns have associated hazards...), but allow travelers to feel<br/>
safer traveling.<br/>
