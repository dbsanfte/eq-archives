right click effects. If someone is going to use the entry level area they<br/>
are really better off just making friends with a shaman, druid or ranger.<br/>
Rebreathers and waterstones are great as well. The problem with bringing a<br/>

a nice little AoE dispell and not all of us had Fishbone earrings, it gives<br/>
us a few more seconds to get a breath on the dispelled person.</div>
