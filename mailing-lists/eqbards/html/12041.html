<b>Subject:</b> Sol Ro Temple Bardic Weapon Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-704181854">I ran by the temple yesterday because I couldn&#39;t quite remember the details<br/>
of the special bardic weapon comment.  You see, I was fairly certain that<br/>
the quest giver used to say, Remember to ask me later about &quot;a special<br/>
bardic weapon.&quot;  However, now he says, Remember to ask me later about &quot;a<br/>
SPECIFIC bardic weapon.&quot;  I think the fact that he says specific is<br/>
certainly a strong indicator that this quest starts elsewhere in the world.<br/>
We&#39;re going to have to follow clues to get the name of this weapon, at which<br/>
point we ask him about it and he gives us the quest to get it.  Sounds great<br/>
to me!  Anyone up for a search?  Anyone think I&#39;m loony and the quest just<br/>
isn&#39;t in the game yet?<br/>
