<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091495126">Well, you would think that since they can flag when you are wanting <br/>
to destroy something and make it have a pop up window confirming it <br/>
or you can set it to a default of &quot;YES&quot; then why couldn&#39;t they set it <br/>
to a default of &quot;NO&quot;.  And similarly, why couldn&#39;t they set a flag <br/>
for when you want to drop something?  I think that it is totally <br/>
possible...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure how they could code that without tagging them as No <br/>
Drop.  I<br/>
&gt; think that&#39;s the whole reason they haven&#39;t done it, it would <br/>
require a lot<br/>

Drop in some<br/>
&gt; fashion.<br/>

&gt; I think what Rokenn means is that it wouldn&#39;t TAG your items as NO <br/>
&gt; DROP but that you just simply will not be able to drop them.  <br/>
Doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; that make sense?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Please use some common sense, this would have no effect on <br/>
looting.<br/>
