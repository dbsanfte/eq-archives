No archery skills for us bards - merely an abberation or typo (the<br/>
speculation is that number codes are used for class types and a typo, e.g.:<br/>
a &quot;5&quot; instead of  a &quot;4&quot; would mis-code an item or some such) when the<br/>
database was loaded.  Thus, we can equip the item and from the outside views<br/>
it looks like you are holding a bow.  Ammo is another story.  Somewhere<br/>
there is said to be &quot;all /all&quot; arrows.  Normal arrows are coded for only the<br/>
classes that normally have bows and bards cant load them into the ammo slot.<br/>
But on some uncommon or rare drops - people have mentioned &quot;all / all&quot;<br/>
arrows.  Again, probably some mistake or oversight in loading the database.<br/>
Anyhow, I am looking for them.  Without the skill, I wonder if we will even<br/>
be able to fire the weapon (I am thinking no but we shall see) let alone be<br/>
able to hit anything.  Worse than the level 1 caps in 2hb and 2hs.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;SYSTEM ANNOUNCEMENT: Sylly Songsynger you have been banned for one week for<br/>
exploiting and using a bow and arrow!  Take this time and think about what<br/>
you have done!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heh, gone for 3 months?  Well, Verant has stepped up the enforcement of the<br/>
&#39;rules&#39; (play nice, exploiting, and consent theft, etc.) And there have<br/>
been - server wide announcements in the prime time hours of player<br/>
banishment, etc.  Take a look around West Freeport, we might find some<br/>
stocks and pillaries next - heh.  It would be kinda funny if they summoned<br/>
you somewhere public and locked your &quot;toon&quot; (ok, avatar) into a stocks.<br/>
Forcing you to spend some amount of online time on public display for your<br/>
so-called crimes.<br/>

&gt; OK I&#39;m just got Kunark after taking a 3 month break from EQ.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; avoiding all the Kunark related posts so this one has me confused.  Do we<br/>
&gt; now get to train Bow skill?  If not, whats the purpose of this bow?  The<br/>
&gt; charisma and magic save is nice, but I think the runed bone fork is still<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
