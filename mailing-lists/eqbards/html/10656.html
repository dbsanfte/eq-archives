&gt;I was experimenting with the baking skill the other day..  I bought a spit<br/>
&gt;and noticed something!  This spit is very light, Less than a pound (i think<br/>
&gt;.2 weight?  I cant remember) And it has 6 spots for holding stuff..  Im<br/>
&gt;thinking about getting all spits for my inv spots cuz my backpacks are heavy<br/>
&gt;with my bronze = ^_^ =<br/>

items, and will even hold extra-large things (like Halberds)  Just be <br/>
careful to never ever hit the &quot;combine&quot; button....<br/>
