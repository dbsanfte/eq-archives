Hehe, my logic is not that complicated - hey I can barely play 2 songs at<br/>
the same time:<br/>
<br/>
you kill dragon = you spank dragon<br/>
<br/>
dragon kill you = you get spanked<br/>
<br/>
The rumor and hearsay I heard was Storm had agreed with LoD to yield the<br/>
camp at a certain prearranged time.  Maybe Mystic Legends knew this - maybe<br/>
not.  May be not even true. Who knows. <br/>

have no<br/>

I&#39;ll share<br/>
		  with you what happened Ms. Naive.<br/>
<br/>
		  LoD (ala FoH) does everything, they just dropped Nagafen,<br/>
and threatened<br/>
		  to come take Vox next.  The Vox teams rushed around trying<br/>
to do it all<br/>
		  before LoD showed up and the was the first major problem.<br/>
Then some<br/>
		  shaman pets got lose after pulling monk FD, and<br/>
inadvertantly pulled<br/>
		  Vox right into the King Room.  People paniced, and ran<br/>
around, and then<br/>
		  chaos ensued.  It really pisses me off that those mistakes<br/>
were made,<br/>
		  but it even pisses me off more that you think we got<br/>
spanked.  We didn&#39;t<br/>
		  even fight Vox.<br/>
