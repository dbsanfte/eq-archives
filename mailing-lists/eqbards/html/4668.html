<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010516227">This list needs a FAQ for the newcomers...<br/>
<br/>
The main trick for doing this is to setup a bank of quick-keys (click and<br/>
hold the mouse button and drag it to a quick key slot) and use the 1-6 keys<br/>
not mouse clicks to switch between the songs.  There seems to be some delay<br/>
involved with the mouse click - so you can&#39;t &quot;Riff&quot; (my preferred term) as<br/>
well no matter how quick you are at clicking that mice.<br/>
<br/>
Also - it seems some people get better results - I&#39;ve NEVER been able to<br/>
Riff four songs like some have - so ping/pl time may be a factor - as well<br/>
perhaps how fast your machine is..  I definitely saw an improvement when I<br/>
went to the quick-key method..<br/>
