<div id="ygrps-yiv-622775718">Normally when I go from Coast to Coast I travel<br/>
through Highpass. I&#39;m fairly comfortable with<br/>
this now since I can just zoom through without<br/>
worry of being dead by the time I hit the other<br/>
side.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ve got an evil race friend that wants<br/>
to make the trip from the Freeport area to the<br/>
Karana&#39;s area. He&#39;s level 11 and is unable to go<br/>
through Highpass since the guards there (and<br/>
probably citizens too) are KOS for him. The only<br/>
two other ways I know about are through Lake<br/>
Rathetear or Runnyeye.<br/>
<br/>
Rathetear - Gypsies are KOS to all evil races.<br/>
Highpass - Guards/citizens are KOS to evil races.<br/>
Runnyeye - Gotta go through Rivervale. KOS to evil.<br/>
<br/>
How does an evil race player make this journey?<br/>
It seems impossible to me. I&#39;ve never been through<br/>
the Rathetear areas as of yet, so I don&#39;t know if<br/>
there&#39;s room to run around the Gypsies or not..<br/>
But from the map I&#39;ve seen, it doesn&#39;t look like<br/>
there is.<br/>
<br/>
Any tips for an escort service Bard would be<br/>
much appreciated.  :)</div>
