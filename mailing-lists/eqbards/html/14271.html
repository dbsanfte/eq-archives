<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054540711">I tend to be an &quot;early adopters&quot; with Drivers (as long as the word &quot;Beta&quot;<br/>
doesn&#39;t appear in the version number) and put the latest drivers shortly<br/>
after they were released by Creative.  I&#39;ve never have seen an SB-Live<br/>
related crash.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;realism&quot; of the sound - I have to mention - when I first<br/>
started - my cats would completely freak out from the Spider clacking<br/>
sound..  It took them a while to get used to it...<br/>

&gt; Hehehe, well - don&#39;t know bout that Mushroom men sound an aweful lot like<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; poggostick to me - for anyone out there that might actually remember what<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; poggostick was. Or a date stamper - course - what&#39;s a Mushroom man<br/>
SUPPOSED<br/>
&gt; to sound like - guess poggostick is fine.<br/>
