<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599266512">I dont know about anyone else... but... I used to<br/>
subcsribe to  the  digest, and boy do those   get<br/>
long.  It was not uncommon for  it to be 40  or 50<br/>
pages and there  are  four or five a day.  Well over <br/>
half  of that content is duplicates or the advertising<br/>
at the bottom or each  post.  This gets really old<br/>
reading fast.  Either I would print them out so I<br/>
could easily see where the true content was easily, or<br/>
I would just endlessly hit page down and miss a post <br/>
every now and then.  It is simple courtesy to clip the<br/>
extra off.  I for one wish everyone  would take the<br/>
time to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Also on the &quot;high level song by Brussco&quot;  I thought<br/>
they were just being cute... <br/>
