<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089749535"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I auctioned for the trollhide belt for months and months on <br/>
&gt;E&#39;ci and finally got one at the bazaar 2 weeks ago for 120pp, <br/>
&gt;they are dropped by the froglock warden in upper guk as the <br/>
&gt;rare drop, the gloves being the common.  I think I actually <br/>
&gt;got really lucky to get the belt for 120 considering how rare <br/>
&gt;it seems to be.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once again another example of what happens when a BRD/ROG item<br/>
is in the game.  There&#39;s just not that many people who want one<br/>
and thus the price is never driven up any higher.  It is a worst<br/>
case 10% uncommon drop from a mid-20s? froggie in upper guk.<br/>
<br/>
Elf-hide gloves:  50pp - 75pp<br/>
Troll-hide belt:  100pp - 150pp  <br/>
<br/>
(if you pay more then you must be desperate or auctioning against<br/>
 someone, because it isn&#39;t worth more than 150pp to most people)<br/>
<br/>
Usually Trolls have these items, and 150pp is a lot to a mid<br/>
twenties troll who just beat up a froggie in guk for something<br/>
he cannot use.<br/>
<br/>
120pp isn&#39;t a bad deal at all, good job.<br/>
