<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751166464">I have played several characters till early teens, I must say my new bard (10th) is the best of the lot. I trully enjoy the reward every level, I also like the fact not all songs are avail at every Bard Hall. I have opinions on Twinking but they are simply my opinion and even though I feel justified in my beliefs I understand other people also have their own beliefs. I can easily see how wars based on relegion happen, but as long as we all respect everyones right to an opinion then things will be fine.<br/>
I was given 20Plat as a new player by a person simply walking by, I had never met him before and was reciently given a Thulian Claw by an old friend (Yes this is twinking) but I do not feel like I have cheated in any way, I did not ask for the claw and I have copped plenty for using it. Usually like I am 16th level and you con green to me yet you have a high level weapon you cheating twink, I feel this not fair as all I have is this claw and a set of PW armour and a drum.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway my 2c on twinking.<br/>
