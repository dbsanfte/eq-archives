<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018800661">Heh heh yeah, my druid went from 15 to 16 in one night too.  Too bad bards<br/>
can&#39;t snare at that level, much less fight yellows solo.  I made 16 an<br/>
amazing 9 times.  Brrrr, 15th.  Yech.  Haven&#39;t died 9 times total since and<br/>
0 times at 20th.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The incident happened way back in June.  Yes I was 15th level for 2.5<br/>
&gt; months.  I cannot think of any level I have hated more so far.  The last 2<br/>
&gt; levels have breezed by with no more playing time than usual.<br/>
