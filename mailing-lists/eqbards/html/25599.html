<b>Subject:</b> I have a question about Lambent <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776165809">For the Lambent BP quest... has anyone done it within the last month or two?<br/>
<br/>
Because to do it you need a carapace from Lower Guk,,, and on some websites<br/>
it says its no drop and the like below the details where players post a few<br/>
of them say that it is not no drop anymore and u can get it with any<br/>
character<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering about this because i already have the gypsy lute and i wanna<br/>
know if i have to get carapace with the same guy or someone different?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone know i could use the info... thanks bye<br/>
<br/>
