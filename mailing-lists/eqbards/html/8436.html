I dunno about that, seems unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
I had a rather heated debate online over the weekend with some arrogant<br/>
player on E&#39;ci (forget the name because I was too flamed) who started the<br/>
&quot;debate&quot; by sending me a private tell that I was the worst bard to ever play<br/>
the game because I was not singing Jaxon&#39;s Jig between fights to increase<br/>
manna regen.  He then got my group started in on it (I was the group leader)<br/>
and everyone was against me claiming I should sing the song and that it<br/>
works especially well for manna regen when using the Mistmoore drum (which I<br/>
do not have by the way).  <br/>
<br/>
I tried to explain the myth to them but no one wanted to hear about it and<br/>
this guy just kept saying he &quot;hates to see someone play the character class<br/>
so poorly&quot;.  Well I got totally ticked off and lost my temper and started<br/>
cussing like crazy at him (in private tell) to which he responded he would<br/>
get his bard character and meet me and kick my A** all over highkeep, to<br/>
which I brilliantly responded &quot;kiss my a** you stupid fu**er&quot; (I know, real<br/>
intelligent).  He said he was going to tell two of my party members (friends<br/>
of his) to leave my group so I decided forget this (was now shaking in rage<br/>
and very insulted by this guy) so I disbanded my group, apologized to the<br/>
nice people in it, and logged out.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could remember this guy&#39;s name so I could post it here but as I<br/>
said I was seeing red at the time.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that there are tons of lies and falsehoods about our abilities<br/>
that trolls and generally uninformed people love to spread for some reason<br/>
or another.<br/>
