<div id="ygrps-yiv-192229622">Made my mile long treck through the ice and snow last night.  And that was <br/>
even BEFORE I bought Velious... hehe  Managed to snag a copy at Best Buy.  <br/>
They had tons of copies, whereas CompUSA was out and wasn&#39;t expecting any <br/>
until Monday.<br/>
<br/>
The boat ride is a long one, but make sure you get off at the one and only <br/>
stop it makes (ok, I didn&#39;t take the return trip yet, so I&#39;m assuming <br/>
there&#39;s only one stop).<br/>
<br/>
Levitation definitely helps.  The Great Divide has a lot of very abrupt <br/>
hills and valleys (actually almost more like cliffs), plus the island <br/>
hopping you have to do to actually get to the bridge from the boat can be <br/>
quite painful, especially if it&#39;s snowing and you don&#39;t see the cliff, but <br/>
you can hear the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the wandering mobs were aggressive, and seem to hit very hard for <br/>
green conning mobs at 49, much like Kunark I guess.  As mentioned earlier, <br/>
invis seems to work extremely well for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Surprise, surprise, most of the mobs are extremely cold resistant...  I&#39;m <br/>
sure you all saw that coming.<br/>
<br/>
So far exp looks very good.  A level 45 druid friend and I kited around a <br/>
few giants and got quite a bit of exp from them.  We killed maybe 6 giants <br/>
before we had to log, and gained 3/4 a bub of exp at 49.  The frost giant <br/>
berzerkers, some scouts, and the elites were blue to me and ranged from blue <br/>
to red to the druid.  The giants make a goofy &quot;Doh!&quot; sound whenever they are <br/>
hit.  The higher level ones seemed to be hitting for around 130.<br/>
<br/>
The dorf city was neat looking, but the vendors made me feel like Joe <br/>
Tourist in Disneyland.  I mean one was actually selling SOUVENEIRS!<br/>
<br/>
Be very careful on the crystal clear ice spots in the dorf city.  It&#39;s <br/>
entirely possible to slide off to the side (if you&#39;re aiming that way) and <br/>
drop into the pit which you&#39;ll have to get someone to port you out of unless <br/>
you can gate.  It&#39;s also difficult to change direction once you get on the <br/>
ice.  Actually it&#39;d be fun if it wasn&#39;t dangerous.  I always thought the ice <br/>
in Everfrost should be like that so you could iceskate on it... hehe<br/>
<br/>
The new inventory screen is interesting, but will take some getting used to. <br/>
  I like the new &quot;auto-equip&quot; box that you can drop an item on it and it <br/>
will be equipped in the appropriate slot on your body.  Should be great for <br/>
quick corpse looting.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s also more difficult to manually <br/>
place items in the appropriate body slot since they are no longer labelled <br/>
(ie. shoulder, legs, feet, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, transparent polygons don&#39;t seem to work.  This is the <br/>
grey-ish tinted background to see-through windows (ie. like the chat area).  <br/>
Now, whether you have transparent polygons on or not, it&#39;s completely clear, <br/>
making reading text difficult over the bright snow background, regardless of <br/>
the text color.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I hope they fix is the loot-inspection pop-up.  When you right <br/>
click an item you are looting, the info text pops up in the upper left <br/>
corner of the screen, making it almost impossible to read the stats.  There <br/>
is no window, just the text drawn on top of the lag meter, the name of the <br/>
corpse you are looting, and the loot box.  They need to fix that soon.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was an interesting voyage.  See you all in Velious!<br/>
