<div id="ygrps-yiv-951745651">What level are Cobalt Drakes?  I&#39;ve never seen one but would assume they are<br/>
found in Cobalt Scar, which is a 50+ zone.  This is a prime example of how<br/>
screwed up tradeskills are in EQ.  In order to tailor this item, you have to<br/>
be in a 50+ group to kill the mob that drops the components.  The item that<br/>
you can craft from the components is nice but not good enough to replace the<br/>
items a 50+ character most likely already has.  So basically the only people<br/>
who could use them are twinks or true newbies.  Would be nice if 50+ mobs<br/>
dropped items which could be used by blacksmiths/tailors to craft items<br/>
appropriate for 50+ characters.  Thats how tradeskills in UO work and how<br/>
they are supposed to work in UO2 and DAoC.<br/>

There is one new type of tailored armor that bards can wear,(Reinforced<br/>
Cobalt Drake) but the AC is so low I doubt we ever would except perhaps for<br/>
the Charisma plus arms.<br/>
