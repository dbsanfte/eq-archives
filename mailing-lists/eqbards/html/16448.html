<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665962129">I have to agree with Harmonic here.  I play a ranger as much as I play my<br/>
bard (both are level 35ish) (bard lost 35 in a fun lil naggy run) As a<br/>
groups snare person it&#39;s _critical_ that you keep npc&#39;s from running.  It&#39;s<br/>
not just an option.  It&#39;s mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in a group and I&#39;m not pulling my weight snaring then something is<br/>
seriously wrong.  If the person doing the snaring isn&#39;t pulling their weight<br/>
then they get disbanded.  I hold myself to this standard as well.  If one<br/>
runs because someone rooted/Ebonied/whatevered then it&#39;s not as much of a<br/>
&#39;blame&#39; but there&#39;s still some blame there.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I will tell a group &quot;it&#39;s not my fault if it runs&quot; is if there<br/>
is a magician with an earth pet.  as I said before 90% of the groups I&#39;m in<br/>
I won&#39;t allow the magician to use that pet.  They get _four_.  There&#39;s no<br/>
reason for them to use one that roots as it&#39;s power.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate.  Harmonic is correct.  If someone&#39;s job in the group is to keep<br/>
things snared then they darn well better do it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You would bet wrong. I&#39;ve had snares wear off on me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ll be blunt.  Snares duration is all or nothing.  Snare doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   wear off.  I see you fall into the lazy druid category now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Snare when the mob is at 1/3 of it&#39;s life, you&#39;ll have best results.<br/>
&gt;   If you are the primary healer, your snare job doesn&#39;t change.<br/>
&gt;   You heal, and then you snare.  There are places where snaring is<br/>
&gt;   critical, Permafrost and SolA come to mind.  If you got resisted<br/>
&gt;   on Snare, then chances are the monster will not be running from<br/>
&gt;   you as it&#39;s 6ish levels higher than you are.  Fight non-red mobs,<br/>
&gt;   or find a party who is closer to your level.  Snare works perfectly<br/>
&gt;   then.  I think it&#39;s not so much that the spell is busted, but rather<br/>
&gt;   the player.  Gotta hate user error.<br/>
