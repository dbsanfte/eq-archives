<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621765560">Hello every one. I&#39;m new to the group, don&#39;t know exactly if anyone <br/>
actually posts here anymore or whatnot, but I found this on a google <br/>
search. I&#39;m still looking for more things about EQ Bards, I noticed <br/>
there is very little interest about them other than what&#39;s on the <br/>
first page of the search window =D. I hope to find out more about the <br/>
Bard Class, and how to play it to it&#39;s full potential, maybe you can <br/>
help me with that. <br/>
<br/>
For now I&#39;ll start doing my school work. I&#39;m at school now...very <br/>
boring, seeing as how I&#39;d rather be playing EQ.</div>
