<div id="ygrps-yiv-224000252">I had a serious problem with this the other night in the Overthere zone.  It<br/>
was around midnight Hawaii time and my group (4 others) were fighting<br/>
sarnaks.  The puller announced Inc and headed back to the group with a<br/>
sarnak in tow.  Within seconds, all four of my group mates went LD.  The<br/>
sarnak started hitting on me.  I fired up selos and started to run.  Even<br/>
with a MM drum equipped, I couldn&#39;t outrun the sarnak.  Then I start going<br/>
LD as well and eventually got the Disconnected from server message.  I had<br/>
to do a hard reboot and when I logged back in I was in FV naked.  Lost a<br/>
entire bub of EXP due to lag.  To say the least I was quite pissed off.  <br/>
<br/>
At the time of the disconnect there were only around 10 people in the zone<br/>
and around 600 people on the server.  Thats not enough people to cause<br/>
normal lag so the only explanation I think is valid is there was either a<br/>
server problem or a router problem.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Patch effects (OT)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was the stated reason for the patch, but I found that either it had<br/>
quite the opposite effect, or by coincidence there were far more connection<br/>
problems last nite than I have ever seen in 14+ months of play.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
been disconnected more than once on any given night since I got my cable<br/>
modem 6 months or so ago.  Last night I was disconnected 12 times.  On about<br/>
half those occasions I was disconnected and left at the &quot;You have been<br/>
disconnected&quot; screen while EQ locked up the computer forcing a hard reboot.<br/>
<br/>
I was apparently not alone in my difficulties.  A /who in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
showed 60 characters present, but 23 of them were LinkDead.  I have never<br/>
seen so many LinkDead characters in one zone before.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone else have troubles?  Was there perhaps some other network issue<br/>
at work or was this caused by the patch?  If it wasn&#39;t caused by external<br/>
sources and isn&#39;t fixed I guess its back to Asheron&#39;s Call for me, as the<br/>
game was totally unplayable last night.<br/>

&gt;Coincidence? Someone want to see if this still works?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The servers went down yesterday to fix problems with sound that were causing<br/>
people to crash and lock up randomly.  Last night was the first time in four<br/>
months that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>
before I had to reboot my computer.<br/>
