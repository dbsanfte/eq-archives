<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376369747"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; lot of time in EQ should move on? I know people that<br/>
&gt; only play one hour every other day and have a great<br/>
&gt; amount of fun.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Well if they&#39;re having a lot of fun, they must not be the people<br/>
&gt;complaining about the binding issue then.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I have great fun and I am one of the people discussing binding.<br/>
Why is it always &quot;complaining&quot; when someone raises an issue for discussion?<br/>
I curse Verant for making a game that I think about during the day, hell<br/>
this game is quickly becoming my second most thought about subject during<br/>
the day.  I dig the bard, so I like to thinkin about improvements.<br/>
<br/>
What really pisses me off is Selo not working indoors.  Why a druid/shaman<br/>
can zone out/SOW and pop in and enjoy the effects and we cant sing inside is<br/>
beyond me.  They should make SOW de-duff when you zone to an indoor zone<br/>
under that guilse that you are no longer under than god&#39;s influence similar<br/>
to the minor illusion spell wearing off on zone.</div>
