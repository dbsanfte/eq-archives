<div id="ygrps-yiv-332013246">Whats a conservative estimate on how long it takes to get from 50 to 53<br/>
(three full levels)?  I play on average around 10-15 hours a week.  As a<br/>
casual gamer, I don&#39;t really worry much about levelling.  But getting to 53<br/>
so I can use Song of Twilight is something I would really like to do before<br/>
before Neverwinter Nights is released.  <br/>

well don&#39;t forget i was level 50 forever before kunark came out, that&#39;s a<br/>
lot of days there.  and being in a guild that does mostly raids is lots of<br/>
time and a big hurt on the exp bar.  50 is as easy as any other level, but<br/>
51 and 52 are no picnic when you first experience them.<br/>

&gt; with a little over<br/>
&gt; 52 days played.  For some reason I don&#39;t see myself getting <br/>
&gt; to mess around<br/>
&gt; with Song of Twilight anytime soon:-)<br/>
