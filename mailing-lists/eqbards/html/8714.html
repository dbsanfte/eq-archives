<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062041434">I agree with you that it would be more fulfilling to get the quest<br/>
components for yourself versus buying it.  I guess I will just have to<br/>
balance being patient and getting the items for myself versus the<br/>
practicality of purchasing them.  If I decide to get the items for myself, I<br/>
think my best option may be to get to 32d level and start grouping with high<br/>
level groups.  I&#39;ll be their mana bard in exchange for letting me loot the<br/>
quest components.<br/>

&gt; Personally though I do not plan on buying any of the components (except<br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; the gems of course), why?  Well nearly all the equipment I have, I have <br/>
&gt; acquired by trading, purchasing, or as gifts from friends.  For Lambent I <br/>
&gt; want the satisfaction of killing and looting these items myself.  If it <br/>
&gt; takes me long longer then other folks so be it, but it&#39;s just what I feel<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; the right way to go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for prices on some of the items, I would guess for the first few weeks <br/>
&gt; the looting rights may be expensive.  Also some of the items are not bad<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; there own right (most seem to be at least plate AC and some have small <br/>
&gt; bonus).  If you want to buy you way want to wait a week or two for the <br/>
&gt; market to saturate. My guess may be in the 50 to 200 plat range depending<br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; the item.  Also remember that after 35th lvl or so most players stop<br/>
&gt; caring <br/>
&gt; about how much plat they have unless they are heavy into trade skills.<br/>
