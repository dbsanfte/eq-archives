&gt; Yup.  IIRC, you lose 1/6th of your hp for every tick you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; drowning.  It&#39;s independent of how many hp you have.<br/>

&gt; Wait&#39;ll you fall into lava.  :-)<br/>

bored friends and I took some time off killing kobolds in Sol B to hold<br/>
a high diving contest off the ledge opposite the Sol B entrance ( I<br/>
think it&#39;s the entrance to the new quest zone they are putting in)<br/>
<br/>
With a running leap out of there you can get a great jump into the lava<br/>
pool. We got some great screenshots. The dwarf is especially funny<br/>
because when they do a running jump their animation makes them do a<br/>
summersault. With my slightly pumped up fire resist (BI Crown, Fork)<br/>
I was taking maybe 22 hp damage and if I sang chant of cooling I took<br/>
about 16.<br/>
