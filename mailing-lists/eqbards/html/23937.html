<div id="ygrps-yiv-732062815">I&#39;m actually wondering this myself... if i can just kite off his little gang<br/>
then hand him the note and maybe kite off the dopple (or does he summon?)  I<br/>
heard turning into a DE makes the quest npc non aggro<br/>
<br/>
I wanna do this part of the quest soon too... and hoping to haul around the<br/>
least ammount of people possible as to not waste everyone&#39;s time<br/>

I am finsihing up the easy part of the Bard Epic, and ran into a problem.  I<br/>
went to find the guy in W Karana who turns into a Doppelganger (Miraz or<br/>
something).  I found his little band of merry men, and as I approached, they<br/>
agroed on me.  <br/>
<br/>
Do I have to charm him to give him the note?<br/>
<br/>
DO I have to kill off all his lackey&#39;s first?<br/>
<br/>
In any case, do oyu think a group (6) of 50-54 will have any problem taking<br/>
them out?<br/>
<br/>
Elfson Allegro 51(doh, raided again last night so still haven&#39;t pushed out<br/>
that last smidge to 52) Veeshan<br/>
<br/>
PS.  I don&#39;t know whY i am bothering to do this since I don&#39;t think I will<br/>
ever be able to finish the quest since I depend on other guilds to take me<br/>
on dragon raids, thus I will never get the components...  Guess I can say I<br/>
am half done my Epic Quest :-)<br/>
