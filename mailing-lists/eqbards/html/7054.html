&gt; &gt; &gt; And Bards have much better battle skills than a cleric.  It isn&#39;t even<br/>

&gt; &gt; Clerics are almost our<br/>
&gt; &gt; defensive equivalent.  Their melee skill is weaker (4 pts/lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt; vs our 5 pts/lvl + dual wield), but their magical offensive<br/>
&gt; &gt; capabilities more than make up for it.<br/>

&gt; We were talking melee capabilities, not magical.  Otherwise you could argue<br/>
&gt; that a wizard was just as good in melee.<br/>

healing is better at combat than we are.  I suppose you could<br/>
argue that we&#39;re not supposed to be very good at combat<br/>
either, but still I&#39;d like to be better than the class whose<br/>
purpose is anti-killing.<br/>

&gt; Why not use charm?  Or why not kite it instead.  Root and shoot is just like<br/>
