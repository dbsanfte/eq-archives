<div id="ygrps-yiv-352737473">in upper guk, the squire if i  remember correctly. i camped that SOB so long<br/>
and hadnt gotten a stupid fork, that and the troll belt. And as soon as i<br/>
leave, my buddies are running to do a corpse retrieval to lower guk and got<br/>
both the fork and belt (warden)  for me. Talk about luck hehe.<br/>
<br/>
and the other night i was coming back from lower guk and killed the squire<br/>
and he had a fork on him, did a shout to the zone of a free fork, sadly it<br/>
rotted away since i allready had one<br/>
