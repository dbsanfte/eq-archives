Only thing I have to give is that fear and charm both work on non-PVP <br/>
servers.  But, you cannot charm a pet.  Can&#39;t even do that with NPC <br/>
pets unless the owner dies.  <br/>
<br/>
About interrupts, remember &quot;most&quot; spells have a refresh period, so <br/>
you just have to time casting just right.  In other words, even <br/>
though a 2.5 second cast time spell is a faster cast time then our <br/>
songs, there is still sometimes a refresh lag period that could quite <br/>
possibly equal or be longer than our 3 sec cast time.  (We have <br/>
almost no refresh on the songs.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope I made sense :P<br/>

&gt; I did have a few questions:<br/>
&gt; Did they nerf our ability to charm a player&#39;s pet?<br/>
&gt; Can you charm players in the arena?<br/>
&gt; Does our AOE fear work well?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do know that Bellows is excellent against casters, but don&#39;t <br/>
wizzies cast <br/>
&gt; faster than bellows? Also, don&#39;t enchanters mez cast faster than <br/>
bellows? <br/>
&gt; Right now, I mainly would be most concerned with opposing <br/>
enchanters and bards.<br/>
