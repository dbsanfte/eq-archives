<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742276464"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; FYI, I died a lot here at my current level 28 just trying to get to<br/>
&gt; places.<br/>
&gt; The shamans and wizards see invis and cast see invis on other mobs (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure<br/>
&gt; this has been mentioned before on this list, but it was a while back). I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; hoping at level 29 they won&#39;t aggro on me anymore, but not sure. I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t aggro on level 30&#39;s. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Solusek goblins, mages, champions,shaman, etc.. all can see invis<br/>
naturally.<br/>
<br/>
	Soluseks are still blue to me at 32, and they&#39;ll always aggro on me<br/>
if they see me.  At 32, I think young gobbies won&#39;t agro, but everything<br/>
else will, if they see you.</div>
