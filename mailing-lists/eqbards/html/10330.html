&gt;<br/>
&gt;    There is a well known fact to online games in relationship to<br/>
&gt;    player advancement.  I believe there is, in real life, a fundamental<br/>
&gt;    law that collectively describes this &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Players will take the path of least resistance (, to maximize<br/>
&gt;    the realized or potential gain - be it monetary or otherwise)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I coded on an LPmud for 2 years.  I wrote a lot of the object<br/>
&gt;    code and base structures, along with level design and balancing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Being invisible, I could watch players find sneaky ways around<br/>
&gt;    certain obstacles.  With 20 or 30 coders, and a mesh of so many<br/>
&gt;    styles and items... no one could realize the potential impact<br/>
&gt;    of adding X item to the game on areas where X item was not<br/>
&gt;    designed in mind for.  Earning an item that stuns a mob every<br/>
&gt;    5 rounds combined with some other item that also stunned a<br/>
&gt;    monster produced a unwanted effect in the game.  Players knew<br/>
&gt;    that if they had these two items they could essentially beat<br/>
&gt;    any monster without risk.  Neither wizard was to blame for<br/>
&gt;    the coding of these items, it was the unrealized combined<br/>
&gt;    effect in an area which the coding wizard had no idea this<br/>
&gt;    could or would happen.  Players will find a way... with<br/>
&gt;    hundreds of items doing a hundred different effects, you will<br/>
&gt;    never know the complete outcome when players begin to experiment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Is it being resourceful?  Is it taking advantage of the code?<br/>
&gt;    Does it really matter?  Once I learned of a player &#39;exploiting&#39;<br/>
&gt;    a method against a particular mob, I would alter the behavior<br/>
&gt;    of the monster under those effects to create a more challenging<br/>
&gt;    confrontation.  It wasn&#39;t to ruin the player&#39;s experience, it<br/>
&gt;    was to heighten it.  I am a player of accomplishment.  If I<br/>
&gt;    play a game that&#39;s too easy, I tend to get tired easily.  If I<br/>
&gt;    play a game that offers new challenges each time, I tend to get<br/>
&gt;    addicted, ie EQ.<br/>

This is exactly my point. This is what Verant SHOULD be doing. Increase the<br/>
monster difficulty, don&#39;t take away from the players. A player will work<br/>
damn hard to get the best items in the game, and the developers are<br/>
basically stealing all that time invested from the player when you<br/>
dractically nerf a hard fought for skill/spell/item.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that they make changes to long standing abilities of different<br/>
classes is incredibly poor judgement, and penailizes and alienates your<br/>
player base.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that they make class altering changes without informing players<br/>
ahead of time is just downright reprehensible.<br/>
