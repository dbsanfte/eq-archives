<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067475696">Don&#39;t use the levitation song within a dungeon.  There is a bug, or Verant <br/>
calls it FEATURE, that let MOBS hit you from anywhere while you are <br/>
levitating.  Actually for us is better since we can stop the song and land <br/>
anytime we want.  But for the other classes, they have to wait until the <br/>
spell wears out.  Druid friends also told me not to use it over water, since <br/>
shark can hit you from anywhere and there is no way to fight back when you <br/>
are above water.  I guess it is only for the spell not the song, we could <br/>
always drop down into water anytime we want.<br/>

&gt;Well, I finally got out of the first level of hell, and was able to try the<br/>
&gt;song I had prebought two weeks prior to hitting 31, Agilmente&#39;s Aria of<br/>
&gt;Eagles.  Boy was it nice.  Not only did it levitate me, but when it pulses<br/>
&gt;it actually raises you up a bit, so when it pulses during the highest point<br/>
&gt;of the wavey motion, it actually lifts you higher.  I took it through<br/>
&gt;Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, soaring past the aqua goblin camp, and paying no heed to<br/>
&gt;the steep cliffs.  I entered Unrest and floated around in the outside a <br/>
&gt;bit.<br/>
&gt;I perched atop the small island to the right next to the gazebo, and<br/>
&gt;attempted to fly over to the door&#39;s canopy.  I didn&#39;t quite make it, and no<br/>
&gt;sooner was I simultaneously attacked by a Greater Dark Bone, a Tentacle<br/>
&gt;Terror, and a Dark Terror from the depths of the basement.  These were no<br/>
&gt;where to be seen, but my text box was spammed with red.  My health quickly<br/>
&gt;dropped, and despite my efforts to flee, my pursuers were always right on <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;tail.  I eventually fell to their blows and received a birds eye view of my<br/>
&gt;corpse while I loaded to my home point.  Rather than being in the <br/>
&gt;courtyard,<br/>
&gt;as I was when I died, my corpse was in a cavernous very basement like area.<br/>
&gt;Seems as I was floating serenely around unrest I was really floating <br/>
&gt;noisily<br/>
&gt;down in the basement and disturbing the peace of some very nasty creatures<br/>
&gt;that dwell therein.  Three hours later, after delving fully invis into the<br/>
&gt;basement scouring it&#39;s entirety for my corpse, locating it through a wall,<br/>
&gt;and dealing with a very uncooperative guide (who said it was VERY<br/>
&gt;retreivable and levitation worked just fine) it was summoned to me, and I<br/>
&gt;went about my merry way.  The point of this story is to ask at any attempts<br/>
&gt;at an explanation as to why this happened, and how I can safely use<br/>
&gt;levitation.  It really is a blast as I thought it would be, but who knows<br/>
&gt;what mischeif and trouble I could get myself into in other multi level<br/>
&gt;dungeons.  So, sorry for rambling, but has anyone else experienced this, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;does anyone want to venture an explanation?<br/>
