&gt; &gt; Hey, Harmonic!  I hear you have some Lambent Bracers?  (I didn&#39;t say I<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t do it with my *primary* character, did I?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   How much you paying me for them?  ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What&#39;s silly is when players come up to me and ask me about my Imbrued<br/>
&gt;   and then start offering like 100pp or 200pp for a piece.  Or how much<br/>
&gt;   for the Six Note Blade?  The other thing that really floors me is those<br/>
&gt;   people who insist on me letting them hold something of mine to &#39;try it<br/>
&gt;   out&#39;.  One guy inspected me, and asked me how much for the Cloak of<br/>
&gt;   Shadows I was wearing... jeez, hello, *knock knock* I&#39;m freakin using<br/>
&gt;   it... hello, anybody home??  hehe.  ah well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, or the ones that walk up to you in South Karana and ask if you have any <br/>
extra weapons or armor for them.  Like I&#39;m carrying a backpack full of extra <br/>
stuff to hand out to newbies I don&#39;t know?  Or I&#39;m gonna ditch my current <br/>
plans and run all the way to the bank so I can give away stuff for free?<br/>
