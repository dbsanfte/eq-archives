<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143617978">not everything is under 37 in dreadlands so you&#39;ll eventually run out of<br/>
mana, hence the reason i left there to go to rathe mountains (and they hurt<br/>
less in rathe)<br/>

	I cant tell you how much of a relief it is to hear the exact<br/>
problems I have been having over in Kunark!  I now know that the assumptions<br/>
I was going on were for Antonica rather than Kunark.  Let me ask you this --<br/>
how hard is the Dreadlands charming game.  The dreadlands seems pretty<br/>
crowded with hostiles, which is both an advantage and disadvantage when<br/>
charming for obvious reasons.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; Also remember that while Hill Giants remember their last pet command<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will reattack automatically when recharmed, the Kunark giants will<br/>
&gt; not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; generally have to reorder them to attack every time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         THIS is the problem I have been having!!!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Anyone have a trick to this without getting the crap beat out of<br/>
&gt; &gt;you?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Lago Bardoon<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Depends on where you&#39;re hunting. The forest giants in the Frontier Mtns <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t remember their last command when you are having them fight each <br/>
&gt; other. However, they do remember if they are fighting other things. So it <br/>
&gt; may be good to have giant vs brute battles (kinda like watching one of <br/>
&gt; those Japanese monster movies)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the Dreadlands, I have had pretty decent luck getting the various <br/>
&gt; steeps, craigs, and braes to attack each other by always keeping just 1 <br/>
&gt; charmed and not switching targets. It seems like if I just charm 1 target <br/>
&gt; and then switch only if my target is about to die, I can keep them<br/>
&gt; targeted <br/>
&gt; on each other about 75% of the time (not really quantified, just an <br/>
&gt; approximate guess).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I run into problems when I charm the other one instead, as my previous pet<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; seems to remember how much he hates me and chases me all around the snowy <br/>
&gt; tundra despite having my new pet beat his head in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But just like in FM, I have no problems with my targets aggroing on each <br/>
&gt; other if they aren&#39;t both giants. Spiders vs yetis vs drolvargs vs giants,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; they all hate each other and forget about me as soon as charm kicks in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for what to do when both forget about each other and come after you<br/>
&gt; even <br/>
&gt; after you have charmed one, I have my &quot;target nearest npc&quot; key set at #1<br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; my number keypad. After I get a charm to stick, I immediately turn back on<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; selo&#39;s, target the other creature, and instead of running directly away <br/>
&gt; from them run at a path roughly perpendicular to their incoming path, then<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; mash the &quot;pet attack&quot; key.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Either my pet will get close enough to hear it and start attacking, or my <br/>
&gt; path is at a shallow enough path that the other giant is just barely able <br/>
&gt; to hit me before I get out of his range. That gets my pet on him one way<br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; the other.  I suppose if you are a master charmer, before you charm, get a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; consonant chain on your intended victim, switch targets and charm your now<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; faster pet, and give him his order without getting beaten on. I&#39;ve tried <br/>
&gt; this a little bit, but after twisting for a few hours just find this a bit<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; too tricky.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You still get beat up pretty good at times, and the 1 fatality I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; (in <br/>
&gt; a long time) was because I had 2 steeps and a brae on me and between their<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; stuns and interruptions of my songs, couldn&#39;t get away. Now I find when I <br/>
&gt; get in a tough spot like that, I just run out of their aggro and zone/camp<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and return.<br/>
