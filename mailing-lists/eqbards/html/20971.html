&gt;i used the eqcasters color wizard too, works really well.  the only changes<br/>
&gt;i made were to tone down the brightness of the guildchat green, slightly<br/>
&gt;darken the ooc and auction green to make it easier to read in full screen,<br/>
&gt;lighten up the tell and who colors for full screen as well, and make skill<br/>
&gt;increases bright yellow so i don&#39;t miss em anymore.  still need to find a<br/>
&gt;good color for spells.  i tried light blue, orange, i just can&#39;t find one i<br/>
&gt;like since it is spammed so much from everyone else&#39;s spells.  also hope<br/>
&gt;they tell us what all those other id&#39;s are in the ini since it goes up to 32<br/>
&gt;or so, or someone figures em out.  my group loot and blue con is super dark<br/>
&gt;blue and i can&#39;t read it at all.<br/>
