What I think he means is more of a static buff with a long duration after the<br/>
song is actually turned off, OR something that is created in a trade skill.   I<br/>
don&#39;t think that a bard was invisioned in either of these specific applications.<br/>
While I don&#39;t think that bards should have longer buffs where their songs are<br/>
turned off, I do think there are actually some pretty good ideas for the quests<br/>
or trade skills<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that an Incandecent Gloves (I use enchanter because they are so involved<br/>
with everyone elses quest items- and I play one ) needed to have a bard sing a<br/>
tune to change the Shadow Gloves to &quot;Resonant Gloves&quot;.  They shouldn&#39;t have just<br/>
had one class be involved in many of these quests.  In trade skills, image that<br/>
a bard was necessary to create even better armor/weapons- the bard can sing his<br/>
song to make sure that the metal used is &quot;pure&quot;, or that the seams are &quot;in<br/>
harmony&quot; (giving them additional strenght).<br/>
<br/>
Just random thoughts<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;First, it makes sense, we sing a little song, people pay to hear it.<br/>
&gt;This is a normal thing.  I find if odd that bards have no real ability<br/>
&gt;that PC&#39;s will pay for (like most casters do).<br/>

I&#39;ve been paid for offering to sing a soothing song to someone shouting<br/>
for a heal in Blackburrow.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often healed people using Heal Song, even. I am running by, see them<br/>
way low on health, and say &quot;Mind if I sing you a song&quot; If they say &quot;Sure,<br/>
go ahead&quot; I hit invite and equip my lute.<br/>
<br/>
It just takes imagination and roleplaying :)<br/>
