 </span></blockquote>Yup.  If any of you are in this industry or planning to join,<br/>
keep this in mind:  Whatever your concept for a multiplayer<br/>
game, the least common denominator will work harder than you<br/>
to make the game fit their concept, not yours.  Plan carefully<br/>
to thwart this.<br/>

KSing campers or their mules.  I only buy from people and<br/>
guilds I know don&#39;t stoop to KSing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One &quot;solution&quot; we stumbled upon was to not break up the<br/>
spawns.  Take them on all at once, with the item-dropping mob<br/>
in the middle or last (assuming you have the place to yourself<br/>
at the start).  Some friends and I were in the foreman room to<br/>
get a scimitar as a gift for a friend (L38 druid and still<br/>
using a combine scimitar, tsk tsk), when some druid way too<br/>
low level to hold the room alone came by invisible and sat.  <br/>
We explained what we were doing, and offered to tell her when<br/>
we finished.  She shrugged and brushed us off.  So I just made<br/>
my whole group invisible.  First goblin spawned, she attacked<br/>
it.  Second goblin spawned about 30 seconds later.  Then the<br/>
third goblin spawned 30 seconds after that.  When she dropped<br/>
below half health, I told her to yell if she needed help.<br/>
After a few more hits, she reluctantly asked for help, which<br/>
we did.  We&#39;d made our point - she couldn&#39;t hold/break the<br/>
room without us there.  So she left.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also have great armor is only marginally better that having &quot;average&quot;<br/>
&gt; armors.  It looks a whole lot better!  But the real &quot;twink&quot; for power is in<br/>
&gt; stat jewelry, stat items, and uber-weapons.  Those things will make a decent<br/>
&gt; difference in your performance.  Armor is just the most visible twink.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  A L40 druid friend was asking me questions because her<br/>
AC in leather was higher than a like-level dwarven warrior&#39;s<br/>
AC in plate and crafted.  I played around with my armor and<br/>
agility a bit, and figured out that her agility (126 or so)<br/>
was significantly multiplying the AC of all her armor pieces.  <br/>
The dwarf only had an agility of 80, so was receiving very<br/>
little AC bonus.<br/>
<br/>
I still need to test the &quot;armor absorption&quot; theory.  When I<br/>
tested it 10 levels ago, in full plate with an AC in the low<br/>
500s, wisps would usually hit me for 1-2 points with an<br/>
occasional 20s.  In full mesh with an AC around 460, they&#39;d<br/>
regularly hit me for 20s.  Now that my AC naked is in the<br/>
500s, I&#39;ll have to test it again while naked and see if I&#39;m<br/>
being hit for 1-2 or 20s.  Assuming of course that Verant<br/>
didn&#39;t tweak the game mechanics since then...<br/>
