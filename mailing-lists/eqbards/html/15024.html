<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005880264">Considering the interesting info John Kim was able to put together on<br/>
Lullaby not being affected by Cha, I thought you folks would like this<br/>
interesting tidbit of Agi info from two members of my guild.  I also figured<br/>
that since we get Dodge (even though it&#39;s capped ridiculously low), this<br/>
might prove of some interest to the bardic community.<br/>
<br/>
    It seems one guildbro of mine (lvl 35 ranger named Fandrall) decided to<br/>
test out the effectiveness of Agility vs. AC.  He and another guildbro (also<br/>
lvl 35 ranger named Mezzevil)  found a nice quiet spot and began the<br/>
testing.  Mezz (the test subject/sucker... heh!) wore his best AC outfit<br/>
with no Agi buff items (AC about 697 and Agi about 110), and let Fandrall<br/>
smack him around a good bit.  Next test, Mezz stripped down to his BVD&#39;s,<br/>
and again, Fandrall smacked him around (AC was 480, Agi 110).  The third<br/>
test had Mezz wear his best Agi buff items with as little AC impact as<br/>
possible (AC was 515, Agi 166... 56 point Agi increase).  Fourth test was to<br/>
keep all Agi items on, and put the rest of his AC items back on (AC 671, Agi<br/>
166).  A fifth test was done with same items as test #4, but attacker hit<br/>
from behind.<br/>
<br/>
The results?  A quote from Fandrall&#39;s post:<br/>
&quot;1) Armor class STRONGLY impacts how much damage is done on a given HIT, but<br/>
has nothing to do with whether a hit occurs or not. This is true with both<br/>
high or low agility (high and low being defined as 110 and 166 for this<br/>
test). Agil was held constant while AC was allowed to change dramatically,<br/>
if you compare values between tests 1-2 and 3-4.<br/>
<br/>
2) Agility did not significantly increase the percentage of times that dodge<br/>
or parry occurred. There was an increase, but it was within the limits of<br/>
what could have occurred based on randomness (limited sample). I could get a<br/>
definitive answer if I swung at him 50 thousand times, but I tested his<br/>
patience as it is ;p (btw I am also a level 35 ranger, but that is mere<br/>
coincidence.... I maintained constant stats for all trials so I could have<br/>
been any mob, but identical for all trials).<br/>
<br/>
3) Agility also did NOT significantly affect the number of times I missed<br/>
him. Again, there was a slight difference, but not statistically<br/>
significant. I was disappointed at this result..... seeing how much time and<br/>
money I&#39;d spent acquiring agility items that sacrificed some AC. It&#39;s<br/>
possible from others who have spoken that my agil difference in the test<br/>
wasn&#39;t large enough, or didn&#39;t cross enough &quot;boundaries&quot;, if such things<br/>
exist. (shrugs)<br/>
<br/>
4) Of the four trials, the lowest damage per SWING ratio was in trial #1,<br/>
max AC, low agil. Even case #4, with just SLIGHTLY less AC, and 56 more<br/>
agility, had higher ratio of damage per swing (5.3 to 5.0). This takes into<br/>
account misses, so it&#39;s the best measure of &quot;how much damage am I taking&quot;,<br/>
regardless of whether it&#39;s a few big ones or many smaller ones.<br/>
<br/>
5) The fifth trial showed that getting hit in the back isn&#39;t any more<br/>
damaging than getting hit in the front, from a damage-distribution sense.<br/>
HOWEVER, I found out that you cannot dodge or parry any blow that comes from<br/>
behind you. The miss rate was pretty consistent with trial 4. So you do get<br/>
hit with more damage when attacked from behind, but only because you can&#39;t<br/>
parry or dodge. (Since Riposte only happens at 35, it&#39;s a non factor in this<br/>
test.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could it be (as I pointed out in a bump to John&#39;s post on the EQ boards)<br/>
that some of the states are broken?  This would certainly explain why the<br/>
folks at Verant are extremely hesitant to talk about them.  (and don&#39;t start<br/>
talking that &quot;black helicopter&quot; crap either ya bunch of reprobates ;pppp ).<br/>
<br/>
Using his Short Sword of Morin (6/22) and Dragoon Dagger (6/23... in<br/>
off-hand) with Piercing skill at 176 and 1H Slash at 177, Fandrall&#39;s Dirk<br/>
hit for an average of 2 POINTS lower than the sword even though they have<br/>
the same damage rating.  Could it be that Piercing weapons do less damage<br/>
than Slashing ones?<br/>
<br/>
Interesting...<br/>
