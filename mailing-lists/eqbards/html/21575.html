&gt;         What you guys need are programmable keyboards&#92;keypads.  I have a<br/>
&gt;58-key programmable keypad I use to do all sorts of things -- its primary<br/>
&gt;use however is to give me direction keys on BOTH ends of the keyboard, as<br/>
&gt;well as a better layout for hotkeys, etc.  Not to mention I can switch<br/>
&gt;hot-key banks, and press a hot key button with a simple push of a key.<br/>
&gt;Since the implementation of all these keyboard commands, I can do damn near<br/>
&gt;any command or sequence of commands in EQ with my keypad at the push of a<br/>
&gt;single button.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         The price range of the programmable keypads on the internet is<br/>
&gt;anywhere from 24.95 (a cheap 20-key type) on up.  There are two available<br/>
&gt;from one particular company in 20 ($85) and 58 ($130) key models that allow<br/>
&gt;key labeling and everything .  If you guys are interested I can post some<br/>
&gt;links for your perusal.<br/>

I&#39;ve gotten her hooked lately). I can&#39;t imagine what she&#39;d think of me <br/>
working with a programmable keyboard. :-)<br/>
<br/>
However, this does sound pretty neat. I&#39;m sure it would be good for all <br/>
sorts of other games as well.<br/>
