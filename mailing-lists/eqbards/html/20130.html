&gt; Gauntlets drop at both the live side and dead side zone and are no drop<br/>

our cleric, he ran and didn&#39;t die while I was in the zone.<br/>

How about this in the leaching catagory. The mask of deception, my<br/>
understanding is that this rots a lot on most servers. I also see a lot of<br/>
lower level bards with one. When I have 19th level invis song is it possible<br/>
to get to the Assissin room (provided it&#39;s camped) and wait patiently and<br/>
politly for one to drop?</div>
