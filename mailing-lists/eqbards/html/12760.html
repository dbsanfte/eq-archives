Subject: Re: [eqbards] EQ Testing Procedure<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW about getting a character buffed to your present level on test? dont<br/>
&gt; &gt; hold your breath...they havent done anything like that since the<br/>
population<br/>
&gt; &gt; explosion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The test server is for testing, if they don&#39;t understand that -<br/>
&gt;   then I won&#39;t bother wasting my time.  It does seem that those<br/>
&gt;   few people who play on the test server and invested time into<br/>
&gt;   a character feel bad about importing a L50 character into it.<br/>
&gt;   I completely understand your position, but I&#39;ve earned all my<br/>
&gt;   levels already, there&#39;s no surprise or falsity in copying my<br/>
&gt;   bard to test.  You kind make it sound like you&#39;ve earned your<br/>
&gt;   levels on the test server, so everyone else would have to.  I<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t want to play there, I simply want to test there.<br/>
<br/>
I went to test way back when wanting to test too.. All testing (the real<br/>
stuff) is done by inhouse testers. And if I came across as what you said i<br/>
did not mean to. I have given up trying to become a part of whoever the test<br/>
population is....the only reason i put my time on the ts is to lend<br/>
credibility to what i said. I have been there ALONG time (in other words i<br/>
didn&#39;t just start a character there yesterday and only know the hearsay)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The truth is at L16 you cannot really test the majority of the<br/>
&gt;   changes that are going on as of late.  By promoting a character<br/>
&gt;   straight to L50, you cut the anticipation of getting new songs<br/>
&gt;   by just giving it all to them.  That is bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I dont want to be a buffie. I want to earn every level i make. Whether its<br/>
with my necro, my bard, my cleric, my shaman, my wizard, or my rogue...makes<br/>
no matter to me...theres bugs in things under 50 to. Id be more than willing<br/>
to test the things they want to add for us low characters *listens to the<br/>
crickets*<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve done it all, leveled frustratingly, and have all the song<br/>
&gt;   knowledge from experience.  You&#39;re right, it makes too much sense<br/>
&gt;   to do something practical like give an already L50 bard the<br/>
&gt;   privledge to test out his songs on a non-live server.<br/>
<br/>
Im just stating the way its been.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   And I had a level 10 monk on the test server... made level 10<br/>
&gt;   in about 10 mins via guide buffing.  So obviously, they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   mind upping levels.<br/>
<br/>
Well 10 levels is nothing. There are characters who started their lives as<br/>
30 40 or 50. Im not trying to get in an argument with you harmonic. Im just<br/>
letting you know what its really like on the test server from my eyes.<br/>
