<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520631708">Do these two songs check against the mob&#39;s fire/cold resist rates or the<br/>
mob&#39;s magic resist rate?  IIRC, someone posted a while back that every bard<br/>
song that affects a mob checks against the mob&#39;s magic resist rate.  But to<br/>
me it would seem to make more sense that these two songs are exceptions and<br/>
use the mob&#39;s fire/cold resist rate.  Can somebody confirm what the correct<br/>
answer is?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I recently made 38th so started using CoF for the first time.  What is<br/>
up with the text message you get when this song sticks?  It reads &quot;(mob)<br/>
begins to chant&quot;.  You would think it would say something like &quot;a mob is<br/>
covered with flickering flames&quot; or something to that effect.  I did a double<br/>
take when I saw that message for the first time.  During the fight, someone<br/>
in the group asked the question &quot;Anyone know why the mob started to chant, I<br/>
didn&#39;t think this mob could cast spells.&quot;  After the fight I told them it<br/>
was the text message indicating my CoF was working.  Like myself, no one in<br/>
the group had ever seen that particular text message before.  This<br/>
immediately sent up a red flag to me that this group (a pickup one) hadn&#39;t<br/>
grouped with many 38+ bards before so I then had to give then my standard<br/>
quickie lesson on how to group with a bard.  Hadn&#39;t had to do that in a long<br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
