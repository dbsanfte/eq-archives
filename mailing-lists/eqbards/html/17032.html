&gt;<br/>
&gt; Swift Like the Wind costs a LOT of mana, and doesn&#39;t last as long as<br/>
&gt; the lower level speed up buff. Add onto this that there is a speed<br/>
&gt; beyond which a weapon can&#39;t get any faster. And Swift Like the Wind,<br/>
&gt; in higher levels, isn&#39;t even used on people with haste sashes. Not<br/>
&gt; worth it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, our enchanters will swift our tanks and yes they all have haste<br/>
equipment of some sort (FBSS, Planes belts, etc.)  It&#39;s our SOP to SLTW on<br/>
tanks at the end of the buffing.  This is for Dragons and Gods.  Also for<br/>
general work in the planes our tanks beg for swift.  I am not sure abou the<br/>
cap on a weapon speed nor what it takes to reach the cap.  We buff SLTW<br/>
religiously.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So. Sometimes a minor speedup is good enough.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you have 6 level level 45-50&#39;s and you&#39;re farming Yk&#39;s and the spawn is<br/>
spread and they can manage to all stay awake, yes.<br/>
If you have 6 level 27-34&#39;s and you are camping the Raider room in HK and<br/>
are getting all spawns one right after the other, yes, prolly minor speed up<br/>
is ok.  If you are looking at the Nobel Dojorn or Innoruuk for the first<br/>
time face to face, do you really want a minor buff?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Quicken is very definitely a combat buff. And fairly high mana. Grouped,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d put it on my main tank and let a bard handle the speedup for the<br/>
&gt; rest, preferring to use mana for crowd control, or other circumstances<br/>
&gt; rather than keeping everyone Quickened.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, what are your &#39;normal&#39; circumstances?  There are circumstances where<br/>
the team has to fight mobs that are 100% resistant to magic.  In that case,<br/>
our enchanters go OOM buffing everyone before the fight and hope for the<br/>
best.  Different situations call for different tactics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just because it is better does not mean that it is always the best<br/>
&gt; use of the enchanter&#39;s mana. Bards ARE Still needed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bards *ARE* needed - I fully agree.  They make the mana that provides these<br/>
great buffs ;p  I guess you have to look at what is the highest and best use<br/>
of everyone&#39;s skills/talents/powers.  In the heavy duty situations, and the<br/>
Ghoul Lord with not quite high enough folks or for the first time,  even<br/>
breaking the Raider room early morn before all the rooms are camped can be<br/>
just as tough when you are at the level where the stuff is yellow and red to<br/>
you as the planar stuff that is yellow and red to higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
Much of EQ is the same over and over with the basic change being in Health<br/>
Point scale.  Ok, there are some increased spell effects too.  But generally<br/>
for boss mobs, you want to kill them as fast as possible.  SLTW does that<br/>
best.  Bards make mana for clerics and enchanters - they do that best.  And<br/>
there are probably more than one way to skin a scorned banshee.  I hear<br/>
tales of guilds that do planes and *dont* have monks to pull.  OMG!!! how do<br/>
they do it? Well, they manage somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Well, time to go home now and grind xp,<br/>
