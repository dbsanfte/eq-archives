<div id="ygrps-yiv-591999044">I like your thought process.  As for leveling the damage across multiple<br/>
tanks, I couldn&#39;t agree more.  But it is difficult in the heat of battle.<br/>

Interesting ideas, have to think more on it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
One issue.  <br/>
<br/>
If 1 30th level warrior can solo 1 30th level mob and then need to heal up 4<br/>
bubbles of health, how many level 30 mobs can 2 warriors grouped kill and<br/>
need to only regain 4 bubbles of health each thereafter?  The answer would<br/>
seem on the surface to be 2, but in fact assuming they were excellent<br/>
taunters with nearly equal damage output it would actually be 4.  Each mob<br/>
would die 2 times as fast and the 2 warriors have 2 times as many hp to work<br/>
with.  2*2=4.  Now while they cannot kill 4 mobs in the time it took for 1<br/>
warrior to kill 1 mob, once you factor in the downtime for healing (Which<br/>
effectively doubles in this case) they can kill 4 mobs for every 1 the solo<br/>
warrior can kill.<br/>
<br/>

PS	You don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve tried to convince my group to let<br/>
the damage they take even out amongst the tanks since that makes my healing<br/>
exponentially more effective.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So, how much do we need the group xp modifier to be raised to make it have<br/>
an impact?  Some friends at work today were speculating and I couldn&#39;t<br/>
follow their math so decided to do my own.  I know there are some pretty<br/>
good math liking folks on this list, so just please use my calculations(and<br/>
assumptions) as a starting point, not a knife point(hehe).  I have enjoyed<br/>
the binding and other posts today.  I hope this one has some good responses,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Here I go:<br/>
<br/>
Soloer gets 1 kill and gets 100% xp<br/>
<br/>
Assuming no xp bonus and no class xp differences to make the math easier - 6<br/>
person group gets 6 kills and each person gets same xp as soloer gets<br/>
killing one.   With an enchanter pulling, mezzing and setting up next mob,<br/>
you might keep up, but not the norm, but for this argument, assume it is<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Math:  6(100%)/6 = 100%<br/>
<br/>
Now with 2% xp bonus per person(more than one) per kill - 6 person group<br/>
gets x kills<br/>
<br/>
Math:  6(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 110% if 6 mobs killed<br/>
       5(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 91% if 5 mobs killed<br/>
       4(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 73% if 4 mobs killed<br/>
<br/>
No wonder those that can solo, do solo, to get levels.<br/>
<br/>
Now assume 10% xp bonus per person per kill - 6 person group gets 6 kills<br/>
<br/>
Math:  6(100+(5*10))/6 = 150% if 6 mobs killed<br/>
       5(100+(5*10))/6 = 125% if 5 mobs killed<br/>
       4 - 100% if 4 mobs killed<br/>
<br/>
So, if you do have that good group, you can get same xp(or more if really<br/>
good group) and have fun with friends, acquaintances or whoever socializing<br/>
at the same time.  And for those that have to group, it just makes it<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
We can only hope.<br/>
<br/>
Piemur<br/>
<br/>
PS - I can&#39;t help it - I am optimistic. But if they really want to reward<br/>
grouping and entice those that solo to group more often, then they need to<br/>
make it comparable to soloing.<br/>
