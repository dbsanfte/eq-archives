One of the things that Brad said to me at GenCon last summer was:<br/>
<br/>
(talking about building new things, crossing new frontiers...) &quot;and the<br/>
competition does not offer seminars in what they have learned....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe it&#39;s a matter of timing.  EQ was 3 years of development from start<br/>
to release. Maybe at the time Verant could have used it most - which<br/>
certainly would have been early on - UO/Origin was not<br/>
holding/giving/offering &quot;seminars.&quot;  And running one is a different subject<br/>
from designing/building, etc.<br/>

&gt; One of the comments Designer Dragon (Raph Koster, UO lead<br/>
&gt; designer) made to me was that Origin was offering seminars<br/>
&gt; sharing what they&#39;d learned about running a commercial MMORPG.<br/>
&gt; Verant was not one of the companies which signed up to attend. </span></blockquote></div>
