<div id="ygrps-yiv-545487288">We had an amusing incident last nite in Frontier Mountains.  We were fairly<br/>
beat up after fighting 3 giants in a row when we were suddenly faced with<br/>
another 2 at once.  The enchanter and I both got the same idea, and about 10<br/>
seconds later both got the message, &quot;that&#39;s not a legal target master&quot; as we<br/>
had our new pets try to attack one another.  The charms gave us a little<br/>
time to rest after which I let my giant go and we watched the two rumble.<br/>
Very amusing.<br/>

Interesting to read all the comments.  I have to admit to never seeing<br/>
this before, even when I used charm all night one time in Solusek.  I<br/>
just imagined it was another little unusual thing with Dreadlands/<br/>
Kunark, along with the random faction changes and the way mobs seem to<br/>
ignore the puller and everyone else and focus on one party member for<br/>
no obvious reason.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ll try out a number of commands and be more wary in future.<br/>
Even if we can just take 1 mob out of the fight it&#39;s a help, never<br/>
mind if it isn&#39;t attacking and killing the others alongside us! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again all!</div>
