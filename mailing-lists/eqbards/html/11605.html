<b>Subject:</b> Re: Warning on charming and shamen pets <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701505573">I&#39;ve seen this happen a couple times with my enchanter - and a charmed mob.<br/>
 Charm a mob that is attacking a player - and it doesn&#39;t break off unless<br/>
told. Hasn&#39;t happened often, but I have seen it happen.<br/>
<br/>
Never seen it with the animation tho - although I don&#39;t doubt something<br/>
might have cropped up it could have happened.<br/>
<br/>
With my enchanter (bard doesn&#39;t get charm for awhile) - if the monster is<br/>
engaged, I routinely hit /pet back off before telling it to attack a target<br/>
- that seems to work. <br/>
<br/>
Of course - my enchanter is #1 on the hit parade once it DOES wear off.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have had this happend to me twice this week now.  I charm something that <br/>
&gt;&gt; had been attacking a Shamen&#39;s pet (one was a party members pet, other a <br/>
&gt;&gt; non-party member). And both times the shamen pet decided I looked tasty<br/>

&gt;&gt; pets, unless you like being their chew toy.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me with a necro pet, and a<br/>
&gt;lizard an enchanter had charmed.  The enchanter wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;believe me when I kept saying &quot;Your pet is attacking me,<br/>
&gt;please tell it to back off&quot; throughout the fight (we were<br/>
&gt;fighting 4 lizards at once) until the pet broke the charm.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After the mauling I took in that episode with little sympathy<br/>
&gt;from the others, when it happened a couple weeks later with<br/>
&gt;the necro pet, I let it keep hitting me until the fight was<br/>
&gt;over.  Then after a sufficient pause to make sure everyone saw<br/>
&gt;it was attacking me, I asked &quot;Why is your pet attacking me?&quot;  <br/>
&gt;No denying that one.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think there is something funny going on with the hate list<br/>
&gt;targeting, and the inability to order a pet to attack a player<br/>
&gt;or its pet.<br/>
