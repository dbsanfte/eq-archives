<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016463160">Have you ever seen an NPC bard use songs? Didn&#39;t think so. I am personally <br/>
glad for this, regardless of my numerous LD deaths...considering some of the <br/>
bard-class NPC&#39;s in the game (Maestro anyone?).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now here is where the funny part starts.  The cleric had Complete Heal<br/>
&gt;loaded in the first spell gem.  Apparently when you go linkdead, the game<br/>
&gt;automatically switches you over to NPC AI.  If you can cast spells,<br/>
&gt;apparently the only one the AI will cast is whichever one is loaded in the<br/>
&gt;first spell gem.  So as everyone else watched the NPC beat on the cleric,<br/>
&gt;every once in a while (when he wasn&#39;t stunned) the cleric was able to get a<br/>
&gt;CH spell off.  He was able to cast CH enough that he didn&#39;t die before his<br/>
&gt;character disappeared from the server.  To say the least he was quite<br/>
&gt;pleased when he discovered he didn&#39;t die after going LD.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what I was wondering is could bards use this knowledge to somehow help <br/>
&gt;us<br/>
&gt;survive a fight after we go linkdead.  Fear sounds like a good option but<br/>
&gt;then again it could potentially screw over the rest of the group by causing<br/>
&gt;a train.  The new Shield of Songs is a possibility as well.  Third option<br/>
&gt;would be whatever song that you think would best help your party kill the<br/>
&gt;mob(s) you were attacking before you went LD.  That would be situationally<br/>
&gt;dependent on where you were fighting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone got other suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
