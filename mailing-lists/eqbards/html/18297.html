<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717364845">Hmmm...  This could be it, still sounds like a bug to me since it isn&#39;t<br/>
consistent.  It isn&#39;t a big deal I guess, but just leaves me with no low<br/>
level buffs that i can use when we have a good enchanter (IE one who<br/>
would rather haste the bashers then try to be 4th rate wizard)<br/>

&gt; If the enchanter cast Strengthen on people this would cause it.  I found<br/>
&gt; that CoB doesn&#39;t seem to stack with Strengthen consistently.  I seem to<br/>
&gt; remember a problem with CoB stacking with Dextrous Aura as well but its been<br/>
&gt; a while so I&#39;m not certain of that one.  It doesn&#39;t stack with Anthem either<br/>
&gt; but I think that info is in the Song Analysis.<br/>
