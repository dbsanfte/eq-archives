&gt; It&#39;s probably an attack speedup like the enchanter&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Quickness, Alacrity, and Celerity spells.  Curiously there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; no enchanter spell called Haste.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still haven&#39;t gotten around to timing this...<br/>

The ashenwood short spear is a nice weapon on it&#39;s own, but the effect<br/>
on it is really disappointing. For one thing, it won&#39;t go off while<br/>
playing a bard song, as it has to be manually set off by right clicking,<br/>
rather than procing like most weapons. (note the Guise of the Deciever&#39;s<br/>
Dark Elf illusion won&#39;t activate while you are playing a song either,<br/>
and when the effect on that wears off it locks up your songs just like<br/>
procing weapons used to) Also, the spear only has 10 haste charges on it<br/>
and it cannot be recharged.  I dont see why the haste effect isn&#39;t a<br/>
proc like it is on the executioner&#39;s axe. I can&#39;t see it being that<br/>
powerful a weapon with that addition.<br/>
<br/>
Originally I have heard, this weapon was intended to be automaticly<br/>
recharged of a depleted single charge once per everquest day. I also<br/>
heard the same about the formerly buggy spring and harvest crystals. My<br/>
guess is that they couldnt get the code to do this daily recharge<br/>
working so they changed everything that formerly depended on the code<br/>
to be 10 charges and the spear just got caught in the change without<br/>
anyone really thinking about the implications.<br/>
