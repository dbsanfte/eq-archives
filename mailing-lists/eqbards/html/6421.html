<div id="ygrps-yiv-410866900">I have read several postings on this instrument and asked people in-game.  The postings and opinions have not been consistent.<br/>
<br/>
I now have one and I am told it increases non-self healing rate.  I plan to test this tonight; I am interested in others&#39; experiences as well.<br/>
<br/>
My primary question though is: what is it worth?  Has anyone bought one, sold one, or seen one bought or sold?<br/>
