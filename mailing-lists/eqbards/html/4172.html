<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907965948"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yup, this stuff I don&#39;t have much problem with, though as I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; said it should be limited to items appropriate for the level<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is where some people are having the problem.  If you stopped<br/>
right here with your post some would agree.  But you add more with this<br/>
statement.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if you don&#39;t want to lessen the gaming experience.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I have stated earlier some people have a different definition of what<br/>
their gaming experience is.  You may enjoy something that I don&#39;t, and<br/>
someone else may enjoy doing it a different way.  The only time it comes a<br/>
problem is when someone&#39;s gaming enjoyment interferes with anothers.  I used<br/>
my friend at work as an example:  his gaming experience enjoyment consists<br/>
of being able to use cheat codes. If he can&#39;t cheat at a game, he won&#39;t<br/>
play.  My gaming enjoyment is exploration and dying :).  Another friend from<br/>
work has the enjoyment of safety and no death.  As a level 20 druid he has<br/>
died twice.  And another friend from work enjoys tradeskills.  He is a<br/>
master jewelcrafter and is working on blacksmithing now  (which I think<br/>
trade skills are boring).   No one knows what someone&#39;s gaming experience is<br/>
- it is different from everyone.</div>
