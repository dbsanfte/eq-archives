<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283087634">I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say a level 45 wizard can do a good job of keeping the<br/>
HGs cleared or not.  Pull enough lizards and GS to the guard tower (make<br/>
sure the guards are there first) and you will have all the HGs you want.<br/>

&gt; Anyway, I eventually stopped anyway, because a 45th level wizard came<br/>
&gt; in and was doin a pretty good job clearing the area of all but the<br/>
&gt; occasional single pop of HGs (can&#39;t do much with just one!   :)  This was<br/>
&gt; fine.  Fairly done, and the biggest drawback to using charm in the<br/>
&gt; first place.  Lack of mobs to charm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just though I&#39;d share, since it was so rediculously moronic.  :)<br/>
