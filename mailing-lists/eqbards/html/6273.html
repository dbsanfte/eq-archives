<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616721937">If your cleric guildmate was wearing magic resist item and she RM herself so <br/>
that her magic resist is over 100.  The result would be very different.  You <br/>
will never be able to fear or even chain her.  The key to beat a bard in PvP <br/>
is magic resist. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Last night while I was testing out the CoD and DDD with my guildmate we<br/>
&gt; &gt; were in duel mode. While testing, my guildmates would make fun of a bard <br/>
&gt;vs<br/>
&gt; &gt; a cleric how she would wup my ass.  She is a lvl 39 clerics that can <br/>
&gt;solo a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Raider in HK just fine.  While me being a lvl 35 bard cannot even solo a<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard blue guard, haha.	So anyway after my testing (which I posted on<br/>
&gt; &gt; another post), I told her why not duel and find out.<br/>
