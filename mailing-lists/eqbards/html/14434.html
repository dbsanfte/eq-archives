<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019705708">Ok, I ran the test again in BB, this time without my charisma<br/>
equipment, and against a skunk.  It blasted me with its spray<br/>
and took my charisma down to 80:<br/>
<br/>
501 pulses of Lullaby, 80 charisma, lute equipped<br/>
339 successful mesmerizes (67.6%)<br/>
143 secondary resists (28.5%)<br/>
 19 outright resists (3.8%)<br/>
<br/>
To recap my test with the snake:<br/>
<br/>
415 pulses of Lullaby, 154 charisma, lute equipped<br/>
242 successful mesmerizes (58.3%)<br/>
163 secondary resists (39.3%)<br/>
 10 outright resists (2.4%)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to run these tests a couple more times (against a<br/>
snake this time after I&#39;ve been sprayed by skunk musk).  But<br/>
it&#39;s *really* looking like there&#39;s a sign error for the<br/>
charisma enhancement on Lullaby.  With 80 charisma, for the<br/>
first time I was getting secondary resist rates nearly as low<br/>
as the 25% GZ was claiming we should get.<br/>
