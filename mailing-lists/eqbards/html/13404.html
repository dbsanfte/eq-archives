<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428258686">&lt;licking her wounds&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our guild - &lt;The Pantheon&gt; - decided to take on Naggy again.  We rounded up<br/>
our crew and some friends.  We had a great time clearing to the Lair. We had<br/>
5 groups and sent 2 of them back to the Stone Spider room to lessen lag and<br/>
keep it clear for the ones who were arriving later. Only one death along the<br/>
way, our monk puller brought the FG wiz, war, and Magi - got stunned too<br/>
much to successfully feign and went down.  We got mask and crown (crown of<br/>
King Tranix is NOT no drop btw.) <br/>
<br/>
Then the hour long re-group and buff session as we assembled the full crew.<br/>
Finally, we are ready to make the charge when &lt;you have been disconnected&gt;<br/>
Log back in, click on char to re-enter zone and &lt;that zone is not available&gt;<br/>
Grrr.  Now here is where you should have a chat room pre-assigned or log<br/>
your twink.  But -wth- lets just try it again.  Kinda fun entering a fully<br/>
populated Dragon Lair!  Kinda bad seeing 30 or 40 corpses strewn all over in<br/>
the few brief seconds you have before getting smooshed.  Virtually<br/>
_everyone_ in the zone died. All the dragon hunters and all the Doggie<br/>
campers broke camp back into a fully populated zone.  Grrr. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, so now I re-spawn at the spires in Gfay and start to hear the really<br/>
ugly stories from the casters who were binded in the lair.  Some took 5 and<br/>
6 deaths before they could /q out.  Levels lost, 4 and 5 bubs lost. Camii<br/>
(our server&#39;s head GM) comes to the zone and solos everything but the<br/>
dragon.  More guides come and summon ppl from rocks, walls and lava. Someone<br/>
says to contact &quot;somename&quot; and report your exp loses.  No one reports any<br/>
exp being restored by GM&#39;s or Guides - we were all told &#39;sorry, cant help<br/>
you.&quot;  Lev 50 clerics otoh were busy doing what they could.  I do applaud<br/>
our guides and GM&#39;s for doing the best they could with a really bad<br/>
situation - they deserve a lot of credit for the thankless work they do. <br/>
<br/>
Some people had to go at this point and they gated or got gated while the<br/>
rest of us re-assembled and re-buffed.  By now we have heard rumors from the<br/>
other server that FoH fought Naggy and found that he will strip your buffs.<br/>
Never-the-less, we buff up and get ready.  <br/>
<br/>
The plan is half of the groups will go in and make the initial attack while<br/>
the other half wait away from the fight and out of sight.  This works fairly<br/>
well.  The first group took him down to about 80% before we got the call to<br/>
charge!  In we went and I played ele & guardian, dropping to ele only when<br/>
it got too laggy.  I stood near my cleric and saw several resist messages<br/>
and took no fear - not even partials.  My cleric stood his ground as well.<br/>
Unfortuantely, our tanks roamer out of song range and were getting partial<br/>
resists and short fears.  &lt;sigh&gt; if they would only listen.  <br/>
<br/>
We fight and fight and slowly he drops his hp.  He is getting down to 20%<br/>
now and my cleric calls OOM.  I look up and see only 2 or 3 tanks on the<br/>
Dragon and think... hmm well he is below 20 and dropping, he is not casting,<br/>
you have 2 Yks... <br/>

Had this been the &quot;old Nagafen&quot;...... (Naggy got buffed in this last patch<br/>
see p.s. for some observations from Suana)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I will spare you the whining and leave the rest for those who were not<br/>
there to analyze and tell us where we went wrong - always so happy to hear<br/>
from them ;p <br/>
<br/>
Let me offer some tips to those guilds who are considering dragons:<br/>
<br/>
1.	Try to have your leaders tag with other experienced groups and learn<br/>
the geography and sequence of battle.  <br/>
2.	Learn to do the Fire Giants.  More than half the battle is clearing<br/>
to the Lair.  You will get multi-giant pulls.  <br/>
3.	Dragon-wear is now more important than ever.  Camp that Frog King,<br/>
farm some crowns.  Resistance is not futile and with buff stripping, your<br/>
base is gonna matter more.<br/>
4.	Bards are key but their value is lost if the group spreads out of<br/>
song range.  Keep the group in close proximity to each other. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<br/>
p.s. Here is a clip from &quot;Suana&quot; who posted this to our (Innoruuk) server<br/>
list (he tends to rant a bit  but I think his observations are good)<br/>
<br/>
[begin clip]<br/>
Here is some of the ninja-patching we found:<br/>
1) SoundBlaster Live now causes you to crash to windows periodically.<br/>
Apparently programmed to do it just as King Tranix is trying to pound you<br/>
into Paste.  Additional side effect totally uninstalls certain components<br/>
and corrupts the associated .DLL files.<br/>
2) Lord Nagafen got a HP boost AGAIN<br/>
3) Lord Nagafen had a resistance boost to match the resist debuff built into<br/>
the wizard class.  That&#39;s what I gathered from watching him shrug off all<br/>
those Ice Comets.<br/>
4) Lord Nagafen&#39;s breath attack now does damage whether you resist it or<br/>
not.  Resisting only seems to save you half the damage.  The test?  (some<br/>
comment about getting burned here)<br/>
You have resisted the DragonBreath spell!<br/>
You have been slain by Lord Nagafen!<br/>
5) Apparently, they felt dragons still didn&#39;t regenerate fast enough in a<br/>
combat, and took steps.<br/>
6) Dragon fear seems to have been upgraded AGAIN.<br/>
<br/>
[end clip]  Those are Suana&#39;s observations - fwiw.</div>
