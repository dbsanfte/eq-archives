<div id="ygrps-yiv-251733265">Heh charm is two fold to it&#39;s also powerful to npcs. I was camping in sage<br/>
room on my level 50 necro and my pet was duel wielding some 19 and 20 dly<br/>
daggers. Out pops the scribe and gets a  charm on my pet. That was scary he<br/>
beat the crap out of me and then there was a level 49 pet runing around in<br/>
guk. The thing with pets is once charmed always charmed. Was pretty funny<br/>
even though I died.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Just wondering if I could have done this better....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Saturday night in Najena, while waiting for my party<br/>
&gt;to come back (long story, we died and I was bound<br/>
&gt;close.) I wanted to stop by and see if Najena was<br/>
&gt;camped. Being the nutcase that I am, I hit lullaby,<br/>
&gt;(my magic AE door opener.) and find a full spawn.<br/>
&gt;Well, I could fight, or I could die, so I decided to<br/>
&gt;play. I charm magician #1 and sicc her on Najena,<br/>
&gt;while I twist guardian. All the mobs aggro on her<br/>
&gt;(including her own pet) she dies quick. One pulse of<br/>
&gt;charm and the pet suicides. Charm mage #2, sicc her on<br/>
&gt;Najena too. She dies, of course, and I charm the pet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Najena was tougher. I was going to fear/chain her, but<br/>
&gt;it didn&#39;t work too well. I ended up meleeing her,<br/>
&gt;while pixie&#39;ing like mad. She got 2 spells off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All said and done, I nearly died. I was somewhere<br/>
&gt;around 1 bubble after all this fun, and not willing to<br/>
&gt;chance it again. (Damn froglok ghoul almost killed me<br/>
&gt;on the way out.) Any advice on how to do this better<br/>
&gt;next time?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
