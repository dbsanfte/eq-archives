PT Barnam - &quot;There&#39;s a sucker born every minute&quot;  (well actually he DIDN&#39;T<br/>
say that but it&#39;s still true)<br/>
<br/>
No, odds are you&#39;ll never need this.  We have a song for see invis and I<br/>
would have to say that I RARELY need it.  The only time I NEED to see invis<br/>
I&#39;m usually using my own song or a caster in the group casts it on me.<br/>
<br/>
I would say you got amazingly lucky.  A lot of people don&#39;t realize just how<br/>
useless see invis is other than travelling in a group that&#39;s invisible.<br/>
Nice... but not needed.<br/>
<br/>
Lol see if that mage will buy an infravision item for 2000 ;)  hehehe<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] bracer of the hidden<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Won a lotto item from inside the Sarnak castle on the<br/>
&gt; Lake...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bracer of the Hidden, AC 6, all, all<br/>
&gt; effect: see invisible<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rare drop off sarnak legos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was drowned in tells starting at 500 pp.<br/>
&gt; I sold it for 2K to a 54th lvl magician for the<br/>
&gt; &quot;convenience&quot; of being able to see his air pet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Honestly I had no idea anyone would pay that much for<br/>
&gt; it...I would have been overjoyed with 200.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is this:  Am I really goig to need this<br/>
&gt; THAT much at higher lvl?<br/>
