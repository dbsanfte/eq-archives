<div id="ygrps-yiv-461324464"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; &gt; we will most likely also slightly increase<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the durations of DoT spells to compensate for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the additional time necessary to cast the spells<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So it&#39;s also going to take LONGER to cast DoT spells?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, the DoT will last longer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m looking at the part of the message where it<br/>
says &quot;the additional time necessary to cast the spells&quot;<br/>
which to me implies that it&#39;s going to take longer<br/>
than it previously did to cast them. How making it<br/>
take longer to cast a spell is a &quot;benefit&quot; that<br/>
we&#39;re getting because we can&#39;t kite anymore is<br/>
beyond me. Maybe I&#39;m just misunderstanding it.</div>
