courage to harmony, or get a high level person to pull for<br/>
you.  When my friends and I were at the maid/butler, we pulled<br/>
those two rooms, the 3 hall mobs, the 3 in the kitchen, the 4<br/>
gargoyles around the corner, the music room mobs (8 of them),<br/>
and the negotiator room mobs (7? mobs).  <br/>
