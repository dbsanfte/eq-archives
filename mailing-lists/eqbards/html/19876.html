I will be the first to tell that as a bard there is indeed no single<br/>
perfect way to play this class.  Anyone who tells you that should drink<br/>
water out of Rokken, Ziann or Raiel&#39;s boots =).  The power of ourr class<br/>
is the ability to adapt to a situation.  Our myriad of skills allow us to<br/>
function as a lesser version of just about any class.<br/>
<br/>
I too play my bard as a &quot;battle bard&quot;, though like you it would depend on<br/>
the situation and circumstances.  So take pride and pull away... at least<br/>
while you are not in a dungeon ^_^.  <br/>

Party member says, &quot;Where are you Trei?&quot;<br/>
Party casters says, &quot;Where&#39;s the manasong?&quot;<br/>
Party healer says, &quot;Trei why is your health dropping&quot;<br/>
Party cleric says. &quot;Do you want a res?&quot;<br/>
Party tank says, &quot;Where you trying to pull?&quot;<br/>

&gt; I play Jacana as what I call a &quot;battle bard&quot;.  If the group is a well<br/>
&gt; rounded group of 6 then I will &quot;sit back&quot; and play my instruments but if<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s 4 or less Jacana is right there in the fight.  And honestly I like it<br/>
&gt; that way :)<br/>
