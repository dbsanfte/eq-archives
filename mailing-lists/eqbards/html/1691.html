<div id="ygrps-yiv-146761680">That&#39;s because at the time you hit assist, it assists on the last mob to hit<br/>
the player, even if that&#39;s not the mob the player has targetted.  And, a lot<br/>
of times, you&#39;ll find the guy you&#39;re wanting to assist changes targets on<br/>
you, further complicating matters.<br/>

&gt;&gt;         Can&#39;t agree with you more on using the /assist command.  However,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;&gt; have come to the conclusion that the majority of people playing this game<br/>
&gt;&gt; are not aware of the utility of the /assist command.  I always request<br/>
&gt;&gt; people in my group to use the /assist command before we start engaging<br/>
&gt;&gt; enemies.  Almost everytime I do that someone comes back and asks &quot;What is<br/>
&gt;&gt; the /assist command? It isn&#39;t on the Socials menu.&quot;   After I tell them<br/>
what<br/>
&gt;&gt; it does, generally their next response is &quot;Cool, I didn&#39;t know you could<br/>
do<br/>
&gt;&gt; that.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The people in my party use /assist all the time, and we&#39;ve found it to be<br/>
very<br/>
&gt;very buggy.  For some reason, /assist will often have them or their pets<br/>
attack<br/>
&gt;completely different mobs, and we don&#39;t know why.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone else had similar experiences?<br/>
