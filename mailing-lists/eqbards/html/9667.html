&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Plane of Hate<br/>

&gt;Question to all servers once again? Has *any* imbrued armor dropped since <br/>
&gt;the patch on this past<br/>
&gt;Wednesday? The armor was supposedly moved to the plane of hate since it is <br/>
&gt;no longer dropped on<br/>
&gt;boogeymen, but none has dropped yet on any mobs on my server (Tarew Marr). <br/>
&gt;I&#39;m starting to<br/>
&gt;believe Verant forgot to put our stuff in after they jacked it from <br/>
&gt;boogeymen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regarding the Maestro, how far in is he? You said it took 8 hours. And how <br/>
&gt;hard is he? Does he<br/>
&gt;cast any special type of spells?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, when pulling mobs, have you had any weird bugs, where a single mob is <br/>
&gt;pulled, and about 3<br/>
&gt;minutes into the fight, 5 - 10+ mobs come outta no where and wipe out <br/>
&gt;everyone? Even with monks<br/>
&gt;feign pulling, and staying feigned while the rest of us fought so to keep <br/>
&gt;aggro clear, we still<br/>
&gt;get trained everytime.<br/>

<br/>
We had the same problem with train, but it didn&#39;t happen as often as it <br/>
seems to have happened with you.. ?  We killed quite a few mobs, and then <br/>
suddenly a group of them rushes into the room and forces us to evac.<br/>
<br/>
We had to let some nice rogue armor go to waste cuz none was there and one <br/>
of the pallys got a very nice 2 hander (forget what it&#39;s called, but it&#39;s <br/>
dmg 20, del 36, +5 STR, +something INT). We didn&#39;t get to the maestro <br/>
unfortunately because of two long corpse recoveries. =(<br/>
