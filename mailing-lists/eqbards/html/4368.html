 </span></blockquote>I am just so jealous of you all on your feel good severs.  On Rallos Zek we<br/>
can&#39;t stop steal killers using this method.  You can still inflict damage on<br/>
charmed mobs, ince it is at that time considered someone&#39;s pet.  I once<br/>
tried to teach a group of lv 20 steal killers a lesson by charming the mobs<br/>
they were attacking (they stole kill from my girlfriend&#39;s character earlier<br/>
that day).  Needless to say I was laughed at.  On the up side, you CAN charm<br/>
a PK(or fear them for that matter) and have your level 50 wizard friends zap<br/>
the hell out of a player they could otherwise not hit since they have a<br/>
linkdead &quot;flag&quot; set upon becoming charmed or feared.  Now THERE&#39;s some bard<br/>
revenge for you.</div>
