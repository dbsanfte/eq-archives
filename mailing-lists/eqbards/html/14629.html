<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918000847"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   Now to apply that to the issue at hand.  You L25 people, you L35<br/>
&gt;   people, you will be L50 in what 6 more months? 9 more months? <br/>
&gt;   Who cares?  Live up the game to the fullest that it has to offer<br/>
&gt;   you at your current level.  Dragons are just a massive deathtrap.<br/>
&gt;   When the expansion comes out, based on what I&#39;ve said, you&#39;ll find<br/>
&gt;   that you still have plenty of time to build your character to a <br/>
&gt;   level where you finally catch up to the people who are doing <br/>
&gt;   the big things and you will not be excluded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	That all assumes in 6 months when I&#39;m level 50 that I can do the<br/>
same things current level 50s are doing.  If they upgrade dragons/planes<br/>
after the expansion then I may have to wait 12 months or longer to do the<br/>
things I expected to do when I got to 50.  Lets assume after the expansion<br/>
(with a level cap of 60) that it now takes a 55+ person to go on a<br/>
dragon/plane raid.  If I understand what your saying, then I should just<br/>
remain patient until I get to 55th level and then go on raids then (12<br/>
months from now versus 6 months from now).  If this is the case, then sorry<br/>
but I don&#39;t agree with you.  If it takes me 6 months to get to 50 and go on<br/>
a dragon raid, then I can accept that and be patient.  But if the rules get<br/>
changed and I now have to wait 12 months before I can go on a dragon raid,<br/>
then I won&#39;t accept that.  I&#39;ll either retire my bard and play a different<br/>
class or quit the game entirely.<br/>
