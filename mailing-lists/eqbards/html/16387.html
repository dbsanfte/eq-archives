&gt; I have been rethinking song tactics on uber-mobs as well.  Over the weekend<br/>

I&#39;ve never resisted it, but the one time we took on the<br/>
Maestro before I was prepared (17 poison resist, no poison<br/>
resist songs), I lost over a bubble to each lifetap and died<br/>
pretty quickly.  With poison resist at 115+, I take anywhere<br/>
from a negligible amount of damage (hp bar doesn&#39;t move) to<br/>
full damage.  Mostly about 0-1/4 bubble though.<br/>
<br/>
If we can get everyone&#39;s MR over 100 without songs and had two<br/>
healers, I&#39;d probably try Psalm of Purity and use my weapons.  <br/>

does more than [an LDC&#39;s] blood boil.&quot;  :)  I use Niv&#39;s+Hymn<br/>
with a lute when we only have one healer and expect to take a<br/>
lot of distributed damage in a fight (and when people are<br/>
getting DoTed).  It&#39;s a very powerful combination.  Those two<br/>
will basically cancel out the damage a low blue mob does to<br/>
you solo.  You can imagine what it does if you&#39;re grouped.<br/>
