&gt; Sorry, was commenting to the most recent post in the thread.  I don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; problem with it either, just wondered why anyone was questioning Fear/Chains<br/>
&gt; valididty or calling it cheesy when its no different from Fear/Root which<br/>
&gt; Enchanters can do at much lower level.  I agree with you it seems perfectly<br/>
&gt; valid to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking as someone who uses the fear song a lot, fear/chaining certainly<br/>
shouldn&#39;t count as cheesy unless things like kiting are REALLY cheesy.  Fear<br/>
chaining isn&#39;t exactly easy.  Get a few missed notes and a resist or two and<br/>
that thing is turning around and beating on you, unlike kiting, where there is<br/>
basically no risk to yourself.  I&#39;ve died plenty of times while fear/chaining or<br/>
fear/snaring.<br/>
