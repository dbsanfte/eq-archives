<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185299317">i can see the opinion, but NO way we are in lower guk and comes to the point<br/>
of &quot;ok ykesha lotto, shada&#39;s out.&quot; HAHAHAHA, fat chance =)<br/>
<br/>
actually, our lotto&#39;s on rare drops are based on who in the group CAN use<br/>
the item, not who NEEDS the item most.  hence, bards are in lottos on items<br/>
they can use, whether a warrior in the group can use it better.<br/>
<br/>
Shada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>
Erisi Dlarit, Level 23 High Elf Paladin<br/>
Tyria Sarkin, Level 20 High Elf Wizard<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The biggest problem with Bards at later levels, IMO is that <br/>
&gt; most groups<br/>
&gt; (at least on our server) go to item distribution based on need, rather<br/>
&gt; than the various schemes like alpha used by lower levels. I <br/>
&gt; believe this<br/>
&gt; is used on other servers as well. Unfortunately, as the Bard <br/>
&gt; is known as<br/>
&gt; a mediocre fighter and inadequate tank at that point, and the <br/>
&gt; weapons we<br/>
&gt; can use are all weapons multiple classes can use because we <br/>
&gt; have no bard<br/>
&gt; only weapons, there will always be someone in the group who could use<br/>
&gt; the item more than the bard. Why would a group want to give the first<br/>
&gt; Ykesha they find to a bard, who can&#39;t double attack and thus won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; making as effective use of this special weapon as a warrior or ranger.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes eventually your turn will come up, but with the super rare spawn<br/>
&gt; stuff, that eventually can be an awfully long time, and at least for<br/>
&gt; some of us, like other classes in the game, part of the fun comes from<br/>
&gt; having some unique things that make your character special in <br/>
&gt; some way.<br/>
&gt; Having no weapons or armor that are unique pretty well leaves <br/>
&gt; Bards out<br/>
&gt; in the cold as far as that goes.<br/>
