<div id="ygrps-yiv-107109283"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I don&#39;t want the AC so that I can tank...  I want the AC so that I can<br/>
&gt;survive when more than one mob suddenly pops up at your door.  (A lot of my<br/>
&gt;hunting is done in the traditional 6 man group, not multi-group raids, so<br/>
&gt;enchanters aren&#39;t always a luxury).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And enchanters have the exact same problem, with even LESS generic AC than<br/>
bards have. If something resists mez, then it comes straight for the<br/>
enchanter. (And if several things resist. Yikes! Dead enchanter.)<br/>
<br/>
This really isn&#39;t a bard-only problem. And Verant has chosen to<br/>
deal with it in ways other than just giving folk more AC to deal<br/>
with it.</div>
