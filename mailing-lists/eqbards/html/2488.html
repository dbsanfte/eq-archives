<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043244524">Great story Bob. If only someone had been willing to help me the way you <br/>
helped your friend. Instead, I sat on a rock for 4 hours trying to get a gm, <br/>
spoke to guild members and no one knew what to do, and the next day after <br/>
reading suggestions here started swimming. Swam for nearly 4 hours without <br/>
sighting land because I didn&#39;t know the zone was backwards before giving up <br/>
and didn&#39;t get out of OOT untill the next day after reading about the /loc <br/>
command. 2 whole days of what I did not consider very fun. I certainly don&#39;t <br/>
play EQ to spend days futiley trying to get out of a situation that a game <br/>
bug put me into. I love to roleplay, enjoy it immensely, but this ceased to <br/>
be fun long before I used the /loc command and no desire to roleplay could <br/>
possibly justify my spending a minute longer in that futile situation. <br/>
Before you pass judgement try actually putting yourself in that position.<br/>

&gt;Tonight my friend and I owe a debt to the collected bards of Norrath.<br/>
&gt;Riding the boat from Freeport to Butcherblock, just before he entered the<br/>
&gt;Butcherblock area, he suddenly found himself stranded on a rock in the<br/>
&gt;company of aqua goblins.  He got a message to me and I remembered the<br/>
&gt;advice I&#39;d heard hear about swimming for an island with a dock.  He<br/>
&gt;preferred to pray to the bitwise gods, but none seeemed to be listening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So we hatched a plan.  I would take the boat on the same path he did,<br/>
&gt;reporting to him where it was.  I told him the boarding technique I learned<br/>
&gt;so recently in this scrying pool, swim for the boat as if you&#39;re going to<br/>
&gt;climb its prow, and find yourself in the hold by the bar.  I called out the<br/>
&gt;landmarks as they passed, in detail as we entered, sailed through, and<br/>
&gt;beyond the aqua goblin rocks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then I heard my friend&#39;s exultant shout!  He was aboard.  A rescue at sea.<br/>
&gt;And we owe it all to what I learned here from my fellow bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My deepest gratitude for your help in rescuing my friend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Thrush<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We weren&#39;t even tempted to use /loc.  And now we have an in-game story of<br/>
&gt;fear, frustration, anticipation, and rescue, even though it was caused by a<br/>
&gt;stupid software bug.<br/>
