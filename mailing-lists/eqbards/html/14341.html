<br/>
   Ahh, now here&#39;s something I like to see...<br/>
<br/>
   Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the<br/>
      following: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon, Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre,<br/>
      Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike, and Agilmente&#39;s<br/>
      Aria of Eagles? <br/>
<br/>
   A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance,<br/>
      none. <br/>
<br/>
   So, for all you people out there tooting your flutes with charm,<br/>
   I would like you to recall way back when a certain Harmonic said<br/>
   that a flute produced no direct benefit in the charming of monsters.<br/>
   Despite the fact that several people claimed otherwise.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
   As for GZ&#39;s answer to the Piccolo having a greater wind effect,<br/>
   I&#39;ll find my normal flute and see which lowers my magic resistance<br/>
   more with pixie strike again (since GZ did say lowers more magic).<br/>
   The last time I tried it when I got the piccolo, it did absolutely<br/>
   nothing which i could measure.<br/>
<br/>
   I also tried to pixie a few guk/bok frogs in the king room last<br/>
   night.  With a base CHA of 130 something, weapons in hand, I could<br/>
   pretty much shutdown any enemy.  In the 50 or so tries I made, I<br/>
   only got two outright resists, and probably 20 or so of the attempts<br/>
   will &#39;mob didnt mez&#39;.  If you get &#39;mob didnt mez&#39; 3 times in a row<br/>
   you can expect it to attack the next round.  I switched to flute<br/>
   with same CHA, and I noticed an ever so slight drop in &#39;mob didnt<br/>
   mez&#39; as it continued to stick over and over.  When the shaman buffed<br/>
   my CHA up above 170, I saw no impact or change in the secondary<br/>
   resist messages. /shrug  Again, I don&#39;t have the raw numbers because;<br/>
   well you let the froglok king, two boks, and two jins beat the crap<br/>
   out of you for a few minutes and you kinda want to just kill them.<br/>
<br/>
   With my weapons in hand and CHA 130, I can hold a scarling or<br/>
   spider in Fear with little or no problems (once the first pixie <br/>
   takes).  I haven&#39;t tried any other mobs.  The mobs in hate have<br/>
   such insane magic resistances that any pixie I try is outright<br/>
   resisted.  Until Malosi or Tash is in I usually don&#39;t get very <br/>
   far (flute or not) - however, the flute does help significantly<br/>
   in hate for continual pixie striking.<br/>
