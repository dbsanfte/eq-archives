<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676491094">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
Hail and well met everyone ) I&#39;m a new member to this list and I play a<br/>
Bard of the 18th Song. I was wondering if anyone had any preferences as to<br/>
what weapons you Duel Wield. Currently I am using a PGT and Combine<br/>
Scimitar. The only other character I have is a Cleric so I really don&#39;t<br/>
have much experience with melee weaps and though I expect I will be playing<br/>
instruments most of the time, I was wondering what you all use.  Any<br/>
suggestions? Thanks<br/>
