<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861444413">Here&#39;s how I maxed Brass Instruments and raised Hand-to-Hand from a pathetic 1:<br/>
<br/>
Each time I walked through High Pass and it was particularly well-camped, I would whip out my horn, stand by <br/>
the corner nearest all the spawn points, and play Denon&#39;s.  If any Orcs showed up, I would attack with my <br/>
fists.  While not necessary for raising skills, I also positioned myself to affect as many Orcs as possible.  <br/>
You should only do this when it is well-camped, so the other frenzied groups tank for you.  <br/>
<br/>
On at least three occasions, I was able to get credit for four Orcs at once, even though they were being <br/>
attacked by multiple groups (and solo Wizards) around me (gotta love that &quot;random&quot; number generator).  (Not <br/>
sure how well this works with the new anti-DOT rules, I&#39;ve been out of town for three weeks.)  Curiously <br/>
enough, I was never accused of kill stealing.  Other players, however, really HATE the pulse message that the <br/>
song generates.  I would constantly get messages like:  &quot;Kenross, what are you trying to cast on me?&quot;, <br/>
&quot;Kenross, stop that!&quot; and the ubiquitous &quot;KENROSS, SHUT UP!!!!!!!&quot;.  I also got a lot of threats about <br/>
reporting me to the GM for spamming them.  I finally got disgusted and set up a social key:<br/>
<br/>
Kenross says &quot;I am practicing my feeble Brass skills.&quot;<br/>
Kenross says &quot;It is an area damage song.&quot;<br/>
Kenross says &quot;It is my only Brass Instruments song.&quot;<br/>
Kenross says &quot;I am not PVP, so it won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;<br/>
Kenross says &quot;Sorry for the annoyance, complain to Verant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to maximize your kills there, you could weave in the Level 2 song and the Bellow also, but I <br/>
was being lazy.<br/>

PS - Anyone care to guess why so many Bards on this board are from my server?  Just curious.<br/>

&gt; another nice way to raise brass is if you&#39;re pulling stuff from a very<br/>
&gt; remote spot, while the rest of the group meds just fire up brass in the<br/>
&gt; meantime if no roamers around you, i have started doing this lately and its<br/>
&gt; slowly making my skill come back up to par..<br/>

&gt; &gt;       No, I&#39;ve had it go way up whilst sitting in the corner of South<br/>
&gt; &gt; Karana<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing Discord and absolutely nothing was around. It does take time for<br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; to go up though...<br/>

&gt; &gt; 8)Ok,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8)  This has probably been asked before, but HOW IN THE<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8)WORLD can one practice Brass?  It seems that unless<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8)you are actually damaging something, brass skill won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8)go up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8)<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8)Can anyone help out with this?<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8)<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8)Thanks<br/>
