<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-590998818">A few nights ago I was hunting in Permafrost with a bunch of friends.<br/>
However one of my friends is a level 17 rogue so we all decided to make<br/>
some pulls to help him gain a level or so.  As usual I ran in and made a<br/>
pull and drag some gobs out.  To ensure that they were agro on me I played<br/>
a healthly mixture of Lullaby and chains if it attacked my rogue friend.<br/>
Now what I did notice was the fact that my chains never, not even once<br/>
held on a gob that was running away. An I am 100% sure that some of these<br/>
gobs did not have any chance for a SoW to be cast on them.  SO I wanted to<br/>
ask if anyone else has had a similar problem.<br/>
