<b>Subject:</b> Crowd control and lament pulling (was grouping thread on the Ever quest boards) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-701609164">OK here is how I tell my groups I will handle crowd control.  First off, the<br/>
decision on when to use crowd control songs is totally dependent on if the<br/>
group has an enchanter or not.  In groups with an enchanter, I let him know<br/>
that I have charm and pixie strike memmed for special situations.  The<br/>
enchanter has primary crowd control duties and I focus on buffing the party<br/>
and damaging the mob.  Pixie is memmed primarily for interrupting casters<br/>
and charm is memmed to get mobs off the enchanter or in case he is OOM.  If<br/>
the group plays smart and the enchanter knows what he is doing, then I will<br/>
likely not have to use these songs very often for crowd control.  <br/>
<br/>
If the group doesn&#39;t have an enchanter, then I inform the party that I will<br/>
always be using charm and pixie strike if we get more than one mob.  I also<br/>
inform them that in those situations I will not be using weapons in melee.<br/>
A lot of non-bards are not aware that we can inflict a lot of damage with<br/>
our DOT songs and a drum equipped.  When we get multiple mobs, I fire up<br/>
Celerity to buff up the melee folks, target and charm the 2d mob and have it<br/>
attack mob #1, hit the mob 31 with FCC, and then start back over with<br/>
Celerity.  If there is no lag and assuming the 2d mob doesn&#39;t resist charm,<br/>
I can weave all 3 songs and keep the 2d mob charmed the entire time.  Now if<br/>
I wanted to I could pixie strike the 2d mob and keep him out of the fight<br/>
with that song.  But  because the charmed mob can inflict more melee damage<br/>
than I can, the 1st mob will die much faster if I use charm.  <br/>
<br/>
In pulls with 3 or more mobs, its often difficult to charm a mob and have it<br/>
attack the mob that the tanks are fighting.  So I don&#39;t worry about it too<br/>
much.  In fact, if I can get the charmed mob to attack the mob that isn&#39;t<br/>
engaged, then it works out for the best.  Everyone else is engaging one mob,<br/>
my pet is taking care of the 3d.  So what ends up happening is that even<br/>
though we pulled 3 mobs, only one is inflicting damage on the party.  In<br/>
situations like this, you will want to try and get some distance between you<br/>
and the 2d & 3d mob so when charm wears off, you have time to get it back up<br/>
before two mobs start attacking you.  Alternatively, you could pixie strike<br/>
the 2d and 3d mobs if you want.  This would reduce the amount of damage the<br/>
mobs are inflicting but would increase the amount of time required to kill<br/>
all three since the 2d and 3d mobs aren&#39;t attacking one another.  <br/>
<br/>
In situations without an encahnter where you get 4 or more mobs, then the<br/>
best option depends on where you are at.  In an outdoor zone, especially in<br/>
Kunark, then the best method for crowd control is to use the snare/fear<br/>
combo (chains if no ranger or druid in the group, also you can use engulfing<br/>
darkness if a SK or necro is in the group).  In these situations, everyone<br/>
attacks the snared mob while you fear the others away.  I&#39;ve used this<br/>
strategy successfully on numerous occasions in the Overthere, Frontier Mtns,<br/>
and Dreadlands.  <br/>
<br/>
Lament pulling is an art.  But since most groups want the bard to stay back<br/>
and sing mana song while someone else pulls, not many bards get a chance to<br/>
practice this a lot.  I myself have only used it sparingly so everything<br/>
from here on out is either what I&#39;ve personally done or read about on this<br/>
list.  First off, if you are indoors and have a monk or outdoors and have a<br/>
ranger, then by all means let them pull.  But if your group doesn&#39;t have one<br/>
of these two classes, then the bard can serve as a capable substitute.<br/>
First thing you want to do is max out your charisma stat as high as you can<br/>
get it.  Then equip the lute.  So lets say you find a room with 3 spawns in<br/>
it.  First thing to do is figure out how close you need to be to get the<br/>
first mob within range of the target.  You&#39;ll get a message if you are to<br/>
far away.  Lull the closest mob (you get the message &quot;a mob is sad&quot;).  Move<br/>
a little closer until you can target the next closest mob.  Rinse and repeat<br/>
until you get all mobs Lulled.  The back off and use a song to aggro the<br/>
first mob.  I prefer chains since if it sticks, you can get back to the<br/>
party without taking any damage.  Depending how long it takes you to kill<br/>
the first mob, the other mobs may still be Lulled when you go back to pull<br/>
them.  Probably a good idea though to Lament them again.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now here is something important to consider when using a bard to lament<br/>
pull.  First off, if there is no monk or ranger in the group, then using a<br/>
bard can only have positive effects.  Any other class who pulled would<br/>
automatically pull all three mobs.  A bard has a chance of pulling singles.<br/>
So even if the mobs resist and all three aggro, then the situation is no<br/>
different had another class pulled.  The biggest concern a bard should have<br/>
when lament pulling is surviving a bad pull.  All three mobs will be aggro<br/>
on the bard in this situation.  A cleric in the group is almost a<br/>
requirement.  If no cleric then I would be wary being the primary puller.<br/>
If there is an enchanter in thr group, then the risk is reduced since he can<br/>
mez the extra mobs.  One other thing you can do is make sure a tank who can<br/>
Taunt knows that all the extra mobs will be on you.  He may need to peel off<br/>
the main mob everyone is attacking and taunt the extra mobs off of you.  <br/>
<br/>
One last thing to remember when lament pulling.  Lament reduces the aggro<br/>
range of the mobs you Lull.  But the aggro range is still there.  So if you<br/>
successfully Lull all three mobs and pull the closest one, if it is standing<br/>
very close to the other two, it can cause the other mobs to aggro even<br/>
though you Lulled them. <br/>
<br/>
I think that about covers it.  If I left something out someone else please<br/>
cover it.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve got 2 questions about Crowd control and lament pulling. <br/>
<br/>
On crowd control, how do you get a group to let you do it?  Every time<br/>
I try charm, mez or selective fear someone (often more than one) freaks<br/>
out.  Last time I dared use charm (to pull a stoneleer off our<br/>
enchanter, help healer, add damage, list goes on) the monk in the party<br/>
took my head off for the audacity of not letting him tank 3 mobs at<br/>
once.  Is it just me falling into groups who refuse to try new things<br/>
or what?  I miss HK when people would be yelling at me if I didn&#39;t<br/>
charm/mez fast enough.  Tho, I&#39;ve noticed Pixie Strike having it&#39;s mez<br/>
portion resisted 7/10 times on any blue con mob or above, only slightly<br/>
better with instrument.  Is this a function of my cha (136) or do the<br/>
rumors I hear of it sucking soon after you get it ring true?  It&#39;s<br/>
scary that Solon&#39;s is more reliable than Pixie.<br/>
<br/>
And on Lament, using it at all.  It worked nicely when I first got it<br/>
and I loved it for a long time but haven&#39;t used it since the early<br/>
twenties.  Every time I tried to use it I got a resist and the mob<br/>
(plus friends) aggroed on me and ground me into bardpaste.  Even with<br/>
lute it&#39;s dangerous at best.  I&#39;d like any advice you folks have on<br/>
it&#39;s proper uses.<br/>
