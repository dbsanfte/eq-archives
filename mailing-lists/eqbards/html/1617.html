&gt;On the same type of thread, yesterday I picked up 2 Illegible Cantrips from<br/>
&gt;some orcs we slew.  What exactly are they, I tried to sell them but to no<br/>
&gt;avail.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The illegible cantrips are part of a quest involving an NPC wizard (I <br/>
think..) found on the lower floor of the building at the entrance to the <br/>
enchanter/wizard/magician area in Freeport. Forgive the lack of detail but <br/>
it was awhile ago that I attempted to complete the quest (without success <br/>
due to my class). The building is the one you must teleport into by using <br/>
the teleport pad just outside of it. It is the compound area with the 2 <br/>
magic users casting outside the &quot;gate&quot; of it.<br/>
