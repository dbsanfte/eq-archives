<div id="ygrps-yiv-856863158">I can&#39;t disagree on this at all. As a matter of fact, I was going to put <br/>
the very words in my post &quot;why have them at all?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I ever use pixie strike right now is to interrupt spell <br/>
casters. It&#39;s pretty effective in that regard. It&#39;d be very powerful it it <br/>
would stun the mob, but maybe it&#39;d be too powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby would be an extremely powerful song if it worked even close to the <br/>
enchanter&#39;s AOE spell. At it&#39;s present state it really only is an AOE <br/>
taunt. :-P  Verant is looking at the play balance issues and I respect <br/>
that. But if they believe that the only way to keep play balance is to make <br/>
the resists so high and the duration so iffy, then I agree, why have this <br/>
song in the first place? They say that this song is working as they see <br/>
fit. I can see why they wouldn&#39;t want bards running rampant in a dungeon <br/>
keeping everything mez&#39;d. But I can&#39;t see why any bard would ever use this <br/>
song then.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Verant should think of adding their &quot;mana&quot; component to this song <br/>
and increasing our chances of mezing with Lullaby? That may take care of <br/>
their worries about bards running nilly willy mezing everything in sight?<br/>
