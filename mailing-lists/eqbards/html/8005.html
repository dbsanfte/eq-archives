<div id="ygrps-yiv-136692097">no way an exploit for using one of our songs cleverly hehe.  a druid friend<br/>
and i found that little passage a few months ago, before any dragons were<br/>
killed on any servers.  that&#39;s when we conned all the guards in her lair as<br/>
level 49 or 50.  pretty scary for 2 level 50s prancing around Vox&#39;s lair<br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
we haven&#39;t been able to do Vox either.  got nagafen a few times but on the<br/>
most recent raid it was a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Nagafen says, &quot;You will not evade me Shada.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
everyone there heard that about 20 times each hehe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; At least on our server, the GM&#39;s have told us that using that <br/>
&gt; way in to<br/>
&gt; do a Vox raid would be considered an exploit. They do have a huge agro<br/>
&gt; range too. On our server, we&#39;ve managed Nagafen, but Vox kicked our<br/>
&gt; butts. </span></blockquote></div>
