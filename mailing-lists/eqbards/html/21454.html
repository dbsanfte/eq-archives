<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154515083">Look at Kunark, the size of the zones, the lack of teleport points, the<br/>
convoluted quests that involve insane amounts of camping rare spawns and<br/>
running around.  Verants ENTIRE aim, in my opinion, is to SLOW US DOWN.  In<br/>
fact, when the first member of our guild with a VP key went and peeked in,<br/>
he was told by a GM something to the effect of &quot;First FoH, then Afterlife,<br/>
now  you.. you guys weren&#39;t supposed to be in VP for six months.&quot;  Don&#39;t<br/>
know how true that is, but to me they are looking for ways to slow us down<br/>
even more.  Its funny that a game as &quot;successful&quot; as EQ that the players are<br/>
at actual WAR with creators.<br/>

&gt; The reason for the uproar is that the ENTIRE game up to this <br/>
&gt; point has been<br/>
&gt; tested and balanced with the &#39;haste bug&#39; in place.  All those <br/>
&gt; fast spawning<br/>
&gt; kunark dungeons we are supposed to due are now going to be <br/>
&gt; much harder, as<br/>
&gt; either the groups will be killing things slower or spending <br/>
&gt; more mana to<br/>
&gt; kill things at the same pace.  Either way total combat time (battle +<br/>
&gt; recovery) will be longer as more mana will be spent (more <br/>
&gt; mana for haste or<br/>
&gt; more mana for healing/damage spells).  The PvE balance is <br/>
&gt; about to get a<br/>
&gt; huge push, to the detrement of the players.<br/>

&gt; &gt; *snip haste stacking bug being fixed*<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Not a poke at you specifically, Olgwinn, just an observation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was reading the Concert Hall board last night.  Why are people so<br/>
&gt; &gt; upset about this being fixed?  It has historically been <br/>
&gt; referred to as<br/>
&gt; &gt; the &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find <br/>
&gt; it.  Well,<br/>
&gt; &gt; its been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work <br/>
&gt; that way and<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask <br/>
&gt; them to fix<br/>
&gt; &gt; bugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* <br/>
&gt; bug!&quot;  A bug<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of<br/>
&gt; &gt; our overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.  <br/>
&gt; Could happen.<br/>
