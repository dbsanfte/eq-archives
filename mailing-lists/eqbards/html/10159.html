<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445524019">I have been there a few times in the past few weeks during evening primetime <br/>
and rarely were there more than 4 ppl in the zone..usually no one was there. <br/>
 Glad I got the drop from Kurrpok already :-) because if it turns into a <br/>
Kithicor like zone I won&#39;t be going back for a while.<br/>

&gt;&gt;From the Druid&#39;s Grove:<br/>
&gt;----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;Saturday night Test was treated to a rare GM event in which high level <br/>
&gt;(high<br/>
&gt;20&#39;s to mid-30&#39;s) gnolls were in South Karana running around killing <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;like most typical GM events seem to be. I did not participate but today <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;friends told me that afterwards SplitPaw had been revamped in much the <br/>
&gt;same<br/>
&gt;way that Kithicor has and to come check it out. I have not had a chance <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;do so much yet but I can say that the level has been increased to about <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;30-50 lvl dungeon from what I have seen and heard with gnolls conning <br/>
&gt;blue<br/>
&gt;to me at 40th at the first bridge area. Not sure if it has been reitemized<br/>
&gt;but I am hoping it will be, if so it will be another nice upgrade to <br/>
&gt;a zone<br/>
&gt;that Verant has made recently. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Agreed -- lower level players rarely went to Paw, probably because of <br/>
&gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;distance. So, now that most of our players are approaching mid-level,<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;changed the zone&#39;s population (and treasure) in hopes it will be more<br/>
&gt;popular now. <br/>
