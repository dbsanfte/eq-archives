&gt;Try remaping the attack key to something even more usuless, like the `/~ key<br/>
&gt;or the + key on the VERY FAR right of the keyboard.  I have found if I<br/>
&gt;mistype I usually hit the key too far inside rather then outside, and have<br/>
&gt;fewer deaths for poor typing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh - I remapped it to &#39;x&#39; - it&#39;s close and convenient, without there being<br/>
a chance of me typing it before I realize I mistyped. Think about it -<br/>
unless you&#39;re talking about OOC stuff (which you shouldn&#39;t be to an NPC),<br/>
there&#39;s no possible way to hit &#39;x&#39; before I hit &#39;space&#39; which is jump.<br/>
<br/>
Makes more sense now that I rationalize it, since it was a rather arbitrary<br/>
decision to begin with *grins*<br/>
<br/>
Talies the rationalizer<br/>

ANd to avoid kabongs, I just started using melodic binding today - I<br/>
thought it slowed creatures MOVEMENT down, not just attacks... Anyone want<br/>
to change the title on the message and correct me?</div>
