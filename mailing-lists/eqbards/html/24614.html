<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589707118">Heh..that mask has been the bane of my existence.  I happen to think the<br/>
coolest looking thing is a Dark Elf bard in Lambent...it&#39;s just too too<br/>
cool.  So I spent some serious time trying to get that mask, and have been<br/>
frustrated at every turn (the archives of this list has the full story<br/>
somewhere, I&#39;m sure, if anyone is so inclined. heh..).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the middle of moving, so not much EQ time.  The cable account is<br/>
being switched next week, so I at least still can connect (I hope, haven&#39;t<br/>
looked lately...heh).  So, as long as I still have the inet connection at<br/>
home, I&#39;ll be going for 32 tonight.  Then I figure with the high-test mana<br/>
song, getting a LGuk group should be fairly easy...I hope!<br/>
<br/>
The bag would be a bonus, but I&#39;m not even going to think of that until I&#39;m<br/>
masked.  :)<br/>

No virus here, I didn&#39;t even see a quarantine message from the server. <br/>

I have yet to go to an LARP/SCA event, but I have enjoyed making costumes<br/>
for our Excalibur Gathering last year. I don&#39;t go to SCA lengths but try to<br/>
make period pieces that look authentic without spending a ton. They come in<br/>
handy at Halloween and when we go to the Medival Faires also.<br/>
Snicker&#39;s Amtgard site was long the memory tag I searched for to find the<br/>
early EQ bard song lists also. There is/was a link off his site.<br/>
<br/>
Atonal: no mask yet?! Be sure and hang around and try for a bag off the<br/>
supplier. Same room and it&#39;s his common drop. I just got the Erudite<br/>
illusion mask the other week. Makes my kylong legs look much better with my<br/>
green bp and arms and hides my imbrued boots.<br/>
