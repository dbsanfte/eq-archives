That number is actually a little misleading, Slyde.<br/>
Bloodpledge licenses on a different scale, using a weird &quot;site-licensing&quot;<br/>
for Internet Gaming cafes.  So, where 400,000 subscribers in EQ represents<br/>
400,000 people, 2.7m for Bloodpledge might not be as representative as you<br/>
think.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Anyway, have you heard of the TWO persistent world (massive multiplayer)<br/>

&gt; &gt;of the Rings games which&#39;re supposed to come out soon?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
