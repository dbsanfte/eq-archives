<b>Subject:</b> Weaknesses to invisibility song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333513123">Couple things I&#39;ve learned about the invisibility song.<br/>
<br/>
1) The effect does not &quot;linger&quot; if your party members move out<br/>
of range like other bard songs do.  When they move out of<br/>
range, they immediately blink into sight.  This seriously<br/>
decreases its usefulness for group movement and corpse<br/>
recovery.<br/>
<br/>
2) If one of your party members blinks into sight and is<br/>
attacked, then moves back into the song&#39;s influence, the next<br/>
song tick the mobs will start attacking you even though you<br/>
are still invisible.  Your song helped someone being attacked,<br/>
so they will now attack you, invisibile or not.<br/>
<br/>
3) My friends were telling me that the song was canceling<br/>
their invisibility to undead.<br/>
<br/>
In short, the song is probably only useful in solo play, and<br/>
if your group is not moving.  Disappointing to say the least.<br/>
Anyone know if it&#39;s intended to be this way?  Perhaps we could<br/>
petition to get (1) fixed.  The effect does &quot;linger&quot; with you<br/>
for two ticks if you stop singing.<br/>
