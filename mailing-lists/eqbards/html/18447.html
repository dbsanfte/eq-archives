LOL.  What you ran into is someone who started a bard as their secondary<br/>
character.   Odds are she was twinked to hell and doesn&#39;t know the first<br/>
thing as to how to play a bard.  I&#39;d be surprised if she&#39;s ever used<br/>
anything but selo&#39;s, hymn, and anthem ;)<br/>
<br/>
People who play bards badly are the reason that others think we&#39;re a weak<br/>
class though ;)  So no nerfs ;)  Let &#39;em continue to think we&#39;re weak I say!<br/>
<br/>
/em cheers on the idiot bards!<br/>
<br/>
hehehe keep the morons so those of us that know our class can enjoy it more<br/>
(without nerfs ;)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; IMO, to successfully use this technique on a consistent basis you need to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; going against blues.  Yellows and reds may resist too much.  Could still<br/>
&gt; work but you make take a lot of damage.  Against blues I don&#39;t lose much<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; all with this technique.  Start off with chain, then fear and then start<br/>
&gt; whacking them from behind.  I&#39;ve been using Furfils as the 3d song to<br/>
debuff<br/>
&gt; their resist rate.  Bellow might be a good option for you.  Biggest thing<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be concerned with is that you don&#39;t aggro a second mob while chasing the<br/>
&gt; first one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a similar note:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Grouped with another 35 bard last night on E&#39;ci in Frontier Mtns.  Lots of<br/>
&gt; blues in their for us to fight.  Told her I intended to use the chain/fear<br/>
&gt; technique.  She had never heard of the technique before.  She told me not<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; pull any casters.  I told her to continuously pixie strike the caster to<br/>
&gt; interrupt their casts.  With both of us doing it we shouldn&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; problems.  She said 1) I weave 4 songs ALL the time, never just one and 2)<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; never fight casters if I can avoid it.  I then asked her if she read this<br/>
&gt; list or Concert Hall board.  Said she didn&#39;t have time for message boards<br/>
&gt; and hated mailing list spam.  I tried my best to tell her about some of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; tricks bards could use to defeat mobs.  She said BAH I&#39;m a tank.  I<br/>
laughed<br/>
&gt; to myself.  Pulled a mob and was killing it easily when another mob joined<br/>
&gt; in.  She just kept swinging away on first mob so I backed out, charmed the<br/>
&gt; second one and had it finish off the first mob.  Then noticed she had quit<br/>
&gt; the group.  Was already low in HPs so decided to zone instead of fighting<br/>
&gt; the second mob.  Saw her on the other side and tore into her.  She said<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; dropped the group because I backed out of the fight and she was taking all<br/>
&gt; the damage.  I asked her if she was aware of how our charm song was used.<br/>
&gt; She said BAH our charm song was a wasted song and that she never used it.<br/>
&gt; On a whim I asked her what her max charisma was.  She came back with 89.<br/>
&gt; She then started to criticize me for trying to use &quot;bard tricks&quot; to defeat<br/>
&gt; mobs instead of pure melee.  At that point I decided she was a lost cause<br/>
&gt; and I wasn&#39;t gonna try to educate her anymore on how to play a bard.  It<br/>
&gt; just strikes me as odd that at this stage of the game you still find<br/>
players<br/>
&gt; who have no freaking idea how to play their class.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Our two main weapons...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our two main weapons are Selo&#39;s, Chains, and Screech... Our three main<br/>
&gt; weapons...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But seriously, I expect to get Screech tonite and was hoping to get some<br/>
&gt; better understanding of how I might put Screech and Chains to work in the<br/>
&gt; wide open expanses of Lake of Ill Omen and The Overthere.  Perhaps some of<br/>
&gt; the more experienced bards can shed some light on this?<br/>

&gt; Nearly 26th and still no last name...<br/>
