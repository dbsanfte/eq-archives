<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623712921">The good thing is that there were two other 44+ bards from the guild there<br/>
to revenge me.  The 39 charm song is downright nasty in duels against pet<br/>
classes.  Our guild had three 45+ mages participating and they got to<br/>
experience first hand what it felt like to fight their own pets:-)  We had a<br/>
standing agreement to stop all duels at one bub of health just in case dying<br/>
to a pet in the PVP area of the Arena caused EXP loss.  <br/>
<br/>
We did run into what might be a possible bug.  A bard charmed a mage and had<br/>
him attack his pet.  Somehow or another, when the charm wore off, the pet<br/>
was still aggro on the owner and would not respond to pet commands.  The<br/>
mage died quickly and the pet started attacking other people as well.<br/>
Fortunately, the mage did not lose any EXP from the death.  <br/>

Hehe, well you were fighting against a 7 level xp gap.  And he had 2 whole<br/>
spell levels on you.  Not exactly a healthy combination.  I think ya did<br/>
pretty good to do as well as you did.<br/>
