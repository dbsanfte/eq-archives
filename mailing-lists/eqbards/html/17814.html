<b>Subject:</b> ugh, shutting bards out of lotto getting more widespread <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-13599803">tonight i found out that no longer will bards in our guild be allowed on<br/>
lotto for haste items, ever. (unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>
<br/>
2 cloak of flames dropped off nagafen last time (i wasn&#39;t there or i<br/>
would&#39;ve known about this sooner) and bards were excluded in the lotto.  no<br/>
more runed bolster belts will be going to bards either.  (fbss only likely<br/>
one now, and only then if no other guild members that need it are in group<br/>
according to guild rules)<br/>
<br/>
i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>
different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
<br/>
i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the leaders of the guild<br/>
are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they don&#39;t need a haste<br/>
item. (even tho they stack)  being a huge guild, the leaders get whines and<br/>
rants all the time, so our chances of convincing them otherwise is very<br/>
slim.<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?</div>
