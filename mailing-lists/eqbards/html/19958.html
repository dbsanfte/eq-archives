<div id="ygrps-yiv-154885710">Actually that guy has always been there.  Maybe he&#39;s been replaced by<br/>
Fabian.  He did sing after a while for me.  Can&#39;t remember his name offhand<br/>
though I know it wasn&#39;t Fabian before.<br/>

OMG!  Is that right??  I saw a bard in there (well, all i could remember was<br/>
it was a tavern in freeport - east i thought) and he had a sword and a<br/>
lute! - I even posted that just recently as a possible place to look!  he<br/>
also had some dialog and kept saying he was going to sing/play but never<br/>
did.  Possibly this is the link back to the one in Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if they also fixed the &quot;ask me later about a special bardic<br/>
weapon...&quot; in Sol Ro.<br/>

&gt; Now, to encourage other threads... I heard a rumour today that Fabian was<br/>
&gt; seen in the Grub&#39;n&#39;Grog in Freeport - any confirmations?<br/>
