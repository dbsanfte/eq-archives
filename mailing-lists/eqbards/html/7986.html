<div id="ygrps-yiv-390125635">The sex of the art director means nothing.  As a female who has worked in <br/>
three highly technical and previously all-male (as well as still 95% male)<br/>
fields.  I will say that some of the most discrimanatory and backwards (as to<br/>
sexism) statements and decisions have been made by females.  Who either:<br/>
 - honestly believe they are inferior<br/>
 - fear challenging a male as a &quot;lone&quot; female may cost them thier job at the<br/>
   extreme, or some peer respect at a minimum (often it does)<br/>
 - are trying to prove they can be &quot;one of the boys&quot; and understand the<br/>
   male world (not always bad - but means you&#39;ll see females making oddly <br/>
   male choices).<br/>
<br/>
One example.<br/>
I was once called on the carpet and emphatically told to &quot;never, ever again<br/>
ask a question of a male in a meeting when the question *may* lead him to<br/>
discover that something could have been done better (and thus insult him)&quot;<br/>
in the late 80&#39;s BY A FEMALE.  Of course, the muckety-muck male, who&#39;s<br/>
response<br/>
to my technical question was &quot;I&#39;ll look into that&quot;, was incredibly pleased<br/>
I&#39;d given him a good question to ask his techies and thrilled when they fixed<br/>
the problem and made him LOOK GOOD!  The techies in question were my office<br/>
mates and had been dying for resources or an excuse to fix that problem, and<br/>
thanked me for creating the opportunity to get it &quot;air time&quot; at the<br/>
muckety-muck<br/>
level so they could fix it. The male was ever after appreciative of my<br/>
technical<br/>
problem solving to the point of wanting me to transfer to his group, and the <br/>
female became a deadly political enemy.  We were the only two females in<br/>
the area.<br/>
The company was no backwoods small shop, but the state headquarters for one<br/>
of the<br/>
top 3 phone/internet providers in the country.  <br/>
<br/>
Sure, EQ graphics are very sexist.  I&#39;m a female, and knowing what I know <br/>
about internet and RPG likely customers, I very well might have decided that<br/>
the current graphics were the right job decision.  Yep, as a female.  Its<br/>
still sexist, and I still hate the lack of graphics which would appeal to <br/>
female player.<br/>

&gt;&gt; It seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Heh. So many people say this but in fact the art director was a woman. </span></blockquote></div>
