<div id="ygrps-yiv-707583547">yes i do the same thing, i should have mentioned it.  its always best to be<br/>
last in the group to make sure you never leave anyone behind, where you are<br/>
auto-following instead of being followed.  good point.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have found the /follow command to be a lifesaver for <br/>
&gt; travelling in groups<br/>
&gt; &gt; with selo&#39;s.  the only time you could not use it is in <br/>
&gt; areas that are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; wide-open or dangerous, like lavastorm, where you would not <br/>
&gt; use it anyway.<br/>
&gt; &gt; as far as long distance travels tho, auto-follow is awesome.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow definately makes life a lot easier than previously, <br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; finding, even in open areas, that due to the weird client prediction<br/>
&gt; bugs and people&#39;s wide variation in ping times it can still screw up a<br/>
&gt; lot. I&#39;ve found it works best if I dont have people set follow to me,<br/>
&gt; but to someone who&#39;s about the slowest in the party. Then I <br/>
&gt; follow that<br/>
&gt; person too, that puts me in the middle of the group instead of ahead,<br/>
&gt; making it more likely I will keep everyone under the effect of Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; However this often also results in my client deciding the person I was<br/>
&gt; following turned right and ran in a circle a couple of times then<br/>
&gt; disappeared, when in fact they continued in a straight line. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A good trick I used to use before the follow patch that can still be<br/>
&gt; useful is when you are leading with Selo&#39;s and need to slow <br/>
&gt; down to let<br/>
&gt; people catch up, instead of stopping, which usually causes <br/>
&gt; most of your<br/>
&gt; party to also stop to see why you stopped, crouch while running, which<br/>
&gt; will slow you down considerably. <br/>
