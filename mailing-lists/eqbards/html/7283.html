<div id="ygrps-yiv-68764034">I have been told that you can train someone to one point over your actual <br/>
rating. So the process, if this is true, would be simple but time consuming. <br/>
Person A trains person B to A&#39;s skill+1. Person B zones trains person A to <br/>
B&#39;s skill+1. Person A zones, rinse and repeat.  I have not been able to <br/>
verify this myself though.<br/>
