<div id="ygrps-yiv-356218413"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is it just me, or has there been a new language filter implemented in the<br/>
&gt; last few months?  I&#39;ve noticed it off an on since I got back - wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
&gt; what I was seeing until I really started watching.  Seems like most of<br/>
&gt; George Carlin&#39;s &quot;10 words&quot; are now &quot;censored&quot; by being converted to<br/>
&gt; &quot;garbage&quot; as though they were speaking a different language.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, there&#39;s a filter now. There is also a /filter command that toggles it on<br/>
and off.<br/>
