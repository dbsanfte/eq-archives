<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399782317">I think you are right, writing off the top of my head here at work.  I could<br/>
not get the ring right away either, but I did enough quests/goblin/orc<br/>
slayings to get me to where Carillion would work.  I don&#39;t need Carillion to<br/>
get the jumjum quest, but with it I didn&#39;t need to turn in 4 stalks, 2<br/>
worked all three times I tried.  Now my faction is very high in Rivervale,<br/>
but Carillion definitely helps even when the conning message doesn&#39;t change.<br/>
I am amiable to the Shining Star guy in Qeynos but could not get the quest.<br/>
With Carillion I was still amiable but could get the quest and the reward,<br/>
although it is Cleric Paladin only, bummer.<br/>

&gt; When I completed the squad ring quest I noticed that Hendi Mrubble would<br/>

of<br/>
&gt; Carillion and the Marshal obliged my request for a new ring, another blast<br/>
&gt; and Hendi was equally cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting.  I had nowhere near enough faction to get a squad<br/>
ring (even using Carillion) so I bought one as an experiment.<br/>
Hendi normally would not recharge it, but using Carillion she<br/>
would.  Perhaps diety (Erollisi Marr here) has something to do<br/>
with it?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have also consistently gotten a reward<br/>
&gt; for 2 jumjum stalks from Uner, while most folks have to turn in 4 to get a<br/>
&gt; reward.  So far I have only found 2 quests I could not do, and those folks<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had to turn in 4 with Carillion.  Without Carillion he<br/>
won&#39;t even let me do the quest.  And I thought it was Rebo<br/>
Leafsway that was the guy you gave the jumjum stalks to<br/>
(Nillipus quest)?<br/>
