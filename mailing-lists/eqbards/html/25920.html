<b>Subject:</b> Grieg&#39;s End <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383011909">We really like Grieg&#39;s End but it&#39;s not for everyone. It&#39;s one big, huge<br/>
maze of a castle: hallways, courtyards, and rooms. A number of the mobs are<br/>
triggered, which makes them hard/impossible to split. The weird thing is the<br/>
mobs proc a spell on the players that turns you into a random mob. No stat<br/>
changes that we&#39;ve seen, you just look different. All the mobs look<br/>
different to every player too so you can&#39;t say &#39;I&#39;m on the zombie thing!&#39;,<br/>
&#39;cause each person in your group sees a different mob. If you&#39;ve got folks<br/>
that need a crash course on assisting a main tank, this is the zone! We&#39;ve<br/>
gotten some nifty odd drops in this zone, warrior helm with +25% taunt,<br/>
stone with +10% alchemy. We&#39;ve crawled thru it a couple times, found Grieg<br/>
himself but lacked the strength to kill him. We did kill the Servitor of<br/>
Luclin and a couple other nameds. This zone seems to be designed for a<br/>
crawl, not as much setup and camp. We&#39;ve done both though and I found the<br/>
exp there to move in 59, that means it was pretty good. Grieg&#39;s has 2<br/>
entrances: from Dawnshroud where most of my tracking sees green and some<br/>
blues at 59 and from Scarlet Desert where tracking shows all blue.<br/>
Maiden&#39;s Eye is cool, I like killing Xin&#39;s and especially the 4 armed purple<br/>
things. The exp there is really good. Umbrial is pretty neat, just went<br/>
there Tuesday night and got some decent armor drops. We&#39;ve had a lot of fun<br/>
killing vamps in Tenebrous Mtns, too.<br/>
I probably was afk in Shar Vahl, I spent time last week running multiple<br/>
toons and doing the Rallic pack quest multiple times. Great pack, easy<br/>

Speaking of quests, my wiz finished her 7th Coldain Shawl the day Luclin<br/>
came out! I spent A lot of time doing tradeskills with her last fall. I<br/>
can&#39;t wait to see what heinous things the 8th and 9th shawls will require.<br/>
