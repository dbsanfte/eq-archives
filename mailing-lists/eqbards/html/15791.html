<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408690663">Well went to Kedge for the first time. All in all it was disappointing. The <br/>
fact that I died 3 times and am currently separated from all my equipment <br/>
(Estrella is sittin on it) doesn&#39;t help any. I wouldn&#39;t suggest anyone trying <br/>
to find their way outa that place on your first visit. Its quite the maze. <br/>
Anyways a few interesting things. I was told that they use ice based spells <br/>
(well, true but they also use fire based and magic based suck as creeping <br/>
crud). So be prepared with the apropriate songs. Also found our water breathe <br/>
song stacks fine with enduring breath (but eb can&#39;t be cast on you if the <br/>
song icon is still on). This was the first night I&#39;ve used the cancel magic <br/>
song much (thorns and the like on the mermaids) and I noticed there is no <br/>
confirmation message (nothing like the spell message &quot;feels slightly <br/>
dispelled&quot;). Be nice to get that lil thing remedied, I like to know if its <br/>
beind resisted or what.<br/>
Anyways on to the main reason for this post. <br/>
This goes out to all yall MM&#39;rs. Tomorrow we&#39;re gonna try a large scale CR <br/>
but if it doesnt go well i&#39;d like to have some insurance. What I&#39;m looking <br/>
for is a necro with the summon corpse spell. I&#39;ll give 100 plat to whoever <br/>
finds the necro and 200 plat (plus 150 for the spell component) to the necro <br/>
himself. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks yall.</div>
