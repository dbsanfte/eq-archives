<b>Subject:</b> re: tanking bards, specialization? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169566700">I still find it hard to believe that a bard will ever make a better tank <br/>
than a warrior, rogue, or ranger. Perhaps with enough plate armor and buffs, <br/>
you might be equal to them but the best one? ehh, maybe (haven&#39;t seen it <br/>
yet) but I will try to keep an open mind ;]<br/>
<br/>
I will emphasize that a bard MUST be in a forceful (and I mean full party of <br/>
strong fighters) to simply play instruments. If the party has only 3 <br/>
members, a lot of casters, it is important to whip out the weapons and <br/>
fight. However if you have rogues backstabbing and warriors taunting , <br/>
rangers, monks . . . . basically a coordinated group somewhat evenly taking <br/>
damage, I stand strong in my position that a lute healing 60 points (10 <br/>
points per group member) of damage per pulse (and remember this will <br/>
increase in levels) is quite helpful and an efficient battle tactic (I have <br/>
TONS of personal examples).<br/>
<br/>
However the topic makes me ask, do you think EQ should allow bards to <br/>
specialize? For example Mr Tank Bard gets to have a better attack skill <br/>
where Ms Luteplaying Bard gets a better string skill.<br/>
<br/>
I for some reason have this strange image of a 250+pd tank who is constantly <br/>
getting knocked in the head, his fingers broken, with a lot of burly muscle <br/>
around his neck decked out in plate being a tad bit weaker in the musical <br/>
talent. Whereas the little fragile bard who does nothing but play songs and <br/>
try to avoid being hit, could just play masterpieces but fight wimpier?  To <br/>
the best of my knowledge it is &quot;fairly easy&quot; to max out your skills in <br/>
instruments and attack, no matter what your play style. I DON&#39;T want to TAKE <br/>
AWAY the BARD&#39;s SKILLS. I just think that specialization might allow one to <br/>
roleplay and create the type of bard they want to be, therefore making a <br/>
more rewarding game experience. Possibly the specialization could come out <br/>
in a year or so with the expansion pack when the bard is already 50th level, <br/>
something to look forward to?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, yea or nay comments welcome 8)</div>
