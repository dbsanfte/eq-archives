<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069774614">No the whole group.  The active lineup of my guild near my level is<br/>
Currently Four Druids, Two Paladins, A Ranger and myself.  Most of them just<br/>
got to the 49-50 Range (and Hit 51 pretty fast 49 and 50 are pretty easy to<br/>
level through) and want to group together.  Many of them didn&#39;t even spend<br/>
time in Karnor until recently and are looking to me (52) and the 53 Druid<br/>
(Guild leader) to take them to places like Sebelis and Chardok.<br/>
<br/>
	So my concern - can a group of typically Three Druids, 2 Paladins (or<br/>
Paladin/Ranger) and a Bard survive in places like<br/>
<br/>
	For practice - to be honest - I&#39;m more concerned about the rest of the<br/>
group than myself...  I&#39;ve done crowd control very successfully in Karnor<br/>
and even Chardok zone (albeit with different groups often containing a<br/>
Shaman) and relying on Charm...<br/>
<br/>
	On the positive - I&#39;m very close to 53 (slightly more than 3 blue bubs) so<br/>
I&#39;ve excited by my upcoming improved abilities.<br/>

I think a druid and a paladin are fine, although I assume you meant that as<br/>
the core and not as the whole<br/>
group.  I wouldn&#39;t try just three people in any of those places (except<br/>
maybe Sebilis zone-in or Karnor&#39;s<br/>
front).</div>
