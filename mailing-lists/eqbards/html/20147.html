<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710726641">Live frogs in upper guk cant see you if you use bard invis.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the room where the asassain spawns in lower guk, you traverse<br/>
upper guk (all live) then enter the &quot;dead side&quot; of lower guk.  But near the<br/>
zone to the dead side are some live frogs too.  When the server is busy,<br/>
they are usually killed by folks waiting for groups. People usually get<br/>
invis-to-undead here. Then there are undead frogs between the zone and the<br/>
bedroom.  You go past the bedroom and past some live vampire bats (hope that<br/>
they are camped) and undead frogs.  Then past the greater ice bone skellies<br/>
- who will agro if you get near them regardless of your invis or<br/>
invis-to-undead.  From there - go across the bridge to the tower and in and<br/>
to the left to the 2nd ladder you see and up the ladder to the<br/>
supplier/assasain room.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, its *possible* but most folks who do it have run the route before in<br/>
their other characters.<br/>
<br/>
If you go and beg this item now, what will you camp for when you are 35-45<br/>
and spending a lot of time in Lower Guk getting exp?<br/>

How about this in the leaching catagory. The mask of deception, my<br/>
understanding is that this rots a lot on most servers. I also see a lot of<br/>
lower level bards with one. When I have 19th level invis song is it possible<br/>
to get to the Assissin room (provided it&#39;s camped) and wait patiently and<br/>
politly for one to drop?</div>
