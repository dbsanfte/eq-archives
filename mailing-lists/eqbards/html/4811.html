<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484706512">What level are people who have trouble with casters?  I have not had any<br/>
trouble with casting bandits, necros in Befallen, orc casters in Kithicor<br/>
etc.  Even the ones that con yellow to me are possibly beatable.  On the<br/>
other hand I have a difficult time with the tank variety of monsters.  This<br/>
seems totally contrary to what other bards are experiencing so I wonder what<br/>
the big difference is?  I am currently level 15 and have dealt well with<br/>
casters since about level 10.<br/>

conning derv alone. But I&#39;m very lucky if I can survive a green conning <br/>
derv or madman that is a caster.. It&#39;s almost humorous how they never seem <br/>
to run out of mana too.<br/>
