&lt;&lt; They don&#39;t (and yes, I&#39;ve tested it).  From what I&#39;ve heard,<br/>
 they don&#39;t stack with caster speed debuffs as well, overriding<br/>
 them and causing the mob to go back to normal attack speed<br/>
 after your song expires (no, I haven&#39;t tested this). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I havent set out and actually done anything to test this, but i know from exp <br/>
that if a ranger/druid snares a mob and I chain it, it moves at regular speed <br/>
when the chain fades.<br/>
BTW if anyone didnt know this here ya go. If you get rooted chain yourself, <br/>
you&#39;ll be able to move at a walk, from there kick selo&#39;s in adn you will be <br/>
at selo&#39;s speed. Saved me a few times once i found this out.<br/>
