&gt;         Have found nodescription on the Level 14 song other than its name<br/>
&gt; &quot;Lysssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto&quot; . . . anyone know what it does and if it is<br/>
&gt; worth buying.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t purchased the song, but as I understand it, it will identify magic<br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, currently all magic items are already identified.<br/>
<br/>
The word on this song is... useless currently.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better than nothing though, which is what the level 14 song USED to be. :)<br/>
<br/>
If this thing does something else, I&#39;d love to hear it too.<br/>

&gt;         PS, can anyone point everyone to a GOOD list of the songs, with<br/>
&gt; descriptions in clear English (rather than a rote copy of the uselessness<br/>
&gt; that s the player guide). If not, I will make one and let everyone give input.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The bard guide on EQ Vault has some mistakes, but it has more than other lists<br/>
tend to have.  I wrote it though, so I&#39;m biased.  Already it needs updating.<br/>
