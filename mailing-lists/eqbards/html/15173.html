&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that they fixed the clouding song...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wat was the plan for the lvl 24 see invis song?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anybody remember the discussion?  Is this just another<br/>
&gt; useless song that they are going to expect us to deal with...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I keep hearing this and hopefully this will make you all realize that the<br/>
see invis song is still useful. Clouding only gives party see invis. In<br/>
other words, the only invis you can see are the members of your party that<br/>
you have invissed. You do not see all invisible creatures and players, only<br/>
those in your party.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see something that is invis outside of your party, see invis<br/>
is still the way to go.<br/>
