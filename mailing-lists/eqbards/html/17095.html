<div id="ygrps-yiv-762555575">One of the subtle challenges to EQ is balancing mana burn with hp burn.<br/>
<br/>
If your casters are making everyone wait while they (or one of them) meds,<br/>
my guess is that they are casting too much.  If your group can match melee<br/>
with mana, you will have less downtime.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; clarity.  Maybe after 32nd I would be able to reduce downtime again, but<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; already has not been the case for 10+ levels with another 9 to go.  Having<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; primary that doesn&#39;t exist for 20 levels isn&#39;t much of a primary.  My<br/>
groups<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t had a hp downtime for at least 2 months. </span></blockquote></div>
