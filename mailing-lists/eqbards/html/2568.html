<div id="ygrps-yiv-341826227">How do smoking and exploiting bugs corelate?  Oh wait, I remember.  I heard <br/>
this from one of the purple morons.  &quot;You&#39;re only hurting yourself.&quot;  Well, <br/>
ask yourself this, Prince: if this is only hurting me, why would you give a <br/>
shit?  I am not blaming a tobacco company(what a retarded analogy).  I am <br/>
exploiting a bug I *did not* create and harm is in the eye of the beholder.  <br/>
If I see no harm in it, and I am not forcing you out of your character into <br/>
my powergaming, so...what the F do you care?  I certainly don&#39;t see it as <br/>
harmful.  I will not die from it.  You will not die from it.  The problem <br/>
reverts itself straight back to the &quot;I don&#39;t like the way you play so I am <br/>
going to complain about you&quot; proselytizing you chartruese dorks do so well.  <br/>
Piss off, girly.</div>
