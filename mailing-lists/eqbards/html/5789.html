&gt; If you&#39;ve gotten this to work first hand, can you provide the rest of us<br/>
&gt; with some info - what spells it cancelled, how long it took, etc?  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; never &quot;field tested&quot; this one since I don&#39;t find myself fighting too many<br/>
&gt; necros, but when I tested it on a druid friends of mines dots, it did<br/>
&gt; absolutely nothing - dot did full damage, for full duration.  This was a few<br/>
&gt; weeks back - I&#39;d love to hear its working now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ok, due to many questions and remarks of people not getting<br/>
anything useful out of DEM, I guess it works only on some very<br/>
limited array of spells. Maybe I was just lucky in getting the few<br/>
that it works against on myself =)<br/>
<br/>
  1st hand info, though not really that spesific:<br/>
<br/>
Was in Najena, Drelzna room. First time for me, so after first spawn<br/>
and a bunch of DOTs on me I memmed DEM (disenchanting melody).<br/>
Dots and other stuff necromancers throw, whatever they are =)<br/>
2nd spawn and again had a few of dots etc. tickling me after the fight,<br/>
fired up DEM (probably had lute already up), if I remember right it removed<br/>
all the dots on the first pulse. So it does work.. however, someone could<br/>
test it more spesifically, with root, snare, all kinds of dots, drowsy line<br/>
from shamans etc. And then petition those that don&#39;t get removed.<br/>
I believe it should remove any malicious effect. Don&#39;t know if root/snare<br/>
etc. count yet as being offensive, since they don&#39;t do damage =P Anyways,<br/>
DEM does work. Poorly, but it works ;)<br/>
