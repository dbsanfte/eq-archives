<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576102408">I can&#39;t speak for how things are done on Mithaniel Marr, but when we&#39;re<br/>
planning on doing both dragons, we bring along both sets of gear so that we<br/>
don&#39;t need to stop at a bank in between.<br/>
Also, nobody puts on resist gear until we&#39;re fighting the dragon itself, so<br/>
a glance early on won&#39;t tell you what gear people brought with them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; equipment/spell/song wise to get both MR and CR/FR both over 200.  i dunno<br/>
&gt; what you see on these guys.  most of the items are jewelery, so you may<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; see that.  but every tank at our raids has froglok crowns and gnomish<br/>
&gt; environmental suits on.  you can see those easily.  a tank with<br/>
&gt; russett/indoclite mixed with a leather tunic and no helm stands out.  come<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I saw shaman in full grey planar gear, I saw a warrior in full indo<br/>
  minus helm (froglok crown on no doubt), a cleric in absolutely full <br/>
  purple armor, some casters had helms.  You&#39;re right, without inspecting<br/>
  each person (I did look at a few), I noticed no big surge of +CR/FR<br/>
  stuff.  In fact, despite what Miriana says... they did Nagafen, and<br/>
  immediately, do not pass go, do not collect 200$ went for Vox, I watched<br/>
  them the whole time.  Gate from Solb to WK, and straight to everfrost.<br/>
<br/>
  While some items produce CR/FR effects, not all items do.  So for<br/>
  a team so concerned with resistances as was said, why didn&#39;t they<br/>
  hit the bank and swap out gear for the next dragon?  Why didn&#39;t <br/>
  they pickup another bard?  They had 3 or 4 groups, and only 2 bards.<br/>
  I would have offered to go for the experience, and no loot.  The<br/>
  answer is that it&#39;s so routine for them, and they are so experienced<br/>
  at it, they don&#39;t need much resistance support.  Which was my whole<br/>
  point of this resistance thing, that if you have the right people,<br/>
  you can whoop a dragon without going overboard on the Elem/Guard<br/>
  songs.  You could then play VoV and Elemental, or something.<br/>
