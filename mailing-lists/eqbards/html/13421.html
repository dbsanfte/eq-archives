<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290480582"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; First three dragon breaths combined did less than a bubble to me.  Sometime<br/>
&gt; after that I had a bunch of my buffs dispelled.  2 more breaths, ended the<br/>
&gt; battle with a bubble and a half of life.  Started with just over 2000 HP.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Man I wish that was the case for me.... I want to believe.<br/>
<br/>
  I want 230 resistance to let me march right up to that b*tch and<br/>
  slap her around, but as it stands my results varied =(<br/>
<br/>
  It could have something to do with my unlucky dice.  Anytime I <br/>
  roll for something I always get like a 17 or 22.  Harmonic vs.<br/>
  DragonBreath seems to follow along those lines ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  /petition My random number generator is busted, I want a new one.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
