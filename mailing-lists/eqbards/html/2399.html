<b>Subject:</b> Instill doubt & Mana song strategy <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-571323599">I was wondering why this skill wasn&#39;t listed at the other trainers. I<br/>
finally asked a fellow bard about it and he told me you have to train it<br/>
with Caskin Marseheart upstairs in the Freeport&#39;s Bard Guild.<br/>
Well I went to him and it still wasnt there. Am I dense or something and<br/>
skip by it in the list? It should come after the Hand to Hand and Hide<br/>
skill in alphabetical order, correct? I also scrolled through the entire<br/>
list of skills and still didn&#39;t find it listed anywhere. I also left him<br/>
and came back several times and still didn&#39;t see it listed.<br/>
Ah well, maybe like I said, I&#39;m just dense and managed to scroll past it<br/>
5 times without ever seeing it. I suppose I&#39;ll check again.<br/>
<br/>
On another subject, I&#39;m wondering what the best strategy for using the<br/>
mana song is.<br/>
Should I even play it at all during combat? If I&#39;m in a group of casters<br/>
with only 1 tank, I usually do play the song. Or if someone says OOM<br/>
during combat I&#39;ll begin to sing it and tell them that the song is on<br/>
and they should stay near me. But I&#39;m wondering how effective this is.<br/>
Also while resting, everyone tells me to play the mana song, even if<br/>
everyone has like 2 bubbles of life, which is fine if there&#39;s a healer<br/>
or 2 in the group. But most of the time, because I&#39;m singing the mana<br/>
song instead of the healing song, everyone in the group is left with 4<br/>
bubbles of life.. instead of full life. The priests (clerics, druids,<br/>
shaman) never heal everyone up to full health. They always leave<br/>
everyone with 4 bubbles or 4 and a half bubbles of life remaining. And<br/>
before I got the mana song, I always kept the entire group at full life,<br/>
but I find that hard to do nowadays since &quot;FM&quot; now translates into<br/>
&quot;Incoming!&quot;. Usually this seems more efficient if your group can easily<br/>
handle the stuff you&#39;re fighting, but sometimes something goes wrong and<br/>
you&#39;re left wondering &quot;Maybe if we all had full life before battle?&quot;<br/>
Also, at first, I used to juggle healing song with mana song, but this<br/>
isnt very effective for mana regeneration since it seems that the mana<br/>
increases only when you see the text message &quot;Your mind clears&quot; instead<br/>
of there being an icon that lasts for 3 ticks after the song kicks in.<br/>
Any pointers on the strategy for using this song most effectively during<br/>
or after combat?<br/>
I&#39;d be most interested in how ye other bards handle this.</div>
