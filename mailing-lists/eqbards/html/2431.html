<b>Subject:</b> Skill caps? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-29719068">I recently noticed that despite getting the foraging skill at 12th level it<br/>
has never increased.  I was then informed that many of our skills have caps<br/>
on them of 40 or so.  What&#39;s the deal with this?  I really don&#39;t like the<br/>
idea of skill caps, especially on a simple self preservation skill like<br/>
foraging.  You already can&#39;t sell what you forage so why put a cap on it?<br/>
Does anyone know any more on this and what the possible reasoning behind<br/>
them could be?  What are bards just too stupid to learn these things really<br/>
well?  Its not bad enough we all get the useless skill of brass instruments<br/>
at 12th level, which cannot be used till 18th.  Now Wood Elves get no new<br/>
skill at 12th since forage is already maxed and hide is already at the<br/>
supposed cap as well.  Does that mean the xp penalty we take for being able<br/>
to start with those skills will go away once we actually have them?  I think<br/>
not.  I&#39;m usually not big on ranting, but this has me really steamed.  What<br/>
good is it to get a skill at 25th level that caps at a point where it will<br/>
only work on things 10+ levels below you?<br/>
 <br/>
J.M.  Any thoughts on this one?  Please tell me this will change at some<br/>
point. <br/>
