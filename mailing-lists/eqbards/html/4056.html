<b>Subject:</b> Blackened Iron Crown <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-601388951">I am on Xegony and recently got into the crown market. I bought my Blackened <br/>
Iron Crown for 120 pp in Runnyeye, had camped the King&#39;s room for Borxx <br/>
mainly and we got basically nothing but the odd blackened armor piece. Then <br/>
as we left another group took over and a bit later when I was getting ready <br/>
to zone out came an auction for the crown. The starting price was 120pp but <br/>
since it was late, no one bid against me. &lt;smile&gt;<br/>
Earlier the same item went about for 160 pp in Runnyeye, with someone <br/>
bidding against me. I had seen on go in West Commons for 170 pp. I do like <br/>
the crown and plan to keep it til something better comes along, like when I <br/>
am L50, lol. Besides for a wood elf female it looks So Much Better than a <br/>
plate helm! I am still in the crown market as my cleric friend needs one so <br/>
likely we will raid Runny again real soon.<br/>
On the weapons thread, I use banded thulian claw and a dragoon dirk, slowly <br/>
bringing up my piercing. I had used 2 barbed whips when I first got dual and <br/>
had quite a stam problem. I used Jig or my cleric friend would invigor me to <br/>
keep me swinging. New weapons lineup gives almost no stam problems.<br/>
Btw got a lizardscale cloak from a friend last Sunday! Very nice item!<br/>
