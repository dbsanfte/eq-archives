<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469615290"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kblair@...">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now that I have Celerity and<br/>
&gt; &gt; stack it with Chant of Battle<br/>
&gt; &gt; I never touch Bellows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just curious, does Celerity stack with Anthem de Arms? If so, I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;interested<br/>
&gt;in why one would choose Chant of Battle over Anthem. My current lineup at<br/>
&gt;level 16 (DING! - I *love* the jig! It&#39;s so much more entertaining if while<br/>
&gt;watching it, you sing to yourself - &quot;Do a little dance, Make a little love,<br/>
&gt;Get down tonight! Get down tonight!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Celerity does not stack with Anthem - I took Shada&#39;s advice and twisted <br/>
Celerity w/Chant and it works great. The tanks love it too, STR, DEX, and a <br/>
NICE AGI bonus, as well as a seemingly better speedup than with Anthem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Then I usually use two remaining slots to rotate as needed things like<br/>
&gt;Locating, Aquatic Ayre and Cindra&#39;s Charismatic Carillion (even though I<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t noticed it doing much good).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t underestimate the Carillon! I play a half elf and went to Kaladim to <br/>
buy steel armor for a high elf friend of mine (I found that the gnomes <br/>
quoted same prices in Ak&#39;anon earlier). The dwaven smith quoted me at around <br/>
960 plat or so for a small steel breastplate. After buffing my Charisma with <br/>
all my CHA items i managed to shave about 5- to 75 plat off that. Then i <br/>
conned him and found he was apprehensive so I used Carrillon on him to make <br/>
him Amiable. I was astounded to see the price for a small steel breastplate <br/>
drop to 805 plat! I think Enchanters got it better for this type of thing, <br/>
but when ya can&#39;t find one.. =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Songs that I&#39;ve noticed don&#39;t seem to do much are the Rhythm songs and the<br/>
&gt;Lucid Lullaby (Rats outside of Freeport were resisting it to me last night<br/>
&gt;at level 16).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lullaby is nowhere near as good as it was in beta. Of course an enchanter is <br/>
THE way to go for crowd control - but when none is available, I will use <br/>
lullaby if there is too many creatures in a fight. Most of the time (for me) <br/>
it works well enough that we can concentrate on one mob at a time and our <br/>
healer can keep me alive =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I didnt even bother to purchase the Cataloging song. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;looking forward to 17 for the dual weild and sneak  skills but I &gt;don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;know whether to get the song since it&#39;s another in the line of Rhythms. Is <br/>
&gt;it me<br/>
&gt;doing something wrong, or are these songs either very weak or completely<br/>
&gt;useless?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t really comment on these last songs you mentioned. The few times I have <br/>
used resistance songs was when there was another bard in my group (very <br/>
rare), and she sat back with her drums for full effect. We were killing the <br/>
froglok scryer and noone ever got charmed, so we were pretty happy with it <br/>
