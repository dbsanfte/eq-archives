Not sure if this has been posted, hope not..<br/>
On the test server bards now have meditate, to memorize spells faster.  This is from a person I group with, so can&#39;t give you first hand knowledge.  Also, I haven&#39;t played my bard in quite awhile so can&#39;t remember how lullaby reported back to the player, but the bard I was with say they are getting messages when lullaby is resisted...  again it seems to me that that is not a new thing, but posting it just in case.<br/>

p.s. about 80 days played, if not more.. and not a 50 to my credit...  Do I like to goof off? =p<br/>
