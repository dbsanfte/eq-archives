&gt;	I can possibly see how they could miss this. Who would think to sell these<br/>
&gt;things back to a vendor when they are mainly to be used to get quest items.<br/>
&gt;Especially on the test server where there are probably not enough people to<br/>
&gt;find this out (or the people who found this out waited till the patch came<br/>
&gt;down to make mega cash like the pie tin sketch incident). They also almost<br/>
&gt;slipped up on the Shin Gauntlets. Trying to sell them to a vendor will get<br/>
&gt;you a price of 432 plat but the vendors won&#39;t buy them...<br/>
&gt;	Incidentally, anyone know where Greater Dark Bone Skeletons spawn? I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;*really* like a pair of the bracers and I&#39;ve never heard of these things<br/>
&gt;before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Good Journey,<br/>
