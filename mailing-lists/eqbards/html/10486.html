<b>Subject:</b> Singing with higher levels... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-507252470">Now that the high-level members of my guild have decided to acknowledge <br/>
my existence (at level 33 - now 34 - I could get exp with the 50s), I am <br/>
wondering what, exactly, I should be singing when I am in places where <br/>
the MOBs are MUCH higher level than I am?  The offensive and enemy debuff <br/>
songs get resisted so often that it seems like a waste of my efforts.<br/>
<br/>
I have some strategies for singing against casters that seem to do OK, <br/>
but what do I sing against high-level melee stuff?  I&#39;ve been using <br/>
Anthem, Psalm of Warmth and either healing or clarity, but the Psalm is <br/>
partially useless (who needs the cold protection against melee MOBs, and <br/>
it&#39;s not worth much against single MOBs) and the heal and clarity are <br/>
really not that useful in combat.  Any thoughts?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s worth singing stuff even if the resist rate is <br/>
high?  After all, I shouldn&#39;t be expected to contribute THAT much if I&#39;m <br/>
10 levels lower than everyone else?!?<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I was using Lullaby a lot when there were a LOT of MOBs.  Even if <br/>
they resist 50%, you&#39;re still taking out half of their attacks.  The only <br/>
nuisance is that, even with players in their 40s, I found myself <br/>
repeatedly typing:  /g One at a time;  /g Get the [wizard];  /g Assist <br/>
[Joe].  Makes it tough to weave songs, since only one of these can be <br/>
hot-keyed.  ;P<br/>
