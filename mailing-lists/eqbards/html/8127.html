<div id="ygrps-yiv-217672494">I totally agree with John Kim on optimizing game play being a lot of the<br/>
kick for me.   I also play a troll shaman in attention to my bard and I can<br/>
tell you that with each new rank there opens up literally 100&#39;s of new<br/>
permutations - finding those 2 or 3 that WORK is awesome.  Its not an<br/>
exaggeration to state I spend hours testing new spells for myself before I<br/>
decide if they show potential or not (like you&#39;d be making a mistake if you<br/>
read the shaman&#39;s guilds telling you that frenzy is worthless).  Bards are<br/>
even more of a challenge since every level we introduce a new variable.  As<br/>
your group matures and the mobs change you&#39;ll find that having 1, 2 even 3<br/>
backup contingencies not to be unrealistic - we&#39;ve all had bad pulls that<br/>
some how we fight through and come up smelling like a rose either by<br/>
accident or by inventive tactics - I prefer the tactics part but in practice<br/>
serendipity has saved my bacon a time or two... he he.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully with bard hate being what it is, we have PLENTY of chances for<br/>
experimentation. :)</div>
