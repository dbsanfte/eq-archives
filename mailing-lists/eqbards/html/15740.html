<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089631701">I got lucky... a guild member gave me mine Yk last week and on Friday the<br/>
Kisch Der Pavz fell for me in Paw :-).  Now I&#39;m happily wield the Yk in the<br/>
primary and the Kisch in the offhand.  Big difference from my old claws and<br/>
silvery war axe.  Think the Yk camp is bad?  The Tesch Val Dval&#39;Nmak that<br/>
drops the Kisch is a 2 hour spawn and his rare is the sword and he really<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a common although he occasionally drops a crummy gold ring.<br/>
I&#39;ve been killing him twice to three times a night for almost 2 weeks.  We<br/>
got the comando raid down to a science to get in there, kill him and get<br/>
back out.  Great to have guild members that will drop what they are doing to<br/>
do a comando raid :-).   Last monday he dropped a FS long sword instead of<br/>
the Kisch.  Imagine my disappointment at that!<br/>

&gt; How in the world to people obtain Ykeshas these days?  I heard they used<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; drop a lot more often but this is absurd.  Yesterday I logged on at 11am<br/>
CST<br/>
&gt; in lguk and joined a Savant group, sent a tell to the list holder of the<br/>
&gt; Lord group and started killing frogs.  I was finally called for my turn in<br/>
&gt; the Lord group at 6pm CST, 7 hours later.  Shortly after I arrived one of<br/>
&gt; the people ahead of me on the list fell asleep after an 18 hour camp and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; guy after him got a Yak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The group changed a couple times in the next hour so by 8pm I was on the<br/>
top<br/>
&gt; of the list for a Yak, 2 hours after joining the group.  We then camped<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; room and I finally gave up with no Yak (5 SSB&#39;s) at 2:30am, 7 and a half<br/>
&gt; hours and no Yak.  By the time I left I was the only original group member<br/>
&gt; left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Meanwhile people continue to berate me for wielding a staff of writhing at<br/>
&gt; 42nd level.  What&#39;s a bard to do, has it always been this tough of a camp?<br/>
&gt; This is totally absurd.<br/>
