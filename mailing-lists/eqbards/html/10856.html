&gt;   I sit and stare at my everquest monitor at work, thinking how<br/>
&gt;   in the hell are 15,000 people playing this game at 11am in the<br/>
&gt;   morning, souldnt they be asleep, at school, or at work???  We<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t have that many people who play from Europe.<br/>

in a group in Highkeep once, thinking to myself that their spelling and <br/>
grammar was somewhat lacking, so I asked where they were from.  Tokyo, <br/>
Hong Kong, Bern, Paris and Geneva.  Pretty cool.  Then there was the <br/>
group that insisted on &quot;talking&quot; French - they were all from Quebec.  <br/>
hehe<br/>
