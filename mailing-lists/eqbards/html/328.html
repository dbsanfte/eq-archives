&gt;Damn.  Yall are like little children.  I love coming home, checking my<br/>
&gt;e-mail, and seeing I have 50 new mails, all gripes back and forth about<br/>
&gt;something that doesn&#39;t concern most of the people on the list.  If you<br/>
&gt;have a gripe, go private with it, and at least respect the people on<br/>
&gt;the list that are on the list to enrich their bardic experience, not to<br/>
&gt;be the jury in a really stupid debate.  As for the Soarbairds, they&#39;re<br/>
&gt;going to do what they&#39;re going to do, no matter what anyone else says,<br/>
&gt;so there ain&#39;t no use gripin about it to everyone.  If people are going<br/>
&gt;to join, they&#39;re going to, no matter what you say.  I hate to say it,<br/>
&gt;but all of you guys griping and badmouthing, aren&#39;t doing a DAMN thing<br/>
&gt;except wasting a lot of people&#39;s time and filling their boxes with junk<br/>
&gt;mail.  Thanks.<br/>
