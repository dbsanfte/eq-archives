<div id="ygrps-yiv-98272740">I agree totally. If running away while flinging axes,daggers or stars is<br/>
okay then songs/spells should be no different.<br/>
<br/>
And the most-used method of avoiding certain death by monsters (Zoning)<br/>
sounds like the biggest exploit to me (by their standards) yet is allowed.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been reading the messages about kiting but I have never done it. As of<br/>
&gt;yet, I don&#39;t really have strong enough songs to perform it effectively.<br/>
&gt;My question is: why is it an exploit? Certain songs/spells have a ranged or<br/>
&gt;radius effect. What if I&#39;m out singing (don&#39;t have a lute or mandolin yet)<br/>
&gt;the Chords of Discord (hurts my throat) and killing beasties. While looting<br/>
&gt;a corpse I&#39;m set upon by a beastie that I feel is too tough for me. I begin<br/>
&gt;to run from it. Getting lost, I run around in circles reading messages that<br/>
&gt;the beastie winces and I occasionally take damage. Let&#39;s say that I<br/>
&gt;accidentally kill the beastie before it kills me.<br/>
&gt;Have I exploited a bug or not? I was running away the entire time. Is it my<br/>
&gt;fault that the beastie is so enraged it will follow me to the ends of<br/>
&gt;Norrath (or the nearest zone wall)? If this is exploiting a bug, what is<br/>
&gt;the bug? Is the bug the fact that I have a song that can damage beasties at<br/>
&gt;range or that I can run as fast or faster than some or that beasties chase<br/>
&gt;you?<br/>
&gt;What if I had a missle weapon and was singing Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Running<br/>
&gt;backwards, I am faster than some beasties. By throwing daggers or axes at<br/>
&gt;them I stay out of range and they take damage. Taking damage they will<br/>
&gt;continue to follow me in which case, I will continue to lob whatever I can<br/>
&gt;at them. Is this exploiting a bug? It seems like the same situation, but is<br/>
&gt;now OK.<br/>
&gt;I am confused and a little scared. Who decides where the fine line between<br/>
&gt;clever and exploitation is? I fear to try new things only to discover that<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve &#39;cheated&#39; and will now be banned.<br/>
