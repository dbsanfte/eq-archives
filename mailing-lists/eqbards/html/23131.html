<div id="ygrps-yiv-518680139">Dang, sorry I missed you.  Atonal didn&#39;t get logged on this weekend, only<br/>
because my guild grouping partners never showed, at least when I was on.<br/>
That and my druid was almost 19, and I really was psyched about being able<br/>
to self teleport...hehe...and trying to do the bone talisman quest.  Just<br/>
way into the druid.  :)  Speaking of bone talisman...about 2 hours killing<br/>
that dumb tiger, and nothing but ruined cat pelts...  :/  If anyone here on<br/>
Xegony has a tiger hide laying around, I&#39;ll buy it...hehe.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Lots-o-questions...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#1) The new changes with Selos has added some new excitement to the <br/>
game - I think I was more scared running through Burning Woods <br/>
yesterday than I have been since I first entered the zone. In the <br/>
past, I always knew I could outrun anything I might aggro... yesterday, <br/>
I was not so sure. *Grins*<br/>
<br/>
#2) I have been thinking about trying to get a SS bracer, but really <br/>
do not want to put the time in the camp. EQ Prices has them listed in <br/>
the 2K-2.5K range, but a couple of my friends kinda laughed and said <br/>
I would be looking in the 10K-15K range... what is the price of the <br/>
bracer, and how good are they? (BTW, this is on Xegony.)<br/>
<br/>
#3) Speaking of equipment, I think it is time I look at replacing my <br/>
Lizardscale cloak. (I am level 52) I have been getting a LOT of grief <br/>
from my guildmates over this (much as I did when they found out I was <br/>
still wearing a collar of undead protection.) Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
#4) I have been having some trouble evaluating the worth of the level <br/>
52 song. Have anyone found it to good/bad?<br/>

*) Tawney: Still in 59? I am rooting for ya!<br/>
*) Dark: Sorry I could not chat more in HS last night... I hope your <br/>
raid went well.<br/>
*) Atonal: I looked for you this weekend, but did not see you online. <br/>
Maybe I was looking at the wrong time?<br/>
*) Slyde: Better hurry out of 52, or I might just beat ya to 53. <br/>
