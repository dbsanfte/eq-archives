&gt; thank you!  no offense of course, i always correct everyone.  actually i<br/>
&gt; have heard of people hunting pets in lake rathe and oasis, though i don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know of any trick or way to get shaman to spawn.<br/>

and see if they are making pets.  If you really want a bunch of mid-20&#39;s to<br/>
love you, go and set up all the spawns at one of the DW Gob areas to be<br/>
shamans.  The number of pets produced is staggering and can actually supply<br/>
good XP from level 23 to level 29 or so.<br/>
