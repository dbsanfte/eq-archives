in, the decision would&#39;ve gone:  Drum.  Bards use drums.  One<br/>
bard in the party.  Bard gets drum.<br/>

Lately, I&#39;ve been joining in on lottos if someone who can&#39;t<br/>
use an item wants in on it (which fortunately is rare).  If I<br/>
win, I just give it to the person who can use it.<br/>
