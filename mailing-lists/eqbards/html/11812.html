<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898075919"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Off course I post about what makes me happy - I see you have no problems<br/>
&gt; developing your own list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  As we all could I&#39;m sure.  We all like different aspects of the <br/>
  game.  The fact that Verant can capture each of us in a different<br/>
  way is a feat in itself.<br/>

&gt; to take away anything from your experience - perhaps broaden your horizons<br/>
&gt; just a bit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I have taken the time to more fully develop my character, rather than<br/>
  fighting nonstop monsters or beating up ogre guards.  However, in the<br/>
  right group getting major exp can be extremely fun with personality<br/>
  conflicts, jokes, and bloopers.<br/>
<br/>
  Last I can recall, these are my stats (of well roundedness)<br/>
  No gloating, just fyi junk...<br/>
<br/>
  smithing, 90.<br/>
  fletching, 103.<br/>
  swimming, 180 something?<br/>
  baking, 82.<br/>
  brewing, 146.  bleeding brains still increase this.<br/>
  pottery, 135?  prepatch, however lined vials still increase it.<br/>
  beg, 21? hehe...<br/>
  tailoring, 23!  woohoo.<br/>
  fishing, 125.<br/>
<br/>
  Since bards in general have low wis/int, lemme tell ya it&#39;s damn hard<br/>
  to raise some of these.  But I think I&#39;ve spent many a day fishing<br/>
  with my L20 buds.  Or baking fish fillets for my monk friends.  Making<br/>
  bleeding brains for people, and watching people&#39;s reaction when we<br/>
  all are drinking them.  I have a great time doing all that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess in my apparently inept way - I&#39;m advising you to stop and smell the<br/>
&gt; flowers. Value those around you a bit more - appreciate the little things<br/>
&gt; that can make for a fuller experience.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Right now, to attain a truly full experience from EQ I want to do<br/>
  dragon and plane raids.  To be my best, I would like to be L50 to<br/>
  do it.  Thus my push for L50.  And the lack of high level bards,<br/>
  too.<br/>
<br/>
  Since us bards need groups to survive (usually), when I cannot find<br/>
  a good group, I never let it ruin my day.  I instantly pick up my<br/>
  fishing pole or start making more beer.  In that way your point<br/>
  is clear, no mobs doesnt ruin my fun all the time.<br/>
<br/>
  Btw, thanks for not capitalizing anything!  Very much appreciated.<br/>
