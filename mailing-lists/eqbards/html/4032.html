<div id="ygrps-yiv-215745992">Last night I got to party with 2 other bards for the first time in a party.  <br/>
I have to admit, it was such a blast. we were 25,26,and 27 respectively.  <br/>
That with a 29 lvled warrior and and a 31druid, we were finishing of <br/>
mistmoore mobs in about 10seconds each. the 9 songs being stacked were psalm <br/>
of warmth, hymn, chords, ddd, binding, bellow, chain, anthem, fear/sleep <br/>
when necessary.  i had the lovely honor of singing ddd, chords, and heal.  <br/>
that with my obsidian shard and enammelled mace was shelling out huge <br/>
damage.  im curious to find out what weapons everyone (20+) enjoys using.  <br/>
Im a parttime business man dabbling in armour sales, but im a weapons <br/>
collector for fun. my personal stash includes demon claw, staff of writhing, <br/>
black enammelled mace, dragoon dirk, obsidian shard, lj crook.  had to give <br/>
up my tommys awhile back.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Psalm of Warmth is a very very very useful song if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;soloing.  When soloing, nearly anything that gives you<br/>
&gt;experience is going to hit you lots and lots of times.  With<br/>
&gt;the Psalm of Warmth&#39;s fire shield, your opponent takes damage<br/>
&gt;every time he hits you.  At L27 it was &quot;only&quot; 4 points per<br/>
&gt;hit, but considering you&#39;re probably going to be hit 20-40<br/>
&gt;times in a solo fight, that&#39;s 80-160 points of free damage.<br/>
&gt;I was having trouble soloing defenders in Cazic until I<br/>
&gt;thought of this.  I started weaving the Psalm and suddenly the<br/>
&gt;fights I&#39;d been losing handily before, I started winning.<br/>
&gt;Weave it with Hymn and you can make the battle last even<br/>
&gt;longer causing your opponent to take even more damage.  If you<br/>
&gt;can manage four songs, I&#39;d do Anthem, Psalm, Chain, Hymn.  If<br/>
&gt;you can only do three, I&#39;d drop Chain - you will be taking<br/>
&gt;more hits, but your opponent will be taking damage for each of<br/>
&gt;those hits, so it&#39;s not as great a loss as you&#39;d first think.<br/>
&gt;Swap Chain for Psalm when your opponent starts to flee.<br/>
