<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054311286">Well, brewing does net some cash, actually.  If you knuckle down and ignore<br/>
your arm falling asleep, 40pp (some claim 60pp) for an hour&#39;s time is not<br/>
too bad, really.  Was with brewing I brought my bank account from a few<br/>
silver to afford a combine.  I have a druid friend who was going to retire<br/>
at level 19 just because he couldn&#39;t afford his spells!  But now he brews.<br/>
And brews.  And brews.  (I almost feel guilty for explaining the trade to<br/>
him.)<br/>
<br/>
Apparently there is some bard on your very server, Fenin Ro, around level 8<br/>
or 9, selling Bog Juice.  I have no idea where to even start with respect to<br/>
experimenting with recipies for it.  The EQBrewers list is fairly worthless<br/>
in this respect, just folks arguing and ranting--no real exchange of<br/>
information for Bog Juice.  The recipe will likely be shared there last,<br/>
too, when the secret&#39;s out.  Anyone know where this flaming sword Paladin<br/>
quest even starts so I can look into it and experiment for this new<br/>
libation?<br/>
<br/>
As for bards and drinking, ah just like the old Bard&#39;s Tale.  Mages had<br/>
mana, bards had their booze.  I kind of play it that way too, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
For level 19, been to Unrest?  Or Permafrost?<br/>
