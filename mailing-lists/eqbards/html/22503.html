<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976769917">I remember this thread but can&#39;t remember who actually posted.  Was it Absor<br/>
who posted the reply?  Or was it JM Capozzi (who we all thought was a Verant<br/>
insider for a long time)?   <br/>

Make of this what you will. Personally, I think that the first poster turned<br/>
out to be a bit more correct in his predictions than the guy who answered<br/>
him.  And the scary thing is that the guy who answered him has since shed<br/>
his &quot;guise of the deceiver&quot; and is now a VI employee.  I really like the<br/>
part about bards being able to heal more than clerics &lt;snicker&gt;. It just<br/>
does not work that way in how this game gets played. To be fair - he may not<br/>
have had much experience beyond level 45 at that point and with only &quot;old<br/>
world&quot; zones - certainly does not seem to consider the current use of a main<br/>
tank and complete heal that most everyone uses in combat. <br/>
