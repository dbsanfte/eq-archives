<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954759004">Archers aren&#39;t really all that over-powered.  I play a &quot;Ranger&quot; that I<br/>
created.  He&#39;s specialized in archery & axe.  I find myself using the axe<br/>
FAR more often in dungeons and the bow more often on the surface.  Archers<br/>
are supposed to be powerful in open areas where they can peg you from 300<br/>
yards.  Underground the tanks rule.<br/>

<br/>
I played AC for 4 mos.  In that time, I got a Sho melee sword fighter with <br/>
creature and item 4 to level 30.<br/>
<br/>
Things I liked about AC:<br/>
<br/>
-Totally customizable characters.<br/>
<br/>
-The GM staff and Turbine are not paranoid.<br/>
<br/>
-Camping is almost not an issue.<br/>
<br/>
-You can get experience off of anything you kill, albeit less the higher you <br/>
go if the critter is low level.<br/>
<br/>
-The death penalty doesnt hurt as much as EQ.<br/>
<br/>
-The ability to solo.<br/>
<br/>
Things I didn&#39;t like about AC:<br/>
<br/>
-The interface<br/>
<br/>
-The chat system<br/>
<br/>
-The posing for combat (got my mage killed plenty).<br/>
<br/>
-The graphics<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the game is becoming more crowded.  The higher in level you go, <br/>
the more difficult it becomes to find places to hunt that will give you <br/>
decent experience. (sound familiar?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mages and archers are very powerful.  I&#39;ve had an archer 5 levels below me <br/>
out kill me in dungeons using the quarrel bug, which has been in existence <br/>
since beta.  They can&#39;t take the hits that a melee fighter can, so they will <br/>
stand back and let you tank while they suck up the experience.  Since <br/>
everyone who touches a monster gets experience from it, there is no &quot;kill <br/>
stealing&quot; per se.  Your only recourse is to leave him to it.<br/>
<br/>
When I decided to leave AC and return to EQ, my patriarch, our monarch <br/>
(level 40 archer), and some other vassels in the allegiance all came with <br/>
me.  So far, they like it better than AC.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t to say I totally hate AC, or that I don&#39;t see the problems EQ <br/>
has, just, for me, EQ has more depth to it.<br/>
<br/>
I too, would like to see a nice hybrid of the best of the MORPG&#39;s I&#39;ve <br/>
played. Done right, it could be an awesome game.<br/>
