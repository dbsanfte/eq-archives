Keep your drum and lute with you, even though in many cases you will not<br/>
switch them out, but a lot of times you will find it necessary.  bank<br/>
the rest.  and Grats =)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Finally!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finally done with my epic! I knew it would be soon as the Maestro<br/>
finally dropped a 7 string when we were in Hate last Saturday. That<br/>
meant of<br/>
course I would soon finish the epic and not need the lute. I do have a<br/>
question that I have not seen a clear answer on: is the epic as powerful<br/>
as<br/>
all our best instruments or stronger in string, lesser in percussion?<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
just trying to figure out what instruments I don&#39;t need to carry around<br/>
anymore.</div>
