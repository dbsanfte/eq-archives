<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707623944">there is definitely a fine line between helping out and overdoing it.  I<br/>
gave my cleric friend a fine steel morning star and a bronze breastplate to<br/>
start his career.  Those two items made leveling to 6th so much easier for<br/>
him.  He outfitted himself most of the rest of the way though if I saw<br/>
something cheap I bought it and sold it to him for cost.  Yes giving someone<br/>
equipment they will be using for 10+ levels is probably going to dull their<br/>
experience.  Getting new stuff is way to cool to take away from someone!<br/>

But are you really making their life easier by twinking them?  Are you<br/>
really enhancing the playing experience?  I know a Druid, who was givin the<br/>
following equipment before they reached 2nd level: Full Leather Armor, many<br/>
snakeskin pieces including tunic, Bloodforge hammer, 2 cutthroat rings, at<br/>
least 50 plat.  Now whats next for her?  When she thinks about the &quot;next<br/>
cool item&quot; she wants to get her hands on.  She is thinking about items that<br/>
are WAY over her head.  She is now 13th level, and she still hasent out<br/>
grown any of her equipment.  And now after 13 levels she is realizing that<br/>
it is very difficult to get stuff.  13 levels and she haddent gained the<br/>
respect for items that you get over time.  It is sad.  She is bored, and<br/>
feeling useless.  Actually I have talked her into creating a bard :) and she<br/>
is building up from scratch with no twinks.<br/>
<br/>
Ok Im not talking about giving a tarnished weapon to a 1st level char.  No<br/>
Im talking about giving someone somthing that they will be stuck with for a<br/>
very very long time.  Change is good.  And on top of this.  My poor Druid<br/>
friend, has been using a 2 handed blunt bloodforge for 13 levels, never<br/>
switching weapons.  Now she is stuck, and worried about switching to a<br/>
weapon she has never used.  Wow.  <br/>
<br/>
I dont get it.  Perhaps im a little jaded because I have been looking for a<br/>
Bronze Breastplate for the last 2 weeks with no luck.. But I dont think its<br/>
all that.<br/>

&gt; not have friends who offer.  But I always turn it down.  If you twink a<br/>
&gt; character, you are giving them something, but you are also taking<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; even more valuable away from them.  The wonderfull experience of leveling<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; their own.  And knowing that thay can look at their inventory and remember<br/>
&gt; all of the wonderfull adventures spent on getting the wonderfull items.<br/>
<br/>
	But getting items is not as glorious and fun as you make it out to<br/>
be, at least, not very often.  The message boards are filled with rants of<br/>
&quot;I went to so and so dungeon, and right before I killed this monster, some<br/>
level 40 invisible magician ran by us and stole my kill&quot;.  Do you really<br/>
want your second character, or your friends, to go through the same system<br/>
of camping hours on end and dealing with kill stealers that you did?<br/>
	It&#39;s something ingrained in human nature to try and make the lives<br/>
of our family and friends easier, to save them the hardships that we had<br/>
to go through.  To me, the &quot;fun&quot; in everquest is the interaction between<br/>
you and your friends, going in a group to kill monsters to learn new<br/>
skills and new spells.  Going through a dungeon to get items is nice and<br/>
all, but when the items in question are ones in which you have to deal<br/>
with people who&#39;s sole purpose seem to deprive other people of their fun,<br/>
by farming the items for ebay, or kill stealing them items for themselves,<br/>
I for one wouldn&#39;t want to go through that experience any more than I have<br/>
to, nor would I want to put anyone else through it.<br/>
