&gt;Question: Were you able to complete the quest for the hero bracer yourself<br/>
&gt;as a bard? There has been some uncertainty as to whether this is possible <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Answer: I would hold off and see what the final stats for the Lambent armor<br/>
&gt;is when it hits the live servers because what you see on the test server <br/>
&gt;may<br/>
&gt;change slightly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes I can complete the quest. Matter of fact, I&#39;m the one who has been <br/>
called on to do the quest by most of my friends because bards can bypass <br/>
faction requirements and because of item No Drop restrictions. I won&#39;t give <br/>
details of the quest here, but anyone who does some digging (like 1, MAYBE 2 <br/>
pages into your favorite EQ spoiler site) can find out how to do it. The <br/>
catch is you HAVE to be a medium race with good faction both to complete the <br/>
quest (if you can call it that), and to wear the resultant item. I&#39;ve seen <br/>
small races try it and all quest related items are vaporized every time, <br/>
whether or not they have the right faction.<br/>
<br/>
Lambent Armor: Aye, of course I&#39;m basing my decision on the currently known <br/>
stats of the armor, and I&#39;ll definitely reevaluate this if the stats change <br/>
by Wednesday. Either way, I&#39;ll most likely do the quests just for something <br/>
to do. =) Finally a REAL quest that nets us something for US that is of <br/>
worth. None of this fed-ex crap for some gold coins, or running all over <br/>
just to get an unneeded copy of our level 1 song.<br/>
