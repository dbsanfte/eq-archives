&gt;Dual wielding is completely independant.<br/>

&gt;The delay of your primary hand has nothing to do with the delay of your off<br/>
&gt;hand. That being said, if you want to dual wield a lot, put a very fast<br/>
&gt;weapon into your off hand.<br/>

ago) you did a check for Dual Weild at the end of every primary attack. A<br/>
faster weapon in your primary hand meant more checks, likely meaning more<br/>
dual weilding. No?<br/>
