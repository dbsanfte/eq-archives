&gt;Dual wielding is completely independant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The delay of your primary hand has nothing to do with the delay of your off<br/>
&gt;hand. That being said, if you want to dual wield a lot, put a very fast<br/>
&gt;weapon into your off hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whoops, when last I heard the word on how these things worked (some time<br/>
ago) you did a check for Dual Weild at the end of every primary attack. A<br/>
faster weapon in your primary hand meant more checks, likely meaning more<br/>
dual weilding. No?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;At lower levels, with no minimum damage, the conventional theory is to put<br/>
&gt;the faster weapon in the off hand so that you will dual weild more.<br/>
