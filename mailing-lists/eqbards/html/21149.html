<div id="ygrps-yiv-561737615">In any case on this planes farming debate, I&#39;d like to thank all who posted<br/>
that info.  My guild is trying to get some members into planes/dragon runs<br/>
now, so when we have enough guild members to do a run (we estimate in about<br/>
6 weeks we will be able to get 18 people together for a planes run, so we<br/>
will need to fill spots with outside help), we will have some experienced<br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
We will be using some of this info soon (though I&#39;m hoping for Hate raids!)</div>
