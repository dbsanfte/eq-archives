<div id="ygrps-yiv-412823480">Perhaps a long term solution for EQ is to integrate the best aspects UO<br/>
somewhere in the future.   Perhaps a new continent where every zone is PVP.<br/>
Would be nice to see a player run justice system, guildwars, etc.  Perhaps a<br/>
completely revamped trade system as well.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Being a longtime UO player - and looking for a &#39;virtual world&#39; - this has<br/>
&gt; ALWAYS been my #1 complaint about EQ - also the clue that OSI is most<br/>
&gt; afraid Verant will catch onto.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love both - but UO is a &#39;world&#39; - EQ is a &#39;game&#39; in it&#39;s current state.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People live in worlds - practically indefinately. People win games and<br/>
&gt; move<br/>
&gt; onto something else.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;This is actually a criticism Raph Koster (Designer Dragon) had<br/>
&gt; &gt;with EQ.  As currently implemented, EQ is an advancement-based<br/>
&gt; &gt;game.  After you hit the top level, there is little to do<br/>
&gt; &gt;besides the same thing over and over to get more stuff.  UO<br/>
&gt; &gt;(even with its faults) gets around the problem by being more<br/>
&gt; &gt;of a social game - there are lots of new things you can do<br/>
&gt; &gt;once you max out all your skills.<br/>
