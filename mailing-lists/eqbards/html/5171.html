&gt;&gt;   I totally agree. There is NO secret nerfing going on. Do you question when<br/>
&gt;&gt; you hit for max damage in melee 5 times in a row? Then why the big fuss over<br/>
&gt;&gt; some missed notes? It happens, I think they have a name for it, bad luck?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Umm. Take a look at the people who are mentioning this the most. Mostly<br/>
&gt;40+ level players. Don&#39;t you think someone who had played the game long<br/>
&gt;enough to get to that level might just have _some_ feel for how often<br/>
&gt;you get a missed note by now? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not really. Your own mind can start noticing things it never noticed before<br/>
completly unintentionally. An example of this is whenever i learn a new<br/>
word... it pops up all over the place. Before i just glanced over it and<br/>
ignored it, but now it stands out like a signil fire. I would guess the<br/>
same thing is hapenning here... and that nothing has changed, except maybe<br/>
a *lessening* of missed notes as verant documented on the higher level<br/>
songs. Some individual simply had a bad experiance and could not get selos<br/>
started because he happened to have a bad roll of the dice at an<br/>
inopportune time. And from that point on it just snowballed down hill and<br/>
he started to notice the missed notes because he was now thinking about<br/>
them unconsciously all the time. <br/>
