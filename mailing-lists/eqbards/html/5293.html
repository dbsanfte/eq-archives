This is all good stuff, and you may want to print it out for handy reference<br/>
Arkand Eagleseeker&#39;s Guide to Permafrost<br/>
<br/>
This is an entire file of spoilers. No question about it, you will get<br/>
spoiled.<br/>
<br/>

Ice Goblin Patriarch: L28+, abilities unknown. Load unknown.<br/>
The Sage: L28+, abilities unknown. Loaed unknown.<br/>
<br/>
How the place is laid out.<br/>
<br/>
There is only one path until you reach the flag room. So until you see the<br/>
flapping flag in a room, you can&#39;t get lost. L15 to 18 PC&#39;s should stick to<br/>
the zone edge and lure to there. Root MOB&#39;s, as there is a bug that will<br/>
cause MOB&#39;s to teleport.<br/>
<br/>
L19-21 can fight in the flag room. The spawn is fast here (15 minutes or<br/>
less), so two groups can simultaneously occupy the room. There is a safe<br/>
place off to the right as you enter. This alcove like area does not get<br/>
spawned on and is out of the MOB&#39;s sight as they get trained through the<br/>
room.<br/>
<br/>
L20-22 can go to the left side of the room by the cave like exit there and<br/>
find the door on the left. This leads to the house. Insode the first door is<br/>
the foyer, with two spawn points. There is a closet on either side of the<br/>
room. Throught he door straight ahead, there is dead end and a lone spawn on<br/>
the left, but the right passage leads to the house. Three spawn points in<br/>
the main room here, and typically two casters. This room is a good place to<br/>
use as a base camp for hitting the Archeologist, so I&#39;ll go there next.<br/>
<br/>
Go through the door in the main room. Here you will find another room, but<br/>
this one has a busted wall. This IS an archeologist we are talking about,<br/>
and he&#39;s been hard at work tracking his way deeper into an ancient Combine<br/>
Empire city. Just behind that wall, a goblin spawns, and luring it will draw<br/>
another. Now pass through the broken wall into the short tunnel. Here, you<br/>
will find a few more goblins, luring the front will bring three. Now that<br/>
the tunnel is clear, you will find you way into a large open area. There is<br/>
aplatform in front of you, with three goblins on it. to your left is a<br/>
overhanging bridge with one goblin on top and two further back underneath.<br/>
Luring from this room is an art. What you get depends on what you attack.<br/>
First, the Archeologist spawns on top of the snow mound just right of the<br/>
tombstone on the raised platform. Do not directly attack that spawn. Attack<br/>
the spawn to its right. This will bring four: the three from the platform<br/>
and the one on top of the bridge. So, that&#39;s the Archeologist spawn. Now,<br/>
for more fun, if you lure under that bridge on the left next, lure from the<br/>
right. If you lure the left of that two, you will get jumped by five or six,<br/>
but the one on the right is just out of attack range of a number of spawn<br/>
points, so you get two, and can grab the rest back there later. Now, right<br/>
of the platform, there is a passage. There is no spawn behind the door<br/>
there, so go ahead and look inside. I won&#39;t wpoil that interesting sight. It<br/>
may have a purpose... Anyway, further down that hall are more spawn points<br/>
worthy of a group of L21-23, so you can push deeper. I don&#39;t know how deep.<br/>
I though it only went back to two hollowed out caves, but an ally tells me<br/>
the passage continues.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, the Preacher. Back to the main room of the house. There you&#39;ll find a<br/>
hallway. Just run up that hallway, and you&#39;ll find a large room. Two spawns<br/>
on your immediate right as you enter, and three on the dais. This IS the<br/>
preacher room. Many Casters spawn here, so it can be lethal to break. There<br/>
are three weak spawns at the far rear behind the dais, but they do not join<br/>
in when you attack the preacher. Prelates can spawn on the dais, as well as<br/>
wizards. Priests are frequent spawns especially on the two floor spawns. At<br/>
the extreme rear of the room is a door. Behind that door is the Dire Wolf<br/>
room, and we don&#39;t exactly know what that leads to or entails. Early<br/>
experiences placed a Giant Dire Wolf (L47) down there, and we were not<br/>
interested in investigating further.<br/>
<br/>
Now we were also wanting that Alchemist, right? Okay, back to the Flag room.<br/>
Take the right exit from the flag room and you&#39;ll fight a few spawns and hit<br/>
a gate. Open the gate like a door and pass by the gate on the left. Do this<br/>
invis and /con ALL the spawns in front of you. They range up to at least L25<br/>
MOB&#39;s. Now, after clearing this out, you&#39;ll see a door and a rock on the<br/>
left of the door. Go to the rock and click on it like a door. It will slide<br/>
open. The Alchemist spawns behind that rock. Only one other spawns with it.<br/>
Now, behind the door, there are several groups of spawns, but I have not<br/>
pushed deep into that region, so I can&#39;t say much more about it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to the gates. Past the second gate (the one to the left as you<br/>
pass the first) is a good room for L24-28. The top level spawn is high blue<br/>
and even up to yellow. It takes good teamwork to hold this room at L24. At<br/>
the bottom of this room, though, is the Patriarch, the Sage, and the Elites.<br/>
A few will be yellow to L24&#39;s but most red, and the five spawns are close<br/>
together. There is further danger here: behind the door in the bottom of the<br/>
room is an Ice Giant Diplomat. Attacking anything close to the door can<br/>
bring it out and kill everyone in the dungeon. BE CAREFUL. I do not know how<br/>
to break the bottom spawn yet. An Elite has spawned on one of the higher<br/>
spawn points, but it was a 1/10 rate.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it, that&#39;s everything I know for certain. I can report that the<br/>
earlier reports of a wandering Giant Dire Wolf is now false: that Dire Wolf<br/>
was disabled in June and now seems to no longer wander, and it may not exist<br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have fun in Permafrost, I know I have. I made L20-24 in that<br/>
dungeon and I have no indication I won&#39;t get 25-28 there, too. I really<br/>
would like to try Unrest, but the exceptional MOB loads in Permafrost are<br/>
wanted by all in my company. Good luck, and good hunting!<br/>

The following comes to me third or fourth hand. I do NOT know the source.<br/>
The info seems correct, but I can not confirm at this time. I wish I could<br/>
credit the author, but that info was stripped off long before I saw this.<br/>
<br/>
This information pertains to what I called the Patriarch room. This is<br/>
actually the Throne room as you&#39;ll see by the alternate spawns. When I<br/>
visited, I only saw the Patriarch, 3 Elite Goblin Guards, and &quot;the  Goblin<br/>
Sage.&quot; We were not of a level to attack even that, the weakest of the spawns<br/>
there. I had a ranger on tracking, and he did not report the Ice Goblin<br/>
Honor Guard.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Symbol of Loyalty to Vox is common drop for King Thex`Ka IV in permafrost<br/>
(the ice goblin king). He is a fairly rare spawn, and symbol is a very high<br/>
demand item because everyone can wear it, including monks and mages. To kill<br/>
him, you need a good level 30-35 group, because the spawn points are<br/>
(common/rare spawn): <br/>
1) Elite Goblin Guard/Elite Honor Guard <br/>
2) Goblin Patriarch/High Priest Zaharn <br/>
3) Goblin Sage/none <br/>
4) Elite Goblin Guard/Elite Honor Guard <br/>
5) Elite Goblin Guard/King Thex`Ka IV <br/>
<br/>
Elite goblin guards are normal mid-high twenties warrior mobs, drop medium<br/>
bronze plate and fine steel weapons, elite honor guards are about level 30<br/>
and drop silvery axes (both 1H and 2H, 2H is rare drop), warriors as well,<br/>
the sage is NASTY, he just LOVES to rain fire and ice on groups, he can<br/>
single-handedly take out an unprepared group when backed up by<br/>
patriarch/zaharn who are level 30 or so clerics - with LOTS of mana.<br/>
Patriarch drops frost goblin totem (for crafted boots), High Priest Zaharn<br/>
drops Zaharn&#39;s Coronet (AC5 +3 STR +25 mana, priests only, no ogres or<br/>
trolls), sage drops nothing. King Thex`Ka IV spawns on the point closest to<br/>
the big double door, level 30 meleer, quite mean, although not nearly as bad<br/>
as the spellcasters (he did almost kill our level 29 wiz when he overburned<br/>
though). common drop on him is symbol of loyalty to vox, rare is white wolf<br/>
hide cloak (AC7 +3 STR +3 DEX... goodbye lizardscale). I personally wear<br/>
rubicite bracer because it goes well with other armor I have (especially<br/>
when in DE mode), bracer of erollisi on the other wrist. To find the room<br/>
with those goblins, enter permafrost, follow passage to flag room, follow<br/>
right wall in flag room to the big iron fence type gate, go through it to<br/>
see a small iron fence type door. Past that door is a big room, mostly<br/>
consisting of ledge and area under it where the juicy goblins spawns. Oh,<br/>
there is an ice giant diplomat past big double doors in back of the room,<br/>
killing him triggers spawn of goblin that has a chance of being the goblin<br/>
champion that drops crystalline blade (11/38 1HS... primary only, lore). The<br/>
diplomat is level 35 wizard, not very tough, drops throwing boulders. Do<br/>
NOT, repeat, do NOT go past the doors, there are VERY aggressive ice giants<br/>
past the diplomat, never seen a mob with aggression radius so wide, whenever<br/>
you turn around the corner, a pair of ice giants charges, one level 33, the<br/>
other level 40.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A look at lower guk!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This starts in the Dead side of the Lower Guk at the Tower Entrance.<br/>
<br/>
On your left you&#39;ll see 3 tal wizards, the one in the middle will<br/>
occasionally spawn as &quot;a ghoul ritualist&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This guy drops a Black Embroidered Cape (worn on shoulders), 4 ac, plus 15<br/>
mana, plus 20 hp, and black embroidered sleeves as the rare drop, which have<br/>
the same stats.  <br/>
<br/>
Go into the tower, pass the first ladder and make a left, you&#39;ll see another<br/>
ladder there, in a room with three froggies.<br/>
<br/>
Two named frogs spawn in there:<br/>
<br/>
The Ghoul Assasin, common drop Guise of the Deceiver, 4 ac, plus 13<br/>
charisma, plus 7 magic resist mask which has Illusion: Dark Elf.  Only bards<br/>
and rogues can wear the mask but anyone can use the effect from your<br/>
inventory.  His rare drop is a Serrated Bone Dirk, 8 damage, 26 delay<br/>
piercing weapon which procs encompassing darkness, rogue only.<br/>
<br/>
The Ghoul Supplier, common drop is a Light Burlap Sack, an 8 item holding<br/>
backpack which reduces weight by 70%, and his rare drop is one sweet as hell<br/>
belt, the Thick Banded Belt.  8 ac, plus 15 str, weight 0.5, ALL/ALL.  <br/>
<br/>
Walk down the stairs to the right of the ladder, clear the frogs, and you&#39;ll<br/>
come to a room with 5 frogs in it.  In one of these spots spawns a Ghoul<br/>
Savant.  He drops the black enameled mace as the common drop, 8 damage 28<br/>
delay mace, and black enameled chestplate as his rare drop, an AC25 black<br/>
plate chest, good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Go down the stairs, you get to the third floor.  Head straight right and<br/>
you&#39;ll enter a room with 4 jail cells and a platform in the middle.  On top<br/>
of the platform spawns the Ghoul Executioner, his booby drop is an<br/>
executioners hood, 5 ac, plus 4 str plus 9 dex leather hat, very nice for<br/>
rogue.  His rare drop is of course, the executioners axe, 25 damage, 50<br/>
delay, effect: Haste, warrior only 2h slashing weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Also to the right of the staircase you&#39;ll find a room with a book case in<br/>
it.  In there spawn the Ghoul Sage and Ghoul Scribe.  The sage drops a belt,<br/>
forget the name right now, that has 2 ac, plus 4 int, plus 8hp, and a rare<br/>
drop hat (forget the name), that gives 4 wis, 9 int.  The scribe&#39;s common<br/>
drop is a Parchment of Flayed Skin, most likely some quest item, and I don&#39;t<br/>
know what his rare drop is. <br/>
<br/>
To the left of the stairs you&#39;ll find a room with 3 frogs and a bed in it,<br/>
in there spawns the Ghoul Cavalier. His common drop are adamantite epolets,<br/>
9 ac plus 7 wis plate based shoulders, and his rare drop is the Dark Reaver,<br/>
a 20 damage 42 delay SK only slashing weapon, which procs steal strength.  <br/>
<br/>
Also to the left of the staircase you&#39;ll find another room with 3 frogs that<br/>
leads to the lobby, which you can also get to by dropping off the bridge<br/>
where the 3 tals are.  <br/>
<br/>
From the lobby, follow the path the hall and you&#39;ll get to a jail room with<br/>
4 cages, and 3 halls.  If you go straight, you&#39;ll have to clear out about 10<br/>
frogs ranging from wans to dars and their mage equivalents. Very tough<br/>
frogs. If you&#39;re good you can do these in pulls of 2.  Keep heading in and<br/>
you&#39;ll get to a long room with a trap in the center.  Avoid the trap.  If<br/>
you do fall in, it just drops you down a bit, you can make your way back up<br/>
the ladder NP.  On either side of the trap there is a room.  The left room<br/>
has a pillar of water in it, swim up that and you&#39;ll find the Reanimated<br/>
Hand, with 1 dar guard.  The common drop off the hand are serpentine<br/>
bracers, 1 ac, plus 3 dex, plus 9 agi, plate looking, awesome bracers.  The<br/>
rare drop sucks, adamantite band, plus 75hp, minus 10 magic resist.    The<br/>
right room will lead to a ladder, not sure whats down there, and will loop<br/>
back around into a little bedroom where the Ghoul Arch Magi spawns. His<br/>
common drop are silver silk leggings, not sure on exact stats, but they have<br/>
4 ac and I believe some plus int.  His rare drop is either a Robe of the<br/>
Archmage or a Shiny Metallic Robe, don&#39;t have stats as I haven&#39;t seen this<br/>
item myself, apparently it&#39;s great though.<br/>
<br/>
Keep heading straight, you&#39;ll run into maybe 10 more frogs, and you&#39;ll get<br/>
to the Ghoul Lord.  Don&#39;t even attempt this without a full group of level<br/>
45+, or 2 full groups of levels 40+, this bugger is NASTY.  Doubles for 125,<br/>
Harm Touches for close to 500, and has over 8000 hitpoints.  He also has 2<br/>
guards in his room, either dar knights, bok knights (level 43 to 46) or jin<br/>
wizards (43 to 46).  Fighting all 3 of these combined is basically suicide<br/>
unless you have a killer high group, so you&#39;ll need to pull 1 of these solo.<br/>
I&#39;m not going to get into the intricasies of Aggro Radius pulling, but if<br/>
you have a skilled puller he should be able to figure it out.  The ghoul<br/>
lord&#39;s common drop is a skull shaped barbute, a 13 ac, plus 35 hp, plus 10<br/>
magic resist plate helm, and his rare drop is the Shortsword of the Ykesha,<br/>
8 damage, 24 delay 1h slasher which procs ykesha, a 70 damage DD spell.<br/>
<br/>
If you take the left path of the prison type room you get to some froglok<br/>
slave camp, and if you take the right path you get to a serious maze like<br/>
area with 40+ frogs crawling all over the place.  This way leads to the<br/>
Ghoul Sentinel (drops brigandine tunic) and the Frenzied Ghoul, which drops<br/>
the flowing black silk sash.  From what I&#39;ve gathered this path is harder<br/>
than the path to the ghoul lord, so you don&#39;t have a prayer unless you&#39;re<br/>
with at least one full group of 45+.</div>
