<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169825753">In beta anthem d&#39;arms doubled the attack speed of the group. The effect of<br/>
this<br/>
was that groups with bards were going from level 10 to level 20 and higher<br/>
in<br/>
ridiculously short periods of time. A bard enabled group was like a lawn<br/>
mower cutting<br/>
down mobs like crazy. Now the song speeds up your rate by about 20%<br/>
which I believe was the original intention. People that got to use it in the<br/>
former scenario cried and cried that the song had been &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;ruined&quot;<br/>
when in fact<br/>
it was really out of whack and needed to be balanced.<br/>

&gt; 	When you say &#39;VERY much sped up&#39; are you referring to some<br/>
&gt; time in Beta or<br/>
&gt; currently? Someone I know who was a 35th level bard in Beta said 7 and 10<br/>
&gt; were broken and would give tremendous speed when played together but they<br/>
&gt; have been &#39;fixed&#39; to not double on the attack speed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	Good Journey,<br/>

&gt; The Anthem is much better, since it increases your attack speed.  The<br/>
&gt; effect is subtle, but it is definately there, believe me.  It also<br/>
&gt; stacks with Jonthan&#39;s Warsong, so your attack speed is VERY much sped<br/>
&gt; up, and your strength increases by a huge amount.  I play these two<br/>
&gt; songs when soloing even now at level 17.  (And even higher with my high<br/>
&gt; level bard in Beta).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just got anthem de arms, and really wondering whether the ol&#39;<br/>
&gt; chant might<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; better for a group (since I notice both can&#39;t be juggled).  I suppose<br/>
&gt; Anthem<br/>
&gt; &gt; de arms is better, rather have 10 strength over some dex and strength?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe I&#39;ll use the chant and whistle when alone, and anthem with groups.<br/>
&gt; Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that what others do?<br/>
