<div id="ygrps-yiv-449396755">I&#39;m gonna argue some of this out of order:<br/>
<br/>
At 12:33 AM 6/12/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Imagine if something like this is instituted.. performing a song would<br/>
&gt;take no time at all..you hit your /script macro, and then you&#39;re done..<br/>
&gt;5 seconds.. consider this announcement..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m actually in favour of delays in scripts, notice the anti-spam thoughts<br/>
I put in (maximum linelength, etc.)  Perhaps I should also suggest a<br/>
mandatory line delay based on input length?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Soerbaird Concert, this sunday!<br/>
&gt;Starts: 5pm<br/>
&gt;there will be 9 singers!<br/>
&gt;After the concert we will meet at an inn for drinks!<br/>
&gt;(Figure 5:15 at the latest)<br/>
&gt;Be there!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take it from the winner of the First Bardic Competition on Elanthia - it&#39;s<br/>
NEVER going to be that fast ;)  We&#39;re bards, remember?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It just doesn&#39;t seem as real.  A good decent length song (with a fast<br/>
&gt;typist) takes about as long to type as it does to sing in RL (once you<br/>
&gt;figure in pauses for musical solos and such).. a five minute RL song<br/>
&gt;would take about that much time (give or take) to do in EQ.  I like<br/>
&gt;this, and a script command would just resort concerts to the following..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I feel that adding a mandatory pause based on line length (minimum 3<br/>
second pause between lines, + 3 seconds for every 20 words)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It just seems so impersonal.  *shrugs* just my opinion, take it as you<br/>
&gt;will, I&#39;ve rambled enough.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that EQ is different from the text-based muds we all want to<br/>
emulate, and I&#39;m incredibly excited about the visual aspect to gaming - but<br/>
until voice-com becomes standard (*grin* one, maybe two years?), typing is<br/>
a significant hassle.  I personally have a repetoire of nearly a hundred<br/>
songs - but typing just a set (4-6 songs) would leave my hands so cramped I<br/>
couldn&#39;t type for a week after that.  Call me selfish - but I&#39;d like a<br/>
shortcut :P<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I like the manual imput for a few reasons.  But mostly for the<br/>
&gt;atmosphere.  It doesn&#39;t seem very personal when someone just spams out a<br/>
&gt;song 10 lines at a time.  I&#39;ve always loved the time it takes to type<br/>
&gt;out each line.. it adds suspence to the story.. (or song).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(&quot;Imput&quot; he says - I wonder if that was intentional?)<br/>
Most typists who play (if they&#39;re lucky) type from 40-60 wpm.  This can<br/>
make the average 3 minute song last about... 10 minutes.  I&#39;d hate to see a<br/>
Bardic with only 10 people under those conditions (I&#39;m used to 30+<br/>
competitors, using scripts, and the competition lasts upwards of 3 hours.)<br/>

Thanks for listening<br/>
