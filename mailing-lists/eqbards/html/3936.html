<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370665478">Yes Sol B is extremly good for Medium Bronze it&#39;s very common there. While<br/>
I&#39;m not quite ready for it I have a friend who is there quite a bit and he<br/>
recently told me about it. Basically though all his group does is sell it to<br/>
a vendor so I imagine other groups may do this after they&#39;ve been there long<br/>
enough. You may be able to head there and auction about it one thing is<br/>
though you&#39;ll have to wait till the group works it&#39;s way back out of  the<br/>
zone because of the spawns in the dungeon but you may be able to get medium<br/>
bronze there cheap.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Kind of off-topic, but I know all our human and half-elf<br/>
&gt;&gt;compatriots are eagerly looking for this stuff.  We got our<br/>
&gt;&gt;first piece of medium bronze last night.  It was off a L25<br/>
&gt;&gt;goblin we pulled from deep in the cave system past the<br/>
&gt;&gt;Archeologist.  That would put it at roughly the same level as<br/>
&gt;&gt;the dry bones and nobles that most often drop small bronze in<br/>
&gt;&gt;Unrest; except that everything trains in Permafrost and you<br/>
&gt;&gt;can&#39;t use Accelerando/SoW, thus requiring a much higher level<br/>
&gt;&gt;group to survive there, much less get this stuff.<br/>

&gt;Ok, that;s enough space....<br/>
&gt;Our group has been finding Medium Bronze by the boat-load in Solusek B.<br/>
&gt;Oh, yeah, sure, it can be a nasty dungeon, but here&#39;s a few ideas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. We have found that medium bronze in Sol B is just as plentiful as Small<br/>
&gt;Bronze is in Unrest. I collected 5 pieces of Medium Bronze in less than 2<br/>
&gt;hours!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2. Who carries it? Just about any Kobold.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3. Sol B, right near the entry. Camp there with your group. Right around<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;corner, start luring Kobolds, one at a time. A group of mid 20&#39;s with at<br/>
&gt;least once cleric SHOULD be able to handle a single kobold. If things get<br/>
&gt;hairy, you are RIGHT by the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4. Whether they do or do not have bronze on them, repeat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5. Season to taste. I just ended up giving 4 of those pieces away to fellow<br/>
&gt;bards who require medium armor. Who says you can&#39;t have Christmas in July?<br/>
