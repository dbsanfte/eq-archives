<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on our snare songs.  That really irks me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with that!  Of course they&#39;ve never fixed root, which allegedly only<br/>
gives mobs a save when they take damage.  (My cleric has countless times,<br/>
parked a mob away from the group with attack turned off and had them break<br/>
early).<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that all snares were supposed to have a random duration,<br/>
and they messed up the spells.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I&#39;m all for it!</div>
