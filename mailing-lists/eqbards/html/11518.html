The words: &quot;I will take a look at this&quot; are missing.  I don&#39;t get the<br/>
feeling that GZ recognizes it as a bug. My read is that he is brushing it<br/>
off as &#39;anecdotal evidence&#39; and one player&#39;s opinion rather than accepting<br/>
the possibility of a bug or unintentional change.  Or he was just giving a<br/>
quick answer because he was in a forum where he was being asked lots and<br/>
lots of questions.<br/>
