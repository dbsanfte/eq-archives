<div id="ygrps-yiv-84407306">Ok, now that&#39;s a bug I&#39;ve never seen.  What an idiot GM though.  It is not<br/>
common for orcs to spawn above the lift, wth is that?  I&#39;ve spent the first<br/>
10 levels of 6 different characters on 3 servers in GF and have never heard<br/>
of orcs spawning above the lift.  What color is the sky in this guy&#39;s world<br/>
that he doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s a bug?  Does he live in the OOT where the<br/>
compass is all messed up?  Has anyone ever heard of this before?  By that<br/>
reasoning no one should ever get rezzed when found dead at a &#39;safe point&#39;,<br/>
&#39;cause &quot;its fairly common to find dead bodies at a safe point&quot;.  I can just<br/>
imagine this guy&#39;s response to petitions like &quot;I&#39;m trapped in the cat room<br/>
can you get me out&quot;.  Oh, no sorry, its pretty common to get trapped in the<br/>
&#39;cat&#39; room, look at all the npc&#39;s there.<br/>

This was my second petition.  First was at 6th lvl<br/>
when  Orc Centurians were spawning atop the Orc lift<br/>
in Klelthin.  We retreated from Orc Hill because the<br/>
volume was too much for us.  Kept getting faction<br/>
messages even tho we weren&#39;t fighting any more....got<br/>
to the bottom of the lift and rested.  Kept getting<br/>
faction messages.<br/>
<br/>
The guards at Kelethin are a bit dense...we were<br/>
attacked again and again.  We moved to the top of the<br/>
lift....kept on getting faction messages.<br/>
<br/>
Resting at the top of the lift, faction messages<br/>
continued.  Cents were spawning among us and<br/>
attacking.<br/>
<br/>
My petition was answered by GM Traikis who told me: <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s fairly common for orcs to spawn above the lift.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was not impressed.  <br/>
<br/>
The faction messages continued until we all died and<br/>
then the orcs stopped spawning around us<br/>

&gt; &gt;That&#39;s what I thought too, but apparently the<br/>
&gt; teleport spot for <br/>
&gt; &gt;Butcherblock<br/>
&gt; &gt;is at about 10,000 ft.  You immediately fall and<br/>
&gt; take 10,000 points anyhow<br/>
&gt; &gt;which is as you can guess instantly fatal.  Not<br/>
&gt; good when you are bound in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Halas at the time as I was.  The GM&#39;s never<br/>
&gt; responded to my petition even<br/>
&gt; &gt;though I was beneath the world and was supposedly<br/>
&gt; teleported to a &quot;safe<br/>
&gt; &gt;spot&quot;<br/>
