&gt; Song #8, Keliens Lubrous Lament (sp) is a WONDERFUL addition to your<br/>
&gt; bardsong list. If you want to wow your friends, try this: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Find 2-5 mobs that you want to fight, but don&#39;t want to fight all at<br/>
&gt;    once. (ie. if you attack one, they all come running)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. &#39;Lament&#39; (Make em sad) the ones you DON&#39;T want to fight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. Attack one of the ones you DO want to fight, pull it back a ways (to<br/>
&gt;    get out of the aggro range of his buddies)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I would advise lamenting them all, starting from the<br/>
lowest /con mob first.  Then pulling the one you want.<br/>
<br/>
What this does is decrease the chance that lament will fail<br/>
causing a large portion of the camp to attack you.  Lamenting<br/>
the lowest level ones first has a higher chance of succeeding.  <br/>
When you lament the harder ones, if you fail then at least<br/>
easier ones will not come.  If you succeed, well, then you can<br/>
pull which ever one you want.<br/>
<br/>
Of course my charisma is 140 so it almost never fails.  Your<br/>
mileage may vary with a lower charisma.<br/>
