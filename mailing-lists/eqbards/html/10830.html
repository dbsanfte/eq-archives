<div id="ygrps-yiv-208374784">As I have recently started to use charm to solo, I thought I would post<br/>
my method here.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: This tactic was taken directly from a previous post, most<br/>
likely by John Kim, I am just restating it, along with my observations.<br/>
<br/>
I have been using charm to solo Cyclopses and Wooly Mammoths, Mammoths<br/>
are a breeze using Charm, here is the tactic: <br/>
<br/>
1. Find 2 Mammoths<br/>
2. Charm the strongest one, when you have it charmed (no resist message)<br/>
target other and hit your /pet attack button.<br/>
3. Hit F1 twice to retarget your pet (since it is hard to tell which one<br/>
is yours)<br/>
4. Start Selo&#39;s and back away 100-200 feet. You usually have time to<br/>
start TWO songs before charm fails, I usually sing Hymn, then Selo&#39;s<br/>
then wait for charm to fail<br/>
5. When Mammoths start charging you, stop Selo&#39;s and recharm your pet,<br/>
he will immediately attack the other Mammoth (you may need to back away<br/>
while singing charm, so the mammoths don&#39;t hit you)<br/>
6. Stop singing charm, start Selo&#39;s <br/>
7. Repeat until one Mammoth dies (hopefully not the one your charmed :)<br/>
8. Switch to weapons and chain/fear the last one to death (should be<br/>
easy at this point)<br/>
<br/>
Using this technique, I have killed many mammoths, although I have to<br/>
say when I started this, they were already blue to me. Cyclops work the<br/>
same way, except that the endgame is much more risky. <br/>
<br/>
I have also noticed that if your pet starts losing and you decide to<br/>
switch sides, most of the time, your old pet will run after you ignoring<br/>
the damage dealt by the new pet. If you want to be safe, stick to just<br/>
one, even if he loses. If you want max XP, try chaining the old pet so<br/>
the new one can whack him enough that he ignores you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, FYI, the named Cyclops in Rathe Mountains &quot;Tarskusk&quot; was yellow to<br/>
me and I was able to charm him, but he would not respond to my commands.<br/>
I was able to kill him by having a druid snare him, and while he was<br/>
hell-bent on killing me, I charmed another cyclops which killed him for<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I also have used charm, when my group gets an &quot;Extra&quot; on the pull. Makes<br/>
a world of difference to switch from fighting 2 icy orcs, to fighting<br/>
one, and having the other Tank for you.<br/>
