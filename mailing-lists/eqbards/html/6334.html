<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167337924">From what I observed before 96 is a base AC breakpoint for agility, that is<br/>
a naked AC is better at 96 than at 95.  101 is a AC multiplier breakpoint,<br/>
that is the amount a piece of ac10 armor improves your ac goes up when you<br/>
go from 100 to 101.  I didn&#39;t have enough resources to definitively check<br/>
this before, but now that I do I will make an effort to examine it<br/>
thoroughly this weekend.<br/>

I was gonna say, NO agi does not raise AC, but made a final test just to be <br/>
sure. =)<br/>
With a base AGI of 90, no AGI items and nothing in ear and finger slots I <br/>
equipped a total of four +2 AGI (no other stats or AC) rings and earrings. <br/>
As I added the third item and my AGI went to 96 my AC increased from 423 to <br/>
425. Not much but increased it did, and since others have suggested that <br/>
there is a difference between 100 and 101 AGI one might draw the conclusion <br/>
that AC increases in 5 AGI steps...<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope AGI also make them hit you less often...a 2 AC increase is not <br/>
gonna save my life to often lol<br/>

wonders why his AC seem to drop the more he lvls and the more plats he spend<br/>

&gt;There are agility bonuses that differ when you hit certain points.  I had a<br/>
&gt;100 agility and an AC of around 200 or so when I got my first agility<br/>
&gt;boosting item.  Going from 100 to 102 with no attached AC bumped my AC up <br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt;9 points.  Not sure if there are bonuses at points past 101, but I would<br/>
&gt;imagine they get spread out at that point.  I checked with a new character<br/>
&gt;and 101 is definitely better than 100 and 110 is no different from 101.<br/>
&gt;Could not add enough points to reach 111 so could not check that, will try<br/>
&gt;with a halfling rogue to see if bonuses really do continue past 101, and<br/>
&gt;will report back on Monday.<br/>
