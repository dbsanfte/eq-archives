<div id="ygrps-yiv-314356751">yeah the more i read their post the more i think they have 20 different exp<br/>
tables.  the &#39;&#39;creating exp out of thin air&#39;&#39; is the clincher for me.  but that is<br/>
where the other guy was coming from and how i read it the first time i saw<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; with just the formula.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think I understand this now, and I believe we already have the <br/>
&gt;answer.  The previous exp penalty is not actually a penalty perse, by <br/>
&gt;this I mean that there is no actual exp being docked per kill.  Bards <br/>
&gt;would actually physically need 1400 exp points to level, rather than <br/>
&gt;1000.  Check with the people running ShowEQ to be sure.  The amount <br/>
&gt;of EXP their character is receiving is the same regardless of class.  <br/>
&gt;The EXP Bar is just larger.  Also, the way VI is introducing this <br/>
&gt;change is extremelly and confusing if they&#39;re using one table <br/>
&gt;and &quot;knocking off&quot; experience based on the classes.  Plus, I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;see clearly how they (pre-patch) would divide the experience based <br/>
&gt;off how much experience you have, i.e. a Bard at level 40 would have <br/>
&gt;more than a Cleric at level 40.  From your suggestion, the Bard would <br/>
&gt;actually have the exact same amount, but it would have come from more <br/>
&gt;kills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If this is what you mean by the exp penalty COULD have been moved, <br/>
&gt;then I am confident that it&#39;s not.  I&#39;m pretty sure that they&#39;re <br/>
&gt;using seperate tables for each class/race combination rather than 1 <br/>
&gt;overall table by all the other evidence available to us.<br/>
