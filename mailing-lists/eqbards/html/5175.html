<div id="ygrps-yiv-204382681">Let&#39;s consider the possibility that it (the missed note bug) may not happen<br/>
_for_everyone_ - _all_of_the_time_.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very possible that there is a bug but it does not affect everyone the<br/>
same way. <br/>
<br/>
Verant changes things all of the time.  I am sure they test things before<br/>
they publish the change to everyone.  But they can&#39;t test it such that the<br/>
results are completely predictable for all clients.  Example: they just did<br/>
something with a spell called &quot;Ensnare&quot; It was supposed to last longer than<br/>
a regular snare.  But after it was released - it became known - thru player<br/>
testing that it was not performing correctly.  So, the spell guy looked into<br/>
it and made a change.  Do you think he just released it without testing<br/>
it??? No.  But even though he tested - it was not until a general release<br/>
that it became known that there was a problem.<br/>
<br/>
So.... it&#39;s very possible that the recent change to missed notes on high<br/>
level songs is related to something they changed BUT it does NOT affect<br/>
everyone.  Example: I do not notice any more missed note than before.  I am<br/>
a low level player (just made 20) and don&#39;t own and so have never memorized<br/>
or played the songs that had the missed note problem they were(are) trying<br/>
to fix.  MAYBE it only affects players who have the &quot;missed note&quot; songs that<br/>
they were trying to fix???<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the missed note problem affects some but not others.  Perhaps<br/>
this is a clue towards getting it fixed?<br/>

		Look, I for one am getting tired of the nay-sayers on this<br/>
missed note<br/>
		thing. Last night I couldnt even get Denons to start I<br/>
missed notes 10 times<br/>
		in a row and finally erased it from my list and added a<br/>
different song. ALL<br/>
		my skills are over 190, my Dex is a base of 124, char is<br/>
110, there is a<br/>
		problem. I am a level 38 Bard and I KNOW when something has<br/>
changed with the<br/>
		way I play. So knock off the black helicopter crap, you dont<br/>
have a clue<br/>
		what your talking about. This is a very serious problem in<br/>
how the Bard is<br/>
		played, it means we cannot twist songs like we used to<br/>
effectively. I cannot<br/>
		depend on Chaining a fleeing mob like I used to be able to.<br/>
In fact I find<br/>
		myself anticipating that missed note, hovering over that<br/>
hotkey waiting to<br/>
		push it again when I miss. Its too bad if you dont play<br/>
enough to notice a<br/>
		huge change like this, or arent observant enough to notice<br/>
it, but dont tell<br/>
		us we are imagining things.<br/>

		Tested with a bard who just turned 36th:<br/>
<br/>
		Clarity (32): 4/100<br/>
		Accelerando (5): 3/100<br/>
		Chant (1): 3/100<br/>
		Celerity (36): 15/100<br/>
<br/>
		Celerity&#39;s higher failure rate is reasonable, given that the<br/>
Singing skill<br/>
		isn&#39;t maxed for the level yet.  As I suggest, run the<br/>
numbers for yourself.<br/>
		Now go back to looking for the black helicopters.<br/>
