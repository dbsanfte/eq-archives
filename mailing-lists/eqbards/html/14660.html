when I received a tell asking about my greaves (This was right after I had won my<br/>
imbrued greaves).  So I said what they were, from where, and the stats.  And this<br/>
young bard floored me by saying he was amazed that I took the time to answer, let<br/>
alone volunteer information.  I was shocked to find out from him that &#39;high levels&#39;<br/>
sometimes completely ignore and sometimes are rude to people who contact them.  I<br/>
guess I was pretty lucky picking the high level bards I bugged at a young age<br/>
(mostly it was Rynn Shada).<br/>
<br/>
[An aside to the water/food purchase - I have started foraging again the last two<br/>
levels.  I can feed myself but water is just too rare to be enough.]<br/>
<br/>
The twist to the story: this little level 4 bard is also a level 50 paladin I know<br/>
pretty well.  I like to think I inspired him to start a bard haha (hey it&#39;s fun to<br/>
think so ;P).<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree with Harmonic; I like to just be nice to people.  It isn&#39;t really<br/>
selfless at all - it pays off in so many ways =).<br/>
