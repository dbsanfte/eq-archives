 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a bug.  It has to do with a misappropriation of damage or something<br/>
when a pet is involved with a group.  I&#39;ve seen it happen many times, for<br/>
example a group is holding the stone spider room in solusek B when a<br/>
ranger shows up to await a fire giant run.  The group has a necro in it<br/>
with a pet, and on multiple occasions the single ranger gets the<br/>
experience instead of the group of six.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t claim to know how credit toward the kill works, but I&#39;ve seen this<br/>
occur enough times to surmise the cause.<br/>
