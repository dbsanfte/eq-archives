<b>Subject:</b> New art download *SPOILER!!!* <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519446876">OKay - well, it&#39;s not so much an IN-game spoiler, but some people were <br/>
asking on another forum about what the new download was the past two <br/>
days.  For those who don&#39;t want spoilage, it&#39;s art.  For the front <br/>
end.  Not in-game art.  And it relates to Kunark.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that was overly spoiled, was it?<br/>
Anyway - for the rest of you rotten eggs - you know the routine:<br/>

In addition to new logos (you should have noticed by now the change to the <br/>
Verant splash screen - it&#39;s subtle, but it&#39;s there), there are also new <br/>
splash screens for Sony and 989.  Also, they have made new login and EQ <br/>
splash screens in prep for Kunark.  Beautiful art, Parkinson is on top again.<br/>
