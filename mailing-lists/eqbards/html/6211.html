<div id="ygrps-yiv-478190248">Look for some of these items, they may help you out in the short to long<br/>
term with your STR problems:<br/>
 <br/>
Bracer of Erollisi is 2AC +5STR, you can only have one at a time (LORE ITEM)<br/>
so if you put the Erollisi bracer on one arm and then put your bronze bracer<br/>
on the other, the graphic for the bronze will show up on both of your<br/>
Avatar&#39;s arms even though you have the Erollisi bracer on (leather based).<br/>
With a group you might be able to get one yourself, the Captain drops them<br/>
almost every time.<br/>
 <br/>
Jagged Band is AC5 STR+3 and I have seen them for as low as 80pp on E&#39;ci,<br/>
you are far too young to camp for it on your own<br/>
 <br/>
Bloodstained mantle is AC6 STR+3 magic+10 and sells for as low as 30 or 35pp<br/>
on E&#39;ci, again an item you are a bit to young to camp yourself.<br/>
 <br/>
As a bard, keep an eye out for the Trollhide belt, AC5 STR+5 STA+5, although<br/>
this item probably sells for 100-150pp - just an FYI<br/>
 <br/>
I personally wear 2 +5CHA 2AC Opalline earrings because I did not make my<br/>
natural CHA so high to start with, but for you, you could look for STR<br/>
increasing earrings instead to help out as well.<br/>

<br/>
Hail and well met fellow bards of Norrath,<br/>
 <br/>
I come to you today with several small problems looking for assistance and<br/>
advice.  When I first joined this list, you all seemed to think that the<br/>
major component of a bard&#39;s attributes was Charisma, so on all of the<br/>
suggestions I axed my human bard with low charisma (who&#39;s body I could not<br/>
recover anywho) and made my half-elf bard with a whopping 110 starting<br/>
charisma.  Anyway.....<br/>
 <br/>
That has now come back to bite me in the ass.  I am now at level 20<br/>
(FINALLY!!!!!!) and am in search of bronze plate.  Unfortunately, med bronze<br/>
seems incredibly rare (and expensive-I still haven&#39;t found the cash cow that<br/>
everyone talks about hehe) to purchase.  So I am now in Permafrost where the<br/>
bronze lives.  So now I have 3 pieces-breastplate, sleeves (vambraces,<br/>
whatever) and a mask.  Only problem is that now I am only 10 from my total<br/>
carrying weight (which is a whopping 82 buffed).  I plan on just getting the<br/>
visible pieces, minus the boots-they just seem so uncomfortable.  With a<br/>
pair of greaves, one bracer and the helm, I shan&#39;t be able to carry anything<br/>
anymore!<br/>
 <br/>
Here are my questions:<br/>
 <br/>
Please tell me of STR items it would be possible for me to get.  (I have one<br/>
ring (I forget what kind) +2, and a purity belt, and a spiked collar.)<br/>
Please bear in mind that I am poor (50pp in the bank on a good day) and I<br/>
like to live.<br/>
Also if any other people out there know off the cuff, who drops the greaves<br/>
(bronze leggings) and the bronze helm in Permafrost.  Is it a named somebody<br/>
or is it a random thing?<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you all in advance!<br/>
