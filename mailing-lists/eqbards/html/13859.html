<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907257277">Not totally as it would force someone to hunt down 12 randomly placed named<br/>
mobs to get a Ykesha quality item rather than just waiting around until one<br/>
named mob spawned somewhere and then going after that.  Especially since it<br/>
would mean only a ranger or other tracker would be likely to get the special<br/>
mob if there was one you could go after with a big payoff.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You&#39;d still end up with people camping the container and<br/>

&gt; &gt; discouraged camping, you&#39;ve just made it so pulling other<br/>
&gt; &gt; nearby mobs (which most campers do anyway) is more important.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not if the named mobs were all over the place...  i wouldnt mind them<br/>
&gt; wandering either...   Just makes things bit harder to do...<br/>

If the named mobs were all over the place, then the container<br/>
and widget system is redundant.  :)  <br/>
