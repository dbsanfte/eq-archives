<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783238272">I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.  I was hoping to do this quest but can&#39;t<br/>
get my faction high enough with the Deepwater Knights in Erudin to get the<br/>
Guild master to give me the quest or any other quest for that matter.  I<br/>
used the Charismatic Carillon to get me up to indifferent but that is as<br/>
High as I can go.<br/>
<br/>
I also looked to see if there were any other ways to raise my faction but<br/>
could only find the Odus Pearl quest which raises faction with the Knights.<br/>
Unfortunately, it is given by the same guy in the guild and needs a<br/>
container he gives you to complete it.  Again, he won&#39;t talk to me about any<br/>
quests.<br/>
<br/>
Kitasi, you are the king of quests from what I hear, maybe you know what I<br/>
can do.  Or if, in fact it is a lost cause.  Anyone who has any info can<br/>
share, not just Kit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
