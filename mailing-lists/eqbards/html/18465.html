<div id="ygrps-yiv-787612170">My advice is to get in on as many naggy raids as you can.  Even if you don&#39;t<br/>
get a Selo&#39;s drum one of the other bards there will.  And they&#39;ll likely<br/>
give you their MM Drums as a hand-me-down since they won&#39;t need them anymore<br/>
(SHH Don&#39;t tell them the Drums of the March are too fast for Song of Travel<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Mistmoor Drum Goes Poof<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The last month has been a blast singing Chant of Flame and Fufils<br/>
&gt; with my Mistmoor Drum... I was dropping Blues fast, mixing in a<br/>
&gt; fear chain every so often... Then, yesterday I was switching from my<br/>
&gt; lute, had the pointer over it and the Drum went &quot;Poof&quot; !!!<br/>
&gt;   I backed up and searched the ground in a panic. Nothing there !!! I<br/>
&gt; petitioned and when the guide finally showed up her attitude<br/>
&gt; initially was &quot;Tough Toenails&quot;.. I finally talked her into reporting<br/>
&gt; it to Verant as a possible Bug and if they review my log I MAY or may<br/>
&gt; not get a replacement. Moonflower is Disconsolate.. I love that drum.<br/>
&gt;  Now the question is... at level 42, what are the chances of getting<br/>
&gt; a Drum of Selos March as a replacement ?  ..rare drop off Nagafen ?<br/>
&gt; Any tips ?<br/>
&gt;       I appreciate any advice you guys can give me,<br/>
&gt;       Moonflower Bllue, 42 Bard<br/>
