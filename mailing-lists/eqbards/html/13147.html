<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392793266"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; P.S. Harm the Tranix crown is definitely NOT (caps just for you) no drop.<br/>
&gt; the only things no drop on FGs are mithril torque and mask and skarlon<br/>
&gt; sword.  did that cleric loot one of those?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Wasn&#39;t there, so I cannot say exactly what it was.  But I heard the<br/>
  Head GM confirmed that once the item was taken from the cleric, it<br/>
  was in fact King Tranix&#39;s Crown and it was nodrop.  Where it was a<br/>
  bug or not, the GM had to remove the crown from the cleric&#39;s inventory<br/>
  to destroy it.  That&#39;s what I heard anyway.  It could be like the mask<br/>
  or guise, same item - changed properties, old ones left intact.<br/>
<br/>
  Everyone I know however says the crown is most definitely tradable, <br/>
  but none of them have looted a crown within the past 2 weeks.  Did<br/>
  your server get a crown in the last two weeks?  Could it have been<br/>
  changed?  I also heard only plate classes can wear the new one.<br/>
<br/>
