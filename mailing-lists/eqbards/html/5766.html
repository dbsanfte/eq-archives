<b>Message ID:</b> 5766 <br/>
<b>Date:</b> Fri Aug 27 22:38:23 BST 1999 <br/>
<b>Author:</b> Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 <br/>
<b>Subject:</b> Lets invite someone from Verant to join the list <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742174283">Perhaps the moderator of this list can send an email to Verant and request<br/>
that the bard programmer join this list.  Include in the message that we as<br/>
representatives of the EQ bard community are requesting this not so much as<br/>
a way for us to get detailed explanations of game mechanics but instead as a<br/>
way to get official confirmation on theories that we have tested and believe<br/>
to be true.  For example, if someone has a theory on how a song works, the<br/>
bard programmer could confirm if he was right or not.  If the response is<br/>
that the theory is wrong, thats all he has to say.  It would be up to us to<br/>
figure it out from there.  <br/>
<br/>
This may be wishful thinking on my part but its worth a shot.  If the<br/>
moderator doesn&#39;t want to write the letter, I can do it.  Either way I think<br/>
the message should be posted here first for us to agree it is worded good<br/>
enough to at least get a yes/no response.<br/>
