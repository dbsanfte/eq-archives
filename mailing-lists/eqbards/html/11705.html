<div id="ygrps-yiv-46637005">You know what, Martyn,  I just re-read your plight, and I have to say two <br/>
things:<br/>
1) People who are that paranoid are usually guilty of it themselves.  If <br/>
they weren&#39;t exploiting, they were probably up to something just as bad.<br/>
2) As has been supported by GMs, Guides, and the programming of the game: <br/>
If someone leaves a corpse long enough for someone else to loot it, it&#39;s <br/>
FAIR GAME.  Their own darn fault.<br/>
3) The fact that you wanted to stay around and get a mask should have been <br/>
clue enough, but obviously they didn&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
The simple explanation for what happened is that occasionally, if a mob has <br/>
no loot, the corpse will vanish very quickly after dropping.  There never <br/>
was a mask, and they are idiots for accusing you.  Do what I do.  Ignore them.<br/>
