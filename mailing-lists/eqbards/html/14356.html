<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-826462918">Q: Will twisting ever be coded against? I.e. is it considered cheating? If <br/>
it is, I definitely want to know about it now.<br/>
A: Twisting is not cheating. It won´┐¢t be coded against. We are even looking <br/>
at putting a little something extra in to help the people with slower <br/>
machines twist better, while not allowing those with faster machines to <br/>
twist more often.<br/>
<br/>
Me: This could be very interesting.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Q: If any instruments raise song effectiveness, can you please have that <br/>
listed when we examine it?<br/>
A: Using an instrument will always increase the effect of a song - assuming <br/>
that type of song can be increased by an instrument (example: Any set of <br/>
Drums will make you run faster when playing Selo´┐¢s Accelerando). Some <br/>
instruments will increase your effect more then others. The same new display <br/>
code that is going in to help with the Song/Skill identification will also <br/>
display instrument bonus/penalties.<br/>
<br/>
Me: Penalties?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Q: Can you explain your thoughts behind Psalm of Purity and Psalm of <br/>
Vitality? These songs are simply useless since any 5th level druid and 4th <br/>
level cleric can cure the disease and poison these songs are supposed to <br/>
protect from. I mean truly 39 points of disease protection for a 29th level <br/>
song?<br/>
A: These songs, in addition to protecting from poison and disease, also have <br/>
chances to remove a poison or disease effect on you. They are a mixture of a <br/>
cure and a resistance buff in one.<br/>
<br/>
Me: Has anyone ever seen this work? I know Raiel did some tests in newbie <br/>
areas and had no success.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the <br/>
following: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon, Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, Solon&#39;s Song <br/>
of the Sirens, Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike, and Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles?<br/>
A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance, none.<br/>
<br/>
Me: If Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens is not enhanced be equiping a flute then <br/>
why is it listed as a wind song? Using a flute with Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike <br/>
does not increase the MR debuff.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Q: I play a shaman. This is perhaps a bit off the mark, but I was wondering <br/>
what are the best buffs for a bard? For example, I recently discovered ´┐¢ <br/>
that dexterity helps a bard, as does charisma. Any other buffs that a wise <br/>
bard should be asking for?<br/>
A: Charisma and Dexterity are the best Buffs. Most Bards that I know can <br/>
also always use a few more points of strength - their armor usually puts <br/>
them dangerously close to encumbrance. AC & HP buffs are also nice - most <br/>
denizens of Norrath have an inexplicable hatred of music and tend to take it <br/>
out on nearby minstrels.<br/>
<br/>
Me: **Warning Sarcasm Alert** I do not think the hatred of muscian&#39;s in <br/>
Norrath is limited to the Mobs....<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Overall not much in the way of useful info. We do get teased with an upgrade <br/>
charm song though :-/ Also on a side note, Abashi mentioned in a reply on <br/>
the Sony EQ boards that due to the bug with the SLN damamge shield GZ found <br/>
**gasp** sign errors on how damage shields stack. He says these have been <br/>
fixed and should be in the next patch. Maybe this will fix how Psalm of <br/>
Cooling stacks.<br/>
