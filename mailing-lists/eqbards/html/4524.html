<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-851448560"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Does anyone think that bards should not be limited to memorizing only<br/>
&gt; eight songs at a time?  I just made 20th level and for the first time<br/>
&gt; had to think really hard on what songs I wanted to memorize.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem with this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a nasty limitation, but one I think balances things well. And trust<br/>
me, spellcasting classes have it just as hard. My druid has around 100<br/>
spells to choose from and the choices are hard. =)<br/>
