&gt;can 2 or more bards play the same song in a group?? I tried doing hymn of<br/>
&gt;Restoration one time while another bard in our group was,  and I kept<br/>
&gt;getting the (your song did not take hold) message, It may be just some songs<br/>
&gt;I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>restoration does not stack normally, you will get the not taking hold<br/>
message. Chorus of clarity however does stack with another bard. We have<br/>
had 2 bards and an enchanter casting clarity and the wizards where going<br/>
bananas. Lots of fun. I say normally cause last night me and another bard<br/>
accidently started the healing song at the same time and it stacked. We<br/>
didnt get the hold message and we where healing almost 40pts per tick! We<br/>
had tried this before and always gotten the hold message. So we where all<br/>
estatic about this till tonight when we tried the same trick and started<br/>
getting the hold message. Grrr, we have no idea what is going here, but the<br/>
songs WHERE stacking for a short time last night. Morale of the story, some<br/>
songs stack, others dont :)</div>
