<b>Subject:</b> Song Lock Whip? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-200002370">I use a tentical whip every once in a while. When it does the lifetap the song I am playing seems to lock. When this happens all the spell buttons turn back to normal and I cant start a song new because the other one is still going, nor can I stop it without haveing to log or zone. <br/>
<br/>
Has this happened to anyone else?<br/>
