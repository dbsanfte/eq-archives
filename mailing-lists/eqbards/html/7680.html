<div id="ygrps-yiv-490955826">I had written the list asking for the correct use of this song when I got<br/>
it at level 15.  I finally used it at level 18 in the gorge on some blue<br/>
mobs after a mini-train hit us.  I have to say it really did save the day<br/>
as it kept them nodding so that the 3 paladins and 2 wizzies could get the<br/>
elder muddites, chasm mino&#39;s and other assorted blue monsters dispensed<br/>
with.  I was fortunate enough to have explained about this song prior to<br/>
going to the gorge so that the Paladins were aware they needed to taunt the<br/>
monsters off me.  I have to say the monsters really really REALLY hated me<br/>
that night! We did well until someone trained the zone on top of our heads<br/>
but then again, my song or not, nothing could have helped.  Luckily Selo&#39;s<br/>
got us out in time (1 bub of health!).<br/>
<br/>
I am finding as I am going to more and more grouped dungeon settings that<br/>
the monsters are concentrating on me more than anyone else in the group. <br/>
Everyone is asking if I am singing chords or dissonance (which I don&#39;t use<br/>
for that reason) because it is so obvious the monsters have it out for me. <br/>
<br/>
Oh well I just tell everyone wood elves taste good. :)<br/>

one other thing to add, is that using this song the same level you get it<br/>
(15) will be less effective than a couple levels later.  so don&#39;t give up<br/>
on<br/>
it.  once you gain a few levels it will most likely save you and your<br/>
group&#39;s life more often than getting you killed.<br/>
