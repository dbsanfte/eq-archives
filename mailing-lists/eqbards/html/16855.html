<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818827783">Hi, just visited MM for the first time on late Saturday night (prolly<br/>
the worst time, few ppl there, so I saw and died to several trains).  My<br/>
question is where can my group and I hunt there (I&#39;m 21, the group<br/>
ranges to 26) fairly safely?  (The idea is to be in the zone for a while<br/>
and /auction WTB MM drum.  Anyone have a clue what those would go for?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 and my first view of Cazic: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/cazic.jpg">http://www.clandlc.com/cazic.jpg</a><br/>
Really encouraging for a  first time visit (my group decided that<br/>
Unrest is safer then Cazic)</div>
