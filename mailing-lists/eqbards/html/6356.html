<div id="ygrps-yiv-905853666">All of your songs and any spells should not work on a +PvP if your -PvP.<br/>
<br/>
As for turning PvP that&#39;s a bunch of nonsense.<br/>

    Recently, I joined a group with a +pvp player.  I&#39;m somewhat superstitious and not very knowledgeable of the pvp assistance rules.  I had this little fear in the back of my head that I&#39;d turn my name red inadvertently.  I was surprised to see that at least some of my songs didn&#39;t help him...  I am positive that Hymn had no effect on him (all the tanks we&#39;re full health while he still was shy a bubble).  I think Selo&#39;s did work though because he (a druid) was able to keep pace with the group (and we all know how slow SoW is &lt;/e smiles proudly&gt;).  I didn&#39;t think to ask if Anthem or any of my other songs worked on him.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    My questions are, do any of our songs work on +pvp players?  <br/>
    Is anyone knowledgeable in the ways a -pvp can be turned +pvp from casting or is that just a nasty rumor?<br/>
