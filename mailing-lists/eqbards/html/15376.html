&gt; As you can see, the experience lost is linear, while the exp needed for hell<br/>

&gt; A death at 29 costs you half a bubble.<br/>
&gt; A death at 30 costs you a quarter of a bubble.<br/>

30.<br/>

Using your example, I was in 30, died, and lost a quarter<br/>
bubble (500 points).  I dinged into 31, then without gaining<br/>
any experience in the level I died again.  This time I lost<br/>
more than half a bubble (1000+ points).  Therefore, you lose<br/>
more experience in 31 than you do in 30.<br/>
<br/>
Same with 47.  I measured a 47 death applied entirely to<br/>
46.  I lost less than half what I would&#39;ve expected if I&#39;d<br/>
died in 46.  Therefore you lose less experience in 47 than you<br/>
do in 46.<br/>
<br/>
It is not a graphical effect - you really do lose more<br/>
experience in HL+1.<br/>
