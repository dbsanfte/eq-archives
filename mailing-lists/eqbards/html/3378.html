For 3-4 days I was trying to buy a Dirk for 25 plat, actually starting my<br/>
offers at 20.  I turned down 3-4 at 40 and one at 30.  Then a friend told<br/>
me it was no longer appearing at every death of the despicable D&#39;Vinn.  So<br/>
I figured I&#39;d have to go to at least 30.<br/>
<br/>
Running into Faydark from Butcherblock, where I&#39;d been to Kaladim with a<br/>
load of Crushbone belts and Legionnaire pads, I auctioned my now familiar,<br/>
&quot;Buying Dragoon Dirk.&quot;  Shortly I saw one auctioned with several unusual<br/>
items.  I responded immediately asking price.  The answer was 20 pp.  I<br/>
immediately responded &quot;Sold&quot; and asked where to meet the seller.  I<br/>
finished my cross-country shortcut to Kelethin and jumped on the path to<br/>
Felwithe.<br/>
<br/>
There I met a gorgeous, statuesqe, attractively armored Barbarian woman<br/>
(Erolissi herself in disguise?).  She sold me the Dirk and said she hoped<br/>
it was helpful here.  I only just realized how she might have been taken<br/>
for Erolissi in mortal form, or I would have made the complement then.  Ah,<br/>
what we think to say when it&#39;s too late.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I expect she was a tourist, in the big city from the far lands, and<br/>
unaware of the present price for Dirks.  I salved my twinge of guilt with<br/>
the consideration that she may well have obtained it herself from D&#39;Vinn&#39;s<br/>
properly lifeless corpse, or may have bought it at a bargain price and been<br/>
glad of her profit.  Or may have had little need for cash.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it was Erolissi herself, come to bless her servant.<br/>
