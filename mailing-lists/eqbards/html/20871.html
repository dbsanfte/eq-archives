<div id="ygrps-yiv-272825011">Have to agree.  Kind of depressing to see all these people say &quot;Well go see<br/>
if the group camping it will let you loot the mask&quot;  While I have no problem<br/>
with people doing it I strongly feel people should go camp the SoB<br/>
(especially when they&#39;re high enough to) and get it themselves.  A good<br/>
group at 36 can easily take that room.  I&#39;ve done it with a group of 30&#39;s.<br/>
