<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962027604">My guess, and it ties into the Burynai Bunt Cake quest that we haven&#39;t<br/>
figgered out yet, is that the helm that Treekill gives as the reward is the<br/>
Singing Steel Helm. His talk says that he got it from a bard, that the helm<br/>
is only usable by bards, and that the bard said it came from Sebilis where<br/>
all of the class helms are coming from that I know of.<br/>
	If the quest for the cake turns out to be quite elaborate and time<br/>
consuming then I can see Verant putting this as the reward.<br/>
<br/>
	But what would be the effect?<br/>
<br/>
	We are already getting air from our gloves...  (suck on my thumb to<br/>
breathe...)<br/>
<br/>
	We are already getting water from our boots... (Anyone for boot water?)<br/>
<br/>
	We are already getting food from our pants... (... not touching that<br/>
one... )<br/>
<br/>
	Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Singing Steel missing pieces<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so far the only pieces found are gloves, boots, and legs.  there is only one<br/>
set of legs (on any server) because we were able to kill venril sathir<br/>
before he was buffed incredibly (apparently he is a quest npc and not to be<br/>
killed), and now his loot table is most likely empty.  so we have gloves and<br/>
boots.  every other class with kunark armor has found one or all of the<br/>
following, and this includes druid, ranger, shadow knight, paladin, warrior,<br/>
rogue, shaman, cleric: arms, helm, bracer.  none of these have been found in<br/>
singing steel.  i refuse to believe they have not been found yet.  every<br/>
other class with armor in kunark has found these pieces!  maybe bards get<br/>
lucky and our pieces are so incredible they are found only in veeshan&#39;s peak<br/>
(laugh).  so what i think is that once again, like imbrued armor in hate,<br/>
bard armor has been forgotten to be placed in kunark.  anyone who is more<br/>
familiar and versed want to ask on the gameplay forum?  or am i wrong?<br/>
