<div id="ygrps-yiv-105586559">Just going from rough memory, I think I camped the room for a good 2 hours<br/>
before I got my guise (not mask - heh).  In that time we got place holders<br/>
and or nada loots from the named.  Something is on the 34 min cycle but it<br/>
wont always be the Assassin with a mask or dirk.<br/>

		Did they change the spawn on the assassin and supplier?<br/>
Last time I was<br/>
		there it was 34 minutes.  We had a stretch where we got 4<br/>
assassins (all<br/>
		with the mask :( ), and 5 suppliers ( all with the bag :( )<br/>
in a row...<br/>
		That was maybe 3 months ago, so maybe they changed the spawn<br/>
times in there<br/>
		since...</div>
