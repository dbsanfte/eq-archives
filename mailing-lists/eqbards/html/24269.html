&gt; &gt;or this question:  How many people have actually thought about the song and<br/>
&gt;possible <br/>
&gt; &gt;ways that it is useful?<br/>
&gt; &gt;30 seconds of &#39;&#39;cost&#39;&#39; time to get 400+ damage every 30 minutes or so seems<br/>
&gt;fairly <br/>
&gt; &gt;useful to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well I thought about it.  At best that 30 seconds will not gain you 400+<br/>
&gt;damage.  If you were using your chants during that 30 seconds, and counting<br/>
&gt;the best scenario where you lose 2 pulses of Frost, 3 pulses of Flame, and 4<br/>
&gt;pulses of Fulfill&#39;s you lose 350 damage from chants to gain 400 pts from<br/>
&gt;DDD.  Since you really lose the full 5 pulses of each Chant, some on the<br/>
&gt;back side while you restart them, you actually lose 600+ pts of damage in 30<br/>
&gt;seconds.  These numbers are just with a store bought drum.  If you have even<br/>
&gt;a Nostrolo&#39;s tambourine you lose even more potential damage.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the 30 seconds is during downtime, not during combat.  it also takes into account<br/>
the time it takes to mem the song, the time it takes to cast it (3 seconds), and the<br/>
time it takes to mem whatever song it replaced at the next downtime period.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Taking that into account DDD is worse than useless if you have to mem it<br/>

<br/>

DA spell or a druid&#39;s spirit of cheetah.</div>
