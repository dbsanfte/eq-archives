<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781470214">ok I know that you are mostly all way higher ups and stuff..but I have<br/>
just reached level 8 with my bard.  She is really a lot of fun but I<br/>
have a few questions.  First of all....what is the stats that bards<br/>
need to work on...(cha?  dex?  str?) I have concentrated on those 3<br/>
things and with ALL my stuff on my cha is 133 and my str is 99...not<br/>
sure my dex...please can someone advise me on that.  Next is that I<br/>
just got my lvl 8 song and I remember reading that it was such a useful<br/>
spell once..when i first got on the list and my bard was like lvl 3 and<br/>
i had no idea what anyone was talking about.  I have looked through<br/>
some archives but there is SOO much stuff...its difficult to locate. <br/>
Please can someone help me out here...between playing my druid in the<br/>
main I am really beginning to enjoy my bard if I can understand the<br/>
songs and use them to their full extent.  Thanks<br/>
