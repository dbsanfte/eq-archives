<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391583874">At 18 I had too many missed notes to solo effectively.<br/>
At 19 I soloed aviaks ... altho I did have some<br/>
trouble here and there because they do stun a lot.  I<br/>
also went to EF and soloed snow orc shaman and a few<br/>
mamouths.  sometimes you&#39;ll need to throw on selos and<br/>
bellow a few times to soften the mobs up a bit.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I was wearing banded and maybe some<br/>
bronze at the time.  Normal instruments as well.<br/>

&gt; times I tried it was death unless I could find a<br/>
&gt; blue &quot;oracle&quot; type caster.<br/>
&gt; No chains, No fear.  Sure DDD, and CoD do decent<br/>
&gt; damage but avoiding adds<br/>
&gt; was impossible nearly at that level range.  Now had<br/>
&gt; Lullaby been working I<br/>
&gt; imagine I could have pulled it off, but those levels<br/>
&gt; were horrific for me<br/>
&gt; because it was basically:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Log on, do /w friends all, /w armigers all.<br/>
&gt; If no one in my area, Log off and log on as<br/>
&gt; secondary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found that soloing those levels was nigh on<br/>
&gt; impossible, and grouping with<br/>
&gt; pickup groups was even more suicidal.  Invariably<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d die 3 or 4 times and<br/>
&gt; end up barely breaking even for the evening. <br/>
&gt; Biggest problem for me at<br/>
&gt; those levels was that if anyone in the group screwed<br/>
&gt; up, the instant result<br/>
&gt; was 1 dead bard.  Didn&#39;t matter what the screwup<br/>
&gt; was, bad pull, out of<br/>
&gt; control pet, linkdead tank, etc. End result was 1<br/>
&gt; dead bard and possibly 1<br/>
&gt; or 2 other deaths.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soloing at 27+ has been possible, even fairly<br/>
&gt; comfortable, but that long<br/>
&gt; stretch from 18th to 23rd was painful.<br/>

&gt; Grouping?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; First of all, it&#39;s bad players, not bad classes. <br/>
&gt; Period.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; YUP!!!  Agreed 100%<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you take a Bard who&#39;s soloed his way to 50<br/>
&gt; (/laugh), I&#39;d be willing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bet he&#39;s not a very good group player.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually the Bard is the 2nd or 3rd best Solo Class.<br/>
&gt;  Especially after level<br/>
&gt; 26 and 27.  And even before that you can easily solo<br/>
&gt; any blue with a well<br/>
&gt; played bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, Mage&#39;s, Necro&#39;s, Druids<br/>
&gt; &gt; all have a slight disadvantage in that they can<br/>
&gt; solo, so they might<br/>
&gt; &gt; not pick up the group acceptable behaviors along<br/>
&gt; the way, while Bards<br/>
&gt; &gt; are generally forced to group and thus forced to<br/>
&gt; figure out HOW to<br/>
&gt; &gt; group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See above.  Bards are, hands down, one of THE best<br/>
&gt; solo classes in the game.<br/>
&gt; We are also one of the best GROUP classes.  My bard<br/>
&gt; can out-solo a magician<br/>
&gt; any day of the week until a magician hits level 40<br/>
&gt; or so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your points are valid regarding players who solo<br/>
&gt; rather than group.  However<br/>
&gt; I dissagree that casters have a harder time learning<br/>
&gt; to solo.  Bards are<br/>
&gt; easily as powerful (and in many cases far more<br/>
&gt; powerful) as any caster at<br/>
&gt; Solo play except perhaps the Necromancer and Druid<br/>
&gt; classes yet we learn to<br/>
&gt; operate in groups just fine.  Many people, even<br/>
&gt; bards, don&#39;t realize just<br/>
&gt; how powerful we are as a Solo class.   Even Druids<br/>
&gt; and Necros have a hard<br/>
&gt; time soloing hill giants.  Yet a bard can do it<br/>
&gt; easily enough starting at<br/>
&gt; around level 30 if we have 2 giants.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree completely that it&#39;s the player, not the<br/>
&gt; class, that makes ANY<br/>
&gt; character good, or bad, in a group.  I have grouped<br/>
&gt; with good magicians, bad<br/>
&gt; magicians and the whole range in between.  Same goes<br/>
&gt; for EVERY other class<br/>
&gt; in the game, including bards.  In fact, I&#39;d honestly<br/>
&gt; say, I&#39;ve met more bad<br/>
&gt; bard players than any other class barring Necros. <br/>
&gt; (And they DO have a<br/>
&gt; harder time learning to group because nobody wants a<br/>
&gt; necro -until recently-)<br/>
