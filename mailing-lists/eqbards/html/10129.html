&gt; At 32nd with maxed 1HB and maxed 1HS, a Staff of Writhing and a Silvery War<br/>
&gt; Axe I can kill a light blue if nothing abnormal happens and he&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt; caster.  Taking on a blue or deep blue would be tantamount to suicide, at<br/>
&gt; best very, very risky.  For me a solid blue mob would be a Lizard Fanatic in<br/>
&gt; Cazic-Thule.  It would pound me into the mud one-on-one.  No question.  On<br/>
&gt; the other hand, a light blue would be a gator in the sewers.  I *can* solo<br/>
&gt; one of those.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just for yucks, I decided to try soloing a greater kobold in<br/>
Sol B (usually L35 or so) at level 40.  I played Hymn,<br/>
Warsong, Psalm of Cooling, and Chain, trying as hard as I<br/>
could to keep all 4 effects going (probably succeeded about<br/>
half the time).  When I dropped below half health, I switched<br/>
to Pixie Strike/Hymn with a lute while I healed up.  I did<br/>
this right in front of a little-used zone line for reasons of<br/>
safety.<br/>
<br/>
It started off pretty well.  I amazed myself by dropping it<br/>
about 20% (one bubble) while only taking one bubble of damage<br/>
myself.  Then it got several quick hits in dropping me below<br/>
half, and I switched to heal up while it was down 30%.<br/>
<br/>
Next round didn&#39;t go very well.  It got some big hits on me<br/>
and I was down 3 bubbles before I barely budged its hp - maybe<br/>
10%, leaving it down about 35% (it healed too while I was<br/>
healing).<br/>
<br/>
The next two rounds were about average - I chipped off about<br/>
20% of its hp before it could drop me to below half.  So after<br/>
four rounds, the kobold was down 70% or so.<br/>
<br/>
The fifth round had a close call as another kobold spawned in<br/>
the room (I was in the hall).  Fortunately, it was just out of<br/>
aggro range and didn&#39;t join.  Another player watched me for a<br/>
bit, then pulled the new kobold.  I was smelling blood by the<br/>
end of this round with the kobold down to about 15% of its hp.<br/>
<br/>
The sixth round I almost killed it, getting it down to just a<br/>
sliver of hp, maybe 5%, while I was at half.  I decided to<br/>
commit to killing it this round, since the zone was just<br/>
behind me.  I was starting to regret my decision when it got<br/>
several lucky hits on me leaving me with little more than a<br/>
bubble, when the other player returned and tossed a couple<br/>
heals on me.  The kobold started to run once I was healed, and<br/>
after 20 minutes fighting the same kobold, I got to loot my<br/>
kill.  Final score:  me - about 6 bubbles damage, kobold -<br/>
about 17 bubbles of damage.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, you can solo, but you probably don&#39;t want to.  It&#39;s<br/>
much easier to group or charm (I suppose charm could be<br/>
considered soloing, but killing off the winner solo can be a<br/>
pain too).<br/>
