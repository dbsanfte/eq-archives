&gt;Has there been anything difinative(said by the bard programmer) about a <br/>
&gt;bards agility stat being used to check if the bard has succesfully used his <br/>
&gt;dodge skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In other words is it worth while for bards to raise their agility so they <br/>
&gt;dodge more often?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, our programmer is no longer on the list, however, it is my<br/>
firm belief that Agility has nothing to do with the Dodge skill - it is<br/>
based completely on the skill alone.<br/>
