<b>Subject:</b> Re: Macro setup for bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438527170">I found no way around having two or three banks of hotkeys per character.  For<br/>
my Bard I have a similar bank of hotkeys that allows me to access my melee slots<br/>
and three inventory slots (one of those is occupied by a backpack to allow<br/>
access to all instruments) the sixth slot has a &quot;Run Away!&quot; text key.    That is<br/>
the bank of keys I use most of the time now, but my other bank of keys has sense<br/>
heading, forage, /assist, /loc,  /corpse, and a &quot;Run Away!&quot; key.  It is easy to<br/>
switch between them (shift and numbers one through six), but I rarely find it<br/>
necessary to switch in critical situations.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The recent discussion on the use of the /assist command has got me wondering<br/>
&gt; how other bards setup their macros.  For myself, up to this point I have<br/>
&gt; only used one bank (6 hot-keys) of macros.  I have not setup the other five<br/>
&gt; banks.  If I have confused anyone, I use the term bank to refer to the six<br/>
&gt; buttons you can hotkey in the lower left hand portion of your screen.  You<br/>
&gt; can hit Shift-# to switch banks or you can use your mouse to cycle through<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For my first bank, I have two inventory slots and two melee slots macroed so<br/>
&gt; I quickly switch from weapon/shield to an instrument if the situation calls<br/>
&gt; for it.  I have hot-keyed Sense Heading and Foraging to take up the other<br/>
&gt; two slots.  I hotkeyed Sense Heading so when I am fleeing I dont have to<br/>
&gt; worry about switching macro banks.  I have Foraging hotkeyed so I can<br/>
&gt; continually click on it in between combats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t worried about macroing songs because I can click on them with my<br/>
&gt; mouse just as easy as hitting the hotkey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m beginning to think that I should place /assist on my main macro bank but<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like the idea of moving Sense Heading or Forage to another bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How does everyone else have their hotkeys setup?<br/>
