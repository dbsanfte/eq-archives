<div id="ygrps-yiv-484744408">You can ask, but they won&#39;t change it.  In fact I don&#39;t think it should be<br/>
changed.  A lot of the bard songs are tweaked with some slight drawback over<br/>
the caster&#39;s version of the same thing, and this is the way it needs to be.<br/>
We can wait until everyone is called &quot;oom&quot; before we hit MMM and have a<br/>
mana-less evac.  This advantage (not using mana) is really quite powerful and<br/>
simply must be offset slightly in some way.<br/>

&gt; Thanks John.  Since I&#39;m gonna try my hat at soloing for a while, think I<br/>
&gt; might start having this song memorized.  Its too bad that it won&#39;t teleport<br/>
&gt; the entire party to the same random location.  Do you guys think this is<br/>
&gt; something that we should ask Verant to consider changing somewhere down the<br/>
&gt; road?  Since it would help the entire party, and doesn&#39;t impact solo play at<br/>
&gt; all, it shouldn&#39;t be a class balance issue.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  of the village.  Since I won&#39;t get levitate for a long time, was<br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I sing that song<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; while at the top of the village (or any high altitude location), will I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appear at the same altitude over the ground, and as a result take lots<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage due to falling?  Or will I end up on the ground wherever the song<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sends me to?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Comments: Teleports you and your party members a random distance in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; random direction.  The distance seems to be dependent on level and whether<br/>
&gt; &gt; or not you&#39;re using a wind instrument.  It might&#39;ve been marginally useful<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; different random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or<br/>
&gt; &gt; closed doors.  It will place you at ground level.<br/>
