<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833158516">i am skeptical too about imbrued.  i know all the armor drops in both planes<br/>
were made much more rare, but at least we have seen pieces of it all dropped<br/>
since then.  i have yet to see imbrued.<br/>
<br/>
the ykesha/rapier is a toss-up for me.  ykesha has the proc, rapier has 1<br/>
better delay (negligible, but its there) and nice 5str 4gi stats.  since if<br/>
i did use a ykesha it would be in my secondary hand only and since it will<br/>
proc less there, i am using the rapier for the stats.  and i like wielding 2<br/>
PoH weps =)  when i got my rapier and lute i was lucky enough to be the only<br/>
bard there.  when i got the six note blade, i was lucky enough to win a<br/>
50/50 lotto.<br/>

&gt; won&#39;t believe it <br/>
&gt; til I see it. Not too interested in the rapier either - if I <br/>
&gt; were to get one <br/>
&gt; and we killed Mr. Maestro that would knock me out of lottoing <br/>
&gt; rights on his <br/>
&gt; loots. =) Either way I won&#39;t give up a Yak for a rapier.<br/>
