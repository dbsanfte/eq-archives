<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764292354">I really disagree with that.  Granted I am &quot;only&quot; 48, but I keep waiting<br/>
(and now I will never reach it) for this time when I will not be able to<br/>
hold up my end in a group (I&#39;ve been hearing it said since I started playing<br/>
my bard).<br/>
<br/>
I almost never had problems getting a group, I&#39;d say bards have it third<br/>
easiest (behind clerics and enchanters).  On Veeshan (at least) if you a<br/>
good bard, word gets around quickly.  When I told a friend of mine I was<br/>
retiring, he let the Vox raid (which was getting ready) about it. I got more<br/>
tells than I could reply to asking me not to quit.  (Anything from &quot;Doh,<br/>
why?&quot; to &quot;Dammit now who are we going to get to die on plane runs?&quot; There<br/>
are some advantages to be a very rarely played class.<br/>
<br/>
What do you bring as a bard:<br/>
Downtime reduction.  I think bards are probably the kings of this.  Maybe<br/>
enchanters because of their greater crowd control. (which translates into<br/>
less wasted mana/health)<br/>
<br/>
Crowd Control:  Charm is still better than what everyone but enchanters (and<br/>
maybe necros) get.  I can usually charm one mob, and have him attack mob 3,<br/>
thus essentially taking 2 mobs out of the fight for 90% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
DOT&#39;s:  Triple chants with your Nostrolo Tamborine/Naggy Drum is a LOT of<br/>
damage.  If you&#39;re in a low damage output group, this can be a big help.<br/>
<br/>
Healing:  With only 2 heal songs, my ability to keep people healtyh was<br/>
pretty impressive.  I had a all melle hybrid group in Karnor&#39;s.  I sung the<br/>
2 regen songs (w mandolin) and Beserker (w/ Vox Horn).  With one paladin, we<br/>
stayed together for about 2 hours, and everyone was happy with their xp and<br/>
how much FUN it was to make fun of casters.  (FYI, we had warrior, ranger,<br/>
paladin, rogue, monk and me.  Monk pulled, Ranger tagged and parked extras.<br/>
Warrior and Pally would taunt smartly, keeping the damage balanced among all<br/>
SIX of us)<br/>
<br/>
Resists:  For big raids, the organizers only seem to worry about how many<br/>
bards and how many clerics we have.  I dont think any class is easier to get<br/>
invited onto big raids with than bard (since there are like 3 times as many<br/>
high lvl clerics as bards).  Most commonly heard thing on a dragon run,<br/>
&quot;Woohoo, we got a bard, we will all live!!!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Problem solver:  Being 2nd or 3rd best at everything has its moments:<br/>
People go linkdead.  Real life makes people log without any warning.  If you<br/>
have a bard in your party your chance of having to disband/sit their with<br/>
your tumb up your butt waiting when something happens is much lower.<br/>
Getting xp/loot half as fast is better than getting none.<br/>
<br/>
Mana Pump:  In a caster heavy group?  Give your tired fingers a rest (well<br/>
till you get the other mana songs), pull out your crappy weapons, and swing<br/>
away while your melodies give the other 5 members of your group a 35% (is<br/>
that the boost?) increase in their ability.<br/>
<br/>
Fear/Snaring:  Got a snarer?  Fine, who cares whats in your group?  Go<br/>
outside and fear snare.  The ranger and I got 5 Wurmslayers for our guild<br/>
doing this.  Not to mention xp which was at least as good as what I normally<br/>
would get grouped in Karnors.   We also got lots of cool stuff for the guild<br/>
doing the same in Frontier Mts (mostly wis caster stuff, we were trying to<br/>
get me those cool sleeves).<br/>
<br/>
Track:  Oh yea, we can track...<br/>
<br/>
Solo:  We are on of the best soloing chars in the game.  Granted I hate<br/>
soloing, but I was able to solo for reasonable xp at lvl 45.  Not many<br/>
people can do that.<br/>
<br/>
Fun and Variety:  How many classes have as many options available to them as<br/>
we do?  I would say none.<br/>
<br/>
A bards role is different then anyone else&#39;s in Norrath, because it is not<br/>
written in stone.  Pretty much every other class can only do one or two<br/>
things.  This makes bards have ahigher learning curve then other classes.<br/>
However a well played bard is definitly a wanted commodity (at least on<br/>
Veeshan)<br/>
