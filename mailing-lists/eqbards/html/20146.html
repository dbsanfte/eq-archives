<br/>
I agree that it was fine in early final release.  I just can&#39;t see why they<br/>
don&#39;t return it to that state.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the enchanter an warrior I saw were doing exactly as you described.<br/>
Due to the enchanter&#39;s ability to AoE mez, and chain stun which is often<br/>
overlooked, they were taking down the mobs one at a time with very little<br/>
damage taken by the warrior.  The warrior was complaining he wasn&#39;t getting<br/>
hurt enough to use bind wounds.  Granted they were taking down blues and not<br/>
whites or yellows, but it still seemed just as powerful a tactic as what you<br/>
described with two bards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Try to be a little less negative, bud, it comes off really harsh and makes<br/>
&gt;you sound like you hate EQ and bards in specific.  Seriously, if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want to do crowd control why the hell do you care if Lullaby works at all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to do just crowd control.  I like the bard class because we can<br/>
do so many different things that I don&#39;t get bored by doing the same old<br/>
thing every night.  That&#39;s probably why I don&#39;t like grouping with<br/>
enchanters, it takes away almost all of my tactical options.  With<br/>
enchanters I feel like I get pigeon holed into one single role, and it isn&#39;t<br/>
one I feel bards are best suited to.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I really like bards and EQ in general.  It&#39;s just that some things<br/>
really tick me off.  I work in software development and support and Verant&#39;s<br/>
approach to support is a really big sticking point with me.  They are<br/>
unprofessional, incompetent, and unresponsive in that area.  I&#39;ve worked<br/>
that area in three wholly different industries and in any of them the people<br/>
that developed and implemented Verant&#39;s approach would be unemployed by now.<br/>
I have frankly never met more than a handful of programmers who were half as<br/>
arrogant as Verant&#39;s come off being.  To have a different version of the<br/>
&quot;Live&quot; client on your testing machine is unbelieveable, yet that&#39;s exactly<br/>
why GZ was so astounded that there was no message for the secondary resist.<br/>
<br/>
What really perplexes me more than anything.  How did a company that had the<br/>
vision to come up with something like EQ, and do so well in so many places<br/>
with it, suddenly become so completely incapable of changing it without<br/>
breaking things so often?<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing.  I was reading a book on game software design and support and I<br/>
came accross a passage where Brad McQuaid is quoted supporting the concept<br/>
of extensive testing.  I haven&#39;t laughed so loud in a long time.  It&#39;s<br/>
funny, they obviously see some parts of testing as being necessary.  After<br/>
all, we have people like you to thank for not having to fall through holes<br/>
in the geography every 30 minutes.  I just can&#39;t figure out how they can<br/>
claim to test bard changes, when so many of the changes fail the simplest<br/>
test.  We aren;t talking about obscure interelationships between seldom used<br/>
spells here, we&#39;re talking about songs that are meant to damage an opponent<br/>
but only work on the singer(The three DoT&#39;s), or damage spells that<br/>
heal(Brusco&#39;s II), or songs that do absolutely nothing (Alenia&#39;s).  There<br/>
are more such examples.<br/>
<br/>
My mood often mirrors these changes.  Verant tries to nerf the 54th level<br/>
movement redux and claims to only change that one song.  In reality they<br/>
reduced Chains as well, down to the secondary effect of a necro spell.<br/>
That&#39;s either incompetent or they out and out lied.  I don&#39;t like being lied<br/>
too, it makes my cranky.<br/>

&gt; An enchanter and any melee class can derail a large train of blues and<br/>
&gt; slaughter them one by one.  They face the same level of risk as two bards<br/>
&gt; trying this.  It was not overly powerful.  Without being able to use other<br/>
