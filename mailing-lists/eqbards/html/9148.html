<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481371249">So what you are saying is that if you target a mob standing right next to<br/>
you and sing this song, you will also take damage.  What happens if you<br/>
target a mob from a distance but the rest of your party is standing near the<br/>
mob? Will they also take damage? <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This song is a Rain type spell. Hence the green icon. This means you need<br/>
&gt; to stand far off from<br/>
&gt; your target, and then hit them with the song to avoid getting hit<br/>
&gt; yourself. The song will then<br/>
&gt; hit any mobs surrounding your target. It does up to 325 dmg to each<br/>
&gt; target. It can hit up to 4<br/>
&gt; targets I believe. It may not do max dmg most of the time, but it isnt<br/>
&gt; resisted too often.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am just about to recieve my level 43 song (Desperate<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dirge) and had a few questions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) Can this song still damage the singer?  or has this<br/>
&gt; &gt; been fixed?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) Is the song a true area effect?  or do you need to<br/>
&gt; &gt; target a single critter?  or can you target yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get AoE around you?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3) How many critters can the song affect?  what type<br/>
&gt; &gt; of damage is typical?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4) Is this song resisted more, less, the same as other<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Along with these questions please add anything else<br/>
&gt; &gt; you would like to say about the song.  I usually test<br/>
&gt; &gt; out the songs myself, but seeing how it has such a<br/>
&gt; &gt; LONG reload time that may prove to be difficult.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>
