<div id="ygrps-yiv-251975249">For the sake of argument, lets assume that binding in non-cities is #1 on<br/>
the wishlist of melee/hybrid classes.  If it isn&#39;t #1, then it is very high<br/>
on the list based on the uproar that arises everytime the issue is raised.<br/>
Lets also assume that Brad McQuaid was telling the truth that EQ will<br/>
continue to evolve as the game matures.  Lets also assume that some of the<br/>
future changes that Verant will  make is based on feedback from their<br/>
customers.  <br/>
<br/>
With these assumptions, IMO, it is not a waste of time to discuss the issue<br/>
of binding of melee/hybrid classes in non-cities (or giving hybrid classes<br/>
the ability to cast bind affinity).  Just because Verant decided on the<br/>
current binding policy in beta doesn&#39;t mean that they will never change<br/>
their mind.  Case in point: Origin recently stated new areas will be added<br/>
to UO that will be non-PVP. This is 180% to their long standing policy of UO<br/>
being 100% PVP (I read the UO infobit at Desslock&#39;s website).  Intelligent<br/>
debate of any issue, in EQ or RL, IMO is always a good thing.  Both sides,<br/>
if they are willing to listen and learn, both come out of the debate with a<br/>
better understanding of the issue involved.  Only those people who are<br/>
unwilling to listen or change their views come out with nothing.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who say Verant will never budge on their binding policy, I<br/>
honestly don&#39;t understand how you know that to be etched in stone.  The odds<br/>
may indicate that they will never change the policy, but there is always a<br/>
chance that they could change their minds.  For me personally, I don&#39;t like<br/>
the current policy and hope they make a change sometime in the future.  As<br/>
long as there is a chance that this may occur, I think that it is a<br/>
legitimate topic for discussion.  With that said, of all the EQ forums out<br/>
there, this list may be the one best suited to come up with a new binding<br/>
policy that makes everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
One last question for those of you who are opposed to changing the binding<br/>
policy.  Lets assume that someone creates a petition on this issue that is<br/>
well thought out and makes logical sense.  If any petition on binding has a<br/>
chance of getting approved, this one is it.  If you agree with me that there<br/>
is a possibility, however small, that Verant will change their minds on the<br/>
binding issue, would you vote in favor or against the petition?  Remember<br/>
that if the petition is disapproved, the policy remains the same, the way<br/>
you think it should be.  But if the petition is approved and the binding<br/>
policy is changed, a LOT of people will be happy plus you will also benefit<br/>
from the change.  IMO, if you vote Yes for the petition its a win-win<br/>
situation for you.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Despite what people seem to think at times, Verant has three years of 25<br/>
&gt; or so<br/>
&gt; people having worked on this game.  Somewhere there is a Master Design<br/>
&gt; Document that is probably around 1,000 pages long.  If you believe that<br/>
&gt; decisions like player binding weren&#39;t discussed for litterally hundreds of<br/>
&gt; man-hours you&#39;re sorely mistaken and have no idea how much effort and time<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; gone into this game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NPCs will never be given the ability to bind.  This would kill &quot;Binding<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; donations at gates&quot;, and the sale of binds.  Verant does not want to do<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; (In fact in the Policies and Procedures manual for Guides it forbids<br/>
&gt; Guides<br/>
&gt; from binding players because it would &#39;damage the economy of players<br/>
&gt; selling<br/>
&gt; binds&#39;).  NPCs binding would lower caster&#39;s value to the non-casters in<br/>
&gt; Norrath and eliminate a point of player interaction, Verant doesn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; either.  I&#39;ve got a 14th level Enchanter and I bind for free all the time<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; though I could use the cash.  Why?  Because I like that feeling I get when<br/>
&gt; some 10th level player say &quot;Hey, thanks a lot!!&quot; when I turn down his 2gp<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s trying to donate.  NPCs binding would eliminate that four thousands<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; players.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bind anywhere?  Never happen.  In fact, I think the casters are probably<br/>
&gt; lucky<br/>
&gt; to have gotten that ability, as it&#39;s potentially quite unbalancing when<br/>
&gt; fighting uber-mobs like dragons.  &quot;Yeah, I lost a level dying 14 times<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; fighting Vox, but I would just spawn, mem my spells and nuke until I got<br/>
&gt; killed.&quot;  This is precicely why Ressurection effects have been made so<br/>
&gt; horrendous.  Probably casters being able to bind anywhere was to offset<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; fragile they are should the group get overrun by mobs.  The casters are<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; least likely to make it to the zone alive in a bad situation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying; it&#39;s a very<br/>
&gt; important part of the game.  Many people make the &quot;game fun&quot; or the &quot;I can<br/>
&gt; only play two hours a week&quot; argument, but when you consider the impact<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; binding anywhere would have on group dynamics and strategy, you quickly<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; that it works best the way that it is.  Verant has decided that getting to<br/>
&gt; your corpse, in addition to the experience lost is what that penalty is.<br/>
&gt; When<br/>
&gt; there is a penalty for dying you coordinate your actions and fight with<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; strategy.  Verant (and I) want this VERY much.  Conversely, if there were<br/>
&gt; little or no penalty for dying, sloppy unbalanced groups would just go<br/>
&gt; into a<br/>
&gt; place like Mistmoore with little or no regard of how the zone works.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;d<br/>
&gt; just pull the castle and beat on stuff until everything was dead with the<br/>
&gt; minor annoyance of having to loot their corpses.  I wouldn&#39;t be addicted<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; that game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have never had the problems that you describe getting a bind.  Getting<br/>
&gt; bound<br/>
&gt; in Erudin can be tough, as that continent is currently underutilized.<br/>
&gt; There<br/>
&gt; are only two types out there now.  Newbie Erudite players that are trying<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; get up to level 4 or 6 or so before going to Qeynos where the real action<br/>
&gt; is,<br/>
&gt; and higher level Druid types running out to Kerra Isle for a questing<br/>
&gt; reason<br/>
&gt; that I won&#39;t disclose here.  However, since nothing is really going on out<br/>
&gt; there I never really need a bind out there.  Paineel is due to open in the<br/>
&gt; next few weeks.  It is a higher level zone built off of Tox Forrest.<br/>
&gt; Erudin<br/>
&gt; is likely to get a lot busier soon, and when it does Kerra Isle will also<br/>
&gt; probably start being used for its intended purpose (a teens level zone)<br/>
&gt; instead of just having 6 high level druids in it.  I would personally<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; sit for two hours waiting for a bind.  I&#39;d continue to solicit binds if<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t show up within five or ten minutes.  11pm Mountain?  I routinely<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; until 3am Central and I never have problems getting binds in the major<br/>
&gt; cities.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually I am more sick of hearing we won&#39;t get bind.  You are right it<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t happen until people start leaving EQ in droves because they are<br/>
&gt; either<br/>
&gt; &gt; A, a melee class that is sick of running to their bodies on Kunark from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport, or B, they are a caster who is sick of constantly dying<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the tanks have either quit or are an hour away in Freeport because<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lizard race is evil and they can&#39;t bind there.  Verant needs to realize<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; bind is not a class balance issue it is a game fun issue.  I frankly<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t care if we got bind if either everyone could be bound<br/>
&gt; everywhere by<br/>
&gt; &gt; a caster, and or there were npc&#39;s to bind you in cities.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have quit playing 5 times in the last 2 weeks because I found myself<br/>
&gt; in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; city waiting for over an hour trying to get bound.  Adventuring on<br/>
&gt; faydwyr<br/>
&gt; &gt; while bound in Freeport is pointless, as is adventuring on erud while<br/>
&gt; bound<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Qeynos.  I have never been able to get bound on Erud unless I brought<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; own binder with me.  I have sat in Kaladim for 2 hours waiting to get<br/>
&gt; bound<br/>
&gt; &gt; after having been sent tells by three different casters in Butcherblock<br/>
&gt; &gt; saying hold on they would come bind me.  None of them showed and they<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; all on my ignore list now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The only 3 places I have been able to bind in regularly are Freeport,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Qeynos, and Rivervale and even in those places its nigh on impossible<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; 11pm mst.  I hae been bound in Halas for over a week without being able<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get a bind after trying in Kaladim, Freeport and Rivervale.  last nite,<br/>
&gt; &gt; after 13 hours of play over the last  week I was able to get bound in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rivervale.  For those of us who can&#39;t play in prime time and don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; regular group that gets online together on a consistent basis, binding<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; currently a ridiculous situation.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We are not getting bind.  We will never get bind and we have less need<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; bind than any other class, considering the rate at which we run.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Talies, please KABONG this before this whole arguement starts up yet<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think most people are sick of hearing it by now<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is a posting that was on alt.games.everquest that I think is<br/>
&gt; &gt; logical and something that may be considered for a petition.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is a suggestion for a bardic form of Bind Affinity. Bards are<br/>
&gt; amongst<br/>
&gt; &gt; Norath&#39;s primary travellers, so it seems a little odd that, somewhere<br/>
&gt; &gt; amongst the song set, there is no bind song.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In an effort to avoid the &quot;Give us bind&quot; syndrome, I have applied some<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought. If you are already thinking &quot;No way, bind for casters only&quot;,<br/>
&gt; please<br/>
&gt; &gt; read on - you might actually be pleasantly surprised.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The great Songmistress Alenia discovered a song, sung by a bard in South<br/>
&gt; &gt; Karana, which strangely and uniquely affected her. She aquired the<br/>
&gt; &gt; instructions for the singing of the song, and returned with it to<br/>
&gt; Freeport,<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking nothing further of it until her arrival.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; During her travel, she was accosted by a creature which, when she came<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; loot it, produced a lump of ore. She placed this in her backpack, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; continued to freeport.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The following morning, she dug out her notes, and decided to rehearse<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; new song, before bringing it before her guildmaster for review. As she<br/>
&gt; sang,<br/>
&gt; &gt; she noticed that the strange sensation she had experienced previously<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; lacking, infact, she was most of the way through the song before that<br/>
&gt; &gt; sensation returned. Then the unexpected happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The lump of ore, which she had not yet sold, began to resonate with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; chords and notes. Her mind was filled with a passion for the rocks and<br/>
&gt; &gt; stones, the earth and grass that had been hewn, cut, shaped and grown<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; the town of Freeport. Her soul filled with a passion for Freeport, and<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; realised she had bonded with Freeport.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Feeling suddenly drained, she ceased the song and sat. She had<br/>
&gt; discovered<br/>
&gt; &gt; it! She recognised the drained sensation from tales her mother had told<br/>
&gt; her,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and with a clap of joy she cried out &quot;Mana!&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; --- The practical explanation ---<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bard&#39;s Bind would have a lengthy casting time instead of the usual<br/>
&gt; &quot;3.0&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And it would use mana, and a component (a piece of ore, or maybe some<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; item which would fuel a bit of economy).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The mana would be, say, 200 units. However; bard&#39;s bind would ALSO be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; group effect, requiring, say, 100 or 150 units of mana per extra person<br/>
&gt; &gt; bound. During the bind, each of the targets must be seated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That means: Bard sings bind, 1 member of party (within radius) is not<br/>
&gt; &gt; sitting for the entire casting duration, bind fails.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If the bard is grouped with, say, 4 people, he would need 200 + 4 x 100<br/>
&gt; =<br/>
&gt; &gt; 600 units of mana.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The numbers might need juggling so that a bard can bind a full party of<br/>
&gt; 6 by<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 30.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would suggest that the song be implemented as level 20 or 21, and that<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs be shuffled so that it effectively replaces the level 14 song (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cataloging libretto).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Implementing level 21 makes most sense, since you could then move<br/>
&gt; Melanie&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Melifluous motion down to level 14.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t, however, think that we bards should get bind early (e.g. level<br/>
&gt; 14).<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think prior to that point, making sure you can get bound is a good<br/>
&gt; &gt; encouragement for people to learn to *play* their character *as* a bard,<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; socialise and such.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; My Comments:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow, I have to say that you really did think that out.  I like the fact<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; you have couples the song with mana and with a reagent.  I go back and<br/>
&gt; forth<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the group based bind.  One one hand, it would provide the melee<br/>
&gt; classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a way to avoid a 5 zone run back to their body, on the other hand<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; would probally cause an influx of people playing bards just to get that<br/>
&gt; &gt; ability.  On the plus side, the bard would be even more important to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; group.  I think by giving this abilitiy later in life, at say 21 as you<br/>
&gt; say<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a great idea.  Its far enough in that the casual player wont play for<br/>
&gt; 21<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels if they really dont like it. But not too far that its out of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; range of the committed bard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One addendum to that idea of yours, would be to put a singing<br/>
&gt; restriction on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bard bind similar or greater to the paladin lay of hands.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If a restriction like that was put on it, I would have NO problem with<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; being group based bind.  In addition you might make getting the song be<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard involved quest that someone who is 21 could do solo, but would take<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, to summarize:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Song: Bardic Binding Bellow<br/>
&gt; &gt; Level: 21<br/>
&gt; &gt; Casting Req&#39;s:  Mana, 200 (Self) + 100 Per group member, 800 Mana for<br/>
&gt; full<br/>
&gt; &gt; group + Reagent (Enchanted electrum or something like that),<br/>
&gt; &gt; ore, etc. Possibly make a Zone Specific Reagent<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Stipulations: Can only be sung once per day, similar to Lay of Hands<br/>
&gt; &gt; Acquired: By multi-part quest, forcing the bard to travel to many zones<br/>
&gt; &gt; (thus preventing us from becoming Bind whores)<br/>
&gt; &gt;                Possible addendum to this.. make two spells.. the first<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; &gt;                a Self-Only Bind that is bought at a merchant.  Still<br/>
&gt; &gt;                would use reagents, but would not have a casting<br/>
&gt; restriction.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                The Second Bind spell would be a Quest.  It would be<br/>
&gt; group<br/>
&gt; &gt;                bind, but would difficult AND have a casting delay built<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt;                like lay of Hands, etc.  If you did it this way, you<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt;                even make the delay greater, say 2 days.  This would<br/>
&gt; enable<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;                bard to be able to self-bind at any time, but only group<br/>
&gt; bind<br/>
&gt; &gt;                on a limited basis.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think this is an excellent idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
