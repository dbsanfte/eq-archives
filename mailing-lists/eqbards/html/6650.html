<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621270043"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One last thing,  before EQ came out,  I averaged buying about 10 computer<br/>
&gt; games a year.  A lot of them I would not even finish because I got bored<br/>
&gt; with them.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since April and I am still having lots of<br/>
&gt; fun playing.  As a 22d level bard, I still have alot of things I can look<br/>
&gt; forward to doing in the game.  I haven&#39;t even considered buying a new game<br/>
&gt; since April. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Well put !!!! I was just telling my wife how much money she save<br/>
because I have not brought the 3 or 4 games a month that I used to ! <br/>
Now I may but Diablo 2 but EQ I play every day and the one game I<br/>
brought since EQ (TA Kingdoms) I haven&#39;t bothered to finish. But I will<br/>
collect pop bottles on the side of the road to get the EQ Expansion pack<br/>
:) You can&#39;t beat playing with real folk :)<br/>
