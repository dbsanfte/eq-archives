<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005422070"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;As for turning PvP that&#39;s a bunch of nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe, looong ago, that was going to be the original mechanism. Least I<br/>
remember reading about it when first looking in to EQ. If you aided a +PvP<br/>
character you went +PvP. I think they probably decided that was going to be<br/>
a MESS and changed it.<br/>
