<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-387919531">I have a couple questions about UGuk:<br/>
<br/>
I went in there with some friends of mine (me-L24 bard, L21 mage, L29 druid,<br/>
L26 druid), and we&#39;d none of us been in there before, so the froggies were<br/>
not aggro to any of us. While we were there, we met someone who said he&#39;s<br/>
show us where this particular creature spawned (mage was wanting to complete<br/>
a part of her quest and it had an item she needed). Anyway, this person was<br/>
KOS to most things inside as he&#39;d been hunting in there for a while. One of<br/>
our druids was going to cast invis/see invis on him (and see invis on the<br/>
rest of us) when he&#39;s attacked by something, and one of our druids casts see<br/>
invis on him exactly the same time. Then the creatures started attacking us!<br/>
<br/>
So: Did they attack us because one of the druids cast see invis on him while<br/>
he was defending himself??? Our 21mage stayed back and didn&#39;t do anything<br/>
while we helped our &quot;guide&quot; defend himself but the 29druid, and myself DID<br/>
help (actually, I had to defend myself, because, when they turned to attack,<br/>
they attacked me and the 29druid). The 26 druid also helped by joining in<br/>
the fight, yet her faction didn&#39;t seem to be affected (i.e. she can stand in<br/>
there uninvised and not be attacked). And, the mage&#39;s faction took no hits<br/>
whatsoever. Anyway, anyone have any ideas what was going on with this? Oddly<br/>
enough, when I am standing there, they are just dubious to me, and when I<br/>
sing the invis song, they are indifferent to me, so it seems my faction<br/>
wasn&#39;t adjusted THAT much.</div>
