&gt;None of the Frogloks (Warriors, Knights, Shamen) I&#39;ve killed in SoNH have<br/>
&gt;ever dropped Mesh or any other type of armour.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In fact, come to think of it, loot in the Swamp is pretty measly.<br/>
&gt;Experience is good, however.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;You should be able to get woven in the swamp and solo at &gt;10th.  All the<br/>
&gt;frogloks drop woven or mesh of some sort &gt;pretty often. </span></blockquote></div>
