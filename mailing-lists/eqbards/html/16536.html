I had this happen to me the other day when I, er, dreamed, yeah<br/>
that&#39;s it, I was a Teir&#39;Dal Enchanter in Crushbone. I sat down on the throne<br/>
(&quot;I suppose you are all wondering why I asked you here today&quot;) and bid them<br/>
entertain me with displays of martial skill. I commanded the Locals to<br/>
attack them to test their mettle, and I was also curious to see the color of<br/>
Feir&#39;Dal blood. Some doggie there (I suppose to get a dirk or tunic for a<br/>
guildmate) started nipping at my heals, I am not sure if that is a bard only<br/>
thing but it was pretty funny. At any rate, It was a really great, er,<br/>
dream. *smile*<br/>
