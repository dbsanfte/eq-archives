<div id="ygrps-yiv-386083609">Yea the only way I can think of to properly test the proc for this weapon<br/>
would be very dangerous to the bards health.  Bard charms a mob to get it<br/>
really mad at him.  No one else in party attacks mob until sword procs.<br/>
Everyone then attacks.  If mob immediately switches over to another player<br/>
then there is a good chance the proc worked.  A cleric or enchanter would<br/>
need to be on hand to make sure the bard didn&#39;t die.  Even then it might be<br/>
hard to conclusively determine the proc was why the mob stopped attacking<br/>
the bard.  All in all not certain if its worth the time to even worry about<br/>
it.    <br/>

Yeah now the mob is smiling while he beats on ya.  Great graphic for a high<br/>
level weapon huh?  I haven&#39;t heard of anyone being able to tell the saber<br/>
was doing anything when it procs.<br/>

<br/>
does anyone who has one of these notice a bit of difference after it procs?<br/>
it seems to be difficult if not impossible to test.  i get beat on, it procs<br/>
(mob looks peaceful), i get beat on some more hehe.  ah well, it&#39;s the only<br/>
kunark weapon i&#39;ve got and i like it anyway.<br/>
