&gt; (Fennin Ro), you can go there now and camp the pool room (has like 5<br/>
&gt; guardians and 4 sentries and some drakes) for days on end and only see a<br/>
&gt; couple pieces of plate.  Starting to look like imbrued drop rates :(  Bleah,<br/>
&gt; getting armor for my bard is just plain hard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the kinds of fights, you&#39;ll need to be around 53 to pull singles, and<br/>
&gt; even then a few will be blue.  If you want an idea about toughness, think<br/>
&gt; hill giant.  They hit for around 90, and have so many hps it&#39;s scary.  I was<br/>
&gt; with a 55 mage who could solo one if he helped his pet with a couple of<br/>
&gt; nukes.  If there were two, I had to mez or charm because they&#39;d tear his<br/>
&gt; poor pet to shreds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you take a group here, a balanced group of around level 45 will have it<br/>
&gt; pretty easy.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am looking for some information from people who have hunted here. (I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t seem to find anyone on my server that has...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am looking to get some Guardian Armor, and am wondering what kind of<br/>
&gt; &gt; fights I am looking at.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What level group will I need?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Easy to pull Singles?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That sort of stuff...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance for any information you have.<br/>
