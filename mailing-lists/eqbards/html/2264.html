<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504175805">In my original post, I made the assumption that singing Selo&#39;s broke the<br/>
root for everyone in your group but I guess I could be wrong.  If I was<br/>
wrong then I guess I have to retract the first part of the post.<br/>

Bard and Master Brewer on E&#39;ci<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;Last night Roop (a fellow bard) and I were grouping with a party in<br/>
&gt; Highhold<br/>
&gt; &gt;Pass fighting orcs.  After one particular tough battle, one of the party<br/>
&gt; &gt;members stated that the fight would have been a lot easier if he hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt;rooted the entire battle.  I then told him that had he informed the group<br/>
&gt; &gt;that he was rooted, Roop or I could have easily broken him free with<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, I thought that Selo&#39;s only broke a root spell on the bard who<br/>
&gt; sings it, not on the party members. Any confirmation on this?<br/>
