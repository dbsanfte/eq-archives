Darkwind was with us on Sol Ro before they moved.  I would try talking to<br/>
Thalanx (if you&#39;re not already) or Iisbliss, or Deidda, they are all very<br/>
nice and reasonable.  However, if they are the same sort of guild as when<br/>
they were on Sol Ro.  We dealt with their time zone advantage, it was very<br/>
rough at times and Paradigm was pretty, well, happy, when they moved to A<br/>
Ro.<br/>
<br/>
However, we did have a Trak/VS arrangement with them back in the day, and I<br/>
will say that they ALWAYS held up their end of the deal.  So if you make a<br/>
deal, I would bet they would stick to it :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I can not get to EZBoards from work, so I can not comment on the <br/>
&gt; thread you posted a link to.  I do know that EW(my guild) has been <br/>
&gt; kicking around the idea of waking the Sleeper.  One of the main <br/>
&gt; reasons they have been thinking about it is due to pressure from <br/>
&gt; Darkwind.  Not to get too deep into ARo server politics, but DW was <br/>
&gt; immense time zone advantage on ARo and uses it ruthlessly to their <br/>
&gt; advantage (they are a mainly western Europe guild).  They are pretty <br/>
&gt; much the number two guild on the server and have overran us before <br/>
&gt; and not been very forthcoming in trying to work out any kind of <br/>
&gt; arrangement on either Sleepers or N Tov.  And as far as some of the <br/>
&gt; other upcoming guilds (SoT, CB, and others) they have been leaching <br/>
&gt; off of EW&#39;s work for the last month or so.  Case in point was SoT & <br/>
&gt; CB using CoH to try and do the back dragons in N ToV earlier this <br/>
&gt; week to avoid having to fight the tougher mobs at the start.  Also <br/>
&gt; PoM is getting very overcrowded, some nights we have had 30+ people <br/>
&gt; run by us after we have cleared the way to PoM.  Now that we have <br/>
&gt; cleared N ToV three (or four? can not remember) times it is starting <br/>
&gt; to get a little old.  Leaving only 2 real challenges left, the 4th <br/>
&gt; Warder and the AoW.  So I would suspect that EW will be making a real <br/>
&gt; effort on Sleepers sometime in the future. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One interesting thing about Abashi&#39;s post regarding the changes <br/>
&gt; wrought by waking the Sleeper is that it seems to allude to a quest <br/>
&gt; to re-imprison him.  He also hinted at other changes to the zone and <br/>
&gt; I have heard that the guards seem to be dropping more primal then <br/>
&gt; they did in the past.  so it may not be as bad as it would seem if <br/>
&gt; the Sleeper is let loose.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Rokenn, let me right off the bat say I&#39;ve always had great respect <br/>
&gt; for you<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the work you&#39;ve put into your bard and your site. My email is <br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; intended as a bash to you or your guild, but this thread has me <br/>
&gt; concerned.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think its cool that a guild would be attempting this, but if the <br/>
&gt; warders<br/>
&gt; &gt; dont respawn, then to me, bites,  and will have an impact on the <br/>
&gt; entire<br/>
&gt; &gt; server community, not just ew, dw and vv but futur guilds that <br/>
&gt; would like to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go to ST as well... Take Rathe for example, it supposedly has had <br/>
&gt; no warder<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawn since the sleeper was awakened.  :(<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I might have my info wrong, I might not, either way I hope they <br/>
&gt; dont go<br/>
&gt; &gt; away.<br/>
