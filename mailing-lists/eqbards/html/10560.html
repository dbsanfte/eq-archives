  When I have some absurd amount of silver on me, I announce<br/>
  my loc, and that the first person who meets me can get the cash.<br/>
  After a few minutes I destroy it.  I gave some dude over 1400<br/>
  silver last night.  He asked me why I was giving away money,<br/>
  and then he tried to move.  hehe.<br/>
