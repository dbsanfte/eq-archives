<div id="ygrps-yiv-706255384">funny quote from my guildleader Thott, first 60 bard and first with singing<br/>
short sword, in guild chat the other night, when discussing the downfalls of<br/>
being a bard...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;and I never group without an enchanter, NEVER.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
for me grouping was never a problem, because with a 60 usually pulling crowd<br/>
control isn&#39;t too much of a burden on me.  so we could still do whatever we<br/>
wanted in seb or KC, and if no 60 puller we can pull ourselves in a lot of<br/>
places with lament and i work more.  we usually do OK but we&#39;re never able<br/>
to stop the shit from hitting the fan like chanters.  i&#39;m usually in<br/>
tank-heavy groups (at least 3 tanks), we have lots of monks, rogues,<br/>
warriors plus me plus a cleric.  one person i grouped with regularly was the<br/>
first 60 warrior on our server, and the higher level he got the less he<br/>
pulled back to the group =)  so i&#39;ve had an easy life grouping-wise.  i just<br/>
got burnt-out when i hit 57 (i am 57.2, was 57.1 6 weeks ago).  i read the<br/>
new tom clancy (took a month) and went to hawaii.  i am now back into<br/>
playing, but i can guarantee i will never get past level 58, if that heh.  i<br/>
just don&#39;t have the time to put in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Just curious, but what did you do when you logged in and all <br/>
&gt; your guild<br/>
&gt; enchanters were busy in other groups post 55? Any hints on where you<br/>
&gt; played around? The only &quot;pickup&quot; groups I play in are put together<br/>
&gt; mostly from guild members, and when there&#39;s no enchanter, the <br/>
&gt; places to<br/>
&gt; go at 55+ are pretty slim. I can go solo in Tim Deep, or team up with<br/>
&gt; casters in Skyfire, or try to put something together in Karnors or<br/>
&gt; Sebilis. But Karnors is getting green and if the 3 easy spots <br/>
&gt; in Sebilis<br/>
&gt; are taken, without an enchanter it&#39;s pretty slim pickings. </span></blockquote></div>
