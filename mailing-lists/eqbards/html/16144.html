Despite all the cries of nerf from necros, necros are still so<br/>
overpowered compared to the other classes that a single necro<br/>
can do things that require several L50s of other classes.  It<br/>
hasn&#39;t been fixed yet, so my guess is that a couple important<br/>
people at Verant play necros and want to keep things that way.<br/>
Seriously, I think class balance is a low priority with them.<br/>

best treatment  <br/>

At first you might think, man there is no way that something this obviously<br/>
wrong would happen...but lets analyze the situation a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
#1<br/>
<br/>
Abashi plays a necro on Tallon Zek. In the beginning, he was the GM of<br/>
Vallon Zek. It was really funny because in the very beginning he used to<br/>
talk about how badass his necro was going to be. Abashi flipped out one<br/>
night when my friend told him that at level 50, he was just going to Pumice<br/>
off Abashi&#39;s spells then continue to beat his ass. (My friend did not give<br/>
me permission to relay this story, but i cant hold back any longer)<br/>
<br/>
Abashi went off on him, talking about how badass necros were supposed to be,<br/>
how<br/>
they were supposed to be the most powerful caster due to the fact that they<br/>
have bad faction so they need to be able to solo to level 50, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some classes should be able to solo, some should not be&quot;<br/>
- Abashi, 2/24/00<br/>
<br/>
Abashi admitted that he didn&#39;t know what Pumice was. (Hehe isn&#39;t that<br/>
typical for a PvP server? Verant puts n a GM who obviously has no PvP<br/>
experience - how could the GM of a PvP server not know what a pumice was?)<br/>
Abashi told my friend he was going to get pumice taken out of the gameor at<br/>
least get it changed, because pumice was too powerful, and it was total BS,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
You know what? Pumice is still in the game - but now it doesn&#39;t affect necro<br/>
DOT spells the way it used to. Some necro spells are totally immune to<br/>
pumice. The change to pumice happened within a short time after my friend<br/>
told me about that conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#2<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s look at another interesting fact. On the race-war servers, there was a<br/>
massive nerfing of casters spell damage due to mass complaints from melee<br/>
characters. This nerf to spell damage happened only a couple months after<br/>
racewar server opened - at that time Abashi was GM on the VZ server, and<br/>
actively playing his necro (he still does, his necro is in the high 40&#39;s).<br/>
Well, guess how the nerf went down -<br/>
<br/>
DD Spells (wizards only damage) - Nerfed to do only 63% of full damage<br/>
Root Spells (wizards only defense) - Nerfed to stick less and break faster<br/>
<br/>
BOLT Spells (mages) - Nerfed, but still does 75% of full damage<br/>
<br/>
DOT (Necros master of dot) - No nerf in pvp<br/>
LifeTap (Necros take your hp) - No nerf in pvp<br/>
All other necro spells - No nerf in pvp<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Can&#39;t you just hear Gordon in there talking with the tuning team?? Damn<br/>
guys, wizards are just way too strong. We need to nerf DD spells really<br/>
really hard. But you know, necros take so long to do their damage (total bs)<br/>
lets just leave those dot&#39;s spells alone. (Of course many months later, they<br/>
did nerf DOT against monsters to stop the abusive kiting enjoyed by necros<br/>
and druids, but they still do unreal massive damage in pvp)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#3<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s examine Gordon&#39;s thinking about wizards, and lets see if we can find<br/>
such an obvious flaw, that we can look for some personal bias as the reason<br/>
for his position about wizards.<br/>
<br/>
The basic theory is this - wizards were told by Verant &#39;when it comes to<br/>
dishing out damage, wizards have no rival.&#39; Most wizards thought, that means<br/>
they can do the MOST DAMAGE of any caster, but that they will probably have<br/>
weaknesses and drawbacks as a tradeoff. Well they have the weaknesses and<br/>
drawbacks, no pet, no buffs, no debuffs, no heal, no group friends spells,<br/>
no dot&#39;s, no bolts, very little spell diversity. However, Abashi admits that<br/>
when it comes to total damage, wizards are outdamaged by many other casters.<br/>
His explanation, well that line just means wizards are masters of &#39;direct<br/>
damage&#39;. Can you even say that with a straigth face? The whole reasoning he<br/>
uses to ignore wizards is hey you are masters of damage, so powerful that<br/>
you should be one-dimensional and have all these other weaknesses. You think<br/>
all those other weaknesses are in exchange for doing decent dd, but doing<br/>
nowher near as much damage as a necro or mage?<br/>
<br/>
Here are some quotes<br/>
<br/>
&quot;While not as adept at offensive spells as Wizards, Magicians still wield<br/>
considerable power in this area as well.&quot;<br/>
- Verant, Magician Description<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They also have some skill in offensive spells, but are never as skilled as<br/>
a Wizard.&quot;<br/>
- Verant, Enchanter Description<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals.&quot;<br/>
- Verant, Original Wizard Description<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When it comes to dishing out &#39;magical&#39; damage, wizards have no rival.&quot; <br/>
- Verant, Late 1999 Change to Description<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wizards had this expectation that they&#39;d be much more powerful than the<br/>
other casting classes. But that line you&#39;ve quoted speaks of Direct Damage<br/>
spells.&quot;<br/>
- Verant, Abashi Post 3/10/00<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Take the FAQ to mean direct damage, or take it to mean damage in a given<br/>
amount of time.&quot;<br/>
- Verant, Abashi Post 3/14/00<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Did you expect that you&#39;d be able to do more damage in a full load of mana?<br/>
I&#39;m sorry,<br/>
that just isn&#39;t the case. Most of the other casting classes can do more<br/>
damage than<br/>
wizards.&quot;<br/>
- Verant, Abashi Post 3/14/00<br/>
<br/>
If this doesnt make it obvious enough, consider abashi&#39;s response to massive<br/>
wizards complaints that even their DD sucks because the resistance just<br/>
out-of-control at high levels.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Perhaps an enchanter and/or shaman is required equipment for a wizard in<br/>
the same fashion that a cleric is required equipment for a warrior.&quot;<br/>
- Verant, Abashi post, 2/11/00<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* AMAZING - masters of damage, uh yeah that means masters of &#39;direct damage&#39;<br/>
and uh yeah you need an enchanter and a shaman with out at all time in order<br/>
to even do that. Give me a break Gordon.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some of Abashi&#39;s posts on Necromancers in response to someone saying<br/>
Necros were having problems..These are all quotes from Abashi from 1/7/00,<br/>
his responses to a player (incredibly) whining about necros.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Necromancer&#39;s always were and continue to be xtremely powerful. There<br/>
haven&#39;t been any changes/fixes/nerfs to them that have significantly altered<br/>
their<br/>
level of power. They are maybe 5% weaker than they were [at launch],<br/>
assuming<br/>
you&#39;ve adapted to the change. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Me? I love the necromancer, they are my favorite class.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yep. Had a 16th level necro in beta (22 days played) and I have a mid-40s<br/>
necro now on<br/>
one of the Zeks (32 days played). &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The necro is a far better soloer than the magician. It isn&#39;t even close. It<br/>
got closer when magicians gained the root-casting earth pet, but it&#39;s still<br/>
the<br/>
necro, hands down. In fact, the magicians actually need to be enhanced a<br/>
bit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That change/fix/nerf should hardly be noticeable and is nearly unresistable<br/>
for<br/>
anything within the level range. The only time you should hit a resist is if<br/>
you cast on deep reds, outside the acceptable level range. The chance of<br/>
resist on anything lower than 7 levels above you is like 1 in 1000. I just<br/>
whipped up a necromancer on the<br/>
Test Server to make sure I wasn&#39;t nuts. I went into Lower Guk and tried a 33<br/>
necro versus a few level 40 frogs. I went 50 for 50 on assorted life tap<br/>
spells. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HERE IS THE CLENCHER<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Player&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But look at the damage on lifetap! A level 50<br/>
necromancer&#39;s best nuke is 320 damage for 210 mana...a level 34 wizard does<br/>
better, thats &quot;balanced&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is also not true. 320 might be the damage on the top lifetap, but it<br/>
is NOT<br/>
the 50 necromancer&#39;s best nuke.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
CAN YOU IMAGINE? Its a LIFE-TAP spell, it not only NUKES, it gives the necro<br/>
the targets hitpoints. Unbelievable.<br/>
<br/>
This &quot;nuke&quot; was not nerfed in pvp. So Necros mana:damage efficiency ratio<br/>
stayed at the same leve, but wizards dd fell dramatically, making Necros<br/>
nuke at the ratio wizards nuked at, AND TAKING THE HP of their target to<br/>
boot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You look at what verant said about wizards, its so obvious wizards were<br/>
supposed to do more damage than anyone else, masters of damage. You look at<br/>
Abashi&#39;s spin-doctoring, and then it becomes clear that he is so personally<br/>
biased against wizards (due to his own necro, and his desire for necros to<br/>
remain so powerful compared to wizards).<br/>
<br/>
Abashi&#39;s comments about wizards in the last 2 weeks has started an uproar of<br/>
complaints, showing that he disregards the class. Look up his posts, hes<br/>
made a ton of comments about wizards that show such an obvious bias against<br/>
wizards, there is only one explanation. Abashi knows wizards got screwed,<br/>
but he does NOT want Verant to live up to its promise that wizards would<br/>
have NO rival in dishing out damage.<br/>
<br/>
Its not enough for abashi that Necros are the masters of solo, masters of<br/>
DoT, they have the best pet, they can heal themselves by taking hit point,<br/>
they can give themselves more mana, they can give mana to those around them,<br/>
they have unbelievable power to DoT, they can buff, they can debuff, they<br/>
can root, they can snare, they can turn you into a skeleton when you are<br/>
near your guards, making you KoS to guards, they can even Feign Death and on<br/>
and on and on. (remember verant nerfed the FD to wear off, due to players<br/>
complaining that necros could solo the ghoul lord room - i bet ya abashi had<br/>
never pointed that one out)<br/>
<br/>
Haha there was all the outrage when people found out that Necromancers would<br/>
pop a pet in a good exp place, then let the pet fight. They would Feign<br/>
death, and go afk continuing to get experience while their pet kicked ass<br/>
with danger to themselves. How long did Abashi know about that one?<br/>
<br/>
The bias towards necromancers should come as NO shock to anyone anymore.<br/>
Necros got special treatment in PvP, basically the opposite treatment from<br/>
wizards. Wizards ONLY way of doing damage, nerfed harder than ANY other<br/>
spell. Necros spell - they didnt get one single nerf. (Later it became so<br/>
obvious that player petitions may have gotten some minor nerfs to necros,<br/>
but still havent tested since the original nerf patch).<br/>
<br/>
Can you prove this? Probably not...but look at Abashi&#39;s attitude in his<br/>
posts, consider that he&#39;s got a necro on a pvp server, consider that he is a<br/>
GM, and consider that Necros didnt get nerfed in pvp damage anywhere near<br/>
the extrem that wizards were nerfed....add it all up, and what do you think? </span></blockquote></div>
