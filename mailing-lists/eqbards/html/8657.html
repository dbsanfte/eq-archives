&gt; Maybe we should put the answer to this in the FAQ?  Also, can you<br/>
&gt; put the FAQ in a directory at onelist?  That way you don&#39;t have to send<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; the entire FAQ every week, just send the link.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
generally the people who type the &quot;remove me now&quot; or the &quot;unsubscribe me&quot;<br/>
messages, are just too slack to look for themselves, sheesh, they where<br/>
smart enough to subscribe themself, surely unscribing isnt too hard. So to<br/>
expect these people to even know what a FAQ is or where to look for one is<br/>
pushing it. Crickey I have been on lists where unscription info is on EVERY<br/>
email, and fools still sent the unsubscribe me messages. Sad isnt. </span></blockquote></div>
