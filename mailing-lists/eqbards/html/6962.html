&gt; I think that party effect would be less realistic.  More convienient for<br/>
&gt; sure, but not as roleplayable.  Here is my take.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the trade window is the key.  This is how you show items to friends<br/>
&gt; anyway, with relative safty.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm. My experience with the trade window is that it&#39;s a good way to lose<br/>
items. It has several bugs still that will on rare occasions lose the<br/>
item you are showing your friend when one of you cancel&#39;s the<br/>
transaction. This has happened to enough people I know that no one asks<br/>
to see things in the trade window anymore.<br/>
<br/>
And before someone jumps in claiming it&#39;s a rumor I have actually seen<br/>
it happen. While in Unrest a friend wanted to show me the first earring<br/>
he&#39;d made with jewellry craft. He put it in the trade window, I looked<br/>
at it, then hit cancel. He could not find it in his inventory anywhere.<br/>
He was lucky enough to get a GM who was giving someone a last name to<br/>
look for it for him, and somehow the GM managed to locate it, even<br/>
though it was invisible to anyone else in the area. (and no, his<br/>
inventory was not full when this happened)<br/>
