Okay, this was a great technical description of the Kithicor, although there are things about it you<br/>
only discover over time, the spawn is VERY quirky and particular, way more than described.<br/>
<br/>
But I and many others are convinced this is not all there is to Kithicor. There is story there, very<br/>
odd and mysterious story. If you are looking for &quot;Levelquest&quot; this is NOT your zone. If you are<br/>
looking to gain an understanding of one of the weirdest zones in the game, go spend some time in<br/>
Kithicor. You can run through it a hundred times and not notice much, you can spend a night hunting<br/>
spawn spots and not notice much, but over time you will begin to notice little odd things. Things<br/>
which in of themselves don&#39;t seem like much, but collectivly are odd enough to make you wonder.<br/>
<br/>
The behaviors of Ged and Luna??? (I forget her exact name BUT we all believe it is not accidental<br/>
that she has the moon reference in her name). We are quite sure they are involved...and when she is<br/>
parted from him for a while she *runs* back. What is the story behind that?<br/>
<br/>
Ghouls that stand upright (spotted one night).<br/>
<br/>
One minute Ged is standing there happily, the next moment, a werewolf...(seen by a friend)<br/>
<br/>
One night I saw Luna?? run into a burned out house and a female zombie run out.<br/>
<br/>
And why doesn&#39;t she speak?<br/>
<br/>
There appears to be references to Kithicors past in the History of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
The undead army. It&#39;s not there all the time, but when it IS there, it&#39;s just plain weird.<br/>
<br/>
*one* goblin? How often do you see a lone goblin? Not named, just a regular ol&#39; goblin. Is he lost?<br/>
<br/>
No music, no footsteps NOTHING. Just plain spooky. After some time there walking out into W<br/>
Commonlands feels like stepping into a cheery garden...The whole place, from the merchants to the<br/>
other residents to the locked buildings to the bizarre nature of the spawn...The Truth is Out There.<br/>
And you won&#39;t find it while leveling through...<br/>
