<b>Subject:</b> Lyssra&#39;s Darkwood Picaro Effect Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-644242507">Hi, Lyssra&#39;s Darkwood Picaro (I believe is proper name) dropped off of the<br/>
1st Cazic Thule dispatched on Tribunal last night. Being the only Bard part<br/>
of the raiding party, I received this instrument with no contest. It appears<br/>
to be a flute by picture, I however, cannot find any information regarding<br/>
this items and any effects it may have. I cannot think of any way to test<br/>
any possible increased effect, due to the fact that it is a wind instrument.<br/>
Does anyone have any knowledge of this item, or know of a way that I might<br/>
test any effects it may have? Thanks.<br/>
