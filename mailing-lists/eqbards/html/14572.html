<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256050969">The fish there do drop scales, but not enough for you to rely solely<br/>
on them, IMHO.  Fish scales can be purchased in bulk from one of the<br/>
merchants near Inn 3 in the east commonlands (bat wings too).  A good<br/>
idea would be to have a magician summon a couple of the appropriate<br/>
rings or stones for everyone who doesn&#39;t have a Fishbone Earring or<br/>
an Aqualung or a Rebreather.  That way they have something ready in<br/>
case of an emergency.<br/>

 &gt; I can&#39;t answer your question about bulk purchases but I do know a lot of the<br/>
 &gt; the fishes you kill in Kedge drop fish scales so it shouldn&#39;t be hard for<br/>
 &gt; rangers/druids to replenish their supplies while they are down there.<br/>

 &gt; &gt;     The talk of Kedge Keep has me very interested and my Guild Leader and<br/>
 &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been planning an outing on ICQ.  The question is; short of fishing;<br/>
 &gt; &gt; where can Fish Scales be purchased in bulk?<br/>
