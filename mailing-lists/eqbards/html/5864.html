picked the container up (two seconds tops - look down and click) and they were<br/>
no longer in the container.  Yes, I verified that the Claws were actually *in*<br/>
the container prior to performing the trade.  I didn&#39;t get hussled, I merely<br/>
dropped a container with Claws in them and they were destroyed by the game.<br/>

Bladed Thulian Claws on the ground?  Yeah, I did that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll start a Troll Shaman or something.  Lotta fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got an Ogre Shaman - it&#39;s a very close tie as<br/>
&gt; to which is more entertaining between that and my<br/>
&gt; half-elf Bard. My Bard can get into cities though,<br/>
&gt; so that keeps me playing him.. That and at level 14,<br/>
&gt; the mana consumption of a Shaman is very high and<br/>
&gt; results in boring medding times that we don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to go through with our Bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thulian Claws the other night and they&#39;re LORE.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They were destroyed before they hit the ground<br/>
&gt; &gt; - 700pp flushed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure what happened to you here, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; dropped my Dragoon Dirk (LORE) and picked it up<br/>
&gt; again. Being LORE simply means that you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; own two of them. Your claws should have been on<br/>
&gt; the ground where you dropped them. Maybe not very<br/>
&gt; visible - but still there.<br/>
