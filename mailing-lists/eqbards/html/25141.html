<div id="ygrps-yiv-395390644">Wow hits in the 90&#39;s, I&#39;d love to do that so much, my highest hit is<br/>
something like 48...<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of helping each other out... Does anyone else get all excited when<br/>
someone decides to play their bard as their main in the guild? or recruit a<br/>
new bard?  One of our old time clerics came out of retirement and has been<br/>
powerleveling his bard up, and is now level 45.  Now to me this is great<br/>
news as I&#39;ve been the only bard in the guild for the longest time and I&#39;m<br/>
only 53 (forever) and have gone on a few raids and have been only crowd<br/>
control (which i love doing but get nervous sometimes). Example of this<br/>
would be in Air when all chanters drop and I&#39;m only one left standing trying<br/>
to mez the azaracks, or last week in PoG with only chanter there is only<br/>
there for haste and C2 (btw i love pulling in pog and intercepting the<br/>
protectors of growth!).  We&#39;ve got another bard as well that is 51 and<br/>
leveling pretty fast.  Its kind of nice, we&#39;re a tight circle and do as many<br/>
hand me downs on gear between us as we can.  I had no idea the new bard was<br/>
45 allready, so now hand me downs are going to be a wider circle. I cant<br/>
wait for them both to hit 53 and get twilight.  Oh and instruments, the<br/>
guild went to sirens grotto other night and the 51 bard got himself a new<br/>
immaculate horn or whatever its called and a drums of the beast.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I&#39;m just saying its nice that people help each other out as much as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling on but hey, I&#39;m in a good mood cause I&#39;ve had my first coffee,<br/>
i&#39;ve had a long week, its finally friday and I finally got my stupid HS key<br/>
last night woot. <br/>
<br/>
Have a great weekend everyone 8)<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Shada! I had already put my flute up. I&#39;ll probably dump the Vox<br/>
horn next time I&#39;m near a bank too. Looks like I will keep my Lath Drinor in<br/>
my offhand. I was using it and a Croaking dagger. I have been seeing melee<br/>
hits for up to 80 some. Klaget said he saw a 90 while we were in Skyshrine<br/>
last weekend, so the epic really helped out my melee. Before, my best hits<br/>
were in the 50s max.<br/>
<br/>
Slyde: Gratz on the new weapon! I have never seen one of those and we have<br/>
spent alot of time in HS south. <br/>
<br/>
Atonal, I personally don&#39;t have a char around 35, I have a 45 wiz and a 24<br/>
cleric. Some good friends of mine are around 40 though (or were this past<br/>
weekend, may be higher now). If we&#39;re not on, try looking for Delania/Chubb.<br/>
Chubb is a shaman pl&#39;ing his rogue, Delania, on a second account. He&#39;s<br/>
usually in CoM. Tell him you&#39;re a pal of mine looking for a group. Chubb<br/>
keeps saying he wants his own bard! We may be able to group when I play my<br/>
wiz, which I am going to concentrate on getting her out of 45 in the near<br/>
future. Link to our guild message board:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub8.ezboard.com/bvenatorsapentia.">http://pub8.ezboard.com/bvenatorsapentia.</a> Drive by and say hello to all the<br/>
crazy people! <br/>
<br/>
Scales: Work on your epic quest and do all the one group, one person parts.<br/>
Having that stuff done ups your chances of getting priority on a scale drop.<br/>
As to guilds, well VS doesn&#39;t really have the numbers on at any one time to<br/>
kill a dragon. What we do have is alliances with other guilds in the same<br/>
boat. Alliances are sorta like marriages though so you do have to do some<br/>
checking on the partner first. The easiest way is to make friends in other<br/>
guilds and help anyone you can do their epic battles. I know we are on a<br/>
serious Gore watch right now for Reorn to get his Frost tome. If I&#39;m on,<br/>
I&#39;ll try and look for you guys when we get our next shot. I can&#39;t promise<br/>
you will get the scale but meeting people who can and do kill dragons<br/>
regularly is a good thing! When we went to kill Trak for me the second time,<br/>
it looked almost like a HL lemming rush. I was not minded to turn any one of<br/>
my friends away and so many wanted to come help. We like killing dragons,<br/>
and we like helping people we know to be good people do their epic quests.<br/>
