<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835236943">Last night I had an interesting experience in Nagafen&#39;s Lair (SolB) I <br/>
thought I&#39;d share - I had a chance to empirically test out two different <br/>
approaches to combat in an unbalanced group.<br/>
<br/>
I was in a pickup group of warrior, warrior, shadowknight, mage, enchanter <br/>
(all 40-44) and me, a charming, debonair, devil-may-care woodelf bard with <br/>
37 songs.  Obviously I was the only healer (ack!) but thankfully the group <br/>
was pretty high-powered and the tanks knew their jobs.  We were in the pool <br/>
room fighting swarms of GKs, which the enchanter thankfully kept enthralled. <br/>
  The mage, a guildmate of mine, was doing incredible damage with his new <br/>
44th level DD and his pet, so most of the kobolds went down pretty fast.  <br/>
That said, they can hit pretty hard...<br/>
<br/>
For the first two hours or so I did my standard fighting mix (celerity, <br/>
chains, psalm) and hymn/clarity in the downtime.  The fights went along <br/>
smoothly enough, though it was a constant struggle to keep everyone healed <br/>
up.  I was doing my part adding to the damage with my ugly stick and silvery <br/>
war axe, and everyone seemed happy.  I did have to scold the somewhat <br/>
hyperactive warrior who was pulling, asking him to please let me heal him <br/>
every now and again (between combats he&#39;d be running around looking for <br/>
targets, and between fights was the only time any healing happened).<br/>
<br/>
The night wore on, and I decided to test a different tactic: chains, <br/>
celerity, hymn, wielding a mandolin the whole fight.  I reasoned that I was <br/>
not doing much of the damage, and perhaps the fights would go the same <br/>
either way... the results exceeded my expectations by quite a bit.  Where <br/>
before one or both fighters and sometimes the mage would be down a bubble or <br/>
two after each round of a few GKs, now nobody lost even a half bubble of <br/>
health.  I still waded into melee and did *some* damage with my fists, but <br/>
the difference in the amount I healed was enough to keep the group at or <br/>
around full health for another hour or so, by which time it was late and I <br/>
had to go.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, we watched the zone go from 30 people down to 7 by the time I <br/>
left - yeah, there was one lone wizard by the zone blasting, and our <br/>
group... and that was IT, empty zone at 1am PST.  Turns out everyone was in <br/>
Hate. = )<br/>
