max).  The lower /con the mob, the more likely it&#39;ll last the<br/>

won&#39;t.  It also seems to depend on the mob&#39;s magic resist, but<br/>
in general Chain lasts the full duration 90% of the time<br/>
against white /cons or lower for me.  It drops off pretty<br/>
quickly though, to where if I want to keep a red Chained while<br/>
fleeing, I will usually have to drop my other songs and just<br/>
hit it with Chain over and over.  Otherwise it breaks out<br/>
often enough after just one pulse as to make it pointless.<br/>

broken out of and lasts a fixed duration as claimed, then it<br/>
is indeed superior.<br/>
