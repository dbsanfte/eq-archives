<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523369276"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>
&gt;Damage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>
&gt;Casts berserker strnegth occasionally, but I don&#39;t know what this is.<br/>
&gt;Have no idea where it is found.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have one of these.  The Berserker Strength raises your strength, lowers <br/>
your agility, and gives you temporary magical skin that absorbs a certain <br/>
amount of damage (or maybe a certain number of hits, not sure).  It also <br/>
&quot;locks&quot; the song you&#39;re currently singing, making it crippling for a Bard <br/>
to use.  I&#39;ve heard reports that the Tentacle Whip and Screaming Mace also <br/>
have this bug.  We suspect that all magic weapons that cast spells in <br/>
combat probably do the same thing.  Please, everyone, file /bug reports so <br/>
this goes higher on their priority list to fix!  Currently my spiffy <br/>
Tomahawk is gathering dust in the bank, because I can&#39;t use it without <br/>
totally hosing myself.  :(<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it&#39;s found on a named NPC Gnoll in Highpass.<br/>
