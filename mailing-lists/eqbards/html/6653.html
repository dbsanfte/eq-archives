Bard Song Fixed<br/>
Community News [ 1:41 PM PDT ] - Keyan<br/>
From Fletch:<br/>
Before the latest two patches, the level 43 Bard song, a mana using AoE<br/>
damage song called &quot;Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge&quot;, damaged the bard as well as<br/>
surrounding mobs. This has been fixed. The song will no longer damage the<br/>
bard when sung. I tried it against two mobs, they each took 288 points of<br/>
non-melee damage, while my health bar remained unaffected.</div>
