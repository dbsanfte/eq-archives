<div id="ygrps-yiv-185463230">There seems an obvious application for a magic flute to me: increased range. <br/>
  Does anybody have an easy time using invisibility on their party?  Water <br/>
breathing?  I sure don&#39;t, due to the feeble ranges on these songs... anyhow <br/>
I would love to have Die Zauberfl´┐¢te even if it does nothing more than give <br/>
better song sprites, or allow females to dance (my heart goes out to them).<br/>
<br/>
A magic lute would doubtless be deemed too powerful, as it might allow us to <br/>
(gasp!) do more damage or heal better.  Never mind that there are dozens of <br/>
items that raise mana for casters, effectively making them better at dealing <br/>
damage or healing...<br/>
<br/>
What I foresee is this: to still the slowly rising tide of complaints from <br/>
bards who feel that they have fewer class-specific items than any other <br/>
class, Verant will introduce a new brass instrument, the Giant&#39;s Ear Horn.  <br/>
It weighs 20.0, adds 1% to all brass-based songs, and also gives +5 mana.  <br/>
It&#39;s dropped by a new named 64th level giant in North Karana named Tinear <br/>
(rare drop on a rare spawn), and has the side effect of increasing all <br/>
monster&#39;s aggro radius by 10% around you.<br/>
<br/>
Aloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>
just a tad bit cynical about Verant&#39;s support of bards - great class, loads <br/>
of fun despite being the redheaded stepchild of EQ = )</div>
