person with 3 or 4 computers who twinked himself using other accounts.  I<br/>
heard Furor (formerly Kalaran, first level 50 on any server, in case you<br/>
forgot) had people playing him, but really don&#39;t know too much about<br/>
that situation.<br/>

	There&#39;s a LOT of rumors associated with this whole thing.  I&#39;ve<br/>
heard stories such as &quot;Elderan had 3 groups killing stuff down to a sliver<br/>
then blurring it, so he was killing stuff with 2 or 3 swings, turning,<br/>
killing another thing in 2 or 3 swings, and getting solo exp on all of<br/>
them&quot;.  Hehe.  It&#39;s really kinda funny what people can come up with,<br/>
especially on something so cheesy.<br/>
