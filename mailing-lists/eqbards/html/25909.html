<div id="ygrps-yiv-633166141">I tried one of the earlier FF games.  The thing for me - I&#39;ve always played<br/>
PC games since my first computer - and Apple 2+ that I bought in 1981.<br/>
There were already console games by that time -and it&#39;s always been clear<br/>
that PC games are better in some ways - and consoles better in others. I<br/>
think arguing the superiority argument is stupid.  They are different - and<br/>
some people prefer one - others like both.<br/>
<br/>
Most Console ports to PC&#39;s keep that console look-and-feel - and the FF<br/>
games especially so.  If you don&#39;t care for that type of game - it&#39;s not<br/>
going to do much for you...<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I play EQ so much - that there&#39;s no point to buy other games.  I<br/>
have Civ3 on my hard disk.  Civ 1 and 2 were my favorite games of all time.<br/>
I stayed up all night playing them.  I&#39;ve never gotten a Civ3 game out of<br/>
the medieval era...<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like puzzle-solving games in general. Since solving any<br/>
puzzle is just a matter of time, I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s worth the trouble. I<br/>
prefer games with a more &quot;organic&quot; feel, which are complex enough to not<br/>
appear a series of problems, but a sort of abstract set of conditions which<br/>
one must gradually master. Civilization is the best example of this (Alpha<br/>
Centauri, especially), and even StarCraft (but not the lesser realtime<br/>
strategy games), and of course EverQuest. Oh, I loved Star Control 3, too.<br/>
