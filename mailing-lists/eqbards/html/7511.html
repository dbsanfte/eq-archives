&gt;I&#39;d have to seriously disagree that there is a 50/50 split in binders and<br/>

&gt;as the rogue class?  None I suspect.  The warrior class?  Another big none.<br/>
&gt;The bard class?  Another big none.<br/>
&gt;Shaman&#39;s maybe?  How many 6 person groups even have 3 non-binders and 3<br/>
&gt;binders?  One that I have been in and that was only cause it was two real<br/>
&gt;tanks and 3 binders who needed a sixth.  The rest have 2 tanking<br/>

&gt;what its like on Mith Marr, but on E&#39;ci non-binders are a minority in<br/>
&gt;hunting zones and a majority in cities.  I half think Verant put in the<br/>
&gt;anonymous thing just so no one could use hard numbers to prove people don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;play melee/hybrid classes because of binding.  The only people I know who<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t playing binders now are either bards or frankly are not swift enough<br/>
&gt;to handle the complexity of playing a caster.  Some of those are starting<br/>

&gt;i didn&#39;t say it was one of the single abilities that would limit a class,<br/>
&gt;but it is like all other abilities of other classes a deciding factor.  if<br/>
&gt;it were as important as you say, a large majority of the population would<br/>
&gt;consist of players that can bind.  i do not see this to be the case, and<br/>
&gt;therefore i can not agree with you.  the population is about 50/50 with<br/>
&gt;players who can and can not bind.  some people may use the binding ability<br/>
&gt;to determine which class they will play, but most do not.  therefore it<br/>

&gt;&gt; This is the first time I have ever rabidly disagreed with you<br/>
&gt;&gt; Michael.  Brad<br/>
&gt;&gt; has stated on numerous occassions that it is their concept of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the game that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;No single ability should play a major decision in a person&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; decision to<br/>
&gt;&gt; play a particular class or group thereof.  If it does it is<br/>
&gt;&gt; unbalancing and<br/>
&gt;&gt; needs to be changed.&quot;<br/>
