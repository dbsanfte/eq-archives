<div id="ygrps-yiv-563202678">The same with all parts of EQ,   it adds up<br/>
the one or 2 ac difference with a lot of bronze, will add up  plus it looks<br/>
really cool!, although if you have a low strength, like in the 70&#39;s I don&#39;t<br/>
suggest it, at least for medium sizes.  I don&#39;t know the difference in<br/>
weight between small bronze and medium bronze.<br/>

     Hail all,<br/>
<br/>
         I was wondering if there is any consensus on whether there is any<br/>
     damage absorbion effect from different types of armor over and above<br/>
     the change in AC?<br/>
<br/>
     When I upgraded to Banded I seemed to notice that not only was I<br/>
     getting hit less often but also for less damage.  So I am wondering if<br/>
     bronze plate might have the same advantage.  Bronze is only slightly<br/>
     better then banded ac wise (1 or 2 ac better depending on the piece)<br/>
     but weights almost twice as much.  Not a very good trade off<br/>
     considering the weight problem that most of us have.<br/>
<br/>
     So, in a nutshell, is Bronze plate worth the extra weight?  Does plate<br/>
     have an advantage over banded other then the AC increase?<br/>
<br/>
     Thanks for you help!<br/>
