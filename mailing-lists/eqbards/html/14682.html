<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061710695">Thanks for the first hand report!<br/>
<br/>
He is connected with more than one quest and some quest dialogs do &quot;trigger<br/>
spawns&quot; (ala Bronin Higgensbot and Slaythe in Misty Thicket) so that might<br/>
be something to try (run the dialog for one of the quests.)<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, there is the &quot;report of the undead army...&quot;  I think this is where you<br/>
collect the lore item bones from the various putrid skellies and deliver<br/>
them to some one in Qeynos? You talk to the guard on top of the bridge tower<br/>
to start this one.  Hmmm, wonder if that is the Lord Grimlot trigger because<br/>
he is mentioned by name by  that guard.<br/>

&gt; I have seen him at the undead area in SK twice this past week.  Both times<br/>
&gt; it was daylight.  So he is still around. </span></blockquote></div>
