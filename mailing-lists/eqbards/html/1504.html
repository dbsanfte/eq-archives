&gt; How much trouble does everyone else have with lvl 3-8 parties attempting to<br/>
&gt; take things like orc camps?  My party today (me, 2 dwarf clerics, 1 monk, and<br/>
&gt; 2 paladins all lvls 7-10) spent about 3 hours camping one of the orc camps<br/>
&gt; near the Hidden Inn in E. Commons.  After the first hard battle, we took them<br/>
&gt; one or two at a time.  It worked out quite well and nearly got me to lvl 9. <br/>
&gt; When we disbanded, I moved along to the Hidden Inn to pick up another party. <br/>
&gt; Within 15 minutes, I had died 3 times from people training Centurions and<br/>
&gt; Legionnaires to the inn from the other orc camp.  For some reason, I feel<br/>
&gt; obligated to help these morons out every time and it tends to cost me quite a<br/>
&gt; bit of my xp.  Needless to say I am 1 1/2 bubble away from 9 now.  Does<br/>
&gt; anyone have any thoughts on how I should handle these types of situations? <br/>
&gt; From what I understand from this list, the lvl 8 song would be a great help.<br/>

levelling.  You decide.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestion #2 - Find less active areas.  There is a fine balance between &quot;just<br/>
enough critters&quot; and &quot;too many&quot;, and sometimes it takes a while to find such an<br/>
area, only to have a train dragged down on you.  Oh well - live and learn (or<br/>
die and learn, in this case ;)</div>
