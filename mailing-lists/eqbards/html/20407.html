<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035501367">Since I just hit 30 my answers may not be the wisest<br/>
and most well thought out yet... but this is what ive<br/>
been doing.  I have 3 songs memmed for combat. Psalm<br/>
(stacking dmg shields - 6pts now - are great!) Hymn<br/>
(13pts/tic with lute) and Furfil&#39;s chant (15pts/tic<br/>
with MM Drum) Ive put away my weapons for a bit, I<br/>
still carry them.. but only use them when we are low<br/>
on tanks or we need a quick death to break a spawn<br/>
(same songs sans instruments)<br/>
The other songs i usually haved memmed these days are<br/>
invis, chains, charm, mez and selos or jig (Ive been<br/>
grouping with a shaman alot lately so let selos off<br/>
sometimes)<br/>
