<div id="ygrps-yiv-34025255">Ok, here are some preliminary results from checking Agility this weekend:<br/>
<br/>
	Agility	Base AC	Tunic(AC)	RawTunic(AC)<br/>
<br/>
	70		1				Dwarf Cleric<br/>
	75		5				Dwarf Cleric<br/>
	80		10				Dwarf Cleric<br/>
	95		17		22		3 Halfling Warrior<br/>
	100		17		22		3 Halfling Warrior<br/>
	101		17		22		3 Halfling Warrior<br/>
	105		18		23		3 Halfling Warrior<br/>
	110		18		23		3 Halfling Warrior<br/>
	111		20		24		3 Halfling Warrior<br/>
	115		21		23		2 Halfling Rogue<br/>
	120		21		23		2 Halfling Rogue<br/>
	121		22		24		2 Halfling Rogue<br/>
	125		22		24		2 Halfling Rogue<br/>
	126		23		25		2 Halfling Rogue<br/>
	130		23		25		2 Halfling Rogue<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly the Guild Tunic AC was greater than listed at Agility &lt; 111<br/>
for the rogue and warrior.  5 vs 3 listed for warrior, and 3 vs 2 listed for<br/>
rogue.  At 111+ Agility there was no difference for the rogue in listed vs<br/>
gained AC from a tunic at 2, while the warrior still gained 4 AC from a<br/>
tunic listed at 3.<br/>
<br/>
At 351 AC my wood elf bard&#39;s AC increased to 353 with an agility increase<br/>
from 104 to 106.  I hope to gain an item or two to raise it to 111 and<br/>
report back on the change.  Obviously the greatest change is from 70 to 90<br/>
Agility and there appears to be no difference in race, the dwarf cleric<br/>
matched up with the halfling warrior as soon as he reached the warriors<br/>
agility.  I will report more on this as I gather more data.<br/>
