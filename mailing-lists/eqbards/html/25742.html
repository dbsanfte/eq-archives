<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546464454">Someone on Concert Hall suggested a theory (actually did a bit of <br/>
watching to come up with it) that the Undead Bard is on a flat 20 <br/>
hour spawn cycle and is KOS to Trakanon.<br/>
<br/>
If this is true, the seemingly random spawn times seem to come from <br/>
people not knowing when he actually died last (i.e. most of the time <br/>
that knowing precisely when Trakanon spawns) and relating his spawn <br/>
time to Trak&#39;s death, not the Undead Bards.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the server pops and both Trak and UDB spawn.  Trak kills <br/>
UDB.  20 hours from that point, if Trak is dead, the UDB will spawn <br/>
and stay up.  If Trak dies 18 hours after server pop, the UDB will be <br/>
up in 2 hours.  If Trak dies 21 hours after server pop, the UDB will <br/>
be up in 19 hours (he&#39;d already spawned and was whacked by Trak once).<br/>

can&#39;t say for sure. </span></blockquote></div>
