You can turn one in for a GOOD magical 1hand blunt<br/>
staff that anyone can use. The Darkwood Staff<br/>
<br/>
This could be affecting your ability to get someone to give<br/>
you one.<br/>
<br/>
You also have to find out how much the merchants will give you<br/>
for one if you sell it to them. IF it is on the order of multiple<br/>
platinum, that may be another reason people are unwilling to sell cheaper<br/>
to you. You have to beat the market for it.<br/>

&gt;I have a problem with obtaining lambent stones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m running around NRo/Oasis/SRo regularly now and shouting out for lambent<br/>
&gt;stones assuming people will be cool and just give them to the poor bard who<br/>
&gt;needs them for his armor quest like most people do with all the rest of the<br/>
&gt;no-drop quest components for all the other classes.  I assumed wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying to cash in<br/>
&gt;on lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>
&gt;cheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>
&gt;saying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>
&gt;refuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent over 1000pp<br/>
&gt;purchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not<br/>
&gt;going to hand<br/>
&gt;some greedy bugger more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Soooo, I am now camping SG&#39;s in oasis every opportunity I can but<br/>
&gt;I killed 4<br/>
&gt;last night and did not find a single one.  I am joining pickup groups for<br/>
&gt;the purpose of giant hunting and I often have to convince my group members<br/>
&gt;that they should let me loot a stone should we find one.  I just don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I still need about 7 lambent stones total for the rest of my armor and I am<br/>
&gt;certainly not willing to pay another 200-1000pp to obtain them, I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;have that kind of money anymore after buying the other components.  But I<br/>
&gt;have been looking for my next stone for 4 in-game days now and<br/>
&gt;have killed 5<br/>
&gt;giants and am still empty-handed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations apart from soloing in<br/>
&gt;the Rathe mts and charming giants to kill each other?<br/>
