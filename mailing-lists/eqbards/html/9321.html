&gt; &gt; GZ: I have got to say that I love my 1/2 elf Bard - but <br/>
&gt; &gt; mostly because when<br/>
&gt; &gt; I play, I am a very social player. Bards are good at being <br/>
&gt; &gt; social. In fact,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I built them to be so. This is my current one - I have played <br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot of EQ,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and tend to change my opinion every few weeks. <br/>
