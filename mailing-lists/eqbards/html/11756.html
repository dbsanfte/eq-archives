<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033470311">The &#39;absolute&#39; part is debatable - imho.   We have heard snippets of &quot;we<br/>
were shocked that players got level 50 in xx days played...&quot; makes me think<br/>
that they (Verant) are concerned with &#39;how hard&#39; it is to make levels, etc.<br/>
Like why have hell levels? If they want to have some kind of milestone, it<br/>
should be a positive re-enforcement - not a negative.  If they want to<br/>
retain players, that is. More than half of my friends who I started this<br/>
game with have pretty much ended their EQ careers because it got to be just<br/>
too hard (and too boring) to make progress.  In short, it was no fun any<br/>
more.  A few others have made level 50 - the level of nothing to do. And so<br/>
they re-start chars in other classes.<br/>
<br/>
Here are 2 scenarios:<br/>
<br/>
EQ-X: hard to play.  Serious players make lev 50. It takes you 6 months of<br/>
concentrated playing. You start a couple twinks and play them to upper 20&#39;s<br/>
and a new game comes out somewhere else that is more fun than then next 10<br/>
levels killing aviaks. So you semi-retire your 50 and maybe do occasional<br/>
dragons.  But then you get sick of all the guild email about stuff you don&#39;t<br/>
care for and you quit.<br/>
<br/>
EQ-Z: fun to play.  Still quite a challenge but acceptable to the people who<br/>
want to play 2 or 3  hours at a session and still do pretty good.  So they<br/>
make level 50 in 5 months.  And then start a new char of a different class<br/>
or try a char on a Race War team or PvP server.  Things are challenging but<br/>
still fun - not frustration.  So they get this next char to 50 in 3 months.<br/>
And then they decide to start another char and see if they can do it without<br/>
twinking and do some role playing. Now they are good for another couple<br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
Retention rate of your customer base is gonna depend on the fun factor - and<br/>
that will be the &#39;absolute&#39; of all absolutes.  This is after all the<br/>
entertainment business.  When it&#39;s no longer entertaining, you are out of<br/>
business.<br/>

		The problem with adding/removing things purely on the basis<br/>
of<br/>
		&quot;fun&quot; is that for the most part, it looks at only the<br/>
relative<br/>
		side of things (will the players be happier after the change<br/>
		than before?).  Unfortunately, the prisoner&#39;s dilemma and<br/>
		tragedy of the commons are very real, and thus create<br/>
		situations where stuff that makes the players unhappy can be<br/>
		better for the game.</div>
