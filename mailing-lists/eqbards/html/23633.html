<div id="ygrps-yiv-906153723">I&#39;ve always had a problem with our damage shields actually.  Unless you are<br/>
being attacked by multiple mobs, which with an enchanter doesn&#39;t happen too<br/>
often, the damage output of the shields is sub-par.  We have several other<br/>
options which produce more damage per 6 second pulse.  About the only time<br/>
we&#39;ve used the damage shields was in multi-bard groups.  There&#39;s almost<br/>
always a better song to play than a damage shield, heck there probably<br/>
always is a better song unless you&#39;re just wading thru greenies.<br/>

I dont know if I would pick those songs (what level bard? depends on what<br/>
choices were available) but they are not that far off base:<br/>
<br/>
Chains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>
<br/>
Fufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also reduces the mob&#39;s MR<br/>
(if anything, lead with Fufils so next thing sticks better.)<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk and the damage<br/>
shield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>

Heh with my cleric (who normally plays only in his regular group, but with<br/>
my play I have missed several sessions and need to catch up), I was gfrouped<br/>
with a monk and a bard in L Guk (&quot;How long could it take for us to tfind a<br/>
tank, lets get the ass sup camp while we wait&quot;).  The bard was singing the<br/>
oddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no snarer or slower),<br/>
Curtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh????  I suggested<br/>
singing celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>
anything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.  Oddly she was<br/>
quite competent at crowd control.  With Pixie she was keeping 2 mobs at bay<br/>
with no trouble...<br/>
