&gt;     A lot of good ideas here - and of course someone pointed out the<br/>
&gt;expensive heavy spell components for the new Necro summon corpse. Verant<br/>
&gt;explained they feel this is necessary for &quot;balancing&quot; so you can be sure we<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     The Locate+Mellifluous Motion is a nice idea.  Another pipe dream idea I<br/>
&gt;have (which I doubt we&#39;d ever see - considering how lousy the pathing code<br/>
&gt;we already have...  A song for corpse location in dungeons.  Instead of<br/>
&gt;pointing you in a straight line direction to the corpse - it would show you<br/>
&gt;the direction to actually get to the corpse...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally think the real issue is not game balance, but rather, the fear <br/>
that if this ability were given freely, then necros could potentially drag <br/>
corpses of unwitting victims into inconvenient places.<br/>
By making it cost a whole bunch, they lessened the chance of it being used <br/>
as a prank.  Theoretically, you could still do it if you really hated <br/>
someone, but it&#39;d take a whole lot of effort - and they were just trying to <br/>
eliminate the mindless pranks.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the method I have suggested (requiring that you stand <br/>
next to the targeted player, and be within a limited range AND don&#39;t <br/>
actually gain control of it, since it moves to the owner), provides for all <br/>
the same controls, without taking away from the Necro&#39;s ability - after <br/>
all, the Necro can still pull a corpse out of lava from the entrance to <br/>
Lavastorm.  A Bard would have to escort the victim to within a hundred feet <br/>
of the corpse in order to summon it.<br/>
<br/>
Not really abusable, very useful, and similar spell could be given to <br/>
Necro&#39;s at lower levels, giving them something special, too.<br/>
