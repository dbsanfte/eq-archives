<div id="ygrps-yiv-86730890"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to know how you solo&#39;d effectively at<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels 18-22.  For me the few<br/>
&gt; &gt; times I tried it was death unless I could find a<br/>
&gt; &gt; blue &quot;oracle&quot; type caster.<br/>
&gt; &gt; No chains, No fear.  Sure DDD, and CoD do decent<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage but avoiding adds<br/>
&gt; &gt; was impossible nearly at that level range.  Now had<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lullaby been working I<br/>
&gt; &gt; imagine I could have pulled it off, but those levels<br/>
&gt; &gt; were horrific for me<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it was basically:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First off:  At level 18 when I finally got DDD that night I went to the<br/>
cavern in NRO/EC and fired up DDD with my horn and went to bed for the<br/>
night.  When I came home from work the next day my brass skill was maxxed.<br/>
No problems with missed notes from then on.<br/>
<br/>
Level 18 to about 20 or so:<br/>
N. Karana:  Beetles<br/>
DDD/CoD/HoR<br/>
or<br/>
Bellow Kite (ungh slow and painful)<br/>
   ***<br/>
Nektulos:  Some Guards, Corporals, Steel Golems some Stone Golems<br/>
DDD/CoD/HoR running tight circles you could keep the golems just out of<br/>
melee range and just kill them in droves.<br/>
   ***<br/>
Gorge of King Xorbb<br/>
DDD/CoD/HoR<br/>
Muddites, Mino&#39;s (careful on big ones, sometimes had to zone to runnyeye)<br/>
I had hand to hand at 100 since level 14 (I started using it in some groups<br/>
with all-instrument at level 12)<br/>
   ***<br/>
East Karana<br/>
DDD/CoD/HoR<br/>
Lions, Spiders, Gnoll Reavers etc.<br/>
(Pull singles to a zone edge (river, canyon etc) and use all instrument)<br/>
<br/>
Basically there wasn&#39;t anything blue I couldn&#39;t handle if I was careful<br/>
I got about 1.5 bubble of xp per hour.  Went from 18 to 20 in about 3 days<br/>
RL (3 hrs a night or so)<br/>
<br/>
Level 20-24:<br/>
3 Bird spawn in Lakerathe<br/>
East Karana<br/>
South Karana<br/>
North Karana (not griffs)<br/>
<br/>
Same tactic as 18-20 except I added Largo&#39;s melodic Binding to the mix<br/>
DDD/CoD/HoR/LmB<br/>
<br/>
This actually works really well even now at 40.  You can&#39;t do ALL blues with<br/>
it but you can do most blues with it.  It takes them down slowly but surely<br/>
and you can even take multiple low blues (2, MAYBE 3) using this tactic.<br/>
<br/>
I have done this tactic in every zone, including Lower Guk (at 34 or so it<br/>
becomes viable against the entry area of dead side)<br/>
<br/>
Combined with using Lament to pull you can solo anything that cons blue.<br/>
<br/>
At level 26 I don&#39;t think I need to explain how to Fear Kite or how to Charm<br/>
kite at 27.</div>
