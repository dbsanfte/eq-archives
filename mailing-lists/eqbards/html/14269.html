<div id="ygrps-yiv-777340034">I think the big problem is Verant is fixing things we don&#39;t really hear too<br/>
many people asking about and ignoring the things people are asking about.<br/>
we see a fix and wonder who requested that even be looked into when there<br/>
are far bigger fish to fry so to speak.<br/>

It&#39;s getting to be so sad.  When I read the patch message I was happy.  I<br/>
actually said &quot;Yes, finally&quot; out loud to myself.  Then I see the number of<br/>
eqbard emails that are negative and it saddens me.  When did everyone get so<br/>
into complaining all the time?  Every time Verant fixes something someone<br/>
else has to complain.  They nerfed this or now this isnt fair to us.  I<br/>
think everyone should chill.  Verant is made up of PEOPLE.  People arent<br/>
always perfect and I am sure, from being a programmer myself, that they are<br/>
trying there damnest to get things right.  Maybe if everyone wouldnt<br/>
complain about every little nittpicky thing Verant would be more receptive<br/>
when there is a real problem.  And maybe they would be more willing to ask<br/>
for our opinions on what should change.  Instead it seems they always have<br/>
to defend their choices or apologize.  This is a game.  A very fun one at<br/>
that.  When something goes wrong I live with it.  It&#39;s not going to kill me.<br/>
I&#39;ll still be here tomorrow.  I joined this list in the very beginning so<br/>
that I could learn about upcoming levels and have someone to ask questions<br/>
to if I needed.  Now I open my folder and delete, delete, delete, delete.<br/>
Too bad.  Wouldnt it be nice if this were a happier place?<br/>
