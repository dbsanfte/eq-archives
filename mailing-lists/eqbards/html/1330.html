&gt; If that&#39;s the case, then I suppse we DO move faster as we level, because I<br/>
&gt; can move faster than griffawns (im one of the naughty boys that kited them<br/>
&gt; for a bubble at 20), and hill giants, and cyclopses, and lions.  So that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; good news...maybe at lv 50 we can keep up with SoC eh?<br/>

But I distinctly remember a puma keeping up with me with the<br/>
sung version when I was around L8 or so.  I haven&#39;t tried it<br/>
recently as they&#39;re all green to me.<br/>

Those of you who play only a bard may not have noticed that<br/>
giant scarabs and goblins (at least the low-level ones) move<br/>
slower than you can normally run.<br/>
