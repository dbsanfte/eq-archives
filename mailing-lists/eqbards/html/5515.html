&gt;&gt; &gt;Want to hear something really bizarre? I was<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;going through the zone to enter the Keep in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Highpass and when I got through the zone, I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;was at the zone border that goes from Kithicor<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;to Highpass instead of inside the Keep zone. Woops.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Ya got hit with an undocumented feature<br/>
&gt;&gt; him back to his last save point.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The thing is, I didn&#39;t die nor was I being attacked<br/>
&gt;or chased. I was a few bubbles down on health due to<br/>
&gt;a previous fight (that ended) and when I rezoned in<br/>
&gt;the wrong place I was at full health. So that was<br/>
&gt;nifty at least - but at the time of hitting the zone,<br/>
&gt;I was nowhere near death and again, not being attacked.<br/>
<br/>

someone trained on you without you knowing?<br/>
