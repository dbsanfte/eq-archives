<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793111557">Various drolvargs, giants, spiders and chickens in Dreadlands.  I know for<br/>
intelligent mobs you have to tell them to attack every time you charm them.<br/>
In my case they never even attacked the first time I charmed them.<br/>

Which mobs were you trying to charm and in what zones?<br/>

&gt;nothing.  It helps by keeping the mob from attacking us, but I would<br/>
&gt;obviously prefer if he attacked what I told him to.  Need someone who has<br/>
&gt;experience charming with the 39 charm song to tell me what you do to get<br/>
&gt;your pet to attack.  BTW I do not have this problem with the 27 charm song.<br/>
