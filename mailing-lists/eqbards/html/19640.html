<div id="ygrps-yiv-875784424"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The rogue asks the other player why he trained us and his response was that<br/>
since we didn&#39;t help us, he figured we should go down with him.  I was<br/>
floored.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry to hear this happened to you; I&#39;ve been victim of this line of<br/>
thinking too.  In Mistmoore a few levels back, a post 40&#39;s Wizard was<br/>
camping Mynthi and created the nastiest trains I&#39;d seen up to that point.<br/>
We were camped out at the back of the lake, as far as you can get from any<br/>
oncoming trains.  He intentionally ran past us and since myself and the<br/>
Enchanter in the group were alternately using AE songs/spells, the train<br/>
derailed onto us.  A few heated words were exchanged in which he said it was<br/>
his prerogative to run wherever he liked.  Since no-one died that time we<br/>
decided to let it lie and went back to our spot.  Not ten minutes later he<br/>
did it again.  Exactly the same routine and ne&#39;ry a shout of &quot;Train!&quot;  This<br/>
time, however, 4 party members died.  I crossed the zone and found him on<br/>
the other side.  More words were exchanged and he made it clear that he<br/>
thought it was perfectly acceptably to train his pursuers onto us since we&#39;d<br/>
distract a portion of the train long enough to enable him to escape.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s exactly what I was looking for.  /report &lt;lamewizzie&gt; quickly<br/>
followed by /petition.  The foul language that peppered his half-assed<br/>
opinion only served to damn him even further.  The GM I spoke to was kind<br/>
enough to get back to me about a week later and told me that he&#39;d been<br/>
suspended pending a review of similar complaints.<br/>
<br/>
This sort of behaviour is inexcusable.  Just remember to /report<br/>
&lt;playername&gt;  which sends a report to the GMs containing the last 10 lines<br/>
of text in your window and follow it up by a /petition to explain the reason<br/>
for the /report.  The GMs are usually very efficient at dealing with these<br/>
idiots.  The &quot;but I was roleplaying!&quot; excuse never washes with them. ;)<br/>
