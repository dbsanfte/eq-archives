when I hit level 10.  About 4 times I dropped from 10 to 9 again!<br/>

Pointer?  Well, I grouped with a Shadow Knight friend who was 3<br/>
levels above me, and attacked things that conned yellow and red for<br/>
me (white and yellow for her).  Nice xp, even given the uneven<br/>
distribution, but quite dangerous.  <br/>
<br/>
And if you ever find yourself with a group that does not play the<br/>
way you want to, then leave.  And remember their names, so you do<br/>
not do it again!<br/>

group is good.  I find 4 to be OK, but only if I know the majority<br/>
of the group members, and know them to be good at what they do.<br/>
<br/>
Any group larger than 4 that I have ever partied with has ended in<br/>
disaster, one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
All it takes is one stupid person in your group to turn the tide of<br/>
battle against you.  And remember, any mobs that you, as a group,<br/>
attack are going to be annoyed at YOU, for singing heal, or anthem,<br/>
or dissonance (if you are daring).  You need to trust your group <br/>
members to get the monsters off you, and keep them off.<br/>
