Two resist checks, first (.25), second (.33).  If they succeed in<br/>
resisting just one, they must fail the other, so<br/>
<br/>
(.25)*(.67)=(.1675) for a success and failure,<br/>
(.75)*(.33)=(.2475) for a failure and success,<br/>
for a total of (.41) or 41% chance of resisting just one.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, not knowing whether it was a single or double resist, you might<br/>
want to factor in a success and success, that being<br/>
<br/>
(.25)*(.33)=(.0825)<br/>
<br/>
totalling (.4925) or 49.25% chance of resist on a strike with given<br/>
values.<br/>
