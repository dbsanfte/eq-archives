<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-568462218">A new version is out.  You can get it here for now:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/eqreed/BardSongSpreadsheet.html">http://www.geocities.com/eqreed/BardSongSpreadsheet.html</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll be at www.eqsongs.com and www.eqdiva.com shortly.<br/>
<br/>
Changes in this version:<br/>
<br/>
2.03 Cantata (55) Increases Stamina.<br/>
Catanata (34) is effected by an instrument, and is overwritten by the <br/>
55 Cantata.<br/>
Strane (54) should stack with other speed debuffs and snares now <br/>
(greater taking effect).<br/>
Update Comments on Lago&#39;s (51) clarifying stacking.<br/>
Made Strain (54) one line (since strings don&#39;t effect the numbers).<br/>
Added instrument modifers in the selection screen and display.<br/>
Lots of spelling errors.<br/>
Updated the formula of the chant damage to my best guess.<br/>
Added a Mystical lute (the epic) as a modifier is a 2.0 or 2.1 (not <br/>
sure though)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
