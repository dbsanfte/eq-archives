<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136011240">Just had to post this, how&#39;s this for being tight lipped about what is<br/>
really in the patch?<br/>
<br/>

---------------------<br/>
<br/>
After a week of thorough testing, the Summon Corpse spell is now<br/>
functioning properly (we promise!), and available on all servers.  In<br/>
addition, it is now possible to cast Cancel Magic on non-grouped players<br/>
on the PvP and PvP-teams servers.  All changes were made on the<br/>
server-side, therefore no patch is required.  <br/>
<br/>
From everyone on the EverQuest team, and Verant Interactive, we would<br/>
like to wish all of you safe and happy holidays.<br/>
