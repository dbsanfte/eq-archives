&gt; It just doesn&#39;t fit my idea of the classic bard. We are seldom portrayed as<br/>
&gt; tanks. We are singers of songs. Maybe even lifters of purses or players of<br/>
&gt; practical jokes. Light on our feet and quick about our wits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my humble opinion. I try not to tell anyone how to play there<br/>
&gt; character.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally, I feel this is a mistake.  The class of bard in Everquest is NOT<br/>
the wandering Celtic minstrel that people in the SCA love.  They are also not<br/>
folk singers like Joni Mitchell and they are not rock singers.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to roleplay yourself like a &quot;classic&quot; bard, then more power to you,<br/>
but you are really limiting yourself.  The class is designed and balanced to<br/>
use plate, it&#39;s one of the reasons we don&#39;t get double attack or the use of<br/>
bows.<br/>
<br/>
Though I think people who limit their characters for the sake of roleplay are<br/>
cool, like a dwarf who will only use two handed axes, or a rogue who never<br/>
steals for personal reasons, I think that those cases should be rare and<br/>
flavourful rather than the way people SHOULD play.  Otherwise, magicians could<br/>
only saw people in half and pull rabbits out of hats, and that would make them<br/>
really terrible in combat. :)<br/>
