<div id="ygrps-yiv-199513226">I wish all the server GM-heads were as interesting.  I don&#39;t recall hearing<br/>
of anything like this on E&#39;ci.  We&#39;ve had the usual every server events, but<br/>
nothing out of the ordinary.  I&#39;d happily trade for a &quot;nut&quot; right about now.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting how it was a necro that managed to kill one though.  Bet no one<br/>
would have predicted that. ;-)<br/>

&gt; Personally I have had great relations with GMs/Guides.  The only one I<br/>
ever<br/>
&gt; had trouble with was GM-Jagar.  I sure wish GM-Mennix would come back to<br/>
&gt; Karana though :(  Our current GM (DeSani) is kind of a nut though.  He<br/>
keeps<br/>
&gt; showing at after we kill big targets.  On out last Inny kill he paid us a<br/>
&gt; visit as first Inny, then Draco, then we turned into a 6 inch tall human<br/>
&gt; lol.<br/>
<br/>
Last night on Karana, a bunch of Verant folks (led by I assume<br/>
DeSani) were running around as tadpoles attacking people for 1<br/>
point of damage.  They had a ton of hp, and when some necro<br/>
managed to kill one of them, they brought out a huge tadpole<br/>
called the froglok avenger, double-attacking for 100+,<br/>
backstabbing for 400+.  I have a ton of screenshots.<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, DeSani is a nut.  :)  Was a lot of fun to watch,<br/>
although a couple people were killed because they had some<br/>
flags that caused all nearby NPCs to attack anyone who attcked<br/>
them.<br/>
