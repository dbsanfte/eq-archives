<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-194730251">I was wondering if this is a server specific issue also.  I am a lv 23<br/>
bard and last night while kiting a Stone Guardian in Nectulos Forest I was<br/>
experiencing quite a bit of lost notes while singing the standard bellow<br/>
bellow accelerando combo.  In the end I had about 10-12 missed notes on<br/>
the bellow and about 5 on the accelerando.  So here is my info to find out<br/>
if it may be server, or even server group related.  I myself have been<br/>
getting bad server lag spikes.<br/>
<br/>
Lvl 23<br/>
Karana Server<br/>
Wood Elf Bard<br/>
DEX 102<br/>
CHA 96<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this will help us get to the bottom of this.  Now I do wonder if<br/>
casters are experiences differ between varying servers.  I myself have had<br/>
strange increase in fizzles and interrupted spells with my lvl 17<br/>
magician. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Could the missed notes only happens on certain server(s)?  I am a lv 44 bard <br/>
&gt; on Cazic-Thule server, and I haven&#39;t notice any extra missed notes since <br/>
&gt; this thing started.  Not enough to notice it anyway.  Or maybe it only <br/>
&gt; affects wood elf or human bard?  I am a half elf.  Or maybe it is level <br/>
&gt; related?  Seems like a lot of the people who have the missed notes are in <br/>
&gt; their high 20s to high 30s. </span></blockquote></div>
