<b>Subject:</b> Bards and piercing weapons (was  GZ Answers) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034175416">Here is a semi-related topic from this thread.  I was thinking about<br/>
including a condensed version of it in my post I intend to write as part of<br/>
the &quot;ArchMage answers everything bards want to know&quot; thread on the official<br/>
EQ board.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to any of the EQ spoiler sites and look at all the piercing<br/>
weapons in the game, you&#39;ll see that a lot of them are Rogue only.  Now I&#39;m<br/>
a firm believer that every class should have weapons that only they can<br/>
wield, but it seems to me there are a disproportionate number of rogue only<br/>
piercing weapons in the game compared to the actual number of people who<br/>
play rogues.  Lets also take into account how many classes actually use<br/>
piercing weapons.  Other than rogues, bards are about the only other class<br/>
in the game that equip piercing weapons on a regular basis.  A ranger here<br/>
and there may use them but most rangers I see use 1HS weapons.  You almost<br/>
never any other class using them.   <br/>
<br/>
What I would like to see is either: 1) some of the rogue only piercing items<br/>
changed to where bards can equip them or 2) more piercing weapons<br/>
(appropriate for 25-35 level characters) added to the game that a bard can<br/>
equip.  The counter argument is that bards have a wide variety of 1HS, 1HB<br/>
and piercing weapons already in the game that they can use.  True.  But<br/>
since bards and rogues traditionally resemble one another, IMO it only makes<br/>
sense that we can both use the same weapons.  Also, a lot of bards,<br/>
especially those who are wood elves, have a very low Stamina stat.  As a<br/>
result, I prefer to wield light weapons with fast Delay rates to avoid the<br/>
stamina drain.  Most piercing weapons fall into this category.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I smoking crack here thinking there aren&#39;t enough medium level piercing<br/>
weapons in the game for bards to use?<br/>

&gt; &gt; to get numbers for all the non-anonymous players on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; server.  The bard, rogue, and shadowknight have consistently<br/>
&gt; &gt; yielded the lowest numbers on the two servers I play on.<br/>
