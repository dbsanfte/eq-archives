<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604608963">The higher level I&#39;ve gotten, the less twisting I do.   If you are going<br/>
deep into a dungeon you are going to need a well-balanced group.  So your<br/>
role becomes a little less pronounced.  You will still be buffing str, agi,<br/>
attack speed, magic resistance etc.  But for example, in solusek B fighting<br/>
kobolds, the group starts a fight, i go into melee and start beserker<br/>
crescendo and relax =)  It&#39;s actually quite a relief from the many many<br/>
levels of 2 and 3 song twisting.  IF a caster comes, the occasion comes to<br/>
twist beserker and mystic shielding, not too stressful.  Forget the<br/>
bellow/anthem type twist, you are not causing significant damage.  I keep<br/>
bellow memmed for ranged attack and pulling purposes.  A typical fight is<br/>
beserker til mob has one-third life then chain.  Nice and easy and a good<br/>
change of pace.  I could twist like crazy and make the fight better for all,<br/>
but fighting one or two mobs it&#39;s not always necessary.  With 3 or more i<br/>
will probably kick in chords of cessation to slow them all down, but<br/>
basically the point is you do get to relax at higher levels in big groups<br/>
under non-danger fights.  If the fight turns ugly, I will be stacking 3 or 4<br/>
songs to be sure.  You&#39;ve got a good group with a lot of diverse abilities,<br/>
so you can do your best bard thing and not have to worry too much (battle<br/>
song during fight, mana song after).  You don&#39;t have to worry about feeling<br/>
a one-hit wonder with the mana song (a high-level bard friend of mine felt<br/>
this way), because with you around all your tanks fight a lot better, you<br/>
resist magic a lot better, you get all your caster&#39;s mana back a lot faster,<br/>
you chain those runners, and in danger train-type situations, you can save<br/>
the group by fearing, slowing them all down, area effect damage, etc.  But<br/>
on most typical pulls you can relax and give your hand a rest.<br/>

&gt; Depends on whether you&#39;re talking head/eye work or hand/eye <br/>
&gt; twitch speed.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got no problem with concentration.  I do have a problem <br/>
&gt; with having to<br/>
&gt; &quot;work out my wrists&quot; to learn a repeated pattern.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found some other classes to require concentration, so far not the<br/>
&gt; twitchiness of Bards, and yes, with hot keys.  I enjoy having <br/>
&gt; to think in<br/>
&gt; battle.  However, a Bard (unlike other casters) has to twitch <br/>
&gt; to keep up 2<br/>
&gt; buffs/restores even when resting, and twitches to weave a <br/>
&gt; buff/Selo when<br/>
&gt; travelling and twitches insanely if twisting and trying <br/>
&gt; melee.  So while on<br/>
&gt; other casters, my fingers fly for short fight, they then get <br/>
&gt; to rest while<br/>
&gt; the party rests.  On Bards I&#39;m finding thats not so.  Seems party<br/>
&gt; expectations and usefulness are determined by the Bard <br/>
&gt; managing to twist<br/>
&gt; continously.  Some mid-level Bards feel free to tell me if <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wrong .. but<br/>
&gt; this is what I&#39;m reading here.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a carpal tunnel &quot;dodger&quot; with the ergonomic keyboard, <br/>
&gt; trackball mouse<br/>
&gt; & pad, proper height chair .. etc ... and a diagnosable mild <br/>
&gt; coordination<br/>
&gt; problem to boot.  As long as I don&#39;t play &quot;twitch&quot; games <br/>
&gt; (a.k.a. most 1st<br/>
&gt; person shooters) I do fine.  I guess I&#39;ve just been a little <br/>
&gt; surprised by<br/>
&gt; the Bard&#39;s need to twist constantly.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Not only that, I think EVERY class has to do something with <br/>

&gt; &gt;Comparing to real complications, consider a battle cleric, <br/>
&gt; such as played<br/>
&gt; &gt;by a friend of mine and as I&#39;ve tried some myself.  During <br/>
&gt; combat, while<br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;re hitting and perhaps being hit, you have to keep an <br/>
&gt; eye everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;health and if someone is getting too low, target, cast, then <br/>
&gt; return to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;target you were hitting.  Make that worse by using your own <br/>
&gt; damage spells<br/>
&gt; &gt;sometimes, balancing that against potentially vital healing. <br/>
&gt;  And you get<br/>
&gt; &gt;to decide what&#39;s &quot;too low.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Makes playing a bard and twisting songs seem easy.<br/>
