<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286714838">I at first thought DT&#39;s where pretty stupid too, but if you read my<br/>
previous post, i think they where put in for a good reason, and all in all,<br/>
it even makes sense. Armed with this knowledge, we cleared the pof and only<br/>
had to camp out twice from DT&#39;s... where as before we where basically<br/>
getting the dt&#39;s 75% of the time. <br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; what is a DT?  remember, no such thing as a stupid question =)<br/>

&gt;It&#39;s too bad sit ins are a bit overdone now. Does anyone else think<br/>
&gt;random death touches are probably one of the cheeziest cop out design<br/>
&gt;decisions ever made? It reminds me of something a 12 year old playing DM<br/>
&gt;in D&D for the first time would come up with, not something you&#39;d expect<br/>
&gt;from a professional game designer. That and relying on obvious<br/>
&gt;programming flaws like zone in delay and through wall and ceiling agro<br/>
&gt;for their difficulty are probably the things that annoy me most about<br/>
&gt;this game.<br/>
