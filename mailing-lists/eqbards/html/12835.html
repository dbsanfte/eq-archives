<div id="ygrps-yiv-428013538">Conversely, this weekend on a PoH trip, I had the unique chance<br/>
  to use pixie strike a little with another bard.<br/>
<br/>
  I was getting solid resists, 0% success vs. a loathing lich.<br/>
  That is until I put my new flute on, which gave 100% success<br/>
  against the lich.  Which was long enough for everyone to camp<br/>
  out (we had just been rez&#39;d in and werent ready to fight) and<br/>
  then I pulled out my yk&#39;s and proceeded to lay the smack down<br/>
  until it triple 135&#39;d me, heh good sacrific tho.  Me and the<br/>
  other bard were the only ones to die for the cause.<br/>
<br/>
  This was the test I had been missing, which I stated before.<br/>
  A comparable level mob vs a bard, the flute makes a difference<br/>
  assuming it doesn&#39;t have ridiculously high magic resist.  If<br/>
  we could charm things over L37, I would assume the flute would<br/>
  make a difference, but as it is the flute doesn&#39;t do anything <br/>
  for me because I rarely get resisted by a L37 or lower mob.<br/>
<br/>
  So I eat my words about pixie/charm and the flute vs. comparable<br/>
  level mobs.  If you are 12+ levels over a mob, your flute does<br/>
  absolutely nothing however as you become just too buff for any<br/>
  mob to resist more than the standard 5%.<br/>
<br/>
  We need to L30s people to test out pixie and charm in the future, <br/>
  since the L50s aren&#39;t gonna find a L50 creature that isn&#39;t buffed <br/>
  out the yang for MR.  (except maybe the dino in oot, even then we <br/>
  cannot charm him).  ;)   <br/>
