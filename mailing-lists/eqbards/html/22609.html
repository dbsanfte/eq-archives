<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027877102">I was surprised this weekend when my Singing and Percussion went up to about 203+...I thought the caps would only be increased for those above level 50 just like casting caps, but I guess not (I&#39;m level 42).<br/>

P.S.  My normal group &quot;did&quot; Temple of Droga last night...we just walked everywhere and killed anything that we could see.  That is an amazing zone with beautiful architecture (and good exp for the three of us that could get it from the gobbies :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I heard it was 225.  Got singing to 206 last night, and Percussion to 202.  And Offense went up, I believe<br/>
to 201, although I was busy at the time.  :)<br/>
