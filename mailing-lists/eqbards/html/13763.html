<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982179317">I agree that we should /petition it, but it wasn&#39;t really a case of, &quot;Let&#39;s fix<br/>
the Bard animation, rather than work on a different Bard issue...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a blanket animation change that affected all character animations.  The<br/>
animation code for for the models is the same for all model types it&#39;s applied<br/>
to. So, all PC&#39;s use the same &#39;run&#39; animation tree.  When you fix the tree so<br/>
that the legs aren&#39;t immobile during the &#39;run&#39; + &#39;spell&#39; branch, you fix it for<br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It just ended up with a bad combo for us, since our animation speed is so<br/>
different from the rest of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
We should be aware that it wasn&#39;t a Bard change, it was a global change that had<br/>
a negative impact on our animation.<br/>

P.S. I wish you guys wanted to push to have us reclassified as casters...I&#39;d<br/>
love to drop the exp penalty for being a Hybrid....Since I fight like a Cleric<br/>
and all...<br/>
