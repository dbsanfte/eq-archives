<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539099875">Heh, some bloke did that in L Guk the other night. Had the whole zone in<br/>
/shout mode, apparently the TBB had dropped and the group was rolling on<br/>
the loot when the corpse disappeared and the guy went LD, this went on for<br/>
about 30 minutes and it was all a big farce, it all sounds dodgy.<br/>

  Seriously, that wizard doesnt have arms/legs, no melee class<br/>
  would ever bring that wizard anywhere if he did manage to take<br/>
  them, or maybe he ninja&#39;d them.  Brrr..  that&#39;s a scary thought.<br/>
