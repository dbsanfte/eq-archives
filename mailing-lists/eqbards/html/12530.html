<div id="ygrps-yiv-471902130">These are the most fun raids.  Small groups like this tend to be more<br/>
efficient than organized.  The challenge and the desire to avoid even a<br/>
single mistake make these the most fun moments in the game.  So far the<br/>
smallest group we&#39;ve taken is 10, with no casualties.  I&#39;m thinking its<br/>
doable with 6.<br/>

our normal FG raids are 12 ppl and easily done.  just takes good teamwork<br/>
and the right class balance, which i know you are good at Harm.  you&#39;ll be<br/>
able to do it with 12 level 50s easy.<br/>
