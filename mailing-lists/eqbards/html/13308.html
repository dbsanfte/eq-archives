&gt;The other day I was in Cazic deep in the sewers with a pretty good pickup<br/>
&gt;group.  I was the lowest at 31st level.  We only had five people in the<br/>
&gt;group so when a 34 necro shouted he wanted to join a party I told him we<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a spot.  When the necro joined the party, he told us that that he had<br/>
 </span></blockquote>almost<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;no experience fighting in groups before.  He stated that he had soloed all<br/>
&gt;the way from 1st level to 34th level and only had 10 days played time.  He<br/>
&gt;stated that only now since he was at 34th did he find it necessary to join<br/>
&gt;groups to get good EXP.  I have heard that necros were the best at soloing<br/>
&gt;so I had trouble believing what he said.  I am 31st level with 29 days<br/>
&gt;played time.  A friend of mine is a 36 enchanter with 50 days played time.<br/>
&gt;Someone in the party asked him if he had friends that helped him powerlevel<br/>
&gt;to 34th.  He said that he had done it all by himself and that he just knew<br/>
&gt;the right places to camp.  Does this sound credible that a necro can solo<br/>
