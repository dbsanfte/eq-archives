 </span></blockquote>Kind of off-topic, but I know all our human and half-elf<br/>
compatriots are eagerly looking for this stuff.  We got our<br/>
first piece of medium bronze last night.  It was off a L25<br/>
goblin we pulled from deep in the cave system past the<br/>
Archeologist.  That would put it at roughly the same level as<br/>
the dry bones and nobles that most often drop small bronze in<br/>
Unrest; except that everything trains in Permafrost and you<br/>
can&#39;t use Accelerando/SoW, thus requiring a much higher level<br/>
group to survive there, much less get this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We finished the night with the puller telling us &quot;ZONE&quot;,<br/>
shouting &quot;TRAIN&quot;, and running by us with about 15-20 goblins<br/>
behind him (half of whom got caught in my lullaby because I&#39;d<br/>
missed the original &quot;ZONE&quot; message).  Ouch.  Screech saved my<br/>
butt, barely.  Scrolling back, I saw 6 simultaneous &quot;flees in<br/>
terror&quot; messages, so it appears Screech is not limited to 4<br/>
targets either.<br/>
<br/>
I also had a lot of fun in Everfrost charming mammoths and<br/>
making them attack mammoth calves.  A lot of folks were doing<br/>
double takes when they saw that.  :-)<br/>
