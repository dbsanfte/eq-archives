I think that we should have a cap on some of our skills for class balance<br/>
purposes.  However, I think I speak for the majority of this list that the<br/>
current caps are too low and hence worthless for some of the skills.  If you<br/>
look at the adjectives describing the skill levels, you see the terms awful,<br/>
bad, poor, good, etc all the way up to master.  Off the top of my head I&#39;m<br/>
not sure what numerical skill level is required to get a master rating but I<br/>
think its around 100 (+/- a few).  Since we are &quot;masters of none&quot;, you would<br/>
think that with our secondary skills (non combat/bard skills like hide,<br/>
forage, sneak, etc) we could at least reach a skill level in some of them<br/>
that brings us up to the numerical equivalent of the Very Good/Excellent<br/>
rating (or whatever the adjective is immediately before Master).<br/>
