<b>Subject:</b> Re: Jig and Mana Regeneration - long hypothesis <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443373906">Interesting theory, post anything you find.  One bard I spoke to claimed to<br/>
have tested Jig and that it would help mana regeneration with a drum but had<br/>
no effect without!  Either sung or played Jig would short-out the<br/>
meditation, in such a case, but perhaps she was just lying.<br/>
<br/>
If your theory is true, two bards playing Jig timed just right could wreak<br/>
some havok.  And what if a mage tried to meditate with four bards playing<br/>
jigs.  Could he ever even concentrate?  Hehhe.<br/>

&gt;Hey all...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Haven&#39;t had time to get a mage to stopwatch this, but will try soon...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My understanding of the way this works is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meditate works on an 8 or 9 second &#39;pulse&#39;, and regens mana accordingly.<br/>
&gt;Jig works on a 6 second (maybe 5 at higher levels, again I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;stopwatched this)<br/>
&gt;When playing Jig, each pulse &#39;shorts out&#39; the counter on the meditate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pulse.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This causes meditate to operate at 6 second intervals instead of 8 or 9,<br/>
&gt;thus increasing the amount of mana regeneration.  Also, playing Hymn of<br/>
&gt;Restoration (which I think is 6 or 7 seconds) should do the same thing, but<br/>
&gt;at a slower rate, since I think it&#39;s a bit slower on the pulses (could be<br/>
&gt;wrong).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll try to get one of the mages in my guild to help me try this before<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;weekend, and see what the real effects are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Incidentally, if this is truly what is happening, it is probably a.) a bug,<br/>
&gt;and b.) will not work for bard mana regen if we don&#39;t have meditate skill.<br/>
&gt;It also means that a level 3 bard, with jig could group with a level 50<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mana<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;user, and cause the same, or almost the same, effect that any higher level<br/>
&gt;bard could provide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It would probably be best if multiple people did independent tests, so that<br/>
&gt;we don&#39;t skew the results.  So, any volunteers out there can test this.<br/>
&gt;This is the method that I&#39;ll use...<br/>
&gt;Have the mage expend *ALL* of his/her mana.  Time each pulse of medi, as<br/>
&gt;well as length of time to regen.  Again have the mage expend all mana.<br/>
&gt;Playing jig, time pulse of medi, time pulse of jig, and length of time to<br/>
&gt;full regen.  Playing HoR, time pulse of medi, HOR, and total.  This should<br/>
&gt;give definite results on timing, percentage gained, if any, etc. and so on.<br/>
&gt;Please post results here, if you try this.<br/>
