<div id="ygrps-yiv-297321030">I used to agree totally.  Things happen that change your playing style,<br/>
though.  For me, it happened when I got some vambraces off Ragefire.<br/>
They&#39;re too ugly to wear despite incredible stats, but they cast a<br/>
targetable 9 point damage shield (instant right click cast, like jboots),<br/>
that stacks with psalm of cooling.<br/>
<br/>
While I wasn&#39;t really willing to sing a song for a 9 point shield, I became<br/>
willing to sing it for an 18 point one.<br/>

&gt; I dont know if I would pick those songs (what level bard? depends on what<br/>
&gt; choices were available) but they are not that far off base:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also reduces the mob&#39;s<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (if anything, lead with Fufils so next thing sticks better.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Psalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk and the damage<br/>
&gt; shield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a thought,<br/>
