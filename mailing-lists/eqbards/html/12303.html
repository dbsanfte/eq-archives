<div id="ygrps-yiv-168702041">Entirely possible that its random, or at least has a random component.  That<br/>
would not surprise me in the least as I know for sure I have died multiple<br/>
times at the same level to the exact same mob, not a respawn, the exact same<br/>
mob, and lost visually different xp.  More difference than a pixel rounding<br/>
would allow I&#39;m fairly certain.<br/>

      I get a chuckle with people trying to come up with elaborate theories<br/>
relating to the experience loss on death.  We all forget Occum&#39;s Razor (the<br/>
simplest explanation is probably the correct one).  Sounds to me that it&#39;s<br/>
completely random...<br/>
