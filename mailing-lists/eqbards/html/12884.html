&gt; &gt; All of these add up to a class, that when over 38th level becomes a <br/>
&gt;magic resist buffing mana pump.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to disagree with you, and go through our songs to show that they<br/>
&gt;are, on the whole, just as effective before as after 38, in many<br/>
&gt;circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right on! My tactics many times are the difference between whether my group <br/>
is successful or dies in big globby messes. I take pride in the fact that I <br/>
can do just about anything that needs to be done to make my group successful <br/>
(almost no matter the makeup of the group). Give me a bard and a cleric and <br/>
4 others of any class all level 41 or higher and I can break the spawn in <br/>
the Lord room and hold the room successfully until the group breaks up.  <br/>
Give me 3 others all 45+ and the same holds true. Any group can come up with <br/>
the tactics but you need an enchanter for mezz (or a bard) or a monk/sk for <br/>
feign pull (or a bard).<br/>
<br/>
No other class can compliment a group no matter the makeup as well as a bard <br/>
can. I do want to disagree on one point though.<br/>

&gt;Dirge is somewhat of a joke.  My first test of it was on a Freeport guard,<br/>
&gt;it did a whopping 44 points of damage for 4.5 bubbles of mana.  Nice<br/>
&gt;thought, but impractical overall, especially when it takes up a rather<br/>
&gt;crucial song slot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try the dirge on something that doesn&#39;t have a 600 magic resist (IOW, a non <br/>
guard).  This song is VERY useful in the right circumstances.  If you have <br/>
an enchanter, on a fight that could be a little tough, open the fight with <br/>
this. Sure you are going to get beat on by the extras, but the enchanter <br/>
fixes that pretty quickly.  On a fight where you are fighting one big meany <br/>
every 38 minutes who has 10,000 hot points, an extra 321 or so isn&#39;t so <br/>
shabby, especially since if you can sit between fights you can regen enough <br/>
mana to use it again the next time he spawns! You want to be the hero and <br/>
save your party from certain death? If fear isn&#39;t cutting it, use the dirge. <br/>
Yeah, you will almost certainly die but your party will have time to make a <br/>
clean run for it while all the mobs finish you off. Its a handy little song, <br/>
you just gotta know the ways to use it.<br/>
<br/>
You will sometimes hear me griping about my abilities, but almost always its <br/>
in jest (except for the false non-resists on lullaby and pixie, that really <br/>
really irritates me).  You will never hear me griping about how a bard is <br/>
underpowered, how a bard is a wimp, how a bard is &lt;fill in the negative <br/>
blank&gt; though. I know that if I can get my party on the same page as me, I <br/>
can control any battle to the point that we can be successful. I know that <br/>
there are only two duels I fear, a like levelled enchanter or higher and a <br/>
like levelled bard or higher. I&#39;ve stomped all other comers in duels, not <br/>
because I&#39;m that good, but because if you play a bard to its full potential, <br/>
you can be one of the most powerful players in the game!<br/>
