 </span></blockquote>An easier way I found by accident: there&#39;s a tree in West Freeport, North of <br/>
the Monk&#39;s Guild, right by one of the walls (it&#39;s close to the stage that <br/>
fills the corner of that square).  If you climb to the top and leap, you can <br/>
just reach the wall.  By running and leaping, you can get around to most of <br/>
the city walls and rooftops.  The graphics there are unfinished, and I have <br/>
a nice overhead shot of me standing on the wall watching the moon rise <br/>
BENEATH me - a bit vertiginous, that.<br/>
<br/>
OK, ok, I climb a lot, just to see what&#39;s up there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether this is possible for you non-woodelves or not.  My <br/>
friend Bayrn, a high-elf cleric, tried over and over but couldn&#39;t climb to <br/>
the top of the tree.  I wonder whether we woodelves actually are better at <br/>
climbing trees? = )<br/>
