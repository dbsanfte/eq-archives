<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265851515">as others have said, enchanter OR bard is sought a lot in high-level kunark<br/>
zones.  you really do need one or the other to effectively hold camps and<br/>
stay alive.<br/>
<br/>
and as far as grouping with an enchanter, i absolutely love it.  my fingers<br/>
are frickin killing me!  give me an enchanter and let them do all the work,<br/>
i wanna rest and play mana song all day long, and hey if there is no<br/>
enchanter around, i&#39;ll do everything they can &quot;almost&quot; as good =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; It all comes down to the same problem really.  A bard is an <br/>
&gt; awesome way to<br/>
&gt; make up for the lack of having a particular type of caster in <br/>
&gt; your group<br/>
&gt; whatever that missing type might be.  If you have all the major types<br/>
&gt; covered though, we look like lousy psuedo-tanks with some interesting<br/>
&gt; secondary abilities.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It goes back to my previous bard complaint from way back, <br/>
&gt; being a third rate<br/>
&gt; everything does not necessarily balance out with being best <br/>
&gt; at something.<br/>
&gt; If there was a better balance between casters and melee <br/>
&gt; classes in EQ we<br/>
&gt; would instantly become more useful as any given group would <br/>
&gt; be more likely<br/>
&gt; to be missing some type they needed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When was the last time you entered a zone to see shouts of <br/>
&gt; &quot;Bard wanted for<br/>
&gt; group&quot;?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d answer never.  Every time I play I see &quot;Cleric needed for <br/>
&gt; group&quot;, or<br/>
&gt; &quot;Enchanter needed for group&quot;, or &quot;2 Tanks needed for group&quot;.  <br/>
&gt; I may not get<br/>
&gt; refused by groups but the first question is always &quot;Do you <br/>
&gt; have manasong?&quot;<br/>
&gt; (I play Anon)  The response is always &quot;Oh.  Darn&quot;.  If <br/>
&gt; Lullaby worked even<br/>
&gt; marginally I&#39;d start ansewring those &quot;enchanter wanted&quot; <br/>
&gt; shouts and see if<br/>
&gt; they were really &quot;Clarity wanted&quot;.<br/>
