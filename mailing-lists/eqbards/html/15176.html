and should not settle.  Why bards are a lower priority than other classes, I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
And they have continually said that our 4 songs were planned to go in with<br/>
the Expansion with a hint of throwing one in sooner.  So, we are ahead 1<br/>
song by 2 months.  I guess I don&#39;t understand the lower priority comment.<br/>
Disregarding the somewhat evasive answers, is there any other class who got<br/>
a sole Archmage Answers dedicated to them?  Or that got GZ to test things in<br/>
person with?  Did we not get new quest armor at the same time as most other<br/>
classes?  Did we not get a whole slew of improvements (at least as far as<br/>
the patch message was concerned) last patch?  I really don&#39;t see how we&#39;re<br/>
treated as lower priority.  One question I do have.. if they wanted us to<br/>
get something new with the expansion, are we not getting 10 new songs for<br/>
level 51 - 60?<br/>

Abashi is absolutely right... They do get less rants when they nerf!<br/>
