<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516366899">This is very common. The first thing I tell newbies in EQ to do is to move that &quot;a&quot; binding<br/>
somewhere else (I use ~).<br/>
<br/>
In beta, the day they changed the overall bindings (attack used to be Z and X -- yes, you had to<br/>
start swinging with both arms) there were dead bodies everywhere.  My own demise came when I<br/>
asked Marshall Goobler, &quot;Am I one with the wall?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or more accurately, &quot;Am...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After running back to Rivervale (I was bound in Freeport at the time, and just wanted to see how<br/>
I was doing in the quest as I went through Rivervale), I was pleased/horrified to see that there<br/>
were at least 3 other bodies on the ground near mine.<br/>
