<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775320969">I think that&#39;s how quite a few people play.  You can&#39;t keep playing if<br/>
you are not enjoying yourself.  But the way I see it once you hit 60<br/>
there is nowhere to go, especially for the people who hit 60 early and<br/>
have been 60 for a year now.  There is only so much boring 6-man camping<br/>
you can do in seb/HS/velks (or solb/lguk before kunark).  The only thing<br/>
left, and the only reason I see to get to 60, is raids.  You are 56, you<br/>
have a lot of exp&#39;ing left to do.  I was 59, and I did too, and I loved<br/>
the break from raids just to play in a 6-man group.  But why was I in<br/>
the group exp&#39;ing?  To get to 60, and be more of an asset on raids.  Not<br/>
to be the best, but because that was what I enjoyed and why I was<br/>
playing.  Now I play to talk to friends while I kill a few things,<br/>
because I don&#39;t necessarily enjoy raids but moreso I do not have the<br/>
time.<br/>

Sometimes I think people are too worried about being the &quot;best&quot; or<br/>
contributing the &quot;most&quot; to any given group.  You know what I really<br/>
enjoy?<br/>
Playing with 6 smart people that know how to play.  Doesnt matter the<br/>
class.<br/>
Or doing a raid with 3 or 4 groups of friends that you enjoy playing<br/>
with.<br/>
Thats me though...<br/>
