&gt;Since you seem to have a lot of experience &lt;g&gt;...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is the best way to get out of level 35?  I have been level 35 for a<br/>
&gt;week now and my group is power leveling away from me.  I need to get thru<br/>
&gt;this hell level a.s.a.p.!  Help!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Go to Cazic, go directly to Cazic, do not pass go, do not collect 200 plat 8).  In a<br/>
non-hell level (I think 36) I did 4 bubbles in one long evening there.  I recommend<br/>
the upper zig.  You do have to separate from your usual group because of the list<br/>
system (at least on Mith Marr) but man the experience is great and the cash and fine<br/>
steel are good.<br/>
<br/>
Invis to run up.  Chains and battle songs for melee mobs.  Pixie strike to interrupt<br/>
the casters.  Mana song afterwards.  And finally levitate to jump right off the top<br/>
and float down afterwards ;P.  They will love you Sylly.<br/>
