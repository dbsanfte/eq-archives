<div id="ygrps-yiv-416794164">Since you are hanging out in Guk, try to get your hands on the dark elf hide<br/>
gloves and the troll-hide belt.  They are bard/rogue only so the demand isn&#39;t as<br/>
high for them.  Those two will give you ten more points to your STR.  After I<br/>
got those two items I was able to start wearing bronze plate and still have room<br/>
to carry stuff.  My base STR is 76 and with items is now 100.  Another option is<br/>
the Blackened Iron Crown in Runnyeye. I think it also adds five points to STR<br/>
plus bonuses to resists.  For weapons, thulian claws seem to be the bard weapon<br/>
of choice for those in their 20s and will cost around 400PP.<br/>

&gt; Hail all!<br/>
&gt; After my latest adventure grouping with our guilds new wizard in cleri&#39;c<br/>
&gt; clothing I decided to foray off and try my hand at soloing once more.  I<br/>
&gt; have journeyed to far off Upper Guk where I have been taking on the Heart<br/>
&gt; Spiders found there.  The experience has thus far been most fruitful both in<br/>
&gt; terms of silks and xp.  While I died 4 times the first nite, my ping was at<br/>
&gt; an all time record low (for me) and I was able to make it back to my body in<br/>
&gt; 27 minutes!  I have found my experience bar moving steadily upward and<br/>
&gt; expect to make 18th level tonite.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question is this?  What sort of equipment should I start looking for at<br/>
&gt; my level to help improve my performance.  A lot of the equipment I have now<br/>
&gt; is already better than I could get on my own as my trade skills have<br/>
&gt; actually been profitable!  Sssshhh... don&#39;t tell Verant.  I&#39;m thinking what<br/>
&gt; I need most is a primary weapon upgrade, I am currently alternating between<br/>
&gt; a Dragoon Dirk and a Screaming Mace as primary.  I have about 250pp, but can<br/>
&gt; easily make another 100-200 by selling cured silk this week.  I welcome any<br/>
&gt; suggestions that don&#39;t require me to carry a stupid axe ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think my armor is as good as it will be for a while, except maybe for my<br/>
&gt; helm.  I have Barbed Arms and legs, Crush tunic, Bloodstained Mantle,<br/>
&gt; Bearskin Boots, a sleek black cape, Leatherfoot Raider&#39;s helm, 2 jagged<br/>
&gt; bands, bracer of erolissi, silver-plated bracer, purity belt (still?),<br/>
&gt; electrum pearl necklace (upgrade to gold?).  I use a chitin shell shield or<br/>
&gt; dual wield depending on the situation.  Any ideas what armor upgrades I<br/>
&gt; could get without bumping my weight up too much?  I&#39;m a natural weakling<br/>
&gt; (Str73) so have concentrated on stat boosting armor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Thanks for the input!<br/>
