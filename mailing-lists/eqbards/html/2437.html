 </span></blockquote>L39 is the super overkill song and spell effect level. Almost everyone I<br/>
know has particle density off now for dungeons, because between spell<br/>
effects and songs in close quarters in dungeon, your video slows to a<br/>
crawl.<br/>
<br/>
The effects look cool, a party with a bard playing multiple songs looks<br/>
like one of those lit up ornamental fountains in front of some public<br/>
buildings. But my P2 400 and voodoo2 card dont like them much and I<br/>
haven&#39;t run across anyone else who doesn&#39;t say it slows them down too.<br/>
