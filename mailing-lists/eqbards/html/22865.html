<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772718883">Our Eye of Zomm is pretty short duration, maybe 30 seconds.  Long enough to be really irritating (since<br/>
I&#39;ve never figured out how to get unlocked from the Eye when I need to), but too short to be useful.<br/>
Besides, everyone I know kills Eyes on sight.  There&#39;s something atavistically pleasant about killing<br/>
things with one blow, apparently.<br/>

&gt; 1) Turn on song.<br/>
&gt; 2) Summon Eye<br/>
&gt; 3) Put Eye directly in front of you, facing directly away.<br/>
&gt; 4) Move Eye in a straight line...<br/>

&gt; It might not be so useful in tree-infested areas, though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;What about if you have a SS helm and summon the Eye of Zomm?  Can you summon<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the Eye, turn on the corpse locating song, and then lead the person to their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;corpse with the Eye instead of going yourself?  This could be useful in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;situations when you don&#39;t want to leave your party.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Neat idea. I&#39;d guess that this wouldn&#39;t work, but who knows. Any idea what<br/>
&gt; &gt;the duration is of Eye of Zomm from the helm? I know my magician&#39;s Eye of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Zomm has a very short duration. Not sure it&#39;d stay around long enough to<br/>
&gt; &gt;help someone locate their corpse.<br/>
