The problem for me is being stunned. I&#39;ll mash my NumLock key to start<br/>
running, switch to my hotkey bank that holds my meelee and inv slots and<br/>
start swapping, all the sudden I&#39;m not running anymore and/or my Selo&#39;s has<br/>
been ended. Now I have either stand still and finish swapping weapon &<br/>
shield for an instrument or I have to mash the NumLock again, switch back to<br/>
my songs hotkey bank, hit Selo&#39;s (several times lately before it works),<br/>
switch back to my slots bank, finish swapping items and hope I&#39;m still alive<br/>
in the time that it took to do the above. <br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This happened to me all of the time.  To solve it, I put Selo&#39;s into the #6<br/>
spot on my inventory hotkey bank.  If I get stunned or Selo&#39;s stops whilst I<br/>
am trying to switch to the drum, I just hit &quot;numlock&quot; to start running, &quot;6&quot;<br/>
to get Selo&#39;s going, and then try to complete the weapon/drum switch -- none<br/>
of that &quot;shift-X&quot; crap is needed to switch hotkey banks.<br/>
