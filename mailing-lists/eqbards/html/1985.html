<div id="ygrps-yiv-819836321">i am wondering how you got the lute, it comes off the named gypsy in<br/>
mistmoore, and i died getting it at level 40.  i could not discern any<br/>
special effects either, so i am just holding on to it.  i heard she also<br/>
drops battle drums, which are supposed to be better than our normal hand<br/>
drum, though i do not have one to test.  but i would certainly not sell it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello there all! I have a few questions that arose during my adventure<br/>
&gt; today....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) I have a Lute called &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; or <br/>
&gt; something like that.<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know if it has any significance? Is it just a <br/>
&gt; quest item? I<br/>
&gt; tried using it, and it works in all respects (that I could <br/>
&gt; tell) like a<br/>
&gt; normal Lute. Nothing special. I did notice that I could sell <br/>
&gt; it for almost 4<br/>
&gt; plat, where a normal lute doesn&#39;t make it to 1 plat. Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) I also just picked up &quot;Lisera&quot;, a lute that a bard in Qeynos needs<br/>
&gt; tuning. He says that I need to take it to someone named <br/>
&gt; Nostrolo in the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Karanas&quot;. But, I looked and looked and could not FINFD This Nostrolo<br/>
&gt; person. Is this a broken quest, or have I just missed this <br/>
&gt; fella? Could<br/>
&gt; someone give me an idea where to look for Nostrolo? Also, is <br/>
&gt; Lisera a lute<br/>
&gt; you should KEEP, meaning is IT better than a regular Lute?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) Does anyone know of a site that has descriptions of what <br/>
&gt; songs do above<br/>
&gt; 24th level??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for all your help!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
