  Probably not. We&#39;d really like to see bards actively played, rather<br/>
  than passivly sitting there after typing one command. The more<br/>
  dexterous the person behind the keyboard is the more benefit that a<br/>
  bard can impart to the party. A person who can compose a song of 3<br/>
  different melodies and change instruments at the same time is a<br/>
  formidable bard indeed<br/>
<br/>
  *SIGH*  Sounds like it was forgotten that a larg population of EQ players<br/>
are not American!  ON a good day here in Australia I can keep almost 3 songs<br/>
going.  But one will drop before I can start again.  When connecting from<br/>
half way across the world I have plenty of time to pick up lag.  And the<br/>
best time!  is a 8pm to midnight my time when there&#39;s about 600 players on<br/>
the whole server.  *SIGH*  So no matter how good the person behind the<br/>
keyboard is lag will still play a role in it.  But then that&#39;s a rather<br/>
narrow focus if they have forgotten those outside of North America in<br/>
this...<br/>
