&gt; Hmmm, one chant is missing here?  I am guessing you say both CoFl and CoFr<br/>
&gt; doing 48 dmg?<br/>

I should try grouping with Rokenn and see what we can do<br/>
together.  CoFr+CoF+FCC w/ Selo&#39;s drum = 28.2 damage/sec,<br/>
Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD w/ Kelin&#39;s lute = 16.3 damage/sec and<br/>
healing 38 hp(?)/6 sec.  Total would be 44.5 damage/sec (equal<br/>
to 5 bards meleeing :), healing 6.3 hp/sec.<br/>
<br/>
The resist debuffs from the Chants are nice too.  We weren&#39;t<br/>
taking much damage so I told the cleric to nuke whenever he<br/>
saw the &quot;hair stands on end&quot; message.  He reported only about<br/>
1 in 5 wraths were being resisted, and most were hitting for<br/>
full damage, despite most of the seafuries being red to him<br/>
(a few were yellow).<br/>
