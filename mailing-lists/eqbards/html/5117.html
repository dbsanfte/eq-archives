<div id="ygrps-yiv-171141145">I ama lvl 37 Bard, so its definitley not level related. I also had that<br/>
problem you speak of with the Brass based songs, thats what I think this<br/>
patch &quot;fixed&quot;, unfortunately it nerfed all the songs now, thus the missed<br/>
notes on songs I learned 30 levels ago. Prior to this patch missing a note<br/>
on even the level 23 song was unheard of, let alone Selo. With a class that<br/>
requires the twisting of songs during battle I am sure we are dying from<br/>
this.<br/>

&gt; You must need incredible Dex then because my base is 124 and with a Shaman<br/>
&gt; buff it is 161, I still miss alot of notes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This could well be.  I don&#39;t claim to be absolutely correct on this, but I<br/>
think dexterity also has more face validity than charisma does when it comes<br/>
to<br/>
whether you miss a note.<br/>
<br/>
Also note that the frequency of missed notes depends on how long you have<br/>
had<br/>
the song in question.  When I first tried playing chords of dissonance with<br/>
a<br/>
horn, the missed notes were just unbelievable.  I was like a junior high<br/>
school<br/>
band.  :)<br/>
