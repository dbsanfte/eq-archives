&gt; &gt;you sound like you hate EQ and bards in specific.  Seriously, if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;want to do crowd control why the hell do you care if Lullaby works at all?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want to do just crowd control.  I like the bard class because we can<br/>
&gt;do so many different things that I don&#39;t get bored by doing the same old<br/>
&gt;thing every night.  That&#39;s probably why I don&#39;t like grouping with<br/>
&gt;enchanters, it takes away almost all of my tactical options.  With<br/>
&gt;enchanters I feel like I get pigeon holed into one single role, and it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;one I feel bards are best suited to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it hardly takes away &#39;&#39;almost all of your tactical options&#39;&#39;.  you seem to blame enchanters<br/>
for a lot of your feelings of inadequacy.  well, why weren&#39;t you chaining.  oh you had a ranger.<br/>
well, what does that have to do with the enchanter, or casters at all for that matter?  there were<br/>
a few different options that people on this board suggested in terms of tactics, but you seem to<br/>
either dislike them, or think they aren&#39;t good enough, or maybe you just ignored them, i dunno.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Lullaby with just a Lute would be just as useless as it is now.  It would<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; cool for saving newbies from a train in Blackburrow, but pointless in<br/>
&gt;normal<br/>
&gt; &gt; combat situations.  Unless you want to just stand there and play just<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lullaby while the rest of the group actually fights.  That&#39;s why my<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter is just gathering dust, I found I don;t want to just stand (err<br/>
&gt; &gt; sit) there and Mez until someone needs Quickness or Breeze refreshed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>umm, it would be pointless in normal combat situations?  why? cuz you can&#39;t<br/>
swing weapons?  maybe you *would* be more suited for the role of a real tank<br/>
instead of a bard.<br/>
