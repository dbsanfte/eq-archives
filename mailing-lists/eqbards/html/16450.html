&gt; So basically Chains is like bards in general?  An afterthought that&#39;s nice<br/>
&gt; to have when the real spells fail.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I get a strong idea that GZ&#39;s well ran dry on song ideas somewhere just<br/>
after L20. Chains could have been a great song if it was _only_ a<br/>
targetted mob combat speed reducer. That way it wouldn&#39;t conflict with<br/>
snare and cause these headaches. Then he could have added another snare<br/>
song as a seperate song, for those occasions when you don&#39;t have a druid<br/>
or ranger. But no, GZ seems real big on these multiple action songs that<br/>
get resisted more and also conflict more with other class&#39;s spells.<br/>
<br/>
Same with the magic resist debuffs. A straight debuff would have been<br/>
fine, but he had to add the dot which uses the same resist, so the songs<br/>
become effectively useless. Having magic, fire, and cold debuff songs<br/>
that tested on poison like tashan wouldn&#39;t have been that unbalancing or<br/>
intruding on the classes that get debuffs, considering how little they<br/>
debuff and the level the bard gets them at, but instead we got 3 songs<br/>
that no one ever uses.<br/>
