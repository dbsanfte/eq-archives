&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hopefully this gives you some insight into how tricky designing some items <br/>
&gt; can be. It&#39;s both an art and a science -- you have to have an intuitive feel <br/>
&gt; for the interactions between everything (race, procs, stat bonuses, classes, <br/>
&gt; skill caps, etc.) and then you have to back up your gut instincts by running <br/>
&gt; simulations so that the numbers do, in fact, add up to what you expect. Then <br/>
&gt; you have to see how it all fits into the world with regards to real world <br/>
&gt; usefulness (is that proc really relevant? Do these races really use this? Is <br/>
&gt; there another weapon that&#39;s similar and easier to get?) and hope you made <br/>
&gt; the right decision.<br/>

  insight, more information, and more chuckles than anything<br/>
  else Verant releases.  I especially enjoyed reading his story<br/>
  about the GM event he ran a long time ago.  I wish there were <br/>
  more of him running around at Verant.  The game would<br/>
  probably be a lot more interesting.<br/>
