<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107962791">Just a brief word on statistics.  If you want to get a reasonably good<br/>
approximation of what % something drops, you need a number of tests one<br/>
order of magnitude higher than the range.  So if its 5% you need at least<br/>
200 tests for statistical accuracy.  This isn&#39;t necessarily true for all<br/>
randoms, but for psuedo-random numbers such as computers produce, it is<br/>
generally the applicable rule.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  No, thats not it.  The monster table that Verant uses says<br/>
  that a DW goblin will drop a helm X % of the time.  Because you<br/>
  happened to get a helm 1 out of 5, doesnt mean the next time a<br/>
  helm did drop it wouldn&#39;t have come maybe on the 20th one?  I got<br/>
  my helm on the first DW goblin I killed.  It took me well over<br/>
  20 griffennes to get a charm the first time.  The second time I got it<br/>
  on the third try.  It&#39;s the way statistics work.<br/>
