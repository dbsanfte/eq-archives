Kaesora is virtually deserted on Inny. Like I posted, been there 2 times<br/>
now.  First time, cleared into the Library and presto there was the coin<br/>
guy.  Second time, cleared library, no coin, cleared the other stuff in the<br/>
area, library re-spawned and we got the coin guy.  Less than 2 hours.  Might<br/>
have been the 3rd time to clear the Library but seems to be a fast 30 min<br/>
timer in that zone.<br/>

&gt; The guy in Kaesora<br/>
&gt; was very helpful in telling me how difficult it would be to get the<br/>
&gt; coins and (from what he said) that specific coin was pretty rare </span></blockquote></div>
