<div id="ygrps-yiv-697440358">Your info is quite correct.  I got lucky and got the predator to drop the<br/>
shard a few weeks ago.  I used it for 2 nights and now its collecting dust<br/>
in the bank.  Its not only resisted a lot, forget about using it in Sol A,<br/>
it&#39;s resisted damn near every time.  I am rather surprised about the stamina<br/>
problems that the initial poster of this thread mentioned.  The scimi/dirk<br/>
combo is the same setup I use, and I have yet to see my stamina drop more<br/>
than a bubble.  In fact, I often drop my dirk in my ranged slot and dual<br/>
wield 2 OS&#39;s with very similar results stamina wise.  Maybe its the group<br/>
makeup I have, I imagine if you run in a caster heavy group, you would have<br/>
that problem when mana runs low.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just to correct a post someone made yesterday or the day before:<br/>
The Obsidian Scimitar has no proc but is + 6 AGI or DEX (I forget which)<br/>
The Obsidian Shard has the proc - which is resisted WAY too much in my<br/>
opinion, so if you get one, don&#39;t expect it to become the uber-poker you<br/>
thought it could be hehe.  I personally was very disappointed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been having stamina problems duel wielding an obsidian<br/>
&gt; &gt; scimitar and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dragoon dirk in long battles.  I&#39;m currently trying to figure<br/>
&gt; &gt; out what to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; replace the scimitar with, but I&#39;m not all that sure of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade value of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.  I&#39;ve got an offer on the table of a Silvery War Axe for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Obsidian<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scimitar.  Is this a good trade?<br/>
