<div id="ygrps-yiv-830928864">I think the problem is that most of us have already re-evaluated our<br/>
playlists and determined that in 95% off all balanced groups, the most<br/>
effective thing you can do is be a mana/hp battery. The Cantana/Nivs/Mana<br/>
song combo is so powerful, it&#39;s almost always the &quot;best&quot; thing you can do.<br/>
Unfortunetly we are all too used to being effective in a variety of ways,<br/>
not just one way. Even if you melee while singing the &quot;battery&quot; songs, you<br/>
aren&#39;t scratching the mobs. Test it, fight a certain number of fights<br/>
meleeing and not meleeing. You&#39;ll percieve absolutely no difference in<br/>
outcomes. So You might as well just turn on your gamepad macro and go watch<br/>
a movie.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, we still shine in broken, unbalanced groups, but those very same<br/>
groups can&#39;t really &quot;get anything done&quot; in kunark. At least not when you<br/>
compare them to groups that are balanced.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah. It&#39;s their world. They make the rules. This doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
people don&#39;t have the right to tell them that the rules they have made for<br/>
the bard class squeeze the fun out of it at higher levels.<br/>

&gt; Nice come back.  That is exactly how I play (yea right)  What the<br/>
&gt; hell does this bug fix have to do with the songs I play?  It actually<br/>
&gt; forces me to rethink what songs I sing!  For instance, do I play<br/>
&gt; Celerity to get closer to max haste or do I play McVaxius?  In case<br/>
&gt; you missed something, this fix actually makes haste spell upgrades<br/>
&gt; worth something!  (Does this sound like a movie watching mana bard?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that you got it backwards.  Many of you think that this just<br/>
&gt; adds to the &quot;nerfing us to total mana batteries&quot;  BS!  This makes me<br/>
&gt; re-evaluate my line up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S.  Thanks for ASSuming you know my playing style.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Goodness, people bitch way too much about VI.  What part of,<br/>
&gt; &quot;You&#39;re<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in our world now&quot; did you people not understand?  Was that not<br/>
&gt; a clue<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when you started playing this game?  Max haste was a known bug<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EVERYONE was exploiting.  They fixed it, get over it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more.<br/>
