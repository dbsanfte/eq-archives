<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307202022">I found this posted by someone on a local board. I didn&#39;t do the tests<br/>
myself, and some assumptions have been made in the statistics, but the<br/>
person who posted this has been very reputable so far. If you have any<br/>
doubts about the value of a bard in healing, read on...<br/>

===========<br/>
This is interesting.  I must get try to get a magician to conjure some<br/>
bandages for me.  I take it they weren&#39;t real enthusiastic since I hear that<br/>
it is more trouble than it is worth for them.<br/>
<br/>
You 1hp per 4 skill seems quite accurate since I have 45 skill now and I<br/>
seem to get 10-12 per bandage now.  Hard to tell exact numbers since I&#39;m<br/>
usually poisoned and have my own healing going at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the anecdotal 100 hps per bandage seems to be out of line<br/>
then.  Still, at level 15 my max bind wound would be 80 giving me 20 hits<br/>
per bandage and my hits would be around 480 (for my warrior).  To heal<br/>
normally from 0 to full would take 240 ticks (or around 20 minutes, a tick<br/>
is about 5 seconds by my reckoning).<br/>
Bandages seem to take two full ticks to apply, so working it out with<br/>
bandaging I get 22 ticks for the first half ((11 bandages * 20 hits)+20<br/>
heal) plus 120 ticks for the second half, for a total of 142 ticks (or<br/>
almost 12 minutes).  Not bad, a saving of eight minutes valuable play time<br/>
for the cost of 11 bandages (7 gold at the shop rates).<br/>
<br/>
I did some checking on the healing rate with the bard healing song and I<br/>
discovered that this is +6 hits per tick for a 12th Bard when using his<br/>
lute.  So here&#39;s a table of some figures (feel free to question the accuracy<br/>
since I&#39;m just slapping this out, I&#39;m especially interested if anyone thinks<br/>
that the number of seconds for a heal tick and the number of seconds for a<br/>
bind wound are wrong)<br/>
<br/>
Assume a bind wound skill of 80 and 480 hit points, the time given is to go<br/>
from 0 to 480 hits, bandage costs assume a store price of 6.6 silver, and<br/>
the figures are rough<br/>
<br/>
Person standing			480 ticks	40 minutes	Just for<br/>
reference, but same as diseased person sitting<br/>
Person sitting			240 ticks	20 minutes<br/>
Troll sitting			120 ticks	10 minutes	Troll<br/>
warriors rule!  Accept no substitute :&gt;<br/>
Person being bandaged		142 ticks	12 minutes	Only 2<br/>
minutes to get to half, but costs 7 gold<br/>
Troll being bandaged		78 ticks		6.5 minutes	1.5<br/>
minutes to get to half, costs 6 gold<br/>
Person sitting w. healing song	60 ticks		5 minutes<br/>
Troll sitting w. healing song	48 ticks		4 minutes<br/>
Person w. bandages & song	44 ticks		3.7 minutes<br/>
Bandages save little time, probably not worth the cost<br/>
Troll w. bandages & song	36 ticks		3 minutes<br/>
Ditto, cost 3 gold to save 1 minute<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This makes it clear that a bard is a very valuable commodity, even if they<br/>
just did the healing.  Bandages are worthwhile to bring yourself up to half<br/>
in the absence of other healing, and they have the advantage that you can<br/>
step out of combat for a minute and heal over a hundred hits.  It is also<br/>
useful to bring yourself above one bubble so you can run properly and get<br/>
yourself out of a dangerous area.  You need to be able to throw around some<br/>
gold though.  They can save your ass, and your friends asses so I think it<br/>
is a worthwhile skill to have, but no one is going to complain that it is<br/>
too powerful.</div>
