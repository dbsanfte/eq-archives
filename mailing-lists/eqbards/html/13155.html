&gt; &gt; The point wasn&#39;t whether or not I could tank an ice giant.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Obviously I could since I survived.  The point was whether<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;d be more effective to have a real tank tank it (at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cost of losing his damage on the primary target).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ll rephrase.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eek.  I just reread that.  Just to clarify, I meant no<br/>
disrespect with that statement.  I do appreciate your advice<br/>
on torgors and will inform the shaman/enchanter next time.  <br/>
It just didn&#39;t have anything to do with my question - how<br/>
valid a tactic is it to devote one tank to the extra giant(s).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   That was my point.  You can then concentrate all tanks on one giant,<br/>
&gt;   and allbeit the bard will be attacked, he will not require the healing<br/>
&gt;   attention of the cleric to the extent you describe.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The question still remains though - does the decreased time to<br/>
kill a giant with all tanks attacking offset the extra healing<br/>
required to have the bard tank the extras, torgored or not.  <br/>
Torgors obviously can change the equation, but doesn&#39;t answer<br/>
the question.<br/>
