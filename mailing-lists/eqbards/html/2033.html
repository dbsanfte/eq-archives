<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170176451">Perhaps this is only on my shard (Veeshan) - or perhaps this zone seems so<br/>
quite, not a lot of people realize what we have in lesser faydark. *I*<br/>
would probably never have known had someone not taken me here in a group<br/>
about lvl 8 or so. I am now lvl 17 1/2 and am STILL making exp here - LOTS<br/>
of loot, and more importantly - getting some of the skills that have been<br/>
lagging behind topped off so I am in a good position to continue. I&#39;ve also<br/>
used this spot to help lesser level folks level pretty quickly - keeping an<br/>
eye on them and letting them pick off the easier ones - throwing in with<br/>
just enough help on fights with bellow, and my taking on the stronger ones.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t seem a heck of a lot of folks know about the 2 bandit camps in<br/>
lesser faye - or how incredible they can be for skillbuilding and cash<br/>
generation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that the nybright bandits supposedly spawn between lvls 10-13,<br/>
errrrm - the other day, while still lvl 16 - one conned white to me - and<br/>
all the sisters seem to con easier than they really are - and even NOW, at<br/>
17 - I still can raise skills and get SOME experience off of a lot of greens.<br/>
<br/>
The other camp only has 3 NPCs - and is located over towards the pixie<br/>
tower. Same thing there.<br/>
<br/>
If you are prepared - either yourself or with an appropriately sized group<br/>
- and hunt either of these camps smart - and have a bit of patience,<br/>
everyone benefits - heh, except the bandits of course.<br/>
<br/>
Nybright Camp<br/>
<br/>
While both camps spawn at a decent rate - nybright has 4 sisters and a deep<br/>
ravine in front. The very best way I&#39;ve found to hunt nybright is to pull<br/>
them one at a time down into that ravine. These sisters are highly<br/>
aggressive once you&#39;ve killed a few dozen of them, be sure not to stand too<br/>
close to the tents - or the tree to the right of the camp - one spawns<br/>
there. They also have VERY wicked backstabs - don&#39;t let one get behind you.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to practice your throwing for free - nearly every kill has at<br/>
LEAST one rusty dagger, just keep it and toss it at the next one.<br/>
<br/>
As a bard, my normal hunting method of nybright is to (lull the others of<br/>
course if more than one - you CAN get the spawn spread out to singles with<br/>
a little work) bellow at the edge of my range with melee activated, just as<br/>
soon as it hits - run backwards - I can usually get in at least 3 bellows<br/>
before they even close in for melee. Once you advance in levels - the<br/>
easier ones will of course run - this technique also keeps you from having<br/>
to chase them so far behind the camp if they do (presuming no one can root).<br/>
<br/>
Nybright also has a woodelf outpost very close to it - makes selling a 3min<br/>
round trip proposition. Only folks I&#39;ve seen that have had a problem with<br/>
the outpost are barbarians, like kelethin - they don&#39;t fit thru the door.<br/>
Just be wary of the leg camp near it, if you follow the ridge - stay on the<br/>
far side, I&#39;ve never had a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Some things to watch for - if you&#39;ve been wacking fairies or faye drakes,<br/>
the fayedrake ruin is very close to the camp - and those things can be<br/>
rather nasty in the numbers they are present. Especially if the monarch or<br/>
emperor shows up. Fairly high level fairies also frequently fly thru - for<br/>
both these reasons, I don&#39;t use any area affect songs here.<br/>
<br/>
These girls have graciously provided me and my husband both with the funds<br/>
for full banded armor - his shaman spells, me a combine longsword and<br/>
bloodstained mantle - etc. In short, even with a lot of people there, I&#39;ve<br/>
been known to make 20 plat an hour. Sometimes it&#39;s slower, sometimes better<br/>
- but at the levels we are talking, I just don&#39;t know any other place with<br/>
that quality of loot, for that level of player. At least not in this corner<br/>
of the world.<br/>
<br/>
These girls often have a necklace (lore item) on them, collect all 4 - go<br/>
find the drunkard in kelethin and hail him as &#39;Tanard Nybright&#39;, he&#39;ll then<br/>
talk to you vs. begging money for booze, and give you an item. I&#39;ve done<br/>
this 4 times, best return of loot for this quest was the first time I did<br/>
it - a damask bracer, other three times was pretty much junk.<br/>
<br/>
Patience is the key - don&#39;t get discouraged with a few bad loots (rusty) in<br/>
a row. For one thing, although I NOW destroy those, I trotted to the<br/>
outpost and sold them for a long time. Their cash isn&#39;t too bad either, and<br/>
they fairly often carry bronze weapons, gems and jewelry - all worth<br/>
between 1 - 4 or 5 plat each.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a nice feeling to be on the way home, and encumbered with cash<br/>
<br/>
Now, the other bandit camp seems similar - except you don&#39;t get NEARLY as<br/>
much junk (rust), If you see one of these carrying a rapier or spear IT IS<br/>
bronze. They too carry gems and jewelry. A lot farther from the outpost, I<br/>
usually just hunt there till I am full, and then call it a trip and go<br/>
home. There is a huge hill overlooking this camp, I use the same technique<br/>
here, just pull them over the hill.  The other camp also has wandering<br/>
cents and an occassional skeleton - so watch your mages backs while they<br/>
are medding.<br/>
<br/>
I am in a happy place now - still hunting these for skills - am at 17 1/2,<br/>
and my dual is nearly maxed out - my dodge and defense are nearly maxed out<br/>
- and I&#39;m planning on working on piercing and throwing there - which I&#39;ve<br/>
NEVER touched at all. <br/>
<br/>
If you are ever on Veeshan, and see Adory there, say howdy.</div>
