song, which means using it somewhere like Cazic Thule is asking for<br/>
every mob your party is fighting and half the mobs the parties around<br/>
you are fighting to all come attack you. :) I dont mind having one mob<br/>
come beat on me instead of the cleric, so the cleric can get off heal<br/>
spells on the real tanks, but attracting a gang isnt something I really<br/>
want to do. <br/>
<br/>
Now Pixie Strike (formerly pixie chase) might work for that. It seems to<br/>
be sort of a targetted lullaby, but the few times I&#39;ve used it I haven&#39;t<br/>
noticed if it cleared the hate list, in fact it didn&#39;t seem to be all<br/>
that useful at all. The few times it worked it kept one mob standing<br/>
around for about 10 seconds. If that&#39;s all it does, I dont see why you&#39;d<br/>
use it instead of charm, which basically does the same thing with the<br/>
added bonus that you can have the mob attack it&#39;s friends for those 10<br/>
seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone found some use for Pixie Strike I may have missed?<br/>
