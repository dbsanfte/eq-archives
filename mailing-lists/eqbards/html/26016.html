songs we get are crap. I&#39;m having trouble staying interested. I thought Bard<br/>
would be the best class to play, because you don&#39;t have to wait four to ten<br/>
levels for any new stuff, but get a song every level...but when the songs do<br/>
things like identify items and imbue a non-magical weapon (which none of us<br/>
have used since the first few levels) as a Magic one, it&#39;s a total waste.<br/>
