Rokenn should add it.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The song grants a damage shield, cold resist on par with<br/>
Elemental Rhythms with a normal drum, and infravision.  <br/>
<br/>
The song is more effective in small groups.  The number of<br/>
times a mob hits your party does not increase with the number<br/>
of group members (it actually goes down since you kill the mob<br/>
quicker), so the benefit of this song is not increased as your<br/>
group gets larger.  Thus in larger groups, it can make more<br/>
sense to use a scaling song (e.g. Anthem or Hymn).  OTOH, in a<br/>
small group or while soloing, this song can easily account for<br/>
10%-20% or more of the damage applied to a mob.<br/>
<br/>
The song is more effective in multi-mob engagements, typically<br/>
against greens which won&#39;t do much damage to you.  It will let<br/>
your party concentrate on a main target(s), while letting the<br/>
extra mobs kill themselves by beating on your party.  <br/>
Obviously if the extra mobs are doing a significant amount of<br/>
damage, you&#39;re better off mesmerizing or Lullabying them.  <br/>
Hence it&#39;s most useful against swarms of greens.  Just make<br/>
sure none of the greens run away.<br/>
<br/>
Because the song damages the mob *when you are hit*, other<br/>
effects that benefit the party can lessen the effectiveness of<br/>
this song.  Slowing down the mob&#39;s attacks, and raising your<br/>
agility/AC so you are hit less frequently will do this.  In<br/>
the extreme case, mesmerizing the extra mobs will completely<br/>
eliminate the damage they&#39;d take from this song :-).  Keep<br/>
this in mind when deciding which songs to use.  e.g. if you<br/>
must play this song (perhaps for the cold resist), and have a<br/>
choice between Chain (to slow the mob&#39;s attacks) and Celerity<br/>
(to speed up your party&#39;s attacks), this would be a factor<br/>
favoring Celerity.<br/>
<br/>
The following is an algebraic calculation I sent to this list<br/>
when someone asked which he should use when soloing - Bellow<br/>
or Psalm of Warmth:<br/>
<br/>
5 pts/hit at L25.  You guys are lucky, it used to be 4 when I<br/>
first got it but got upgraded a couple months ago.<br/>
<br/>
If a mob hits for D points on average, and you have H hp, and<br/>
the damage shield does S damage per hit, then the damage<br/>
shield will do S*(H/D) points damage over the fight.  If the<br/>
mobs average N hits per song round (3-4 sec for most bards),<br/>
and Bellow does B damage on average (including resists),<br/>
Bellow sung once while weaving 3 songs will do (B/3N)*(H/D)<br/>
points damage.  Divide to remove the common factor and you end<br/>
up with:<br/>
<br/>
If B &gt; 3S*N then it makes more sense to use Bellow.<br/>
<br/>
You can figure out B and N with all the nifty new log parsers,<br/>
S you can tell from the messages when you&#39;re fighting.  This<br/>
will work for multiple mob encounters too, just add up all the<br/>
mob hits when determining N.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
e.g. if your Bellow does 12 points on average, the mobs<br/>
average 1 hit per round, and the damage shield does 5 points<br/>
per hit, then:<br/>
<br/>
12 &gt; 3*5*1<br/>
<br/>
Which is false, so in this case it makes more sense to use<br/>
Psalm of Warmth.<br/>
