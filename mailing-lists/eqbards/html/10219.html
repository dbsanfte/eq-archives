 </span></blockquote>Sylly - I used to wonder who the cute well-armored Bard five levels lower than me <br/>
was.  Now you&#39;re four levels above me, even better armored (and still cute, of <br/>
course)!  You may live to regret your offer, too.  I&#39;m quite likely to take you up <br/>
on it!  First, though, I think my guild wants to cart me around for a weekend.  <br/>
They&#39;ve been telling me for a month that as soon as I reached level 33, they&#39;d <br/>
start to haul me around, and now that I&#39;ve got it, I&#39;m calling in my note.  hehe<br/>
<br/>
As for twinking, it bothered me for awhile, but I&#39;d be a hypocrite to whine about <br/>
it now.  Hmmm, let me review my armor:<br/>
<br/>
Spiked Collar, two +2 STR earrings, two +7 DEX +5 CHR rings, bought and paid for.<br/>
<br/>
Bronze Cape, Boots, Gauntlets, Mask - Traded 2 sets of hand-made banded for these <br/>
(also got Bronze Breastplate, Leggings and Helm)<br/>
<br/>
Skull-Shaped Barbute - Had to give up my Steel Helm, but this is a semi-twink from <br/>
a higher level guild member.<br/>
<br/>
Barbed Vambraces, Serpentine Bracer, Silver-Plated Bracer(?), Steel Breastplate, <br/>
Silver-Plated Leggings, Crested Gauntlets - All handed to me by higher level guild <br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
Staff of Writhing - higher level guild member gave it to me.<br/>
<br/>
Tainted Tier&#39;dal Rapier - higher level guild member let me loot his solo kill.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also given my level 11 Warrior:  Bronze BP, Helm, Boots, Bloodstained Mantle, <br/>
Barbed Leggings, Dwarven Axe, 2 +3 STR rings and 100pp (the Mantle and the Leggings <br/>
I got from, yes, a higher level guild member).  I only play my warrior when I feel <br/>
like being mindless, and who wants to sit and heal all night?  I mean, sitting like <br/>
a lump IS the height of mindlessness, I admit, but please...<br/>
<br/>
Not that I couldn&#39;t have afforded to BUY some of this stuff.  I have 2000pp in the <br/>
bank.  Still, twinking has done OK by me.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the lesson?  JOIN A GUILD.<br/>
