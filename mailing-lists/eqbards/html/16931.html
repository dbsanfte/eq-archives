<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529474774">At level 14 tanks haven&#39;t really developed a taunt ability yet and you can definately do very well without balanced groups.  Heck! I can remember being primary healer at level 14.  By the 30&#39;s though running around in circles waiting for a taunt will only get you killed or the healer beat up and isn&#39;t really an option in most dungeon settings.  Those of you who have been in the Sol A King&#39;s room and had a wizard run from one side of it to the other and back 3 or 4 times trying to get away from a Goblin know what I&#39;m talking about...<br/>
  Personally though, I&#39;ve found it pretty tough for a<br/>
  14th lvl bard to root or stun three dervishes at once.<br/>
  If you&#39;re going to tell me the party should do that,<br/>
  please go back and read my initial words: &quot;If I had a<br/>
  dollar for every time I waited...&quot; <br/>
