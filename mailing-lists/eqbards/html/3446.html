<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113207052">Well met everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had the pleasure to play to bard&#39;s on two separate servers, and I am<br/>
finding something very interesting going on that I thought I would ask the<br/>
rest of you about.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started playing on the Prexus server, which is a fairly new<br/>
server, I had no problems finding same or near level players to group with.<br/>
Not only were people happy to have the services of a bard along for the<br/>
journey, but for some who had never grouped with a bard they found out first<br/>
hand the benefits that our profession can provide.<br/>
<br/>
Of late though, I have joined some firends playing on the Mithaniel Marr<br/>
server, and I am finding that when my compatriots are not online that I<br/>
spend most if not all my time soloing. No groups seem to have need of my<br/>
service, and when I do find groups to adventure with they seek me out not<br/>
for the healing, strength or speed that I can provide, but to take blows at<br/>
the hands of monsters.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticied that there are far fewer people of a comparable level, and<br/>
that many of the players belong to guilds of various natures. Perhaps this<br/>
is a consequence of playing on a more established server where players have<br/>
had more time to develop their characters.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a complaint mind you. Soloing has made me into a hardy adventure<br/>
able to cope with circumstance well beyond my meager skills. Has anyone else<br/>
had experiences similar to these?<br/>
<br/>
