 </span></blockquote>Yes, my Bard is a half-elf. I/we may dislike the way the banded helm looks,<br/>
but it sure looks better than the leather one did. I&#39;ve pretty much started<br/>
considering just not wearing one because I like the way my character looks<br/>
without anything on his head.<br/>
<br/>
It would be neat if you could buy/wear the pointy type hats for wizards<br/>
don&#39;t you think? My wizard would be all over that.. hehe</div>
