<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411094780"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; you must be a half elf, I HATE that.  I spent<br/>
&gt; alot of time getting the Blackened Iron Crown,<br/>
&gt; only to find out that it looked the SAME, just<br/>
&gt; a little different color trim.  ARGGGHHHH<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, my Bard is a half-elf. I/we may dislike the way the banded helm looks,<br/>
but it sure looks better than the leather one did. I&#39;ve pretty much started<br/>
considering just not wearing one because I like the way my character looks<br/>
without anything on his head.<br/>
<br/>
It would be neat if you could buy/wear the pointy type hats for wizards<br/>
don&#39;t you think? My wizard would be all over that.. hehe</div>
