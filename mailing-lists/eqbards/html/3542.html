<div id="ygrps-yiv-898009177">In the name of Erollisi I hope there is another way to get these than by<br/>
killing one of the sisters.  I feel dirty at even the thought that there are<br/>
Necromancers hunting sisters for there pelts, I mean belts.  I guess I will<br/>
have to make a pilgrimage to that island and cast my belt into the sea.  I<br/>
have much pennance to do for profitting by the death of such an unfortunate.<br/>
<br/>
	Good thing I&#39;m not on the pvp server or I&#39;d spend all my time dying<br/>
while trying to prevent people from killing the poor little sisters.  come<br/>
to think of it that&#39;s why I&#39;m not on the pvp server.  I&#39;d be spending all my<br/>
time dying trying to protect all the good people getting killed by other<br/>
supposedly good people.  Nothing like watching a paladin slaughtering<br/>
stonecarvers in Butcherblock, asking him what he&#39;s doing, and having him<br/>
respond, &quot;They&#39;re the only thing in BB that gives me xp, and I can kill them<br/>
while waiting for the boat.&quot;  If that isn&#39;t bad enough, he was in<br/>
/roleplaying mode!  Some people will never get it.<br/>
