&gt; &gt;The minos in Steamfont are weaker than the minos in the Gorge of King Xorrb<br/>
&gt; &gt;(all except for one Mino Hero who is a real meanie!)<br/>

&gt;Actually, you&#39;re right about the mino slavers, but the minotaur guards in<br/>
&gt;Meldrath&#39;s room are blue to a lvl 50 and hit for 75+. They are very mean. =)<br/>
&gt;They make the Minotaur Hero look like pansy. Well, since last I checked<br/>
&gt;anyways (bout 3 weeks ago).<br/>

Druid, and the Minotaur Guards in Meldraths room conned green, and never <br/>
even attacked him, while Meldrath was a &quot;risky&quot; blue (and kicked his butt <br/>
most mightily, I might add.).  I kept telling him &quot;You need a Bard.  A Bard <br/>
could help with that.  You know... if you had a Bard.....&quot;  He hates me now ;)<br/>
