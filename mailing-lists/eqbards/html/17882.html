<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Much as I&#39;ve enjoyed using it, I can attest to it&#39;s power, and perhaps<br/>
&gt; overpower.  In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd control.  Whenever<br/>
&gt; two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second, command it to /pet<br/>
&gt; guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a ways away, and<br/>
&gt; reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>
&gt; enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>
&gt; clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I finally feel like my old level 30 self again.  This weekend I led an<br/>
Efreeti run.  On the third pull someone wandered off a little too far and<br/>
agroed 2 Lava Guardians and 3 Imps right after we had finished off an imp.<br/>
Our enchanter went OOM after the first of the 3 remaining Imps fell leaving<br/>
me to crowd control alone.  Using Charm on one of the imps, I was able to<br/>
keep both imps busy while we were able to finish off the lava elementals and<br/>
then the imps with no further casualties :).  From that point forward, the<br/>
enchanter and I had it worked out so that I would charm the extra incoming<br/>
in each pull and keep them busy while he mezzed singles.  I would then tell<br/>
him when the charm broke so he could start mezzing my pet.  This had the<br/>
nice effect of keeping the imp pounding on me instead of the enchanter until<br/>
he could get the mez to stick as well as giving us an extra hand in battle.<br/>
We repeated the process every time mez broke as well with great success.<br/>
The enchanter barely took damage the rest of the break in and used a lot<br/>
less mana.<br/>
<br/>
I was EXTREMELY tempted to attempt pulling for this raid...  I really wanted<br/>
to try out a combination of Lament and charm to pull on these to see if I<br/>
could really control the pulling better then the monk.  In the end I went<br/>
with traditional break in techniques but I&#39;m not so sure the traditional<br/>
break in is the best way to go anymore.  Have any of you tried Lament on the<br/>
Imp or Lava guardians or been the puller for the Efreeti raid?  If Lament<br/>
would work, I really think that a single well balanced party of 6 might be<br/>
able to handle the break in alone.... :)  If none of you have tried it, I<br/>
think I might go for it next weekend...<br/>
<br/>
BTW, 2 Efreeti in the first 3 spawns and then we were shut out with only<br/>
place holders for the next 10 hours...<br/>
