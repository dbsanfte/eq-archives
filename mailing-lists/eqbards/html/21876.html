<div id="ygrps-yiv-251286607">Just one . . . me, almost 31.  Besides that there is a level 28, 12 and a 7.<br/>
I did a /who all bard 30 40, /who all bard 41 50, /who all bard 51 60, the<br/>
other day when there were 2400 people on the server and only came up with a<br/>
total of about 30 people across all 3 searches. =&#92;  More armor for me I guess!<br/>

&gt;The more i play, the less bards i realize there are. When i do a /who all<br/>
&gt;bard in my guild, i count 2 bards at the most, me and a lev 52 (unless<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s a hidden one somewhere).  How sad is that? do a /who all warrior or<br/>
&gt;any other class in the guild and you&#39;ll see on average 7.  Mind you in a<br/>
&gt;weird way this is to my advantage as whenever i&#39;m planes capable, i wont<br/>
&gt;have to lotto for imbrued since she&#39;s got a full set, a breath of harmony<br/>
&gt;and a partisan.  But still, i still wish there were more bards around but i<br/>
&gt;think the numbers will keep dropping as i read this mailing list 8(<br/>
