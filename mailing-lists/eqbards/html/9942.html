&gt; I&#39;ve heard that bard tracking is probably the best in the game.  Rangers<br/>
&gt; tracking is way too far, and druid tracking isn&#39;t far enough.<br/>

Sometimes I&#39;m pulling random stuff and just want what&#39;s<br/>
closest, sometimes I&#39;m looking for a rare mob and don&#39;t mind<br/>
wandering the entire zone looking for it.  Our tracking, being<br/>
in the middle, is a good compromise, but I wouldn&#39;t call it<br/>
the &quot;best.&quot;  There are many situations where a ranger is<br/>
better, and there are many situations where a druid is<br/>
better.<br/>
