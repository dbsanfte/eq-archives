 </span></blockquote>Just so you folks know, warping like this is a function of<br/>
ping*PL/bandwidth.  We have to deal with this stuff (minimize<br/>
it) all the time for the stuff my company does.  Minimizing it<br/>
requires a lot of bandwidth (which is why most FPP shooters<br/>
limit the number of players allowed in a game).  The only way<br/>
to eliminate warping is to not make the game real-time.<br/>
<br/>
However, IMHO, the implementation in EQ is poorly done.<br/>
