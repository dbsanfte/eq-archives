&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When playing my new bard, I took a common suggestion I heard of making<br/>
&gt;hotkeys for the two melee slots and several (four) invetory slots. I have<br/>
&gt;bags/boxes in my other four slots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This makes it very easy to switch instruments/weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wondering, is there any trick to keeping those inventory slots open<br/>
&gt;(i.e. free of random loot) without manually having to put every item into<br/>
&gt;a bag? I bought a mandolin and horn to fill 2 more slots, but there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;still 1 empty slot (which needs to stay empty, so when I swap out 1<br/>
&gt;instrument, there&#39;s room for a shield + weapon). Anytime I look anything<br/>
&gt;it gets automatically dropped into that slot, which is very annoying when<br/>
&gt;trying to switch weapons later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hopefully there&#39;s some good tips out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks, =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is one trick, if one of your weapons can be equipped in the <br/>
ranged weapon slot (dragoon dirks, mino axes maybe others, I<br/>
don&#39;t know precisely which) replace one of the general slots with<br/>
the ranged weapon slot.  <br/>
<br/>
Now you have<br/>
<br/>
General  Ranged<br/>
Melee 1  Melee 2<br/>
General  General<br/>
<br/>
if the three generals have instruments in them, <br/>
Grab Main weapon, drop in ranged (or swap<br/>
with instrument) swap with second weapon <br/>
(or pick up instrument and swap) drop back in<br/>
empty general spot or ranged slot <br/>
<br/>
Since the 3 general slots are always full, and<br/>
nothing auto drops to the ranged, you always<br/>
have it free.<br/>
<br/>
Just be sure to not have a ranged attack key<br/>
where you might hit it by mistake :)</div>
