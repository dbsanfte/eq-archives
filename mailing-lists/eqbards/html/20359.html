<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888173181">Clerics get 5 per level to offense and defense (I&#39;m pretty sure, my cleric<br/>
never melees).  However they get 4 per level to their weapon skills, where<br/>
as we get 5.  We also get dual weild.<br/>
<br/>
After level 20 where you start raising your max damage this seems to make a<br/>
biggere difference.  My 24 cleric has NEVER hit for more than 13 with his<br/>
Bullsmasher (dam 6).  Keep in mind he has a str of 108 vs Elfson&#39;s 97.  I<br/>
tried meleeing same very green BB gnolls, and still never went over 13.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure how the extra damage is calculated, but clearly the wis casters are<br/>
behidn bards in this regard too.</div>
