the loot she wants. It inspired me to write this song.<br/>

A Material Elf <br/>
(Sung to Madonna&#39;s &quot;Material Girl&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
Some groups want me, some groups beg me <br/>
I think they&#39;re O.K. <br/>
If they don&#39;t put me on their loot list <br/>
I just walk away. <br/>
<br/>
They can beg and they can plead <br/>
But they&#39;re just there to fight, that&#39;s right <br/>
`Cause the groups with the cold hard loot <br/>
Always turns out right, `cause we are <br/>
<br/>
Chorus: <br/>
Living in a Verant made world <br/>
And I am a material elf <br/>
You know that we are living in a Verant made world <br/>
And I am a material elf. <br/>
<br/>
Some groups do raids, some groups get paid <br/>
That&#39;s all right with me <br/>
If they can&#39;t give me proper treasure <br/>
Have to let them be <br/>
<br/>
Some groups try and some groups die <br/>
They don&#39;t see the light <br/>
Only groups who give me rare drops <br/>
Make me squeal in delight, `cause they are <br/>
<br/>
(chorus) <br/>
<br/>
Living in a Verant made world [Verant made] <br/>
Living in a Verant made world <br/>
(repeat) <br/>
<br/>
Groups may come and groups may go <br/>
And that&#39;s all right with me. <br/>
Equipment is what it&#39;s all about: <br/>
Survivability, `cause everybody&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
(chorus)</div>
