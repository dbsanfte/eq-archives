<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532932798"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: Jim Mattson &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jmattson@...">jmattson@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recently, I was grouped with a necro who asked me to sing Jaxan&#39;s<br/>
&gt; while she<br/>
&gt; was meditating.  She claimed to notice a *big* difference.  Now, I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; the discussions of how Jaxan&#39;s changes the meditation tick interval from<br/>
&gt; 8 seconds to 6 seconds, thereby increasing mana regeneration as a<br/>
&gt; side effect.<br/>
&gt; However, the druid I usually group with has said that she doesn&#39;t notice<br/>
&gt; any difference.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All necros I&#39;ve ever grouped with want me to play hymn of restoration and<br/>
they claim it greatly helps their mana regen.  All other mana users see no<br/>
increase in mana regen no matter what song I play.  Maybe this is a bug that<br/>
just affects Necros?<br/>
