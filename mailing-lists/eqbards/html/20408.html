<div id="ygrps-yiv-979904849">I do not know about other servers, but on EMarr this is apparently<br/>
considered okay.  Another friend of mine died while practicing (we later<br/>
figured out that someone lured the swashbuckler into song range), and<br/>
when she petitioned to find out how she died, the answer was that &quot;that<br/>
was the risk she took while going afk&quot; but that there had been nothing<br/>
wrong with what she did otherwise.  They implied that it was inadvisable,<br/>
but not bannable.  Then again, guides and GMs are not always of like<br/>
minds, as far as I can tell.  Who knows what an actualy GM might have<br/>
said.<br/>
