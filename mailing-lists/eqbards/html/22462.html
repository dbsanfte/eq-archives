<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299616557">Thanks for all the tips, Evulia! They are truely good advice.<br/>
 <br/>
Unfortunately, this camp is proceeding like a bad Plane raid. My paint had<br/>
really bad AC apparently (3 gallons for one small bedroom!), so it was not<br/>
completed before the whole zone got trained on us (3 guys and a very large<br/>
moving truck). We managed to trap a good bit of the train in the Basement<br/>
and Garage, but they will have to be cleared at some point too. I did learn<br/>
not to have a druid or a mage, even a tall one, help you paint. They got<br/>
paint all over my ceilings! My cleric was invaluable in hanging the<br/>
curtains/blinds though, he had all the reagents and did a wonderful job. I<br/>
still need to use Binding on some of the curtains (too long). The monk has<br/>
been great as well, splitting up the box spawn enough to get the small, more<br/>
delicate spawns pulled before the repop. As usual, I&#39;m in charge of what<br/>
goes where as everyone knows bards are the ones to talk to about fashion and<br/>
organization. As a result, I can barely start on one box before the group<br/>
members present start yelling for help in another part of the zone. The<br/>
cleric has Root, he just can&#39;t seem to decide where to use it.<br/>
<br/>
Our biggest problems are the spawns with the really good loot just haven&#39;t<br/>
pop&#39;ed: the New Mattress, the Undented New Range, and the Backordered New<br/>
Furniture. Apparently, they are rare. Some of the box spawns can&#39;t be<br/>
cleared til these big guys finally pop! Hymn is becoming invaluable, as<br/>
sleeping on the floor is really hard on the hit points.<br/>
<br/>
The cleric is working hard now on getting us back online at home; maybe we<br/>
will get to play again in another week!<br/>
