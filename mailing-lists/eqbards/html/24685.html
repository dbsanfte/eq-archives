<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956895053"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Last night was yucky. We ported up to Air with the <br/>
&gt; intentions of going to the 4th Isle to finish the necro <br/>
&gt; epic only to have IC port up on top of us.<br/>
&gt; They decided to roll to see who stayed and who left and <br/>
&gt; we lost the roll!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, DC was doing Hate again last night, and I heard IC (Inner <br/>
Circle) was in Air. It sounds as though things were handled pretty <br/>
well -- rolled for the right to stay. I still remember the day I <br/>
heard IC and HL (Havenlight) were both in Fear. To say there is no <br/>
love between those two would be an understatement (from what I know.)<br/>
<br/>
On another note, IC does have one REALLY nice person... if you get a <br/>
chance to meet Yeoman, you will be please. Even though he has an IC <br/>
tag, I would help him or hunt with him anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
