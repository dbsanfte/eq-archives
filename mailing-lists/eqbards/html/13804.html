<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092463646">Well its pretty near 25% with a charisma of 156.  Our enchanter tried his<br/>
mez and got a resist rate of 8% vs the same mobs with a 158 charisma.  And<br/>
his lasted a heck of a lot longer than 6 seconds.  I&#39;ll try to remember to<br/>
/bug that the resist message is not in red since supposedly all resist<br/>
messages are in red.<br/>

Also, sorry if I have seemed to come down really hard on Verant&#39;s Dev staff.<br/>
We have had some serious problems in the past with the same issues and had<br/>
to let people go.  The funny thing is the problems they had were minor<br/>
compared to the stuff the testers at Verant let thru.  I try to convince<br/>
people here how important professionalism and accepting responsibility are<br/>
and its a tough battle sometimes.<br/>

&gt; I played a bit at lunch.  Now that we have a the<br/>
&gt; secondary resist message on Lullaby, it is<br/>
&gt; disturbingly easy to see just how incredibly<br/>
&gt; poorly lullaby works.  I was fighting groups of<br/>
&gt; faeries in lfay (that are barely blue to me) and<br/>
&gt; getting less than 50% success rate at lullabying<br/>
&gt; them.  This is with singing the song continuously<br/>
&gt; like GZ said we should.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my hope - that once it becomes obvious how poorly the<br/>
song works (whereas before people could just say it was our<br/>
imagination), enough people will complain that they&#39;ll unnerf<br/>
it.  Send /feedback saying that the new resist message should<br/>
be red, not blue.  That will make it even more obvious.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I&#39;m going to try getting my charisma up around 200<br/>
(still need a couple more items) and see what the resist rate<br/>
on level 1 mobs is like.<br/>
