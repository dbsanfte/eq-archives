<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028725457">Don&#39;t get mad, just playing Devil&#39;s Advocate.  I think a lot of people I&#39;ve<br/>
grouped with ascribe to the idea &quot;If it ain&#39;t best for you, you shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
in on it&quot;.  Your argument just gives their fire more fuel and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
need it.  We&#39;re already seeing bard&#39;s excluded on loot more and more, at<br/>
this point I think we need reasons why that isn&#39;t fair, not justifications<br/>
for why it might be reasonable to exclude us.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of people far less reasonable than you and I who will take<br/>
your arguments exactly the way I responded, and use your own words to back<br/>
their side up.<br/>

&gt; By that same reasoning bards should never get any equipment except magical<br/>

Grrr.  You seem to have a penchant of taking what I say and<br/>
twisting it to the extremes.  I said these are reasons that<br/>
bards should have lower priority on these items.  How a guild<br/>
wants to factor these priorities into loot distribution is<br/>
entirely up to them.<br/>
<br/>
I stated that my personal feeling is that it&#39;s sufficient<br/>
reason to exclude bards from the RBB and CoF, but not the FBSS<br/>
and swirlspine.  You erroneously concluded that &quot;lower<br/>
priority&quot; = &quot;exclusion from loot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When you brought up the possibility that the haste thing might<br/>
be &quot;fixed,&quot; I explained why it did not change the balance in<br/>
the way you thought they would.<br/>
