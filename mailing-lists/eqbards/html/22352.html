<b>Subject:</b> Test Problem fixed <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962591448">Although they haven&#39;t said much about this, apparently it was caused by some<br/>
other code they introduced and was unintended.  See below.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything that has been put in to in any way limit the duration of a<br/>
continuously sung song?  If &#39;aye&#39;, then why and when? If &#39;nay&#39;, then it&#39;s a<br/>
bug and we can help from there. <br/>
A player had the answer:<br/>
<br/>
The &#39;your song stops abruptly&#39; message never happens on test now, songs are<br/>
back to normal. It is fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Absor concurred:<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true.<br/>

Makes sense.  First thing doctors on TV do is check for a pulse.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
