<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-111586842">Finally left my regular group and learned to use siren<br/>
song.  Here are some notes I haven&#39;t seen posted or in<br/>
any guide:<br/>
<br/>
Tarskuk, the named cyclops is 33rd lvl and runs faster<br/>
than SOW.<br/>
<br/>
The area to the right of the Lake Rathetear zone is a<br/>
valley with a large hill in the middle (bandit camp on<br/>
the hill top).  There is a gypsy camp to the North and<br/>
an undead tower to the South.  The East side of this<br/>
&quot;racetrack&quot; seldom has any action and this is prolly<br/>
the best area for easy charm kiting.  Optionally you<br/>
can pull two Clops North of the gypsy camp to the open<br/>
area near the ruined druid ring for your kiting. <br/>
<br/>
The cyclops are often well camped and many people who<br/>
don&#39;t understand the bard class take exception to you<br/>
and two angry cyclops barreling thru their peaceful<br/>
camp.  Any trains that occur during this time will<br/>
likely be blamed on you.<br/>
<br/>
I like to get on early in the morning when there are<br/>
few people in the zone.  There are seldom any &#39;clops<br/>
spawned at this time.  Kill the placeholders,<br/>
lizardmen, bears and giant skeletons until a few<br/>
cyclops pop.  <br/>
<br/>
Always kill placeholders until at least three cyclops<br/>
spawn.  It is a sad thing when you&#39;ve got a cyclops in<br/>
tow and the second is taken by a group that has just<br/>
arrived.  If this happens, relax.  Not even Tarskuk<br/>
can catch you with that drum equiped.  Just run around<br/>
the track until you see your next victim.  If nothing<br/>
else, you can have your pet-in-tow kill placeholders<br/>
for you until more cyclops spawn.  You will be<br/>
surprised at how quickly cyclops can kill a bear or<br/>
lizardman so be quick to retarget.<br/>
<br/>
Charm kiting with a group:<br/>
<br/>
Generally a bad idea.  Cyclops hit very hard and<br/>
mistakes are often deadly.  But if you do, post your<br/>
healers by the zone entrance and run by if you get<br/>
into trouble.  If you&#39;re really in trouble, the zone<br/>
is right there.  Melee type can hang out near the<br/>
gypsy camp and you can train your weakened ex-pet to<br/>
them for great xp.  Have the melee types kill<br/>
placeholders while you charm for a never-ending supply<br/>
of prey.  At this point, the cyclops will ignore the<br/>
warriors in your group.  Just keep it chained and at a<br/>
distance and the fighters can walk behind it while the<br/>
cyclops remains focused on you.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  Enchanters have much better charming ability<br/>
than we do.  the difference is that we run like the<br/>
gingerbread man so mistakes and unexpected problems<br/>
are much easier to avoid.  If you are lucky enough to<br/>
group with an enchanter, let him/her charm while you<br/>
sing Selo&#39;s.  Chain/Bellow/FCC the other cyclops and<br/>
keep your finger near the Selos hotkey in case the<br/>
unexpected happens.<br/>
<br/>
Suggested songs to memm:<br/>
<br/>
Anthem/Chant of Battle<br/>
Chains<br/>
Hymm<br/>
Selo&#39;s<br/>
Bellow<br/>
FCC<br/>
Screach<br/>
Siren song<br/>
<br/>
