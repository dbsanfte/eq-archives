&gt;Im new to the list , so I dont know if this has been discussed. I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;recently got to level 30 and in reading the Song List v2.0 on<br/>
&gt;the Level 30 song it said it was a DoT which lower magic Resistance as well. <br/>
&gt;But it seems to be a Direct Target song  (it has a red<br/>
&gt;icon like Bellow and Chain) and didnt do any noticeable damage. Is this a MR <br/>
&gt;lowering song only? Anyone tested this song yet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>DoT doesnt necessarily mean that its an AOE song. The song does like 40 pts<br/>
of dmg or soemthing similiar over 4 pulses and it lowers your magic<br/>
resistance. You can target yourself too see exactly what it does.</div>
