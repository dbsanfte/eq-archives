 </span></blockquote>Well, I do that too.  I&#39;ve given away two shiny brass shields,<br/>
screaming mace, combine rapier, combine longsword, two dwarven<br/>
tunics, dwarven axe, bracer of battle, shiny brass halberd,<br/>
lockjaw vest, lots of snakeskin stuff, and countless other<br/>
lesser items and plat, and I&#39;m still rolling in money.  I<br/>
would&#39;ve given away the bloodstained gloves I got last night<br/>
too except we were trying some funky new looting system and<br/>
they were the only things I got for the night.  It&#39;s getting<br/>
worse too - the people I&#39;ve given this stuff to are starting<br/>
to give ME stuff.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s this hidden luck stat that I keep hearing about.<br/>
Given the nature of the bard, if I were programming the game,<br/>
I would&#39;ve given bards a bonus to luck.  :-)<br/>
