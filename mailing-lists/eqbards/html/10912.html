Your letter is taken well to heart and I appreciate everyones responses to<br/>
my morning rant.  I too enjoy helping younger players, and in fact I&#39;m<br/>
probably going to help a 19th bard work on his first Lambent Bracer tonight<br/>
(the piece I judged the easiest to get at his level).  I cook and do pottery<br/>
as well and find it fun.  Like Sylly I love to hand out pies or cookies and<br/>
milk to my parties when we do well.  They always enjoy it immensely.  I have<br/>
players from all over Fennin Ro, some I haven&#39;t grouped with for days,<br/>
giving me /tells saying they&#39;ve got a stack of Froglok or fruit or something<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m cooling down.  The game is a lot of fun and I&#39;ve made some good<br/>
friends.  I&#39;ll just try and stear clear of the Lambent-colored guy running<br/>
from beetles in the newbie zones...<br/>

&gt; Uhh, this means you look at this as a competition, EQ is not a<br/>
&gt; competition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My bard is lvl 23 - I don&#39;t particularly care if I EVER get her<br/>
&gt; any higher,<br/>
&gt; it will come when it comes. Just broke down the other night and put on<br/>
&gt; bronze greaves - something I swore I&#39;d never do, still have the banded tho<br/>
&gt; - may switch back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My focus is LIVING in the world - not monster slaying. UO is much better<br/>
&gt; for that - play that too, the ONLY reason I am in EQ at all - my husband<br/>
&gt; started playing, and it is nice not to get stabbed in the back by<br/>
&gt; a teammate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I fish, cook, do pottery, brew, tailor, smith, jewelcraft a LOT of things<br/>
&gt; other than slay monsters (which frankly, I wish I could skip<br/>
&gt; completely). I<br/>
&gt; am just as happy running around harvesting silk and snake eggs -<br/>
&gt; as someone<br/>
&gt; that goes and monster bashes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I spend many an evening at the CB zone with my little horn, just derailing<br/>
&gt; trains - that is FUN for me, saving lower level folks - keeping<br/>
&gt; some of the<br/>
&gt; trainwrecks I remember from when I was that level from happening is<br/>
&gt; ENJOYABLE for me. I also usually chat quite a bit with the lower<br/>
&gt; levels and<br/>
&gt; occassionally am even able to pass on some small advice, guess I&#39;m just a<br/>
&gt; teacher at heart. In particular, I get a ton of folks (and not necessarily<br/>
&gt; real newbies either - 2nd, 3rd characters of higher players) say - gee - I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know bards could do that, kewl! Lots of lower level bards<br/>
&gt; have never<br/>
&gt; heard of twisting, tons of folks don&#39;t know what the heck lullaby is. Bet<br/>
&gt; they remember later tho - when they are grouped with a bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What does this mean - well, I&#39;ve played for a LONG time, tons and tons of<br/>
&gt; people I&#39;ve interacted with over my career are 50 - I often get approached<br/>
&gt; by their 2nd or 3rd characters - Hey...this is so and so, remember me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IMHO, basing EQ on levels was predestined to cause this problem. That is<br/>
&gt; one of the prime things that cause EQ to not be a &#39;virtual world&#39;. In a<br/>
&gt; virtual world (vs. a game) - there is no end, you can&#39;t &#39;win&#39;. Someday one<br/>
&gt; of these games will wise up and realize that putting the focus on<br/>
&gt; living in<br/>
&gt; the world and interaction, and removing the focus from leveling/pt gaining<br/>
&gt; will provide a much more immersive and longerlasting environment for it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; users.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Being a merchant at heart - of course I&#39;d prefer to buy/trade<br/>
&gt; things rather<br/>
&gt; than go bash in some baddies skull directly. There is a whole nother<br/>
&gt; subgame to being a REAL merchant, if mechanics support it of course. NO<br/>
&gt; DROP is terrible for that, they would be a whole lot better served by<br/>
&gt; randomizing the spawn over an area or zone - than artificially saying -<br/>
&gt; well, if you pick this item up, you can&#39;t hand it to someone else - huh?<br/>
&gt; Breaking up drops over spawn is the only real solution to camping - and NO<br/>
&gt; DROP was the bandaid they slapped on that problem. And of course - users<br/>
&gt; will always find the most direct route to the cheese. We all know since<br/>
&gt; components are nodrop - lowerlevels can get them without<br/>
&gt; fighting, and much<br/>
&gt; lower risk simply by being in the right place at the right time - from<br/>
&gt; folks camping for xp, not the items. I ask you, what is the difference?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh well, enough rant for one day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I appreciate your advice on working on my coping skills, however, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;disagree.  I&#39;ve thought about this and what I&#39;m feeling is not<br/>
&gt; jealousy.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;am not jealous of the fact that he possesses full Lambent and<br/>
&gt; that I do not,<br/>
&gt; &gt;nor am I jealous of the fact that he has a set of Yaks, FBSS, Shimmering<br/>
&gt; &gt;Orb, etc.  There are many bards at my level and higher (and some<br/>
&gt; lower) that<br/>
&gt; &gt;have those things and I never give it a second thought.  No, what I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;feeling (and this is the crux of the matter) is resentment and<br/>
&gt; &gt;discouragement at the diminishment of my questing<br/>
&gt; accomplishments because he<br/>
&gt; &gt;has full Lambent at level 9.  Again, as I said, seeing this bard in full<br/>
&gt; &gt;steel would not have bothered me in the slightest, in fact it would have<br/>
&gt; &gt;made me feel *good* that my investment of time, effort and strategy had<br/>
&gt; &gt;yielding Lambent armor to me that he was unable to twink himself with but<br/>
&gt; &gt;instead had to earn with his bard through the same efforts.  As<br/>
&gt; I said in my<br/>
&gt; &gt;earlier post, I feel that wearing Lambent should automatically<br/>
&gt; reflect the<br/>
&gt; &gt;effort and time that I personally have put into my bard character by its<br/>
&gt; &gt;presence on my character&#39;s body.  This would occur if Lambent<br/>
&gt; armor was NO<br/>
&gt; &gt;DROP.<br/>
