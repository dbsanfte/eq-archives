Most of the ppl I see in lesser faydark are sitting outside of mistmoor <br/>
having zoned. Couple groups doing bandits usually at any time, maybe a <br/>
brownie group.<br/>
<br/>
The distance to run from Steamfont to Freater Gaydark is not nearly as long <br/>
as W Commons to RV or Highpass. Lesser Faydark is not nearly as high traffic <br/>
an area as Kithicor is considering Kith is the main path most non-gaters <br/>
take to get from FP to Qeynos and back.<br/>

&gt;I hate what they&#39;ve done to Kithicor. I personally don&#39;t mind the mobs as a<br/>
&gt;50th, but I made the mistake of going afk at RV zone with my druid and<br/>
&gt;someone trained 4 or 5 uber-skellies there. Luckily I got back in time to<br/>
&gt;zone. It&#39;s the location. They should&#39;ve put these mobs somewhere else like<br/>
&gt;in Lesser Faydark. I feel sorry for halfling newbies that don&#39;t have <br/>
&gt;friends<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lesser Faydark?  You gotta be kidding, then Gnomes would have no way out of<br/>
&gt;Steamfont.  That&#39;d be far worse as Lesser Fay has always had 5-10 times as<br/>
&gt;many people in it as Kithicor.  Not to mention there have always been some<br/>
&gt;undead in Kithicor so it fits the storyline far better there.<br/>
