<div id="ygrps-yiv-710641558">I made a typo with #1.  Meant to say melee/hybrids get the option to<br/>
accept/decline the bind similar to the resurrect spell.  This avoids<br/>
malicious binds deep in enemy territory.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I think one of Verant&#39;s concerns is that if they change the bind policy,<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; would be easier for groups to take out the uber-mobs like Lady Vox.<br/>
&gt; Melee/hybrid classes could just loot their corpse and reenter the battle.<br/>
&gt; What<br/>
&gt; if the rules were changed to reflect something like along these lines:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Any class can get bound anywhere.  Melee/hybrids get the option to<br/>
&gt; Players<br/>
&gt; without the bind spell<br/>
&gt; 2) If a character gets killed, and the mob that killed them is still alive<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; they reappear at their bind point,  that character can no longer do damage<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the mob.  This would not apply if the character was resurrected. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are probably several different ways this could be worked but I think<br/>
&gt; something along these lines would be required as a tradeoff for the change<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the binding policy <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Very good point.  From what I have gathered, it seems the biggest<br/>
&gt; complaint<br/>
&gt; &gt; about giving a melee class the ability to bind, or be bound by a caster,<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that it would change the fighting dynamic.  And it obviously would.<br/>
&gt; That<br/>
&gt; &gt; being said, the one major point that has not been proposed by other<br/>
&gt; players<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a sense of difficulty or loss with getting a melee player bound.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Add in song difficulty and reagents, coupled with real EXP loss to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; person getting bound (2 full bubbles of lost exp would really make a<br/>
&gt; melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; person question getting bound or not, of course the song singer should<br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; &gt; considerable less exp loss :=) ). and the argument becomes less clear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
