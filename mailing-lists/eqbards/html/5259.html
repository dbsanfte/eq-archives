<b>Subject:</b> Lullaby and interupting casting. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546532926">Here&#39;s my take on the whole issue.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure of this but this is just a couple of<br/>
observations I have made using lullaby extensively.<br/>
(Been using it a lot since I got it at level 15)<br/>
Every song pulses at every tick (6 seconds) as far as<br/>
I can tell. And lullaby/nod is no exception. I think<br/>
every time nod pulses the mob has to make a savings <br/>
check to see if it resists or not. Assume we have a<br/>
spell caster that resisted it, and then it begins <br/>
casting. If the casting does not take more than 6 <br/>
seconds, there is no chance that nod will be able to <br/>
interupt it. Since NPC casters do not suffer the same<br/>
casting time limitations as PC casters do, most are <br/>
able to get a spell off before the next pulse of nod <br/>
and hence can cast without being interupted. However,<br/>
sometimes when the mob resist nod, it attacks first and<br/>
then cast. When this happens, the attack and the casting<br/>
might not be complete within 6 seconds so when nod pulses <br/>
again and the mob fails the savings, then it is nodded<br/>
and it&#39;s casting is interupted. This is what I seem to<br/>
observe a lot. YMMV.<br/>
