<div id="ygrps-yiv-710579729">What I meant was - have the potions along and then you have a choice of<br/>
which to use: invis song or invis to undead potions.<br/>
<br/>
You are correct: you can not be invis and invis to undead at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if *all* bard songs cancel invis.  Mana song may not drop<br/>
others invis but other songs sure do.  There is an interaction between songs<br/>
and invis - I used to think any song pulsing would kill invis - but now I am<br/>
not sure exactly how they interact, so usually I stop all songs before they<br/>
invis up.<br/>

&gt; &gt;You can get invis to undead potions to supplement your invis or go with<br/>
&gt; &gt;someone who can cast it.  Or go with someone who can revive you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Um. 1) If you are singing a song, doesn&#39;t casting any sort of<br/>
&gt; invisibility on you get canceled by the next pulse of the song?<br/>
&gt; (The Invisibility is canceled, the icon stays up. Windsong&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; killed by someone with invisibility walking through her song radius,<br/>
&gt; then out again, blissfully thinking he was invis, and he wasn&#39;t. The<br/>
&gt; resulting<br/>
&gt; train killed both him and her)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (And no, you can&#39;t have both Invisibility and Invisibility to Undead<br/>
&gt; cast on you by someone else. The spells overwrite each other. Only one<br/>
&gt; is allowed) </span></blockquote></div>
