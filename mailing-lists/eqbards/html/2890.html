&gt; I have to disagree.  Verant in their ultimate wisdom have added flocks of<br/>
&gt; spectres to Oasis.  They sweep down the coastline faster than anyone can run<br/>
&gt; and kill dozens of players in one or two hits.  They are impossible to<br/>
&gt; escape and impossible it anticipate.<br/>

sweeping the coast, it&#39;s because some higher level players<br/>
foolishly/inconsiderately tried to attack them, and instead of<br/>
gracefully dying when they realized they were outmatched, ran<br/>
for the zone with spectres in tow, thus unleashing them on<br/>
everyone else.  I&#39;ve &quot;seen&quot; this happen once in probably 40+<br/>
hours of playtime in Oasis.  (I put &quot;seen&quot; in quotes because I<br/>
only heard it from the /shouts.)<br/>

The orcs tend to be on the mountain side of Oasis instead of<br/>
the ocean side anyway.  You can fight them by fetching and<br/>
pulling them to within a few steps of the North Ro zone.<br/>
