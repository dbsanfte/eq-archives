your corpse from his &quot;range of aggrivation&quot;. If you read my<br/>
example closely, you&#39;ll note that only the first pass was my<br/>
&quot;run through the zone&quot;. The others were me trying to recover<br/>
my corpse from a spot surrounded by pissed off Ogre&#39;s. I even<br/>
had invisibility cast on me by the only player willing to help<br/>
in the zone. They saw through it.</div>
