<b>Subject:</b> Suggestion posted at boards and 39th charm song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-562815256">Ive done some Giant charming in Dreadlands and I did not have any problems<br/>
getting them to obey. I dident even have to do a pet attack again when I<br/>
recharmed.<br/>
Currently Im fighting in Sol B and here I do have problems with Kobolds, a /pet<br/>
back off seems to help though :o)..<br/>
Btw i posted this suggestion on the board, I really would like to see our need<br/>
for twisting manually go away:<br/>

&gt;Gads. How awful. I did some Hill Giants in Rathe Mtns and didn&#39;t run into<br/>
&gt;this problem. They were very obedient. Guess I&#39;ll need to head out to<br/>
&gt;Dreadlands sometime soon.<br/>
