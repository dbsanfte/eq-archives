from threatening to dubious.  I then waltzed into the village<br/>
and looked around.  The merchants wouldn&#39;t sell to me.  I<br/>
could&#39;ve tried the sneak trick, but didn&#39;t want to risk it<br/>
somehow making me KOS to the guards again.<br/>

I wasn&#39;t able to do this when I was around L20.  They stayed<br/>
