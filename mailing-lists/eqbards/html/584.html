<div id="ygrps-yiv-442996496">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to start a new thread -- one that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with<br/>
fees or weapons and the like.  Does anyone, like me, when your group is<br/>
standing/sitting around healing, ever entertain their group mates with a<br/>
witty doggerel or some apt prose?<br/>
<br/>
I was a little rusty, having had a long vacation (2 weeks) from barding,<br/>
but I quickly got into the spirit.  To quell the long silences,<br/>
occasionally broken by a spellcaster casting yet another buff, then sitting<br/>
down to regenerate mana, I began to change the lyrics of songs that popped<br/>
into my head to match the moment.  (Ask me sometime, about my &quot;little ditty<br/>
about Watchman Prynn&quot;.)  Later on I began creating on the spot limericks<br/>
about my companions.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I plan to egg on my party with heroic quotes (checking Tolkien for<br/>
those) and beautiful tales.  Perhaps I&#39;ll try haiku, as well.<br/>
