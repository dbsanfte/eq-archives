		Well I have to say that I would probably enjoy grouping with<br/>
you Harm :-)  I always enjoy hearing suggestions on how to play better and<br/>
it&#39;s refreshing to find someone who is willing to give input but also has an<br/>
open mind.  I think you hit the nail on the head though...saying you&#39;re<br/>
always on the ball.  The times I&#39;ve had the most trouble are when people get<br/>
catatonic while playing (warriors who target, hit A and then go off to<br/>
polish their shoes, casters who fall asleep while medding, shaman who are<br/>
too busy flirting to fight (who, me?)....<br/>
<br/>
		This is why I do think Bards are the best group leaders...<br/>
doing their job requires them to always be moving and switching songs and<br/>
adapting, so they generally are much more aware of what is going on.<br/>
<br/>
		Damn I love this game :-)<br/>

<br/>
				  You&#39;ve also got to take into account the<br/>
monster being fought.<br/>
				  <br/>
				  Monster analysis:  Lava Duct Crawler.<br/>
<br/>
				  hp.......: several thousands.<br/>
				  attack...: double, kick, bash<br/>
				  dmg......: 110 max dmg, average 80.<br/>
				  special..: blood boil, hundreds of hp dot.<br/>
<br/>
				  This thing will (pardon the abbrev) F you<br/>
up big time if you let it.<br/>
				  And that&#39;s the key:  &#39;If you let it.&#39;<br/>
These things must absolutely<br/>
				  be stunned or slowed down first.<br/>
Malaising this thing and putting a<br/>
				  poison DoT on it only gonna piss it off<br/>
and it&#39;s still gonna be <br/>
				  pounding the crap out of someone.  We had<br/>
a cleric for healing,<br/>
				  the shaman would be more efficient as a<br/>
buff and debuff tool imo.<br/>
				  <br/>
				  Party dynamics and monster randomness<br/>
create many different <br/>
				  scenarios which you, the bard or<br/>
enchanter, need to pick up<br/>
				  on and adapt quickly to.  Having the<br/>
shaman finish at 20m and<br/>
				  the cleric at 80m creates downtime.  I try<br/>
to (and this is tough)<br/>
				  based on the mob fought and group makeup,<br/>
determine the best <br/>
				  role for everyone.  Am I perfect at it?<br/>
No way.  But it helps<br/>
				  everyone in the long run if they try<br/>
things out.  I am always<br/>
				  open to suggestions, although I usually<br/>
receive very little <br/>
				  input.  (Due to the more commanding role<br/>
maybe?)  I am always<br/>
				  on the ball when I play, so much so that<br/>
people are like can<br/>
				  you please play the manasong... and I&#39;m<br/>
like that&#39;s what you&#39;ve<br/>
				  been hearing for the last 5 mins &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
Some people just cannot<br/>
				  keep up with us sometimes.  ;)<br/>
