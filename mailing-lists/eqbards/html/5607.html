<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491224677">it is a singing song only.  i assume twisting will slow it down slightly, as<br/>
its pulses will be a bit further apart.  i very rarely play this other than<br/>
after a fight during rest.  during the battle the song just can&#39;t keep up<br/>
with the mana use of the casters.  maybe in really desparate cases i&#39;ll<br/>
start it up in a fight just in case someone can get one extra heal off.<br/>
basically i do my normal in fight stuff (whatever that may be for each of<br/>
us) and then play mana song alone during rest.  it is usually in the hands<br/>
of the healers to get your health back up.  i have used hymn very rarely<br/>
since level 32 if healers are in the group, which they usually have to be<br/>
if you are doing anything remotely dangerous hehe.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a couple question about mana song.I have just<br/>
&gt; reached 32 level and wanted to know the do`s and dont<br/>
&gt; of this song.Does an instrument make it more powerful<br/>
&gt; than just singing?Dose twisting with other song effect<br/>
&gt; its help of mana recovery? Can it be twisted in battle<br/>
&gt; to help mana recovery ?<br/>
&gt; Basicly i just want to no what other bards are doing?<br/>
