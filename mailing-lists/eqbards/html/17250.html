<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574534986">Speaking of building a new machine, what do you recommend as far as hardware<br/>
is concerned for a relatively high-end system that EQ will run well on?  <br/>
<br/>
I currently use Dual SLI Voodoo2 cards and glide drivers and I know there<br/>
are issues with Mip mapping, gamma correction, and clip plane on other<br/>
chipsets (TnT?). What would be the best choice AGP 3d hardware out there<br/>
these days in everyone&#39;s opinion?<br/>
<br/>
I also hear all kinds of problems with the Soundblaster 3d live cards that<br/>
we have discussed here, what do people in general feel is the best sound<br/>
hardware solution?<br/>
<br/>
Sometime within the next few months I too hope to upgrade from my current<br/>
Pii333 PCI bus machine to a whiz-bang platform but with all the choices I&#39;m<br/>
not sure what direction to go in.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is pretty off topic but if anyone has any sound advice I<br/>
would greatly appreciate it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay, I know that the theory says that 3 songs should be <br/>
&gt; &gt; optimized, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have been weaving 4 when soloing out of a vague feeling <br/>
&gt; that the total<br/>
&gt; &gt; effect was most beneficial (at level 24-26 it&#39;s been DDD, <br/>
&gt; CoD, Chains,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hymn). With the new DoT messages it appears that I can keep <br/>
&gt; &gt; everything going<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the DoTs wear off as I am starting the new DoT. (I play <br/>
&gt; &gt; on a P2 266 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; 56K modem and this is still no problem most places). Am I <br/>
&gt; &gt; missing something<br/>
&gt; &gt; still?<br/>
