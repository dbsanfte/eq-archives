&gt;&gt; Well thats my point, once cazic learns you are in the pof, he starts willy<br/>
&gt;&gt; nilly zapping people. The trick is to not let him know you are the in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; zone, and that means being very carefull about not creating situations<br/>
&gt;&gt; where autopull happens and letting mobs get away that know you are in the <br/>
&gt;zone. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does he do it before all other tactics when you&#39;re fighting<br/>
&gt;him?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure i understand what you are asking... If you get into a situation<br/>
where autopull is happening cazic can be on the other side of the zone and<br/>
will just start DTing people. Since just about everybody interacts with<br/>
everybody else in one shape or fashion everybody is on his agro list then.<br/>
You have to gate out or just wait for your turn on the list then (or camp<br/>
out) to clear agro. Now after the zone is completly cleared of everything<br/>
but cazic and everybody makes their rush at him he will continue to DT<br/>
people and pets while fighting him. I have had this melee DT punch right<br/>
through my necromancer&#39;s harmshield, so i have no clue how you could do a<br/>
fight against cazic and suffer NO casulties.</div>
