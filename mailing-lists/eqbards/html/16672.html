<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080295199">Okies, I&#39;ll take your word for it.  I just haven&#39;t found Divine Aura (Same<br/>
Duration) to make that much difference.  A Divine Aura with the same refresh<br/>
limitations that was party based might be interesting for a song though.<br/>

&gt; You&#39;re still using the song at that level for Haste effect?  I was under<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; impression Alacrity was a 40% speedup and that&#39;s available long before<br/>
that.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a little confused now.  Aren&#39;t there already speedups that are nearly<br/>
&gt; that good, just not bard speedups, that last for far longer than 18 secs?<br/>
<br/>
IIRC, enchanter Alacrity was a 25% reduction in delay.  <br/>
Enchanter Celerity was a 30% reduction in delay.  Bard<br/>
Celerity was about a 15% reduction in delay, Beserkers was<br/>
about 17% at 48.<br/>
<br/>
The speedups tend to be rather expensive for enchanters to<br/>
cast, and last about 5-10 minutes.  Buffing four tanks with<br/>
SLTW wipes out a bit more than half a typical enchanter&#39;s mana<br/>
(takes about 2-3 minutes to get it back with their own<br/>
Clarity).  Usually, most of them just stick with Augmentation<br/>
(15% reduction in delay) unless there&#39;s a big fight brewing.<br/>
<br/>
And like I explained, the double damage portion of the<br/>
proposed song more than made up for the short duration IMHO.<br/>
