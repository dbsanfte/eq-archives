<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145665395"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;- The song will place you at ground level, which for bodies of water<br/>
&gt;  means at the bottom.  If it&#39;s dark and/or the water is murky, you can<br/>
&gt;  easily become disoriented and drown before reaching the surface.  So<br/>
&gt;  make sure you consider this possibility if you&#39;re using it near water.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also found that, at least in Kithicor,  once in the water it would never<br/>
teleport me out. Ya it could have been a bad run on the number generator,<br/>
but in an hour or more of random teleports (*laughs*, so I was bored and<br/>
didn&#39;t know I couldn&#39;t go through walls) once I hit the water I stayed.<br/>
Still, it might have been that wacky random number generator.<br/>
