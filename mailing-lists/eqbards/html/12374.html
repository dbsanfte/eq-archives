Which is better:<br/>
<br/>
Chords, Bellow, Anthem<br/>
<br/>
or <br/>
<br/>
constant singing of Fulfil&#39;s Curtailing (also factor in resists)?  If<br/>
maximum damage is your goal?<br/>
<br/>
Standard songs in choice one have lower standard resist rates because they<br/>
are &#39;vintage&#39; and have level * x powers.<br/>
<br/>
But what I do think a consideration should be is whether your party is &quot;tank<br/>
hvy&quot; or &quot;caster hvy.&quot;  Bard is a party buffer so song choices should be made<br/>
with respect to the other classes in the party.  With 3 tanks, healer, bard,<br/>
caster; or 3 tanks (one is a bard), healer, ench/sha, caster - I would buff<br/>
the tanks.  With 2 pure casters, 2 tanks, bard, healer, I would buff the<br/>
casters (by debuffin&#39; the mobs.)<br/>
<br/>
And yes - you have to keep playing it - that was my point exactly.  But<br/>
there have been situations where I tried using it to debuff the mobs for my<br/>
benefit. Ie, I was using bellow and getting high resist rates so I tried<br/>
twisting Fulfil&#39;s with bellow - knowing that I had to make the next pulse to<br/>
benefit from the MR debuff. My thinking was I can time the follow up attack<br/>
better than party casters.  <br/>
<br/>
Most bards can play 2 songs for fights - some can do 3.  Even so, playing<br/>
any one song means not playing another one from a pretty good set of<br/>
choices.  To get into a situation where you concentrate on one song only -<br/>
has got to be pretty specific and pretty important.  Ie to give up benefit<br/>
of 2 songs because you can only play one or need to keep playing the same<br/>
one.  One situation like this is the multiple mob pull and bard does crowd<br/>
control with pixie strike.  Two mean mobs need your full attention.<br/>
<br/>
But unless you have casters that are going to see significant results from<br/>
the MR debuff (cmon 30some dmg over 3 rounds is pretty minimal damage) - to<br/>
drop to one song only from 2 songs is a hard choice.<br/>

MR for 2 pulses.<br/>

it stick (ie mobs<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
