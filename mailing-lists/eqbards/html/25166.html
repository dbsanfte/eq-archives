I think they really are trying to go out of their way and compromise on a<br/>
few things that they have high customer demand for. If they dont, we&#39;ll all<br/>
start wanting to play AO.<br/>

&gt; When Verant does a 180 on a position that was once supposedly <br/>
&gt; &quot;carved in<br/>
&gt; stone&quot; - you gotta bet that there is a great deal of demand from the<br/>
&gt; customer base motivating them. Or maybe just a new, &quot;kinder, gentler&quot;<br/>
&gt; management team - who knows!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally, I think it is a great idea.  I have 4 accounts <br/>
&gt; and 2 PC&#39;s.  If I<br/>
&gt; am not driving 2 char&#39;s, I actually feel like something is <br/>
&gt; missing and I do<br/>
&gt; spend most of my time in 6 person groups doing exp or events. <br/>
&gt;  At times, I<br/>
&gt; have really wished that  certain characters were on other <br/>
&gt; accounts for ease<br/>
&gt; of teleporting. My &quot;mains&quot; are 60 Bard, 60 Cleric, 52 <br/>
&gt; Enchanter, and  51<br/>
&gt; Wizard.  The wizard account happens to have a rogue that I <br/>
&gt; would like to<br/>
&gt; level up sometime in the near future and teleports are <br/>
&gt; obviously not as<br/>
&gt; convenient as they could be. So this is a good thing for me.  <br/>
&gt; Btw, I am<br/>
&gt; actually thinking of getting a 3rd PC - probably not for <br/>
&gt; playing 3 at the<br/>
&gt; same time - except for teleporting and maybe powerleveling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as unsavory characters inflicting pain and suffering <br/>
&gt; on unsuspecting<br/>
&gt; groups, we already have plenty of that.  It&#39;s called &quot;A normal day in<br/>
&gt; Sebilis.&quot;  If they transfer to a new server, they should be <br/>
&gt; pretty easy to<br/>
&gt; spot.  They will be wearing that new kind of armor: Emperor Armor*<br/>

&gt; Somewhere on Innoruuk....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * do you mean to say that you have not seen the Emperor&#39;s new <br/>
&gt; armor?  ;)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure if it is funny or sad.  I do hope we don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; suddenly see a bunch<br/>
&gt; of characters who couldn&#39;t get in a group on their old server <br/>
&gt; due to their<br/>
&gt; unsavory ways suddenly dropped on unsuspecting high level <br/>
&gt; groups elsewhere.<br/>
