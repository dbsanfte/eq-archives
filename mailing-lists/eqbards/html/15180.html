<b>Subject:</b> Re: Hello! and Looking for advice on Mask of Deception <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143059724">I just got my mask the other day, being it was only the 2nd real time I&#39;ve<br/>
been in LGuk (first was to get the Lambent Quest items).  Overcrowding is so<br/>
unbearable there that I found other places to hunt.  In your case, the<br/>
overcrowdedness works in your favor... you probably have a decent chance of<br/>
walking unscathed all the way from the dead side entrance to the assassin<br/>
room.  People down there are extremelly nice about the mask.  I was unlucky<br/>
enough to get there on a night when 3 people were already in line to loot<br/>
it.  (The Bard ahead of me was level 15)  About 20 mins before I was<br/>
planning to log for the night I got the tell saying that mine was there!<br/>
<br/>
Couple of suggestions...<br/>
Get a map.  A GREAT guide to lguk is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://monks.volitionx.com/">http://monks.volitionx.com/</a>  The<br/>
maps are kind of confusing in certain areas due to the multi-levels of the<br/>
dungeon so be careful.  You will have to climb a ladder to enter the room<br/>
(it&#39;s not depicted on the map)<br/>
<br/>
Get Invis to Undead.  If you have a friend that can cast Invis to Undead and<br/>
doesn&#39;t mind blowing a few hours you&#39;re much better off.  Most people are<br/>
really cool about giving out invis to undead (I guess it&#39;s either be nice<br/>
about it, or suffer the trains... :), but for what you&#39;re there for, I&#39;d try<br/>
to be as unneedy as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Go naked.  You probably won&#39;t be joining the assassin group, just patiently<br/>
waiting in the room, so if something bad does happen, you&#39;re free to give up<br/>
and try again later.  Maybe bring extra food and water for the group camping<br/>
that room... extra plat to trade for their gold?<br/>
<br/>
I would shout upon entering the zone to find out who is camping the<br/>
Assassin, then ask politely in tells if they mind you not only looting, but<br/>
sitting in the room while you wait.<br/>
<br/>
The Assassin or PlaceHolder spawns every 35 - 40 minutes, so you could have<br/>
a long wait.. especially if there&#39;s already a line for the mask.  But, it is<br/>
the common drop, so the first Assassin that pops, most likely is carrying<br/>
it. :)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this info helps.  I know the guide definately will. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hello all!<br/>
&gt; I have been reading this list for about 3 months now and thanks to you all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a level 15 half-bard and am absolutly loving him. This is a very<br/>
helpful,fun, and informative list. Seeing that I just reached 15 I would<br/>
love to try on a mask of deception. I looked through the archives and did<br/>
not find much. Would anyone please point me in the way of current info on<br/>
this or maybe give me some suggestions as I take on the mission for it this<br/>
weekend. I know that basically I need to find my way down to lower guk and<br/>
ask to loot it off the ghoul assassin there that it is a common drop on. I&#39;m<br/>
scared to death though. Should I go naked and maybe bring a mandolin to sing<br/>
heal for a group? Any advice would be awesome.<br/>
