<b>Subject:</b> Psalm of cooling query <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-991115481">Ususally when I hunt with a druid I use Psalm of Cooling as an additional damage shield (Since most good druids will DS the main tank...)  But hunting seafury cyclops the other day I noticed the &quot;a Seafury Cyclops is chilled to the bone&quot; message wasn&#39;t posting.<br/>
<br/>
Curious to see if this was a stealth nerf, I tried it out on a few other mobs...(gnolls and a corrupt guard) and saw the message show just fine...has anyone else run into this?  Are Seafuries imune to cold shields?   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
