<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-368387336">Shada - I would like to add it, though. I wanted to make an additional list <br/>
of bard-specific weapons and armour for the next FAQ.<br/>
Also, what site do you recommend I link to for the best information?  (ie, <br/>
Allakhazam&#39;s, Baelish&#39;s, EQLizer?)<br/>
So the next FAQ will be out tuesday methinks...<br/>
