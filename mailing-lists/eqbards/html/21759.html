<div id="ygrps-yiv-810305755">Oh the man question is easy to answer.  Hybrid casting is such a tiny<br/>
fraction of their overall balance that adjusting upwards has an<br/>
insignificant effect on their overall power level.  Basically they are<br/>
admitting that hybrid spells are pretty much just fluff.<br/>

Its typical Verant-speak.  They answer questions like a presidential<br/>
candidate, don&#39;t accept blame, make vague promises, and try not to offend<br/>
anyone.<br/>
<br/>
How could mobs possibly be balanced both before and after a significant<br/>
change?<br/>
<br/>
Its like when they gave hybrids all that extra mana.  How possibly could<br/>
hybrids been balanced on both sides of a significant upgrade?<br/>
<br/>
It never ceases to amaze me that a company that A) makes this much money, B)<br/>
is very dependent on good relations with its customers has never bothered to<br/>
hire a competent PR person.<br/>
