<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401292589">Yes, they get lots better.  Actually a couple things change for you over the<br/>
next 10 levels.<br/>
<br/>
First off, resists are checked against level difference.  Try it on some<br/>
blues and it should work better.  I tried it on Broon my first time out and<br/>
was very dissappointed in the results - resisted fear and denon&#39;s - I gave<br/>
up until 35+ when I went after Aviak Avocets with a vengence.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, as you go up in levels so do the mobs.  They hit a whole lot<br/>
harder.  So, you really can&#39;t stand toe-toe with mobs like you used to.  You<br/>
need to fear them off and attack them when they are not hitting you.  But<br/>
you need to have a level difference advantage and need to have the song for<br/>
a few levels for it to really gain power. Also, finding the &quot;right&quot; mobs -<br/>
ones with low magic hence song resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it gets better - I am sorry I missed what I think would have been a lot<br/>
of good opportunities.  I tried it when i first got the song - had poor<br/>
results and ignored it for too many levels.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] fear kiting<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve only had screech for a little while but have<br/>
&gt; found that two or three resists and I take huge<br/>
&gt; amounts of damage from a very angry mob when fear<br/>
&gt; kiting.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do these songs get better over time or am I doomed to<br/>
&gt; resist hell?  I know I must be missing something<br/>
&gt; because others have been successful at kiting...what<br/>
&gt; am I doing wrong? </span></blockquote></div>
