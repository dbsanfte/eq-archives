<div id="ygrps-yiv-73029786">Actually, I started with a Giant Snake Fang (back at level 9) to raise my<br/>
piercing skill. I got lucky, and got a dirk for free at level 10, and have<br/>
been using it ever since. I was using a mino axe before, and let me tell<br/>
you, it&#39;s real nice not to take Stamina loss during combat...<br/>

&gt; Little did I know that peircing was such an important skill for Bard&#39;s  I<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; for all of you people complaining about some of the dungeons being<br/>
&gt; incredibly over camped, Go to Permafrost!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Permafrost is one of the only zones in the game that will be sometimes<br/>
&gt; deserted in EQ&#39;s peak hours, there are all sorts of mobs in there ranging<br/>
&gt; from level 15-Lady Vox, and the loot is mainly Medium Bronze armor which<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should I start using the Dragoon dirk as my primary weapon to gain peirce<br/>
&gt; skill or should I invest in a FS rapier instead??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where should a person of my level be fighting? I don&#39;t really care about<br/>
&gt; where it is on the world as travel is quite easy for me ).  BlackBurrow is<br/>
&gt; becoming quite boring, I found Crushbone to be overcamped and not really<br/>
&gt; worthwhile.  Are places like dagnor&#39;s cauldron or Lavastorm safe for me??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and lastly  what are some really good &quot;weaving, juggling, twisting, or<br/>
&gt; medlying&quot; methods??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. can anyone send me a copy of that list of Bard song&#39;s that has the<br/>
&gt; locations, and uses<br/>

&gt; who&#39;s big mouth has landed him in trouble more often than not<br/>
