<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765746567"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; First of all, it&#39;s bad players, not bad classes.  Period.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YUP!!!  Agreed 100%<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually the Bard is the 2nd or 3rd best Solo Class.  Especially after level<br/>
26 and 27.  And even before that you can easily solo any blue with a well<br/>
played bard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, Mage&#39;s, Necro&#39;s, Druids<br/>
&gt; all have a slight disadvantage in that they can solo, so they might<br/>
&gt; not pick up the group acceptable behaviors along the way, while Bards<br/>
&gt; are generally forced to group and thus forced to figure out HOW to<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above.  Bards are, hands down, one of THE best solo classes in the game.<br/>
We are also one of the best GROUP classes.  My bard can out-solo a magician<br/>
any day of the week until a magician hits level 40 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Your points are valid regarding players who solo rather than group.  However<br/>
I dissagree that casters have a harder time learning to solo.  Bards are<br/>
easily as powerful (and in many cases far more powerful) as any caster at<br/>
Solo play except perhaps the Necromancer and Druid classes yet we learn to<br/>
operate in groups just fine.  Many people, even bards, don&#39;t realize just<br/>
how powerful we are as a Solo class.   Even Druids and Necros have a hard<br/>
time soloing hill giants.  Yet a bard can do it easily enough starting at<br/>
around level 30 if we have 2 giants.<br/>
<br/>
I agree completely that it&#39;s the player, not the class, that makes ANY<br/>
character good, or bad, in a group.  I have grouped with good magicians, bad<br/>
magicians and the whole range in between.  Same goes for EVERY other class<br/>
in the game, including bards.  In fact, I&#39;d honestly say, I&#39;ve met more bad<br/>
bard players than any other class barring Necros.  (And they DO have a<br/>
harder time learning to group because nobody wants a necro -until recently-)<br/>
