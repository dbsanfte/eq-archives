<b>Subject:</b> Question about 30th level song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363886231">Rokenn&#39;s song analysis for the 30th level song says that even though the<br/>
song lists percussion as the supporting instrument, equipping a drum doesn&#39;t<br/>
increase the damage of the DOT or raise the amount of magic resistance the<br/>
mobs loses.  Is this still true?  If so, has anyone submitted it as a bug?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

they see the &quot;hair stands on its end&quot; message)<br/>
