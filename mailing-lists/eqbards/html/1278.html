<b>Subject:</b> Re: h2h skill cap 40 for lvl 12 HEF bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-473666837">Yes, most bard skills are capped at 40. I did not know about h2h(damm<br/>
wanted to train in that too), but 2handers are capped at 1, tracking at<br/>
1, forage at 40, pick lock at 40, hide at 40, sneak at 40, disarm traps<br/>
at 40. Safe fall, instill doubt, and bind wound are probably too. Corect<br/>
me if I&#39;m wrong. The only thing we aren&#39;t capped in are the basic weapon<br/>
skills(cept mentioned), instrument and singing skills, dual wield,<br/>
offense and defense, (though it seems to be 5 pts behind your level,<br/>
I&#39;ve been at 90 forever at level 18), and language skills. Its the price<br/>
of being a bard heh. About best weapon...I personally used a dwarven axe<br/>
from 5 to well...using it now. Its got a nice 6 dam 26 delay. Very good<br/>
weapon, plus has same time between attacks as my polished granite<br/>
tomhawk, which is helpful in seeing when dual wield fails.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I level 12 HEF - skill level is &quot;bad&quot;, guildmaster(s) says &quot;trained to the<br/>
&gt; max limit&quot; - does that mean that hand to hand skill caps at 40? Or is it<br/>
&gt; graduated level cap, where at higher levels the cap will rise unlike the LVL<br/>
&gt; * 5 + 5 formula that seems to work for sense heading, swimming, 1H slashing,<br/>
&gt; etc ...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If 40 is skill cap then I am extremely disappointed because that means that<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t ever be able to be instrument wielding bard in combat ... if true,<br/>
&gt; is it also true for human bard? I wish I would have access to this type of<br/>
&gt; game documentation instead it&#39;s holed up inside some Verant programmer&#39;s<br/>
&gt; skull ...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And weapons is another story ... is 1H slashing capped at some point? What<br/>
&gt; is best bard weapon ... I spent 10 practices in piercing and got giant snake<br/>
&gt; fang but did I just waste practices?<br/>
