<div id="ygrps-yiv-623060298">Training languages from scratch is a MAJOR pain in the butt - but it can be<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
I have Excellent in over 20 languages - don&#39;t think I&#39;m missing any - some<br/>
more that are slightly lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
What you need is a partner - perferably one that already is a lot higher in<br/>
that language than you - you group and spam them for a few minutes - then<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
That said - you CAN start with 1 pt - just takes forever. You can teach 1<br/>
pt more than you know. Teach, gain, gain - zone - rinse repeat with the<br/>
other party giving you the spamming.<br/>
<br/>
Told ya it was a major pain.<br/>

&gt;&gt; No, if you train at your GM for one point you don&#39;t get Excellent.  :)<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I have not tested it, but I assume you get (level at which the skill <br/>
&gt;&gt; appeared on the trainer&#39;s list) + 1 skill points, which translates to <br/>
&gt;&gt; awful or some such (don&#39;t remember the category names, but suffice it to <br/>
&gt;&gt; say, you stink at it.  hehe)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then please clear something up for those of us who don&#39;t fully<br/>
&gt;understand this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Given:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Your skill is awful when you first train it.<br/>
&gt;- You need a teacher who is excellent to train it up to excellent.<br/>
&gt;- Everyone started the game at level 1 and awful at everything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How did the first person who got a language skill to excellent<br/>
&gt;get it to excellent?<br/>
