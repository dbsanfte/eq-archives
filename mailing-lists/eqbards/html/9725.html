&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your level 8 song will help you when you want to fight only one mob<br/>
&gt; at a<br/>
&gt; time but there are other mobs near him and an attack would normally<br/>
&gt; pull all<br/>
&gt; of the mobs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SO, you use your song to target each of the weaker mobs in the group<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; Lament them (or &quot;lull&quot; them not to be confused with lullaby which<br/>
&gt; &quot;sleeps&quot;<br/>
&gt; them.)  The lament or lull reduces their &quot;agro&quot; or agressiveness so<br/>
&gt; that an<br/>
&gt; attack on the highest one will pull only the highest one for you or<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; party to fight and kill.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You lull the weak ones first so that the chance of a resist is lower.<br/>
&gt;  The<br/>
&gt; higher the mob the more likely of a resist and a subsequent attack. <br/>
&gt; Be<br/>
&gt; ready to run!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lament is a target song - you target and lamant each weaker one. <br/>
&gt; Then<br/>
&gt; attack the strongest one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pre-combat crowd controll.  Great for gnolls, bandit, orc and derv<br/>
&gt; camps.<br/>
&gt; You may need to get a few more level before you will fight many<br/>
&gt; bigger orcs<br/>
&gt; and dervs. <br/>
