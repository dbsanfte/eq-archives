<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426511188">We played around with SoT and mez and what it seemed to us was that,<br/>
whichever ends first will break the mez.  Song and spell will both stick,<br/>
but as soon as one duration expires, both expire...  I found that pretty<br/>
weird...    I have no idea why they dont let the enchanter mez just<br/>
overwrite the bard mez, that would really give bards something to do on<br/>
raids, as we could spot mez a big pull while the enchanters are locking down<br/>
all the mobs.  Not to mention let us save an enchanter&#39;s bacon when they get<br/>
agroed...<br/>
