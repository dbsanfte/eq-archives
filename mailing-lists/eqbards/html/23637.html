<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418941425">Well for one, using Pixie to make the group face 1 mob at a time instead of<br/>
3 would be better.  On a damage inflicted basis the damage shields just<br/>
don&#39;t cut it.  If you&#39;re already fighting the whole room you can fire up<br/>
Denon&#39;s or Chord&#39;s and do more damage than you will with the Psalms.<br/>
Denon&#39;s would be especially helpful since it lowers AC as well.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t see where the damage shield songs will ever outdamage our other damage<br/>
inflicting songs, they are just too weak.  It&#39;s so bad that the lvl 2 Chords<br/>
is better damage-wise if you don&#39;t have to worry about aggroing mezzed mobs,<br/>
if there are mezzed mobs and you&#39;re fighting a single Bellow does comparable<br/>
damage even.  If there&#39;s no enchanter the 10%+ haste from Anthem will do<br/>
more damage over time than the damage shields.  With an enchanter the dmg<br/>
shields might be an option sometimes.  Without an enchater though there is<br/>
no way I would sing damage shield, it just doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>

In the instance he described, there was no ench. If there is a better song<br/>
to play, tell us what it is.  Just because some other class has a better<br/>
damage shield, that is not a reason to just instantly dismiss bard&#39;s damage<br/>
shield songs. Also depending on the level of the bard -  there might not be<br/>
that many other better options.  You can be 31 and be in assn room or you<br/>
can be 44 - big difference in what your choices are. <br/>
<br/>
Point is, he gave us a specific situation, I answered with some points about<br/>
the specific songs.  Please share, but be specific about what songs a - say<br/>
33 - bard could use for that room - given the group he was in.<br/>

I&#39;ve always had a problem with our damage shields actually.  Unless you are<br/>
being attacked by multiple mobs, which with an enchanter doesn&#39;t happen too<br/>
often, the damage output of the shields is sub-par.  We have several other<br/>
options which produce more damage per 6 second pulse.  About the only time<br/>
we&#39;ve used the damage shields was in multi-bard groups.  There&#39;s almost<br/>
always a better song to play than a damage shield<br/>
