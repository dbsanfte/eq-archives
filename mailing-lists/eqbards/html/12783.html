<br/>
I am in The Revolution.  Doing<br/>
<br/>
/w all the revolution<br/>
<br/>
will return The Erudin Arcanium, as they are alphabetically higher.<br/>
However, if I do<br/>
<br/>
/w all &quot;the revolution&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I will get what I am looking for.<br/>
<br/>
(N.B. Abbreviating works, /w all &quot;the rev&quot; works identically.)<br/>
