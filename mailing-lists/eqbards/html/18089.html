<br/>
Most of the time, I use the 1st person view.  I will switch to the <br/>
3rd person view when outdoors and doing AOE.  I have never used the <br/>
top-down view.  I do use the behind the back view a lot lately.  <br/>
Makes kiting those Troll Guards in Rathe Mtns a bit easier.  I will <br/>
zoom back a good bit (right mouse button and drag back), then zoom it <br/>
up so I have a better forward view as well.  (Alt Up/Down will move <br/>
the camera up down in the behind the back view).  This view always me <br/>
to keep tabs via two methods.  Visual as well as audio.  I can &quot;hear&quot; <br/>
the mob better since sounds are based on camera position versus <br/>
avatar position.  With the lag I have been getting lately, I can <br/>
usually hear when my Chains has worn off/taken effect well before I <br/>
get the appropriate message. <br/>
<br/>
I rarely use the mouse for movement ever since I jumped (something <br/>
startled me) and next thing I knew I was drowning in Sol A Lava 8).  <br/>
Find mouse targeting a must when try to mesmerize multiple targets <br/>
with Pixie Strike.  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily, I learned how to use songs on hotkeys at a very young age.  <br/>
Hotkeys in conjunction with the mouse can actually work like 7 <br/>
hotkeys for me.  I just move the mouse over the non-hotkeyed song <br/>
icon and leave it there for those times I might need that particular <br/>
song.<br/>

My <br/>
&gt; coordination and reflexes were never that hot (which is why I <br/>
sucked at <br/>
&gt; sports), and they seem to get worse with age.  Plus, I&#39;ve usually <br/>
played <br/>
&gt; turn-based strategy games.  And, in agreement with the &quot;can&#39;t teach <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; old dog new tricks&quot; axiom, I&#39;ve been playing this game in the <br/>
default <br/>
&gt; first-person mode, using the keyboard for everything but targetting <br/>
MOBs. <br/>
&gt; (It took me until level 40 to switch from using the mouse for song <br/>
&gt; activation to setting up hot keys, which shows you how stuck in old <br/>
&gt; habits I can get.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering how the rest of you play.  Do you use the other <br/>
views, and <br/>
&gt; if so, for what purposes?  I&#39;ve been playing with the mid-range <br/>
&gt; third-person view for soloing for about a month, but I&#39;m having a <br/>
lot of <br/>
&gt; trouble using it in group situations.  Does this just take <br/>
practice?  <br/>
&gt; Does anyone use the &quot;behind the back&quot; view for any reason other <br/>
than <br/>
&gt; aesthetics?  My avatar constantly gets in the way on that one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, do you use your mouse for movement?  Do you actually feel <br/>
that you <br/>
&gt; have better control than with the keyboard, or is this the inverse <br/>
of my <br/>
&gt; situation (e.g., you always used the mouse, so the keyboard seems <br/>
&gt; awkward)?<br/>
