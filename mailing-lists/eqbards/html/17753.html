now....where would the local magic shop be in the GF/BB area?<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t want to be quite so dirty, I&#39;d drag the pet away,<br/>
&gt; &gt; run back and attack the mage, drag the pet away again when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; returns, repeat.  You can use Warsong and melee to hope to<br/>
&gt; &gt; interrupt his casting, or Accel to try to get out of range<br/>
&gt; &gt; before his spell fires (note that neither consumes mana, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;d be relying on fizzles to deplete his mana).  And if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pet roots you...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; pumice stones - dont leave home without one<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The key I think is that you can stay out of attack range and<br/>
&gt; &gt; heal indefinitely, while he cannot (gotta run out of bandages<br/>
&gt; &gt; some time).<br/>
