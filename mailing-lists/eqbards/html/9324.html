<div id="ygrps-yiv-850057723">Exactly my opinion.  The deviation curve requires an order of magnitude<br/>
increase for results to meet the minimum for accuracy of +/- 1% At 71 with a<br/>
range of 100 (percentile) the deviation range is something more in the<br/>
neighborhood of 15%.  Any result with less than a 15% difference is<br/>
therefore invalid.  All his results showed less than 15% difference<br/>
rendering them all invalid.  Since the &#39;perfect&#39; result is likely less than<br/>
15% in any event, the sample size would have to be large enough for a<br/>
standard deviation of 1 to be larger than the &#39;perfect&#39; resultant difference<br/>
noted.  This means that doing less than 1000 tests, enough for a 1%<br/>
variation to be detected consistently, is not really bona fide.<br/>

Anyway, speaking as someone who does this sort of testing professionally, I<br/>
can tell you that<br/>
this person did a lot of work into the test, but personally, I wouldn&#39;t take<br/>
the results to the<br/>
bank.<br/>
<br/>
The main reason is that he just didn&#39;t have a big enough sample size, in my<br/>
opinion.  His<br/>
smallest test case had only 71 attempted hits, and of those, only 55% hit.<br/>
That combined with<br/>
the variability of the possible results (1 damage to 39 damage) makes it<br/>
quite possible for<br/>
random variation to infuence the results more than they should.<br/>
<br/>
For example: We all know that the numeric mean of rolling a six sided die is<br/>
3.5.  If you rolled<br/>
a 6 sided die an infinite number of times, assuming the die is perfectly<br/>
balanced, you should get<br/>
a mean of 3.5 -- but you don&#39;t need to do it that many times.  The way<br/>
randomness works means<br/>
that you can roll it a lesser number of times, and depending on how many<br/>
times you roll that die,<br/>
be PRETTY sure that the result you get will accurately reflect the true<br/>
result.  That&#39;s what<br/>
statistics and probabability is all about.<br/>
<br/>
Now, using the 6 sided die, if you rolled it 71 times, would you get 3.5 as<br/>
the mean?  I&#39;d guess<br/>
probably.  71 times is a lot of rolls when there are only 6 possible<br/>
results.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you roll it 71 times and it&#39;s a 40 sided die, do you<br/>
think you&#39;d get the<br/>
true mean of 20.5?   Maybe.... but I&#39;d expect a result something in the<br/>
neighbourhood of 18-24.<br/>
That&#39;s the effect of variability.  And this test didn&#39;t even get 71 hits, he<br/>
got 39.  Do you<br/>
think you could roll a 40 sided die and get an accurate reading of the<br/>
average roll with 39<br/>
tries?  Try rolling a six sided die 5 times and seeing if you get an average<br/>
of 3.5.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve taken a lot of stats courses, you&#39;ll know what I mean by the<br/>
concept of &quot;power&quot;.  Power<br/>
determines the size of sample you&#39;ll need to get within a certain allowable<br/>
variability.  I could<br/>
whip out my stats book and figure out the power needed to get an acceptable<br/>
result for this<br/>
test... but to be honest, I hate stats, so I&#39;ll wimp out.  :)<br/>
<br/>
These tests MAY be valid, but given the weird results, I would take them<br/>
with a grain of salt.<br/>
The person may be on to something here, I won&#39;t deny it, but I&#39;d like to see<br/>
the test repeated<br/>
and compare the results.<br/>
