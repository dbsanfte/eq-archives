Waves seem to work better because I suspect he slows down on<br/>
his spellcasting (possibly his breath attack too) as he gets<br/>
lower in mana.  If you only have part of your group take the<br/>
brunt of the initial attack, the rest can join in later waves<br/>
when he&#39;s not doing as much AE damage.<br/>
