I happen to LIKE most of our songs.  Even after 20 I find uses for almost<br/>
all of them.  There are 2 or 3 that I have yet to use but I can think of<br/>
situations that they might be useful (though rare).<br/>
<br/>
If every song was &quot;awesome&quot; We&#39;d never know what to play.  And I&#39;ve NEVER<br/>
had a problem getting my songs to stick (except Lullaby)<br/>

&gt; &gt; So basically Chains is like bards in general?  An afterthought that&#39;s<br/>
nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; to have when the real spells fail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I get a strong idea that GZ&#39;s well ran dry on song ideas somewhere just<br/>
&gt; after L20. Chains could have been a great song if it was _only_ a<br/>
&gt; targetted mob combat speed reducer. That way it wouldn&#39;t conflict with<br/>
&gt; snare and cause these headaches. Then he could have added another snare<br/>
&gt; song as a seperate song, for those occasions when you don&#39;t have a druid<br/>
&gt; or ranger. But no, GZ seems real big on these multiple action songs that<br/>
&gt; get resisted more and also conflict more with other class&#39;s spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Same with the magic resist debuffs. A straight debuff would have been<br/>
&gt; fine, but he had to add the dot which uses the same resist, so the songs<br/>
&gt; become effectively useless. Having magic, fire, and cold debuff songs<br/>
&gt; that tested on poison like tashan wouldn&#39;t have been that unbalancing or<br/>
&gt; intruding on the classes that get debuffs, considering how little they<br/>
&gt; debuff and the level the bard gets them at, but instead we got 3 songs<br/>
&gt; that no one ever uses.<br/>
