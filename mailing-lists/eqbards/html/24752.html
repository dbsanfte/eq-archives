<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915399604">1) Can it be sung?<br/>
<br/>
It cannot be sung.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) Does it push?<br/>
<br/>
No push.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) Does it have a damage component?<br/>
<br/>
No damage component. I actually use this song on mezed MOBs while the <br/>
tanks are taunting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4) Some numbers please?  Preferably with a hand drum, but I&#39;ll take <br/>
anything ;)  Ideally, with all the drums you have ;)<br/>
<br/>
*IF* I remember (I have been bad about this -- see the Lute of the <br/>
Howler discussions. *Grins*) I will hit myself with it and see what <br/>
it does.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While we are talking about this song, I have started using it in <br/>
another way. There have been a couple of times when I have *needed* <br/>
to keep a single MOB out of a fight (for example, the Hate 2 [some <br/>
MOBs can be mezed] and all the enchanters are dead.) Anyway, One <br/>
pulse of OoS followed by a couple pulses of SoT does a very nice job. <br/>
(Still cannot get spites in Hate 1. *Grins*)<br/>
