&gt;It is an extremely cheesy tactic. Similar tactics such as kiting are being<br/>
&gt;removed from the game. Root and nuke is not as cheesy becausae root wears<br/>
&gt;off unpredictably. Fear and snare or fear and darkness are also cheesy<br/>
&gt;tactics. There is nothing which defines these as an exploit but it is not a<br/>
&gt;respected tactic.<br/>

&gt; &gt; JC,<br/>
&gt; &gt; You wrote in your new bard guide:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some other useful bard songs include the chain(root) song and fear <br/>
&gt;songs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Chain is very useful to stop runners. Fear is generally not a useful<br/>
&gt;spell.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Many bards however employ a somewhat cheesy tactic where they will fear<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; monster then chain him over and over. This tactic will allow them to<br/>
&gt; &gt; constantly hit the monsters backside without being hit. It is sort of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; reverse kiting tactic. While it remains an effective tactic be warned <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; you probably won&#39;t make many friends if you employ it as a large amount <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; other players consider this cheesy or even an exploit.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tell me who is this an exploit? Is a Wizard Root/Nuking an exploit? Is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Necro Dot/Fearing with his pet beating on the fleeing monster an <br/>
&gt;exploit?<br/>
&gt; &gt; It is obvious you have never played a Bard to the level necessary to try<br/>
&gt; &gt; this tactic.  It is VERY dangerous to try this. Many white cons will<br/>
&gt;resist<br/>
&gt; &gt; fear far to much to use this tactic and in the high 20&#39;s these mobs are<br/>
&gt; &gt; hiting for 40 to 60 damage a pop. It is only effective against low to <br/>
&gt;mid<br/>
&gt; &gt; blues.  Sounds to me more like a case of class jealously then a true<br/>
&gt; &gt; analysis of what a Bard is capable of.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another false point in your &#39;guide&#39; is this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; However hide and sneak can be used together to give invisibility as well<br/>
&gt; &gt; though you will be moving at a very slow rate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is a rogue only skill, Bards do not get this ability.<br/>
