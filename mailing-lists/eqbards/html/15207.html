&gt; It is?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first jeweler I ever knew was a wizard. A cleric in our guild is<br/>
&gt; currently<br/>
&gt; also a Master in jewelrycraft. In fact, I know more enchanters that have<br/>
&gt; left jewelry than that are IN it. And quite a few non-enchanters that craft<br/>
&gt; and not only actively craft, but enjoy it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is one of the skills that got screwed up by the way<br/>
Verant implemented it.  INT affects your chance at skill<br/>
increases, so it&#39;s easiest for enchanters (and wizards, mages,<br/>
necros) to max their jewelcraft skill.  But WIS affects your<br/>
chance to succeed.  Couple that with the success rate for the<br/>
top end items being piss-poor even at 200 skill, and clerics<br/>
end up being the best jewelers.  If you became a jeweler with<br/>
the intent of making money on these high end items, and you<br/>
don&#39;t have near-200 WIS, there&#39;s just no way to financially<br/>
compete.<br/>
