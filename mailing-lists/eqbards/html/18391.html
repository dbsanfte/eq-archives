<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] ROK city <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-882827931">I have been ignoring most of the ROK posts here, sorry if this has been<br/>
covered recently.  (I didn&#39;t have and don&#39;t like most spoilers, at least<br/>
till I get frustrated)<br/>
<br/>
I went out and bought ROK from EB this weekend (only $20 after rebate!)<br/>
after I saw every player in my guild there.  (&quot;Come on over Elfson, we<br/>
want to PL you to 32&quot;  Its good being the only bard in the guild, you<br/>
get lots of attention).<br/>
<br/>
So a druid ported me to BB  for the boat ride (I wanted to learn how to<br/>
get there myself, so I wont have to count on tp&#39;s).  Naturally I got<br/>
bumped off the skiff (apparantly this is common since GM&#39;s don&#39;t even<br/>
ask questions they just gate you to FV if you petition).  While I was<br/>
waiting I hit  my new forage skill  cap at 55(I think its maxed) and got<br/>
27 points of swimming (I swam about 22,000 feet looking for a dock). <br/>
Eventually I was gated to FV.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of questions about the city (Firona Vie or whatever). <br/>
Is there a bank?  Is there a merchant who sells lower level bard songs? <br/>
I found the guy who sells the 51+ songs (any reason they are cheaper<br/>
than my lvl 25+ songs?).  I saw the bard trainer thread, and saw no<br/>
replies, so I&#39;ll assume thats a no (Eh, who cares about hide and safe<br/>
fall?).  <br/>
<br/>
Well so far its an intersting place.  I can&#39;t believe how big the agro<br/>
radius on most of these things, but I can run fast :)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
