<div id="ygrps-yiv-929413948">Nah, I&#39;d never heal IN battle.  I&#39;m finding I don&#39;t have time to clarity in<br/>
battle either!  But, in between battles, I&#39;d rather weave Clarity and Hymn<br/>
to get us back to full health instead of asking the healers to spend that<br/>
mana I&#39;m so busily working on getting back for them.<br/>
<br/>
In battle, I still find Lullaby to be useful.  Granted, it works like crap<br/>
compared to an enchanter&#39;s mez, but I&#39;m finding that it does take at least<br/>
50% of the MOBs out of the battle... especially the ones that con lower blue<br/>
to me.  I do not play it when we have Solusek Gobs though, since they seem<br/>
to be completely uneffected by it AND it pisses them off :-P.  Lullaby also<br/>
seems to do a good job of interupting casters when we pull those 2 Inferno<br/>
Wizards... even if it doesn&#39;t reliably sleep them.  I actually use it when<br/>
we pull Sol Mages now also.  It&#39;s a lot easier to start it up and forget<br/>
about it then watching for the glazes over message and stopping and<br/>
restarting the song.  I only use Pixie when I want to take a single MOB all<br/>
the way out of the battle or space the spawns apart.  And as one more<br/>
benificial side effect of lullaby is they attack me instead of the greater<br/>
healers and as long as I have a dedicated greater healer (I seem to piss the<br/>
mobs off much more then any greater healer does), I&#39;m going to leave Lullaby<br/>
in my song selection.  I have more hit points and without a MOB beating on<br/>
them, they can actually cast :-).  Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t leave room<br/>
for a Psalm in my play list..<br/>
<br/>
So, out of battle, Clarity and Hymn, in battle, Lullaby, Pixie, occasional<br/>
chains and Clarity if I get the chance...<br/>
<br/>
Lament for pulling, Levitate for emergencies (someone ALWAYS falls into the<br/>
Lava... especially fighting CWG&#39;s and EXG&#39;s), and Screech for when we need<br/>
an Evac (although I&#39;m finding Lullaby is a good Evac song also... especially<br/>
when running to zone).<br/>
<br/>
Taneran, also opinionated but willing to try new things ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; the number), healing (I weave it with Clarity), chains (I can get it to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   ACK!  Healing, yuk yuk.  That&#39;s a big no-no.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Playing Hymm in battle at your level is like hanging a sign<br/>
&gt;   on your back that says, Please Kill Me.  You are more likely to<br/>
&gt;   receive blows in the 30s and 40s at your level.  Healing back<br/>
&gt;   12-14 points of health each round just doesnt keep up.  Let your<br/>
&gt;   healer do his job, and supply him with the mana to do it, while<br/>
&gt;   twisting in anthem or resist/dmg shield.  At level 36, Celerity<br/>
&gt;   song will make you want to twist in atkspeed again.  Anthem since<br/>
&gt;   L10 gets really, really old by L36.  But you&#39;ll love Verses of<br/>
&gt;   Celerity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I tested Lullaby last night on four Gnoll Reavers (L14-ish)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I got no resists (as I shouldnt have).  All nod messages, and<br/>
&gt;   hardly any of those bastards stayed asleep.  They wailed on<br/>
&gt;   me the whole time.  It was if I wasn&#39;t even playing the song.<br/>
&gt;   If lullaby is this broken, I would resort to pixie/charm.<br/>
&gt;   Although that can be a full time job, if you let it be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic, opinionated ;)<br/>
