<div id="ygrps-yiv-762854093">Hmmmm... I wonder what level range &quot;Paineel&quot; and &quot;the Hole&quot; are going to be<br/>
targetted for.  I have been to Erudin once in my whole career (to buys<br/>
songs).  When I was there, I never saw another single person.  As it stands,<br/>
that island doesn&#39;t have a whole heckuva lot to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning Feign Death... You know Verant never thought that it would become<br/>
one of the best &quot;pulling&quot; methods around.  It sucks they had to nerf it, but<br/>
I can understand where they&#39;re coming from.<br/>

&gt; He should be as safe as ever in Q Hills.  I travel thru there <br/>
&gt; regularly and<br/>
&gt; was there last nite as well, no sign of unusual mobs.  Unlike <br/>
&gt; Kithicor Q<br/>
&gt; Hills appears to have been a singular event.  What concerns <br/>
&gt; me more is the<br/>
&gt; change to Paw and the trend you mentioned.  While its great <br/>
&gt; for high level<br/>
&gt; characters, what are the people who aren&#39;t high level <br/>
&gt; supposed to do?  My<br/>
&gt; guild has a whole group of six on its way to Paw now as its <br/>
&gt; one of the few<br/>
&gt; uncrowded places perfect for their levels.  If they really <br/>
&gt; want upgrade a<br/>
&gt; zone how about Kerra Isle?  It would be a month before word <br/>
&gt; would even get<br/>
&gt; out most likely.<br/>
