<div id="ygrps-yiv-275206613">so, you say because I am level 22, you have played everquest as a bard<br/>
longer than I have? Perhaps you have, but that does not mean you are<br/>
special. For your information, I have played Martyn as a bard since Day one,<br/>
And even phase 3 beta. If you have played longer than that, good for you.<br/>
(applauds)<br/>
My works schedule fluxuates, not to mention I am in no race to make level<br/>
50. which explains my level 22 self. I esplore, I goof around. I sing songs<br/>
in concert. I roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
Being level 40 whatever doesnt make you better than me.<br/>
nor anyone else.<br/>
that is the tone I objected to.<br/>
<br/>
And a level 22 bard is wearing bronze Breasplate, bronze bracers, bronze<br/>
boots. blackened iron arms, and legs. and some bit of leather.<br/>
I was in leather until level 16, when I replaced it with some expensive<br/>
bronze. and then the BI, when I visited runnyeye<br/>
<br/>
Like I said. I am not a twink. The only thing I have ever been given is a<br/>
barbed whip and some advice.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some advice of mine.<br/>
<br/>
be more respectful to others. jt because you are anonymouse on the net<br/>
doesnt give you the right to treat others like dirt<br/>

&gt; I did not like your tone, sir. you assume that I am a low level -twink-<br/>
&gt; well, sorry to say, mister know it all, that I am a level 22 bard, and<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; is my ONLY damn character. for you to go say &quot;Well, you don&#39;t -deserve- it<br/>
&gt; then&quot; is typical elitist attitude that is starting to drive me away from<br/>
&gt; this game. What gives you the right to judge me?<br/>
<br/>
  ((I hate to be the one to say this... but you don&#39;t deserve it then.))<br/>
<br/>
  My comment stands.  However, I apologize for the seemingly lack of<br/>
  respect, but you&#39;ve got to realize I&#39;ve played this game<br/>
  as a bard longer than you have -- and I hear all the L20 bards<br/>
  complaining because the Lambent quests are too hard.  The fact<br/>
  that they think they should get Lambent because they are something<br/>
  special, irritates me.  I worked really hard for my armor.<br/>
<br/>
  My point was I wish all bards had to work for their armor, cause<br/>
  it doesn&#39;t get any better until level 46.  I dont whine that I<br/>
  cannot get the Plane armor yet, so I&#39;m working as hard as I<br/>
  can to become of level to travel and earn it.<br/>
<br/>
  Plus, I never called you a twink.  You put those words in my mouth<br/>
  Mr. Level 22 Bard hehe.  So what does a L22 bard wear nowadays?<br/>
<br/>
  You posted to this list looking for advice, and I gave it to you.<br/>
  I&#39;m sorry it wasn&#39;t what you wanted to hear.  If you want Lambent<br/>
  armor, you need to take some risks and quest for it, or pay the<br/>
  piper.  I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.<br/>
