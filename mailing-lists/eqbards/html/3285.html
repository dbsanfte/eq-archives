speed.  Over a one minute battle, the DD will only attack 5<br/>
more times than a BLW if wielded in the primary.  If wielded<br/>
in the secondary and a 20% chance to dual wield (roughly L20),<br/>
the DD would only attack one more time than the BLW on average<br/>
over a minute.  It&#39;d be easy to fail to notice that<br/>
difference.<br/>

If you want to really test it, try a DD vs a minotaur axe.<br/>
