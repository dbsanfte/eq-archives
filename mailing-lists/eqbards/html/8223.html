<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401426624">I was specifically told by a GM on E&#39;ci to /petition names that were<br/>
inappropriate and that if I encountered a repeatable and visible bug to also<br/>
/petition it so a GM could see and verify it.  Whether this is standard<br/>
procedure in all cases i do not know, but this GM at least wanted to be able<br/>
to firsthand tell the dev team how he observed the bug so it would not be<br/>
misunderstood.<br/>

I agree with you that there was quite the bit of<br/>
over reaction in his response, but at the root of<br/>
his response was the truth. Petitioning because <br/>
of a problem with an item&#39;s stats or because you<br/>
don&#39;t like the way something works in Norrath is<br/>
about as useful as writing it on a post-it note<br/>
and putting it on your monitor. Guides/GM&#39;s have<br/>
absolutely NO influence on or to the Verant<br/>
developers. (Plainly states as much in the &#39;guide<br/>
book&#39; that was &quot;leaked&quot; not too long ago)<br/>
<br/>
So in effect, if everyone /petition&#39;d with things<br/>
such as this, the &quot;stuck in the bottom of the world&quot;<br/>
type petitioners would have to wait that much longer<br/>
while the complainers are repeatedly told that<br/>
they should do a /feedback report. Also, if you&#39;ve<br/>
read that book that I mentioned above, you&#39;ll see<br/>
where the only thing the guide is going to do is<br/>
log the petition as feedback just as the user<br/>
should have done in the first place to save time. It<br/>
makes absolutely no mention of any &#39;database&#39; that<br/>
the guides keep so I&#39;d be confident in saying that<br/>
one probably doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>

&gt; pettions stuff, the stats on the items aren&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; known yet.  Perhaps some prozac is in order<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; /petition You all messed up again, you gave me<br/>
&gt; cleric type armor, what gives?  Don&#39;t you realize<br/>
&gt; bards primary stats are in STR/DEX/AGI/CHA?  You<br/>
&gt; probably just typo&#39;d in the armor database again<br/>
