end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>
got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>
off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>
from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>
thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>
Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>
speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>
with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>
<br/>
The thing that really irks me about this is that it&#39;s a client<br/>
side problem.  The determination that &quot;you haven&#39;t yet<br/>
recovered&quot; to sing another song is completely client side, and<br/>
completely dependent on the speed of your system.  When I had<br/>
a P200 with a Voodoo 1, it took ages for the song buttons to<br/>
un-grey when I stopped singing.  When I upgraded to my current<br/>
system, it was almost instant, except as noted above when lots<br/>
of spells are flying.  I would prefer to be able to turn off<br/>
the button un-grey animation sequence and suffer a flat time<br/>
delay which doesn&#39;t change with CPU speed.<br/>
