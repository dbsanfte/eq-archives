<br/>
Can you get to level 50 without twisting? You can get there without playing<br/>
any songs. But parties are going to question what good you are. Why does any<br/>
hunting party need a bard? Really... they don&#39;t. So you need to really<br/>
impress people ya don&#39;t know. God I had to get a full suit of bronze so I<br/>
could get into parties at level 20 because of all the damn twinks.<br/>
<br/>
And twisting is not an exploit, but rather a &quot;feature&quot; of our class. We are<br/>
balanced with twisting in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Will one song be good enough? Sure, and your party will boot you out when<br/>
the first tank comes along because you are doing 20 points of damage a<br/>
round, constantly frenzying the mobs, and don&#39;t add anything to the party as<br/>
a whole.</div>
