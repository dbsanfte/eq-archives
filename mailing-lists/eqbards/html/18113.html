<br/>
&quot;This item can be obtained via the Test of Pitch in Plane of Air.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No further mention of what it does - looking at eq casters next... hmm nothing there yet.  Wonder if it enhances levitation or Melifious Motion (flute of flight?). Or has charges of gate (heh - nah they would show on the item view.)<br/>

Songweaver&#39;s Mantle<br/>
magic lore no drop<br/>
ac 9 dex +7 agi +5 cha +5 wt 2.5 <br/>
effect: Fury<br/>
Bard All<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This item can be obtained via the Test of Voice in Plane of Air. The effect grants strength, armor class and hit points.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am one item away from this one.  All I need is the light woolen mantle - rumored to drop off one of the I-3 bosses.  Now this looks like a really decent item.<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to the FoH folks who did whatever they did to get these things.  <br/>
