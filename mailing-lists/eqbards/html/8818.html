<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104833208">Congrats on your victory! It sounds like you also benefited from a favorable<br/>
zone time once or twice, though not enough to give you a huge advantage. I<br/>
didn&#39;t realize Shamans got SoC that soon. Now I&#39;ll have to watch what I say<br/>
to my Shaman friend when I pass him by during the next few levels. It may<br/>
come back to haunt me! Just have to aquire a MM Battledrum and have it handy<br/>
the first time he asks to race. : )<br/>

&gt; Just thought you might like to know. My guild &lt;Fervir&gt; had an event vs.<br/>
&gt; &lt;Nox Aeris&gt; today on the Innoruk Server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically the two guilds went to war and then we chose a person to race<br/>
&gt; from the Arena in Lake Rathe to West Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got nominated, 22nd Level Bard(go figure), and Nox Aeris put up a 24th<br/>
&gt; level Shaman. (little did i know 24 is the level where you get Spirit of<br/>
&gt; Cheetah)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So we take off, and it is a tie at the Rathe Mountain zone. Both our<br/>
&gt; guilds have ambushes set up along the way (i planned to twist Rhythyms<br/>
&gt; when i got in trouble to up my magic resist). Then the Shaman pulls<br/>
&gt; ahead of me for a second... but then he has to stop and cast SoC again<br/>
&gt; (i have heard it lasts 30 seconds). I catch up to him, and pass him,<br/>
&gt; then he passes me again... then has to stop to cast again... and i pass<br/>
&gt; him and never see him again. i got a report at South Ro, that he was<br/>
&gt; right behind me (that was where our ambush was set. Both sets of<br/>
&gt; ambushers (ours and theirs) said &quot;i saw him for a second, but could not<br/>
&gt; target him, much less cast a spell&quot;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the time I entered West freeport, the shaman had just zoned into into<br/>
&gt; East commons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So my guild won, thanks to the bard speed. It was quite a shock to the<br/>
&gt; other guild since I strutted around like a warrior with my PGT and BLW<br/>
&gt; all morning, just for their benefit, only breaking out my drum and song<br/>
&gt; when they said &quot;GO&quot;.<br/>
