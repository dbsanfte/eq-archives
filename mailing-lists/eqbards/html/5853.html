&gt; Supposedly, in an upcoming patch, the zone you are in will have an impact<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; what item you can forage.  This was brought up on the EQBrewers list in<br/>
&gt; reference to morning dew, which is a component of elven wine.  Verant has<br/>
&gt; stated its in the game but no one has been able to find it.  Assuming this<br/>
&gt; is true, you would expect to find morning dew in Greater/Lesser Faydark.<br/>
&gt; Guess we will have to wait and see what happens.<br/>
