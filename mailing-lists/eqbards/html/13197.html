<div id="ygrps-yiv-371296385">Actually, instead of parry I would love to see bards get riposte.  Not a<br/>
woefully overpowering request considering how poor our offensive and<br/>
defensive cap out.  That would more differentiate us from the plain vanilla<br/>
melee skills we get (duel/dodge), and besides, even if we got it, ya know<br/>
they would cap it low. ;)  Parry is too common place!<br/>
<br/>
As for binding issues - most of your agony goes away when you get a 29th+<br/>
cleric in the group, which incidentally happens about the time running back<br/>
becomes... inconvenient at best - this coming from someone who has more than<br/>
once awoke from his cazic dirt nap in Halas or Kelethin. :)<br/>

PS: I read on here someone petitioned about hell levels, asking if it was a<br/>
bug, etc.  I found it enormously funny that I had done the same.  I was<br/>
quite shocked to get a non-visible admin tell me &quot;I&#39;m really sorry, but its<br/>
a shortsighted attempt by Verant to slow leveling.  Its not a bug, its just<br/>
poor design.&quot;  And for once, I agreed with a GM.</div>
