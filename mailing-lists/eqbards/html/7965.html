<div id="ygrps-yiv-756160049">Heh maybe but could you start a level 1 character and waste a lot more hours<br/>
early on scourging for money for this spell or this piece of armor? That&#39;s<br/>
the problem I have once you hit 16 or 17 + the lower levels are so boring<br/>
that it&#39;s hard to go back. That&#39;s really the only reason I twink plus it&#39;s<br/>
kind of fun somehow.<br/>

&gt;This twinking argument could continue forever.  You&#39;re arguing personal<br/>
&gt;opinion and nothing more.  In my experience, it&#39;s difficult, if not<br/>
&gt;impossible, to change someone&#39;s attitude towards something.  That is<br/>
&gt;something they have to do themselves.  If you don&#39;t mind twinking - twink.<br/>
&gt;If you do mind twinking - don&#39;t twink (and don&#39;t support twinkers and<br/>
&gt;twinkees).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hope no one takes offense to this, &#39;cause it&#39;s not intended to be<br/>
&gt;offensive.  I&#39;m definitely not saying one way is correct and the other is<br/>
&gt;wrong.  That is for you to decide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, in my ** PERSONAL OPINION **, twinking does detract from the game,<br/>
&gt;in the fact that it strips the character of having to strive for better<br/>
&gt;equipment... and half the fun of these games is obtaining new toys and<br/>
&gt;watching your character move up through the ranks.<br/>

&gt;But are you really making their life easier by twinking them?  Are you<br/>
&gt;really enhancing the playing experience?  I know a Druid, who was givin the<br/>
&gt;following equipment before they reached 2nd level: Full Leather Armor, many<br/>
&gt;snakeskin pieces including tunic, Bloodforge hammer, 2 cutthroat rings, at<br/>
&gt;least 50 plat.  Now whats next for her?  When she thinks about the &quot;next<br/>
&gt;cool item&quot; she wants to get her hands on.  She is thinking about items that<br/>
&gt;are WAY over her head.  She is now 13th level, and she still hasent out<br/>
&gt;grown any of her equipment.  And now after 13 levels she is realizing that<br/>
&gt;it is very difficult to get stuff.  13 levels and she haddent gained the<br/>
&gt;respect for items that you get over time.  It is sad.  She is bored, and<br/>
&gt;feeling useless.  Actually I have talked her into creating a bard :) and<br/>

&gt;Ok Im not talking about giving a tarnished weapon to a 1st level char.  No<br/>
&gt;Im talking about giving someone somthing that they will be stuck with for a<br/>
&gt;very very long time.  Change is good.  And on top of this.  My poor Druid<br/>
&gt;friend, has been using a 2 handed blunt bloodforge for 13 levels, never<br/>
&gt;switching weapons.  Now she is stuck, and worried about switching to a<br/>
&gt;weapon she has never used.  Wow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I dont get it.  Perhaps im a little jaded because I have been looking for a<br/>
&gt;Bronze Breastplate for the last 2 weeks with no luck.. But I dont think its<br/>
&gt;all that.<br/>

&gt;&gt; not have friends who offer.  But I always turn it down.  If you twink a<br/>

&gt; But getting items is not as glorious and fun as you make it out to<br/>
&gt;be, at least, not very often.  The message boards are filled with rants of<br/>
&gt;&quot;I went to so and so dungeon, and right before I killed this monster, some<br/>
&gt;level 40 invisible magician ran by us and stole my kill&quot;.  Do you really<br/>
&gt;want your second character, or your friends, to go through the same system<br/>
&gt;of camping hours on end and dealing with kill stealers that you did?<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s something ingrained in human nature to try and make the lives<br/>
&gt;of our family and friends easier, to save them the hardships that we had<br/>
&gt;to go through.  To me, the &quot;fun&quot; in everquest is the interaction between<br/>
&gt;you and your friends, going in a group to kill monsters to learn new<br/>
&gt;skills and new spells.  Going through a dungeon to get items is nice and<br/>
&gt;all, but when the items in question are ones in which you have to deal<br/>
&gt;with people who&#39;s sole purpose seem to deprive other people of their fun,<br/>
&gt;by farming the items for ebay, or kill stealing them items for themselves,<br/>
&gt;I for one wouldn&#39;t want to go through that experience any more than I have<br/>
&gt;to, nor would I want to put anyone else through it.<br/>
