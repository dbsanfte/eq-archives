<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994841613">At 25th level, I was able to get the shin greaves and shin gauntlets over<br/>
the weekend.  Because I have never killed a froglok, I can safely travel<br/>
through Upper Guk.  Invis song should get you safely through also.  I<br/>
stocked up on food and water and went to Lower Guk.  At the zone border, I<br/>
offered to give people food and water if they needed it (Thanks for the idea<br/>
Kitasi).  Also temporarily joined with groups when they needed to heal after<br/>
combat.  Last but not least I provided ATM services by giving them PP in<br/>
exchange for other coins.  I let everyone know I was trying to acquire the<br/>
shin greaves and gauntlets.  Everyone who was fighting in Lower Guk at the<br/>
time either already had the greaves and gauntlets, had better armor already,<br/>
or couldn&#39;t use them.   Someone let me loot the gauntlets for singing the<br/>
healing song for them.  I teamed up with a 35 rogue and got the greaves with<br/>
his assistance.  The mobs that drop the gauntlets and greaves spawn near the<br/>
zone border so you can hang around there until the armor gets dropped.    <br/>
<br/>
Had a good chance of getting the icy greaves in Permafrost but they never<br/>
got dropped while I was there.  A group fighting in the King Pit didn&#39;t need<br/>
them and was going to let me loot them but they had to camp before the armor<br/>
was dropped.  A bard with Invis Song can safely get to the King Pit if they<br/>
want to try getting the icy greaves in this manner.<br/>
<br/>
I would imagine that within the next week or so, bard quest components items<br/>
will start getting destroyed by groups unless a needy bard is nearby. Its<br/>
already starting to happen on E&#39;ci.  In this particular case, making these<br/>
items NO DROP is very beneficial to bards not high enough to get the items<br/>
by killing the mob themselves.  <br/>

&gt; to buying it - not enough cash anyway) - but of course with help (not<br/>
&gt; solo).  What level does one need to be before thinking about starting to<br/>
&gt; get this stuff?<br/>
