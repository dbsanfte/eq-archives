<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034112403">I have foraged several backpacks full of berries, etc for baking and have<br/>
never gotten a single special forage.  I have probably successfully foraged<br/>
at least 200 items since they were added with no luck.  My friend who is a<br/>
level 15 ranger has gotten 2 so far with a forage of 75+.<br/>

I believe there is a skill-check involved in foraging the new special food<br/>
(like crocodile eggs, mushrooms, sea salt, sylvian berries, glowing lich,<br/>
etc), but I&#39;m trying to figure out what it is.<br/>
<br/>
So I have a few questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. Bards max at 40 foraging, right?<br/>
2. At what level do you usually reach 40 skill foraging?<br/>
3. Have any of you bards managed to forage something other than berries,<br/>
fruit, rabbit meat, roots, veggies and water? And at what skill level did<br/>
you get it?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know about druids? (Like, if you have a druid, what is his skill cap<br/>
and has he found any of the items, etc)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
