<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152998610">I just dinged 53 Friday night.  I scribed SoT and started using it and WOW!<br/>
It┬Æs amazing.  I┬Æve used it in the Karnor Dog Tower, against Raptors and<br/>
Vicious Raptors in Timorous Deep and at the zone in Chardok.<br/>
<br/>
This song really changes things for me. I feel like I did at 32 ┬û getting a<br/>
new song that really increased my capability and group-ability.  Unlike<br/>
others ┬û I┬Æve found Pixie to be too resistant to be usable.  Keeping 2 mobs<br/>
parked now is trivial.  The resists were rare ┬û me or anyone else getting<br/>
hit was even rarer.  I don┬Æt have to worry about post-rez mana shortage for<br/>
crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
I had a group with 2 Druids, 2 Paladins and myself at the zone out in<br/>
Chardok.  We had little difficulty.  We had a 59 monk soloing ┬û he was<br/>
┬ôPersonality Challenged┬ö and through a fit because we complained about him<br/>
training us by pulling through us because he was there first.  He got mad<br/>
because his pull through us started hitting my group so I mezzed it &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was a large guild raiding there ┬û and went bad after they tried to<br/>
take the Queen down.  A good buddy 56 Shaman hung out with us while he<br/>
waited on his CR ┬û and initially thought we were ┬ôCrazy┬ö to fight there<br/>
without a Cleric.  He through us some nice buffs and slowed the mobs for us<br/>
while he waited ┬û which rocked ┬û but we kicked butt before and after.  This<br/>
was with a five man group.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually a third Druid came and one of the Pallies had to leave.  Shortly<br/>
thereafter ┬û we had a 2 pull and a third wandered in.  I was able to keep<br/>
the two parked indefinitely without any problems.  But the mob left (forget<br/>
which type of Sarnak it was) was a Cleric or Shaman ┬û and dotted the tank<br/>
and healed itself.  Ironically ┬û we were able to keep the extras down ┬û but<br/>
couldn┬Æt kill the single one fast enough with only the one tank.  (Druid DOT<br/>
┬Æs were resisted etc)<br/>
