<div id="ygrps-yiv-636484051">Um. I have to F10 to put the backpack slot into my hotkey slots.<br/>
(or any hotkey) But not to open the backpack.<br/>
<br/>
I play in full screen all the time, and fish with a backpack there, etc.<br/>
And have had no problems opening it.<br/>

&gt;Make sure that you are not playing a song - then open your inventory screen<br/>
&gt;and right click it.  I think that you could put the inv slot onto a hot key<br/>
&gt;pad but then you may need to be in the F10 view for it to work<br/>
&gt;(not sure but<br/>
&gt;I know you have to F10 to open backpacks and such when they are hot keyed)<br/>
&gt;Most likely, you just need to stop song then right cilick.  I doubt they<br/>
&gt;have a level cap above 44 on the item.<br/>
