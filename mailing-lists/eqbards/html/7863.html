<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274043045">Twink, I say! Well... in moderation anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I am but a bellowing bard (12th song) who still marvels at the wonders of<br/>
Norrath upon entering a zone for the first time. (Last night was Oasis and S<br/>
Ro.). I have never asked anyone for anything and prefer the satisfaction<br/>
that comes from watching the pp&#39;s inch slowly upward in the bank as I return<br/>
from a glorious hunt. Grouping is a joy, and the social interaction of the<br/>
Bard is unmatched among classes.<br/>
<br/>
On one fateful night, my 9th song, fully leathered, non-twinked mino axe<br/>
wielding self answered a tell in the bank for a Bracer of Erollisi (sp?). I<br/>
had 7pp to my name (saved for my next song) but wanted the item and talked<br/>
the seller down to 5pp. We completed the transaction and I was ready to<br/>
depart when the seller asked if I would do him a favor. It turns out he was<br/>
a high (to me) level druid and wanted to trade some equipment with another<br/>
character of his. I agreed, not considering cross-character transfers to be<br/>
twinking. Several items passed through my inventory, and I caught a glimpse<br/>
of wonders I knew I would not see for many many game years. I was happy to<br/>
help and he was happy to reward me for my time (about a half hour investment<br/>
for which I expected nothing). He gave me a bronze BP, helm, boots, and<br/>
misc. other items (no cash). I confess that I felt a twinge of indecision,<br/>
then happily accepted the items. Since then I have had no regrets.<br/>
<br/>
I do not ask for anything, nor do I expect anything when I help people. But<br/>
I am grateful for the generosity I have experienced and will happily pass on<br/>
my items to another when the time comes. The game has been rewarding for me<br/>
as much for the random acts of kindness as anything else.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; In theory, I agree with you.  Tell me about your wonderful adventure<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; a Polish Garnet Tommychopper. Why do I think the story would go something<br/>
&gt; like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We spent four cold rainy Norrath days and nights in the Highhold Pass.<br/>
&gt; Many foul gnolls fell to our blades.  We dealt with shamans, brawlers and<br/>
&gt; champions.  Some fights were so close we praised the gods that we<br/>
survived!<br/>
&gt; And then thru the mist, he appeared - the head muckity-muck of the<br/>
MuckTail<br/>
&gt; Clan - Granix Mucktail himself!  We took a deep breath, we drew our<br/>
swords,<br/>
&gt; we said our prayers and then.........<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cecille begins to cast a spell...<br/>
&gt; Toronto begins to cast a spell...<br/>
&gt; Talishar begins to cast a spell...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And when the particles cleared the air...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cecille auctions PGT bids start at 250pp!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (For those of you who don&#39;t play on Innoruuk server, the names have NOT<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; changed to protect the guilty Ks&#39;ers.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would be an entirely different game if......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. There was no camping/farming (lots of good ways to fix this - don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really matter how)<br/>
&gt; 2. There were no Kill Stealing (again good ways to fix and perhaps we<br/>
&gt; are actually gonna see some implemented.)<br/>
&gt; 3. There was no internet (ie: spolier sites and instant flow of<br/>
&gt; information)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Ok, so this is Guk - where do we go from here?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Who&#39;s got the maps?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Lemme log quick and grab one&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Nm, I&#39;ll print one off me laptop - one sec&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But that&#39;s not the way it is so we end up with a player driven economy.<br/>
My<br/>
&gt; group has lots of money and we buy the stuff we want/need and simply avoid<br/>
&gt; the ks&#39;ing campers.  We did have one really lucky night in the Tae room in<br/>
&gt; Cazic and got some rubi panties.  The next night was KS-Hell and we have<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; been back.  Stoopid Kyle, does he really think that we don&#39;t have see<br/>
invis?<br/>
&gt; So the moron sits by the throne.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Right now - its damn near impossible to get the stuff you want the old<br/>
&gt; fashion way so you end up buying it and hunting other places for xp.<br/>
Let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; see some gators drop some rubi - mebbe they ate some one who was wearing<br/>
&gt; some!  I know they ate me and my steel plate!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also have great armor is only marginally better that having &quot;average&quot;<br/>
&gt; armors.  It looks a whole lot better!  But the real &quot;twink&quot; for power is<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; stat jewelry, stat items, and uber-weapons.  Those things will make a<br/>
decent<br/>
&gt; difference in your performance.  Armor is just the most visible twink.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night, our group spent 4 hours in Unrest and we got virtually a full<br/>
&gt; set of small bronze - pretty good night.  So, what is the &quot;right&quot; thing to<br/>
&gt; do with it?  Sell it to the local young warriors and endure another 2<br/>
hours<br/>
&gt; of hard luck tales and haggling over 2pp here and 4pp there?  Or would it<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; ok with you if I started a gnome warrior and gave it to him when his<br/>
corpse<br/>
&gt; stopped decaying in 15 minutes?  Or would it be ok with you if I just gave<br/>
&gt; it to the next cute little wood elf who might look even cuter in all<br/>
bronze<br/>
&gt; while I am waiting for the wiz to break camp and port us back to<br/>
&gt; civilization?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Put a little magic happiness in some ones life - twink them!~<br/>

&gt; My Bard, has never ever been given a single item or money!<br/>
&gt; Not that I do<br/>
&gt; not have friends who offer.  But I always turn it down.  If<br/>
&gt; you twink a<br/>
&gt; character, you are giving them something, but you are also<br/>
&gt; taking something<br/>
&gt; even more valuable away from them.  The wonderfull<br/>
&gt; experience of leveling on<br/>
&gt; their own.<br/>
