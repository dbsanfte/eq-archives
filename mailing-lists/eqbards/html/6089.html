<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001569253">I would get HTH increases all the time with intruments equiped.  Besure you <br/>
are fighting non-greens (as the chance of getting a skill increase against <br/>
greens is very, very small).  Also in my experience HTH raise very slowly.  <br/>
Mine is currently in 90&#39;s<br/>

&gt;The other night a crazy Barbarian friend of mine suggests we try working on<br/>
&gt;our hand-to-hand skills against the reavers.  Sure, I say, let me learn<br/>
&gt;a few appropriate songs (Chords, etc) and I&#39;ll equip the Lute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We do pretty well at reavers, but I notice my hand-to-hand skill never <br/>
&gt;moves.<br/>
&gt;Eventually we get into a bad situation (or more correctly, a bad situation<br/>
&gt;is delivered to us by another player) and I switch over to Longsword and <br/>
&gt;Dirk.<br/>
&gt;Immediatly I start getting skill-ups in Offense, Dual Wield, etc (I had <br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt;recently made 19th and spent the session before making the cross-country <br/>
&gt;run<br/>
&gt;to get Clouding).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So it seems that you don&#39;t get any chance to increase your skills (hand-to-<br/>
&gt;hand or any other offensive skills) when using the Lute.  As far as I could<br/>
&gt;tell, you don&#39;t increase in Dodge or Defense either...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After realizing that I switched over to pure hand-to-hand, thinking that <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Lute was the problem.  I still didn&#39;t notice any skill-ups, but I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;fight very long this way before giving up (without the Lute it was hard to<br/>
&gt;take down the reavers).  Perhaps I didn&#39;t see any skill-ups because my <br/>
&gt;hand-<br/>
&gt;to-hand skill is pathetically low to begin with?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone with more experience in the support-bard role have any tips for a<br/>
&gt;battle-bard?  I was pretty impressed at how effective I am at higher levels<br/>
&gt;with just songs...<br/>
