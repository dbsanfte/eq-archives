Initially deceptive, had to read the intro 3 times before I figured it<br/>
out...subtlety is an extraordinary literary talent.<br/>

I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have kids yet, even though I&#39;m sure I&#39;d love them all the<br/>
same if it were not so.<br/>

&gt; I was getting ready to play EQ last night right<br/>
&gt; after dinner and thought I would post the results<br/>
&gt; of my Lullaby testing after the latest patch.<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the scenario.  I encountered a 2nd (nearly<br/>
&gt; 3rd) level young human named Duncan in his lair.<br/>
&gt; He is the common spawn in the &quot;child&#39;s bedroom&quot; of<br/>
&gt; the Estate of Klug. Not wanting to ruin my Wife of<br/>
&gt; Klug faction, I decided I&#39;d use Lullaby to nod the<br/>
&gt; mob, so that I could run away and continue<br/>
&gt; adventuring.  Now keep in mind that I&#39;m 31st<br/>
&gt; level, which is WELL beyond the level where I<br/>
&gt; should have any problems with Lullaby functioning<br/>
&gt; at peak efficiency.  Well, my first attempt was<br/>
&gt; resisted entirely...the mob continued to attack<br/>
&gt; me, saying, &quot;You will not escape me so easily,<br/>
&gt; Daddy00!  More stories!!!&quot;  My second attempt<br/>
&gt; appeared to work, but just as I was running away<br/>
&gt; (down the stairs) the mob woke up and began<br/>
&gt; attacking me again, &quot;Daddy00, I&#39;m scared of the<br/>
&gt; fire alarm!&quot;  Again, I fired up Lullaby.  Again,<br/>
&gt; the mob appeared to nod off, and I actually almost<br/>
&gt; made it to the zone, when it woke up again.  I ran<br/>
&gt; back up the stairs to avoid aggroing anything<br/>
&gt; else, and Lullabied again.  Only this final one<br/>
&gt; stuck.  Now that&#39;s only one out of four attempts,<br/>
&gt; for an overal resist rate of 75%!  I think this is<br/>
&gt; intolerable, and I may have to stop playing EQ if<br/>
&gt; Verant doesn&#39;t fix this obvious nerf.<br/>
