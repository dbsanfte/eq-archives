<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392391005">I been fighting down on the chicken ranch and the merch birtie there hates<br/>
me for some reason.  My Order of Thunder dont help nor does the Charillion<br/>
song. Nor does stand in front nor in back nor using sneak.  i might try the<br/>
invis song but i am loath to climb up there again because everytime I<br/>
have -- I end up falling off!<br/>
<br/>
I get told something about half-elfs and she dont sell to me.  I did kill a<br/>
few - and i mean only like 2 or 3 aviaks in Lake Rathe - which hits your<br/>
Aviak faction.  You can kill all the Aviak Guards you want - but dont kill<br/>
the baby birties.  In SK, you can kill all the chickens you want and they<br/>
still sell to you (well not me but others - non-hummies I guess.)  But i<br/>
think eventually they do scowl at you.  My high lev fiends who are killing<br/>
avocets now said they went KOS.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone ever try the Charillion on the ice giants up in Perma?<br/>

&gt;Just a side-note about Carillon.<br/>
&gt;I was in Felwithe in the armory window-shopping and tried Carillon on the<br/>
&gt;high-elf female npc shopkeepers that stand behind the counter (in the shop<br/>
&gt;next to the bank). I noticed their faction was still apprehensive to me (i<br/>
&gt;am half-elf Quellious follower - guess they don&#39;t like that much =).  I<br/>
&gt;figured it just wasn&#39;t working...<br/>
&gt;Then, I walked AROUND the counter to stand directly in front of the npc and<br/>
&gt;tried again and they became Amiable!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This also happened with the armor merchant in East Freeport - he was<br/>
&gt;indifferent even with Carillon until i walked AROUND the his counter and<br/>
&gt;stood in front of him. Amiable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just thought I would share this.<br/>
