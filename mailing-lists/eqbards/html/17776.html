<div id="ygrps-yiv-685898043">Don&#39;t *ASK* if you can leave the chessboard.  Program<br/>
a social to the referee so you send him/her a tell and<br/>
they know you aren&#39;t leaving the zone.  I say a button<br/>
because you may be busy as you run...<br/>
<br/>
It is easier to ask forgiveness than to get<br/>
permission ... especially when playing a widely <br/>
misunderstood class;-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah...this magican starts the duel WITHOUT the pet<br/>
and summon after the fight begins...pretty much the<br/>
convention but your opponent may try to argue<br/>
otherwise.  Pets are somewhat variable in level and<br/>
you don&#39;t want him showing up with something that cons<br/>
yellow to him.<br/>
<br/>
best of luck...<br/>

&gt; Yep Tyunes, that&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; idea...losing is something I sort of expect with him<br/>
&gt; being the level he is,<br/>
&gt; but I want to at least put a hurtin&#39; on him! I will<br/>
&gt; have to check to make sure<br/>
&gt; I can leave the board, that would be soooo funny!<br/>
&gt; Everyone would be like where<br/>
&gt; did she go? And I do have a friend I can borrow<br/>
&gt; claws from :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Heh, I can see it now: &quot;The bard is cheating!&quot; <br/>
&gt; Just<br/>
&gt; &gt; remember, running like the gingerbread man is what<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; do best;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There is a goblin Camp North of the chessboard.  A<br/>
&gt; &gt; 15th lvl pet will kill them in no time but they<br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep the pet occupied long enough for you to go<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; &gt; and melee the mage a bit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ...and borrow a thulian claw or something really<br/>
&gt; fast<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the genius who matched you up with a con-red<br/>
&gt; &gt; opponent. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d also work overtime to make 12th lvl, which you<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; easily do at the chessboard, but a quick place is<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Derv Camp in West Commons...you might even make 13<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; then.  You are still at a disadvantage but at<br/>
&gt; least<br/>
&gt; &gt; you would have bellow as an extra tool.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pet roots you...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If the pet roots you and you are singing Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can usually break root the next round...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; good luck...even if you don&#39;t win, make sure your<br/>
&gt; &gt; opponent knows he was in a fight!<br/>
