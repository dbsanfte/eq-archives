<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633416317"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ll say the same thing I told a guildmate who is mapping<br/>
&gt;the zones.  Maps are nice, but nothing beats just plain<br/>
&gt;knowing the terrain and topology.  You could drop me anywhere<br/>
&gt;in Butcherblock, North Ro, Oasis, the Commonlands, or Misty<br/>
&gt;Thicket and I would just *know* where I am, no need for a map.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m almost to that point with Greater Faydark, Steamfont,<br/>
&gt;South Ro, the Karanas, and Kithicor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most everyone I meet is impressed when I tell them which trees<br/>
&gt;or landmarks to use to set up a running vector directly from<br/>
&gt;one place to another (just hit autorun and go get something to<br/>
&gt;eat).  You don&#39;t learn this type of stuff from /loc or maps.<br/>
&gt;You learn it by playing the game.  So while /loc does diminish<br/>
&gt;the roleplaying nature of the game, it is by no means the<br/>
&gt;ultimate in terms of in-game navigation.  I&#39;ll note that in<br/>
&gt;the real world, the places where GPS is most useful are out at<br/>
&gt;sea and in the air, where landmarks are not readily available.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, John, I feel exactly the same way as you about knowing my way around, <br/>
but the &quot;turn on autorun and go get something to eat&quot; can be dangerous =)  I <br/>
found this out the hard way. I set myself to autorun in N Karana max speed <br/>
from E Karana zone to W Karana zone, and went to get a drink. Luckily i got <br/>
back JUST in time to save my ass as a passing Hill Giant decided to bash me, <br/>
STUN me, and interupt my song. He had me down to about 25% health by the <br/>
time i got away from him.<br/>
<br/>
One thing i HATE is getting bashed by a green aggro mob while passing it <br/>
(usually some type of undead) for 1 measly point of damage and it either <br/>
interrupts my song, stuns me causing me to stop, or both. &quot;Hear we go <br/>
again..&quot; I mutter as I have to switch to weapons to dispatch the critter. I <br/>
would just run and let them go, but I have a policy of killing any green mob <br/>
that dares aggro me while i&#39;m minding my own business, muahaha =) How DARE <br/>
they!<br/>
