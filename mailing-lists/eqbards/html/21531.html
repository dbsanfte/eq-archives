<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991685482">I&#39;ve been using it in Kaesora as an interrupt against Strathebone<br/>
Healers (I think they&#39;re around 30-33, it&#39;s a guess) and at 40 I get<br/>
about a 1/3 - 1/5 resist rate depending on cha and luck (low cha of<br/>
119, high cha of 134).  I could comfortably hold one and interrupt<br/>
heals when it was just a 43 pallie and myself but the addition of<br/>
anything else and we would have to book for zone.  Who needs rez when<br/>
you have screech?<br/>

&gt; question... at 28/29, Pixie Strike has been working very well.  At<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; point does it start to degenerate into the realms of uselessness, or<br/>
&gt; is it a<br/>
&gt; gradual thing?<br/>
