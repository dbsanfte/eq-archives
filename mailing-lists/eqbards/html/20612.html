Has anyone tried to get these at a low level? Or does anyone know SolB well<br/>
enough to say whether a low level could make the dash to loot them (and<br/>
survive waiting for them to drop)? Would I need inviso, or are there things<br/>
that see through it along the way (on, say a busy weekend night)?<br/>
<br/>
As a possibly inappropriate aside,  should there just HAPPEN to be someone<br/>
on the list who has spare money or items on Nameless and wants to have a<br/>
character on Povar who suddenly gets an inheritance, they should feel free<br/>
to contact me, Tszaaz/Tsengu would be happy to talk to you *smile*<br/>
