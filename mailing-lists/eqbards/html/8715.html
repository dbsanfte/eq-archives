<b>Subject:</b> basalt carapace <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-995232514">I went to lower Guk last night for the carapace.  There was a full group camping the<br/>
assassin and they were pulling the gargoyles so I asked and they consented to let me<br/>
loot one if they found it.  After a while one member left and I joined their group<br/>
and had a fine old time except that despite many rounds of gargoyles no carapace! <br/>
Talking to a few bards earlier I expected one every 3-4 spawns.  Anyway after 3-4<br/>
hours (and a petition after the second hour BTW) we got three in very quick<br/>
succession (and 2 were unwanted).  The clumpy random-number generator?  Not sure.<br/>
<br/>
So, to those folks who asked - you may if you are willing to wait either in lower or<br/>
upper Guk get the assassin group (or whoever is doing the gargoyles) to call you to<br/>
loot a carapace.  You&#39;ll need an invisible to undead though.<br/>
<br/>
Because the carapace took so long I didn&#39;t get to the lambent stone and I am glad I<br/>
did not as you all are saying the breastplate is broken 8(.  I was so hoping to put<br/>
this Lute of the Gypsy Princess to good use.<br/>
<br/>
On a cheerful note I bought a charred guardian breastplate while I was there which<br/>
was my desired armor before the new patch.  I hesitated thinking I would only wear<br/>
it a short time but hey I had wanted one for a long time and I am glad I did get it.<br/>
 I am back to the black bard look now (I had been wearing a steel BP).<br/>
