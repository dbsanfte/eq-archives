<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962015585">I keep my imbrued/Sentry/Guardian pieces in the bank for raids.  I wear my singing steel for grinding.  Each has a use.  <br/>
Other stuff?  I think tattered mantles are a good upgrade for shoulders.  drop off gullerback in BW.  He has a ton of hitpoints and is very MR but your other chants will do him in.  Just be careful, his arms are a lot longer than they look P<br/>

the pieces duplicate.  Example, I have SS helm and Imbrued helm, SS arms and<br/>
Imbrued arm...etc.  What is considered &quot;better&quot;?  SS is real nice AC, but<br/>
it&#39;s leaving my stats lacking.  Imbrued has some pretty good stats, but at<br/>
the cost of some AC.<br/>
<br/>
Some have mentioned they carry 2 sets of armor.  I&#39;d rather not do that,<br/>
since I quickly get encumbered now as it is.  Currently, my &quot;fresh from the<br/>
bank going out to do stuff&quot; weight is around 80/113.  Add some armor to<br/>
that, and I&#39;ll be starting out encumbered.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I really need to look at my shoulder, back, and waist slots.  My<br/>
shoulders is still blood stained mantle, back is, I think decent, but don&#39;t<br/>
know what my options are, and my waist is the Straw Spun Belt.  Decent AC at<br/>
10, but at 6 weight, I think it&#39;s too heavy.  I wouldn&#39;t mind options that I<br/>
could go and get myself solo, but I have a 51 shaman friend who can help.<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m 50, finally.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Any and all suggestions are very welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
