&gt; Again, a good idea.  How on earth could this be implemented?  The current<br/>
&gt; version of the song requires you to hold the item to be identified.  How<br/>
&gt; could you select which item to be identified from someone elses inventory?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just have the song invoke the identify spell effect for all<br/>
party members.  If they&#39;re not holding anything, it gives them<br/>
the &quot;you must be holding the item you wish to identify&quot;<br/>
message.  If they&#39;re holding something, identify it.<br/>

&gt; Only had this happen twice.  I&#39;m willing to chalk this up to the<br/>
&gt; unpredictable nature of summoned pets.  Perhaps they become disgruntled and<br/>
&gt; turn on their masters or us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I have it happen about once in every 5 battles where I<br/>
use charm.  It happens enough that it&#39;s a contributing reason<br/>
to why I don&#39;t use charm in group battles that much anymore.<br/>
The time I waste retargeting is better spent with other songs.<br/>

&gt; &gt;longer so that we can take advantage of it to coordinate party<br/>
&gt; &gt;movement while invisible (what GZ suggested we do last time).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;ve already said they won&#39;t change this.  This is a no win situation.<br/>
&gt; Some people want no glowing ball so its useful in PvP, others want a<br/>
&gt; permanent glowing ball so its easy to follow.  How to decide?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Either is better than the current glowing ball for 1 second<br/>
situation.  It&#39;s not long enough to be useful, but long enough<br/>
to be a liability.<br/>
