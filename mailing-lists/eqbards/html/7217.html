&gt; &gt;I think this Verant&#39;s punishment/reward for passive neglect...<br/>
&gt; &gt;you were there when a poor knoll pup was cruelly killed and did<br/>
&gt; &gt;not try to stop the attack, therefore you are as guilty as the<br/>
&gt; &gt;actual murder.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What am I supposed to do?  Taunt the player off the pup?<br/>
&gt; You cannot directly affect any NPCs in the game, so standing<br/>
&gt; by without taking action is your only recourse.  Unless you<br/>
&gt; want to duel the person over it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is the problem.  I&#39;m getting really tired of eating other<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s faction.  And I&#39;m not talking about gnolls.  Yesterday<br/>
&gt; some idiot necromancer kited one of those Barbarian Villagers<br/>
&gt; by my party near T3.  I&#39;m singing Clarity, so somehow I must be<br/>
&gt; helping someone, somewhere.  I take faction hits from that kiter&#39;s<br/>
&gt; kill.  I really like Halas, and I never kill barbarians.  So I<br/>
&gt; immediately cruised into Blackburrow for a stack of gnoll teeth<br/>
&gt; to turn into the Pit of Doom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People don&#39;t realize that faction adjustments are a _HUGE_ part<br/>
&gt; of what you can and cannot do in this game.  For example, if you<br/>
&gt; are ever considering wiping out Holly Windstalker or Cros Treewind<br/>
&gt; because they /con blue and you are bored, you had beter think again.<br/>
&gt; The faction adjustments those two carry alone, will make you KOS<br/>
&gt; in 3 or 4 cities... instantly, one kill, and blam.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you in beta that saw the numeric adjustments, you know<br/>
&gt; what I mean.  In beta, if you kill a gnoll pup you got +1 to the<br/>
&gt; guards of qeynos.  However, if you killed a good guard you got -50<br/>
&gt; to the guards of qeynos.  You would have to kill 50 gnolls to make<br/>
&gt; up for one qeynos guard.  So factions vary in intensity everywhere,<br/>
&gt; which doesn&#39;t click with a lot of people.  They see one message, and<br/>
&gt; think they&#39;ve taken -1 or +1 hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m still not sure how we get unearned faction, when clearly we<br/>
&gt; havent assisted another player in any other way.  This ties in<br/>
&gt; with &#39;Bard Hate&#39; if you think about it.  The game must have thought<br/>
&gt; I did something to earn the faction, thus I must have triggered<br/>
&gt; something in the monster to irritate them.  If this was a real<br/>
&gt; monster, and not a Barbarian NPC, I bet it would have turned on me.<br/>
