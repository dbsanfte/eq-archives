Actually, even though I&#39;d prefer this over any other modification of the 14th<br/>
lvl song, I&#39;m not suggesting that Bards *need* bind.  This is just in response<br/>
to the question put to the list.  However...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Repeat after me:<br/>
&gt;Bards will never get Binding.  Bards will never get Binding.  Bards will<br/>
&gt;never get Binding......<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bards will never get Binding.  Bards will never get Binding.  Bards will<br/>
never get Binding......<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; The other hybrids don&#39;t get bind...but we aren&#39;t really a hybrid class.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Each<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; other hybrid is a warrior/specific magic class.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Bards are complete hybrids.  Bards are warrior/casters (if you equate<br/>
&gt;casting to singing).  And with the mix of song types, they are a hybrid of<br/>
&gt;many different casters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m using hybrid in a specific sense...a proper noun as it were.  Not in the<br/>
generic sense of being a cross of any two things.  In EQ, a Hybrid class is a<br/>
warrior crossed with one particular class.  Therefore it&#39;s spells are a subset<br/>
of only that class.  IE, a shadowknight is a warrior with some necro spells.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are not a Hybrid in this sense, as we are not crossed with any other<br/>
class.  What we do have, are songs that emulate, but (and I must stress this)<br/>
are NOT other class spells.  The SK gets actual necro spells.  The bard doesn&#39;t<br/>
get any classes spells. We get spells that have similar effects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;As a result, they get magic<br/>
&gt;&gt; plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all<br/>
&gt;&gt;other<br/>
&gt;&gt; hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told,<br/>
<br/>
&gt;And Bards have much better battle skills than a cleric.  It isn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;close.  Bards are much closer to Rangers than Clerics in combat abilities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must defer to you in this, as I&#39;m only 13th level with my Bard, so I don&#39;t<br/>
know what kind of divergence occurs later.  However, at my level, the cleric I<br/>
party with is just as effective in melee as I am, and with a higher AC.  Happens<br/>
to be better right now, because she&#39;s using a cleric only magic weapon that is<br/>
pretty nice...but that&#39;s beside the point :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; then perhaps we can get a<br/>
&gt;&gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;To make up for it?  Bards have many advantages over the other hybrids in<br/>
&gt;magical abilities.  Name one other hybrid that can do damage in all these<br/>
&gt;ways: DD, AOE DD, DOT, Damage Shield.  Bards can increase just about every<br/>
&gt;stat and resistance.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Bards might be less combat worthy compared to other hybrids, but they have<br/>
&gt;much better spells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll agree that we get a wider spectrum of effects, I don&#39;t know that I would go<br/>
as far as saying that they are better.  While a Paladin doesn&#39;t get the Hymn, he<br/>
can save your life in a bad combat with his heal, and a Bard can&#39;t.  When you&#39;re<br/>
getting hit for 30 points a hit, the few points per tick you get from hymn won&#39;t<br/>
cut it.  Just an example.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I agree this is unlikely, but my main point is that we get a song<br/>
to cover just about every type of spell out there...<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s wrong with adding bind to the types of spells we emulate?  We have no<br/>
problem with emulating DD, DoT, Heal, Speed, Teleport, Levitate, Invis, ad<br/>
nauseum...so what&#39;s wrong with Bind?<br/>
