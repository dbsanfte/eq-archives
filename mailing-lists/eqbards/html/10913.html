<div id="ygrps-yiv-379006264">Greetings and Hi Frashii,<br/>
<br/>
Rambling wasnt the word pssssssssss (:))<br/>
<br/>
Yes the arena was pretty fun yesterday sorry I poofed like that so quick<br/>
some main breaker in my apartments went out :(<br/>
<br/>
I agree communication between bards in the best way to learn. The arena is<br/>
also one of the best ways.. every level I get a new song that I want to<br/>
learn EVERYTHING about me and my enchanter buddy run to the arena in fp and<br/>
cast away...  same when he gets a new spell level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know probably 90% of the bards on Tarew Marr. I consider my self the most<br/>
sociable of them all. I talk with everyone help everyone all the time. I<br/>
give away staff&#39;s of writhing like they are candy... I find so much pleasure<br/>
in talking bard talk and helping people. Some of the higher levelers I talk<br/>
to are kinda short with me but all in all they are good people (aite<br/>
50,mercedez 50, ryana 50, denuvian 30something)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THIS LIST its self has helped me emmensly. It has made me a better bard in<br/>
general. I dont use everything stated here for the fact it just doesnt work<br/>
for me.. but thats all part of it. everyone is different..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the SOS potions my enchanter bud appreciates it  :)<br/>

&gt;Heya all =) (Yet another rambling Frashii post),<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I use this method myself for power leveling lower people in my guild =)<br/>
&gt; (But upon relfection, MES would be a MUCH easier way to do this, Thanks<br/>
&gt;  Jaez!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I usually take 1 or 2 people to East Karana, pull a Undead Gnoll Reaver,<br/>
&gt;Gnoll Reaver or Griffawn (anything yellow/red to them) and beat it to<br/>
&gt;within an inch (cm) of its life, snare it, charm it, then lets the<br/>
&gt;newbies kill it off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They get GREAT exp, (Imagine killing reds for 2 hours with no downtime),<br/>
&gt;and I get the satisfaction of helping my guildmates and advertising how<br/>
&gt;cool bards are :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night, a bard on my server, Tuldar (thanks!), showed me just how<br/>
&gt;nifty Pixie Strike was in the Arena. I used it in Highpass Keep, and for<br/>
&gt;once, our finger wiggling casters didn&#39;t get hit once!!  I just constantly<br/>
&gt;played pixie strike (ignoring the &quot;Just play the mana song&quot;), while<br/>
&gt;weaving in the mana song, and my group was AMAZED.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;You mean, you sped up our attack, mana songed AND stopped the monster<br/>
&gt;from aggroing on the finger wigglers? WOW! Do you cook too?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What was I to do ?  I handed out Gnome and Troll shaped cookies with<br/>
&gt;bottles of Kalish (no milk in highpass keep).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I tend to get chosen for groups pretty quick now :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Moral(s) of the Story :<br/>
&gt;   1) Advertise, Advertise, Advertise<br/>
&gt;   Let people KNOW what tricks you are doing. They don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt;   what &#39;Eyes glaze over&#39; and &#39;Surrounded by Chains of Music&#39;<br/>
&gt;   mean. Communicate. You will find other people in your group<br/>
&gt;   will start to do the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   2) ALWAYS take an opportunity to chat with fellow bards. Make<br/>
&gt;   friends. As a class, we of all people need to talk shop<br/>
&gt;   a LOT. We have a TON of neat songs, but without the knowledge<br/>
&gt;   they are like that sewing machine in the other room. Ie. a<br/>
&gt;   great tool, but worthless because lack of skill and knowledge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   3) Take a night off occasionally to help lower leveled friends.<br/>
&gt;   They might be your groupmates some day if they suddenly gain<br/>
&gt;   a bunch of levels :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;PS. Wow did I get lucky. I found a Rune that a level 50 finger wigger<br/>
&gt; needed on a deepwater croc, and asked him if he would help my friend<br/>
&gt; (who I was there on a mission with me in Oasis) get the last spoke he<br/>
&gt;  needed from the deepwater goblin spire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Well, the mob agrod on him, and I went and tanked it until he could<br/>
&gt;  cast on it.    We had to zone (had 3 more there too), but when we came<br/>
&gt;  back, the one we killed HAD THE OPALINE HELM!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  At the time, I had NO idea what the helm was for I just thought,<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Look its black! I look soooo good!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Sure glad I looted it =D<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PPS. Could have looted a Gypsie Lute Last night<br/>
&gt;     had I been in Mistmoor... =(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PPPS. I Sure would like some different clothes to wear to weddings<br/>
&gt;      and such. I&#39;ve been the maid of honor at 2 weddings (3 on Saturday),<br/>
&gt;      and I&#39;ve attended them in either my all bronze (level 18 or so), or<br/>
&gt;      my current getup of &#39;TV Antenna&#39; (quick raise your right arm,<br/>
&gt;      channel 7 isnt coming in!) (all silvery).<br/>
&gt;       A Nice white dress would be nice :P </span></blockquote></div>
