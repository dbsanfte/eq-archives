same level, use similar tactics, and have comparable weapons and armour. I<br/>
can feel your pain when it comes to bard hate...one of my roleplaying /say<br/>
macros for use in such unpleasant combat situations is a droll &quot;Oh, sure,<br/>
pick on the Bard.&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My solution to the problem was a simple shift of location. Instead of<br/>
Unrest, where a pull of three mobs is common, try areas where single mobs<br/>
can be pulled relatively easily. I&#39;ve become a big fan of South Karana<br/>
recently. Aviaks are good hunting, and a good low-twenties group can handle<br/>
gnolls from the entrance to Paw. Get a bind in Arena so you&#39;re never far<br/>
from your corpse, and don&#39;t be afraid to equip the drum, hit Selo&#39;s, and do<br/>
what bards do best: Run Away Very Fast...there&#39;s plenty of room to run in<br/>
SK.<br/>
