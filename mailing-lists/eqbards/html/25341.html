<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761969345">First off, other bards have the same weps - one other bard that I personally<br/>
know of does.  I would guess that others do.<br/>
<br/>
Second, BotB and PvP is different.  Other factors come into play and there<br/>
is ample room for even good players to make mistakes - mistakes which can be<br/>
very costly. <br/>
<br/>
Third, some people will enter the competition even thought they &quot;know&quot; that<br/>
they can&#39;t win. For some, there is pride and honor in competeing - no matter<br/>
what the outcome is. I have a great deal of respect for that.<br/>
<br/>
On top of all that, we all know that this game rewards you for the amount of<br/>
time that spend doing the &quot;right stuff&quot; (gaining levels, getting good gear -<br/>
and in Thott&#39;s case *building* a powerful guild dedicated to these things to<br/>
make them happen a lot faster.)  Best of the Best - is gonna be the contest<br/>
for those who did these things.  And it is by no means &quot;simple&quot; to spend a<br/>
lot of time playing with a guild of most dedicated players not to mention<br/>
leading a guild like this.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am misunderstanding you, and the &quot;sour grapes&quot; or envy that I<br/>
detect in your comments is only in my imagination.  In any case, Verant does<br/>
also host contests where &quot;the playing field is level&quot; - look at the<br/>
gladiator tournement they hosted at Gencon where you competed with<br/>
identically leveled and equipped characters.  And yes, I think they should<br/>
reward the players who choose to play the game for its other aspects (role<br/>
playing) as well as the power gamers who got all the best gear.  But I see<br/>
no point in degrading one contest just because there are better ones that<br/>
could & should be done.<br/>
<br/>
Certain things are fundamental to this game: level and gear.  This contest<br/>
is all about that.  Other contests and events can be designed to focus on<br/>
the other aspects. I think it would would be entertaining and challenging to<br/>
have a tourney where the GM DT&#39;s each contestant and they are given the same<br/>
gear (or 1 sword and a shield, or choice of a generic Slashing, Piercing or<br/>
Blunt wep) to compete with.  <br/>
<br/>
Imho, Thott is hugely successful at this game and I think he has justly<br/>
earned his success.  It is more than just putting in the hours and being in<br/>
the most powerful guild on your server.  If that were all there is to it, I<br/>
(with my 250+ days played and 20 months in a power gamer guild) would be in<br/>
the oober guild rather than one that can barely muster 2 groups and has<br/>
trouble killing a level 56 mob. But that&#39;s not all that I play the game for<br/>
(level & gear) - I get most of my fun from the interaction with people and<br/>
working together to slay dragons or kill moss snakes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow - that&#39;s my humble opinion,<br/>

So, what Shada (retired) doesn&#39;t say outright is that there is no point for<br/>
anyone to enter the &quot;BoB&quot; besides Aftathott.  To completely refrain from<br/>
entering would be the best comment on these equipment contests.<br/>
<br/>
He who has the most time to play with the guild of most dedicated players,<br/>
wins.  Simple.<br/>
