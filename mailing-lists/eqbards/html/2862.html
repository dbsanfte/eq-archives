<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686108711">...and now what?  I want to trade it in for something better but I don&#39;t<br/>
know what.  I&#39;m a lvl 11 bard with a mino axe, and an almost complete<br/>
leather setup (which suggests rightly that I am dirt poor).  I don&#39;t know<br/>
if I should sell it for coin (what is the usual ceiling on these? 25 pp?)<br/>
or try trading it for a better weapon (the Dirk seems like a popular<br/>
choice), or even try trading it for banded (how many pieces?).  It seems<br/>
more logical that I would get a better price in a far off city from<br/>
Crushbone like Freeport or even Qeynos but can someone confirm? So I throw<br/>
this question to the masses..   <br/>
