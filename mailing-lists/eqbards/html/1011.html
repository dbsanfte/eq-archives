&gt; Okay here&#39;s the on-topic part: I would like to know where to get Tarew&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Aquatic Eye. I heard from Highpass Hold ONLY?? Is that true? Thanks.<br/>

I played around with this song last night.  It didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
matter whether I was using a flute or not.  Does anyone know<br/>
if there&#39;s a difference?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found that:<br/>
<br/>
1) Playing this song underwater let me breathe, but I still<br/>
lost stamina as if I were swimming.  I realize we have another<br/>
song just for stamina, but doesn&#39;t it seem rather silly that<br/>
we need to twist the two just to comfortably stay underwater?<br/>
Does the amount of stamina you lose decrease as you get higher<br/>
in level?<br/>
<br/>
2) Playing the song on dry land, you lose stamina as if you<br/>
are swimming.<br/>
<br/>
3) You cannot swim backwards.  Makes underwater combat a bit<br/>
tricky.<br/>

Yes, you can only get it in Highhold pass.<br/>

You have to go into High Hold itself (another zone in HH<br/>
Pass).  Inside in the back are two libraries.  One has a man<br/>
selling wizard spells.  The other has a man selling bard<br/>
spells (named Justin Rhymes or something, ha ha).  There is a<br/>
bank in High Hold, so you don&#39;t have to risk any valuable<br/>
equipment and money on the trip over; although the place was<br/>
so camped when I went (the mobs there give no less than three<br/>
highly desired magic items) that I didn&#39;t even need<br/>
Accelerando and just walked in.  The layout of HH Pass is<br/>
rather confusing, and if you don&#39;t mind getting a map online,<br/>
I suggest you do so.  There are no 90 degree turns in the<br/>
place, and it&#39;s very easy to get disoriented.<br/>
