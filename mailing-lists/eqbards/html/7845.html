out looking for giants or griffins to charm when I heard<br/>
someone blathering something about the only good wood elf<br/>
being a dead one.  I&#39;d tried to solo him before, and managed<br/>
to get him down to half before he got 4 or 5 lucky hits in and<br/>
I had to run.  (It was a very close thing since he cast<br/>
engulfing darkness on me, which I found out overrides<br/>
Accelerando unless you have Accelerando playing when he casts<br/>
it and you don&#39;t stop it.)<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t holding his normal halberd so I asked over /guildsay<br/>
if anyone was nearby WC and willing to help me take out Zytl<br/>
with a dirk.  A monk was in Kithicor so he quickly zoned into<br/>
WC.  I stopped running in circles and lead Zytl to the<br/>
Kithicor zone.  We grouped and proceeded to pound him into the<br/>
ground.  At L35 and 30, we were both left at about half health<br/>
when we&#39;d finished.  He did indeed have the dragoon dirk, so<br/>
you can get it off him if he&#39;s not holding a halberd.<br/>
