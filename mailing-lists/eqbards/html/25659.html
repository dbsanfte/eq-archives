SoL weapons<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was curious about this myself when I started seeing these weapons<br/>
posted.  <br/>
<br/>
This is just thought as I have not talked to anyone about them, just<br/>
what I figured when I saw them and a very little amount of information I<br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe it adds to the damage stat of the weapon.  At first people<br/>
thought it raised your minimum damage by that amount, but another test I<br/>
saw showed that it increased the damage stat of the weapon.  I think<br/>
someone at a low level with a 6/30 +1 Undead weapon would hit for max 13<br/>
against normal mobs but max 15 against skels.  Small test but follows<br/>
what you said, that fighting Undead with a 10/20 +4 Undead weapon<br/>
becomes 14/20.  It is easy to see how Undead or Grimling damage<br/>
modifieres work but I do not understand how Fire, Cold, and Magic damage<br/>
works.  I would love to know.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the skill modifiers, it seemed to me that it would add that<br/>
percentage to your skill in that area while using the item.  If you had<br/>
a meditate skill of 200 and were wearing a +5% meditate item, your skill<br/>
would work as if it was 210.  Again, just a thought.  If that is the<br/>
case, I wonder if it goes above the cap for that skill.  If not, they<br/>
would be pretty worthless if that is how they work, since everyone at 60<br/>
most likely has their skills maxxed anyway.  If they work differently,<br/>
such as you said just adding 5% damage with that weapon or medding 5%<br/>
faster without actually having to add skill points, then the higher-end<br/>
ones seem pretty powerful.  It is a neat way to add to your class<br/>
without just getting new items or AA skills. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t play anymore so this could all be completely off hehe.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Questions about the new attributes on some new SoL<br/>
weapons<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I sent this to several of the EQ Yahoo group I belong to in hopes<br/>
someone will know the answer. With the release of SoL and all the new<br/>
armor<br/>
and weapons, there are many new attributes given to weapons. I have<br/>
listed a<br/>
few weapons below. Some of the new weapons have various damage<br/>
attributes<br/>
given to some weapons. I have seen lots of different types. Some of that<br/>
I&#39;ve seen are Fire Damage, Magic Damage,  Undead Bane Damage, Cold<br/>
Damage,<br/>
Grimling Bane Damage and many others I am sure. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how these weapon will work? What kind of impact will<br/>
these<br/>
modifications have on the damage output? Does a 10 damage 20 delay with<br/>
a 4<br/>
damage undead turn into a 14 damage 20 delay verses undead mobs? I am<br/>
sure<br/>
this can&#39;t be true, but I&#39;d sure like to know how this works.<br/>
<br/>
Also, other weapons are popping up with skill type bonuses. For example,<br/>
I<br/>
saw a 2 hand blunt weapon that had a + 5 % to 2 hand blunt. Now does<br/>
this 5%<br/>
go to your 2 hand blunt skill? Or is it that you will hit for 5% more<br/>
damage. How does this work. I also saw an item that had 3% lock picking<br/>
skill gloves, a HtH held item that gave like 2% hand to hand. I am sure<br/>
there are a lot more of these to be found.<br/>
<br/>
I f anyone has any thought or knowledge on how these attributes affect<br/>
the<br/>
player, please post. I hope this was not too confusing.<br/>
