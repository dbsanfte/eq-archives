&gt; Last night in lower guk a fellow was auctioning a &quot;shark-skin drum&quot; that he<br/>
&gt; said he picked up in Kedge Keep and he claimed that a bard friend who tested<br/>
&gt; it for him said that it was about 15% faster speed increase over the MM<br/>
&gt; drum.  I tried to trade an Enameled Black Chestplate for it but he wanted<br/>
&gt; like 10kpp worth of stuff for it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A old fishing buddy of mine had an interesting trait.  He<br/>
always exaggerated the weights and lengths of the fish he<br/>
caught.  What was unusual was that he subconciously always<br/>
exaggerated by the same amount, even though he was terrible at<br/>
math.  I found that dividing his claims by 1.7 almost always<br/>
gave the proper weight and length.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found a similar rule holds true for people selling stuff.<br/>
Divide all claims of &quot;increase&quot; by 2.0.  If the drum even<br/>
exists, which I doubt since a 15% greater effect than the MM<br/>
drum would rank it better than Selo&#39;s drum of march.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will make up anything to make a sale.  I had a<br/>
fellow try to trade me a lute of the gypsy princess claiming<br/>
his bard friend tested it and it increased string songs by<br/>
30%, even though many people on this list have tested it and<br/>
found no improvement.<br/>
