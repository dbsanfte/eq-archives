<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272556619">No idea why the mobs 30 levels below you do this.  I see blue mobs do it to<br/>
me only about 25% of the time.  Maybe there is something broken in the break<br/>
out routine that just doesn&#39;t show up until higher levels.  I haven&#39;t had<br/>
any trouble using it lately.  Its acting pretty much the way it has since I<br/>
got it.  A mob nods, sometimes he attacks me anyhow if I&#39;m right next to him<br/>
but only 25-30% of the time.  It could be some negative chance to break out<br/>
got thru the code and is interpreted as a positive percentage I suppose.<br/>
Since I never get to those negative points it never happens to me.  I can<br/>
sit there and lullaby fire beetles all day though with only the very<br/>
occasional (maybe 5%) bite coming thru.  They are only 18 levels below me<br/>
but that&#39;s the closest I can get to your situation.  Is it happening with<br/>
all mobs or just a few types at those levels?  Just reporting what I have<br/>
encountered, not sure why it is behaving differently at much higher levels.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been using Lullaby a lot recently to take down multiple blues while<br/>
&gt; soloing.  From what I have observed, it seems to work similarly to our<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; songs.  When the effect goes off the mobs get a chance to resist.  If they<br/>
&gt; fail to resist they nod.  When they would next get to attack they get a<br/>
&gt; chance to break the nod, if they do they attack.  Just as with some other<br/>
&gt; songs this results in the effect getting broken before it ever costs the<br/>
MOB<br/>
&gt; anything.<br/>
<br/>
So why do mobs that are 30 levels lower than me seem to<br/>
&quot;succeed&quot; at this &quot;second resist&quot; about 60%-80% of the time?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I forget offhand what the other songs are that function this way, but I<br/>
&gt; remember John lamenting on the fact that the song could work and be broken<br/>
&gt; before it really had any effect.  I have seen it to always interrupt a<br/>
&gt; caster if they nod though in my experience, but then again I haven&#39;t been<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the Temple of Cazic Thule. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I know something similar happens with root.  However, if mobs<br/>
were breaking root at anywhere near the frequency they&#39;re<br/>
&quot;breaking out&quot; of Lullaby and Pixie Strike, the casters would<br/>
string GZ up by the... ahem.  Anyhow, the fact that Pixie<br/>
Strike works much better if you successfully get one to stick<br/>
leads me to believe this is a bona fide bug, and not a high<br/>
&quot;second resist&quot; effect.  If it were just a &quot;second resist&quot;<br/>
effect, then it shouldn&#39;t matter whether or not you&#39;ve gotten<br/>
one Pixie Strike to stick.<br/>
