<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857686545">Well, I finally got out of the first level of hell, and was able to try the<br/>
song I had prebought two weeks prior to hitting 31, Agilmente&#39;s Aria of<br/>
Eagles.  Boy was it nice.  Not only did it levitate me, but when it pulses<br/>
it actually raises you up a bit, so when it pulses during the highest point<br/>
of the wavey motion, it actually lifts you higher.  I took it through<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, soaring past the aqua goblin camp, and paying no heed to<br/>
the steep cliffs.  I entered Unrest and floated around in the outside a bit.<br/>
I perched atop the small island to the right next to the gazebo, and<br/>
attempted to fly over to the door&#39;s canopy.  I didn&#39;t quite make it, and no<br/>
sooner was I simultaneously attacked by a Greater Dark Bone, a Tentacle<br/>
Terror, and a Dark Terror from the depths of the basement.  These were no<br/>
where to be seen, but my text box was spammed with red.  My health quickly<br/>
dropped, and despite my efforts to flee, my pursuers were always right on my<br/>
tail.  I eventually fell to their blows and received a birds eye view of my<br/>
corpse while I loaded to my home point.  Rather than being in the courtyard,<br/>
as I was when I died, my corpse was in a cavernous very basement like area.<br/>
Seems as I was floating serenely around unrest I was really floating noisily<br/>
down in the basement and disturbing the peace of some very nasty creatures<br/>
that dwell therein.  Three hours later, after delving fully invis into the<br/>
basement scouring it&#39;s entirety for my corpse, locating it through a wall,<br/>
and dealing with a very uncooperative guide (who said it was VERY<br/>
retreivable and levitation worked just fine) it was summoned to me, and I<br/>
went about my merry way.  The point of this story is to ask at any attempts<br/>
at an explanation as to why this happened, and how I can safely use<br/>
levitation.  It really is a blast as I thought it would be, but who knows<br/>
what mischeif and trouble I could get myself into in other multi level<br/>
dungeons.  So, sorry for rambling, but has anyone else experienced this, and<br/>
does anyone want to venture an explanation?<br/>
