&gt; Well last night while praying for trains in mistmoore so me and another<br/>
&gt; bardic friend could try to pick off a gypsie or a deathly usher i got bored<br/>
&gt; and decided to go pull some stuff....   So i go to the cemetary, i see a<br/>
&gt; named invisible npc with a book in hand named something like Ssinn or<br/>
&gt; something like that. Hmmm i think to myself, maybe its the red robe npc and<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s green to me and scowling ready to attack.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, to make a long story short, i screwed up big time, Turns out it was<br/>
&gt; a quest npc for the sol ro temple<br/>
&gt; your faction with sol ro got worse<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh.  We did the same thing.  I&#39;m constantly telling everyone<br/>
to con stuff before they attack, because I&#39;ll end up receiving<br/>
any bad faction hits they take.  But as usual they charged<br/>
right in and attacked, and considering we had three other mobs<br/>
on us at the time (yeah, another guy was pulling while this<br/>
was going on), I didn&#39;t have much choice but to help.<br/>
<br/>
This book guy is like all shadowmen - he /cons ready to<br/>
attack, but is non-aggressive.  Hail him.  If he calls you a<br/>
piece of refuse, hit him with the faction song.  He should<br/>
tell you about a quest to retrieve a flower from inside the<br/>
crypt.  Go inside the crypt (walk straight in because on<br/>
either side of the floor is a pit trap).  On the coffin<br/>
there&#39;s a bag, which is really a flower.  Pick it up and give<br/>
it to the book.  The flower respawns every few minutes so you<br/>
can do this over and over.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re beyond the point where the faction song helps, then<br/>
I hear there are other quests you can do to raise your faction<br/>
with Solusek Ro.<br/>
<br/>
Always /con and hail new stuff before you attack.<br/>
