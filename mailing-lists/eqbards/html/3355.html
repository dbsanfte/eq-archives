<div id="ygrps-yiv-612567595">Well, I believe it was Shad who originally posted it, but I will repost it<br/>
for you as you asked, and for anyone else who wants it! (smile)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, all of these are in Cazic Thule -<br/>
<br/>
Bracer - Tae Ew Diviner - Throne Room<br/>
Leggings - Tae Ew Templar - Throne Room<br/>
Helm - Stone Golem - Upstairs Throne Room<br/>
Gloves - Steel Golem - Maze<br/>
Sleeves - Tae Ew Archon - Pyramid<br/>
Boots - Cenobite - Avatar Area<br/>
Breastplate - Avatar - Avatar Area<br/>
<br/>
This is all from memory, so it COULD be wrong. I am sure someone will<br/>
correct it if it is. (smile!)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

&gt;Hail Good Bards,<br/>
&gt;Someone put out a neat list of which Tae dropped which piece of rubicite.<br/>
&gt;This topic came up yesterday and even though I thought I had saved that<br/>
&gt;note, I can not seem to find it. Can someone send that back to me? I have<br/>
&gt;gone for the skald type bard in role play and am now heavily relied upon<br/>

&gt;I finally started working up piercing and it&#39;s definitely going to take<br/>
&gt;awhile to raise it, probably because it is equipped secondary. Just started<br/>
&gt;in the courtyard of Cazi, amazing lag and spam there!<br/>
&gt;Has anyone noticed the song vendor in HH having been moved? I went to get<br/>
&gt;song 23 last night and he was gone. I didn&#39;t have time for a full scale<br/>
&gt;search.<br/>
