<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  this isn&#39;t at all good for a bard.  plus you aren&#39;t likely to see<br/>
  many of these.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Mithril Greaves = hella good<br/>
&gt; Mithril Vambraces = hella good<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  huh?????  I am willing to bet oh, about 5k pp that this wizard<br/>
  didn&#39;t intend on, nor had either of these to trade.  Just a hunch.<br/>
  No wizard gets these items when raiding Tranix.  That would be <br/>
  incredibly stupid.<br/>
<br/>
  This wizard had one too many bracers from lucky randoms in the<br/>
  king room.  And maybe a bp in the bank he wanted to get rid of<br/>
  so he could pick up another.<br/>
