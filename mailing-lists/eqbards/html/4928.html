&gt; Got my greaves and breastplate to go with everything else. Now all i need<br/>
&gt; is the arms and gloves and i got the visible set, course the other bard on<br/>
&gt; the server has the gloves and arms only....<br/>
&gt; We also killed more phobo&#39;s tonight and they dropped ANOTHER bracer on top<br/>
&gt; of the two from before. But they didnt drop any other bard armour.<br/>

piece of this bad boy armor! I want to have something to drool over while I<br/>
toil away killing the darkies in Mistmore.<br/>
