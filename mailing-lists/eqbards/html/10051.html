&gt; Why are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 49?<br/>
&gt; When we was finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave some room for<br/>
&gt; expansion during the evolution of EverQuest. Because Bards get one song<br/>
 </span></blockquote>per<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; level, if we had given them all fifty songs there would have been no room<br/>
&gt; for expansion - aside from taking away older songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Expect to see new songs coming soon. These songs will not be anything that<br/>
&gt; radically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions that help<br/>
&gt; keep the Bard interesting at high levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks Geoffrey!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So does this mean they are NOT going to have new songs for the levels over<br/>
50??? That seems odd to me if it is the case.<br/>
