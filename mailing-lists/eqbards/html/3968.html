&gt;may be a specialization for 50+ level Bards, but how to choose?  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think I would like to trade my diversity to specialize.  In fact, that is<br/>
&gt;one of my chief reasons for choosing the Bard class in the first place.<br/>

instrument that is their specialty.  Then using it would have an increased<br/>
effect (for certain songs), and actually drain mana if one specialized in<br/>
that instrument type.  Once the mana was gone, the effects would be similar<br/>
to non-specialized play.<br/>
