<b>Subject:</b> RE: Question about game pad <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-412886535">Oohh but I love my Gravis Gamepad pro USB :o) and I dont think it makes me the<br/>
least anti social....<br/>
<br/>
I keep it right next to my keyboard and have mapped it with the following<br/>
keyboard sequences (You might need to insert a delay between some keypresses):<br/>
1         - &lt;F2&gt; /ASSIST &lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
2         - &lt;F3&gt; /ASSIST &lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
3         - &lt;F4&gt; /ASSIST &lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
4         - &lt;F5&gt; /ASSIST &lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
start          - &lt;F6&gt; /ASSIST &lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
select         - &lt;shift&gt;+5 delay 1 delay 5 (forage+sense heading)<br/>
<br/>
red button     - /pet attack &lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
xxx button     - /pet back up &lt;ENTER&gt; (dont remember which colors they have)<br/>
yyy button     - /pet guard here &lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
zzz button     - /pet follow me &lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Esp the mapping of assist is really really nice. I never have to worry about<br/>
setting up an assist key and can switch the person I assist in a jiffy.<br/>
Only thing that could be better would be if the pad was designed to be on the<br/>
table. The 1, 2, 3 and 4 buttons are not that well placed.<br/>
I have also fiddled a bit around with using it for twisting and while I got it<br/>
working with something along: 1 delay(X000mS) 2 delay(50mS) 2 delay(X000mS) 1<br/>
delay(50mS) repeat.... I quickly realised that it makes it damned hard to switch<br/>
to a new set of songs as I could risk a delay of several seconds until I had<br/>
fully control over start and stopping of songs. Further more twisting is so<br/>
grown into my fingers that it dont seem like much of a hazzle anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it. With my gamepad - I have the perfect macro program for<br/>
EQ... As far as I remember it can even emulate mouse movement and clicks, but I<br/>
havent ventured into that yet (and proberly wont).<br/>

&gt;A game pad is not the best choice for playing everquest, unless you plan on<br/>
&gt;being antisocial.=) you need access to the keyboard at almost all times to<br/>
&gt;play. It really isn&#39;t an action game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are some programmable Joysticks out there by Gravis that are pretty<br/>
&gt;good.<br/>

&gt;I am trying to buy a game pad that I can use with EQ but I have not been<br/>
&gt;very successful at it.  So I was wondering if anyone out there that got a<br/>
&gt;game pad working for them pls advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
