&gt; &gt;   During the Lucan fight, I tossed everything I had at the guy<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and right before the party wiped him out, I zoned out.  Was<br/>
&gt; &gt;   a pretty fun night, and I still can visit the bard guild in<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Freeport &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m upset about this. First time I fought Lucan it was a close fight, we&#39;d<br/>
&gt;had to zone 2 times already and our two highest level players left so I was<br/>
&gt;2nd high man on the totem pole at 43. I couldn&#39;t leave and expect that the<br/>
&gt;rest of the group could survive the reincarnate. Ugh.  My group, got the<br/>
&gt;experience which was a shock, but even more shocking, I went from<br/>
&gt;indifferent to scowls even in wolf form!! ARGH!  The cleric in my group who<br/>
&gt;was dubious before the fight also got the faction hit for both kills and is<br/>
&gt;still dubious, WTF?!?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can still go to the bard&#39;s guild, I just have to announce a train and <br/>
&gt;make<br/>
&gt;sure I have my drum out when I run through East or West Freeport.  I used <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;go invis but the militia scum has added a couple of guards that see invis<br/>
&gt;now so that strategy no longer works.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They can&#39;t kill me if they can&#39;t catch me!!<br/>

entrance through the tunnels, just as fast as running thourgh town.  The <br/>
only think I miss is unmolested shoping in the Commons & N Ro :) But I am <br/>
