<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116040164">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
The other day My 45th bard was grouped with a wiz old friend. He said he ran<br/>
into some unicorn and killed it a while back and that he got a &quot;unicorn<br/>
horn&quot;  but didnt know if it was special or not.<br/>
<br/>
I told him give it to me ill do a quick test ( we were in lower guk so didnt<br/>
want to waste To much time).<br/>
<br/>
Well first I fired up Invis with it and it was a wind instrament. So then I<br/>
pixie striked my self 3 times to watch the MR lower.<br/>
<br/>
1. No instrament my mr loweres 8<br/>
2. Normal Wood Flute my mr lowers14 points<br/>
3. Unicorn horn my mr lowers 17 points ( average like 22% increase or<br/>
someting )<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 50th necro and been bored with the game a bit . But my<br/>
question is, well no question. Is there anymore to this horn? I actually<br/>
have never heard of it and those are all the tests I did with it.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to know if anyone else knows anymore about this horn. Possible<br/>
other uses for it and also what Purge spell is ( it has 5 charges)<br/>
<br/>
Also this has no hand graphic on me wood elf bard. It does do the Piper<br/>
Animation though :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time.<br/>
