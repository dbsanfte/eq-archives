<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081964689">My favourite place so far has been in the Swamp of No Hope.  There are<br/>
rarely any more than 10 people there, and they&#39;re mostly Iksars.<br/>
<br/>
There are three entrances to the Swamp from Firiona Vie - one to the left of<br/>
the zone and two very close together on the right.  I go in at the right;<br/>
either entrance as they both lead to the same spot. If you come across the<br/>
head of a large Iksar statue, you&#39;re at the wrong spot and should head West.<br/>
<br/>
Not far from the zone, there&#39;s a spot near the Southwest edge of the Froglok<br/>
village where three frogs spawn - usually Gaz Warriors, occasionally a<br/>
Shaman.  You&#39;ll also come across large Bloodvein mosquitos, Man Eating<br/>
Plants and Giant Leeches in that area.<br/>
<br/>
Careful use of Lament will pick off unwanted frogs. You&#39;ll have the place to<br/>
yourself. Be very, very careful if you want to explore the Froglok village -<br/>
they move fast when they aggro (*rubs bruises*)</div>
