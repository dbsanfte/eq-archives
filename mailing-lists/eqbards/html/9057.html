&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember Bard Hate in my earlier years while hunting in Unrest.  While<br/>
&gt; camping on the left wall waiting for my group&#39;s puller to return with some<br/>
&gt; fair, I heard the shout &quot;Hag to zone&quot;.  At this time I was sing anthem to<br/>
&gt; ensure that my group was ready to handle the pull.  Now what did I see, a<br/>
&gt; paladin running out of the house over the railing of the porch with a hag<br/>
&gt; and two dry bones in tow.  Not really thinking for a second, I was totally<br/>
&gt; baffled when the hag stopped, turned and headed straight for me.  Of<br/>
&gt; course being level 21 at the time I could only survive 2 blasts of her<br/>
&gt; force shock and a couple hits from the carrion ghoul.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If this is not bard hate then I don&#39;t know what is.<br/>

<br/>
The main reason the Hag went for you was not because you were a Bard, but<br/>
because you were buffing everyone in your party.<br/>
<br/>
During the beta, there was a detailed explanation of how mobs decide who to<br/>
attack.  They build up a hate list depending on the actions of all the<br/>
players around it.  Healing and buffing are major taunts which can get the<br/>
monster switched onto you.  This happens even if your group is not fighting<br/>
the monster, but within a certain range.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe there is a randomness factor somehow.  The monster can<br/>
sometimes target someone not at the top of it&#39;s hate list.  There may be<br/>
some randomness here.  I&#39;ve been randomly targeted playing many different<br/>
classes, not just bards.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the &quot;Bard Hatred&quot; is caused by Bard songs.  Then when you add in the<br/>
rare Random Attack when you haven&#39;t been singing, you get convinced that<br/>
everything is attacking you because of Bard Hate.<br/>
