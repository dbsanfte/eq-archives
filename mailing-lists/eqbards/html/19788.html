<div id="ygrps-yiv-803951437">Well it&#39;s bad enough to have lost the MM drum a week and a half ago.  I<br/>
camp Kaesora for about three hours and finally get the coin there - the last<br/>
one I need.  Get a TP to Odus from my Guildmaster - Druid - get the Gem.<br/>
Run from the Druid TP circle in Dreadlands to Fironia Vie.<br/>
<br/>
	Happily give the gem and get the box (messed that one once before - my<br/>
Bad - forgot to leave a slot open).  I  use Cataloging Libretto to make sure<br/>
I have six unique coins (I have one duplicate) put them in the box.  Hand<br/>
the Box to the NPC - and he says &quot;This item is nothing I seek&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	To add insult to injury - at 1:45 AM on a weeknight - it took almost 2<br/>
hours for the Guide to respond that he can&#39;t do anything and I have to email<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqtesting@...">eqtesting@...</a><br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;m reporting this as a bug - but did I do something wrong?  Does it matter<br/>
what order the coins are inserted in the box?  In hind-sight the NPC said I<br/>
need to &quot;Combine&quot; them in the box.  Is &quot;Combining&quot; something special I<br/>
needed to do?<br/>
<br/>
	While it would be nice to expect a response from Verant - I&#39;m guessing I<br/>
can get another set of the coins before I get a response from my email.<br/>
