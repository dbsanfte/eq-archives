<div id="ygrps-yiv-943486541">haha grats, on the kills and the mask.  i am such a well-known gnome hater<br/>
that if i ever happen to get this mask i think the server will crash.  we<br/>
got 2 more keys last night, and while the first 18-24 keys were assigned to<br/>
people, last night the 2 were randomed to whoever could be there tonight.  i<br/>
work, not that i have a chance of winning any lotto with more than just me<br/>
in it.<br/>
