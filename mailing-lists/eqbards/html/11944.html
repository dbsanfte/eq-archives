&gt;It probably is. Anything involving camping IS taking advantage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In a REAL tabletop game, the game ending wouldn&#39;t keep the person <br/>
&gt;from being angry at you. But that is the difference between computers<br/>

Then you just gate out and zone right back in no problem. Matter of fact, i<br/>
never camp out with my necromancer, he just gates out and zones back in,<br/>
being bound right outside. Problem solved. But the bard camps cause<br/>
otherwise he has to hitch a ride and hoof it back to the gate. Not a<br/>
problem, just takes longer than a 30 second camp out.</div>
