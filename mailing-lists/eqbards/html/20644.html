 </span></blockquote>I was in a great group last night.  I suppose it helped that we were all<br/>
guildmates, but I&#39;d never fought with any of them before.  We (12 bard, 11<br/>
warrior, 14 cleric, 15 druid) were hunting around and on either side of the<br/>
Lavastorm/Najena zone line.  In Lavastorm I was mixing<br/>
hymn/elemental/bellow, then hymn/anthem/bellow in Najena. For the most part<br/>
we had one mob at a time, but at one point the warrior pulled an ogre guard<br/>
& three large skeletons came with it.  The skely&#39;s were blue to my so, with<br/>
lute equipped I started weaving hymn/CoD.  My theory was that the warrior<br/>
could do a lot more damage to the ogre than me except that she was getting<br/>
stunned left & right by the skellys.  Better for me to get stunned, right?<br/>
I no sooner pulled them off her when I hear on of my party scream  &quot;ON BARD<br/>
ON BARD&quot;  The cleric then proceeded to pull the skelly&#39;s off me.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
felt so loved!  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Heh, of course they completely defeating my purpose and extending the<br/>
fight....<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
