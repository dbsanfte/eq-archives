&quot;it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the roleplayers mantra and that is perfectly fine with me.  But it<br/>
seems kind of silly to want the game changed because of YOUR image of a<br/>
class.  Lets look at another example:<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite fantasy characters is Conan.  Normally Conan goes around<br/>
fighting with a sword and loincloth.  Instead of relying on armor to deflect<br/>
blows, he uses his dexerity, agility, and skills to avoid being hit.  So<br/>
lets move that over to Everquest.  Cool, I can be a Barbarian Warrior and I<br/>
can wield a big 2-hand sword.  Now I don&#39;t need any armor, as it would only<br/>
slow me down making me less able to dodge a blow.  Unfortunately in EQ, a<br/>
warrior without armor is toast.  So should Verant change the game so the<br/>
character I want to play fits my image of what it should be?<br/>
<br/>
There are over 50,000 EQ players, each of whom have a slightly different<br/>
&quot;image&quot; of what they want to play.  There is no way that EQ can match<br/>
everyone&#39;s image.  So instead, Verant created their own images of what they<br/>
thought would be best.  And it is up to the players to examine Verant&#39;s<br/>
images and decide what image fits best with what they want to play.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to bards and armor specifically, why should bards get a bonus when<br/>
wearing a lighter armor when no other class (excluding monks) gets this<br/>
advantage?  Every other class would cry foul on this one.  Instead of asking<br/>
Verant to change the way AC is calculated for Bards ask for some rare<br/>
bard-only leather armor that has an AC slightly less than Plate.<br/>
<br/>
And what is the AC of studded leather and reinforced leather?  Once the<br/>
trade patch comes thru, it might be more realistic to wear these better<br/>
leathers.  Would the bards be happy with reinforced leather if it was<br/>
halfway between plain leather and plate?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to binding, if bards could bind, then every other class will want to be<br/>
able to bind too.  Bind Affinity is very useful.  Bards are not underpowered<br/>
compared to most other classes.  If we get Bind, then other classes will<br/>
have to get something to &quot;stay even&quot;.  Sad, but true, imagine the complaints<br/>
from all the non-spellcasting classes if we got Bind.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, this debate has certainly heated things up.  Its clear there is an<br/>
&gt;easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>
&gt;image of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>
&gt;while sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bazooka too.  Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>
&gt;is moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard.  to me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;image is more important than being as effective as possible.  I kinda wish<br/>
&gt;they&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>
&gt;light armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>
&gt;even equal, just better than nothing.  If not, oh well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I like the idea of having some bard specific items.  Singing swords,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;have items tailored towards them with the exception of bards.  Oh yeah sure<br/>
&gt;we can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>
&gt;like a monk, why would we?  It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt;could make better use of than anyone else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>
&gt;The way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>
&gt;they should travel more than any other character.  To have to do this<br/>
&gt;without being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>
&gt;minstrel could bind himself anywhere. </span></blockquote></div>
