<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365784810">I just got a &quot;Icepaw war claw&quot; this weekend in Velektors. If you like the<br/>
freddy kruger look . They are not that bad... 9/24 +3AGI Primary only (could<br/>
have been fun to dual wield)<br/>
<br/>
I also got the Kobold Jesters Crown (ac15 cha30 agi5 int-30 dex-5 wt0.0) Not<br/>
the perfect item for skill increases, but I think I will use it when<br/>
charming. Besides it dont weigh anything, so its &quot;free&quot; to drag around.<br/>
<br/>
Both items dropped in the village. The Crown of a named. and the claws of a<br/>
normal kobold I think<br/>

&gt; You very well maybe right and even if there isnt a low delay <br/>
&gt; cap that makes<br/>
&gt; other weapons even better, because there IS max haste.  5/24 <br/>
&gt; + max haste is<br/>
&gt; still slower and less dmg then 9/18 + max haste or even 6/23 <br/>
&gt; which would be<br/>
&gt; pathetic as well.  The only way I see this weapon being worth <br/>
&gt; a flip is if<br/>
&gt; its a proc, the proc lasts a descent amount of time, and you <br/>
&gt; find yourself<br/>
&gt; in a group without a bard/enchanter or shaman.  Otherwise I think its<br/>
&gt; nothing more than eye candy.  Dont get me wrong I like good <br/>
&gt; looking gear I<br/>
&gt; have a set of wicker armor I wear on my Iksar monk from time <br/>
&gt; to time when<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just trying to look &quot;cool&quot;  hehe.  But unless you are <br/>
&gt; rich or really<br/>
&gt; just want to look good I think the weapon is going to be over priced.<br/>

&gt; It is definitely a twink weapon.  The only one I have seen was on a<br/>
&gt; twink, and it does look awesome.  And I think the low delay <br/>
&gt; cap is just<br/>
&gt; a rumor, refuted by tests.  No not my tests I am too lazy, just from<br/>
&gt; what I have read.<br/>

&gt; I think it is trash.  5dmg?  That&#39;s pathetic.  The haste is irrelevant<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; you can only have one haste item and one haste &quot;spell&quot; at any given<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; 5dmg is dreadfully low and there is a limit as to how low, even with<br/>
&gt; haste,<br/>
&gt; the dly on a weapon can be.  Max haste isnt that hard to get, and 5/24<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; rotten, jade mace 9/18 less than 10k on my server and I am sure lots<br/>
&gt; cheaper<br/>
&gt; on others.  If you are just looking for the looks then maybe <br/>
&gt; you will be<br/>
&gt; happy with it.  But as a weapon for anyone high enough to <br/>
&gt; actually group<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; get it.  You probably already have better.  <br/>
