was actually a level 1 paladin in the room waiting for a carapace to drop so<br/>
he could wear it as armor.  Later on that day, a level 5 bard twink came<br/>
wandering into the room to loot a mask.  The scary part is they both felt<br/>
perfectly safe in the tower.  Not enough spawns to scare anyone away in<br/>
these dungeons anymore... Most mages and Necros I know get there pet spells<br/>
the immediately when they level or they already have them on them...<br/>
