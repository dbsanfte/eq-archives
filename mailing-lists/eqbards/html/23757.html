<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026669079">If it really lowers AC by that much then yes it will be better.  Not only<br/>
will the tanks hit more often, but if they are warriors I believe they will<br/>
get more criticals.  You&#39;d have to duel someone while casting this on<br/>
yourself to be sure and log the results.<br/>

<br/>
I was only using that as an example to show that increases to Agility do not<br/>
provide a one for one increase to AC.  Fully aware that as your stats go up,<br/>
you reach a point of diminishing returns.<br/>
<br/>
BTW my Agility was 99 when I hit myself with the 51 song.  Agility dropped<br/>
to 54.  Total AC loss was either 60 or 65 (16 from the song and the rest due<br/>
to Agility loss).  Based on your previous reply, going below 75 Agility is a<br/>
major penalty to AC.  A mob would have to have an Agility score of 120+ in<br/>
order to avoid going below 75 when hit with the 51 song.  So the question<br/>
then is what kind of Agility score do typical 45+ mobs have?  If the typical<br/>
45+ mob has less than 120 Agility, then the 51 song could have a major<br/>
impact on increasing the amount of melee damage your party does (assuming<br/>
the loss of 50-60 pts of AC is significant).  If the typical 45+ mob has<br/>
more than 120 Agility, then obviously this song won&#39;t decrease their AC by<br/>
50-60 pts.<br/>
<br/>
Next question.  Lets assume you have a snarer and slower in your group and<br/>
as a result don&#39;t need this song for those purposes.  Lets also assume the<br/>
song debuffs the mob&#39;s AC by 50-60 pts.  Would it be better to use this song<br/>
strictly for the AC debuff or instead add in a chant for the extra damage?<br/>
For the AC debuff to outweigh the extra damage from a chant, the AC debuff<br/>
would have to account for around 150 extra melee damage done to the mob over<br/>
three ticks.  Over three ticks, would it be safe to assume that the tanks<br/>
will get in 3-4 extra hits due to the AC debuff and as a result do well over<br/>
150 damage?  If so, think this song will become a permanent fixture to my<br/>
playlist for a while.  <br/>

Saying that 30 agl only added 3 AC is pointless.  How much your agility<br/>
effects AC is dependant on where your Agility starts.  If you have 75<br/>
agility and gain 30 you will gain much more then if you have 150 agility and<br/>
gain 30.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW VoV adds 30 to agility but only base 20 to AC.  When I <br/>
&gt; use this song, my<br/>
&gt; AC actually goes up 22 or 23 pts.  20 for the song and 2 or 3 <br/>
&gt; for the extra<br/>
&gt; 30 agility.  So taken in reverse, the 45 pts of agility lost <br/>
&gt; when hit with<br/>
&gt; the 51 song should not decrease AC by 45 (one for one).  <br/>

&gt; I didn&#39;t think Agility was a one for one exchange for AC.  When I have<br/>
&gt; gotten Agility buffs in the past, I do not recall my AC <br/>
&gt; increasing the same<br/>
&gt; the amount of the Agility buff.  I could be wrong though and <br/>
&gt; if so, that<br/>
&gt; would explain why I lost 60 AC when I hit myself with the 51 song.  <br/>

&gt; The loss of 45 Agility had the secondary effect of lowering <br/>
&gt; your AC by the<br/>
&gt; remainder.  I imagine this was originally tested by <br/>
&gt; encumbering oneself so<br/>
&gt; as to lose 45 pts of agility and observing the resultant drop in AC.<br/>

&gt; I hit myself with this song last night to test it out.  My <br/>
&gt; agility dropped<br/>
&gt; 45 pts like the info below states.  However, my AC dropped <br/>
&gt; over 60 pts, 65<br/>
&gt; IIRC, which is a big difference from 16 as listed below.  <br/>
&gt; Anyone know why<br/>
&gt; there is a disparity between the two numbers?  Does the song work<br/>
&gt; differently against PCs versus NPCs?  In other words, PCs <br/>
&gt; lose 60+ AC while<br/>
&gt; NPCs only lose 16-18 AC.<br/>

&gt; Whats the slow percentage for this song?  It isn&#39;t listed on <br/>
&gt; the EQSongs<br/>
&gt; website.  I assume it is 30% like Chains and Largos but just want to<br/>
&gt; confirm.<br/>
