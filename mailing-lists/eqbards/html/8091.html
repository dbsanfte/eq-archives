<div id="ygrps-yiv-250617992">heh heh, yeah I have been spreading the &#39;bad&#39; word.  One guy in a group was<br/>
begging for Jig last week and I started telling him how it didn&#39;t really<br/>
regen mana and so forth when he blurted out.  &quot;Who cares about the mana,<br/>
this frikkin&#39; sword is heavy and I keep gettin&#39; tired!&quot;  I laughed myself<br/>
right onto the floor.<br/>

If they continue to insist I play the Jig, I tell them that would require me<br/>
to replace one of the eight songs that could actually benefit the group.  If<br/>
they continue to insist I sing Jig, then I will leave the group.  Their<br/>
peace of mind does not outweigh my desire to not die.  Losing a valuable<br/>
song slot to play Jig when I know it has no effect increases my chance of<br/>
dying.  Also, I never tell anyone how to play their character.  Therefore, I<br/>
don&#39;t appreciate it when someone who has never played a bard tells me how to<br/>
play mine.  <br/>
<br/>
With that said, the occasions where I run into people who don&#39;t believe me<br/>
when I tell them the Jig has no effect on mana regen are becoming relatively<br/>
few.  I assume thats because the other bards on E&#39;ci (Faras, Kitasi, Aloro,<br/>
et al) have spread the word and a lot of people are now aware of how the<br/>
song works.  <br/>

&gt; While I know Jig, a song intended for other purposes, does<br/>
&gt; nothing for mana (has been tested and timed) you cannot <br/>
&gt; dump that type of attitude out on your party.  As a bard<br/>
&gt; you are responsible for group coordination through tactics<br/>
&gt; and song, unless an enchanter has that current role in your<br/>
&gt; group.  You also, imo, are there to keep the group solidly<br/>
&gt; happy - with humor/jokes/antics.  If someone in my group <br/>
&gt; asked me to play Jig to speed up their mana (a perceived<br/>
&gt; notion mind you) - I will happily do it.  I&#39;m not trying<br/>
&gt; to mislead them, but if it makes them feel better, most of<br/>
&gt; the time the extra security makes them play sharper.<br/>
