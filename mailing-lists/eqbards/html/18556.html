<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353197346">Charm does indeed wipe the hate list, and you can KS in the manner that he<br/>
described.  Easily.<br/>
<br/>
Experience is awarded by damage done, not position on the hate list, but<br/>
when individuals (not groups) are attacking a mob those positions correspond<br/>
to one another.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are arguably the best powerlevelers in the game for lower levels due<br/>
to this.  Although I don&#39;t do this routinely I have done it for lower level<br/>
guildmates once or twice when I happen across them and have some free time.<br/>
Engage a critter with your lethal ninja-esque bard-melee to smack it down to<br/>
a sliver and then charm it.  When charm wears off it will be fixated on your<br/>
and &quot;swish, swish&quot; try and hit you because the *damage* list has been<br/>
erased, but the *hate* list has not.  Your lower level guy then knocks off<br/>
the sliver and gets the kill and the experience because the damage list has<br/>
be reset by your charm.  I say that we are arguably the best because when<br/>
Enchanters do this same thing with damage/mem wipe combo there are two<br/>
drawbacks for them.  One, they use mana so you have to occassionally take a<br/>
break and let them med.  And two, it&#39;s a lot easier for them to accidentally<br/>
kill a lower level mob with a spell than for a bard will with weapons.<br/>
<br/>
This I have never done, but the way to KS with this song is the same.  The<br/>
theory is that you let a caster nuke a mob down to a sliver, charm it and<br/>
watch the caster cast on it once or twice more before he realizes that it&#39;s<br/>
charmed.  When it breaks charm, you kill it yourself and get the experience<br/>
and loot, because again, the damage list is empty but the hate list is not.<br/>

[50 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;  So there I am, camping the lil Sarnak tower near the Frontier<br/>
&gt; Mtns zone in<br/>
&gt; Ill Omen.  About an hour and a half after I had arrived, I<br/>
&gt; happened to spot<br/>
&gt; this single Sarnak recruit *walking* (the emphasis will be explained in a<br/>
&gt; sec) up to the base of the tower, and heading up the hill.  This<br/>
&gt; was not too<br/>
&gt; terribly long after a Sarnak train had passed by the same spot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Well, there I am, there is this strolling Sarnak... I&#39;m *hunting*<br/>
&gt; Sarnaks... what luck, eh?  As i begin fighitng this lil bit of scrumptious<br/>
&gt; exp, some lugnut named Synd comes up and tells me to pull my own spawns,<br/>
&gt; then turns around and scurried off.<br/>
&gt;     ???<br/>
&gt;     As soon as I got done with the next Sarnak (the one that<br/>
&gt; jumped me after<br/>
&gt; the one I supposedly stole), I told him that the critter was walking,<br/>
&gt; therefore seemed to be un-engaged, and I had no way of knowing that anyone<br/>
&gt; had pulled it.  (If I had known, I certainly wouldn&#39;t have even bothered<br/>
&gt; casting on it, I can find my own stuff to kill :oP )  He then proceeds to<br/>
&gt; curse at me (which I reported... heeheehee) then tossed the big stunner at<br/>
&gt; me: &quot;You are an infamous KSr.&quot;  I thought I was gonna hurt myself<br/>
&gt; laughing!<br/>
&gt; I told him that a bard KS&#39;r was just tooo funnny.  he then began<br/>
&gt; telling me<br/>
&gt; how his roomate has a level 51 bard, and we can use the charm song to KS,<br/>
&gt; and there&#39;s a proc bug, yadda, yadda, yadda, etc, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I guess it didn;t matter that if I hadn;t broken the spawn,<br/>
&gt; he wouldn;t<br/>
&gt; have been able to pull in the first place, or that if his critter wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; acting in an engaged-type manner (actually, it looked like it was just<br/>
&gt; returning from that earlier train), then it&#39;s hardly fair to say that<br/>
&gt; someone &quot;stole&quot; it from you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I told him that the charm, to my knowledge, has never been<br/>
&gt; able to wipe<br/>
&gt; the hate list.  I didn&#39;t bother to remind him that exp awarded isn&#39;t based<br/>
&gt; on hate list anymore, but on damage done.  His arguementative response was<br/>
&gt; something along the lines of &quot;you should know more about the class you<br/>
&gt; play&quot;... Hmmm... can&#39;t be much of a KSr if I don&#39;t know diddly about my<br/>
&gt; class, now can I?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I just thought the rest of you would get a real kick out of<br/>
&gt; knowing that<br/>
&gt; bards (at least in some folks&#39; eyes) are the &quot;best KSrs in the<br/>
&gt; game&quot;.  Class<br/>
&gt; envy, gotta love it.<br/>
