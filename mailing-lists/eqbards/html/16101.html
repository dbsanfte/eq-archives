<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-774292217"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;up till 100 it&#39;s nearly 1 to 1.  After 100 it goes <br/>
&gt;down dramatically.  After about 120 agil it&#39;s like 5 <br/>
&gt;agil to 1 ac<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a significant ac boost when going from 74 to<br/>
75 agility.  Other than that its roughly 4-5 agi per 1<br/>
ac.  There are no known breakpoints other than 75, its<br/>
pretty easy to test with a friendly shaman and a wide<br/>
variety of agi jewellery.  (Different for monks, I<br/>
have not tested with monks and hence, am not sure of<br/>
their formulas.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Whereas straight AC works with your defense bonus.  <br/>
&gt;Not sure the exact calculation but at level 34ish AC <br/>
&gt;multiplier appears to be about 2.5xRAW (Where RAW is <br/>
&gt;the raw AC of the item) .  That&#39;s far from accurate, <br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t done any &#39;testing&#39; yet but that appears to <br/>
&gt;be the case.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The &quot;multiplier&quot; is independant of level.  AC is a<br/>
composite of two factors, &quot;damage avoidance&quot; and<br/>
&quot;damage mitigation&quot;.  Putting on a piece of armor<br/>
gives you some of each and hence you see an AC boost<br/>
of greater than the AC number given on a piece of<br/>
armor.  This multiplier or boost is constant for a<br/>
character and does not change from skills, stats or<br/>
level.  Agi appears to give you damage avoidance only<br/>
and hence you get a minimal effect on your AC for an<br/>
agi raise.<br/>
