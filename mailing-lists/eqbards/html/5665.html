<div id="ygrps-yiv-477583156">LOL no it doesn&#39;t start with a J.  but you seemed to want an opinion from<br/>
someone higher from how i read it, and you just seem stubborn =P<br/>
<br/>
so what i am trying to get across is that i felt exactly the same as you.<br/>
hopefully you will see there is another perspective, and maybe it is better<br/>
and you will learn more you encounter it more often.  i think that&#39;s all we<br/>
are trying to say.<br/>

&gt; &gt;and yes i have gotten my bard past level 23.<br/>

&gt; You need to read the former post I made more carefully,<br/>
&gt; instead of trying to make a comeback so quickly.  Read<br/>
&gt; my message again, and you&#39;ll see your mistake.  Unless<br/>
&gt; your name starts with a J, then I apologize.<br/>
