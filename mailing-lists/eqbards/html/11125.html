<br/>
If you did not get today&#39;s digest - go to the archives and get it (or maybe<br/>
yesterday&#39;s?) whatever - find the post by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:silky@...">silky@...</a><br/>
&lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:silky@...">silky@...</a>&gt;  she has some excellent tips on Lesser fay<br/>
dark.<br/>
<br/>
Now for stats - if you plan to wear bronze plate, you may chose to favor str<br/>
when there is a choice.  But a good base stat to make sure you boost is cha<br/>
- cha helps many mid-level songs. Dex is said to help us start and stop<br/>
songs so dex is good to tweak too. Str will help you with weight as well as<br/>
how hard you hit.  Sta is somewhat ignored but it does add to your hp and<br/>
bards die usually first and maybe a bit of hp might help.  Int is supposed<br/>
to help you learn your skills faster.  We have lots to learn - besides 1hs,<br/>
1hb & piercing, there is singing, percussion, string, brass and wind skills<br/>
to maintain, not mention the standard sense heading, swimming, fishing, etc<br/>
etc.  Most bards are pretty low on wis - hell if we had wisdom, we&#39;d be<br/>
playing another class ;p<br/>
<br/>
Cha, Dex, Str, Agi?, Sta?, Int<br/>
<br/>
Actually, since most all get boosted later in life by magic items and<br/>
jewels, instead of really maxing one out, just tweaking each of them up<br/>
close or closer to 100 should be good so that later on you are not overly<br/>
deficient in any stat.<br/>
<br/>
When you play your instrument and melee attack a mob, you use hand to hand<br/>
skill. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and keep us posted!<br/>

		Hi all, I&#39;m making a bard as a secondary character to my<br/>
cleric.  Just<br/>
		a<br/>
		few basic questions, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re hearing for the 4356th<br/>
time on the<br/>
		list.  Sorry for the clutter... (But to be honest all the<br/>
online guides<br/>
		I found were useless)<br/>
<br/>
		Stats, stats, stats...  To str or not to str... Tis better<br/>
to dex<br/>
		than...<br/>
		In other words, what are your thoughts on starting stats?  I<br/>
was<br/>
		thinking of making a half elf, since I want the better<br/>
vision, and I&#39;ve<br/>
		played a wood elf before...<br/>
<br/>
		What skill is used when you kabong somebody with your lute?<br/>
Hand to<br/>
		hand?  1HB?  I figured it would be worth a practice for all<br/>
those times<br/>
		I attack with an instrument...<br/>
<br/>
		Any other general starting advice?  I won&#39;t be twinking<br/>
myself with my<br/>
		cleric.  (who was started on a new server for me (veeshan)<br/>
to prevent<br/>
		my<br/>
		first character from twinking him) (not a judgment on<br/>
twinkers, I just<br/>
		think it detracts from the fun, to each their own)<br/>
