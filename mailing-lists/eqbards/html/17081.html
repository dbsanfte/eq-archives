<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562424930">Here is a blank sheet of &quot;paper&quot;.  Fill in what *you* think the bard should<br/>
be:<br/>
<br/>
Bard<br/>
----<br/>
Primary: Down-time reduction & over-land travel<br/>
Secondary: Melee + group buffing<br/>
Tertiary: nearly everything else.<br/>
<br/>
Down-time reduction:<br/>
No one, and I mean no one, is better at down time reduction then we are. Ask<br/>
any player in, on any server, what they hate the most about the game and I<br/>
would bet a FBSS and a pair of yaks that downtime would be at the top of the<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Over-land Travel:<br/>
At lower levels group gating every where is just not an option.  We get fast<br/>
travel before any other class in the game.  And at upper levels we can out<br/>
run anything in the game.  Add to this that in the expansion there will be<br/>
zones twice as large as West Karana and that there is only going to be one<br/>
GG point and 2 boat docks on the new continent and this does becomes a<br/>
valuable addition.<br/>
<br/>
Melee:<br/>
We melee better then caster/priest class, but not as well as the other melee<br/>
classes.  Our melee damage output is not trivial, do we pump out the pain<br/>
like a monk? No, not with weapons at least :)<br/>
<br/>
Group Buffing:<br/>
As feeble as our group buffs may seem when compared to the finger-wigglers<br/>
there is something important to remember.  VI has thoughtfully added, and<br/>
keeps adding, mobs that like to AE dispel.  Guess which group is going to do<br/>
better in a case like this?<br/>
<br/>
Nearly everything else:<br/>
We can do nearly everything else any other class can do, with the exception<br/>
of Group Gating and Resurrection.  The ability to dynamically change buffs<br/>
in a few secs is an amazing ability, not to be taken lightly.<br/>
<br/>
Overall:<br/>
I have said this numerous times, so I will say it again :)  The Bard class<br/>
is unique in the fact that we amplify the power of the party.  The large the<br/>
party the more powerful the bard becomes.  No other class and ramp up as<br/>
easily like this.  We can take ANY broken group and make it work.  We can<br/>
take a well-balanced group and turn it into a nearly unstoppable death<br/>
machine.  Playing a Bard is a lot of work, but well worth it IMO.<br/>
