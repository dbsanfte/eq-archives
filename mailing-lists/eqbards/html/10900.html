<div id="ygrps-yiv-336253138"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; by the way, what exactly were you doing with the numbers?  i didn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; take notice before.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The weapon formula that most of us have agreed on and that John<br/>
  has been using.  It works very well, fits all the patterns.<br/>
  The top half is the maximum dmg, the lower half is the swing in secs.<br/>
<br/>
  (DMG * MULTIPLIER + 1) / SPEED<br/>
<br/>
  MULTIPLIER = (LEVEL/10) if LEVEL &lt;= 20 then the MULTIPLIER is always 2.<br/>
  SPEED      = (DELAY/10)<br/>
<br/>
  thus you get this formula to calc dmg/sec:<br/>
<br/>
  (DMG * (LEVEL/10) + 1) / (DELAY/10)<br/>
<br/>
  -------<br/>
<br/>
  A level 5 warrior with a 7/38 axe:  (multiplier is 2, level &lt;= 20)<br/>
<br/>
  (8 * 2 + 1) / (38/10) = 4.47 dmg/sec<br/>
<br/>
  A level 50 warrior with same 7/38 axe:<br/>
<br/>
  (8 * (50/10) + 1) / (38/10) = 10.79 dmg/sec<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These are just maximum&#39;s per sec, averages need number of rounds,<br/>
  dodging, monster parry/block, etc...  But you can assume the same<br/>
  monster will block/parry/riposte you no matter what weapon you are<br/>
  using, so that is a wash.<br/>
<br/>
  Finally maxdmg/sec formula:<br/>
<br/>
  (WEAPON_DMG * (PLAYER_LEVEL/10) + 1) / (WEAPON_DELAY/10)<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
