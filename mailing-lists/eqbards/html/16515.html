Last night we were camping IG&#39;s in front of permafrost.  We had 47 war, 48<br/>
bard, 50 clr, 50 sha, 48 clr, 49 mnk.  Over-kill, I guess.  The druid we<br/>
were sharing the spawn with (play nice ;p) suggested we try the Dark<br/>
Assassin since we heard shouts across the zone about his location.  Since I<br/>
was the only one with tracking, I took off to find him...<br/>
<br/>
Sylly tells the group, &quot;so what is he?&quot;<br/>
Ataras tells the group, &quot;level 50 rogue and lots of hit points&quot;<br/>
Sylly tells the group, &quot;ugh, backstabs&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, I find him and cast chain. He resists and chases me.  I let him get<br/>
close enough for one round and although I missed the scroll, I was down 2+<br/>
bubs in a flash.  I Selos back to the group and got a heal. Then back to<br/>
find him again.  This time I was real carefull to selos pull him. Run -<br/>
look - run - look keeping him well outside of melee but still within agro.<br/>
We took him down in a long fight.  Chain/Fear is what I used and it worked -<br/>
ie very few resists.  He was malosi as well so maybe that helps?  Malosi<br/>
lowers his magic resists?  He dropped a combine dagger and Bloody Dirk:<br/>
Damage 6, Delay 22.  +3 str, +3 dex.  Wt. 1.  Effect of Disease Cloud.<br/>
magic, lore item.  Rogue only.  Heh, combine dagger was rather prophetic<br/>
because that is what happened to it later in the evening - someone clicked<br/>
combine instead of done.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, you are not level 47-50 but here is a tip (for those 35 and up ;p).  I<br/>
used tracking to find him - straight forward enough.  Then used tracking to<br/>
find my group.  I keep tracking on a hot key pallette and open the box and<br/>
just click track.  The first track item is one of your party members and<br/>
pre-selected.  I can get a heading back to my group with an angry mob<br/>
chasing me quickly and easily.<br/>

&gt; Chains for pulling?  Depends on the situation.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From my days in Sol A, we<br/>
&gt; learned quickly that you don&#39;t want to be SoW&#39;ed when pulling and you WANT<br/>
&gt; that mob stuck on your back... </span></blockquote></div>
