&gt;    The 3 different types of dmg shields are the Coat Series (Druid/Ranger<br/>

&gt; Psalm of Warmth & Cooling fall into the 3rd set and wont stack with others<br/>
&gt; of that type.  The three types are meant to stack though, and if it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; working currently it is a bug.  I do know Warmth stacks fine with SoT<br/>
&gt; though, as last night I was getting 13&#39;s of the hits (9 from SoT, 4 from<br/>
&gt; PoW).<br/>

when I played PoW I was only seeing the &quot;pierced by thorns&quot;<br/>
message, no &quot;burned&quot; message when the mob attacked them.  <br/>
I&#39;ll have to ask them next time it happens.<br/>
