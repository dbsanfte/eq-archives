<div id="ygrps-yiv-345436323">I am in need of a new weapon to replace my aging combine longsword and 2 choices<br/>
that come to mind are a Barbed Whip or a Polished Granite Tomahawk. Both of<br/>
these weapons have plusses and minusses and I was wondering if anyone here had<br/>
an opinion of which, if either, is better and why. Or if you know of any other<br/>
weapons that can be bought (I hate camping) for around 100-200pp feel free to<br/>
expound on their virtues as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

P.S. A piercing weapon would work too. I already use a Dragoon Dirk as my<br/>
secondary weapon.</div>
