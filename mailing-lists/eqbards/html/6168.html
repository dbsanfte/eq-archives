<div id="ygrps-yiv-572759854">Here&#39;s an interesting one for you.  I have a very good paladin friend that I<br/>
duel with all the time.  Its a great way to try out new tactics.  Ever since<br/>
she got her greater heal (level 39) she&#39;s been trouncing me quite<br/>
regularily.<br/>
Yesterday, just for fun, I said &quot;okay, I&#39;m going to fight you without my<br/>
weapons&quot;.  She was a little confused, but a agreed.  Twisting Hymn, DDD, and<br/>
Chords with a lute equipped got her down to 15 HPs before we called it off.<br/>
I had about a bubble left.  Not bad considering when I fought her with my<br/>
weapons she wasn&#39;t even down to half life when I was running for the zone.<br/>
For reference, I fight either with a staff of writhing and a silvery axe, or<br/>
a silver axe/dirk combo.<br/>
