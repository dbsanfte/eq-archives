Well you don&#39;t know me but I&#39;m new so you shouldn&#39;t know me.  I&#39;ll give<br/>
out a few MM pointers I have learned with my druid :)  My secondary is a<br/>
bard so I figure I could have some say here every now and then :)<br/>
<br/>
The maid and butler area can easily be soloed at your level, well I&#39;m not<br/>
sure my bard isn&#39;t nearly as high as you or my druid (at 49th).  There&#39;s a<br/>
ton of tricks on how to get past areas even without an invis or<br/>
camo.  Also there&#39;s a few more tricks on pulling one mob out of a room so<br/>
you can easily split the spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Over the last week I have gone back to mistmoore to help out my guild and<br/>
decided to get a few things for my bard while i was there.  I&#39;ve gotten a<br/>
few drums, lutes and wreaths (still trying for the damn diamodine<br/>
earring?).  I&#39;m assuming you know where the maid and butler spawn, so I&#39;ll<br/>
just give you tips on controling those two rooms and the hall between<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
HOw ever you decide to get into Mistmoore, run throught he Gypsy (&quot;ball<br/>
room&quot;) room through the double doors on the other side.   Continue running<br/>
straight until you are past the kitchen.  If you are past the door when<br/>
you attack the first npc straight ahead nothing will come out of the rooms<br/>
to assist it.  Pull the mob how ever you wish, but don&#39;t pull by walking<br/>
over to slap it with a weapon, you&#39;ll get the closest mob in the hall way<br/>
to your right leading to the maid&#39;s room.<br/>
<br/>
Kill it quickly, and i&#39;m sure i don&#39;t have to say this but I will, CHAIN<br/>
them as they start running.  The cooks will try to heal what ever you are<br/>
fighting, but it is a low level necro spell so it shouldn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Next I suggest grabbing the first mob in the hall to your right.  Kill the<br/>
same as the one before.  There should be one more at the end of the hall<br/>
way.  Pull and kill where you killed the previous two.  Now the halls are<br/>
clear and you shouldn&#39;t get anything but singles from the room.  Here&#39;s<br/>
the tricks to pulling the gargs and the maid/butler/place holders by<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
At 50 we can easily do this by hiding around the corners of the doors.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t take much to figure out where to stand when you pull.  for the<br/>
butler room, this is the one straight from the kitchen, not down the hall<br/>
to the right.<br/>
<br/>
Stand to the left of the door, open it and target the butler/place holder,<br/>
pull, kill.  Next do not clear out the gargoyle in there.  Go to the<br/>
maid&#39;s room, stand to the left of the door, open and pull the garg from<br/>
that room, kill and go back to butler room.  Kill the garg, go back to<br/>
maid&#39;s room and kill the maid/place holder.  If you keep on top of the<br/>
spawning You should have the entire area spawning with your down time.<br/>
<br/>
If things are slow on the spanwing just run back down  the hall you came<br/>
from and kill the gypsies.  Just open the door  and do not run past<br/>
it.  target a gypsy and kill a bit back, pull to the maid area if you wish<br/>
but DO not fight in the big open area that leads to the dark elf noble<br/>
area, you&#39;ll get that room and four gargs if you decide to fight there.<br/>
<br/>
At night you should get werewolves to spawn, I love fighting those giant<br/>
wet rats :)  Getting the maid and butler to drop fangs is just as bad as<br/>
pulling teeth (pun intended).  They only drop them SOMETIMES in were wolf<br/>
form only.  So if you kill them durring the day you&#39;ll just get a wreath<br/>
or cloak (which is really a neck piece).  Both are pretty good, the cloak<br/>
especially for nafagen raids for the extra +7 MR it gives.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to mistmoore i&#39;m the only person in there, it&#39;s really great to<br/>
have the entire place to yourself, don&#39;t have to worry about getting<br/>
others killed if you have to run to the zone (haven&#39;t had to yet).  Also<br/>
there will be plenty of younger bards wanting  to get a lute for their<br/>
lambent breast plate, I&#39;ve helped out quite a few when they show up,<br/>
always nice to help people when needed. :)<br/>
<br/>
If anybody on Cazic wants to help me in my little mistmoore runs, or just<br/>
learn how it&#39;s done just give me a tell.  The catch is i work graves so I<br/>
play from 8am until noon ;)<br/>

:I think the time has come that I pick up an ebw.  I&#39;ve got a ykesha for my<br/>

:the maid and butler rooms, but I&#39;m not really very familiar with spawns and<br/>
:aggro radius&#39; in there, I was just wondering if anyone can offer any<br/>
advice.<br/>
:Where is the best/safest place to camp?  Can I do it solo, or should I<br/>
bring<br/>

:fangs?<br/>
:Any advice would be helpful.<br/>
