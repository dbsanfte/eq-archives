<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334854769">I&#39;ve always been waiting for someone at Verant to claim that the<br/>
autotargetting effect of our songs was the real reason for Bard hate.   <br/>
<br/>
VIEmployee:  &quot;Well, you see the code has the mob clear his target, then it<br/>
has the target set to be whatever is highest on the hate list.  But, if your<br/>
song pulses on him while his target is cleared, the target gets set to you<br/>
and then the repopulation of the target from the top of the hate list fails,<br/>
so the mob attacks you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
RndBard: &quot;Doesn&#39;t that mean it&#39;s a bug?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
VIEmployee:  &quot;Well, we&#39;re not sure.  We think it&#39;s working as intended, but<br/>
we can look into it later if necessary, it&#39;s just not a high priority right<br/>
now.&quot;<br/>

I know a few people who include emotes in their assist keys.  Heres the<br/>
problem, if the assist fails (IE talk isn&#39;t hitting anything) they usally<br/>
end up emoting ME since if there target was blank, it has probably switched<br/>
to me when my song pulsed.<br/>
<br/>
So I get all these horrible emotes done to me :(<br/>
