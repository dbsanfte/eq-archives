<b>Subject:</b> Question about crafted weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-496657269">Wood elven blacksmiths can craft Mithril Fier&#39;dal weapons.  These items are<br/>
deity items linked to Tunare.  My bard is a wood elf but I chose Bristlebane<br/>
since I figured the god of rogues was more fitting for a bard than Tunare.<br/>
So does that mean I can not equip these weapons since I don&#39;t worship<br/>
Tunare?  And if I can&#39;t equip weapons crafted by wood elves, could I equip<br/>
deity weapons crafted by halflings who worship Bristlebane?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
