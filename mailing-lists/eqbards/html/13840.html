<div id="ygrps-yiv-645414958">The only cove I can think of offhand in LR is pretty easy to find.  <br/>
Go to the mountains zoneline, go straight off the dock into the <br/>
water.  Under the tower island is a cave.  I don&#39;t know if that is <br/>
the main residence of the DW gobs, or of that is just where the ice <br/>
comet quest items pops, but it is a cave.  And I have seen DW gob <br/>
pets come out of it.  So take it as you will =)<br/>
