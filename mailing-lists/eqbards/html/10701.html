<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826841173">I have to think that singing the Mana song in battle is not worth it.  <br/>
Figuring that you can twist three songs for the price of one Mana Song, <br/>
and that the Mana Song buys you an additional one-third of a spell for <br/>
each caster, the breakeven point should be at nine or more casters in <br/>
your party, which means never.  And that assumes that they are all OOM.<br/>
<br/>
If I have to pick one song to sing, it&#39;s probably Lullaby (which <br/>
impressed the heck out of a bunch of level 42-50s in Lower Guk the other <br/>
night - I was level 34 at the time).  I sing the Mana Song when we&#39;re <br/>
done.<br/>
