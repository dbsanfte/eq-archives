&gt; Earlier this week there was a thread discussing how Pixie Strike was broken.<br/>
&gt; In one of the posts, someone also mentioned that Lullaby didn&#39;t seem to work<br/>
&gt; as well either.  Last night in Unrest I had a first hand experience that<br/>

&gt; unintentionally broken.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it was nerfed.  I think they just botched a<br/>
change to the internals of how it works.  If you use Pixie<br/>
Strike on yourself, one of three things happens.<br/>
<br/>
1) You resist it.  Nothing exciting there.<br/>
<br/>
2) It works (it really works).  You get the &quot;You are stunned&quot;<br/>
message, the hand icon shows up, and you are stunned.  When<br/>
the effect wears off, the hand icon disappears, you can move<br/>
again, and you get the &quot;You are unstunned&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
3) It works (but does nothing).  The hand icon shows up but<br/>
nothing else happens.  When the hand icon disappears, you get<br/>
the &quot;You are no longer stunned&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
Note the difference in wording.  That indicates to me that two<br/>
different subroutines are being called in case (2) and (3).  <br/>
For argument&#39;s sake, let&#39;s call (3) the &quot;old&quot; function and (2)<br/>
the &quot;new&quot; function.<br/>
<br/>
I think the original Pixie Strike (and likely Lullaby) called<br/>
the old function.  About a month ago, Verant for some reason<br/>
decided to change the code governing this and wrote up the new<br/>
function.  For good measure, they disabled the part of the old<br/>
function that was causing the problems (mainly the part that<br/>
does the stunning).  But somewhere, somehow, this old function<br/>
is still being called, especially when fighting high-blue or<br/>
higher mobs, leading to the song not being resisted but having<br/>
no effect.  Nobody caught this in testing because both<br/>
functions still generated the same &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; message,<br/>
which was assumed to be coming from the new function.<br/>
<br/>
To find out if the same thing is happening with Lullaby,<br/>
you&#39;ll have to go to the Arena and test it on a volunteer<br/>
(about the same level as the bard to maximize the incidence of<br/>
this bug).  That person should understand the above problem<br/>
and the two different messages, and watch for them with the<br/>
Lullaby song.</div>
