<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139375021">Hmm, can&#39;t say what level they are but they were blue to me at 39. (Probably<br/>
32 to 35?)  I was just  there Christmas Eve in a group with<br/>
mid-to-upper-30&#39;s and maybe a 40.  We cleared all the bats and bugs and<br/>
frogs. I read here that a bard used lament and could pull less than the<br/>
whole room - so I asked the group if they were up for trying it.  And they<br/>
said sure.<br/>
<br/>
I carefully moved around lamenting them all and then tried to pull the one<br/>
closest to the door.  It happened pretty fast but I think one from the rear<br/>
pulled but 3 of the 5 stayed in the room.  We killed the 2 pretty easily.<br/>
And then pulled the rest of the room.<br/>
<br/>
We did this 3 times.  The 3rd time I went to lament the first one and lament<br/>
was resisted, he agro&#39;d and the whole room pulled.  That was not good.  I<br/>
did not have Lullaby memmed as I was using Pixie but the situation was<br/>
totally out of control.  I gave a shout for &quot;help in the bedroom&quot; and<br/>
instantly a lev 50 enchanter and lev 50 wiz popped in and the enchanter<br/>
fired off AE mez and all the skellys went to sleep.  Well, all except the<br/>
one the tanks were beating on. Thank the Gods they were /assisting!!!  The<br/>
hi lev&#39;s saved our butts.<br/>
<br/>
Could you have taken them?  I would have to say no - maybe you could handle<br/>
a single - but you don&#39;t get singles easily. And then if you get a room<br/>
spawn, you have real trouble.  They are nasty casters and can burn you down<br/>
very very fast.  Especially if you get more than one.  If you get the whole<br/>
room - it&#39;s a disaster - even for a mid to upper 30&#39;s group.  <br/>
<br/>
I have seen 2 groups - like 8 or so mid 30&#39;s move past them - agro the room<br/>
and then proceed to kill them all without too much difficulty.  But trying<br/>
to pull them in singles - is risky.  At lo 30&#39;s, fighting 5 red cons at the<br/>
same time is simply too much.  I would be surprised if your party could all<br/>
make the zone if you had to run - and not sure the druid would have been<br/>
able to evac if she was getting burned by the skells.  <br/>

bones, all<br/>
		conned red to me at level 30 so I didn&#39;t risk pulling them.<br/>
My group was<br/>
