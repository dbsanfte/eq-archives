<div id="ygrps-yiv-223792406">I have managed to acquire a near-epic item that I cannot use, thanks to an <br/>
incredibly random quest (details below).  A friend of mine with a <br/>
near-uber-guild has offered to trade me &quot;whatever I want&quot; for it, so I&#39;m <br/>
trying to come up with stuff that doesn&#39;t require me to go to the Planes, <br/>
or them to kill a dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

Did the scrap metal quest in Akanon, and recieved The Horn of Hsagra - 13 / <br/>
20 piercing, WAR, SHD, ROG, RNG, +35 AC +75 HP and some other assorted <br/>
stats.  Looked like a rat tooth, so I almost trashed it!!!</div>
