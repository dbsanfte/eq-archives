people lower level than me and we&#39;re fighting stuff that&#39;s<br/>

really seems to help them hit more often and harder.<br/>
Otherwise I prefer Chain.  If we&#39;re in a multi-mob situation,<br/>
I&#39;d rather use Lullaby or Strike than this song anyway.<br/>

&gt;       I&#39;ve chained and they can&#39;t snare, or when my chains break their<br/>
&gt;       snare, so I&#39;m thinking of reviving this one.  As for the attack<br/>
&gt;       speed and AC adjustments, I&#39;ve never noticed any tangible<br/>
&gt;       benefits.  Currently never memorized.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bah - as long as you keep it Chained, why should they<br/>
complain?  Chain is superior to snare because it slows down<br/>
attack speed.  It&#39;s also a pretty good taunt, and ask any<br/>
healer - they&#39;d rather the bard in banded/plate be taking<br/>
damage, not the druid in leather.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 22 -- Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody.  As far as I can tell, this<br/>
&gt;       doesn&#39;t do squat.  Never memorized.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone on the www.harpers.net/bard message board claimed it<br/>
does reduce the duration of DoTs.  I dunno, and at this point<br/>
I don&#39;t think I really care anymore.  If figuring out what<br/>
this song does is this tough, then whatever it does can&#39;t be<br/>
dramatic enough to warrant me keeping it memorized.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 23 -- Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain.  Great &quot;taunt&quot; and as a bonus, it can be<br/>
&gt;       used to snare runners if you don&#39;t have a snare caster in the<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s better than relying on casters to snare/root because you<br/>
can chase mobs while singing this song - they can&#39;t while<br/>
casting snare/root.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;       party (or on the mob).  The attack speed slow-down is<br/>
&gt;       noticeable, and when combined with enchanter debuffs is truly<br/>
&gt;       remarkable.  It quickly superseded Largo&#39;s in my collection once<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you sure it stacked?  I&#39;ve been meaning to test it but<br/>
haven&#39;t gotten around to it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 24 -- Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord.  Um.  Why is this such a high-level<br/>
&gt;       song?  As a wood-elf, I don&#39;t care about ultravision.  If I were<br/>
&gt;       human, I&#39;d have long ago come up with a decent light source.<br/>
&gt;       I&#39;ve never checked to see if I can really see invisible with<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it does let you see invisible.  Very useful for picking<br/>
out invisible kill stealers waiting beside you.  And since<br/>
it&#39;s party effect, you don&#39;t have to explain to your group<br/>
what you&#39;re seeing - they can see for themsleves.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful with this song though - the range is as great as<br/>
Accelerando.  A druid friend was getting back to us in<br/>
Permafrost while invisible, and I sang this song so we would<br/>
be able to see her.  She moved into the song&#39;s range well<br/>
before reaching us, the song ticked which blew her<br/>
invisibility, the mobs attacked, and she had to zone again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 25 -- Psalm of Warmth.  Woohoo!  Although new people are always asking<br/>
&gt;       me, &quot;Do you really think we need cold protection,&quot; everyone<br/>
&gt;       loves the damage shield.  Even those druids who already get a 15<br/>
&gt;       point personal shield are impressed by the 5 point addition.  I<br/>
&gt;       always have this memorized, and I am almost always singing it in<br/>
&gt;       battle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was upgraded recently.  When I got it at 25, it was only<br/>
a 4 point shield, 5 points at 29, then 6 points at 30.  So<br/>
about the time I reached level 29, Verant changed this to<br/>
start at 5 points damage at L25.  It&#39;s a very nice song if<br/>
you&#39;re in a small group, but not as important when you&#39;re in a<br/>
big one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 26 -- Angstlich&#39;s Appalling Screech.  In the wrong place at the wrong<br/>
&gt;       time, this can be a disaster.  However, I have used it<br/>
&gt;       effectively a few times as a panic button, giving my party (or<br/>
&gt;       what remained of it) time to zone.  I guess it could also be<br/>
&gt;       used for reverse-kiting in safer areas, but I&#39;ve never tried<br/>
&gt;       that.  Because of its limited usefulness, I rarely have it<br/>
&gt;       memorized, unless I strongly suspect a pending disaster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I vastly underestimated this song, and relegated it to<br/>
practicing brass skill.  Then while we were in the depths of<br/>
Guk, I happened to have it memorized when we got in over our<br/>
heads. My friends all ran out of the song&#39;s range and died<br/>
within 30 seconds.  I made it from the Lord room to the zone<br/>
(a 1-2 minute run) losing only 2 bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
Later, after I recovered their corpses and they&#39;d been<br/>
resurrected and were sitting out the resurrection effects at<br/>
the zone, someone dumped a train on us.  So I fired up Screech<br/>
again, and I&#39;ll be damned it worked.  The cleric had to heal<br/>
me once in the 2+ minutes we sat there waiting for the others<br/>
to finish looting and regain enough strength to move, but we<br/>
went from a really bad situation to a yawner with the cleric<br/>
&quot;practicing&quot; some little-used spells on the fleeing frogs to<br/>
kill time.<br/>
<br/>
I think we will change our dungeon retreat strategy to me<br/>
firing up this song, and everyone sticking close to me as we<br/>
*slowly* make our way to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also good for Chain/Fear attacks (snare/Fear is probably<br/>
better as then there&#39;s less chance of the Fear effect wearing<br/>
off due to resists).  This will significant cut down the<br/>
damage you take when fighting ultra-powerful melee mobs<br/>
(griffins, giants, cyclopses, etc).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 27 -- Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens.  I was really looking forward to<br/>
&gt;       this, but once I got it, I was terribly disappointed.  It seems<br/>
&gt;       that by the time I can type &quot;/pet sit down,&quot; the charm is nearly<br/>
&gt;       expired.  Does this last longer as my level goes up?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Silly - you don&#39;t type the commands, you convert some of your<br/>
socials buttons to hold the commands which you then hotkey.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  And can I<br/>
&gt;       really charm multiple mobs at once, as described in an earlier<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you&#39;re only allowed one pet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 28 -- Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike.  If this cleared the mob&#39;s shit-list,<br/>
&gt;       it would be fantastic.  As it is, I find it disappointing.  It<br/>
&gt;       is certainly no substitute for the enchanter&#39;s mesmerize.  If I<br/>
&gt;       can really charm multiple mobs at once, then I see no real<br/>
&gt;       advantage to mesmerizing, but if charm is limited to one at a<br/>
&gt;       time, then I guess mesmerize could be useful as an alternative<br/>
&gt;       to lullaby.  Still, it seems that when mesmerizing two or three<br/>
&gt;       mobs, I&#39;d have to pull out of the fighting completely, whereas<br/>
&gt;       with lullaby I can still be in there bashing on the same guy the<br/>
&gt;       party is attacking.  Not currently memorized, but maybe I need<br/>
&gt;       to experiment with this more.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My experience has been that mobs break out of Lullaby more<br/>
often and more quickly than with Strike.  Also, I dunno what<br/>
weapons you use or who you usually group with, but each of the<br/>
folks I&#39;m grouped with typically do twice as much damage as me<br/>
in a fight, and there are usually two or three of them.  So<br/>
it&#39;s not a problem for me to drop out of a fight and stick to<br/>
just my instruments while striking two or three mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing it does is interrupt casters, which is great in<br/>
certain areas since it&#39;s not area effect like Lullaby.  If<br/>
we&#39;re fighting something like a lizard herald or justicar, I<br/>
will just strike it over and over instead of singing any other<br/>
songs.  Between me and the paladins casting stun, solo casting<br/>
mobs usually get off 0-1 spells during a fight.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 29 -- Psalm of Vitality.  Um.  Okay, great disease resistance.  (No<br/>
&gt;       poison resistance at all, despite what I&#39;ve seen on some of the<br/>
&gt;       song listings.)  Big whoop.  Am I going to be fighting anything<br/>
&gt;       where people are going to care about this?  The last time I<br/>
&gt;       fought anything with disease, it was the undead gnolls in Lake<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has a pretty nice AC bonus (same as Chant of Battle with a<br/>
drum), but then so does Psalm of Warmth, and that has a damage<br/>
shield to boot, so yeah, pretty useless.  Maybe if diseases<br/>
really meant something, like they added lycanthropy, then this<br/>
song would be useful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;d appreciate any observations that run counter to my own analysis,<br/>
&gt; plus some insight on what&#39;s coming up for me in the 30&#39;s.  Do any of<br/>
&gt; these new songs really rock?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Clarity (L32) is probably the most anti-climactic song you<br/>
will ever get.  Everyone wants it, you can&#39;t wait for it, and<br/>
when you finally do get it... nothing.  You cannot see<br/>
*anything* this song does because it does not affect you in<br/>
the slightest (except the annoying spam messages).  All you<br/>
get are reassurances from anyone who&#39;s not a bard, monk,<br/>
warrior, or rogue, that yes, their mana is indeed regenerating<br/>
faster.  More like a whimper than a bang.  :-)<br/>
