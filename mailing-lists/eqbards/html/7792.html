<div id="ygrps-yiv-554220042">Need some technical help so posting this message in the hope there are some<br/>
hardware/software gurus on the list.<br/>
<br/>
I have started to experience frequent Blue Screens of Death (BSOD) on my<br/>
system.  This doesn&#39;t happen while I am playing EQ but will occur sometimes<br/>
after I log out and return to the desktop.  Another wierd event that<br/>
sometimes occurs when I log out from EQ is that the Windows desktop gets<br/>
shrunk by about 25%.  When this happens, the taskbar along the bottom (where<br/>
the Start button and TSR icons are) moves up about a 1/4 of the screen<br/>
(about three inches).  The right side of the desktop also gets cropped by<br/>
about four inches.  Any icons that were in the areas that got cropped<br/>
disappear from the screen.  I have to reboot when this happens.  I also get<br/>
the BSOD when running regular programs like my web browser (Netscape) and<br/>
Office 97 programs.    <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that is wierd is that my Norton SystemWorks program<br/>
continually tells me my system resources are low.  I don&#39;t know why this is<br/>
occuring because I have 128MB of RAM and relatively few TSRs running.  When<br/>
I play EQ, the only TSRs running are my SBLive and Norton SystemWorks.  I<br/>
still get the &quot;user resources low&quot; message even when I disable Norton.  This<br/>
problem only started occuring after I added 64MB of additional RAM.  The RAM<br/>
is working, evidence being that my zone times since I added the RAM have<br/>
decreased rapidly.  This one really puzzles me.     <br/>
<br/>
Prior to Windows 95, I got pretty good at tweaking my autoexec.bat and<br/>
config.sys files to maximize my RAM.  That came from trying to play all the<br/>
Ultima games from Origin, the ultimate memory hogs.  However, with Win 95, I<br/>
have never tried messing with the Windows registry for fear of screwing<br/>
things up beyond my ability to fix.  <br/>
<br/>
With that said, I think that the problems I am having have something to do<br/>
with a corrupt registry.  Would like to get some advice on possible fixes<br/>
for this.  I was considering reinstalling Win 95 but wasn&#39;t sure if this<br/>
would replace the registry with a clean version.  I guess another<br/>
possibility would be to install Windows 98.  Likewise, not certain if this<br/>
would replace the registry with a clean version.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have an idea, other than a corrupt registry, of what might be<br/>
causing these problems?  I have an updated virus program and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
detect anything so that shouldn&#39;t be an issue.  Hard drive is optimized so<br/>
thats not an issue either.  Norton SystemWorks says everything is fine.  Is<br/>
there some other test that I can run to diagnose my computer to see whats<br/>
wrong?    <br/>
<br/>
Here are my system specs:<br/>
<br/>
Gateway 300mhz PII<br/>
128 MB RAM<br/>
SBLive soundcard<br/>
Riva TNT video card (16MB AGP)<br/>
Hard drive has 1.5 GB of free space<br/>
<br/>
Please send any responses directly to my email address.  No need to add<br/>
additional unnecessary posts to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
