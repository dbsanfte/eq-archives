<br/>
They are by far the best friends of all Fear/snare capable classes.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly, most newbies are scared that the rogue&#39;s are stealing all thier copper that they cannot see<br/>
them for the tanks/damage dealers they are. The Pickpocket skill is so misunderstood it is not even funny.<br/>

&gt; The only legitimate reason I can think of is if they aleady have enough<br/>
&gt; tanks and need a healer or a nuker to balance out the group.  I have have<br/>
&gt; tremendous success the past few weeks grouping with rogues in Kunark.  With<br/>
&gt; just me and a rogue we can chain/fear or instill doubt/backstab mobs left<br/>
&gt; and right.  Most recent example was in the Overthere zone.  There was a<br/>
&gt; party of four pulling to the FM zone.  I was already grouped with a rogue<br/>
&gt; and we asked to join the party.  They were willing to add me but not the<br/>
&gt; rogue.  I told them either both of us or none of us.  They decided against<br/>
&gt; adding us both.  We showed them up by using chains/fear/backstab right there<br/>
&gt; next to them.  We pulled and killed just as many mobs as they did.  Since we<br/>
&gt; had little downtime, theres a good chance we killed more mobs than they did.<br/>
&gt; And since there was just two of us, I think its safe to say we ended up<br/>
&gt; getting more EXP than they did.  Anytime a group I&#39;m in refuses to add a<br/>
&gt; rogue, I&#39;ll drop from the group and join him myself.<br/>

&gt; Would you really rather have not had an entire evening of awesome grouping<br/>
&gt; so that you wouldn&#39;t lose a little experience?  Treasure your lower levels<br/>
&gt; while you still can.  As my level 48 rogue, I often just sit waiting for a<br/>
&gt; group for hours on end (not kidding here, longest I&#39;ve ever waited was 4<br/>
&gt; hours).  If I could stay level 48 for the rest of my EQ carreer, but have a<br/>
&gt; lot of fun and always be grouped in the process, I would give up exp in a<br/>
&gt; heartbeat.<br/>
