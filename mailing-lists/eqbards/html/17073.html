<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945278109">I have tried that.  The problem is the bard&#39;s major weakness is a lack of<br/>
strengths.  diversity is handy, but it does not make up for being far weaker<br/>
in just about every category.<br/>

I still believe that all classes are powerful at different levels.  You say<br/>
you retired your shaman at level 12.  Yup, those were bad levels.  Also the<br/>
late 20s sucked bad.  By level 34 though, you get your pet, your slowdown<br/>
buffs and HP buffs ... wow.  I would say a shaman at 50 is one of the MOST<br/>
powerful classes.    <br/>
<br/>
And I would say the same of Bards.  Try doing a dragon raid without bards...<br/>
try fear or hate without bards... sure you can do it but wow, they make SUCH<br/>
a difference.  By level 50, they are incredibly powerful.  And well, then<br/>
there is the whole run fast thing :)<br/>
<br/>
I think the trick to playing any class in EQ is sticking with it through the<br/>
&quot;rough times&quot; and to try to emphasize your strengths not worry about the<br/>
class weaknesses.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree that we&#39;re weak in a lot of areas.  But then,<br/>
I retired my 12th lvl Shaman because I think that&#39;s an<br/>
underpowered class.  <br/>
<br/>
So why do any of us play a bard?  I&#39;d say, because<br/>
it&#39;s fun to outrun that train of orc oracles at 5th<br/>
lvl, because there&#39;s nothing cooler than starting to<br/>
heal that 6th lvl group on orc hill and have people<br/>
say: &quot;Wow!  Sweet!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about going to the beholder room and being the<br/>
charm-proofer. <br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s about passing high lvl druids in the Karanas<br/>
like they&#39;re standing still.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about dynamic buffing -- when we buff, nobody is<br/>
left out.  We can change buffs in the middle of the<br/>
fight, we are the stick shift characters of this game.<br/>
 Everybody else&#39;s spells are what the military calls<br/>
&quot;fire and forget&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tough to be a good bard...and I play for the<br/>
challenge and roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
But underpowered?  YES, YES, YES.  They really need to<br/>
make us a bit tougher.<br/>
