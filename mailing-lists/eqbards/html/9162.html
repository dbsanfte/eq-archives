<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823944320">Aye, I had the exact same problem last night, and I&#39;m<br/>
sure it&#39;s due to lag. Much like when running across<br/>
the karanas, and I suddenly see &quot;You slow down&quot;. I<br/>
look, my butons are all grayed, but I have no Selo&#39;s<br/>
icon. Then I notice my lag... After I log back on,<br/>
(got lagged out), I&#39;m fine. It seems there needs to be<br/>
uninterrupted client-communication for songs to work.<br/>
Too much PL and you freeze. No songs playing, stopping<br/>
or starting. <br/>

Subject: Song probs?<br/>
<br/>
   i&#39;m glad to see it&#39;s not just me having this exact<br/>
problem...<br/>
<br/>
   yesterday alone i encountered two separate<br/>
occasions when i could<br/>
not <br/>
sing a song due to another song being what appeared to<br/>
be &quot;locked&quot; into<br/>
<br/>
verse. now the peculiar thing was that one of these<br/>
times, i was in<br/>
east <br/>
commons grouped with another bard, and some others. i<br/>
decided since i<br/>
was a <br/>
little higher than he was, to sing my hymn song<br/>
instead to heal up the<br/>
party <br/>
a wee faster. his song ended. i attempted to start my<br/>
hymn. did not<br/>
take... <br/>
at all. i tried maybe 20 times. grrr... this wasn&#39;t<br/>
the first time it<br/>
had <br/>
happened to me, so i didn&#39;t panic. i simply zoned. it<br/>
seems to fix the <br/>
problem, but isn&#39;t necessarily something you want to<br/>
do while either <br/>
fighting some mobs, or trying to heal your party while<br/>
preparing for<br/>
the <br/>
next battle.<br/>
   even while i was running towards the zone, i asked<br/>
the other bard to<br/>
sto <br/>
singing his song again. he did once more. i was maybe<br/>
half the zone<br/>
away <br/>
from him and still kept getting the message &quot;your<br/>
wounds begin to<br/>
heal.&quot; <br/>
hmmm... i left clicked on the icon to try removing the<br/>
effects that<br/>
way. <br/>
also no luck. well since i was at the zone, i went<br/>
ahead and did the<br/>
sure <br/>
fix.<br/>
   is this happening with any other bards? what could<br/>
be the problem?<br/>
maybe <br/>
an incidental bug included with the last patch. or is<br/>
what Sylly was <br/>
discussing having to do with lag and spikes? i didn&#39;t<br/>
experience any of<br/>
that <br/>
if i recall correctly.<br/>
