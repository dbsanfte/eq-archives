<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099999590">Heh,<br/>
<br/>
Well, me and my friend who has a 46 Clr decide to play our low level chars:<br/>
me CLR (8) and him MNK (9) and visit BlackBurrow Paw.  Actually he had found<br/>
a BRD (7) and was there already so I came to join up.  We putzed around for<br/>
a while killing various things and generally avoiding trains.  I tried not<br/>
to be a &#39;know it all&quot; and tell the bard how to play his char but soon enough<br/>
I broke down.  He is a good bard and knew his stuff but was a first time<br/>
player although I think he mentioned a low level sha or druid he has/had<br/>
too.  Well, his bard was in banded or chain and he was using a giant snake<br/>
fang for his wep. Smart guy!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How come you don&#39;t use a lute when you play Hymn?&quot;  &quot;Uhm, we don&#39;t get<br/>
string skill til level 8.&quot; Doh! (Been a while - sheesh.)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, enough of this. So I park my cleric and go get Sylly.  She gives this<br/>
guy a Dragoon Dirk.  See how that works, heh.  And they sit by the door to<br/>
the upper ramp near the waterfall pool.  Sylly busys herself running<br/>
upstairs and pulling elites and guards and the odd commander.  Damn cant<br/>
rememeber where the green room is - heh.  Finally, they both ding a level<br/>
and as we are trying to get out and go up top someone pulls a pretty good<br/>
train to the &#39;berm&#39; next to the dry bridge. They are both hurt and we are<br/>
not grouped so I play Fear to give them a chance to escape the train.  Well,<br/>
that kinda works - the Monk escapes but the Bard dies.  And then Sylly is<br/>
looking at the biggest train she has ever seen.  Geez, that is *alot* of<br/>
gnolls!  Well, since the 4 at a time that are beating on her cant do any<br/>
damage, she decides to kill them all.  Nope, Dirge was not memmed.  She<br/>
melees them all.  Took a good 6 or 7 minutes to chop them all down.<br/>
<br/>
By then the bard has run back from Qeynos and we recover his stuff and pull<br/>
a few more for him to re-ding.  Hoo rah!  Let&#39;s head out - we need to go to<br/>
Kelethin and buy your new song.  And heh, my Wizard is waiting upstairs to<br/>
fly us there!  So, we hit  Gfay and run up to Kelethin.  Of course, we need<br/>
to hire a local wood elf to lead us to the bard guild (48 levels and I still<br/>
dont know and *hate* Kelethin!)  I buy him his Lament and the next two<br/>
Kelethin songs and give him a lambent stone.  And then we fly back to North<br/>
Karana (ok, my wiz is only level 29 but it sure beats the boat!  And yes, I<br/>
have 2 PC&#39;s so my wiz can fly Sylly anywhere she wants top go - as long as<br/>
its Gfay, NK or Tox.)<br/>
<br/>
So, hehe, things definately are not the way they used to be!<br/>

&gt; All of a sudden, the enchanter pipes up and asks in group &quot;Hey,<br/>
&gt; want a res?&quot;... the pally says yes of course, we&#39;re all thinking he has a<br/>
&gt; friend in the zone.  But instead, he sits down, camps, and pops back up<br/>
