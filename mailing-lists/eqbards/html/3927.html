It&#39;s dark inside so the ultravision song is handy.  It&#39;s<br/>
rather maze-like but very large so it isn&#39;t too bad.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
map the place, just wanted to see what was inside.  Mostly<br/>
green ice-boned skeletons.  There was one red human, looked<br/>
like a necromancer.  Sulan Mcboor or something like that.<br/>
Ready to attack, so I stayed away.  There were several more<br/>
passages that I didn&#39;t explore.  I&#39;ll try to map it some time.<br/>

If ice-bones give you good experience with little chance of<br/>
death, then it might be a good uncrowded area to play in.  If<br/>
you have to run though, or the bard dies, the rest of the<br/>
group is going to be in trouble since I&#39;m not sure you can<br/>
make the trip from the ice hole to the cave without the water<br/>
breathing song.<br/>
