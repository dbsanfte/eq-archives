<div id="ygrps-yiv-41022649">Wow.. thats a crazy system. Honestly don&#39;t think anyone in Paradigm would be<br/>
willing to take on the task of maintaining such a monster.  We don&#39;t have as<br/>
many members though, so if we were to expand I&#39;d almost say it would become<br/>
a necessity to have such a system.<br/>
<br/>
And yeah wow, those requirements are insane!<br/>

&gt; Best thing to do is go look at their point system:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org">http://www.afterlifeguild.org</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will answer most of the questions that pop into you head <br/>
&gt; as you think<br/>
&gt; about it. Also, note that the points assigned to mobs maybe updated<br/>
&gt; somewhere internally (ie they have more mobs listed where <br/>
&gt; else - I read that<br/>
&gt; when someone from AL was telling someone else to go there and <br/>
&gt; read it.)  But<br/>
&gt; in general you will see how it works for them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first saw their system - I was a bit taken aback.  But <br/>
&gt; after being in<br/>
&gt; a large guild with a totally different system, I can really <br/>
&gt; see some good<br/>
&gt; value in how they do it.  Our guild&#39;s policy is that loot <br/>
&gt; should go to those<br/>
&gt; who both need it in that they dont have a better item and <br/>
&gt; those who have<br/>
&gt; been trying to get it for the longest time.  Well, that turns <br/>
&gt; into &quot;the<br/>
&gt; oldest guild memebers in the class get all the best things first.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Essentially, everyone goes on most all of our raids and we do <br/>
&gt; not keep and<br/>
&gt; accurate attendance record. So, you have everyone saying: &quot;I <br/>
&gt; have been on<br/>
&gt; every POH/POF/POS, Naggy, Vox, VS, DS, Trak, etc etc since I <br/>
&gt; joined the<br/>
&gt; guild...&quot;  Also, our policy is that primary characters get loot before<br/>
&gt; secondarys.  Well, that becomes problematic when one gets <br/>
&gt; asked to play the<br/>
&gt; secondary because that is what this raid &quot;needs.&quot; So without <br/>
&gt; some point<br/>
&gt; system, who earns credit?  What happens if its your primary&#39;s <br/>
&gt; turn to loot<br/>
&gt; an item and they are not active in the raid? Say you have 3 <br/>
&gt; bards and one is<br/>
&gt; asked to play a cleric for VS raid.  Bard greaves drop. Do <br/>
&gt; you uncamp the<br/>
&gt; primary to loot and item when 2 others of that class were <br/>
&gt; fighting in the<br/>
&gt; raid?  Point systems can address these issues ahead of time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other thing to look at - for those of you who are <br/>
&gt; interested in &#39;what<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s like to be uber&#39; is the minimum equipment requirements <br/>
&gt; to join AL.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Here&#39;s a list of boring greenies we are not gonna camp for <br/>
&gt; you...&quot;  But<br/>
&gt; indeed it is a list that says you are well equipped and ready <br/>
&gt; for a variety<br/>
&gt; situations.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the other &#39;uber&#39; guilds on our server has a loot <br/>
&gt; policy that says<br/>
&gt; loot goes to the oldest and highest level players first.  <br/>
&gt; Their focus is on<br/>
&gt; level and they leveled as many as possible to 60 as soon as <br/>
&gt; possible.  That<br/>
&gt; did put them in good shpe to be doing Trak first and VS and <br/>
&gt; they have been<br/>
&gt; first ones in our server to go to VP.  Their focus is <br/>
&gt; different - to them<br/>
&gt; level is the number one thing.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So you guys use a point system?  I seem to remember talking <br/>
&gt; about this in a<br/>
&gt; thread a while back.  We have discussed using points on and off but it<br/>
&gt; always comes down to the fear that they won&#39;t be assigned <br/>
&gt; uniformly and also<br/>
&gt; that nobody would want the responsibility of maintaining such <br/>
&gt; a thing.   We<br/>
&gt; use more of a deferment system.. aka peer pressure.. which <br/>
&gt; seems to work<br/>
&gt; most of the time, though.  Do you like the point system? Can <br/>
&gt; you use point<br/>
&gt; for any item you want or does it have to be an item that is <br/>
&gt; &quot;clearly&quot; for<br/>
&gt; your class?<br/>
