<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487392465">Yes, I must admit that my travels have been the most rewarding. I remember<br/>
the amazement at the sight of my first Griffin (Who had just fell a fellow<br/>
traveler, and then made me victim #2) and Hill Giant (I assume it was a Hill<br/>
Giant, (I was -WAY- bigger than me and I did not get a long look for I was<br/>
grabbing my drum and hitting the Aslentronto(sp?) song at the time; while<br/>
tearing off on one long scream).<br/>
<br/>
	I must admit that the huge statue outside the gates of Kaladim, and the<br/>
Kaladimum mines where quite a sight. And the Forrest city of Kelethin was<br/>
amassing (but watch your step, it is a LONGGGG way to the forest floor). And<br/>
the people have many stories and quest for you to partake of. Not to mention<br/>
the sights to be found in the Sea of Tears it self. All well worth the boat<br/>
ride out of Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
	So fellow travelers of Norrath, I implore you to se the world as much as<br/>
possible. it may not fill your purse, but it will fill your mind...<br/>

&gt; I had JUST made level 8 - and at first was pretty annoyed at not<br/>
&gt; having easy<br/>
&gt; access to the song.  I found a high level bard to lead me to Kelethin and<br/>
&gt; the bard&#39;s guild (he needed the 11th spell).  The trip was long<br/>
&gt; and boring -<br/>
&gt; but it gave me an opportunity to practice my lute playing...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After getting the Bard&#39;s guild in Kelethin - confirmed I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have enough<br/>
&gt; cash to buy it (which I expected) - so I figure what the hell -<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll try to<br/>
&gt; meet some people and operate out of the area.  I had a great time<br/>
&gt; - met new<br/>
&gt; people, saw new sights, and killed new critters.  The Steamfont Mountains<br/>
&gt; are particularly cool.  The windmills are particularly impressive (ooc -<br/>
&gt; makes me want to go back and visit Holland again).<br/>
