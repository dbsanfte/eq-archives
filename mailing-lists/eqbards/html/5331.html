<div id="ygrps-yiv-141904195">Bad news for you. Medium armor does not say MEDIUM it says ARMOR. But<br/>
you will find that it IS medium if you compare it to SMALL. and even if<br/>
you did not buy it for AC or WEIGHT, you will find that the additional<br/>
weight sucks with our lower strength. I don;t know ANYONE that is not<br/>
concerned with weight... and if you are not, just wait, you will be.<br/>
<br/>
The poster who replied to you was just saying that SMALL armor was<br/>
available, and it was close and it weighs less that the armor you<br/>
bought. Why not buy armor that looks the same, is same AC, and weighs<br/>
LESS?<br/>

&gt; Call me crazy (shouts from the crowd &#39;YOUR CRAZY&#39;) but<br/>
&gt; upon further inspection of my bronze, no where on it<br/>
&gt; does it have a size, much like blackened iron, which<br/>
&gt; can be slid off of a wood elf and on to, say, a troll.<br/>
&gt;  And besides, I didn&#39;t buy it for ac or weight, I<br/>
&gt; bought it for looks.  Not a lot of wood elves on my<br/>
&gt; server wearing it, and at least 4 times when I get on<br/>
&gt; some one asks me if it&#39;s crested :)<br/>
