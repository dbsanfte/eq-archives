how they do it.  I&#39;ve been in some very good large groups, including one<br/>
last night with 2 dwarf clerics, a gnome warrior, a wild-elf druid, and an<br/>
elf caster.  We hunted orcs in the edge of the Oasis of Marr, a very<br/>
dangerous place.  We were quite successful in terms of both experience and<br/>
loot, while ridding the world of some of the endless supply of orcs.  Being<br/>
human I was the tallest of the group and neither the least nor the most deadly.<br/>
<br/>
Good groups are usually happy to have a capable bard along.  Group buffs,<br/>
fast running, and quicker group healing are much appreciated.<br/>
