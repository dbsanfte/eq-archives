<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728155893">Elfson Allegro came out of retirment on Friday after some coaxing from<br/>
his guildmates.  (&quot;Come on Elfy, you&#39;re our guild only bard and WE WANT<br/>
OUR CLARITY SONG&quot;).  After a day of very profitable gargoyle hunting (2<br/>
lvl 20&#39;s, as my roomate decided to join me, 100P a peice in 4 hours), I<br/>
set out to start buying some base equipment and catching up to my guild<br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
Got into a real good bird bashing group (Fatty SK, Ranger, Warrior,<br/>
Druid, Enchanter and little old &quot;We don&#39;t care what you do as long as<br/>
you sing the heal song&quot; me).  THe enchanter and I talked strategies and<br/>
we decided that his mana was best spent hasting the  three melees,<br/>
breezing the druid and himself, and the occasional mez.  That left me to<br/>
sing Binding, Hymm and Chant of Battle (three proccing weapons in the<br/>
group).  After a few fights, it seemed I was unable to sing Chant of<br/>
Battle when I was hasted AND fighting.  The particles would appear, but<br/>
no one would get the icon or spell message.  When there was no fight<br/>
going on or I wasn&#39;t hasted the song would work fine.  Does anyone knwo<br/>
what was going on?<br/>
<br/>
Second question, when fighting Avocets I could not get binding to stick<br/>
at all, so I was trying to think of something to replace it with.  I<br/>
sung guardian rhythms (for the little ac buff).  Any suggestions for<br/>
songs to sing when the mob is too high level for my songs to affect<br/>
them?  I sing Hymm, Anthem/COB, but I need a third song for that<br/>
melody.  I am lvl 21, so no Psalm yet.<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
