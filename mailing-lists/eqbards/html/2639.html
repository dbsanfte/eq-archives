I think you are talking about the L23 song, the Constant<br/>
Chain.  This is basically a short-term snare (never seen it<br/>
last more than the standard 3 ticks).  It is VERY useful for<br/>
snagging those monsters that like to run and bring back<br/>
friends, especially since the bard can &quot;cast&quot; it while chasing<br/>
(spellcasters can&#39;t do that).  I think it was weakened<br/>
recently, as last night I had mobs I&#39;d chained breaking out of<br/>
it frequently before the 3 ticks were up, and a couple times<br/>
almost immediately.  I&#39;d rarely seen that before.<br/>
<br/>
The L21 song is fun to play with, but it&#39;s not necessary.<br/>
Save your platinum if you like.<br/>
