<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596851836">Mana and the Jig O Vigor, true or rumor?<br/>
<br/>
Tonight with a group, one member complained about me negating his SoW, but I<br/>
had no accel going (sheesh was in the group three minutes and hadn&#39;t sung a<br/>
note, besides why would I?  They were campers).  So I memorized Jig and<br/>
played it, mentioning how I thought it was supposed to increase regeneration<br/>
%15.  The cleric informed me Jig was making his mana regenerate slower, he<br/>
&quot;should have been done by now.&quot;  Far from it for me to play a song not<br/>
wanted, forgot the Jig.  After an easy battle and burnt mana, he told me,<br/>
indeed, mana regenerates faster without any bard Jig.  Then things became<br/>
nasty, one fellow brought a train and I saved them all with a lullaby, and<br/>
no accelerando might I add, and quite a haul to the zone.  But they thought<br/>
they were just good or lucky for all surviving that time and I didn&#39;t want<br/>
to try explaining to them what I did, so I just camped!  Got me a little<br/>
irritated, just the remark that Jig was making them regenerate slower!?  OO,<br/>
that&#39;s what got me.<br/>
<br/>
All I know--these folks were hostile towards bards, and the fellow who was<br/>
the leader had to flee so I only met him briefly, perhaps he understood our<br/>
usefulness better.  When I hit a bad group I don&#39;t stick around, so I was<br/>
with them maybe ten minutes tops, but perhaps I can&#39;t fault them from<br/>
experiences I&#39;ve had with fellow bard&#39;s I&#39;ve grouped with--some bards just<br/>
don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, this class takes some skill to wield with<br/>
finesse.  I was with a bard once who consistently played hymn when all<br/>
health was full, and only used bellow in battle.  That, now that, got me<br/>
irritated.<br/>
<br/>
Er, back to my original question about Jig and Mana, sorry.  Has anyone done<br/>
any definitive tests on this?  With all my bard songs I have been able to<br/>
&quot;play around&quot; with them enough, to my satisfaction, to understand O how they<br/>
work.  This is the way I like things, dead reckonings hands-on kind of<br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for how they work rather than really writing up numbers myself.<br/>
Thing is, I studied way too much experimental methodology in school to<br/>
really enjoy doing it when I&#39;m playing, heheh.  (Memories of torturing lab<br/>
rats!)<br/>
<br/>
But I have no way to get an instinctive feel for this!  DOES mana regenerate<br/>
faster with Jig or not?  Anyone really use a stopwatch with a buddy?  My<br/>
friends keep telling me they don&#39;t have stopwatches and have no time for<br/>
testing.  I know it doesn&#39;t make regeneration slower, that cleric tonight<br/>
was just an arse, but I saved him anyway, fool didn&#39;t even realize it.<br/>
