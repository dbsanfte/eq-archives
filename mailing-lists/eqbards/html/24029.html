In hell levels, the exp you lose from dying is barely noticable.. but in the<br/>
level afterwards, you stand to lose a bubble of exp (yellow) with each<br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, i got 3 yellow bubbles into 31, so i say to my group, lets try<br/>
drachnids in FV, well i died 3 times in a row trying to get my corpse, and<br/>
undinged back into hell, luckily there was a 57 cleric nice enough to ress<br/>
all 3 corpses :)<br/>

&gt; I finished 28, and did all of 29 in Dalnir&#39;s.  It *is* pretty hairy, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve moved out, and alternate between the FM giants and just inside OT for<br/>
&gt; level 30.  I really, really don&#39;t want to die while in level 30.  hehe...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do want to go back for the dungeon bonus, though, once I&#39;m safely into<br/>
31.<br/>
&gt; :) </span></blockquote></div>
