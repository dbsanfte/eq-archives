<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611793120">I believe that they said that pets take &quot;2 percent&quot; of a group&#39;s experience, which is more than made up<br/>
for by the presence of the pet.  But I think this was a seat-of-the-pants guesstimate as to how often a<br/>
pet would do a majority of the damage (and hence take half the exp).  I think they still get half the exp<br/>
if they do a majority of the damage.<br/>

&gt; Could be wrong, but I really do remember a quote as saying pets take no exp,<br/>
