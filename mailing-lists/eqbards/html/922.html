&gt; Do you often wonder who&#39;s behind the character you see on the screen?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wonder how many real females actually play the game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The name was on my list, seemed to fit a bard, and sounded<br/>
female, so the character ended up female.  Like I said, I<br/>
hadn&#39;t intended it to be my main character.  If I had, I<br/>
probably would&#39;ve done things much differently (I put 25<br/>
points into charisma so I could use the character to test<br/>
the range of prices too).<br/>

and engineers are a sort of jack of all trades.  The ranger is<br/>
also considered the archetypical hybrid, and the druid is<br/>
supposed to be the swiss army knife of spellcasters (can heal,<br/>
can nuke, can buff, can debuff, can travel), and they were my<br/>
other top choices for characters.  I guess I like playing jack<br/>
of all trades types.<br/>
