 </span></blockquote>Got really bored last night.  Haven&#39;t had time to max out my <br/>
bardly skills, so I took a break from the bump and grind (er<br/>
hack and slash, hehe) to hit the arena and pump up Brass.<br/>
<br/>
I went from 155 to 170 in about two hours with Screech. (brass)<br/>

You can always tell if the instrument used is the correct<br/>
one if it plays it&#39;s animation.  Granted the mino horn<br/>
doesn&#39;t have one (bug), and the Brass horn doesn&#39;t do it&#39;s<br/>
animation unless you actually hit something with DDD or<br/>
Screech (but I think it does one animation and then just <br/>
stops after the initial startup, so you can tell if it is<br/>
the right instrument)<br/>
