regret even trying to make since it did not come across correctly, <br/>
and now i am the stupid bard who doesn&#39;t know how to play.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Shada<br/>

nobody thought that. :)  I did misunderstand your prior post <br/>
(abbreviated as it was), tho.  This definitely clears it up and I <br/>
think it&#39;s obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I agree with the other post you made... To me, this is all a <br/>
(sometimes intelligent) discussion. :)  Hopefully, &quot;arguing&quot; was just <br/>
a poor choice of words and nobody is truly thinking of it on that <br/>
level.  If anyone is, I&#39;m sure someone can remind all of us that EQ <br/>
is just a game. :)<br/>
