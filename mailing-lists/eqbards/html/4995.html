<div id="ygrps-yiv-546608698"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; but I always felt the battlefield should<br/>
&gt; be for the warriors, while the mages<br/>
&gt; stayed back home in their towers<br/>
&gt; (casting spells fropm there!) or<br/>
&gt; perhaps stood on hills overlooking the<br/>
&gt; battles.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve just recently started a Wizard (tired of kill stealers getting my<br/>
kills) and I can say now from personal experience that what you say you want<br/>
above, is how it is. Wizards can&#39;t get into the fight on the field and do<br/>
any good. They need to stand back overlooking the battle and cast spells<br/>
from afar. Otherwise, their frail bodies are swiped aside in a quick death.<br/>
<br/>
As a Wizard, you start with 20 hit points. They don&#39;t go up quickly after<br/>
that either. At level 5 I believe I have 60 (going from memory). I&#39;m finding<br/>
that a Wizard is VERY hard to solo in the first 5 levels compared to the<br/>
Bard. Spells are easily interrupted (even when standing still and not being<br/>
attacked) and if something isn&#39;t affected by one of your spells, you&#39;re<br/>
toast. No Selo&#39;s to escape with, not enough time to gate, no way to run fast<br/>
enough.. just toast. Also keep in mind that Wizards have NO healing spells.<br/>
I helped someone out last night while fighting something that was red to me<br/>
(I&#39;m a sucker for someone in trouble).. It killed her, I killed it (with<br/>
like 5 hp&#39;s left and no mana) and then ended up dying from the poison. Had I<br/>
had Hymn at level 4, or minor healing at level 1, I would have lived. I have<br/>
a certain respect for Wizards that have made it to level 12 and above now..<br/>
But I still love my Bard and his less-than-perfect songs..<br/>

easily killed.<br/>
