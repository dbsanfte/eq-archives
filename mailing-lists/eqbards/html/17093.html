rangers, but it&#39;s only for the taunt value of the nuke.<br/>

nuker.  List the classes that come to mind when your group<br/>
needs a speed debuffer.  List the classes that come to mind<br/>
when your group needs an attack speed buffer.  List the<br/>
classes that come to mind when your group needs a crowd<br/>
controller.  List the classes that come to mind when your<br/>
group needs a healer.<br/>
<br/>
In all of those, you will find that a substitute class is<br/>
about 67%-80% as effective as the optimal class.  Except us.<br/>

&gt; just me showing class envy.   For whatever reason (design by Verant,<br/>

<br/>
Our job was to crowd control (broken), attack buff (since<br/>
shown to be rather anemic), and reduce downtime (still our<br/>
primary title, but boy is it boring).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just distressed because high-level bard life is turning<br/>
out to be a bore.  Why do you think I&#39;ve been pushing the<br/>
envelope trying silly things like soloing the froglok noble?  <br/>
I tried soloing two SKs simultaneously a couple nights ago<br/>
(and barely succeeded due to judicious use of Screech).<br/>
<br/>
What I loved about playing a bard in mid-levels was that I<br/>
constantly had to be making decisions and adjustments.  Which<br/>
mobs do I crowd control?  Do I heal, fight with weapons, swap<br/>
a resist buff for an attack buff?  I&#39;d have to constantly<br/>
monitor the group&#39;s hp bars, the hp/status of varios mobs, ask<br/>
for mana status, etc. whem making these decisions.  It was<br/>
exhilarating because it was so non-deterministic.  All you<br/>
could do was make decisions that best improved your<br/>
probability of success (which is why I&#39;ve devoted so much time<br/>
to exactly quantifying what our songs do).<br/>
<br/>
Now it&#39;s play Verses (and maybe a resist buff) while fighting,<br/>
Hymn+Niv&#39;s+Clarity during downtime.  That&#39;s so simple and<br/>
brainless it took me 10 minutes to program a gamepad to do it<br/>
for me.  Our crowd control is so broken that when faced with 2<br/>
mobs, it was just as effective for me to ignore the extra and<br/>
let it beat on me while I fought, as it was for me to control<br/>
it.  What fun is that?  With few exceptions, basically all the<br/>
thinking required to play this class well between L5-45 has<br/>
disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
I *love* grouping with enchanters, but now their presence<br/>
means I don&#39;t even have to think about whether I should play<br/>
Verses.  The wide variety of classes in this game should force<br/>
people to make decisions.  Do we want a wizard to nuke/evac,<br/>
or do we want a mage for the pet?  Do we want a cleric for his<br/>
awesome heals, or can we make do with a shaman and his speed<br/>
debuffs?  When you mostly give a class a abilites that are<br/>
significantly subpar to other class&#39;, then the decision<br/>
becomes a no-brainer, and IMHO you defeat the purpose of<br/>
having classes.<br/>
