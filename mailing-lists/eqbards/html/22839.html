No Personal Delivery of Presents for World&#39;s Children From Santa This Year<br/>
Associated Press<br/>
<br/>
NORTH POLE (AP) -- In a startling announcement, Santa Claus has sent word <br/>
that he will not be delivering presents personally this year as he has had <br/>
no time to prepare for his annual holiday ride. &quot;Santa hasn&#39;t been training <br/>
this year like he usually does for the big day,&quot; says an elf who asked for <br/>
anonymity. He went on to state that ever since Santa Claus started playing <br/>
Everquest┬« , a popular online role playing game distributed by Sony Online <br/>
Entertainment Inc, he has not had the time nor the inclination to work out <br/>
in the off-season.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are all very concerned about Santa, however, in an effort to ensure <br/>
that each child still receives their presents, we have signed an exclusive <br/>
contract with Federal Express, stated Jingle Elf, the official spokesman <br/>
for Santa Corp.<br/>
<br/>
Children around the world seemed to take the news indifferently. &quot;As long <br/>
as I get my Playstation 2,&quot; stated Samuel, age 12, &quot;Santa can do what he <br/>
wants. It&#39;s not like we ever get to see him anyway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I see Santa in Norrath all the time. We have a PoM raid this weekend,&quot; <br/>
states Frank, age 16. He further explained that Santa&#39;s &quot;leet enchanter <br/>
rocks&quot; and that Santa&#39;s guild consisted of only &quot;dark elves&quot;.<br/>
