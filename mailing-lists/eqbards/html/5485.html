<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614379761">I was gonna zip thru HH in early evening and run to Freep for something.<br/>
Orcs were not camped and running loose.  I got bounced by 3 and ran to the<br/>
guard on the lake.  He started and I got greedy and wanted to beat on orcs<br/>
to build 1hb skill - new screaming mace and all.  In the melee I was<br/>
switching targets and.....<br/>
<br/>
you try to crush a guard and miss<br/>
you crush a guard for 1 point of damage<br/>
a guard slashes for 42 points of damage...<br/>
a orc warrior hits you for 32 points of damage...<br/>
you are stunned...<br/>
etc. etc.<br/>
Loading...<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Back to Level 21!<br/>
<br/>
ugh - off to the Keep and back to 22 in 20 minutes. Screaming mace back to<br/>
the bank until I can train up some points in to 1HB.<br/>

		Damn, was last night everyone&#39;s night to die multiple times?<br/>
<br/>
		I had my first triple-death night since I was trying to help<br/>
		someone find and retrieve their corpse in Runnyeye 5 levels<br/>
		ago.  Barely held onto 32.  I made the mistake of running<br/>
back<br/>
		to Cazic without a flute, and ended up stuck at the zone<br/>
with<br/>
		a train on one side and a bouncer on the other.  Sometimes<br/>
		having a fast computer that zones quickly is not a good<br/>
		thing...<br/>
