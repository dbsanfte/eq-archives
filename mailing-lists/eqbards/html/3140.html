<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973273774">ok if you are in unrest i will assume you are grouped and someone is pulling<br/>
or tanking.  yes mobs are very hard to target, so never use the mouse to<br/>
target.  whoever the entire group is supposed to assist so you all have the<br/>
same target (be it your puller or tank), hit the function key that<br/>
corresponds to his/her player in your group (f2 to f6) then type /as and hit<br/>
enter.  it works every time for me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 5. Why oh WHY are some critters so hard to target? I&#39;ll be in <br/>
&gt; unrest - 2<br/>
&gt; darkbones banging on my crew - a deeth beetle at my feet - and the dam<br/>
&gt; deeth beetle is the only thing I can manage to target? I try <br/>
&gt; to use assist,<br/>
&gt; but it seems very, very buggy - more than half the time - it <br/>
&gt; just doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work. Is there some reason that F8 couldn&#39;t CYCLE thru the <br/>
&gt; nearest mob&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; instead of only the one IT thinks is closest?<br/>
