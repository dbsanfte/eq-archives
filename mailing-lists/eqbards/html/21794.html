<div id="ygrps-yiv-946287211">Please remember my motto in all things I post.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I may not be the Devil&#39;s advocate, but I play one in EQ&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying bard&#39;s are worthless or that EQ is a terrible game.  Bards<br/>
are not worthless they just don&#39;t get the treatment the class deserves and<br/>
that other, better internally represented ones do.  Our issues are never a<br/>
priority and we generally get the brush-off even after testing.<br/>
<br/>
EQ isn&#39;t a horrible game, quite the opposite.  Verant&#39;s customer service and<br/>
general attitude on the other hand are horrible.  How would you feel if you<br/>
bought a loaf of bread that was stale and the grocery store told you &quot;sorry,<br/>
that&#39;s just the way that bread is&quot;.  Verant does the equivalent to their<br/>
customers every day.  The guild doesn&#39;t dislike EQ, but they would never<br/>
invest the time they put into it in another Verant game.  We have been<br/>
gradually losing members over this for some time now.<br/>
