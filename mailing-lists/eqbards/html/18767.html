<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059522123">I think some of us are losing sight of what the bard class is.  We&#39;re<br/>
traveling minstrels, not warriors.  Symphonic Harmony proc (Evade) and<br/>
summond food and drink are PERFECT for bards.  Symphonic Harmony indicrectly<br/>
gives us a rogue skill that keeps us from taking quite so much damage.  This<br/>
in turn makes up for some of the low AC on some of the items - assuming the<br/>
proc WORKS (which it probably does, since the Evade skill works).  Also, the<br/>
food and drink that you summon can be given to your group as well.  This<br/>
means that not only you, but your party members don&#39;t have to want for food<br/>
and drink either.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have Singing Steel Gauntlets (Enduring Breath) and they&#39;ve already<br/>
made my life easier several times.<br/>
<br/>
Guys, we&#39;re a support class not warriors remember?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; fyi the stats on singing steel greaves are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AC 24 8str 8sta 8agi 8cha Effect: *drum roll* Summon Food<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; nice stats and AC, but gimme a break on the effect (i may be wrong on the<br/>
&gt; stats, but the AC is right and there are defeinitely 3 or 4 stats<br/>
&gt; +8).  the<br/>
&gt; cobalt (warrior) greaves have effect: invisibility on top of phenomenal AC<br/>
&gt; and stats.  what a novel thought, give a class something they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t normally<br/>
&gt; have and something they would absolutely love!  i mean so far the AC on<br/>
&gt; singing steel is better than all imbrued pieces, and seems all classes<br/>
&gt; gloves/boots/arms/bracers will have an effect and good AC but no stats,<br/>
&gt; while the legs all have stats.   and most likely the BP when someone<br/>
&gt; eventually finds one, supposedly all having effect: gate,<br/>
&gt; something no melee<br/>
&gt; class gets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shada<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. no i didn&#39;t get the greaves, but i did get an RBB =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmm, let me make sure I understand this. The effect on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; boots and gloves<br/>
&gt; &gt; is so powerful that they made the AC lower. </span></blockquote></div>
