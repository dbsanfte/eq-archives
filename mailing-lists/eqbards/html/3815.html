&gt;I&#39;m not failing to see, I just have a different opinion on what an MMORPG<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;than you do :)  Now if you want to call it an MMOVW (virtual world) yes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>then<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would expect trade skills to be a large part of it.  As a roleplaying<br/>
 </span></blockquote>game<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for me, EQ has everything that I could ask for.  Yes there needs to be some<br/>
&gt;work, but admit it, the trade skills are not put in for the *fun* value.<br/>
&gt;They are put in there to make money so you can buy better equipment so you<br/>
&gt;can go fight more stuff (or in UO, kill other people).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to disaggree with you on this.  The thing many people seem to miss is<br/>
the definition of RPG.... which stands for ROLE PLAYING GAME.  For me, and<br/>
many many other people, ROLE PLAYING means creating a character, with a<br/>
background, a mind, a personality, likes and dislikes, and yes... hobbies.<br/>
And that&#39;s what trade skills do for you.  They give you the chance to flesh<br/>
out that character.... and while it would be nice if you could make a small<br/>
amount of money at it, for me it isnt necessary.  My bard has a ball brewing<br/>
new drinks to give her friends to try out, and has recently taken up baking<br/>
for her betrothed as he experessed an interest in trying some of the<br/>
recipies he had heard of.  It&#39;s FUN.  It&#39;s IN CHARACTER.  It ADDS DEPTH to<br/>
the role playing experience.  And it&#39;s not so tedious as it was to start<br/>
with, and may well get less so as time passes.  It&#39;s certainly NOT work.  At<br/>
least, not unless you make it so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I do have one thing to<br/>
&gt;say about your last line though:  people that pay real money for online<br/>
&gt;stuff have 2 things and missing one thing.  1) Alot of money, 2) Alot of<br/>
&gt;time, and the thing they are missing is sense.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here I have to agree with you though.  As far as I am concerned, the person<br/>
who pays several hundred RL dollars for 1000 plat in game has a hell of alot<br/>
more money than sense... and WAY more money than they really need.  Though I<br/>
admit I find myself wishing I had the time to get that much plat together<br/>
and auction it off... because that would very likely solve my RL financial<br/>
problems. =)<br/>
