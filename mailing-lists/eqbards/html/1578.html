<div id="ygrps-yiv-932447556">Not neccessarily true. I didn&#39;t have enough faction to get a ring from the<br/>
sherrif but a friend of mine who I had helped out tremendously gave me one.<br/>
After messing up in using the charge I took it back to the cleric and she<br/>
recharged it for me. My faction still wasn&#39;t high enough to get a ring on my<br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
	At level 22 though, I find very little use for it and I&#39;m actually<br/>
considering dumping it for some of the new bejeweled rings once the<br/>
jewelcraft patch sets in.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)Some people are selling the squad ring, but it is a scam.<br/>
8)Since if your<br/>
8)faction is not high enough to get the ring yourself in the<br/>
8)first place, you<br/>
8)won&#39;t be able to recharge the ring or get a new ring once you<br/>
