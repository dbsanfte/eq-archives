<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765774506"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Bear in mind that 99.9% of the games out there do not take<br/>
&gt; &gt; advantage of the GeForce&#39;s improved hardware (transformation<br/>
&gt; &gt; and lighting is still handled by the CPU).  This includes EQ.<br/>
&gt; &gt; While a GeForce will give you a moderate speedup over a TNT2,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it will not give you the huge boost in speed you see in some<br/>
&gt; &gt; reviews.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here I would DEFINATELY disagree... sorry.  Why? Because my brother<br/>
&gt; in law has the same setup with a TNT2 and my wife has the same setup<br/>
&gt; with a Voodoo 3 3500.  I can do things with my GeForce at 1024X768<br/>
&gt; that they can&#39;t hope to achieve at 640x480.  There is a HUGE<br/>
&gt; performance increase that is VERY noticable if you have your<br/>
&gt; computers side by side as I do.  Let&#39;s take a 24 person raid on Kedge<br/>
&gt; Keep as an example.  Chat off, particle density off, same setup on<br/>
&gt; all 3 computers and they were both lagging and had much much lower<br/>
&gt; frame rates at 800X600 then I.  I was as smooth at 1024x768 as I<br/>
&gt; would have been had I been the only one in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your statement does not give enough information.  If you all have the same<br/>
setup as each other (except video cards) and the systems are NOT PIII or<br/>
Athlon then you will see tremendous improvements from the GeForce Card over<br/>
the TNT2 Ultra in all areas.  Otherwise (if you did have a PIII setup or an<br/>
Athlon to a much lesser extent) in many areas the TNT2 Ultra will do almost<br/>
as well as the GeForce card.   This is because the PIII SSE and the Athlon<br/>
3dNOW instruction sets do a lot of the work that the GeForce processor does<br/>
thus giving a &#39;diminishing returns&#39; effect to the GeForce.  There&#39;s still<br/>
improvement by upgrading (as I said before) but it&#39;s not as much.<br/>
<br/>
See Tom&#39;s Hardware page for a full run-down on the differences and<br/>
advantages of GeForce 256 DDR over Riva TNT2 Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
There is still a noticeable improvement of the GeForce over a TNT 2 Ultra<br/>
but is the difference worth $300?  Not in my world but others may have a lot<br/>
more money to throw around.  As I said in an earlier post:<br/>
<br/>
If you have an older system an upgrade to the GeForce may be a good idea.<br/>
If you&#39;re on a newer PIII system I would wait till the NV15 or Bitboys new<br/>
Graphics cards come out.  Both cards are at least 4 times better than the<br/>
GeForce and should market at about $400.<br/>
<br/>
Up to the buyer:  $300 (yes I know you can get them for around $230-$260 as<br/>
well) now and $400 later this year?  Or stick to what works now and just pay<br/>
$400 later?  The advantages of the GeForce are great.  It&#39;s<br/>
an AWESOME card.  But I would recommend doing some pretty extensive reading<br/>
about the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of the GeForce (or any 2nd gen card)  before I run<br/>
out and buy it.  3rd Generation cards are just around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
OH:  For the hard core Gamers:  If you get a Gig system:  Don&#39;t get one<br/>
based on Intel&#39;s i820 or i840 chipset, get either the VIA FBS 133 chipset<br/>
with 133 SDRAM or get a BX 440 chipset and overclock the board to 133mhz and<br/>
use SDRAM 133.  You will get FAR better performance out of the Intel Gig<br/>
system on those Mboards and your games (IE:  EverQuest) will run a lot<br/>
better.</div>
