<b>Subject:</b> Re: Pixie strike versus interrupting spell casters <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102494430">Ah, that&#39;s good to know.  I never knew there was a case where the spell just<br/>
failed due to outside interference.  I was under the impression that all<br/>
external inputs got a channel &#39;save&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks John!<br/>

Prior to this, my experience was that Lullaby, Pixie Strike,<br/>
stun, and mesmerize would interrupt 100% of the time if it<br/>
wasn&#39;t resisted and stuck before they finished casting.<br/>
They&#39;re equivalent to being stunned by a mob - that will<br/>
interrupt your casting 100% regardless of channeling.<br/>
