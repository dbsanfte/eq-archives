<div id="ygrps-yiv-388692853"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Sounds like people are having mixed experiences, but I travelled with 2<br/>
&gt; level 30&#39;s. One was a dwarf, but I think they&#39;re factions are good in Sol A.<br/>
&gt; The other was a level 30 Erudite Wizard, who calmly walked past a wizard who<br/>
&gt; blasted me to smithereens. He&#39;s been able to walk through that room before<br/>
&gt; without getting aggro&#39;d on, so maybe it&#39;s just me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ll buy that.  It&#39;s not out of the scope of things we&#39;ve seen before.<br/>
  Punish the bards!  It&#39;s just that warm aura I put out when I travel<br/>
  along.  Or maybe it&#39;s because my CHA (and natural good looks) are so<br/>
  much better than the goblins&#39; and they frenzy on me.<br/>
