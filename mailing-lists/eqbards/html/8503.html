 </span></blockquote>Hrm, I disagree. A warrior in banded will outlast (against the same mob) a<br/>
bard of equal level in better armor simply because the warrior will have<br/>
like TRIPLE the hitpoints, and that will make a ton of difference.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is true with rangers vs. warriors - for example, my ranger in<br/>
mostly rubicite will not be as good of a tank as a warrior my level in<br/>
banded - just because of the hitpoint difference. I would say this<br/>
difference would be much more pronounced if you use a bard in the example,<br/>
because bards have even LESS hitpoints.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m just talking about taking damage - sure, bards can use songs to<br/>
counter their disadvantages. But, my point is that better armor will not<br/>
make a bard a better tank than a warrior of equal level.<br/>
