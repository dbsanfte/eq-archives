&gt;I honestly don&#39;t know why this bothers ppl to this extent. When you get lvl<br/>

&gt;you will feel the same way. The ONLY lvl 50 people I know that haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;twinked a character were unable to because they are on other servers. You<br/>
&gt;get sick of being a newbie, and twinking makes it much easier to get passed<br/>
&gt;this very boring phase of a newbie&#39;s life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I first got EQ I had a blast being a newbie, learning the ropes,<br/>
&gt;running from little goblins and orcs. Now - I would skip directly to lvl 14<br/>

&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>
&gt;&gt;and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;&gt;seen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk up to 23rd and an<br/>
&gt;&gt;Enchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing that the best class<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Last night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent, dual Ykeshas, Flowing<br/>
&gt;&gt;Black<br/>
&gt;&gt;Silk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked out like a level 50<br/>
&gt;&gt;that hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago I saw a level 15 in<br/>
&gt;&gt;full Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other goodies as well.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly* discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;&gt;working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor that I have and I<br/>
&gt;&gt;*still*<br/>
&gt;&gt;lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on the sands of Oasis,<br/>
&gt;&gt;being *less* complete than a guy that started his bard last weekend.  Not<br/>
&gt;&gt;only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having 38 &#39;played&#39; days and<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;When there ceases to be any way for players&#39; characters to differentiate<br/>
&gt;&gt;themselves from one another other based upon level (i.e. time and effort<br/>
&gt;&gt;expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want, when people look at<br/>
&gt;&gt;me,<br/>
&gt;&gt;for them to know that I braved death and died many times to achieve the<br/>
&gt;&gt;armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to assume that I bought it<br/>
&gt;&gt;from<br/>
&gt;&gt;a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>
&gt;&gt;different story.  The bard that I saw in Oasis would have been in steel<br/>
&gt;&gt;probably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based<br/>
 </span></blockquote>upon<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know* that I had earned the<br/>
&gt;&gt;pieces for myself.  They would know that I had pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>
&gt;&gt;Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>
&gt;&gt;for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not being NO DROP has reduced<br/>
&gt;&gt;my<br/>
&gt;&gt;efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes me<br/>
&gt;&gt;feel this way.<br/>
