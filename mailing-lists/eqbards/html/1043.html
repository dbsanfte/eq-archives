<div id="ygrps-yiv-70937784"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When you started counting, did you count the punch that began<br/>
&gt; your stopwatch?  That should be punch 0, not 1.  I did the<br/>
&gt; same timings with my monk a couple weeks ago and got about <br/>
&gt;3.5<br/>
&gt; seconds per punch, and I have a hard time believing bards can<br/>
&gt; punch faster than monks.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whops!<br/>
<br/>
Yes you are right.<br/>
<br/>
OK so my figures were wrong the number of hits should be reduced <br/>
by 1 for everything.<br/>
<br/>
So I did some calculations and it looks like I calculated to % <br/>
increase incorrectly the first time, but with my revised figures the % <br/>
are correct.<br/>
<br/>
Jonath Active  20% more attacks<br/>
Anthem Activem 15% more attacks<br/>
Both Active 25% more attacks<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is slighly less clear than mud. <br/>
Look I have had a hard weekend and have been up since 5am, I am <br/>
having problems remembering my name right now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, the difference between your stacked times (2.6-2.75<br/>
&gt; sec/hit) and only Whistling times (2.73-2.78) over a duration<br/>
&gt; of 40-50 seconds is only about 1 second.  That would appear to<br/>
&gt; be within your margin for error since one of your stacked<br/>
&gt; samples was in the range of just Whistling.  I&#39;m not saying<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re wrong, just that this isn&#39;t the strongest evidence for<br/>
&gt; it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is all based on a small sample. There is much potential for <br/>
error.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; New conclusions,<br/>
&gt; &gt; It is possible that these 2 songs get +5% to attack rate every 3 <br/>
&gt; &gt; levels up to a certain cap.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll try it again now that I&#39;m up to level 17.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would be good for somebody else to test this, if anybody cares.<br/>
