<div id="ygrps-yiv-83193701">I think it was fixed SEptember/October. It was a LONG time ago.<br/>
But I can remember the complaints on Druid&#39;s Grove about it not<br/>
working, people trying everything, and nothing seemed to<br/>
make the spell worth anything. Then, there were discussions -- with<br/>
GZ I think? and people started trying again. And suddenly it<br/>
was working. (Verant never said they fixed anything... but<br/>
some druids swore they had tried what eventually ended up being the<br/>
way to use the spell.)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that is a long time for him not to know.<br/>

&gt;Really?  I&#39;ve been using harmony successfully for months.  How <br/>
&gt;could he fail<br/>
&gt;to find out it worked for that long?  when did it get fixed?<br/>
