In my original message, I was THINKING of &quot;Well Balanced&quot;, when in fact I<br/>
typed &quot;Fine Steel&quot;.  Everyone knows that Fine Steel does NOT cost that much.<br/>
<br/>
THAT, my friends, is what happens when you&#39;ve played EQ until 3 in the<br/>
morning. My apologies!<br/>

&gt;A fine steel rapier can be bought from a player for around 7 or 8 pp.  A<br/>
&gt;combine rapier, 50pp or so.  A well-balanced rapier, however, costs over<br/>
&gt;200pp.  I use a rapier, and shall disagree with Talon, it is a respectable<br/>
&gt;weapon!  This is a choice for those with finesse, and the rapier benefits<br/>
&gt;greatly from song (a faster rapier is a deadly rapier), but comparing a FS<br/>
&gt;Rapier to a Dragoon Dirk?  Well, a Dragoon Dirk is a bit better than a well<br/>
&gt;balanced rapier.  But give me even a FS rapier, ANYday over something like<br/>

&gt;&gt;================================<br/>
&gt;&gt;Unless you plan to use TWO piercing weapons, or unless you just HAVE to<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;&gt;the &quot;car antenna&quot; look, totally forget about the FS Rapier. NEVER buy one.<br/>
&gt;&gt;It is inferior to the Dragoon Dirk, and is MUCH more expensive, too. I was<br/>
&gt;&gt;given a FS Rapier in trade, which you can buy from the vendor for approx<br/>
&gt;&gt;280pp. Well, I tried to sell it for 100pp, and EVERYONE laughed at me.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Looking at the stats... yes... a Dragoon Dirk IS better, and you can get<br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt;&gt;of those for 20-40pp. So, forget about it. Really. Honestly. Unless you<br/>
&gt;want<br/>
&gt;&gt;the look, or want to use 2 piercers.<br/>
