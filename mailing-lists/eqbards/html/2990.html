<div id="ygrps-yiv-666913334">I found that prices were good in Rivervale.  I teamed up with a halfling<br/>
cleric, and because my charisma is so high I was buying stuff cheaper than<br/>
even the halfling could.  Can&#39;t understand why nobody likes you, unless<br/>
you&#39;ve lowered your faction somehow.  If you kill the goblins in Misty<br/>
Thickett you&#39;ll improve you faction with the little ones.<br/>

Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I figured out how to get my songs on the hotkeys<br/>
... even applied it to a magic user &quot;sister&quot; of mine. &lt;s&gt;<br/>
 I&#39;ve been running around Rivervale, twisting my little<br/>
heart out (working pretty good I think) and killing<br/>
everything in sight.<br/>
<br/>
I have one problem though ... none of the vendors like<br/>
me.  Any npc that will sell to me looks at me<br/>
&quot;apprehensively&quot;.  I went to every npc I could find and<br/>
found one that was disinterested ... but he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
(couldn&#39;t) sell to me.  So I&#39;m making crap money on my<br/>
loot.  At this rate, I&#39;m never gonna be able to even<br/>
afford songs, let alone any equipment (sewing kit &<br/>
patterns for example).<br/>
<br/>
So I need help!  Either, point me to someone in Rivervale<br/>
who will offer me decent prices or ...  If there isn&#39;t<br/>
anyone that fits that bill, then I think I need to move<br/>
on to Qeynos.  In that case, I need good directions from<br/>
Rivervale to Qeynos.  Every travel guide I&#39;ve found gives<br/>
the directions the opposite way around ... and they&#39;re<br/>
not easily reversed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
