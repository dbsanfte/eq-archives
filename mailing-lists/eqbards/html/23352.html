<div id="ygrps-yiv-696471172">I agree with you in principal but not in fact.  I end up playing in pickup<br/>
groups most of the time because of where I live (Hawaii).  Most of my<br/>
guildmates have camped for the night by the time I log in.  In a pickup<br/>
group, most of the time you need a cleric and enchanter for the harder areas<br/>
in a dungeon strictly because its pretty hard to convince folks to go in<br/>
deeper if you have never grouped with them before.  The cleric and enchanter<br/>
are an insurance policy in case you get a crappy player(s) in your pickup<br/>
group.  I agree with you that if you have a smart shaman, druid, paladin etc<br/>
you can go to these places without a cleric and enchanter.  But unless you<br/>
hang out in a zone for a while and group (pickup groups) with the same<br/>
people over and over, the level of trust required to forego the<br/>
cleric/enchanter combo isn&#39;t likely to happen with a pickup group.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>AH HA!!!! someone finally did it and made this incredibly erroneous blanket<br/>
statement!!!<br/>
Post 50 to go to most locations is NOT in the LEAST impossible without an<br/>
enchanter<br/>
or cleric.  i&#39;ve personally done necrosis, jail, zonein, zoneout, and some<br/>
random mobs<br/>
(i.e. the right bridge after the 3 spawn) without a cleric.  hell, the time<br/>
i camped the bridge<br/>
thing i mentioned above was me, ranger and necro, just the 3 of us.  i&#39;ve<br/>
done kitchen, bar<br/>
and disco without an enchanter.  the other night i did crypt (admittedly<br/>
with 2 groups, but both<br/>
crypt guardian area and emperor area) where a necro and myself handled all<br/>
the crowd control,<br/>
even tho we had an enchanter (thnx speed, thnx clarity, hahahaha).<br/>
<br/>
If you are with people who know what they are doing and play their class<br/>
well, you don&#39;t need<br/>
cleric and enchanter.  (well, and if you have a shaman, but i digress)  My<br/>
personal theory,<br/>
and this doesn&#39;t necessarily apply to you slyde, just in general, is that a<br/>
lot of the mediocre<br/>
players are now hitting the 50+ level range a year and a half after release.<br/>
one thing is they<br/>
just aren&#39;t good enough to handle areas like the crypt or disco or kitchen<br/>
without the crutch<br/>
of the cleric/enchanter combo.  another factor is that a bunch of them<br/>
soloed a lot and now they<br/>
hit 50 and want to get phat lewtz out of dungeons and totally suck at<br/>
dungeon play.  so now all<br/>
of a sudden you have a bunch of players who can&#39;t handle the &#39;&#39;hard&#39;&#39; areas<br/>
and people start coming<br/>
up with your following statement about how it&#39;s a game flaw and verant<br/>
screwed up, blah blah blah,<br/>
when it&#39;s really that they just aren&#39;t good enough players.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;IMHO - this is a terrible flaw of EQ and needs to be rectified.  Improving<br/>
&gt;Crowd Control capabilities of Bards helped; and improving healing for<br/>
&gt;Shamans and Clerics could be another.  Perhaps there are other better ways<br/>
&gt;that don&#39;t involved &quot;nerfing&quot; clerics indirectly...<br/>
