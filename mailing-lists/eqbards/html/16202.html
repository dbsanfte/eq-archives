<div id="ygrps-yiv-799104714">True, he does, but a well balanced group _without_ a necro is far better<br/>
than a well balanced group _with_ a necro.  A good group will kill things<br/>
far faster than a necro can solo thus his &quot;real&quot; damage never gets started.<br/>
Necro&#39;s are very weak in groups because there&#39;s no time for their DoT&#39;s to<br/>
ramp up in dmg.  Typically it takes a full minute or more for a Necro DOT to<br/>
realize full potential in dmg.  Most fights with a good group last far less<br/>
than that (unless you&#39;re talking dragons/planes).<br/>
<br/>
A necro in a 2 or 3 member group isn&#39;t bad.  I&#39;m talking about in a full<br/>
balanced group.  Necro&#39;s just can&#39;t do enough dmg to matter in &#39;fast kill&#39;<br/>
situations (which are typical of full groups).  I&#39;d rather have someone who<br/>
can handle crowd control or who can dish out a lot of dmg very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
In a normal environment (non-planar/dragon)  with a full group I&#39;d far<br/>
rather have a magician<br/>
or enchanter than a necro.  Given a choice between a wizard/necro I&#39;d choose<br/>
a necro.  (then again I don&#39;t like most wizards.  Too many of them were KS<br/>
Freaks back before the Group Aggragate DMG patch)<br/>

&gt; &gt; In a group the Necro loses his &#39;long duration&#39; and becomes part of the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why I analyzed it in terms of damage rates.  To<br/>
&gt; eliminate fight duration as a variable.  In quick fights you<br/>
&gt; lose DoT mana:damage efficiency, but a group with a necro will<br/>
&gt; *always* be able to handle anything the necro could handle<br/>
&gt; solo (unless they&#39;re stupid).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Necro&#39;s can solo incredible npc&#39;s specifically because their pets give<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; &gt; a much higher &#39;survival time&#39; than any melee class enjoys.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
necros<br/>
&gt; &gt; fight npcs far longer than my ranger or my bard can.  Because they can<br/>
hurt<br/>
&gt; &gt; their oponent while healing themselves and their pet.  Pluss the pet<br/>
gives<br/>
&gt; &gt; them a &#39;pocket tank&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if you already have a puller/tank, why pick another tank<br/>
&gt; over a necro?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry to dissagree but Necro&#39;s are Awesome solo and only average<br/>
(actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; slightly below average) in a group.  Necro is one of the LAST classes I<br/>
&gt; &gt; consider when forming a group, even with their new spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your loss then.  The only multipliers in this game are bards<br/>
&gt; (group effects), Clarity, and stat buffs (which have minimal<br/>
&gt; effect).  Everything else is addative.  If a necro can solo a<br/>
&gt; mob that otherwise requires a group of 2+, making him group<br/>
&gt; with someone to do it cannot suddenly make him impotent.<br/>
