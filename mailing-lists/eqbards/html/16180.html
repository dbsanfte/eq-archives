<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760414376">We got bladestorm(s?) by  pulling I-3 mobs too close to their social (agro)<br/>
range.  We&#39;d pull something and get the something and a bladestorm.  Sorry<br/>
that&#39;s kinda vague but I did not see what exactly they were doing and the<br/>
discussion was about pulling too close to the edge of that side of the<br/>
island.<br/>

		Okay, next question.  Anyone know the &quot;trick&quot; to get the<br/>
blades to leave?<br/>
		Or any clue as to how this might be done?<br/>

		We had tried pulling Dojorn to the 3rd isle with no luck as<br/>
well (back in<br/>
		the levitating days of Air).  Now we take him on on his own<br/>
isle.  One of<br/>
		the Paladin&#39;s in our guild has found a way to trick the two<br/>
Bladestorms into<br/>
		leaving the island so we are able to fight Dojorn solo.  I<br/>
will try to<br/>
		observe his techinique next time he go up there.  The full<br/>
loot list from<br/>
		Dojorn last night was a Warrior haste belt, Golden Efreeti<br/>
Bow (ranger quest<br/>
		item), and Golden Efreeti Greeves.   On our first Dojorn<br/>
kill we got 4 items<br/>
		but 3 rotted due to confusion in the post-kill rezing order.<br/>
This time we<br/>
		did pre-lotto rolls per class for whatever dropped, saved<br/>
alot of trouble in<br/>
		that precious 8 mins post-kill time.<br/>
<br/>
		Also Dojorn is pretty much immune to magic.  So it is melee,<br/>
melee, melee.<br/>
		Our group got waxed as BOTH our healers went LD as soon as<br/>
the battle<br/>
		started :(  We had about 45 people there I believe.<br/>
