<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964296685">Hello I am at lvl 12 Wood elf bard.  it seems that I cannot find a good<br/>
place for me to solo.  I went to CB but the orc&#39;s hit so hard that it keeps<br/>
disrupting my song.  I died 5 times in there.  I went to Nro and all the<br/>
places has been camp out.  I was wondering if anyone know a good place to<br/>
solo at lvl 12.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx,<br/>
Your Friendly Rogue and Bard,<br/>
