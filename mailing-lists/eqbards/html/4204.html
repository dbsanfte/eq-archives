<div id="ygrps-yiv-27794848"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; &gt; if you don&#39;t want to lessen the gaming experience.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As I have stated earlier some people have a different definition of what<br/>
&gt; &gt; their gaming experience is.  You may enjoy something that I don&#39;t, and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, we&#39;re working off different reference frames here.  My<br/>
&gt; statement contains the implicit assumption that the player<br/>
&gt; receiving the items likes to strive for better equipment, and<br/>
&gt; is the player&#39;s primary or only character.  That description<br/>
&gt; fits *all* my friends, so I probably stated the above too<br/>
&gt; generally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s much too broad an assumption. I know about three dozen people with<br/>
alternate characters (2nd, 3rd, 4th) who they&#39;ve passed old equipment to.<br/>
I know about 3 people who simply deleted their old characters and started<br/>
a new character and passed old stuff to it.<br/>
<br/>
I like to strive for better equipment, but I get absolutely no enjoyment<br/>
out of striving for things like mino axes. What I find most fun is<br/>
striving for things I haven&#39;t gotten yet, not even with another character<br/>
(one of the reasons I tend to play very different characters -- caster,<br/>
bard, etc.). So you twink the mundane stuff (banded, weapon), which would<br/>
personally make me so bored getting again that I&#39;d probably just quit<br/>
Everquest.<br/>
<br/>
For me, doing 1-15 more than once is very boring. I still wouldn&#39;t skip<br/>
it, when doing a new class, simply because I need it to get practice using<br/>
the new skills and tactics of the new class, but I&#39;m very very eager to<br/>
speed it along. Since I already know the basics of game and tactics, I<br/>
don&#39;t need AS long to learn it either.<br/>
<br/>
15+ is where the game really starts getting fun for me, as all the<br/>
interesting dungeons (where it&#39;s easy to find good groups who don&#39;t just<br/>
want to go to one orc camp and sit there all day) begin to open up.<br/>
