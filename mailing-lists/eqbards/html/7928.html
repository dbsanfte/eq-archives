&gt;<br/>
&gt;But are you really making their life easier by twinking them?  Are you<br/>
&gt;really enhancing the playing experience?  I know a Druid, who was givin the<br/>
&gt;following equipment before they reached 2nd level: Full Leather Armor, many<br/>
&gt;snakeskin pieces including tunic, Bloodforge hammer, 2 cutthroat rings, at<br/>
&gt;least 50 plat.  Now whats next for her?  When she thinks about the &quot;next<br/>
&gt;cool item&quot; she wants to get her hands on.  She is thinking about items that<br/>
&gt;are WAY over her head.  She is now 13th level, and she still hasent out<br/>
&gt;grown any of her equipment.  And now after 13 levels she is realizing that<br/>
&gt;it is very difficult to get stuff.  13 levels and she haddent gained the<br/>
&gt;respect for items that you get over time.  It is sad.  She is bored, and<br/>
&gt;feeling useless.  Actually I have talked her into creating a bard :) and <br/>
&gt;she<br/>
&gt;is building up from scratch with no twinks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok Im not talking about giving a tarnished weapon to a 1st level char.  No<br/>
&gt;Im talking about giving someone somthing that they will be stuck with for a<br/>
&gt;very very long time.  Change is good.  And on top of this.  My poor Druid<br/>
&gt;friend, has been using a 2 handed blunt bloodforge for 13 levels, never<br/>
&gt;switching weapons.  Now she is stuck, and worried about switching to a<br/>
&gt;weapon she has never used.  Wow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I dont get it.  Perhaps im a little jaded because I have been looking for a<br/>
&gt;Bronze Breastplate for the last 2 weeks with no luck.. But I dont think its<br/>
&gt;all that.<br/>

I twinked the hell out of my newbie druid (I should have waited because of <br/>
the short corpse decay rate..dying and having a server go down would mean <br/>
losing all the good stuff if I was unable to get back in time - fortunately <br/>
it didn&#39;t happen). He is now lvl 22 and better equipped than some 50th level <br/>
druids I meet. BI medallion, crown of leaves, foreman tunic, gatorskin legs, <br/>
runed falch, charred shield, plat armbands, etc etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
At low level, having an observer staff or runed falchion DRASTICALLY <br/>
improved my survivability with mobs up to a point. This to me enhanced my <br/>
playing experience. =) All the mana items gave me an edge, and I enjoyed it. <br/>
I&#39;ve been a newbie so many times that it gets tiresome worrying about every <br/>
fight. I also don&#39;t kite, so the equipment really helps there as well. =P<br/>
<br/>
The reason I twinked is I have camped all this stuff before and did not look <br/>
forward to doing it again. I won&#39;t mind doing it if someone in my group <br/>
needs one; my already having the item and not needing it lessens the <br/>
frustration of watching placeholder after placeholder spawn and die, and <br/>
through all this knowing that I&#39;m usually not going to get my turn to loot <br/>
any time soon. Course this depends on the camp.<br/>
<br/>
As far as looting goes on my primary (bard)- I have a group of friends that <br/>
I hang out with nightly. We are a good mix of people and we determine loot <br/>
order based on who needs what. I almost always place myself at the end of <br/>
the list for items because most items I want are melee-based, and my warrior <br/>
friend really could make better use of them than myself. My primary (bard) <br/>
is so decked out (full mithril, dual ykeshas, etc) that the only gear he has <br/>
to look forward to is Imbrued Plate which looks urine colored if ya ask me. <br/>
If we loot an item no primaries need, we move on to secondaries, and the <br/>
rest is lottoed to do with as you please. I normally will give loots i <br/>
receive from lottos to friends, my guildmates, or any newbies I happen <br/>
across who could use it. I rarely ever trade or sell anything.<br/>
<br/>
My secondary only loots random mobs if he is soloing. Non-twinked people who <br/>
group with me love it because I don&#39;t need nor want any loots.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any problem with twinking unless you are playing your primary, <br/>
and you are trying to short another player&#39;s needy primary on loot just to <br/>
twink your secondary. For example, a friend of mine was camping a Ghoul <br/>
Lord, and the group&#39;s Cleric INSISTED he get the next Ykesha or he would <br/>
ditch. The cleric KNEW my friend (a bard) was in the order to receive a <br/>
Ykesha, but refused to let him have it first or he would leave. Normally <br/>
they would say &quot;then just leave&quot;, but at 6AM high level clerics are not <br/>
always on hand to fill the gap.<br/>
<br/>
As far as not experiencing the thrill of getting that new item for the first <br/>
time..I got news for ya, at high levels you will probably have been <br/>
everywhere and camped pretty much everything. Get it over with while you can <br/>
- just be fair and don&#39;t place your secondary char&#39;s looting &quot;rights&quot; over <br/>
someone else&#39;s primary. =)<br/>
