		How about this, big guild quest, our leader has died,<br/>
		and to resurect him the guild goes to the far ends of<br/>
		Norrath to collect pieces for a ressurection spell.  I<br/>
		was holding the final, crucial piece after a week of<br/>
		questing.  I was in High Hold Pass, the meeting was an<br/>
		hour away, so I start burning towards Lesser Fey with<br/>
		the final ingrediant.  After the zones, the boat trip,<br/>
		running throung Greater Fey, all the guildsay is<br/>
		bascially &quot;is he here yet&quot;.  I&#39;m blazing, I look down<br/>
		to grab my drink, I look up and I&#39;m leaping from the<br/>
		top of the wizard gate at full speed.  This was back<br/>
		before high level clerics where running around all<br/>
		over the place.  The guild decided to go ahead without<br/>
		me, as I was bound in HHK.  I was soooooooo mad.  Now<br/>
		it seems funny, but man...<br/>
