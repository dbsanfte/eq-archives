<div id="ygrps-yiv-319165435">I agreed with all but this point.  It&#39;s time to put Voodoo cards to bed.<br/>
They don&#39;t support 32 bit graphics (and even the new Voodoo5 spec isn&#39;t<br/>
going to.  They will run as fast but the color depth just won&#39;t be there.<br/>
In short, the folks at 3dfx need to get it in gear and quit resting on their<br/>
laurels...  16bit color is nice but with every new NVidia chip supporting 32<br/>
bit (and soon 64 bit color I suspect) 3dfx is going to wind up getting<br/>
dusted even worse than they are right now by the GeForce.  If you&#39;re running<br/>
a Voodoo card I&#39;d recommend, when you do upgrade, that you go to an NVidia<br/>
chipset or a Bitboys chipset.<br/>
<br/>
Your mileage may vary (but in this case unless something rather significant<br/>
happens over at 3dFX they&#39;re going to wind up hurting badly.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There is still a noticeable improvement of the GeForce over a TNT 2<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Up to the buyer:  $300 (yes I know you can get them for around $230-$260<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well) now and $400 later this year?  Or stick to what works now and just<br/>
&gt; pay<br/>
&gt; &gt; $400 later?  The advantages of the GeForce are great.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; an AWESOME card.  But I would recommend doing some pretty extensive<br/>
&gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of the GeForce (or any 2nd gen card)  before I<br/>
&gt; run<br/>
&gt; &gt; out and buy it.  3rd Generation cards are just around the corner.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; OH:  For the hard core Gamers:  If you get a Gig system:  Don&#39;t get one<br/>
&gt; &gt; based on Intel&#39;s i820 or i840 chipset, get either the VIA FBS 133<br/>
 </span></blockquote>chipset<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; with 133 SDRAM or get a BX 440 chipset and overclock the board to 133mhz<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; use SDRAM 133.  You will get FAR better performance out of the Intel Gig<br/>
&gt; &gt; system on those Mboards and your games (IE:  EverQuest) will run a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; better.<br/>
