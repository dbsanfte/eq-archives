&gt;  of my bard.  I&#39;ve seen L45-50 bards not know the first thing<br/>
&gt;  on how to play one.  But they have mostly Mithril, FBSS, and<br/>
&gt;  two ykeshas, so that must make them badass (read: twinked).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;d rather have some nice magical instruments<br/>
&gt;  than try to pretend to be a warrior mini-me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL - you really meant 45-50th bard for those items? Those items fall within <br/>
those level ranges and are very acquireable by a NON-TWINKED bard at lvl <br/>
40+. Only thing I&#39;m missin is FBSS, but i&#39;m in no rush because my melee <br/>
output is not all that important, obviously.<br/>
You want to see twinked, inspect my secondary.<br/>
