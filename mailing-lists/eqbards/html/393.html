<div id="ygrps-yiv-742343170">Your concerns really struck a nerve with me and I&#39;d like to share some of my<br/>
observations about life as a bard.  As mentioned in  previous reply, we<br/>
bards are actually very good soloists.  When things get hairy, we have the<br/>
accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In the situation you<br/>
described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot, I&#39;d hit accellerando at<br/>
about 3 bars of health.  This is because you slow down below 2 bars and you<br/>
may need that extra bar to get some distance between you and the orcs.<br/>
Always have accellerando hot-keyed.<br/>
<br/>
Second, lament is a great spell but it can, as you have learned, fail.<br/>
However, the lower the level of creature is compared to you, the more likely<br/>
it is to succeed.  Never use it on a white or higher con.  It will fail way<br/>
too often.  But, if they all con green or a low blue, you could solo a camp<br/>
and clean it out.<br/>
<br/>
Third, our greatest power is in grouping, but grouping is risky.  It is a<br/>
high-trust situation.  Be very careful who you group with and guage how well<br/>
you can trust them.  I might group with a group like you had described, but<br/>
I would not trust them to save my butt if I got in trouble and at the first<br/>
sign of trouble, I&#39;d run.  Only when they have shown that they can be<br/>
counted on to keep me alive when the going got rough would I let myself get<br/>
low in health.  I die more frequently in a group then solo because I am<br/>
still too trusting and eager to jump into danger to save someone whose<br/>
stupidity got them into trouble... usually failing and dieing along side of<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Be up front with them about this though.  Make sure they understand that<br/>
since you don&#39;t know them well, and your life is dear to you, you will do<br/>
what you have to to protect it until some trust and teamwork has developed.</div>
