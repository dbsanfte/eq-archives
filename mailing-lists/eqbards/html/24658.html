<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998169826">I&#39;ve had deaths with corpses in the wrong spot - especially after linkdeath<br/>
(could be crazy AI when you&#39;re linkdead) or whatever.  Assuming they don&#39;t<br/>
think you&#39;re not being truthful I&#39;d expect a guide would summon your corpse<br/>
out if you have problems with the CR<br/>

...fighting giants in FM the other night, I dinged 32.  About 3 or 4 kills<br/>
later, I go linkdead.  I&#39;m in a full group, there is another full group just<br/>
down the wall from us.  I figure I&#39;m pretty safe, right?<br/>
<br/>
I get back on after my cable modem stops having fits, and I&#39;m at my bind<br/>
point, back to 31.  I only grab a drum out of the stash.  I won&#39;t need<br/>
invis, right?  The giant fort is well camped, and my corpse will be just<br/>
inside, right?<br/>
<br/>
Hehe...wrong!  I get back to the spot, and it&#39;s nowhere in sight.  I pulse<br/>
in a locate, and of course, it points me deep into the fort.  I never<br/>
noticed the cave in the back.  In I go.  Oh, there it is, about halfway<br/>
down.  How the heck did I get there!  When I went LD, I was standing by the<br/>
wall whacking a giant!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.<br/>
