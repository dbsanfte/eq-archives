I think it may well apply to more people than you think. It certainly<br/>
applies to me. I have been playing my bard on Mith Marr almost exclusively<br/>
since day 1 of the commercial release, and am now only 18th level despite<br/>
playing almost every day. I don&#39;t play for more than an hour or two,<br/>
typically, occasionally three or four, and I have noticed in that time that<br/>
some of the people I have played with in the past are now level 50, but the<br/>
larger majority of them are still around my level, or at least within 5<br/>
levels or so of me. So, this leads me to believe that there are more of<br/>
those who are in the situation where a death really does mean the end of<br/>
your effective playing for the evening. I know that is my case, and it seems<br/>
that if I have more exp when I log than I did when I started, I am beginning<br/>
to consider that a darned good night. Mostly since I started hunting in<br/>
Unrest, though! :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, more casual, time limited players who are in this situation, are less<br/>
likely to read and post to the EQ liasts, thus they are not heard from.<br/>
I know I would love to get bind, simply for the fact that it would make the<br/>
game more enjoyable for me. <br/>
<br/>
And, for those who would like more challenge, simply do not purchase the<br/>
song, and for you, nothing changes.<br/>

i understand your position, i just don&#39;t know how many people it applies<br/>
to.<br/>
i actually am enjoying this discussion, i like debating intelligently,<br/>
without getting TOO offensive =)  and damn it really got this list<br/>
going, i<br/>
haven&#39;t even been able to read the other posts like the bard letter to<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; true but it has obviously been a small percentage of your <br/>
&gt; actual playing<br/>
&gt; time as evidenced by your levels.  Your lowest level <br/>
&gt; character probably has<br/>
&gt; more playing time than my highest.  Dying for me doesn&#39;t just <br/>
&gt; mean running<br/>
&gt; across some zones and back to playing.  It often means <br/>
&gt; running across some<br/>
&gt; zones and quitting for the night. </span></blockquote></div>
