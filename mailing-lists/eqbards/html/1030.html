&gt;<br/>
&gt;General call for the following information:<br/>
&gt;1) Are there currently any bards using any two-handed weapons (slashing or<br/>
&gt;blunt)?<br/>
&gt;2) Are there any Bards who have had any luck with advancing their<br/>
&gt;hand-to-hand skill, and if so, how, and how far?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This was brought to my attention by someone who pointed out that, although<br/>
&gt;we have the skills listed on our &quot;training sheet&quot; we can&#39;t actually train<br/>
&gt;any two-handers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is correct.  Our max skill in 2h is 1.  We have 2h skill simply so that<br/>
GM bards can utilize the special GM items (locator staff, etc.)<br/>
This is what a friend of mine who guides on some server told me.<br/>
