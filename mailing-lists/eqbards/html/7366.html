&gt;     Ok, this is how it&#39;s done (I&#39;ve never personally done this btw).<br/>
&gt; When you teach another PC, their skill goes up to your skill + 1.  So<br/>
&gt; what you do is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)  You teach the other person, until their skill is maxed (i.e., it<br/>
&gt;     becomes your skill + 1)<br/>
&gt; 2)  The both of you zone (to update the skill list, like, if you get<br/>
&gt;     trained in a language up to excellent, you have to zone before it<br/>
&gt;     shows up as excellent)<br/>
&gt; 3)  The other person now has your skill + 1, so he teaches you (to his<br/>
&gt;     skill + 1, which is your skill + 2)<br/>
&gt; 4)  Zone<br/>
&gt; 5)  Repeat<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eventually you&#39;ll max it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks to all who posted this method.  It&#39;s a lot faster (and cheaper) <br/>
than the method I had imagined (which had to do with starting newbies and <br/>
using their skill points, with a large cash infusion).  I figure it would <br/>
take about 2-4 hours to raise from one point on one person to excellent <br/>
on both (depending on zone load time, intelligence and attention level).<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to note that it should, then, be possible to tag-team two (or <br/>
more) languages at once, for example:<br/>
<br/>
Person A trains Person B in Language 1 for two skills<br/>
Person B trains Person A in Language 2 for two skills (simultaneously)<br/>
<br/>
Then zone and switch languages, repeat, then zone back and switch <br/>
languages...<br/>
<br/>
In fact, you should be able to train up to six languages at once (one for <br/>
each grouped member), although odd numbers would be hard to keep track of <br/>
 (since you would need to cycle the languages, rather than just switch <br/>
back and forth).  Still, it shouldn&#39;t take that much longer to do <br/>
multiple languages.  Anyone on Innoruuk want to try it?<br/>
