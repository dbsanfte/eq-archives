&gt; levitation bug<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; A high level magician friend of mine gave me a summoned ring of levitation<br/>
&gt; (whatever it is actually called) so that we might make the trip through<br/>
&gt; nro<br/>
&gt; and oasis a little less painful (i.e. taking 30-40 points falling damage<br/>
&gt; while using accelerendo going up and down the dunes.)  When I right<br/>
&gt; clicked<br/>
&gt; on the item to activate the spell effect nothing happened. When I stopped<br/>
&gt; playing Accelerendo and tried again, it worked fine, and I resumed playing<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s without a problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later I had some cast enduring breath on me, and when I tried to resume<br/>
&gt; levitating I encountered the same problem, but now since I could not drop<br/>
&gt; enduring breath, I was stuck on the ground.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this a known problem with item spell effects not working when you<br/>
&gt; already<br/>
&gt; have spell effects active, or could it possibly point to something that<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; changed in the levitation code or general spell behaviors and may be<br/>
&gt; showing<br/>
&gt; up as a bug now?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any info would be helpful,<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Broken Song<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt; &gt; first allow me to introduce myself.  I am new to this list, but not a<br/>
&gt; new<br/>
&gt; bard nor a new player to Everquest.  I currently have a 31st level Bard on<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk, Rosha.  I have been playing him since March 26th, just not in a<br/>
&gt; hurry to level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, with the latest patch, I have noticed a problem with the level<br/>
&gt; 31<br/>
&gt; song, the levitate one.  Now when I play it, it starts, I rise, I get the<br/>
&gt; message I feel as if I am about to fall, followed by You are already<br/>
&gt; floating.  This repeats for 2 cycles.  Immediately after the 3rd cycle of<br/>
&gt; the song, I then fall to the ground, the icon disappears.  On the next<br/>
&gt; cycle, it all repeats.  It does this even if twisting, so it seems to me<br/>
&gt; that it now only allows continuos levitation for two song pulses.  I did<br/>
&gt; just acquire this song, so I don&#39;t profess to be an expert, however, it<br/>
&gt; did<br/>
&gt; not function like this prior to the patch.  Just a word of caution using<br/>
&gt; this song now, and be on the lookout for other changes!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
