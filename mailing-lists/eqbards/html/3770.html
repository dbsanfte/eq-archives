&lt;&lt;  I was actually trying to<br/>
 learn if anyone had figured out the staff segment quest in<br/>
 Highhold, and did a double take when I saw &quot;lute&quot; and &quot;gypsy.&quot;<br/>
 :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this where the quest starts ? or in neriak ? just where is that fixed <br/>
location?  ( me and some higher lvl friends are going to try to get that mask <br/>
and i want to screw around ) i&#39;m really loving how things seem to be <br/>
connected.  get to a level and get the mask. go start the quest, progress a <br/>
little more and get the lute. etc etc. its neat how it works out,,hehe i&#39;m <br/>
babbling.</div>
