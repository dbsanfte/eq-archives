<div id="ygrps-yiv-740959611">Alright the mage thinks to themselves, I need a nice safe place to meditate.<br/>
Hm, this bridge here should be safe.  When folks train the really tough<br/>
monsters like that big Proon, they&#39;ll most certainly bring him this way.<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ll sit down right here, because I can be most certain this is where<br/>
Proon will be standing angrily when the fleeing person is gone.  And I will<br/>
have no time to even stand up before I&#39;m dead!  Perfect!  Oh that rivershore<br/>
nearby is far too safe, Proon might not see me, completely unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot believe the angry shouts from these people, angry they were not<br/>
warned Proon was coming.  Dumb people.<br/>
<br/>
Today was the first day I actually quit a group and actually informed them<br/>
it was because they were such a bad group.  Usually I am more discreet,<br/>
because the bad players actually try to be good players, and may learn one<br/>
day.  But this group, from their idiotic banter, to their actions, arrgh!<br/>
They got me killed by all four, not just one, the whole dullard lot of them<br/>
chasing after a hurt monster, happily slashing away.  Meanwhile the bard is<br/>
left to fend for himself!  Not only that, I was stacking Hymn and Anthem...<br/>
with another bard in the group, playing... of all things, Accelerando!<br/>
During battle!  He told me he was playing it because we might have to flee.<br/>
For the whole battle, he plays it, for when we flee.....  &lt;&lt;rolls eyes&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think bards may have a bad reputation by the dumb people who like just one<br/>
song, likely the entire basis of their class-choice, and play this song even<br/>
at the innapropriate times!  This fool-bard also mentioned he was twinked so<br/>
heavily because he sold crack.  &quot;Only the gods can help me now!&quot; I thought,<br/>
and they didn&#39;t.<br/>
