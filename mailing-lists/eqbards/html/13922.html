<div id="ygrps-yiv-952769098">I am posting this as I need some info/help to obtain the Gypsy Lute for the<br/>
Lambent BP Quest.<br/>
<br/>
Last night me (35 bard), 50 monk, 40 Mage, 35 Druid and 35 Paladin made our<br/>
way to the music room by having the monk pull, he could pull things solo,<br/>
we eventually held the music/piano room, that was until the monk pulled<br/>
about 10 things.<br/>
<br/>
 I somehow managed to run from the music room and make it to the zone with<br/>
about 20 hp&#39;s left. The Paladin died the monk FD&#39;d and the casters gated.<br/>
Druid failed the evac as he was getting a beating.<br/>
<br/>
I had to go after this and never got the chance to get a lute, although I<br/>
got the black silk gloves (in case you don&#39;t know, I am getting a friend<br/>
full Lambent in return for a Yak). All I need to know is was I in the right<br/>
place to get the lute, who drops it and is it a rare drop?<br/>
<br/>
Many Thanks<br/>
