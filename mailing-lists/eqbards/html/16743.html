<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083024039">Heya guys...<br/>
I was wondering if you could tell me some very basic strategies on<br/>
using our songs in groups and solo.<br/>
<br/>
I am about to hit level 8 so I dont have a lot of them, however what I do<br/>
is start off by singing the str/dex song you get at lev1, then once its<br/>
started<br/>
I start up my regeneration song, then I start whistling the ancient warsong<br/>
(lev 7)<br/>
<br/>
then I keep rotating between em to keep them going, and so far it seems to<br/>
work<br/>
nicely for me.  I will occasionally add in the lev 2 song that makes the<br/>
enemy &quot;wince&quot;<br/>
but its kind of dangerous and Im never sure if its helping much anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What are some tips I can look forward to using at future levels?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, well...I was gonna ask about some weapons...but Ill put it in another<br/>
mail to keep this thread pure.<br/>
