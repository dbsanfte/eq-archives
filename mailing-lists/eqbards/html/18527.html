Guilds stealing players.<br/>
<br/>
This term makes no sense to me.  How do they steal a player?  DO they<br/>
sneak into your guildhall in the middle of night, creep into DuckFoo&#39;s<br/>
room, hold a nocked Ashenwood bow to his head and tell him to leave?<br/>
<br/>
No?<br/>
<br/>
They convince DuckFoo that joing their guild is better for him than<br/>
staying in his old guild.  DuckFoo then decides that the gains for<br/>
joining the new guild outweight the loyalty he holds to old guild.<br/>
<br/>
Wheres the problem here?<br/>
<br/>
Its with DuckFoo or with his old guild.  Either DuckFoo is leaving<br/>
behind good friends, and trustworthy companions for the allure of more<br/>
power.  Or, his old guild was not providing him with what he wanted from<br/>
a guild.  In the first case I say &quot;Shame on DuckFoo, and you deserve<br/>
whatever happens to you.&quot;  In the second, I&#39;d say its a good thing<br/>
DuckFoo left and everyone is probably better off.  I don&#39;t see where the<br/>
new guild has done anything wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t getting from a guild what you want, then you should<br/>
leave.  All the better if its to a guild which will give you what you<br/>
want/need.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I want to be in a guild with people I like and I&#39;m friends<br/>
with.  Hopefully also with a decent amount of people my level, so I can<br/>
more esaily find groups.  Other people may want other things.<br/>
