I really do think there is something to your theory.  I&#39;ve run<br/>
right through aggressive mobs and not had them aggro on me.  <br/>
Personally, I think it&#39;s a function of faction, range, and<br/>
duration.  I know for a fact that the time it takes something<br/>
that /cons &quot;threatening&quot; to attack you depends on your<br/>
faction.  Lynuga /cons &quot;threatening&quot; to me, and almost<br/>
immediately attacked the first time I tried to hail her to see<br/>
if I could do the ruby quest.  Next time I hit her with the<br/>
Charisma song.  She was still &quot;threatening,&quot; but I spent about<br/>
5 seconds approaching her, hailing her several times, then<br/>
leaving, all without being attacked.  Later, I forgot to hit<br/>
her with Carillon first and was immediately attacked again.<br/>
