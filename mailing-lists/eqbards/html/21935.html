<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101625525">Uh, soon as you hit them they wake up, and most weapons swing twice in<br/>
between pulses.  This isn&#39;t really very effective unless the newbies are<br/>
missing a lot.<br/>

Get 2 level 40 bards singing at the bridge of blackburrow and catch all the <br/>
trains and allow all the newbies to kill away. So yea, no benefit to the <br/>
bard, but it would be a way to mess up play balance in a dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Though I totally understand. You would expect a level 30 bard should be <br/>
able to mesmerize level 1 mobs with 95% accuracy. It&#39;d just be sad to see <br/>
people abuse such power. Don&#39;t you hate always having to play to the lowest <br/>
common denominator? People have (and will continue) to crow about ways that <br/>
they broke the game. Hilarious though it may be.<br/>
