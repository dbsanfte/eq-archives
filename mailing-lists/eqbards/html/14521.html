<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391084061">I noticed it quite some time ago - but for the most part - it was a low<br/>
enough amount that it never really became much of an issue.  I haven&#39;t been<br/>
watching closely if it got worse with the last patch.<br/>

&gt; I hate to say this.. I mean I REALLY hate to say this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone noticed that stamina is now draining from us while running with<br/>
&gt; Accelerando?  I was just running through SK and found my stamina bar<br/>
rapidly<br/>
&gt; decreasing.. I have never seen that except when running and jumping, or<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; out of food/water.  Can anyone tell me if I am alone in this or did they<br/>
&gt; nerf Accel while &quot;extending it&#39;s range&quot;<br/>
