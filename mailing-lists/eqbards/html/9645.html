<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721013602">Just a tip.. not everyone is able to get a bind at the Arena every time that<br/>
they want one. So do not go blasting those that were not able to get a bind,<br/>
or willing to wait 3 hours to get a bind.<br/>

Well it was bound to happen sooner or later - I finally met an EQ player<br/>
with no scruples whatsoever, an Enchanter of 27th level on Fennin Ro.  After<br/>
taking and holding the Alligator hallway in Lower Cazic-Thule, my party was<br/>
doing pretty well pulling gators from both ends of the hall.  We had a mixed<br/>
bag party with no healers save me and a Ranger.  We had a 30th Rogue though,<br/>
so things were going well.  Eventually our magician leaves, so we&#39;re only<br/>
four now.  A Ranger, Rogue, Enchanter and a bard.  We decided to go ahead<br/>
and try and hold the spot.  Well we got a bad pull of three gators from the<br/>
Rogue, and a couple of resists of the Enchanter and we all were slain.<br/>
Well, we chalk it up to a bad pull and decided to do our corpse recoveries<br/>
and try again.  The Enchanter is the first back to his corpse of course,<br/>
followed shortly by me.  The Ranger and Rogue are running from Freeport so I<br/>
loot my corpse and am waiting with the Enchanter in the hall.  Well for some<br/>
reason a gator agros on the Enchanter.  I start pounding on it so it turns<br/>
on me.  The Enchanter tells me to stop as he&#39;s going to Mem Blur it.  I<br/>
stop.  The gator continues chewing on me as the Enchanter tries a couple of<br/>
casts.  Another gator happens upon us at that moment and joins in with the<br/>
first gnawing on my leg.  With no warning whatsoever the Enchanter gates.<br/>
I&#39;m standing there alone in the gator hall with two level 30 gators double<br/>
hitting me in the 30s and 40s without even having auto-attack on.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
have lullaby memmed because there was an enchanter in the group, so my only<br/>
option is to run for the zone.  Even starting at half health I managed to<br/>
zone out with about 20hps left (thank you Selo).<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, this guy is now on my short list of folks never to group<br/>
with again.  I disbanded immediately after the guy didn&#39;t even deny having<br/>
used me as a distraction.  He only said &quot;They were resisting.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
wanna die again.&quot;  The other thing that I learned is that when I&#39;m in pickup<br/>
groups I should always have some sort of personal protection song memmed<br/>
like Screech - a word from the just-a-bit-wiser.<br/>
<br/>
SIDEBAR:<br/>
Why don&#39;t people realize that it&#39;s THREE zones to Cazic from Arena and SIX<br/>
zones to Cazic from Freeport??  Is there swimming skill just so low that<br/>
they don&#39;t want to swim Lake Rathe?<br/>
