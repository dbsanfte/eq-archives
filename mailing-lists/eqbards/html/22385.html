<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964743948">I won&#39;t switch out weapons, but I will switch out instruments (easy once you get the hang of it) for the DOts (one target, drum and two chants with horn and 18th song....more then two targets, then 1 chant and Chords with mandolin and 18th song with brass).  I love how much faster I can kill something with my DOTs then with my Yaks.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you all have played on test, there&#39;s a new feature that I&#39;m hoping will be patched in tomorrow.  10 hot key banks of 10 hot keys each...now I can keep all my instruments and songs on one hotkey bank :) (though I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do with the other 90 hotkeys :).  There&#39;s also 10 banks of socials (IIRC).<br/>
