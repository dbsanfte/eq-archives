<b>Subject:</b> First Time Bard Sightings <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-355185267">Now, this story is not about the first time I saw a bard, but rather<br/>
the most memorable. The first time I saw a bard was when I exited my<br/>
guild, singing the new song they had just taught me. That was the first<br/>
time I saw a bard. A most memorable bard sighting of mine was back a<br/>
few songs ago, maybe six or seven. I was hunting cats and spiders with<br/>
a group of friends in West Commonlands. At the time, I was singing one<br/>
of my newer songs, helping my friends heal. Then, a gleam in the<br/>
distance caught my eye. I thought it was the sun at first, but it was<br/>
way too small. It came at me at the highest speed, faster than my<br/>
Accelerando had ever carried me. It appeared to be flying over the<br/>
hills of the commonlands. Suddenly, it was close enough for me to see<br/>
what it was. It was a bard, like me! He obviously was much more<br/>
advanced than I was. I knew that from listening to a song still foreign<br/>
to my ears. I vowed that one day I too would gain that ability.<br/>

2 more things. We have since found out that bards&#39; spells get<br/>
additional effects at higher levels. So, it was not my video card.<br/>
Second: Roop, I just read about the tournament thing you are having. It<br/>
is an amazing idea, and wish that I could join. Perhaps one day,<br/>
Cazic-thule will see its like.  <br/>
