&gt;I agree with the other comment, you should probably be<br/>
&gt;meditating while testing this.  Also, immediately after the<br/>
&gt;test you should cast a spell that takes a known amount of mana<br/>
&gt;in bubbles, to see if there is any phantom mana effect that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;making it appear as if you have more mana than you do.<br/>

I tested it with a lvl 50 wizard and a clock.. we used ice comet and what <br/>
ever to dump his mana to zero twice. I started the timer and sang jig o <br/>
vigor with MM Battle drums no less, then repeated with him jsut sitting and <br/>
meding.. and i tell you.. lvl 50.. full mana regen.. omg we took a full hour <br/>
just doing this... anyhow.. both times were within 10 sec... so.. this is <br/>
prolly just error on our part in not being perfectly exact.. but 10.. at lvl <br/>
50.. that is no diff at all.. its a total shamm<br/>
