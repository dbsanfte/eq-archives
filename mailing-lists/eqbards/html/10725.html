<br/>
I think this is my first post in this group so figured I should say hi first<br/>
=)<br/>
<br/>
Not that I will get some any time soon with my bard but I would think of it<br/>
as being beer stained =)  I know my bard is gonna be a master brewer and be<br/>
partying all the time... and from personal experience I know after I have<br/>
had a few too many I tend to spill a lot =)  Granted I have only seen<br/>
screenshots of the armor and they are always darker then in the game... but<br/>
I would much rather have beer stained armor then urine stained armor =)<br/>
<br/>
Zylin drunken Wood Elf Bard of 12 songs<br/>
Azerin 39th Dark Elf Necromancer<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is a great list... much better then the other class lists I am on,<br/>
I have gotten a lot of useful info so far, even though most of the bard<br/>
specific stuff I can&#39;t use yet.<br/>

<br/>
yeah, cute;)<br/>
We already get the worst Armor color in the game (A real bard would not wear<br/>
Armor that looks Urine stained) and to top it all off, it is the most rarely<br/>
dropped now;)<br/>
Good job Verant crew!<br/>

So I guess the fact that supposedly not one piece has been found since<br/>
the PoH patch by anyone on any of the servers is just some odd<br/>
coincidence of the random generator.<br/>

&gt; BARDIC PLANE ARMOR<br/>
&gt; I just double checked with the dev team to try and resolve this and have<br/>
&gt; been informed they have extensively tested this and the Bard armor is<br/>
&gt; dropping on public servers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Guess it&#39;s just ultra rare. At least Maestro always has a prsent for them.<br/>
