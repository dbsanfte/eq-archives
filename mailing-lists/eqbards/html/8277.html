&gt; that&#39;s ridiculous.  I have dual wield at 17th, close to the level it starts<br/>

&gt; that it hits for all of that 10% of the time.  Even a first level monk with<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Doh.  You&#39;re right.  I forgot the skill starts off at the<br/>
level you get it rather than at 1.  So a L13 warrior has a<br/>
dual wield cap of 65 or 70, not 5.<br/>
<br/>
Still, even 10% will only improve a 2/35 weapon to 2.2/35 (or<br/>
2/32).  Nowhere near 6/28.<br/>
<br/>
Try this.  Find a level 13 warrior and a nonmagical mob that<br/>
he can reasonably solo (about the same difficulty as a wisp).<br/>
Then have him punch it to death.  That should settle this<br/>
argument.<br/>
<br/>
(Btw, dual wield for monks is really funny.  Their cap is<br/>
something like lvl*5+50.)<br/>
