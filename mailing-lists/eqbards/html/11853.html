+ Lullaby.  It&#39;s close though - straight Lullaby, stopping and<br/>
starting it after each nods message is almost as good (my chr<br/>

chances of a critical failure (GIBs get several spells off for<br/>
max damage on the same person in succession) make the first<br/>
method better.  ER and GR keep the spell damage to a minimum,<br/>
and the one shot of Lullaby sometimes does keep 1-4 GIBs<br/>
asleep for a bit (yes, we&#39;ve done all 5 at once many times).<br/>

Since their spells seem to be cold based, I need to try ER +<br/>
Lullaby + Lullaby some time.  The one bad thing about having a<br/>
Mistmoore drum is that you prefer ER to Psalm of Warmth (both<br/>
have the same cold resist boost if you use a normal drum with<br/>
ER, but a Mistmoore drum makes ER better since Psalm is sung).<br/>
If they provided equal cold resist, it&#39;d be clear that I<br/>
should jump in with my weapons, or use a lute with Lullaby.<br/>

Either you should get a resist message, or the mobs should be<br/>
affected by it.<br/>
