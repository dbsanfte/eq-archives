 </span></blockquote>Amen to that. I love the monster slaying part of EQ, mainly the teamwork<br/>
part, as a good group of well played characters is the most fun I&#39;ve had<br/>
in the game, but I miss the socializing part of UO a lot too. I probably<br/>
spent as much time hanging around the bank in Britain chatting with<br/>
friends and meeting new ones as I did in the dungeons. Come to think of<br/>
it, I probably spent more time in town than out in UO.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t, however, miss the backstabbing by random strangers part of UO.<br/>
I hope someday someone creates a game that has the best of both these 2<br/>
games in it. I think they&#39;d have a real winning game.<br/>
