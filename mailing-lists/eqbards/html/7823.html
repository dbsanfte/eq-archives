&gt;At least on our server, the GM&#39;s have told us that using that way in to<br/>
&gt;do a Vox raid would be considered an exploit. They do have a huge agro<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, but THIS I don&#39;t understand.  Now they want to say that using a<br/>
DIFFICULT TO ACCESS &quot;secret entrance&quot; is an EXPLOIT!?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so, using invisibility to sneak past an aggro mob should be an<br/>
exploit, and so should using your sword if the mob doesn&#39;t have one.<br/>
<br/>
Good ghod!  Is there no end?!  If I hear so much as a breath of something<br/>
this inane on my server, I will probably sign off.  For good.  That&#39;s just<br/>
too far, I&#39;m sorry.  If they didn&#39;t want the hole to be there, they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have built it.<br/>

*sheesh*<br/>
