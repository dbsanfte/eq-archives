<div id="ygrps-yiv-342700923">I have heard the same information about the Pugius, and i have seen them for<br/>
sale on my server (Prexus).  I have been in unrest (not alot) and have also<br/>
never seen a Lesser Blade Fiend, nor have i seen any info about the fiend on<br/>
any guide to unrest that i have looked at.<br/>
<br/>
As far as good Piercers go, I prefer to use the Mithril Quill with my Dragoon<br/>
Dirk.  It is also really spiffy for us bards (as we are to-hit challenged)<br/>
because it can only be used by bards and the 4 int-based casters.<br/>

I think this is a great weapon for those that cannot afford Claws.  As I am on<br/>
Prexus, where the dungeons are mostly empty, Claws are not available for<br/>
Purchase as they are on some of the older servers.  I find the Mithril Quill to<br/>
be a more than ample replacement.  I was just irritated that it was Primary<br/>
Hand Only, because i had another one in the bank for when i hit 17, but oh<br/>
well.<br/>
