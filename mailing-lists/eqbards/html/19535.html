<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061241686">Go to the gobbie mines!  Once you aget to about 27 or 28, you should be able to solo nicely til 30 or 31.  Hit the top corner of the Sarnak fortress for 32 and 33 (follow the path until it ends, then goalong the wall to the flat area near the 2nd level of the fortress).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I was running around in Lake of Ill Omen at one of the undead areas.  In a<br/>
&gt;matter of around 4 hours I had managed to gain almost 3 full bubbles of xp<br/>
&gt;which was enough to get me into level 25.  This was with a group of a Necro,<br/>
&gt;a shaman, 2 druids and 2 bards.  The shaman and one of the druids seemed to<br/>
&gt;know nothing about healing and the shaman eventually left.  So now I have<br/>
&gt;just a tad over 3 bubbles until Fear!!<br/>

&gt;My guild mates who are a tad higher level than me (45-48) prefer to hunt<br/>
&gt;Hornets in Burning Wood - but I seem to attract them like flies on<br/>
&gt;(you-know-what) and seem to die at least once every attempt - so I leave<br/>
&gt;them to that while I get &quot;Pick-up&quot; Groups (in quotes because it&#39;s become<br/>
&gt;pretty regularly who I&#39;ve been grouping with) at the North Wall...<br/>
