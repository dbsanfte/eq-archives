<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Some thoughts on grouping from another list: <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-911139415">Ok the absolute WIERDEST group I&#39;ve ever been in was:<br/>
<br/>
Karnor&#39;s Castle:<br/>
<br/>
Bard (me)<br/>
Necro<br/>
Druid<br/>
Warrior<br/>
Paladin<br/>
Monk<br/>
<br/>
We absolutely RULED the zone.  We went all the way in and were having the<br/>
time of our lives.  None of us could believe how well we were doing without<br/>
a cleric but, point of fact, we just didn&#39;t need one.  With the Druid<br/>
hitting everyone with pack regen and me using lute songs with Hymn up we<br/>
were barely getting hurt in  most fights and the few times we did get hurt<br/>
the paladin and druid were more than able to keep up with the dmg we were<br/>
taking.<br/>
<br/>
When the necro split we picked up a Wizzy and kept right on going.  Downtime<br/>
was minimal, if any, both Druid and Wizzy were nuking for the most part and<br/>
I handled any crowd control needed.<br/>
<br/>
Fun fun fun!<br/>
<br/>
Another group I never thought would make it was:<br/>
<br/>
Paladin<br/>
Ranger<br/>
Rogue<br/>
Rogue<br/>
Bard<br/>
Shaman<br/>
<br/>
We absolutely destroyed anything that got near us.  Ranger and I split<br/>
pulling duties.</div>
