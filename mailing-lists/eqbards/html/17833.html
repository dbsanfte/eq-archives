 </span></blockquote>A couple of weeks ago I had a similar occurrance, and yes, I believe I<br/>
was taking damage at the time.  I was in Crushbone, being hit by the<br/>
Emmissary I believe.  I backed into the zone line and as I zoned, I<br/>
found myself falling off a platform in Kelethin, on the south side,<br/>
quite far from Crushbone.  My fall knocked me unconscience (I was<br/>
already quite hurt), but thankfully I survived.<br/>
