Clerics.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh?  Impossible quest armor?  To get the boots you have to kill... nothing<br/>
all it requires is time.  To get the gauntlets you have to kill...<br/>
Babbinsbort, please.  I have already killed him twice at 21st level in a<br/>
group where I was the highest level there at 20.  Greaves, kill Maugrim.<br/>
Yay, he&#39;s tough, killed him in a level 19-21 group.  Hint on both the<br/>
previous two (get a bard, they have a very hard time when everyone has an MR<br/>
over 100).  The bracers are a pain.  Not that hard really to kill Zahal,<br/>
just a lot of running need a ranger&#39;s help.  The shield isn&#39;t that hard<br/>
either, Glacial Bear and Mino Sentry are not that tough.  In fact so far<br/>
none of these mobs are as tough as the hill giant or griffin you have to<br/>
kill for every single piece of bard armor.  The only cleric armor pieces<br/>
that might be impossible are the ones that require you to kill a heavily<br/>
camped spawn, and I bet you could get some of those for free from someone<br/>
wanting the Kedge totem for example.<br/>
There may not be other cleric only weapons, but there are other items that<br/>
are cleric plus a few others that are very handy.  The Shining Star of Light<br/>
is the best weapon in the game at least until 15th level or so.  Having<br/>
cleanse as a proc means never worrying about Poison or disease, etc. from a<br/>
mob.  They sell regularly for 75pp while Dirks never go above 40pp, go<br/>
figure.<br/>

&gt;Thats the price you have to pay for playing on an aged server.  Dirks are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>everywhere &gt;due to a flooded market when Dvinn used to drop<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it everytime.  If you were on a new server, you wouldn&#39;t be seeing a Dirk<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or Screamer &gt;until the mid to high teens.  Many of the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;people that played at the start used those weapons well into their 30&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Problem is I was on the serve within a month of its startup.  I still got a<br/>
dirk at level 12 by helping kill Dvinn.  I also got a Screaming Mace by<br/>
doing the quest and helping kill Crush for the tunic at level 12.  Also got<br/>
my own tunic immediately afterwards the same way.  You could get either of<br/>
these in a good group at level 12-16, but then your next weapon that is<br/>
better is level 25+?  That makes little sense and is not true for the other<br/>
melee or hybrid-melee classes.  except maybe Rogues, not too sure what stuff<br/>
they get.  I agree many have done this keeping those things until 30th, but<br/>
with new quest weapons and such it is only true now for a few classes or<br/>
non-questers.  Maybe my group will break down and go Mucktail hunting and I<br/>
will upgrade to a PGT if I win the lotto, but it certainly isn&#39;t 200pp<br/>
better than my dirk.  I just don&#39;t understand why they leave out levels<br/>
16-25 for some classes to get better equipment and not others unless its<br/>
because they only cater to their own internal class interests.<br/>
