Pay what you want, lambent stones sell for 3pp in the shop.  It is<br/>
a major waste of my wizard&#39;s time to sell these for 10-20pp to people,<br/>
when the average HG drops 30pp, why waste 10 minutes moving through zones<br/>
trying to sell for only 7-17pp gain, I could just kill another HG.<br/>
<br/>
You have to remember, people that are looting lambent stones are usually<br/>
level 30-45, and most of them don&#39;t consider it worth their time<br/>
to sell an item to a player for 20pp.<br/>
