<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130367206">Ubiq (UWOO designer) hates grief PKers with a passion.  As a result, he is<br/>
placing increased importance on creating a system that punishes them<br/>
harshly.  <br/>
<br/>
I think jhenders was correct in that developers realized that EQ with PvP<br/>
switch was commercially more successfully than UO with rampany PKing.  But I<br/>
think they also know that many EQ players (like me) would play a PvP game if<br/>
there was a strong punishment for PKing.  So from a business perspective, it<br/>
is in their benefit to develop such a system.  And thats why all the 3d<br/>
generation MMORPGs are leaning in that direction.  Like I said earlier it<br/>
remains to be seen if their solution actually works.  May take the 4th<br/>
generation of MMORPGs before they finally get it right.<br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone would be against PvP without the grief players, well<br/>
almost no one.  If anybody can figure out how to get rid of the grief PK&#39;ers<br/>
they will have one heck of a game on their hands.  It&#39;s sort of the holy<br/>
grail of MMORPG&#39;s since long ago in the days where MUD&#39;s were all there was.<br/>
<br/>
One point they are taking at Horizons that all the others have ignored is<br/>
this.  They don&#39;t care if the anti-grief PK solution they implement is<br/>
unfair.  In fact they hope it so grossly unfair as to make grief PK&#39;ing<br/>
rapidly get to the point of you log in with your PK&#39;er, you die.<br/>
