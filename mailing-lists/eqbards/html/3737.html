<div id="ygrps-yiv-808455820">Heh... thanks for the suggestions but here is what I have already<br/>
experienced with the following in the past....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Elite orcs in crushbone - CB is heavily camped at all times making anything<br/>
 </span></blockquote>worth fighting at my level impossible to get to, or fairly deadly since they<br/>
bash and stun fairly frequently.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Elite gnolls in blackburrow - These are indeed blue to experience giving<br/>
 </span></blockquote>greens, but again, heavily camped... last night I got chastised for killing<br/>
one that was just standing around while the party that chastized me killed<br/>
something else two rooms away.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Nobles in paw (exceptional loot) - Last time I was there this area was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>badly camped as well but I havent been back for quite a while.  Worth<br/>
checking out again, thanks. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Mammoth calves in everfrost - Tried this.  The calf brought me to 2 bubbles<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of health before I killed it and I got no noticable experience from it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Elephant calves in south karana - Haven&#39;t tried this but I suspect it would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be the same story as the Mammoths.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Lion patriarchs/matriarchs in east karana - All the ones I have seen have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>been green to me....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Beatles (borer?) in north karana - I tend not to spend much time in North<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Karana as those damnable griffons scare the socks off me. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Alligators in oasis - Not too tough, but even less xp gain than the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mammoths as far as I could tell, and again the area seems to be almost<br/>
constantly camped.<br/>
<br/>
I do thank you for the suggestions though... I may well try those beetles<br/>
and I have been thinking of going back to Paw so you confirmed what I<br/>
believed was true in that.  Thank you for the help :)<br/>
