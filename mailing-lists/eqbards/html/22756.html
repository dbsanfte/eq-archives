<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428165360">Ladt night while camping the orc oracle in Eastern Wastes (near the bridge),<br/>
we had 3 of those nifty earrings drop (we were pulling cougars, griffs, etc)<br/>
and a *very* rare drop from the oracle, a necklace that was like AC 8 (or<br/>
was it AC 5?  Think it was 8), +3 str, and +2 dex.<br/>
<br/>
Loot is nice and randomized :o)<br/>
<br/>
Will prolly strike out on my own tonight (just under a bub and a half from<br/>
level) and try charm-kiting those roaming giants ;o)<br/>
