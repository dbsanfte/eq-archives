&gt; my younger years, I remember when Lullabye was useful too.  I also remember<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve numbered the successful nods.  As you can see, there are<br/>
5 of them.  Not to mention 10 mobs in the area of effect.<br/>
<br/>
What Verant changed was limit the number of mobs that would<br/>
simultaneously attack you.  Only 4 mobs will attack you at<br/>
once.  Others that have aggroed on you will either not move<br/>
(thus staying out of range), or not attack (if they are<br/>
already in range), or if there&#39;s another target they&#39;ll attack<br/>
that instead.  As a result, it&#39;s more difficult to get more<br/>
than 4 mobs within range of a song at once if you&#39;re alone<br/>
(it&#39;s really easy if you&#39;re grouped or in a crowd of players).<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve seen, I also think if none of the mobs are<br/>
actually attacking you (i.e. you&#39;re outrunning them), then<br/>
there is no limit to the number of mobs that can chase you.  <br/>
But once they get within attack range, you&#39;ll only get<br/>
attacked by four at a time.<br/>
