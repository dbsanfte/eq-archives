<div id="ygrps-yiv-270126235">I wish my guild was as large and high level as yours; we are a great group<br/>
but smaller.  We normally have just under 20 total on a busy night; have a<br/>
wizard who just hit 50 last week; a couple in the 40&#39;s; myself and about 5<br/>
others in mid-to upper 30&#39;s...<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to the future when the majority advance high enough to do<br/>
stuff like this.  Thanks for the info Sylly!<br/>

&gt; level 50 clerics make the world of difference in your confidence.  And for<br/>
&gt; us, it was a great &quot;fun&quot; event for everyone to be involved with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yes, the scenery there is some of the very best in the game.  It is by<br/>
&gt; far one of my most favorite zones.<br/>
