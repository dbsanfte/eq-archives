<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081489734">Are you sure it wasn&#39;t the Stiletto of the Bloodclaw she was selling? Those<br/>
often go for 200 plat. At the CZ Bazaar last night, Dirks were regularly<br/>
going for 50-60 plat. Even though it is a regular spawn in CB the one thing<br/>
you have to deal with that makes it &#39;rare&#39; is waiting in line to pop Dvinn I<br/>
would guess.<br/>

8)&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve seen it advertised from as low as 10pp to 100pp.  The big<br/>
8) difference between the dirk and other special weapons is that<br/>
8) the mob who carries it spawns often, and has it every time.<br/>
8) It is going to cause a serious realignment of prices for<br/>
8) weapons in the L15-25 range.  I personally wouldn&#39;t pay more<br/>
8) than about 15pp for one, maybe 20pp if I were in Qeynos &gt;&gt;<br/>

8)     Heh... I was in West Commonlands yesterday and someone<br/>
8)was selling the<br/>
8)dirk.  She wanted me to make the first bid and laughed at 50<br/>
8)plat.  She said<br/>
8)the lowest she would go would be 120 plat.  In fact, a<br/>
8)guildmate said he&#39;s<br/>
8)seen them go for over 300 plat... I guess I&#39;ll pick one up<br/>
8)when I&#39;m in<br/>
