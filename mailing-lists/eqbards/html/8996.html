<b>Subject:</b> Lullaby secret nerf? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-21053321">Earlier this week there was a thread discussing how Pixie Strike was broken.<br/>
In one of the posts, someone also mentioned that Lullaby didn&#39;t seem to work<br/>
as well either.  Last night in Unrest I had a first hand experience that<br/>
leads me to conclude Lullaby has either been secretly nerfed or<br/>
unintentionally broken.  <br/>
<br/>
I was grouped with a 30+ cleric and a 30+ bard.  We were camping in the<br/>
basement to try to get the bracelet off a greater dark bone.  We got into a<br/>
pickle and headed for the zone with a train following.  All three of us<br/>
zoned, healed up, and zoned back into Unrest to try to get the greater dark<br/>
bone before he returned to the basement.  We got the GDB but also pulled a<br/>
barbed bone skeleton.  I started to sing Lullaby so we could focus on the<br/>
GDB and keep the barbed bone out of the fight.  All three of us were<br/>
attacking the GDB.  When Lullaby pulsed, I always put the barbed bone to<br/>
sleep (he never resisted).  Sometimes the GDB would resist but since we were<br/>
attacking him it didn&#39;t make a difference.  However, the barbed bone<br/>
skeleton kept attacking me for the entire fight.  At no time did he ever<br/>
just stand there asleep.  Often, the attack would occur immediately after I<br/>
got the &quot;head nods&quot; message.  I had a similar experience with Lullaby<br/>
earlier last week while in Cazic but last night was the first time I paid<br/>
serious attention to it.  Because Lullaby was not properly working, I was<br/>
forced to zone to avoid dying.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest everyone test Lullaby when you get the chance to confirm if you<br/>
are experiencing the same thing I did last night.  Request that you submit a<br/>
bug report if you have similar results.  <br/>
