&gt;Date: Sat, 15 Apr 2000 04:39:00 -0400<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thanks for the support all :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s clear to me now (as a few have posted here and elsewhere) that since<br/>
&gt;the humblest haste item maxes out our speed, melees who could get the full<br/>
&gt;speedup from the uber haste items should have priority.  so i&#39;m a firm<br/>
&gt;believer now that dragon/god haste items should go those without a haste<br/>
&gt;song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;of course, we still need an fbss or swirlspine still.  sadly the guild<br/>
&gt;still<br/>
&gt;thinks since we have a haste song, it&#39;s a waste to let the bards wear a<br/>
&gt;fbss/ssbelt.  (tho this may have changed.  there are only a couple bards<br/>
&gt;left in the guild at dragon/god level.  there used to be enough to put a<br/>
&gt;bard in every group.)  because of the guild rules this would only happen<br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;us if we joined pickup groups at frenzied, with no guildmates that could<br/>
&gt;*cough* use it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s a moot point for me now anyway.  i left the guild.  i never really<br/>
&gt;thought it&#39;d happen.  these are my friends, not people to help me gather<br/>
&gt;loot.  leaving over this issue would&#39;ve been foolish.  but it was pretty<br/>
&gt;clear in the discussion that too many in the guild think we should make<br/>
&gt;useful chars instead and only dig out the bards at large targets, where<br/>
&gt;we&#39;re actually useful.  and what a god-awful burden it was getting us <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;but they&#39;re still my friends, so i won&#39;t say the guild&#39;s name :P<br/>

Subject: Re: ugh, shutting bards out of lotto getting more widespread<br/>
<br/>
get a new guild<br/>
<br/>
find out up front what the loot rules are - before you join<br/>
<br/>
tbh, bards at high levels dont need haste items.  on really big stuff, you<br/>
do not want to be a melee person.  you will contribute best to your team<br/>
with your songs enhanced by your instruments. but you do need to feed<br/>
yourself on a day to day basis and you will still spend your time outside<br/>
guild events swinging swords so you do have a legitimate use for haste<br/>
items.  so, if your guild was saying that the up front melee people need<br/>
haste items first, i would agree with them.  then your problem is that in<br/>
such a large guild, there will always be someone in front of you. <br/>
 although,<br/>
you should be able to field a group to go camp for a sash in guk.  but<br/>
taking you out of the lotto entirely is pretty bad.  i&#39;d be looking for a<br/>
new guild (although i&#39;d never have joined or stayed in such a large one<br/>
anyways.)<br/>

&gt; tonight i found out that no longer will bards in our guild be allowed on<br/>
&gt; lotto for haste items, ever. (unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>
&gt; different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; any ideas?<br/>

Subject: Shard procs<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night, my guild held a promo/FFA event for our members and <br/>
recruits in the Arena (the zone).  All folks engaging in the event were <br/>
told to un-mem any DoT spells/songs, and leave any weapons that proc DoT&#39;s <br/>
either in the bank, or unequipped.  Seeing as I was the organizer, I left <br/>
my beloved Kisch in the bank (-=sigh!=-) and whooped out the ol&#39; Obsidian <br/>
Shard.  The Shard (from all I have read is SUPPOSEDLY a simple 30pt DD <br/>
proc. right?  Well, imagine my suprise when a few ticks (not sure hopw <br/>
many) after it procs, I get the old &quot;The Obsidian Shatter effect has worn <br/>
off&quot; message.  Question:  Was there an update to this weapon that I missed? <br/>
 (haven&#39;t used it in over a month)<br/>
btw... No matter what Abashi says, Necro and Bard fears STILL work in the <br/>
Arena&#39;s PvP zone, and in a Duel(he even replied to a post of mine about it <br/>
saying they disabled it).<br/>

Much as I&#39;ve enjoyed using it, I can attest to it&#39;s power, and perhaps<br/>
overpower.  In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd control.  Whenever<br/>
two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second, command it to /pet<br/>
guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a ways away, and<br/>
reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>
enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>
clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>
<br/>
However, I heard through the grapevine of a bard on another server who<br/>
charmed the Key Master in the airplane to attack Sirran the Lunatic.  The<br/>
lucky bard took such a faction hit that he is now scowling to all quest<br/>
NPCs in the zone.<br/>

&gt; &gt;i wish i could find it but i can&#39;t now, but what i read from a<br/>
guildmember<br/>
&gt; &gt;of mine who says he spoke with some people at verant, is that all of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;PoS<br/>
&gt; &gt;quest items have hidden stats that are not shown, so even though the<br/>
stats<br/>
&gt; &gt;may look bad, you are far more effective wearing any PoS item than not.<br/>

Subject: A theory on clarity<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had the opportunity to play a shaman recently (level 49), and noticed<br/>
that mana/health regens at 6 second (&quot;tick&quot;) intervals.  At first I<br/>
thought Cannibalism to be inefficient, but after discovering this I found<br/>
timing the stand -&gt; cast -&gt; sit pattern between ticks, I could use both<br/>
effectively (med and cann).<br/>
<br/>
I believe clarity (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus) puts a &quot;clarity counter&quot; on<br/>
everyone in the group.  When the tick occurs, the counter is removed and<br/>
additional mana is granted to the holder.  This would explain why it is<br/>
possible to weave one other song in addition to clarity without diluting<br/>
it&#39;s effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about this topic because I don&#39;t like the common ideology<br/>
of &quot;direct mana addition per pulse,&quot; when starting/stopping the song<br/>
doesn&#39;t add anything over simply singing it straight (despite the doubled<br/>
number of pulses).  The big question, of course, is: Will the Cantata of<br/>
Replenishment stack with the Chorus of Clarity?<br/>

Subject: Lord Grim: aLive and Undead in South Karana<br/>
<br/>
Sylly spent the weekend camping Lord Grimrot.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Why bother?  Well, old Grimmy drops stuff that you need for the Aegis of <br/>
Life, a Clr & Ppal only, AC 12, +10 wis +25 sv Disease, 1 charge Superior <br/>
Heal.  And it can be equipped in your back slot making this a very <br/>
desirable cloak - heh.  The Grimmer is a long spawn (maybe 3 or 4 times in <br/>
real time 24 hours for the live version and my guess is once per 24 for the <br/>
dead version.) You need his scythe (common) and his heart (uncommon.)  He <br/>
drops 2 scythes, both lore, one is no drop.  He spawns in 2 versions: live <br/>
lev 35-39 highly magic resistant human SK or lev 25 undead skel form. <br/>
 Sometimes you get 1 live, sometimes 1 undead, sometimes 1 live and 1 <br/>
undead at the same time, sometimes 2 lives, and of course sometimes 2 lives <br/>
and 1 undead.  And he has a large agro range.<br/>
<br/>
For 49 levels, I saw this guy maybe 2 times - ran past him to zone on the <br/>
stone bridge after he bashed me good.  Now in the past month, I have been <br/>
in nearly 10 Grim kills.  Solo&#39;d him one time when I met him on the bridge <br/>
- he was at half health and I nearly died and I was 48 or higher.  The rest <br/>
of the kills have been with at least a co-level of higher cleric.  At 50 <br/>
both me and the cleric, get knocked to about half health before he dies. <br/>
 He is a meanie!  The undead version is lots weaker.  One time, I had <br/>
Ghanex Drah charmed and was killing skellies when the undead Grim spawned. <br/>
 Heh, my pet died but so did Grim.<br/>
<br/>
And now for the kicker, you need insanely high faction to complete the <br/>
quest.  Like highest of all the highs.  It&#39;s pretty funny to see my DE <br/>
Cleric friends turning in bones, gold, rabid pelts, etc etc to get their <br/>
factions up but somehow they manage.  Heh, what is this dark elf doing in <br/>
the Temple Of Life talking to clerics and paladins?!?!?  Rumor has it, this <br/>
has been changed on test server and the faction it takes will be high but <br/>
not as high as it is now.  And then there will be a flood of campers??? Who <br/>
knows.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, my high elf Clr friend got her shield this weekend and my DE Clr <br/>
got his parts and is finishing his faction.  And a 3rd just needs a scythe. <br/>
And we met a couple more who are in the process.  When I dinged 40 and the <br/>
last blue avo turned green, I thought that was the end of my long hours in <br/>
South Karana - heh guess not.  Got to see the Pegasus 2 times over the <br/>
weekend for the first time ever.  No sight of GrizzleKnot nor Coloth <br/>
Meadowgreen (who I owe a couple deaths to.)<br/>

The last efreeti raid I went on was at 48th lvl.  At that time I decided to<br/>
test lament to see how well it would stick.  So I memed it and tossed it<br/>
into my battle weave.  at 48 with an unbuffed cha of about 115 I was <br/>
getting<br/>
resisted about 40% of the time.  I am itching to try it now on a single<br/>
party break in to Efreeti :)<br/>

The Obsidian Shatter Effect has these properties:<br/>
1)  DD 30 DMG<br/>
2)  DEBUFF:  -10 AC for approximately 6 heartbeats (Tics)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a DoT, but it is a Debuff.  Therefore you will get the message <br/>

Hmm, I was buffed and in charisma gear for charming so my charisma was <br/>
about<br/>
190 or so.  Bet that would help the Lament resist rates :).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I only got one resist on my charm the entire break in... Not bad :)<br/>

&gt; The last efreeti raid I went on was at 48th lvl.  At that time I decided<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; test lament to see how well it would stick.  So I memed it and tossed it<br/>
&gt; into my battle weave.  at 48 with an unbuffed cha of about 115 I was<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; resisted about 40% of the time.  I am itching to try it now on a single<br/>
&gt; party break in to Efreeti :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Much as I&#39;ve enjoyed using it, I can attest to it&#39;s power,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; overpower.  In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd<br/>
&gt; &gt; control.  Whenever<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second,<br/>
&gt; &gt; command it to /pet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a<br/>
&gt; &gt; ways away, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I finally feel like my old level 30 self again.  This weekend I led an<br/>
&gt; &gt; Efreeti run.  On the third pull someone wandered off a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; too far and<br/>
&gt; &gt; agroed 2 Lava Guardians and 3 Imps right after we had<br/>
&gt; &gt; finished off an imp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Our enchanter went OOM after the first of the 3 remaining<br/>
&gt; &gt; Imps fell leaving<br/>
&gt; &gt; me to crowd control alone.  Using Charm on one of the imps, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep both imps busy while we were able to finish off the lava<br/>
&gt; &gt; elementals and<br/>
&gt; &gt; then the imps with no further casualties :).  From that point<br/>
&gt; &gt; forward, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter and I had it worked out so that I would charm the<br/>
&gt; &gt; extra incoming<br/>
&gt; &gt; in each pull and keep them busy while he mezzed singles.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would then tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; him when the charm broke so he could start mezzing my pet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This had the<br/>
&gt; &gt; nice effect of keeping the imp pounding on me instead of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter until<br/>
&gt; &gt; he could get the mez to stick as well as giving us an extra<br/>
&gt; &gt; hand in battle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We repeated the process every time mez broke as well with<br/>
&gt; &gt; great success.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The enchanter barely took damage the rest of the break in and<br/>
&gt; &gt; used a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; less mana.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was EXTREMELY tempted to attempt pulling for this raid...<br/>
&gt; &gt; I really wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt; to try out a combination of Lament and charm to pull on these<br/>
&gt; &gt; to see if I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could really control the pulling better then the monk.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; the end I went<br/>
&gt; &gt; with traditional break in techniques but I&#39;m not so sure the<br/>
&gt; &gt; traditional<br/>
&gt; &gt; break in is the best way to go anymore.  Have any of you<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried Lament on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Imp or Lava guardians or been the puller for the Efreeti<br/>
&gt; &gt; raid?  If Lament<br/>
&gt; &gt; would work, I really think that a single well balanced party<br/>
&gt; &gt; of 6 might be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to handle the break in alone.... :)  If none of you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried it, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think I might go for it next weekend...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, 2 Efreeti in the first 3 spawns and then we were shut<br/>
&gt; &gt; out with only<br/>
&gt; &gt; place holders for the next 10 hours...<br/>

Ogre guards INSIDE Oggok is rarely dull or boring and easy to justify as a<br/>
role player and there really isn&#39;t any place in the game for better XP at<br/>
level 45...  Positioned down at the bank area or PoD, you&#39;ll have a minimum<br/>
of 5 spawns plus wanders and there are plenty of challenges to keep you on<br/>
your toes.  It&#39;s not your typical break up the spawn and med in between<br/>
scenario like most guard killing is.<br/>

Hmm, SS room already?  That is prime xp territory. I love to get guild<br/>
groups there. Where will you go at 48,49, & 50?  For 45, 46, 47,and to 50<br/>
even, I killed alot of spectres - mostly solo (I&#39;d say 80-90% of my 45 was<br/>
&#39;solo&#39; - ie ungrouped helpers at times buffing & healing but one heck of<br/>
alot of fear/chaining.)  Until 47, single pulls are hard unless the spots<br/>
are heavily camped.  Oasis, Feerott & OOT are the prime spectre spots.<br/>
Soloing them is a possibility at 45 but risky.  With a partner, should be<br/>
quite easy.  Another partner spot is Cyndreela outside the TV in the PoF<br/>
cave (but that is like guard camping except you fight a caster instead of a<br/>
melee class. Kill, heal/med, rinse, repeat.)  Other wise, outside <br/>
Permafrost<br/>
Ice Giants,  OOT seafury cyclops, rathe mts hg&#39;s, Lower Guk King Room, <br/>
Ghoul<br/>
Lord Room, Frenzied. Kedge Keep with ppl who know what they are doing and<br/>
the correct classes but this is an unlikely pickup group spot.<br/>

Subject: Plane of Sky Update<br/>
<br/>
Well, the weekend is over, and I spend almost all of it in the Plane of<br/>
Sky.  This is basically what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Day 1: Cleared Fairies and Azaracks, camped on Gorgalask<br/>
<br/>
Day 2: Cleared Gorgalask and Pegasus, camped on Pegasus<br/>
<br/>
Day 3: Recleared Pegasus, realized it was already 11PM, did some poking<br/>
around on Spirocs and jumped off, leaving a necro and cleric on pegasus<br/>
<br/>
Some spoilers for how we handled pegasus/griffons below, as well as some<br/>
basic info on spirocs.<br/>
<br/>
Of Griffons and Pegasus, Griffons are noticibly easier.  Both of them<br/>
split into two sub 55 red cons&#39;s (tested w/ Bard Charm) which, when<br/>
killed, each spawn another &gt; 55 cons.<br/>
<br/>
The method we use to kill them is fairly simple.  1 group consisting of 2<br/>
warriors, 2 clerics, and 2 enchanters, and 4 melee/cleric groups, with<br/>
pure casters not really helping except with pets.  That 1 group is known<br/>
as the &quot;mez group&quot;.  We kill the first one, and when it splits into 2,<br/>
everyone attacks the same target except for the mez group.  The 2 warriors<br/>
from the mez group attack the other target, tanking it while the clerics<br/>
heal and the enchanters chain cast rune 3.  The bards keep trying to charm<br/>
the first split to give the mez group 18 second breathers.  Meanwhile,<br/>
everyone else kills the other one and the subsequent triggered spawn.<br/>
Finally, everyone kills the remaining spawn that the mez group has been<br/>
tanking the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
Keeper of Souls (the boss) is on par with Innoruuk in difficulty, so not<br/>
too bad.<br/>
<br/>
Spirocs.  All I will say about spirocs is you don&#39;t have to combat drop<br/>
in.  It&#39;s perfectly safe to run around most of the island.  The agro range<br/>
on the spirocs is like 0.1 ft, with the exception of The Spiroc Guardian<br/>
and The Spiroc Lord.  Despite them consing scowls, they don&#39;t generally<br/>
attack unless you run right up to a roost.<br/>
<br/>
We got a ton of drops, just nothing for clerics or bards :(.<br/>
