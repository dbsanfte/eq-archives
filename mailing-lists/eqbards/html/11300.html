Nope, I /bugged and /petitioned it about a month ago when the tags vanished<br/>
over all skeletons.  No response ever to either one.  And the skeletons on<br/>
E&#39;ci still have no tags in any zone I&#39;ve been in.<br/>

Been hunting in Unrest the last few nites.... my first time there. Died<br/>
several times the first nite, due to poor groups - my enchanter husband kept<br/>
telling people which thing to kill (he was mezzing the others), but they<br/>
didn&#39;t follow his direction - but later we got a great group going in the BK<br/>
room, and some higher level friends of ours got a group going in the Knight<br/>
room upstairs and were handy to help in case we got in trouble... And, until<br/>
almost the entire server crashed, we were doing great and having much fun!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same on all servers, but on The Rathe, the<br/>
skeletons do not have a nametag like all the other NPCs. I petitioned this<br/>
(first time I ever petitioned anything), because at one point we were trying<br/>
to fight three or four different skeles, and it was hard to get targeted the<br/>
correct one to fight (and some were having a hard time figuring out how to<br/>
use the assist command...) - but I digress... I basically petitioned that<br/>
the skeles get nametags so they would be easier to target and identify, and<br/>
an assistant got right back to me (I was impressed) and said he understood<br/>
my point and was going to request they fix that.<br/>
<br/>
Now... I was wondering if any of you have gotten such quick response and if<br/>
anyone has ever seen them fix things like that... or if it takes them a<br/>
while to fix things like that... Just curious what kind of responses people<br/>
have gotten, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Safe journeys all!<br/>
