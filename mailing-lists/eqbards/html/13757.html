<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096664196">Problem is I am one of the main tanks for my group about 50% of the time.<br/>
Usually there is me and a monk, or me and a shadowknight, or rarely me and a<br/>
ranger.  Also backing off does no good.  Unless the mob is rooted they<br/>
follow me around like puppies wherever I go.  This makes it more difficult<br/>
for the other tank to melee the mob effectively.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my group was 34 cleric, 33 enchanter, 27 wizard, 26 shaman and I<br/>
still took almost 50% of the damage.  The wizard was the only one able to<br/>
get mobs of me and with her low hp&#39;s can hardly afford to do so.  Tanking<br/>
with a 26th lvl troll shaman was kinda cool, especially since the dwarf was<br/>
the tallest among us, but painful.  Fortunately the cleric was easily up to<br/>
the healing task and even joked about how bards made his job too easy,<br/>
generally only one hp bar to watch.<br/>

Also I did try stopping my songs a couple of times, but it didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
matter.  By that time I had probably cast on the order of 25+ spells to<br/>
anyone else&#39;s 6 or so.  Even doing that much less damage didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
matter.  I guess it doesn&#39;t help that my weapons proc&#39;ed a total of 9 times<br/>
in one fight.  (6 Berserks, 3 Screaming Maces)  Even though the additional<br/>
screams had no effect as I was already buffed I&#39;m sure they still added to<br/>
the hate list.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A bit extreme..  I stop singing all the time to get mobs off me, stop<br/>
&gt; attacking too.  That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t start again in 5 seconds, but if<br/>
&gt; removing myself from the situation for that time puts the damage back<br/>
&gt; where it belongs, it&#39;s worth it.  A wizard needs to know when to stop<br/>
&gt; nuking, a ranger needs to know when to stop taunting, a bard needs to<br/>
&gt; know when to stop singing.<br/>
