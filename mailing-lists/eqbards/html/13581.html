<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915403384">When I logged in Thursday nite there were only 5 servers at less than 1800<br/>
people.  2 of those were the team PvP servers.  Yes during prime time E&#39;ci<br/>
is nearly always 1600-1800.  Unless they let people move characters though<br/>
that won&#39;t change much with added servers.  We still have the same number of<br/>
people on as we always did despite new servers.  Word of mouth promotes EQ<br/>
and friends get on servers with friends generally so the population has not<br/>
declined after any of the new server creations for more than a few days.<br/>

&gt; Ok, that&#39;s not a problem.  First, they haven&#39;t successfully implemented<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; new quests a 21st level bard can do in a very long time.  I&#39;ve tried a<br/>
&gt; couple they did add to see if they might be viable, but both were broken<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t even find out if they were of an appropriate level for me.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; done every other quest, or gotten as far as I could in them, that I might<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; able to do.  <br/>
&gt; On the area of zones.  Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill.  Mistmoore is too<br/>
&gt; deadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too<br/>
frequently<br/>
&gt; to make the entry area safe.  Unrest is packed, last three times I was<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; there were 50+ people in them.  Sol A and Sol B are obviously beyond my<br/>
&gt; groups ability at 21-24.  Haven&#39;t tried Paw since they lowered the<br/>
&gt; difficulty but there was no way before.  Befallen is also fairly crowded<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; most everything there is too low to give me much xp anyhow.  Tried hunting<br/>
&gt; skeletons in rathe but there were too many groups there as well.  Went to<br/>
S<br/>
&gt; Karana but there were 75+ people there mostly hunting aviaks.  <br/>
<br/>
This sounds like you&#39;re on a 1800+ server, and thus a complaint about<br/>
that, rather than not enough places to go. If Verant had stuck to their<br/>
original 1500 max per server (and dispite their denials I remember them<br/>
stating this in beta. They shut down all the servers but one one day and<br/>
asked us all to log in specifically to test if the server could take<br/>
that many) then you wouldn&#39;t have these problems. They now seem to be<br/>
relying on people sticking it out until the expansion when they can hope<br/>
that the current server populations will be more comfortable with the<br/>
addition of the extra zones but personally I think their reluctance to<br/>
put new servers online in a timely manner will hurt them in the long<br/>
run.<br/>
