<div id="ygrps-yiv-861695420">That&#39;s the funny part, no not really.  I guess I just have gotten tired of<br/>
being lied to by Verant.  &quot;Oh yes we test thoroughly, even for bards&quot;  Yet,<br/>
it takes not 2 minutes to prove that the change they put in for Sonorous<br/>
Clouding does not work.  How can the person who is supposed to be the font<br/>
of all knowledge for spells not know how they work?  And if he doesn&#39;t, why<br/>
didn&#39;t he bother to take the time to find out?  Its not like this was an off<br/>
the cuff post to a board at random.<br/>
<br/>
I mean seriously.  What purpose is served by answering our questions if they<br/>
don&#39;t take the time to give the correct answers?  If all they do is tell us<br/>
how something is supposed to work without ever bothering to check and see if<br/>
maybe they made a mistake and it doesn&#39;t work the way they think it does,<br/>
what good does it do?  Its not like this is an isolated incident.  If any<br/>
other entertainment venture repeatedly insulted your intelligence, lied to<br/>
you, and refused to address mistakes, would you still support it?  I doubt<br/>
it.  The NFL is a good example.  The NFL is pretty cool entertainment-wise.<br/>
Would I think so if my representative team was the Cincinnati Bengals?  No,<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be interested any more then either.<br/>

&gt;    Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the<br/>
&gt;       following: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon, Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre,<br/>
&gt;       Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike, and Agilmente&#39;s<br/>
&gt;       Aria of Eagles?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance,<br/>
&gt;       none.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I was glad to see it too - that was one of many questions I submitted. = )<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, too bad its incorrect.  Wind instruments have no effect on the MR<br/>
Debuff of Pixie Strike.  This is a fact known by anyone who has sung Pixie<br/>
with a flute equipped.  Obviously this group does not include any Verant<br/>
employees.<br/>
