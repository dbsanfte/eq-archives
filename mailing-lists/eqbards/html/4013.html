<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919564440">Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed that using a dirk/whip combo and<br/>
twisting anthem and warsong kills a monster faster than using just the weapons<br/>
and bellow/anthem combo?<br/>

&gt; Sure I have read everlore, eqvault, harpers, etc. but as much as I had read<br/>
&gt; what the effects of Anthem de Arms was, I was never able to guage if the<br/>
&gt; weapons speed increase was really working. Part of the problem was that I<br/>
&gt; use a Mino axe, (very heavy, long delay) and most of the people that I group<br/>
&gt; with are also using mino axes, or equally heavy/slow weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I grouped with a rogue double wielding daggers. I have never seen<br/>
&gt; someone hit so hit a mob so many times in my life. It was almost comical.<br/>

&gt; Still being amazed<br/>
