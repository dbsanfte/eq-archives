<div id="ygrps-yiv-990785026">here&#39;s what I used at that level in sol a (modified for an enchanter party)<br/>
<br/>
1) Pixie strike (really good for interupting casters, otherwise let the<br/>
enchanter mez)<br/>
2) Psalm of Warmth (damage shields stack and are always nice)<br/>
3) Anthem (frees up an enchanter spell slot)<br/>
4) Guardian Rhythms (stacks with psalm)<br/>
5) Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain (snaring is vital)<br/>
6) Hymn (for after battle healing)<br/>
7) Angstilich&#39;s Apalling Screech (perfect for clearing out mobs so you can<br/>
zone)<br/>
8) Shauri&#39;s (mostly for travel, although once at a camp spot, I&#39;d often<br/>
replace this with charm)<br/>
<br/>
I always avoid AE spells when enchanters are about, it leads to bad things.<br/>
Also, if you have a druid, let the druid handle the snaring.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little confused as to what song you are referring to when you say<br/>
chains. If you mean Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain, then I feel I have to inform you<br/>
that this is a voice only song and no instrument will affect it&#39;s<br/>
performance.<br/>
<br/>
Strategy wise, let the warrior do the tanking and the taunting, let the<br/>
enchanter do crowd control and stuns vs casters, let the Shaman do the<br/>
healing during battle, you should handle after battle healing and let the<br/>
necro dish out the damage.<br/>
<br/>
Your main role will be meleeing with the warrior and the pet. I would twist<br/>
Psalm, anthem amd guardian vs melee mobs subbing in chains at the end of the<br/>
fights. I would chain sing pixie vs wizzies. Vs shamans I&#39;d mix pixie with<br/>
anthem and sometimes psalm. Screech is a last ditch attempt at getting some<br/>
mobs off your back when you have to flee. Generally with an enchanter you<br/>
won&#39;t really need to charm, however on big pulls it can be really helpful to<br/>
save mana for everyone by letting the mob do the work for you.<br/>
<br/>
Your party has a fairly wide level range which could be a liability for you.<br/>
I&#39;d suggest doing the predator / foreman area for a bit, then move on to the<br/>
singe room ( the room with 3 doors and a secret wall. we usually call it the<br/>
singe room even though singe doesn&#39;t spawn here) After the singe room if the<br/>
shaman hasn&#39;t caught up a bit, try camping the efreeti / captain or maybe<br/>
the bar, but the bar can get out of hand quickly. Once you are averaging<br/>
level 30, I&#39;d head over to the high shaman or the king. The king crack can<br/>
be very tough, especially on a low level healer, so be careful.<br/>

<br/>
I know we recently talked about it but I am having trouble figuring out an<br/>
exact  strategy at 27.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior, 25<br/>
Shaman, 21<br/>
Necro, 27<br/>
Occasional Druid,Mid-thirties<br/>
Enchanter, 29<br/>
Bard, 27<br/>
<br/>
As you can probably guess, our group is put together based on a all being<br/>
friends and not on any strategy (I do plan to get the shaman caught up a<br/>
bit).<br/>
<br/>
The trouble I am having is what to do play given the Enchanter and that,<br/>
given the mix, I should probably be using weapons.  We have been hunting<br/>
Hill Giants but are moving into Sol A and so the rules are going to change a<br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
Anthem is voice, but of course the Enchanter can do the speed buffs.<br/>
DDD, CoD and psalm of warmth are weak with voice<br/>
Chains is weak using voice, and again, the Enchanter can cover that<br/>
Hymn is unfortunatly too weak without the lute to get the mob off the<br/>
Enchanter if she debuffs however, so we are thinking of me singing Chains.<br/>
I can practice charming, which might be fun.<br/>
<br/>
But basicly I have been singing weak DoTs, weak damage sheild and weak Hymn<br/>
to taunt off the Enchanter and feeling like I am being less than optimal at<br/>
my job. Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, pulling Flame Goblin Wizards while playing<br/>
Elemental/Guardian  with the Mistmoore Drum ROCKS, however I have had to<br/>
stop making chains my &quot;tag&quot; song, by the time he shows up I have switched to<br/>
weapons and the other night he droped me from one bubble down to dead with<br/>
no time for a screen refresh...PA_BOOM! Loading...please wait.<br/>
