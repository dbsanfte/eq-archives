<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491069323">I actually noticed it two patches ago ..  as well the Necro&#39;s I know are<br/>
complaining that the<br/>
darkness line is mirroring the problems.  Considered comparing notes with<br/>
Necros on same mobs?<br/>
<br/>
As well using Denon/Chain/Fear .. was noticing the dot come off and chain<br/>
when the mob got into<br/>
any odd pathing (esp. in Kunark).<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Chains resists<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; yes i know this come up after every patch, no i haven&#39;t done any formal<br/>
&gt; testing =)  but has anyone noticed an increase in chains resists?<br/>
possibly<br/>
&gt; from them still tinkering with it?  i can understand the krup frogs and<br/>
&gt; higher giving me problems in sebilis, but the sepsis scarabs and the bok<br/>
&gt; knights and even lower have been resisting chains an insane amount in the<br/>
&gt; last couple days.  i had 2 group members die on 2 different occassions<br/>
&gt; because i could not get it to stick, and have been getting 3 to 5 straight<br/>
&gt; resists very commonly on bok and even lower in sebilis.  this is why i<br/>
&gt; notice.  i have never claimed the &quot;resists are up, the patch nerfed<br/>
&gt; something!&quot; problem before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; on another note, i&#39;d love a definitive answer to this question, as it<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; allow me to start chaining sooner if i am the snarer in the group.  i<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; with a shaman a lot, and obviously the shaman is in charge of slowing the<br/>
&gt; mob.  so, if the shaman slows the mob, and i chain the mob after, will the<br/>
&gt; chain cancel the shaman&#39;s slowdown?  i usually wait til close to when the<br/>
&gt; mob is going to run cause i don&#39;t want to cancel the slow.  if i am not<br/>
&gt; going to cancel it then i can start snaring earlier, since i have recently<br/>
&gt; become accustomed to getting resisted a ton.<br/>
