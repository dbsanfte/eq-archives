&gt; Well, yeasterday while I was hunting in CT. I leveled to 36 (yay!). I<br/>
&gt; did not have my 36th level song, so I was singing EXACTLY the same songs<br/>
&gt; I was before. Anthem, Hymn, Pixie Strike, Chains, Clarity, Etc. I<br/>
&gt; IMMEDIATELY after leveling got 50% more missed notes than before I<br/>
&gt; leveled. I went from Fizzling one in 20 to ~one in 10.<br/>

about August.  Our hunch is (max_skill - current_skill) plays<br/>
a role, whether intentional or not (stupid if it is<br/>
intentional).  I never did get a chance to test it though, as<br/>
I was in my first hell level and it dropped off my radar by<br/>
the time I reached 31.<br/>
