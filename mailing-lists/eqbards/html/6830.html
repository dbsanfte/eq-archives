<b>Subject:</b> What to do with a level 24? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032927040">I have been on extended business travel since June.  This has kept my playing down to an average of once every <br/>
other weekend.  My (obsessive) friends are, needless to say, a bit ahead of me now.  Level 40 at the minimum,<br/>
which makes it impossible to group with them anymore.  So I&#39;ve been reduced to attempting to solo, or trying to <br/>
beg my way into random groups.<br/>
<br/>
One soloing story:<br/>
<br/>
I decide it might be fun to solo Broon at level 22.  Doesn&#39;t really work well, so I make a run for it.  Almost <br/>
to the zone, and Broon starts to hit me from behind.  After much desperation, I find that the program thinks I <br/>
am sitting down.  Sadly, I figure this out just a little late.  I&#39;m now level 21.  POed, I decide to kill some <br/>
of those crag spiders in the Karanas to get my level back.  I kill one, but am unable to get healing on before <br/>
the poison kills me.  I kill a second, but am unable to get healing on before poison kills me.  I kill a third, <br/>
 manage to get healing on, but his brother hits me from behind.  I give up and go kill crocs in Oasis. <br/>
<br/>
One random group story:<br/>
<br/>
The first time I go to Cazic, I get grouped with five other players, including two(!) Clerics.  Cool!  Two <br/>
hours later, I have died three times and have spent half my gametime running back from Freeport.  I should have <br/>
asked earlier, but in my state of disbelief I had not yet done so, but I decided to politely ask the Clerics <br/>
where the (bleep) their healing was.  Cleric A:  &quot;I&#39;m a Battle Cleric, I don&#39;t cast healing&quot;.  Cleric B:  &quot;I <br/>
like to reserve mana so I can heal the party quickly after the battle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My experience in Cazic (and elsewhere) is that, at my level, I have five choices:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Solo for experience, which is VERY slow.<br/>
2.  Group with a COMPETENT healer (MUCH easier said than done)<br/>
3.  Stand around twiddling my thumbs while the group fights, and heal them later.  They don&#39;t like that much.<br/>
4.  Sing songs and run when I&#39;m getting whacked (which means that I am always out of zone when the experience <br/>
is earned).<br/>
5.  Sing songs and die.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions about where to go to earn solo experience at my level (24)?<br/>
Does anyone have any tactical suggestions to permit me to keep my butt alive when grouped with mediocre <br/>
players?<br/>
<br/>
I hate playing for eight hours and earning only one bubble of experience.  Or less.<br/>
