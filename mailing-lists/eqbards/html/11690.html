&gt; Sometimes I wonder if Verant even reads the messages players send in.  I<br/>
&gt; think every player in EQ knows that mobs higher level than you have a<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; chance at resisting spell/song effects compared to mobs lower level than<br/>
&gt; you.  No where in Jason&#39;s letter did he mention his tests were against<br/>
&gt; higher level mobs.  At least he did say the testing department is checking<br/>
&gt; it out.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci  (crossing his fingers that the testing department is not<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; bad as we think it is)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I don&#39;t think that he meant mobs higher level than you, I think he<br/>
meant just plain higer level.  As in, level 30 mobs have a better chance to<br/>
resist a level 30 bard than a level 20 mob has of resisting a level 20 bard.<br/>
If this is the way it&#39;s meant to be, lullaby would definately come out of my<br/>
playlist very soon.  It barely works at 28.<br/>
