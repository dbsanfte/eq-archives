<div id="ygrps-yiv-596769904">Not to argue semantics, but if all bard songs cause<br/>
mobs to hate us and we are the only class that has<br/>
songs, doesn&#39;t that equate to bard hate?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you were playing any song at all (even Selos is a<br/>
&gt; buff), then the<br/>
&gt; monster put you on his hate list.  If the other<br/>
&gt; group was fighting multiple<br/>
&gt; mobs and only dealing damage to one (as they<br/>
&gt; probably should), then the<br/>
&gt; other mob could easily be pulled off by your song. <br/>
&gt; Once the mob jumped<br/>
&gt; you, you started playing your songs the best you<br/>
&gt; know how.  Anthem or Heal<br/>
&gt; or whatever song you play is not only pulsing on<br/>
&gt; you, but also on every PC<br/>
&gt; around you.  While your songs don&#39;t affect PCs not<br/>
&gt; in your group, they<br/>
&gt; still put you on the hate list for the mob (and<br/>
&gt; faction adjustments).  If<br/>
&gt; you are surrounded by your group and the other<br/>
&gt; group, the mob sees you<br/>
&gt; buffing 12 PCs.  Nothing will get the mob off you as<br/>
&gt; long as you keep<br/>
&gt; playing your songs like this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And there are also other factors that can make you<br/>
&gt; believe in &quot;bard hate&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Zones are buggy.  Songs can go through walls,<br/>
&gt; unlimited z-axis, and<br/>
&gt; sometimes all the way to the other side of the zone.<br/>
&gt;  And many zones have<br/>
&gt; pathing problems.  You may be affecting mobs and not<br/>
&gt; even know it.  Five<br/>
&gt; minutes later, the mob may have finally found a way<br/>
&gt; to you.  It will run<br/>
&gt; past other people who are not on it&#39;s hate list<br/>
&gt; until it gets to you.  You<br/>
&gt; might not have even been playing your songs for<br/>
&gt; several minutes.  Of course<br/>
&gt; you will think that it is Bard Hate, but there is no<br/>
&gt; such thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is a bard&#39;s song that cause monsters to attack,<br/>
&gt; not just being a bard.<br/>
