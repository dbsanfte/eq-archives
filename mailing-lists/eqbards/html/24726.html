<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618821003">My charisma is 128, and I still see lots of resists.  I hate charm kiting.<br/>
At 32, I&#39;ve tried charm kiting the cyclops, and I always end up zoning<br/>
either right after or right before killing one of them...heh<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably my technique, but still...I stink at it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I LOVE being CC in a group.  :)  Especially when I juggle<br/>
more than one between charm and mez...  So much better than the same old<br/>
&quot;twist & melee&quot;.  :)<br/>

Hmm, I&#39;m not exactly sure what my cha is, but I&#39;m pretty sure its under 125,<br/>
and I dont have too much trouble messing something.  I SUCK at charming,<br/>
find it annoying and frankly not worth the time and effort (or the healers<br/>
mana).  But messing seems to work fine, can keep 2 things off pretty<br/>
reliably and still manage to sing haste.  However if I&#39;m in an area where<br/>
I&#39;m getting high resists I usually just suck it up, sing haste, regen and<br/>
nivs and try to mitigate damage.  But thats just me, maybe I need to learn<br/>
the right way to charm.<br/>

&gt; I agree but that it doesn&#39;t ruin charm kiting, just makes it more<br/>
&gt; difficult. I hate reaching over to the F8 key in between <br/>
&gt; selo, restoration<br/>
&gt; and re-targeting pet. Just one more finger stretching operation. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would be tempted to mez more but I fail too often at 105 <br/>
&gt; CHA and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to lose the AC to get it to &gt; 125. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone tried singing the CHA song before mez? I wondering if that<br/>
&gt; would help get mez to stick without switching gear in between <br/>
&gt; chanters.<br/>

&gt; BTW, I tested charm kiting some frost giants (in velious) and didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really have much of a problem at all. After charming a frost giant<br/>
&gt; captain, I had him attack a frost giant savage. I restarted selos&#39;,<br/>
&gt; retargetted my pet and waited for charm to break. Then I re-charmed my<br/>
&gt; pet, pressed my &quot;target nearest npc&quot; key, and hit <br/>
&gt; my &quot;/pet<br/>
&gt; attack&quot; social while backing away to stay out of melee range.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Worked like a charm.<br/>
