I talked to Vlad of Avatars of Doom on Karana awhile back. He<br/>
said should like J.C. said, they&#39;ve made the planes extremly<br/>
hard now. Creatures backstabbing for 400 damage when you try<br/>
to portal in. Getting hit can teleport you to other parts of<br/>
the zone. He did mention before they made it impossible to get<br/>
it about some of the armor. Hopefully he&#39;ll send it on in as<br/>
well as the rest of his guildmates. Paladin armor is blue.<br/>
Cleric armor is purple. Bard armor is yellow. Druid is green<br/>
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>
chain. Ranger is green plate. Shaman is grey (not sure).<br/>

Yellow?  Why yellow?  I feel a barrage of coward jokes and<br/>
have-a-nice-day jokes coming...<br/>
