The Plane of Fear<br/>
<br/>
First of all a map is always nice.  Here are two possible sources of Plane<br/>
of Fear maps: <br/>

TERMINOLOGY crack - this is the time while killing the 15-18(number is<br/>
debatable) patrolling mobs. /q - quitting out of the game, if a mob is not<br/>
agroed already and you /q, you will not be agroed camp - sitting down and<br/>
actually camping out scare tower - a structure close to the SW corner that<br/>
contains typically 3 to 4 scarelings<br/>
<br/>
STEP 1.  INSERTION<br/>
<br/>
The camp spot for this raid will be the SW most corner of the zone.  This is<br/>
the &#39;normal&#39; Bristlebane crack spot.  This is NOT the ledge that people<br/>
fight from AFTER the Plane of Fear is cracked.  It is an elevated area that<br/>
is the shape of a triangle, again in the SW most corner.  Scouts will zone<br/>
in ahead of everyone and feign.  They typically make a trail to the SW<br/>
corner. This allows them to watch the path to the campsite for the<br/>
patrolling mobs.  Find out who is feigned on the hill and look for this<br/>
person and you will know you are in the right spot. Once you are sitting on<br/>
this feigner, /q and go to chat. Insertion groups will be of size 3.  The<br/>
REQUIRED buffs you will need for insertion are:<br/>
<br/>
1.	Resolution/SLN<br/>
2.	SOW<br/>
3.	Symbol (Bring extra jaspers for your clerics)<br/>
4.	Invisibility/Superior Camo<br/>
5.	Dead Man Floating<br/>
6.	Clarity (For casters)<br/>
7.	Also, go /anon (hiding guildtag spam) <br/>
<br/>
Note to the charm capable (druids, necromancers, and enchanters):  Get<br/>
Adorning Grace from an enchanter and maybe even bring a crude stein.  Reason<br/>
stated later.  <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: It is now rumored that charming a beast will agro the scareling tower.<br/>
This is VERY bad. Thus, charming will NOT be done. Feel free to pile on any<br/>
other buffs.  <br/>
<br/>
IMPORTANT:  Casters bind at the rock in the cave near the portal.  Tanks<br/>
bind in Oggok.  The alternate plan for tanks if people arent killing<br/>
bouncers is to bind in the Arena and also have a druid bind in the Arena<br/>
that can port to the Feerrott.<br/>
<br/>
Upon zoning in, head directly to the camp spot. Watch for route information<br/>
from the feigners in case a mob has snuck up to the camp.  Two routes exist:<br/>
a) Straight West<br/>
(90 degree turn left from zoning in) and then South to camp spot (another 90<br/>
degree turn once at the zone wall) or b) turn left and run around the portal<br/>
until facing SW and run straight to the corner. The crack leader will tell<br/>
the &#39;preferred&#39; route. Once there, sit on the feigner and /q.  He will be<br/>
using the /yell command to help you locate him. OKAY, HERE IS THE MOST<br/>
IMPORTANT PART.  If on the way you are agroed, YOU STOP AND DIE.  Here are<br/>
the main reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1.	Don&#39;t run off where we cant find your body<br/>
2.	DO NOT TRAIN THE HILL (This will be a reoccurring theme but cannot<br/>
be stressed enough)<br/>
3.	This path will make your body easy to find and easy to retrieve.<br/>
Once /qed on the hill, go to the chat room  <br/>
<br/>
First camped, please create the room for everyone else to enter.  Chat can<br/>
be boring while waiting for the others, but it is better than a painful CR.<br/>
Also, stay in chat as your main.  Do NOT go play an alternate. This step can<br/>
take upwards of 2 hours for a large number of people, but it is also the<br/>
most important part of the raid.<br/>
<br/>
Step 2.  STARTING THE FIGHT<br/>
<br/>
Once everyone is successfully camped inside, I, *Insert leader&#39;s name here*,<br/>
will come into chat and give the command to login.  My chat handle is<br/>
*Insert leader&#39;s chat handle here*.  Others have entered the chat room and<br/>
given false commands (chat room may require a password, make sure to get it<br/>
from your raid leader).  This only results in lots of death.  Please only<br/>
enter Norrath after my command.  Now, lots of people wait a bit for the<br/>
others to enter first.  This also only causes deaths.  Please enter promptly<br/>
and find your group leader.  Try to stay invis during this time. This must<br/>
be done quickly as we must be in groups to effectively fight.<br/>
<br/>
Now, once formed up, we watch for rovers and try to pick off singles.  Most<br/>
likely we will not get singles.  This is where the fun starts.  It is<br/>
recommended to switch to walk and take off SOW.  Now three certain mobs<br/>
cause a large amount of trouble: scarelings, amys, and turmoil toads.  <br/>
<br/>
Scarelings port you a small distance away.  <br/>
Amys are very high MR and therefore cannot be mezzed easily. <br/>
Turmoil toads fear you.  <br/>
<br/>
If feared or ported, YOU SIT DOWN FOR 10 SECONDS.  If nothing is on you,<br/>
return to the camp SLOWLY.  If attacked on the way, TURN and RUN AWAY FROM<br/>
THE CAMP.  <br/>
<br/>
DO NOT TRAIN THE CAMP.  <br/>
DO NOT TRAIN THE CAMP.  <br/>
DO NOT TRAIN THE CAMP. <br/>
<br/>
You will NOT be rezzed back in if you do.  Do get a /loc as you are dying.<br/>
During the crack, mob groups will be assisting as primary and as secondary.<br/>
Make your hotkeys before insertion.  Enchanter groups are discussed below.<br/>
When multiple mobs, we will kill scarelings first, then amys, then toads,<br/>
then whatever is left.  We must focus as a team on one mob (more on this<br/>
later).<br/>
<br/>
Now for the charm capable, have it loaded (the added charisma from adorning<br/>
grace will help loads).  Nothing helps crowd control like charming a mob and<br/>
having it beat the snot out of another.  Toads and fiends are necromancer<br/>
&#39;charmable&#39;.  Shiverbacks and spiders are druid &#39;charmable&#39;.  The enchanters<br/>
will either charm or mez.  It is their call.  <br/>
<br/>
AGAIN: Until the rumor of agroing the scareling tower is confirmed, NO<br/>
charming will be done. Necromancers can aid by using screaming terror.  THE<br/>
PRIMARY TANK WILL BREAK ALL MEZZES.  This does not mean if the primary tank<br/>
has a mob targeted to attack it, it means to taunt it.  Once you see them<br/>
swing, wail away at it.  Taunting before breaking is very important to<br/>
keeping your enchanter alive.<br/>
<br/>
RESURRECTIONS<br/>
<br/>
Resurrections during the first eight mobs will not be given, and you will be<br/>
expected to loot corpses completely.  The litter of corpses makes it very<br/>
difficult for targeting during this critical time.  If your enchanters cant<br/>
target the mobs, you will have extra corpses anyway. :P While killing the<br/>
next eight mobs, corpses will be dragged to the side and left for<br/>
resurrection later IF possible.  After 16 mobs are dead, we will move down<br/>
to the normal fighting spot and begin normal operation.  Several more rovers<br/>
will remain but can be dealt with.<br/>
<br/>
FIGHT TACTICS<br/>
<br/>
Multiple mobs are not what cause wipeouts.  Uncontrollable multiple mobs<br/>
are.  The crowd controllers try to control them, but a few resists and the<br/>
mob kills the crowd controller and then starts on the rest of the raid<br/>
party.  Then, we have multiple mobs out of the control and no crowd control.<br/>
The end result is a wipeout.  We will do this.  Groups Mob #1 to #4 will<br/>
engage the primary target and destroy it as quickly as possible.  This is 24<br/>
for one Fear mob--easy enough.  Groups Enchanter #1 and #2 will watch crowd<br/>
controllers and protect/taunt off if they are agroed.  Tanks in the<br/>
enchanter groups must assist their enchanter and have the discipline to stay<br/>
back and protect their crowd controller.  This will put stress on the tanks<br/>
of the enchanter parties, trying to stop attacking when the enchanter is<br/>
mezzing, but it can be done.  Also, WE MUST TRY TO KEEP THE MOB ON TOP OF<br/>
THE HILL.  If the mob is knocked down the hill, begin to back up and draw<br/>
the mob up the hill.<br/>
<br/>
CALLING CAMP<br/>
<br/>
The chain of command for calling camp will be raid leader, primary enchanter<br/>
and secondary enchanter in that order.  If someone dies, please state<br/>
&#39;Whoever down&#39; in /ooc.  This is important whether or not to sacrifice some<br/>
lives to finish off a mob.  This is reality of cracking Fear.  If a mob is<br/>
weakened and we dont have enough to finish it, we call camp to salvage what<br/>
we can.  If we have a chance at killing it, we fight to the bitter end.<br/>
There will be an &#39;early&#39; camp cleric.  If things appear to be getting close<br/>
to marginal whether or not we can make it.  He camps.  When one of the<br/>
leaders call camp, it is NOT a debate.  If you wish to debate it, we will do<br/>
that in the chatroom. :P  This is for during the crack and if Cazic-Thule<br/>
begins to death touch people.<br/>
<br/>
DRACO and CT<br/>
<br/>
Ok, first subject Dracoliche. This is a level 53ish bone dragon. He uses<br/>
Dragon Roar and a &#39;Rotting Flesh&#39; DoT. Draco has a wandering pattern of Fear<br/>
and is required to die before the rest of the zone can be cleared, but it is<br/>
a pullers call as when to kill him. He drops some of the best items in the<br/>
game, some of which are no drop. Draco is tied directly to CT. First to hit<br/>
or cast on Draco gets DTed instantly. Then CT will continue to DT people<br/>
during the fight. Once Draco has fallen, CT will send mobs from the temple.<br/>
If a no drop item is on Draco, we stay and fight and die if we must until<br/>
the loot winner has looted the item. Something like a MONSOON will *NOT*<br/>
rot.<br/>
<br/>
The big cheese is Cazic-Thule or CT. CT will not be attempted until the zone<br/>
is completely clear, normally about 10-12 hours after first mob death so be<br/>
prepared if you plan to stick it out to CT. He has a death touch or DT aka<br/>
cheese touch. Occassionly the puller gets too close to him and he will DT<br/>
the puller. This does not require a camp out but listen to your raid leader<br/>
for the decision. Now, if he is DTing people in the camp, we will camp out.<br/>
DO NOT /Q AT THIS TIME. If your name is on his list, you are gonna get it<br/>
anyway. The /q can possibly leave your body inside longer than desired and<br/>
when we return you could still be agro to CT. Thus, starting him up again.<br/>
This is most common for feigners to feign and /q. Please do not do this.<br/>
<br/>
MOB LOOT<br/>
<br/>
Frightfingers - Wizard <br/>
Shiverbacks - Monk <br/>
Phoboplasm - Any class <br/>
Fetid Fiend(male) - Paladin <br/>
Fetid Fiend(female) - Cleric only belt <br/>
Tentacle Terror - Ranger <br/>
Gorgon - dr00d <br/>
Turmoil Toad - Shaman only belt <br/>
Amy Knights - SK armor <br/>
Spinechiller Spider - Cryosilk Stuff <br/>
Samhain - Ranger only axe <br/>
Boogeyman - Necromancer <br/>
Scareling - Rogue weapon <br/>
Amy Warrior - Warrior weapon and shield<br/>
<br/>
Final Thoughts<br/>
<br/>
Your raid leader and puller want nothing more than to get you full plane<br/>
armor, but this is not realistic and the mobs must be cleared in an orderly<br/>
fashion. /ooc and /shout about your loot will probably only serve to insure<br/>
you wont be invited back. The puller cant talk while getting chased by a<br/>
lv50+ mob, and your leader, well, lets just say is very preoccupied. So,<br/>
please, sit patiently and quietly ready to kill. Also, please bring 20<br/>
peridots for your cleric.<br/>
