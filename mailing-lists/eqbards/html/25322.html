<div id="ygrps-yiv-934168461">Please pick a night and give us a week or so notice. TC and KIA can field<br/>
some people on most nights. We are having a great time working on<br/>
everyone&#39;s epics so I&#39;m pretty confident we can muster some firepower for<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be happy to do the organizing on our end. Btw, aren&#39;t you down to<br/>
just the scales and Trak?<br/>

I&#39;d be up for it - and I want to get our guilds together more - there&#39;s<br/>
some talk of a formal alliance. Also - I&#39;m sure KIA would be interested as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
In general Monday nights are good, some Tuesday and Friday nights, and<br/>
most<br/>
Saturday and Sunday days.&nbsp; I&#39;m always busy Wednesday and Thursday<br/>
nights...<br/>

According to the backstage board - Nortlav has never dropped anything but<br/>
a Red.Occasionally drops two of them. No one has ever confirmed a drop of<br/>
a green (at least on that board).Quamper (you didn&#39;t sign) have you seen a<br/>
green drop?<br/>
