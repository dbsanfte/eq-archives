&gt; though.... Does the first song that you get (Chant of<br/>
&gt; Battle) get better as you get better at singing etc? Or is<br/>
&gt; it just something that you use as a low level guy and<br/>
&gt; discard later?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because we only get one song per level (unlike spellcasters<br/>
who usually get 10+ spells every 4 or 5 levels), nearly all<br/>
our songs become better as you increase in level.  You will<br/>
use Chant early on, discard it around L10 (Anthem is better<br/>
for a party), then resurrect it in your 40s(?) when you get<br/>
Celerity.<br/>
<br/>
You may occasionally resurrect it in your middle levels for<br/>
the strength boost.  I twisted Chant and the Warsong with<br/>
Accelerando when I had to head back to town once almost 80 lbs<br/>
overweight.  Chant increased by str by 18 points, as did the<br/>
Warsong.  Those two picked up my running speed by quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could also use it while soloing (Athem does not<br/>
stack with Chant), twisted with Warsong...  Hmm... I wonder<br/>
why I never thought of that combo before...<br/>
