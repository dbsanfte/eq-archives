&gt; Lower Guk.  I guess a lot of the higher level players on E&#39;ci play later<br/>
&gt; than I do maybe.  I went into L Guk a month ago and there were 6 players at<br/>

night.  I&#39;ve seen it at over 100.  The only time I&#39;ve seen<br/>
fewer than 10 players there is when I was home sick and<br/>
playing at 8am on a weekday.<br/>

Kithicor is barren because the mobs are only there half the<br/>
time, train very easily (since anyone who gets in trouble has<br/>
a straight-line route to the zones), and the mobs are really<br/>
too tough for their con/exp/loot.<br/>

&gt; playing a class with downtime.  When I play y enchanter or druid the<br/>
&gt; crowding seldom bothers me as I spend enough time medding that its not as<br/>
&gt; big a deal.  The group my bard plays with though has so little downtime that<br/>
&gt; we waste a lot of time when we are fully capable of knocking something off,<br/>
&gt; only there isn&#39;t anything available.  That frustration has cost me more<br/>

I did this during a 100+ players night in LGuk.  We were<br/>
fighting things pretty much non-stop.<br/>
