<div id="ygrps-yiv-825997212">Well, <br/>
looks like we get a couple of new mez songs plus some Ancient Songs.  <br/>
I also think we got hosed on the DoT stacking issues.  Figures they <br/>
would not put in any effort to make the damage portion of our songs <br/>
stack w/o having the debuff portion stack.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone had a chance to yet locate the new level 58 song?  The patch <br/>
message makes it look like it will be a quest??<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder off what uber mob the ancient songs will drop.  Lcea <br/>
would be the logical candidate but she doesn&#39;t seem to be difficult <br/>
enough for a mob to drop ancient songs.<br/>
