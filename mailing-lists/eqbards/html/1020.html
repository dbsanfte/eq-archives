<b>Subject:</b> Anyone seen a ghost in Erud? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838834569">Hello all,<br/>
    Just wondering, has anyone seen a bad ass ghost in the woods outside of Erudin?  For fun and a change of pace, I took my lvl 5 Bard over to Erud to see if there would be any fun hunting.  Of course, I got hopelessly lost in the woods.  Anyway, in the process of asking directions someone who called me a Heretic came up behind me and clubbed me for 132 pts damage!!!  Needless to say, I died but I switched views to see who got me and there was no one there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
