 </span></blockquote>Mistmoore stands in my memory as a very bad place with lots of deaths, mostly<br/>
because<br/>
a) people overpull<br/>
b) Runners!!!<br/>
<br/>
However Graveyard can be done and be worthwhile with good people who knows that<br/>
a runner equals death there. But in my experince its not worth the effort, CZ<br/>
proved much better to me.<br/>

this place is great. Pulling from the maze, gators and even by TR and temple is<br/>
a constant flow of exp. Also FM where you have been fighting until now is great,<br/>
Hell Im still getting decent exp in FM at 35th. However the exp I get in<br/>
Overthere pulling Rhinos, Sarnaks and chicks is even better, but the loot sure<br/>
sucks.<br/>
