<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895980429"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Then to get wiped with no notice because Verant f&#39;d up?  Nah, thanks I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;&gt;stick to a live server.  At least they back those up regularly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i wouldn&#39;t blame verant for this.  blame your greedy fellow players.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So if someone should happen to steal my car because someone else stole<br/>
theirs I should blame the original thief and not the one who actually stole<br/>
my car?  What kind of f&#39;d up logic is that?  The wrongful actions of one<br/>
party do not excuse the wrongful actions of a second party in any case<br/>
unless you are claiming Verant suffered from extreme emotional distress and<br/>
was unable to act coherently.  Not that I&#39;d doubt that to be true all that<br/>
much.  Their typical responses do seem to show an extreme lack of maturity.<br/>
<br/>
Yes we read the disclaimer.  After the wipe it was changed to include player<br/>
wipes, before that it only talked about downtime, lack of gm&#39;s, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If the people on the test server were testing even 1% of the time they were<br/>
playing, then that is a service which Verant has just tossed to the wind.<br/>
Verant didn&#39;t give these testers any recompense for any test time they put<br/>
in.  Any testing they did whatsoever was totally gratis.<br/>
<br/>
Since there are no gm&#39;s on test, someone could well have reported the bugged<br/>
drops five minutes after it started.  By the time someone at Verant got<br/>
around to looking at the bug report 10 hours would have easily passed.  I<br/>
know for a fact that several bug reports I sent in were never acted upon and<br/>
the bugs I reported were propagated onto the Live servers two, even three<br/>
days later.  At least two of them were then suddenly fixed with emergency<br/>
patches in Live after thousands more people complained about the same bugs<br/>
that I know for certain were reported in Test.  Point is, Verant is in no<br/>
way responsive about checking bug reports or fixing them.<br/>
