When I was in my single digit levels I found Misty Thicket to be a great<br/>
place as a Bard.  There are lots of goblins to kill and you can easily solo<br/>
several camps with Selos.  Remember to  keep turning in the Runnyeye<br/>
Warbeads even if they don&#39;t give you xps right away.  Eventually after<br/>
killing enough goblins the halflings will warm up to you and start giving<br/>
you xps for the beads.  The only downsides are you have to get through<br/>
Kithicor Forest, The halfling guards as spastic about stealing your kills<br/>
and all that crouching makes your back ache.<br/>
<br/>
I found Misty Thicket to be a great beginning area.<br/>
