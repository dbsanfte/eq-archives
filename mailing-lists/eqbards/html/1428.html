<div id="ygrps-yiv-826550370">It&#39;s much like Bellow or Lament or Consonant Chain.  Single target, you have<br/>
to recycle it manually.  You can keep a mob charmed a long time, but it&#39;s<br/>
tricky to do more than charm it..such as charming it and fighting another.<br/>
There&#39;s no indication the song has worn off until the mob attacks you again.<br/>
You can&#39;t keep singing it and increase duration, you have to wait till it<br/>
drops then resing it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, with the fairly recent charm changes, you&#39;ll find that mobs over 25th<br/>
level are immune to it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get a message saying &quot;Creature too high level to be charmed!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unless Geoff sticks a higher level version of it in later, you&#39;ll be<br/>
charming blues only (and after a while, greens).  That gives the song a very<br/>
short career span.  But it&#39;s kinda fun while it lasts.<br/>

&gt;Solon&#39;s song of the Sirens has been my prime motivation from near the<br/>
&gt;beginning to work my musical ass off.  Can anyone comment on how this song<br/>
&gt;works?  I realize that, like most bard songs it has only a 10 - 12 second<br/>
&gt;duration, but after it wears off, can you recharm the NPC?  For that<br/>
matter,<br/>
&gt;can you continue to sing at it to ensure that the song&#39;s effects never wear<br/>
&gt;off?  We make horrible pvpers, hard to be killed, but even harder to kill<br/>
&gt;the attacker.  The best we can do is flee.  Can you charm a PC using this<br/>
&gt;song?<br/>
