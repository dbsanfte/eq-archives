<div id="ygrps-yiv-792440922">With the stuff I heard on here, I rememmed the disenchant song while<br/>
fighting in the dreadlands.  Every time we pulled a spider (I made sure the<br/>
puller wasnt using a spell to pull), I would whanck it with dispel.  The<br/>
shield would come off in the first or second pulse every time (about 20<br/>
total, far from scientific, but still 20 out of 20 is enough for me).<br/>
<br/>
This actually makes the song worthwhile in my opinion.</div>
