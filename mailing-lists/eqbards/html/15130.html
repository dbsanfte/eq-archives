<div id="ygrps-yiv-509252567">I feel a KABONG coming, but imo this *is* game related.  ;-)  Here&#39;s a<br/>
pretty good summary of the movie I picked up from this site dedicated to it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/~klaatu-/gort/index.htm">http://www.geocities.com/~klaatu-/gort/index.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
A huge &#39;flying saucer&#39; lands in Washington, D.C.  A semi-panic ensues and<br/>
troops arrive. A humanoid alien (Klaatu) and a robot (Gort) emerge, but<br/>
Klaatu is wounded by a nervous soldier. Gort then uses his laserbeam &#39;eye&#39;<br/>
to melt the weapons right out of soldiers&#39; hands and even a tank. Klaatu&#39;s<br/>
arm is treated at Walter Reed hospital and he sincerely tries to arrange a<br/>
meeting with the leaders of the world, but they cannot agree on a meeting<br/>
place, letting pettiness and pride rule them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it&quot;.<br/>
says Klaatu.<br/>
<br/>
The story continues with Klaatu escaping from the hospital, hiding out in a<br/>
boarding house, befriending a young boy, and contacting a renowned scientist<br/>
in the attempt to meet with the best scientific minds of Earth.  Even they<br/>
require convincing, so Klaatu arranges to (and does) shut down all of<br/>
Earth&#39;s electrical power for half an hour (hence the title).  Klaatu is<br/>
hunted down by the military, killed, and brought back to life by Gort, and<br/>
introduces the world to the phrase, &quot;Gort, Klaatu verada nikto&quot;.  One<br/>
reviewer thought that means &quot;don&#39;t destroy the planet&quot;.  I rather believe it<br/>
means, &quot;Hey, come get me!&quot;, but yes, &quot;spare those dumb humans&quot; is part of<br/>
it.  Anyway, once he finally has our attention (and is ready to leave), he<br/>
addresses a world audience, warning us that unless the people of Earth stop<br/>
their nuclear frenzy, *which also endangers the rest of the universe*, Gort<br/>
and the rest of the robots on Klaatu&#39;s planet will reduce the world &quot;to a<br/>
burnt-out cinder&quot;.  &quot;The choice,&quot; declares Klaatu, &quot;is yours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It still is.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to believe this was made in 1951 - it&#39;s still a cool movie.<br/>

&gt; shouldn&#39;t ask<br/>
&gt; unless we can figure out how this relates to bards... :)<br/>
