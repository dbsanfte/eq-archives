<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Numbers on Bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-313626436">&lt;snip&gt; Bertoxx Bards are enjoying a bit of a renaissance - I<br/>
typically see 18 in the 40-60 range and 30 or more from 1-39. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	I personally think that alot of the &quot;old&quot; bards are getting dusted<br/>
off and played with the new mezz song changes, song additions and such.  As<br/>
a level 55 bard, my friends are beginning to see me as a viable replacement<br/>
for an enchanter in many &quot;Exp groups&quot;.  With a combination of root parking<br/>
and bard mezzing, we can do some of the &quot;deeper&quot; areas of dungeons that have<br/>
historically been limited to only groups with enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
	My regular grouping buddies have commented that in the &quot;lower<br/>
stress&quot; mezzing situations..i.e. with 3 or less creatures requiring mezzes,<br/>
I am actually a better choice for mezzing since I have such low resists with<br/>
the level 53 song. Not to mention...I can take a hell of a lot more beating<br/>
than an enchanter can.<br/>
