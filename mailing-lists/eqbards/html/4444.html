&gt; &gt;   Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>
&gt; &gt; considering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More that the well balanced is horrifically overpriced. Try selling one<br/>
&gt; back to a vendor for a more realistic idea of it&#39;s true value. Everyone<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The dirk is still underpriced.  A barbed whip typically sells<br/>
for about 80-150pp, and it has a worse damage/delay ratio<br/>
than the dirk and no magical modifiers.  The dirk price is<br/>
slowly climbing now that Dvinn doesn&#39;t carry it all the time<br/>
anymore.  If JM&#39;s 10% figure is right, I expect it&#39;ll level<br/>
out at about the same price as a barbed whip.  While it&#39;s<br/>
better than the whip, it&#39;s still a lot easier to get since<br/>
it&#39;s &quot;right there&quot; in Crushbone.  I think the whip is rarer<br/>
than 10% as well.<br/>
<br/>
And for those about to jump in that my prices are off, I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed significant price variability depending on what server<br/>
you&#39;re on.  Most seem to put the whip in the 80-150 range, but<br/>
I&#39;ve seen quotes as low as 40-50, and as high as 200-300.<br/>
