always playing some song, you might not have noticed that little detail.<br/>

&gt; Ok heres my problem...2 months ago i hit the hide button and the thing<br/>
&gt; never recycled back through.  Well, when i recieved the sneak skill two<br/>
&gt; lvls ago, i put 3 points into it hoping to try it out...nothing.  The<br/>
&gt; hide skill is not allowing me to use it.  So i thought maybe if i put<br/>
&gt; some more points into the sneak skill it would cycle the button through<br/>
&gt; faster.  It didn&#39;t.  So far i have put 8 skill points into sneak and<br/>
&gt; have not been able to use it once.  Is this normal?  or do you all think<br/>
&gt; that maybe mine is screwed up?<br/>
