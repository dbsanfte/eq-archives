<div id="ygrps-yiv-265978481">Woohoo!  I&#39;m not the youngest bard on the list!  Heh heh.  I&#39;m currently<br/>
level 10, so you&#39;ll outlevel me soon & be giving me advice.  Until then...<br/>
<br/>
solo:  battle chant + hymn + whistle<br/>
group:  chant + hymn, or chant + hymn + jig<br/>
<br/>
the only time I use the wince song is if I&#39;m pulling in an open area.  It<br/>
helps avoid 10 minutes of  &quot;your target is too far away, you can&#39;t see your<br/>
target, your target is too far away, etc&quot;.  Just one pulse to get their<br/>
attention then I go back to the setlist.<br/>
<br/>
When I got the level 9 MR I switched to using that in place of either jig or<br/>
hymn depending on whether we had a tank & healer or what we were fighting.  <br/>
<br/>
When I got the level 10 Anthem I switched to using that in place of chant<br/>
unless I was in a caster heavy group.  Chant gives a dexterity buff that<br/>
finger wigglers appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m just starting to get into situations where I keep my instruments<br/>
in hand for entire battles.  These are still the exception, but when I do do<br/>
it it&#39;s affects are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Peace & happy hunting<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I am about to hit level 8 so I dont have a lot of them, <br/>
&gt; however what I do<br/>
&gt; is start off by singing the str/dex song you get at lev1, <br/>
&gt; then once its<br/>
&gt; started<br/>
&gt; I start up my regeneration song, then I start whistling the <br/>
&gt; ancient warsong<br/>
&gt; (lev 7)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; then I keep rotating between em to keep them going, and so <br/>
&gt; far it seems to<br/>
&gt; work<br/>
&gt; nicely for me.  I will occasionally add in the lev 2 song <br/>
&gt; that makes the<br/>
&gt; enemy &quot;wince&quot;<br/>
&gt; but its kind of dangerous and Im never sure if its helping <br/>
&gt; much anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What are some tips I can look forward to using at future levels?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, well...I was gonna ask about some weapons...but Ill put <br/>
&gt; it in another<br/>
&gt; mail to keep this thread pure.<br/>
