<div id="ygrps-yiv-221051271">I lost my body to Meldrath in those Minotaur caves too!  And I also thought this<br/>
would be a permanent condition.  But I got very lucky.  A really nice Ranger<br/>
knew what had happened to me and vowed to get my body back.  He initially failed<br/>
because it is just not possible for sub-god-level characters to get anywhere<br/>
near Meldrath without getting charmed or having Mino Guards attack them through<br/>
walls, but as I was leaving the area I got a message from the Ranger asking for<br/>
permission to loot my corpse (corpses) and I eventually got back most of my<br/>
stuff (he could not carry it all).<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here is what you need.  You need someone who is resistant to Charm Person<br/>
to get close enough to attract Meldrath or his gaurds&#39; attention and train them<br/>
out.  Then you can go in and recover your body.  I know that is no small thing,<br/>
but it is possible.<br/>
<br/>
If that sounds too risky or too difficult, Crushbone is probably the best loot<br/>
nearby, but it is also a tough place to stay alive unless you are with a really<br/>
good group, and even then jerks may make life tough.<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>

&gt; After an unfortunate night in Steamfont with a wrong turn to Meldrath I lost<br/>
&gt; my corpse permanently.  Any ideas on where to hunt for money to replenish my<br/>
&gt; funds, as well as get good exp?<br/>
