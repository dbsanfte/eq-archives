<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761008658"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   Anyway, on to my question.  How much does a diety effect your actual <br/>
&gt;abilities<br/>
&gt;and inter-race relations?  I play a Wood Elf bard, and have enjoyed it <br/>
&gt;immensly,<br/>
&gt;but chose my diety as Tunare for fear of fraction problems.  I roleplay my<br/>
&gt;character as a romantic, so naturally Erolisi Marr (sp?) seems like a good<br/>
&gt;choice, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effects on others.  Would love to hear from<br/>
&gt;another bard who has tried more than one diety perhaps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I went agnostic with my bard so I couldn&#39;t comment on BARDS and their <br/>
dieties. The only problem I EVER had with non-evil race merchants was the <br/>
non-half-elf spell merchants in Qeynos wizard guild not wanting to talk to <br/>
me EVER. I kinda took pride in my charisma and my party liked to have me buy <br/>
their things at a better rate. Anyways, I do have an example of a non-bard <br/>
class making a diety choice that affects faction. I had a gnome necromancer <br/>
acquaintance who didn&#39;t have much problem with any merchants because he went <br/>
agnostic instead of choosing an evil diety (as many do). He tried playing a <br/>
gnome necro before that with an evil diety as patron, and had problems. I <br/>
don&#39;t know if this is still the case in the current state of Everquest.<br/>
