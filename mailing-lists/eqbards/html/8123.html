<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-327947677">First of all thanks to all those that replied to my mail. I am now running around Steamfont in Black Gear with Bronze boots and helm, still no gloves. I was overwelmed with all the positive responces, my boyfriend said I would get flamed. <br/>
<br/>
Now to the question, I have tried to blend more than 2 songs together and kepp getting hit and forgetting where I am until one icon dissapears, is there an easy way to see what is about to run out or an easier way to mix songs apart from in the quick icon spot on the bottom left ?<br/>
<br/>
Answers in private please, most know how to do this.<br/>
<br/>
