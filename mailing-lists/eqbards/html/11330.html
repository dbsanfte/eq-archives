<div id="ygrps-yiv-478843431">Great take Adon!  Yes we all get a little testy at times, and all I think<br/>
share a love for bards in general, not just in EQ.  Sometimes, ok most<br/>
times, the bard in EQ is treated worse then a redheaded stepchild, at least<br/>
worse than this particular redhead.  While our abilities give us versatility<br/>
they oftimes leave us second or third rate in certain groupings.  We can<br/>
give wonderful things to a group that is lacking in just about any area, but<br/>
if a group is already well balanced we seem to falter.  At certain level<br/>
groupings we have many advantages, but at others we seriously lack punch.<br/>
As we get higher in level above 24th we get more frail, unable to take the<br/>
pounding we did at earlier levels.  If a monk is the character least likely<br/>
to die in any encounter, we are probably most likely.  <br/>

To all my fellow bards,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t have time to write this mail as I would like so I will be<br/>
brief and ask for your understanding if I miss the gramatical and spelling<br/>
issues I would normally correct.  I also beg your indulgence on what is not<br/>
exactly a bard issue but certainly does deal with this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago now there was a post by Steelwolf that pretty heavily slammed<br/>
down on a fellow bard about problems with our class the title being<br/>
something along the lines of &quot;Bard sit in or mana song out&quot;.  I found the<br/>
tone and the wording of the letter inappropriate and harsh both to the<br/>
person it was written to and the bard list in general.  In responce I took<br/>
it upon myself to address the issue and slammed Steelwolf back down fairly<br/>
hard although I think constructively, however Steelwolf I do want to<br/>
apologise for it I should have been more kind in the admonishment if I was<br/>
going to post it at all.  On the other hand I think you knew what I meant<br/>
because the rest of your posts have been much more expressive of your point<br/>
and constructive with idea&#39;s as I tried to support with my reply to your<br/>
level 17 lullaby post.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With that said and a sincere apology again to Steelwolf, I&#39;m going to agian<br/>
take it on myself to say something this time however not to just one person<br/>
but to all of us including myself.  We all come from different area&#39;s<br/>
upbringings, age groups, value systems.  We all share a love for gaming, our<br/>
characters, and I feel safe to say a love for the class of character we on<br/>
this list all share, The Bard.  My point in this is to say that this list<br/>
has begun to degenerate at times to a step just above but very close to<br/>
flaming.  It&#39;s not something I want to see.  I tend to belive most of the<br/>
rest of us don&#39;t want to see it either.  There are going to be differences<br/>
of opinion it&#39;s natural, how we express them is what is key.  There is no<br/>
cause to beat someone with a different opinion on something down even if you<br/>
hold that opinion very strongly in the opposite direction.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lets hear eachother out take the list like a buffet go get what you like and<br/>
leave the rest in peace.  If you want to be part of the greater &quot;concensus&quot;<br/>
then by all means try and state your view and show it&#39;s merit, but do NOT do<br/>
it in such a manner as to insult or berate someone else.  I&#39;m at times as<br/>
guilty as others of it so I&#39;m not trying to be a preacher, I just don&#39;t want<br/>
to see anyone feel unwelcome because in the end it&#39;s all about fun.  One<br/>
last comment, No this isn&#39;t about being thought or word police it&#39;s about<br/>
giving the respect you would expect for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ohh and Steelwolf thanks for all the really great posts and again sorry for<br/>
being heavy handed.<br/>
