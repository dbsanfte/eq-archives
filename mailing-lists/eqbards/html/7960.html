&gt; My argument isn&#39;t that melee classes NEED bind, but that bind SHOULD be<br/>
&gt; able to work on melee classes.  Binding in city zones only was a quick-fix<br/>
&gt; to the problem of malicious binds.<br/>
&gt; I quite agree.  There is no supportable reason in game-logic to permit casters to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bind anyone in a city and themselves only anywhere else.  This was a nerf, and it <br/>
is a nerf that Verant has demonstrated is not necessary (since they have the <br/>
ability to ask for player consent).  Incidentally, the term &quot;malicious&quot; binding <br/>
overdramatizes (and underestimates) the problem.  The problem for me has alway been <br/>
kindly but unasked for binding.  Casters repeatedly make the assumption that I must <br/>
want to be bound to the city that they consider &quot;closest&quot; to where the group is <br/>
headed, and will often bind me without asking.  Yes, if I was in a steady group, I <br/>
could work this out.  Some of us are not so lucky.<br/>
<br/>
As for all of the contributors to this list who have insisted that Verant will <br/>
never change their policy, rendering this discussion moot, I suggest that you take <br/>
some basic business courses.  Verant offers a consumer product with a large variety <br/>
of options; if their customer base really dislikes one of the options, VERANT WILL <br/>
CHANGE IT.  They would be idiots not to!  And, as consumers, we would be idiots not <br/>
to complain when we see something we dislike.<br/>
<br/>
Three of my four characters are my Bard and two pure melee characters.  I do not <br/>
pick characters on the basis of the Bind spell, I happen to like melee characters <br/>
enough to play them anyway.  But I still think the way that Bind currently works is <br/>
both unfair and logically insupportable, and it should be changed.<br/>
