<div id="ygrps-yiv-730412274">Current theory I&#39;ve heard is that the Mirror that requires a key on the 7th<br/>
Floor of the Tower of the Frozen Shadow leads to PoM.  Right now, one of the<br/>
key NPCs in the quest for the key is turned off on Xegony.  Spawns with a !.<br/>
The quest I know of goes thru Kael, so I&#39;m hoping that the key will take the<br/>
whole party like all the other mirrors in the Tower.  Or, maybe there&#39;s more<br/>
than one quest for those of us who chose to ruin Giant faction. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Can y&#39;all keep an eye out for PoM stuff, and send it my way?  That&#39;s the<br/>
