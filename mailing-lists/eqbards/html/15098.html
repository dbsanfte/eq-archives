<div id="ygrps-yiv-140073897"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hmmm I do not think the recently deceased Human who is bumping<br/>
&gt;around in the<br/>
&gt;dark would agree with you here...  Also people with dark video equipment<br/>
&gt;(graphics card and/or monitor) find this useful as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES!<br/>
Like me? :)<br/>
In some places, the surrounding is as dark for my wood elf druid and<br/>
my half elf bard as for my Erudite enchanter. Night vision does NOT<br/>
work as well on a darker system (or maybe its because I am playing<br/>
on a laptop)<br/>
<br/>
I can even play Human with little problems on my friend&#39;s computer.<br/>
Even at nighttime, in most zones they are fine. (zoning out of BB to<br/>
Everfrost is a problem)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Identify<br/>
&gt;Try to complete the Lambent armor quests without this one.  Also i have a<br/>
&gt;feeling that many more quests will have items in the future that<br/>
&gt;need to be identified.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last night Windsong, lvl 50 bard, was using this song to identify whether<br/>
an item was part of a quest or not. This also identifies the parts of the<br/>
Runes. Sure, its not always memmed. But when you need it, its good to<br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Just because you find something useless does not mean the rest of<br/>
&gt;us do.  I<br/>
&gt;know of people that even find Disenchanting Melody useful.  Usually in a<br/>
&gt;Melee heavy group without a buffer from what I have heard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ve heard PvP servers consider Mellifluous Melody as essential as well.<br/>
