<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742172399">Had a really weird thing happen the other night.  I was running thru Qeynos<br/>
looking for tailoring supplies and checking all the vendors.  I found a HQ<br/>
bear pelt which made me happy, but the merchant also had Mistmoore Drums and<br/>
a Blessed Ring of Nife.  The Drums were way out of my price range, but I<br/>
couldn&#39;t imagine why anyone would sell them to a merchant even if they were<br/>
quitting their bard.  The Ring of Nife is also very useful and was only 2pp<br/>
or so.  I can&#39;t wait to see the look on our cleric&#39;s face the next time he<br/>
is OOM and we desperately need a Greater Heal.<br/>
