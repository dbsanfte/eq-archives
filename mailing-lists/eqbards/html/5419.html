&gt; Uhm, I think you are wrong about how hymn works, or I just misread your<br/>
&gt; post.  You seem to be implying that each time you sing hymn, it has an<br/>
&gt; effect.  This is not true.  The song acts much (exactly) like a Druids or<br/>
&gt; Shaman&#39;s regen spells, in that it increases the amount of health regenerated<br/>
&gt; for each normal recovery point, which come about 6 seconds apart, just the<br/>
&gt; effect is either on or off, it doesn&#39;t add a certain amount of health for<br/>

intervals passed throughout the fight while I was cycling<br/>
three songs.  Normally I do it faster than 6 seconds, but I<br/>
was being a bit &quot;lazy&quot; weaving 3 songs so that I was bordering<br/>
on losing song effects.  I suppose I should&#39;ve used a<br/>
stopwatch to time the fight, but I didn&#39;t and I felt my timing<br/>
was consistent enough that 27 song startups equated to 27 6<br/>
second intervals.<br/>
