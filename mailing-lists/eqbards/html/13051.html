<div id="ygrps-yiv-70469102">Well I&#39;ve certainly killed enough mobs in Mistmoore if thats the criteria.<br/>
I&#39;ve also done the mail runs on at least 30-40 occasions.  <br/>
<br/>
Question: Does raising faction with The League of Antonican Bards (increased<br/>
when killing Mistmoore mobs) raise faction with all three bard guilds?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, other than bard NPCs in the three guilds and the bard messengers<br/>
posted in or near all the city zones, what other bard NPCs are there in the<br/>
game?  I know of one in South Karana (Vhalen?) and one in the East Freeport<br/>
tavern near the dock.  Off the top of my head I can&#39;t remember any more bard<br/>
NPCs.  Anyone out there got a complete list of bard NPCs and where they are<br/>
located?  They should be the first ones we check.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; (to my knowledge).  If morning dew is in the game but hard to find, I<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; the plan we implemented should have found it.  But based on our negative<br/>
&gt; &gt; results, everyone came to the conclusion that Verant was incorrect in<br/>
&gt; &gt; claiming morning dew was in the game.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now we have GZ telling us that Kelin&#39;s lute and the small brass trumpet<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the game but hard to find.  Assuming these are acquired via a quest,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would think that trying something similar to what the brewers tried with<br/>
&gt; &gt; morning dew is the first step to discovering the secret.  I think we can<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You also might need the correct faction.  Perhaps having<br/>
&gt; killed enough mobs in Mistmoore and delivered enough mail will<br/>
&gt; do it.<br/>
