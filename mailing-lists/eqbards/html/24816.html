<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809887595">On the Conch Shell, Talies.... Another bard and I both picked up one in a<br/>
matter of just a few hours, dropping of enticing sirens (L50-53ish) or siren<br/>
seductresses (L56-57ish).  The shell itself is MAGIC ITEM it says, but both<br/>
of us found that it added nothing to our numbers. The 5% stated here I think<br/>
would&#39;ve shown on Berserker&#39;s Crescendo at least a little, but we were using<br/>
raw data really, producing hasty field resluts. I can do more extensive<br/>
investigation on it, time permitting.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I haven&#39;t researched it online anywhere, but I did notice it<br/>
had a weight of like 4.5 iirc.  And for the graphic being the same, there<br/>
should be some sort of stat enhancement, you&#39;d think. The store-bought horn<br/>
weighs far less, adding the same result to the song. If this horn isn&#39;t in<br/>
your weight reducing bag, you could become encumbered quickly. =/<br/>
<br/>
Off Topic...<br/>
Has anyone killed the named siren type mobs down there, the ones past the<br/>
seductresses and icy servants? I recall there being 2 right near each other,<br/>
and another yet on track somewhere.  I was using bind sight on our 59<br/>
pulling monk, and he said splitting those broads was the hardest pulls he&#39;s<br/>
ever had to do. He said that when he FD&#39;d, the mobs wouldn&#39;t split, they<br/>
would *both* immediately start walking back to their spawn points. Anyway,<br/>
somehow he did pull just one, and she was quite rough, the usual quad<br/>
hitting, summoning type mob (red to me at 55), and wouldn&#39;t stun for<br/>
anything.  Well she ended up gating back, and bringing all her friends of<br/>
course, then CH&#39;d - fun! That was attempt 3 btw, and the only time we had<br/>
just one mob. We packed it up after that ;)<br/>
