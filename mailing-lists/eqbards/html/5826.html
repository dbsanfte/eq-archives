<div id="ygrps-yiv-331284951">only thing that resisted me was the tae that dropped the rubi legs last<br/>
night as i tried to charm it before a competing SK did his harm touch (hey<br/>
he was a jerk so i had to try). would of been nice to charm it after seeing<br/>
him gloat at how he can HT it... oh well, got bored there and was able to<br/>
charm a very red hill giant later on in the night so dunno. All in all<br/>
making over 100pp a night killing giants makes up for anything 8)<br/>

&gt; Am I imagining things or has anyone else been getting<br/>
&gt; an ungodly amount of resists.  Things that 2 days ago<br/>
&gt; I could charm, fear, or chain with now problem were<br/>
&gt; now getting 3 or 4 resists in a row.  Things like<br/>
&gt; lizard men in cazic and aviaks out at KFC (Karana<br/>
&gt; Fried Chicken).  All things that conned blue to me,<br/>
&gt; but were seemingly unimpressed with my vocal a talent.<br/>
&gt;  Am I out of my mind?  I didn&#39;t have any charisma<br/>
&gt; items one (except for my veil) so my charisma was only<br/>
&gt; 95.  Could that be it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a more humourous note, I was passing through the<br/>
&gt; Rathe Mountains and saw that big skele so I chamed<br/>
&gt; him, he was standing by an orc shaman so I told him to<br/>
&gt; attack it.  The fought, the charm wore off, and before<br/>
&gt; the skele came at me, the shaman cast SOW on it. <br/>
&gt; Couldn&#39;t believe it.  So I recharmed the skele who<br/>
&gt; then made short work of the shaman.  Me and my pet ran<br/>
&gt; down the road where couple of trolls where camping<br/>
&gt; lizard men.  As soon as they heard the big feet o<br/>
&gt; stompin, they scattered.  Had to send them a tell to<br/>
&gt; let them know he was my pet.  My biggest complaint<br/>
&gt; about the charm song is that it&#39;s so freakin fun that<br/>
&gt; I spend 50% more time goofing off.  Oh well.  One more<br/>
&gt; question, do you not get exp for a creature your pet<br/>
&gt; kills? Twice I had a rook kill another rook and got no<br/>
&gt; exp for it.  <br/>
