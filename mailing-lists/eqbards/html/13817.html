<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-973082401">It appears that your friends list is located in the eqOptions1.opt file. I&#39;m<br/>
uncertain what would happen if you were to remove the file, but I would<br/>
assume it would rebuild it. Your hot keys appear to be in your<br/>
&quot;charactername.opt&quot; file, so I would not recommend touching that.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, according to Verant&#39;s policy, they might consider this a hack, so<br/>
you&#39;re up to your own on whether you want to try this.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there anyway to delete your entire /friend list and start <br/>
&gt; over?  I typed<br/>
&gt; in /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; seen in a long<br/>
&gt; time.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed <br/>
&gt; in addition to<br/>
&gt; players.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, <br/>
&gt; or /groupsay but<br/>
&gt; instead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the <br/>
&gt; phrase I typed<br/>
&gt; to my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire <br/>
&gt; list, there are<br/>
&gt; a few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made <br/>
&gt; numerous attempts<br/>
&gt; at removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces <br/>
&gt; before I type<br/>
&gt; in any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my <br/>
&gt; friend list.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ <br/>
&gt; directory this will<br/>
&gt; delete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>
&gt; friends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
