&gt;Apologies that this is not bard specific, but it is certainly strongly<br/>
&gt;related to the playing and discussing of EverQuest.   Although we are<br/>
&gt;generally bards here, with bardic concerns, it is my belief that, with a<br/>
&gt;strong bias toward bardic concerns in bardic terms, this forum is easily<br/>
&gt;one of the best, if not the best, for considerations of life in Norrath in<br/>
&gt;general.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Second only to being there, it is certainly my most important and effective<br/>
&gt;means of understanding how Thrush may most enjoy and profit from his life<br/>
&gt;in Norrath.<br/>

&gt;So how is that better than &quot;cast now or I&#39;ll trade you in?&quot;  In fact,<br/>
&gt;saying and thinking &quot;cast&quot; seems better to me.  I imagine shaking the fool<br/>
&gt;weapon between blows and thinking, &quot;It&#39;s supposed to cast that fool spell,<br/>
&gt;why won&#39;t it do it when I need it most.  I need a rune I can touch or a<br/>
&gt;word I can say to make it cast when *I* want it to.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Imagine that the recalcitrant caster is not a weapon that casts in its own<br/>
&gt;sweet time and whim but rather a slow, confused, undependable member of<br/>
&gt;your party.  I doubt you&#39;d feel the need for a special word to encourage<br/>
&gt;the person.<br/>

well-read and all, but I was being a little sarcastic... =)<br/>
