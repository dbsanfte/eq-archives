<div id="ygrps-yiv-192112914">Hmm this was my understanding ....<br/>
<br/>
The base code in Windows ME is the same &quot;kernel&quot; code as in Win95 .. 98 etc<br/>
<br/>
Win2k however is built with much of the same code used in WindowsNT (thier<br/>
advertised as stable business OS).<br/>
<br/>
In both cases IMHO how it runs on your box with your cards and your software<br/>
will come down to how dependent on the OS your application is for one.  And<br/>
on the layers (drivers for example) where you are OS interface dependent ..<br/>
did the vendor both sign the non-compete clause with Microsoft and therby<br/>
gettng access to the preferred and often non documented interface? and did<br/>
they know someone at MS to get support and confirm bugs.  Both code-bases<br/>
have thier issues, it just .. well depends.  So say an application that<br/>
codes strictly to a driver layer, and a driver layer that was written by<br/>
people &quot;well-connected&quot; to MS interfaces and support .. will work fine.  But<br/>
an app which bypasses the driver layer and uses (perfectly well documented<br/>
btw) OS calls may really wig out ...<br/>
<br/>
Or what you run may have the capacity to go *poof* but you never happen to<br/>
trigger that exact call sequence the way you play.<br/>
<br/>
So, your milage may vary .. a LOT.   The two code-bases due have diferent<br/>
&quot;features&quot; ME/2k .. but ... most of the impression of one being &quot;more<br/>
stable&quot; than the other is based on thier origins.  It will really depend on<br/>
*what* you want to do.<br/>
<br/>
As well, there are few driver-coder organizations which wrote a lt of<br/>
commercial drivers for WindowNT .. so I would expect there to be a short<br/>
time gap while most peripheral vendors get used to the more NT-like<br/>
architecture of 2K. Sort of like the game gap while console game guys come<br/>
up to speed on the PS2.   IMHO a rule of thumb for me on whether I expect my<br/>
box to run Win2k well .. did the makers of my cards drivers have WinNT<br/>
drivers for them?  If so .. its a good bet they had a jump on 2K drivers.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has<br/>
&gt; inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a less-than-desirable<br/>
&gt; platform.  Win2k, on the other hand, apparently has the stability, which<br/>
&gt; comes at the cost of speed, due to security features.  I just wanted some<br/>
&gt; responses from people with practical experience in the matter.  Thanks!<br/>
