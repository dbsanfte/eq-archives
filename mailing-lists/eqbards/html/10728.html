<div id="ygrps-yiv-814777832">I would like to say that this was a blast for me too.  It was really<br/>
cool to see all of you guys there....I got to meet a few that I have<br/>
seen posting regular notes on the list and felt very priveledged. <br/>
*waves at Sylly*.  Thanks for letting me be a part of it.  Things went<br/>
very well...3 hours and most of the little gnomes were in the lava...I<br/>
was the poor druid trying to port all the little guys...my thank you to<br/>
the kind soul who cast clarity on me so that this was possible.  Thanks<br/>
to Aloro for arranging it.  It was alot of fun...and you know that on<br/>
our server they were all referring to it as gnomespam 99.  I loved<br/>
going back and looking at all the dead gnome bodies later...heheh<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>

&gt; at <br/>
&gt; this event.  It&#39;s tough to describe for those of you who missed it,<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; try and picture 60 drunken Gnomes outside the Freeport gates, waving <br/>
&gt; lutes and charging en masse to Lavastorm.  And boy, did we annoy the<br/>
&gt; Dark <br/>
&gt; Elves in Nektulos!  (Did you ever notice that Dark Elves have no<br/>
&gt; sense of <br/>
&gt; humor?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I actually managed to make it to the Temple of Solusek Ro ledge,<br/>
&gt; where I <br/>
&gt; was able to fling myself into the lava along with perhaps twenty<br/>
&gt; others <br/>
&gt; that I saw up there.  There was, sadly, a fair amount of attrition<br/>
&gt; along <br/>
&gt; the way (not unexpected).  I tried to get back two more times, but<br/>
&gt; kept <br/>
&gt; getting chomped by piranhas in the Nektulos river.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My roommate, who generally raises an eyebrow at this game, watched<br/>
&gt; most <br/>
&gt; of it and found it hilarious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanted to thank Aloro, et al, for organizing this, and the E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt; higher <br/>
&gt; level players who spent several hours helping all of us idiots with <br/>
&gt; teleports, binding, SOW, beer and lutes.  I&#39;d appreciate it if you<br/>
&gt; E&#39;ci <br/>
&gt; bards could pass on my thanks.<br/>
