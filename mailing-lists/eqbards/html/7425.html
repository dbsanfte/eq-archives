<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085138549"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think the reagent should be a musical instrument ;)  But that&#39;s just me.<br/>
&gt;Of course, I&#39;ve been arguing long for giving NPCs bind-for-plat :P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now this is an interesting idea! You could make a Special instrument that is<br/>
a container, have it require 1 or more reagents, when the bard hits combine<br/>
it becomes with one charge of bind, of course the instrument would be no<br/>
drop no trade.  When the bard starts singing his song, he can right click it<br/>
and complete the bind.  It could still cause exp loss, and the song sould<br/>
still be unusable for 2 days afterword.  Interesting..</div>
