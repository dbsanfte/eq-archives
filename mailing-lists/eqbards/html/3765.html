&gt;there was a barbarian standing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>around up near the zone creatively using the crouch and sit commands to make<br/>
himself appear to be dancing... and yelling &quot;Dancing for money!&quot; and similar<br/>
such things.  It made me laugh, and my bard was suitably amused to give him<br/>
5 gold on the spot along with a few words of encouragement to continue<br/>
practicing as he might one day have a career in dance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now THAT deserved 5 gp.  At least he was IC, and using some imagination.  <br/>
Besides, can you think of anything funnier than a barbarian dancing? LOL.<br/>
