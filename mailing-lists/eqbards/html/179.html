<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089646408">I thought the same thing at first but I&#39;ve seen strange things that would<br/>
beg to differ. An example was when I was fighting something and was stacking<br/>
Chords, Hymn, and Jonthan&#39;s in that order. Even though I did not see any<br/>
wince message or orange flare the creature I was fighting died (&#39;A<br/>
&lt;creature&gt; dies.&#39; not &#39;You have slain a &lt;creature&gt;.&#39;) from the Chords when<br/>
Jonthan&#39;s was pulsing, two whole pulses after the &#39;signaled&#39; one. I think<br/>
Hymn will also heal throughout all three pulses as well. At least that&#39;s<br/>
what I&#39;ve noticed anyway.<br/>

&gt; Greetings all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I did some test to find out the efficiency of Jonathans Warsong and<br/>
&gt; Anthem de Arms.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I noticed is that you say you stack Anthem, Warsong and Chords<br/>
etc.  This tactic doesn&#39;t actually work all that well.   This has to do<br/>
with my pulse vs. constant theory.  Bard songs fit into two categories,<br/>
in my opinion, pulse songs and constant songs.  Constant songs have an<br/>
effect that lasts as long as the icon is on your screen.  Anthem is a<br/>
good example.  Once it is activated, the increase in strength and attack<br/>
speed lasts until that icon disappears, even if you stop playing the<br/>
song.  Other songs, like Chords of Dissonance or Hymn of Restoration are<br/>
pulse-based, only giving you an effect when the lights flash.  The pulse<br/>
based songs, therefore, do not stack well, since sharing their playing<br/>
time with others only leads to their effectiveness being decreased.<br/>
