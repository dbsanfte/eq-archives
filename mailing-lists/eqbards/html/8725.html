<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315537939">i have never been up against the negotiator.  even with a 50 MR without my<br/>
song, and taking my level into account compared to hers, i was surprised<br/>
Mynthi pulled it off.  of course NPCs don&#39;t follow the same rules as PCs so<br/>
she got lucky i guess =)  in fact i am not sure about my song, i am pretty<br/>
sure i attacked before it pulsed me to 110 MR, but i like to think it didn&#39;t<br/>
cause if she charmed me being 10 or so levels lower and with 110 MR she is<br/>
frighteningly good.  i don&#39;t even know why i went after her, as she had the<br/>
lute in hand and the person i was with only wanted her for a drum.  just<br/>
sitting in the tower hearing &quot;Mynthi Davissi begins to cast a spell&quot; over<br/>
and over i couldn&#39;t take it anymore and had to GO GET HER hehe.<br/>

&gt; Any idea which is worse, Mynthi or the negotiator?  The<br/>
&gt; negotiator managed to charm me at level 36 while I was playing<br/>
&gt; one magic resist song (93 resist). </span></blockquote></div>
