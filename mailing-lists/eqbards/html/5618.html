<b>Subject:</b> Invisibility against undead (was End of Kiting?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-304510749">Well I am completely confused on this issue.  I have had two types of<br/>
invisibility spells cast on me.  One is the magic user type that just shows<br/>
&quot;Invisibility&quot; when you right click on the icon.  The second one is the<br/>
&quot;Invisibility to Undead&quot; that clerics and paladins can cast.  I was always<br/>
under the impression that our invisibility song functioned like the magic<br/>
user type Invisibility spell and as a result was no good against undead,<br/>
which I assumed had the innate ability to See Invisiblility (otherwise why<br/>
have a distinct spell for it).<br/>
<br/>
These leads into another question, John stated that sometimes the hag casts<br/>
See Invisibility on the mobs and thats why they still attack you when you<br/>
sing the song.  What about other types of mobs?  Do any creatures out there<br/>
have the innate ability to See Invisibility or do they have to also cast the<br/>
See Invisibility spell?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Look at this nonsense I pulled of EQVault, of course people are pissed,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant NEVER tells us when they nerf our abilities...I lost the invis vs<br/>
&gt; &gt; undead affect of the clouding song and nobody told me until I nearly<br/>
&gt; died<br/>
&gt; &gt; finding out by mistake:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I visited Unrest last week and had no problems using Clouding<br/>
&gt; to sneak past undead.  I explored a good portion of the<br/>
&gt; basement using it, then I spent a good 3-4 hours pulling from<br/>
&gt; the basement using the song to scout ahead before pulling. The<br/>
&gt; song most definitely still works against undead - I would con<br/>
&gt; them and they&#39;d be in different to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Like I said, sometimes the hags cast see invisible on<br/>
&gt; themselves and other mobs.  Or if you end up with a buggy mob<br/>
&gt; aggressive to you (which shouldn&#39;t happen anymore with the<br/>
&gt; teleporting mob fix they put in), it and anything it alerts<br/>
&gt; will remain aggressive to you even if you&#39;re invisible.<br/>
&gt; Another possibility is that they changed the song so that the<br/>
&gt; invisibility to undead effect does not kick in until you reach<br/>
&gt; a higher level.  I&#39;ll have to as a bard friend that just got<br/>
&gt; the song to test it for me.<br/>
