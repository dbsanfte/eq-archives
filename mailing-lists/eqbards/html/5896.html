&gt; &gt; So if the time between the message and flickering is 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; seconds, with 6 second pulses, that leaves 6 - 5 = 1 second of<br/>
&gt; &gt; vulnerability to this happening.  If the time for the message<br/>
&gt; &gt; is 6 seconds or more, our invisibility can never flicker off<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it will *always* be &quot;refreshed&quot; before it can flicker<br/>
&gt; &gt; off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unless, of course, there&#39;s a check made every time the pulse happens to<br/>
&gt; see if it succeeds. I guess we will find out as more people put this new<br/>

became visible.<br/>
