their pet kills stuff too fast.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t go that far Kitasi.  Frankly I fight in groups without a druid or<br/>
ranger fairly regularly.  Besides, there are a bazillion people out there<br/>
who don&#39;t know how to play their class well.  They don&#39;t read lists like<br/>
this, frequent web sites or anything else.  It&#39;s not that hard to imagine<br/>
getting a druid in your group that doesn&#39;t know that a mage&#39;s earth pet is<br/>
gonna screw him up.  You&#39;re there with Chains when that happens.. and a lot<br/>
of other situations.  Chains is, imo, one of the defining songs of the bard<br/>
class and fits in with our crowd control skills.  Don&#39;t forget that Chains<br/>
has a whopping 30% mob slowdown to go along with it - that&#39;s like putting a<br/>
Runed Bolster Belt or Cloak of Flames on each of your meleers.<br/>
<br/>
The list of songs that I essentially never swap out (barring dragons, etc.)<br/>
at my level is Berserker, Chains, Pixie Strike, Clarity.  At 50 Verses of<br/>
Victory will swap in for Berserker.<br/>

&gt; So basically Chains is like bards in general?  An afterthought that&#39;s nice<br/>
&gt; to have when the real spells fail.  I waited 22 levels for this.  Sigh,<br/>
&gt; maybe I should just give in and play a necro so I can complain<br/>
&gt; about how my<br/>
&gt; 400 pt DoT&#39;s take a whole minute to happen and my 65 point<br/>
&gt; heal/DD&#39;s aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mana efficient because my pet keeps me from ever taking damage.  Sighs in<br/>
&gt; defeat.<br/>
