<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643097669">Followup.  The first set of data was with me singing Celerity<br/>
(the dam/sec figures do *not* reflect attack speedups), in a<br/>
configuration of 87 str and 119 dex (typo on the dex).  Last<br/>
night I tried it, this time singing Warsong and Chant of<br/>
Battle.  That gave me 161 str, 119 dex.  Again, the way I<br/>
processed the data removed any attack speedup component.  I<br/>
also went through and deleted data from times when Warsong or<br/>
Chant expired (and my str dropped below 161).<br/>
<br/>
With the Yak in my primary hand at 87 str, 119 dex, I got:<br/>
<br/>
Ykesha (8/24) in primary<br/>
9223 damage<br/>
508 hits (56.0%)<br/>
399 misses (44.0%)<br/>
20 procs unresisted<br/>
22 procs resisted<br/>
avg dam/hit = 18.2<br/>
melee damage = 4.24 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
melee damage = 7.56 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>
melee damage + procs = 4.93 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
proc rate = 1 per 51.8 sec (1 per 44.0 sec adjusted for Celerity)<br/>
          = 1 per 21.6 swings<br/>
<br/>
With the Yak in my primary hand at 161 str, 131 dex, I got:<br/>
<br/>
Ykesha (8/24) in primary<br/>
8339 damage<br/>
460 hits (57.5%)<br/>
340 misses (42.5%)<br/>
13 procs unresisted<br/>
17 procs resisted<br/>
avg dam/hit = 18.1<br/>
melee damage = 4.34 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
melee damage = 7.55 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>
melee damage + procs = 4.85 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
proc rate = 1 per 64.0 sec (1 per 51.2 sec adjusted for Warsong)<br/>
          = 1 per 26.7 swings<br/>
<br/>
So what does it all mean?  It means within the margin of error<br/>
of this sample, strength does absolutely nothing for damage.  <br/>
The only difference it made was that my max damage went from<br/>
33 to 37.  However, the frequency of these extra-high damage<br/>
hits was so low that they didn&#39;t affect the average.<br/>
<br/>
The extra dex from Chant does not seem to have made any<br/>
difference in the number of procs.  However, the sample size<br/>
is so low (30 and 42 procs) and the dex boost (12 points) so<br/>
small that I wouldn&#39;t consider this conclusive.  OTOH, 800 Yak<br/>
swings is about a half hour of continuous combat.  If it<br/>
didn&#39;t make a significant difference in that amount of time,<br/>
that means the effect, if present, is tiny.  Unless the AC<br/>
boost is significant, I&#39;m probably going to drop Chant in<br/>
favor of something like a damage shield.<br/>
<br/>
I did have a slightly higher hit% the second time around, but<br/>
again it&#39;s probably within the margin of error.<br/>
<br/>
The secondary weapon stats looked pretty much identical to my<br/>
previous test.  The only notable difference was I only dual<br/>
wielded 51% of the time.  Maybe the range on the piercer is<br/>
shorter or something - I spent a lot more time chasing the<br/>
Allizesaur around last night.<br/>
<br/>
These results pretty much agree with what other people (mostly<br/>
shamen, concerned that their buffs are &quot;useless&quot;) have been<br/>
finding.<br/>
