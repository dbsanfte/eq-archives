&gt; &gt; The only times I have trouble getting my pet to attack (with the 39<br/>
&gt; &gt; song) is if the command comes too close to a previous /pet command or<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m too far away from him to hear the message.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also have trouble with too many commands in one hot key.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I want to do is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/assist Fred<br/>
&gt;/pet attack<br/>
&gt;/say Pet is attacking %T<br/>
&gt;/pet target<br/>
&gt;/attack off<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But it rarely works.  In this case, what seems to get missed is the assist<br/>
&gt;portion.  It seems like there is a resolution time for assist and it hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;been resolved before the /pet attack, so my pet tells me &#39;that is not a<br/>
&gt;legal target master&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am trying to choose between separate Assist key (which I always have<br/>
&gt;anyway) or trying to add a pause in there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other thoughts?<br/>
