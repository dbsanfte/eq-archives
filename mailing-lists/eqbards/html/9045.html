<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177647506">I remember Bard Hate in my earlier years while hunting in Unrest.  While<br/>
camping on the left wall waiting for my group&#39;s puller to return with some<br/>
fair, I heard the shout &quot;Hag to zone&quot;.  At this time I was sing anthem to<br/>
ensure that my group was ready to handle the pull.  Now what did I see, a<br/>
paladin running out of the house over the railing of the porch with a hag<br/>
and two dry bones in tow.  Not really thinking for a second, I was totally<br/>
baffled when the hag stopped, turned and headed straight for me.  Of<br/>
course being level 21 at the time I could only survive 2 blasts of her<br/>
force shock and a couple hits from the carrion ghoul.  <br/>
<br/>
If this is not bard hate then I don&#39;t know what is.<br/>
