<div id="ygrps-yiv-421691410">Yeah, my 2 druid buds and I found out how powerful the two chants + the<br/>
tamborine can be when I hit 39 a few weeks ago.<br/>
Our method?  Root, then they fire off their best DoT&#39;s then med while I<br/>
stand back and rotate chants.  We have been giving the FV giants hell ever<br/>
since ;o)  (hint: one of the druids has the timing of Root down to almost an<br/>
art).  So by the time the big critter falls, the driuds are almost &quot;fm&quot;, and<br/>
we&#39;ve taken hardly any damage. :o)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] DOTs at 39<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I had an eye opening grouping experience yesterday, I&#39;d just like to share<br/>
&gt; it and get the more experienced bards comments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The group:<br/>
&gt; Elfson Allegro Lvl 39 half Bard (and a damn handsome man)<br/>
&gt; 41 Ranger<br/>
&gt; 35 Enchanter<br/>
&gt; 38? Druid<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For some reason they wanted to group in the dreadlands (3 of these were<br/>
&gt; guildies and the 4th was a friend).  I said we&#39;re probably over matched<br/>
&gt; there and won&#39;t do very well.  But they wanted to try it, so I agreed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I decide to go full DOT mode since I figured our only shot was to kill<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; suckers fast. (and I wanted to see if my damage calculations were close to<br/>
&gt; correct).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What came as a total shock to me was that the ranger (augmented/buffed,<br/>
&gt; wielding a yak and some weird spear/staff which he says is better off hand<br/>
&gt; weapon than yak) was unable to keep the monsters from agroing on me.  I<br/>
sung<br/>
&gt; 2 chants and Denon&#39;s using Nostrolo Tamborine and a normal horn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was it possible that I was outdamaging him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I was then I am pretty excited about this song combo.  Granted I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use Denon&#39;s in a dungeon (AOE damage bad!), but that could be replaced<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; an number of songs (I often use Melodic Binding in a multi pull dungeon<br/>
&gt; situation, the enchanters are quite grateful when the mobs that break mez<br/>
&gt; come running for me rather than them).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In any case with those 4 (low level for dreadlands) people we were able to<br/>
&gt; pull pretty much non stop, with the Ranger pulling anything but Ravishing<br/>
&gt; Drolvogs (Those football players hit HARD).  Needless to say the xp was<br/>
&gt; amazing (for an outdoor pull), I got like 1.5 of 39 in about 2 hours...  I<br/>
&gt; havent seen xp like that since I was doing the lvl 18-2? solo DOT attack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course at the end (&quot;last pull for me guys!&quot;) the new dragon was trained<br/>
&gt; to Karnor&#39;s and I got killed in his breath weapon (while getting a screen<br/>
&gt; shot!)<br/>
