<div id="ygrps-yiv-181060896">Yeah, it happens to all of us, and to other classes as well.  However, I<br/>
really think that Enchanters and Bards are the two most misunderstood classes.<br/>
The reason for that I think is that Enchanters and Bards (bards even moreso I<br/>
think) are really quite different from ALL of the other classes.  Our<br/>
abilities are quite unique.<br/>
<br/>
But WE shouldn&#39;t underestimate the other classes either.  We shouldn&#39;t feel<br/>
that just because we run the best, most versatile and most subtle class &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
that we know everything there is to know about the others.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
I have a 23rd level Wizard friend (damn nice guy) that is pretty darn handy at<br/>
melee.  I&#39;m not sure what stick he&#39;s carrying now, but if he&#39;s OOM or if the<br/>
fight isn&#39;t that tough and he doesn&#39;t wanna burn the mana he&#39;ll step up to the<br/>
plate and start swinging.  That guy hits for over 20 points a whack with that<br/>
damn thing, and his skill is high enough so that he genuinely contributes to<br/>
the melee damage.  &#39;Course if he gets hit a couple of times he has to bow<br/>
out - not many HPs himself.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Anyone else get this sort of thing happen to them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You mean group with an idiot?  No, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re the only one.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, so he wasn&#39;t an idiot, that&#39;s being cruel, but this happens all the<br/>
&gt; time, to people of all classes actually.  The only real hope is to explain<br/>
&gt; to the person what you were doing and why you were doing it and hope that he<br/>
&gt; learns.<br/>
