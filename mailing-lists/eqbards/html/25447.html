<div id="ygrps-yiv-689078518">3 high level groups?  I would guess that was before the zone was<br/>
&quot;nerfed&quot;....  I&#39;ve spent a goodly amount of time in the zone (haven&#39;t seen<br/>
shimmering spirits yet) - and seen mostly single other groups in there - so<br/>
I wonder if you really need all that.  Could be very deep however...<br/>

I was told about the &quot;walk&quot; trick and tried it, but it didn&#39;t seem to make<br/>
me run quite as fast as I&#39;m used to.  Granted, it was faster than trying the<br/>
use the drum normally.  I&#39;ll have to do some more testing to see if it&#39;s<br/>
anywhere near the speed of my Nostrolo Tambourine... hehe<br/>
<br/>
As for obtaining one, to be honest I wasn&#39;t able to attend the raid that it<br/>
dropped in.  My guild presented it to me as a gift.  According to<br/>
Allakhazam&#39;s site, it&#39;s an uncommon/rare drop off of a Shimmering Spirit,<br/>
which is an uncommon/rare spawn mob around level 52-ish in Siren&#39;s Grotto.<br/>
According to reports on Allakhazam&#39;s, it would probably be a safe assumption<br/>
that 3 level 50-60 groups can handle the area in which it spawns.</div>
