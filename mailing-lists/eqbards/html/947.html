<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200077287">Greetings fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
  I have been a lone wolf for the first part of my career, and believe I can make it to 20th level without the need of a party (currently 17th).  Tis a lonely life indeed, but my schedule seems to prohibit making long term ties with others.  As I approach 20th, I am looking to start grouping in the future.  However my lack of experience in group situations might endanger my comrades and myself.  Does anyone have a strategy guide for us minstrals?  If so I would be greatly interested in hearing your opinions and tactics.  I&#39;m looking for a &quot;whatever you do, don&#39;t ever play song &quot;XXX&quot; in a group situation in a dungeon!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your humble servant,<br/>
