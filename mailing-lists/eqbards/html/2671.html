&gt; I wonder if there is really anyone on this list who doesn&#39;t cheat.  For<br/>
&gt; example, what about the bug that makes up to 20 stacked items weigh the<br/>
&gt; same as just one?  How many of you exploit that bug on a daily basis to<br/>
&gt; carry more than your weight allowance?  Oh, is it just me?  Heh.  Oops.<br/>

around the minimum displayed weight value being 0.1.  I was<br/>
always miffed that I&#39;d be carrying just one of these items,<br/>
but I was being weighted as if I were carrying 20.  :-)<br/>
