<b>Subject:</b> UPDATE on bard songs (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-159974980">Okay, here&#39;s compendium of ideas.  Please comment,<br/>
refine, etc.  First issue however is a RFC:<br/>
<br/>
When Nameless went down (again :P) GM-Hideaki<br/>
(Nameless GM boss) was in channel Wazzap Hideaki! and<br/>
asked if anyone was a bard, I piped up and he said he<br/>
and GZ were brainstorming (who was immediately<br/>
upstairs from Hideaki) on bard song ideas for<br/>
expansion.  He for my input on the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. How would we feel about a PARTY BIND song, using a<br/>
very expensive reagent and mana cost.<br/>
--I told him that we did not want a bind song if it<br/>
was identical to casters, however if the song allowed<br/>
you to bind anyone anyplace (melees included) then we<br/>
would certainly welcome it, especially at higher (51+)<br/>
levels since expansion zones are rumored to be mammoth<br/>
in scale.<br/>
<br/>
2. How would we feel about party invis vs undead.<br/>
--I asked, &quot;doesn&#39;t clouding provided limited invis vs<br/>
undead?&quot;  His unequivocal answer was &quot;no.&quot;  Feel free<br/>
to inject more impolite comments here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:firehawk@...">firehawk@...</a> but I&#39;m trying very hard to help<br/>
since I really care about bards.  I told GM-Hideaki<br/>
we&#39;d like an upgrade to Clouding that combined invis,<br/>
invis vs undead and sneak (meaning no spell graphic)<br/>
since this would give us an ability no single caster<br/>
can provide (both invis types) and the no spell<br/>
graphic would be a boon to +PvP servers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to a compendium of ideas.  I am not making any<br/>
judgements on them, but I did take the liberty of<br/>
combining similar ideas and/or taking the most well<br/>
written version of an idea and posting that.  I will<br/>
attribute all song ideas to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqbards@onelist.com">eqbards@onelist.com</a> unless<br/>
you explicitly email me (privately if you want,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gww6e@...">gww6e@...</a>) to say otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
3. Upgraded charm.  Everyone and his brother (over 35<br/>
responses) wanted this and hey, I do too. :)<br/>
<br/>
4. Upgrade to clouding.  Nuff said, and I think I<br/>
summed it up that we&#39;d like a song that can provide<br/>
both types of invis.<br/>
<br/>
5. An improved damage shield.  This appears to be<br/>
drawing interest:<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Sonic Reflection<br/>
Brass<br/>
Gives all party members a damage reflection shield.<br/>
Causing a portion of the damage done to them in combat<br/>
(melee & non-melee) to be reflected back at the<br/>
attacker).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6. An improved AE DoT with added effect (stamina drain<br/>
being a common thread, the other was a lifetap<br/>
affect).  Question at large: do mobs have stamina and<br/>
if so, does it impact their ability to fight?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7. Upgrade to selo&#39;s OR remove hard speed cap.  I<br/>
personally want the cap removed vice burning another<br/>
spell slot on an upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
8. Upgrade to clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Cassandra&#39;s Clarified Elegy<br/>
Provides clarity2 (whatever that might be) +<br/>
(limited?) elegy effect.<br/>
<br/>
9. Upgrade to MR debuffing abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Fog of War. AE snare. AE slow attack speed. AE<br/>
Dot. AE magic debuff (30 pts at least). effect of fog?<br/>
<br/>
10. One-way teleport (self only?  to bard guild?).<br/>
(Please no flames on this, I can already see it<br/>
coming)<br/>
<br/>
11. Mem blur song.<br/>
<br/>
Fitful&#39;s Forgetful Improv<br/>
Voice<br/>
Causes the target to become so fixated on the improv<br/>
that it forgets whatever else it was dong.  Drawback:<br/>
Bard possibly left on hate list.<br/>
<br/>
12. Upgraded Atk Song<br/>
Since we are out speed buffed by enchanters, a<br/>
straight addition to Atk with an added component. <br/>
Most commonly heard suggestion: rune type shielding. <br/>
Other suggestions: massive ac bonus, massive<br/>
regeneration effect, massive MR buff.<br/>
<br/>
13. A proc song<br/>
The Chromatic Scale<br/>
Level: 36th<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Description: A chromatic scale is all the notes an<br/>
instrument is capable of producing, generally played<br/>
starting from the lowest to the highest and then back<br/>
down; slurred up (ligato), tongued down (staccato).<br/>
The Chromatic Scale when song by the bard would act<br/>
much as the Vampiric Embrace necro spell in that it<br/>
imparts a proc to melee attacks however the twist is<br/>
that there would be 5 different types which randomly<br/>
kick off: magic, fire, cold, disease and poison based<br/>
attacks. These would be DD&#39;s - there by filling in our<br/>
missing DD ability, but in a uniquely bard fashion<br/>
(group based, becomes more powerful as you add members<br/>
and err... randomly good -- maybe. hehe).  Verant of<br/>
course would come up with some cute little chromatic<br/>
sparkles to surround us and multi colored blasts as<br/>
the proc goes off. :)<br/>
<br/>
PS: For those D&D fans, recall the Chromatic* line of<br/>
spells. <br/>
<br/>
14. A bard additive song<br/>
Cinda&#39;s Companion Cantata<br/>
Level: 49th+<br/>
Skill: Variable (see below)<br/>
Description: A cantata is a composition scored for<br/>
many parts at once, incorporating both voice and<br/>
instrumental accompaniment, hence this song would<br/>
allow bards in the same group to ally their voices in<br/>
song to intensify the effects of a common song - to<br/>
&quot;stack&quot; the same song, perhaps with at<br/>
100*(2-((6-n)^(1/6)))% effectiveness, where n is the<br/>
number of bards playing cantata. Yes, this could be<br/>
exceptionally powerful, what with twisting and all,<br/>
but this could easily be limited to only effect the<br/>
&quot;top&quot; bard song in the spell list of the lead singer,<br/>
whilst the &quot;recovery&quot; period of stopping the song<br/>
would be such that twisting wouldn&#39;t be possible if<br/>
you were a cantata player.<br/>
Example: A group composed of 1 warrior and 2 bards<br/>
stops to rest. Bard 1<br/>
begins to sing Hymn, only to be joined in song by bard<br/>
2 with Cinda&#39;s<br/>
Cantata - boosting regeneration by their now intensity<br/>
music (by the SWAG<br/>
formula above that would be a +69%).<br/>
Full stacking numbers would be:<br/>
n    +%<br/>
---    -----<br/>
1    69<br/>
2    74<br/>
3    80<br/>
4    88<br/>
5    100<br/>
<br/>
15. Song of Silence<br/>
Solon&#39;s Song of Silence<br/>
Effect: NON-PARTY: Silence.<br/>
<br/>
PBAE, fixed radius, 2 tick negate casting.<br/>
NPC has one chance to resist intial and to break free<br/>
each tick there after. Lute for enhanced effects. Save<br/>
versus Magic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Comments?  I pulled a few of these from the eqbards<br/>
archives (btw the onelist search facilities need some<br/>
serious help).  Please no flames on this and I thank<br/>
everyone for the mountain of responses.  If I missed<br/>
your email, I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
