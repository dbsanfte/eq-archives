magic-based attacks (lightning, force, charm, probably root<br/>
and DoTs).  Spells can also be fire or cold based, and magic<br/>
resist will not help against those.  That&#39;s why I recommend<br/>
Elemental Rhythms over Guardian Rhythms if you&#39;re only going<br/>
to be singing/playing one Rhythm song.<br/>
