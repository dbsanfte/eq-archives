<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538213396">On the topic of playing nice,,, last night my almost<br/>
17lvl enchanter was trying to kill gnolls in highpass<br/>
with a 19 druid for a partner.  We were doing fine,<br/>
till this Lvl 50 Necro arrived and said... &quot;sorry to<br/>
do this to you guys, but i need the faction&quot; he then<br/>
proceeded to kill everything in site till i gave up<br/>
and left 30 minutes later.   That is in reallity how<br/>
sharing works...<br/>

&gt; I believe that his implication was that players can,<br/>
&gt; if they wish to, agree to <br/>
&gt; abide by a list.  He did not say what would happen<br/>
&gt; if one of the parties did NOT <br/>
&gt; agree to the list.  Numerous postings make it clear<br/>
&gt; that guides/GMs can, if they <br/>
&gt; wish, impose some other rule even if the list rule<br/>
&gt; has been used for months in <br/>
&gt; that particular area.  And they have.<br/>
