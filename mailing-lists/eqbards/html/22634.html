<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022919881">last weekend when we cleared VP, after each fight tons of people noticed<br/>
faction hits while the weekend before only a handful, 6 or so, noticed.  an<br/>
officer asked whoever got a faction hit to say &quot;yes&quot; in guildchat and there<br/>
were 26 yes&#39;s.  after that trip i went from Warmly to Threateningly, pretty<br/>
much everyone else is KOS or close as well.  unfortunately it&#39;s just not an<br/>
issue anymore if you wanna fight there.  like you said, it&#39;s only a matter<br/>
of time =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hrrm didn&#39;t know they changed size of hate list. I guess that <br/>
&gt; explains why <br/>
&gt; last nuke to hit doesn&#39;t get kill most of the time anymore. <br/>
&gt; =) I&#39;ve survived <br/>
&gt; quite a few fights, but for some reason haven&#39;t taken faction <br/>
&gt; hits most of <br/>
&gt; the time. I am still warmly (or kindly I forget) to Kunark dragons. I <br/>
&gt; specifically remember standing under Silverwing and watching <br/>
&gt; Alloria get the <br/>
&gt; killshot (of all people a cleric) while I was grouped with <br/>
&gt; her. No faction <br/>
&gt; hit whatsoever. Later I definitely got a hit from Phara Dar, <br/>
&gt; but I am still <br/>
&gt; not KoS. Only a matter of time I&#39;m sure.<br/>
