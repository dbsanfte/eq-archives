&gt; Last night, I was grouped with a necromancer in MM.  There were only a<br/>

will see a skeleton standing near the zone.  Clicking on it<br/>
reveals it&#39;s the pet of a high level mob somewhere inside the<br/>
castle.  I assume &quot;inside the castle&quot; is right behind the zone<br/>
wall.  If you attack the pet (or hit anything inside the<br/>
castle with an AE spell/song through the walls), the stuff you<br/>
can&#39;t see will aggro on you.<br/>

safe spots to kill mobs while the mobs were &quot;stuck&quot; trying to<br/>
path to them.  Verant fixed it by making it so if the mobs<br/>
couldn&#39;t path to you after a short period of time, they just<br/>
teleport to you.  So you hit something through the walls, the<br/>
gargoyles were close enough to go aggro on you, couldn&#39;t find<br/>
a quick route to you, and so teleported right on top of you.<br/>

A side effect of this is that Screech is no longer as<br/>
effective in dungeons if you have a long run to the zone.  <br/>
You will scare off a bunch of mobs who run the other way, and<br/>
20 seconds later they all teleport on top of you.<br/>

LOS, you got no &quot;mob begins to cast a spell&quot; messages.  You<br/>
should&#39;ve gotten a &quot;Your skin freezes over&quot; message or<br/>
something, but I&#39;ve not gotten that several times.  Maybe LOS<br/>
has something to do with it.  (It&#39;s high time we got messages<br/>
indicating how much damage we&#39;re taking from spells anyhow).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t use AE around the zone point (truth be told, there are<br/>
only about 3 or 4 places where I *would* use AE in that zone),<br/>
and only attack stuff that attacks you.  The skeleton pet on<br/>
the wrong side of the wall will not join in your fights at the<br/>
zone unless you hit it first.<br/>
