<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396344525">the last lambent bp i saw auctioned was in north fp for 1300pp.  3-5k is<br/>
nuts.  now i did get all the lambent when the quests came out, but i never<br/>
used it and i traded it all (minus helm of course) last month for a runed<br/>
cowl.  wonder what you all think of that?  took me a couple days to decide<br/>
but i buckled.<br/>

&gt; The other day in Kelethin a level 6 bard twink offered to buy <br/>
&gt; every piece of<br/>
&gt; lambent armor I was wearing ( I have complete set minus 2 <br/>
&gt; pieces).  He offered<br/>
&gt; me a helluva lot of money for it all.  I laughed in his face. <br/>
&gt;  Told him that I<br/>
&gt; had been working on completing the quests ever since they <br/>
&gt; came out in the patch.<br/>
&gt; No way was I gonna sell it and do the quests all over again.  <br/>
&gt; He bumped his<br/>
&gt; offer by 1000PP.  Put him on the /ignore list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night was running through EC on my way to Solusek Temple <br/>
&gt; to complete the<br/>
&gt; lambent breastplate quest.  Someone was auctioning a lambent <br/>
&gt; breastplate for<br/>
&gt; sell.  Sent him a /tell that I was interested in knowing his <br/>
&gt; asking price.  He<br/>
&gt; said 3000-5000 PP or items of equal trade. Also told me that <br/>
&gt; he had already sold<br/>
&gt; three breastplates for that price.  I would have thought that <br/>
&gt; they sold for no<br/>
&gt; more than 1000PP.  Only cost me 270PP to buy the two rubies.  <br/>
&gt; Guess these newbie<br/>
&gt; bard twinks have a lot of money to throw around.  <br/>
