<div id="ygrps-yiv-914015690">To the tune of &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot; by Abba.<br/>
<br/>
I sing all night, I sing all day, to please the group I&#39;m with today,<br/>
Ain&#39;t it sad.<br/>
And still they never seem to see the mobs all aggro fast on me,<br/>
Hurts me bad.<br/>
I&#39;ve had enough, I&#39;m getting out,<br/>
I give the zone another shout,<br/>
&quot;A Bard? Which level? 32? That&#39;s great, your mana song will do...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mana, mana, mana,<br/>
Screw the banter,<br/>
Just sing Clarity.<br/>
Mana, mana, mana,<br/>
There&#39;s no Enchanter,<br/>
But the Bard comes free.<br/>
Boo-hoo-ooooo<br/>
They don&#39;t want me to twist,<br/>
They just want a dose of mana,<br/>
Playing constantly.<br/>
<br/>
A decent group is hard to find but they want crack most of the time,<br/>
Ain&#39;t it sad.<br/>
And if they happen to want me it&#39;s not for wit or personality,<br/>
Drives me mad.<br/>
So I must leave, I&#39;ll have to go,<br/>
&quot;No. I&#39;m a Bard, I don&#39;t have SoW&quot;,<br/>
Equip my drums and fire up Selo&#39;s, I leave behind those crack-whore<br/>
fellows...<br/>
<br/>
Mana, mana, mana,<br/>
Screw the banter,<br/>
Just sing Clarity.<br/>
Mana, mana, mana,<br/>
There&#39;s no Enchanter,<br/>
But the Bard comes free.<br/>
Boo-hoo-ooooo<br/>
They don&#39;t want me to twist,<br/>
They just want a dose of mana,<br/>
Playing constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Mana, mana, mana,<br/>
Give up playing a<br/>
Bard at thirty-three.<br/>
Mana, mana, mana,<br/>
You&#39;ll become a<br/>
Mana battery.<br/>
Boo-hoo-oooo<br/>
They don&#39;t want other songs,<br/>
They just want to hear that mana,<br/>
Playing constantly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Comments appreciated. :)<br/>
