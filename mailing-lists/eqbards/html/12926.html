Snare is to Chain.  Bard mes (Pixie Strike) and Chain can fail<br/>
at any moment after it&#39;s applied.  Enchanter mez and<br/>
druid/ranger Snare have a fixed minimum duration.  If it<br/>
sticks, you&#39;re guaranteed that minimum duration.<br/>

I don&#39;t know the mechanics of high level enthrall (my<br/>
enchanter is only level 18), but from what GZ says, I&#39;d guess<br/>
there&#39;s a chance of the spell having no effect even if it<br/>
isn&#39;t resisted.  Unfortunately, since bards have to refresh<br/>
the song more frequently (and it can fail at any time), the<br/>
chances of bards running into this problem are much much<br/>
higher.  If I were designing the game, I would never use the<br/>
same failure rate for both bard and enchanter.  It would<br/>
either be outlandishly low for one, or outlandishly high for<br/>
the other.<br/>
