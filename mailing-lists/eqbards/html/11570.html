<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119276638">Yes, he drops the Mask of Deception.<br/>
It does the same thing as the deceiver mask, except it has to be worn to<br/>
work.<br/>
Bard/Rogue only.<br/>
<br/>
[And if it pleases ye, if anyone can fulfill my request, don&#39;t let this get<br/>
into a debate about the new mask, please.]<br/>

What do yo mean by &quot;NEW mask?&quot;  Does the assassin drop a different mask than<br/>
the Guise of the Deceiver now?<br/>

I have a boon to ask of ye, me friends.<br/>
I have need of a better map to the ruins of lower Guk. The maps I have found<br/>
from the many cartographers around fail to lead me true.<br/>
Any help you may offer in this manner would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

[OOC: The maps out there that I have found fail to show the Assassin room. I<br/>
would love to be able to get there, or near, to get a basalt Carapace to<br/>
wear (and perhaps one of the new masks)<br/>
I was in lower Guk much of last night, and both were up for free loot, but I<br/>
could not find a guide to the assassin room. by the time I did find a guide<br/>
(a few hours later), There were only 20 people in the zone, and bad things<br/>
were everywhere. I did get greaves and gauntlets. Much better to wear than<br/>
bronze]<br/>
