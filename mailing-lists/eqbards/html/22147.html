<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356799485">I&#39;m a Master Smith on Tarrew Mar....mostly I get the dyes myself, but I will buy some.  I only pay 5-10pp for &quot;common&quot; dyes (iron and russet oxide), 10-20 for the uncommons (permafrost, sarcoscypha, and evergreen leaves ┬ù note on the leaves...these are not that rare anymore...eqtraders.com has a nice little list of their /locs on the spawns...I refuse to pay more then 20pp for them, it&#39;s a rip off if you pay more), and 20+ depending on what I have for the rares (charcoal mainly...I have never seen a jack-o-lantern fungus...so I might pay out the wazoo for one :).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found the best way to get the dyes is to give a discount to the person I&#39;m selling the armor to if they provide the dye themselves.<br/>

P.S.  I got my Nostrolo Tambourine last night (only took us 20 minutes to get the scorp coin, but 2 hours to get the EJ coin...grrr).  And it&#39;s a great drum!<br/>

P.P.S. (is that right?)  I think I made a perfect suit of &quot;Bardic Armor&quot;...image at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/bardic.jpg">http://www.clandlc.com/bardic.jpg</a>  Wish I had some yellow though...that&#39;d make the armor &quot;brighter&quot;.<br/>
