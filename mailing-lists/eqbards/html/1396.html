 </span></blockquote>I have my entire first bank taken up with songs (I wish it had 8 slots!!!), <br/>
my second bank has inventory/weapon boxes for the quick switching, the third <br/>
has miscellaneous skills. I find that having songs in hotkeys makes twisting <br/>
easier, especially when laggy spells start flying and slow down my mouse <br/>
cursor (which I hate). I haven&#39;t setup any macro messages, but i probly <br/>
should. Would be nice to have an /assist button, and a host of macros such <br/>
as &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE!!!&quot; or &quot;ZONE OUT!&quot;<br/>
