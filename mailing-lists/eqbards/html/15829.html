<div id="ygrps-yiv-197235395">Hmm. Does he mean salable as in for plat? Or auctionable on ebay? If<br/>
it&#39;s the latter I think the I Agree you click every time you log in<br/>
specifically says it&#39;s not. However, if he could make the case that<br/>
Verant, by not even attempting to use the avenues Ebay makes available<br/>
to intellectual property owners to stop these sales, is giving tacit<br/>
approval, then he might get somewhere. It would be nice to see someone<br/>
actually try this, if nothing else to see Verant forced to give more<br/>
than lip service to shutting it down.<br/>
<br/>
As for constitutional rights, reread your constitution. It specificly<br/>
says the government can&#39;t stop you from speaking, it says nothing about<br/>
what a private company does on thier own property. I think there has<br/>
been some state level judgements that stopped shopping malls, for<br/>
instance from limiting people&#39;s speech, as the malls were ruled to be a<br/>
public place, so you&#39;d have to get Norrath ruled the same.<br/>

&gt; It is property, according to definitions under US Law.  One of my gaming<br/>
&gt; buddies, who is a lawyer, came up with an even more interesting proposition.<br/>
&gt; If my equipment is saleable my me, and therefore my property, if Verant<br/>
&gt; decides to deny me access to that equipment without due process, they are<br/>
&gt; guilty of denying me my own property without such due process, which is<br/>
&gt; under US law a violation of my civil rights.  I may have the wording not<br/>
&gt; entirely correct on this as it is from memory, but that&#39;s about how our<br/>
&gt; attorney gaming friend laid it out.  Interestingly as such, Verant also<br/>
&gt; cannot ban someone for anything they say while online.  Despite the fact<br/>
&gt; that it is in the TOS that you cannot say certain things without being<br/>
&gt; banned, US civil liberties laws specifically prohibit anyone from<br/>
&gt; voluntarily abrogating their own constitutional rights except in cases of<br/>
&gt; national security.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Makes one think doesn&#39;t it.<br/>
