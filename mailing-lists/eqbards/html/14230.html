<div id="ygrps-yiv-689169880">I was roaming around the net and I found these old pictures Sylly<br/>
  took.  I have some of my own, but these show the outside perspective.<br/>

  I think I was L19 in these pictures.  Full bronze which I worked<br/>
  my ass of for from the first wave of L50s on Innoruuk.  This is<br/>
  when a bronze bp would run about 75-100pp.<br/>
<br/>
  I put over 20 gnolls to sleep, ranging from scrawny to elite.<br/>
  I lost maybe 2 or 3 bubbles of health for the 2 or 3 mins I stood<br/>
  there holding them still.  That&#39;s right, completely still.  Hardly<br/>
  anything attacked me, they stayed asleep until I stopped playing.<br/>
<br/>
  This is how it used to be.  Verant (and GZ) blatantly lied that<br/>
  they haven&#39;t adjusted this song since release.  I tried to sleep<br/>
  off a few skeletons yesterday and I could not keep the group <br/>
  controlled at all.  The programmers didn&#39;t just put in the failed<br/>
  to mesmerize message, about 4 or 5 months ago they definitely F&#39;d<br/>
  this song.<br/>
