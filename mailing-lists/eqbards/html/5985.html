<b>Subject:</b> RE: thoughts on screaming mace? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-106913437">I also picked up a screaming mace in the last 2 weeks and when I began using<br/>
it at level 24 my 1H-Blunt skill was about 35.  The weapon NEVER started to<br/>
proc until my skill got up into the 70+ range and now since it is over 100,<br/>
I also find that it usually procs at least once per battle.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a combination of level, weapon skill, and DEX play into this.  Another<br/>
thing is that I had the shaman DEX buff (don&#39;t know if it is monkey or cat)<br/>
last night and my DEX was into the upper 20&#39;s and the mace proc&#39;d several<br/>
times per battle. <br/>

&gt; I use a Screaming Mace and it procs a lot at 16th level Dex <br/>
&gt; 112.  I see it<br/>
&gt; proc every fight and most fights it procs several times.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve even had it<br/>
&gt; proc on three sucessive attacks.  I have spent entire fights <br/>
&gt; yaulped for<br/>
&gt; over a minute.  Not sure why you aren&#39;t seeing many procs, <br/>
&gt; but could just be<br/>
&gt; some bad days of clumpy random number generation.  <br/>
