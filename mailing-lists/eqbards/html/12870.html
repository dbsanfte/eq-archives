<b>Subject:</b> Enchanters vs Bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938442633">IMO, the best thing you could possible do is find a good enchanter to make<br/>
friends with and group with him on a contiuous basis.  Bard and enchanters<br/>
go together like peas and carrots.  The only other class as beneficial to a<br/>
bard&#39;s continued health is a cleric.  But with a good enchanter, the less<br/>
you need a good cleric around (still nice to have though). <br/>
<br/>
What I find is that with a good enchanter in the party, I get to use songs<br/>
that I normally don&#39;t get to play with that much because I had to worry<br/>
about crowd control.  Bad pull+me doing crowd control=me usually dying.<br/>
With a good enchanter, bad pull+me buffing party+enchanter doing crowd<br/>
control=no one dying<br/>

&gt; subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the incompatability of enchanters<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game that work together as<br/>
&gt; poorly as these two?<br/>
