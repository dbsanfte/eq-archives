&gt; &gt;Ok, we&#39;re wandering again (and I&#39;ve been one of the worst offenders).<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;alway pointed out to people that bard kiting requires the mob to be in<br/>
&gt; &gt;bellow<br/>
&gt; &gt;range, and that is short enough to  A.  Keep it from dumping on somebody,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and B.  be a decent bit of risk.  Still tedious as anything though :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I just dumped EQ_shamans because the whining over there was irking<br/>
&gt; &gt;me so much that my aggravation spilled over here.  My fault, sorry.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;On bard related issues, if they did the same thing you suggest to our<br/>
damage<br/>
&gt; &gt;songs, how much use would they be in a group?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If your group is able to deal with multiple deep reds to the point where<br/>
&gt; Chords (or Denon&#39;s) is a primary song, perhaps we need to re-examine your<br/>
&gt; methods.  Both Chords and Denon&#39;s should be wonderful for white/black and<br/>
&gt; below, and somewhat useful vs. yellow.  But to allow one song to equally<br/>
&gt; effect multiple reds is a tad ... overkill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Err, you&#39;re right.  I was trying to make an analogy to another class that<br/>
is heavily dependent on their dot&#39;s, and already not the most group oriented<br/>
class.  Necros aren&#39;t bringing much to the party to start with, make it too<br/>
tough for them to stick a dot and .... ?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;d imagine that, if your party has multiple wht/blk + mobs on it,<br/>
and<br/>
your trying to use CoD or DDD, then you&#39;re on the way to corpse recovery :)<br/>
