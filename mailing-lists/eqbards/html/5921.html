<div id="ygrps-yiv-575528218">Good thing they remembered to seal that cave off or you would have run<br/>
&#39;behind the world&#39; like I did in Butcherblock.  Eventually you run out of<br/>
terrain to stand on the back of and fall to the bottom of the world.  The<br/>
server will then relocate you to &#39;a safe point&#39;, infortunately in<br/>
Butcherblock &#39;a safe point&#39; is apparently several miles above sea level.  I<br/>
promptly fell for 32000 points of damage.  And no, at least in EQ, you don&#39;t<br/>
die before you hit the ground.  Interestingly it did take me several seconds<br/>
to hit the ground, too bad I don&#39;t have levitate yet.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note it was cool to see &#39;behind the sets&#39; so to speak.  Made me<br/>
feel like I was in an old Hollywood western in some storefront ghost town.<br/>
If anyone is curious and wants to see this send me a reply and I&#39;ll tell you<br/>
how to get there.<br/>

On the topic of strange bugs, here is an amusing one:<br/>
<br/>
If you are familiar with the Unrest Zone, you are aware of how you run down<br/>
the twisty tunnel between Cauldron and Unrest and the zone point is in the<br/>
tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
I was standing just around the second turn in the tunnel in Unrest having<br/>
just zoned in and heading for the courtyard when someone yelled &quot;train to<br/>
zone!&quot; so I stopped and waited.  Around the next corner came 2 tentacle<br/>
terrors and one of them ran straight at me, hit me with that special attack<br/>
they have and threw me against the wall toward the direction I had come<br/>
from.  The I regained my bearings and it hit me again, threw me down the<br/>
tunnel against another wall and came charging at me for another go.<br/>
<br/>
I decide now is a good time to turn tail and run, zone to safety and wait<br/>
out the chaos - so I turn the next corner and there is a dead end...no<br/>
zone...a flat wall in front of me!  I get smacked by the tentacles again,<br/>
and again up against the wall and realize in a split second that they<br/>
knocked me PAST the zone point so I had to turn around and head the opposite<br/>
direction back INTO unrest and as I rounded the corner I zoned into Cauldron<br/>
with 2 bubbles of health.<br/>
<br/>
Crazy place...awful fun though ;-)<br/>
