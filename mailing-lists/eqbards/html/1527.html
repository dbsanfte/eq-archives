<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358980507">The mana using song (And that&#39;s the one I refered to a while back) was<br/>
planned on being an AOE Direct Damage song, doing 400 damage to up to four<br/>
targets.<br/>
<br/>
The catch was, it used almost all the mana a typical bard of that level<br/>
(42+) would have.  Since bards don&#39;t get meditate, even with Clarity it<br/>
would take a long while before the bard was able to sing that song again.<br/>
Essentially, it&#39;s not a song, it&#39;s a spell, in the conventional sense.<br/>
<br/>
Why this restriction?  Bards are not meant to be nukers.  This is a last<br/>
ditch, use it when the chips are down, make or break, type of song.  At that<br/>
level range, 400 damage isn&#39;t a whole lot, any caster worth his salt can do<br/>
that with a quarter bar of mana.  This is a way to give a bard some higher<br/>
level punch, without drastically changing the face of the class.<br/>

&gt;Was this change even implemented on the test server yet? If so, does<br/>
&gt;anyone play on the test server? I am curious to find out what songs<br/>
&gt;they would make require mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On a different note, would any of the bards here who play on<br/>
&gt;Cazic-Thule be interested in starting some sort of bard&#39;s guild? Just<br/>
&gt;an idea.<br/>
