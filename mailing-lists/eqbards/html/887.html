<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415719030">Ack!  I find this very disturbing.  What is it exactly, about bards at the<br/>
30+ level, that makes them so godawful?  With dual wield and the ability to<br/>
wear plate, I would think a bard could actually hold his or her own at least<br/>
as a fighter.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect it&#39;s just powergamers not wanting a jack-of-all-trades, but the<br/>
characters who can do the most damage standing behind those who can take the<br/>
most beating.   Ah well, one day I&#39;ll be level 50 too.  And know what?  So<br/>
will those guys.<br/>
