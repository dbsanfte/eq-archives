<b>Subject:</b> Re: Poor Foraging? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-387102823">Here&#39;s a little test that I used to see how efficient my forage was:<br/>
<br/>
Buy 20 food and 20 waters<br/>
Put them in the bottom 2 slots of a pack in the bottom of your inventory.<br/>
Put the Forage Skill in one of your primary Hot Keys<br/>
Hit Forage as often as it comes available.<br/>
Put food or water in the same pack as the 20 you previously bought, but<br/>
above them.<br/>
Now, over time, you can see just how efficient your Forage is.... If you run<br/>
low on the bought food or water, you know you&#39;re not keeping up.  And, over<br/>
time, you can see how fast you go thru the store bought supplies.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, I NEVER dipped into the store bought food (except maybe<br/>
right at the start when I had ONLY store bought food).  I even had enough to<br/>
occassionally give to my girlfriend.  Not enough to keep her fully supplied<br/>
on food, but enough to give her a stack of 20 to help her not have to buy<br/>
all the time.  On water, it was a different story, I went thru the bought<br/>
water slowly.  I would build up a supply of water, then go right through it<br/>
and into the bought food.  Funny thing is I seemed to forage water better in<br/>
Oasis.  : )<br/>

&gt; I have forage maxed, and hardly ever succesfully forage.  It leveled so<br/>
&gt; slowly that i put about 20 practice points into it (I still have about 30<br/>
&gt; points).  I get water so seldom that i always buy milk.  I usually get<br/>
&gt; grapes, and they don&#39;t always stack together.  Forage is a letdown for me.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hehe, less than 50%, he says.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would guess my forage works about 5% to 10% at best.  I&#39;ve got it up in<br/>
&gt; &gt;the high 30&#39;s (not maxed at 40 yet).<br/>
&gt; &gt;It seems to take FOREVER to get a skill increase.  I never forage enough<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Forage is not useful?!!!  Please!  I&#39;ve heard several<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;people complain about this in this thread.  I never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have to buy food!  I think that is extremely useful.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Granted, once you get to higher levels it isn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;food is some huge expense.  But it is something you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have to remember to buy if you are a class without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;forage capabilities.  Me?  I just click forage when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;remember and there is food.  Heck, it probably works<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;less than 50% of the time but it definitely produces a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;big enough stream of food to keep my supplies up.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I think that&#39;s the major complaint - we get all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; these neato &#39;other&#39; class<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; skills - but our caps are so low - it makes you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wonder why they bothered? I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; or forage - but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   The other thought i have to add here is that like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tracking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;for druids...its a special skill.  we get it at a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; level and it never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;advances..it caps at 20 and when we get it that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the skill we get it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;at.  Is it possible that bards get forage and its<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; at skill lvl 40 when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;we get it.  Just a thought...  oh yeah and skill<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cap for druids is 200<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;i believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
