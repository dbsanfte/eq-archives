<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lambent armor - what I did last night (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346625437">i also completed the breastplate quest and got nothing.  i spoke to 3 guides<br/>
but they all said i need to speak to the server GM today after 2pm.  i<br/>
successfully made a ruby lambent from Valissia giving her 2 rubies and a<br/>
lambent stone.  i gave Cryssia the ruby lambent, basalt carapace, and lute<br/>
of the gypsy princess and got nothing.  now Cryssia asks for a gypsy lute<br/>
from the castle of mistmoore.  how could there be another lute from<br/>
mistmoore???  i asked one of the guides if they would change that item after<br/>
patch and he thinks it is unlikely.  that can be the only possiblity or the<br/>
quest is broken.  i will find out.  gonna head to perma tonight for icy<br/>
greaves, i have the shin greaves from guk.  grats on the arms Elwyn.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a<br/>
&gt; side note, a bard on our server tried to make the breastplate, but got<br/>
&gt; nothing.  He says the breastplate quest is bugged, but it <br/>
&gt; could just be that<br/>
&gt; his faction was too low because I *know* he hailed that <br/>
&gt; efreeti who lowers<br/>
&gt; your faction when you try and talk to him.<br/>
&gt; All the components you need to collect are LORE and NO DROP, <br/>
&gt; except for the<br/>
&gt; lambent stones which are just LORE.<br/>
&gt; If people are interested, I&#39;ll post more info as I find it.<br/>
