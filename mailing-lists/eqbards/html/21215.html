 </span></blockquote> &quot;BUMP !&quot; Tim. AND you have to figure in that Chant of Battle is a Drum<br/>
song that at my level 48 is giving a plus 37 STR and plus 34 AC ! I just<br/>
tested it with my Nostrolo. Tambourine. I am not a instrument switcher<br/>
in the heat of battle so Berserker&#39;s only gives them 17 STR and 16 AC.<br/>
What I love with is it combines with #47 Niv&#39;s to give a combined STR of<br/>
around 50 STR  :)<br/>
  <br/>
 But your right about one thing. I is really hard now to figure out what<br/>
to sing. Last night in the Dead Captain room in Karnor&#39;s I good bored<br/>
buffing the Monk and Pally and decided to go all offensive with my 3<br/>
Chant songs. I didn&#39;t say anything but after a couple of crits &quot;died&quot;<br/>
quietly our Group leader said &quot;I don&#39;t know what yer doing Moonie but<br/>
what ever it is KEEP IT UP !&quot;  ..hehe, I should have said &quot;You want mana<br/>
in battle too now ?&quot;<br/>
