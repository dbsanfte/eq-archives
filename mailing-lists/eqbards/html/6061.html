<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261468514"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;This has probably been asked before, but HOW IN THE<br/>
&gt;&gt;WORLD can one practice Brass?  It seems that unless<br/>
&gt;&gt;you are actually damaging something, brass skill won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;go up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it goes up without damaging things.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The Arena + A brass horn + DDD + 4-8 hours = max brass skill.<br/>

I went and stood in a corner out in the newbie area of N. Qeynos to raise<br/>
mine, I MIGHT have killed snakes and rats and gnoll pups, but I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
know as I was sleeping *laughs*<br/>
<br/>
Several levels later I decided to top it off again, I just stood behind a<br/>
tree in E Karana near the High Pass hold zone...<br/>
