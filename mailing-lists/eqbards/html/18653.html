<div id="ygrps-yiv-40317129">It&#39;s unfortunate that the only ways to gain experience in EQ are by slaying<br/>
monsters and completing pre-fab quests. There&#39;s little incentive for doing<br/>
anything else. I spent two hours last night helping some poor soul locate<br/>
and retrieve his multiple corpses from deep in a hostile zone where he&#39;d<br/>
wandered accidentally. In a conventional RPG, the task would certainly have<br/>
warranted an XP award. Not so in EQ, where one has to be satisfied with<br/>
whatever enjoyment one gains from helping out those in need and from<br/>
roleplaying. Not that Verant makes roleplaying easy, with such things as<br/>
limited emotes and crappy macro capabilities. For instance, I&#39;d love to be<br/>
able to type &quot;/play&quot; to play whatever instrument I have equipped without any<br/>
magical effects, it&#39;d be nice if I could target a chair or a barstool and<br/>
sit down on it, and I&#39;d like to be able to script a song or a ballad to play<br/>
during those long boat rides. Everything in the game is so damn utilitarian.<br/>
Maybe we should just change the acronym to &quot;MMOG&quot;.<br/>
