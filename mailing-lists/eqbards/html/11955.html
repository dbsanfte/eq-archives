&gt; You folks are trying to justify the DT saying that he&#39;s a god<br/>
&gt; and should have it.  That&#39;s fine and good, but if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use it like a being of super-intelligence, then I don&#39;t see it<br/>
&gt; being much different than death by router crash - i.e. it gets<br/>
&gt; applied more or less randomly and without reason.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; justify either being necessary for the game IMHO.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes you just have to use your imagination on these things.<br/>
<br/>
Lets imagine for a moment, ...<br/>
He has the power, but the inability to control it.  Thus he says<br/>
Finger of Death, and mumbles something, and someone dies, he can&#39;t<br/>
control it.  Obviously this god isn&#39;t the super supreme god.<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t do it constantly, it has a nice recharge rate like <br/>
some of our spells. ... Maybe it even randomly comes back to him.<br/>
<br/>
Use your imagination some to think why he might act like he is...</div>
