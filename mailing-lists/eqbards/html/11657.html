<div id="ygrps-yiv-114255239">I agree - appears the same braintrust that was in charge of the pottery<br/>
debacle had their fingers in here.<br/>
<br/>
One of EQ shining qualities - is it ENCOURAGES folks to group and<br/>
cooperate. Giving one class the means to preloot as it were - is certainly<br/>
going to make them much less popular when gathering up a team.<br/>
<br/>
Rogues had too much money?  Ummm - there is not a working economy yet -<br/>
money becomes useless after a point - unless and UNTIL there is a real<br/>
working economy this is really a nonissue.<br/>
<br/>
They used the same logic when they gutted the tradeskills - pitiful little<br/>
profit could be made thru enough effort - but it WAS possible to make a<br/>
little. At that time - I pointed out that as long as people could sell<br/>
their &#39;loot&#39; - what was the difference? Seemed my logic fell on deaf ears. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Ok, so this sounds kinda weird being posted on this list, and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>

rogue and a level 16 bard (as well as other characters - 10 ogre shaman, 16<br/>
monk, 22 halfling warrior, etc.).  Knowing how often Rogues and Bards are<br/>
linked together in the game (all the rogue/bard only stuffs :), I figured<br/>
you guys might be able to help me out.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Given, rogues already are not the most popular class to play, or even to<br/>

not sure if this has been posted here yet, or if anyone on this list knows<br/>
about it, but I feel I can trust the bard community (being a bard myself, I<br/>
know that newbies to games wouldn&#39;t be playing bards for too many levels,<br/>
and would likely not be on this list anyways - if someone is, I apologize<br/>
for my previous comment =).  I recently found out (and tested myself) that<br/>
the Rogues&#39; pickpocket skill no longer takes loot from a separate unlimited<br/>
coin loot pool.  In fact, it no longer even take coins from a separate loot<br/>
pool all together.  The new way pickpocket works is that it takes 1/2 the<br/>
maximum remaining loot on a monster each time a successful pick occurs.  If<br/>
a rogue was to start picking something that had 2 plat 4 gold 5 silver 3<br/>
copper, or something, it would loot 50% of the plat, then gold, silver and<br/>
copper until there was only 1pp 1gp 1sp 1cp left on the loot of the<br/>
monster.  I spoke with a GM today about this (who luckily played a rogue as<br/>
a secondary character) and he said the reason verant changed this from the<br/>
cycling unlimited pool (would loot high coin, to lowest coin, then back to<br/>
high) was that they thought Rogues were getting to have &quot;too much money&quot; as<br/>
he put it.  This is not the issue here, though, it doesn&#39;t matter how much<br/>
loot we get.  The fact is, though, that when word of this starts to spread<br/>
around, one of two things will happen.  Either everyone will find out about<br/>
it, and rogues will be left on the side of the road until the end of days,<br/>
or, people can start petitioning/posting on official message boards or even<br/>
just doing /feedbacks when they log in to try to get this changed to a<br/>
SEPARATE LIMITED LOOT POOL for the rogues.  If something to this extent<br/>
doesn&#39;t happen, it is fairly likely that all those pieces of armor out<br/>
there that are BRD/ROG may as well just be BRD only.<br/>

players at heart) would appreciate your support on this one.  If you can<br/>
spread the word, maybe we can get this fixed, and have the Rogues be a<br/>
viable class in the game once again.<br/>
