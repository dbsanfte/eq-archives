<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514473029">That does sound fun, my gripe however is that these are Verant run events,<br/>
that will have prizes ranging from Runed Oak Bow (test of flight) to<br/>
Gleaming Bastard Swords / Fang Skull Stiletto (test of steel). I want an<br/>
opportunity to compete for a FSS or even something crappy, but unique that<br/>
came as the result of an event.<br/>
<br/>
I would never bring it up if it were all player run events.<br/>

My guild held a &quot;joust&quot; in the PVP area of Qeynos.  It<br/>
was a friendly event, casters vs melee.  Casters were<br/>
defined as &quot;anyone who can bind&quot;.  Everyone else is a<br/>
melee class.<br/>
<br/>
Simple, but it worked out well.</div>
