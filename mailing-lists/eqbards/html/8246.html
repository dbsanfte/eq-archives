&gt; Wondering where you heard this rumor from?  I read on EQVault that rogues<br/>
&gt; and shamans were soon going to lose the ability to wear rubicite but saw<br/>
&gt; nothing about bards being included.  This may end up being a moot point if<br/>
&gt; the Solusek bard quests give bard unique armor.  I think I would prefer<br/>
&gt; doing the quests, no matter how hard, versus camping for rubicite.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also play a rogue (named Rouge if you ever want to say &quot;hi&quot;) so I keep up with the rogue gossip<br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a summary of the related discussion:<br/>
<br/>
1)  The big mobs in Cazic will soon no longer drop rubicite (see #4).<br/>
2)  Rubicite will possibly become plate classes + rangers only.  This was stated or hinted by<br/>
Brad, I believe, but I could be wrong on the source.<br/>
3)  If you have rubi now, it won&#39;t go away if you are a plate class or a ranger.  If you&#39;re a<br/>
shaman or rogue, I don&#39;t know what happens.<br/>
4)  On Test, the big mobs in Cazic are dropping a new kind of armour called &quot;Assassin Armor&quot; (or<br/>
something close to that) which looks like plate (I believe) and is black.  It is rogue only.<br/>
Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s no drop.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how reliable all this is.  I&#39;d put #1 and #4 in the bank, but #2 and #3 are<br/>
questionable I think.  Any time in the past they&#39;ve taken an item type away from a class, they&#39;ve<br/>
backtracked soon thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that the &quot;replacement rubi&quot; for everyone else besides rogues is the questable armour<br/>
through the Temple of Solusek Ro.  Does this mean rogues don&#39;t have quests?  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
