<div id="ygrps-yiv-181185764">Not to make you mad or anything but this sounds a lot like jealousy. It<br/>
seems your only feel twinking is cheating when some high level&#39;s secondary<br/>
char is twinked with stuff you don&#39;t have. That&#39;s just what it sounds like<br/>
to me anyway.<br/>

like the fact not all songs are avail at every Bard Hall. I have opinions on<br/>
Twinking but they are simply my opinion and even though I feel justified in<br/>
my beliefs I understand other people also have their own beliefs. I can<br/>
easily see how wars based on relegion happen, but as long as we all respect<br/>
everyones right to an opinion then things will be fine.<br/>

(Yes this is twinking) but I do not feel like I have cheated in any way, I<br/>
did not ask for the claw and I have copped plenty for using it. Usually like<br/>
