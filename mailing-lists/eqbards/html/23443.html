p.s. &quot;I was there when...&quot; Sebilis keys were not soul bound.  We all had 2<br/>
keys.  Then one night trying to get to chef/bartender (there were 3 groups<br/>
in the zone total and we were 2 of them - our highest level was maybe 52),<br/>
we got wiped out.  Ok, we start CR.  We get wiped out again.  Ok, we start<br/>
pulling hunter/foragers, nekkid.  After a few hours we had enough keys to go<br/>
back and do CR again.  It was a one of those nights that did not end until<br/>
7am the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
But 2 keys is not really an option for Sleeper&#39;s Tomb - <br/>

On a side note, Ester the Tester says the Sleeper Tomb key is NOT supposed<br/>
to be soulbound.  So how are you supposed to get back inside if you die?<br/>
