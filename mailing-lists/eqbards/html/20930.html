<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679340258">They have a terrible record when it comes to fixing things.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion they have a rushed delivery cycle. In an effort to get changes<br/>
implemented as quickly as possible, they sacrifice QA testing and regression<br/>
testing. They then compound the problem by announcing changes before they<br/>
actually test and make sure the changes were in fact loaded on the live<br/>
server. If they took an additional 30 minutes each patch day and checked to<br/>
make sure that the changes were indeed implemented, they would reduce<br/>
headache significantly.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, things do seem to be getting better and we can&#39;t hold<br/>
past faults against them forever. We also have to realize that they get<br/>
thousands of posts a day from people crying &quot;so and so is broken, FIX IT&quot;.<br/>
First, I don&#39;t believe that everything is broken, it&#39;s just that many people<br/>
don&#39;t konw how it&#39;s supposed to be, or can&#39;t realize that it has to be a<br/>
certain way to prevent exploits or due to the limitations of the game<br/>
engine. Secondly, I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t have time to fix everything, so they<br/>
prioritize.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to see them fix our songs as much as the rest of you, however given<br/>
that the songs in question have long since left my song line up, and I&#39;ve<br/>
learned to circumvent their absence, I can continue to play in the mean<br/>
time. It&#39;s a matter of using what we have. Since I don&#39;t expect to ever see<br/>
these songs fixed, I find other ways to deal with things. If they ever are<br/>
fixed, I&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.<br/>

Ok, if someone wants to reply to him, just point out how many times they<br/>
&quot;fixed&quot; the druid/ranger/ebony bladed sword root with damage spell and how<br/>
they swore up and down that it was fixed each time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The root does damage and breaks the root as soon as it is cast&quot;<br/>
&quot;We fixed it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This went on for 2-3 passes of looking at that spell. They don&#39;t have a good<br/>
track record of properly recognizing the problems we point out as players<br/>
are real.</div>
