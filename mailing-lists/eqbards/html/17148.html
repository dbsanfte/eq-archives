<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342770480">No the few times I got hit were when early in the fight they both missed<br/>
several times in a row and I did not.  I can do max 28 points if both<br/>
weapons hit.  The Sk can do 44 with one hit at max.  His delay is twice<br/>
mine, but I don&#39;t dual wield every round and he double attacks about 80% as<br/>
often as I dual wield.<br/>

I will parse the numbers if I can get them back together.  Will have to find<br/>
another SK though he is 3 levels higher than me now which would skew it too<br/>
much.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;However, if I<br/>
&gt;was within 20% of the other people&#39;s damage output over the course of 50<br/>
&gt;fights, statistics would tell you that during some of those fights I would<br/>
&gt;actually do more damage than them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re attributing the occasional ability to outdamage someone<br/>
with a higher percentage on the randomness of the RNG.  Is that correct?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In no fight did I<br/>
&gt;outdamage them for more than a few mob swings.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems to support your reasoning above, if I understood it correctly.<br/>
It sounds like there were occassions where you outdamaged them, despite<br/>
their higher melee ability.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In many fights I never outdamaged them and took not one attack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this makes sense, since samples over time negate the random factor.  If<br/>
you&#39;re only 80% as effective, over time, you expect the mob to stay on him.<br/>
