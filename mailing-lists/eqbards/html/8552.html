<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489352889">I&#39;m Crier Sharpsong, a 26th half-elf Bard on Fennin Ro.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been having a recurring problem getting my Brass skill up and would<br/>
like to ask people here about it.  I&#39;ve read time and again that I should<br/>
venture to Arena or a PvP area, start Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord and leave<br/>
it running indefinitely to increase my skill.  However, I have not been<br/>
successful in getting that to work.  Initially I went to Arena in Rathe Mts.<br/>
and tried this.  I had read that you only needed to be in the area, not<br/>
actually in the PvP area itself, so I equipped my Minotaur Horn, fired up,<br/>
fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, DDD<br/>
and went to a restaurant for dinner.  Before I left I noticed that the<br/>
&quot;plays horn&quot; graphic wasn&#39;t running, but didn&#39;t think much about it.  Got<br/>
back from dinner to find zero skill increase.  Hmm..  Ok, perhaps I *do*<br/>
have to be in the PvP area, so I tried that.  Same results.  Ok, maybe it&#39;s<br/>
the Minotaur Horn - maybe it&#39;s the problem.  So the next time I was in the<br/>
bank and thought about it, I traded out my Minotaur Horn (tired of the bag<br/>
in my wrist anyhow) for a standard store-bought horn.  Last night I tried<br/>
practicing this song in the PvP area of Freeport and it again wouldn&#39;t<br/>
actually play.  Well now I have gone to Kelethin and bought Screech and am<br/>
completely unable to start the song due to my brass skill.  I tried to start<br/>
Screech (literally) about 300 times last night with and without the horn<br/>
equipped and had *one* success - not too useful.<br/>
<br/>
When there is not a mob within range of my song, what I get is DDD starts, I<br/>
briefly get some orange flares from my hands and then it&#39;s just me standing<br/>
there.  No playing horn graphic, no orange flares, nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone comment on this and/or offer a solution?  I *need* this song, but<br/>
if Verant has changed it so that the only way for me to increase my Brass<br/>
skill is to fight experience-giving mobs with it, I&#39;m screwed.  I *WILL* die<br/>
trying to get DDD and/or Screech fired up against a blue mob.<br/>
