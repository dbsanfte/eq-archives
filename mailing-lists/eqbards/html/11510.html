night for humans without a light source.  I spent half an hour<br/>
lost in Greater Faydark at night with my monk.  The only thing<br/>
you can see are the boundaries between terrain and sky, and<br/>
certain terrain features (white rocks, light brown paths) that<br/>
are barely visible if they&#39;re nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Infravision removes the pitch blackness (so you can see<br/>
terrain better), but highlights heat sources (mobs,<br/>
players) in red.  That makes it better than ultravision for<br/>
picking out a mob in the distance - it&#39;ll be a red<br/>
dot.  Unfortunately, the red seems to be a color shift, not a<br/>
brightness shift.  So black creatures (bears) will still<br/>
appear black.<br/>
<br/>
Ultravision gives everything a blue tint.  It does a better<br/>
job of removing the pitch blackness than infravision, but<br/>
doesn&#39;t highlight mobs or players in any special way.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, if you zone from Misty to Runnyeye with a<br/>
human, it is pitch black.  But if you switch to inventory<br/>
view, the rear-view in the upper right corner will show the<br/>
tunnel behind you with fog lighting (hard to describe).<br/>
