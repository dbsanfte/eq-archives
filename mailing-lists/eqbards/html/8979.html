<br/>
 </span></blockquote>		Sorry if this has already been answered (I&#39;ve been away for<br/>
a bit).  The only way to make the<br/>
		hero spawn that I know of is to kill the skeletons who spawn<br/>
in the set points behind the gear.<br/>
		In particular, there is one spot where he spawns instead of<br/>
a skeleton, and that is the &quot;niche&quot;<br/>
		beside the big gear.   My gut feeling is that people have to<br/>
be killing minotaurs too, but that<br/>
		usually isn&#39;t a problem.<br/>
<br/>
		He doesn&#39;t spawn on a set schedule, that&#39;s for certain.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen times when he doesn&#39;t spawn<br/>
		for days it seems, and other times, he seems to spawn every<br/>
five minutes.  There was a period in<br/>
		beta where I got killed by him 4 times in one 2 hour<br/>
session.  (Different heros).<br/>
<br/>
		Good luck, kill him for me!<br/>
