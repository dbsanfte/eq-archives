<div id="ygrps-yiv-513024860">Consider yourself lucky then if you found 4 giants.  I was in SRo the other<br/>
day helping someone to get the Brazen Brass Kilj plans.  When we arrived,<br/>
there were no giants around plus nobody else camping them.  My group killed<br/>
all kinds of lower level mobs in hopes of getting giants to spawn.  We spent<br/>
over an hour and all we ever got was one giant.  We gave up at that point.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Actually, they nerfed the spawn of these guys.  Last night<br/>
&gt; Karana rebooted and I was the first player in Oasis (the<br/>
&gt; server selection screen said &quot;Karana 0&quot;).  I ran around the<br/>
&gt; zone and was only able to find 4 giants, 2 near the SRo zone.  <br/>
&gt; If you were playing in Oasis back around May/June, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; recall times when there were as many as 8 giants on your<br/>
&gt; screen at once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the patch messages, their rationale for nerfing the spawn<br/>
&gt; was complaints about too many giants/griffins crashing folks<br/>
&gt; killing orcs and gators.  It happened shortly after the<br/>
&gt; fanfare about the first player to reach level 50 though.  So I<br/>
&gt; have to wonder if this wasn&#39;t typical Verant double speak, and<br/>
&gt; their real intent was to give the higher level folks fewer<br/>
&gt; things to hunt to slow down their leveling.<br/>
