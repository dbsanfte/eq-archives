&gt; As far as damage comparisons: I have to completely disagree with the notion <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I ran some extensive tests against the Allizewsaur, with Yak<br/>
and Wak data equivalent to about a half hour of continuous<br/>
combat against it.  The Wak did about 2% more damage over time<br/>
than the Yak if you excluded the procs.  OTOH, even with a 50%<br/>
resist rate, the procs increased the Yak&#39;s damage rate by 15%.<br/>

battle.  When you talk about damage over time, that by<br/>
definition means you&#39;ve taken the duration of the battle out<br/>
of the equation.  The only time it matters is in very short<br/>
battles, ones lasting approx 1-3 combat rounds.  In battles<br/>
that short, the discrete nature of the attacks (damage comes<br/>
in lumps, not continously) favors slow, high damage weapons.<br/>

effects of being low on stamina.  I have not timed attack<br/>
speeds while out of stamina though.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve decided to shitcan my Yaks that I&#39;ve owned and loved for 6+ months. And <br/>
&gt; let me tell you, my cleric spends a LOT less mana on me, and can worry more <br/>
&gt; about keeping the real tanks alive in my party.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect that with the procs, the Yaks will even outdamage<br/>
our planar weapons.  But I completely agree that the procs<br/>
will make you the focus of the mob.  Even with a six-note and<br/>
Waki, I&#39;m often able to pull mobs off my taunting warrior<br/>
friends by sheer virtue of my songs alone.  Still, it might be<br/>
nice to swap in a Yak from time to time for those situations<br/>
where it seems you&#39;re never being attacked.<br/>
