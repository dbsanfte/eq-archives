These two skeletons are level 9-10, however the interesting thing about them<br/>
is that when slain, they have on them a rolled up not. It is a no drop/no<br/>
trade item, but is basically an excerpt of what led to their death. Sort of<br/>
like they are haunting ghosts. I had no idea these were a new addition. I<br/>
fought both tonight at L10-11 with a friend and they fought the same as a<br/>
like-leveled skeleton you might find elsewhere.</div>
