<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598921503">The thing is that people who are really decked out pretty much understand<br/>
the ins and outs of every game. As the&#39;ve got a char that is 40+ maybe a<br/>
little less. By then you basically have a good understanding of every class<br/>
and their limits and so forth.<br/>

&gt;Yeah, the key I think is to strike a balance between items<br/>
&gt;which take some of the edge off starting from scratch, while<br/>
&gt;not giving so much of an advantage that you&#39;re nigh unbeatable<br/>
&gt;for the level.  If you don&#39;t learn the lessons of what the<br/>
&gt;class can and can&#39;t do between levels 1-5, you&#39;re going to<br/>
&gt;learn them between levels 6-10, when you get experience loss<br/>
&gt;for the deaths accompanying those learning experiences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For the twinker this is usually not a problem because the<br/>
&gt;twinking accelerates his level progression more than the<br/>
&gt;experience loss hurts.  For the folks grouped with him though,<br/>
&gt;this can be another matter, as they end up grouped with a<br/>
&gt;player who either does not know how to play the class to best<br/>
&gt;advantage (e.g. bards doing nothing but bellowing during a<br/>
&gt;fight, then healing after), or gets them into situations<br/>
&gt;likely to get them killed because hey if one of them is a<br/>
&gt;close match for me, three of them should be no problem for my<br/>
&gt;group of six.<br/>
