<div id="ygrps-yiv-187251264">IMO, to successfully use this technique on a consistent basis you need to be<br/>
going against blues.  Yellows and reds may resist too much.  Could still<br/>
work but you make take a lot of damage.  Against blues I don&#39;t lose much at<br/>
all with this technique.  Start off with chain, then fear and then start<br/>
whacking them from behind.  I&#39;ve been using Furfils as the 3d song to debuff<br/>
their resist rate.  Bellow might be a good option for you.  Biggest thing to<br/>
be concerned with is that you don&#39;t aggro a second mob while chasing the<br/>
first one.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar note:<br/>
<br/>
Grouped with another 35 bard last night on E&#39;ci in Frontier Mtns.  Lots of<br/>
blues in their for us to fight.  Told her I intended to use the chain/fear<br/>
technique.  She had never heard of the technique before.  She told me not to<br/>
pull any casters.  I told her to continuously pixie strike the caster to<br/>
interrupt their casts.  With both of us doing it we shouldn&#39;t have any<br/>
problems.  She said 1) I weave 4 songs ALL the time, never just one and 2) I<br/>
never fight casters if I can avoid it.  I then asked her if she read this<br/>
list or Concert Hall board.  Said she didn&#39;t have time for message boards<br/>
and hated mailing list spam.  I tried my best to tell her about some of the<br/>
tricks bards could use to defeat mobs.  She said BAH I&#39;m a tank.  I laughed<br/>
to myself.  Pulled a mob and was killing it easily when another mob joined<br/>
in.  She just kept swinging away on first mob so I backed out, charmed the<br/>
second one and had it finish off the first mob.  Then noticed she had quit<br/>
the group.  Was already low in HPs so decided to zone instead of fighting<br/>
the second mob.  Saw her on the other side and tore into her.  She said she<br/>
dropped the group because I backed out of the fight and she was taking all<br/>
the damage.  I asked her if she was aware of how our charm song was used.<br/>
She said BAH our charm song was a wasted song and that she never used it.<br/>
On a whim I asked her what her max charisma was.  She came back with 89.<br/>
She then started to criticize me for trying to use &quot;bard tricks&quot; to defeat<br/>
mobs instead of pure melee.  At that point I decided she was a lost cause<br/>
and I wasn&#39;t gonna try to educate her anymore on how to play a bard.  It<br/>
just strikes me as odd that at this stage of the game you still find players<br/>
who have no freaking idea how to play their class.<br/>

<br/>
Our two main weapons are Selo&#39;s, Chains, and Screech... Our three main<br/>
weapons...<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I expect to get Screech tonite and was hoping to get some<br/>
better understanding of how I might put Screech and Chains to work in the<br/>
wide open expanses of Lake of Ill Omen and The Overthere.  Perhaps some of<br/>
the more experienced bards can shed some light on this?<br/>
