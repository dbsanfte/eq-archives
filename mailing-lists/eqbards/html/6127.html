<div id="ygrps-yiv-7158530">From the discussions that we&#39;ve been having here on this list in the last<br/>
three days or so, it occurred to me that what we need is some sort of cross<br/>
reference of what songs stack with what.  I&#39;m only level 20 so it would be<br/>
difficult for me to produce a lot of the information myself, but I would<br/>
volunteer to assemble the data into a graphical reference or HTML table.  This<br/>
is the sort of thing that I would print out and keep laying around when I<br/>
played, how about you guys &#39;n&#39; gals?<br/>
