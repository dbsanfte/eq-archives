&gt; &gt; Check out this Druid kiting guide.  It tells you exactly how Druids can<br/>

&gt; I still don&#39;t understand why people equate &quot;solo reds&quot; with<br/>
&gt; overpowered.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If one class can easily &quot;solo reds&quot; with relative saftey without taking one<br/>
point of damage, throughout a majority of their levels, then I would<br/>
consider them overpowered.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; It&#39;s true that Druids get their last heal spell at 29 (not 34), but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>after 29<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; they get 4 Regeneration spells that help heal themselves and the party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which are pretty useless in combat situations, for the same<br/>
&gt; reason Hymn becomes less useful in combat the higher level you<br/>
&gt; are.  Yet people see that druids get heal and regeneration<br/>
&gt; spells, and this feeds their belief that druids are<br/>
&gt; overpowered.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At high levels, Druids don&#39;t get Superior Heal like Clerics do.  Instead,<br/>
they become more downtime reduction oriented (Regeneration) like bards.  But<br/>
they still have a 300hp heal when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At the level I&#39;m at (30), the *only* reason I&#39;d prefer a druid<br/>
&gt; in the party is for the transport spells.  Given a choice, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; prefer a mage, wizard, enchanter, or cleric first.  Shaman is<br/>
&gt; a close tossup, but they get a ton of buffs that would make me<br/>
&gt; prefer one over a druid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Druids work great with Bards.  As we know, bards are the monster magnet.  A<br/>
smart druid will put up a damage shield on the bard everytime.  At high<br/>
levels you will want a cleric for primary healing, but a druid can function<br/>
as the backup, plus add many other benefits.<br/>
