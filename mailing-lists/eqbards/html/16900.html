&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;stand still and take your<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; LOL! ...and if I had a dollar for every time I waited<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be healed and died, I could buy Verant;-)<br/>

&gt; Unless the mob was snared or you were SoWed, you would&#39;ve died<br/>
&gt; regardless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unless there&#39;s a speed difference, you can&#39;t run away from<br/>
&gt; mobs.  You can run all you want and the mob will still have no<br/>
&gt; problems hitting you.  If there&#39;s no speed difference, a mob<br/>
&gt; aggros on a caster, and the caster runs around, all he does is<br/>
&gt; make it take *longer* for the others to get it off him than if<br/>
&gt; he&#39;d just stood there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually there is a trick to go just a little faster than Jboots and a<br/>
little slower than SoW when you run.  I won&#39;t go into what it is because<br/>
it&#39;s SO useful for non-SOW classes that I&#39;d hate to see it get &quot;Fixed&quot; by<br/>
Verant.  Basically once I figured out how to do this my SK stopped dying ;)<br/>
<br/>
And... it works INDOORS too ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Even if the mob is snared or you&#39;re SoWed, it&#39;s still<br/>
&gt; generally a poor practice to run since it makes it harder for<br/>
&gt; the tanks to hit it, which increases the time it takes to kill<br/>
&gt; the mob, which lowers the number of mobs you can kill per<br/>
&gt; hour.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true ;)  And I agree.  If something jumps you in a group do NOT run.<br/>
Let the group deal with it.  Worst case, you die.   You probably woulda died<br/>
ANYWAY but at least this way you don&#39;t get the group in an uproar and maybe<br/>
cause a couple extra deaths that wouldn&#39;t have happened if ya&#39;d stayed put.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, in groups I am in, if the caster starts running around when a<br/>
mob jumps them we give them 1 more chance.  If they do it again we disband<br/>
them.<br/>
