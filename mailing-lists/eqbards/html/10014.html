<div id="ygrps-yiv-46515803">Let me throw in this then as some of you know I play a druid mainly and<br/>
I forget that I am talking to the bard list as i subscribe to a few<br/>
list...and yes definately camo is different than bards song.  I<br/>
apologize...i usually like to open my mouth and talk when it concerns<br/>
something I know a little somthing about....some day I will be cured of<br/>
this.... anyway...i can say they definately see through camo...<br/>
I am not saying that everything that comes out of the castle can see<br/>
you...but trust me when I tell you that I have been standing camo&#39;d and<br/>
watching all the mobs in the huge train run by me...right next to the<br/>
lake and I will be the only one standing there and the will sapper will<br/>
change the path from running towards the zone and purposely run out of<br/>
its way to come over and beat on me while all the others have<br/>
completely ignored me.  I have never had anything else see me camo&#39;d<br/>
except the will sapper.  this has also happened to me more than<br/>
once....i dunno maybe its just me or maybe its the difference between<br/>
camo and the invisiblity song......but they have always seen through<br/>
camo....<br/>
