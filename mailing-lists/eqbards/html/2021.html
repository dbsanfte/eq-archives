<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594070192">I went to CB for the first time last night and I was really surprised at how<br/>
easy it was to get both a Shiny Brass Shield, and the Dragoon Dirk.  I<br/>
picked up two shields while killing only 3 trainers, and as everyone knows,<br/>
Dvinn always has the dirk.  In fact, I saw people selling them for 30pp<br/>
which is an amazingly low price for a weapon of that quality.  In fact,<br/>
though my piercing is currently at 0, the weapon is so good, I&#39;m going to<br/>
drop some of my many saved training points in piercing and switch weapons.<br/>
