<div id="ygrps-yiv-932370297">i know this was posted while i was off and i didn&#39;t see it, and probably<br/>
before i posted my reply, but GRRRRRRR Harm you make me mad sometimes.<br/>
Solo, self buffs, no kiting, i mean this too!  and i have accounts of<br/>
warriors, paladins, and rangers doing this.  stop being so stubborn!<br/>
<br/>
HARRRRRRRRMMMM!<br/>
HARRRRRRRRMMMM!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   When I mean solo, I mean no shields, no buffs other than the ones<br/>
&gt;   they possess.  Completely solo, no outside help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   When you factor that in those people have no chance against npcs<br/>
&gt;   of that nature.  If you reso,sow,symbol a tank you&#39;ve just given <br/>
&gt;   them 50% more hp than they would normal have.  I&#39;ve seen warriors<br/>
&gt;   and paladins with full cleric/shaman buffs beat a sand/hill giant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   But a pure solo attempt on a hill giant from a warrior means base<br/>
&gt;   hp, base stats, base ac.  For a paladin it means valor, weak symbol,<br/>
&gt;   guard and use of LoH.  For a ranger it means skin like <br/>
&gt; steel, wolfform,<br/>
&gt;   agi, str, thorns.  A monk??? hahahahaha, sorry.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Here&#39;s a little tidbit of info, L50 monk = 1200 hp.  nuff said.<br/>
