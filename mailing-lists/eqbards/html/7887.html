and to a lesser extent the SBH are infamous for being bad in<br/>
this regard.  My guess is because they&#39;re in relatively safe<br/>
areas which are frequently camped so as to pose little risk to<br/>
the solo kill stealer.  If you get to some of the more<br/>
dangerous/obscure locales, it becomes less of a problem.<br/>
<br/>
We finally got a fourth Ghoulbane last night for the fourth<br/>
paladin in our guild.  All told we spent probably 40 hours<br/>
camping the lord spot over the last two months (for those who<br/>
don&#39;t know where this is, it&#39;s deep in a dungeon and requires<br/>
a high 20s to low 30s group to get to and hold).  We got four<br/>
lords with swords, and I&#39;d estimate 15 lords with bracers<br/>
(yes, we have silver plated bracers coming out our ears).  In<br/>
all that time, we only had one problem with a kill stealer,<br/>
and he was already known server-wide as a kill stealer (and<br/>
oddly enough has disappeared ever since school started).  <br/>
Whenever we found the spot camped, we were friendly with the<br/>
campers and ask them to give us a tell when they were done.  <br/>
They did so in all cases, and a couple of them that didn&#39;t<br/>
have paladins in their groups let us take over right then and<br/>
there.  When people came upon us while camping, they left us<br/>
alone, and we told them when we were done (and one guy got<br/>
Ghoulbane 30 seconds after we left).<br/>
<br/>
Although I still feel kill stealing is a huge problem in the<br/>
game, it definitely does not extend to all items and all<br/>
locales.<br/>
