<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944513396">I&#39;m starting to notice this more and more.  You can pretty much tell when<br/>
everyone in your group is attacking the same mob by their orientation<br/>
towards the mob.  A lot of the time, I get the &quot;head nods&quot; message for all<br/>
the mobs but the extra mobs that should be asleep keep attacking.  Very<br/>
disappointing.<br/>

&gt; TRYING to use Lullaby in Cazic-Thule last night and I&#39;d get a &quot;nods&quot;<br/>
&gt; message<br/>
&gt; for EVERY mob and then get hit by two or three.  This is really<br/>
&gt; aggravating.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s gotten so my groups are saying &quot;That song&#39;s not useful, quit using<br/>
&gt; it.&quot;<br/>
