It can be done.  The white scale is the sticking point as so many know ;p.<br/>
<br/>
Spawning him is quite straightforward.  The Undead Bard spawns in Trakanon&#39;s<br/>
lair after Trak is killed.  I have heard varying reports on when, it&#39;s between<br/>
6 and 72 at the most, some say 18 +- 4.<br/>
<br/>
Hand the Undead Bard the lute body; he hands it back unchanged, then aggros and<br/>
must be killed.  Once he dies, Trakanon spawns.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget to prepare with coffin(s) in case you or others get shroomed.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t, which was nice :).<br/>
<br/>
I read The Concert Hall&#39;s guide, and also the one at EQDiva.<br/>
<br/>
Luck!<br/>

&gt; Where can I find the info on how to spawn the &quot;bard trakanon&quot;?  Might be<br/>
&gt; time for me to finish this off too.<br/>
