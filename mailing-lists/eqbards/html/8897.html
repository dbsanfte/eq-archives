room, as do goblin shaman at random locations.  I was in a<br/>
group of 6 without nukers (1 cleric, 5 tanks, level 29-37) and<br/>
we had the run of the place until we got a pull with two<br/>
shamen.  Basically we couldn&#39;t kill anything, and kept<br/>
fighting and fighting until the room started to spawn, and had<br/>
to run with 6 goblins (two of whom we&#39;d damaged enough to kill<br/>
at least 5 times over) chasing us.  So bring a nuker with you<br/>
if you plan to camp it.<br/>
<br/>
We never did find that second shaman.  Must&#39;ve been healing<br/>
through the walls...<br/>
