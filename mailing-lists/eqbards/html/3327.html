<div id="ygrps-yiv-803543212">Hang out just outside Crushbone, they usually will loot Dvinn, run outside<br/>
and auction it, I have seen them sell for 10 pp.  You might get lucky.  The<br/>
dragoon&#39;s dirk is better than almost any combine/well balanced weapon.  I<br/>
would not waste any money on the store bought variety, Demon claws are nice,<br/>
but very expensive, and so is the PGT, if you don&#39;t need magical weapons<br/>
yet, the Dwarven axe that comes off Lord Darvish is great, there are two<br/>
varieties, 1hs, and 2hs, bards can only use the 1h version.  The 2h version<br/>
sells for some serious plat tho, so it&#39;s good to get to sell.  The one hand<br/>
version does dmg 6, delay 26, so it&#39;s delay is almost as good as Dirk, and<br/>
it does same damage, so except for the non magical ability it&#39;s a really<br/>
good weapon.  In one hit the Mino axe does more damage, over the length of a<br/>
fight, you will do 20PTS+ more damage than the mino because you swung almost<br/>
30% faster.  It makes a big difference, it also maxes your 1hs skill faster,<br/>
between the dirk and axe, I max both my skills within about 20 minutes of<br/>
leveling.<br/>

&gt; I have just reached Level 9, and am currently considering going<br/>
&gt; beyond the safety of East Commonlands. (Prexus Server)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am still using my trusty Scimitar, and I have tried a Mino Axe, but<br/>
&gt; have found that while the large damage is nice, it is kinda slow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have enough money to get a Combine Scimitar, but seeing as it is<br/>
&gt; just a magic upgrade (and one speed) to the Scimitar, I have held<br/>
&gt; off.  I have seen the Swashbuckler with his 200pp+ weapons, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; trying to decide if it is worth saving money for those Well-Balanced<br/>
&gt; weapons or a Demon&#39;s Claw / Dragoon&#39;s Dirk if I come across them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How resaleable are the well balanced weapons?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And where should I hang around to hear auctions on Dragoon&#39;s Dirk? <br/>
&gt; Greater Faydark near Crushbone?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks guys.<br/>
