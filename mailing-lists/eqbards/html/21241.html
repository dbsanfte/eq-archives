<div id="ygrps-yiv-139494022">Ooh, must have missed that one.  I was hoping we would have something<br/>
available at a lower level than that though.  I&#39;m nowhere near able to take<br/>
on Dragons, and likely never will be.  My advancement has slowed to a crawl.<br/>
I thought it was going to be closer to the burning rapier in difficulty.<br/>

Wasn&#39;t there a quote from Abashi recently about the quests for the <br/>
other classes equivelant to the Fiery Avenger being almost completed?<br/>
<br/>
Uhmm... that sentence sucks, but I can&#39;t figure out how to make it <br/>
more succinct. :)  Too tired today. <br/>
