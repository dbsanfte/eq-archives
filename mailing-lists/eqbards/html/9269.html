    Test Server Update  10/27/99 5:30 pm<br/>
    <br/>
    The following changes have been updated on the Test server:<br/>
    <br/>
    *Zone Enhancements*<br/>
    <br/>
    Kedge Keep has been fully revamped with new items, treasure and creatures.<br/>
    <br/>
    *Class Enhancements*<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Warrior - % increase on critical hits<br/>
    Rogue - +8 poison resistance<br/>
    Paladin - +8 disease resistance<br/>
    Ranger - +4 Fire +4 Cold resistance<br/>
    ShadowKnight - +4 Poison +4 Disease resistance<br/>
    Monk - +8 Fire resistance<br/>
    <br/>
    Shadowknights may now use the following spells:<br/>
    <br/>
    - LifeTap may now be cast at level 9.<br/>
    <br/>
    - LifeSpike may now be cast at level 15.<br/>
    <br/>
    - LifeDraw may now be cast at level 30. The LifeTap, LifeSpike, and LifeDraw <br/>
    spell scrolls may be purchased from any ShadowKnight spell vendor. To make <br/>
    room for these new spells, the following spells are no longer available for <br/>
    ShadowKnights:<br/>
    <br/>
    - Reclaim Energy<br/>
    <br/>
    - Mend Bones<br/>
    <br/>
    - Voice Graft<br/>
    <br/>
    *Spell Enhancements*<br/>
    <br/>
    - Invoke Fear (Necromancer, Enchanter, SK, and Cleric) has both had it&#39;s <br/>
    casting time and mana cost reduced.<br/>
    <br/>
    - Charm spells now message the message when they break (Enchanter, Bard, <br/>
    Necromancer, Druid)<br/>
    <br/>
    - Magician pets now have new spells.<br/>
    <br/>
    - Ensnare (Druid) has had it&#39;s casting time reduced.<br/>
    <br/>
    - High level Necromancer and Magician pets now look different.<br/>
    <br/>
    - Illusions (Enchanter) have had their duration increased.<br/>
    <br/>
    - Tishan and Markar&#39;s Clash spells (Wizard) have had their casting times <br/>
    reduced.<br/>
    <br/>
    - Some in-game Bardic instruments have had their stats increased to <br/>
    appropriate levels. Items effected are the Minotaur horn, Small Brass <br/>
    Trumpet, and the Drum. Some non-magic instruments have been made magic. <br/>
    These are the Mistmoore Battle Drums, the Lute of the Gypsy Princess and <br/>
    Kelin&#39;s Practice Lute.<br/>
    <br/>
    - Bards with magic gloves and magic instruments may now punch creatures that <br/>
    require magic to damage.<br/>
    <br/>
    - The EverQuest Team<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &lt;&lt;my comments:<br/>
    This sounds pretty neat - I wonder if &#39;stats increased&#39; means 5% added to stringed or just +5 sv magic or something.<br/>
    Also very nice that we can punch magical creatures...<br/>
    All in all a good update for bards. :)<br/>
    Anyone know what Small Brass Trumpet  and Kelin&#39;s Practice Lute are? I&#39;ve never heard of these. And I suppose &#39;Drum&#39; is the drum you buy in the store?<br/>
