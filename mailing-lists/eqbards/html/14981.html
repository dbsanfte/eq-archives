&gt; I can&#39;t remember where I read it at (EQVault or Casters Realm), but a couple<br/>
&gt; of weeks ago I saw a message from Brad McQuaid stating that one of the short<br/>
&gt; range projects Verant was working on was fixing all the pathing problems in<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore.  Hopefully we will soon see a correction to a bug that has been<br/>
&gt; in the game since release.<br/>

away when fleeing from you.  This is a big problem with the<br/>
Hill Giants in Rathe.  None of the Mistmoore pathing problems<br/>
I know of are caused by this.<br/>
<br/>
In MM, the main problem is that mobs don&#39;t take a straight<br/>
line route to get to you.  Anything you pull from or in front<br/>
of the ballroom runs through the ballroom, out the back,<br/>
through the negotiator room, and then towards you.  On the<br/>
way, it picks up all the mobs in the ballroom, the negotiator<br/>
room, and the gargoyles in between.  (There are other pathing<br/>
problems, but this is the big one.  Second would have to be<br/>
that annoying mob which immediately runs for the castle when<br/>
it sees you - doesn&#39;t even bother to attack.)<br/>
