&gt; &gt; I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of NOWHERE -<br/>
&gt; why<br/>
&gt; &gt; would this act like such a magnet?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; even worse, i was down in runnyeye over the weekend standing around<br/>
&gt; in a room waiting for some tougher monsters to spawn. I wasn&#39;t singing any<br/>
&gt; songs, and goblins that weren&#39;t in the same room would detect me and i&#39;d<br/>
&gt; hear the &quot;Half-elves like you have no place in our room&quot;. about 3 or 4<br/>
&gt; minutes later a horde of about 8 goblins would burst into the room and go<br/>
&gt; ape-shit on me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s pretty unfair that goblins that couldn&#39;t see me would come after me<br/>
&gt; when i wasn&#39;t doing anything to them, especially since it wasn&#39;t happening<br/>
&gt; to anyone else in the room.<br/>
