<div id="ygrps-yiv-331885898">Guys - I think you are inadvertantly arguing the same thing.  On the one<br/>
hand - less &quot;new&quot; stuff has been added for 46-.  Overcrowding issues aside;<br/>
for the majority of us, there is enough &quot;stuff&quot; for 46- to do.  Overcrowding<br/>
issues aside - there needs to be more &quot;stuff&quot; for 46+ to do.  Maybe not<br/>
everyone will agree with me on this - but I strongly believe it to be true.<br/>
<br/>
    Perhaps if you play the game A LOT (more than I do) and are doing a<br/>
second character - you&#39;d like to see new 46- (the been there done that<br/>
syndrome) - but in this case - for all practicle you&#39;re still a 46+ - cause<br/>
you&#39;ve built a character up.<br/>
<br/>
    Now - no one can argue that the servers aren&#39;t overcrowded.  The<br/>
crowding problem affects people of ALL levels.  For us 46- this is a<br/>
problem.  For the 46+ it&#39;s a problem.  I supposed the only positive might be<br/>
people starting new characters in zones like West and East Commons and<br/>
probably don&#39;t have to worry about getting attacked by Griffens and Giants<br/>
like I did when I started my character; but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the<br/>
spots they want to hunt are overcrowded as well.<br/>
<br/>
    I think it&#39;s kind of silly for people who think &quot;the crowding issue is<br/>
worse for my level than others&quot;.  It reminds me of stupid arguments between<br/>
musicians who claim their intsrument is harder to play.  To play well - they<br/>
all are hard!<br/>
<br/>
    There&#39;s no easy solution to this.  I heard someone propose putting caps<br/>
on the server when 1500+ come on.  I personally would be damn pissed if I<br/>
wanted to play and couldn&#39;t get in - regardless of how crowded it is.  This<br/>
is probably not an acceptable solution.<br/>
<br/>
    I hear they are splitting Fennin Ro up.  Good for Fennin - but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t help me.  I can see that opening a can of worms.  If they do that to<br/>
my server - I&#39;d hate to find out a lot of my good friends end up on another<br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
    But short of adding a whole slew of new zones (ideally the best<br/>
solution) which is impracticle to expect; I really don&#39;t see an &quot;ideal&quot;<br/>
solution...<br/>
<br/>
    Anyway - despite my own two-cents - this thread probably should be<br/>
Kabong&#39;d (not much else I can do while waiting for a CAB for a large VB<br/>
project to be built)...</div>
