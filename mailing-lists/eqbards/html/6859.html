<div id="ygrps-yiv-419384042">For bards who hunt in South Karana, is it best to get bound in the Arena or<br/>
in Qeynos?  The Arena may be quicker in terms of getting back to your corpse<br/>
but you won&#39;t have a flute to sing invis song (to avoid getting attacked as<br/>
you run back to your corpse).  Is this something I should be concerned with<br/>
or will the wandering mobs in SK leave me alone?<br/>

&gt; Since on my server (Karana) the Treehouse is majorly camped, but there are<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; many wandering Avaiks in the area between the Treehouse and Paw.  When I <br/>
&gt; used to slow there I would just zoom around with Selo&#39;s till I found one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was still quicker (and more fun) then fighting over the static spawn<br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; the Treehouse :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Myself and another bard on my server, seem to be doing well in South<br/>
&gt; Karana<br/>
&gt; &gt;fighting Aviaks in and around the Aviak City... We can solo Darters and<br/>
&gt; &gt;Rooks, and in groups we can take harriers and Avocets, these things are <br/>
&gt; &gt;rich<br/>
&gt; &gt;also.  I went from just hitting 21 to well into 23 so far in a couple of<br/>
&gt; &gt;days.<br/>
