<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360429898">I regularly use Charm and chain so that my lil pet doesnt have to run so <br/>
much. Of course I go for the obviously stronger mob (in my case ive been <br/>
fighting aviaks for the last 10 level, so  i got avo&#39;s or harriers.).<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today i took 3 avocets and 2 rooks and had a blast takin them all <br/>
down, only took bout 10 minutes too.<br/>
As for charm and fear I could see how that would work good, you just have to <br/>
be a lil cose :)<br/>
