<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307329128">I honestly don&#39;t know why this bothers ppl to this extent. When you get lvl <br/>
50 and you get SO sick and tired of seeing the insides of Guk and Sol B, you <br/>
can&#39;t find a group, nothing is going on, and you got all this extra loot <br/>
sitting around not being used - why not use it? Trust me when you get 50th <br/>
you will feel the same way. The ONLY lvl 50 people I know that haven&#39;t <br/>
twinked a character were unable to because they are on other servers. You <br/>
get sick of being a newbie, and twinking makes it much easier to get passed <br/>
this very boring phase of a newbie&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
When I first got EQ I had a blast being a newbie, learning the ropes, <br/>
running from little goblins and orcs. Now - I would skip directly to lvl 14 <br/>
(at least) if I could. I&#39;ve been a newbie so many times (many times forced <br/>
by character deletions during beta and then commercial release) it just does <br/>
NOT appeal to me anymore in the slightest.<br/>
<br/>
Full quest armor on a twink? Be happy they got it and probably won&#39;t be <br/>
going after that item anymore should you also happen to be interested in the <br/>
same quest.<br/>
<br/>
I also have no problems grouping with twinked people because I know they <br/>
have nice stuff that helps give them an edge. =) This translates directly to <br/>
how well your party can do. Currently I&#39;m wearing enough WIS crap on my <br/>
druid to get at least 2 extra bubbles of mana. This is a huge difference <br/>
than what I would have if untwinked, and I feel more comfortable with it.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY times I have had any problem whatsoever with a twink was when I was <br/>
sitting in Oasis, and I saw an Ogre stroll up to me with this neat lookin <br/>
sword (looked like a Wakizashi). I noticed he was 14th level so I inspected <br/>
him....WTF?!?! A Bladestorm!??!?!?!?!?! This is where I draw the line...I <br/>
mean come on - weapons that are dropped from a god? I am so glad they <br/>
implemented the level limit. My first time in Fear was just after the level <br/>
cap patch. I was with Fires of Heaven (a guild with a notorious reputation <br/>
on my server), and a mob dropped some Ranger only no drop boots. Hmmm no <br/>
Ranger around...so the guy leading the hunt logged in his newbie-gimp ranger <br/>
(sub-20th level I believe) and looted the boots. He had this ranger camped <br/>
there before the level limits were imposed. He did not know that Caphys, <br/>
Veeshan&#39;s lead GM was watching us invisible until Caphys said to remove all <br/>
low level characters from the zone. Of course this guy was not really <br/>
reprimanded in any way because FoH and the GMs on my server are in the sack, <br/>
but that&#39;s a whole different story - I digress.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand people being jealous of items other characters twinks have. <br/>
Hell, my in-game spouse has a 17th level rogue with a sash, silver <br/>
legplates, BONE RAZOR, and other awesome stuff.. I drool and I give her hell <br/>
for it all the time, but it&#39;s all in fun. =) Just wait til you are 50th and <br/>
start feeling that eq boredom  creep in and you pain for something new to <br/>
do. I&#39;m sure not everyone will do it, but the majority will either twink a <br/>
new char or quit EQ.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>
&gt;and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;seen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk up to 23rd and an<br/>
&gt;Enchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing that the best class in<br/>
&gt;the game was bard..  but I digress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent, dual Ykeshas, Flowing <br/>
&gt;Black<br/>
&gt;Silk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked out like a level 50<br/>
&gt;that hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago I saw a level 15 in<br/>
&gt;full Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other goodies as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly* discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor that I have and I <br/>
&gt;*still*<br/>
&gt;lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on the sands of Oasis,<br/>
&gt;being *less* complete than a guy that started his bard last weekend.  Not<br/>
&gt;only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having 38 &#39;played&#39; days and not<br/>
&gt;being level 50.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When there ceases to be any way for players&#39; characters to differentiate<br/>
&gt;themselves from one another other based upon level (i.e. time and effort<br/>
&gt;expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want, when people look at <br/>
&gt;me,<br/>
&gt;for them to know that I braved death and died many times to achieve the<br/>
&gt;armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to assume that I bought it <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>
&gt;&quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>
&gt;different story.  The bard that I saw in Oasis would have been in steel<br/>
&gt;probably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based upon<br/>
&gt;my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know* that I had earned the<br/>
&gt;pieces for myself.  They would know that I had pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>
&gt;Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>
&gt;for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not being NO DROP has reduced <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes me<br/>
&gt;feel this way.<br/>
