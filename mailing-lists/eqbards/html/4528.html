<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-859864362">Its ridiculous to even talk about us needing more slots when almost all the<br/>
mage clases receive 10 to 20 new spells every 4 levels. It does stink that<br/>
we take so long to mem songs, especially the new ones. But I wonder if its<br/>
intelligence based, level based, or usage based. If we sit and mem a song<br/>
over and over does the time improve? Thats the way many games used to work.<br/>
I am also ticked that when Verant patched last week to &#39;fix&#39; the missed<br/>
notes on higher level songs, I now miss notes on all my songs even Selo and<br/>
Hymn. I never use to miss notes on Chain till this patch, anyone else having<br/>
a problem twisting because of this? It throws my whol rhythm if I miss a<br/>
note and then have to re-sing the song.<br/>
<br/>
Another feature I would like to see is a pop-up to one side that has all the<br/>
pet commands. Anytime you have a pet to control either you have this popup<br/>
or a button like social that lists all the pet commands.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does anyone think that bards should not be limited to<br/>
&gt; memorizing only eight songs at a time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to see 8 more bubbles on the right side of the screen opposite the<br/>
8 we all have now. Verant could even make it so that it&#39;s a level thing that<br/>
you couldn&#39;t use the other 8 spots until say level such and such (15+) like<br/>
dual wield. Makes sense. You get more experienced and are able to remember<br/>
more songs. Especially if you&#39;ve been playing the first 8 songs for 15+<br/>
levels of your life.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem <br/>
&gt; with this. Many of their spells at higher levels are just<br/>
&gt; improved versions of spells they had at lower levels.<br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t really have to worry about memorizing their low<br/>
&gt; level spells once they reach a certain point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d disagree here. Spellcasting classes use spells all of their lives and<br/>
normally have much higher INT/WIS stats than we as Bards do. Thus it would<br/>
make more sense for them to be able to expand their # of memorized spells<br/>
than not.<br/>
