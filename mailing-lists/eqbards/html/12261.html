&gt; On a second but maybe related note, I believe the random number genrator<br/>
&gt; may be flawed in the game.  I see too many long runs of unlikly events<br/>
&gt; (both good and bad).  This would be far from unheard of, as random<br/>
&gt; number generators are eseentially impossible to code.  (People just<br/>
&gt; write code that approximates random number generartion).  I did a study<br/>
&gt; of the random number generator built into the 8088 (basically the<br/>
&gt; original IBM PC) processor.  (I used a few different languages to try to<br/>
&gt; eliminate any effect they had on it).  I basically graphed a &quot;random&quot; x<br/>
&gt; and y cooordinate, drawing a line from point 1 to 2 to 3, etc...  The<br/>
&gt; plots always followed similar patterns... Weird, eh?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really good random number generators are notoriously difficult<br/>
to write.  However, you have to keep in mind that unless<br/>
they&#39;re saving seeds for every event sequence (e.g. whether<br/>
your weapon procs, which mob spawns at a site), your<br/>
&quot;sequence&quot; of random number events is not a really a sequence.  <br/>
It&#39;s pieces of the actual sequence, the other random numbers<br/>
having gone to determining if the mob hit your tank, whether<br/>
your caster friend&#39;s spell fizzled, whether the guy meditating<br/>
at the other end of the zone &quot;passed&quot; his skill check, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The order of these events are pretty much random, depending on<br/>
player input, Internet lag, etc.  So even if the random<br/>
numbers are only quasi-random, *which* quasi-random number you<br/>
get *is* random.  So I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to blame the RNG<br/>
just because you get a few unusual strings of sequences.<br/>
