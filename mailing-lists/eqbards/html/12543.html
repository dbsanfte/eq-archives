<div id="ygrps-yiv-986330629">Just wondering if I could have done this better....<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night in Najena, while waiting for my party<br/>
to come back (long story, we died and I was bound<br/>
close.) I wanted to stop by and see if Najena was<br/>
camped. Being the nutcase that I am, I hit lullaby,<br/>
(my magic AE door opener.) and find a full spawn.<br/>
Well, I could fight, or I could die, so I decided to<br/>
play. I charm magician #1 and sicc her on Najena,<br/>
while I twist guardian. All the mobs aggro on her<br/>
(including her own pet) she dies quick. One pulse of<br/>
charm and the pet suicides. Charm mage #2, sicc her on<br/>
Najena too. She dies, of course, and I charm the pet. <br/>
<br/>
Najena was tougher. I was going to fear/chain her, but<br/>
it didn&#39;t work too well. I ended up meleeing her,<br/>
while pixie&#39;ing like mad. She got 2 spells off. <br/>
<br/>
All said and done, I nearly died. I was somewhere<br/>
around 1 bubble after all this fun, and not willing to<br/>
chance it again. (Damn froglok ghoul almost killed me<br/>
on the way out.) Any advice on how to do this better<br/>
next time?<br/>
