<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010388330">YES!,  It is very annoying.  I like to help out people within the <br/>
     confines of the game (locate body ect.) but Begging for money is a <br/>
     different case altogether.  I always ignore begging but it makes me <br/>
     feel guilty anyway. <br/>

One thing that I find, that I assume is related to twinking,  is low level <br/>
characters, begging for money or Items.  Probably because their previous <br/>
character was twinked by some high level char and they didn&#39;t have to work <br/>
hard to get up in the world.  And then they either moved servers, or deleted <br/>
their previous char and no one has come and thrown 100plat their way.<br/>
anyone else notice this begging?<br/>
