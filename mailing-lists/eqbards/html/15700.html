<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901078291">Hmm...tough call.  You will need to do the install again to get everything in your registry (copying the whole directory might not work because of this), so I&#39;d say just go with patching it again.  Its the safest option ya have.  If ya have a bad connection to the internet, I&#39;d say just let it run over the night...there aren&#39;t too many things that need to be patched, I&#39;d say no more than 100mb worth of stuff.  On a 56k connection, this would take about a nights worth of downloading.<br/>
Heh, good luck man, hope it works out<br/>

  TOtally non bardish, but you people seem to know everything.  I got a<br/>
  new computer (woohoo!)  What is the best way to move EQ over to it?  I<br/>
  assume I will have to reinstall and wait about 10 hours getting<br/>
  patched...  Are there any files I should copy over?<br/>
