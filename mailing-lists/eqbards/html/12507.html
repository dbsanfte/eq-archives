<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-507121079">Its just a bug with the way quests work.  If you don&#39;t give the items in<br/>
the &quot;correct&quot; order, you see odd messages like that.  (Note: You&#39;ll<br/>
still get your prize, but you&#39;ll also get odd messages)<br/>
<br/>
By correct I think its just whatever order Verant has in their database.<br/>

&gt; I completed the lambent breastplate quest the other day.  When I gave the<br/>
&gt; quest components to Cyrissia (sp?), I got the breastplate, faction change<br/>
&gt; messages, experience gain message,  etc.  I then noticed on the next line in<br/>
&gt; the text window a message from Cyrissia saying &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting<br/>
&gt; something?&quot;.  None of the words were bracketed as a key word/phrase.  I<br/>
&gt; tried replying with variations of &quot;What am I forgetting?&quot; but got no further<br/>
&gt; response from her.  Was wondering if this was just a bug or if there might<br/>
&gt; possibly something else I could have given her?<br/>
