<div id="ygrps-yiv-117712477">I&#39;d do two things:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Find another guild<br/>
2)  Let EVERY bard on the server know about your guild&#39;s attitude.  Not too<br/>
hard to do, just start spreading the word.  Bards talk (probably more than<br/>
any other class) to each other.  Pretty soon your guild will find that they<br/>
cannot do dragons or just about anything else because they&#39;ll never have<br/>
bards along to help.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are with you.  That has to be the lamest thing I&#39;ve ever<br/>
heard... well... asside from how those guides were treated.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I think about the fact that I retired from the guide program,<br/>
I smile... this is one of those times.<br/>
<br/>
PS:  If any of you know guides or know people thinking of being a guide.<br/>
Please advise them to either Quit now, or not apply.  Nobody deserves to be<br/>
treated the way Verant treats their guides.  (Trust me, I should know.  I<br/>
was in the program for over 10 months).<br/>
<br/>

&gt; dunno, get all the bards together and boycott the guild<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t let them have any help from you at all<br/>
&gt; after a couple of miserable fights, they might change their mind<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; just a though, I&#39;m the only Primary Character Bard in my guild, so I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how this will work<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; tonight i found out that no longer will bards in our guild be allowed on<br/>
&gt; &gt; lotto for haste items, ever. (unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 cloak of flames dropped off nagafen last time (i wasn&#39;t there or i<br/>
&gt; &gt; would&#39;ve known about this sooner) and bards were excluded in the lotto.<br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; more runed bolster belts will be going to bards either.  (fbss only<br/>
likely<br/>
&gt; &gt; one now, and only then if no other guild members that need it are in<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; &gt; according to guild rules)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>
&gt; &gt; different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the leaders of the<br/>
&gt; guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they don&#39;t need a<br/>
haste<br/>
&gt; &gt; item. (even tho they stack)  being a huge guild, the leaders get whines<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; rants all the time, so our chances of convincing them otherwise is very<br/>
&gt; &gt; slim.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; any ideas?<br/>
