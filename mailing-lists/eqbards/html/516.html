<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957429303">For most skills you will start with the number of points equal to your<br/>
level that you first trained in it. I assume that you put your first point<br/>
in Stringed when it became available at level 8. Exceptions to this that I<br/>
know of are the languages, which seem to always start at 1 regardless of<br/>
level, and Dual Wield, which appears to start at double your level.<br/>

A general question about expending practice points:<br/>
<br/>
When I got to 8th level I expended one practice point to train in String.<br/>
The first time I sang a song that used a stringed instrument, my skill<br/>
raised one point to 9.  That indicates that expending the initial practice<br/>
point to get the String skill gave me a skill level of 8.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, when I first started my character I expended one practice<br/>
point in Sense Heading.  The next time I went up a level in Sense Heading,<br/>
my skill level was only 2.  That indicated one practice point spent and one<br/>
skill level gained.<br/>
<br/>
So, does expending a practice point give you a random amount of skill levels<br/>
based on your INT and/or WIS score or does it only give you one skill level<br/>
per practice point?  If the second case is true, how do you account for me<br/>
getting 8 skill points in String while only expending 1 practice point?<br/>
<br/>
Reason for asking:  I am about to embark on a secondary career as the<br/>
Kelethin brewmaster for E&#39;ci.  I haven&#39;t expended any practice points in<br/>
brewing yet.  I want to get my skill up to 10 before I start the learning<br/>
process.  Just need to know if I only need to put a couple of practice<br/>
points in it or will I need to expend 10 practice points.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
