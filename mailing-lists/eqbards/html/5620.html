<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; These leads into another question, John stated that sometimes <br/>
&gt; the hag casts<br/>
&gt; See Invisibility on the mobs and thats why they still attack <br/>
&gt; you when you<br/>
&gt; sing the song.  What about other types of mobs?  Do any <br/>
&gt; creatures out there<br/>
&gt; have the innate ability to See Invisibility or do they have <br/>
&gt; to also cast the<br/>
&gt; See Invisibility spell?<br/>
