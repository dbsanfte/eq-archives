<b>Subject:</b> Selo&#39;s and root <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-558664932">Well I haven&#39;t been rooted in a long time so I can&#39;t confirm it but on<br/>
Sunday night a guild mate of mine reported that he broke out of a root using<br/>
Selos.  He was surprised that it actually worked because he was under the<br/>
impression that it wouldn&#39;t.  He tried it anyway and was able to escape.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still skeptical until I do it myself.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Although Selo&#39;s does not break root anymore I thought<br/>
&gt; we had determined that it would on the next pulse if<br/>
&gt; you were playing it before being rooted.  Well, last<br/>
&gt; night in Mistmoore this did not appear to be the case.<br/>
&gt;  I was running around when I was rooted by<br/>
&gt; something--maybe dark offerer or whatever.  Anyway<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s was on and did NOT break root.  It is possible<br/>
&gt; that I got rooted and stunned which killed my song<br/>
&gt; before the next pulse.  I got out of the root and was<br/>
&gt; blasted about 2 jumps from the zone. Arghhh.  Anyway,<br/>
&gt; can anyone verify the root thing?  I&#39;ll try to<br/>
&gt; experiment with a rooter tonight.<br/>
