You have to make a decision: Does this ruin the experience so much for you<br/>
that you aren&#39;t having fun anymore. OR are you going to log on again because<br/>
it doesn&#39;t make that big a diference.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I can justify it so I Don&#39;t Care.<br/>
<br/>
For you, you have to make your own decision.<br/>
<br/>
The ultimate way to protest ANYTHING is the one we all share -- vote with<br/>
your money.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Think for a moment.  If CT *really* had a death touch, what<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; would he do the moment he discovered mortals were messing<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; around in his realm?  DT all of them.  Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; do if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; game, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; super-powers.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Unless you lack the imagination to do anything better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My point was, if you were playing Cazic and had this power,<br/>
&gt;would you ever die?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If not, and a mob with this power can be killed, then what&#39;s<br/>
&gt;the point of giving him this power?  All it&#39;s done is made him<br/>
&gt;more difficult to kill.  Well, there are lots of ways to make<br/>
&gt;mobs more difficult to kill without resorting to random<br/>
&gt;insta-death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You folks are trying to justify the DT saying that he&#39;s a god<br/>
&gt;and should have it.  That&#39;s fine and good, but if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;use it like a being of super-intelligence, then I don&#39;t see it<br/>
&gt;being much different than death by router crash - i.e. it gets<br/>
&gt;applied more or less randomly and without reason.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;justify either being necessary for the game IMHO.<br/>
