<div id="ygrps-yiv-725254722">Its actually not that I die that often.  But whenever someone other than a<br/>
caster dies in our group we are basically done for the evening while the<br/>
others recover their bodies and camp for the night.  How come you always die<br/>
5 minutes before you want to go to bed and 40 minutes from your bind point<br/>
minimum on the night before a patch that might wipe out corpses all over?<br/>
Hence my song Loading, Please Wait which EQStratics actually published.  I<br/>
was actually surprised.<br/>

&gt; Definitely Agreed!  Still I can&#39;t figure out why people think running<br/>
naked<br/>
&gt; accross the world to you body is more fun than regaining exp you had fun<br/>
&gt; getting the first time just so you don&#39;t get set back in some bizarre got<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; get to the next level plan.  What&#39;s up with that?  Does anyone understand<br/>
&gt; that at all and can explain it logically?  I mean you had fun getting<br/>
those<br/>
&gt; xp the first time.  You get to get them all over again and have fun again?<br/>
<br/>
EQ really is more a powergamer&#39;s game, and thus loss of<br/>
experience is a penalty, not a benefit as you seem to imply.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll repeat I don&#39;t understand either why the bind location<br/>
rules are different for casters and melee.  All the arguments<br/>
I can come up with for not allowing melee to bind anywhere are<br/>
short circuited because casters can do the same thing by<br/>
binding anywhere.  Maybe if casters came back at zero mana I<br/>
could understand...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider it that big a deal though.  I dunno, maybe I<br/>
just don&#39;t die as often as you do.<br/>
