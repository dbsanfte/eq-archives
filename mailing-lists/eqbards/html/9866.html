&gt; perhaps it is based on your level compared to the mob you are chaining.  i<br/>
&gt; know if i am chaining frogs in lower guk, they do not stop at 50% health.<br/>

&gt; lower than your level will even think about running at 50%?  they don&#39;t,<br/>

&gt; fearing) i do not notice this.  it&#39;s because they are not running until they<br/>
&gt; are around 5-10% health anyway, and as soon as i chain them they stop at<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There had been some talk lately about this song having been<br/>
changed so that mobs between 25%-50% could move.  I assumed<br/>
that&#39;s what you meant when you said they had to be 5%-10% to<br/>
stop moving.<br/>
<br/>
I think the 50% thing is also level-dependent.  I remember<br/>
having to chase a griffin I was chain/fearing almost until it<br/>
was dead when I was level 30.  But lately they just stop in<br/>
their tracks at 50%.<br/>
