<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908291507">Well hmm...  Can we hear from some people that DID find the quest items?  Is there anything<br/>
special you did?  And how long did it take?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks...<br/>

&gt; if it makes you feel better my buddy camped that room for about 14 hours<br/>
&gt; straight (what a goof!) i went in there for about 2 hours the other night<br/>
&gt; with some buddies, we needed the ring from the king and i needed the<br/>
&gt; boots....   Well to make a long story short, a dozen champs, half a dozen<br/>
&gt; mages, a few shaman and not a damn king later, we got absolutely nothing,<br/>
&gt; though i did get a heart for the ranger sleeves.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello everyone.  Last night I had a disappointing fiasco in Solusek.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; got together a good group and went in to get my two bard quest items.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We headed for the king room, and managed to break the spawn (thank you<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lament).  We camped the room for about 4 hours.  Almost everyone in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; group had some quest item they wanted, and I was the only bard.  Well,<br/>
&gt; &gt; to make a long story short, after killing at least 25 solusek champions,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5 sol mages, 6 sol shamans, 25ish inferno goblins.  Not a single one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; us got a quest item.  Are these supposed to be that rare?  Are we just<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the wrong place to find these items or what?  We got a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; mediocre items off the king, but I didn&#39;t get any of them (lost the<br/>
&gt; &gt; roll).  To add insult to injury, just as I was saying I needed to go (I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had already stayed up 2 hours late), we had a bad pull, and half of us<br/>
&gt; &gt; died.  And I awoke to......Greater Feydark.  Heh... Oops.  Thank god for<br/>
&gt; &gt; revive.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any insight?  Did they nerf it with the latest patch or something?  Or<br/>
&gt; &gt; has it always been this rare for them to drop the quest items?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Frustrated,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
