check for other active movement spell effects when one<br/>

(with the exception of root/snare/chain).  If someone has SoW<br/>
on him and a bard in his group plays a faster Accelerando, he<br/>
should get the Accelerando boost.  If he drops out of song<br/>
range, he should drop back down to SoW speed.<br/>

the only bard-specific items are instruments, one of which<br/>
comes from Nagafen the dragon, one which comes from a L30ish<br/>
mob in Mistmoore, and the rest of which are no different from<br/>
store bought instruments.  Oh, and the PoF items, not that any<br/>
bard is going to be getting them soon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In terms of balance, I think we&#39;re still pretty well balanced.<br/>
I&#39;d like to see us get either another defensive skill, or the<br/>
cap on dodge raised to 200.  The defensive skills are dodge,<br/>
block, parry, and riposte.  Because we&#39;re not supposed to be<br/>
full tanks, we only get one out of four.  And then for some<br/>
strange reason the one we get is capped at half what the other<br/>
tanks get?  That puts our defensive ability closer to casters<br/>
than to tanks.  In fact I&#39;ll need to ask my cleric friends<br/>
what the cap on their dodge skill is.  I have the sinking<br/>
feeling they&#39;re just as good at tanking as we are (better<br/>
even since they&#39;re usually using a shield).<br/>
