This is a pretty good list, however, we *just* sent a message to GZ with<br/>
much of this on it.  Let&#39;s wait a bit for some sort of a response before<br/>
squeaking again ;)<br/>

I agree, this is to include in a letter which contains some other constructive (<br/>
I hope ) things, and will be to Brad.  I think GZ needs more specifics than this<br/>
letter will include.  The goal is to raise the general level of awareness of our<br/>
class to the team in general.  We&#39;ve all noticed that warriors, rogues, and<br/>
rangers get alot of tinkering.  My guess...large player base, large amount of<br/>
feedback (or in the rogue&#39;s case, very broken and embarrassing).  So, since<br/>
we&#39;re such a small group I&#39;m hoping to do a little PR with the big guy and have<br/>
him and his team think on us a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there have a list of the songs that still aren&#39;t implemented?  Are<br/>
there any?<br/>
