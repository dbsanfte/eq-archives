<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825382885"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Im a Wood Elf and my roommate plays a Highelf...can we kill the bandits<br/>
&gt;without lowering our faction with our hometowns?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The bandits he was referring to in Lesser Faydark are Half-elves, and during <br/>
beta GM&#39;s stated there was no faction loss (and that definitely seemed to be <br/>
the case) for High Elves. I don&#39;t know if any of that&#39;s changed since <br/>
commercial started, but I doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
I also heard that there is a faction loss in regards to dervishes (Desert of <br/>
Ro) when you hunt the lesser fay bandits, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true.<br/>
