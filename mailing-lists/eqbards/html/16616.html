<div id="ygrps-yiv-188382651">Another song I thought would be quite interesting would be this:<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Distructive War Cry<br/>
Level:  49+<br/>
Skill:  Singing<br/>
Description:  This song is a true battle song, the bard gives the war cry<br/>
and all group members (melee only) become so enraged that they fight at<br/>
double the normal speed (doesn&#39;t stack with other haste items) and deal<br/>
double normal damage. This lasts for 3 ticks only and is then unusable for<br/>
5/10 minutes (bard needs time to recover), a bit like Divine Aura. This<br/>
song once sung does not stack with other songs.<br/>
<br/>
* - I think this would be a great song, it&#39;s perfect for what a bard does.<br/>
The bard sings a song of inspiration and inspires his fellow comrades to<br/>
fight with pure rage. The group go into a frenzy and deal massive amounts<br/>
of melee dmg in a small space of time. Once sung the song stays greyed out<br/>
for *verant decides this* minutes. This also enhances a bard&#39;s solo&#39;ing,<br/>
but does not make them super warriors at the same time, effects last 3<br/>
ticks (15-18 seconds???).<br/>
