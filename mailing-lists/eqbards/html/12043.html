<div id="ygrps-yiv-622462110">I got my level 32 song finally this past Friday and it was definitely worth<br/>
waiting for!  It rocks!  One problem though...  I thought all my problems<br/>
would go away when I got the song, and alas, they have magnified.  We tried<br/>
taking a couple of different areas of Sol A with me in a diminished role of<br/>
being a mana maker and it didn&#39;t work out to well.  I still need to fulfil<br/>
my old role as puller (Lament), crowd control (Lullaby or Pixie depending on<br/>
the number), healing (I weave it with Clarity), chains (I can get it to<br/>
stick on A LOT of things that the druid gets 3 or 4 resists on).  What&#39;s<br/>
lost now though is MR(Guardian and Elemental) and Anthem... both sorely<br/>
missed.  Additionally, there is has been a super fine line we&#39;ve been<br/>
walking on playing clarity enough to get some mana in the party vs. running<br/>
off to get the next pull before the spawns get messed up.  I&#39;ve been lucky<br/>
that I have been able to manage the situation by pulling only to break us<br/>
into an area and space the spawns apart.  My wife (a warrior) can then pull<br/>
after that without needing Lament.  I also have a HUGE advantage in being<br/>
able to have my wife or brother-in-law give commands and maintain group<br/>
communication for me while I mash the keyboard (we all play in the same<br/>
room).<br/>
<br/>
BUT, what our parties REALLY need more then anything else is another bard to<br/>
do all the things I used to do so that I can concentrate on my new roles<br/>
:-).  Problem is there aren&#39;t enough of them to go around.  We really need<br/>
more bards.  I&#39;ve got a feeling that the sentiment is server wide on Prexus.<br/>
Yesterday afternoon, I had organized a successful 2 party assault on the<br/>
King&#39;s room and the Torturer in Sol A with my guild when I got a tell asking<br/>
me if I could go to Perma and help with Vox.  I had to decline, but I<br/>
started thinking that the state of bards must be REALLY bad on my server if<br/>
they are pleading with a level 32 bard to come play Cold Resistance songs so<br/>
that they could take Vox (I figure they already had some bards, but needed a<br/>
couple more).  I hadn&#39;t even imagined wandering into that part of Perma<br/>
until at least level 40!<br/>
