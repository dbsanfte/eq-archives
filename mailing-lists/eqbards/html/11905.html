&gt;The ranger will try to snare/root you and shoot lots of arrows.  He will<br/>
&gt;also try to cast his DD &  DoT and have his Thorns and buffs up on himself.<br/>
&gt;He also has some minor heals for himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would have elemental & guardian memmed and maybe the disenchanting melody<br/>
&gt;(if not - have a egg-shaped pumice handy  they can dispell roots - not sure<br/>
&gt;about snares).  Selos, hymn, lullaby or pixie, bellow or denon&#39;s, screetch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would start with my MR maxxed out - weaving ele & guardian.  Ranger mana<br/>
&gt;is weak and he may panic when you resist and re-cast.  The more you can <br/>
&gt;make<br/>
&gt;him cast the better. Get close to him and stay inside bow range.  Use songs<br/>
&gt;to damage at first because he will be thorned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You might try to fear chain him if you are not in the arena but just out in<br/>
&gt;a zone.  (hehe if you can pick the spot - charm an HG or Griffon &lt;eg&gt;)  <br/>
&gt;Once<br/>
&gt;you have made him use up his mana, you can play lullaby and continue song<br/>
&gt;damage.  They really hate being winced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Depending on how long the fight goes, his thorns may wear off. I&#39;d try to<br/>
&gt;wait as long as possible to melee him to prevent taking damage from his<br/>
&gt;shield of thorns.  And you can play the same game with Psalm of Warmth. If<br/>
&gt;you run away to heal or load a different song - remember he has tracking so<br/>
&gt;run to a zone edge where tracking gets all messed up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But like Harm said - you might be well served to go down in the 3rd round<br/>
&gt;for future peace and harmony ;p<br/>
