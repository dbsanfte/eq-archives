<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522769740"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve not experienced summoning.  Is anything able to summon you, over a<br/>
&gt;certain level?  If so, and I keep running away, will it just keep summoning<br/>
&gt;me?  Assuming, of course, I can run again after the initial summoning...heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t like that summoning thing...heh.  Dangit!  I&#39;m supposed to be able<br/>
&gt;to run away!!!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Any mob that is level 51+ can summon as an inate ability.  There is no<br/>
known way to stop a mob from summoning unless its mezed.  If you come<br/>
accross a 51+ critter and want to be able to get away....<br/>
1. If you don&#39;t do damage to the creature it won&#39;t summon you.<br/>
2. If the mob gets rooted it will summon anyone on its hate list, damage or<br/>
not.<br/>
3. The mob will always summon the person on the top of its hate list even<br/>
if they are in melee range all ready.<br/>
4. In general a mob can summon a player about every 30 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Some creatures use this as a tactic when they can&#39;t beat PCs fairly.<br/>
Summoning is why high level caster mobs present so much of a problem.  Not<br/>
only can the casters gate when they are low on hit points, but once they<br/>
arrive at their bind point they can start summoning players individually<br/>
and solo killing.  Thats why anytime your dealing with caster mobs 51+, you<br/>
stun when they are low.  If your fighting stuff thats level 56+ mana tap,<br/>
don&#39;t waste your time with stun.  Level 56+ caster mobs are practically<br/>
immune to stun and mez.  About the only thing that works are knockback<br/>
effects and even then the creature can regain its concentration and resume<br/>
casting.  So if your fighting a gateing/summoning mob thats 56+, mana tap<br/>
for all yoru worth.<br/>
