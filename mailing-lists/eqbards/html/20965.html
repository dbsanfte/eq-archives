<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056490744">It is time.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past couple weeks a revelation has come to me, my time in Norrath<br/>
has drawn to a close.  I&#39;m not the most eloquent bard here on the list nor<br/>
am I the most active, but I have always felt at home here.  It has been a<br/>
pleasure to read of the adventures of other bards both young and old.  I&#39;ve<br/>
even had the chance to meet and talk to some of you in game which has always<br/>
been awesome.<br/>
<br/>
The days grow long.  The nights even longer.  I can no longer justify the<br/>
time expenditure.  I can no longer sleep in late due to the previous night&#39;s<br/>
questing while ignoring my wife and children.  It is enough.<br/>
<br/>
To each of you, I say farewell.  Enjoy your time in Norrath.  I hope you<br/>
each obtain that which your hearts desire.  For me, it is enough.  To obtain<br/>
the mystical power of bard charm has completed my desire.  There is nothing<br/>
left that holds a candle to my real life at this point.<br/>
<br/>
It is time.<br/>
