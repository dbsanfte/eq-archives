I find Tarew Marr to be bristling with fun places to go and fun people to go<br/>
with, and as a bard, I get invited to do everything.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a change of groupmates would be good Maev ?<br/>

&gt; Actually though I sorta quit my bard at 54, but then pushed him to 55<br/>
&gt; for the sake of having the mana song, but have since quit altogether.<br/>
&gt; Not sure how Tarew Marr stacks up to the other servers, but it doesnt<br/>
&gt; seem too lively these days.<br/>
&gt; Have fun,<br/>
