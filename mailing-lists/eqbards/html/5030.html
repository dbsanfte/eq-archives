Yes, before I found NOTHING in Unrest (there might have been, but I never<br/>
met it) could see thru our invis.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I haven&#39;t even logged on for 3 weeks - this is just another nail<br/>
in my EQ account, I simply have no desire to fund a game that has so little<br/>
consideration for the people that play it.<br/>
<br/>
I loved my bard - and I loved crafts. They&#39;ve already destroyed the latter,<br/>
looks like they are now chipping away at the former as well.<br/>

There is simply nothing left for me to enjoy in Norrath.<br/>

&gt;I think I can pretty much confirm that Mystic Clouding used to make us<br/>
&gt;invisible to undead as well as the living, (AND our fellow group members)<br/>
&gt;but in the last 2 days the undead have seen me consistently while singing<br/>
&gt;it.  If anyone else want to test this out or has similar experience with<br/>
&gt;this, let us know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was a typical strategy for me when visiting unrest to go invis right<br/>
&gt;outside the zone, zone in, restart the song, and start shouting for a group<br/>
&gt;and wandering around the courtyard and walls.  This way I would be left<br/>
&gt;alone from suprise attacks.  Then when a group might answer me with<br/>
&gt;something like &quot;meet us in the barkeep room&quot; I would just run in and join<br/>
&gt;them, then stop the song.  Many many times I strolled right past trains from<br/>
&gt;the basement and stood next to hags, etc, without being noticed.  Not<br/>
&gt;anymore :-(  Looks like this Bard needs to learn to be a bit more careful<br/>
&gt;from now on.<br/>
