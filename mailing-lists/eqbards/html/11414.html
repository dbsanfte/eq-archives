&gt; After I pick up the item from the hot key bank, how do I get it into my<br/>
&gt; hand?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example.  I have a drum in my hand, and get jumped while I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; running.  I have a mino axe in my inv (on the hot key bank)  How Do i<br/>
&gt; Get the axe into my hand?<br/>

<br/>
Obviously people&#39;s song choices need to vary from situation to situation and<br/>
personal tastes play a role too, so this little discussion is meant more to<br/>
show my *method* than to recommend any specific song choices.  And if you<br/>
don&#39;t use my method I hope that it at least gives you an idea that will work<br/>
for you.  If other folks have a method that they feel is better, please let<br/>
me know!<br/>
<br/>
Moving weapons to and from general inventory quickly requires that you have<br/>
both your [melee 1] and [melee 2] slots also in your hotkey bank alongside<br/>
your general inventory slots.  You can quickly switch from one hotkey bank<br/>
to another through the use of SHIFT-1 through SHIFT-6, so I have 6 songs in<br/>
hotkey bank #1, 6 songs in hotkey bank #2, and inventory and melee slots in<br/>
hotkey bank #3.<br/>
<br/>
Having two banks of songs allows me to have my primary &quot;melee&quot; type songs in<br/>
bank #1, with perhaps my Magic Resist or other specific-use songs in bank 2.<br/>
Because Verant kept assigning funtions to alphabetical keyboard keys without<br/>
giving us a way to change them, I finally gave up and resigned myself to<br/>
using the numbers 1-6 for twisting my songs.  Therefore, in battle if I&#39;m<br/>
twisting three songs I&#39;m pressing &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, and &#39;3&#39; typically.  &#39;5&#39; for me<br/>
is Selo&#39;s, and usually &#39;6&#39; is some song that isn&#39;t often used like Screech<br/>
or Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
Choices, Choices.  There are a lot of useful songs to chose from, so it&#39;s<br/>
very hard to decide sometimes:<br/>
<br/>
Song #1: Celerity (Anthem at lower levels)<br/>
Song #2: Chant of Battle (maybe DDD here)<br/>
Song #3: Binding or Chains<br/>
Song #4: Pixie Strike, Hymn or Chains<br/>
Song #5: Selo&#39;s (other if in dungeon)<br/>
Song #6: Screech or Lullaby<br/>
Song #7: Guardian Rhythms (or Clarity)<br/>
Song #8: Elemental Rhythems (or Hymn)<br/>
<br/>
Hotkey bank 1:<br/>
[song 1][song 2]<br/>
[song 3][song 4]<br/>
[song 5][song 6]<br/>
<br/>
Hotkey bank 2:<br/>
[song 1][song 7]<br/>
[song 8][song 4]<br/>
[song 5][song 6]<br/>
<br/>
Hotkey bank 3:<br/>
[melee 2][melee 1]<br/>
[inv.  1][inv.  2]<br/>
[inv.  3][inv.  4]<br/>
<br/>
Hotkey bank 4:<br/>
[assist][train]<br/>
[sit   ][     ]<br/>
[      ][     ]<br/>
<br/>
The songs that I have memmed almost always at level 37 are Celerity, Selo&#39;s,<br/>
Hymn, Clarity, Chains (with Pixie Strike almost always).  That leaves two<br/>
songs that change situationally.<br/>
<br/>
So twisting three songs using bank 1 might yield Celerity (or Anthem), Chant<br/>
(or DDD), Binding.  If a casting mob joins the party, I hit SHIFT-2 and<br/>
continue twising using the same three buttons on the keyboard, but now I<br/>
might get Celerity (or Anthem), Guardian, Elemental.  Since keys &#39;1&#39;, &#39;4&#39;,<br/>
&#39;5&#39; and &#39;6&#39; stay the same between banks I put Selo&#39;s, Chains, Pixie Strike<br/>
and other frequently used songs there.  That means that whether or not<br/>
casters are in the mobs that we&#39;re fighting Pixie Strike is, say, button<br/>
&#39;4&#39;.  So if we pull to many I hit &#39;4&#39; to use Pixie Strike to mez one,<br/>
whereas if we&#39;re fighting casters and I switch to bank 2, I still hit &#39;4&#39; to<br/>
interrupt them with Pixie Strike.  This consistency between banks helps<br/>
reduce those instances where you&#39;re trying to remember which button had<br/>
Pixie Strike on it.<br/>
<br/>
If I want to change from weapons to instruments I hit SHIFT-3, click on the<br/>
weapon in [melee 1], drop it on the instrument in [inv. 2], then click in<br/>
[melee 2], and then [inv. 1] to stow down my offhand weapon after equiping<br/>
the weapon.  My method would not work at all if you wanted to try and juggle<br/>
instruments/song/weapons during combat.  I personally don&#39;t feel that the<br/>
effort and risk of dropping valuable weapons/instruments is worth the<br/>
payback.<br/>
<br/>
Hotkey bank 6 is the bank that I use when charm-fighting giants, etc. so<br/>
it&#39;s a bit odd:<br/>
<br/>
[Song 1][Song 2    ]<br/>
[Attack][Guard here]<br/>
[Song 3][Song 4    ]<br/>
<br/>
Song 1 is Song of Sirens, Song 2 is Selo&#39;s, Attack is &quot;/pet attack&quot;, Guard<br/>
here is &quot;/pet guard here&quot;, Song 3 is Chains, Song 4 is Screech.<br/>
