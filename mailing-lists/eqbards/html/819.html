heard about, and for one-handed slashing, the barbed whip is<br/>
near the top at a 0.25 damage/delay ratio.  A well-balanced<br/>
longsword is 0.24, and a combine longsword is 0.214.  (A<br/>
minotaur axe is 0.216 for reference.)  Polished granite<br/>
tomohawks eke out a mere 0.231.  The best I&#39;ve heard is a<br/>
crystalline sword at 0.289 but that is word-of-mouth - I have<br/>
been unable to confirm any of the stats on it, or if it&#39;s even<br/>
1-handed.<br/>
<br/>
(And if you&#39;re wondering how I collect all this data, I have a<br/>
spreadsheet app on my palmtop PC.  Very handy for stuff like<br/>
this.)<br/>

get the mana-regen song at L32.  That way they try to stay in<br/>
my good graces and try to group with me even if they don&#39;t<br/>
think a bard is the greatest addition to a party.  :-)  (The<br/>
clerics love me though because they get to nuke for a change<br/>
instead of having to use all their mana on heals.)<br/>
