into the gibs spawn to the point I was in one&#39;s face. They didn&#39;t attact. I <br/>
have only been attacked by them once and that was when I trained a vamp bat <br/>
into them... D&#39;oh..<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Heh, Gibs see invis to undead. Period. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would not be to sure of that, I have never had the Gibs aggro on me <br/>
&gt;while<br/>
&gt; &gt; ITU&#39;d.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;GIBs have always /conned ready to attack with invis to undead<br/>
&gt;on me.  A L50 cleric I was grouped with once said they /conned<br/>
&gt;ready to attack to her with her invis to undead too.<br/>

&gt;If you stick to the wall, they will not attack.  There&#39;s also<br/>
&gt;a chance they won&#39;t &quot;see&quot; you if you run by really quickly<br/>
&gt;(which is what I did by accident my first time, and what got<br/>
&gt;me killed my second time when I tried it again :).  See<br/>
&gt;Kitasi&#39;s posts on how aggro checks might be pulsed instead of<br/>
&gt;continuous.  (I also have a theory on this, but I&#39;m not going<br/>
&gt;to post it since it may be abusable - need to test it and send<br/>
&gt;it to Verant.)<br/>
