<div id="ygrps-yiv-785787423">Why would you want to play AE songs?  What songs are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
If you are in Guk without an enchanter, you are probably the person who will<br/>
need to do crowd control.  So, if (or more like when) you get more than one<br/>
mob, you will be doing Pixie strike.  If you have an enchanter, you will not<br/>
want to use AE and break the mobs out of their messed states (ok, Largos<br/>
does not break enchanter mez so that is one option.)<br/>
<br/>
In lower Guk, I&#39;d think you would want to buff your tanks: chant and<br/>
celerity or anthem and elemental if you are fighting casters. If you are in<br/>
a situation with multiple mobs and no crowd control, that is a problem.  And<br/>
playing area effect damage songs is not the solution.<br/>
