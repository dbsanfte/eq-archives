&gt; I recently played with a party of six in West Karana, and we tried<br/>
&gt; to kill some bandits in the bandit camp. I&#39;m interested in input<br/>
&gt; for how I can allow my more of party to survive a battle, including<br/>
&gt; myself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your biggest mistake was trying to take them on all at once. At that<br/>
level you have Lament, but even better the Druid has Harmony. Harmony is<br/>
like an area effect Lament, but outdoor only. If you don&#39;t have a druid,<br/>
Lament all but the one or 2 you plan to pull as was mentioned. Make a<br/>
big circle around the camp if you have to to reach the back ones with<br/>
lament. Make sure you get the &quot;looks sad&quot; message. Don&#39;t try to pull<br/>
past lamented ones (this used to work but now will activate the<br/>
lamented ones) If you get a resist and the whole camp comes, yell Run<br/>
Away loudly. Done right, you should be able to amaze your party by<br/>
pulling singles out of a full camp.<br/>
