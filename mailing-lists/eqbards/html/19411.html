&gt; If you start seeing faction messages from stuff that you are not killing,<br/>
&gt; beaware that you are getting transferred to other mobs hate lists.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes large, spontaneous trains have been created this way.  I harken<br/>
&gt; back to the days in Unrest pulling to the wall because we were too low to<br/>
&gt; hold rooms in the house.  Zone out every 20-30 minutes was the rule - more<br/>
&gt; like superstition.  But it sure seemed like after 45-60 minutes the next<br/>
&gt; pull would be a real dooozey! </span></blockquote></div>
