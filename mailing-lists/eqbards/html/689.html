<div id="ygrps-yiv-893029955">I remember reading this somewhere.  Any weapon that cast a spell when you<br/>
hit will also mess up your bard songs.  So stuff like the Granite Tomahawk<br/>
and the screaming mace are absolute no nos to bards.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I can confirm this one. Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side Effects&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt;at<br/>
&gt; &gt;times.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Some of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>
&gt; &gt;Root - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that generate<br/>
&gt; &gt;the &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>
&gt; &gt;             have no effect on you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I seem to remember that WHILE playing Accelerando it was possible for me to <br/>
&gt; be rooted, BUT i could cancel the effect by stopping and restarting the <br/>
&gt; song. I don&#39;t recall it ever making you immune to root. Correct if I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; wrong! =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another thing I found (to my dismay):  I was really excited when I got my <br/>
&gt; Screaming Mace. I know a bard using blunt weapons may sound strange, but if <br/>
&gt; you look at the stats the Screamer is like a magical mino axe - same dmg, <br/>
&gt; same speed, hits magical, and BONUS random Strength from it&#39;s Scream/Yaulp <br/>
&gt; (I really liked this because you could stack it on top of EVERY other Str <br/>
&gt; buff - I had like STR 175 or something with a shaman buffing me, my strength <br/>
&gt; songs, some magic items, and the Scream).<br/>
&gt; Well - it all sounds good, but I found that the Screamer causes your songs <br/>
&gt; to go out of wack. When the Scream is in effect you can&#39;t sing. You start a <br/>
&gt; song and it immediately ends with no effect. So I had to get rid of my mace <br/>
&gt; (sigh).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll post if I find that any other items cause this effect. Also would <br/>
&gt; appreciate if any other bards have experienced anything like this with other <br/>
&gt; magical items - it would be nice to post. It was rather irritating to find <br/>
&gt; this out after getting all the required components for the mace (what a damn <br/>
&gt; annoying quest).<br/>
