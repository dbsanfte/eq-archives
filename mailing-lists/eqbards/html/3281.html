<div id="ygrps-yiv-513086834">Well, if you like to group (which I do) you can try Unrest or Mistmoore.  I<br/>
personally prefer MM, but you will not be able to get any good items there<br/>
because you will be fighting the yard trash near the entrance.  If you fight<br/>
in Unrest, you can get better items by pulling or camping deeper inside the<br/>
house.  But, you will probably have to deal with the crowds of people.  On<br/>
Tarew Marr, MM usually has about 25 people in zone, 45 at peak times when<br/>
higher levels decide to storm the castle.  Unrest usually has 40 people min,<br/>
and sometimes goes well into the 80s.  BTW, both zones count as outdoors, so<br/>
you can sing Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to solo, you could try the Iron and Stone Guardians in Nektulos<br/>
Forest.  The great thing about them is that any PC can outrun them, so they<br/>
are trivial to kite.  I found them perfect for levels 19 to 21, but then<br/>
left out of boredom, not lack of experience.<br/>
<br/>
Another spot you might like to try is Lake Rathetear.  You can fight Aviak<br/>
Guards solo (look around) or you can group and fight at the Gnoll/Undead<br/>
camp during the night.  And, just over the zone, you can fight all kinds of<br/>
Aviaks in South Karana.<br/>
