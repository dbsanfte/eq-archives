<div id="ygrps-yiv-515345734">Regarding whether Bards or Rangers (or some other character type) pushes <br/>
more buttons/is more active:  I&#39;m not convinced that Bards have to do <br/>
more stuff than other character types, but what exhausts me about playing <br/>
my Bard vs playing any of my other characters (warrior, enchanter, <br/>
shaman) is the unceasing regularity of it all, and the fact that there <br/>
is no time when you can afford to take a break.  It&#39;s even worse when <br/>
you have mediocre healing, and you have to twist during downtime.  Add to <br/>
this constant rhythmic undertone all of the other stuff we have to do, <br/>
it&#39;s pretty darned tiring.<br/>
