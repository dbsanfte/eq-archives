<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926488007">I have had the great fortune to be re-accquainted with death over the last<br/>
few nights, but I think I can safely attribute that to moving homes and<br/>
losing my fast IDSN connection for a somewhat flakey 56k connection. I am<br/>
having to relearn my attack strategies to deal with the lag.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here is a tale of what happened to me a few levels back...<br/>
<br/>
I had spent most of time between the 11th and 12th choruses pounding skels<br/>
in the Steamfront Mountains. It was slow work, but with Hymn and other songs<br/>
I happily pounded the undead back into the ground, never once seeing the<br/>
illustrious Mino Hero come out of his cave, but that was all about to<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after attaining the 12th level of training I returned to Steamfront<br/>
to hear the sounds of a group of like level adventures forming a party to go<br/>
inside the minotaur caves. Thinking that I had advanced enough to safely<br/>
journey there, I contacted the party leader and made my way there. On<br/>
arriving I was greeted by a group of 5 other adventures all ready for battle<br/>
and adventure, after a round of buffing by our druid we entered the mouth of<br/>
the caves.<br/>
<br/>
Once inside we saw that another group had already taken position at a prime<br/>
location at the mouth of the many tunnels. Our group leader suggested<br/>
further in to find some Mino slavers. All the party members being first<br/>
timers to these parts agreed, and slowly we ventured farther in. At one of<br/>
the many junctions of passageways our leader bade us to stop so that he may<br/>
go off and pull some prey back to our intrepid band, with aniticpation we<br/>
waited, and then a call from our leader told us to venture forth to his<br/>
location where he had cornered a slaver. With haste we came running to his<br/>
call, my groupmates all began to attack the dreaded slaver, but I turning<br/>
the corner realized that is was not one slaver we were attacking, but many<br/>
all occupying the same space, an odd site indeed. I began into the first<br/>
stanza of Anthem de Arms, to late to stop, only to have what now apperaed to<br/>
be five slavers turn to attack me.<br/>
<br/>
You have be slain by a Minotaur Slaver..<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Sadly the same fate befell most of my group, some fortunate few had gated<br/>
themselves away from the carnage. We all agreed to meet at the cave entrance<br/>
to begin the task of retrieving our corpses. Upon arriving at the cave<br/>
entrance, I found that our brave leader had already entered the caves and<br/>
retrieved his corpse, and was now relaying the dark news that he would be<br/>
departing this world ASAP. Other parties members who had gated and were now<br/>
hearing this news choose this time to depart our group, begging other<br/>
engagements and their condolences. With great anger three of the remaining<br/>
group ventured forth under guise of camoflage to get our lost bodies. It was<br/>
hard and slow work, but with time we all were succesfull.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A sane adventurer would at this point taken off his pack for the evening and<br/>
returned to the comforts of Kelethin for a fine ale, but not I.<br/>
<br/>
Our group soon found new members, but they were spread across All of Norrath<br/>
not knowing the way to the minotaur caves. So with my trusty drum I ran<br/>
several times to where the Steamfront Mountains meet the forest of Lesser<br/>
Faydark to guide people to our groups location, and it would seem that each<br/>
time I did another party member of mine would fall victim to a stray slaver<br/>
escaped from the caves, or be mobbed by wander earth elementals. Soon I was<br/>
not only ferrying new members to the group&#39;s location, but running now<br/>
defenseless group members back to their corpses.<br/>
<br/>
In time, a full group of able-bodied and equipped adventures went forth into<br/>
the mino caves, the party that had taken post at the mouths of the tunnels<br/>
was gone, so I suggested we camp there, but the rest of my party was sorely<br/>
tired of dying and wanted to hop into the action right away. Slowly we made<br/>
our way down the tunnels once again, this time running into many slavers<br/>
that we easily defeated, so easy that one of our higher level members<br/>
decided to go and find something a little more difficult. Not a second later<br/>
she came running back to our group with Meldrath on her tail.<br/>
<br/>
You have been slain by Meldrath.<br/>
LOADING...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of of members was able to gate out succesfully, the rest of us assembled<br/>
in Kelethin for the long run back. Upon arriving at the cave entrance we<br/>
began to formulate our plan, each party member would go in with a guide both<br/>
would be camoflaged making it a tricky venture since no one had the ability<br/>
to cast see invisible. Our first member went in with our druid giude, only<br/>
to lose invis half way to his corpse. Amidst thier screams they emerged from<br/>
the mino caves trailing a slaver. With much effort we all managed to pummel<br/>
the beast into submission with our bare hands and whatver spells or songs we<br/>
had memorized.<br/>
<br/>
After a brief session of playing Hymn to heal everyone, the brave volunteer<br/>
once again entered the cave only to get lost before finding his corpse.<br/>
Panicking, he tried to make his way back to the entrance, only to have the<br/>
Mino Hero show his angry presence and slay most of the party once again.<br/>
Luckily I survived this attack by making haste to run to Ak&#39;Anon, I then<br/>
ventured back to the Steamfront entrance to wait for my parties arrival.<br/>
<br/>
Once assembled again, we ventured to the mino caves and started to shout for<br/>
the assistance of any high level players in the area. While we waited for<br/>
some reply I recieved camoflage and made my way back into the caves. Knowing<br/>
the way fairly well to where I fell, I found my corpse and started the long<br/>
process of dragging it back to safety, wearily eyeing the many slavers that<br/>
I crossed paths with. Finally dragging my lifeless body out into the<br/>
sunshine I looted my items and let my heart rate drop to a normal level.<br/>
During this time a seasoned Druid in the form of a wolf came to our aid and<br/>
began to guide people into the maze of tunnels to recover thir corpse, with<br/>
time all but one of our party had recovered their items, and the last was on<br/>
his way into the caves to complete our foul task. Just then the Mino Hero<br/>
once again showed his ugly face, and while the rest of my comrades fell once<br/>
again, the high level druid and I took turns running the beast to any guard<br/>
we could find in hopes of them defeating it. Some six guards later the beast<br/>
was dead.<br/>
<br/>
In the end once tht party was reassembled, our last party member let the<br/>
Wolf Druid loot his corpse for him and upon the successfully reclaimation,<br/>
this fine person offered to group gate us to anyplace in Norrath some we may<br/>
have a more fuitful adventure, but alas we were all far to tired to<br/>
contemplate another travel to some distant land. With many thanks with broke<br/>
our company and all headed to our respective homelands.<br/>
