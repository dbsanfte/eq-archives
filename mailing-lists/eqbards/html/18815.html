included.  (Don&#39;t get me wrong I LOVE enduring breath on the gloves!!!!<br/>

But nobody has suggested alternatives.  I would love to see ideas on things<br/>
we could get (be realistic) that we can&#39;t already do with songs that we use<br/>
relatively regularly.<br/>

&gt; i&#39;ve never used forage nor complained about a low cap.  and i hate the<br/>
&gt; effects on the legs and boots =)  level 25 is &quot;nifty&quot; to get something<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; this.  level 53 to get these is completely useless.  a warrior getting<br/>
&gt; invisibility at level 53 however is something they would absolutely DIE<br/>
for.<br/>
&gt; all 51+ bards already have to deal with a majority of useless songs above<br/>
&gt; 50.  now we have to deal with useless effects on the majority of our<br/>
armor.<br/>
&gt; and still i play my bard and love my bard.  and i&#39;ve never bashed verant<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; complained about class balance.  but i won&#39;t make up excuses to justify<br/>
&gt; these effects being worth anything.  it&#39;s like a bad joke.  sorry i am at<br/>
&gt; work and cranky, no offense.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Everyone seems to be using Summon Food and Drink as the prime<br/>
&gt; &gt; examples of<br/>
&gt; &gt; uselessness.  Well aren&#39;t we the class that has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; complaining rather<br/>
&gt; &gt; loudly for over a year that our forage was capped so darned low?  Well<br/>
&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t we?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warrior Greaves cast Invisibility.  That&#39;s cool, but we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a song for that<br/>
&gt; &gt; guys.  Think about it, we *don&#39;t* have songs that can summon<br/>
&gt; &gt; food and drink.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s kinda nifty, but I will admit that I hope the BP<br/>
&gt; &gt; casts Gate.<br/>
