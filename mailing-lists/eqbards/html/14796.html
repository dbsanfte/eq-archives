<div id="ygrps-yiv-822418561">Hehe,<br/>
<br/>
Just thought of this, ok, so I am kinda bored...<br/>
<br/>
Go to South Karana. Charm Herman the hermit.  Then take him up to Valen<br/>
Nostrolo and let them fite it out. Hehe, might have to re-charm Herm and<br/>
keep sic&#39;ing him onto Vahlen.  And after Vahlen kills Herm, you&#39;d need to<br/>
zone.  But I think that would be kinda funny to see the two of them going at<br/>
it &lt;eg&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
p.s. ya, sometimes I will charm Ren&#39;Rexx or Ghnex Drah and run them down to<br/>
fite the Tesch Gnolls in a valient but futile effort to win back their home.</div>
