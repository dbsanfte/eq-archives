<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-318095214">Ummm, no magic there simple math assuming the damage distribution were<br/>
linear or bell curved (which it isn&#39;t).  Max damage is 2xDMG+1 ie for<br/>
Longsword at DMG=6  Max damage = 13, min damage = 1.  So  (13+1)/2 = 7 or<br/>
DMG+1.  Works for everything since max is 2xDMG +1 and min is 1 and divisor<br/>
is 2.  However, skill and strenght place an unbalanced curve on damage<br/>
dealt.  Running the numbers over 100 swings last week versus a white<br/>
opponent, with skill maxed at 80 and str=75 damage averaged out at 10.2 on a<br/>
weapon that has a max of 13.  Safe to assume its a percentage relationship<br/>
given the data so, actual average was 10.2/13 = 78% of max or exactly<br/>
1.2xDMG.  100 swings is statistically awfully low actually, especially given<br/>
the clumpiness factor of Verant&#39;s random number generator, but if you watch,<br/>
you will do closer to max much more often than you do 1, unless you fight a<br/>
lot of red critters.  Note that this same clumpiness favors fast weapons<br/>
unless the target has a damage shield.  Missing 5 times in row doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter much if it takes 75 hits to kill something.  If it takes only 25<br/>
blows hitting to kill it those same 5 straight misses hurt a lot, will get<br/>
you killed even.  Speed is the only defense against bad runs of &quot;luck&quot;, but<br/>
it will average you out.  Your fights will be more predictable, but you<br/>
won&#39;t be able to push the envelope as far.<br/>

          Great stuff! (how&#39;s Finland these days) But I am curious how you <br/>
     came to the Damage +1 equaling the average damage potential of a <br/>
     weapon.  I pretty sure your right, from observed damage while playing <br/>
     but is there something you know that confirms this.  For example do <br/>
     you know how to calculate Max damage?<br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks,<br/>

  Ok, I still don&#39;t understand why I seem to be the only one that is<br/>
noticing what is wrong with the damned formula for weapon <br/>
efficiency used just about everywhere. That max damage / delay. <br/>
You don&#39;t do max damage with a weapon.. you do _average_ <br/>
damage. Yes dex and str and skill will make it closer to max <br/>
more often, but on those battles where damage efficiency<br/>
really counts as anything (meaning a tough foe, if its a real wimp <br/>
who cares what you wield, you sing back more health probably<br/>
than what it can do to you) you are doing really rarely max damage. <br/>
Now change the formula to damage+1 / delay and it represents<br/>
the average damage. And better yet to ease it out, do the reverse <br/>
calculation of delay/dmg+1 and it is way easier to check efficiencies <br/>
in your head without a calculator ;)<br/>
