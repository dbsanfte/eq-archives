<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-715558935">It was probably used by FoH or Afterlife to kill a dragon in Veeshan&#39;s<br/>
Peak without the predetermined requisate number of deaths occuring. As<br/>
killing a dragon without the prescribed number of deaths occuring<br/>
violates the Vision[tm] it was necessary to remove this spell from the<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since the first Vox killing, which brought us L45 polar bears and<br/>
ice spiders running rampant all over permafrost in the next patch, it&#39;s<br/>
been obvious that killing a dragon in a way that&#39;s considered &quot;easier&quot;<br/>
than the Verant designers intended it to be is taken as a personal<br/>
affront.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been wondering as well, why, after killing Trakanon and getting a<br/>
tooth, it was necessary to also do not one but many mindnumbing camps of<br/>
rare spawns to get your Veeshan&#39;s Peak key. Now, with the GM&#39;s comment<br/>
about not supposed to be there for 6 months, I finally understand.<br/>
Dispite their protests to the contrary, Verant relies on this stupidity<br/>
to slow the players down.<br/>

&gt; Also, as a cleric in my guild pointed out.. how is Mark of Karn so<br/>
&gt; imbalanceing when there are what like 7 copies of it on our server?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>
&gt; &gt; of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>
&gt; &gt; desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>
&gt; &gt; duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; value decreased.  <br/>
