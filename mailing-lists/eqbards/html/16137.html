<b>Subject:</b> Song/Spell Descriptions... am I the only one... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038232292">Tell me, am I the only one that thinks it&#39;s absolutely rediculous that<br/>
Verant does not include a brief description of what songs/spells do when you<br/>
right click on the scroll or their icon in your book?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, seriously.  A bard would spend years studdying a song to use in<br/>
their travels and then not know what it does until they use it a few dozen<br/>
times??  A wizard would research and find components then have to combine<br/>
them in the right order and not know what the spell did?<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me or does the &quot;reality&quot; get a bit suspended there?  I&#39;m not<br/>
saying we need something like &quot;This song does XYZ dmg over XYZ minutes&quot; but<br/>
a brief description like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The song will dammage your oponent slowly over time due to the discordant<br/>
tones as well as lowering his armor class due to the distraction it is<br/>
causing him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For each song/spell this would be invaluable and would really not be all<br/>
that hard to implement.  All they&#39;d need to do is spend an hour or 2 to do<br/>
this for every spell/song in the game.  Hell, given about 20-30 minutes I<br/>
could do it for all the bard songs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never understood why we&#39;re kept in the dark as to what spells/songs do<br/>
once we have them.  I could understand not having it on the spell sheet<br/>
before it&#39;s in the book, but once you&#39;ve scribed it the book should have the<br/>
description.  That&#39;s just &#39;real&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else?<br/>

&gt; About that binding song... this is why its a good reason to like read song<br/>
&gt; descriptions to find out if they&#39;re AE BEFORE you decide to play them in a<br/>
&gt; crowded dungeon or well some place like Mistmoore.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Over time I have found in an all instrument attack this combo:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DDD<br/>
&gt; CoD<br/>
&gt; Largos Binding,<br/>
&gt; Hymn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; keeps you more ahead of the game than swapping Purifying Rhythms for Hymn,<br/>
&gt; even when you keep the three instrument swap going.&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish I had thought to try that.  My four song combo of choice was DDD,<br/>
&gt; CoD, Hymn and then a Bellow.  I found it was adequate, but that I would go<br/>
&gt; back to the three song combo when things got hairy.  I sadly underutilized<br/>
&gt; Hymn (and then Chains) for a long time, until I figured out how potent<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; could be.  (It probably all dates back to that bard who ridiculed me for<br/>
&gt; using the all-song combo when I was 22 and she was 28 because she &quot;didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like it&quot;...her combo of choice was hymn, chains and anthem with weapons.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, your posts are making me seriously consider making another bard on my<br/>
&gt; server (or another one, I don&#39;t care) and working him up to crags again :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a side note, my beloved ogre warrior is now 19 and desperately seeking<br/>
&gt; his surname.  He wouldn&#39;t last very long in EK soloing crags between 22<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; 26 =) (or at least I don&#39;t think he would)<br/>
