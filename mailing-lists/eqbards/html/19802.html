Subject: [eqbards] A Lone Bard in Runnyeye?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How would a lone bard fare soloing in Runnyeye at level 30?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know its a weird question but I need to get some items and every time I<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; into Runnyeye its empty and all my guildmates are in Kunark<br/>
<br/>
A whole lot of greenies will go agro on you. The king room solo isn&#39;t an<br/>
option since Borxx (named evil eye) is level 32, few HP but he hits for 70s.<br/>
The knight room is possible if most of them don&#39;t agro based on level. With<br/>
the exception of Borxx nothing in there should present a problem solo but<br/>
it&#39;s getting swarmed that&#39;s a problem. I do recall my ranger (on corpse<br/>
recovery run) was able to get just outside the king room at 29th level and<br/>
not agro those goblins outside. The Elites and king would have gone agro for<br/>
sure though.<br/>
