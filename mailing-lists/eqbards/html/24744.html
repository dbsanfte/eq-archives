<div id="ygrps-yiv-667095400">No in any kind of competent group, the pet wont outdamage the group, so its<br/>
not an issue.  I was reffering to solo charming.  I never worried about only<br/>
getting half xp for half my charm kills, I would just let my pet kill mob1<br/>
then i would fear kite my pet to death.  Getting 1.5 mobs worth of xp I<br/>
guess.  To be honest, I spent probably less than 10 hours total of my bard<br/>
life solo charming.  I found it boring...    Live and learn.  In any case,<br/>
if you are worried about the xp halving, charm the other mob once and mem<br/>
blur it...<br/>
<br/>
If your group is getting outdamaged by your pet, itsd time to find a new<br/>
group...<br/>
