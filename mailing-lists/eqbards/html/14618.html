to gate in, but the exp and time investment in the break).  LoD could zone<br/>
into a fully populated PoH and kill Innoruuk himself in 6 hours, easy.<br/>
Now, the time is closer to 9 or 12 due to the extremely bugged NPC&#39;s.  The<br/>
extra 50% to 100% increase in the time required is ludicrous, considering<br/>
it is due to bugged NPC&#39;s and pets.<br/>
<br/>
	If Verant wants to make the zone harder by giving NPC&#39;s more hp&#39;s,<br/>
making them hit harder, giving them better AE attacks, etc.  That&#39;s fine,<br/>
everyone will adjust.  But when PoH can easily turn into a 3 hour &quot;unstick<br/>
1 NPC&quot; trip, that&#39;s completely unacceptable.<br/>

&quot;doable&quot; if I&#39;m standing on top of Innoruuk&#39;s corpse (or Innoruuk is<br/>
standing on top of mine) when the day is done.  Clearing a small<br/>
percentage of the zone does not make PoH &quot;doable&quot; for me.<br/>

&gt;   have been introduced in this new Sky version; I wouldnt doubt that<br/>
&gt;   Verant has increased the difficulty of the area to prevent players<br/>
&gt;   from getting too far before expansion.  Again, to my knowledge no<br/>
&gt;   server has gotten very far in Sky after the recent upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Right now the rewards just doesn&#39;t seem to match up to the<br/>
difficulty.  Sure, a warrior or ranger haste belt is nice, but why bother<br/>
when RBB&#39;s or CoF&#39;s are dropped off something that&#39;s just as easy to kill,<br/>
but won&#39;t train cause there&#39;s only one of them?  LoD has been very passive<br/>
about the planes and dragons recently, but when we do get off our butts to<br/>
do something the consensus is that dragons are the only thing that are<br/>
worth the investment in time and effort.  2 hours for 4 or 5 guaranteed<br/>
nice items.  This, as opposed to 6 hours clearing 20 monsters and dying<br/>
multiple times to a bugged Spite Golem, while the roamers are dropping<br/>
next to nothing.  Or, braving the Plane of Sky encountering trains of<br/>
dragon difficulty monsters.<br/>
<br/>
	Now, I say this coming from a background of having done as much as<br/>
I have.  Dragons and planes have lost most of its luster and it&#39;s more<br/>
about helping friends and guildmates get that item they&#39;ve been dreaming<br/>
about.  I do urge everyone to go to each of the planes and see what its<br/>
like for yourself.  My first few trips into each of the planes and all of<br/>
the dragons were simply amazing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   to participate.  Again, very little control of the matter, since <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m not a recognized leader on the server.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Alot of it is making the organizer of the event listen, and simply<br/>
refusing to go if they don&#39;t.  In my opinion, a dragon raid with 40 or 50<br/>
people under level 45 is doomed from the start, and I wouldn&#39;t even take<br/>
the time to go before they start asking for help with CR.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   That was my issue with resistances and where exactly a bard fits into<br/>
&gt;   the dragon picture.  In the end, bards are not necessary for dragon<br/>
&gt;   attacks, despite what Verant seems to believe.  While you will not<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I&#39;m not so sure about that.  I think the way it has evolved is<br/>
that the better equipped you are, the less important the bard becomes.<br/>
However, at the start, I honestly believe that having the bard makes a<br/>
tremendous difference.  I just think bards are phasing themselves out of<br/>
how important they are as the people they are with become better equipped.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   difference to me.  Yet, bard instruments drop from dragons, where <br/>
&gt;   honestly, bards are just kinda an afterthought nowadays even in <br/>
&gt;   groups who are not as decked out in cold gear.  They&#39;d rather have<br/>
&gt;   another cleric or another warrior in the bard slot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	In the groups consisting of mostly warriors, yes, another warrior<br/>
or cleric would be better.  The bard is most useful in groups of<br/>
monks/rogues, where the bard makes up for their lack of hit points and<br/>
allows the clerics time to heal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I&#39;m willing to bet that there is the same thing at play here.<br/>
&gt;   We just don&#39;t know it yet.  I have yet to see for myself the<br/>
&gt;   impact of high resistance on dragons, though I would agree<br/>
&gt;   using it wont hurt me, I still want to know the formula involved<br/>
&gt;   with checking and using the resistance number in combat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I would as well, I just wish there was a good way to test this.<br/>
