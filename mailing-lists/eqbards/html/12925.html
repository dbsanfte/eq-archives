&gt; we often have to leave our own guildmates behind.  I have often been asked<br/>
&gt; why we don&#39;t invite another guild along to share in the experience of<br/>
&gt; killing a dragon.  The answer is simple, to do so would mean leaving<br/>

dragons alive long enough for others to kill them.  Dunno if<br/>
that&#39;s actually the case.  But sharing means sharing with<br/>
others who want what you&#39;re sharing, not just sharing with<br/>
your friends.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I&#39;ve seen done is for the multi-guild coordinated party<br/>
to take over the /ooc or /auction channel and use that for<br/>
coordination in lieu of /guildsay.  (/shout too, but that can<br/>
get annoying for others in the zone.)<br/>
