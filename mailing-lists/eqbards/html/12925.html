dragons alive long enough for others to kill them.  Dunno if<br/>
that&#39;s actually the case.  But sharing means sharing with<br/>
others who want what you&#39;re sharing, not just sharing with<br/>
your friends.<br/>

to take over the /ooc or /auction channel and use that for<br/>
coordination in lieu of /guildsay.  (/shout too, but that can<br/>
get annoying for others in the zone.)<br/>
