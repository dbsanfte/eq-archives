<div id="ygrps-yiv-831036624">So the first of the Chant series is the lvl 30 song right?  Not the lvl 1<br/>
song ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that helps a lot of people out there, but those of us who cannot<br/>
cast them yet will just have to wait.  At least we didn&#39;t have to endure<br/>
them not working.  Gotta love the answer on looking into problems with<br/>
Lullaby, not until after expansion which is more important.  Must be the<br/>
same answer for our missing spells under 50th level.  Sigh.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone tried medleying just 4 dot&#39;s in combat?  (not<br/>
&gt; that this is optimal but it would be interesting to see<br/>
&gt; the result). ;)<br/>

Yes, a lot of bards have been discussing it at The Concert<br/>
Hall.  The damage you can do with the new DoTs is enough to<br/>
&quot;steal&quot; kills from other tanks.  Seems with this fix our<br/>
damage finally matches our position in the grand scheme of<br/>
things - in between casters and tanks - instead of being the<br/>
class with the lowest damage output in the game.<br/>
