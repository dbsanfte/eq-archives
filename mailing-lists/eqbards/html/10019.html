<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025624447"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Druids get track at 20.  They get to put one practice point into it, and<br/>
&gt;there it stays, never improving.  Yet it IS useful, sometimes even more<br/>
&gt;useful than high level ranger tracking. This is because the druid tracks<br/>
&gt;what is nearby, the ranger tracks what is on the other side of the zone.<br/>
&gt;Many times I&#39;ve had rangers tell me high level tracking sucks.  In this one<br/>
&gt;instance, maybe bards got the best deal of all - mid range tracking. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES! Ranger tracking at high levels is quite horrible.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, you can only track 20 things at a time. And those 20 things are<br/>
listed in order of spawn - newest on the top - within your range.<br/>
<br/>
So a ranger in Oasis will have a range of nearly the whole zone (because<br/>
their skill level is so high)  - which means that they can only see the<br/>
newest 20 things (which are usually the gators which are frequently<br/>
spawning). Thus, tracking a sand giant that has been around 5 minutes is<br/>
often impossible. Whereas a druid or bard would have a much better chance<br/>
(since they can move their tracking range around by running around, thus<br/>
breaking the zone down, and letting them see all the mobs).<br/>
<br/>
Ranger tracking also sucks if you&#39;re in a big zone like Karanas... looking<br/>
for aviak advocats, say. One spawns, you track it... ends up that it is 20<br/>
minutes away! Now not only have you wasted 20 minutes getting there, but<br/>
someone else has already started fighting it. :(<br/>
<br/>
Ranger tracking can&#39;t be beat if you&#39;re trying to watch for spawns in an<br/>
entire zone. But for the actual purpose of TRACKING something down, it is<br/>
often quite useless. :P<br/>
