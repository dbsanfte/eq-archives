&gt; Hello I am at lvl 12 Wood elf bard.  it seems that I cannot find a good<br/>
&gt; place for me to solo.  I went to CB but the orc&#39;s hit so hard that it<br/>
keeps<br/>
&gt; disrupting my song.  I died 5 times in there.  I went to Nro and all the<br/>
&gt; places has been camp out.  I was wondering if anyone know a good place to<br/>
&gt; solo at lvl 12.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanx,<br/>
&gt; Your Friendly Rogue and Bard,<br/>
