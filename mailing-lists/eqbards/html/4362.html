<div id="ygrps-yiv-322591968">&quot;hmm, I think I will try my chords of dissoannce song. have not used it<br/>
since the guard whacked me.  I wonder how all of the orc&#39;s will like it?  oh<br/>
my goodness they really don&#39;t like it!  lots of them really don&#39;t like it!<br/>
Help! help! help! I better run for the zone!  no wait, there is that<br/>
powerful caster maybe he will help me if I run over to him!  Help! help!<br/>
Please zap the dorcs off me help!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
now can u mem your songs faster than he can mem his spells? course he was<br/>
bound right across the zone and you were bound in the arena &lt;oh well&gt;<br/>
<br/>
now if you have an enchanter friend or a high level bard friend who can mez<br/>
and memblur or charm... well that&#39;s another story - hehe love to see the<br/>
evil killstealer casters burn that mana casting on a charmed mob &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
