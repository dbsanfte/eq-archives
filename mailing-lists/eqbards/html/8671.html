<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850627708">could Mynthi actually drop a different lute now?  i don&#39;t know anyone who<br/>
has gotten one after the patch, only those that have had the lute of the<br/>
gypsy princess since before yesterday&#39;s patch.  or do the other gypsy<br/>
musicians now carry a different lute?  well all i know is the LotGP doesn&#39;t<br/>
get you the breastplate =(<br/>
i will let you know what my server GM says after 2pm PST when i have my wife<br/>
talk to him.<br/>

&gt; changed to NO DROP after the patch, so who knows. <br/>
