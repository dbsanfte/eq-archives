<b>Subject:</b> RE: Proc&#39;ing; Dex vrs Wis (was Bard PvP) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901901035">everyone believes it to be dex.  i have yet to hear that wisdom plays a<br/>
role.  i think the consensus on dex is that if you hit more often, you will<br/>
proc more often.  sounds like it makes sense, but the problem is you do NOT<br/>
have to hit to proc, you just have to swing.  i have taken notice of this<br/>
after asking a level 50 warrior friend of mine for advice on stats for my<br/>
paladin, and he mentioned that.  with my paladin, for a fact i have seen<br/>
myself miss the first 3 swings of a fight, i inflicted no melee damage, yet<br/>
my ghoulbane definitely did proc.  dunno if this is common knowledge to<br/>
everyone, it surprised me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;  I could have sworn that DEX was the stat that helped a proc&#39;ing <br/>
&gt;      weapon.  Is it wisdom or dex????  (If it&#39;s wisdom then <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll never <br/>
&gt;      bother with proc&#39;s, my wisdom is very low and all my items are <br/>
&gt;      targeted at adding to str, agl, dex, and cha.  I&#39;d need <br/>
&gt; to grow a <br/>
&gt;      couple of extra arms to wear the wisdom stuff....  :P  )<br/>
