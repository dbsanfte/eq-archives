<b>Subject:</b> Low on mana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-821108681">I joined a pickup group in Karnors that consisted of a monk, rogue, cleric,<br/>
shaman, paladin and myself.  At 50, I was the lowest level person in the<br/>
group.  We camped at the skeleton tower.  The monk was pulling so I told him<br/>
to always bring two mobs if he could so I could charm one.  From that point<br/>
on we were a non-stop killing machine.  I would have to say of all the<br/>
pickup groups I have ever joined, this one was far and away the most<br/>
efficient.  The shaman always hit the mobs with a 75% slow.  The paladin<br/>
chained stunned.  The monk and rogue dished out massive melee damage.<br/>
Cleric healed when necessary, which wasn&#39;t that often due to the shaman<br/>
slows and pally stuns.  Because we were almost always fighting 2-3 mobs, I<br/>
was constantly charming.  We killed the mobs fast and the cleric and shaman<br/>
usually ended each fight with 70%+ mana.  As a result, the monk was non-stop<br/>
pulling.  After about 90 minutes of carnage, I was down to less than one bub<br/>
of mana left.  Until last night, I had never dropped below 50% mana when I<br/>
was responsible for crowd control.  So for the first time ever, I had to<br/>
tell my party I was low on mana.  The monk started splitting the pulls to<br/>
make sure he only brought one mob back to the group in order to let me get<br/>
back up to at least 1 full bub.  A couple of the party members stated they<br/>
had never heard of a bard being low on mana before.  At that point, we all<br/>
made various comments along the lines of &quot;great group&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m getting massive<br/>
EXP&quot;, etc.  The ultimate compliment was when I told them I had to leave.<br/>
They decided to move down to the moat corners since I would no longer be<br/>
there to charm.  All in all one of the most enjoyable playing sessions I<br/>
have ever had.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else ever been in a situation when they almost ran out of mana due to<br/>
charming (and not when soloing using charm kiting)?  <br/>
