<div id="ygrps-yiv-500688600">While I agree that Disenchanting Melody is useless I have used two of the<br/>
other songs you mentioned recently:<br/>
<br/>
MMM I use this regularly to help the group get away from single large mobs<br/>
(like giants and griffons) either when a fight goes bad or when we are<br/>
suprised (outside only of course). For instance last week I was in a group<br/>
that teleported into the druid gate in North Karana. Unfortunately there was<br/>
a giant right by the gate and he attacked us. Because I have a fast<br/>
connection I regained control first and used MMM to get a bit of space<br/>
between us and the giant - we all survived.<br/>
Its also handy in duelling if you get blinded, by a paladin for instance.<br/>
<br/>
I also used identify last week to find out which part of the rune of one eye<br/>
I had for my lambent armour quests. Its the only time I have used this song<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see identify replaced but MMM is far from useless IMHO, at<br/>
least while there is still stuff to fight outside. I have never used the<br/>
psalm series in anger and would like to see these made more useful.<br/>

<br/>
Can&#39;t say that I have ever groupped with anybody that said...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...my god kerouac - thank god your here... please play that see invis song<br/>
please&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;...wow, never knew bards could sing a so I could see invis - cool&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t most casters get see invis WAY before  lvl 24?  And most humans have<br/>
found a way to deal with the night vision by lvl 24, unless there is a<br/>
recent death involved...  That&#39;s what I mean when I say useless...<br/>
<br/>
There is no doubt alot of our songs are specialized, like the psalm series<br/>
and such... but, there are about 6 uselss -  they are TOO specialized.<br/>
<br/>
MMM, Disenchanting, Identify jump right to mind, am I to toss the lvl 24<br/>
song into that same heap now?  Can they be used, yes... are they useful - I<br/>
have not found them useful.<br/>
<br/>
I just think that if Verant is gonna limit our songs to 50, and then not<br/>
really implement 50... that there shouldn&#39;t be that many lemons...<br/>
