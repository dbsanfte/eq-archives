&gt; &gt; Why would the trip from Qeynos to Freeport take 45<br/>
&gt; &gt; minutes? With selo&#39;s you can easily make it in 20.<br/>

&gt; You&#39;re obviously thinking of someone else. You claimed in<br/>
&gt; one of your replies that I must have a lot of lag. I never<br/>
&gt; said that, nor agreed with you. I have cable modem service<br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t have 500-600 ms lag. I don&#39;t &quot;selo-run almost<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you think you can make it from Qeynos to Freeport in<br/>
&gt; 20 minutes I&#39;d love to see you do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dunno about 20 minutes.  I&#39;m pretty sure I could do it in 25.<br/>
I made it from Freeport to the centaur village and back in a<br/>
half hour.  I&#39;ll have to try timing a run to Qeynos (adds the<br/>
long run through WK, which is why I don&#39;t think I could do it<br/>
in 20).  I need to find out which is faster time-wise anyway -<br/>
going through Highpass and taking the long ramp down in EK, or<br/>
going through Rivervale/Misty/Beholder&#39;s.<br/>
