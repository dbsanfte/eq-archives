<div id="ygrps-yiv-55923381">Since our speedup songs don&#39;t stack with the enchanter line of speed buffs,<br/>
that seems to indicate in most situations where you have an enchanter in the<br/>
group it would be better to sing Chant of Battle instead of Anthem.  This<br/>
assumes that the mana cost for the enchanter speed buffs are relatively low<br/>
and as a result the enchanter can cast the buffs on a regular basis.  My<br/>
experience with the enchanter speed buffs is that they only last for a short<br/>
while.  Does the duration increase based on the level of the enchanter<br/>
and/or type of spell?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to think that the smart thing to do when you group with an<br/>
enchanter is to agree on what role each of you will play in the party,<br/>
similar to the agreement on which songs you will sing when you group with<br/>
another bard.  Since both classes can provide speed buffs and crowd control,<br/>
they agree on which one the bard will focus on so the enchanter doesn&#39;t<br/>
waste mana providing a service the bard can provide for free.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The attack speedup of Warsong and Anthem do not stack with<br/>
&gt; Quickness, Alacrity, (enchanter) Celerity, nor Augmentation.  <br/>
&gt; The faster prevails, although I only tested it with the song<br/>
&gt; played after the spell, not vice versa.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reduction in attack delays were (1 - new_delay/old_delay):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anthem ~10%<br/>
&gt; Augmentation ~15%<br/>
&gt; Quickness ~20%<br/>
&gt; Warsong ~20%<br/>
&gt; Alacrity ~25%<br/>
&gt; (enchanter) Celerity ~33%<br/>
