&gt;Level 8 song lowers reaction time and two things referred to in the strat<br/>
&gt;guide as &quot;Help and AGRO,&quot; though I&#39; haven&#39;t figured out how those translate<br/>
&gt;into the game...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just have to clear this up, and share how I use the song.  First, consider<br/>
it a NON-combat song in many ways.  If you sneak up on a goblin camp, and<br/>
spy four of the beasts, grab your lute and make three &quot;sad&quot; while they<br/>
loiter about.  If you approach and attack the fourth, you will notice the<br/>
other three &quot;sad&quot; goblins will not join the fray.  You can then back off a<br/>
bit and fight the sole goblin, effectively picking each one off one at a<br/>
time in this manner!<br/>
<br/>
And who says Bards aren&#39;t built for Soloing?<br/>
<br/>
Must say the song came in handy in the Qeynos sewers, as a way to pacify an<br/>
especially mean-looking NPC as I swam past.  And O how I used it on my<br/>
journey from Kelethin, really made the Highold Pass a Cakewalk Pass.<br/>
