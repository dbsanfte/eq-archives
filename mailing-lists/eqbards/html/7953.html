<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587772579">I have to agree with Miriana and Sylly.  If someone wants to twink, they <br/>
should go ahead and twink.  The idea of twinking my own characters <br/>
bothered me at first, because I prefer to &quot;do it myself&quot;, but there are <br/>
several reasons why I got over it.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you are a powergamer, and are generally at the crest of the <br/>
high-level wave moving up on a server, the following happens way too <br/>
often:<br/>
<br/>
At roughly level 20, I am in Highpass with a group of five other <br/>
like-levelled players, none of which is a direct-dealing magic user.  On <br/>
four occasions, the named Orc spawned.  The six of us pile on, we whack <br/>
away.  Who gets the kill?  One of the level 16 soloing Wizards sitting on <br/>
 the rocks on the edge.  Four times.<br/>
<br/>
Or:  I am in Oasis with three other players of a level appropriate to <br/>
take out Lockjaw.  He spawns.  Some idiot shouts &quot;Lockjaw at second <br/>
pillar&quot;, four players in the 30 range come over to take him out.  They <br/>
are not together, they are each hoping to take out Lockjaw for <br/>
themselves.  What does a level 30 player need with a Lockjaw vest?<br/>
<br/>
Or:  I am in Highkeep.  The first time there (level 10) there were a <br/>
total of six players there in the middle of a Saturday.  My party, <br/>
killing prisoners.  Recently, I am in Highkeep with a group of six <br/>
low-20s, trying to hold the upper room, (25 to 35 people there) and what <br/>
keeps happening?  Soloing level 34s come in and announce that they are <br/>
taking spawn points.  Or:  soloing level 34s come in invisible, sit on <br/>
the doorjamb, and blast anything we&#39;re fighting as soon as it has taken <br/>
roughly half damage.<br/>
<br/>
I currently have eight entirely full backpacks sitting in the bank, with <br/>
full equipment on my character, and NOT ONE of the items in the bank or <br/>
on my person (with the exception of some that are not usable by Bards, <br/>
and are for sale if I ever have the patience) is an item I earned during <br/>
a fight.  Why?  Because when *I* get to any area in the game that is a <br/>
reasonable challenge for players of my level, and that area has nice <br/>
loot, it is ALWAYS camped by KSing wizards, high-level loot gatherers, or <br/>
even, simply, players who really should have moved on to something <br/>
tougher but have just not bothered to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I have been detailed to NYC for the last three months for five days a <br/>
week, so I get to play only on (crowded) weekends.  My former fighting <br/>
partners are ten to sixteen levels above me.  As far as I am concerned, <br/>
anything they want to hand down to me is fair game.<br/>
<br/>
They have provided me with:  silver-plated leggings and a silver-plated <br/>
bracer, thulian claws, a water crystal staff, and some pauldron and belt <br/>
whose names I forget, but are pretty useful.  I did not &quot;earn&quot; any of <br/>
these in the conventional sense, but the way things work on an aging <br/>
server, I never will, so tough.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a level 10 warrior that I started a few weekends ago (so I <br/>
could solo something relatively mindless for those times when I could no <br/>
longer stand grouping - why is it always me that gets to:  lure, announce <br/>
the presence of spawns, direct who should med and when, announce who to <br/>
assist, instruct who to heal, and keep track of loot order?)  Part of the <br/>
fun of playing this warrior has been the surprise acts of kindness from <br/>
total strangers.  I received (free) an FS rapier, three derv rings, a <br/>
ringmail tunic, and countless unasked for buffs, heals and cures.  Not to <br/>
mention the three marriage proposals (oh, I&#39;m a female human warrior, <br/>
hehe, blond).  I do not feel that this detracted from my game-playing <br/>
experience one bit.  In fact, it made it a lot more fun.<br/>
<br/>
One more place where twinking helped me out:  I managed to get my <br/>
Smithing up to the point where banded armor is cost-effective to make <br/>
just about the time when prices collapsed.  The only thing that let me <br/>
walk away from the experience with a profit (and without bitterness) was <br/>
the four twinked players each of whom bought complete sets of banded from <br/>
 me for 125pp, no questions asked.<br/>
<br/>
More twinking!<br/>
