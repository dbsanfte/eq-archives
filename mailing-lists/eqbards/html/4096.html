<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351261044">I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players <br/>
because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our <br/>
behinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out <br/>
in part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford <br/>
buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that <br/>
until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces <br/>
(or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate <br/>
would I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I <br/>
play. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them - <br/>
sure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. It&#39;s <br/>
not a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making the <br/>
most out of EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Twinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>

&gt;immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>
&gt;sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>
&gt;whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>
&gt;for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>
&gt;to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>
&gt;by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>
&gt;be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13. </span></blockquote></div>
