<b>Subject:</b> Imbrued Armor updated Last patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794341198">Good news - the imbrued plate dropped in the alter planes for Bards has<br/>
received an upgrade in AC for several pieces. I don&#39;t know what all the<br/>
changes were, but ac upgrades are always welcome.<br/>
<br/>
The other good news is Imbrued is now dropping again in Plane of Hate.<br/>
It hasn&#39;t dropped since the patch that tweaked the Monster AI in PoH,<br/>
and now drops on scorn banshees.<br/>
