&gt; Just to clarify, I&#39;m on a cable modem and my ping times are<br/>
&gt; usually 80-130 ms.  I have *no* trouble twisting three songs,<br/>
&gt; and if I really try hard I can do four maybe every other<br/>
&gt; round.  But once the spells start flying, it&#39;s three if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; lucky, usually two.  I&#39;m running at 1024x768 which probably<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t help, but I don&#39;t want to give up the high resolution.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well that was what I gathered that you had a low ping time(cable modem)<br/>
and had no trouble twisting three songs.  I did party with you remember<br/>
=).  But the biggest overridding difference between the two of us is the<br/>
fact that you are runnin in 1024x768 and I am in 640x480.  I am also<br/>
presuming that you are using glide and not DirectX for your card.  Glide<br/>
is much better for the Voodoo line of cards.  In this case the only<br/>
solution may be to get a faster processor and a better video card =).  Me<br/>
I humbly play at 640x480, just couldn&#39;t stand the way your inventory<br/>
screen was not full screen when I ran at 800x600.<br/>
