<b>Subject:</b> Jewelry - what are you wearing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-955499380">This has been covered before to some degree, but I was hoping to start a<br/>
thread on what jewelry people believe to be the best for Bards.  I have a<br/>
message to this list originally by Ryan Honeyman (Harmonic) that I printed<br/>
out back early September and that has yellowed with age near my computer.<br/>
In it he describes what he feels to be the best jewelry setup for Bards.<br/>
After taking a hard look at the comprehensive jewelry table at<br/>
www.castersrealm.com I found that I couldn&#39;t disagree with him.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose a bard that thought he/she was a tank would make vastly different<br/>
selections, and to be honest the jeweler thought I was nuts having her make<br/>
this setup.  She didn&#39;t even know that there *was* a Gold Star Ruby ring.<br/>
<br/>
I have the setup described below and am very pleased with it, but was<br/>
wondering what others differing viewpoint on the subject was, and if better<br/>
jewelry is perhaps available in dungeons that I should consider.<br/>
<br/>
My current stats in mostly Lambent are:<br/>
<br/>
STR 106<br/>
STA 75<br/>
AGI 104<br/>
DEX 138<br/>
WIS 60<br/>
INT 79<br/>
CHA 121<br/>

I have looked over all the jewellery that an enchanter can make.<br/>
I also realize there are earrings, rings, etc available to higher<br/>
level players from dungeons.  This is my take on the best player<br/>
made jewellery in the game for a bard, and what I currently wear.<br/>
<br/>
face:    platinum star ruby veil, cha9 dex9<br/>
neck:    golden black pearl choker, agi7 dex7<br/>
ear:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>
ear:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>
finger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>
finger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>
<br/>
most bards, have a good charisma and strength base to start<br/>
dex is extremely important, and agility is to some extent.<br/>
intellegence and wisdom are completely useless in day to day<br/>
bardic activities, although I have wis/int gear for trade skills.<br/>
<br/>
this combo gives, dex30, agi7, int4, str8, cha19<br/>
and this is the best you can get player made, best in the game imo.<br/>
<br/>
couple this with elfhide gloves, ac4, dex5, agi5  (brd rog only)<br/>
and troll hide belt, ac5, str5, sta5 (brd rog only)<br/>
<br/>
you have a extremely well balanced bard, statistically speaking.<br/>
