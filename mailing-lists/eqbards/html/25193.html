<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762288146">I have a tambourine already - main point is I have a friend who got the drum<br/>
and will give it me at a 50 pct discount of the &quot;going&quot; rate.  I want to see<br/>
that she s fairly compensated - as long as it is &quot;within my budget&quot; if you<br/>
know what I mean!<br/>
<br/>
BTW - you didn&#39;t sign it - so I&#39;m not sure what server you on.  I no longer<br/>
have access to eqprices - (I&#39;m too cheap to pay them for it!) is that 3K for<br/>
Xegony?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 I did some testing on this.  Chant of battle at 51 is 30 str and dex with a<br/>
hand drum.<br/>
With Nostolo tamborine it is 37 str and dex<br/>
With Walrus skin drum it is 39 str and dex<br/>
Guess that makes it about even with sharksin drum and on eq prices that is<br/>
around 3k.  But for the money, I think it would be cheaper to just buy your<br/>
tamborine quest coins and get that.  Better graphic too.</div>
