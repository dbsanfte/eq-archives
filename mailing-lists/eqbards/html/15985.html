<div id="ygrps-yiv-384775476">Over time I have found in an all instrument attack this combo:<br/>
<br/>
DDD<br/>
CoD<br/>
Largos Binding,<br/>
Hymn<br/>
<br/>
keeps you more ahead of the game than swapping Purifying Rhythms for Hymn,<br/>
even when you keep the three instrument swap going.<br/>
<br/>
I also found that having a passing Necromancer cast &quot;Dead Man Floating&quot; on<br/>
you, giving you 99 poison resist for a LONG time, makes the task nearly<br/>
trivial *laughs* I thanked him with the Tier&#39;Dal blessing &quot;May you grow old<br/>
and bitter&quot; and spent the rest of the night running off the top of mountains<br/>
looking for Crags and feeling like a big cheater, however the net exp gain<br/>
for the evening (a novelty since returning to EQ) helped get me past my<br/>
guilt.<br/>
