<div id="ygrps-yiv-961040644">Ah the benfits of a regular group you can trust...<br/>
<br/>
When the wizard or I (cleric) get agroed in our group, we simply hit our<br/>
&quot;Incoming&quot; hotkey, and back away from the fight (taking the agroed<br/>
mob(s) with us).  THe other caster will pop up from medding, and root<br/>
them away from the fight.  THis is a really good thing.<br/>
<br/>
With certain pulls, the wizard will whack the second mob (usually the<br/>
hardest melee hitter, assuming at least one caster in the group) and<br/>
draw him away from the battle, I will then root him, saving me a good<br/>
deal of healing mana.  We have never had a death doing this, even when<br/>
we get multiple resists.  At higher levels this may not be as viable<br/>
(since the wiz has to take a round or two of beatings), but for now its<br/>
great.  <br/>
<br/>
We are working on expanding this idea, and getting the bard to do it<br/>
(thus more damage absorbtion power, plus she has no trouble taunting the<br/>
extras off the warrior).  This would give us two rooters also, in case<br/>
things go bad...<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
