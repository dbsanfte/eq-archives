<div id="ygrps-yiv-537685581">Where do I get it from and how hard is it to get for a 32 bard??<br/>
<br/>
Also can I just confirm it&#39;s resist bonuses, is it +10 or +20 and to what<br/>
resists does it effect??<br/>
<br/>
I am using a Dragoon Dirk in my Range slot at the moment but it&#39;s nice to<br/>
have a choice of resists depending on situations.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
