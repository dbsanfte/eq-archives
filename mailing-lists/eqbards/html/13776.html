<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371592467">*Grin* I have on occasion asked a Paladin/Warrior NOT to taunt (use<br/>
one of their specials) for a while. To spread the damage out over<br/>
all in the party. And we have had our Shadowknight back out of the fight<br/>
entirely so that he will aggro more firmly on me and spread out damage more.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I can see asking a warrior not to use his extra attacks for part<br/>
of a fight, if it makes the whole more efficient.<br/>

&gt;Another point on the idea of backing off or waiting to nuke in the case of<br/>
&gt;casters.  Because they have limited mana, if a caster nukes in the first<br/>
&gt;half of a fight or the second half of the fight it doesn&#39;t matter they do<br/>
&gt;the same damage and are just as effective damage-wise either way.  They<br/>
&gt;would be wasting mana if they nuked constantly anyhow.  If a bard doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;sing for half the fight its a huge hit to their effectiveness, since there<br/>
&gt;is no wasting of mana to deal with.  Would anyone seriously ever suggest a<br/>
&gt;ranger only dual-wield for part of a fight?  Or that a warrior not use his<br/>
&gt;extra attacks for part of a fight?  Of course not.  The main reason to have<br/>
&gt;nukers wait is because they have limited mana anyhow and they will avoid<br/>
&gt;getting hurt and still do just as much damage by waiting.  Bards<br/>
&gt;do not have<br/>
&gt;this luxury.<br/>
