<div id="ygrps-yiv-453036305">IMHO binding should be available thru NPC&#39;s in cities.  Preferable one in<br/>
each zone if the city is more than one zone.  Charge a hefty fee i.e. 5pp,<br/>
the most I have evern seen a caster charge was 2pp, so at 5pp, people will<br/>
still seek out a caster to do it, however if casters aren&#39;t available you<br/>
can still get bound.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think they should be available in some of the inns that are out in<br/>
desolute zones, if Brad wants us to go out and explore these &quot;empty&quot; zones,<br/>
he has to offer us some cozy feelings about going there.  I think the Arena<br/>
needs a NPC binder, as well as HHK, I also think that maybe some of the<br/>
zones near good cities should have evil NPC&#39;s who will only bind evil<br/>
characters.  And maybe even double as a bank.<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few ideas I think that would get people moving around the<br/>
continents a little more.  The bank idea may be dumb come to think of it, as<br/>
it would assist the campers, they wouldn&#39;t have as far a run to deposit<br/>
their loot.<br/>

&gt; No I think you&#39;d find people of more appropriate level there, and half the<br/>
&gt; people in BlackBurrow would be there too since there are plenty of low<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; gnolls there.  In general it is binding more than anything that is keeping<br/>
&gt; people from spreading out the way Brad wants them too.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; uninteresting treasure, they just go get that when they know they can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; die<br/>
&gt; there, then complain because it is trivial to them at that level.  Binding<br/>
&gt; keeps people close to cites, try playing at a non-prime time like I do<br/>
&gt; many<br/>
&gt; times when there are only 600 people on-line.  getting bound anywhere<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; just a pain, its often impossible.  I was unable to find anyone even<br/>
&gt; capable<br/>
&gt; of binding on all of faydwyr one morning, and so packed it in since a 40<br/>
&gt; minute boat trip to recover a corpse is ridiculous.  this is my one and<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; real peeve with EQ, binding is given out as a &#39;skill&#39;, when in reality<br/>
&gt; without adventuring can become ridiculously difficult, simply because<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; are not enough people playing.  That is unacceptable.<br/>

&gt; I agree with you that it is a matter of balance, but I think it should go<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; other way. I think casters should only be able to bind themselves to<br/>
&gt; cities.<br/>
&gt; If<br/>
&gt; everyone could be bound anywhere there&#39;d be no reward for risking trips to<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; of the way places (like Guk). I routinely spend time in Splitpaw dungeon<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; is about a 20-25 minute walk from the nearest bind point. But because of<br/>
&gt; this it<br/>
&gt; is rare to see more than 10 people in there. If anyone could be bound<br/>
&gt; right<br/>
&gt; outside the entrance it would be just like Blackburrow, Crushbone, et.al.<br/>

&gt; &gt; SoW doesn&#39;t affect what your character can do, other than kiting, only<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; long it takes.  Bind definitely affects where you can adventure.  Ever<br/>
&gt; seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone in Upper Guk who the mobs weren&#39;t all green to?  You can bet they<br/>
&gt; &gt; were either an evil race or a caster.  Its a five zone run for any<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-caster good race, far too dangerous, untill nearly everything in Guk<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; green to you.  Believe me I will never play another character who does<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; get bind, period.  It is way too limiting.  I left Erudin with very<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; exploration because there was literally no one there who could bind me,<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the city!  I&#39;ve likewise had to wait over an hour just to get bound<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kaladim because there was no one around who could bind me.  Of course<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; been a caster I was certainly high enough, 14th level to bind myself<br/>
&gt; both<br/>
&gt; &gt; times.  I went to Guk, looked around and left.  Its too far to run when<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything around will cause a train and give no xp, except for a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; critters in the interior who are red.  If I was even a 12th level mage<br/>
&gt; type<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would have stayed since the run would be measured in seconds, not half<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours.  Pure and simple, on average one death in Guk would take up my<br/>
&gt; entire<br/>
&gt; &gt; evening of gaming and as a bard I run as fast as anyone.  That is an<br/>
&gt; &gt; imbalance, not a class distinction.<br/>
