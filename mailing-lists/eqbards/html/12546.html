<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587135438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No disrespect Harmonic, but what is it about level 50 that makes players so<br/>

  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I never went on dragon raids when I was younger, and for a reason.<br/>
  I&#39;ve already stated that reason.  Now, I&#39;ve waited to do this and<br/>
  I see why it&#39;s important to do so.  We will not be taking anyone<br/>
  less than L49 on any further raids, you have to play elite to beat<br/>
  a more elite opponent.  I&#39;m sorry you felt downplayed.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Harmonic, don&#39;t forget that although the songs at higher levels have<br/>
&gt; improved, our percussion skills are already maxxed at 41.  Our party buffing<br/>
&gt; abilities (other than perhaps by new songs) aren&#39;t going to improve.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Then you don&#39;t understand your songs well enough.  At L50 a bard<br/>
  can produce 9 more MR/CR/FR with elemental than a L41 bard, regardless<br/>
  of precussion skill.<br/>

  You are assuming I&#39;m a complete idiot when it comes to lag.  Let<br/>
  me help you out here... There is visual lag (all the crap you are<br/>
  stating) and there is server lag.  The location server cannot keep<br/>
  pace with 50 or 60 people standing in one place.  It never has,<br/>
  even in beta.  Verant simply hasn&#39;t designed the game to accomodate<br/>
  that.  I do not get visual lag.  I get server lag.  In fact, to<br/>
  the point where I completely crash.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Reduce resolution if applicable.  I normally play at 1024x768 on a TNT2<br/>
&gt; Ultra, but reduce to 800x600 for dragons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I have a Diamond V770 TNT2 Ultra, at 640 x 480.  and???  heh<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh, but you&#39;ve opened yourself up here<br/>
  based on your semi-limited knowledge of myself and my computer<br/>
  and my tactics.  Sorry I wasn&#39;t more clear in the beginning.<br/>
  You&#39;ve stated nothing new to me here.<br/>
