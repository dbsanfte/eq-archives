<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081312905">Elwyn: Where, oh where are our missings songs?!  Several of our songs<br/>
(levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the game.  We would like to know<br/>
when we can expect these to be implemented.  If they are indeed in the game<br/>
already perhaps discovered via quests) please at least let us know that they<br/>
exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to get them, or even what they are,<br/>
but we don&#39;t want to waste our time questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
We&#39;ve been without these songs (whatever they are) since day one of release,<br/>
and its become a point of serious aggravation for us.<br/>
<br/>
GZ: This missing songs are being saved for the expansion pack.  We might<br/>
break down and put some of them in sooner, but I really wanted to be able to<br/>
add new abilities to Bards as the game contintued.<br/>
lol.<br/>
<br/>
I really have to take issue with this. It is an expansion pack. For levels<br/>
OVER 50. Sure i may never even get to those levels..BUT they should be in<br/>
game now. Whats gonna happen when the expansion pack comes out? We dont get<br/>
any new songs for over 50 cause they filled in our missing songs from below<br/>
50? *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
And the excuse about the graphics patch being too big that people dont wanna<br/>
patch it is moot now that there is the optional patch...fix our<br/>
graphics...hell they stopped us from surfing now when we play selo&#39;s(i<br/>
really liked that) so it must not be too hard to fix animations.<br/>
