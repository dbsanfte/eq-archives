<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  If it worked, I would use it more often.  heh.  <br/>
<br/>
  That was when we did PoF, and I was bound to Oggok.  I&#39;d die and<br/>
  immediately try to hide jic.  I switch hide and sneak around as I <br/>
  need them.  I have all 6 banks full of hotkeys, so I am totally out <br/>
  of space.<br/>
<br/>
  Don&#39;t use hide much at all, unless I&#39;m next to a door in a newbie<br/>
  area and I want to mess with people&#39;s minds.<br/>
<br/>
  Very perceptive, nice catch.<br/>
