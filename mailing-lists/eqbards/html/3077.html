<div id="ygrps-yiv-437866257">&lt;I spend a ridiculously high percentage of my waking hours with my hand on a<br/>
mouse, either for work or leisure.  I twist two songs pretty easily by<br/>
having the ones I want to twist on hot buttons, next to each other.  I only<br/>
have to shift the mouse a little, onto the button for the next song, click<br/>
to stop current song, click to start next one.  Shift, wait a bit, click,<br/>
click.  Repeat.&gt;<br/>
Gaaah!  You use the mouse during battle?  :::feels feint:::  With my crappy<br/>
connection, the only way I can twist 3 songs is by using the keyboard.  I<br/>
put my most-used songs in the hot-keys, hit auto-attack, and join in<br/>
(usually pulling the creatures onto ME until the mage fires off a nuke or<br/>
2).  For movement, I use the keypad (So simple to put most things there)  I<br/>
have Con located on the 0, Jump on the *, and auto-attack on +  (all on the<br/>
keypad side)  Can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s EQ design or my own, but auto-run is on<br/>
the Number Lock button.  That way I go from one movement button button to<br/>
the other with very little movement.<br/>
  Also, just dl&#39;d Roger Wilco nad have used it ingame while grouping with<br/>
other people in my guild that have it... WOW!  It makes SUCH a difference!<br/>
Voice communication while in-game, that doesn&#39;t take away from CPU-usage<br/>
that any of us have been able to notice.  I can&#39;t recommend it enough.<br/>
