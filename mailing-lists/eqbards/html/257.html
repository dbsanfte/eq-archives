<b>Subject:</b> Kelin&#39;s Lullaby <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-198855794">Yesterday I got the song Kelin&#39;s Lucyd Lullaby in Kelethin. I&#39;ve heard<br/>
several times that this is one of the most powerful bard songs and I was really<br/>
looking forward to get it. But now i have to admit that i am quite<br/>
disapponited. I thought that it should stop monsters attacking you, and this seems to<br/>
be true, but after a few seconds they start attacking you again. I&#39;ve read<br/>
in this newsgroup that the song makes monsters forget you so they wont<br/>
attack you any more when you go away, but that doesnt seem to be true. In fact<br/>
EVERY monster in a certain area around you will attack after a while when you<br/>
are singing the song. So if you are in real trouble and want to get rid of<br/>
that nasty monster attacking you, you just start singing that song and 10<br/>
seconds later EVRY living being near you will start attacking you. I really<br/>
dont know why this song is called to be one of the most powerful ones...<br/>
If i am wrong please tell me, I would really appreciate.<br/>
