&gt;&gt; *sigh* *small voice* Two levels in two hours?<br/>
&gt;&gt; My baby bard went from level 5 to level 7 last night...<br/>
&gt;&gt; But it took me from 10:30p to 4am... How did you do it<br/>
&gt;&gt; so FAST?...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  4am?!?!  Holy smokes, Fae.. how do you manage to do anything<br/>
&gt;  during the day?  I thought I was bad for staying up to 1am.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t MEAN to stay that late... but it suddenly occurred to<br/>
me I could make 7 if I stayed &quot;just a little bit longer&quot; --<br/>
Which ended up taking much longer than I thought... I should<br/>
know better. You&#39;d think after all the times I tell others<br/>
I level slowly, that I would believe it by now.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I recreated Faesong on Solusek Ro... SHe got up to 2 bubbles from 17<br/>
on Test when I realized where my true friends were. So I created her<br/>
(as a Half Elf, not Wood Elf, so she could be half Inky) on Sol Ro. It&#39;s<br/>
going to take me a bit to get back there. I&#39;m sorry :( ...But I<br/>
have to be where my friends are... EVen if I can&#39;t group with them<br/>
except for when they decide to play their secondaries. I still want<br/>
to be where we can at least /tell!<br/>
