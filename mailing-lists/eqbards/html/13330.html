<br/>
*Announcements*<br/>
<br/>
The Plane of Sky is now open!!!  As a reminder to our customers, the<br/>
alternate planes of reality do not necessarily follow the same physical or<br/>
ethereal rules as Norrath proper.  Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
Today is patch day! The EverQuest servers have been patched with the<br/>
following changes:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*General Changes / Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- Some changes have been made to the exit of Nagafen&#39;s Lair into the<br/>
Lavastorm Mountains.  This will hopefully reduce if not solve the bug that<br/>
causes people to fall into lava when exiting Nagafen&#39;s Lair.  Please let<br/>
us know how this goes.<br/>
<br/>
- Due to feedback received from the customers concerning the density of<br/>
fog during rainstorms, visibility has been increased.<br/>
<br/>
- All drops of steel weapons have been replaced with higher quality<br/>
fine-steel weapons of the same type.  This change was made to reduce the<br/>
amount of new currency coming into the world at the mid-to-upper levels.<br/>
The fine-steel weapons are in all cases superior to the steel weapons that<br/>
were dropping, they just sell to vendors for less money.<br/>
<br/>
- Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items.   This<br/>
was done to correct issues that could arise from people chain-casting<br/>
these items. <br/>
<br/>
- The safe-point (the point which you return if you fall below the world)<br/>
in Kithicor has been moved near the entrance to Rivervale, a safer part of<br/>
the zone.<br/>
<br/>
- Corrected a bug that caused AC to be improperly displayed for higher<br/>
level<br/>
  characters.  Your AC should now reflect all of your items.<br/>
<br/>
Additional Bug Fixes:<br/>
<br/>
- Corrected a bug in the client that could cause a crash if you were<br/>
spammed with emotes by someone on your /ignore list.<br/>
- Corrected a bug that allowed ships to move faster when disarmed<br/>
- Corrected a bug that caused the Aqualung to lose its charges if dropped<br/>
on the ground.<br/>
- Fire Giants in Nagafen&#39;s Lair should now recover properly when stuck in<br/>
lava.  Consider yourself warned.<br/>
- The Instill Doubt skill has been disabled on the PvP servers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Changes*<br/>
<br/>
- Shadow Vortex is now a &quot;drain&quot; spell.<br/>
- Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs<br/>
- Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced.  In addition,<br/>
the spell is less resistable.<br/>
- Angstlich&#39;s Appalling Screech had its radius increased slightly.<br/>
- All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius slightly<br/>
increased<br/>
- Yonder will now interact better with levitate.<br/>
- Form of the Great Wolf had its speed component increased.<br/>
- Terrorize Animal had its casting time reduced and is less resistable.<br/>
- New magician&#39;s spells have been added.  Check your spell vendors.<br/>
- Reoccurring Amnesia has been made more effective.<br/>
- NPCs will now treat the &quot;Cancel Magic&quot; series of spells as hostile.<br/>
Previously, NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their buffs<br/>
before attacking.  Now they will.<br/>
- The Fear and Charm series of spells now properly notify the caster when<br/>
they break.  No, seriously, we&#39;re certain this time. <br/>
- Harmtouch now does more damage beginning at level 41.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Levitation Changed*<br/>
<br/>
Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items, the code<br/>
that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while it was active is<br/>
no longer necessary and has been backed out.  The Levitate spell may now<br/>
be refreshed while the spell is in use.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Quests and Items*<br/>
<br/>
- The Armor of Ro should be more obtainable.  We will continue to evaluate<br/>
and adjust the rarity of other class-specific armor components to make the<br/>
pieces obtainable in a reasonable amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
- We have changed the reward of a newbie quest in the Qeynos area from a<br/>
level 49 scroll to a level 1 scroll.  The issuance of a level 49 scroll<br/>
was a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters to amass an<br/>
abnormally large amount of currency. <br/>
<br/>
- The stats on the reward for the Rogue Redemption quest have been<br/>
increased to make it better than the favorite dropped-weapon for the level<br/>
range.<br/>
<br/>
- Ravenscale boots will now drop as frequently as other Ravenscale items.<br/>
<br/>
- The Mask of Deception may now be equipped by the appropriate races.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Fletching Update*<br/>
<br/>
All arrows created with the new Silver-Tipped Arrowhead (formerly the<br/>
Bladed Arrowhead) are now magical in nature, and may be used versus<br/>
magical creatures.  All existing items in your possession will<br/>
automatically morph into the new magical items.  Additionally, each<br/>
successful attempt to create magical arrows will yield 10 arrows instead<br/>
of the previous 5.  As such, the vendor buy-back value has been decreased<br/>
accordingly.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Paw*<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty of Paw has been decreased.  We found that many of the<br/>
gnolls in the new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the dungeon more<br/>
difficult than it should have been for the desired level target.  Please<br/>
let us know how this change affects the viability of the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*The Plane of Fear*<br/>
<br/>
The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear have been increased.  This<br/>
change was supposed to have occurred in the last patch, however the data<br/>
was not exported.  It has been tested and equipment drops are now<br/>
occurring at a much higher rate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*The Plane of Hate*<br/>
<br/>
The item-drop percentages on roaming and fast-spawning NPCs in the Plane<br/>
of Hate have been decreased.  Previously, these NPCs used the same<br/>
drop-percentages as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing overall drop<br/>
percentages to be extremely high.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no longer fall for illusions,<br/>
and tend to &quot;Hate&quot; everyone. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Monk Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
A monk&#39;s speed in hand-to-hand combat will now improve with level,<br/>
beginning in the high 20s. This will result in higher level monks doing<br/>
substantially more damage in a given time-frame.  <br/>
<br/>
Though this change does increase the power of the average monk, it should<br/>
be stressed that the monk is now even more in need of true tank classes<br/>
who have the ability to taunt upset creatures off them. We want to stress<br/>
that the &quot;taunt factor&quot; of a monks fist has NOT been increased, though it<br/>
may appear so due to your increased damage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Paladin/Shadowknight Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
Paladins and Shadowknights now have a higher hitpoints and higher skill<br/>
caps on Bash and Taunt.<br/>
<br/>
The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins and SKs over<br/>
level 25.  This was done because the Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the<br/>
same HP base, which upon further consideration is not compatible with our<br/>
vision of those classes&#39; roles.  This change will basically put Paladin<br/>
and SK HPs midway (in terms of Hit Points) between rangers and warriors of<br/>
the same race. <br/>
<br/>
The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular, Paladins had<br/>
difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors<br/>
due to their lower damage output.  Though the Paladin and SK will never<br/>
equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition to<br/>
some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks. <br/>
<br/>
Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren&#39;t switching to<br/>
two-handed weapons, choosing instead to continue using the bash skill.<br/>
Most warriors, being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most part, do<br/>
not worry about bash and instead opt for slam, which uses the same skill.<br/>
Paladins are typically the only characters who use a shield throughout<br/>
their lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Rogue Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
Whenever a rogue is invisible, whether by spell, potion, or skill, they<br/>
are now also invisible to undead.  <br/>
<br/>
This change was made to add a definite class-advantage to the rogue,<br/>
allowing them to do something that no other class could do.  It is the<br/>
first step in a multi-step process to improve the rogue class. <br/>
<br/>
*Wizard Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic, Cold, or<br/>
Fire) much less likely to be resisted.  This effect stacks with the Staff<br/>
of Temperate Flux and enchanter, shaman, and magician resistance debuffs.<br/>
<br/>
This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards at about the<br/>
level that all spell-casting classes start seeing their resistance rates<br/>
go up.  Wizards specialize in direct magical damage. It makes sense that<br/>
they should be better at causing that damage than the other classes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Bard Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
Bards will now receive the Meditate skill at 10th level.  This skill will<br/>
be granted automatically the first time a bard zones after reaching 10th<br/>
level, and cannot be trained further.  It will have the effect of<br/>
decreasing the amount of time that it takes a Bard to memorize their<br/>
songs.  Previously, it would take 50th level bards upwards of 2 minutes to<br/>
memorize a song.  Now it is much faster.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Druid Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
The skill cap on a Druid&#39;s tracking skill has been increased.  This change<br/>
was implemented based upon general public opinion that the former cap was<br/>
far too low for the skill to be even marginally viable.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Feign Death and Pets*<br/>
<br/>
After a serious discussion regarding the Necromancer&#39;s Feign Death tactic,<br/>
as well as reviewing public opinion on the matter, we have implemented a<br/>
change.  As we would like everyone to understand why we feel this change<br/>
was necessary, here is a summary of the issue:<br/>
<br/>
Problem: <br/>
Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances,<br/>
providing offensive tactics that are abusive.  For this ability to remain<br/>
balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as invisibility.  Offensive<br/>
tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting a saving throw<br/>
verses the effect.  Since creatures do NOT get a direct save verses feign<br/>
death (as you cast it on yourself), and since you can retry the combat<br/>
once you have feigned death, there is very little risk to necromancer<br/>
himself.  As this tactic involves charming an NPC and turning it against<br/>
another NPC, which could be part of the same spawn, it allows for<br/>
Necromancers to solo MUCH bigger rooms than any other class could.  This<br/>
situation is well beyond what would preserve game balance for any other<br/>
class (soloing the Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for<br/>
example). <br/>
<br/>
Example: <br/>
While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death tactic is<br/>
abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of Lower<br/>
Guk.  The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord himself.<br/>
Using the current system, a level 50 Necro can easily solo the room at<br/>
virtually no risk to himself. The Necro can get into the room quite easily<br/>
with Invis To Undead.  To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one<br/>
Bok and Charms the other.  When the Ghoul Lord rushes him, he feigns.  The<br/>
Lord then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking considerable<br/>
damage during the fight.  The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul Lord<br/>
returns to its spawn point.  When the necromancer gets back  up, he is in<br/>
no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign Death works now. He then<br/>
charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns again.  The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is<br/>
killed.  When the Necromancer gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul<br/>
Lord AND nearly full mana.  The Lord is now an easy kill, and the Necro<br/>
collects his special items.<br/>
<br/>
Solution: <br/>
Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<br/>
suicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<br/>
adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we<br/>
do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necro&#39;s from exploiting<br/>
key spawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will<br/>
immediately break Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will NOT be<br/>
affected.  While this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with<br/>
your summoned pet, it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns<br/>
to the degree that charming an NPC does. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Manastone Changed*<br/>
<br/>
The players have raised many concerns about the power of the Manastone,<br/>
which no longer drops.  They cite that people without a Manastone are not<br/>
as welcome in expeditions to the outer planes and other areas as people<br/>
with them.  Since dropping additional Manastones via quest or removing<br/>
them from the existing populace is not desirable, we&#39;ve decided to make it<br/>
so that the Manastone will no longer function in the alternate planes.<br/>
Furthermore, it will not function in any of the zones included with the<br/>
Kunark Expansion.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize to those adversely affected by this change. Our general goal<br/>
is to avoid making changes to items in peoples&#39; possession, however we<br/>
felt this change was, all things considered, warranted and for the benefit<br/>
of the game as a whole.<br/>
