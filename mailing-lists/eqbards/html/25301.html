<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511884857">getting into every possible raid is certainly the way to go.  On Rodcet Nife, most dragon raids are closed unless the guild holding the raid is too high to field a decent team.  Then the first scale/book whatever is reserved.  Still, these raids are a great opportunity to meet solid players that you need not fear grouping with.  (at 52 I avoid pickup groups as much as possible -- a bad one will get you killed and Rezzes aren&#39;t always available)<br/>
<br/>
Also, as you hit dragon raid age -- if you do dragon raids -- your needs will change.  Weapons are secondary to a good drum and lute and resists start to mean a whole lot more.  Poison, especially, if you are hitting Temple of Veeshan is a good idea.  Velious and kunark dragons have this bad habit of inflicting horrendous dots on your party.  Disenchanting melody can help quite a bit when that happens.  <br/>
<br/>
My advice to any bard that plans on doing dragon raids, go to EW and do the ulthork tusk quest to start getting gems for resist jewelry.  even if you don&#39;t get a blue diamond out of it, you are building a cash reserve to start getting resist gear.  <br/>

My advice is still to try and get into Ragefire camps for red scales and<br/>
watch for Gore as much as possible. If you can get into a Vox/Naggy raid,<br/>
do it. It will probably take you several levels before you have all the<br/>
pieces. Helping people with Gore/Vox/Nag/Trak/Rage gets your name known<br/>
and brownie points built. You will need them if you spot Vox up and when<br/>
you get ready to spawn Trak for your last step. My guild has some Vox<br/>
level toons and we need a frost book for one of our main paladins. If you<br/>
spot her up one night, give me a tell and we will see who&nbsp; we have<br/>
that can come help.<br/>
