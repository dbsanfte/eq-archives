<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460322058">Just some personal observations as I upgraded:<br/>
<br/>
64 MB RAM -&gt; 128 MB RAM decreased my zoning times from about 2.5 minutes<br/>
down to just over 1 minute.<br/>
<br/>
Increasing Video RAM from 4mb AGP ATi to 32mb AGP ASUS GeForce increased my<br/>
playability from 3 songs on a good night to 4 songs easily.<br/>
<br/>
Going from a 33UDMA 5400RPM Hard Drive to a 66UDMA 7200RPM Hard Drive<br/>
decreased my zone times from just over 1 minute to just under 1 minute.<br/>
<br/>
Going from a PII-300 to a PIII-600 decreased my zoning times from just under<br/>
1 minute to approximately 20 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the reference (believe you can find it on<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">http://eq.castersrealm.com</a> archives), Brad mentioned that he used 128 MB on<br/>
his machine, then upgraded to 256 MB for Kunark Testing.  He also hinted<br/>
that this was &#39;optimal&#39; for running the Kunark expansion.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest dumping a couple of hundred dollars in RAM before upgrading<br/>
just about anything else.  (I build these things for a living...more RAM<br/>
always helps the equations)<br/>
<br/>
Note: Windows 95/98 does not use RAM effectively above 128MB.  If you do a<br/>
performance analysis, there is a large dropoff at the 128MB mark.  Win2K (I<br/>
haven&#39;t done an analysis yet, so this is hearsay) should be able to use up<br/>
to 1 GB of RAM effectively, assuming your processor/bios/motherboard is up<br/>
to the task.  Incidentally, I don&#39;t use anything but Intel chips in<br/>
machines, because every AMD I&#39;ve tested has problems of one sort or another,<br/>
and I stress the dog out of every processor I own.  I don&#39;t believe the AMD<br/>
chips are bad, but the motherboard chipset support seems lacking.  This is<br/>
probably changing as we speak, as AMD needs to be a bit more stable than<br/>
Intel, since they are selling alot of chips to the &#39;I&#39;ve never used one of<br/>
these things before...&#39; market.  I&#39;ll continue to test AMD chipsets in the<br/>
near future, and maybe I&#39;ll be happy with stability soon...maybe not.<br/>

&gt; Heh yep if that&#39;s a 3d NOW system then it&#39;s more than likely your RAM.<br/>
I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; also consider the video card but the 3DNOW should take care of any<br/>
&gt; insufficiencies in the display adaptor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go to 128mb of RAM and you&#39;ll notice a pretty dramatic improvement.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  But is that really a K3? Like before<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the K5/K6? I didnt think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they HAD a K3 400.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;It is a K6 III 400 3D NOW processor. Sorry for the typo;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Heh, then it is almost definitely your RAM.<br/>
