<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760851264">Even though bards don&#39;t have &#39;meditate&#39; skill, I have noticed that clicking<br/>
on the meditate button while memming songs makes it go a tad bit faster - do<br/>
you all do this too?  Not fast like a caster but faster than not doing it.<br/>
Some songs I click several or more times.  Same thing in scribing a new song<br/>
- click the meditate button.<br/>

If they wanted us to be able to mem songs faster they could just give us<br/>
meditate with a really low skill cap (like 1).  As far as I can tell, my<br/>
meditate skill has nothing to with the speed at which I mem spells (only<br/>
that when I have meditate its ALOT faster)</div>
