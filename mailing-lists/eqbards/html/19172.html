<div id="ygrps-yiv-637758231">Few tips:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Do not group with him<br/>
2)  Charm him and make him attack his pet (he can&#39;t cast spells at all, pet<br/>
may even kill him before charm wears off)<br/>
3)  Rinse and repeat<br/>
<br/>
Then for variety, run off with his pet in hot pursuit, chain pet then run<br/>
back.  Pet will get lost because it&#39;s so far away from him.  Kill him when<br/>
you get back, he can&#39;t make a new pet so he&#39;s even more helpless than a<br/>
wizzie.  When he dies pet goes poof.<br/>

&gt; I have dueled a mage once before.  I lost, but I learned something.<br/>
&gt; 1)  You can&#39;t charm the pet.  2)  You can&#39;t charm people you are<br/>
&gt; grouped with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There was a bug where I tried charming the pet and it didn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt; But once he killed me, his pet went berserk and attacked him... he<br/>
&gt; almost died.  I say, get him back for your guild mates.  Charm HIM<br/>
&gt; into attacking his pet.  Let his pet kill him and he will lose exp<br/>
&gt; ;)  He will love that!<br/>

&gt; &gt; A magician in my guild has been bragging for several<br/>
&gt; &gt; days now about how great he is.  He&#39;s dueled several<br/>
&gt; &gt; players in my guild that are 2-3 lvls higher and<br/>
&gt; &gt; defeated them (one was killed by his pet;-( )<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway as I approach 30th lvl I expect to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenged by this guy and, since his attitude really<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets me going anyway, *really* don&#39;t want to lose...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have never dueled...I am more into the group and<br/>
&gt; &gt; make friends aspect of this game.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So far I figure pixie strike, song of siriens guardian<br/>
&gt; &gt; and elemental rythmns will be my main songs....weapons<br/>
&gt; &gt; are a T claw and gnoll hide lariet.  (I also have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; silvery axe but figure stunning is a good thing with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; caster....)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?<br/>
