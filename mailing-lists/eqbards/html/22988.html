<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605336297">You would also think that they test stuff or at least listen to the folks<br/>
who do. Well, not if you have been playing EQ for very long - they dont test<br/>
well at all - who knows why - never have - maybe never will. <br/>
<br/>
This whole Selos problem *was reported one the Test server*! Way before the<br/>
recent patch.  It was a reported problem on Test.<br/>

I recall that everytime they tinker with snare/root, Selos breaks. You&#39;d<br/>
think someone somewhere would have a Sticky note: check bard speed when<br/>
changing root/snare!<br/>
