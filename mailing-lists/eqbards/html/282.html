<div id="ygrps-yiv-944870270">I totally agree with you Olczyk. I awoke today to find 55 new mesages <br/>
in my mail and not even 1/4 of them are what this is suppose to be <br/>
used for. If you have a problem with someones guild or how they are <br/>
playing the game Stop following them around and do what you want. <br/>
This is meant to be fun and some people want to do it differently <br/>
then others. Hell if there is a guild out there that i really like <br/>
and have fun with i could care less about paying 100 pp to get into <br/>
it. This is what you make of it. I am a 14th lvl Bard and currently <br/>
working on blacksmithing in my free time. I am doing this to get the <br/>
prized armor and hopefully make alot of loot. But i do plan on <br/>
starting a guild and probly will charge ??(alot) to get into it. The <br/>
reason being is that i will make banded for anyone in my guild at <br/>
cost.  Does that sound like a bad thing?? Just curious why so many <br/>
people complain about pp&#39;s to join guilds.<br/>
<br/>
Also for some of you having problems finding some of the songs,(i <br/>
wont say which ones cause i dont like to spoil anything in this game <br/>
for anyone else) there are some songs on a merchant inside the <br/>
Highhold. This is quite a trip for some of you but well worth it. The <br/>
views are wonderful from the hold.<br/>
<br/>
In and around the beautiful city of Qeynos(sonyeq)is where I frequent <br/>
and if any bards would like to trade stories or just go out and <br/>
adventure or even need some help with a problem, give me a shout.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly  HAVE FUN<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>

&gt;While i am not a member of the soerbaird nor have i ever met a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>member, i still think that the opinions put forth ford and greg are <br/>
not fit to print.  this is an information source not a general gripe <br/>
board.  please let the rest of us make up out minds about people when <br/>
we meet them. i am a journalist in that other realm known as earth <br/>
and what you wrote would there be called libel.  please be civil my <br/>
brothers.  we are all here to have fun.<br/>
