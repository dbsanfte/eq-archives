&gt;With that said, everyone knows that not everything in EQ is logical.  Case<br/>
&gt;in point is the vodka recipe that is the current hot topic on the brewers<br/>
&gt;list.  People have been trying for weeks to discover this recipe.  All kinds<br/>
&gt;of logical ingredient combinations were tried.  This week the recipe was<br/>
&gt;discovered/leaked by Verant.  One of the ingredients for vodka is short<br/>
&gt;beer.  No way in hell would anyone ever think to include beer as part of a<br/>
&gt;recipe for vodka.  I&#39;m sure there are other examples out there.<br/>

&quot;The scale of operation is one where 10 kg of sugar per batch are fermented<br/>
to a crude &quot;beer&quot;<br/>
which is then distilled to yield 11 liters of 40% vodka.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that&#39;s where the idea came from...<br/>
