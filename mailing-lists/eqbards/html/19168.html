<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054273132">I have dueled a mage once before.  I lost, but I learned something.  <br/>
1)  You can&#39;t charm the pet.  2)  You can&#39;t charm people you are <br/>
grouped with.<br/>
<br/>
There was a bug where I tried charming the pet and it didn&#39;t work.  <br/>
But once he killed me, his pet went berserk and attacked him... he <br/>
almost died.  I say, get him back for your guild mates.  Charm HIM <br/>
into attacking his pet.  Let his pet kill him and he will lose exp <br/>
;)  He will love that!<br/>

&gt; A magician in my guild has been bragging for several<br/>

&gt; defeated them (one was killed by his pet;-( )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway as I approach 30th lvl I expect to be<br/>
&gt; challenged by this guy and, since his attitude really<br/>
&gt; gets me going anyway, *really* don&#39;t want to lose...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have never dueled...I am more into the group and<br/>
&gt; make friends aspect of this game.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So far I figure pixie strike, song of siriens guardian<br/>
&gt; and elemental rythmns will be my main songs....weapons<br/>
&gt; are a T claw and gnoll hide lariet.  (I also have a<br/>
&gt; silvery axe but figure stunning is a good thing with a<br/>
&gt; caster....)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions?<br/>
