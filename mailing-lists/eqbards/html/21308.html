&gt; UWOO and Anarchy Online are in the same category.  The developers from both<br/>
&gt; of those games have promised a new PvP system which will largely eliminate<br/>
&gt; grief PKers but still promote PvP (i.e. guildwars).  UWOO has guaranteed<br/>
&gt; their new system will work.  Remains to be seen though.  Also, I&#39;ve never<br/>
&gt; played UO, but from what I&#39;ve read on the UWOO mailing list, grief PKing in<br/>
&gt; UO now has been largely solved.  No idea how it was solved though.  <br/>

world where pking is not allowed at all. i.e. Adding a switch.<br/>
