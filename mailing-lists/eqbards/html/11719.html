<div id="ygrps-yiv-5236627">For the longest time I noticed that our stamina bar will slowly drop if you<br/>
start running around a lot in the same zone you logged into. As soon as you<br/>
zone it seems to correct this. Is this what you are referring to or do you<br/>
get this after you zone as well?<br/>

They seem to have fixed levitation, but I noticed that every time I<br/>
fired up Selo&#39;s and ran any distance of any sort, my fatigue bar started<br/>
to drop pretty rapidly.  I didn&#39;t make any really long runs, but if I<br/>
have to start resting now when using our speed song, it&#39;s going to<br/>
really tick me off.  Has anyone else noticed this?<br/>
