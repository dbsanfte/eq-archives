Our Epic is as strong or weaker than storebought instruments, depending on the type (I don&#39;t know offhand which is which).  It&#39;s useful to keep your 7 String as well as your Drum around for special situations, but you can probably leave your flute and horn at the bank.<br/>

p.s. This is my 3rd time sending this email (the first 2 I sent from the onelist site).  Anyone else having trouble posting from the site?<br/>

  all our best instruments or stronger in string, lesser in percussion? I&#39;m<br/>
  just trying to figure out what instruments I don&#39;t need to carry around<br/>
  anymore.<br/>
