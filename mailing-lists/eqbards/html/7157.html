640x480 so I can&#39;t put my instruments in a bag.  They (along<br/>
with weapons) take up 4 of my 8 main inventory slots.  Due to<br/>
weight concerns, I had to give up backpacks for large bags.  <br/>
I have one 6 slot weight reducing pack, one 4 slot weight<br/>
reducing pack, and two 6 slot large bags.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a total of 22 free slots in my pack.  1 slot goes to my<br/>
4th instrument, 1 slot for bandages, 1 slot for a pumice<br/>
stone, and 2 slots for food and drink.  5 slots are currently<br/>
taken by unbankable no-drops.  That leaves me just 12 slots<br/>
for loot, and I&#39;m not going to give them up for the dozen or<br/>
so different types of foraged food/drink.<br/>
<br/>
The no-drop change will help, as would a 10 slot box of<br/>
aku-bar or whatever. Another possible change (could we add it<br/>
to the petition?) would be allowing you to open containers in<br/>
non-640x480 resolutions from inventory slots on your hotkey<br/>
pad.  Then I could keep all my instruments in a bag, freeing<br/>
me to carry 4 more containers.<br/>
