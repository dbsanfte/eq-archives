<b>Subject:</b> Who is John Kim(tm) ? (was Video (WAY OT) ) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634561430">John Kim (tm) was the one of the prominent posters on this list since its<br/>
creation.  He conducted numerous tests on all of the songs.  Much of the<br/>
song data on Rokenn&#39;s song analysis was provided by John.  He stopped<br/>
posting on this list for whatever reason a couple months ago.  John was also<br/>
the bard who ran extensive tests on the Lullaby song several months ago and<br/>
posted his test results on the Whineplay forum (Kitasi ran similar tests and<br/>
included his results in the same thread).  After countless bumps, Abashi<br/>
finally acknowledged the post and stated Verant would look into the<br/>
situation.  That was before Kunark was released IIRC.  Has been several<br/>
months and several patches but still no fix to the song.<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed that a few people seem to have lamented the &#39;loss&#39; of John Kim<br/>
from the list.  Having never read any of the fellow&#39;s posts, I can only<br/>
presume that he was a prolific tester?<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve seen over the past year, Rokenn has done an outstanding job<br/>
of testing and retesting with each new patch the various effects of our<br/>
songs.  Just wanted to say that your efforts are greatly appreciated and<br/>
it&#39;s people like you that make this list what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Time consuming and job threatening! ;)  (j/k)<br/>
