<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077880370">there&#39;s only one warrior legs in existence at the moment, and he loves it.<br/>
it&#39;s just a huge bonus on top of the phenomenal stats on these legs.  think<br/>
of a warrior who can cast invisibility, something they have always wanted to<br/>
do and now can.  kunark is not much different from old norrath.<br/>
invisibility still has a very good use.  does this mean all the casters who<br/>
have invis now find it useless in kunark?  no it is still used all the time.<br/>
there are still things in kunark and out that can not see invis.  if the<br/>
mobs see invis, the warrior nor the casters can do anything about in that<br/>
situation, but they still have it for all the other situations where its<br/>
priceless.  summon food or summon drink does me no good.  i could care less<br/>
if those items had any effect at all if that is what they are going to put<br/>
on them.  hell it was better when they had no effect, nothing is better than<br/>
a slap in the face.  no i do not want invisibility, nor a 25str buff like<br/>
warrior items.  i just want something i would want to use.  something that<br/>
would make me say &quot;WOW&quot; like when you hear warrior gloves cast a 25STR buff<br/>
or warrior legs casts invis.  when you hear the effects on bard items you go<br/>
&quot;oh,&quot; hell most really think &quot;oh, that sucks.&quot;  for everyone defending the<br/>
effects on the bard armor, at least admit to yourself that you didn&#39;t say<br/>
&quot;WOW&quot; when you saw them.  there just had to be some small bit of<br/>
disappointment when you heard.  i&#39;m having an awful day at work and maybe<br/>
that&#39;s skewing my thoughts, i just don&#39;t see how the bard effects, in<br/>
comparison to others, can make any bard happy or even satisfied.<br/>
