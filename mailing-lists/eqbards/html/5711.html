<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308236555">i tried it last night, cause i went to kill lord grimlot, a tough SK.  once<br/>
the fight began, i tried to sing and and learned real fast that it is<br/>
strings only, you can&#39;t sing it.  and once the fight was over, the only<br/>
spell left on me was the Steal Strength spell, and the song did not remove<br/>
it.  that&#39;s my only experience with the song so far though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 22 -- Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody.  As far as I can tell, this<br/>
&gt; &gt;       doesn&#39;t do squat.  Never memorized.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It removes any malicious spells on you or your group members.<br/>
&gt; It actually is useful in an area with lots of necros or shamans.<br/>
&gt; This is confirmed, 1st hand information and not off a website =)<br/>
&gt; Especially if those shamans are casting drowsy-line spell one<br/>
&gt; after one after one, if the song cancels those too =) (not sure)<br/>
&gt; Also, have not tried, but I bet you 100:1 ratio that it will remove<br/>
&gt; root.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;       fought anything with disease, it was the undead gnolls in Lake<br/>
&gt; &gt;       Rathe (at the S Karana zone border), and we just had our druid<br/>
&gt; &gt;       cure us after the fight.  No biggie.  I don&#39;t think anyone in<br/>
&gt; &gt;       the party would have even cared for extra disease resistance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Wonder if some spesific song would have been a nice fast<br/>
&gt; way to get rid of all those (only) annoying bad spells laid on<br/>
&gt; you and your group ;)<br/>
