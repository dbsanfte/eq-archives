I remember level 20 as the first really great achievement.  And even now I<br/>
think it is the &quot;best&quot; accomplishment in the game - getting your first<br/>
surname.  When I was level 20, all I knew was that surname really made you<br/>
different.  Ya either had one or not.  At that point level 50 was so distant<br/>
that it was not even a consideration.  Level 20 and then level 32 - that<br/>
defined you as a real bard.<br/>

&gt; Hiya fellow songsters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I finally made 20th level yesterday. It has been a long hard trip so far.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t see how a lot of you guys move up so fast. I am lucky if I can gain<br/>
1<br/>
&gt; level per week. Anyway, I was wondering if you have any ideas for a good<br/>
&gt; surname. I figured ya&#39;ll had probably seen, or thought about it a lot more<br/>
&gt; than I have. I was thinking of using Windsong. Suggestions?<br/>
