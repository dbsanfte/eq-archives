&gt; They do address bard issues when it&#39;s a high priority. Remember when our <br/>
&gt; weapons weren&#39;t proc&#39;ing anymore after one of their patches? They fixed <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm. The only issue I remember with bard weapon procs was when the<br/>
weapon proc&#39;ing would lock up your songs so you had to camp or zone to<br/>
clear it. (actually it was discovered rapidly clicking your hotkeys<br/>
would fix it but very few seemed to know about that trick)<br/>

That didn&#39;t get fixed for a couple of months after I first ran across<br/>
it.<br/>
