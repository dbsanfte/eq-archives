<div id="ygrps-yiv-440972227">Hehe that was me!  I make a beautiful corpse! Sylly crys over a Sylly<br/>
corpse00<br/>
<br/>
I had met up wif a big old ogre and he was gonna show me the &quot;good spot&quot;<br/>
along  the river south of the EK bridge.  Well, he could not get a decent<br/>
pull to save his skin.  We had been zoning constantly and then one time -<br/>
whoops!  I get et by a big ole gryf.  So while loading please wait, I go<br/>
upstairs for just a minute and opps!  I walk too close to my bedroom and get<br/>
charmed by my bed!  When I got back to my pc this morning, there I was<br/>
staring at the zone wall in the arena, wondering what zone I died in &lt;g&gt;  I<br/>
tend to do that a lot!  Really skews my /played times with those 6 and 8<br/>
hour rezones!<br/>
