<div id="ygrps-yiv-939651790">You should read Thott&#39;s article on power curves. (www.afterlifeguild.org) It<br/>
demonstrates that post 50, all classes increase in power exponentially<br/>
except for bards. The reason that all other classes scale that way is<br/>
because of the way the mobs increase in power post 50. Bards however<br/>
progress in power linearly. An argument can be made that we give some power<br/>
for our wealth of abilities, but if you look at the very highest levels, we<br/>
lose all of those additional abilities. Fear caps at 51, Charm caps at 53<br/>
and Mez caps at 55. That means that a level 60 bard fighting level 55+ mobs<br/>
is a liability to the party instead of an asset. We can no longer crowd<br/>
control, our haste and slow is vastly inferior to enchanters and shamen, our<br/>
melee is pathetic (to say the least). Our only role at that point is mana<br/>
battery.<br/>
<br/>
Bards used to be useful in large raids for their ability to provide resists,<br/>
but given the influx of uber gear it is not difficult to obtain unbuffed<br/>
resists in the 150s in multiple areas. Add to that the soft cap on resists<br/>
and the fact that even with maxed resists many, many spells land anyway and<br/>
bards have little to no use in a raid. We can&#39;t provide our primary ability<br/>
(resists) and we don&#39;t do damage, so why bring us along?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bards are not really underpowered in the post 50 game imo.  they are<br/>
only underpowered on large multigroup raids.  why is this?  because<br/>
bards are best at being flexible and filling in the gaps of abilities not<br/>
represented in the group.  generally in most well organized large multigroup<br/>
raids, all abilities ARE represented, leaving little for the bard to do.<br/>
i would say that bards are overpowered in most single group scenarios<br/>
(even post 50) and underpowered in most multi group raids which seems<br/>
as a whole compared to other classes to be overpowered.  paladins/sks/<br/>
necros/druids/mages/rangers all are underpowered in the large raid type<br/>
encounters.<br/>
but they also aren&#39;t any more powerful in single group scenarios or<br/>
unbalanced<br/>
group scenarios either.  necros and druids are slightly compensated in that<br/>
they<br/>
can solo well for most of their careers if they choose to.  but the other<br/>
hybrids<br/>
seem to need some sort of enhancement.<br/>
