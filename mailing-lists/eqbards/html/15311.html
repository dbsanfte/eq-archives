<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504987081">David found an error in my logfile (I&#39;d cut it at the wrong<br/>
place and accidently included some Wakizashi data).  It<br/>
explains the dual wield discrepency, and the somewhat large<br/>
difference in proc rate.  Here&#39;s the corrected comparison:<br/>
<br/>
With the Yak in my primary hand at 87 str, 119 dex, I got:<br/>
<br/>
Ykesha (8/24) in primary<br/>
9223 damage<br/>
508 hits (56.0%)<br/>
399 misses (44.0%)<br/>
20 procs unresisted<br/>
22 procs resisted<br/>
avg dam/hit = 18.2<br/>
melee damage = 4.24 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
melee damage = 7.56 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>
melee damage + procs = 4.93 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
proc rate = 1 per 51.8 sec (1 per 44.0 sec adjusted for Celerity)<br/>
          = 1 per 21.6 swings<br/>
<br/>
With the Yak in my primary hand at 161 str, 131 dex, I got:<br/>
<br/>
Ykesha (8/24) in primary<br/>
6370 damage<br/>
331 hits (57.2%)<br/>
248 misses (42.8%)<br/>
11 procs unresisted<br/>
13 procs resisted<br/>
avg dam/hit = 19.2<br/>
melee damage = 4.58 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
melee damage = 8.02 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>
melee damage + procs = 5.18 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
proc rate = 1 per 57.9 sec (1 per 46.3 sec adjusted for Warsong)<br/>
          = 1 per 24.1 swings<br/>
<br/>
The difference is large enough to likely be statistically<br/>
significant (5% increase in avg damage/hit).  OTOH, we&#39;re<br/>
talking about +74 str here, nearly doubling my strength.  And<br/>
the data for the secondary weapon remains the same - no<br/>
increase due to str.<br/>
<br/>
To put it in perspective, getting all these str buffs<br/>
increased my melee damage by 0.23 points/sec, or only <br/>
0.7 points/mob attack round.  If I&#39;d played Psalm instead and<br/>
the mob landed an average of 1 hit per round, that&#39;d be an<br/>
increase of 8 points/mob attack round.  Heck, Bellow would&#39;ve<br/>
been 20 points/mob attack round if not resisted.  It&#39;s not as<br/>
bad if you&#39;re grouped (other melee classes hit for more damage<br/>
so the same % increase translates into a larger points/sec<br/>
figure), but Chant is still off my list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to do some more tests on the Allizewsaur to get a<br/>
better sample size.<br/>
