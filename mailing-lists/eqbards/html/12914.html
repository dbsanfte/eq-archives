<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001034065">LOL I feel your pain as I am also 30th level.  Right now I have a little<br/>
over one more bub to go to make 30th.  While 30th level, I have primarily<br/>
adventured in three places: Mistmoore, fairy ring in LFAY, and ghost room in<br/>
Unrest.  I started out in Mistmoore but died a couple of times due to bad<br/>
pulls and trains.  Decided to try out fairy ring and that was pretty safe.<br/>
The fairy guards and Gearheart conned blue to me  (plus they drop FS<br/>
weapons).  As long as there were at least 3 people in the group we never had<br/>
any problems.  One time had a full group of six and the action was non-stop<br/>
(fairy guards have fast respawn rate).  As soon as we killed one guard we<br/>
pulled another.  Never had more than a couple minutes of downtime between<br/>
fights.  The other night I was in ghost room with a party of six all in the<br/>
low 30s. Once again the action was non-stop but this time fighting stuff<br/>
that yellow and red to me.  A couple of times it got kinda hairy but thats<br/>
when I stepped up and provided crowd control.  No one died and we never had<br/>
to zone.  Gained two bubs in around three hours of game time.  Heading to<br/>
Cazic to get over the hump and into 31st level.  Can&#39;t stay in one place too<br/>
long.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing to consider about camping in Highpass vs other places.  Highpass<br/>
is a lot safer but not as many spawns and IMO boring as hell.  Since you<br/>
don&#39;t get challenged that much in Highpass, you don&#39;t get to practice the<br/>
bard tactics that you need to know in order to survive in other zones.  On<br/>
the few occasions I have been in Highpass, not once have I ever had to use<br/>
any of our crowd control songs.  Other places are more risky but more<br/>
action, better EXP, better loot.  You might die more often but then again<br/>
you can gain it back faster as well.  When adventuring outside of Highpass,<br/>
I am also wary when I group with someone who I discovered spent several<br/>
levels in Highpass.  From my experience, these players tend to press the<br/>
panic button to soon and bug out on the group when we get a bad pull.  This<br/>
has happened to me on three different occasions.  This obviously doesn&#39;t<br/>
apply to everyone who spent a lot of time in Highpass but just something to<br/>
consider.<br/>
