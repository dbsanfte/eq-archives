kited a SG up and down the coast in Oasis?  If not then you are probably<br/>
doing things right.  I myself have died to irresponsible kiters numerous<br/>
times.  What occurs is the fact that the kiter with JBoots or SOW starts<br/>
to outrun the MOB.  The mob still continues to chase you but it will mob<br/>
anything near it.  Trust me I know, I have died to it while looting a dead<br/>
mob, looting my corpse, while a druid ran by me and even while medding in<br/>
the desert.  Now was this druid kiting?  Of course she was because she was<br/>
having a discussion with some other druids and necros about kiting the<br/>
giants in Oasis.  Let me say that kiting is not bad when done properly,<br/>
when done wrong it it is downright detestable and those people should<br/>
suffer.<br/>
