<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702775476">No easier than snare/bow kiting which is already contained in that class, or<br/>
sow/bow kiting which merely takes a duo.  Although we would get it much<br/>
earlier level-wise.  Also can&#39;t see how a bow would be easier than<br/>
bellow/CoD kiting.  Both would take forever seemingly.  I&#39;m beginning to<br/>
think Verant&#39;s logic when determining what a bard should be able to do was<br/>
always: &quot;They shouldn&#39;t get that, after all they aren&#39;t a TRUE XXX class.&quot;<br/>

	No bind, not a caster class<br/>
	No Parry, not a melee class<br/>
	No special weapons, not a hybrid class<br/>
	etc., etc., etc.<br/>

With our Selos song, having the ability to use a bow would make kiting very<br/>
easy and therefore unbalancing.<br/>

&gt; Have we ever heard exactly WHY we do not get archery? Not being able to<br/>

&gt; the bow was pretty disappointing.<br/>
