<b>Subject:</b> re: playing your bard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-917471805">Somebody posted on this a few days ago and I haven&#39;t<br/>
seen anything since...so here&#39;s my 2 cp:<br/>
<br/>
*** I have noticed that none of the guides on playing<br/>
a bard (that I&#39;ve seen) seem to inlcude indoor vs<br/>
outdoor strategy.<br/>
<br/>
If I am outdoors and soloing or with a small group, I<br/>
like using instruments.  It is fun and if we&#39;re<br/>
engaging multiple mobs I can do proportionate damage<br/>
in exchange for getting most of the attention.  If<br/>
things get really bad, I twist hymm and selos and try<br/>
to run around the party until sombody catches on that<br/>
the bard is about to die.<br/>
<br/>
Indoors or with a melee party I use weapons and sing<br/>
my buffs...anthem, psalm and largos outdoors, and hymm<br/>
indoors.<br/>
<br/>
I try to keep chains handy to snare any runners,<br/>
lullaby for attempting to break trains, pixie strike<br/>
for interupting casters and screech is my panic<br/>
button.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had much chance to work on charming...looks<br/>
like it would be handy but I&#39;m just not that good with<br/>
it yet.<br/>
