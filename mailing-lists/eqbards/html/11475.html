&gt;<br/>
&gt;A few observations. Would like a response<br/>
&gt;heck out this thread. I posted these comments. Anyone else agree with me?<br/>

&gt;+ Added stat and other bonuses to instruments<br/>
&gt;Where? None of my instrument stats changed for the better IE: Bonus? means<br/>
&gt;something added, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Already noted - There are instruments dropped by both dragons, Cazic Thule <br/>
(not sure of stats), and Maestro of Rancor - all with stat buffers, and <br/>
possible increased song effect.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added more Class Specific Quests<br/>
&gt;Lambent. How about some more? Instruments and such. as it is, besides The<br/>
&gt;lambent, bards have some pretty poor quests. (4 I think)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Already noted - ever heard of Charismatic Carrillon? I am the only person in <br/>
my regular group that is able to do the Hero bracer Quest (even tho some of <br/>
my friends have the same faction with the Steel Warriors). You can do any <br/>
Temple Ro Quest even if your starting faction is dubious. Our Lambent quest <br/>
is WAY easier than most of the other Temple Ro armor quests because all of <br/>
our components drop on common mobs. Try getting shaman or cleric quest stuff <br/>
- it&#39;s doable, but you won&#39;t have much fun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added more Class Specific Items<br/>
&gt;Again, We have very few class specific items. I think they added a grand<br/>
&gt;total of 5<br/>
&gt;Look at warriors. They have millions;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the only class anyone can really bitch about as far as <br/>
class-specific is Paladins. They got it all. Oh what&#39;s this? Yet another <br/>
pally holy weapon....<br/>
We get Lambent, Imbrued, the couple weapons in PoH, all the <br/>
instruments...and did you notice we can use MOST 1 hand <br/>
slashers/bashers/piercers in the game? Oh shit man, not to mention crappy <br/>
caster stuff like shimmering orb?!?!? We can use half the caster hand held <br/>
items out there. We can wear a GREAT deal of the melee-type armor you can <br/>
loot on Norrath.<br/>
We are the most versatile class in the game - yet people are STILL bitching <br/>
about not enough bard only items? We have enough, and we can use a TON of <br/>
non-bard specific equipment. Let&#39;s move on to something important.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;+ Corrected Bug that let monsters attack you from far distances through <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;pet<br/>
&gt;Didnt know this was an issue, since charm only lasts ten seconds<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never had this happen/<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added Addition Effects to Some Bard Songs<br/>
&gt;Forgot to mention that Levitate will not work now. Would like to know what<br/>
&gt;effects were added<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Off the top of my head- not sure bout this one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added New Bard Songs<br/>
&gt;New bard songs?, or do you mean, fixed ones that didn&#39;t work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WRONG. When I first started EQ Commercial (which was 2 months after release) <br/>
bards were missing quite a few songs. My favorite song (Victory) didn&#39;t even <br/>
exist. The Tuyen&#39;s line did not exist (not that I minded). Desperate Dirge. <br/>
You think it&#39;s bad now? You must&#39;ve missed beta.. bards were not happy <br/>
campers back then when it came to song selection and broken songs. Keep up <br/>
the noise over the currently broken songs tho, I want them fixed just as <br/>
much as the next bard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added Ability for Bards to Punch &#39;Magic Only&#39; Creatures<br/>
&gt;I thought I could always do this, with magic gloves<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Increased the Power of Some Bard Songs (c.f. Chant Series,<br/>
&gt;Fifil´┐¢s, etc.)<br/>
&gt;Hmm, I have not seen any &quot;Increase&quot; in power of bard songs, only a decrease<br/>
&gt;(IE Lullaby, Lament, Pixie strike, Selo&#39;s) Shouldn&#39;t there be a negative in<br/>
&gt;here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with the mez-type song problems. They get nerfed, fixed, nerfed, <br/>
semi-fixed, nerfed more. Lullaby/Lament worked FINE in beta, why fix what <br/>
ain&#39;t broke? I also noticed a slight slow down in Selo&#39;s.<br/>
Frenzy spawn or death beetle/lava duct crawler spawns can be broken easily <br/>
with Lament still, so I&#39;m not realy complaining about that.<br/>
