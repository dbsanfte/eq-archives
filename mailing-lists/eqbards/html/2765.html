&gt;The thing I like about combines better than the other weapons is the resale<br/>
&gt;value.  You purchase a Dragoon Dirk now for 40 plat, in a couple of months<br/>
&gt;when you get tired of it you won&#39;t get much of a return because of players<br/>
&gt;getting them and flooding the market.  This has already happened with Mino<br/>
&gt;Axes - they used to sell for over 10pp a piece when I first started.  Now<br/>
&gt;you can get them for 3 - 4pp.  Combines you can always sell back for about <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;20% loss, and can sell to another player for a little less than what you<br/>
&gt;paid for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not think the Dragoon Dirks will devalue as much as the mino axes did, <br/>
since they are lore items you can not lug 20 of em to Qeynos to sell :)    <br/>
Also I have always resold my combine weapons on Feydwer and for MORE then I <br/>
bought them.  When people have whined about it I would point out that I am <br/>
saving them at least two hours of time round trip, plus they do not have to <br/>
journey through very hostile territory (esp for combine blunt and piercing <br/>
weapons).<br/>
