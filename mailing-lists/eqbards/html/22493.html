You know - I really have no clue why I keep maintaining this stuff - I did<br/>
quit EQ after all ;)<br/>

You can take the bard out of EQ, but you can&#39;t take EQ out of the bard.  Or<br/>
something like that = :).  Personally, I enjoy seeing your continued<br/>
comments on messages that come across this list.  Whether you still play or<br/>
not, you do have good knowledge to impart to us.  This list is still the<br/>
most active of all the eGroups list I subscribe to.  You and all the folks<br/>
that subscribe here make it that way and are great.<br/>

On a different note, I was at The Concert Hall today and saw a note to check<br/>
the Safehouse for some info.  I did and their Library(guide) section is<br/>
excellent.  Here is the link:<br/>

Thanks.<br/>

&gt;Nice. Was there a reason the following were omitted or did I just miss it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/cast #<br/>
&gt;/sit (on/off)<br/>
&gt;/pause<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, it would be nice if they were separated into different sections by<br/>
&gt;type, but heck, it&#39;s a great list anyway!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually had those in the &quot;buffer&quot; waiting to be added - but I haven&#39;t <br/>
made changes since September.  I&#39;m working on it now, though - so by the <br/>
end of the day, they should be accurate. In fact, if you ever find an error <br/>
or a new command, please don&#39;t hesitate to email<br/>
me.<br/>
