<div id="ygrps-yiv-473669517">&quot;I&#39;ll leave the serious damage dealing to the<br/>
tanks and casters.  I&#39;d rather make them more able to do their jobs than try <br/>
to do it for them.&quot;<br/>

Wow, great line! Mind if I quote you on that the next time I&#39;m having this <br/>
argument with someone? ;) I&#39;ve always felt the same way you do - my main <br/>
job, as a bard, is to make everyone better at their jobs. Yes, perhaps my <br/>
value in a group isn&#39;t as apparent as the wizards&#39;s after he blasts a <br/>
beastie for 500 damage, or the cleric&#39;s after he heals someone for 500 hit <br/>
points... but I feel that what I add to the group, is, in some cases, <br/>
invaluable.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Uh, Dirkson&#39;s point was that adding more money wasn&#39;t necessarily a good<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea just because the amount you were adding was seemingly <br/>
&gt;insignificant.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just because you have a free 18 pt damage shield doesn&#39;t make the choice<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; add another 9 pointer on top of it any more sound.  If you can do more<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage another way its&#39; still better than adding that 9 point damage<br/>
&gt;shield.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kit<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;12 points here, 9 points there, 6 points stacked... pretty soon we are<br/>
&gt; &gt; talking a pretty nice damage shield!&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; p.s. was it the Hon. Everrt Dirkson (sp?) senior senator from the great<br/>
&gt; &gt; state of IL who said:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;A billion dollars here, a billion dollars there, pretty soon we are<br/>
&gt;talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; about some serious money...&quot;<br/>
