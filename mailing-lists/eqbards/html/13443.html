&gt; &gt; 3)  What does it mean to have a lower/higher Hide skill level?  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; *appears* to work perfectly each time.  I hit the button, I disappear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does skill level determine the length of time that it works?  Or whether<br/>
&gt; &gt; the MOBs can see you anyway?  Or anything else at all?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Hide at 40 works about 1 in 5 times for me.  It determined whether<br/>
&gt;   you successfully hide, not the duration or the mob fooling factor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  When I watch myself in the third person, I seem to disappear every single time.  Am I really<br/>
Hiding?  Maybe I should ask the others I&#39;m with to watch?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the other info...<br/>
