<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623493595">Actually, in fairness, it appears people either think the sludged girdle is <br/>
great or is a worthless piece of trash and it is reflected in the pricing <br/>
on some of the web pages out there. Some people have sold it for 250 pp and <br/>
some for over 10k pp according to sites like eqprices.com, eqmaps.com and <br/>
maximumeq.com<br/>
