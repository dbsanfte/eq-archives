&gt;I briefly mentioned this the other day but it didn&#39;t generate any response<br/>
&gt;so I&#39;ll throw it out again.  Based on the recent statements by GZ, there <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;a couple of strikes working against us in regards to the Pixie Strike song.<br/>
&gt;First off, because it has two effects (mezmerize plus magic resist debuff),<br/>
&gt;mobs have an increased chance to resist it.  This is similar to how CoD and<br/>
&gt;DDD work.  CoD only has one effect (AE DOT) while DDD has two (AE DOT and <br/>
&gt;AC<br/>
&gt;debuff).  Mobs resist DDD a lot more than CoD.  Example: I can regularly <br/>
&gt;get<br/>
&gt;CoD to stick against ogre bouncers (with a very high MR).  I don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;waste my time trying to get DDD to stick.  Second strike is the second<br/>
&gt;resist check mobs get against pixie strike (and lullaby).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you combine the higher chance to resist because pixie strike has two<br/>
&gt;effects plus the two chances to resist the song outright, this song is not<br/>
&gt;reliable as we would like it to be.  I propose we submit a petition to<br/>
&gt;Verant requesting that they nerf pixie strike and remove the magic resist<br/>
&gt;debuff.  In this case, the nerf would be an actual improvement in the songs<br/>
&gt;utility.  The mobs still get a second chance to resist but the base resist<br/>
&gt;chance is lower because they are only resisting one effect (mezmerize).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Comments?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hah! This would be the first time that a class petioned to have an ablility <br/>
nerfed!  Maybe instead of petitioning we should report it as being <br/>
overpowered (or even an exploit) that pixie strike lower the MR of the <br/>
target.  It would get changed in an emergency patch that way.<br/>
