<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891817071">Also a way to get around the no drop problem of identifying items would have<br/>
the song identify the item being held of the person you have targeted.<br/>
Instead of having this song self only, make it so you have to target the<br/>
person with the item. So &quot;Bill&quot; holds his Dragoon dirk on his cursor, &quot;Bob&quot;<br/>
targets him and fires up the song then recieves the lore info which he can<br/>
then tell to &quot;Bill&quot; and even make up an interesting story if he so desires.<br/>
On another note, no drop really irks me. I carry around 5 quest items and 6<br/>
no drop weapons and armor which I cant bank. I think the bank inventory<br/>
should just be considered an extension of your personal inventory so you<br/>
should be able to put the no drop items in there. No drop I understand, but<br/>
it is a major inconvenience having to keep it on you constantly<br/>
