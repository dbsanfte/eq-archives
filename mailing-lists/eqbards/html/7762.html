<div id="ygrps-yiv-423518224">After a night out drinking with some old friends, I crawled back to my<br/>
computer, popped online, and loaded up EQ.<br/>
     &quot;I&#39;m in Easht Karana?  Hmmm.... I wonder what Broon consh for now?&quot;<br/>
I conned him... blue at 27.<br/>
     /shout &quot;Broon!  Ye pixeltated piece of orc-lickin&#39; crap!  Get ready to<br/>
die before me!&quot;<br/>
Reverse-kited (Screech-Chains) him until he was almost dead (I was only half<br/>
a bubble of hps down from full), so I decided to stop and melee him down.<br/>
Big mistake.  Luckily I drunkenly changed tactics back to reverse-kite and<br/>
beat him while still having a bubble of hp left.<br/>
Did I say I love Screech?<br/>
