<div id="ygrps-yiv-161719306">The time the Lord wiped us all out he was actually bare fisted, no weapon<br/>
at all.<br/>
He was just too tough, the casters said their spells were resisted so it<br/>
was left down to a bard and a Paladin to deal out the dmg. No chance.<br/>

&gt; I managed to get into the Lord group on sunday, after begging I could<br/>
&gt; handle it (I was level 37) and that it was only the day before that I<br/>
spent<br/>
&gt; the whole day camping the magi. The leader agreed and upon arriving to<br/>
the<br/>
<br/>
The mana song goes far for advancing one&#39;s cause.  :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was already dual wielding Yaks after some fine fortune on friday<br/>
evening,<br/>
&gt; I offered my sharkjaw Cutlass for a Yak and the guy accepted. I was so<br/>
&gt; pleased, no I deal out a modest amount of dmg.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the double-attack folks in my guild are complaining<br/>
about the Yaks being a huge stamina drain (4.5 wt).  They&#39;ve<br/>
been trying to get Wakizashis instead (2.0 wt).  The sharkjaw<br/>
cutlass would fall under the same category (2.0 wt I think).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Spent 8 hours at the Lord camp sunday, made 2 bubs exp and hit level 38<br/>
&gt; (yet another useless song). Only died once and that was because the Lord<br/>
&gt; was too hard. Wiped all but 2 of us out (they gated out). Another group<br/>
&gt; watched us die and didn&#39;t help, hoping they would get the kill but our<br/>
&gt; cleric was bound next to the Lord room and managed to get the exp for us.<br/>
&gt; In total we saw 2 Yaks and 6 SSB&#39;s. I lost every single roll &lt;sigh&gt; I<br/>
never<br/>
&gt; rolled higher than a 62, what is wrong with me???<br/>
<br/>
Heh heh.  Told ya so.  :)  The levels required to hold the<br/>
room is much lower than the levels required to kill the lord<br/>
with a sword.<br/>
