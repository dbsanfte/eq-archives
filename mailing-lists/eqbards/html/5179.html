<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259619944">It seems that Verant has been doing a lot of &#39;stealth nerfing&#39; - but<br/>
they&#39;ve also been doing some stealth patching, too.  Here&#39;s an example: On<br/>
the test server last night, I noted that you can now access a new screen of<br/>
keyboard configurations.  It doesn&#39;t exactly WORK yet ;) But &quot;Reply&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Transparent overlays&quot; are both on there, so they will be configurable.<br/>
Also, new commands are being released: /yell - shouts a generic &quot;Help&quot; and<br/>
the basic direction you are - is NOT zone-wide.  /ftell &lt;message&gt; tells<br/>
everyone on your friends list the message.<br/>
<br/>
See? Verant&#39;s not all bad - and now I can go back to using &quot;R&quot; for Selo&#39;s<br/>
Accelerando! (Get it? R for RUNAWAY!)<br/>
