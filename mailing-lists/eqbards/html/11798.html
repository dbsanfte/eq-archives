<div id="ygrps-yiv-929047877"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes, waiting lists in Sol-B and Kith has been passed by (given up on?) not<br/>
&gt; sure how to explain.  But nobody camps it much - at least as far as I have<br/>
&gt; seen lately.  It was popular then people got sick of trains and then stopped<br/>
&gt; camping it.  It&#39;s a bit too hard I think or players have not learned how.<br/>
&gt; It takes full groups and then even multiple groups helps. Plenty of mobs<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Less bang for the buck.  A L40 enraged black wolf can eliminate an<br/>
  entire party of L35s.  For a group of L45s, the wolf is still a very<br/>
  tough fight.  Too tough for the exp given.  In the time it takes to<br/>
  find + kill those undead, you could have killed 2 or 3 sonic bats<br/>
  in SolB.  When 7am clicks, poof undead go ahead and you are stuck<br/>
  waiting until nightfall.  It&#39;s not worth the time spent.<br/>
