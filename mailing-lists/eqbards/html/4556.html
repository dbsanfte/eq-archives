&gt; &gt; Well the flip side of this is that as you go from level 1 to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 25, you&#39;d gain str and wis, maybe dex and sta.  But as you<br/>
&gt; &gt; went from 25 to 50 you&#39;d lose str, dex, sta, agi, and maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; int while gaining wis.  There are actually systems that do<br/>
&gt; &gt; this, usually coupling older (decreased stats) with wiser<br/>
&gt; &gt; (more skills) and vice versa.  But that&#39;s beyond the scope of<br/>
&gt; &gt; this list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The way I&#39;d look at it would be that level 50 is (currently) the &quot;prime&quot; of<br/>
&gt; a player. The player is the best they can be so to speak. So this would be<br/>
&gt; the prime time of their life. The same would go to 75 if that&#39;s what the cap<br/>
&gt; was raised to. I don&#39;t agree with the curve from low at 1 to high at 25 to<br/>
&gt; low at 50 again. 50 is when you&#39;re at your peak so to speak in my opinion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well then I would say don&#39;t use reality as an argument to back<br/>
up your stance then.  You want stats that improve as you<br/>
progress, you don&#39;t want realism.  :-)  Verant chose a system<br/>
where your stats stay the same.  It may seem different, but as<br/>
I mentioned, it&#39;s by far the norm in RPGs.  Think of it as<br/>
starting level 1 when you&#39;re at your peak, and never suffering<br/>
the effects of aging.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ack!  That&#39;s even worse!  You want everyone to be clones of<br/>
each other?  :-)<br/>
