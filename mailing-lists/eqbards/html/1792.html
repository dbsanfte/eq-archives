<div id="ygrps-yiv-937951447">After 800 plus spells, Geoffrey admits to being *temporarily* short on<br/>
creativity.<br/>
<br/>
The initial song idea and framework, along with three working titles, was<br/>
mine, Geoffrey poked holes in it, had to the insight to make bards immune to<br/>
mana regen, picked one of the three titles, and took it to the next stage<br/>
for approval.  Ryan freaked out, calmed down, and then the coders went to<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Due to an error with the export Monday, the song wasn&#39;t placed at the proper<br/>
vendors (Freeport and Qeynos guild halls, don&#39;t cry foul, wood elves, by<br/>
43rd, you should be all over the world with ease, and it just didn&#39;t fit in<br/>
with the song &#39;themes&#39; in Kelethin), and isn&#39;t active on the spell tables<br/>
yet.  Next chance for an export, it should be up and running just fine.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, it&#39;s level 43, and you will like it, a lot.  Just don&#39;t waste it<br/>
blasting poor rats and bats!  It takes a long while to regen that much mana.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and to alleviate fears, bard mana is based on...CHA and DEX.<br/>
<br/>
Any bard 43rd level, no matter what race, and what his or her choice of<br/>
stats turned out to be, should be able (barring missed notes) to cast it.<br/>
Mana requirements were very closely tuned, based on the minimum natural<br/>
stats in CHA and DEX any player would have, at 43rd.<br/>
<br/>
CHA or DEX inhibiting items and effects should be avoided if you have<br/>
baseline stats in either, as they can potentially reduce your mana to the<br/>
point where you don&#39;t have enough to cast.  So, don&#39;t pick on the skunks,<br/>
and don&#39;t get fatigued! Other than that, you should be just fine.<br/>
<br/>
The natural increase in mana per level still only allows a 50th level bard<br/>
one shot, same as those with exceptionally high DEX and CHA, or using a lot<br/>
of mana boosting items, so they are not going to be able to sing it much<br/>
more often, maybe shaving a minute or so off the recast time, thanks to<br/>
having a slightly larger mana reserve to draw from.  Rather than being OOM<br/>
after singing it once, they may have a sliver of mana left.<br/>
<br/>
One note, the 49th level Shaman forty point Dexterity buff, and the 49th<br/>
level Enchanter forty point Charisma buff, when stacked,  boosts your mana<br/>
less than a bar at 43rd, to give you some indication of the minor impact<br/>
higher stat scores have on this song.<br/>
<br/>
Get in the habit of sitting down more often.  Easy to do, just mimic the<br/>
rest of your party, poor slobs who HAVE to sit between every fight, for one<br/>
reason or another.  Just like hitpoints, mana regens faster when you are on<br/>
your butt.<br/>

&gt;when you say &quot;We&#39;d kicked around the idea around&quot;, does that mean you are<br/>
&gt;part of the development team?  i know you are level 45+ bard right?<br/>
anyway,<br/>
&gt;any info on where the song is found?  i think the 5 bard vendors have been<br/>
&gt;checked. plus i heard it is level 43, so i want it =)<br/>

&gt;It has no effect at all on Clarity and the rate at which your party members<br/>
&gt;regen mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Desperate Dirge is VERY powerful for a bard song.  Most bard songs are<br/>
&gt;classified as cantrips, quick little spells that have minor duration and<br/>
&gt;impact when song once, but add up over time.  This song breaks out of that<br/>
&gt;mold completely.  The mana use, and the lack of regen, was needed to keep<br/>
it<br/>
&gt;from being overused.  As the name implies, it&#39;s a last ditch effort on the<br/>
&gt;bard&#39;s part to end a combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;d kicked around the idea of the song stunning the bard for 10 to 30<br/>
&gt;seconds as another balance factor, or using a horn or lute as a consumable<br/>
&gt;reagent, but neither proved practical, or easy to code.  The change making<br/>
&gt;bards immune to mana regen was relatively easy to implement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s going to take at least 30 minutes of just sitting to regen all that<br/>
&gt;mana once you cast the song, twice that if you remain standing.  And thats<br/>
&gt;as it should be.  The song rivals harm touch at that level in damage done<br/>
(A<br/>
&gt;43rd level SK can do 430 to a SINGLE target), and this song will hit FOUR<br/>
&gt;targets.  That&#39;s 1600 damage, fast.  It&#39;s use should be limited.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And it might encourage bards to wear more mana and mana stat boosting<br/>
items,<br/>
&gt;so they can have a larger mana reserve to draw from, speeding downtime<br/>
&gt;between songs a bit.  This is fine, as it means in most cases that they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;have to give up better armor to wear the low or no AC caster tuned garb.<br/>

&gt;I read it the same way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, the patch message seemed to indicate their would be no method<br/>
&gt;possible to speed up a bard&#39;s mana regen rate, it gave no indication of any<br/>
&gt;change that would alter how current bard songs *may* speed mana regen for<br/>
&gt;other party members (or maybe I just read it wrong).<br/>
