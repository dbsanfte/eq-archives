<div id="ygrps-yiv-830546596"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kblair@...">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Clerics, Druids, and shaman are priest classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok let&#39;s go with that. What is that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They can cast spells.. Caster.<br/>
&gt;They can use weapons and armor.. Fighter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry, from what I can tell that&#39;s a hybrid. If you<br/>
&gt;want to call it a priest, then I&#39;d say a priest is<br/>
&gt;a hybrid. If Clerics, Druids or Shamen aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;hybrids because they&#39;re priests and get their powers<br/>
&gt;from their dieties, then a Bard isn&#39;t a hybrid either<br/>
&gt;because their power comes from music. NO other class<br/>
&gt;does that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re claiming that &quot;preists&quot; aren&#39;t hybrids because<br/>
&gt;of *where* their abilities come from. Thinking along<br/>
&gt;those lines you simply can not disagree that a Bard<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be a hybrid because of where HIS abilities<br/>
&gt;come from like no other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The fact is that they have multiple abilities from<br/>
&gt;other different classes just like a Bard does.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This whole conversation about was is/isn&#39;t a hybrid is pointless.  Under <br/>
Verant&#39;s system Druids, Clerics, and Shamans are NOT hybirds.<br/>
The Hybrid classes are Rangers, Paladins, Shadow Knights, and Bards.<br/>
End of discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Can we please KABONG the whole what is/isn&#39;t hybrid thread? The binding <br/>
arguement is creating enough email as it is :p<br/>
