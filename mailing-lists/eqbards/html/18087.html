<div id="ygrps-yiv-916425110">oh it said Sartori Stormraven (it did i&#39;m not crazy).  is Stormraven your<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I&#39;m hoping that at least 51 will be purchaseable right off <br/>
&gt; the bat. I bought <br/>
&gt; and scribed Circle of Combines for my druid last night. I was <br/>
&gt; tempted to <br/>
&gt; cast it. I&#39;m sure it will probably just safe zone you, but <br/>
&gt; knowing Verant it <br/>
&gt; might throw you out of the world or something. I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; following you on the <br/>
&gt; last name question.<br/>
