<div id="ygrps-yiv-841725070">All I can say is that you are not foraging often<br/>
enough--that is obvious.  What do you do on long runs?<br/>
 I click forage right before I sit down to heal after<br/>
each fight.  I have four stacks of different food<br/>
items and I have 4 stacks of water.  I have on<br/>
occasion had to buy water--but only because at that<br/>
time I was keeping only 2 stacks of water<br/>
going---Sometimes you run into a dry spell, so to<br/>
speak.  Anyway, except for the occasional lack of<br/>
water--if you can&#39;t forage enough food to never buy<br/>
food again then I don&#39;t know what to tell you.  It&#39;s<br/>
not a bug and I doubt my forage works alot better than<br/>
yours (although I am maxed at 40).<br/>

&gt; Hehe, less than 50%, he says.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would guess my forage works about 5% to 10% at<br/>
&gt; best.  I&#39;ve got it up in<br/>
&gt; the high 30&#39;s (not maxed at 40 yet).<br/>
&gt; It seems to take FOREVER to get a skill increase.  I<br/>
&gt; never forage enough to<br/>
&gt; keep me fed, I always have to get some food at the<br/>
&gt; shop, so i generally get<br/>
&gt; 20 bread when I get water.  Also, I seem to get<br/>
&gt; water about 30% of the time<br/>
&gt; I do get a success.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m gonna mess with a log parser and see what the<br/>
&gt; actual rates are, if not,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll try to load my logs up into something to get<br/>
&gt; some more definate<br/>
&gt; figures.<br/>
&gt; As it is, forage is not enough to even keep me fed,<br/>
&gt; much less keep enough<br/>
&gt; water around to drink.<br/>
