&gt; &gt;Okey, from personal experience... &quot;The Dead&quot; is the name for the Dark Elf<br/>
&gt; &gt;Shadowknights Guild, and I believe the Eldritch Collective has something to<br/>

&gt; Affirmative - Eldritch Collective is the Gnomes Magic-Guild (includes all<br/>

didn&#39;t kill it, my paladin and cleric friends did saying that<br/>
necromancers deserved to die, and as a bard I got hit with the<br/>
faction loss).  I lost faction with &quot;class 41.&quot;<br/>
