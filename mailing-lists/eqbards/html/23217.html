positively dashing in the lambent helm.  :)  I&#39;ve heard that wood elves in<br/>
the helm aren&#39;t as so...attractive.  :)<br/>

<br/>
Ok well i am about to start my 47th eq character :)<br/>
<br/>
This time i might try a bard, and i had pretty well narrowed the race down<br/>
to one of the 2 elves. I know all the pros and cons of each race, so what i<br/>
was looking for here was what they look like in plate (yes i am really that<br/>
vain :) )<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if someone knew an url that had pictures of the various<br/>
races in lambent, bronze, FS plate, imbrued etc.<br/>
<br/>
I had tried the fashion table at allakhazams, but the quality of the<br/>
screenshots isnt that good<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
