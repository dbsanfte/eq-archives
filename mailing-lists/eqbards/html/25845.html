&gt;Shadows of Lust: Subconsciously Selling Sex, Power, and Prestige in an<br/>
&gt;EverQuest┬« Expansion Advertisement<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;The business man&#39;s hunt for sales boosters is leading him into a strange<br/>
&gt;wilderness: the subconscious mind.&quot;<br/>
&gt;(Wall Street Journal, pg. 1. qtd. Packard 22)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mike turns twenty-three this year. He is a single male and recent college<br/>
&gt;graduate who earns about $20 per hour. He casually plays some computer<br/>
&gt;games, surfs the net, and chats online. In early 2002, Mike visits a<br/>
&gt;computer game retail store to consider how he will spend some of his free<br/>
&gt;time and money. He browses the pages of<br/>
&gt;PCGamer, &quot;The World&#39;s Best-Selling Computer Game Magazine&quot; (Imagine Media).<br/>
&gt;One third of the way through he pauses to look at a folded, three-page wide<br/>
&gt;advertisement insert.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Underneath the embossed small-capitalized, gold letters of &quot;EverQuest┬«&quot;<br/>
&gt;lies the title of the painting, &quot;The Shadows of Luclin tm.&quot; A globe fills<br/>
&gt;the black sky background; in it swirl clouds, land, and water. In the<br/>
&gt;foreground stands a tiger-man with sword and a snarling wolf, both looking<br/>
&gt;off page. A fair elf-maiden in soft, scanty clothing suddenly glances into<br/>
&gt;the eyes of the viewer. Although her expression is neutral, her lips<br/>
&gt;slightly part. Mike unfolds the advertisement, buys the game, and starts his<br/>
&gt;subscription to the service required to play the game, because he has<br/>
&gt;subconsciously longed to become that tiger and meet that woman. Mike is a<br/>
&gt;hypothetical example of the target viewer of the advertisement: single<br/>
&gt;male, age 20-25 (Castronova 24), computer savvy, and familiar with the<br/>
&gt;fantasy-genre (Yee). What appears to be an advertisement for a game service<br/>
&gt;is much more; it is a subconscious advertisement for sex, power, and prestige.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The advertisement consciously sells technical power. The copy stresses the<br/>
&gt;technical power of this game: &quot;high-resolution&quot;, &quot;complete 3D overhaul&quot;,<br/>
&gt;with &quot;over four times the number of polygons&quot; (Sony). The advertisement<br/>
&gt;mentions this evidence to persuade the reader that he will become more<br/>
&gt;technically powerful by using this game. The advertisement includes a<br/>
&gt;sweepstakes that sells power to the customer. The sweepstakes is rich with<br/>
&gt;allusions to what the &quot;Power Player&quot; (Sony) may win: the &quot;most incredible<br/>
&gt;PC gaming system available&quot; (Sony). Superlatives topple over each other to<br/>
&gt;impress the viewer about its power and speed. For example, the manufacturer<br/>
&gt;cleverly compares the machine to a bird of prey and the speed of sound by<br/>
&gt;dubbing the computer both &quot;Falcon&quot; and &quot;MACH V&quot;. This technical power<br/>
&gt;appeals to the target white-collar male. Mechanical, or in this case<br/>
&gt;computational, power reassures him of his masculinity (Packard 74).<br/>
&gt;Although a computer is not as masculine as a car, anything that is more<br/>
&gt;powerful is a symbolic increase of the owner&#39;s virility (Packard 75).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The advertisement&#39;s painting uses the tiger-man as a syntagm (an object<br/>
&gt;that symbolically represents a concept within a paradigm, Dyer 126) to sell<br/>
&gt;male sexual power. A tiger-man stands, ready to fight in the painting&#39;s<br/>
&gt;foreground. The tiger is a symbol of sexual power in Asia and is at least a<br/>
&gt;symbol of practical power in the West. Here he accentuates his virility. He<br/>
&gt;carries a sword, reveals his sharp fangs and muscular form. His fur color<br/>
&gt;is almost a fiery orange. He stands in a dominant position, about one-foot<br/>
&gt;higher than the delicate elf-maiden. These details communicate to the<br/>
&gt;viewer that this male model is dominant (Dyer 97-100). Although probably<br/>
&gt;unintentional by the artist, the viewer will at least subconsciously notice<br/>
&gt;that the tiger-man and elf-maiden come close to joining. The tiger-man<br/>
&gt;handles a snarling wolf, which in some ways is an extension of himself. It<br/>
&gt;shares similar fangs, fur, a white underside, and a potent demeanor.<br/>
&gt;Because the tiger-man has a humanoid body and tiger&#39;s head, the target<br/>
&gt;viewer identifies with him. The animal head is like a theatrical,<br/>
&gt;religious, or mythic mask. The tiger is the target viewer&#39;s self-image<br/>
&gt;(Packard 45).  Any male can symbolically become the tiger. The viewer,<br/>
&gt;invoking the tiger, feels vigor, power, and virility. Thus a bond is made.<br/>
&gt;As Dyer wrote: &quot;[O]nce this initial connection has been made we almost<br/>
&gt;automatically accept the object for the feeling.&quot; (116)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Besides power, the viewer has another reason to identify with the<br/>
&gt;tiger-man: to meet the woman of his dreams (Packard 74). The elf-maiden in<br/>
&gt;this painting is the ideal girlfriend of the target viewer. Except for her<br/>
&gt;pointed ears, she looks completely human. But she does not look like just<br/>
&gt;any human. To the target viewer, she is an ideal sex-image. She appears to<br/>
&gt;be a fair-skinned, slender woman about eighteen to twenty-two years old,<br/>
&gt;which is ideal for the target market. She adorns herself in scanty,<br/>
&gt;form-fitting clothing. She has long blonde hair, which may symbolically<br/>
&gt;represent healthy sexuality (Dyer 135). Her pose and scanty clothing reveal<br/>
&gt;most of her body to the viewer, which allows him to judge her beautiful<br/>
&gt;physique. The viewer has a lot to like. She wears soft, delicate, baby blue<br/>
&gt;colors, which helps make her seem innocent and virginal. Therefore, she has<br/>
&gt;some of the characteristics of an archetypal maiden, although this one is<br/>
&gt;not a helpless maiden. Her staff symbolizes that she is powerful. So far,<br/>
&gt;her body and clothes communicate her beauty, power, and innocence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But the attraction extends beyond the flesh, because she shares one of the<br/>
&gt;interests of the viewer: interest in the fantasy genre. She wears fantastic<br/>
&gt;clothes, carries a magical staff, and adorns herself with exotic emerald<br/>
&gt;jewelry. That is rare. Male fantasy-genre fans vastly outnumber female fans<br/>
&gt;on Earth. Most women have little interest in the fantasy genre and have<br/>
&gt;little interest in a Dungeons & DragonsR-style game, but she has great<br/>
&gt;interest in it. She participates in an exciting battle against fantastic<br/>
&gt;foes. To the target viewer, this increases her appeal and partly bridges<br/>
&gt;lust to romance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yet romance requires mutual interest, and some exists here. She at least<br/>
&gt;recognizes the viewer. Out of the ten humanoids in the painting, she is the<br/>
&gt;only one that is gazing into the eyes of the viewer. She looks at him with<br/>
&gt;a neutral expression, but lips slightly parted. She establishes eye<br/>
&gt;contact. By virtue of the stillness of a painting, she maintains eye<br/>
&gt;contact indefinitely. She gets the viewer&#39;s attention and transfers it, by<br/>
&gt;her pose, to the rest of the painting to her right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The whole of the painting evokes nostalgia in the target viewer. The art<br/>
&gt;style is reminiscent of Dungeons & Dragons┬« games and fantasy novel covers,<br/>
&gt;which the target viewer has probably seen (Yee). The characters and<br/>
&gt;creatures are straight from common fantasy novels and games. The title<br/>
&gt;&quot;EverQuest┬«&quot; sells the core activity of fantasy novels: the quest. The<br/>
&gt;subtitle &quot;The Shadows of Luclin tm&quot; reminds the viewer of common fantasy<br/>
&gt;novel and game titles. Thus, this ad offers roots. It appeals to the viewer<br/>
&gt;who has played or read the fantasy genre. The target viewer needs these<br/>
&gt;roots (Packard 76).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The product&#39;s service gives the viewer companions to share these roots<br/>
&gt;with. The ad repeatedly hammers the companionship available: &quot;Join hundreds<br/>
&gt;of thousands of real people&quot;, &quot;make friends&quot;, &quot;take part&quot;, and &quot;play<br/>
&gt;cooperatively&quot; (Sony). Appeal to companionship helps sell the product<br/>
&gt;(Packard 272).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If sex or companionship fail, then all is not lost for the publisher. The<br/>
&gt;advertisement also gratifies the viewer&#39;s ego and reassures his worth<br/>
&gt;(Packard 72). The golden warrior in the center of combat is rich. His armor<br/>
&gt;is rich and prestigious. By transference, the owner of the armor is rich<br/>
&gt;and prestigious. By identification, the viewer accepts the self-image of<br/>
&gt;the golden warrior. The viewer can become the golden warrior. He is<br/>
&gt;positioned facing away from the viewer, so his face is not visible. The<br/>
&gt;viewer may imagine the face to be the viewer&#39;s own face. This position is<br/>
&gt;also similar to a third-person view that is used in many games.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;The Shadows of Luclin tm&quot; expansion advertisement communicates much more<br/>
&gt;than a casual observation would consciously recognize. The advertisement<br/>
&gt;wins the heart of the target viewer, usually without the target viewer<br/>
&gt;being aware of the influence. The artful advertisement may influence the<br/>
&gt;target viewer to buy the product and service without being aware of why. If<br/>
&gt;asked, the viewer might rationalize that he had been sold a game (Packard<br/>
&gt;14), but the nonverbal offer was sex, power, and prestige.<br/>
