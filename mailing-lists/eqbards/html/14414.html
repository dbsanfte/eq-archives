<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790445396">Heh you know whats funny? I bet most necros will quit about 34-43 when you<br/>
have a very very long and depressing dry spot. They are powerful in the end<br/>
but it doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t have to work for it.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Interesting that you pick one of the few classes that didn&#39;t stage a sit<br/>
&gt;&gt; in as they ultimate in whining. From my direct experience, Warriors were<br/>
&gt;&gt; way less whiny than Druids and Necros were, most Warriors I started out<br/>
&gt;&gt; with back in March picked the more direct route of just not playing<br/>
&gt;&gt; Warriors any more (for real, not just threatened to)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  This isn&#39;t an attack against younger people, however look at the<br/>
&gt;  average age of druids/necros.  Druids/Necros are two of the most<br/>
&gt;  powerful solo&#39;ing classes in the game (the powerleveler&#39;s dream<br/>
&gt;  if you will).  It&#39;s only fitting that those immature very young<br/>
&gt;  powergaming types, a stereotype of both classes mind you, would<br/>
&gt;  whine much like a child who just had his lollipop taken from him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Younger people (&lt; 16 yr old) need and want attention, and in EQ<br/>
&gt;  the majority of the attention comes when you are powerful (with<br/>
&gt;  items or level).  I think both these classes represent the power<br/>
&gt;  of the game to those people.  Just my take on it, and this clearly<br/>
&gt;  doesn&#39;t fit all the players, as I know we have 12 yr old Bards and<br/>
&gt;  I know some 30 yr old Necros.<br/>
