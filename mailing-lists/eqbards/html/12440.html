<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828133163">You&#39;ll have to forgive me, but I stopped believing anything Abashi posts,<br/>
but here&#39;s yet another reason why:<br/>
<br/>
A player asked &quot;Why hell levels?&quot; and as has been answered by Brad McQ a few<br/>
months ago, (paraphrased) &quot;Many MUDs had them, they are a part of the game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Abashi on 01/04/00,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s the way the experience curves work. Unfortunately, going in and fixing<br/>
it at this point isn&#39;t an option. Anyone who had gone through a &quot;hell level&quot;<br/>
would instantly get another level or two. Additionally, people who had<br/>
already fought there way through several of them would be cheated out of the<br/>
work they did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To be polite, there is at least a &quot;disconnect&quot; between their PR guy and the<br/>
dev team.  Abashi&#39;s posts are very political, rarely answering our questions<br/>
definitively (he must have a macro for the phrase &quot;on-going issues&quot; as often<br/>
as he uses it) and always loaded with a sickly sweet ass kissing.  I&#39;m<br/>
sorry, but I don&#39;t want to hear excuses or &quot;the upside&quot; to a bug.  Fix it.<br/>
That&#39;s why we PAY to play.<br/>
<br/>
Verant is guilty of what happens to so many MUD admins: they forget what its<br/>
like to play the game.  Aside from the implementers, most MUD admin teams<br/>
are drawn from the player base, and usually are the ones that were highly<br/>
successful.  Two things happen at this point that make you a less effect<br/>
admin person as time goes on:<br/>
<br/>
(1) All the smoke and mirrors are gone and you see how the game mechanics<br/>
work.  Initially this is a very good thing, since you can take your existing<br/>
knowledge of how to play the game and can tweak the balance correctly.  This<br/>
later is a problem because players come to you with problems however you<br/>
&quot;know&quot; how something works and you don&#39;t need this mere player telling you<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
(2) You forget what it was like to play the game.  This clearly plagues<br/>
Verant, buffing chars up to an appropriate level and loading gear so they<br/>
don&#39;t have to &quot;deal&quot; with the miseries of low levels to get to mid levels to<br/>
&quot;play test&quot; eliminates the learning curve in between.  This most clearly<br/>
manifests itself in Brad McQ&#39;s response to melee classes not being able to<br/>
bind anywhere:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The idea is that casters are more prone to dying (especially in group<br/>
situations, in the depths of dungeons, when something goes bad) and thus can<br/>
bind in more places. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Clearly Verant hasn&#39;t played with the gating cleric or the stun|mez|gate<br/>
enchanter.  The game mechanics are lost upon them.  The fact binding a<br/>
dungeon is a bug is immaterial; you bind just outside the zone.  The only<br/>
place I can think of this not being the case is dragon runs or lower guk.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh, sorry for the rant, but reading his stuff and seeing it taken as the<br/>
word and the truth annoy me to no end.<br/>
