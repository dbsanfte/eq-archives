<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-786346947">i have only tried it on merchants that would not let me buy/sell, i believe<br/>
they were dubious.  i get different results with the song though.  for<br/>
example, in west commons with a dubious merchant, i was able to sing and get<br/>
the merchant to indifferent and sell to me.  in oasis at the inn, i was<br/>
unable to sing but with a flute i could get the merchant to indifferent.<br/>
however, in south ro with singing and with a flute, i can not raise the dark<br/>
elf merchants at all, they remain dubious.  so maybe it depends on how<br/>
dubious you really are (close to apprehensive or close to scowls).  haven&#39;t<br/>
used enough to determine if level matters.  i did not buy the song until<br/>
level 50, when i read about it on this list... pretty bad huh?  coupled with<br/>
the fact that i am not a frequent visitor to my home town hehe.<br/>
