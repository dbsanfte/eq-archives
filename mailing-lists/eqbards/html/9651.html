<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190153755">Well, it is a double edged sword - if you don&#39;t group you cant really get<br/>
xp.  But if you do group, you may need to endure some bad groups. After 31,<br/>
I predict you will be a lot more intent on not dieing - at least I was (am).<br/>
CT has some hard spots where you - or anyone -- simply will not survive for<br/>
very long unless you have a well balanced group:  this MEANS you HAVE to<br/>
have a HEALER.  And a real one.  A ranger and a bard don&#39;t make even a half<br/>
healer. Maybe a druid and a sha together make a healer.  You were doomed<br/>
from the get go. But his gating away was nasty too.<br/>
<br/>
What I have been thinking is what bards really need is Feign Death.  We do<br/>
so much of the real thing - we ought to be pretty good at faking it.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I have been thinking of trying is the potion that you can<br/>
buy that casts shadow step.   Yes, we got Melifioius motion but maybe the<br/>
whole party does not want to be teleported when u do.  And maybe you don&#39;t<br/>
feel like seeing the bottom of lake Rathe (although sometimes even there<br/>
would be preferable to where you are.)  But anyhow - for inside places we<br/>
really do not have any sort of &quot;get out of dieing free&quot; card like gate,<br/>
feign, shadow step, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Screech gets resisted - even with brass. Speaking of which, I think that I<br/>
have really neglected that skill.  I don&#39;t use it much so I bet it has not<br/>
kept up.  My denons is resisted a lot more than chords it seems and screech<br/>
has been resisted a bunch recently too.  I think its time to have a Shady<br/>
little concert again.  The skill says master but any skill with points over<br/>
100 is considered mastered.  But if not used it may not be mastered as far<br/>
as it possible? <br/>
<br/>
SIDEBAR:  How many zones is it from Halas to the Exe room in old guk?<br/>
That&#39;s what I was looking at last night. (Remind me to re-bind tonight!!)<br/>
Another benefit of groups over 30.  Clerics (the one who is in your group<br/>
because now you don&#39;t group unless there is one) can rez* u back so binding<br/>
becomes less of an issue.  Corpse finding and dragging do come into play.<br/>
You will be consenting to get your corpse dragged.<br/>
<br/>
All this boils down to how to get better groups.  One way is join a good<br/>
guild.  In a good guild - it might have a lot of players your level so its<br/>
easy to find groups  - or find groups that they are in.  Typically, it&#39;s not<br/>
an all guild group but if you got a lot of guildies, its easier to find a<br/>
group that needs some one.  /guildsay   &quot;Hey, I see u r in Highkeep - any<br/>
room for me?&quot;  &quot;Ya, I will save a spot for you - hurry!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Also, you will meet other guilds and there are guild alliances.  You will<br/>
feel a lot better consenting a guildie to drag you than some one u never met<br/>
before and never saw his name before.  And you are prolly wearing your guild<br/>
buddy&#39;s steel greaves or borrowing his Crys Blade so he&#39;s got some vested<br/>
interest in helping you get your corpse back. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*	rez = resurrect or revive you - they need to be able to target your<br/>
corpse then cast rez on it and it zones you back - with a debilitating<br/>
effect that takes a few minutes to wear off - and no mana - which don&#39;t<br/>
matter that much to a bard but to other casters it does.<br/>

		Well it was bound to happen sooner or later - I finally met<br/>
an EQ player<br/>
		A Ranger, Rogue, Enchanter and a bard.  We decided to go<br/>
ahead<br/>
		and try and hold the spot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		The other thing that I learned is that when I&#39;m in pickup<br/>
		groups I should always have some sort of personal protection<br/>
song memmed<br/>
		like Screech - a word from the just-a-bit-wiser.<br/>
<br/>
		SIDEBAR:<br/>
		Why don&#39;t people realize that it&#39;s THREE zones to Cazic from<br/>
Arena and SIX<br/>
		zones to Cazic from Freeport??  Is there swimming skill just<br/>
so low that<br/>
		they don&#39;t want to swim Lake Rathe?<br/>
