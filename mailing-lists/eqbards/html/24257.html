<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215438055">Yes both Pixie and Twilight move the mob based on the way the bard is<br/>
facing.  Also you to easily vector mob placement once you get the hang of it<br/>
(practice it on newbie mobs).<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Pixie Strike oddity<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Was using Pixie in Karnors last weekend and noticed something really odd.<br/>
I&#39;ve always assumed the knockback component pushed the mob away from the<br/>
Bard.  Instead, it pushes it in the direction the Bard is facing (was very<br/>
handy to learn &#39;cause we were in the tower, and it&#39;s easy to knock mobs off<br/>
of it :).  Does anyone know if the 53rd song does the same?  Only 51 here,<br/>
so it&#39;s gonna be a while before I can test it.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, anyone ever climbed outside of Chardok? : )<br/>

was a blast.<br/>
