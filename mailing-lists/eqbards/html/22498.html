<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] The new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-691645707">If we do in fact get the new Rune song for lvl 49, we may actually<br/>
be able to tank when we need to.  I will do some testing tonight myself, and<br/>
see if it stacks with Verses of Victory or any of our other battle songs.<br/>
<br/>
	I hate to say it, but maybe our persistant testing and posting has<br/>
paid off finally.  Matter of fact I wont say that, since VI will probably<br/>
just nerf us again anyhow!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; So the new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation looks like it will help us<br/>
&gt; solo<br/>
&gt; blue mobs tremendously.  If it still included the rune shield, soloing<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; be even easier coz there would be less downtime for healing.  <br/>
