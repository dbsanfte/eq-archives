<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785341392">I have trouble remembering, myself.  The Anti-Magic Aura strips the first buff in the list.  The<br/>
Disenchanting Melody strips buffs at random from all party members.  I don&#39;t know whether different buffs<br/>
have different counters, or whether resists play a part, but the Melody doesn&#39;t always strip a buff on<br/>
every pulse.<br/>
<br/>
I use the Melody to strip party members of buffs prior to Dragon buffing.  It saves the Clerics a lot of<br/>
work and some mana.<br/>

&gt; cleric and druid buffs as well as some DOT&#39;s. Be careful too, since<br/>
&gt; Alenia&#39;s affects the whole group, that you don&#39;t wipe everyone&#39;s buffs off.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t use this song all that often, if anything, I usually want<br/>
&gt; Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura to debuff a mob. But after a while I forget<br/>
&gt; which one is which. You&#39;d think I&#39;d have it down by now since Alenia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; requires a string instrument.<br/>
