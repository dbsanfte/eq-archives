<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116644614">Okay... next time I post something I should wait until I&#39;m awake. My response to the post about &quot;enchanters vs bards&quot; said nothing to answer the question the person asked. I apologise for wasting everyone&#39;s time. I guess I should really read my posts before I make them. Sorry guys!<br/>
