<br/>
Somebody once told me that DVinn is gonna roll me<br/>
I ain&#39;t the sharpest tank in the CB<br/>
He was looking kind of dumb with his finger coming up<br/>
To make a rude gesture at me<br/>
<br/>
Well the orcs start coming and they don&#39;t stop coming<br/>
Fed with the group and I hit the ground running<br/>
Didn&#39;t make sense not to stay for fun<br/>
Your train gets lunch but your group gets dumb<br/>
So much to do so much to see<br/>
So what&#39;s wrong with taking time to flee<br/>
They&#39;ll never care if you don&#39;t show<br/>
You&#39;ll never live if you don&#39;t go<br/>
<br/>
Hey now! you&#39;re a caster; get your spell off--kill steal...<br/>
Hey now! you&#39;re a tank so start the melee for real<br/>
And all that glitters is gold<br/>
Only singing bards break the mold<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a tough place and they say it gets tougher<br/>
You´┐¢re freaked out now but wait &#39;til it gets rougher<br/>
But the spellflinging men beg to differ<br/>
Judging by the hole in the screenshot pictures<br/>
Your hit point bar is looking pretty thin<br/>
The water looks safe so you might as well swim<br/>
My orc&#39;s on fire; how about yours?<br/>
That&#39;s the way I like it so I never get gored<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Somebody once asked, &quot;Could you please come save my ass?<br/>
I need some help to get away from this place!&quot;<br/>
I said yep what a concept<br/>
I could use a little help myself<br/>
And we could all use a little save<br/>
<br/>
Well the trains start coming and they don&#39;t stop coming<br/>
Fed with the zone and I hit the ground running<br/>
Didn&#39;t make sense not to stay for fun<br/>
The train gets lunch but your group gets dumb<br/>
So much to do so much to see<br/>
So what&#39;s wrong with keeping your XP<br/>
They&#39;ll never help if you don&#39;t shout<br/>
You&#39;ll never live unless you get out<br/>
