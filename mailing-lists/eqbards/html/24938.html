&gt; Ups returned to work and saw 25 messages in the bards list.. Thought they<br/>
&gt; REALLY did screw something up.. And then it was my little bad joke that<br/>
gave<br/>
&gt; reason to some of these messages ;)<br/>
&gt; Btw. Ive been playing my bard since april 2 1999. So he must qualify as an<br/>
&gt; old bard, hehe. Im just a casual player so Im still only 48th level, but<br/>
Ive<br/>
&gt; been on this list for a loonnnnggg time. I remember when the guy from<br/>
verant<br/>
&gt; and the tester roamed around. Those where the days with lots of good info<br/>
&gt; and communications bards around norrath, forgotten their names though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Musiker, bertox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
J. M. Capozzi, I saw his name recently, he&#39;s part of the live team on<br/>
Luclin.  (He wasn&#39;t with Verant officially when he posted to this list,<br/>
but had some inside dope.)<br/>
<br/>
Probably thinking of John Kim as well, he runs pretty rigorous tests.<br/>
He&#39;s still on the Concert Hall, last I checked. </span></blockquote></div>
