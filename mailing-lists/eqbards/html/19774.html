<b>Subject:</b> Scorpion Stingers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-672933672">Last night I logged in with my newbie Iksar Monk (Level 3) and was <br/>
killing scorpions in the Field of Bone.  I killed 4 Scorpions (blue <br/>
con) and got two Stingers (wind instruments).  I am mentioning this <br/>
because I haven&#39;t heard anyone bring up the FoB scorpions, but I have <br/>
heard people talking about the scorpions in Overthere.  Someone was <br/>
asking about instruments in Kunark.  I was thinking that for those <br/>
bards playing in Kunark a lot.  This is probably a good place to <br/>
stock up on *flutes*.  Just offer some money to newbie Iksars to <br/>
bring you some.  I also haven&#39;t explored too much of this zone, but I <br/>
bet that there are more scorpions scattered about and probably real <br/>
easy to stock up on these.  Just thought I would mention this bit of <br/>
info ;)  <br/>
<br/>
I usually have tons of mino horns in the bank for corpse recovery and <br/>
I tend to destroy them once I am back to my corpse and collecting <br/>
lots of loot.<br/>
