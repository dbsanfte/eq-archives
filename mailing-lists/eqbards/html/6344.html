<div id="ygrps-yiv-135029904">One thing that pains me more then anything is to see a Bard that ONLY uses <br/>
bellow in combat :(  I have been spending time in High Keep for the last few <br/>
levels, and when I see a message flash across my screen showing a bard just <br/>
bellowing his/her heart out I wince.  When I am not in my regular group I <br/>
always explain the tactics I will be using with something like this:<br/>
Tonight&#39;s song list consists of the following in regular combat: Anthem &#39;de <br/>
Arms (boast str, atk speed), Psalm of warth (grp damage shield and AC), <br/>
chains (slow atk spd and snare).  Do not snare or root unless I call for it.<br/>
<br/>
Then a second one saying:<br/>
If a gob is glowing red and I am not attacking leave it alone I mesmirizing <br/>
it.  If I call out charming so and so, I have charmed that gob.<br/>
<br/>
Many groups I have been in are amazed that one- I do not use bellow :), two- <br/>
that I can keep three song effects going.<br/>
<br/>
But for the life of me I can not understand why they whine so much when I <br/>
say good night, lol.<br/>
