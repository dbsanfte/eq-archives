<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749240362">Ahh well the problem here and why I usually ignore most low levels<br/>
complaints not because your low level but because you usally don&#39;t have the<br/>
info. Every class goes through weak period and overall a level 50 bard is<br/>
extremly powerful and a great group member. I also play a level 50 necro and<br/>
I guaruntee you every class has it weak points. I almost quit my necro at<br/>
level 34 because they go through a extremly weak period at 30-43. Onec they<br/>
hit 44 they get pretty good and by 49 they become the most powerful solo<br/>
class in the game which is what was promised for the necro class. Bards on<br/>
the otherhand are not supposed to be great at any one thing they are the<br/>
jack of all trades and in the end they can do a bit of everything.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I find this uninformed. We are perhaps the most versatile class in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; game. People that can find nothing but faults in their class make me<br/>
&gt;&gt; think one thought - you are playing the wrong class. We have so many<br/>
&gt;&gt; ways at our disposal to do almost anything, it&#39;s truely terrifying.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Dodge is capped at 125 for a reason - a bard is not a tank. This is also<br/>
&gt;&gt; why we don&#39;t get bash, parry, or double attack. When dodge caps at L24<br/>
&gt;&gt; you already should have begun occupying roles in your party other than<br/>
&gt;&gt; tank. Just look at how a bard solo&#39;s in the 40+ range to see how true<br/>
&gt;&gt; this is. Do you tank a blue or higher monster to kill it? of course not.<br/>
&gt;&gt; You use charm or chains and fear as two possible options.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, even if you are not the tank, songs move you up on the agro list<br/>
&gt;*every* time they pulse.<br/>
&gt;So, not a tank, just a punching bag.  With no way of defending ourselves.<br/>
&gt;BTW, I&#39;m only 20th, but i&#39;ve observed this quite a bit.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; If you aren&#39;t able to effective employ Lullaby, or it seems ineffectual,<br/>
&gt;&gt; ask constructively how others use it in this forum. Personally when I<br/>
&gt;&gt; solo, if there is any chance I&#39;ll fight a caster, Lullaby is memm&#39;d. It<br/>
&gt;&gt; may very well be mem&#39;d while I am grouped as well. There is nothing like<br/>
&gt;&gt; repeatedly interrupting a jin frogluk shaman attempting to cast heal to<br/>
&gt;&gt; make your group immediately value your presence.<br/>
&gt;umm...how about :<br/>
&gt;mob nods, mob smacks the crap out of you.<br/>
&gt;mob nods, mob stuns you.<br/>
&gt;start lullaby<br/>
&gt;mob nods, mob smacks the crap out of you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While fighting, solo, either melee or caster, in the Karanas and Lake Rathe<br/>
&gt;area, at level 19th, and 20th, I NEVER saw a mob interrupted in the least<br/>

&gt;This song is so completely useless at 20th, that I have unmemmed it.  It<br/>
&gt;only get&#39;s me killed, does not interrupt either melee or casters.  The<br/>

&gt;&gt; Pixie chase not useful?<br/>
&gt;&gt; i&#39;ve watched a bard hold a bok ghoul knight in place for 2 minutes while<br/>
&gt;&gt; the other 5 in the group fought and killed a second bok and the ghoul<br/>
&gt;&gt; lord. Many of our songs at the level we get them are very weak, but<br/>
&gt;&gt; unlike most classes, whose spells have damage caps, our songs continue<br/>
&gt;&gt; to increase in power without limit. A L50 Bard is truely one of the most<br/>
&gt;&gt; formidable and broad-spectrumed options to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wouldn&#39;t know - been playing since day two of release, and am still only<br/>
&gt;20th level.  I guess I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t try to powerlevel up, so I could<br/>
&gt;have actually used some of the songs before they nerfed them to<br/>
