<b>Subject:</b> Newbie Bard needs hunting suggestions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-805804474">Well, okay, his player isn&#39;t a newbie, but this is my &quot;I Am Not A Twink&quot;<br/>
newbie, now level 10.<br/>
<br/>
After finding that on the weekends people were more likely to make the trip<br/>
to town to sell their own excess loot than to sell it to me at zone, I<br/>
decided it was time to don all my purchases and go hunting. I really didn&#39;t<br/>
want my reports of what Newbie Bard had to be bragging so I won&#39;t keep<br/>
including the list, but it is startling, Tszaaz never ever had it so good.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I left Crushbone at 9, feeling like I had really had the<br/>
pre-Lego experience and not wanting to go through the middle part where<br/>
cents are green and legos are mostly red. I set up shop in Misty thicket for<br/>
all of 9, but as no one in Rivervale will let me do quests I am out of that<br/>
smarmy little podunk berg. I have decided I *like* dungeons a bit more than<br/>
open area hunting and so I am wrestling with what to do next. Here are my<br/>
initial thoughts on where to take him, exp being more the focus than money<br/>
and fun eclipsing both of those. I would appreciate any new suggestions or<br/>
comments on my initial plans.<br/>
<br/>
10-12 Blackburrow <br/>
(I know it inside out and it is a great dungeon for bards) <br/>
<br/>
12-15 Kurns Tower <br/>
(which means dropping lots of silver, but all those warriors are going to<br/>
love being hasted)<br/>
<br/>
15-20 Unrest <br/>
(I never hunted there before as my previous computer couldn&#39;t handle it)<br/>
<br/>
20-25 Lake of Ill Omen <br/>
(I took Tszaaz from 25-30 there, it might get tedious, might not)<br/>
<br/>
I am not feeling particularly inspired by this list however. If anyone has<br/>
suggestions for when, as a bard, to go where I would appreciate it. As a<br/>
start, I see I am leaving out Warslik&#39;s Woods and the Swamp of Ho Hope.  The<br/>
Iksar bandit caves should probably be in there somewhere...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in Advance,<br/>
<br/>

P.S. I started posting a &quot;Bards Tip of the Day&quot; in GFays OOC channel<br/>
whenever I logged in, it was fun, and good for other classes to see as well<br/>
*smile*. One day I listed the four songs you can solo with from 20-38 (DDD,<br/>
CoD, Largos, Hymn, all instrument) and got a tell from a bard who had just<br/>
hit 20 and was really excited to learn about it. I was glad my new world had<br/>
one more all instrument bard *smile*<br/>
