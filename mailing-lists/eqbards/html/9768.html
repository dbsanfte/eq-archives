&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe there is a skill-check involved in foraging the new special food<br/>
&gt; (like crocodile eggs, mushrooms, sea salt, sylvian berries, glowing lich,<br/>
&gt; etc), but I&#39;m trying to figure out what it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I have a few questions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Bards max at 40 foraging, right?<br/>
&gt; 2. At what level do you usually reach 40 skill foraging?<br/>
&gt; 3. Have any of you bards managed to forage something other than berries,<br/>
&gt; fruit, rabbit meat, roots, veggies and water? And at what skill level did<br/>
&gt; you get it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone know about druids? (Like, if you have a druid, what is his skill cap<br/>
&gt; and has he found any of the items, etc)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My druid never saw any of the special food until around 99 skill.<br/>
