bard as well. Unfortunately you can&#39;t confirm that at the moment as that<br/>
screen shot seems to have somehow got crosslinked to the coral trident<br/>
shot on the site.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Color choice, like everything else, is highly subjective. Personally I<br/>
would have liked a black plate chest to go with my Rubi pants, then I<br/>
could have passed my chest on to our Rogue, who hasn&#39;t had the good<br/>
fortune to find one and can&#39;t wear plate at all. Our cleric is in a<br/>
mixture of Black and Red and it looks just great.<br/>
