I have spent considerable time in kaesora, and I can tell you exaclty how to<br/>
crack the library and the xalgoz areas with small parties.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me where you died and the levels and classes of your guild/group and I<br/>
can come up with an extraction plan for ya.<br/>

Subject: Re: [eqbards] Kaesora trouble<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last night we (my bard and his guild) were on a guild raid of Kaesora.<br/>
Things were going great,  when my ISP decided it was time to crash.<br/>
<br/>
So now I am camped in the middle of a dangerous room with no chance of<br/>
running out.  My guild is unlikely to be able to muster up enough force to<br/>
get there anytime soon (we are small, we needed outside help getting this<br/>
far).  So what can i do?  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
