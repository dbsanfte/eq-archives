<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331384366">The only problem I have with all this talk is making the quest armor no<br/>
drop.  There are many of the quests for other classes I can do for those in<br/>
my guild.  They don&#39;t do them because they can&#39;t travel as fast as I can and<br/>
they don&#39;t enjoy questing and travelling like I do.  They are willing to<br/>
trade me things they camp for (Yech I hate camping) when I do get them a<br/>
piece of quest armor.  They could have gotten the armor themselves in most<br/>
cases but are not interesting in all the running around.  If all the quest<br/>
armor was no drop that would just be another set of quests I could do but<br/>
then have to just destroy the results.  At the cost of those pieces I<br/>
couldn&#39;t afford to do that and there would suddenly be no reason to do it<br/>
either.  as stated before by others unless you make everything no drop,<br/>
there&#39;s not much point in making a lot of things no drop.  There&#39;s nothing I<br/>
hate more than doing a quest which I often have spent hours, or days, or<br/>
even levels, (off and on) completing, only to be rewarded with a really cool<br/>
item for another class, that I can&#39;t even give or sell to someone else<br/>
because it is no drop.  I still have a Collar of Neshika in the bank from<br/>
doing the tiger quest hoping to get something to trade to a monk friend who<br/>
has an obsidian shard in the bank I could use, only to find out its no drop.<br/>
Believe me, that feeling is every bit as big a let down as seeing some twink<br/>
half your level run by with better stuff.<br/>
