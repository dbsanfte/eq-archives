 </span></blockquote>Excellent point Slyde. I noticed that even this mail list isn&#39;t very secure <br/>
in that it does not mask your IP address that you sent your email from. If <br/>
you send email from the same computer you play Everquest on, and use a <br/>
client like Microsoft Outlook (or Eudora), then it&#39;s quite likely you are <br/>
broadcasting your IP address (kinda like I am, but this isn&#39;t my home <br/>
computer).<br/>
<br/>
Once someone has your IP address, they can try all sorts of attacks and try <br/>
to sniff out your password, unless you have a firewall. Are we paranoid yet?</div>
