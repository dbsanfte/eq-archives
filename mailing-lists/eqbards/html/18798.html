<div id="ygrps-yiv-785638639">i&#39;ve never used forage nor complained about a low cap.  and i hate the<br/>
effects on the legs and boots =)  level 25 is &quot;nifty&quot; to get something like<br/>
this.  level 53 to get these is completely useless.  a warrior getting<br/>
invisibility at level 53 however is something they would absolutely DIE for.<br/>
all 51+ bards already have to deal with a majority of useless songs above<br/>
50.  now we have to deal with useless effects on the majority of our armor.<br/>
and still i play my bard and love my bard.  and i&#39;ve never bashed verant or<br/>
complained about class balance.  but i won&#39;t make up excuses to justify<br/>
these effects being worth anything.  it&#39;s like a bad joke.  sorry i am at<br/>
work and cranky, no offense.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Everyone seems to be using Summon Food and Drink as the prime <br/>
&gt; examples of<br/>
&gt; uselessness.  Well aren&#39;t we the class that has been <br/>
&gt; complaining rather<br/>
&gt; loudly for over a year that our forage was capped so darned low?  Well<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t we?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warrior Greaves cast Invisibility.  That&#39;s cool, but we have <br/>
&gt; a song for that<br/>
&gt; guys.  Think about it, we *don&#39;t* have songs that can summon <br/>
&gt; food and drink.<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s kinda nifty, but I will admit that I hope the BP <br/>
&gt; casts Gate.<br/>
