&gt;Lower guk off ghoul lord, level 47 or 48, has 2 harm touches about 480dmg<br/>
&gt;each, 2 level 45 to 46 guards. Need minimum 6 level 45 to 50 players with<br/>
&gt;enchanter or 10 to 12 level 45 to 50 without enchanter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nah, we have taken the lord with a lvl 50 wiz, 50 war, 44 war, 48 cleric,<br/>
me (was 44 bard at the time), and 49 wiz. The two high lvl nukers pretty<br/>
much ate the lord up quickly and then the two boks that where left where<br/>
easy prey. well not easy but we did it :). However, if the guk knight would<br/>
have spawned, we probably wouldnt have even attempted it. However, an<br/>
enchanter of lvl 45+ just makes this a whole heckuva lot easier, and you<br/>
really cant go wrong with two groups :)</div>
