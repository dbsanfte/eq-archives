Sounds like you are pretty well equipped in armor and weapons.  Although, I<br/>
would suggest that you review your bronze armor and look at the weight to AC<br/>
ratio of each piece - iirc, some give lots more ac per pound that others.<br/>
Making those &#39;others&#39; key candidates for replacement with things that may<br/>
have a touch less ac but perhaps some other stats (dex+, mr+, etc.)  If I<br/>
were you, I would be looking for jewelry and other items with magic<br/>
resistance, poison resistance (snakes are good from your level thru 13-15<br/>
iicr), or strength.  Level is God, AC is King & Resist items are you best<br/>
friends. Buffs are very nice too :)  There are also the &#39;classic&#39; bard<br/>
things: elf hide gloves, troll hide belt, mask of the deceiver (you are too<br/>
young to fight for one but might be able to loot one if you brave the depths<br/>
of Upper and Lower Guk - the Mask comes from a mid 30&#39;s camp.  Just some<br/>
thoughts.  Keep us posted on your progress.<br/>

&gt; Hello fellow Bards!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to the list and I would like to say that it is wonderful the<br/>
&gt; information that is shared among the bards of EQ. I am a lvl 11 Bard on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Karana server and I need some information please.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My question is this....what kind of armor, weapons, and instruments would<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; worthy of investment for me at this point?<br/>
