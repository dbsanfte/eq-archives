<br/>
I have only 80 strength.  I won&#39;t wear plate because it is too heavy (unless I find<br/>
a way to radically enhance my strength).  I would wear plate if I could.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think a rule change is in order.  Nobody is forcing anyone to wear plate.  I have<br/>
100 Charisma and 100 Dex.  I like the decision I made, but I also realize that I<br/>
cannot solo this character at the level I am or in the future.  I can take a lot of<br/>
attacks and receive less damage than any of the tanks in my party.  I can&#39;t dish<br/>
out the damage they do, but it all works out well this way.<br/>
