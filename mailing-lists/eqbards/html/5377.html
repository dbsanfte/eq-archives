<div id="ygrps-yiv-867902397">Well, for me personally Unrest has been great for cash.  What I generally do<br/>
is spend about 4 hours there and leave with 3 FS weapons, a couple pieces of<br/>
bronze armor, some jade or other stones, some words, 1 rare drop like the<br/>
thick apron, or savants cap and about 10pp or so in coin.  I have 100STR and<br/>
I am not a monk so I can go right up to my weight limit, usually can carry<br/>
over 30units of weight worth of crap before I start to go over the limit and<br/>
notice adverse affects on my stats.<br/>
<br/>
I then go to Kelethin and sell the bronze for about 2pp per AC point, sell<br/>
the rare drop for what I can get for it (around 20pp) and then sell the FS<br/>
and misc loot to my bard guild who I am amiable with and I have a 110CHA.<br/>
At 3-6pp per FS weapon and 10-20 or so per bronze plus the rare drop plus<br/>
the cash coin I looted, I can make around 50pp - but don&#39;t get me wrong, I<br/>
do have to work for it...and it does take about 4 hours and some luck.  <br/>
<br/>
I am level 24 an I can only seem to maintain around 300 plat and I am still<br/>
in mostly banded armor and wielding a Dragoon dirk and a Pugius dagger so<br/>
I&#39;m not really bragging.<br/>

&gt; I think a lot of you people gushing about how easy it is to <br/>
&gt; make money via<br/>
&gt; loot are exaggerating.  I have a 23rd monk that works his <br/>
&gt; butt off and he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; never had more than about 125pp in the bank at any one time.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve spent time<br/>
&gt; in unrest.  Where&#39;s the money there?  FS weapons?  The cash <br/>
&gt; drops aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; *that* great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired <br/>
&gt; of reading about<br/>
&gt; how others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Aye, its all relative. Plats are very easy to get even <br/>
&gt; after level 20. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have never had less than 100 in the bank since then and <br/>
&gt; almost always over<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1000. Today I am buying Blk Pearl Plat earrings and will <br/>
&gt; have up to 1000 to<br/>
&gt; &gt; blow on failures and if they all fail the only thing thats <br/>
&gt; a pain is getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4 more BPs to play with. Replacing the 1000 is really easy. <br/>
&gt; This is why I<br/>
&gt; &gt; love the bazaars, I trade basically useless Plats for <br/>
&gt; awesome items I or my<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends can actually use, what a great concept.<br/>
