<div id="ygrps-yiv-68891961">1) yes, singing any song will break your invis to undead. However, singing<br/>
invis isn&#39;t strictly necessary. there are few live mobs on the dead side,<br/>
and in the case of most (bats, bugs) they see through invis anyway. As for<br/>
the invis song interacting with caster invis, this seems to change with the<br/>
week. Sometimes it works no problem in my group, sometimes it causes huge<br/>
problems. At this point, we seem to have given up on caster invis. Bard<br/>
invis is much easier...<br/>
   a) it never drops at the wrong time (being refreshed every 6 seconds is a<br/>
good thing)<br/>
   b) inherant see invis<br/>
   c) forces party to go slow, so party sticks together<br/>
   d) doesn&#39;t waste caster&#39;s mana or spell slot<br/>
   e) takes 3 seconds to get the whole party invised, vs 6 casts of regular<br/>
invis.<br/>
<br/>
2) my experience has shown that you can have invis and invis to undead at<br/>
the same time, although the order is important. I think you need to cast<br/>
invis first, then invis to undead. However, this was about 20 levels ago, so<br/>
things may have changed recently.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You can get invis to undead potions to supplement your invis or go with<br/>
&gt;someone who can cast it.  Or go with someone who can revive you<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um. 1) If you are singing a song, doesn&#39;t casting any sort of<br/>
invisibility on you get canceled by the next pulse of the song?<br/>
(The Invisibility is canceled, the icon stays up. Windsong&#39;s been<br/>
killed by someone with invisibility walking through her song radius,<br/>
then out again, blissfully thinking he was invis, and he wasn&#39;t. The<br/>
resulting<br/>
train killed both him and her)<br/>
<br/>
(And no, you can&#39;t have both Invisibility and Invisibility to Undead<br/>
cast on you by someone else. The spells overwrite each other. Only one<br/>
is allowed)<br/>
