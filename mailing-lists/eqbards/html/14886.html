<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952827424">I managed to get into the Lord group on sunday, after begging I could<br/>
handle it (I was level 37) and that it was only the day before that I spent<br/>
the whole day camping the magi. The leader agreed and upon arriving to the<br/>
Lord group I realised I knew 3 of the people there very well. All former<br/>
guild mates so I knew I was in good hands.<br/>
<br/>
I was already dual wielding Yaks after some fine fortune on friday evening,<br/>
I offered my sharkjaw Cutlass for a Yak and the guy accepted. I was so<br/>
pleased, no I deal out a modest amount of dmg.<br/>
<br/>
Spent 8 hours at the Lord camp sunday, made 2 bubs exp and hit level 38<br/>
(yet another useless song). Only died once and that was because the Lord<br/>
was too hard. Wiped all but 2 of us out (they gated out). Another group<br/>
watched us die and didn&#39;t help, hoping they would get the kill but our<br/>
cleric was bound next to the Lord room and managed to get the exp for us.<br/>
In total we saw 2 Yaks and 6 SSB&#39;s. I lost every single roll &lt;sigh&gt; I never<br/>
rolled higher than a 62, what is wrong with me???<br/>
<br/>
Spent 10 hours in magi on saturday and he only spawned twice (no smr). Made<br/>
3 bubs here.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good weekend for me, I made 5 bubs exp total, and got my second<br/>
Yak. I am so pleased.<br/>

&gt;you forgot the most important thing... which looks better?  what other<br/>
&gt;considerations are there? =)  and wouldn&#39;t ykesha camping be more like mid<br/>
&gt;40s?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The key question<br/>
&gt;&gt; is that by the time I can camp for Ykeshas (late 30s/early<br/>
&gt;&gt; 40s), will the +9<br/>
&gt;&gt; DEX increase the number of procs by enough to outweigh the<br/>
&gt;&gt; benefit of having<br/>
&gt;&gt; +5 to all resist rates?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Whats a good price if I decide to sell the Exe Hood?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks<br/>
