me asks me what i wanted for my hero bracer (im auctioning it because i have<br/>
a spare)  then after a wee bit says oh nm, i thought you were a twink and<br/>
not a real player.  Talk about kicking me while im down.<br/>

Sickening, isn&#39;t it?  I dinged into 35 earlier this week and made a b-line<br/>
for Kelethin to train in Tracking (sunk 38 points into it... brilliant<br/>
skill).  While I was in the neighbourhood, I paid a visit to Mr. D&#39;Vinn to<br/>
give him my regards and relieve him of his Dirk.<br/>
<br/>
I was in the tower, looking out one of the windows when I see a Bard in full<br/>
Lambent on the receiving end of a sound spanking from a Centurion.  A quick<br/>
/who bard showed him as level 7.  Nothing new there; it happens all the<br/>
time.  I&#39;m not bitter, cos, you know, I *worked* for my Lambent and didn&#39;t<br/>
buy a single piece... grumble.<br/>
<br/>
I hop down from the tower to give him a hand and someone shouts out &quot;OMG!<br/>
Two bard twinks in the zone. Don&#39;t expect us to save your asses.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
?!!<br/>
<br/>
I later had to save this fellow&#39;s hide when he pulled an almighty train to<br/>
the zone, but I&#39;ll continue that in Kitasi&#39;s thread...<br/>
