<b>Subject:</b> Dragoon Dirk, Shiny Brass Shield and Crush&#39;s tunic <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-744369417">These 3 itmes seem to be bardic items to me! The dirk (light and fast)<br/>
Crushes tunic (AC12, +8 magic fire and cold resist and only 4 pounds or<br/>
so) and the SBS, great shield before you have dual wield! (ac10, +10<br/>
magic resist and light). <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to mention that the Tunic and Shield are now officially LORE<br/>
items, meaning you may only possess one (including if you have one in<br/>
bank!). I believe the Dirk has been one for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what i was getting to, in CrushBone today, there was someone<br/>
soloing crush and dvinn and LEAVING the itmes on the corpses! then he<br/>
would shout &quot;Come get Dvinn&#39;s dagger for free&quot; &quot;Come get crush&#39;s tunic<br/>
for free&quot;. This was happenning on the innoruk server. so, if you are in<br/>
need of these items, take a stroll over to CB, maybe you will get lucky.<br/>
<br/>
(I had already bought both the tunic and dirk, at retail value :( )<br/>
