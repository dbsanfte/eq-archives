&gt;   Still, saying that a wizard is much harder, when the wizards<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve started all say low difficulty seems to contradict your<br/>
&gt;   opinion (in the designer&#39;s mind).  The wizard has two goals in life:<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   1) Stay alive.<br/>
&gt;   2) Nuke the crap out of things.<br/>

&gt;   Wizards have no technicalities to deal with, no decisions to<br/>
&gt;   make on the fly.  They wait til X mob is at a certain health <br/>

options, that there are only a narrow range of situations<br/>
where they can really do well.  Bards and enchanters OTOH are<br/>
so flexible they can (given enough intelligence) usually turn<br/>
any situation into their favor.  It boils down to what you<br/>
mean by &quot;difficult.&quot;  Do you enjoy solving problems with just<br/>
a few tools, or do you enjoy having a wide assortment of weak<br/>
tools and puzzling over which will work best to solve the<br/>
problem at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, one could argue that not-so-intelligent players<br/>
would prefer the few-tools approach since it involves fewer<br/>
permutations per situation.<br/>
