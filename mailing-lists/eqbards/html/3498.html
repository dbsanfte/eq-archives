<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340662067">Ok, so after all the stuff I&#39;ve read about Kithicor.... you got me scared. <br/>
<br/>
Mind you, whenever I passed through Kithicor Forest before, I was scared ANYWAY. I always equipped the drum, and Selo&#39;d my way to the other side as quick as possible. That zone just seems a little DARKER than other zones, a little QUIETER than other zones... indeed, it seems quite a bit more spookier than other zones.<br/>
<br/>
One time, a friend of my had the &quot;dicon while zoning&quot; bug, and though he was disconnected, the server thought he was still logged on. He zoned and, unknownst to him, walked right into the lake in Kithicor. Well, of course, by the time he logged back in, he had drowned. HOWEVER, he didn&#39;t KNOW where his body was since it was on the bottom of this lake.<br/>
<br/>
Sending me a tell, his best-bardic-buddy, he BEGGED me for help to find his corpse. I sped to the zone, rehearsed my Corpse song, and he followed me... and he kept telling me how he had eerie feelings just BEING in this zone. He SWORE he saw something he thought looked like a werewolf speeding by, but why it didn&#39;t up and eat his naked self, he didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the song led me to the lake&#39;s edge. The dark waters were calm, silent, still, as if a pool of black oil. My friend gave me consent, and said he&#39;d PAY me to go in and get his stuff. I laughed (which of course he can&#39;t hear through the screen) and said sure, but no payment was needed. He consented me, and I swam out. He was a good ways in, and his body was on the bottom. Throwing up the Aquatic Ayre, I got his stuff and came back to shore. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think about it until later, but from the time I entered Kithicor to the time I left, I did not SEE one single critter. No beetle. No bat. No nothing. He told me that he thought the zone was &quot;haunted&quot; in more ways than one. At the time, I laughed, thinking that he was taking the game a little too seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Now, after hearing other stories from fellow bards, I realize he could very well be right.<br/>
<br/>
3 cheers for Kithicor, the &quot;Loch Ness&quot; of EQ!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    How about that music that sometimes comes on throughout the zone, must be a random trigger though cause I never get it in the same place twice...  I actually find unrest scarier though, in a frenetic, bodies everywhere sort of way.  Ok, I lied, Kithicor is way scarier, but only when you let yourself think about it...<br/>
<br/>
            Knowing how Brad thinks in some ways, it would make a lot of sense.  Kithicor is the physical &#39;glue&#39; that hold the two sides of Norrath together, not HighPass as some might think.  Perhaps Kithicor is also the metaphysical &#39;glue&#39; that holds different parts of Norrath&#39;s story together.  HighPass is the &#39;obvious&#39; center, the one everyone sees.  But you can go around Highpass, how can it be more than a false center, a side passage in the tale of Norrath.  No the real center, the shadow-center is Kithicor.  Its not Commonlands, nor Karanas.  You can&#39;t avoid it, but must pass thru whether to go b Rivervale or HighPass you must take Kithicor.  Most run thru it quickly, without looking back.</div>
