This Druid one is also a 50 Monk ... he probably plans to FD after casting<br/>
the shield.<br/>
Its kind of funny.  I play with lots of twinks, and they always complain<br/>
about &quot;Noobs&quot; but I find it amusing that we die at least as much.  Sure, we<br/>
know how to assist and often deal better with multiple mobs and know the<br/>
zones better on average, but its also hard (like I said earlier) to convice<br/>
a high level warrior&#39;s caster twink that he needs to run at half health.<br/>
Or, better yet, watching a caster&#39;s warrior twink run around screaming &quot;Mob<br/>
on Me.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Hmm, I&#39;ll have to test this out.  I think that if you are shielded before<br/>
&gt; the mob is engaged, it doesn&#39;t count, but my druid always shields me after<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve pulled and it seems to do quite a bit of taunt.   But I will check it<br/>

Yes, if your druid casts it after the mob is engaged, then<br/>
it&#39;s a taunt.  But then so is every other song/spell.  Smart<br/>
druids and mages (the ones who like to live) cast it just<br/>
before the fight.  :)<br/>
