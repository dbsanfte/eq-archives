<b>Subject:</b> RE: something about slow vs. fast weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-820693887"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;OTOH, say you have a high blue that you predictably cannot<br/>
&gt;defeat using fast weapons.  If you switch to slower ones, you<br/>
&gt;increase your chance of beating it.  If you start to lose, you<br/>
&gt;can always hit Accelerando (or Screech underground) and zone.<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s what I meant about it on average making no difference.<br/>
&gt;Any &quot;benefit&quot; you can think of for faster weapons because the<br/>
&gt;chance-of-less-damage end of the bell curve is smaller, is<br/>
&gt;matched by a equal &quot;drawback&quot; because the chance-of-more-dam<br/>
&gt;end of the bell curve is likewise smaller.  Factor in that the<br/>
&gt;system rewards more experience for riskier fights and the<br/>
&gt;decision to side with the easy and predictable fights is notso clear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Based on the numbers we have, i would tend to agree with John that over time,<br/>
the difference between slow and fast weapons (with the same ratio)is<br/>
insignificant, because that is what the damage/delay ratio tells us, as to how<br/>
much damage a weapon does per second.  <br/>
<br/>
But, the only part of this i disagree with is the rewards for taking risks<br/>
system.  i don&#39;t know that it is necessarily 100% accurate.  Mine i think is<br/>
the case example.  for 8 levels, i have been in North Karana Kiting/Meleeing<br/>
beetles (Pincer, Borer, Scythe).  At level 18, the Scythe Beetles gave me 3<br/>
possible cons (Blue, white, yellow) and they only range 17,18,19.  Because we<br/>
have no HARD NUMERICAL DATA on XP (boy, would i love to see some), it is very<br/>
difficult to tell, but i was watching my XP bar very closely (as i had nothing<br/>
better to do).  Not only did i get the same XP from the Blue, White, or yellow,<br/>
but the Borer beetles (14-16 lvl range) would usually (probably the 15&#39;s and<br/>
16&#39;s) would give me the SAME xp.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, i think specifically for bards (especially if soloing) it is important<br/>
to play the averages and try to cut out as much variability and deviation as<br/>
possible.  We miss A LOT! With a big damage, slow delay weapon, some of my<br/>
*safe* fights would be deadly.  I use a Mithril Quill and A Dragoon Dirk (4/19,<br/>
6/23).  As I have noticed that i can accumulate more XP by reducing downtime<br/>
and fighting as many of the *safe* fights as i can [ie-not taking any big<br/>
risks], I really NEED to know that the random number generator is not going to<br/>
bite me too hard.  This may change for me as i get higher level and actually<br/>
start grouping with my friends : ).<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, i am not a powergamer just level crunching to 50, but i have<br/>
been powerleveling to catch my friends (who are 24-26 and waiting for me).<br/>
I abandoned my cleric because bards are far more entertaining.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
