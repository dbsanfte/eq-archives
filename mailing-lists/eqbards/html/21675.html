<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-42622323">Actually Kit, I remember a long time ago (6 months or so ago) that when I <br/>
wandered into the jail, the 2 mobs on the left seemed to be able to run <br/>
out, and just the 1 on the right was chained. I admit I was surprised <br/>
recently when I found all 3 of them chained. I was trying to find the board <br/>
where someone posted that all 3 couldn&#39;t move. All jail hunters I know on <br/>
Bertox already knew this and were blasting away at the cornered mobs. As a <br/>
matter of fact, 1 warrior who I was teamed with wanted me to ensure that 2 <br/>
melee mobs were left before I left, so that he could just fight the 1 spawn <br/>
in the cell by himself.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t stopped by there recently, let me know when was the last time you <br/>
were through there and what server you were on, maybe that makes the <br/>
difference?<br/>
