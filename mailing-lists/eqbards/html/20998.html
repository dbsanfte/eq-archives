&gt; I haven&#39;t been under a rock. (although it may have been safer there, maybe I<br/>
&gt; should try it) I&#39;ve seen and contributed to many of the posts. But when I<br/>
&gt; read Abashi&#39;s reply, I honestly believe he has absolutely no idea what we<br/>
&gt; are talking about when we reference the problems with chains and lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s a real problem then.  On the recently-wiped Gameplay board, there are 10 <br/>
separate posts with the words &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;snare&quot; in the titles which discuss the nerf to <br/>
the level 23 song, and 13 separate posts with the words &quot;lullaby&quot; or &quot;mez&quot; in the title <br/>
which discuss the problem with Lullaby and Pixie Strike.  This doesn&#39;t mention all the <br/>
other threads that discuss these topics that do not have the words in the title.<br/>
<br/>
HOW COULD HE NOT KNOW?  Isn&#39;t it his JOB to know?  Isn&#39;t he supposed to read at LEAST the <br/>
first post in a new thread?  Or does he just notice the word &quot;bard&quot; in the title and blow <br/>
it off?  I work a full-time job, and I STILL know what most of the major issues are that <br/>
are bothering other players of ALL types, not just bards.  Two months ago he tells us that <br/>
Chains should not have been nerfed, and now he has no idea what we&#39;re talking about?  He <br/>
thinks that maybe someone somewhere mentioned in passing that Lullaby is just fine, so that <br/>
makes it OK?  I&#39;m apoplectic.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like talking to a freaking rock.<br/>
