There&#39;s a quest to return a purity belt stolen by the pirates<br/>
one island over.  They are L15-19ish from what I saw, but<br/>
grouped.  Probably shouldn&#39;t attempt it with a full group in<br/>
their 20s (since you can&#39;t run to a zone in the OOT).  Instead<br/>
of returning the belt to complete the quest, you could always<br/>
keep it.  Talk to the head Sister of Erollisi.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it is kind of silly that they put the item on L10 mobs<br/>
for evil folks, but L18 mobs for good folks.  Wish Verant<br/>
would put full suits of plate on all those dark elf ancilles<br/>
and dragoons I see in Mistmoore, West Commonlands, and<br/>
Nektulos.  :-)<br/>
