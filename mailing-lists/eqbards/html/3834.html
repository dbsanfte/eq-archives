<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514947995">There is no easy fix for this that I know of, UNLESS you are using a weapon<br/>
that can also be used as a ranged weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Once I bought a Dirk, which can be a ranged weapon, I have no problems with<br/>
my inventory buttons.<br/>
<br/>
These are my buttons:<br/>
Melee Weapon spot 1:<br/>
Melee Weapon spot 2:<br/>
Ranged Weapon spot:<br/>
Invventory 1:<br/>
Inventory 2:<br/>
<br/>
So when I want to switch, I move the Dirk from my hand to the Ranged Weapon<br/>
spot, then I switch my shield with the instrument I want to play.  I don&#39;t<br/>
need an empty inventory spot.<br/>

&gt;Subject: instrument switching and inventory<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When playing my new bard, I took a common suggestion I heard of making<br/>
&gt;hotkeys for the two melee slots and several (four) invetory slots. I have<br/>
&gt;bags/boxes in my other four slots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This makes it very easy to switch instruments/weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wondering, is there any trick to keeping those inventory slots open<br/>
&gt;(i.e. free of random loot) without manually having to put every item into<br/>
&gt;a bag? I bought a mandolin and horn to fill 2 more slots, but there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;still 1 empty slot (which needs to stay empty, so when I swap out 1<br/>
&gt;instrument, there&#39;s room for a shield + weapon). Anytime I look anything<br/>
&gt;it gets automatically dropped into that slot, which is very annoying when<br/>
&gt;trying to switch weapons later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hopefully there&#39;s some good tips out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks, =)<br/>
