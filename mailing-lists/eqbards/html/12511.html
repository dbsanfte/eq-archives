<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788472258"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Its just a bug with the way quests work.  If you don&#39;t give the items in<br/>
&gt; the &quot;correct&quot; order, you see odd messages like that.  (Note: You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; still get your prize, but you&#39;ll also get odd messages)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I think each item is presented to the NPC, one at a time, until<br/>
  all items are accounted for.  If you only give the NPC one item<br/>
  it will give its, &#39;Oops&#39; message.  It is definitely a bug, a bug<br/>
  in the NPC item parser.  Each time the NPC sees the next item, it<br/>
  gives it&#39;s little Oops message.  At the very end, it then looks<br/>
  at the collective group of items to determine correctness.<br/>
<br/>
  In the Pit of Doom in Halas, you can turn in 3 gnoll teeth for<br/>
  a faction adjust and coin.  Those items are identical, yet she<br/>
  still says... Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?  Each time, until<br/>
  the last tooth triggers the correct amount switch.<br/>
