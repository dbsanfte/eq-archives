<div id="ygrps-yiv-49829240">Actually, clerics have more options than just healing. So do wizards (though<br/>
to a smaller extent)<br/>
Clerics have Quite good stuns that sometimes it is worth taking another look<br/>
at.<br/>
<br/>
The most important skills to learn, IMHO, are how to be a good group member.<br/>
Everything else can be taught. If you&#39;re willing to listen, to die, and to<br/>
stay and help recover corpses.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Powerleveling anyone can be easily done with a higher (lvl 24 spells I<br/>
&gt;&gt; think) druid. They just buff you up some, especially getting their<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage shield, then heal you while you fight reds.  My friend shot up<br/>
&gt;&gt; his guildmate from 8-12 in a few hours...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  My point is with a bard you dont just click one button to do something.<br/>
&gt;  Powerleveling a bard is useless, if they dont know what they are doing.<br/>
&gt;  Most bards I see don&#39;t know what they are doing anyway.  (ie: bellow)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  With clerics, it&#39;s easy - they heal.  With wizards, it&#39;s easy - the<br/>
&gt;  blast.  Powerleveling a class who has to adapt and think is much more<br/>
&gt;  difficult, which was the thing I was getting at. </span></blockquote></div>
