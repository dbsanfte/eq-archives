<div id="ygrps-yiv-21773769">This happens a lot in our guild too.  The pressure gets to me too quite<br/>
often.  Its funny how people tell me &quot;oh you&#39;re in an &#39;uber&#39; guild you must<br/>
get all sorts of loot&quot; or &quot;oh how fun to go on big raids every night!&quot;   I<br/>
guess the grass is always greener because there are nights where I would<br/>
kill to play an alt but can&#39;t due to guild policy and needs.  Its truly a<br/>
different game.  &quot;Fun&quot; becomes something you look forward to having once in<br/>
a while.  Hmm maybe I need a break.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Aye without participation we could not kill the things we <br/>
&gt; want to kill.  I<br/>
&gt; had become a casual player, or even less, so that is one <br/>
&gt; reason I decided to<br/>
&gt; go.  Casual players can get loot, but it is only going to be <br/>
&gt; after everyone<br/>
&gt; else has what they want, and if you are lucky enough that the <br/>
&gt; mob you want<br/>
&gt; something off is still being killed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think I would have been kicked out or anything, but I <br/>
&gt; also wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; contributing anymore.  Most of the guild plays every night or <br/>
&gt; at least 6<br/>
&gt; nights a week from 5:30pm on.  Recently it was asked (or <br/>
&gt; ordered, however<br/>
&gt; you want to see it hehe) that every member attend at least 1 <br/>
&gt; raid per week,<br/>
&gt; which isn&#39;t much to ask at all but I wasn&#39;t even doing that <br/>
&gt; much when I<br/>
&gt; quit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; I had seen one of your previous posts a long time ago on this <br/>
&gt; &gt; subject, but <br/>
&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t find it. A very involved system. I&#39;m guessing that <br/>
&gt; &gt; there aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; any casual gamers in Afterlife, or if they are, they don&#39;t go <br/>
&gt; &gt; on raids or <br/>
&gt; &gt; if they do, they just know they will not get any loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It definitely slants rewards to the full time player: Keep up <br/>
&gt; &gt; or drop out.<br/>
