<div id="ygrps-yiv-132383813">Reminds me way back in the day again... my friend (wizard) got charmed by<br/>
chief dunga (ogre camp) in wkarana... he when charmed was in the middle of<br/>
the ogre camp.  Would have been a very tough CR back in those days.   He was<br/>
fortunate enough to have shadowstep memmed. He kept bashing it and finally<br/>
charm let go, was getting pounded, shadowstepped out of there and quickly<br/>
gated out with minimal health left...<br/>
<br/>
From that day on he steered clear of them<br/>
<br/>
I used to love getting charmed by EE&#39;s when we were killing them, however<br/>
getting charmed by the noble in solb is not as funny, even less funny when<br/>
you think about your friend thats an ogre warrior of level 60 next to you,<br/>
you pray to god that he doesnt get charmed.<br/>

Heheh Evil Eyes are EVIL!!!! (how appropriate)<br/>
<br/>
Way back in the day, I was playing my troll warrior, and got charm by an EE<br/>
in E Karana (I was looking for merchants I could use).  I swear the bugger<br/>
kept me charmed for about 20 minutes before killing me!!!  I have never been<br/>
so scared in all my life.  I thought I would never get free...<br/>
