<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941380519">You know, that&#39;s odd.  I&#39;ve been hearing all these bad things about ME, but<br/>
I bought the upgrade, and haven&#39;t had a problem at all.  I&#39;m running a<br/>
Celeron 533 w/ a Voodoo 3 card, SBlive and 320MB of ram.<br/>
<br/>
About ME, I just made sure and d/led all the updates whenever they come<br/>
out.<br/>

I would recommend that, under no circumstance, &quot;upgrade&quot; to ME!!  I have<br/>
heard more bad than good about it.  Your best bet, for a gaming machine, is<br/>
Windows98 Second Edition.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine bought a new machine with ME on it.  It was plagued with<br/>
random, unexplained blue screens and other crashes.  He reformatted with<br/>
Win98SE over a month ago, and has not had one single blue screen or random<br/>
crash since then.<br/>

 I use a PIII 800 with 256 Meg of Ram and  GForce II with 32 meg of video<br/>
memory.<br/>
I can do three songs with ease -- barring lag which gets pretty heavy at<br/>
times in Europe -- even with an adsl connection.  4 songs are managable<br/>
under really good circumstances with, as some others have mentioned, a bit<br/>
of drop off at the end...<br/>
on guild raids with six groups fighting in close proximity, twisting more<br/>
than two songs is tough, but managable.<br/>
SOmebody mentioned that Win98 is a poor memorymanager and I must agree --<br/>
Can anybody comment on Win ME doing a better job of this?  If upgrading to<br/>
ME will help me twist songs better, I&#39;ll do it in a heartbeat.<br/>

because of the same problem, frame rate.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
know what was going to give me what I wanted.  So I played hit and miss.<br/>
Months back I went from 128 meg of PC100 memory to 256 PC100.  I didn&#39;t get<br/>
any noticeable improvement.  I replaced my 300a Celeron (overclocked to<br/>
450) with a P3 700 three weeks ago (fastest chip the mobo will take).<br/>
There was a huge improvement in frame rate.  I can keep my clipping plane<br/>
maxed in burning woods and still have a _nearly_ flicker free run.  I fact<br/>
I did auto-follow through there a few days ago with out a problem.<br/>
However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  If I turn the<br/>
clipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent trade off<br/>
in viewable distance and twisting time.  Right now I feel the TNT card is<br/>
holding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming out later in<br/>
the year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.  To what I don&#39;t<br/>
know yet, depends on the prices and Verant&#39;s recommendations.<br/>
