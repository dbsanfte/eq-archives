<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113816660"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, my company uses the internet, but doesn&#39;t do internet-based work, so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this permutation didn&#39;t occur<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to me.  1)  My company has more than enough internet security stuff on our<br/>
 </span></blockquote>network to prevent me from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; running EQ altogether; 2) when we work on proprietary or secure data<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and/or systems, we do it on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stand-alone machines and transmit the information on cd-roms via courier;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>3) for the same reason, I have a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stand-alone machine in my own home.  Plus, I never play EQ with any other<br/>
 </span></blockquote>processes running.  Yeah, I&#39;m a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dinosaur.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehehe.  I don&#39;t either but the potential is there.  I have, in the past,<br/>
forgotten to turn off my email client or my word application before I launch<br/>
EQ.  My system is sufficiently powerful (PIII 550 w/384mb RAM, I use 256 meg<br/>
of ram as a RAMDRIVE which I have my windows swap file set to ;) ) that if I<br/>
leave applications running in the background they don&#39;t hinder EQ.  I don&#39;t<br/>
play EQ at work.  I think those who do should be shot.  Or at least fired so<br/>
I Can get their job ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that the reasons they wanted to pull the data up were to:  1) have proof<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if they chose to ban a player and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) give them the ability to review the data to make sure that they weren&#39;t<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; number of clients they have, the number of machines that are running EQ at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a given time, and a whole slew<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of practical resource limits, I couldn&#39;t pulling much of anything up, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>even if it contained something<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that perhaps it shouldn&#39;t have, they wouldn&#39;t have the ability to<br/>

<br/>
Nope, they could very easily have the client shutdown with a message to the<br/>
player to please call Customer Support at Verant.  Verant could then work<br/>
with the customer to get them back online if they were locked out by<br/>
mistake...  Having the client shut down when the signature they&#39;re looking<br/>
for is found is sufficient &quot;proof&quot; for them to lock a customer from the<br/>
game.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Since the point is moot, I&#39;m really just wrestling with the philosophical<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and technical implications<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here.  I&#39;m not disagreeing with you, just trying to get a handle on this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Technically what they did was take the easy way out (big surprise).<br/>
Philosophically they broke a lot of common moral values held by people world<br/>
wide.  Not to mention really freaked security experts out.  Legally they<br/>
broke the California Penal Code (someone posted the relevent sections on the<br/>
EverQuest message boards, I&#39;m not a lawyer (evidently this guy was)).<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that an earlier message summed it up nicely:  They probably got a<br/>
Cease and Desist order from the courts.</div>
