		It sure would be nice to have some more magic instruments in<br/>
the game. After<br/>
		much consideration my Most Desired Magic Instrument (tm)<br/>
would be a regular<br/>
		ol&#39; drum...but one that sticks with you when you die. You<br/>
awaken in the<br/>
		Arena, naked to the world, with 3 or so zones to<br/>
cross...wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
		wonderful to have that drum sitting there in your inventory?<br/>
No, we can&#39;t<br/>
		bind, and I am happy with that, but at EXACTLY the time you<br/>
could really<br/>
		leverage your abilities to lessen the pain, blah, no drum.<br/>
Sure, I keep one<br/>
		in the bank for when I am bound to a city,  but often zoning<br/>
to the bank to<br/>
		get it is just not what I have patience for after dying...<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
		one born of making level 18 five times this weekend :o)<br/>
