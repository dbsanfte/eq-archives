<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] grouping thread on the Everquest boards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523681298">You&#39;ll love this part, the group of friends that made the comments lately<br/>
are a totally different group.  The original ones now seem perfectly<br/>
comfortable with my bard and his contribution.  Of course now we regularly<br/>
have at least 2 good tanks (ranger, monk, or warrior).  Basically the melee<br/>
guys love having me around, it mostly the true casters that think bards<br/>
don&#39;t pull their weight.  The clerics and druids have never complained, its<br/>
the enchanters, necros, etc.  In part they are right.  In a caster heavy<br/>
group with an enchanter there isn&#39;t much I can do without making the<br/>
enchanter totally change his strategy from mezzing to stunning or something.<br/>
Of course they seem to have no problem with the fact that I have to change<br/>
my strategy every group I&#39;m in according to the group I&#39;m in&#39;s membership.<br/>
<br/>
Basically though you are correct.  The SolA group was almost always no<br/>
tanks.  Since they realized they needed tanks, they suggested someone ought<br/>
to play a warrior.  It was implied sometimes that that someone should be<br/>
someone who was trying to tank anyhow and wasn&#39;t really all that important<br/>
to the group&#39;s success, ie the bard.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we have plenty of tanks the group likes having me around.  They see<br/>
that a bard can be versatile to handle just about any kind of bad situation<br/>
that occurs except one that requires someone to soak up a lot of damage.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that I have basically given up on grouping with the enchanters.<br/>
It&#39;s nothing but a big headache.  There&#39;s really not a whole lot I can do if<br/>
my tanking is sub par and I can&#39;t use any songs that might awaken his mezzed<br/>
mobs.  So long as I can find a group that doesn&#39;t have enchanters in it I<br/>
can do very well.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to find a group without one and<br/>
that&#39;s when the suggestions begin.<br/>

Forgive me if I get this all wrong, my memory&#39;s not the best.  A while back<br/>
some bard was distressed because the group he was hunting with in one of the<br/>
Sols kept insisting that he tank.  When he tanked, he died.  When he refused<br/>
to tank, the others grouped without him claiming they could handled just as<br/>
many mobs without a bard as with one.  What&#39;s more his group suggested he<br/>
retire the bard and roll up a warrior so that he could tank without dieing.<br/>
Was that you, Kitasi?  My advice at the time was to get some new friends.<br/>
My advice now is to get some new friends.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
