<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044695213">the point was not that you would be feared or ae damaged or whatever.  the point<br/>
was that you would get the same effectivity at about 175 as at about 245.<br/>
<br/>
the way to test this is to have someone get to about 176 in resists and compare<br/>
effectivity with someone at 245 in resists.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand your question (soft cap? uber-guild conspiracy?) <br/>
&gt;but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have been on raids, very recently, and have seen first hand where <br/>
&gt;the bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; resist songs makes a significant difference.  And this is not a one <br/>
&gt;time<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has this soft cap on resists been confirmed?  Or are we just <br/>
&gt;relying <br/>
&gt; &gt; on this uberguild leader that may have a conspiracy against bards? <br/>
&gt; &gt; LOL!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Not true in my experience.  Bard songs that buff resists do still <br/>
&gt; &gt; make a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; difference.<br/>
