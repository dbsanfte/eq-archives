<div id="ygrps-yiv-884169549"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Also, here is my list of level 26 soling that I did with a mini-review of<br/>
&gt;each:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords, Dragnors Cauldron:<br/>
&gt;Total blast, need to use all instrument to win (at least I did with my<br/>
&gt;unprocing Staff of Writhing and 65 1HBlunt) you can also do Aqua Goblin<br/>
&gt;Bosons. Lots of room for AE, little danger of picking up greens that pose<br/>
&gt;any problem. Reasonable loot, good experience. I hunted between the Eldrich<br/>
&gt;Collective camp and the AquaGoblin camp and only twice had to bail into<br/>
&gt;Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Addendum:<br/>
I forgot that actually what I did was start the fight with weapons and if it<br/>
started going poorly I would switch to intruments. I was doing this to raise<br/>
1HBlunt. As a note to anyone starting out, using All Instrument Attack the<br/>
mob almost always pulls ahead at the start, then slowly I catch up and pass<br/>
them, so it can be tricky to know when you are winning, but you get a feel<br/>
for it, and of course it&#39;s different for runners than for stand-grounders.<br/>
