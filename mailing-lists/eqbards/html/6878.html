<div id="ygrps-yiv-156524683"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My understanding was that the only mobs in Perma that dropped bronze<br/>
&gt;were the elite guards at the back by the diplomat. At L19 I would have<br/>
&gt;thought that they might be a bit hard to reach, even with a full party.<br/>
&gt;Is this not the case? This dungeon wasn&#39;t even itemized until I was in<br/>
&gt;my 30&#39;s so I didn&#39;t get to play there much except for a trip to pick up<br/>
&gt;a crystalline blade and a couple of aborted Vox attempts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quick Explanation-I actually got the Breastplate from Perma with my cleric<br/>
(retired)  but before you jump to conclusions, my cleric (who is now lvl 20)<br/>
was level 19, in a group of 5 with a 20 Monk, 20 Ranger , 19 Shaman, and a 23<br/>
Druid.(my Wife and 3 people i work with)  The Ice Goblin Prelates (lvl23-25<br/>
approx ? ) also can drop Medium Bronze, but it is rare.  That is what we got<br/>
the Breastplate from.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They do, however, make a big difference, according to what I&#39;ve heard.<br/>
&gt;Wasn&#39;t it on this list where someone said they definately knew that<br/>
&gt;different armor types provided different protection, independent of the<br/>
&gt;AC value? I remember someone saying a Programmer GM had grabbed him or a<br/>
&gt;friend in beta and equipped him in various armor to test this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not sure on this (we are trying to run some tests, will let you know<br/>
soon!), as it is a hard thing to get empirical data. I have also heard lots of<br/>
rumors about &quot;Damage Absorption&quot; or other things, but I am skeptical of<br/>
anything that i cannot put a number on. But, based on the numbers that i DO<br/>
have, i would not give up my barbed arms (+2 Dex, ac of banded) for Bronze arms<br/>
(one point of AC).  That is not even including the extra 3 pounds or whatever<br/>
for the Bronze.  In fact, i am going to test tonight to see if Barbed Legs (ac<br/>
of banded, +2 AGI) are better/worse/same as Bronze.  <br/>
<br/>
I have deviated from my intended purpose...i wanted to say that in many cases<br/>
the availability of Med Bronze is lower at the same levels as small, it is not<br/>
IMPOSSIBLE to get at the same levels, and in some cases, there are better<br/>
things to get anyway (that are even easier to attain). (Keep in mind, this is<br/>
my opinion only)<br/>
But, yes, Med Bronze is more difficult to get than Small.  Large Bronze is even<br/>
easier to get than that (in Theory)<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
