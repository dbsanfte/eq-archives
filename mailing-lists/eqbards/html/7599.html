&gt; &gt; &gt; Bard & Wizard are fighting in lower Guk. Bard is bound in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Freeport while Wizard is bound in Innothule right outside<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Guk zone line. Bard & Wizard die. Bard runs through 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; zones, and does so naked with no weapon. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; No, bard sits and memorizes songs, finishes, clicks on &quot;Yes&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the resurrection prompt from the group&#39;s cleric.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; See what I mean about you picking worst-case scenarios?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If &quot;more likely to happen&quot; scenarios are your version of<br/>
&gt; &quot;worst-case&quot; then so be it. You&#39;re assuming that everyone<br/>
&gt; is of the high enough level to group with a level 29+<br/>
&gt; cleric. (Assuming such a level cleric is even available)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this whole thread is moot to any class that is under<br/>
level 12.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot point to L19+ wizards and druids teleporting around<br/>
in run-across-Norrath races (and for that matter, L12+ casters<br/>
binding themselves anywhere), and at the same time ignore L29+<br/>
wizards and druids and clerics being able to take non-binders<br/>
with them.  These things are all level dependent, and thus<br/>
&quot;moot to people that aren&#39;t of higher levels.&quot;  I agree with<br/>
you that it&#39;s bad that we have such stark level dependencies,<br/>
but that&#39;s the price you pay for using a level-based system.<br/>
