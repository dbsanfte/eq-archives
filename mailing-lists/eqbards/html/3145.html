slower...and you can also switch to walk...I know that sometimes I will walk<br/>
halfway through a zone with Selo&#39;s and a drum and not even realize that I am<br/>
walking - speed walking as it were...hmmm, all we need now is a shopping<br/>

&gt; Hail All,<br/>
&gt; I had to mention this to you since the discussion has turned <br/>
&gt; to barbarian <br/>
&gt; warriors. My guild has a high proportion of them so I spend <br/>
&gt; alot of time <br/>
&gt; &#39;heavy hauling&#39; them around, (Selo&#39;s has spoiled them all). I <br/>
&gt; am a wood elf <br/>
&gt; bard and my AGI is 103 with items currently so I am faster <br/>
&gt; than all the barb <br/>
&gt; warriors I know, even when they remove their BBC&#39;s. They <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t see very well <br/>
&gt; and often don&#39;t know how to get where we are going so getting <br/>
&gt; them to lead <br/>
&gt; is hard. They often get out of song range pretty fast. For my <br/>
&gt; latest trick, <br/>
&gt; I have discovered that I can run backwards and we stay <br/>
&gt; together! This always <br/>
&gt; earns me a &#39;pesky elfy&#39; comment as well! It gets laugh almost <br/>
&gt; every time! <br/>
&gt; This is useful in high lag where follow isn&#39;t doing well and <br/>
&gt; in &#39;safe&#39; areas <br/>
&gt; where you wont run into things that will immediately eat you. :)<br/>
