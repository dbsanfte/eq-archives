<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871247334">Yea I logged on this AM, downloaded all my email (Alot since I have been out<br/>
of the office for 5 days).  I start reading emails, when suddenly I am<br/>
getting spammed by virus replies.  I closed my connection and squashed the<br/>
bugger...  Its a mean little guy, sent out a bundle of mails in that 10 min<br/>
though...</div>
