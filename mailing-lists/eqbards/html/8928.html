Rhythms in favor of Purifying Rhythms.  The fear spell was bad<br/>
enough, but my party was being reamed by the DoTs (L38 bard<br/>
and ranger, L31 cleric).  Individually the mobs there are not<br/>
difficult, but the spawn time is 7 minutes, and just as you<br/>
finish up the last mob, the first one spawns again.  By the<br/>
time we finally got a small break, everyone was down to almost<br/>
one bubble and OOM.  Don&#39;t walk in there expecting it to be a<br/>
pushover because everything is green or blue.<br/>

At the high 30s, you resist his fear spell a lot, but he casts<br/>
it so often that eventually one gets through (even with me<br/>
playing Purifying Rhythms with a MM drum).  That leaves your<br/>
party one man down, which in a party of 2 or 3 is a tremendous<br/>
handicap.<br/>
