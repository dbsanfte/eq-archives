<b>Subject:</b> Fast Weapon <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571201409">I agree with the fast weapon people,  i am BRAND new (see my question<br/>
coming later) to bards but I was a reasonably high level warrior, so I<br/>
know a little about how weapons work...<br/>
<br/>
Basically I was experimenting with a Shiny Brass Halbred vs 2 combine<br/>
scimitars.  With the SBH  I had extremly random fights.  I would rip<br/>
through a mob one time and other times have to run from easy blues.  The<br/>
two combines allowed for very consistent damage streams.  I preferred<br/>
this (though I switch back and forth to keep my skills up), not to<br/>
mention two scimitars look really cool, as opposed to the dorky looking<br/>
halbred.  Another advantage of the fast weapons is increased spell<br/>
interuption, very nice...<br/>
