&gt;Armor class... It means that when you do get hit (which you will at a lower<br/>
&gt;level) you lose less HP every time... I also think it holds true even up to<br/>
&gt;higher levels.<br/>

looked to that as a model. AC was used as a modifier to the &quot;chance of <br/>
hitting roll&quot; not a damage modifier.The way the DM rationalized it to me <br/>
was thus &quot; When 2 beings are 2 feet away from each other, slashing or <br/>
poking at each other with sharp, pointy things, it is likely that each <br/>
attempt will hit. The roll we make to check for a &quot;damaging&quot; hit is to see <br/>
if you were struck in an unprotected area which would cause damage. If the <br/>
roll fails, it is assumed that the blow struck you in an area that was <br/>
sufficiently armoured to prevent damage.&quot; Hence, as your AC increased, the <br/>
chance of a damaging blow being landed dropped.<br/>
<br/>
         Of course, this may have absolutely no bearing on how it works on <br/>
EQ, but it was a good excuse to harken back to my youth. I thank you for <br/>
your consideration and bid you farewell.<br/>
