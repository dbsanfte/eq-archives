&gt;Oh a semi-unrelated note: I&#39;ve recently moved to very quick, light damage<br/>
&gt;weapons when I melee - combine dual wield with warsong or anthem you are<br/>
&gt;literally the tazmanian devil of meleeers.  I got to thinking however, how<br/>
&gt;does dual wield really work?  Someone speculated that its keyed off your<br/>
&gt;primary hand (every swing = chance for dual wield to go off as well).  This<br/>
&gt;would suggest getting something like a dirk in the primary and then a heavy<br/>
&gt;hitter/proc&#39;ing weapon in the offhand, since you could cheat the system in<br/>
&gt;affect if your heavy hitter had a chance to hit quicker than its normal<br/>
&gt;delay.  I haven&#39;t experimented, but can anyone elaborate on dual wield<br/>
&gt;stragies?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>

Here&#39;s a few hard numbers to chew on:<br/>
The actual formula for double attack is (SKILL+LEVEL)/500, with the integer <br/>
converted to a percentage.  50th level with 200 skill equals 250/500, with <br/>
..50 being the result.  50 percent chance to double attack. Monks cap at 250 <br/>
in DA, all other classes cap at 200. For dual wield, it&#39;s (SKILL+LEVEL)/600. <br/>
  50th level with 200 skill equals 40 percent.  Monks cap in Dual Wield at <br/>
250, and rogues cap at 210.  All other classes cap at 200.  Also, once dual <br/>
wield exceeds 149 in skill, checks are made to see if you double attack with <br/>
the secondary as well, provided you have double attack as a skill.  This <br/>
check is based on your dual wield skill, and its corresponding percentage <br/>
chance. [For those of you wondering why monks get such a bonus in DA/DW, <br/>
keep in mind that monk hand speed never drops below 30.  They need the <br/>
increased attacks to remain competitive with other melee classes who can use <br/>
faster weapons, weapons with proc effects, etc.]<br/>
I&#39;m not going to bore you all to tears with all the charting and the <br/>
formulae used, Monte Carlo simulations, how the fixed damage bonuses due to <br/>
strength, offense and weapons skills seriously skew the results in favor of <br/>
speed, and about half a dozen other variables.  Most of those numbers are <br/>
intentionally and forever hidden from the end users view. Suffice it to say <br/>
with two weapons of a given efficiency, the faster will always win out in <br/>
terms of real damage in any time period beyond 30 seconds. And, the faster <br/>
the weapon is (while maintaining the same eff. rating), the wider the gap in <br/>
damage results between it and the slower weapon.<br/>
Here&#39;s an example: Using round numbers here, and mythical weapons, both with <br/>
a .25 efficiency rating, a 5 dam/20 delay and a 10dam/40 delay weapon.  All <br/>
results assume a 50th level player, with 200 in all his combat skills, and <br/>
100 STR. The 5 dam/20 delay  weapon will outperform a 10dam/40 delay weapon <br/>
by about 27 percent in a two minute time period, in the primary.  If you <br/>
have double attack, it goes up to 44 percent, thanks to double the amount of <br/>
DA activation checks. It will outperform by 39 percent if used in the <br/>
secondary, mainly thanks to twice as many DW activation checks. If your <br/>
class is capable of &#39;quad&#39; attacks (see above),  it goes up to a staggering <br/>
73 percent overall spread between the faster and the slower weapons.<br/>
Now, this is an extreme example, most real world weapons aren&#39;t that <br/>
polarized.  But you can still expect a marked advantage over the faster <br/>
weapon.  Enough of an advantage to even sacrifice some small amount of <br/>
efficiency in favor of speed.  A well balanced scimitar, (5 dam/21 delay, <br/>
..238 eff rating), outdoes a barbed leather whip,( 7 dam/28 delay, .25 eff <br/>
rating), by 14 percent in a two minute period used as the primary, and 19 <br/>
percent as the secondary. At 50th level, in pure melee combat, two minutes <br/>
is pretty close to how long a typical fight lasts.  Drop the time period <br/>
down to one minute, the gap narrows, but is still evident.  Drop it down to <br/>
30 seconds, it&#39;s a dead heat, still.  Anything less than 30 seconds tends to <br/>
favor the whip. You can run this trend down all the way to 17th level for a <br/>
bard, and the corresponding skill levels, the spread remains the same for <br/>
primary weapons, and reaches it&#39;s narrowest point with secondary, but it&#39;s <br/>
still within 10 percent of the peak spread. This, by the way, totally <br/>
disregards the target&#39;s defense, assuming a randomized hit with every swing. <br/>
  If you factor in the highly variable factors of target defense and AC, <br/>
first you go nuts, then you come up with results even more in favor of the <br/>
faster weapon, as you get more chances to hit as well.<br/>
There are some cases, though,  where the raw damage numbers DO matter. <br/>
Fighting mobs with damage shields(druids, fire elementals, etc), it&#39;s best <br/>
to use a slower, heavier damage weapon, to minimize the damage YOU take. For <br/>
a  Rogue, your backstab damage is predicated on the amount of normal melee <br/>
damage you can inflict with one hit, as backstab is simply a fixed <br/>
multiplier(based on skill and level) on a normally resolved pierce attack. <br/>
Higher the base number, the bigger the backstab. If you take a look at the <br/>
good 2h weapons, you&#39;ll find they are generally *much* more efficient than a <br/>
1h weapon, by as much as 100 percent. They HAVE to be, to make up for being <br/>
so much slower than the 1h counterparts, and to compete with dual wield.  2h <br/>
weapons, especially 2h slash, are purpose designed to be the most efficient <br/>
weapons in the game. They don&#39;t break the above results, at all, but the <br/>
natural efficiency brings the curve around again, offsetting reduced attack <br/>
chances.<br/>
