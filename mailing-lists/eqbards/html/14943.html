&gt; After about an hour maybe not quite, the path and most of the castle was<br/>
&gt; cleared.  Groups started moving in and camping rooms. Pretty soon, there was<br/>
&gt; a shortage of stuff to pull.  Well, kind of a shortage.  One SK goes &quot;can I<br/>
&gt; pull the rest of the castle here?&quot; (We were in the main foyer/ballroom?)<br/>
&gt; Hehe, since nobody screamed &quot;OMG NO!!!!&quot;  He did.  We had a castle pull -<br/>
&gt; classic MM style.  There were by later count 17 mobs pulled into the melee.<br/>

train is the stairway gargoyles (2), mobs before the ballroom<br/>
(4), mobs in the alcoves to the left and right of the ballroom<br/>
(5), mobs in the upper level of the ballroom (4), gypsies in<br/>
the ballroom (4), gargoyles behind the negotiator room (4)<br/>
mobs in the negotiator room (6 or 7), and anything that&#39;s on<br/>
the plateau and castle entrance (8).  That&#39;s 37 mobs, plus<br/>
pets.  If the pit isn&#39;t camped, add in 5 more by the time the<br/>
train reaches the zone.<br/>
