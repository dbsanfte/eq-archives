&gt; well, the outcome in 99.9% of the fights is the same, i (and my group) win.<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; a while last night our monk was linkdead.  we continued fighting.  the outcome<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; the same every time (we won).  does that mean that monk melee is meaningless?<br/>
&gt; and what about the 90% of the population who don&#39;t get to 55 and don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; cantana?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The perception of effectiveness is what I&#39;m talking about, not the absolute<br/>
effectiveness. You could &quot;enchance&quot; the group by chain casting invigor from<br/>
your vambraces all night, but it wouldn&#39;t be much fun.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; totally untrue.  i was in karnors last night and pulling skeletal berserkers<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; curates and sentries of sathir and the ever present dogs.  group was wiz, me,<br/>
&gt; warrior, warrior, warrior, monk.  we did non stop pulls.  got singles or<br/>
&gt; doubles<br/>
&gt; every time (i was doing the pulling since it&#39;s more considerate to lament the<br/>
&gt; mobs on the way back than feigning them onto the other group fighting while<br/>
&gt; feign splitting).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Camping the front quarter of karnors is not what I&#39;m talking about when I<br/>
say &quot;getting things done&quot;. I&#39;m speaking of going deep into the higher level<br/>
dungeons. Take that karnors group and head off into the back castle and<br/>
explore it. Then tell me you were as capable as a balanced group of equal<br/>
level.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; ok so tell THEM about it.  posting it on this list does not get it to THEM.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have a point. Never-ending complaining is irritating. I think part of<br/>
the idea is that people are trying to build support for this point-of-view.<br/>
A logical way to do that is to communicate with people who are likely to<br/>
share the same view as you do. At some point it becomes moot. So, take<br/>
heart, that point is nearly here.</div>
