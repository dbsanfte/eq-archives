&gt; 3.  The really destabilizing part of this is not Bind Affinity in and of<br/>
&gt; itself, but is Bind combined with Gate.  This combination permits<br/>
&gt; spellcasters to escape combat far more readily than any melee type<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While this may sound nice in theory, I have been grouping with many,<br/>
many different combinations of people from L6 to L49 and I can count on<br/>
one hand the number of times a caster has made it out of a situation<br/>
where all the meleer&#39;s have died by gating. Unless the caster in<br/>
question specializes in alteration their chance to get a gate off with<br/>
multiple mobs beating on them when things go bad is about nil. And<br/>
casters that gate out at the first sign of trouble don&#39;t get invited<br/>
back into groups very often.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, in the middle levels (20&#39;s to 40&#39;s), in my experience it is the<br/>
casters who generally are the first to die in these situations and the<br/>
tanks who generally make it to the zone line. The only time I&#39;ve seen<br/>
your theory actually in practice is in the 40&#39;s when in dungeons like<br/>
lower guk where your only way out is group gate, where our cleric will<br/>
usually cast gate himself while the rest of the group is calling for a<br/>
group gate, and if group gate fails, I&#39;d much prefer the cleric live and<br/>
be in full armor for the corpse recovery anyway.<br/>
