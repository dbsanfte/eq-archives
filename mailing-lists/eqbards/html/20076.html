&gt;   - WOW *dreams of a lag free connection to the us* I guess <br/>
&gt; that makes me a<br/>
&gt; crappy bard because I can do two songs?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh, chalk me up as mediocre, I can only do 3.  But that&#39;s not nearly so<br/>
embarrassing as trying to follow a druid around and having her cast SoW on<br/>
me because I couldn&#39;t keep up with Selo&#39;s & a drum.  (SoW didn&#39;t help of<br/>
course, but at least in seeing it didn&#39;t work she didn&#39;t think less of our<br/>
class) <br/>
