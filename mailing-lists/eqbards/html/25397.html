<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124253968">I don&#39;t think it blocks them.  But DS is pretty insignificant.  By that<br/>
I mean during those 3 minutes of Puretone, 1 rogue would have doubled<br/>
(or more) the damage of the DS you created.  Overall if the whole raid<br/>
is DS&#39;d, like with the diamonds, it is free damage.  If a bard is<br/>
singing DS, they are not singing something else (yes I would be singing<br/>
Rondo too of course for the DS and ATK with epic), and again if they lag<br/>
or die the DS is gone.  Sure the intent is to keep that rogue or that<br/>
bard alive, if the rogue dies he is doing no damage.  But all things<br/>
being equal, if you do keep both alive, the rogue has doubled or tripled<br/>
the damage the bard contributed with DS.<br/>
<br/>
I understand you will not always have the equipment or people you want<br/>
or need, I am just talking best case scenario, the most efficient way to<br/>
kill what you are after.<br/>

BTW, does the VP Mage Staff block Rondo or Psalms?  If not, isn&#39;t <br/>
more DS always better??<br/>
