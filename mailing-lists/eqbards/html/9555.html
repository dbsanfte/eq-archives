<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003004461">Yes, I noticed this yesterday. I just made 18 and tried out DDD for the<br/>
first time. I actually blew into the correct end (small end). Now I&#39;m<br/>
finally ready to perfect the DDD/CoD/Hymn combo.<br/>
<br/>
Also, using a tip from the experts here, I trained my brass skill to max in<br/>
the Shady Swashbuckler cave in the tunnel from E Commons to N Ro. Woke up<br/>
this morning, scrolled up the messages and saw I was maxed at 95! I think<br/>
this is almost as safe as the Arena for uninterrupted instrument training.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a huge THANK YOU to Harmonic Distortion for letting me tag along<br/>
yesterday. I&#39;ve got a ton of screenshots of him killing Froon and Choon with<br/>
Charm (I added my _hefty_ melee skills to help finish off the winner &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
He also saved my bardic butt with chain/fear when I got Froon on me before<br/>
we were ready. I now have the two Runes from these beasties in the bank<br/>
waiting for the day when I&#39;m ready to pursue the rest of the lambent quest<br/>
items. Thanks also for the equipment, Harmonic!<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t seen anyone say anything about this, but the<br/>
&gt; brass horn animation is now fixed.  I was happily<br/>
&gt; surprised when I went into &quot;3D&quot; view and noticed it =)<br/>
