&gt;Personally with the success rate of bard&#39;s foraging I find it much<br/>
&gt;easier to just buy milk and muffins. Plus they don&#39;t weigh as much or<br/>
&gt;take up as many inventory slots as the 5 varieties of foraged food.<br/>

and muffins every once in a while, but normally only because I sat idle for<br/>
a long time and ate through my stores ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ahh - that explains the problem.  I&#39;m lucky enough that I had a backup of<br/>
my EQ files when my hard drive crashed the other day.  I never changed my<br/>
bound keys, so I have left and right as &#39;A&#39; and &#39;D&#39; respectively.<br/>
Conveniently, this is also what user defined 5 and 6 are set to.  I have<br/>
sense heading on one, and forage on the other.  Life&#39;s good for da bard ;)<br/>
(I also have &quot;Corpse&quot; set to User 5 and 6 in bank 5 for when I&#39;m trying to<br/>
do a speed corpse retrieval)<br/>
<br/>
This brings me to an interesting point.  It was never announced *why* they<br/>
changed the bind, my assumption was to stop people who were using the<br/>
method I just described to keep their sense heading and other skills like<br/>
it maxed.  However, I have to counter that with logic from two directions:<br/>
First, it neither compromises game balance NOR exploits something where the<br/>
player is not taking risk, yet making gains. (the primary argument against<br/>
kiting)<br/>
Second, it actually makes sense to be &quot;sensing heading&quot; while moving.  The<br/>
only reason it&#39;s not bound to the forward key is that I realized that I<br/>
might not want to lock that key down with something else.  It also makes<br/>
sense to be foraging while moving - since foraging is not just &quot;digging&quot;,<br/>
it&#39;s also spotting those berries in the underbrush, or what have you.  Of<br/>
course, I&#39;m still concerned about the mysterious rabbits that seem to leave<br/>
pieces of themselves all over the place....<br/>
