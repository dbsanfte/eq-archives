<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228941128">Geez, I&#39;m impressed. I know the main reason I avoided trying to swap so much hardware, was because they didn&#39;t have the &quot;no drop&quot; option at that time. Nothing more infuriating that dropping your mandolin in the middle of the karanas just because you clicked on the little space between your inventory boxes on your hot keys. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;m getting tired just reading what you&#39;re going through. I&#39;m sure the mobs get confused (she&#39;s attacking me with a sword, no a lute, no a drum, curse her!)<br/>
<br/>
You do get more bang for your buck with this combination, but for me, it&#39;d just be way too much work. Besides, at a younger level you&#39;re still plenty good with a sword to be considered a melee class. Do you find you takedown mobs faster with your Kung Fu Instrument/Weapon attack than if you just twisted Warsong/Hymn/Chords?<br/>

&gt; So I&#39;m the only bard who actually swaps instruments and weapons fairly<br/>
&gt; regularly?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For what it&#39;s worth, here are the two ways I do this.  (btw, I&#39;m level 13)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hotkey bank #2<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anthem          Hymn<br/>
&gt; off-hand          CoD<br/>
&gt; El Rhythm    Bellow<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Either the lute or the drum is equipped and the other&#39;s on the cursor which<br/>
&gt; is kept over the off-hand hotkey.  The battle would start with something<br/>
&gt; like ER, Anthem, equip lute, CoD, equip drum, rinse, repeat.  The battle<br/>
&gt; would end with something like Hymn, Bellow, Anthem all with the lute<br/>
&gt; equiped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Swapping weapons to instruments & back again is something I only do when<br/>
&gt; soloing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hotkey bank #1<br/>
&gt; prime hand     off hand - lute<br/>
&gt; inv 1 - sword    inv2 - drum<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shield is on cursor<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hotkey bank #5<br/>
&gt; Warsong     Hymn<br/>
&gt; Selos            CoD<br/>
&gt; El Rhythm   Bellow<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I use these banks to switch from a CoD/Hymn/Bellow with lute combo (what I<br/>
&gt; start the fight with) to a Warsong/Bellow/Hymn combo with sword and sheild<br/>
&gt; (what I switch to when chasing a fleeing mob) to a Selo&#39;s/Hymn with drum<br/>
&gt; combo (for getting back to safety).  I change to sword and sheild between<br/>
&gt; Warsong and Bellow and change to drum after hitting Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But then what do I know I&#39;m only level 13.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Peace<br/>
