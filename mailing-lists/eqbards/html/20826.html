&gt;Lol! C&#39;mon admit it. You&#39;re really a professional cup holder installer for<br/>
&gt;these things and tell people where to download the &quot;nosmoke.exe&quot; patch. :-)<br/>

&gt;Oh I wish someone would post that nosmoke.exe joke again.<br/>
&gt;Anyone still have it?<br/>

<br/>
I used to work in a computer store and one day we had a gentleman call in <br/>
with a smoking power supply. The service representative was having a bit of <br/>
trouble convincing this guy that he had a hardware problem.<br/>
<br/>
Service Rep: Sir, something has burned within your power supply.<br/>
<br/>
Customer: I bet that there is some command that I can put into the <br/>
AUTOEXEC.BAT file that will take care of this.<br/>
<br/>
Service Rep: There is nothing that software can do to help you with this <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Customer: I know that there is something I can put in... some command... <br/>
maybe it should go into the CONFIG.SYS.<br/>
<br/>
[After a few minutes of going round and round]<br/>
<br/>
Service Rep: Okay, I am not supposed to tell anyone this but there is a <br/>
hidden command in some versions of DOS that you can use. I want you to edit <br/>
your AUTOEXEC.BAT and add the last line as C:&#92;DOS&#92;NOSMOKE and reboot your <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
[Customer does this]<br/>
<br/>
Customer: It is still smoking.<br/>
<br/>
Service Rep: I guess you&#39;ll need to call Microsoft and ask them for a patch <br/>
for the NOSMOKE.EXE.<br/>
<br/>
[The customer then hung up. We thought that we had heard the last of this <br/>
guy. But NO; he calls back four hours later!]<br/>
<br/>
Service Rep: Hello, Sir, how is your computer?<br/>
<br/>
Customer: I called Microsoft and they said that my power supply is <br/>
incompatible with their NOSMOKE.EXE and that I need to get a new one. I was <br/>
wondering when I can have that done and how much it will cost....</div>
