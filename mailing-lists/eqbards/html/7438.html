 </span></blockquote>exactly, way too much of a pain and way too complex.  there are and must be<br/>
penalties to dying: loss of experience and returning to bind point.  a<br/>
couple months into final release, there was a decision made to reduce<br/>
drastically the amount of experience loss when dying, but keeping the<br/>
binding policy in place.  i would vote for this any day of the week, and i<br/>
assume it was this or change the binding policy and keep the experience loss<br/>
the same.  above level 30 every death was approximately TWO BUBBLES of<br/>
experience.  i lose about 25% of that now, and trust me that has saved me a<br/>
hell of a lot more time just running back to my group instead of having to<br/>
rebuild that experience.  anyway, i can not foresee changing my view on<br/>
binding.  and my two highest level characters can not bind.  the only<br/>
trouble i ever had getting bound was in the first week when no one could<br/>
(hehe my friend was the first person on our server to reach level 12 who<br/>
could bind which was cool).  it is a pain to die, as it should be.  no one<br/>
likes it.  the ability to bind is reserved by a few classes, and it is part<br/>
of the choice on what class you want to play.<br/>
