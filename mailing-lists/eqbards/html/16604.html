<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462617359">You didn&#39;t add the idea of the Random Evac song that quite a few people<br/>
liked the idea of:<br/>
<br/>
Niv&#39;s Chords of Dispersion<br/>
Level:  45th/49th??<br/>
Skill:  Stringed<br/>
Description:  This is an evac song that is different to wizard/druid evacs.<br/>
The songs only effects party members in the zone and has a 3 second casting<br/>
time, once evaced the group will be distributed around Norrath at various<br/>
wizard/druid gates. The bard could end up in Gtr Fay and the Warrior in<br/>
North Karana. The song also uses 150-200 mana per cast (stops the use of<br/>
random porting for solo bards). This would be an nice addition to the bards<br/>
songs giving them a personal evac (might reduce bard deaths) aswell as a<br/>
group evac for big emergencies (evacer OOM). With only a 3 second casting<br/>
time it is better than the wizard/druid line of evacs but the random<br/>
dispersion of the group means that it is for serious emergencies only.<br/>
<br/>
* - My original idea was to just teleport the entire group to 1 random<br/>
teleporter. Making it disperse the group members individually to random<br/>
teleporters may make Verant consider this highly. I also think it will be<br/>
great for solo bards that run into trouble (running from a wizard train in<br/>
L Guk, down to 1 bub health - EVAC (while on the move). Oh dear, I am in<br/>
butcherblock (guess it&#39;s better than being dead).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
From: Tork &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tdomeii@...">tdomeii@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On to a compendium of ideas.  I am not making any judgements on them, but<br/>
I did take the liberty of combining similar ideas and/or taking the most<br/>
well written version of an idea and posting that.  I will attribute all<br/>
song ideas to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqbards@onelist.com">eqbards@onelist.com</a> unless you explicitly email me<br/>
(privately if you want, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gww6e@...">gww6e@...</a>) to say otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
My comments are marked with a *.<br/>
<br/>
1. Party Bind<br/>
We did not want a bind song if it was identical to casters, however if the<br/>
song allowed you to bind anyone anyplace (melees included) then with spell<br/>
reagent costs and mana tolls, we would certainly welcome it, especially at<br/>
higher (51+) levels since expansion zones are rumored to be mammoth in<br/>
scale.<br/>
<br/>
2. Upgrade to Clouding (was: Party invis vs undead)<br/>
An upgrade to Clouding that combined invis, invis vs undead and sneak<br/>
(meaning no spell graphic) since this would give us an ability no single<br/>
caster can provide (both invis types) and the no spell graphic would be a<br/>
boon to +PvP servers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. Upgraded charm.  Everyone and his brother (over 35 responses) wanted<br/>
this and hey, I do too. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. Upgrade to clouding.  Nuff said, and I think I summed it up that we&#39;d<br/>
like a song that can provide both types of invis.<br/>
*duplicated and deprecated by 2, I?m going to remove it. -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5. An improved damage shield.  This appears to be drawing interest:<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Sonic Reflection<br/>
Brass<br/>
Gives all party members a damage reflection shield.  Causing a portion of<br/>
the damage done to them in combat (melee & non-melee) to be reflected back<br/>
at the attacker).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6. An improved AE DoT with added effect (stamina drain being a common<br/>
thread, the other was a lifetap affect).  Question at large: do mobs have<br/>
stamina and if so, does it impact their ability to fight?<br/>
<br/>
*More work is needed here. -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7. Upgrade to selo&#39;s OR remove hard speed cap.<br/>
*I personally want the cap removed vice burning another spell slot on an<br/>
upgrade. -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8. Upgrade to clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Cassandra&#39;s Clarified Elegy<br/>
Provides clarity2 (whatever that might be) + (limited?) elegy effect.<br/>
<br/>
*Is this warranted? -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9. Upgrade to MR debuffing abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Fog of War. AE snare. AE slow attack speed. AE Dot. AE magic<br/>
debuff (30 pts at least). effect of fog?<br/>
<br/>
*I like where this is going, anyone want to help fill in the blanks? -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10. One-way teleport (self only?  to bard guild?).<br/>
*superseded by Call to Arms, number 17.  I will remove this unless there<br/>
is debate otherwise. ?Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
11. Mem blur song.<br/>
<br/>
Fitful&#39;s Forgetful Improv<br/>
Voice<br/>
Causes the target to become so fixated on the improv that it forgets<br/>
whatever else it was dong.  Drawback: Bard possibly left on hate list.<br/>
<br/>
*No further discussion on this?  Given how powerful mobs are going to be,<br/>
perhaps make it AE and not break mez? -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
12. Upgraded Atk Song<br/>
Since we are out speed buffed by enchanters, a straight addition to Atk<br/>
with an added component.  Most commonly heard suggestion: rune type<br/>
shielding.  Other suggestions: massive ac bonus, massive regeneration<br/>
effect, massive MR buff.<br/>
<br/>
*Definitely more ideas needed here.  We all know we need and deserve a<br/>
song like this and we all know we?re gonna get some VoV upgrade.  Let?s<br/>
help steer GZ and company in the right direction. -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
13. A proc song<br/>
The Chromatic Scale<br/>
Level: 36th<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Description: A chromatic scale is all the notes an instrument is capable<br/>
of producing, generally played starting from the lowest to the highest and<br/>
then back down; slurred up (ligato), tongued down (staccato).  The<br/>
Chromatic Scale when song by the bard would act much as the Vampiric<br/>
Embrace necro spell in that it imparts a proc to melee attacks however the<br/>
twist is that there would be 5 different types which randomly kick off:<br/>
magic, fire, cold, disease and poison based attacks. These would be DD&#39;s -<br/>
there by filling in our missing DD ability, but in a uniquely bard fashion<br/>
(group based, becomes more powerful as you add members and err... randomly<br/>
good -- maybe. hehe).  Verant of course would come up with some cute<br/>
little chromatic sparkles to surround us and multi colored blasts as the<br/>
proc goes off. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
14. A bard additive song<br/>
Cinda&#39;s Companion Cantata<br/>
Level: 49th+<br/>
Skill: Variable (see below)<br/>
Description: A cantata is a composition scored for many parts at once,<br/>
incorporating both voice and instrumental accompaniment, hence this song<br/>
would allow bards in the same group to ally their voices in song to<br/>
intensify the effects of a common song ? to &quot;stack&quot; the same song, perhaps<br/>
with at 100*(2-((6-n)^(1/6)))% effectiveness, where n is the number of<br/>
bards playing cantata. Yes, this could be exceptionally powerful, what<br/>
with twisting and all, but this could easily be limited to only effect the<br/>
&quot;top&quot; bard song in the spell list of the lead singer, whilst the<br/>
&quot;recovery&quot; period of stopping the song would be such that twisting<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be possible if you were a cantata player.<br/>
Example: A group composed of 1 warrior and 2 bards stops to rest. Bard 1<br/>
begins to sing Hymn, only to be joined in song by bard 2 with Cinda&#39;s<br/>
Cantata - boosting regeneration by their now intensity music (by the SWAG<br/>
formula above that would be a +69%).<br/>
Full stacking numbers would be:<br/>
n    +%<br/>
--------<br/>
1    69<br/>
2    74<br/>
3    80<br/>
4    88<br/>
5    100<br/>
<br/>
*Anyone got any better ideas? -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
15. Song of Silence<br/>
Solon&#39;s Song of Silence<br/>
Effect: NON-PARTY: Silence.<br/>
<br/>
PBAE, fixed radius, 2 tick negate casting.  NPC has one chance to resist<br/>
intial and to break free<br/>
each tick there after. Lute for enhanced effects. Save versus Magic.<br/>
<br/>
*I love this idea personally, anyone care to add more?  I want to flesh it<br/>
out and will take action if no one objects. -Tork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
16. Serious upgrade to healing. (NB:  of all the issues brough up, this<br/>
needs the most serious analysis btw.)<br/>
<br/>
*Hopefully I?m on the right path with that I have now, but please correct<br/>
me if I?m wrong. -Tork<br/>
<br/>
Currently at 50th with a store bought lute:<br/>
Niv?s=15 hp/tick<br/>
Hymn=17 hp/tick<br/>
Total=roughly 30hp/tick<br/>
<br/>
Typical mobs encountered at that level hit in low 100?s, double hit 100%<br/>
of the time and have an approximate delay of 25.  As a damage per second<br/>
figure, that approaches 80 damage/second, 3 seconds/tick, 240 damage/tick.<br/>
 Regeneration factor: 12.5%.<br/>
Scaling to 60th,<br/>
Niv?s=22 hp/tick<br/>
Hymn=22 hp/tick<br/>
Total=roughly 44 hp/tick<br/>
<br/>
To maintain this balance, a typical L60 encounter mob can have a damage<br/>
per second output of 352, 117 damage/sec, or assuming a similar delay of<br/>
25 and double hitting 100% of the time, a per blow damage of 146.<br/>
<br/>
We know this not to be the case as plane of sky ?yard trash? easily<br/>
eclipses this figure.  Therefore, we are in need of an upgrade to healing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
17. Melanie?s Call to Arms<br/>
<br/>
*I removed the nix hate list bit as per some very valid points brought up.<br/>
-Tork<br/>
<br/>
Trying to come up with a song that is<br/>
1) extremely powerful<br/>
2) no other class has<br/>
3) makes bards extremely wanted on raids (a la enchanters)<br/>
4) and has coding already built into the game<br/>
<br/>
I came up with a song that is the opposite of Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous<br/>
Motion. A song that teleports all party members in the zone to the bards<br/>
location.<br/>
Name: Melanie&#39;s Call to Arms<br/>
This song would be extremely useful in conjunction with a binding group<br/>
leader. Imagine doing an Efreeti Raid in SolB and wanting to bring in<br/>
other members since some need to leave. Instead of breaking through again<br/>
the group leader would be bound at zoneline, group up the bard and gate<br/>
back to his bindpoint. The group leader would then group up the 4 new<br/>
members and the song would be sung and would teleport everyone back to the<br/>
bard. There are a few problems with this that may make it too powerful.<br/>
Such as Plane of Sky (never been myself) where this song could not be used<br/>
to bypass the teleporters etc  This song combined with Selo&#39;s would make<br/>
the bard extremely wanted in any group, but especially raids. The song may<br/>
need to use up mana, although I really don&#39;t want all our songs using up<br/>
mana.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
18. Group damage dispersion/distribution<br/>
Name: Song of Solidarity *New name suggestions anyone? -Tork<br/>
Function: Whenever a member of the party takes damage, that damage it<br/>
distributed among the party members.<br/>
For example, a 5 person party: The warrior gets hit for 75 (make this<br/>
simple *Smiles*) points of damage. The warrior actually gets hit for 15<br/>
points, and all other party members get hit for 15 points of non-melee<br/>
damage. Very hard to code (probably a lot of logic changes,) but something<br/>
different which would augment the Bard&#39;s ability to lessen party downtime.<br/>
(Maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
19. On mana regeneration and putting ?no mana? into perspective, by John<br/>
H. Kim ;)<br/>
Just to clarify what it means to &quot;buff without exceeding your mana regen<br/>
rate...&quot;<br/>
Say each buff costs you one bubble. Say each buff lasts 60 minutes. Say<br/>
you meditate back one bubble a minute. That means you can keep a maximum<br/>
of 60 buffs up.<br/>
<br/>
How many buffs you can cast going from FM to OOM is pretty irrelevant<br/>
since buffing is almost always done during downtime. What matters is how<br/>
many buffs your mana regeneration rate allows you to maintain.<br/>
<br/>
This is the type of analysis Verant failed to do (and is failing to do)<br/>
every time they go off on one of their &quot;but bards use no mana!&quot; tangents.<br/>
No we don&#39;t use mana, but because of the short lifespan of our songs and<br/>
the (relatively) long &quot;casting time&quot; for our songs, it&#39;s pretty much the<br/>
same thing as using mana. In fact, you can think of our songs as spells<br/>
that last 12 seconds, require 5 bubbles of mana to cast, and our mana<br/>
regen rate gives us back 5 bubbles every 3 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
20. Upgraded mez capabilities.<br/>
*I?m at a loss here, given that our existing mez song is hopelessly broken<br/>
how can I hope for an upgraded one?  At any rate, ideas and suggestions or<br/>
just some one logically and polietly stating the facts surrounding Lullaby<br/>
would be very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
21. What?d I forget? :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Okay, this format looks like crap, but comments none the less.  I will<br/>
reformat tonight and get it in a revision 0 status for release tomorrow to<br/>
the list.  Man, this is been a lot of work, but I mean that in the best<br/>
possible way!  Hopefully by Thursday morning we can have it polished up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
