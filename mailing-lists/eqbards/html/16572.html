<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300826790">Not sure if it was suggested yet but I would like:<br/>
-A song that does a large heal to your target at the expense of all your mana.<br/>
-A song that will decrease a mobs hate list.  Something where if your<br/>
caster is getting beat on it would lower them on the creatures hate list<br/>
making it easier to taunt off.  Just lower it, not wipe them off the hate<br/>
list, don&#39;t want to tread on enchanters.<br/>

&gt;Nameless crashed tonight and in the chat room<br/>
&gt;GM-Hideaki was there.  He and GZ were brainstorming on<br/>
&gt;ideas for new bard songs (they were in the same room).<br/>
&gt; I told him we could help, and that I&#39;d email him our<br/>
&gt;best ideas.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please email directly to me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gww6e@...">gww6e@...</a>) your<br/>
&gt;ideas.  Please please please don&#39;t waste this<br/>
&gt;opportunity.  The bind song is an option, its been<br/>
&gt;covered actually and was proposed to me for my ideas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for your hastly responces,<br/>
&gt;-Tork@Nameless<br/>

&gt;the horses mouth.<br/>
