<div id="ygrps-yiv-671556112">This is how I handle it:  First, in one section of my quickkey slots I have<br/>
my 2 weapon slots in hotkeys 1 & 2, and for the rest I have the slots in my<br/>
inventory.  Then I wield my mandolin and lament 3 beasts.  Rather than<br/>
bellowing (bellowing takes too long, first lament will wear off), I run up<br/>
to the fourth and wack him with my fists, turn and run.  While the creature<br/>
gives chase I can easily pick up my shield and place it on the mandolin in<br/>
my quickey slot, then put the madolin on my weapon and take it over to wield<br/>
it.  By this time I can then turn around and begin fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Realize that you should press F1 to target yourself, and go ahead and try<br/>
out a lament on yourself.  Now you can see just how long one of your own<br/>
laments will last.  Try it with just voice and a stringed instrument.  Voice<br/>
lament doesn&#39;t last long at all, but is probably best if you only need to<br/>
use on one creature.<br/>

&gt;Isn&#39;t the effect of the Lament only temporary?  For example, lets say there<br/>
&gt;are four orcs standing together.  As a 10th level bard, I know I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;handle them all at once.  I target the first three in order and sing the<br/>
&gt;Lament.  In my experience so far, by the time I finish singing the Lament<br/>

&gt;&gt;      1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area<br/>
&gt;&gt;      effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a<br/>
&gt;&gt; step<br/>
&gt;&gt;      by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group<br/>
&gt;&gt;      of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; *************************<br/>
&gt;&gt; The way the lull spell works is that it is not an Area effect.  It is a<br/>
&gt;&gt; single target spell.  What you do is you select one of the Mob in turn<br/>

&gt;&gt; all of the MOB except for the one you want to fight.  This spell will<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; back off out of range of the rest of the MOB and attack that one.  Then<br/>
&gt;&gt; repeat the step for the other 3.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I hoped this help.<br/>
