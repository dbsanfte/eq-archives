&gt; You are 33 and people 3-5 levels above you won&#39;t group with you?!<br/>
&gt; WTF? They must not know that they will get xp (and plenty of it) with you<br/>
&gt; around. OK, I don&#39;t remember exactly the floor and ceiling limit for similar<br/>
&gt; level ppl to group. I know up to like 20th it&#39;s a 4 lvl above or below<br/>
&gt; limit. But after 20th things change. When I was 20th I was able to group<br/>
&gt; with a 26th level person and get xp. When I was 23 I was grouping with 30th<br/>
&gt; level ppl and getting xp. 3-5 level differences at your level will not put<br/>
&gt; any significant dent in anyone&#39;s xp gains. They are just being either<br/>
&gt; ignorant, or greedy. My 32nd lvl friend used to party with 40th lvl ppl all<br/>
&gt; the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the game designers (Ryan Palacios) casually mentioned the algorithm for<br/>
determining whether you can group with people to me once, but foolishly, I<br/>
didn&#39;t write all of it down.  I do remember the meat of it, which is that the<br/>
distance that people can be apart is one quarter the levels of the highest level<br/>
person in the party.  So a level 40 person and a level 31 person could group and<br/>
both get experience.  There were a number of exceptions involved as well, but I<br/>
dont&#39; remember them :(  I believe there is a lower limit of 3, which makes<br/>
sense.  Unfortunately, too many people seem to think that this is the UPPER<br/>
limit as well.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to play only with the same people all the time, and we&#39;re all the same<br/>
level, so I don&#39;t have a lot of experience to go on here.  I know when I was<br/>
level 19, I could group with people who were level 25, but not with people who<br/>
were level 30.<br/>
