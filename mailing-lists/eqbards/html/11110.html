<div id="ygrps-yiv-29348988">Oh - but no - Verant said long ago that it was NOT a bug.<br/>
<br/>
course, sometimes I don&#39;t think they can really make up their minds between<br/>
what is a bug/undocumented feature/exploit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway why would you state it&#39;s SO OBVIOUS?  Why shouldn&#39;t a speed type<br/>
effect counter a non-speed type effect? Seems right logical to me. If there<br/>
is a bug - it&#39;s that the root icon doesn&#39;t disappear after being countered.<br/>

&gt;&gt; On a happier note I did some testing of Accelerando last nite vs. Root.<br/>
&gt;&gt; This was prompted because prior to the patch I had made the following<br/>
&gt;&gt; observation accidentally in Kithicor.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was running across the zone when a skeleton of some description rooted<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Accelerando was up and running and of course I stuck in place.  Since the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Mob wasn&#39;t advancing I quickly switched to twisting the two MR songs I had<br/>
&gt;&gt; memmed to hopefully resist some spells until Root wore of.  Two pulses<br/>
 </span></blockquote>later<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; when I got the &quot;you slow down&quot; message from Accelerando running out I was<br/>
&gt;&gt; free!  Even though I had the Root icon clearly on the screen I was able to<br/>
&gt;&gt; run to the zone.  Immediately on the other side of the zone I was Rooted<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; several minutes.  I tested this again before yesterday&#39;s patch and the<br/>
&gt;&gt; pattern held, Accelerando, if it was on when the Root stuck, would break<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Root when it wore off.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; After the patch this has again changed.  Last nite I tested some more to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>see<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; what other change had been made.  If you are Rooted and Accelerando is not<br/>
&gt;&gt; up, it will not break it.  If Accelerando is running when you get Rooted<br/>
&gt;&gt; however, the very first &quot;Your feet move faster&quot; pulse message will break<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; free.  This happened every time I tried it, both with Root and Ghoul Root.<br/>
&gt;&gt; The icon remained on the screen and moving to a new zone caused the Root<br/>
&gt;&gt; icon to again take hold.<br/>
&gt;&gt; For now, as long as Accelerando is running when you get Rooted, relax.  At<br/>
&gt;&gt; the next pulse you should (to use Verant&#39;s wording despite my actual real<br/>
&gt;&gt; testing) be able to move freely.  If Accelerando goes down though you will<br/>
&gt;&gt; not be able to restart it.  If you zone with that Root icon still on your<br/>
&gt;&gt; screen, expect to be Rooted on the other side.<br/>
