<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110923473">There&#39;s a discussion starting about Vox, white scales, and how to <br/>
handle them.  It&#39;s started on EQVault, and is probably moving to E&#39;ci <br/>
bard boards (which few knew existed ;)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The board is at:<br/>

<br/>
It would just be a good place for E&#39;ci bards to get to know each <br/>
other, as we rarely group ;)<br/>
