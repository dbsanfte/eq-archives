&gt;      Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;          A couple of questions from a new bard on your list. (I apologize<br/>
&gt;      if these have been asked before) BTW, this is by far the most<br/>
&gt;      interesting and mature Everquest list that I have seen so far.  Must<br/>
&gt;      say something about the type of person that enjoys playing a bard.<br/>
&gt;      (join the EQ_clerics list for a bit and you&#39;ll see what I mean...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome to the list! I too was surprised that (currently) there are no <br/>
flames going on and it seems everyone is getting along fine - no complaints <br/>
here!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area<br/>
&gt;      effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a <br/>
&gt;step<br/>
&gt;      by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group<br/>
&gt;      of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m waiting for the answer to this myself =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      3.  I am a Level 10 human Bard.  I usually party with an Enchanter<br/>
&gt;      (good combo, the pet tanks, she zaps and I tank/support) but I am<br/>
&gt;      rather poor.  Any good suggestions on location or MOBS that garner a<br/>
&gt;      goodly amount of loot so I can finish my banded ensemble?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depends on where you currently are hanging out. I was mostly in Beholder <br/>
around that level with a group. Hunting minos for their axes and a horn (for <br/>
later use). Also spent quite a bit of time in the North Ro desert. If you <br/>
are on Faydwer  I would say try for Crushbone, the Lesser Fay bandits, the <br/>
Butcherblock Orcs, or maybe the Steamfont skeletons (I think your a little <br/>
high for the skellies though?). Near Freeport, I would suggest Desert of Ro. <br/>
Lots of wandering mobs. Near Qeynos I would suggest Blackburrow. I also hear <br/>
West Karanas has some good hunting grounds, though I have never tried there. <br/>
Actually tons of other places to go.<br/>
