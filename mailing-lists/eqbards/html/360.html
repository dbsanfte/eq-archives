<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-59129732"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve noticed my Foraging skill hasnt gone up past 40 or so. Do bards<br/>
&gt;have a skill cap on this skill? I&#39;m a Human bard also. Maybe you wood<br/>
&gt;elf bards can get your foraging maxed (5xlvl+5).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a Wood Elf bard, now level 22. I forage constantly, and my skill has <br/>
never gone up. At level 12 it showed up as available for training, but when <br/>
I tried to seed it it said that it was already at maximum level.  I <br/>
reported this as a bug.<br/>
