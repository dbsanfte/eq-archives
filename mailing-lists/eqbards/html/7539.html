<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135899476">Amen!  Not only have I loved my Bard (level15) since day 1,<br/>
but my Shaman (level 30) as well.  Finding a way to compensate for the<br/>
weaknesses and augment the strengths of any given level is the fun of the<br/>
game.  For instance, at level 30, my Shaman is now a healer/buffer.  My<br/>
damage spells aren&#39;t really as effective at this point, whereas two levels<br/>
ago they were my mainstay.  I could easily complain that the Shaman class<br/>
sucks at dealing damage after level 29, but the fact is, at this level, it<br/>
is simply not my strength.  This will change again after I get my next tier<br/>
of spells.  I&#39;m sure the Bard is the same way, although she is not yet at a<br/>
high enough level for it to be really noticeable.<br/>
<br/>
		The fun of  &quot;hybrid&quot; characters is that you have to<br/>
continually evolve as you acquire new songs/spells.  I think a lot of people<br/>
find an effective way to play their character at an early level and then<br/>
refuse to change their methods as they mature, thus becoming dissatisfied<br/>
with their character as it seems &quot;weak.&quot;    <br/>
