<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762685562">I&#39;ve been using Lullaby a lot recently to take down multiple blues while<br/>
soloing.  From what I have observed, it seems to work similarly to our other<br/>
songs.  When the effect goes off the mobs get a chance to resist.  If they<br/>
fail to resist they nod.  When they would next get to attack they get a<br/>
chance to break the nod, if they do they attack.  Just as with some other<br/>
songs this results in the effect getting broken before it ever costs the MOB<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
I forget offhand what the other songs are that function this way, but I<br/>
remember John lamenting on the fact that the song could work and be broken<br/>
before it really had any effect.  I have seen it to always interrupt a<br/>
caster if they nod though in my experience, but then again I haven&#39;t been to<br/>
the Temple of Cazic Thule. ;)<br/>

I&#39;m starting to notice this more and more.  You can pretty much tell when<br/>
everyone in your group is attacking the same mob by their orientation<br/>
towards the mob.  A lot of the time, I get the &quot;head nods&quot; message for all<br/>
the mobs but the extra mobs that should be asleep keep attacking.  Very<br/>
disappointing.<br/>

&gt; TRYING to use Lullaby in Cazic-Thule last night and I&#39;d get a &quot;nods&quot;<br/>
&gt; message<br/>
&gt; for EVERY mob and then get hit by two or three.  This is really<br/>
&gt; aggravating.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s gotten so my groups are saying &quot;That song&#39;s not useful, quit using<br/>
&gt; it.&quot;<br/>
