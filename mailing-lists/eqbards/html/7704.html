<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851401045">Speaking on the &quot;this game is generally enjoyable&quot; theme...<br/>
just a comment.  I love this game, I think it&#39;s the best game ever and I<br/>
hope to play it for a long time.  Call me gullible but I don&#39;t think Verant<br/>
is trying to manipulate us.  I think their intentions are actually to create<br/>
a fun, well balanced game that people enjoy playing.<br/>
<br/>
		But last night, we had an incident which was particularly<br/>
frustrating.  I was playing my Shaman (there was a Bard in our group so I<br/>
guess it&#39;s somewhat relevant :P) and we were camping the throne room in<br/>
CT... we had held it for several hours with no problems.  So in comes high<br/>
level character - high 40s.  Doesn&#39;t say a word, is invisible, when we ask<br/>
what he is there for he says &quot;piss off&quot; and then proceeds to kill steal the<br/>
Tae in one cast.  Steals the rubi as well.. but oh well, ks is part of the<br/>
game right? I asked him why, he says &quot;I&#39;m evil - deal with it&quot;... well, at<br/>
least he role plays :-) <br/>
<br/>
		Twenty minutes later, Shadownight walks in - level 41 with<br/>
level 41 cleric friend.  I actually know and am &quot;friends&quot; with the SK. My<br/>
group rather tiredly confirms that he is there to KS from us... I ask him<br/>
why... he says to us (dressed in full rubicite) &quot;I don&#39;t have much time to<br/>
get this i... I am selling my account on ebay and will need this rubi to<br/>
twink my level 1 character on my new account.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
		Is it me, or is this just ridiculous?  I guess the point of<br/>
this rather long winded post is that it is this stuff which makes the game<br/>
less enjoyable to me, not the lack of binding ability. I guess this is just<br/>
part of the game now, and I will put off my dreams of rubi pants until level<br/>
40+ when I will lower myself to KS just because I can. :-) <br/>

				This game is very enjoyable even as a casual<br/>
player, which is what I have to<br/>
				call myself, Ive been playing since release<br/>
and Im still a bard of almost 25<br/>
				levels, now I do have many more<br/>
personalities, in their teens, and here is<br/>
				why...... At this level my bard has to<br/>
almost all the time be in a group to<br/>
				advance, without takeing 3 steps back for<br/>
every one forward........ It is<br/>
				harder to get in a group and get established<br/>
in a location if you have<br/>
				limited time...... Ever tried to get in<br/>
groups in HK, can take hour or more.<br/>
				Which is why I have many characters in the<br/>
mid teens, I can solo them.<br/>
