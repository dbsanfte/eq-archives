<div id="ygrps-yiv-855218364">Even if it is possible to repair wear completely many if not most people<br/>
will not do so.  Their items will deteriorate and will break.  This is a<br/>
fact of life.  Car engines last immensely longer if you change the oil every<br/>
3000 miles religiously and yet I know many people who don&#39;t.  Just because<br/>
wear can be prevented does not mean it will be, especially if you have to<br/>
run all the way to a city to get it done.  Some people will take excellent<br/>
care of their equipment, others will be too lazy or forgetful to do so and<br/>
will suffer for it.  Unfortunate but true.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I still like my idea of loot-once-per-lifetime.  It lets you<br/>
&gt; &gt;keep items rare while keeping the mobs common.  It also stops<br/>
&gt; &gt;harvesting dead in its tracks.  The only really bad part is<br/>
&gt; &gt;that you can&#39;t continuously camp a mob until you get the item<br/>
&gt; &gt;you want, but then, that&#39;s really the root of all these<br/>
&gt; &gt;problems isn&#39;t it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mhh if I understand this as:<br/>
&gt; You can only loot a named mob ONCE, regardless of what it have.<br/>
&gt; I can see a couple of problems with it:<br/>
&gt; - Some mobs you can tell if its the rare or the common drop it carries.<br/>
&gt; So youll have people killing it until its drop is rare and then looting<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
<br/>
Just create dummy objects which are &quot;mundane&quot; but have the<br/>
same graphic as both drops, and load one of each all the time.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; - Even on mobs where the drop isent visable this could be used, unless the<br/>
mere<br/>
&gt; examination of the body would count as a loot? Imagine being attacked<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; trying to loot your ghoulbane *ouch*..<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any occasion where we&#39;ve killed something,<br/>
been able to examine it, but died/had to leave before we could<br/>
loot it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This would make items very rare indeed, but also open up for some serius<br/>
flaws<br/>
&gt; IMO.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s without flaws.  What I&#39;m saying is that<br/>
the flaws seem to be more acceptable IMHO than the flaws that<br/>
come with the current system - extreme mob rarity, camping,<br/>
harvest, selling on ebay, etc.  It&#39;d be more in keeping with<br/>
the fiction as well - you kill Dvinn and for all intents and<br/>
purposes he&#39;s dead in your universe, no need to kill him again<br/>
(though you could choose to to help someone kill him in their<br/>
universe).  If you didn&#39;t get the dirk from him, you could<br/>
always trade for it, except now you know that any item you<br/>
trade for is not going to have been attained via harvesting.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think the only viable way to get items out of circulation is to make<br/>
them wear<br/>
&gt; out. If its possible to mend them it should be done by NPC&#39;s and be priced<br/>
upon<br/>
&gt; what &quot;level&quot; of equipment we are talking about and price comparable with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; indgrediants casters use. In a way so that the expences per played hour is<br/>
&gt; around the same.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, if you make it possible to repair wear<br/>
completely, then it&#39;s the same thing as not having wear except<br/>
when people get hit by bugs or make stupid mistakes.  And that<br/>
already happens for item destruction (items eaten in trade<br/>
bugs, accidently selling/giving items to NPCs, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Partial repair is the same thing as a slower wear rate, just<br/>
more inconvenient since you have to take time to repair stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As it is today melee classes havent got any expenses other than food and<br/>
initial<br/>
&gt; costs of equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Well, likewise for the casting classes.  Once you buy the<br/>
spells, that&#39;s it.  Yeah there are some reagent costs, but<br/>
most are trivial by the time you&#39;re high enough level to use<br/>
the spells.<br/>
