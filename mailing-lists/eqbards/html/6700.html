&gt; I kind of agree and disagree.  When I group randomly, the<br/>
&gt; items usually go via lotto.  So far people have been pretty<br/>
&gt; good about withdrawing their names from the lotto if they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t use or don&#39;t need an item (i.e. already have something<br/>
&gt; better).  But I see your point about need-based distribution<br/>
&gt; being worse than lotto in long run for bards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem is as you get higher level, you get a lot less random<br/>
grouping. It&#39;s pretty hard to just do pickup groups for a lower guk<br/>
expedition, or it was. Maybe now that lower guk is more crowded this has<br/>
changed, but when I was going there, it actually required some planning<br/>
and getting a group together in advance before venturing down to take on<br/>
the cavalier or other lower mobs.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I had a regular group and was happy to see the items go to the<br/>
people that needed them most. But, it gets a bit old after 3 or 4 weeks<br/>
of seeing items that are just perfect for everyone else in your group<br/>
show up while you sit there getting the afterthoughts.<br/>
<br/>
As to them only adding instruments. I can&#39;t really see that helping a<br/>
heck of a lot and in a way, I can&#39;t see it happening at all. The only<br/>
other instruments that would benefit from an improvement would be a<br/>
stringed or brass instrument, and, remembering JM Cappozi&#39;s telling us<br/>
they still debated inside Verant whether we were too powerful, I just<br/>
can&#39;t see them giving us an instrument that would make our damage songs<br/>
do more damage. A wind instrument, IMO, would be useless. How would it<br/>
benefit us to be more invisible, or more levitated? :)<br/>
<br/>
Recent news from the patch server is that there&#39;s now a pile of new<br/>
Ranger only weapons going into the game (ya like Rangers needed more<br/>
stuff). These are appearantly quest only weapons. Maybe they will<br/>
eventually get around to putting some things in for Bards, but I am<br/>
starting to wonder. Without an in house &quot;patron&quot; (as it is quite obvious<br/>
that dispite claims to the contrary no one at Verant plays a Bard as<br/>
their main character) or a loud protest like other classes have<br/>
organised, I just can&#39;t see it happening. It seems the noisy wheels get<br/>
the grease in this game and it seems like the kind of person who is<br/>
attracted to playing a bard has less tendancy to start loud protests. I<br/>
think we probably just quietly move on to other characters.<br/>
