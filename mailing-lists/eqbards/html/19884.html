<br/>
It was dropped by a Dragon which had never been killed before on _any_<br/>
server.<br/>

&gt; Well, not exactly &quot;found&quot; on a server.  Afaik, it was dropped in the first<br/>
&gt; kill of Trakanon - the poison dragon when Fires of Heaven took him down<br/>
&gt; early this weekend.  Not like &quot;finding&quot; a foraged item or a bag on the<br/>
&gt; ground in the woods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A patch goes on the server.  THEN a Singing Breatplate is found on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; server.<br/>
