&gt; Unless you play on a PvP server - or as a PvP player - it never ceases to<br/>
&gt; amaze me how some folks think someone with &#39;better&#39; stuff than they have<br/>
&gt; are somehow at an &#39;advantage&#39;. Unless it affects YOU - does it REALLY matter?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a multi-player game with fixed-rate resources, where<br/>
things you do either directly or indirectly DOES affect<br/>
everyone else.  By definition, anything that helps someone<br/>
else is a disadvantage for me.  If that weren&#39;t the case, we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need to balance anything, and it wouldn&#39;t matter if<br/>
anyone cheated, duped, kill stole, harvested, etc.<br/>

Can you deny that when too many people are in Unrest, your<br/>
enjoyment of the game suffers?  Do you think it suddenly<br/>
becomes that way once you exceed X number of people?  Of<br/>
course not.  As X increases from 0, the average enjoyment of<br/>
the players goes up (easier to break in), peaks, then starts<br/>
to go down.  Being too high level, twinked, having equipment<br/>
unavailable to others, etc, can cause your contribution to X<br/>
to be greater than 1; meaning if things are at the downward<br/>
slope of the enjoyment curve, your presence is hurting them<br/>
more than their presence is hurting you.<br/>

&gt; better stuff - don&#39;t you take it? I just can&#39;t understand this at all -<br/>
&gt; especially in an environment that is so group oriented that any pluses a<br/>
&gt; group member may have is going to HELP you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If something someone else has/does can help you, then it&#39;s<br/>
also possible for something someone else has/does to hurt<br/>
you.  You can attempt to place a &quot;diode&quot; upon this reciprocity<br/>
(which is what the PvP switch does), but it will never be<br/>
perfect.  Eliminating all hurtful interactions would require<br/>
the elimination of all interactions, at which point it&#39;s no<br/>
longer a multi-player game.<br/>
