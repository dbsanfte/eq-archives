<div id="ygrps-yiv-774723858">Just a side-note about Carillon.<br/>
I was in Felwithe in the armory window-shopping and tried Carillon on the <br/>
high-elf female npc shopkeepers that stand behind the counter (in the shop <br/>
next to the bank). I noticed their faction was still apprehensive to me (i <br/>
am half-elf Quellious follower - guess they don&#39;t like that much =).  I <br/>
figured it just wasn&#39;t working...<br/>
Then, I walked AROUND the counter to stand directly in front of the npc and <br/>
tried again and they became Amiable!<br/>
<br/>
This also happened with the armor merchant in East Freeport - he was <br/>
indifferent even with Carillon until i walked AROUND the his counter and <br/>
stood in front of him. Amiable.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share this.<br/>
