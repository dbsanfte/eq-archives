<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-533008892">hehe we&#39;re agreeing with each other ;)  I said that for us it&#39;s a personal<br/>
choice ;)  Either keep Y&#39;kesha&#39;s for the higher dmg or go with Waki&#39;s for<br/>
slightly less dmg but much lower taunt factor.<br/>
<br/>
hehe we&#39;re saying the same thing ;)<br/>

&gt; log analyes but have not performed any tests myself. I have seen both<br/>
&gt; weapons compared endlessly with this person or that person comparing logs<br/>
&gt; and analyzing with different formulas. I&#39;ve seen tests where the yak beat<br/>
&gt; out the wak, and I&#39;ve seen tests where Waks beat out Yak with procs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically, I think it comes down to a trade off situation for us bards. At<br/>
&gt; the lower levels of proccing (37-45) I loved my Ykeshas because most of my<br/>
&gt; time was spent in guk or Sol B. After 46 when you start hitting the planes<br/>
&gt; and go on FG/Phinigel raids regularly I think they become a liability. But<br/>
&gt; hey - it&#39;s just my opinion, and I believe a Yak &quot;vastly&quot; outdamaging a wak<br/>
&gt; in the hands of a bard can be considered exaggeration most of the time (in<br/>
&gt; longer fights).<br/>
