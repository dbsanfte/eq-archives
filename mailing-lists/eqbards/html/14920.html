&gt; &gt; Hrm - what if it were line-of-sight only, sort of a targetable levitate<br/>
&gt; &gt; that only affects corpses?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmmm, would this mean, the corpse would float over to the party?  Well<br/>
&gt;that would be worth it for effect only...  Even better if the corpse<br/>
&gt;(with &quot;Elfson&#39;s Corpse&quot; still as name) would get up and walk over to the<br/>
&gt;bard.  Call it &quot;Talies Call of the Dead&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>

would be perfect ;)<br/>
&quot;Talies&#39; Dance of the Dead - targetted corpse, if within range (limited to <br/>
about 100 feet or so, of course) gets up and walks to it&#39;s owner (Owner <br/>
must be within &quot;heal&quot; range of the Bard)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This would be great for lava and &quot;stuck in the wall&quot; retrievals, but not as <br/>
powerful as the Necro summoning. Additionally, Necros could get this as a <br/>
spell at a lower level, giving them a little more power, too.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...<br/>
