<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043639007">Question:  could you have un-charmed him with a pumice stone? (casts nullify<br/>
magic)<br/>
<br/>
I have been carrying one since doing lots of hunting in Kith.  Then Sunday<br/>
afternoon took on the Ghoul Messenger to help some ranger get his plans.<br/>
The ghoul errand boy decided to root me so I did a F1 (target self) & right<br/>
click on the pumice stone and poof no root.  <br/>
<br/>
Could it have worked to un-charm Soggy?<br/>
<br/>
Sylly.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. and where was Joolluv? She prolly coulda saved yer butts &lt;g&gt;<br/>

		  Last night me and a druid friend raided Castle Mistmoore.<br/>
		  <br/>
		  I got the Gypsy Lute and the Lute of the Gypsy Princess,<br/>
so<br/>
		  I know have three lutes in my inventory.  I decided to<br/>
test<br/>
		  them each out, again, for kicks.  Maybe Verant adjusted<br/>
them<br/>
		  during the last patch, I thought.  Or not.  heh.  The<br/>
normal<br/>
		  lute, the gypsy lute, and the LotGP all did 17 hp recovery<br/>
		  with Hymm.<br/>
<br/>
		  Maid showed up (fangless) so we handed the wreath to<br/>
another<br/>
		  friend.  And the Butler never did spawn.<br/>
<br/>
		  I also died in the attempt, when Ms. Davassi surpassed all<br/>
		  level boundries and charmed my druid friend who was oh...<br/>
		  20 freakin levels higher than her.  Damn cheating NPCs.<br/>
		  Needless to say, a level 50 druid casting starfire on you<br/>
		  will knock the stuffing out of you.<br/>
<br/>
		  You feel the gaze of the heavens. <br/>
<br/>
		  (translate:  You just lost 3 bubbles of health)<br/>
<br/>
		  In the current situation, deep in the castle, running was<br/>
		  a bad idea, so I found my little corner and waited for the<br/>
		  last starfire to hit.  One death is worth the lute to me.<br/>
		  Plus we got a variety of other trinkets, AND I got a cute<br/>
		  screenshot of me as a dead wolf.<br/>
