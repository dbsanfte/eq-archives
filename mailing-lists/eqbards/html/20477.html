Subject: [eqbards] Question for the elder bards<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are ice giants charmable?  I did my first Vox run ever last night, and<br/>
the puller failed his FD and brought 5 mobs.  1 Priest of Naggy, 1 IG<br/>
Magi, 2 regular IGs and a frozen terror, or something like that.  I tried<br/>
almost continually, and was not able to stick a single charm on *any* of<br/>
them.  My un-buffed CHA is something around 139, my level is 49, and<br/>
their MR could not have been *that* high, as casters lower level than I<br/>
were sticking spells fine.<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, and for anyone who likes reading &quot;I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t happen to me&quot;<br/>
stories...our very last IG of the five (and a regular IG, too) was down<br/>
to the &#39;c&#39; in his name, when *poof* he disappeared from the king room,<br/>
where we were fighting.  Not two seconds later, we hear &quot;Cali!&quot;, and our<br/>
warrior is gone.  She had just enough time to say &quot;he is under Vox&quot;<br/>
before she died.  I was next, only the IG had moved back towards us, a<br/>
bit.  In fact, he was stading right over a polar bear trap.  So, I got<br/>
summoned, hit once, fell through through the floor, got summoned again,<br/>
hit again, fell again...you get the picture.  I tried to /q, but it<br/>
obviously did not work in time, as I came back to Firiona Vie. <br/>
Fortunately, I caught a tele to the mainland and ran all the way back up<br/>
to Perma, arriving right about the time the GMs summoned my corpse (and<br/>
all the other people who were trapped in walls and such other weird<br/>
stuff, down in Vox&#39;s lair).  Needless to say, it will be a *loong* while<br/>
before I try Vox again...<br/>
