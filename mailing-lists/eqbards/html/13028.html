<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930038496">That will work fine and dandy assuming you trust the people enough in your<br/>
group to pull your corpse to the zone to get a res.  If you are in a pickup<br/>
group and don&#39;t know the people you are grouping with, you are taking a big<br/>
risk if you /consent them.  Thats one of the disadvantages of a pickup group<br/>
I discussed below.<br/>

&gt; I agree.  I usually find myself joining pickup groups.  What I have found<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>
&gt; considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the<br/>
&gt; problem<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull<br/>
&gt; turns<br/>
&gt; bad<br/>
&gt; and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far<br/>
&gt; away,<br/>
&gt; the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the<br/>
&gt; casters<br/>
&gt; leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; zone they died in.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this into<br/>
&gt; consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs personal<br/>
&gt; welfare.  <br/>
