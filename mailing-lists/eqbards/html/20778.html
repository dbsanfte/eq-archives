If you have more than one bard in the group (which I have had a bunch) can both bards uses Chords of Discord and damage the same mobs? Or are these songs limited like regular spells appear to be? [I&#39;m pretty sure Hymn of Restoration does not heal faster, but that too is a question; any chance for a chorus to be more effective than a soloist?] <br/>

Most Bard songs do not stack on top of each other - once you have a song being sung to you, having more than one person singing the song does not give any further effect. With the way EQ Bardic magic was built, Bards are more soloists then chorus members. Any song with a duration (that leaves an icon) will not stack - so no, having two Bards using the Hymn of Restoration will not make you heal faster. Having two bards using Chords could be more effective then a single Bard singing it - monsters do occasionally save verses the song. It would probably be better for the multiple Bard party, however, to sing different songs. <br/>
<br/>
This being said, the following is a list of Bard songs that do not have a duration (they leave no icon), and can therefore be played by any number of Bards at full effect. <br/>

  a.. Alenia`s Disenchanting Melody <br/>
  b.. Brusco`s Boastful Bellow <br/>
  c.. Brusco`s Bombastic Bellow <br/>
  d.. Cassindra`s Chorus of Clarity <br/>
  e.. Denon`s Desperate Dirge <br/>
  f.. Denon`s Dissension <br/>
  g.. Lyssa`s Cataloging Libretto <br/>
  h.. Lyssa`s Locating Lyric <br/>
  i.. Melanie`s Mellifluous Motion <br/>
  j.. Song of Dawn <br/>
  k.. Song of Highsun <br/>
  l.. Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria <br/>
