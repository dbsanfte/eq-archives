<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317586205">From Friday night:<br/>
I finally went to bed on Saturday morning at 2:00am a happy level 19.  As my<br/>
guild was doing a Najena raid I really wanted to get back to the &quot;mainland&quot;<br/>
from Kunark on Saturday...  Saturday night I still found myself in Kunark<br/>
trying to help a friend get his char. to level 19 for the raid.  We found a<br/>
great group near the goblin ruins at the Lake and just flew.  We cycled<br/>
through a heap of group members but almost always kept a full group.  It was<br/>
insane!  We were basically fighting non-stop pulling blues to yellows.  We<br/>
tried one or two pulls out of the Ruins and died massive deaths ;)  So at<br/>
2am(+10 GMT) Sunday morning I made level 20!  One level in one day! I was<br/>
just wrapped!  At 2:02am  my first skill hit master and I was already off<br/>
and pulling again for the group (after we stopped for some SS&#39;s of my level<br/>
20 group).  I had a guild member and friend that wanted to come along for my<br/>
naming &quot;ceremony&quot;.  So at 2:35am Jacana got her surname and more SS&#39;s were<br/>
taken :)  A few more pulls were done and then I went to bad a very happy<br/>
camper.<br/>
<br/>
Sundays guild Najena raid was a bomb for us (and for the rest of the guild).<br/>
A group of us decided we were going to head back to Kunark.  As we went<br/>
through the forest we smacked around some DE&#39;s :)  Then in ECommons I got<br/>
side tracked (MMMMM! Male Half-Elf Bards) and they headed on with out me.<br/>
Of the group of 5 two logged but 3 would still be enough in Kunark.  So I<br/>
finally caught up with them in FV and it was only then I realised I didn&#39;t<br/>
get my songs I wanted.  So I ran back to the boat in time to see it pull off<br/>
(bloody trams!).  That was enough!  Another member logged so two were left.<br/>
I shouted for a TP back to BB and we found one.<br/>
<br/>
Off to get songs I went.  And suddenly got in my head that tonight was<br/>
Lambent Bracers night!  After a few hours of shouting I got my &#39;feene charm<br/>
and a lambent stone (from a friend) and the darkbone was already in my bank<br/>
from some nice people in Unrest days...<br/>
<br/>
So after I hit Eurdin for my songs it was off for the Lambents.  I realised<br/>
when I got to the temple it said 550gp.  I had everything in PP *DOH*  So<br/>
back to the bank I went and back again.  Finally at about 10:45 last night I<br/>
ended up with my first piece of lambents!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I was given two amazing weapons by a very very sweet high level bard<br/>
this weekend (as well as a few pieces of armour).  My thulian claw and<br/>
silvery war axe have been replaced with a Sainy&#39;s Claw and a Gleaming Broad<br/>
Sword (or is it short sword?)<br/>
<br/>
Now that&#39;s what I call bards luck ;)<br/>
