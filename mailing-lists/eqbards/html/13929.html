<div id="ygrps-yiv-949841453"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; You use warriors to pull???  I&#39;ve never seen a warrior pull up to 22nd<br/>
&gt; level.  We always use a ranger or a monk with FD, or a bard.  I do agree<br/>
&gt; that a level 50 with the right equipment would beat the pet<br/>
&gt; though.  Still a<br/>
&gt; FBSS isn&#39;t all that common is it?<br/>
&gt; If the pet is even as good as a 46 warrior you&#39;d still be better<br/>
&gt; off getting<br/>
&gt; the 50 necro with the pet as an extra.<br/>

the warrior pull :-).  Of course, at that time the spawn is broken and it&#39;s<br/>
just not the same thing and darn sure that warrior pulling isn&#39;t going to<br/>
help break the spawn up.<br/>
