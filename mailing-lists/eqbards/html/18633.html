<div id="ygrps-yiv-355257586">Yes this will work.  You can even dot him yourself to add to the fun before<br/>
you charm it.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER!!!!<br/>
<br/>
You MUST do direct dmg of some kind to it when the charm breaks AND before<br/>
it dies or the critter will just poof and give you no xp when it dies.<br/>
<br/>
IE:  DOT DOT DOT Charm DOT DOT CHARM CHARM let charm off.  Hit with DD or<br/>
weapons.  Critter dies<br/>
<br/>
You MUST do dmg when the last charm breaks or the dmg counters are all wiped<br/>
and you get no xp for it.<br/>
<br/>
Just some helpful info.<br/>

&gt; I have a question on our Charm.  Still a few levels away from me...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is it possible to group with a necro and have them blast a creature with<br/>
&gt; DOT&#39;s, and then have the bard charm it?  This way the DOT&#39;s would just<br/>
&gt; eat away his health, and he would just sit there while he was charmed...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If that would work I think we could develop a way to hit them with our<br/>
&gt; DOT then charm, repeat...<br/>
&gt; --<br/>
&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
