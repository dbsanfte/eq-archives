<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061801086">What a night.  I started out missing a few items from my inventory.  Upon<br/>
starting all of my food and drink and my shield were gone.  PooF!!!!  After<br/>
petitioning,,,,,,,, you all know the rest....no response except we will get<br/>
back to you in a few days.  Oh well off from Qeynos to Lake Rathetear to<br/>
meet up with some guildmates.  Oops what is that?  Why are there two icons<br/>
on my screen?  Hey who cast SOW on me.  Damn.  Well, as you all know cant<br/>
get rid of that.  So off I go running like I am carrying three times my<br/>
weight (or so it seems with SOW instead of Selo&#39;s).  Well I finally get<br/>
there.  Turn left when you enter they say.  Swim left they repeat.  An orc<br/>
hits you..and..and orchits you..and an orc..and a bandit and a bandit and a<br/>
bandit hits you.....LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.......<br/>
<br/>
Back in Qeynos.  Well, at least SOW is gone, but oh no drum.  Ok mem all the<br/>
songs again and run all the way there again.  Get there.  It is night. Wow<br/>
there sure are alot of skeletons out here.  A skeleton hits you........<br/>
Zone, whew.<br/>
<br/>
I wait until daybreak.  I find out to go right, not left and take the boat!<br/>
They didnt mention that one before. hehe.  So off to find my body deep in<br/>
the lake.  Luckily I had just made the trip to buy Tarew&#39;s and could breath<br/>
underwater, because man is that lake deep.<br/>
<br/>
I get all the way to my guildmates and oh sorry we are gonna log for the<br/>
night, but I will bind you.  Hehe thanks<br/>
<br/>
So as I sit there and try to maybe kill something a wonderful man named<br/>
Fizzer shows up.  And you see he is over level 20 and he says he was there<br/>
first because he ws sitting closer to the spawns.  So he proceeds to steal<br/>
all of the kills from all of us who were taking turns and just says &quot;oh I<br/>
dont have time to sit on eq for 20 hrs to lvl like you losers&quot;  HMMMM my day<br/>
is getting better.<br/>
<br/>
And why oh why is my EQ day so bad?  I am being punished.  Today I<br/>
downloaded and played my beta of Asheron&#39;s call. Doh!  Rodcet Nife slapped<br/>
me on the hand for that one.  Oh well.  That&#39;s ok.  The game sucks anyways,<br/>
(and no bards!) Hehe</div>
