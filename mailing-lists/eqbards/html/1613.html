&gt; i was wondering if any of our 30+ bards on this list has gotten to use<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; item.  it comes from a 30+ named gypsy musician in mistmoore.  I asked a<br/>
&gt; person that killed the musician if it was a lore item or magical or<br/>
&gt; anything, but as far as he could tell, it was neither.  it has the same wt<br/>
&gt; 0.5 as a regular drum, so I am curious to know if it improves songs any<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; used with songs.  Since it was off a named mob, the guy did not want to<br/>
sell<br/>
&gt; it to me just yet, because no one knew the worth.  anyone know about this?<br/>
