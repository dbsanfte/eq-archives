&gt;<br/>
&gt; I dunno...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe the rest of youare just more MUCH more patient than me.  I know<br/>
&gt; your much better testers....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as bards being ignored...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; one song per lvl, 50 lvls...  if the songs there aren&#39;t 50 songs - then<br/>
&gt; we aren&#39;t complete.  And they have had 8 months to get them in.  The<br/>
&gt; priority should be to complete a class before offering more spells and<br/>
&gt; weapons to others classes - and yes that means even the FA to paladins.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everyone has their own priorities.  Why should your priorities be any more<br/>
important than someone else&#39;s priorities?<br/>
<br/>
Paladins are supposed to be able to wield the mightiest holy swords in the<br/>
game, including the Fiery Avenger.  Brad loved to show off the FA in the<br/>
Beta, telling everyone how it was the &quot;most powerful sword in the game&quot; and<br/>
it was Paladin only.  Imagine if you were a Paladin.  You chose to be a<br/>
Paladin because you wanted to quest for the FA.  Wouldn&#39;t you feel your<br/>
class was incomplete if the FA didn&#39;t exist?<br/>
<br/>
Mages can summon a weapon every level.  But Verant hasn&#39;t put the level 49<br/>
summon in the game yet.  Only recently was the lvl 44 Summon Weapon spell<br/>
put into the game.  Still no word on the 49th spell.  Mages are also<br/>
incomplete, according to your own definition.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The  little things, like the enhancements that were implemented in the<br/>
&gt; last patch, didn&#39;t get mentioned the patch message?  What was up<br/>
&gt; with the whole - it&#39;s in this patch, the next patch, coming soon,<br/>
&gt; responses?  Then the patch<br/>
&gt; with the enhancements atcually happens,  but they don&#39;t bother to mention<br/>
&gt; anything - other than a change to solidarity of vision!  What about the<br/>
&gt; three weeks with no explanation given to bards? When other classes were<br/>
&gt; addressed specifically.  Again, it&#39;s a little thing, but it&#39;s about<br/>
&gt; getting the same attention paid to us as the other classes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mages had pet healing spells added. or so the patch said.  Some duplicate<br/>
Enchanter spell appeared on the vendor instead.  &quot;Database entry error&quot; we<br/>
were told.  Three patches and four weeks later, the spell is finally there.<br/>
<br/>
Shaman had Alchemy bugged for 8 months before Verant could be convinced it<br/>
was broken.<br/>
<br/>
Bards get about the same attention as every other class.  There is no<br/>
hatred of Bards at Verant, just as there is no special Bard Hate coded in<br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
Your problem is that you are only looking at it from your tiny little Bard<br/>
portal.  There are hundreds of things broken or missing in EQ.  Verant<br/>
tries to fix them, but they do a very poor job.  You seem to not care about<br/>
anything but fixing your Bard.  Verant has to fix problems with every<br/>
class.  They can&#39;t stop everything just to fix Bards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as the enhancements that went in on the last patch.  The see invis<br/>
&gt; to clouding makes the song much more useful, and increased range on<br/>
&gt; selo&#39;s is great. But did they do anything earth-shattering... no.  Did<br/>
&gt; they fix lullaby, increase dodge, implement parry, implement any mid-lvl<br/>
&gt; instruments - no.  They increased the range of 4 songs.  Now maybe some<br/>
&gt; of  you can clue me in, but I have never actually used levitation for a<br/>
&gt; group, or actually used tarews as the way to keep the group breathing<br/>
&gt; under water.  So unless I am missing something * a very likely<br/>
&gt; possibility :) *- those two &quot;enhancements&quot; aren&#39;t much of anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most bards complained that levitate and water breathing were useless in a<br/>
group partly because of the range problem.  Many Bards asked that the range<br/>
be increased.  I believe there was a bard petition to increase the range.<br/>
So they increased the range, and your not happy?<br/>
<br/>
I think this guy said it best...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Abashi is absolutely right... They do get less rants when they nerf!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that Verant has very little resource maintaining EQ.  Most<br/>
everyone is working on the expansion or new projects.  Only so much is<br/>
going to get done on each patch.  This sucks for us, and we can either<br/>
complain loudly or find another game to play.  But to insist that Verant<br/>
stops everything until you get your three missing songs (which Verant<br/>
promised would be in the expansion) is just selfish.<br/>
