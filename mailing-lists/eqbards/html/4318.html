<div id="ygrps-yiv-161978225">I had a thought about this.  These songs are AE, but I would think that the<br/>
coding on our AE affect does not include the spot we are standing on.  If you<br/>
were standing DIRECTLY under the SG so that he (or she but man those would be<br/>
ugly women) occupied the same space as you and the song wouldn&#39;t work there then<br/>
baddaboom, no affecting the SG.<br/>

&gt; Tell us!!!! or we won&#39;t tell you about screech failing!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; j/k i get the same thing on sand giants sometimes, couldn&#39;t figure it out<br/>
&gt; either.  only thing i figured was maybe i was too close to them, cause it<br/>
&gt; seemed to not work when i was right under them instead of a few steps away.<br/>
&gt; i also notice with SGs that if i am too close, like right under them, i stop<br/>
&gt; swinging.  since fear is AE though, don&#39;t know why it would have any effect.<br/>
&gt; glad i could help lol.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Last night, while I was fighting the cash-cow mob I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; mentioned before, I started to lose badly so I hit Screech<br/>
&gt; &gt; (area effect fear) and waited, and waited, and waited, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; died.  I did see the yellow glow form around the mob, but no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;flees in terror&quot; message, no resist message.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it possible that some mobs are immune to fear?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And no, I&#39;m still not telling what mob it is.  :-)  Their<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawn can&#39;t handle more than about 3 groups, and I don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant to nerf the loot on them.<br/>
