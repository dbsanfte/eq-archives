<div id="ygrps-yiv-167695724">Actually Slyde, I spoke to Lawrence Poe at the Fan Faire and his reason for<br/>
not having any of the new bard songs or &#39;disciplines&#39; in the SPDAT and<br/>
related files was something along the lines of,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bard songs are harder to code and generally take alot more internal<br/>
balancing before they are released to test. I wish I had something to put in<br/>
the SPDAT so you gyuys could look at it, but right now I don&#39;t. Sorry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that&#39;s VERY close to what he said in regards t new bard<br/>
songs/disciplines. He&#39;s a super nice guy. Bit soft spoken though.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I spoke with him about the problems with Selos and Drums of<br/>
the Beast. Oddly enough, he was unaware of the wrap-around problem with our<br/>
speed and wrote it down.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, great guy. He took alot of notes too.</div>
