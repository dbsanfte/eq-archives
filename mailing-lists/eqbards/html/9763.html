&gt; What is a tick vs a pulse vs a round vs etc etc<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Example: in Rokken&#39;s re-write of the song analysis, on Chords it says:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;It has a duration of 3 ticks (a tick is 6 seconds) after you stop playing<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Basically, the heartbeat used by the server to send info to<br/>
the client.  If you start Accel, start your stopwatch the<br/>
moment the boot icon appears and immediately stop Accel, and<br/>
stop the stopwatch when the icon disappears, you&#39;ll get times<br/>
between 12 and 18 seconds.  I think what&#39;s going on is that<br/>
your song can start at any time, but when you stop it, the<br/>
server keeps the effect going for two more heartbeats (hence<br/>
&quot;3 ticks&quot; - the first when you start the song, then two more<br/>
after you&#39;ve stopped it).  These heartbeats are independent of<br/>
your song start/stop times.<br/>
<br/>
So worst case you start and stop your song (1st tick), the 2nd<br/>
tick comes an instant after, 6 seconds later the 3rd tick<br/>
comes, and 6 seconds later on the 4th tick there&#39;s a command<br/>
from the server to stop the effect.  Total of just over 12<br/>
seconds.  Best case you start and stop your song (1st tick),<br/>
5.9 seconds later the 2nd tick comes, 6 seconds later the 3rd<br/>
tick comes, and 6 seconds later on the 4th tick there&#39;s a<br/>
command from the server to stop the song effect.  Total of<br/>
just under 18 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I also suspect a lot of things don&#39;t happen at 6 second<br/>
intervals but just seem that way because that&#39;s when the info<br/>
is sent to the client.  JM mentioned our DoTs really pulse at<br/>
2.5 second intervals and last for 4 pulses (10 sec total).  <br/>
I&#39;m beginning to suspect he was right because sometimes DDD<br/>
will seems to pulse 3 times, sometimes it seems to pulse<br/>
twice.  It&#39;s tough to know for sure though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, I would like to know which songs &quot;stack&quot; with each other.  Beyond<br/>
&gt; chant and anthem dont stack. Chant and purifying/elemental dont stack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m including stacking info (along with taunt effect,<br/>
instrument enhancement, and strategies) in my guide.  Rokken<br/>
and I are collaborating as well, so hopefully we&#39;ll get one<br/>
nice meta-guide out some time soon.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; analysis matrix - what spells are not compatible with various songs and vice<br/>
&gt; versa.  Ie: chains will break, root, snare and cancel darkness and the DoT;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been changing so much lately that I&#39;ve given up<br/>
trying to describe it for the time being.  I hear Accel speed<br/>
was nerfed lately too (haven&#39;t had a chance to play in almost<br/>
a week).  I haven&#39;t been playing much lately due to crippling<br/>
10%-30% PL and 290 ms ping times, so I should have plenty of<br/>
time to work on this.<br/>
