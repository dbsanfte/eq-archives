&gt; I haven&#39;t had a chance to test this for myself but here is my take on some<br/>
&gt; of the changes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1)  If Chain cast on yourself breaks Root and Snare like Lost Child reports,<br/>
&gt; then the nerf of Selos not breaking root should only affect bards less than<br/>
&gt; 23d level.  Still a major negative impact for newbies though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2)  If SOW overrides Selos, this can be a good thing if you are in a group<br/>
&gt; with someone who can cast SOW.  You no longer have to worry about<br/>
&gt; potentially screwing your party members over if you have to flee.  Having<br/>
&gt; SOW cast on you without your permission is still a major concern though and<br/>
&gt; I agree with Faras that we should be able to cancel the SOW similar to<br/>
&gt; Levitate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t play all day, so it&#39;d be nice if someone could test this:  If chains<br/>
breaks root and<br/>
snare, does it also break SOW?  If so, it&#39;ll just be a mild annoyance to be<br/>
SOWed, and not<br/>
a huge, annoying problem...<br/>
