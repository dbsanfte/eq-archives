<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219531604">LOL, this is indeed how the whole issue will end up.  But I really believe that<br/>
the Bards should have bind mindset is outdated, and based solely on Beta/Early<br/>
Final Bard classification as Hybrids.  If clerics were called Hybrids from the<br/>
beginning, there would be the same resistance to adding it, claiming balance<br/>
issues.  Since they were called casters, no issue.<br/>

You&#39;ve convinced me.  From this day on, Bards shall be classified as<br/>
casters.  And Bards shall be the only caster without Bind.</div>
