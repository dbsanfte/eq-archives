<div id="ygrps-yiv-10392167">Actually, it was bandied about for quite some time on other lists that this<br/>
was in fact Norrathian Urban Legend in the past, but that when Verant<br/>
decided to cut the experience loss for dying but still had hard core factins<br/>
that wanted total experience to gain a level raised to compensate, it was<br/>
decided to add that extra experience totally to the last bubble to make it<br/>
harder to detect.  The logic was if people already think this is true, who<br/>
will notice that now when they test it they can prove it really is true.<br/>
Not sure how likely this is but I did start to do some testing to find out,<br/>
maybe I will get back to that and see just what that last bubble holds in<br/>
secrets after all.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know if you all have seen this, but it was sent to me by a<br/>
&gt; friend and since I have nothing to contribute...being but a level 6<br/>
&gt; bard but having a level 27 druid and knowing it to be true.  I thought<br/>
&gt; I would share it with you all.  I hope you appreciate it as i have.<br/>
