    I whole heartedly agree.  I would much rather see this kind of exchange<br/>
than accidentally find the answers to quests that I haven&#39;t discovered yet.<br/>
I might suggest that this is why there are SUBJECT HEADINGS with each<br/>
message, so that we may all avoid the topics we have no interest in.  Just<br/>
my 2 CP on the topic { which, for those of you keeping score at home, is<br/>
worth 1/5,000 of the monthly dues  }.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;Try to use the message board for bards, not promoting your guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This didn&#39;t seem like commercialization to me either. This is a<br/>
&gt;&quot;Bard-related&quot; forum, and the Guild is certainly &quot;Bard-related&quot;... so<br/>
&gt;advertising/defending/slamming/discussing the Guild in this forum seems<br/>
&gt;more like a constructive expansion of the Bard way o&#39;life and is thus A<br/>
&gt;Good Thing. Is it any worse than, say, publishing Bard-specific<br/>
&gt;spoilers? I for one would interpret that activity as being far more<br/>
&gt;unethical than advertising a Guild - and as I will myself contribute to<br/>
&gt;some of these spoiler threads... well, you can see just HOW unethical I<br/>
&gt;really think it is :)<br/>

&gt;PS - And before someone gets the impression that my comments are<br/>
&gt;motivated by something other than sheer exuberance, I personally have<br/>
&gt;absolutely no interest in this Guild, but just knowing that it is out<br/>
&gt;there fills me with a warm and fuzzy feeling that just makes me want to<br/>
