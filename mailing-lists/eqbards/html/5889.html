&gt; The rooted or ensnared part I dont mind, but not being able to chain<br/>
&gt; SoW&#39;d or SoC&#39;d mobs is very aggravating. When they flee, they cannot be<br/>

problems and ill-feelings that develop when you make monsters<br/>
work by different rules than players.  Instead of reducing<br/>
these differences, Verant seems to be increasing them.<br/>

Unless of course this means that players with SoW or<br/>
Accelerando cannot be rooted by mobs?  That still seems<br/>
terribly unfair to the classes who cannot SoW or Accelerando<br/>
themselves.<br/>
