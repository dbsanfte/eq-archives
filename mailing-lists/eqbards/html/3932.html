<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827775537">I&#39;ve checked out that cave as well...There is a strange symbol on the wall<br/>
that repeats itself in many rooms...I found an alter, with 2 ice bone<br/>
skelly&#39;s, and believe it or not.....a house inside the cave.  (I had<br/>
flashbacks to UO).  Inside the house there were a few more skelly&#39;s...all in<br/>
all, not all that much of interest, except for the fact that a lot of people<br/>
don&#39;t know about it...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been down every passageway, but definatly most of<br/>
them...The only thing I can say is that I assumed that Sulan McBoor was a<br/>
wizard, but I could have been wrong.  (I also stayed away from him, and the<br/>
room he&#39;s in, so it stands to reason that there might be other passages on<br/>
the other side of him.  I plan on going back after every few levels till he<br/>
con&#39;s something other than red to me, so that I can see what&#39;s in the room<br/>
he&#39;s in.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I went into that cave region under the Everfrost river that<br/>
&gt;someone else mentioned.  One goblin diver at the entrance.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s dark inside so the ultravision song is handy.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;rather maze-like but very large so it isn&#39;t too bad.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;map the place, just wanted to see what was inside.  Mostly<br/>
&gt;green ice-boned skeletons.  There was one red human, looked<br/>
&gt;like a necromancer.  Sulan Mcboor or something like that.<br/>
&gt;Ready to attack, so I stayed away.  There were several more<br/>
&gt;passages that I didn&#39;t explore.  I&#39;ll try to map it some time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If ice-bones give you good experience with little chance of<br/>
&gt;death, then it might be a good uncrowded area to play in.  If<br/>
&gt;you have to run though, or the bard dies, the rest of the<br/>
&gt;group is going to be in trouble since I&#39;m not sure you can<br/>
&gt;make the trip from the ice hole to the cave without the water<br/>
&gt;breathing song.<br/>
