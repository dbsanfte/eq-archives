<b>Subject:</b> Odd Behavior from the Maestro of Rancor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-641178569">I took my first trip to hate Sunday night/Monday morning.  The Maestro visibly had<br/>
the Evensong; we pulled him; we had him down to 1/3 health with ~2/3 of our people<br/>
still alive and I really thought we would win.  Oh and I was the only bard in the<br/>
zone.  And then he poofed!  He teleported back to his organ and immediately had full<br/>
health again.  And it got too late and people started leaving so we didn&#39;t pull him<br/>
again.  *sighs*  Anyone else seen this?  Know how to prevent it?  If he cast<br/>
something then perhaps stun/mesmerize/Pixie would help?  Or was it a zone bug?<br/>
<br/>
P. S.  Bind sight is so wonderful here.  I looked through one mob&#39;s eyes at the room<br/>
and Maestro, through the Maestro&#39;s eyes at his pipe organ, and through the feigned<br/>
monk&#39;s eyes at the Maestro full face =).<br/>
