<b>Subject:</b> Re: Soloing Spectres at level 39 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-812661848"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I asked the list a while back when I was level 35<br/>
&gt; about any particular <br/>
&gt; strategies to solo spectres and as given advice to<br/>
&gt; wait until level 40 <br/>
&gt; before giving it a try. I&#39;m level 39 now, and was<br/>
&gt; cruising through Oasis <br/>
&gt; and on a whim, ran out to spectre island.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, specs are great and I believe will take you up to<br/>
49th if you don&#39;t mind slower and slower progress. <br/>
HGs are even better (money/xp) but on my server rathe<br/>
mtns have swelled to 56 which is too much.  Zone can<br/>
handle 26 with 2 bards or 34 with 1 or 2 bards.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tambourine in hand, and weaving Aria of Eagles and<br/>
&gt; Accelerando, I targeted <br/>
&gt; one of the spectres sitting on the corner. I kept a<br/>
&gt; good distance and hit <br/>
&gt; it with Chant of Flame.  I backed off to the shore<br/>
&gt; and waited over in the <br/>
&gt; plains by the &quot;shelf&quot; near Sro zone. I watched as my<br/>
&gt; target came out of the <br/>
&gt; water I started to kite him with the 2 chants. I<br/>
&gt; then noticed 2 of his <br/>
&gt; buddies coming over a ridge. Fortunately, they<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t above level 37, so I <br/>
&gt; charmed the one I was fighting, and sent him against<br/>
&gt; his buddies.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, think charm kite.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I happily observed that both of the newcomers<br/>
&gt; started beating on my pet, so <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t have to worry about being chased. I kept on<br/>
&gt; eye out for the <br/>
&gt; healthy one and charmed him when I noticed my pet<br/>
&gt; was getting beat up <br/>
&gt; pretty well. No problem, 2 died pretty quickly, and<br/>
&gt; I was left with just <br/>
&gt; kiting the last one who was at full health thanks to<br/>
&gt; his lifetaps.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t actually ever noticed an increase from the<br/>
life taps though that would follow logically.  God<br/>
knows I get hurt from it.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kiting is pretty easy as they are slower than<br/>
&gt; molasses. I observed that if <br/>
&gt; I keep away from them, I hardly got lifetapped. When<br/>
&gt; he was below a bubble <br/>
&gt; of health he started to run. Unfortunately, he<br/>
&gt; started running just as he <br/>
&gt; was out of my view. I looked around for him, but he<br/>
&gt; had disappeared and <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t even show up on track. Evidently, he warped<br/>
&gt; back to the island. As <br/>
&gt; soon as I went near the island all the spectres<br/>
&gt; aggro&#39;d on me. I zoned as I <br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t ready to tackle 5.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, unfortunatly that does happen at it TOTALLY<br/>
sucks. I found out the hard way that they occationally<br/>
jump back to their spawn point.  Also, they don&#39;t<br/>
always warp to their spawn point, but sometimes go<br/>
into the water.  Best thing to do it run straight to<br/>
the edge of the water and look for scythe.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t see it, get ready to deal with 5 :P  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, tackling 5 isn&#39;t exactly as tough as it sounds. <br/>
The only difference is you need to weave selos and<br/>
hymm inbetween charms.  I would get life typed 3 times<br/>
as I turn too close only to have it regened in 30 to<br/>
40 seconds in between charms.  Also, kite with a<br/>
mandolin in hand rather than a drum.  This is the<br/>
biggest reason why you&#39;ll get tapped more but I think<br/>
it&#39;s the only thing that keeps me alive.  Tried it<br/>
going straight drum and pulled out the mandolin when I<br/>
got down to a bubble.<br/>
 <br/>
The 2 biggest problems with kiting specs is 1 they<br/>
don&#39;t always refollow commands after charm.  Most of<br/>
the time they do but sometimes they don&#39;t.  I can<br/>
always get xp from 4 of the 5 but seldom all 5.  The<br/>
2nd is, once you clear all 5, people will move in and<br/>
start contesting the spawns.  I&#39;ve had this happen a<br/>
lot even to go so far as have people start repeatedly<br/>
KSing me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I went back and hunted them again. I chained them<br/>
&gt; when they ran. If I was <br/>
&gt; kiting just 1, I chained him instead of using<br/>
&gt; accelerando. Also, I noticed <br/>
&gt; that the closer I was to the spectre, the less<br/>
&gt; likely he was to resist my <br/>
&gt; chants. I tested this about two dozen times, but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure John Kim would <br/>
&gt; disapprove of my sample size. I&#39;ll be hunting them<br/>
&gt; more, so I&#39;ll keep an <br/>
&gt; eye on that correlation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:P The chants I have do seem to get resisted a lot. <br/>
Never bothered to test it but that would make sense. <br/>
On a side note, one thing intresting I noticed today<br/>
is my cleric seemed to med faster as the group got<br/>
larger though I could be wrong.  I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>
past Verant to mess with med times in order to force<br/>
people to group.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; SOW would have been helpful, but it&#39;s not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SOOOOO agree here.  I&#39;ve screwed up the weave many<br/>
times and got negatively reinforced to the tune of 260<br/>
points of damage.  Hehe, Electric Shock Therapy has<br/>
nothing on that!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lastly, I posted that I thought I saw less of a<br/>
&gt; wobble to our accelerando. <br/>
&gt; Well with a nice view of myself (instead of in a<br/>
&gt; dark swamp) I <br/>
&gt; unfortunately see that I still spasm my way across<br/>
&gt; the zone.<br/>

<br/>
On a side note, I don&#39;t know what I will end up doing<br/>
with my bard.  If I wanna keep my friends, I have to<br/>
play the bard.  And soloing which I have to do to<br/>
catch them is proving quite profitable (I&#39;ve made<br/>
roughly 4400 plat off of HGs and specs in 5 days) so<br/>
playing her for a bit longer sounds good to me.  Great<br/>
money and xp but it&#39;s boring and SOOO annoying.  I<br/>
just hate having to fight with people for spawns =(  I<br/>
do get some enjoyment though out of telling people off<br/>
when they call me the &quot;greedy bard&quot;.  I clear lots and<br/>
lots of greens (average is 9 to 11 per 2 HGs) and am<br/>
usually the one spawning HGs for other people, yet I&#39;m<br/>
the greedy one. /rude  Hehe, last time I cam close to<br/>
dieing was because I had a train of 2 basalisks, 4<br/>
lizardmen and 2 HGs and one of the lizards bashed me<br/>
at the wrong time.<br/>
