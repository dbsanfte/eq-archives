I&#39;m a 20th level bard and plan on going to Cazi tonight. All of my friends <br/>
and guildmates are typically bound in Freeport to go to Cazi but we will be <br/>
going in from Lake Rathe. After thinking about the logistics of bringing a <br/>
whole group that far, getting bound in Freeport then going to Cazi, I think <br/>
we will not. We are currently bound in Arena, which is a basically empty <br/>
zone right off Lake Rathe. This means we will have to cross the Rathe <br/>
Mountains and come to Cazi from the spectre side but having made the run <br/>
from Cazi to Lake Rathe once, I think it may be the closest bind point and <br/>
shortest run back. The casters of course will bind to whatever suits them, <br/>
hehe.<br/>
Brilinnia, waiting on second name :)<br/>
