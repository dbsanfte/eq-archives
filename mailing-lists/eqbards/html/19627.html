<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853184535">I did exactly that actually by parsing log files 4 nites in a row about a<br/>
month ago.<br/>
It was initially to disprove the new patch=more missed notes theory which it<br/>
did.<br/>
Interestingly, the new level=more missed notes theory seemed to be proven<br/>
true by another subsequent test.<br/>
<br/>
In that test, over the course of 3000 some odd start ups there were 137<br/>
missed notes.  Of those 137, only 35 were single missed notes.  There were<br/>
further 34 pairs, 7 triples, 2 quadruples, and 1 quintuple for a total of 79<br/>
different occurrences of missed notes.<br/>
<br/>
These results are so terrible statistically speaking I sent them to GZ to<br/>
look into as one of the best examples of the RNG being very skewed.<br/>
With a &lt;5% failure rate, only 5% should be multiple occurrences +/- at most<br/>
5%, for exactly the reason that one random number should not affect another.<br/>
That was clearly not the case.  Over the sample single missed notes occurred<br/>
only 44.0% of the time.  Pairs of missed notes occurred 43.0% of the time,<br/>
triples 8.7%, quadruples 2.5%, and quintuples 1.3%.  This is radically<br/>
different from what should be expected given normal distribution of a simple<br/>
random.  The sample size was enormous, more than enough for good statistical<br/>
accuracy by at least an order of magnitude.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if there is an unknown factor in these skill checks such as an<br/>
automatic failure range, or the randoms generated are open-ended in same<br/>
fashion, then perhaps it is functioning acceptable but the external factors<br/>
to the random number are very influential.<br/>

heh, i&#39;d be willing to bet they are using the built in c code random number<br/>
generator.<br/>
the problem is you are just using your perceptions of what happens.  and<br/>
what sticks<br/>
out is going to be the anomaly.  if you sat down for an hour and kept<br/>
clicking the song<br/>
icon and tracked how many fails and when they occurred in relation to the<br/>
others, i would<br/>
think that you would find that it is random.</div>
