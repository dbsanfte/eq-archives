&gt;&gt; 	But thats not what i wanted to post, i wanted to post that this test,<br/>
&gt;&gt; while i had fun reading about it, doesnt really mean anything. You would<br/>
&gt;&gt; have to repeat this test at least 3 times for each equipment set to even<br/>
&gt;&gt; start to see meaningful results. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, the point to repeating the tests is to reduce the chance<br/>
&gt;of a fluke timing (lag delayed your computer from displaying<br/>
&gt;the final attack message for 2 seconds).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; And the biggest flaw is the fact that the<br/>
&gt;&gt; sand beetle he tested it on varies in level, which would have another<br/>
&gt;&gt; impact on the numbers. Need to find an npc that spawns at the same lvl<br/>
&gt;&gt; everytime to perform a test like this. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why?  He was timing the time it took him to swing.  The target<br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t matter.<br/>

something here, but that was it. I must of had a massive brain fart cause i<br/>
was thinking he was recording damage, etc too, and he said nothing to that<br/>
affect. Course i still dont think the test means that much without<br/>
repeating it a few times... but as it stands, i cant argue with his testing<br/>
methods. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry about that, sheesh i feel stupid. Hope he reads this before posting a<br/>
flame to my original post, granted i will deserve it but might save some<br/>
bandwidth (and a pair of flame retardant pajamas for me)<br/>
