<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244382732">well to some extent, the rewards at these events are given to the folks that<br/>
tend to roleplay.  in parts of the lanys saga 2 of my guildmates were rewarded<br/>
with items and they were level 30ish at the time.  and it wasn&#39;t cuz they killed<br/>
the uberbaddie or whatever, it&#39;s cuz they roleplayed.  i believe the claw of<br/>
veeshan was also given to roleplayers rather than whatever level 50 happened<br/>
to show up and blast whatever npc happened to be there.  i believe (at least for<br/>
the main storyline dynamic events) that the enjoyment of the event is in participating<br/>
and roleplaying, not killing the npc&#39;s.<br/>

&gt;over the event.  <br/>

&gt;We&#39;re not talking about rare spawns and time spent camping here.  I was<br/>
&gt;totally unable to do much of anything in any of the events I was lucky<br/>
&gt;enough to be present at.  Even though the npcs that were to be fought were<br/>
&gt;white or yellow to me and my group in some cases, they were just being nuked<br/>
&gt;by level 40+&#39;s so there was no point in actually trying to attack them.  The<br/>
&gt;few we did engage would get blasted to smithereens by <br/>
&gt;someone long before our group of four could ever bring it below half.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My complaint is those people who spend more time on the game don&#39;t get more<br/>
&gt;enjoyment out of dynamic events, they get all of it.  Might as well hold all<br/>
&gt;of them on the planes from now on far as I can see.  We&#39;re not talking about<br/>
&gt;levels or items here, we&#39;re talking about being allowed to actually<br/>
&gt;participate.<br/>
