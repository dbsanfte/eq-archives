<b>Subject:</b> Using the Lament song + a minor rant <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-630332187">Last night while in the West Commonlands my party was camping the Dervish<br/>
Cutthroat site. I live in Hawaii so at that time of the night there were<br/>
less than 20 people in the zone and we were the only group at the dervish<br/>
camp.  We only had four people in the party, a paladin, a ranger, a wizard,<br/>
and myself (all around 13th level).  Because we were the only party at the<br/>
site, when we arrived the entire camp was full of cutthroats, around 6 or 7<br/>
total (fortunately no mages).  Knowing that we couldn&#39;t take them all on at<br/>
once, I told the party to stay back and let me do some bard magic.  After<br/>
equipping my mandolin, I proceeded to Lament (sadden) three cutthroats and<br/>
attacked another one.  I ran back out to where my party was and we easily<br/>
dispatched the cutthroats that followed.  Once we were ready, we dispatched<br/>
the ones that I had initially Lamented.  After that, we were able to take on<br/>
the cutthroats one by one as they respawned.<br/>
<br/>
After the initials battles, my party thanked me for using the Lament tactic.<br/>
They all stated they had grouped with bards before and had never seen the<br/>
song used in the manner I had used it.  I thought that was odd because I<br/>
heard about the trick from this forum so assumed a lot of other people used<br/>
it frequently.  <br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s the point of this post?  Well, the bard community needs to educate<br/>
the other classes on everything that we can do for a party.  A lot of other<br/>
players seem to think that our main purpose in a group is to play Selo,<br/>
Hymn, Anthem, and at higher levels, Mana regen.  I&#39;m only 13th level but<br/>
I&#39;ve learned there is a lot more to it than that.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone else knows of similar tactics that only a bard can perform I would<br/>
like to hear about them also.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the rant<br/>
<br/>
After we cleared out the initial cutthroats, we were pretty much able to<br/>
take them on one by one from that point on until we ran into a stumbling<br/>
block.  Here is what happened.  The paladin, the ranger and myself, aided by<br/>
the Anthem could easily handle one cutthroat at a time.  However, our wizard<br/>
insisted on expending his mana with direct damage spells even though the<br/>
tanks were whittling down the cutthroat without taking that much damage.<br/>
The damage we were taking could quickly be healed via the Hymn after the<br/>
combat was over.  What eventually happened was that the fully healed tanks<br/>
ended up standing around while the wizard meditated.  In the meantime, the<br/>
camp fully respawned.  This time, however, there were 3 mages plus a couple<br/>
of thugs.  I tried the Lament trick again but a mage resisted and everyone<br/>
got waxed except the wizard, who gated.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like telling other people how to play their character but how do you<br/>
handle a magic user who insists on wasting his mana?  The group leader kept<br/>
telling him to save mana but it didn&#39;t do any good.  I can see using one<br/>
direct damage spell to help the combat but he would continue spellcasting<br/>
once the cutthroat started to flee.  At this point, no one was in any danger<br/>
because the cutthroat was fighting back.  He created a lot of needless<br/>
downtime by his actions.  Any other recommendation other than finding a<br/>
different group to adventure with?  <br/>
