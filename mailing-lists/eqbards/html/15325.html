&gt; Hmmm maybe I had a streak of very good luck last night.  <br/>
&gt; I was in the penthouse in the Aviak city and I had rooks<br/>
&gt; nodding off left and right when we got in trouble.  I was<br/>
&gt; the lowest level up there at 18 and was not using any<br/>
&gt; instruments.  The sleeping rooks would occasionally wake<br/>
&gt; up swing at me then nod back off.  I just had to be sure I<br/>
&gt; told the others to leave them alone and let them sleep.  <br/>
&gt; The rooks were red to me.  At one time we had a Harrier<br/>
&gt; that we were attacking and 2 sleeping rooks.  Sure sounds<br/>
&gt; to me like it is working properly.<br/>
