&gt; &gt; Heh. Does anyone actually use this song at all? I think they made the<br/>
&gt; &gt; drawback a bit too much, as I found the only way to use it was to play<br/>
&gt; &gt; it just before a fight, then the wizard can med up the extra int it<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets him and maybe get off one more bolt. All the casters I worked with<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly decided it wasn&#39;t worth the extra hassle for what it gave you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Seems I&#39;m arguing about this everywhere I go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People have this mistaken assumption that more mana = more<br/>
&gt; spells.  That is not the case.  The amount of mana a caster<br/>
&gt; has determines the number of spells he can cast without<br/>
&gt; resting/meditating.  The mana regeneration rate determines how<br/>
&gt; many spells he can cast over a given period of time.  You can<br/>
&gt; have 100 mana or 1000 mana, if your mana regeneration rate is<br/>
&gt; unchanged you will still cast the same number of spells/hour. <br/>
&gt; Thus, more mana is advantageous in a single fight; it is not<br/>
&gt; advantageous over the long term (if you use that advantage in <br/>
&gt; a single fight, you pay for it with longer downtime).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; e.g.  Your party tries to take and hold a room.  The cleric<br/>
&gt; has 500 mana.  You attack and are only able to clear the first<br/>
&gt; half of the room before the cleric is out of mana and must<br/>
&gt; meditate.  The cleric meditates.  By the time he is at full<br/>
&gt; mana, the portion of the room you&#39;ve cleared has respawned.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The typical reaction to this type of scenario is &quot;damn, we<br/>
&gt; could&#39;ve done it if we&#39;d only had more mana.&quot;  This is not so.<br/>
&gt; Say the cleric had 1000 mana.  You attack and are able to<br/>
&gt; clear the entire room, with the cleric finishing OOM.  The<br/>
&gt; cleric meditates.  By the time he is at 500 mana, the entire<br/>
&gt; room has respawned, and now the scenario is identical to the<br/>
&gt; previous.  More mana lets you take the room once where you<br/>
&gt; could not before (single fight), but it does not enable you to<br/>
&gt; hold the room (long term).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I would say the use for the song is if you can forsee a<br/>
&gt; situation where you need additional mana for a single fight.<br/>
&gt; Start singing it before, let the casters top off, then start<br/>
&gt; the fight.  That should let them get one or two extra spells<br/>
&gt; in for just this one fight (after they&#39;ve cast the first few<br/>
&gt; spells, you don&#39;t need to keep the int/wis boost up).  Having<br/>
&gt; the effect last longer would be more convenient, but not<br/>
&gt; advantageous.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t this exactly what I described doing above? Maybe I wasn&#39;t clear<br/>
enough. And no, it&#39;s not worth the hassle according to the mages I have<br/>
worked with.<br/>
