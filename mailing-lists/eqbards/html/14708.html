<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891808340">I was going to ask FOH to do just that (I wouldn&#39;t care if I died, I do<br/>
that plenty, and this one would be cool).  However because of the LD<br/>
problems, I won&#39;t even ask (and I know they would say no,<br/>
understandably).  I do have screen shots of me fighting all kinds of<br/>
exciting creatures (spectres, Sand Giants, dragoons to name a few)  I<br/>
die every once in awhile doing that, but its worth it...<br/>
<br/>
Heh a group one day that found me amusing, all backed away from an<br/>
unlooted (with scythe) spectre, and let me pose over it.  I made a print<br/>
out of that shot...<br/>

&gt; &gt; In either case people like me will never, e-e-e-e-ever kill a dragon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;d take you along for the ride.  I wouldn&#39;t mind watching you die<br/>
&gt;   a few times ;-)  You can bellow at Vox if it makes you feel good. 8)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   How&#39;s this?  We kill it and you can come take a screenshot of yourself<br/>
&gt;   beside it?<br/>
