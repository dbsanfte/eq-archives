<div id="ygrps-yiv-186633935">Also can you buy a higher level song than the level you have currently<br/>
obtained and scribe it before you reach the level that you can acutally use<br/>
it?<br/>

&gt; I also got burned by the one lore item limitation.  I tried <br/>
&gt; to buy two copies of<br/>
&gt; two songs in Kelthin and paid for all four but only ended up <br/>
&gt; with one copy of<br/>
&gt; each.  I petitioned and was told, in essence, tough luck.  <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the great<br/>
&gt; documentation Verant.  It appears that this has been <br/>
&gt; corrected a little.  I put<br/>
&gt; a copy of a song in the bank and tried to purchase another <br/>
&gt; copy and it would not<br/>
&gt; sell it to me.  Good work Verant.  I still want my platinum back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do not know if I can buy a song that I have already <br/>
&gt; scribed.  Has anyone tried<br/>
&gt; that?<br/>
