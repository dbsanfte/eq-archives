<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161816180">I had heard a few complaints from newbies that they were now cut off from<br/>
travelling to their guild in Qeynos, but since Kithicor was as safe as ever<br/>
during the day hours I find this unjustified.  It was good to see Verant<br/>
making some real storyline related changes to a zone.  I just wish they<br/>
could effectively do those sort of things at a lower level, say in the 25<br/>
range instead of 40.  Problem is, all those 40+ level characters would flood<br/>
the zone anyway just to kill everything to see what it dropped, depriving<br/>
people of an appropriate level from participating.<br/>
I&#39;ll be really surprised if Asheron&#39;s Call is much of a threat to EQ.  From<br/>
what I saw in Beta it was no match for EQ despite the problems in EQ.<br/>
There were some really sweet weapons a bard could use on some of those<br/>
undead apparently.  sadly I was unable to get any even though most of the<br/>
people I saw fighting them would have zero use for them.  Its a bit<br/>
irritating to watch a 50th level paladin scooping up no drop piercing<br/>
weapons.<br/>

Methinks you are being a bit harsh on Verant.  The Kithicor and Lake Rathe<br/>
events are probably testing grounds for some kind of changes to the zones.<br/>
Verant has so few people on the Test Server that they have to do things on<br/>
live servers to see how things will actually work.  Trust me Verant has 1.5<br/>
million reasons per month to want you to be happy.  With the retail release<br/>
of Asheron&#39;s Call yesterday I think Verant is going to be very aggressive in<br/>
retaining and growing their current player base.  I don&#39;t envy them having<br/>
to compete against Microsoft.<br/>

&gt; Side note: everyone in the zone was saying &quot;I hope hope leave it this<br/>
&gt; way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake rathe when the pets were<br/>
&gt; spawning like crazy and everypne was saying &quot;I hope it stays this way&quot;.<br/>
&gt; TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH of which Verant KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>
&gt; Makes you wonder if they really WANT us happy.<br/>
