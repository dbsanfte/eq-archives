<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-903043964">In my experience, bard hate has nothing to do with faction.  Here&#39;s what<br/>
happens.  Puller grabs a MOB, usually by whacking on it, or shooting it with<br/>
an arrow/spell.  This MOB is then very angry at puller for having done<br/>
damage to it - great! exactly what we want.  Everyone then assists the<br/>
puller and continues to whack on this MOB, keeping its attention mainly off<br/>
the bard.  <br/>
Here&#39;s the problem.  The MOB that is being pulled seldom comes alone, he<br/>
brings along all his closest &quot;friends&quot;.  These &quot;friends&quot; haven&#39;t been<br/>
whacked, so their hate level is relatively low towards the puller, in fact<br/>
this hate level is next to none.  Everyone is busy whacking on the original<br/>
pulled MOB, so these &quot;friends&quot; don&#39;t have any increasing hate level to<br/>
anyone in particular because nobody is hitting them, they just came along to<br/>
lend a hand.  When it comes time for these &quot;friends&quot; to chose a target, they<br/>
naturally focus their attention on the bard since nobody else is really<br/>
doing them any harm, but a bard healing/buffing is considered to be dealing<br/>
damage to the &quot;friends&quot; themselves as far as hate is concerned.<br/>
The result - one MOB attacking the puller/tanks/casters, the other 5 or 6<br/>
MOBS focus on the bard.<br/>
<br/>
How to cut down on this behavior:<br/>
<br/>
1) Don&#39;t start playing songs before the fight begins.  when MOBS first<br/>
arrive, their hate level is at its lowest, and they will go directly for<br/>
you.  Sometimes even the pulled one will jump you as your healing outweighs<br/>
the damage done by the puller.<br/>
<br/>
2) If their are more than 2 MOBS, don&#39;t buff/heal your entire party, unless<br/>
you have a tank that knows to taunt the extra MOBS off of you.  Generally, I<br/>
don&#39;t play buff songs if there are more than 2 MOBS.  Two or more monsters<br/>
focusing their attacks on the bard mean the healer has to concentrate solely<br/>
on you, when the tanks could have been absorbing the damage much better.<br/>
I&#39;ll concentrate on charm<br/>
<br/>
3) The healing song is one of the largest taunts.  Be very careful using<br/>
this in multi MOB situations, it can easily mean your death.<br/>

The possible answer to this is faction. If the extra mob hate for bards<br/>
is done intentionally by Verant, it&#39;s possible they base it on faction.<br/>
As it&#39;s been noted the Avaiks have no faction it&#39;s also possible they<br/>
haven&#39;t been programmed to hate any factions either. I would say if you<br/>
took away the magic thing that makes bards and bard songs the top hated<br/>
thing by mobs you would probably rarely end up at the top of their hate<br/>
list by your own efforts, as you would rarely if ever do more damage<br/>
than anyone else in your party. Even the benefits of the heal song would<br/>
be quickly eclipsed by the first heal cast by a cleric/druid/shaman of<br/>
your level.<br/>
