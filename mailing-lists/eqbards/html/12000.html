<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532584720">Key word was &quot;arbitrary.&quot;  The things you describe are not<br/>
arbitrary - they are required because of the game<br/>
infrastructure (zoning - can&#39;t display a mob if your video<br/>
card doesn&#39;t have the textures loaded in memory), to prevent<br/>
exploits (mob views you warmly but kills you for assisting),<br/>
and to keep the game playable (if you can&#39;t fight/kill Vox,<br/>
what&#39;s the point of having her in the game?).  Giving CT a<br/>
death touch was one of several things they could&#39;ve done to<br/>
increase his difficulty.  Unfortunately, it was probably the<br/>
lamest.<br/>

&gt; You have yo jutify many things when you play EQ.  Why does that Hill<br/>
&gt; Giant who chased me for an hour (in game time) suddenly decide to stop<br/>
&gt; mid swing, with me at death&#39;s door because I stepped through a wide<br/>
&gt; mountain pass (zoning from oasis to S RO).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why does Deputy Bupo who regards me warmly, and I have dealth with<br/>
&gt; personally many times (IE turned in belts) decide to gut me because I<br/>
&gt; happened to be grouped with a slightly naive druid who accidentally<br/>
&gt; caught a goblin spy in his AOE spell (barely hurting the goblin).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why doesn&#39;t Lady Vox learn of this small horde of powerful adeventurers<br/>
&gt; ripping through her defenses, and grab her treasue and get the flock out<br/>
&gt; of there...  In addition when this small horde fails, why doen&#39;t she eat<br/>
&gt; the corpses to prevent a future attack.<br/>
