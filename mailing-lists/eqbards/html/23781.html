<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524417221">Several new tailoring recipes were added with the Velious expansion.  Some<br/>
of these recipes were class specific.  Monks can wear items tailored from<br/>
the pelts of black panthers.  Rangers use tigeraptor pelts.  Not certain if<br/>
any other classes get class specific tailored items.  Does anyone know if<br/>
there are new tailored items for bards only?<br/>
