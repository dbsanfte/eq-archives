<div id="ygrps-yiv-413962256">If you&#39;re describing the place that I think you are, there&#39;s a secret wall,<br/>
well two secret walls actually, but the one you want is opposite the door<br/>
that triggers the other three to open.  This door will lead back outside.<br/>
There&#39;s also a secret wall right next to that door, but this leads deeper<br/>
into the castle.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure this is the same place, becuase I&#39;ve never &quot;dropped&quot; into it,<br/>
but from what you&#39;re describing it sounds like it, and the secret wall<br/>
should lead you back outside right behind the crypt.<br/>

On the subject of Mistmoore.. there&#39;s the crypt area,<br/>
or at least that&#39;s what I call it. There&#39;s holes in<br/>
the floor on either side of the casket that drop you<br/>
into an area below. Can anyone tell me how to get OUT<br/>
of that area? The only door that I saw that opens, <br/>
opens up 3 other doors with creatures that don&#39;t<br/>
exactly like visitors stopping by for brunch.</div>
