<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-733256601">It seems the price per crushbone belt in Firiona Vie is 5gp, still <br/>
not too bad.  Also it seems ruined pelts bottom out at 2gp ea, but i <br/>
have been trying to get 3 :)  I did fairly well with my medium <br/>
quality cat pelts, sold them for about 2pp ea.  I have learned alot <br/>
so far.  My strategy at this point is to let people make me an offer <br/>
and it usually works out ok.  I have about 35pp saved up now so I <br/>
have been auctioning to get a dragoon dirk as was mentioned before.  <br/>
And since I am back in freeport now, I may chance the journey to <br/>
highpass to check for tomahawks :)  Thanks everyone for the <br/>
suggestions!<br/>

&gt; HQ bearpelts are the only skins you&#39;ll get a good price on from the <br/>
commons -- 2pp is prolly about right for the others...that&#39;s 40p a <br/>
stack and much easier to find than HQ bearpelts for the same <br/>
price ...  Another thing you can do is sell deathfist belts (or <br/>
crushbone belts and lego pads, etc.)  These quests are quite good and <br/>
there is no shortage of twinks buying them for up to 5pp each.<br/>
&gt; (I am using prices for Rodcet Nife.  Your server may be a bit <br/>
different).<br/>
&gt; My opinion on tradeskills is that they are designed to be a money <br/>
sink and protect server economies...kind of like 100k horses -- it <br/>
takes cash out of circulation P<br/>
&gt; Better gear means less downtime.  <br/>

&gt; *slaps self on forehead*  I had a HQ bear pelt a couple days back <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; tried to auction it but when i got no response i sold it to a <br/>
&gt; merchant... DOH!  I will never make that mistake again!  What I did <br/>
&gt; last night after reading this message: I took all the cat pelts i <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; looted in freeport back to kelethin (where there are no cats) and <br/>
&gt; sold the medium quality ones for 2pp each.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My biggest question is,  How do I know what prices pelts go for?  I <br/>
&gt; am starting to become quite the fur trapper, and I think I can fund <br/>
&gt; my blacksmithing lessons by selling fur (i am always going back and <br/>
&gt; forth between freeport and g.faydark)  I tried to look for others <br/>
&gt; auctioning pelts but didnt see anything.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; maybe some kind soul can list fair prices for the cat and bear <br/>
pelts, <br/>
&gt; mainly so i don&#39;t feel like i am ripping other PC&#39;s off, but also <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; i dont rip myself off.  I was asking 5pp ea. for HQ cat pelts last <br/>
&gt; night and i got one &quot;no thanks.&quot; was that too high a price?  I did <br/>
&gt; manage to sell 5 medium quality cat pelts for 2pp ea., and a bunch <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; spiderling silks for 1 gp ea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or perhaps there is some internet site out there that lists this <br/>
kind <br/>
&gt; of thing?  all i found so far on the net are people auctioning <br/>
armor <br/>
&gt; and weapons and such...  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Fohat,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Magical weapons are always dropping in price and one of the best <br/>
&gt; times to buy them is during off-peak hours in the Commons.  Why?  <br/>
&gt; Because people get tired of trying to sell stuff and want to get <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; sleep -- You never know what cool deals you&#39;ll find. )<br/>
&gt; &gt; Look for a dragoon dirk if you can.  They go for 30-40pp and when <br/>
&gt; you upgrade, it can sit in your range slot and you&#39;ll still get the <br/>
&gt; MR and dex from it...I carried a dragoon dirk in my range slot <br/>
until <br/>
&gt; I could afford a Runed Bone Fork.  If you don&#39;t have  30-40 pp then <br/>
&gt; hunt bears until you get a HQ pelt and auction it for 40pp or trade <br/>
&gt; for a dragoon dirk -- You might get lucky and a tailor with extra <br/>
&gt; gear in the bank will give you a deal...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Find a friend who has luclin and ask him/her to buy you those <br/>
&gt; songs.  If you are in a guild, it should be easy -- if you are not <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; a guild, look for one -- guilds offer a whole new perspective on <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; game if you join a good one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warsong is a self-only buff and it is a bit better than anthem <br/>
&gt; which is for grouping -- I recommend it highly if you are soloing --<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; but with hymm under your belt, you&#39;ll be a welcome addition to most <br/>
&gt; groups. ...and bellow WILL tell you the damage you do.  I used it <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; pulling until I hit lvl 30.  Damage is unimpressive from this song <br/>
&gt; but it costs no mana and is seldom resisted and is a good interupt <br/>
&gt; when you fight/duel casters.  you&#39;ll get a lot of use from it )<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am nearly ready to take on some Willo-whisps (i am almost lvl <br/>
11)<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I need a good *cheap* magic weapon, as my tarnished broad <br/>
sword <br/>
&gt; &gt; aint gonna cut it.  How much can I expect to pay for a weapon <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; will do the trick?  I am on a tight budget right now, what with <br/>
&gt; &gt; buying songs and learning to smith :)  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, when soloing which do you prefer: Anthem de arms, or <br/>
&gt; Whistling <br/>
&gt; &gt; warsong?  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also Also, how hard is it to get that other level 9 song I heard <br/>
&gt; can <br/>
&gt; &gt; only be gotten in Luclin, &quot;Magical Monologue&quot;  (of course I&#39;ll <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; &gt; to buy the exp first) so that i can save my Platinum and not have <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; buy a magic weapon?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also Also Also does the bellow that bards get at lvl 12 affect <br/>
&gt; &gt; creatures that can only be hit with magic weapons, and does that <br/>
&gt; song <br/>
&gt; &gt; show you how much dammage you are delivering (whereas the chords <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; disonance only say &quot;Large Spider winces&quot; etc)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening!<br/>
