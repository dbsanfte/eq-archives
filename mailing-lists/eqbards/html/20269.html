<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005138960">Alas not a poem or a song, but a few of my thoughts and experiences<br/>
from this past week, and a hope of input from my entertainers-in-arms<br/>
around Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
Apologies for the length, but I&#39;d love to hear everybody&#39;s thoughts on<br/>
this, and hopefully just to call me stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been making a big push to get myself to 47 after a little nagging<br/>
from my constant cleric partner, and from some guildmates so I can<br/>
make an entrance to the planes, with a good xp buffer.<br/>
<br/>
After a week&#39;s holiday from work, I made it through that desperately<br/>
bad 45th level, and another week on, only yesterday, I heard that<br/>
final ding into 47.  However, it&#39;s at this point I run into a little<br/>
crisis of confidence, although maybe it had been coming since that<br/>
45th week.<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to ramble a moment, in no particular order .....<br/>
<br/>
I read the interesting comments on the list about a bard&#39;s role in a<br/>
group, and the flexibility and freedom of choice from a wide range of<br/>
songs that can contribute to a group&#39;s success.  And I couldn&#39;t agree<br/>
more, that was one of the reasons I became a bard in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
But right now I worry that the benefits of a bard in the group are<br/>
something that not too many others appreciate.  And on a more alarming<br/>
note, 2 different people yesterday made a comment after we&#39;d finished<br/>
fighting asking &quot;What does it mean I am no longer berserk?&quot;.  After<br/>
some explaining, they realised that was a song message wearing off.<br/>
But to make it to 50+ and not ever know that bard songs are temporary,<br/>
or even see that message before?<br/>
<br/>
Are there so many people out there that have rarely grouped with a<br/>
bard?  Or have they simply required (and got) an extremely weak tank<br/>
with constant clarity?<br/>
<br/>
Well, to make my way through 45 I finally took the plunge into Lower<br/>
Guk.  I&#39;d successfully avoided the place until now and found it very<br/>
enjoyable.  It&#39;s probably a lot quieter than the heyday, though!<br/>
<br/>
I found myself, unfortunately, as the list holder for the Frenzy<br/>
group.  As the names piled onto the list, and it grew to 34 people<br/>
waiting to get in (about 80% were caster types!) I began to think a<br/>
little about what classes would be best for the group.<br/>
<br/>
Now it&#39;s obvious to say that wherever I go there&#39;s a bard in the<br/>
group, but as I thought about it I wondered at what point would you<br/>
add a bard in preference to another class.  Particularly when spoiled<br/>
for choice as we were.  And I began to struggle wondering what exactly<br/>
I brought to the group other than being an admin assistant with a mana<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
The melee types were all buffed to max by clerics and enchanters.  The<br/>
casters all had their clarity.  Damage shields were handed all round<br/>
by the druid, who also took care of snare and zapped when needed.  So<br/>
there we were, 2 tanks, a cleric, an enchanter, a druid and me.  What<br/>
did the group benefit by having me above, say, another caster or melee<br/>
type?<br/>
<br/>
Yes I added a bit of haste, a bit of damage shield, more clarity, some<br/>
DOTs, a bit of weapon damage.  Some magic resist when the casters<br/>
appeared, the option to fear everything in case of an evac, an option<br/>
to charm, and a stamina boost for the long fights.<br/>
<br/>
And yet I barely needed any of those.  Casters are taken down too fast<br/>
to get a zap off, and are constantly stunned or mezzed in any case.<br/>
My damage shield is barely enough to notice on top of the druid and by<br/>
the mobs being mezzed all the time.  I&#39;ve never needed to charm with<br/>
an enchanter in the group, the DOTs are nice but very much under<br/>
appreciated outside of the class (and resulted in once a few levels<br/>
ago someone saying that I have to tank a bit, soon to be sternly<br/>
corrected by me), my haste is not even understood (see earlier<br/>
comment) and again appears a little weak alongside those enchanters,<br/>
long stamina fights become less of an issue when everything is mezzed<br/>
and the group can rest, and aside from the fear insurance policy,<br/>
clarity is the key benefit.  In which case, were even those benefits<br/>
too subtle to make a difference above, say, a big wizard zap, or an<br/>
extra living shield to protect the casters.<br/>
<br/>
I have the feeling that while we are perhaps the most flexible class,<br/>
with a wide variety of songs that mimic magic, we are given them at<br/>
such a low level as to be of only the slightest benefit to the group.<br/>
We can fill a gap quite well with that flexibility, and yet does that<br/>
not imply that we are therefore only acceptable to a group if there is<br/>
a gap there already?  Constant second-class wanderers?  I&#39;m only glad<br/>
I can sometimes bring a little light relief (and copious amounts of<br/>
alcohol) when I join a group to make myself a good fighting companion.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am suffering a little of the green eyed monster as I see my<br/>
cleric companion being thanked, praised and encouraged to make 49<br/>
whereas I am simply the quiet little girl sitting in the background<br/>
playing something that they don&#39;t understand and generally just<br/>
tolerate.  Hmmm, now I am being stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, thanks for letting me ramble in any case.  I&#39;m struggling<br/>
with the feeling that even though there&#39;s been many a time when people<br/>
beg me not to leave a group, and I&#39;ve made some good friends (perhaps<br/>
all too few) who can appreciate what I can bring and the effort it<br/>
takes to twist 3-4 songs constantly.... I can count on a couple of<br/>
fingers the number of times I&#39;ve heard &quot;Oh yes, we&#39;ve got a bard now!&quot;<br/>
In my early 30s for some strange reason I seem to recall.<br/>
<br/>
After that final ding to 47 yesterday I enjoyed a little time with my<br/>
younger sisters (an enchanter and ranger).  Have I simply got the high<br/>
level blues?  Have I had an unlucky week grouping with entirely the<br/>
wrong people? (A bit of a disappointment as many of those I mention<br/>
are guildmates, no names disclosed though)  <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s got my gripe off my chest, I hope everyone doesn&#39;t mind me<br/>
offloading it into a fairly safe environment among some supportive and<br/>
understanding fellow bards.  After much enjoyment through my career up<br/>
to now, I worry that I&#39;ve passed my peak and burned out my voice<br/>
singing the high notes while getting beaten up.  And yet I don&#39;t want<br/>
to retire, I have plenty to give ... just few people seem to realise<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Take care everyone.<br/>
