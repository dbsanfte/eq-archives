<div id="ygrps-yiv-660992123">I agree with you.  Changing the binding policy will change the fighting dynamic.<br/>
Melee/hybrids will get to spend more time adventuring instead of wasting time<br/>
running across multiple zones to get their corpse.  As a casual gamer who<br/>
doesn&#39;t get to play that often, this is why I support a change to the policy.<br/>
Also, groups will be less likely to break up if their tanks die because they now<br/>
don&#39;t have to wait a long time for them to return.    <br/>
<br/>
I think one of Verant&#39;s concerns is that if they change the bind policy, it<br/>
would be easier for groups to take out the uber-mobs like Lady Vox.<br/>
Melee/hybrid classes could just loot their corpse and reenter the battle.  What<br/>
if the rules were changed to reflect something like along these lines:<br/>
<br/>
1) Any class can get bound anywhere.  Melee/hybrids get the option to Players<br/>
without the bind spell<br/>
2) If a character gets killed, and the mob that killed them is still alive when<br/>
they reappear at their bind point,  that character can no longer do damage to<br/>
the mob.  This would not apply if the character was resurrected. <br/>
<br/>
There are probably several different ways this could be worked but I think<br/>
something along these lines would be required as a tradeoff for the change to<br/>
the binding policy <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Very good point.  From what I have gathered, it seems the biggest complaint<br/>
&gt; about giving a melee class the ability to bind, or be bound by a caster, is<br/>
&gt; that it would change the fighting dynamic.  And it obviously would.  That<br/>
&gt; being said, the one major point that has not been proposed by other players<br/>
&gt; is a sense of difficulty or loss with getting a melee player bound.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Add in song difficulty and reagents, coupled with real EXP loss to the<br/>
&gt; person getting bound (2 full bubbles of lost exp would really make a melee<br/>
&gt; person question getting bound or not, of course the song singer should take<br/>
&gt; considerable less exp loss :=) ). and the argument becomes less clear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>
