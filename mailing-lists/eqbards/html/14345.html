<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719764364">Good point, Harmonic.<br/>
Warning removed.  Apologies for not being more aware.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Steelwolf, please consider this your first AND second <br/>
warning.<br/>
First, for posting the flame.  Although he wrote it - he sent it <br/>
privately.  You posting it makes it your own responsibility.<br/>
Second warning for posting what is OBVIOUSLY private mail to the public <br/>
list in a deliberate attempt to make someone look bad.  Frankly, that is <br/>
unacceptable. You&#39;re an adult - or at least make claims to that.  Please <br/>
try to act like it in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I should oughta give you a third for making me look bad - but that&#39;s my own <br/>
damned fault for not paying more attention.  Twitchy trigger-finger, I <br/>
guess.  Again, my apologies, Harmonic.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and this thread is STILL KABONG&#39;d.  Let&#39;s talk about the Archmage <br/>
Answers instead.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;    If you feel the need to post my private messages to you on this list<br/>
&gt;    again (and make it look like I posted it to the list itself, instead<br/>
&gt;    of where it really went, which was your personal mailbox), I am going<br/>
&gt;    to suggest you be removed from the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    That is one thing I cannot tolerate.  I would be much more careful<br/>
&gt;    in the future for your own benefit.  Much more careful...<br/>
