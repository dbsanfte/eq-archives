<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398738291">There is no maybe about it.  My hand to hand is 100.  The formula<br/>
for this skill for Bards appears to be 3 x level plus 3 (skill stopped<br/>
increasing at 99 when I was level 32, then went to 100 right away when I<br/>
leveled up to 33).  It does appear to be capped, but I have not tried<br/>
training it at the guild yet.  Too bad that some skills are arbitrarily<br/>
capped.  Seems like it would not be too hard to make skills more difficult<br/>
to improve in without completely cutting them off.  If Asheron&#39;s Call allows<br/>
truly custom characters, it will have at least that advantage over EQ.<br/>

&gt; and try to train some more points into the skill. <br/>
