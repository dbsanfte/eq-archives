<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Hey! Who says fishing isn&#39;t worth the time spent on it?<br/>
&gt;&gt; All of my characters do fishing as a major pasttime of their lives!<br/>
&gt;&gt; Fish sell for 2s each! And when you fish up sandals (Meara is still<br/>
&gt;&gt; wearing Tattered Sandals she fished up), fish scales (Water Breathing<br/>
&gt;&gt; anyone?) and Rusty daggers, they don&#39;t even use a lure up!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;And if you spent the same time killing mobs you&#39;d probably come out with<br/>
&gt;more cash and more exp for the same time spent. Fishing at low levels is<br/>
&gt;only worth the time spent on it if you put an extremely low value on<br/>
&gt;your time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So? I get SICK of running around killing mobs all the time. Sometimes I<br/>
like to be calm, not worry about dying, interact with other people. This<br/>
is not, for me, a game that is all about leveling, and leveling alone.<br/>
Otherwise, why would my highest character only be 19 when I started her<br/>
back on May 8?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say that fishing was the most efficient use of your time. (it is<br/>
one of the safest. I have never been killed while fishing) But then, neither<br/>
is running to Kelethin from Qeynos at level 7 to buy your level 8 song --&gt;<br/>
and<br/>
then having to go back at 11 to get that song as well. However, I know<br/>
a level 50 bard who can&#39;t find her way around Rivervale -- not even to<br/>
the bank. I don&#39;t have any characters near that, but I can give you all the<br/>
directions there you want -- including where to find shurikens.<br/>
<br/>
How many level 8 characters go deep into the Third Gate of Neriak? Level 9s<br/>
in Solusek A?  How do you think Meara got her last name of &quot;Daring&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
That same level 50 bard can&#39;t find her way across the Rathe Mountains. I<br/>
can&#39;t quite give other people directions yet, but I can run through without<br/>
a map. There are many many things to do in Everquest that do not involve<br/>
getting the optimal ratio between time spent and experience received.<br/>
