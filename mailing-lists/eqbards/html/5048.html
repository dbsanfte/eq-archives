<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072796967">Hmm I rather like the fact that there isn&#39;t a guide on what price to sell<br/>
items at.  I know that I have been overcharged for several items that I have<br/>
bought, but I bought them anyway because I wanted them.  Kind of adds to the<br/>
mystique of the game.  The item may not necessarily be worth that much to<br/>
the general populace, but to me it was worth every penny.  I have also<br/>
overcharged people for certain items.  For instance when I was a young lad<br/>
me and my hunting partner were in Crushbone and we were trying to get a 2<br/>
handed dwarven axe off of Lord Darish (sp?) and he died doing it.  Well when<br/>
we went and sold it, we overcharged for it because we went through a lot to<br/>
get it.  And we sold it.  :)  Just my 2 coppers worth.<br/>

&gt; The more I think about it, I think someone needs to set out a<br/>
&gt; full out price<br/>
&gt; scale of items for everyone to use at least as a reference.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; consistantly annoyed to see people trying to oversell items<br/>
&gt; to people who<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t have a feel for what an item is worth. </span></blockquote></div>
