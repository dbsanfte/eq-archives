<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587276783">Short answer - yes, you get xp - no problem. Longer answer - keep reading.<br/>
<br/>
I got over a bub - call it a bub and and 3/16ths xp - for the night - 4<br/>
hours. And we lost about half our kills to a killstealer wizard but that&#39;s<br/>
another story.  It was as good as the XP rates killing chickens.<br/>
<br/>
At low levels - a 4 level difference has a greater effect than at higher<br/>
levels.  There are caps in place to prevent simple xp twinking.  And the<br/>
level differences are one of them. The ability to damage and to get xp from<br/>
mobs is another. But first examine the distributions of allowed xp.<br/>
<br/>
Low level:<br/>
<br/>
4 warrior<br/>
5 pallie<br/>
9 wizzie<br/>
---------<br/>
18 total <br/>
<br/>
They go off and burn down a gnoll guard that awards them with 100 xp points<br/>
<br/>
warrior gets 4/18th<br/>
pallies gets 5/18th<br/>
wizzie gets 9/18 - or half the xp (and talks them into trying a badder mob<br/>
next time)<br/>
<br/>
so here the warrior really gets robbed<br/>
<br/>
Now at the 20&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
21 bard<br/>
25 cleric<br/>
26 warrior<br/>
28 wizzie<br/>
--- <br/>
100 total<br/>
<br/>
bard gets 21/100&#39;s<br/>
cleric gets 25/100&#39;s<br/>
warrior gets 26/100&#39;s<br/>
wizzie gets 28/100&#39;s (and makes an excuse to leave the group so he can go<br/>
solo)<br/>
<br/>
So, the low guy gets 20% where the others get 25% or so.  The difference<br/>
between 1/5th and 1/4th is much better than 1/4th and 1/2th.<br/>
<br/>
Now add in the safety factor.  I didn&#39;t die and suffer the xp loss.  I&#39;d<br/>
rather be in a group with higher levels who know what they are doing than be<br/>
the high level in a group that is trying new things.  This is when I am<br/>
going purely for xp.  But I still can&#39;t resist the green bandit camps and<br/>
one day I shall triumph!  I don&#39;t care if there are 10 of them - I just made<br/>
my level and I am powerfull! LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
Seriously - things change over 20 - I am comfortable with eeven a level diff<br/>
of 8.  Over 25, it could go to 10 easy, in 30&#39;s and up 15 and more prolly<br/>
wont matter.  Try some numbers and see.<br/>
<br/>
One problem with being low in a group with highers is the mobs they can hurt<br/>
- you prolly can&#39;t hurt. As a bard, you can make them better at what they do<br/>
so they can be more effective - but you wont do direct damage on the deep<br/>
reds they attack.<br/>
<br/>
I was in a group last night at the chicken ranch.  We filled up and<br/>
immediately they started in: &#39;we got 6 now - lets do an avocet!&quot;  Well duh,<br/>
maybe 4 of the 6 can hurt an avo but 2 of us can&#39;t.  It don&#39;t matter if you<br/>
get 20 more of us - hitting an avo for 1 dmg per round is gonna be death.<br/>
And there is a level cap between you and the dead mob.  <br/>
<br/>
Say you group with a couple mid to high 20&#39;s and you are 20.  So they are<br/>
strong casters, got SoW and they ping-pong a cylops. You get no xp because<br/>
the mob is too high for you. Not because of the level differences between<br/>
you and your party.<br/>
<br/>
So there are all different aspects of level diffs and xp to look at.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>		Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but with a group of people that<br/>
high up in level<br/>
		(up to 7 above you), isn&#39;t it true that you&#39;d get very<br/>
little to no<br/>
		experience from the fights? I remember when I was level 5<br/>
and my friend was<br/>
		level 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting<br/>
experience when we were<br/>
		grouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that<br/>
even when the<br/>
		levels are closer, the people with the higher levels get<br/>
more experience<br/>
		than the lower levels regardless of who does the most<br/>
damage. Of course if<br/>
		you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I<br/>
was just curious<br/>
		if you got any experience from it.<br/>
