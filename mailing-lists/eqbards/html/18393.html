<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430060691">Greeting Barrd!  Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I am currently still exploring Kunark myself.  I have a wizard 31 who got a<br/>
good group in the Frontier Mts - right by the zone to lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
They pulled stuff to the zone and we killed it.  Also, saw some friends in<br/>
Timours Deep (sp?) - there are several islands with various things - one has<br/>
a cookie cutter copy of the SK aviak treehouse but its populated with<br/>
bigger, badder birties (spiroks) - some blue to me at 51 and down from<br/>
there. Might want to explore some.<br/>
<br/>
As far as karnors, that seems to be a higher level dungeon.  Again I dont<br/>
know much about it.  Was there one time and saw level 50+&#39;s training to the<br/>
zone and others getting trained out.  Your mana song will be welcome in all<br/>
the groups you join but you need to be careful to stay in groups that fight<br/>
things that you can survive.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and good hunting,  keep us posted on how you do!<br/>

&gt;     Wow!  Can&#39;t say enough good things about the exp mi... err goblin mine<br/>
&lt;g&gt; in Ill Omen.  Went there on a tip from a guildmate at 29 Friday night,<br/>
and am now halfway to 31 (and that&#39;s with studying for finals, *and* getting<br/>
a tp to WC to go buy songs in FP, HPH, and Qeynos, then insta-porting back<br/>
to Kunark via the Qeynos Arena and a helpdul young warrior.    heeheehee).<br/>
Even though the warlords still give good experience, the other critters are<br/>
kinda slow :o/<br/>
&gt;     So, any ideas on where I can go next for great solo exp?  I&#39;ld like to<br/>
hang around Kunark so I can be here for 32, and weasel my way  (using<br/>
manasong as leverage :op  ) into one of the Karnor groups getting all the<br/>
nifty bard items.<br/>
