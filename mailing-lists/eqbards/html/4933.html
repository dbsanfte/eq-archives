<div id="ygrps-yiv-49594407"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Funny thing is 7 is all I can think of right offhand.  I still think bards<br/>
&gt; are a great class, most of my gripes are little things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Speaking of little gripes:<br/>
<br/>
1) Add the instrument type to the info you get when you right-click on a<br/>
   song in the spellbook or a spell gem - right now the only in-game<br/>
   source of this info is at the vendor before you buy it.<br/>
<br/>
2) Fix the Drum so it doesn&#39;t look like a flute.<br/>
<br/>
3) Fix the Drum animation so it doesn&#39;t look like I&#39;m strumming a Lute.<br/>
<br/>
4) Make it so I don&#39;t jam the wrong end of my Horn into my head.  Ow.<br/>
<br/>
5) Add an option to turn off Bard spam.<br/>
<br/>
6) Have one-shot songs like Bellow turn themselves off so we don&#39;t have to<br/>
   hit them a second time.<br/>
<br/>
7) Fix that bug that only I seem to get once in a while where my songs<br/>
   get stuck on.<br/>
<br/>
8) Have a message for Disruptive Dischord.<br/>
<br/>
9) Make instruments say which skill they use like weapons do (ie Mino Horn)<br/>
<br/>
10) Animations for Wind.  [are there any?  I have a mino horn and a flute<br/>
    from the N Karana bard, neither have animations ]<br/>
<br/>
Any others?<br/>
<br/>
