<div id="ygrps-yiv-22023798">This game is very enjoyable even as a casual player, which is what I have to<br/>
call myself, Ive been playing since release and Im still a bard of almost 25<br/>
levels, now I do have many more personalities, in their teens, and here is<br/>
why...... At this level my bard has to almost all the time be in a group to<br/>
advance, without takeing 3 steps back for every one forward........ It is<br/>
harder to get in a group and get established in a location if you have<br/>
limited time...... Ever tried to get in groups in HK, can take hour or more.<br/>
Which is why I have many characters in the mid teens, I can solo them.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;m going to have to agree Everquest is a game for<br/>
&gt;&gt; people who have lots of time on their hands. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; something the casual player is going to have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; either accept or move on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is your point? That people that don&#39;t spend a<br/>
&gt;lot of time in EQ should move on? I know people that<br/>
&gt;only play one hour every other day and have a great<br/>
&gt;amount of fun.<br/>
