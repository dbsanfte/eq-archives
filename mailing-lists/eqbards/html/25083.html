<div id="ygrps-yiv-169471833">It takes a bit of coordination when a bard and enchanter are in the same<br/>
group.  But if they work together and both know what the plan is, it can<br/>
work great.  I have seen far too many enchanters commit suicide because they<br/>
do not follow one simple rule:<br/>
<br/>
1) Let the tanks - tank.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that they panic when they see multiple mobs.  Crowd control is<br/>
their job after all and things seem to be out of control.  Then they get a<br/>
resist and a mobs turns on them. So, they AE stun.  Now even if they mez the<br/>
mob that resisted, they have the other ones beating on them. This situation<br/>
can go down hill fast.  I find that if they just wait and let the tanks<br/>
tank, let the bard get one mezzed then they can pick another one to put to<br/>
sleep.  Or, if they pick 1 mob to work on at a time. Attempt mez, if<br/>
resisted, back away from the group, let the bard mez the mob attacking the<br/>
chanter.  Also, working with a shaman and/or cleric is great too.  The sha<br/>
can slow and the cleric can stun.  In any case,  the most important thing is<br/>
not not AE stun, work one mob at a time and let the tanks - tank.  The bard<br/>
can do the first mez on a mob and then tank it while the ench puts it to<br/>
sleep long term - but again - you need to coordinate this plan ahead of<br/>
time.  And I have been here done this - as bard, chanter and cleric - team<br/>
work, works great.<br/>
