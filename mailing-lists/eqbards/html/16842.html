<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Normal.  In a good group it shouldn&#39;t STAY on you though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, during the fight the mobs would decide that I was a <br/>
&gt; better target<br/>
&gt; quite frequently.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you have another healer besides yourself?  If it is at all possible,<br/>
don&#39;t sing hymn during battle.  That song was probably your biggest taunt.<br/>
If you&#39;re the only healer & have to sing it in battle then put your Dirk<br/>
away &lt;glares enviously at Cerulia for owning a dirk&gt; and equip your lute.<br/>

&gt; level 9 Paladin<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; was kind of irritating because he seemed to accidentally loot <br/>
&gt; out of turn a<br/>
&gt; lot..:P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one of the seven deadly sins that make me leave a group.  The other 6<br/>
are not calling pulls, ignoring medding groupmates, not assisting pullers,<br/>
acting like a wizard if your not, not buffing if you can, and being rude to<br/>
other players.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Plus he would say silly things like how &quot;pimp&quot; the soul fire <br/>
&gt; looks..etc..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, I guess there&#39;s an eigth deadly sin: being kewl.  ;^)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway I dont know if it was his lousy taunt or if bard songs <br/>
&gt; ultra aggro<br/>
&gt; mobs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably the former.  Although I&#39;d check to make sure the paladin&#39;s got a<br/>
decent weapon, since you&#39;ve got a dirk and are a level up on him.  &lt;glares<br/>
at Cerulia for owning a dirk&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How about some group tactics for bards lessons?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bah!  By the time you get this you&#39;ll be level 11 and I&#39;ll go back to being<br/>
the list newbie!  &lt;glares enviously again&gt;<br/>

Peace<br/>
Evulia, youngest bard on the list, again...</div>
