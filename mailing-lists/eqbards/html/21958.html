&gt;a Blessed Ring of Nife.  The Drums were way out of my price range, but I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t imagine why anyone would sell them to a merchant even if they were<br/>
&gt;quitting their bard.  The Ring of Nife is also very useful and was only 2pp<br/>
&gt;or so.  I can&#39;t wait to see the look on our cleric&#39;s face the next time he<br/>
