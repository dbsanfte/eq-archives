<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129095355">If they wanted us to be able to mem songs faster they could just give us<br/>
meditate with a really low skill cap (like 1).  As far as I can tell, my<br/>
meditate skill has nothing to with the speed at which I mem spells (only<br/>
that when I have meditate its ALOT faster)<br/>
