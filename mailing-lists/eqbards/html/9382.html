<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484532247">That&#39;s not quite accurate.  Glares Threateningly is KoS, but usually a flute<br/>
will raise that to Dubious.  Its the Scowls ready to attack, that no-one can<br/>
seem to get their faction to move out of.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I misunderstanding something?  I thought with the patch we could hit<br/>
magic creatures now if we had magic gloves OR magic instruments?  I have<br/>
magic gauntlets but have yet to test it.<br/>

Thats a shame then.  I was really hoping that the patch made special<br/>
instruments give a bonus to our songs.  Guess we can hope that something<br/>
didn&#39;t go right with the patch and that Verant will fix it.  One thing I<br/>
will test the next time I get the chance is the Carillon song with a Mino<br/>
horn against a mob that is KOS to me.  With a normal flute, you can&#39;t<br/>
improve your faction high enough to get out of the KOS range (according to<br/>
this list).  Maybe with a magical Mino horn, you can now raise KOS mobs to<br/>
dubious or apprehensive.   <br/>
<br/>
Kinda wish our instruments used 1HB skill instead of hand to hand.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never used a 1HB weapon before and need to work on that skill:-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think that&#39;s why they made our instruments magical.  They<br/>
&gt; could make our punches magical via magical gloves, but having<br/>
&gt; a non-magical instrument equipped overrode that.  So I think<br/>
&gt; they fixed it by just making all our instruments magical, then<br/>
&gt; made a big deal about it in the patch message.<br/>
