Our Eye of Zomm is pretty short duration, maybe 30 seconds.  Long enough to<br/>
be really irritating (since<br/>
I&#39;ve never figured out how to get unlocked from the Eye when I need to), but<br/>
too short to be useful.<br/>
Besides, everyone I know kills Eyes on sight.  There&#39;s something<br/>
atavistically pleasant about killing<br/>
things with one blow, apparently.<br/>

&gt; It might not be so useful in tree-infested areas, though.<br/>
