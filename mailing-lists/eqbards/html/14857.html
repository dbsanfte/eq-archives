<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071392642">I&#39;ve been meaning to post this for the last week.  Got too rilled<br/>
  up with posting rants and projects at work.<br/>
 <br/>
  I was testing chains with an enchanter friend and a shaman friend.<br/>
<br/>
  Test subject was ice giants.  L43 ice giants hit max 116, and have<br/>
  on occasion quad attacked me.  Triple attack is not unheard of, and<br/>
  they almost always double attack.  It&#39;s very easy to see speed <br/>
  differences with these npcs because if they are not slowed down<br/>
  they usually wipe you out in a few rounds.<br/>
<br/>
  With chains on, will Togors/Shiftless will stick to the npc?<br/>
<br/>
  To test this, I pulled an ice giant with chains and kept chaining<br/>
  it until the shaman or enchanter would slow it down.  I then stopped<br/>
  using chains.  The ice giant was swinging at the speed I would expect<br/>
  for those spells applied.<br/>
<br/>
  With Togors/Shiftless already on the npc, will chains break it?<br/>
<br/>
  I pixie striked an ice giant out and let it chase me around<br/>
  until the shaman or enchanter would cast on it.  Then chains<br/>
  were applied and were left to wear off.  The ice giant did<br/>
  not return to it&#39;s typical crushing speed.  It stayed at it&#39;s<br/>
  slowed pace.<br/>
<br/>
  Which is more powerful?<br/>
<br/>
  Well all the tools I&#39;ve seen to analyze the spells conclude that<br/>
  chains and shiftless deeds are equivalent in the attack speed<br/>
  amount, and togors falls a little behind them.  This just isn&#39;t<br/>
  the case.  With togors/shiftless on an npc, I can count seconds<br/>
  before they attempt to swing.  With chains, it&#39;s kinda like a <br/>
  small visual decrease but nothing fancy.  Chains is nice for <br/>
  the mobility effect, but can be outdone by other atkspeed spells.<br/>
<br/>
  I also camped the live side king a week and a half ago and had similar<br/>
  results with both a shaman and enchanter in the group.  Chains just<br/>
  didn&#39;t seem to impact the speed component at all, yet it provided<br/>
  the negative movement component just fine.<br/>
<br/>
  I need someone to confirm these conclusions.  I&#39;d prefer the tests<br/>
  be done on ice giants, because it is glaringly evident when they <br/>
  attack if their speed is normal, chained, or togors/shiftless.<br/>
