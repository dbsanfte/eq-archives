&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the topic of playing nice,,, last night my almost<br/>
&gt; 17lvl enchanter was trying to kill gnolls in highpass<br/>
&gt; with a 19 druid for a partner.  We were doing fine,<br/>
&gt; till this Lvl 50 Necro arrived and said... &quot;sorry to<br/>
&gt; do this to you guys, but i need the faction&quot; he then<br/>
&gt; proceeded to kill everything in site till i gave up<br/>
&gt; and left 30 minutes later.   That is in reallity how<br/>
&gt; sharing works...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what did the guide say after you petitioned this lack of sharing?<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t follow the &quot;play nice&quot; policy at all.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t let anyone walk over me regardless of their level. If I can&#39;t<br/>
convince them to share, then I&#39;d petition Verant and wait.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I&#39;d do is contact the person&#39;s guildmaster to find out if<br/>
this is an acceptable form of behavior from a guild member. I&#39;ve been<br/>
fortunate to talk to several guildmasters who have reigned in one of theirs<br/>
after a complaint.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, what level do enchanters get charm? Couldn&#39;t you have charmed the<br/>
creatures away from him, worse comes to worse?<br/>
