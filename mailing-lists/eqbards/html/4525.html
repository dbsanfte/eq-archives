&gt; &gt; &gt;What do you folks think of bards in general?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like my bard mainly for two reasons:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A. Selo&#39;s Accelerando.<br/>
&gt; B. Ability to use both magic and fighting skills adequately without mana<br/>
&gt; concerns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only other class I like near as much as a Bard is the Cleric class. I<br/>
&gt; thoroughly enjoyed that class as well. Magic & Fighting - but with the<br/>
mana<br/>
&gt; to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
And not having to worry about standing still to cast. </span></blockquote></div>
