Unfortunately, the training stuff away from the zone line doesnt work,<br/>
matter of fact, it seems to have the opposite effect. Quite a few people on<br/>
tunare had the same idea and yeah, i got picked for train duty. I was quite<br/>
happy to do it though if it ment an easier breakin for everybody else. I<br/>
basically did everything you suggested except i had no invis (the idea was<br/>
to attract attention, not avoid it) and the end results where disastrous. I<br/>
tried doing several patterns, sometimes running in circls around the gate<br/>
hill and then running far off, othertimes just tagging the stuff inbetween<br/>
the corner and the impt tower... etc. All of em resulted in the same thing,<br/>
one full zone of uber pissed mobs looking for something to kill. It just<br/>
made a big backlash that fell back with a mighty THWACK on anybody that<br/>
tried to zone it or was in the corner. I lived plenty long enough to get<br/>
stuff far away, matter of fact i made it to cazic himself all but once<br/>
(tried punching him but everytime i got close he dt&#39;d me heh). Several<br/>
other people tried this including big ogre warriors, troll sk&#39;s etc. End<br/>
result was all the same, just stirred everything up with out sufficiently<br/>
clearing the corner/gate hill. I have a tutorial for safely entering the<br/>
PoF at<br/>

pic, basically just a bunch of common sense.  My bard and necro both have a<br/>
flawless zone in record to the pof, and the bard got his full suit of<br/>
imbrued before verant moved it to scorn banshees in the PoH. <br/>
<br/>
I wish the train method worked, and i am not completly ruling it out, if<br/>
you can figure out a way of making it work please SHARE =)<br/>
