<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071822142">Ok, I pulled my log from last night and checked...  I actually had 8<br/>
charm resists (long enough for our cleric to die) in a row before the<br/>
level 51 bard in our party charmed the Spectral Knight for the first<br/>
time.  After her charm broke, she charmed it again and when that broke<br/>
I was able to take control of it and sit it by the castle as we moved<br/>
to zone.  After that she charmed it 3 or 4 more times while people<br/>
made their way to zone and then I charmed it once as she made her way<br/>
out this time with no resist.  Definately a con yellow at level 50<br/>
too, and the other bard said it conned white to her at level 51.  I<br/>
got summoned by the Knight first and then the cleric second, probably<br/>
from healing me which was his death sentence.<br/>
<br/>
The level 51 bard barely got resisted by the Knight where as I started<br/>
with 8 in a row (I almost never get resisted...).  Don&#39;t know for sure<br/>
if the resists were level dependent or if it was because of the<br/>
infamous Verant semi-random number generator.<br/>
<br/>
On an interesting side note, I resisted 2 gravity fluxes that<br/>
encounter as well... looks like our cleric took one at full force<br/>
though.  I had thought we had a well balanced party (level 51 Troll<br/>
warrior, Level 51 Paladin, Level 51 bard, Level 51 druid, Level 51<br/>
cleric and me, level 50 bard) but we got literally ripped to shreads<br/>
incredibly fast.<br/>

&gt; Nah, something else is going on here.  I was able to charm the level<br/>
51 mob also so it isn&#39;t capped at my<br/>
&gt; level... Probably worth doing some testing to try to figure out what<br/>
the exact cap is.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have heard rumors that Bravura does NOT cap 49 but caps at the<br/>
Bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; level.  On the Concert Hall someone posted they charmed a level 51<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gullerback last night.... I will try and confirm this tonight. </span></blockquote></div>
