<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250223745"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That it took a level 8ish mob 20+ spells for me (L30) to see<br/>
&gt; one complete resist should tell you something about how<br/>
&gt; difficult this check is.  I was singing Elemental Rhythms at<br/>
&gt; the time with drum equipped, which put my MR in the 80s and FR<br/>
&gt; in the 70s.  I wasn&#39;t trying too hard to keep it up though, so<br/>
&gt; it may have dropped to my natural 35/25.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, you sure you just haven&#39;t noticed? I&#39;ve resisted (with a resist<br/>
message) a good 30% - 50% of all spells I&#39;ve been hit with when Endure<br/>
Magic&#39;d. I have no +magic resist equipment.<br/>
<br/>
With my bard, dwarven tunic and elemental rhythms, I resist at much at 70%<br/>
of the spells from a blue con. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always gotten plenty of resists, on all my chars, from 1 - 40<br/>
<br/>
