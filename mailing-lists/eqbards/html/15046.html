&gt; When you put your int stuff on, your mana bar goes from 5 full bubs to 3 and<br/>
&gt; a half bubs and you can get it to fill back in if you wait long enough?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup, unless you started off at full mana, in which case you<br/>
automatically get the extra mana (at least, no white appeared<br/>
when I played Elegy at FM, whereas the white increased when<br/>
I played Elegy at less than FM).<br/>

Your max mana has absolutely  N O T H I N G  to do with the<br/>
rate at which people can cast spells.  Buffing a group will<br/>
take just as long whether you have 500 mana or 2000 mana.  A<br/>
L45 cleric with 500 mana can cast as many superior heals per<br/>
hour as a L45 cleric with 2000 mana.<br/>
<br/>
Only your mana regeneration rate (Clarity, manastones, etc)<br/>
can change the time it takes to cast a spell N times.  All the<br/>
extra mana does is give you more flexibility to &quot;save up&quot; mana<br/>
for a rainy day when things turn bad and you have to do a mana<br/>
dump.  The cost of this of course is that you spend extra time<br/>
medding to gain back that extra mana.<br/>

&gt; anyhow?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, you can use it to slightly enlarge their mana reservoir<br/>
for a big fight.  Once they&#39;ve cast their first spell and used<br/>
up that bit of extra mana they&#39;ve saved up, there&#39;s no point<br/>
to playing Elegy anymore.  (Well, supposedly int decreases<br/>
your resist rate and wis decreases your fizzle rate, so maybe<br/>
there is a reason.  But there is no mana-based reason to<br/>
continue playing it after the first couple spells have been<br/>
cast.)<br/>
