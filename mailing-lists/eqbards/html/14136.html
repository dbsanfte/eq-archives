<div id="ygrps-yiv-976161234">The Guise of the Deceiver did and still does give Ultravision. I am not<br/>
sure if the Guise of Deception does or not, I will try and check and get<br/>
back to you if no one posts an answer before then. The ultravision was a<br/>
big reason why everyone wanted a mask, and not just large races for it&#39;s<br/>
economy-shirnk effect (DE Form). Humans in particular got a real bonus<br/>
from the Ultravision.<br/>
