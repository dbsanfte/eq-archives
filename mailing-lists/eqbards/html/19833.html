<b>Subject:</b> Song (parody): Closet Male <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-960604726">It&#39;s been a slow day (both at work and on the board, I&#39;ve noticed), so I got<br/>
round to finishing off another song.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was funny how some guys react to the female Wood-Elf<br/>
characters. /ooc comments and wolf-whistles abound, but do they really know<br/>
who&#39;s at the other end of the keyboard...?<br/>
<br/>
When was the last time you heard a female player get all hot and bothered at<br/>
the sight of any of the male character models?<br/>
<br/>
To the tune of &#39;Centerfold&#39; by The J. Geils Band<br/>
<br/>
Does she cast? Does she tank?<br/>
Does she run with SoW?<br/>
My blonde haired Wood Elf Druid<br/>
Always made me lose control.<br/>
<br/>
She was clad in leather<br/>
So tight it was a sin<br/>
I&#39;d lose myself among the trees<br/>
As I ran through Kelethin<br/>
<br/>
Months go by I&#39;m lookin&#39; through Hotmail&#39;s directory<br/>
I find my EQ hunny, and her real name is Geoffrey!<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS<br/>
I can&#39;t inhale<br/>
I think I&#39;ll quit this game and bail<br/>
My angel is a closet male<br/>
Angel is a closet male<br/>
(Repeat)<br/>
<br/>
Laughed and joked and beamed a smile<br/>
As we were medding all the while<br/>
Sent me *hugs* before she logged<br/>
I grinned from ear to ear<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d go walkin&#39; in Steamfont<br/>
To make her mine is what I want<br/>
I told my friends of my intent<br/>
But they just thought me queer<br/>
<br/>
I found old Geoffrey&#39;s webpage<br/>
And a section with some pics<br/>
Not only was he married<br/>
But his kids were 3 and 6!<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS<br/>
<br/>
What burns me, I stop to think<br/>
Armour, weapons, she was my Twink<br/>
I gave her on the first of Spring<br/>
A Silver Rose Engagement Ring<br/>
<br/>
Confronted him the next day<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s the big idea?&quot;<br/>
I challenged him to a duel<br/>
But he fairly spanked my rear<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played this game since Beta 4<br/>
I never got involved before<br/>
Here&#39;s me thinking it was roleplay<br/>
Turns out it&#39;s his idea of foreplay!<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS<br/>
<br/>
