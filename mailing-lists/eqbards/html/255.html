<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-917788125">This is a &quot;balance&quot; change. I beleive that Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby was reduced I <br/>
am not sure about Kelin&#39;s Lament. It worked fine for me last <br/>
night?????<br/>
<br/>
The anoying part is that we are not told about the changes. This <br/>
can lead to deaths of entire groups all blaiming the Bard for their <br/>
deaths. All Verant needs to say is something like &quot;Kelin&#39;s Lucid <br/>
Lullaby will be less effective beware&quot;. Damn I am getting worked up <br/>
over this and I am not hight enought level to use the song. It shows <br/>
a lack of care and little attention to detail.<br/>
<br/>
I knew about the changes before they were put in. I read them on a <br/>
message board for enchanters(my other character). There is a beta <br/>
board run by Verant which often has posts from the developers <br/>
outlining future developments. Only people from Beta stages 1,2 <br/>
and 3 are allowed to access this board. (not 100% sure about this <br/>
info).<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if some of the Bards who read the &quot;beta board&quot; <br/>
(John,Greg???) can keep us informed about future changes to <br/>
Bards, and perhaps new changes in general (not going to off topic <br/>
of course)?<br/>

&gt; I have notice this occurance as of late.  I lulled a whole bunch of Gnolls<br/>
&gt; and tried to attack one of them.  Instead of getting one or two I had the<br/>
&gt; whole group of four chasing me.  Is it a bug or a game balance change?<br/>
