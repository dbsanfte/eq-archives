<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445898181">EQ&#39;s official verdict on that is that it isnt a bug.. thats what is supposed<br/>
to happen. I dropped a pack that had a SBS and a PG Tommie.. imagine how<br/>
happy I was considering how often the stupid guy with the tommie spawns.. I<br/>
petitioned and was told to contact verant directly and was given an email<br/>
address. I emailed him and he said I am sorry about your loss there is<br/>
nothing we will do that is how it is supposed to happen.. Let me tell you<br/>
how happy I was..<br/>

&gt; &gt; Man that bites considering all the switching we do between weapons and<br/>
&gt; &gt; instruments. Well I have dropped Lore like Tomahawks and Claw on the<br/>
floor<br/>
&gt; &gt; and its always been there to pickup. Its a good thing Verant is so quick<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; replace bug-lost items. My best friend a 47th Monk zoned into Sol B 2<br/>
weeks<br/>
&gt; &gt; ago and arrived totally nekkid, Verant still hasnt replaced his stuff<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; &gt; though they have promised a complete restore of his charactor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Damn is that bug still around? That happened to a friend of mine the<br/>
&gt; week they advertised Sol B open and populated.<br/>
