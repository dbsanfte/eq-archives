<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506583941"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Here is the part I think he is referring to.  I would interpret it somewhat<br/>
&gt; differently.   I dont read &quot;never&quot; in here - just that it will take a lot<br/>
&gt; longer in real time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is, of course, how it should be.  As a casual gamer playing 2 hours a<br/>
night, I should expect to advance slower than somebody who plays 12 hours a<br/>
day.  There&#39;s no &quot;bias&quot; against casual gamers in EQ that doesn&#39;t exist in any<br/>
other online game.  And it&#39;s not really accurate to call it a bias<br/>
either...after all would it be fair for me to level 6x faster than Joe<br/>
Collegestudent just because I can&#39;t play as much as him?</div>
