corpse and you try to loot a container with a no-drop item in<br/>
it, it used to be that the container would disappear.  The<br/>
container still disappears, but if you stop looting and loot<br/>
again, it will be back.  Seems they fixed that bug, though in<br/>
a clumsy way.<br/>

open the instrument bag without switching to inventory mode,<br/>
which defeats the whole purpose of hotkeying inventory slots.<br/>
