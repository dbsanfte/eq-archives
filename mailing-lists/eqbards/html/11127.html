&gt; Not to defend them - but don&#39;t forget they have to recoup their initial<br/>
&gt; expenses.  Does anyone know how long the game was in development?  Also -<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t forget hardware costs.  So yes - it&#39;s possible they have just (or not<br/>
&gt; quite yet) turned a profit.<br/>

There was an article somewhere about revenue from traditional<br/>
games vs. online games.  Adding up the unit sales and monthly<br/>
charges thus far, EQ has taken in gross revenues on par with<br/>
Diablo.  Granted online CRPGs do have higher overhead<br/>
(servers) and recurring costs (continued development), but by<br/>
now I think it&#39;s obvious that these games with sales of only a<br/>
couple 100k easily have the potential to outgross traditional<br/>
games with sales in the millions.  (The all-time revenue champ<br/>
btw is Civilization.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as a small company - they are going to need some major venture<br/>

&gt; sign up and expect flawless play and the companies are overwhelmed with<br/>
&gt; bandwidth needs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  But I still think a small company will be the first to<br/>
get this right - the current companies seem to be suffering<br/>
from too much micromanagement by their parent companies who<br/>
think these are going to be like traditional games - develop<br/>
the product, sell it, and forget it.  The future of this genre<br/>
I believe is going to be more content-oriented (e.g. like a TV<br/>
network) than product-oriented (e.g. a TV manufacturer).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On the other hand - perhaps part of the problem is a company like Sony<br/>
&gt; expecting Console-game type profit margins.  That point will be moot in the<br/>
&gt; near future as consoles have Internet access - and they vast majority of<br/>
&gt; gamers will be console users (think about that!)  I read on a webpage<br/>
&gt; somewhere the prediction that console Internet users will surpass PC<br/>
&gt; Internet users in the year 2002.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot is going to change in the next 5-10 years.  The line<br/>
between several types of consumer electronics is going to<br/>
blur.  On the one hand, I disagree that console-game units<br/>
will surpass PCs on the Internet.  On the other, I agree that<br/>
there will be a console-type PC-HDTV thing-a-ma-jig that will<br/>
for most people replace consoles and PCs for Internet access<br/>
and gaming.  We&#39;re already beginning to see digital cameras<br/>
that can record short video clips, and digital camcorders that<br/>
can take still pictures.  Some people are working at making<br/>
TVs digital, while other people are trying to figure out how<br/>
to pipe digital video to your PC over the Internet.  These<br/>
things are eventually going to converge.  IMHO :)<br/>
