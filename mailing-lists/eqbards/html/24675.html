&gt;My guild recently allied with 2 others to have a sizeable raiding force, and<br/>
&gt;have come up with a point-based system that seems to work pretty well (it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;new so there may be kinks)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Everyone starts out at 20pts.  This is the base minimum you can have, and<br/>
&gt;therefore roll to  (ie: /random 1 20)<br/>
&gt;For your first raid, you get 30 points (this is to help folks who may not<br/>
&gt;belong to any of the 3 guilds, yet are along to help)<br/>
&gt;If you stay for a whole raid, you get 30 points (shorter raids get smaller<br/>
&gt;points)<br/>
&gt;If you stay for 2 hours to about halfway, you get half points<br/>
&gt;If you pass on a roll for your class (that isn&#39;t junk) you get an extra 5 or<br/>
&gt;10 (can&#39;t remember which) points per pass (this helps folks who are only<br/>
&gt;after one or two items)<br/>
&gt;Winning something knocks off 10 points (although I would like to see it<br/>
&gt;dropped to base 20), and you are not allowed to roll again until everyone in<br/>
&gt;that class has won something (unless it&#39;s an uber item).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of the main reasons for this was fairness.  We wanted to be able to<br/>
&gt;reward folks for coming on raids they wouldn&#39;t normally go on (Clerics in<br/>
&gt;Fear) without over-penalizing folks who can&#39;t make it due to RL.  We also<br/>
&gt;wanted to set up a heirarchy so that folks who only needed a few items would<br/>
&gt;have a better shot, without using level as a point-modifier (therefore<br/>
&gt;encouraging p-leveling just so you can be the highest level and get a better<br/>
&gt;chance at something).  This gives EVERYONE a shot at an item, the more<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ve won, the less of a shot youhave.  The more you&#39;ve gone on and the<br/>
&gt;more loot you&#39;ve passed on, the better a shot you have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have also broken loot into 3 gropups:<br/>
&gt;trash (ie: Imbrued bracers)<br/>
&gt;Common (legs, arms, bps, etc)<br/>
&gt;rares (rare and god drops)<br/>
&gt;Trash loses no points for being looted, and gains no points for passing<br/>
&gt;(trash is determined by a class beforehand)<br/>
&gt;The rares and god drops will most likely be NBG or straight /random if more<br/>
&gt;than 1 is deemed in need<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there a maximum to one&#39;s roll? ie. If you have, let&#39;s say 1000 points <br/>
built up, you get to roll from 1-1000?<br/>
