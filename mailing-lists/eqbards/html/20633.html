it&#39;s been tested numerous times.  Especially on Rallos (where I happen to<br/>
have a bard).<br/>

The dot does not stack with itself.  What you may have been seeing with 2<br/>
bards is 3 things:<br/>
<br/>
1)  fewer interrupts thus the effects were staying up more steadily, thus<br/>
doing more dmg<br/>
2)  Two bards singing over-lapping songs, thus effects are staying up, thus<br/>
doing more dmg<br/>
3)  Punching dmg IS significant espeically once you hit your 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s<br/>
(up to 10dmg/punch)<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, you were dropping the npc&#39;s faster, spreading the npc&#39;s dmg out<br/>
among 3 instead of 2, and your dmg was steadier thus, overall, you did<br/>
slightly more dmg with 2 than one bard.  You took (effectively) less dmg<br/>
because you had 3 people sharing it while playing healing with a lute, thus<br/>
mitigating what dmg there was more effectively.<br/>
<br/>
But, no, bard dot&#39;s do not stack with themselves.  Different bard dots stack<br/>
but not two bards sining the same DoT.<br/>

&gt; &gt; No, Just like any other spell/song you cannot place two<br/>
&gt; &gt; instances of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same song on a creature.  Same as for healing you cannot<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;stack&#39; healing<br/>
&gt; &gt; with itself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Basically any song/affect with a &quot;duration&quot; cannot be stacked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This makes sense of course, but I am still left explaining what appened in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; 2 bard 1 cleric group (all 34) at the giant fort in the Frontier<br/>
mountains.<br/>
&gt; With only 3 it very much seemed like you could easily see the effect of<br/>
&gt; different strategies when fighting tumps.The cleric was only healing, the<br/>
&gt; other bard was a fellow I know and who said the effects didn&#39;t stack, I<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; I thought they did, so as an experiment he switched from Melee to all<br/>
&gt; instrument.<br/>
&gt; We were taking about the same damage and the cleric was finishing with the<br/>
&gt; same mana. The cleric reported that the health was indeed dropping faster<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the tump,  both us bards being a little too busy to really judge. We<br/>
fought<br/>
&gt; for about an hour this way, and if one of us was doing no more than<br/>
punching<br/>
&gt; damage (and allowing fewer knocks out of songs) that means that one of us<br/>
&gt; was superfluous, but I am certain a group of one bard and a cleric would<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; do nearly as well.<br/>
&gt; I understand this is not a very scientific study, at all, but it seemed<br/>
&gt; pretty convincing at the time. Has anyone actually methodically checked<br/>
it?<br/>
&gt; I am happy to be wrong, but I would be happier being wrong with a good<br/>
&gt; explanation for what happened :o)<br/>
