<div id="ygrps-yiv-731370119">I was fighting at the giant wizzy spires last night and I was getting <br/>
faction messages on a regular basis...even when we weren&#39;t fighting <br/>
anything.  Down with Mayong and his residents.  Pretty funny actually.  I <br/>
guess this is a known bug.  We chalked it up to roleplaying...we decided we <br/>
must have been fighting on the graves of some Mayong residents.<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s what I was finding, too.  If I got anywhere near a Drachnid without<br/>
&gt;it actually aggro&#39;ing on me or me taking a swipe at it, sooner or later I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;get a bad faction message.  Mayong really loves me now. ;)<br/>

&gt;---------------------------<br/>
&gt;We were getting them near the Sarnak fortress in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
&gt;We petitioned, and the guide said if a sarnak even looked at you, you<br/>
&gt;got on its aggro list -- and thus got faction hits<br/>
