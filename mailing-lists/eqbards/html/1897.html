<div id="ygrps-yiv-637744606">That&#39;s interesting. I don&#39;t know who anyone actually is, or whether someone that<br/>
says they are a musician truely is, for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noted however that John Kim has an exceptional understanding of game<br/>
mechaincs and does alot of testing and what not, always backing up his<br/>
statements with viable data. His detailed explanation sounds very logical to me,<br/>
so if there is to be another side of the argument, I would like to see it<br/>
supported by something more than &quot;I say I work for Verant&quot;. No offense intended<br/>
to J.M. or any other posters btw, I just like to know WHY something works, and<br/>
not merely that it does or doesn&#39;t work.<br/>

&gt; will go with his explanation over yours. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
