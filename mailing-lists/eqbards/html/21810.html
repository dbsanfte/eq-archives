<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070865885">Working as Intended is a valid response.  My problem is that with Verant it<br/>
has been the only response for bards. (Ok a generalization, but still true<br/>
on all important issues)<br/>
<br/>
Working as Intended just shouldn&#39;t be the answer all the time unless there<br/>
is no real consideration being given to our issues.  Regardless of Verant&#39;s<br/>
brilliance it is highly unlikely we are wrong all the time.<br/>

At 01:44 PM 10/11/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>

&gt;real answer other than &quot;we&#39;ll look into it at some point&quot; and &quot;working as<br/>
&gt;intended&quot;.  I know if I ever saw real progress on these issues I&#39;d be the<br/>
&gt;first to say wtg!  Anyone who is familiar with my opinions on trade skills<br/>
&gt;would know that.  IMHO Yak is the best thing to happen to Verant since<br/>

 </span></blockquote>why isn&#39;t working as intended a valid response?  that&#39;s like going to an<br/>
amusement park, riding a roller coaster and saying, well my idea of a roller<br/>
coaster is different, it should have 2 more corkscrews and a loop and<br/>
expecting<br/>
the amusement park to reconstruct it to match your specifications.  if you<br/>
don&#39;t like it, ride another ride (try another class) or if you really don&#39;t<br/>
like it, <br/>
don&#39;t go to the park anymore (cancel your account).  but either way, it&#39;s a<br/>
waste<br/>
of time and energy to keep ranting about it afterwards.<br/>
