<div id="ygrps-yiv-121890841">Until you play a bard for a while, and determine if you like the class, I<br/>
would not invest a whole lot of plat in equipment.  The bard class is unlike<br/>
all the others and some people just don&#39;t like doing what it takes to play<br/>
the bard (lots and lots of starting and stopping songs via hot keys or<br/>
such.)  But you can pretty easily find out by playing one for a few levels<br/>
or 10 ;)<br/>
<br/>
I would start with 20pp and go buy all leather - fast and easy to get from<br/>
the npc merchant.  Then spend another 20-40pp and buy a dragoon dirk (or go<br/>
kill Dvinn and get a free one.)  Also, go to the nearest rogue guild (if you<br/>
can find it) and buy a parrying dagger.  It looks like a dagger when<br/>
equipped in secondary slot but all it does is add ac like a shield.  Or buy<br/>
a chitin shield - not only do they look nice buy they have some useful<br/>
resists (poison) for low level mobs you will encounter.  I would buy *a lot*<br/>
of bandages and some SoW potions too (forget about damage shield potions -<br/>
the ds they cast depends on the level of the caster and for low levels they<br/>
are &#39;not worth it.&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
You should read one of the bard web sites and print a chart of when you get<br/>
skills.  Buy a hand drum (or MM drum if you wanna spend 500pp) and a<br/>
mandolin (lighter weight than a lute otherwise the same - do not buy a &quot;Lute<br/>
of the Gyspy Princess&quot; - it&#39;s a non-used item for a quest that changed long<br/>
ago and has no special power for bards.) Get a mino horn from minos in<br/>
Steamfont or Beholder and a brass horn from npc merchant.  Drum and lute are<br/>
what you use first - wind (mino or flute) and brass come a bit later on.<br/>
<br/>
Banded Armor is just fine if you wanna spend the plat.  Blackened Iron looks<br/>
cool but weighs a lot. Bronze also weighs a lot for small increase in AC.<br/>
Not sure where Rygor fits into the current equation - it might be an option<br/>
but more expensive.  <br/>
<br/>
Once you discover how you feel about barding (endless clicking of hot keys<br/>
and frequent looting of your own corpse), you will know whether you want to<br/>
get a set of Lambent Armor (bard&#39;s class quest armor  - but with the low<br/>
number of bards and frequent drops of Singing Steel armor - you may well be<br/>
able to get a couple nice Singing Steel pieces very cheaply) which has nice<br/>
stats for mid level bards or whether you want the address to the Safe House<br/>
and someone to hold your stuff for a couple minutes.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Items for a newb?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a level 29 druid and i am gonna buy some stuff for my bard and i was<br/>
wondering what kind of stuff should i get<br/>
    I think i was a 1 hs and a peircing weapon but not sure<br/>
    Also i might buy banded armor<br/>
    What is a good BP for me to get<br/>
    And is there any class specific armor that i should buy?<br/>
Thanks for helping me out...<br/>
