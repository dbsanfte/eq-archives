<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101004589">Well,<br/>
I&#39;m probably the weakest dressed level 27 bard on the<br/>
Tunare server.  I have level 1 people asking why I<br/>
don&#39;t have bronze--and they are wearing bronze! argh! <br/>
Actually, I just don&#39;t care for the look.  But here&#39;s<br/>
my list.  Don&#39;t laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Head: Black Iron Crown<br/>
Face: Silver Star Ruby Veil<br/>
Ears: Opalline earring and Onyx earring<br/>
Neck: Electrum Black Pearl Choker<br/>
Shoulders: Bloodstained Mantle<br/>
Chest: Reserve Militia Tunic (i have banded as well<br/>
but like the look of the militia tunic even though the<br/>
stats aren&#39;t great)<br/>
Arms: Barbed Arms<br/>
Wrist 1: Bracer of Erollisi (unless I just sold it)<br/>
Wrist 2: Banded Bracer<br/>
Hands: Lambent Gauntlets (elf hide in bank)<br/>
Rings: Dervish Rings  (OK, stop laughing--haven&#39;t<br/>
found a jeweler that could make me the ones I want<br/>
Back: Banded Cloak <br/>
Waist: Purity Belt<br/>
Legs: Barbed Legs<br/>
Feet: Banded Boots  (the random loot for the kobold<br/>
hide hasn&#39;t hit for me yet!)<br/>
 <br/>
Weapons: Obsidian Scimitar, dragoon dirk.  Also have a<br/>
barbed leather whip and am working on getting that<br/>
obsidian shard<br/>
<br/>
Have about 300 plat in bank.  So there you have it. <br/>
An untwinked bard who has been un-obsessed with<br/>
getting items.  Now, I&#39;m working on it a bit<br/>
more--sick of helping people camp for THEIR stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Signed,<br/>
Thex Luteslinger (the bard who refuses to wear bronze<br/>
just cause I should)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wow, looks like I need to go shopping!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll post this, perhaps somewhere some level 1 bard<br/>
&gt; will think I&#39;m the man<br/>
&gt; hehe!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Head: Bronze Helm<br/>
&gt; Face: Leering Mask<br/>
&gt; Ears: Golden Amber Earrings X2<br/>
&gt; Neck: Spiked Collar<br/>
&gt; Shoulders: Bloodstained Mantle<br/>
&gt; Arms: Bronze Vambraces<br/>
&gt; Wrist 1: Bracer of Erollisi<br/>
&gt; Wrist 2: Bronze Bracer<br/>
&gt; Hands: Lambent Gauntlets (I still keep my elf-hide<br/>
&gt; in reserve though)<br/>
&gt; Rings: Jagged Band, Can&#39;t remember the other, some<br/>
&gt; wedding band or something<br/>
&gt; +2 STR maybe?<br/>
&gt; Back: Banded Cloak (Hehe)<br/>
&gt; Waist: Drakescale Belt<br/>
&gt; Legs: Lambent Greaves<br/>
&gt; Feet: Kobold Hide Boots<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Weapons: Obsidian Scimitar X2, Dragoon Dirk, and my<br/>
&gt; newly dusted off<br/>
&gt; Obsidian Shard - thanks for the info by the way, who<br/>
&gt; knew? A fire proc<br/>
&gt; resisted by fire goblins? Sometimes I truly think<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m the slowest bard in<br/>
&gt; Norrath.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Instruments: Hand drum, lute, wodden flute, brass<br/>
&gt; horn.  I live dangerously!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Money?  Not a clue, not very much anymore after<br/>
&gt; buying my lambent jewels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So there, I&#39;ll have you all know that I think the<br/>
&gt; half smurf-half carrot<br/>
&gt; look is going to be very in this season!  At least<br/>
&gt; you guys give us all<br/>
&gt; something of a wish list to shoot for!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Weiland<br/>
&gt; &lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>
&gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Elwyn - If you feel inclined, throw your list up<br/>
&gt; here.  I&#39;m curious, but<br/>
&gt; still too timid in game to ask to inspect hehe.  See<br/>
&gt; you round!<br/>
