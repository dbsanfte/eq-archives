<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278635393">At one time, the Order of Thunder was tradeable.  I completed that <br/>
quest a looooong time ago and sold the Order of Thunder to an <br/>
enchanter.  Then they changed it to a NO DROP.<br/>

&gt; &gt;A Troll warrior gave me one of these in WK several<br/>
&gt; &gt;weeks ago.  I was maybe lvl 15 at the time and really<br/>
&gt; &gt;happy to get it.  He said he looted it and didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; &gt;it.  I didn&#39;t ask at the time.  Wish I had now. </span></blockquote></div>
