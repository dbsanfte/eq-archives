<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692534203">I have 2 not so directly bard related questions that maybe someone on this<br/>
list can help me with so I don&#39;t have to mingle on the Vault boards and soil<br/>
my hands.<br/>
<br/>
1.  What is the new &quot;Clip Plane&quot; option and what does it do?  Whey do new<br/>
&quot;features&quot; get added to the game with no explanation (2nd part of question<br/>
is rhetorical)<br/>
<br/>
2.  What did the patch message mean by &quot;you can now see your current and<br/>
maximum skill points&quot; because from how I understood the question and what I<br/>
saw, there is nothing new at all about what is displayed on the skills<br/>
screen.<br/>
