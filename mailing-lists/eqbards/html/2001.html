<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780968436">So what does this all have to do with being a Bard?  So far I have<br/>
received about 40 messages from this list and maybe five of them were<br/>
relevant.  If we keep mail-bombing the high level bards with this crap<br/>
they are not going to want to stay subscribed.  Those are the guys that<br/>
can answer the most questions...<br/>

&gt; Not braggadocio, just curious as to the earlier complaints of paying more<br/>
&gt; than 20pp for a really good weapon.  And frankly, killing orcs for that long<br/>
&gt; is way boring and little or no xp at 12th level.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Your group only rakes in 20pp in 2 hrs?  Or is that 20pp each in those 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;hrs?  If so then aren&#39;t you spending 20pp each to go get it at 60+ pp?  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;not, what are you hunting?  I can make 20pp in 4 hours by myself hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt;orcs, with 2 could easily do it in 2hrs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; er, I believe it would be appropriate to include a discussion of level here.<br/>
&gt; It of course looks like<br/>
&gt; wanton and inane braggadocio to this 11th level bard *laughs* as would my<br/>
&gt; claim of about 3-4 plat<br/>
&gt; per hour soloing in Blackburrow (NOT that I think that is great, it&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt; competition I have any<br/>
&gt; need to enter not being a powergamer type) to a 1st  level bard.<br/>
