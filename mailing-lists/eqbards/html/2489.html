 </span></blockquote>I would suggest that J.M. knows the answer, but I would bet my<br/>
bard&#39;s life that he isn&#39;t going to post a formula.  Firstly he<br/>
likely wouldn&#39;t want to, and secondly it may be against a<br/>
confidentiality clause in his contract.  ;)<br/>
Besides, it would ruin all the fun we have of throwing ideas<br/>
back and forth. ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The following formula would be true according to my above examples:<br/>
&gt; Weapon dmg * 2 + skill lvl/strength bonuses. Every couple levels, as my<br/>
&gt; skills increase, my max dmg goes up as well.<br/>
&gt; So, with my current skill levels and strength factors, it would be<br/>
&gt; Weapon dmg * 2 + 9<br/>
&gt; Barbed whip - 7 * 2 + 9 = 23<br/>
&gt; Silvery axe, dirk, ashenwood spear - 6 * 2 + 9 = 21<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You haven&#39;t stated your &#39;skill lvl/strength bonuses&#39;.  Personally<br/>
I HATE magic numbers (I&#39;m a programmer), so throwing in a &#39;9&#39; is<br/>
unsatisfactory without explanation, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now here&#39;s where I became confused and threw a wrench into my whole<br/>
&gt; formula.<br/>
&gt; I equipped a new weapon, which has a dmg of 11.<br/>
&gt; But, so far (haven&#39;t had oppurtunity to test it a whole lot), its max<br/>
&gt; dmg peaked at 35<br/>
&gt; Certain weapon - 11 * 2 + 9 = 31. So how was I hitting for 35?<br/>
&gt; Obviously my formula is not correct.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously.  Firstly you didn&#39;t say what skill that weapon used,<br/>
so i can&#39;t check my own formula.  But assuming it is a 1H or<br/>
piercing weapon, my formula gives max damage of 34.  Pretty close,<br/>
if not correct.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have a problem with a dmg * (something) + something else.<br/>
Personally the idea of dmg * (something + something else) is more<br/>
appealing to me, as it gives greater return as &#39;something&#39; and<br/>
&#39;something else&#39; (say STR and skill) increase.<br/>
<br/>
The inconsistent results you recieved also suggest that whatever<br/>
formula you used to get your magic number &#39;9&#39; is wrong.  Did you<br/>
actually use a formula, or did you just say &quot;dmg * 2 - max = 9, <br/>
so the modifier must be + 9&quot;?<br/>
The fact that it doesn&#39;t work suggests that the modifier is not<br/>
just a linear addend.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, what is the correct formula? I haven&#39;t a clue anymore. I sure would<br/>
&gt; like to know though. Knowledge is power afterall =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As posted earlier by myself, i believe the formula is something like:<br/>
<br/>
dmg * max( (skill in weapon + STR)/100 , 2) + 1<br/>
<br/>
However, circumstantial evidence posted in this newsgroup suggests<br/>
that this is not all there is to it.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have difficulty believing that the Offence skill has<br/>
no bearing on how much you hit.  OK, maybe it&#39;s used for the chance<br/>
to hit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else got any thoughts?<br/>
