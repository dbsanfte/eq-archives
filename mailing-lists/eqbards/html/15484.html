<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877972942">Screw ALL those places.  The place to get through 30<br/>
(and a bunch more levels after that) is the entrance<br/>
of Kedge Keep.  Get yourself a group of 3 players of<br/>
30 or ABOVE.  Pull the lancer swordfish.  You have to<br/>
be careful how your pull them.  There is generally an<br/>
impaler or piercer nearby so you have to make sure you<br/>
don&#39;t attack the lancers at those times.  Kind of<br/>
approach the area and let the lancer attack you. <br/>
Anyway, the experience is AWESOME!  There is never<br/>
anyone there (except for the occasional raids on Phin<br/>
or whatever his name is).  The loot is absolutely god<br/>
awful though.  However, I guarantee you will level<br/>
very quickly.  The zone is right there so you should<br/>
never die.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this question has been answered a thousand<br/>
&gt; times, but where would people suggest to move<br/>
&gt; through level 30.  I went to High Keep to get 30,<br/>
&gt; but the lines are ridiculous and unlike the other<br/>
&gt; waiting list areas, xp is the only thing there.  Any<br/>
&gt; suggestions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance, <br/>
