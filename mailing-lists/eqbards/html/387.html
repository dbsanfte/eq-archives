<div id="ygrps-yiv-990280806">Sorry if this has been addressed... I&#39;m finding level 9 to be excruciatingly<br/>
slow going...  Any pointers?  I spent a huge amount of time tonight with a<br/>
large group at east commons orc camp.  They want me to use the Discord<br/>
song - so all the orcs jump me.  I get killed instantly.  The rest proceed<br/>
to wipe out the rest as I memorize and work my way back.  Before I get<br/>
there - they all decide it&#39;s late and log off.  Not a one bothered to wait<br/>
and offer me a share of silver or loot...  Wasted about an hour and ended up<br/>
with LESS XP than I started..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m under the impression now - I&#39;m better off pairing off with someone at<br/>
this point than trying large groups...  Large seem to take forever to do<br/>
anyting - and I&#39;m not getting much xp or loot..<br/>
