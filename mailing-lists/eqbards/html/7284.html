<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770667219"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Perhaps it has to do with whether Accelerando is currently up at the &gt;time.<br/>
&gt;Maybe if you have it up when you get rooted, you can&#39;t break it with<br/>
&gt;accel,<br/>
&gt;but if you aren&#39;t singing it when you&#39;re rooted, it will break it.  &gt;It<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be too far fetched considering the weirdness involved with &gt;these<br/>
&gt;interactions we&#39;ve seen in the past.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Along this train of thought... All of the times that I &#39;appeared&#39; to break<br/>
root with Selos, I had not been playing Selos before they rooted me.  Also<br/>
for the record.  At 21st level, all of rooters were blue...<br/>
