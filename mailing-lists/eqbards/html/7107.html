Sorry you think this topic was a troll. It was my first post to the list and I<br/>
thought I had a legitimate issue and was very happy to read the varied opinions<br/>
from the list members. Some of the opinions and play styles differ from mine.<br/>
That&#39;s cool. I can understand their motivations and now I am better for it.<br/>
Maybe my future party members may be better for it as well. That doesn&#39;t sound<br/>
much like a troll to me.<br/>

Hey! Don&#39;t do that!  I started this thread, but I&#39;m not the guy that said troll<br/>
(tho I believe he was just making a joke).  This has been a great discussion,<br/>
and without you it would have been much less fun.<br/>
<br/>
You are willing to reason, and never resort to cheap shots.  And as a huge<br/>
bonus, you can admit when you may have made an error!  Wow, talk about a bonus<br/>
on any discussion list.<br/>
