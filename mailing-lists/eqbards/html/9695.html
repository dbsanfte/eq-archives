<div id="ygrps-yiv-151837359">I got lambert greves at 23.  Use your invise song and hit guk and perma to<br/>
get shin and icy greves respectively  if you spend some time  ~ 2 hour in<br/>
both dungons for me you can reqest looting rights for the armor. As it is<br/>
lore and heavy it is bad loot to most of the casters hunting there and thay<br/>
willing let you loot and watch your back. Good luck to you you will need 110<br/>
pp to by gems to do quest.  Maybe another 100 pp if you buy your lambert.<br/>
Lambert stones are acutiong around 100 pp ( i will not pay that im to<br/>
cheep )<br/>

&gt;    Call me indecisive - but money accumulates in my bank - cause I can<br/>

not too thrilled with my armor.  Mostly some banded still a lot of barbed,<br/>
etc.  A few pieces of bronze.  I&#39;m at level 26 btw - so I&#39;m almost at the<br/>
point where I can think about questing for Lambent.<br/>

equivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.  Question<br/>
is - is it worth it?  How important is one or two AC points?  How important<br/>
is 2 or 3 but giving up STR or whatever bonuses.  I have Blackened Iron<br/>
Shoulders.  It says &quot;Magic Item&quot;.  What does this actually provide?  Is the<br/>
Steel Pauldron the equivalent?  Pretty annoying you can&#39;t tell without<br/>
buying and then you can sell it at a fraction of what you pay for it if you<br/>
make a mistake (obviously forcing you to check website like EQualizer...<br/>
