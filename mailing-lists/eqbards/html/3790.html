My introduction to roleplaying was when someone gave me a Dungeons &<br/>
Dragons basic set at the age of about 30.  I ran the module that came in it<br/>
for my wife and kids and some of our married friends.<br/>

When there was all the flap about D&D and Satan worship, I was one of the<br/>
involve, experienced, grown-up voices saying, &quot;Hogwash.&quot;<br/>
