<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890905533">Well, here&#39;s the answer...Yes other classes especially KS&#39;ing casters and<br/>
Kiting Druids will want them.  Bet the warrior&#39;s are now laughing.<br/>
<br/>
Darkwood Staff:  Romar Sunto will  give you a darkwook staff, also known as<br/>
the Staff of Ro, which is useable by all classes, if you bring him a Lambent<br/>
Stone from a Hill Giant, a Sand Giant or a Griffin. <br/>

Having read the spoilers about the new bard quests on the test server, I&#39;m<br/>
wondering if we will have to compete with other classes for the components<br/>
to complete these quests?  For example, we need lambent stones for each of<br/>
the armor pieces.  Will other classes also need lambent stones for their<br/>
armor quests or are the components they need completely different than ours?<br/>
The same question applies to the special loot items we need.  I hope that<br/>
each class has their own unique components required for their quest.  You<br/>
would assume that if lambent armor is bard only then only bards have a need<br/>
for lambent stones.  However, everyone knows that you can&#39;t assume anything<br/>
when it comes to EQ.  Can anyone provide confirmation on this?<br/>
