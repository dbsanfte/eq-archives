<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717287673">Yes, it is an area effect. This means you can only use it to &quot;stun&quot; in a<br/>
safe battle, where you have one or two monsters and no real chance of<br/>
strracting others. Which brings up an interesting point.<br/>
<br/>
I do way better in outdoor zones, because in a dungeon not only can I not<br/>
run, but I am afraid to use my really cool area effect songs (The Level 15<br/>
Lullaby, The Level 20 Weakening Song, to name a few).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone used these kind of songs in a dungeon, and if so what was the<br/>
result? Killing your group? I know it can only effect 4 creatures . . .<br/>
this can be an advantage, right? At most you piss off three things other<br/>
than the one you&#39;re attacking, right?<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;that causes a stun - nothing else, just a stun.  Kind of a &quot;Bash&quot; for<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bards.  Comments?<br/>

&gt;&gt;The Level 15 Song (Lullaby) works just like a stun when used in mele<br/>
&gt;&gt;combat. It doesn&#39;t start working wel until well after Level 15, but once it<br/>
&gt;&gt;starts working, it is very nice.<br/>

&gt;Ahh - this I did not know.  But correct me if I am wrong, but isn&#39;t that an<br/>
&gt;area-effect?  I was thinking of a single-target.  Something to throw in<br/>
&gt;lower (maybe to replace the level 11 or something). </span></blockquote></div>
