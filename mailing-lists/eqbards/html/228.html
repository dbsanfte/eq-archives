<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137979498">Hey all this is Pendar again and I was just wondering if any of the higher level bards would be so kind and post the name and what the songs do say after 10th level or so.. to maybe about 20th if anyone could.  I have been to websites that tell the names of them and where to get them but they dont tell what they do and I was just wondering before I bought them.  Or if you could direct me to a website that might have all this information I would appreciate you help<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
