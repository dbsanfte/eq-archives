<br/>
In an open area with few wondering mobs, AOE songs<br/>
rock.  Two mobs get pulled?  All the better because<br/>
you now are doing double damage (minus punching)<br/>
<br/>
In a dungeon seeting with mobs in rooms all around as<br/>
well as above and below, you could pull some truely<br/>
amazing trains.<br/>
<br/>
Also consider that several fighters in the group being<br/>
sped up with anthem while you twist in largos and slow<br/>
mobs down...and maybe twist in psalm or hymm may be<br/>
more effective than you using AOE songs.<br/>
<br/>
I try to look at the group each time I play and find<br/>
songs to compliment what&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
Playing a druid is pretty easy.  Damage shield, snare,<br/>
dot, dd.  rinse repeat and heal when it&#39;s needed. <br/>
Playing a bard you can taylor your performance to the<br/>
audience...<br/>
