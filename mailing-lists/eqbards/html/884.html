<div id="ygrps-yiv-338843708">This is an idea that occurred to me in the time when all I can do is<br/>
THINK about EQ. Perhaps the bards magical songs are short. Perhaps the<br/>
magic is a short spell set to music. Each tick then, is one singing of<br/>
the spell. If you sing for multiple ticks, you sing the spell multiple<br/>
times. Twisting then is singing one spell, and then another, and back.<br/>
<br/>
Though a bard is an entertainer and a storyteller, is it not right to<br/>
say that the songs with magical effects are not meant for<br/>
entertainment?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it would sound pretty to sing one song then another, but<br/>
this explanation felt better to me than to think that I am singing two<br/>
songs at the same time.<br/>

I am also a RL musician, and i don&#39;t think that anyone, no matter what<br/>
you try to say on here, sings one verse of one song, then one verse of<br/>
another song, then the second verse of the first song, then the second<br/>
verse of the second song, etc.  if you do then you are annoying the<br/>
hell out of everybody.  this is what i mean when i say that a bard<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it.  a bard is proud of his singing and wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
appear foolish even if it did boost his stats.  this is all IMHO by the<br/>
way.  everyone is free to their own opinion.<br/>
