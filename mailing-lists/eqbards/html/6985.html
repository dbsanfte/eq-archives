Sylly I think you are on to something.  Even if this replaces one of the<br/>
really high level missing songs.  It would be like you drank 20 honey meads.<br/>
With tunnel vision and all... quite a risk, but worth it.  I really love<br/>
trade offs.<br/>

I say - forget binds - bind in a bank - close to ur spares.  Bards really<br/>
NEED a song like:<br/>
<br/>
Ramundo&#39;s Recitement of Revival  Skill: singing Target: self  Mana: 100%<br/>
(usable only 1 per game day)  sold in Erudin  <br/>
<br/>
This is totally in keeping with the bardic image - we all die A LOT!~ And by<br/>
lev 14 have considerable practice in finding r corpses and getting r stuffs<br/>
back.  So, now its time to lighten the load some and get us start getting<br/>
used to the fact that some high 40 song will burn mana too.  Also, finally a<br/>
use for all that clarity I get casted on me.  Now this should not be a get<br/>
out of jail free card but function like the Cleric&#39;s revive/resuss - you<br/>
come back to ur corpse and are staggering all over with no str/sta/agi/dex.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. this started out as a joke but it is sounding better and better to me.<br/>

		I&#39;m interested in the binding song...and I agree that it is<br/>
unlikely to be<br/>
		approved.  However, here&#39;s my 2 cp:</div>
