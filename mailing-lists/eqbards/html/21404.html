Heh!  You&#39;re all just lucky bastages ;pp  I made the miistake of whipping<br/>
out my Tamborine and juggling the two chants whikle my two druid buddies<br/>
rooted and used their DoTs.  After that one fight, I was forbidden from<br/>
playing manasong while a battle rages :o)~  One of the tree-lickers pulls<br/>
(with a nice nuke) the other roots when the MOB gets to us, then they each<br/>
drop DoTs while I juggle chants.<br/>
Root breaks?  No biggie, they keep me buffed with SoW (shhh!) so I can run<br/>
and DOT while they re-root.<br/>
When I posted my intent to Strike. they weren&#39;t to pleased but understood.<br/>
(Note:  these are two guild-bros. that I have known since we were newbs in<br/>
NWN together, so it was really tough :o/ )<br/>
