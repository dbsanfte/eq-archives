 </span></blockquote>  The helmet ugh.  Mudwater rune, piece of cake.<br/>
<br/>
  Opoline Helm...  deepwater goblins are mostly L38 (they almost always<br/>
  give exp to L50 players).  For those of you who don&#39;t have the<br/>
  helmet, or don&#39;t know how in the world you can beat up one of these<br/>
  critters, or don&#39;t know how to pull these guys...  this is for you:<br/>
<br/>
  NOTE: I have been slain in 4 casts from a deepwater goblin.<br/>
        It took 3 casts to kill my L50 shaman friend.  Do not<br/>
        underestimate the power of these casters.  ~350 dmg per cast.<br/>
<br/>
  How to pull these puppies... (you need a druid for this)<br/>
<br/>
  First of all, don&#39;t do it in Oasis.  I had spectres roaming all<br/>
  around when I first tried to go out there and grab a few.  You<br/>
  really need to do this in Lake Rathe at the Rathe Mountains zone.<br/>
<br/>
  Secondly, you cannot cast on things under the water.  Things in<br/>
  the water can cast on you.  Here&#39;s the catch, they wont.  At least<br/>
  you hope =)<br/>
<br/>
  Four deepwater goblins can be tracked between the dock at Rathe<br/>
  Mts and that tower with the blue flame.  If you aren&#39;t L35 yet,<br/>
  get a ranger/druid to show you where his/her tracking takes them.<br/>
  You&#39;ll find it&#39;s in the middle of the water, but with full clipping<br/>
  plane you can still see the dock near Rathe Mts.<br/>
<br/>
  You cannot pull these goblins separately, its all or nothing.<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, now the fun part:<br/>
<br/>
  * Get SoW from druid.<br/>
  * Get Levitate from druid.<br/>
  * Get druid to show you where the goblins are, and you hover there<br/>
    while he returns to the zoneline.<br/>
  * Once druid&#39;s in place, start your strongest magic resist song.<br/>
    Elemental, Guardian, Mystical... whichever.<br/>
  * Now, the Z-axis is your friend here... dip into the water a<br/>
    little and start your favorite AE song.<br/>
  * Once you do this you must _get out_ of the water asap, and<br/>
    haul ass back to the zoneline for Rathe Mountains.<br/>
  * You may take residual dmg.  But most deepwaters will not <br/>
    cast underwater.  They prefer to shoot arrows at you.<br/>
  * Reach the zoneline and wait, since we are playing on the<br/>
    Z-axis here, you will instantly get attacked and see nothing.<br/>
    The goblins will be _below_ the ground plane... Move around<br/>
    a little and try to force them to move up onto your level.<br/>
  * Druid then immediately snares one deepwater, and you both<br/>
    _must_ zone.<br/>
  * As soon as you appear on the Rathe Mountains side, have druid<br/>
    quickly heal all dmg, and then rezone asap.<br/>
  * The three other goblins are now back at their spawn point,<br/>
    and one snared goblin is trying to return or is hanging around.<br/>
    Find him returning to the dock, and begin battle.  Interrupt<br/>
    him as much as you can.<br/>
<br/>
   This is the safest way to break the deepwater spawn, that I&#39;ve<br/>
   found.  Sound cheesy, maybe it kinda is.  But four deepwaters<br/>
   is suicide for any player.<br/>
 <br/>
