<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780087041">I&#39;ve been to the soerbaird site, and it&#39;s very nice looking.<br/>
You can see lots of bard tales and songs made up by people<br/>
playing as bards in eq.<br/>
<br/>
However: Please! CORRECT ME IF I&#39;M WRONG!<br/>
<br/>
Is all the actual nuts and bolts information you have<br/>
compiled about bards locked behind passworded sections<br/>
marked &quot;Members Only&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I may be an idiot and unable to find the information I am<br/>
actually interested in (specific tactics, song effects,<br/>
bard quests, bard only magic items, bard faction information)<br/>
and if so I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
But if I am correct that all such information is secreted away,<br/>
then I have heard enough about the clique known as<br/>
the soerbairds. If y&#39;all want to go have your private little<br/>
group and harvest a bunch of information which you then keep<br/>
to yourself, then I for one don&#39;t want to hear the<br/>
name of your clubby club on this list again. Any information<br/>
that I am able to unearth about the bard profession is<br/>
public knowledge as far as I&#39;m concerned and I would be happy<br/>
to have it repeated to any struggling or curious bard out there.<br/>
<br/>
If I missed a link or something, then I apologize in advance,<br/>
and long live the soerbaird :P<br/>

&gt; Hail Roop and bards!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was an excellent list indeed. I&#39;m compiling a smilar list for the<br/>
&gt; Soerbaird and love to hear what other bards have done with songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One question I pose to all you bards out there: The Charismatic Carillon--<br/>
&gt; I know a few of you have posted that you use this song, and that it has at<br/>
&gt; least a minimal affect, but I have not even seen that much. My thinking is<br/>
&gt; that the song has not yet been giving the blessing of the gods<br/>
&gt; (it is bugged).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, could some one advise me of the appropriate way to use this song? Do<br/>
&gt; I murmur it to myself, or do I serenade the shopkeeper with whom I wish to<br/>
&gt; do business? Do I initiate the trade immediately after I sing, or<br/>
&gt; do I wait<br/>
&gt; a moment? How long do I have?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would advocate that this song is more effective than it<br/>
&gt; currently is, for<br/>
&gt; at the moment it seems to be making no difference in my buying. Of course,<br/>
&gt; I am a VERY charming fellow already, and maybe I have found a limit to the<br/>
&gt; amount dashing good looks can affect purchasing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Listen and Live!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
