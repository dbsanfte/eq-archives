<div id="ygrps-yiv-716034591"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; there are many special weapons easily obtainable for<br/>
&gt; clerics like the Bloodforge hammer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, truth be told.. I found it *much* easier for<br/>
my Bard to get this weapon via the quest than for my<br/>
Cleric to get it. Play that funky music white boy on<br/>
the guy in Kaladim and he&#39;s amiable to me and let&#39;s me<br/>
do the quest without having to worry about how many<br/>
Orc&#39;s I&#39;ve killed.<br/>
<br/>
And that Cleric Only weapon that was supposedly found? I<br/>
would have to actually see it on a person to believe it.<br/>
If you look at the &quot;screen shot&quot; of it - look at how out<br/>
of focus the text is compared to the rest of the shot. It&#39;s<br/>
definitely been made up in my opinion.</div>
