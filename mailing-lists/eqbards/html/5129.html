<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653109219">I am a level 17 Bard on the Xegony Server, and I also, have not noticed any<br/>
problem (other than the Carillion) with missed notes.  My songs start up<br/>
first time, and I have no problem weaving three or so together.  I agree<br/>
that this should be reported.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I am mystified.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Mine is 95.  I suspect the difference is in our sensitivity to<br/>
&gt; &gt;this type of thing.  Some people don&#39;t mind a bit of<br/>
&gt; &gt;arcadishness in their RPGs, others do.<br/>

&gt; Hahaha!  I actually very rarely fail to start up a song.  And you assume I<br/>
&gt; like bashing keys, heheh, like I am used to an RPG that uses a Track &<br/>
Field<br/>
&gt; mentality (eh, remember that old Arcade game, the upright monster where<br/>
&gt; people would make little guys run my wambing the machine real hard?  Ah<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; sound was deafening, would echo through the entire damned mall. And,<br/>
&gt; incidently, I always sucked at that damn button breaking game!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Honestly, I am surprised by this whole discussion, for though much bothers<br/>
&gt; me in EQ generally, I have noticed no difference in failure rates,<br/>
&gt; personally.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think there is a definite BUG at work here, friends!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a level 21 Wood Elf and my modified stats are (with an instrument<br/>
&gt; wielded) 87-str, 65-sta, 102-agi, 104-dex, 80-wis, 100-chr.  Hardily<br/>
&gt; extroadinary by any means!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ran a test, which I&#39;m sure Mr. Kim would appreciate.  Just one test,<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t take too long.  I started up Accelerando one hundred times and<br/>
noted<br/>
&gt; the failure rates.  I was hoping to keep my failures noted on one hand,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; by the end I had missed a note a mere six times, yep, had to switch to my<br/>
&gt; other hand to keep track, hard with a mouse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Six missed notes in one hundred attempts to sing accelerando (I wielded a<br/>
&gt; lute just because that&#39;s what I happened to have in my hand).  As you can<br/>
&gt; see, I have no problems with missed notes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe you should all bring this to Verant&#39;s attention immedietly!!<br/>
/BUG<br/>
&gt; this!!! Because I am apparently missing a hell of a lot less notes, at a<br/>
&gt; much lower level, that the rest of you!<br/>
