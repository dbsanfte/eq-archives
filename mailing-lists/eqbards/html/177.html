with any weapon that casts a spell effect.. by the way you dont have to<br/>
zone or log to get it to stop..i find if i repeatedly click on a song<br/>
rapidly that you will get the message   you havent recovered yet   after<br/>
this you can sing songs normally....this is an annoying bug that i hope<br/>
they fix as soon as they have time<br/>

turn back to normal and I cant start a song new because the other one is<br/>
still going, nor can I stop it without haveing to log or zone. <br/>
