    I would recommend for 22 - 24 or 25 Lake Rathe , killin aviaks. loot <br/>
kinda stinks, but when you have been stuck in a lvl, loot shmute. then 25 go <br/>
to MM , stay there til 29, at 29 go to Unrest and get some nice lute in the <br/>
hag tower. Bloodstained out your ears :). at 30 i went to cazic and did 4c&#39;s <br/>
and such, occasionally loot camps, but seeing as Rubi is gone, no real loot <br/>
for you there anymore. So you may want to avoid it. Although they do have <br/>
lizzy cloaks and stuff. I&#39;m not much of a loot person anyway so i loved the <br/>
base of 4c. from 30 - 35 i stayed there. then at 35 i went to lower guk live <br/>
side got some azure sleaves and such, then went to deadside. got to 40 in guk <br/>
( sick of it by then ) then went to solb, stayed there pretty much to 50. <br/>
window is the best from 40 - 46 i would say. 46 - 50 are bats / bugs. <br/>
    ( wow , that sounded a whole lot easier than it actually was.There was a <br/>
lot of running around aimlessly and dying a ton in strange places throughout <br/>
that whole time ) hehe , although it seems like it is looking far into the <br/>
future, it sometimes helps to have an idea of where you might go next, or a <br/>
certain place to look forward to. As far as equipment to get, I have no clue. <br/>
I didn&#39;t have real jewelry til i was in my late 30&#39;s, and didn&#39;t get full <br/>
bronze til i was 25.  after that i had ruby/ bronze into my 40&#39;s until <br/>
lambent came out. <br/>
