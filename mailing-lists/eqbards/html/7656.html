&gt; With those points made, I believe that Verant gave magic-users and priests<br/>
&gt; the ability to bind anywhere because making the 2 - 3 zone run to fetch a<br/>
&gt; corpse can be darn near impossible.  Magic-users are roughly 40% less<br/>
&gt; effective in melee combat because of their reduced OFF/DEF, and priests are<br/>
&gt; down 20%, and neither group has any special melee attacks like the melee<br/>
&gt; classes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I&#39;ve heard many arguments against the melee classes being able to<br/>
bind anywhere, but this argument is silly.  This is a naked wizard vs a<br/>
blue:<br/>
<br/>
root<br/>
run<br/>
<br/>
	Casting classes have an plethora of utility spells and abilities<br/>
at their dispolsal, which a melee class does not.  Does a warrior get<br/>
invisibility?  No, but a wizard sure does.<br/>

&gt; I can tell you how hard it can be for a naked wizard to handle a tough blue<br/>
&gt; that has latched onto you when you are making the run-of-shame to your<br/>
&gt; corpse -- and this is with the best root and DD spells in the business.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>	When you don&#39;t have your corpse, your purpose isn&#39;t to solo blue<br/>
creatures.  Your purpose is to get your corpse.  And even if both classes<br/>
were many zones away, wizards have a MUCH easier time getting back.<br/>

ranger, you&#39;re slow.  And running through a zone slow, with no way to slow<br/>
or stop an creature because your hand to hand skill isn&#39;t magical, is much<br/>
more dangerous as a melee class.<br/>
	I&#39;m sorry, but playing a wizard up to the low teens just isn&#39;t<br/>
enough experience with a caster to have an accurate judge of these things,<br/>
and since your only experience with melee classes seems to be with the<br/>
bard (which is about as un-melee as you can be for a melee class), I think<br/>
your personal experience have skewed your opinion somewhat.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; With all the work that Verant has done to balance the various classes, I do<br/>
&gt; not believe that one can reasonably expect them to make this major change to<br/>
&gt; the game without a compelling need.  I believe that it is also important to<br/>
<br/>
&gt; consider the outcry Verant would get from the seven classes that can bind if<br/>
&gt; they let everyone bind.  Can&#39;t you already hear Namby Pamby the Necromancer<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Ahem, lvl 50 cleric, who honestly believes all classes should be<br/>
able to bind anywhere.  The fact that class A or class B would whine is<br/>
totally irrelevant to whether they should get bind or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My parting thought is this: sure I&#39;d love to have bind.  I&#39;d also like to be<br/>
&gt; the flying cuisinart of death, but I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m a bard.  I&#39;ve been endowed<br/>
&gt; by my creators with a wide variety of marvelous abilities (most of which<br/>
&gt; work), but bind is not one of them.  Being adaptable, I make do with what I<br/>
&gt; have, and frankly, I do pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	My argument wasn&#39;t that you should have the ability to cast bind<br/>
affinity, but that when a caster casts it on you, it would take no matter<br/>
what zone the spell was cast in.  The &quot;melee binds in city only&quot; was a<br/>
quick-fix to the complaint that being allowed to bind other people could<br/>
result in malicious binds.  To justify it it now with &quot;it&#39;s because you&#39;re<br/>
a melee class&quot; is silly.<br/>
