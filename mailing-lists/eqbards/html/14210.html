<div id="ygrps-yiv-973317864">And it&#39;s funny you should say that.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I installed the new Soundblaster Live! drivers last night and the clarity of<br/>
the sounds, as well as their 3D positionality jumped quite a bit.  One thing<br/>
that I noticed with this newfound audio clarity was that some of the sounds<br/>
seemed slightly more contrived or &quot;mechanical&quot; than they had before.<br/>
They&#39;re still quite good compared to other games I&#39;ve played, however.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Funny you should say that.  I thought the same thing when I<br/>
&gt; first heard the sound effects too (the music is pretty good<br/>
&gt; too with a wavetable soundcard).  Then last week I bought a<br/>
&gt; set of profession studio monitor headphones for a keyboard I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; buying.  Plugged it into the computer, played EQ - the sounds<br/>
&gt; were so obviously fake :) that within 5 minutes I&#39;d gone back<br/>
&gt; to the speakers (they muffle the sound enough to where the<br/>
&gt; fakeness isn&#39;t so obvious).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The sound effects are really good, but there&#39;s still a lot of<br/>
&gt; room for improvement.<br/>
