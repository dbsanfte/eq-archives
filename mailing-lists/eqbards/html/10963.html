I don&#39;t think twinking should be acceptable just because level 50 people are<br/>
bored.  They should give the level 50 people something to do then. :)<br/>
<br/>
If you adventure and get an item you can&#39;t use.. give it to someone else.<br/>
Trade it for something of an appropriate level that you CAN use.<br/>
