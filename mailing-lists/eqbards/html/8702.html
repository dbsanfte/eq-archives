<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086923747"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Unless there really is something different about the resists <br/>
&gt; of the hill giants in the Commonlands, you probably got lucky<br/>
&gt; the first time.  The high number of resists makes this a<br/>
&gt; dangerous tactic.  If you have to keep Accelerando going,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re only getting in a charm attempt every other song or so.<br/>
&gt; Obviously if you have SoW or Jboots like the original claimant<br/>
&gt; did, then it&#39;s a lot easier as you can just mash the charm<br/>
&gt; button over and over while using the mouse to stay clear.<br/>
&gt; Trying to do it with Accelerando, one slipup and you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; bashed/stunned and down two bubbles before you have a chance<br/>
&gt; to even try to restart Accelerando.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah... I usually twist Accelerando right after a charm, regardless of<br/>
whether it sticks or not.  I&#39;ve learned the hard way that you DO NOT want<br/>
that Accel to come down.  On the plus side, I didn&#39;t get hit once during the<br/>
encounter.  I suspect that you are correct in stating I got very lucky the<br/>
first time (or very unlucky the second time - who knows).  My giant fighting<br/>
isn&#39;t at an end though... : )<br/>
