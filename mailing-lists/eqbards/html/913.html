<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-9443777">Well, as I said before I haven&#39;t yet played in commercial. Now that I am <br/>
settled with moving and all and getting EQ ready, can anyone (especially <br/>
those that have played on more than one server) give me any suggestions as <br/>
to what the best servers are to play on?<br/>
<br/>
The group that I was always with in P4 is on Veeshan, and they are right <br/>
about to hit 50th level (all of them!)...and, well - they are pure <br/>
powergamers. I was wanting to join them, but there is no way I could keep up <br/>
with them. Actually, I&#39;m thinking of taking it easy. I did all the <br/>
powergaming I need during beta. I would like to seriously get into the RP <br/>
aspect of the game (or help to foster it).<br/>
<br/>
I was on Fennin Ro at that time, and that server was a nightmare. I guess <br/>
it&#39;s ok now? I heard that during beginning of commercial Fennin was even <br/>
more crowded than before. Any info on this will be much appreciated! <br/>
Especially if there are any particular servers I should stay away from. I am <br/>
thinking getting on the newest server would be ideal, though I don&#39;t know <br/>
which one is newest. Cazic?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance everyone!  =)<br/>
