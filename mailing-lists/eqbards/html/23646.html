<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354623934">Yesterday via email I got an email from some good friends (not my) guild for<br/>
a Hate raid.   We got there and it actually wasn┬Æt pre-occupied┬à Shortly<br/>
after we got there ┬û a contingent from one of the largest guilds on the<br/>
server showed up ┬û saying they had a Warrior who just needed the Maestro<br/>
Hand for his epic ┬û (Maestro WAS up) and asked to stay and only loot that ┬û<br/>
and not to participate in any other lottos.  We agreed┬à<br/>
<br/>
            We cleared all the mobs between SWC and the Maestro.  I do<br/>
believe he came unexpected at our first attempt.  Things were going pretty<br/>
good ┬û until he gravity fluxes some tanks ┬û who get stuck in the ceiling.<br/>
The Maestro proceeds to follow the tanks up and get stuck himself.<br/>
<br/>
            Clerics start to camp ┬û Maestro comes back down; a bit of<br/>
confusion follows ┬û some people are yelling at the clerics to cancel<br/>
camping ┬û others not ┬û I end up getting killed.  Not sure if we can take him<br/>
or not ┬û probably was best to keep camping; as several tanks and several<br/>
corpses are stuck.<br/>
<br/>
            Fortunately the GM/Guides were having a party (year anniversery<br/>
of a Guide) and there were so many online the /who all gm list got cut off.<br/>
I┬Æve never seen a petition answered by 2 GM┬Æs in like 15 seconds!  We get<br/>
the corpses and peoples unstuck ┬û and rezzed and setup again.<br/>
<br/>
            We had to clear several mobs ┬û but then get him when he┬Æs<br/>
ready ┬û I had my resists songs up ┬û didn┬Æt save the Chanter from Melee<br/>
damage  - but the Gravity Fluxes and Life Drains were all resisted.  We took<br/>
him down with only 2 deaths.<br/>
<br/>
            They go to loot him ┬û sadly for the Warrior ┬û no Hand; but he<br/>
had 2 count em 2 Seven String Lutes!  I was the only bard on the Raid.  I<br/>
gave Darkfox a tell ┬û and there was some talk between us of trying to get<br/>
him before it rotted but stupid me ┬û in all the zone spam I missed some Mage<br/>
asking if she could loot the lute for her ┬ôcollection┬ö.  Not clear whether<br/>
Darkfox could have gotten up in time though.<br/>
<br/>
            Anyway ┬û this is my first piece of planes gear.  This was my<br/>
fifth trip to Hate ┬û and on the first an Imbrued Bracer dropped but I lost<br/>
the lotto.  Sure would be nice to get out of my blue pants and helmet (and<br/>
upgrade my Guardian BP)┬à<br/>
