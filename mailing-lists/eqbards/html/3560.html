&gt; As someone pointed out earlier - it tends to make folks much less likely to<br/>
&gt; explore the world - course he was happy bout that - only 10 folks in his<br/>
&gt; dungeon whereas places like BB and CB are bursting at the seams.<br/>

&gt; If you really want folks to get out an explore, you don&#39;t penalize them<br/>
&gt; with half hour - hour - sometimes longer &#39;downtime&#39;, just to get back to<br/>
&gt; their corpse.<br/>

All the other zones I can think of that have this &quot;problem&quot;<br/>
are level 20+, and clerics get the first of their resurrect<br/>
line of spells at level 29.<br/>

I think the long distances add character to the game.  I&#39;ve<br/>
argued about this with a lot of friends, and there seems to be<br/>
a fundamental schizm between folks who like the hassle of<br/>
distance and folks who want the convenience of easy access.<br/>
UO went with easy access, EQ went with long distances (I hear<br/>
AC goes with even longer distances).<br/>
<br/>
What can I say - if you like the convenience of being near a<br/>
city, be prepared to put up with crowds, just like real life.<br/>
Now, making it so casters and non-casters can be bound in the<br/>
same locations, that I agree with for consistency&#39;s sake.<br/>
