That is the same old dialog from Vahlen as always.  Never saw any of the<br/>
NPC&#39;s mentioned.  If you ask about song &quot;what new composition&quot; (??) he gives<br/>
you some clues about the hermit and the winds of karana quest.  I never<br/>
found any further connections to Mistmoore.<br/>

p.s. Fabian??? anyone?  any clues? these (troll gut) lute strings are<br/>
starting to really stink up my backpack!<br/>

&gt; Mistmoore?<br/>

&gt; Metal Music:  You say, &#39;hail Vhalen Nostrolo&#39;.  Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;Nice<br/>
&gt; to meet you.  Do not the plains of Karana whistle with life.  This land is<br/>
&gt; truly blessed by the gods.  Would you like to hear a tune or do you pass?<br/>
&gt; You say, &#39;I would like to hear a tune.&#39; Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;Inside this<br/>
&gt; heart I am trapped with the sight beautiful colors, all memories of your<br/>
&gt; love They attack me with fullmight .  You left me here in this garden of<br/>
&gt; grey Never to see the true colors of the happiness of day Here in my heart<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; sit and I cry  You have left me alone and my colors have all died .  What<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; you think? Is it a happy tune or a sad tune? You say, &#39;A sad tune, I<br/>
think.&#39; </span></blockquote></div>
