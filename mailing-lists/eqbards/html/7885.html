 </span></blockquote>I have come to realize the true value of the Bracer, although at the time of<br/>
the sale I did not. I think, perhaps, that the druid used the sale as a way<br/>
to gauge my newbie-ness and sincerity. When he saw that I was truly<br/>
ignorant, but honest, he knew he could trust me to hold his fortune for him<br/>
while he switched characters.<br/>
<br/>
I like other ideas I&#39;ve seen here and elsewhere to create mini-quests for<br/>
lower-levels so you and they feel they have earned their reward. It adds<br/>
roleplay and fun to the process, and weeds out the greedy, get-rich-quick<br/>
types.<br/>
