<div id="ygrps-yiv-789925512">You could always turn it in at Rivervale for your Leatherfoot Raiders Cap, +<br/>
10 Cha, and I think AC4.  It would be a better and easier item to sell.  But<br/>
since it sounds like you are a bard, use it yourself, you can never have to<br/>
much Charisma.<br/>

P.S.  If you want to sell either one, let me know.  I am on Cazic-Thule and<br/>
would like to get the hat.<br/>

&gt; Was curious what these are going for around Norrath as I acquired one from<br/>
&gt; that little bugger Dvinn last night, and yes was actually accused of kill<br/>
&gt; stealing by a warrior???´┐¢ <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He asks for help, a dozen or so people happily dive in, 9 or 10 of them<br/>
&gt; die and only he and I survive.´┐¢ And he couldn&#39;t keep up in damage with<br/>
&gt; me?´┐¢ It was all too crazy to follow but I suspect he yelled for help, then<br/>
&gt; ducked and hid while others croaked and tried to jump in once there were<br/>
&gt; only a few people left and Dvinn was badly hurt.´┐¢ Since I was bellowing<br/>
&gt; Dvinn didn&#39;t get around to me until there were just the two of us and I<br/>
&gt; outlasted him by a bubble. Hah, my four bubbles evaporated ridding him of<br/>
&gt; his last half a bubble.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, what are these things selling for?´┐¢ I may keep it as a memento but<br/>
&gt; I really hate the way a dagger looks in your hands, a spear or scimitar is<br/>
&gt; so much more intimidating.´┐¢ It is pretty cool though.<br/>
