I am just catching up with the many emails of late.  Downtime macro I use:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 3<br/>
/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>
/cast 4<br/>
/e sings a soothing tune<br/>
<br/>
I always stopsong at the beginning of my macro since most time I already<br/>
have a song up that needs stopping.  My pause 5 is time I need to recover<br/>
consistently.<br/>
<br/>
Cast 3 is either Cantana or HOR depending on group makeup(Cantana for<br/>
heavier caster group and HOR for heavier melee).  My pause 30 is for my<br/>
timing of casting time for buff icon to come up before next song.<br/>
<br/>
Stopsong again and pause to recover.<br/>
<br/>
Cast 4 is Chorus of Clarity.  <br/>
<br/>
My emote is just let everyone I group with know what I am doing. <br/>
<br/>
I leave Clarity song going for two pulses and hit the macro again.  If I<br/>
don&#39;t pay attention or go afk for a sec, clarity continues to play = happy<br/>
casters.<br/>
<br/>
In general, I use three macros during combat.  Based on my own experience<br/>
and knowledge gained from this list, they are only 2 line macros.<br/>
<br/>
Each combat macro uses this base structure:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>
/cast x  (where x is the number of the song you want to cast).<br/>
<br/>
I label them Fight 1, Fight 2 and Fight 3.  If I need a different song, I<br/>
either edit the macro to a different song already memmed or mem in the right<br/>
song.  What does this do for you?  I only have to hit three keys to twist<br/>
instead of six(don&#39;t have to stop a song anymore).  I only use 2 line macros<br/>
in case there is a problem and I need to do something else.  Macros can&#39;t be<br/>
stopped(that I know of) so long macros can cause a problem.  (ie, you just<br/>
started a long macro, then big bad mob spawns on cleric, you want to charm<br/>
it, but ack! you can&#39;t due to the macro must run its course... you can see<br/>
the potential problem)<br/>
