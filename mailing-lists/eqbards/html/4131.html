<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742117843"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yup it works quite well, be a bit careful with weapons as <br/>
&gt; humanoid types (orcs, skeletons, etc) will wield those<br/>
&gt; weapons as well.  Of course it would be kinda funny to see<br/>
&gt; a skeleton with a BIBS :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was thinking more along the lines of a lucky fire beetle with a<br/>
lightstone, or maybe a bat with a nice gem in their belly or something. A<br/>
snake with a rusty sword or spear would be kind of odd I think..  :)</div>
