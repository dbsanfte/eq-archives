<br/>
Glad to hear you&#39;re back. I have to confess that I haven&#39;t been playing <br/>
Windleaf lately. I just don&#39;t have much time to play when I do and I hate <br/>
spending all that time waiting for a group, and I&#39;m definitely burned out <br/>
on solo kiting stuff right now. I will admit, I haven&#39;t really checked out <br/>
Burning Woods or much of Velious. But for me, BW would just be soloing and <br/>
I tried a couple of times to find groups in Velious, but wasted most of my <br/>
time doing that and did more soloing. Ugh. Also, I don&#39;t get much exp from <br/>
Karnor&#39;s nor loot for that matter, which to me is no fun.<br/>
<br/>
So I started a new bard for the heck of it equiped with tizmak/ulthork <br/>
armor (looks nice). It&#39;s fun to be able to solo melee again, but I&#39;ve got <br/>
to tell you, it&#39;s awful trying to weave in Hymn and not having any &quot;string&quot; <br/>
skill. I forgot all about that. Missed notes left and right. If you find a <br/>
note lying on the ground it was probably dropped by me. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I will admit that I did an entire level by just giving bone chips to the <br/>
dwarf in Kaladim, but I definitely paid for it with real awful skills. :-P<br/>
