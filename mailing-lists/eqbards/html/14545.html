<b>Subject:</b> RE: Hidden Lava Tunnel in the temple of Sol Ro <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099708425">I noticed this in the Lava last night in the temple, it is under the bridge<br/>
in the main chamber. You swim down and it takes you to a larger chamber,<br/>
you have to swim up the lavafall to get back out so I didn&#39;t want to stay<br/>
down there too long to look around. Anyone know what is down here, is it<br/>
just some crappy area that does nothing?<br/>
<br/>
There is also a tunnel in Sol B that goes under the king room. I swam along<br/>
it once and came up in a small room (I guess it&#39;s somewhere to swim if you<br/>
can&#39;t get out of the lava).<br/>
<br/>
I had a bad weekend though, died 3 times last night in Mistmoore whilst<br/>
camping the Cloaked Vampire (our monk tried to pull Lasna and kinda brought<br/>
the whole castle with him, was not a pretty sight. This happened twice, my<br/>
3rd death was for some unknown reason a damn caster saw me whilst f*cking<br/>
invis (in the area before the castle) and somehow killed me in one cast<br/>
while I was naked.<br/>
<br/>
Stupid stupid game.<br/>
