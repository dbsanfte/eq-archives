<div id="ygrps-yiv-994220067">One more stick to add to the fire.  Just read this on the Concert Hall<br/>
board.  The original poster got it off another board, EQCastersRealm I<br/>
believe.  The poster on that board apparently made his inferences based on a<br/>
conversation with GZ.  <br/>

re: Agility vs. AC <br/>
by Kellen 	posted 11/10/99 11:41:40 AM 	<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the gist of the post is what the role of STR, DEX, AGI, AC and ATK<br/>
in combat. Using a statement made by GZ of Verant (I forget the exact<br/>
quote), when he was asked a similar question by the monks, the following was<br/>
revealed:<br/>
<br/>
To Hit:<br/>
<br/>
Attacker&#39;s ATK rating vs. Opponent&#39;s Defense Skill and Agility <br/>
<br/>
Amount of Damage:<br/>
<br/>
Attacker&#39;s Weapon DMG + Weapon Skill + Strength Bonuses vs. Opponent&#39;s AC,<br/>
Defense Skill and Agility.<br/>
<br/>
Both are calculated using a die-roll (random number) so they&#39;re not<br/>
consistent.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... <br/>
<br/>
ATK rating is calculated using Weapon Skill, Offense Skill, and Strength<br/>
AC is calculated using Defense Skill, Agility, and Equipment<br/>
<br/>
Note that DEX is *not* used in calculating &quot;to hit&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
What does DEX and AGI do?<br/>
<br/>
DEX - used to determine how often weapon procs. used to determine critical<br/>
hits (melee and range weapons). <br/>
<br/>
What is unconfirmed but is generally accepted:<br/>
<br/>
DEX - used to determine how often dual wield/double attack goes off<br/>
AGI - used to determine how often dodge/parry/block/riposte goes off<br/>
<br/>
Since bards are capped too low for dodge, I wouldn&#39;t use it as a reason to<br/>
bump up agility. The main reason is to get hit less and get less damage from<br/>
hits, per above. AC is just as important however so find a balance between<br/>
the two.<br/>

&gt; i remember this patch in beta.  what i believe happened is not the type of<br/>
&gt; armor affecting how hard you are hit, but how much the AC stat of each<br/>
&gt; type<br/>
&gt; of armor contributed to your total overall AC.  i remember lots of casters<br/>
&gt; yelling how they lost as much as 100 AC points from their total, as i was<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; wizard and remember well.  i.e. plate armor will add more over and above<br/>
&gt; its<br/>
&gt; actual AC stat than will cloth armor.  therefore your total AC goes up<br/>
&gt; differently based on your level, agility, defense skill, and armor type.<br/>
&gt; i<br/>
&gt; do not know if plate armor has more absorbing value, just that it adds<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; AC over and above its stats.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; just a theory, i could be totally off-base.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I want to believe that you are 100% correct.  However, gonna <br/>
&gt; &gt; put on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; devil&#39;s advocate hat here for the sake of discussion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; First:  There is a big difference between the AC of a caster <br/>
&gt; &gt; and the AC of<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone wearing platemail, especially if they are the same <br/>
&gt; &gt; level.  The only<br/>
&gt; &gt; way a caster will have a higher AC over a plate wearing class <br/>
&gt; &gt; is if they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher in level and get the benefit of a higher Defense skill <br/>
&gt; &gt; rating.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; the observations where you have seen casters getting hit for <br/>
&gt; &gt; more damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; than plate wearers, were the casters a lot higher in level or <br/>
&gt; &gt; similar in<br/>
&gt; &gt; level to the plate wearing classes?  If they were a lot <br/>
&gt; &gt; higher in level and<br/>
&gt; &gt; therefore, in theory, had AC values that were close to one <br/>
&gt; &gt; another, then the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact that the caster was getting hit for more damage than the <br/>
&gt; &gt; platemail<br/>
&gt; &gt; wearer could be attributed to the platemail deflecting part <br/>
&gt; &gt; of the blow.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; the caster and platemail wearer were similar in levels, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can compare the two.  The platemail wearer would almost <br/>
&gt; &gt; certainly have had a<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher AC than the caster and therefore shouldn&#39;t have been <br/>
&gt; &gt; hit for as much<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage.  <br/>
