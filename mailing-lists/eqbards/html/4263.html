&gt; Actually FBR is Flowing Black Robe.  I don&#39;t think we should get too worked<br/>
&gt; up with the acronyms usage.  There are really not too many of them.  RTS<br/>
&gt; stands for Runed Totem Staff, it is also pretty common.  Here are a few<br/>
&gt; common EQ acronyms for anyone who wants to know:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;p.s. I DO know what FBR is...Full Black Robe.  But I guess that is just<br/>
&gt; &gt;because<br/>
&gt; &gt;for the last 5 days some idiot has been screaming it across east karana,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;each time he does some person new to the area, generally barbarians, will<br/>
&gt; &gt;shout<br/>
&gt; &gt;back...&quot;What is a FBR?&quot;<br/>
