&gt;&gt; And then there are those with he hours to be much higher than we<br/>
&gt;&gt; are, but can&#39;t seem to figure out how to make those hours turn into<br/>
&gt;&gt; levels :(<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; ...What I&#39;m REALLY looking forward to though is hitting level 20. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; want to get a last name at least once...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Come to Innoruuk, heh.  I think I could bring you to L20 in a few<br/>
&gt;  sittings ;-)  I&#39;ve got nothing else to do! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I turn down. Getting to level 20, though I want to do it, is something<br/>
I want to do on my own power.  I do not want to be experience-twinked<br/>
to get there. That would take the fun out of the journey.<br/>
