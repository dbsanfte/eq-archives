 </span></blockquote>Yeah, when a cleric friend and I were playing in Lower Guk, I<br/>
charmed two shin ghoul knights into fighting each other.  She<br/>
asked which one was charmed, I told her, then she proceeded to<br/>
nuke the uncharmed one.  The charmed ghoul knight finished at<br/>
almost full health (which we had to kill), and after heals and<br/>
all she&#39;d used about 60% of her mana.  Next time I told her to<br/>
just wait until one killed the other before attacking.  The<br/>
fight took longer (these are melee mobs after all), but she<br/>
used less than a half bubble of mana (one spell- lol) and we<br/>
were ready to go for the next.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been using the song a lot lately since Pixie Strike is<br/>
broken (I tried it about 20 times on Froon, and it *never*<br/>
worked despite not being resisted almost every time).  If<br/>
you&#39;re not in a dungeon where lots of greens might attack a<br/>
pet (Permafrost, Cazic), Siren&#39;s is an excellent way to make 2<br/>
and 3 mob fights easier than 1 mob fights.  Several times in<br/>
the Minotaur patriarch room, we&#39;ve gotten a successive stream<br/>
of 6-8 mobs due to spawns and wanderers joining the fight.  <br/>
Since it&#39;s almost always only 2-3 mobs at a time, I just charm<br/>
the extra into attacking the one the others are fighting and<br/>
we actually end up doing better than if we&#39;d fought each one<br/>
at a time in succession.  I&#39;ve even had a corpse go *poof*<br/>
because the charmed mob did more damage than the other 4 tanks<br/>
combined (with the new group damage rules).<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I think I&#39;ve figured out that really annoying bug<br/>
where a charmed creature attacks a player.  When you re-charm,<br/>
your pet attacks whatever is at the top of its hate list (bard<br/>
excepted since charm makes it view you amiably).  When you&#39;re<br/>
playing solo and charm a mob into attacking another, the other<br/>
mob damages your pet and thus builds hatred.  When you<br/>
recharm, the mob is tops on your pet&#39;s hate list so your pet<br/>
re-attacks without you having to order it.<br/>
<br/>
But when you&#39;re playing grouped, the extra mob(s) usually<br/>
attack party members instead of your pet, and thus your pet is<br/>
never damaged and never hates the other mobs.  But some party<br/>
members probably attacked it, or gained hatred for pulling it,<br/>
so upon recharm, your pet automatically attacks the player.  I<br/>
know charm clears the damage list, but I guess it doesn&#39;t<br/>
clear the hatred list - it just puts the bard on top - which<br/>
is why you can use it to pull stuff off after it&#39;s frenzied<br/>
on someone.<br/>
<br/>
If this is what&#39;s going on, we have to be careful how we asked<br/>
that this be fixed.  If it were fixed by just clearing the<br/>
hate list, then we&#39;d have to give the mob a new attack command<br/>
every time we recharmed it, which may be worse than the bug.  <br/>
It&#39;d have to be fixed by just wiping players (except the bard)<br/>
off the hate list.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, you can avoid the bug by making sure you or<br/>
another mob are tops on your pet&#39;s hate list.  Either you have<br/>
to pull (so everything hates only you by the time you charm),<br/>
or if there are 3+ mobs you have to get two of them fighting<br/>
each other so that they hate each other more than any player.  <br/>
If there are only two mobs and both are already attacking<br/>
another player, then there&#39;s nothing you can do - you&#39;ll have<br/>
to keep giving the back off and attack command every time you<br/>
recharm.<br/>
