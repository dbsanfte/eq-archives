<div id="ygrps-yiv-911397102"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Early Platemail was cast from Iron,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it was not cast, not even the bronze plate of the ancient Greeks was cast. It was hammered and<br/>
reasonably light (the leather and scale suit I used to fight in was about 60 lbs plate actually can<br/>
be lighter and being distributed evenly over your body is a HECK of a lot easier to deal with than a<br/>
60 lb. backpack.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Early platemail was<br/>
&gt;so damned thick and heavy, if a knight were to be knocked from his warhorse<br/>
&gt;(horses bred specifically to be able to carry a knight) it meant likely<br/>
&gt;death, the knight trapped like a turtle on its back in the hot sun.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, these are myths based on literature and parody illustrations of the day and a modern<br/>
misunderstanding of the differences between battle and jousting armour.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen a fully armoured person do summersaults and vault a 4 foot pole, I have seen them lythly<br/>
hop up from a prone position on the ground. This was wearing armour of a period thickness hammered<br/>
of regular steel, not stainless.<br/>
<br/>
Armour designed specifically for the de-horsing period in jousting got very VERY heavy and very<br/>
specialized but this stuff was never used on the battlefield. Battlefeild armour remained a balance<br/>
between weight and flexibility.<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing about a fallen knight being like a turtle is a myth, now, that being said, a dozen<br/>
peasents with polearms pulling a knight off his horse and shoving a itty bitty knife through his<br/>
visor is a GOOD idea *laughs* and certainly happened. The famous illustration of putting a knight on<br/>
his horse with block and tackle was a *parody* illustration, not historical documentation.<br/>
<br/>
No one<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;forged stainless steel in those days.  (Come to think of it, maybe the EQ<br/>
&gt;plate is made of stainless steel.)  Little of this early armor remains, only<br/>
&gt;those pieces from especially short individuals, which no one else could fit<br/>
&gt;into, when said short individual died within it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Plenty of this armour remains in collections throughout the world. A whole lot more is manufactured<br/>
by modern smiths using period techniques based on these existing pieces.<br/>
