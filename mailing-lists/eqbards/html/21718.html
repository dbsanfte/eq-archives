<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650363931">I like your analogy but would say VI&#39;s is even farther removed.  It&#39;s like<br/>
they saw you without shoes in the parking lot and even though you had shoes<br/>
on when you came into the store they refused you service because &quot;you were<br/>
one of those no shoe wearing types&quot; regardless of the fact that you<br/>
comported yourself satisfactorily while within their establishment.<br/>
<br/>
In the original thread on the EQ boards, I slapped up (what I felt) was a<br/>
decent analogy of this... here goes:  If I go into a store that has a &quot;No<br/>
Shirt/No Shoes&quot; sign while wearing sandals, purchase a Coke then leave the<br/>
store, I have entered into a brief contract with that establishment.  They<br/>
agreed that I had met their criteria to purchase a product, I did so, deal<br/>
done.</div>
