 </span></blockquote>The water and slime crystal staves use the same graphics as<br/>
the staves the GMs use, which I think raises the coolness<br/>
factor.  :-)  My friends keep teasing me about it though,<br/>
calling a giant Q-tip.  *I* think they&#39;re just jealous because<br/>
their class can&#39;t use it.<br/>

Magic 1h-blunt weapons are hard to come by.  The first my<br/>
friends and I got was a screaming mace, which is quite an<br/>
undertaking to obtain.  So while the damage on the water and<br/>
slime crystal staves is nothing spectacular (5/28), they are<br/>
good weapons to pull out every couple levels to top off your<br/>
1h-blunt skill.  The *optimal* 1h blunt bard weapon to do this<br/>
past about level 20 would probably be a cold iron morningstar<br/>
(9/38? 9/35? and 4.5 lbs), but it&#39;s a rare drop.<br/>
