 </span></blockquote>I was with some guildmates hanging around for the Hero to show himself.<br/>
We tried everything, killing minos, killing Meldrath and guards, clearing<br/>
the area of drakes, skeletons, rogue clockworks, etc., to no avail<br/>
(although they were entertained from my training runs, punching every mob<br/>
nearby, running back to the cave entrance and watching ~15 creatures in a<br/>
cartoonish herd stampede towards me).<br/>
<br/>
We spent a good four hours around there.  Is there a [new] trigger for<br/>
getting the Hero to spawn?<br/>
