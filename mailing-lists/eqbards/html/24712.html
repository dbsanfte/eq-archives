<div id="ygrps-yiv-713999954">I disagree.  Charming would become safer, but you&#39;d pay a price for <br/>
it.  You would be burning through mana at a faster rate, ensuring you <br/>
were OOM MUCH sooner (recharming every 10 seconds instead of 15).  <br/>
It&#39;s also not fool proof, resists or early breaks would be a problem <br/>
because you&#39;d have to get into command range to direct your pet.  The <br/>
only way to really combat resists or early breaks would be to recharm <br/>
even sooner, which would further speed up mana burn.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I believe all other forms of charm are refreshable AND Bard <br/>
charm is refreshable on PVP servers.  Doesn&#39;t seem overpowering in <br/>
the least to me.<br/>

charms...</div>
