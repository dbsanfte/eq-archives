<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511018496">OOOH I am soo in agreement with this, I have been SOO lucky lately in cazic<br/>
I met a pure warrior thats his 2ndary character(he has a 40th level &quot;other &quot;<br/>
character&quot; we dont talk much about our other characaters. BUT he is most of<br/>
the time the &quot;main &quot; puller for my group at all times. When I join the group<br/>
even when im the last one to be invited to the group I let them no my rules<br/>
for being in the group. IF they dont follow them i e assisting the puller at<br/>
all times, I will go find another group. AND now I seem to be leveling like<br/>
a crazed madman now. the assist command is awsome. one mob drops after<br/>
another. AND 99% of the time i am grouped with my best bud same level<br/>
enchanter whom lets us take ONE mob at a time no matter how many mobs are<br/>
pulled.<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 coppers pieces. :)<br/>

&gt;I hate when people go select their own mobs in groups<br/>
&gt;to attack.  With or without lullaby--everyone should<br/>
&gt;be targetting the same MOB.  So many people in this<br/>
&gt;game don&#39;t seem to understand.<br/>
