<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789712997">With charisma items and the Carillon, you essentially &quot;rent&quot; steel armor.  You should be able to sell it back at about 90% of the purchase price.  So your real question is whether the extra AC is worth about 10% of the cost of the items, and, for the most part, it probably is.  Just don&#39;t overencumber yourself.  Besides, you look cool.<br/>

&gt;     But anyway - I got to the armor store in E Freeport and look at the Steel Plate.  I notice that they mostly offer 1 or 2 AC points above the equivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.  Question is - is it worth it? ... </span></blockquote></div>
