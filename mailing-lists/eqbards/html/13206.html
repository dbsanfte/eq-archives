<div id="ygrps-yiv-944673340">I don&#39;t think about adding Bind as a way to increase the Bard&#39;s power.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
like adding better weapons or instruments, which allow better survival and<br/>
easier soloing.  It isn&#39;t like Gate which allows for convienient travel and easy<br/>
escapes.<br/>
<br/>
Bind does nothing for you, except help decrease the downtime you experience<br/>
returning to your body.  Since our song structure forces us to taunt every mob<br/>
in combat radius, we get more than our share of damage.  Since we have the same<br/>
defense as a Caster, we die much more than our Hybrid and Melee counterparts.  I<br/>
believe this to be a balance issue to even things out a bit.  We still die more,<br/>
and level slower due to exp loss, but our play time can get a little closer to<br/>
everyone elses.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t add power to the class.  Just let us play almost as much as everyone else<br/>
on the server, and spend a smaller percentage of our time running back to our<br/>
corpses.  Everyone in Norrath pays the same amount of money to play, shouldn&#39;t<br/>
we get the same, or almost the same, amount of productive playing time as<br/>
everyone else?<br/>

&gt;the other classes, lets come up with the unique, &quot;only a bard..&quot;<br/>
&gt;solution.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;We don&#39;t bind.  We don&#39;t gate.  We don&#39;t disarm.  We play songs.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;How about instruments that double as weapons, etc.   Drums that<br/>
&gt;when played look like different instruments.  The bard is the class<br/>
&gt;that could most have a unique solution.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Play a bard because its different, not because it is just another<br/>
&gt;clone of every other class. </span></blockquote></div>
