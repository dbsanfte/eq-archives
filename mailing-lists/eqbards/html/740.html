&gt;   For those quick browsers of messages, here is my<br/>
&gt; warning.  I used the first level attack song alternating<br/>
&gt; it mainly with the level 2 buff song when fighting in and<br/>
&gt; around my home town of Kelethin.  Occasionally, when I run<br/>
&gt; back to town (NEVER still singing my attack song), a guard<br/>
&gt; will kill me for no apparent reason.  Maybe it thinks I<br/>
&gt; attacked another PC if he or she happened to run by, but I<br/>
&gt; really don&#39;t know.  I fear that I have lost faction with<br/>
&gt; my town, though I receive no messages about it.  <br/>
&gt; Shopkeepers now look at me apprehensively, except for my<br/>
&gt; guild of course.<br/>

merchants in Kelethin view all wood elves apprehensively.  <br/>
I&#39;d /bug it.<br/>
