&gt; &gt;The worst are are effect spells.  Those will drop my Celeron<br/>
&gt; &gt;450 with Voodoo3 card (overclocked to 3000 speed) to about 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;frames per second, even at low particle density.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is why I have taken to turning particle density OFF in a large group <br/>
&gt; and always tell my group members they should too. I have a PIII-450 with a <br/>
&gt; Viper 770 and 256MB of ram and I still get massive lag in caster heavy <br/>
&gt; battles.  The only problem with PD being off is that many songs and spells <br/>
&gt; give no visual clue.  Verant should make it so there is something, even a <br/>
&gt; little glow.  As it is I have to pay very close attention to the text <br/>
&gt; messages in battle to weave well, it can get very tedious.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, that&#39;s why I leave it on low.  If I&#39;m busy charming or<br/>
mesmerizing or raising everyone&#39;s resist, I have to know<br/>
whether or not my party needs me to chain as well, and I<br/>
usually can&#39;t tell if I can&#39;t see the root graphic effects<br/>
swirling around the mob.<br/>
<br/>
Since you have a 770 (TNT2, right?), can I ask what card you<br/>
had before, and how you feel about the performance of the 770?<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of upgrading from my Voodoo3 to a TNT2 card.  <br/>
The V3 speed is very nice, but the color banding is obvious<br/>
and I think it&#39;s a bit slow with the heavy spell effects.  The<br/>
spell effects don&#39;t seem to lag the card as badly in glide<br/>
mode, but framerate is a bit slower and the banding is even<br/>
worse.<br/>
