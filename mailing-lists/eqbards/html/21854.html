&gt; i don&#39;t understand how that would prove that an enchanter is a waste of <br/>
&gt; a spot pre 50.  if you have a good feign puller, you will never have more<br/>
&gt; than one mob.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The difference is, with a monk pulling, you sit around waiting a lot<br/>
more while the monk separates the mobs. And, of course, as you get up to<br/>
a higher level, mobs stop believing the monk and you have to start chain<br/>
pulling, which takes even less time.<br/>
<br/>
Are you really arguing that a well played enchanter is not one of the<br/>
most effective grouping characters in the game?<br/>
