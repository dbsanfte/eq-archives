really cannot support this type of play-density (one party per<br/>
dungeon) at $10/mo.  A viable alternative at present is<br/>
setting up your own server and inviting only your friends to<br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think spawning a new copy of a dungeon for each party<br/>
is the solution.  I think the long-term solution is to just<br/>
make the game world so large that the players-per-zone density<br/>
(using the term &quot;zone&quot; loosely) is low enough that running<br/>
into another party in a dungeon is a rarity.  To discourage<br/>
camping, you could tweak down the spawn rates, and make<br/>
finding the &quot;boss&quot; mob that drops the nice items contingent on<br/>
your party killing enough of the &quot;trash&quot; mobs (with random<br/>
variances of course).  So to get the nice item, you have to<br/>
find the &quot;boss.&quot;  To get the &quot;boss&quot; you have to clear the<br/>
trash.  To clear the trash, you have to sweep through the<br/>
dungeon because sitting in one place waiting for a respawn<br/>
would take too long.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d also need to tweak the AI to discourage pull-camping.  <br/>
The reason it works in EQ is because the mob AI is<br/>
predictable, and IMHO once it&#39;s predictable, it&#39;s not AI<br/>
anymore.  Better AI would also let the dungeon deal with<br/>
massive raids (i.e. people think it&#39;s too hard to do it in a<br/>
small party so bring in 30 friends to clear everything<br/>
easily).  Instead of the mobs fighting, they see the army, run<br/>
away, and build their own army.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the really worrying thing about all this is that in<br/>
real life, in a typical food chain, the &quot;prey&quot; has about 10x<br/>
the biomass of the &quot;predator.&quot;  And that&#39;s for predators<br/>
killing only for sustinence.  If that translates over to<br/>
online RPGs (and you could probably come up with a good<br/>
argument that it doesn&#39;t), you&#39;re talking about the server<br/>
needing to control at least 10x as many NPCs as PCs.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you assume we&#39;re at about a 1:1 ratio of NPCs<br/>
and PCs right now, and Moore&#39;s Law says that in about 5 years<br/>
computers will be 10x faster...<br/>
