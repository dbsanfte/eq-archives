<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217161158">camping/list wise it was great back then, cause it was one or two groups in<br/>
the zone tops.  and then we just moved on until the avatar and by then my<br/>
exp was maxing for the zone and i was tired of losing rubi bp lottos, so i<br/>
moved on to sol B for the rest.  was the only group there too.  i love those<br/>
days.  the difference between waiting 8 hours to get in the king hall group<br/>
and not finding enough people to START a king hall group.<br/>
