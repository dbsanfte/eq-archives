<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414563487">Usually the first thing I ever do when I charm something is give it a /pet <br/>
back off command to reset it&#39;s aggro list. Not only does /pet attack work <br/>
every time after you do a /pet back off (well it does for me), it will keep <br/>
your pet from attacking your party members, which I have seen numerous <br/>
times.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] 39th charm song<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, 23 Oct 2000 08:07:46 -1000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I started playing my bard again after a 4 month break.  The lute strings<br/>
&gt;required a little fine tuning but it wasn&#39;t too hard to get back in the<br/>
&gt;swing of things.  One thing I did have trouble with was using this song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had just dinged into 39 when I stopped playing the first time.  So I <br/>
&gt;never<br/>
&gt;had the opportunity to use this song.  Here is the problem I had.  Group<br/>
&gt;would pull two mobs and I would charm the second one.  I would get the eyes<br/>
&gt;glaze over message.  I would then target the first mob and give the /pet<br/>
&gt;attack command.  Problem is my pet just stood there and did not attack.  I<br/>
&gt;kept hitting /pet attack on several occasions but I could never get it to<br/>
&gt;work.  In this situation, the mob we were attacking never attacked me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So then later on I tried it again.  Different scenario this time.  Puller<br/>
&gt;agrroed two mobs and snared one.  So the second mob took longer to arrive <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;the party.  I was attacking first mob, buffing party etc before the second<br/>
&gt;mob got there.  I charmed second mob when it arrived, initial mob attacked<br/>
&gt;me, and then my pet responded and started attacking the first mob.  After<br/>
&gt;charm wore off and I recharmed it, it automatically attacked the first mob<br/>
&gt;again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not certain why I could not get my charmed mob to attack in the first<br/>
&gt;situation.  Besides the mana drain, is there a difference how the 39 charm<br/>
&gt;works compared to the original version?<br/>
