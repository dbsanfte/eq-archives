   I have managed to get my Alcohol Tolerance (AT) to 28 mainly by<br/>
drinking a lot of Short Beers.  I have a distinct advantage in that they<br/>
are a natural by-product of one of my Trade Skills, Brewing.  I know is<br/>
takes MANY a brew to get an increase so keep on drinking!!<br/>

&gt; Ok, here is a good one:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who can tell me anything about alcohol tolerance?  I drink different kinds<br/>
&gt; and quantities of Alcohol in the game but do not really know how this<br/>
works<br/>
&gt; to raise your skill in Alcohol Tolerance.  Has anyone been successful at<br/>
&gt; raising this skill and if so, what are the best alcohols to drink to do<br/>
so,<br/>
&gt; and which ones are not?  I have been drinking primarily mead and not<br/>
&gt; noticing much improvement.<br/>
