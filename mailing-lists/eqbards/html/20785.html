<br/>
&gt; Well, if I&#39;m twisting songs I count &quot;one-one-thousand, <br/>
&gt; two-one-thousand,<br/>
&gt; three-one-th...&quot; at that point, I hit the next song.  What <br/>
&gt; this does, is let<br/>
&gt; me start another song before my previous one&#39;s effect has <br/>
&gt; hit.  If I get my<br/>
&gt; timing juuuuuuuust right, I can do 4... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I count one(hit song)...two...three...four(stop song), watch for gem to<br/>
fill, one(start next song).  But essentially we&#39;re doing the same thing.<br/>
The only way I can get 3 songs to stack is if I time it exactly and have the<br/>
&quot;Your song ends&quot; come up before the songs effect message.  :shrugs  <br/>
<br/>
Stopping the song before the effect was never too hard for me.  Starting the<br/>
next too soon was a bigger problem.  But I have found that juggling<br/>
instruments has helped prevent the &quot;You haven&#39;t recovered yet&quot; messages.<br/>
The time it takes to stop the song, reach over, click the mouse to switch<br/>
instruments, then bring my hand back to the numpad is just about the time it<br/>
takes for the gem to ungrey itself.  Though if I get a faster PC I may have<br/>
switch my keyboard mapping around again.<br/>

better at Lag Hunting (564)]  Every time it&#39;d spike I&#39;d think &quot;that&#39;s it,<br/>

I&#39;d won the battle.  ;^)<br/>
