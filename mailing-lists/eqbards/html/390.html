<div id="ygrps-yiv-260887261">A bit of advice from personal experience. Until you&#39;re about level 11 or<br/>
12, never bust an orc camp without Lamenting them and having a good cleric<br/>
with you. Those centurions can mess you up real quick. If you&#39;re unlucky to<br/>
have a legionairre in the mix then you&#39;ll be seeing Freeport faster than you<br/>
can turn around. Oracles are not so bad. Apprentices are weak but they like<br/>
to blind you, very disconcerting when a cent is beating the life outta you.<br/>
<br/>
	As far as groups go at that level, I&#39;d try North Ro. Most of the creatures<br/>
there are solitary and a good fetcher will bring it back to the grassy area.<br/>
This allows you to Wince away without fear of pulling anything big in. It<br/>
also means you&#39;ll drain less water. Lastly, the guard is near in case things<br/>
go way bad unless you&#39;re taking on madmen, dervish, or pumas. I&#39;ve also<br/>
found the people in North Ro to be a bit more serious about grouping than<br/>
anywhere else since the distribution of creatures almost requires a group to<br/>
get anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
	And the biggest thing about North Ro... No griffins!<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

Sorry if this has been addressed... I&#39;m finding level 9 to be excruciatingly<br/>
slow going...  Any pointers?  I spent a huge amount of time tonight with a<br/>
large group at east commons orc camp.  They want me to use the Discord<br/>
song - so all the orcs jump me.  I get killed instantly.  The rest proceed<br/>
to wipe out the rest as I memorize and work my way back.  Before I get<br/>
there - they all decide it&#39;s late and log off.  Not a one bothered to wait<br/>
and offer me a share of silver or loot...  Wasted about an hour and ended up<br/>
with LESS XP than I started..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m under the impression now - I&#39;m better off pairing off with someone at<br/>
this point than trying large groups...  Large seem to take forever to do<br/>
anyting - and I&#39;m not getting much xp or loot..<br/>
