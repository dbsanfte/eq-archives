<div id="ygrps-yiv-437724153">Well, grats on the Kisch :P I traded mine and now kinda wish I still <br/>
had it now (I don&#39;t own much in the way of weapons...just an EBW and <br/>
a couple of Obsidian Shards).  I was in Paw again recently and <br/>
checked on ol D&#39;Nmark and he was up but with no sword :(<br/>
<br/>
I am curious why you were so excited about getting the Sharkskin Drum <br/>
after getting the Tamborine though.  I know you already have a Selo&#39;s <br/>
Drum as well, but the Tamborine seems to me to be the best choice of <br/>
drums for those without a Selo&#39;s Drum.  Not too mention that it&#39;s No <br/>
Drop (and god do I love no drop instruments hehe).<br/>

&gt; Just a couple of notes on recent loots.  Went to Paw, ostensibly to <br/>
help my 31 wiz get some exp but ended up going all the way to the <br/>
back where the &quot;old&quot; commander&#39;s room used to be.  Killed lots of <br/>
gnolls and ended up with the Kirch de&#39; Pav (sp?) the 1hs&#39;er that <br/>
procs poison.  Have not even equipped it - prolly hand it off to one <br/>
of my low level twinks or a needy young bard (are there any of those <br/>
left these days?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, spent more hours than I wanted to camping for the Royal Crown <br/>
of Dalnir ancient coin.  Got it finally and finished that quest.  <br/>
Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine.  Did not bother to equip that one either.  <br/>
Sigh.  Getting pretty jaded it seems.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And then for the really good part.  Sunday afternoon, we put <br/>
together a guild group: me 52 bard, 53 Mage, 51 Necro, 51 Wizard, 52 <br/>
Cleric & 47 Pally.  Off to Kedge Keep!  I must admit that the other 2 <br/>
or 3 times that I have been there it was with 2 or more guild-groups <br/>
with 2 enchanters so I was a bit leery of how bad we might get <br/>
smooshed.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We were the only folks in the zone and we just cleared our way in <br/>
past the green trash and down to the second level.  Phineas was up <br/>
but I doubted that we had the where-with-all to handle him so we went <br/>
looking for the other names.  We cleared into Cauldron Boil&#39;s room <br/>
but he was gone. Then over to Estrella - also not at home. Then we <br/>
only had an hour left so we went to look for Undertow who was afk.  <br/>
And finally we ended up killing off all the sea horses and started to <br/>
work the re-spawn for exp.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Follow me! (famous last words)&quot; I tell my group and we swim out of <br/>
the sea horse cave and see a re-spawn.  I target it, see that it is a <br/>
named, and my jaw drops when I see that it&#39;s none other than Coralyn <br/>
Kelpmaiden and she is wielding the drum!  Errm, the lute!  No, the <br/>
drum that only looks like a lute!  No, no, the lute that actually is <br/>
a drum!  It&#39;s all part of &quot;The Vision(tm)&quot; or is it just part of &quot;The <br/>
Smell(tm)&quot; ???  Anyhow, I screamed: &quot;KILL THIS NOW!!!!&quot; And a few <br/>
short moments later, looted the Sharkskin Drum.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got a lot of nice comments from the group on how well the pulls <br/>
went.  Only a couple times did we have more than a single <br/>
mob/fish/sea horse to deal with.  Hard to know if it&#39;s because at 52 <br/>
singles pull or was the lament song really working or what.  Next <br/>
time, I have enough confidence to try pulling Phinnie&#39;s Guards and <br/>
then the big fish himself.<br/>
