&gt; 35th level Selo&#39;s with MM is probably AS fast as SoC, and 36th is<br/>

Your race results fall in line with what I&#39;ve suspected all<br/>
along - that SoC is just 2x running speed.  A L35 bard with a<br/>
Mistmoore drum is slightly slower than 2x running speed, a L36<br/>
bard with a MM drum is slightly faster.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no real answer to &quot;when is Selo&#39;s as fast as SoW&quot;<br/>
because SoW becomes faster as the caster levels.  But if you<br/>
extrapolate my results to the lower levels, Accel is *always*<br/>
faster than like-level SoW.  Based on some timings I&#39;ve yet to<br/>
send to Rokken, Accel with a drum at about L15 is faster than<br/>
L49 SoW, and a L40 bard without a drum is faster than L49 SoW.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Damn, I&#39;ve been walking all this time...&quot;<br/>
