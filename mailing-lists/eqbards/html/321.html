Does that mean that when I die in North Karanas, and I run around<br/>
the newbie zone singing Dissonance, killing everything withing sight,<br/>
to get some gold to buy food for the trip back, that I am farming?<br/>
My friend consistenly lures monsters our way with spells, to save<br/>
us the hassle of chasing it down.  Is this farming?<br/>
<br/>
Here come some more, from the web site:<br/>
     Price Gouging ´┐¢ finding items that have anomalous pricing and<br/>
abusing them, such as items that sell for more than they cost to buy.<br/>
<br/>
OK, this one seems to make some sense.  If an NPC has lost his mind<br/>
and is selling fine steel swords for 1gp, and buys it back off you for<br/>
1pp.<br/>
<br/>
     PvP Switch Avoidance ´┐¢ Using in-game methods to work around the PvP<br/>
switch and allowing non-PvP players to kill other players,<br/>
     such as hall blocking, dumping of monsters, or spell effects that<br/>
cross that boundary due to a bug. <br/>
<br/>
Dumping of monsters?!  I&#39;d like someone to prove that I was<br/>
intentionally dumping the monster, and not just running for the guard.<br/>
But I guess that&#39;s the point, isn&#39;t it?  Verant don&#39;t have to prove<br/>
anything, do they?<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a larger issue here.  In a word, it is &#39;Verant&#39;.<br/>
I am impressed with the game, but unimpressed with Verant, on so<br/>
many levels.  I have come close to cancelling my account once already.<br/>
