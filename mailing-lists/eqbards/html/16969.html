<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731187262">I&#39;m not sure I understand the numbers here.  Looks<br/>
like 68 per tick which is still great damage (I do<br/>
about 14-15 with my barbed leather whip at 14th lvl)<br/>
<br/>
Question though -- I recently tried to see how much<br/>
COD does during combat.  Disbanded with my best<br/>
hunting buddy, both us us hit duel and ... COD didn&#39;t<br/>
affect him at all.  I would play (with mandolin and<br/>
without) and the song would simply end a tick later.  <br/>
<br/>
What went wrong?<br/>
<br/>
I am really curious about maxing damage in combat. If<br/>
COD only does 2 damage per round, regardless of level<br/>
(without instrument) then it&#39;s probably only useful<br/>
below 10th lvl.<br/>
<br/>
I did use COD a lot at 3rd-12th lvl and,while I had to<br/>
be careful, had good results.  At 14th lvl tho, I seem<br/>
to do better using bellow.  Opinions?<br/>
