		I&#39;ve noticed for a long time that Bellow has a very low<br/>
resist rate - heck, <br/>
		I learned this as a teenager kiting red scythe beetles in<br/>
North Karana.  I <br/>
		was glad to see it still holds true 25 levels later.  My<br/>
Bellows were <br/>
		usually hitting for 14 to 19 points of damage, which is not<br/>
too bad, all <br/>
		things considered.  My group was doing everything they could<br/>
to lower his <br/>
		magic resistance, but it still wasn&#39;t enough for me to get<br/>
Fufil&#39;s to stick. <br/>
		  I didn&#39;t try Pixie Strike (wihch also lowers magic resist)<br/>
because it has <br/>
		the same dual-save problem Fufil&#39;s does.<br/>
<br/>
		I am always open to suggestions - so what would YOU do in<br/>
this case?<br/>
