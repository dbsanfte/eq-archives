&gt; Rather than let it bum you out, why not see that anyone who would laugh<br/>
&gt; at you for not being 50 yet should be pitied. While I sympathize with<br/>
&gt; your plight however, I also think that this really stems from a bit of<br/>
&gt; jealousy, I also think learning to deal with that can be valuable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I appreciate your advice on working on my coping skills, however, I<br/>
disagree.  I&#39;ve thought about this and what I&#39;m feeling is not jealousy.  I<br/>
am not jealous of the fact that he possesses full Lambent and that I do not,<br/>
nor am I jealous of the fact that he has a set of Yaks, FBSS, Shimmering<br/>
Orb, etc.  There are many bards at my level and higher (and some lower) that<br/>
have those things and I never give it a second thought.  No, what I am<br/>
feeling (and this is the crux of the matter) is resentment and<br/>
discouragement at the diminishment of my questing accomplishments because he<br/>
has full Lambent at level 9.  Again, as I said, seeing this bard in full<br/>
steel would not have bothered me in the slightest, in fact it would have<br/>
made me feel *good* that my investment of time, effort and strategy had<br/>
yielding Lambent armor to me that he was unable to twink himself with but<br/>
instead had to earn with his bard through the same efforts.  As I said in my<br/>
earlier post, I feel that wearing Lambent should automatically reflect the<br/>
effort and time that I personally have put into my bard character by its<br/>
presence on my character&#39;s body.  This would occur if Lambent armor was NO<br/>
DROP.<br/>
