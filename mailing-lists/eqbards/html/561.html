<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870107297">I had read about a similar discussion about how the creatures in East/West<br/>
Commonlands could attack you through the walls of the huts there (highly<br/>
annoying when the griffin comes a knocking). I recall that the reply was not<br/>
so encouraging. It seems to deal with determining LOS (line of sight)<br/>
whenever a creature attacks you. Maybe Verant thinks that putting in this<br/>
code check for every NPC for attacking and reaction purposes would be an<br/>
overload of processing and that realism has to be sacrificed a bit for<br/>
playability.<br/>
<br/>
	Personally I&#39;d say that physically attacking through walls is obviously<br/>
wrong (as is something below a bridge attacking you when you&#39;re on the<br/>
bridge...). Some magical effects I could possibly see work that way. After<br/>
all, magic can teleport you to somewhere very far away. Why wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
able to go past the wall in front.<br/>
<br/>
	And yes I do realize that us players cannot attack through walls by any<br/>
means. Can you imagine all of the exploits if we could though? (which is the<br/>
reason why we can&#39;t anymore)<br/>
<br/>

Heh this bug has been reported tens of thousands of times. The whole<br/>
minotaur mine is bugged. Any creature, or that stupid npc gnome who<br/>
wanders next to you whenver you decide to cast an area effect spell or<br/>
song, can attack through walls. Verant acknowledges it, but hasn&#39;t fixed<br/>
it for some unkown reason.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Actually camo does work occasionally. One time I chased a running mino<br/>
&gt; &gt;and accidently got charmed leading to my death. I came back, and asked a<br/>
&gt; &gt;friend to cast camo on me, and I went about my way using /corpse to pull<br/>
&gt; &gt;my body away from him. He never saw past me, and he didn&#39;t charm me. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;guess its just luck of the draw.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     Assuming the dangerous creature near your corpse can&#39;t detect<br/>
&gt; invisible<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (?) the easiest way to get your corpse back is to find a kindly magic<br/>
&gt; caster<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; type to make you invisible.  Have a hot key equipped with the /corpse<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; command.  Go to your corpse - then walk a bit away - click that<br/>
&gt; button - and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drag your corpse to a safe location...<br/>
