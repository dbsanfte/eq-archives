<b>Subject:</b> Re: Speaking of outrunning Selo&#39;s <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953670259">Without the drum I have been outrun several times.  If they are close a<br/>
lioness can hit you continuously.  I don&#39;t know if it can outrun my but it<br/>
can keep up.  With the drum I can pull away quite easily though.  I would<br/>
like to the thank the person that posted about setting up instruments and<br/>
hot keys.  This has saved my like more than once.  The only modification I<br/>
made is that I also set up another button to put my shield in.  If I pick<br/>
something up it goes in to that slot but I trade what is in that slot for<br/>
the shield.  Almost always I would rather lose what was in that spot than my<br/>
shield if something would happen.  While I am running if I have the chance I<br/>
will put what was in that spot into a backpack.  I don&#39;t worry about losing<br/>
my shield this way.  Just my 2 CP.<br/>
