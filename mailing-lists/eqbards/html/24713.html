<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055638771">Enchanter charm can&#39;t be refreshed, unless it has been changed recently.  At<br/>
higher levels, mobs do WAY more damage than PC&#39;s.  A bard could easily<br/>
outdamage a monk or rogue with refreshable charm.  Mana would not be a real<br/>
issue, just sit down and med between battles.  With non refreshable charm,<br/>
I&#39;m convinced if Verant saw a good charming bard in action, they would nerf<br/>
it.  To eliminate the only real downside to charm, would be too much.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll disagree on this, no biggie :)  A lot of people don&#39;t agree with me on<br/>
how powerful charm is.  There won&#39;t be any changing my mind now though,<br/>
since I can&#39;t use it anymore :(   You know if you charm a spectral curate in<br/>
KC, and you have people low on health, he&#39;ll probably heal them?  Try it<br/>
some time, will freak out your cleric...<br/>
