&gt;Kaearia, Rokenn and other well known bards have been fighting for.  She<br/>
&gt;apparently has no problems with how Verant is handling the many issues<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see a problem with people offering a different point of view. I <br/>
like reading about bard problems when they are objectively posted. John Kim <br/>
always provided an objective and quantified analysis of any problem. These <br/>
type of problems/complaints are constructive and helps build a case to get <br/>
changes made and make an effective squeaky wheel.<br/>
<br/>
However, all of the postings that takes shots at Verant as a company are <br/>
the writer&#39;s opinions, and as such are subject to other opinions.  Does it <br/>
do any good for people on this list to talk about how awful Verant is as a <br/>
company?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One other point to make.  Just because Kitasi (31st level) and I (39th<br/>
&gt;level) are not high level bards doesn&#39;t mean we are not aware of all the<br/>
&gt;problems higher level bards have to put up with.  Both Kitasi and I have<br/>
&gt;been members of this mailing list since it was created.  Because I read this<br/>
&gt;list as well as the Concert Hall board, I probably know more about the 50+<br/>
&gt;bard songs than some of the 50+ bards on my server.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I definitely agree on this. Doesn&#39;t matter how high a level your bard is in <br/>
order to form an opinion. However, any comments you&#39;d make on higher level <br/>
songs are invalid without you performing them yourself. Consequently, you <br/>
never hear me talk about any songs above 40+.<br/>

&gt;primarily functioning as a mana battery, then you don&#39;t have anything to<br/>
&gt;worry about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BTW, the other night I ran into a 54 bard and a 55 bard and asked both of <br/>
them separately if they enjoyed playing their bards and whether they only <br/>
sing manasong. Both said they loved playing them and thought that anyone <br/>
who only played manasong didn&#39;t know what a bard was for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No need for you to get involved with any of the discussions on<br/>
&gt;these issues.  For the other 99% of the bards out there who want full,<br/>
&gt;working functionality out of the class, then there are still issues to<br/>
&gt;discuss.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree there are definite issues to discuss. I just prefer to not have to <br/>
read all the ranting and potshots. In that regard, I almost wonder if <br/>
that&#39;s why John Kim never returned. :-(</div>
