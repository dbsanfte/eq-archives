<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081951583">Depends on what you are fighting.  Heck, I was in a group with 2 mages, an<br/>
enchanter, a druid, and a shaman on seafury island and I still had time<br/>
during the battles to get 4 to 5 procs in with my YK and 1 to 2 with my<br/>
Kisch.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, when I went into Paw last night with 3 druids, a shaman<br/>
and a warrior, nothing lived long enough for me to hit it, much less proc.<br/>
<br/>
In the grand scheme of things, my damage is token anyhow.  Even with 2 YKs<br/>
(yes, I got my second one), I can&#39;t approach the damage of my wife&#39;s warrior<br/>
or even the DOTs from the Shamans or druids and I will probably get<br/>
out-damaged by our mages pets.  With my Kisch and Yk or my 2 Yks I can do<br/>
respectable damage now, but it is a smaller percentage of the overall damage<br/>
done in a battle and nothing near what a warrior with the same combo of<br/>
weapons could do.  Given that, the only valid argument that I&#39;ve heard about<br/>
using proc&#39;ing weapons vs. non-proc&#39;ing weapons for a bard is we tend not to<br/>
want the taunt effect of the proc (not having any hit points).  Now if you<br/>
agree with the argument that a high level bard should be using non-proc&#39;ing<br/>
weapons to reduce the taunt effect, then probably the best weapon combo for<br/>
a bard would be a EBW and an Orb of Tishan.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other, love the procs and usually don&#39;t mind having the extra<br/>
taunt effect at this point, so I alternate between a Yk and a Kisch and 2<br/>
Yks.  Besides they look cool :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Who cares about the proc?  Most weapons don&#39;t average<br/>
&gt; &gt; more than 1 proc every 45 seconds or so anyway<br/>
&gt; &gt; (contrary to most people&#39;s belief that they average 4<br/>
&gt; &gt; or 5 procs per fight).  The damage/delay is better<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Depends who you usually group with.  If you&#39;re with casters,<br/>
&gt; then I agree.  But I&#39;m usually in all-melee or primarily melee<br/>
&gt; groups.  With fights typically lasting 3+ minutes, the weapons<br/>
&gt; *do* average 4-5 procs per fight.  :)  (I enjoy grouping with<br/>
&gt; casters too, but long melee fights makes the effect of my<br/>
&gt; songs more obvious so I can fine tune the mix better.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; than the ykesha and ebw (not taking into account magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; numbers and lower delay,etc).  I guess I still don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; see why you guys think it is crappy.  Granted it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; off a dragon and is only marginally better than your<br/>
&gt; &gt; ykesh or ebw.  However, unless you have a planar<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon I would consider this better.  Anyway, anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; on Tunare who think this weapon is crappy--I will<br/>
&gt; &gt; gladly take your crappy weapon!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it looks like a plain old dagger, that makes it crappy in<br/>
&gt; my book.  :)<br/>
