&gt;the game), and could run faster then others...that got me to start playing <br/>
&gt;the Bard, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard <br/>
&gt;class is so flexible once you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>

&gt;So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>

<br/>
A bard is unique. Nobody else can do all the things a bard can possibly do.<br/>
<br/>
A bard is elite. Only someone who has studied and practiced can perform the <br/>
rudimentary tasks it takes to be a bard, let alone the higher techniques. <br/>
I&#39;ve never met a punk who played a bard.<br/>
<br/>
A bard has choices. There is no &quot;sing just this combination to win&quot;. Each <br/>
situation presents different song possibilities along with instrument options.<br/>
<br/>
A bard is swift. Usually. :-) Guess I&#39;ll be begging for SOWs for a while.<br/>
<br/>
A bard is romantic. A jug of wine, a loaf of bread and thou.<br/>
<br/>
A bard helps others. Besides being beneficial in a group, there&#39;s nobody <br/>
better at Search and Rescue especially in the outdoors. I&#39;ve found and <br/>
recovered corpses for all sorts of people in some dicey places. Not much is <br/>
more rewarding.<br/>
