<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570129829">So there I am, camping the lil Sarnak tower near the Frontier Mtns zone in<br/>
Ill Omen.  About an hour and a half after I had arrived, I happened to spot<br/>
this single Sarnak recruit *walking* (the emphasis will be explained in a<br/>
sec) up to the base of the tower, and heading up the hill.  This was not too<br/>
terribly long after a Sarnak train had passed by the same spot.<br/>
<br/>
    Well, there I am, there is this strolling Sarnak... I&#39;m *hunting*<br/>
Sarnaks... what luck, eh?  As i begin fighitng this lil bit of scrumptious<br/>
exp, some lugnut named Synd comes up and tells me to pull my own spawns,<br/>
then turns around and scurried off.<br/>
    ???<br/>
    As soon as I got done with the next Sarnak (the one that jumped me after<br/>
the one I supposedly stole), I told him that the critter was walking,<br/>
therefore seemed to be un-engaged, and I had no way of knowing that anyone<br/>
had pulled it.  (If I had known, I certainly wouldn&#39;t have even bothered<br/>
casting on it, I can find my own stuff to kill :oP )  He then proceeds to<br/>
curse at me (which I reported... heeheehee) then tossed the big stunner at<br/>
me: &quot;You are an infamous KSr.&quot;  I thought I was gonna hurt myself laughing!<br/>
I told him that a bard KS&#39;r was just tooo funnny.  he then began telling me<br/>
how his roomate has a level 51 bard, and we can use the charm song to KS,<br/>
and there&#39;s a proc bug, yadda, yadda, yadda, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
    I guess it didn;t matter that if I hadn;t broken the spawn, he wouldn;t<br/>
have been able to pull in the first place, or that if his critter wasn&#39;t<br/>
acting in an engaged-type manner (actually, it looked like it was just<br/>
returning from that earlier train), then it&#39;s hardly fair to say that<br/>
someone &quot;stole&quot; it from you.<br/>
<br/>
    I told him that the charm, to my knowledge, has never been able to wipe<br/>
the hate list.  I didn&#39;t bother to remind him that exp awarded isn&#39;t based<br/>
on hate list anymore, but on damage done.  His arguementative response was<br/>
something along the lines of &quot;you should know more about the class you<br/>
play&quot;... Hmmm... can&#39;t be much of a KSr if I don&#39;t know diddly about my<br/>
class, now can I?<br/>
<br/>
    I just thought the rest of you would get a real kick out of knowing that<br/>
bards (at least in some folks&#39; eyes) are the &quot;best KSrs in the game&quot;.  Class<br/>
envy, gotta love it.<br/>
