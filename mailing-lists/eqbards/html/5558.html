<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315997929">This adventure took place as the E&#39;ci incarnation of Athren.  While<br/>
exploring the pre-first floor of Befallen (and wondering why I couldn&#39;t<br/>
open that door in the back corner), I happened across a hole in the floor<br/>
that looked oddly like a dried-up well.  While admiring it&#39;s lack of<br/>
craftsmanship, a brave soldier marched past me and stepped into the abyss<br/>
without hesitation.  So I think to myself, if he can do it, I can do it.<br/>
<br/>
One extremely long step later found me nowhere good.  Wandering the<br/>
immediate vicinity revealed three small groups of significantly higher<br/>
levels standing around doing nothing.  I didn&#39;t quite understand what was<br/>
going on, so meandered off to explore.  Hey look, this wall behind the<br/>
chair isn&#39;t really there.  Necro?  Isn&#39;t that a PC class?  Where&#39;d all<br/>
these skeletons come from?  Are you casting spells on me?  How did<br/>
Freeport end up in Befallen?<br/>
<br/>
The wife of a friend of a friend in the Amber Order was kind enough to<br/>
pull together a rescue party (two 30&#39;s monks and a 30&#39;s cleric), and<br/>
escorted me and my stuff back to daylight, but not without a few more<br/>
extremely harrowing experiences (being told to stand still while necros<br/>
and skels are being pulled off you is not the most pleasant of<br/>
experiences, especially when they run and you&#39;re left all alone, hoping<br/>
nothing wanders past..).<br/>
