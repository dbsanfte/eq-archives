<b>Subject:</b> How to improve multiple skills at once <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706050088">The eastern shore in N. Ro is great for multiple skill building.  <br/>
While playing Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre with a Mino horn, and swimming <br/>
along the shore, I did some baking.  Improved my skills in swimming, <br/>
wind instruments, and baking all at once.  A bit hard to imagine <br/>
doing something similar in real life.  :)<br/>
