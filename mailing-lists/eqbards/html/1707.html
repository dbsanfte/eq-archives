<div id="ygrps-yiv-117763868">Maybe if more people would read the posts instead of just rising to defend<br/>
their character we would get a lot more intelligent conversation instead of<br/>
flames!<br/>
<br/>
As I said before all the flames &quot;Whether or not bards can ultimately wear<br/>
plate or not is moot to me, it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard so I won&#39;t&quot;<br/>
was that too difficult for you to understand??? <br/>
<br/>
Not once did I ask that Verant remove this ability, in fact I quite clearly<br/>
stated I don&#39;t care if they remove it or not.  I choose not to wear plate<br/>
because it doesn&#39;t fit my role-playing image of a bard, period.  I also<br/>
agree with the previous post where not one person has given a valid<br/>
role-playing reason for wearing plate as a bard, although I think there are<br/>
some, but those are not the kind of posts we are seeing.  Instead we see<br/>
more, &quot;Oh yeah but...&quot; type of posts.  <br/>
<br/>
Heaven forbid someone should make your character weaker in order to further<br/>
atmosphere or enhance the storyline.  In fact if all characters could do<br/>
everything we&#39;d all be perfectly balanced, and perfectly boring.  Flame<br/>
away, since apparently it is all some of you are capable of.<br/>

     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>
        and each to his seperate star...&quot;</div>
