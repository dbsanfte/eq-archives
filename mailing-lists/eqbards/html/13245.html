<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601394401">Beatdrop - I posted the message detailing the pathing.  I also made it quite<br/>
clear that I do not condone using the exploitative aspects of that pathing.<br/>
If knowledge frightens you, or you feel that you don&#39;t have the<br/>
self-restraint to keep from misusing your knowledge that&#39;s your problem.<br/>
Having a gun doesn&#39;t mean you have to fire it.<br/>
<br/>
So am I hearing that the GMs on Karana feel that merely standing on the<br/>
stairs to allow a mob to come to you (which is standard mob behavior<br/>
elsewhere in Norrath) is an exploit?  Damn.  I would have thought that doing<br/>
so was merely a player&#39;s way of coping with an obvious pathing bug.  Now<br/>
jumping off the stairs to freeze the mobs, yes..  that&#39;s an exploit.  I&#39;ll<br/>
contact our Guides on Fennin Ro tonight and see what they say.<br/>

&gt; Ewwww.  Yuck yuck yuck.  A trusted friend and a trusted<br/>
&gt; guildmember and friend at odds about what went on.  Please<br/>
&gt; leave me out of it.  I wasn&#39;t there when it happened, so don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make me take sides.  All I can do is reiterate my position<br/>
&gt; that I will not exploit bugs like this, except to test them so<br/>
&gt; I can send in an accurate bug report.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh, let&#39;s be a little more exact in your re-telling please. An OOC<br/>
&gt; &gt; comment was made as follows: &quot;I never thought I&#39;d read about a exploit<br/>
&gt; &gt; on eqbards and see it being used in-game by a bard on that list&quot;. Three<br/>
&gt; &gt; members of your group replied they were not using any exploit, but you<br/>
&gt; &gt; were, since I am familiar with the exploit, and you WERE using it. How<br/>
&gt; &gt; do I know? I made the OOC comment, I was on another character. I never<br/>
&gt; &gt; sent you any tell, and never said you would be banned, as that is not in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my power to do so. A member of your party commented &quot;exploits are part<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the game&quot; to which I replied &quot;and it is a part of the game, that when<br/>
&gt; &gt; used, is bannable without warning&quot;. This has been stated by Karana&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; GM-Lead (Mennix) over server broadcast before, you may ask him how he<br/>
&gt; &gt; feels about people using the cazic temple pathing exploit to verify this<br/>
&gt; &gt; should you feel like it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t want you to feel you didn&#39;t have a face for your accuser,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is me. I don&#39;t know whether you read this list before using the<br/>
&gt; &gt; exploit at the Cazic temple or not, it doesn&#39;t change the fact your<br/>
&gt; &gt; group was using the exploit, and had been doing so for quite awhile<br/>
&gt; &gt; before I commented on it. Had you truely been naive to what you were<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing, I suspect any ooc comment from your group would have been along<br/>
&gt; &gt; the lines of &quot;where?&quot; not &quot;no we aren&#39;t!&quot; as was the case with groups in<br/>
&gt; &gt; other areas of the dungeon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To paraphrase John Kim, he said, &quot;some people view the pathing bug<br/>
&gt; &gt; (exploit) as an annoyance, others as an opportunity. Obviously I will<br/>
&gt; &gt; never agree with you on this issue, since I view bugs and exploits<br/>
&gt; &gt; abusing them as an annoyance, while you view them as a opportunity.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry about responding so late to this, I just got caught up on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; list.  All this weekend I was hunting in Cazic and one night 4 of us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were doing the Temple.  There was a group at the top and one on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; outer area so we stayed on the first rung of the temple and were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pulling when we noticed this bug.  Mind you, I hadn&#39;t read the list<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet, so I didn&#39;t hear about this exploit.  One pull, we had two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lizards and one started to run when we had it to the sliver, so he was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; heading down the last flight of steps where we killed him.  The other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; group watched us fighting there on the steps for this pull and after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fight I get a /tell from one of the members suggesting that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t use that exploit.  WTF?  What exploit?   He wouldn&#39;t tell me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I slightly forgot about it.  Then while our ranger kept trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pull and couldn&#39;t get the lizzies to follow him, I decided to try a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; charm pull, which did make it so I can pull the lizards.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A few minutes later on OOC, the same guy that had sent me the /tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and one of his guildmembers, were basically accusing me of exploiting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; telling me I was gonna get banned, all because of the fact that I am a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bard and the exploit was posted on this list... which he said later on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in OOC.  I tried to explain what I was and wasn&#39;t doing but they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t listen.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As a side note, I don&#39;t feel that this list is appropriate for posting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; exploits.  I don&#39;t want to know about them nor do I want to use them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because it was posted here, a few people were accusing me just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because I was a bard fighting in the area of the exploit.  So please,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t mind the spoilers, but I am sure other people on the list<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; including myself don&#39;t want to hear about exploits.<br/>
