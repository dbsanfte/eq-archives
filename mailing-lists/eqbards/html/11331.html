&gt; &gt;Absolutely wonderful =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;But - um.. what does the second-to-last stanza refer to?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very sad to say I had the horrid luck to see<br/>
&gt; Upon the plain, through fog and rain, The Thing That Must Not Be.<br/>
&gt; To show their ire, the gods rained fire, and both of us were charred...<br/>
&gt; Apparently the gods could see the Thing but not the bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmmm on rereading it this morning it seems less clear than it did at 1am<br/>
&gt; last night. = P  Basically, the point of this stanza was to show how bards<br/>
&gt; can be stricken by the wrath of the gods because they were standing too<br/>
near<br/>
&gt; the gods&#39; actual target.  I&#39;ll look for a way to make this more clear.<br/>

Basically what he means is, we get nerf&#39;d so often cause Verant is targeting<br/>
some exploit or other class and since our skills cover such a wide range of<br/>
things we get pop&#39;d with &quot;the wrath of gods&quot; and get nerf&#39;d.  In essance,<br/>
Verant sees the problem but doesn&#39;t see that it will affect bards :(  Pretty<br/>
eloquent I&#39;d say GG.<br/>
