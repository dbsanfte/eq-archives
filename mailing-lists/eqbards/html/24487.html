I would highly recommend that after charm, the next song should be Selo&#39;s Accelerando, and then if you have time. Then if charm is still holding, you can sing another song like Hymn of Restoration.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our Lugubrious Lament only lower&#39;s the aggro range of the creature, like any other lull spell. Using a string instrument will help make the aggro range even smaller. Just remember that the aggro range is never completely eliminated. For instance, say you have 2 mobs with one in the front and one in the back. If you lament in the one in the front it&#39;s aggro range is now very small. If you pull the mob in back and it runs through the front creature&#39;s small aggro range, then they will both come.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, it would be better to either Lament the creature in back and pull the front one.<br/>
