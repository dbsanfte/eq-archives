<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915749158"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;d LOVE to have an undead version of this song for places like Lower Guk.<br/>
&gt; It would sure as heck make life easier.  As it is now, we all carry around 2<br/>
&gt; or 3 shaman potions in case Invisi to undead starts to drop early....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ok besides Taneran, who likes to play with Gnolls, I think the undead<br/>
  component should be added to our existing invis, and let a brand new<br/>
  song be introduced in our lineup.  Force Verant to actually do some<br/>
  work and give us a song we can actually use all the time (instead<br/>
  of one that works in Lguk and Kith, heh)<br/>
<br/>
  It kills me, that some people on this list stood up for Verant about<br/>
  our missing songs.  They are just not released!  They&#39;ll be here in<br/>
  the expansion!  They know exactly what they are!  <br/>
<br/>
  Yeah right, heh.  Keep dreaming.  They forgot about us.  And they<br/>
  just don&#39;t really care anymore.  Everyone&#39;s a druid or a necro.<br/>
  They&#39;ve shifted focus to the classes that actually make up over<br/>
  95% of the game.  With any minority, being overlooked is purely<br/>
  commonplace.<br/>
  <br/>
  I just know they are gonna drop the ball.  And I watch some of<br/>
  those people who praised Verant, now turn against them.  It&#39;s<br/>
  the power of the Dark Side.  I love the game, I hate Verant.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s a love/hate relationship as someone wrote on a webpage.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
