<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505353691"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;wouldn&#39;t bother complaining about it though, or they&#39;d probably replace<br/>
&gt;it with a new find true north song. Then they&#39;d probably fill in the<br/>
&gt;missing songs with find true east, find true west and find true south.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Note that the spell they replaced with True North, Sense Magic, is a<br/>
lvl 1, MAYBE lvl 4/5 spell. It did NOTHING before. Now, if you are<br/>
young, it will be a useful spell. Sure, you don&#39;t want it if you are<br/>
now lvl 49 (except to train that skill perhaps) But how many<br/>
people still use Flame Lick at lvl 49 either?<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant really did improve Sense Magic, for the levels that<br/>
spell is put in at. I work to max Sense Heading first thing when I<br/>
create a new character. 1) it takes forever. Only in lvl 8, when<br/>
I had to travel across the continent and used SEnse Heading every<br/>
time it came up, did my bard FINALLY max Sense Heading. And even<br/>
maxxed, its not very consistent yet. At levels 1-4, your MAX<br/>
Sense heading, after all, is 10-25... And sometimes it can be useful to<br/>
know. Just because you stay in your newbie area at that time does not mean<br/>
that everyone is.<br/>
