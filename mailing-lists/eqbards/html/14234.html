<div id="ygrps-yiv-998215547">Its so sad.  I am a half-elf bard on E&#39;ci who started in Qeynos and spent<br/>
the first 8 levels between Quenos and Blackburrow, a lot of time in<br/>
BlackBurrow.  Not only do these pictures bring back bittersweet memories of<br/>
my younger years, I remember when Lullabye was useful too.  I also remember<br/>
when they changed it so that it would only affect at most 4 mobs instead of<br/>
as many as were in the song radius.  Ahhh the good old days.<br/>

&gt;   I was roaming around the net and I found these old pictures Sylly<br/>
&gt;   took.  I have some of my own, but these show the outside <br/>
&gt; perspective.<br/>

&gt;   I think I was L19 in these pictures.  Full bronze which I worked<br/>
&gt;   my ass of for from the first wave of L50s on Innoruuk.  This is<br/>
&gt;   when a bronze bp would run about 75-100pp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I put over 20 gnolls to sleep, ranging from scrawny to elite.<br/>
&gt;   I lost maybe 2 or 3 bubbles of health for the 2 or 3 mins I stood<br/>
&gt;   there holding them still.  That&#39;s right, completely still.  Hardly<br/>
&gt;   anything attacked me, they stayed asleep until I stopped playing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   This is how it used to be.  Verant (and GZ) blatantly lied that<br/>
&gt;   they haven&#39;t adjusted this song since release.  I tried to sleep<br/>
&gt;   off a few skeletons yesterday and I could not keep the group <br/>
&gt;   controlled at all.  The programmers didn&#39;t just put in the failed<br/>
&gt;   to mesmerize message, about 4 or 5 months ago they definitely F&#39;d<br/>
&gt;   this song.<br/>
