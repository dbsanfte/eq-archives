<b>Subject:</b> Re: Dual wield tips and tricks, got any? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351588902">Well, YMMV - but this is what *I* did - and maxed out both piercing (from<br/>
0) and dual within lvl 17. Not terribly fast, but if you can put off the<br/>
&#39;need to level quickly&#39; that so many fall prey to, it does work.<br/>
<br/>
I went to the generic bandit camp in lesser fay with friends. Why with<br/>
friends?  Well, as piercing and dual were 0 - I knew I couldn&#39;t really kill<br/>
anything so I found a couple folks that could kill them and still make good<br/>
xp off them. All I did was equip two daggers and wailed on the backs of<br/>
bandits someone else was fighting. I didn&#39;t do enough damage to even think<br/>
about taking the kill - but both skills shot up VERY quickly.<br/>
<br/>
At 17 - I still made skillgain off them (they have great loot too - but I<br/>
let others have that).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this would work with any other level appropriate mob.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been much more concerned with keeping my skills up - than<br/>
leveling. <br/>

&gt;I have finally made level 17 and got my dual wield.  Does anyone have<br/>
&gt;suggestions on how to raise the ability quickly?  . . . besides dumping<br/>
&gt;points in to it.  Possibly putting the fastest weapon in my second hand? </span></blockquote></div>
