&gt;Perhaps if it gets high enough, you get the increased stats without the<br/>
&gt;side effects - but still - is this just something that the dev team got a<br/>

I&#39;ve heard it helps raise regen rates as well but I&#39;ve yet to notice that.<br/>

   The other thing I&#39;ve suggested was to have bard songs actually have a<br/>
slightly better effect when drinking.  Instead of say +19 str, +22 str or<br/>
whatever.  Nothing major but more to make it fun.<br/>
