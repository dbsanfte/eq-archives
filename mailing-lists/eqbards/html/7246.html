 </span></blockquote>I thought Radia paid 9000 pp for it, or was it 10000?  By the way, Radia is <br/>
not a twink, she made all her fortune via trading/buying/selling.  Last I <br/>
know she wasn&#39;t even in a guild.  So it is possible for a non-guild twinked <br/>
character to get all those nice equipments at that level.</div>
