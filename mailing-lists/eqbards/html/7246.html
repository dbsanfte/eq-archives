<div id="ygrps-yiv-632740293"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;8)Another note on the sash, while the test posted showed it with a L27<br/>
&gt;8)bard, you can forget getting one until you can take a tough group of<br/>
&gt;8)L45+ players into lower guk, unless your guild is very pro-twinking.<br/>

&gt;	Or you&#39;re willing to pay some 10,000 plat for one. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought Radia paid 9000 pp for it, or was it 10000?  By the way, Radia is <br/>
not a twink, she made all her fortune via trading/buying/selling.  Last I <br/>
know she wasn&#39;t even in a guild.  So it is possible for a non-guild twinked <br/>
character to get all those nice equipments at that level.</div>
