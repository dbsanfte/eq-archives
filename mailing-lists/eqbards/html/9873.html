<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869506107"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The general consensus for what i have heard (this is all 2nd hand, so <br/>
&gt;please<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t attack me if you disagree) is that the Berserker Strength effect on <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;PGT becomes a detriment in the mid-high 20&#39;s when mobs start rolling over <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;sheild.  Essentially, the -20[?] agility becomes something like a free hit <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;the mob fighting you {especially if it drops you below an agility<br/>
&gt;Breakpoint..my agility is 93, so the proc would drop me below 75, which <br/>
&gt;means<br/>
&gt;that i personally would lose over 30 pts of AC...that is BAD}.  And, even <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;this is exaggerated, it really is a poor weapon (based on dmg, Delay and<br/>
&gt;weight). I would definitely be using the BLW and the Silvery War Axe (or <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;dirk and war axe).  Of course, you are high enough to go get yourself Demon<br/>
&gt;Claws, which seem pretty spiffy to me.  or that fancy SharkJaw Cutlass in <br/>
&gt;Kedge<br/>
&gt;Keep...in a group w/higher lvls than you.  (should be easy to assemble a <br/>
&gt;mid<br/>
&gt;40&#39;s kedge group that will let you in for the mana song alone....)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;bottom line, at 35 i would not be using a pgt.  In fact i was offered one <br/>
&gt;at 23<br/>
&gt;for a reasonable price, but i turned it down because from what i have <br/>
&gt;heard, it<br/>
&gt;will only be really good for me for a few (3 to 4) levels.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a PGT now, along with a dirk.  I&#39;m level 25, and I&#39;ve had it for ... <br/>
umm... 6? levels.. (can&#39;t remember exactly when I got it).  While its true <br/>
at higher levels the PGT becomes more of a hindrance than a help, at this <br/>
point for me, its still a help.  I&#39;ll be upgrading it at some point, but its <br/>
not a priority for me right now.  Lambent armor is :)<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me what the worth of a Staff of Writhing on Povar is? I&#39;d <br/>
love to upgrade to that, if I get the chance.<br/>
