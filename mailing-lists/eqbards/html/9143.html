<b>Subject:</b> Some questions about Experience (off-topic) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-392621261">The highest person in the group was 34th level.  I&#39;m 25th level. We were<br/>
fighting deathly ushers/ heralds, dark ritualists/offerers.  All were deep red<br/>
to me.  Not certain what they conned to the 34th level person.  We were in the<br/>
secret room with four doors right next to the graveyard.  At 25th level, no way<br/>
am I going any further into the castle.  So heres the original question worded a<br/>
little different:<br/>
<br/>
Based on the type of mobs listed above, what is the highest level character I<br/>
should group with in order to get experience similar to that from fighting the<br/>
yard trash with other characters my level?     <br/>
<br/>
Galtin of E&#39;ci (whose brain is starting to hurt and should just play the game<br/>
for fun instead of worrying about experience but who also wants to gain some<br/>
levels fast so he can go into Solusek to get the bard quest components)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; In other words, does grouping with higher level characters fighting mobs that<br/>
&gt; con red to you equal (or come close to equalling) grouping withequal level<br/>
&gt; characters fighting mobs that con blue to you?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The way JM described it, the fraction of the experience for a<br/>
&gt; kill that you get is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  your total experience<br/>
&gt; ------------------------<br/>
&gt; party&#39;s total experience<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So you should get good experience provided you kill things<br/>
&gt; that are reasonably difficult for the average level of the<br/>
&gt; party.  If you kill stuff blue to the lowest level person,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;ll be very slow.<br/>
