<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250374569">One thing to keep in mind... EQ plat has no value in and of itself.  Banks<br/>
do not pay interest.  There is no provision in the economy for capital<br/>
investment.  Money is just a store of value or meduim of exchange.  500pp in<br/>
the bank is worthless.  A pair of Elf Hide Gloves has true value - stats &<br/>
prestige.  The person who paid 375pp for them obvious felt that they were<br/>
worth it compared to having 375pp in the bank doing nothing.  <br/>
<br/>
Granted - he may have a hard time getting 375pp back out of them but if he<br/>
wanted them that bad - he probably wont even think of getting rid of them.<br/>
As you get older, your access to plats gets easier, your stuffs get better.<br/>
So now you have most everything you want to wear and you have 800pp in the<br/>
bank rotting away - now when you see something you want - you can pretty<br/>
much have it.<br/>
<br/>
What drives most deals (sales) of items is how bad the buyer wants something<br/>
and the convenience of getting it.  I have been on both sides of pretty many<br/>
deals.  <br/>
<br/>
Here we are in the Oasis d&#39; Mar<br/>
/auction Polar Bear Cloak AC8 +10HP +20svCold great for casters anyone can<br/>
wear 40pp obo<br/>
<br/>
/ooc that&#39;s a rip they cost only 5pp <br/>
<br/>
/ooc yes but first travel to everfrost - get polar bear skin - hire a ranger<br/>
- 4 hours to find karg - then he gets killed for his GZ - 4 more hours to<br/>
find karg - 5pp to karg and travel back home<br/>
<br/>

		Someone really got taken then. On my server they go for 40pp<br/>
to 75pp tops.<br/>

around the same<br/>
