<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470007636">Okay, first off, let me apologize for calling your idea silly.<br/>
<br/>
Look at it this way though.  We get a different song every level.  Sure, not<br/>
all of them are useful, but at least every song is different.  We have 50<br/>
songs (or will if they ever get around to adding the missing 4 or so) and<br/>
there is almost no overlap.  Each song has a pretty unique effect such that<br/>
I am still finding a use for my level 1 and 2 songs at level 41.  Many of<br/>
our songs become more powerful as we level, making low level songs still<br/>
very viable at very high levels.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, look at casters.  They get maybe 8 to 12 spells every four<br/>
levels (assuming the &quot;pure&quot; casting classes).  However, every 4 to 8 levels<br/>
many of their spells are replaced with more powerful versions of previous<br/>
ones.  This actually leaves for very little variety.  You won&#39;t find a level<br/>
50 mage still using a level 4 pet.  That spell has become useless.<br/>
Comparing us to casters by saying they get a couple pages of spells every<br/>
few levels doesn&#39;t seem reasonable when you consider how many of their<br/>
spells are rendered completely useless by a more powerful version.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I didn&#39;t like your idea, but I meant no offence.  Its like a<br/>
mage saying all their pet spells should be replaced with more useful things,<br/>
and just make their low level pet get more powerful with levels.  <br/>
<br/>
When you look at it this way, I don&#39;t really see how casters have more<br/>
spells to chose from than we do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you wish to nitpick, then you are correct. We&#39;re<br/>
not casters. But we have the equivilant of spells<br/>
in our songs. We get *one* &#39;mystical power&#39; per level<br/>
whereas other characters get *multiple* &#39;mystical<br/>
powers&#39; per level. These &#39;mystical powers&#39; are the<br/>
backbone of our class just as they are the backbone<br/>
of the other classes. <br/>
<br/>
Does that fit your requirements a bit better? The<br/>
comparison isn&#39;t silly at all. We only get one<br/>
song per level. It would be nice to have that only<br/>
song be worthwhile. The poster I replied to was<br/>
comparing a caster having a useless &#39;power&#39; to our<br/>
having a useless &#39;power&#39;. I was pointing out that<br/>
when we have a single useless &#39;power&#39; it&#39;s not the<br/>
same as a caster since they get more of these to<br/>
choose from than we do.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing silly in that.</div>
