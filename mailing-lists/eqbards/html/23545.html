your guild&#39;s loot system rules, which should be fair. I don&#39;t think that <br/>
this is a &quot;general attitude of guilds&quot; towards bards and I&#39;ve never seen <br/>
such an attitude. If you are in a guild who discriminates against a class <br/>
in such a way, you are in with a bunch of selfish juveniles who only look <br/>
after themselves and their close friends and not with someone who cares <br/>
about all their fellow guildmates as a partner-in-arms.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, the guild I&#39;m in is lead by a bard who is fair and pretty strict. But <br/>
the rules she enforces are bound with honor, integrity and fairness.<br/>

It&#39;s hard when you want something that requires help. I wouldn&#39;t totally <br/>
bash a guild for not immediately coming to one&#39;s aid though. One of my <br/>
guildmates got angry that nobody would help him camp the Ancient Cyclops <br/>
for jboots in Southern Ro when he asked for people in guild chat. It&#39;s can <br/>
be a long boring camp to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
We have a message board and for the most part, if he had organized this <br/>
ahead of time and asked for assistance, people would&#39;ve help. But trying to <br/>
organize a spontaneous group can sometimes be hard.<br/>
<br/>
If I had the time I&#39;d be on every type of raid imaginable and want to help <br/>
out all my guildmates. Alas, I might be able to clear my schedule once in <br/>
my life to be able to participate in a raid someday, but even that isn&#39;t <br/>
very likely.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to get help from other guildmates is to be helping them with <br/>
their quests first. It&#39;s harder for one to refuse to help someone when they <br/>
have helped you in the past and such selfless action is always a reward <br/>
unto itself.<br/>
