&gt;Nafai has written up a very nice petition about a lot of the bards&#39;<br/>
&gt;problems in the game.  The petition is in the format of a topic and a<br/>
&gt;chance for you to agree/disagree with that particular topic.  I<br/>
&gt;encourage all bards to read it and give feedback.<br/>
&gt;This is the adress<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is our chance if we want something done about our class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just submitted my take on the petition.  I highly recommend that every<br/>
bard here do so as well, and push on any other bards that may not be here.<br/>
The petition is nicely done.  The issues and suggestions are good ones.<br/>
<br/>
As a chorus we sing louder than solo.  This may be a way to get through to<br/>
the unresponsive ears in Verant.<br/>
