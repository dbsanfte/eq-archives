<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216606734">Actually I think Selos root breaking effect does work in dungeons. I have <br/>
ben camping out in Befallen&#39;s basement alot lately with my guildmates, <br/>
mostly big Barb warriors who covet the BBC&#39;s and we get rooted all the time. <br/>
I have tried it each time and it seems to unstick you or your group members <br/>
before you get that pesky&#39;you can&#39;t do that in here&#39; message. It is hard to <br/>
tell in the heat of a battle but now they will say ROOTED and when I hit <br/>
selos we can move again.<br/>
<br/>
As to jig and being a mini-mana bard, we found this in beta and I am the <br/>
darling of the casters my level for it once they figure it out.<br/>
For hotbuttons, definitely add assist. You need to get used to the whole <br/>
group concentrating on one mob at a time and assist is the best way. <br/>
Essential for higherlevel dungeon hunting IMHO. I quit trying sense heading <br/>
since it always let me down when I had to know what direction NOW. For 3 pp <br/>
you can buy a compass and put it in your inventory hotkey. It never fails. <br/>
;)<br/>
Here&#39;s hoping my bard has been restored on Xegony.<br/>
Brilinnia, currently ghost bard<br/>
