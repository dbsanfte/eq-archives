<div id="ygrps-yiv-9330781">I used the disenchant song last night to remove the<br/>
resurrect effect from a party member.  He said it<br/>
worked great.  Going to try it on myself next time<br/>
(which I hope is a long way away).<br/>

&gt; My thought was that ADM would prevent weapons from<br/>
&gt; proc&#39;ing on your group<br/>
&gt; members when sung.  The song references that I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; found on the &#39;net say that<br/>
&gt; ADM &quot;cancels magic&quot;, etc., but no one has been able<br/>
&gt; to prove that it actually<br/>
&gt; does such.  Since GZ has said that very few of our<br/>
&gt; songs are left unfinished<br/>
&gt; (and I would expect those to be higher level ones),<br/>
&gt; I was trying to come up<br/>
&gt; with a reasonable untested use for a song with the<br/>
&gt; title &quot;Disenchanting&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe it un-Charms other group members?<br/>
