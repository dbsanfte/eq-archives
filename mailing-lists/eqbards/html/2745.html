&gt;When I listed the Bard quests I knew about (before this latest patch), I<br/>
&gt;neglected to mention one which is a mystery to me...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you talk to the fellow in the Bard&#39;s Guild in Qeynos that&#39;s carrying a<br/>
&gt;flute he&#39;ll mention how the &quot;collect-the-watch-reports&quot; guy made it for<br/>
&gt;him, cuz his father was a master flute craftsman. Now, if you talk to the<br/>
&gt;dude outside (watch reports guys) and spend about half an hour trying a<br/>
&gt;perplexing array of confusing grammar and hesitant and vague replies you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;find out that this guy has stopped making magical flutes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I got no more out of him, no matter what I tried (about another half an<br/>
&gt;hour).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone gotten further?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s frustrating that there&#39;s this inconsistency in the way quests work -<br/>
&gt;you sometimes have to hit them with phrases that aren&#39;t in []&#39;s. Not to<br/>
&gt;mention the typos, irrelevant gender-specific replies and the lack of<br/>
&gt;versatility. I don&#39;t mean to go off on a rant here... so I&#39;ll just hush up<br/>
&gt;now ;)<br/>

&gt;P.S. Any juicy loot from these new FedEx quests?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In beta there was a broken flute quest that involved that same guy. As well <br/>
as a horn quest too.  The FedEx quest are not bad, I did the <br/>
Qeynos-Highhold-Freeport run on the test server and made 5 to 14 gold per <br/>
delivery.  Nice stuff for a 5th level bard :)<br/>
