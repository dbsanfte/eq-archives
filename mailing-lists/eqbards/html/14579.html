  Played around in Sky this last weekend.  No server has done the Noble<br/>
  on Sword (Windmill) Island since the latest patch.  Looks like<br/>
  Verant doesn&#39;t want players to go much further in the Plane.<br/>
  Basically, once you kill the fairies and princess, you&#39;re done<br/>
  unless you want to die a whole bunch.<br/>
<br/>
  Also went to Hate this past weekend too.  Only group to break that<br/>
  post patch on Innoruuk.  We cleared the path to Maestro, which is<br/>
  about 6 houses or so and the south patrol, however a bugged spite golem<br/>
  prevented further advancement.  Apparently this golem had it&#39;s pet<br/>
  trapped in the NE corner.  The golem also blocked the path to clear<br/>
  anymore, and when pulled it we got 15 mobs.  I played fear and counted<br/>
  the Screech messages just to see how many were there.  All resisted fear<br/>
  too, 15 of them.  In the 6 hours we were there, one WAR arms dropped.<br/>
  That is unacceptible.  But I expected as much from Verant.  The planes<br/>
  and dragons are a big deathtrap now due to bugs and impossible upgrades.<br/>
