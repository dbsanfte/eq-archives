<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887337070">Well i topped off my bad looks yesterday...  I&#39;m a wood elf with:<br/>
<br/>
ss helm<br/>
ss gloves<br/>
ss boots<br/>
hero bracer ... Not too bad right? lotsa green.<br/>
<br/>
My other stuff includes:<br/>
lambent bracer<br/>
lambent legs<br/>
lambent arms.. add in the blue<br/>
<br/>
tree weave<br/>
mith bp<br/>
worn cloth mantle<br/>
guise of deceiver<br/>
rune bone fork<br/>
troll hide belt<br/>
2 yaks<br/>
mm drum & nos tamborine<br/>
gypsie princess lute<br/>
<br/>
various jewelry<br/>
<br/>
Well last night i topped off my ugly look by replacing my lambent bracer for<br/>
a Kylong Wrist guard (same stats but more charisma).  THE BRACER IS BROWNISH<br/>
RED!!  i freaked out when i saw it, it keeps overwriting my hero bracer<br/>
look. I never though i could look worse but oh boy when i put that on did i<br/>
ever freak. <br/>
<br/>
While i&#39;m auctioning, some twink bard in full lambent at lev 12 pops up to<br/>
me asks me what i wanted for my hero bracer (im auctioning it because i have<br/>
a spare)  then after a wee bit says oh nm, i thought you were a twink and<br/>
not a real player.  Talk about kicking me while im down.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo anyways, that kicked me in the butt severely and now im really<br/>
determined to powerlevel instead of grouping (which i would much rather do).<br/>
I have to kiss my lambent and tree weave goodbye soon and get some imbrued,<br/>
im tired of looking like all the twinks with various ss and lambent.  Dont<br/>
get me wrong, i have nothing against twinking but man im sick of passing for<br/>
something that is 20-30 levels lower then i really am.<br/>
<br/>
Arg sorry for the rant<br/>
