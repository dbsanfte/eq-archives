<div id="ygrps-yiv-795248412">As in the pat when I feel I&#39;ve hit a brick wall I turn to this list to give me a boost. So here is my new qurey:<br/>
I just made 30th level, Up to now I&#39;ve been singing Anthem & Psalm of Warmth, with Pixie, Charm and Chains thrown in when needed. For down time I play( with lute) Hymn.  I always keep Selos mem&#39;d with Screech for a fast getaway. so there are my 8 song slots. I weild weapons most of the time Kirsh & Obs. Shard in off hand.<br/>
Now I&#39;m 30 I got my first Chant...but last nite I was at a loss as how to weave it into my mix, do I do all instruments? do i sing it as a 3rd or 4th song what song do I drop?  Most of the time I fight in High Keep or Karnuk so AoE aggro is not a problem.<br/>
Please help me :-)<br/>
