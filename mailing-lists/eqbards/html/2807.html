&gt; Which makes me wonder if the Kelethin to Freeport run really works since<br/>
&gt; I did that this morning to no effect.  Of course, I haven&#39;t made up my<br/>
&gt; mind if the problem is this or the fact everytime I&#39;ve zoned from OOT<br/>
&gt; back to Freeport on the boat, my &#39;puter has crashed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Idia, the contact in Kelethin, isn&#39;t identified by surname by Ton (and I<br/>
haven&#39;t been to Kelethin to see for myself). But, Felisity will tell you<br/>
that Lislia Goldtune, a &quot;postmistress&quot;, lives in Highkeep, which suggests<br/>
she knows more about the mail network than just her own agents.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned the apparently bisexual and polygamous &quot;Eve&quot;, whose name<br/>
is dropped by the &quot;postmasters&quot; after a successful delivery. I&#39;ve found no<br/>
sign of Eve, but it sounds like she might be the key to the next step in the<br/>
quest. Whether that step exists yet is another matter.<br/>
