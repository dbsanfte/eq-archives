<div id="ygrps-yiv-221833463">I&#39;ll try this again tonight, but I wasn&#39;t able to chain Charm the pixie<br/>
trickster who foolishly attacked me just as I finished memming the new charm<br/>
song.  Someone on the Concert Hall reported being able to do it, so maybe I<br/>
just had something odd with my connection or something.  I know I won&#39;t be<br/>
able to, but I&#39;m still gonna try charming more than one pet, too (hey, if<br/>
NPC&#39;s can do it...).<br/>
