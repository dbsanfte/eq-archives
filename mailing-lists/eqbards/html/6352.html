<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082426018">Sounds more like packet loss to me, also some zones seem to have always had <br/>
this &#39;feature&#39;. Qeynos Hills comes to mind, as does West Karana.  In WK a <br/>
few days back I was transfromed into a bloody grass stain while attempting <br/>
to pit Choon against Froon, when they both &#39;teleported&#39; on top of me.<br/>

&gt;I just read on Stratics that they have added the code they had on test<br/>
&gt;server that causes mobs who can&#39;t reach you due to pathing problems to<br/>
&gt;be able to teleport to you. However, the article on Stratics said it<br/>
&gt;happened to a party in lower guk, where a group of mobs teleported into<br/>
&gt;a room with one. As our AE songs are likely to set off mobs in other<br/>
&gt;parts of the dungeon more than anything anyone else can do, I was<br/>
&gt;wondering if anyone has seen mobs mysteriously teleport into a fight<br/>
&gt;anywhere yet.<br/>
