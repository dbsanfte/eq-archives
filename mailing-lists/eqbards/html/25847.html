<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971904225">It&#39;s all true.  Before EQ, I was a husk of a man.  Nothing.  I was weak,<br/>
womanless, kicked around by any and everyone who happened to see me.  Dogs<br/>
would cross streets, to pee against my leg.<br/>
<br/>
Then I subscribed to EVERQUEST.  It was their ad, in PC Gamer.  It didn&#39;t<br/>
say, but it promised health, wealth, sex, strength, technical ability, and<br/>
tons of other stuff that I really couldn&#39;t understand, but I could feel it<br/>
assaulting my subconcious awareness.  So I subscribed, and I&#39;ve become a<br/>
powerful warrior bard (well, up until I was nerfed, anyway, dreaded Verant<br/>
the Emasculator), with legions of admiring wood elven nymphs.<br/>
<br/>
My technical brain capacity has swelled, because I constantly reflect, as I<br/>
play, that I&#39;m seeing over four times the high resolution polygons than I<br/>
ever did before.  That everything in EQ almost looks like real life!<br/>
<br/>
Since, as a husk of a man, I can&#39;t afford a computer that comes with a sexy,<br/>
high tech name, I had to give mine a name.  So, I scratched out the &quot;Dell&quot;,<br/>
and named my computer &quot;Firiona Pamela Lee Hawk Arnold Rock<br/>
Doubledataratememory&quot; (and yes, I have a sign ready for when the REAL Pamela<br/>
comes to me, for how could she resist, that reads, &quot;Pamela Lee Firiona<br/>
Hawk...etc).  Hey, it&#39;s hard coming up with a name that reflects all the<br/>
power, virility, athletic prowess, and technical knowhow that has blossomed<br/>
since I started playing EQ.<br/>

Off the topic of Bards, but still of EQ Interest...<br/>
