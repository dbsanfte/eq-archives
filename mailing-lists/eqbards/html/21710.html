Subject: [eqbards] The Mystere Hubbub<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s a potential copyright violation of my own (however I doubt Jason D<br/>
&gt; would mind).  I very interesting post about this topic on the EQ Vault&#39;s<br/>
&gt; board.  BTW - mea culpa (on blaming Verant for banning the wrong - person)<br/>
&gt; evidently - both the rape story and the sacrifice WERE from the same<br/>
&gt; individual (who was banned) according to a post on the Backstage Board<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Slyde<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me start with this. It really frightens me that so many of you have<br/>
&gt; quoted Verant&#39;s EULA as if it were an ABSOLUTE legally binding document,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; that you further defend it as being impenetrable, absolute, and Verant&#39;s<br/>
&gt; vanguard against any letigious action.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I, in real life, actually AM an attorney, one who specializes in civil<br/>
&gt; rights and constitutional law. I&#39;ve also seen more than a few cases<br/>
&gt; revolving around business contract law and licenses, so this is an area I<br/>
&gt; can speak to effectively and knowledgeably. Before I continue, let me tell<br/>
&gt; you Mystere that if I in anyway had the time, I would represent you pro<br/>
bono<br/>
&gt; on this case. However, I am currently far too consumed in other pro bono<br/>
&gt; cases to be able to give your worthwhile cause the attention it would<br/>
&gt; require, though I have passed this on to my firm and my local Bar<br/>
&gt; Association group in case anybody wishes to assist you. I strongly urge<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; on your own to seek counsel on this matter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, let me start. First of all, Verant&#39;s inclusion of a clause saying<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; they can ban or cancel an account for &quot;any reason&quot; is about as legally<br/>
&gt; binding as, well, it&#39;s absolutely NOT legally binding at all. I can&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; compare it to anything because it&#39;s ABSOLUTELY not enforceable. It&#39;s akin<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the &quot;we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.&quot; It&#39;s a scam, a<br/>
hoax,<br/>
&gt; a thin veil that attempts to convince the reader that they have fewer<br/>
rights<br/>
&gt; than they actually posess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This fact is compounded by Verant&#39;s continue modification of the EULA and<br/>
&gt; its forcing of you to click &quot;I agree&quot; everytime you attempt to play the<br/>
&gt; game. It&#39;s tanamount to civil extortion, and I don&#39;t know of a single<br/>
judge<br/>
&gt; that wouldn&#39;t toss the entire EULA out in a civil trial.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me restate this in simple terms. The EULA for EQ is bunk and is merely<br/>
&gt; there so that Verant can protect its intellectual property and to make you<br/>
&gt; think you have no recourse should they violate your rights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now on to the story itself. Did Mystere violate Verant copywrite?<br/>
Probably.<br/>
&gt; Is the violent nature of the story questionable? Possibly. Is there a<br/>
moral<br/>
&gt; question that comes into play because the victim of the story is a minor?<br/>
&gt; Depends on your individual morals. Is the story pornographic? Doubtful. Is<br/>
&gt; it &quot;kiddie porn&quot; ABSOLUTELY NOT.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As someone posted previous to this, fictional stories about fictional<br/>
&gt; characters that do not exist in real life do NOT constitute child<br/>
&gt; pornography....at least, not by federal statute, and not by California law<br/>
&gt; (which is relevent because that&#39;s where Verant is located).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even if it was child pornography, it doesn&#39;t allow Verant to cancel<br/>
&gt; Mystere&#39;s account. For one, Mystere&#39;s posting of this story and her legal<br/>
&gt; contract with Verant are mutually exclusive -- one has absolutely nothing<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; do with the other. For another, it violate&#39;s Mystere&#39;s First Amendment<br/>
&gt; rights. As I said above, Verant probably has a copywrite infringement case<br/>
&gt; against Mystere, but since he in no way attempted to profit from this<br/>
post,<br/>
&gt; Verant would have a difficult time proving civil damages in a civil court.<br/>
&gt; This by the way is Verant&#39;s only real recourse to Mystere&#39;s post --<br/>
bringing<br/>
&gt; her to civil court. In now way does it translate into a right by Verant to<br/>
&gt; severe a business agreement with Mystere, certainly not without<br/>
explanation<br/>
&gt; or warning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At this point, Mystere has two real modes of filing civil suits against<br/>
&gt; Verant. First, as a violation of her civil and constitutional rights.<br/>
&gt; Secondly, as a breach of contract for discontinuing a normal business<br/>
&gt; arrangement with her without cause or explanation in a manner that is both<br/>
&gt; arbitrary and capricious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, Mystere please seek professional legal counsel on this matter.<br/>
