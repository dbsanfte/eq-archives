with a flute, i as a female wood elf bard (very thankfully) do NOT do<br/>
the<br/>
dance.  the people that dance i have seen were half elf males.  as for<br/>
the<br/>
other combinations of bards/races i&#39;m not sure.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Another broken skill to add, female bards do not dance.  I <br/>
&gt; have read on<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;several other bard list that they are very upset by this <br/>
&gt; (atleast some of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;them are).<br/>

&gt; &gt;Female bards don&#39;t dance? Sure we do.  If you mean when playing the<br/>
&gt; flute...<br/>
&gt; &gt;  This is why I have a mino horn, not a flute, because of that silly<br/>
&gt; &gt;marching/dance thingie.<br/>

&gt; Well, I certainly don&#39;t do the dance. I was all excited about <br/>
&gt; it when I got<br/>
&gt; to 16, but to my dismay, I don&#39;t do the dance! :( I even left <br/>
&gt; my computer<br/>
&gt; on, and put my bard in a safe place just so I could max her <br/>
&gt; skill out to see<br/>
&gt; if maybe that was the problem, but it isn&#39;t. Maybe it&#39;s just <br/>
&gt; on some servers<br/>
&gt; that female bards don&#39;t? I&#39;ll ask on my server if this is the case.<br/>
