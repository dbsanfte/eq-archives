<div id="ygrps-yiv-430087651">Doesn&#39;t sound like a mistake to me. Harmony means more than just &quot;a<br/>
succession of chords according to the rules of progression and modulation&quot;.<br/>
It can be applied to literary works, facts and opinions, physics and<br/>
mathematics and, in the case of Monks, body, mind and soul.<br/>
<br/>
And the Cane befits a Monk more than a Bard - just think of Caine (sp?) in<br/>
&#39;Kung Fu&#39;... he used a walking stick of some sorts, didn&#39;t he?<br/>

only Cane of Harmony.  Anyone else think this is a mistake?  I&#39;m<br/>
just thinking perhaps they input another wrong number in the<br/>
database and made this item monk only and not bard only:<br/>
