<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371747747">What is truly scary here is that it took them until  01-25-2000 to walk<br/>
across the office and ask some people who _play_ bards!!!<br/>
<br/>
GZ plays a bard but has his &quot;own&quot; version of the client - now that&#39;s gotta<br/>
give him a really good idea of what&#39;s going on.  And keep your eyes open for<br/>
that ranger with the Soulfire and Ring of Invunerability with a full party<br/>
crawling from room to room in Sol-A.  &quot;Ahh yes, the way it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>
played...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat cynical yes,<br/>

p.s. here&#39;s what happens if you play songs while your puller pulls:<br/>

&gt; After reviewing this thread as well as some others on the other boards,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; chatting with some of our inhouse people that play bards (we have several<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; those), we&#39;ve decided to decrease the taunt factor of the bard songs. </span></blockquote></div>
