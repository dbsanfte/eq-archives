<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181531958"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I get this all the time when I&#39;m at the bank.  The other night I<br/>
&gt;got a tell from a level four bard asking<br/>
&gt;if I could help a poor fellow bard buy their level four song.<br/>
&gt;Remembering how hard the first few levels<br/>
&gt;were, I turned around to take a look.  She was in full bronze!<br/>
&gt;What, her twinker was too cheap to give<br/>
&gt;her 50 plat?  Of course, she was a wood elf, so I had to cough it<br/>
&gt;up.  (See sucker comment, above...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone asks you for money for a song and are in full<br/>
bronze, I&#39;d suggest they sell their armor to get money (esp the<br/>
boots. They are NOT worth the weight!) and then buy a song<br/>
AND a piece of armor more in line with their age. Or perhaps<br/>
fish up some sandals<br/>
<br/>
My level 13 enchanter is still wearing the sandals she fished up on the<br/>
boat ride across from Butcherblock one time.<br/>
<br/>
[And yes, I am twinked. Charred in some places. Bronze in others. PAtchwork<br/>
I made myself and Banded I bought in others. But I have NEVER asked for<br/>
anything. I just find it very difficult to say No because I can see myself<br/>
giving such things away as well..]<br/>
