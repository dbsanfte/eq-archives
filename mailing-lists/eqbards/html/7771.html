  I asked the same question a while back and couldn&#39;t find much solid<br/>
  information.  I&#39;ve yet to find anyone who has experience with playing<br/>
  EverQuest on a laptop.<br/>
<br/>
  As I type this I&#39;m waiting for Dell to call me back so I can order an<br/>
  Inspiron 7500.  As far as I can tell it will run EverQuest pretty well.  I<br/>
  talked to 989 Systems support and was told the ATI Rage Mobility 3D<br/>
  hardware in the Dell is sufficient for EverQuest even though they don&#39;t<br/>
  list it as supported.<br/>
<br/>
  Ultimately I won&#39;t know until I try it.  Dell has a 30-day satisfaction<br/>
  guarantee, so if it doesn&#39;t work I&#39;m not stuck.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ll report back how fast Thrush runs on the Inspiron, probably in a couple<br/>
  weeks.<br/>
