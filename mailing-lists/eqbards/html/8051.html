&gt; Heh well then you have to talk with some 40+ people some more. You have to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I said - you have a basic understanding.  You<br/>
still lack the intimate knowledge it takes to play the class<br/>
well.  I know my cleric friends can heal, and I know they can<br/>
nuke.  I know that sometimes it is better for them to use mana<br/>
to nuke than to heal.  But aside from vague situations (e.g.<br/>
mob that heals itself if you don&#39;t have a nuker), I cannot<br/>
with confidence say when a cleric should nuke and when he<br/>
should heal.  I have little or no idea how much mana these<br/>
spells take, nor do I have their experience of hundreds if not<br/>
thousands of situations where they&#39;ve tried a little bit of<br/>
this or a little bit of that.  Just like I wouldn&#39;t expect my<br/>
cleric friends to know when to switch from buffing, to MR, to<br/>
healing with my songs.  You don&#39;t learn that until you&#39;ve<br/>
played it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That assumes that the same strategies work at all levels.<br/>
While there are several meta-strategies that do work at all<br/>
levels, as a bard you should know that what works and what<br/>
doesn&#39;t changes with each new song you get and each new level<br/>
you gain.  If you&#39;re going to powergame solo to L50 to play<br/>
with your L50 friends, then I&#39;d agree with you.  But if you<br/>
plan to play the early/mid levels with other people, then it&#39;s<br/>
in your and their interest that you learn how to do it well.<br/>
