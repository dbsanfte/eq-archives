<br/>
When the classes get good stuff, we&#39;re a &quot;not-a-&quot; class.  <br/>
Casters get bind, but we&#39;re not-a-caster.  Melee classes get<br/>
parry and riposte, but we&#39;re not-a-melee.  Hybrids got those<br/>
minor resist bonuses, but we&#39;re not-a-hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, when classes get nerfed, we&#39;re a &quot;everything&quot; class.  <br/>
DoT damage gets nerfed, we&#39;re a kiting class.  Monster damage<br/>
gets increased to make life tougher on melee classes, we&#39;re a<br/>
melee class.  etc.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with being a &quot;not-a-&quot; class is that it&#39;s not<br/>
definitive subset.  It changes based on the whim of what the<br/>
speaker wants it to be.  Verant uses it to make good sounding<br/>
excuses to deny us things they give other classes.  You want<br/>
bind?  But you&#39;re not a real casting class.  You want parry?  <br/>
But you&#39;re not a real melee class.  OTOH, if they&#39;d classified<br/>
us as hybrids for example, we would&#39;ve gotten parry and the<br/>
resist bonuses.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and 1 bard class (bard).  Our songs are NOT like the spells of any other <br/>

&gt; weave spells?);<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny you should mention that.  My speculation is that this<br/>
weaving business was completely accidental.  I suspect the<br/>
game works on a 6 second heartbeat, so the shortest possible<br/>
spell/song duration is 6 seconds (this is a MUD-derived game<br/>
after all).  If you start/stop Accel and time its duration,<br/>
it&#39;s always between 12 and 18 seconds.  That&#39;s 2 heartbeats +<br/>
[0 to 1.0 heartbeats depending on when you started the song in<br/>
the initial heartbeat].  So I suspect they made a song system<br/>
which had &quot;instant&quot; on/off effects, then found out that it let<br/>
you weave two songs, and decided it was a neat enough effect<br/>
that they increased some of the durations to make it easier to<br/>
do.  At its inception, I think bard songs were intended to<br/>
only last while the bard was singing them.  They just found it<br/>
impossible to code it that way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; others; and almost every one of our spells improves linearly with the level <br/>
&gt; of the caster.  Plus of course there&#39;s the fact that we only get one spell <br/>
&gt; per level (well, in theory anyways).  Ok, ok, they&#39;re songs, not spells - we <br/>
&gt; differentiate our effects from all other casters&#39;, don&#39;t we?  = )<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s another gripe that I have.  Since we only get one song<br/>
per level, I don&#39;t see why *all* our &quot;spells&quot; don&#39;t improve<br/>
with level.  Specifically, Chain&#39;s slowdown.  I mean here are<br/>
all these high level mobs which are designed to still be<br/>
challenging if an enchanter or shaman tosses a 100% or so<br/>
slowdown, and they won&#39;t improve our slowdown over the initial<br/>
30%?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I still enjoy playing the game.  I just don&#39;t think<br/>
the bard class was implemented very well.  Mind you I would<br/>
never have decided this if I hadn&#39;t gotten the chance to play<br/>
Verant&#39;s implementation.  They didn&#39;t screw up, they tried<br/>
something and IMHO it wasn&#39;t very successful.  I think a good<br/>
way to implement a bard class in a real-time RPG will involve<br/>
different musical skills, phrasing, key, complexity, etc.,<br/>
each having a different magical effect.  The bard can then<br/>
pick and choose, effectively composing on the fly to make<br/>
different combinations of effects.  e.g. Minor key debuffs<br/>
opponent, major key buffs party; brass affects speed, drum<br/>
affects stats, and so on.  As your skill increases, so does<br/>
the complexity of your song and thus the power of the effect<br/>
(including being able to mix together things that are<br/>
typically mutually exclusive like major and minor key).<br/>
<br/>
That and the stupid missed notes, which IMHO are pointless<br/>
with a class that doesn&#39;t have any mana to fizzle.  :)<br/>
