<b>Subject:</b> Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-262346485">Solon&#39;s song of the Sirens has been my prime motivation from near the<br/>
beginning to work my musical ass off.  Can anyone comment on how this song<br/>
works?  I realize that, like most bard songs it has only a 10 - 12 second<br/>
duration, but after it wears off, can you recharm the NPC?  For that matter,<br/>
can you continue to sing at it to ensure that the song&#39;s effects never wear<br/>
off?  We make horrible pvpers, hard to be killed, but even harder to kill<br/>
the attacker.  The best we can do is flee.  Can you charm a PC using this<br/>
song?</div>
