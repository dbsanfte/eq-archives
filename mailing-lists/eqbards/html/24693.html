<br/>
I dueled a 52 monk buddy last night just for kicks.  The first time ended<br/>
with him getting a slightly upper hand and me accidentally hitting the zone<br/>
as I began to kite him  (He had 1/2 hps and I was down to 2 bubs).  That<br/>
particular tactic was to fire up the SS bracer shield, then just let SoS<br/>
run.  He was doing devcent damage, but nothing bad (unless he did a special,<br/>
and that would get through) so I was able to absorb quite a few of his blows<br/>
while he beat himself down on my shield.<br/>
<br/>
After I zoned back, and watched a 51 bard trounce him, I gave it another<br/>
shot, this time leading off with a Cahin, getting a small distance away and<br/>
then firing off a song I thought I would never use... Dirge.   It scared the<br/>
bejeezus outta him when he saw his hps drop by 400+ in one shot *eg*  By the<br/>
end of this fight, he was down to one bub of hp, while I had only lost 1/2 a<br/>
bubble  (level 49 bard vs. level 52 monkey, gotta love it!)<br/>
<br/>
By that time, his SoW had worn off, so I just started running around<br/>
(non-Selos&#39;  lol!) and DoT&#39;ing him until he yeilded, then did the Zone of<br/>
Shame (made the pretty &quot;Barrd won!&quot; spam when he hit the zone ;o)  )<br/>
<br/>
Although it&#39;s a massive drain on us, in a duel, never count out Dirge ;o)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] dueling a druid<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In preparation for this weeks guild event: duelmania, I got silly and dueled<br/>
my wife last night.  She is a 40th lvl druid and I am at 41.<br/>
I was curious about how my songs would work -- here&#39;s what I discovered:<br/>
<br/>
Multiflorious motion dispels root every time.<br/>
Denon&#39;s dissention does work, but not well enough to use in a duel<br/>
(**There is a potential psych factor tho -- maybe combining it with an<br/>
&quot;emote /e drains mana from %T&quot; and /cast &lt;song #&gt; would work...)<br/>
Fear is resisted alot and pixie strike too -- my wife&#39;s MR is 57.<br/>
anti magic aria is a great song<br/>
chains is a great song, in spite of numerous resists (great psych factor)<br/>
Never dismiss the effectiveness of guardian rhythms and a drum<br/>
Bellow is a great song<br/>
punching interrupts casting<br/>
<br/>
Best overall tactic of the night turned out to be:<br/>
<br/>
drums equipped, twist GR, chains and anti-magic aria to debuff (she had 9<br/>
buffs up for each of our 11 duels...)<br/>
(Most druid spells bounce with MR over 120 but DRONES OF DOOM usually landed<br/>
and was difficult to for me to dispel.)<br/>
Once chained, I was able to punch and interrupt spells<br/>
Once damage shields and most buffs are off, druid is also LOM by this time<br/>
Equip weapons and commence to thrash.<br/>
<br/>
 Note<br/>
<br/>
Dispelling DOTs can be a real pain with targeting, singing, retargeting,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend setting up a social key:<br/>
<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/target &lt;yourname&gt;<br/>
/cast &lt;song number&gt;<br/>
/target &lt;opponent&#39;s name&gt;<br/>
The nice thing about this social is your opponent is very quickly retargeted<br/>
so you can immediately resume punching/dismembering them.<br/>
