there with my guild) except this inno spear of course.  but i still have fun<br/>

&gt; Yes, Innoruuk drops it, my guild got one a few nights ago.  <br/>
&gt; It was awarded<br/>
&gt; to another bard with a lot more Planar experience than I <br/>
&gt; have.  He now has<br/>
&gt; the whole set of weapons and Imbrued.  In his words &quot;It took <br/>
&gt; 10 months, but<br/>
&gt; GAME OVER&quot;. </span></blockquote></div>
