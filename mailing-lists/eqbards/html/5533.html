<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053526200">Try Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
In a way I am pretty embarrassed to say so, but I have been in Unrest for<br/>
about a month now, gone from level 20-24 and a half, and earned over 400+<br/>
plat.  I say it is embarrassing because I am not travelling around, but then<br/>
again I have not become bored and have a good time every time I log in.<br/>
<br/>
For me, with my schedule, it is much easier to log in and just play where I<br/>
am rather than spend a lot of my time travelling across Norrath, finding a<br/>
group, getting to know a new area, inevitably dying a few times in the<br/>
process, then going to bed...I save things like that for weekends that I<br/>
decide to dedicate an EQ day or 2 to.  <br/>
<br/>
I only get to play for about 3 or so hours a night about 4 or 5 nights a<br/>
week, and I like to try to keep up with my friends who have a lot more time<br/>
to level than I do.  For this reason Unrest is great for me right now, still<br/>
get good XP, there are still excellent items I am trying to get from there<br/>
(Dwarven Work Boots and Jagged Bands) and it is a small zone, a short run<br/>
from Kaladim, Kelethin, or Freeport.  The XP is great, the loot is great,<br/>
and it is a fun place.  It isn&#39;t for everyone, but for me at level 24 it is.<br/>
I RP a lot and make sure that I enjoy myself, meet new people (I have made<br/>
some great friends there who I group with regularly) and go through the<br/>
tedious leveling business at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
At level 27 after I get charm I think I will head over to Mistmoore and<br/>
spend a month or so there, if I like it enough, but for now, I seem to be<br/>
bound to Unrest.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone got any tips on places for a 17<br/>
&gt; level traveller to go? I&#39;ve tried Upper Guk, but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s just a tad bit too dangerous to solo very<br/>
&gt; far inside. I&#39;ve also tried Befallen and decided<br/>
&gt; that I hate that place and it&#39;s stinky holes in<br/>
&gt; the floor and locked doors you can&#39;t escape from.<br/>
&gt; (I&#39;ve befallen and I can&#39;t get up!) I&#39;ve done<br/>
&gt; Eruds Crossing, been to Kerra Ridge (didnt kill)<br/>
&gt; and lots of other places.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Places that I am currently COMPLETELY bored <br/>
&gt; hunting in:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; North/South Ro<br/>
&gt; Oasis<br/>
&gt; East/West Commons<br/>
&gt; Greater/Lesser Fay<br/>
&gt; Steamfront<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Karana&#39;s probably come to mind, but there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lots of nothing there. And lots of things I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; fight at my level anyway. Bandits are Dervs to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Loot would be nice, experience would be nice - but<br/>
&gt; more than either of those - some place I could <br/>
&gt; explore would be great. I recently went through and<br/>
&gt; completely (?) explored Blackburrow. Everything was<br/>
&gt; green to me (mostly) but it was great fun. I was<br/>
&gt; able to carry enough stuff that I was dragging bags<br/>
&gt; behind me as I left. Not great stuff mind you, but<br/>
&gt; hey - I&#39;m an explorer - a traveller. I don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; to camp for too long.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Veeshan it&#39;s almost impossible to find a group<br/>
&gt; that doesn&#39;t want to just &quot;camp the dervs&quot; or the<br/>
&gt; orcs or &lt;insert mob here&gt;. Travellers are far and<br/>
&gt; few it seems - so if anyone has any suggestions, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; all ears and songs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS: I recently went to King Xorbbs Gorge (Beholder)<br/>
&gt; and loved it. It was new, it was the first time I<br/>
&gt; saw (killed) muddites and I was fairly safe. I of<br/>
&gt; course didn&#39;t explore the whole thing as I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a map - and getting lost in a place called<br/>
&gt; &quot;beholder maze&quot; seemed like an easy thing to do. But<br/>
&gt; at least it wasn&#39;t Orcs, and it wasn&#39;t Dervs. And<br/>
&gt; thank Tunare it wasn&#39;t spiders or scarabs or snakes.<br/>
