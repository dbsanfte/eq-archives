<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106064259">On the early days of this list we had a member - who always seemed to know<br/>
more than he should about EQ.  At first there was some controversy - then we<br/>
found he was a someone who was friends with some of the game designers and<br/>
ultimately did get a job working for Verant - I just saw this on EQ Stratics<br/>

John Capozzi: A Harley Riding Grunt Who Likes to Read<br/>
<br/>
John Capozzi is a Game Designer on the EverQuest Live team. He, along with<br/>
several others, provides content for the game in the forms of quests, text,<br/>
historical background and much more. As he puts it, &quot;I like depth and story,<br/>
I feel they are needed to draw you into the game. Give me a rich world to<br/>
enter, and the tools to let me feel like I&#39;m really there, and I&#39;m a happy<br/>
gamer. Give me a shallow game, no matter how good the gameplay, and I feel<br/>
like I&#39;ve been short-changed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
John grew up moving from place to place, largely in the eastern United<br/>
States, and spent the thirteen years prior to joining the Verant team in the<br/>
Tampa Bay area of Florida, where he was a small business owner. He put four<br/>
years into college (mostly sociology, computer science and literature<br/>
courses), and did five years as what he refers to as a &quot;grunt&quot; and then<br/>
&quot;grunt NCO&quot; in the United States Marine Corps. The latter is what he<br/>
considers his greatest accomplishment - making it through a five-year hitch<br/>
in the Marine Corps with all his original body parts. The Marines, John<br/>
says, were &quot;founded in 1775 in a tavern! The Corps always had its priorities<br/>
straight. ;)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even back in school, John was a gamer, starting out with the pen and paper<br/>
and board games of the time, and moving on to the electronic versions as a<br/>
natural progression. He credits himself for having addicted dozens of other<br/>
high school students to these, simply by demonstrating his own skills. Steve<br/>
Jackson&#39;s Pocket Games, he says, got him suspended from school for a week,<br/>
for that reason. John claims, &quot;Right away, I knew I wanted to wield that<br/>
sort of power over my fellow men.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some of John&#39;s favorite games over the years have been the Civilization<br/>
titles, D&D Gold Box games, System Shock, Thief, Fallout, all the<br/>
Mechwarrior titles, Gemstone, and of course, EverQuest. It&#39;s clear that he<br/>
prefers games that challenge the mind as well as the hand-eye coordination<br/>
skills.<br/>
<br/>
John managed to make some time for other hobbies over the years, including<br/>
working on and riding vintage Harley Davidson motorcycles, and lots of<br/>
reading. Some of his favorite authors are Roger Zelazny, William<br/>
Shakespeare, Larry Niven, George R. R. Martin, Jerry Pournelle, Tom Clancy,<br/>
Ernest Hemingway, Robert A. Heinlein, and last but not least, the anonymous<br/>
author of &quot;Lather, rinse, repeat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With such a rich background in literature and concern for detail in games,<br/>
John is making a valuable contribution to the EverQuest Live team!</div>
