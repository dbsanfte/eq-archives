<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109414873">Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve gone too far this time.<br/>
<br/>
I sent a email complaining to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bmcquaid@...">bmcquaid@...</a> (Brad), <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jbutler@...">jbutler@...</a><br/>
(Jeff Butler) and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jsmedley@...">jsmedley@...</a> (john smedley).  I suggest that anyone<br/>
who feels strongly that this will compromise EverQuest send these three a<br/>
courteous email regarding the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t flame, be polite and be concise.  Hopefully we can get them to see<br/>
reason.  I personally will not be playing again until/unless that part of<br/>
the eula is removed.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been wonderful.... farewell my friends...<br/>

&gt; Well, since Mr. Smedley and company have decided that to protect their own<br/>
&gt; backside (see....lies we got away with till some smart users outfoxed us)<br/>
&gt; and are putting this in their EULA....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files to you. You<br/>
&gt; also grant us permission to access, extract and upload<br/>
&gt; (i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii) data<br/>
&gt; relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion, determine<br/>
&gt; interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will no longer be financially supporting EQ in any way, shape or form.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know what caused it - I know I have neither the technical expertise, or<br/>
&gt; equipment setup to do it - but I&#39;ll be DAMMED if I am going to give some<br/>
&gt; gaming company - companies that are notorious for hiring &#39;you want fries<br/>
&gt; with that help&#39; permission to sniffel around the innards of my PC.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In case the above doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to you - in plain English it<br/>
&gt; means....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You give us permission to look at anything WE think we need to inside your<br/>
&gt; PC - and upload it to our offices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know bout the rest of you, but I have a heck of a lot of personal<br/>
&gt; information, CC #s, Tax information, etc on the same machine I use for<br/>
&gt; &#39;gaming&#39; - and I&#39;ll be dammed if I give them a blank check to poke around<br/>
&gt; as they see fit - and ship things of interest back to their offices. Sorry<br/>
&gt; - trust only goes so far.<br/>
