Thanks for taking the time to do all the detailed testing on this song.  If<br/>
Verant gives us an official response to your message, can you post it to the<br/>
list? <br/>
<br/>
Also, there was one mistake in your post.  Not certain if it warrants<br/>
posting a correction to the thread.  You listed Lullaby as the level 16<br/>
song.  Its the level 15 song.  Level 16 is the underwater breathing song.  I<br/>
would hope Verant knew you were talking about the level 15 song but you<br/>
never know.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Galtin<br/>

&gt; Please bump it so we can be sure Verant sees it and gets it<br/>
&gt; fixed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lullaby (bard L16 song) is not working as GZ stated it should<br/>
&gt; during his Lullaby test.  The relevant portions of that test<br/>
&gt; are quoted below:<br/>
