&gt;Subject: Level 27 and Kunark<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just got to Kunark last night (had to finish some Lambent. Still can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;get a group on the Rathe to<br/>
&gt;do MM for Gloves or the Gypsy lute)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After a terrible time with the boat, I fell off the skiff. Swam to an <br/>
&gt;island, took a boat to the<br/>
&gt;evil outpost and then the fun began.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe, the first time I tried to take the skiff to the Kunark boat, I noticed <br/>
that the skiffs had 2 levels; the top, and a small space underneath.  So <br/>
stupid me decides to get into the space underneath.  Of course when we get <br/>
to the big boat, you can&#39;t board it from the lower level of the skiff.  <br/>
Fortunately I had levitate memmed so I managed to wedge myself into a little <br/>
nook on the side of the boat (where the side &quot;wing&quot; sails attach to the <br/>
boat).   I had to swim to Firiona Vie when we docked because I was of course <br/>
on the wrong side of the boat... hehe<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Got to see several places in Kunark and the graphics are amazing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes they are, and it&#39;s so nice that they finally added the sounds.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now to my question..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Suggestions on where to hunt? Fironia Vie seemed to have a lot of black, <br/>
&gt;yellow and red that could<br/>
&gt;be charm fought. Or the Swamp of No hope and Warsilik Woods looked ok as <br/>
&gt;well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, not too sure where you can solo well, maybe Lake of Ill Omen around <br/>
the lake has some wondering mobs that you could do.  Just be careful and con <br/>
anything before you attack it.  The day Kunark opened I went sight-seeing <br/>
with a small group of level 51&#39;s and they attacked a Iksar Crusader (I think <br/>
they&#39;re guards).  It was blue to them and nuked them (and me of course) into <br/>
oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I really want to caution you about is this:  Be VERY careful using <br/>
charm when fighting in Firiona Vie.  There are a lot of little Firiona <br/>
Drixies (look very innocent and pretty, like very colorful butterflies) and <br/>
pilgrims that are basically sort of like wandering guards in the zone.  They <br/>
frequently help you out in fights, but you have to KS them sometimes... hehe <br/>
   The problem is that if a Drixie joins in your fight and aggros on a mob <br/>
that you charm, the Drixie will then aggro on you too.  You will die quickly <br/>
and messily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know frontier Mt.&#39;s is an option but that requires a group I think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it does require a group, as most of the mobs tend to be in the high <br/>
20&#39;s, low 30&#39;s but in a good group, the exp just flies by.  It might be <br/>
slightly higher than you should probably go at this point however.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Any suggestions will be much appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
