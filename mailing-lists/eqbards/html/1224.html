<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522522230">I was completely amazed tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Was fleeing upper Guk as things got a little heavy, only the smallest sliver of life left, unsure I could make it past the chasm of inches to the exit.  A Froglok novice cast a passing shot at me: poison.  I sighed relief as I made it out, and immeditely started singing Hymn of Restoration--but before I could sit down... I pass out unconscious!<br/>
<br/>
I hovered it seemed a very long time, looking down on my crumpled form, waiting for the poison to kill me... yet I was still singing Hymn of Restoration!  Who would win?  The infernal poison or the bard miraculously singing a rather complex song in his sleep?  A minute passed.  I came to my feet!  Only to swoon into unconsciousness again!  It was madness!  But I will say that this bard never missed a beat in his song and survived!<br/>
