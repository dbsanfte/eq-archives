<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561644485"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ok, for those who missed the last post, I am a level 7, almost 8 bard.<br/>
&gt; Right now I am using a regular Long Sword.  Not too dramatic..:)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I get dual wield at 17, and that sounds nice but I was <br/>
&gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; what it maxes out at and if its better to get dual wield for <br/>
&gt; 2 1h slashers<br/>
&gt; or to invest in a 2h slasher like a bibs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t increase your skills with 2-handed weapons, so stick to practicing<br/>
1-h blunt, 1-h slash & pierce.  <br/>
<br/>
Your using a long sword at level 7?  You&#39;re doing better in life than I was<br/>
at your age.  I&#39;m using a bronze mace right now until my 1h blunt gets<br/>
maxed.  Then I&#39;ll break out a short sword.  I&#39;ve already maxed piercing for<br/>
my level with a FS rapier someone was kind enough to include in a trade for<br/>
a HQ bear skin I&#39;d looted.  Look to get a combine weapon as soon as you can.<br/>
No idea how much they cost as I can never find a vendor selling one. (grrr)<br/>
<br/>
happy hunting<br/>
