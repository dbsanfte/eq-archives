<b>Subject:</b> Too many off-topic posts regarding server/guild politics <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-691957827">I don&#39;t think posts of this nature are appropriate on this forum. This<br/>
is a discussion group relating to bard issues, not guild/server<br/>
politics. Although it&#39;s great to exchange thoughts on dragon raids, I<br/>
feel discussing politics pertaining to Innoruk/Veeshan, who is a KSer,<br/>
etc. aren&#39;t what eqbards is about. I only point this out because I<br/>
logged onto my e-mail this evening and received 191 e-mails since<br/>
yesterday evening, and the majority seem to be complaints about some<br/>
guild on Innoruk.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep discussions relating to the Bard class. If you feel a need<br/>
to discuss server politics, EQ Vault hosts a very nice series of<br/>
server-specific boards where issues of this nature may be addressed.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hehehe wow someone who knows who FoH is. I play on Veeshan with a lvl 50<br/>
&gt; necro and run in to them ks&#39;ng me all the time on big events. My guild and a<br/>
&gt; few others got so sick of it we are banding together. Now FoH posted a<br/>
&gt; message on Sony&#39;s message board about how there are so many high lvls on the<br/>
&gt; servers that there need to be more planes and more dragons and what not<br/>
&gt; cause there is going to be lots of KS&#39;ng and fighting over spawns and what<br/>
&gt; not. Man someone finally gets the player base to stand up to them and they<br/>
&gt; run whimpering with there tails between their legs. Pay back&#39;s a bi**h.<br/>
&gt; Anyways been lurking for a couple days getting ideas just started a twink<br/>
&gt; bard and got it up to lvl 7. </span></blockquote></div>
