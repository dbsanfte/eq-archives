&gt;some way when comBined they totally rule.  Using Both the Sash and Singing<br/>
&gt;Anthem De Arms I took a 21/7  weapon down to a 14/7 one, and a 24/8 down to<br/>
&gt;15/8.  These are phenomenal stats.  Get a Sash when you can.  They are<br/>
&gt;great<br/>

&quot;This is one of the most sought after items in the game for melee classes.<br/>
It is worn in your belt slot. It increases your attack speed by roughly 25%<br/>
 and can be found in Lower Guk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, apparently on Vallon Zek, at least, there is a new &quot;Electrum Bladed<br/>
Koshigatana&quot; that also has the &quot;Haste&quot; effect. DMG 6, Delay 20, and Bards<br/>
can use it...<br/>
