<div id="ygrps-yiv-146654614">Pain and suffering is not a person or character. Its literally &quot;Pain and<br/>
suffering&quot; If you&#39;ve ever fallen to your death, pain and suffering<br/>
attempts to strike you also. I believe it has to do with these<br/>
non-combat types of deaths. Pain and suffering never seems to hit<br/>
either, it always misses.</div>
