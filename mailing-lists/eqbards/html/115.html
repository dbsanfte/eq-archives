<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645459563">Thanks for the info! I&#39;m only at the fifth circle now, but will be looking<br/>
to purchase a drum in the near future (I do not believe that I may even use<br/>
such an instrucment until I reach the seventh circle).<br/>
I assume this only works for wood-elves, though. Is this true, for am I human.<br/>
Maybe I can find a mage of some sort to disguise my appearance with an<br/>
illusion.<br/>

&gt;Try to use the message board for bards, not promoting your guild. So<br/>
&gt;one guy has a problem, and you can&#39;t please everybody. But try to help<br/>
&gt;bards out by tips, tactics and quest hints, not guild promotion. You<br/>
&gt;may be a good guild, I don&#39;t know, but please try to keep it<br/>
&gt;uncommercialized. Thankyou. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For instance, any woodelf bard can give 4 spiderling silks to the guild<br/>
&gt;leader in kelethin and get a hand drum. This quest can be done over and<br/>
&gt;over and the drums can be sold for about 3-4 gold. Not to shabby for<br/>
&gt;newbies.<br/>
