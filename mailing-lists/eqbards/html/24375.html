Glad to see you back! I only participated on a naggy raid and just went in <br/>
ordinary full lambent except for the helm (SSB sold my other helm a while <br/>
back) and boots (singing steel). I think only other resist gear I had on me <br/>
at the time was my runed bone fork. :-P I was given short notice, so I went <br/>
there with all I had on.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, fully buffed, and weaving my rhythm songs my resists were probably <br/>
in the 150-200 range. Never got feared, I don&#39;t remember if I got burned, <br/>
but it didn&#39;t matter anyway. All our tanks died against Naggy, leaving just <br/>
me, an enchanter and a cleric in my particular group and Naggy at half health.<br/>
<br/>
A bard as the only tank left against Naggy is a bad thing. Had to have the <br/>
rescue team scrape my armor off of his foot. :-P<br/>
<br/>
This was a pick-up dragon group, so by all means, wait until a well <br/>
organized raid is setup. While they were good enough to get us through the <br/>
giants, they didn&#39;t have enough firepower to finish Naggy off (only 2 <br/>
wizards). I believe a good guild can whip through and kill Naggie pretty <br/>
quickly, maybe an average of 4 hours? Mine took almost 8 hours (including <br/>
all the corpse recovery and resses afterwards). Ugh, quite the nightmare.<br/>

&gt; &gt; level is the most important resist item.  so the lower level you are, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher you want your resists at.  generally an unbuffed 100CR or 100FR is<br/>
&gt; &gt; good for vox or nag, respectively.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Btw what would you all consider the minimum resist gear for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bard of 47th<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level to wear at a nag/vox raid?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Currently I dont have anything special in the ways of resists...<br/>
