<div id="ygrps-yiv-335776449">I was meaning more the new mana song at 20, exp penalty on hybrids<br/>
rollback, and the song fixes that have been put in. (Lullaby is fixed now<br/>
isn&#39;t it?) Should have more options now than when we all started at release,<br/>
more places to hunt, more people hopefully appreciate a bard, etc. I see<br/>
groups looking for bards alot around mid teens in Lake Of Ill Omen where my<br/>
cleric currently is. She went from one bubble to 17 to 2 bubbles into 19 in<br/>
a few hours out there with just her and a rogue, same level. Of all the<br/>
things V does so wrong, I have to give them credit for doing a good job on<br/>
the zone size / spawn rate in zones like Ill Omen. There were 128 people in<br/>
the zone yesterday and we still had all we could pull.<br/>
General Interest Question: On Xegony, Greater Faydark is commonly known as<br/>
Faymart, where you can find any of your shopping needs. Is this the same on<br/>
other servers?<br/>
