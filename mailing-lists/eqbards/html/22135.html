Fool me once shame on you.  Fool me twice shame on me.<br/>

I for one do not expect to see any improvements made to the bard class ever<br/>
again.  Much easier to not get disappointed/frustrated when your<br/>
expectations are low to start with.<br/>

Has John(tm) once told me, &#39;Your problem is you still have hope&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If they do fix it so we can keep 2-3 mobs locked down I will be one of the<br/>
first to thank them.<br/>
<br/>
I am not getting my hopes up.<br/>

&gt; One can only hope.  Realizing Rokenn has been around the block (and taken<br/>
&gt; into the alley and pummeled once or twice), I can understand his cynicism.<br/>
&gt; But just maybe....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, does anyone know when the next patch is scheduled?  Can&#39;t do web at<br/>
&gt; work = (.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Title says it all; here&#39;s Absor&#39;s post:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are looking into a few bardic changes. Nothing is set in stone yet on <br/>
&gt; this, it still has to be reviewed, but I thought I&#39;d let you know what<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thinking about. We are thinking about reducing secondary resists for <br/>
&gt; targeted mesmerize songs (with the possibility of a new song along these <br/>
&gt; lines). There are some other potential changes that we are considering,<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll have to tell you about them after we have a chance to talk them over <br/>
&gt; further.<br/>
