<b>Subject:</b> Equipment Advice of the Moment <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614370700">Yes, fellow bards, I know we discuss equipment often, but somehow it&#39;s<br/>
different when I have a store of both funds and ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
In a business deal that worked out well I found myself with what to the<br/>
typical 15th level bard is a goodly sum of platinum.  I&#39;m trying to spend<br/>
it wisely to upgrade my equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I already have all my songs, except the useless identify song.<br/>
<br/>
Presently for weapons I have a Combine long sword and a Dragoon Dirk.  I&#39;m<br/>
practising as much as I can with the Dirk but seem at a dead end in my<br/>
piercing skill, stuck at Bad while my 1H slashing skill is Good.  I carry a<br/>
Round Shield.<br/>
<br/>
My armor is an assortment of banded, ring, and chain.  I recently bought<br/>
bronze sleeves and I still have leather gloves.<br/>
<br/>
I wear a spiked collar for +3 strength, a Purity Belt for +2 strength, two<br/>
+1 strength earrings and two +2 strength rings, to push my base of 90 to 101.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m most often found in Kelethin in the Veeshan aspect of Norrath, although<br/>
at the moment my friends and I have a mission near Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Appearance counts.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
So what sage advice can I solicit from those who have gone before me?  In<br/>
my immediate future what items should I seek and what prices should I<br/>
expect to pay?<br/>
<br/>
As to my present mission, my closest companions, a human cleric and a dwarf<br/>
warrior, and I will soon be paying a visit to the despicable Dorn in North<br/>
Ro.  Among us we have multiple deaths to avenge.  Fear us, Dorn.  Tonight<br/>
you die.  And die.  And die.<br/>
