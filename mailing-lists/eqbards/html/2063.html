I am enjoying the sage and experienced words of our higher level brothers<br/>
and <br/>
sisters.  But where are the young ones such as myself?  The tales and <br/>
adventures I read here are things I won&#39;t be seeing for some time to come.  <br/>
Are there any others in the 5th to 10th season with advice and knowledge to <br/>
share as well?  Let&#39;s speak up and help each other with similar questions.<br/>
I <br/>
have questions as well which I will post later (time for work!).<br/>

Evulia of Tunare at your service.  I&#39;m just a hair from level 8 and about to<br/>
begin hunting in Qeynos Hills.  But I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve got any expertise<br/>
to share just yet.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question though.  I&#39;ve been travelling with a level 8 halfling<br/>
druid friend of mine, and whether singing or not, she outruns me by a long<br/>
shot.  At the time we were both stripped of everything (multi-zone trip, so<br/>
all posessions went into the bank) and she had not cast any buffs on either<br/>
of us.  Are wood elves/bards naturally slower than halflings/druids?  I<br/>
spent some time hunting in Mysty (just long enough that I was ready to<br/>
attack the guards for killing every mob within an 8 mile radius of the wall<br/>
just when I had them down to their last breath!) and noticed that while<br/>
running with Accelerado I was still getting passed by others (presumably<br/>
using SOW).  Anyone care to shed some light on this?<br/>
