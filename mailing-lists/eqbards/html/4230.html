<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133005926">At level 27 you are too powerful for the mobs outside in the pass.   <br/>
     You would want to hunt the basement which was full of dark red MOBs to  <br/>
     me as 18.  Just find the bank (in the basement go figure) and hang a  <br/>
     left instead of a right.<br/>
      <br/>
     BTW  I was exploring HHK last night and the upper stories are  <br/>
     enormous.  I found a room with two bards but neither would talk to me.  <br/>
     (amiable)  Anyone know what they are about?  Is there anything  <br/>
     interesting upstairs to do? Quests to start?  I&#39;ve never seem so many  <br/>
     guards in my life.   <br/>

Has anyone here spent much time in this zone?  My group (level 27) is looking  <br/>
for a new place to hunt, and have heard this might be a good zone.  I know  <br/>
nothing much about it though.<br/>
      <br/>
Anyone care to give a description/walkthrough?<br/>
