<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-20026617">It has been my experience that Necros and Shaman both love Bards, since they<br/>
can cannibalize themselves with no penalty.  That being said, during group<br/>
med times I usually twist both Healing and Mana Song whenever any party<br/>
member is damaged.<br/>
