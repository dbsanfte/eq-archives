<div id="ygrps-yiv-729585541">Lament is targetted - for pulling. Got 3 mobs and only want to bellow at<br/>
one to pull - use Lament. And no - when it wears off, you are not on their<br/>
hate list.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby is an AE song. Got 20 orcs dogpiling you in the entrance to<br/>
Crushbone - fire up lullaby - will give you a second to run if nothin else<br/>
(more likely the other people around you). They can and do break out of it<br/>
and when they do they are REAL ticked off at the bard - but the next pulse<br/>
puts them back to sleep if successful. I&#39;ve also found lullaby a wonderful<br/>
way to help newbies. If you are standing there putting the monster to sleep<br/>
- and they only are hitting one out of 5 time - yes....when they do hit<br/>
them they wake up, but it takes the heat out between all those misses, and<br/>
if it wakes up it&#39;s usually on you - not them.<br/>
<br/>
The thing a new bard has to learn about AE songs is where to safely use<br/>
them. Don&#39;t use them where there is stuff you might not want to hit<br/>
wandering by - like, ummm....guards.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have my bard - and I have an enchanter. The enchanters <br/>
&gt;&gt; charisma is nearly<br/>
&gt;&gt; twice that of my bard.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I just WISH her lull lined worked as effectively as lament <br/>
&gt;&gt; has for me since<br/>
&gt;&gt; the day I got it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So if lament is really that great, why are you higher level folks always<br/>
&gt;arguing about whether crowd control is best done with Lullaby, Chain, or<br/>
&gt;Charm?  Is it just that they hit multiple mobs at once?  Or are they better<br/>
&gt;than Lament even for single mobs?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks to everyone who&#39;s joined in on this thread.   Sorry to be such a<br/>
&gt;newbie.<br/>
