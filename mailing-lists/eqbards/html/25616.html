<br/>
&quot;Also, as a reminder, all EverQuest subscribers will need to have DirectX <br/>
8.1 or better installed on their system in order to play beginning Tuesday <br/>
morning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the MOTD last night said that version 8.0a or later was required.<br/>
<br/>
Could you please clarify which one it is? Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I sure can. It&#39;s Directx 8.0 or better. Sorry about the confusion.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Only now, you also say,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;Because Windows 95 does not support DirectX 8.1 and our new and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>improved EverQuest engine requires the use of this version of DirectX, we <br/>
can no longer support Windows 95.<br/>
We apologize for this inconvenience but in order to play EverQuest and <br/>
enjoy the benefits of the new engine you must upgrade to Windows 98 or <br/>
greater and install DirectX 8.1.<br/>
<br/>
Alan&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Will you be providing refunds for people who cannot upgrade to Win98 who <br/>
already purchased SoL?<br/>
<br/>
How is it that the system requirements changed in between 12/03 and 12/04 <br/>
anyway?<br/>
