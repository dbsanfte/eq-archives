&gt; <br/>
&gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this<br/>
&gt; is a guild of 150+<br/>
&gt; different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but<br/>
&gt; the leaders of the guild<br/>
&gt; are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs,<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t need a haste<br/>
&gt; item. (even tho they stack)  being a huge guild, the<br/>
&gt; leaders get whines and<br/>
&gt; rants all the time, so our chances of convincing<br/>
&gt; them otherwise is very<br/>
&gt; slim.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; any ideas?<br/>
