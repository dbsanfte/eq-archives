 </span></blockquote>If you wish to nitpick, then you are correct. We&#39;re<br/>
not casters. But we have the equivilant of spells<br/>
in our songs. We get *one* &#39;mystical power&#39; per level<br/>
whereas other characters get *multiple* &#39;mystical<br/>
powers&#39; per level. These &#39;mystical powers&#39; are the<br/>
backbone of our class just as they are the backbone<br/>
of the other classes. <br/>
<br/>
Does that fit your requirements a bit better? The<br/>
comparison isn&#39;t silly at all. We only get one<br/>
song per level. It would be nice to have that only<br/>
song be worthwhile. The poster I replied to was<br/>
comparing a caster having a useless &#39;power&#39; to our<br/>
having a useless &#39;power&#39;. I was pointing out that<br/>
when we have a single useless &#39;power&#39; it&#39;s not the<br/>
same as a caster since they get more of these to<br/>
choose from than we do.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing silly in that.</div>
