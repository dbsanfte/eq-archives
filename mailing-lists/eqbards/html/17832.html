with weapons, and if you&#39;re doing that often enough that you<br/>
feel you need one of these items, what&#39;s the point of being in<br/>
a guild?).  The extra AC and stats are nice, but in no way<br/>
make up for the additional haste (10%-15%) that another melee<br/>
class could gain from these two items.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This I would sort of agree with, sort of disagree with.  With<br/>
a low-end haste item like a swirlspine belt or FBSS, a bard<br/>
could arguably gain *more* benefit than any other melee class.  <br/>
Take the FBSS for example.  It gives a 21% haste.  For a L50<br/>
bard whose normal melee haste is 30% (Verses), the FBSS will<br/>
put them at 75% haste - a 35% improvement.  For a sub-50 bard<br/>
whose normal max melee haste is 20% (Celerity), the FBSS gives<br/>
a 45% improvement.  In the hands of any other melee class,<br/>
it&#39;s only a 21% improvement unless they&#39;re grouped with a bard<br/>
or enchanter or shaman (only then does it become a 75%<br/>
improvement).  The difference is even more pronounced with a<br/>
swirlspine belt which from reports is a 15% haste.  I dunno<br/>
how many bard/ench/sham are in your guild so I can&#39;t say how<br/>
compelling an argument that would be.  But if the melee<br/>
classes rarely group with bards and enchanters, then the melee<br/>
argument favors the bard as most able to use a FBSS or<br/>
swirlspine.<br/>
<br/>
Now, OTOH, a bard of the right level to get these items has a<br/>
*lot* of other tools available.  My Belt of Concordance goes<br/>
mostly unused - a single Chant with my Selo&#39;s drum equals or<br/>
exceeds my average melee output with weapons and max haste.  <br/>
The only time I use my weapons lately is when I feel like<br/>
diving into melee, or if the mob is pretty much immune to<br/>
magic, or if I&#39;m prohibited from using the chants (TTs in<br/>
Fear seem to poof if they die from a DoT).<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend to your guild leader that rather than<br/>
completely exclude bards from these items, to set up a<br/>
&quot;scorecard.&quot;  If a bard has helped (say) 5 other people in the<br/>
guild get a FBSS or swirlspine belt, then the next one is his.  <br/>
That avoids the slippery slope problem where newer younger<br/>
guildmembers keep getting ahead of you in priority.  I would<br/>
stay out of the CoF and RBB entirely, but if you really want<br/>
one, I&#39;d suggest something like seeing 25-30 of them given to<br/>
guildmembers before you&#39;re allowed to roll for it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not many guilds on Karana with 150+ players.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the leaders of the guild<br/>
&gt; are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they don&#39;t need a haste<br/>
&gt; item. (even tho they stack)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Their reasoning is wrong - if you follow it through like I did<br/>
above, bards get the *most* melee benefit from haste items of<br/>
any class.  But for the other reasons I outlined above, I<br/>
pretty much have to side with them.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, they damn well better be willing to break their backs to<br/>
teleport a bard up to air if a Belt of Concordance drops and<br/>
there&#39;s no bard present.<br/>
