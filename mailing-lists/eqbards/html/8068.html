<br/>
Q:  Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana regeneration<br/>
speed for your party members?<br/>
A: No.  What the Jig does is increase the rate of  Stamina Regeneration<br/>
every six seconds and hence the display of the Stamina, Health, and Mana<br/>
bars to show this increase.  Without the song playing the bars are refreshed<br/>
every eight seconds.  The ultimate effect of this is that the mana bar<br/>
&quot;moves&quot; every six seconds instead of every eight seconds so it APPEARS to be<br/>
moving FASTER.  In actuality - it is moving 75% of the distance it would<br/>
move if it waiting the other two seconds.  So bottom line, it LOOKS like it<br/>
is regenerating faster but it does not.  If you don&#39;t otherwise have a need<br/>
to regenerate stamina, you are wasting a memorized song slot<br/>
<br/>
When people ask me to play Jig to increase mana, I use a condensed version<br/>
of Talies explanation and they usually accept it.  If they don&#39;t, their<br/>
problem not mine.  Galtin shouts &quot;24 bard looking to lend his talents to a<br/>
group&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m 24th level and blue mobs still knocked me down to 25% health or<br/>
force me to zone when I solo.  Bards get better at soloing once they can do<br/>
the fear/chain combo.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; When I play EQ I allways get asked to play the Jig to increase mana<br/>
&gt; regeneration. I was asked this for 4 times today and I really hate it. I<br/>
&gt; even got kicked from a group when I refused to play it because the mana is<br/>
&gt; not regenerating faster. Can anyone recommend me what to do?<br/>
&gt; I have one more problem. I&#39;m lvl 15 at the moment and I can hardly ever<br/>
&gt; solo<br/>
&gt; a blue creature. I&#39;m wearing full banded armor, and I have my 1H slash<br/>
&gt; allways maxed. I&#39;m using tentacle whip as a weapon, no it&#39;s not twinked I<br/>
&gt; got it as in a bet when someone didn&#39;t beleive me that selo&#39;s is faster<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; sow. And I just bought the armor. Can anyone please tell me why can&#39;t I<br/>
&gt; solo<br/>
&gt; a blue creature without loosing 90-95% of my health.<br/>
