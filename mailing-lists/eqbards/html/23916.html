<div id="ygrps-yiv-564982240">I have folks from my guild I group with a  log (although the class combo<br/>
doesn&#39;t lead to the &quot;Ultimate&quot; Group) - but also - maybe I&#39;m lucky but I<br/>
find positive pickup experiences a good 75 percent of the time or more.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately  the real issue is people&#39;s attitudes.  Like most people - if you<br/>
TELL me to do something I wouldn&#39;t do otherwise - I&#39;m going to be negatively<br/>
disposed towards it.  However if you ask me - nicely - it&#39;s a different<br/>
thing entirely.  When I hear &quot;Play manasong please&quot; - particularly from a<br/>
cleric or enchanter - odds are - I&#39;ll include in my song twist - even if I<br/>
feel that it&#39;s less than ideal.<br/>

Totally agree with this, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be totally out of line<br/>
saying it. I urge any bard to find a regular party to group with (if<br/>
possible). This way you develop trust, and don&#39;t have to deal with people<br/>
trying to tell you how to play a bard.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;When people do this - I say &quot;Please don&#39;t tell me how to play my class -<br/>
&gt;since I&#39;m not telling you how to play yours&quot; - of course if people try to<br/>
&gt;imply you&#39;re not a good bard - you may even offer to leave the group so<br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;can find a better when (which essentially you did and just avoided a<br/>
&gt;confrontation)<br/>
