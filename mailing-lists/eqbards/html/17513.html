<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Medley Overhaul <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-309281618">For most of my career, I&#39;ve been a battle bard, right up there beating on<br/>
the mob with the rest of the tanks.  I feel more comfortable twisting buffs<br/>
and debuffs than damage songs (especially those nasty AEs...got me into<br/>
trouble more than once when I was young).  Most of this comes from the fact<br/>
that my group mainly consists of myself and a warrior.  When in larger<br/>
groups, I tend to just go with what I know: Celerity/Chant/Chains in battle<br/>
and Clarity/Hymn in downtime with a lute, Charm if there&#39;s one or two extra<br/>
mobs, Pixie for more.  I get really confused if there&#39;s a snarer or an<br/>
enchanter, usually switching Chains or Celerity for Fufil&#39;s but leaving them<br/>
memorized just in case.  In larger groups, the mobs go down so fast that<br/>
resists didn&#39;t really seem necessary, and in the smaller groups, buffs<br/>
seemed more needed than resists or damage songs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve started to wonder if I&#39;m working up to my full potential.  I&#39;m getting<br/>
to the point now where Charm is not as useful and my buffs don&#39;t play nice<br/>
with everyone else&#39;s.  I&#39;m starting to feel a little useless except as a<br/>
crack dealer.  Can anyone help me out here?<br/>
