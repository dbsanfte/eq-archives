<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005835021">Sounds like several of those positive changes are going to be tried out in the next patch: (quote from EQVault)<br/>
<br/>
  After a long meeting that started before lunch and ended just now (we did break to eat, though), here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to try out short-term:<br/>
<br/>
  1. Increase the grouping experience bonus significantly. It&#39;s currently 2% for each group member other than yourself. When it&#39;s finalized and about to go live, we will release the actual percentages.<br/>
<br/>
  2. Increase the experience modifier for underutilized Old World and Kunark dungeons. We will post the percentage by which these dungeons were increased when this data goes live.<br/>
<br/>
  3. Place more bind spots in the Old World and Kunark (we decided to try this as opposed to more teleports). These will most likely be placed somewhat near to dungeons we consider underutilized.<br/>
<br/>
  Realistically, these changes will probably go live not this patch (hey, it&#39;s tonight/tomorrow), but rather the next one.<br/>
<br/>
  More longer term, we are doing to randomize loot, re-path, and even totally revamp some Old World dungeons.<br/>
<br/>

All sound pretty good to me.  Perhaps increasing the xp and putting nearby bind spots will encourage people to hit some of those dungeons.  I doubt it though as it will still be really hard to get pick up groups in them, people are creatures of habit.<br/>
<br/>
Should we have a little pool to see who can guess the most number of new bind points?<br/>
