<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351930782">i haven&#39;t tested the attack speed slowdown, but i have tested snare.  i<br/>
guess rangers now have an 11 minute (!!!) snare.  though the snare icon<br/>
stays up, after absonant binding wears off the snare is cancelled.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The AGI/AC debuff is pretty significant, as well.  Between <br/>
&gt; the 45 AGI debuff<br/>
&gt; and the AC debuff, I dropped my AC by 62 points when I <br/>
&gt; managed to stick this<br/>
&gt; on myself.  My only concern in using this would be if the attack speed<br/>
&gt; component overwrote that of a shammie or enchanter (assuming <br/>
&gt; they cast their<br/>
&gt; spell first).  Has anyone had a chance to test this yet?  (I <br/>
&gt; imagine no<br/>
&gt; one -- including myself -- is in too much of a &quot;testing&quot; <br/>
&gt; mentality right<br/>
&gt; now, with so much new territory to explore, heh.)<br/>
