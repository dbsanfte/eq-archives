<div id="ygrps-yiv-258962418">Not overworked today.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that this is just a general (and possibly inaccurate)<br/>
observation made in the short amount of time it takes the screen to change<br/>
from the server select screen.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been (more than?) two years since EQ launched, and it *seems* to me<br/>
that server populations have peaked.  Not much talk of new servers, doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem like the newer servers are threatening to get as large as older ones,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering when the last of us will be kicked off the last server?  Yeah,<br/>
I&#39;m sure EQ2, and Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside, and whatever else will<br/>
be super, but I&#39;m having a hard time picturing myself saying, at anytime,<br/>
&quot;Well Atonal ole bud, it&#39;s been fun, but I&#39;m off to play something else<br/>
now.&quot;.  I mean, c&#39;mon!  The time invested, the character developed, the fun<br/>
had, the friends made, the equipment gained...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not mental, and I can walk away from the game when necessary (my job is<br/>
secure and my wife is happy), however, ...  the easiest way to explain this<br/>
is...I am Atonal.  In much the same way the reality of the body is the<br/>
vehicle of the mind, that collection of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s in *that* reality has<br/>
also been a vehicle of my mind.  I am he, and he is me.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the reality is, if EQ disappears tomorrow, life will go on, and the<br/>
majority of us will move on...but does that change the fact that our<br/>
characters are us, and to see them die, knowing they can never return would<br/>
not be truly painful, both mentally and emotionally?<br/>
<br/>
I tried to quit EQ once.  I figured that going to school, it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
worth the monthly fee.  About a month later, I realized that EQ was the only<br/>
game I wanted to play, even if I could only be on half of every month, or<br/>
less.  My free time was spent wishing I could play EQ.  So when I caved in,<br/>
and logged back on the first time after quitting, imagine my joy at seeing<br/>
Atonal, there in that character screen, merrily spinning in circles swiping<br/>
at air!<br/>
<br/>
Woot!!<br/>
<br/>
Ok...maybe I *am* mental...  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Long live,<br/>
Atonal</div>
