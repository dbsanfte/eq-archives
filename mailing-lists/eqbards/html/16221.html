inferred pretty positively that they are running on Unix, Solaris to be<br/>
exact. There&#39;s a job posting for a Sr Sysadmin there who&#39;s duty is to run<br/>
the game servers. 2-4 years Unix required. Some NT preferred. Some<br/>
Oracle. From that, my best guess would be world servers on Unix, Oracle<br/>
for the login/accounting server. Did DikuMud have it&#39;s own built in<br/>
database?<br/>
