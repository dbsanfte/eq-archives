<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027450740">The chant series does 14 per tick with a drum, for three ticks, as well as<br/>
lowering the MR, CR, or FR of the target by 25 points.  There is no change<br/>
to the resistance debuff without an instrument, but damage drops to 8 per<br/>
tick.  And, the very nature of the songs makes them very hard to resist in<br/>
the first place, much like Tashan or Malosi.<br/>
<br/>
Best use I can think of, is using Chant of Fire on monsters in Solusek that<br/>
have natural high fire resistance, so that druids and mages in your group<br/>
can be more effective.  And Curtailing Chant is useful all around, helping<br/>
out your wizard, enchanter, and necro friends where ever you are.<br/>
<br/>
As far as direct damage goes, DDD is pretty weak at that level.  Most<br/>
casters have a 44th level Direct Damage spell that does anywhere from 500 to<br/>
600 damage for 200 to 300 hundred mana, and a 39th level AoE or Column spell<br/>
that does anywhere from 100 to 200 damage per pulse, to up to four targets,<br/>
for three pulses.<br/>
<br/>
What DDD has going for it is the speed to cast it, two and a half seconds,<br/>
and the fact that it delivers all of it&#39;s damage at once, rather than<br/>
requiring the target mob stay in the rain area for all three pulses most AOE<br/>
requires.  It&#39;s also point blank, working just like any AoE bard song, the<br/>
four closest mobs will be in the effect radius.<br/>

&gt;These are the bard specific changes in the last patch (except for /follow,<br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;is just a huge benefit to a party with bards playing Selo&#39;s or 19)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bug fixes and newly implemented features<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- &#39;Procing&#39; (items that cast spells) weapons no longer break Bard&#39;s singing<br/>
&gt;- We have implemented an Auto-follow command.  To auto-follow another<br/>
&gt;player, target the character, then type &quot;/follow&quot;.  You must be grouped<br/>
with<br/>
&gt;the character in order to successfully carry out the command.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Spell Changes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- The Bard spell &quot;Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge&quot; will now require the use of<br/>
Mana.<br/>
&gt;- No spell or effect that accelerates the process of mana regeneration will<br/>
&gt;work on a Bard.<br/>
&gt;- Tuyen&#39;s Songs now have range.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, now that 38,43 and 46 are apparently working, any of you high level<br/>
&gt;bards have<br/>
&gt;the straight poop on them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In particular what&#39;s your take on Dirge?  How does the damage it does<br/>
&gt;compare<br/>
&gt;with the best damage song we have before then?  Looks like they made sure<br/>
&gt;it would be used only once in a long while, is it powerful enough to even<br/>
&gt;have memorized?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve heard 400+ dmg, how does that compare to other casters DD/AOE spells<br/>
at<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now that the two Tuyen&#39;s have a range, does anyone have numbers on them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tindayen the Curious bard of Povar &lt;g&gt;<br/>
