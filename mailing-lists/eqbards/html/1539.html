 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve kept an emergency kit for quite a while.  I used it recently when<br/>
D&#39;Vinn trashed me for daring to step across the zone into Crushbone.  My<br/>
kit was a backpack with 5 milk, 5 muffins, a tarnished bastard sword, and a<br/>
leather tunic.  The sword is my normal spare.  The tunic was left when I<br/>
got my banded.<br/>
<br/>
But that wasn&#39;t enough.  It was stinking pitch black dark at the Crushbone<br/>
zone, on both sides.  I hadn&#39;t noticed because I normally carry a light<br/>
stone.  So I went back and bought a large lantern which is now in the kit.<br/>
Later I bought a spare drum to add.<br/>

Nothing like having to use it to teach you what you need.<br/>
