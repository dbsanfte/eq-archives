<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ewww, hell no.  Rapiers look like crap.  So do Scimitars.<br/>
  It needs a unique special look.  In fact, I&#39;d like it to <br/>
  have some sort of animation sequence.  (glowing, pulsing,<br/>
  not flaming heh)  <br/>
<br/>
  Maybe a Ykesha sword with a blue tint and small electricity<br/>
  sparks hopping across the surface.  I mean they did mention<br/>
  that their engine supports a full range of animated objects<br/>
  and that they haven&#39;t taken full advantage of it yet.  But<br/>
  then again, Verant + Something_that_sounds_really_cool = Soon.<br/>
  <br/>
  Sometimes I think if they just add a little more flavour to<br/>
  the game with neat effects or unique graphics I&#39;d enjoy it<br/>
  a lot more. <br/>
 <br/>
  I mean let&#39;s face it our songs can do one of a handful of effects:<br/>
<br/>
  Blue sparkles.<br/>
  Gold flashes.<br/>
  Orange pulses.<br/>
  White shimmers.<br/>
<br/>
  Did I miss anything?<br/>
<br/>
  Casters get shafted too:<br/>
<br/>
  Red shock shimmers.<br/>
  Orange flames.<br/>
  Blue sparkles.<br/>
  Harmony/Bind effect.<br/>
  Snare/Root/Speed effects.<br/>
  Wind/Swarm/Drowsy/Dot effects.<br/>
  ...etc<br/>
  <br/>
  It&#39;s just pretty lame visually to cast Shock of Lightning or<br/>
  Careless Lightning and see red sparkles.<br/>
<br/>
  Back to bard related... I&#39;d like to see the hue of the sparkles<br/>
  change based on songs.  Like the Psalm series, Warmth is orange<br/>
  pulsed, Cooling is lightblue, Purity is green, etc.  Chant, <br/>
  Anthem, Celerity, Berserk, Victory all look like I&#39;m a L1 bard.<br/>
  You&#39;d think they could change the tint on them as you get better<br/>
  songs.  Dreaming, again.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
