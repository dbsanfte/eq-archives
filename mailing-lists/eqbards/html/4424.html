          Great stuff! (how&#39;s Finland these days) But I am curious how you <br/>
     came to the Damage +1 equaling the average damage potential of a <br/>
     weapon.  I pretty sure your right, from observed damage while playing <br/>
     but is there something you know that confirms this.  For example do <br/>
     you know how to calculate Max damage?<br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks,<br/>

  Ok, I still don&#39;t understand why I seem to be the only one that is<br/>
noticing what is wrong with the damned formula for weapon <br/>
efficiency used just about everywhere. That max damage / delay. <br/>
You don&#39;t do max damage with a weapon.. you do _average_ <br/>
damage. Yes dex and str and skill will make it closer to max <br/>
more often, but on those battles where damage efficiency<br/>
really counts as anything (meaning a tough foe, if its a real wimp <br/>
who cares what you wield, you sing back more health probably<br/>
than what it can do to you) you are doing really rarely max damage. <br/>
Now change the formula to damage+1 / delay and it represents<br/>
the average damage. And better yet to ease it out, do the reverse <br/>
calculation of delay/dmg+1 and it is way easier to check efficiencies <br/>
in your head without a calculator ;)<br/>
