3.´┐¢ You&#39;re doing what am doing - I got ISDN and fastest PC you can buy - and<br/>
I think maybe if i am lucky and dont get stunned I can get 3 going.´┐¢ But 2<br/>
for me - even 2 with screen icons is hard enough.´┐¢ John Kim is the only one<br/>
I know that has reported 4 songs - but that&#39;s a huge achievement - he must<br/>
be well out of melee combat when he does.´┐¢ I think 3 would be great but am<br/>
pretty happy if i can do 2 and remeber to equip my weps.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
4. 2HS and 2HB capped at 1 - left over from beta when they had it but felt<br/>
we needed to be nerfed - or some such.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Others reading this - please set me straight if i am misspeaking on these<br/>
issues.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Newbie Questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone, I&#39;m an experienced player, but a newbie bard. I&#39;ve been waiting<br/>
a long time to ask these questions, hoping they would answer themselves on<br/>
the list, but I&#39;m still curious! (The list has of course answered MANY other<br/>
questions I had.) The FAQ that was sent to the list earlier is really good,<br/>
and answered a lot of things I was wondering about, perhaps these questions<br/>
could be added to it. And yes, I looked in the archives, but they seem<br/>
almost impossible to search.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Anyway, here goes. Sorry if these have been gone over already to death. :P<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
1. What are a bard&#39;s more important stats for playing songs? I&#39;ve heard<br/>
Charisma is important - does it make it so the songs are more potent or so<br/>
that they are resisted less?<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
2. What is a good bard website?<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
3. What is the best way to cycle songs? Basically what I&#39;m doing now is<br/>
making a panel of hotkeys, then hitting 1 to start song, 1 again to stop, 2<br/>
to start second song, 2 to stop, etc. But I kind of got the impression from<br/>
the list that using´┐¢ a /stop hotkey might be faster? (It is almost<br/>
impossible for more to cycle three songs.)<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
4. Is it true bard 2h slash skill is capped at 1 (or something like that?)<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Hmmm I guess that is it for now.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Thanks in advance! :)<br/>
