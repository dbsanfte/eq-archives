<div id="ygrps-yiv-502390885">My point was if you are a bard you have to know people.  If you are an<br/>
enchanter or cleric or several of the other &quot;we gotta have that&quot; classes you<br/>
don&#39;t need to know anybody cause everyone wants you in their group.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s my point.  with the current crowding on servers, it&#39;s more important<br/>
who<br/>
you know and who your friends are than what your class is.<br/>
