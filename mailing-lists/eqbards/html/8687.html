<b>Subject:</b> Whatdya know, I CAN Screech <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160715964">I appreciate all of the replies to my &quot;I can&#39;t Screech&quot; thread, and here is<br/>
the outcome:<br/>
<br/>
Thinking that perhaps I&#39;d put no points into my Brass skill (which seemed<br/>
hard for me to believe), I ran to Qeynos and discussed the matter with our<br/>
trainer there.  Although he wouldn&#39;t tell me how many points I&#39;d put into<br/>
the skill, he wanted cash to raise it further.  Now I&#39;m used to that meaning<br/>
that there were already a few points in that skill, but perhaps a skill that<br/>
I gained several levels ago that I had not practiced still might require<br/>
cash to raise.  So I paid him a few gold and put about four points into the<br/>
skill.  Then I ran over to the PvP area of Qeynos and fired up DDD with a<br/>
HORN equipped.  Whatdya know, it started playing the animation and<br/>
increasing.  My first increase was to (35), however, not 5 or so.  At level<br/>
26, that may be the baseline skill level regardless of my practice level<br/>
though...<br/>
<br/>
SO.  What this means is, either there was some bug that had caused my Brass<br/>
skill to halt its increasing that I fixed by putting another couple of<br/>
points into Brass OR I&#39;d never put any points into it.  Either way I suppose<br/>
I&#39;m happy.  I got to stand in the newbie zone playing Screech and watch the<br/>
rats and snakes ping pong off of me for an hour or so.<br/>
