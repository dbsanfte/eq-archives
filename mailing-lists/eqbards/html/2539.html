<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502609014">I am not sure if it looks different - maybe you just need to look at it with<br/>
and outside view?  Did you change vid card drives?<br/>
<br/>
The first time I (my first char) saw a bard - she was playing her lute next<br/>
to the Qeynos Hills cottages (I think she knew that there is a music trigger<br/>
there and was having some fun with newbies (like me)).  We chatted and I<br/>
found out she was a bard (duh the lute was my first clue!) And when she<br/>
started to move off, I said watch out there is a griz over there. To which<br/>
she responded: &quot;Oh good! I shall slay it!&quot; And then zoomed off across the<br/>
hills doing the Selos run-zoom thing.  That was so cool looking - I just new<br/>
that I would be a bard someday.<br/>

		I suppose that is a good enough topic for this question.<br/>
Last night, I<br/>
		saw a bard playing a song that I thought I had never seen<br/>
before. I<br/>
		found out that it was Selo&#39;s, but it looked different than<br/>
when I play<br/>
		Selo&#39;s. It had the white pulsing flashes, but it also had<br/>
small purple<br/>
		lights or something. When does Selo&#39;s start to look<br/>
different? Anyone<br/>
		know?</div>
