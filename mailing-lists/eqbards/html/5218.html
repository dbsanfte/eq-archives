<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157352713">Does anyone know what happened to JM Capozzi.  I&#39;m sure he could settle this<br/>
issue once and for all.  Did Verant put a muzzle on him for posting details<br/>
of game mechanics on this list?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m in the US Army and have been playing EQ since April.  Until today<br/>
I have never seen/heard the term Black Helicopter used as a reference to<br/>
anything, military or EQ related.  What does this reference mean?<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I have also noticed an increase in missed notes but only since it was<br/>
brought up on this list.  IIRC, it happens mainly during combat when the lag<br/>
is bad.  If my wife lets me play anytime soon I will do some tests for<br/>
myself:-)    <br/>

&gt; Sorry, I am just more than a little ticked off at the &quot;Black Helicopter&quot;<br/>
&gt; comment earlier in the chain. And someone saying this is being imagined<br/>
&gt; because someone brought it to our attention. What I am saying is I never<br/>
&gt; missed notes on the bulk of my songs prior to 2 weeks ago. I have not gone<br/>
&gt; out and kept track of #s because it isnt realistic to what I am doing in<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; everchanging battle situation. I am in Lower Guk, the #s and types of mobs<br/>
&gt; is so fluid I may have to go from one strategy to a completely different<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; mid battle, and a missed note can cause the death of our whole party. Dont<br/>
&gt; laugh till you&#39;ve been there, all frogs are not created equal. If I cant<br/>
&gt; play my twisted tunes I may as well sing the Mana song and melee without<br/>
&gt; worrying about being a Bard anymore.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh sorry, thought I gave you numbers, I tried to use Denons 30 times and<br/>
&gt; &gt; missed notes everytime. It never fired. Are those good enough?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, you said &quot;maybe a total of 30 times&quot;.   Not exactly precise<br/>
&gt; numbers.<br/>
&gt; So you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s a 100 percent failure rate on a sample size of<br/>
&gt; 30?  I<br/>
&gt; certainly understand why you&#39;d be upset.  Thing is, that&#39;s awfully hard to<br/>
&gt; believe when I haven&#39;t had a failure rate of higher than 10 percent on any<br/>
&gt; song<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tested with recently.  Nobody else is claiming 100 percent failure<br/>
&gt; rates<br/>
&gt; either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not trying to be combative here, I&#39;m trying to figure out, with a<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; rigor, what&#39;s happening here, because simply bitching about it isn&#39;t going<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; get the problem fixed, if there is one.<br/>
