Thanks for the info.  Based on your formula, in group situations where you<br/>
will be fighting multiple mobs, then psalm of warmth will ALWAYS do more<br/>
damage than bellow by a large margin.  I remember someone posted on this<br/>
list a long time ago that at a certain point in a bards career the Bellow<br/>
song gets retired as a mainstay on their playlist.  Guess I finally reached<br/>
that stage:-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Is it safe to assume that weaving Psalm of Warmth with two other songs<br/>
&gt; will do more damage than a Bellow?  How much do mobs get burned for per<br/>
&gt; hit?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5 pts/hit.  You guys are lucky, it used to be 4 when I first<br/>
&gt; got it but got upgraded a couple months ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a mob hits for D points on average, and you have H hp, and<br/>
&gt; the damage shield does S damage per hit, then the damage<br/>
&gt; shield will do S*(H/D) points damage over the fight.  If the<br/>
&gt; mobs average N hits per song round (3-4 sec for most bards),<br/>
&gt; and Bellow does B damage on average (including resists),<br/>
&gt; Bellow will do (B/3N)*(H/D) points damage.  Divide to remove<br/>
&gt; the common factor and you end up with:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If B &gt; 3S*N then it makes more sense to use Bellow.  You can<br/>
&gt; figure out B and N with all the nifty new log parsers, S you<br/>
&gt; can tell from the messages when you&#39;re fighting.  This will<br/>
&gt; work for multiple mob encounters too, just add up all the mob<br/>
&gt; hits when determining N.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; e.g. if your Bellow does 12 points on average, the mobs<br/>
&gt; average 1 hit per round, and the damage shield does 5 points<br/>
&gt; per hit, then:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 12 &gt; 3*5*1<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; which is false, so in this case, it&#39;d be better to use Psalm.<br/>
