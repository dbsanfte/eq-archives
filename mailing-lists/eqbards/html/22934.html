<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766827033">Maybe we&#39;ll get lucky and this will get fixed now that they have finally<br/>
confirmed the Snare/Root bug that was introduced.  We&#39;ll see.  Verant&#39;s<br/>
testing in general still ranks at the &quot;pathetic&quot; level as far as I can see<br/>
and their understanding of their own code is pretty poor.  Amazingly the<br/>
percussion bug was reported by players on test and naturally promptly<br/>
ignored.<br/>

	I hate being right about something like this :(.  I really would<br/>
like to know why such a blatant bug on test would be propped to the live<br/>
servers.<br/>
<br/>
	Also, why is it that i can no longer outrun sow speeds without the<br/>
drum? Prepatch I was still faster than SOW without an instrument, now i am a<br/>
bit slower.<br/>
