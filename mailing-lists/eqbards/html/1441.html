the keyboard (old Netrek trick :-).  I use mouselook all the<br/>
time, and I have all the keyboard controls at my fingertips<br/>
all the time.  The only time I feel clumsy is when I&#39;m typing<br/>
a message and something happens (It&#39;s shift-del to erase a<br/>
message btw).  Otherwise my right hand is always on the mouse,<br/>
and my left hand is always at its rest spot on the keyboard<br/>
with all the commands immediately available.<br/>
<br/>
i.e. my movement keys are e, s, f, c; d is center<br/>
q is target nearest NPC, w is open inventory, r is run,<br/>
g is duck, z is switch camera, x is switch view, v is con,<br/>
etc.<br/>

Another advantage of this is that if you&#39;re using mouselook<br/>
(holding the right mouse button down) and you hit either the<br/>
left or right key, it strafes/slews instead of turns.  After a<br/>
while, that&#39;s easier to do than hit a different key, which is<br/>
good since I&#39;m running out of keys on the left side.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a &quot;natural&quot; keyboard which is split, so 5 and 6 are the<br/>
easiest keys to locate without looking.  My Selo&#39;s sits on 5<br/>
right now, although I&#39;m trying to condition myself to have it<br/>
on 6 since 5 is easier to twist with 3 and 4.  I&#39;d been<br/>
experimenting with having inventory slots on two banks so I<br/>
could keep Selo&#39;s always available.  At your level and speed<br/>
it probably doesn&#39;t matter anymore, but as we&#39;ve been<br/>
discussing here, at lower levels you *need* the drum to get<br/>
away from some mobs.<br/>
