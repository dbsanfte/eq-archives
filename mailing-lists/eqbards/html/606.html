<div id="ygrps-yiv-411216242"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;In another life I made the run from Freeport to Qeynos as a dwarf warrior<br/>
&gt;of the 6th level, in the company of a much higher level group and with the<br/>
&gt;benefit of Spirit of the Wolf for more speed.  It was somewhat of an ordeal<br/>
&gt;and I died twice trying to get through the minotaur pass, both times from<br/>
&gt;being stunned and disoriented as I tried to run through.  Without the work<br/>
&gt;and indulgence of the group I wouldn&#39;t have made it.  They even eventually<br/>
&gt;recovered all my belongings from my corpse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I could see 6th level in Beholder as a deadly experience...honestly I <br/>
would advise anyone to not even bother making a trip from Qeynos to Freeport <br/>
or vice versa until maybe level 8 (?), unless you really have to...and even <br/>
then it can be a pain. Hell, I stayed on Faydwer until level 10 for safety&#39;s <br/>
sake.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As a 10th level bard with a 10th level cleric friend I&#39;m getting more and<br/>
&gt;more interested in wider travel either alone or the two of us, but my fear<br/>
&gt;of the unknown keeps me from it.  It would be helpful to hear of the<br/>
&gt;adventures of other experienced travellers to help set my own expectations<br/>
&gt;properly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My fears are 1) getting lost, and 2) getting in overwhelming trouble from<br/>
&gt;getting into an area that&#39;s just too tough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I found that at lower levels (&lt;10) travelling on zone borders was <br/>
safest. It may take longer to get to where you want to go, but it might be <br/>
worth it.<br/>
<br/>
If you are worried about getting lost - I can&#39;t help you in specific terms <br/>
for any particular zone unless you name a destination. I do suggest the <br/>
Beholder route for travelling from Qeynos to Freeport and back...Highpass is <br/>
just a pain.<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting into trouble - having Accelerando is the key to staying <br/>
out of trouble. When I was a wizard (before I got my world gate spells), I <br/>
used to balk at the idea of travelling across the Plains of Karana because <br/>
of the griffons, homers, etc...an alert bard should have no worries. <br/>
HOWEVER, Oasis of Marr and the Desert of Ro areas can be a pain...I&#39;ve had <br/>
my share of bumping into Sand Giants, Lockjaw, Dry Bones, etc at the crest <br/>
of a dune, and getting spanked for my carelessness.<br/>
<br/>
Just stay very alert of your surroundings (i.e., watch your back - ALWAYS <br/>
watch over your shoulder). Some people never learn this. I couldn&#39;t count <br/>
how many times I have seen people stand still in the East Commons talking or <br/>
fighting, and they get smacked down by a passing griffon.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
