<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248378820">Do the numbers even go up after 255? I thought they stayed at 255 on your<br/>
screen no matter your resist.  Maybe wrong its been while since I played.<br/>

You mean 380MR when VI says the cap is 255 and anything over is wasted?<br/>
Or the people who say they resist less with 350 than with 190?  With the<br/>
first nag and vox raids when there was not a large variety of resist<br/>
gear, sure bards helped a lot.  Today, anyone can easily buff their<br/>
resists with equipment.  Tests are inconclusive as to what point resists<br/>
are soft-capped (anywhere from 175 to 255).  Level is the primary factor<br/>
in resisting.  Equipment gives you permanent resists and resists buffs<br/>
from other classes stay on you whereas resists from bards are gone when<br/>
they lag or die.<br/>
<br/>
i.e. there is nothing amazing about bard resists except impressing<br/>
others with big numbers, you haven&#39;t &quot;needed&quot; bards for resists in a<br/>
long time.  I&#39;m only talking about need with your and Dark&#39;s arguments.<br/>
You don&#39;t need a bard for resists, you don&#39;t need a bard for DS (every<br/>
person in an AL raid gets a diamond from the VP mage staff, DS done on<br/>
EVERY person in the raid, not just 6 people in 1 group).  You only need<br/>
1 bard for OOS.<br/>
<br/>
Now I agree with Dark about 6-man EXP groups.  Bards are incredible IF<br/>
they are filling in the role of enchanter/shaman.  If an enchanter or<br/>
shaman is there, there are things you CAN do, but the true skills of a<br/>
bard are wasted.  On a big raid if there is more than 1 bard there,<br/>
there are things you CAN do, but another class could help the raid much<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: I loved my bard, always have.  I didn&#39;t quit cause of bards,<br/>
was cause of RL.  I didn&#39;t come back as a monk for any reason, I liked<br/>
how cured silk looked on humans, that&#39;s about it.  Ya I am 50 now I do<br/>
love the monk but will always be a bard at heart.<br/>

I totally disagree Shada, bards are very useful, imo on large raids, the<br/>
resistances they provide alone are amazing...<br/>
