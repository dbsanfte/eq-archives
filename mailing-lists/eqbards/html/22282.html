<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943007745">Boy do I feel your pain!  I am NOT a twink, but since i have come back after<br/>
retiring I have been powerleveling mostly, and have as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Brigandine tunic (banded look)<br/>
lambent greaves (blue)<br/>
ss boots (green)<br/>
ss gloves (green)<br/>
skull shaped barbute (silver)<br/>
one lambent bracer (blue)<br/>
one imbrued bracer (dull yellow..seems to overwrite blue)<br/>
azure sleeves. (no graphic)<br/>
<br/>
The look is actually not too bad on a half-elf, but i get mistaken for a<br/>
twink all the time.<br/>

&gt; I have to kiss my lambent and tree weave goodbye soon and get some<br/>
&gt; imbrued,<br/>
&gt; im tired of looking like all the twinks with various ss and lambent.  Dont<br/>
&gt; get me wrong, i have nothing against twinking but man im sick of passing<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; something that is 20-30 levels lower then i really am.<br/>
