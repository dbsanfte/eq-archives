<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437073213">Yes, if you have CoC and some of us don&#39;t.  I plan on replacing binding with<br/>
CoC when I get it.  On the other hand, stacks does appear to be the right<br/>
word when an enchanter is involved.  I don&#39;t have hard numbers, but there<br/>
was a definate percieved difference between binding vs. enchanter slow vs<br/>
both.  This one appears to stack.<br/>
<br/>
As for chains, until the efreeti raid I would have agreed with you.  We had<br/>
a total of 4 druids involved all going for their boots ranging from 41 to 49<br/>
and not one got snare to stick... The bard had to save the day.  I&#39;ll always<br/>
keep this song up now for those situations where a runner means evac or<br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, very few of the bards on this list have CoC, but practically every<br/>
single one of them has Binding...<br/>

&gt; &gt; For example, this weekend we did the Efreeti raid...  We almost<br/>
&gt; screwed it<br/>
&gt; &gt; all up because one damn imp resisted all of the snare attempts<br/>
&gt; and started<br/>
&gt; &gt; running.  What saved the day?  Luckily the other bard in the group had<br/>
&gt; &gt; chains loaded and stopped the runner cold in its tracks.  Me<br/>
&gt; being a DOLT<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t have it up (last time I do that!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If there is only one snarer in the group, I keep it handy.<br/>
&gt; Two and I usually replace it with something else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What about the slow down effect?  Well your level 20 song is as good as<br/>
&gt; &gt; chains, has an area effect, doesn&#39;t break root and stacks with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanters slow downs.  IMHO this is a much better song for<br/>
&gt; during combat<br/>
&gt; &gt; and chains should be loaded for the emergency situations when everything<br/>
&gt; &gt; else fails.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as I can tell, Chain does not cancel other slowdowns<br/>
&gt; (&quot;stacks&quot; isn&#39;t the correct word since that implies the<br/>
&gt; slowdowns add to each other).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have enough difficulty deciding which songs to keep<br/>
&gt; memorized.  If I&#39;m going to have Chain loaded for emergencies,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d rather not have to keep Binding loaded.  Also, the<br/>
&gt; slowdown for CoC is not as great as for Chain/Binding from my<br/>
&gt; tests.<br/>
