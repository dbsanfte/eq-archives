<div id="ygrps-yiv-314807340">If these people were not in your group, and they were being handed their<br/>
asses, and you would have been handed yours as well, then you did the right<br/>
thing.  This is doubly true if your personally trying to help would have<br/>
involved your group by association.  The applies whether you&#39;re newbies<br/>
fighting spiderlings all the way up to the Plane of Fear.  It&#39;s in no way your<br/>
responsibility that these yahoos got themselves into fighting a named Brownie.<br/>
Maybe it agro&#39;d on them or perhaps they attacked it, it doesn&#39;t really matter.<br/>
Your responsibility is to yourself and your group, and the order of precedence<br/>
there is up to you.  Anytime someone helps me out I thank them for it, because<br/>
they don&#39;t have to.  If I&#39;m getting beaten down by a Skeletal Monk in Unrest<br/>
(which I can&#39;t handle at my level), I love it when people come to my rescue,<br/>
but I don&#39;t *expect* it.  When people stand by and watch me die, I don&#39;t like<br/>
that a single bit, but more often than not it&#39;s because they&#39;re either low on<br/>
health/mana or too weak to help without dying themselves.  Therefore I grumble<br/>
about the situations and move on.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve *ever* bitched someone<br/>
out because they didn&#39;t help.  A very few times I might have asked why someone<br/>
didn&#39;t, but the answer is usually logical.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was in Unrest and a mini-train was taking my party apart.  We<br/>
called &quot;run&quot; so I hit selo&#39;s and broke for the zone when I got down to a<br/>
single bubble.  I was doing ok, but I was having to stop and go trying to keep<br/>
everyone in Selo&#39;s range.  It&#39;s a long way from the back yard to the zone<br/>
(plus I was a couple of pounds encumbered - stupid) and I wasn&#39;t going to make<br/>
it.  I got rooted by a Ghoul near the fountains in the front yard and<br/>
proceeded to die.  I stopped Selo&#39;s and fired it back up to break the root and<br/>
about that time I hit the ground unconcious.  Just then a Paladin laid hands<br/>
on me - while on the ground unconcious.  I popped back up with almost full<br/>
health and broke for the zone amazed.  I made it out with the majority of my<br/>
group that time.  This Paladin wasn&#39;t in our group, he was just some 25th<br/>
level dude that was watching the train go by and saw me fall.  I scrolled back<br/>
trying to see who&#39;d Laid On Hands but the name didn&#39;t appear.  So I started<br/>
/telling around asking people until I found him and I thanked him profusely.<br/>
He only gets to do this once per game day, so it was pretty gratious of him.<br/>

&gt; I had a disturbing situation happen the other day.  I was sharing the<br/>
&gt; sisters bandit camp in Lesser fay with a group of 3 others.  All of the<br/>
&gt; other players were 15-16 level and in a group, and consisted of a Ranger,<br/>
&gt; Bard, and a Magician.  At the time I was 15th level and am quite capable of<br/>
&gt; soloing the camp while alone, so I wasen&#39;t milking off them.  We had a good<br/>
&gt; thing going and were being very friendly to one another untill something odd<br/>
&gt; happend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was waiting for my spawn, when I heared the sounds of battle behind me.  I<br/>
&gt; figured that they were killing a giant spider or somthing in between spawns<br/>
&gt; as I often do.  But something didn&#39;t sound right.  I turned around to see<br/>
&gt; the 16th level Bard and the 15th level Ranger, attacking a named Brownie.<br/>
&gt; My jaw dropped as I asessed the situation.  The brownie was hardly hit at<br/>
&gt; all and the two where below half health already.  Now was my time for snap<br/>
&gt; deciscions.  Should I help out, or should I bug out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I knew that they would die if they stayed, but I thought that the 16th bard<br/>
&gt; would kick in Selo&#39;s and run for the zone pulling the little nasty with him<br/>
&gt; and saving the party.  Thats what I would do.  Well I waited and the spell<br/>
&gt; caster managed to get off some big spells taking its health down about a<br/>
&gt; quarter, just as the Bard and the Ranger dropped.  By this time I had my<br/>
&gt; drum in hand and Selo&#39;s playing, I whacked the Brownie and headed for the<br/>
&gt; Greater Fay zone.  Much to my surprise, I could not out-run him by much, and<br/>
&gt; he stayed on my tail all the way to the zone, where I got out with a sliver<br/>
&gt; of life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;m feeling pretty good at this point, because I managed to save the<br/>
&gt; Spell Caster.  But as I&#39;m healing in the entrance to the lesser fay, the<br/>
&gt; Bard who died came up and started bitching me out for not helping.  I told<br/>
&gt; him that he was dead from the first hit, and asked him why he did not Selo<br/>
&gt; out for the zone with his party, but that just made him more mad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ended up stopping for the night to try think of anything I could have done<br/>
&gt; better, it all happend so fast.  Any suggestions?<br/>
