<br/>
&gt; (AP) The dreaded leader of the Rathe Seekers of Lore<br/>
&gt; was taken into wood<br/>
&gt; elf custody last night in the city of Kelethin.<br/>
&gt; Reports indicate that<br/>
&gt; Foladen Moonsong, aka DA BARD, was involved in a<br/>
&gt; drinking game with<br/>
&gt; several monks. They were doing dives off the city<br/>
&gt; platforms onto<br/>
&gt; unsuspecting newbies. Mr moonsong has been less than<br/>
&gt; successful at his<br/>
&gt; aim and was completely intoxicated. Matters got out<br/>
&gt; of hand when several<br/>
&gt; of the monks grew incensed upon finding that Mr<br/>
&gt; moonsong was using a<br/>
&gt; levitation song in addition to his safefall<br/>
&gt; abilities to help him out. A<br/>
&gt; melee broke out which ended with several monks being<br/>
&gt; charmed by the bard<br/>
&gt; and ordered to attempt to attack a rather irritable<br/>
&gt; priest of discord.<br/>
&gt; The gaurds were summoned by the screams of pain and<br/>
&gt; body parts the<br/>
&gt; priest was throwing around. Upon gathering comments<br/>
&gt; from witnesses, it<br/>
&gt; was determined Foladen was responsible but was also<br/>
&gt; missing. He was<br/>
&gt; found half an our later chasing pixies and peeking<br/>
&gt; up their skirts while<br/>
&gt; shouting boogie boogie boogie while bare naked.<br/>
&gt; Several gaurds were<br/>
&gt; rushed to the hospital after seeing that he had<br/>
&gt; somehow attained a blue<br/>
&gt; tint from his lambent armor useage. He was<br/>
&gt; immediately taken into<br/>
&gt; custody. The court has charged him with disturbing<br/>
&gt; the peace, public<br/>
&gt; intoxication, aggravated assault, newbie abuse,<br/>
&gt; sexual assault, public<br/>
&gt; nudity, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest,and<br/>
&gt; being downright rude. A<br/>
&gt; charge of contempt of court was added later due toa<br/>
&gt; mooning incident<br/>
&gt; with the judge.  Mr. Moonsong has attained his own<br/>
&gt; defense attorney,a mr<br/>
&gt; shraeven brightedge. he offered only one comment,<br/>
&gt; &quot;go figure.&quot;<br/>
