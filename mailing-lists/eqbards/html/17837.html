<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773173470">I doubt it is a bug.  I recall either Gordon or Bard stating that nearly any<br/>
haste item coupled with a haste song/spell will put players at max haste.<br/>

&gt; I would imagine that the Haste effects jumping to 75% no <br/>
&gt; matter which ones<br/>
&gt; you combine is a bug.  As such eventually its liable to get <br/>
&gt; fixed, probably<br/>
&gt; sooner rather than later since its a bug that benefits <br/>
&gt; players.  Once this<br/>
&gt; happens those lower end Haste items are not going to be as <br/>
&gt; good for a bard<br/>
&gt; as the high end ones, any more than they are for melee types.<br/>

&gt; &gt; tonight i found out that no longer will bards in our guild <br/>
&gt; be allowed on<br/>
&gt; &gt; lotto for haste items, ever. (unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 cloak of flames dropped off nagafen last time (i wasn&#39;t there or i<br/>
&gt; &gt; would&#39;ve known about this sooner) and bards were excluded <br/>
&gt; in the lotto.<br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; more runed bolster belts will be going to bards either.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CoF and RBB I have no problems with being non-bard.  We don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; benefit from the additional haste (unless you&#39;re chain/fearing<br/>
&gt; with weapons, and if you&#39;re doing that often enough that you<br/>
&gt; feel you need one of these items, what&#39;s the point of being in<br/>
&gt; a guild?).  The extra AC and stats are nice, but in no way<br/>
&gt; make up for the additional haste (10%-15%) that another melee<br/>
&gt; class could gain from these two items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (fbss only likely<br/>
&gt; &gt; one now, and only then if no other guild members that need <br/>
&gt; it are in group<br/>
&gt; &gt; according to guild rules)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This I would sort of agree with, sort of disagree with.  With<br/>
&gt; a low-end haste item like a swirlspine belt or FBSS, a bard<br/>
&gt; could arguably gain *more* benefit than any other melee class.  <br/>
&gt; Take the FBSS for example.  It gives a 21% haste.  For a L50<br/>
&gt; bard whose normal melee haste is 30% (Verses), the FBSS will<br/>
&gt; put them at 75% haste - a 35% improvement.  For a sub-50 bard<br/>
&gt; whose normal max melee haste is 20% (Celerity), the FBSS gives<br/>
&gt; a 45% improvement.  In the hands of any other melee class,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s only a 21% improvement unless they&#39;re grouped with a bard<br/>
&gt; or enchanter or shaman (only then does it become a 75%<br/>
&gt; improvement).  The difference is even more pronounced with a<br/>
&gt; swirlspine belt which from reports is a 15% haste.  I dunno<br/>
&gt; how many bard/ench/sham are in your guild so I can&#39;t say how<br/>
&gt; compelling an argument that would be.  But if the melee<br/>
&gt; classes rarely group with bards and enchanters, then the melee<br/>
&gt; argument favors the bard as most able to use a FBSS or<br/>
&gt; swirlspine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, OTOH, a bard of the right level to get these items has a<br/>
&gt; *lot* of other tools available.  My Belt of Concordance goes<br/>
&gt; mostly unused - a single Chant with my Selo&#39;s drum equals or<br/>
&gt; exceeds my average melee output with weapons and max haste.  <br/>
&gt; The only time I use my weapons lately is when I feel like<br/>
&gt; diving into melee, or if the mob is pretty much immune to<br/>
&gt; magic, or if I&#39;m prohibited from using the chants (TTs in<br/>
&gt; Fear seem to poof if they die from a DoT).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would recommend to your guild leader that rather than<br/>
&gt; completely exclude bards from these items, to set up a<br/>
&gt; &quot;scorecard.&quot;  If a bard has helped (say) 5 other people in the<br/>
&gt; guild get a FBSS or swirlspine belt, then the next one is his.  <br/>
&gt; That avoids the slippery slope problem where newer younger<br/>
&gt; guildmembers keep getting ahead of you in priority.  I would<br/>
&gt; stay out of the CoF and RBB entirely, but if you really want<br/>
&gt; one, I&#39;d suggest something like seeing 25-30 of them given to<br/>
&gt; guildmembers before you&#39;re allowed to roll for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a <br/>
&gt; guild of 150+<br/>
&gt; &gt; different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not many guilds on Karana with 150+ players.  ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the <br/>
&gt; leaders of the<br/>
&gt; guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need a haste<br/>
&gt; &gt; item. (even tho they stack)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Their reasoning is wrong - if you follow it through like I did<br/>
&gt; above, bards get the *most* melee benefit from haste items of<br/>
&gt; any class.  But for the other reasons I outlined above, I<br/>
&gt; pretty much have to side with them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, they damn well better be willing to break their backs to<br/>
&gt; teleport a bard up to air if a Belt of Concordance drops and<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s no bard present.<br/>
