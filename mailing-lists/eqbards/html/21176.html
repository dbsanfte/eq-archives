Well as you can tell we&#39;ve closed Test for a few days. What this means is<br/>
that me and my testers are working very hard and no one has time to devote<br/>
to the boards.<br/>
No I&#39;m not going to talk about it :P but once we&#39;re done I promise to get<br/>
back to business as usual.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience!!!<br/>
<br/>
oh this is the only time we ever forsee shutting down test server. I can<br/>
almost guarentee that it won&#39;t happen again for these reasons. I can&#39;t be<br/>
held accountable for hardware!!!</div>
