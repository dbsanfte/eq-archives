<div id="ygrps-yiv-126132484">Actually the Nybright sisters are no longer there.  A high level group troop <br/>
of Dark Elves (including a priestess who&#39;s at least level 45) has taken over <br/>
the Nybright camp.  A couple of us decided to try to take over the camp <br/>
(level 50+ wizzie, myself, and a couple of 50+ tanks, including a pally I <br/>
think) and had to evac.  The guards were easy enough (at level 40 or so) but <br/>
when we tried to pull the named priestess or whatever, they started to <br/>
respawn and she was healing herself, etc.<br/>

&gt;Another fun place is the Nybright sisters camp in Lesser Faydark,<br/>
&gt;near loc -800, +2500 (I think).  If you gather a dull pearl necklace<br/>
&gt;from each sister and give it to the drunkard in kelethin, you get<br/>
&gt;more exp and some item that sells for around 1pp.  The sisters drop a<br/>
&gt;lot of rusties and the occasional bronze weapon.  I would go over<br/>
&gt;there whenever I was getting bored in Steamfont.<br/>
