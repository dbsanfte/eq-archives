<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336680800"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Can you show me an example with your above formula to show how the <br/>
&gt; penalty would be moved?  I&#39;m don&#39;t grasp the concept you&#39;re stating <br/>
&gt; with just the formula.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I understand this now, and I believe we already have the <br/>
answer.  The previous exp penalty is not actually a penalty perse, by <br/>
this I mean that there is no actual exp being docked per kill.  Bards <br/>
would actually physically need 1400 exp points to level, rather than <br/>
1000.  Check with the people running ShowEQ to be sure.  The amount <br/>
of EXP their character is receiving is the same regardless of class.  <br/>
The EXP Bar is just larger.  Also, the way VI is introducing this <br/>
change is extremelly and confusing if they&#39;re using one table <br/>
and &quot;knocking off&quot; experience based on the classes.  Plus, I don&#39;t <br/>
see clearly how they (pre-patch) would divide the experience based <br/>
off how much experience you have, i.e. a Bard at level 40 would have <br/>
more than a Cleric at level 40.  From your suggestion, the Bard would <br/>
actually have the exact same amount, but it would have come from more <br/>
kills.<br/>
<br/>
If this is what you mean by the exp penalty COULD have been moved, <br/>
then I am confident that it&#39;s not.  I&#39;m pretty sure that they&#39;re <br/>
using seperate tables for each class/race combination rather than 1 <br/>
overall table by all the other evidence available to us.</div>
