<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508468009">I have played with my Enchanter friend for 41 levels (I am level 41 - ok so<br/>
maybe we got to level 6 solo but we been grouped a lot.)<br/>
<br/>
First off - a regular group is much preferred to pick-up groups.  You learn<br/>
about the other&#39;s abilities and don&#39;t have to teach everyone how to work<br/>
together each time.<br/>
<br/>
1. Over lap - yes somewhat.  This can be a good thing.  Bard Clarity and<br/>
Enchanter Clarity stack.  Enchanter&#39;s do crowd control better - freeing the<br/>
bard to use his other songs  now the party is getting buffs (Anthem &<br/>
Elemental) they would not get if the bard were doing the crowd control.   <br/>
<br/>
2.Imho, bard AE damage songs are for fighting 1 mob at a time.  As you gain<br/>
levels, I think you will find that the mobs get tougher and tougher.  You<br/>
won&#39;t want more than one agro (fighting) at any time - you wont be able to<br/>
absorb the damage they can dish out.  You will want an enchanter to mez the<br/>
extra mobs so you can fight them one at a time. If the bard in the party<br/>
needs to do crowd control, you won&#39;t be using your AE songs either.<br/>
<br/>
3.Hmm... &quot;Hi all!  41 bard here!  Pls say class level so I know what songs<br/>
to play.&quot;  Your invis would have killed the Shaman&#39;s pet too.   Best to<br/>
brief everyone and know who is gonna do what. Maybe it happened so fast<br/>
there was not time.  Unrest is the first &quot;hard&quot; dungeon players hit (ok,<br/>
Befallen is no slouch either) and are forced to learn how to work as a group<br/>
or die a lot and go back to somewhere &quot;safe&quot; like HighKeep.  One time in<br/>
Unrest a guy got rooted on the front porch and was about to be killed.  I<br/>
went over and got him un-rooted (pre-nerf to Selo&#39;s) and we hadda scramble<br/>
for the zone.  On the other side of the zone, he said to me: &quot;please don&#39;t<br/>
play any songs, they attract too many mobs...&quot;  I disbanded and left  them<br/>
because they we clueless and I was in no mood to try to teach them.  Partys<br/>
at the mid levels really need to understand how to work together and this<br/>
comes from understanding what the others in the group do.  You need to know<br/>
what class they are and who will do what.  Talk about it before the action<br/>
gets going.<br/>
<br/>
4. Can&#39;t comment.  You got all the bad ones I guess cause I got all the good<br/>
ones - sorry no trades :p<br/>
<br/>
When you get to the high level places - where you need multiple groups - you<br/>
will find that both bards and enchanters are welcomed and in fact pretty<br/>
much a requirement.  Even the places like Sol-B (35+ mobs and players) you<br/>
hear &quot;Nobel/King/Bat  room looking for another!  Bard or enchanter<br/>
preferred!!!&quot; <br/>

Hello all!  I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, and thought I&#39;d post on a<br/>
subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the incompatability of enchanters<br/>
and<br/>
bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game that work together as<br/>
poorly as these two?<br/>
<br/>
Problem 1: Overlapping duties.  Many Bard tasks can be done better by<br/>
Enchanters.  Crowd control, buffs, and mana regen are the big three.<br/>
<br/>
Problem 2: Enchanters make Bard AoE songs more or less useless.  Since so<br/>
many<br/>
of our songs are AoE, our playlist is more limited than a Los Angeles Top 40<br/>
FM station when grouping with an enchanter.  I&#39;ve just learned on this list<br/>
that Largo does NOT wake up mezzed mobs, so I&#39;m adding that back into my<br/>
&quot;Enchanter Hotkey&quot; bank.  That&#39;s good news.<br/>
<br/>
Problem 3: Bard invis song kills Enchanter pets / breaks charm.  Yeah, this<br/>
is<br/>
really the Bard&#39;s fault if they do this, and it can happen with other pet<br/>
and<br/>
charm classes too.  However, there is a unique problem with Enchanters.  The<br/>
other night I got into a group in Unrest by the fountains.  One of the group<br/>
members was a casting Troll.  &quot;Shaman,&quot; I thought to myself.  Suddenly, a<br/>
typical Unrest train comes roaring by bearing half the house.  I kick in the<br/>
invis song to protect the group when the message &quot;Gebaner slashes itself for<br/>
32000 points of damage&quot; pops up, followed by a severe reaming from the<br/>
Enchanter who was in troll form.<br/>
<br/>
Problem 4: For some reason, most Enchanters I&#39;ve grouped with are total<br/>
jackasses.  They are constantly barking orders (usually in all caps) and<br/>
yelling at everybody.  It&#39;s very rare for Enchanters to give instructions<br/>
ina<br/>
polite fashion, like &quot;Hey guys, please assist the puller so I can mez the<br/>
other mobs.&quot;  They are always self-congratualtory (&quot;Heh heh my ae mez rockz,<br/>
dOOd!&quot;) and showing off (&quot;Look, I&#39;m a table, d00dz!&quot; followed 1 minute later<br/>
by &quot;OOM&quot;).  They seem to be surly most of the time, I can&#39;t imagine them<br/>
having any fun with all their gripes.  And oh, if something goes wrong in<br/>
battle, it&#39;s NEVER their fault.  They point fingers all the time.  It&#39;s very<br/>
rare for an enchanter to say &quot;Sorry guys, I mezzed the wrong mob.&quot;  It&#39;s<br/>
usually &quot;My Mez wore off that mob!!!  Somebody must have attacked it!<br/>
Idiots!<br/>
It was probably one of those retarded bard songs!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, Enchanters are a great class.  They can enable any group<br/>
to handle mobs that would be unattainable otherwise.  And there are some<br/>
good<br/>
apples in the bunch who can play their role well without being a jerk.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have any tips on how a Bard and Enchanter can group together<br/>
successfully and work with each other rather against?  Right now, whenever<br/>
an<br/>
enchanter is in my group, I feel like an underpowered tank, which is not a<br/>
fun<br/>
role to play.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
