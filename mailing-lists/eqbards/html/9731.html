<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523869409">i&#39;ve never heard of the carapace being dropped in MM.... Reguarding getting<br/>
to the piano room. dont go to the secret room, go to the main entrance of<br/>
the castle, you can invis the whole way to to the room and nothing will agro<br/>
you (not me anyways). Once you go in, you have to go into the middle hall<br/>
then take the first right (something like that)  its hard to explain, easier<br/>
to show as i&#39;ve only been there 2 times<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have also followed a similar strategy to acquire the quest components.<br/>
&gt; So<br/>
&gt; far I have eight pieces but have yet to find anyone selling a lambent<br/>
&gt; stone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the past two weeks, I have been hanging out in MM trying to get a<br/>
&gt; lute.<br/>
&gt; I guess my timing has been bad because the times I have been online, none<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the higher level characters are camping the music room where the gypsies<br/>
&gt; spawn.  As a 26th level bard, the furthest into MM I have gone is the<br/>
&gt; courtyard and the secret room with four doors near the graveyard.  I know<br/>
&gt; where the secret walls are that lead up into the castle but have not dared<br/>
&gt; to go any further (I assume that mobs will see through my invis song if I<br/>
&gt; go<br/>
&gt; upstairs).  Would appreciate it if someone can give me directions to the<br/>
&gt; music(piano) room from the secret room just in case someone finds a gypsy<br/>
&gt; lute and is willing to give it away or sell the looting rights. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many times while camping besides the lake, massive trains will go by<br/>
&gt; heading<br/>
&gt; to the zone.  I&#39;ve sat there and watched to see if any gypsies are part of<br/>
&gt; the train.  So far there haven&#39;t been any.  I am beginning to believe that<br/>
&gt; parties have no incentive to camp the music room if a bard isn&#39;t in the<br/>
&gt; party.  As a result, I am contemplating leaving MM and only returning when<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; am 32d level.  At that point, I can offer to be a mana bard in exchange<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; the parties agreeing to help me get the gypsy lute.  I think that is<br/>
&gt; probably the best course of action because I can&#39;t get the lambent<br/>
&gt; breastplate until I also get the basalt carapace.  Once again, my chances<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; finding a party to help me get the basalt carapace are much better if I<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; sing the mana song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One last thing concerning the basalt carapace.  Last night in MM another<br/>
&gt; bard was auctioning to purchase looting rights for a basalt carapace.  I<br/>
&gt; told him that they were found on the gargoyles in Lower Guk.  He told me<br/>
&gt; that they could also be looted off the tougher gargoyles in MM.  I have<br/>
&gt; never heard of anyone getting a basalt carapace in MM.   Can anyone<br/>
&gt; confirm<br/>
&gt; if this is a possibility.  I do know for a fact that the black silk gloves<br/>
&gt; are dropped by mobs other than the deathly usher.  I have personally seen<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; deathly aegis and a deathly harbinger drop the gloves.  I guess its<br/>
&gt; possible<br/>
&gt; that the basalt carapace can be dropped by mobs other than those told to<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; by the quest giver in Solusek temple.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually I have been hunting parts for lambent armor since it where<br/>
&gt; added.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Until now I have:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 lambent stone, bought for 30pp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 Shin greavers<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 Shin gauntlets<br/>
&gt; &gt; I looted the shin stuff in LGuk with help of some of my higher level<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends/guild, but I would not think that it would be to hard to get<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; just going there and waiting. Got the gaunts from another person who did<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; /shout Gaunts to loot at entrance.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 Dark bracelet (sp?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Dark bracelet was aquired during my normal fighting in Unrest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Currently I am trying to get the Icy greavers, but my main problem is<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; one on Bertox seems to hunt in Perma during my normal playing hours<br/>
&gt; &gt; (evenings<br/>
&gt; &gt; CET around 8-12PST), but getting to king room is not a problem if<br/>
&gt; someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; keeping the area around the first gate clear. Anyone else notice that<br/>
&gt; &gt; invisio<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems to fail EVERY time you get near it (Atleast it did when I was 23<br/>
&gt; &gt; havent<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried at 24 yet)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well I was in one group who camped the king room for some time and it<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; tough to hold for a group of level 23-30 or so people with the right<br/>
&gt; &gt; pulling<br/>
&gt; &gt; strategi.<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I get the icy&#39;s I will be of to MM again to try and get the gloves<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; lute. Or maybe the karanas to get a griffene charm.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So dont give up. You can get the stuff with a bit of help. Just give<br/>
&gt; &gt; yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt; time to get to know the zones where the items is - and how to get there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Using your invisio song you can go far in on your own to get the loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
