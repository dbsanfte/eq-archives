<b>Subject:</b> level 32 and not sure! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-996512518">Im level 32 now! Not too sure where to fight or what to kill. If any one has<br/>
any clue that would be great. To be honest I know of lower guk, but I hate<br/>
that place with a passion!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was told that High hold keep would be good in the warriors room, fighting<br/>
pickclaws?  I dont know my way in HHK at all. I am on Innourkk server. Can<br/>
any one show me the way there or another spot to fight? Or some detailed<br/>
info :) thanks all........</div>
