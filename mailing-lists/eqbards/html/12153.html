<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374430681">First of all your observation on the linkage between the mobs is correct.<br/>
It has always been that way. And that has made it one of the more<br/>
challenging places to fite. Trains - ya Paw has always had trains when more<br/>
people used to play there.  So you made it to the double doors?  Wooo hoo!<br/>
Those doors are the land mark I used to use for knowing I was about to<br/>
safely zone.  Relative to the rest of the place - that is about _maybe_ 5<br/>
percent of the dungeon (from zone to double doors.)  Maybe 10 percent of the<br/>
physical length of the place.  And there are lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
Past those double doors is a room with some guards and an overhead ramp that<br/>
can have mobs too. Past that room is the first bridge.  You would have to<br/>
clear 4 or more mobs to cross it. Hehe, but you don&#39;t have to cross it - you<br/>
can jump off of it!  Now days - try not to land in the water cause there are<br/>
agro snakes in the water now - blue to me at 37/38.  More gnolls below.<br/>
More rooms with gnolls. And then there is the old shaman&#39;s rooms.  This is a<br/>
spot where the old Paw named shaman&#39;s would spawn.  You had to fite your way<br/>
in here for a Runed Totem Staff or a Skull of J&#39;hnTrvlta.  Not sure what the<br/>
drop is here these days but there is a steep flight of stairs going up into<br/>
a set of rooms - you charge up and bust open the doors and fite both rooms<br/>
at once.  We had a party of 11 in 2 groups - a 50, 2 44/45, a 40,  and some<br/>
misc 30&#39;s.  Woo Hoo this one&#39;s a Necro - ouchie!  So now you can camp here<br/>
but later you gotta fite your way out - or evac now that you got higher<br/>
level spells and powers.  <br/>
<br/>
Or if you don&#39;t jump, you can go further in and fite some more guards and<br/>
such.  Soon you come to a series of doors.  One of the will lead you to the<br/>
prison section and this is where you went for various quests.  It has levers<br/>
to open jail doors and you had to go into a cell for a quest and the doors<br/>
would close behind you.  And if you tried it solo - you were trapped!!!<br/>
Yikes NO WAY OUT!!! Or is there a secret lever??? Hehe - do you remember the<br/>
panic of being trapped in a cell at level 9? <br/>
<br/>
The other doors lead to various other sections of rooms with commanders and<br/>
nobles (in the old days - not sure what is in here now.)  And one route lead<br/>
you to the second bridge.  This one was populated by 3 groups of gnolls.<br/>
The center group was 6 shamans.  When you attacked the others the shamans<br/>
would heal and buff the others.  Don&#39;t you just hate that when you beat a<br/>
mob to half hp and all of a sudden his hp is back to ´┐¢?  <br/>
<br/>
Past this place was another section that was a maze of walls that once you<br/>
found you way to the back was on of the big dungeon bosses G&#39;hanex Drah -<br/>
bad necro gnoll. Wonder if the new bosses are staged here.  He was guarded<br/>
by zombies that would agro on you through closed doors and agro the whole<br/>
room.  He had a re-incarnate that would spawn somewhere and you had to be<br/>
fast to catch him.  <br/>
<br/>
In the other section, there was a certain named sha that if you killed him<br/>
would spawn a named DE Necro who would roam the whole dungeon agro on<br/>
everyone. Later he was changed to a DE Wizzie.  I keep looking out on the<br/>
plains for the named one that spawns him.  Wonder if they moved that AI<br/>
outside or if the inside mobs have a really nasty surprise in-store for<br/>
visitors?<br/>
<br/>
Paw was never good for casual pick up groups.  You need 2 partys working<br/>
together to handle the place. Or be high level such that they don&#39;t agro on<br/>
you even though you are fighting their buddys 3 feet away.  Runnyeye has the<br/>
same level linked agro behavior.  Paw when you are co-level with the mobs<br/>
(or even when they are blue to you) is a hard place.  Fight you way in and<br/>
either fight your way out - or get gated.  Mobs that are linked and work<br/>
together to fight you.  hard yes - but good hard IMHO. <br/>
<br/>
For me there is more to explore there.  <br/>
<br/>
Sylly Songsynger<br/>
&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>
Bard of the 39th song<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I need at least 2 good groups - wanna come?<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. there is a route that when you are fighting your way out or running<br/>
out that takes you to that top ramp in the room with the double doors.  You<br/>
can just hop down click the doors, hot key train to zone and you are on your<br/>
way &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

		Greetings!<br/>
		Spent a whole night in the new Paw, and thought I would<br/>
share my experiences <br/>
		with everyone.  I was only in the old Paw twice, so I had a<br/>
sketchy idea of <br/>
		it (not like some folks who know it inside out).  The first<br/>
thing i noticed, <br/>
		was that the layout of the dungeon is awkward for more than<br/>
two groups to <br/>
		use in the first section.  The first section is what I<br/>
consider to be up to <br/>
		the double doors.  There are 2 places to setup a base, one<br/>
being much safer <br/>
		as it is off the main tunnel to the zone.  The gnolls are<br/>
linked was the <br/>
		second thing I noticed.  Attack a certain one and you may<br/>
get 3.  Even if <br/>
		the other 2 were out of sight.  There is a low level caster<br/>
in the 1st <br/>
		portion that casts fear and charm( I tore up a tank with<br/>
anthem locked on <br/>
		and 2 fast weapons).</div>
