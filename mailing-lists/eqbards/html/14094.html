  I had a blast last night in Mistmoore.  And despite the very<br/>
  crappy loot and server crash, I had a great time in Hate this<br/>
  weekend.  I&#39;m trying to make do, but I&#39;m coming back to the friends<br/>
  not so much the gameplay anymore.  Soon, me and those friends will<br/>
  find something else to do I imagine.  Verant just needs to address <br/>
  the now and stop promising us the future.  If I felt they were <br/>
  spending the resources to upkeep the game and it&#39;s playerbase<br/>
  I&#39;d support them a whole lot more.<br/>
