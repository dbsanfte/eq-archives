<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hmm, let&#39;s formalize this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You have B hp, mob has M hp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Your songs do S damage/sec, mob does D damage/sec to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Your songs heal you at H hp/sec.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Your survival time is your hp divided by the damage you take<br/>
&gt;per sec plus the hp you heal per sec.  ts = B/(D-H)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Time to kill a mob is tk = (M/S).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ratio of kill time to survival time, R = tk/ts, determines<br/>
&gt;outcome.  If R &gt; 1, you die.  If R &lt; 1, you win.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;R = (M/S)/(B/(D-H)) = M(D-H)/SB = MD/SB - MH/SB<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;R&#39; = M(D-1.2H)/1.2SB = MD/1.2SB - MH/SB<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;R&#39; = R - 0.167MD/SB<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So the kill time to survival time curve is shifted down by an<br/>
&gt;amount -0.167MD/SB.  In other words, you can barely kill stuff<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s about 17% harder.  However the easier the stuff is to<br/>
&gt;kill (the lower the tk/ts ratio), the proportionately better<br/>
&gt;off you&#39;ll be, approaching infinitely better at 0.167MD/SB (at<br/>
&gt;which point you lose no hp during the fight).  The healing<br/>
&gt;bonus becomes a non-factor since the extra healing rate is<br/>
&gt;exactly canceled out by the reduced time to kill a mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So against barely-killable mobs, the 7-string lute is 17% more<br/>
&gt;effective.  But the more easily killed the mob is, the<br/>
&gt;7-string lute becomes more and more effective, approaching<br/>
&gt;infinity (the point where your hp doesn&#39;t go down with a<br/>
&gt;7-string lute, but you still lose hp with a normal lute).<br/>
