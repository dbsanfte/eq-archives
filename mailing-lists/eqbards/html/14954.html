<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388355171">Are you certain mobs seeing thru your Invis song wasn&#39;t due to lag?  Invis<br/>
song combined with lag is known to cause you to appear, usually at times<br/>
most inconvenient to the bard.<br/>

&gt;     Speaking of Clouding - it has been failing big time lately by Mobs<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; are now green to me in Mistmoore.  When I was in my mid-to-upper 20&#39;s - I<br/>
&gt; could sing it and get from the zone to the Graveyard completely<br/>
&gt; unmolested.<br/>
&gt; The Initiates and what have you that spawn along the way would never be a<br/>
&gt; problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Starting a couple weeks ago - they would go agro on me when singing<br/>
&gt; Clouding and when Regular (not Superior) Camouflage is cast on me.  This<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; a major train generator.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     It seems to me they upgraded these mobs see invis.  Someone I grouped<br/>
&gt; with theorized that some wandering mob casts see invis on them - but who<br/>
&gt; knows?<br/>
