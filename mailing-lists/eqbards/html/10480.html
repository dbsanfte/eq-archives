<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150156824"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Permafrost, Runnyeye or Sol A might be ok. I didn&#39;t go to any of them<br/>
&gt; quite that early, but the goblins at the entrance were green to me when<br/>
<br/>
&gt; However, if you haven&#39;t got a regular group yet, none of these dungeons<br/>
&gt; is likely to be all that useful. The best place I found on my server to<br/>
&gt; find pick up groups, where I eventually met people I ended up grouping<br/>
&gt; with into the late 40&#39;s was Unrest. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yikes!  I tried Unrest at 18 and 19 and got into some of the worst groups I<br/>
have ever seen.  The groups were far more horrifying than the mobs.  Get<br/>
this, one group I was in, the cleric had the following spells memm&#39;d at<br/>
level 17.  Summon food, Summon drink, Hammer of Wrath, Smite, Furor, Light<br/>
Heal! and that&#39;s it!  I know from the screenshot he emailed me of his<br/>
&quot;awesome kill of a horrid undead via his amazing Smite spell&quot;  I get the<br/>
shivers every time I think of Unrest now, not from the mobs, just from the<br/>
pathetic groups I was in there.  Verrrry  scary.  The close, but still<br/>
second worst, was the 19th level magician who insisted on tanking right up<br/>
there with his pet and pulling &quot;cause he was the highest level and would get<br/>
less trash&quot;  I have never seen more bodies, nor greater reason for there to<br/>
be bodies in any zone I&#39;ve been too except for the one time during the great<br/>
Squad Ring Massacre in Rivervale square.  There were at least 50 bodies<br/>
there, of course they all belonged to the same six people.<br/>

	greatly afeared of the PC&#39;s in Unrest<br/>
	&quot;Can&#39;t I just group with that dark-boned skeleton? <br/>
	He&#39;s getting great xp soloing yellows...&quot;<br/>
