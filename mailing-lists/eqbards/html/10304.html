<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649155107">This is odd, but I can think of two reasons why you might now have been able<br/>
to dual wield just after your 17th &quot;ding&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One is that perhaps you were trying to put a weapon into your secondary slot<br/>
that is primary only.  Since I assume you know that I consider it to be<br/>
least likely.  More likely is that you needed to zone and come back for you<br/>
new skills to be visible to the client.  Just how when you&#39;re learning a<br/>
language you have to zone to see the skill level.<br/>

&gt;    Since I asked about dual weild just a few days ago, I have received<br/>
&gt; wonderful amounts of useful information and advice from you all.<br/>
&gt; Thank you<br/>
&gt; all very much for teaching me the ways of weaving and chain/fear&#39;ing and<br/>
&gt; other assorted fight and merchanting techniques.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    It&#39;s strange though for me how it came up. I was in Lava or<br/>
&gt; Najena at the<br/>
&gt; time with a full group. I was in no particular hurry to get back to the<br/>
&gt; guild to train or anything, but when I attempted to equip two<br/>
&gt; melee weapons,<br/>
&gt; I could not. I was like ok, I do indeed have to go train on it - no big<br/>
&gt; deal. Upon arriving to that guy outside the bard guild in Freeport, I<br/>
&gt; scrolled down to my skill to start the basics of. Amazingly enough, I saw<br/>
&gt; that they would charge me 1pp and something to train. WOW no thanks I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; talk to you later!! LOL When I went back to fight I was able to<br/>
&gt; weild both<br/>
&gt; hands with a weapon. So no harm done, only a little confusion. =)<br/>
&gt;    I just thought I&#39;d mention it.<br/>
