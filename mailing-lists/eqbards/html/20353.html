 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had great fun on the northeast shore of the Lake of Ill Omen from<br/>
level 13-17 grouped with one other.  Having recently moved to a new<br/>
server (translate: starting over AGAIN) I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be visiting<br/>
there again in the near future.  The pit in the Field of Bone is also<br/>
fun, but a long run from Firiona Vie.  I&#39;ve only been in the basement<br/>
of the tower there once, at level 16, and had a great time.<br/>
<br/>
My current plan for my new bard is to stay in Crushbone till level 9,<br/>
then head over to Steamfont and fight the skellies around the gears. <br/>
As I get a little higher, I&#39;ll stick my head into the caves once in a<br/>
while to get a Mino slaver.  Once I get 13 I&#39;ll head to Kunark.<br/>

finally worked.)</div>
