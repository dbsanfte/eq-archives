&gt;Several reasons. Our troll shaman can be small without wasting mana. We can<br/>

&gt;reasons non bard types like the mask. A warning on the mask though. If the<br/>
&gt;illusion fails while you are singing ( it lasts approx 15 minutes before<br/>
&gt;saying your about to look like yourself again) what ever song you were<br/>
&gt;singing will be jammed. I have only been able to unjam it by camping or<br/>
&gt;zoning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ladies and gents who experience this problem (I never have, so I can&#39;t test<br/>
it). There is a new command implemented, called /stopsong.<br/>
I posted it on usenet, along with all the other / commands.  In test, it<br/>
stopped my song exactly as if I had hit the button again.  My guess is,<br/>
this is an emergency fix for the &quot;jammed&quot; occurence.<br/>
PLEASE test this, and verify if it works.<br/>
