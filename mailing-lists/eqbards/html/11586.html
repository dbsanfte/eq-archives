&gt;I have a problem with obtaining lambent stones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying to cash in<br/>
&gt;on lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>
&gt;cheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>
&gt;saying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>
&gt;refuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent over 1000pp<br/>
&gt;purchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not going to<br/>

higher levels in a GM run event.  They were very beat up and needed healing<br/>
to avoid missing the rest of the event.  All the clerics were oom from<br/>
nuking undead and healing during the fight so they were very grateful.  I<br/>
have seen them for sale on vendors as well, notably in W Karana.  Vendors<br/>
sell them for about 40pp at best price.<br/>
