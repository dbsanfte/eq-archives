<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913041682">My tip(s) for you in any planes raid involving multi-mob pulls is to hold <br/>
off on singing until extra mobs are under control. The extras love to go for <br/>
bards and will put you under fast. Don&#39;t be in puller group (ever). Normally <br/>
we will have a puller group, CC group (crowd control), and caster group. <br/>
Puller is all tanks + cleric + monk puller. CC group is all enchanters <br/>
(usually 2 or 3) + cleric + tank (to taunt mobs off enchanters while they <br/>
mez stuff) + a druid or sham. Caster group is obvious. Cleric if possible in <br/>
with casters, otherwise use druids/shaman should be ok if nukers aren&#39;t dumb <br/>
and nuke too early. Bards are in any group but pull group.<br/>
<br/>
Poison resist helping with Maestro is a myth IMO. Our fave Maestro strategy <br/>
is to have a high level warrior tank the shit out of it with everyone else <br/>
on Maestro&#39;s backside to avoid the brunt of his lifetap proc (theories on <br/>
this abound, but we believe it is cone-shaped from the his frontside). You <br/>
want big nukes for this guy. Have nukers engage around 60% and drop him or <br/>
at least get him to fleeing. Maestro should be pretty pissed at the original <br/>
tank by then. If your casters nuke too early he will ping pong all over and <br/>
generally rape your nukers and clerics, lifetapping everyone in the process. <br/>
As a bard, I found that instead of meleeing or singing resists, the best <br/>
thing for me to do was to continually sing Jonothan&#39;s Provocation with a <br/>
horn on the main tank. Worked like a charm. We killed Maestro w/18 ppl <br/>
tonight (not to mention the rest of Hate).<br/>
<br/>
If you are meleeing, never use your autoattack key. For the time that you <br/>
are in the planes, forget that your autoattack key exists. =) Always always <br/>
use only your assist key. You shouldn&#39;t be swinging your weapon unless you <br/>
hit the assist key.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, if you are in Fear and Cazic Thule is up, good luck not getting <br/>
deathtouched. Bards have it bad there. =( Bards are kick ass pullers though, <br/>
when Cazic is dead. Any mobs that can cause you to be deathtouched you <br/>
should hold off on singing til maybe halfway thru the fight. This includes <br/>
Dread, Terror, Fright, Dracolich, and Cazic. Even then expect to eat DT. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I am almost ready for some plane hunting myself, and should be <br/>
&gt;going<br/>
&gt; &gt; up in early November.  I have seen various bards comment about not <br/>
&gt;singing<br/>
&gt; &gt; during pulls etc. while in the planes, but what I would really like is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; synopis of &quot;bard tactics&quot; while in Fear, Hate and Sky.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A few of you guys up for the task?  Anyone...Anyone.....<br/>
