<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154221428">Then _WHY_ in Rodcet Nife&#39;s green earth did he _NOT_ make the female<br/>
bards dance ?! Which dance more, females or males, as a general rule ?!<br/>
<br/>
Danngit, I wanna dance! I felt SOOOOOOOOO gypped at 18 when I played my<br/>
horn and flute like a silly saxaphone (and backwards to boot!), while my<br/>
level 22 MALE bard friend giggled and danced a circle around me =(<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who quit their level 9 bard becuase the only reason she<br/>
wanted a bard was so that she could dance....<br/>

&gt; TSC: Alright, now time to take that mask off... What class/race are you<br/>
