<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476013680">I was mostly just curious as to what zone and guessed Karnors since so many<br/>
are camping that place.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is after 51 levels you&#39;d think these train monkies would have<br/>
learned how to pull - but no.  The same &quot;names&quot; that are pulling the trains<br/>
in Karnors are the ones we saw training the zone in SolB, Lower G, CT,<br/>
Unrest, Befallen, Old Paw, Blackburrow & Crunchbone.<br/>

&gt; If I&#39;m understand your message, you are asking where the Knight is? :).<br/>
