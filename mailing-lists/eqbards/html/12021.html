&gt; &gt;I was perusing a Shaman mail list and found out they think THEY are<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot;. I wounder how many other classes<br/>
&gt; &gt;have been to this? :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; WIZARDS, OTOH, complain that the jack of all trades can do their mastery<br/>
&gt; as well as they can.<br/>

Shamen cannot help mana regen or cast a damage shield or provide a snare<br/>

Bards are the only real jacks of all trades.</div>
