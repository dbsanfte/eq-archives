<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154946295">I&#39;ve been trying to give my bard some method of magical attacks to<br/>
supplement his dissonance (I&#39;m currently level 11 -- can&#39;t wait until<br/>
I get below).<br/>
<br/>
So, questions:<br/>
<br/>
1.  How much does dissonance with and without the lute/mandolin<br/>
    at each level?  I&#39;ve heard 16 damage at level 30, but that<br/>
    doesn&#39;t help when you&#39;re having a hard time getting up to<br/>
    20 in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
2.  I took the very long trip to Innothule and spent a few hours<br/>
    killing frogloks for netted armor.  Now, mind you, I made a<br/>
    pretty good profit selling all the rusty weapons I could haul<br/>
    to Oasis, and I have an almost complete set of netted armor<br/>
    to auction off.  But I thought that having netted gloves<br/>
    (which are magical) would let me fight hand to hand against<br/>
    magic-only monsters.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Are there any weapons/armor out there that we can use as bards<br/>
    to supplement our instrumental damage songs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance.</div>
