<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] How much more group xp should there be? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-358723398">Heres something you didn&#39;t take into account:<br/>
<br/>
The time to kill mob + the time to recover mana/hp to kill the next mob.<br/>
<br/>
Also, most places where people solo are minimal xp zones (IE outdoors).<br/>
With a good group you should (assuming you want xp) you should go to a more<br/>
difficult, and higher xp zone.  From my personal experience I would estimate<br/>
there is up to a 20% xp bonus in some dungeons.  (FYI the ones that seemd to<br/>
have the highest modifier to me are Unrest, Mistmoore, Dalinars and Kaesora.<br/>
Guk gets an honorable mention because I think the mobs there are very weak<br/>
for their level, thus yield good xp despite the zone bonus seeming not as<br/>
good)<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 31, in a 5 hour night in Dalinars, I have gotten 6 bubs of xp! (Group<br/>
size was 4-6 people)  Was it a freak occurence?  Nope, got a little more<br/>
than 5 the next week (in the same 5 hour span)..  Both nights, every person<br/>
in our group dinged (not all were there all the time), it was pretty<br/>
amazing.  They tried out Nurga this week without me, I&#39;ll see next week how<br/>
good it is...</div>
