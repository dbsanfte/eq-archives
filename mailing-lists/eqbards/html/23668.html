<div id="ygrps-yiv-16867238">Excluding recent Resurrections - it happened to me fighting at the zone out<br/>
of Chardok.  The mobs have a lot of XP and we weren&#39;t tank heavy - so it<br/>
took a while to take them down.  Note that I had been fighting there for<br/>
like four hours or something (maybe longer this a while ago so I don&#39;t<br/>
recall exactly) before getting into this situation.<br/>

Anyone else ever been in a situation when they almost ran out of mana due to<br/>
charming (and not when soloing using charm kiting)?<br/>
