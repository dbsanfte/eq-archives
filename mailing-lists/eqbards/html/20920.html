<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Mine was a 6 hour camp. Maximumeq lists the spawn time<br/>
&gt; of the assasin at 29 minutes (in the comments<br/>
&gt; section).  But that is incorrect (and my wife is very<br/>
&gt; pissed off at me this morning for all the time I spent<br/>
&gt; camping that thing...)  Point here is, have a pot of<br/>
&gt; coffee on, you may be luckier than me, but the assasin<br/>
&gt; is a rare spawn. </span></blockquote></div>
