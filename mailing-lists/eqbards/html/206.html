<b>Subject:</b> Speaking of outrunning Selo&#39;s <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-380279713">A word of warning for any bards looking to play in the Oasis of Marr area,<br/>
Lockjaw the crocodile is the only creature I have seen in EQ thus far that can<br/>
outrun a healthy bard with Selo&#39;s going.  I&#39;m sure there are others, but this<br/>
was the only one I have seen.<br/>
<br/>
To quantify a little:<br/>
<br/>
- I have tangled with Lockjaw twice (died once, zoned the other time only<br/>
because I was very close)<br/>
- I was healthy both times (no slow down because of low health)<br/>
- I did not have a drum in my hand in either case<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps with a drum in hand you could outrun this nasty lizard, but I doubt it.<br/>
If anyone wants to go try running from him with and without a drum, be my guest.<br/>
