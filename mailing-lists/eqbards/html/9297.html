- Charm spells now message the message [should read &quot;player&quot;?] when they<br/>

Perhaps the new patch will help me, but I have a very difficult time with<br/>
Charm.  I&#39;ve played with it in East Commonlands against the orcs there and<br/>
just can&#39;t seem to get the hang of knowing when to recharm the mob.<br/>
Switching between targetting my charmed mob and the one I&#39;m fighting is<br/>
extremely difficult since I can&#39;t seem to get F1 to work as advertised for<br/>
switching pet/mob.  I have to either click on the mob or adjust my position<br/>
and use &quot;target closest NPC&quot; to switch - both of which are tricky at best.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me at a dissertation on this subject other than what I&#39;ve<br/>
read here or is it just practice, practice, practice?<br/>
