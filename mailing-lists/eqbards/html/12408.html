deceptively difficult problem to solve.<br/>
<br/>
The 0.00000625 (or 1 in 160,000) is the chance of 4 failures<br/>
given only 4 attempts.  If you go up to 5 attempts, the chance<br/>
of getting 4 consecutive failures is 1 in 82,051.<br/>
<br/>
atmpts  odds<br/>
   4    1 in 160,000<br/>
   5    1 in  82,051<br/>
   6    1 in  55,172<br/>
   7    1 in  41,558 <br/>
   8    1 in  33,333<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, after 8, the permutations start to repeat, and<br/>
I wasn&#39;t able to figure out a pattern to it.  (&quot;Consecutive&quot;<br/>
is the monkey wrench - if you do more than 8 attempts, it&#39;s<br/>
possible to have multiple occurrances of 4 consecutive<br/>
failures) But as you can see, the odds do get better rather<br/>
quickly.  Given you probably stop/start songs a couple hundred<br/>
times each time you play, and have been playing the game for<br/>
over half a year now, I wouldn&#39;t consider seeing one string of<br/>
4 consecutive failures on a maxed skill to be unusual.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to use this problem as a brain teaser on my<br/>
friends...  :)<br/>
