<b>Subject:</b> Help with some Occlusion of Sound (55) numbers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019857686">I&#39;m trying to put together some numbers for OoS in my spreadsheet, <br/>
and I&#39;m getting contradictory information (sigh).<br/>
<br/>
Here are the values I have:<br/>
<br/>
The data file says it goes from 10 to 20 -MR/HR/CR<br/>
<br/>
level 55 sung = -10 MR/FR/CR (I thought it couldn&#39;t be sung *boggle*)<br/>
level 56 with hand drum: -26 MR/FR/CR<br/>
level 60 with Selo&#39;s drum = -23 MR/FR/CR<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve heard reports that this damages a mob, and other resports <br/>
saying it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve heard a report that it pushes the mob (moves it the <br/>
direction you are facing).<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone please confirm or deny the above, and/or provide numbers?  <br/>
What I want to know is this:<br/>
1) Can it be sung?<br/>
2) Does it push?<br/>
3) Does it have a damage component?<br/>
4) Some numbers please?  Preferably with a hand drum, but I&#39;ll take <br/>
anything ;)  Ideally, with all the drums you have ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your help with this!<br/>
<br/>
