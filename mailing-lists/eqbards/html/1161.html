&gt;I&#39;m a lvl 15 bard and i&#39;m looking for a great place to make a lot of cash, <br/>
&gt;plus get some exp.  Do any of you higher lvl bards know of a good place.  I <br/>
&gt;need the cash to start upgrading my armor and to buy a combined long sword. <br/>
&gt;  I appreciate any reply...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, there are many places to hunt at your level, but it would be helpful <br/>
to know where you are on Norrath.<br/>
If I was 15th and on Faydwer i&#39;d probably try Unrest, or maybe some of the <br/>
higher level orcs in Crushbone (must be careful there though, i got waxed by <br/>
a recently-trained Dvinn twice last night while he was &quot;stuck&quot; near the zone <br/>
border).<br/>
Near Freeport I like to hunt in the desert. Also Befallen might get you some <br/>
xp/loot, but I personally despise the place. It&#39;s really a cleric&#39;s dream <br/>
come true though i think. Guk might also have something for you, though i <br/>
haven&#39;t been there since beta4.<br/>
Near Qeynos I&#39;d probably be in Blackburrow hunting gnoll guardsmen, elites, <br/>
and commanders.<br/>
Near Erudin you could try Kerra Isle.<br/>
Also some good hunting in the Karanas, just watch out for griffons, hill <br/>
giants, and cyclopses, among other things (seen werewolves in East Karana <br/>
after nightfall, they probably roam the other Karanas too).<br/>
