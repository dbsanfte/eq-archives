<div id="ygrps-yiv-964843878">Back in August or so they patched so that Bards got magic attacks from magic<br/>
gloves like monks because we use hand to hand so much.  I wish they&#39;d raise<br/>
our H2H cap as well.  I&#39;d much rather have a 200 skill in H2H than in say...<br/>
1hb with as often as I use all instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my group was camping the frenzy so some of our warriors could get<br/>
a sash (I&#39;ve had mine since 37th) and all we had for healing was a druid.  I<br/>
went all-instrument (HoR, Celerity, Largos, CoD) Lute only (didn&#39;t feel like<br/>
bouncing instruments around and we had 4 melee&#39;ers so celerity was better<br/>
than another DOT)<br/>
<br/>
With that combination our druid had to heal 1 maybe 2 times during any given<br/>
fight even the BT&#39;s weren&#39;t bad.<br/>
<br/>
Bards use H2H second only to Monks.  I really wish Verant would raise our<br/>
skill cap in it.  I capped H2H LONG before I capped 1hs/pierce/1hb in any<br/>
given level after 18th.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Wisps are magic only to hit, but in a an all song<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack, that&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; &gt; a problem. (try to pick up magic gloves though so you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; punch the wisps)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Err, you&#39;re talking like mesh gloves right?  I thought only monks could<br/>
use<br/>
&gt; those as magic attacks and that for the rest of us they were just a light<br/>
&gt; weight glove.  Am I wrong?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Peace,<br/>
&gt; Evulia, who gave her mesh gloves to her monk not too long ago...<br/>
