<div id="ygrps-yiv-72694891">Trains in Sol B?  Woohoo!  Even during primetime on Fennin Ro we get the<br/>
group way back in the bugs that decides to try the Noxious Spider (aka Nox),<br/>
or the Stone Spider.  More often than not they run for the zone in the end<br/>
with a train of Sonic Bats, Lava Beetles and Lava Duct Crawlers on their<br/>
tails.  For the people that haven&#39;t been there, or that aren&#39;t yet high<br/>
enough level to fight in Sol B, this is A SINGLE FRIGGIN&#39; SPIDER that can<br/>
send a group in their high forties running for the zone - Ice Comet just<br/>
pisses him off.<br/>
