&gt;So what is Diku code?  First time I&#39;ve ever heard that term thrown out in<br/>
&gt;regards to Everquest.<br/>

&quot;Hallmarks of DIKU muds include: adventure, advancement, and combat. DIKU <br/>
mud first appeared in mid-March 1990. A group of programmers in the <br/>
Computer Science Department at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark <br/>
wanted to create an automated system for fantasy role playing. The driving <br/>
force behind the development derived from the inadequacies of AmberMUD. <br/>
AmberMUD source code could not handle many players, was inefficient on <br/>
computer resources, and tended towards smaller world environments. The <br/>
popularity of the DIKU source code has spawned many variants.  Many DIKUs <br/>
are quickly approaching uniqueness compared with their predecessor. Names <br/>
including: Circle, Merc, Copper, Sequent, Silly, and Epic head the list of <br/>
freely available modified DIKU source code.   Many programmers have <br/>
modified original DIKU source beyond  recognition compared to the original <br/>
DIKU code. Although the look and feel may be similar to the original DIKU <br/>
format, the game engine itself is usually quite different. Names including: <br/>
Sojourn, Medieva, Mozart, Mystic, Forbidden Lands, and Perilous Realms head <br/>
the list of these custom muds. &quot;<br/>
