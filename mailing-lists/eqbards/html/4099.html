<div id="ygrps-yiv-80943898"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Second, 250pp is not 250,000. Yes, that will buy you a set of bronze, but it<br/>

&gt; is &lt;G&gt;) or a battle drum. It&#39;s not exactly a godly plate of the whale-<br/>
&gt; actually, every one of my characters after the first have made at least a<br/>
&gt; hundred pp by level 15 (fairly, I might add, without using any trade skills<br/>
&gt; or even camping for lore items like everyone else), and some have gotten<br/>
&gt; much more than that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is precisely why I&#39;d suggest keeping the crown. 250pp is NOT that<br/>
much. You can make that cash if you really want it -- however a crown is<br/>
worth a lot. As someone else said, it&#39;s on the border of being one of<br/>
those things that is only traded and not sold.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a rule of trading that I learned: Never trade a rare drop for a<br/>
common drop. Yes, there are exceptions, but this almost always holds true.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the common drop is from a monster 10 levels higher, it&#39;s usually<br/>
not worth it. Because there&#39;s almost always a surplus of common drops<br/>
produced whenever someone camps for a rare drop, meaning the value of the<br/>
item is much much lower.<br/>
<br/>
So, don&#39;t trade your crown (rare drop) for cash (which you&#39;d use to buy<br/>
common things, like bronze and dragoon dirks).<br/>
