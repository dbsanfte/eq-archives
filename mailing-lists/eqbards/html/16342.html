<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806614234">i can&#39;t keep up more than 2 songs during a dragon, so i have been singing<br/>
elemental/niv&#39;s with selo&#39;s drum.  elemental with selo&#39;s is more FR/CR than<br/>
either psalm.  everyone already has augmentation+haste item+shaman buffs so<br/>
i don&#39;t need to play VoV.  so i give a little regen, a little str, a little<br/>
magic dmg shield (i know, all little but still) and a lot of FR/CR,<br/>
everyone&#39;s MR is high enough to resist fear without guardian.  if i am<br/>
lagging bad enough to sing one sing, it&#39;s definitely elemental.<br/>
<br/>
when i first started dragons, i also thought i should play a psalm and twist<br/>
with whatever else, and go in melee.  i wonder if that is viable now, i<br/>
wonder if i will just end up dead instead, or if the extra few FR/CR i give<br/>
with elemental with selo&#39;s drum is worth it over a psalm singing.  that is<br/>
the only reasoning i can remember for not playing a psalm, that and not to<br/>
be taunting by meleeing.  if we have a mage he/she fire shields tanks anyway<br/>
for dmg shield, but our psalms have that to (which stack, if not both).  oh<br/>
well food for thought.<br/>

&gt; You need to ask your group members what their resists are and<br/>
&gt; decide accordingly.  If they&#39;re all high level and have decent<br/>
&gt; magic resist, you can probably get away with a Psalm and<br/>
&gt; guardian.  Personally, if this was ever the case, I&#39;d probably<br/>
&gt; use Psalm + Hymn + Niv&#39;s. </span></blockquote></div>
