&gt;or have a friend that is one to progress.  Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know who told you that Rokenn but they sold you a bill of goods.  I<br/>
succeed on 66% of Cured silk tunics at skill of 44.  I made my first one at<br/>
35.  If you try Cured silk you should succeed a lot at 51 I think.  Either<br/>
that or I am just the luckiest silk tailor in all of Norrath as I am<br/>
currently 35 out of 53 for all my Cured Silk attempts rom skill 35 to 44.  I<br/>
think its more likely it is now :<br/>

Patchwork<br/>
Studded/Raw Silk	(equal difficulty?  They said they lowered Studded)<br/>
Cured Silk<br/>
Reinforced Leather<br/>
