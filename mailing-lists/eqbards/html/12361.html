<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026624712">Ok, so now I am officially spamming this board today...<br/>
<br/>
How about the level 35 song?  It&#39;s supposed to drain mana right?  I haven&#39;t<br/>
been able to figure out how/when/where and what to do with this thing.   I<br/>
dueled my brother&#39;s druid to see how significant the mana drain was and we<br/>
really didn&#39;t see its effect...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I thot of using this song to lower mob&#39;s MR and tried to clue my casters<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In testing the song (on yourself) you can see that it drop MR for 2<br/>
pulses.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, unless you play it more or less constantly, and make it stick (ie<br/>
mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt; do not resist), I&#39;d say you are not gonna be successful.  I&#39;d think that<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, considering it also has a DoT effect that&#39;s about twice<br/>
&gt; as good as singing Bellow once every three songs, if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; going to be using it I&#39;d think the extra damage would be an<br/>
&gt; important, if not the primary, factor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to get a caster to time his cast off your screen message is not<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; way to go. They would be able to synch to a single pulse.  If they see<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; message, it can bolster their confidence - knowing you are helping them<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; &gt; better results.  But you gotta keep that song going for several pulses.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Casters&#39; spells take 3 to 5 seconds to cast and with lag and what have<br/>
you -<br/>
&gt; &gt; you need to keep pulsing your song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you keep reapplying it, there&#39;s no need for casters to time<br/>
&gt; their casts to your song.  Besides, I get a kick out of the<br/>
&gt; message.  &quot;Why is [monster]&#39;s hair standing on end?&quot;<br/>
