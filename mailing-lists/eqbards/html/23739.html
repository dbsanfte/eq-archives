<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388844147">tank heavy groups are fun, even in dreadlands at higher levels, get a tank<br/>
heavy group and start fear kiting, you&#39;ll be amazed of the results, i&#39;d<br/>
usually end up pulling another in by the time that the one they were killing<br/>
was 1/4 health. any dual wielding class here is great (even rangers cause<br/>
they snare)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Last night, I was in the best group ever.  Within the space of 5 hours, I<br/>
went from 1 bubble away from 26, to one bubble inside 28!<br/>
<br/>
The group consisted of:<br/>
Bard (me)<br/>
Monk<br/>
Warrior/Paladin<br/>
Ranger<br/>
Rogue<br/>
Mage<br/>
<br/>
We handled pulls of 3, and even 4 (once I got the hang of charming..heh).<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or is a tank/melee heavy group like the one described above<br/>
better than a caster heavy group, or even a melee/caster balanced group?<br/>
Never before had I been in a group that handled so many mobs, within that<br/>
amount of time, and only once did any group member ever drop below two<br/>
bubbles of health.  She did a FD, and at half, got up, and helped us finish<br/>
off the *group* of mobs we had at the time.  Oh, wait, the rogue got beat up<br/>
once...but didn&#39;t die...hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Was it the group, or does the charm song make that much of a difference?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m amazed...I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what was suddenly so<br/>
right about being a bard in a group...and getting that much xp.  Hehe...<br/>
<br/>
Atonal the rambler...  :)<br/>
