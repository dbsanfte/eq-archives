I heard other people say this also, but I don&#39;t agree with it, I tried using<br/>
my horn and singing beserker/denons as part of my all instrument barding for<br/>
several days and did not get a single gain.  In any case my skill is maxxed<br/>
now, so I don&#39;t care :-)  My wind is the only skill I havent maxxed yet, but<br/>
I havent played EQ for weeks now, or I would have over nighted him with<br/>
invis vy now...<br/>
