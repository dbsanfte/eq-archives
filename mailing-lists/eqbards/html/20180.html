the time.  Did at all levels.  Recently was in a group with two of them!<br/>

i nearly quit playing eq, lost him as a friend, and ya. what a horrible time<br/>
that was. i avoid them now, since following experiences with encs and i just<br/>
don&#39;t mix. imho, i think enc&#39;s have a certain personality type that just<br/>
