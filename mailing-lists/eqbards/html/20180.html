<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233940802">Must just be the Enchanters you&#39;ve run with.  I group with Enchanters all<br/>
the time.  Did at all levels.  Recently was in a group with two of them!<br/>
<br/>
Certainly - it&#39;s a lot harder to pick your set of songs - but trust me -<br/>
when you get to 32 - groups love the &quot;double-crack combo&quot;.  Best way to keep<br/>
that Cleric ready to heal...<br/>

great as a warrior. we did awesome. then we both started new chars bard/enc.<br/>
i nearly quit playing eq, lost him as a friend, and ya. what a horrible time<br/>
that was. i avoid them now, since following experiences with encs and i just<br/>
don&#39;t mix. imho, i think enc&#39;s have a certain personality type that just<br/>
don&#39;t mix with bards. hehe<br/>
