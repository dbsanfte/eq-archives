<div id="ygrps-yiv-860347447">I have found that charm kiting is best done solo -- fear kiting is best done in a group. Weapons?  It depends on who I am with ...  Last night I was in Sol B doing bats and LDCs with three friends.  Shield of Song/Hymm/Chords of Cessation and we never lost more than a bubble of health.  I am fast approaching the belief that instruments are far better than weapons, post 50 -- but there is a certain satisfaction in smacking the mobs with more than your fists...<br/>
Rathe Mountains is a great place to start charm kiting.  EW is a good next step -- also many opportunities for fear kiting, both in EW with ulthorks (do the tusk quest) and in GD with Tizmaks -- look for those gloves when they drop and keep them -- nice fire and cold resists for raids later on in your career.  After 46 tho, you&#39;ll want to chant kite more.  You do more damage than with your weapons and you get hit a lot less.  At 49 it gets even easier with Accelerating Chorus.  <br/>
www.eqdiva.com is prolly the most up to date of the bard sites right now.  Look at all of them tho...  <br/>
