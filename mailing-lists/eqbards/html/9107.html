<div id="ygrps-yiv-471100024">This song is a Rain type spell. Hence the green icon. This means you need to stand far off from<br/>
your target, and then hit them with the song to avoid getting hit yourself. The song will then<br/>
hit any mobs surrounding your target. It does up to 325 dmg to each target. It can hit up to 4<br/>
targets I believe. It may not do max dmg most of the time, but it isnt resisted too often.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am just about to recieve my level 43 song (Desperate<br/>
&gt; Dirge) and had a few questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Can this song still damage the singer?  or has this<br/>
&gt; been fixed?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Is the song a true area effect?  or do you need to<br/>
&gt; target a single critter?  or can you target yourself<br/>
&gt; to get AoE around you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) How many critters can the song affect?  what type<br/>
&gt; of damage is typical?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) Is this song resisted more, less, the same as other<br/>
&gt; songs?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Along with these questions please add anything else<br/>
&gt; you would like to say about the song.  I usually test<br/>
&gt; out the songs myself, but seeing how it has such a<br/>
&gt; LONG reload time that may prove to be difficult.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>
