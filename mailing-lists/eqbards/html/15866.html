&gt;   1) When fighting ice goblin casters and the ice giant diplomat<br/>
&gt;      I lost my mystic shielding or elemental icon immediately<br/>
&gt;      during any spell attack.  This probably applies to all spells<br/>
&gt;      from all NPCs, just stated what I fought for reference.<br/>

&gt;      It&#39;s really ridiculous, any spell that hits me cancels the<br/>
&gt;      resist shield from the song.  It&#39;s like not playing any<br/>
&gt;      protection song at all, because everything hits for full<br/>
&gt;      since the shield drops due to the attack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a bug.  It should only be happening with Niv&#39;s, as<br/>
that&#39;s the only song that&#39;s supposed to have a spell damage<br/>
shield (once the shield absorbs the damage, the shield/song<br/>
drops).  If it&#39;s happening with other resist songs, I&#39;d /bug<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt;      evident when I charmed 3 ice goblins after beating them <br/>
&gt;      down to almost no health to let a lower level player gain<br/>
&gt;      exp from them.  I got the kill all three times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was doing this to help some friends a couple days ago.  I<br/>
had no problems with it.  There are some cases (usually when a<br/>
DoT is in effect) where charm will not wipe the damage<br/>
history.  There&#39;s speculation too that it&#39;s only effective<br/>
about 90% of the time at wiping the damage list.<br/>
