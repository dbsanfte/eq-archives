<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638970557">I have to disagree with you on the AI.  The AI is much better than any game<br/>
that I have played.  Yes there are places where you can trap NPC&#39;s and kill<br/>
them (exploits).  Yes trains are a problem, but is that because of poor AI?<br/>
No thats from poor players.  To me its very realistic to go in a dungeon,<br/>
get overwhelmed and have to run for my life, with everything else coming<br/>
behind to tear me to pieces.  The first time I saw really good AI is when I<br/>
took out my bow at level 7 to hit a gnoll to bring it to me.  Instead of<br/>
charging though, it did the same thing!  And continued to until I got into<br/>
melee range (where it brought out its long sword and started meleeing).<br/>
You don&#39;t think healing in battle is smart AI?  Healing other NPC&#39;s?<br/>
Standing back and casting spells until you come in range?    I was in Paw<br/>
the other night soloing the Captain.   Everytime I got it down to half<br/>
health it would heal itself (I thought to myself when did the captain start<br/>
casting spells?)  Well finally I turned around and noticed a gnoll shaman<br/>
healing him the whole time!  (should pay attention to the text more).  It<br/>
left me alone until I came after it - it was content to just stand there and<br/>
heal the captain because I was more powerful.  The AI in EQ is pretty damn<br/>
good - the terrain features are what gives the NPCs problems  (have to agree<br/>
on the quest parser though!)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally, I think there&#39;s quite a bit of balance in the classes.  Well,<br/>
&gt; individually.  I think magic users are much more powerful than melee<br/>
&gt; types,<br/>
&gt; if there&#39;s any imblalance it is in this manner.  It&#39;s all design I<br/>
&gt; suppose,<br/>
&gt; but I always felt the battlefield should be for the warriors, while the<br/>
&gt; mages stayed back home in their towers (casting spells fropm there!) or<br/>
&gt; perhaps stood on hills overlooking the battles.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In EverQuest the mages are very hardy, and exremely powerful--in this<br/>
&gt; world<br/>
&gt; the mages are the true masters of the battlefield, and the warriors are<br/>
&gt; theoir helpers.  For my tastes, a mage should be a little old man or<br/>
&gt; woman,<br/>
&gt; complete weakling, easily slaughtered with a gigantic axe...  That is if<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; could get close to them.  Of course, how could they ever survive in<br/>
&gt; Everquest?  So mages can survive battlefields, but they still have all the<br/>
&gt; good without the bad (or not enough of it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally, if I could see anything changed in this game.... it would be<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; AI!  The parser NPCs use for the quests is technologically backward.  The<br/>
&gt; original Zork games had a more complex parser, and these games are twenty<br/>
&gt; years old!!  In fact, EQ really doesn&#39;t parse for a damn.  It is highly<br/>
&gt; simplistic for a game so recent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But that&#39;s not the worse of it.  You know, one can always tell how poor a<br/>
&gt; game&#39;s AI is by looking at how the game is designed.  In the first<br/>
&gt; Civilization, the AI was given a chance against the player by letting the<br/>
&gt; computer cheat.  In Alpha Centauri, the computer does not cheat at all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The AI in EverQuest is so poor, the NPCs cheat blatantly.  Camping is not<br/>
&gt; something people do just for items.  People camp everywhere!   Groups<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; roam around together, fighting as they go!  They camp, and send out scouts<br/>
&gt; to pull.  The AI is very dumb and can be tricked this way.  I have never<br/>
&gt; played a game where trains are a way of life, never even played a game<br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt; Train becomes part of the vocabulary, and I think it&#39;s a problem.  All<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; stems from poor MOB AI.  If anything needs tweaked, it&#39;s not the PCs but<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; NPCs!!!  It inspired me to write a poem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanna be an npc<br/>
&gt; But not some stupid orc<br/>
&gt; I wanna be an npc<br/>
&gt; And be a piece o work<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanna backstab with me fists and feet<br/>
&gt; Dirk don&#39;t need it see<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d know and cast and memorize every spell there is<br/>
&gt; Mana don&#39;t need it see<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d cast and fight and kill with ease<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d be a magic monk<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanna know just everything<br/>
&gt; But a bard would be too hard<br/>
&gt; See those aren&#39;t good at everything<br/>
&gt; Npcs are never bards!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanna chase you to the zone so far<br/>
&gt; And laugh at all you cowards<br/>
&gt; I wanna chase you if you come to close<br/>
&gt; And make you camp in corners<br/>
&gt; Hah ha ha Hah ha ha<br/>
&gt; I would not be pulled you see<br/>
&gt; Npcs are are fools you see<br/>
&gt; But I would be too smart<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanna cheat like the computer<br/>
&gt; And get stuck in a corner<br/>
&gt; I wanna cheat like the computer<br/>
&gt; In a group I&#39;d be a horror<br/>
