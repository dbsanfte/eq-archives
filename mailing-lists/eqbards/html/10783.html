<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110345514">I could send it pvt but all I need is the best stuff for a melee bard ;)<br/>
<br/>
Now for stuff within reason, lets assume less than dual Yaks for now.  What<br/>
can a bard dual wield that is better than Staff o&#39; Writhing and Dragoon<br/>
Dirk? (some of these combo&#39;s I don&#39;t know if they are even possible with<br/>
primary hand restrictions whatever)<br/>
<br/>
Staff & Silver axe?<br/>
Staff & Obscidean Shard?<br/>
Staff & Obscidean Scim?<br/>
Staff & Runed Falchion?<br/>
<br/>
What is the best?  Yes I have all my melee skills maxed.<br/>
