<div id="ygrps-yiv-28921133">Ok,<br/>
<br/>
This struck me the other night.  How about a new high level quest item.  A<br/>
magical instrument that could be used for percussion and string.  No extra<br/>
effect, just dont have to switch instruments.  A Banjo!!  It is equaly<br/>
percussive and stringed.  I don&#39;t think it would be too hokey.  And if you<br/>
came up with an instrument like a Concertina (little sailors accordian<br/>
thingy) this could do the same for flute and brass. <br/>
<br/>
I do think that an insturment that can do both String and Brass would be<br/>
unbalancing and unfair.  (it would be great for damage songs).<br/>
<br/>
Comments, thoughts, critisizims?<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be fun to have a banjo.<br/>

&gt; As to them only adding instruments. I can&#39;t really see that helping a<br/>
&gt; heck of a lot and in a way, I can&#39;t see it happening at all. The only<br/>
&gt; other instruments that would benefit from an improvement would be a<br/>
&gt; stringed or brass instrument, and, remembering JM Cappozi&#39;s telling us<br/>
&gt; they still debated inside Verant whether we were too powerful, I just<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t see them giving us an instrument that would make our damage songs<br/>
&gt; do more damage. A wind instrument, IMO, would be useless. How would it<br/>
&gt; benefit us to be more invisible, or more levitated? :)<br/>
<br/>
Sirens and Strike use wind.  I would love a special wind<br/>
instrument that lets charm last longer, or be more reliable,<br/>
or gets us past the L37 limit.  It&#39;d also be nice if it<br/>
allowed Strike to have an accompanying memory blur, so you<br/>
could use it more like the enchanters mesmerize - Strike the<br/>
green mob and it forgets about you.<br/>
<br/>
A special stringed instrument would not be bad either.<br/>
Improved healing is probably out of the question, but how<br/>
about improved Lullaby?<br/>
<br/>
Also, there seems to be a hole in the percussion instruments<br/>
(Mistmoore drum is a 20% boost, Selo&#39;s Drum is a 30% boost).<br/>
It might be nice to have a L15-20ish mob drop a drum that<br/>
gives a 10% boost, though at that level 10% is probably only<br/>
a point or two of extra resist.<br/>
