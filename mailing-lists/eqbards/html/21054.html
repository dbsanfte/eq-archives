I think Verant considers Bard&#39;s their &quot;pefect class&quot; and all of us are just<br/>
&quot;whiney artistic types&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; For group travel forget about it.  The range is so small that <br/>
&gt; even manually<br/>
&gt; following the bard is near impossible with lag (warping included)<br/>
&gt; especially with SoW.  The only thing that it seems to be good <br/>
&gt; for (IMHO) is<br/>
&gt; keeping the dungeon trash off the people who are meditating.  <br/>
&gt; And when you<br/>
&gt; are running around solo.  It would be nice if Verant <br/>
&gt; increased the range,<br/>
&gt; but I am sure we all know about Verant&#39;s priorities concerning bards.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Now that I can play Clouding, I tried using it while travelling<br/>
&gt; &gt;through Firiona Vie with my Shaman husband.  He SoW&#39;d us, I played<br/>
&gt; &gt;clouding, he auto followed and off we went.  It didn&#39;t take long for<br/>
&gt; &gt;him to lose the effect of Clouding, as it seems it&#39;s range is shorter<br/>
&gt; &gt;than the auto follow range.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Does anyone bother to use Clouding for group travel?  Isn&#39;t it a pain<br/>
&gt; &gt;(other than in small spaces like dungeons) to have to use manual<br/>
&gt; &gt;follow to keep within range?<br/>
