<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087928571">complete heal is the most powerful spell in the game.  but obviously a<br/>
cleric needs to know how to use it along with their other heals effectively.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Agreed my point (which I didn&#39;t elucidate) I find a lot of <br/>
&gt; clerics who seem<br/>
&gt; to think that C Heal is the only heal they need to keep <br/>
&gt; memmed and only heal<br/>
&gt; when everyone gets that low.  It seems to me downtime is the <br/>
&gt; lowest when<br/>
&gt; done exactly as you describe.<br/>
