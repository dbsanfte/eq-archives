&gt; I&#39;m not forgetting about Kedge but the loot is horrible and people 46+ don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care about exp. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do.  And so do many of my friends and acquaintances.  Hehe obviously experience is<br/>
needed to get from 46 to 50.  For many classes 49 is the great level for spells. <br/>
For bards we have the 48 and 50 songs to get.<br/>
<br/>
Plus some on this list argue that level is all in determining your effectiveness in<br/>
a raid.<br/>
<br/>
In addition many agree that a full level buffer is a good idea before attempting the<br/>
planes.  I would suggest that is even more the case after the recent patch.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Same thing for paw and mm is usually bad loot to. 46+ don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care about exp it&#39;s just not needed. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not needed??<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Cyclops are camped all the time on E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt; and allizweasuar is done when we need stuff. Again guards are just good for<br/>
&gt; exp why do them when you don&#39;t need exp? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, ??<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kedge Keep and paw are just  two<br/>
&gt; badly designed zones. As for guards they are boring and again we don&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; exp. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And again...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Besides the fact that they are camped 24/7 on e&#39;ci hell I wasn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; on prime time on my de necro went into oggok and guards were camped inside<br/>
&gt; and out same with grobb guards. Freeport guards are always camped to inside<br/>
&gt; and out. The only places that aren&#39;t camped usually are mm, Paw, and Kedge.<br/>
&gt; Although paw and kedge are bad zones and the loot isn&#39;t very good. Again why<br/>
&gt; would a 50 want exp? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because they truncated the 50 experience so every time you die in the planes or on<br/>
dragon runs etc. you lose experience.  Unless and until you fall out of 50 into 49<br/>
this is likely not an issue.  But with enough deaths the loss of level will<br/>
eventually happen.  This means some loss in stats and of course for bards the loss<br/>
of use of Verses of Victory.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; MM is ok but the spawns are usually camped which makes<br/>
&gt; it uselss. Hell I usually end up camping something in SOl A on my 50 necro<br/>
&gt; so the overcrowding at high levles is definitly a issue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good sir, I agree completely with your core point.  I found it to be unfortunately<br/>
obscured in this message.<br/>
