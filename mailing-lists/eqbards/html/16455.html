well as snare 99% of the time.  Chain/Fear is actually better<br/>
than Snare/Fear once you get past level 38, and it&#39;s better<br/>
for stopping green runners since it&#39;ll stop them at 50%.  The<br/>
only time you absolutely need Snare is when you&#39;re fighting<br/>
high blues or higher and absolutely cannot risk runners.<br/>

classes who have to rely on root and stuns to stop runners.  <br/>
The monks and warriors in my guild are planning a trip to<br/>
Permafrost to try to get some of those webs which have 3<br/>
charges of root.<br/>
