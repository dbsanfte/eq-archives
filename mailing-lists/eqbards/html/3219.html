<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606992490">I would think that lvl 17 a shield would give you a better benefit.  At a<br/>
higher level, when you dual wield skill is higher, using two weapons would<br/>
be more effective.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it is a Catch-22.  You are not going to be able to dual wield<br/>
effectively at high levels unless you practice at lower levels.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Shield or dual wield?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;          I&#39;ve been off for awhile so excuse me if this topic has been<br/>
&gt;     beaten to death already.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;          Which is better;  using a good shield (SBS or darkwood for<br/>
&gt;     example) or using dual wield?  I&#39;m approaching 17th and have even<br/>
&gt;     procured a Dragoon dirk in anticipation of dual wield but my friend<br/>
&gt;     feels it is more advantageous to carry my SB shield saying that the<br/>
&gt;     additions damage form the occasional (why?) second strike does not<br/>
&gt;     outweigh the defensive bonus of the shield.   I end up tanking about<br/>
&gt;     half the time so this is an important question.<br/>
&gt;          My friend was on beta so I usually trust his judgment. (And he is<br/>
&gt;     also one of those power gamer types that always calculates everything<br/>
&gt;     to the nth degree.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;          So let me know what you all think.  Shield or dirk? </span></blockquote></div>
