<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655561801">Hmm, I was in cazic last night, when my favorite<br/>
cleric started wacking me.  Why? I&#39;ve been nice to<br/>
him, ah, he&#39;s charmed.  Hmm, ranger is also wacking<br/>
me.  This isn&#39;t good.  So I start charming back.  It<br/>
seemed to work, I wasn&#39;t getting wacked any more. <br/>
This was moments before our entire sever crashed for 3<br/>
hours.  I&#39;m sure it was my fault :)<br/>

&gt; Last night in Sol B I attempted to charm a GK shamen<br/>
&gt; pet and got a new <br/>
&gt; message: This NPC can not pet charmed.  It would<br/>
&gt; seem that NPC pet&#39;s are no <br/>
&gt; longer charmable.  I would have no problem with this<br/>
&gt; if the NPC Pet died <br/>
&gt; when the owner did.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know in the past people have used the charm song<br/>
&gt; to break PC&#39;s out of NPC <br/>
&gt; charm.  My guess is this may no longer work.<br/>
