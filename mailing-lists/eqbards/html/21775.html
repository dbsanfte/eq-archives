<div id="ygrps-yiv-460082394">I think the &#39;at some point&#39; means when they are working on EQ2.  It was very<br/>
apparent that nothing that is related to bards is even remotely &#39;high<br/>
priority&#39;.  Bards are at this point pretty much &#39;one hit wonders&#39;.  If it<br/>
were not for manasong the only groups we&#39;d be getting into would be those<br/>
with our friends.  Bards have become the most &#39;group oriented&#39; kiting<br/>
enabled class imaginable.  Every reason I had for playing a bard in the<br/>
beginning has been systematically taken away, other than the role-playing<br/>
aspect.  But hey!  my druid can hold a mandolin as well as anybody!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though.  I played a bard because of the tactical flexibility.<br/>
There was actually a choice of which songs to use in which circumstances and<br/>
at what times.  When was it better to Lullaby, when to Chords?  When was it<br/>
better to Anthem, and when Psalm?  Those days have gone by as each and every<br/>
tactical option is deleted or made unusable.  I never Chain unless alone<br/>
snare is now far better and only level 1!  I never Lullaby unless it&#39;s to<br/>
help some newbie, and even then it&#39;s pretty pathetic.  I&#39;ve given up trying<br/>
to Pixie anything, better to just charm it and be &#39;protected&#39; when the spell<br/>
goes off.  Verant has successfully taken 90% of the things I loved about<br/>
bards and killed them.  All because of some &#39;balance&#39; issue that never<br/>
existed.  If bards were so powerful, how come we&#39;ve always been among the<br/>
rarest classes in a game that&#39;s all about power???<br/>

I think the only answer we can respond with is that these songs need to be<br/>
reevaluated now, not later.<br/>

That was the most pathetic excuse for a response I have ever seen.  How many<br/>
times did GZ personally assure us that the Practice Lute and Small Brass<br/>
Trumpet were in game?  At least once in my presence in full view of many<br/>
others at the infamous &quot;snake testing&quot;.  Obviously bards just aren&#39;t a &quot;high<br/>
priority&quot; for anything.  We aren&#39;t casters so who cares... obviously no one<br/>
at Verant.<br/>

<br/>
apparently many of our songs are &quot;working as intended&quot; or &quot;may need to be<br/>
re-evaluated at some point&quot;<br/>
<br/>
this may be the end for me.<br/>
