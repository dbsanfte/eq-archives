attacked by some wondering cent, and the OTHER cents in the area (the named<br/>
one, and another) came to assist MY FRIEND! Sadly, my friend died before the<br/>
nice cents killed the crazy one.<br/>
<br/>
So it seems there are from wild, renegade cents roaming through the Karanas.<br/>
A bug? A quest?<br/>
