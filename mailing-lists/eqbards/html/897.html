Players who are in the game for (gasp) FUN, always want to join with me.<br/>
Why? Because grouping is fun and I&#39;m a fun Bard.<br/>
<br/>
And of course every class has advantages, including ours. We are reasonable<br/>
tanks, with dual wield we can dish out a good amount of damage, we cut<br/>
healing downtime by about one tenth, and if ever the group needs to escape,<br/>
the run song saves the lives of half the party. <br/>
<br/>
One of my biggest selling points in the Level 8 song, which I use<br/>
constantly. Most people don&#39;t know about it or how it works. But those who<br/>
do seek me out for groups. When I was Level 14, my song allowed a group of<br/>
three to take Shaman Ren Rex in Paw. Without me, a group would have to kill<br/>
3 commanders and Rex all at once (impossible at that level), but with me<br/>
and the level 8 song we could take them one at a time. Same for a group of<br/>
raiders in North Karana. 7 raiders at once was too much, so my guild leader<br/>
called me over there and all of the sudden the group could take 2 or 3 at a<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
We are also a great solo class. I have gone solo almost all the time all<br/>
the way up to Level 18. I understand from higher level bards in my group<br/>
that this soon becomes impossible, but until about Level 18 at least you<br/>
can solo easily, or just have one partner (try a monk, bards and monks are<br/>
a great combo).<br/>
<br/>
But again, aside from the fact that we are a good class with some very<br/>
useful abilities, don&#39;t forget that there are nice people in Norrath. I<br/>
have NEVER turned down someone from my group because I didn&#39;t like their<br/>
class. I have found that if I need a partner or additional party member,<br/>
ANY class makes a useful addition to my group.<br/>

&gt;Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wondering if anyone has been experiencing the same things that I<br/>
&gt;have been as of late.  To start off I remember when I finally reached<br/>
&gt;level 6 and got hymm of restoration, I was  a hot commodity in just about<br/>
&gt;any group.  However now that I am at lvl 16 no one seem to want a bard in<br/>
&gt;their party.  Perhaps it is because of my hunting in unrest, but I would<br/>
&gt;think a bard would be a useful addition to any party there.  However, it<br/>
&gt;seems a bard&#39;s utility is my undoing.  People either want a tank, or a<br/>
&gt;healer or a burner and I can never be any of them.  Many parties seem to<br/>
&gt;forget the advantages of some of the bard songs.  With anthem, my friend a<br/>
&gt;lvl 14 Druid and I were able to mow down Tormented after tormented with<br/>
&gt;next to no downtime.  In fact my friend rarely cast a spell because the<br/>
&gt;two of us could melee the TDs without too much trouble.  I was armed with<br/>
&gt;a Combine Long Sword and he a runed Totem Staff.  Now I can imagine how<br/>
&gt;effective Warriors would be with Dual wield and dual attacks and all tanks<br/>
&gt;in general.  Does partying get worse from here on out?  I have started a<br/>
&gt;mage and had more luck partying at level 13, than I did with my bard which<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t make too much sense to me.<br/>
