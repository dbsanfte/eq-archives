even *use* the BI crown.  While I don&#39;t want to dredge up the<br/>
twinking topic, I see stuff like this happening way too often,<br/>
and it&#39;s why I feel so strongly about it.<br/>

pulls that someone else (always seems to be a caster) decided<br/>
he&#39;d rather have.  As hotly contested as the gargoyles are,<br/>
most folks seem to be polite about letting the guy who gets<br/>
the first blow take it though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The charm song is simply one of our most powerful combat<br/>
&gt; related skills. The other day late I pulled a barkeeper<br/>
&gt; and a dry bones came. Again it was a friend and I<br/>
&gt; fighting, and both monsters together were too much. I<br/>
&gt; charmed the barkeeper and ordered him to guard me. We then<br/>
&gt; saw:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;an undead barkeeper backstabs a dry bones skeleton for<br/>
&gt; 154 points of damage&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, the amount of damage you can do with weapons is almost<br/>
insignificant compared to the damage mobs can do against each<br/>
other.  I have *no* qualms anymore about not &quot;helping&quot; my<br/>
group by fighting when I&#39;m busy charming.  Our main problem<br/>
has been my pets doing so much damage they get the kill while<br/>
uncharmed, and the corpse disappears.<br/>
<br/>
Just today in Mistmoore I took out two pledge and one glyphed<br/>
familiar solo using charm.  Normally I&#39;ll end a fight with a<br/>
single pledge at about half, and usually lose a fight with a<br/>
glyphed.  With these three and charm, I ended up less than a<br/>
bubble down before only the glyphed was left, and two bubbles<br/>
down when I&#39;d finished off the glyphed.  I also took out two<br/>
green caster familiars (got them to fight each other), then<br/>
had the survivor suicide against a gargoyle which I finished<br/>
off with the loss of less than a bubble.<br/>
<br/>
I also managed 5 successive kills before I had to zone.  I<br/>
charmed two into attacking each other, and new ones kept<br/>
spawning.  People were standing around watching me *win* what<br/>
looked like two consecutive three-on-one fights before the<br/>
gradual attrition dropped me below two bubbles, a caster<br/>
spawned, and I had to zone.  I probably would&#39;ve stuck around<br/>
if I&#39;d had my lute equipped (turned out I still had my weapons<br/>
up), as I&#39;d also been healing myself the entire time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The barkeeper went on to completely destroy the dry bones<br/>
&gt; in under a minute, and we got the exp since he was a pet.<br/>
&gt; Charm is outstanding also for pulling something off a<br/>
&gt; wizard or cleric because if the charm works, they are out<br/>
&gt; of danger. I have yet to see any other song of ours that<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It also works great for pulling stuff that&#39;s frenzied on a<br/>
party member.  Usually I&#39;m grouped with one (or two, or three)<br/>
paladins and they like to hang onto their lay hands until<br/>
someone is down to a half bubble.  Now they&#39;re less likely to<br/>
rush it and waste it when a monster attacks them before they<br/>
hit the LH button and thus ends up being the recipient of the<br/>
LH.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; works so well against monsters that con red. There was<br/>

&gt; Smite.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, a problem I&#39;ve been having is I think I&#39;ve retargeted<br/>
but I haven&#39;t, and I end up charming a red mob.  If there&#39;s<br/>
something nearby to make it fight, it&#39;s not that bad.  But<br/>
when it&#39;s only mob you see...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a great way to pull casting mobs.  Casters have this<br/>
annoying habit of standing way back there and nuking you<br/>
instead of being a good little mob and walking into the melee<br/>
death trap your party has set up.  I just charm the caster,<br/>
order it to follow me, walk back to our party, and have it sit<br/>
in the middle of our group.  If the caster starts to cast a<br/>
spell at you *before* you charm it, but it&#39;s charmed *when*<br/>
the spell fires, you will be protected from its effects on the<br/>
non-PvP servers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One thing I have noticed, is that ordering the pet to<br/>
&gt; attack a specific target does not always work properly.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it will attack a member of our party that hurt<br/>
&gt; it, even though it is still charmed. For this reason I use<br/>
&gt; Guard me and Guard Here. Guard Here is great if you will<br/>
&gt; have to zone, Guard me is what I use in combat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will try that.  The only annoying thing I have to say is<br/>
that the pet seems to default to guard here when you charm it.<br/>
If it sees any hostiles nearby, it will attack.  I lulled four<br/>
tidal lords and tried using charm to pull one.  It immediately<br/>
turned around and attacked another.  I told it to follow me,<br/>
which it did for about 0.1 seconds, then turned around and<br/>
attacked another.  Eventually my friend and I had to deal with<br/>
all four tidal lords at once (which wasn&#39;t too bad considering<br/>
he was on one, two were fighting each other, and I was keeping<br/>
the fourth mesmerized with Pixie Strike while playing Hymn<br/>
with my lute equipped).  My pet tidal lord finished off the<br/>
other tidal lord before my friend (L28 paladin) had gotten his<br/>
tidal lord down to about 70%.<br/>
