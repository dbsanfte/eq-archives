<div id="ygrps-yiv-724695581">Heh. I pretty much agree with your cynicism.  Hence the subject line<br/>
&quot;Probably pointless&quot;. :)  However, perhaps if enough other players take note<br/>
and inform themselves about the issues with bards, this thread won&#39;t die<br/>
until it gets properly addressed by someone at Verant.<br/>
<br/>
The original Bard Thread has been locked at 385 mostly well-written posts.<br/>
There seems to be a new one at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012233.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012233.html</a>  Please<br/>
post an explanation of what you think hasn&#39;t been addressed over the past<br/>
year.  I suspect that most other players of this great game don&#39;t understand<br/>
how much bard players have been ignored and how our class keeps getting<br/>
broken with new patches yet not fixed or tested or even acknowledged until<br/>
months later when Verant declares things to be &#39;working as intended&#39;.  Even<br/>
if Verant employees don&#39;t read the thread and understand the issues, perhaps<br/>
your post will help another player to understand.  The more people who<br/>
understand what is happening (even if they don&#39;t work at Verant) hopefully<br/>
Verant will start to realize that it isn&#39;t just a typical class whine about<br/>
bards but there is a much larger issue that affects all their players.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your ideas and support.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

&gt; Pardon my cynicism (but it&#39;s hard not) - but despite all the good points<br/>
&gt; raised - Abashi made one or two namby-pamby response.  I get the feeling<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; wanted all our comments in one place to make it easier to ignore (please<br/>
&gt; forward all comments to /dev/null...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems to me the real issue here is that Verant really doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand<br/>
&gt; our class because they think the fact that we don&#39;t use mana makes us<br/>
&gt; incredibly powerful.  Someone made a fantastic analysis (sorry forget who)<br/>
&gt; with a post describing &quot;Opportunity Cost&quot; - and of course - Abashi ignored<br/>
&gt; that post as well...<br/>

&gt; Great post!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a bard thread that Abashi has started (and if you haven&#39;t heard<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; it yet, shame on you for not keeping up on your EQ studies ;p) on the<br/>
&gt; Gameplay forum.   Currently, it&#39;s into it&#39;s 10th page, over 350 posts (and<br/>
&gt; growing), and has yet to leave the 1st page of the forum..  Please support<br/>
&gt; the bardic community by posting there (not looking for bumps or flames,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; more discussion).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, check out the latest Daily Screenshot at EQVault featuring Yours<br/>
Truly<br/>
