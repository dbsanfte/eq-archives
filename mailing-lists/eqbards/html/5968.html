<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625535008">Am level 16, and just got my screaming mace. I plan to dual wield it with my <br/>
dirk at 17 until/unless I get a tomohawk (I have about 100pp in the bank and <br/>
am still saving up).<br/>
<br/>
My 1H blunt is currently 76 (the cap at level 16 is 85); I used a fine steel <br/>
warhammer for some levels to keep my blunt skill up, so I should be able to <br/>
cap out pretty easily. My dex is currently 118, and the mace doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
proc much (but I didn&#39;t get it for the proc effect, anyway). Quick review:<br/>
<br/>
Screaming Mace:<br/>
1H Blunt<br/>
Damage: 8<br/>
Delay: 35<br/>
Weight: 8 (heavy!)<br/>
Effect: Screaming Mace (Yaulp)<br/>
Damage/Delay = 0.22857<br/>
<br/>
Was previously using Dragoon Dirk:<br/>
Piercing<br/>
Damage: 6<br/>
Delay: 23<br/>
Weight: 2.5<br/>
Damage/Delay = 0.2609<br/>
<br/>
(The dirk has obviously been relegated to the ranged weapon slot, so I can <br/>
still get the +2 dex, +3 sv magic bonus.)<br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, it&#39;ll be useful in fighting those pesky fire-shielded mobs <br/>
in Lavastorm; I used to come out severely hurt from those fights because my <br/>
dragoon dirk was so darn fast.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll definitely hang on to the screaming mace for a while, to cap out my 1H <br/>
blunt skill, if nothing else. I was considering dual wielding a tomohawk and <br/>
the mace at 17, since I tend to do most of my hunting solo (Berserker <br/>
Strength + Yaulp). Jaxan&#39;s Jig is currently one of my regularly memorized <br/>
songs anyway, so there haven&#39;t been any big changes to my songlist from <br/>
swinging around that big ole heavy thing.<br/>
<br/>
