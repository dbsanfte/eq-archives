&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, for those who missed the last post, I am a level 7, almost 8 bard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Right now I am using a regular Long Sword.  Not too dramatic..:)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I know I get dual wield at 17, and that sounds nice but I was <br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; what it maxes out at and if its better to get dual wield for <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 1h slashers<br/>
&gt; &gt; or to invest in a 2h slasher like a bibs?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can&#39;t increase your skills with 2-handed weapons, so stick to<br/>
&gt; practicing<br/>
&gt; 1-h blunt, 1-h slash & pierce.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your using a long sword at level 7?  You&#39;re doing better in life than I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; at your age.  I&#39;m using a bronze mace right now until my 1h blunt gets<br/>
&gt; maxed.  Then I&#39;ll break out a short sword.  I&#39;ve already maxed piercing<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; my level with a FS rapier someone was kind enough to include in a trade<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; a HQ bear skin I&#39;d looted.  Look to get a combine weapon as soon as you<br/>
&gt; can.<br/>
&gt; No idea how much they cost as I can never find a vendor selling one.<br/>
&gt; (grrr)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; happy hunting<br/>

are 4.  One in Oasis, one in North Karana, one in Lavastorm, and one in<br/>
Rathe Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;m not sure which camp sells which weapons (it used to be that<br/>
Lavastorm sold the only piercing ones, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true anymore)<br/>
<br/>
	The one in Oasis and North Karana are the easiest to find.  Combine<br/>
weapons sell for about 50-70pp depending on what your looking at (the 2h<br/>
ones are more expensive, but you won&#39;t be buying those)<br/>
