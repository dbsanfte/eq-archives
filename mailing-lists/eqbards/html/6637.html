<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059701571">I found it very easy to kill the fish and not get killed by a guard.  Still<br/>
took the faction hit though.  You need to have the invis song though for<br/>
this to work.  Also, I recommend against doing this quest now.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think any class but an enchanter can complete it with the recent patch<br/>
because the some of the quest items are now NO DROP.  If you still want to<br/>
know how to do it, see below for spoiler:<br/>

Stand along the side where the three NPCs are.  Look for the fish and<br/>
observe its path.  It follows the same path every time.  About halfway down<br/>
the pool, it turns around and starts over.  Get into the pool at that<br/>
location.  Make sure you are behind the column so the guard in the pool<br/>
can&#39;t see you.  Equip your lute and sing underwater breathing song.  When<br/>
fish nears turnaround point, melee attack.  Don&#39;t use bellow or chords.  The<br/>
guard in the pool did not attack me when I did it this way.  When you kill<br/>
the fish, start singing Invis song.  When I got out of the pool, a guard<br/>
walked right by me and did not attack.  <br/>

&gt; I had heard a rumor that you can fish for an extended period of time & get<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; Koalindl fish.  Just wanted to let everyone know I tested this.  After<br/>
&gt; catching<br/>
&gt; about 80 fish & assorted daggers & old shoe, I DID NOT catch a Koalindl<br/>
&gt; fish.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also I was not killed by the Paladin (thought he was not fond of me), but<br/>
&gt; by a<br/>
&gt; militia Corporal, after I did kill the fish.<br/>
