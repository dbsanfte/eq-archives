<b>Subject:</b> Gnomestock suggestion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-970112331">reguarding gnomestock... a suggestion i would have is to have all<br/>
the gnomes jump off the wizard spires in faydark, they can all be binded<br/>
right in fay just next to it, meaning they dont have to cross 2-3 zones or<br/>
have druids pick em up to gate to lavastorm, which is a serious waste of<br/>
mana/time</div>
