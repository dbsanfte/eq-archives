<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243460538">Anything that does direct damage or moves the target has a chance of <br/>
breaking root.  Bellow is doubly bad therefore... as is melee.  As has been <br/>
mentioned, some DoTs also have DD components, and these risk breaking the <br/>
root.  Basic DoTs like ours do not break root... but do remember root has a <br/>
chance of failing every tick, based on the magic resist of the target.  <br/>
Sometimes it will just break early.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been working with rooters and using DoTs for 30 levels now.  Back when <br/>
I was around 20th level I&#39;d have my enchanter friend root one or two <br/>
monsters and I&#39;d do DDD/CoD, arranging myself so I&#39;d reach all the targets <br/>
with my songs while remaining out of melee range.  These days I use the <br/>
Chants, and I&#39;ve never observed any correlation between my DoTs and <br/>
decreased duration of roots.<br/>
