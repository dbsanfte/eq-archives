<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624169753">I&#39;ve had a lot of trouble using Lugubrious Lament<br/>
effectively.  Maybe part of the problem is that I also<br/>
play a druid and Harmony seems far superior to me, not<br/>
only because it&#39;s AOE, but because it is resisted so<br/>
seldom.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard from some bards that this is a great song,<br/>
from others that it&#39;s useless.  <br/>
<br/>
My charisma is currently 91 and I&#39;m 14th lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Also, would someone have a better chance of using<br/>
Lament holding a crude stein instead of a lute?  I<br/>
have a line on one of these but since I can&#39;t hold one<br/>
and use an instrument at the same time, don&#39;t want to<br/>
spend the money if it won&#39;t work. <br/>
