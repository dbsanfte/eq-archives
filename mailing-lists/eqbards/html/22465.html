<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561833358">Hey - this is some pretty good info.  Does anyone know if there&#39;s already a <br/>
website with this stuff on it, or would someone be willing to put one up?<br/>

&gt; &gt;I need to hit shift+top row 2 to change to hotkey bank 2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Find the section in your eqclient.ini file that has these lines in it:<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE1=SHIFT+1<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE2=SHIFT+2<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE3=SHIFT+3<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE4=SHIFT+4<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE5=SHIFT+5<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE6=SHIFT+6<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE7=SHIFT+7<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE8=SHIFT+8<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE9=SHIFT+9<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE10=SHIFT+0<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Either change them to something like:<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE1=SHIFT+NUMPAD7<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE2=SHIFT+NUMPAD8<br/>
&gt;.<br/>
&gt;.<br/>
&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or change them to something like this:<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE1=SHIFT+1<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE1_2=SHIFT+NUMPAD7<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE2=SHIFT+2<br/>
&gt;KEYMAP_HOTPAGE2_2=SHIFT+NUMPAD8<br/>
&gt;.<br/>
&gt;.<br/>
&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The first will mean that you can only change pages using the shift-number <br/>
&gt;pad#...the second will mean that you can change pages with the shift-#, or <br/>
&gt;with shift-numpad#.  I noticed that in-game, you cannot add bindings like <br/>
&gt;shift-numpad#, or alt-numpad#, but it supports it, you just have to change <br/>
&gt;it in the ini file.  Also, in game (at the keyboard mappings page), you <br/>
&gt;left click on the first binding spot, and to access the second binding <br/>
&gt;spot, right click on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;An important thing to note....be sure you unbind any keys that are using <br/>
&gt;SHIFT-NUMPAD#....else the game will execute both commands at the same <br/>
&gt;time.   (Oh yeah...I&#39;m using &quot;bind&quot; to refer to keyboard <br/>
&gt;assignments...it&#39;s an old Quake habit of mine :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also noticed some stuff that they didn&#39;t put in the patch message.<br/>
&gt;1) They moved CTRL-# casting to ALT-# casting (too near the Winblows <br/>
&gt;key)  (but this can be rebound to ctrl-#)<br/>
&gt;2) ALT-casting now works for Bards<br/>
&gt;3) A lot of the / commands (like /sit /camp) now work while we&#39;re singing <br/>
&gt;songs.<br/>
&gt;4) You can use one hot key bank for your full inventory and two slots from <br/>
&gt;your equipment list (like melee 1 and 2)...since you can open backpacks in <br/>
&gt;full screen mode, there&#39;s no reason to go to the inventory screen now.<br/>
&gt;5) there&#39;s a bunch more keyboard shortcuts like CTRL-B for spellbook, <br/>
&gt;CTRL-D for disband, CTRL-I for invite/follow, CTRL-S for sitting/standing, <br/>
&gt;etc...check your keyboard mappings in game, or read the ini file : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Couple more things that I like about the patch...the turning off attacking <br/>
&gt;on autoassisting (our cleric tends to un-mez every mob sometimes when <br/>
&gt;she&#39;s trying to heal :)   Since I&#39;m so used to using 6 keys for spells, <br/>
&gt;etc, I can use the next four keys for my weapons and inventory (I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;compulsive about always knowing what I have in my hands...this way I can <br/>
&gt;see it on all my hotkey banks : )     108 new socials means we can do a <br/>
&gt;lot of fun stuff  (for you jokesters...get someone to make you a suit of <br/>
&gt;brown plate armor...then run around poking ppl and saying &quot;Can&#39;t catch me <br/>
&gt;&#39;cause I&#39;m the Gingerbread Man!&quot;  (hehe...or Woman : )).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, I&#39;ve talked enough....happy hunting!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;--Khelan, happy on Tarew Marr.<br/>
