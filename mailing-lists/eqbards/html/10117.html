<div id="ygrps-yiv-667392361">Most of the cons at 22 were white to red if remember correctly, so I imagine<br/>
that a group of that caliber could indeed hold the entrance, however, there<br/>
is a much safer spot that I would suggest.  You&#39;ll have to fight 3 or 4 to<br/>
get to it, but once there you can pull to your hearts delight without many<br/>
problems.  Be very careful getting there though, if you fall off the stairs,<br/>
you&#39;re in for a lava bath.  Here are the directions, as best as I can give<br/>
them:<br/>
<br/>
When you enter Sol A head down the short hall to the stairs.  There should<br/>
be one or two cinder or young goblins on the stairs - take these out before<br/>
continuing down.  Head down the stairs until you see a hole in the wall, in<br/>
the middle of the set of stairs.  You can duck/jump through this and avoid<br/>
the blade trap at the bottom of the stairs (although its not hard to avoid<br/>
at all).  There is usually a young or cinder gob caster in this room, take<br/>
him out.  Head forward and to the right out to the ledge which overlooks a<br/>
door.  There may be as many as three various gobs on this ledge, before you<br/>
attack them, head to the safe room.  It is down the corridor to the right<br/>
maybe 30 yards away.  Now, what makes it a safe room is that there is no<br/>
spawn inside and if you continue down the ramp in back it leads directly to<br/>
a Sol B zone.  It is a medium distance run, so if something is on you I<br/>
would suggest taking off with 2 bubbles or more, but once you&#39;ve zoned,<br/>
you&#39;re relatively safe (as long as some high levels don&#39;t train a few<br/>
Kobolds to that exit - if they do zone back and try to deal with the gobs,<br/>
the Kobolds will eat your lunch!)<br/>
Stay in this area until you hit a few more levels, and maybe try to recruit<br/>
a 25 or so tank to help with pulling.  You should be safe enough.  However I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t attempt more than 2 or 3 at a time at your level, as lullaby will<br/>
probably be resisted a lot.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a ways, but from the entrance to the safe spot when clear only<br/>
takes about 10 seconds to get to.  In that spot however, be wary of the few<br/>
trains some people bring, if its clockworks, don&#39;t even touch em.  That&#39;s<br/>
where my one death came from, two of them (not sure which ones) toasted<br/>
three of my party when I was 22.<br/>
<br/>
The gobs drop fairly nice loot for the most part, I suggest doing master<br/>
looting (the autosplit function sucks) and FS alpha.  At the end of the<br/>
night the master looter can use the split function to give everyone their<br/>
reward.  We made around 75pp per member in 5 hours in this spot one night<br/>
(it helps if you talk your group into letting you, or whoever has the<br/>
highest charisma sell the FS and split that too, there is a gnome merchant<br/>
in the dungeon but at your levels I would highly recommend you head out and<br/>
to the gypsy camp).  The good money comes when you get strong enough to<br/>
start taking on places like the Foreman&#39;s room.  Thanks to Verants wacky<br/>
random number generator, we have managed to get 6 Obsidian Scimitars and 5<br/>
Foreman&#39;s Tunics this week, I got to keep 2 of the Scims, but they sell on<br/>
our server for anywhere from 400-600pp and the tunics (which only the ranger<br/>
wanted) sell for 150-250pp (if anyone knows what a good value for these is,<br/>
please respond).  Also, I&#39;ve heard that the obsidian shard goes for as much<br/>
as 500pp?!?  I know that the proc is resisted a lot right now for me (I<br/>
switch back and forth between it and a scimitar to keep up my piercing).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s what I know, good luck, I think you&#39;ll enjoy the place!  If<br/>
anyone else has any tips, please share them!<br/>
Have fun Kitasi!<br/>
