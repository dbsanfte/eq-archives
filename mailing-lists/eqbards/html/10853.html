<div id="ygrps-yiv-901446479"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>
&gt; and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen a lot slower. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  52 days played, level 45, here.  But I excel 12 different languages,<br/>
  all my skills are maxxed, baking, fishing, pottery, smithing, fletching<br/>
  all master.  swimming to full, working on begging/instill doubt.<br/>
<br/>
  I spend a lot of time helping people who are less fortunate than me.<br/>
  Too much time... I had to have my L50 friend pull me away from helping<br/>
  people to help myself yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly* discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor that I have and I *still*<br/>
&gt; lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on the sands of Oasis,<br/>
&gt; being *less* complete than a guy that started his bard last weekend.  Not<br/>
&gt; only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having 38 &#39;played&#39; days and not<br/>
&gt; being level 50.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  But you, probably like me, and half the other people here have a <br/>
  significant other, a job, a life (allbeit it small ;p).  I have<br/>
  to shop for groceries, have to feed the kitten, have to tend to<br/>
  house chores.  When mommy does all that sh*t for you, and you<br/>
  sit there and stuff your face with rice crispy treats while she<br/>
  does your laundry... wtf wouldn&#39;t you be level 50?  I agree.<br/>
<br/>
  I sit and stare at my everquest monitor at work, thinking how<br/>
  in the hell are 15,000 people playing this game at 11am in the<br/>
  morning, souldnt they be asleep, at school, or at work???  We<br/>
  don&#39;t have that many people who play from Europe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>
&gt; &quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>
&gt; different story. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I wish our lambent armor was NO DROP, definitely.  This isn&#39;t the<br/>
  first time, I&#39;ve said it.  Won&#39;t be the last.  I try to /feedback<br/>
  my ideas, but nothing has ever come from it.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; probably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based upon<br/>
&gt; my efforts.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, visually he looks the same, and he may have a L50 sugardaddy<br/>
  but his bard ain&#39;t gonna be doing the things you are doing.  He&#39;ll<br/>
  be a blue body on the side of the road one day, just wait.  Bards,<br/>
  like we all know, aren&#39;t solo experts.  Hell we suck at melee around<br/>
  L14; that&#39;s when you are begging to get into groups.  That person will <br/>
  treat his bard like a warrior with all that equipment and will get<br/>
  creamed.  I don&#39;t want to see any more bards spring up from twinks,<br/>
  because they give us all a bad name.  I&#39;ve seen them.  They don&#39;t<br/>
  twist songs.  Sometimes they don&#39;t even play songs.  It&#39;s sad.<br/>
  They will fade out.  Those powergamers who think they&#39;re gonna<br/>
  take a bard all the way are gonna get discouraged around L20,<br/>
  when they see how weak they really are, trust me =)  That&#39;s why<br/>
  there are tons of druids, and wizards, and mages... they are <br/>
  &#39;deemed&#39; powerful soloers by the community.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes me<br/>
&gt; feel this way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Shrug it off, keep having fun.  You&#39;ll always be the better bard,<br/>
  regardless.  Level is really meaningless as far as judge of character<br/>
  and/or skill.  (Granted, you need levels to gain songs to use for<br/>
  tactics, but around L36 you&#39;ve got all the songs you&#39;ll need to be<br/>
  resourceful)<br/>
