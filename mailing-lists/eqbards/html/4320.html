<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418804312">I ran into Mr Terror while heading to Cazic Thule for my corpse.  I figured<br/>
he was like other spiders and wouldn&#39;t attack, even though it said &#39;ready to<br/>
attack&#39;.  I went up to take a snap shot (real close, since it was with my<br/>
barbarian that I encountered him and I just barely reached his under belly).<br/>
Bit me twice for 90 damage each -  I didn&#39;t get the screen shot either - I<br/>
just turned and ran for the zone.  Luckily I didn&#39;t get poisoned.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hail and well met again fellow bards!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I had the most horrendous day today and I have finished it with one piece<br/>
&gt; of advice for those on the list more newbie than myself.  DON&#39;T GO TO<br/>
&gt; INNOTHULE SWAMP WITHOUT A DAMN GOOD MAP OR GUIDE!!!!!!  A friend of mine<br/>
&gt; thought it would be fun if we could attempt a foray into Guk.  I&#39;m game of<br/>
&gt; course, so we head off.  After arriving, and dying once (they run and get<br/>
&gt; their older brothers there when they get hurt) and coming back, we<br/>
&gt; received the word of God saying it was going to be lights out for a bit on<br/>
&gt; Erollisi Marr.  I camped and came back when the server was back.  So now I<br/>
&gt; wanted to go home to familiar climes.  I though I knew the way, but when a<br/>
&gt; troll slayer started laying into me for 40 pts of damage per hit I<br/>
&gt; panicked and took off running.  It just so happened that I ran straight to<br/>
&gt; the zone entrance to Grobb!  So I died again.  Then I went to attempt a<br/>
&gt; corpse loot.  Guess what?  You got it--died.  So I tried one more time<br/>
&gt; AND....drum roll please.......DIED!!!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I finally made a troll character, consented him to loot me (3 times) and<br/>
&gt; ran to South Ro where the orcs promptly killed that character.  So I<br/>
&gt; consented the other me (the bard me) to loot the troll me.  Needless to<br/>
&gt; say, after around 3 hours and 2 experience bubbles lost later, I&#39;m back.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Guess where we headed then.....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; The moral of the story is KNOW YOU&#39;RE SURROUNDINGS!!!  Or just have fun<br/>
&gt; and die a lot.  <br/>
&gt; Just trying to lighten up the list after the last 2 threads have hopefully<br/>
&gt; flamed out!!<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; P.S. Has anyone else encountered Terrorantula?  He ate our lunch today<br/>
&gt; too.  I had never even heard of him or her whatever it is.  It has to be<br/>
&gt; the biggest creature I have seen to date.  Anyone else have a fun<br/>
&gt; encounter with this behemoth?  Feel free to share.<br/>
