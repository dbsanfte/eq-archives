<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364687711">I don&#39;t own any haste items so this doesn&#39;t affect me - but what bothers me<br/>
about this (and many of their nerfs in general) - is their inconsistency.<br/>
Take the Mask of the Deceiver (or what they called the original version of<br/>
it).<br/>
<br/>
It was their &quot;intention&quot; that it only work for bards and rogues.  They have<br/>
a bug that lets you activate the effect while holding it - not wearing it -<br/>
for any class.  By the time they figure that out (and shoot they didn&#39;t even<br/>
need to test it - if they paid closer attention to their player base they<br/>
should have realized long before) they state something to the affect that<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t take away something that so many players got accustomed to<br/>
using - they simply made it stop dropping.<br/>
<br/>
So here we have an item that&#39;s been dropping since the game started.  Been<br/>
working a certain way since the game started - and they don&#39;t like it - so<br/>
they nerf it.  But other things they don&#39;t like - they can&#39;t change because<br/>
players are used to it working a certain way even though it&#39;s broken.<br/>
<br/>
If they were so concerned about their so-called economy (the reason they<br/>
don&#39;t add NPC&#39;s who can bind for example) - they should make the new ones<br/>
that drop operate the way the patch does - and let the old ones work the way<br/>
they do now.  It would make all the old ones extra valuable and something to<br/>
trade for... (And be consistent with other past policies)<br/>

*snip haste stacking bug being fixed*<br/>
<br/>
Not a poke at you specifically, Olgwinn, just an observation.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading the Concert Hall board last night.  Why are people so<br/>
upset about this being fixed?  It has historically been referred to as<br/>
the &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find it.  Well,<br/>
its been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work that way and<br/>
everyone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask them to fix<br/>
bugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* bug!&quot;  A bug<br/>
is a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of<br/>
our overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.  Could happen.<br/>
