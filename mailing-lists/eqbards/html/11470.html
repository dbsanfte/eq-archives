<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001135666">Curious.  I remember when first playing a dark elf after playing a wood elf<br/>
for a long time that the only difference I saw was that pixies now glowed<br/>
kinds blue at night as opposed to the pink I saw before.<br/>

	As the traditional definition of the two terms yes. In game it seems<br/>
that<br/>
infravision only tends to increase contrast. I remember when I was young in<br/>
East Commonlands that at night the skeletons were easy to see since they<br/>
were light in color but the bears were almost impossible to spot.<br/>

Infra vision outlines Warm bodies and objects  in a light red haze.<br/>
Ultravision lets you see better in the dark makes everythign bright, with a<br/>
blue tinge. much better than infra<br/>

    I should know this - and could probably look it up if I&#39;m not lazy..<br/>
But what&#39;s the difference between Ultravision and Infravision..<br/>
