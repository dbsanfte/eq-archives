<b>Subject:</b> Psalm of Purity and Vitality Broken again? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-142903636">Last night I was up in hate, with my regular song mix which includes Psalm<br/>
of Purity and Psalm of Vitality.  I normally play these songs during<br/>
downtime to relieve the cleric of curing duties.  Up until last night, I<br/>
would get a message...&quot;You have been cured of your affliction&quot; or something<br/>
like that each time my song successfully pulsed against poison or disease,<br/>
and after a few successful pulses the poison or disease would drop on group<br/>
member Soandso.<br/>
<br/>
Well last night I never saw that message, and no group member ever was cured<br/>
by my song.  I am just wondering if you guys have noticed the same thing?<br/>
If any of you are in a position to quantitively test this over the weekend,<br/>
please do so so we can get a bug report submitted ASAP if it is in fact<br/>
broken.  The possibility is also that my group was unresponsive to me, and<br/>
it is simply the success message which is broken.<br/>
