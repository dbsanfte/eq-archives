undead to gain experience off.  Most con&#39;d either red, yellow, or blue to<br/>
my 30 (mostly yellow of what I saw) from passing through earlier, but when<br/>
we ventured there none showed on track (34 ranger).  We set up shop down<br/>
by the commons zone and the ranger ran circles searching for stuff, to no<br/>
avail.<br/>
<br/>
Then nightfall came.<br/>
<br/>
Not far from where I was, a skeleton trooper appeared.  I said, &#39;skel<br/>
trooper spawn,&#39; as someone shot an arrow at it.  &#39;It&#39; turned out to be<br/>
four, two of which headed straight for me, to be followed by the other two<br/>
after Selo&#39;s pulsed.  I was hit for maybe 100, along with a bunch of<br/>
misses, when I suddenly dropped dead.  No backstabs, no criticals, no harm<br/>
touch, just plain dead.  I got a res, then while waiting for my group to<br/>
finish a fight I was jumped by an ghoul cleric or something and lost<br/>
connection to server, and we all know how if you lose your connection in a<br/>
fight it&#39;s interpreted by the server as you dying (bitter?  nah).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m off to Kithicor from Halas now.  My advice to you would be check what<br/>
time it is before logging Kitasi in. -.-<br/>
