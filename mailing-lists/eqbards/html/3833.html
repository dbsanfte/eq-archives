<div id="ygrps-yiv-824160802"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; (generalized you there, please dont take it personally.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What part of this line doesnt make sense?  Pardon me for going off on a<br/>
small tangent at the end of my post and suddenly realizing that it could be<br/>
taken personally, and asking that it not be.  That portion was directed at<br/>
the large number of posts I see on websites everywahere bitching back and<br/>
forth about how this element of the game or that element of the game is<br/>
totally worthless and should never have been included.  And to a certain<br/>
extent you DID go there, in that you claimed that trade skills aren&#39;t part<br/>
of teh fun of the game.  Just because they aren&#39;t part of YOUR fun, does not<br/>
mean they aren&#39;t part of the fun for someone else... including me and my<br/>
party.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;And yes i did take that personally , and putting something like that at the<br/>
&gt;end of such comments is utter bull. You had an intelligent post up until<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;end, therefore an intelligent person will know how someone will take it,<br/>
&gt;regardless of the footnote.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I personally take THIS comment as an insult.  To me, an intelligent<br/>
person would see the merit in a commentary and realize that if someone says<br/>
&quot;that&#39;s a general you above and not directed at the person that the rest of<br/>
the post is directed at&quot;, that is PROBABLY what they meant, and thusly they<br/>
shouldnt take it personally.  Geesuz  We&#39;re all human.  I&#39;m human, you&#39;re<br/>
human, and joe blow on the street who hates EQ and thinks we&#39;re all<br/>
pyshcotic freaks in need of therapy is human too.  I go off on a tanget<br/>
occassionally.  And sometimes I dont want to delete it because it&#39;s how I<br/>
feel and it&#39;s what I want to say... but it also isnt necessarily directed at<br/>
any one person... and thusly I say &quot;dont take this personally,. it&#39;s a<br/>
general rant&quot;.  If you can&#39;t identify with that... well... too damn bad.</div>
