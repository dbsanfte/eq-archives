<div id="ygrps-yiv-681011726">No, but there&#39;s more to it than you might think.  You need to know how to organize groups, buff people,<br/>
pull stuff, battle tactics, and loot rules.  It&#39;s probably impossible to do this effectively if you&#39;re<br/>
essentially doing &quot;pickup&quot; groups each time.  Buffing alone can take hours if you don&#39;t have it organized<br/>
well up front.  Heck, just getting people into groups can take a couple of hours if you don&#39;t know who you<br/>
have available and they aren&#39;t organized.<br/>
<br/>
If two or three guilds consistently work together, or if one larger (but not quite large enough) guild<br/>
fills in the holes by picking up extra players or another small guild, it can work just fine, though.<br/>
