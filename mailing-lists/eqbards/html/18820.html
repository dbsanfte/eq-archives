There&#39;s a level based &quot;Auto detect invis&quot; built in to prevent abuse of the<br/>
spell/song to get past extremely dangerous areas.<br/>
<br/>
Always has been.  The reason you notice it more in kunark is that more npc&#39;s<br/>
there are over the magic level.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Switching subjects here, but I question the value of invisibility now.<br/>
&gt; Whats the rationale on why most mobs in Kunark see thru invis?  In my<br/>
&gt; experience with the older zones, the only mobs that could see thru invis<br/>
&gt; were undead and any mob that could cast the See Invis spell.  I&#39;ve walked<br/>
&gt; completely thru Mistmoore with invis song up and everything I saw conned<br/>
&gt; Indifferent.  Almost all of the mobs that were in there were yellow or<br/>
&gt; higher to me.  I realize there were a few other mobs that could see thru<br/>
&gt; invis but they were the exception not the norm.  Now it seems that for the<br/>
&gt; most part invisibility in Kunark is almost worthless.  I&#39;ve been fighting<br/>
&gt; the giants in Frontier Mtns and everyone one of them see thru invis even<br/>
&gt; though they are lower than 35th level.  So red mobs in Mistmoore can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; me but blue mobs in Frontier Mtns can?  Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  Also,<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; the time a warrior is high enough level to get the armor that gives this<br/>
&gt; effect, almost everything he will be fighting can see thru invis because<br/>
&gt; they are a high level mob.  So I would imagine a lot of them view getting<br/>
&gt; Invisibility in their armor almost as much as we view getting Summon Water<br/>
&gt; as worthless.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; level 25 is &quot;nifty&quot; to get something like this.  level 53 to get these is<br/>
&gt; completely useless.  a warrior getting invisibility at level 53 however is<br/>
&gt; something they would absolutely DIE for.<br/>
