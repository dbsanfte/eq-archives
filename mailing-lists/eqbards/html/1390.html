<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002746362">This isn&#39;t related to the first question but it has something to do with Area <br/>
Effect songs so I figured I&#39;d continue with this header.  My part hunted <br/>
Mistmoore for the past 3 days and we hunt right at the zone.  Well...either <br/>
Mistmoore is bugged or my area song is hitting the npcs you hear casting <br/>
through the walls, because we have had trouble with those same npcs coming to <br/>
the zone and killing us all when we did nothing to provoke them. The AoE <br/>
songs I used were fear, lull, and denon&#39;s. My only conclusion is that my song <br/>
radius is reaching them, I tried to talk to a GM who just told me that higher <br/>
lvl dungeons need a bit of tweaking.  If anyone has any other information I&#39;d <br/>
love to hear from you.  <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
