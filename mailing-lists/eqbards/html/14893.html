<div id="ygrps-yiv-673654759">Just trying to get clarification.. did you find Togor&#39;s<br/>
slowed more?  I hope so, I was under the impression it was the best slowdown<br/>
in the game?  Is that what you found or no?<br/>

<br/>
				  I&#39;ve been meaning to post this for the<br/>
last week.  Got too rilled<br/>
				  up with posting rants and projects at<br/>
work.<br/>
				 <br/>
				  I was testing chains with an enchanter<br/>
friend and a shaman friend.<br/>
<br/>
				  Test subject was ice giants.  L43 ice<br/>
giants hit max 116, and have<br/>
				  on occasion quad attacked me.  Triple<br/>
attack is not unheard of, and<br/>
				  they almost always double attack.  It&#39;s<br/>
very easy to see speed <br/>
				  differences with these npcs because if<br/>
they are not slowed down<br/>
				  they usually wipe you out in a few rounds.<br/>
<br/>
				  With chains on, will Togors/Shiftless will<br/>
stick to the npc?<br/>
<br/>
				  To test this, I pulled an ice giant with<br/>
chains and kept chaining<br/>
				  it until the shaman or enchanter would<br/>
slow it down.  I then stopped<br/>
				  using chains.  The ice giant was swinging<br/>
at the speed I would expect<br/>
				  for those spells applied.<br/>
<br/>
				  With Togors/Shiftless already on the npc,<br/>
will chains break it?<br/>
<br/>
				  I pixie striked an ice giant out and let<br/>
it chase me around<br/>
				  until the shaman or enchanter would cast<br/>
on it.  Then chains<br/>
				  were applied and were left to wear off.<br/>
The ice giant did<br/>
				  not return to it&#39;s typical crushing speed.<br/>
It stayed at it&#39;s<br/>
				  slowed pace.<br/>
<br/>
				  Which is more powerful?<br/>
<br/>
				  Well all the tools I&#39;ve seen to analyze<br/>
the spells conclude that<br/>
				  chains and shiftless deeds are equivalent<br/>
in the attack speed<br/>
				  amount, and togors falls a little behind<br/>
them.  This just isn&#39;t<br/>
				  the case.  With togors/shiftless on an<br/>
npc, I can count seconds<br/>
				  before they attempt to swing.  With<br/>
chains, it&#39;s kinda like a <br/>
				  small visual decrease but nothing fancy.<br/>
Chains is nice for <br/>
				  the mobility effect, but can be outdone by<br/>
other atkspeed spells.<br/>
<br/>
				  I also camped the live side king a week<br/>
and a half ago and had similar<br/>
				  results with both a shaman and enchanter<br/>
in the group.  Chains just<br/>
				  didn&#39;t seem to impact the speed component<br/>
at all, yet it provided<br/>
				  the negative movement component just fine.<br/>
<br/>
				  I need someone to confirm these<br/>
conclusions.  I&#39;d prefer the tests<br/>
				  be done on ice giants, because it is<br/>
glaringly evident when they <br/>
				  attack if their speed is normal, chained,<br/>
or togors/shiftless.<br/>
<br/>
