<div id="ygrps-yiv-380631244">I haven&#39;t used it much in a long time - so I don&#39;t know if this is very<br/>
new - or always was there but terrain related...<br/>
<br/>
    Anyway - I tried Screeching a Green Mountain Giant in Frontier Mountains<br/>
and Screech basically completely didn&#39;t work.  No resist messages - just<br/>
didn&#39;t take place.  I was close enough to the Mountain to get hit by it -<br/>
but he was far enough away (due to Height Obviously) to be immune to it.<br/>
<br/>
    I recall using Screech many levels ago against one of the &quot;oon&quot; named<br/>
Ogres (I forget which one) in my mid 20&#39;s - and it worked nicely.<br/>
<br/>
    I think this is a problem we should have Verant look into.  I even tried<br/>
to get RIGHT next to the Giant and sing it.  Equipped the Brass and it still<br/>
didn&#39;t work...<br/>
