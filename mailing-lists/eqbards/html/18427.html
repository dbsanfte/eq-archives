<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605151746">I don&#39;t know about now. Before the expansion came out, though,<br/>
KEdge Keep was packed on Solusek RO. SEveral times, my guild went<br/>
to go there, only to report &quot;53 people in Kedge&quot; and they&#39;d<br/>
have to find something else to do.<br/>

&gt;Hail Fellow Tunesmiths,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kinda anti climatic now, but Ding! Welcome to L50.<br/>
&gt;All I can say is get a group together and start on the first floor <br/>
&gt;of Kedge <br/>
&gt;at L35 or so, and work your way through as you level up. The loot <br/>
&gt;sucks, but <br/>
&gt;the respawn rate makes this about the fastest experience place we <br/>
&gt;have ever <br/>
&gt;seen, and it&#39;s nearly always empty, even on Xegony.<br/>
