<div id="ygrps-yiv-883083550">Pardon me - but I was born in Chicago, IL in 1962.  I&#39;m an American and have<br/>
lived here all my life.  I&#39;m not &quot;stereotyping Americans&quot;.  I&#39;m stating my<br/>
OPINION of what is wrong with my country.  If you are unable to deal with<br/>
any sort of criticism - I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
I DO believe that we are arrogant and never consider markets outside our<br/>
own.  Almost every article I&#39;ve read talks about EQ being the &quot;Largest&quot;<br/>
MMORPG Game.  It&#39;s not.  There&#39;s a Korean game that&#39;s larger.  It&#39;s much<br/>
larger.   Whether their number is 2.7 million as they claim - or something<br/>
close to 800K (not sure - as Tallies show they use some voodoo accounting to<br/>
get that number) - only looking at the American market when talking about<br/>
&quot;The Largest&quot; or &quot;Best&quot; is a failing that we&#39;d be better off if we expanded<br/>
or viewpoint.  The future of the world is global and it&#39;s time to start<br/>
looking at it that way.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t post any more on this subject as it is getting OT...<br/>

<br/>
Stereotyping of Americans is no better than American arrogance, real or<br/>
perceived...<br/>
<br/>
This thread is now dead to me.<br/>

&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
  In typical American<br/>
arrogance - we talk about EQ being the biggest because we only look at our<br/>
market But their BloodPledge game has 2.7 million subscribers.  That&#39;s not a<br/>
typo or a mistake.  Those are almost all in Asia and they only recently<br/>
started marketing in the US market.<br/>
