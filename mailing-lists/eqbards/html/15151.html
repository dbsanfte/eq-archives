<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121339282">Hi all!  A bardic friend of mine mentioned to me that<br/>
there was a discussion going on about EBW vs Ykesha<br/>
with actual log files involved! :)  I only read over 4<br/>
or 5 digests here so please forgive me if I bring up<br/>
something already mentioned.  John is there any way<br/>
you&#39;d be able to make the log data itself available,<br/>
posted or emailed to me directly?  Allow me to<br/>
elaborate on why I&#39;m looking for this information...<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re going to evaluate two weapons (ykesha 8/24<br/>
with proc and EBW 7/21 no proc) i&#39;d like to get the<br/>
most accurate representation of damage over time the<br/>
weapons deal out.  There appears to be a damage bonus<br/>
for the primary hand of (level-25)/3, or 8 points at<br/>
level 50.  This 8 points is applied more often the<br/>
faster the weapon swings and hence favors the faster<br/>
weapon given the same dmg/delay ratio.  Looking at<br/>
logged data we see a modal spike at the &quot;magic number&quot;<br/>
(MN) which is 2*dmg + dmg bonus.  This leads me to use<br/>
MN/delay as the comparison at this time.  However,<br/>
this isn&#39;t really a good approximation of the damage<br/>
curve.  SO what I&#39;m getting at is I&#39;d like the log<br/>
data in its raw form to see if I can figure anything<br/>
out usefull from playing around with it.<br/>
<br/>
Ok ok ok I get bored at work! :)  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
