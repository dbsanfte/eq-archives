this.<br/>

Lullaby can be very useful if you have a rogue and healer in your group and <br/>
fighting multiple mobs.  While you sleep the rest of the mobs, the rogue can<br/>
<br/>
backstab the one you are fighting and the cleric can heal you.  But I <br/>
usually don&#39;t use lullaby unless there is a healer in the group and everyone<br/>
<br/>
in the group knows what the ASSIST command is for.<br/>
