<b>Subject:</b> Re: Percussion VS Stringed <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-708477039">Based on interesting new information I have recently gleaned from this list,<br/>
I started singing Jaxon&#39;s Jig with a drum last night in between fights<br/>
because we had a lot of people using manna in the group I was in.<br/>
Apparently the Jig with a drum *Does* increase the rate at which one<br/>
meditates by about 10%.  However, I discovered inadvertently in the process<br/>
that playing songs that use the drum seem to REALLY anger mobs a lot<br/>
more...as a matter of fact I was in a group of 6 and every orc that would<br/>
spawn at the coastal orc camp (an warrior, an priest, a warrior, etc.) would<br/>
charge at me full speed and totally concentrate on trying to kill me - I<br/>
noticed that if I did not play percussion songs the MOBs would not be as<br/>
hell bent to kill me, usually one 1 at a time would forget what they were<br/>
doing and decide the little wimpy bard with the instrument was the one he<br/>
should be killing instead of the buffed tank who is dual<br/>
wield/attack/kick/bashing him.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed this in the mino caves in steamfront...if I would turn on<br/>
accelerando and go run through the tunnels and then back to the main cave to<br/>
stand with my group, any MOB that would spawn in the next few minutes would<br/>
immediately run out of the tunnels and attack me...I didn&#39;t even have to be<br/>
in range or in sight.  I started to think that the song must leave some kind<br/>
of residual affect in an area that still provokes MOBS even a few minutes<br/>
after you have left.  It seems strange and unlikely, but I suspect others<br/>
have experienced something similar.</div>
