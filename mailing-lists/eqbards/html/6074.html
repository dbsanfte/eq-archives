<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412446301">I have a humble suggestion. Maybe we should also ask (not require, but <br/>
strongly recommend) that threads stay true to the subject line? And if the <br/>
subject of the thread strays too far from the subject line, that we try to <br/>
change the subject line to something more appropriate?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List, a mailing list<br/>
&gt;dedicated to all for and about the Bard in EverQuest<br/>
&gt;As assistant moderator, I&#39;ve decided that we should have something<br/>
&gt;resembling guidelines, and also a few hints for those who may just be<br/>
&gt;joining us.<br/>
&gt;First, some basic rules:<br/>
&gt;(Common sense stuff, really)<br/>
&gt;1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible).  While we do often stray off the<br/>
&gt;path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the material &quot;of-interest&quot; to<br/>
&gt;our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are acceptable, because Bards<br/>
&gt;have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are not.  Deliberate spam<br/>
&gt;will NOT be tolerated, and any person doing so will be immediately reviewed<br/>
&gt;for warning, removal or banning.<br/>
&gt;2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please<br/>
&gt;be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read through, and then<br/>
&gt;make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>
&gt;all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you simply MUST insult,<br/>
&gt;badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>
&gt;3) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old list-term for a thread that is<br/>
&gt;being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when a thread has<br/>
&gt;degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid for this list, or<br/>
&gt;when the subject matter has become too inflammatory to be discussed.<br/>
&gt;4) No Attached Files!  If you wish to share with us your latest picture,<br/>
&gt;some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply include a link within<br/>
&gt;your email to an appropriate place online.  If you have no access to such,<br/>
&gt;email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post it for you, and<br/>
&gt;follow up to the list with the URL.  Small infractions will probably be<br/>
&gt;overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our European readers who<br/>
&gt;have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>
&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
