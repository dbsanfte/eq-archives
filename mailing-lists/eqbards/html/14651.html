 </span></blockquote>Believe me, he was using tashan(i)(a).  If you run across an<br/>
enchanter who doesn&#39;t, boot him from your group.  :)  It has a<br/>
ridiculously short cast time, is almost never resisted, and<br/>
costs next to no mana.  In return, it debuffs MR by about<br/>
20-45 points.<br/>

&gt; the most likely reason my songs stuck better.  Another good reason why bards<br/>
&gt; and enchanters group well together.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is why the orb of tashani usually goes to a bard.  :)<br/>
