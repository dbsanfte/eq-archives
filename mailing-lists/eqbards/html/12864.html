<div id="ygrps-yiv-291971866">A bard can&#39;t twist songs sitting down as you know, and you are there for<br/>
2 things - reducing mana regen time during buffing and to buff resists<br/>
during the fight. Without getting into a tactics discussion, if you are<br/>
only playing 1 song during the actual dragon battle then you aren&#39;t<br/>
worth the spot you are filling, and a warrior would be much better<br/>
served in it. On every dragon raid or large scale fight, you want to<br/>
show your group just how valuable a bard is, like when people from other<br/>
groups die from attrition, but your resist buffs keep your party going<br/>
until the very end.<br/>
<br/>
Then you have to remember that maybe other bards just bellow and play<br/>
mana regen. Now, when it comes to the hard fight, who will get the<br/>
invite? You, because you know what you are doing and people like to win.<br/>
The best example I can think of is Dracoliche in PoF. A bard will<br/>
completely neutralize Draco&#39;s AE weapons if they know their trade.<br/>
What&#39;s really funny is seeing how many bards need to be told what to<br/>
play, because they don&#39;t know on their own. Song selection is an<br/>
extremely important part of our class. Knowing when to play what and<br/>
constantly experimenting, observing, and trying out new tactics are what<br/>
really set people apart (and this list helps alot with that creative<br/>
process). The spell interrupt with Lullaby I noticed watching a L8 Bard<br/>
at the West Commons Orc Camp. What&#39;s scary is just how effective that<br/>
trick is - Lullaby is always memm&#39;d when I may have to solo a<br/>
cleric-class monster. :)<br/>
