<br/>
I understand that EQ is not about fashion.  That would be the furthest from<br/>
my mind.  But their are certain psychological factors that come into play,<br/>
that cannot be ignored.  I play an 18th level Human Bard on Brell.  I am<br/>
decked out currently in a full set of banded.  I like the protection that it<br/>
gives me, but the helmet has got to go.  Banded Helms on a male human look<br/>
like some kind of crazy WWII style third reich comedy.  I am constantly<br/>
getting comments about how I look like a schultz from Hogans Hero&#39;s.  :(<br/>
This was really funny at first and I have laughed my ass off at myself on<br/>
more that one occasion, (especially while doing the silly DDD dance).  But<br/>
it is starting to wear on me now, and I need some advice.<br/>
<br/>
I though that perhaps I might want to get a blackend iron helm, and I have<br/>
been /auction&#39;ing for one for the last week, but I finally saw a guy last<br/>
night wearing one, and it looks the same.  If fact, it looks even more<br/>
Nazi-like because its black.<br/>
<br/>
Im at the point now that I will remove my helmet when I get to populated<br/>
areas and towns because I just dont think that a Bard would be wearing that<br/>
ugly thing while perfoming.  However I really need the AC boost from it to<br/>
be effective in combat.  The people I play with ask me if its my songs or<br/>
the helmet that the Orc of Highpass hate.  And I&#39;m not sure anymore:(<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Does anyone know if there is a helm comparable Banded that looks different<br/>
on Humans, and where might I get one?<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me if the Plate Helm looks similarly silly?<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other armor types that will protect me &gt;= Banded and make me<br/>
look different, while not being unattainable by a 18th level untwinked bard?<br/>
<br/>
I know the whole thing is silly and I don&#39;t want to be superficial.  My<br/>
character is not my helmet - my helmet is not my character :) but the whole<br/>
thing really kinda has me down.  Thanks for any comments ahead of time.<br/>
