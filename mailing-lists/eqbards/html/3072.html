mouse, either for work or leisure.  I twist two songs pretty easily by<br/>
having the ones I want to twist on hot buttons, next to each other.  I only<br/>
have to shift the mouse a little, onto the button for the next song, click<br/>
to stop current song, click to start next one.  Shift, wait a bit, click,<br/>
click.  Repeat.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried doing it with the keyboard and like the mouse better.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also remapped all my favorite keyboard commands, including the ones<br/>
for the hot buttons, onto the keypad.  I play with keyboard shifted left,<br/>
so my left hand is comfortable on the arrow keys and my right on the mouse.<br/>
 Then I cruise.<br/>
