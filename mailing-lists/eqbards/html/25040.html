<div id="ygrps-yiv-442117298">Most people I&#39;ve talked to who game on Win2K generally have no problems,<br/>
however, if all you&#39;re doing is games, it&#39;s recommended to stick with<br/>
Win98SE.  On the other hand, if you, for example, work from home, and your<br/>
machine is also productive (in a not fun sort of way...heh), then you may<br/>
benefit by the better stability and features of Win2K.<br/>
<br/>
To boil it down a little:<br/>
<br/>
If your gaming machine is used to cruise the web, and do the occassional<br/>
word document, or some such, go with Win98SE.<br/>
<br/>
If you happen to play games on your productivity/work machine, go with<br/>
Win2K, unless you&#39;re happy with Win98, of course.  :)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not sure, games run better under Win98.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  :)<br/>

I have to agree with Atonal. Stay as far away from ME as you can.  A friend<br/>
convinced me to install it on my machine and not 3 weeks later, I was<br/>
getting weird dll errors and it would not shut down properly.  My friend had<br/>
the same problems on his machine.  I have heard that a service pack is<br/>
required if you install ME and I didn&#39;t do that since I didn&#39;t know at the<br/>
time.  So I am back to W98 and running fine.  I am interested in anyone&#39;s<br/>
opinion of Win2K and gaming.<br/>
<br/>
For the record I am running:<br/>
PIII 450<br/>
256 Meg Ram<br/>
10 Gig HD<br/>
Viper770 Video card w/16M of memory (wouldn&#39;t mind upgrading this eventually<br/>
but it runs great)<br/>

I would recommend that, under no circumstance, &quot;upgrade&quot; to ME!!  I have<br/>
heard more bad than good about it.  Your best bet, for a gaming machine, is<br/>
Windows98 Second Edition.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine bought a new machine with ME on it.  It was plagued with<br/>
random, unexplained blue screens and other crashes.  He reformatted with<br/>
Win98SE over a month ago, and has not had one single blue screen or random<br/>
crash since then.<br/>
