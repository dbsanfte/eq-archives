&gt; Hearing whether it was out of Verant&#39;s responses that they decided to <br/>
&gt; switch classes would help back up your argument, as it seems to me that at <br/>
&gt; higher levels EQ is different from your standard gameplay.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve lost other 50+ players, as 50+ is mindnumbingly tedious at times,<br/>
but in their case, they&#39;ve quit, not taken over other characters and<br/>
continued playing.  Where do you think the characters the 3 bards I<br/>
mentioned play now came from? :)<br/>
<br/>
In effect, 3 of the bards I mentioned haven&#39;t said they&#39;re tired of the<br/>
game, they&#39;ve said they&#39;re tired of playing bards. I can&#39;t think of any<br/>
50+ member of my guild that&#39;s left to play another character. Oops, just<br/>
remembered one paladin that left to start a cleric on another Torv. If<br/>
he&#39;d stuck around he probably could have taken over a cleric account<br/>
from one of those that left.<br/>
