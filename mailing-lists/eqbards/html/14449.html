&gt; Ran out of lavastorm with 50 health.  Couldn&#39;t even see a pixel on my health<br/>
&gt; bar.  Entered Nek and fired up the Hymn.<br/>

&gt; Two players are killing a DE guard 30 feet from me, on the path.  Guard spins<br/>
&gt; around, runs down the path, across the zone entrance alcove,<br/>
&gt; and cuts my head off.<br/>

it actually went up.<br/>
