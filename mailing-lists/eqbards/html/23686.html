<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530583089">I think my best example of this sort of things was when a Cleric joined the<br/>
party (not the first caster in the group) and immediately told me to &quot;play<br/>
mana please&quot;.  I sort of ignored it ... and a few mintues later he says<br/>
&quot;ahhh mana coming back faster already!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was level 30 (not anon, not roleplaying)<br/>
He was very happy.<br/>

&gt; Agreed - the funniest thing about the haste issue - is most are convinced<br/>
&gt; they stacked at one time (When did they nerf this?)  I usually tell them<br/>
&gt; (probably correctly - but if not at least they save face) that they are<br/>
&gt; mixed up with the fact bard haste stacks with haste items -not other<br/>
classes<br/>
&gt; haste spells.  Some still insist its true - even to the point of - when I<br/>
&gt; sing it to show them they say &quot;See I&#39;m faster now&quot;...  (The funniest<br/>
&gt; incident - I was arguing a tank about this - and he shouts to zone &quot;Does<br/>
&gt; Bard Haste stack with Shaman?&quot; and then some Uber 60 Tank from some Uber<br/>
&gt; Guild says no - and this guy acted like it was the word of God...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway - I agree tone has a lot to do with it.  I have no problems at all<br/>
&gt; with people ASKING me to play certain songs (particularly when I first<br/>
join<br/>
&gt; the group and am setting up - not in the middle of combat).  Even in the<br/>
&gt; case when they ask for a haste song when a Shaman is singing haste<br/>
&gt; (mistakenly believing it stacks) - if they ask me nice enough - fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What annoys me the most is people who say &quot;Just sing Mana&quot;.  Anyone who<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; done the research (ie read the testing on eqsongs.com or tested<br/>
&gt; themselves) - knows that barring missed notes - the mana recovery of &quot;just<br/>
&gt; singing mana&quot; and twisting one other song is identical.  You might as well<br/>
&gt; tell tanks to toggle of attack every other tick...<br/>

&gt; Not exclusive, but bards definitly suffer from this the most.  I have no<br/>
&gt; idea why all thse people assume they know how to play my 51 bard better<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; I do.  I guess they all play lvl 60 bards as their primaries.  I still run<br/>
&gt; into to people that insist my normal haste songs (not the Ervaj ones)<br/>
stack<br/>
&gt; haste effects with enchanters.  &quot;DEWD!!! I tested it MYSELF!!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I am in a group where I am lacking any realy good songs to play, I will<br/>
&gt; offer to play mana song full time.  Usually this would involve having a<br/>
&gt; chanter/shaman and cleric (maybe 2 of the three along with another int<br/>
&gt; caster).  It gives me a break from weaving, which is nice.  However I<br/>
&gt; explain to them thsat they need to med close to the fights (thus must pull<br/>
&gt; close to the medders).  USually they ignore me, so I go back to singing<br/>
&gt; other songs (since mana song ain&#39;t hitting the caters anyway).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When someone tells me what songs to play, I ignore the first time they say<br/>
&gt; it.  Then say, &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing&quot;, the second time.  If they<br/>
continue,<br/>
&gt; it is dependent on my mood.  I will usually just go back to ignoring them,<br/>
&gt; but occasionally I will go on a rant about how I don&#39;t tell them what<br/>
&gt; weapons to wield, skills to use, spells to cast, etc...  It also depends<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; their &quot;tone&quot;  If they are trying to be helpful, I will merely explain whY<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; am playing what songs I am singing.  Occasionally someone actually makes a<br/>
&gt; good suggestion, and I will swtich my melody...<br/>
