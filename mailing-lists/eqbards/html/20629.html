<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817852041">Well I finally got my bard out of the closet and ready to start playing<br/>
again (he was naked almost)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, i log in another character yesterday and get tells from multiple<br/>
friends that have me on their /friend list and they&#39;re going on about my<br/>
bard being a lev 1 gnome enchanter.  Ok this is getting my attention.  I<br/>
petition right away the gm&#39;s and send a tell to a guide (which ignored me<br/>
outright)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, i got multiple petitions in over the night and no gm responded. I<br/>
even talked to the gnome that had my name, was really weird feeling.  It&#39;s<br/>
pretty scary to know there&#39;s a newb out there with the name of your decked<br/>
out character (decked out to me anyways).  About a couple months ago, my<br/>
bard was renamed to MinkinX from Minkin just out of the blue, and now all of<br/>
a sudden he was back to Minkin. I have a feeling they fixed the problem with<br/>
him and now he&#39;s back to normal, but they forgot to remove the name from the<br/>
name filter list or something.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s what i plan to do, i want to get him renamed completely incase<br/>
something like this happens again as im getting paranoid. Anyone have a<br/>
suggestion for a new name? He&#39;s a wood elf if that gives you any more<br/>
ideas... What really pisses me off is that i made that bard in april 99,<br/>
he&#39;s been around for a long time, and seeing the name go will be a pain, but<br/>
i&#39;d rather rename him then have him duped or lose him or something.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time<br/>
