<b>Subject:</b> Re: Dwarven Work Boots <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-469475364">I went to unrest last night and I was determined to get my dwarven Work<br/>
boots.<br/>
Well, it was a long night and was quite stressful but basically we waited<br/>
until<br/>
about 9:30-10 pm before we could take the Ghost room (logged on at 5:30),<br/>
damn group of japanese hogging the room for hours on end.<br/>
<br/>
I had died once already that night when I went LD at the zone and had a TT<br/>
& a hag on me. I was not happy, however I lost very little exp and got a<br/>
revive so all was well, we all regrouped and this time held the basement<br/>
properly, this was until the ghost room group trained and we all fled for<br/>
the zone, I think we lost a few there, I made it out this time though, the<br/>
japs then left after this so we had the ghost room to take now.<br/>
<br/>
We first took the ghost room and the ghost dropped a ring but we never<br/>
looted<br/>
because a TT popped and ran and caused a train from the torture room, this<br/>
is<br/>
where I died trying to run for the zone, had a damn hag on me and would of<br/>
made<br/>
it if I hadn&#39;t been dropping health rapidly, in the end a dusty werebat got<br/>
me =(<br/>
<br/>
We was very disorganised at first, but we then established some order and<br/>
my friend, a level 45 cleric joined us and that made the group, it was a<br/>
very well balanced group we had 2 warriors, 2 clerics a wizard and me so<br/>
dealing dmg was not a problem, most mobs barely last 10 seconds, especially<br/>
hags. 1 cast from our cleric and they were down to 10% health. With my mana<br/>
song the casters were never OOM or very low on mana either.<br/>
<br/>
After 2 ph&#39;ers we got a ghost, and he dropped the boots. We all rolled<br/>
and my friend the 45 cleric won, 20 minutes later another ghost, he had the<br/>
ring,<br/>
I won. The loot worked like this, there were 2 rolls, one for ring and one<br/>
for boots, if you won the ring roll then you are not in anymore but your<br/>
still in the boots, and vice versa. Another 20 minutes went by and another<br/>
ghost, and again boots. Now was my chance, and I rolled a Glorious 99,<br/>
woohoo. The<br/>
boots were mine, 3k&#39;s worth of loot all mine. It was 1am by this time but I<br/>
stayed to help others get boots, 20 minutes later was a PH hag, so killed<br/>
that and then the next spawn was a ghost, this went horribly wrong, he ran<br/>
and pulled the whole basement.......and most of it was on me *sighs* I<br/>
didn&#39;t last long, but I was not bothered, I had a 45 cleric res on it&#39;s<br/>
way, the group went back and found the ghost had been looted by someone, so<br/>
we never knew what loot it dropped.<br/>
<br/>
It was now past 2am and I was very tired, I got invis undead and made my<br/>
way out, only to have it fail infront of a hag and I then died again!!<br/>
*sighs*<br/>
I got yet another res and all was well, made my way out and camped. I think<br/>
I died 4 times in total, but got 3 resses, despite this I actually made<br/>
almost 2 bubs exp so I am delighted. I used to hate unrest and the exp was<br/>
shoddy, seems to pick up when you&#39;re killing loads of tough blues.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, well enough of my rambling.<br/>
