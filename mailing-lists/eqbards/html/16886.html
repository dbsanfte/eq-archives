they&#39;re experienced enough to break into the castle, they&#39;re<br/>
(usually) experienced enough to know how to do it without<br/>

<br/>
The biggest cause of trains in MM is letting a runner (usually<br/>
a familiar) get away.  If that happens, it goes right into the<br/>
castle triggering everything inside.  The sick thing is that<br/>
there are a couple familiars, guards, etc who patrol the<br/>
graveyard and the pond area.  If you aggro these (being close<br/>
to them is enough), they don&#39;t even stop to fight - they run<br/>
straight for the castle.  I&#39;ve even tried charming one and it<br/>
kept right on running.  I&#39;ve had this happen countless times<br/>
to me, and watched it happen countless times while invis.  <br/>
It&#39;s really one of the most realistic but most un-fun parts of<br/>
the game.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>None of the mobs in Mistmoore can inherently see invis.  They<br/>
can however cast see invis on themselves and other mobs.  <br/>
Don&#39;t assume invis will make you safe.  Be ready to zone at a<br/>
moment&#39;s notice.<br/>
