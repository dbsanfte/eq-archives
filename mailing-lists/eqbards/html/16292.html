<b>Subject:</b> Trying out Asheron&#39;s Call (Way off topic but I had to post this) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-894235522">My server has been on the blink recently so I haven&#39;t been getting any<br/>
eqbard emails.  Got a flood of them today now that its working finally.<br/>
Thought I would comment on this topic as well.<br/>
<br/>
My RL best friend bought AC and convinced me to buy it as well.  The price<br/>
was only $25 at COMPUSA and you get a month free so I figured even if I<br/>
didn&#39;t like it I would get my money&#39;s worth.  After playing it for the past<br/>
few days and getting my character up to 5th level, all I can say right now<br/>
is that I am thoroughly enjoying the game.  I played Rolemaster a lot in<br/>
college and the way the stats and skills work in AC are very similar.  And<br/>
on the topic of stats and skills, they actually work.  When you increase any<br/>
of these you get noticeable<br/>
effects.  <br/>
<br/>
The original poster covered most of the pros and cons so I won&#39;t go into<br/>
those.  As it stands right now, I&#39;m going to keep my EQ account active for<br/>
now but I think, in the near future, I will end up spending most of my time<br/>
playing AC.  Here are the key factors why:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Get to play with my best friend online.  <br/>
2)  AC is much better than EQ for casual gamers.  If you don&#39;t have but an<br/>
hour or two to play, you can still log in and accomplish something.  Soloing<br/>
is a viable alternative, whether outside or in a dungeon.<br/>
3)  No overcrowding and therefore no fighting over spawns.<br/>
4)  Fast respawn rate.  In the places I&#39;ve been so far, the respawn rate is<br/>
somewhere around 5 minutes.  Basically nonstop action no matter where you<br/>
are at.<br/>
5)  No camping.  Loot is randomized based on the level of the mob you are<br/>
fighting. <br/>
6)  No hell levels!!<br/>
7)  No EXP loss when dying.  Vitae penalty worked off gradually as you kill<br/>
more mobs.  Plus you keep almost all of your equipment when.<br/>
8)  Dungeon crawl mode of adventuring is the standard.<br/>
<br/>
So if these issues are more important to you than having a bank to store<br/>
stuff, traditional fantasy classes/monsters, secure trading windows, and a<br/>
better chat interface, then you might enjoy AC.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone decides to give it a try, look me up on the Morningthaw server.<br/>
