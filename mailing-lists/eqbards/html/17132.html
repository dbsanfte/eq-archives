<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130275060">hehe, I had a rather unusual night last night that I though I&#39;d share with<br/>
you.  Since the servers had been repopped, there were raids planned on<br/>
Prexus to simultaneously take out Vox and Naggy.  I got invited into the Vox<br/>
run (my second dragon invite, first time I accepted).  This focus of the Vox<br/>
raid seemed to be to give a bunch of people who had never seen a dragon a<br/>
chance to kill one, with which dragon politics being what they are seem<br/>
pretty darn reasonable ;).<br/>
<br/>
We ended up with 6 full groups and proceeded to the &quot;buff point&quot; to prepare<br/>
to engage Vox.  *Sign #1* Bert and another server go down, the chat server<br/>
fills up and we find ourselves unable to create a chat room and proceed with<br/>
buffing.  After about an hour or hour and a half, the servers come back up<br/>
and the chat server goes back to semi-normal operation.  We start buffing<br/>
with only one buff party which tends to go extremely slow when you have<br/>
about 40 people to buff.  Then another shaman shows up and we put together<br/>
another buffing party (listen to this one: shaman dies, necro summons corpse<br/>
to buff spot, shaman gets res, hehe, shaman joins us past the giants :) ).<br/>
Finally we are all buffed and camped out by around 11:00PM.<br/>
<br/>
We all logged back in, created groups and charged Vox!  Being a bard, of<br/>
course I was assigned a tank party, although my party was practically all<br/>
first timers.  With the initial hit of dragon breath, every member of my<br/>
party but 2 tanks goes LD.  By about the 4 wave of breath and I was the only<br/>
non-Link Dead member of my party left.  Hehe, I lasted until she was about<br/>
15% alive before I finally dropped (my songs seemed to do great).  Only<br/>
thing I can think of is that my party didn&#39;t head the advice to turn off ALL<br/>
chat including NPC spells :(.  At about 5%, Vox got off a complete heal and<br/>
then got trained to the bind point and proceeded to wreak major chaos.<br/>
<br/>
About an hour and a half later, corpse recovery is complete and we decide to<br/>
call it a night and go after Vox again the next night.  I get a teleport to<br/>
Lavastorm when a second try on Naggy is currently being organized.  Hehe, I<br/>
get an invite into this one as well (bards! hehe).  Figure, what the heck, I<br/>
wanna see a dead dragon!  We head on in through the Fire Giant palace and<br/>
proceed to buff up and camp.  By now, we are pushing 4AM.  *Sign #2* We get<br/>
organized, and then log back in to go after Naggy only to find that one of<br/>
the clerics for the tank group disappeared (probably fell asleep in the chat<br/>
room).  We proceed to camp out again to wait for a replacement cleric to<br/>
show.  Cleric arrives at Sol B and *Sign #3* Cerfnet goes belly up and all<br/>
the server goes down.<br/>
<br/>
So now I&#39;m currently camped at the entrance to Naggy&#39;s lair with a full<br/>
respawn of Fire Giants just waiting to pound on me when I log back in :).<br/>
I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m going to get a shot at at least one of the 2 dragons again<br/>
tonight :).  Hopefully it will go more smoothly this time :).<br/>
