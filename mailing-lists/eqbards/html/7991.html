<div id="ygrps-yiv-163770017"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Get a party together and hit permafrost.  <br/>
&gt;The gobs there drop medium bronze.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I held the king room last night for 4 hours with a druid friend<br/>
of mine.  <br/>
<br/>
Total goblins killed = (20 min spawn for 5 goblins, 15 goblins per<br/>
hour, 60 goblins total - we killed each under 30 seconds so yes<br/>
technicially while the goblin lives the spawn counter doesnt start<br/>
over, so this is an estimate =P )<br/>
<br/>
Total bronze pieces:  2.<br/>
<br/>
The bronze load is _not_ common as some people think, it is uncommon<br/>
load (I assume I just got unlucky this night, so I wont mark it rare)<br/>
But this isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve camped the room and seen little or<br/>
no bronze.<br/>
<br/>
One hour in SolB, I had a complete suit save legs.<br/>
