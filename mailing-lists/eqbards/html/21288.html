<div id="ygrps-yiv-564331081"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;However if my guild said &quot;Hey Elf, we&#39;ve decided to<br/>
&gt;move the guild to xxxxxxxx (anarchy online, asheron&#39;s call, UO2, Diablo2,<br/>
&gt;Icewind Dale, whatever)&quot;  I would leave in a second. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the only thing that has kept me here this long, my friends.  One by<br/>
one they have silently dropped out or started playing once every 2-3 weeks<br/>
now.  There are a couple of holdouts still, but I have not been able to hook<br/>
up with anyone in my guild for over a month.  The one exception was when we<br/>
had a retirement party for our webmaster.<br/>
