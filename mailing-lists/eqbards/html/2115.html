&gt; However what I have found is that if you are fighting with a group of mages,<br/>
&gt; as soon as the mage does more damage than anyone else in the party, the mob<br/>
&gt; tends to immediately attack the mage.  With this song going, the mob forgets<br/>
&gt; the amount of damage that the player has done to it.  This does seem to<br/>
&gt; work, as I have saved our Enchanters butt on many occasions, he&#39;ll fire off<br/>
&gt; a chaotic feedback and suddenly the mob is on him.  I sing the song, walk up<br/>
&gt; and smack it with my dwarven axes and it&#39;s back on me.  But it also seems to<br/>
&gt; work as kind of a taunt skill.  If the mob resists the song, it enrages the<br/>
&gt; mob and it will usually turn on you and start attacking you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because the mob forgets about everything everyone has<br/>
done to it, EXCEPT YOU.  It remembers that you&#39;ve been putting<br/>
it to sleep for the last 5 minutes so it REALLY wants to kill<br/>
you.  I suppose this could be used to some advantage with two<br/>
bards trading off singing it, but I only use this effect of<br/>
the lullaby in dire situations (e.g. that mob is hell-bent on<br/>
killing our healer or wizard).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you are soloing and you get jumped by a creature that is way over your<br/>

&gt; the creature doesn&#39;t resist, then it will stop and seem to sleep for about 1<br/>
&gt; round, this usually gives you enough distance to get away.  If the mob is a<br/>
&gt; spell caster, sometimes, if your lucky, you can get far enough ahead of the<br/>
&gt; mob that it won&#39;t be able to cast on you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is marginally useful when your party is in full retreat<br/>
from a train of mobs that tend to stun.  This song will<br/>
usually put enough to sleep that your party can put some<br/>
distance between you and the mobs, instead of constantly being<br/>
stunned.  Overall though I&#39;d say if you get into a situation<br/>
where you have to run, it&#39;s better to kick in Accelerando and<br/>
take off ASAP.  If you have extra time to burn, use it to<br/>
switch to a drum and/or insure that the rest of your party<br/>
gets away.  I only use this tactic underground, where<br/>
Accelerando is not an option.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;From what I had heard, it used to have an indefinate number of mobs that it<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It affects more than 4.  I&#39;ve put a train of about 15 gnolls<br/>
to sleep, much to the delight of the L6-10 folks in<br/>
Butcherblock.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The most important rule is tho, do not play it around NPC&#39;s, i.e. Vendors,<br/>
&gt; Guards, etc.  As it will affect them, it&#39;s an area effect spell, so if they<br/>
&gt; wander into it, or if you get to close to them, they will kill you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  Yup.  Those paladin guards at the Freeport bank sure<br/>
can make quick work of a L20 bard.  :-)  (I used to have<br/>
lullaby mapped to the &#39;1&#39; key, and was playing around with the<br/>
new background toggle on the &#39;~&#39; key, and accidently started<br/>
lullaby.)<br/>
