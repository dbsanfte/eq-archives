<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875917331">Egad!  I sure hope not.  WoTC has dropped the ball on everything they have<br/>
acquired thus far I think, with the possible exception of TSR.  They had all<br/>
the proprietary licenses revoked when they acquired Last Unicorn games,<br/>
effectively rendering everything LU did dead as of the end of the year.<br/>

that.  It&#39;s good to hear that Mythic was on the ball, though. I may look <br/>
into that one after all.<br/>
