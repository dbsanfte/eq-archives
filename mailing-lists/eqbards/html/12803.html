&gt; As you said it all depends on what your camping. ... If it&#39;s rare or a pain in the ass<br/>
&gt; to get to then it should go to who can use it. If it&#39;s common then it should<br/>
&gt; go to who ever wins the lotto. That&#39;s my opinion anyway.<br/>

no-drop item.  If I&#39;m in a mixed group, though, and a spawn has a common drop worth, say, 100pp or the<br/>
equivalent that I can use, and a rare drop worth 1000pp that I cannot use, I still say I should be in the<br/>
lotto for the rare drop.  I may not be able to use THAT item, but I can certainly use the 1000pp or the<br/>
trade equivalent.  Since I often have to stand in line for hours just to get into one group, I have to<br/>
live by their rules, though, which is one of the reasons I&#39;m so stinking poor.<br/>
