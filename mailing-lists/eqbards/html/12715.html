<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925760279">I am dual posting this on the EQ Bard and EQ Cleric list.<br/>
<br/>
My group was in upper Guk yesterday trying to get to the squire.<br/>
<br/>
First of all any advice?   I cannot seem to make it to him without<br/>
hitting multiple Gazz spawns (and a Ton Warrior).  I seem to remember<br/>
being able to get to him failry easily way back in my troll warrior<br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
We also ran into a repeated problem of a Froglok Apprentice, who would<br/>
agrro on our warrior (lvl 13, rest of us are 14).  This is nothing<br/>
unusal, however this wily frog would hit our puller with a DD spell,<br/>
then Run and get help (the circular room before the room with all the<br/>
weird scoffolding).  We would never do a point of damage to him before<br/>
he ran.  <br/>
The only counter we had to this was for me to go pulling with the<br/>
warrior so I could stun then root the appretince (and then let my pet<br/>
smush it).<br/>
<br/>
I found this pretty bizarre (intelligent) mob behavior.  Is this<br/>
normal?  Any better ideas of how to deal with it (having your only<br/>
healer go on a pull is not a real great idea, IMHO)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
