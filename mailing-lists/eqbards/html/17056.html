&gt; We really do not have anything that is on a primary<br/>
&gt; tier level.  The other<br/>
&gt; hybrids are also a bit weak on primary but have<br/>
&gt; additional secondaries to<br/>
&gt; make up for it.  I&#39;m just not sure being third rate<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree that we&#39;re weak in a lot of areas.  But then,<br/>
I retired my 12th lvl Shaman because I think that&#39;s an<br/>
underpowered class.  <br/>
<br/>
So why do any of us play a bard?  I&#39;d say, because<br/>
it&#39;s fun to outrun that train of orc oracles at 5th<br/>
lvl, because there&#39;s nothing cooler than starting to<br/>
heal that 6th lvl group on orc hill and have people<br/>
say: &quot;Wow!  Sweet!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about going to the beholder room and being the<br/>
charm-proofer. <br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s about passing high lvl druids in the Karanas<br/>
like they&#39;re standing still.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about dynamic buffing -- when we buff, nobody is<br/>
left out.  We can change buffs in the middle of the<br/>
fight, we are the stick shift characters of this game.<br/>
 Everybody else&#39;s spells are what the military calls<br/>
&quot;fire and forget&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tough to be a good bard...and I play for the<br/>
challenge and roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
But underpowered?  YES, YES, YES.  They really need to<br/>
make us a bit tougher.<br/>
