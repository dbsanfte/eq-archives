My experience with it was that the mooks came one at a time to me at 50<br/>
but that coulda been a bug. As for giving him the note sneak worked<br/>
like a charm. I soloed both the doppleganger and him seperately but I<br/>
wouln&#39;t do it again. What a group can do in 5 minutes took me 1.5 hours<br/>
(part of which was CR). They aren&#39;t meant to be soloed. At least not by<br/>
a bard.<br/>
