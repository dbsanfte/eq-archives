<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028958499">As I said, not everyone comes out of HK affected by the bad habits it<br/>
encourages.  But, by and large, people who group up in the Highhold/highkeep<br/>
area tend to learn two things (at least on Veeshan):<br/>
<br/>
1)  KS is ok.  I&#39;m not sure how it is on other servers but on Veeshan just<br/>
about anything goes in the orc area of highpass.  It&#39;s a huge KS festival<br/>
where no matter how long you&#39;re fighting a mob those around you will do<br/>
their best to nuke it from under you.<br/>
<br/>
2)  It&#39;s ok to pull too much, the guards are just around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
3)  It&#39;s ok to train someone, the zone is very close and/or the guards are<br/>
nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Those are just the social attitudes.  The skills that a players don&#39;t learn<br/>
or don&#39;t learn well because of these situations are critical later in life.<br/>
In short:  You can&#39;t learn the skills needed to bust a difficult spawn in a<br/>
place where you can just Guard kill the extras unless you are in a<br/>
disciplined group who actually tries to learn them.<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time in highkeep myself and left because the zone offers no<br/>
challenge.  At 14-18 the gnolls are a lot of fun but the orcs are a KS<br/>
festival and the goblins inside highkeep are good XP but a lot of groups<br/>
tend to get lazy about pulling technique etc because safety is, litterly, a<br/>
stone&#39;s throw away.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an insult against anyone.  It&#39;s a fact about that zone.  And anyone<br/>
JUST out of highkeep who&#39;s allowed their group skills to stagnate is more<br/>
dangerous than someone who went through their twenties in, say, Solusek.<br/>
<br/>
Just my oppinion but a lot of people share it.<br/>
<br/>
And it may be very different on other servers.  But on veeshan the norm is<br/>
to see a group pull too much, kill 1 then take the rest to the guards, and<br/>
break the spawn using the guards to kill off anything they can&#39;t handle each<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually Highkeep is notorious for attracting &quot;dumb players&quot; or rather<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; creates them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The total safety of the hunting there causes people to learn terrible<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; &gt; tactics (or not learn any at all).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 99% of the time if I find myself grouped with someone who levelled<br/>
through<br/>
&gt; &gt; their upper 20&#39;s and lower 30&#39;s in highkeep I immediately leave the<br/>
group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not that ALL people who played there are bad, it&#39;s that most are.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No offense to anyone who&#39;s hunted there religiously but HK just isn&#39;t<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same as SolA or GukTop or Cazic.<br/>
