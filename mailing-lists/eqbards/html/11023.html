<div id="ygrps-yiv-485060624">Playing my wizard, soloing spectres, sand giants in oasis waiting for<br/>
my friends to log on.  I use levitate to help move across the terrain.<br/>
Floating above the water, killing spectres my levitate begins to fade.<br/>
I recast, and get the &quot;You are already floating&quot; message.  Now I have<br/>
a couple options, run up to the spectre island to recast, which has<br/>
the chance of drawing more spectres to me, or run back across the<br/>
water to recast.  Standing over a lava pit when levitate starts to fade?<br/>
Running across the ocean of tears and levitate fades?  Swim to an<br/>
island.  The problem with the bard will be fixed, other<br/>
classes have been nerfed. <br/>
<br/>
My levitate lasts just over 15 minutes, so when my leader is pulling<br/>
cyclops for us, I like to keep levitate up on him so he can pull<br/>
better.  Now levitate has to be out before I can recast, or I have<br/>
to tell him to drop it, then wait for him to respond, then recast.<br/>
<br/>
They have definitely found a very rude way to fix a very small problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that the same problem exists with enduring breath also, <br/>
which I haven&#39;t been able to verify.  Can you imagine having this<br/>
go out in Kedge?  You would have to recast aftr it fades while you are<br/>
running out of breath, how fun.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes it is broken for all classes, but... The other classes still have a <br/>
&gt; &gt; usuable spell, while our song is completely worthless till they fix it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t understand why you all think it&#39;s broken for casters?<br/>
&gt;   They cannot cast levitate on themselves while they are already<br/>
&gt;   levitating - so what?  They never did that before, that I can<br/>
&gt;   tell.  You lose lev, remem lev, and recast lev.  The only person<br/>
&gt;   I saw jamming on levitate like 50 times was a GM to make him rise<br/>
&gt;   high above anyone.  And it&#39;s my belief why they attempted to <br/>
&gt;   correct levitate due to the people who would levitate themselves <br/>
&gt;   over and over to heights where they could easily overcome obstacles.<br/>
&gt;   (The ledge in Permafrost to Lady Vox comes to mind)<br/>
