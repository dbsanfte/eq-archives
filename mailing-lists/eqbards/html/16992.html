&gt; &gt; Some effects (like Accelerando) are client side, so aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; affected by this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are probably right about them getting out of sync but I&#39;ve even seen<br/>
&gt; it happen with Selo&#39;s. I&#39;ve had the fading of the SoW icon actually slow<br/>
&gt; me down while playing Selo&#39;s. I think it was back when Selo&#39;s would<br/>
&gt; override SoW but the icon stayed up. When the icon for SoW faded I<br/>
&gt; actually slowed down until the next Selo&#39;s pulse, dispite the fact that<br/>
&gt; SoW had been overridden.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, Accelerando will slow down to non-drum speed whenver<br/>
you lose a buff, gain a buff, or zone.  I think these events<br/>
cause a reappraisal of what buffs you currently have on, and<br/>
the spdata.eff file lists song effects without instruments.  <br/>
So when your buffs are reappraised, the song effects get set<br/>
back to non-instrument values (need to test this with a buff<br/>
song).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s usually not a problem because our songs refresh so<br/>
quickly.  It&#39;s annoying enough that I /bugged it a long time<br/>
ago though.<br/>
