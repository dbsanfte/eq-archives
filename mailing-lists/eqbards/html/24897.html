<div id="ygrps-yiv-69581004">You have to talk to the Marshall in the bank in Rivervale.  Ask him &quot;am I<br/>
one with the wall&quot;.  If you are you get a squad ring (lore, no drop).  It<br/>
has one 80-100hp heal.  You will take a big faction hit against guardians<br/>
of the veil when you get the ring (warmly to amiable).  This was to keep<br/>
people from doing the quest multiple times when the ring was no-drop.  Who<br/>
knows why they left in now...that&#39;s Verant.  Recharge the ring in the<br/>
cleric&#39;s guild from Hendri Mruble(sp?).  Make sure you use CCC on her prior<br/>
to trying to get the ring recharged, she has been known to take it and keep<br/>
it...&quot;I will not help beings like you&quot;.  You have to kill tons of goblins<br/>
to get your faction high enough.  4-5 hours for 2 days isn&#39;t even a drop in<br/>
the faction bucket for this.<br/>

&gt;/em curses the squad ring profusely<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have yet to get mine even after having a pet run all over those goblins<br/>
&gt;for probably 4 or 5 hours for maybe 2 days. Even with Collaboration I still<br/>
&gt;dont get the ring.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Talies - an update<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I decided that since I was still a low-level (sort-of, 11th), I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;delete Talies and recreate him.  Why?  Because I wasn&#39;t happy with my<br/>
&gt;choice of religions.  In order to be able to visit anywhere, I decided that<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d better work without any religion at all.  Now for the fun part -<br/>
&gt;regaining my levels, *without* being powerlevelled.  It&#39;s amazing how a<br/>
&gt;well-played bard can seem like he&#39;s being power-levelled anyway ;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In 26 hours of play, I regained all 11 levels, and improved my faction<br/>
&gt;enough to be indifferent in Ak&#39;Anon (got to work on that just a wee bit<br/>
&gt;more), and in Rivervale to Amiable, probably half-way to warmly.  Still got<br/>
&gt;a long way to go to get the squad ring ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My question is - just how effective is the Carillon in situations like<br/>
&gt;this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For those of you interested, I started in Kelethin, had a friend hand me my<br/>
&gt;eq back (full-banded armour, plus a lumberjack&#39;s cap, no jewelry, a combine<br/>
&gt;long sword, Rukgus&#39;s sticker, and a Shiny Brass Shield that Talies had<br/>
&gt;fought for to begin with.  I didn&#39;t want to be &quot;twinked&quot; - I worked for (or<br/>
&gt;payed hard-earned cash for) everything I have.  No freebies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I stayed in the Kelethin newbie area for a while, collecting wolf pelts and<br/>
&gt;spider silk to work on tailoring, and bone chips to sell to needy<br/>
&gt;necros.  Only died once until level 4, when I went cliff-jumping with a<br/>
&gt;crazy druid - just to see what would happen (I died ;).  At level 5, I gave<br/>
&gt;up on orc-hunting - either I&#39;d get jumped, and no one would help, or I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;have a nice yellow all alone, and someone would steal it.  I headed for the<br/>
&gt;(relative) peace of Steamfont.  Stayed there until 8th, when I headed<br/>
&gt;across the ocean to Misty Thicket (got bound in Rivervale, after 30 minutes<br/>
&gt;of asking...)  Hunted Goblins almost exclusively until 10th, when I started<br/>
&gt;mixing in other stuff for experience (and because there were a lot of<br/>
&gt;faction hunters out there significantly cutting down on the numbers of<br/>
&gt;goblins.)  BTW - Did you know that the Goblin Alchemist REALLY HURTS at<br/>
&gt;level 10?  *ouch*.  Fortunately, a 49th level Necro killed<br/>
&gt;him.  Unfortunately, for any monks out there, a 9th level Cleric decided to<br/>
&gt;take the ribcage and wear it.  *sighs* Some people&#39;s children...<br/>
&gt;In the process of gaining 11 levels, I&#39;ve kept all of my combat skills and<br/>
&gt;music skills maxed, and worked a little on baking, tailoring and<br/>
&gt;smithing.  All told, I&#39;ve made over 125 pp of pure in-the-bank profit (not<br/>
&gt;including purchases).  Not a bad haul for one weekend.<br/>
