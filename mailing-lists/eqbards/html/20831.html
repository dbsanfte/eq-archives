<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741389129">Don&#39;t know yer level, but at 37, I went and got my own (the scorp was blue,<br/>
but had a 51 Paly with me).  It&#39;s not hard as none of the critters in the<br/>
canyon can see invis, ye just invis and track one of the Scroungers (I<br/>
think) down.  Kaesora?  If ye know the area well, just head down to the<br/>
Library area and /auction for one.  If ye don&#39;t know it well, ask someone<br/>
who does to guide ye, or just /auction at the zone.  Really, it&#39;s that<br/>
simple... no, I mean it.  Honest!  ;o)<br/>

&gt; &gt; The coins are all droppable and most are fairly easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have four coins so far -- missing the Overthere and<br/>
&gt; Kaesora coins.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I auctioned for the coin in the overthere and a 40th<br/>
&gt; magician offered to sell me the Dalnir&#39;s coin.<br/>
&gt; apparently somebody had purchased his last coin for<br/>
&gt; 100 pp and he figured I&#39;d pay the same;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far the most I&#39;ve paid is 20 pp and that was to a<br/>
&gt; friend who needed a port so he could get it from the<br/>
&gt; bank.  Amazing what some people will pay for an old<br/>
&gt; coin ...<br/>
