<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783130761">Our melee class have haste items, our enchanters cast Swift Like the Wind<br/>
for haste (bard song does not stack) for serious battles. Resolution is good<br/>
too - esp for long fights where stamina loss is a factor.  Amazingly, higher<br/>
level bard&#39;s can use Jig of Vigor to help replace stamina lost by long<br/>
fights (or Plane of Sky mobs that cast AE drain stamina.)  I would be<br/>
interested to see the difference in damage done by the various melee classes<br/>
at full stamina vs 50% loss, 75% loss & 90% loss.  My gut reaction is that<br/>
it is significant.  This could be a real nice song to play especially if you<br/>
have 3 real tanks in your group and could be helpful at many levels.<br/>

&gt; I like the idea, but 18 seconds?  At level 49?  Is that really worthwhile?<br/>
&gt; Won&#39;t most 49+ groups already have haste items for the tanks that this<br/>
