<div id="ygrps-yiv-948352374">Another digest person so I am making comments on various subjects here:<br/>
1) My husband has a L40 paladin currently living in Guk Bottom, and he tells <br/>
me all the time how they are complaining about the bards being overpowered, <br/>
so take heart! We will rule one day! They even have a rumor about bards <br/>
being toned down once again. (aakk!) I do know that when one of their band <br/>
fell off the bridge into deeper parts of the dungeon, they had to get a high <br/>
level bard to go with them to recover it.<br/>
2) I live down south, as in North Carolina and you don&#39;t even want to know <br/>
how we feel about Yankees, especially ones who move here. :)<br/>
I am a female and play a female wood elf bard on Xegony.<br/>
3)The tip about Selo&#39;s breaking root is wonderful! We were hunting gob and <br/>
gnoll shamans yesterday and they wanted badly to root myself and my <br/>
barbarian warrior partner. Selos broke us loose each time.<br/>
4) Throwing is great. I carry shurikens all the time and use them <br/>
constantly. Try hunting &#39;an orc warriors&#39; and priests (do not get the &#39;a orc <br/>
warriors&#39; they are around L20) with a partner in the north west corner of <br/>
Oasis. They give rawhide armor and rusty plus the occasionaly bronze <br/>
weapons. This is a bard area for sure cause you need speed and throw to <br/>
fetch the orcs back to the zone wall so the sand giants won&#39;t get you. I <br/>
went from L10 to 15 there.<br/>
<br/>
