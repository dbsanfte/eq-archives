<div id="ygrps-yiv-234246757"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;2.  What&#39;s up with Farie Dragons?  The little guys with butterfly wings.  Are <br/>
&gt;they monsters to hunt?  Do they have a bad faction adjustment when killed.  Do <br/>
&gt;they have good treasure?  No one seems to be hunting them.  Yes they&#39;re <br/>
&gt;beautiful but that doesn&#39;t seem to stop most people.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They reduce your faction with SkyTalons, whatever that is.  (Dragons maybe?)<br/>
<br/>
They sometimes have a gem or piece of jewelry.  No cash.<br/>
