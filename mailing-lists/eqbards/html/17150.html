I guess I missed that they survive just fine without you. Although I stand<br/>
by my statement. Of course it is possible to go to sol a without a tank a be<br/>
ok, there&#39;s just no way I&#39;d do it. Usually equates to one dead bard. (me) Of<br/>
course by the time you hit 25-27 you can survive just fine there.<br/>
<br/>
I first went to sol a at level 20, and then again at 22. The first time was<br/>
just way too early. At 22, we had a well balanced party (enchanter 23, bard<br/>
23, bard 22 (me), sk 20, necro 19, druid ?) we were able to break and take<br/>
the singe room and hold it for 3 or 4 hours. It was a lot of fun, but I<br/>
chalked up the positive experience to having a good party that was really<br/>
working well together. After that night, I didn&#39;t go back till 25, but once<br/>
25, I parked myself for the ride of a lifetime. We have a truly amazing<br/>
puller who is capable of pulling a non stop stream of endless blues. Exp was<br/>
flowing like water. (approx a bub an hour) But anyway, I digress.<br/>
<br/>
If you are commited to staying in sol a and no one is willing to start up a<br/>
tank, then recruit one from outside your group. There are plenty of tanks in<br/>
the game, and they are more dependant on the other classes than the casters<br/>
so they are generally looking for a group.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;well, learning more of your story, I whole heartedly agree.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;You cannot go to sol a with no tanks at that level. Simply can&#39;t be done.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like your later points, but this is totally untrue.  My point was they do<br/>
succeed just as well in Sol A without me.  Only difference is they take<br/>
turns seeing who dies once per night instead of me every night.  They get<br/>
just as much xp and loot in the same amount of time.  They don&#39;t need a tank<br/>
in Sol A and having someone who can only tank and not very well just means<br/>
that person gets to be the nightly martyr who dies in the bad pull.  Might<br/>
as well have it be a caster who can be back in 30 seconds.<br/>
