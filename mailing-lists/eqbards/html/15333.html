<div id="ygrps-yiv-288068600">ACK!  You can nod red Rooks at level 18?  Verant come quick!  Nerf!  Nerf!<br/>
I couldn&#39;t nod a pack of blue lizards in Cazic-Thule at level 30-32.  That<br/>
would have been a death sentence!<br/>

What someone needs to do is start a new bard on Test and run her up to 50<br/>
testing Lullaby the whole way.  I nominate John(tm).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hmmm maybe I had a streak of very good luck last night.  I was in<br/>
&gt; the penthouse<br/>
&gt; in the Aviak city and I had rooks nodding off left and right when<br/>
&gt; we got in<br/>
&gt; trouble.  I was the lowest level up there at 18 and was not using any<br/>
&gt; instruments.  The sleeping rooks would occasionally wake up swing<br/>
&gt; at me then<br/>
&gt; nod back off.  I just had to be sure I told the others to leave<br/>
&gt; them alone and<br/>
&gt; let them sleep.  The rooks were red to me.  At one time we had a<br/>
&gt; Harrier that<br/>
&gt; we were attacking and 2 sleeping rooks.  Sure sounds to me like<br/>
&gt; it is working<br/>
&gt; properly.<br/>
