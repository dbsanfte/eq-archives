<div id="ygrps-yiv-166957037">At around the late teens, you&#39;ll start getting an additional damage bonus,<br/>
depending on your strength and weapons skills and offense. I started seeing<br/>
mine about 18th, with Anthem and Warsong going.  It goes up slowly but<br/>
surely<br/>
<br/>
With a 5 damage well balanced scimitar, at 29th level, I&#39;m hitting for 16.<br/>
With a 6 damage WB rapier, I&#39;m hitting for 19, and with a 7 damage barbed<br/>
leather whip or 7 damage Jambiya,  I&#39;m hitting for 22.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that&#39;s SERRATED bone dirk btw,  it&#39;s an 8 damage weapon, (but casts<br/>
Engulfing Darkness) and it&#39;s rogue only.  And more importantly, it&#39;s<br/>
PIERCING.<br/>
<br/>
The guy that runs EQ&#39;lizer probably hasn&#39;t seen any of those toys in real<br/>
life, and half his information is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Another little tidbit, this right from Ryan Palachio (Head tuning GM).<br/>
Since the start of retail, STR affects not only how much you can carry and<br/>
how hard you hit, but also how WELL you hit.<br/>
<br/>
 DEX is still a factor in accuracy, but now STR is worked on both sides of<br/>
the combat equation, To-Hit and Damage.<br/>
<br/>
As far as your DPS formula goes, I think you&#39;d be better served simply<br/>
dividing the base damage by the delay, it&#39;s a better real world indicator.<br/>
<br/>
 Ah, hell, tired of typing, here&#39;s a cut and paste from a post I made on the<br/>
EQ Beta board back in November.  Some of the weapon stats have changed due<br/>
to tuning, but it&#39;s still  accurate.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of numbers here, don&#39;t read if you&#39;re not into that sorta thing. VERY<br/>
LONG POST!!<br/>

In Response To: I&#39;ve got to disagree (Kiro)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just can&#39;t agree with you here Kendrick. I&#39;ve heard you talk about speed<br/>
&gt; being a principle factor in your weapon selection before - but you cannot<br/>
&gt; ignore a higher damager &quot;per click&quot; capacity of the mino axe.<br/>
&gt; This will be obvious to most everyone, but evaluate the weapon based on<br/>
&gt; the amount of time (speed factor time) that is takes the weapon to inflict<br/>
&gt; 1 point of damage. For the longsword this is 4.8333 clicks - for the mino<br/>
&gt; axe it is 4.625 clicks and for the combine longsword (as a reference) it<br/>
&gt; is 4.667.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now - from those numbers, you can see that a mino axe will outdistance<br/>
&gt; both the longsword and the combine longsword in damage. I recognize the<br/>
&gt; speed advantage in giving better averaged damage in any one combat - but<br/>
&gt; if you give the mino axe enough time, it will come out ahead. Instead of<br/>
&gt; basing your weapon decision on ONE combat, base it on a lifetime. The mino<br/>
&gt; axe will far exceed the longsword and combine longsword in damage over a 4<br/>
&gt; level lifetime with that weapon (then you need the combine for it&#39;s magic<br/>
&gt; capabilities).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is one big factor that skews the straight time vs damage calculations:<br/>
<br/>
Higher attack speed means more chances of processing dual attack and or<br/>
wield.<br/>
<br/>
Once those two skills come into play, faster weapons take a large leap<br/>
forward in overall efficiency. I&#39;d much rather have the system check every 3<br/>
seconds if I get an additional attack(s) than I would every 5 seconds. Those<br/>
are arbitrary time factors, but you get the point. A longsword checks every<br/>
29 units, to see if you swing twice, or use your secondary...a mino axe<br/>
checks every 38 units. Probability is in favor of the faster weapon here.<br/>
<br/>
Before that time, lower offense/weapons skills mean you miss more. So,<br/>
swinging more IS a good thing, be it one combat, or one hundred combats.<br/>
Hitting a target has a large random component, stacking the odds more in<br/>
your favor never hurts. Not to mention faster swings means faster skill<br/>
increases, something not to be overlooked.<br/>
<br/>
When you jump the gap, and go to 2h weapons, well, they ARE more efficient.<br/>
They have to be, to make up for the loss of either a shield or a secondary<br/>
weapon, and are purpose designed to be the most devastating weapons in the<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll note also, that the &#39;good&#39; weapons break a couple of rules, they have<br/>
higher base damage, and higher speed, with the level 40-50 stuff having<br/>
damage numbers half that of their attack speed, more or less. You&#39;ll not be<br/>
likely to see any weapons with more than .50 efficiency in players hands.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, to find the efficiency rating (as I call it) of a given weapon, divide<br/>
its base damage by it&#39;s attack speed.<br/>
<br/>
3/20 Dagger .150<br/>
4/23 Short Sword .170<br/>
5/25 Rapier/Scimitar .200<br/>
7/35 Battle Axe .200<br/>
6/29 Longsword/Spear .206<br/>
8/39 Bastard sword .205<br/>
8/38 Mino axe .210,<br/>
6/28 Combine longsword .214,<br/>
5/23 Combine rapier .217,<br/>
6/27 Combine spear .222<br/>
7/28 Barbed leather whip .250,<br/>
6/25 Stiletto of Bloodclaw .24,<br/>
8/35 Screaming Mace .228<br/>
12/43 Combine 2h .270<br/>
14/50 Halberd .280<br/>
14/43 Dwarven Greataxe/Bloodstained Sword .325<br/>
16/35 Gigantic Zwiehander .457<br/>
11/22 Fanged Skull Stiletto .50<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just a listing of a weapon&#39;s optimum efficiency level. You&#39;ll note<br/>
though, that a bastard sword is a hair worse than a longsword, a mino axe a<br/>
hair better, and neither do as well as a combine longsword.<br/>
<br/>
Another calculation you can do, which gives you a better &#39;real world&#39;<br/>
indication of how good a weapon is, is to determine a baseline weapon, I<br/>
pick steel longswords, and compare damage over any given period of time. To<br/>
do this, you take the attack speed, multiply it by the number of attacks you<br/>
want, and then multiply that number by the base damage. Lets do 100 swings<br/>
of a long sword. That takes 2900 (29 speed) time units, and yeilds 600<br/>
(100*6) damage.<br/>
<br/>
Now, take a mino axe, divide its speed, 38, by 2900. That gives you 76.3,<br/>
the amount of swings it will do in the same time period. Multiply that by 8,<br/>
the base damage. In the time it takes a longsword to swing 100 times for 600<br/>
damage, a mino axe swings 76, for 610. Ten points. Ten points in return for<br/>
23.7% less chances to hit. To figure longer spans, just add some zeros. The<br/>
gap widens a bit, 10x that time=100 more damage for the mino axe, but 240<br/>
more swings with the longsword, and so on. With bonus damage for higher<br/>
skills, the ratio is still the same.<br/>
<br/>
A regular bastard sword fares even worse, doing 74 swings, and 594 damage.<br/>
A combine longsword will do 103 swings, and 621 damage.<br/>
A combine rapier will do 126 attacks, for 630 damage.<br/>
A combine spear will do 107 attacks, and 644 damage.<br/>
A screaming mace will do 82 swings, and 662 damage.<br/>
A bloodclaw stiletto will do 116 attacks, for 696 damage.<br/>
A barbed whip will do 103 swings, and 724 damage.<br/>
A halberd will do 58 swings, and 812 damage.<br/>
A 2h combine, 67 swings, 809 damage.<br/>
A dwarven 2h greataxe or bloodstained sword will do 67 attacks, and 944<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
All of the above weapons are in the game, and in testers hands. [Note: All<br/>
numbers were rounded down] Also, the above numbers do not take into account<br/>
the advantages of dual attack/wield.<br/>
<br/>
To put this all in context, with off-the-shelf weapons, I&#39;d have no<br/>
hesitation standing a pair of 30th level players, one dual combine longsword<br/>
warrior up against a combine 2h sword or halberd wielding warrior..it&#39;d be a<br/>
close fight, and my money would be on the longsword user, all else being<br/>
equal. Were it a sword and shield vs a 2h, well, the 2h user would win.<br/>
<br/>
The rough calculation of dual attack going off is (Skill+Level)/500, the<br/>
result being a percentage.<br/>
<br/>
For dual wield, it&#39;s (Skill+Level)/600<br/>
<br/>
At 30th level, you&#39;ve got a 30% chance of getting your secondary attack in.<br/>
That&#39;s roughly 30% more damage you can inflict (and, at 30th level, you can<br/>
use that offhand weapon TWICE, if warrior or rogue). With only one secondary<br/>
attack, a dual weilding combine longsword user is almost dead even with a<br/>
single combine 2h or halberd user (807 points of damage vs 809 or 812 for<br/>
the 2h user, and of course, the dual user has a lot more swings)..if he&#39;s IS<br/>
a warrior or rogue, he does even better, approaching 1000 points damage.<br/>
This is not factoring in the increased chance over time of your primary<br/>
going off twice with a faster weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this clarifies my reasoning, and doesn&#39;t bore you to tears reading it.<br/>
And it&#39;s just this sort of thing I&#39;m really going to miss, if all the<br/>
numbers get hidden in retail. Counterpoint being, a lot of folks DON&#39;T want<br/>
to know these sort of things.<br/>

&gt;From: David Rubino &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tigger@...">tigger@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sure,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The formula is simple. First of all, a weapon has a maximum amount of<br/>
&gt;damage it can do in a single hit. This amount is (DMG * 2) + 1. Why? It<br/>
&gt;just does . . . observe your weapon&#39;s behavior. Your Mino Axe should do no<br/>
&gt;more than 17 damage (8 * 2) +1.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Obviously, you won&#39;t always do the maximum amount of damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Your STR helps determine how close to the max you hit. The higher your STR,<br/>
&gt;the more chance you&#39;ll have of hitting for the max. Your skill in the<br/>
&gt;weapon and in offense probably affects this as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, your opponent&#39;s armor will affact how much damage you hit for,<br/>
&gt;because their armor will absorb some of your damage. You will notice you do<br/>
&gt;less damage against higher level characters even when you hit them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So my formula takes the max amount of damage (DMG * 2) + 1 . . . and<br/>
&gt;divides it by the delay of a weapon in seconds (Delay / 10). Doing this you<br/>
&gt;get damage per second, which is probably better named maximum damage per<br/>
&gt;second.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Question about your formula for dps... And maybe it&#39;s a question about<br/>
&gt;&gt;damage in general...  : )<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;(damage*2)+1   Where&#39;d you get the *2?  Doesn&#39;t STR get factored in there<br/>
&gt;&gt;somewhere?  I am extremelly curious about this as I am probably over<br/>
&gt;&gt;obsessive about Stats.  : )<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;If someone could break down how my Mino Axe with a damage of 8 does 18 max<br/>
&gt;&gt;damage for me, I&#39;d appreciate it. :)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I have a base strength of 95, going as high as 112 with buffs and equip.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I sorted through the list of weapons on EQLizer for magic 1H slashing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;weapons.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The obvious ones are the combine longsword and scimtar, and their<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;well-balanced counterparts. Information on these is widely held, so I<br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;go into detail here.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; First, let me say I measure the damage value of a weapon using a stat<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;called damage per second (dps). This is calculated assuming that the<br/>
delay<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;is in tenths of a sec (I think that&#39;s about right). To calculate:<br/>
 (damage<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;* 2) + 1 ) / (delay / 10)<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please give me any info you have on any of these weapons, including<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;opinons on which is best, how hard they to obtain, how much they sell for<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;if sold, etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, if there are any missng from this list please add them. (There are<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;only 4 here). And two of those are not even confirmed as 1H slashing<br/>
magic<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;weapons.  If they are not magic and 1H slashing then I am very much<br/>
hoping<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I am missing some good ones from this list.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Barbed Whip<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 7 / Delay 28 = 5.35 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Found on the Bonrcrusher in Najena<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Casts berserker strnegth occasionally, but I don&#39;t know what this is.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Have no idea where it is found.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Crystalline Sword<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 11 / Delay 38 = 6.05 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t even know if this is magical, but I have a feeling it is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t have any idea where to find it<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t even know if it is 1H Slashing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Please help on this one, I like the stats!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Cerrated Bone Dirk<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 9 / Delay Delay 26 = 7.3 dps!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t know if it is 1H slashing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t know if it magic<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I do know it is found on the Froglock Assasin in Guk Bottom<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Just for comparison:<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Mino Axe<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 8 / Delay 37 = 4.59 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Dwarven Axe<br/>
