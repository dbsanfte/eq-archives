<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918565960">Decisions aplenty...I am a level 27 bard and I can&#39;t figure out which weapons to use. I have a barbed leather whip, dragoon dirk, demon claws, polished granite tomahawk, and screaming mace. I know I want to use my claws just cause they look so cool ; ) but they can only be worn in primary hand =( I am wondering if I should go for the dmg (barbed whip) or speed (dragoon dirk)? My 1h blunt is pretty low (27) so in my mind I have probably already ruled it out, and the PGT&#39;s shield skin song hurts more than helps at higher levels since the first hit the mob gets in when it wears offis for dmg based on your low agil. Any feedback would be appreciated!<br/>
