<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426339329">I would assume dx8.1.  I installed it, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
My first impression, I&#39;m really disappointed, overall.  I now hate the way I<br/>
look...and I see no way to change that, guess it&#39;s back to the old models<br/>
for me, and I so wanted to see everyone on horses.  :(<br/>
<br/>
I hate the bard animations.  Like someone said before, way too fast.  Still<br/>
strumming the drum, too.  I really, really, *REALLY* hate that when I sit, I<br/>
sit on my knees like a prim little princess...I&#39;m *very* ticked about that.<br/>
I see most everyone else does as well...it&#39;s fine for the female<br/>
models...but the male models really do need the indian style sit model back.<br/>
<br/>
According to specs, my machine is sufficient to load most of the new models<br/>
(15, so it says), as well as the new, hi-res textures.  Well, I hope they<br/>
make some improvements, or some system tweaks come out, because it was<br/>
borderline unplayable, when I went with the recommended setup.  Perhaps I<br/>
just need to defrag my hard drive...don&#39;t know, but nothing else performs<br/>
that badly.  I actually had times when I was turning, and everything would<br/>
stop for 7-10 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Load times...load times are rotten, horrid, and unacceptable.  No need to<br/>
set /afk anymore, just hit a zone line...you&#39;ve got plenty of time to go to<br/>
the bathroom and freshen your drink.  When I went to quit, from /camp to<br/>
character select literally took 4 or 5 minutes.  Not seemed like.  Took.<br/>
<br/>
My system?  1.0 Ghz, 256 MB Ram, Geforce 256 DDR, SB Live Xgamer, are the<br/>
important parts.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, maybe I do have to tweak my system.  I believe I still have my TnL<br/>
disabled, so I&#39;ll try that, as well as playing with the settings and<br/>
defragging...so I&#39;ll admit, it could be me...but we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been to Luclin yet.  As soon as I realized my songs were messed, I<br/>
just logged.  It took me from 6pm to 11:30pm to patch.<br/>
<br/>
It can only get better from here...<br/>

<br/>
So, which one is it? Do I need directx8.0 or directx8.1? I still do not have<br/>
SoL yet, but I should have it by weeks end, BUT I want to log onto EQ to<br/>
check and see if Dain has spawned in Icewell Keep. I&#39;ve been waiting for<br/>
over a week now to see this short little sob and he has yet to show his<br/>
face. I need him to spawn to complete my 9th Coldain Ring quest. On my way<br/>
out to work this morning I was going to see if Dain was up, so I tried to<br/>
log in real fast, but I couldn&#39;t get the patch to start. I didn&#39;t have any<br/>
time to play EQ last night. Yesterday at work, I tore myself away from my<br/>
work and emailed to my home address DirectX8 and my newest sound and video<br/>
drivers. I just need to install them now.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so now for my question, is the reason I couldn&#39;t log on this morning<br/>
because I have not downloaded DirectX yet? If so, which DirectX do I need<br/>
8.0 or 8.1?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help! My gnome warrior thanks you also!<br/>
