I had hoped we could perhaps come to agreement on this topic.  If we have a<br/>
groundswell for &quot;juggling&quot; I&#39;ll concede, in the interest of picking one word.<br/>

Other than being used to it, do you have a reason to prefer &quot;juggling&quot; over<br/>
&quot;weaving?&quot;  I&#39;d really rather be persuaded by compelling argument instead<br/>
of ultimatum.<br/>
