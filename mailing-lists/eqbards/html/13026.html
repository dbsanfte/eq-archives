&gt; Last night a group of my guildmates went frost giant hunting to get a mage <br/>

&gt; toesies), 37 cleric, 35 druid, 35 wizard, and of course the singin&#39; fool <br/>
&gt; with 37 more-or-less useful songs.  The mage whipped up a nasty pet, and <br/>
&gt; awayyyy we went.<br/>

&gt; Now, short quiz: granted you&#39;re in a group with ONE primary tank (a pet) <br/>
&gt; that is not affected by your songs, and granted you have a target that&#39;s red <br/>
&gt; to you, what would YOU do?<br/>

Clarity.  Or may Clarity &lt;other&gt; Clarity &lt;other&gt; etc.  Of<br/>
course, if they&#39;re ping ponging, you probably couldn&#39;t keep<br/>
them all in range.  Bear in mind that the higher level giants<br/>
and stuff will resist spells 100% unless they&#39;re cast within<br/>
melee range<br/>

give the druid enough extra mana to cast one extra starfire<br/>
(which is what I was doing in MM with Clarity, Hymn, and a<br/>
manastone), that&#39;s the equivalent of about 20 Bellows.  And my<br/>
songs help the rest of the group as well.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, there are still cases when Bellow has its place.  <br/>
But because it&#39;s DD and not a group enhancer, its relative<br/>
usefulness declines the more people you have in your party.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Except for some mobs that move extra fast (shadowmen, etc.) or<br/>
extra slow (beetles), everything moves at the same speed.  <br/>
Giants move at the same speed you do - walking speed if<br/>
snared.  If a mob is constantly changing direction, you need<br/>
to get perpendicular to its motion so that it&#39;s moving side to<br/>
side on your screen, not front and back.<br/>
