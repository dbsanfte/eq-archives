&gt; Well, I certainly don&#39;t do the dance. I was all excited about it when I got<br/>
&gt; to 16, but to my dismay, I don&#39;t do the dance! :( I even left my computer<br/>

kind of swing their head from side to side while shaking their<br/>
torso.  By &quot;dance,&quot; people are referring to the hop that the<br/>
males do.<br/>
