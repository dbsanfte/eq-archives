&gt; &gt;It used to be one of the most totally scary zones we had.  Even if there<br/>
&gt; &gt;were no really bad mobs in there (after level 20/25 when ghouls go green)<br/>
&gt; &gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt;was still scary - dark, foggy, ucky noises and all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmm, I was there last night and it was as dark and foggy as always.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This time, however, I had the pleasure of getting attacked by an enraged<br/>
&gt;dire wolf who was yellow to me! He triple attacked for 77,97, 93. Ouch!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was waiting for the Blair Witch to pop out. :)<br/>

the first pull a undead cleric game and right behind it was a Guide with the <br/>
name Amie The Witch!  At first I did not notice it was a Guide hehe.   Also <br/>
last night the zone was menaced by a Sand Giant sized halfling named Mennix <br/>
(my servers GM).  We also had to deal with lots of Bixie trains, other then <br/>
that it was a fun night :)<br/>
