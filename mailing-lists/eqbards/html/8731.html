<div id="ygrps-yiv-13998590">FYI those two items only give you 5 STR.  i still wear them both myself.  i<br/>
have darkmail gauntlets, but have them on my paladin as the elf-hide gloves<br/>
i feel are better for a bard.  even if i got a haste sash or thick banded<br/>
belt to replace the troll-hide i would end up giving it to my in-game<br/>
husband, a warrior who could get more use from it.  but back to the point of<br/>
those two items being 5 STR hehe:<br/>

Elf-Hide Gloves 5AGI 5DEX 4AC<br/>
Troll-Hide Belt 5STR 5STA 5AC<br/>

&gt; Since you are hanging out in Guk, try to get your hands on <br/>
&gt; the dark elf hide<br/>
&gt; gloves and the troll-hide belt.  They are bard/rogue only so <br/>
&gt; the demand isn&#39;t as<br/>
&gt; high for them.  Those two will give you ten more points to <br/>
&gt; your STR.  After I<br/>
&gt; got those two items I was able to start wearing bronze plate <br/>
&gt; and still have room<br/>
&gt; to carry stuff. </span></blockquote></div>
