<div id="ygrps-yiv-453573074">I play both a bard - and an enchanter. The two classes are amazingly<br/>
similar in what they can pull off.<br/>
<br/>
They are also the two hardest classes to play WELL.<br/>
<br/>
I started a wizard (never had a wizard before) on the newest server. The<br/>
group that I seem to have fallen into and have had the most success with<br/>
consists of Me (wizard) one paladin, one bard, a druid and TWO -yes<br/>
count&#39;em TWO enchanters. <br/>
<br/>
These enchanters are a joy to behold in action. They really REALLY know<br/>
every enchanter trick in the book.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t sound like you have an enchanter problem - sounds like you have an<br/>
idiot problem - and idiot problems know no class restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
One of THE most frustrating things for an enchanter - they do their job<br/>
perfectly - and bash happy tanks start wakin everything up. If anything,<br/>
you should be able to appreciate that as a bard. Some groups I&#39;ve been in<br/>
simply cannot comprehend ONE TARGET with all these tasty mobs just standing<br/>
there to be wacked. <br/>
<br/>
Also - their debuffing lines - and tashan series helps you as much or more<br/>
than the tanks - both in some of your songs - and direct damage with weapons.<br/>
<br/>
A good enchanter is worth their weight in gold - find a few - and make them<br/>
good friends. <br/>
<br/>
As far as overlapping duties - why is this a problem? Just make sure<br/>
everyone knows who is to do what - many hands make light work. I&#39;ve seen<br/>
this complaint before - but never seen anyone complain they have<br/>
overlapping duties as say - a TANK.<br/>
<br/>
The key to ANY class is to know not only your role - but your role in any<br/>
particular group configuration. Bards and enchanters I am convinced have<br/>
absolutely the most busywork in any party bar none. Any party (especially a<br/>
pickup group) that doesn&#39;t have a little discussion about tactics<br/>
beforehand I am really suspect of.<br/>

&gt;Hello all!  I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, and thought I&#39;d post on a<br/>
&gt;subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the incompatability of enchanters<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game that work together as<br/>
&gt;poorly as these two?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem 1: Overlapping duties.  Many Bard tasks can be done better by<br/>
&gt;Enchanters.  Crowd control, buffs, and mana regen are the big three.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem 2: Enchanters make Bard AoE songs more or less useless.  Since so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>many<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of our songs are AoE, our playlist is more limited than a Los Angeles Top 40<br/>
&gt;FM station when grouping with an enchanter.  I&#39;ve just learned on this list<br/>
&gt;that Largo does NOT wake up mezzed mobs, so I&#39;m adding that back into my<br/>
&gt;&quot;Enchanter Hotkey&quot; bank.  That&#39;s good news.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem 3: Bard invis song kills Enchanter pets / breaks charm.  Yeah,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;really the Bard&#39;s fault if they do this, and it can happen with other pet and<br/>
&gt;charm classes too.  However, there is a unique problem with Enchanters.  The<br/>
&gt;other night I got into a group in Unrest by the fountains.  One of the group<br/>
&gt;members was a casting Troll.  &quot;Shaman,&quot; I thought to myself.  Suddenly, a<br/>
&gt;typical Unrest train comes roaring by bearing half the house.  I kick in the<br/>
&gt;invis song to protect the group when the message &quot;Gebaner slashes itself for<br/>
&gt;32000 points of damage&quot; pops up, followed by a severe reaming from the<br/>
&gt;Enchanter who was in troll form.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem 4: For some reason, most Enchanters I&#39;ve grouped with are total<br/>
&gt;jackasses.  They are constantly barking orders (usually in all caps) and<br/>
&gt;yelling at everybody.  It&#39;s very rare for Enchanters to give instructions ina<br/>
&gt;polite fashion, like &quot;Hey guys, please assist the puller so I can mez the<br/>
&gt;other mobs.&quot;  They are always self-congratualtory (&quot;Heh heh my ae mez rockz,<br/>
&gt;dOOd!&quot;) and showing off (&quot;Look, I&#39;m a table, d00dz!&quot; followed 1 minute later<br/>
&gt;by &quot;OOM&quot;).  They seem to be surly most of the time, I can&#39;t imagine them<br/>
&gt;having any fun with all their gripes.  And oh, if something goes wrong in<br/>
&gt;battle, it&#39;s NEVER their fault.  They point fingers all the time.  It&#39;s very<br/>
&gt;rare for an enchanter to say &quot;Sorry guys, I mezzed the wrong mob.&quot;  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;usually &quot;My Mez wore off that mob!!!  Somebody must have attacked it!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Idiots!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It was probably one of those retarded bard songs!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong, Enchanters are a great class.  They can enable any group<br/>
&gt;to handle mobs that would be unattainable otherwise.  And there are some good<br/>
&gt;apples in the bunch who can play their role well without being a jerk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anybody have any tips on how a Bard and Enchanter can group together<br/>
&gt;successfully and work with each other rather against?  Right now, whenever an<br/>
&gt;enchanter is in my group, I feel like an underpowered tank, which is not a<br/>
