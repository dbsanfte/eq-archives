<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Back on-topic - &quot;Twisting&quot; songs... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162462964">My set-up is somewhat similiar, but I rarely use Hymn anymore unless I&#39;m<br/>
soloing. I frequently play Soothing thru the fight if needed (it last 3<br/>
ticks unlike Clarity and has better range) by switching out my lute.<br/>
<br/>
In places like Seb my cleric with have C2 and still be asking for manna<br/>
song. Those froggies hit hard.<br/>
<br/>
As for battle songs, VoV, Bind and Niv&#39;s are good if you&#39;re playing<br/>
Chanter. If I have both Chanter and Shammy I usually Dot and Sooth. SOS is<br/>
interesting but with no message back, it&#39;s too hard for me or my group to<br/>
see my contribution.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally I&#39;ll sing a Psalm for MR, Mob de-buff (hate DSes :-)or what<br/>
have you.<br/>
<br/>
So basically I have 4 hot pads set-up for songs. One like Chris for<br/>
straight twisting, one for switching instruments/weapons, one for Crowd<br/>
Control with pet commands/announcements and one for pulling (&quot;TRAIN!&quot;<br/>
Lol).<br/>

I don&#39;t manasong during battle, at this point.&nbsp; No battle should take<br/>
long enough to require it, so it doesn&#39;t get twisted.&nbsp; I&#39;m adamant<br/>
about it, since I spend downtime twisting it and hymn.<br/>
