<div id="ygrps-yiv-838592316">OK, cool.<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate all of your comments about my unfortunate human banded<br/>
helm situation.  I think that I will probably try to obtain a Turban from<br/>
the Sand Giant.  I looked it up and the turban gives +10 to AC with almost<br/>
no weight.  Does anyone know how much they generally sell for, so I can<br/>
start saving my plats... or gather sympathetic party to hunt with me?  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love trolls&#39;, and barbarians&#39; plate helms. They should get a special rare<br/>
attack where they impale their victim&#39;s on their horns.<br/>
<br/>
Dwarven plate helms are good too, little spikey things.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE half-elven plate helms, they are very Flash Gordon. Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
Wood elven males look great I think, I realize the little wings might not be<br/>
macho, but it is surely better than the girls.<br/>
<br/>
Dark elves of course has that hideous skull thing going, which although<br/>
ugly, I think looks GREAT and is very befitting of their class.<br/>
<br/>
Halflings and gnomes in plate end up looking like a little tin can, but<br/>
still neat looking.<br/>
<br/>
Lowest ranking helm looks are humans, and wood elven girls. They both look<br/>
like a pencil eraser. Wood elven girls look like a trash can with Spock<br/>
ears. Just really bad. ;)<br/>
