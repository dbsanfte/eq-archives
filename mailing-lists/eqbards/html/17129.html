<div id="ygrps-yiv-234389554">Well Kit if they do not need you then go solo :)  Over the weekend I just<br/>
though a guildmate of mine how to do the all instrument solo in Sk, she can<br/>
now easily take down Aviak Rooks without breaking a sweat.  In 2-3 hours of<br/>
soloing blues in SK you should be able to gain a level in a week on your<br/>
schedule, your only limiting factor will be finding targets, haha.<br/>

&gt; Bards are wonderfully powerful if there are no casters around.<br/>
&gt; My group is just the opposite, there are no non-casters <br/>
&gt; around, guild wide<br/>
&gt; pretty much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am 23rd level.  I don&#39;t play enough hours to gain even two <br/>
&gt; levels in 3<br/>
&gt; weeks though.<br/>
&gt; I like Sol A a lot, but I can&#39;t be effective in Sol A.  I <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t really tank<br/>
&gt; and if a group is caster heavy they really have no other use <br/>
&gt; for me.  This<br/>
&gt; has done nothing but continue to foster my opinion that melee <br/>
&gt; classes are<br/>
&gt; not useful until you get to the level where they artificially <br/>
&gt; created a use<br/>
&gt; for them by giving critters insane resists.  The cleric can <br/>
&gt; tank as well for<br/>
&gt; this group as I can.  His heals of himself when he tanks are <br/>
&gt; sufficient<br/>
&gt; taunt to keep the mobs on him and the other casters can <br/>
&gt; easily make it a<br/>
&gt; one-gob fight 90% of the time.<br/>
