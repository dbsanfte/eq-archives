<div id="ygrps-yiv-413542621">My big problem is I don&#39;t see Bind as a skill, its more of a game mechanic.<br/>
One that seriously limits what you can do.  I mean a good check is usually<br/>
this:  What would happen if all the casters in the game suddenly decided not<br/>
to bind anyone they did not know personally?  There are already many casters<br/>
who hate being bothered about getting a bind, the fact that non-casters have<br/>
no choice but to beg for a bind notwithstanding.  If a skill is so necessary<br/>
to continued play that refusal to grant it by a particular group of players<br/>
would wreck the game, you have a problem.  Maybe not one that will ever<br/>
happen given the number of available players, but try getting bound on the<br/>
test server.  With only 200 players on there at all, who you gonna find to<br/>
bind you?  Nobody, plain and simple.  That&#39;s why I stopped playing there,<br/>
though I may try again.  With a non binding-challenged class.<br/>

I&#39;ve got to concur.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s already WAY too much skill overlap IMHO.  Actually it annoys me that<br/>
ALL the casters get bind, then on top of that it annoys me that casters can<br/>
bind anywhere, where as noncasters can only bind in cities.<br/>
<br/>
The best happy medium I can think of is allow anyone to bind at Inns &<br/>
Taverns, but still only casters can cast bind.  Also, take away the bind<br/>
anywhere ability of the casters (forcing them to bind at the inns as well).<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t know, if I thought about it I&#39;m sure I could come up with some<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hate to bring this up again, but we Bards seem more like the semi-caster<br/>
&gt;&gt; shamans and clerics than the Paladins and Shadowknights.  I don&#39;t see why<br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;&gt; shouldn&#39;t have bind as a result, probably only on ourselves though.  It<br/>
&gt;&gt; could replace the leel 14 song nicely, unless they plan on making that<br/>
