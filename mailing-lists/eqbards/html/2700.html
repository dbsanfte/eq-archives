<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326996807">Actually it&#39;s more then that.  It seems we bards have become<br/>
the &quot;pony express&quot; of norrath.  Kelethin, Freeport, HighHold Keep,<br/>
and Qeynos have become the mail stops. There may be more but those were<br/>
the only ones I undertook last night. There did seem to be trouble with<br/>
the Feeport mail stop.  I believe there are also two new quests in <br/>
Qeynos but I could be mistaken and merely never triggered them before.<br/>

&gt; I was inside HighHold Keep, and there&#39;s a new bard out front, a female in<br/>
&gt; leather. She asks you to deliver some mail to Qeynos or Freeport. It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; Bard&#39;s only, but it does affect faction with the League of Antonican Bards<br/>
&gt; and their corresponding factions. --Shulzari<br/>
