&gt;And as I said yesterday, the speed boost for both the anthem<br/>
&gt;and the whistling warsong do not stack, so there&#39;s less of a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, supposedly the higher your STR the more often you will do full dmg <br/>
with your weapon when you hit a mob, or even greater than max dmg for a type <br/>
of weapon. I noticed I did 17 or 18 pts more often with a mino axe when STR <br/>
was buffed. Did it much less often without any STR.<br/>
