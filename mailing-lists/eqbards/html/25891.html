&gt;So who the hell are the partners the additional 53% of women are playing<br/>
&gt;with? Shouldn&#39;t the two numbers for the two sexes be nearly identical? Are<br/>
&gt;52% of the women lesbians, 26% playing with the other 26%?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The statistical quirk results from the difference in numbers between male <br/>
and female players.  It&#39;s possible for 69% of women to equal 16% of men, if <br/>
there are that many more men (as we see in the statistics - over 2000 men <br/>
vs less than 400 women)<br/>
