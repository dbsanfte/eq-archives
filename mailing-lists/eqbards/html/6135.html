<div id="ygrps-yiv-321120728">I play a Half-Elf and I just recently moved to some visible pieces of bronze<br/>
despite the fact that I vowed NEVER to wear that putrid orange stuff (orange<br/>
is my least favorite color).  It actually has grown on me and I really like<br/>
it, even the Hermes helm is pretty darn neat, but I guarantee I will replace<br/>
it all with steel at my earliest opportunity (feeling a bit poor after the<br/>
purchase of the bronze and 6 levels in advance worth of songs).<br/>

&gt; &gt;So...<br/>
&gt; &gt;Does anyone know if there is a helm comparable Banded that <br/>
&gt; looks different<br/>
&gt; &gt;on Humans, and where might I get one?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looks are soo important.  I was wearing Banded, Loved the <br/>
&gt; look, hated the<br/>
&gt; helm.  Of course, I hate anything that covers up my naturally <br/>
&gt; boyish good<br/>
&gt; looks ;)  But in any case, when I upgraded to Bronze (I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; only 19th, BTW -<br/>
&gt; Bronze isn&#39;t considered &quot;twinkie&quot; by this level, since so <br/>
&gt; many people are<br/>
&gt; buying and selling it) that was the UGLIEST helm I&#39;d ever <br/>
&gt; seen.  I looked<br/>
&gt; like the Rocketman :P  Fortunately, I had saved my Banded <br/>
&gt; helm, and so I<br/>
&gt; went back to it - at least it was better than Bronze.  I understand<br/>
&gt; Rubicite follows the Bronze model, in which case, I may just <br/>
&gt; dodge Rubi<br/>
&gt; helms, too :P<br/>
