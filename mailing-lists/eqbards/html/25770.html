<div id="ygrps-yiv-377115060">Hmmm.  I grouped at orc hill from 4-7 and then went to Crushbone until 10.  From there I went to the commons (soloed a bit in butcherblock first tho) -- killed orcs in the commons till 12, then I did Dervs in the west commons till 15 -- lake Rathetear until 18 -- East Karana to 19 then lake of ill omen till 30 (The front of the goblin fort is great with lament to pull, /bellows to soften them up and then all instrument twist).   Spent some time in Rathe Mtns after that learning to charm kite and then Dalnir&#39;s crypt until 33 or 34, Overthere until 36 and then EW where I soloed from 38 to 49 there.  Went to Burning Woods after that and soloed until 53.<br/>
Since then I&#39;ve usually grouped because it&#39;s much safer -- xp loss post 50 is unbelievable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;d be really great would be if a couple of real pros would list <br/>
where they soloed for each level(s) on their way up, like &quot;from 12-16 <br/>
I killed monsters in zone X through melee, then up to 20 I kited Pink <br/>
Volvo Demons who conned yellow, then...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually started my own list just to find out where to solo <br/>
at &quot;higher&quot; levels (people try to say you should give it up after <br/>
about 12th, but I prefer solo)...Soloing Everquest,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to post what I know about soloing, and data I&#39;m <br/>
accumulating, like lists of soloable MObs (monsters) for each level, <br/>
tricks for soloing better (how to automatically raise your sense <br/>
direction, forage, mend, and other skills as fast as possible, no <br/>
button-clicking required), and other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My hope is that both people with questions and people with advice <br/>
will join the list and post, and we can get a really good <br/>
infosite/faq going after a while.<br/>
