<div id="ygrps-yiv-860307788">Here is a technique that I employed while pulling multiple mobs from Unrest<br/>
Mansion last night.  This worked really well, and my party was super<br/>
receptive to my suggestions after I proved we could kick butt.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;m sneaking around the Mansion while invis, I will first of all call out<br/>
what it is I&#39;m pulling.  (usually :)  The I call the prime target... for<br/>
example<br/>
<br/>
Me:		I have a Ghoul and 2 Dark Boned Skelies... ready?<br/>
Cleric:	I&#39;m ready<br/>
Ranger:	Ready<br/>
Enchanter:	ok.<br/>
Me:		INC.... GHOUL FIRST.....<br/>
<br/>
After making this announcement, I switch from Invis to Weapons and<br/>
Selos...drag em back.  I did on several occasions use Lullabye with lute, if<br/>
I pulled too many.  And because we were already hitting one mob, the Lull<br/>
worked great.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed a lot of players around my level get really discouraged in<br/>
Unrest because of the tendency to train large groups.  Last night I changed<br/>
several of thier minds, no one died once.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the cursing, but this sort of advice is generally greeted with<br/>
&gt; a &quot;Fuck you.  Check this bossy bard out...  Don&#39;t tell me how to play my<br/>
&gt; character.&quot;, usually from a warrior or a necromancer (often Dark Elves for<br/>
&gt; some reason).  I implore my group to let me lullaby mobs and yet they<br/>
&gt; continue to, fight after fight, attack multiples.  Even if I stand there<br/>
&gt; and lull, lull, lull shouting &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;fight one&quot; they just won&#39;t do it.  This isn&#39;t just one group, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; probably 8 out of 10. It&#39;s discouraging. </span></blockquote></div>
