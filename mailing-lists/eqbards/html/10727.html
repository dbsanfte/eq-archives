<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191352082">I had a blast at this, it went real well, thanks to the druids, I died 3<br/>
times at the Druid ring :), but made it to Freeport in time.  I was near the<br/>
lead inthe charge, and made it, right behind Gnkenross who was being chased<br/>
by a skellie, I made it up to the ledge and was nailed by a Fire Elemental,<br/>
the second time was the charm for me.  This was a hoot.<br/>

&gt;I just wanted to note that I had a lot of (admittedly ridiculous) fun at<br/>
&gt;this event.  It&#39;s tough to describe for those of you who missed it, but<br/>
&gt;try and picture 60 drunken Gnomes outside the Freeport gates, waving<br/>
&gt;lutes and charging en masse to Lavastorm.  And boy, did we annoy the Dark<br/>
&gt;Elves in Nektulos!  (Did you ever notice that Dark Elves have no sense of<br/>
&gt;humor?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I actually managed to make it to the Temple of Solusek Ro ledge, where I<br/>
&gt;was able to fling myself into the lava along with perhaps twenty others<br/>
&gt;that I saw up there.  There was, sadly, a fair amount of attrition along<br/>
&gt;the way (not unexpected).  I tried to get back two more times, but kept<br/>
&gt;getting chomped by piranhas in the Nektulos river.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My roommate, who generally raises an eyebrow at this game, watched most<br/>
&gt;of it and found it hilarious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wanted to thank Aloro, et al, for organizing this, and the E&#39;ci higher<br/>
&gt;level players who spent several hours helping all of us idiots with<br/>
&gt;teleports, binding, SOW, beer and lutes.  I&#39;d appreciate it if you E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;bards could pass on my thanks.<br/>
