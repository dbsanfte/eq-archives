<b>Subject:</b> DDD worthless?  How would you change it? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-541535603"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;So, now that we all (except whee) agree it&#39;s worthless to mem, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>what changes would need to be made to make it worth memming in place <br/>
of some other song? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; by the way, what would be the reasoning behind giving us more power <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with this song?  how would it help balance the classes as a whole by <br/>
giving us more damage? shada i believe said we are already balanced <br/>
or even overpowered in the non uber raid arena.  how would this not <br/>
make us overpowered or overpower us even more in this area?  how <br/>
would this even help us in the uber raid area since most nonlure type <br/>
damage spells are heavily resisted anyway?<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the same reasoning VI used when they upgraded (lol) the <br/>
damage DDD is doing.  But, my intent with the change in topic is to <br/>
find out just what would be considered worthwhile for this song.  <br/>
Everyone is saying it sucks.  What would make it _not_ suck.  I&#39;m not <br/>
really concerned with it making us overpowered in a non-uber raid <br/>
environment... I want to find out what changes it would take for 90%+ <br/>
of the Bards to mem this song.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; we already have a targetted DD song at 55 (and 12 i guess heh).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;What would be the point of ever memming our 55 BBB (except maybe <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for the stun effect) if DDD was made single target?  Other than <br/>
having 2 songs to cycle through, but who has 2 free song slots?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; well you answered your own previous question i guess heh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of what I was thinking about as I wrote these suggested fixes <br/>
was the crappiness of BBB in comparison to the crappiness of DDD.  <br/>
Usually a one target spell does more damage than AE.  Why would we <br/>
get a song that does less damage, 12 levels later?  Sure, it has a <br/>
shorter recast so the damage over time is _almost_ equal if you&#39;re <br/>
only hitting 2 targets with DDD.  But, it seems like they should have <br/>
left DDD where it was and increased the damage that BBB puts out.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the numbers I heard were 20 mins sitting time, or 40 mins <br/>
standing time to regain 1 DDD load of mana.<br/>
