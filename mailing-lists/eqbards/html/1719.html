&gt;Early Platemail was cast from Iron, have a feeling your roomate&#39;s armor is<br/>
&gt;not quite the same as the armor I am eluding to, I&#39;m certain the knights<br/>
&gt;would be very impressed with your roomate, yet could probably pierce through<br/>
&gt;whatever she&#39;s wearing, because it sounds quite thin.  Early platemail was<br/>
&gt;so damned thick and heavy, if a knight were to be knocked from his warhorse<br/>
&gt;(horses bred specifically to be able to carry a knight) it meant likely<br/>
&gt;death, the knight trapped like a turtle on its back in the hot sun.  No one<br/>
&gt;forged stainless steel in those days.  (Come to think of it, maybe the EQ<br/>
&gt;plate is made of stainless steel.)  Little of this early armor remains, only<br/>
&gt;those pieces from especially short individuals, which no one else could fit<br/>
&gt;into, when said short individual died within it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This armour will stand up to live-steel combat, and similar models (made<br/>
with the same materials) have been tested as such.  It&#39;s far superior in<br/>
quality to the material from &quot;oh so long ago&quot;,  but there are NUMEROUS<br/>
periods we could be discussing here.  Greek-style Bell Cuirass, to Spanish<br/>
half-plate.  Gothic armor to ribbed plate.  But steel has been around MUCH<br/>
longer than I think you are aware.  Ancient Assyrians knew how to make it.<br/>
The Chinese were forging steel during the Han dynasty (400 BC)  But history<br/>
is neither here nor there - we&#39;re playing a fantasy game ;)<br/>
<br/>
  When I think platemail, I picture full plate - of which numerous examples<br/>
still remain (not the least of which were several suits belonging to Henry<br/>
VIII, a VERY large man, if his armour had anything to say about it.  This<br/>
was forged with steel (though not the stainless and spring steel my<br/>
roommate is using), and worked to a specific set of dimensions, made for a<br/>
single owner.  <br/>
<br/>
This whole idea of a knight being knocked off of his horse and dying<br/>
&quot;trapped like a turtle&quot; is patently absurd, and far far from the truth.<br/>
Even the heaviest of armour could still be sat up in, and no warrior in his<br/>
right mind would wear so much that he could not maneuver in combat. This<br/>
applies in our game as well.  Like the EverCrest comic a couple of weeks<br/>
ago, with the Wizard in full plate.  &quot;WTF?&quot;<br/>
;)<br/>
