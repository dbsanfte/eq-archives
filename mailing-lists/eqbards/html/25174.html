&gt; My 59 Bard has 127 on him, which earns me quite a bit of <br/>
&gt; derision from the newbies.  On the other hand,<br/>
&gt; the newbies didn&#39;t play for two nights before they figured <br/>
&gt; out that the the reason everyone else was so<br/>
&gt; much faster was the &quot;run&quot; button.  Nor did they wander into <br/>
&gt; Nek forest thinking how cool it was that there<br/>
&gt; were Guards to protect them, only to spend the next 3 hours <br/>
&gt; retrieving corpses.  Nor did they spend hours<br/>
&gt; of time on boats importing derv rings to GFay (1pp apiece).  <br/>
&gt; Nor were they ecstatic to buy their first<br/>
&gt; piece of Banded at level 18 (15pp for a bracer, thanks price <br/>
&gt; fixing).  Nor did they train Smithing to 125<br/>
&gt; before cntl-click (you had to move the slider down to pick <br/>
&gt; one thing off a stack).  And the list goes on.<br/>
&gt; I did rather lazily level my Warrior to 38 in 12 days, with <br/>
&gt; no help but twinked equipment, and my Druid to<br/>
&gt; 24 in 3.5 days, ditto, so a lot of it is equipment, <br/>
&gt; knowledge, and better hunting areas. </span></blockquote></div>
