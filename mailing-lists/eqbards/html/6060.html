&gt;&gt;This has probably been asked before, but HOW IN THE<br/>
&gt;&gt;WORLD can one practice Brass?  It seems that unless<br/>
&gt;&gt;you are actually damaging something, brass skill won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;go up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Arena + A brass horn + DDD + 4-8 hours = max brass skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Harmonic Distortion, 31st ding.<br/>
&gt;League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>

The cave in the tunnel between the Commonlands and Ro.  Go ALL the way in<br/>
the back, fire it up, and go to sleep.  Of course, 8 hours later, mine<br/>
STILL didn&#39;t max out - but after some time in Freeport killing rats,<br/>
beatles, bats and snakes, it was maxed ;)  *I* still can&#39;t figure out how<br/>
to practice Wind, though - Tarew&#39;s hasn&#39;t been moving my wind skill - only<br/>
Cindra&#39;s Charismatic Carrillon does, but even that is about 1/ hour :P<br/>
