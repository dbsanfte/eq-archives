<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064214261">Playing any song in downtime will cause you get the initial aggro.  Here is<br/>
what happens: the mob spawns and aggro&#39;s on anyone in your group. No one has<br/>
attack the group so they all have the same aggro level to the mob.  You song<br/>
pulses and boom! The mob sees you buffing the other 5 people it aggro&#39;d on,<br/>
go to the head of the class :)  Either that or they just do not like music,<br/>
lol.<br/>

I have gotten in two *good* yard groups in Mistmoore the last two nights,<br/>
which I hear is rare, but I have been doing well. I like to keep Selos going<br/>
(with drum) in case one of the clockwork trains catches us and we have to<br/>
zone (in fact the warriors were routinly /following me during breaks just in<br/>
case). One thing I noticed was if something spawned or someone else pulled<br/>
something it headed right for me even if they started wacking it before it<br/>
arrived to begin pummeling me. Assuming it wasn&#39;t my breath, does anyone<br/>
else notice this?<br/>
