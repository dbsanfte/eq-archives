&gt;I usually don&#39;t like telling other people what to do.  If I see<br/>
&gt;something really bad, like healers not healing when people are low I<br/>
&gt;will say something.  I also always harp on assisting the tank, but<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, I&#39;m a lot more comfortable saying something to someone else<br/>
playing a druid, enchanter, or bard (the three classes I have played<br/>
myself to highish levels) than another class.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;people never seem to figure that one out.  People do all kind of crazy<br/>
&gt;things, &quot;Damage shields are worthless&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t think you need SOW to<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I played a druid who damage shield&#39;d her monk on every pull.<br/>
and finally got convinced this is NOT best usage of mana. At least at my<br/>
level, if they are generally pulling singles, it isbetter use to cast<br/>
the DoT Stinging Swarm (about the same mana, MUCH more damage) than<br/>
Shield of Barbs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;pull.&quot;.  My reaction depends on my mood mostly.  If they want me to pull<br/>
&gt;and won&#39;t SOW me (this being my troll warrior, not my self SOWing bard),<br/>
&gt;he will just sit there till he gets a SOW or sees a mob withing bow<br/>
&gt;range.  He will not move.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Generally SoW is kept up on everyone in the party. Even if it means<br/>
lengthening downtime to get it up. But, esp when a person gets it, this<br/>
is a high mana spell. So I can at least understand why someone may<br/>
foolishly not realize how important it is when they are younger. I know,<br/>
as a druid, early On I sometimes would not cast SoW on myself, to<br/>
save the mana. Yes, the puller needs it.<br/>
<br/>
(though in Kunark, the puller has to be even more careful not to outrun what<br/>
they are pulling)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You don&#39;t want to give me hp/ac buffs?  Fine,<br/>
&gt;but don&#39;t assume I&#39;m going to keep taunting stuff off you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>About the only time I won&#39;t buff folk is when I&#39;m low on mana<br/>
and we are in a situation where we can&#39;t/won&#39;t stop pulling.<br/>
I want to make sure I have mana for healing/crowd control (depending<br/>
on whether I&#39;m playing my druid/enchanter)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I really hate getting pick up groups, but fortunatly I have a good<br/>
&gt;memory, so I know who to refuse to group with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, I have to depend on writing down problem players :(<br/>
I am more likely to remember people that I like grouping with.<br/>
