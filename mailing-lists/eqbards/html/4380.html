<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981108111">You will get differing opinions on this topic and everyone is sure that is<br/>
how it is.  The only way we can do this is by testing.   Two people of equal<br/>
level dual.  The first time,  the &#39;testee&#39; is in full bronze.  Record every<br/>
miss and hit and the damage amount.  Now have the &#39;testee&#39; remove all the<br/>
bronze armor and try to get his AC up with banded and buffs.  His AC HAS to<br/>
be with in 3 points of when he was in bronze.  Record every miss and hit and<br/>
the damage amount.  This will give you your answer one way or the other I<br/>
think.<br/>

&gt;      Now wait a minute.  How in the world is a discussion of which weapons<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      are good for bards off topic???  Lets not get carried away here.<br/>
&gt; True <br/>
&gt;      the twinking/lottery thread was way OT but lets not let that scare us<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      off of talking about stuff that is useful to all of us, especially <br/>
&gt;      those of us under 20 who rely on this list for advice to avoid making<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      painful errors.  If I hadn&#39;t joined this list I might still be<br/>
&gt; singing <br/>
&gt;      one song at a time...  )  <br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      For example I asked if Bronze Armor stopped more damage then banded <br/>
&gt;      over and above the AC increase. (which is very modest compared to its<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      weight.)  Not one answer.  This is a relevant Bard topic because we <br/>
&gt;      can&#39;t afford to put all our extra points into Strength and the <br/>
&gt;      decision to wear Bronze plate is a tough one.  Any thoughts?<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      Ok no more messages today,  I promise.<br/>

&gt; Actually the Dirk is better then a Well Balanced Rapier as well.  The WB <br/>
&gt; Rapier is 6 dam 23 delay, but no stat bonuses and wieghs over twice as<br/>
&gt; much. <br/>
&gt;   Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>
&gt; considering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  The Dirk, IMO, is the most <br/>
&gt; unbalanced weapon in the game.  But that said they can have mine when they<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; pry it from my cold, dead fingers &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Off topic just for your benefit.  Actually it is not that much off topic <br/>
&gt; &gt;since the bad is a rogue-type class and notorious for using dagger and <br/>
&gt; &gt;piercing weapons  (thats why bards have some thieving abilites).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Combine Longsword:  Damage 6,  28 delay,  hits magical creatures <br/>
&gt; &gt;Dragoon Dirk:  Damage 6,  23 delay, +2 dexterity, +3 magic.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hands down Dirk is way better.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
