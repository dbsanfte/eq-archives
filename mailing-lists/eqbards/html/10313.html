<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586795618">so now we have to add the haste sash, and whether an enchanter&#39;s spell needs<br/>
to be cast before or after we start singing.  get to work! =P  j/k, but<br/>
would be nice to know.  also, are there any cancellation effects?  will our<br/>
songs cancel the enchanter&#39;s spell, or just give the stat bonuses of the<br/>
song without the attack speedup?<br/>

&gt; &gt; have heard different things about is whether our songs will <br/>
&gt; stack with<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter&#39;s speedup spells.  i have been told yes and no.  <br/>
&gt; seeing as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter spells are a &quot;foot&quot; icon and our songs are a &quot;fist&quot; icon i<br/>
&gt; &gt; believed they do stack.  would love to know for sure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back before I reached level 36, my guild was camping the shin<br/>
&gt; lord to get 4 ghoulbanes for the 4 paladins in the<br/>
&gt; guild.  Needless to say, it got very boring so I used the time<br/>
&gt; to test this.  (I even brought a shield after the first few<br/>
&gt; nights so I could test this better. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The attack speedup of Warsong and Anthem do not stack with<br/>
&gt; Quickness, Alacrity, (enchanter) Celerity, nor Augmentation.  <br/>
&gt; The faster prevails, although I only tested it with the song<br/>
&gt; played after the spell, not vice versa.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reduction in attack delays were (1 - new_delay/old_delay):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anthem ~10%<br/>
&gt; Augmentation ~15%<br/>
&gt; Quickness ~20%<br/>
&gt; Warsong ~20%<br/>
&gt; Alacrity ~25%<br/>
&gt; (enchanter) Celerity ~33%<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve since tested bard Celerity at ~15%.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d estimate the error was about +/- 3%.<br/>
