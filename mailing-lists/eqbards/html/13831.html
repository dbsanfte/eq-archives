<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779522629">Hehe, the thing I liked about the 10-tickle whip was the proc message:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;... beams a a smile...&#39;  or is it &quot;... ahh ...feels better...&quot; or is it<br/>
both?  The proc is Life tap?  Necro bard hehe!<br/>
<br/>
For me it was more for fun.  Your BLW is a better wep.  Ashenwood short<br/>
spear is good wep for the 20ish levels.  Less weight, as good or better<br/>
ratio.  Has 10 charges of haste (never used any of mine).  Looking to your<br/>
30&#39;s I&#39;d suggest Staff o&#39; Writhing and Obsidian Shard (SoWr 48dd proc; OSh<br/>
30dd proc).  I used SoWr and Dirk for a long time.  Should have gotten that<br/>
OSh lots sooner.  By level 45 you want to be 2YK compliant but that&#39;s a<br/>
really hard prize to earn without some good (guild) help.<br/>

&gt; I noticed that during the Dual Wield thread, some of you fine Bards said<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; you use a Tentacle Whip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you feel that the low delay makes it viable?  Have you seen the proc<br/>
&gt; damage/heal be enough to be attractive? </span></blockquote></div>
