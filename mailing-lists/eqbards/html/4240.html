&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and we all know you can get rubicite without camping<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; explicitly for it.  *snicker*<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You sure have a knack for tacking things out of context and twisting them<br/>
&gt; &gt; around, John. Even if it&#39;s only in jest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *I&#39;m* taking things out of context?  When this thing first<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was just pointing out your selective underlining. It implied that he<br/>
camped just to give it to another char, when he clearly said he didn&#39;t.<br/>
Most likely you were just kidding, but I was pointing out your excellent<br/>
skill in doing what I said.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; started, I leveled the charge that harvest-twinkers who camped<br/>
&gt; at a site to get extra items or items they couldn&#39;t use for<br/>
&gt; their other lesser characters were bad for the game. Then all<br/>
&gt; of a sudden three or four people started saying I was wrong<br/>
&gt; because they&#39;re twinking with items they&#39;re not using anymore<br/>
&gt; with their main characters.  I don&#39;t know if I was too vague<br/>
&gt; in my original statements, or if these people are grasping at<br/>
&gt; whatever straws they can to justify twinking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you probably were too vague -- seeing as multiple people<br/>
(including me) have always seemed to treat this as a discussion on<br/>
twinking in general, not camping just to twink other chars. The topic of<br/>
specifically camping to twink other characters only came up yesterday,<br/>
as far as I could tell.<br/>
<br/>
So, overall, looks like just a misunderstanding due to communication<br/>
difficulties. =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to summarize, yes I agree camping just to twink other characters<br/>
is bad. However I do not think that passing down old equipment or<br/>
equipment you got but couldn&#39;t use it bad.<br/>
