Best thing to do is go look at their point system:<br/>

It will answer most of the questions that pop into you head as you think<br/>
about it. Also, note that the points assigned to mobs maybe updated<br/>
somewhere internally (ie they have more mobs listed where else - I read that<br/>
when someone from AL was telling someone else to go there and read it.)  But<br/>
in general you will see how it works for them.<br/>
<br/>
When I first saw their system - I was a bit taken aback.  But after being in<br/>
a large guild with a totally different system, I can really see some good<br/>
value in how they do it.  Our guild&#39;s policy is that loot should go to those<br/>
who both need it in that they dont have a better item and those who have<br/>
been trying to get it for the longest time.  Well, that turns into &quot;the<br/>
oldest guild memebers in the class get all the best things first.&quot;<br/>
Essentially, everyone goes on most all of our raids and we do not keep and<br/>
accurate attendance record. So, you have everyone saying: &quot;I have been on<br/>
every POH/POF/POS, Naggy, Vox, VS, DS, Trak, etc etc since I joined the<br/>
guild...&quot;  Also, our policy is that primary characters get loot before<br/>
secondarys.  Well, that becomes problematic when one gets asked to play the<br/>
secondary because that is what this raid &quot;needs.&quot; So without some point<br/>
system, who earns credit?  What happens if its your primary&#39;s turn to loot<br/>
an item and they are not active in the raid? Say you have 3 bards and one is<br/>
asked to play a cleric for VS raid.  Bard greaves drop. Do you uncamp the<br/>
primary to loot and item when 2 others of that class were fighting in the<br/>
raid?  Point systems can address these issues ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing to look at - for those of you who are interested in &#39;what<br/>
it&#39;s like to be uber&#39; is the minimum equipment requirements to join AL.<br/>
&quot;Here&#39;s a list of boring greenies we are not gonna camp for you...&quot;  But<br/>
indeed it is a list that says you are well equipped and ready for a variety<br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
One of the other &#39;uber&#39; guilds on our server has a loot policy that says<br/>
loot goes to the oldest and highest level players first.  Their focus is on<br/>
level and they leveled as many as possible to 60 as soon as possible.  That<br/>
did put them in good shpe to be doing Trak first and VS and they have been<br/>
first ones in our server to go to VP.  Their focus is different - to them<br/>
level is the number one thing.<br/>

So you guys use a point system?  I seem to remember talking about this in a<br/>
thread a while back.  We have discussed using points on and off but it<br/>
always comes down to the fear that they won&#39;t be assigned uniformly and also<br/>
that nobody would want the responsibility of maintaining such a thing.   We<br/>
use more of a deferment system.. aka peer pressure.. which seems to work<br/>
most of the time, though.  Do you like the point system? Can you use point<br/>
for any item you want or does it have to be an item that is &quot;clearly&quot; for<br/>
your class?</div>
