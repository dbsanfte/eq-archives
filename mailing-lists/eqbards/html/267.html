&gt; I have done this, and can attest that it works.  Admittedly, that<br/>
&gt; was not the aim.  I was merely waiting for a GM to help me with a<br/>
&gt; corpse lost due to a crash.  (If you&#39;re wondering, I maxed out my<br/>
&gt; fishing skill, and I was level 9 at the time).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The gold from the fish gave me enough to buy a sewing kit, and I<br/>
&gt; ventured out to get some ruined cat pelts to replace my armour.  A<br/>
&gt; weapon was easily looted from a skeleton in the newbie area.<br/>
