Stop worrying.  SPDAT.EFF is a farcical file at best.  As a matter of fact<br/>
GZ posted a bunch of false data in it _on purpose_ because they don&#39;t want<br/>
people knowing what&#39;s going in for Kunark.<br/>
<br/>
The stuff going in for test is for testing.  I seriously doubt half of<br/>
what&#39;s listed goes into final.<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Even if SPDAT.EFF were /completely/ farcical, why don&#39;t bards deserve to be<br/>
&quot;farced&quot; as much as the other classes?<br/>
<br/>
I am a bit grumpy over the fact that there are still core songs missing.<br/>
Back in May when I started my bard, it didn&#39;t bother me, because I assumed<br/>
by the time I reached 50 (two nights ago) the missing songs would be there.<br/>
Probably the most annoying thing is that before my mid-30&#39;s, most every song<br/>
I received was different than any other song I had, whereas the songs<br/>
achieved after my mid-30&#39;s are basically reincarnations or enhancements of<br/>
something I could already do.  My selection of the bard was based on his<br/>
diversity, and I just don&#39;t personally feel that my songs allow me to be any<br/>
more diverse at level 50 than I was at level 32 -- I feel that I&#39;m basically<br/>
just an improved level 32.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, I&#39;ve heard all the varying lines from GZ about the missing<br/>
songs, from &quot;coming soon&quot; to &quot;left for expansion [not meaning the expansion<br/>
pack]&quot; to &quot;the songs we have slated can&#39;t be done without some changes that<br/>
will occur with the expansion pack.&quot;  Personally, I believe GZ was blowing<br/>
smoke with that last comment, but since he said, there [*explicitive*] well<br/>
better be songs for the 3 currently missing slots.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll not going to comment on the one-every-other-level rumor, since I really<br/>
haven&#39;t heard any credentials mentioned.  However, I don&#39;t see any reason<br/>
why we shouldn&#39;t /expect/ Verant to have a new song for us for every level<br/>
in the expansion pack.  The fact that there are no bard songs on the test<br/>
server is probably most alarming simply because (1) we&#39;re still missing<br/>
songs from the core product almost one full year after release, and (2)<br/>
Niv&#39;s [47] was in the speff.dat for at least a couple months before it ever<br/>
got approved by QA and released on the live servers.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I believe we are entitled to be very worried, strictly based on<br/>
Verant&#39;s track record over the past year.  Are there going to be new songs<br/>
by expansion pack time?  I believe there will be.  Are they going to be well<br/>
thought out and creative?  Honestly, I highly doubt it.<br/>
