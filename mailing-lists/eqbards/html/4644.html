<br/>
		The canoes are even more buggy than the regular ships. It&#39;s<br/>
really horrid. A<br/>
		Bard friend of mine and I were taking a canoe from Erollisi<br/>
to Sister Isles<br/>
		and neither of us could see each other. I&#39;d constantly be<br/>
checking my LOC<br/>
		(he was navigating the boat) and I wasn&#39;t moving. Our LOC&#39;s<br/>
wouldn&#39;t match<br/>
		up (not even close). He&#39;d get to land and I&#39;d still see<br/>
myself and the boat<br/>
		out in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight. Then<br/>
all the sudden,<br/>
		*poof*. I&#39;m on land.<br/>
<br/>
		The reason I asked if you could zone in/out of OOT while<br/>
swimming is because<br/>
		I know from personal experience that you can zone from the<br/>
Oasis to South Ro<br/>
		by swimming in the water. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; You learn things from falling off of the boat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>		Yes you do. I learned how to swim rather well for one. I<br/>
learned not to go<br/>
		onto the lower deck of the boat for another.<br/>
