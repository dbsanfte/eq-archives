<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785741883">Thats interesting, that may explain why when I went home for lunch and<br/>
decided to run the patch program to see if any new patches were posted yet<br/>
and I got a couple of user manuals and addendums to the manuals in the patch<br/>
process with no explanation of why.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought it peculiar but apparently they have attempted to nip this in the<br/>
bud by overwriting the potentially infected doc files with clean ones from<br/>
the patch server.  Shhhhhhh.... ;-P<br/>

It is important that you know that the Ruins of Kunark CD *may* have <br/>
included a Word Macro virus embedded in the new documents.  If so, here is <br/>
the information on the virus:<br/>

<br/>
Now, I say &quot;may&quot; because it&#39;s possible that the infected file came from the <br/>
patch center.  In either case, Abashi has stated that if you didn&#39;t open <br/>
the doc file, you are fine.  If you did, you are SOL - Verant is keeping <br/>
mum about a solution.  Of course, you should always have a virus scanner <br/>
running (says the guy without one) and never open anything from someone you <br/>
don&#39;t know and/or trust (yadda yadda).  Thanks for shooting THAT one in the <br/>
foot, Verant :P.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you RoK&#39;ers - I&#39;m not able to upgrade, so I won&#39;t be seeing <br/>
you there.<br/>
