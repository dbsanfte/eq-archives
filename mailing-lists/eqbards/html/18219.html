&gt; Hehe, I had gone back to look at the stats last night so I have them with<br/>
me.  You&#39;re in luck.  But<br/>
&gt; first, we mostly did Mountain Giants last night.  We saw a number of new<br/>
items including a ring AC10 +10<br/>
&gt; Strength, a tunic called tree weave AC25 +10 strength wearable by just<br/>
about EVERY class and race except<br/>
&gt; pure nukers (mages/necros/wiz).  My wife&#39;s warrior got the ring which goes<br/>
great with her Efreeti ring on<br/>
&gt; her other hand.  Another warrior got the tunic.  The tunic looks like<br/>
leather so it is hilareous to see<br/>
&gt; this warrior running around in all crafted and a leather BP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The necro stuff is a Flayed Skin Tunic, AC 16 -2 charisma, +5 to all<br/>
protect,  +20 hp nec and shadow only<br/>
&gt; and the bracer was AC6 -2 char, +5 int, +5 all prot shadow and necro only<br/>
I believe.  The key though is<br/>
&gt; they could not be worn by gnomes or inkies.  I believe they are both<br/>
human/euradite only.  Both items<br/>
&gt; were looted almost back to back in Karnor.<br/>
