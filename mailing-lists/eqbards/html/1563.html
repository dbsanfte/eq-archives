&gt;&gt; Recently I&#39;ve been using the &quot;Jig&quot; (level 2 song I believe) to help mana<br/>
&gt;&gt; regrowth. I&#39;m not sure of the exact ammount (I&#39;ve heard 10%) but the<br/>
&gt;&gt; spell casters who group with me tell me that it does increase their rate<br/>
&gt;&gt; of regrowth, especially with my drum. So my theory is, it can&#39;t hurt<br/>
&gt;&gt; them with medding, they think it makes them med faster, they like me<br/>
&gt;&gt; more. Its all for the best.<br/>

&gt;Ok, I did a quick test of this with a cleric friend.  She said<br/>
&gt;meditating is really boring so she&#39;d already timed it and<br/>
&gt;figured out how it works.  She said every 8 seconds, you get a<br/>
&gt;chance to succeed at meditating.  If you succeed, your mana<br/>
&gt;jumps up by X amount (not sure how X is determined) - a pulse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With the Jig playing, it was about 6 seconds between each<br/>
&gt;meditation pulse.  These weren&#39;t attempts at accurate timings,<br/>
&gt;but the effect was obvious.  Using a drum made no difference -<br/>
&gt;6 seconds with or without.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like an unintended effect, the jig brought meditation to its<br/>
pulse rate.  See if Hymm does the same thing (it has a 6 sec pulse).<br/>
