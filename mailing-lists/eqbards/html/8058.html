&gt;&gt; Okay, I give up...  what&#39;s the difference between Song of the Sirens and<br/>
&gt;&gt; Pixie Chase?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Charm turns a monster into your pet for a short time.  Pixie<br/>
&gt;Strike simply mesmerizes it (a stun that can be broken if the<br/>
&gt;mob is attacked) for a short time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One difference the others have not mentioned is that you<br/>
&gt;cannot re-charm a mob that is already charmed.  You have to<br/>
&gt;wait for it to uncharm (and thus give it a chance to hit you),<br/>
&gt;then re-charm it.  You *can* re-strike a mob that&#39;s already<br/>
&gt;under the effect of Pixie Strike.  You can &quot;pause&quot; a mob<br/>
&gt;pretty much indefinitely by Striking it over and over,<br/>
&gt;although high blues and higher seem to resist enough to make<br/>
&gt;this a dicey strategy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually Pixie Strike has made a lvl 50 bard almost a requirement in the<br/>
new PoF. Last week our server finally broke into the PoF again after many,<br/>
many abortive attempts. We kept having to evac out when more than 2 mobs<br/>
came cause the enchanter couldnt mez the creatures without dying at some<br/>
point (they do wake up often, and a lvl 50 enchanter just cant tank :).<br/>
Then i decided to take out pixie strike and me and another bard would take<br/>
a mob each and lock them down. If the mob was blue to me, i could lock it<br/>
down almost 100%, Yellow 75%, and red about 50%. These are rough numbers,<br/>
but pretty close to the truth, if it was red both bards would gang up on it<br/>
and chain cast pixie strike. Using this tactic we took on 4 mobs at once<br/>
with 22 people, which was a huge rush for everybody. We couldnt even do<br/>
that prepatch with weaker mobs. It felt GREAT to have an immediate an<br/>
obvious use for my bard, most of our other effects are very subtle and<br/>
easily over looked. <br/>
