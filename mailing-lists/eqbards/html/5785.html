&gt; &gt; Level 44 Cassindra&#39;s Elegy - Even though this song is great that it gives<br/>
&gt; &gt; some extra INT and WIS to our caster friends, yet it is short lasting and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the extra mana given by the increase in INT/WIS doesn&#39;t help at all, so a<br/>
&gt; &gt; better usage of this song is perhaps make the effect last longer?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This was intended to be a hard song to use well. The extra Int AND Wis from<br/>
&gt; &gt; the same spell are so nice that we needed a drawback.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh. Does anyone actually use this song at all? I think they made the<br/>
&gt; drawback a bit too much, as I found the only way to use it was to play<br/>
&gt; it just before a fight, then the wizard can med up the extra int it<br/>
&gt; gets him and maybe get off one more bolt. All the casters I worked with<br/>
&gt; quickly decided it wasn&#39;t worth the extra hassle for what it gave you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seems I&#39;m arguing about this everywhere I go.<br/>
<br/>
People have this mistaken assumption that more mana = more<br/>
spells.  That is not the case.  The amount of mana a caster<br/>
has determines the number of spells he can cast without<br/>
resting/meditating.  The mana regeneration rate determines how<br/>
many spells he can cast over a given period of time.  You can<br/>
have 100 mana or 1000 mana, if your mana regeneration rate is<br/>
unchanged you will still cast the same number of spells/hour. <br/>
Thus, more mana is advantageous in a single fight; it is not<br/>
advantageous over the long term (if you use that advantage in <br/>
a single fight, you pay for it with longer downtime).<br/>
<br/>
e.g.  Your party tries to take and hold a room.  The cleric<br/>
has 500 mana.  You attack and are only able to clear the first<br/>
half of the room before the cleric is out of mana and must<br/>
meditate.  The cleric meditates.  By the time he is at full<br/>
mana, the portion of the room you&#39;ve cleared has respawned.<br/>
<br/>
The typical reaction to this type of scenario is &quot;damn, we<br/>
could&#39;ve done it if we&#39;d only had more mana.&quot;  This is not so.<br/>
Say the cleric had 1000 mana.  You attack and are able to<br/>
clear the entire room, with the cleric finishing OOM.  The<br/>
cleric meditates.  By the time he is at 500 mana, the entire<br/>
room has respawned, and now the scenario is identical to the<br/>
previous.  More mana lets you take the room once where you<br/>
could not before (single fight), but it does not enable you to<br/>
hold the room (long term).<br/>
<br/>
So I would say the use for the song is if you can forsee a<br/>
situation where you need additional mana for a single fight.<br/>
Start singing it before, let the casters top off, then start<br/>
the fight.  That should let them get one or two extra spells<br/>
in for just this one fight (after they&#39;ve cast the first few<br/>
spells, you don&#39;t need to keep the int/wis boost up).  Having<br/>
the effect last longer would be more convenient, but not<br/>
advantageous.<br/>
