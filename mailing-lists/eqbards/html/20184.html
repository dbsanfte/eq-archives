&gt;Fixed the icon for the Spectral Bow. In addition, removed &quot;BRD&quot; from the<br/>
&gt;class listing since Bards do not have the Archery Skill. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sigh, another blow to role-playing is dealt.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heh, this is hardly a blow to roleplaying.  it&#39;s called &#39;&#39;bug fix&#39;&#39;.  bards are not supposed<br/>
to be able to use bows, but someone made an error when typing this item into the<br/>
database.  it is now fixed.  bards should have never been able to wield it.  effect to<br/>
roleplaying is nil.<br/>
