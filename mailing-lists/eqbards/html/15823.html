<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-679596205">It is property, according to definitions under US Law.  One of my gaming<br/>
buddies, who is a lawyer, came up with an even more interesting proposition.<br/>
If my equipment is saleable my me, and therefore my property, if Verant<br/>
decides to deny me access to that equipment without due process, they are<br/>
guilty of denying me my own property without such due process, which is<br/>
under US law a violation of my civil rights.  I may have the wording not<br/>
entirely correct on this as it is from memory, but that&#39;s about how our<br/>
attorney gaming friend laid it out.  Interestingly as such, Verant also<br/>
cannot ban someone for anything they say while online.  Despite the fact<br/>
that it is in the TOS that you cannot say certain things without being<br/>
banned, US civil liberties laws specifically prohibit anyone from<br/>
voluntarily abrogating their own constitutional rights except in cases of<br/>
national security.<br/>
<br/>
Makes one think doesn&#39;t it.<br/>

&gt; &quot;Theft&quot; under the penal code is specific to tangible and intangible<br/>
personal<br/>
&gt; property.  Intangible personal property is specifically defined as<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; like a certificate of deposit or stock shares.  Crimes against<br/>
intellectual<br/>
&gt; property are like violation of copyright or theft of trade secrets.<br/>
Except<br/>
&gt; in the tax code, in which  &quot;intangible personal property&quot; means  &quot;a claim,<br/>
&gt; interest (other than an interest in tangible property), right, or other<br/>
&gt; thing that has value but cannot be seen, felt, weighed, measured, or<br/>
&gt; otherwi1se perceived by the senses, although its  existence may be<br/>
evidenced<br/>
&gt; by a document.&quot;  It is really, really difficult to get damages for<br/>
<br/>
So since my account is documented at Verant, wouldn&#39;t the<br/>
characters and items in my account be intangible personal<br/>
property?  Or put another way, if I sell the account, either<br/>
the IRS can tax it and it&#39;s property, or it&#39;s not property and<br/>
they can&#39;t tax it?<br/>
