&gt;earlier post, I feel that wearing Lambent should automatically reflect the<br/>
&gt;effort and time that I personally have put into my bard character by its<br/>
&gt;presence on my character&#39;s body.  This would occur if Lambent armor was NO<br/>
&gt;DROP.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s just not that simple.  No Drop solves absolutely nothing.  If it was No<br/>
drop, they&#39;d just have a level 50 friend kill the mobs that drop the quest<br/>
items while their 9th level bard stood by ready to loot.  Then they&#39;d have<br/>
their level 50 friend hand them the plat to buy the gemstones.  Then their<br/>
level 50 friend would escort them to the temple to turn in the stuff to get<br/>
the No Drop armor.  Then they&#39;d switch roles and do it for the other.  The<br/>
Lambent would be No Drop and they still would get it if they wanted to with<br/>
really not much more effort.  Unless you want to make even Plat No Drop,<br/>
which still would only slow it down, or make mobs unlootable except by the<br/>
individual that caused the most damage, which would make bards pointless<br/>
forever, there is nothing, absolutely nothing, solved by making an item No<br/>
Drop.  I a level 50 group wants they can equip each other&#39;s 1st level<br/>
newbies each with a Guise of the Deceiver and its No Drop.  I saw a level 1<br/>
dark Elf Paladin on E&#39;ci two nights ago.  If he can do it so can they.  No<br/>
Drop might make it a bit tougher, but it does nothing to make it impossible.<br/>
No Drop is the worst cop out solution I have encountered in nearly 15 years<br/>
of gaming, precisely because it does not work.  It sounds good, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t stop anything except trading in the economy.<br/>
<br/>
Verant has two really huge misconceptions that make absolutely zero sense.  <br/>
Number 1 is that No Drop is more than a minor deterrent.  Anyone that wants<br/>
to and has friends can get around No drop except where a level limit is<br/>
implied like in the planes.<br/>
Number 2 is that trade skills allow you to make money from nothing whereas<br/>
hunting does not.  Both hunting and trade skills use the same currency for<br/>
creating money, time.  Nothing more.  A level 9 can hunt Orc pawns till he<br/>
is blue in the face wit no fear of dying and make more money than he can<br/>
spending the same amount of time in a trade skill.  Why?  because Verant<br/>
can&#39;t seem to grasp the fact that the trade skill is different only in the<br/>
form of entertainment it supplies.  You still trade RL time for EQ money.<br/>
Either way it is just the same.<br/>
