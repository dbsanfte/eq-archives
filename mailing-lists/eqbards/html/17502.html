<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133844068">it sounds like we had almost the same machines.  i also had PII-333 and 2<br/>
voodoo2 cards in SLI mode.  it was a pos compaq but hey it was free.  i just<br/>
built my new system (1, for expansion and 2, cause my old system was damn<br/>
old) 3 days ago and i couldn&#39;t be happier.  i know computers but i don&#39;t<br/>
know the technology too well so i did some research, asked every friend i<br/>
have, and this is what i came up with:<br/>
<br/>
asus p3v4x (133 mhz bus, 4x agp, via 133a chipset)<br/>
pIII-550E (overclocked to 733mhz/133mhz bus)<br/>
192MB PC133 ram<br/>
maxtor 7200rpm ultra66 hdd<br/>
sb-live value<br/>
guillemot 3d prophet ddr-dvi<br/>
<br/>
i couldn&#39;t be happier.  incredible improvement.  i can&#39;t do anything to lag<br/>
myself.  i&#39;ve read all the messages on this subject, and i&#39;m sure there is<br/>
new and better stuff around the corner (isn&#39;t there always ugh).  all i can<br/>
relay is how happy i am.  and yes 30 person dragon raid, high particle<br/>
density, zero slow-down and 3 song twisting.  it shows me how much better it<br/>
is.  used to be 1 song for sure, 2 songs if i was lucky, all names and<br/>
particle density turned off.  and i can walk around north freeport on a<br/>
saturday night and not crawl.  as far as the sb-live, the only problem i had<br/>
was what i heard others were all reporting.  no lock-ups with the latest<br/>
drivers, but had to set hardware acceleration to standard (1 notch from<br/>
full) in the multimedia control panel to get things to sound right (e.g.<br/>
LOUD footsteps of cyclops, but can barely hear him getting hit or hearing<br/>
myself jump up in water loud, but barely hearing the splash).  as far as the<br/>
3d prophet ddr, obviously much better performance, as well as a lot richer<br/>
colors and sharper detail.  everything looks fantastic.  i just love playing<br/>
on my new machine, can&#39;t wait til the 24th.<br/>
<br/>
i sold my old system on ebay, but i kept my account =)<br/>
