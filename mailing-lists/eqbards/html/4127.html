<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-299082882"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; number of twinks, mainly I believe due to a large number of <br/>
&gt; maxed players who now are experimentin with new classes. As<br/>
&gt; one of my guildmembers put it, be happy for them, they did<br/>
&gt; earn that stuff at some point and having down the nwbie trip<br/>
&gt; once why should we grudge them? Far worse IMHO are the <br/>
&gt; max&#39;ed chars that are sold to someone else!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I see nothing wrong with passing your hard earned equipment or<br/>
money from one of your characters to a new character you&#39;re creating. The<br/>
reason for this is that I personally (your opinions may vary) consider it a<br/>
career change. So what if a 35th level Bard wants to change careers and<br/>
become a Warrior. Changing careers is still the same person, of course<br/>
they&#39;re going to have the same equipment sitting around. It&#39;s the skills<br/>
that you lose (and rightfully so) going to a new class. But I&#39;m still<br/>
personally against higher level characters giving other lower level<br/>
characters items that they wouldn&#39;t normally be able to afford or earn.</div>
