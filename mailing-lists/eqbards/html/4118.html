<div id="ygrps-yiv-560217057"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players<br/>
&gt;because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our<br/>
&gt;behinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out<br/>
&gt;in part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford<br/>
&gt;buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that<br/>
&gt;until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces<br/>
&gt;(or complete sets) of plate armor.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of the worst case of twinking I&#39;ve seen yet.  The other <br/>
night while in East Karana, I was hunting for my next gorge hound victim, <br/>
when a gnome warrior ran up to me and asked me for help.<br/>
<br/>
He was almost dead and lost, so I grouped with him and took him to the <br/>
village by the Beholder zone to heal him.  Lo and behold when I actually <br/>
looked at him, I was shocked.  I am level 20, he was blue to me.  Yet he had <br/>
rubicite, a unicorn shield, other items I can&#39;t remember now, but are just <br/>
as rare.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, I would assume that the driver of the char had another higher <br/>
level char with which he&#39;d twinked the lower one.  This was clearly not the <br/>
case.  The guy didnt know where Qeynos was, he was lost in East Karana, and <br/>
had no idea that the stuff he was sporting with such innocence was so hard <br/>
to come by.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO someone totally ruined the game for this guy, and he will never even <br/>
know it.  Not only has the thrill of the loot been taken from him, among <br/>
other things,  but other players will make his life a hard one because he is <br/>
twinked.<br/>
