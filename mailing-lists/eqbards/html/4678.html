&gt;Although this formlua may be max damage at low levels when you get to the <br/>
&gt;20s or<br/>
&gt;higher you can throw it out the window, although as you pointed out str <br/>
&gt;does<br/>
&gt;play a part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Very often now by thulian blood claw hits for 14. It is a DMG 5 weapon. My<br/>
&gt;Dragoon Dirk (DMG 6 weapon) in my off-hand hits for 15 often, but never 16. <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;is regardless of whether I fight at my present modified strength of 99, or<br/>
&gt;whether it goes much higher with anthem. It may be an imparted strength <br/>
&gt;bonus,<br/>
&gt;as you will notice putting on a strength item increases your attack factor, <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;it may be as a result of issue. My damage did not go up when I hit 20th, <br/>
&gt;but it<br/>
&gt;did a bit later. I started noticing these higher damages in the middle of <br/>
&gt;L30.<br/>
&gt;So was it L30, or was it the 2 Jagged Bands I swapped for my former 2 +2 <br/>
&gt;str<br/>
&gt;rings? I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;ll try a high cgreen con without the rings or<br/>
&gt;something and let you know. The bottom line is that 2xDMG+1 does seem very<br/>
&gt;accurate at lower levels, but not higher.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am interested in seeing what kind of dmg Shada can get with various <br/>
weapons at 50th or any of our other high level bards.<br/>
With my claw I have hit up to 19pts, with shard or dirk (both 6 dmg weapons) <br/>
i have hit for up to 23 pts, with staff of writhing up to 33, and with <br/>
crystalline blade i think 37. I have had my STR as high as 150 from various <br/>
buffs and battle songs.<br/>
