<b>Subject:</b> Another use for Lament (was: RE: (Lament and other newbie question s)) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088191861">Here is another use for Lament.  The first time I was in Unrest me and some <br/>
buddies were there killing the lawn trash, but we kept getting jumped by <br/>
wandering ghouls (melee hevy party and only 2 magic weapons).  One time when <br/>
I spotted a ghoul headed our way I decided in desperation to lament it, and <br/>
it work! He just shuffed right into and out of our battle!  Made me feel <br/>
good to be a bard, haha.  Another good use is when your casters are medding <br/>
and a wandering cat/bear/gnoll/whatever wanders by on mana patrol.  Hit it <br/>
with a Lament and it will got annoy someone else.<br/>
