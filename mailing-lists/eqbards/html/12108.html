would devalue rangers.  Nary a word about devaluing bards.<br/>

&gt; &gt; More evidence that &quot;bard hate&quot; is alive and well - unfortunately it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game designers and not monsters:<br/>

&gt; &gt; [clipped off www.eqvault.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqvault.com">http://www.eqvault.com</a>&gt;  where Gordon<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Verant&#39;s internet P/R person) was answering questions about druid<br/>
&gt; tracking<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill being raised]<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well we definatly wouldn&#39;t want to increase the cap to a level above<br/>
&gt; bards,<br/>
&gt; &gt; as to do so would devalue the ranger. The bard cap, to be honest, is set<br/>
&gt; too<br/>
&gt; &gt; high, but we&#39;ll just live with that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am beginning to wonder if _anyone_ at Verant has played chars thru level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 50 - start to finish like regular players do?  From what perspective are<br/>
&gt; &gt; they getting these _endless_ visions of &quot;class balancing&quot; needs.  And ya,<br/>
&gt; ya<br/>
&gt; &gt; - I wonder if _any_ of them ever play a normal bard - I dare anyone of<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; to level a bard to 35.  Much less test that new or changed spell/song on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bats in North Qeynos/G&#39;Fay/West Freep.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; p.s. really looking forward to level 40 - woo hoo Picklocks!!! Already<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; my gnome fiend making me a set of Gnomish Lockpicks.  And when I get<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.... LOOKOUT Befallen HERE I COME!!!!  Woo hoo a level 40 skill in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 20 dungeon!!!  /auction BBC 10pp or best offer - gimme a tell if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; want a sword that lowers your stats!!<br/>
