<div id="ygrps-yiv-633484080">I posted this same question on the alt.games.everquest newsgroup and got the<br/>
following response.  My original post was technically correct but I just<br/>
didn&#39;t know it.  <br/>
<br/>
For skills that you can obtain at level 1, i.e weapon and trade skills, when<br/>
you put a practice point into it you get a starting skill level of 1.  This<br/>
explains why my Sense Heading skill started at 1.<br/>
<br/>
For skills that you obtain at a certain level, when you expend a practice<br/>
point you get a starting level in that skill equal to your character&#39;s<br/>
current level.  This explains why my String skill started at 8.  <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: Your characters INT and/or WIS score has no impact on how many<br/>
skill points you get when you expend a practice point.  If I want to get my<br/>
brewing skill up to 10 (currently zero), I will have to expend 10 practice<br/>
points.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who responded.<br/>

&gt; The skill that you buy is equal to the lvl that you can buy it.  Lets say<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; am at lvl 10 and I buy dodge, then my first skill point will bring me up<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; 10.<br/>

&gt; A general question about expending practice points:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I got to 8th level I expended one practice point to train in String.<br/>
&gt; The first time I sang a song that used a stringed instrument, my skill<br/>
&gt; raised one point to 9.  That indicates that expending the initial practice<br/>
&gt; point to get the String skill gave me a skill level of 8.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, when I first started my character I expended one<br/>
&gt; practice<br/>
&gt; point in Sense Heading.  The next time I went up a level in Sense Heading,<br/>
&gt; my skill level was only 2.  That indicated one practice point spent and<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; skill level gained.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, does expending a practice point give you a random amount of skill<br/>
&gt; levels<br/>
&gt; based on your INT and/or WIS score or does it only give you one skill<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; per practice point?  If the second case is true, how do you account for me<br/>
&gt; getting 8 skill points in String while only expending 1 practice point?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reason for asking:  I am about to embark on a secondary career as the<br/>
&gt; Kelethin brewmaster for E&#39;ci.  I haven&#39;t expended any practice points in<br/>
&gt; brewing yet.  I want to get my skill up to 10 before I start the learning<br/>
&gt; process.  Just need to know if I only need to put a couple of practice<br/>
&gt; points in it or will I need to expend 10 practice points.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
