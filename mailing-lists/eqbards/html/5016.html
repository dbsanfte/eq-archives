<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086477965">This is replying to the person who couldn&#39;t loot his wife&#39;s NO DROP item.  <br/>
If she had consent you, you can target her corpse and use /corpse to drag <br/>
her corpse to a safe location for her to loot.  I don&#39;t know if this is a <br/>
new feature of the /corpse command or just not too many people know about <br/>
it.  But it worked great when I tried it last week.</div>
