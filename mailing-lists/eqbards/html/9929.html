<div id="ygrps-yiv-355867430">Your Int is 75 - what is your Charisma?<br/>
<br/>
From posts I&#39;ve seen - Charisma is the overriding factor when it comes to<br/>
the charm line of things.<br/>

&gt;I need some assistance with Charm.  I&#39;ve had this song for several levels<br/>
&gt;now and just simply can&#39;t figure out the proper method of using it.  I see<br/>
&gt;messages from some of the talented bards on this list saying &quot;Yeah, two Hill<br/>
&gt;Giants, no biggie.  I just charmed them against one another and got both<br/>
&gt;kills.&quot;  I would be dead or zonign within 15 rounds if I tried this.  At<br/>
&gt;level 31 HGs are still red to me, so let&#39;s take the Choon and Froon brothers<br/>
&gt;as examples because they&#39;re blue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s how I think it should work (remember, my base INT is only 75):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Set up a hotkey panel with Selo&#39;s, Charm, &quot;/pet attack&quot;, &quot;/pet back off&quot;.<br/>
&gt;- Equip drum and fire up Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;- Sneak up to the bros and Charm one.<br/>
&gt;- Assuming Charm sticks, the other will probably immediately attack it due<br/>
&gt;to its inheriting my factions, but if not, click on the other brother and<br/>
&gt;hit &quot;/pet attack&quot; hotkey.<br/>
&gt;- Click on original charmee.<br/>
&gt;- Start Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;- Watch ensuing battle.<br/>
&gt;- When Charm breaks and brother runs toward me, hit Charm again.<br/>
&gt;- Assuming Charm sticks, the charmee *should* return to previous &quot;/pet<br/>
&gt;attack&quot; status.<br/>
&gt;- Repeat until one is dead.<br/>
&gt;- Once one is dead, the problem shifts to a kite or chain/fear issue to<br/>
&gt;finish survivor off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve tried this.  Hell I can&#39;t even make this work with Orc Centurians in<br/>
&gt;East Commonlands.  Either I totally misunderstand something or I&#39;m just not<br/>
&gt;coordinated to pull it off.<br/>
