<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948246673">Go directly to Kizzie Mintopp. Do not pass Fiddy Binnstock. Get a pumice<br/>
stone for 15-18pp (called an egg-shaped pumice - icon looks like light<br/>
stone) it has 3 charges of Pillage Enchantment (strips 5 icons per charge)<br/>
Carry in a main inv slot.  When you get rooted, target self and right click<br/>
fast on the stone to cast effect on yourself.  Not sure if it will remove<br/>
steal strength or not.  I have a steel golum wand but have not had to use it<br/>
as i try to keep my MR up real high with a sha buff and or purifying<br/>
rythmns.<br/>
<br/>
Rations... 2sp<br/>
Dragoon Dirk... 40pp<br/>
Ashenwood Short Spear... 100pp<br/>
<br/>
Egg-shaped Pumice... priceless!<br/>

&gt; GZ: I will check this one out.  It *should* cast cancel magic on<br/>
&gt; your entire<br/>
&gt; group - and did at one point of beta.  It is high on my list of things to<br/>
&gt; check out/get fixed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Holy cow!  This would have been more than just a little bit useful in<br/>
Befallen at level 22.  It would have saved me several nasty DoT deaths.  FIX<br/>
THIS ONE!  When I&#39;m hunting (err.. dying) in Kithicor now I&#39;d have it memmed<br/>
right beside Selo&#39;s.  This would allow me to at least be in motion when I<br/>
died.</div>
