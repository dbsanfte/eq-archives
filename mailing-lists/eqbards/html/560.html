&gt;Once a friendly fellow gave me 1pp to take him from the docks to Kelethin.<br/>
&gt;Another time I accompanied a Euridite and he gave me a binding in exchange.<br/>
&gt;And that was only for a few zones.  Such a service could be set up for<br/>
&gt;Kelethin easily!  Just return to the docks every 14-16 game hours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve escourted folks from Freeport to Qeynos before, and only last night<br/>
&gt;this foolish Lv5 mage wouldn&#39;t follow me through the commonlands properly<br/>
&gt;(he seemed to trust the roads more than my experience).  This irritated me,<br/>
&gt;of course, because he was wasting my time and taking an unnecessary risk.<br/>
&gt;He also disobeyed my instructions to -never- engage in any combat and was<br/>
&gt;killed in the Gorge.  There I was, tapping my foot and wielding a<br/>
&gt;drum--being wacked by three goblins, just waiting for him to run on ahead<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I could follow.  No.  First he stood and watched a while as I screamed,<br/>
&gt;&quot;GO!&quot; and &quot;Run!&quot;  He then decides to cast a few spells; I knew he was<br/>
&gt;doomed.   For this reason I would advise taking payments in advance<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(require<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;at least half) and not making any guarantees to anyone&#39;s safety,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stipulating<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you can only make such a guarantee if the client follows your instructions<br/>
&gt;EXACTLY!  Simply too difficult to save someone if they make it difficult<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you through sheer stupidity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First rule should be, we are travelling and not fighting!  Perhaps insist<br/>
&gt;everyone sheath their weapons even. Then explain that they will avoid<br/>
&gt;anything as long as they don&#39;t stop, not to fear anything because they are<br/>
&gt;faster than any creature on Norrath.  So many people stop and nervously<br/>
&gt;stare when they spot a Hill Giant.  They are safer if they just keep<br/>

&gt;&gt;Jyzan mentioned in an earlier post that during the beta, a few bards were<br/>
&gt;&gt;offering their services to travellers wishing to speedily travel from<br/>
&gt;&gt;Freeport to Qeynos.  They were charging 1-2 PPs per person.  That sounds<br/>
&gt;&gt;like a great alternative for making some cash other than the standard<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trade<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;skills and adventuring.  What does everyone else think?  Is this a viable<br/>
&gt;&gt;way to make money?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am fairly new to the game and have not ventured anywhere other than on<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;Faydark continent.  As a result, I am not certain of all the perils of<br/>
&gt;cross<br/>
&gt;&gt;country travel on other continents.  I am also unaware of how long it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>takes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;for another class (at standard movement rates) to travel from Point A to<br/>
&gt;&gt;Point B on the other continents.  Do you guys think that other players, in<br/>
&gt;&gt;order to maximize their adventuring potential by decreasing travel times,<br/>
&gt;&gt;would be willing to pay for this service?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;If we agree this is a viable service, I was thinking that we could use<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;forum as a place to agree on standard service rates from Point A to Point<br/>
 </span></blockquote>B<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;for each continent.  I will consolidate all the recommendations I receive<br/>
&gt;&gt;and publish a list that everyone can use if they wish to perform this<br/>
&gt;&gt;service.  Of course, like all other services, final prices would still be<br/>
&gt;&gt;negotiable and subject to the supply/demand laws.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, in order to make this work, bards will have to start advertising the<br/>
&gt;&gt;service to their fellow players.  Amazingly, I grouped with some guys the<br/>
&gt;&gt;other day, all 8-10th level, who had never travelled cross-country with a<br/>
&gt;&gt;bard before.  We started in Kelethin and went to the Mino caves in<br/>
&gt;&gt;Steamfont.  They were amazed at how fast we got there.  Everyone made a<br/>
&gt;&gt;comment they were glad to have me in the group.  They were even more<br/>
&gt;&gt;gracious when we had to start fleeing from some Mino slavers:-)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Let me know what you think, both positive or negative.<br/>
