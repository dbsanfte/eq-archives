<b>Subject:</b> Re: L 11 song and L21+ sites? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-795002862">I have found that the most usefull aspect of the level 11 song is its ability<br/>
to grant the singer quests.  Using this song I can attempt or recieve any good<br/>
aligned races/classes quest.  I have tried this in several cities and know that<br/>
it is the truth. I try and hail the person, talk a bit and they give a &quot;once<br/>
you are in better standing then we will talk&quot; message.  Sing the level 11 song<br/>
then repeat the last quest cue.  Voila! instant quest. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve checked a couple of decent sources, and they disagree on what the lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt;11 song is.  I think EQVault says it&#39;s one thing, but it&#39;s broken.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Could someone set me straight, please (and if you know where to find it,<br/>
&gt; &gt;that&#39;d be great, too :) )?<br/>

&gt; In Kelethin you can learn this fascinating song which entrances people to<br/>
&gt; such a degree that they will like you more. Though it<br/>
&gt; will occasionally allow a Bard greater discounts on items, it is more<br/>
&gt; useful in allowing one to communicate with hostile beings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Secondly, even though it&#39;ll probably be months before I get to lvl 21 (I<br/>
&gt; &gt;enjoy my cleric and mage too, but bard most of all), where can I find the<br/>
&gt; &gt;higher level songs?  Are there any high level bard web sites?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can find out a lot at the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>
