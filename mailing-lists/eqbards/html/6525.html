<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547692849">It doesn&#39;t bother me that components of really good quests are no drop, but<br/>
a no drop runner&#39;s pouch to get a few sp?  What&#39;s the point of that?<br/>
There&#39;s no advantage to giving it to some poor newbie so they can get a few<br/>
free coppers.  Oh, wait according to your former post about Chain and root<br/>
I&#39;m a newbie, DOH!  Been playing since April 1st and stil a newbie, sigh.<br/>

I think changing quest items to NO DROP is a step in the right direction.<br/>
Case in point is the Exotic Drinks/Glowing Stein quest.  When the quest was<br/>
finally fixed a couple months back, people were creating 1st level mule<br/>
characters to kill the koalindl fish at the Temple of Life in Qeynos.  This<br/>
allowed them to avoid the major faction hit with their main character.  The<br/>
mule character then gave the fish to the main character ( I admit I did this<br/>
but only because my faction got screwed earlier by trying to complete the<br/>
quest legitimately before it got fixed).  To complete the quest now, the<br/>
same person has to acquire all the quest components.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the best way Verant could handle this is to make quest components NO<br/>
TRADE and keep magic items NO DROP.  That way, you could put quest<br/>
components in the bank until you got them all and eliminates using mule<br/>
characters to collect the items.  This would also allow Verant to start<br/>
giving better rewards for quests because it ensures that the player<br/>
completes all the necessary steps and earn the reward.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another thing, although not specifically bard related except in that bards<br/>
&gt; probably do more quests than anyone else simply because they can, is the<br/>
&gt; constant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I went to the bank<br/>
&gt; last nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 containers from the<br/>
&gt; bank<br/>
&gt; because if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I would have to<br/>
&gt; carry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does Verant think the<br/>
&gt; solution to everything is to make an item no drop.  Bizzarely the Bozemite<br/>
&gt; Pestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the use for is now No<br/>
&gt; Drop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires considerable<br/>
&gt; faction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go figure.  Why should<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across Norrath to get the<br/>
&gt; other piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put it in the bank<br/>
&gt; while searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; weigh<br/>
&gt; 10 lbs.<br/>
