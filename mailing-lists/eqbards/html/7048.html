<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why do the melee classes keep wanting Bind? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917261753"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I consistently read all over the net how members of certain <br/>
&gt; melee classes are sick and tired of having to go on 4 or 5 <br/>
&gt; zone spanning runs to get back to their body. Who are these <br/>
&gt; folks kidding? The only zone that is 4 zones away from a bind <br/>
&gt; point is Nagafen&#39;s Lair. (Nag&#39;s Lair-&gt;Solusk <br/>
&gt; A-&gt;Lavastorm-&gt;Nektulos-&gt;Neriak Foreign Quarter.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nobody is trying to kid anyone. For example, Lower Guk is 6 zones away from<br/>
where most people get bound - East Freeport..<br/>
<br/>
Freeport<br/>
North Ro<br/>
Oasis<br/>
South Ro<br/>
Innothule Swamp<br/>
Upper Guk<br/>
Lower Guk<br/>
<br/>
Most people can&#39;t get bound in Grobb. Or how about Cazic? The closest city<br/>
to there is Oggok where again, most people can&#39;t get bound.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; good aligned characters don&#39;t realize they can be bound in <br/>
&gt; evil cities just like good cities? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start up a half elf Bard and try to get bound in Grobb. I dare you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is a two zone run THAT bad? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Compared to being able to be bound just outside a zone entrance? Yes.<br/>
Especially when the zones you have to cross happen to be dangerous in<br/>
themselves so that you risk the chance that you&#39;ll die while naked and<br/>
running to your corpse.</div>
