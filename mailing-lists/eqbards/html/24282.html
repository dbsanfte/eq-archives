<br/>
*General Changes*<br/>
<br/>
-- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200.<br/>
-- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal&#39;s Breatplate on others<br/>
once casted upon yourself.<br/>
-- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<br/>
-- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book<br/>
or alt+b.<br/>
-- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<br/>
-- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on<br/>
Antonica and two others on Kunark.  NPCs at these locations can fill you in<br/>
on the details.  Good hunting.<br/>
-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the &quot;Celestial<br/>
Healing&quot; effect has been increased to one minute.  We understand that this<br/>
severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing<br/>
alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch.  We did,<br/>
however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and<br/>
kept on the group tank.  When we&#39;ve decided on the new affect, it will be<br/>
applied to those items retroactively.<br/>
-- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill<br/>
values over 100.  Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<br/>
-- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other<br/>
players.  You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players<br/>
by typing /inspect.<br/>
-- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the<br/>
chat window.<br/>
-- Fixed &quot;Breath of the Sea&quot;. It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.<br/>
-- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.<br/>
This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists<br/>
and clean up your pet.<br/>
-- &quot;Voice Graft&quot; will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of your<br/>
pet.<br/>
-- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<br/>
-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125.  It was the<br/>
intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before<br/>
the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better.  With<br/>
the tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was<br/>
appropriate.<br/>
-- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.<br/>
<br/>
*NPC AI Adjustments*<br/>
<br/>
-- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt<br/>
creatures that are level 60 to 65.  Previously, players could only taunt<br/>
creatures below their level.<br/>
-- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount<br/>
of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies.  Prior to<br/>
this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this.  This is why NPCs<br/>
would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<br/>
-- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much &quot;temporary hate&quot; when a<br/>
player would sit down in front of them.<br/>
-- The maximum amount of &quot;hate&quot; that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal<br/>
to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br/>
-- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number<br/>
of hitpoints healed.  Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point<br/>
of hate.  Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.<br/>
<br/>
*Velious Music*<br/>
<br/>
Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music<br/>
for some Velious Zones.  Let us know what you think of the new compositions.<br/>
<br/>
*EQGems*<br/>
<br/>
A new &quot;mini-game&quot; has been added to the EverQuest client.  EQGems is our<br/>
first effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different activities<br/>
while playing EverQuest.  Based upon the success of EQGems, we may explore<br/>
opportunities for other mini-games in the future, even some that are<br/>
multiplayer in and of themselves.  Type /gems to play.<br/>
