<br/>
I got mine by playing my sub-52 rogue on NUMEROUS Vox raids. I might still <br/>
keep him at 52 just in case we go do vox/nag again. Also some people will <br/>
de-level and leave corpses to be ressed because they want to participate. <br/>
*shrug* i&#39;d rather bring a secondary.<br/>
<br/>
Grats on 53, you will love Twilight!<br/>

&gt;Grats Sartori!!!!! From a fellow Veeshan bard...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Heh, and I was excited to ding 53 and get Song of Twilight :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Was on a failed Vox raid this week and got so fed up with the munchkins <br/>
&gt;(the<br/>
&gt;really bad players seem to have made it to lvl 50 now) that I decided to go<br/>
&gt;and lvl to 53 so I would never deal with crap like that again...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course I immediatly get an invite to Fear (thus no xp) and spend the<br/>
&gt;nexty 8 hours clearing it.  We even got to kill the enraged? golem (the<br/>
&gt;thing that the broken golem spawns).  Got my tendril and an imbrued bracer<br/>
&gt;(from a cube).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But I managed to get enough time at Dog Capt on Saturday to hit 53 :) (sigh<br/>
&gt;I leave 52 with neither scale and without Selo&#39;s Drums)<br/>
