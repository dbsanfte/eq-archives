&gt; the water.  Then I beller some more and get a message &quot;a aviak hits a aviak<br/>

While riding the large boats or a canoe, everything will be<br/>
indifferent to you.  I once hopped on a canoe to flee a tidal<br/>
lord train, and the instant I got on, they walked away as if<br/>
I&#39;d zoned.  I&#39;ve never tried attacking from one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hah.  My friend and I were riding the same canoe.  I was<br/>
busily guiding us to our destination when he makes a comment<br/>
about us going in circles.  I check my external view and he&#39;s<br/>
not on my boat.  He checks his external view and I&#39;m not on<br/>
his boat.  I sail back trying to find him or figure out what<br/>
happened, since he said he couldn&#39;t take control of his boat.<br/>
I can&#39;t find him, so I gave up control of my boat in the hopes<br/>
that it would let him take control of his boat.  He did, and<br/>
my boat disappeared from underneath me, dumping me in the<br/>
water.  But everything looked strange.  It turned out I&#39;d been<br/>
teleported when I was dumped, so that I was now in the water<br/>
*under* land.  I swam a bit to &quot;shore&quot; and popped up onto the<br/>
land.<br/>
<br/>
We decided not to use a canoe to cross Lake Rathe.<br/>
