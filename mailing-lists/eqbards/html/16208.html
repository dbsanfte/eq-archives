<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306646692">I remember a while back some bards on this list helpfully described a room<br/>
in Sol A to which one could pull safely.  Our guild is planning an outing<br/>
there this weekend and I would appreciate some advice on strategies and<br/>
locations for hunting there.  We are going to try to take down the predator<br/>
as well, would that be within the capability of a full group of 22-29&#39;s?<br/>
(avg level 26).<br/>
<br/>
	thanks!<br/>
