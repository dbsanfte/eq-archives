<b>Subject:</b> re: Lullaby and good night go to.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910618625">I have seen a number of complaints here by those just making lvl 15 that<br/>
Lullaby is ineffective.  Well IMHO Lullaby is one of the absolute most<br/>
useful songs I have in my arsenal, ranked right up there with Consonant<br/>
Chain and Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would like to stress here - MOST BARD SONGS ARE NOT VERY<br/>
EFFECTIVE AT THE LEVEL YOU GET THEM! Give it a couple levels, get your<br/>
skills up in the requisite instrument - All of a sudden the songs are more<br/>
effective, being resisted less, you are missing fewer notes etc..<br/>
<br/>
I find the Lullaby particulary useful for train control. Last night in Cazic<br/>
Thule i was hunting with a barbarian warrior and a human cleric. He pulled<br/>
from the throne room and a spawn occured and we were fighting 2 gorillas and<br/>
a lizard. Well with Lullaby, the two gorillas slept like babies.  Now yeah<br/>
they woke up, but a couple rounds after the &quot;nod off&quot; message, they were<br/>
sleeping again and we all fought the lizard, moved to the next gorilla and<br/>
then killed the last one. Could I do this effectively at 15th level even to<br/>
greens - NO! However as I have grown, the effectiveness of this song has<br/>
grown with me.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing with Selo Consanant Chain.  When I first got this at 23 it<br/>
was resisted 80% of the time. That is down to about 25% of the time against<br/>
blues now, meaning that if I repeatedly sing this song i *can* stop a runner<br/>
before it goes and brings friends.  Be patient, experiment, practice. Make<br/>
your level, rinse and repeat &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Big disadvantage of Lullaby - cannot be juggled<br/>
Big advantage of Lullaby - GREAT TO INTERRUPT THOSE PESKY CASTERS!<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 copper.....<br/>
