 </span></blockquote>to me it usually seems that the only way you know if you&#39;ve disenchanted something<br/>
is if the damage shield goes away.  only problem with that is you don&#39;t know what<br/>
other buffs the mob has stacked on itself before the damage shield.  so i think what is<br/>
happening is that you are dispelling something every time, but maybe not the damage<br/>
shield, but since you get no message, you don&#39;t know that you are.  also note that if <br/>
your casters start dropping dots and snares on the mob before you hit the damage shield<br/>
you will essentially be dispelling those instead of the damage shield.</div>
