&gt;only problem with aria is it only removes one buff per pulse, and sometimes<br/>
&gt;it takes more than one pulse to remove a buff (unless they changed it).  i<br/>
&gt;like to use it in duels though :)  casters, however, have cancel magic<br/>
&gt;spells that remove 3 buffs in one cast, so if they are willing to use it it<br/>
&gt;is more effective.  however you do it though, it&#39;s very important to get rid<br/>
&gt;of damage shields and especially SoW on mobs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>to me it usually seems that the only way you know if you&#39;ve disenchanted something<br/>
is if the damage shield goes away.  only problem with that is you don&#39;t know what<br/>
other buffs the mob has stacked on itself before the damage shield.  so i think what is<br/>
happening is that you are dispelling something every time, but maybe not the damage<br/>
shield, but since you get no message, you don&#39;t know that you are.  also note that if <br/>
your casters start dropping dots and snares on the mob before you hit the damage shield<br/>
you will essentially be dispelling those instead of the damage shield.</div>
