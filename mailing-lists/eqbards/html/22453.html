<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029073988">BTW if you haven&#39;t read about it yet, DAoC will have bard classes for each<br/>
race.  Humans are minstrels, barbarians are skalds, and elves are bards. I<br/>
checked out the website but couldn&#39;t find any information on exactly how<br/>
bards in general will work or how they will differ between races.<br/>
Interested to find out though if someone is in the beta.<br/>

that.  It&#39;s good to hear that Mythic was on the ball, though. I may look <br/>
into that one after all.<br/>
