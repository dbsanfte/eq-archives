 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s pretty bad at your level (teens to low 20s).  It gets<br/>
better in the mid 20s to 30s.  It was almost completely gone<br/>
(for me) in my 30s, then started coming back in the 40s.  I<br/>
suspect that&#39;s because by level 40 all the tanks have capped<br/>
their taunt and combat skills, whereas our songs keep getting<br/>
better.<br/>
