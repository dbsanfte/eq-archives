&gt; 26 -- Angstlich&#39;s Appalling Screech.  In the wrong<br/>
place at the wrong<br/>
&gt;       time, this can be a disaster.  However, I have<br/>
used it<br/>
&gt;       effectively a few times as a panic button,<br/>
giving my party (or<br/>
&gt;       what remained of it) time to zone.  I guess it<br/>
could also be<br/>
&gt;       used for reverse-kiting in safer areas, but<br/>
I&#39;ve never tried<br/>
&gt;       that.  Because of its limited usefulness, I<br/>
rarely have it<br/>
&gt;       memorized, unless I strongly suspect a pending<br/>
disaster.<br/>
<br/>
    I vastly underestimated this song, and relegated<br/>
it to<br/>
    practicing brass skill.  Then while we were in the<br/>
depths of<br/>
    Guk, I happened to have it memorized when we got<br/>
in over our<br/>
    heads. My friends all ran out of the song&#39;s range<br/>
and died<br/>
    within 30 seconds.  I made it from the Lord room<br/>
to the zone<br/>
    (a 1-2 minute run) losing only 2 bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
    Later, after I recovered their corpses and they&#39;d<br/>
been<br/>
    resurrected and were sitting out the resurrection<br/>
effects at<br/>
    the zone, someone dumped a train on us.  So I<br/>
fired up Screech<br/>
    again, and I&#39;ll be damned it worked.  The cleric<br/>
had to heal<br/>
    me once in the 2+ minutes we sat there waiting for<br/>
the others<br/>
    to finish looting and regain enough strength to<br/>
move, but we<br/>
    went from a really bad situation to a yawner with<br/>
the cleric<br/>
    &quot;practicing&quot; some little-used spells on the<br/>
fleeing frogs to<br/>
    kill time.<br/>
<br/>
    I think we will change our dungeon retreat<br/>
strategy to me<br/>
    firing up this song, and everyone sticking close<br/>
to me as we<br/>
    *slowly* make our way to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
I was ecstatic about this song as I thought it would<br/>
keep me alive!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Do you need to stop and restart this song repeatedly<br/>
or are you leaving it on?  I twice failed in my<br/>
attempts to use this for myself running out in Guk:<br/>
once the Shin Lord room (tal shaman on me) and once<br/>
the prison (warden on me), although I came very very<br/>
close the second time.  Is it best to stand still<br/>
during the first screech to evaluate the<br/>
effectiveness?  Or just high-tail it whilst jamming<br/>
the screech button?<br/>
<br/>
[As an aside, I was using Clouding (invis) both times<br/>
when I was attacked.  Is it that one or both of those<br/>
in particular have see invis or was I unlucky?  I have<br/>
run down to check Shin Lord spot a few times without<br/>
being jumped before but perhaps I stepped into room a<br/>
bit too far?  Went too close to warden?  It has also<br/>
failed repeatedly in Cazic in the maze where I know<br/>
the lizards don&#39;t have see invis.  Ouch.]<br/>
<br/>
John, have you tried screech in Cazic with the higher<br/>
level lizards?  I have used on the lower level ones<br/>
successfully.<br/>
<br/>
More general: please share more get-out-of death<br/>
strategies.  I die a lot (ouch, hehe) as I&#39;m sure many<br/>
bards do because of the taunt effect of many of our<br/>
songs, especially in indoor dungeons.  Screech is one<br/>
strategy.  Would pixie striking help?  Lullaby?<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
     It&#39;s also good for Chain/Fear attacks (snare/Fear<br/>
is probably<br/>
     better as then there&#39;s less chance of the Fear<br/>
effect wearing<br/>
     off due to resists).  This will significant cut<br/>
down the<br/>
     damage you take when fighting ultra-powerful<br/>
melee mobs<br/>
     (griffins, giants, cyclopses, etc).<br/>
-------------<br/>
Chain/fear makes soloing a much more enjoyable<br/>
experience.  Not only can you follow behind something<br/>
hitting, bellowing, and DoTing it from behind, you can<br/>
sometimes scare off that extra one you really didn&#39;t<br/>
want while keeping the one you did chained.<br/>
<br/>
============================================================================<br/>
&gt; 28 -- Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike.  If this cleared the<br/>
mob&#39;s shit-list,<br/>
&gt;       it would be fantastic.  As it is, I find it<br/>
disappointing.  It<br/>
&gt;       is certainly no substitute for the enchanter&#39;s<br/>
mesmerize.  If I<br/>
&gt;       can really charm multiple mobs at once, then I<br/>
see no real<br/>
&gt;       advantage to mesmerizing, but if charm is<br/>
limited to one at a<br/>
&gt;       time, then I guess mesmerize could be useful<br/>
as an alternative<br/>
&gt;       to lullaby.  Still, it seems that when<br/>
mesmerizing two or three<br/>
&gt;       mobs, I&#39;d have to pull out of the fighting<br/>
completely, whereas<br/>
&gt;       with lullaby I can still be in there bashing<br/>
on the same guy<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;       party is attacking.  Not currently memorized,<br/>
but maybe I need<br/>
&gt;       to experiment with this more.<br/>
<br/>
    My experience has been that mobs break out of<br/>
Lullaby more<br/>
    often and more quickly than with Strike.  Also, I<br/>
dunno what<br/>
    weapons you use or who you usually group with, but<br/>
each of the<br/>
    folks I&#39;m grouped with typically do twice as much<br/>
damage as me<br/>
    in a fight, and there are usually two or three of<br/>
them.  So<br/>
    it&#39;s not a problem for me to drop out of a fight<br/>
and stick to<br/>
    just my instruments while striking two or three<br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
    Another thing it does is interrupt casters, which<br/>
is great in<br/>
    certain areas since it&#39;s not area effect like<br/>
Lullaby.  If<br/>
    we&#39;re fighting something like a lizard herald or<br/>
justicar, I<br/>
    will just strike it over and over instead of<br/>
singing any other<br/>
    songs.  Between me and the paladins casting stun,<br/>
solo casting<br/>
    mobs usually get off 0-1 spells during a fight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
Very effective for interrupting casters!  I saw that<br/>
suggestion here and have been using it in Cazic ever<br/>
since.  Thanks, guys.  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 29 -- Psalm of Vitality.  Um.  Okay, great disease<br/>
resistance.  (No<br/>
&gt;       poison resistance at all, despite what I&#39;ve<br/>
seen on some of the<br/>
&gt;       song listings.)  Big whoop.  Am I going to be<br/>
fighting anything<br/>
&gt;       where people are going to care about this? <br/>
The last time I<br/>
&gt;       fought anything with disease, it was the<br/>
undead gnolls in Lake<br/>
<br/>
It has a pretty nice AC bonus (same as Chant of Battle<br/>
with a<br/>
drum), but then so does Psalm of Warmth, and that has<br/>
a damage<br/>
shield to boot, so yeah, pretty useless.  Maybe if<br/>
diseases<br/>
really meant something, like they added lycanthropy,<br/>
then this<br/>
song would be useful.<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
Psalm of Warmth has an AC bonus?  I will have to check<br/>
that out.  I like Psalm of Warmth as well when I am<br/>
the lowest level person in the group.  Many of the<br/>
offensive songs are repeatedly resisted so I<br/>
concentrate on the defensive or non-combat ones:<br/>
warmth, anthem, and heal.<br/>
<br/>
Also regarding Psalm of Warmth, I see the &#39;xxx was<br/>
burned&#39; message much more often than the &#39;xxxx was hit<br/>
by non-melee damage for 5 points&#39; (insert exact<br/>
wording).  What is your experience on the relative<br/>
frequencies?  Are the burned messages alone only an<br/>
indication that it is up and working and the damage is<br/>
only done when the non-melee message appears?<br/>
<br/>
============================================================================<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d appreciate any observations that run counter to<br/>
my own analysis,<br/>
&gt; plus some insight on what&#39;s coming up for me in the<br/>
30&#39;s.  Do any of<br/>
&gt; these new songs really rock?<br/>
<br/>
    Clarity (L32) is probably the most anti-climactic<br/>
song you<br/>
    will ever get.  Everyone wants it, you can&#39;t wait<br/>
for it, and<br/>
    when you finally do get it... nothing.  You cannot<br/>
see<br/>
    *anything* this song does because it does not<br/>
affect you in<br/>
    the slightest (except the annoying spam messages).<br/>
 All you<br/>
    get are reassurances from anyone who&#39;s not a bard,<br/>
monk,<br/>
    warrior, or rogue, that yes, their mana is indeed<br/>
regenerating<br/>
    faster.  More like a whimper than a bang.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
I am sure I will need to carry a towel to deal with<br/>
all the drooling when I reach 32.  I am currently<br/>
carrying a stick to poke those who say &quot;Oh, you&#39;re not<br/>
a mana bard?  =(&quot;.<br/>
