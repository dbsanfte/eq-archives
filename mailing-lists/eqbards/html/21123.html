<div id="ygrps-yiv-555154468">just for your info, a necro has way less downtime kiting then a druid would.<br/>
Lich is just a tad slower then clarity 2, and with pet well... stuff doesnt<br/>
last long. With my necro im about 80 mana after a fight where rest of the<br/>
group is 40-50, and its not cause im stingy on the spells either. Only takes<br/>
20 mana to kill a raptor, which is a very short med period. Im not gonna<br/>
compare the who&#39;s best issue cause well i&#39;ve always had lousy luck kiting<br/>
with my bard, but i know it can be done no prob since my friend used to do<br/>
it hours on end. I&#39;m not dissing the druids either since i know one that<br/>
takes out 4 raptors at a time. *shrug*<br/>

What&#39;s the best kiting class in the game?  Druids?  Early on maybe.  Necros?<br/>
Only if ye like to med.  The answer, dear folks, is Bards.<br/>
<br/>
    So I got bored while waiting on some friends to come over, right?  So I<br/>
fired up EQ (I had camped out in my usualy dog-hunting spot next to the FV<br/>
giant camp), and decided to try a different twist to my kiting.  Instead of<br/>
using Chains/Chant/Chant, why not use Selo&#39;s/Chant/Chant?  (The Chants being<br/>
Fufil&#39;s and Tuyen&#39;s DoTs)  Before long, I had amassed a most impressive<br/>
tally of 10 growlers, 1 snarler, and one froglock ton night who came outta<br/>
nowhere, and had not lost even a bubble of hps!<br/>
     Emboldened by this turn of events, later in the evening (my friends had<br/>
come by, and I had spent the afternoon chasing women with them) I was heard<br/>
to wonder on guild chat &quot;hmmm...  I wonder if I can kite all 3 giants at<br/>
once?&quot;<br/>
    Pulling only 2 (somehow), I began my craft.  What I found most amusing<br/>
is that folks passing by would stop to watch in amazement.  There I was, a<br/>
lone blue-clad, green-boot-wearin&#39; bard running in big circles with 2 giants<br/>
and an ever-increasing horde of drolvargs (mostly growlers) not far behind.<br/>
Every now and then, one of the critters would fall over dead.  Thinking back<br/>
on it, I have to wonder how many times I was /petitioned for exploiting<br/>
something   heh!<br/>
     Mebbe one of these days I&#39;ll get the hang of Charm-kiting, but until<br/>
then... let the Druids and Necros stand in awe of the Kite-ability of the<br/>
Bardic class ;o)<br/>
(I even got the druid to say &quot;Bards ROCK!!&quot; on guildchat after he saw me<br/>
wittle down the long line of beasties)<br/>
