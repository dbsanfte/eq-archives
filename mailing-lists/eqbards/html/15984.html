<div id="ygrps-yiv-370010267"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Back in those wonderful, naive days of the first couple months after the<br/>
&gt;game was released; when there was hope that the game would rise above the<br/>
&gt;k3WLd00dz of that other game - I&#39;d /petition every time I saw an<br/>
&gt;&quot;inappropriate&quot; name.  I&#39;m pretty sure I got a &quot;Cornholio&quot; changed...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Man people really cared about it too, including me. I remember when the<br/>
first goofy name showed up in Greater Faydark on Povar, a monk named<br/>
something silly, when she asked if anyone could help her find her corpse I<br/>
immediately got 4 or 5 tells asking me not to help her. People were serious.<br/>
Easily the best thing about being a UO Counselor (being out of the<br/>
&quot;sex-for-castles&quot; loop :o) was when you saw an offensive name you could make<br/>
your case on #uo-council and if others thought it was offensive too...*poof*<br/>
one more &quot;Generic Player&quot; running around, which, although it didn&#39;t aid RP<br/>
much, I always thought it was fair punishment.<br/>
Asking everyone to play the same way on such a large scale just will never<br/>
work, and frankly the OOC comraderie that I have seen the last few days in<br/>
East Karana is every bit as valid in it&#39;s own way as RP&#39;d social interaction<br/>
(&quot;Marco!&quot;... &quot;Polo!&quot; &quot;POLO!&quot;&quot;polo!&quot; :o) but I do think it is a good ideal,<br/>
and one to keep trying for.<br/>
