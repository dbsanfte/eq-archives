<div id="ygrps-yiv-8223571">Well 250pp for a PGT is great in my opinion I remember when those things<br/>
sold for 500pp. Newbies have a lot better weapons now a days and you have to<br/>
remember they can&#39;t b alance everthing. It&#39;s impossible to know what each<br/>
server is going to turn out like. I know on are server E&#39;ci jewelry is<br/>
actual;ly extremly cheap compared to other servers. Each server has a<br/>
diffrent market and so forth. You have to remember also that bards are not<br/>
meat grinders they are not great at dishing damage in melee. Best I can tell<br/>
you is to camp for the PGT for now can&#39;t quite remember all the weapons.<br/>
Although if you want you can also get a Black Enammeld Mace pretty cheap.<br/>

&gt;Brian&#39;s post is interesting, but I&#39;m not sure it is all that accurate.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps this is accurately what Verant wants to be true, but it is not what<br/>
&gt;is true.  Monks out damage warriors only until the warrior gains some good<br/>
&gt;weapons around 15th level or so.  After that the warrior often out damages<br/>
&gt;the monk, but the monk takes less damage.  The reason for this?  The monk<br/>
&gt;having no offensive items to spend money on is free to spend all his funds<br/>
&gt;to acquire better defensive items.  The two do seem to balance out with the<br/>
&gt;warrior doing more damage but the monk taking less.  Despite not being able<br/>
&gt;to wear heavy armor our group monk who is 2 levels lower than me has nearly<br/>
&gt;the same ac I do, and I have only one piece of armor with an AC below<br/>
 </span></blockquote>banded<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and several at plate or higher.  He takes way less damage than I do and<br/>
&gt;until he is 35th level will probably never die again except in very rare<br/>
&gt;circumstances.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My biggest laugh was at Brian&#39;s mention of Bard only items.  That&#39;s a good<br/>
&gt;one.  Excepting the quest armor, there are what, two bard only items that<br/>
&gt;you can get without taking on a dragon or going to the planes?  A Shawl of<br/>
&gt;the Wind Spirit and Mistmoore Battle Drums, that&#39;s it as far as I know.  A<br/>
&gt;piece of armor equal to cloth and a drum on a 35+ mob.  To even mention<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bard<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;only items was in my opinion a slap in the face.  Considering one is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>useless<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;after 3rd level and the other sells for 500pp+ that&#39;s a joke.  What other<br/>
&gt;class has so little equipment dedicated to it?  There must be one but I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know what it would be.  Are there even any other items on mobs below<br/>
&gt;30th that are bard plus a few others?  Shimmering Orb, great for looks but<br/>
&gt;with dual wield is it useful?  Anyone know of anything else?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>why<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th level?<br/>
&gt;There really isn&#39;t anything much better than my dragoon dirk and screaming<br/>
&gt;mace available for bards at my level.  The only 1HS weapons available are a<br/>
&gt;Polished Granite Tomahawk and a Barbed Leather Whip.  They don&#39;t even begin<br/>
&gt;to compare to our Shadowknight&#39;s Dark Reaver.  The primary weapons carried<br/>
&gt;by every member of our group is better than either the PGT or the BLW.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That&#39;s a good question.  Since we don&#39;t have anybody near my level who is a<br/>
&gt;melee class (or hybrid other than the SK) its really puzzling.  Our mages<br/>
&gt;carry Glowing Wooden Crooks or better, at 150pp not hard to see why.  The<br/>
&gt;shadowknight has a dark Reaver and I&#39;m using the same primary as the 7th<br/>
&gt;level ranger, a dragoon dirk.  At 25pp who would blame him?  A good 1HS<br/>
&gt;weapon on the other hand cost 400pp+.<br/>
&gt;Why does this inequity exist?  Because in truth their are far more good<br/>
&gt;piercing weapons per piercing user than 1HS per 1HS user.  All the good 1HS<br/>
&gt;weapons at the mid-levels are either warrior or paladin or ranger only.  I<br/>
&gt;could currently get thru quests at least 6 weapons I cannot use.  The<br/>
 </span></blockquote>quests<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;are easily doable for a group of my level or close (21st).  I can get no<br/>
&gt;decent weapons via quest that I can use except the Screaming Mace that I<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;9 levels ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Believe me if anyone can refute this and offer me a solution to where I<br/>
&gt;might find a better weapon obtainable I&#39;d be glad to hear it.  I get really<br/>
&gt;tired of having my own guild members laugh, &quot;you still using that little<br/>
&gt;sticker?&quot;  I suppose I could buy a PGT, but at the 250pp they go for on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>E&#39;ci<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it hardly seems justifiable.  Any suggestions out there?  I currently own 4<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; CONCLUSION<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hopefully this gives you some insight into how tricky designing some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>items<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; can be. It&#39;s both an art and a science -- you have to have an intuitive<br/>
&gt;feel<br/>
&gt;&gt; for the interactions between everything (race, procs, stat bonuses,<br/>
&gt;classes,<br/>
&gt;&gt; skill caps, etc.) and then you have to back up your gut instincts by<br/>
&gt;running<br/>
&gt;&gt; simulations so that the numbers do, in fact, add up to what you expect.<br/>
&gt;Then<br/>
&gt;&gt; you have to see how it all fits into the world with regards to real world<br/>
&gt;&gt; usefulness (is that proc really relevant? Do these races really use this?<br/>
&gt;Is<br/>
&gt;&gt; there another weapon that&#39;s similar and easier to get?) and hope you made<br/>
&gt;&gt; the right decision.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  This guy is like a god.  When I read his stuff, I get more<br/>
&gt;  insight, more information, and more chuckles than anything<br/>
&gt;  else Verant releases.  I especially enjoyed reading his story<br/>
&gt;  about the GM event he ran a long time ago.  I wish there were<br/>
&gt;  more of him running around at Verant.  The game would<br/>
&gt;  probably be a lot more interesting.<br/>
