<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652109956">While I agree with this, I also would like to point out something.. you<br/>
often don&#39;t WANT to be doing &quot;maxium damage&quot; in a group.  Sure we wear plate<br/>
and have decent AC but in a balanced group, warriors and SK need to be<br/>
absorbing the damage.  If you are blaring away on your chants, doing enough<br/>
damage that you are overcoming the warrior&#39;s taunt button, thats not<br/>
healthy.  I think a lot of bards fall into this trap.. its like the rangers<br/>
who choose high-procing weapons and dex over AC, and wonder why they die all<br/>
the time and why their cleric hates them.  Wait til the fight is well under<br/>
way, and the aggro firmly fixed on the tank before bringing out the high<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, maybe I&#39;m wrong :)<br/>

&gt; Bards make magic with music.  They can make music with song and their<br/>
&gt; instruments can make (some) songs better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Look at the songs and if they are string, percussion, wind or <br/>
&gt; brass, they<br/>
&gt; will be enhanced (have more power) when you sing them and have the<br/>
&gt; appropriate instrument equipped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some instruments give more power than others (in the same class: wind,<br/>
&gt; string, etc.)  The instruments bought in stores (from <br/>
&gt; merchants) are the<br/>
&gt; base line.  See this for a chart of the instruments:  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bards at your level can learn the &quot;all instrument attack&quot; -- <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s actually a<br/>
&gt; cantana-tada-tina(tm) ;)  You can play a series of songs and <br/>
&gt; do more damage<br/>
&gt; to mobs than if you were to use your weapons.  You can learn to swap<br/>
&gt; instruments for maximum effect.  For example:  play Chords of <br/>
&gt; Dissonace with<br/>
&gt; lute; Heal song with lute; swap lute for brass horn and play Denon&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Dischord. Rinse, repeat.  Setting up a hot key pallette with <br/>
&gt; your melee 2<br/>
&gt; slot and 2 inventory slots helps with the swapping.  And once you get<br/>
&gt; comfortable, you can just leave the swapped out instrument on <br/>
&gt; your mouse<br/>
&gt; cursor.  Here is a link to a more complete explanation:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Learnin to use Area Effect songs early in your career is a <br/>
&gt; big plus.  I was<br/>
&gt; scared from too many times singing chords to Corporal Lancot and just<br/>
&gt; avoided these good songs for way too long.  Yes, <br/>

&gt; Interesting - I never have used my instruments during a <br/>
&gt; fight. I&#39;m currently<br/>
&gt; level 21 - actually now that I think about it, I&#39;m level 20, I died<br/>
&gt; yesterday :(. Is just using my weapons in battle normal for <br/>
&gt; my level? Should<br/>
&gt; I expect to be using my instruments a lot more often when I <br/>
&gt; hit a certain<br/>
&gt; level?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I noticed that Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord uses Brass instruments and I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t used the song yet. Is it a useful song? I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; really like to sing<br/>
&gt; AE songs in battle since it causes problems right quick - <br/>
&gt; although I do like<br/>
&gt; Largos as it has a pretty small radius. Are all of our good <br/>
&gt; songs going to<br/>
&gt; be AE? Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord would be awesome if I could sing it<br/>
&gt; without fear that I&#39;m going to pull everything in the zone...<br/>
