<div id="ygrps-yiv-24973729">I have solo&#39;ed an enchanter in the 20s, and a guildmate was fussing that he<br/>
had to solo most of his early 40s (the rush to planar level) and another<br/>
ex-guildmate (she&#39;s retired and guild defunct) soloed about half the time<br/>
thru her 30s and 40s as well.  They don&#39;t solo like a Bard .. but they can<br/>
solo if they get *just* the right mobs in the right places.   And<br/>
charm-kiting is not reliable .. but pet-fear kiting isn&#39;t too bad.  So in<br/>
some of the wide-open zones with a mob that doesn&#39;t attract notice from its<br/>
kin when it runs about screaming (so it comes back alone) is quite feasible<br/>
during off-times.  Chanter fear is nicer .. and when the mob un-fears ..<br/>
hopefully it just turns around and hits the pet not you :) .  J- boots/SoW<br/>
nice .. but not needed if you can stay close enough to hit a guard after you<br/>
stun an unruly mob (assume your pet will be sacrificing itself too).  I<br/>
found that the pet, the stun line and the nice reliability of the chanter<br/>
spells (when compared to my bard songs) equalled out Bard skills when solo.<br/>
And if you can get sow (clarity for sow usually works *very* well when solo)<br/>
you then just carefully pick naturaly slow moving mobs then charm kiting<br/>
becomes a decent choice again.   What was nice was to solo next to a druid<br/>
who was soloing ... you could bail each-other out as needed, and trade<br/>
clarity/breeze for sow ....<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I looked at class numbers off-peak - I&#39;d see 4 classes:<br/>
necros - soloing<br/>
druids - soloing .. some grouped<br/>
clerics & chanters - a few level-chasers solo, but most grouped since they<br/>
can get groups in any of the &quot;popular&#39; zones (which conversely get too busy<br/>
for good exp in peak hours<br/>
<br/>
- Menuette(Bard) on Luclin, ret. Hechicera (chanter) on Rodcet Nife<br/>

&gt; Awesome!  I didn&#39;t know about that option.  I&#39;ll start recording stats<br/>
&gt; during prime-time and see what shakes out.  I was concerned that off-peak<br/>
&gt; hours might skew numbers towards more soloable classes, until I saw how<br/>
many<br/>
&gt; enchanters there were :-o<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never met anyone who could solo an enchanter after 20th level.<br/>

&gt; Kit - you forgot you can do a &quot;/who warrior all count&quot; and get just the<br/>
&gt; count - without worrying about the list cutoff.  You can do this during<br/>
&gt; primetime and get better statistics.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;         With over 600 people on the server this means that either half the<br/>
&gt; server was      Anonymous or Roleplaying (Highly unlikely) or those<br/>
classes<br/>
&gt; which were too many     to list were actually much, much higher than 32 in<br/>
&gt; number.<br/>
