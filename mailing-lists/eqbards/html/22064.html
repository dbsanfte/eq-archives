<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841645135">Aye, it was very fluffy and I don&#39;t consider it really an article but more <br/>
of a rambling. Why in the world would anyone even consider this an <br/>
&quot;editorial&quot;? More of a journal entry of &quot;My day in Norrath&quot;. :-P<br/>

&gt;actually being a problem for bards to be a bit annoying.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well that&#39;s not entirely fair. He states that his own test is inconclusive:<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, what have I to conclude from my testing?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not a thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; His quote about being a happy bard is simply stating that he enjoyed a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard&#39;s versatility and usefulness. He never really bring&#39;s up John Kim&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; statistics that I see. He does talk about some &quot;debate about Bards and<br/>
&gt; &gt; their Lullaby&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just based on this one article, he doesn&#39;t really sound like a very <br/>
&gt; serious<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Worse than that, for the whole playerbase, IMO, was his willingness to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;completely throw out the detailed study John Kim had posted (article<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;comments indicate that was the thread he had been reading) and instead<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;rely on his very brief experience with the song before he got distracted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;helping a player find his corpse. Then he announces he&#39;s perfectly happy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;with the song, as if that negates anyone else&#39;s concerns. This seems<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;little different than Abashi&#39;s attitude.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doh, i was hoping he was at least a few levels higher *sigh*<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm. Check out his other article here. A little less encouraging, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say.<br/>
