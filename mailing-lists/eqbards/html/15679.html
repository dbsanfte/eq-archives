<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909502479">When my group fights runner who tend to resist root (the gobs in<br/>
permafrost are really good at resisiting it, over 50% for blue mobs), I<br/>
(the cleric) will stun, while the wizard hits it with the root.  Its a<br/>
pretty bad waste of mana, but since mobs near the zone (where a group of<br/>
lvl 18&#39;s can fight) all teleoprt when they hit a certain spot, its<br/>
necessary.    The mana waste doesnt seem to  bad since enchanters<br/>
hanging around the zone give us clarity sometimes.  (Clarity on a lvl 18<br/>
char is pretty amazing).  Our groups biggest problem is no snare (we are<br/>
warrior/bard/cleric/wizard), but chains aren;&#39;t too far away for the<br/>
bard.  (We also have a friend training up a necro who will give us the<br/>
darkness spells)<br/>
