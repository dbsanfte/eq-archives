<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884521809">Hi all,<br/>
Well its time for me to call upon the experinced souls here to get some advice<br/>
regarding weapons. I have the following weapons at my disposal:<br/>
- Ebon Razor (Primary only) Damage 9, Delay 25, +4 fire, cold & magic prot.  Wt.<br/>
3.5.<br/>
- Short Sword of the Ykesha:  Damage 8, Delay 24, Weight 4.5.  Effect of Ykesha<br/>
(75 point direct damage spell)<br/>
- Staff of Writhing 9/33 Diret proc Damage 48<br/>
- Bladed thullian claws (Primary only). 5/19<br/>
- Silvery War Axe  6/22<br/>
Currently Im wielding the Ebon Razor and the yak and I think my damage is better<br/>
than with the yak in primary and Silvery in off hand. But I have my doubts. Im<br/>
not satisfied with the yak being placed in my offhand. Do any of you have<br/>
suggestions for a better weapon setup?<br/>
I have been thinking of getting a second yak, but I find the proc is resisted<br/>
quite a lot by kunark mobs atleast.<br/>
<br/>
