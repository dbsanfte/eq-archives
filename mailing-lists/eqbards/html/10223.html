<div id="ygrps-yiv-465406571">I have a suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
Have the singing skill also affect the range of your songs.  The higher your<br/>
skill, the greater the range.  This would help greatly with the healing<br/>
song, which to me at level 16, seems to have quite a small radius.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mean being able to sing across a zone, but have some sort of effect.  The<br/>
better you are at singing, the better able you are to project your voice.<br/>
<br/>
Give us the block skill (I don&#39;t recall seeing it).  I think ANY class able<br/>
to wield a shield should be able to get this skill.  (As an aside, have a<br/>
shield increase your ability to block!  Having a 3&#39; x 2&#39; metal-shod shield<br/>
is going to let you block a hell of a lot easier than with your arm. :))  I<br/>
don&#39;t think it would be so unbalancing to give a melee class this skill.<br/>
<br/>
Also give us parry.  Again, I don&#39;t think it would be unbalancing.  We are,<br/>
after all, more melee than not.<br/>
<br/>
As for song ideas.. an invis to undead song?  or, at a certain level, give<br/>
our current invis song the ability to hide us from undead as well.  Unless<br/>
it does already, I dont&#39; know. :)<br/>
<br/>
Hm.  That&#39;s all I can think of right now, as it&#39;s 1:30am and I really need<br/>
sleep.<br/>

&gt; Kitasi raises some good points IMO.  Although I always enjoy this type of<br/>
&gt; discussion, I think we will have to wait until the expansion comes out<br/>
&gt; before we will know what Verant has in store for the bards and other<br/>
&gt; classes.  Its too bad that Verant is tight lipped when it comes to<br/>
&gt; discussion of class mechanics.  In addition to new songs, I am hoping that<br/>
&gt; we will get new skills like parry and riposte (with caps high enough to be<br/>
&gt; useful) at some point after 50th level.  If the only thing we get are<br/>

&gt; disappointed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know how useful it would be, but maybe the bard community (mailing<br/>
&gt; list and Concert Hall board) should bang heads together and come up with a<br/>
&gt; list of song ideas and skills that we would like to see get added with the<br/>
&gt; expansion.  The way I interpreted GZ&#39;s response to our questions, Verant<br/>
&gt; seems to be having a hard time coming up with new song ideas.  Maybe we<br/>
&gt; could help them out some.  I volunteer John Kim, Shada and Rokenn to take<br/>
&gt; the lead on this:-)<br/>
