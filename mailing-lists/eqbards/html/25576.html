<div id="ygrps-yiv-665647528">Hello all - I just got back from a two week tour of Germany with my band.<br/>
Before I left we camped Ragefire for a cleric&#39;s epic - and he dropped a red<br/>
scale that my guild defaulted to me.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight we tried Gorenaire and got wiped twice.  That damn fear doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to care what your resistance is &lt;sigh&gt; got her down to 50 percent the second<br/>
try.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho - any advice from people who&#39;ve had success with this sucker?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Slyde</div>
