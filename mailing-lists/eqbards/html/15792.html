<div id="ygrps-yiv-747214589">I noticed the name Harmonic too Weiland.  I was in permafrost the other day<br/>
and saw the name come up when I did a /who list.  Didn&#39;t see the last name,<br/>
and he was anon, so didn&#39;t see the class, but it stuck in my mind.<br/>

Harmonic,<br/>
    I know you&#39;ve decided to take some time off from EQ, but the strangest<br/>
thing happened to me last night.  I was in High Keep, killing warriors while<br/>
my name cycled through the raider list (yawn), when low and behold a bard<br/>
came through the door by the name of -- you guessed it Harmonic Distortion!!<br/>
I asked him &quot;Harmonic? On this server?&quot;  He said yep!  Hmmmm.....<br/>
    Anyway, if you still lurk, tell me the inside scoop.  Have you restarted<br/>
on Erollisi Marr?  Or has Harmonic groupie-dom spread across servers now?<br/>
Please advise as I was quite taken by surprise.<br/>
