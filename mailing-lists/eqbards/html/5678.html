<div id="ygrps-yiv-87337743">Hmm well there will always be idiots in this game. Hell people pull off<br/>
Spectre Isle from time to time just to cause trains. Stuff like this is<br/>
going to happen from day to day even without kiting. I don&#39;t know about your<br/>
server but that&#39;s not a usual kiting scenario on mine. Not to mention there<br/>
is another kind of kiting that nobody seems to remember but that&#39;s DD<br/>
Kiting. A Wizard with a pair of jboots can kite just as well as a Necro,<br/>
Shaman, or a Druid. Granted for giants you would have to be high level but<br/>
take spectres the HP on them is so low for a mob that level that they are<br/>
actually easy to take out. Matter of fact a Wiz friend kites them from time<br/>
to time. So how does this fix kiting if your going to allow one class the<br/>
ability to do it? Kiting really isn&#39;t a big a problem as you make it out to<br/>
be and a lot of times in Oasis when people get killed and it&#39;s a druid or<br/>
shaman running it&#39;s usually because he ran into the giant&#39;s aggro radius by<br/>
accident and was running away from it. The reason I say that is because as<br/>
soon as I peg one giant with just one of my Necro&#39;s dots he is on me until<br/>
somebody else outdamages me. I hunt SG&#39;s in Oasis quite a bit so I&#39;ve<br/>
watched this for quite awhile. Hell with my druid friend when we hit 30 we<br/>
thought we would try a HG near Kithicore Zone line in West Commons. The HG<br/>
didn&#39;t touch a single newbie in fact some of them went up to it whacked it<br/>
with their weapons. Very rarely does a npc attack someting else if you cast<br/>
on it.<br/>

&gt;I hate to disagree with (seemingly) everyone here, but<br/>
&gt;Im HOPING that Verant does something about Kiting.  It<br/>
&gt;may not be a problem on your server, but on MM, its<br/>
&gt;ridiculous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Case in Point:<br/>
&gt;   NRO - Constantly, every level 14 Druid Kites Dorn<br/>
&gt;to be the &quot;Great Dorn Slayer&quot;.  In the process, he/she<br/>
&gt;usually gets about 10 or so folks killed.  Usually<br/>
&gt;those folks are just level 8ish newbies who just didnt<br/>
&gt;have time to see Dorn come over the rise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, so you say that it&#39;s because at lev 14, they are<br/>
&gt;new to Kiting, and don&#39;t know how to do it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Case in Point:<br/>
&gt;     Yesterday.  Three IDIOTS (and YES...I&#39;ll use that<br/>
&gt;term freely) decide to kite the Spectres in the Oasis.<br/>
&gt; OOPS...pulled too many...lets just kite them all over<br/>
&gt;the Oasis till we run out of mana and then zone.  When<br/>
&gt;all was said and done...63 corpses.  No lie or<br/>
&gt;exaggeration...we COUNTED them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Big problem is, this is not an unusual scenerio.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;seen more than a few &quot;Kited&quot; giants lose interest<br/>
&gt;(cause the Kiter got too far away) and rampage on<br/>
&gt;unsuspecting players WAY TOO LOW for a giant, and in<br/>
&gt;areas where Giants NEVER go...(like the NRO Fishing<br/>
&gt;villiage).  This effect is worse in those zones with a<br/>
&gt;lot of hills, where you cant see the mob coming until<br/>
&gt;its too late.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Verant, in doing nothing to prevent this, AND allowing<br/>
&gt;the players no means of recourse, have been VERY<br/>
&gt;irresponsible.  I&#39;m glad to see them take a stand, or<br/>
&gt;at least attempt to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I really don&#39;t mind if you want to kite that Griffawn<br/>
&gt;at level 12.  Go for it.  But...DONT GET ANYONE ELSE<br/>
&gt;KILLED.  Too many Kiters don&#39;t care.  The phrase &quot;I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;rather see 20 people die and get away than lose the<br/>
&gt;exp for dying myself&quot; has been chanted by WAY too many<br/>
&gt;Shaman, Druids, and Bards out there.  No WONDER kiting<br/>
&gt;classes get a bad powerleveling rep.<br/>
