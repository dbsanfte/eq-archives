<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-417475139">Lullaby still will interrupt NPC casters, here are my two experiences from <br/>
over the weekend.  The first was against the named bandit that hangs out in <br/>
North Karana.  Using lullaby I was able to easily take him out.  I killed <br/>
him a second time using fear/chain, this is another great combo for nix&#39;ing <br/>
casters.   The other was I was exploring solo in Permafrost using the <br/>
invisibility song.  and of course the song blinked on me (I hate that).  So <br/>
this Goblin Evoker starts nuking me into tomorrow, by the time I got to him <br/>
and switch to my weapons I was down below half health.  I started Lullaby <br/>
and started beating on him. I was actually winning, pounding on him and <br/>
interrupting his spells.  But when he ran my first chain failed and he was <br/>
able to call in help, they made quick work of me :(  Good thing I was bound <br/>
in Halas.<br/>

&gt;&gt;a caster!  Casters rule EverQuest, plain and simple.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re exactly right. I can usually take on a non-casting type yellow<br/>
&gt;conning derv alone. But I&#39;m very lucky if I can survive a green conning<br/>
&gt;derv or madman that is a caster.. It&#39;s almost humorous how they never seem<br/>
&gt;to run out of mana too.<br/>
