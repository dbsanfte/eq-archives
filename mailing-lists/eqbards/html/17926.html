That corner between the gargoyles and kitchen is safe too (out<br/>
of aggro radius) *except* when the vampire oracle walks by due<br/>
to a train.<br/>

&gt; We all lined up in the south east corner of the room while invis, we let<br/>

room.  Most reports I&#39;ve seen say to fight in there.  I&#39;ve<br/>
always pulled both rooms to the maid/butler and kitchen areas.<br/>
