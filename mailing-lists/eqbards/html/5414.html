<div id="ygrps-yiv-418653668">By all means keep the crested spalders they are a high level item and =<br/>
for you to have it at level 18 is great it&#39;s worth a lot more then a bs =<br/>
mantle. One other thing I suggest you do is get another pair of bronze =<br/>
bracers the ac to weight ratio is actually extremly great for bronze =<br/>
probably the best bronze pieces you can buy. If anything don&#39;t get arms =<br/>
as a bracer has better ac and less weight then the arms. Anyway just =<br/>
some suggesitons.<br/>

Yesterday, as I was about to Log off for the night A level 2 Enchanter =<br/>
was offering 30pp for a Sow at the Qeynos Gates.  I gave him a tell and =<br/>
was offered 100pp to take him from Qeynos to Rivervale to be twinked =<br/>
there by his level 50 char :).  Of course I accepted the offer and we =<br/>
ran down to Rivervale, in the end he died once and had to take the boat =<br/>
back across the Ocean from Erudin but eventually we got there safely and =<br/>
I was 100pp richer.<br/>
Today, as a further reward for my services the player logged on as his =<br/>
level 50 cleric and asked me to meet him at the Freeport Bank.  When I =<br/>
arrived he gave me the following for my help previously: A pair of =<br/>
Bronze Bracers, Elf Hide Gloves, Crested Spaulders.  I promptly thanked =<br/>
him and he left saying thanks.  As he was leaving a level 50 warrior in =<br/>
the bank was selling a Jagged Band for 50pp, so I telled him and =<br/>
purchased my new peice of jewelery immediately.  I then sold my old =<br/>
Amber ring, the 2 bronze bracers (too heavy for their ac), and my old =<br/>
Rusty Spiked shoulders to a Bard friend of mine for 40pp.  After that I =<br/>
met the Cleric again and he needed help buying spells for his Enchanter =<br/>
at the Caster Guild because everyone was dubious to him.  I helped him =<br/>
there and once again thanked him for his earlier gifts.  So now, I am =<br/>
wondering   if The Crested Spaulders ac:11 +6sta are good for me to use, =<br/>
or maybe I can trade it for things like A pair of Golden Amber earrings, =<br/>
a Second Jagged band, Bloodstained Mantle, A runed Bone Fork etc.  I am =<br/>
happy with my current Dual Weilding of a Barbed Leather whip and Dragoon =<br/>
dirk, so I think that Armor is the way to go.<br/>
Any help in this subject would be wonderful.<br/>
