<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718405980">Well,  last night I used DDD/COD/Heal in Perma extensively.  However, I did<br/>
this in the entry hall :)<br/>
We had 5 in our group: 18th Bard, 18th Shaman, 19th Shaman, 21st Shaman,<br/>
18th Ranger<br/>
One of the Shamans would bring between 1 and 5 gobbies down the hall, to<br/>
near the zone line.  After everyone engaged, I would crank up my songs.<br/>
Quite often, everyone would attack the yellow/red gob, and leave the green<br/>
one(s) alone.  I know that I dropped several greens without anyone ever<br/>
hitting them. (Gobs will run if they are real hurt, unless, as far as I<br/>
could tell, another gobbie that is stronger is still around.)  Even at that,<br/>
with the DOT damage, alot of them would drop long before they hit that first<br/>
turn.  Also, the ranger would snare the runners.  Several times I would go<br/>
halfway down the entrance to ensure a DOT on the runners, and would not get<br/>
the new spawn in the corner with it.  I would equate DDD/COD range to about<br/>
the same as hymn, and shorter than bellow.  I got close enough to bellow the<br/>
guy in the corner, without damaging him with my aoe&#39;s.<br/>

p.s. I did NOT try to use these songs much past the first ladder into Perma.<br/>
I do NOT know if this would cause a train, say at the Flag Room.  If you<br/>
want to try it, use it at your own risk :)<br/>

&gt;Melee range, or perhaps a bit more.  Very short, shorter than Hymn (or<br/>
&gt;even with, I don&#39;t recall).  It&#39;s for this reason I prefer Chords or<br/>
&gt;Denon&#39;s to bellow, as the overall damage inflicted is greater.  It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;as noticeable since you don&#39;t get the instant hit report, but there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;definitely more of it (especially if you swap in your lute between swings<br/>
&gt;;).<br/>
