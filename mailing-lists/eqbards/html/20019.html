<div id="ygrps-yiv-15698104">Swarmcaller is one of the top Ranger only 2HS weapons in the game.  <br/>
My sources ( www.maximumeq.com ) say it&#39;s worth ~20k.  Those same <br/>
sources say the Jade Mace is worth ~12k.  Face value says, no it&#39;s <br/>
not a good trade. :)  But, consider the Jade Mace is the best Bard <br/>
wieldable 1HB weapon in the game AND has better dam/delay ratio than <br/>
the Symphonic Saber and Harmonic Dagger (without the proc).  You&#39;ll <br/>
do MUCH better with the mace in your primary hand than with a Yak... <br/>
Keep the 2 Yaks, &quot;play&quot; with them for a little while, then sell it <br/>
off. :) I&#39;d see what else this guy could cough up to even out the <br/>
trade a little and take it in a heartbeat. :)<br/>
<br/>
On a similar note - I&#39;ve acquired an Arbitor&#39;s Combine Longsword in a <br/>
trade for a Necklace of Superiority.  The Stats, 2HS 30/43 +15 Wis <br/>
+25 Mana War/Rng/Pal/SK, have Ranger and Pally written all over it.  <br/>
maximumeq has a value on it at ~30k.  I&#39;m trying to work a trade <br/>
for &quot;several&quot; high end Bard items, but am having trouble finding <br/>
anyone with more than 1, lol.  The best I&#39;ve found so far is Singing <br/>
Steel Gaunts and Selo&#39;s Drum (I&#39;m trying to get 1 more item out of <br/>
her).  The person I&#39;m working with thinks the Drum is worth the same <br/>
as an FBSS.  I had the opportunity (without the cash) to buy a Selo&#39;s <br/>
Drum for 5k awhile ago... Anyone know a real value on this?  <br/>

Cringing at the thought of one more person on Xegony /auction &lt;insert <br/>
item here&gt; Looking for Bard Items!  :p<br/>
