&gt; Let me offer a different place:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mid to High 30s xp, 3+ group members.<br/>
&gt; Lower Guk Live Side.  Sit at the base of the ramp as you zone in.<br/>
&gt; Pull anything you see.  Easily get 15% xp per hour with a decent tank.<br/>
&gt; Puller should be safe pulling from as far in as he can.  37.5 minute<br/>
&gt; spawn time, so lots of different stuff to kill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only problem with that is, you&#39;re going to be awfully tired of lower guk<br/>
by your mid-late 40&#39;s. Personally, I&#39;d put off going there until<br/>
everywhere else you can possibly hunt is green. At mid-high 30&#39;s I think<br/>
the king room in perma is still quite blue. I&#39;m not sure when the exp<br/>
tapers off in the king and other deep areas in Sol A, but I&#39;d check<br/>
there. Both of these places require good parties before you go though.<br/>
