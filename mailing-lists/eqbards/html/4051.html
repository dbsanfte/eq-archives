&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone have any ideas of places to go for some good quests? Ive gone to<br/>
&gt;Valen, and also delivered some mail. Do you guys know of any quests that<br/>
&gt;give instruments? (Ones you can keep), or songs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny you should mention that.....<br/>
The (only) Bard-oriented Quest in Kelethin is designed for somewhat<br/>
low-level bards (1-4th).  Not to worried about spoiling this one - it&#39;s<br/>
been all over the place.  Just talk to Sylia, the Guildmaster in the<br/>
Songweaver&#39;s Guild, she&#39;ll tell you what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Conveniently, that&#39;s also a good place to start on a mail run, being the<br/>
central collection-point for Faydwer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s another, much higher level Quest that gives, as a<br/>
reward, a song - but that the song might be anything.<br/>
<br/>
Still hoping for more magical instruments.... <br/>
