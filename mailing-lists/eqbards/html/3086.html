<b>Subject:</b> Re: Old Question -- Has JM or anyone official ever answered it? Jig a nd Mana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307723362"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Does the Jig really effect Mana regen rate?  I still haven&#39;t been able to do<br/>
&gt;any scientific experimentation, and I know that while this was discussed<br/>
&gt;pretty heavily a while back, I&#39;m not sure I ever saw any sort of definitive<br/>
&gt;answer come from it, just theories about stamina and meditation being on the<br/>
&gt;same pulse rate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone done any hard studies?  Or did JM answer this in a post I missed<br/>
&gt;while on vacation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the tests I have seen described were not very rigorous in the testing process. For instance,<br/>
testing the time to full up a bubble at the beginning against a bubble near the end is not a good<br/>
test. We don&#39;t know if there are variances in how the mana graphic is displayed or if there are<br/>
different regen rates at different levels. Anyway, I AM hoping to find the definitive word on this,<br/>
based on imperic evidence or just J.M.C.s word *smiles*<br/>
