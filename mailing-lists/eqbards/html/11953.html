&gt; &gt; Think for a moment.  If CT *really* had a death touch, what<br/>
&gt; &gt; would he do the moment he discovered mortals were messing<br/>
&gt; &gt; around in his realm?  DT all of them.  Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>
&gt; &gt; do if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>
&gt; &gt; game, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; super-powers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unless you lack the imagination to do anything better.<br/>

would you ever die?<br/>
<br/>
If not, and a mob with this power can be killed, then what&#39;s<br/>
the point of giving him this power?  All it&#39;s done is made him<br/>
more difficult to kill.  Well, there are lots of ways to make<br/>
mobs more difficult to kill without resorting to random<br/>
insta-death.<br/>
<br/>
You folks are trying to justify the DT saying that he&#39;s a god<br/>
and should have it.  That&#39;s fine and good, but if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
use it like a being of super-intelligence, then I don&#39;t see it<br/>
being much different than death by router crash - i.e. it gets<br/>
applied more or less randomly and without reason.  You can&#39;t<br/>
justify either being necessary for the game IMHO.<br/>
