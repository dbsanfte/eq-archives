<div id="ygrps-yiv-16937725">Geoffry, Thank you for taking the time to answer so many bard questions.  I <br/>
have a few follow ups if you do not mind.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why do we not have the ability to play Invisibility and See Invisibility <br/>
songs together? Or perhaps allowing our see invisible to be played on top of <br/>
a casters invisible or camouflage?<br/>
A: Any effect that hits you while invisible turns you visible. We recently <br/>
added the See Invisible component to the Bard´┐¢s invisibility song - this <br/>
should help the problem. (Or you can just follow the cool sparkles)<br/>
<br/>
Follow up: As you most likely know by now this change did not go live on the <br/>
2/3/2000 patch.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Q: Is Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (Lvl 15) supposed to have a memory blur <br/>
component?<br/>
A: Nope.<br/>
<br/>
Follow up: The old spell lists from Beta indicate that Lullaby nix&#39;d the <br/>
hate list.  And in the first few months of retail it did so as well (work <br/>
very well when partnered with a wizard or rogue).  Now the hate list nix&#39;ing <br/>
no longer seems to work.  Was this removed, or is this a function of using <br/>
the song on higher level mobs?<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Q: Ok this is a personal question and probably completely trivial, the <br/>
enameled black chestplate from lower guk is a black plate that is wearable <br/>
by all the plate wearing classes except Bard. I wear an inferior black plate <br/>
because I like the black plate look, can this plate be made available to <br/>
Bards?<br/>
A: No reason. I changed it so that Bards can use it too - should be in this <br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
Follow up: Now if there where only some black plate arms and bracers that <br/>
were bard wearable.  My woodelf wants to channel Johnny Cash.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are there enhanced effects for these songs when the proper instrument is <br/>
equipped? In the case of Aquatic Ayre, is the enhancement range increased? <br/>
For Sirens and Pixie Strike, does it increased duration, chance of success, <br/>
or both?<br/>
A: Instruments only effect the primary effects of the song (healing, buff, <br/>
attack speed, etc.) - not the range/duration/chance of success, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Follow up: The instrument portions of Fufil´┐¢s Curtailing Chant, Tuyen´┐¢s <br/>
Chant of Flame, and Tuyen´┐¢s Chant of Frost are still broken.  Using an <br/>
instrument does not increase the damage or the resist debuff.  Also contray <br/>
to one of your earlier posts McVaxius Berserker Crescendo does not require <br/>
an instrument.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Q: Can you explain your thoughts behind Psalm of Purity and Psalm of <br/>
Vitality? These songs are simply useless since any 5th level druid and 4th <br/>
level cleric can cure the disease and poison these songs are supposed to <br/>
protect from. I mean truly 39 points of disease protection for a 29th level <br/>
song?<br/>
A: These songs, in addition to protecting from poison and disease, also have <br/>
chances to remove a poison or disease effect on you. They are a mixture of a <br/>
cure and a resistance buff in one.<br/>
<br/>
Follow up: Several bards I know have tested the curative aspect of these <br/>
Psalms in the past and found this not to work.  Is the chance of a cure very <br/>
low?<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the <br/>
following: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon, Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, Solon&#39;s Song <br/>
of the Sirens, Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike, and Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles?<br/>
A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance, none.<br/>
<br/>
Follow up: If Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens is not enhanced by using a wind <br/>
instrument then why is it listed as a wind song?  Also using a wind <br/>
instrument with Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike does NOT increase the MR debuff.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for adressing these issues.<br/>
