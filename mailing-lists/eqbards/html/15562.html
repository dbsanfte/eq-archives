<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649906750">So, I really have been reading these posts and I&#39;m sure these questions have<br/>
been answered but...........<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just starting to group up with more than two people with my Bard.  What<br/>
songs are the best to do?  I&#39;ve been using buff song plus hymn for the most<br/>
part....and do most people use their weapons or instruments at my level<br/>
(20)... I do have a claw and a harpoon from Kedge so I do quite a bit of<br/>
damage if I&#39;m fighting...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)<br/>
