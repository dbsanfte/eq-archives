<div id="ygrps-yiv-504459961">-----Original Message-----&gt;So based on what you are saying, I could go into<br/>
Feerot, target an ogre<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;guard (bouncer),  sing the carillion and make it to where I&#39;m not KOS<br/>
&gt;anymore, and then merrily waltz around the zone with no worry of ever<br/>
&gt;getting attacked by any ogre guards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*laughs* oh that is EXACTLY what I am saying...um, or not. I am willing to<br/>
bet you couldn&#39;t charisma them out of KoS. it took a lot of gnoll killing<br/>
before I could get the Highpass guards to like me enough to GIVE them a<br/>
gnoll skin.<br/>
