&gt; &gt;It&#39;s too bad sit ins are a bit overdone now. Does anyone else think<br/>
&gt; &gt;random death touches are probably one of the cheeziest cop out design<br/>
&gt; &gt;decisions ever made? It reminds me of something a 12 year old playing DM<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are THINGS that are going to have Instant Death type of spells. Guess<br/>
&gt; what? Gods are the ones.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even in my tabletop type game, there are situations where we KNOW, if we<br/>
&gt; go in and mess with trying to fight something, they are so far above us, we<br/>
&gt; will be creamed on the bottom of his shoe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The company I work for made a tank game.  Most of the work we<br/>
do involves simulators for the U.S. military, so we made it as<br/>
faithful to the real thing as we could.  The communications<br/>
and map use the same klunky monochrome interface on the real<br/>
M1 (as near as we could model it), and the big one - generally<br/>
you get hit once and you&#39;re dead.<br/>
<br/>
The play testers hated it.  We had to add an &quot;arcade mode&quot;<br/>
where you could take 2 or 3 hits before being knocked out of<br/>
action.  (We also had to change the map so it was omniscient<br/>
so you could always see all friendly units - something I<br/>
guarantee you real tank commanders wish they had but don&#39;t - <br/>
but I digress.)<br/>
<br/>
The testers felt those were minimum requirements for making<br/>
the game playable and fun.  Sometimes, what makes logical<br/>
sense has to be sacrificed for playability.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The fact that Cazic Thule is killable (without casualties even<br/>
- happened on my server) contradicts this notion.  If a<br/>
well-coordinated group can take out Cazic while suffering<br/>
minimal casualties, then giving him a death touch is a<br/>
cop-out.  You couldn&#39;t make him buff or smart enough to kill<br/>
players, so you made him do it automatically.<br/>
<br/>
Think for a moment.  If CT *really* had a death touch, what<br/>
would he do the moment he discovered mortals were messing<br/>
around in his realm?  DT all of them.  Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>
do if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>
game, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>
super-powers.<br/>
