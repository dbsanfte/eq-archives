<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774205297">Looks like they are really into roleplaying but just dont know how to do<br/>
this - I am serious.  How do you involve or at least open the doors for<br/>
involvement in some kind of ongoing saga to their whole customer base?  Or<br/>
at least the ones who are interested as well as those befabled &#39;casual<br/>
gamers&#39; And them keep things coordinated on all the servers.  Some guides I<br/>
have talked to tell tales of how extremely difficult it is to have  the<br/>
&quot;same thing&quot; happen on all of the servers at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I bet part of the answer will be through re-capping and or previewing or<br/>
pre-registering participants through web sites where the saga info can be<br/>
distributed more efficiently (ie you dont have to be online at a give time<br/>
to get the info you need for when you do go online.)  Any how - seems that<br/>
they are thinking about it too.<br/>
<br/>
Also go see the quest stuff from Paneel posted on EQ Vault (if you dont mind<br/>
mild spoiler)<br/>

The History of Norrath<br/>
[Why did the Combine Empire fall? Is there a way to find out?]<br/>
<br/>
Not at this point. The history was meant to be revealed as part of in-game<br/>
dynamic quests. However, it&#39;s been our experience that the stories either<br/>
don&#39;t get told, or don&#39;t get told correctly. We&#39;re currently working at a<br/>
better way to distribute information, so that people who aren&#39;t able to<br/>
participate directly can still understand what is going on.<br/>
<br/>
[Is it possible the world can be changed in a significant way, like Qeynos<br/>
getting burned to the ground or something? Or this this &quot;living, changing<br/>
world&quot; going to consist of modifying player abilities to simply make the<br/>
game harder?]<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a bit argumentative, because it makes the assumption that the game<br/>
world hasn&#39;t changed in the manner you suggest, when in-fact it has.<br/>
<br/>
The change to Kithicor is a good example. How many people realize that there<br/>
was a constant storyline that took over 6 weeks to complete with nearly 2<br/>
dozen dynamic quests completed across all servers? How many people actually<br/>
know the story, compared to the number that think one day the GMs just<br/>
dressed up and ran around killing newbies?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested in discussing your ideas in regards to how these<br/>
happenings can be explained to everyone.</div>
