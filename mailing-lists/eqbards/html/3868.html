<div id="ygrps-yiv-137318999">If you are a bard (I can probably assume so) you have to realize that<br/>
singing or using your music ability at all (which you will be doing<br/>
continuosly ifyou are a good bard) will prevent you from using the hide<br/>
command (I don&#39;t know about sneak...but would assume it is the same). I hope<br/>
that helps...try turning off your songs and seeing if you can at least try<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; Ok heres my problem...2 months ago i hit the hide button and the thing<br/>
&gt; never recycled back through.´┐¢ Well, when i recieved the sneak skill two<br/>
&gt; lvls ago, i put 3 points into it hoping to try it out...nothing.´┐¢ The<br/>
&gt; hide skill is not allowing me to use it.´┐¢ So i thought maybe if i put<br/>
&gt; some more points into the sneak skill it would cycle the button through<br/>
&gt; faster.´┐¢ It didn&#39;t.´┐¢ So far i have put 8 skill points into sneak and<br/>
&gt; have not been able to use it once.´┐¢ Is this normal?´┐¢ or do you all think<br/>
&gt; that maybe mine is screwed up?<br/>
