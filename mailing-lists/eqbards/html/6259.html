<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622974291">What I don&#39;t understand is WHY if we can duel we can&#39;t be as effective against mobs?  It&#39;s something that&#39;s been bugging me lately if we can&#39;t fight as well as a fighter.. and can&#39;t use our more powerful atk songs for fear of being overrun isn&#39;t there a problem. I&#39;m not saying we aren&#39;t useful I know we are I&#39;ve kept more powerful groups alive in hostile areas for months.. but is it just me or are we being TOOO limited in our role options?  Can some of you higher ups explain?<br/>

&gt; Last night while I was testing out the CoD and DDD with my guildmate we<br/>
&gt; were in duel mode. While testing, my guildmates would make fun of a bard vs<br/>
&gt; a cleric how she would wup my ass.  She is a lvl 39 clerics that can solo a<br/>
&gt; Raider in HK just fine.  While me being a lvl 35 bard cannot even solo a<br/>
&gt; hard blue guard, haha.	So anyway after my testing (which I posted on<br/>
&gt; another post), I told her why not duel and find out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Duel start<br/>
&gt; Cleric blast u for 121 dmg<br/>
&gt; bard play fear song.<br/>
&gt; Cleric runs<br/>
&gt; Bard chain<br/>
&gt; Bard beat the crap out of the cleric<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I stop the fight because we know who would win from this, hehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She gains new respect for bard as a fighter, hehe.<br/>
