&gt; Hmm, I was in cazic last night, when my favorite<br/>

&gt; him, ah, he&#39;s charmed.  Hmm, ranger is also wacking<br/>
&gt; me.  This isn&#39;t good.  So I start charming back.  It<br/>
&gt; seemed to work, I wasn&#39;t getting wacked any more. <br/>
&gt; This was moments before our entire sever crashed for 3<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the change only applies to summoned pets.  They really<br/>
should make it consistent with how player pets work.  If my<br/>
mage friend is killed, his pet suicides.  If I kill that NPC<br/>
necro who has somehow managed to summon 7 pets, they should<br/>
all suicide.  Unless memblur/atone/fear were fixed as ways to<br/>
quick-kill NPC pets, this nerf is aimed squarely at bards.<br/>
