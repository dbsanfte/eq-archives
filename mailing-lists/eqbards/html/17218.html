<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090763631">I have been using screetch quite a bit lately as well and did some informal<br/>
testing and was not able to see any significant difference using a horn with<br/>
screetch.  I did notice this:  screetch checks & refreshes every tick if you<br/>
start it and leave it going (unlike other songs that have a fixed duration<br/>
of 2 or 3 ticks) but it also has a duration of 3 or 4 ticks (although<br/>
sometimes it will stop prematurely).  So I found that I can fear, chain,<br/>
whistle or fear, chain, chords and have a bout a 50 - 50 chance of getting<br/>
hit when the fear expires.  To get hit less I will go fear, chain; fear,<br/>
chords; fear, chain; fear, whistle; etc. Also, if they are casters or<br/>
healers, keeping them feared will prevent them from casting.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Screech and horn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was killing HG last night with a group that contained another bard and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; other bard told me that using a horn doesn&#39;t increase the effectiveness of<br/>
&gt; Screech.  Is this correct?  Does the song just check your brass skill but<br/>
&gt; actually using a horn doesn&#39;t do anything?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems to me that if a song has a  specific skill listed that using the<br/>
&gt; associated instrument would increase its affect.<br/>
