&gt;I really wasn&#39;t asking or trying to ask without asking, but since you<br/>

&gt;We&#39;re vaguely neighbors.  I live in Wilton, New Hampshire.  I&#39;m 51, father<br/>
&gt;of 2 sons and I have 3 grandchildren.  I more or less play any musical<br/>
&gt;instrument I can get my hands on, with specialty in guitar, trombone,<br/>
&gt;banjo, and learning piano.  One of my sons plays EverQuest and the other<br/>
&gt;will eventually, but I&#39;ll leave it up to them to reveal themselves (they&#39;re<br/>
&gt;not here).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My characters do tend to be a bit paternalistic.  :-)}<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There probably is a &quot;most common age bracket&quot; for players in EQ&#39;s <br/>
demographics. I don&#39;t know exactly what it is, but I probly fall into it <br/>
(male, mid-20&#39;s). However, in this game and even in Quake, I know people who <br/>
play ranging from ages 11 to the early 60&#39;s (I&#39;ve lanned with a regular <br/>
gaming group since network doom debuted). Half of the female EQ characters I <br/>
have met were males playing females, and the other half were actually <br/>
females (or wouldn&#39;t disclose the truth). I think we get a wide variety and <br/>
a very interesting mix, actually. Never thought about playing a female, but <br/>
I might just do it seeing as my nickname is kinda unisex (I get the &quot;are you <br/>
a guy or a girl&quot; question all the time when people ask about my handle).<br/>
<br/>
I played a female wood elf druid to like lvl 4 and it was pretty funny and <br/>
interesting because everyone would &quot;mac&quot; on me. It was also cool because I&#39;d <br/>
get people casting high level buffs on me when I was lowe-level. Matter of <br/>
fact, in the first half-hour of her existance, I had a dwarf walk up, start <br/>
hitting on my character (something about swimwear?), and he cast Center on <br/>
me. I went nuts on the newbie crits. A first level druid with 75hp or so, <br/>
heh..<br/>
