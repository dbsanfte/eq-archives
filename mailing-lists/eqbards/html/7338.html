Ok....as far as i know<br/>
1.the Slime Crystal Staff does Drop off of King Xorbb in the gorge.<br/>
2.The Water Crystal Staff drops off of Webclaw Murkwave in Lake Rathe...I<br/>
believe he is a froglock.  he is definitely a caster, and he is in the water. <br/>
if you try to pull him out of the water, he 32K&#39;s himself.  So, you have to<br/>
fight him underwater.  He will just sit there and bomb until one of you is<br/>
dead.<br/>
3.  The ice crystal staff comes from Permafrost, off of the Goblin Scryer.<br/>
4.  The Fire Crystal Staff comes from Sol A, off of the Goblin Drunkard.<br/>
---------the above is correct, below is rumor----------------------------<br/>
5.  I believe you turn them into the Visiting Priestess in Najena.  She is a<br/>
rare spawn in the Ogre Captain room.  (she doesn&#39;t spawn in place of the<br/>
captain, but in place of one of his guards) Lvl 24 DE Cleric.  I would like to<br/>
say that I have serious doubts as to whether this quest is still in, as i have<br/>
not heard that it was do-able since beta.  <br/>
I provide this information without any warranty, express or implied, and<br/>
absolve myself of any responsibility should you give the staves to her and get<br/>
a &quot;Thank You Very Much&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I live to stockpile item info,<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
