&gt;Well, my initial intention with the warning was based on info I found on<br/>
&gt;AllaKhazam&#39;s website and I sent out the warning not based on whether I can<br/>
&gt;verify the info, but more on a &quot;this info needs to be verified&quot; level<br/>
&gt;because I would hate to see you give away another dirk in vain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the case of the Order of Thunder medallion that was changed in the last<br/>
&gt;patch for example, we learned that there were two separate versions of the<br/>
&gt;medallion and I happened to have the one version with AC which was then<br/>
&gt;removed with the patch and then restored again the next day.  This leads me<br/>
&gt;to speculate that IF it is true that the raider&#39;s cap has been changed to<br/>
&gt;Halfling only, THEN it is likely that there may be 2 versions of it.  All<br/>
&gt;speculation - but we should verify with info from players who have the cap<br/>
&gt;now from before the patch and players who obtain it henceforth. </span></blockquote></div>
