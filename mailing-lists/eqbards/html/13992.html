 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a bit more draconian on this:  Your character gets to kill<br/>
each named mob only once in his lifetime.  After that, if you<br/>
kill it again, nothing drops.  If you contribute to a kill, it<br/>
is considered &quot;your kill&quot; only if you look at the loot on<br/>
it.  You would have to be a minimum level to loot named mobs.<br/>

The last one is an important point.  Say Verant wants to make<br/>
Dwarven Work Boots so rare that only 1 in 10 people have them.  <br/>
Right now, they just make the mob, drop, and camp time so<br/>
frustratingly long that only 1 in 10 players has the patience<br/>
or ability to camp for them.<br/>
<br/>
Under my system, the ghost could spawn every 30 minutes.  If<br/>
you wanted to try for DWB, you&#39;d get a group together.  You<br/>
kill the ghost, loot, and if you&#39;re the lucky 1 in 10 you get<br/>
DWB.  If not, too bad.  You killed the ghost, congratulations,<br/>
now move on.  If you really want the DWB, you&#39;ll have to trade<br/>
for them.  But instead of spending 8 hours camping the site<br/>
(and thus blocking other people from getting their shot at<br/>
DWBs), you&#39;d move on to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
This would require Verant to work on generating enough quests<br/>
and other interesting things to do so that we wouldn&#39;t run out<br/>
of things to try to get.  Something they may not be capable of<br/>
doing.<br/>
