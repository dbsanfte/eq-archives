<div id="ygrps-yiv-253424275">Yea, &quot;hug that right wall like your life depended on it - cuz it does!&quot;<br/>
that was the advice I was given after my first and only train through there<br/>
last nite. <br/>
<br/>
Things were going real good - seemingly steady stream of blues  - xp was<br/>
good enough to ding me into 35.  Then it got slower - duh -- level hell.  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, so now down to bardic business.  Our crew: 40 enchanter, 40 shadow<br/>
knight, 36 troll warrior, 41 cleric & your truly the 34 going on 35 bard. We<br/>
went to the exec(utioners?) room and camped there.  We also pulled from the<br/>
savant room -- someone else was pulling the other two things from there<br/>
(forget their names.)<br/>
<br/>
The froggie knights were no problem and even mulitple pulls were no problem.<br/>
Our enchanter handled all the crowd control.  My job was anthem, melee some<br/>
(Staff of Writhing procs DD of 48 non-melee plus hits pretty well on its<br/>
own), mana song & after combat heals.<br/>
<br/>
The only real threat were those froggie wizzards who would come in a bit<br/>
after the first pulled mob and sit at the edge of the room and play Burn the<br/>
Bard!  Yowzer I was down to under a bub once or twice before our cleric<br/>
slapped a heal on me.  I had been weaving psalm of warmth with anthem for<br/>
the damage shield - love to see them mobs burning them selves when they take<br/>
a whack at us. (FYI - I finally figured out what they mean by damage shield:<br/>
Psalm of Warmth works like the Ranger/Druid Barbs & Thorns shields - if the<br/>
mob hits a Psalm  of Warmth shielded player - the mob takes some damage -<br/>
duh!  You see the message &quot;a mob is burned...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
After a couple nasty burn attacks from these wizzies, I went to buffing with<br/>
guardian and a drum from the time the puller went out to fetch until the<br/>
enchanter managed to get them all sorted out after the puller and all of the<br/>
mobs returned.  I guess I should have been stacking guardian and elemental<br/>
with the drum. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, my questions are:  how do you know what attacks (fire based or cold<br/>
based) mobs are more susceptable to?  Ie, I have heard that its pretty<br/>
useless to hit the mobs in Lava storm with fire based attacks. <br/>
<br/>
Second, does psalm of cooling provide a cold based damage shield? <br/>
