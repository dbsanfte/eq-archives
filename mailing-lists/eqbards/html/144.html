&gt; The other day while coming across a particular warrior on a <br/>
&gt; venture, I noticed how he would start fighting something that he <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t handle and constantly rely on others to finish off his <br/>
&gt; beasty or zone (zoned more often than not.)  I thought a song <br/>
&gt; might bring the young warrior some courage, but he didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
&gt; appreciate my tune?  Has any other bard had this problem?  The <br/>
&gt; lyrics are below--perhaps a fellow bard can advise me on possible <br/>
&gt; alterations?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brave Sir Robin,<br/>
&gt; Bravely ran away!<br/>
&gt; When danger reared its ugly head<br/>
&gt; He bravely tucked his tail and fled!<br/>
&gt; Bravely bravely bravely<br/>
&gt;  Brave Sir Robin<br/>
&gt; Bravely ran away<br/>
&gt; Brave Sir Robin<br/>
&gt; Never becomes afraid<br/>
&gt; To have his liver cut out<br/>
&gt; and his head bashed in<br/>
&gt; and his heart ripped out<br/>
&gt; and his eyes pushed in<br/>
&gt; and his arms torn off<br/>
&gt; and his bowels removed<br/>
&gt; and his toes cut off<br/>
&gt; and his ribs crushed in<br/>
&gt; Bravely bravely bravely<br/>
&gt; Brrrave Sir Robin<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why didn&#39;t he enjoy my melody?<br/>

&gt; btw-in case anyone is too young, or just didn&#39;t know--this <br/>
&gt; message was just for fun (as if everyone didn&#39;t catch the <br/>
&gt; reference on the first line!!)<br/>
