&gt; Here is the part I think he is referring to.  I would interpret it somewhat<br/>
&gt; differently.   I dont read &quot;never&quot; in here - just that it will take a lot<br/>
&gt; longer in real time.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;3) Do you really want elite, extremely rare kOOL dOOds (power-gamers) to<br/>
&gt; be the only recipients of high-level armor?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First, throw the statement about &quot;kOOL dOOds&quot; and power-gamers out the<br/>
&gt; window. One has nothing to do with the other. People who put forth similar<br/>
&gt; effort should reap similar reward. Does that mean that the guy who plays 15<br/>
&gt; hours a day will get his armor before the guy who plays 10 hours per week?<br/>
&gt; Probably. Should it be any different? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately you have to read between the lines with Abashi-speak. If<br/>
they keep moving the bar up faster than the &quot;average&quot; player can<br/>
advance, than the time when they can do this is effectively never.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you think that &quot;after Verant ceases all development on Everquest&quot;<br/>
is an acceptable time frame of course.<br/>
<br/>
I do object to people always tossing in the k00l d00d and power gamer<br/>
cards though. As Brad stated a long time ago that he expected the<br/>
average player to make 50 in a year and we are now into month 11 I<br/>
really don&#39;t think the power gamer card is really that effective<br/>
anymore. It now seems to basically mean &quot;anyone higher level than me&quot;.<br/>
