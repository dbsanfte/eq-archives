<div id="ygrps-yiv-517278430">How is button pushing a skill?  How is pushing buttons repetitively<br/>
for hours and hours not twitchy?  The purpose of Harmony is not to provide<br/>
some AI that would somehow be superior to a player&#39;s decisions.  The purpose<br/>
is to replace button mashing with a simple script.  The Skill a Bard Player<br/>
needs is to know what songs to play at what times.  Harmony would only be<br/>
appropriate for those particular times when song selection is a no-brainer<br/>
and changes infrequently (fighting the same type of mob in the same type of<br/>
situation over and over).  The addition of this feature, which should not be<br/>
a SKILL which has a rating or increases, would not require anyone to use it.<br/>
It would level the playing field.  It would help people with bad<br/>
connections, but it would not hurt people with good connections.  If you<br/>
have a fast connection and want to continue to mash buttons, you would still<br/>
be free to do so.   <br/>

&gt; 5. No harmony skill.  There has to be some skill at playing the class.<br/>
&gt; Playing a bard is not twitchy.  I weave 2 songs all the time despite 500ms<br/>
&gt; ping.  Its not twitching to hit 2 keys about 6 seconds apart.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
	&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   No thanks, there&#39;s some skills that a player just has to have.  This is<br/>
&gt; akin to a caster knowing when he can cast in combat & not be interrupted,<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; knowing how long to wait before casting so not to magetaunt a critter off<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; fighter.<br/>
