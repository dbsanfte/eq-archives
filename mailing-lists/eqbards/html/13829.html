<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618672825">Well by reducing crowding, you do have the OPTION to dungeon crawl if<br/>
you want to take it.  This is pretty much what my group used to do in<br/>
Paw (since we were alone in there) and UpperGuk, since often the squire<br/>
is the only guy we can take who is camped...  It would be nice to have<br/>
that option in other dungeons as well.<br/>
<br/>
BTW my group killed our first guards this week!  Woohoo, very exciting<br/>
for us, scratch two off my permanent agro list (I keep track of<br/>
everything which has killed me, and get revenge as soon as possible). <br/>
Dark Elf guards and stone guardians...<br/>

&gt; duplicated each zone so many times that each party were<br/>

&gt; only see maybe one special mob per night while the camp party<br/>
&gt; would see multiple.  Too little or too much.<br/>
