<br/>
Always great to see another bard and especially one on Innoruuk (my server<br/>
too!) I cant imagine who thinks you need 150+ cha to be effective.  I dont<br/>
have that kind of cha and do as well as can be expected.  It&#39;s good to be<br/>
thinking ahead and high str and cha that you have rolled seem just fine to<br/>
me.  I am considering that sta might be worth while as it is rather hard to<br/>
add later on where both str and cha can be boosted with items as well as agi<br/>
and dex.  Stamina in stats adds to you hp and ac I think (or is it only<br/>
p?)  - yes we have a sta song and depending on your weps (and friends to<br/>
buff you) you can use that.  In EQ today, Level is God, AC Is King, and<br/>
resists are your best friends.  All the other stats are marginal after you<br/>
get them to a decent level (around 100 or so).<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to send me a /tell next time you are online and I might have some<br/>
stuff to help get you started.  See ya soon,<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Cha<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am a half elf bard. I went with 95 str and 90 cha. I have been going<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; cha over other stats. I got +7 cha +5 dex rings and the earings that add<br/>
+5<br/>
&gt; cha and +2 ac. thats 114 cha. I am more of a team player then a soloest! I<br/>
&gt; was wondering if thats enough cha. Or should I go back and remake my bard<br/>
&gt; with more cha and less str, because I was told by a bard in the game you<br/>
&gt; need 150+ cha to do anything with your songs like charm and croud control<br/>
&gt; above 30+ in level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this true?!?!?<br/>
