<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834883670"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Yes, I&#39;m Weiland. Level 4 from Queynos.  Just started 3 days ago.  Any<br/>
&gt;suggestion on how to level up quicker?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Going from level 4 to level 5 is extremely fast and easy.  Just run around <br/>
the newbie area singing the level 2 song, and the wimp monsters will flock <br/>
to you as fast as you can bash them.  (But be careful to stay far away from <br/>
guards and merchants!  Just about every bard has been accidentally killed <br/>
by singing one of the area effect spells too close to a NPC.)<br/>
