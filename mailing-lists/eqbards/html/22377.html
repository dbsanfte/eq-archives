<div id="ygrps-yiv-489498159">I have done this albeit rare, I generally prefer to watch the battle over<br/>
staring at the hot boxes.  It was usually only where high resistances were<br/>
needed, like Kithicor.  I was around level 29 or 30 at the time so I wasn&#39;t<br/>
a battery.  It was set up like this:<br/>
Slot 1: Anthem<br/>
Slot 2: Elemental Rythms<br/>
Slot 3: Primary hand<br/>
Slot 4: Secondary hand<br/>
Slot 5: Inventory slot<br/>
Slot 6: Inventory slot<br/>
<br/>
Depending on how fast you get you can do it like this:  While moving the<br/>
primary weapon out of the primary slot start up your instrument song, drop<br/>
the primary weapon on the drum in the inventory then drop the drum on the<br/>
secondary weapon.  Keep the secondary weapon in your cursor, don&#39;t put it<br/>
in the inventory.  Once it pulses start another song and swap the secondary<br/>
weapon and the instrument, drop the instrument on the primary weapon and<br/>
equip it.  Once you get good at this you can try taking out one of the<br/>
inventory slots in the hot bank and replace it with a third song.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three to four songs<br/>
&gt;but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>
&gt;question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory slots, and #2 bank<br/>
&gt;set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, switch to #1, switch<br/>
&gt;out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new song without<br/>
&gt;missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one of those things<br/>
&gt;that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to switch hotkey<br/>
&gt;banks...<br/>
