 </span></blockquote>Oracles never impressed me much (well, okay, at level 7 or 8<br/>
they did in E.C.)  On the other hand, bandit spell-casters seem<br/>
to spawn in two&#39;s in West Karanas.  At a camp of 6, it&#39;s not<br/>
uncommon to see 4 blue to green (to a 15) casters.  Even the<br/>
green casters tend to resist Lament very often, and suddenly<br/>
you&#39;re getting nuked, hard.  You can die in a hurry in those<br/>
cases (and all I wanted was that green lady with the sword!!)</div>
