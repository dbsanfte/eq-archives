<br/>
Fighting same stuff as you - with a Pallidin fiend - we got some multi-mob<br/>
pulls and I used Lullaby to put the un-invited guests to sleep while we<br/>
whacked down the reaver.  Then used heal to heal up some before dealing with<br/>
the 2 or 3 extra wardog nippers.  So, heal in battle is not &#39;useless&#39; - it<br/>
helps.  <br/>
<br/>
Get a med qual bear skin and 15gp (maybe more - better take 25 or 30 gp just<br/>
to be sure) find Chanda Miller in the Qeynos Hills and tell her &#39;baobob sent<br/>
me&#39; and she will talk to you about how she can make you some bear skin<br/>
&#39;clothes&#39; - have her make you some boots.  The stats are good - very close<br/>
to banded and they are not heavy.  Also - you can sell them in far away<br/>
places to casters who are looking for ac.  I sold a set this weekend for<br/>
15pp - some guy was auctioning for boots and I sold him mine.<br/>

		Hail all,<br/>
		Well, just made 20th level over the weekend (and as a result<br/>
of my recent,<br/>
		now ending, unemployment :o).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		At this level the healing song is still useless in the fight<br/>
correct? Any<br/>
		thing I am missing?<br/>
<br/>
		Bronze boots (which HAVE to go, they are way to heavy, but I<br/>
haven&#39;t found a<br/>
		good replacement yet)</div>
