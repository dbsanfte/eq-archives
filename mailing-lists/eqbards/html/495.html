 </span></blockquote>Sorry, but running around &#39;naked&#39; as you are, you really can&#39;t do<br/>
both.  For money, I&#39;d start with fishing.  Easy, low risk, and SLOW!<br/>
<br/>
Then the next step is to find a weapon, any weapon, and some armour,<br/>
any armour.  I&#39;d recommend finding a nice decaying skeleton with a<br/>
weapon, and a friendly tailor.  I know that I sew for free given<br/>
the raw materials.<br/>
<br/>
Once you are armoured and weaponed, you can start to hunt the things<br/>
you used to, but carefully.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t mention what level you are, so the above advice is pretty<br/>
generic.  I used this tactic when my corpse was lost, at about level<br/>
9.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, friends who are relatively well off may offer to loan you<br/>
reasonable sums of money, which will help you get back to where you<br/>
were before much quicker.<br/>
