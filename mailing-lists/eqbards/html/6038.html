<div id="ygrps-yiv-948296023">I had a disturbing situation happen the other day.  I was sharing the<br/>
sisters bandit camp in Lesser fay with a group of 3 others.  All of the<br/>
other players were 15-16 level and in a group, and consisted of a Ranger,<br/>
Bard, and a Magician.  At the time I was 15th level and am quite capable of<br/>
soloing the camp while alone, so I wasen&#39;t milking off them.  We had a good<br/>
thing going and were being very friendly to one another untill something odd<br/>
happend.<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting for my spawn, when I heared the sounds of battle behind me.  I<br/>
figured that they were killing a giant spider or somthing in between spawns<br/>
as I often do.  But something didn&#39;t sound right.  I turned around to see<br/>
the 16th level Bard and the 15th level Ranger, attacking a named Brownie.<br/>
My jaw dropped as I asessed the situation.  The brownie was hardly hit at<br/>
all and the two where below half health already.  Now was my time for snap<br/>
deciscions.  Should I help out, or should I bug out.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew that they would die if they stayed, but I thought that the 16th bard<br/>
would kick in Selo&#39;s and run for the zone pulling the little nasty with him<br/>
and saving the party.  Thats what I would do.  Well I waited and the spell<br/>
caster managed to get off some big spells taking its health down about a<br/>
quarter, just as the Bard and the Ranger dropped.  By this time I had my<br/>
drum in hand and Selo&#39;s playing, I whacked the Brownie and headed for the<br/>
Greater Fay zone.  Much to my surprise, I could not out-run him by much, and<br/>
he stayed on my tail all the way to the zone, where I got out with a sliver<br/>
of life.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m feeling pretty good at this point, because I managed to save the<br/>
Spell Caster.  But as I&#39;m healing in the entrance to the lesser fay, the<br/>
Bard who died came up and started bitching me out for not helping.  I told<br/>
him that he was dead from the first hit, and asked him why he did not Selo<br/>
out for the zone with his party, but that just made him more mad.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up stopping for the night to try think of anything I could have done<br/>
better, it all happend so fast.  Any suggestions?<br/>
