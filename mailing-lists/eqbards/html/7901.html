is KOS if you stand next to them too long or they see you<br/>
fighting (say, gators or spiders).  However, killing undead<br/>
froggies raises your faction with the live ones.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s on the undead froglok side.  Good faction with the live<br/>
frogs will do nothing for you there.  We had two parties<br/>
heading towards the spot together (10 people total, levels 30<br/>
to 42) and unfortunately got a train run through us.  It<br/>
passed completely through us, but we knew it was coming back<br/>
when the people conducting the train either died or zoned, and<br/>
frantically started to invis-to-undead everyone.  We didn&#39;t<br/>
finish it in time.  One of us got attacked, after which people<br/>
dropped their invisibility to defend him, and all hell broke<br/>
loose.  Only 3 of us made it out alive.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun.  :-)<br/>
