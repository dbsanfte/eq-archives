<div id="ygrps-yiv-343119812">This was when a) Venril was killable or b) when just about anything could drop off of anything in karnors<br/>
- pre-karnors nerf.<br/>
Either way thats irrelevant because the helm, arms, and bracers which should be dropping in Sebilis are<br/>
not. Not one of those pieces, anywhere, on anyone whereas each of the other classes with Kunark armor have<br/>
at least 1 piece from Sebilis found.<br/>

&gt; &gt;so far the only pieces found are gloves, boots, and legs.  there is only<br/>
&gt; &gt;one<br/>
&gt; &gt;set of legs (on any server) because we were able to kill venril sathir<br/>
&gt; &gt;before he was buffed incredibly (apparently he is a quest npc and not to be<br/>
&gt; &gt;killed), and now his loot table is most likely empty.  so we have gloves<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;boots.  every other class with kunark armor has found one or all of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;following, and this includes druid, ranger, shadow knight, paladin,<br/>
&gt; &gt;warrior,<br/>
&gt; &gt;rogue, shaman, cleric: arms, helm, bracer.  none of these have been found<br/>
&gt; &gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt;singing steel.  i refuse to believe they have not been found yet.  every<br/>
&gt; &gt;other class with armor in kunark has found these pieces!  maybe bards get<br/>
&gt; &gt;lucky and our pieces are so incredible they are found only in veeshan&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;peak<br/>
&gt; &gt;(laugh).  so what i think is that once again, like imbrued armor in hate,<br/>
&gt; &gt;bard armor has been forgotten to be placed in kunark.  anyone who is more<br/>
&gt; &gt;familiar and versed want to ask on the gameplay forum?  or am i wrong?<br/>
