&gt; accidentally mesmerizes himself.  It&#39;s funny because sometimes he&#39;ll just<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can type just fine while mesmerized.  You can&#39;t type while<br/>
charmed.  And I&#39;ve done it to myself with both mesmerize and<br/>
Pixie Strike (both targeted).  If you accidently hit the tab<br/>
key before hitting the spell/song button, you end up<br/>
targetting yourself.<br/>
