<div id="ygrps-yiv-152123851">It definately matters.  Anytime you ever give anything at all to an NPC, and<br/>
that item is stackable, you should split them up into separate &quot;boxes&quot;.  Just<br/>
like making things with trade skills, EQ register&#39;s stacked items in a trade<br/>
(or a combiner) as a single item, so in this case, you&#39;d lose a ruby (and that<br/>
would suck).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>example if i want a Lambent star ruby i must give the NPC ( can&#39;t recall the<br/>
name ) 2 star ruby&#39;s and a lambent stone. So my question is , do i give the<br/>
rubies to him/her stacked ( only taking up 1 trade box ) or seperate ( using<br/>
2) ? Or does it even matter ? I just really have zero interest in screwing<br/>
this up , any and all opinions are welcome .<br/>
