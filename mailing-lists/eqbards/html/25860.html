<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023385532">A macro cannot adjust to a missed note, and becomes a liability in the case<br/>
of repeated missed notes.  I tried it, a while back.  You can&#39;t pick up<br/>
where you missed a note.  The social has to start at the beginning again,<br/>
once you manage to stop it, and start it again.<br/>
<br/>
A macro also cannot change the math (since you like math) involved, in cast<br/>
times, and duration times.  While I haven&#39;t sat down and formulated all the<br/>
possible combinations (I&#39;d rather spend what little free time I get playing<br/>
the game), I&#39;m relatively certain that there is no combination of songs that<br/>
allows for a true, no dropped effects, 5 song twist.  You will get dropped<br/>
effects, and, in my opinion, any &quot;twist&quot; that inherently drops effects, is<br/>
no twist at all.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to continue to disagree, however, you can&#39;t change the fact that,<br/>
if dropped effects don&#39;t matter, then we can all twist 8 songs effortlessly.<br/>

social button) would eliminate most of the complaints you have with twisting<br/>
four.<br/>
