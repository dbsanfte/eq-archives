<div id="ygrps-yiv-59813647">No, that would be true if I chose not to be a pitcher because I wanted to be<br/>
a shortstop.  The people analogous to me not choosing to play baseball are<br/>
the people who choose not to play EQ at all but play MW4 instead or bowling<br/>
for that matter.<br/>

ok, so there&#39;s one other possibility i guess which is &#39;&#39;just don&#39;t like<br/>
it&#39;&#39;, but that<br/>
has nothing to do with relative power between classes.  this is a perfect<br/>
example.<br/>
you could have had huge financial rewards (i know, it&#39;s still a small chance<br/>
due to<br/>
all the things you mentioned) but you didn&#39;t like it and chose to do<br/>
something different.<br/>
<br/>
this illustrates my view that choices aren&#39;t made only looking at reward<br/>
given to work output,<br/>
which invalidates your argument that bards must be underpowered because they<br/>
are<br/>
underrepresented.<br/>

&gt;Not really.  Just because not everyone choose to play the class doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;prove that not everyone can play the class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is arrogant to assume that everyone who chooses not to play pro baseball<br/>
&gt;does so because they cannot.  Undoubtedly there are many who could, but<br/>
&gt;instead play pro football, basketball, soccer, etc.  There are far more<br/>
&gt;reasons as well.  It was amusing you chose this analogy to me.  I probably<br/>
&gt;could have played pro baseball, in high school I could already throw an 85<br/>
&gt;mph fastball.  In my senior year I quit playing though because I found<br/>
&gt;baseball boring.  Too much standing around, and not enough brain usage.<br/>
&gt;True I probably could have made millions, if I didn&#39;t blow my arm out<br/>
&gt;trying, if the pressure didn&#39;t overwhelm me, if...  You get the picture.<br/>
&gt;The number of baseball players, or football players, or musicians, or<br/>
&gt;actors, who make millions a year is roughly the same proportion to those<br/>
