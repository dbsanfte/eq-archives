<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074001672">This was written by one of my guildmates and posted on our guild&#39;s board...<br/>
quite clever... read on and see:<br/>
<br/>
A number of guilds are planning on joining forces to perform an<br/>
unprecedented sneak attack on the new North Pole Zone and the even deeper<br/>
zone : Santa&#39;s Workshop. The participants wish to keep their names and the<br/>
names of their guilds anonymous due to ramifications of killing the Jolly<br/>
Old Elf rumored to spawn in those zones. Who would want to kill such a well<br/>
known character who is known to give out gifts to all the newbies in<br/>
Norrath?<br/>
<br/>
Truly a rare spawn, Ol&#39; Saint Nick, as he&#39;s called, only spawns once in<br/>
every 365 days. Typically, he kindly considers everybody regardless of class<br/>
and race. Unfortunately rumors have formed about some truly magnificent loot<br/>
the elf dressed in red may be carrying and who wouldn&#39;t mind a small faction<br/>
hit for some good loot. A red cloak which can shrink the person wearing it<br/>
so they can fit even in places as small as a chimney! A large bag with<br/>
unlimited slots which reduces the weight of everything in it to zero! Boots<br/>
which allow the wearer to teleport anywhere in the world! Black gloves which<br/>
allow the wearer to slow down time! All of the wearable items offer a<br/>
substantial increase to cold resistance as well! I&#39;m almost tempted to sign<br/>
up for this raid myself!<br/>
<br/>
No one has heard of any weapons the elf might be carrying but he is usually<br/>
accompanied by 8 horned creatures with incredible piercing abilities and who<br/>
can run at speeds on par with Spirit of Cheetah. Occasionally a ninth horned<br/>
mob will accompany the elf. This other mob has a nose of fire. It is<br/>
believed he drop the &#39;Globe of Fire&#39; which has unlimited charges of immolate<br/>
and is usable in the off-hand!<br/>
<br/>
What a Christmas this may turn out to be!<br/>
