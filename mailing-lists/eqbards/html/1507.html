&gt; Was this change even implemented on the test server yet? If so, does<br/>
&gt; anyone play on the test server? I am curious to find out what songs<br/>
&gt; they would make require mana.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went onto the test server this morning, and none of the songs in the three<br/>
main bard guilds required mana, though all had &quot;Mana cost: 0&quot; listed on them<br/>
(can&#39;t remember if that was there before or not).<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t not have a chance to check Highpass or Erudin.<br/>
<br/>
Any information on this somwhat alarming development is appreciated :)<br/>
