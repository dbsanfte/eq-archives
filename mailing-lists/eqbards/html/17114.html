<div id="ygrps-yiv-957339407">well first couple times i went on nag raid, naggy was easy.  this last time<br/>
he handed our arses back to us.  (had about 40+ ppl, usual number)<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s been debated and a large part of our failure may be so few people were<br/>
feared this time.  with one massive wall of people staying in naggy&#39;s breath<br/>
radius, everyone dropped at once instead of the recurring waves you get when<br/>
a large number are feared.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] dragons easier?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I apologize, this is kinda off topic, but a question for some of the high<br/>
&gt; level bards.<br/>
&gt; Do dragons seem any easier to you guys?  We killed Vox last night<br/>
&gt; with 30ish<br/>
&gt; people.  2 clerics, 1 bard, nobody died.  Last time we killed her we also<br/>
&gt; had no deaths.  Nags was almost as easy.<br/>
&gt; My guild is a great bunch of people, but I have trouble believing<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re that<br/>
&gt; good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else have an easier than normal time?  Possible dragon nerf?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
