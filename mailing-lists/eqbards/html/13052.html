<b>Subject:</b> Maestro&#39;s Lute effectiveness. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-276788415">At level 50, a lute heals 18 points alone.<br/>
Standing (at any level) regens for a total of 1 hp per tick.<br/>
Sitting at lvl 50 (and only at level 50 I believe) regens for a total of 4 hp a tick.<br/>
So, standing while play Hymn = 19 hp a tick, and sitting = 22, not 21.<br/>
If the Maestro&#39;s lute is 25 while sitting, subtract the 4 from natural regen to get 21. Which is +3 from a<br/>
normal lute. 3/18 is about 16.666...%. So the lute increases stringed songs effects by roughly +16 - +17%.<br/>
