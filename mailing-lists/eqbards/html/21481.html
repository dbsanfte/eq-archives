&gt; &gt; Well since we are the Jack of All Trades (Master of None) I just take <br/>
&gt; it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; stride. Besides, there aren&#39;t all that many enchanters around, and when<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are, the enchanters are always happy to have me in the group with <br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As always, it depends on the situation. Sometimes a bard might be better,<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes a specific class would be better. Besides, if you&#39;re grouped <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; a bunch of jerks who boot you from a group, simply because they want one<br/>
&gt; &gt; class over another, I&#39;d be only too happy not to be with a them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think you are misreading what he said and allowing your emotional<br/>
&gt;attachment to your character cloud your vision of the bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt;effectiveness. He didn&#39;t mean a bard would be kicked from a group to<br/>
&gt;make room for an enchanter. In the high level game that doesn&#39;t happen<br/>
&gt;because groups don&#39;t form unless they have an enchanter anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to enchanters being happy to have you in the group, every caster<br/>
&gt;loves the mana song just like every caster loves clarity. Some of us<br/>
&gt;aspired to being a little more than a mana pump when we reached the<br/>
&gt;pinnacle of our class at higher levels. With the latest patch you can<br/>
&gt;now add ineffective haste to our ineffective crowd control in our list<br/>
&gt;of defining abilities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, must have misinterpreted. My understanding is that he was unhappy <br/>
with the fact that our speed buffing song has been nerfed, and that a group <br/>
would choose an enchanter over a bard because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Your perspective sounds like it&#39;s applicable to only high level bards <br/>
however. I&#39;m a upper-mid level bard (39) and can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen what <br/>
you&#39;re saying happens. I&#39;ve been in lots of groups without enchanters. In <br/>
fact, it&#39;s rare that I run across an enchanter, and at my level I can still <br/>
do crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
Any other low-mid level bards have an opinion?</div>
