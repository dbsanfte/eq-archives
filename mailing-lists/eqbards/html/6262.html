<br/>
that is what the planes are for.  when Fear was open (yes it is open now but<br/>
impossible for 40 level 50s) a large majority of 45+ characters was there<br/>
for most of their time, thus freeing up space for spots where they would<br/>
normally take away from the rest of the 40-50 characters.  it got us out of<br/>
your way.  it also kept me from creating new characters and going after<br/>
items for them (so sue me).  before they patched Fear and made it<br/>
impossible, i had no other characters.  now i have two.  like you said, the<br/>
vast majority of players are not 50, and consequently the vast majority of<br/>
zones are not for level 50 players.  as of now, there are really only 2<br/>
zones, which i mentioned: Solusek B and Lower Guk.  more zones for us is the<br/>
answer, not retirement.  thanks for wanting to get rid of me though =P<br/>

&gt; I guess I really don&#39;t understand this.  Maybe I&#39;m incorrect <br/>
&gt; in assuming<br/>
&gt; that the whole point of EverQuest is the experience of <br/>
&gt; getting to level 50.<br/>
&gt;  There may be a few challenges left at level 50, but that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not really what<br/>
&gt; the game is all about.  Once you reach 50, I don&#39;t really see <br/>
&gt; the point.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;ve won, essentially.  You&#39;ve become a demi-god, or <br/>
&gt; whatever.  If it was<br/>
&gt; a single player game, it would be over.  Why should Verant <br/>
&gt; have to generate<br/>
&gt; content for those that have maximized their characters, beyond the few<br/>
&gt; really tough encounters that should be the ultimate victories for said<br/>
&gt; characters?  Once you&#39;ve killed Nafagen, or Lady Vox, or <br/>
&gt; other Uber-mob,<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t it be time to retire?  Obviously this stance would cause the<br/>
&gt; level 50 people to stop playing, and move on to other games, <br/>
&gt; but I think<br/>
&gt; that this is how it should be (unless they want to play as a different<br/>
&gt; character).  The VAST majority of players still haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; reached 50, and<br/>
&gt; most aren&#39;t even close.  Verant can&#39;t make the game revolve around<br/>
&gt; powergamers, because they would never be able to keep up.  In <br/>
&gt; fact, I&#39;m for<br/>
&gt; putting level 50 characters into forced retirement until the expansion<br/>
&gt; pack.  That way we could get rid of all this farming for <br/>
&gt; guilds, and for<br/>
&gt; other twinked characters.  Plus we&#39;d stop distracting the <br/>
&gt; developers from<br/>
&gt; fixing the real problems with the game.  In my opinion, lack <br/>
&gt; of things for<br/>
&gt; level 50 players to do is not an important problem in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>
