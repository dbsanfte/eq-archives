<div id="ygrps-yiv-800642743">Sometimes I wonder if Verant even reads the messages players send in.  I<br/>
think every player in EQ knows that mobs higher level than you have a better<br/>
chance at resisting spell/song effects compared to mobs lower level than<br/>
you.  No where in Jason&#39;s letter did he mention his tests were against<br/>
higher level mobs.  At least he did say the testing department is checking<br/>
it out.  <br/>

bad as we think it is)<br/>

&gt; Yesterday I wrote an email to Geoffrey Zatkin regarding Lullaby and Pixie<br/>
&gt; Strike and received a brief reply.  I&#39;ll post the Arch Mage&#39;s replay<br/>
&gt; first,<br/>
&gt; since I know it&#39;s what everyone wants to see.  My email to him follows.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sidebar:<br/>
&gt; Zatkin&#39;s computer date is at least one day ahead, as I received the email<br/>
&gt; from him on Friday (10.12.99) morning after having sent my mail on<br/>
&gt; Thursday<br/>
&gt; (9.12.99) afternoon.  The time is likely correct at 9:32pm as I had<br/>
&gt; checked<br/>
&gt; my email as late as 7:00pm on Thursday.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have our testing department checking this out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Be aware, however, that higher level creatures save<br/>
&gt; &gt; better against these spells then lower level ones do.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr. Zatkin,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for a wonderful game.  As a 35 year old professional programmer<br/>
&gt; myself, I have a very good idea of what it takes to design and complete an<br/>
&gt; effort as massive as EverQuest.  Verant has done an outstanding job.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there someone at Verant in Testing/QA/QC that would be more appropriate<br/>
&gt; to send email to regarding testing the subtleties of Bard songs?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jason Farque&#39;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In recent email communications between you and another Bardic player, you<br/>
&gt; indicated that there have been no changes to the level 15 Bard song<br/>
&gt; &quot;Kelin&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Lucid Lullaby&quot;.  As a 37th level Bard with a great deal of experience with<br/>
&gt; this song I can assure you that its behavior has changed.  The change in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; song has been felt by Bards at all levels, it&#39;s not merely my personal<br/>
&gt; perception of the song&#39;s having changed for me over time.  In fact the<br/>
&gt; same<br/>
&gt; behavioral changes have effected the level 28 song &quot;Crission&#39;s Pixie<br/>
&gt; Strike&quot;.  The changes feel unintentional, as the success/resist messages<br/>
&gt; that we receive no longer correctly correspond to mob behavior as they<br/>
&gt; used<br/>
&gt; to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I explain the behavior of Pixie Strike first as it&#39;s easier to explain and<br/>
&gt; to test.  Lullaby&#39;s behavior is the same, except for a radius and multiple<br/>
&gt; mobs:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PIXIE STRIKE:<br/>
&gt; Very often if you attempt to mesmerize a mob with Pixie Strike you will<br/>
&gt; receive a blue &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; message indicating a success, and yet the<br/>
&gt; mob will attack in its next round as though it resisted.  Repeatedly<br/>
&gt; successfully Pixie Striking a mob will increase the chances of the song<br/>
&gt; &quot;taking hold&quot;.  After some 3-5 successful Pixie Strikes, the mob will in<br/>
&gt; fact be mezzed.  After a single successful mez, mob behavior begins to<br/>
&gt; correctly correspond to the success/resist messages that you receive.  One<br/>
&gt; way to test this song would be to buff yourself to level 30 or so and<br/>
&gt; attempt to mez a blue mob in Runnyeye, Sol A or Unrest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LULLABY:<br/>
&gt; Using Lullaby against very low level mobs such as can be found in newbie<br/>
&gt; zones or BlackBurrow this song will successfully &quot;nod&quot; many or all mobs in<br/>
&gt; its radius.  A very large percentage of those mobs will attack in their<br/>
&gt; next<br/>
&gt; round despite zero resist messages.  Iteratively applying this song to the<br/>
&gt; same mobs yields increasingly &quot;correct&quot; results.  In other words if I play<br/>
&gt; the song for 8 mobs, all 8 might &quot;nod&quot; without resist messages but 5 will,<br/>
&gt; in their next round, turn to me and deliver attacks as though they<br/>
&gt; resisted.<br/>
&gt; The next pulse of the song might &quot;nod&quot; all mobs again, but only 3 will<br/>
&gt; deliver attacks in their next round, etc.  Using this song as we did<br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; it changed (similarly to the way an Enchanter might use Mesmerization) is<br/>
&gt; impossible, as the Bard is placed high on the aggro list of the unoccupied<br/>
&gt; mobs, and yet they are not &quot;mezzed&quot; despite success messages.  This new<br/>
&gt; behavior of lullaby generally leads to swift death at the hands of<br/>
&gt; multiple<br/>
&gt; mobs, so very few of the highly competent bards that I know and converse<br/>
&gt; with in-game and via the &quot;eqbards&quot; email list at onelist.com even attempt<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; use this song any longer.  One way to test this song would be to buff<br/>
&gt; yourself to level 25 or so and play it for the green mobs in Kerra Isle or<br/>
&gt; Blackburrow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you sincerely for your time and the great game.  If I can be of<br/>
&gt; further assistance please let me know.<br/>
