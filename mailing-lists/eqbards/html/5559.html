<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440789370">To add my opinion to an extremely old topic, in general conversation I<br/>
refer to the act of keeping multiple song effects active simultaneously as<br/>
weaving.  However, I would love to use the terms once mentioned here of<br/>
&#39;doublestop&#39; and &#39;triplestop&#39; and the like (by far the most appropriate),<br/>
if doing so wouldn&#39;t immediately prompt confused questions.<br/>
<br/>
Which leads to, you know you&#39;re addicted to EverQuest when you sing the<br/>
first three measures of five different songs over and over and over.<br/>

locomotive runs by, &#39;Choo-choo!&#39;</div>
