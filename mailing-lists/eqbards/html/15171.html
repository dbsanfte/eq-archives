&gt;&gt; *sigh* I play an enchanter too. Before they start giving bard the ability<br/>
&gt;&gt; to make enchanted items, why don&#39;t they implement what they<br/>
&gt;promised to do<br/>
&gt;&gt; for enchanters in doing the same first?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We even have Viscuous Mana, etc now that seems to imply they would be<br/>
&gt;&gt; working on more. And... nothing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe they&#39;re trying to figure out a way to not have the trade skill<br/>
&gt;completely monopolized by enchanters like jewellry currently is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is?<br/>
<br/>
The first jeweler I ever knew was a wizard. A cleric in our guild is<br/>
currently<br/>
also a Master in jewelrycraft. In fact, I know more enchanters that have<br/>
left jewelry than that are IN it. And quite a few non-enchanters that craft<br/>
and not only actively craft, but enjoy it.</div>
