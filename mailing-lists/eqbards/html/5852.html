&gt; I had problems a long time ago as well,but recently it has been absolutely<br/>
&gt; 100% reliable. The only time I EVER became visible was if I had a connection<br/>
&gt; hiccup, like near linkdeadness. Then I would see the icon disappear and have<br/>
&gt; about 4 seconds to start running before the smackdown started. Otherwise it<br/>
&gt; always works.<br/>
<br/>

into visibility message while the icon has still been solidly in place. <br/>
