&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well the catch is that using a gamepad *might* be considered <br/>
&gt; a violation of<br/>
&gt; the TOS -- from all the &quot;official&quot; comments, it seems that VI <br/>
&gt; views gamepads<br/>
&gt; as &quot;macroing&quot;.  Taking that into consideration, they also <br/>
&gt; have backed off<br/>
&gt; that stance somewhat since using a gamepad to twist songs <br/>
&gt; (and it is NOT<br/>
&gt; reliable in a battle due to missed notes, lag etc.) can offer <br/>
&gt; relief to<br/>
&gt; someone who is suffering from a physical disability, a <br/>
&gt; repetitive stress<br/>
&gt; condition etc..  I think the best guideline to go by is to <br/>
&gt; NEVER leave your<br/>
&gt; gamepad alone with a repetive &quot;macro&quot; going when you are not at the<br/>
&gt; keyboard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I personally use a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro, which has <br/>
&gt; software that allows<br/>
&gt; you to program in extremely long series of keystrokes (my <br/>
&gt; heal&#92;mana sequence<br/>
&gt; lasts 10 minutes and my levitate&#92;selos sequence lasts 20 <br/>
&gt; minutes).  Other<br/>
&gt; gamepads allow programming keystrokes and also have an <br/>
&gt; auto-fire button,<br/>
&gt; which would be better suited to this application.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The big thing about using a gamepad to twist is you have to <br/>
&gt; stop it from<br/>
&gt; twisting to say anything. Also if you are using it for <br/>
&gt; travel, and you miss<br/>
&gt; a couple notes in a row trying to play levitation, well lets <br/>
&gt; just say its<br/>
&gt; not the fall that kills you - its the sudden stop.<br/>
