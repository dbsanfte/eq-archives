<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999332760">Well,<br/>
<br/>
I got my bard to 20th level...<br/>
I played 20th level for about 6 weeks ( a couple of hours a night).  Every<br/>
death cost me about a week of play time.<br/>
One group I was in, let me die 3 times, with no one else near death (2<br/>
clerics!), so i bailed.  I&#39;ve nearly lost 20th, now,<br/>
and have pretty much retired my bard.  (Who ever said 20 wasn&#39;t a hell<br/>
level???).  I&#39;m playing my DE Enchanter now (up to 9th level)<br/>
Leveling the enchanter is much easier than it was with the bard.<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE to continue playing my bard, but I can&#39;t figure out how to get<br/>
experience, and keep it, especially in pick-up groups.  Unfortunately, most<br/>
of my guild has surpassed me in levels, and I no longer get xp if I group<br/>
with them.  I would love to power-level up to around 25 or so, and join my<br/>
guildmates, but I have been unable to find anyplace that is not camped to<br/>
the hilt on Solusek Ro.  The aviaks are consistently camped, both in South<br/>
Karana and Lake Rathe.  Solusek A is a death trap.  Likewise, with Unrest<br/>
and the Cauldron.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone out there has some novel ideas on how to find stuff to solo power<br/>
level with, I would love to hear it.   But, for now, MacGrough is retired<br/>
(sitting in ButcherBlock after 2 deaths in Cauldron).<br/>

&gt; Couple of people have posted and been struggling during the same levels I<br/>
&gt; had difficulty with the first time around, so I thought I&#39;d drop a few<br/>
tips<br/>
&gt; on how and why you should peserve (its amazing what you see in hindsight):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The general concensus is that the time from 19th to 26th is quite<br/>
&gt; fustrating; you&#39;re at the point were the disparity between your melee and<br/>
&gt; your tank friends melee prowess begins to show, and yet your songs don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; adiquately compensate for that lost.  Its difficult to find a good group<br/>
&gt; during this time because this is also the weed out period - worse that<br/>
hell<br/>
&gt; levels, the 20&#39;s test your commitiment to that class in my opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At anyrate, your position is clear (push past these levels as quickly as<br/>
&gt; possible) and while boring, doing the noterious deepwater goblin pets of<br/>
&gt; Lake Rathetear will get you though it, and will get you out of your rut.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; just checked today as I sold at the ogre camp, 2 pets still run by every 2<br/>
&gt; mins.  As someone here stated before [referring to hell levels], &#39;Quantity<br/>
&gt; over quailty.&quot;  Just set up camp right near the ogres on the hill if<br/>
you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; solo, or right at the tree in the gut if you&#39;re in a group and go to work.<br/>
&gt; You have a convient zone line if something goes wrong and a food and water<br/>
&gt; vendor literally next door.  You can kill the bandits on the other side of<br/>
&gt; the gut handily for lunch money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trust me, stay on it, you&#39;ll get through it in about a week with modest<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; time doing the pets and then suddenly your 20&#39;s songs, powered by your new<br/>
&gt; higher levels, will be more effective and desired in a group (for the<br/>
&gt; record, besides selo&#39;s, the song I ALWAYS have mem&#39;d: chain, even if I<br/>
&gt; grouped with 3 rangers and 2 druids you couldn&#39;t pay me to forget the<br/>
song.<br/>
&gt; Just like insurance, ya hope you never have to use it but you don&#39;t leave<br/>
&gt; home without it.).  I suppose there is an argument to go through these<br/>
&gt; levels the traditional way, but I did that the first time around -- it was<br/>
&gt; painful and in the end the only valuable lesson/tactic/govering principle<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; drew from the experience was &quot;Ain&#39;t doing that again!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have fun and good luck,<br/>
