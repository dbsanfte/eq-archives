&gt; (I&#39;m 17, and not really into economics, or buisiness, so the following is<br/>
&gt; all limited speculation on my behalf.  Read at your own discretion, and<br/>
&gt; correct me if you may.  Friendly opinions welcomed too.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
You&#39;re a paying customer - your opinions are as valid as any.  Regardless,<br/>
you sound pretty bright for a 17-year old...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well, personally I feel that we may be demanding too much out of the<br/>
company<br/>
&gt; right now.  Yes, it was realeased as only a portion of what it SHOULD be,<br/>
&gt; but the entire process...hiring all the help, setting up servers, beta<br/>
&gt; testing, and everything else, must have cost a FORTUNE compared to what<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; average game would cost to produce  (Avg game = Anything not promising<br/>
lots<br/>
&gt; of future patches or an evolving world, etc.).<br/>
&gt; For ANY company, even a subdivision of the super-rich Sony Corp, to invest<br/>
&gt; enough time and cash into a game like this to get rid of ALL significant<br/>
&gt; bugs etc. would be an incredible risk for the company.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, it took god 6 days to create the world...and on the seventh day he<br/>
&gt; rested.  Give Brad and the team a break, they are only humans...humans<br/>
under<br/>
&gt; the confines of a Sony controlled company, which does have to be careful<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; they invest their money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Agreed.  This is a big undertaking.  If you notice - they were more careful<br/>
about their marketing claims than Origin was with Ultima Online.  I don&#39;t<br/>
recall ever seeing claims that the world would be up 24x7 as did Origin.  To<br/>
expect any piece of software to be completely bug-free is unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The only thing that bugs me is that an expansion was already hinted at<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; in the works by a Verant employee, and they still have bards strumming a<br/>
&gt; stick when playing the drums.  Don&#39;t even get me started on the other<br/>
holes,<br/>
&gt; you all know what I&#39;m talking about.  If they ARE building an expansion<br/>
now,<br/>
&gt; I would stop playing immediatly.  A company that would think of money from<br/>
&gt; an expansion before bringing quality promised to an existing product has<br/>
its<br/>
&gt; priorities WAY off base.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Agreed - but all I&#39;ve seen so far is talk of an expansion.  There is no<br/>
evidence that this is actually in the works.  The proof is in the pudding to<br/>
coin a cliche.  Are new servers not being put up?  Are bugs not being<br/>
addressed?  In my opinion, Sony/Verant&#39;s record is damned good.  They got<br/>
the initial server problem worked out pretty quick - and didn&#39;t charge us<br/>
for those two weeks.  The biggest nastiest corpse bug they fixed pretty<br/>
quick.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Heres why I think they are working on expansions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;How much? I can&#39;t get into anything like that because we haven&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; really officially announced anything about expansions.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was said by Brad McQuaid in response to questions concerning the<br/>
price<br/>
&gt; of future expansions.  It definately hints at something going on, but of<br/>
&gt; course there are no official announcements yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;There will be announcements soon about what to expect (well, more like<br/>
&gt; teasers). I really do wish I could tell you more, because there&#39;s some<br/>
&gt; really cool stuff, but I am not the keeper of PR.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was said by Rick Schmitz, artist at Verant, in response to the<br/>
question<br/>
&gt; of the possability of an expansion.  It definately hints at it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh well, I&#39;ll deal with it when the official announcements are made.<br/>
Expect<br/>
&gt; cussing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All products are based on a business model.  I&#39;m not privy to exactly how<br/>
this works - but I am guessing the $10/month is providing them with a lot of<br/>
profit.  I&#39;m guessing that the biggest bang for the buck, economically<br/>
speaking is the ~$50 we shelled out for the game.  To maintain the profit<br/>
margins necessary to keep a company like Sony funding the product - they are<br/>
going to have to get us to shell that out again.  Particularly when they<br/>
have more competition (Asheron&#39;s Call, Middle-Earth), etc<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is this - if they spend reasonable resources fixing bugs,<br/>
building enough servers, having sufficient GM&#39;s online, tweaking the game so<br/>
that spawn rates aren&#39;t too small (or too great - I recall early UOL days<br/>
everyone getting wiped out because the game was overrun with tough<br/>
monsters) - who cares how many more programmers they are paying to build an<br/>
expansion?<br/>
