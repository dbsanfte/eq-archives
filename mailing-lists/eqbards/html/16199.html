&gt; Wait! I know what it was Sylly!  It&#39;s the evil Verant anit-camp code.  The<br/>

during normal play and right after a missed note.  My<br/>
subjective feeling is that there&#39;s a much higher chance of<br/>
getting a second missed note right after you&#39;ve already missed<br/>
one.  The random number generator really does seem to be<br/>
screwy that way.  We got two 2h-mithril swords off successive<br/>
king spawns (i.e. no placeholder in between), and the next day<br/>
we got 2 ghoulbanes of successive shin lord spawns (that one<br/>
was at 4am and I specifically asked everyone to stick around<br/>
just in case the RNG burped, which it did).<br/>
