giants in rathe, do it 8)<br/>

Those 5 bards joking around that you should quit now are deep down giving<br/>
your cries for help. Someone posted a link on concert hall for a proggie<br/>
that lets you macro in eq using a MS sidewinder, i gotta check it out soon,<br/>
my joystick is getting pretty dusty. Might want to suggest that to them,<br/>
supposedly you can type while its macroing (example: heal/mana in downtime)<br/>
so that means you just twist during fights and stuff, not in downtimes<br/>

Paradigm has 5 bards I believe, all 55+ and of course they all rock :)<br/>
<br/>
However, every one of them laughs at me for playing Tani.  The other day, I<br/>
told one &quot;Hey, I just learned something about Bard-dom&quot;.. she replies,<br/>
&quot;What? That you should quit now?&quot; Found it kind of funny... but seriously,<br/>
they mostly complain aobut their hands being tired from twisting hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Halana, 56th eternally (damn these quests) Shaman<br/>
Tani, 29th Bardette<br/>

&gt; 3 50+ active bards: Me, just made 54.  Suladan 55 still plays his bard<br/>
&gt; pretty much.  Kaldivar 53 not really enjoying high level life <br/>
&gt; (hard to get<br/>
&gt; good groups, exp so slow, etc. etc.) so he has been leveling <br/>
&gt; up a warrior<br/>
&gt; and playing other classes.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lately, I have been playing 52 Cleric and 51 Enchanter.  <br/>
&gt; Learning these<br/>
&gt; other classes is more interesting to me at the moment.  Also, <br/>
&gt; I have 2 PC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; now and spend a fair amount of time driving 2 chars.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just a quick question. How many bards above 30 are there in <br/>
&gt; your guilds?<br/>
