<b>Subject:</b> Encumberance, possible anti-twink code? <br/>

&gt; Astute observation John.  It has me wondering now, what is your agi then?<br/>
&gt; I still seem to be okay even with almost a full set of bronze (minus<br/>
&gt; gloves and mask).  However I haven&#39;t noticed being hit much more than I<br/>
&gt; did before, perhaps a higher AGI helps compensate for being really close<br/>
&gt; to your max weight allowance.  Just for reference my AGI is 100 base and<br/>
&gt; 102 at the moment with the aid of an earring.  The other thing that I can<br/>
&gt; admit is the fact that I rarely dodge in combat.  So it appears that<br/>
&gt; encumberance plays a role with it.  I have 84 STR with all bonuses.  With<br/>
&gt; my armor, weapons and supplies I weigh in at 79.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Ever since I moved to bronze plate (slowly switching it with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;steel plate), I get the impression that mobs get an attack<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bonus if you are close to encumbered but not there yet.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;regularly being hit for close to max damage, while my lower<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;level friends in banded seem to be taking less.  The only one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;who seems to take more is my monk friend, who is 6 levels<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;behind me and has woven/mesh (leather/chain equivalent for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;damage absorbtion).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Could this be the working of the anti-twink code? Maybe it truly<br/>
takes levels (and thus more defense skill) to use heavier armors<br/>
properly. I also had the impression that when I switched to banded<br/>
now, at lvl10, I got hit harder a bit. Of course, people get heavier<br/>
armor for themselves without any aid from others too, but maybe<br/>
it does not pay to be fit in the best you can afford, but in the best<br/>
you can use =)<br/>
