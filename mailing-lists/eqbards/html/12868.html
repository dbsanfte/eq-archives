<b>Subject:</b> Sitting down during a dragon raid <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224866518">Spoke with a couple of veterans of dragon raids and they told me that if you<br/>
are sitting down and fail a resist check against dragon fear, you will stand<br/>
up and start fleeing.  Apparently this was not always the case.  From what I<br/>
was told, prior to dragon raids becoming common events, the game code<br/>
allowed people sit down while fleeing.  This allowed players to avoid the<br/>
danger of fleeing via an exploit.  Once Verant saw what players were doing<br/>
they fixed it in a patch (a good move IMO).  <br/>
<br/>
Had the strategy worked, it shouldn&#39;t have been that hard to twist songs<br/>
even while sitting.  All you had to do was stand up, switch songs, then sit<br/>
back down.  This would have worked assuming dragon fear isn&#39;t a continuous<br/>
effect.  All you would have to do is synchronize standing up right after the<br/>
dragon fear spell went off.  <br/>
<br/>
All a moot point now.  Just have to be patient and wait until I&#39;m in the 40s<br/>
before I go on a raid.<br/>

PS Still a possible workaround but probably not worth the effort, especially<br/>
if a high level bard is available to go on the raid.  What a lower level<br/>
bard could do is /duel a 50 level player who can cast root.  Assuming root<br/>
sticks, bard doesn&#39;t have to worry about fleeing.  Not certain how long a<br/>
dragon raid takes so bard would most likely have to get rooted several times<br/>
throughout the battle.  Doubt the high level players would want to take the<br/>
risk though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; A bard can&#39;t twist songs sitting down as you know, and you are there for<br/>
&gt; 2 things - reducing mana regen time during buffing and to buff resists<br/>
&gt; during the fight. Without getting into a tactics discussion, if you are<br/>
&gt; only playing 1 song during the actual dragon battle then you aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; worth the spot you are filling, and a warrior would be much better<br/>
&gt; served in it. On every dragon raid or large scale fight, you want to<br/>
&gt; show your group just how valuable a bard is, like when people from other<br/>
&gt; groups die from attrition, but your resist buffs keep your party going<br/>
&gt; until the very end.<br/>
