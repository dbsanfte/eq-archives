<div id="ygrps-yiv-582423923">Man that bites considering all the switching we do between weapons and<br/>
instruments. Well I have dropped Lore like Tomahawks and Claw on the floor<br/>
and its always been there to pickup. Its a good thing Verant is so quick to<br/>
replace bug-lost items. My best friend a 47th Monk zoned into Sol B 2 weeks<br/>
ago and arrived totally nekkid, Verant still hasnt replaced his stuff even<br/>
though they have promised a complete restore of his charactor.<br/>

&gt;Destroyed from what? I have dropped mine several times and just picked them<br/>

dropped inside of a container) have a chance of being destroyed.  I lost a<br/>
Shiny Brass Shield to this in Everfrost. :P<br/>
