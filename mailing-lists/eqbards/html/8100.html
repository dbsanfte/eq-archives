<div id="ygrps-yiv-345543939">I have from a good source that this song is in fact broken, and currently<br/>
being worked on.  I&#39;m trying to get permission to repost the message this<br/>
info came from here.  But until then, I will not (it may be under NDA, etc.)<br/>

&gt;I have played with this song a bit, and while I do not think it is worth <br/>
&gt;having memorized, I&#39;m not convinced that it is broken.  On eight <br/>
&gt;different occasions, I have had a negative effect disappear as soon as <br/>
&gt;the song did its first static charge pulse.  This has only happened on <br/>
&gt;the first pulse of the song, it has only removed DOT buffs (from Necros, <br/>
&gt;SKs or Shamen), and it has often failed to remove DOT buffs, but the fact <br/>
&gt;that eight negative buffs have disappeared on the first pulse suggests to <br/>
&gt;me that it may actually be working (it may just be relatively worthless). <br/>
&gt;Or I may be the delusional victim of a misleading, albeit unlikely, <br/>
&gt;series of coincidences.  ;P   Has anyone else noticed this?<br/>
