<b>Subject:</b> Unexpected benefit from PoA? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407206515">Well the &quot;benefit&quot; would be for the players who either don&#39;t have the time<br/>
to camp the spawn points that drop good items or would rather just outright<br/>
purchase the good items.  I will admit that the people who try to camp those<br/>
sites and get the item for themself are likely to get frustrated.  If this<br/>
situation occurs, then the lower level charatcers could possibly use the<br/>
/yield rule (assuming it ever got implemented).  <br/>

	Heh benefit? Notice the one line go back to low level areas and camp<br/>
items<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; for cash. The problem here is that were camping low levle areas how many<br/>
&gt; people are gonna be bitching now?<br/>
