<div id="ygrps-yiv-130733252">My bar is all the way to the right now, I&#39;ll try moving it tonite and see if<br/>
I get a message.  I never did before, but knowing Verant its the message<br/>
that activates the sound support.<br/>

thanks, no one at Verant ever indicated there was a message to even look for<br/>
and I&#39;ve talked to at least 10 techies there.  Do the rest of you A3d users<br/>
get the A3d screen whenever you load up at startup?<br/>

&gt; Sigh.  Every time I hear something like this it reminds me how little<br/>
&gt; support you get from Verant.  I have an A3d card which Verant claims is<br/>
&gt; supported.  However, I do not hear the sounds mobs make outside of combat.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s right, no howling wolves, no chittering beetles, and more<br/>
importantly<br/>
&gt; no stomping giants.  Every giant in the game can sneak right up on me and<br/>
&gt; [...]<br/>
&gt; I have is not only supported, but tested to work as well?  Anybody else<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; these problems?  Another guildmate of mine has a different A3d card and it<br/>
&gt; works fine.  His is from a secondary manufacturer and mine is from A3d.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;d think he would be the one with the problem?<br/>
<br/>
Go to Options, select Sound, and bump up the sound effects<br/>
slider until you get a message saying &quot;3D sound enabled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s all there is to it.<br/>
