<div id="ygrps-yiv-160199939">I got a six note blade pretty recently (same stats as evensong).  I prefer<br/>
it to my yaks, mainly because level 50+ stuff (which is about all I seem to<br/>
fight anymore) resists the yak proc too much.  I&#39;ll either go for a six note<br/>
blade/gold koshigitana combo, or six note/orb of tishan combo depending on<br/>
whether or not an enchanter is handy.<br/>
Max damage with six note blade so far = 51.<br/>

  Maestro of Rancor dropped the Evensong on Saturday night.  Second <br/>
  one on our server to my knowledge.  I know the bard with the first<br/>
  drop.<br/>
<br/>
  Members of the Pantheon killed him after they themselves had perished <br/>
  twice to the bugger and us once.  I swear the guy was doing donuts <br/>
  around the plane looking for people to kill.  That, and the 4 mob<br/>
  train he was carrying around with him didn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
  Needless to say, I was the only bard on the plane at the time.<br/>
  Unfortunately, I have to wait until Maestro drops another, since<br/>
  the weapon was &#39;accidentally&#39; looted by someone who cannot use it.<br/>
  &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
  Do you use your evensong over your yk, Shada?<br/>
