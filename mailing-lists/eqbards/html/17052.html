<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860814865">I still didn&#39;t have Mistmoore Drums, probably the only bard on my server<br/>
above level 45 without them.  I refused to buy them or trade for them,<br/>
sorta a general principle thing.  Anyhow the servers come back up and<br/>
within 10 mins all of lguk is camped so my group heads to k keep, fun but<br/>
another guild is having an event in there so we politely leave.  Ah...<br/>
someone new to the guild has never done Mistmoore we find out!  Great, I<br/>
love the place so we pop over.  We zone in and I tell my group hang on,<br/>
lemme go scout.  I run around the castle and what to my wondrous eyes<br/>
should appear?  Mythani!  Holding... a flute!  My drums!  :)<br/>
