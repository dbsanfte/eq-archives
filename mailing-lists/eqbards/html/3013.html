<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910856223">Just one more piece of advice. From what I remember of being level 3,<br/>
anything you can kill&#39;s loot sucks. I dont think your getting gipped as much<br/>
as the loot just sucks....<br/>

&gt;Hail!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d suggest that you stay in Misty until level 5 and you get Selos song for<br/>
&gt;speed running.  Then going to Qeynos will be a piece of cake - I even went<br/>
&gt;to the North Karana gypsy camp at like level 5.  Also, at level 3, you are<br/>
&gt;still a &quot;monster magnet&quot; and to get to Qeynos, you have to run by monsters<br/>
&gt;in a couple spots (as you get bigger than these monsters, they wise up and<br/>
&gt;ignore you but now they will attack on sight - which means as soon as you<br/>
&gt;can see their icon they can see you and want to et you.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as getting crappy prices from the halfling vendors, you could try<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;vendors in Kithikor Wood.  There are 2 shops very close to the Rivervale<br/>
&gt;zone and your faction may be different with these folk since they are<br/>
&gt;hummies.  But again, until you get bigger, expect that monsters will view<br/>
&gt;you as a tasty treat and don&#39;t wander about in Kithikor.  You have to go<br/>
&gt;down the path a short way but no more than a hundred yards or so and you<br/>
&gt;will shops - one on each side of the road.  Kith is still one of the most<br/>
&gt;scary zones to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But if you must go - heed the advice of others and go nekkid with your good<br/>
&gt;stuffs in the bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Find the tunnel in misty thicket that goes into the Runnyeye Mines - run<br/>
&gt;past the gobbies if they guard the entrance and zone in.  Now stay close to<br/>
&gt;the wall on the right and follow it thru to the platform - run the whole<br/>
 </span></blockquote>way<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;even if gobbies jump on you - take all right turns hug the wall and zone<br/>
&gt;into the Gorge of King Xorbb.  Check it out!  Some really big monsters!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to get past them, you climb the wall on the left side and follow the left<br/>
&gt;wall thru the gorge.  In a couple spots you will be forced down off the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wall<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and if you fall it will hurt bad. So be carefull on the turns and hug the<br/>
&gt;wall. If you are forced down look first to make sure the traffic is clear.<br/>
&gt;Then run hugging the wall until you can climb back up. Keep following the<br/>
&gt;left wall until you see the canyon that leads you out of the zone - you are<br/>
&gt;pretty much forced down at the end. Run to the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now you are in East Karana. Hug the zone wall on the right. Keep high on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;right until the river.  Keep and eye out for Broon - a big ol cyclops who<br/>
&gt;hangs by the river. Give him a wide berth but watch also for Gryffins<br/>
&gt;(flying monsters) and Gogrehounds and Plains cats.  Run parallel to the<br/>
&gt;river giving Broon a wide berth - to the big wooden bridge - cross it and<br/>
&gt;zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now you are in North Karana.  Keep the river on your left and keep going<br/>
&gt;south until it starts to turn west.  At the river bend be ware of the<br/>
&gt;Raiders - they are bandits and will attack if you get too close.  Give them<br/>
&gt;a wide berth but keep the river on your left.  You will see a huge stone<br/>
&gt;bridge - remember this because you can run across if you need to zone (and<br/>
&gt;later you will prolly come back here for the Lute quest.)  But if you are<br/>
&gt;going to Qeynos - don&#39;t cross it but keep river on your left and run run<br/>
 </span></blockquote>run<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;until you zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ahh now West Karana, run huggin the river on your left - a long long long<br/>
&gt;run.  Past fisherman and womans two times and finally you see the Barbarian<br/>
&gt;fishing village.  Now you can turn north and follow zone wall north past<br/>
&gt;some towers keep them on your right and eventually a path that leads down a<br/>
&gt;canyon to the west --take it and run to the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In Qeynos hills now and getting very close.  Follow the path giving the<br/>
&gt;bears and wolves and everything a wide berth.  At the milestone take the<br/>
&gt;fork to the west and run to the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Finally, you are in North Qeynos - run down the path (hopefully not meeting<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Fippy Darkpaw or the Queenie Klicknik) to the city guards & gates and when<br/>
&gt;you chat with the folk explain that you have just come from Rivervale -<br/>
&gt;certainly someone will bind you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you live on Innoruuk, give me a tell and I may be able to guide you if I<br/>
&gt;am not too far away or otherwise engaged in a party.<br/>

&gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have one problem though ... none of the vendors like<br/>
&gt; me.  Any npc that will sell to me looks at me<br/>
&gt; &quot;apprehensively&quot;.  I went to every npc I could find and<br/>
&gt; found one that was disinterested ... but he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; (couldn&#39;t) sell to me.  So I&#39;m making crap money on my<br/>
&gt; loot.  At this rate, I&#39;m never gonna be able to even<br/>
&gt; afford songs, let alone any equipment (sewing kit &<br/>
&gt; patterns for example).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I need help!  Either, point me to someone in Rivervale<br/>
&gt; who will offer me decent prices or ...  If there isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; anyone that fits that bill, then I think I need to move<br/>
&gt; on to Qeynos.  In that case, I need good directions from<br/>
&gt; Rivervale to Qeynos.  Every travel guide I&#39;ve found gives<br/>
&gt; the directions the opposite way around ... and they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; not easily reversed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again,<br/>
