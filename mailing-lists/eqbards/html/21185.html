<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516678899">This list just seems to get nastier every time I read it.  I remember when<br/>
it was pretty friendly and we all shared info.<br/>
<br/>
I have better things to do with my time than read flames on my sig line (of<br/>
all things) which started as a joke between me and an old friend who I<br/>
grouped with regularly during Beta.  He always used to jokingly call me the<br/>
&quot;Bard of Norrath&quot; because of the stories I&#39;d tell him while we played.<br/>
Stories I gleaned from websites, both official and fan.  Stories I made up<br/>
about people like Dorn B&#39;dyn and other NPC&#39;s we would encounter.  We<br/>
originally met in Beta 2 and became very close friends.  A few months after<br/>
final started he vanished from the game and I heard no more from him for a<br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
I eventually found out, from his wife, that he had died in an automobile<br/>
accident caused by a drunk driver.  I have since left my signature as &quot;Bard<br/>
of Norrath&quot; in honor of his &quot;half joking&quot; name for me and since I knew him<br/>
in Beta 2 It was &quot;Bard of Norrath since Beta 2&quot; to honor his memory.<br/>
<br/>
He was the one who had convinced me to become a guide though I did<br/>
eventually retire when things got too crazy in my life.<br/>
He was the one who kept me playing in Final even though I had the &quot;Been<br/>
there, seen that&quot; attitude.<br/>
He helped me re-discover my joy of Norrath.<br/>
He will live forever in my thoughts as one of the kindest souls I know.<br/>
He will remain, for eternity, one of my truest friends.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for the foul language in my last post but that comment by Shada<br/>
and Blitz Krieg just really hurt.  I hope you can understand.  It&#39;s not<br/>
_just_ a game when real people&#39;s feelings are involved.<br/>
