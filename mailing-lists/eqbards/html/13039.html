 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re doing Celerity for atk speed, you can always add in Chant for<br/>
str/dex for additional damage (str) and procs (dex).<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;re meleeing, and you&#39;re fighting IGs outside where there&#39;s an<br/>
area no lower mobs move around in, use Chords of Dissonance for damage.<br/>
It will do more than bellow, and if you can manage to swap weapons/lute in<br/>
3 seconds for the pulse, it&#39;ll do more still (although with a borrowed yk,<br/>
might not be the best of ideas).<br/>
<br/>
Note Chords over Denon&#39;s, as you mentioned additional resists with<br/>
dual-purpose songs, and Denon&#39;s is dmg/ac debuff whereas Chords is<br/>
straight dmg.<br/>
