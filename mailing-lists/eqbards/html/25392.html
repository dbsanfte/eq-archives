<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015588008">No I started a character from scratch.  I never inquired to the<br/>
possibility of restoring Shada.  I deleted my no drop items and gave<br/>
away all tradeable items.  Any details on when the restore would date<br/>
back to?  Would I be restored at the time I was deleted (0 items) or<br/>
sometime before with my no drop items?<br/>
<br/>
God help me, why am I asking?<br/>

Heh heh, I see from your comment below that you too found out that even<br/>
a<br/>
deleted character can be recovered, sans items that aren&#39;t No Drop.  One<br/>
of<br/>
our guild members recently returned from the dead in this fashion when<br/>
the<br/>
player decided that maybe quitting forever wasn&#39;t really what he wanted<br/>
to<br/>
do in the long run.<br/>
