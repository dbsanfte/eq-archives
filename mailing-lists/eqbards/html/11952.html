&gt; &gt; Think for a moment.  If CT *really* had a death touch, what<br/>

&gt; &gt; around in his realm?  DT all of them.  Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>
&gt; &gt; do if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>
&gt; &gt; game, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; super-powers.<br/>

&gt; You were doing so well... then this paragraph.<br/>

&gt; 1.  Why have denizens if anytime anything comes you insta-kill?  let<br/>
&gt; your pets have some fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  Yes.  Stop giving these gods all sorts of god-like powers!  What<br/>
&gt; are you thinking? *grin*<br/>

<br/>
The fact that he was put there and is killable implies that he<br/>
can and should be killed.  Giving him a power which if applied<br/>
with any iota of intelligence would result in him never dying<br/>
just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  I suppose you could claim it&#39;s<br/>
like that to make up for lack of AI, but then you&#39;re using an<br/>
artificial out-of-game reason to justify an in-game behavior -<br/>
which means it&#39;s exactly what I labeled it - a cop-out.<br/>
