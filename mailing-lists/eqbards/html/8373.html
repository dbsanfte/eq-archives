<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892792753">AH!  Minkin! What blasphemy!  Well, sometime you&#39;ll have to<br/>
meet Halana, she is a very kind Shaman I assure you. :-)  I don&#39;t know what<br/>
level you are, but she is 31 now, so if you&#39;d ever like to fight together<br/>
give me a tell.  Course she&#39;s going to be camping rubi for the next couple<br/>
days in a desperate attempt to get some hot red pants while they can still<br/>
be had.<br/>

				i&#39;ve found that most of the attitude problem<br/>
players are either wizards or<br/>
				druids.... being kill stealers or/and<br/>
kiters.  And my personnal favorite top<br/>
				hated is Barbarian shamans, i&#39;ve only met<br/>
one nice one of them so far.  And<br/>
				i agree,  when i had my newbie troll i found<br/>
that most of the trolls and<br/>
				ogres i met were very friendly, then again,<br/>
most newbies are as they havent<br/>
				been exposed to kill stealing dungeons yet<br/>
where they lose their innocence. <br/>
