&gt; What is up with Kithicor?  I ran into a mean RED orc there the other nite<br/>
&gt; that chased me out of there and into Rivervale in a hurry.  All I remember<br/>
&gt; was the painful hits and a &quot;lord something&quot; attached to his name.  Any<br/>
&gt; clues?  Is there an orc camp in the zone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lord Shin Ra by any chance?  He seems to pop up in orc camps on <br/>
occassion.  Nasty mob.<br/>
