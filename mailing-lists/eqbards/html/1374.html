&gt; I just bought the song and have yet to try it out. I understand faction and<br/>
&gt; all. I was wondering about npc&#39;s with no faction standing (say a bat, or a<br/>
&gt; wasp for example - I would also think even Mistmoore Gargoyles fall under<br/>
&gt; this category), if you use the song on something that is &quot;ready to attack&quot;,<br/>
&gt; does it make the creature &quot;indifferent&quot; or &quot;apprehensive&quot;?? Or does it only<br/>
&gt; work on npc&#39;s with faction ratings? It would be cool to be able to walk into<br/>
&gt; an evil city using this song, kinda like an evil enchanter could disguise<br/>
&gt; him/herself and walk into Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that since it affects the entire faction, you SHOULD be able to walk<br/>
into an evil city and start changing their factions... but:<br/>
<br/>
a) I have a suspicion you have to modify their faction before combat gets<br/>
started, so for aggressive NPCs, you&#39;d better sing at them before they see you.<br/>
<br/>
b) Cities usually have many factions.  I&#39;d hate to have the guards love me only<br/>
to get squished by a merchant.<br/>
<br/>
c) I have no idea how long this effect lasts.<br/>
