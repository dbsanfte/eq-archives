 </span></blockquote>You prove my point.  You feel since your DoTs take over 2<br/>
minutes (and fights are usually much shorter), it&#39;s useless in<br/>
a group.  Melee attacks are basically DoTs.  Melee classes<br/>
don&#39;t have the pets or nukes which you feel are your primary<br/>
contribution to a group.  How do you think they feel?  Sure<br/>
they can tank, but you&#39;ve said you can take seafury cyclopses<br/>
solo (presumably with your pet tanking), so obviously your pet<br/>
can tank just as well as them if not better (green giants will<br/>
eat most melee classes solo, much less the seafuries).<br/>
