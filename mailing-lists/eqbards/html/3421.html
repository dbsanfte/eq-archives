<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516604826">Ok, now you have me hooked.  I HATE Kithicor!  It is the most scary place I<br/>
have been - so far.  But I keep going back!  I have had Ged make me his<br/>
Bearskin gloves and am looking for a HQ LION to get the finest ones in all<br/>
of Norrath.  Jed&#39;s druid friend - she won&#39;t talk to me not even with my cha<br/>
song.  <br/>
<br/>
Is anyone keeping track of the various inter-twining of these kind of<br/>
things?<br/>
<br/>
For example, talking to Furball Miller on the Miller farm. His sad story of<br/>
woe.  Then, there is the letter from the DE that the halfling in the<br/>
Hogcallers Inn has (part of the Lady Shae quest.) I got the letter and read<br/>
it.  It implies that you can get a special thing if you deliver it to the<br/>
correct person. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there is some underlying tale about Norrath or are these just<br/>
independent little quest things.<br/>

		Want to hear some suspicions?<br/>
<br/>
		I think Ged and his Girlfriend (not recalling he name) are<br/>
either dead (we are talking to their<br/>
		ghosts) or cursed. He (or she, likely she) may be a<br/>
werewolf. I think they had a nice little house<br/>
		in the Kithicor until it was burned down or destroyed in<br/>
some manner.<br/>
<br/>
		That lake, that lake *sigh* there is something UP with it<br/>
(besides two piranha).<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway we have a bunch of really weird data points about it,<br/>
which might be random, but might NOT<br/>
		be.<br/>
<br/>
		Truth is out there<br/>
