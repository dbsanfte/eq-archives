<div id="ygrps-yiv-400004401">I saw a Erudite banking peacefully in Felwithe, and fire off his guise<br/>
(showing off or by accident) and the pair of bankers promptly destroyed<br/>
him. I&#39;ve never seen a L50 die that fast.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure why this happened, but I don&#39;t believe his Felwithe faction was<br/>
abnormally low. Anyone else know?<br/>
