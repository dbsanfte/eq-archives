&gt; I should have explained about this:  Invis and Camo won&#39;t work.  Mordrath or his<br/>
&gt; pet or the guards or something can see invisible/camo&#39;d people.  I was told<br/>
&gt; Invis won&#39;t work, but I tried Camo myself and died for it 3 more times.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What might help people is if they remember that Meldrath is a necromancer, and so he<br/>
probably has cast Deadeye (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) on himself, enabling him<br/>
to see invisible.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s odd that he always seems to start his fights with Charm though.  Most other<br/>
necro NPCs use a disease spell or poison bolt or something.  Even Evil Eyes, who are<br/>
enchanters and therefore charm specialists usually don&#39;t charm you until 2 or 3<br/>
spells into the fight.<br/>
