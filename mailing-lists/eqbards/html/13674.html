<div id="ygrps-yiv-172303082">Naeeldar you&#39;ve twisted my original point.  I stated that Verant&#39;s main<br/>
focus should be on fixing what is broke in the game and then adding new<br/>
quests/items for all levels 1-50.  This benefits everyone and is a<br/>
legitimate problem.  Just because you don&#39;t agree with me doesn&#39;t it isn&#39;t<br/>
legitimate.  Your only concern is overcrowding for level 50 players.  Fixing<br/>
this benefits only a select group.  <br/>
<br/>
This issue be easily settled if Verant would conduct a poll when you log in.<br/>
I&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t use that capability more often.<br/>

&gt; a<br/>
&gt; legititment problem and then you have people complaining they never get<br/>
&gt; something new. So I&#39;ll put this simple see the diffrence? See who deserves<br/>
&gt; the change?<br/>
