<div id="ygrps-yiv-533480604">Hmmm, maybe someone at Verant didn&#39;t realize it was company policy not to<br/>
further associate bards with the caster classes (ala Shimmering Orb, various<br/>
Totems, etc.)  Hopefully they won&#39;t get sacked for it!<br/>

Someone asked earlier if there were any bard quests currently in the<br/>
Temple of Solusek Ro. Well due to level 50 boredom, I make a newbie dark<br/>
elf on the test server and went to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
There are indeed 2 bard NPCs there, but they were in fact the only 2<br/>
NPCs in there who wouldnt talk to me. They con&#39;d apprehensive, while<br/>
everything else was indifferent no matter what race/class it was.<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve only seen NPCs for misc stuff (resetting your specialization<br/>
skills), Necros, Wizards, Mages, Clerics, and Bards. So guess we lucked<br/>
out so far unless they&#39;re still adding other quest NPCs for other<br/>
classes.<br/>
