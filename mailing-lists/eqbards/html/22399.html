<div id="ygrps-yiv-139082105">First, sorry to anyone who I may have offended. My comment about our current political situation meant no offense, but you have to admit that this is a pretty interesting (and to me amusing) situation that we have going on with our election process. And I agree that if the voting guide that is handed out ahead of time has the candidates listed in one particular order, the ballot card should have it in the same order. I believe the Demos had given approval for this particular ballot card before the election, so I think, ultimately, the point is rendered moot.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m in the Democratic party, so I&#39;m not trying to slam them, just an observation.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of a situation my wife ran into last night. After getting 60 eggs (she&#39;s a big baking fan) she went to give them to my necromancer character to pass onto her baking character. Unfortunately she gave them to my pet and lost all her eggs. Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one backpack. :-) It&#39;s similar to the voting situation in that it was kind of careless not to double-check your work.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I mean if us American&#39;s can&#39;t figure out which darn holes to punch in a<br/>
&gt; &gt;ballot card (even a person with a doctorate was quoted as saying that it<br/>
&gt; &gt;was confusing) then how can we expect Verant to always get things right. ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mmh no comments, apart from that the ballot card looked pretty confusing to me,<br/>
&gt; luckely Im Danish we still cast our votes with a ball pen and an X.<br/>
<br/>
No, us Americans want to have the latest in technology (always). I&#39;ve got to say I was amused to listen to how they define various hole punches: (btw, I only heard them talking, so I don&#39;t know if the word &quot;chad&quot; is right, but it sure sounded like it).<br/>
<br/>
Hanging Chad - 1 corner of paper hanging from the hole punch - counts as vote<br/>
Swinging Door Chad - 2 corners - counts<br/>
Tri-Chad - 3 corners - counts<br/>
Pregnant Chad - the paper is bulging, but not pressed through - doesn&#39;t count<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hmm, they are based in San Diego. Surfing programmers? Guards should be<br/>
&gt; &gt;responding to our hails with, &quot;What&#39;s up dude? The waves are looking fine<br/>
&gt; &gt;my man!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whats wrong with surfers!!!! well Windsurfers anyway!?!?<br/>
<br/>
Lol. Nothing. Surfers are great. So are windsurfers (though I fall off of them way too much) I prefer sailing myself. I&#39;m a lot further away from the sharks (we have great whites in our waters) than the guys who lay on their boards looking like a sunbathing sea lion.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, back to bardic stuff.<br/>
