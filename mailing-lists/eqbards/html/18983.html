<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514656049">Here is what I had in yesterday for Sebilis:<br/>
<br/>
Clarity<br/>
Purifying Rythmns<br/>
Verses of Victory<br/>
(Various times Guardian Rythmns, Hymn, Absonant Binding, Niv&#39;s)<br/>
Chain of Frost<br/>
Chant of  Flame<br/>
Fufills Curtailing<br/>
Jig<br/>
<br/>
90 percent of the time, I weave the 3 chants.  If I also melee hand to hand,<br/>
that seems to be enough of a taunt that I can garauntee a summons - even<br/>
with 2 SK&#39;s and a Rogue doing melee. So, I wait til near the end to h2h<br/>
melee while weaving the chants. When we rushed the emperor after pulling his<br/>
guards out and killing them as singles, I played purifying and guardian with<br/>
my selos drum.  Even so, he could stick some low level disease on us<br/>
(infectious cloud?).  Since that really didn&#39;t matter, on later rushes, I<br/>
switched to the 3 chants.  He resisted them so much, I switched to weapons<br/>
and melee&#39;d him with Verses and Jig and whatever playing.<br/>
<br/>
We did this 8 or 10 times.  One time just as we are rushing the room, our<br/>
cleric is saying &quot;really bad PL, really bad PL...&quot; and He goes LD very soon<br/>
after we atack the Emperor Chottal (60 necro?).  Emperor has a nice spectral<br/>
pet btw. Any how the enchanters tell us not to panic and start applying<br/>
runes as needed. I switch to lute and heal & niv&#39;s.  And somehow we managed<br/>
to win. Now that was fairly exciting.  Deep in the first floor of Seb - no<br/>
evac - no cleric and a named boss mob - heh.<br/>
<br/>
So, it depends on where you are and who you are with and what is happening<br/>
at the moment.<br/>

&gt; hehe you guys that analyze everything to death make my head spin :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At 40th I have the following songs memmed usually:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1)  Hymn  (Face it, you always will)<br/>
&gt; 2)  Celerity<br/>
&gt; 3)  Clarity<br/>
&gt; 4)  Fear<br/>
&gt; 5)  Accelerando/Jig/Lament/Psalm of Warmth/Psalm of Cooling/(insert useful<br/>
&gt; song here)<br/>
&gt; 6)  Pixie Strike<br/>
&gt; 7)  Charm/Bravura<br/>
&gt; 8)  Chains/Largo&#39;s<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When soloing I change out 6 and 5 for either:  Fufil&#39;s and Tuyens<br/>
(targetted<br/>
&gt; DoT&#39;s for kiting/charm kiting)<br/>
&gt; or:  CoD and DDD<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d say that I rarely use my level 1 to 10 songs except for Jig (which<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; always have its uses) Selo&#39;s and Hymn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than that once you get the next haste song upgrade you dump your<br/>
&gt; anthem (36th)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Song makeup, for me anyway, depends highly upon the group I&#39;m working<br/>
with.<br/>
&gt; If we have a shaman I mem my enchanter songs (pixie, charm, lullaby, fear,<br/>
&gt; chains)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If we&#39;re with an enchanter I go with my ranger set (chains, chant, Psalm,<br/>
&gt; Heal)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; etc...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d hardly say that I use my 1-10th songs more than my others.  It just<br/>
&gt; depends on the situation I&#39;m in.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s good to hear.  I saw the damage figures and the potential double<br/>
&gt; &gt; resist and thought my lvl 30 song might turn out to be as unexciting as<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 29 one I just got.  It still seems peculiar that our level 2 song<br/>
&gt; &gt; outdamages it though.  At what level will my songs start moving up the<br/>
&gt; &gt; scale? </span></blockquote></div>
