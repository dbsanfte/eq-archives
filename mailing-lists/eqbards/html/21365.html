I agree with this entire Paradigm.  There&#39;s a damn good reason that this<br/>
board is now getting 10-20 posts a day instead of what 70-80?<br/>

BTW - Just started an Iksar Necro.  In 18 months of playing a bard I<br/>
previously considered it anathema to start a new character...<br/>

I&#39;m still having fun playing Tani - not disillusioned at all yet.  However,<br/>
whenever I mention how much fun playing my bard is, all the 55+ bards in my<br/>
guild just about roll over laughing and say &quot;just wait&quot;... like I&#39;ve said<br/>
before, I think Verant sees Bards as their &quot;crowning achievement&quot; and just<br/>
can&#39;t see why we&#39;re complaining.  Either that, or the person they originally<br/>
had design the Bard has left and nobody knows how he coded it or such :)<br/>

Tani, 28th Bard of SPLAT (was running along in Overthere in the fog....<br/>
there&#39;s a big chasm there :))<br/>
