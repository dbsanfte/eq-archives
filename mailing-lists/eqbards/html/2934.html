<div id="ygrps-yiv-672476866">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have a C300A (not overclocked), a TNT, and 128 MB RAM. I can almost always<br/>
juggle 3 songs (mind you, I don&#39;t always do it, tho I should...but it&#39;s<br/>
doable for me.) It could be the view I&#39;m using; I play in the first view in<br/>
800x600 res, and although I do get slowdowns with high particle density,<br/>
setting it to low means I still see root and get almost no lag even with 3-4<br/>
24&#39;s in my group (I&#39;m usually the low level...Unrest is a cool if deadly<br/>
place to be if you&#39;re inside the house, but it&#39;s no fun outside.)<br/>
<br/>
As to the hot buttons, I like to keep my 3 most heavily rotated songs and my<br/>
attack key in the first box (for obvious reasons), along with Forage and<br/>
Sense Heading (I suppose this could be changed to Loc and Assist, too.) My<br/>
second box has another Attack on top, then a Loc, then the six slots I use<br/>
for my inventory- the two melee weapons on top, and the four bottom<br/>
inventory slots on the bottom. The first three of these hold instruments,<br/>
the fourth is empty (this is why the mino horn doubling as brass and wind is<br/>
soooooo important- I can switch to an instrument in 3 mouse clicks because I<br/>
have an empty space left to put the weapon in.) The third and fourth have<br/>
various utility commands for when I&#39;m in the second view and don&#39;t want to<br/>
switch back, and the last two boxes are so far empty. Try that, especially<br/>
the inventory thing- I have never dropped an item needlessly since I started<br/>
using it.<br/>

comes out)<br/>

&gt; Does anyone *not* have this problem?  My system is pretty high<br/>
&gt; end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>
&gt; got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>
&gt; off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>
&gt; from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>
&gt; Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>
&gt; speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>
&gt; with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The thing that really irks me about this is that it&#39;s a client<br/>
&gt; side problem.  The determination that &quot;you haven&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; recovered&quot; to sing another song is completely client side, and<br/>
&gt; completely dependent on the speed of your system.  When I had<br/>
&gt; a P200 with a Voodoo 1, it took ages for the song buttons to<br/>
&gt; un-grey when I stopped singing.  When I upgraded to my current<br/>
&gt; system, it was almost instant, except as noted above when lots<br/>
&gt; of spells are flying.  I would prefer to be able to turn off<br/>
&gt; the button un-grey animation sequence and suffer a flat time<br/>
&gt; delay which doesn&#39;t change with CPU speed.<br/>
