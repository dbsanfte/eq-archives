been doing tests on stats and their effect on melee quite a bit, and<br/>
more and more it&#39;s becoming clear that level and/or atk/def are the most<br/>
important factors in your abilitys in melee. Tests have shown that str<br/>
does nothing but raise your max damage, while your mean damage basically<br/>
stays the same. The same tests show that agi over 100 does nothing.<br/>
People are still in denial about this though, which is nice if you&#39;re<br/>
still trying to unload those serp bracers and mithril breastplates. It&#39;s<br/>
too bad bards were left off the black enamalled breastplate.<br/>
<br/>
Quite a while ago one of my friends mentioned that his warrior continued<br/>
to be more effective after all his skills had maxed, all the way to L50<br/>
where he said he was much better than he had been at L39.<br/>
