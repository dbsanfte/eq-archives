<div id="ygrps-yiv-413914573">No, I haven&#39;t read of the accounts you mentioned, but I have read similiar accounts of similiar occurances in Neriak. And the only thing I can respond with is &quot;Sometimes $h!t happens.&quot; There is always within the realm of possibility the chance that sometime will have trained a guard to your supposedly &quot;safe&quot; bind point just prior to your dying. It can happen, I admit it. But that does not mean that evil cities are &quot;unbindable&quot; for good characters. it just means it&#39;s more dangerous. More dangerous than running naked across a couple zones? That decision I leave to each individual.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a row in one of these unfortunate instances. If you respawn and are immediately attacked by a guard at your bind point, you need to use the /quit command. This immediately exits you from the game without the 30 second camping wait. You may need to wait a few minutes for that guard to return to his post before reentering the game, or you may have to resort to moving the guard with a mule character. Such are the dangers inherent in binding in enemy territory. But again, that does not mean it&#39;s not feasible. Just dangerous. Everyone&#39;s personal limit of danger varies.<br/>

LMAO.  You obviously haven&#39;t read the all too numerous accounts of people,<br/>
some of them bards, who have been bound in a safe spot in Grobb only to die<br/>
in Guk and get about 20 LOADING PLEASE WAIT messages before they<br/>
disconnected their PC because someone had accidentally trained a guard to<br/>
their bind point by hitting the brilliant &#39;a&#39; key when trying th say<br/>
&#39;What...&#39; before hitting the &#39;enter&#39; key.<br/>
The last one I know of a 19th level bard lost 2 full levels before he<br/>
disconnected and had to create a mule to move the guard so he could ever<br/>
play again.<br/>

	Kitasi the quester<br/>
	Laughs at those who thinks bards can safely bind in evil cities<br/>
	Heck, pretty soon Qeynos and Freeport will both be evil cities to<br/>
me!<br/>

PS 	On E&#39;ci, a well established server with dozens of 46+ players, I<br/>
have been the only 	one on the entire continent of Erud at least a dozen<br/>
times in the last month, and 	that was at only 1am EST!</div>
