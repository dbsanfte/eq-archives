<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828500663">Here is what happened to you.  The Orc you left alive went and told all his<br/>
friends about you and your group (mobs will spread agro when near each<br/>
other).  As other players killed the orcs you got faction hits for still<br/>
being on their hate list.  If a orc got close enough to you to directly agro<br/>
(when you are on a mobs hate list the re-agro range is huge) they would head<br/>
for you, in-route they must have gotten stuck on a tree or from lag they<br/>
appeared to teleport into the middle of you.  They were teleporting up into<br/>
Kelethin as a anti-exploit measure that keeps casters from blasting critters<br/>
from a high places with no fear of retaliation.  The only way to clear the<br/>
agro is to zone/camp/die, till then the agro will keep spreading.  <br/>
<br/>
This happens in the planes all the time, and I had it happen once in lower<br/>
guk.  The whole live side got agro&#39;d on my party due to a wizard running an<br/>
eye of zom over to live side.  Whenever I would go near frenzied room to<br/>
pull I would get a mino or three and a few live frogs training back to the<br/>
Hand room.  It was pretty funny :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was my second petition.  First was at 6th lvl<br/>
&gt; when  Orc Centurians were spawning atop the Orc lift<br/>
&gt; in Klelthin.  We retreated from Orc Hill because the<br/>
&gt; volume was too much for us.  Kept getting faction<br/>
&gt; messages even tho we weren&#39;t fighting any more....got<br/>
&gt; to the bottom of the lift and rested.  Kept getting<br/>
&gt; faction messages.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The guards at Kelethin are a bit dense...we were<br/>
&gt; attacked again and again.  We moved to the top of the<br/>
&gt; lift....kept on getting faction messages.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Resting at the top of the lift, faction messages<br/>
&gt; continued.  Cents were spawning among us and<br/>
&gt; attacking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My petition was answered by GM Traikis who told me: <br/>
&gt; &quot;It&#39;s fairly common for orcs to spawn above the lift.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was not impressed.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The faction messages continued until we all died and<br/>
&gt; then the orcs stopped spawning around us<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been quite lucky. I&#39;ve never had problems<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe I have an honest face?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;That&#39;s what I thought too, but apparently the<br/>
&gt; &gt; teleport spot for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Butcherblock<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;is at about 10,000 ft.  You immediately fall and<br/>
&gt; &gt; take 10,000 points anyhow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;which is as you can guess instantly fatal.  Not<br/>
&gt; &gt; good when you are bound in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Halas at the time as I was.  The GM&#39;s never<br/>
&gt; &gt; responded to my petition even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;though I was beneath the world and was supposedly<br/>
&gt; &gt; teleported to a &quot;safe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;spot&quot;<br/>
