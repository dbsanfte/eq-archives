Well, I did my usual ritual last night and pulled out Lullaby and Pixie <br/>
Strike to see what unannounced changes might have occurred. It was prompted <br/>
after I used Pixie a few nights ago on some irritating casters. Here is <br/>
what I found (*boggle* at will). <br/>
Neither Lullaby or Pixie Strike gave a secondary resist message in over 200 <br/>
applications of each. I tested Lullaby in the usual way versus some lvl 1 <br/>
newbie mobs in Misty Thicket this time. My resists for Lullaby were in the <br/>
range of 35%. Pixie Strike also showed no secondary resists and the overall <br/>
resist level for Pixie Strike against level 1 mobs was 7%! <br/>
Okay, now for some analysis. I figure one of three things has happened <br/>
here. <br/>
1. Secondary resists have been removed and basic resist chance modified to <br/>
compensate. <br/>
2. Secondary resists have had their message component removed so it doesn&#39;t <br/>
hit you in <br/>
the face how high the secondary resist is. <br/>
3. Secondary resists are now correctly only occurring on mobs above a <br/>
certain level (originally claimed by GZ directly to be 35th). <br/>
From what I observed, the resist rate on Lullaby was too high to simply be a<br/>
<br/>
case of the secondary resist being removed on mobs under a certain level. <br/>
On the other hand, the resist rate I saw for Pixie Strike showed little <br/>
possibility that the secondary resist could still be there as it was before.<br/>
<br/>
I Pixie Strike&#39;d myself 50 times and never saw a secondary resist message so<br/>
<br/>
level 32 isn&#39;t the point at which it starts if that&#39;s the issue. I did <br/>
resist Pixie Strike 50% of the time however with an MR of 42 which seems <br/>
high. <br/>
Overall I think I&#39;m leaning towards the possibility that the secondary <br/>
resist is either gone from both and the primary resist rate adjusted <br/>
accordingly, or that the change has already gone in to reduce the secondary <br/>
on Pixie while at the same time removing the secondary message and just <br/>
giving one resist or not based on the two resist chances. <br/>
thoughts? <br/>
