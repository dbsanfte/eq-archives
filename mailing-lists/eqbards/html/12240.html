The Ballad of Robinshire<br/>
<br/>
Through the muck and mire tread Robinshire<br/>
´┐¢Till he met with a troll guard´┐¢s stare<br/>
The great Grobb guard bashed him hard<br/>
And he flew up through the air<br/>
<br/>
Being quick in the head, our hero said<br/>
´┐¢I´┐¢ll put the shield beneath me.´┐¢<br/>
He became a glider upon the mire<br/>
And slid across to safety.<br/>
<br/>
The guard was sore rolling on the floor<br/>
Laughing as Robin stood aghast.<br/>
It wasn´┐¢t hard to talk that guard<br/>
Into leaving their differences past.<br/>
<br/>
They went to bathe in Lake Rathe,<br/>
And decided to do some boating.<br/>
The troll did row, with shield in tow<br/>
And Robin on the shield floating.<br/>
<br/>
Making a wake across the lake,<br/>
He heard and island trumpet<br/>
An Aviak camp had a ramp<br/>
And Robin decided to jump it.<br/>
<br/>
Up the ramp he went, well intent<br/>
To fly higher than an Aviak pheasant<br/>
As he slid by, he waved good-bye <br/>
Confounding three Aviaks present.<br/>
<br/>
A good troll guard can row real hard<br/>
And robin soared high through the air.<br/>
Robin found him in Rathe Mountain<br/>
Flying straight to a giant standing there.<br/>
<br/>
With a dropping jaw, the giant saw<br/>
The strangest bird he had seen all day.<br/>
He waved his arms sounding alarms<br/>
Trying to shush that bird away.<br/>
<br/>
To the giant´┐¢s dread, Robin hit his head<br/>
And drove him underground.<br/>
Buried in place, his only trace:<br/>
His arms stuck out of a mound.<br/>
<br/>
Now you see the history<br/>
Of the arms reaching into the sky.<br/>
Of Robin´┐¢s fun my tale is done<br/>
And I must bid you goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
