<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-794374841">grats mara.  first advice is as you said, get a big buffer before you go.<br/>
planes and dragons have taken me from level 55ish down to level 50 and less<br/>
than 2 bubbs.  for songs i usually play mystic shielding (very few mobs use<br/>
fire/cold based spells that i&#39;ve noticed) and verses of victory (celerity<br/>
and/or chant of battle before level 50) on normal pulls.  i always keep<br/>
pixie up to help the enchanters.  there are a few mobs up there we can get<br/>
it to stick on, but don&#39;t use it unless asked.  pixieing a mob that&#39;s messed<br/>
gets the enchanter who messed it  killed fast.  usually someone shouts Shada<br/>
mes such and such.  we can mes Loathing Liches, Abhorrents, Revenants,<br/>
sometimes Banshees and a couple other things.  don&#39;t bother on Golems or<br/>
Clerics.  i&#39;m assuming you are planning on going to hate instead of fear<br/>
when i say all this.  good luck to you =)<br/>

&gt; Hello fellow bards.  I have finally, finally advanced out of <br/>
&gt; level 45 hell.  Hurrah!<br/>
&gt;  Of course I have no sense and the very next morning I went <br/>
&gt; on a Vox raid and she<br/>
&gt; kindly took it from me.  Twice.  Ouch.  Ah well, it would <br/>
&gt; have been worth it but<br/>
&gt; alas no horn =(.  Still, the Seafury Cyclops eventually <br/>
&gt; yielded the re-ding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way, I used the knowledge I gained here about good <br/>
&gt; strategies for Nagafen and<br/>
&gt; Vox to prepare my song list.  Nagafen was last week, and yes <br/>
&gt; he thought bard tasted<br/>
&gt; really good too.  Lost the drum lotto on that one *pout*.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have 46 to get through before I attempt the Planes - I want <br/>
&gt; that margin! - but<br/>
&gt; that will be soon I hope.  I have read a few posts on the <br/>
&gt; topic of Plane strategies,<br/>
&gt; but am eager for more.  Help me out please?<br/>
