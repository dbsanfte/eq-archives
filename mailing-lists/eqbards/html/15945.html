<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-395789776">I had been hunting orcs around in Oasys for some time. A last week (while I<br/>
was 16) I was soloing and the only place where I could find orcs was in<br/>
camp 1. but there were 4 of them (certain death...), so I decided to try<br/>
something different...<br/>
I used the charismatic carrilon on 3 of them, bringing their factions from<br/>
&quot;ready to attack&quot; to &quot;indiferent&quot; con, then I just ran through the camp and<br/>
got a safe and nice pull.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you guys done this?<br/>
I have never heard anything concerning this strategy on this list... <br/>
Hope I have added something good.<br/>
