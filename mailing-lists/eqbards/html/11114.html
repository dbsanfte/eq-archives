<div id="ygrps-yiv-734772619">I have to come to our spot, my love<br/>
Barefoot I walk, clad as the Satyr<br/>
In clothes made of leather, <br/>
Dusted of earth<br/>
<br/>
I have come past the water, my love<br/>
Cold, frigid and cleansing<br/>
Limbs numb, unforgiving<br/>
My body submerged<br/>
<br/>
I have come to the gypsies, my love<br/>
Loud music and dancing<br/>
Women singing and prancing<br/>
Living in tents for a hearth<br/>
<br/>
I have come to the campfire, my love<br/>
Feel heat warming, clothes drying<br/>
Still the heat may be lying<br/>
There is a coldness lingering still<br/>
<br/>
I have come back to our spot, my love<br/>
I hold the rings for our wedding<br/>
I hope to find you here medding<br/>
And give them to you, I will<br/>
<br/>
But you are not there<br/>
	And I see you, walking with another<br/>
But you are not there<br/>
	And I see you, walking with another<br/>
But you are not there<br/>
	And I see you, walking with another<br/>
But you are not there<br/>
	And I see you, walking with another<br/>
<br/>
The wedding rings fall<br/>
But my heart reaches the ground first<br/>
The rings bounce and roll<br/>
But my heart, shatters´┐¢<br/>
