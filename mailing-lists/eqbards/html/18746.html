<div id="ygrps-yiv-778643612"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 2)  Bards have ways of reducing their taunt level now (Song of dawn,<br/>
&gt; harmonic weapons)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>easy for them to say and difficult for us to test, would you agree?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4)  The singing steel BOOTS are AC 18.  It&#39;s not like their <br/>
&gt; AC Sucks they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; still better than anything else we could get before, <br/>
&gt; including imbrued.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>agreed, i only have a problem with the effects.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5)  The &quot;Magic&quot; number for AC is about 800 AC.  After 800 <br/>
&gt; there seems to be<br/>
&gt; a dramatic drop in the amount that you get hit.  With buffs it&#39;s even<br/>
&gt; better.  Right now a level 50 warrior can get their AC to <br/>
&gt; about 800 maybe<br/>
&gt; 900 with items.  We can get ours to about the same.  With <br/>
&gt; singing steel I<br/>
&gt; will be able to get my AC (at 50th level) to over 900.  <br/>
&gt; (Warriors may be<br/>
&gt; able to break 1000 with theirs)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well at level 50 the only singing steel you can even think of getting are<br/>
gloves and boots.  you probably know where legs come from and you won&#39;t be<br/>
getting those.  no one has even found the bracers, arms, helm, or especially<br/>
the breastplate, which could be a bitch to get even at 60.  going with as<br/>
much AC as i can get, i am at 826AC at level 53.  i just won an RBB (have<br/>
not tried it on yet, have to get it from the current owner who just got a<br/>
CoF) so that will give me a big boost over a 0 AC haste sash, and my defense<br/>
is at 205 at level 53 and i don&#39;t think that is maxxed.  once i get the RBB<br/>
and max defense i estimate i will be just over 840AC at level 53 in full<br/>
imbrued and singing steel gloves (i can&#39;t wear the boots with the imbrued it<br/>
just looks awful, and gloves look ok and have more AC than my imbrued).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now... the effects on the armor REALLY ticks me off. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>same here, i agree with all you say about the bard, i don&#39;t think the AC is<br/>
too low, etc etc etc.  i just disagree about how easy you think it is be a<br/>
bard with 900AC.  quite an exaggeration.<br/>
