<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395393264">Wer you grouped at the time?  Did the whole group zone out?  If not then<br/>
actually you were getting copied onto the hate list entries of another party<br/>

back of the fights they probably never got within chase range of anything<br/>
until after it fixated on you so they never noticed.<br/>
