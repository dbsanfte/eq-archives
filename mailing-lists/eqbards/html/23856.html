Actually the people that simul play two characters in our guild do so quite<br/>
effectively.   Like I mentioned before though, 2 are warrior/cleric  combos<br/>
which might make it a little easier?  Another is druid/cleric and a fourth<br/>
does monk/chanter (I think that&#39;s gotta be tough).  Thats all I can think of<br/>
right now.  I think after a while you just get used to it but I trust any of<br/>
those players enough to enjoy being in their groups :)<br/>

&gt; I was thinking the same thing, but I suppose situations exist <br/>
&gt; where having<br/>
&gt; a player with two characters can be advantageous.  For <br/>
&gt; instance, if you<br/>
&gt; really, really want a particular class for a specific <br/>
&gt; function (e.g. manna<br/>
&gt; battery, evacer, puller) & the only character available is on <br/>
&gt; a player&#39;s<br/>
&gt; other PC, it might just be worth it to the group to have a <br/>
&gt; bard who only<br/>
&gt; sings the manna song, or a wizard who sits around waiting for <br/>
&gt; things to get<br/>
&gt; dicey, or a monk who pulls, feigns, and doesn&#39;t get up again <br/>
&gt; until it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; time to make another pull. &lt;/shrug&gt;  Any class played that <br/>
&gt; way is a waste<br/>
&gt; of the class, but still, maybe the group really, really, wants that<br/>
&gt; specific need filled.<br/>

&gt; Hehe...the loot fairy is welcome to visit me while I&#39;m away.  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My only question is, how can a person play more than one <br/>
&gt; character at a<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; effectively?  Yesterday in Dalnir, I was doing CC (heh...it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; weird being<br/>
&gt; high enough level to say this) for my group, and it was more <br/>
&gt; than enough to<br/>
&gt; keep me busy.  There is no way I could have played, say, a <br/>
&gt; warrior at the<br/>
&gt; same time, at least not effectively, much less a class that takes more<br/>
&gt; situational awareness, like a chanter or cleric (or a bard.  :)  ).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would be hesitant to be in a group where the same person <br/>
&gt; was trying to be<br/>
&gt; 2 classes in the same group/raid.  Especially in high risk, <br/>
&gt; multiple mob<br/>
&gt; dungeons, where not even Selos has a chance to save my hide.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sounds like things have worked out, though.  That&#39;s always a <br/>
&gt; good thing.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To answer some questions:<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;I&#39;m a little confused by a couple things.  Were all <br/>
&gt; people in both<br/>
&gt; groups in your guild? [Yes everyone in both groups is <br/>
&gt; technically in our<br/>
&gt; guild] And 2 of the people (including the tag-along<br/>
&gt; Enchanter) were being played by your guild leader? [ The <br/>
&gt; guild leader is<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Queen and her husband the king were both playing 2 characters <br/>
&gt; each. She was<br/>
&gt; playing the second L44 enchanter and her shaman and the king <br/>
&gt; was playing<br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; warrior and a cleric] &quot;Walk on the<br/>
&gt; guild&quot; means leaving the guild? [Yes I mean leave the guild. <br/>
&gt; Our guild is<br/>
&gt; based on the chivalric values and while this was hopefully <br/>
&gt; only a momentary<br/>
&gt; lapse of clear reasoning, I wanted them to see just how seriously we<br/>
&gt; considered this issue.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As to rules, we have loot rules to this effect that the king <br/>
&gt; wrote that<br/>
&gt; primaries get first cut. We discussed this at the time with several<br/>
&gt; guildmates and some were kinda divided over the rightness of <br/>
&gt; it. I guess<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; mudding factor was the chanter was actually there. We&#39;re a <br/>
&gt; fairly small<br/>
&gt; guild nowadays and this is the first disagreement over loot <br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve had. I<br/>
&gt; really think it wasn&#39;t greed as much as it was them having been too<br/>
&gt; insular.<br/>
&gt; The king has an odd work schedule (doctor) and so they have never been<br/>
&gt; involved in Planes raids or high level dungeon raids with <br/>
&gt; anyone else. We<br/>
&gt; tend to hang with other guilds like Venator Sapentia as we <br/>
&gt; have several<br/>
&gt; dual<br/>
&gt; guilded or ex&#39;excal friends in VS and so we get out more you <br/>
&gt; might say.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As to multiples, we currently own 4 accounts: we&#39;ve had <br/>
&gt; friends quit with<br/>
&gt; decent level characters and so we took over the account in <br/>
&gt; one case and<br/>
&gt; added the third just prior to that for bankspace mostly. We <br/>
&gt; have a 3rd pc<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; our office in easy reach of either of us so we do play up to <br/>
&gt; 3 lower level<br/>
&gt; characters at once usually wizard, necro, and a healer. We <br/>
&gt; play with our<br/>
&gt; friends alternates who are similiar level and there&#39;s never <br/>
&gt; any issue over<br/>
&gt; loot. We have a third generation of characters started and <br/>
&gt; nearing their<br/>
&gt; 20&#39;s now as well. It proves we&#39;re addicted of course but it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; given us a<br/>
&gt; chance to try out alot more character types; we&#39;ve probably got one of<br/>
&gt; everything at this point. I do think there are classes and <br/>
&gt; places where<br/>
&gt; playing 3 characters is not a good option. A couple of our <br/>
&gt; friends have<br/>
&gt; gotten second accounts from friends or family members as well <br/>
&gt; so now we<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; an address book of account names and passwords so we can move <br/>
&gt; people and<br/>
&gt; items at will. Imagine the surprise of our 40s ranger friend <br/>
&gt; when he logs<br/>
&gt; back on Saturday to find he&#39;s wielding Yaks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your comments everyone, I wanted a reality check <br/>
&gt; from some 3rd<br/>
&gt; parties and I appreciate the input.<br/>
