&gt; I get momentary pauses of maybe a tenth of a second or so when I turn these<br/>

&gt; player textures.  There isn&#39;t really a noticeable pause when there&#39;s only 1<br/>
&gt; or 2 people by the bank, but if there&#39;s even 10 people, the pause is a lot<br/>
&gt; longer (relatively, it pauses maybe half a second.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>16MB, but the game is designed to run on a card with 4MB, so I<br/>
don&#39;t think this is the case.  Like I said, I think it&#39;s<br/>
something about the mouse acceleration freaking out when one<br/>
&quot;instant&quot; the mouse is here, and the next &quot;instant&quot; (after the<br/>
hard drive and CPU have done the data transfer) the mouse is<br/>
all the way over there.  I don&#39;t have the problem when I turn<br/>
with the keyboard, but the turn rate doing that is much lower.  <br/>
The problem is much less pronounced in glide mode.<br/>
