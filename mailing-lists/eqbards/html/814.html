&gt;I am a Level 17 Bard. As such I am about that age where I have almost<br/>
&gt;completed my set of bronze armor. I already have 2 combine longswords, so<br/>
&gt;pretty soon I&#39;ll be as equipped as I ever really need to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To those of you who have reached and passed this point in the game, I would<br/>
&gt;like to know what it is that keeps you going? I&#39;ve seen basically every<br/>
&gt;zone, got everything I need. In real life this is the time I would finally<br/>
&gt;settle down and spend time with my family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just looking for tips on what to do now . . .<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm... level 17... Ahhh!  Yes, I remember 17.. I had just started doing<br/>
the caimans in Oasis and got my first piece of banded armor when a friend<br/>
traded the LJ vest for a banded tunic for me.  I was soooo happy I couldn&#39;t<br/>
see straight.  My first piece of non-leather armor!<br/>
<br/>
Level 17 is also what introduced me to the &quot;you&#39;ll never stay with your<br/>
friends&quot; problem, where my non-hybrid class friends could make 1.5 levels to<br/>
my one... or in other words, it was when I discovered that my friends were<br/>
very good powergamers and I wasn&#39;t. =)<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m lvl 33.  I still can&#39;t go beyond the bedroom chamber in gukbottom<br/>
but my old friends are starting to move beyond the tower there and<br/>
occasionally go to MistMoore.  I know Najena like the back of my hand, and<br/>
I&#39;ve been constantly in CazicThule since level 19.  I know the solution to<br/>
the 30th lvl song quest (I was the first to figure it out almost a month<br/>
ago), but I still haven&#39;t completed it because I can&#39;t get a group of<br/>
near-40th lvl chars together to help me do it.  But, I have every song up to<br/>
my level other than 30.  I&#39;m only 4 levels behind the top bard on my server,<br/>
and if I ever quit dieing, I might just catch them (8 levels ago they were<br/>
10 levels ahead of me).  I still don&#39;t have full plate armor, but then, the<br/>
pieces of banded armor that remain aren&#39;t that much less ac than plate, and<br/>
they weigh a lot less.  I have a combine LS and a barbed whip, and<br/>
despirately wish I could get better weapons.<br/>
<br/>
My friends from back when I was level 17?  Well, one started over, one quit<br/>
the game over item issues, and the others are either 3-5 levels above me and<br/>
won&#39;t group with me, or took time off an are now 10 levels behind me and<br/>
can&#39;t group with me.  I have some new friends in-game, perhaps better people<br/>
than my old friends. I still have never been to Paw, or BB, or MistMoore,<br/>
and I just visited Qeynos for the first time 2 levels ago.  Permafrost I<br/>
need to visit someday and I dread the thought of when we eventually must do<br/>
SolA and SolB.  I still have yet to extract my revenge on DVinn and Dorn,<br/>
and those pesky griffins in ECommons.<br/>
<br/>
I still have tremendous difficulty finding groups to adventure with, even<br/>
though I&#39;m in one of the largest (and perhaps most hated) guilds on my<br/>
server.  But now I&#39;m a mana-bard and finally those uppity spell-casters want<br/>
me around to sing Chorus of Clarity to them.<br/>
