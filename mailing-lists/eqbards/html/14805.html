<b>Subject:</b> Executioner Hood vs BI Crown <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042088920">Last night in the Savant room I got an EBM in a lotto.  Didn&#39;t need my<br/>
Scepter of Flame anymore so I traded it plus 100PP for an Executioner Hood.<br/>
I had thought the Exe hood was +9 STR and +5 DEX when I made the trade.  Its<br/>
actually +5 STR + 9 DEX.  I don&#39;t have any weapons that proc so right now<br/>
there isn&#39;t much of a reason right now for me to equip it over the BI Crown.<br/>
They both have the same AC and the same STR boost.  The BI Crown adds +5 to<br/>
all resist rates while the Exe hood gives you +9 DEX.<br/>
<br/>
Would like an opinion from the peanut gallery if I should keep the Exe Hood<br/>
for future use.  Eventually I hope to acquire Ykeshas so the +9 DEX from the<br/>
Exe Hood will increase the chances of the Ykesha procing.  The key question<br/>
is that by the time I can camp for Ykeshas (late 30s/early 40s), will the +9<br/>
DEX increase the number of procs by enough to outweigh the benefit of having<br/>
+5 to all resist rates? <br/>
<br/>
Whats a good price if I decide to sell the Exe Hood? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
