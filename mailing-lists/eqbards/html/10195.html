<div id="ygrps-yiv-393151960">When Kithicor first became undead hell, I got rooted by an undead<br/>
healer(?), was able to run into Rivervale, and once I had zoned in,<br/>
discovered that I was rooted.<br/>
<br/>
Early Last week I was in unrest and got rooted, I broke out on the next<br/>
pulse. managed to zone out, and once again discovered that I was rooted<br/>
OUTSIDE the zone. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Although Selo&#39;s does not break root anymore I thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; we had determined that it would on the next pulse if<br/>
&gt; &gt; you were playing it before being rooted.  Well, last<br/>
&gt; &gt; night in Mistmoore this did not appear to be the case.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It may have been changed/fixed.  Someone reposted a reply from<br/>
&gt; GZ I think at the Concert Hall message board, in which he said<br/>
&gt; Verant decided Accel breaking root was too powerful so they<br/>
&gt; removed it.  :-( </span></blockquote></div>
