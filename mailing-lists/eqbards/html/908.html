<div id="ygrps-yiv-267368466">Yikes . . . sounds like this game is one big chore to some people. Do you guys do anything fun?<br/>

    Actually, I have a lot of fun now.  Over the past few days, things seem to have turned around and I&#39;m grouping with people my level and above again.  And, thanks to a newer friend, an old festering wound that had all but destroyed an old friendship has been healed.<br/>
    To me, being with friends and doing the best I can do, is having fun.  Success is fun.  Being the best at what I do is fun.  Being acknowledged for what I do well is sheer ecstacy. =)  Helping others to have fun while having fun myself is perhaps the pinnacle.<br/>
