&gt;of what song I don&#39;t have available in the meantime.  Nobody likes me to stop singing Cantana in downtime,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d better have a really good reason.  And while I haven&#39;t worked out the math, I bet the net mana gain<br/>
&gt;from my singing the extra few pulses of Cantana on 3 casters can be used for comparable effect on the<br/>
&gt;MOB(s) regardless.  So why give myself the headache?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it would take you maybe 20 seconds to mem this song.  if you start the memorization as soon as you get<br/>
the cantana message, you have 12 free seconds to mem while the song is still active, then it&#39;ll cost you<br/>
11 seconds (8 more to mem, plus 3 more to restart cantana)  i doubt you restore enough mana in 2 pulses<br/>
of cantana to get close to 435 damage.</div>
