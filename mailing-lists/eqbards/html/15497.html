&gt; the empty health bar with the sad little puddle of purple<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup.  Targeting the person&#39;s health bar after they&#39;ve died and<br/>
left the zone targets their corpse.  At least it did when I<br/>
was looking for some group members&#39; corpses after a disastrous<br/>
Vox raid.<br/>
