&gt;&gt; I wasn&#39;t aware that the warsong gave a speed bonus - in fact, in my<br/>
&gt;&gt; comparisons (I use scarabs as my &quot;baseline&quot;) with no bonus, I hit less<br/>
&gt;&gt; often than the creature I&#39;m fighting, with the Warsong, it&#39;s the same,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt;&gt; the Anthem puts me at equal-to or faster.  Pretty sweet if you ask me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll run the tests again to double-check.  What level were you<br/>
&gt;when you ran this test?  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the<br/>
&gt;speedup for one or both were dependent on level/skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; In regards to stacking, I had someone point out that this might be<br/>
&gt;&gt; considered &quot;abuse&quot; - what are your thoughts?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to hear an official stance on it.  I heard someone<br/>
&gt;claim that Brad himself said it was OK, but have yet to verify<br/>
&gt;that.<br/>
