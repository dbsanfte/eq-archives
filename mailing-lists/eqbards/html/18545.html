<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856748709">Throwing is something that I love doing, so if I&#39;m twisting the 3 chants<br/>
I&#39;m also generally (not always though!) too far away to use the wood elf<br/>
fists of doom.  Sigh, if only there was an autoattack for throwing... Yes,<br/>
damage is terrible: 4-9 pts and YES I&#39;ve thrown my runed bone fork about 4<br/>
times now, but as the lone mage in our guild can tell you - it ain&#39;t<br/>
stopped me yet. :)<br/>
<br/>
Targeted or not, DoTs can complicate large scale situations.  If an<br/>
enchanter can&#39;t mes something because its DoT&#39;d the only recourse is to<br/>
charm it (not always a bad thing mind you).  I never target a mob manually<br/>
in those cases, we always have a main tank whom everyone assists off of -<br/>
however occasionally assist screws up by targeting a seemingly random mob<br/>
in the zone or it targets the wrong mob because of riposite.  I always<br/>
double or triple tap my /assist [main tank] hotkey just to make sure. <br/>
Besides, with VoV/fbss and Dawnchaser/Partisan I do excellent melee damage.<br/>
 Too bad there isn&#39;t &quot;+hitroll&quot; gear or I&#39;d be really dangerous.  LoS<br/>
really is a different type of guild, so feel free to disreguard what I<br/>
say... case and point:  a wizard pulls in poh for us or we go door to door<br/>
trick or treating the houses because its fun.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Hum oh yeah Shada: sure 7/33 will get old BUT in EQ making a fashion<br/>
statement is oh so imporant.  I&#39;m trying to remember, he had blue boots,<br/>
yellow legs/chest/arms and black head/wrists/gloves... that sound about<br/>
right?  Wolverine Woodelf here I come. :)<br/>
<br/>
And as for RoK issues: I guess its just a matter of perspective because if<br/>
the rolls where reversed I sure would want the stuff I see dropping and<br/>
probably would try and buy it - so I don&#39;t knock anyone who disagrees with<br/>
my contention it should be nodrop, etc... but I hope you can see the flip<br/>
side of that too.<br/>
