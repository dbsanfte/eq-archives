<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Back on-topic - &quot;Twisting&quot; songs... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614955356">I twist four songs.  I am occasionally able to get them all to remain constant effect.  Some songs appear<br/>
to last a few seconds longer than others - in the same twist, some will always remain constant, and some<br/>
will always drop.  I figure that it&#39;s better to have 3.5 effects going than 3, so even if all of them drop<br/>
for a bit, I figure I&#39;m doing better than 3 constant songs (which is easy for me).<br/>
<br/>
I optimize twisting by watching for the text messages (which is why SoS really, really irritates me, since<br/>
it HAS NONE), and getting into the rhythm.  I&#39;ve played long enough that I know how to adapt to varying<br/>
lag conditions.  I start a session by waiting for the text messages, then speed up just enough that the<br/>
song stops without canceling the prior one, but without having to wait for the message.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, I had memmed:<br/>
<br/>
Twilight<br/>
Lull (8)<br/>
Rondo<br/>
Nillipuss<br/>
Cantana<br/>
SoS<br/>
Chains (51)<br/>
Bellow (55)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s vaguely typical in a dungeon (although I may or may not have Lull, Nillipuss and/or Bellow memmed<br/>
depending on circumstances, SoS is more common, the other four are standard) , but it changes in the<br/>
various Planes, in outdoor groups, when soloing, and when traveling.<br/>
<br/>
When traveling, I usually set up to be able to take MOBs if I feel like it, so a sort-of-typical songlist<br/>
would be:<br/>
<br/>
Song of Travel<br/>
Fufil&#39;s<br/>
the two Tuyen&#39;s<br/>
Fear<br/>
Chains (51)<br/>
Cantana<br/>
Healing<br/>
<br/>
Kenross Cantoforjado, 58 songs, Innoruuk<br/>

&gt; &gt;However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  If I turn the<br/>
&gt; &gt;clipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent trade off<br/>
&gt; &gt;in viewable distance and twisting time.<br/>

&gt; Okay - to start another, on-topic, thread, I wanted to know a bit about<br/>
&gt; your success with &quot;twisting&quot; songs.<br/>
&gt; 1) How many songs can you twist at once - assuming constant effect songs.<br/>
&gt; 2) What do you do to optimize your twisting?<br/>
&gt; 3) What is your current playlist?  What do you sing in battle, and what out<br/>
&gt; of it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a few questions from a young-again bard<br/>
