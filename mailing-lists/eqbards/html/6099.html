Not a whole lot of info?  You&#39;re joking - that&#39;s priceless stuff.  These are<br/>
some of the Bard&#39;s major complaints that you and he have addressed here.<br/>
<br/>
Let me summarize -<br/>
<br/>
Q) There was recently a change made to the level 23 bard song - Selo&#39;s<br/>
Consanent Chain.  This song now will not effect MOBs that are SoW&#39;d.<br/>
A) That was an unintentional bug from fixing something else - it has hopefully<br/>
been fixed with this patch.<br/>
<br/>
Q) Why when I&#39;m playing my drum does it look like I&#39;m strumming a stick?<br/>
A) We lost an animation somewhere - hopefully it will be fixed when we do our<br/>
art patch.<br/>
<br/>
Q) Bard skills that are capped at 40 (forage, sneak, hide).  This limit is so<br/>
low that the skill is useless.<br/>
A) I&#39;ll check on that.<br/>
<br/>
Q) How about letting us know when our missing songs will be implemented?<br/>
A) There are very few that are not in - and they are waiting for something...<br/>

&gt; I recently sent Geoffrey Zatkin an email with a couple questions and gripes<br/>
&gt; about our class.  Nothing too major, just looking for some info.  To my<br/>
&gt; surprise, he sent me back a fairly prompt response.  I&#39;ve included my<br/>
&gt; original message, along with his comments below.  Not a whole lot of info,<br/>
&gt; but its something.<br/>
