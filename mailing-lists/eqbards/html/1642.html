&gt;I did some experimentation with invisibility last night at the big monolith<br/>
&gt;on the shore in North Karana.  It seems that with the song, I am also<br/>
&gt;invisible to undead ( zombies and skellies).  Of course if you have an<br/>
&gt;unlucky moment and become visible, then they all attack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I remember reading that invisibility did not work for undead.  Was this <br/>
&gt;only<br/>
&gt;for the mana user&#39;s version, or do higher lvl undead&#39;s see right through <br/>
&gt;it?<br/>

A friend and I (I&#39;m 21st he is 18th) had to zone to Lower Guk to escape a <br/>
froglok train. We were resting inside and I was using invis song while he <br/>
was afk. Shortly thereafter a high-level mage had to zone a Froglof Ghoul <br/>
Knight..nasty stuff. It sat there at zone-line right in front of me for <br/>
about 3 seconds after she escaped before it started attacking my friend. Why <br/>
not me? I&#39;m thinking maye because he is a paladin..not sure. Anyways, I am <br/>
pretty sure Shauri&#39;s Clouding is useless on higher level undead.<br/>
