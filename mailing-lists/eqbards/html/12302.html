&gt; Hmmm, sent that before I finished or wasn&#39;t clear or something.  The next<br/>

&gt; bubble.  It was definitely more than the visual lost xp when he dropped to<br/>
&gt; 30th by at least double.  Could be some distortion from the end of bar<br/>
&gt; decorations, but wouldn&#39;t think it was that much.    It definitely appeared<br/>
&gt; that he lost at least twice as much visible bubble space in pixels when he<br/>
&gt; dropped from 2 bubbles and didn&#39;t lose any 30th level xp as it did when part<br/>
&gt; of the xp loss came out of 30th.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But then you&#39;re trying to compare level 30 bubbles to level 31<br/>
bubbles, which is literally apples to oranges.  You have to<br/>
compare using the same units.  In my anecdote and my take on<br/>
your anecdote, it was level 30 bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
All you&#39;ve really shown is that level 30 bubbles are a lot<br/>
bigger than level 31 bubbles, which we already know since<br/>
level 30 a hell level.  :)<br/>
