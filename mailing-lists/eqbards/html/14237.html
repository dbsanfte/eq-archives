&gt; &gt;Yes, contrary to the &quot;difficulty&quot; ratings Verant gave each<br/>
&gt; &gt;class/race/diety, it is much much much easier for evil<br/>

&gt; I am able to enter Ogguk without problems when I use the<br/>
&gt; guise of deception. The Bouncers con indifferent and the<br/>
&gt; merchants inside con amiable. I am a agnostic woodelf btw.<br/>
&gt; I picked this because thats what I am. I use the DE<br/>
&gt; illusion everytime I run through Ferrot or is resting<br/>
&gt; outside CZ.<br/>

There are relatively easy (though time-consuming) ways to<br/>
become non-KOS to virtually all the good races.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone has figured out a way to raise your faction with the<br/>
