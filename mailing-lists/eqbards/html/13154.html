<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099449043"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The point wasn&#39;t whether or not I could tank an ice giant.  <br/>
&gt; Obviously I could since I survived.  The point was whether<br/>
&gt; it&#39;d be more effective to have a real tank tank it (at the<br/>
&gt; cost of losing his damage on the primary target).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ll rephrase.<br/>
<br/>
  If you pull multiple fire giants, when they are drowsied,<br/>
  even a bard can take hits from them with little or no problems.  <br/>
<br/>
  Real tank or not, Togors will produce extremely benefical <br/>
  effects when overpulling un-mezerable npcs.<br/>
<br/>
  That was my point.  You can then concentrate all tanks on one giant,<br/>
  and allbeit the bard will be attacked, he will not require the healing<br/>
  attention of the cleric to the extent you describe.<br/>
