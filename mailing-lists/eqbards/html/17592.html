caster needs to be sure of is that they&#39;ve scrolled off the agro list when<br/>
he sits down.  When my guild killed Dojorn last time, I simply cons&#39;d it<br/>
until it was indifferent again then sat down out of the AE rain spell&#39;s<br/>
range.  It only stayed agro on me for a couple of seconds after I cast a<br/>
heal.  And as for pure casters, they can&#39;t hit Dojorn anyways, so they<br/>
shouldn&#39;t even be casting.<br/>
