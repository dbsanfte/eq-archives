&gt;Ah, and since it was my original mistake, let me clarify the amulet is<br/>
&gt;actually called the Order of Thunder.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will test the thing tonight, since my charisma is only 90 without it.<br/>
&gt;Will greatly disapoint me if the added charisma boost actually doesn&#39;t help<br/>
&gt;in any way!  Was using it more in hopes of it helping songs somehow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One, of course, can store it in the bank if it is first placed in a bag.<br/>

remember back in P4 when the OOT amulet boosted CHA by 15. Verant decided it <br/>
was too much for such an easy to get item. I tried using the current version <br/>
of the amulet along with - this may sound funny - one of those &quot;gowns&quot; you <br/>
can buy in the Qeynos market. Well, it&#39;s either a gown or a blouse. I <br/>
forget, anyways it looks like a shirt, but it gives +5 Cha, and I don&#39;t know <br/>
if it&#39;s still available. It was pretty funny to be walking around with it on <br/>
and my buddies would make comments on it... (I kept having to defend myself, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not a transvestite bard, I SWEAR!!!&quot;). Anyways - they would shut up if <br/>
they wanted me to buy there equipment cheaper than they could ever hope for <br/>
from a merchant.<br/>
