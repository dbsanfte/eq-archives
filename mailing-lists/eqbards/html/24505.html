Avatar and Dance of the Blade.  The only spell I have found it will not<br/>
stack with is the ranger spell Call of the Predator.<br/>
<br/>
So far my highest attack rating has been 1260 w/ Avatar :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Khelkar Icepaw drops the lute. he is in the lower levels of <br/>
&gt; Velk&#39;s and is quite hard. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly right. I was in a group hunting &quot;the pit&quot; last <br/>
Friday, and we fought and killed Khelkar twice. On his second death, <br/>
he dropped the lute [which I was lucky enough to get.] (It is a rare <br/>
drop, though.)<br/>
<br/>
Both times we fought him, he was level 59. He was slain once with 12 <br/>
people, and once with 18. (18 was an overkill, though.) By the way, <br/>
the time we tried him with 6 resulted in 5 reses and a redo. *Grins*<br/>

Lute of the Howler<br/>
PRIMARY &lt;-- Can use an off-hand weapon with it.<br/>
Effect: Illusion Werewolf (+100ATT, +30STR, +40% Haste) <br/>
[I have not verified the haste %]<br/>
<br/>
Other Notes: <br/>
(1) You *can* stack the DE illusion over the WW illusion, and you get <br/>
the bonus of the WW, but look like a DE. I assume (not tested) other <br/>
illusions work as well. [I want to see if Boon stacks with it -- add <br/>
in another +100DEX.]<br/>
(2) Illusion WW is NOT the same as Boon<br/>
(3) I have not verified the % song increase, but I do know it is a <br/>
little less than my Seven String Lute, so (just guessing) I would <br/>
place it at about 15%.<br/>
(4) If you use the illusion much, start expecting requests for <br/>
clarity. *Grins*<br/>
