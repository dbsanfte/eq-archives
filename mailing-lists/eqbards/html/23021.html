<div id="ygrps-yiv-202590517">i thought dispels were unresistable, but certain spell effects had X number<br/>
of counters and you need to dispel X number of times to get them off.  but<br/>
the short answer is yes, both of our dispel songs removed effects on us<br/>
(positive or negative) other than illusions before patch.  i haven&#39;t tried<br/>
since.  i&#39;m not sure if it goes in order on your effects box or what order<br/>
they were cast on you or if it&#39;s random.  i thought they made it random<br/>
around the same type they made Vox and Nag AE dispel.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The problem with using our Cancel Magic song to remove spell <br/>
&gt; effects is that<br/>
&gt; it checks against your MR.  I think, but am not 100% certain, <br/>
&gt; that Cancel<br/>
&gt; Magic will always remove the first spell effect.  So if you <br/>
&gt; are rooted, in<br/>
&gt; order to get rid of it the root icon needs to be listed <br/>
&gt; first.  Then the<br/>
&gt; song has to actually succeed a MR check.  When I want to remove my DE<br/>
&gt; illusion, I usually have to try 2-3 times before the song sticks. </span></blockquote></div>
