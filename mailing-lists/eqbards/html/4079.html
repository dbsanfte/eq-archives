<div id="ygrps-yiv-298251604">Here is what I know about using the Mystic Clouding song:<br/>
<br/>
It works verses all creatures including undead (AND your fellow group<br/>
mates), HOWEVER, there are some creatures that can innately see<br/>
invisible...which ones those are, I do not know, but there are apparently<br/>
some that can.  (As a matter of fact, does anyone know which creatures in<br/>
the game can innately see invisible?)<br/>
<br/>
The strange behavior with the invis song is that if any member of the party<br/>
does ANYTHING to drop their invis like cast a spell, or are in Auto Attack<br/>
mode (whether actually attacking or not) and another mob targets them, then<br/>
that mob will see everyone else in the party regardless of whether they<br/>
appear to be invisible or not.  One member of your group on a monster&#39;s shit<br/>
list adds everyone in your group to that monster&#39;s shit list.<br/>
<br/>
Every tick of the invis song causes a skill check to be made and every now<br/>
and then a character will fail, and turn visible for a single tick, until<br/>
the next tick of the song and then they pop invisible again.  While this is<br/>
uncommon, it does happen, and during that tick of visibility, if you are<br/>
near enough to a mob to be noticed and targeted, invis is shot for the whole<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to fall under the group hate thing...where a bard singing Hymn is<br/>
&quot;helping&quot; the members of his party (like the puller for example) so the mob<br/>
targets the bard - just like when a cleric heals another group member it<br/>
often attracts the monster&#39;s attention.<br/>
<br/>
But all alone with the mino horn and a skill of 105 in wind I sang Clouding<br/>
and wandered all over the first 3 floors of the Unrest mansion invisible,<br/>
checking it all out...at one point the 2 hags from the basement walked RIGHT<br/>
past me through the hall and just about made my heart jump out my throat,<br/>
but did not see me at all.  This is a fun song to play with.<br/>

&gt; A similar thing happened to me twice when I was camping <br/>
&gt; behind the back<br/>
&gt; porch.  One time, my group was resting after a fight.  I had <br/>
&gt; been using<br/>
&gt; Denon&#39;s Discord during the previous fight.  While everyone is <br/>
&gt; resting, the<br/>
&gt; back door opens up and a festering hag makes a beeline <br/>
&gt; towards me.  Next<br/>
&gt; thing I know she zaps me for 300+ hit points and I&#39;m dead.  <br/>
&gt; If there is a<br/>
&gt; bug with the  axis whatever is it something that Verant is <br/>
&gt; aware of and is<br/>
&gt; working on fixing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;snipped from earlier post by Faras&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Last night in Unrest I camped off the side porch <br/>
&gt; because there was a<br/>
&gt; 	discussion that singing songs off the back porch might <br/>
&gt; be affecting<br/>
&gt; mobs in<br/>
&gt; 	the basement due to an unlimited Z axis affect bug.  I <br/>
&gt; also did not<br/>
&gt; stand<br/>
&gt; 	around and sing songs while our puller was in the <br/>
&gt; house...I waited<br/>
&gt; until our<br/>
&gt; 	kill was brought to the fence and whacked once or twice and then<br/>
&gt; kicked in<br/>
&gt; 	my playlist.  This worked awesome and I did not die once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t think the bards invis song worked against undead.  I <br/>
&gt; know for a<br/>
&gt; fact I have been attacked by zombies before while singing the <br/>
&gt; song.  Can<br/>
&gt; someone clarify this please.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I think the people I group with generally recognize <br/>
&gt; that I do a lot<br/>
&gt; as a	<br/>
&gt; 	bard, shuffling instruments and weapons, jumping in and out of<br/>
&gt; physical<br/>
&gt; 	melee, playing a variety of different songs, some <br/>
&gt; &quot;simultaneously&quot;<br/>
&gt; - and<br/>
&gt; 	they also recognize the benefit of our songs because I tell them<br/>
&gt; things like<br/>
&gt; 	&quot;check out your magic resist&quot; and get the &quot;wholly <br/>
&gt; crap!&quot; or invis<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; 	while they are medding and they are amazed that it works against<br/>
&gt; undead too.<br/>
&gt; 	Our party was sitting against the fence medding and watching a<br/>
&gt; Festering Hag<br/>
&gt; 	run around the yard wasting people, finally being <br/>
&gt; killed by a group<br/>
&gt; only 15<br/>
&gt; 	feet away from us - we watched the whole thing as the <br/>
&gt; group leader<br/>
&gt; nervously<br/>
&gt; 	commented &quot;don&#39;t stop singing that song Faras...&quot;<br/>
