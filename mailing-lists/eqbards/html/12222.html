&gt;Greetings Reed and welcome!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Will leveling get easier?  Hmmm - yes and no.  Each level higher you get<br/>
&gt;takes more xp imho.  Some levels are by design twice as hard as regular<br/>
&gt;levels - they are called the &quot;Hell&quot; levels: 30, 35, 40 and 45 (imho 50 is<br/>
&gt;the ultimate Hell as well) but the teens are real tough for bards as well.<br/>
&gt;But it can get easier if you get into groups and if you can form a team<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;plays together on a regular basis - it will be easier and more fun.  You<br/>
&gt;should find a guild that you like and that has players who play at your<br/>
&gt;level and at your same amount of time in the game.   The last time I was<br/>
&gt;able to do &quot;a level in a day&quot; was back at level 24 for me.  It was hard to<br/>
&gt;do even though I could always do it before if I set my mind to it and<br/>
&gt;endured long camps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But I hate camping too!  It&#39;s dull and boring for the most part.<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately, it is a pretty big part of the game as you get older.   Most<br/>
&gt;bards prefer to group and most groups will want to camp.  So, while it may<br/>
&gt;be possible to get to high levels without camping, I do think it would take<br/>
&gt;a lot longer and it would be a lot harder.  But you should play the game<br/>

&gt; I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player<br/>
&gt;(maybe a couple<br/>
&gt; hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be<br/>
&gt;taking longer...<br/>
&gt; Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it<br/>
&gt;take longer for<br/>
&gt; each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each<br/>
&gt;level, but<br/>
&gt; hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better<br/>
&gt;selection of<br/>
&gt; mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or<br/>
&gt;harder to level<br/>
&gt; in the early teens compared to later levels..<br/>
&gt; Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?<br/>
&gt;I hate<br/>
&gt; camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I<br/>
&gt;get bored and<br/>
&gt; leave....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
