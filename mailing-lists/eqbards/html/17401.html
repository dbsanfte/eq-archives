Btw, I understand your philosophical concerns, but isn&#39;t it the case <br/>
that:  1) an unscrupulous company could scan our disks anyway and most of <br/>
us would have no clue, 2) their proposed EULA did NOT give them <br/>
permission to look at anything that wasn&#39;t EQ-related, and 3) they&#39;re <br/>
much too sloppy and overburdened to go through the hassle which would <br/>
be required to actually make use of any other information?  I think you <br/>
give them too much credit if you think they&#39;re capable of doing anything <br/>
other than keeping their heads above water.<br/>

PS - Perhaps having to deal with a paranoid schizophrenic ex has made me <br/>
overly sensitive to conspiracy theories.  It&#39;s pretty hard to live in <br/>
this world when you distrust everyone&#39;s motives all the time.  Much <br/>
better just to distrust everyone&#39;s competence.  Works for me.<br/>
