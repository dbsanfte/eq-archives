<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422736911">I dont think it should be a bannable offense to point out the bugs in a<br/>
particular piece of code.  Sure if players camp for the bug and make it a<br/>
party, I as Verant or a GM might get kinda pissed, but those players<br/>
shouldnt be banned for seeing something you as a programmer might have<br/>
missed.  If anything I&#39;d toss a mean mob in there and mix it up a little<br/>
bit.  Verant needs people to point out the little things they missed, ya<br/>
have to with a world this big with this much code etc etc.  This isnt just<br/>
whining, people do whine all the time, I whined on my first boat crash, I<br/>
thought I lost my 20+days of time working on my first character, I whined<br/>
when my character dissappeared and then came back 2 lvls less.  In time I<br/>
got experience to learn that, &quot;they know, they know&quot; so I dont whine<br/>
anymore, and I try and make sure if I ever do a petition its very clean and<br/>
straight to the point.  Of course exploiting the bug and taking advantage is<br/>
different matter all together, you should play honorably and not use such<br/>
ways as this to gain your XP.  But banning them?  Thats a little extreme I<br/>
think.  Personally I&#39;d either fix the code (if possible), remove the code or<br/>
NPC, or put a randomily spawning sand giant there or some other nasty<br/>
critter to help change peoples minds from using it as an XP point.  EQ is a<br/>
vast game, I&#39;m sure many things can be exploited, from the trust you recieve<br/>
from others to quirks in the gaming code to the 2500 plat on Ebay for $250.<br/>
I suppose EQ isnt perfect after all eh?  But it sure is damn fun!<br/>

&gt; You DO realize that what you are describing, the trapping of a creature<br/>
and then<br/>
&gt; killing it without risk to yourself, is a bannable offense right?  That if<br/>
a GM<br/>
&gt; sees you doing it, the least that will happen is that you get a warning<br/>
and a<br/>
&gt; note on your account?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you didn&#39;t, I&#39;ll do you the favour of letting you hear it here first<br/>
instead<br/>
&gt; of from a GM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t a case of RPers whining, this is a case of you cheating,<br/>
whether you<br/>
&gt; knew it or not, or acknowledge it or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone who doesn&#39;t have a problem with what you did could only be a<br/>
cheater<br/>
&gt; themselves, as far as I could imagine.<br/>
