<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506989737"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 	Hehe, best?  Nah, bards/enchanters have the best job, as they have<br/>
&gt; the widest spell selection.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Not gameplay wise, but likability.  Everyone likes clerics, and<br/>
  why wouldn&#39;t they?  The fact that you get to stare at a wall all<br/>
  night doesn&#39;t balance the fact that you are needed so much, I guess<br/>
  I meant to say.  You have some of the most desired basic traits,<br/>
  yet you are like an outcast sitting in a corner.  I always try to<br/>
  make conversation with my cleric under those circumstances.  I&#39;ve<br/>
  got to imagine it&#39;s pretty damn boring.  In hate, there&#39;s like the<br/>
  &#39;Clerics Corner&#39; where they all sit facing away from battle, it&#39;s<br/>
  kinda funny, but sad at the same time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	According to him he &quot;picked the people he knew would win the<br/>
&gt; fight&quot;.  Unfortuantely his decision is going to be biased, no matter what,<br/>
&gt; since he knows his guildmates better than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Well, if you&#39;ve got clerics waiting outside and some groups without <br/>
  clerics, you&#39;d think the groups missing clerics would bawk about it.<br/>
  But if you&#39;re a big happy family, and you don&#39;t want outside help,<br/>
  well that changes the scenario, which is what I believed happened.<br/>
  3 bards went to Nagafen, 3 bards went to Vox.  It doesn&#39;t make sense<br/>
  to not utilize the people and evaluate the groupings.  It&#39;s not like<br/>
  I showed up late, I had been there the previous day too when we waited<br/>
  for Vox to spawn. =)  Hell, if you&#39;ve got bards, use em.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s funny that the first few groups went linkdead, and the secondary<br/>
  groups did the bulk of the work... well not funny, ironic.  Since those<br/>
  first groups were the &#39;chosen&#39; ones, and we were the rejects. =)<br/>
