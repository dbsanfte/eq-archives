<div id="ygrps-yiv-735052464"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 	Sure, CR is simple, and hate was broken, but you can&#39;t pull any<br/>
&gt; further, so why even bother?  Do I want to spend 3 hours trying to unstick<br/>
&gt; a bugged pet, thereby adding 3 hours to the time it takes to clear a<br/>
&gt; plane?  No thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Why bother?  Well, 5 houses is better than 0, imo.  That&#39;s roughly<br/>
  20 or so chances to get equipment.  Roamers do not drop equipment<br/>
  anymore (the percentage is so low that statement can be applicable)<br/>
  Secondly, it&#39;s something to do -- and people have been saying that<br/>
  the new Hate is not doable, which clearly isn&#39;t the case.  Do the<br/>
  bugged spite golems suck?  They sure do, once you encounter it your<br/>
  mission is over.  But you can still try up to that point, which was<br/>
  my point ;)  (If you are lucky, two wizards can IC the pet when it<br/>
  arrives, thus forcing the spite to create a new unbugged pet.  But<br/>
  this requires a full party sacrifice as you are rushed)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	Looking around Azarack island, it seems that the spawns are spaced<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I believe Vektor key&#39;d in and was instantly swarmed.  Many changes <br/>
  have been introduced in this new Sky version; I wouldnt doubt that<br/>
  Verant has increased the difficulty of the area to prevent players<br/>
  from getting too far before expansion.  Again, to my knowledge no<br/>
  server has gotten very far in Sky after the recent upgrade.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	One of the major failings I&#39;ve seen with non-LoD dragon raids is<br/>
&gt; that the invite have generally been to people &quot;45+&quot;.  Honestly, that&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; good enough.  The difference between 24 level 45+ people and 24 level 50<br/>
&gt; people is enormous.  If someone wants to organize a dragon raid, the<br/>
&gt; people who go should be restricted to 49+, and the number of people kept<br/>
&gt; under 30.  Make those * hard * caps, and resist the urge to invite<br/>
&gt; additional friends to come.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Well, I completely agree with you here, however I have almost no<br/>
  say in the matter when I see L44 rogues and L39 warriors at the<br/>
  events.  I also suggested that (from this list) people be required<br/>
  to have a certain degree of resistance or they would not be allowed<br/>
  to participate.  Again, very little control of the matter, since <br/>
  I&#39;m not a recognized leader on the server.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We&#39;ve done Vox twice recently with 1 bard.  I think our equipment<br/>
&gt; is getting to the point where bards are more of a bonus than a necessity.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That was my issue with resistances and where exactly a bard fits into<br/>
  the dragon picture.  In the end, bards are not necessary for dragon<br/>
  attacks, despite what Verant seems to believe.  While you will not<br/>
  break 200 resistance without a bard, does 200 mean anything more than<br/>
  150? more than 100?  Most planar gear is irrelevant to cold resist,<br/>
  most suits get one piece that gives +10, some with two bracers that<br/>
  give +5 to +7.  A warrior in full indo only gets +14 to cold.  The<br/>
  rings, the crown, the fork, the cloak, etc are what give the most<br/>
  significant contribution to cold, and then add the resist spell on top.<br/>
  A warrior is looking to have a base(25/35) + items(84) + spell.  So at<br/>
  most you are going to get around the 160-170 range sans bard.  Is that<br/>
  enough?  I dunno, I&#39;ve been in there with 230, didn&#39;t make much <br/>
  difference to me.  Yet, bard instruments drop from dragons, where <br/>
  honestly, bards are just kinda an afterthought nowadays even in <br/>
  groups who are not as decked out in cold gear.  They&#39;d rather have<br/>
  another cleric or another warrior in the bard slot.<br/>
<br/>
  This confusion over resistances is what Verant needs to dispel.<br/>
  I&#39;d like to feel useful during a dragon attack, but not if adding<br/>
  another 60 or so resistance isn&#39;t helping.  Or there may be a hard<br/>
  resistance cap that we don&#39;t know about it makes bards look less<br/>
  useful in the grand scheme.  We already know Verant screwed casters<br/>
  on the 200 wis/int limit.  How long did that go unmentioned while<br/>
  some wizards were boasting 230/240 int.  Oh btw, any int over 200<br/>
  is useless.  doh.  hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m willing to bet that there is the same thing at play here.<br/>
  We just don&#39;t know it yet.  I have yet to see for myself the<br/>
  impact of high resistance on dragons, though I would agree<br/>
  using it wont hurt me, I still want to know the formula involved<br/>
  with checking and using the resistance number in combat.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
