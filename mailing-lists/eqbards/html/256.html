<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694379310">Hey!<br/>
<br/>
This results are quite interesting. I am a level 15 bard and used to play<br/>
Jonthan&#39;s Warsong and Brusco&#39;s Bellow when soloing and Anthem de Arms /<br/>
Brusco&#39;s Bellow when fighting in team. <br/>
But now i&#39;m not sure if this is still the best combination, cause my<br/>
bellow does 8 dmg and I can start it just 2 times until i have to  restart the<br/>
buff song. Maybe it would have more effect to switch between Chords of<br/>
Dissonance and the buff song cause the damage made by Chords until I have to switch<br/>
back to the buff song would be higher than 16 points.<br/>
What do other bards think about that? What song combinations do you use<br/>
when fighting solo or in party?<br/>
