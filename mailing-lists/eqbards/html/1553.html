<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127536411">This seems to be one of the more popular low-level quest<br/>
items, so here&#39;s what I know about it thus far.<br/>
<br/>
The quest is located in Rivervale.  In the back of the<br/>
building with the bank, there is a marshall.  Talk to him and<br/>
he will start you on the path to beginning this quest.  You<br/>
may need to kill some monsters in Misty Thicket first to raise<br/>
your faction enough that he&#39;ll give you the quest though.<br/>
<br/>
To complete the quest requires you to kill a lot (a LOT) of<br/>
goblins and orcs and turn in their warbeads and belts.  After<br/>
you have turned in enough, the marshall will give you a squad<br/>
ring.  The numbers I&#39;ve seen tossed around are about 400<br/>
necklaces and/or 50 belts.  Killing Mooto is supposed to help<br/>
too, and killing Gunrich is supposed to hurt.<br/>
<br/>
The ring holds a single healing charge (80 or 85 hp).  You<br/>
activate it by targeting yourself, then right-clicking on the<br/>
ring.  I have not tried using it to heal someone else.  This<br/>
is not that useful once you get around L15-20 or so, but at<br/>
lower levels it, as someone on the monk list put it, &quot;could&#39;ve<br/>
saved my life like a million times.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To recharge the ring, take it to the cleric&#39;s guild.  In<br/>
Rivervale, the cleric guildmistress (Hendri Mcrubble or<br/>
something like that) recharges the ring.  Simply give her the<br/>
ring and she will return it charged.  I am told that any<br/>
cleric guildmaster/mistress will recharge it, though you may<br/>
need good faction with them first (see next paragraph).<br/>
<br/>
You do NOT have to have as much faction to recharge it as you<br/>
do to get the ring in the first place.  My bard bought a ring<br/>
and tried to get it recharged, and the guildmistress wouldn&#39;t<br/>
give it back.  My druid found his ring on the ground before he<br/>
started the quest.  Based on what the guildmistress said to my<br/>
bard, I tried asking for a heal first (she says something<br/>
about [healing] and [curing] if you hail her).  She refused<br/>
saying I wasn&#39;t trustworthy enough.  I started the quest,<br/>
killed a few goblins, and raised my faction with<br/>
GuardiansoftheVale a bit.  When I visited her and asked her<br/>
for healing again, this time she gave me a quest to get<br/>
piranha teeth (don&#39;t bother - it&#39;s broken since piranha don&#39;t<br/>
give teeth as loot right now).  I guessed that this meant I<br/>
had enough faction for her to like me, gave her the ring, and<br/>
she gave it back to me recharged.  My druid has used it and<br/>
recharged it about a dozen times so far in less than one<br/>
level.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
And now you know why people are always /auctioning &quot;Buying<br/>
Runnyeye warbeads and Deathfist belts&quot; in Misty Thicket.  :-)<br/>
I&#39;ll add that Misty Thicket is probably the nicest (and<br/>
safest) hunting grounds in the L1-12 range when it&#39;s not<br/>
crowded.<br/>
