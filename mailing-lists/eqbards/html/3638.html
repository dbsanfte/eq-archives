<div id="ygrps-yiv-974362771">Outdoor zones i would agree, especially as a bard, with sow or jboots,<br/>
running is easy.  but the higher you get the more you are in dungeons like<br/>
lower guk and solusek B.  not quite as easy to run, trust me.  your only<br/>
chance is a group gate out, which works a lot but not always.  i&#39;m not<br/>
disagreeing, you die less at later levels, but you still die more than i<br/>
think you know.<br/>

I&#39;m not saying you don&#39;t die I&#39;m saying you don&#39;t die near as often and if<br/>
you do there are so many more ways to get back quickly at high levels not to<br/>
mention you can also avoid death a lot easier. I also play a Necromancer and<br/>
with Journeyman Boots I basically never die for the most part. I died twice<br/>
yesterday before that it had been over two weeks before my last death. All<br/>
I&#39;m saying is that the bind issue is not that big of a deal especially at<br/>
high levels.<br/>
