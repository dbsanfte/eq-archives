<div id="ygrps-yiv-926471834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Why doesn&#39;t Lady Vox learn of this small horde of powerful adeventurers<br/>
&gt; ripping through her defenses, and grab her treasue and get the flock out<br/>
&gt; of there...  In addition when this small horde fails, why doen&#39;t she eat<br/>
&gt; the corpses to prevent a future attack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You jest, but believe it or not.  One guild (ala FoH) on our server<br/>
  was killing Vox every single night and raping her bad for tremendous<br/>
  loot.  When the head GM found out about it, he went into Vox&#39;s lair<br/>
  and shoo&#39;d her away before they got there.  (/kill Lady Vox)<br/>
<br/>
  As for eating the corpses, you try to pass 30 platemail suits and<br/>
  60 swords, staves, and (ouch) morning stars/maces.  As I recall,<br/>
  they dont make potions of Ex-lax for dragons.  ;p<br/>
