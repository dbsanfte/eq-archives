&gt; I&#39;ve been in a lot of groups lately that seem to believe that <br/>
&gt; drops should go to <br/>
&gt; the player who can best utilize them, with lottos if there is <br/>
&gt; some dispute over <br/>
&gt; who would reap the most benefit.  Not so curiously, they <br/>
&gt; rarely seem to believe <br/>
&gt; that a Bard can reap the most benefit from anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like jhenderson, i agree with you both here.  i wanted a ykesha as much as<br/>
the next guy, and i can use it and more importantly WOULD use it.  any group<br/>
just get the lotto rules before-hand so there are no surprises.  the biggest<br/>
problem is the robes winning ykeshas and sashes.  only two possiblities,<br/>
they&#39;re going to their twinks or getting traded.  so i guess the 3 types of<br/>
lottos are everyone in, only those who can use, or those that can use it<br/>
best.  just depends on what you&#39;re camping and what kind of group you are<br/>
in.<br/>
