<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089035198">I was in Chef/Bar/Armorer the other night (Chef, pulling from the others) with my recently-standard group<br/>
of Cleric, Paladin, Shaman plus a Mage and another Shaman.  We did great for four hours, the Cleric left,<br/>
we got a replacement Cleric who wanted to come down (I would have taken anything with that group, but that<br/>
was all that was at the zone).  She got down, saw there was no Enchanter, and gated!  We had to get<br/>
somebody else!  I got 3 blue bubbles in five hours.  Her loss.<br/>

&gt; more then the &#39;we have to have a healer&#39; types is the &#39;have to have a<br/>
&gt; chanter&#39; types.  Was in Sebilis the other night and we had blast in the<br/>
&gt; bar/armorer rooms. I was primary CC and we were doing great.  Group broke up<br/>
&gt; and the next group I was in spent the next two hours whining about how we<br/>
&gt; had to have and enchanter.  We could have easily gone down and rebroken the<br/>
&gt; bar/armorer area, but instead did Gangrenous *yawn*.<br/>
