 </span></blockquote>My ranger character (my bard is still stuck at 17th) had a good night about<br/>
a month ago. I was in Steamfont collecting micro servos for a Trueshot bow<br/>
when the Mino hero pops and starts killing the under 10 crowd around the<br/>
caves. I was 39 at the time so I have SoW and figure I&#39;ll try kiting him. I<br/>
got him to 1/2 health but I was nearly out of arrows and figured I might<br/>
need to drop him on a guard when a 44th level druid swoops in and offers to<br/>
help. Within 30 seconds there&#39;s a dead mino and the druid doesn&#39;t want any<br/>
part of the shackle. I couldn&#39;t believe my good fortune. I needed to get off<br/>
at that point but I made a point to go to Greater Faydark to celibrate my<br/>
druid savior (he was a woodelf so I figured to do it in his home zone)<br/>
<br/>
I go and buy 9 bottles of something expensive, not sure what wine it was<br/>
then setup by the newbie lift. I /rollplay and begin to shout my story to<br/>
the zone. Finally near the end I call out to a first or second season (I<br/>
didn&#39;t even use level and circle doesn&#39;t seem right for non-casters) ranger<br/>
and druid to come to the top of the lift to drink a toast in the name of my<br/>
savior. I didn&#39;t say I was going to give them a Mino axe, buffs and maybe<br/>
some coin, I think I had a FS Scim for the druid, so you can imagine the<br/>
reaction ... nothing. I shouted for several more minutes and finally got a<br/>
2nd level ranger. I gave him the axe, buffed him as well as I can and gave<br/>
up, selling the extra wine back to the vendor.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt; at least I now have a Hero Bracers<br/>
