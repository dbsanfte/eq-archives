<div id="ygrps-yiv-279050062">Greetings and Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
You can go to www.onelist.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a>&gt;  and read it in the<br/>
daily archives.  By now, you may know form the context of the other replies,<br/>
the tip was kill everything (all the low level trash mobs too) to make more<br/>
hill giants spawn on the hill giant plateau in the Rathe Mts.  They are<br/>
using the charm song to make hill giants kill each other. <br/>

		hello all <br/>
		I am new to the list (like the last few days)...and<br/>
unfortunately I<br/>
		think I missed this message that he is referring to saying<br/>
thanks for<br/>
		the tip.  would someone be so kind as to repeat it or even<br/>
send it to<br/>
		me privately?  I would be most interested as I love to fight<br/>
in the<br/>
		Rathe mountains but I have yet to ever make that kind of<br/>
money....what<br/>
		are you doing?  As well I should point out that I am a druid<br/>
but I just<br/>
		started a bard and I love her.  she just made level 6 and I<br/>
think that<br/>
		the best thing about being a bard is having something to<br/>
look forward<br/>
		to at each level instead of every 5 like most classes.  I<br/>
thank you all<br/>
		for your indulgence.<br/>
