<b>Subject:</b> Binding or not... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-522040265">Hiya,<br/>
Just skimmed through 4xdigests.. Reading most about binding and skipping all the<br/>
melee&lt;-&gt;caster class msgs.<br/>
I must say that many of you have made some pretty good arguments about binding<br/>
or not. as stated in my last letter here I dident feel the need for bards or<br/>
other melee/combo-classes to be able to bind themselves. I still dont see that<br/>
need as my number one (or teenth for that matter) wish, and I from what I gather<br/>
what (most) people want is just the ability to be bound the same places as those<br/>
who can bind themselves?<br/>
On that I still dont quite agree, but maybe a slight increase in bindspots or<br/>
shortcuts to the most distant zones could come into question, but really as<br/>
things are now, I will be bold and say that well if you really feel the need to<br/>
be able to be bound anywhere, play a class that can bind. If you cant live<br/>
without the bind spell, then a bard, warrior, ranger, shadowknight, paladin,<br/>
rogue is properly not your kind of class.<br/>
Let us morons who dont mind running the 1208402 (or 2-3 which is much more<br/>
common) zones to get our corpse play the other classes. I still think that I can<br/>
get to almost any zone within a reasonble amount of time (even getting a<br/>
teleport is not that difficualt as the servers mature). And getting a bind have<br/>
almost never been more than 10 mins wait  (Erud still exepted) and during my<br/>
primetime hours the servers are half empty (20:00 is around 12:00 in the<br/>
states), maybe I&#39;m just plain lucky.<br/>
<br/>
So bottom line for me is. Aslong as the classes are so balanced that enough<br/>
people choose to play all them and arent forced to choose their class based on<br/>
the fact that its the only way to survive. I dont think that Verant should<br/>
change the way bind or anything else works. I also think that the fact that all<br/>
classes bitch and moan so much over they cant do this or that is a pretty good<br/>
indication that the classes are pretty well balanced.<br/>
So getting me to sign a petition demanding all to be able to get bound anywhere<br/>
is only going to happen if the the server pop. is getting an overweight of full<br/>
casters because people cant handle running through zones. IMO this must be the<br/>
indication of how balanced the classes is:<br/>
do enough people play them? if not what is wrong? and how do we correct it? I am<br/>
sure that Verant are keeping a tight eye on how the class/races develop on the<br/>
different servers. I know I would if I was developer. Not that I mind people<br/>
shouting about what they think are wrong though, keeping Verant on their toes is<br/>
a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well my ramblings is over for now.. and no I dont play 24/7 nor am I paid by<br/>
verant ;o) Just really happy with the game as it is.<br/>

P.S. the petition (or letter which i prefer to call it) to GZ is looking good to<br/>
me  :o)<br/>
P.P.S Okay so my english suck... Shot me.. Better to have you guys do it than my<br/>
boss for sitting here at work mailing to eqbards, hehe</div>
