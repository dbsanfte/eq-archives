<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526563445">Got a note on this from GZ, via another high level monk.  The way Verant<br/>
described it was the way FD was supposed to be working prior to the patch.<br/>
There was a bug in the code that caused it to work not as Verant thought it<br/>
did, but as Yeti and others had observed it to.  According to GZ after the<br/>
next patch it will work 100% below level 35 totally and as reported after<br/>
that, IF there are no other bugs in the code that are in effect.  <br/>
<br/>
He also said interestingly that the reason it did not work before the patch<br/>
as advertised was that the code for them forgetting was supposed to be an<br/>
exact copy of the code for forgetting a mob that had hopelessly outrun them<br/>
(as we often see in effect in w karana with bandits).  The code however was<br/>
copied before they fixed the bug in the code for outrunning and the<br/>
corrected outrunning code was never pasted back into FD.  So the answer is<br/>
basically yes, Yeti is right, and Verant thought they were right and only<br/>
discovered they were not when they found the bug in the previous code.<br/>

I am reposting this from the Monk MB <br/>

I have known Yeti since Beta 3 (when he was known as Orcus).  He is one of <br/>
the most knowledgable players I have every met in the game.  The upcoming <br/>
nerf to Feign Death will effect all players, not just Monks, Shadow Knights,<br/>
<br/>
and Necros.<br/>
<br/>
*********************************************<br/>
I would like to provide the community with information so they can <br/>
understand the nature of Verant&#39;s changes to FD. The changes are <br/>
significant, a nerf, and their news message was misleading.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you.&quot; - No, <br/>
they came back based on aggro radius. If you saw them wander away to a safe <br/>
distance, you could get up without training anyone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If not, they would come after you at some later point. This might happen <br/>
within a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later&quot; - This was not<br/>
<br/>
random, but the result of game mechanics understood by experienced feigners.<br/>
<br/>
A feigned upon mob has you in its aggro list. If someone else re-aggros the <br/>
mob to a lesser degree than the original feigner, it will return to the <br/>
feigner. Feigners knew this! If the mobs were in front of them in a room, <br/>
they knew no one would disturb them and all was fine. If the mobs were <br/>
scattered around the dungeon by a train wandering home, they knew to zone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;.... Four times means about 20 percent ....&quot; - These numbers seem totally <br/>
inaccurate. I had to feign 11 times on a green guard and 10 times on a <br/>
knight while testing in Freeport. If ANY of your feign attempts fails (xxxx <br/>
has fallen to the ground) then the mob comes running back. NO OTHER SKILL <br/>
takes 4 or more successful skill checks in a row to perform a single act. If<br/>
<br/>
you have multiple mobs, it is almost impossible to fool them all. If even <br/>
one is not fooled, it will build a train as it runs to you - quite possibly <br/>
from so far out of sight that you don&#39;t even know you are killing other <br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
Feign used to be predictable. If you were successful against a mob that can <br/>
be fooled (some couldn&#39;t be - this was a matter of experience and feigners <br/>
knew which mobs to avoid), it would never come back unless re-aggroed by <br/>
another player. Verant implies otherwise, but it is NOW that the skill is <br/>
totally unpredictable, with mobs that are far out of sight deep in the <br/>
dungeon randomly returning, based on percentages apparently much worse than <br/>
those Verant gave and which are useless against multiple mobs. Stand up, and<br/>
<br/>
a feigner doesn&#39;t know if he is killing people far out of sight, or has <br/>
safely cleared aggro.<br/>
<br/>
Before a player had to re-aggro a mob in such a way that the feigner was <br/>
still higher on its aggro list (such as by coming very close, but doing no <br/>
damage), and in this case it was usually only the feigner that was in <br/>
danger. Now every time a feigner stands up mobs can come training from <br/>
everywhere, and if he feigns again because he sees them coming, they will <br/>
attack anyone nearby or in their path home.<br/>
<br/>
Feign pulling is still possible, although harder. Feign twinking/leveling <br/>
others is still possible, and should actually be easier. Feigning to avoid <br/>
death or trains now results in far more trains. What are these &quot;evolving <br/>
gameplay issues&quot; that Verant hoped to address? In what way was this supposed<br/>
<br/>
to make this a better game?<br/>
<br/>
I ask that the EQ community understand this is not just a nerf to SKs, <br/>
Necromancers, and Monks, but to anyone that has ever grouped with them or <br/>
even played in a dungeon, and invite you to provide /feedback in game to <br/>
voice your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for listening, Yeti (Level 50 monk, Karana server)<br/>
