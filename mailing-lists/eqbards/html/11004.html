I am currently dual weilding Obsidian shards. This gives me two decent (6/25) weapons, that both proc a 30<br/>
point damage.<br/>
<br/>
One problem is that these weapons cause more taunting with my songs than a lvl 26 Warrior I hunt with. =)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been having stamina problems duel wielding an obsidian scimitar and a<br/>
&gt; dragoon dirk in long battles.  I&#39;m currently trying to figure out what to<br/>
&gt; replace the scimitar with, but I&#39;m not all that sure of the trade value of<br/>
&gt; it.  I&#39;ve got an offer on the table of a Silvery War Axe for the Obsidian<br/>
&gt; Scimitar.  Is this a good trade?<br/>
