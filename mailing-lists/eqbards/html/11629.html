<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393518869">it shows the older items.  my friend accidentally sold his mortificator<br/>
staff to an npc.  this is the only one we know of on our server, he got it<br/>
in a GM event.  i did not hear until about a week later, and he was still<br/>
upset about it.  i told him i heard if you go buy all of the items from the<br/>
list it will eventually pop up.  and it worked, he got the staff back, but<br/>
he had to buy a bunch of stuff for it to show up.  AND he even killed the<br/>
vendor after he sold it, but when he repopped he still had the staff buried<br/>
beneath all the junk.<br/>

&gt; Until its sold.  How are the pawn items determined?  Does it show<br/>
&gt; the first items sold to the NPC or the latest items?  I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; sure on this.<br/>
