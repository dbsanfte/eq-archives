&gt;<br/>
&gt;Note: Lambent stones are useful for more than just bards.<br/>
&gt;You can turn one in for a GOOD magical 1hand blunt<br/>
&gt;staff that anyone can use. The Darkwood Staff<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This could be affecting your ability to get someone to give<br/>
&gt;you one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You also have to find out how much the merchants will give you<br/>
&gt;for one if you sell it to them. IF it is on the order of multiple<br/>
&gt;platinum, that may be another reason people are unwilling to sell cheaper<br/>
&gt;to you. You have to beat the market for it.<br/>
