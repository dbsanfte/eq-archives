It was me that said that the lizzies can&#39;t see invis.  I have *never ever*<br/>
been attacked in Cazic-Thule while I was invis.  This assumes, of course,<br/>
that I&#39;m not already aggro to something when I went invis.  Most often when<br/>
I go invis I&#39;ve zoned in /shouted for a group and been told to come to TR or<br/>
Archon.  I fire up Clouding by the zone and run to the Archon.  No problems<br/>
so far, but I&#39;m fighting less there nowadays.<br/>

&gt; p.s. I&#39;ll drag your corpse to behind the tree in the<br/>
&gt; Court Yard while<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; tell me again about how none of the Lizzies in here<br/>
&gt; can see invs...<br/>

&gt; Hey, I didn&#39;t say they couldn&#39;t see invis, but they<br/>
&gt; conned indifferent, and then... whack. 3 fanatics, one<br/>
