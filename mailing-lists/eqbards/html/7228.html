&gt; On the other hand they make some NPC&#39;s impossible kill.  There is a<br/>
&gt; developing storyline quest starting up in Neriak with an NPC claiming to be<br/>
&gt; the Daughter of Innoruk (sp?).  I have read several reports that groups have<br/>
&gt; attacked this NPC and been unable to inflict no damage at all even though<br/>
&gt; she is a green con.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am on The Rathe, and i have withness the arrival of Daughter of Innoruk.<br/>
<br/>
I was on my way back from Solusek Eye (God i love that dongeon), and in the<br/>
common land, outside the Nectulos forest, a Evil group where going to Befallen<br/>
to retreave a armor piece for the Daughter.<br/>
<br/>
As always, over guildsay and all, Every lvl 50 or so where there to try to take<br/>
a piece of her. Not only they did no damage, But she was calling over the &quot;Power<br/>
of Innoruuk&quot; to insta-kill them... Not nice to see lvl 50 drop in one cast.<br/>
<br/>
No Spell can hurt her, but it can be charmed ! If you can charm and command the<br/>
daughter of a god, does that make you a god ?<br/>
<br/>
Was funny to see the Daugter of Innoruuk sit while everyone that where slashing<br/>
on her just stop. Don&#39;t worry, i only did it twice, did not want to upset the<br/>
&quot;Power of Innoruuk&quot; (And the GM).<br/>
<br/>
ps : Fear and Chain also work on gm-npc.<br/>
