weapon?<br/>
<br/>
Not sure where you&#39;re at, but here&#39;s some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
1) From your message it sounds like you also want experience. If not you<br/>
can kill every orc pawn in east and west commons. Cloth armor and weapons.<br/>
<br/>
2) Paw is an excellent source for weapons(5s - 2.5gp), cloth armor (1-4gp)<br/>
and occasional shields (8gp) AND experience.<br/>
<br/>
3) Giant snakes, giant rattle snakes and asps. These are a source of giant<br/>
snake fangs (4-5gp). You might want a cleric along on this one. :)<br/>
<br/>
4) Steamfont. Harpies and skeletons and minos.<br/>

Hello fellow loremasters!<br/>
<br/>
Due to my recent adventures with the rogue Evil Eye and resulting loss of<br/>
my only decent weapon I find a desperate need to acquire wealth.  Could<br/>
anyone offer any suggestions for a 10th level, sigh was 11th once, bard to<br/>
really earn some coin?  I have found it difficult to make much as most of<br/>
the critters I get xp from are terribly cash poor in terms of loot<br/>
available.  I have a monk friend so can take on stuff slightly more<br/>
powerful than I alone. All suggestions welcomed!<br/>
<br/>
wait...almost all...if someone shouts kill snakes I think I&#39;ll scream...<br/>

       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>
     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,<br/>
        and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
oops, looks like I&#39;ll be working for money, kust more proof the world&#39;s not<br/>
perfect };-)<br/>
