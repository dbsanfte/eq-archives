[PREXUS-LEVEL 14 BARD]<br/>
<br/>
For me at least.  One day I was really bored and decided to do the Shining<br/>
Star of Light quest.  Sure its Cleric/Paladin only, but what they heck I<br/>
figured, maybe I could get something for it.  Time goes by and it starts to<br/>
gather dust.<br/>
<br/>
One day while running to Quenos I see an auction in N. Karana..<br/>
...&quot;For trade, Polished Granite Tomahawk, Mistmoor Battle Drums&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My heart skipped a beat and quickly went dead when I realized that I was a)<br/>
broke and b) probally not going to have anything a Level 50 Druid would<br/>
want, but being a masochist I sent her a tell.  Polite snickering could be<br/>
envisioned as I went from offering a few things, to all my bronze etc. Still<br/>
no deal.<br/>
<br/>
A while later I remember my SSOL.  I propose it to her as &quot;Im sure you<br/>
probally wont be interested, but if you have a Cleric/Paladin friend, maybe<br/>
they would like this..&quot;  Remarkably she replies that the SSOL is indeed an<br/>
item of worth and while she doesnt need it, she will check with her guild.<br/>
(Translation to me: I ask, but probally no).<br/>
<br/>
Three days go by and I see her online, &quot;Hello, I am the Bard who spoke with<br/>
you the other day.  I was curious if you had spoken with your guild, and if<br/>
you would like to trade the Drums for the SSOL.&quot;  ..I then began to await<br/>
the rejection.<br/>
<br/>
But lo and behold she said she would trade!  We met in the W. Commonland<br/>
Druid ring and traded.  I equipped it, and ZOOOOM!!!!! Off I went, wow, I am<br/>
still amazed at the speed.  At 13 I can outrun people in JBOOTS, and have<br/>
outrun people with SOW.  Its absolutely amazing how much ground I can get.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thats my tale.. hope it was entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. To date I have been able to save myself and 3 other people in<br/>
situations where SELO alone wouldnt have done it.<br/>
