(if you stop/start to get the messages more frequently, you<br/>
only get mana at the equivalent rate of just leaving the song<br/>
playing - 1 pulse every 6 sec).  So if you have a decent<br/>
connection, you can keep Hymn and Clarity going without<br/>
affecting Clarity at all.  Since you don&#39;t need to keep Hymn<br/>
refreshed as often as Clarity, what I usually do is let<br/>
Clarity tick twice (9 sec), give a shot of Hymn (3 sec) and go<br/>
back to Clarity.  That&#39;s enough to keep the Hymn effect and<br/>
icon on, while minimizing the chance of disrupting Clarity<br/>
(due to missed notes).<br/>
<br/>
Besides, my druid friend is a manastone junkie.  She keeps<br/>
regeneration on herself, and wants me to play both Clarity and<br/>
Hymn on top of that.<br/>
