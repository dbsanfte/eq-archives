<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096110004">Yeah right, I spent 10 hours at the Frenzied on sunday and only saw 1 sash<br/>
(a sash had dropped 30 minutes before I joined). It was most annoying<br/>
though, was hoping to get the sash for my friend but no such luck. I prefer<br/>
my TBB to the sash.<br/>
<br/>
Although spending all that time camping in Guk over the weekend got me out<br/>
of hell (yippee). And I am now 1.5 bubs into 41. The best part of the<br/>
weekend was when my guild helped me camp the Hooded Black Cloak, we got to<br/>
the camp and after killing the PH he spawned next time round, I looted and<br/>
there it was, a glorious HBC. That made my weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I also did my first proper Fire Giant run on Saturday night, our guild and<br/>
another guild combined and agreed to share the named spawns, our guild<br/>
would have the loot from Skarlon and the other guild could have the other 2<br/>
(Tranix and Rokyl I think). The guild agreed that one of our senior guild<br/>
members (50 paladin) should get the Mithril arms that dropped so he was<br/>
delighted. Only 1 hiccup when we pulled 4 Giants (lost about 5 people). I<br/>
managed to survive the entire night without dieing so that was nice for me,<br/>
I don&#39;t think I even took that much of a beating (never went below half<br/>
health even though I was meleeing).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, great weekend for me. Hope everyone else had a good one.<br/>

In 12 hours frenzi dropped 9 sashes, 4 back to back.<br/>
Either the random number generator got a 12 hour case<br/>
of the hiccups or Verant messed up when they changed<br/>
it to lore.  We even had a GM witness 2 of the back to<br/>
back drops (#3 and #4).  I guess it *could* have been<br/>
chance, but anyone else have a similar experience<br/>
since the change?<br/>
<br/>
My guess is emergency patch on Monday. :P<br/>
