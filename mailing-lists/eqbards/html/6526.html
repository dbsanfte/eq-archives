&gt; &gt; have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across Norrath to get the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amen.  My rather emotionally stable bard has been carrying around a Human Head for<br/>
two months.  Some guy walked up to me and gave it to me, so I figured the safest<br/>
thing to do, was thank him & walk quickly away. Well now it&#39;s no drop, & I can&#39;t<br/>
figure the quest this lore item goes to.  I&#39;ve gone to the Tox Forrest to see if<br/>
it&#39;s the poacher quest, but no....now I have 2 no-drop heads.....<br/>
<br/>
Please Verant, allow us to put no-drops into the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Also if anyone has any info on what this head may be used for....My poor character<br/>
is losing it trying to figure out if this is a D elf chain letter, or if she<br/>
should just do the Norrath impression of Joe Pessi and wander around w/ &quot;8 Heads<br/>
in a Duffle&quot;.  (For the truly morbid, there are easily enough quests to make this<br/>
possible....I&#39;ve checked)</div>
