<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473948389">Okay - it seems like the topique du jour: &quot;To Plate or not to Plate - that<br/>
is the question!&quot;  From what I&#39;ve seen so far in this conversation - this is<br/>
just something we&#39;ll all have to just agree that we disagree.  Most people<br/>
have their minds made up and nothing anyone is going to say will likely<br/>
change anyone else&#39;s mind..<br/>
<br/>
Next I&#39;d like to point out - that I am uncomfortable with the idea the<br/>
Powergaming vs. role-playing is an either-or-situation.  I see them as two<br/>
extremes with most people (like myself) in the middle.  I think talking with<br/>
&quot;thees&quot; and &quot;thous&quot; is silly (you are arbitrarily picking a period of speech<br/>
which is way after the medieval period anyway!  The people that talk that<br/>
way sound more like Pilgrims than Beowulf if you ask me!)  Also - if things<br/>
are slow - I like to talk to people OOC - find out where they are from what<br/>
they do for a living, etc<br/>
<br/>
I started the week the game out and I&#39;m at level 15...  I do NOT consider<br/>
myself a power-gamer.  I kind of consider the way I play<br/>
reverse-role-playing in a sense - my character becomes and extension of my<br/>
own personality etc.  I DO believe in playing the game the way the designers<br/>
meant it to be played.  I take no pre-conceived notions of what a bard<br/>
should be except what is presented to me by the game.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand  I see no reason not to wear Plate and eventually I&#39;m sure I<br/>
will.  On the other hand - I don&#39;t see it as an end to end to itself.  I&#39;m<br/>
not going to rush to try to be the first level 50 bard wearing a full set of<br/>
magic plate (or whatever) on my server.  I won&#39;t even care if I&#39;m the last.<br/>
I also don&#39;t write songs or poems for the game.  I hardly have enough time<br/>
to write songs for my real-life band (the professional not ammeter type).<br/>
<br/>
Okay - with all that said - I&#39;d like to change this conversation a bit.<br/>
We&#39;ve agreed to disagree (well, I have at least).  But what isn&#39;t clear to<br/>
me in most of the conversations by those against plate - whether you are<br/>
saying YOU won&#39;t wear plate - Vs NO ONE should wear plate - i.e. Verant<br/>
should change the code of the game to not allow ANY bards to wear plate.  If<br/>
that is your opinion - please state it and explain why.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a flamer - I am genuinely interested in your side of the issue and<br/>
am curious to hear the arguments.<br/>

&gt; &gt;From what I&#39;ve seen the bards in Everquest are nothing like the &quot;bards&quot;<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the celtic tribes as you describe them here.  The bards of everquest<br/>
travel,<br/>
&gt; sing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>
&gt; which you said the celts were not.  I could handle bards wearing chain in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; roleplay situation, however, not plate.  This is my opinion, and I feel<br/>
both </span></blockquote></div>
