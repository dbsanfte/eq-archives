<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585923780">I have a CH F-16 Combat Stick and CH Prothrottle (www.chproducts.com<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chproducts.com">http://www.chproducts.com</a>&gt;  to see what this stuff looks like).  The<br/>
joystick (now gathering dust), throttle & your keyboard get cabled together<br/>
and plugged in to your PC.  The throttle/stick combo has some programmable<br/>
memory of some sort inside and dozens of buttons & switches on the outside.<br/>
They have &quot;editior&quot; programs that allow you to customize which ascii or<br/>
keyboard code(s) get sent when you click the button or hat switch. <br/>
<br/>
On my throttle (game controller) I have one of the 4 four-way hat switches<br/>
set for forward & back movement and right and left turning.  In the editor,<br/>
I told the game controller to send kp-8 (key pad 8 code) and an ascii 5<br/>
(like typing the &#39;5&#39; to fire the item in current hot key 5 slot.) So, on my<br/>
movement hot key pallette I put a &quot;sense heading&quot; button in hot key 5.  Now<br/>
when I move the hat for forward or back, it sends a kp-8 to move and &#39;5&#39; to<br/>
fire hot-key 5 which for normal movement is &#39;sense heading.&#39; On hot key<br/>
palette 4, slot 5 has a /corpse &#39;social&#39; button, so when I move (I pulse<br/>
movement) it drags the selected corpse - mine usually.<br/>
<br/>
In my case, I don&#39;t use the joystick but use the programmable throttle<br/>
(although the stick still needs to be hooked up for every thing to work.)  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

p.s. Here&#39;s a clip from a friend that has a slightly different set up:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Personally, I use the WASD/Trackball combo that has been ingrained in me<br/>
ever since Quake 1. I have to use the Mouselook function because I feel<br/>
funny looking over the tops of gobbie heads while I&#39;m whacking &#39;em. The<br/>
circle strafe is handy in fights to maneuver around to the backside of the<br/>
MOB for those fun games of &quot;Spin the Gobbie.&quot;<br/>
