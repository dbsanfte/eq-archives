<div id="ygrps-yiv-259059017">No big secret as to what burned out lightstones are for. There is a practice <br/>
research item that allows finger wigglers to build up their research without <br/>
wasting rare research componets.  And one of the practice runes requires a <br/>
Burned out lightstone.  So most likely he was handing the person with the <br/>
burned out lightstone the practice research book with all the components in <br/>
it (except for the BO lightstone).  The person with the lightstone places it <br/>
in the container and hits combine(no research skill it needed for this part) <br/>
then hands the rune and container back to buyer. :)<br/>

&gt;Hello Fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t you think that the Burned Out Lightstones are NO DROP<br/>
&gt;like any other NO DROP Items that are Quest related? Although<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know and I&#39;m not sure, I think there is a Quest for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While traveling at full speed in West Common somebody was<br/>
&gt;buying the Burned out lightstones... Yes BUYING... He said<br/>
&gt;that he knew they were NO DROP but said there was a way to<br/>
&gt;transfer them anyway. So why would a guy go thru all that trouble<br/>
&gt;for useless items? Anyone have an idea?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To say that all those Lightstones messages started with my Elf Hide<br/>
&gt;Gloves question where I used the Wisp as an example ;-)<br/>
