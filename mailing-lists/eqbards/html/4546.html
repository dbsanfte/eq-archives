<div id="ygrps-yiv-245149359"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well the flip side of this is that as you go from level 1 to<br/>
&gt; 25, you&#39;d gain str and wis, maybe dex and sta.  But as you<br/>
&gt; went from 25 to 50 you&#39;d lose str, dex, sta, agi, and maybe<br/>
&gt; int while gaining wis.  There are actually systems that do<br/>
&gt; this, usually coupling older (decreased stats) with wiser<br/>
&gt; (more skills) and vice versa.  But that&#39;s beyond the scope of<br/>
&gt; this list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way I&#39;d look at it would be that level 50 is (currently) the &quot;prime&quot; of<br/>
a player. The player is the best they can be so to speak. So this would be<br/>
the prime time of their life. The same would go to 75 if that&#39;s what the cap<br/>
was raised to. I don&#39;t agree with the curve from low at 1 to high at 25 to<br/>
low at 50 again. 50 is when you&#39;re at your peak so to speak in my opinion.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying people should be able to raise their skills to<br/>
uncomprehendable numbers with skill points, but they should be able to raise<br/>
them to their natural maximums over time.</div>
