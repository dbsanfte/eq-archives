<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595349535">Brad McQuaid&#39;s title is Producer.  He&#39;s top dog in terms of anything done to<br/>
or with the game.  It&#39;s his baby, his brainchild, his labor of love.<br/>
Everyone else of course feels the same way, but Brad is the man truly<br/>
responsible for this game&#39;s creation.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, while he can do anything he wants in the game, pretty much, he<br/>
generally doesn&#39;t.  He has regular anonymous play characters on several<br/>
servers,  much like the rest of us, and plays regularly.  You may have<br/>
grouped with him and never known it.<br/>
<br/>
He only dusts off and puts on his Aradune persona when he&#39;s acting in an<br/>
official capacity, or in the singular case of Vox&#39;s demise, when he wanted<br/>
to join in on some fun.  A lot of folks gave him flack for that, but his<br/>
presence didn&#39;t effect the Vox&#39;s fate.  She was doomed from the start.  Oh,<br/>
and Aradune is a Ranger, not a Paladin.  Don&#39;t let the green plate mail<br/>
throw you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this is off-topic to this thread, but in response to someone who felt<br/>
&#39;twisting&#39; (BTW, 10 free brownie points if you can point me to the person<br/>
that coined that term...and an evil and painful death for him..I really<br/>
dislike it) was an exploit.<br/>
<br/>
Cycling bard songs is part of what bards do, it&#39;s a feature, and all the<br/>
song designs reflect that ability.  If any one song was more than a cantrip<br/>
in power, it&#39;d be a different issue, but that&#39;s not the case.  Bard songs on<br/>
the whole are very mild in effect, singularly and per verse, but potent<br/>
combined and over time.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the way it should be, and any bard who is not &#39;twisting&#39;, has failed<br/>
to realize the potential of the class.  It&#39;d be the same as playing a<br/>
warrior who doesn&#39;t use weapons, a wizard who never memorizes spells, a<br/>
ranger that doesn&#39;t track, a shadowknight that doesn&#39;t harm touch, a mage<br/>
that doesn&#39;t use pets, etc.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;One question I have...Isn&#39;t Aradune to paladins what JM (on this list) is<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bards??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If what I have heard is true, Aradune isn&#39;t just any old<br/>
&gt; &gt;&#39;power-gamer&#39;...hehe...<br/>
