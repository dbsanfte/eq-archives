&gt; The hting all of you guys have to remember is your on a mature server and<br/>
&gt; you started a lot later then most people. I see level 10&#39;s not twinked<br/>
&gt; walking around in bronze armor. I remember when it was rare to see a level<br/>
&gt; 20 in bronze. You guys don&#39;t have anything to upgrade is becausey ou have<br/>
&gt; good stuff a bit earlier then you were ment to. There is nothing you can do<br/>
&gt; about that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope, there isn&#39;t. Starting on a new server can help a bit, but even on<br/>
the newer servers things become available way faster than when the game<br/>
started in March. I started a new char on The Tribunal and someone was<br/>
selling banded 4 days after the server opened!!! And there&#39;s a lot of<br/>
people who know all the tricks for levelling quickly now, so bronze and<br/>
20-30 level weapons hit the market way sooner.<br/>
