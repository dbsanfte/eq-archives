<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665388244">&lt;This isn&#39;t a case of RPers whining, this is a case of you cheating, whether<br/>
you<br/>
knew it or not, or acknowledge it or not.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, but when they do catch someone exploiting a bug and ban them,<br/>
they make sure to announce the names of the guilty parties.<br/>
There, Mr.. Say-Ten had been filled in on the possible consequences of his<br/>
actions even though it&#39;s really none of anyone e;se&#39;s business how he<br/>
chooses to play, as long as no one else is being hurt by it.  If it does<br/>
hurt you in some way (takes money from your bank acct, drains exp. from your<br/>
character, causes your PC to crash, etc.) please let me know.  I, for one,<br/>
would be fascinated to know how and/or why the way he, I, or anyone else<br/>
plays (aside from direct interaction between characters) could possibly be<br/>
of any consequence to you or anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Anyone who doesn&#39;t have a problem with what you did could only be a cheater<br/>
themselves, as far as I could imagine.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem with it, and am a bit of an RP&#39;r myself, and have<br/>
NEVER used a cheat or exploited a bug (that I know of) in this game.  As<br/>
long as he&#39;s not stealing my kills from me (which would be damned hard to do<br/>
considering we&#39;re on different  servers) or my friends why SHOULD I have a<br/>
problem with the way he plays?<br/>
<br/>
This whole line of thought smacks a little too much of &quot;Big Brother&quot; to me.<br/>
