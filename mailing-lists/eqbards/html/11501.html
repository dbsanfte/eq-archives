&gt; Okay, comparing it to the other songs, this is what I think.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Healing:1&quot; is equivalent to the Hymn, so it&#39;s a replacement for our <br/>
&gt; all-purpose Hymn (Notice that the Hymn goes up as you go up in level..)<br/>
&gt; &quot;Strength:10&quot; is double what the Anthem de Arms provides.  Anyone know if <br/>
&gt; that one goes up as you age?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it does.  Was +26 or +27 last time I checked it (L38-40,<br/>
don&#39;t remember).<br/>

&gt; in fact, absorb about half of the HP that your HP buff gives you.<br/>
&gt; Until we get a test, however, this is all up for grabs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Notice that Hymn is listed as 1, but obviously does more than<br/>
1 point per tick.  I would guess that Skin: 10 would be<br/>
similar - either not related to hp, or modified by bard level.<br/>
