<br/>
I would be really glad if anyone could explain me the use of the sneak<br/>
skill. I haven&#39;t seen one person in the game who could explain me how it works<br/>
and what it really does. It is said that monsters can&#39;t hear you when your<br/>
sneaking, but I really doubt that this is very usefull. I don&#39;t know either<br/>
how to use it correctly. Do you have to be in walk mode to start sneaking?<br/>
Sometimes I just can&#39;t hit the sneak button for hours, i don&#39;t know why.<br/>
I would really appreciate every kind of help...<br/>
