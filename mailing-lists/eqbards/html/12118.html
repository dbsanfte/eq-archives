and max faction, and certain actions not only change your<br/>
faction, but change the cap as well.  So for example, if<br/>
killing enough live frogs in Guk lowers your max faction cap,<br/>
you could reach a point where killing an infinite number of<br/>
dead frogs will not get you back to dubious (not-KOS) with the<br/>
live frogs.<br/>
