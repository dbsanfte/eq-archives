<div id="ygrps-yiv-853077765">My Bard, has never ever been given a single item or money!  Not that I do<br/>
not have friends who offer.  But I always turn it down.  If you twink a<br/>
character, you are giving them something, but you are also taking something<br/>
even more valuable away from them.  The wonderfull experience of leveling on<br/>
their own.  And knowing that thay can look at their inventory and remember<br/>
all of the wonderfull adventures spent on getting the wonderfull items.<br/>
Especially for a bard, you need to build up stories, and adventures.  If you<br/>
really want to know what its all about, give your bogus items back.<br/>
Experience the thrill of the first Tarnished weapon.  If you skip past that,<br/>
you will be missing alot.  I have some bronze, some banded, a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
(what a glorius day, when my party killed Dvinn) and a Puguis (Another<br/>
glorious day when we killed a lesser blade fiend in unrest).  This is great<br/>
for my level.  I have been saving for the last 2 weeks to get a bronze<br/>
breastplate, I know have 97 plat. whoo hoo. <br/>
<br/>
I must admit I get pizzed when I see a /con green player wearing full<br/>
Bronze, spouting out about how he knows how to buy/sell and make money, only<br/>
to admit that they were given all they have by their guild.  I have heard<br/>
that sooo many times from twinkies.  Its not buy low sell high... its get<br/>
free sell high, and it bugs me.  After all its not being there, its getting<br/>
there.  In my humble opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the vent.<br/>

I have played several characters till early teens, I must say my new bard<br/>
(10th) is the best of the lot. I trully enjoy the reward every level, I also<br/>
like the fact not all songs are avail at every Bard Hall. I have opinions on<br/>
Twinking but they are simply my opinion and even though I feel justified in<br/>
my beliefs I understand other people also have their own beliefs. I can<br/>
easily see how wars based on relegion happen, but as long as we all respect<br/>
everyones right to an opinion then things will be fine.<br/>
I was given 20Plat as a new player by a person simply walking by, I had<br/>
never met him before and was reciently given a Thulian Claw by an old friend<br/>
(Yes this is twinking) but I do not feel like I have cheated in any way, I<br/>
did not ask for the claw and I have copped plenty for using it. Usually like<br/>
I am 16th level and you con green to me yet you have a high level weapon you<br/>
cheating twink, I feel this not fair as all I have is this claw and a set of<br/>
PW armour and a drum.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway my 2c on twinking.<br/>
