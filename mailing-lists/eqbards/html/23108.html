<div id="ygrps-yiv-956785757">Yah, two DT&#39;s would be bad, 3 would be death since I&#39;m a scrawny wood elf<br/>
bard and only have 840 hp&#39;s with equip.  Maybe I can bum a talisman off<br/>

They probable DT for about 300 points max. I did take 2 DT&#39;s as a 35 bard <br/>
and since we have such wimpy hit points, couldn&#39;t have been more than that.<br/>
<br/>
I do highly recommend you get a SoW to pull one out of the canyon, even <br/>
before our drums were broken.<br/>
