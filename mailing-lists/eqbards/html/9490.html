<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307352177">No it&#39;s true to commemorate PoH they spawned monsters that come from PoH.<br/>
The surge of undead were monsters found from PoH. They just happened to do<br/>
it then. Also if you were on at the time you would of noticed the messages<br/>
GM&#39;s were putting out on the servers.<br/>

&gt;&gt; PoH was opened this weekend.  That was the reason for all the<br/>
&gt;&gt; undead all over the place and the GM events on all the servers<br/>
&gt;&gt; - PoH was opened and released hell spawn onto Norrath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Where did you hear this? The Plane of Hate hasn&#39;t been opened<br/>
&gt;yet. The surge in undead around the land was for Halloween. You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;see things returning to normal now that it&#39;s over.<br/>
