<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267704264">Generally speaking I just ignore folks who post anything about &#39;breaking&#39;<br/>
fear being the &#39;proper&#39; way to do things.  It&#39;s a zone, like any other.<br/>
It&#39;s designed so that getting IN is hard.  But it&#39;s not designed<br/>
specifically to force a re-break.  If it were the entire zone would respawn<br/>
at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Break or not break doesn&#39;t matter.  Folks like Sartori just like to pretend<br/>
that you didn&#39;t &quot;earn&quot; your time in fear unless you broke it.  It&#39;s an ego<br/>
thing nothing more nothing less.<br/>
<br/>
Me?  I&#39;ve done it both ways.  To be honest I could care less if a guild did<br/>
a fear &quot;Break&quot; or &quot;farmed&quot; repops.  Either way is fine by me.  Get your<br/>
gear.  It&#39;s pretty needed in the later stages of a game.  I would say that a<br/>
player with planes gear is about twice as effective in a group as one<br/>
without it.  The added AC/MANA/STR/whatever is a huge bonus.  (why else<br/>
would everyone want planes gear?)  And it even helps when you&#39;re trying for<br/>
Kunark armor because you have that extra AC/Mana to take on those tougher<br/>
harder dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
Criticizing people for how they choose to get their gear is stupid.  They<br/>
pay $10 just like the next person.  How they play is up to them just like<br/>
how you play is up to you.  Sure farming repops is BORING, that doesn&#39;t make<br/>
it WRONG.<br/>
<br/>
No offense.. Been there, done that both ways.  Neither is right or wrong,<br/>
just different.<br/>
<br/>
If ya wanna go, go, don&#39;t worry about a damn &quot;break&quot;.  99% of the time on<br/>
the big servers the plane is already broken unless there&#39;s been a server<br/>
reset anyway.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sartori - I just turned 48, and I&#39;m in a small guild.  But again - I just<br/>
&gt; turned 48 - never been on a Plane or Dragon raid.  I know nothing of Plane<br/>
&gt; Raids: Fear, Hate, Air, Breaks or Respawns except for whets been posted on<br/>
&gt; this list - and the Backstage Forum.  And let&#39;s face it - there hasn&#39;t<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; much discussion of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had no idea WHAT to expect.  I was there to learn.  I don&#39;t recall any<br/>
&gt; discussion here of how respawns work in Fear and what to expect. No one<br/>
&gt; promised me any treasure - no one called it farming.  I was simply asked<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; I wanted to &quot;join a raid on fear&quot;.  I posted my experience and asked a<br/>
&gt; question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would love to participate in Breaking Fear.  It occurred at 7:30 AM my<br/>
&gt; time while I was sound asleep (I am a professional musician and was<br/>
working<br/>
&gt; until 12:30 the night before - had dinner with the guys in the band - got<br/>
&gt; home at 3:30).  As soon as someone invites me to break fear - I&#39;m in.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not like I can organize one myself having participated once in a respawn<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; never been on a break...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I posted what I posted to find out if this was typical; to find out what<br/>
&gt; items do in fact drop there and to ask how the respawn works.  I posted<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; for all the other Bards who&#39;ve never been invited on a Fear Raid to know<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; experience AND HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT! (I sure didn&#39;t).  No one<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; they were farming treasure - no one promised me anything.  The only thing<br/>
&gt; was a general belief that things start to respawn in numbers after a good<br/>
&gt; 12-14 hours.  They organized 4 full groups expecting to need them all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I appreciate the information you posted, but I found your post to be<br/>
&gt; patronizing, sarcastic and even insulting.  It seems to me that over the<br/>
&gt; time, this board has been declining in tone.  I worry that we are getting<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the point where people are going to be afraid to post something without<br/>
&gt; being jumped on.  It&#39;s not surprising the number of people who have<br/>
quietly<br/>
&gt; disappeared from here and stopped posting.  It shouldn&#39;t be a crime to be<br/>
&gt; wrong; and even worse - to have an opinion - and my God - asking a<br/>
question?<br/>

&gt; How does one go to an already broken Fear plane and not expect to be bored<br/>
&gt; off his ass? The only time I could see this being even remotely exciting<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; if a GM showed up and re-popped the entire zone at once, which they would<br/>
&gt; only do if some mobs were bugged.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As the other guys said, all imbrued armor is dropped in the Plane of Hate,<br/>
&gt; unless you get lucky and see it drop on a cube in Fear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you want an exciting experience, try not farming Fear for once, and<br/>
&gt; instead breaking it open on a full pop. You might actually have a<br/>
challenge<br/>
&gt; *gasp* and fun. Instead of seeing maybe 2-3 dozen mobs in 5.5 hours, you<br/>
&gt; will more than likely see 2-3 dozen mobs in your first couple hours,<br/>
&gt; depending on how efficient your raiding party is. Not only will you kill a<br/>
&gt; lot more in less time, but you will see more loot drop in a shorter amount<br/>
&gt; of time. Last time I was on a Fear raid, we saw no less than 8 drops in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; first hour. It reminded me of the candyland that was the original Fear<br/>
plane<br/>
&gt; opening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, I&#39;d have to say that breaking Fear on a full pop is one of the<br/>
&gt; most fun experiences I have ever had in EQ, next to maybe killing Trak.<br/>
&gt; Kiting dracolich around is pretty fun too. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People farming Fear and then wondering where the fun went baffle me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This reminds me of a running joke some friends have about farming Fear (if<br/>
&gt; this offends any of you, oh well):<br/>
&gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;Hail there hardy adventurer, would you be interested in<br/>
&gt; [Farming The Plane of Fear]?&#39;<br/>
&gt; Kruegen says, &#39;How do I farm the plane of fear?<br/>
&gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;It is an easy task, done by many! Simply fetch me [a<br/>
shovel]<br/>
&gt; and [Treasure bag] and we can get started! There is a [reward]!<br/>
&gt; Kruegen says, &#39;What is the reward?&#39;<br/>
&gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;Ah! The reward you ask? The reward is free [phat lewtz]<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; no risk other then [/random 100].<br/>
