invisibility on you get canceled by the next pulse of the song?<br/>
(The Invisibility is canceled, the icon stays up. Windsong&#39;s been<br/>
killed by someone with invisibility walking through her song radius,<br/>
then out again, blissfully thinking he was invis, and he wasn&#39;t. The<br/>
resulting<br/>
train killed both him and her)<br/>
<br/>
(And no, you can&#39;t have both Invisibility and Invisibility to Undead<br/>
cast on you by someone else. The spells overwrite each other. Only one<br/>
is allowed)</div>
