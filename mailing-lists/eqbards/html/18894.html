<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224567739"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You can get invis to undead potions to supplement your invis or go with<br/>
&gt;someone who can cast it.  Or go with someone who can revive you<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um. 1) If you are singing a song, doesn&#39;t casting any sort of<br/>
invisibility on you get canceled by the next pulse of the song?<br/>
(The Invisibility is canceled, the icon stays up. Windsong&#39;s been<br/>
killed by someone with invisibility walking through her song radius,<br/>
then out again, blissfully thinking he was invis, and he wasn&#39;t. The<br/>
resulting<br/>
train killed both him and her)<br/>
<br/>
(And no, you can&#39;t have both Invisibility and Invisibility to Undead<br/>
cast on you by someone else. The spells overwrite each other. Only one<br/>
is allowed)</div>
