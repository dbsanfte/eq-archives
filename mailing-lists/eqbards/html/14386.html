<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-350409791">Golias, the official LoreKeeper of Trivial Items, would like to mention...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the gripe about Verant releasing only 3 continents out of 5, and how<br/>
that somehow relates to them being lazy/not delivering on their promises.<br/>
<br/>
For those that didn&#39;t slavishly follow the game before beta and release, nor<br/>
read the chat logs with Brad and group, here&#39;s the scoop.<br/>
<br/>
The original spec said 5 continents with 40 zones.  They shipped with 3<br/>
continents and over 70 zones.<br/>
<br/>
Just, FYI.<br/>
