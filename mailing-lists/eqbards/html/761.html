<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449254323"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Actually there&#39;s a very easy way to &quot;fix&quot; this. After any weapon&#39;s special<br/>
&gt;effect goes off bard songs get hosed. To fix it just hit any song 2 or more<br/>
&gt;times until you get the &quot;You have not recovered yet&quot; message and that will<br/>
&gt;fix it. The stuck icon on the screen will wear off and you can then cast<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried this and it didn&#39;t help one bit.  What exactly are you doing?  Are you using hotkeys or the mouse?  I didn&#39;t try it with the mouse.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the level 27 song ROCKS!  There&#39;s nothing so satisfying as seeing one enemy backstab another for 124 points of damage...<br/>
