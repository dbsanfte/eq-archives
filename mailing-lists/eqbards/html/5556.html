<div id="ygrps-yiv-61087855">(Written immediately before reading Mr. Kim&#39;s post outlining the very<br/>
experience I had had, causing me to once again ask myself, Does this man<br/>
have all the answers? ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to explore much of Befallen, but like many of us I have a hard<br/>
time turning down requests to help find corpses (seeing the hardships many<br/>
newbies go through in East Commons and it being so easy to lend a hand..).<br/>
A dwarven cleric had died to the necro at the bottom of the stone spiral<br/>
staircase (just past the first lock), and I offered to play bloodhound.<br/>
<br/>
After taking a few bearings, I found myself pointed straight into the wall<br/>
toward the entrance of the dungeon.  This being early in my spelunking<br/>
career, I jogged off around the corner, thinking it could be in the next<br/>
room over.  I opened the door to lots of big nasty thing running straight<br/>
at me, and promptly hightailed it to the zone (one lesson I had learned<br/>
sooner).<br/>
<br/>
I returned to the landing and continued pointing at this wall.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
figure it out, how could the corpse be that way when there&#39;s nothing<br/>
directly over that way?  Then Quellious whispered in my ear, and I<br/>
recalled seeing a dwarven corpse half in the wall up next to the zone.  I<br/>
told him to follow me, and he did (rather hesitatingly) back to the zone.<br/>
I selected the corpse, and sure enough it belonged to him.  Mystery one<br/>
solved, enter mysteries two and three.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;What do you mean, my corpse isn&#39;t here.&#39;  Yes it is, I respond, I&#39;m<br/>
selecting it right now.  Try typing /corpse.  Nothing.  Try looting it.<br/>
Nothing.  I&#39;d been working on him with this for at least half an hour, and<br/>
felt I&#39;d proven myself honest enough to offer a /consent Athren.  He<br/>
considers for a few minutes, then decides to take the chance, and I<br/>
restore his much-missed bronze exoskeleton to him.<br/>
<br/>
[Before someone mentions targeting and /corpse&#39;ing it further out, I<br/>
didn&#39;t know about that at the time.]<br/>
<br/>
The third came about in a more mysterious fashion (as is the way of all<br/>
good enigmas).  I noticed another corpse nearby, also half stuck in the<br/>
wall, and had seen the person who belonged to it nakedly camping the<br/>
locked door.  She had died in a similar location as the above dwarf, and<br/>
her corpse &#39;washed up&#39; (the term I coined for this phenomenon) in nearly<br/>
the same place.<br/>
<br/>
One more piece of evidence to submit before drawing conclusions.  During a<br/>
fishing spell in South Qeynos, I picked up a request for help in locating<br/>
a corpse on the Feline Island in Erud&#39;s Crossing.  With little else to do<br/>
for entertainment, I gladly sent in my resume, as this not only gave me a<br/>
chance to help someone in a pinch, but also served as a much sought after<br/>
excuse to head further west into uncharted (speaking personally)<br/>
territory.  The two of us hopped the next boat (gosh this boat seems much<br/>
faster than Stormbreaker) to conduct our business.<br/>
<br/>
Gaining the shoreline, my compatriot warned me of the sharks infesting the<br/>
waters nearby (a far cry from the safety of the Ocean of Tears, where I<br/>
threw myself to the waters ON PURPOSE in the name of exploration and ended<br/>
up with an extremely boring three hour tour, but that&#39;s another story).<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s initial pulse told me the corpse was off the beach to the right of<br/>
the dock, and a few more pulses down the sand (three cheers for geometry)<br/>
had it at not too far off shore.  I exploited the &quot;almost underwater but<br/>
not quite&quot; bug which allows you to see under the surface the distance you<br/>
could above it clearly for a split second (shame on me, walk into water<br/>
slowly to see what I mean), and spotted the body directly beneath two<br/>
extremely disgruntled sharks.<br/>
<br/>
Now I had been a good little jack of all trades and was proficient enough<br/>
at swimming to offer, for the cost of a /consent Athren, to drag his<br/>
corpse above sea level for easy reaquisition.  He graciously declined,<br/>
turned invisible, and got it for himself.  As reward, he had offered plat<br/>
in his initial shout, but like any good samaritan I turned it down.<br/>
Surprise Athren, you just helped some guild&#39;s blacksmith, how would you<br/>
like a banded tunic and arms?<br/>
<br/>
The point of the story (beyond entertainment) is contained in a passing<br/>
statement he made as we continued on to the bank in Erudin.  He said he<br/>
had died while lagging out, and that this wasn&#39;t the first time.  In fact,<br/>
the time before it he had found his corpse in the very same spot.<br/>
<br/>
The insight I gleaned from these separate incidents: Zones have a &#39;washing<br/>
up&#39; point, a sort of shoreline for corpses that are somehow lost in places<br/>
that don&#39;t exist, by which I mean somewhere outside the current zone map<br/>
(swim under the bridge from North Karana to East Karana and you&#39;ll<br/>
experience what it&#39;s like to fall outside the world; an excrutiatingly<br/>
unpleasant feeling, to be sure).  Is this helpful in everyday happenings?<br/>
Not especially, but I enjoy discovering the proverbial laws of physics as<br/>
they apply to this world.<br/>
