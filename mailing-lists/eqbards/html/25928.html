<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774266245">Speaking of interacting and stuff, I starting doing my vp key quest, i&#39;m not<br/>
very far in it, I was camping pained soul (which turned out to be me after a<br/>
few hours, and I&#39;m still not done there). Anyways, I got a few mantrap root<br/>
or something while I was there (which have an icon of a flower).<br/>
<br/>
Time goes by, we go do Doze in tov, and our resident mage always hands me a<br/>
modrod as soon as I get there, but this time I gave her the flowers in<br/>
exchange, needless to say she was very surprised, but hey, it put a smile on<br/>
her face, which is all good. There was nothing about it, it was simply a<br/>
friendly gesture.  <br/>

Most of my alts are female (wanna make something of it?), and I have to<br/>
agree with Wendy.  Not only are<br/>
there a lot of players in this game who don&#39;t know how to relate to women,<br/>
there are some players in this<br/>
game I really think should be locked up for the safety of their female<br/>
townsfolk.<br/>
