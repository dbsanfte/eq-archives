<div id="ygrps-yiv-446141352">That shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  I live in Austin, the same place where<br/>
they&#39;re basing thier Star Wars game.  They have (or will soon) have the<br/>
facilities and will have 0 problem getting qualified QA to do it. <br/>
Hell, the QA house I work for will start outsourcing nationally within<br/>
in a few months.  With a WANesque program like EQ and a dedicated<br/>
remote test server it would be a snap.  Combine that with a bug<br/>
database and communications system (hell, Lotus would do it) on the<br/>
same setup and you have all the QA you need.  They could even bilk<br/>
people for $10 per hour and they would still do it.  Sure they&#39;d need<br/>
to do phone interviews and check background/references but it&#39;s far<br/>
from impossible.  I&#39;d do it after work if I were offered the<br/>
opportunity to be sure.  For something like this local resources are<br/>
much less of a problem than for other software types.  If they&#39;re<br/>
having trouble finding people to work for them on the west<br/>
coast...maybe they chose the wrong place to start the whole deal up. <br/>
When has Verant been one to think ahead?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, maybe it&#39;s not their QA team at all.  Nothing is stopping<br/>
them from closing bugs QA writes and even sending code to patch w/o<br/>
passing it through the QA filter first.<br/>

&gt; guess what, it&#39;s easy to say we need 10 testers, it&#39;s another thing<br/>
&gt; entirely to hire 10<br/>
&gt; qualified people to be testers.<br/>
