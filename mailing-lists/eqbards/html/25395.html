I think once you have a kid, that&#39;s the beginning of the end.  Either<br/>
quitting, or playing casual.  Plus the reason I played so much from<br/>
51-59 was because of RL problems, once the RL problems ended is when I<br/>
quit.  Now that they are not only gone but better, I am definitely<br/>
staying casual.<br/>

No problem at all Shaisi :P<br/>
Sometimes it makes me laugh at how worked up ALL of us get over a game.<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m a little jealous that you broke out of the never ending<br/>
guild raids etc.  I&#39;m getting a little fed up.. sure its fun doing &quot;new&quot;<br/>
things but is it really worth it to spend EVERY WAKING MOMENT online at<br/>
huge<br/>
raids listening to 15 year olds (and 30 year olds) argue about loot?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm sounding a little bitter aren&#39;t I?</div>
