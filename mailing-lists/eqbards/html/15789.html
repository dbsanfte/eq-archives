Hmm.  The only win2k drivers they have that are newer than the ones on the<br/>
Win2k CD are beta drivers.<br/>
<br/>
Of course.. it couldn&#39;t do any worse than the ones you&#39;re using, right? :)<br/>

<br/>
The win2k section is about halfway down the page.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note.. you should go to the websites for ALL the hardware<br/>
components you have.. video card, sound card, etc and see if they have new<br/>
drivers out.<br/>

&gt; p.s. it seems to have to do with being online.  I can run the tutorial<br/>
