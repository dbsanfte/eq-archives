&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I hate being right about something like this :(.  I really would<br/>
&gt; like to know why such a blatant bug on test would be propped <br/>
&gt; to the live<br/>
&gt; servers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Also, why is it that i can no longer outrun sow speeds <br/>
&gt; without the<br/>
&gt; drum? Prepatch I was still faster than SOW without an <br/>
&gt; instrument, now i am a<br/>
&gt; bit slower.<br/>
