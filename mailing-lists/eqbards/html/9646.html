&gt; used me as a distraction.  He only said &quot;They were resisting.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; wanna die again.&quot;  The other thing that I learned is that when I&#39;m in<br/>
&gt; pickup<br/>
&gt; groups I should always have some sort of personal protection song memmed<br/>
&gt; like Screech - a word from the just-a-bit-wiser.<br/>

that tip :(<br/>

&gt; Why don&#39;t people realize that it&#39;s THREE zones to Cazic from Arena and SIX<br/>
&gt; zones to Cazic from Freeport??  Is there swimming skill just so low that<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t want to swim Lake Rathe?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

	Nro-Oas-Sro-Innothule-Feerot-Cazic (I don&#39;t bind at bank)<br/>
<br/>
	4 zones to 6, And it used to take me longer to run through Rathe Mts<br/>
than through Nro-Oasis-Sro combined (of course now after stumbling around<br/>
that zone lost so many times, I&#39;ve become a bit faster).  But I still think<br/>
it&#39;s slightly faster to go through NRO-Oasis, than swimming the Lake<br/>
(swimming of 120+), which puts it roughly equal, and I get to avoid the<br/>
random clops in Mts.<br/>
