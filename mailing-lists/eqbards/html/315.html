<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234734389">An interesting thing Verant just casually tossed out here for the Guides to<br/>
follow.<br/>
<br/>
	Based on that vague sentence, all spell casters can be theoretically<br/>
considered exploiting the game whenever they cast a spell that does damage<br/>
to a creature and that damage can kill it... The name they gave to it,<br/>
&#39;Farming&#39;, doesn&#39;t help in what they intend it to mean either. Are we<br/>
planting these creatures to harvest them? Odd.	Does it also mean a spell<br/>
can&#39;t be used to lure a creature into an ambush? What other point of luring<br/>
a creature is there?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	I also have a disagreement that they consider price gouging an exploit.<br/>
WTH? Isn&#39;t EQ an economy? In times of high demand, price goes up. If there<br/>
is high supply, no one is forcing someone to buy an item at the high price.<br/>
Competition will always sell for less.<br/>
<br/>
	But then again I am only a lowly opinion.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

Kiting is an &quot;exploit,&quot; apparently, officially.<br/>
<br/>
Read the new Guide section on the offical website.<br/>

Check this quote about exploits:<br/>
Farming - using broken spells or specific spell effects to kill, drag, or<br/>
lure monsters, thus gaining experience/loot from them.<br/>
<br/>
Boom.  Right there, they are looking for that kind of business.  Don&#39;t do<br/>
it.<br/>
