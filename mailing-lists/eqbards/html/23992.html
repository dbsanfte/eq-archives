&gt; &gt;well.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;When you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>
&gt; &gt;playing the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>
&gt; &gt;different comparisons, really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s definitely an elitist point of view.  You might as well say that a<br/>
&gt;good bard player is inherently a better player than a good druid player can<br/>
&gt;ever be because a bard is so much harder to play.  By your definition a gun<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t more powerful than a sword, because a sword is harder to use<br/>
&gt;effectively.  If it is easier to accomplish the same thing with two<br/>
&gt;different tools, but is easier with tool A than with tool B, then tool A is<br/>
&gt;by definition more powerful than Tool B.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>nope, i&#39;m saying a good bard player will have a bigger impact on his group than<br/>
a good druid player.  i agree that the good bard player will have to work harder to<br/>
make that impact, but the impact is still there.<br/>
<br/>
the gun analogy doesn&#39;t work for me, cuz a gun is obviously more powerful than<br/>
a sword, and it is easier to use.  we&#39;re talking about something more powerful but<br/>
harder to use.<br/>

&gt;No, they&#39;re saying &quot;that&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and I&#39;m saying, &quot;Yeah, too bad each<br/>
&gt;plant only produces 1.&quot;  For an equal amount of effort, not skill<br/>
&gt;necessarily, bards get far less return than other classes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but, assuming &#39;&#39;size is everything&#39;&#39; (haha) regardless if the plant produces one or 20,<br/>
that grape is still a big grape.  you&#39;re not comparing plants, you&#39;re comparing grapes.<br/>
