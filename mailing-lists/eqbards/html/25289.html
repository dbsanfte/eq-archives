<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690457498">Have you all heard the story of the ranger that got the solo kill on<br/>
Talendor?  :)<br/>
<br/>
Heh...it was the darndest thing.  Was a near wipeout when he went into run<br/>
mode, and all that was left to beat on him was the ranger, Dreadmere.<br/>
<br/>
I obviously didn&#39;t participate, although I did get too close and died<br/>
anyway...heh.<br/>
