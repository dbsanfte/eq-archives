<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591980485">Actually there&#39;s a very easy way to &quot;fix&quot; this. After any weapon&#39;s special<br/>
effect goes off bard songs get hosed. To fix it just hit any song 2 or more<br/>
times until you get the &quot;You have not recovered yet&quot; message and that will<br/>
fix it. The stuck icon on the screen will wear off and you can then cast<br/>
songs normally. It&#39;s annoying, but easy enough to get around that I would<br/>
never give up a weapon just because it did this.<br/>

I remember reading this somewhere.  Any weapon that cast a spell when you<br/>
hit will also mess up your bard songs.  So stuff like the Granite Tomahawk<br/>
and the screaming mace are absolute no nos to bards.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I can confirm this one. Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side<br/>
Effects&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;at<br/>
&gt; &gt;times.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Some of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>
&gt; &gt;Root - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that<br/>
generate<br/>
&gt; &gt;the &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>
&gt; &gt;             have no effect on you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I seem to remember that WHILE playing Accelerando it was possible for me<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be rooted, BUT i could cancel the effect by stopping and restarting the<br/>
&gt; song. I don&#39;t recall it ever making you immune to root. Correct if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; wrong! =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another thing I found (to my dismay):  I was really excited when I got my<br/>
&gt; Screaming Mace. I know a bard using blunt weapons may sound strange, but<br/>
if &gt; you look at the stats the Screamer is like a magical mino axe - same<br/>
dmg, &gt; same speed, hits magical, and BONUS random Strength from it&#39;s<br/>
Scream/Yaulp &gt; (I really liked this because you could stack it on top of<br/>
EVERY other Str &gt; buff - I had like STR 175 or something with a shaman<br/>
buffing me, my strength &gt; songs, some magic items, and the Scream).<br/>
&gt; Well - it all sounds good, but I found that the Screamer causes your<br/>
songs &gt; to go out of wack. When the Scream is in effect you can&#39;t sing. You<br/>
start a &gt; song and it immediately ends with no effect. So I had to get rid<br/>
of my mace &gt; (sigh).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll post if I find that any other items cause this effect. Also would<br/>
&gt; appreciate if any other bards have experienced anything like this with<br/>
other &gt; magical items - it would be nice to post. It was rather irritating<br/>
to find &gt; this out after getting all the required components for the mace<br/>
(what a damn &gt; annoying quest).<br/>
