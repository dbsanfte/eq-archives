<div id="ygrps-yiv-471172672">I tested this a couple weeks ago - when it was mentioned.  I played Clouding<br/>
and waltzed in front of a low level skellie.  Skellie sees me (level 20 ish)<br/>
and goes agro - even though a soft mist surrounded me.<br/>
<br/>
The evil eyes and shaman&#39;s in Runnyeye also seem to be able to see invis.<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope it kicks in at level 23 - my next level :-)<br/>

		&gt; Verant NEVER tells us when they nerf our abilities...I<br/>
lost the invis vs<br/>

until I nearly died<br/>
		&gt; finding out by mistake:<br/>
<br/>
		I visited Unrest last week and had no problems using<br/>
Clouding<br/>
		to sneak past undead.  I explored a good portion of the<br/>
		basement using it, then I spent a good 3-4 hours pulling<br/>
from<br/>
		the basement using the song to scout ahead before pulling.<br/>
The<br/>
		song most definitely still works against undead - I would<br/>
con<br/>
		them and they&#39;d be in different to me.<br/>
<br/>
		Like I said, sometimes the hags cast see invisible on<br/>
		themselves and other mobs.  Or if you end up with a buggy<br/>
mob<br/>
		aggressive to you (which shouldn&#39;t happen anymore with the<br/>
		teleporting mob fix they put in), it and anything it alerts<br/>
		will remain aggressive to you even if you&#39;re invisible.<br/>
		Another possibility is that they changed the song so that<br/>
the<br/>
		invisibility to undead effect does not kick in until you<br/>
reach<br/>
		a higher level.  I&#39;ll have to as a bard friend that just got<br/>
		the song to test it for me.<br/>
