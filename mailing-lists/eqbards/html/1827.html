<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677326916">I would like any of these suggestions.  I&#39;m not much good at the short<br/>
sonnet or light verse.  O, I&#39;ve written some in my day, but find my muse<br/>
more with plot, an epic: such as Homer or, er, Star Wars.  As Homer did it,<br/>
one of his performances would only be a part of his larger epic.  That<br/>
chapter could really be enjoyed on its own, so I&#39;m not saying I have a<br/>
Stephen King novel, but rather a lyrical story set in parts.  Ah, well it<br/>
ain&#39;t exactly Star Wars either; O, there is a short little frazzled fellow<br/>
in it with big ears and huge eyes always lecturing about the forces of his<br/>
magic and all, but he&#39;s a gnome.<br/>
<br/>
Have worked out my epic mostly, and have a unique form to it.  Yet I do not<br/>
relish the idea of performing any of it, other than playing the type of<br/>
instrument in the section I need, managing emotes and some physical<br/>
activities on my part to add to the action of the story, etc.  It&#39;s just too<br/>
much if I have to be constantly typing as well.  So I&#39;ll probably never<br/>
perform it.  My epic, I can&#39;t be standing still in one place typing and<br/>
singing and gazing to the heavens, like Whitney Houston and a howling<br/>
ballad... I&#39;d need to rely on many other things to keep the audience<br/>
enthralled with the story, more akin to Mick Jagger running back and forth<br/>
and jumping around like a loon.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose a macro program will not work with EQ, then.  I&#39;ve been searching,<br/>
yet no luck finding an external utility to help me with any of this.  You<br/>
know, even considered joining the Soerbaird once, until I realized, alas,<br/>
the song in me just can&#39;t be sung.<br/>
