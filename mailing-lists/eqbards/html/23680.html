<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804340389">A week? How about a day hehe.  Last night the group I has in at D1 first<br/>
said &quot;I wish we had a shamen or chanter for speed&quot; To which I replied they<br/>
were getting speed fro, my songs.  Later in the night the monk commented<br/>
that he wished we had a shamen for slowing to which I replied I am slowing.<br/>
His reply was, oh I did not know bards could do that.  /sigh<br/>

&gt; True it happens on occasion - I can count, um three or four <br/>
&gt; times since<br/>
&gt; March of &#39;99 when I started playing this game...  But for <br/>
&gt; Bards - happens at<br/>
&gt; least three or four times A WEEK!<br/>

&gt; uhmmm, well, last time i was in seb, grouped with a warrior <br/>
&gt; who for some odd<br/>
&gt; reason kept telling our wizzie to summon a pet.  the wiz was <br/>
&gt; wearing a red<br/>
&gt; robe, /shrug.  then he started to tell me (i was playing my <br/>
&gt; enchanter):<br/>
&gt; &quot;mana suck this frog!&quot; and not just one time. he would point <br/>
&gt; to a frog and<br/>
&gt; tell me to mana tap it. then tell the wiz to summon a pet. at <br/>
&gt; first we kinda<br/>
&gt; made jokes: &quot;dude, i never bought that spell!&quot;  But he didn;t <br/>
&gt; seem to get it<br/>
&gt; and kept telling us what to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally i told him, &quot;dude, just exactly how long is the <br/>
&gt; recycle time on<br/>
&gt; theft of thought? when the spell is recycled - and when i <br/>
&gt; need mana - trust<br/>
&gt; me - i will tap them.  and btw, our wizzie cant summon pets <br/>
&gt; worth a darn.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so, i dunno if our study is totally scientific, but its not <br/>
&gt; just bards,<br/>
