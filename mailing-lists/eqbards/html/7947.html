<div id="ygrps-yiv-728180584">This isn&#39;t EVEN twinking.  You were reimbursed for a service that you<br/>
performed.  You earned that equipment, you just didn&#39;t fight for it yourself.<br/>
You should not feel bad about wearing it, and telling the story of how you got<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; I will probably regret sending this mail .. Please remember this is my first<br/>
mail list and I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months now, so many of<br/>
these comcepts are still new to me (Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I<br/>
have read the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a very high level<br/>
player, I did not understand the EXP share problem. He just asked me to keep<br/>
singing my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with him for<br/>
several hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this he<br/>
said he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him I needed<br/>
exp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for me and<br/>
initiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and he said<br/>
yes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a pair<br/>
of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I could see via<br/>
AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too good for my<br/>
level. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if I should wear<br/>
them/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with twinking but dont<br/>
want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an opinion on what I<br/>
should!<br/>
&gt;  do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards<br/>
