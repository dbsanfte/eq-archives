assignment of levels and abilities versus effectiveness appears seriously<br/>
inconsistent.<br/>

Last night some friends and I decided it was time for us to kill Dorn.<br/>
Revenge would be sweet.  We killed him twice and each time one of us died.<br/>
<br/>
We were me, 15th level human bard, a 16th level human cleric, and a 17th<br/>
level dwarf warrior.  We are all reasonabley well equipped and reasonably<br/>
effective fighting as a group.  Dorn appeared equal to me, the lowest in<br/>
the group.  His abilities said by far otherwise, even though he cast no<br/>
magic, had no weapon, and provided no loot.<br/>
<br/>
We went to Oasis where the three of us could consistently take orc warriors<br/>
that /consed red to our dwarf.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously /con can not be taken as anywhere near an accurate reflection of<br/>
danger.<br/>
