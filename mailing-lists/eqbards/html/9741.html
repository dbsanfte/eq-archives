<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So to sum it all up, I think it is more likely that our <br/>
&gt; missing songs will<br/>
&gt; be better versions/combos of our current songs versus songs <br/>
&gt; that give us a<br/>
&gt; new ability such as bind or gate.  What does everyone else think?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a reasonably safe assumption.  However, I think that there are a few<br/>
stones left unturned (as far as new song abilities/effects go), so there<br/>
might be a chance that we see something totally new - which would be great<br/>
IMO.  Personally, I have this feeling that they&#39;re going to reorganize the<br/>
entire top-end of the song listing (30+).  It doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense<br/>
the way it&#39;s configured now (IMO).  It&#39;s kinda sad... after I hit 32 (which<br/>
should be later this week), I don&#39;t have any songs to _really_ look forward<br/>
to, other than the 48 and 50 songs.  I know there are some good ones along<br/>
the way, but nothing compared to the &quot;game winners&quot; that we get below 32.<br/>
