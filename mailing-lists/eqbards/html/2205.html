<div id="ygrps-yiv-108936225">I learned this the hard was.<br/>
<br/>
I tested invis in the gorge.  OK the minor still saw me.  Lesson one<br/>
learned<br/>
<br/>
Grouped with a neco in Najena.  Fell in the trap and our group survived<br/>
the baddies.<br/>
<br/>
Only to have the injured halfling attack the necros pet.  the necro<br/>
Feigned and I started invis.  We are fine, right?  nope the invis<br/>
lapsed on the necro and the halfling attacks him.  he feigns again. <br/>
now the halfling is attacking me...  <br/>
<br/>
Had to bolt for the exit as I don&#39;t want bad halfling faction. <br/>
Everyone was following but, in the mess one of the other party members<br/>
gets stunned and left to die to the nasties of najena.  We were<br/>
basically lost and looking for a way out.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
those terrors kill quickly when you are alone.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Question about the invis song:  Is it possible to<br/>
&gt; hit something then run far<br/>
&gt; &gt; away but not zone and hit Invis, will the mob that<br/>
&gt; u were hitting find u?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nope.  A mob that&#39;s aggressive to you will see you<br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; invisibility (although if you run far enough away<br/>
&gt; from many<br/>
&gt; mobs, they will give up chasing you although their<br/>
&gt; aggressive<br/>
&gt; radius to you remains enlarged).  In fact, if you<br/>
&gt; are playing<br/>
&gt; the invisibility song and any member of your party<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; attacked, you will immediately be attacked because<br/>
&gt; (1) you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; a bard, and (2) you cast a beneficial &quot;spell&quot; on<br/>
&gt; someone who<br/>
&gt; was just attacked so the mob is now aggressive to<br/>
&gt; you too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because of (1) it&#39;s actually not uncommon for one of<br/>
&gt; my party<br/>
&gt; to briefly become visible, the mob(s) charge him,<br/>
&gt; and the next<br/>
&gt; pulse they all retarget me because I&#39;m a bard.  What<br/>
&gt; can I<br/>
&gt; say, get good armor.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You really have to watch out for (2) if you&#39;re in a<br/>
&gt; group with<br/>
&gt; mixed factions.  If your paladin friend has to kill<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; corrupt guard at the Freeport bank and your song<br/>
&gt; pulses on him<br/>
&gt; while he fights, you will lose faction along with<br/>
&gt; him.  If<br/>
&gt; your troll buddy gets whacked by the guards and one<br/>
&gt; of your<br/>
&gt; songs pulses before he dies, the guards will be<br/>
&gt; after you<br/>
&gt; next.<br/>
