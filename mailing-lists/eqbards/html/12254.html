<div id="ygrps-yiv-688330726">My level 35 rogue (as of last night...yaay!) has two SBDs (serrated bone<br/>
dirks), and a dex of 153 unbuffed...but frankly, it seems to me like the<br/>
random number generator has more control over when weapons proc than dex<br/>
does.  I say this, because most of the time I&#39;m fighting, my weapons proc in<br/>
clumps, like....sometimes 2 procs in the same round, then another proc in<br/>
the round after that, then maybe nothing for 3 more fights.  Also, when<br/>
buffed I have 183 dex (hehe), and really don&#39;t notice the difference between<br/>
183 and 153.  *shrug*<br/>

&gt; My experience wih procing is based on my Staff of Wiggling and Obscene<br/>
&gt; Shard.  My guess is that dex much under 100 is considered sub standard -<br/>
&gt; over & close 100 about &#39;normal&#39; - near or over 120 &#39;above average&#39; and<br/>
above<br/>
&gt; that probably only marginally better.  I think that there are &quot;break<br/>
points&quot;<br/>
&gt; where if you get past them you see better results but that the result<br/>
curve<br/>
&gt; is not strictly linear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These are approximate numbers to illustrate the non-linear nature and<br/>
point<br/>
&gt; of diminishing returns.  I have no scientific data to back this up. But he<br/>
&gt; point is - some good base dex to get you at or close to 100 combind with<br/>
&gt; some typical dex items to get you over 110 and maybe near to 120 should do<br/>
&gt; pretty well. If songs then take the party over 130ish and give them other<br/>
&gt; stats as well, you are doing prolly the best you can.  To overload on dex<br/>
&gt; items and buff over 140/150/160 prolly has marginal result and your<br/>
&gt; slots/pp/buffs might be better spent on other stuff.<br/>

&gt; Unless I&#39;m mistaken, Ykesha won&#39;t proc at all until level 38, so maybe<br/>
proc<br/>
&gt; frequency has to do with level as well as dex. Dunno. Ain&#39;t gone one. Sure<br/>
&gt; ain&#39;t level 38 :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If and when the Ykesha procs and is dependent upon your DEX. What<br/>
&gt; &gt; does your DEX need to be for it to proc well?  Mine is 135 right now.<br/>
