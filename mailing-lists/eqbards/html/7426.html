<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143371968">i know this was said, but it can&#39;t be said enough.  there are pure casters<br/>
and priests, then hybrids.  you mentioned two of the priest classes, druids<br/>
being the third.  in order to be a hybrid, you must be a combination of 2<br/>
classes (thus the term hybrid).  only SHD, PAL, RNG can be classified in<br/>
this way.  you can not name 2 classes that make up cleric, shaman, druid.<br/>
bard is a toss-up, but if it comes down to it can be classified a hybrid<br/>
just by default not being in another category.<br/>

&gt; think of it, so<br/>
&gt; are Clerics...<br/>
