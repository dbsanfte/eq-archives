<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476909516">My Steel plate is a kinda pinky colour, no blue whatsoever (except my new<br/>
Lambent Sleeves  8-)    that I got last night).<br/>
My next task is to get the Lambent Boots (all I need now is Firewalker<br/>
boots). Then I shall get my greaves, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll get the helm<br/>
though.<br/>

An appearance question for all you steel plate wearing wood-elf males out<br/>
there.  What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am wearing the shin<br/>
greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I have never seen<br/>
anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be a rose tinged<br/>
silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>
examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The wood elf<br/>
females<br/>
I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged.  Is this the<br/>
normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose color is<br/>
normal<br/>
then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>
