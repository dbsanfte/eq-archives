&gt; I have heard of a zombie skin quest from a member of my guild <br/>
&gt; that raises<br/>
&gt; faction with them.   I do not know where it starts or the details, try<br/>
&gt; looking it up on the web.  You can also kill the heritics <br/>
&gt; somewhere in Tox.<br/>
&gt;  It is a nice looking plate, too bad the dwarven ringmail <br/>
&gt; tunic has better<br/>
&gt; stats =(<br/>

&gt; &gt;I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.  I was hoping to do this <br/>
&gt; quest but can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;get my faction high enough with the Deepwater Knights in <br/>
&gt; Erudin to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Guild master to give me the quest or any other quest for <br/>
&gt; that matter.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;used the Charismatic Carillon to get me up to indifferent <br/>
&gt; but that is as<br/>
&gt; &gt;High as I can go.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I also looked to see if there were any other ways to raise <br/>
&gt; my faction but<br/>
&gt; &gt;could only find the Odus Pearl quest which raises faction <br/>
&gt; with the Knights.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, it is given by the same guy in the guild and needs a<br/>
&gt; &gt;container he gives you to complete it.  Again, he won&#39;t talk <br/>
&gt; to me about any<br/>
&gt; &gt;quests.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Kitasi, you are the king of quests from what I hear, maybe <br/>
&gt; you know what I<br/>
&gt; &gt;can do.  Or if, in fact it is a lost cause.  Anyone who has <br/>
&gt; any info can<br/>
&gt; &gt;share, not just Kit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried this a while back and ran into the same problem you did. I ran all<br/>
around Tox forest killing creatures to see if I could raise my faction, but<br/>
there were none and those dang kobolds kept &#39;porting away from me every time<br/>
I hit them(buggy). There&#39;s no real quests that I saw for this, but I did<br/>
read a solution to doing it, it&#39;s not really a kosher way of completing the<br/>
quest. People just made an Erudite Paladin and after killing the shark would<br/>
log back in with the &quot;mule&quot;, loot and then complete the quest. :-P<br/>
<br/>
I basically decided not to do it and have stuck to the bronze breastplate<br/>
that I have. I&#39;m just a lute short of getting a lambent breastplate so I&#39;m<br/>
not as motivated to complete this quest as I once was.<br/>
