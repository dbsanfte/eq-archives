<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] A theory on clarity <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895537981">My bard is my back up char. I play a 49 shaman. Dumdar. Well we took the<br/>
kings room the other day. With a very unblanced team. 3 shamans 1 enchanter<br/>
1 ranger 1 bard and a wizard. Well the king was up when we took the room.<br/>
With clarity and the bard singing the mana song and all 3 shamans<br/>
cnablinzing and regening hp. It was like none stop mana. I went oom<br/>
personaly 4 times in that fight and was at 60% befor I could blink. Thats<br/>
when I made a bard btw. A combo of the 3 made for quick mana and none stop<br/>
fighting.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I&#39;ve had the opportunity to play a shaman recently (level 49), and noticed<br/>
&gt; that mana/health regens at 6 second (&quot;tick&quot;) intervals.  At first I<br/>
&gt; thought Cannibalism to be inefficient, but after discovering this I found<br/>
&gt; timing the stand -&gt; cast -&gt; sit pattern between ticks, I could use both<br/>
&gt; effectively (med and cann).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe clarity (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus) puts a &quot;clarity counter&quot; on<br/>
&gt; everyone in the group.  When the tick occurs, the counter is removed and<br/>
&gt; additional mana is granted to the holder.  This would explain why it is<br/>
&gt; possible to weave one other song in addition to clarity without diluting<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s effectiveness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was thinking about this topic because I don&#39;t like the common ideology<br/>
&gt; of &quot;direct mana addition per pulse,&quot; when starting/stopping the song<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t add anything over simply singing it straight (despite the doubled<br/>
&gt; number of pulses).  The big question, of course, is: Will the Cantata of<br/>
&gt; Replenishment stack with the Chorus of Clarity?<br/>
