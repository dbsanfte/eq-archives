<b>Subject:</b> Kiting a problem and Lullaby in CB <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-961848170">As I am reading the digest I will comment on two issues here hope you dont<br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
First Kiting.. I have kited a couple of blue Griffawns (boy they hit HARD),<br/>
but generally dont see much kiting happening, so I dont think its that big<br/>
a problem. IF Verant decides to go live with this change, I really dont<br/>
think it will help on people who are training others with bad kiting<br/>
tactics or just for the heck of it. It will proberly stop exp. kiting, but<br/>
as others have mentioned I dont think that is a major problem(?)<br/>
All in all I think that it sounds like a very bad sollution to a non<br/>
existing problem. If they want people to stop kiting it should happen by<br/>
improving AI.. Anyone ever kiting casters?<br/>
<br/>
Ahh Lullaby one of my favorits ). I have also been standing around in CB at<br/>
level 18 and 19 playing lullaby and its really no problem unless someone<br/>
pulls the castle and dvinn. Btw I love the way Lul interrupts casters ).<br/>

an eye on what&#39;s around me, I frequently will stand next to a mass-melee<br/>
with the Lullaby going, just to irritate the orcs ;)  While I often end up<br/>
with 4-8 angry orcs on me, it&#39;s never more than I saw (they don&#39;t &quot;come out<br/>
of the woodwork&quot;) and usually I don&#39;t have any real problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what I&#39;m doing differently?<br/>
