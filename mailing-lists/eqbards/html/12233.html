<div id="ygrps-yiv-861612206">Heh well actually my 50 necromancer is in the backseat and I rarely play<br/>
him. In fact I&#39;m not even sure what level he is now he could be 50 or 49.<br/>
Basically it gets real old after awhile especially being a necro where I can<br/>
never really hunt in sol b I basically soloed in Guk non stop or grouped<br/>
with guild members. The place is just too crowded. Guk was so much more fun<br/>
in the days where you couldn&#39;t walk from bed room to exe room let alone the<br/>
current walk from the bedroom to the lord room without invis. It&#39;s just not<br/>
near as fun with 80 people in zone. Personally I wish they would make a<br/>
exact copy of the zone and put it s0omehwere else lie say near high pass.<br/>
Personally it&#39;s not very hard to gain exp once you hit 49 but that&#39;s mainly<br/>
because I&#39;m a necro and can solo extremly well past 49. One rule for me<br/>
though I can not lose 49 because below that levle I just plain suck. Ahh<br/>
well I like my secondaries and I pull my necro out from time to time.<br/>

&gt;Not a hell level?  How long has it taken you to reach 51? &lt;eg&gt; Ok, since I<br/>
&gt;am talking totally out of hearsay, rumor and second hand info (ie my<br/>

&gt;do.&#39;  My 50 fiends say &quot;no reason to play sonso unless going on a good<br/>
&gt;raid...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And yet I see others going to same places Lguk, SolB and shouting for<br/>
&gt;groups.  So my comment on 50 being ultimate hell was more about that stuff<br/>
&gt;than the rate that you gain xp - although I was told its pretty boring to<br/>
&gt;build xp at 50.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d love to hear from you (all you 50&#39;s) more about what it&#39;s really like.<br/>
