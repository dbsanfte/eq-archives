&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Gives 10 STR<br/>
&gt; 2) Gives 8 HP Regen per tick<br/>
&gt; 3) Gives small rune against casters (haven&#39;t determined exact value yet,<br/>
&gt; must do more testing)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I take it that&#39;s at 50.  At 47 I got 7 hp/tick without a lute<br/>
(6 hp/tick after subtracting natural regen rate), and 13<br/>
hp/tick with a lute (12 hp/tick after subtracting natural<br/>
regen rate).<br/>
<br/>
The spell shield is there, albeit minor.  Bellow yourself and<br/>
see how much damage you take (unfortunately, you don&#39;t seem to<br/>
get the &quot;hit by X points non-melee damage&quot; message when you<br/>
Bellow yourself).  It reduced the damage I took by about 15<br/>
with a lute equipped; tough to tell since it was mixed with<br/>
the client updates.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It does not stack with any of our damage shield songs, but it does stack<br/>

&gt; Speedup and a small rune when twisting during battle at level 50, not bad at<br/>
&gt; all!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The test I did with the Allizesaur (involving over an hour of<br/>
weapon swings, about 30 minutes for each case) found no<br/>
difference between 87 str and 161 str.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll<br/>
ever play Chant again except when people are encumbered, or<br/>
I&#39;m grouped with 3 bards.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Better still, between battles if you really must be the healer at that<br/>
&gt; level, it stacks with Hymn of Restoration as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where I really see this song shining.  Before, I was a<br/>
bit disappointed that druids were about as good a healer over<br/>
time as we were, and they could do it with just a single cast.  <br/>
Now we can easily outperform their healing over time.  Also,<br/>
it was getting annoying having to sing Hymn for almost two<br/>
minutes to fill up a single bubble on a buffed tank.<br/>
<br/>
The healing aspect of this song makes it a winner not just for<br/>
us, but for all the other players as it&#39;ll help cut down on<br/>
downtime some more.  If there is some method to Verant&#39;s<br/>
madness, it seems to be towards nerfing our enchanter-like<br/>
abilities, and making downtime reduction our specialty.  <br/>
Unfortunately, that would seem to be a rather boring job...<br/>
