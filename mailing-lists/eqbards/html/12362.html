<div id="ygrps-yiv-458025"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; To bad me blacklisting someone in my book doesn&#39;t mean anything ;-).  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; got a list of about 10 KS&#39;ers and 2 &quot;Ninja&quot; looters.  I tend to only party<br/>
&gt; with people I know or people from my guild now.  I hate that bad taste in my<br/>
&gt; mouth when I get screwed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It really means nothing to anyone, however if they want Harmonic on<br/>
  the team, they usually listen to me.  Consequently, the people on the<br/>
  list I have are the same ones as the people who leads the majority of<br/>
  the events, go figure.  We&#39;ve got good taste in bad people, lol.<br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the people that have KS&#39;d me didn&#39;t know it was me, since I<br/>
  was in different form.  I just write down their name, and let them<br/>
  do their thing ;)<br/>
