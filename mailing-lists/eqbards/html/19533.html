<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222927265">&quot;North Wall&quot; of Karnor&#39;s is MY preferred place to hunt - the XP is high -<br/>
and deaths minimal.  The only time I died was returning from helping someone<br/>
from a corpse retrieval.  Picked up 2 giants - and made the mistake of going<br/>
into the dead-end area of &quot;Ruins&quot; near the entry way to Karnor&#39;s trying to<br/>
get to the zone (my Bad).<br/>
<br/>
My guild mates who are a tad higher level than me (45-48) prefer to hunt<br/>
Hornets in Burning Wood - but I seem to attract them like flies on<br/>
(you-know-what) and seem to die at least once every attempt - so I leave<br/>
them to that while I get &quot;Pick-up&quot; Groups (in quotes because it&#39;s become<br/>
pretty regularly who I&#39;ve been grouping with) at the North Wall...<br/>

I don&#39;t know about loot, but I sure had a good time last night in the<br/>
dreadlands outside Karanor&#39;s Castle.<br/>
<br/>
Myself and a few other folks from my guild who are plodding through hell #45<br/>
were amazed at the relative XP gain we saw there...it was my first time<br/>
really getting down and dirty in Kunark and it was a blast.<br/>
<br/>
I may make it through 45 after all...<br/>
