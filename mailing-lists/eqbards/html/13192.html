<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984629996">Stop suffering from class envy!  We are bards, be proud of who<br/>
we are.  If you feel that the bard is in some way weaker than<br/>
the other classes, lets come up with the unique, &quot;only a bard..&quot;<br/>
solution.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t bind.  We don&#39;t gate.  We don&#39;t disarm.  We play songs.<br/>
<br/>
How about instruments that double as weapons, etc.   Drums that<br/>
when played look like different instruments.  The bard is the class<br/>
that could most have a unique solution.<br/>
<br/>
Play a bard because its different, not because it is just another<br/>
clone of every other class.</div>
