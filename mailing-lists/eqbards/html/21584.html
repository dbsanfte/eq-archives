  Subject: [eqbards] Niv&#39;s graphic???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Something I noticed last night... can someone confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
  During some downtime last night I was doing this twist hymn, niv&#39;s, mana<br/>
song till others wear off and I noticed that when I did Niv&#39;s I flung my<br/>
arms out as if casting a spell instead of strumming my lute?<br/>
<br/>
  I am using a gupsy lute... the 5%, +5 MR lute.  I later confirmed that<br/>
everytime I played niv&#39;s with that lute... I flung my arms out.  I will test<br/>
it with other strings, but another bard got the correct graphic when using<br/>
his 7-string...<br/>
<br/>
  Has this been around for awhile or what?<br/>
