<div id="ygrps-yiv-805887671">actually, there&#39;s a quest you can do really quick with selo&#39;s or sow in<br/>
rivervale (no zoning), the turnip delivery quest, I got a druid to 11 doing<br/>
it on test server once, he was very very warmly when i stopped doing it.<br/>

gain by killing Goblins, Mooto and Deathfist Orcs; and by turning belts in <br/>
to Deputy Budo, and goblin warbeads in to Sheriff Roglio.  My Halfling <br/>
Druid (who STARTED amiable) took weeks to complete it.  Talies, on the <br/>
other hand, has a looong way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the ring is a one-shot Healing (100 hp), so really it&#39;s an <br/>
emergency-only toy for lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
The ring can be &quot;recharged&quot; by giving it to Hendi Mrubble in the Cleric&#39;s <br/>
Guild in Rivervale, but you have to have even MORE ungodly faction to do<br/>
that.<br/>
