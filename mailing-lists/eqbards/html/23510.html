<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499860168">I&#39;ve myself have tried both 75% and 100% and haven&#39;t noticed a difference. I think Verant fixed the acceleration problem with it. I had to load the latest drivers for it though to fix other weird sound problems that I had been having.<br/>
<br/>
As for everyone&#39;s comments about the possible problems that the computer has been having, I&#39;d have to agree. Over time some of the hardware may have been fried despite the robust cooling system. <br/>
<br/>
You might want to reinstall the OS though, just to make sure. It&#39;d probably be wise to make a Ghost image (if you have access to Norton Ghost) of your primary partition, then wipe your primary partition and reinstall your OS. That way, if it turns out it wasn&#39;t your OS, you can just restore the ghost image and not have to reinstall all of your apps.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Win 2k, I&#39;ve run EQ on both and it seems fine on Win 2k. But for now, I&#39;d recommend sticking to 98se unless you like riding the bleeding edge of gaming. :-)<br/>

&gt; hmmm, if i am overheating its because fan is dead, because i have a huge<br/>
&gt; cooling system in it.  I bought a 3 fan/heat sink from computernerd.com.  My<br/>
&gt; buddies at their computer store were in shock when they saw it.  I used to<br/>
&gt; run temperature software, and it ran cooler then the original fan/not<br/>
&gt; overclocked.  The SB live has the latest drivers. I also have an extra fan<br/>
&gt; installed in the front of the pc case.  Its getting gutted tonight to see<br/>
&gt; what is going on.<br/>

&gt; If you have SB Live - the prob could also be there - but I&#39;m guessing heat<br/>
&gt; is your problem.  If you over clock - I&#39;d strongly recommend make making<br/>
&gt; sure you have a heat sensor and monitoring software.  Fan cooling and<br/>
&gt; airflow is very important.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the positive side - you can get a replacement Celeron relatively cheap.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW - as far as comments on Win 98/ME being faster than 2000 - 2000 has a<br/>
&gt; lot more &quot;protection&quot; which comes at a cost processor cycle wise.  Assuming<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t specifically need some of 2000&#39;s features not avail in 95/98/ME<br/>
&gt; (networking for example) - you have to choose between stability or speed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t worked with ME very long - but if Micro$oft can make it&#39;s dates -<br/>
&gt; &quot;Whistler&quot; will replace it - their new Consumer OS based on the NT kernel -<br/>
&gt; so it very well may be short-lived.<br/>

&gt; Hate to say it Minkin but the processor is likely toast.  Once overheating<br/>
&gt; begins it is a rapidly accelerating process and you generally never regain<br/>
&gt; the original state.  I had one of my machines do this that was overclocked<br/>
&gt; and it would never run cool again.  I haven&#39;t overclocked since after mine<br/>
&gt; and my friends both went down in the same week.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this is OT, but its driving me nuts. gotta get back ingame asap<br/>
&gt; before i get withdrawal symptoms.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a celeron 300 overclocked at 466 running on an abit bh6 or bx6 mother<br/>
&gt; board for about 2 years now runnin on win98. Run a voodoo 3000 vid card and<br/>
&gt; an sb live, oh and a 1* 128meg sim of 100mhz ram.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my problem, I pretty much only play EQ, check email and surf.  Lately<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve had a few solid lockups playing eq, some crashes to desktop as well.<br/>
&gt; Yesterday i got 2 in 10-15 minutes and the day before i died while kiting<br/>
&gt; due to this (grrr)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, I tried deinstalling EQ, reinstalling EQ, RoK and SoV.  While<br/>
&gt; reinstalling SoV, total lockup again.  This indicated to me that probably my<br/>
&gt; pc is overheating or something.  Another thing i&#39;ve noticed while playing is<br/>
&gt; that my graphics seem to be choppier than normal (more vid lag, and its not<br/>
&gt; swarmcaller) (which indicates to me processing problems).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So... Tonight I&#39;m going to probably rip the pc open, check if my fan is<br/>
&gt; still working, if it is i&#39;ll proceed to downclock the cpu back to 300 like<br/>
&gt; its supposed to be.  If my pc is still acting up from there i&#39;ll reinstall<br/>
&gt; win98 (arg i hate doing this, takes forever with all my apps).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the prob may be, I have a<br/>
&gt; feeling my cpu might be nearing retirement but i&#39;m really hoping this isnt<br/>
&gt; the case because i dont have the cash to buy a new chip/board cause that<br/>
&gt; would run me about 350$ canadian for a 700mhz/board<br/>
