Well EV... if you want to upgrade your system you may be better off doing<br/>
the processor and memory only at this point.  Question is:<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what chipset is on your board?  If it&#39;s an Intel BX-440 Chipset<br/>
it will support processors all the way up to the PIII - 1000 so you could<br/>
feasibly just upgrade your processor to a PIII and stick another 64mb of ram<br/>
in it.<br/>
<br/>
Even if it&#39;s an older board, with all you&#39;ve done to it already, you&#39;d be<br/>
better off just getting a board, processor and another stick of 64mb ram.<br/>
It&#39;ll save you a ton of money over buying a whole new system when you only<br/>
really need a memory and processor upgrade.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Something wrong with a PII 200 with 64 MB RAM?  Heh heh.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Your best cost/benefit upgrade would be another 64meg of RAM,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that should<br/>
&gt; &gt; improve things a LOT.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; Yeah, I priced that out a while back and have been putting it off.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; already upgraded the modem (to a winmodem of all things!  F1 /bonk), the<br/>
&gt; hard drive (it&#39;s a bad sign when you have to delete Powerpoint to fit<br/>
&gt; Everquest), the sound card, and countless drivers.  I feel like I&#39;m<br/>
sinking<br/>
&gt; time and money into a junk car at this point.  So my intention is to live<br/>
&gt; with it for a while longer then splurge on a whole new unit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But anyway, that doesn&#39;t alter the fact that Blackburrow is laggier than<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; other low level zone (except perhaps low-level RoK zones) and still seems<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; odd choice for a bard to hunt in.  Tszaaz, do you experience lag<br/>
ANYWHERE???<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; You have gotten better at client prediction (55)<br/>

&gt; Pain and suffering hit YOU for 5 points!<br/>
&gt; You were injured by running smack into a wall that you were unable to<br/>
steer<br/>
&gt; away from<br/>
&gt; You tell the group, &quot;zoning&quot;<br/>

&gt; You have entered Qeynos Hills<br/>

&gt; Heh<br/>
