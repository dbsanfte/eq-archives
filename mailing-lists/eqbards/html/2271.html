<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985448533">Root and Selo&#39;s....  It ALWAYS has worked for me, regardless of whether the<br/>
root was on ME, or ANY of my party!!   I think this is a GREAT benefit, and<br/>
hope Verant does not remove it &quot;as a bug&quot;. I&#39;ve had 2 or 3 members of my<br/>
party rooted, all of them shouting &quot;rooted!&quot; and then I throw the song up,<br/>
ALL are released at the same time!  The many &quot;Thank you&#39;s&quot;  I receive make<br/>
me feel like a valuable member of the team!<br/>
<br/>
As for mutliple bards, I have frequently travelled with one other bard in a<br/>
group. We always work out a &quot;you play these songs because you are higher<br/>
level, I play these&quot; routine, and it works well unless something bad happens<br/>
to one of us in combat (one of us dies, one of us forced to zone, etc).  My<br/>
DREAM is to travel with a party full of SIX bards on day, if even for a<br/>
short time. THAT would be a lot of fun! heheheh!<br/>

&gt;Hello!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Last night Roop (a fellow bard) and I were grouping with a party in<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, I thought that Selo&#39;s only broke a root spell on the bard who<br/>
&gt;sings it, not on the party members. Any confirmation on this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, you&#39;re absolutely right about multiple bards in a group. Also, an<br/>
&gt;entire group of bards is pretty interesting in a fight when you get to the<br/>
&gt;lvl 15 and above range. You MUST coordinate your songs, but if you take the<br/>
&gt;time to do so, you can do some amazing things in combat. </span></blockquote></div>
