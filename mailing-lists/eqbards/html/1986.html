<div id="ygrps-yiv-772454125">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I have done the Lisera quest.  Nostrolo was at the fountain in South Karana<br/>
when I found him.  It&#39;s not real far from the bridge from North Karana but I<br/>
did end up searching the whole zone a couple times before I got it.  If you<br/>
want a complete spoiler, email me and I think I can dig the loc from my<br/>
notes or just give you more detailed instructions on how to find it.  It&#39;s<br/>
not hard once you know what and where to look.  Then as long as he is alive,<br/>
you should have no trouble.  He gets killed for reasons unknown to me but<br/>
probably affiliated with another quest.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like Verant has quests woven together to form some sort of rough<br/>
story line?  Besides this one where the lute guy needs his lute yet he also<br/>
needs to be killed, there is Gnasher Gnoll who makes the BB Stouts but also<br/>
needs to be killed by others for some reason.  And Furball Miller who is a<br/>
gnoll adopted son and lives on the Miller farm in West Karanas with some<br/>
deep tales of woe.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if they have some sort of overall plan to tie everything together<br/>
or if they are just loosely overlapping some things to make use of the<br/>
resources they have (ie low level npcs at various stations for players to<br/>
zap.)<br/>
<br/>
The other night I saw two 20+ PC&#39;s attack and kill Ulnus MacManus at the<br/>
barbarian fishing village in West Karanas.  I asked they why they killed him<br/>
and they said that he is an oaf and they hate him for keeping the wolf<br/>
penned up (druid quest or what?)<br/>

<br/>
		Hello there all! I have a few questions that arose during my<br/>
adventure<br/>
		today....<br/>
<br/>
		1) I have a Lute called &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; or<br/>
something like that.<br/>
		Does anyone know if it has any significance? Is it just a<br/>
quest item? I<br/>
		tried using it, and it works in all respects (that I could<br/>
tell) like a<br/>
		normal Lute. Nothing special. I did notice that I could sell<br/>
it for almost 4<br/>
		plat, where a normal lute doesn&#39;t make it to 1 plat. Any<br/>
ideas?<br/>
<br/>
		2) I also just picked up &quot;Lisera&quot;, a lute that a bard in<br/>
Qeynos needs<br/>
		tuning. He says that I need to take it to someone named<br/>
Nostrolo in the<br/>
		&quot;Karanas&quot;. But, I looked and looked and could not FINFD This<br/>
Nostrolo<br/>
		person. Is this a broken quest, or have I just missed this<br/>
fella? Could<br/>
		someone give me an idea where to look for Nostrolo? Also, is<br/>
Lisera a lute<br/>
		you should KEEP, meaning is IT better than a regular Lute?<br/>
<br/>
		3) Does anyone know of a site that has descriptions of what<br/>
songs do above<br/>
		24th level??<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks for all your help!!<br/>
