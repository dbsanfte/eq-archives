<div id="ygrps-yiv-311842949">Hehe..I think it&#39;s great that some people really get into this detail stuff.<br/>
I think it&#39;s you guys who have really pushed through a lot of the beneficial<br/>
changes to the game.  However, as much as I appreciate it, I don&#39;t get it.<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Too much like work!  Personally, I get in the game, and do whatever is fun.<br/>
I have every character slot full, and I play whichever one strikes my fancy.<br/>
It just so happens that 98% of the time it&#39;s Atonal that gets played,<br/>
well..except lately...been playing my druid a lot...but that&#39;s about to<br/>
change...just as soon as my drums are fixed.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Atonal<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re curious, my other chars:<br/>
19 HE Cleric<br/>
19 HLF Druid<br/>
10 Iksar SK<br/>
10 Iksar Nec<br/>
6 HE Mage<br/>
3 DE Nec<br/>
2 Hum War<br/>
 heh...  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; which COULD be the case depending on how verant programs level <br/>
 </span></blockquote>checks.  if they really have a separate experience table to check <br/>
against for each value of experience penalty, i.e. one for troll <br/>
sk&#39;s, one for iksar monks, etc, etc, then the system they have works <br/>
fine. if they create one experience table and &#39;&#39;normalize&#39;&#39; <br/>
experience to it, i.e. calculate experience by this formula:  <br/>
Exp_gained = Base_exp * class_pen * race_pen, then they have really <br/>
just moved the penalty, although it is much more easily avoided, as <br/>
in get a rez or just don&#39;t die.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you show me an example with your above formula to show how the <br/>
penalty would be moved?  I&#39;m don&#39;t grasp the concept you&#39;re stating <br/>
with just the formula.<br/>
