<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974020361">Well I have to disagree.  I thought the same thing until a guildmate gave me<br/>
one.  The 5/18 is a very good ratio, slightly better than the claws.  And<br/>
the proc isn&#39;t bad if you know when to stop using the weapon.  I use this in<br/>
my offhand with claws in my primary and I swear I never stop swinging.  If<br/>
we get pulls of more than one, I always unequip it and put an obsidian shard<br/>
or some other weapon in my secondary.  So it isn&#39;t that bad of a weapon if<br/>
you just remember when not to use it.<br/>

  You will be disappointed I fear.  The proc is a level 8 wizard spell that<br/>
  does 28 points of AoE damage centered on the user.  Can you say<br/>
  demezmerizing mega-taunt?  I thought you could.<br/>
<br/>
  At least its great if you get surrounded by a horde of moss snakes you<br/>
  couldn&#39;t Lullaby while doing some testing to prove just that.<br/>
