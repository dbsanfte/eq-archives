<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385642453">I&#39;d like to hear more details if you would share them. What mob? What songs?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go out on a limb and guess that it would be a song that interrupts the<br/>
mob&#39;s casting.  At least that&#39;s the only way I can think of it being an<br/>
effective tactic.  And even so - why melee with the mob for 1 and 2 points<br/>
of damage at the risk of getting hit and stunned.  The mob is either gonna<br/>
be on you or on the wizzie depending on who it hates most.  And the wizzie<br/>
is going to deal more damage so I&#39;d be playing the Lament to keep clearing<br/>
the mobs hate parade. <br/>

		     In general I agree completely, that is why I didn&#39;t buy<br/>
the gloves.  <br/>
		     Having said that there was one situation where HtH was<br/>
very useful.  <br/>
		     In a two person group where your partner is a caster.<br/>
You need to <br/>
		     tank to keep the mob off the caster but (s)he has<br/>
decided that your <br/>
		     more effective with you instruments equipped.  It<br/>
worked amazingly <br/>
		     well for 3 hours, a level, and 20pp.  (I did minimal<br/>
damage with HtH <br/>
		     but that wasn&#39;t the point)  Amazing how many different<br/>
wrinkles to <br/>
		     this game I keep discovering...<br/>

		Have you ever tried hand to hand combat?  Go into a newbie<br/>
zone and pick a <br/>
		fight with an orc pawn or a gnoll pup.  They cant hurt you<br/>
because of your <br/>
		ac and your hp rebuilds faster than they can damage you.<br/>
But you will be <br/>
		punching them for 1 point of damage.  Now you should be<br/>
getting into groups <br/>
		where they are attacking monsters that are so much higher<br/>
than you that your <br/>
		normal weps are having trouble damaging them.  Your role in<br/>
that case will <br/>
		be equiping an instrument and playing songs. So magic gloves<br/>
and hand to <br/>
		hand combat with monsters that you can barley hit with a<br/>
Dirk or Combine are <br/>
		not gonna do any good.  Even lower level monsters that your<br/>
regular weps can <br/>
		hit will be hitting you and your party pretty hard.  If you<br/>
are in the <br/>
		melee, you will be at risk of getting stunned and not having<br/>
your songs be <br/>
		used all of the time.  And you will get beat up for no gain.<br/>
My 2cp &lt;g&gt;<br/>
		     <br/>
		You would be better off standing off outside of melee and<br/>
supporting your <br/>
		party 100% of the time (no stuns to interupt you).<br/>
		     <br/>
		Sylly.<br/>
		     <br/>
		p.s. I could be wrong - I have only had 2 or 3 partys and<br/>
monster combos <br/>
		where I was able to do this stand off support role.  but I<br/>
have done the h2h <br/>
		combat thing and it was pitiful!<br/>

		                     The other day someone offered me Black<br/>
iron gloves.  He<br/>
		claimed that <br/>
		                     they gave you the ability to punch<br/>
magical only<br/>
		creatures.  Low AC, no <br/>
		                     stat adjustment, 5lb weight and high<br/>
price dissuaded me<br/>
		from buying <br/>
		                     them.   I&#39;ve been thinking (ouch)<br/>
though,  maybe they<br/>
		would be handy <br/>
		                     for those times that you play support<br/>
bard and<br/>
		contribute some kung fu <br/>
		                     to the fight.  What do you all think?<br/>
