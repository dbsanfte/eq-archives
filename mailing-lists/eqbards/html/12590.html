<div id="ygrps-yiv-608699510">If you&#39;re by Freeport my recommendation is Northern Ro. One of my favorite<br/>
places. Orcs, desert tarantulas, scarabs, snakes, madmen and eventually<br/>
cutthroats, zombies, mummies and dune tarantulas. The commons is nearby too,<br/>
and you kind find a lot to fight out there if you like a little more variety<br/>
(and don&#39;t want to carry so much milk/water).<br/>
<br/>
Oasis is nearby also and is good place when you get higher fighting the<br/>
various loot-poor gators (doesn&#39;t sound like you need the loot).<br/>
<br/>
Near Qeynos there&#39;s Everfrost, I&#39;d avoid Blackburrow (which is way to<br/>
crowded for my tastes) during peak times.<br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself in the Butcherblock mountains, there&#39;s the orc camp<br/>
which didn&#39;t seem to be as camped as it used to (Bertoxxulous server).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing a lot of other characters and have a small low level guild<br/>
who tries to maintain some low level characters so we can play with some of<br/>
our friends who have just started, so I&#39;ve been hunting at this level<br/>
recently. Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; That is the problem I am facing... I have a lvl 50 necro on Veeshan. <br/>
&gt; Unfortunatly Veeshan is owned by FoH so dragon runes are not <br/>
&gt; a possibility. <br/>
&gt; Both dragons are either Gm slain within 10 mins of server <br/>
&gt; coming up or FoH <br/>
&gt; has a group or 18-24 people posted outside the FG and ICE <br/>
&gt; giant area making <br/>
&gt; final preps for going in. Only rarely does FoH miss an <br/>
&gt; oppertunity to kill <br/>
&gt; the dragons or a god. That&#39;s why I started my bard twink heh. <br/>
&gt; Not much to do <br/>
&gt; wwith my necr. BTW off topic, but what are some good lvling <br/>
&gt; areas for a <br/>
&gt; semi-twinked (still wanna learn to play the class as <br/>
&gt; intended) lvl 8 bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Klayan Deathbringer (The Oracle) lvl 50 Necro<br/>
&gt; Celantra (The Oracle) lvl 8 semi-twink Bard<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never said or felt that you were an idiot, but I <br/>
&gt; have noticed in <br/>
&gt; &gt;recent<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weeks that your attitude toward other players whos level <br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t caused <br/>
&gt; &gt;them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a nosebleed (under 49 apparently) has deteriorated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Only on dragon raids and plane trips, you&#39;ll notice.  I <br/>
&gt; cannot stress<br/>
&gt; &gt;   waiting on dragon raids.  Cause there ain&#39;t nothing else <br/>
&gt; left after you<br/>
&gt; &gt;   do them.  Make the level, and then kick back on dragons.  <br/>
&gt; Otherwise,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you aren&#39;t gonna get anything else out of the game.  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; having great<br/>
&gt; &gt;   fun doing dragon planning and raiding planes.  After you make L50,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I&#39;ve realized that the strain of making levels is lifted, <br/>
&gt; and you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;   enjoy the game much more.  Again, that&#39;s my take on it as people<br/>
&gt; &gt;   often like to disagree with me.  But there is no excitement after<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you&#39;ve done it all, in my opinion.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Harm.<br/>
