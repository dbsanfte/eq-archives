&gt;Please folks, realize that some of our songs can be very<br/>
&gt;annoying both in terms of spam and graphics lag (especially if<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re L24 or over) for other people.  I practiced my brass<br/>
&gt;skill in Crushbone (when others weren&#39;t around) and fighting<br/>
&gt;aqua goblins in the Cauldron, where I was almost always alone<br/>
&gt;(though a few people decided I &quot;needed&quot; help when they saw me<br/>
&gt;at the entrance to Unrest seemingly not fighting while these<br/>
&gt;goblins were beating up on me).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;lol&gt; I was in West Commonlands yesterday, and got 2 dervs<br/>
instead of one (she was hiding behind a tent).  Of course I <br/>
kicked in lullaby, and just focused on one.  Then a couple of <br/>
people showed up to help, and I had to point out to them that<br/>
the 2nd derv wasn&#39;t even taking a swing at me.  When they<br/>
realized that, they just sat back and watched :)  &quot;Nice show&quot;<br/>
one said, and the other tossed a heal on me.</div>
