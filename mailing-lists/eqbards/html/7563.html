<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849314110"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; it doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not pure casters. At level<br/>
&gt; 50, a cleric/shaman/druid will be just as useful meleeing<br/>
&gt; as a wizard is, which is to say, not at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not the point. A pure caster is a pure caster from<br/>
birth to death. Just because you *choose* not to melee,<br/>
whether it&#39;s because you&#39;re not as good at it -anymore-<br/>
as you used to be or because you do better in your other<br/>
ability (casting), does not change the fact that you can<br/>
still wear armor, you can still use multiple weapons and<br/>
you can still melee in a pinch better than any caster could<br/>
dream of.</div>
