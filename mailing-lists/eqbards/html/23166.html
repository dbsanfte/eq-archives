<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036305766">He was refering to the fact that now rogues and warrior has a much lower<br/>
difference in xp as compared to the other melee types.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior/Rogue use to need 90 xp compared with 140 for Pal, SK, Rang and 120<br/>
for monk.<br/>
Now they need 90, but the others only need 100.<br/>
<br/>
So in theory they are now a less desirable class than they were before.<br/>
Relative to other classes...</div>
