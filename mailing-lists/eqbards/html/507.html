<b>Subject:</b> Unique bard items <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-165109670">Personally I think bards are getting the short end of the stick<br/>
when it comes to unique items.  Paladins have the Flaming Two-Handed Sword<br/>
and 4 or 5 others, Shadowknights the same, of course all the casters have<br/>
special items as well that boost mana or other things.<br/>
<br/>
	But we bards have no BARD-SPECIFIC or even bard-flavored items<br/>
that I know of.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have a special drum that gave<br/>
maybe a 10% boost to the Accelerando?  Or perhaps a fabled mandolin that<br/>
could instead of merely boosting the healing song, also remove disease or<br/>
poison or any adverse effects?  Heck, a weapon that acted as an instrument<br/>
would be great, as well.  Bone bladed lute?  Well, maybe scratch that one,<br/>
eh?<br/>
<br/>
Later all, may your songs lift to the stars!<br/>
