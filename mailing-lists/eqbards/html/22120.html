<b>Subject:</b> 39th charm song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546628932">I started playing my bard again after a 4 month break.  The lute strings<br/>
required a little fine tuning but it wasn&#39;t too hard to get back in the<br/>
swing of things.  One thing I did have trouble with was using this song.<br/>
<br/>
I had just dinged into 39 when I stopped playing the first time.  So I never<br/>
had the opportunity to use this song.  Here is the problem I had.  Group<br/>
would pull two mobs and I would charm the second one.  I would get the eyes<br/>
glaze over message.  I would then target the first mob and give the /pet<br/>
attack command.  Problem is my pet just stood there and did not attack.  I<br/>
kept hitting /pet attack on several occasions but I could never get it to<br/>
work.  In this situation, the mob we were attacking never attacked me.  <br/>
<br/>
So then later on I tried it again.  Different scenario this time.  Puller<br/>
agrroed two mobs and snared one.  So the second mob took longer to arrive at<br/>
the party.  I was attacking first mob, buffing party etc before the second<br/>
mob got there.  I charmed second mob when it arrived, initial mob attacked<br/>
me, and then my pet responded and started attacking the first mob.  After<br/>
charm wore off and I recharmed it, it automatically attacked the first mob<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Not certain why I could not get my charmed mob to attack in the first<br/>
situation.  Besides the mana drain, is there a difference how the 39 charm<br/>
works compared to the original version?<br/>
