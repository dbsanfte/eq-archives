<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414900216">So you guys use a point system?  I seem to remember talking about this in a<br/>
thread a while back.  We have discussed using points on and off but it<br/>
always comes down to the fear that they won&#39;t be assigned uniformly and also<br/>
that nobody would want the responsibility of maintaining such a thing.   We<br/>
use more of a deferment system.. aka peer pressure.. which seems to work<br/>
most of the time, though.  Do you like the point system? Can you use point<br/>
for any item you want or does it have to be an item that is &quot;clearly&quot; for<br/>
your class?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and SW dropped that hammer, but one of those dang ogre-type shaman won<br/>
it!   And we did not have such good luck with Hoshie this weekend, 2 wizards<br/>
do not a death squad make....<br/>

&gt; sweet, we got a pair of those shoes last night too.  speaking <br/>
&gt; of drops =)<br/>
&gt; silly me, i went ahead and used some points on a Dragon Claw <br/>
&gt; Main Gauche off<br/>
&gt; SW (2 dropped, only myself and a ranger wanted them).  i am <br/>
&gt; very low on<br/>
&gt; points after getting my SSS, so i just wanted something from VP just<br/>
&gt; because, ya know to have SOMETHING hehe, not that this sword <br/>
&gt; ain&#39;t nice.<br/>
&gt; so then next thing i know Hosh comes along and i use some <br/>
&gt; more points on a<br/>
&gt; Veldrak&#39;s Shortblade! (no one wanted it)  now i don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; which to use!<br/>
&gt; (have to keep SSS in primary hand).  ya i know i got it rough =p<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SW drops a nice hammer for ya Halana, good luck in there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; monk hubby (hush all you eq-love cynics!) got some great <br/>
&gt; &gt; haste slippers.. us<br/>
