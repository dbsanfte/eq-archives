&gt; &gt; Yes Lord Grimlot gives you nothing back for the Lute, he <br/>
&gt; equips it when you<br/>
&gt; &gt; give it to him.  That is not the Wakizashi quest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You were playing your dark elf SK when you tested, right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, i had a dark elf necro in south karana come talk to grimlot.  i was KOS,<br/>
he was amiable.  the site that had the wakizishi linked to grimlot said it<br/>
was for SK or Necro.  I am not sure, but wouldn&#39;t grimlot just not talk at<br/>
all to you about the quest if you weren&#39;t the right race/class?  do you<br/>
think he would talk about his lost love&#39;s bones to a dark elf necro, but<br/>
talk about the lute to a dark elf SK?  i doubt it, and being told by many<br/>
how to really get the wakizishi,having nothing to do with grimlot, i figure<br/>
grimlot is not part of it.<br/>
