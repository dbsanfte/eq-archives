<div id="ygrps-yiv-491187849">could it be that they are understaffed like hundreds of other tech companies in california?<br/>
guess what, it&#39;s easy to say we need 10 testers, it&#39;s another thing entirely to hire 10<br/>
qualified people to be testers.<br/>

&gt;or four months (by which time this bug has &quot;aged&quot; long enough for my comment<br/>
&gt;to be valid) - every item addressed by the testing department has been those<br/>
&gt;type of serious problems?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Secondly - it seems that there are only one or two testers for the Live<br/>
&gt;team.  IMHO this is woefully inadequate.  Doesn&#39;t Verant say they have<br/>
&gt;approx 300,000 subscribers?  Three million dollars a month revenue only buys<br/>
&gt;us two testers?  I hope there are more testers quietly working away out of<br/>
&gt;the spotlight...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway - I do believe that we need to have a certain amount of &quot;Squeaky<br/>
&gt;Wheel&quot; mentality.  Albeit politely, and no flames.  I do believe I worded my<br/>
&gt;comments in a &quot;non-whining&quot; manner. We&#39;ve been quietly, patiently waiting<br/>
&gt;for this issue to be addressed - I don&#39;t want to see it pushed to the<br/>
&gt;backburner. </span></blockquote></div>
