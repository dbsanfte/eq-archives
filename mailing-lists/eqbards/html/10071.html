i did play a wizard to level 18 in phase 3 beta, and quit him when that AC<br/>
patch came through, as he was getting his butt kicked way too much.  i<br/>
hadn&#39;t gotten the root/nuke strategy down yet.  actually was my wife who<br/>
started a bard in late phase 3 beta.  was my idea, i thought it fit her,<br/>
then i also got into the bard bigtime.  as far as final release, Shada was<br/>
started the first hour of the first day, probably same as Martyn.  i was at<br/>
electronic&#39;s boutique before they opened, and my friends and i tipped the<br/>
clerk $20 to open the boxes early =)<br/>
<br/>
