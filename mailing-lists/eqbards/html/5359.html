a high level dwarf paladin in Rivervale the other day, had a nice chat<br/>
with him, joked around a little, and before he left he handed me a<br/>
pair of these gloves for free!!<br/>
<br/>
And now I feel really bad that&#39;s how much they&#39;re worth!  Ok, it&#39;s<br/>
peanuts to him, but to me that&#39;s still rather a lot of money!!<br/>
