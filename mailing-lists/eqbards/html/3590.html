<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-207618828">Okay I have to admit that I am also guilty of twinking my mage character<br/>
with my bard who was level 16 when I started her.  At level 1 she was<br/>
given a few pieces of cloth and couple plat to start things off.  At level<br/>
4 she received some more plat and had a full set of cloth and a Giant<br/>
Snake Fang.  Nothing else since then.  All in all a minimal amount of<br/>
twinking.  Besides I would be pretty upset with myself if she started with<br/>
robe of the oracle, staff of writhing, savant cap and dusty bloodstained<br/>
gloves.  Hmmm... I saw these on a level 15 cleric in Unrest a few days<br/>
ago.  Man by twinking that much you fail to learn the qualities of your<br/>
class.  I know that I haven&#39;t even figure out half the tricks and tactics<br/>
for my mage.  By twinking I have been as bad as that bard you mentioned.<br/>

&gt; There was a guy like this on Veeshan last night in crush - folks like that<br/>
&gt; are gonna give barding a bad name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not only had he a full set of bronze/steel, and a claw - we was CONSTANTLY<br/>
&gt; auctioning for a blackened iron crown, mistmoore drum, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He was set (of course) to anon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I challenged him about it and his response was &quot;I gave up my ranger dude -<br/>
&gt; want me to just dump his stuff?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not only was he powerleveling - he hadn&#39;t the slightest idea HOW to be a<br/>
&gt; bard. He told me that &quot;I screwed up&quot; by not dumping all xtra points into<br/>
&gt; str - when I asked him if that bronze wasn&#39;t a bit heavy for a bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I informed him that no, str wasn&#39;t gonna be our primary stat - he was still<br/>
&gt; clueless. I&#39;m sure he thinks he can solo tank - also sure he&#39;ll say<br/>
&gt; &#39;barding sucks&#39; in just a few more levels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Watched him run around most of the night, not sure what level he was - but<br/>
&gt; he was still runnin from cents.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess his idea of a bard is a tank that can sing *sigh*.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other day - this lvl 1 runs up to me, basically DEMANDS I find her<br/>
&gt; corpse (it was in the newbie zone, nearly in plain sight) - I almost choked<br/>
&gt; when I saw her putting on a complete set of steel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I have a vicious streak - but it does my heart good to see both their<br/>
&gt; bodies on the ground (something that happens with a LOT more regularity<br/>
&gt; than I would have suspected).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to see anon not be available to anyone under lvl 10 or so - would<br/>
&gt; show these guys up for what they really are.  *MY* idea of helping out a<br/>
&gt; new character is patchwork, or *gasp* leather, hahaha - silly me.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Hello all,          I&#39;ve heard many Looking to buy&#39;s but I don&#39;t believe<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve  ever actually noticed anyone wearing it.       He said a  friend gave<br/>
&gt; &gt;it to him, nice gift.      No sooner had his new character spawned at the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Freeport  gates than some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked<br/>
&gt; &gt;if he wanted a  2H instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could<br/>
&gt; &gt;tell him how to say  thank you.     I  guess I&#39;m just bent because my bank<br/>
&gt; &gt;account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly  so there&#39;s no way I could buy<br/>
&gt; &gt;plate or any other really cool items  yet.   Weiland the Extremely Poor<br/>
