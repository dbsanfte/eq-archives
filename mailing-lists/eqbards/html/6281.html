<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016858706">I managed to find two cyclops in West Karana (Froon and Choon) over the <br/>
weekend.  It worked great, unfortunately I charmed the loser and had to run <br/>
to zone, lol. I went back and tried again after Froon respawned and got <br/>
killed this time when they both got on top of me due to lag and pounded me <br/>
into a bloody stain in grass.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see a funny EQ Easter Egg, go charm a Griffawn in East Karana <br/>
and command it to sit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; charm hehe).  well next two tries i killed 4 SGs without losing any <br/>
&gt;health.<br/>
&gt; &gt; its all playing selo&#39;s in between charms and timing your recharming.  i<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah.  The problem now is actually finding two like-level mobs<br/>
&gt;to play charm tricks with, and managing to keep them far<br/>
&gt;enough from other people so that they don&#39;t decide to attack<br/>
&gt;because they can&#39;t find anything else to fight.  (For some<br/>
&gt;reason most people don&#39;t seem to understand that if two mobs<br/>
&gt;are fighting each other, then someone is causing it.  They<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t see a player fighting them so they think the mobs are<br/>
&gt;free.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem yet on the younger shards (I<br/>
&gt;saw lots of giants last night on Tunare), but it&#39;s painfully<br/>
&gt;evident on the older ones.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen two giants<br/>
&gt;at once (except ice giants) in the entire last month on<br/>
&gt;Karana.  And when we did try fighting ice giants, the kill<br/>
&gt;stealers descended like flies to sh!t within a half hour.<br/>
