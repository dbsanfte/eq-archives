talked about Win95 approx 18 months ago.<br/>

Or, something I want absolutely does not support it.  :)<br/>

Oh yeah, but the list is too long and flavored with colorful adjectives to<br/>
display here. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is they support over 200 applications here and WinME apparently<br/>
has a lot of issues with drivers and conflicts.  Much of the problem seems<br/>
to stem from the total integration of Internet Explorer into the OS.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as games, he had problems with several recent titles including abrupt<br/>
system crashes, registry corruption (eek!), and hardware incompatibility.<br/>
Admittedly he is bleeding edge as far as hardware goes, what techie isn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a lot happier with Win2k but says the performance is unsatisfactory for<br/>
EQ and the sound issues drove him batty.  Stability-wise Win2k is head and<br/>
shoulders above WinME though.<br/>

&quot;WinME is an abomination that will hopefully be shortlived&quot;  This is a<br/>
direct quote from one of my techie coworkers who plays everything in sight<br/>
computer game-wise.  He&#39;s running Win2k now but not for EQ, that&#39;s still on<br/>
98.<br/>

I&#39;ve been using ME for a couple months now without any problems.  Any idea<br/>
what it is about the OS that troubles your coworker?<br/>
