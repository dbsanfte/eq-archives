<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-773509768">Given GZ&#39;s opinion that Lullaby works and his stated truisms on how it works<br/>
and their total lack of reflection in the &#39;Live&#39; game, I am thoroughly<br/>
unconvinced anyone at Verant understands bards any better than Gordon.  If<br/>
the primary spell person is so far out of touch with our spellsongs in the<br/>
&#39;Live&#39; environment, who at Verant should we expect to know how they<br/>
work?????<br/>

No it is an example of one person not knowing how our class works.   Gordon<br/>
!= Verant.</div>
