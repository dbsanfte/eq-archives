The key is that song effects linger after you stop the song, so if you get<br/>
it started, evidenced by the text for the effect, you have a minimum time<br/>
during which it will continue to work.  That time is long enough for you to<br/>
start another song (or even two) and get its effect.<br/>
<br/>
I often do two.  Doing three is indeed fairly difficult.<br/>

If Verant didn&#39;t intend it this way, they could have coded it differently<br/>
or should say it&#39;s exploitation.  Getting information out of Verant is, of<br/>
course, a rare occurance.<br/>
