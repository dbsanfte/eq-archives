<div id="ygrps-yiv-57207610">I used the combo quite effectively to get me through Hell 1 in the gobbie<br/>
mines in Ill Omen.  Just Chain &#39;em, then Screech, rinse, and repeat.  Also,<br/>
if you pull more than one MOB, make *sure* you get the Chain to stick, then<br/>
hit Screech, and watch the other critters run off, leaving you alone with<br/>
your victim (and with the way things aggro in Ill Omen, if you fear the<br/>
group off, then move backwards a few yards, that should effectively put you<br/>
out of the rest of the groups&#39; aggro range so you can kill them one by<br/>
one... oh yeah, when healing, don&#39;t sit down unless you want them to &#39;port<br/>
right on top of you).  Keep in mind, this is not an exact science, as<br/>
sometimes the whole group, or portions may come back, but if you do it<br/>
enough, it will work most of the time.<br/>
    Also, Screech is AE, so be careful that you don;t get any other MOBs<br/>
caught in it (learned that lil lesson while fighting Icy Orcs in Perma...<br/>
damn that Iceberg :oP )<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Our two main weapons...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our two main weapons are Selo&#39;s, Chains, and Screech... Our three main<br/>
&gt;weapons...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But seriously, I expect to get Screech tonite and was hoping to get some<br/>
&gt;better understanding of how I might put Screech and Chains to work in the<br/>
&gt;wide open expanses of Lake of Ill Omen and The Overthere.  Perhaps some of<br/>
&gt;the more experienced bards can shed some light on this?<br/>
