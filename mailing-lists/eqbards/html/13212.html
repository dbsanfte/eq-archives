Our songs do not FORCE us to attract attention.  Bellow all the way.  Save<br/>
the healing song for downtime reduction.  It can be done if your current<br/>
group is not adequate to protect you from harm.<br/>
<br/>
When a warrior dies, he has no sow, he has no invisibility, he has no summon<br/>
corpse spell.<br/>
<br/>
The bard has selo to speed up the travel, and has inivisibility that is<br/>
BETTER than any casters (for live stuff at least) for protecting yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Bards aren&#39;t that bad off, at all.  Bards are the best non-binder at getting<br/>
to the corpse and returning to a safe point.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Stop suffering from class envy!  We are bards, be proud of who<br/>
&gt; &gt;we are.  If you feel that the bard is in some way weaker than<br/>
&gt; &gt;the other classes, lets come up with the unique, &quot;only a bard..&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;solution.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We don&#39;t bind.  We don&#39;t gate.  We don&#39;t disarm.  We play songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;How about instruments that double as weapons, etc.   Drums that<br/>
&gt; &gt;when played look like different instruments.  The bard is the class<br/>
&gt; &gt;that could most have a unique solution.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Play a bard because its different, not because it is just another<br/>
&gt; &gt;clone of every other class.<br/>
