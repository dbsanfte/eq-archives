<div id="ygrps-yiv-380646286">Ack in all truth this situation is not one of those between a rock and a<br/>
hard place situations.  Killing him does indeed make you faction with the<br/>
Freeport Militia bad and yes you can be KOS, but there is an easy way for<br/>
you to raise your faction with the people and militia of Freeport.  My<br/>
friend was KOS for killing him in hopes of completing the Paladin Quest,<br/>
he is not apprehensive.  I also know of Trolls that are amiable in the<br/>
city.  I included the spoiler at the end of this quoted block if you<br/>
really need to know.<br/>

&gt; Arrgh, rock and hard place.  The spoiler below may be vital to<br/>
&gt; any bard&#39;s ability to freely travel in Freeport.  If you<br/>
&gt; regularly group with paladins, I suggest you go ahead and read<br/>
&gt; it, as the spoiler is minor, but the grief it can save you is<br/>
&gt; immense.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok, so curiosity got the better of you I see 8)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here is the story- there is a guard that spawns<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the bank named Krazen Loosh. The people are<br/>
&gt; &gt; all camping there waiting for him to spawn so<br/>
&gt; &gt; they can kill him. Apparently, the other guards<br/>
&gt; &gt; do not assist him. There is a minor faction hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; associated with killing Krazen but I have seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; people camp for a week without becoming KOS. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Beware, this will make you KOS to the Freeport Militia.  They<br/>
&gt; are the guards in West and East Freeport.  The guards in North<br/>
&gt; Freeport are all paladins (except Krazen) which is why you do<br/>
&gt; not become KOS to them.  This is actually part of a bigger<br/>
&gt; plot, in which the paladins and the militia are both fighting<br/>
&gt; for control of Freeport.  Nearly anything that raises your<br/>
&gt; faction with the paladins lowers it with the militia, and vice<br/>
&gt; versa.<br/>
<br/>
Actually there is one way to raise your faction with the Freeport Militia<br/>
without harming you faction with the paladins.  If you go into the tunnels<br/>
beneath Freeport you will bump into a human standing beside a a dwarf.<br/>
When you talk to the dwarf he will mention how much he misses Kaladim.  To<br/>
alleviate his homesickness you give his human friend some dwarven ale and<br/>
bang you improve your faction with the Freeport Militia.  BTW if the<br/>
Freeport Militia hate you, the people of Freeport will hate you also.<br/>
Except in North Freeport since the Paladins run that area.<br/>
