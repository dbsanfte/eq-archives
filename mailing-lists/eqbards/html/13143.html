<div id="ygrps-yiv-74259159">When you camp the top of 4c, in order to get your pulls to come all the way to you, you have to stand on the steps in front of the door that drops you down to the sewers.  Do that, and ya won&#39;t have to worry about meeting them half way.<br/>

  This is kind of an interesting thing you brought up, regarding the check<br/>
  or flag when people are there. The other day I was camping the top of<br/>
  the temple and Archon with a L30 group (on my L30 character) and we&#39;d<br/>
  kill the spawns on the steps, mostly in melee, then when our puller<br/>
  would pull from lower in the temple, we found the lizards would get<br/>
  stuck on the corner by the stairs down. We found it annoying, but we&#39;d<br/>
  simply have 3-4 of us go to that corner and kill the lizard then run<br/>
  back. We did this for a few hours and made great exp.<br/>
<br/>
  A guide messaged our group leader and said &quot;thank you for not exploiting<br/>
  the faulty pathing in this area of the dungeon&quot;. It was actually kind of<br/>
  nice to have it mentioned, since we were a bit irritated at having to<br/>
  meet our pulls half-way. I know the temple&#39;s pathing has been bugged for<br/>
  ages, I guess I just wasn&#39;t aware anyone actually exploited it. Exploits<br/>
  don&#39;t seem like a very fun way to gain exp to me. I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
  someone petitioned us in the hopes of moving our group from the spot<br/>
  (seems unlikely, it was quite late and we had no visitors the entire<br/>
  time) or they have a check, but it very well could be.<br/>

  &gt;       I have heard that the GM&#39;s have somehow placed a monitor on the<br/>
  &gt; top of the<br/>
  &gt; temple. If someone up there casts a spell or attempts to camp out,<br/>
  &gt; this<br/>
  &gt; monitor thing reports it to a GM. I don&#39;t know if it will report<br/>
  &gt; simply<br/>
  &gt; being up there.<br/>
