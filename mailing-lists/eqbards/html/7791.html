&gt;&gt;Heh.  This is a great idea.  Next time you&#39;re doing a<br/>

&gt;&gt;put all your stuff in the bank (now that no-drops will go in),<br/>

&gt;Actually in the first few months of retail I used this to set up a VERY<br/>
&gt;profitable trade run between Kelethin and Qeynos :)  In Kelethin (or<br/>
&gt;Steamfont) I would buy all the Mino Axes I could get my hands on (for 4 to<br/>
