<br/>
I think GZ and Rokenn missed a pretty major point on the lullaby test.  I<br/>
think that all lull/mez type spells don&#39;t work in PvP.  Rokenn said that he<br/>
tested the song agains a level one human warrior.  The only way that I know<br/>
how to do this is via PvP.  To test the song with a real situation I would<br/>
go to a newbie area and test pixie strike against bats or something.<br/>
<br/>
Geez almost worried about the Berserker Cresendo answer.  I think that all<br/>
songs should have a bit more info after they are scribed.  Know what skill<br/>
the song uses and wether the song is instrument only would be nice.  And<br/>
remove the casting time info from bard songs.  Three seconds is what they<br/>
have always been.  Unless we get something that reduces bard casting time by<br/>
half I don&#39;t really see the need to remind us that a song takes 3 seconds to<br/>
cast.  Whoops kinda ranted like someone from EQ was actually listening<br/>
there.<br/>
