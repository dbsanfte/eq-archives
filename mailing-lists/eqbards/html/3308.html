<div id="ygrps-yiv-575745068">Astute observation John.  It has me wondering now, what is your agi then?<br/>
I still seem to be okay even with almost a full set of bronze (minus<br/>
gloves and mask).  However I haven&#39;t noticed being hit much more than I<br/>
did before, perhaps a higher AGI helps compensate for being really close<br/>
to your max weight allowance.  Just for reference my AGI is 100 base and<br/>
102 at the moment with the aid of an earring.  The other thing that I can<br/>
admit is the fact that I rarely dodge in combat.  So it appears that<br/>
encumberance plays a role with it.  I have 84 STR with all bonuses.  With<br/>
my armor, weapons and supplies I weigh in at 79.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ever since I moved to bronze plate (slowly switching it with<br/>
&gt; &gt;steel plate), I get the impression that mobs get an attack<br/>
&gt; &gt;bonus if you are close to encumbered but not there yet.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;regularly being hit for close to max damage, while my lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;level friends in banded seem to be taking less.  The only one<br/>
&gt; &gt;who seems to take more is my monk friend, who is 6 levels<br/>
&gt; &gt;behind me and has woven/mesh (leather/chain equivalent for<br/>
&gt; &gt;damage absorbtion).<br/>
&gt; ==========================<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; AH! Thank you John!! At least now I know it&#39;s not just MY imagination on<br/>
&gt; this one. I was thinking the same thing, but was kinda afraid to admit it,<br/>
&gt; fearing people would say I was just whining about something. I am usually,<br/>
&gt; because of loot, within 5 or so points of my weight allowance (but not<br/>
&gt; encumbered) and it seems like mobs NEVER miss me, ALWAYS do tremendous<br/>
&gt; damage, and I get stunned alot. The stunning part, as I HAVE &quot;whined&quot; about<br/>
&gt; in other messages, REALLY has been getting to me as of late since it seems<br/>
&gt; almost every other hit &quot;stuns&quot; me for some reason. I was actually beginning<br/>
&gt; to wonder if armor is worth anything, if I am going to be hit all the time<br/>
&gt; and stunned half the time ANYWAY. (smile)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe it is because we are so close to max weight. I will have to play with<br/>
&gt; that some, too.<br/>
