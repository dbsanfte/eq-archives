<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991014123"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; From: Perhaps a Princess... [mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sarah@...">sarah@...</a>]<br/>
&gt;&gt; (stealing all their copper that, in not very many levels, they&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt;&gt; tossing in piles on the ground anyway??? And that if they are<br/>
&gt;&gt; true newbies worrying about that!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;By &quot;true newbie&quot; I assume you mean non-twinks, since a non-twinked<br/>
&gt;secondary character will need to count their coppers as much as a primary<br/>
&gt;character at the lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, by &quot;True newbie&quot; I meant at levels 1-15 or so. About the point<br/>
when you start getting enough loot between trips back to town (And you&#39;re<br/>
far enough away from town) That you destroy coppers to save the weight and<br/>
keep you light on your feet.<br/>
<br/>
Twinked or not, ALL my characters save every copper they can get -- until<br/>
they run out of strength to carry it. And I haven&#39;t yet started throwing<br/>
silvers away. That still feels like a sacrilege.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Twinks, as a general rule, only group with other twinks.  I&#39;ve gotten a few<br/>
&gt;gifts (guard bracer, bracer of Erollisi, Dragoon Dirk, two earings of<br/>
&gt;desease reflection & a carnelian wedding band to be exact), but still don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;quite live up to the standards of twink groups.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a twink, I group with whoever I can find to group with. I don&#39;t look<br/>
at equipment. Shoot, I don&#39;t know whether most of it is &quot;good or bad&quot;<br/>
even. What I look at is first, personality. SOmeone I can get along<br/>
with. and second, level range. Can I group with them. Occasionally,<br/>
we&#39;ll be specifically looking for a tank-type, or a healer-type. Or<br/>
a Snarer. But that&#39;s about it :)<br/>
