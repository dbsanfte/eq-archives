<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677821092">Vox is a funny mob prepatch. First time we fought her right after patch we<br/>
nailed her she was pretty easy. After one of the server crashes the same<br/>
group of people went after her again and we got killed again she got a<br/>
Complete Heal off and then we were in trouble. Tried her again then ext<br/>
night same thing happened. Then just last night we went after naggy and took<br/>
him down quit quickly I bet it was no more then 5 minutes with only 2<br/>
deaths. Is it me or from a rping point of view does it seem that naggy<br/>
should be harder then vox?<br/>

&gt;this thread was so long it took me a week almost to start reading it.  i<br/>
&gt;knew this would come up if dragons were mentioned ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;we killed vox right after the most recent patch, and i will say my<br/>
&gt;experience is more like Rokenn than it is like Harm.  i died all the time<br/>

&gt;usually everyone in my group lives as well.  i can end up taking almost no<br/>

&gt;at the end of the fight or i can have 4 bubbs.  anyway the last time i<br/>
&gt;specifically thought of you, because after getting hit by the first breath<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; breath as over the weekend we did both Nag & Vox (other<br/>
&gt;&gt; guilds were sloted<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to do them but they could not take em and yield them to my<br/>
&gt;&gt; guild).  And in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; both runs I has taking as little as 1/8th a bubble from<br/>
&gt;&gt; dragon breaths.  My<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; FR/CR was 220+ in both cases.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;   I wasn&#39;t there, I can&#39;t say.  And I can&#39;t call you a liar.<br/>
&gt;&gt;   But it&#39;s my opinion that you are exaggerating quite a bit.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;   I&#39;ve been next to a dragon three times, CR 222, FR 170 and<br/>
&gt;&gt;   I took 400, yes four-hundred, points of dmg regardless.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;   And 1/8th of a bubble?  Rokken, come on man gimme a break.<br/>
&gt;&gt;   You cannot expect me to believe that. heh.  Your fish is getting<br/>
&gt;&gt;   a little too big.<br/>
