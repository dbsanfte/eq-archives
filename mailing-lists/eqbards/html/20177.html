<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876122377">Yep, I agree. There are diplomatic ways to direct people without having to <br/>
be a dictator about it. I&#39;m guilty of using far too many smilies in my <br/>
chatting in my attempts to keep from being overbearing as I direct people <br/>
while making them smile or laugh.<br/>
<br/>
My perspective is that if you want to direct people, do it in a way that <br/>
they will respect you and have fun at the same time since this is a game <br/>
and we&#39;re all looking to have fun. It&#39;s easy to go a little too far <br/>
directing people, but if they have a right attitude it can be fun. My <br/>
friend always throws in &quot;guarding you with my life master&quot; comments to me <br/>
as at times it does seem like it&#39;s me and my group of 6 pets. :-P One of <br/>
his characters is an enchanter, so he knows what I go through when I&#39;m <br/>
directing a group.<br/>

&gt;that if they didn&#39;t do exactly as specified and the enchanter died they were<br/>
&gt;leaving the group.  The one I usually group with isn&#39;t quite that bad, and<br/>
&gt;the one gnome was very friendly, but otherwise they seemed to have the<br/>

&gt;Given an enchanter&#39;s limited ac and hp, I don&#39;t think I blame them one bit<br/>
&gt;for being &quot;bossy&quot; in regards to mezzed mobs. *shrug*<br/>
