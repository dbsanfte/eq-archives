<div id="ygrps-yiv-173918345">Actually, here is my Black Helicopter(tm) Theory:<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere, somehow, sometime along the way (of development) agi, dex, str<br/>
got nerfed.  I think that it was Verant&#39;s original intention to make these<br/>
stats have an effect on player skills.  Else, why would they have them on<br/>
char building screens and give you the ability to allocate bonus points.<br/>
Also,  why would they have so many items with agi +3, dex +3, etc.  But in<br/>
the end, in the world of Norrath that we know, level is god, ac is king,<br/>
resists are you best friends and when your skills are maxed, agi, dex and<br/>
str are pretty meaningless beyond a decent base.<br/>
<br/>
So, given that, what good are songs that buff agi, dex and str?  The intent<br/>
is there but the execution is lacking.  If str actually did something - woo<br/>
hoo!  Chant and Anthem and Berzerker would be those awesome buffs you note<br/>
the lack of.<br/>

&gt; Okies, I&#39;ll go for it.  I&#39;ll use Verant&#39;s general idea of a bard as a<br/>
start<br/>
&gt; though, don&#39;t want to start that whole why the heck can we wear plate<br/>
&gt; argument again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Primary: Group buffs<br/>
&gt; Secondary: Melee<br/>
&gt; Tertiary: everything else<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why don&#39;t I think this is true currently?  Because Verant overvalues the<br/>
&gt; fact that our songs do not require mana.  To make it true would require<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; to realize their error.  We should be able to group buff a party at 5<br/>
levels<br/>
&gt; or so below what the other buffers can do to make it truly a primary<br/>
&gt; ability.  Currently many of our buffs are so far behind the equivalent<br/>
buffs<br/>
&gt; from other classes that unless the fighting is continuous it is better for<br/>
&gt; the other classes to buff up and med. </span></blockquote></div>
