<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Most of the info that would need to be in this guide has already been<br/>
&gt;written (or still in John Kim&#39;s head).  Pulling it out of the archives<br/>
&gt;though will be a pain. How we go about actually creating the guide can be<br/>
&gt;worked out later if enough people, especially the key posters on this list,<br/>
&gt;agree that its a good idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me know what you think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it would be a splendid idea! I know  I would surely appreciate non<br/>
bards knowing a bit more about how we can help them..and how they can best<br/>
benefit by our presence (GRIN)..and what spell songs CAN anf CANNOT<br/>
do..there are many myths which overrate and undercut our abilities..and many<br/>
nuances only a bard would understand...<br/>
