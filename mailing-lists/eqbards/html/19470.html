<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840583540">Again, speaking of interesting text: While we were in Hate one night, <br/>
occasionally we were getting some unusual messages like, &quot;you here a <br/>
stirring in the distance&quot; or &quot;you hear the wailing of the dead all around <br/>
you&quot;. Spooky stuff when you are medding between fights, with no mobs in <br/>
sight. =)  We are pretty sure it was a GM and it definitely was not a player <br/>
emote. Kinda made us uneasy.<br/>
<br/>
While we were at the chef/bartender area of Sebilis, FoH was conducting <br/>
their 3rd or 4th attempt (I forget) on Trakanon that night. After the last <br/>
man fell there was a text saying, &quot;You hear something feasting on the flesh <br/>
of the dead&quot; or something to that effect.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Was hunting Forest Giants in Warsliks Woods this weekend and ran into an<br/>
&gt; &gt;unusual one.  As you may know most of them are typed, for example Forest<br/>
&gt; &gt;Giant Evergreen, Forest Giant Greenwood, Forest Giant Sapling, etc.  This<br/>
&gt; &gt;one was A Forest Giant.  When he attacked in addition to the usual &quot;I <br/>
&gt;hate<br/>
&gt; &gt;Wood Elves&quot; there was some interesting text.<br/>
