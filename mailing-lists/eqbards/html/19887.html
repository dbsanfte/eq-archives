<br/>
why was it ok for the bard testers to take the boat back to the old world to<br/>
train but it wasn&#39;t ok for the Druids and the Paladins and the Rangers and<br/>
the Warriors and the Enchanters and the Magicians and the Wizards... ???<br/>
<br/>
What plethora of post 50 skills necessitated the trainers for them?<br/>

There is a Bard Song Vendor in Kunark.  There aren&#39;t any trainers because we<br/>
didn&#39;t get any skills after 50 (till 53).  Those skills that were thrown in<br/>
were an AFTER THOUGHT (emphasis mine) and the bards in the beta just went to<br/>
kelethin on the elven boat (or grabbed a gate/port) to train.</div>
