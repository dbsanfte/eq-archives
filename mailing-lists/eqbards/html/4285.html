Well J.M. Capozzi laid it to rest a while back.  Jig actually has no effect<br/>
on mana.<br/>
<br/>
Course, if you can indeed disprove him then I&#39;d be thinking J.M. Capozzi<br/>
wasn&#39;t really with Verant afterall.  I mean I can&#39;t confirm whether or not<br/>
J.M. is legit.  Is this just someone who just joined the list, and knew a<br/>
heck of a lot about the game and faked it?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I doubt that J.M. is a &quot;fake&quot; but wish you consider it, for<br/>
arguments sake.  I have no idea who J.M. is, and have no resource to confirm<br/>
it for that matter.  Must say, if J.M. were a fake, he or she would be a<br/>
very good fake.  But who are we, as the grunts, to know who makes the game<br/>
anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Credits tell us little, as does Verant&#39;s webpage.<br/>
<br/>
I like how Lionhead did it: they hired an actual journalist with games<br/>
experience to be part of their team.  You check their webpage, and you have<br/>
a writer from the inside giving you personal insights.  Get an idea how they<br/>
actually tick, and it&#39;s very interesting.  You also know who everybody is!<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea who makes EverQuest.<br/>
