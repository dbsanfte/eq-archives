&gt;I was talking to a fellow bard on Xegony last nite about the woes of the<br/>
&gt;mino and how the Dwarven Axe is better.  Any idea where this axe can be<br/>
&gt;obtained, or how much it usually runs price wise?  What are its stats?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recieved one from a quest originating in High Keep.  I sold it for 6 pp.<br/>
(I have no idea if this price was fair or not :)  The quest also returned 4<br/>
pp, netting me 10.  : )  If I remember correctly, the stats are 6 dam, 26<br/>
delay.  I tried doing the quest again, but was unsuccessful, so I don&#39;t know<br/>
if this is the normal return or if it&#39;s random.  I am going to attempt it<br/>
again.  If you&#39;re interested it&#39;s the Bounty Hunter Quest listed at EQLizer.<br/>
Now I don&#39;t have to give the spoiler, but if anyone wants it, they know<br/>
where to find it.  : )<br/>
