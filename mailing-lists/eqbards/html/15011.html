<b>Subject:</b> Gargoyle Island in OOT <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969465314">About a week ago there was a discussion about the gargoyles in OOT and<br/>
whether a level 22 Bard could solo them.  I expressed the opinion that it<br/>
would be unlikely based on my own experiences at level 23.  The thread also<br/>
discussed whether Selo&#39;s could be successfully used on the island.  I<br/>
expressed the opinion that it would cause too much damage because of the<br/>
rough terrain.  I was wrong on both counts.  Let me tell you how I found out<br/>
I was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I lost level 23 due to a bad pull by a spec hunting party on the island a<br/>
few nights ago.  I decided to try the gargoyles anyway since I was there.  I<br/>
found that I could take them using an all instrument attack provided they<br/>
didn&#39;t get too many resist on the DDD.  Even so the fight usually ended with<br/>
me having about a bubble of health left.  After killing two gargs I regained<br/>
level 23.  I then started to kill a 3rd and I had him down to about a third<br/>
health while I was about a bubble ahead of him, when a 2nd gargoyle joined<br/>
the fight.  In desperation I cranked up Selo&#39;s and ran.  I found that if I<br/>
paid careful attention and turned with the shoreline I took almost no<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
I twisted Selo&#39;s and Hymn until I was a little better than 1/2 health and<br/>
turned to kill the first garg then run again.  When I turned around the<br/>
first two had been joined by another two!  Whoo boy.  <br/>
<br/>
I was bound and determined I wasn&#39;t going to see level 22 again, so I<br/>
started Selo&#39;s back up and turned and ran.  I continued to twist Selo&#39;s and<br/>
Hymn until I was back to full health.  Then I gave a tell to a friend of<br/>
mine, a level 25 ranger, who happened to be in Freeport.  I asked if he<br/>
could give me a hand.  He said sure and headed for the boat.  In the<br/>
meantime I started using Bellow on the first garg.  I found that with Selo&#39;s<br/>
I was moving too fast to stay in range and let Selo&#39;s drop.  It turns out<br/>
that gargs fly at the same speed that we run, so I just kept up a normal run<br/>
and bellowed until garg number one bit the dust.  I then started in on garg<br/>
number two and he was almost dead when my friend arrived.  He snared garg<br/>
number three and meleed it while I finished off garg number two.  I then<br/>
turned and he and I dispatched garg number four.  My guildmate couldn&#39;t<br/>
believe I survived the incident.  I felt pretty good about it myself.<br/>
<br/>
So, my apologies for the misinformation that I expressed in the earlier<br/>
thread.<br/>
