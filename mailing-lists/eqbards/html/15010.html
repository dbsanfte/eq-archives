I was contacted for a corpse loc in Lake Rathe last Saturday and unable to <br/>
assist myself, I did /who all bard to see who was close. I found a young <br/>
bard named Atonal, L16 and just going to get the Ayre. He was a helpful <br/>
young man and so when the corpse recovery was called off due to the victim <br/>
getting rez&#39;ed by a wandering cleric, we struck up a friendship. Many <br/>
lambent stones were poofing as there were no bards in the Mtns responding to <br/>
our shouts so he came out and picked one up. Btw bards on Xegony, if /who <br/>
all Brilinnia is in Rathe mtns, good chance lambents stones are going to <br/>
waste, feel free to ask to come pick one up.<br/>
Next day Xegony tops 100 players in LG and Atonal is not busy, so I explain <br/>
to him where to come to wait to loot shin greaves and gaunts. Next thing I <br/>
know, some of my L50ish guildmates have slipped him into the assassin room <br/>
where there were camping for TBB&#39;s and masks not wanted. He never got a mask <br/>
since it didn&#39;t respawn but they tried for over 12 hrs.<br/>
I advised him to join this list too. I really enjoy helping out lower level <br/>
players with advice and probably will pass down some of my old equipment <br/>
like elfhides. I don&#39;t like the trend in beggars so I am in and out of bank <br/>
zones fast. But I don&#39;t like the image of &#39;high levels&#39; being aloof and too <br/>
busy to talk. I never go anony or RP, meaning I am willing to answer any <br/>
serious questions from anyone. Just ask me twice if I don&#39;t answer the first <br/>
time, spam being what it is in battle sometimes.<br/>
