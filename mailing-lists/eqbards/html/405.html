<div id="ygrps-yiv-459313388">Reminds me of a group that asked me to join once.  I was wandering around<br/>
the frigid north, new to the area, sort of bored, why not, eh?  There was<br/>
one fellow who knew what bards could do, he was the one I think who pressed<br/>
for my services (I could tell by the ooos and ahhs from the others when my<br/>
turbo drum overcharge kicked in).  After a few battles, he took me aside and<br/>
told me he should maybe &quot;explain&quot; to me how bards worked, &quot;The bard buffs<br/>
are worthless.&quot;  ???<br/>
<br/>
He just wanted two songs, and only two: accelerado and hymn of restoration,<br/>
&quot;the only worthwhile bard songs.&quot;  What I did?  I laughed in his face.<br/>
<br/>
Then I explained to him how MAGES should work: Stated I actually hated<br/>
waiting around for five minutes as he recharged after every skirmish with a<br/>
gnoll pup, so he shouldn&#39;t do anything at all--nada / zilch / stand there<br/>
stiff / do nothing--except in dire emergencies!  Told him a mage<br/>
should--never--cast spells (except for a pet), until that rare time the<br/>
battle is turning for the worse.  This will keep us alive, I explained, so<br/>
he will have full mana available if we get jumped or overwhelmed.  First,<br/>
we&#39;ll move from monster to monster quicker for better experience, second, we<br/>
avoid sitting around in dangerous areas, third, when things go bad he&#39;ll<br/>
have maximum firepower.  That shut him up.<br/>
<br/>
Like he&#39;s about to follow us around doing absolutely nothing during most<br/>
battles, even if it insured the survival of the group!  Needless to say, the<br/>
&quot;buff&quot; songs continued!  And the Hymn was played at the proper time!  And<br/>
I&#39;m sure he cast his spells at the proper time, actually, for I only<br/>
pretended to know how to do his job, but in retrospect it does make a lot of<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
Keep this in mind: it&#39;s your character, not the leader&#39;s.  Personally, if I<br/>
find myself in a group with a bad &quot;general,&quot; I either disobey (and see how<br/>
he reacts) and/or leave.  You can be arrogant, see,  because you are a BARD,<br/>
special, who needs the rest of them, eh?  Any other group would happily grab<br/>
me up!  Ever hear a bard shout to &quot;join a group&quot; more than Once?  Hah!<br/>
Never believe anybody knows more about being a bard than you do, because<br/>
they may have played a bard but not--Your--bard!  And you&#39;re in demand,<br/>
don&#39;t take no nonsense, you can be choosey!  Any group that can&#39;t use a bard<br/>
has never been with a bard.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And besides, you&#39;re really singing the songs about the glory of your group,<br/>
who wants to sing songs of glory to a bunch of nimrods?  Flit around &#39;til<br/>
you find real heroes like a real bard.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Your concerns really struck a nerve with me and I&#39;d like to share some of<br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;&gt; observations about life as a bard.  As mentioned in  previous reply, we<br/>
&gt;&gt; bards are actually very good soloists.  When things get hairy, we have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In the situation you<br/>
&gt;&gt; described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot, I&#39;d hit accellerando<br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I lasted about 15 seconds.  I tried my damndest to get accell - but kept on<br/>
&gt;getting stunned...<br/>
&gt;While I was stunned the two cents and the legionaire were hitting me..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; about 3 bars of health.  This is because you slow down below 2 bars and<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt; may need that extra bar to get some distance between you and the orcs.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Always have accellerando hot-keyed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Stupid me - didn&#39;t know you can hot-key a spell...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Second, lament is a great spell but it can, as you have learned, fail.<br/>
&gt;&gt; However, the lower the level of creature is compared to you, the more<br/>
&gt;likely<br/>
&gt;&gt; it is to succeed.  Never use it on a white or higher con.  It will fail<br/>
&gt;way<br/>
&gt;&gt; too often.  But, if they all con green or a low blue, you could solo a<br/>
&gt;camp<br/>
&gt;&gt; and clean it out.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t realize they &quot;fixed&quot; that spell.  When I first got it - it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;working.  Was soloing an orc camp in Lesser Feydark - (with a bunch of high<br/>
&gt;level guys - no prob that time) - and it didn&#39;t work.  I recall comments on<br/>
&gt;this list about it.  If there were comments that it was fixed - I must have<br/>
&gt;missed it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Third, our greatest power is in grouping, but grouping is risky.  It is a<br/>
&gt;&gt; high-trust situation.  Be very careful who you group with and guage how<br/>
&gt;well<br/>
&gt;&gt; you can trust them.  I might group with a group like you had described,<br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt;&gt; I would not trust them to save my butt if I got in trouble and at the<br/>
&gt;first<br/>
&gt;&gt; sign of trouble, I&#39;d run.  Only when they have shown that they can be<br/>
&gt;&gt; counted on to keep me alive when the going got rough would I let myself<br/>
&gt;get<br/>
&gt;&gt; low in health.  I die more frequently in a group then solo because I am<br/>
&gt;&gt; still too trusting and eager to jump into danger to save someone whose<br/>
&gt;&gt; stupidity got them into trouble... usually failing and dieing along side<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well the biggest thing I learned - not to listen to non-bards about what<br/>
&gt;song to use.  The leader of the group (who seemed to know what he was<br/>
&gt;doing) - asked me to turn on the dischord song before starting to fight.  I<br/>
&gt;should have trusted my own instincts than listen to someone else...  I<br/>
&gt;usually start with a buff song - and switch when I feel it&#39;s appropriate.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Be up front with them about this though.  Make sure they understand that<br/>
&gt;&gt; since you don&#39;t know them well, and your life is dear to you, you will do<br/>
&gt;&gt; what you have to to protect it until some trust and teamwork has<br/>
&gt;developed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I appreciate the advice.  Live and learn (or in this case - Die and Learn!)<br/>
&gt;Getting Stunned is clearly the biggest problem we face in combat!<br/>
