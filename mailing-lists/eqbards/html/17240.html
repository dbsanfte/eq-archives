<div id="ygrps-yiv-468115068">Okay, I know that the theory says that 3 songs should be optimized, but I<br/>
have been weaving 4 when soloing out of a vague feeling that the total<br/>
effect was most beneficial (at level 24-26 it&#39;s been DDD, CoD, Chains,<br/>
Hymn). With the new DoT messages it appears that I can keep everything going<br/>
and the DoTs wear off as I am starting the new DoT. (I play on a P2 266 and<br/>
56K modem and this is still no problem most places). Am I missing something<br/>
still?<br/>
<br/>
Also, as I am sure people have found out, when grouping the group leader<br/>
gets my DoT messages *laughs* probably not as intended...<br/>
