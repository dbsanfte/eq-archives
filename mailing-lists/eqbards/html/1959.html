I just had the most righteous day of adventuring.  Using my newly acquired Kelin&#39;s I gained over half a level towards 11 in just under 3 hours!!!<br/>
This may seem small to some but when I remember that it took me 2 weeks to get from 7 to 8 it makes me jump for joy.  We camped derv&#39;s and orcs all day in E. and W. Commons.  Rather exciting!!!  Anyway just letting my joy sound out!  <br/>
<br/>
Keep up the helpful posting here bards.  It is a true godsend.<br/>

P.S.  Where is a good loot grabbing spot for lvl&#39;s 10 and 11.  These songs are getting expensive and its getting to be time for an armor upgrade.<br/>
Seems like the loot was dry today.  Even at the derv camp.</div>
