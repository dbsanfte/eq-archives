year and a half ago.  I thought Verant would&#39;ve picked up on<br/>
that from the beginning.  Why does *every* server have to be<br/>
down for the entire day when they screw up a major patch?  Oh<br/>
yeah, their login server can&#39;t handle the load if a single<br/>
server is down and will prevent people on other servers from<br/>
logging in, so the point is moot...<br/>
<br/>
Still, the smart thing to do with *all* patches is to go from<br/>
test server -&gt; one live server -&gt; all live servers.<br/>
