<div id="ygrps-yiv-76268060">I think Robynn was referring to the &#39;good&#39; aligned Terial Dal that were in W<br/>
commons.  Apparently there are good aligned dark elves out there somewhere.<br/>
Not sure what level they were as I missed the event entirely.  I was in<br/>
Kithicor when I logged out Friday nite and could not log in with that people<br/>
in the zone apparently.<br/>
A friend of mine said the Terial Dal were KoS&#39;ing evil races on sight (he&#39;s<br/>
an inky) at very long range.  If these new mobs are going to be permanent<br/>
residents of Kithicor, getting those ranger quests is going to be tough.<br/>

&gt; Well, E&#39;ci&#39;s version of the event got screwed up by some greedy high<br/>
&gt; leevls.  Most all of the good NPC&#39;s were killed and I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; anyone got rewarded except for those who got to loot the undead and<br/>
&gt; dark elves (read greedy high level bastards).  The high levels weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; all bad, though, some would leave the loot if they couldn&#39;t use it and<br/>
&gt; broadcast to the zone where it was...so some greedy high level<br/>
&gt; (who probably couldn&#39;t use it) would come and pick it up.  Bitter?<br/>
&gt; Nah.  Actually I only died once in the whole thing, when I was blinded<br/>
&gt; by Innoruk&#39;s hate.<br/>
<br/>
The Tier&#39;dal Seargents were blue to me at level 40.  The<br/>
Tier&#39;dal Lieutenants were red to me, yellow to a L45 friend.  <br/>
The named NPCs were red to the L45 friend.  If the high level<br/>
people hadn&#39;t killed all the &quot;good&quot; NPCs (I assume you mean<br/>
good-potential-loot NPCs), the low level people probably<br/>
would&#39;ve died a lot more.  Of course my server (Karana)<br/>
crashed before the culmination of the event (210 people in<br/>
Kithicor will do that).<br/>
<br/>
My friends who stuck around afterwards and played a bit in the<br/>
&quot;new&quot; Kithicor say most of the mobs there were blue-yellow at<br/>
level 40.  Seems Verant is trying to give the L40-50 folks<br/>
more areas to play in.<br/>
<br/>
What *was* amusing was a lot of the high level folks had the<br/>
&quot;it&#39;s blue, kill it&quot; attitude so ingrained that they ended up<br/>
killing NPCs that were on our side.  Hope they enjoy the<br/>
faction loss.<br/>
