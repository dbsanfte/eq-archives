Since on my server (Karana) the Treehouse is majorly camped, but there are <br/>
many wandering Avaiks in the area between the Treehouse and Paw.  When I <br/>
used to slow there I would just zoom around with Selo&#39;s till I found one.  <br/>
This was still quicker (and more fun) then fighting over the static spawn at <br/>
the Treehouse :)<br/>

&gt;Myself and another bard on my server, seem to be doing well in South Karana<br/>
&gt;fighting Aviaks in and around the Aviak City... We can solo Darters and<br/>
&gt;Rooks, and in groups we can take harriers and Avocets, these things are <br/>
&gt;rich<br/>
&gt;also.  I went from just hitting 21 to well into 23 so far in a couple of<br/>
&gt;days.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I can sympathize with you because I am finding myself in the same<br/>
&gt;situation.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Since I made 22d level a few weeks back, I have died more times since <br/>
&gt;then<br/>
&gt; &gt;than I did from 18-22 combined (at least it seems that way).  I made 23d<br/>
&gt; &gt;level a week ago. Since then, I have died and gone back to 22d level <br/>
&gt;three<br/>
&gt; &gt;times. Finally made it back to 23d yesterday but my progress towards 24th<br/>
&gt; &gt;level is going extremely slow.  Its like taking two steps backward for<br/>
&gt;every<br/>
&gt; &gt;one step forward.  My tactics, gained from reading this list, haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;changed so it has to be something else.  A couple of times my death has<br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt; &gt;due to being in a bad group.  One time it was strictly my fault.  I made<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;mistake of playing Denon&#39;s in the basement of HighKeep.  I wasn&#39;t getting<br/>
&gt; &gt;any messages that people were casting so I didn&#39;t think the z-axis bug<br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt;affect me.  That was a bad assumption and I got killed by the guards.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m beginning to think soloing may be good for me for the time being.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Someone mentioned soloing the aviaks in Rathe Mountains as an option.  <br/>
&gt;Does<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone have any other recommendations?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions about where to go to earn solo<br/>
&gt;experience<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; at my level (24)?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Does anyone have any tactical suggestions to permit me to keep my butt<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; alive when grouped with mediocre<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; players?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I hate playing for eight hours and earning only one bubble of <br/>
&gt;experience.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Or less.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
