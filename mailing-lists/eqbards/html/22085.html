<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754093175">Well, I am almost ready for some plane hunting myself, and should be going<br/>
up in early November.  I have seen various bards comment about not singing<br/>
during pulls etc. while in the planes, but what I would really like is a<br/>
synopis of &quot;bard tactics&quot; while in Fear, Hate and Sky.<br/>
<br/>
A few of you guys up for the task?  Anyone...Anyone.....<br/>
