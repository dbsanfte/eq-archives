&gt; If it makes you feel better, we killed a named Cyc on gornit&#39;s island this<br/>
&gt; weekend, took us about an hour and a half to kill him and all we got was a<br/>
&gt; Pearl necklace, and one died doing it.   He kept draining mana on all the<br/>
&gt; casters, very unhealthy...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone know what the necklace is?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a cyclops in OOT you must kill for an item (don&#39;t remember what)<br/>
for the new Jboots quest.  If its the ring of the ancients, you have that<br/>
quest item. If its anything else I&#39;m a clueless bard!<br/>
