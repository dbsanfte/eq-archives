<br/>
&gt;an attitude, and I&#39;m seriously considering making a Bard on the PVP server.<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s many there... at least I&#39;d not die too much, because<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d flee like speedy gonzalez if I was losing the fight, but it&#39;d also be<br/>
&gt;interesting to see how Bards stack up against the folks in there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a friend from my old UO days, met him in the early times when I was<br/>
always alone in Hythloth, a bard wearing no armor (because of 15 strength of<br/>
course, screwy game made bards weaklings), but slaying countless daemons.<br/>
This fellow became like the apprentice bard, and would watch and assist me.<br/>
Later he joined up with a guild of murderers there, and now plays on PvP<br/>
here, and is a very high level bard!<br/>
<br/>
He told me that in PvP, the bard quite simply rules, and he wouldn&#39;t play<br/>
another character.<br/>
