<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568052111">i felt exactly the same as you.  i thought the same thing at that dragon<br/>
raid and all other types of loot before, but after many more dragons and<br/>
gods i have come to accept the system as extremely fair.  if you think about<br/>
it, a runed bolster belt is all/all.  you don&#39;t want robes in the lotto for<br/>
that.  and the ykesha is quite a different type of loot than what comes off<br/>
dragons/gods.  much more common and easy to get, so in a different category.<br/>
these rules only apply to dragon and god loot.  here is the link to my<br/>
guild&#39;s web page.  click on the link at the top that says DKPs.  see what<br/>
you think.  it&#39;s an interesting read at our lotto system:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Isn&#39;t this a bit of a double standard? I assume people were upset<br/>
&gt; because a ranger is better at melee and thus theoretically could have<br/>
&gt; made use of the mistwalker more than a druid, yet the staff (forbidden<br/>
&gt; rites I assume) is also a pretty kick butt melee weapon and just as<br/>
&gt; useless in the hands of a cleric as the mistwalker would be <br/>
&gt; in the hands<br/>
&gt; of a druid.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is also the same kind of attitude that was used to keep Bards out<br/>
&gt; of the early lottos for Ykeshas on my server and it still <br/>
&gt; pisses me off. </span></blockquote></div>
