<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613492100">No the exploit in OT near SF is definitly where the mob crashes into  the<br/>
corner of the SF entrance and just keeps running in place.  What you<br/>
described is just getting to know the pathing of mobs in the area.  I do<br/>
that in every zone I fear/snare in.</div>
