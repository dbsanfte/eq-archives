&gt; &gt; Since you apparently are a person who has been PK&#39;d, I have some questions<br/>
&gt; &gt; about how PK works.  Not that I would ever play that way, I hated UO for<br/>
&gt; &gt; that one reason.  It&#39;s bad enough we got insta kill monsters, having to<br/>
&gt; &gt; worry about them, and other players attacking make it way to complicated for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyways, if you PK someone, how much can you loot?  Everything?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Percentages, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; also in a duel, if you win, what are you allowed to loot off the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; player?  Items?  Money?  Nothing?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; the rules for a pk are the same as looting rules for a duel ,,<br/>
&gt; you are able to loot anything that is equipped ,, or in an open inventory<br/>
&gt; slot ,,, plus all the money on the corpse ,,,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This requires a little clarification, just so everyone doesn&#39;t get totally<br/>
scared<br/>
away from even trying Zek. :)  You can loot any *one* item a person has on<br/>
them, not including containers or anything stored in containers, plus you can<br/>
loot all the money.  However, *anyone* can loot you for a few seconds after<br/>
a player kills you - whenever I&#39;m getting attacked by a mage much higher than<br/>
me with no chance of escape, I tell my friends to stand right by me and loot me<br/>
the second I die - That way, the killer gets nothing, I lose nothing.<br/>
