<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354521449">Just to add my 2 coppers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been mudding since Diku&#39;s first came to the states, so I&#39;ve seen muds<br/>
grow up for quite a while.  Twinking has always existed and always will.<br/>
For the most part most people dislike it because, like you say, jealousy.<br/>
But, there&#39;s also some very detrimental effects to twinking.<br/>
<br/>
1) Lazy players - Although it might seem &#39;nice&#39; to give that barbed leather<br/>
whip you just upgraded, to a lower level character, this slowly tends to<br/>
breed a dependance & you&#39;ll start to see an increase of item/cash beggers.<br/>
You also see this occur ALOT with information, slowly as people&#39;s questions<br/>
are answered with shouts, they tend to become less & less likely to explore<br/>
and learn for themselves.  Soon you have a spam-load of questions going back<br/>
& forth & lots of people shouting RTFM.  The preferable method I&#39;ve found<br/>
for items to newbies, is more to play secret santa... Upgraded that whip &<br/>
don&#39;t feel like dealing with the hassle of selling it?  Go give it to a<br/>
beetle in the commons, then invis & watch the glee of the newbie who finds<br/>
it.  The difference here is that they assume the game is giving them an<br/>
ultra rare (which is should do IMHO) instead of a player giving them<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
2) Respect for the game - This one&#39;s VERY hard to put a finger on, but with<br/>
most muds there&#39;s a definite learning curve that one must follow to succeed<br/>
in the game.  By twinking a character you sufficiently flatten out that<br/>
curve & as a result new characters will circumvent the &quot;babtism by fire&quot;<br/>
that seasoned players had to go through.  An often forgotten about portion<br/>
of the game, is that whole character building process that you have to go<br/>
through.  Again, in general, what I&#39;ve seen is people who are twinked tend<br/>
to not &#39;love&#39; & respect the game like those of us that have gone down that<br/>
hard path, they&#39;re usually more likely to exploit bugs, and not give a rat&#39;s<br/>
arse about the &#39;big picture&#39; of the game.  Unfortunately, The only way for<br/>
people to learn this love/respect of the game is to go through it<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Token Disclaimer:<br/>
These are pretty extreme overall generalities, please don&#39;t infer that I&#39;m<br/>
calling you the anti-christ of eq for giving that whip to your buddy because<br/>
you want to give him a leg up.  In addition there&#39;s an extreme difference<br/>
between twinking a newbie who hasn&#39;t learned the game yet, and twinking a<br/>
secondary character who&#39;s already learned that respect for the game I<br/>
mentioned.  (Level 1-10 for almost all characters is ABOUT the same, but<br/>
then again most people who have played the game alot can burn through the<br/>
1st ten levels in under 2 days /played, untwinked)<br/>

&gt;Sorry, I just had to reply to this, and then I&#39;ll let the subject drop<br/>
&gt;forever. Enough has been said about twinking. I have to say, you have to be<br/>
&gt;a real jerk to give somebody flak because they are twinked. This is called<br/>
&gt;JEALOUSY folks. Get over it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;IMHO someone totally ruined the game for this guy, and he will never even<br/>
&gt;&gt;know it.  Not only has the thrill of the loot been taken from him, among<br/>
&gt;&gt;other things,  *but other players will make his life a hard one because he<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;&gt;twinked.*<br/>
