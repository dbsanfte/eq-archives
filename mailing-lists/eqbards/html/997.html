&gt; 1.  Thanks for all the feedback on the Lull song.  Tried it last night <br/>
&gt; and it worked great.  I&#39;m lazy and hate doing the instrument/weapon <br/>
&gt; swap (Unless I&#39;m running that is... a giant can be very motivating :))<br/>
&gt; so after I killed one goblin I just renewed the song on the other two <br/>
&gt; etc. repeat.  It&#39;s a fast spell so this is easy. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The spellcasters who have the lull spell will also love you<br/>
for it because it frees them up from having to &quot;waste&quot; mana<br/>
immediately before a battle, and from taking up a potential<br/>
&quot;combat&quot; spell slot with a &quot;non-combat&quot; spell.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  I have heard that Wisps can drop great loot (lightstones) but you <br/>
&gt; need a magic weapon.  What is the easiest/cheapest magic slashing 1h  <br/>
&gt; weapon that I can lay my hands on? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Easiest is probably buying a combine weapon from any of the<br/>
gypsy camps.  A combine longsword will cost a bard between<br/>
52.5 to 60 pp with 6/28 stats.  A combine scimitar is 5/24<br/>
(significantly worse) and only 39.9-45pp, and the aftermarket<br/>
is slightly bigger since druids can use it.  A combine short<br/>
sword is around 36.7-42pp at 4/23 (much worse).  If you&#39;ve<br/>
been practicing your piercing skill and want the absolte<br/>
cheapest, the combine dagger is 3/19 at 31.5-36pp.  (Upper<br/>
prices are my estimates, lower prices are what I&#39;m charged<br/>
with 110 charisma.)  You may be able to get a better price<br/>
from a player getting rid of his combine weapon.  You could<br/>
also have a shaman or enchanter cast a spell to enhance your<br/>
charisma to get a better price (which as someone else noted<br/>
becomes well worth it in this price range).<br/>
<br/>
Cheapest is if you can find a player selling a magic weapon.  <br/>
I hear tentacle whips go for about 20-25pp, but their lifetap<br/>
effect screws up bard songs.  Most everything else is around<br/>
the price of an equivalent combine weapon or higher.<br/>
Crookstinger is a magical piercing weapon which is found on<br/>
the king (queen?) giant wasp in lesser faydark and supposedly<br/>
only L10 or so, but I have yet to hear of anyone seeing this<br/>
mob much less getting this item.<br/>
<br/>
Monks can use netted/woven/mesh gloves to make their punches<br/>
magical.  But I&#39;m hearing conflicting reports as to whether or<br/>
not it makes the punches of non-monks magical.  Netted gloves<br/>
can often be bought for 5gp - 3pp.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.  Throwing weapons....  I have been thinking about trying these for <br/>
&gt; some time.  (Poor mans fetch spell)  Can you ever recover the dagger <br/>
&gt; after you use it or is it lost for good?  Seems expensive if you have <br/>
&gt; to replace them every time. (1s+ each)  Do they attract the mob even <br/>
&gt; if you miss?  (funny image of dagger flying past the nose of Mooto the <br/>
&gt; Goblin followed by a yawn.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You cannot recover them.  The cost is trivial at higher<br/>
levels.  At L16, I typically brought in 5-20pp in a night&#39;s<br/>
play, and rarely used more than 20 shurikens (2+ gp).  I think<br/>
I spend more on food and water (which is kinda hard to forage<br/>
in the desert).<br/>
<br/>
They attract the mob if you miss, but not if your shot is<br/>
blocked (by a person, tree, hill, whatever).  They are also<br/>
useful when you and someone else see a mob at the same time<br/>
and race to see who can engage it first to claim it. :-)<br/>
