<div id="ygrps-yiv-478012551">At around level 28 or so we just started doing &quot;just loot every once in a<br/>
while&quot; and doing the &#39;/rand 1 100&#39; for the highest number on any rare items.<br/>
Seems to work fine, although every once in a while you will group with<br/>
someone that is extremely greedy.<br/>

&gt; I would have to say that the looting thing becomes less and less<br/>
&gt; of a hassle<br/>
&gt; the further you progress in levels.  Above 20, most people are in<br/>
&gt; guilds and<br/>
&gt; are fairly likely to be with at least one other guild member in a party<br/>
&gt; which tends to make people a little less greedy with loots - or<br/>
&gt; so I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; so far.  I have a very small guild (14 people - all levels 20-35) and yet<br/>
&gt; somehow we always end up having at least 3 of us in a party (most of the<br/>
&gt; time its 5 or 6).  We tend to do the master loot and split<br/>
&gt; method.  We have<br/>
&gt; one person, usually a warrior type loot all the corpses.  If people are<br/>
&gt; looking to keep items like FS and the like, we do that<br/>
&gt; alphabetically.  The<br/>
&gt; coin however, we split whenever a party member is leaving or<br/>
&gt; right before a<br/>
&gt; new member joins so that nobody misses out on what they&#39;ve earned.  If<br/>
&gt; something rare comes up we find out who wants it and do the random roll<br/>
&gt; thing.   Almost everyone outside of the guild that we&#39;ve ever grouped with<br/>
&gt; has agreed that this is a much more efficient way of looting, as it keeps<br/>
&gt; away from the hard feelings of FFA, the bugs that incur during auto split<br/>
&gt; (i.e. looter gets 2pp, member 2 gets 2gp, member 3 gets 2sp,<br/>
&gt; etc.), and the<br/>
&gt; added burden to weak party members (like myself).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, just my little bit of input<br/>
