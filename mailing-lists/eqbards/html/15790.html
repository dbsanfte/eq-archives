<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards]  Harmonic reappearance?!? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-620897842">Harmonic,<br/>
    I know you&#39;ve decided to take some time off from EQ, but the strangest thing happened to me last night.  I was in High Keep, killing warriors while my name cycled through the raider list (yawn), when low and behold a bard came through the door by the name of -- you guessed it Harmonic Distortion!!  I asked him &quot;Harmonic? On this server?&quot;  He said yep!  Hmmmm.....<br/>
    Anyway, if you still lurk, tell me the inside scoop.  Have you restarted on Erollisi Marr?  Or has Harmonic groupie-dom spread across servers now?  Please advise as I was quite taken by surprise.<br/>
