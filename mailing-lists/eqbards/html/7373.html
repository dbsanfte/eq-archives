&gt;- You need to have your pet targeted to recharm it, so you can&#39;t really<br/>
&gt;help your group or your pet by fighting another mob.  (You can, but<br/>
&gt;switching targets can get tricky.)  So just keep your pet targeted, and<br/>
&gt;equip an instrument to concentrate on buffing/healing your party instead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great song analysis on charm John.  The happy day that I can use this song<br/>
is still 3 levels away.  Your analysis answered all my questions and opened<br/>
my eyes in some areas previously unconsidered.   Sorry for responding a<br/>
little bit behind the &#39;times&#39; but I thought this little tidbit was worth<br/>
throwing out.<br/>
<br/>
Verant added in the last month or two, the Double F1 targetting option.<br/>
Basically, press F1, you will now be targetted on yourself, press F1 a<br/>
second time, and your pet is now targetted.  This is from an old<br/>
necromancer&#39;s point of view, but it does work with summoned skeletons, as<br/>
well as &lt;grins wickedly&gt; charmed undead (A spectre says, &quot;As you wish<br/>
Master&quot;).  I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to try charming as a bard, but I&#39;m<br/>
assuming it will work.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that you are better off charming and singing party buff songs, than<br/>
trying to jump into melee another pulled NPC.  Your pet is going to be able<br/>
to dish out much more damage than a bard, and I imagine it would be very<br/>
easy to lose control of your pet when you are trying to recharm and &lt;You are<br/>
stunned&gt; graces your display.<br/>
