<div id="ygrps-yiv-404528595">Well first of all, I don&#39;t want to point fingers or anything either but have<br/>
you tried to kill these velious mobs?  Sure FoH and AL (that sploiting<br/>
Shada!) have found ways to kill these mobs with less people, but I would<br/>
have to say the majority of guilds have not.  <br/>
<br/>
Believe me the challenge is NOT gone when it still takes a guild of 50<br/>
people with many Donals&#39; 6 hours to kill two dragons.  Its not as &quot;heat and<br/>
stir&quot; as you seem to think.  Can&#39;t even begin to tell you the hours we&#39;ve<br/>
spent haha.  It takes a cleric 30 seconds to cast his bp - its not like its<br/>
instantaneous. <br/>
<br/>
Yes I believe I said I DID read the whole post.  I know they will plan to<br/>
downlevel the mobs.  I just hope they actually do it.  It has nothing to do<br/>
with loot but everything to do with conquoring challenges.  I just like the<br/>
challenges to be fair.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, maybe Paradigm sucks and we have no strategy, dunno.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The nerf on the Donal&#39;s makes perfect sense to me.  It is too <br/>
&gt; powerful an<br/>
&gt; item.  They have also mentioned that were going to look at <br/>
&gt; tuning down those<br/>
&gt; high velious mobs that require the BP.  I wish people would <br/>
&gt; read the ENTIRE<br/>
&gt; post and not just the parts that upset them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see why everyone is so mad about this change.  They <br/>
&gt; put in an item<br/>
&gt; that ended up being more powerful then they expected, so they <br/>
&gt; are tuning it<br/>
&gt; down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kinda takes the challenge out of the mob doesn&#39;t it?  Get a <br/>
&gt; cleric in your<br/>
&gt; group with the BP and one warrior can take any, and I mean <br/>
&gt; ANY mob that does<br/>
&gt; not outright kill  the warrior in 30 seconds.  As longs as <br/>
&gt; your cleric can<br/>
&gt; click fast enough.  Kinda ruins the game.  There is more to <br/>
&gt; this game that<br/>
&gt; the ph4t l33t.  Otherwise it would be dead now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Plus, the way they were talking about nerfing it, still makes <br/>
&gt; it a powerful<br/>
&gt; item.  The cleric could still completly heal the party in 3 <br/>
&gt; minutes (no<br/>
&gt; change here from the original BP), after that the first person has 4.5<br/>
&gt; minutes (or whatever they set as the buff time) before they <br/>
&gt; can have the BP<br/>
&gt; used on them, again.  Not bad, in my opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, flame all you want.  I don&#39;t care, I support the <br/>
&gt; change.  It&#39;s good<br/>
&gt; for the game as a whole.<br/>
