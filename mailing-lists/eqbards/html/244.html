<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700625874">Yeah the bards have to travel more than any other class. Its pretty fun<br/>
too. You really get to see the world. Try traveling even more, its fun<br/>
to see the reactions of players when you tell them in halas that you&#39;ve<br/>
come from kelethin, and even more when you tell the people in oggk or<br/>
grobb(well outta the guards&#39; views atleast) where you&#39;ve come from. The<br/>
bards are supposed to travel, and IMO any class should see the world.<br/>
You might not level as fast, but saying that you&#39;ve visited every city<br/>
by level 10 or so can turn quite a few heads. ;)<br/>

&gt; I had JUST made level 8 - and at first was pretty annoyed at not having easy<br/>
&gt; access to the song.  I found a high level bard to lead me to Kelethin and<br/>
&gt; the bard&#39;s guild (he needed the 11th spell).  The trip was long and boring -<br/>
&gt; but it gave me an opportunity to practice my lute playing...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After getting the Bard&#39;s guild in Kelethin - confirmed I didn&#39;t have enough<br/>
&gt; cash to buy it (which I expected) - so I figure what the hell - I&#39;ll try to<br/>
&gt; meet some people and operate out of the area.  I had a great time - met new<br/>
&gt; people, saw new sights, and killed new critters.  The Steamfont Mountains<br/>
&gt; are particularly cool.  The windmills are particularly impressive (ooc -<br/>
&gt; makes me want to go back and visit Holland again).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it wasn&#39;t for that - I&#39;d probably still be operating out of E Commons and<br/>
&gt; N. Ro - and not &quot;see the world&quot;.   OOC - I think it&#39;s a smart design feature<br/>
&gt; by the makers - as it forces you to play the bard - roaming the world,<br/>
&gt; seeing the sights meeting new people...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The more I play this game - the more I like it - and the less I liked my UOL<br/>
&gt; experience.  I like the social interaction of online - and I really NEVER<br/>
&gt; met anyone in UOL - too worried about getting jumped and your stuff stolen.<br/>
&gt; And (at least while I was online) the buddy list thingy never worked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A lot of people complain about the quirks of the Name filter - but I<br/>
&gt; ultimately like it.  I got bit - It rejected &quot;Slide&quot; which I&#39;ve played on<br/>
&gt; many an online (and solo) game - but big deal - in this land the spelling is<br/>
&gt; different and hence &quot;Slyde&quot;.  I&#39;ll gladly give that up to never see<br/>
&gt; &quot;k3W1d00dZ&quot;!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I believe that the bards in the back room of the guild hall sell a<br/>
&gt; &gt; smattering of songs. I know that the 8th level song, Lament, is only<br/>
&gt; &gt; available in Kelethin as is 11 and 13 I think. A few higher level songs<br/>
&gt; seem<br/>
&gt; &gt; available at all bard guilds but most of them will be hidden in other<br/>
&gt; remote<br/>
&gt; &gt; places.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sure, tehre are some lists around on the internet listing the locations of<br/>
&gt; &gt; most of the songs but I think it is more fun to ask fellow bards in-game<br/>
&gt; &gt; where they might be.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good Journey,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I am new to this list and have read two digests so far. I just reached<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8th level a few days ago and was curious about a few things.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My bardess resides in Kelethin and the guild there only sells songs up to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; 7th level song. I am curious as to where I would obtain the rest of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not sure where to start looking for them or if they are quests. The guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; leader<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Kelethin only gives out drums for four spiderling silks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like for the information either on the list or emailed to me<br/>
&gt; &gt; directly<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kristin- Wood elf of Kelethin<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8th level Bardess<br/>
