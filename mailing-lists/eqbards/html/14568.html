&gt; OK speaking from experience here.  Our underwater breathing (UB) song does<br/>
&gt; not override Enduring Breath (EB).  If EB is up and you start singing UB, EB<br/>
&gt; will still be up when you stop singing.  However, if you are singing UB and<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t have EB, EB will not stick if someone tries to cast it on you.<br/>
&gt; You have to stop UB first in order to get EB to stick.  While in Kedge, I<br/>
&gt; always have UB memmed.  Whenever someone announces EB is dropping, I get UB<br/>
&gt; ready in case they start drowning.  Saved a 50 paladin the other night<br/>
&gt; because of it.  To say the least he was glad I had it ready.<br/>

&gt; Note to Laluni:  I&#39;ll be in Kedge tonight around 9PM PST if I can get a ride<br/>
&gt; from Ogguk.  Hope to see you and the rest of DoH there.<br/>
