<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206509117">Prehaps lament could make the PC do the animated cry/frown social, lose you<br/>
as their current target and end up looking at their feet.  Not a very big<br/>
affected, but it would be nice if you&#39;re trying to flee.<br/>
<br/>
Pixie strike is one of the cooler songs we get, and I&#39;ve always envisioned<br/>
it (from the mob&#39;s perspective) that they were literally chasing pixies.<br/>
This could be quite humerous and clever if done right in a pvp sense:  have<br/>
the PC lose you as their current target, to be replaced by this pixie which<br/>
they indeed chase (turn in a random direction and swing at).<br/>
<br/>
As you&#39;ve noticed, I&#39;ve included losing you as their current target as a big<br/>
part and you might be wondering why (and if you understand why you might<br/>
think its too powerful, but let me finish).  If you&#39;re not the target then<br/>
they can&#39;t attack you.  This might be considered too powerful except for the<br/>
fact F7 (default) targets the closest PC (generally that would be YOU) AND<br/>
the minute you attempt to do damage to the character, you are auto targeted,<br/>
hence these songs would facilitate fleeing and maybe a sneak attack/ambush<br/>
if you&#39;re in cahoots with others.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
Oh a semi-unrelated note: I&#39;ve recently moved to very quick, light damage<br/>
weapons when I melee - combine dual wield with warsong or anthem you are<br/>
literally the tazmanian devil of meleeers.  I got to thinking however, how<br/>
does dual wield really work?  Someone speculated that its keyed off your<br/>
primary hand (every swing = chance for dual wield to go off as well).  This<br/>
would suggest getting something like a dirk in the primary and then a heavy<br/>
hitter/proc&#39;ing weapon in the offhand, since you could cheat the system in<br/>
affect if your heavy hitter had a chance to hit quicker than its normal<br/>
delay.  I haven&#39;t experimented, but can anyone elaborate on dual wield<br/>
stragies?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
