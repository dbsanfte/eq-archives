<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034565324">I agree wholeheartedly Anthem.  <br/>

<br/>
Hmm....I play a song, mob runs.  I play another song, mob stops (or close to<br/>
it)....i beat on mob with a weapon.  that seems pretty good...lather, rinse,<br/>
repeat.  So, by using songs *for their intended purpose*  --and-- using songs<br/>
in conjunction *which is also intended* I am now using an &#39;exploit&#39; because<br/>
they could not be bothered to test bard songs to any extent whatsoever.  <br/>
<br/>
I am tired of being a *paying* beta tester.  I am tired of being a cheater<br/>
because they don&#39;t test their own code.  I am tired of being a liar because if<br/>
find a bug.  I am tired of my fun being &quot;bad for the *vision*&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is the customer &quot;service&quot; of Verant (omg i have trouble typing that even)<br/>
that has finally done me in.  This is just a case where then negatives of the<br/>
game have gone so far beyond tolerable that the positives are just not there<br/>
for me anymore.  <br/>
that&#39;s it.<br/>
account cancelled.<br/>
game over.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/rant&gt;<br/>
<br/>
see ya all in the next big one (Shadowbane? Horizons? NWN? dunno...)<br/>

PS: sorry for the big downer...I cannot hide my disappointment with the<br/>
evolution of the game.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There was a particular exploit where two bards could get<br/>
&gt; &gt; together, play this<br/>
&gt; &gt; song (the level 54 one), and the Fear song, and any NPCs in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; effect range<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm, they don&#39;t properly test things and we are the exploiters for<br/>
&gt; discovering this.  Nice.  I think I&#39;m about done playing their game now...<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
