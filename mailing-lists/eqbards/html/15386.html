<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814222080">You sound as disenchanted as I am, Sylly.  Elfson (after the excitment<br/>
of hitting lvl 20) is on another leave of Norrath (much to my guilds<br/>
unhappiness, I am the only bard)<br/>
<br/>
THis is his second leave in about 5 weeks, thats not good.  Last night I<br/>
had 2 hours before a hockey game, and I broke out Baldur&#39;s Gate, and<br/>
starting getting my maxxed out character ready for BG2.<br/>
<br/>
I warned my Thurs night group about this growing unhappiness, but I<br/>
promised them I&#39;d give them at least a month before I bailed on them<br/>
(thats my cleric and I am the only healer besides our pretty imcompetent<br/>
bard)<br/>
