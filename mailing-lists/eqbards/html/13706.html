 </span></blockquote>A bit extreme..  I stop singing all the time to get mobs off me, stop<br/>
attacking too.  That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t start again in 5 seconds, but if<br/>
removing myself from the situation for that time puts the damage back<br/>
where it belongs, it&#39;s worth it.  A wizard needs to know when to stop<br/>
nuking, a ranger needs to know when to stop taunting, a bard needs to<br/>
know when to stop singing.<br/>
