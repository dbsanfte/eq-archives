<br/>
We have been hunting the SG for the plans for the Kilij. It seems the kill <br/>
junk for Giant spawn works in South Ro just like Rathe. When no giants are <br/>
spawned, we kill all the mummies, madmen, and pumas and Giants seem to start <br/>
poping. Heh, not many folks in the desert of S Ro so last night we had a <br/>
train contest for low level junk! Since warriors can use this weapon, lots <br/>
of my guildmates are helping so I have group to hunt there. The SG with the <br/>
plans is fairly low, but we kill any SG that pops for exp. This weapons <br/>
stats show it is heavier than a barbed whip, so I don&#39;t know that I will <br/>
switch to it permanently from banded Thulians. Barbed whips weren&#39;t lore, I <br/>
used to dual wield 2 of them.<br/>
BTW, being a wood elf woman and a RL woman, I think the male art needs some <br/>
improvements! If I have to run around in a skimpy suit dead, why do all my <br/>
male friends have almost full cothing! I even accused one of our paladins of <br/>
getting me killed alot so he could see my undies, hehe. Thank God for Barbs <br/>
and those wonderful kilts! I have only been harassed for being female twice <br/>
seriously and my guildmates all proceeded to gang up and intimidate the <br/>
person sufficiently to end it.<br/>
<br/>
Leveling by accident, playing for fun!<br/>
