<b>Subject:</b> LONG rant about what to look for in Bad group members. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-645330428">/rant on<br/>
Let me give you an example of what to look out for. The dreaded &quot;I&#39;m a level<br/>
xx Ranger/Druid that has never grouped before, and I don&#39;t have to work<br/>
within the group&quot; dewdz.<br/>
<br/>
Went to Lake Rathe to seek a group of Stalwart Adventurers to help me in my<br/>
quest to slay Cyclopses.<br/>
I pick up a level 24 druid,Shaman, and a level 25 warrior, a level 24<br/>
warrior, and another druid. (26 at the time)<br/>
<br/>
I am the puller, and We are doing great. Putting the smack down on<br/>
Cyclopses, I fear away the very rare bad pull. Druids go link dead. I pick<br/>
up a mage and a Necromancer. We do even better! We take Tarsluk(sp) out<br/>
twice, a two Cyclops pull. Everything is going great, until I go link dead.<br/>
I came back, and half the group is dead. Some unknown player trained us with<br/>
some cyclopses, from what I hear, he/she kept running back through us, until<br/>
the things aggord on my party.<br/>
The warrior has to leave after we recoup from that loss, and the Mage asks<br/>
if her Ranger friend can join. (Wood elf ranger)<br/>
We agree, and she starts bitching when I pull in the giant skeletons (as<br/>
anyone knows, when you want cyclopses, you have to pull in the Giant<br/>
Skellies and other yard trash) She decides she is going to pull, because I<br/>
am doing a horrible job.<br/>
(Let me explain the basic group strategy to this point. We help each other.<br/>
NO one dies, no one runs unless everyone does. We pull to our spot, and<br/>
support one another.) She brings in a Cyclops, draws it near us, and begins<br/>
to kite the damn thing around the valley, making the Necromancer and mage<br/>
pets, me, and the Warrior, chase the damn Cyclops around to try and get a<br/>
hit on it, while she casts flame lick or some stupid spell on it. All the<br/>
while, im yelling stay still, along with all the others(Except the mage, of<br/>
course). It decides to finally die, after all the fuss attracted another<br/>
Cyclops, which the warrior and I managed to tank somehow with all the<br/>
casters being OOM. I explain to her that we are a group, and we work as a<br/>
group, and support one another. She says we need to learn to &quot;play with<br/>
them&quot;. Needless to say, over private tell to me, the other group members<br/>
(Except the mage, of course) are not impressed with the ranger&#39;s ability.<br/>
I go to pull again, after being asked to, and I start bringing in a Cyclops<br/>
(I sing chain to pull them. It stops them from aggroing on anyone else while<br/>
you are pulling, and slows them down quite a bit.) and I get back to the<br/>
party, after stating &quot;Incoming Cyclops&quot;. Someone yells over Shout that there<br/>
is a Half dead Cyclops at the zone. So, guess what? Miss Queen kiting of<br/>
Norrath runs off screaming &quot;Ill get it&quot; just as the other Cyclops gets to<br/>
us. We engage this one, stating that we are fighting this Cyclops, and<br/>
begging her to come and help. She brings in her Cyclops, and it starts<br/>
Hammering on me. So, I chain the Cyclops we are fighting, tell the group to<br/>
fight the one we are on and fire up fear. Off runs the cyclopses, with one<br/>
being extremely slow. We start to fight that one, and the Ranger runs off<br/>
after the other Cyclops!<br/>
Needless to say.. Everyone in the group had to zone. I called the retreat,<br/>
and started up fear again. Rangeress screams that we could take them. I<br/>
explain, yes, we could have, if you had been working WITH us.<br/>
<br/>
Very shortly after that, I disbanded the group, after the mage said in tell<br/>
to me &quot;Well, I like grouping with her. I have never died before when with<br/>
her alone. it must be you guys&quot;<br/>
<br/>
/rant off<br/>
<br/>
1.Give the group(or perspective member) a trial period, in which you observe<br/>
how they(him) work within the group. Do they support one another(the other<br/>
members)? Do they seem to follow the group leaders lead?(Your lead)<br/>
<br/>
2.Observe how they talk. are they snide, and flippent? Do they heal<br/>
themselves first, no matter if someone is lower on health? do they<br/>
constantly complain about loot levels/Exp?<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is, a group leaders job, in my opinion, is to keep the group<br/>
alive at all costs, whenever possible. When a group member jeopardizes this,<br/>
it is time to either leave the group, or Dismiss the group member.<br/>
<br/>
I have had a lot of time lately as a group leader. (If ye can&#39;t find groups<br/>
to join.. make yer own!*grin*) It is the group leaders job to determine what<br/>
the party can handle safely. To judge the groups abilities through different<br/>
levels of combat.<br/>
A smart group leader does not test his party unless all Mana users are at<br/>
full, and all are at full health, and are ready.<br/>
It is the leaders job to weed out the bad seeds, and forge a strong group.<br/>
do so politely, and with honor. Let actions be the judge<br/>
<br/>
I have also been in a lot of pickup groups. Best advice I can give is.<br/>
Watch, listen, work in the group. do as the group leader asks. suggest<br/>
tactics if you wish, but do not force them down their throat. If you judge<br/>
the group wanting, take your leave. politely!<br/>
<br/>
but above all else. have fun! but not at other group members expense<br/>
(playing with a dangerous mob, etc)<br/>
It is a game, and things are meant to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
A group that works together, stays alive, and has fun<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a few posts lately about some good groups and nights.  These<br/>
are cool and tell things to look for when I&#39;m in a group (my bard<br/>
basically plays in all pickup groups right now, I play very<br/>
erractically, though this weekend was great, made almost 2 lvls!).<br/>
<br/>
Now the ugly question.  What should I look for to help me identify a bad<br/>
group.  Not having gate, its helpful to make pretty quick judments on a<br/>
group since its hard to get out sometimes (in dungeons).<br/>
<br/>
For example Monday I was with two others (enchanter and shaman) who I<br/>
had done great with the night before.  We picked up three tanks (A<br/>
uber-twinkie warrior, exec axe/crafted at lvl 17, monk and a ranger). <br/>
Playing it safe ( I thought) we were turbo pulling on orc highway (if<br/>
you dont know they are lvl 12-16ish with an occasional &quot;a orc warrior&quot;<br/>
which are like lvl 20 I think, red to me at 15).<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen minutes in (the enchant, shaman and I had been together for an<br/>
hour Monday, but a lvl 15 bard is a flimsy tank against DW caimians and<br/>
crocs).  We heard a &quot;xxxx yells for help&quot;.  All but the monk (out<br/>
pulling) get up, and see the usual.  A soloist mistakingly pulled on of<br/>
the &quot;a orc&quot;s.  We pile on, as the shaman warns the puller we have a big<br/>
fight (these are pretty rough even with a full group).  We have it<br/>
beaten down, both casters OOM, but health is fine, when I look up from<br/>
key mashing and see mine dropping.  Ugh, DB skel decided he didnt like<br/>
my music.  Three /g&#39;s of &quot;Help the bard&quot; from our shaman (he&#39;s good!<br/>
noticed my health before I did), and I am still solo on the DB down to<br/>
1.5 bubs.  Eventually the enchanter&#39;s pet manages to get the DB off<br/>
me(lucky I guess).  At which point the ranger says &quot;Anthem!&quot;.  (I assume<br/>
he finally noticed all the nifty flashing icons were off his screen, as<br/>
I was getting the crap stunned out of me).  Shaman reminds the tank that<br/>
their fair haired bard is the lowest lvl in the group and not much good<br/>
at absorbing damage.  (I tend to not say anything, so he has taken on<br/>
the role for me)<br/>
<br/>
Life goes on...  ABout half hour later, I decide to experiment with<br/>
kabonging.  With all this muscle (even the shaman out damages me with<br/>
his big hammer), I felt my damage wasn&#39;t mattering much and we might be<br/>
better served if I just use the old mandolin.  So I weave Hymm and<br/>
Chordx2 in battle (I only triple in a big fight as it gives me a<br/>
headache), with my mandolin in hand.  After a big pull (2 priests and<br/>
warriors), I am pretty well smushed (below 1 bub), so I&#39;m sitting with<br/>
Hymm going.  I watch the ranger top himself off with heals (the other<br/>
tanks were down around 2 bubs), then cast the damage shield on himself. <br/>
I tell the enchanter and shaman, &quot;Time to Jettison this trash?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In any case what are some good things to look for so I know when to bail<br/>
out?  The group I met on Sunday was great (we played about 6 hours with<br/>
0 deaths in a low-risk zone, closest call was me being saved by a rune<br/>
spell, 2 hp left!), but I think they will out level me too quickly<br/>
(which is usually my problem, any good players I meet out level me<br/>
quickly, guess I should figure out where I stand)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
