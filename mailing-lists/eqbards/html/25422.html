<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325186764">They keep on going, people in my guild have gotten between 400-500 on<br/>
some resists (with bards of course hehe) if they want to try.  The<br/>
question was whether they reset to 0 after 255 or stay at 255 or<br/>
actually are at a value over 255.  Verant said they stay at 255 even if<br/>
they go over.<br/>

Do the numbers even go up after 255? I thought they stayed at 255 on<br/>
your<br/>
screen no matter your resist.  Maybe wrong its been while since I<br/>
played.<br/>
