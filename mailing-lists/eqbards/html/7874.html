<b>Subject:</b> Re: Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474037319">I have minorly twinked my characters.  The items where given to my bard by her<br/>
husband and his brother (both about 10 lvls higher).  My enchanter was twicked by<br/>
her Mom and Dad (the bard & her hubby), as was her brother (&quot;hubby&#39;s&quot; 2nd char).<br/>
<br/>
Do I feel this is improper, No.  I know VERY few people who have never given a<br/>
gift to a lover or child.  I have also seen very few &quot;trophy wives&quot; who where not<br/>
given expensive gifts.<br/>
<br/>
I do however expect that the younger wife would try to find gifts for her &quot;man who<br/>
has everything&quot;, and the child to make a gift for Mommy & Daddy.  My bard is<br/>
always searching vendors for magic Word to give to her magician, and when the Ench<br/>
is older, I suppect she will give gifts to her parents.<br/>
<br/>
Twinking, maybe.  Trade over a very long time period, maybe.  This is just the<br/>
game version of: Do I give the homeless guy on the street a dollar, or do I think<br/>
he&#39;ll just drink it.  Should I give money/time to a charity, am I sure I support<br/>
their goals?<br/>
<br/>
I will keep giving money to the Red Cross and American Cancer Society, but pretend<br/>
I don&#39;t see the bum; and I will help characters I know are trying to play the<br/>
game, and tell the beggers (guild or otherwise) off, publicly so other people<br/>
realize how they &quot;play&quot; the game.</div>
