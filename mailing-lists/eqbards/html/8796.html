<b>Subject:</b> RE: Gypsy Lute? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245625909">it never even crossed my mind to test it, sorry all.  i went straight to<br/>
getting the breastplate.  i am under the assumption that although all of the<br/>
items needed for the lambent armor quests are usable and have stats, they<br/>
are solely meant for these quests.  hopefully someone will do some tests<br/>
before turning it in.<br/>
<br/>
as far as where it comes from, it&#39;s not the named gypsy musician, it is off<br/>
the non-named gypsy musicians.  they merely are &quot;Gypsy Musician&quot; and are in<br/>
the piano room of mistmoore castle.  if they have a lute you can see them<br/>
holding it.<br/>
<br/>
i didn&#39;t get reimbursed, cause in fact i was wrong, like other bards.  makes<br/>
perfect sense though, since the lute of the gypsy princess is totally<br/>
dissimilar to all of the other quest components (off rare named npc, neither<br/>
lore nor no drop).  so far, every component is extremely common on these<br/>
mobs.  the random number generator plays tricks sometimes.  i have gotten<br/>
the item needed on the first or second kill on many occassions (Froon,<br/>
Choon, Solusek Mage), while for a friend it has taken 5 hours (Griffenne<br/>
Charm).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So it appears there is a Lute of the Gypsy Princess and now a <br/>
&gt; Gypsy Lute.  The screenshot of the gypsy lute says +5 Sv <br/>
&gt; Magic which makes me want one simply for that fact.  I&#39;d be <br/>
&gt; curious if anyone gets their hands on this, if maybe this is <br/>
&gt; the equal to the Mistmoore Battle drum (I know this is <br/>
&gt; probably just a fantasy. . . but hey, this is a fantasy game huh? =).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now as to this lute in relation to the quest.  I do not know <br/>
&gt; where the Gypsy Lute comes from except one a person said, <br/>
&gt; &quot;off a named gypsy musician&quot;.  I do not know if this person <br/>
&gt; is in Mistmoore.  I would hope so.  The quest [clue] of &quot;a <br/>
&gt; Gypsy Lute from the Castle of Mistmoore,&quot; is otherwise wrong. <br/>
&gt;  And while EverQuest is an amazing game, we&#39;ve all had our <br/>
&gt; own experiences with Verant that a mistake like this wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; surprise us.  I just hope they reimburse Shada and others <br/>
&gt; that encountered this.<br/>
