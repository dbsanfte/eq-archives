<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123073869">Then we agree, our melee skill falls between hybrids and wis<br/>
casters(remember int casters are even lower).<br/>
<br/>
Of the casters only clerics wear plate, and I believe (again, I wish I had<br/>
my stats in front of me) that our class armor is better ac than theirs (even<br/>
after the improvments, theirs used to be awful ac).  Also most clerics trade<br/>
off ac for wis, so their ac is much worse than ours.  Still, we are not good<br/>
enough to tank anything beyond 30ish.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, anyone who wants their bard to be melee character is going<br/>
to be disapointed.  However, I think this thread began questioning the power<br/>
level of bards.  I hate hearing people who don&#39;t think bards hold up their<br/>
end in a group.  If anything I think we may be overpowered (though once I<br/>
have to start using the mana draining charm song, I may, heh, change my<br/>
tune).  Bard has a reasonably high miminum compotency level, which may lead<br/>
to more badly played bard then some other classes, but a well played should<br/>
add to almost any group.</div>
