<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That was my problem as well.  A good enchanter makes many of our tactics<br/>
&gt;unusable.  I finally stuck on using hymn, warsong, and CoB after making it<br/>
&gt;clear the enchanter should not buff people with Strengthen.  When<br/>
&gt;our ranger wasn&#39;t there I used Chains in place of CoB.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is a reason it might be sticking inconsistently -- Berserker Strength.<br/>
I don&#39;t cast Strengthen on my tanks anymore because Berserker Strength<br/>
overwrites<br/>
it anyway. Berserker Strength is a lvl 20 spell that repeats the prov of the<br/>
PGTomahawk (The thing you get in High Hold) with a decrease in agility,<br/>
increase<br/>
in Strength and small Rune affect (And no reagant needed)<br/>
<br/>
If someone was using a PGT/The Enchanter was casting that on the person<br/>
being<br/>
hit upon, this could be why it was working inconsistently. It worked<br/>
when Berserker Strength wasn&#39;t up. Didn&#39;t work otherwise.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for stacking, if CoB was up Strengthen would stick and CoB would still<br/>
&gt;work, but CoB would not stick after Strengthen.  Also, The Screaming Mace<br/>
&gt;effect will not stick if you are singing CoB, but if Screaming Mace effect<br/>
&gt;goes off first, CoB will stack on top of it.  Weird huh?<br/>
