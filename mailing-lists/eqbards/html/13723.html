<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637935383">Heh maybe except you seem to forget there are less zones to hunt. And why do<br/>
you think your running into 50 druids in your zone? Maybe because it&#39;s not<br/>
near as crowded? On E&#39;ci even during prime time there are maybe 30 peopole<br/>
there 40 tops. You know what we played with 80-90 people there so don&#39;t tell<br/>
me it&#39;s overcrowded.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hell  you forgot some dungeons like Sol A which is baren.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Or mm same thing. Fact of the matter is your argument is<br/>
&gt;&gt; off somewhat because there are zones at your level exmpty<br/>
&gt;&gt; while at mine their aren&#39;t any that are even low.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nope, I didn&#39;t forget Sol A but it&#39;s mostly all camped (King, Bartender,<br/>
&gt;Predator, Foreman, Clockworks, Singe, Kindle and the zone entrance).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unrest basement always has one if not 3 groups in it during prime time<br/>
&gt;with the knight camped, the hand room camped, the barkeep camped and<br/>
&gt;even the rooms on the first and second floor with single spawns in them<br/>
&gt;are camped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Permafrost will have one group working the elite spawns and pulling the<br/>
&gt;diplomat. I always see at least 1 group in the preacher area; sometimes<br/>
&gt;2 as the second group will camp the archaeologist. Lvl 50 druids take up<br/>
&gt;a permanent residence in the King spawn area and the Alchemist is<br/>
&gt;getting to be camped 24/7 as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;MM is starting to become packed as well with 3 groups working the<br/>
&gt;ent/lake area, 2 in the GY, 1 in secret room, 2 working the gargs in the<br/>
&gt;torture chamber area, 1 working ancil valley, 1 working the castle<br/>
&gt;foyer, and a group way in back doing the maid/butler spawns. I&#39;d call<br/>
&gt;that pretty damn camped for the 20-40 spawns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In CT, the TR, achron (2 or 3 groups in the temple), and green pool is<br/>
&gt;defiantly camped. The planks area is getting crowded lately too. During<br/>
&gt;prime time, a second group will clean the foyer portion of TR while<br/>
&gt;being on the waiting list. Always at least 2 or more groups pulling maze<br/>
&gt;into the courtyard. The only spawn that I&#39;m not sure is being worked<br/>
&gt;aggressively on my server if the Avatar himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Upper Guk seems to be less packed but then, the lord and the croc areas<br/>
&gt;are camped 24/7 with the scyer having a waiting list.  The warden, the<br/>
&gt;squire... even the darn spiders are all camped during prime time.  You<br/>
&gt;betcha<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sure I&#39;ve left out some zones but I think I&#39;ve made my point.  It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;just crowding at the +45 level; it&#39;s spread out all over now. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think any one particular lvl group can feel victimized here.  We are all<br/>
&gt;suffering.<br/>
