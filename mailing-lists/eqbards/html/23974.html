As shown by Atonal&#39;s posting of 74 bards at peak time on Xegony, this is<br/>
far less than 5% of the people playing.<br/>
<br/>
This game has a little bit of something for everyone, and therefore should be<br/>
balanced as such.  What&#39;s the percentage of people who go into Veeshans<br/>
Peak or Sleepers Tomb?  Does that mean that those zones are insignificant?<br/>
Not for the people who do go into them.<br/>
<br/>
My argument still stands.  It is pretty narrow minded to say that &#39;&#39;those people<br/>
are a small minority and thus don&#39;t matter&#39;&#39;.  It is pretty easy to say when you aren&#39;t<br/>
on of &#39;&#39;those people&#39;&#39;.  Like I said before, bards are less than 5% of the total peak<br/>
populations on servers, yet, because you are one of them, they aren&#39;t one of &#39;&#39;very,<br/>
very, very, tiny minority&#39;&#39;, that you find it easy to call other folks?<br/>
<br/>
note:  I decided to take your advice and go to eqvault and see how many players were<br/>
playing pvp vs regular.  Even counting test and chat as part of the total, the number<br/>
of players on pvp were 6.92152% of the total number of players on line currently.  Slightly<br/>
more than your 5% number.  Almost double the percentage of bards playing on peak<br/>
on xegony.  So now who is the very very very tiny minority???<br/>

&gt;Anyone can see that there are three pvp servers, each on the lower end of<br/>
&gt;the population base and easily determine how many people at any one time are<br/>
&gt;playing in a potential pvp environment.  Even if those people were all<br/>
&gt;playing pvp all the time and never playing pve, their number would still be<br/>
&gt;insignificant compared to the overall number of players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Get a clue, this is NOT a pvp game except for a very, very, very, tiny<br/>
&gt;minority. </span></blockquote></div>
