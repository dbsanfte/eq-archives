  If someone sells you a car with some options missing, and you take<br/>
  it back to get it fixed and it takes a week to repair..and when you <br/>
  receive it again, some options are still missing?  Don&#39;t you take<br/>
  action?  Aren&#39;t you the slightest bit pissed off?  This isn&#39;t some mud<br/>
  you log into everyday and play around for free.  This is a service that<br/>
  a company is offering to us.  If your power company ups your rate,<br/>
  what do you do?  Call them and tell them to cancel your power, cause<br/>
  you are pissed off?  F no, you don&#39;t do that.  You complain like a <br/>
  mofo and make people aware that it&#39;s unfair.  Verant offers a very<br/>
  attractive service, one which I want to be a part of.  That&#39;s right,<br/>
  I want to play these game with my friends, in fact I pay to play this<br/>
  game with my friends, and that gives me every right to complain about<br/>
  the company until they get it right.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant is making poor decisions, and they have zero, that&#39;s right,<br/>
  zero coordination and testing going on right now.  That much is<br/>
  evident and clear to me.  What really f&#39;ing pisses me off, is that<br/>
  those stupid GMs sat their lazy asses on the Plane of Sky for 2 or<br/>
  3 months, when they could have been testing it out.  Now look at<br/>
  the Plane of Sky, it&#39;s totally busted... The quests dont work, the<br/>
  text in the quests is wrong.  This isn&#39;t unusual, and if you expect<br/>
  us to say they are only human, give them a break everytime they <br/>
  change one thing in this game and it causes a failure, then when are<br/>
  they gonna do something correctly?  Should I give them an A for <br/>
  effort, when they are failing to produce any measurable results?<br/>
  Did you get an A for effort in school, because you tried hard<br/>
  and had your heart in it?  I doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
  I will be the first to congrat Verant on a job well done.  The fact<br/>
  of the matter is, they aren&#39;t doing a good job.  They aren&#39;t even<br/>
  doing a decent job.  They are just bumbling along, until the day<br/>
  that this all crumbles down in a heap of confusion.  If you think <br/>
  that frustrating players is doing a good job, then they are doing<br/>
  terrific at that.  I liked the patch message, I have no complaints<br/>
  about the bard additions.  But I&#39;m tired of them not addressing the<br/>
  real issues at hand, in order to make non-critical adjustments to<br/>
  the game.  The fact that two continents were missing should have<br/>
  clued anyone in to the future of this game.  This game is and will<br/>
  always be incomplete until they address some very big player based<br/>
  problems, including graphic effects, and bugs that have existed <br/>
  since beta.  Verant as a whole _is_ lazy.<br/>
<br/>
  I want to help Verant, I have ideas, I have time to test, I even have<br/>
  the patience to live through their mistakes.  But every g&#39;damn time<br/>
  I log into the game, I&#39;m riddled by bugs, by crashes, by problems.<br/>
  It&#39;s amazing that it even still works, although they will claim it&#39;s<br/>
  never been broken.<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah, I could grow up a little, and lay off the cursing, lay off the<br/>
  Flame Verant bandwagon, but they&#39;ve lost their players admiration in<br/>
  this &#39;vision&#39; they have.  If they want to keep screwing around with<br/>
  things because it fits their ideas of the game they want without<br/>
  considering what the players are looking for in their game, they <br/>
  are bound for a rude awakening.<br/>
