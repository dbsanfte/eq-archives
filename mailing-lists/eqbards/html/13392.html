&gt; running back to your corpse, waiting for mana/hp to<br/>

  I put aside an hour or two each day to sing to all the girls, and<br/>
  tell the tales of Harmonic who single handedly defeated Cazic Thule,<br/>
  how he slashed Maestro with his 6-note blade, how he can solo the Lord<br/>
  Room with his helmet visor down.<br/>

  Now that&#39;s quality time.<br/>
