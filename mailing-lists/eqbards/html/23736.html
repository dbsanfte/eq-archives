My apologies as well, I&#39;ve been a bit touchy lately... for some reason I<br/>
have RL friends who think being in a farily powerful guild means I have lots<br/>
and lots of free stuffs for them.. like I have 6 CoF gathering dust in my<br/>
bank account rather than realizing it means i just die over and over and<br/>
over for warrior loot :)<br/>

&gt; Or are you too new to remember the<br/>
&gt; &gt; chains debacle?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New to a bard, but not to EQ.  Started 2 months after it went live.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes I believe I said I DID read the whole post.  I know <br/>
&gt; they will plan to<br/>
&gt; &gt; downlevel the mobs.  I just hope they actually do it.  It <br/>
&gt; has nothing to<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; with loot but everything to do with conquoring challenges.  <br/>
&gt; I just like<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenges to be fair.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I apologize, then.  I am sick of seeing posts (mainly on eqcasters) of<br/>
&gt; people only seeing the things that upset them and not the <br/>
&gt; other side.  To me<br/>
&gt; your post seemed like you did not see the point of tuning <br/>
&gt; them down.  Again,<br/>
&gt; I apologize, I must have missed that in your post.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as Verant history.  What other choice do you have but <br/>
&gt; to trust that<br/>
&gt; they will do what they say?  Not much other than quit.  I <br/>
&gt; understand not<br/>
&gt; liking the update, but some poeple get *SO* mad, it scares <br/>
&gt; me.  This is a<br/>
&gt; game, nothing more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I for one, would rather play a slightly &quot;nerfed&quot; EQ, then no <br/>
&gt; EQ at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I still think the BP is overpowered the way it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You need to think of what is realistic for the genre not of <br/>
&gt; what would be<br/>
&gt; neat.  I wish my druid had a 1200 point DD, just like wizards <br/>
&gt; wish they<br/>
&gt; could cast SOW.  Melee wish they could bind/gate.  But those <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; sense.  Neither does such a breastplate.  At least not to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am sorry, if offended anyone.  It was not my intent, just <br/>
&gt; expressing my<br/>
&gt; views.<br/>
