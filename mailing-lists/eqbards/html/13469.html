to be a big complaint with monks).<br/>

&gt; Does skill level determine the length of time that it works?  Or whether<br/>
&gt; the MOBs can see you anyway?  Or anything else at all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think your skill level just determines your chance of<br/>
success.  Whether or not you&#39;re really hidden seem to depend<br/>
on the level of the mob and a random factor.  I&#39;ve succeeded<br/>
at hiding, had a green mob turn indifferent while a blue one<br/>
was still amiable.  I then hid again and both were<br/>
indifferent.<br/>
<br/>
You will always disappear from your POV while using this<br/>
skill, whether it succeeds or fails.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4)  Is there any way to know whether Sneak actually worked or not?<br/>
&gt; Other than trying to move and estimating based on your walking speed?<br/>
&gt; What does Sneak do?  Is it just a mobile Hide?  Why do we have Hide<br/>
&gt; then, when you could Sneak and stand still?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s like a mobile hide, except it only works in approximately<br/>
a 270 degree region away from the direction a mob is facing.  <br/>
e.g. If a &quot;ready to attack&quot; mob is facing you and you<br/>
successfully sneak (and the mob can be snuck against :), it<br/>
will still be &#39;ready to attack.&quot;  But if you move 45 degrees<br/>
in either direction, it will change to indifferent.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5)  Are they getting rid of Instill Doubt?  Has anyone ever trained a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will work once in a blue moon.  I heard it&#39;s more<br/>
consistent at 100 skill, but at 45ish skill I only expect it<br/>
to work about once a night.  It is less reliable that Screech,<br/>
but is targeted and has a longer duration.<br/>
