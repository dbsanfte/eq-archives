&gt;Hey folks, I discovered last night that while Lullaby does not<br/>
&gt;interrupt the lizard casters in Cazic (debatable whether this<br/>
&gt;is a change to Lullaby in general, or lizards are just immune<br/>
&gt;or resistant due to shorter casting times), Pixie Strike<br/>
&gt;*does* interrupt them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ummm..what do you mean nod doesnt work on lizzies? I am a bard of the 34th<br/>
chorus on Innoruk and I use nod ALOT in Cazic Thule. My group adores the<br/>
song, especially when we are in 4C hunting on top of the temple for the<br/>
Archon (grin). That song REALLY has saved us ALOT of times! A perfect<br/>
example was earlier this week. 2 rangers, a shaman, wizard, monk and I were<br/>
on top of 4C. At the steps was 2 protectors a justicar and fanactic. What we<br/>
DIDN&#39;T know was there were a few more ..right around the corner.... Well I<br/>
nodded the lot and we picked em off one at a  time..just as we started in on<br/>
the third another protector decided to come play..but the song nodded him<br/>
off and he just STOOD there doing nothing...We ressted and healed then<br/>
continued the battle..hehe lizzies zero..us 6! Don&#39;t know why it works for<br/>
me but not you....<br/>
