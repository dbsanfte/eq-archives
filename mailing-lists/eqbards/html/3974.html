<div id="ygrps-yiv-760304305">Hello Tszaaz,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Actually I would like to request folks offer little<br/>
detail besides the zone (unless something is a<br/>
deathtrap for a level 17, THAT would be appreciated)<br/>
as exploring is 90 percent of the fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have you taken dive into Lake Rathe? There are some<br/>
interesting things there. There are some dangers but<br/>
most if not all can avoided or dealt with if you keep<br/>
an eye on where you are. There are also rumors of a<br/>
sea monster, but I have heard some say it was just in<br/>
beta. Don&#39;t know for sure. But I do know I have been<br/>
swimming there a long time and have never seen<br/>
anything like that. Its an interesting zone if you<br/>
have never been. If you go you might see tons of<br/>
people of there. But don&#39;t let that fool you. 99% of<br/>
the people will be sitting on top of each other at the<br/>
gnoll camp :) Leaving you, for the most part, with the<br/>
run of the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Safe travels,<br/>

&gt; Er, if it&#39;s OOT a<br/>
&gt; general loc would be appreciated too, while I would<br/>
&gt; LOVE to search the whole<br/>
&gt; OOT I just don&#39;t have that kinda time *laughs*.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any favorites folks have?<br/>
