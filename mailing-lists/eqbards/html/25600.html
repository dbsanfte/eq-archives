<b>Subject:</b> What about the Drum graphic? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-48882389">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Long time lurker here. I haven&#39;t played in a while, but was wondering if <br/>
anyone had heard whether or not the overhaul being done to the character <br/>
models will include an actual drum graphic for bards? Last I recall, quite <br/>
some time ago, when asked whether or not they&#39;d be correcting it, they said <br/>
they couldn&#39;t because it was too involved to address at the time.<br/>
<br/>
However, since they&#39;re re-doing the models for Luclin, I wonder if it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be the perfect opportunity to fix this animation? Just wondering <br/>
if anyone knew of their intentions?<br/>
<br/>
If any of you all get Luclin up and running tomorrow and find out, if you <br/>
could post to the list that would be great.. I doubt my copy of Luclin will <br/>
come in for a couple days yet. Thanks!<br/>
