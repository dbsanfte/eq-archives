<div id="ygrps-yiv-410335082">Actually my experience was even when I first got the song it was seldom<br/>
resisted even by yellows provided I used my lute.  Without the lute it was<br/>
often resisted by whites even.  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t do enough testing for<br/>
a statistically sound sample, but resists appeared to occur about 20% less<br/>
with the lute and last about twice as long on the average.  Your mileage may<br/>
vary.<br/>

Think back to your younger days at the orc and derv camps.  The mobs will<br/>
vary in level such that when she is first trying this the higher ones will<br/>
resist and go agro when hit with the song.  When you first get the song it<br/>
is not as strong as it will be in even 2 more levels. <br/>
<br/>
Rather than tell her to lament them all without regard to their con nor the<br/>
order in which you apply the song, I suggest lamenting from the lower con to<br/>
the higher con.  And like they say - learn about agro radius of mobs and how<br/>
to avoid pulling thru - even lamented mobs. <br/>

Yes, it seems that Lament only lowers the agro radius of the mob, not<br/>
necessarily reducing it to zero.  I also try to lament the farther mobs and<br/>
pull the other so it doesn&#39;t run right thru the lamented ones, possibly<br/>
activating them.  This has been almost universally successful for me.<br/>
