<b>Subject:</b> RE: Kith Nerfed!!!  Re: Undead drops in Kithicor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-605978770">You&#39;re joking!  I went through Kithicor last night going from Freeport to<br/>
Qeynos and there was a red undead every 100 feet (and I&#39;m level 31 now).  I<br/>
rode the top of the zone wall like a frightened little schoolgirl.  Corpses<br/>
strewn all over the place.  It was sad.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I spent the whole night in Kithicor, sat in the burned out cabin while<br/>
&gt; my cleric friend ran from north karana to collect the book that spawns<br/>
&gt; there. In that time I saw nothing but the usual bixies and orcs on<br/>
&gt; tracking. No undead, not even a normal ghoul. I have spoken to other<br/>
&gt; people on the server some of whom wanted to hunt the undead spawn in<br/>
&gt; Kithicor, and it seems that, on Rodcet Nife at least, Kithicor has<br/>
&gt; returned to its original pre-haloween state.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if this applies to other servers or whether Rodcet<br/>
&gt; himself has intervened and removed the undead from the server that<br/>
&gt; bears him name.<br/>
