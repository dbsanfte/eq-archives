&gt;Level 68 Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>

&gt;On Wednesday August 11, 1999 there was a strange happening on the Fennin Ro<br/>
&gt;server. As it seems, there was a level 68 Wood Elf Bard. This may and<br/>
&gt;probably was a bug but it is interesting to note nonetheless.<br/>

&gt;Thanks! (Note: The character was most likely controlled by an employee of<br/>
&gt;Verant, although this remains unconfirmed.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>on Vallon Zeck the 2nd day of the server being up there was a level 69<br/>
character on the server.  I forgot the race and class off hand.  I would<br/>
definately say it was probably one of the game designers testing things,<br/>
and they didn&#39;t want to be bothered with any mobs messing with them.<br/>
