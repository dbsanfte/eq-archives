&gt;Anthem + 20% FBSS = Max Haste (75% at level 50)).  The error was a<br/>
&gt;problem with how the Game added haste effects (10% Haste was listed<br/>
&gt;as 110, 20% as 120 - 110+120=230=Exceeds max haste at 175).  Several<br/>
&gt;months ago Verant fixed that bug and now haste adds as it was<br/>
&gt;intended (i.e 10% Anthem + 20% FBSS = 30% Haste) (110+120=130).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From what I understand, the haste is broken on these things at this<br/>
&gt;time and they add 0% Haste.  VI may fix them in the future, so you<br/>
&gt;may want to think about keeping them.. but, if you can get 18k for a<br/>
&gt;broken item, take the deal in a heartbeat I say. :)  You also may<br/>
&gt;want to test them yourself to make sure they are broken or to find<br/>
&gt;out that they&#39;re not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is truly fascinating to witness and begin to comprehend the levels of <br/>
programming that Verant put into this.  This is the third major math <br/>
mistake we&#39;ve seen that I can recall off the top of my head*, and it took <br/>
how long to fix?  And there have been (and continue to be) how many <br/>
mistakes in the text-based portions of the game?<br/>
<br/>
  Nevertheless, I suppose we should be thankful that things are getting <br/>
fixed at all.  But I wonder how long it will be until the focus of the <br/>
company shifts, and EQ is no longer a priority?<br/>
