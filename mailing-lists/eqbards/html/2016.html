<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-714477253">WOW!   Thanks for all the great replies, fellow Bards! If I were to reply<br/>
individually, I&#39;d surely fill up everyone&#39;s mailbox with a  lot of &quot;Thank<br/>
you!&quot; Notes, so I will just say thanks to everyone in this one message!<br/>
THANKS!!! Some more info, and then another interesting question follows...<br/>
<br/>
Some more info: The &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; was looted off one of the<br/>
Gypsies slain in Mistmoor. I can not say which since I was not there to do<br/>
the slaying (smile). A group of mid to low 30&#39;s took her, and the person who<br/>
got the lute had travelled with me and msgd me to see if I wanted it. HECK<br/>
YEA I wanted it, even if it DIDN&#39;T have any &quot;mystical powers&quot;. I still think<br/>
Verant SHOULD make some magic instruments, or perhaps bardic weapons that<br/>
count as instruments, or instruments that have better effects than standard<br/>
ones, but I digress.<br/>
Anyway, I paid 15 plat for the Lute, and even if it is useless, I shall keep<br/>
it to add to my collections. (smile) I tested it some more with the Healing<br/>
song and there&#39;s no difference in the numbers between it and a normal Lute.<br/>
<br/>
Also, many thanks for the help finding Nostrolo the bard in S. Karana.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to another question:<br/>
I had a Paladin last night tell me after a battle to play the Jig O Vigor. I<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure why, since Stamina replenishes a heck of a lot faster than HP.<br/>
And you know what he told me? The Jig O Vigor actually HELPS INCREASE THE<br/>
RATE OF MANA RESTORATION!  I thought at first that this was bull, and over a<br/>
few hours tried to test it with some mages. They all agreed that it did,<br/>
indeed, help (however slightly) them restore mana!  Has anyone else tried<br/>
this? Does everyone else KNOW about this already and I am just now leaving<br/>
the stoneage? Any input??<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the great discussion!<br/>
