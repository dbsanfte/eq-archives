<b>Subject:</b> Favorite Kiting Spots <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295767393">Just thought I&#39;d share some of my favorite kiting spots. These are spots <br/>
that are generally flat, or are open enough that you can view from 3rd <br/>
person without too much hassle. Also, they are relatively free of any <br/>
troublesome wandering mobs. Of course, those people who just hang out in <br/>
1st person view, probably don&#39;t worry about hills. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Rathe Mtns:<br/>
Hill Giants - The hill that the hill giants walk around is surrounded by a <br/>
generally narrow canyon. However, in the southwest corner is an open valley <br/>
with a few low rolling hills that makes this a nice kiting spot. The area <br/>
in front of the hill (by the lizardman camps) is generally camped by groups <br/>
and I&#39;ve had some run-ins with people getting our pulls mixed up and <br/>
sometimes having my hill giant aggro on them. Best to stay away from <br/>
groups. This area does have the disadvantage of having some hg spawns in <br/>
it, however, from a bard&#39;s perspective, in this zone, that&#39;s only a plus as <br/>
you mow through the hill giants here and are constantly looking for more.<br/>
<br/>
Cyclopses/Giant Skels - Near the cyclops/giant skeleton area is a gypsy <br/>
camp. There&#39;s a nice flat region just North of this where I found I could <br/>
kite fairly easily. The only drawbacks are that people run by and try to <br/>
&quot;help&quot; you. Also, every now and then an unkempt druid will attack you or <br/>
your pet, but I always had my pet just kill them for me.<br/>
<br/>
The Overthere:<br/>
Pretty much anywhere, it&#39;s wide open. I did like the area near the columns <br/>
leading out from the chasm in the middle as it&#39;s not so hilly and I never <br/>
ran into Dragoons.<br/>
<br/>
Frontier Mountains:<br/>
Forest Giants - I&#39;ve only hunted forest giants here. There&#39;s a beautiful <br/>
spot to the right outside of their fort (looking at it from the front <br/>
gates). It&#39;s wide and flat and nothing seems to roam through here, unlike <br/>
the area in front of the fort. I&#39;ve fear/chained them here as well and <br/>
their path takes them towards the front of the fort, so start the fear well <br/>
away from the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
The Dreadlands: I had read that there was a &quot;safe spot&quot; behind the forest <br/>
giant castle. Turns out to be way too narrow for good kiting. However, just <br/>
to the west, over a hill is a little dilapidated lean to. This little <br/>
valley has been very nice to me and is where I currently reside, killing <br/>
various forest giants, spiders and drolvarg&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Oasis:<br/>
Spectres - The area close to &quot;the shelf&quot; by the southern ro zone seems to <br/>
have less buggy tracks that the spectres flee in. &quot;The shelf&quot; is located in <br/>
the southwestern corner.<br/>
Sand Giants - Usually in the flat plains close to the northern ro zone in <br/>
the middle. I stay away from the sides to avoid the croc/orc hunting <br/>
parties. Also, some sand giants spawn near &quot;the shelf&quot;. Unfortunately, <br/>
there&#39;s usually others pulling sand giants, so you don&#39;t get a chance to <br/>
charm kite too often.<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost:<br/>
Ice Giants/Icy Orcs - Plains north of the icy orcs not too far away from <br/>
gates to permafrost. When I kited these guys I only had 1 chant and my <br/>
bellows. If you are getting any lag at all, I&#39;d recommend against trying <br/>
this. If it wasn&#39;t for lag, they would have never touched me. I never tried <br/>
to charm them, but reading the eqbard&#39;s list, sounds like you have to be <br/>
within combat distance to get it to stick. Wasn&#39;t very profitable for me, <br/>
but was fun to say I did it.</div>
