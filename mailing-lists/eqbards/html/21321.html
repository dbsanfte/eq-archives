&gt; The only way your system would work is if you couldn&#39;t easily switch the PvP<br/>
&gt; off.  In other words, if you PK someone, then it should be a major pain in<br/>
&gt; the arse for you to revert back to PvP-.  And your victim should have ample<br/>
&gt; opportunity to track you down to try and get his stuff back.  Good idea<br/>
&gt; though.  Asheron&#39;s Call has such a system on their care bear servers but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know how well it works.<br/>

having a waiting period, like 10 days, before the change in status goes<br/>
active.<br/>
