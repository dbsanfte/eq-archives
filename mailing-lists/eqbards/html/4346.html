 </span></blockquote>Depends, if you are hunting Blackburrow then that would be a drag...if you<br/>
venture out farther, then it would make sense. There is no one solution that<br/>
covers all situations. Currently I am bound in the bank in Highpass Keep,<br/>
which is great...unless I arrive during the middle of a pitched battle...And<br/>
of course, there is no bank in the Arena...<br/>
It was just an idea, the &quot;then everyone will want something that works that<br/>
way&quot; argument isn&#39;t very convincing...so it remains, just an idea, one I<br/>
like. :o)<br/>
