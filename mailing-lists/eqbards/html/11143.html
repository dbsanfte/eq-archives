<div id="ygrps-yiv-882387629">Welcome to Veeshan friend.<br/>
<br/>
Strength is a question a good many bards will disagree with me on - many<br/>
like to play tank, so to them, str is very important for carrying heavy<br/>
armor and damage.<br/>
<br/>
As far as being a bard - bard - str isn&#39;t that important to our song<br/>
capability.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at the bonuses on Lambent - str is not nearly one of the most<br/>
important staff Verant gave us - not that I&#39;d automatically assume anyone<br/>
there REALLY knows what a bard needs, hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
And no - your weapon is hand to hand - although I&#39;ve NEVER had mine raise a<br/>
single point if a instrument was equipped. I think there might be something<br/>
screwy in the code where hand to hand only raises if you are totally<br/>
without anything in your grasp - or maybe it&#39;s just been me.<br/>
<br/>
Our hand to hand caps pretty low anyway, so don&#39;t ever think you&#39;re gonna<br/>
do much more than scratch a mob with it.<br/>
<br/>
Piercing and 1h slash pretty much cover most weapons a bard is likely - or<br/>
really wants to use. Again, debate on this depending if you plan on playing<br/>
a support (singing/playing bard) or a battle bard in there trying to swing<br/>
with the tanks.<br/>
<br/>
Here is one tip tho - you can tank in a pinch, but after awhile - you&#39;ll<br/>
soon come to realize bards are NOT tanks, no matter how much some may wish<br/>
they were.<br/>

&gt;Hi all, I&#39;m making a bard as a secondary character to my cleric.  Just<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;few basic questions, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re hearing for the 4356th time on the<br/>
&gt;list.  Sorry for the clutter... (But to be honest all the online guides<br/>
&gt;I found were useless)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Stats, stats, stats...  To str or not to str... Tis better to dex<br/>
&gt;than...<br/>
&gt;In other words, what are your thoughts on starting stats?  I was<br/>
&gt;thinking of making a half elf, since I want the better vision, and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;played a wood elf before...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What skill is used when you kabong somebody with your lute?  Hand to<br/>
&gt;hand?  1HB?  I figured it would be worth a practice for all those times<br/>
&gt;I attack with an instrument...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any other general starting advice?  I won&#39;t be twinking myself with my<br/>
&gt;cleric.  (who was started on a new server for me (veeshan) to prevent<br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;first character from twinking him) (not a judgment on twinkers, I just<br/>
&gt;think it detracts from the fun, to each their own)<br/>
