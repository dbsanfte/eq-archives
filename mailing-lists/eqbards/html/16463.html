&gt; I&#39;d sing Berserker, Niv&#39;s, CoC.  Everyone assisted wonderfully and the first<br/>

&gt; yes, he&#39;d been beating on me) and he would have a noticable amount of his<br/>

Wakizashi), or weapons + CoC without a lute.  The damage from<br/>
this song is, to put it mildly, outlandish.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; In that instance Binding only has a minor AC drop and a AE effect over<br/>
&gt; Chains.  Well I don&#39;t want mobs agrod on me if all I&#39;m doing is slowing them<br/>
&gt; and dropping their AC, however, with a DoT component I feel that it&#39;s worth<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve actually been dropping Beserker&#39;s for CoD (yes, the level<br/>
2 song) if there&#39;s only 1-2 tanks in the party.  Their job is<br/>
to soak up damage, not dish it out.  Rogues are an exception.  <br/>
I figure the extra damage from CoD (with a lute since I<br/>
already have it equipped for CoC) provides more benefit than<br/>
the slowdown with Chain or Binding would.  I still keep Chain<br/>
loaded for runner control though.<br/>
<br/>
Standard songs in AE-capable locations is Hymn + Niv&#39;s + CoC +<br/>
CoD (you have more leeway with the DoTs since they last 3<br/>
pulses).  If we&#39;re not taking much damage, I may substitute<br/>
Beserker&#39;s for Niv&#39;s or Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
The other song I&#39;ve been keeping loaded almost full-time<br/>
lately is Screech.  With Hymn + Niv&#39;s, Screech can give you<br/>
enough time where you can handle a 3-mob situation that would<br/>
normally kill you.  Last night as I was leaving Sol B, there<br/>
were 2 Solusek kobolds and one greater kobold shaman at the<br/>
zone.  Both SKs were too high level to charm.  Normally I can<br/>
take any of these solo using Hymn + Niv&#39;s + CoC + CoD.  An SK<br/>
and GK I can usually take.  But 2 SKs and a GK?  They beat me<br/>
down to half before I&#39;d even taken 10% of their hp off.  At<br/>
that point, I switched to CoC, CoD, Screech; Hymn, Niv&#39;s until<br/>
they returned, repeat.  The pet died, some other people<br/>
started hacking at the SKs (which were still attacking me),<br/>
the GK died, an SK died (I got the kill), and a group managed<br/>
to &quot;steal&quot; the other SK from me.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all our songs require time to blossom into their full<br/>
effect.  Screech buys you free time in an crowded zone.<br/>
<br/>
Just over one more bubble til VoV.  That may tip the balance<br/>
once I figure out how significant the AC bonus from it is.<br/>
