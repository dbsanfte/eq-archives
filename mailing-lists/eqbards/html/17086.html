<div id="ygrps-yiv-497012494">Hmm, the exe room, I need to spend more time in Guk (not)  so my directions<br/>
are kinda rough.  From the bedroom, head for the tower (left tunnel to<br/>
vampire bat room, left tunnel again but *hug* the right wall to avoid agro<br/>
the Greater Ice Bone Skels - or kill them - they see thru invis to undead.)<br/>
As you cross the bridge to the tower, you can jump off on the left side. Now<br/>
one way is to the lower tower rooms and the other way is to the jail and the<br/>
lord room further in.  Head for the tower lower rooms.  Off one of the rooms<br/>
is a small room with some cells (4) and troll prisoners (iirc).  In the<br/>
center is the chopping block and iirc that is where the exe spawns.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I just looked at my maps and made some notes for you:<br/>

<br/>
&gt;    The executioner is really pretty easy.  I think there are also 3 other<br/>
&gt; frogs that spawn in the same room.  So there is a possibility that there<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   As far as directions, I can&#39;t really describe that too well, but maybe<br/>
&gt; someone here will be a bit more helpful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bien<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, the point is now I need advice on our next camp spot. which is...<br/>
&gt; &gt; (drumroll)<br/>
