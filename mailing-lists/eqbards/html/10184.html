<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My questions are these:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Is what I am doing wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely not.  I think what you&#39;re doing is wonderful.  I really wish that<br/>
I would have gotten into the &quot;merchant&quot; business myself.  A friend of mine<br/>
is the trading, buy-low/sell-high fiend.  He constantly has incredible items<br/>
and mountains of loot.  Unfortunately, it can really cut into your actual<br/>
&quot;adventuring&quot; time.  I was one of those players who _never_ did any quests<br/>
in my lower levels, and generated all my loot from creatures that I could<br/>
beat solo (I grouped maybe twice from level 1 - 15).  Needless to say, I was<br/>
one miserably poor bard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I <br/>
&gt; am a twink?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All you can do is explain to them.  Some will think you&#39;re a twink anyway.<br/>
Nothing you can do to change their opinion, so I wouldn&#39;t even bother.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this <br/>
&gt; character.  And, I <br/>
&gt;   never thought twice about it until I was reading some <br/>
&gt; recent posts. Will I <br/>
&gt;   be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heck no.  You have every right to play your character however you see fit.<br/>
If others disagree... big deal.  It&#39;s a computer game.... no one should get<br/>
that aggravated over a game (even though they do).<br/>
