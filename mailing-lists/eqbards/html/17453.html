<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Without resending this thread, the discussion was<br/>
&gt; about whether specific <br/>
&gt; character types should be allowed to lotto for<br/>
&gt; specific items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My own stance on this is:  if it isn&#39;t no-drop/not<br/>
&gt; bard, or lore/I <br/>
&gt; already own it, I have a right to lotto for it. <br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t Baldur&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Gate, where I&#39;m controlling a party of six, and I<br/>
&gt; maximize my personal <br/>
&gt; effectiveness by putting the best equipment with the<br/>
&gt; most appropriate <br/>
&gt; character.  I&#39;ve got one character in this game. <br/>
&gt; Me.  There isn&#39;t a <br/>
&gt; prayer that I would buy the &quot;he can use it better&quot;<br/>
&gt; argument in a pickup <br/>
&gt; group, and seeing just how often players pick up and<br/>
&gt; move between guilds, <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t even buy it at the guild level. Among very<br/>
&gt; close, trusted <br/>
&gt; friends, I&#39;ll do it, but even then only if it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t happen repeatedly. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even if I can&#39;t use the item effectively, it&#39;s still<br/>
&gt; a tradeable item <br/>
&gt; that I can use to get something I CAN use.  And if I<br/>
&gt; start to buy in to <br/>
&gt; the &quot;he can use it better&quot; argument, I&#39;ll never get<br/>
&gt; anything but <br/>
&gt; instruments, and I&#39;ll certainly never have anything<br/>
&gt; lying around my bank <br/>
&gt; to allow me to trade up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I&#39;m good enough to be in the group, I&#39;m good<br/>
&gt; enough to lotto for any <br/>
&gt; item the group gets.  If they can use it better than<br/>
&gt; I can, they can <br/>
&gt; trade me something for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not a complete hard-ass about this, btw.  My<br/>
&gt; first FG run, when the <br/>
&gt; leader asked all melee types to lotto for mith arms,<br/>
&gt; I rolled (to the <br/>
&gt; annoyance of many) and won (to the even greater<br/>
&gt; annoyance of many).  I <br/>
&gt; gave them to my level 50 warrior friend.  But he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; given ME stuff, and I <br/>
&gt; know he&#39;s not going to take them and sell them on<br/>
&gt; EBay or anything.<br/>
