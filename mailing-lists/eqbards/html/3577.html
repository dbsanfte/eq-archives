&gt; As you get  higher level, you will forget less and less about binding.  The<br/>
&gt; other night I went back to Freeport from Mistmoore and you know what?  I had<br/>
&gt; no idea where I was bound - thats how long it had been.  I did auction that<br/>
&gt; I was  looking for a bound and a kindly female woodelf did me the favor<br/>
&gt; (took less than 2 minutes off the boat).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly! I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I have 2 bind points that I bounce back<br/>
and forth between: Faydwer (anywhere) and Antonica (anywhere). Did I mention I<br/>
really hate the Freeport/Butcherblock boat route? :-)<br/>
