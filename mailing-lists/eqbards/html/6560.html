<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581465134">I have talked to her and just figured that she is some how related to the<br/>
corrupt guards quest.  Prolly have to go find the guard she mentions and see<br/>
what he has to say.  I heard that there is one out there somewhere that was<br/>
trying to charge travelers tolls.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I recently (altho b4 this last patch) talked to Lady Shae in Freeport<br/>
and after enough red wine she tells you all of her secrets - including the<br/>
name of some guy who has this list that Kane wanted - also she hints at her<br/>
romantic involvement with him.  So, add that together with the Clothspinner<br/>
sisters quest and we have a regular tale of intrigue!<br/>
<br/>
BTW: here&#39;s an excerpt from my adventures last knight::<br/>
<br/>
&lt;The rain stopped as quickly as it had started.  A weary traveler named<br/>
&quot;Seer&quot; approached the stone bridge to the southern plain of Karana...&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bridge Guard Sylly:  HALT!<br/>
Bridge Guard Fozzle:  Halt - Who goes there?<br/>
Bridge Guard Tinina: Halt in the name of Ant-Sylly-onius Bayle!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;puzzled look on the weary traveler&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bridge Guard Sylly: You MUST pay 5sp to cross the bridge - toll! <br/>
<br/>
&lt;very puzzled look on the weary traveler&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bridge Guard Fozzle: Pay up or she will summon the guards!<br/>
<br/>
Seer: pay? wtf pay? you have no right to ......<br/>
<br/>
Bridge Guard Tinina: Har! Pay up or you will have to listen to her singing!!<br/>
<br/>
Seer: &lt;smiles&gt; Oh no!  Not THAT!!! <br/>
<br/>
&lt;Seer puts 10pp in my trade screen - hehe - I click cancel&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bridge Guard Sylly:  Guards!  Let this one pass!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;It begins to rain...&gt;<br/>

		Has anyone ever met the Bard NPC &quot;Misty Storyswapper&quot; in<br/>
Qeynos Hills?  She<br/>
		appears to be the beginning of a Bard-related Quest, but I<br/>
can&#39;t get<br/>
		anything more out of her than the name of a guard she&#39;s<br/>
afraid of...<br/>
