<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522765897">Well that would explain the &quot;hell&quot; level terminology.  I was almost 3<br/>
bubbles ahead of my wife&#39;s warrior and she&#39;s about to ding 35... I&#39;m down to<br/>
a bubble lead and I play a lot more :-).  Of course she hasn&#39;t died once<br/>
since 30.   Then again, she only has 1 or 2 mobs pounded away on her massive<br/>
AC and huge amount of HP as she runs to zone after the evac druid dies...<br/>
meanwhile I&#39;ve been dead for 2 minutes because every mob in the train<br/>
decided the bard playing clarity needed to die first giving her a nice head<br/>
start to zone.  And to make matters worse, if I was able to screech enough<br/>
of them away for the evac, the cleric trying to keep me alive and I both<br/>
tend to be dead before evac goes off because of the casters outside my<br/>
screech range that don&#39;t like me screaching and don&#39;t like him healing and I<br/>
can&#39;t be weaving MR at the same time.  Ahh, the life of a bard...<br/>

&gt; You definitely lose less visually at 30 and 35 because the xp needed at<br/>
&gt; those levels is higher.  At 36th a full bubble is equal to about a 1/4<br/>
&gt; bubble at 35th.  I know that its silly, but its what everyone seems to<br/>
&gt; observe.  My druid friend died at 30th 3 times, losing a quarter bub or<br/>
less<br/>
&gt; each time.  1 death at 29 was 3/4 and both deaths at 31 were nearly a full<br/>
&gt; bubble as well.  same thing happened at 34-36th though 35th took about 3<br/>
&gt; times the number of kills of similar creatures to advance than 36th did.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been noticing something wierd regarding this as well.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; told that 31 and above was hell level because this is where you started<br/>
&gt; loosing a full bubble with a death instead of a half bubble.  I&#39;m now 35<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I died 7 times this past weekend (yeah, REAL bad weekend for me), never<br/>
once<br/>
&gt; loosing more then a quarter bubble (I came out of the weekend with almost<br/>
&gt; one bubble into 35 which is slightly less then where I started).  Some of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; deaths were to high blues and most were to red (the ones in lower Guk).<br/>
When<br/>
&gt; I was 32, I distinctly recall loosing about 3/4 of a bubble on a bad pull.<br/>
&gt; I usually don&#39;t pay that much attention to my XP bar unless I&#39;ve just died<br/>
&gt; or am about to level (which was the case at 32) so I don&#39;t know how much I<br/>
&gt; lost with my deaths at levels 33 and 34.  The other possibility is that<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; have changed the amount of XP loss from a death on one of the recent<br/>
&gt; patches?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On another note, does anyone have any advice for pulling in MM or a good<br/>
&gt; place to camp?  I was wiped 3 times there last night alone from really bad<br/>
&gt; ugly looking trains that seemed to include the WHOLE castle, all of them<br/>
&gt; coming out through the graveyard (which I had imagined would be safer).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, Prexus has officially grown up I think.  1700 people on it last night<br/>
&gt; and I couldn&#39;t find anywhere to hunt in Sol B or in Lower Guk (EVERYTHING<br/>
&gt; was camped)... But when I got to MM, there were only about 12 people in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; zone... now I know why.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I made 30th level over the holidays and since then have died twice.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; first time I died was in the assasin room in lower guk.  I got killed by<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of the undead ghoul wizards (conned red to me). I noticed that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; amount of experience on the bar didn&#39;t visually drop very much.  Second<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; I died I was in Mistmoore.  Party was fighting in the secret room behind<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; crypt when we got a bad pull.  Deathly harbingers and ushers beat me up<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty good.  Started running to the zone when a pledge familiar (caster<br/>
&gt; &gt; type) joined in the fight.  Pledge familiars con either low blue or<br/>
green<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; me.  Even though the deathly harbingers and ushers did 90% of the damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; against me, the pledge familiar got in the killing blow.  I noticed that<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience bar visually dropped a lot more this death than it did when<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; red ghoul wizards killed me.  I have noticed a similar trend over the<br/>
life<br/>
&gt; &gt; of my bard as well.  Just paid more attention it to it now that I&#39;m in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; hell level.  Subjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; dying is higher when something kills you that cons green/blue to you<br/>
&gt; versus<br/>
&gt; &gt; something killing you that cons yellow/red.  Anyone else had similar<br/>
&gt; &gt; results?<br/>
