&gt; I&#39;m gonna apologize, Lyrnia, because in the context it was an<br/>
&gt; insensitive comment.  My comment wasn&#39;t really directed at you in<br/>
&gt; particular but in general when I see people post &quot;Blah Blah since<br/>
&gt; Beta 1&quot; as part of their sig line, it usually comes when they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; contradicting someone else&#39;s opinion... To me, it seems like they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; saying, &quot;I&#39;ve been around longer than you, so I know.&quot;  I really<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t buy into that philosophy and personally don&#39;t think there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; anything more special about a Level 60 Bard compared to a Level 25<br/>
&gt; Bard.  Or someone who&#39;s been playing since 4000 BC vs. someone who<br/>
&gt; bought the game yesterday.  Obviously, not everyone who uses a<br/>
&gt; similar sig is implying the same thing and that&#39;s where some more<br/>
&gt; information would have been important to illustrate what I meant.<br/>
&gt; Sorry for what looked like a cheap shot.<br/>
