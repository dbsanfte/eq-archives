<div id="ygrps-yiv-614959735">There a lot of people who just don&#39;t have a clue as far as the value of<br/>
a bard in a group.  The bottom line is that you have to fight differently to<br/>
be effective with a bard.  If the group&#39;s  tactics are simply - have the<br/>
tanks tank as hard as possible - and have the casters blow all there mana as<br/>
quickly as possible - kill the critters - hope you don&#39;t die - then go to<br/>
and heal and re-gen mana - wait for spawn (if hasn&#39;t yet) Repeat...  These<br/>
are the people who will yell &quot;Play the Heal Song&quot; in combat when they get<br/>
down to 2 bubbles.  For that type of strategy - I would tend to agree with<br/>
the argument against Darkfox (Blitz Krieg) on the board.  There are other<br/>
classes that will clearly outpace us in a simple strategy like that.<br/>
<br/>
    Clearly this isn&#39;t the best way to play Everquest.  Perhaps in certain<br/>
situations (especially when dealing with Kill Stealers and the goal is<br/>
simply to get a kill as quickly as possible)  But IMHO it would be utterly<br/>
boring.  The analogy in war - is simple frontal assaults all the time (both<br/>
sides never learned that lesson in WW1 and the Japanese never learned that<br/>
one in WW2)...<br/>
<br/>
    I play on Xegony - started in Freeport.  When I started soloing around<br/>
level 5 or 6 - I never had a problem finding a group - in fact I&#39;d<br/>
constantly have people ask me to join their group when I was already in a<br/>
group!  However - when I went to Faydwer at level 8 (stayed there for a<br/>
level or two) I did have problems getting into groups.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s<br/>
that the majority of the people in a particular area don&#39;t know how to use a<br/>
bard; or the majority of the bards don&#39;t know how to play properly (giving<br/>
bards a bad name) - or maybe even the types of monsters don&#39;t lend<br/>
themselves to bardic fighting styles (doubtful IMHO)<br/>
<br/>
    So my advise is to do that bardic thing and travel until you find an<br/>
area where the players know how to use a bard..   I did great alternating<br/>
between East Commons and North Ro at your level - time to take the boat<br/>
ride!<br/>
