I have Journeyman Boots, from the time when they dropped in Najena.<br/>
<br/>
It was a...12 hour camp if I recall correctly.  And I did it about a week<br/>
before they changed the quest.<br/>
<br/>
We had a little drama when a high-level wizard wandered in (kill stealer alert<br/>
oh no!!).  We had one person take a trip to town for supplies and drinks (and<br/>
he brought me a chippped bone bracelet for my druid - so nice), we had catnaps<br/>
with a timer set ;P.  The 2 people I knew in the camp when we started soon<br/>
left, and I was left with new people to get to know.  It was one of the<br/>
strongest bonding experiences I have ever had in EQ =).<br/>
<br/>
As for bards with Jboots:  it is a fine, fine thing to click them on outside<br/>
Guk or Sol B or Kaesora and run to the bottom at speed :).  That is what I use<br/>
them for most.  I used to also use them to run at speed and invis across<br/>
Kithicor, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
Since the better non-camping Jboots quest was implemented (yes, I am being<br/>
sarcastic hehe) I know I could not justify getting a pair over my cleric<br/>
(faster travel to res me woohoo!  hehe), paladin, etc. friends.<br/>
