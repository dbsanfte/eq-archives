<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867318991">We weren&#39;t strong enough to make it to the warden, we tried twice with<br/>
fairly lehtal results.  (The first involved fighting 8 blue froggies, a<br/>
battle we should have won but the bard panicked and called Run).  The<br/>
squire is alaways camped on Veeshan (at least he has been every time I<br/>
looked).  We could have camped him after waiting a while, but then we<br/>
would have lost the sryer camp (they aren&#39;t very close).  OUr plan is to<br/>
try for squire this week.<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
