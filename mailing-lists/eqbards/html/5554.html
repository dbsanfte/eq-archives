&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all , <br/>
&gt;     Well , to put it bluntly i&#39;m bored . I am lvl 38 now , a smidge away from <br/>
&gt; 39 and i quit.  I got bored with guk , i got bored with playing , hunting or <br/>
&gt; otherwise.  I think for me , i miss open spaces, i miss places like lake <br/>
&gt; rathe , lesser fay , or steamfont . I&#39;m sick of being confined no matter what <br/>
&gt; i&#39;m doing , i mean i got to camp the undead tower in the cav room. got great <br/>
&gt; exp /loot , but for the most part i was bored. I thought and thought and <br/>
&gt; thought what had changed , why all of a sudden i was so bored. It came to me <br/>
&gt; , i can&#39;t solo effectively anywhere anymore it seems.  I like to group and <br/>
&gt; hunt , but sometimes i&#39;d like to try hunting solo  , and i&#39;ve found i can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; AT ALL , i know bards are meant to be group oriented classes , but i wish i <br/>
&gt; could kill something myself . Aww hell this turned into a rant , sorry. But i <br/>
&gt; still love this game , i miss my friends ( who have blown by me in the 2 <br/>
&gt; weeks i haven&#39;t played , guess they can smell 50 and went nuts ) and i want <br/>
&gt; to play. but where and what ? what did you high level people hunt to have fun <br/>
&gt; , i mean i get bored after like 15 minutes of being in the same spot now. I <br/>
&gt; was thinking of mistmoore , but i want a little more info first . Sorry , <br/>
&gt; someone please help me out , give me somf fun things i can do or something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lower Guk is a lot less boring if you don&#39;t camp. Treat it like a real<br/>
dungeon, and work your way in, stopping off occasionally to clear likely<br/>
special spots a few times and clear ahead of you before moving forward<br/>
to what you hope will be the next safe spot to med and heal. That&#39;s how<br/>
the party I did lower with did it. It&#39;s a lot more dangerous, but way<br/>
more fun than what I now see people doing, which is picking one<br/>
particular spawn and camping it. There is so much down there it&#39;s<br/>
amazing, but these people seem to only camp the spawns someone in the<br/>
group has been shown by someone else, where the real fun, IMO, is<br/>
exploring and finding the specials yourself. At L38 you are still a bit<br/>
weak for real deep but with 2 partys it can be done. Or you could go to<br/>
Nagafen&#39;s and pull to the door like so many do, but that is way more<br/>
boring.<br/>
<br/>
As to the lack of ability to solo, I guess we&#39;ve all confronted that at<br/>
some point. I basically dealt with it by mothballing my L49 bard and<br/>
starting a druid on the new server. I had great fun with my bard but at<br/>
this point I&#39;m tired of being totally at the mercy of the rest of the<br/>
party as to where we go and what we hunt, and tired of all the good gear<br/>
going to the melee fighters first, then people getting tired of camping<br/>
the spot before my turn comes around for a shot at it. Bards are really<br/>
in demand in high level parties for their mana pumping, but it gets old<br/>
eventually. Now most of the people I used to group with are playing<br/>
tweaked newbie chars and amusing themselves gathering top gear for them,<br/>
and always ask me to come help, but none are available to help me go try<br/>
for a Ykesha so I&#39;d rather just play my druid.<br/>
