<div id="ygrps-yiv-120398984"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;it never even crossed my mind to test it, sorry all.  i went straight to<br/>
&gt;getting the breastplate.  i am under the assumption that although all of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;items needed for the lambent armor quests are usable and have stats, they<br/>
&gt;are solely meant for these quests.  hopefully someone will do some tests<br/>
&gt;before turning it in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;as far as where it comes from, it&#39;s not the named gypsy musician, it is off<br/>
&gt;the non-named gypsy musicians.  they merely are &quot;Gypsy Musician&quot; and are in<br/>
&gt;the piano room of mistmoore castle.  if they have a lute you can see them<br/>
&gt;holding it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i didn&#39;t get reimbursed, cause in fact i was wrong, like other bards.  <br/>
&gt;makes<br/>
&gt;perfect sense though, since the lute of the gypsy princess is totally<br/>
&gt;dissimilar to all of the other quest components (off rare named npc, <br/>
&gt;neither<br/>
&gt;lore nor no drop).  so far, every component is extremely common on these<br/>
&gt;mobs.  the random number generator plays tricks sometimes.  i have gotten<br/>
&gt;the item needed on the first or second kill on many occassions (Froon,<br/>
&gt;Choon, Solusek Mage), while for a friend it has taken 5 hours (Griffenne<br/>
&gt;Charm).<br/>

Everything else was not much of a problem (still have yet to loot my own <br/>
lambent stone ).<br/>
<br/>
As far as Genni, she is also broken on Veeshan. Someone trained her to zone <br/>
or something and she got stuck and poofed or something. She is supposedly <br/>
going to be restored on Tuesday (hopefully).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck getting the rest of the armor =)<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, my friend says there seem to be slightly less wandering mobs <br/>
in PoF, but since they are still new at hunting their they get their butts <br/>
kicked regularly. He&#39;s to perseverance!<br/>
