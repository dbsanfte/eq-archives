My name is Uluvaas, Elven Bard of the 11th Song. I have just <br/>
recently joined this fine establishment. But anyway, I was looking <br/>
for some help. I need to find an easy way to get a lambent bp to <br/>
finish off my suit but dont have any available platinum. If some <br/>
could please help, i&#39;m on the Lanys Tv&#39;yl server, usually on <br/>
between 1:00 P.M. - 2:00 P.M. central time.<br/>
