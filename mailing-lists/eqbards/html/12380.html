&gt; You know now that I think back on it, I remember thinking it was weird at<br/>
&gt; the time because I got the message about becoming visible.  It could have<br/>
&gt; been some sort of glitch graphics-wise and he wasn&#39;t where he appeared to<br/>
&gt; be.  We have used Selo&#39;s in conjunction with Clouding but since we were<br/>
&gt; moving I&#39;m not sure if the other bard playing Selo&#39;s was ever spotted.<br/>
&gt; Everything I conned was indifferent though.<br/>

sneaking around because my songs blow his &quot;invisibility.&quot;  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t make him visible, but I think the way it works is that<br/>
while the song is pulsing, the mobs can see you.<br/>
