<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     So, we have an armor that is arguably the best magical armor that<br/>
&gt; can be had, for more than half of the players in EQ.  (Yes, <br/>
&gt; Mithril and<br/>
&gt; a few other pieces are better but are only wearable by a few, for<br/>
&gt; example we bards cannot wear Mithril).  And, it is only found in one<br/>
&gt; place.  And, it is a rare drop.  What this means is that there will<br/>
&gt; NEVER be enough ruby to go around.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bards can wear mithril breastplate and the bracers.  Never seen any other<br/>
pieces, haven&#39;t gone in deep enough yet.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Note: if Green Splinted Platemail (like <br/>
&gt; Aradune wears)<br/>
&gt; makes it into the game, and is wearable by those who can wear ruby and<br/>
&gt; by monks also (like it is rumored to), then green will replace ruby as<br/>
&gt; the best armor in the game, and will be camped like hell, not solving<br/>
&gt; the problem at all.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being as good as it is, it is going to be on something over level 50,<br/>
requiring at least 2 full groups of level 45-50 players, maybe more, and it<br/>
is hard to coordinate that kind of camp.  i have a tough time getting a<br/>
ghoul lord group together until late at night, which takes 6 to 12 people to<br/>
be safe, and have yet to go and find it already camped.<br/>
