<br/>
The formula is simple. First of all, a weapon has a maximum amount of<br/>
damage it can do in a single hit. This amount is (DMG * 2) + 1. Why? It<br/>
just does . . . observe your weapon&#39;s behavior. Your Mino Axe should do no<br/>
more than 17 damage (8 * 2) +1.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, you won&#39;t always do the maximum amount of damage. <br/>
<br/>
Your STR helps determine how close to the max you hit. The higher your STR,<br/>
the more chance you&#39;ll have of hitting for the max. Your skill in the<br/>
weapon and in offense probably affects this as well.<br/>
<br/>
Also, your opponent&#39;s armor will affact how much damage you hit for,<br/>
because their armor will absorb some of your damage. You will notice you do<br/>
less damage against higher level characters even when you hit them.<br/>
<br/>
So my formula takes the max amount of damage (DMG * 2) + 1 . . . and<br/>
divides it by the delay of a weapon in seconds (Delay / 10). Doing this you<br/>
get damage per second, which is probably better named maximum damage per<br/>
second.<br/>

&gt;Question about your formula for dps... And maybe it&#39;s a question about<br/>
&gt;damage in general...  : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(damage*2)+1   Where&#39;d you get the *2?  Doesn&#39;t STR get factored in there<br/>
&gt;somewhere?  I am extremelly curious about this as I am probably over<br/>
&gt;obsessive about Stats.  : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If someone could break down how my Mino Axe with a damage of 8 does 18 max<br/>
&gt;damage for me, I&#39;d appreciate it. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a base strength of 95, going as high as 112 with buffs and equip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I sorted through the list of weapons on EQLizer for magic 1H slashing<br/>
&gt;&gt;weapons.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The obvious ones are the combine longsword and scimtar, and their<br/>
&gt;&gt;well-balanced counterparts. Information on these is widely held, so I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;go into detail here.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; First, let me say I measure the damage value of a weapon using a stat<br/>
&gt;&gt;called damage per second (dps). This is calculated assuming that the delay<br/>
&gt;&gt;is in tenths of a sec (I think that&#39;s about right). To calculate: ( (damage<br/>
&gt;&gt;* 2) + 1 ) / (delay / 10)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Please give me any info you have on any of these weapons, including<br/>
&gt;&gt;opinons on which is best, how hard they to obtain, how much they sell for<br/>
&gt;&gt;if sold, etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Also, if there are any missng from this list please add them. (There are<br/>
&gt;&gt;only 4 here). And two of those are not even confirmed as 1H slashing magic<br/>
&gt;&gt;weapons.  If they are not magic and 1H slashing then I am very much hoping<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am missing some good ones from this list.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Barbed Whip<br/>
&gt;&gt;Damage 7 / Delay 28 = 5.35 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;Found on the Bonrcrusher in Najena<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>
&gt;&gt;Damage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;Casts berserker strnegth occasionally, but I don&#39;t know what this is.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Have no idea where it is found.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Crystalline Sword<br/>
&gt;&gt;Damage 11 / Delay 38 = 6.05 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t even know if this is magical, but I have a feeling it is<br/>
&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t have any idea where to find it<br/>
&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t even know if it is 1H Slashing<br/>
&gt;&gt;Please help on this one, I like the stats!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Cerrated Bone Dirk<br/>
&gt;&gt;Damage 9 / Delay Delay 26 = 7.3 dps!<br/>
&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t know if it is 1H slashing<br/>
&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t know if it magic<br/>
&gt;&gt;I do know it is found on the Froglock Assasin in Guk Bottom<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Just for comparison:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Mino Axe<br/>
&gt;&gt;Damage 8 / Delay 37 = 4.59 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Dwarven Axe<br/>
&gt;&gt;Damage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
