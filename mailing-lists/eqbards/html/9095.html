While I cant give you specific tips on where in Guk to use AE songs or not<br/>
here are some observations of mine about AE songs in general.<br/>
<br/>
Do use them if you are in a heavily camped spot.  Unrest barroom and knight<br/>
room is also camped.  Even if you hit the other mobs - if they are camped,<br/>
you wont pull them.<br/>
<br/>
Do not use them if you are on train tracks or have lots of wandering mobs.<br/>
Unrest yard and lots of death beetle traffic.  Also beware of z-axis &quot;bugs&quot;<br/>
- Aviac treehouse - if you use ae in top floor of tree house - birds on the<br/>
ground will attack you.  If you use them underneath the trees, you will pull<br/>
all the birds out of the trees above you.<br/>
<br/>
Do use them when you need them!  For a long time I was scared of them for<br/>
fear of pulling too many mobs.  But sometimes you just gotta use what you<br/>
have.  A few too many kobalds last night and I played lullaby with a lute.<br/>
We managed to survive.  When it got down to 3 doggies, I switched to<br/>
mezmerise.  But with multiple mobs, you gotta use multi-mob crowd control.<br/>

		Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
		    I have a question on good places/bad places for AE<br/>
songs... last night<br/>
		my guild was spelunking around in upper guk ruining our<br/>
factor and we ran<br/>
		into multiple spawns in numerous locations (this was our<br/>
first time there as<br/>
		a group, and on Nameless it rocked to see 7 people total in<br/>
the zone, 6 of<br/>
		whom comprised my group) - ideal places to use AE songs,<br/>
however I&#39;ve read<br/>
		horror stories... so I wimped out and didn&#39;t use them.<br/>
<br/>
		    So which parts of guk are okay places and which are<br/>
begging for that oh<br/>
		so familiar &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&quot; screen to pop up? :)<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks!<br/>
