&gt;&gt; Conventional tactics in EQ when you pull multiple mobs is for everyone to<br/>
&gt;&gt; /assist the main tank and take out the mobs one by one.  This stategy behind<br/>
&gt;&gt; this is that it will reduce the amount of damage inflicted on the entire<br/>
&gt;&gt; party.  I think it would be safe for me to say that almost every group I<br/>
&gt;&gt; join follows this tactic when we fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It cuts the damage roughly in half.  The exact amount depends<br/>
&gt;on the number of mobs (assuming the amount of hp a typical mob<br/>
&gt;has is comparable to the damage it does - there are several<br/>
&gt;exceptions to this, thus the rule kill the caster first).<br/>
&gt;For 2 mobs it&#39;s 75%, for 3 mobs it&#39;s 67%, decreasing<br/>
&gt;asymptotically until you get to 50% for infinite mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; to bear the brunt of the damage from the mobs that aren&#39;t engaged.  This<br/>
&gt;&gt; tactic also puts the groups healer at risk because unengaged mobs are likely<br/>
&gt;&gt; to attack him as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah, you usually won&#39;t get much sympathy from group members<br/>
&gt;if you complain about the extra mobs attacking you.  You have<br/>
&gt;to mention that when the healer heals you, the extras will be<br/>
&gt;all over *their* healer.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I wondering that if in situations where you get 2+ mobs, that it might<br/>
&gt;&gt; actually be smarter if the tanks in the group each attacked a different mob.<br/>
&gt;&gt; It would take longer to kill all the mobs, but it would help ensure that<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage to the group was spread out better.  Plus, if all the mobs are<br/>
&gt;&gt; engaged, it would be safer for bards to sing Largos to debuff mob attack<br/>
&gt;&gt; speed.  Its quite possible that the damage multiple mobs inflict using this<br/>
&gt;&gt; tactic (Largos in effect all the time) would be very close to the damage<br/>
&gt;&gt; they inflict when everyone focuses on one at a time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, if everyone is assisting and the extra mob is going to<br/>
&gt;beat up on the bard anyways, you might as well play Largo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;:)  So I don&#39;t see Largo&#39;s as having any effect on the<br/>
&gt;comparison.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The real unknown in this is how much better is a real tank at<br/>
&gt;tanking than a bard.  If a real tank can take 75% the damage<br/>
&gt;of a bard or less, then it makes more sense to fight both at<br/>
&gt;once.  That&#39;s for evenly splitting your resources though.<br/>
&gt;The best strategy would be one tank on the extra, everyone<br/>
&gt;else fights the primary target.  The exact percentage would<br/>
&gt;vary depending on group size and composition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well if you have a REAL tank (Warrior) and a good one that is, he/she will keep<br/>
any extras taunted and is able to take a lot more damage than you. I think it<br/>
works very well when warriors taunts the extras onto himself. This offcourse<br/>
only applies when the tanks can take the beating from the extras, and youre not<br/>
using AE damage songs.. As for engaging several mobs.  I only think this is the<br/>
way to go when one starts beating on your caster and even then people should<br/>
switch back to the main target when the mob is taunted of the finger wiggler (or<br/>
bard). Tanks is able to take massive amounts of hits. It truely amazes me how<br/>
thick their skulls are :o)<br/>
My strategi in multipulls is to keep an eye out for our casters and either pixie<br/>
or charm any extras. Remember NEVER assist the bard ;o)<br/>

P.S How much would people say a fair price for a MM drum is? And what are my<br/>
chances at my current level of getting one myself in MM?<br/>
