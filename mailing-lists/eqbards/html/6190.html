<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104996307">You can do /log and the fe will keep a log of all the text messages.  Then<br/>
after you game, run one of the eq parsers that player have developed - it<br/>
will build a db of your stats and performance.  Check for dl&#39;s on eq vault<br/>
and such.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the meat of the question:<br/>
<br/>
It will depend on the make up of your party.  If I get into groups where<br/>
there are tanks and the group is killing high reds (but not too high such<br/>
that I don&#39;t get any xp), then my ability to damage - even with good weps is<br/>
so small that I opt to buff the party with songs that will help them more<br/>
than make up for hits for 2 and hits for 4 (would be my contributions when I<br/>
am not missing 3 and 4 times in a row).<br/>
<br/>
If I am as good or better at melee than those I am grouped with - then I<br/>
have to be the Battle Bard.  And then creative chicken-ology comes into the<br/>
equation.  That&#39;s knowing when and how to let the other take their share of<br/>
the total damage that will be dished out.  You will need to start and stop<br/>
songs - stop your melee attack - stand and take a couple rounds while the<br/>
others taunt and build hate - step back and scrape the mobs onto your<br/>
partners - equip lute and heal in combat (esp heal your self back up) then<br/>
dive back in and taunt the mob with songs to pull it off the others, etc<br/>
etc. rinse, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Just my ho,<br/>

		I fully expect that one of the subtleties of the Bard class<br/>
is that as you<br/>
		mature into the role of Bard that your songs will, over<br/>
time, start to do more<br/>
		damage than your weapons when instruments are equipped.</div>
