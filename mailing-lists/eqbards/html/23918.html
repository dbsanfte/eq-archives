<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962458860">If you have a Selos Drum, this song adds a very nice chunk of AC - like 34<br/>
iirc.<br/>
<br/>
Any druids, wizards, clerics, ragners, heck anyone not interested in a free<br/>
dose of 34 AC?  <br/>
<br/>
I liked it alot - I was using the 3 chants (percussion) so it was quite nice<br/>
to fire this song up - at least for the incoming pull and give everyone +34<br/>
AC without swapping weps or instruments. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is this &#39;you feel small...&#39; message?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;+34 AC - look at your stats&quot;<br/>

Does this song have any use?  It seems prety pointless to me because since<br/>
you will lose the effects as soon as you get hit.  Or am I missing<br/>
something?<br/>
<br/>
Is there only one lvl 52 song?<br/>
