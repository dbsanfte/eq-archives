good items can only be attained by camping.  If you try to<br/>
play by wandering and exploring, you&#39;re going to get mostly<br/>
crap for loot, even from the named mobs.<br/>

By the way, when a druid, necro, or shaman tries to steal<br/>
something from you, make sure you hit the mob with cancel<br/>
magic (or use a pumice stone) to get rid of their DoT.  My<br/>
friends and I had a druid steal the froglok shin lord from us<br/>
while we were trying to get Ghoulbane for our paladin.  I<br/>
discovered that although charm clears the damage list, if a<br/>
DoT is in effect throughout the charm, the stealer still gets<br/>
credit for damage done by that DoT.<br/>
