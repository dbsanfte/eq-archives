<div id="ygrps-yiv-322529867">i don&#39;t know your email address, but i saw this on the concert hall board.<br/>
more laughs from Moshkiae regarding someone who asked whether they should<br/>
trade for a selo&#39;s drum they were offerred:<br/>
<br/>
I think a comparative discussion is in order ... <br/>
1. When, will anyone in his right mind be using a Drum in killing dragons?<br/>
When he/she wants to die first!<br/>
2. How much better is this drum? Ohh, 5% only. That means that you can go<br/>
from Qeynos to Freeport in 19 minutes instead of 21. Ohh hell, you are<br/>
faster!<br/>
3. The piece you are wearing and trading. How hard/easy is it to replace it?<br/>
Is it affecting your AC and stats? Will they drop severely? Can you get that<br/>
LambaSingDooDah piece to replace it easily enough, so you don&#39;t lose much<br/>
... <br/>
4. Are the animations in this new drum different? Does it look cool when you<br/>
have it, and make you want to be a member of Osibisa? Ohhh darn, the store<br/>
bough one for 4 gp&#39;s looks just like it.<br/>
I don&#39;t know. Ask me when I get there, but I doubt it, unless the game has<br/>
changed and these instruments DO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ... aren&#39;t things CAP&#39;d<br/>
anyway with limits for all buffs and debuffs?<br/>

1. hmm, every time if you are a bard.<br/>
2. hmm, 30% or more.<br/>
3. what?<br/>
4. sigh.<br/>
seems he has left EQ-Bards to riddle the concert hall with his<br/>
misinformation campaign.<br/>
