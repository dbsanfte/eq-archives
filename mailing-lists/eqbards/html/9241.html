<b>Subject:</b> Highkeep basement (was What to solo at level 27) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-846166882">I went to the first level of the Highkeep basement for the first time at 24th<br/>
level.  Also went back at 25th level.  Due to living in Hawaii and generally<br/>
playing late at night, its usually not that crowded when I have been there.  One<br/>
or two groups at most.  Despite this, it seemed there was a very long downtime<br/>
in between spawns.  I think there are five spawn points on the first level where<br/>
pickclaws will appear.  Two in the room off to the side.  One by the door<br/>
leading to that room.  One in a corner further down from the doorway.  Last one<br/>
on the other side of the room in a corner.  There may be more but I know there<br/>
are at least five.  Even though the pickclaws gave good experience, I was bored<br/>
due to all the downtime.  Didn&#39;t actually time it but I would guess the spawn<br/>
rate is around 10 minutes for each spawn point.  Is the spawn rate faster<br/>
further down in the basement?  Are there more things to fight in the basement<br/>
than on the first level?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; Doh! I relized that right after I sent it, LOL.  But the basement is still a <br/>
&gt; good spot as I never had to wait more then 30 mins to get into a group that <br/>
&gt; would last for the rest of the night.  It is a great place for casual <br/>
&gt; grouping, and it is nearly impossible to die there :)<br/>
