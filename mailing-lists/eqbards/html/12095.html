<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764696787">More evidence that &quot;bard hate&quot; is alive and well - unfortunately it&#39;s the<br/>
game designers and not monsters:<br/>
<br/>
[clipped off www.eqvault.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqvault.com">http://www.eqvault.com</a>&gt;  where Gordon<br/>
(Verant&#39;s internet P/R person) was answering questions about druid tracking<br/>
skill being raised]<br/>
<br/>
Well we definatly wouldn&#39;t want to increase the cap to a level above bards,<br/>
as to do so would devalue the ranger. The bard cap, to be honest, is set too<br/>
high, but we&#39;ll just live with that. <br/>
Please keep the comments coming. <br/>

I am beginning to wonder if _anyone_ at Verant has played chars thru level<br/>
50 - start to finish like regular players do?  From what perspective are<br/>
they getting these _endless_ visions of &quot;class balancing&quot; needs.  And ya, ya<br/>
- I wonder if _any_ of them ever play a normal bard - I dare anyone of them<br/>
to level a bard to 35.  Much less test that new or changed spell/song on the<br/>
bats in North Qeynos/G&#39;Fay/West Freep.<br/>

p.s. really looking forward to level 40 - woo hoo Picklocks!!! Already have<br/>
my gnome fiend making me a set of Gnomish Lockpicks.  And when I get<br/>
them.... LOOKOUT Befallen HERE I COME!!!!  Woo hoo a level 40 skill in a<br/>
level 20 dungeon!!!  /auction BBC 10pp or best offer - gimme a tell if you<br/>
want a sword that lowers your stats!!</div>
