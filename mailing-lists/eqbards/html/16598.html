<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214586574">Ack!  I got this in just as I mailed out my idea on a tp song (gathers group<br/>
from anywhere in the game, EXCEPT the zone you&#39;re in)... lemme see if I can<br/>
pretty it up.<br/>
<br/>
Bardo&#39;s Symphonic Gathering<br/>
Instrument needed: Flute (especially so you don&#39;t sing it accidentally<br/>
o)~  )<br/>
Range:  All zones but the one the singer is in.<br/>
    While not being a FULL teleport song, it would clearly add to a bard&#39;s<br/>
usefulness without unbalanceing the class or a group.  A member drop from<br/>
your group?  No big deal, send out your group leader to invite someone else<br/>
to the group, then bring them back with this song.  With the same-zone<br/>
limitation, there is no chance of PoS abuse or threat of creating a train.<br/>
Included would be a message box with yes or no answers similar to the ones<br/>
that pop up on a rez.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] UPDATE 2 - we&#39;re getting there!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From: Tork &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tdomeii@...">tdomeii@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On to a compendium of ideas.  I am not making any judgements on them, but<br/>
&gt;I did take the liberty of combining similar ideas and/or taking the most<br/>
&gt;well written version of an idea and posting that.  I will attribute all<br/>
&gt;song ideas to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqbards@onelist.com">eqbards@onelist.com</a> unless you explicitly email me<br/>
&gt;(privately if you want, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gww6e@...">gww6e@...</a>) to say otherwise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My comments are marked with a *.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. Party Bind<br/>
&gt;We did not want a bind song if it was identical to casters, however if the<br/>
&gt;song allowed you to bind anyone anyplace (melees included) then with spell<br/>
&gt;reagent costs and mana tolls, we would certainly welcome it, especially at<br/>
&gt;higher (51+) levels since expansion zones are rumored to be mammoth in<br/>
&gt;scale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2. Upgrade to Clouding (was: Party invis vs undead)<br/>
&gt;An upgrade to Clouding that combined invis, invis vs undead and sneak<br/>
&gt;(meaning no spell graphic) since this would give us an ability no single<br/>
&gt;caster can provide (both invis types) and the no spell graphic would be a<br/>
&gt;boon to +PvP servers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3. Upgraded charm.  Everyone and his brother (over 35 responses) wanted<br/>
&gt;this and hey, I do too. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4. Upgrade to clouding.  Nuff said, and I think I summed it up that we&#39;d<br/>
&gt;like a song that can provide both types of invis.<br/>
&gt;*duplicated and deprecated by 2, I┬Æm going to remove it. -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5. An improved damage shield.  This appears to be drawing interest:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Denon&#39;s Sonic Reflection<br/>
&gt;Brass<br/>
&gt;Gives all party members a damage reflection shield.  Causing a portion of<br/>
&gt;the damage done to them in combat (melee & non-melee) to be reflected back<br/>
&gt;at the attacker).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6. An improved AE DoT with added effect (stamina drain being a common<br/>
&gt;thread, the other was a lifetap affect).  Question at large: do mobs have<br/>
&gt;stamina and if so, does it impact their ability to fight?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*More work is needed here. -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;7. Upgrade to selo&#39;s OR remove hard speed cap.<br/>
&gt;*I personally want the cap removed vice burning another spell slot on an<br/>
&gt;upgrade. -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;8. Upgrade to clarity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cassandra&#39;s Clarified Elegy<br/>
&gt;Provides clarity2 (whatever that might be) + (limited?) elegy effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*Is this warranted? -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;9. Upgrade to MR debuffing abilities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Denon&#39;s Fog of War. AE snare. AE slow attack speed. AE Dot. AE magic<br/>
&gt;debuff (30 pts at least). effect of fog?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*I like where this is going, anyone want to help fill in the blanks? -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;10. One-way teleport (self only?  to bard guild?).<br/>
&gt;*superseded by Call to Arms, number 17.  I will remove this unless there<br/>
&gt;is debate otherwise. ┬ûTork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;11. Mem blur song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fitful&#39;s Forgetful Improv<br/>
&gt;Voice<br/>
&gt;Causes the target to become so fixated on the improv that it forgets<br/>
&gt;whatever else it was dong.  Drawback: Bard possibly left on hate list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*No further discussion on this?  Given how powerful mobs are going to be,<br/>
&gt;perhaps make it AE and not break mez? -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;12. Upgraded Atk Song<br/>
&gt;Since we are out speed buffed by enchanters, a straight addition to Atk<br/>
&gt;with an added component.  Most commonly heard suggestion: rune type<br/>
&gt;shielding.  Other suggestions: massive ac bonus, massive regeneration<br/>
&gt;effect, massive MR buff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*Definitely more ideas needed here.  We all know we need and deserve a<br/>
&gt;song like this and we all know we┬Ære gonna get some VoV upgrade.  Let┬Æs<br/>
&gt;help steer GZ and company in the right direction. -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;13. A proc song<br/>
&gt;The Chromatic Scale<br/>
&gt;Level: 36th<br/>
&gt;Skill: Singing<br/>
&gt;Description: A chromatic scale is all the notes an instrument is capable<br/>
&gt;of producing, generally played starting from the lowest to the highest and<br/>
&gt;then back down; slurred up (ligato), tongued down (staccato).  The<br/>
&gt;Chromatic Scale when song by the bard would act much as the Vampiric<br/>
&gt;Embrace necro spell in that it imparts a proc to melee attacks however the<br/>
&gt;twist is that there would be 5 different types which randomly kick off:<br/>
&gt;magic, fire, cold, disease and poison based attacks. These would be DD&#39;s -<br/>
&gt;there by filling in our missing DD ability, but in a uniquely bard fashion<br/>
&gt;(group based, becomes more powerful as you add members and err... randomly<br/>
&gt;good -- maybe. hehe).  Verant of course would come up with some cute<br/>
&gt;little chromatic sparkles to surround us and multi colored blasts as the<br/>
&gt;proc goes off. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;14. A bard additive song<br/>
&gt;Cinda&#39;s Companion Cantata<br/>
&gt;Level: 49th+<br/>
&gt;Skill: Variable (see below)<br/>
&gt;Description: A cantata is a composition scored for many parts at once,<br/>
&gt;incorporating both voice and instrumental accompaniment, hence this song<br/>
&gt;would allow bards in the same group to ally their voices in song to<br/>
&gt;intensify the effects of a common song ┬û to &quot;stack&quot; the same song, perhaps<br/>
&gt;with at 100*(2-((6-n)^(1/6)))% effectiveness, where n is the number of<br/>
&gt;bards playing cantata. Yes, this could be exceptionally powerful, what<br/>
&gt;with twisting and all, but this could easily be limited to only effect the<br/>
&gt;&quot;top&quot; bard song in the spell list of the lead singer, whilst the<br/>
&gt;&quot;recovery&quot; period of stopping the song would be such that twisting<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be possible if you were a cantata player.<br/>
&gt;Example: A group composed of 1 warrior and 2 bards stops to rest. Bard 1<br/>
&gt;begins to sing Hymn, only to be joined in song by bard 2 with Cinda&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Cantata - boosting regeneration by their now intensity music (by the SWAG<br/>
&gt;formula above that would be a +69%).<br/>
&gt;Full stacking numbers would be:<br/>
&gt;n    +%<br/>
&gt;--------<br/>
&gt;1    69<br/>
&gt;2    74<br/>
&gt;3    80<br/>
&gt;4    88<br/>
&gt;5    100<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*Anyone got any better ideas? -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;15. Song of Silence<br/>
&gt;Solon&#39;s Song of Silence<br/>
&gt;Effect: NON-PARTY: Silence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PBAE, fixed radius, 2 tick negate casting.  NPC has one chance to resist<br/>
&gt;intial and to break free<br/>
&gt;each tick there after. Lute for enhanced effects. Save versus Magic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*I love this idea personally, anyone care to add more?  I want to flesh it<br/>
&gt;out and will take action if no one objects. -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;16. Serious upgrade to healing. (NB:  of all the issues brough up, this<br/>
&gt;needs the most serious analysis btw.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*Hopefully I┬Æm on the right path with that I have now, but please correct<br/>
&gt;me if I┬Æm wrong. -Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Currently at 50th with a store bought lute:<br/>
&gt;Niv┬Æs=15 hp/tick<br/>
&gt;Hymn=17 hp/tick<br/>
&gt;Total=roughly 30hp/tick<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Typical mobs encountered at that level hit in low 100┬Æs, double hit 100%<br/>
&gt;of the time and have an approximate delay of 25.  As a damage per second<br/>
&gt;figure, that approaches 80 damage/second, 3 seconds/tick, 240 damage/tick.<br/>
&gt; Regeneration factor: 12.5%.<br/>
&gt;Scaling to 60th,<br/>
&gt;Niv┬Æs=22 hp/tick<br/>
&gt;Hymn=22 hp/tick<br/>
&gt;Total=roughly 44 hp/tick<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To maintain this balance, a typical L60 encounter mob can have a damage<br/>
&gt;per second output of 352, 117 damage/sec, or assuming a similar delay of<br/>
&gt;25 and double hitting 100% of the time, a per blow damage of 146.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We know this not to be the case as plane of sky ┬ôyard trash┬ö easily<br/>
&gt;eclipses this figure.  Therefore, we are in need of an upgrade to healing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;17. Melanie┬Æs Call to Arms<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*I removed the nix hate list bit as per some very valid points brought up.<br/>
&gt;-Tork<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Trying to come up with a song that is<br/>
&gt;1) extremely powerful<br/>
&gt;2) no other class has<br/>
&gt;3) makes bards extremely wanted on raids (a la enchanters)<br/>
&gt;4) and has coding already built into the game<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I came up with a song that is the opposite of Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous<br/>
&gt;Motion. A song that teleports all party members in the zone to the bards<br/>
&gt;location.<br/>
&gt;Name: Melanie&#39;s Call to Arms<br/>
&gt;This song would be extremely useful in conjunction with a binding group<br/>
&gt;leader. Imagine doing an Efreeti Raid in SolB and wanting to bring in<br/>
&gt;other members since some need to leave. Instead of breaking through again<br/>
&gt;the group leader would be bound at zoneline, group up the bard and gate<br/>
&gt;back to his bindpoint. The group leader would then group up the 4 new<br/>
&gt;members and the song would be sung and would teleport everyone back to the<br/>
&gt;bard. There are a few problems with this that may make it too powerful.<br/>
&gt;Such as Plane of Sky (never been myself) where this song could not be used<br/>
&gt;to bypass the teleporters etc  This song combined with Selo&#39;s would make<br/>
&gt;the bard extremely wanted in any group, but especially raids. The song may<br/>
&gt;need to use up mana, although I really don&#39;t want all our songs using up<br/>
&gt;mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;18. Group damage dispersion/distribution<br/>
&gt;Name: Song of Solidarity *New name suggestions anyone? -Tork<br/>
&gt;Function: Whenever a member of the party takes damage, that damage it<br/>
&gt;distributed among the party members.<br/>
&gt;For example, a 5 person party: The warrior gets hit for 75 (make this<br/>
&gt;simple *Smiles*) points of damage. The warrior actually gets hit for 15<br/>
&gt;points, and all other party members get hit for 15 points of non-melee<br/>
&gt;damage. Very hard to code (probably a lot of logic changes,) but something<br/>
&gt;different which would augment the Bard&#39;s ability to lessen party downtime.<br/>
&gt;(Maybe.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;19. On mana regeneration and putting ┬ôno mana┬ö into perspective, by John<br/>
&gt;H. Kim ;)<br/>
&gt;Just to clarify what it means to &quot;buff without exceeding your mana regen<br/>
&gt;rate...&quot;<br/>
&gt;Say each buff costs you one bubble. Say each buff lasts 60 minutes. Say<br/>
&gt;you meditate back one bubble a minute. That means you can keep a maximum<br/>
&gt;of 60 buffs up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How many buffs you can cast going from FM to OOM is pretty irrelevant<br/>
&gt;since buffing is almost always done during downtime. What matters is how<br/>
&gt;many buffs your mana regeneration rate allows you to maintain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is the type of analysis Verant failed to do (and is failing to do)<br/>
&gt;every time they go off on one of their &quot;but bards use no mana!&quot; tangents.<br/>
&gt;No we don&#39;t use mana, but because of the short lifespan of our songs and<br/>
&gt;the (relatively) long &quot;casting time&quot; for our songs, it&#39;s pretty much the<br/>
&gt;same thing as using mana. In fact, you can think of our songs as spells<br/>
&gt;that last 12 seconds, require 5 bubbles of mana to cast, and our mana<br/>
&gt;regen rate gives us back 5 bubbles every 3 seconds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;20. Upgraded mez capabilities.<br/>
&gt;*I┬Æm at a loss here, given that our existing mez song is hopelessly broken<br/>
&gt;how can I hope for an upgraded one?  At any rate, ideas and suggestions or<br/>
&gt;just some one logically and polietly stating the facts surrounding Lullaby<br/>
&gt;would be very helpful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;21. What┬Æd I forget? :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*Okay, this format looks like crap, but comments none the less.  I will<br/>
&gt;reformat tonight and get it in a revision 0 status for release tomorrow to<br/>
&gt;the list.  Man, this is been a lot of work, but I mean that in the best<br/>
&gt;possible way!  Hopefully by Thursday morning we can have it polished up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
