<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507649190">Yes I have been having some weird experiences with mobs and water.  Ran<br/>
after them raiders and killed them in the water. But then was down in Lake<br/>
Rathe and thought hmmm... wonder if I can kill that birdie standing on that<br/>
pier (I was in a small boat.)  So I bellow at him and the birdie hops into<br/>
the water.  Then I beller some more and get a message &quot;a aviak hits a aviak<br/>
for 32000 points of damage&quot; followed by &quot;a aviak has slain a aviak&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I fell out of the boat!  Anyway to climb back in?  I tried for a long<br/>
time with no luck.<br/>
