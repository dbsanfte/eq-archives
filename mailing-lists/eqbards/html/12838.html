<div id="ygrps-yiv-685375152"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; .......Invis to Undead, although a bit late I think it would be useful esp<br/>
&gt; in places like L Guk, Unrest, Kith Forest etc.<br/>
&gt; A simple song to fill in a missing gap.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I had sent that in as a suggestion several months ago via the<br/>
  /feedback command.  It would really waste a song slot for something<br/>
  much more useful on a widespread level.  But there are times when<br/>
  I get tired of begging people for an invis at the deadside zone of<br/>
  lguk.<br/>
<br/>
  Until recently, I just realized /feedback is just a link to the<br/>
  /ignore command.  Because that&#39;s what the summarily do with your<br/>
  suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
  When is our L47 song comming?  Sheesh, they must be really testing<br/>
  the crap out of it. &lt;sarcasm sarcasm sarcasm&gt;<br/>
