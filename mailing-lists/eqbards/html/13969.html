 </span></blockquote>I think the problem is much worse in reverse, though.  Because there are <br/>
a lot of high level people with nothing to do, they trickle down into <br/>
zones that they were supposed to have outgrown.  Since they are massively <br/>
overpowered in comparison the the MOBs in these zones, I often see them <br/>
running around mowing down every MOB in sight.  This is lots of fun, I <br/>
suppose, for the soloing level 45-50s, but it bleeds a lot of <br/>
experience-giving stuff out of the zone for all the people for whom the <br/>
zone was intended.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point:  I&#39;m in a group of six in West Commons fighting Dervishes <br/>
with my level 15 Warrior.  We&#39;ve just finished clearing and getting the <br/>
spawn slightly staggered when a level 40 something comes in and kills the <br/>
next three.  I can&#39;t imagine for what reason other than sheer boredom.  <br/>
They have crappy loot, no exp, and do not help in any quest.  In the <br/>
meantime, that&#39;s three spawns we didn&#39;t get.  Because it was so <br/>
pointless, this is the most flagrant recent example, but I&#39;ve had similar <br/>
experiences in High Hold, High Keep, Sol A, Ro, Oasis, West and East <br/>
Commons, ...  oh, forget it.  Suffice it to say, in every zone I&#39;ve <br/>
played in over the last two months.<br/>
<br/>
You leveled at about the same rate as my friends did, and after asking <br/>
them to come visit me in many of the zones that they told me were swell <br/>
for getting experience, they were universally glad that they managed to <br/>
beat the crowding curve.  It may have been bad when you were coming up, <br/>
but it&#39;s worse now.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I actually agree with you, though.  The problem stems from a <br/>
lack of stuff for high level players to do, which ought to be Verant&#39;s <br/>
first priority.<br/>
