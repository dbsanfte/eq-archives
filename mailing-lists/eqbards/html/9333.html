<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841601632">The reason I think it is broken is:<br/>
<br/>
1)  I have used it on several occasions when I had a DOT on me and never had<br/>
it remove the DOT.  I got the message that the song was in effect but the<br/>
DOT icon still remained on the screen and I still took damage.<br/>
<br/>
2)  The general consensus of everyone on this list is that the song is<br/>
broken.  The issue was even included in the letter that got sent to GZ.<br/>
<br/>
Are you certain that your friend&#39;s DOT didn&#39;t just wear off on its own?<br/>

&gt; Why do you think it&#39;s broken?  I used it just the other day to remove<br/>
&gt; DoT&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; It removes some things but not all things. I had to equip a string intru<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; designate a target to play it on.  But he told me his DoT dropped right as<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; played the song.<br/>

&gt; 		I hope when he reaches 22d level he will also realize that<br/>
&gt; Disenchanting<br/>
&gt; 		Melody is broken.     <br/>
