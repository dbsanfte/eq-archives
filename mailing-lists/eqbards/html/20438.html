<div id="ygrps-yiv-507951760">Lake of Ill Omens contains plentiful mobs in all levels from level 3-4 thru<br/>
27-29.  You just have to hunt in different regions.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that mobs for your level would be just to the right of where the<br/>
river hits the lake.  If you continue back in that direction you will be in<br/>
the Iksar newbie zone and have to keep your eyes open for the Iksar guards.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you tried the Lake of Ill Omen yet?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I peeked in there last night, everything was red and yellow, I decided it<br/>
would be best to go back after a few levels.<br/>
<br/>
 As I ran, with one mob behind me and one still fighting <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my husband (who was doing fine with the one) I remembered some <br/>
&gt; discussions about crowd control and running circles with mobs in <br/>
&gt; tow.  So I made sure I had my mandolin equipped and made a wide turn <br/>
&gt; back while healing myself.  Once the battle was done I deposited the <br/>
&gt; extra mob back where we were originally fighting and we finished him <br/>
&gt; off.  So much better getting exp on the 2 mobs than zoning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Heal Kiting&quot; rocks :o) I used it all the time on the south shore of Eask<br/>
karana against Gnoll Reavers. Without SoW it goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
Selos, autorun<br/>
Arm drum to get distance<br/>
switch to lute<br/>
alternate selos and hymn<br/>
<br/>
keep them close enough to keep chasing you, I *think* their healing rate is<br/>
the combat one when chasing not the faster non-combat rate.<br/>
