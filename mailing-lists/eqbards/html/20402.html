We don&#39;t have many brass songs but this one is one of them.  Unless you&#39;ve<br/>
been using DDD/CoD/Hymn with instruments a lot your brass skill is probably<br/>
pretty pathetic.  Get your brass skill maxed.  Go sit in the tunnel in EC or<br/>
somewhere else where it&#39;s safe from wandering mobs, equip your horn and turn<br/>
on this song then walk away for several hours.  When you come back you<br/>
should have a much higher brass skill and can sing this sucker reliably<br/>
(that&#39;s not to say you&#39;ll get it to stick)<br/>
<br/>
I also found that this is only really a reliable song against blues.  Whites<br/>
resist it a LOT and so do yellows.  Using a horn seems to bring a bit fewer<br/>
resits (but it&#39;s entirely possible that&#39;s just perception) and having a high<br/>
charisma REALLY helps with this (as with all &quot;mind affecting&quot; songs) song.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!!<br/>

&gt; Is it really called the fear song because you get into a panic trying to<br/>
&gt; make it stick????  Any clues on how to better use this?  Yes, I&#39;m sure<br/>
we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; covered it umpteen times but ok yeah, I had my head up my butt :)  I&#39;m<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; 26, so its still new and I expect some misses but I counted 27 in a ROW<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; morning!!! EEEEEP!<br/>
