a while back (late 30s probably, maybe low 40s), I got about a 25% resist<br/>
rate, maybe a bit less, with all my gear on.  I died, and two necros<br/>
escorted me back to my corpse.  My job was to chain frogs to keep them<br/>
from running, and I got near 80% resist the whole way in.<br/>

That incident sold me on the value of charisma.  My current unbuffed is<br/>
157, and I&#39;m looking into getting the cha stat bracers made for when it<br/>
counts.<br/>
