<div id="ygrps-yiv-551729503">Hello!<br/>
    I&#39;m mostly just a lurker on this list because I usually get it while at<br/>
work and don&#39;t have time to post.  Normally, on the weekend, I&#39;d rather play<br/>
EQ than read about it. ;)  But today, I had to do something. I&#39;ve just made<br/>
a post to our Bard Thread on the Everquest message boards. We&#39;re up to nine<br/>
pages of mostly well written posts.  And still Verant doesn&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
    I love playing my bard. And I hate to see all the effort that has been<br/>
put into this class by skilled and intelligent people like Kaeria, Rokenn,<br/>
Talies, Shada, and many other less accomplished but equally experienced<br/>
people go to waste.  I have 7 other characters that I can play but my<br/>
favorite character of all is my weak, underappreciated, struggling bard that<br/>
can occasionally tip the scales in the favor of life rather than death for<br/>
my groups. I want all the problems that have been created by Verant to be<br/>
fixed.  I want someone working at Verant to understand the core ability of<br/>
our class - our songs - the way so many players do. And I don&#39;t know how to<br/>
make that happen.<br/>
<br/>
    If anyone on this list has any ideas how we can get Verant to<br/>
acknowledge and address the problems with our great class, *please* tell me<br/>
what I can do and how I can help. The only avenue available seems to me to<br/>
be the message boards.  Please post something. Even if it has been repeated<br/>
again (and again and again) in many different ways by many different people,<br/>
maybe someone&#39;s wording or turn of phrase will make the difference and turn<br/>
on a lightbulb in someone&#39;s head at Verant and they will look again.<br/>
Probably not. But please post anyway. I don&#39;t want to see my role models of<br/>
bardhood disappear. Maybe it&#39;s time for the bards to start making some noise<br/>
rather than continuing to die quietly...?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time, dedication, advice and support.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

P.S. Please, if you reply to this message to eqbards, cut out any<br/>
unnecessary stuff in your reply so our friends on the list don&#39;t have to<br/>
read this very lengthy post again and again and again. :)<br/>
<br/>
P. P.S. Here is my post from the message boards.  Please post what you<br/>
think, write about the stuff I have forgotten and add your voice to the<br/>
boards:<br/>

Last night at peak time on the Erollisi Marr server there were over 1800<br/>
people online and a &#39;/who all bard 30 60&#39; came up with 16 bards who weren&#39;t<br/>
/anon.  Is there a problem with the bard class? No. Well, not really. Well,<br/>
actually there are many little problems with the bard class.<br/>
<br/>
But why are so many players upset and quitting their bards over such<br/>
seemingly minor problems? After all, every class has some problems with<br/>
it... and it&#39;s necessary for classes to be different to promote class<br/>
interdependence. This must be yet another typical class envy post, right?<br/>
<br/>
W R O N G !<br/>
<br/>
I started my bard one month after Erollisi Marr was created. In the past<br/>
year, I&#39;ve seen *so many* little problems with our songs.  And, like many<br/>
fine players I&#39;ve met, I tolerate them.  I work around them.  I laugh<br/>
ruefully and shrug that something so obviously broken yet so simple to fix<br/>
wasn&#39;t tested, or was somehow overlooked and I keep playing. I love my bard.<br/>
<br/>
It has never been an easy class to play.  You don&#39;t have power like a<br/>
wizard. Or soloability like a druid or necro.  You don&#39;t have heals like a<br/>
cleric and can&#39;t tank like a warrior, paladin, shadowknight or ranger. I&#39;ve<br/>
played all those classes. I know. Yet still I love my bard, despite all it&#39;s<br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
As a bard, you get nerfed with the hybrids, your songs get broken when<br/>
caster songs get adjusted, your melee capability is FAR behind any other<br/>
hybrid&#39;s ability and unlike other hybrids, you don&#39;t get a full set of<br/>
spells. Instead, you get one *song* per level.<br/>
<br/>
Songs are NOT spells. They can&#39;t be cast then forgotten. Beneficial songs<br/>
only affect group members. Direct damage songs are much weaker than even a<br/>
warrior&#39;s BASH skill. Area effect spells get you killed because your tanking<br/>
ability is nearly as weak as a caster. In fact, my druid can tank better.<br/>
Everything about the class is weak to begin with. Yet I love my bard.<br/>
<br/>
Why play such an obviously weak class? What do bard&#39;s *have* then, if we<br/>
don&#39;t get anything to compensate for the hybrid XP penalties, the weak<br/>
defensive ability, weak melee ability and limited spell selection? etc. We<br/>
have our songs. The benefit and bane of our existence. Our songs, the core<br/>
raison d&#39;etre of a bard, is why so many bards are quitting.<br/>
<br/>
Many great players of bards have put a lot of effort into exploring,<br/>
understanding and testing our songs and they have generously shared their<br/>
knowledge and experience; what type of instrument each song can use, which<br/>
songs require an instrument, which songs stack with which other songs, which<br/>
songs overwrite other classes&#39; spells. The main focus of being a bard, is to<br/>
use your songs to enhance a group. It&#39;s vital to know how your songs can<br/>
combine, affect, and enhance other classes. Therein lies the reason *so<br/>
many* bards (and other skilled players who really understand a bard&#39;s role)<br/>
are upset. Verant shows a complete lack of *understanding* about the bard<br/>
class that they miraculously created.<br/>
<br/>
This latest debacle with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby is an issue that has been<br/>
ongoing for *nearly a year* and during that time, more and more problems<br/>
with the class have been inadvertently introduced by patches to other class<br/>
capabilities. These problems *added* to the existing problems with the class<br/>
which remained unaddressed. And each time a new inadvertent problem occurs<br/>
because of a patch, many fine bards have put their heads together and tested<br/>
the songs thoroughly and discovered the problem and have even hazarded<br/>
guesses about the code causing the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Every time a new problem is introduced and old problems remain unadressed,<br/>
FACTS about the way the songs work have been presented politely, clearly and<br/>
precisely to Verant so that they can fix the problems they keep creating.<br/>
And every time, Verant *ignores* the hard work and dedication bards have put<br/>
in trying to keep this class working properly throughout the changes that<br/>
inevitably break things in subtle and complex ways.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, after many polite reminders, they quickly &#39;test&#39; the songs using<br/>
modified eqclient programs that DONT SHOW WHAT THE PLAYERS SEE (eg secondary<br/>
resist messages), they &#39;test&#39; certain functions of a song and not the other<br/>
functions of the very same song (eg see invis), they &#39;test&#39; the changes in<br/>
conditions under which the problem doesn&#39;t occur (eg lullaby by level 15<br/>
bard vs level 15), and then they CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE TESTED IT and that the<br/>
song is &#39;working as intended&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
All these problems are ON TOP of the myriad of little problems with the<br/>
class that bards have been patiently waiting to see fixed; missing songs<br/>
(the CORE of the class remains incomplete), the bard drum animation, BUGS<br/>
(such as the song that causes a dark elf to lose his natural infravision),<br/>
and other such problems that have existed SINCE THE GAME STARTED and have<br/>
yet to be repaired, addressed, or even acknowledged.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sad that so many wonderful, intelligent, thorough, polite and<br/>
dedicated players have been treated so poorly. I understand why so many<br/>
people have quit playing the bards they love and why some people feel that<br/>
it has gone too far and they must quit this great game. And like most bards,<br/>
I secretly keep hoping that someday, maybe someone at Verant with a little<br/>
bit of patience and intelligence will pay attention to the many posts we&#39;ve<br/>
made. That someone at Verant will *read* and try to *understand* what has<br/>
been written by bards rather than glancing briefly at a post and thinking<br/>
they understand what was written then proving by their responses that they<br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Paradoxically, bard players have never been a vocal group of people. We<br/>
generally play bards because we believe in the rightness of dialog and<br/>
communication rather than making the bigest bang, the loudest squeak, the<br/>
greatest noise. If anyone at Verant reads this post, REALLY reads this post,<br/>
I hope they stop and think and try to understand what has been written by so<br/>
many good people before me.</div>
