Sounds like you have enjoyed a great spot for hunting.  Might be time for<br/>
you to begin traveling to Antonica.  There is a big world out there and you<br/>
should see it.  When I was 15 thru 20, I did a lot of hunting in East Karana<br/>
and some in Highhold Pass and The Gorge of King Xorbb (Beholder Maze.)  I<br/>
like to bind in Rivervale but I am wierd and actually like that Happy Music!<br/>
Otherwise Highhold or Highkeep are good spots.  Highhold is good to learn<br/>
but kinda risky depending on how heavily camped it is.  Highold from 16 to<br/>
18/19 is good in groups.  Down in East Karana and over in North Karana,<br/>
there are bugs and stuff for 15 thru 18 or so - that you can probably still<br/>
solo.  From 18 thru 20, gnoll reavers in East karana with a group or a good<br/>
partner can earn you your surname. It did for me. Also Lake Rathe Aviak<br/>
Guards are good for high teens and even low 20&#39;s. Then from 20 and up, you<br/>
can alternate between Highkeep pickclaw goblins and South Karana aviaks.<br/>
But by then you will be needing a group for the majority of your hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy and keep us posted!<br/>

&gt; I am on CT and I have just made 15th level. (yea!) I have been hunting in<br/>
&gt; Steamfont, outside of the Mino caves and doing very well with experience.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was gaining an average of 1 bubble every 1.5 hours. I did this solo from<br/>
&gt; level 12 -15. Is there another place like this that I can go to? Also when<br/>
&gt; should I start doing any Bard specific quests?<br/>
