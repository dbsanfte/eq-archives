<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819159881">Don&#39;t get me started on binding.  Of course they already have To go find<br/>
food and water too (egad!).  I think having npc&#39;s to fix things would help<br/>
as you&#39;d know they&#39;d always be there AND they would charge money that would<br/>
be permanently out of the economy as well.  This would greatly improve the<br/>
role-playing aspects of the game and preserve the economy.  More people<br/>
would also be buying merchant sold armors and weapons because they knew they<br/>
could replace them and because they could be fixed by cheaper pc<br/>
smiths/tailors (if Verant was smart).  <br/>
<br/>
This stuff would be a big job to code but would make the game tons more fun<br/>
in the long run as there would be many more goals available than just<br/>
reaching 50th level (or whatever limit).  Those boxes of lute strings would<br/>
suddenly be worthwhile!  What the heck are they for anyhow?<br/>
<br/>
These are just ramblings but hopefully will happen one day in order to help<br/>
slow the progression of people thru the game (in and out as goals decrease)<br/>
as well as building a more real economy and interactive world.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, shouldn&#39;t singing and instrument skills supplement begging?<br/>

I agree.  Once a fairly decent item enters the game, there is little to no<br/>
chance of it ever &quot;leaving&quot; the world.  There needs to be an infinite money<br/>
and/or equipment &quot;sink&quot; added to this game.  I would love to see a &quot;item<br/>
degredation&quot; system implemented.  The majority of gripes will come from the<br/>
melee classes - who rely almost exclusively on their equipment.  It would<br/>
almost be a requirement to learn the skill that allowed a character to<br/>
repair damaged items.  The other big gripe would be, &quot;I spend X amount of<br/>
time looking for a bind, now I have to look for someone to repair my<br/>
equipment as well?&quot;.  A lot of people would whine about a change like this -<br/>
I would love to see it though.  What about allowing a MOB who kills you, to<br/>
loot one item from your inventory (and then it&#39;s gone forever)?  Actually,<br/>
that might be way too drastic (I&#39;ve already died 8 times this level :p )<br/>
