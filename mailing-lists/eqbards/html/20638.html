About auto-pulling.<br/>
It isn&#39;t you, well not directly anyhow.  More likely it is the puller.<br/>
Here&#39;s what happens.  The puller pulls something.  They get on the hate list<br/>
of something else that they did not pull, generally because they outran it.<br/>
This critter passes the puller on to the hate list of every mob it runs by.<br/>
You pulse a song on the puller and you get added to every single one of<br/>
those hate lists.<br/>
<br/>
To prove it to the group.  You alone camp out.  Sing no songs when you<br/>
return and happily run about in obvious chase range of mobs.  Then let the<br/>
other group members go into chase range one at a time until something<br/>
auto-pulls.  That&#39;s the guy on the lists.  If you pulse a song on him you<br/>
too will be on all those lists.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Feeling kinda useless sometimes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, I know we&#39;re a powerful class, and I&#39;ve have a lot of fun (and get a<br/>
lot of compliments) working in unbalanced groups and pulling them<br/>
together.  I love groups with lots of casters or lots of melees, it<br/>
makes me feel like I&#39;m really accomplishing something.<br/>
<br/>
My problem:  I play mostly on the weekends, and since I&#39;m in a pretty<br/>
tight guild (and a lot of them are available on the weekend), I play<br/>
mostly with my guild.  This means that a typical party is:  Me,<br/>
Enchanter, Cleric, maybe a Shaman, tanks.  The tanks always include at<br/>
least one ranger/druid (snare) or paladin (root) for stopping MOBs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the Enchanter that&#39;s getting me depressed, although the Shaman and<br/>
the snarers don&#39;t help.  All of my party buffs have speed components,<br/>
but his are better.  I can&#39;t use anything that does AE damage due to the<br/>
mez.  In large group efforts (like the Planes) I&#39;m forbidden from using<br/>
DOTs since nobody wants the MOBs to poof.  My slowdown songs are no<br/>
better than the Enchanter&#39;s (and his stick for the duration once cast)<br/>
and vastly worse than the Shamans.  So:  VoV is kind of useless, since<br/>
only the STR and weak AC components come into play, Fear is out of the<br/>
question (ooq), Chains sucks and is redundant, Nivs is kind of pointless<br/>
given that we they try to keep the MOB focused on one or two tanks, and<br/>
for the most part, we get through fights with no damage to 3 or 4 party<br/>
members (and of course, the damage shield lasts like .001 second on the<br/>
tank taking the damage, killing the song).  What the heck am I supposed<br/>
to be playing?  Especially against melee MOBs?  I&#39;m feeling like a melee<br/>
imposter with a Mana song attached.  Sometimes I sing DOT songs (against<br/>
my instructions) until the MOBs are down to 1/3rd or so, then switch to<br/>
Nivs/Mana, sometimes I just sigh and sing Vov/Mana/Nivs/Mana and feebly<br/>
whack away.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we were playing in Karnors on skel tower yesterday.  We did not<br/>
have to pull anything, the MOBs just kept bum-rushing us.  It was kind<br/>
of cool (lots of exp) but kind of scary at the same time.  Needless to<br/>
say, everyone blamed me.  Some of them (not all of them) only stopped<br/>
when our entire party camped out and relogged.  Now, if it was me, then<br/>
I would expect to see this happen regularly.  I don&#39;t.  What does<br/>
regularly happen, though, is that every time something screwy like this<br/>
happens, I get blamed for it.  It gets kinda irritating.  Have any of<br/>
you worked out appropriate responses?<br/>
<br/>
Kenross Cantoforjado, 51 songs, Innoruuk, off to Hate.  Wish me luck on<br/>
the Bard drops.<br/>
