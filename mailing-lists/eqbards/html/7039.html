<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426750865">Well, they&#39;ve got more than a lot of games.  There&#39;s several varietys of<br/>
engagement rings and wedding rings.  There are also two types of champagne<br/>
(although one is lore).  Maybe if they made the gossimer robe wearable by<br/>
all it would be a close approximation  :)<br/>
Besides, some of us happen to like the Pamela Lee look  :)<br/>

Weddings are a fairly important social event in Norrath, so why can&#39;t Verant<br/>
put<br/>
in a few items for no purpose other then celebrations: Wedding Dresses,<br/>
Wedding<br/>
cake, Champaign, & Flowers (courting RP&#39;s would love this).</div>
