<div id="ygrps-yiv-279143443">I doubt it&#39;s a quest.  Far more ikely they just ran out of ideas for what<br/>
Effects the pieces should have so haven&#39;t put them in yet.<br/>

i really thought i would have gotten more interest in this, and maybe<br/>
sparked verant to look at it, so i have a question about all this... do you<br/>
think i am wrong? am i just comlaining? or does no one really care at this<br/>
point? are there a lot of bards here hunting in sebilis and hoping for some<br/>
new armor? well, if you want the thread again here it is:<br/>

i just want to have the same chance as all the other classes at the new<br/>
armor set from kunark that we are all entitled too, and what i have come to<br/>
believe at this point does not exist.  could it be the quest?  maybe but i<br/>
doubt it.  every single other class has their pieces drop in sebilis, why<br/>
have bards quest for it?  oh well...<br/>

&gt; 	My guess, and it ties into the Burynai Bunt Cake quest <br/>
&gt; that we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; figgered out yet, is that the helm that Treekill gives as the <br/>
&gt; reward is the<br/>
&gt; Singing Steel Helm. His talk says that he got it from a bard, <br/>
&gt; that the helm<br/>
&gt; is only usable by bards, and that the bard said it came from <br/>
&gt; Sebilis where<br/>
&gt; all of the class helms are coming from that I know of.<br/>
&gt; 	If the quest for the cake turns out to be quite <br/>
&gt; elaborate and time<br/>
&gt; consuming then I can see Verant putting this as the reward.<br/>
