 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s another thing to consider.  If you&#39;re going to base it<br/>
on who will get the best use out of it, are you basing it on<br/>
raw numerical improvement, or percentage improvement?  A large<br/>
portion of a rogues damage comes from his backstab.  Replacing<br/>
(say) a dragoon dirk with an EBW in his off hand may only<br/>
improve his damage output by 2%-3%.  But for a bard it could<br/>
represent an improvement of 10%-15%.<br/>
<br/>
Also, will he be using it in his primary hand or his<br/>
secondary?  If it&#39;s going in his secondary, but would go in<br/>
your primary, then arguably your raw numerical damage<br/>
improvement would be greater than his because you&#39;re going to<br/>
swing the weapon every round, while he, even with double<br/>
attack, is only going to swing it roughly 85% of the time (65%<br/>
dual wield, 20% double attack, if I remember those figures<br/>
right).<br/>
<br/>
There are so many ways to slice this that it&#39;s foolish to do<br/>
merit-based distribution based on only one criterion.<br/>
