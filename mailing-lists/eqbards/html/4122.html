<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311913456">Given that you&#39;re only 25th, you&#39;re a bit limited in non-party or target<br/>
songs since pickclaws are so much higher level than you... you can help this<br/>
by raising your CHA (items, shaman / enchanter buffs), also if you can get<br/>
an enchanter in your group tashani&#39;ing will help significantly.<br/>
<br/>
Chant of Battle - Might want to use this instead of Anthem, especially if<br/>
anyone&#39;s using proc&#39;ing weapons.  Some will argue the slight speedup isn&#39;t<br/>
worth the extra dex chant gives ya.<br/>
<br/>
Chords & Discord - Both are extremely useful especially when stacked and one<br/>
of them is played, but in HK I&#39;m a bit warry of using them, I&#39;m always<br/>
afraid i&#39;ll get a guard in the radius through a ceiling or something.<br/>
<br/>
Binding - The -AC will be useful especially if your melee types are well<br/>
below the goblins as well.  Otherwise Chain&#39;s preferable.<br/>
<br/>
Chain - This song&#39;s wonderful.  Especially in HK where runner control is<br/>
needed.<br/>

&gt;I have a question.  I am currently lvl 25 and the 3 songs that I twist when<br/>
&gt;I am in a group in High Keep are Anthem, Psalm of Warmth, and healing.  I<br/>

&gt;on them.  Since these post mention that a lvl 20 playing a hymn song is sad<br/>
&gt;can you all tell me what other song that I can play to improve my group?  I<br/>
