<div id="ygrps-yiv-663002161">It was decided early on that all casting classes (not hybrids) would have<br/>
Gate, and only a couple classes would have Bind Affinity.  As a matter of<br/>
fact, some of you early phase testers might recall that Bind used to require<br/>
a then hard to find and costly stone to cast.<br/>
<br/>
After a lot of heated debate, the spell was given to all pure casters, and<br/>
after more heated debate the cost of the spell became mana only.  You don&#39;t<br/>
want to know how ugly it got when the idea of the casters being able to self<br/>
bind anywhere besides in an adventure zone came up.<br/>
<br/>
So, I wouldn&#39;t ever expect any of the hybrid classes to be able to bind.  It<br/>
is not going to happen, it&#39;s something of a concession that bind even works<br/>
the way it does now.  The idea of inns or static NPC&#39;s that could bind was<br/>
kicked around back in beta, and rejected.<br/>
<br/>
This is akin to the exp loss reductions that have twice occurred, once in<br/>
Beta, and once again in Final.  Both times, there was a very strong negative<br/>
reaction from many members of the development team, a schism if you will.<br/>
But in the name of  the holy grail of &quot;playability&quot;, the experience loss<br/>
reductions were implemented.   This was partially offset by the increased<br/>
experience needed for levels after 25th implemented a few weeks earlier (but<br/>
much too late imho, the damage was done)<br/>
<br/>
In the case of experience loss, the changes were made to help out the game&#39;s<br/>
actual market.  The mass market, RPG newcomer.   The game is complex by<br/>
design, lightly documented by design, and often daunting, and far too many<br/>
folks bypass the built in training curve via various methods, leaving them<br/>
at moderately high levels with very deficient play skills (and character<br/>
skills).<br/>
<br/>
Those folks tended to die a lot more often than was necessary all of a<br/>
sudden, and watching that exp bar keep dropping was pretty discouraging,<br/>
especially when you didn&#39;t learn from your mistakes.  And there are the<br/>
inevitable bugs and zone crashes that were fairly common early in retail and<br/>
still persist.  After a bit of this, people start to  vote with their feet.<br/>
And since the bulk of the player base fell into this category in one way or<br/>
another, from a business standpoint it was suicidal to stand by design<br/>
principles in this case.<br/>
<br/>
With the success of EQ, I&#39;m hoping the existing player base will in the<br/>
future be educated enough about RPGs in general, and Verant quirks in<br/>
specific, so that when EQ2 rolls out, the bar can be raised in terms of<br/>
experience and rate of progression/regression.  Hitting the level cap in 45<br/>
days is appalling to me.  Hitting it in 120 days, no matter how dedicated a<br/>
player you are, still makes me twitch and drool some.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Bind Affinity, there&#39;s more than enough bind capable players<br/>
online on any server at any time to accommodate player needs.  The only time<br/>
this is not the case is when a fresh server comes online, and the race to<br/>
12th or 14th level is on, and those few casters that reach it first are<br/>
heavily in demand..but only for a matter of days or even hours.<br/>
<br/>
This is still a strong balancing factor.  Synergy.  Interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you ask, why did I compare the experience loss changes to giving Bind<br/>
Affinity to everyone, either by spell or by NPC&#39;s?  Well, both rank right up<br/>
there as the most requested changes to the game.  One happened, one won&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; &gt;What I would like to see is an NPC that could bind for a fee, and limit<br/>
&gt; &gt;class based binding to one of a few classes. The advantage that the<br/>
class/es<br/>
&gt; &gt;would have is the ability to bind themselves away from a city, which is a<br/>
&gt; &gt;nice limit for the NPC&#39;s. Make sense to me if you want to foster a sense<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt;being able to explore the world safely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, that would make a heckuva lot of sense. J.M., mebbe you could<br/>
&gt; suggest this idea:<br/>
&gt; Inn-running NPC&#39;s could, when given the proper coin, cast a &quot;bind&quot; spell<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; a player. To determine the cost, hail the Innkeeper, and ask the cost for<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; night.  It would make sense, RP-wise, and if you made it cost, say 1 plat,<br/>
&gt; players could still undercut the merchants, but other players wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; SOL.  This would still encourage players to work together to get bound in<br/>
&gt; certain areas (not every zone has an Inn, most Inns are inconvenient at<br/>
&gt; best. Certain Inns have associated hazards...), but allow travelers to<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; safer traveling.<br/>
