<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516072165">Actually the facts are:<br/>
<br/>
Kunark was in &quot;in house&quot; beta for over 3 months and was in &quot;closed&quot; beta<br/>
with 1000 players for about  5-6 weeks.  They concentrated for the first<br/>
several weeks on &#39;holes&#39; etc.  Trust me dying by falling through the world<br/>
is not fun.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I agree they didn&#39;t test Kunark enough.  Then again they sent EQ<br/>
&quot;Live&quot; before any of those of us in the Beta Test felt it was ready as well.<br/>
Unfortunately Verant has to answer to it&#39;s stockholders and it&#39;s board of<br/>
directors ;)  Shipping deadlines are a pain ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Also remember that this is the first time that Trakanon has been slain.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, it&#39;s likely a dragon&#39;s loot table is checked a little more<br/>
&gt; carefully than the run of the mill mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Interesting rumours I heard lately: Of the (3!?) weeks that Kunark was<br/>
&gt; in beta, 2 were dedicated to geometry testing (can you find places to<br/>
&gt; fall through the world). That left one week for the unpaid testers to<br/>
&gt; check dungeons, etc. Also, appearantly Verant&#39;s paid testing department<br/>
&gt; consists of 4 employees. That would explain why Gordon has to go test<br/>
&gt; things like spell drops.<br/>
