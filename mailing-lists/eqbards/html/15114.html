&gt; For those who wonder why we rant about Verant&#39;s poor customer service,<br/>
&gt; and their seemingless unfathomable denials when presented with a mistake<br/>
&gt; they made (&quot;We test extensively&quot;), read these these 4 updates from the<br/>
&gt; EQ offcial network status pages (I have compiled them from the two<br/>
&gt; seperate lists, and cut out any ones not related to scheduled patching<br/>
&gt; downtime).<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a> has the entire network status messages.<br/>

&gt; Update Thu Feb 17 13:34:23 EST 2000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The amount of time that the servers will be down is approximately 6<br/>
&gt; hours. That would put the time at 2 PM PST<br/>
&gt; for the servers to be back up.<br/>

&gt; Patch Update Thu Feb 17 17:45:13 EST 2000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The patch is progressing as planned, and all servers should be available<br/>
&gt; around 3:00pm PST.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - The EverQuest Team<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (My note:  I was able to log on at 6:30 EST, thats 3:30 PST, and was<br/>
&gt; unable to at 6:27.)<br/>
&gt; This last message is the kicker, and I almost fell out of my chair when<br/>
&gt; I read it.  When looking at 3 messages stating delays, they post it as<br/>
&gt; &quot;progressing as planned&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a few problems with this.<br/>
&gt; 1.  This the second time in 2 weeks they changed the date on a major<br/>
&gt; scheduled downtime.  My bother scheduling downtime, if you;re not going<br/>
&gt; to keep it?  My cleric group plays once a week (and is the main reason I<br/>
&gt; play EQ, I love my bard, but I think i would leave the game if I didn;t<br/>
&gt; have my regular cleric group).  We make sure our day does not coincide<br/>
&gt; with their scheduled downtime since we face such time constraints<br/>
&gt; (normally play from 5ish to 11ish). The rest of the group was able to<br/>
&gt; get in around 7, so our time this week was cut by 1/3, despite our best<br/>
&gt; efforts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  Why aren&#39;t these downtimes scheduled about 3-5 horus earlier, when<br/>
&gt; there are many less paying customers trying to play?  I feel bad for the<br/>
&gt; people in Europe in Asia, but America represents the majority of their<br/>
&gt; customer base.  I would even be happier if they would rotate down times<br/>
&gt; so different people were affected each time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  How much time was wasted writing the True North spell.  I&#39;m sure we<br/>
&gt; could all name about 20 things which everyone in the game would rather<br/>
&gt; have seen that time spent fixing.  Has anyone thought of a use for this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4.  How do things which directly contradict the patch messages make it<br/>
&gt; past their &quot;extensive testing?&quot;<br/>
