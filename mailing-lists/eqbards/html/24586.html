<div id="ygrps-yiv-167471405">My stuck in 54 is as much as my own activities - raiding and bad luck -<br/>
deaths with only a 49-54 cleric to rez me...  Guild mergers are definitely<br/>
in order these days.  IMHO Verant has continued down the path of ignoring<br/>
the needs of &quot;casual&quot; players and focusing on those who &quot;Live&quot; in the game.<br/>
Clearly it&#39;s geared to &quot;Uber&quot; Guilds (gad I hate that term).  Considering<br/>
zones like Western Wastes - you can&#39;t even consider going in there without a<br/>
large group.<br/>
<br/>
Well, before I get into a Dennis Miller type rant; I was in a guild (Order<br/>
of Norrath) that had 13-active players - about half at my level range.  We<br/>
decided that it would be best to join a larger guild.  I had been very good<br/>
friends with the leaders and quite a few members of the Dragons of Kel&#39;Dar -<br/>
so I proposed a &quot;merger&quot; that developed.  We had one person that didn&#39;t make<br/>
it (an immature 13-year old who only got into the guild because of a RL<br/>
friend who was in our guild with good standing).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - my new guild has had a LOT of growth lately and is now about 90<br/>
peoples (including the 12 from my guild).  About half are under 40 - so I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t call us &quot;Uber&quot; but at least we can consider doing stuff that would<br/>
be next to if not completely impossible for me to do in the past.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly - my knowledge of the Dragons and their people make me feel<br/>
confident that other than the size - the outlook, philosophy and culture of<br/>
the two guilds are very similar and it should be a good fit.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall knowing people from the League of Gallantry; but I have run<br/>
across a good amount of Dragons Claw people - and know it to be a good<br/>
Guild - good luck on your merger.<br/>

Apologies to the nonXegony bards.<br/>
<br/>
I was away yesterday, and missed this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Slyde - I did kinda change guilds. Excalibur is a great guild,<br/>
&gt; but just never able to field enough folks of a similiar level<br/>
&gt; to go do anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think guild size is hitting a few of us. Dragon&#39;s Claw has always<br/>
been &quot;almost there&quot;, but we have always had to pull in a few friends<br/>
for the larger kills -- VS, Char Royalty, etc... We were lucky enough<br/>
to find another guild -- League of Gallantry -- who share DC&#39;s goals<br/>
and vision, and who were looking to become a bit larger. Tonight is<br/>
the official merger of the two guilds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Darkfox - We were actually after the Procurator for a key to<br/>
&gt; South and hopefully a bard mask.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must have missed this... what Bard mask?<br/>
<br/>
Brilinnia: Grats on the BP!<br/>
Slyde: 54 is bad, but I am sure you will be 55 soon enough.<br/>
Darkfox: Good to actually spend a few minutes talking to you face-to-<br/>
face over the weekend. I think that is the first time I have ever<br/>
talked to you when I could see you. *Grins*<br/>
<br/>
As for the silly Wizard porting your group on accident, our last trip<br/>
into HS was also interrupted by a wizard hitting the wrong spell and<br/>
porting his group out. Although the worst miscast spell I have<br/>
witnessed in there was about two weeks ago -- a druid friend and I<br/>
thought we would get some exp and go solo the entrance to HS (we<br/>
have &quot;broken&quot; it before waiting for others to arrive.) Anway, she<br/>
gets HTed by a new spawn and goes to heal herself... the next thing I<br/>
know she is dead! Seems she accidentially DDed herself (talk about a<br/>
bad time not to resist. *Smiles*) So... there I am, stuck with two<br/>
MOBs and no help. All I can say is thank Erollisi for SoT and Thurg<br/>
gate potions. *Grins*<br/>
