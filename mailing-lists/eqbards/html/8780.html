<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-646215395">The Pugius dagger can be looted off a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest.  The<br/>
stats you listed (6 DAM/ 23 DLY) are the stats for a dragoon dirk.  I think<br/>
the stats for a Pugius dagger are 5 DAM 21 DLY (thats off the top of my head<br/>
but I can&#39;t remember for certain).  I had one a long time ago so its<br/>
possible the stats on it got improved after I sold it.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I acquired a Pugius dagger quite some time ago from a friendly bard for<br/>
&gt; only <br/>
&gt; 25pp.  It&#39;s stats are 6dam 23 delay magic peircing.  Its damage ratio is <br/>
&gt; just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t have any stat <br/>
&gt; increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon be found?<br/>
&gt; It <br/>
&gt; looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the only one I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he got it...so<br/>
&gt; any <br/>
&gt; help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same <br/>
&gt; graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>
