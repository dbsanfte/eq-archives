<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035876948">Big time.  Currently - if you have some &quot;extra&quot; characters you don&#39;t want -<br/>
you&#39;d have to sell your entire account.  If there&#39;s characters on that<br/>
account you want to keep you&#39;re SOL.<br/>
<br/>
Now you can simply buy a new account - transfer the char over - and sell it<br/>
off singly.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a two accounts anyway - and one is a PL&#39;er character like a<br/>
Druid - you can create it on your second account - and not even bother to<br/>
buy the third account until you have a buyer.  If you do this over time (ie<br/>
don&#39;t powerlevel quickly - but over a couple of months) - you&#39;ll save<br/>
$10/month by PL&#39;ing it on an existing account.<br/>

I don&#39;t understand how e-bay relates to characters moving between<br/>
accounts or servers.  You see e-bayers now, how will the number of<br/>
ebayers you see change?<br/>

Seems to me that with what they are charging - it&#39;s going to be a<br/>
&quot;profit<br/>
center&quot; for Verant.  I&#39;m concerned that Bards will be the type of<br/>
character<br/>
where we&#39;ll see significant E-Bay&#39;ers.  I expect to see a lot of bards<br/>
in SS<br/>
and POG armor with no idea how the songs work - let alone twisting.<br/>
