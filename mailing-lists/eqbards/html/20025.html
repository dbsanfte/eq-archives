<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541913630">Heh heh, didn&#39;t mean to set ya off, wasn&#39;t really aimed at you Lyrnia.  It&#39;s<br/>
pretty apparent to anyone who is more than a casual observer that you do<br/>
roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
I chose Erollisi as well.  Interestingly the Erollisi Mantraps in Swamp of<br/>
No Hope are not aggressive.  Go figure.  I figure the Iksar named them, so<br/>
it&#39;s not surprising they feel threatened by a deity that portrays emotional<br/>
attachment as a &#39;good&#39; thing.<br/>
<br/>
But if you think that&#39;s bad, try going to the Isle of Erollisi without<br/>
shedding a tear.  I remember the first time I found out where Purity Belts<br/>
really came from, oh my was that a painful revelation.  I spent the next<br/>
couple of hours travelling between W Commons and Freeport proclaiming to all<br/>
(/shout) that those who who sold such things were in fact evil slayers of<br/>
innocent women.  A gm actually came and told me it was against the rules to<br/>
walk thru the zones spamming.  Apparently there is no freedom of religion in<br/>
&quot;the Vision&quot;.  I nearly quit over that incident, though my friends begged me<br/>
to stay and I couldn&#39;t say no.<br/>

Actually I chose to worship Erollisi Marr.  I roleplay very well.  I also<br/>
think it&#39;s disgusting that the Flowers in EJ (Erollisi something or other)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate.  I don&#39;t mind the idea.  I&#39;d just like to see the currenly<br/>
broken stuff get fixed before they implement anything else &quot;new&quot;.  We have<br/>
enough problems.  The last thing I need is to get killed walking into a bard<br/>
guild because they somehow screwed up god factions.<br/>
