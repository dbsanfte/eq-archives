<div id="ygrps-yiv-340552206"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That it took a level 8ish mob 20+ spells for me (L30) to see<br/>
&gt; one complete resist should tell you something about how<br/>
&gt; difficult this check is.  I was singing Elemental Rhythms at<br/>
&gt; the time with drum equipped, which put my MR in the 80s and FR<br/>
&gt; in the 70s.  I wasn&#39;t trying too hard to keep it up though, so<br/>
&gt; it may have dropped to my natural 35/25.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had much better luck at resisting magic, fire and cold based spells I<br/>
guess. I get the resist messages generally at least once a night.  Of<br/>
course, I used to get it closer to once a week before I picked up my runed<br/>
bone fork. Makes a nice range weapon. :-)  Spoiler below....<br/>

For those that don&#39;t know, this weapon is kind of ok as a piercing weapon,<br/>
but because of its stats it shines as a ranged weapon.  It adds 10 to magic,<br/>
fire and cold resist.  This great weapon can be found in Upper Guk on a mob<br/>
that was green to me at level 25 when I got mine (Hint: Its the same frog<br/>
that carries the necklace of undead protection).  The fork is a rare drop,<br/>
took a week for me and the other member of my regular party to each get one.</div>
