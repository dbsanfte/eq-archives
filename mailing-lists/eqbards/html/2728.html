You are mistaken Verant did not change the quest nor is it an issue<br/>
of stacked quests.  As best I can figure .. I did 4 of the mail runs<br/>
last night.  Only the freeport one is broken... I petitioned it<br/>
I should have bugged it.. my bad.  However mail out of freeport to any<br/>
where else works fine.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Just don&#39;t stack the quests.  I did that and by the time I made it from<br/>
&gt; &gt;Kelethin to Freeport, all I got was a &#39;Thank you very much&#39; instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the adjustments, xp, and cash.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t stack quests and got the same result.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My guess is that once again Verant has failed to write reasonably clear<br/>
&gt; English.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The quest source in Kelethin says who to deliver to in Freeport.  That<br/>
&gt; person says if you want to find out about mail talk to another person in<br/>
&gt; the same room.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s my guess that the second person&#39;s generic response which sounds simply<br/>
&gt; like a quest beginning is somehow supposed to tell you not to follow the<br/>
&gt; instructions you were given in Kelethin but to give the mail to someone<br/>
&gt; else there in Freeport.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know they mean well, but Verant&#39;s consistent inability accurately to<br/>
&gt; communicate what we&#39;re supposed to know results in considerable frustration<br/>
&gt; and wasted effort in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After this happened I sent /feedback.  I have little reason to believe that<br/>
&gt; /feedback goes anywhere but an overloaded, bottomless pit of ignored input.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I will undoubtedly keep spending far too many hours playing this silly<br/>
&gt; game.<br/>
