<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754575563">Heheheh, I was thinking - I would take an RBB if it was given to me (we <br/>
don&#39;t do /random with loots, it&#39;s lame imo), but why would I? It would be <br/>
better suited for the real damage dealers. I&#39;ll just stick it out, and wait <br/>
until I can score a belt of concordance. This is from the point of view of a <br/>
bard that groups with the same group/guild/people every night.<br/>

&gt;How on earth did they let a bard have a runed bolster belt? =)<br/>
&gt;Seriously, being the weakest of the melee classes what sort of dragon<br/>
&gt;loot system is used that allowed you to be have such an item. Also does<br/>
&gt;it make you ineligible for Selo&#39;s drum and Horn of War?<br/>
&gt;A few improvements in your equipment I might add if you dont mind which<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re probably already aware of.<br/>
&gt;Wear Imbrued gloves (assuming you have them), the lambent ones are just<br/>
&gt;awful looking. If you&#39;re ever able to get a Tranix crown, wear that over<br/>
&gt;Imbrued (assuming you dont have one). Imbrued helm also looks awful =).<br/>
&gt;Crested spaulders -better ac and hp, dex useless since your weapons dont<br/>
&gt;proc. Hooded black cloak if you&#39;re lucky enough to obtain one - the 45<br/>
&gt;hp outweighs the extra 2 ac on cloak of shadows in my opinion.<br/>
&gt;Diamondine earrings - 122 charisma is plenty so you can afford to lose<br/>
&gt;the opallines, especially if you choose Tranix over Imbrued.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m still trying to figure out why your dex is so high. Imbrued BP (13),<br/>
&gt;bracer (3), Gloves (5), Belt (10), Pauldrons (7 or 9?), Cloak (5). Also<br/>
&gt;how much hp does the bolster belt give you? I&#39;m assuming roughly 30 hp.<br/>
&gt;Please let me know.<br/>
