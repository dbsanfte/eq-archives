<div id="ygrps-yiv-460847558">OOO cool.. someone on bristlebane reads this... (Yes,<br/>
Talies, I realize you are also on Bristlebane)  <br/>
<br/>
I just hit 27, so I have been experimenting with<br/>
charm... Perhaps a bit of an unorthodox use but here<br/>
is what ive been doing.<br/>
<br/>
I get on a list for a high keep group... Then for the<br/>
next 2 hours, I have to do something... So I either do<br/>
baking, brewing, or lately, I&#39;ve taken to helping an<br/>
enchanter friend lvl (he hit 19 last night) We go to<br/>
orc side and stand a bit away from the crowd, when<br/>
something spawns and hits me first (has to hit me<br/>
otherwise my enchanter friends ethics cause him to<br/>
think we are ks&#39;ing) I charm it /pet follow over to<br/>
the area away from the fighting. I then beat on it,<br/>
till three quarters dead (or keep it charmed so the<br/>
other ppl cant steal it...) and then my friend mem<br/>
blurs it and finishes it off..  Really slow because he<br/>
keeps giving the orcs away, so ppl wont think we are<br/>
ks&#39;ing<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; With the arrival of level 26 and Area effect Fear,<br/>
&gt; my strategy will most<br/>
&gt; likely change.  I was thinking of using, Snare,<br/>
&gt; Fear, Dot... and repeat<br/>
&gt; the cycle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, since at 27 we get charm, what creature do you<br/>
&gt; suggest I play with<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you in advance,<br/>
