<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186902506"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kbachman@...">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see from the board that many of you are upset that the undead spawns in <br/>
&gt;Kithicor were<br/>
&gt;stopped.  I&#39;d like to make the following points:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Kithicor is, at one and the same time, a newbie zone AND a zone that <br/>
&gt;you MUST<br/>
&gt;travel through in order to get from the four eastern cities to RV, and that <br/>
&gt;you would<br/>
&gt;much prefer to use to get from RV to High Keep.  Note that the alternate <br/>
&gt;route to<br/>
&gt;HK/Qeynos/Halas from RV takes you through Runnyeye and Beholder, hardly <br/>
&gt;safe zones<br/>
&gt;below level 20 or so, and takes a LOT longer to HK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what? The Karana&#39;s are just as dangerous. Hill Giants, Griffs, <br/>
werewolves, Evil Eyes, Wolves, Lions, Bandits, Gnoll Reavers.  West Commons <br/>
has Ghouls, dervs, orcs, Hill Giants, Griffins, Dragoons, Kodiaks, and other <br/>
high level nasties. Travels should be dangerous.   BTW I made my first trip <br/>
from Kelethin to Qeynos at 6th level when my server was only 4 days old.  <br/>
THAT was a dangerous trip. On mature servers the trip now is a joke, you can <br/>
travel clear across the Karana&#39;s and see nothing more dangerous then a <br/>
will-o-wisp.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2.  The fact that these spawn only appeared at night is not a help.  In <br/>
&gt;order to<br/>
&gt;traverse the zone safely, this would require you to wait until dawn each <br/>
&gt;time you<br/>
&gt;wanted to get through the zone (unless you were sufficiently high level <br/>
&gt;that it didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;matter, see point 3).  If you thought waiting for the boat was <br/>
&gt;irritating...   This is<br/>
&gt;NOT a good use of playing time.  Plus, although the spawn did not appear <br/>
&gt;during the<br/>
&gt;daytime, I am not convinced that they actually evaporated at dawn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Know that it is a night time spawn makes it easy to avoid.  Makes travel a <br/>
little less mindless.  Lord forbid if you have to wait 15 to 20 mins before <br/>
running to your camping spot for the night.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3.  I travelled through Kithicor the other night at the tail end of the <br/>
&gt;event.  Even<br/>
&gt;with sixty people actively hunting, I blundered into 3 spawn points between <br/>
&gt;WC and RV,<br/>
&gt;and 2 points between RV and HP.  Luckily, three of them had not yet <br/>
&gt;&quot;dropped&quot; from the<br/>
&gt;sky, and the other two I was able to put on the brakes for (barely), but I <br/>
&gt;note the<br/>
&gt;following:  1)  two of these points were so close to the zone wall that <br/>
&gt;even the &quot;edge<br/>
&gt;of zone&quot; travel method would not have worked, and 2) the one MOB that <br/>
&gt;engaged me killed<br/>
&gt;me (a level THIRTY ONE Bard) in three casts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would love to see a high level outdoor zone, myself, but it should not <br/>
&gt;replace a<br/>
&gt;newbie zone, and it should certainly not be placed in a zone critical for <br/>
&gt;low- to<br/>
&gt;mid-level travel.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>BTW I was on the test server last night and Kithicor is still spawning <br/>
undead at night there.  My poor 5th lvl cleric got nuked by a Risen <br/>
Commander and was bound in Qeynos :(  The Karanas are a long run without <br/>
Selos, but at least a friendly Shamen helped me out with a SoW.  Managed to <br/>
get back to my body by 6pm game time.  It was very excitiing wandering if I <br/>
would make it back before nightfall, since if I did not my body would decay.<br/>
