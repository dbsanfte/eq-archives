<div id="ygrps-yiv-551977302">Ya gotta remember the other bards might not be at the same lev u r.  If you<br/>
got charm and mez - u r not in the lookout room &lt;g&gt; you&#39;re a couple levels<br/>
deeper!  I know I get lots of good advice from a fellow bard but it usually<br/>
includes using a couple songs that I don&#39;t get for a couple more levels -<br/>
careful readers saw one today - I asked of which 2 songs is better at<br/>
slowing attack speeds and I got told that 2 other songs are better - well<br/>
that&#39;s all fine and dandy but I don&#39;t got them songs (not even pre-bought<br/>
cuz I know what bad luck that brings ya &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
So - ya we bellow - but that might be the best we got?  And there maybe a<br/>
couple &quot;surge of strength...&quot; and &quot;protected by magical aura...&quot; that u<br/>
don&#39;t see (cuz u r not grouped with them) between the bellows u do see.   <br/>
<br/>
BTW - I got pretty brave now - in HighKeep I&#39;ll use Denon&#39;s and Lullaby --<br/>
AE or Z-axis seem to be no problems.  Well  the other rooms are well camped<br/>
usually  but I don&#39;t see any hits or misses on stuff from the other rooms.<br/>
Only potential problems is some gobbie train goes up and Guards come down<br/>
chasing it back down - saw  Captn Boesic ks&#39;ing on the ramp the other day -<br/>
offered to train him out for 20pp but got no takers :-)  Or if u run up<br/>
chasin some gobbie and forget and leave Denons on.<br/>
<br/>
Hehe AE and Z axis are not just deadly indoors.........there I was...pullin<br/>
for my group off the aviak villiage.  So I run in to nab something and it<br/>
musta been right after a fight - we were all SoW&#39;d (which I normally rant<br/>
about but was a good thing this time) and I musta forgot and left Denons on<br/>
- so I make a fast lap around the trees and don&#39;t see nutthin - then hmm a<br/>
harrier at the ramp - bellow! /g inc harrier run back the party - turn<br/>
around and .... 6 birties including Mr Avo!!!  &quot;Nice pull Sylly!&quot;  LOADING,<br/>
PLEASE WAIT  The rest of the party took off for the zone and lived. <br/>
<br/>
So my 1 thru 4 hot keys are buff du jour (anthem or chant depending on if<br/>
party likes str or dex), bellow, denons, chains  - this is for me being<br/>
battle bard and in melee combat.  Other song loaded are lullaby, guardian<br/>
rythmns, hymn,  and jig  (hmm usually have selos up too but inside Keep no<br/>
need really.)<br/>

		One thing that pains me more then anything is to see a Bard<br/>
that ONLY uses <br/>
		bellow in combat :(  I have been spending time in High Keep<br/>
for the last few <br/>
		levels, and when I see a message flash across my screen<br/>
showing a bard just <br/>
		bellowing his/her heart out I wince.  When I am not in my<br/>
regular group I <br/>
		always explain the tactics I will be using with something<br/>
like this:<br/>
		Tonight&#39;s song list consists of the following in regular<br/>
combat: Anthem &#39;de <br/>
		Arms (boast str, atk speed), Psalm of warth (grp damage<br/>
shield and AC), <br/>
		chains (slow atk spd and snare).  Do not snare or root<br/>
unless I call for it.<br/>
<br/>
		Then a second one saying:<br/>
		If a gob is glowing red and I am not attacking leave it<br/>
alone I mesmirizing <br/>
		it.  If I call out charming so and so, I have charmed that<br/>
gob.<br/>
<br/>
		Many groups I have been in are amazed that one- I do not use<br/>
bellow :), two- <br/>
		that I can keep three song effects going.<br/>
<br/>
		But for the life of me I can not understand why they whine<br/>
so much when I <br/>
		say good night, lol.<br/>
