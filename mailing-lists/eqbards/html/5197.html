&gt; I must have missed it earlier but what are the stats on the battle drum?  I<br/>
&gt; think I remember reading that it increased your speed while playing Selos<br/>
&gt; but I haven&#39;t seen any other bonuses it confers.  What other songs does it<br/>
&gt; also improve?  <br/>

drum.  It also enhances the Rhythm series of songs<br/>
(percussion) by about 20% (e.g. +38 resist points becomes<br/>
+46).  I haven&#39;t tested it with other percussion songs.<br/>
