<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-259478208">I find it kind of disheartening to see all this attitude about GZ&#39;s answer<br/>
to the question Baelish asked him.   GZ didn&#39;t design the armor, the<br/>
equipment team did.  He asked them, they answered.  He didn&#39;t comment on<br/>
whether he agreed to it or not he just relayed their answer.  Jesus... don&#39;t<br/>
shoot the messenger guys.  GZ has always tried to at least answer us.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my thoughts, my oppinions are below.  They differ from others but<br/>
that&#39;s ok, we&#39;re all different.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Bards are not primary tanks.  Yes it would be _nice_ to have 3 or 4 more<br/>
AC but I&#39;m not going to stay up at night over it.<br/>
2)  Bards have ways of reducing their taunt level now (Song of dawn,<br/>
harmonic weapons)<br/>
3)  **************   GZ Doesn&#39;t design armor.  That&#39;s a different team<br/>
******************<br/>
4)  The singing steel BOOTS are AC 18.  It&#39;s not like their AC Sucks they&#39;re<br/>
still better than anything else we could get before, including imbrued.<br/>
5)  The &quot;Magic&quot; number for AC is about 800 AC.  After 800 there seems to be<br/>
a dramatic drop in the amount that you get hit.  With buffs it&#39;s even<br/>
better.  Right now a level 50 warrior can get their AC to about 800 maybe<br/>
900 with items.  We can get ours to about the same.  With singing steel I<br/>
will be able to get my AC (at 50th level) to over 900.  (Warriors may be<br/>
able to break 1000 with theirs)<br/>
<br/>
Why must we have the same ac as a warrior?  We can kite, they cant.  We can<br/>
Charm, they can&#39;t, we can reduce our taunt, they can&#39;t, we can run faster<br/>
than anything in the game, they cant.  We can heal, they can&#39;t, we can DoT,<br/>
they can&#39;t.  Umm I&#39;m gonna stop before that paragraph gets too long ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it wouldn&#39;t be nice to have more AC.  I&#39;m saying I&#39;m not<br/>
having a cow about a *slightly* lower AC.  Now, people complain that rangers<br/>
have higher ac than us.  I PLAY a Ranger.  They need AC about 10 times more<br/>
than we do.  I play a Ranger and a Bard and a Warrior.  Bard is my primary.<br/>
My warrior does ok.  My Ranger takes more dmg in any given fight than my<br/>
bard does, hands down.  They NEED that AC, they&#39;re a tank!<br/>
<br/>
Am I envious?  Sure!  Am I going to die if I don&#39;t get an extra 4 or 5<br/>
points of AC added onto my armor?  Nah.<br/>
<br/>
Now... the effects on the armor REALLY ticks me off.  So far every effect<br/>
they&#39;ve put on there are rarely needed, two of which (greaves and boots) we<br/>
have covered with forage anyway.  What I kind of wish is that they&#39;d give us<br/>
effects that we don&#39;t have songs for.... hmm ok maybe just give us effects<br/>
that we have songs we never use for ;)   (FYI I can&#39;t think of an effect<br/>
that we can&#39;t duplicate with our songs ;)  Invis Undead would be nice for<br/>
the boots though... god I&#39;m tired of begging for one.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... The armor is STILL Better than anything we could get _previously_<br/>
The only reason people are upset is because other classes are getting<br/>
_better_ ac on theirs.  Uhh  so what?  I&#39;m a bard.  I&#39;m proud to be a<br/>
bard...  And anything over 800AC is just bonus to me.  800 is the &#39;magic&#39;<br/>
number.  Ask any warrior.  The next really dramatic number is 900 and then<br/>
1000.<br/>
