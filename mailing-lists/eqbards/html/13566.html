&gt; you get into sort of a mindset of pull-kill, pull-kill, pull-kill.  Higher<br/>

  Discord, the leader of the Greenbloods(?) in Oggok whose name evades<br/>
  me... something like Sonooog.  Hell I love Oggok, I&#39;ve cleared most<br/>
  of the bouncers that people have never even heard of before.  I&#39;ve<br/>
  gone all the way to the bank to pull ogres heheehe. (most are green<br/>
  but the loot is good for buying soulstones ;)<br/>
<br/>
  Then again, I&#39;m enjoying the company of my friends much more now.<br/>
  The game has lost it&#39;s sparkle, but the friendships I&#39;ve made keep<br/>
  me coming back every night.<br/>
