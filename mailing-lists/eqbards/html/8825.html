<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910580544">I&#39;m not certain, but I think that corpses only go *poof* when the mob dies and the thing you&#39;ve<br/>
been charming to kill it is not currently charmed.  They check to see who did the most damage,<br/>
and since the thing that did the most is an unaligned NPC, *poof*.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s happened to me a couple of times, and only when I was in a group who were fighting the<br/>
&quot;other, soon to be dead&quot; mob.<br/>
