<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-198559974">hmm...i am sure everyone will have lots of good ideas....let me throw out some<br/>
ideas for possible new songs:<br/>
<br/>
1.  A Stun.  This would be awesome...but most likely broken since we need no<br/>
mana.<br/>
<br/>
2.  this one is a little bizarre..dunno if they can do it...a group Damage<br/>
Shield that has a 2ndary effect (example: a Lightning-based Damage shield<br/>
[shield of static? &lt;grin&gt;] that does X damage and the attacker has to save or<br/>
be stunned for 3 sec or something.)<br/>
<br/>
...i am big on the idea of a stun...<br/>
<br/>
3.  Bards need a party buff that directly adds to attack (ala grim aura, fire<br/>
fists)  .  Probably would do other stuff too...dunno how to present that as a<br/>
viable idea.<br/>
<br/>
4.  we&#39;re missing the 39 song?  How about a self-only vampiric regeneration<br/>
song...where heal like 10% of the damage we do( in melee).  dunno what the<br/>
efficiency would have to be to make the song useable...John(tm)?<br/>
<br/>
5.  Really bizarre...a flute based song...that summons a pet (preferably a<br/>
giant rat) that should be a reasonable power level (like the shaman pet...12+<br/>
levels behind shaman)  You could balance this by: making the song have to be<br/>
running continuous, with a 5 min repop on the button.  Or, have it drain mana<br/>
(like the shaman spell frenzy) and die when bard is at 0 mana.<br/>
...i was shooting for a pied piper type thing here.<br/>
<br/>
6.  I want an upgraded AE mez...with a built in DOT. &lt;Grin&gt;  It drops the dot,<br/>
and then they have to make their Mez save...ok this one is stupid...but it<br/>
sounded good before my morning coffee.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kaleid<br/>
23rd song Half elf bard<br/>
Glyphed Aegiss<br/>
27th level Dark Elf Magician and slayer of Travis Two Tone<br/>
(up to apprehensive in mistmoore...if i remember correctly)<br/>
&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>
Prexus<br/>
<br/>
PS. In reference to the mage-pet-root thread, we practically have 3 pets...the<br/>
air pet is horrendously awful.  No earth pet is the rule when there is a<br/>
neccesity for snare.  This does become complicated if the pet is the primary<br/>
tank...because the earth pet has 1.5X the hit points of the water pet and<br/>
probably 2.5X the fire pet.   But the general rule is to not use earth in<br/>
dungeons at all, or when snare is being cast...any magician should follow this<br/>
rule...the earth pet is the &quot;soloing&quot; pet basically.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
