<div id="ygrps-yiv-979134131">Heh, Two words John &quot;NO SITTING&quot; :)  The ping pong thing is a major pain in<br/>
the arse.  We did Dojorn last night, failed on the first attempt due to<br/>
pingponging (he was at a silver when the last tank fell).  We got him on the<br/>
second attempt.  I just love those cheating NPCs though, dual-wielding Lore<br/>
items, geeez :)   We are doing Hate tonight, I am hoping that they replaced<br/>
all the Clerics of Inny with Scorn Banshies :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was in Hate last night.  The Maestro was dual-wielding<br/>
&gt; Evensongs.  We almost got him the first time (down to &#39;Mae&#39;),<br/>
&gt; but then he started flying around attacking nukers, and<br/>
&gt; clerics who had sat down to med.  The melee folks couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; keep in range, and he actually lifetapped back up to &#39;Maest&#39;<br/>
&gt; as we died.  The second time I went LD just as the fight<br/>
&gt; started, and when I got back there were only 5 tanks left<br/>
&gt; standing with him at &#39;Maes&#39;.  Our damage wasn&#39;t enough to<br/>
&gt; overcome his lifetap and again he was gaining hp.  It was<br/>
&gt; almost 5 am at this point so we called it a night.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quad attacks for 150-250 hurt.  A couple tanks died within<br/>
&gt; 3 seconds of getting him aggroed on them.  Combined with his<br/>
&gt; AE lifetap and buggy pathing, he was actually harder than<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk (who is widely regarded as the most difficult<br/>
&gt; god/dragon at the moment).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would&#39;ve liked to have seen how Valoran (Rokenn&#39;s guild)<br/>
&gt; would do against him in this configuration.  Unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; there was a server reboot today.  Hopefully that will fix some<br/>
&gt; of the pathing and pet problems (we died to a pet train in<br/>
&gt; between the Maestro attempts).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dual wielding Evensongs...  Talk about too much of a good<br/>
&gt; thing...<br/>
