<div id="ygrps-yiv-279625887">Awesome!  That is a massive help!  Hehe..I&#39;m in my charming prime, and I<br/>
can&#39;t tell you how frustrating it is trying to click on the right<br/>
mob...especially when they look *exactly* the same!<br/>

Thanks!  That will be put in use tonight.  :)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Addition I use on Charm macro<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t posted in a while, but wanted to comment on charm macros.  Matt&#39;s<br/>
macro is good.  I will make a copy of it tonight.  Here it is again:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pet Assist&quot;<br/>
/pet back off<br/>
/assist &lt;main assist name&gt;<br/>
/pause 3<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the macro Matt has, I have one that also adds in /pet target<br/>
after /pet attack.  What /pet target does is retarget your pet so that if<br/>
you are charm kiting and you target another mob to get your charmed pet to<br/>
attack it, your original pet will be retargetted for recharms.  Those of us<br/>
that have recharmed the wrong mob by accident know that you end up with the<br/>
aggro of the original pet - not a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good luck in your travels,<br/>

<br/>
Charming in a group is the best thing to do on a 2 pull even if there is a<br/>
chanter.  Once you get good, the mob will be doing 90% of its damage on the<br/>
party&#39;s main target, 10% on you.  Thats a great tradeoff to 0-10% damage<br/>
done to chanter/healer and mana spent mezzing.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my &quot;pet assist&quot; hotkey, it works great.  Rule 1, let the group know<br/>
what you&#39;re doing, and make sure its ok with the enchanter.  Most are happy<br/>
for the mana you save them.  Type A enchanters will not be happy, so then<br/>
just let them mez the mob...<br/>
<br/>
Ok 2 Pull comes, assist the puller and find out what mob he is killing.<br/>
Target the non targeted mob and hit charm, once it sticks (very low resists<br/>
if you have a good CHA) hit the &quot;pet assist&quot; hotkey.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get this down its easy to weave 2 other songs while doing this...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pet Assist&quot;<br/>
/pet back off<br/>
/assist &lt;main assist name&gt;<br/>
/pause 3<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
<br/>
The pet back off is not necesaary, but seems to help.  Sometimes charms mobs<br/>
will still attack other party members or pets, the pet back off will prevent<br/>
this.  It also lets the party know what you have charmed, since your pet<br/>
will say something.  THe down side is the second or so of melee you lose<br/>
from your pet while he is waiting for the attack command.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, /pet back off, is probably the best mem blur spell in the<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
