<div id="ygrps-yiv-779683534">If you are the only bard on a (guessing) 30+ person raid, how is it so<br/>
vital when there are 4+ groups with no bard and thus no bard resists?<br/>
Is your group the last one standing and victorius?  Yes I am talking<br/>
end-game raids here.  If you are at the end-game and doing 30-60 person<br/>
raids and are level 60 or close to it, yes amassing that resist<br/>
equipment (and/or plat to buy it) is part of the deal.  Are you spending<br/>
all this time to camp seb or to go on raids?  All the time you refer to<br/>
involves getting those new items and plat and of course experience to go<br/>
on raids.  And I hope you have a jeweler friend in guild (I hope so with<br/>
110 people) or out that can help make the jewelery.  I just talked to a<br/>
jeweler friend I haven&#39;t seen in 4 months and he was more than happy and<br/>
willing to make me jewelery again.<br/>

Amassing 2500p excess is no incognizant task time wise.  Then; finding a<br/>
Jeweler who can craft the gear, and getting all those items you refer to<br/>
take a significant amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
Getting to 60 takes a significant amount of time.  My guild has about<br/>
110<br/>
people (probably quite a few of those have quit the game not sure<br/>
exactly)<br/>
Exactly three of those people are level 60.<br/>
<br/>
Again - you are arguing about game balance only from your perspective.<br/>
Maybe you are strictly speaking of specific types of raids (Waking the<br/>
sleeper?) - but I&#39;m talking about Planes, Siren&#39;s Grotto; Western<br/>
Wastes,<br/>
Dragon Necropolis - and hopefully ToV soon.  My guild does those<br/>
regularly<br/>
and we wish we had more than one bard (me) above 50...<br/>
<br/>
The bardic resist is VITAL to these raids for guilds like mine own.<br/>
