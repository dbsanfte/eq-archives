<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046037527">Well, not surprizingly, GZ is quite human.  One huge factor in programming<br/>
psychology is that you have to &quot;believe&quot; that there is a bug before you can<br/>
&quot;find&quot; the bug.  On some of the stuff, he believes.  On other stuff, it&#39;s<br/>
like he does not listen.  He has his mind made up and gives us the same old<br/>
answer he gave us before. Example: lullaby - he keeps telling us that high<br/>
level mobs have stronger resistence.  Fine.  But  he refuses to listen when<br/>
we say that level 5 gnolls are resisting in unusual ways.  It sure looks<br/>
like his mind is blocked on that one.  Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe we are hitting him with too many things at one time.  It sure<br/>
seems like he gets &quot;defensive&quot; and that does not help us make any progress<br/>
on those items.<br/>

p.s. last night I managed to get a clops and Tarsulk on me in Rathe Mts.<br/>
Kiting them around so my group could zone, I managed to drop either my<br/>
Ykesha or my MM drum (at the time I was not sure which one dropped.)  For a<br/>
split second, I thought about zoning but instead stopped and took a loc<br/>
before they smooshed me.  I yelled to my group to zone back in and go to the<br/>
loc and look on the ground for whatever I dropped.  Turned out to be my MM<br/>
drum and they found it!  WHEW!!!<br/>

Hello all,<br/>
I took the original post with all the questions about bards and delivered <br/>
them directy to Geoffrey Zatkin, the Arch-Mage of Norrath. He was kind <br/>
enough to reply with a very well thought-out response, which is below in <br/>
it&#39;s entirety.<br/>
