<div id="ygrps-yiv-70663206">I, too, had a blast at Gnomestock!  Thank you Aloro for setting this<br/>
silliness in motion.<br/>
<br/>
To my surprise, I found about 5 of my guild mates in Akanon already in Gnome<br/>
form ready to make the run when I showed up.  For some reason we all decided<br/>
to go PVP for the Event which meant no Ports or Binds, so when we died, it<br/>
was straight back to Steamfont.<br/>
<br/>
We ran from AkAnon to Lavastorm, with a boat ride in between.  Making noise<br/>
all the way, we were greeted for the most part by &quot;well wishers&quot; all along<br/>
the route.  Out of the six of us, only 3 made it to the Lava.  One of us<br/>
never made it on the boat.  One got wasted by a Stone Guardian at the<br/>
Nek/Lava border.  One bought it somewhere in Lavastorm.  I was lucky enough<br/>
to make the dive!  All in all, it was a great afternoon. My only regret?  I<br/>
didn&#39;t finish all the mead I had on me before I jumped.  What a waste!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;I actually managed to make it to the Temple of Solusek Ro ledge, where I<br/>
&gt;&gt;was able to fling myself into the lava along with perhaps twenty others<br/>
&gt;&gt;that I saw up there.  There was, sadly, a fair amount of attrition along<br/>
&gt;&gt;the way (not unexpected).  I tried to get back two more times, but kept<br/>
&gt;&gt;getting chomped by piranhas in the Nektulos river.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The first time I got et by a Fire Elemental about 3 feet from the<br/>
&gt;ledge.  The second time, however, I made it all the way.  And yes, Dark<br/>
&gt;Elves have no sense of Humour.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We should do this again sometime...<br/>
