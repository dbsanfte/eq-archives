<div id="ygrps-yiv-951881014">I play on two W2K systems, my home PC (Server) and my work notebook (Pro).<br/>
I have one nagging EQ problem that recently surfaced with the SB Live!<br/>
card. I&#39;ve reloaded it so many times I think it might be an interupt<br/>
problem. I also have seen a strange &quot;out of virtual memory...automatically<br/>
increasing resources...&quot; message every time I play. These only occur on<br/>
the SB system and only With EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the systems are rock solid and now work great with my iDSL<br/>
connection (was too far for ADSL). I just have to shut down EQ with Task<br/>
Mgr or reboot :(.<br/>

I run W2K and it is great :) not only do I have great performance from&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
the game, but I have a great platform to work from when not gaming<br/>
that&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
is solid as a rock.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; I am a &quot;little&quot; biased)<br/>
<br/>
I too had lots of problems with Windows ME as an upgrade to an&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
older box. (that box I updated to W2K Server and it runs great) I<br/>
received ME on a new box and have never had a single problem with it.<br/>
