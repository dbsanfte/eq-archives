<div id="ygrps-yiv-95606725">Usually if we get xp for the normal mobs, we can&#39;t take the named.  This was<br/>
a huge surprise the first time Soarin showed up and made mincemeat of our<br/>
group in short order.  We were already only getting xp for Quetzals and<br/>
Tanagers.  None of the casters could affect Soarin at all so a general<br/>
fleeing occurred.  Needless to say both bards were the first to die.  I<br/>
outran Soarin only to come over a rise and be stunned by a Quetzal.  The<br/>
other bard died before the &#39;RUN&#39; command could even be issued.<br/>

&gt; The spawns that kill me the most are the 20 minute spawns where the named<br/>
&gt; spawns as a rare spawn.  We have wasted weeks trying to get those.  Only a<br/>
&gt; few hours true, but that&#39;s weeks for us unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
My philosophy with those has been to hit them when you&#39;re the<br/>
right level to get experience for fighting in the area.  Then<br/>
you&#39;ll be having a good time, and if the named mob shows up,<br/>
he&#39;s just icing on the cake.<br/>
