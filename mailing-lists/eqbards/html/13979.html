&gt; &gt; True, but the root problem we were trying to solve was the<br/>
&gt; &gt; attractiveness of camping compared to crawling.  Nobody was<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to address high levels killing low level stuff until<br/>
&gt; &gt; you brought it up.  Like I said, the pro-crawling solutions we<br/>
&gt; &gt; came up with work - even your L50s in a L20 dungeon are<br/>
&gt; &gt; crawling instead of camping.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Really?  I thought the thread was entitled &quot;My overcrowding solution&quot; which<br/>
&gt; entalled crawling instead of camping :-).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People are lazy about changing the subject.  :)  I wasn&#39;t very<br/>
interested in the overcrowding thread, but someone made the<br/>
comment that they got a chance to play the game as Brad<br/>
intended - dungeon crawling.  Then I said crawling and camping<br/>
were mutually exclusive.  Then a bunch of people posted ideas<br/>
about how to make the game crawling-based instead of<br/>
camping-based, which is when I started putting (OT) on it.  <br/>
Sorry about not changing the subject line.<br/>
