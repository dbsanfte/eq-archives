<div id="ygrps-yiv-539052372">I think the only way around this is to make the events totally roleplaying so that<br/>
gm&#39;s controlling npc&#39;s can always have their invulnerability flag on.  have the events<br/>
have nothing to do with pc&#39;s killing npc&#39;s, make it a puzzle or a riddle to find a tool<br/>
that would help one gm controlled npc kill another gm controlled npc.<br/>

&gt;their level make them stupid.  I would have thought that Verant would have<br/>
&gt;found a way around this by now.  I can&#39;t imagine that the guides/gms don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;complain about it every time they run one.<br/>

&gt;I think the problem is the players.  I just think the gm&#39;s need to be given<br/>
&gt;a tool to allow them to more easily prevent the players from causing<br/>
&gt;problems.<br/>
&gt;One of the events I was at was clearly intended to provide quite a challenge<br/>
&gt;for 20 or more characters of 15th level or so.  However two 40+ characters<br/>
&gt;came in and killed 90% of the event npc&#39;s.  I say 90% because some might<br/>
&gt;have escaped their wrath, though I personally didn&#39;t see any.<br/>
