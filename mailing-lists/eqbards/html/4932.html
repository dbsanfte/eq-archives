<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184868363"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but with a group of people that high up in level<br/>
&gt; (up to 7 above you), isn&#39;t it true that you&#39;d get very little to no<br/>
&gt; experience from the fights? I remember when I was level 5 and my friend was<br/>
&gt; level 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting experience when we were<br/>
&gt; grouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that even when the<br/>
&gt; levels are closer, the people with the higher levels get more experience<br/>
&gt; than the lower levels regardless of who does the most damage. Of course if<br/>
&gt; you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I was just curious<br/>
&gt; if you got any experience from it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After some amount of experementation, I&#39;ve decided that the percent of<br/>
experience you get in a group is relative to your current xp total divided<br/>
by the total xp of the group.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this is not based on levels, but rather experience.  The net<br/>
implication of this is that grouped characters will level at the same rate<br/>
regardless of their individual experience penalty.  For instance, lets say<br/>
A Warrior who just reached 2nd level has 100 xp, and you (a Bard) have also<br/>
just reached 2nd.  Assume a 30% penalty - this means you have 130 xp.  If<br/>
the Warrior needs a total of 300 xp for 3rd, you will need a total of 390.<br/>
<br/>
Now you both go out an kill 460 xp worth of critters...  The Warror will<br/>
recieve 460 * (100 / (100+130)) = 200 xp, just enough to bring him to 3rd<br/>
and you will recieve 460 * (130 / (100+130)) = 260, just enough to get you to<br/>
3rd as well.<br/>
<br/>
Another implication of this is that grouping at low levels is very bad<br/>
for the low leveler...  Assume as a newbie you start with 1 xp.  Your<br/>
just-made-level-2 buddy might have 100 xp.  You are getting less than 1%<br/>
of the xp, while he is getting more than 99%.  This is with only a 1-level<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
At higher levels, this is less of a problem, and the ratio approaches 1/N<br/>
in a N-member party even for a spread of levels...<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I have no idea of the actual xp numbers required for each level<br/>
(I assume it&#39;s some sort of geometric progression) and only a vague idea<br/>
of what the racial and class penalties are, but I think the theory is<br/>
accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Another affect, which is probably the issue you ran into, is a hard level<br/>
limit on who gets xp.  At low levels, this is a 4-level limit (group members<br/>
4 levels less than the highest member get no xp).  At higher levels, this<br/>
spreads out to a wider range.  I assume this limit is there for antitwinking<br/>
(level 50 kills a critter while grouped with you and your tiny share of a<br/>
huge amount of xp gives you 5 levels...)<br/>
