<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042747267">Ok, I tried but I fail to resist the a reply to spell...<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that I am the MOST twinked bard here!!!  If anyone can beat<br/>
this, I&#39;d love to hear the story.<br/>
<br/>
I was given a virtually FULL SET OF BRONZE by a high level player I said<br/>
&quot;hi&quot; to and did the duck dance with.  I was like level 11 or so.  So much<br/>
bronze I can&#39;t wear it all without being encumbered.<br/>
<br/>
I almost said &quot;no, this is wrong...&quot; but instead I said &quot;wtf, this is the<br/>
coolest thing to ever happen to me in this GAME!&quot; Duh, yes it is a GAME!  <br/>
<br/>
Do I have fun? YES! <br/>
<br/>
Did it make me level faster? NO! (if for no other reason than the time spent<br/>
talking to people & the fact that a bandits hate bronze bards &quot;I can take<br/>
them, they are green trash. Opps, casters&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Does it make me look kewl? YES!<br/>
<br/>
Am I still learning how to be a bard? YES! <br/>
<br/>
Can other people get it at low levels? YES! (well maybe 11 is pretty low but<br/>
there is a direct relationship to your in-game knowledge and how long you<br/>
have been playing eq and your level if you do the normal amount of monster<br/>
killing.  sooner or later you figure out how to make as much money as you<br/>
want.  then if you get off your lazy butt and travel to where bronze is sold<br/>
- you can buy your bronze.  I have a friend who saw me in bronze and he went<br/>
off and got his - took him a couple weeks but he has it now.)<br/>
<br/>
Having fun in this game depends first and foremost on YOU!  I admit before I<br/>
knew much, I was very indignent about other char I would see who I thought<br/>
do not &quot;deserve&quot; to wear that armor (too good armor for low lev char)  But<br/>
truthfully, I did not understand the game well.  Now - all I can say is -<br/>
make it fun for you.  Don&#39;t hate others because you don&#39;t think something is<br/>
&quot;right&quot; about how they play the game.  It won&#39;t help you have more fun.<br/>
Remember - if it can be done, it will be done.  You may think Verant should<br/>
put in some limits on what level can have such and such stuffs.  But where<br/>
is the fun in that? Much of the crazy things that happen - happen because<br/>
there are so few rules.<br/>

p.s. &quot;did I leave my Chitin Shield in my dim pocket when I camped last<br/>
night? - it was 2.30am and I was real tired - I sure hope not&quot;<br/>

<br/>
		This is true, but if the twinked bards read this mailing<br/>
list, they would<br/>
		know how to play a bard :)<br/>
<br/>
		That was a thread here awhile back, why bards had such bad<br/>
reputations.  <br/>
		There were level 20 bards that didn&#39;t know how to twist or<br/>
thought that<br/>
		their <br/>
		healing song was the best thing that they could do for their<br/>
party.  Did<br/>
		they <br/>
			get that way because they were a twinked bard, or<br/>
just from lack of <br/>
			information?   I think it is more of the later.<br/>
