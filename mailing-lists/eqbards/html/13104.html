<div id="ygrps-yiv-822307994">Hehe - nothing like 75pp to get your attention! When you get a bit braver<br/>
you will find that you can shop at some other places as well.  I have gone<br/>
deeper in to buy fletching supplies and such.<br/>

I had never ever considered adventuring in Ogguk before (figuring it was<br/>
suicide) but am now looking forward to trying it again.  I&#39;m relatively<br/>
broke from buying all the gems for my lambent armor so figure Ogguk will be<br/>
a great place to build up my cash reserves. <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would pass this info along in case anyone wasn&#39;t aware of it.<br/>
