<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221880715">I would guess a few hundred points. It&#39;s been a while. I know I took 1 harm <br/>
touch just fine, and since I trained a 2nd one on me, would assume I got <br/>
hit twice. I believe I had at least 2 bubbles of health left after that <br/>
(full lambent at the time).<br/>

Nostrolo Tambourine Quest Checklist<br/>
<br/>
By Windleaf Mistsong, Red Sky, Bertoxxulous<br/>
With a couple of comments by Sylly Songsynger and -=B=- taken from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqbards@egroups.com">eqbards@egroups.com</a> list.<br/>
<br/>
Star of Odus Purchase for 105 pp (use your carillon) in jewel shop under<br/>
Erudin palace. Make sure you have an empty space in your main inventory.<br/>
Give Star of Odus to Wellford in Firiona Vie Bank and receive Tin Box with<br/>
6 slots. (I didn&#39;t have space and had to do this again. GM&#39;s won&#39;t help you.)<br/>
Coins (not in any particular order). Identify each with your Cataloging<br/>
Libretto:<br/>
<br/>
1) Torsis Ton -- Foraged in Emerald Forest<br/>
Best to have someone forage for you due to our limited forage skill<br/>
<br/>
2) Royal Crown of Dalnir -- Kly Implicator in Dalnir<br/>
It comes from the Library area, off of a Failed Crypt Raider. (-=B=-)<br/>
Kly Imprecator either on 2nd floor (church?) or 3rd floor down back<br/>
towrds the main Kly (dining room) in the lab on the left as you go in.<br/>
(Sylly Songsynger)<br/>
<br/>
3) Terraz Gon -- Failed Raider in Kaesora, behind library. Probably hardest<br/>
one to get.<br/>
Failed Crypt Raider near the library (4 or so &#39;names&#39; rotate thru the<br/>
library spawn cycle - if you dont see him the first time - stick around for<br/>
a couple hours or so and he pops eventually.) (Sylly Songsynger)<br/>
<br/>
4) Veksar Gran -- Bloodgill Goblins in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
Look at the base of the pillars around the center of the lake. (-=B=-)<br/>
<br/>
5) Danak Gran -- Scorpoid Scrounger in The Overthere<br/>
Go in invis and track a scrounger who is down in ravine. After you hit<br/>
him, get invis back up and lead him out of ravine (really helps to have<br/>
SOW). I accidentally brought up another scorpion, but I charmed scrounger<br/>
and had him kill it. Then fear/chained scrounger to death. They do harm<br/>
touch, but I was able to do this as a 35 bard.<br/>
<br/>
6) Ik Gran -- Captain of the Guard from City of Mist<br/>
Obtainable if you are in a group by the zone.<br/>
Combine Tin Box and return to Wellford for Tambourine!<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
You can buy the coins from players. Just be polite and don&#39;t spam the zone<br/>
with requests. I usually would do just one request when I entered the zone<br/>
as a courtesy to others. You can frequently get the coins for free if you<br/>
are polite. However, for the Kaesora coin, I was gladly offering to pay<br/>
50pp as hardly anyone was ever in Kaesora on Bertox server, and when there<br/>
were people in Kaesora, a lot of times it was people from a Japanese<br/>
guild. On other servers with lots of Kaesora hunters, you should get this<br/>
easily). ---Windleaf<br/>
