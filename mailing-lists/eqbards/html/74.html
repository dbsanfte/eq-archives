<div id="ygrps-yiv-851354734">I&#39;m all for roleplaying, but let me add my $.02 here (2 copper?)<br/>
Though I do not fall into the following characterization, not all<br/>
bards must roleplay a jovial singer of sweetness and light.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s perfectly possible to have a bard who&#39;s a scoundrel and<br/>
a rogue!  One who puts his thief skills to actual use, for example.<br/>
A charming bard could make a wonderful confidence man (or woman)<br/>
... and while the &quot;good&quot; bards certainly wouldn&#39;t like what he&#39;s doing,<br/>
that wouldn&#39;t necessarily keep him (her) from doing it.<br/>
<br/>
We are, after all, not paladins.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Hail, fellow bards.  I am Pistov, a 10th level Bard currently residing<br/>
&gt;in the metropolis of Freeport in the world of Cazic-Thule.  I have been <br/>
&gt;listening to all of the fine discussion by all, and like any bard worth<br/>
&gt;his lute strings, I have a few things to say as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    First of all, regarding charging for locating a corpse, think of it<br/>
&gt;this way.  Bards, Shadow Knights, and Necromancers are the only classes <br/>
&gt;who have this talent.  Charging for this service seems a greedy and<br/>
&gt;selfish act, much more suited to those evil undead mongers, I would say.  <br/>
&gt;We as bards work best in a group, and the more friends we have the better.<br/>
&gt;Locating a corpse for free has made me many a travelling partner.  Coming<br/>
&gt;from one who was a wizard in a past life, it is FAR easier for us to sing <br/>
&gt;the song of speed and run in a straight heading to locate a corpse than it<br/>
&gt;is to wander around, lost, at a normal run searching fruitlessly.  <br/>
&gt;Performing this task for free gives all bards a good name.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Another thing I wanted to mention.  I myself tire of seeing a Dark Elf<br/>
&gt;Necromancer, a Troll Warrior, and a High Elf Paladin all in the same party.  <br/>
&gt;Please, try to role play at least a little.  Bards are well suited to<br/>
&gt;promoting role playing, since by our nature we are highly social.  It is <br/>
&gt;easy enough to make a few hotkeys that add a little flavor to the game.<br/>
&gt;Consider this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pistov shouts, &#39;10 Bard wanting to join group for dervish hunting.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OR<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pistov shouts, &#39;I grow weary of singing to myself, I need an audience!  If<br/>
&gt;you would care to listen to a 10th level bard, please give a tell.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I guarantee you will have more success with the latter.  And it really<br/>
&gt;promotes good role playing.  We as bards should be good examples for others <br/>
&gt;to follow.  Try it, and I am sure you will begin to have much more fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fare well, all, and may the muses bless you!  Perhaps some of us may meet<br/>
&gt;some day!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pistov<br/>
