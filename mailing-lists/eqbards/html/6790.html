<div id="ygrps-yiv-891042828">While I understand Richard&#39;s grievance (about high-level characters <br/>
killing the guards that newbies rely on for safety), I make the following <br/>
counterargument:<br/>
<br/>
As a low-level Half-Elven Bard, I thought it would be fun to explore a <br/>
new area (since my group seemed stuck in North Ro) and I wandered into <br/>
the Nektulos forest.  I reached a fork in the road and spotted a <br/>
presumably friendly guard.  Wham!  I&#39;m dead.  I return to get my corpse. <br/>
No guards in sight.  Wham! I&#39;m dead.  I return again.  Wham!  I return a <br/>
fourth time.  Wham!  Frankly, anytime I can kill a Nektulos guard now, I <br/>
feel they deserve it!<br/>

&gt; OK,<br/>
&gt; BEFORE this gets KABONG&#39;d..and it will, no doubt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have hit on my PERSONAL PET PEEVE.  NOTHING annoys<br/>
&gt; my more than level 50 people, bored, sitting in Newbie<br/>
&gt; zones and killing the guards there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night, there was a level 50 Warrior sitting in<br/>
&gt; Rivervale killing the Town guards.  Not the Wall<br/>
&gt; guards, where the average player who runs to them is<br/>
&gt; level 5 to 12, but the town ones...where the only<br/>
&gt; players running to them is around level 1 to 3.<br/>
&gt; I spent 2 hours helping every newbie I could there<br/>
&gt; (with my Cleric, so I could heal them).  Its hard<br/>
&gt; enough for a newbie to start on older servers, without<br/>
&gt; high level IDIOTS making things tougher on them for a<br/>
&gt; lark (NOTE:  It was on MM, and No, it was NOT<br/>
&gt; Shada...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone kills the Inky guards in Nek forest.  That<br/>
&gt; must make life Soooo fun for the New Dark Elf players.<br/>
&gt;  All I&#39;m asking is that you THINK about your actions<br/>
&gt; BEFORE you do something that may have such an impact.<br/>
