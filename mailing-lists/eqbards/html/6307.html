<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616898788">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you have a good idea of what it&#39;s possible to do in<br/>
a game with a computer.<br/>
It&#39;s not the reality and you are stop by the limit of this computer.<br/>
A massivly multiplayer game which is dynamic, with thousand of <br/>
monster and player.<br/>
Yes perhaps you could have it, in 2010 or 2020 ...<br/>
And I don&#39;t talk about programmers who will have to implement this.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget the limits my friends ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But that is not the answer - Verant - wake up and make the high level world<br/>
&gt;Dynamic!  Keep track of the monsters and make them get harder and meaner or<br/>
&gt;have better AI depending on how well the last fights were.  If Thulaak,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;slays a dragon - make the next one have better guards - or spawn in<br/>
&gt;different place with badder stuffs - Make the Planes be dynamic<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;- that have dynamic AI for battling these lev 50&#39;s.  And if you can do this<br/>
&gt;in code - you wont have to spend so much resources  coding and arting new<br/>
