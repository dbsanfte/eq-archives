<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357168374">my experience so far was only in guk.  in upper guk, crocs and spiders could<br/>
be chained, but i couldn&#39;t chain any live frogs.  i was in the fountain room<br/>
going after the scryer and i couldn&#39;t chain anything.  the whole room is<br/>
filled with shaman, so the SoW theory has some validity.  in lower guk, i<br/>
had no problem chaining ghoul frogs.  my 43+ bard friends experience the<br/>
same thing with different mobs, such as has been described in solusek B.  i<br/>
petitioned and of course the guide had no info, and figures they broke<br/>
something again with the patch monday morning, which started these chain<br/>
problems.  he didn&#39;t know of an intentional change, not like that helps<br/>
coming from a guide.  so i /bugged it.<br/>
