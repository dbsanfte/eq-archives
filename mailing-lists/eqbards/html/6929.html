&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe it is, but it is medium sized only, so humans<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and half elves only.  It uses the chain model.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The odd thing is, high elves and wood elves are supposed to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to wear medium armor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, but there are some items that I refer to as &quot;&lt;whatever&gt; sized only&quot; which<br/>
&gt; really means &quot;only races that can wear size &lt;whatever&gt; only&quot;.  There are several<br/>
&gt; examples actually, though usually a size small issue, like the kaladim scarab<br/>
&gt; armour which is &quot;small size only&quot; (halflings dwarves and gnomes only).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Makes sense (actually it doesn&#39;t make physical sense, but it<br/>
does make logical sense :-).  Kinda reminds me of the highway<br/>
signs above a lane that say &quot;Exit Only.&quot;  Does that mean that<br/>
lane will only exit the highway (i.e. the next lane over may<br/>
exit as well), or does it mean only that lane exits the<br/>
highway (i.e. the next lane over cannot exit).<br/>
