<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385983387">I saw a fellow selling a red and green dragon scale in ec one day, promptly<br/>
asking him why in Tunare&#39;s great Norrath would he do that? He was looking<br/>
for a Mryolkar (sp?) BP. I thought to myself of course, don&#39;t we all?<br/>
(sarcasm)<br/>
<br/>
He told me that while passing through EJ one day, he was observing a guild<br/>
getting smeared by Severilious. It was actually a close battle, so he said.<br/>
I suppose their last dragon hunter fell to the ground, he walked up and<br/>
nuked (not on his rogue) the poor cute little dragon to its death. Lo and<br/>
behold, 2 dragonscales. I have no idea what he decided to do with the other<br/>
items that dropped, if any. But I suppose it does happen in some far off<br/>
galaxies sometimes. Bards never get solo dragon kills :-( hehe</div>
