<div id="ygrps-yiv-123718757">Actually FBR is Flowing Black Robe.  I don&#39;t think we should get too worked <br/>
up with the acronyms usage.  There are really not too many of them.  RTS <br/>
stands for Runed Totem Staff, it is also pretty common.  Here are a few <br/>
common EQ acronyms for anyone who wants to know:<br/>
<br/>
OOM - Out of Mana<br/>
AFK - Away from Keyboard<br/>
BRB - Be Right Back<br/>
OMW - On My Way<br/>
GTG - Good to Go<br/>
LOL - Laugh Out Loud<br/>
OOC - Out of Character<br/>
SG - Sand Giant<br/>
HG - Hill Giant<br/>
LJ - Lockjaws<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m going to join the flame list and say that I agree with Bob.  I receive <br/>
&gt;over<br/>
&gt;200 messages a day from several mailing lists, family, friends.  I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;any idea what most of these acronyms are and when I find them in a message <br/>
&gt;I am<br/>
&gt;curious as to what they mean, but as before mentioned, I still have 200 or <br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt;messages to read.  This leaves me little time to reply to people, let alone <br/>
&gt;go<br/>
&gt;to a web site with an EverQuest dictionary.  Nor do I contain any desire to <br/>
&gt;go<br/>
&gt;there and look up a word each time.<br/>
&gt;      Here&#39;s a good one for you, everyone pretty much knows what a zipper <br/>
&gt;is, or<br/>
&gt;has one on a least one article of clothing, but when i told my 10 year old<br/>
&gt;nephew to XYZ-PDQ he had no clue what I was talking about.  In other words,<br/>
&gt;just because I play the game doesn&#39;t mean I know every piece of language <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;lore about it, nor do I care to.<br/>
&gt;      But it would be nice if people would just spell out what it is they <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;talking about, it would make me more interested in the messages that <br/>
&gt;contain<br/>
&gt;these acronyms.<br/>

&gt;p.s. I DO know what FBR is...Full Black Robe.  But I guess that is just <br/>
&gt;because<br/>
&gt;for the last 5 days some idiot has been screaming it across east karana, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;each time he does some person new to the area, generally barbarians, will <br/>
&gt;shout<br/>
&gt;back...&quot;What is a FBR?&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Ah! You just need the secret decoder ring. Here ya go:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry, wrong answer.  Doesn&#39;t scale.  Barely works at all.  Using <br/>
&gt;acronyms<br/>
&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t widely known is inconsiderate of those with whom you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposedly trying to communicate.  Pointing people to an immense list of<br/>
&gt; &gt; definitions is simply a way of saying you can&#39;t be bothered to type out<br/>
&gt; &gt; words that would be relatively sufficient.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM systems <br/>
&gt;difficult<br/>
&gt; &gt; and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; companies moved away from secret code.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Acronyms are the rudest form of slang and jargon.  They are even worse <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt; &gt; obscure words like &quot;proc&quot; because they aren&#39;t even pronouncable words.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Acronyms are effectively a way to invent new words on the fly, then use<br/>
&gt; &gt; them and berate the reader for not knowing what they mean.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll warn you now that I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; industry for 30 years, with some success.  People either get the point <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; behave less rudely or miss the point and continue to speak in secret <br/>
&gt;code,<br/>
&gt; &gt; either not understanding or simply not caring whether they&#39;re <br/>
&gt;communicating<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the majority of their audience.  If you don&#39;t mind if the majority <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the readers simply don&#39;t know what you meant and probably won&#39;t bother <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find out, use them, but don&#39;t kid yourself.<br/>
