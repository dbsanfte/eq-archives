<div id="ygrps-yiv-507058457">It all depends on where you are. If you live around Qeynos go to<br/>
Splitpaw. Great exp, not many people to steal kills(but trains suck<br/>
therefore), and good money. If you live in Rivervale, either get a group<br/>
of 4-5 people around your level(you&#39;d prolly want higher levels) and<br/>
either hunted in Beholder(gorge minos, mudites, and chasm minotaurs<br/>
depending on group level, and how many), or in Highpass, which, though<br/>
it doesn&#39;t have great money, is a great way to gain exp. I would say it<br/>
has great money, as the Polished Granite Tomahawks have gone for as much<br/>
as 300pp on Solusek Ro, but jerk high level people tend to farm the spot<br/>
around the spawn time(its not too random). If you live in Freeport<br/>
either hunt dervish Cutthroats, head to Guk, or go into the Oasis if its<br/>
not crowded(which is not often). If you live in Faydwer, try Unrest or<br/>
Crushbone, though they both have many trains and are very crowded.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a lvl 15 bard and i&#39;m looking for a great place to make a lot of<br/>
&gt; cash, plus get some exp.  Do any of you higher lvl bards know of a<br/>
&gt; good place.  I need the cash to start upgrading my armor and to buy a<br/>
