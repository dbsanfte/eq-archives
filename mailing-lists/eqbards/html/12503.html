<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678010626">Well, stuns do have their uses.  However, Togors is much more efficent <br/>
Manawise.  Sure you can chain stun a mob into submission, but at a <br/>
staggering mana cost.<br/>
<br/>
Our slowdowns do not affect casting time in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, a lot of fights are counted in seconds at lower levels.  However when <br/>
you start fighting mobs that double attack for 120 and have 8,000 hit points, <br/>
slowdowns are increasingly nessecary.  A Mob with Togors is like hitting <br/>
them with a continuous six second stun for 175 mana.<br/>
<br/>
I would not trade Togors for anything.  Most valuable spell in a Shaman&#39;s <br/>
Medicine Bag.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I still chuckle to myself as I watch shamans spend half the fight<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to slow the target, at which time the wizard stands up and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; finishes it off in 10 seconds.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Togors is incredible if it sticks.  I mean, wow... thing is<br/>
&gt; &gt;   barely moving.  hehe.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh.  The faster you can kill a mob, the less important<br/>
&gt; slowdowns become.  Anyone know if it affects casting rate?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stuns OTOH are more a means of damage control, rather than<br/>
&gt; reduction.  That makes them more like heals and rune - they<br/>
&gt; are still valuable even if it takes only 10 seconds to kill a<br/>
&gt; mob.<br/>
