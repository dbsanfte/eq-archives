<div id="ygrps-yiv-438689988">I was running around in Lake of Ill Omen at one of the undead areas.  In a<br/>
matter of around 4 hours I had managed to gain almost 3 full bubbles of xp<br/>
which was enough to get me into level 25.  This was with a group of a Necro,<br/>
a shaman, 2 druids and 2 bards.  The shaman and one of the druids seemed to<br/>
know nothing about healing and the shaman eventually left.  So now I have<br/>
just a tad over 3 bubbles until Fear!!<br/>

My guild mates who are a tad higher level than me (45-48) prefer to hunt<br/>
Hornets in Burning Wood - but I seem to attract them like flies on<br/>
(you-know-what) and seem to die at least once every attempt - so I leave<br/>
them to that while I get &quot;Pick-up&quot; Groups (in quotes because it&#39;s become<br/>
pretty regularly who I&#39;ve been grouping with) at the North Wall...</div>
