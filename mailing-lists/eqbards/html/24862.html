<div id="ygrps-yiv-665067970"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; the one from BW is from nezekezema/phurzicon spawn, a <br/>
&gt; boring as hell camp that takes too much firepower to <br/>
&gt; ward off the wanderers.  I hope none of you have a <br/>
&gt; mage friend that needs the burning embers.  Camping <br/>
&gt; his spawn point, We&#39;ve had about 20 guts drop at least, <br/>
&gt; 1 shoulder piece and finally the embers for the mage <br/>
&gt; epic.  your shoulders are quite rare.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I found the Tattered Mantle to be a very common drop -- you <br/>
just need to hunt Gull. The last time I was in there, ever person in <br/>
the group left with them.<br/>

Maybe we were just lucky? *Grins*<br/>
