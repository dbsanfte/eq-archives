We&#39;re vaguely neighbors.  I live in Wilton, New Hampshire.  I&#39;m 51, father<br/>
of 2 sons and I have 3 grandchildren.  I more or less play any musical<br/>
instrument I can get my hands on, with specialty in guitar, trombone,<br/>
banjo, and learning piano.  One of my sons plays EverQuest and the other<br/>
will eventually, but I&#39;ll leave it up to them to reveal themselves (they&#39;re<br/>
not here).<br/>
<br/>
My characters do tend to be a bit paternalistic.  :-)}<br/>
