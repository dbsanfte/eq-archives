<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851077755">If you get charmed, click on your sit/stand button over and over, as many<br/>
times as you can.  This will keep you from &#39;walking into his lair&#39; until the<br/>
charm wears off.  while you are sitting/standing, you don&#39;t move, or attack,<br/>
which is good :).  However, other beasties can get in free attacks on you<br/>
tho... and you can&#39;t fight back until the charm wears off :(<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; If you do decide to venture in deeper, try to avoid going too<br/>
&gt; far in (especially the far left passage).  Meldrath (a L53<br/>
&gt; necromancer I hear) lives inside and casts some nasty spells<br/>
&gt; on you through the walls.  The worst, which thankfully has<br/>
&gt; never happened to me, is charm, at which point you will<br/>
&gt; merrily waltz into his lair to die, leaving your corpse<br/>
&gt; unrecoverable.<br/>
