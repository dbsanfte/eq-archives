<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bard Petition (LONG) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-940797269">Typically I have stayed out of these sorts of issues and kept myself a<br/>
passive observer - I did vote on the last petition and I do think our class<br/>
could use a little fixing up on a few issues though.  For the most part I<br/>
find the Bard a tremendously enjoyable and challenging character to play<br/>
with few complaints.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, I keep noticing subtle changes in the game where it appears<br/>
that our class is actually being NERFED instead of having some of the long<br/>
standing problems fixed, and this is why I am speaking up.  I have played a<br/>
Bard solidly for 4 months happily, and I wonder why at level 22 I suddenly<br/>
miss notes regularly on low level songs I have had for a long time, and I am<br/>
a &quot;Master&quot; at all my instrument skills.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the Bard was too powerful in beta and had to be nerfed somewhat,<br/>
but it seems to be continuing.  Is this innocent mistakes that get<br/>
introduced into the code with patches or is this secret nerfing that Verant<br/>
does not want us bards to know about since we would pitch a major fit if we<br/>
did know?<br/>
<br/>
My invisibility song has always worked against undead, but last night in<br/>
Unrest it seemed that all the mobs I ran past saw right through it and<br/>
proceeded to attack me none the less - this has NEVER happened to me before<br/>
in Unrest, unless of course I blinked visible for a moment, which I did not<br/>
do last night when these things happened.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my class change rants:<br/>
<br/>
1. Do not cap our skills so low, like forage (40), and sneak (70) - absurd.<br/>
Raise the caps.<br/>
<br/>
2. Fix our broken songs - there are some that do not appear to do anything<br/>
(Disenchanting Melody) and others that are silly (random short distance<br/>
teleport that tends to put you in a basement of a zone or at the bottom of<br/>
the ocean - I waited 21 levels to get that?)<br/>
<br/>
3. Do something about the Z-axis bug - I don&#39;t care how well sound travels,<br/>
it does not travel through several feet of earth and stone into a basement,<br/>
thereby drawing out uber-mobs who are hell-bent on destroying the bard, and<br/>
generally do so before he knows what hit him (often then don&#39;t even need to<br/>
leave the basement to do it!).<br/>
<br/>
These I see are the main issues, but I also wanted to add that we have<br/>
chosen to play the Verant Bard class, which I think is designed for<br/>
grouping.  It is very very hard to solo with a bard and we do our best work<br/>
in a group.  You have to like that, and you have to play your character and<br/>
understand it to get the most benefit from it.  It is hard sometimes to be<br/>
satisfied with some of our abilities because we get a little taste of so<br/>
many different kinds that so many other specialized classes do so much<br/>
better than us at them.  The mobs are always greener on the other side of<br/>
the zone.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone cares, my other opinions are interspersed below.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From: &quot;Judson Sapp&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:JudsonSapp@...">JudsonSapp@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I read a post about starting back up the bard petition.  I <br/>
&gt; for one do not<br/>
&gt; like petitions but for some strange reason that seems to be <br/>
&gt; the way to get<br/>
&gt; things fixed with this game.  So I wrote the original writer <br/>
&gt; of the Bard<br/>
&gt; petition and he wrote me back saying &quot;If you rally some <br/>
&gt; people to make new<br/>
&gt; comments, I will overhaul it and submit it to Brad&quot;.  The <br/>
&gt; ball is in our<br/>
&gt; court so I was hoping to see a bunch of new comments on <br/>
&gt; things we would like<br/>
&gt; to have fixed or changed with the class.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a personal note my Bard character is my favorite to play, <br/>
&gt; and believe it<br/>
&gt; or not on the Magician mailing list everyone there complained <br/>
&gt; a lot more<br/>
&gt; about there class.  I have to say though that my Mage <br/>
&gt; character was a lot<br/>
&gt; more balanced than my bard.  And yet they keep helping the <br/>
&gt; Mages out by<br/>
&gt; fixing their complaints.  Maybe the squeaky wheel does get oil.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Suggestions:  As my bard is still new I can offer only a few <br/>
&gt; ideas to get<br/>
&gt; the ball rolling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  <br/>
&gt; My idea is<br/>
&gt; change the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to <br/>
&gt; me (Stats<br/>
&gt; might be the factor) to be the better song to use over <br/>
&gt; Warsong and Anthem.<br/>
&gt; I have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, <br/>
&gt; there should be<br/>
&gt; no debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, but I also think these are trivial compared to some of the other<br/>
issues we should be focusing on getting fixed.  At least Chant and Anthem DO<br/>
something useful, never mind the fact that they are somewhat similar in<br/>
nature - that is a whole different thread.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think since it is possible with low lag to successfully weave 3 songs<br/>
(some people say 4) but that when lag is introduced it drops to 2 due to<br/>
factors out of the players control, and also the fact that constantly<br/>
weaving is difficult on the hands, we should get the ability to have some<br/>
kind of automatic weaving mechanism.  Still, there are other things about<br/>
the character that are bugged worse than this - which is not really a<br/>
bug-fix request when it comes right down to it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding <br/>
&gt; like the rouges<br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I absolutely agree, why should we not?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a <br/>
&gt; role-playing stand<br/>
&gt; point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it <br/>
&gt; also, so flip a<br/>
&gt; coin.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Binding sure would be nice, but standing firm on that issue makes me uneasy<br/>
as I feel like I am whining for Verant to help me come to terms with my own<br/>
laziness or impatience to deal with the 5 minutes or so it takes to run back<br/>
to my corpse.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was <br/>
&gt; not using a<br/>
&gt; crossbow or bow?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bards would use a crossbow if this game had them, at least in the historical<br/>
role-playing sense.  I&#39;m not sure a bow is appropriate, though.  We can<br/>
either equip our instruments and stand back (in which case we cannot use the<br/>
bow unless we unequip and stand back) or we can jump in the melee (in which<br/>
case we would not use the bow) so I think it is kind of moot to press this<br/>
one.  We already get a nice variety of skills from all the different classes<br/>
as it is - I say make the skills we have reach higher caps.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only <br/>
&gt; weapons that can be<br/>
&gt; used as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of<br/>
&gt; singing songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a <br/>
&gt; lot of ideas<br/>
&gt; here would help.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting idea, paladins get swords like Ghoulbane and we get instruments<br/>
like the Battle Drum.  As far as melee goes, we get such a variety of<br/>
choices in our weapons that I don&#39;t really care about a class-specific<br/>
weapon.  We can use weapons that only mage types can use (like the Staff of<br/>
Writhing) so I&#39;m not so concerned about this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope this gets the ball rolling and as viewed as a <br/>
&gt; constructive way to<br/>
&gt; help solve some bard issues.<br/>

&gt; Fair thee well friends!<br/>
