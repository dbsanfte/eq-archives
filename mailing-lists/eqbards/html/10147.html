<br/>
This is how I understand it:  Every time your primary weapon swings, you<br/>
make a dual wield skill check.  IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT THE DELAY IS<br/>
ON THE WEAPON YOU HAVE IN YOUR SECONDARY HAND.. Many people I know use a<br/>
really low delay weapon in their primary and the higher damage, higher<br/>
delay weapon in their secondary, because they&#39;ll get that many more<br/>
chances to swing.<br/>
<br/>
If I were you, I&#39;d put at least 5 or 10 practice points into dual wield,<br/>
as with any other skill it goes up VERY slowly at first.  Once you hit 50<br/>
or so you&#39;ll watch it go up a LOT quicker.<br/>
<br/>
At 23, I&#39;m using a PGT in my primary hand and a Barbed Leather Whip in my<br/>
secondary, that is when I&#39;m not using all-instrument attack.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got my first piece of Lambent today! :)  Thanks to my roommate and a<br/>
guildmate who gave me a lambent stone, I got one Lambent bracer, which<br/>
will be my ONLY lambent for a long time, I&#39;m sure, till I can start<br/>
getting the components myself :)<br/>

&gt; Hello Bards and friends,<br/>
&gt;    Seeing that I&#39;m nearing lvl 17, i was curious about a few things <br/>
&gt; really...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) What is a good strategy to use while dual weilding?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) I&#39;m currently equipped with a PGT (dmg 6 del 24, berserker str proc wt 6) <br/>
&gt; and SBS (shield of course will go bye bye), and a Pugius Dagger (dmg 5 del <br/>
&gt; 21 wt 2.?) which I use to hone my piercing skills after the PGT has already <br/>
&gt; proc&#39;d. [BTW, i realize that proc means cast, but what does it stand for or <br/>
&gt; mean? =)] So will weilding both of these drain my stamina too quickly you <br/>
&gt; think?<br/>
