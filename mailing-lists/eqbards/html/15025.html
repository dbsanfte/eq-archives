Ghoul Lord drops the Yk sword on the dead side.  Froglok King drops the<br/>
Mitheral-thing (2hs) on the live side.  Both drop fairly nice hats (GL=Skull<br/>
Shaped BBQ; FK=Crown of same; good resist items)<br/>
<br/>
Me, still killing spectators & Cyndy too when I have some help.  2 full bubs<br/>
into 46 and grinding.  Possible visit to the alter-Plane: Fear tonight.<br/>
Maybe should have gone in last night but we killed specs, specs, specs.  And<br/>
then me and my rogue fiend Murdok, headed over to CazicThule the zone.  I<br/>
wanted to see if I could beg, borrow or steal a Liz scale cloak (quest item<br/>
for my wizard character.)  Dok showed me the &quot;upper tae room&quot; - of course he<br/>
was hoping for some Ravenscale.<br/>
<br/>
I used lament to selectively pull and we cleared our way in.  Woo Hoo!  A<br/>
couple of those crazy Justicators gave xp to me at 46!  One or two were blue<br/>
cons as well!  I was wishing I had the mana drain song loaded - damn healer<br/>
lizards.  But I used Pixie to interrupt and Chant of Frost to DoT and 2YK<br/>
for dd.  Dok was rather proficient at applying back stabs and we prevailed.<br/>
<br/>
At one point, his BS was so effective the loz was frenzied on him and had<br/>
him to half health.  So, I told Dok to wait a sec and charmed the Justi.<br/>
&quot;My leader is Sylly!&quot;  Yea, and now your gonna pay for it!  Of course when<br/>
charm broke, he was focused on me and Dok BS&#39;d him to death.<br/>
<br/>
We only stayed thru one Stone Golem spawn.  A potion?  Who are they kidding?<br/>
It would take a strong effort for a even con group to get that room and the<br/>
prize is a potion?  &lt;sheesh&gt; I guess it&#39;s not the good drop but really.  So,<br/>
we shouted the room was open and made our way out.  I still have yet to see<br/>
the AoF room in CT.  On my list of things to do...<br/>

&gt; Hi, Sylly!  Guess what?  I&#39;m now 2YKS compliant!  And get this story:  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; invited into the Lord room.  As I arrive I get a tell from a group member<br/>
&gt; &quot;Guess what we got you yesterday?&quot;.  Turns out it&#39;s a YKS.  10 minutes<br/>
later<br/>
&gt; the Lord spawns.  I roll a 96.  2 YKS in 10 minutes, kinda cool, huh?<br/>
hehe<br/>

&gt; PS - If it&#39;s the King and not the Lord, sue me.  What do I care what<br/>
they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; called if they&#39;re dead?  As long as they have a YKS on them!  ;)<br/>
