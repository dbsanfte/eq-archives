<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932610382">Have a little faith in your bard friend.  I myself was stuck at 15 and 16<br/>
for quite a while.  I don&#39;t know it seems like the a big speedbump in your<br/>
leveling progress.  Once you make 17 things start rolling again.  That&#39;s<br/>
where I am at now.  The best suggestion is to make sure yur twisting in<br/>
Unrest and group as much as you can.  Even a single partner makes the two<br/>
of you very effective.  I got to level 16 partnering with my lvl 15 druid<br/>
friend.<br/>
