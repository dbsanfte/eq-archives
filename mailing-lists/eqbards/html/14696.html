&gt; who claimed he<br/>
&gt; &quot;lost his corpse&quot;.  This WAS a bard - so I don&#39;t see how he <br/>
&gt; could have lost<br/>
&gt; the corpse.  I would have considered helping him (perhaps he <br/>
&gt; fell asleep or<br/>
&gt; something) - but with a character name of &quot;Pimpicious&quot; or <br/>
&gt; some such - I<br/>
&gt; decided not to bother...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yea, lots of beggars lately. One beggar got me just as I entered Everfrost<br/>
zone. He eventually begged from my partner as well. Seems he was going down<br/>
the entire list of people in the zone. This was no brand-new, clueless<br/>
player begging for stuff.<br/>
<br/>
To keep this bard related, I did have a level 1 bard &quot;inspect&quot; me at the<br/>
bank and then start begging stuff from me. I told him I&#39;d be happy to give<br/>
him any advice, but he started the &quot;please, please, please&quot; replies for<br/>
equipment. He started giving me grief after I refused to give him equipment<br/>
and I ended up &quot;ignoring&quot; him. In the future, I will not respond to any beg<br/>
requests, which is sad as I do like to help those who truly need the help.<br/>
<br/>
I give my older equipment to younger guild members, or sometimes to newbies<br/>
who are actually hunting and working hard. I&#39;ve always appreciated other<br/>
players giving me stuff or buffing me when I&#39;m out there hacking away at<br/>
rats with my new characters. I really loved it when a level 50 magician<br/>
started casting lava shield on me as a level 5 druid. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always happy to give advice or strategies and, of course, locating<br/>
corpses.<br/>
