could practice conjuration before level 30 - my two ranger<br/>
friends spent something like two weeks meditating every chance<br/>
they got so they could fizzle their L30 DoT 20 times for every<br/>
1 success hoping it would raise their conjuration from however<br/>
many practice points they were willing to sacrifice for it.<br/>
<br/>
And you are kidding yourself if you think it doesn&#39;t add to<br/>
their combat ability much.  Snare&#39;s use is obvious, as are the<br/>
buffs.  Paladins get good buffs and cures as well, and a L39<br/>
paladin is using the same heal spell as a L34 cleric.  My<br/>
paladin friend was able to act as primary healer for a L35-40<br/>
party we had in Mistmoore.</div>
