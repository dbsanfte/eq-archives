<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600046661">Actually, I found the answer in the Freeport Guild last night when I went to<br/>
buy some songs.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew I got instill doubt as a skill but never saw it on my skill list or<br/>
my trainers skill list.  But then I happened to hit the trainer in Freeport<br/>
who has the skill to teach it to the rest of us.  Not all trainers can train<br/>
you in this but the one in freeport can!  Up stairs I think.<br/>

		The way to dance is to target another player and hit your<br/>
instill doubt <br/>
		button.  The dance isn&#39;t as obvious in combat.  Get right in<br/>
his face when <br/>
		he&#39;s resting and you have a chance of scaring the pants off<br/>
him in RL.  <br/>
		Sadly, you will get the message &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anybody&quot;<br/>
in EQ.  If my <br/>
		fifty or so attempts are any indication, you don&#39;t get any<br/>
better trying this <br/>
		on PCs, but it&#39;s still amusing.  If you&#39;ve tried it and<br/>
still don&#39;t dance, it <br/>
		probably IS gender-related.<br/>
<br/>
		It has the same result as Screech, but not area effect.  It<br/>
also fails a lot <br/>
		more often.  Don&#39;t practice in combat unless you are able to<br/>
whistle <br/>
		innocently when your party asks &quot;Why did the MOB start<br/>
running?&quot;.<br/>
