&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Solo Spectre Camp Break?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just following up on an old thread.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was level 41 last night (42 now) and me and a ranger friend, Deerwen,<br/>
&gt; &gt; (level 45) fought a bunch of spectres last night.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since we were near Oasis we checked out the Spectres and found them<br/>
&gt; &gt; uncamped. He was concerned about how to break the camp. I told him not to<br/>
&gt; &gt; worry about it. He waited by the inn near the sro zone and after I got a<br/>
&gt; &gt; sow from him, sang my aria and ran out to the island in the middle of the<br/>
&gt;lake.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I tried to Lament the spectre closest to the edge that runs down towards<br/>
&gt; &gt; the water. Resisted. Ack! Here he comes with 4 of his friends. Hmmm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This ranger should be chastised for having you pull. In that situation he<br/>
&gt;should be up there with Harmony pulling. Lament, like the calm series runs<br/>
&gt;into this problem, harmony doesn&#39;t although it&#39;s limited to outdoors zones.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m always amazed at the difference a good bard can make, but at least in<br/>
&gt;this case the ranger had the edge.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True. I wondered about harmony after I went in. He was concerned about how <br/>
to break the camp and I&#39;m not that familiar with harmony. I know harmony <br/>
lowers the aggro range of a creature, but if the creature is out of range <br/>
of harmony, wouldn&#39;t it still get pulled?<br/>
<br/>
For instance, there&#39;s 4 spectres on each corner of the square island and 4 <br/>
in the tower (I really don&#39;t know the exact number. Never ran into there <br/>
with full spawn). I wouldn&#39;t know how the range would keep the ones in the <br/>
tower from aggroing, unless you can get close enough to them to harmony <br/>
without line of sight.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t too worried anyway since I handled the multiples pretty easily. <br/>
But it is good to know.<br/>
<br/>

My other concern is etiquette. Nobody was around the spectres and the <br/>
island was unbroken. As soon as I broke the spawn there were 3 other groups <br/>
who jumped in and started pulling spectres. One even ran us over with their <br/>
pull while we were medding and healing. I guess it&#39;s bound to happen since <br/>
I&#39;m pulling the spectres so far away. Seems rude on from one perspective, <br/>
but from another it seems inevitable unless you are sitting smack dab on <br/>
the island.<br/>
