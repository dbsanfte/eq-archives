&gt;	I&#39;d personally have to say it does exist.  Only recently have I not<br/>
&gt;been the center of a single mobs attack. ( if there are multi-mobs, they<br/>
&gt;come after either me,the cleric, or the enchanter).  I&#39;m level 24 and now<br/>
&gt;most of the melee types are doing far more damage than me, and so the mobs<br/>
&gt;leaves me alone, or the casters do far more damage than me, and they leave<br/>
&gt;me alone.  Pre-level 20, I was doing somewhat less damage than pallies,<br/>
&gt;monks, warriors, yet the mobs would stick to me like glue. Of course part <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;this is as a bard, I was usually relegated to pulling duty also, so I was<br/>
&gt;tops on their hate list before battle started, but it would often happen<br/>
&gt;regardless of whether I pulled or not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  What I find is that there is Bard Hate when I dont want it... and doesnt <br/>
exist when I do. :)  They beat on me when there are 4 tanks in the party, <br/>
but when I am the only hybrid... they beat up on the casters.  Gotta love <br/>
it. :)<br/>
