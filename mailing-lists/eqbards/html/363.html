<b>Subject:</b> Expansion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-79807908">I really only have one concern with the expansion, and that is that it<br/>
is an optional expansion. This mean that there will be people I am<br/>
playing with that don&#39;t have it, right? Now what does this mean? I am<br/>
pretty certain that Verant spoke about adding new creatures, and<br/>
possibly races, and who knows what else (spells, items). All of this on<br/>
top of the more than likely two new continents. How is this going to<br/>
affect the gameplay? What if I, playing with the expansion pack, and<br/>
partied with someone without?<br/>
<br/>
I guess there really isn&#39;t an issue as long as the expansion doesn&#39;t<br/>
add new races. All of the new zones, creatures, etc could be kept to<br/>
the new continents. But what about the boat to get there? Would someone<br/>
without the expansion not see it? Would they be magically barred from<br/>
entering it? I&#39;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that it<br/>
will all work great when it comes out, but these are questions that I<br/>
will have nonetheless until then.<br/>

Whoa. Ease up there Gabriel. Take a look at how many years it takes <br/>
to develop a game like this. Of course they are working on an <br/>
expansion. Otherwise, LONG after the current bugs are fixed people <br/>
would be complaining there were no MAJOR updates cuz the expansion <br/>
would still be a year down the road. Just because they are looking <br/>
ahead and planning expansions to the game doesn&#39;t mean they have <br/>
stopped working on the current issues, they are announcing fixes to <br/>
existing problems every week on EQ vault and EQ Stratics. <br/>
Let&#39;s stop complaining about everything under the sun and give Verant <br/>
some credit for designing the most awesome online game to ever come<br/>
along.<br/>
