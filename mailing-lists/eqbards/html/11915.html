 </span></blockquote>  Yup.  I remember those days.  Bards would always run around the place<br/>
  and as a cleric in beta it really pissed me off &lt;g&gt;  I couldn&#39;t ever<br/>
  meditate.  hehe, one song pulse, and poof I stand up.  I too will agree <br/>
  with the assessment made which states:<br/>
<br/>
  bard sings song.<br/>
  song has a fixed radius.<br/>
  locate all objects within the radius of bard and contact them.<br/>
  if song is party based, and this object is in party, affect.<br/>
  if song is nonparty based, and this object is not in party, affect.<br/>
<br/>
  what did verant forget?<br/>
<br/>
  well, since bards in beta affected everyone, thus making them<br/>
  unbalanced, verant couldnt radically change the bard song code<br/>
  so they put in this object sensor stuff in.  all objects get<br/>
  the signal from the bard, whether the song affects them directly<br/>
  is based on the party status.  pretty easy patch to implement, <br/>
  and it solved the problem. (kinda)<br/>
<br/>
  what it didn&#39;t do is prevent NPCs from receiving a signal and<br/>
  interpreting it as assisting another player.  if you are a druid<br/>
  who happens to kite a NPC through my pulsing heal/mana/selos,<br/>
  I am instantly added to the hate list and will receive faction<br/>
  hits.<br/>
<br/>
  It is my belief that this stems the bard hate and faction mishaps<br/>
  we often see.  This only affects party based songs.  If verant<br/>
  would take the time to code in signals only sent to players in<br/>
  the group, I believe this would eliminate a lot of headaches we<br/>
  often receive through no fault of our own.  Damn, verant fix<br/>
  something the right way?  I&#39;m dreaming again, sorry.<br/>
