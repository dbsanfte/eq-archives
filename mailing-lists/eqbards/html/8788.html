The Blade Fiend was probably one of the best solo fights I&#39;ve ever had in<br/>
this game.  I was soloing at Unrest... killing Ghouls and Dark Boned, etc.<br/>
I went inside and saw the thing hanging out near the porch door.  I check my<br/>
surroundings.... satisfied that no other creatures would interfere, I pulled<br/>
him out to the wall.<br/>
<br/>
The ensuing battle was pretty touch and go... It finally came down to both<br/>
of us at around a bubble of health a piece (relatively speaking, of course).<br/>
I made the decision that I was not going to run.  Needless to say, I was<br/>
victorious and ended the fight at 20 or 30 HPs.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that I had *just* returned from Lavastorm where I had<br/>
purchased a Combine Rapier.  When I looted the Blade Fiend, I was like<br/>
&quot;Cool... a Fine Steel Dagger&quot;.  Then I examined the weapon and my jaw nearly<br/>
dropped from my skull.  It was better than the Rapier I had purchased not<br/>
more than a hour previous.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the Rapier went into the bank and Pugius became my new secondary<br/>
weapon (a couple hours later, a Bard friend of mine gave me a Barbed Whip...<br/>
the most weapons I&#39;ve ever gone through in a 4 hour period).<br/>

&gt; Pugius is a drop off the Lesser Balde Fiend in Unrest. It&#39;s a <br/>
&gt; (really?) rare <br/>
&gt; spawn who is level 21. You&#39;ll either get pugius or gladius. <br/>
&gt; The fiend looks <br/>
&gt; kinda like an enchanter animation, just way better, more <br/>
&gt; weapons and all <br/>
&gt; this rotating at high speed, really cool sight and sounds.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I acquired a Pugius dagger quite some time ago from a <br/>
&gt; friendly bard for <br/>
&gt; &gt;only<br/>
&gt; &gt;25pp.  It&#39;s stats are 6dam 23 delay magic peircing.  Its <br/>
&gt; damage ratio is<br/>
&gt; &gt;just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have any stat<br/>
&gt; &gt;increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this <br/>
&gt; weapon be found?  It<br/>
&gt; &gt;looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the <br/>
&gt; only one I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he <br/>
&gt; got it...so any<br/>
&gt; &gt;help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same<br/>
&gt; &gt;graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>
