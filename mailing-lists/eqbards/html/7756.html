<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031011084">He never said beating it he said definiding himself. The diffrence is the<br/>
melee class can usually run the length of the zone with mix of jumping and<br/>
running and stilllive while a caster will drop dead quite quickly.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;First, I want to make one point: most deaths occur 2 to 3 zones from<br/>
&gt;&gt;the bind point.<br/>
&gt;Agreed this would be the average death distance<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;With those points made, I believe that Verant gave magic-users and priests<br/>
&gt;&gt;the ability to bind anywhere because making the 2 - 3 zone run to fetch a<br/>
&gt;&gt;corpse can be darn near impossible.  Magic-users are roughly 40% less<br/>
&gt;&gt;effective in melee combat because of their reduced OFF/DEF, and priests<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;down 20%, and neither group has any special melee attacks like the melee<br/>
&gt;&gt;classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Having played a wizard up to the mid-teens before becoming a full-time<br/>
&gt;bard,<br/>
&gt;&gt;I can tell you how hard it can be for a naked wizard to handle a tough<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;that has latched onto you when you are making the run-of-shame to your<br/>
&gt;&gt;corpse -- and this is with the best root and DD spells in the business.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Agreed the wizard might have a tough time with a hard blue<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;For a melee class, the run is an inconvenience, but without nearly as much<br/>
&gt;&gt;risk, as you can either outrun any problems that may arise (bards), hide<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt;sneak from them (rogues), or have enough varied attacks that do not rely<br/>
&gt;&gt;upon weapons alone that you can defend yourself adequately (warriors,<br/>
&gt;monks,<br/>
&gt;&gt;et.al.).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You gotta be kidding me.  I can&#39;t take a tough blue reliably, and after<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it has been the general consensus none of these classes can solo a tough<br/>
&gt;blue, and that&#39;s with all our equipment.  If a warrior over 20th level<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a tough blue naked, he dies.  Not most of the time, nearly every time.  He<br/>
&gt;has zero chance of beating it without his primary equipment.  The caster<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;at least root and run, if not root and nuke.  The warrior can just run and<br/>
&gt;either zone or die.  Fortunately bards can run fast and zone, or die.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A caster without his equipment is far more effective than any melee class,<br/>
&gt;monks excepted, when he is naked.  A caster&#39;s main equipment is his spells<br/>
&gt;which he can regain immediately.  All other classes rely on thing they left<br/>
&gt;on their body to survive.  In truth it is far less dangerous for a caster<br/>

&gt;cross the karanas to Highhold.  He had no way to evade, no way to fight,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;he could not run fast enough.  Of all the melee classes, only the bard can<br/>
&gt;safely return to his corpse by outrunning the dangers.  Goodness imagine<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;long it would take to Sneak from freeport to Guk, egads you&#39;d be running to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The argument I make is that there is a compelling need for magic-users and<br/>
&gt;priests to be able to bind and bind anywhere.  That need is not present for<br/>
&gt;fighters and hybrids; rather, it would simply be a convenient ability to<br/>
&gt;have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With all the work that Verant has done to balance the various classes, I do<br/>
&gt;not believe that one can reasonably expect them to make this major change<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the game without a compelling need.  I believe that it is also important to<br/>
&gt;consider the outcry Verant would get from the seven classes that can bind<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;they let everyone bind.  Can&#39;t you already hear Namby Pamby the Necromancer<br/>
&gt;shouting across the zone about how badly Verant nerfed the casters, and how<br/>
&gt;they are owed some special &#39;hot death from above&#39; spell to offset the loss?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My parting thought is this: sure I&#39;d love to have bind.  I&#39;d also like to<br/>

&gt;by my creators with a wide variety of marvelous abilities (most of which<br/>
&gt;work), but bind is not one of them.  Being adaptable, I make do with what I<br/>
&gt;have, and frankly, I do pretty well.<br/>
