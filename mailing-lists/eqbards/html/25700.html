<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633549332">I don&#39;t (didn&#39;t) solo much but my favorite was DOT/Selo kiting. You rarely<br/>
get hit, can twist in heal if you need, can really do good damage if you<br/>
mooch a SOW and - best of all - you control where the fight happens.<br/>
<br/>
Fear kiting works best if you have a melee friend and no healer. Killing<br/>
them fast is critical. Fear works great on some mobs, but is resisted on<br/>
many too. You have to expect to get hit occassionally so have Selo ready<br/>
just in case.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite Fear/Kiting spots are ones where the mobs stayed in small area<br/>
for the most part. You need to be in your 40&#39;s for these two areas<br/>
however. First, is the little field in DW right before you zone into BW.<br/>
Pull something back there, then slow and fear it before it hits you.<br/>
Second, is the Log(tm) in BW. This is a guild favorite spot. It&#39;s a little<br/>
clearing just NE of the giant fort. No wanderers and mobs stay in the<br/>
clearing.<br/>
<br/>
Velious might be a good spot for you at 31st but try to find spot to pull<br/>
to where there&#39;s no wanderers and mobs that don&#39;t resist much.<br/>
