<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808813290">aw man, now something else to test hehe.  well i DID test the theory about<br/>
the lute doubling the healing rate every other pulse.  this is not true.  i<br/>
will have to go buy a regular mandolin/lute and test again hehe.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was some discussion earlier about the Lute of the Gypsy <br/>
&gt; Princess and<br/>
&gt; whether or not it had any magical effects... but I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; remember anyone<br/>
&gt; testing it and posting their findings here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have now seen on several websites that the Lute has <br/>
&gt; recently been upgraded<br/>
&gt; to increase the power of Stringed instruments by 25%.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone confirm this please? Should be easy to test with <br/>
&gt; the healing<br/>
&gt; song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
