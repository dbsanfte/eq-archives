<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446331460">Well there are kids in Rivervale, as well as grandparents.  There is the in <br/>
game passage of time, I think at least one year has passed in game since <br/>
release.  For the reason why Dark Elves hate High/Wood Elves check the back <br/>
story in the manual, esp the portion on how the Dark Elves came to be.  <br/>
Brownies are kinda cute, esp that scamp Nillipus.<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; and has kids.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thats what i&#39;ve always wondered , in this &quot; virtual world &quot; why are there <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt;children ?<br/>
&gt;I mean , it isn&#39;t essential to the game , but it would add to the realism<br/>
&gt;for me personally. We have lots of quests involving sons / daughters. but <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;have no idea how old they are , we have no idea how old anyone is. Some<br/>
&gt;people might say this is a good thing , i think it sucks. I personally <br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt;have loved starting out as a teenager , and every ten levels getting a new<br/>
&gt;look. being grown up or even old by lvl 50.  So in that whole crappy <br/>
&gt;conning<br/>
&gt;system you could tell a red from a RED just by looking at them ( i know <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t apply to most monsters and animals and such) .<br/>
&gt;I personally wish this game was more immersive , sometimes it can be , but<br/>
&gt;other times it just isn&#39;t at all. I would like to be able to feel why the<br/>
&gt;dark elves are evil , and why they hate the wood elves and such. ( ok i&#39;m<br/>
&gt;ramblin )<br/>
