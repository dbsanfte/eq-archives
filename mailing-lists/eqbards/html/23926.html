<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544445310">I don&#39;t see how this change does anything but make a worthless song worthless.  If I&#39;m trying to plug a<br/>
3-foot hole in a dam with 3 sticks of chewing gum, handing me a fourth stick of gum doesn&#39;t help.  I&#39;ve<br/>
memmed this song a few times in an attempt to find some song combination that could let me aggro the<br/>
primary MOB; I have never once had it land for any damage.  It is always resisted.  Increasing zero by 25%<br/>
still gives you, well, zero.  Even if this were utterly resist-proof (and as a once every 40 minutes<br/>
&quot;desperate&quot; song, I think it easily could be), it still does so little damage on a high-end MOB that you<br/>
won&#39;t see the hit bar move.  Why would anyone waste a song slot on this?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t care, except that Verant probably thinks they&#39;ve done us a favor, and will count this towards<br/>
their belief that we&#39;re &quot;balanced&quot;.  And if this is they way they&#39;re going to balance all the REST of the<br/>
stuff, well....<br/>

&gt; &gt;it&#39;s still a complete and utter waste of a spell slot. I&#39;m really going to<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m so disappointed it hurts. Why bother trying to &quot;balance&quot; the classes if<br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;re going to fall so short.<br/>

&gt; Why bother trying to discuss class balance if you&#39;re not going to even look at the possibility<br/>
&gt; that bards are overpowered already?  And if you won&#39;t accept that if bards are currently overpowered<br/>
&gt; compared to other classes as a whole that they won&#39;t get major improvements while some other<br/>
&gt; classes will, then I predict you are about to be even more disappointed.<br/>
