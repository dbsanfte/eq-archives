<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889592137">Just a bit off topic here but I&#39;m hoping that by now you all have heard of the Foreverquest Project, devoted to bringing rp elements to eq by means of the Heartstone Saga.<br/>
The reason I am sending this is in hopes that the bards on this list can help if in no more then spreading the word or watching and recording what goes forth.  <br/>
