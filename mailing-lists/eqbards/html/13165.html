<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-725862078"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Prior to this, my experience was that Lullaby, Pixie Strike,<br/>
&gt; stun, and mesmerize would interrupt 100% of the time if it<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t resisted and stuck before they finished casting.  <br/>
&gt; They&#39;re equivalent to being stunned by a mob - that will<br/>
&gt; interrupt your casting 100% regardless of channeling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s funny that this comes up.<br/>
<br/>
  I forgot if I mentioned this before on the list, if I did <br/>
  I apologize for repeating.  I have refined numbers/stats<br/>
  since then, if I did post.<br/>
<br/>
  Cleric of Innoruuk in the PoH has approximately 15000 hps,<br/>
  as do most common mobs in there do (14k-17k).  So give or<br/>
  take a few thousand.<br/>
<br/>
  It takes about a minute I&#39;d say to drop one on average.<br/>
  Once I saw one drop in 30 secs, but Tashani + Malosi + ICs<br/>
  were the reason I believe.  I&#39;ll use a nice round 60 secs<br/>
  for this discussion.  At any given second during the 60 secs,<br/>
  the Cleric would be taking an average 250 dmg.<br/>
<br/>
  At 250dmg/sec and a casting time of 10 seconds for complete<br/>
  healing, thats 2500dmg that the NPC would have to cast through.<br/>
<br/>
  The most I&#39;ve heard a player cast through was recently in the PoF<br/>
  and it was 600 dmg, and that was a druid gating (a 5 second casting<br/>
  spell).  His channeling was maxxed at 200.<br/>
<br/>
  If 600 dmg is to 200 channelling, then 2500 dmg is to 833 chanelling.<br/>
<br/>
  Needless to say through all the slamming, bashing, pixie&#39;s we stuck<br/>
  to him, he regained and completely healed.  Damn those NPCs with<br/>
  800+ channelling.<br/>
<br/>
