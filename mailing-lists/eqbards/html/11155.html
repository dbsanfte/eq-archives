<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965569314">agreed, I meant that the mob or critter if you prefer should be banned if<br/>
anyone, not that we should all be banned, sorry if that was unclear.  When<br/>
they root me they force me to take advantage of an exploit if I am already<br/>
playing accelerando at the time, because if its a bug when it breaks me free<br/>
if it pulses I exploit if I keep singing and if its a bug that it break the<br/>
Root when the song stops I exploit if I do not keep singing.  Nothing I can<br/>
do reasonably will prevent accelerando from breaking the Root at the point<br/>
they cast it on me if I am already singing.  If its an exploit, its one I<br/>
cannot avoid at the point except to just stand there when it gets broken.<br/>
That I think would be unreasonable.  Not that that puts it out of Verant&#39;s<br/>
venue by any means.<br/>

Early trip home due to snow in 8 minutes here in Denver, woohoo!<br/>

Ok, well if Verant did truly intend Selo&#39;s to break root, they sure did<br/>
a sloppy job with it.<br/>
When you cure a disease, or dispel a buff, etc the appropriate icon and<br/>
effect is taken off to indicate this effect has been cancelled. Not so<br/>
with Selo&#39;s breaking root, so it would appear to be buggy. And as for<br/>
sitting there being rooted after you zone, thats just ridiculous.<br/>
Either A) Verant is quite sloppy with their intentions for Selo&#39;s to<br/>
break root, or B) Its just a bug.<br/>
Choice A wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all.. I mean this is Verant afterall.<br/>
But I&#39;m inclined to believe choice B.<br/>
Now technically if its marked as a bug and you use it.. this is<br/>
exploiting. But as if Verant would care. So don&#39;t be a jerk and say<br/>
stuff like &quot;oh we should all be banned!&quot;<br/>
Anyways.. think my point is that the way its currently designed now, it<br/>
cannot be ruled out as a bug.<br/>
