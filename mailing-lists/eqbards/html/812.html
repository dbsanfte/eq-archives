<div id="ygrps-yiv-986017889">Totally agreed! I have found that as a bard, teaming up with a monk is one <br/>
of the most excellent choices for a partner (as long as you choose the right <br/>
opponents) if you want to keep your party count low.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hello I am at lvl 12 Wood elf bard.  it seems that I cannot find a good<br/>
&gt; &gt;place for me to solo.  I went to CB but the orc&#39;s hit so hard that it<br/>
&gt;keeps<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At level 12, I was still doing OK hunting solo in the Steamfont Mountains.<br/>
&gt;  I liked the areas near the Windmills where you can find skeletons, <br/>
&gt;drakes,<br/>
&gt;and harpies.  Just pick your targets carefully, and kick in the bardboots<br/>
&gt;song and run if your health goes below half or if a second creature engages<br/>
&gt;you while you&#39;re fighting the first one.  (Skeletons are especially a<br/>
&gt;problem this way, since they stun.  I died only once to a drake, but<br/>
&gt;several times to skeletons or skeleton-rat gangups, because they stunned me<br/>
&gt;and kept me from runnint.)  And of course if you see the Minotaur Hero, run<br/>
&gt;for the city or the zoneline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Starting from level 10, though, I found that soloing became increasingly<br/>
&gt;difficult.  At level 12 it got a big boost from the Bellow song, which<br/>
&gt;probably increased my combat effectiveness by fifty percent.  But as you<br/>
&gt;  increase in level, you will find yourself much more effective in a party<br/>
&gt;than solo.  I found that teaming up with Monks works especially well.  Even<br/>
&gt;if I did nothing but stand there and play the lute twiddling between<br/>
&gt;healing song and battlesong (and hit with an occasional punch for a few<br/>
&gt;points), the monks and I together got far more experience than either could<br/>
&gt;manage on our own, since they fought better and didn&#39;t have to wait so long<br/>
&gt;between battles to recover.<br/>
