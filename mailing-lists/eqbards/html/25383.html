Well I can see your points Shada, but I have to also say that I still do<br/>
believe Bards are useful on raids.  People say shaman are useful on raids..<br/>
sure, 3 shaman are, but 6?  If there are 6 shaman on our raids I just sit<br/>
there and play Diablo on my other comp. (Hope nobody from my guild is<br/>
reading this!)  And again, I haven&#39;t played a bard on 40+ person raids.  I<br/>
do know that our main Necro switched to the bard character of someone who<br/>
had left the game (Iridis), and he is constantly amazed at how much more<br/>
useful bards are than necros in group raids.<br/>
<br/>
*shrug*<br/>
Maybe its that we all just get bored after a while?<br/>

&gt; You mean 380MR when VI says the cap is 255 and anything over <br/>
&gt; is wasted?<br/>
&gt; Or the people who say they resist less with 350 than with <br/>
&gt; 190?  With the<br/>
&gt; first nag and vox raids when there was not a large variety of resist<br/>
&gt; gear, sure bards helped a lot.  Today, anyone can easily buff their<br/>
&gt; resists with equipment.  Tests are inconclusive as to what <br/>
&gt; point resists<br/>
&gt; are soft-capped (anywhere from 175 to 255).  Level is the <br/>
&gt; primary factor<br/>
&gt; in resisting.  Equipment gives you permanent resists and resists buffs<br/>
&gt; from other classes stay on you whereas resists from bards are <br/>
&gt; gone when<br/>
&gt; they lag or die.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i.e. there is nothing amazing about bard resists except impressing<br/>
&gt; others with big numbers, you haven&#39;t &quot;needed&quot; bards for resists in a<br/>
&gt; long time.  I&#39;m only talking about need with your and Dark&#39;s <br/>
&gt; arguments.<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t need a bard for resists, you don&#39;t need a bard for DS (every<br/>
&gt; person in an AL raid gets a diamond from the VP mage staff, DS done on<br/>
&gt; EVERY person in the raid, not just 6 people in 1 group).  You <br/>
&gt; only need<br/>
&gt; 1 bard for OOS.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I agree with Dark about 6-man EXP groups.  Bards are incredible IF<br/>
&gt; they are filling in the role of enchanter/shaman.  If an enchanter or<br/>
&gt; shaman is there, there are things you CAN do, but the true skills of a<br/>
&gt; bard are wasted.  On a big raid if there is more than 1 bard there,<br/>
&gt; there are things you CAN do, but another class could help the <br/>
&gt; raid much<br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Disclaimer: I loved my bard, always have.  I didn&#39;t quit <br/>
&gt; cause of bards,<br/>
&gt; was cause of RL.  I didn&#39;t come back as a monk for any reason, I liked<br/>
&gt; how cured silk looked on humans, that&#39;s about it.  Ya I am 50 now I do<br/>
&gt; love the monk but will always be a bard at heart.<br/>

&gt; I totally disagree Shada, bards are very useful, imo on large <br/>
&gt; raids, the<br/>
&gt; resistances they provide alone are amazing...<br/>
