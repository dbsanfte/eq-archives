&gt; You&#39;d never guess which two of our songs they picked, rarely used.  One of<br/>
&gt; their favorites was Jig O Vigor.  Heheh, the other was Aquatic Ayre!  We<br/>

there were aqua goblins in the zone.<br/>

Another place worth investigating is the shipwreck off Wisp<br/>
Isle in Erudin&#39;s Crossing.  There is a sharp dropoff behind<br/>
the wreck.  My friend and I went down the dropoff.  I stopped<br/>
because I lost sight of him but he went a bit further and<br/>
swears he saw a fish or mermaid down there.  I plan to explore<br/>
it more fully in the future.<br/>
