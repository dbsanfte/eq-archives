<div id="ygrps-yiv-101190543">I forgot to report that I have payed close attention to all your suggestions<br/>
for where to fight with Tsengu.<br/>
<br/>
Tsengu spent all of 10 in North Karana at the spires. Great zone for a<br/>
youngun, a nice place to hang with higher levels too for advice,buying and<br/>
selling and drive-by buffings.<br/>
<br/>
11-12.25 has been Kurns Tower as I reported. One nice thing about the<br/>
skellies is that quite often they drop 2-4 gold, which is a lot for a level<br/>
10-12 mob. When you get bored you can go outside and look for bugs/exiles.<br/>
It is starting to get a bit long in the tooth however, I think it may be<br/>
time soon to be off to Unrest. I just can&#39;t miss it again.<br/>
<br/>
One note on the Kicsh, when I said i would wait till 19 to go get it I was<br/>
assuming it was still NO DROP and I might be able to loot it if I was<br/>
patient. Since it isn&#39;t....I think it will be a while longer :o)<br/>
<br/>
Tszaaz/Tsengu<br/>
