Subject: Problems last night with Lament (pre-patch)<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was in Cazic in the area that someone in<br/>
my party called<br/>
the<br/>
Purple Temple.  You get to it by going through the<br/>
double doors in the<br/>
courtyard and following a long twisting hallway. <br/>
Halfway there you go<br/>
through a round opening called the arena.  Past the<br/>
arena is another<br/>
hallway<br/>
that eventually opens up to the Temple.  This is the<br/>
place where the<br/>
Lizard<br/>
Crusader spawns.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After we got rid of the spawns alongside the temple, I<br/>
started pulling<br/>
from<br/>
the front of the temple.  I equipped my lute and<br/>
started up Lament.  I<br/>
would<br/>
always Lament the mob furthest away from me and pull<br/>
the one closest to<br/>
me.<br/>
Every time there were two mobs up, the mob I<br/>
successfully Lamented<br/>
would<br/>
still aggro when I pulled the closest mob.  I was<br/>
getting pissed off<br/>
because<br/>
the song had absolutely no effect.  I ended up pulling<br/>
two mobs on<br/>
every<br/>
pull.  Someone in my party told me that harmony and<br/>
lament type<br/>
spells/songs<br/>
don&#39;t work in Cazic.  You get the message the<br/>
spell/song was resisted,<br/>
but<br/>
the mobs will still aggro if a nearby mob is pulled.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have an idea of why Lament didn&#39;t work like it<br/>
should have?  <br/>

Lament worked fine, pathing is goofy there. If you<br/>
lament the 4 static lizzies near the temple steps (2<br/>
silver guards, 2 prot/sent/fan/heralds) and pull one<br/>
by the door, it will path right over the lizard<br/>
opposite of it. Without lament, you&#39;d get all 4. I<br/>
usually pulled for my party, from the temple into the<br/>
&quot;fishbowl&quot; as we called it. (You called it the arena).<br/>
We were lvl 25-29 at the time, and a roamer could hurt<br/>
us bad. We would get 2 lizzies at a time, sometimes 3,<br/>
still easily managable. Lament was great for us, and<br/>
it works everywhere in Cazic.<br/>
