<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077518826">It may backfire Talies, there are people who think that a incredibly sexy<br/>
wood elf female (mainly the blond one for some reason) plays the wood elf<br/>
bard that you see in game.  IT is also entirely possible that there are<br/>
people who think that the troll female is played by a incredibly sexy wood<br/>
elf female =).  In that case he may like the troll come on =).<br/>

&gt; &gt;Here&#39;s an idea:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;When being stalked by an unscrupulous 16 year old, get the stalker&#39;s name <br/>
&gt; &gt;and log out. Now log back in using your ogre female. Find the stalker and <br/>
&gt; &gt;turn the tables on them, i.e. follow them around, make suggestive <br/>
&gt; &gt;statements, etc. This will surely frighten them off and give them an idea of <br/>
&gt; &gt;how their actions affect others. Don&#39;t push it too far, i.e. harassment, <br/>
&gt; &gt;just enough to make your point. You might even role play it a bit to make it <br/>
&gt; &gt;fun. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh - &quot;Bhuku think you cute.  Bhuku want hug you and squeeze you - bet you<br/>
&gt; feel good under armor...  Take armor off - let Bhuku see.&quot;<br/>
