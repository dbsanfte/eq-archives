&gt;It sure would be nice to have some more magic instruments in the game. After<br/>
&gt;much consideration my Most Desired Magic Instrument (tm) would be a regular<br/>
&gt;ol&#39; drum...but one that sticks with you when you die. You awaken in the<br/>
&gt;Arena, naked to the world, with 3 or so zones to cross...wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
&gt;wonderful to have that drum sitting there in your inventory? No, we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;bind, and I am happy with that, but at EXACTLY the time you could really<br/>
&gt;leverage your abilities to lessen the pain, blah, no drum. Sure, I keep one<br/>
&gt;in the bank for when I am bound to a city,  but often zoning to the bank to<br/>
&gt;get it is just not what I have patience for after dying... Just a thought,<br/>
&gt;one born of making level 18 five times this weekend :o)<br/>
<br/>

never seem to find anyone to rebind me elsewhere ;(<br/>
