&gt; The only real threat were those froggie wizzards who would come in a bit<br/>

Elemental Rhythms.  They both provide the same magic resist,<br/>
and Elemental provides fire and cold resist as well (most if<br/>
not all wizard spells are magic/fire/cold).  If I can only<br/>
keep one of these two loaded, it&#39;s Elemental.  Guardian&#39;s only<br/>
advantages are a few more AC, and it stacks with different<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
The difference a Rhythm song can make at this level is<br/>
tremendous.  I&#39;ve had half my party killed in 15 seconds from<br/>
a 3 ghoul wizard pull when I wasn&#39;t ready.  We took on the<br/>
same wizards a half hour later with me playing ER with a drum,<br/>
and only one person took more than a bubble of damage.  The<br/>
usual pullers I group with keep saying, &quot;Send Kae to pull the<br/>
caster&quot; because they don&#39;t want to do it without the resists.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is really more of a concern for casting classes.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t noticed it making a difference for damage shields.  <br/>
Mobs always take full damage from the shield assuming they&#39;re<br/>
telling the truth when they say &quot;Hit by 7 points non-melee<br/>
damage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Second, does psalm of cooling provide a cold based damage shield? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I still don&#39;t know if it stacks or cancels a magician&#39;s<br/>
fire based damage shields.<br/>
