&gt; The only real threat were those froggie wizzards who would come in a bit<br/>
&gt; after the first pulled mob and sit at the edge of the room and play Burn the<br/>
&gt; Bard!  Yowzer I was down to under a bub once or twice before our cleric<br/>
&gt; slapped a heal on me.  I had been weaving psalm of warmth with anthem for<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After a couple nasty burn attacks from these wizzies, I went to buffing with<br/>
&gt; guardian and a drum from the time the puller went out to fetch until the<br/>
&gt; enchanter managed to get them all sorted out after the puller and all of the<br/>
&gt; mobs returned.  I guess I should have been stacking guardian and elemental<br/>
&gt; with the drum. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Guardian Rhythms should only be used as a supplement to<br/>
Elemental Rhythms.  They both provide the same magic resist,<br/>
and Elemental provides fire and cold resist as well (most if<br/>
not all wizard spells are magic/fire/cold).  If I can only<br/>
keep one of these two loaded, it&#39;s Elemental.  Guardian&#39;s only<br/>
advantages are a few more AC, and it stacks with different<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
The difference a Rhythm song can make at this level is<br/>
tremendous.  I&#39;ve had half my party killed in 15 seconds from<br/>
a 3 ghoul wizard pull when I wasn&#39;t ready.  We took on the<br/>
same wizards a half hour later with me playing ER with a drum,<br/>
and only one person took more than a bubble of damage.  The<br/>
usual pullers I group with keep saying, &quot;Send Kae to pull the<br/>
caster&quot; because they don&#39;t want to do it without the resists.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyhow, my questions are:  how do you know what attacks (fire based or cold<br/>
&gt; based) mobs are more susceptable to?  Ie, I have heard that its pretty<br/>
&gt; useless to hit the mobs in Lava storm with fire based attacks. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is really more of a concern for casting classes.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t noticed it making a difference for damage shields.  <br/>
Mobs always take full damage from the shield assuming they&#39;re<br/>
telling the truth when they say &quot;Hit by 7 points non-melee<br/>
damage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Second, does psalm of cooling provide a cold based damage shield? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I still don&#39;t know if it stacks or cancels a magician&#39;s<br/>
fire based damage shields.<br/>
