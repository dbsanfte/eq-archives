<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037880904">Ugh!  I wish you were on Innoruuk - I would come help you.  Get one of the<br/>
local oger/trolls to kill some lizards and use one of those flutes.  Not<br/>
sure if any are sold in Ogg or Feer - prolly only if a hunter sold one to a<br/>
merch.  You can get them from the gypsy merchants in Rathe Mts just past the<br/>
Inns on the way to the Lake Rathe zone. <br/>
<br/>
CT is not a good place for level 19/20 - unless you work the courtyard and<br/>
are ready to zone fast.  And the Maze is a bad place period. High 30&#39;s and<br/>
even 40&#39;s can get agro&#39;d and have a pack of lizzie on them in no time - not<br/>
to mention getting lost.  I hate that maze! <br/>
<br/>
Your best bet is to try to find a high level player to help you CR.  When I<br/>
went there in my high 20&#39;s and low 30&#39;s stuff would see me.  My invis,<br/>
other&#39;s invis, my bad luck - whatever - stuff would see me.  So, it&#39;s gonna<br/>
be real tough for you to try to drag your self out - unless you are close<br/>
and know the maze.  Get a map.<br/>

cazic and the link to the maze map.<br/>

Good Luck!<br/>

		Well, I went to Cazic Thule for the first time last<br/>
		night at 3/4 of a bubble to go to get to level 20.  I<br/>
		went because one of my guildmates wanted me to go with<br/>
		him.  We got ourselves bound just inside Ogguk and<br/>
		then proceeded to Cazic.  To make a long story short I<br/>
		now have a whole bub to go to get to 20 and my body is<br/>
		somewhere in the maze.  <br/>
<br/>
		What I want to know is...<br/>
<br/>
		Where can I buy a wind instrument in Feerrot or Ogguk?<br/>
		  <br/>
<br/>
		I&#39;ve already died once on my first attempt at a CR due<br/>
		to the Camo that I had dropping just as a train went<br/>
		by.  I trust my own song more than someone elses<br/>
		spell.<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks in advance,<br/>
