<div id="ygrps-yiv-40778785">Back when Menuette was alive the most amusing group I was in was 3 necros,<br/>
one shaman, a druid and myself a bard.  She was upper 20&#39;s so no mana song<br/>
... but the three Necros and the Shaman were pacting/cannablizing<br/>
(respectively thier hp to mana lines).  The Shaman and Druid were trading<br/>
off tanking ... I was a reserve tank (yes - both could out tank poor<br/>
wood-elf me).  Our downtime was quite minimal - usually the Druid went low<br/>
mana healing himself after tanking out a DoT kill.   We were doing<br/>
yellow/red gnolls as fast as we could find them.  So yes - hymm to mana with<br/>
no Clarity even but with a shaman/necro heavy group worked nicely.  Worked<br/>
best with me in instrumental mode.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] healsong vs manasong<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; hey all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i heared you talking about bards and their problems getting into groups<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; before the transformation into a manabattery at 32. i didnt have problems<br/>
&gt; finding a group but have been frequently asked for that song, finally made<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; hotkey &quot;/g i get manasong at lvl 32, sorry&quot; ;)<br/>
&gt; then i grouped with a shaman and noticed him losing health. i asked him<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; he told me he was transforming hp into mana. hey, i thought, this turns<br/>
&gt; healsong into manasong! it worked out well of course.<br/>
&gt; do you have any experience with that? at wich level do shamans get this<br/>
&gt; spell? can other classes do this as well (necros)? if yes it would be<br/>
&gt; interesting to see what is more effective, manasong or healsong while the<br/>
&gt; casters eat their legs.<br/>
&gt; and then, try weaving heal and manasong with this tactic. should be very<br/>
low<br/>
&gt; downtime for shamans this way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; cheers<br/>
&gt; thony, 31 songs manasongless, the tribunal<br/>
&gt; tobi, 7 songs, tholuxe paells<br/>
