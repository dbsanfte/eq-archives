<div id="ygrps-yiv-562850913">I would recommend sticking to the walls.  It is unlikely anything will<br/>
attack you in these zones at the walls.  Go to the mountain - and go up as<br/>
high as you can.  When you get to East Commons go to the right until you hit<br/>
the mountain.  Run along the top of the mountain.  Zone to W Commons.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never been attacked by griffins, NPCs or Sand Giants on the North wall in W.<br/>
Commons (but the Sand Giant do hang out on the Desert wall)<br/>
<br/>
Continue running along the &quot;right wall&quot; in West Commons until you get to a<br/>
canyon.  Go into the canyon and Zone.  Do the same in Kiticor - run along<br/>
wall - but after a bit - don&#39;t stay up top - you can get fall damage and you<br/>
can miss the Rivervale Zone.<br/>

&gt; &gt;From Freeport head out into the East Commonlands.  Put your Accelerando<br/>
&gt; on, and take the trail into the woods.  When the trail splits, go left.<br/>
&gt; This will take you by several inns, and you&#39;ll be in sight of the desert<br/>
&gt; at times...keep an eye on those Griffins!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;ll zone to West Commonlands - this is the dangerous part.  Not only<br/>
