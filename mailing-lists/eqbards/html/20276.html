<div id="ygrps-yiv-586062570">Woohoo!  Congrats!  <br/>
<br/>
I got to admit I&#39;m cracking up picturing this, but not picturing it in the<br/>
EQ graphics sense, but as a scene in a movie where aged wizards are flipping<br/>
through spell books, standing, wiggling their fingers, frowning at the<br/>
results, and sitting back down to flip through more pages while a teeny,<br/>
tiny, itsy-bitsy, little minstral, staring straight up and hacking blindly<br/>
at the toes before him, belts out &quot;Here I come to save the day!&quot; through a<br/>
mega-phone.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s cracking me up.  ;^)<br/>

Peace<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok children, get comfy, I feel like relating one of Knaeve&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Tales of the <br/>
&gt; Ludicrous.  I usually just lurk on the list, but I have time <br/>
&gt; to kill at <br/>
&gt; work, and feel like sharing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So anyway, I&#39;m grouped with a cleric doing CR after a failed <br/>
&gt; Vox run.  We <br/>
&gt; had learned the hard way that 53+ clerics, even if they don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; engage Vox, <br/>
&gt; still get zapped out of the zone if they get even remotely <br/>
&gt; close (this was <br/>
&gt; right after the patch).  I was pumping mana and there were <br/>
&gt; about a dozen <br/>
&gt; people in the room, all of whom, by pure coincidence, were <br/>
&gt; casters.  And <br/>
&gt; they were all very LOM casters since they&#39;d just been rez&#39;d.  <br/>
&gt; Somehow, two <br/>
&gt; lvl 50 Ice Giants agro&#39;d on us.  I charmed one for a while <br/>
&gt; and had them <br/>
&gt; duel, but I myself had recently been rez&#39;d, so I ran out of <br/>
&gt; mana.  The <br/>
&gt; casters, using what little shred of mana was left, reduced <br/>
&gt; one to ashes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thus began The Bardic Prize Fight of the Century (may it <br/>
&gt; never be repeated).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The bad news:  I DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY CHANTS MEM&#39;D!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; F1<br/>
&gt; /bonk<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The good news: I had VoV, Niv&#39;s, and CoB mem&#39;d from working with some <br/>
&gt; melee&#39;s earlier to clear out the king room as we worked back <br/>
&gt; mostly naked to <br/>
&gt; the CR (the other melee had left, and as I&#39;ve stated, I was <br/>
&gt; the ONLY melee <br/>
&gt; in this room of OOM casters).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other good news: I have Sionachie&#39;s Partisan (only one on <br/>
&gt; Quel server to <br/>
&gt; my knowledge... I&#39;ll tack the stats to the end of this post) <br/>
&gt; which I&#39;m very <br/>
&gt; fond of.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I start to melee this frigging lvl 50 ice giant while <br/>
&gt; everyone med&#39;s <br/>
&gt; furiously.  Everyone who could heal had me targeted and so I would <br/>
&gt; periodically get incoming greater heals.  Every once in a <br/>
&gt; while a caster <br/>
&gt; would get enough mana for a nuke--but by some freakish chance <br/>
&gt; everyone was <br/>
&gt; getting horrid resists & partial resists.  And the fight went <br/>
&gt; on.  And on.  <br/>
&gt; And on.  While I tanked, twisted, and meleed the huge <br/>
&gt; bastard.  AFter about <br/>
&gt; two minutes, the cleric I had been mana feeding earlier asked <br/>
&gt; how stamina <br/>
&gt; was doing.  &quot;Out.&quot;  So he shot me a bar of stamina.  It was <br/>
&gt; sort of like the <br/>
&gt; people on the sidelines of the marathon handing a cup of <br/>
&gt; gatorade to one of <br/>
&gt; the runners.  It took 5 minutes to kill him.  Over that period I was <br/>
&gt; probably the recipient of 30 greater heals.  It was one of the most <br/>
&gt; ludicrous settings I&#39;ve seen--all these powerless casters <br/>
&gt; watching the lone <br/>
&gt; bard take on something with maybe 8-10k hp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Suffice it to say, me and the one person I was grouped with <br/>
&gt; (cleric) got the <br/>
&gt; xp for the kill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Knaeve, blah blah blah blah blah.<br/>
