The crested spaulders are the common drop from the mob that<br/>
drops the crested helm.  The helm is highly sought after, thus<br/>
producing many extraneous crested spaulders, which are either<br/>
sold, traded, twinked, given away, or worse (if you&#39;ve ever<br/>
wondered why the banker was wielding thulian claws, this is<br/>
why - the claws are the common drop for the rubi breastplate).<br/>
