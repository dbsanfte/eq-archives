&gt;whole lotta new songs out there - so I&#39;d like to know which songs will be<br/>
&gt;useful in which ways and combinations.<br/>
&gt;So.... as a starter,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1st Level - Chant of Battle:<br/>
&gt;The first (and for a while, most useful), it&#39;s sung in combat - but since<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s not harmful, it should be sung at all times during a young bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt;early life until they&#39;ve maxed out their singing skills.  It enhances<br/>
&gt;combat abilities for the Bard and everyone in their group, and can be<br/>
&gt;successfully twisted / stacked / harmonized with most other below-tenth<br/>
&gt;songs.  It becomes outdated with the tenth level song: &quot;Anthem de Arms&quot;<br/>
&gt;(can it still be stacked with that, though?)<br/>

with a higher str, and I found that this song gave me the biggest boost in <br/>
STR with my drum than any other one.<br/>
<br/>
Higher levels it would probably be better to use Cassindra&#39;s Elegy for the <br/>
int/wis bonuses, but this was another reason for me to use Chant of Battle.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Talies for starting a positive thread.<br/>
