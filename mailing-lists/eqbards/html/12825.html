&gt; &gt; &quot;keeping up&quot; with the battle when I can not have one hand on my movement<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also fight in the first person view, as I agree with you about the<br/>
&gt; immersiveness of it; although I do use the full screen view more than the<br/>
&gt; one with all the menu options. A question, though: Are you using your<br/>

&gt; have no problem switching from weapons to instruments and weaving songs,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AND<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; moving around, because of the fact I use the hotkey banks exclusively for<br/>
&gt; song weaving and weapons switching (which, btw... i learned how to do by<br/>
&gt; reading this list - thanks guys!). You can hotkey your melee and inventory<br/>
&gt; slots not just your songs/spells. I like the hotkeys so much so, that I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; many things hotkeyed that most people don&#39;t (all 6 of my hotkey banks are<br/>
&gt; full and I am continually rearranging depending on who is in my party,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>what<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we&#39;re fighting AND what tactics we&#39;re using).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use full screen 1st person for the complete immersive feel. : )  BTW, on a<br/>
side note, I wish we could turn off switching to a secondary view... I&#39;ve<br/>
died numerous times accidentally hitting F9 instead of F8 and then trying<br/>
desperately to F9 to the correct view, ehhe... One time trying to run out of<br/>
the Archon area thru the temple.  I invised myself so I didn&#39;t immediately<br/>
attract unwanted attention with the mobs on the corners and in the maze...<br/>
but got caught in a corner and couldn&#39;t tell which view I was in... (Didn&#39;t<br/>
have see invis.. hehe)<br/>
<br/>
I do have hotkey banks set up for both inventory and songs.  I have Bank 5<br/>
set up for &quot;All Songs&quot;.. Keys 1-4 are songs and 5 and 6 is Melee Weapon 2<br/>
and and inventory slot.  I use my left hand to switch songs and my right<br/>
hand to switch instruments with the mouse.  My desk is crowded (2 puters set<br/>
up on a single puter desk, my gf plays along side me) so my mouse is up by<br/>
the monitor, not on the side of my keyboard which would be preferable.<br/>
That&#39;s what makes it hard to both move my character AND switch instruments<br/>
at the same time.  I hope I&#39;m not missing something and there is an easier<br/>
way to switch instruments (other than usuing mouse control for my character,<br/>
I can never get used to that.  I use keyboard controls even in Wing<br/>
Commander :)  I&#39;m switching to a trackball that will fit alongside my<br/>
keyboard, so hopefully I can get more proficient with moving back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, all my hotkey banks are full, but I have a hard time swapping things<br/>
out... in an emergency, I need to have keystrokes very familiar (Shift 2, 4<br/>
for Selo&#39;s - Shift 5,1,F8,2 for Charm/Target/Pet Attack) otherwise I feel<br/>
I&#39;m behind the 8-ball.  I&#39;ve heard said on this list and I completely agree<br/>
that in a NON-twitch game, the Bard is definately a twitch character.  : )<br/>
