drop from the mob that drops the bloodstained tunic.  You will<br/>
probably want to get a bloodstained tunic with your cleric<br/>
eventually, and unless you&#39;re extraordinarily lucky, you&#39;re<br/>
likely to get 3-4 more mantles before you get a tunic (neither<br/>
of them are lore).<br/>
<br/>
On the basis of purely need, I would give it to the warrior.  <br/>
His class-based MR bonus is not really that large yet.  The<br/>
bard can buff his MR with his songs, so the mantle is not<br/>
quite as important.  Unless of course the warrior is stupid<br/>
and doesn&#39;t attack casters first, causing them to unload on<br/>
your bard.  :)<br/>
