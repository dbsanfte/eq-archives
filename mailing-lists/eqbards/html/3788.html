<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046693616">That is such a great story.  I&#39;ve always loved RPing (D&D and stuff <br/>
     not that.. get your mind out of the gutter...) with women but it is so <br/>
     rare.  Would have loved to sit in on some of your sessions.<br/>

Not quite, but I can add a 4 generation span of <br/>
... FRPing women!<br/>
     <br/>
My children aren&#39;t old enough to give me grandchildren yet .. <br/>
but my daughter plays EQ (and played 2 other on-line MMRPG&#39;s with <br/>
me).<br/>
     <br/>
Back in my younger days when I had time to DM/GM, my Grandmother <br/>
(who at the time was in her 80&#39;s) was a regular member of my <br/>
all-female FRP group.  The XT had yet to be invented.  Though,<br/>
I was programming a TRS-80 to do D&D character gen (AD&D hadn&#39;t <br/>
happened yet either).<br/>
     <br/>
My Grandmothers favorite : NG or LG Cleric<br/>
My Daughter&#39;s: right now a Female Ogre Warrior named Bombom <br/>
Hrrmmm .. I&#39;m the Bard.  Though a caster/thief hybrid is my<br/>
  preferred choice, Bard does well.<br/>
     <br/>
And I&#39;m going to be the typical female: my hair is going grey, and <br/>
that&#39;s as close to disclosing my age as I get!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m 51, married, and have 2 married sons who between them have 3 kids of <br/>
&gt;their own.  Both of them play EverQuest, too.  Can anyone beat that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Neither of them wants to play a bard, but it other than old inertia to play <br/>
&gt;a dwarf warrior, it was my obvious, enthusiastic choice.<br/>
