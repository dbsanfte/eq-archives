<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781679140">Actually, Wood Elf Bards and Half Elf Bards start with the same Charisma<br/>
(85) if unmodified by the user.  I think the Half Elf starts with higher<br/>
stats or more points overall, but I prefer the benefit of being able to wear<br/>
small and medium armor better.<br/>
<br/>
When I started my bard, I put most of my points in STR and CHA, weighing a<br/>
bit towards charisma. I just always have pictured a bard as being<br/>
charismatic, able to &quot;wow&quot; the crowds with stories and song. And I chose to<br/>
raise STR since it seems so combat oriented, and I wanted to be able to do<br/>
SOMETHING in combat. (smile). Also, I know it determines your weight<br/>
capacity, so I also wanted to be able to carry lots of stuff (packhorse<br/>
mentality) and after getting full set of bronze and all the other stuff I<br/>
haul around, I am glad I did!<br/>

&gt;i play a wood elf, the biggest advantage being that you can wear small or<br/>
&gt;medium armor.  plus i like to melee, i like to play a battle bard, so i put<br/>
&gt;all of my points in to strength.  with my enhancing items i am currently at<br/>
&gt;113 strength, 102 agility, and 101 dexterity.  so the points will come with<br/>
&gt;items as you get them.  also being a wood elf, you can wear all small<br/>

&gt;has to do with playing instruments, but it allows you to miss less when<br/>
&gt;meleeing (right? hehe), and yes agility allows you to get hit less.  i<br/>

&gt;that instrument.  the last stat you have to think of is charisma helping<br/>
&gt;your charm spell last longer, and some say your songs get resisted less.  i<br/>
&gt;believe a wood elf starts with higher charisma than a half elf.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m planning to create a bard either on Rallos Zek or preferrably the<br/>
&gt;&gt; racewar server (if I can hold out). I&#39;ve already chosen half elf as my<br/>
&gt;&gt; race and I intend to put most of my points into strength so that I can<br/>
&gt;&gt; easily carry steel plate, weapons and instruments.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, with the few remaining points I have, where do you<br/>
&gt;&gt; guys and gals<br/>
&gt;&gt; suggest I put them? Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity is<br/>
&gt;&gt; important<br/>
&gt;&gt; for playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does<br/>
&gt;&gt; it actually<br/>
&gt;&gt; increase the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>
&gt;&gt; frequently you miss a note?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Or perhaps agility would be better, as if I don&#39;t get hit, I don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;&gt; interrupted. Plus plate + agility is a nice combination.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Lastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>
&gt;&gt; steelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;&gt; to be in a<br/>
&gt;&gt; constant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to be<br/>
&gt;&gt; safe, but I<br/>
&gt;&gt; was thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into<br/>
&gt;&gt; dexterity and<br/>
&gt;&gt; agility).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; If less strength is okay, then I might consider just doing a<br/>
&gt;&gt; wood elf, as<br/>
&gt;&gt; they tend to have higher natural agility and dexterity.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Either elf fits<br/>
&gt;&gt; well in my IC perception of my character.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks for your help,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
