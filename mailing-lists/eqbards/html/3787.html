&gt; Bear in mind that the druid and necro are probably the easiest<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At least in the druid case, it&#39;s not that it&#39;s difficult, it&#39;s that it&#39;s<br/>
extremely frustrating. By L45 plus, I would guess most druids have a<br/>
circle of friends they adventure with, but when everything they cast at<br/>
Fire Giants is resisted _100%_ when the druid is L50 there is something<br/>
out of balance. The other night when we went after Tranix, even the<br/>
druid&#39;s ice based spells were resisted 100%. Now if makes some sense<br/>
that fire based creatures would have a higher than average fire resist,<br/>
but ice??? This basically reduced the druid to the role of poor healer<br/>
and gater. Meanwhile a L49 wizard&#39;s spells were getting through a lot<br/>
more consistantly.<br/>

&gt; And I thought we had a couple high level songs which lowered<br/>
&gt; monster resists?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At L46 our 3 magic resist lowering songs were resisted 100% of the time<br/>
by the ice giants. To bring this a bit back to the theme of the list,<br/>
has anyone else noted that even though the chant scrolls say they are<br/>
percussion, playing a drum doesnt appear to make a darn bit of<br/>
difference? I tested chant of flame and chant of ice on myself with my<br/>
Mistmoore drum and playing a drum makes no difference either in the<br/>
damage taken or the amount of resistance lowered.<br/>
