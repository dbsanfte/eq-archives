<div id="ygrps-yiv-932424015">Levels after hell levels (31, 36, 41, 46) are the levels you lose a<br/>
whole bubble of xp.<br/>
<br/>
I only experienced this at level 46th.  A friend did at 31.<br/>
Don&#39;t die at these levels.<br/>

&gt; When is it that you are supposed to loose a whole bubble or more of XP?  I<br/>
&gt; try not to die as much as possible, but I have an affinity for dying in the<br/>
&gt; hell levels... A LOT.  I&#39;ve never seen more then a 3/4 of a bubble of lost<br/>
&gt; XP each time and usually it is lot less than that.  I was originally told<br/>
&gt; that whole bubbles are at 31 but I&#39;m beginning to think that is a tale used<br/>
&gt; to scare children away from the 30&#39;s :-).   Then again, the concept of<br/>
&gt; random XP loss certainly seems to make a lot of sense as well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I noticed a similar thing this weekend as well.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; 30th level now.  However, I died twice in level 29<br/>
&gt; &gt; while approaching 30.  Neither time did I lose more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than a quarter bubble of health.  In level 30 I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; died twice and I think I&#39;ve lossed maybe an eighth of<br/>
&gt; &gt; a bubble each time.  Has anyone died lately that isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a hell level?<br/>
