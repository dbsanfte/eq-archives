&gt; &gt;   I sit and stare at my everquest monitor at work, thinking how<br/>
&gt; &gt;   in the hell are 15,000 people playing this game at 11am in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   morning, souldnt they be asleep, at school, or at work???  We<br/>
&gt; &gt;   don&#39;t have that many people who play from Europe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d be interested in knowing the actual numbers, though.  I was sitting <br/>
&gt; in a group in Highkeep once, thinking to myself that their spelling and <br/>
&gt; grammar was somewhat lacking, so I asked where they were from.  Tokyo, <br/>
&gt; Hong Kong, Bern, Paris and Geneva.  Pretty cool.  Then there was the <br/>
&gt; group that insisted on &quot;talking&quot; French - they were all from Quebec.  <br/>
&gt; hehe<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As well, you can list people who work shift work, shut ins, people with<br/>
disabilities that can&#39;t work at all. A friend of mine who works nights<br/>
had two people he played with who were both semi-paralysed in real life.<br/>
Everquest gave them a chance to play a character who had full freedom of<br/>
movement, at least vicariously, and I think that&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>
