I know Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura works on removing Damage Shields and <br/>
other buffs on mobs as I used it last night in Sol A.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re trying to strip your own enchantments with Alenia&#39;s <br/>
Disenchanting Melody. I know this used to clear my dark elf illusion.<br/>
<br/>
I just logged on and tested it and it worked fine. Did my inkie illusion, <br/>
then started up Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody and it cleared it.<br/>

&gt;Now in the past the only thing i used to dispel on myself was dark elf<br/>
&gt;illusion...  Were we able to dispell our buffs in the past with our song?<br/>
&gt;or has this changed since last patch?  I could not dispell clarity, i tried<br/>
&gt;multiple times, morphed into DE form, was able to dispell that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just curious<br/>
