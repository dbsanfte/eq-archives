&gt; PLEASE do not fall into this trap. I personally do not care about so-called<br/>
&gt; &quot;spoilers&quot;. I would not be reading this list if I did not want info about<br/>
&gt; the game. The game absurdly poorly documented, making things like this list<br/>
&gt; a god send. Here I can learn things that otherwise would take me pointless<br/>
&gt; hours of frustration that could be spent actually having fun in the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just so you all know, the only reason I asked for it to be emailed privately<br/>
was that since this is a bard list, I assumed people wouldn&#39;t want a lot of<br/>
off-topic smith stuff here, that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
If you read my posts, you know I&#39;m not anti-spoiler (though I think it should<br/>
be labelled as such).<br/>
