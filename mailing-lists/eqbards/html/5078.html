<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-123235319">Now I didn&#39;t say that Charisma had absolutely no effect. One of the main<br/>
attributes for a bard is charisma and it is rumored, or solidified by now,<br/>
that charisma provides our mana for the Dirge. It is also said to be<br/>
important in our chances to successfully sing a song and maybe the duration<br/>
of effects. What Brad said was that your charisma does not factor in at all<br/>
in the chance that the MOB will resist some or all of the effect. All I know<br/>
is that I got a lot more missed notes after donning the ribcage, yet my<br/>
bellows were still doing max damage almost all of the time.<br/>
	And you are not believing that Brad knows what he is saying or that I<br/>
actually talked with him Thursday night? =)<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)I&#39;m really finding this hard to believe.  What is the point<br/>
8)of having Charisma the<br/>
8)primary statistic for bards and enchanters if the only effect<br/>
8)it has in game is better<br/>
8)prices with merchants?  I wish J.M. was still around to<br/>
8)answer the question to this<br/>

8)        That&#39;s another thing that Brad told us last night.<br/>
8)Charisma has nothing to<br/>
8)do with MOB&#39;s resisting magic.<br/>
