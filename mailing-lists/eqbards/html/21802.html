<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176858604">I agree except on the LUllaby part.  The numerical effects of having<br/>
resistance rolls every 12 seconds made it far less powerful even back before<br/>
the nerf.  I could reasonably keep 3 mobs mezz&#39;d but would get all the<br/>
damage even from the primary target mob if I did nothing else, the enchanter<br/>
could keep the same 3 mobs mezz&#39;d and not take damage from the primary and<br/>
still be ready to do other things as needed.  I was never the first choice<br/>
for mezzing even then, the enchanter always was first choice.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, one reversed from long ago, they should just make Lullaby an<br/>
instrument only song.  That would prevent much of the possible abuse and<br/>
also be more in line with bardic concepts in general.  I forget now who<br/>
originally came up with the idea, but if they changed all the mez line to be<br/>
like this, and changed back the resist rates I&#39;d be satisfied at this point.<br/>
At least then I would have a choice.  Maybe we should organize something to<br/>
suggest this very option.  It is definitely a face saving way to change<br/>
their minds if Verant is interested in such a thing.  They would look good<br/>
to the bardic community by giving us some of what we want, but still look<br/>
good to everyone else by saying &quot;we didn&#39;t give them the same power they had<br/>
before, but we made a true compromise&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps something along these lines would work.  This would give back much<br/>
of what was lost, and come to think of it actually force the bard to be more<br/>
defined than ever.  Thoughts?<br/>

I can&#39;t disagree on this at all. As a matter of fact, I was going to put <br/>
the very words in my post &quot;why have them at all?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I ever use pixie strike right now is to interrupt spell <br/>
casters. It&#39;s pretty effective in that regard. It&#39;d be very powerful it it <br/>
would stun the mob, but maybe it&#39;d be too powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby would be an extremely powerful song if it worked even close to the <br/>
enchanter&#39;s AOE spell. At it&#39;s present state it really only is an AOE <br/>
taunt. :-P  Verant is looking at the play balance issues and I respect <br/>
that. But if they believe that the only way to keep play balance is to make <br/>
the resists so high and the duration so iffy, then I agree, why have this <br/>
song in the first place? They say that this song is working as they see <br/>
fit. I can see why they wouldn&#39;t want bards running rampant in a dungeon <br/>
keeping everything mez&#39;d. But I can&#39;t see why any bard would ever use this <br/>
song then.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Verant should think of adding their &quot;mana&quot; component to this song <br/>
and increasing our chances of mezing with Lullaby? That may take care of <br/>
their worries about bards running nilly willy mezing everything in sight?<br/>
