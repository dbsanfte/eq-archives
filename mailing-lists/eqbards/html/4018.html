<div id="ygrps-yiv-881807706">I&#39;ve noticed this phenomenum a lot in Unrest lately, and I&#39;ve heard people<br/>
here talking about it before.<br/>
I&#39;ve been peacefully sitting up against the wall, minutes after a battle<br/>
healing my party up and strange things happen.  <br/>
<br/>
Picture this: There I am resting quietly, 100 feet away from the house.<br/>
*Creaaak*, opens the door.  A dry bones skeleten is standing there, takes a<br/>
look around, spots me out of a crowd of 30 camped players sitting against<br/>
the wall, and makes a b-line for me.  We handily dispatched him and all got<br/>
a good laugh.  30 seconds later.  *Creaaak*, opens the door.  A reanimated<br/>
hand is standing there, sniffs the air, spots me again and makes a run for<br/>
me, completely ignoring everyone else.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.<br/>
<br/>
This happened four or five times before we were forced to zone.  My puller<br/>
was pretty happy that his job was so easy, until a flock of GDBs came<br/>
running and we had to run.  I hadn&#39;t even been into the house that night to<br/>
stir anything up.  This has happened to me on several occasions.  Its pretty<br/>
funny as long as its something you can handle, but a pair of hags hunting me<br/>
down for no apparent reason isn&#39;t a pretty sight.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, life as a bard :)<br/>

Well, one thing I like about this group is you all<br/>
actually LIKE playing a bard.  That may sound silly<br/>
but a lot of message boards out there are just<br/>
whinning about the class.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I had heard about the &#39;tauting&#39; effects of our<br/>
songs, but for the most part, it never bothered me,<br/>
sure I get the mobs attention, and even take a lot of<br/>
dammage, no biggie, just make nice with the cleric. <br/>
Well, after turning 21, Guk and Unrest have become<br/>
whole new places.  <br/>
<br/>
First guk, near the scryer room my party of six where<br/>
bashing every froglock in sight, gaining massive exp<br/>
and loot.  So we say, what the heck, lets go in the<br/>
room.  Well, on knight comes after us, so I use my<br/>
melodic binding song that I love so much.  Big<br/>
mistake, from behind one of our tanks I saw no less<br/>
than 15 assorted froglocks come up the stairs, and who<br/>
do you think they were headed for?  Well, after about<br/>
5 minutes of root, root, root, root, I was taking the<br/>
long walk back from freeport.  Get back, grab my<br/>
stuff, play anthem for my friends in battle, and what<br/>
do you think happened?  Again, I&#39;m dragged down under<br/>
a sea of amphibious flesh.  So after a while, I say,<br/>
heck, I&#39;ll head over to good ole unrest, what could be<br/>
safer?  Get there, find some good friends I could<br/>
trust, and we get to slayin undead.  One of the dry<br/>
bones makes a run for the house, silly bard that I am,<br/>
I chase him, again, still singing a song, forget which<br/>
one.  Withing seconds the doors fly open and carrion,<br/>
monks and the reclusive ghoul magi beeline right at<br/>
the wide eyed me, who didn&#39;t even have time to type in<br/>
a profanity.  So I come back from butchers block. <br/>
Fighting a while, see a wisp to the left of the house,<br/>
facing the back.  Someone in my guild needed a light<br/>
stone, so I run to grab it, while singing my little<br/>
anthem.  All of a sudden, the hag 3 floors up starts<br/>
casting on me from a window, and I wake up at home<br/>
among the trees.  That sucked.  Does this mean we<br/>
can&#39;t use any of our aoe or buffs anywhere near a<br/>
dungeon?  Well, at least my calves are built up from<br/>
zone running :)<br/>
