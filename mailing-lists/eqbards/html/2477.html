<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242858326"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Anyway, with the few remaining points I have, where do you guys and gals<br/>
&gt; suggest I put them? Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity is important<br/>
&gt; for playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does it actually<br/>
&gt; increase the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>
&gt; frequently you miss a note?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dexterity AND Charisma determine how much mana you have. Only one song at the<br/>
moment uses mana, so this isnt actually such a big deal. If I had to choose<br/>
between Agi and Dex, I&#39;d choose Dex. Dexterity supposedly factors in how well<br/>
you hit. Agility factors in how well you avoid being hit. Usually in a group,<br/>
you&#39;ll have a tank. Trust me, bards cant tank at higher levels. However, you<br/>
will be swinging your weapon, while someone else is taking the damage. So<br/>
it&#39;d be more beneficial if you missed less often, than if you had higher Agi<br/>
for those times you find yourself tanking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>
&gt; steelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t want to be in a<br/>
&gt; constant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to be safe, but I<br/>
&gt; was thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into dexterity and<br/>
&gt; agility).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have full plate. A mixture of some rubicite, and store-bought steel and<br/>
other miscellaneous magic items. My weight with weapons (light weight<br/>
weapons, mind you), food, and instruments comes to about 66. I&#39;d suggest you<br/>
have a base strength of 90 minimum and put extra points into charisma and<br/>
dexterity. Later on, you&#39;ll get elf-hide gloves and a troll-hide belt.<br/>
Combined, these items will raise str, sta, agi, and dex each by 5.<br/>
Also I try to get my strength up as much as possible. I have a bunch of +str<br/>
items which have raised it from my base of 85 to 116. I get extra dmg bonuses<br/>
which is really cool, especially with Anthem playing during battle.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
