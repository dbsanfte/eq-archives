 </span></blockquote>  If you like I&#39;ll post pictures of a greater kobold, a fire giant,<br/>
  a undead froglok, a froglok, a fire goblin, and an ice goblin.<br/>
<br/>
  Pictures of Vox and Nagafen I have were taking by someone else.<br/>
  Probably someone using bind sight or a guide snapping off picts.<br/>
<br/>
  Hmm... maybe I can sneak in and get some picts of vox with bind<br/>
  sight... after all you can target her from the king room heheh.<br/>
