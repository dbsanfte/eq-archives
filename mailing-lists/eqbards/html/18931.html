<b>Subject:</b> Have Prices gotten out of hand <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-219613641">Last night a 51 Wizard from my guild mentioned that he had a friend (non-Bard) selling singing armor.  I asked him what the guy wanted per piece and he said 8K.  I think this is absolutetly outragoes.  I mentioned to my wiz that I heard on this list some people mentioned 5k-6k and others even 1.5-2.  He said he thought prices were higher on Xegony than other servers.<br/>
<br/>
    Anyway - I know we ahve some people here from Xegony - and am curious about people&#39;s opinions in general  on this subject...<br/>
