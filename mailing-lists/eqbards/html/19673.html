<div id="ygrps-yiv-122025796">While I agree that this is a load of hoey, I have different reasoning <br/>
than Rokken.<br/>
<br/>
The commonly accepted way that exp is divided for groups is based on <br/>
the total player exp compared to total group exp.  Go to one of the <br/>
following for more info:<br/>

A Troll SK will have more total EXP at the same level as a Halfling <br/>
Warrior, thus will receive a bigger slice of the pie.  Since he needs <br/>
more exp to level, their exp bars will actually move at the same <br/>
rate, while grouped.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 reasons why I believe this is a load of hoey, and first <br/>
of all, let me state that both Dark Elves and Half Elves have the <br/>
exact same class modifier so Bards wouldn&#39;t notice anything even IF <br/>
this were true.<br/>
<br/>
1.  If the illusion did anything, it would change how much exp is <br/>
needed to level, because THAT is where the exp penalty is applied <br/>
(kind of what I read Rokkenn as saying).  So, say a Troll SK at Level <br/>
41 used an Illusion: Halfling Warrior (I know it doesn&#39;t exist, but I <br/>
actually know that a 41 Troll SK has the same total EXP as a 50 <br/>
Halfling Warrior).  The exp level tables would change, the troll SK <br/>
would keep the same total exp and he&#39;d ding into 50.  Obviously, this <br/>
isn&#39;t happening.  His exp bar would move faster while the illusion <br/>
was on, but as soon as it wore off, the tables would reset and he&#39;d <br/>
lose 9 levels again.<br/>
<br/>
2.  IF a Troll SK could bypass the EXP penalty by using the DE <br/>
Illusion you all know for a fact that Verant wouldn&#39;t have introduced <br/>
a new Guise, they would have changed the old guise to work the way <br/>
the new one does.  This would create such an imbalance, it would fit <br/>
nicely into the category of &quot;Nerf as soon as possible&quot;<br/>
