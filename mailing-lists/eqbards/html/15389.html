<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601560424">Well, after talking to some guild friends last night (while we were in PoF<br/>
clearing stuff prior to smooshing a dracoliche), turns out that some necros<br/>
were doing mana transfers, dueling down and doing it again.  Guess they<br/>
(verant) wanted to cut off unlimted sources of mana.<br/>
<br/>
Dunno about the casters binding nearby and such.  That&#39;s a pretty common<br/>
tactic for dragon runs.  Bind in the lair.  Chain cast your ice comets. Die<br/>
(no need to duel down - Naggy or Vox will usually oblige.) Mem fast and cast<br/>
nekkid.<br/>

p.s. I left a bit after midnight after the draco died.  I guess the rest of<br/>
the folks were pumped up.  Heard they stayed til 8am this morning and<br/>
smooshed CazT too.  He dropped &quot;that damn flute&quot; - gratzi to Kaldivar!<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. got feared once but lived thru the draco fight!  woo hoo!  Berzerker<br/>
& Niv&#39;s. I got hit with some enchanter spell (Shiftless deeds?) and had<br/>
Disenchanting memmed so I F1&#39;d and disspelled.  I was using it to try to<br/>
disspell mobs with damage shields too - I think it was working judging from<br/>
the messages<br/>

&gt; &gt; My problem with this explanation is that most other changes like this to<br/>
&gt; &gt; were done just to the PvP servers, not every server. Why was this done<br/>
&gt; &gt; to all the servers to address a problem specific to the PvP servers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My guess is since casters can be bound anywhere, they&#39;d bind<br/>
&gt; themselves nearby (in a safe spot), group would fight mob,<br/>
&gt; caster would unload mana, pre-arranged duel friend would kill<br/>
&gt; caster, caster would respawn with full mana and join the fight<br/>
&gt; again. </span></blockquote></div>
