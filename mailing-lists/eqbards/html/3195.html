&gt; &gt; Ok you&#39;ve all convinced me.  Plus I got to actuall see one.  But I need <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; know one thing.  What is the right price to pay for a Dragoon Dirk?  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; best place to get them is Felwithe right?  Its my understanding that <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt; &gt; come from crushbone.  Any help would be greatly appriciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve seen them going from 10 to 100 plat, honestly.  Twenty plat is <br/>
&gt;probably a<br/>
&gt;fair price for one though.  See if you can get it for less though by going<br/>
&gt;right to the source!  I bet there are people camping Dvinn in Crushbone who<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t loot another one until they sell the one they&#39;re carrying, and would <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;anxious to sell it quickly if someone had the cash.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  20 is a great price for this item... I had to pay nearly 40pp for mine... <br/>
Though, if you developed piercing the Dirk is much better than a Combine LS. <br/>
  I plan to carry a Combine LS and a Dirk at Level 17.<br/>
