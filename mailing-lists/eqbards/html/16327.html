<div id="ygrps-yiv-736310830">That&#39;s good info to have.  Do to lack of a reliably available snarer, I<br/>
haven&#39;t done as many dungeons as I&#39;d like to.  I missed the guild trip to<br/>
Unrest 3 weeks ago, which was good since they all died at least 4 times.  We<br/>
are doing a major guild outing to Sol A to try the Predator, our scouting<br/>
expedition went well except for when the lava elemental wandered by.  We<br/>
suspect we were feign trained as when the corpse recovery team got back to<br/>
the room it was camped by another group.  Since the CR team was only gone<br/>
the length of time it took to run back from their gate point on the Sol B<br/>
zoneline, it was awfully convenient.  Especially since one of their number<br/>
was a monk that two members were sure they saw dead as they ran towards the<br/>
zoneline.<br/>

That&#39;s generally true outdoors where the named mobs show up in<br/>
place of a random placeholder.  Oncylus Ogrefiend for example,<br/>
the named cyclops, is like level 42 while normal cyclopses are<br/>
in the high 20s.  And you have the minotaur hero who shows up<br/>
in place of the L7ish mino slavers.  Because of the random<br/>
location of the outdoor mobs, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re designed<br/>
to be killed by people who are hunting the normal mobs there.  <br/>
Rather, they&#39;re designed to keep the people hunting the normal<br/>
mobs from getting too complacent.<br/>
<br/>
Indoors where the named mobs show up in set spots, they are<br/>
tougher, but definitely killable by a group able to hold the<br/>
room.<br/>
