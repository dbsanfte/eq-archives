&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m having a bit <br/>
&gt; of a problem figuring out what to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a<br/>
&gt; lot of <br/>
&gt; discussion on the list about this song, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually in relation to levels far above mine. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been meaning to <br/>
&gt; write this since I got the darn song,<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; First, my experience with Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious<br/>
&gt; Lament.  When I first <br/>
&gt; got that song it didn&#39;t work for me at<br/>
&gt; &gt; all.  Always resisted.  Consistently got mobbed. <br/>
&gt; But as I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; leveled, it&#39;s become more useful.  I really<br/>
&gt; &gt; only try to use it on blues and I&#39;m having a very<br/>
&gt; good success rate <br/>
&gt; (knock on wood).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Then I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament<br/>
&gt; was when I first <br/>
&gt; got it because I can&#39;t see when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden<br/>
&gt; surrounded.  I pick a small <br/>
&gt; group of blues.  Run up and turn on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No<br/>
&gt; &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot; <br/>
&gt; message.  Then they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>
&gt; &gt; me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Can someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong<br/>
&gt; or if this song <br/>
&gt; just really sucks that bad?  Should I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use<br/>
&gt; it?  But then I <br/>
&gt; thought I recalled from previous<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion that it&#39;s completely useless after<br/>
&gt; level 24? or 27?  So <br/>
&gt; why bother for just a few levels of<br/>
&gt; &gt; use?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any advice.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lyressa - level 17<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nameless<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; p.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; have to give him a <br/>
&gt; piece of my mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>
&gt; &gt; soundly on the butt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
