<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293543798">From my roomate (a 34 shadowknight).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The mana upgrade was nice, gives me enough mana to solo much more reliably<br/>
(though it is still a awful way to get xp).  It also gives me the potential<br/>
to drop DOT&#39;s on several mobs in a big fight, keeping them taunted on me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it would seem to help paladins the most (since the ability to<br/>
cast an extra gheal or two is pretty big (or stun for an extra 30 seconds),<br/>
but this was a meaningful upgrade to them, thus they could not have been<br/>
balanced both before and after.  (I tend to fall on the side that high level<br/>
hybrids were underpowered and now are pretty comprable to mellees).<br/>
<br/>
I was happy they upgraded hybrids, I&#39;m pretty much happy when they upgrade<br/>
anyone, as if it doesnt increase my power, it increases my teamates.  (No<br/>
PvP for me here).  I just wonder why they cannot admit when things are wrong<br/>
or need to be changed.</div>
