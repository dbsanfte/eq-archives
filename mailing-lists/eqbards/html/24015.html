<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516645867">No not always, but there is little reason to believe that personal<br/>
preferences would not balance out and cancel each other out.  There should<br/>
be an approx equal number of people who choose not to play bards because<br/>
they are boring as choose not to play necros because they are boring.  etc.<br/>
etc.  The only factors that should not balance out over a large sample are<br/>
those which result from reward differential, because everyone playing the<br/>
game does so to be entertained on some level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
no, we&#39;re simply debating the basis for a choice, not the choice itself.  i<br/>
maintain<br/>
that choices are not always based on a reward given to work required<br/>
comparison.<br/>
and if they are not, then your argument stating that bards are underpowered<br/>
because<br/>
they have fewer people playing them is not a valid argument.<br/>
