<div id="ygrps-yiv-568582753">Trolls definitely, threatened to eat me they did!  But I went in pretty far<br/>
and the only non-green I saw was a Shin warrior and a Gaz Shaman.  Maybe a<br/>
party had just traipsed thru, but there were only 5 people there.  3 30+<br/>
people, a lvl 9 troll and me at 15th.  No party opportunities there.  Went<br/>
back and saw 12 people.  6 over 30 again, a party of Trolls, all very evil,<br/>
around 20, 2 dark elves at 16 and me.  I understand there are higher level<br/>
froggies farther in, but what good are the other ones as no one hunts them.<br/>
And no, being a tailor and therefore generally poor, woven isn&#39;t trash loot<br/>
to me.  Mesh is what I was really after to replace all my leather until I<br/>
get reinforced made.  Yah right, in my dreams.<br/>

Have you been far in?  It is a *huge* dungeon.  Most of the<br/>
mobs that give special items in GuK are high teens to mid 20s,<br/>
with a few up into the 30s.  My friends and I got decimated in<br/>
there when we first tried it at L17-19.  A couple nights ago,<br/>
my L21-26 group of six had a moderately easy time getting to<br/>
the froglok lord room, but had to turn around there because of<br/>
the multiple yellow/red frogs (to me at 26) that were inside.  <br/>
The frogloks at the entrance have mostly trash loot (though I<br/>
suppose woven armor might not be considered trash).<br/>
<br/>
In Paw, the special items come from low to mid teen mobs, and<br/>
the dungeon is not very close to any of the newbie city zones.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; me.  I&#39;d say 7th would be good for the outer rooms, but<br/>
&gt; what 7th level character is likely to be running thru<br/>
&gt; Oasis and S Ro?<br/>
<br/>
Um, trolls maybe?  :-)<br/>
