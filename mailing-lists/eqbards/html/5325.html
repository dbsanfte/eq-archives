this weapon. As far as it being a novelty, well look at it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting that you&#39;d say this... ratio wise, I believe the writhing staff<br/>
(9/33) is the same as an ashenwood short spear, silvery war axe or silvery<br/>
scimitar (all 6/22) -- and it procs a 48 damage effect, which none of the<br/>
others<br/>
do.  It is also purely better than the claws (5/21) from a ratio<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know that there are slow ratios and there are fast ratios... and that<br/>
a<br/>
9/33 will actually do less damage than a 6/22 over most fights, but when you<br/>
add<br/>
in the damage from the effect, I&#39;d say they&#39;re all pretty much even.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondered why it&#39;s considered a novelty.<br/>
