I agreed with all but this point.  It&#39;s time to put Voodoo cards to bed.<br/>
They don&#39;t support 32 bit graphics (and even the new Voodoo5 spec isn&#39;t<br/>
going to.  They will run as fast but the color depth just won&#39;t be there.<br/>
In short, the folks at 3dfx need to get it in gear and quit resting on their<br/>
laurels...  16bit color is nice but with every new NVidia chip supporting 32<br/>
bit (and soon 64 bit color I suspect) 3dfx is going to wind up getting<br/>
dusted even worse than they are right now by the GeForce.  If you&#39;re running<br/>
a Voodoo card I&#39;d recommend, when you do upgrade, that you go to an NVidia<br/>
chipset or a Bitboys chipset.<br/>
<br/>
Your mileage may vary (but in this case unless something rather significant<br/>
happens over at 3dFX they&#39;re going to wind up hurting badly.<br/>
