<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695448412">I would always rather do the hasting than the enchanter, BUT I don&#39;t<br/>
like telling people what to do with their character.  I let them know I<br/>
can hast everyone, but if they still want to, I try to find other things<br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
I only get annoyed with enchanters when they start casting DD/DOT&#39;s.  To<br/>
be honest the mana effiency on those spells are pretty awful (maybe I&#39;m<br/>
wrong, I haven&#39;t played my enchanter in a LONG time).  <br/>
