<div id="ygrps-yiv-485553296">Maybe containers are different?  Had the same thing happen to me with a<br/>
backpack containing three Lore items needed for the Glowing Stein quest.<br/>
Passed the backpack to our guild enchanter and he neglected to notice that<br/>
all his inventory slots were full.  The pack fell to the ground and all the<br/>
Lore items disappeared.<br/>

immediately<br/>
picked the container up (two seconds tops - look down and click) and they<br/>
were<br/>
no longer in the container.  Yes, I verified that the Claws were actually<br/>
*in*<br/>
the container prior to performing the trade.  I didn&#39;t get hussled, I merely<br/>
dropped a container with Claws in them and they were destroyed by the game.</div>
