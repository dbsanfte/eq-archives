I tried it on the Oasis gypsies too.  They didn&#39;t even change<br/>
to amiable.<br/>

On another note, about using the song to get quests you<br/>
normally don&#39;t have access to; you can also use it to help<br/>
*complete* quests that require faction.  I&#39;m not sure if I<br/>
should /bug this (probably will and let them decide).  There<br/>
are several NPCs who won&#39;t offer you services/items until<br/>
you&#39;ve gained enough faction with them.  The song can help<br/>
shortcut it.<br/>
<br/>
No, it doesn&#39;t work on the Squad Ring.  :-)  Though my hunch<br/>
is that it can cut down considerably on the number of<br/>
necklaces and belts you have to turn in to get the ring.<br/>
