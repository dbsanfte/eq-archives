<div id="ygrps-yiv-130615047">OK - this thread isn&#39;t really bard-oriented, but here goes...<br/>
<br/>
My view on the much-debated /loc command:<br/>
<br/>
I used /loc TONS during beta when i was playing a wizard. I was new and got <br/>
lost too many times to count, wether it was finding town, finding friends, <br/>
meeting places, and especially locating my corpse. I had ranger friends who <br/>
would tell me &quot;I NEVER us /loc, I&#39;m a ranger!&quot; I thought this was strange at <br/>
the time. After a coupla months I came to learn the lay of the land and all <br/>
of the landmarks in most any particular zone very well.<br/>
<br/>
Toward the end of beta I came to use it less and less. I also switched to <br/>
playing a bard, so finding my corpse was usually never a problem.<br/>
Once you learn the world Sense Heading and knowing landmarks and zone lines <br/>
is really all you need. Many rumors went around that the /loc command would <br/>
be ripped out of the game for final, and i didn&#39;t care. I do believe it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have much to do with roleplaying, but i could care less either way <br/>
if it&#39;s ripped out. It&#39;s a tool that can be used if you want to, just like <br/>
Plate armor is there if you want to use it. If you don&#39;t like it DON&#39;T USE <br/>
IT!! There are some new people who feel they need it for things like <br/>
locating friends in a zone they aren&#39;t familiar with, finding their corpses, <br/>
etc...SO LET THEM!!<br/>
<br/>
The only times i have used /loc in final is when a party member is on follow <br/>
and it gets screwed up (as usual) due to warping/lag and we get seperated. <br/>
I&#39;ve had friends die from this - a friend of mind got seperated from me due <br/>
to lag, and was MOBBED by caster bandits in W. Karana. She came back, i <br/>
located her corpse, and she was jumped and killed AGAIN by different bandits <br/>
after getting seperated. After looting her corpse a second time and getting <br/>
seperated a third time we finally ended up using the loc command to reach <br/>
eachother as she was completely lost. I have no shame! Had she not used the <br/>
loc command to find me it was totaly possible she could have been killed yet <br/>
a third time. I&#39;m sorry, but I try to have as much fun and as little <br/>
frustration as possible in this game, and /loc has saved some frustration <br/>
from time to time (including MANY times being dumped off the boat.) Whoever <br/>
said they would rather drown than use the loc command, have &quot;fun&quot; swimming <br/>
around in OOT next time you get dunked. =) That&#39;s far from fun in my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
If I have EVER needed the /loc for a particular location I used the /ooc <br/>
channel to communicate that. If you are a hardcore roleplayer, turn ooc off. <br/>
You will see ppl use the shout channel for this for sure. My suggestion is <br/>
to DEAL with it. What are your other options at the moment? UO? Meridian 59? <br/>
Go for it! I&#39;m gonna have my &quot;fun&quot; in EQ... =)<br/>
<br/>
Safe travels to you,<br/>
