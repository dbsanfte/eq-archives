<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526110384">Try this if you are fighting bigtime casters, put on a drum and sit that<br/>
melee out, play guardian AND elemental rhythms, and see how happy everyone<br/>
is with 100+ magic resistance.<br/>
<br/>
As far as playing hymn of resotration during a fight, I was always of the<br/>
opinion that it is just not worth it, especially when not holding a<br/>
mandolin/lute.  The 5hp or so per pulse can not keep up with the dmg the<br/>
party is taking.  I say put the creature down as quickly as you can.  Maybe<br/>
until you get to 23, Anthem and 2 Bellows, while boring, is most effective<br/>
and i think that is exactly what i did.  then AFTER the fight, put on a<br/>
mandolin and heal up the party.  Once you get to 23 you will be using chain<br/>
a lot to slow down the mobs from running and their attack speed.  At level<br/>
26 having appaling screech memmed may save your life in many occassions.<br/>
Once you get to 32 you will be singing mana song a lot after fights.  At<br/>
level 36 you can stack chant of battle and celerity to give the whole party<br/>
a STR, DEX, AC, and AGI boost.  What will happen is the higher level you go,<br/>
the far less you use Heal or Bellow.  You will be grouped with players who<br/>
are blasting for 400+ dmg, so your 20 dmg or so bellow is not as important<br/>
as buffing everyone elses melee abilities.  And it is a very rare occurrence<br/>
to play heal, as there is always a cleric or druid in your party who can<br/>
heal 400+ hp in one spell, and your mana song regenerates their mana far<br/>
faster than your heal song can regen their hp.  so don&#39;t despair, there are<br/>
nice songs in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t like being &quot;ordered&quot; to do anything in a group, by leader<br/>
or other members.  They do not play a bard, therefore they can not know all<br/>
of our benefits to a party.  If the group asks and we agree on a strategy,<br/>
no problem.  but if it pisses you off like it does me to be ordered around,<br/>
just tell them &quot;next time you tell me to play that song will be the last<br/>
time i play it.&quot;  usually that shuts them up, especially if it is the mana<br/>
song =)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll also use Guardian or Elemental Rhythms if we&#39;re fighting<br/>
&gt; a spellcasting mob.  Has anyone else noticed that Elemental<br/>
&gt; Rhythms actually increases your magic resist the same as<br/>
&gt; Guardian (at least up to L20)?  The only advantage of Guardian<br/>
&gt; is that it gives me 1 extra AC, and that didn&#39;t happen until I<br/>
&gt; was L20.  Before then, Elemental was either the same or<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
