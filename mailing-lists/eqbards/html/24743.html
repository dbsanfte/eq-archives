<div id="ygrps-yiv-678539461">If you sit down you med back mana faster, I heard this on Concert Hall and<br/>
tried it myself when i was frequently using charm.  I never dropped below 60<br/>
mana...<br/>
I have not tested it myself emperically, but I was near the end of my<br/>
charming career, and the qualitative results were enough for me...<br/>
