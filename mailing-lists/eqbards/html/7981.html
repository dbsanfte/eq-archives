&gt; perosnally i think the Dev Team has done a VERY VERY poor job on the female<br/>
&gt; models. The clothing they get as newbies COULD be described as sexist and<br/>
&gt; male chauvenist crap. Why arent newbie men in lion cloths and singlets?<br/>
&gt; Also, for example, Wood Elf Ranger men look WAY better that Wood Elf Ranger<br/>
&gt; Women, they look much more like Rangers than their female counterparts.<br/>
&gt; It seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>
