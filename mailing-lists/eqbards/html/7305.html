<b>Subject:</b> Group damage - was Revised? Patch Update today <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339394109">This is very sad.  I was shocked when I found out this wasn&#39;t the way <br/>
     it worked to begin with.  Does Verant condone kill stealing?  Does <br/>
     Verant want to discourage grouping and promote obnoxious necro <br/>
     soloing?  What&#39;s the deal here?  The less people want to group the <br/>
     harder it is to be a bard...<br/>

Did they revise the patch message?  It now says the group damage getting <br/>
the exp only has been applied to the Fennin Ro server.  Those bums!  How <br/>
long have we all been waiting for this change?  *sigh*<br/>
