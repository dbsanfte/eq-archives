&gt;Talking about Dragoon Dirks, I did an /auction last night to see if anyone<br/>
&gt;had one.<br/>
&gt;Some generous guy asked me how much money I had, and all my net worth <br/>
&gt;was 15pp and a minotaur axe.  He sold me the dirk for 15pp.  Praise<br/>
&gt;Bristlebain!<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately, I do not remember this guys name to give him credit, but it<br/>
&gt;was <br/>
&gt;something like Nuntien or something...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nunatien, I think, I see him fighting DVinn all the time.  I just FINALLY<br/>
got a Trainer shield m&#39;self.  I decided that rather than purchase something<br/>
like that, I wanted to earn it.  And I did.  I&#39;m so happy =)<br/>
