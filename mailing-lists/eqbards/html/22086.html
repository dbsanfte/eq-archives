Fear is, in my experience, the easiest of the planes. Most of the mobs are<br/>
not casters and I&#39;ve never had a problem with agro there. There are several<br/>
mobs to watch out for though.<br/>
<br/>
Worry Wraiths are enchanters. They will Gravity Flux. I usually throw<br/>
guardian into the mix vs them just to make sure no one gets tossed.<br/>
<br/>
Tentacle Tormentors will AE dispell. They are highly annoying and also have<br/>
the knockback spell that Tentacle Terrors seem to delight in using against<br/>
me when I was a young bard in Najena. My guild went on Tuesday and by<br/>
singing Verses of Victory, Guardian Rythmns and Niv&#39;s my group went 6 for 7<br/>
on exp with TTs. I attribute it to us being the only group that was hasted<br/>
throughout the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Phoboplasms also dispell, but I&#39;m pretty sure they are targeted.<br/>
<br/>
Scarelings (nicknamed asslings) are annoying to fight because they run<br/>
around a lot, but they aren&#39;t that tough.<br/>
<br/>
Amygdalian Knights are casters also. They are always trying to mana drain<br/>
me, but I always seem to resist. They have skele pets.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I&#39;ll sing Guardian, Nivs and another song dependant on my group in<br/>
hate. Often times that third song is haste because we seem to be short on<br/>
enchanters. During downtime it&#39;s usually just mana song, with the occaisonal<br/>
Psalm of Vitality to shirk off disease. (from fetid fiends)<br/>
<br/>
Hate is much harder. First off, in Hate you are usually fighting in a very<br/>
small space. Shoving 30 people into a room the size of the bard&#39;s guild in<br/>
qeynos makes for some interesting fights. Secondly the mobs in Hate are much<br/>
tougher.<br/>
<br/>
As a bard the most important piece of advice I can give you is DO NOT SING<br/>
when Revenants are being pulled. Revs HATE bards. They are tough to mez and<br/>
will come after you with a vengenance. Once they are all safely mezzed you<br/>
can fire up your songs, just be careful because they will probably gun for<br/>
you when mez breaks.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the other Hate mobs don&#39;t seem to have a predilection for bards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll link you to the guide to Hate written by a guildmate of mine which<br/>
borrows from another guide written by a different friend of mine. The<br/>
descriptions of the mobs are dead on.<br/>

I have virtually no exp in air, so I&#39;ll leave that to someone else to<br/>
comment on.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I am almost ready for some plane hunting myself, and should be going<br/>
up in early November.  I have seen various bards comment about not singing<br/>
during pulls etc. while in the planes, but what I would really like is a<br/>
synopis of &quot;bard tactics&quot; while in Fear, Hate and Sky.<br/>
<br/>
A few of you guys up for the task?  Anyone...Anyone.....<br/>
