<div id="ygrps-yiv-984960796">Very good thought. I wish they would fix this, i really hate zoning in<br/>
from NFreeport to WFreeport (a spot where many guard killers pull to, i<br/>
am always apprehensive that i will get a bad faction hit just running by<br/>
a battle (as has happenned with GOOD faction MANY times).<br/>
<br/>
Here is another thing to chew on: when i was 6th level, i was killing<br/>
spiders on the plateau in NRO. After a bad fight, i ran to the guard<br/>
near the plateau, and started my hymn to heal and sat. I got<br/>
<br/>
your wounds begin to heal<br/>
your wounds begin to heal<br/>
your wounds begin to heal<br/>
<br/>
 and then i saw &quot;Stop you filty scum&quot; (or some such thing), and THE<br/>
GUARD attacked and killed me quickly. I scrolled back up to see what i<br/>
had done, and i had done NOTHING. I had ok faction with the guards, i<br/>
did not have the guard targeted, i was not in combat, and i was singing<br/>
ONLY the hymn.<br/>
<br/>
Just something that has botheered me for a while...<br/>

&gt; I actually think part of &quot;bard hate&quot; comes from a coding error (theory only). If I<br/>
&gt; am playing heal and a mob runs through our group<br/>
&gt; getting pulled to another group, I will get all the Faction +/-&#39;s for that mob<br/>
&gt; being killed. I think this was because in Beta the<br/>
&gt; bards songs affected everyone (grouped or not) within a certain radius. I think<br/>
&gt; this area effect code is still in the game but with<br/>
&gt; an additional check (i.e. in radius + in group) for PC&#39;s but for aggro mobs I<br/>
&gt; think they effectively get &quot;hit&quot; by our songs (thus we<br/>
&gt; get those faction hits for mobs we never touched). Thoughts? </span></blockquote></div>
