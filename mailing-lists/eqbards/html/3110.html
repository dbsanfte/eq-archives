<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749725264">A few weeks back I posted a question about why a druid was outrunning me<br/>
with Accelerado playing.  First off, thanks to all who responded.  I&#39;d have<br/>
said that sooner but had some email issues and so wasn&#39;t getting these<br/>
mailings for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve done some experimenting & maybe what I have to say will be of<br/>
some benefit to other newbies here.  Apologies if this has already been<br/>
covered.<br/>
<br/>
The issue was that, grouped with a lvl 7 halfling druid and being a lvl 7<br/>
wood elf bard myself, and with neither of us carrying anything (no weapons,<br/>
no armor, no food, no nada) she would continuously outrun the affects of my<br/>
song.  Racing her with no songs or spells, she still outruns me.  So we<br/>
compared pings & packets & such.  No big differences.  We compared modems.<br/>
I&#39;ve got a 56K that usually connects at 28.8, the druid&#39;s got cable modem,<br/>
but has run EQ on a 28.8 and had no problems then.  Then we compared PCs.<br/>
Mine&#39;s a P300 MMX, 64 MB RAM, 16 MB on the video.   The druid runs on dual<br/>
200s with 194 MB RAM and a similar video card.   Grrr.  Guess I&#39;ll have to<br/>
get used to being a slow poke as I haven&#39;t got a couple grand burning a hole<br/>
in my pocket at the moment to upgrade hardware.  I&#39;ve since gotten a drum,<br/>
and have challenged her to a race when next we meet, but if I group with her<br/>
it won&#39;t alter the fact that she&#39;ll outrun me without trying.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, on a related note, apparently you&#39;re not supposed to be able to do<br/>
this, but in playing around we managed to stack SOW & Accelerado.  The only<br/>
time we could get it to work though was when Accelerado went into the second<br/>
space and SOW in the third.  <br/>
