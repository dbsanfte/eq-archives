<div id="ygrps-yiv-205944438">Last night I was in a group in Highkeep and we got on the topic of dueling.  While I was running my mouth, the magician I was with challenged me to a duel.  We were the same level (29) and I said what the hell.  He had a fire elemental pet that was blue to me so I decided that the only way I would stand a chance would be to try to charm him into fighting his pet.  Well, let me just say that I thought charm was only nerfed on the PvP servers and NOT in PvP mode.  Wrong!  So I start the duel with the thought of charming him.  Hit the song, and wait, and wait, and wait... no pulse! WTF? So I try charming his pet that is now attacking me.  Resist, resist, (thinking cool, its pulsing, gonna work), charm sticks but no charm! Instead I got a message saying &#39;This NPC cannot be charmed.&#39; Dammit! NOOO!  Meanwhile, I am getting the hell nuked out of me while trying to figure out what to do next.  So I die.  I pop back up and my opponents health bar is down (still grouped) and I hear &#39;Beat, Demi is getting the sh*t kicked out of him.&#39;  Come to find out, after looting my corpse, that after I died, his pet agro&#39;d on him.  Strange charm bug is what I am assuming.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone on the list dueled a magician or a caster with a pet and won?  He was a really cool guy and I asked him for a rematch some other time.  My new tactic is just like how I would fight a wizzie, below him to death.  His pet wasn&#39;t hitting to hard and I think I can solo his pet by melee and songs.  So, I think I can take him by just staying on his butt and keeping his spells interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
Any other suggestions?  I am also assuming that Screech won&#39;t work either.<br/>
