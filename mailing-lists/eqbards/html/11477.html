<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137788121">Ok well my bard isn&#39;t high enough for the Fire save buff songs but some<br/>
friends of mine and I have a bet.  We are trying to find out what the least<br/>
amount of damage one can take from the Lava in Sol B is per tick.<br/>
<br/>
You see I was in the Priest room with my wizard camping with some friend<br/>
and wouldn&#39;t ya know I was bored.  Hay I am a gnome I get bored easily.<br/>
Anyway, I decided to practice my Conjuration skill by summoning eyes of<br/>
zomm and tossing them into the lava so they would die a quick death and I<br/>
could summon another.<br/>
Well to my supprise an Eye of Zomm dosen&#39;t take lava damage.  Kinda neet<br/>
but not really any practical purpse that I can find except maybe agroing a<br/>
mob on the far side of lava and creating a uber train.  But I digress<br/>
again.  So I started summoning eyes and looking around the lava.<br/>
Under the king room, yes under the lava.  There is a tunnel.  On the far<br/>
side of the tunnel you can resurface into a small room.  I could see one<br/>
Greater Kobold in the room, but I couldn&#39;t get my eye out of the lava and<br/>
on to the land.  Not sure how the GK would of gotten to me if it did agro<br/>
because I couldn&#39;t see any other way out of the room.<br/>
So now as a pet project I am trying to find out if this is some dorkey<br/>
placeholder for something because from what I can tell there is no reason<br/>
to have a GK spawn in a dead end room that can only be accessed via an<br/>
under the lava tunnel.<br/>
So now I want to go down there.  All my friends say I won&#39;t survive the<br/>
lava damage let alone the GK on the far side.<br/>
I am just curious if a High Level Bard with full Fire Resist buffs steps<br/>
into lava playing the right songs, how much damage per tick will they take?<br/>
