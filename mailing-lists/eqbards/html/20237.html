<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825695651">I probably end up leading about 1/4 of the time, more when I&#39;m in pickup groups, <br/>
less in guild events.  I really would prefer not to have to; leadership requires <br/>
a fair amount of direction-giving during fights, and that interferes with <br/>
song-weaving.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as much of a problem when my warrior leads, for <br/>
example.<br/>

&gt; make us excellent leaders and I often find people want ME to lead the group,<br/>
&gt; or if they don&#39;t ask and I find myself in a group that lacks clear<br/>
&gt; leadership I gradually just assume the role even if I wasn&#39;t the one to do<br/>
