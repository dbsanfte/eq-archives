<div id="ygrps-yiv-397304779">That is why I hunt where I do now. but it is rare to find a group for where<br/>
I like to hunt. because it is out of peoples &quot;Safety zones&quot;. They like to<br/>
follow the quick and easy path. Wish I could have been there with you back<br/>
in the day, but, I didnt have the time to put in that you did, and I was<br/>
never in a rush.=) I still am not, though I wish I could reach level 28<br/>
sometime soon.<br/>

<br/>
camping/list wise it was great back then, cause it was one or two groups in<br/>
<br/>
the zone tops.  and then we just moved on until the avatar and by then my<br/>
<br/>
exp was maxing for the zone and i was tired of losing rubi bp lottos, so i<br/>
<br/>
moved on to sol B for the rest.  was the only group there too.  i love those<br/>
<br/>
days.  the difference between waiting 8 hours to get in the king hall group<br/>
<br/>
and not finding enough people to START a king hall group.<br/>
