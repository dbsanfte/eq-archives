<div id="ygrps-yiv-102576196">I was deep in Kedge last night with some of my guildmates (druid 50, ranger <br/>
49, cleric 49, ranger 43, warrior 45, and me - the singin&#39; fool of 37 songs) <br/>
when we got a distress call.  Seems a Nagafen raid was in the planning <br/>
stages when someone&#39;s pet went and aggro&#39;d the big lizard.  Well, the dookie <br/>
hit the rotating blades, and in the mass confusion one of our guildmates <br/>
died at the feet of the red monstrosity.  The leader of the raid, Shangra <br/>
Kai, sent out a call for help, and we went in to get our guildmate&#39;s body <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
We group gated to Lavastorm and buffed up.  I made a hotkey bank of melee 2; <br/>
inventory slot for instrument; hymn; clarity; elemental rhythms; guardian <br/>
rhythms, equipped my MM drum and put my mandolin in the backup slot, and <br/>
went in.<br/>
<br/>
The place was chaos... people were milling about trying to get ready for an <br/>
assault.  The plan was to go rush in as two waves.  We were in the second <br/>
wave, and everyone but the cleric and I were going in.  My job was to stay <br/>
by her and keep her alive and full of mana so she could heal the suicides... <br/>
err... valiant warriors.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the first wave went in, and I stayed by the teeth (stalactites and <br/>
stalagmites around a tunnel entry that look like a huge gaping maw) with the <br/>
cleric.  I wove elemental, guardian, clarity with no problem - my lag was <br/>
not bad at all, all things considered.  With a magic resist around 140, I <br/>
resisted all 5 dragon fears (at level 37 mind you) with no difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
Then things got ugly.  The first wave was down, and the second wave rushed <br/>
in.  Party members started dropping like flies, and soon it was just the <br/>
cleric and I.  People were running back and forth, and I lost sight of her <br/>
for a minute - next thing I knew she was dead, and it was just me.  Now, <br/>
mind you, I was around the corner, being as innocuous as possible... but to <br/>
no avail.  I heard something that sent a chill down my spine.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Nagafen says, &quot;You will not evade me Aloro&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pop! I&#39;m standing there looking up at... Wow, he&#39;s a big one.  Hey, nice <br/>
claws you got there, Mr. Dragon Sir.  Then the survival instinct kicked in <br/>
and I made a blind dash for the exit...<br/>
<br/>
Lord Nagafen claws YOU for 225 damage.<br/>

LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br/>

Well, I sat in Freeport for a bit, and heard some bad news.  Seems after all <br/>
the second wave died, nobody was fighting Naggy for a few minutes, and he <br/>
healed back to full.  While I waited in Freeport, my poor cleric died two <br/>
more times trying to help people.  Eventually two people made kamikaze runs <br/>
to pull corpses out.  I got ressed back, and the raid was called off - too <br/>
late, lots of disgruntled people had to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was chaotic, messy, and a lot of fun.  Sure, it would have <br/>
been nice if we hadn&#39;t all died (some of us several times) but it was quite <br/>
an experience. I got a lot of screenshots of everything BUT Naggy - when I <br/>
was right there in front of him I didn&#39;t have the presence of mind to shoot, <br/>
just to run.<br/>
<br/>
The bards made a good show of it, by the way.  Demari was there, as were <br/>
Tallon, Asleif, Metrini, and a few others (all 45+ - I was the only yougster <br/>
crazy and stupid enough to get dragged in there).  It was fun watching all <br/>
the flashing lights as bards played for their respective parties - we put on <br/>
quite a lightshow while standing outside waiting to go in.<br/>
<br/>
On a lighter note, several of us went to Cazic later and held the AoF room <br/>
for a couple of hours.  During that time I dinged into 38. = )<br/>
