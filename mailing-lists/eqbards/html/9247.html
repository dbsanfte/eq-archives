<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-955144430">When attempting to lament a mob thats is a higher level than the bard, whats<br/>
the maximum level difference that a bard can reliably lament the mob?  I<br/>
would assume that the reliability against yellow mobs is pretty good but<br/>
against reds its pretty risky.  Anyone done in testing in this area?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
