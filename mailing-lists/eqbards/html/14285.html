<div id="ygrps-yiv-962044367">Harmonic - I agree with most of what you are posting.  IMHO - what we<br/>
are pretty much are seeing is an &quot;immature&quot; Software Company.  Unforuntately<br/>
Verant is making the same mistakes that we ahve seen over and over again in<br/>
the Computer Game industry.<br/>
<br/>
    Those of us who are in their late 30&#39;s+ and have been playing computer<br/>
games know this.  Especially if you played early Massively-Multiplayer games<br/>
(I did a lot on GEnie in the early 90&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
    Every mistake they are making; from lack of QA, to thinking they know<br/>
better in game design; to bad patches, etc etc etc is typical.  It&#39;s sad<br/>
that with the exception of the PvP issue they learned little if anything<br/>
from the predescessors.<br/>
<br/>
    It sure is nice paying $10/month and not $6.00/hour (I&#39;m not kidding -<br/>
that&#39;s what we paid back then - plus a per-minute charge to the phone<br/>
company - there were very few dialins) - but it is frustrating<br/>
none-the-less.<br/>
<br/>
    What&#39;s particularly frustrating - is there is a lot they can do to<br/>
improve it - at least on the testing side.  It&#39;s obvious their internal<br/>
training staff is woefully inadequate.  And full-time inhouse testers aren&#39;t<br/>
cheap - and we understand the economic reality for a company owned by a<br/>
large corporation.  But what&#39;s ridiculous about it - they could easily get<br/>
consumer to do TONS of testing for them for very little money.<br/>
<br/>
    Sure they have a test-server.  But how much info is provided on what<br/>
changes have gone in to test it?  How many people really want to build a<br/>
character there. And it&#39;s ridiculous to CHARGE people to test it for you.<br/>
<br/>
    Why not give free accounts to people that ONLY let you log into the Test<br/>
Server.  Require these people to file weekly bug reports.  And provide them<br/>
with DETAILED information on what changes are going on.  Let them import<br/>
chars from live servers - or have a character building tool to let them test<br/>
different classes and Levels (But DON&#39;T give them a different client!  Make<br/>
this tool a seperate executable).<br/>
<br/>
    Anyway - this is a ramble.  Yes Verant has a great product.  Yes they<br/>
deserve a lot of credit for what they&#39;ve done.  But it&#39;s really sad that<br/>
they have to make the same mistakes everyone else has.  And the marketplace<br/>
is limited enough that they won&#39;t have to pay for this mistake until some<br/>
competitor comes along with a better product...<br/>
