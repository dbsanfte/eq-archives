&gt; Lol heh even before they twinked fear it was dangerous to go there and to<br/>
&gt; kill the big guys in zone they need to move it back to the wya it was before<br/>
&gt; and lower the level cap to 40+.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about lowering the cap, but, I think this was a typical<br/>
Verant reaction to powergamers (of which I was one) Basically, the zone<br/>
was really tough before, even when you took 2 or 3 groups as one party.<br/>
You still had a damn good chance of many people dying and then spending<br/>
a few hours on corpse recovery.<br/>
<br/>
But, a lot of us play(ed) 12+ hours a day. We could afford to take the<br/>
losses and still come out of the zone after a few days with what Verant<br/>
considered to be &quot;easy&quot; loot. So they nerfed it. However, unlike the way<br/>
they nerfed the dragons, which we can still go kill, if we put a good<br/>
enough bunch of people together and have a leader who can keep things<br/>
together, they managed to nerf it so you don&#39;t even have a chance to<br/>
zone in before you are dead. That&#39;s just, IMO, sloppy work.<br/>
<br/>
OB Bard so this doesn&#39;t get kabonged. Almost the only bard only items in<br/>
the game are in PoF. Other than the drum, isn&#39;t anyone else just a<br/>
little bummed out at the dearth of bard specific items? We used to at<br/>
least share some of the cool rogue daggers, but they took that away from<br/>
us and gave us nothing to make up for it. Meanwhile, after the huge<br/>
warrior protest a while back, you can&#39;t even kill a firebeetle without<br/>
finding some new warrior only armor or weapon. What&#39;s up with that? Do<br/>
we have to yell and scream until our faces turn blue to get any<br/>
attention at all?<br/>
