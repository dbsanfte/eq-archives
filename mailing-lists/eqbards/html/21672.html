names) were real easy. Just chant them to death. The casters were pretty <br/>
nasty though.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the jail you must have invisibility. You enter it through the <br/>
secret door behind the crypt in the graveyard. Once you get in, you&#39;ll see <br/>
4 doors. There are also 2 other secret passages in this room. The wall to <br/>
the right has a passage that leads down and will be your safe healing area. <br/>
The 3 doors to your left are the cells. The 1 door straight ahead is the <br/>
switch to open the cells. To the left of this door is another secret <br/>
passage with stairs leading up to the tower. It is on this passage that the <br/>
avenging caitliff spawns (which is a very nice mob for both completing the <br/>
Wakizashi quest as well as for their loot (crested spaulers and the very <br/>
much sought crested helm).<br/>
<br/>
At level 38-39 I could at times hold my own here, at other times I would <br/>
get so trashed. Same goes for the caitliff&#39;s placeholder. The casters are <br/>
the nasiest. I highly recommend a partner for this place. Doesn&#39;t matter <br/>
between tank or caster.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the caitliff and place holder will wander into the jail, so I <br/>
recommend you kill them before clearing the jail. Just bring them down into <br/>
the safe area and kill them.<br/>
