 </span></blockquote>For me, it all depends on the situation.<br/>
    Once upon a time, as I was passing through EK, I happened upon Chief<br/>
San&#39;re Rex (or whatever his name is).  He was wandering along the hill near<br/>
the road to the ramp.  He had no loss on his hp bar, and I even asked on<br/>
/ooc if he was spoken for.  No one claimed him, so I decided to extract a<br/>
lil revenge on the Chief ;o)  After I killed him, I get challeneged by some<br/>
druid.<br/>
???<br/>
It turns out that this guy had been medding to get his mana up to kill him.<br/>
I apologized, and explained that I had checked to see if he was taken and no<br/>
one responded.  This guy was so irked, that he didn&#39;t care.  As far as he<br/>
was concerned, I had KS&#39;d him on purpose.  Needess to say, after about 10<br/>
minutes of accusations, being cursed out, and challenged over and over<br/>
(using this time to heal up and mem songs for PvP ;o)~  ), I accpeted his<br/>
challenge and charmed him right off the bat.  Although I was resisted a few<br/>
times, I managed to get him to where Sir Whats-His-Name and Squire Wembley<br/>
and had him attack them.  They laid the big-time smackdown on him while I<br/>
headed for the NK zone to await that lovely yellow text that told me I had<br/>
won.  He logged off not long thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
    If it had been a consentual thing (ie: &quot;Hey, you feel like dueling?&quot;), I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have done that.  If it had been a friend of mine and we were<br/>
talking trash, I wouldn&#39;t have done it.  If it had been over something<br/>
reasonable (say the named MOB in HP that drops the PGT), I wouldn&#39;t even<br/>
have accepted.  But this guy was such a complete jerk, and was *so*<br/>
antagonistic that I felt a mere defeat wasn&#39;t worthwhile.  I don&#39;t say it&#39;s<br/>
for everyone, but for me it fit the crime.  If that makes me &quot;nasty&quot;...<br/>
guilty as charged   &gt;;o)~<br/>
