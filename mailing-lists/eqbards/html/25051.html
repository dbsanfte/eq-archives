I would for sure check your interrupt settings.<br/>
Boy that problem took me some time to get rid of!<br/>
I had too many cards in my machine so:<br/>
a) Either some cards had to share interrupt<br/>
b) Or I had to remove a card.<br/>
I choose b) and removed an old ISA printer port (Dident use it anyways). I<br/>
also had to move my SB-Live from the PCI slot next to the AGP. So that slot<br/>
is now unused. Ill never take that slot into use since I learned that it<br/>
shares interrupt with the AGP!!!<br/>
Well hope you get it fixed..<br/>

P.S. I still use 98SE for my game machine and Linux on my server - I do not<br/>
have any plans to switch either..<br/>

&gt; I play on two W2K systems, my home PC (Server) and my work <br/>
&gt; notebook (Pro).<br/>
&gt; I have one nagging EQ problem that recently surfaced with the SB Live!<br/>
&gt; card. I&#39;ve reloaded it so many times I think it might be an interupt<br/>
&gt; problem. I also have seen a strange &quot;out of virtual <br/>
&gt; memory...automatically<br/>
&gt; increasing resources...&quot; message every time I play. These <br/>
&gt; only occur on<br/>
&gt; the SB system and only With EQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, the systems are rock solid and now work great with my iDSL<br/>
&gt; connection (was too far for ADSL). I just have to shut down <br/>
&gt; EQ with Task<br/>
&gt; Mgr or reboot :(.<br/>

&gt; I run W2K and it is great :) not only do I have great <br/>
&gt; performance from&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; the game, but I have a great platform to work from when not gaming<br/>
&gt; that&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; is solid as a rock.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; I am a <br/>
&gt; &quot;little&quot; biased)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I too had lots of problems with Windows ME as an upgrade to an&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; older box. (that box I updated to W2K Server and it runs great) I<br/>
&gt; received ME on a new box and have never had a single problem with it.<br/>
