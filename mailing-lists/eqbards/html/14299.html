<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612137890">Last night on E&#39;ci several 40+ players staged a Kedge raid.  A few were<br/>
friends of mine so I asked them if I was too low to come (I&#39;m a 33 bard).<br/>
They didn&#39;t have an enchanter with them so they were glad to have me along.<br/>
Someone met me in Dagnors and gave me a waterstone, see invis, and invis<br/>
buff and off we went.  When I zoned into Kedge I was truly amazed.  I only<br/>
swam through a small portion of the zone until we got to where everyone was<br/>
at but my first impression is that it is a well designed zone in terms of<br/>
layout.  <br/>
<br/>
Once we started fighting my primary role was clarity, stamina song and<br/>
anthem.  Whenever we got a caster I weaved in Elemental Rhythms.  Every once<br/>
in a while I got a Bellow to stick.  The melee damage I did was so small in<br/>
comparison to everyone else that I rarely got attacked.  However, when I did<br/>
get hit it was often for 90-100 damage.  That wasn&#39;t a big deal for the most<br/>
part though.  I dont think I ever lost more than one bub of health the<br/>
entire night. <br/>
<br/>
All in all it was a fun night.  I got to go somewhere I had never been<br/>
before.  At 33d level, I got experience with a level 47 in the group (not<br/>
much though).  I wasn&#39;t there for experience in the first place so that<br/>
wasn&#39;t a big deal.  Only thing I was disappointed about was that my swimming<br/>
skill only went up 2 points during the four hours I was there:-)  So if you<br/>
are 32+ and want to go to Kedge but were worried that you were too low in<br/>
level don&#39;t let that stop you as bards are a very valuable class in that<br/>
zone.<br/>
