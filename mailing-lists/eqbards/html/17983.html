<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320816386">At level 49, I too have had Chains and Fear wear off in an unpredictable <br/>
fashion, sometimes right after the effect takes hold.<br/>
IE A Seafury runs in terorr.   A Seafury is no longer feared.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing with chains.   I have always had this, for months and months.  My <br/>
charisma is about 120, depending on what I have equipped.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Actually I believe this must have changed this patch.  It was giving<br/>
&gt;messages as of the previous patch, but I only saw them twice when I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;re-Chain the mob.  It was always lasting for the full duration basically <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;that was on blue to yellow cons.  I was using it yesterday on green cons <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;it was wearing off early fairly often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A week ago I could keep high blue gargoyles continuously chained with a 3<br/>
&gt;song weave, yesterday I couldn&#39;t always keep mobs 10 levels below me<br/>
&gt;continuously chained.<br/>

&gt;Hey,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now that we are getting messages when our song effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;noticed that our snare song amost never lasts the full duration. Many times<br/>
&gt;it wears off as soon as I finish singing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wondering if any of you were having the same problem and whether or<br/>
&gt;not this is by design or a bug that we should bring to the attention of the<br/>
&gt;powers that be.<br/>
