<div id="ygrps-yiv-358270844">i heard it was GM event only, probably how he got it.  seems unlikely it is<br/>
still NOT lore though.  every other wep from there is.  or maybe it is<br/>
primary hand only.  i finally get a damn six note blade, and now something<br/>
better.  will it ever end?!?!<br/>

&gt; Me too me too! FSS would be so sweet. Only one person on my <br/>

&gt; the time).<br/>
