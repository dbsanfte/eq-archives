<b>Subject:</b> Falchion, EBM, or YK? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-326117429">I recently was given a Ykesha by a friend who felt sorry <br/>
for me after I camped the Frenzied ghoul for 19 hours with <br/>
no luck. :)  My previous weapons were a Runed Falchion in <br/>
primary and a Enamelled Black mace in secondary.<br/>
<br/>
Which should I replce with the YK?  I am leaning towards YK <br/>
in primary and EBM in secondary, but I realize the Falchion has <br/>
a much better ratio than the Mace, and perhaps I should indeed <br/>
go Falchion / YK.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?  Don&#39;t take solely the YK proc factor into account, I<br/>
am an AC buff and my DEX is only 114, so proc is usually just gravy, <br/>
not to be counted on.  Am I right, will the YK / EBM do better for me?<br/>
