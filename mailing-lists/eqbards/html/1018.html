<div id="ygrps-yiv-21253080">I really love playing a bard, so don&#39;t get me wrong - but in light of the<br/>
things I have been hearing on this thread it seems like maybe we should all<br/>
get together and petition Verant to throw us bards a frickin bone.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, to have to wait all that time just to get the thieving skills and<br/>
then to have them max out at 35 and 40 what use are they?<br/>
<br/>
Would you really be using the sneak skill when it is maxed at 35?  Who cares<br/>
if we never get a chance to be very good at it?<br/>
<br/>
I intend to continue playing this class and really am having a good time, I<br/>
just think in light of the circumstances there are a lot of skill that I was<br/>
excited about in the beginning that I pretty much don&#39;t even consider<br/>
anymore because they seem useless.<br/>
<br/>
Dual wield at 17 is really cool, and Bellows in place of kick is fine, but<br/>
why no dual attack?  Apparently the bardic class was VERY powerful in beta<br/>
and had to be toned down but I am thinking maybe it was toned down in the<br/>
areas that made it too powerful and forgotten about in the areas it is very<br/>
weak in.  Am I totally off base?  I mean why give me the capability to have<br/>
skills I will never be very good at?<br/>

&gt; I agree with you on most of that, and if all the other magic <br/>
&gt; classes turn<br/>
&gt; out to be the same, maybe I&#39;ll try a monk or warrior. And <br/>
&gt; alot of the really<br/>
&gt; usefull stuff that makes us versatile isnt untill the higher <br/>
&gt; levels.Disarm<br/>
&gt; Trap is 30th, Pick locks is 40th, and track is 35th....Maybe I am just<br/>
&gt; expecting to much, I dont know<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;only usefull ones. Any other magic class usually has a <br/>
&gt; variety of usefull<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;spells, and I rarely see 1 (Lets say wizrd) using the same <br/>
&gt; 4 or 5 spell<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;and over again. They switch them around considering what <br/>
&gt; the situation<br/>
&gt; calls<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gotta disagree here.  As an enchanter, I generally had a <br/>
&gt; standard &quot;spell<br/>
&gt; &gt;kit&quot; that I seldom changed.  As a Bard my song kit is much <br/>
&gt; the same, but as<br/>
&gt; &gt;I get more protective songs they will take some precedence.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Note one VERY important thing:  We are NOT defined by our <br/>
&gt; songs the way<br/>
&gt; &gt;spellcasters are defined by their spells.  We are also middlin-fair<br/>
&gt; &gt;warriors (You watch a wiz try to go toe to toe with a fast <br/>
&gt; melee mob and<br/>
&gt; &gt;see who&#39;s still standing).  We are also the SINGLE MOST <br/>
&gt; VERSATILE CLASS IN<br/>
&gt; &gt;THE GAME.  Read that sentence again.  There is NOTHING we <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t do:  pick<br/>
&gt; &gt;locks, disarm traps, put monsters to sleep, heal our party, <br/>
&gt; hide our party,<br/>
&gt; &gt;take our party underwater....  Bards in EQ are the <br/>
&gt; single-most powerful<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bard class I&#39;ve ever played (and this is from someone who&#39;s <br/>
&gt; played Bard in<br/>
&gt; &gt;nearly every conceivable RPG).<br/>
&gt; &gt;As has been stated before, we enhance a party.  If you want <br/>
&gt; to convert a<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bard to a mathematical formula, where fighters = 1, and <br/>
&gt; spellchuckers = 1,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and Clerics = 1, Bards = x2 multiplier.  We make everyone better.<br/>
