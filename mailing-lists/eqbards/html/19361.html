&gt;[Quote from original post: Tonight, as my group and I were on our way to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dalnir, we decided to take a short cut through Cabilis. So we invised<br/>
ourselves and strolled past the guards. I was killed lickity-split, while my<br/>
pals weren&#39;t. Wondering why the guards saw through my invis and not the<br/>
others, we tried a few experiments to find out. Well we found the answer.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Seems if you invis or camo yourself, then someone else tries to overwrite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your invis with one of their own, you are now visible, though the icon<br/>
remains.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;This brings up all sorts of issues (intentional PKing?). I&#39;d like to know<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if Verant is aware of this bug or not?]<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a bug that we are aware of. If anyone casts a buff of any kind on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you while you are invis, you are then visible to NPCs even though the icon<br/>
remains.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you for bringing it up though, I&#39;ll see if I can find out where it is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on the to-do list.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;End clip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the meantime, don&#39;t try grouping with 7 of your fiends - you dirty<br/>
 </span></blockquote>rotten no good exploiters!!!  We have guides posted everywhere who will ban<br/>
you without recourse!  They have been given strict instructions to stop<br/>
helping people who die zoning - sorry but some of you are just gonna fall<br/>
thru the cracks - literally - while we bring you vicious exploiters to<br/>
justice! And if I remember, and happen to see someone at the water cooler,<br/>
I&#39;ll ask him to ask around and see if anyone feels like fixing your<br/>
invisibility bug.<br/>
