<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835023363">So far, the equivalent quested items are more &quot;theoretical&quot; than anything<br/>

My guild has farmed Plane of Gimps to the point where they are bored - and<br/>
we got a pile of loots.  Even folks who didn&#39;t want the factions came in to<br/>
loot after everyone else who fought and took faction hits got loots. We<br/>
tried to kill giants and get the corroded stuff but it never dropped (we got<br/>
one set of boots made iirc.) Look on the spoiler sites and you see that no<br/>
quested armor items are getting reported - it&#39;s far easier to kill stuff in<br/>
PoG.<br/>

It is my understanding that every item that drops in the PoG is also<br/>
questable there (I could be wrong).  I am personally a follower of<br/>
Quellious, so I dont have any specific restrictions (other than roleplaying<br/>
ones) about hunting in the PoG. <br/>
