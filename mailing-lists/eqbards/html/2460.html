<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just before I gave up my L 13 bard on Veeshan (If you must know, I<br/>
was getting bored, my friends were all playing 8 hour days and I<br/>
was getting left behind, and L 13 bards don&#39;t seem to be a hot<br/>
commodity item on Veeshan around Freeport.  But I stay on this list<br/>
because it is great, with much discussion that is relevant to classes<br/>
other than the bard), I ventured into the area of making food.<br/>
<br/>
I bought all the cookbooks and started making goo with a skill of<br/>
1.  Would you believe that I had a 90% success rate?!  I guess the<br/>
effect of books on skill really adds up when you are carrying 13 of<br/>
them.  Some patch after that they must have changed it, because<br/>
now I have success closer to 50% with a skill about 12.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I personally think that it lasts longer than the store bought<br/>
stuff.  For one, logic (Verant, logic?!  haha) dictates that it<br/>
must have some use, and the only benefits are the low weight (0.1<br/>
per food item), so longer lasting could be another.<br/>
And I &#39;timed&#39; it while hunting, comparing food consumption with<br/>
water consumption.  I drank water more than twice as fast as I<br/>
ate edible goo.  Of course, this was in NRo, a desert, so you drink<br/>
faster anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Any others?<br/>
