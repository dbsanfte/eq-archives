&gt; &gt; only real gripe about this is that it&#39;s possible for a mob to<br/>
&gt; &gt; immediately break out of an effect.  That doesn&#39;t make sense<br/>
&gt; &gt; to me because that&#39;s what the initial resist check is for.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; If it didn&#39;t resist, then it should suffer the effect for at<br/>
&gt; &gt; least one tick, not 0.1 seconds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t seem fair to me either, but it&#39;s the same problem with roots.<br/>
&gt; Wizards whine about how bad their roots are, well, with my druid&#39;s roots<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a check for root resist, a check for dmg resist (meaning about 70%<br/>
&gt; resist rate on blues), THEN half the time it doesn&#39;t &#39;stick&#39;, meaning the<br/>
&gt; effect seems to wearoff immediately and the mob never stops moving.<br/>

initial resist check if they immediately get another.<br/>
<br/>
I wish *we* got a resist check to break out of stun.  I got<br/>
stunned five times in a row this morning and died.<br/>
