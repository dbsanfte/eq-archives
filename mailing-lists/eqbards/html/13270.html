<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264280374">A quick defense of mages (who I often think are the worst group players<br/>
in the game).  A mage who wants to learn group tactics (and they can be<br/>
real benefits in a group if played well) has a very hard time.  Problem<br/>
1: Having the ability to solo through 20 easily and beyond there still<br/>
fairly well is a dangerous temptation.  Especially when you consider how<br/>
frustrating pickup groups can be.  (this is not a real excuse though)<br/>
<br/>
Problem 2:  Since there is so much talk about how much mages suck in<br/>
groups (including how pets suck up xp, if you think the jig requests are<br/>
bad see how many people insist that your pet is hurting their xp), no<br/>
one wants to group with them.  My second char was a mage and I almost<br/>
NEVER could find a group.  The prejudice against mages is huge.  Which<br/>
is a shame because I&#39;m pretty convinced they can outdamage a wizard in a<br/>
good group (though no evac hurts). <br/>
<br/>
On the same thread, I was with the same two (enchanter and shaman) again<br/>
last night.  Most of the night, wisely we decided a buffed up Elfson<br/>
(Thats me, 15 bard) was better than a crap shoot tank.  They also<br/>
encuraged me to experiment with songs since we were a pretty unstandard<br/>
group.  It actually seemed that just continous Discord was our best<br/>
bet.  (Bellow was almost always resissted by DW crocs).  In any case it<br/>
was fun to be tank for a night, I had more than a full column of buffs. <br/>
(Most of the night we bough resolution for me from friendly clerics,<br/>
usually traded a set of shaman buffs for cleric buffs).  I think I had<br/>
115 str and 550 hp which is pretty cool for a lvl 15 bard...  Only one<br/>
death all night too, and that was when the enchantress was talking to<br/>
her mom and missed all my &quot;SG near&quot;, &quot;SG Approaching!&quot; &quot;SG!&quot; &quot;SG!&quot; &quot;SG!&quot;<br/>
messages.<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
