<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836169604">I have seen a corpse summoned from the bottom of the Highhold Pass straight<br/>
up - some 500+ feet to the ledge where they fell off.  I&#39;d guess that they<br/>
are using the same &quot;stuff&quot; for ranging corpses as for ranging effects.  (But<br/>
then how come there are 3 different user interface stlyes to navaigate just<br/>
to get into the game? Sometimes exit button is on left, sometimes its on<br/>
right, sometimes all the buttons are the same size, sometimes they are<br/>
different sizes.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have pulled _every_ single bird from the top floor main tree house<br/>
with CoD.  Hello! 3 Avo&#39;s, 2 Har&#39;s and a Rook!  Also, from the top floor I<br/>
have attacked birds that are in the spawn spots on the ground (and they<br/>
attack me back - that&#39;s how I know!)<br/>
<br/>
So, if its not infinite, its still pretty dog-gone large!<br/>

		I think the infinite sphere concept is more likely what is<br/>
happening.  I was<br/>

		I wonder if our AE songs like DDD and CoD actually have a<br/>
infinite<br/>
		cylindrical AE instead of a sphere around the singer?  For<br/>
example, the</div>
