<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793837587">heh, i&#39;d be willing to bet they are using the built in c code random number generator.<br/>
the problem is you are just using your perceptions of what happens.  and what sticks<br/>
out is going to be the anomaly.  if you sat down for an hour and kept clicking the song<br/>
icon and tracked how many fails and when they occurred in relation to the others, i would<br/>
think that you would find that it is random.<br/>
<br/>
i mean take a roulette wheel.  it&#39;s almost a 50/50 chance for red or black to come up.  strings<br/>
of 10+ red or 10+ black are hardly uncommon.</div>
