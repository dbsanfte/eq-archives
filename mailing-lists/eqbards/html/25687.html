<div id="ygrps-yiv-365787490">Anyone else trying to train brass right now?  Anyone else in hell, not <br/>
getting skill points, even after hours of singing?<br/>
<br/>
Did brass get nerfed or something so that it only increases when in <br/>
battle?  (not what I heard from bard 2 weeks ago, it was working in arena <br/>
to train brass then just fine)...<br/>

Desperately seeking...<br/>
