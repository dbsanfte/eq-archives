<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040886829">If I want to subscribe to a Gore-bashing mailing list I will.  I can think<br/>
of a hundred retorts - but it&#39;s not appropriate here...<br/>
<br/>
As far as the ballots - a poorly defined user-interface is a poorly designed<br/>
user interface.  The intelligence or educational level of the user isn&#39;t<br/>
going to compensate for that.  We have the same type in here in Cook<br/>
County - as the Republicans point out - BUT for everything except judicial<br/>
retention - you never go left-right-left-right - all the candidates for an<br/>
office are on one side of the ballot - and the opposite side is blank.<br/>
<br/>
I AM college educated - and voted many times - and when I got to the<br/>
judicial part (which has options on both side) - it IS very confusing - and<br/>
I realized I screwed it up.  But I figured &quot;It&#39;s just judges - most people<br/>
don&#39;t vote on those - who cares&quot;.  And it didn&#39;t matter - to remove a judge<br/>
it requires 60 percent of the voters to vote no - and not a single has lost<br/>
their job in many many years (great system there)...<br/>
<br/>
That ballot in Palm Beach Florida was very poorly designed.  I guess that<br/>
guy can always get a job working for Verant...<br/>

Hehe, the real irony here is the same type of ballot<br/>
card is used in Al Gore&#39;s home county.  Course, this<br/>
is the same guy who&#39;s surrounded by several buddhist<br/>
idols, eastern temple arcitecture, and is surrounded<br/>
by men dressed in traditional buddhists clothing but<br/>
doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s in a buddhist temple.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I really hate my country.<br/>
