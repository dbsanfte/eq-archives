<div id="ygrps-yiv-863328875"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The key to outrunning spellcasters is to equip<br/>
&gt; your drum. With your drum they should be able<br/>
&gt; to tag you with one spell. Without it they can<br/>
&gt; get off two or three.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The problem for me is being stunned. I&#39;ll mash my NumLock key to start<br/>
running, switch to my hotkey bank that holds my meelee and inv slots and<br/>
start swapping, all the sudden I&#39;m not running anymore and/or my Selo&#39;s has<br/>
been ended. Now I have either stand still and finish swapping weapon &<br/>
shield for an instrument or I have to mash the NumLock again, switch back to<br/>
my songs hotkey bank, hit Selo&#39;s (several times lately before it works),<br/>
switch back to my slots bank, finish swapping items and hope I&#39;m still alive<br/>
in the time that it took to do the above. If I&#39;m having an especially bad<br/>
day, I simply can&#39;t keep Selo&#39;s going and myself moving because I&#39;m being<br/>
nailed by spells that stun me and turn off my songs. Those are usually the<br/>
days that I can&#39;t get very far before being stunned, so another lovely mob<br/>
gets close enough to me that as soon as I&#39;m unstunned, they bash me and I&#39;m<br/>
stunned again.<br/>
