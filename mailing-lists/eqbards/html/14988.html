<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513980644">Heh, I was thinking the same thing.  Also has anyone noticed that two<br/>
boats seem to often be almost together.  As in boat 1 arrives in<br/>
freeport, departs, then less than 10 min later boat 2 arrives, departs,<br/>
leaving about 30 min before boat 1 comes back again?<br/>

&gt; Only Verant would think boats shouldn&#39;t run on a set schedule!  Too<br/>
&gt; convenient?  I wish there was some way I could set the RL time schedule of<br/>
&gt; whoever dreamed this up at Verant.<br/>

&gt;         Chef:   &quot;Oh, you know it would be too convenient if you knew exactly<br/>
&gt; when             your dinner would arrive so we made it random.  You missed<br/>
&gt; it by            3 minutes, come back tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
