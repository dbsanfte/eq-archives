<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-255164201">You are correct that the item I referred to is the Ring of the Dead. However, while it is wearable (and attainable) only by dark elf shadowknights and necromancers, it is usable by all classes, all races. You can use it on yourself or others. <br/>
<br/>
My point was never that is was an easily attainable item. My point is that it is in the game. It is possible. Just as Gate potions are now in the game, even if they are prohibitively expensive to anyone but the highest level characters. And as long as Verant makes that sort of functionality possible, those who do not already have it will not be getting it as a class ability.<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting bound at 3am in Erudin, that largely depends on the server you play on and your friends. Anyone with high level druid or wizard acquaintances would have no trouble at all. That nothwithstanding, people on the larger, more populated servers, like Fennin Ro or Xegony, will have less problems than someone on Tallon or Vallon Zek.<br/>
<br/>
We as bards have a much easier time being bound in evil cities. After we die, we can invis past the guards, we can use our sneak ability (rogues have it even easier because they can sneak and hide at the same time) or with Selo&#39;s we can attempt to even just run right past them to the nearest zone (you might get whacked a time or two as you go speeding past though). <br/>
<br/>
I agree with the other comments regarding melee classes not wanting to bind, but just being able to be bound outside of city zones. I have no problem with this line of thinking. Actually, I think this change would be much more likely to happen than to restrict those who already can bind.<br/>

casts bind, and it is Necromancer and Shadowknight only.<br/>
