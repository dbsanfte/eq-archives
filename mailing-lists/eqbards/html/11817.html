 </span></blockquote>No, the level system is limited, but not crippling.  What&#39;s<br/>
crippling is Verant having nerfed anything resembling a trade<br/>
skill to the point where they&#39;re pointless, unprofitable, or<br/>
ineffective.  That means the *only* way to achieve anything in<br/>
this game is via leveling.  UO is way ahead of EQ on this<br/>
point (which in part is why UO has such different problems<br/>
than EQ, or EQ doesn&#39;t have some of the problems UO has if you<br/>
want to think of it that way).<br/>
