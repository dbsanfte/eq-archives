But I don&#39;t think that he has intentions of selling it. (If he does, I&#39;ll<br/>
kill him.) He said that he would actually use. (Why is beyond me, highest<br/>
I&#39;ve played a rogue to is level 5)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna try a different tactic tonight. I&#39;ll calmly explain that if I had<br/>
the EBW it would not leave my hand until I was wielding planar loot. If he<br/>
can&#39;t say the same thing, but still insists on rolling then I may have to<br/>
kill him.<br/>

I was wondering why the rogue would think he needed the EBW as well.  Since<br/>
its No drop he can&#39;t sell it.  My rogue used 1 HS weapons for completeness,<br/>
but only until he got Backstab.  Since then I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even touched<br/>
the FS Scimitar in the bank.  Very odd.  Are the fangs not No Drop as well?<br/>
