<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537687327">Wow, I couldn&#39;t agree more!  It has always been my pet peeve to hear people<br/>
say those things... I have never played D&D but I hear it was wonderful<br/>
because you could have the &quot;fighter/mage&quot; which I think is what a lot of<br/>
people look for.. something that is powerful in every aspect.  Despite<br/>
general opinion, I really believe that the best part about EQ is class<br/>
balance, and I think Verant does a pretty good job.  Sure there are<br/>
shortcomings and the system isn&#39;t perfect but I think it works well.<br/>
People, by nature, just generally want it ALL :)  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I personally think our power is balanced with the other classes as the<br/>
&gt; game currently exists and any haste stacking would overpower the bard<br/>
&gt; class.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the flaws that I see in a lot of arguments for more <br/>
&gt; powers is &#39;&#39;in literature<br/>
&gt; bards have...blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or &#39;&#39;in history, bards <br/>
&gt; were....blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or my<br/>
&gt; favorite, &#39;&#39;in my vision bards should be able to do....blah <br/>
&gt; blah blah, the designer<br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;s vision is obviously wrong&#39;&#39;.  While everquest can be <br/>
&gt; said to be loosely based <br/>
&gt; on various fantasy sources, it is a separate entity and any <br/>
&gt; direct comparisons to<br/>
&gt; external sources really aren&#39;t necessarily a compelling <br/>
&gt; argument for or against anything.<br/>
