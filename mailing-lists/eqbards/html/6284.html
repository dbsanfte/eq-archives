the winner.  Because your initial charmee is running, he won&#39;t<br/>
attack you.  This doesn&#39;t work on all mobs because some of<br/>
them fight until death (which means switching charmees results<br/>
in the initial charmee attacking you until it dies).  And<br/>
sometimes you end up in those annoying situations where both<br/>
mobs damage each other simultaneous to where they both start<br/>
to run.  But in general, as long as the winner is charmed when<br/>
the loser dies, you will get credit for the kill.<br/>
<br/>
Whipping out Chain/Screech in these situations can work too.<br/>
