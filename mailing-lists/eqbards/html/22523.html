<div id="ygrps-yiv-220509375">I didnt do any timings, but oh my was I fast with this song!  I twisted, lvl<br/>
45 Jonathons, the lvl 51 Largos and lvl 47 Nivs.  <br/>
<br/>
From a purely subjective standpoint it felt like I was attacking twice as<br/>
fast.  My only thought now is that I need to get a FBSS, hangman&#39;s noose or<br/>
something, as I finally have a NEED for a haste item!  <br/>
<br/>
I tested on a blue petrafier cockatrice wielding a Martune rapier(primary)<br/>
and a SSOY and kicked some bardic ass!  I ended the fight a little under two<br/>
bubbles damaged.  Without this new song, i would have gotten rode hard and<br/>
sent home wet!<br/>
