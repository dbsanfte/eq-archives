<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872170150">Hehe, do enough dragons and eventually everyone gets everything they want.<br/>
We use a point system similar to Shada&#39;s, and I only recently obtained my<br/>
belt.  I think there&#39;s only one or two other people that are waiting for a<br/>
belt still.  A lot of people chose to hold out for the CoF/TBB combo too, so<br/>
there&#39;s actually relatively few people who wanted the belt.<br/>
I&#39;ve also got the Selo&#39;s Drum and the Horn of War (which I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve<br/>
even used) since we only have two bards in our guild, and the other one<br/>
doesn&#39;t show up nearly as much.  We&#39;ve sorta reached a point now, where the<br/>
only dragon items people still need/want are the haste items.  I&#39;ve also got<br/>
an orb of tishan (awesome bard item btw) and a gold plated koshigitana<br/>
(pretty crappy, very low proc rate and next to no summoned mobs to use it<br/>
against)<br/>
<br/>
I know my gloves clash horribly, but I haven&#39;t been able to obtain imbrued<br/>
ones yet.  None have even dropped on our server to date.  Was sorta thinking<br/>
of going for the gauntlets of fiery might anyway.  They&#39;re not in very high<br/>
demand since most classes have better planar gloves, and our monks all<br/>
already have them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got the tranix crown, but tend to only wear it for situational uses<br/>
(i.e. I need the extra MR or CHA)<br/>
<br/>
My base DEX is 100 if that helps at all.  I was actually at 150 before I<br/>
swapped out my GBP choker for the mithril torque.  Wasn&#39;t even aiming for<br/>
dex really, it just sorta worked out that way.<br/>
<br/>
Hooded black cloak, crested spaulders and runed lava pendant are currently<br/>
on my want list.  Was considering diamondines, but they&#39;re hella hard to<br/>
come by it seems (too lazy to camp them myself) and if I did get any, I&#39;d<br/>
probably give them to my monk first.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been very fortunate in my equipment, in that 90% of the time I&#39;m the<br/>
only bard around.  I&#39;ve never really had to worry about loot squabbles, I<br/>
tend to get items mainly because nobody else is there to claim them.<br/>

How on earth did they let a bard have a runed bolster belt? =)<br/>
Seriously, being the weakest of the melee classes what sort of dragon<br/>
loot system is used that allowed you to be have such an item. Also does<br/>
it make you ineligible for Selo&#39;s drum and Horn of War?<br/>
A few improvements in your equipment I might add if you dont mind which<br/>
you&#39;re probably already aware of.<br/>
Wear Imbrued gloves (assuming you have them), the lambent ones are just<br/>
awful looking. If you&#39;re ever able to get a Tranix crown, wear that over<br/>
Imbrued (assuming you dont have one). Imbrued helm also looks awful =).<br/>
Crested spaulders -better ac and hp, dex useless since your weapons dont<br/>
proc. Hooded black cloak if you&#39;re lucky enough to obtain one - the 45<br/>
hp outweighs the extra 2 ac on cloak of shadows in my opinion.<br/>
Diamondine earrings - 122 charisma is plenty so you can afford to lose<br/>
the opallines, especially if you choose Tranix over Imbrued.<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to figure out why your dex is so high. Imbrued BP (13),<br/>
bracer (3), Gloves (5), Belt (10), Pauldrons (7 or 9?), Cloak (5). Also<br/>
how much hp does the bolster belt give you? I&#39;m assuming roughly 30 hp.<br/>
Please let me know.<br/>
