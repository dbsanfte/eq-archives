<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030453878">These undead&#39;s in Kith have strong resists to MR.  I use elemental with my<br/>
MM drum for as high MR as possible for our party - at least for the few<br/>
opening rounds - then switch to weps if the party needs me to melee. I was<br/>
in a group and someone was dispelling them and that really seemed to help.<br/>
I have been using my FulFil&#39;s Curtailing chant to open and get that -10 mr<br/>
on them and then hit them with chains or a bellow if someone else has them<br/>
snared. And then if snared good and they are at or near half health -<br/>
screetch.  Hehe fun to make them flee and it stops their attacks on you.  <br/>

<br/>
		In my camping of the Icy Greaves last week, and last night&#39;s<br/>
grouping in Kith, taking out high-level undead (the lowest thing con&#39;d gold<br/>
to me at 28) I have noticed that although DDD may be more powerful, CoD will<br/>
be resisited by higher level creatures MUCH less often.  About the only<br/>
things that resisted it were red cons that were upper 30&#39;s-ish to maybe 40.<br/>
Don&#39;t take my word for it, try it yourself and see ;o)<br/>
