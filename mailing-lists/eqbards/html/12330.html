Mithril trades for stuff like FBSS, manastone etc. Noooooooo, can&#39;t believe<br/>
you lost out on that chance.<br/>
All the level 50 bards I know wear Mithril if they don&#39;t have Imbrued.<br/>
<br/>
Damn, wish I had offers like that.  =(<br/>

Last night a high level wizard starting offering me a ton of mithril stuff<br/>
in trade for my lambent.  Having never seen a piece of mithril before in my<br/>
life, I haven&#39;t the slightest whether or not this is a good trade or not.<br/>
Anyone got any advice on the break down between mithril and lambent?  He<br/>
was<br/>
offering multiple mithril pieces per one lambent piece.<br/>
