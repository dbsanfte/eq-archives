<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011467697">Someone one the Bard Board posted their experience with taking on the Hermit<br/>
too.  They were doing exactly what you&#39;re proposing, sitting and blasting an<br/>
AOE song that the Hermit would spawn into.  The were repremanded by a GM<br/>
(after the GM killed the Hermit) and told that it was an exploit and not to<br/>
repeat the behavior.  Personally I don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s an exploit, but I&#39;m<br/>
just informing you that that&#39;s what happened to that one guy on that one<br/>
server with that one GM.  Your mileage may vary.<br/>

&gt; Here is what I found - we were camping Herman the Hermit for the Winds of<br/>
&gt; Karana quest.  He was a dangerous blue to me - so there was no way I could<br/>
&gt; solo him and in fact he did kill me even when I had help. He&#39;s a ranger or<br/>
&gt; druid - I don&#39;t know those classes well enough to say exactly but he would<br/>
&gt; spawn and then buff himself with at least 3 buffs in a row - the 3rd one<br/>
&gt; being shield of thorns - ouch!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So when my blonde-ness wore off, I thought hmmm, what if I don&#39;t wait for<br/>
&gt; him to get all nice and thorny before schwacking him?  So, we&#39;d heal up then<br/>
&gt; while my party - 2 rangers were medding I went over by his bedroom window to<br/>
&gt; practice my brass skills - ya, ya I was just practicing - that&#39;s it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly begins to practice her brass...<br/>
&gt; a hermit begins to cast a spell...(some kinda self-buff)<br/>
&gt; a hermit begins to cast a spell...(another self-buff)<br/>
&gt; a hermit winces...(hehe here is where he winces instead of casting thorns)<br/>
&gt; a hermit begins to cast a spell...(now he&#39;s mad but has forgotten to do the<br/>
&gt; rest of his buffs)<br/>
&gt; Sylly is struck by a bolt of fire...(ok, doky time to come out and play<br/>
&gt; herman!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - while this was not exactly interrupting his casting - in that I would<br/>
&gt; see only occasional interrupt messages by him - it did significantly affect<br/>
&gt; how he would fight us.  As soon as he spawned he gets his first spell off<br/>
&gt; immediately then when he got attacked by my Denon&#39;s - he stopped his buff<br/>
&gt; routine and switched to his attack mode.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the tip is - don&#39;t wait for him to spawn (which you know because you see<br/>
&gt; his buff casting) before you attack him - lay down a nice AE for him to<br/>
&gt; spawn into.  Unless you like stabbing yourself with thorns &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; p.s.  Harmonic Distortion gave a concert in BlackBurrow Paw Sunday<br/>
&gt; afternoon.  It proved to be very popular because _every_single_gnoll_ in the<br/>
&gt; whole Burrow (and some of the married ones too!) came up to the top floor<br/>
&gt; and gathered around Harmonic to hear his concert.  When he was done, a<br/>
&gt; certain druid named Estella who was also enjoying the concert, applauded the<br/>
&gt; performance with what sounded like the shock of an earthquake! The young<br/>
&gt; adventurers in the Burrow were quite happy to loot the 30 or so gnolls who<br/>
&gt; died in that blast &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Lullaby and interupting casting.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my take on the whole issue.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure of this but this is just a couple of<br/>
&gt; observations I have made using lullaby extensively.<br/>
&gt; (Been using it a lot since I got it at level 15)<br/>
&gt; Every song pulses at every tick (6 seconds) as far as<br/>
&gt; I can tell. And lullaby/nod is no exception. I think<br/>
&gt; every time nod pulses the mob has to make a savings<br/>
&gt; check to see if it resists or not. Assume we have a<br/>
&gt; spell caster that resisted it, and then it begins<br/>
&gt; casting. If the casting does not take more than 6<br/>
&gt; seconds, there is no chance that nod will be able to<br/>
&gt; interupt it. Since NPC casters do not suffer the same<br/>
&gt; casting time limitations as PC casters do, most are<br/>
&gt; able to get a spell off before the next pulse of nod<br/>
&gt; and hence can cast without being interupted. However,<br/>
&gt; sometimes when the mob resist nod, it attacks first and<br/>
&gt; then cast. When this happens, the attack and the casting<br/>
&gt; might not be complete within 6 seconds so when nod pulses<br/>
&gt; again and the mob fails the savings, then it is nodded<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s casting is interupted. This is what I seem to<br/>
&gt; observe a lot. YMMV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
