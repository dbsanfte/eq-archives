&gt; I have a dilemma :)  Last night I purchased (for 200 plat) an Obsidian Shard<br/>
&gt; (6 Dam/25 delay, Obsidian Shatter effect).  I had thought I had read the the<br/>
&gt; OS effect did 75 damage, but I only proc&#39;d once last night for 30. The<br/>
&gt; effect is very cool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now the dilemma.  A rogue offered me a Polished Granite Tomahawk and a<br/>
&gt; Dragoon Dirk for the Shard.  Now personally I am leaning toward keeping the<br/>
&gt; Shard, but I know I could barter the PGT into either a good bit of plat<br/>
&gt; (saving for steel plate) or a nice item or two.  Any and all advise is<br/>
&gt; welcome....<br/>

Don&#39;t know if this is too late or not.  In terms of weapons, the shard and the<br/>
tomahawk are roughly equal.  The shard is a better weapon, barely, but the<br/>
tomahawk&#39;s effect is slightly better I think.   The dirk is a great weapon, but<br/>
very common.  Monetarily, if you made that trade, you would come out ahead.  But<br/>
speaking monetarily, I also think you could sell the shard for more than 200<br/>
plat as well.  Go with your heart. :)<br/>
