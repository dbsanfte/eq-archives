<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Clan Battlehammer <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-564721040">Well the guildleader and the other members whom I respected for their <br/>
mature and fun play have all left due to internal strife that all came <br/>
about from a simple disagreement that seemed to snowball and caused an <br/>
implosion.<br/>
<br/>
My first guild, Guardians of the Divine Light, fell apart since the core <br/>
members changed servers. I pretty much only see Musiker around from that <br/>
original gang. I had travelled with members from Clan Battlehammer from the <br/>
beginning as well (I always saw them in Crushbone as a level 10 bard). <br/>
Since a close friend was in the Clan, he invited me. It actually was the <br/>
2nd incarnation of the Clan since their original guildleader left and a <br/>
whole new group of people were forming the core of the guild.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad to see this happen to the oldest and the very first guild on <br/>
Bertoxxulous.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda curious how other guilds are able to keep going strong? My first <br/>
guild wanted to remain small, passed up opportunities to absorb another <br/>
guild and ended up dying due to attrition of a sort. CBH is falling apart <br/>
(though I&#39;m sure someone will keep it going) due to in-fighting (I think <br/>
the arguments came about due to twinks). The groups I&#39;ve been with want a <br/>
small &quot;family&quot; feeling group, but at the same time, want to be able to go <br/>
on Dragon/Planes raids. I myself probably won&#39;t ever go on a big raid due <br/>
to time constraints so I don&#39;t really worry about such things. I just like <br/>
to have a group of people who I can chat with and maybe partner up with <br/>
occasionally if we&#39;re in the same area.<br/>
