<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-288120614">Can you guys actually run other programs while running <br/>
EQ???  I can&#39;t alt-tab to anything else without totally <br/>
screwing EQ and having to ctl-alt-del it to get it to <br/>
close down.  It really messes with my graphics.  Before I <br/>
start up EQ I close everything else down ... including my <br/>
anti-virus software (hate having a scan during a melee <br/>
... it&#39;s like fighting thru pudding!).<br/>
<br/>
Based on this thread, I&#39;m now wondering if it&#39;s just <br/>
because my poor &#39;puter is just powerful enough to run EQ. <br/>
If that&#39;s the case, then woohoo! cuz I&#39;m waiting for my <br/>
new puter to be built.  How do you guys run the voice <br/>
communication software while running EQ?  I&#39;m curious.<br/>

&gt;Before finishing reading this pop over to GameSpot.com and <br/>
&gt;do a FULL TEXT (not title) search on Battlecom and you will <br/>
&gt;get a CGW article from the July issue (the one with the big<br/>
&gt;QUAKE III in yellow on the cover) discussing the merits of both<br/>
&gt;Roger Wilco and BattleCom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Ah ! you read it. Seems Roger Wilco has a memory bled that causes<br/>
&gt;you to have to log off and restart it after a half hour because the<br/>
&gt;communication degrads. BattleCom on the other hand was solid enough<br/>
&gt;that Microsoft just brought them out to be able to make that internet<br/>
&gt;audio actually PART of Windows 2000 for next summers release.<br/>
&gt;  Give me BattleCOM any time. Relogging breaks up parties :)<br/>
