&gt; I have had this happend to me twice this week now.  I charm something that <br/>
&gt; had been attacking a Shamen&#39;s pet (one was a party members pet, other a <br/>
&gt; non-party member). And both times the shamen pet decided I looked tasty and <br/>
&gt; started nipping at me, bad dog! :)  So becareful using charm are shamen&#39;s <br/>
&gt; pets, unless you like being their chew toy.<br/>

lizard an enchanter had charmed.  The enchanter wouldn&#39;t<br/>
believe me when I kept saying &quot;Your pet is attacking me,<br/>
please tell it to back off&quot; throughout the fight (we were<br/>
fighting 4 lizards at once) until the pet broke the charm.  <br/>
<br/>
After the mauling I took in that episode with little sympathy<br/>
from the others, when it happened a couple weeks later with<br/>
the necro pet, I let it keep hitting me until the fight was<br/>
over.  Then after a sufficient pause to make sure everyone saw<br/>
it was attacking me, I asked &quot;Why is your pet attacking me?&quot;  <br/>
No denying that one.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think there is something funny going on with the hate list<br/>
targeting, and the inability to order a pet to attack a player<br/>
or its pet.<br/>
