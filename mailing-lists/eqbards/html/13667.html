He&#39;d made a joke about people commenting to him &quot;Wow!  A<br/>
wizard that stuns instead of nukes!&quot; but I&#39;d forgotten about<br/>
it.  Anyway, he was in a melee-heavy group whose healers were<br/>
a ranger and a bard.  They pulled a mob, he immediately<br/>
stunned it.  Melee guys beat on it.  Stun wears out, mob is<br/>
aggroed on the melee guys by now so they take a bit of damage,<br/>
he stuns it again.  Repeat until mob is dead.  Never aggroed<br/>
the mobs onto himself, drastically cut down on the damage the<br/>
group was taking.  The only time he nuked was when they had<br/>
multiple mobs.  I was impressed.  The class is not as<br/>
one-dimensional as I&#39;d originally thought.<br/>
