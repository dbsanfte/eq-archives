<b>Subject:</b> RE: Great post on item balancing (Long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718788504">Brian&#39;s post is interesting, but I&#39;m not sure it is all that accurate.<br/>
Perhaps this is accurately what Verant wants to be true, but it is not what<br/>
is true.  Monks out damage warriors only until the warrior gains some good<br/>
weapons around 15th level or so.  After that the warrior often out damages<br/>
the monk, but the monk takes less damage.  The reason for this?  The monk<br/>
having no offensive items to spend money on is free to spend all his funds<br/>
to acquire better defensive items.  The two do seem to balance out with the<br/>
warrior doing more damage but the monk taking less.  Despite not being able<br/>
to wear heavy armor our group monk who is 2 levels lower than me has nearly<br/>
the same ac I do, and I have only one piece of armor with an AC below banded<br/>
and several at plate or higher.  He takes way less damage than I do and<br/>
until he is 35th level will probably never die again except in very rare<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest laugh was at Brian&#39;s mention of Bard only items.  That&#39;s a good<br/>
one.  Excepting the quest armor, there are what, two bard only items that<br/>
you can get without taking on a dragon or going to the planes?  A Shawl of<br/>
the Wind Spirit and Mistmoore Battle Drums, that&#39;s it as far as I know.  A<br/>
piece of armor equal to cloth and a drum on a 35+ mob.  To even mention bard<br/>
only items was in my opinion a slap in the face.  Considering one is useless<br/>
after 3rd level and the other sells for 500pp+ that&#39;s a joke.  What other<br/>
class has so little equipment dedicated to it?  There must be one but I<br/>
don&#39;t know what it would be.  Are there even any other items on mobs below<br/>
30th that are bard plus a few others?  Shimmering Orb, great for looks but<br/>
with dual wield is it useful?  Anyone know of anything else?<br/>
<br/>
My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items, why<br/>
is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th level?<br/>
There really isn&#39;t anything much better than my dragoon dirk and screaming<br/>
mace available for bards at my level.  The only 1HS weapons available are a<br/>
Polished Granite Tomahawk and a Barbed Leather Whip.  They don&#39;t even begin<br/>
to compare to our Shadowknight&#39;s Dark Reaver.  The primary weapons carried<br/>
by every member of our group is better than either the PGT or the BLW.  Why?<br/>
That&#39;s a good question.  Since we don&#39;t have anybody near my level who is a<br/>
melee class (or hybrid other than the SK) its really puzzling.  Our mages<br/>
carry Glowing Wooden Crooks or better, at 150pp not hard to see why.  The<br/>
shadowknight has a dark Reaver and I&#39;m using the same primary as the 7th<br/>
level ranger, a dragoon dirk.  At 25pp who would blame him?  A good 1HS<br/>
weapon on the other hand cost 400pp+.<br/>
Why does this inequity exist?  Because in truth their are far more good<br/>
piercing weapons per piercing user than 1HS per 1HS user.  All the good 1HS<br/>
weapons at the mid-levels are either warrior or paladin or ranger only.  I<br/>
could currently get thru quests at least 6 weapons I cannot use.  The quests<br/>
are easily doable for a group of my level or close (21st).  I can get no<br/>
decent weapons via quest that I can use except the Screaming Mace that I did<br/>
9 levels ago.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me if anyone can refute this and offer me a solution to where I<br/>
might find a better weapon obtainable I&#39;d be glad to hear it.  I get really<br/>
tired of having my own guild members laugh, &quot;you still using that little<br/>
sticker?&quot;  I suppose I could buy a PGT, but at the 250pp they go for on E&#39;ci<br/>
it hardly seems justifiable.  Any suggestions out there?  I currently own 4<br/>
magical piercing weapons (don&#39;t ask), and 2 magical 1HB, but only a combine<br/>
Scimitar for 1HS.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  This guy is like a god.  When I read his stuff, I get more<br/>
  insight, more information, and more chuckles than anything<br/>
  else Verant releases.  I especially enjoyed reading his story<br/>
  about the GM event he ran a long time ago.  I wish there were <br/>
  more of him running around at Verant.  The game would<br/>
  probably be a lot more interesting.<br/>
