<div id="ygrps-yiv-914671044">Dual wield checks whenever your &#39;off&#39; hand is ready to swing.  Regardless of<br/>
how fast your primary swings.<br/>
<br/>
So at lower levels you will want your fastest weapons in off-hand to cause<br/>
it to do a DW check more often, thus increasing the skill faster.  At higher<br/>
levels, however, the skill doesn&#39;t have as far to go and you have a &#39;minimum<br/>
dmg cap&#39; on your primary hand so you put your fastest weapon in your primary<br/>
hand to boost your average dmg up with that minimum dmg factor.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers have known this for a looooong time since the difference is so much<br/>
more dramatic with double attack.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ack, halt right there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Dual wielding is completely independant.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The delay of your primary hand has nothing to do with the delay of your<br/>
off<br/>
&gt; &gt;hand. That being said, if you want to dual wield a lot, put a very fast<br/>
&gt; &gt;weapon into your off hand.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whoops, when last I heard the word on how these things worked (some time<br/>
&gt; ago) you did a check for Dual Weild at the end of every primary attack. A<br/>
&gt; faster weapon in your primary hand meant more checks, likely meaning more<br/>
&gt; dual weilding. No?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;At lower levels, with no minimum damage, the conventional theory is to<br/>
put<br/>
&gt; &gt;the faster weapon in the off hand so that you will dual weild more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yow, that&#39;s what I get for being gone for so long. Thanks,<br/>
