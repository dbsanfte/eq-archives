* Tuk, Shin, etc. are all types of frogloks, not separate races.  You get <br/>
combinations like a froglok shin warrior, froglok tuk knight, froglok tuk <br/>
shaman, etc.  I&#39;m told that their toughness runs more or less in <br/>
alphabetical order.<br/>
<br/>
* Lull is used not only for the pre-combat spells that prevent a monster <br/>
from reacting when its neighbor is attacked, but also for the in-combat <br/>
&quot;lullaby&quot; bard song that &quot;turns off&quot; creatures temporarily (similar to <br/>
enchanter&#39;s Enthrall).  (This double meaning can sometimes cause a lot of <br/>
confusion.)<br/>
<br/>
* You commented that mules are not approved of by Verant and may be deleted <br/>
if found. Where did you get this info? I have two mule characters on a <br/>
friend&#39;s account (one in Freeport and one in Kelethin) that exist mostly to <br/>
hang onto spell research components, since there are enough different ones <br/>
to fill most of a bank account.  I also use them when I need to give <br/>
something to someone but don&#39;t want to hang around waiting for them -- I&#39;ll <br/>
give the item to the holder character, tell the person to let me know when <br/>
they get to the bank, and then log that character in to transfer the item.<br/>
<br/>
* You commented that twinking is not approved of by Verant and may result <br/>
in character deletion. This is definitely not true. Verant has said that <br/>
they don&#39;t care, and that the game has some balance factors that prevent <br/>
low level characters from gaining huge advantage from powerful items.<br/>

A few EQ slang terms I&#39;ve run into that aren&#39;t in your list:<br/>
<br/>
beetle paste - Deep deep red. (Red means &quot;you will die.&quot; Beetle paste red <br/>
means &quot;you and five of your friends will be reduced to beetle paste.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
cowboy - A player who runs off and attacks stuff when the party (or even <br/>
the player himself) isn&#39;t finished recuperating from the last fight.<br/>
<br/>
dress - see &quot;nightie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
momma - mammoth (as opposed to mammoth calf). It&#39;s unwise to attack a calf <br/>
when one of these is nearby.<br/>
<br/>
no drop - Item that can&#39;t be traded or dropped, but sticks around when you <br/>
log out. (cf. No rent)<br/>
<br/>
nuke (2) - see &quot;hose.&quot;  (I&#39;ve never heard &quot;hose&quot; used this way, <br/>
personally.)<br/>
<br/>
smurf - Dark elf.<br/>
<br/>
wanderer - any NPC that wanders around in a dungeon, rather than sitting in <br/>
one place. (&quot;Don&#39;t kill the wanderer in the graveyard - it will pull the <br/>
whole castle!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro</div>
