<div id="ygrps-yiv-486539374">Ah, but if casters didn&#39;t use mana to cast, would Shamans and Clerics sit during<br/>
a fight?  I doubt it, as they get some nice weapons and armor.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that we should class &#39;em by do they use mana or not, since we&#39;re<br/>
the exception.<br/>

&gt;A hybrid/melee will not sit on his/her butt during a fight.<br/>
&gt;A caster/healer will sit on his/her butt during a fight.<br/>

&gt;You deserve bind if you spend 90% of your time on your arse.<br/>
