<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946124010">Greetings!<br/>
I started doing the quests at level 32, and finished at level 38.  I did <br/>
most of the killing, resorting to looting others kills for the bracelet on <br/>
one of the Greater Darkboned Skelies and a couple of lambent stones for the <br/>
sake of the time required to camp/wait in line to join a group to fight the <br/>
mobs (and maybe another item too...can&#39;t remember a couple of kills).  I <br/>
died about 10 times during the quests.  The key to killing the mobs a lower <br/>
than level 30 is obviously a good party.  If a lower level bard (say in the <br/>
high teens to low 20&#39;s) sets the goal of obtaining pieces, it can be done, <br/>
but it depends on the parties the bard can get into or whether the bard can <br/>
make it to the slain mob to loot it.  I personally have respect to any bard <br/>
for completing the quests in any fashion they choose.  I have grouped bards <br/>
15 levels below me in my parties to help them get items for the quest.  I do <br/>
not think the quests are easy.  Some quests are more difficult than others.  <br/>
What are the solutions to making the quests more difficult?  Tougher mobs?  <br/>
No...if a lvl 19 bard can group with a level 40 party, they will to get <br/>
their item.  Also, guilds or friends can do the quest for the bard to get <br/>
around higher level mobs.  I don&#39;t see a clear way Verant can make the quest <br/>
more difficult.  I also don&#39;t see why they should.  Enterprising bards <br/>
should be allowed to risk all (ie corpse in a very bad place)for the big <br/>
reward of lambent.  My only complaint about the quests is that other classes <br/>
can do them.  If I were Verant, I would make lambent quests bard only, or as <br/>
has been stated in this forum make the armor lore.<br/>

&gt;(assuming 25-40 is &quot;mid-level&quot;)  If you finished at 34 then<br/>
&gt;you had &quot;easy&quot; quests.  I personally looted from others kills<br/>
&gt;the following items, any bard with invis song could get these items:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mudwater Rune from Cazic<br/>
&gt;Opalline Helm from Oasis<br/>
&gt;Shin Gauntlets from Lguk<br/>
&gt;Shin Greaves from Lguk<br/>
&gt;Icy Greaves from Perma (semi-risky, ... not really)<br/>
&gt;2 Runes from the One-Eyes in WK<br/>
&gt;Lute in Mistmoore<br/>
&gt;... and more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was overjoyed my quests were this easy at first...then it kinda<br/>
&gt;hit me that i was a blueboy at level 25, and would be wearing mostly<br/>
&gt;the same stuff until the 40s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the armor quests were designed to make us go to unexplored<br/>
&gt;parts of the world, but the bard quests just seemed to be on a lot of<br/>
&gt;the monsters that were already killed, sometimes killed a lot.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree with Kitasi here.  I don&#39;t think our quests are all *that* easy. <br/>
&gt;  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; started doing them at around level 27 and I can assure you that I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; find most of them trivial.  My set wasn&#39;t complete until about 34th.  <br/>
&gt;Sure,<br/>
&gt; &gt; some pieces are easier than others, but even if you&#39;re simply looting <br/>
&gt;quest<br/>
&gt; &gt; items from other people&#39;s kills, it&#39;s still pretty risky.  The Dark Bone<br/>
&gt; &gt; bracelet from the basement of Unrest, the Basalt Carapace from well <br/>
&gt;inside<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lower Guk, the Gypsy Lute from the heart of Castle Mistmoore, the Icy<br/>
&gt; &gt; Greaves from the King Room in Permafrost, these are not easy things to <br/>
&gt;get<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a lower level bard even if you&#39;re scavanging other&#39;s kills.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The bard quests may be easy at 30th level, but I have not found them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly easy at 20ish.  On the other hand I completed my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fourth shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; piece last week with my 21st level bard, and I did all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; required killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; myself for 3 of the pieces.  I&#39;ve also done 3 crafted quests,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; including the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; slaying required, and 1 ranger piece.  I&#39;m halfway thru about 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bard pieces.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you think our quests are easy try some of the others, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; make ours look<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; many levels off for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have had no luck getting the icy greaves despite trying four times <br/>
&gt;now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve spent about 6 hours in the king room with no luck.  I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; others have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been more fortunate on this note, but since the critters involved<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are still<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; far beyond my means for almost all the bard quests, while the critters <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; some of the other classes&#39; quests are not, I don&#39;t believe ours<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are as weak<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as people seem to think.  Our quests are relatively easy for the level<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Verant seems to think should be doing the quests (30-35).  Other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; classes can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get some pieces 10 levels before this easily although some of their <br/>
&gt;pieces<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; may be fairly difficult.<br/>
