<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542582984">I agree, this petition is somewhat uncalled for.   we allready have a heal<br/>
song and stamina song, dont even think about getting a combined one. Thats<br/>
simply pulling teeth.<br/>
<br/>
we allready have an agility song in the 30&#39;s  (35 or 36 i think)<br/>
<br/>
the teleport keep on dreaming, its not gonna happen<br/>
<br/>
Taunt... ever charm a monster yet?  your party nukes can unload all their<br/>
mana and it will still be after you<br/>
<br/>
Bind... forget it you&#39;re pulling teeth again<br/>
<br/>
as far as tracking is concerned, why sing it whe you get a skill in it...<br/>
which is actually higher then a druids.<br/>

If you want to petition about something, petition about thinks like skills<br/>
that cap at 40, utterly useless like hide & forage. Our stick drum will<br/>
supposedly be fixed in the next graphical patch.<br/>

&gt; This is getting silly.  Why on earth would we get a tracking song, when we<br/>
&gt; already get the tracking skill??<br/>

&gt; Item Subject: [eqbards] Petiton to replace level 14 song<br/>
&gt;      Gentle Bards,<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      I agree with your idea in theory but not on your choice of song to <br/>
&gt;      replace.  Just last night I pulled out several items in my bank that <br/>
&gt;      had been sitting around and tried the level 14 song on them.  To my <br/>
&gt;      surprise three of them gave me extra info.  It seems that any item <br/>
&gt;      that says illegible or blurred will now give you extra info with the <br/>
&gt;      song.  Nice touch.  Don&#39;t know when they implemented this but I <br/>
&gt;      finished 2 quests last night with the help of this song and will <br/>
&gt;      finish the third when I get to Qeynos.  This song is still not a real<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      heavyweight but it actually works now and more importantly Verant is <br/>
&gt;      actively using it so they will not be receptive to removing it.  <br/>
&gt;      Perhaps the level 22 song.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      your suggestions<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      1 and 2  Great ideas!<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      3.  They&#39;ll never do it but would be nice.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      4.  I seem to have a perpetual taunt stamped on my forehead. &lt;gr&gt; I <br/>
&gt;      certainly don&#39;t need a taunt song.  <br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      5.  see 3 above<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      Another great idea they&#39;ll never do.  A song that acts like the<br/>
&gt; ranger <br/>
&gt;      track skill.<br/>

&gt; I sent this out about an hour ago but I haven&#39;t received it back from the <br/>
&gt; list yet so sending it again just in case.  Sorry if we end up getting it <br/>
&gt; posted twice.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; Fellow bards,<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; I came into work today and there were relatively few messages on the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In an effort to jumpstart some discussion, I have the following proposal.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; If enough people on this list thinks its a good idea, lets submit a<br/>
&gt; petition<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to have the level 14 song replaced.  As most of you are aware, the song <br/>
&gt; currently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already <br/>
&gt; identified.  All you have to do is right click on it.  The only situations<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; have heard of the song providing any additional information is when it is <br/>
&gt; sung while holding a head.  The name of the person who the head used to be<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; attached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you are turning in <br/>
&gt; the head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses for this<br/>
&gt; song.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; I propose that we also provide Verant with some ideas on a song to replace<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it with.  The biggest thing to remember here is that the power of the new <br/>
&gt; song should be appropriate for a 14th level character.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; minor <br/>
&gt; versions of any higher level song are likely to get approved.  The new<br/>
&gt; song <br/>
&gt; should provide a completely new spell efffect.  I request that everyone <br/>
&gt; submit to this list their idea of what the new 14th level song should be. <br/>
&gt; Once we get several good responses, we can all vote on which ones we think<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; have the best chance of getting approved.  We can then submit the petition<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to Verant with the entire list of suggested new songs ranked in the order<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; vote on.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; Here are a couple of ideas that I have:<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; 1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The <br/>
&gt; power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or<br/>
&gt; toned <br/>
&gt; down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; 2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  The <br/>
&gt; amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you<br/>
&gt; sing <br/>
&gt; Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an <br/>
&gt; instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; 3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.  This <br/>
&gt; song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order for<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Verant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in outdoor zones<br/>
&gt; (no<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; dungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a high skill <br/>
&gt; level in the instrument that is required to play it.  If you miss a note<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; fail, the song button grays out for a specified amount of time before you <br/>
&gt; can try it again.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; 4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal <br/>
&gt; bard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters are getting <br/>
&gt; mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if <br/>
&gt; someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; 5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think this <br/>
&gt; one would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can include it if <br/>
&gt; thats what everyone wants.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; These are what I came up with on the fly.  Make any modifications to these<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that you like.  Submit new ideas if you have one.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m in the Army and will be going out on a field exercise this Thursday<br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; the next week.  Assuming this message generates a lot of positive<br/>
&gt; response, <br/>
&gt; someone else will have to facilitate discussion on this issue until then.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; will write up the petition when I get back next week if we all come to an <br/>
&gt; agreement.<br/>
