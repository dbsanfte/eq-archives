<div id="ygrps-yiv-944906079">I use AE songs in dungeons all the time.  I am always told not to, I <br/>
ignore them.  Sometimes you&#39;ll find out that the layout of the spot <br/>
you&#39;re in isn&#39;t appropriate for an AE song (i.e., you&#39;ll get trained), so <br/>
you add that to your list of places not to sing.  Blame it on some weapon <br/>
proc.  hehe.  Largo&#39;s I&#39;ve rarely had trouble with.  Using the absolute <br/>
rule &quot;no AE in dungeons&quot; doesn&#39;t maximize your usefulness; you need to <br/>
balance risk and reward, which you can only do by trying it out.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have never<br/>
&gt; &gt; used CoD or DDD in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; dungeon for fear of this bug.  I have used Largos on<br/>
&gt; &gt; numerous occasions in<br/>
&gt; &gt; dungeons and have never had it cause a train due to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bug.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for this...haven&#39;t used Largos in a dungeon for<br/>
&gt; fear of this.  will try it now. </span></blockquote></div>
