&gt;Step 1: Bard has two flutes in his inventory.  One is in a container and<br/>
&gt;another in a main inventory slot.<br/>
&gt;Step 2: Bard groups with someone who can bind and gets bound in an evil city<br/>
&gt;right next to the zone border.<br/>
&gt;Step 3: The bard and the person who bound him go into the next zone, i.e.<br/>
&gt;Innothule Swamp, Feerot, and duel right next to the zone border to the evil<br/>
&gt;city.  Bard lets the other person kill him in the duel.<br/>
&gt;Step 4: Bard reappears in evil city, goes to the zone where he is killed,<br/>
&gt;and loots everything from his corpse except the flute in the main inventory.<br/>
&gt;Bard sings invis song, using flute that was in a container, to get past<br/>
&gt;guards and goes adventuring.<br/>
&gt;Step 5: If bard dies while adventuring, he can then loot his corpse to get<br/>
&gt;the second flute, sing invis song, and safely get back to his corpse. <br/>
&gt;Step 6: Rinse and repeat Steps 1-3 to get another corpse with spare flute.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A Whole lotta trouble for that, and you also have to have someone who can<br/>
duel you, and this only solves it once. If you die a second time that<br/>
night, yer SOL.  Seems like a whole lotta trouble for nothing.<br/>
