of questions.  Who will do the most damage with it?  Who will<br/>
have the easiest time finding better weapons?  Who will use it<br/>
the most/longest?  Who has helped your group the most/died the<br/>
most helping your group and thus as &quot;earned&quot; a nice item?<br/>
<br/>
If your friends are considering only who will do more damage,<br/>
then they must be powergamers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is slightly different.  Casters gain virtually zero<br/>
advantage from using a FBSS.  Because of funny behavior of<br/>
haste items I just recently found, whereas other melee classes<br/>
would get a 20% haste out of it (unless grouped with a<br/>
bard/enchanter), a bard your level will get a 46% haste out of<br/>
it (20% Celerity -&gt; 75% max).  So arguably a bard would be<br/>
*better* able to use the FBSS than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
You really have to discuss loot distribution with everyone<br/>
before-hand and arrive at some sort of consensus.  Because<br/>
bards are mediocre at everything, they typically end up<br/>
getting shafted on most of the high end item distributions.  <br/>
You have to make sure that, for example, if your friends are<br/>
going to demote you on the EBW and FBSS lists, then they<br/>
should promote you on something else, like a Ykesha, to<br/>
balance things out.<br/>
