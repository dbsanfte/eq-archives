&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for changing the subject, but I would like to see other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reaction on the &quot;new and improved&quot; bard hate.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I pretty much agree with you that it&#39;s been reduced.  I just<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted to comment on something here.<br/>

&gt; everyone<br/>

&gt; &gt; kobolds, and various bugs all run through me and never aggro<br/>

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the way it works for bards is that if you&#39;re in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the aggro radius and your song pulses, that almost always adds<br/>
&gt; &gt; you to the hate list.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually this is not just unique to bards.  ANY caster that fires off a<br/>
&gt; spell (of certain types - healing, buff, etc) within agro range of a mob<br/>

&gt; This has been an issue since Beta, Phase 4, when faction hits were<br/>
&gt; implemented against _anyone_ who assists in combat against an NPC.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately it appears that this &#39;feature&#39; was a case of severely lazy<br/>
&gt; coding on Verant&#39;s part.  You don&#39;t have to actually be &#39;assisting&#39; in the<br/>
&gt; kill or even &#39;assisting&#39; the person doing the killing.  All you have to be<br/>
&gt; doing is &#39;casting&#39; any beneficial (or aggressive) spell in the nearby<br/>
&gt; vicinity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Side note:  Be real careful about singing healing or buffs in the Freeport<br/>
&gt; Bank area if someone is attacking the militia spy in the bank.  You WILL<br/>
&gt; take a militia faction hit when he dies if you do.<br/>
