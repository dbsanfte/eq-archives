 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve concinced me, I think you are gonna be dead right about this one.<br/>
Particularly after the spectre of legal recourse for in-game injustices was<br/>
raised today on this list. Yup, it&#39;s going to happen, and yeah, I think<br/>
after a very painful adolecence, virtual communities will develop to the<br/>
point you describe.<br/>
<br/>
Virtually (yuck yuck) no one &quot;gets&quot; what is going on out here, and after the<br/>
virtual community matures in it&#39;s expectations and  a few civil lawsuits<br/>
establish precident we are going to see professionally run virtual worlds<br/>
that don&#39;t cater to adolecents (of any age) need to vandalize and predate on<br/>
everything and everyone they can. Heh, and it will cost $39.95 a month and I<br/>
bet a bunch of people on this list will pay it :o)<br/>
