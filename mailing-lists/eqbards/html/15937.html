Hello,<br/>
This morning, we became aware that someone is sending out email to EQ<br/>
Customers directing them to change their password to one provided in the<br/>
email, then instructing the customer to email their station name back to an<br/>
address in the aol.com domain. Evidence suggests that the party sending this<br/>
mail is taking email addresses from fan site Web Boards and the EverQuest<br/>
Usenet newsgroups.<br/>
<br/>
Please be aware that this is a scam to perpetuated by someone who is<br/>
attempting to fraudulently gain access to your account. It was NOT sent by<br/>
Verant Interactive nor The <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Station@...">Station@...</a>. Official Representatives for<br/>
EverQuest will never ask you for your password, and though we may instruct<br/>
you to change your it, we will not instruct you to change it to something<br/>
specified by us.<br/>
<br/>
Any official email correspondence in regards to EverQuest will come from<br/>
either verant.com or station.sony.com. Please be aware that it is very easy<br/>
to make an email appear official, and then have replies sent to an outside<br/>
fraudulent address when you hit the &quot;Reply&quot; button. You should double-check<br/>
the return address of any correspondence that appears official to insure<br/>
that it goes to the verant.com or station.sony.com domains. <br/>
<br/>
Please remember to keep your account information safe and private. If you<br/>
have any questions about the authenticity of any email correspondence you<br/>
receive, please send inquiries to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqmail@...">eqmail@...</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
