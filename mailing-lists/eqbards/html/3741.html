experience is time playing the game.  Running back to your<br/>
corpse most people consider worthless downtime.  While a lower<br/>
experience loss may result in reaching level 50 more quickly,<br/>
long runs to your corpse decrease the percentage of your<br/>
/played time that is spent actually playing the game (fighting<br/>
monsters).<br/>
