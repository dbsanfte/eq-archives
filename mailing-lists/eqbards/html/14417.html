<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235261850">Hail all,<br/>
I&#39;m here to ask a few questions, in the past this list has done me right...so I&#39;m back for more :-)<br/>
<br/>
1.    Last week I was in SK beating up treants(I know, I know bad juju with druids, but I have faction to burn) when the necro in the party went LD, I was still singing DDD and suddenly his Pet is on me like white on rice(glad it was the level 20 pet hehe) has anyone else had this happen to them? I was able to kill it with 59 HP left.<br/>
<br/>
2.    My other toon is a mage(20th Level) and he is now in OOT soloing gargoyles. Can I do the same with my bard or will the gargoyles rip me a new one?<br/>
<br/>
3.    I like many here only can play for about 2-4 hours a night 4 nights a week, so a regular group is out of the question, hell my guildmates second chars are starting to pass me in levels. So my question is where is good to hunt solo or in a pickup&lt;shudders&gt; group? I&#39;m burnt out with Lake Rathe and SK been there since 17th when I left that hell on Norrath HighPass.<br/>
<br/>
4.    My current weapon load is Bladed Claws in Primary, Silvery 1h axe secondary, and Dragoon Dirk in Ranged slot, I sometime switch in a BE Mace in secondary to raise 1hb so I can use the Head Bopper Staff I have in the bank when I make 29th. Is this a good weapon load or should I change anything around ?<br/>
<br/>
In closing I must say great list keep up the good work and fight for Bards rights everywhere. Also anyone hear about the possibility of a new bard race in the expansion? or if they have even started Beta testing yet?<br/>
