<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029034425"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;Try remaping the attack key to something even more usuless, like the `/~ key<br/>
&gt; &gt;or the + key on the VERY FAR right of the keyboard.  I have found if I<br/>
&gt; &gt;mistype I usually hit the key too far inside rather then outside, and have<br/>
&gt; &gt;fewer deaths for poor typing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh - I remapped it to &#39;x&#39; - it&#39;s close and convenient, without there being<br/>
&gt; a chance of me typing it before I realize I mistyped. Think about it -<br/>
&gt; unless you&#39;re talking about OOC stuff (which you shouldn&#39;t be to an NPC),<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s no possible way to hit &#39;x&#39; before I hit &#39;space&#39; which is jump.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have mine remapped to the &#39;/&#39; key on the keypad (right next to autorun).<br/>
True, there&#39;s times that I accidently end up overrunning the mob instead<br/>
of hitting it, but I have _never_ hit it accidently in a social encounter<br/>
either.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, having Lament and Carillon mixed up (and in the slot for the<br/>
other) is something I have done...which ended up being a very painful<br/>
lesson in doublechecking and triplechecking songs whenever I&#39;m near an<br/>
NPC. ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Makes more sense now that I rationalize it, since it was a rather arbitrary<br/>
&gt; decision to begin with *grins*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Talies the rationalizer<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since when have you been rational, Talies?  And is there a cure for it?<br/>
*grins*<br/>
