<div id="ygrps-yiv-705610129">The way I see it, the primary purpose of a pet should be to act as a<br/>
defensive barrier between the mob and the caster.  In other words, the pet<br/>
keeps stuff off of the caster so the caster&#39;s spell don&#39;t get interrupted.<br/>
This does not necessarily mean the pet is inflicting a lot of damage.  The<br/>
primary source of damage that the mob gets hit for should come from the<br/>
caster&#39;s spells, not the pet.  If the mob starts to attack the caster, the<br/>
pet should a built in Taunt skill to draw the mob off the caster.<br/>

I just started up a newbie magician the other day so my opinion is subject<br/>
to change 180 degrees as I play him more:-)<br/>

PS There was a recent post on the official EQ site from a 50 warrior who had<br/>
dueled a 50 necro.  The only thing the necro did was sic his pet on the<br/>
warrior.  He didn&#39;t cast any spells.  The necro pet won:-).  Abashi&#39;s<br/>
response was that the warrior didn&#39;t have the right equipment for a 50<br/>
warrior (warrior was in crafted) and that he must not have used a good<br/>
strategy against the pet.  I was always under the impression that there<br/>
wasn&#39;t much strategy to playing a warrior. Hit AutoAttack and start pushing<br/>
the bash/slam/kick/taunt buttons.  Despite what Abashi said, IMO a pet<br/>
should never beat or even come close to beating an equal level melee class.<br/>

PPS Is this the list record for longest OT thread?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; Heh bards aren&#39;t melee classes they don&#39;t even have double attack and<br/>
&gt; until<br/>
&gt; &gt; you get a yekeshas or two you can&#39;t do much.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Naeeldar<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s my point.  Necros aren&#39;t melee classes either, and are<br/>
&gt; supposed to be less of a melee class than bards.  Therefore it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t make sense that they have the ability to do more melee<br/>
&gt; damage than bards.<br/>
