&gt; there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  do you disagree with the statement that<br/>
&gt; if you spend more time in the game you should have better items and attain<br/>
&gt; higher levels?  True casual gamers aren&#39;t concerned that much with items<br/>
&gt; and levels.  the only people upset by this statement are the power gamers<br/>
&gt; who don&#39;t have time to put into the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uhh that&#39;s not true at all.  Casual gamers are generally still interested in<br/>
being able to participate in quests and adventures to attain neat or unique<br/>
items.  I would hazard that most &quot;Casual&quot; gamers would even like to some day<br/>
reach high levels.  Even Role Players like to reach high levels.<br/>
<br/>
All players should be able to participate in events.  The problem that I<br/>
have with most GM event&#39;s isn&#39;t that they are &quot;Stupid&quot;, however, it&#39;s that<br/>
unless the GM&#39;s get very &quot;evil&quot; and start punting players who interfere<br/>
there is no way for a dynamic event to keep the 50&#39;s from ruining the fun of<br/>
low level events.<br/>
<br/>
I was a Guide and I can tell you that MANY of the events are actually aimed<br/>
at those around level 15 to 35 or so.  The problem is  that whenever one of<br/>
those events kicks off the 50&#39;s waltz in and blast the actors to smitherines<br/>
because they think it may have neat stuff.  Which ruins the event for the<br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
Let me rephrase that:<br/>
It&#39;s not the GM&#39;s fault that the PLAYERS can&#39;t respect events enough not to<br/>
ruin it for themselves.<br/>
