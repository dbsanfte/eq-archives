<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237878920">The other day when i was hunting in Steamfont a Guide showed up and was just<br/>
standing there next to us.  He was kind of fun to talk to, explained to us<br/>
why we dont see GM Solist anymore on Sol Ro, Seems he got killed by Nagafen.<br/>
And from there a second guide guild was formed, an evil one...<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, i asked him if he would race me, i equipped my mm drum and blasted<br/>
way ahead of him, but turned out he didnt have run on (duh)<br/>
<br/>
Next 2 rounds of races we did we were neck and neck for each race.  Im sure<br/>
my level 40 friend would of left him in the dust<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s still around when i hit level 50, we&#39;ve got another race to do, me<br/>
and this little gnome<br/>
 <br/>
i think i gave him a new respect for bards and their speed.<br/>

&gt; Hiya,<br/>
&gt; Dont know if this is of any interest, but its bardic related.<br/>
&gt; Inspirered by the thread about running back to your corpse I decided to<br/>
&gt; time my<br/>
&gt; run From Qeynos gates to West freeport through Highpass hold (Invisio on<br/>
&gt; when I<br/>
&gt; passed through there).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My stats: Woodelf bard, Level 22, Hand drum.<br/>
&gt; The time: 31min.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I was at it I also timed how long time it took me to zone (From<br/>
&gt; &quot;loading<br/>
&gt; please wait&quot; until I could move on the other side): 40-60 secs(Dont have<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; exact times here, but never above 60secs, that much I remember)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My pc&#39;s stats:<br/>
&gt; P166MMX running 188/75MHz<br/>
&gt; Flash3D voodoo I card.<br/>
&gt; Win98<br/>
&gt; 96MB Ram, BTW started with 64 in beta, My advice? 96MB is a minimum!<br/>
&gt; Connection: ISDN 64Kbit/s<br/>
