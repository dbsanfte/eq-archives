&gt; Keith - at the risk of setting off some of the more purest of our group -<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll try to help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not bard related no - but I&#39;ve found a definite trend in bards - we are<br/>
&gt; people that LIKE being a jack of all trades - and that DOES seem to extend<br/>
&gt; to trade skills as well. I think it&#39;s just the personality that is<br/>
&gt; attracted to the barding class in the first place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most named skins are used in quests - somewhere or other. That said - no,<br/>
&gt; you can&#39;t tailor with them - but they ARE the new &#39;secret&#39; ingredient in<br/>
&gt; pottery for making poison vials. From what I&#39;ve read, just about any named<br/>
&gt; animal skin is supposed to work for that - but I&#39;ve not done it myself -<br/>
&gt; probably not scalps tho.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In tailoring, I know the basics of patchwork armor - ruined wolf, cat and<br/>
&gt; &gt;bear pelts. MQ or HQ pelts for backpacks and studded/reinforced armor,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt;there are some furs that I haven&#39;t seen a use for that I&#39;m curious if<br/>
anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;knows about. Black Wolf Fur (not ruined, med quality or high quality -<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt;black wolf fur) and Rat Fur. And how about Deathfist Pawn orc scalps? Can<br/>
&gt; &gt;tailors make anything with the above types of furs? Are there other furs<br/>
&gt; &gt;that can be used in tailoring? I have purchased the Tailoring book and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;how-to-sew books, but none of them mention the above.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found that any nonrace meat (at least all I&#39;ve tried) can be made<br/>
into<br/>
&gt; sandwiches - and yes - a spit is exactly that, a portable oven. I&#39;ve NEVER<br/>
&gt; BOTHERED WITH ANY TYPE OF BOOK - do some searches around the net - there<br/>
&gt; are lots of sites that have receipes, brewing tips, pottery tips, smithing<br/>
&gt; tips, etc. Most of these ARE the books - just transcribed to the web.<br/>
BTW -<br/>
&gt; beware these books - many have glaring errors which if you follow, are<br/>
&gt; simply wrong and fail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In baking, can any meat be mixed with bread to make sandwhiches? Is a<br/>
spit<br/>
&gt; &gt;sort of like a portable oven? I&#39;ve purchased the first delicicies book<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt;just can&#39;t imagine buying 10 baking books for recipies.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If anyone has any web pages that do a very good job of describing the<br/>
above<br/>
&gt; &gt;two skills, I&#39;d very much appreciate it. My Bard is looking for<br/>
knowledge.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d considered jewelry, but I believe it&#39;s just way too expensive. Tell<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; &gt;if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here are just a few sites (besides EQVault and Stratics of course) that<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; might find helpful.<br/>
