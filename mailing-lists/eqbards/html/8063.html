<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974329444"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Actually, I agree with him.  &quot;Kiting&quot; has come to mean killing<br/>
&gt;a monster in a fashion which poses zero risk to yourself<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That may be your interpretation of the word, along with others,<br/>
but that is not what it means at all to me.<br/>
<br/>
kiting: to go in a rapid or flighty manner. (webster&#39;s)<br/>
<br/>
Kiting as the word in EQ has come to mean dragging around<br/>
a monster, much as you suggested some bard do with extra <br/>
bandits as he runs around with accelerando on.  Reversing<br/>
that role, you are not fleeing, rather following a fleeing<br/>
creature, is reverse-kiting.<br/>
<br/>
Still, you realize this is a conversation of semantics, thus<br/>
it really has no room for argument.  I say tomato, you say<br/>
tomatoe.  Let it be, was my point.<br/>
