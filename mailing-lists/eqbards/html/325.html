<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve been to the soerbaird site, and it&#39;s very nice looking.<br/>
&gt;You can see lots of bard tales and songs made up by people<br/>
&gt;playing as bards in eq.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you, this is the part of our Annals that we work the hardest on, and<br/>
in fact contains most of what we Soerbaird spend our time doing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But if I am correct that all such information is secreted away,<br/>
&gt;then I have heard enough about the clique known as<br/>
&gt;the soerbairds. If y&#39;all want to go have your private little<br/>
&gt;group and harvest a bunch of information which you then keep<br/>
&gt;to yourself, then I for one don&#39;t want to hear the<br/>
&gt;name of your clubby club on this list again. Any information<br/>
&gt;that I am able to unearth about the bard profession is<br/>
&gt;public knowledge as far as I&#39;m concerned and I would be happy<br/>
&gt;to have it repeated to any struggling or curious bard out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I missed a link or something, then I apologize in advance,<br/>
&gt;and long live the soerbaird :P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I think disturbs me most about this, is that you admit to not being<br/>
able to find the information on our site, yet you proceed with your libel<br/>
as if your assumption was true. I&#39;ve noticed a similar pattern from those<br/>
who wish to defame the name of the Soerbaird--that little evidence to our<br/>
&#39;cliquish&#39; behavior or &#39;secret knowledge&#39; is provided, yet you continue to<br/>
accuse us of such. <br/>
<br/>
Also, your acceptance of our group or its goals is based on whether or not<br/>
we have a list of bard songs available to the public? Again, that you would<br/>
judge us based on what services you percieve we should provide to our<br/>
memebers rather than our ACTUAL character and deeds, I find that very<br/>
disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to hold court in a public forum, rather than taking your issues<br/>
up personally with me, then please be more forthright with your evidence so<br/>
that we may answer for it.<br/>
<br/>
We have never withheld information about the bardic profession from any<br/>
bard if asked, and we try to respond to every question on this list that we<br/>
can answer, and we respond to them truthfully. We do have a song list which<br/>
existed on an older site, but as of yet has not been moved to the new site.<br/>
When it is, I will let you know.<br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
