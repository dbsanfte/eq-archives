 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never seen one of these for sale.  Perhaps a trip to the area is in<br/>
order to hang around and see who has one weighing them down.<br/>
<br/>
Any idea what one might cost?  I&#39;m flat broke and overweight from some<br/>
recent purchases of small bronze (thank Tunare I&#39;m a Wood Elf and can<br/>
wear the small stuff - the medium is going for twice as much...).<br/>
Would be nice to know how much cash to bring before I make the long run.<br/>

Tip o the Day: If your in your low teens, West Commons is a great place<br/>
to hunt, both for xp and loot.  Bring a magic weapon and watch out for<br/>
giants and griffons.</div>
