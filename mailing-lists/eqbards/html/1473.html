&gt; &gt; The Eq&#39;lizer site lists the only place that sells the Level 14 song<br/>

&gt; &gt; of where in Erudin this shop is (e.g. by the palace, by the docks,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc.).<br/>

&gt; Where would you find a CATALOGing LIBRetto?  Where would<br/>
&gt; Erudites store their vast COLLECTION OF BOOKS containing all<br/>
&gt; their KNOWLEDGE about songs and spells?  :-)<br/>

just give it away?) the real question is, why bother to buy this song, since<br/>
it is currently completely useless.  :(<br/>
