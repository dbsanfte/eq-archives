<div id="ygrps-yiv-940369631">Heh!  WTG on the EBW!!  Coolness!<br/>
<br/>
I was cruising thru Runnyeye and went down to see if I could nab a BIBS<br/>
(sword) and ran into a 50 druid who was camping for a BIC (crown).  We<br/>
chatted and I offered my BIC as trade bait but we could not agree - so in<br/>
the end I just gave him the BIC and said &quot;you can owe me one...&quot;  Hehe,<br/>
well, he decided he did not wanna be in debt so he gave me a butler tooth!<br/>
<br/>
Asking around in my guild I found that a druid had 2 maid&#39;s teeth and a<br/>
warrior had a butler tooth. So, I traded my butler for a maid and gave the<br/>
maid to the warrior.  Hehe, so now they each got the stuff to make EBW&#39;s.<br/>
Too bad they are no drops that don&#39;t proc.<br/>
<br/>

p.s. everyone in our guild is now 2YK compliant &lt;eg&gt; including yours truly!<br/>

		Our first guild night in Mistmoore, we killed the butler and<br/>
		got a fang.  <br/>
<br/>
		[snipage]<br/>
<br/>
		So basically, I got both fangs off the first butler and maid<br/>
I<br/>
		ever killed.  :-P I had to wait longer for the avenging<br/>
		caitiff to show up (6 hours) than I did for the butler or<br/>
the<br/>
		maid. :)  I couldn&#39;t figure out how to get him to give me<br/>
the<br/>
		quest info, so I took a chance and just gave him both fangs.<br/>
<br/>
		Presto - electrum bladed wakizashi (7 dam 21 delay 2 wt).<br/>
<br/>
		I think I will dual wield it with my sceptre of rahotep when<br/>
I<br/>
		feel like showing off rare weapons (yeah, I ran across him<br/>
		too).  :)<br/>
