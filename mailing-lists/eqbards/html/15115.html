<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153264090"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1.  This the second time in 2 weeks they changed the date on a major<br/>
&gt; scheduled downtime.  My bother scheduling downtime, if you;re not going<br/>
&gt; to keep it?  My cleric group plays once a week (and is the main reason I<br/>
&gt; play EQ, I love my bard, but I think i would leave the game if I didn;t<br/>
&gt; have my regular cleric group).  We make sure our day does not coincide<br/>
&gt; with their scheduled downtime since we face such time constraints<br/>
&gt; (normally play from 5ish to 11ish). The rest of the group was able to<br/>
&gt; get in around 7, so our time this week was cut by 1/3, despite our best<br/>
&gt; efforts.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  Why aren&#39;t these downtimes scheduled about 3-5 horus earlier, when<br/>
&gt; there are many less paying customers trying to play?  I feel bad for the<br/>
&gt; people in Europe in Asia, but America represents the majority of their<br/>
&gt; customer base.  I would even be happier if they would rotate down times<br/>
&gt; so different people were affected each time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What, you expect the Verant folks to get up at 2am?? :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.  How much time was wasted writing the True North spell.  I&#39;m sure we<br/>
&gt; could all name about 20 things which everyone in the game would rather<br/>
&gt; have seen that time spent fixing.  Has anyone thought of a use for this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have loved this at level 1.  I can&#39;t remember how many times I got<br/>
lost in Toxxulia Forest because there is no path, no easily visible<br/>
landmarks, and fog you can&#39;t see past 30 feet in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4.  How do things which directly contradict the patch messages make it<br/>
&gt; past their &quot;extensive testing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You misunderstand... doing &quot;extensive testing&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they<br/>
fix what they test. :)<br/>
