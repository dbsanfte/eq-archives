<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101487445">Not a hell level?  How long has it taken you to reach 51? &lt;eg&gt; Ok, since I<br/>
am talking totally out of hearsay, rumor and second hand info (ie my highest<br/>
level made is only 40), I been told it&#39;s really hard to gain xp (all greens,<br/>
or hard stuff) and have also heard it called &#39;it&#39;s the level of nothing to<br/>
do.&#39;  My 50 fiends say &quot;no reason to play sonso unless going on a good<br/>
raid...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And yet I see others going to same places Lguk, SolB and shouting for<br/>
groups.  So my comment on 50 being ultimate hell was more about that stuff<br/>
than the rate that you gain xp - although I was told its pretty boring to<br/>
build xp at 50.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear from you (all you 50&#39;s) more about what it&#39;s really like.<br/>
