made warrior only. So far it hasn&#39;t happened so no need to worry, yet.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Last night in lower guk a fellow was auctioning a &quot;shark-skin drum&quot; that<br/>
&gt;&gt; he<br/>
&gt;&gt; said he picked up in Kedge Keep and he claimed that a bard friend who<br/>
&gt;&gt; tested<br/>
&gt;&gt; it for him said that it was about 15% faster speed increase over the MM<br/>
&gt;&gt; drum.  I tried to trade an Enameled Black Chestplate for it but he wanted<br/>
&gt;&gt; like 10kpp worth of stuff for it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth of loot but<br/>
&gt;&gt; that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;makes<br/>
&gt;&gt; the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and the price<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyone have any knowledge/comments on these rumors?<br/>

&gt; Abashi has said that there aren&#39;t going to be changes to the SSOY.<br/>
&gt;Whether this holds true or not...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Never heard of the drum<br/>
