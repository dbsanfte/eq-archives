<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216361947">Yup!  PAW is still the same excitement it was way back in beta (and early<br/>
final) when I lived there ;)  It&#39;s just high enough level that I was able to<br/>
do it &quot;again&quot; when I hit level 30 way back when ;)  Was actually really cool<br/>
to be able to go back and re-visit my teenage stomping grounds as an<br/>
&quot;adult&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
PAW has always been one of my favorite dungeons in the game.  The layout is<br/>
very unique with lots of cool things to do and see.  When they raised the<br/>
level I was _thrilled_ that I could go and have fun again.  And I can still<br/>
go and have fun, even at level 45 ;)<br/>

&gt; Splitpaw - most everything is fooled by invis.  Invis up and you can go<br/>
&gt; pretty much anywhere (only named mobs are likely to see you if even they<br/>
&gt; do.)  But after that, be aware that Paw mobs have a large &quot;social&quot; radius.<br/>
&gt; Attack one and others will &quot;know&quot; about it.  Healers will heal the one you<br/>
&gt; are fighting if it&#39;s within the social range.  A single group will need to<br/>
&gt; pick their spots carefully.  Learn the patrol routes and find a place or<br/>
&gt; room you can clear - then pull to that room.  Also, at your level, you<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; prolly not be able to pull singles without using lament and even then you<br/>
&gt; will have to pick carefully.  Have your druid save mana for evac and dont<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; afraid to use it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Iirc, the kisch drops back near the old commander&#39;s room.  As deep as you<br/>
&gt; can go on one side of the dungeon.  And it&#39;s near where the old shaman&#39;s<br/>
&gt; line was.  There were like 6 to 8 mobs in close proximity - all shamans -<br/>
&gt; and they would heal if your fights got too close.  They would attack if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; were low enough relative to their level.  Cant remember what they are now<br/>
&gt; but the AI is the same - just the mob levels are 15-20 levs higher.<br/>

&gt; My regular group (28 Pally, 29 druid and 28 warrior)<br/>
&gt; and I at 32 are hunting the entrance to Infected PAW<br/>
&gt; tonight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking at the map from eqatlas.com, looks like the<br/>
&gt; fabled Kisch drops very far from the entrance but my<br/>
&gt; initial contact with the place was very intense and<br/>
&gt; enjoyable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lots of action in this place -- looks to me like two<br/>
&gt; full groups are needed to keep the entry areas clean<br/>
&gt; of spawn...we&#39;ll prolly be here a bit since the xp and<br/>
&gt; loot rock.  That said, can anyone give me advice on<br/>
&gt; invading the deeper regions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
