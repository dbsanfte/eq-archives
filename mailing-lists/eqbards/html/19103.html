<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057376103">When you&#39;re staring at the spellbook, you have to actually hit the palette<br/>
key with the mouse to do anything -- including Sense Heading.<br/>
That&#39;s a more general problem.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve noticed that assist doesn&#39;t always work :(<br/>
Sometimes it does not seem to target the same thing that <br/>
the person you are assisting is hitting.<br/>
<br/>
But. Its better than nothing.<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s how you do it.. /assist &lt;name&gt; BUT, you have to be in fairly close<br/>
&gt;proximity, and mine won&#39;t work if I&#39;m staring at my spell book and hit the<br/>
&gt;number key associated with it.  For some reason when I&#39;m looking at my<br/>
&gt;spellbook I actually have to hit the palette key with the mouse.  Hope it<br/>
&gt;works!<br/>
