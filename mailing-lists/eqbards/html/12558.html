to replace the bronze cloak I had been wearing.  I was told it had been<br/>
looted off an ice giant, and didn&#39;t really think much of it at the time.<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen it drop from one myself, nor heard of it happening again,<br/>
so it&#39;s possible the guy that gave it to me had just happened to kill<br/>
Karg.<br/>
