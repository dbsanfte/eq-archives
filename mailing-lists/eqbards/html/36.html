&gt; Since they are part fighter, strength sounds like it could use some. Maybe<br/>

that are very often forgotten about but become EXTREMELY valuable during<br/>
the game and can help reduce frustration over character performance. One<br/>
determines the likelihood that your strike will hit, the other<br/>
determines the likelihood that you will avoid being struck. It really<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter how strong you are if you miss all the time, and it&#39;s far<br/>
better to avoid blows altogether than to worry about having enough HP to<br/>
withstand them, eh?<br/>
