<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774425630">From what I&#39;ve been reading on the boards, you&#39;re not alone.  If you <br/>
simply can&#39;t back out of DX8, then try reinstalling your sound drivers - <br/>
some people have reported success with that.  The other &quot;standard&quot; answers <br/>
that the guides are giving include reducing sound realism, and then <br/>
increasing it again.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck :P<br/>

&gt;them etc.) were so faint I could only hear them if I put my ear right next<br/>
&gt;to my speaker.  I could, however, still hear howling wind and birds chirping<br/>
&gt;and my own avatar&#39;s footsteps.  Another weird thing is I could only hear<br/>
&gt;spell sounds when someone cast the spell on me...It was an eerie night in<br/>

&gt;Maybe someone has some advice, I would hate to have to figure out how to<br/>
&gt;back out DX8 manually that seems like a bad task.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am using a SoundBlaster Ensoniq PCI64 soundcard which came with my crappy<br/>
&gt;HP Pavilion 8280 when I bought it 2 years ago and I have never had any video<br/>
&gt;or sound problems before in EQ or anything else for that matter.<br/>
