<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547009256">Lol. Thanks for the credit, but I was for a tuba, Slyde is the one who would kill for a trombone.<br/>
<br/>
Hilarious idea btw. :-)<br/>

&gt; If Verant were to implement trombones with graphics we would be obligated<br/>
&gt; to get 76 of us together on one server just to march through the most<br/>
&gt; populous zones.  Let&#39;s petition for trombones now! :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other instruments Norrath is lacking:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; String: Vilia&#39;s Violin - Below a certain string skill level it will reverse<br/>
&gt; any healing effects of songs played.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Percussion:  Grand Piano - Weight 500, increases songs by 50%  Throw it<br/>
&gt; into a weight reducing pack and only whip it out for the Chants, not the<br/>
&gt; travelling songs.  Nothing like raiding The Hole as a pianist &lt;evil grin&gt;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wind: Kelin&#39;s Kazoo - increases the knock-back effect of Pixie Strike but<br/>
&gt; reverses the effect of Charismatic Carillon, also has a -5 CHA attribute<br/>
&gt; and has a strong taunt effect.  Mobs WILL hit you in the face when you play<br/>
&gt; this.  So might party members.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brass:  Archangel Gabriel&#39;s Trumpet - Playing it will bring the server<br/>
&gt; down, but wouldn&#39;t it still be cool to have?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Peace<br/>
&gt; Evulia, 14.8 and crawling, Tunare<br/>
