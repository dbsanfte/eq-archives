&gt; &gt; Selo&#39;s Shooting Star (39th?)<br/>

&gt; Uhhhh... do you honestly think they&#39;ll allow this?<br/>

&gt; Why not? I can weave Selo&#39;s and Aria now. Why not throw in a song that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they split up Selo&#39;s and Clouding on purpose.  I seem to recall GZ<br/>
stating that Solon&#39;s was intentionally coded so that singing another song<br/>
with it would interrupt it.  Then again maybe they&#39;ll let up on that since<br/>
this _is_ an over-50 song.  I like the idea but I doubt they&#39;ll let us have<br/>
a song that is _THAT_ useful.  ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; A new charm song, if not full charm then atleast a charm animal song<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Charm animal is utterly useless (and pointless) for a bard.  90% of the<br/>
&gt; zones we go to do not have animals high enough to bother with.  Remember<br/>
&gt; that our charm is already limited by the fact that we have to re-charm<br/>

&gt; &quot;lose&quot; our charm at 37.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Charm animal useless?  Talk to the druids in Sol B that charm sonic bats<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; night long.....<br/>
&gt; Also the expansion is going to have high level outdoor zones.  I am sure<br/>
&gt; there will be some 50+ animals to play with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s 1 dungeon.  Sure there will be other zones.  But I&#39;d rather not give<br/>
Verant the idea to give us _just_ charm animal.  We _deserve_ an upgrade to<br/>
our current _unrestricted_ charm.  Why accept something less?  If you think<br/>
about it there are FAR more places _without_ lvl 37+ animals than places<br/>
with them.  I&#39;d rather not have yet another song that I will rarely use when<br/>
I already have one that&#39;s better :(<br/>

&gt; &gt; Clarity.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Fully stacks with Hymn of Restoration, Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity,<br/>
&gt; Niv&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Melody of Preservation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Interesting but I think this would be far too powerful.  twice hymn + jig<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; clarity?  uhh.... and stackable?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hymn x 2 at 50th would = 35 a tick healing.  Not really that overpowered,<br/>
&gt; imo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uhh<br/>
Nivs = 15hp / tic.  Hymn = 17hp/tic this=35hp/tic<br/>
Total= roughly 70hp/tic<br/>
I seriously doubt Verant will go for something like this that, on top of all<br/>
that, throws on Clarity, a spell shield, and whatever else nivs does.</div>
