&gt; &gt;Subject: [eqbards] Rules and FAQ 1.6 - PLEASE READ<br/>
&gt; THIS!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 17 Dec 1999 14:57:37 -0600<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List,<br/>
&gt; a mailing list<br/>
&gt; &gt;dedicated to all for and about the Bard in<br/>
&gt; EverQuest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;This list will be posted semi-regularly, and<br/>
&gt; updated as often as is needed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;If you have any suggestions, or any frequently<br/>
&gt; asked questions, please let<br/>
&gt; &gt;me know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Changes have been made to instruments.  Please help<br/>
&gt; me by reading and<br/>
&gt; &gt;correcting my errors.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;      First, some basic rules:<br/>
&gt; &gt;      (Common sense stuff, really)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible).  While we<br/>
&gt; do often stray off the<br/>
&gt; &gt;path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the<br/>
&gt; material &quot;of-interest&quot; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are<br/>
&gt; acceptable, because Bards<br/>
&gt; &gt;have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are<br/>
&gt; not.  Discussions of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an<br/>
&gt; attempt not to spoil<br/>
&gt; &gt;someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading,<br/>
&gt; or put spoiler space<br/>
&gt; &gt;(several blank lines) to let people know in<br/>
&gt; advance.<br/>
&gt; &gt;      Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and<br/>
&gt; any person doing so will <br/>
&gt; &gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt;immediately reviewed for warning, removal or<br/>
&gt; banning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;      On a related note, if you notice that your<br/>
&gt; topic is straying from the<br/>
&gt; &gt;original thread, please change the subject header. <br/>
&gt; Example: RE: Mistmoore<br/>
&gt; &gt;Battle Drums becomes: re: Fighting undead as a Bard<br/>
&gt; (was RE: Mistmoore<br/>
&gt; &gt;Battle Drums) For those of you receiving the digest<br/>
&gt; version, if you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;make an attempt to change the subject field to<br/>
&gt; something appropriate, that<br/>
&gt; &gt;would help those of us not digesting our mail<br/>
&gt; better pass it ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same<br/>
&gt; opinion as you do, but please<br/>
&gt; &gt;be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to<br/>
&gt; read through, and then<br/>
&gt; &gt;make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before<br/>
&gt; posting hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt;all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If<br/>
&gt; you simply MUST insult,<br/>
&gt; &gt;badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old<br/>
&gt; list-term for a thread that is<br/>
&gt; &gt;being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when<br/>
&gt; a thread has<br/>
&gt; &gt;degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be<br/>
&gt; valid for this list, or<br/>
&gt; &gt;when the subject matter has become too inflammatory<br/>
&gt; to be discussed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Kabongs generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;5) No Attached Files!  If you wish to share with us<br/>
&gt; your latest picture,<br/>
&gt; &gt;some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please<br/>
&gt; simply include a link within<br/>
&gt; &gt;your email to an appropriate place online.  If you<br/>
&gt; have no access to such,<br/>
&gt; &gt;email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will<br/>
&gt; post it for you, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;follow up to the list with the URL.  Small<br/>
&gt; infractions will probably be<br/>
&gt; &gt;overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our<br/>
&gt; European readers who<br/>
&gt; &gt;have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot;<br/>
&gt; posts to a minimum, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;try not to quote more of the message than necessary<br/>
&gt; (although you should<br/>
&gt; &gt;always make sure that the message you are sending<br/>
&gt; is properly referenced,<br/>
&gt; &gt;so that people reading the messages out of order<br/>
&gt; are not completely<br/>
&gt; &gt;lost.  And try not to abbreviate too much, or use<br/>
&gt; strange &quot;slang&quot; or<br/>
&gt; &gt;incomprehensible euphemisms.  Plain, clear speech<br/>
&gt; is much more effective,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages...  Also, use<br/>
&gt; spoiler headings and/or<br/>
&gt; &gt;spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or<br/>
&gt; weapon details.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Okay, enough rules.  Now for some Frequently Asked<br/>
&gt; Questions!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;DD&quot;, &quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;MM&quot;, &quot;GZ&quot; -<br/>
&gt; &gt;What do they all mean?!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the<br/>
&gt; EverQuest Glossary at<br/>
&gt; &gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm</a><br/>
&gt; (shameless plug).  Briefly,<br/>
&gt; &gt;those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to<br/>
&gt; spells/effects that do<br/>
&gt; &gt;damage every few seconds for a while, instead of<br/>
&gt; all at once), &quot;Direct<br/>
&gt; &gt;Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their<br/>
&gt; damage at once),<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon,  &quot;MM&quot; is<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore, a<br/>
&gt; &gt;mid-to-high level zone near Lesser Faydark, and GZ<br/>
&gt; is Geoffrey Zatkin, the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Verant Designer in charge of spell balance (and<br/>
&gt; thus a frequently consulted<br/>
&gt; &gt;individual when it comes to our songs....)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What is &quot;twisting&quot; (or &quot;weaving,&quot; &quot;stacking,&quot; or<br/>
&gt; &quot;harmonizing&quot;), and how<br/>
&gt; &gt;do I do it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: &quot;Twisting&quot; is the most common name (although<br/>
&gt; much deprecated by those in<br/>
&gt; &gt;favour of more &quot;period&quot; terms) for singing multiple<br/>
&gt; songs at once - or at<br/>
&gt; &gt;least making it seem that way.  The short<br/>
&gt; explanation is to stop one song<br/>
&gt; &gt;and immediately start another one, repeat as<br/>
&gt; necessary.  Since most song<br/>
&gt; &gt;effects have a duration of about 6 seconds, you<br/>
&gt; have time to weave as many<br/>
&gt; &gt;as three (and I&#39;ve even heard tell of four!) songs<br/>
&gt; at once before the first<br/>
&gt; &gt;wears off, gaining the effects from all of them at<br/>
&gt; once.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The long explanation, complete with illustrations,<br/>
&gt; can be found here:<br/>

&gt; &gt;     (thanks Tork@Nameless).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level?  What does<br/>
&gt; this song do?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest<br/>
&gt; Bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;Guild <br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)</a> has a<br/>
&gt; list of<br/>
&gt; &gt;spellsongs, however, most people seem to prefer<br/>
&gt; detailed statistics, so let<br/>
&gt; &gt;me refer you to<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/index.html">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/index.html</a> (The Bardic<br/>
&gt; Song<br/>
&gt; &gt;Analysis page), compiled by Rokenn Swiftsong. <br/>
&gt; Also, the Soerbaird is a<br/>
&gt; &gt;wonderful site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com/">http://www.soerbaird.com/</a><br/>
&gt; &gt;(Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What do instruments do?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Some songs have associated instruments.  Playing<br/>
&gt; this instrument will<br/>
&gt; &gt;generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but<br/>
&gt; this is also related<br/>
&gt; &gt;to  your relative skill with the instrument.  Also,<br/>
&gt; instrument skill is<br/>
&gt; &gt;partially responsible for failure rate of related<br/>
&gt; songs.  To avoid missing<br/>
&gt; &gt;notes, even when singing, keep your instrument<br/>
&gt; skills maxed out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments<br/>
&gt; for Bards?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot;<br/>
&gt; instruments in the world.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found in<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore), which increases <br/>
