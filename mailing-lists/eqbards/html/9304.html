&gt; On a monk board I have been reading lately (started playing my monk again) I<br/>
&gt; found a link to an interesting discussion on the benefits (or lack there of)<br/>
&gt; of stat buffs.  The Shaman that ran the test came to the conclusion that<br/>
&gt; that buffing Str had a negative impact on damage. Here is a link to the<br/>
&gt; thread:<br/>

&gt; I would love to read John&#39;s comments on this :)<br/>

BTW, I really dislike that John Kim has usurped the name John here.   :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, speaking as someone who does this sort of testing professionally, I can tell you that<br/>
this person did a lot of work into the test, but personally, I wouldn&#39;t take the results to the<br/>
bank.<br/>
<br/>
The main reason is that he just didn&#39;t have a big enough sample size, in my opinion.  His<br/>
smallest test case had only 71 attempted hits, and of those, only 55% hit.   That combined with<br/>
the variability of the possible results (1 damage to 39 damage) makes it quite possible for<br/>
random variation to infuence the results more than they should.<br/>
<br/>
For example: We all know that the numeric mean of rolling a six sided die is 3.5.  If you rolled<br/>
a 6 sided die an infinite number of times, assuming the die is perfectly balanced, you should get<br/>
a mean of 3.5 -- but you don&#39;t need to do it that many times.  The way randomness works means<br/>
that you can roll it a lesser number of times, and depending on how many times you roll that die,<br/>
be PRETTY sure that the result you get will accurately reflect the true result.  That&#39;s what<br/>
statistics and probabability is all about.<br/>
<br/>
Now, using the 6 sided die, if you rolled it 71 times, would you get 3.5 as the mean?  I&#39;d guess<br/>
probably.  71 times is a lot of rolls when there are only 6 possible results.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you roll it 71 times and it&#39;s a 40 sided die, do you think you&#39;d get the<br/>
true mean of 20.5?   Maybe.... but I&#39;d expect a result something in the neighbourhood of 18-24.<br/>
That&#39;s the effect of variability.  And this test didn&#39;t even get 71 hits, he got 39.  Do you<br/>
think you could roll a 40 sided die and get an accurate reading of the average roll with 39<br/>
tries?  Try rolling a six sided die 5 times and seeing if you get an average of 3.5.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve taken a lot of stats courses, you&#39;ll know what I mean by the concept of &quot;power&quot;.  Power<br/>
determines the size of sample you&#39;ll need to get within a certain allowable variability.  I could<br/>
whip out my stats book and figure out the power needed to get an acceptable result for this<br/>
test... but to be honest, I hate stats, so I&#39;ll wimp out.  :)<br/>
<br/>
These tests MAY be valid, but given the weird results, I would take them with a grain of salt.<br/>
The person may be on to something here, I won&#39;t deny it, but I&#39;d like to see the test repeated<br/>
and compare the results.<br/>
