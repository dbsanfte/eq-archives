&gt; Clerics are almost our<br/>

that a wizard was just as good in melee.<br/>

&gt; using charm).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why not use charm?  Or why not kite it instead.  Root and shoot is just like<br/>
kiting, except more dangerous.  And low 30s Clerics are an aberation.  They<br/>
get Wraith at 29 but not another DD spell until 44.  Wait until the lvl 31<br/>
cleric is lvl 40 using that same Wrath spell and they can&#39;t solo anything.<br/>

more they drop off.<br/>
<br/>
Why does the Cleric have a better AC than you?  You both can wear the same<br/>
armor.  You should have very similar AC, unless the Cleric has been tweaked<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
What magical weapon is the Cleric using?  The only Cleric-only weapon would<br/>
be his summoned Hammer (6/32).  A bard of your level could be using a<br/>
Combine LongSword (6/28) or even a Dirk.  Either of these weapons are better<br/>
than the hammer.<br/>
