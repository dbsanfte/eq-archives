<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333744562">Now head on over to the bank in Freeport.  Open the door and go back by the<br/>
bankers.  There is another door back there that is locked.  When I tried to<br/>
open it with my Gnomish lockpicks, it said that I lacked the skill to open<br/>
this door.  But then again, I doubt that my pick skill is maxxed.<br/>

that locked door.  And yes, he was on the inside and could not get out!!<br/>
/petition Help!  I am trapped in this room and cant get out!<br/>

&gt; After attaining level 40 I decided to take my lock picks and head to<br/>
&gt; Befallen so I could max out my final skill on the doors there.<br/>
