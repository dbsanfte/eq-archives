<div id="ygrps-yiv-696104854">No its not that I want to complain that now they can chain cast buffs.  I&#39;m<br/>
more irritated in that I think there are things far more &#39;broken&#39; for other<br/>
classes and that they should spend their time on finding way to tweak the<br/>
non-purecasting classes to make them better as they are already behind.  Why<br/>
on earth would Necros need any enhancement whatsoever at this point???<br/>

I don&#39;t think this is worth us griping about.  (maybe because I play my<br/>
cleric and not my bard now).<br/>
<br/>
Does it really hurt us now that bufferes can chain cast their buffs?  It<br/>
was merely an annoyance  that you had to wait a few seconds for some<br/>
buffs to recycle.  I have no idea their system for cast time/recycle<br/>
time on buffs, its seems totally random and thrown together (that would<br/>
be a shocke eh?)<br/>
<br/>
Examples:  From lvl 9 to 19 cleric buffs are Holy Armor (lvl 4) and<br/>
Center.  At 19 you get Spirit Armor and Daring.  Center has a medium<br/>
recycle time and longer cast time then Holy armor.  However, Spirit<br/>
Armor has a REALLY long cast and recycle time, yet daring is short in<br/>
both cases.  I guess I fail to see the need to limit the power of spirit<br/>
armor (gives 12 ac)...  <br/>
