<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023568148">I finally made the trek to Erudin to get Shield of Songs.  Now I&#39;m trying to<br/>
figure out if its better to use this song or Nivs in order to reduce<br/>
downtime due to lost health.  SoS gives a 48pt runeshield against melee<br/>
attacks with lute equipped.  Nivs heals 12 pts of damage with lute equipped<br/>
plus gives a 20 pt runeshield against magic attacks.  The extra STR from<br/>
Nivs doesn&#39;t really affect downtime so I don&#39;t consider that a factor when<br/>
deciding between the two songs.  Against melee-only mobs, SoS appears to be<br/>
the best choice while Niv&#39;s is better against caster mobs.  So far I have<br/>
primarily used these songs when there is no cleric in the group and the<br/>
druid/shaman needs some help keeping everyone alive.  Would like to hear how<br/>
everyone else uses these two songs.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
