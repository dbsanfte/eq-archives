 </span></blockquote>Yup, off the same named gypsy.  A L37 bard was in Mistmoore<br/>
last night offering to trade an Ebony Blade for the drum.  I&#39;m<br/>
kicking myself for not offering to buy it from my friend (and<br/>
he&#39;s probably kicking himself for not holding onto it for a<br/>
while since he&#39;s a ranger and could&#39;ve used that Ebony Blade).  <br/>
Oh well, I&#39;ve alerted all my friends and they&#39;re on the<br/>
lookout for it for me now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to know there are special bard &quot;weapons&quot; in the<br/>
game.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Why do I get the feeling Mistmoore is going to be camped by<br/>
bards this weekend...<br/>
