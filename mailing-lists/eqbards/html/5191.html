  I&#39;m beginning to think that just perhaps it IS server related.  On the<br/>
test server last night I was having the usual (read &quot;WAY too many&quot;) number<br/>
of missed notes.  Later on, on Bristlebane, however, things seemed pretty<br/>
peachy.  I&#39;d call it 5% based on about 2 hours of hunting in Crushbone.<br/>
Here are the semi-detailed stats:<br/>
Talies on Test Server: Level 7, weaving Chant, Hymn and Chords - 15-20%<br/>
miss ratio.<br/>
Talies on Bristlebane: Level 15, weaving Anthem, Hymn and Lullaby - 5% miss<br/>
ratio.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll start collecting more official data tonight.<br/>
