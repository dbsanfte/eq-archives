<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145786525">From Freeport head out into the East Commonlands.  Put your Accelerando<br/>
on, and take the trail into the woods.  When the trail splits, go left. <br/>
This will take you by several inns, and you&#39;ll be in sight of the desert<br/>
at times...keep an eye on those Griffins!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll zone to West Commonlands - this is the dangerous part.  Not only<br/>
Griffs and Hill Giants, but Young Kods, and real Kods to chase you. <br/>
Keep Accelerando on and split the middle of the zone - the road is too<br/>
dangerous (there&#39;s a Dark Elf necro named Kizdean Gixx that hangs on the<br/>
road with a pet - he&#39;s still red to me at 12th), and you are safe as<br/>
long as you keep running.  At the other end of the zone you will rejoin<br/>
the road as you zone into Kithicor Forest.<br/>
<br/>
In Kithicor slow down a bit.  Stick to the road, always take the right<br/>
fork in the road.  The last fork is a doozy - bends back on itself right<br/>
next to a tree - easy to miss.  If you zone to High Hold, you&#39;ve gone<br/>
too far, come back out to Kithicor, staying along the left side of the<br/>
zone and you can&#39;t miss the entrance to...<br/>
<br/>
RIVERVALE!!!  Home of Happiness (or at least where the idea for<br/>
McDonalds McBurglar came from).  Explore, there are plenty of quests<br/>
here, mostly Druidical it seems, but the Squad Ring quest is for<br/>
any/everyone.  Misty Thicket is through the cave that the Priest of<br/>
Discord faces.<br/>
<br/>
A note on the Squad Ring itself:  Yes, it takes a pile of Goblins...was<br/>
about 200 - 250, plus around 40 Mootos for me.  The occasional stray orc<br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt.  I accidentally killed Gunrich once, the word is thats bad<br/>
for your faction adjustment.  Keep those necklaces and don&#39;t give up.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my wife&#39;s Druid heard about the good time I was having in<br/>
Misty/Rivervale and decided to come over.  She dug in with the quests<br/>
around town, and then headed over to Misty Thicket.  She got her squad<br/>
ring much faster than I, or anyone else I&#39;ve talked to.  We&#39;ve narrowed<br/>
it down to two possibilities:  either a) you do enough good works around<br/>
Rivervale that you don&#39;t need to kill so many goblins, or b) the sheer<br/>
numbers of Orcs she killed over in the Faydark from levels 5 - 10 before<br/>
coming somehow counted.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy the Misty Thicket!!!<br/>
