 </span></blockquote>Actually, much younger, I&#39;d say 5 - 80. =) I know at least three people &lt;<br/>
12 who play. They generally seem a lot more mature than many players I<br/>
meet too, mostly because they know when to keep their mouths shut. =)<br/>
<br/>
Those 3 are three children of an entire family that plays EQ. Mother,<br/>
father, daughter and two sons. Crazy! =) <br/>
<br/>
The family the kills together, stays together?</div>
