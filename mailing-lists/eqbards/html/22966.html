Subject: [eqbards] Selos breaking root was not a bug<br/>
<br/>
This is not the first time there has been an issue with Selos breaking root.<br/>
<br/>
For all of you old-timers, do you remember back in spring/summer of 1999<br/>
when a patch went in that made it where Selos would not break root?  The<br/>
patch went in, there was a public outcry, and a few days later the decision<br/>
was reversed and Selos was working the way it did when the game was first<br/>
released, i.e. it broke root. Geoffrey Zatkin at one point even publically<br/>
stated that Selos breaking root was &quot;working as intended&quot; and not a bug.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else remember that far back?  I&#39;d also like to know where we can<br/>
find GZ&#39;s statement (if it is still archived somewhere).<br/>
<br/>
BTW who wants to bet with me that the reason Selos got nerfed (not referring<br/>
to the drum bug) is because Verant discovered uberguilds were using bards to<br/>
safely pull in the PoG?<br/>
