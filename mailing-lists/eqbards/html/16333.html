that particular area.  And they have.<br/>

&gt; I initially thought this as well, but the post that I sent out earlier<br/>
&gt; showed that Gordon was not planning on changing policy on servers like<br/>
&gt; Prexus.  On Prexus if you want into the Kings room and there is another<br/>
&gt; group in there already, you can request to be added to that groups waiting<br/>
&gt; list.  Whenever a member of that group leaves, the next person of the<br/>
&gt; appropriate class on the waiting list gets the call to come and join the<br/>
&gt; hunt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gordon seemed to me to make it clear that this was a fully acceptable way to<br/>
&gt; deal with the other group that wanted to camp the same spot and the<br/>
&gt; GMs/Guides would not force the group in there to split the spawn.  If this<br/>
&gt; is truely a reality, this policy should barely touch life on Prexus<br/>
&gt; generally every single camp there is works on the &quot;list&quot; principle anyhow... </span></blockquote></div>
