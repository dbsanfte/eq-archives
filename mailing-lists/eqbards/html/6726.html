<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680345206">You could do that except the factions on guards and merchants are usually<br/>
different factions and sometimes conflicting so making one happy does not<br/>
necessarily make you safe from the other simultaneously.  The main problem<br/>
is that our carillon song is not good enough to convert a KOS enemy to a non<br/>
KOS enemy.  Mainly it seems to exist for the purpose of gaining faction for<br/>
better buying/selling prices and obtaining/completing more quests.<br/>

&gt; So based on what you are saying, I could go into Feerot, <br/>
&gt; target an ogre<br/>
&gt; guard (bouncer),  sing the carillion and make it to where I&#39;m not KOS<br/>
&gt; anymore, and then merrily waltz around the zone with no worry of ever<br/>
&gt; getting attacked by any ogre guards.   <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;IIRC, it only works on one target and wears off very quickly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It only works on one target but appears to last on all <br/>
&gt; members of that<br/>
&gt; &gt; NPCs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;type&quot; until you zone. make one shopkeeper happy and all of <br/>
&gt; that &quot;type&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; which may vary. Make a guard happy and the shopkeepers <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like you<br/>
&gt; &gt; again...just a typical day in Highpass Hold/High Keep for me!<br/>
