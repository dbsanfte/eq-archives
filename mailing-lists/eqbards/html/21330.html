<br/>
There is a bard thread that Abashi has started (and if you haven&#39;t heard of<br/>
it yet, shame on you for not keeping up on your EQ studies ;p) on the<br/>
Gameplay forum.   Currently, it&#39;s into it&#39;s 10th page, over 350 posts (and<br/>
growing), and has yet to leave the 1st page of the forum..  Please support<br/>
the bardic community by posting there (not looking for bumps or flames, but<br/>
more discussion).<br/>
<br/>
Also, check out the latest Daily Screenshot at EQVault featuring Yours Truly<br/>
;o)  (Thanks again to Chillsy over at the Concert Hall boards for the sign).<br/>
