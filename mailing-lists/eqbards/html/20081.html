<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573397909"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;It&#39;s just that I have basically given up on grouping with <br/>
&gt; the enchanters.<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s nothing but a big headache.  There&#39;s really not a whole <br/>
&gt; lot I can do if<br/>
&gt; &gt;my tanking is sub par and I can&#39;t use any songs that might <br/>
&gt; awaken his mezzed<br/>
&gt; &gt;mobs.  So long as I can find a group that doesn&#39;t have <br/>
&gt; enchanters in it I<br/>
&gt; &gt;can do very well.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to find a group <br/>
&gt; without one and<br/>
&gt; &gt;that&#39;s when the suggestions begin.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have been Certified Enchanter Friendly by the Enchanters Guild and that is<br/>
not an easy certification to get for a bard. Here is what I do at level 35:<br/>
<br/>
Weapons:<br/>
I put away the Blade of Fiery Lamentations and break out the  Staff of<br/>
Writhing, with the Obsidian Shard I am now AE free on weapons and still<br/>
kicking butt.<br/>
<br/>
Songs:<br/>
<br/>
In combat (assuming the Enchanter knows their job and keeps the haste buffs<br/>
coming) I sing Psalm of Cooling, Clarity and Chant of Battle in combat. I<br/>
have Lament ready in case the Enchanter mezzes a large pull, I do this<br/>
because if I don&#39;t and the mezz breaks the mobs are all over him/her. Lament<br/>
gives the enchanter a chance the mobs will agro on me, and I can survive<br/>
that better.<br/>
<br/>
I also have Resist buffs and pixie strike ready for an unplanned caster-mob<br/>
emergency.<br/>
<br/>
If the enchanter gets the casters mezzed I switch to horn and play Dennons<br/>
Dissention to drain them while they wait.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of ways to play nice with an enchanter, frankly I love<br/>
grouping with them. And any other casters love it too, Clarity and Clarity<br/>
song is a beautiful thing.<br/>
<br/>
Tszaaz<br/>
<br/>
(Hymn is the other song of course. There are some changes for outdoor as I<br/>
need selos, however, if there is a Shaman I just get a SoW and use the slot<br/>
for something else)<br/>
