<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039115963">It&#39;s a bit depressing to hear someone toss about unfounded slander like that<br/>
without really thinking about the affects.  Sure, you can say the price is<br/>
excessive, but you outright accused them of being greedy without bothering<br/>
to find out what they do with it.  Maybe you should have suggested some<br/>
other plan instead?  Screaming &quot;bullcrap,&quot; and &quot;greedy rogues&quot; won&#39;t do a<br/>
thing except hurt their image, and really they haven&#39;t done anything wrong.<br/>
If you don&#39;t like it, you don&#39;t have to join.  Once you join, you can always<br/>
leave.<br/>
<br/>
I have personally met Jythri, Ixtlan, and a few other members.  Jythri was<br/>
excellent company, and offered me help immediatly.  Later, when I needed<br/>
help and he wasn&#39;t available, a friend of his was more than willing to help<br/>
me.  Ixtlan, a level 7 bard at the time I believe, took me from Freeport to<br/>
Halas without charge.  He intended to just come back afterwords too.  That<br/>
has to be a two hour trip, even with accelerando.  That is what Jythri was<br/>
talking about.  Shirt off his back!  I can assure you, all other members of<br/>
the Soerbaird that I met were just as nice.<br/>
<br/>
No, I am NOT a Soerbaird member, or am I associated with them in any way,<br/>
excluding my admiration to their fine group.<br/>
<br/>
I am proud to know the Soerbaird are out there to lend a helping hand.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt;I appreciate your concern, and I know that ten platinum is a hefty sum.<br/>
&gt;But, as I responded to you privately, the funds are not misused nor are<br/>
&gt;they squandered. Running a guild has its expenses, especially if we are to<br/>
&gt;provide collective services for our bards so that they might carry on their<br/>
&gt;work with honor and dignity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I mentioned to you before, lad, we provide the following services to our<br/>
&gt;members:<br/>
&gt;    * Patchwork armor for all new students<br/>
&gt;    * The first five levels of songs for all new students<br/>
&gt;    * A hand drum at level 5<br/>
&gt;    * A lute at level 8<br/>
&gt;    * Bi-weekly rewards for the best in-guild ballad or writing. This week<br/>
&gt;       it was a Banded mail tunic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, we use the money to pay for other expenses, including:<br/>
&gt;     * Staff for concerts<br/>
&gt;     * Saving for a guild hall<br/>
&gt;     * Prizes for other Soerbaird events<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We do not use guild money for:<br/>
&gt;     * Buying better armor or equipment for guild leadership<br/>
&gt;     * Bribing news sites for better placement<br/>
&gt;     * Paying necromancers to destory anyone who speaks negatively<br/>
&gt;       about The Soerbaird<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For the public record, all of our staff, called Ollave, have more than paid<br/>
&gt;their ten platinum, without a complaint, and most of them continue to<br/>
&gt;contribute into the guild treasury on a daily basis, in order to benefit<br/>
&gt;our students. I have seen several of them give the shirts off of their<br/>
&gt;backs and the weapons from their fists to help a deserved student in need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Doerbaird, before you sally our guild&#39;s reputation again in a public forum,<br/>
&gt;I would respectfully request that you air your differences with me, as I<br/>
&gt;will be happy to hear any problem you have with our guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Listen and Live.<br/>
