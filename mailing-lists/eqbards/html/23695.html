<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955276978">Regarding the Druid changes:<br/>
<br/>
Add in the probability that they&#39;re going to nerf the Complete Heal spell (without adequately balancing<br/>
the MOBs to compensate), and you can kiss those Clerics goodbye.  Sure, give great stuff to the easiest,<br/>
fastest-leveling, most widely played class in the game and nerf one of the most one-dimensional boring<br/>
classes to make them overlap even more than they do.  That sure balances things.<br/>
