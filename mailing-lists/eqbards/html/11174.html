<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last nite my husband was playing on his computer and the higher bard in our<br/>
guild asked him, &quot;where&#39;s bran?&quot;. My hubby told me they were in Oasis<br/>
pulling DWGobs and if I could get there, they&#39;d let me loot a helm. I<br/>
practically ran to my computer and logged on immed (I was straightening up<br/>
the living room - but there&#39;s no choice - EQ or clean up the living room...<br/>
hehehe). I had logged out just inside the HGuk zone to Innothule, so I left<br/>
Guk and headed to Oasis. When I got there, they had me group up with the 50<br/>
L druid in our guild to help him heal while he and the others pulled and<br/>
fought Gobs one at a time. They&#39;re comments to me were, &quot;just keep happy<br/>
feet up, sis.... in case things get bad.&quot; Just for kicks I bellowed at one<br/>
of the gobs twice and, of course, he resisted (He didn&#39;t even look at me, in<br/>
fact, I bet the Gob just thought, &quot;what is that teeny bug scratching my<br/>
neck?&quot;.....just wanted to see what would happen)... so I switched back to<br/>
weaving the happy feet and healing. Not too long after getting there, they<br/>
killed one with the helm (our higher level bard had already looted one) and<br/>
let me loot it! YAY! This is my first piece of anything for the lambent!!<br/>
<br/>
I am SO excited - I don&#39;t care if people who are under 20 are buying their<br/>
lambent (the other day I saw a level 16 bard who bought her whole set of<br/>
lambent and she didn&#39;t seem to care that much about it... it wasn&#39;t that big<br/>
a deal to her... however, when I told her that I am L22, and was going to<br/>
attain the lambent myself rather than buy it, her comments were &quot;Wow! L22&quot; -<br/>
she was more amazed about my level than anything lambent) - its so much more<br/>
fun to go get the quest components myself or at least assist in getting<br/>
them - even if all I do is heal and be ready to run!!<br/>
<br/>
Safe Journeys!<br/>
