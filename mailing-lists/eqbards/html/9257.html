<b>Subject:</b> Re: level 32 and not sure! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-891078238">At the insistence of my higher-level friends, who want me to get Level 32 as fast <br/>
as possible, I&#39;ve been hanging around High Keep for several levels now.  Two <br/>
points of advice:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Don&#39;t bother to show up in prime time (7pm-1am EST); you will almost certainly <br/>
have to go on a waiting list to get into either room (warrior/raider), and it can <br/>
take several hours for your number to be called (and, trust me, people wait that <br/>
long).  Plus, the Keep is so crowded at that point that all of the spawns outside <br/>
the rooms will be camped, so you will be in a party of six with very few spawn <br/>
points under your control.<br/>
<br/>
2.  At your level, you would prefer the raider room.<br/>
<br/>
The two advantages of HK are:  steady exp, and almost no chance of death (provided <br/>
you space the spawns out a bit).  I&#39;ve died a whopping two times in six levels, <br/>
once when I was bored and went out soloing, and once when the raider room dumped <br/>
their entire room spawn on my head.<br/>
<br/>
The keep is very small.  Go down the stairs to the bank, turn left, go down the <br/>
next two sets of stairs to the first basement room where people are fighting.  <br/>
Nothing there should bother you.  Go left down &quot;the ramp&quot;, the warrior room is on <br/>
the right, the raider room is further down the hall.  That&#39;s it.  Keep Selo&#39;s <br/>
going in case you get whacked and by some fluke a room is not camped.  There are <br/>
guards upstairs who will follow picklaws down into the fighting area if someone <br/>
lets them run, so AE songs are not totally safe (but I use them anyway).  <br/>
Chain/Fear works swell, btw.  Just be ready to run if a guard starts hitting you <br/>
(know how to get back out).<br/>
<br/>
I would estimate that you can pick up a bubble of exp once every two to three <br/>
hours, depending on the group you&#39;re in (level 30 excepted).<br/>

PS - Be sure to say &quot;Hi&quot; to me if you come by.  I expect to be there until lvl 32, <br/>
then I get dragged off by my level 40 caster buddies.<br/>

&gt; Im level 32 now! Not too sure where to fight or what to kill. If any one has<br/>
&gt; any clue that would be great. To be honest I know of lower guk, but I hate<br/>
&gt; that place with a passion!!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was told that High hold keep would be good in the warriors room, fighting<br/>
&gt; pickclaws?  I dont know my way in HHK at all. I am on Innourkk server. Can<br/>
&gt; any one show me the way there or another spot to fight? Or some detailed<br/>
&gt; info :) thanks all........<br/>
