<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574817963">Lol, who cares, either way he didn&#39;t really earn 60.  He &quot;cheated&quot; to get<br/>
it.  Not cheated as in broke any rules but definitely cheated the system to<br/>
get ahead of it.  I refuse to congratulate, hold in awe, or respect someone<br/>
that finds pleasure in cheating the system.  And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if<br/>
he didn&#39;t have a RL friend or roomate that helped him keep the character at<br/>
it for longer than normal periods of time.  Just because other people<br/>
weren&#39;t logging into the account doesn&#39;t mean that other people weren&#39;t<br/>
playing it ;)<br/>
<br/>
Glad he&#39;s 60.<br/>
<br/>
Hope he enjoys being there.<br/>
<br/>
But... I don&#39;t find it all that surprising.  Nor do I find it something to<br/>
be proud of or to respect someone for.  Heh, everyone knows that FoH are a<br/>
pack of powergamers (very very GOOD powergamers).  Not saying this is a BAD<br/>
thing, just that it isn&#39;t my style and that I don&#39;t respect someone for how<br/>
fast they can hit 60 ;)<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention that he and Furor are total jerks if you ever have to deal<br/>
with them in game ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; That ranger is a character, not a player.  About 5 people played it 24/7<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get it to 60 that fast.  He&#39;s a member of FoH... need I say more?<br/>

&gt; Elderan was not played by multiple people.  It was played by one<br/>
&gt; person with 3 or 4 computers who twinked himself using other accounts.  I<br/>
&gt; heard Furor (formerly Kalaran, first level 50 on any server, in case you<br/>
&gt; forgot) had people playing him, but really don&#39;t know too much about<br/>
&gt; that situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a LOT of rumors associated with this whole thing.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; heard stories such as &quot;Elderan had 3 groups killing stuff down to a sliver<br/>
&gt; then blurring it, so he was killing stuff with 2 or 3 swings, turning,<br/>
&gt; killing another thing in 2 or 3 swings, and getting solo exp on all of<br/>
&gt; them&quot;.  Hehe.  It&#39;s really kinda funny what people can come up with,<br/>
&gt; especially on something so cheesy.<br/>
