<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099556750">Question for all you Bards who spend a lot of time in Hate...<br/>
<br/>
I think my guild has now logged more hour in the &quot;new&quot; Hate, than any <br/>
other Xegony guild. While this has been good for the guild, I still <br/>
have the same old problem -- what songs to play?<br/>
<br/>
Pretend you are a level 54 bard, and are hunting Hate level 2 with 23 <br/>
other people. Assume all the melee has the enchanter epic haste, and <br/>
each group, generally, contains an enchanter, a cleric, 2 melee, and <br/>
two caster. (Well, your group will have one caster and a bard. <br/>
