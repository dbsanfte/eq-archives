<div id="ygrps-yiv-714549969">How bout just giving us an instrument slot.  Not one where you could USE a<br/>
weapon and instrument at the same time, just some so that we didn&#39;t have to<br/>
physically equip and unequip constantly - just trade off in some type of<br/>
button arrangement - like archers do between their bow and other weapons.<br/>

&gt;easy to fix, make it so you can&#39;t equip a bow and an instrument, logical<br/>
&gt;anyhow<br/>

&gt;4. My biggest dissapointment at becoming a bard in the beginning, went to<br/>
&gt;buy a bow only to find we cannot use them.  I could care less that they are<br/>
&gt;somewhat inefficient, I just wanted to be able to use one.  It fits into<br/>
&gt;almost every concept of a bard in fantasy literature and games, but not in<br/>
&gt;EQ?  Can&#39;t figure out why since it clearly is not unbalancing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually it can be very unbalancing.  You could stand outside of combat,<br/>
&gt;play songs with an instrument and still be able to fire arrows into combat.<br/>
&gt;Last I heard people were capable of doing 20+ dmg per arrow.  The trade off<br/>
&gt;we make for having more effective songs when played is that we&#39;re out of<br/>
&gt;combat and generally not doing direct damage (except of course<br/>
&gt;bellow/discord/etc).  If we could use bows then there&#39;d be no decision to<br/>
&gt;make as to sing or play songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Funny thing is 7 is all I canthink of right offhand.  I still think bards<br/>
&gt;are a great class, most of my gripes are little things.  I still hold to my<br/>
&gt;feeling that I will never play another non-binding class however.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d have to concur, which is why I tend to laugh a bit when I see a bard<br/>
&gt;petition being proposed.  There are much larger issues in the game, but<br/>
&gt;still it&#39;s nice to have a concise list of what we see as problem areas.<br/>
