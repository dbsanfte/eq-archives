<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747667844">Every level or so, when I&#39;m stressed out and need some relaxation, I go to North Ro with fishing pole in hand, <br/>
stand by Puntar Sandfisher, and practice Sense Heading, Fishing, Foraging and Begging for awhile, followed by <br/>
a refreshing dip in the ocean to keep Swimming maxed.  My Begging is now in the low 40s, and I consider it a <br/>
lucky day indeed when Puntar hands over even one silver piece among the copper.  I also generally beg from the <br/>
last NPC I encounter in any city zone as I prepare to zone out.  I almost always get copper from them, as <br/>
well.  I always cast Carillon on Puntar.<br/>
<br/>
I have read that Begging at &quot;high levels&quot; can give items; I have also read that Bards get a Begging advantage <br/>
(whether this is simply from charisma/Carillon, or some other Bard-specific advantage was not clear).  My <br/>
question is this:  have any Bards out there been nuts enough to get Begging high enough to tell me whether it <br/>
is worth my while?  Begging has a REALLY slow recycle rate, and (if memory servers) it only improves when <br/>
successful.  Although it&#39;s fun to do in front of other players (who can see the target yell at me and give me <br/>
something, but don&#39;t know what the something is), I would rather not waste more time on the skill if it is as <br/>
useless as I suspect.  Anyone know?<br/>
