<div id="ygrps-yiv-325315113">Well, supposedly no.  However the spdat.eff file did get patched last<br/>
weekend when I logged in.  They can also change some spell effects in the<br/>
database without taking the servers down.  I think this might actually have<br/>
gone in with the last patch and may have either been unintentional, or they<br/>
may be trying it out to see if they see any unbalancing effects from it<br/>
being live before they announce that it is live.  That way if they have to<br/>
change it fewer people will notice.<br/>

Don&#39;t think the server I am on (E&#39;ci) has gone down for the scheduled server<br/>
maintenance Abashi mentioned.  Haven&#39;t noticed any downloaded files either.<br/>
Kitasi and I play on the same server so thats why I was wondering if the<br/>
patch went in unannounced.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>has either your server gone down or have you downloaded any new files?<br/>
<br/>
if not, then it is impossible.<br/>
