 </span></blockquote>Same thing here.  I thought I was taking a lot of damage in<br/>
plate, well I took even MORE damage in mesh.  :-)  The only<br/>
other noticeable difference fighting at 26/77 instead of 68/77<br/>
was that I was definitely dodging a lot more.  I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
have to work harder at upgrading from bronze to steel to cut<br/>
down my weight.<br/>

Still need to compare banded to plate...<br/>
