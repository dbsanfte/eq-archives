<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065565273">Well, in the group I was in today - there was a VERY happy cleric (lvl 22<br/>
if I remember right) in MM. Shieldboy showed up - and she was the only one<br/>
could use it.<br/>
<br/>
We had to tell her 3x - loot your shield.<br/>

&gt;Loot rules should be stated at the beginning and when any new person joins.<br/>
&gt;You can make up your mind whether to abide it or not - up front.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This concept of the person who can personally best use the item having more<br/>
&gt;&quot;rights&quot; to it or even rights to roll for it than other&#39;s prolly developed<br/>
&gt;from regular groups and/or guild groups.  If you are consistently grouped<br/>
&gt;with players, it benefits the group (or guild) to ensure that everyone is as<br/>
&gt;well equipped as possible.  But in pick-up groups, or if you have &quot;guests&quot;<br/>
&gt;(non-guild or non-reg group), then I think (imho) that everyone deserves the<br/>
&gt;right to roll for any loot. It is their compensation for the risk of being<br/>
&gt;in the group.  Now you can modify that rule to everyone can pick any item<br/>
&gt;they want to roll for and once they win a roll they are out of the rolling<br/>
&gt;until everyone has an item.  This allows some choice and you avoid winning<br/>
&gt;something you don&#39;t want. </span></blockquote></div>
