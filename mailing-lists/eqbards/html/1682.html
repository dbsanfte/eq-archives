<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714215332">Check out Mistmoore, Najena, SoldungB for medium bronze.  Sadly, though,<br/>
other than Drelzna in Najena (who drops bronze VERY rarely), you can afford<br/>
real plate or quest for rubicite by the time you can expect to get medium<br/>
bronze in Mistmoore or Nagafen&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
And, the advantage bronze has over banded is minimal, especially when you<br/>
consider the weight difference between medium banded and medium bronze.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s only a few pieces of med. bronze I&#39;d consider wearing over banded,<br/>
boots and gloves, and one of them, the gloves, you can&#39;t get in banded.<br/>
<br/>
And Unrest is such a FUBAR zone, it promotes small race twinking, as the<br/>
amount of small bronze you can pull out of there in an evening, especially<br/>
if you&#39;re a low STR finger waggler and can&#39;t use it anyway, means you&#39;re<br/>
quickly weighed down, and end up just giving the stuff away, or selling dirt<br/>
cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the fact that Bertox had such an imbalanced group of Unrest<br/>
hunters..two druids and a cleric early on, with no tanks in the party that<br/>
could use the bronze, that led to a lot of it being dumped on the market to<br/>
much lower level players.<br/>
<br/>
Then by the time THOSE players could farm for bronze, they already had it,<br/>
and the trickle down continued.<br/>
<br/>
One other factor..every race/class combo that can wear small bronze pays a<br/>
higher exp penalty than humans or half elves..this tends to balance it out<br/>
somewhat, even if it isn&#39;t itentional.<br/>

&gt;First off let me say I am sorry about the post yesterday when I forgot to<br/>
&gt;remove all of the rest of the digest in my reply - I wont let that happen<br/>
&gt;again!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a lvl 22 bard on Bertox and I have begun to notice a severe imbalance<br/>
&gt;between myself and my wood-elf brethren.  Medium sized bronze armor is<br/>
&gt;almost impossible to come by (i myself have NEVER seen any for sale) and<br/>
&gt;small bronze plate armor is relatively easy to get.  Other bards who are<br/>
&gt;able to wear the small bronze plate are much more viable at my level than<br/>
I,<br/>
&gt;simply because they have the ability to absorb more damage than I do with<br/>
my<br/>
&gt;banded mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have a suggestion for this dilemma?  I am currently searching<br/>
&gt;for spots where I can maximize my money making potential so i can pick up<br/>
&gt;some select peices of plate mail, or other lighter magical armors that<br/>
might<br/>
&gt;be for sale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dont get me wrong - I am not whining!  I just would like to find something<br/>
&gt;to up my armor class which has not changed much since 14th level, when you<br/>
&gt;take out the Defense skill increases that you get with each level.<br/>
