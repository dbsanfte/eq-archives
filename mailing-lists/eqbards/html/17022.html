Interesting numbers.  Did you do the timings on your lvl 50 bard singing<br/>
the songs on himself and then the enchanter casting spells on himself?<br/>
What was the original weapon delay?  Not that these numbers aren&#39;t grossly<br/>
apparent, but if you did use the songs/spells on different characters, how<br/>
did you control for intrinsic differences?  Also, I take it these numbers<br/>
were from combat?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just asking how you did the experiment :)  Frankly, I&#39;m not<br/>
convinced that controlling for any of these things would make a<br/>
significant change in the numbers you obtained.  <br/>
<br/>
Given all that, I suppose the question is: should I be nauseated?  I<br/>
wonder if higher level enchanter buffs are even more superior to the lvl<br/>
16 buff.  <br/>
