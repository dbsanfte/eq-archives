&gt; Having gotten my 17th song recently, I can say that I put no <br/>
&gt; points into my<br/>
&gt; dual wield at all, I just tried wielding a Dagger in my off <br/>
&gt; hand and that<br/>
&gt; worked fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The odd part was that my first improve message was to 36, so I wonder<br/>
&gt; if that&#39;s a bug, of if punching brings it up somehow, too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a bug... IIRC the minute you attain 17th (or is it 18th) you immediately<br/>
have 20+ dual wield skill already.  IMO, there is no need to put any points<br/>
into it.<br/>
