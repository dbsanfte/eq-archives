<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322764281">Ummm - while all the above is true - your forgetting - once something gets<br/>
&#39;green enough&#39; - although they MAY be able to hit for 90&#39;s - 100&#39;s even -<br/>
they gotta HIT ya first.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found is that once you get significantly above a mob in levels -<br/>
yeah - they swing - but they miss more than they hit - while at the same<br/>
time - you should be able to deal significantly more damage and take out<br/>
the threat. It&#39;s a bit different with miss, miss, miss, miss, miss 90 than<br/>
90, 90, 90, 90, 90 loading please wait.<br/>
<br/>
If anything - I think bards in particular need better defensive skills - we<br/>
are supposed to be part rogue after all. Higher dodge would help a LOT.<br/>
Anything that helps ya from getting smacked - swings don&#39;t really count if<br/>
they miss.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I think I am missing something- I was helping some guild members with their<br/>
&gt;&gt; quest when i was lvl 33 or 34- we were fighting shadowmen in West<br/>
&gt;&gt; Commons,and they all conned green to me. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Yep, they are around L25.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; How would greenies kill a lvl 50? I only fought them for a couple of<br/>
&gt;&gt; hours and got no xp- didnt care because I was there for moral support<br/>
&gt;&gt; :)- but I didnt realize they were that nasty? Was I just lucky? The rest <br/>
&gt;&gt; of the group I was helping were mid 20&#39;s as I remember.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  You&#39;re L36, so that would mean a L20 ice goblin would be green to <br/>
&gt;  you for example.  If I dumped you into a room with 5 &#39;green&#39; ice<br/>
&gt;  goblins, you&#39;ve got what? 850 hp?  L20 ice goblins hit for 44ish<br/>
&gt;  dmg and double attack, thats around 8 toe to toe rounds before you&#39;d<br/>
&gt;  be killed at best case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Trust me, it gets worse.  L35/L36 mobs are &#39;green&#39; to a L50.<br/>
&gt;  Hill giants are green to me.  So are spectres.  Grimfeather <br/>
&gt;  is just barely blue.  All of these monsters can kill a L50<br/>
&gt;  melee player toe to toe in no time at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  So now you are a L50 paladin who has killed Shadowmen for sport<br/>
&gt;  and you roll through one of their camps and pick up 5 shadowmen<br/>
&gt;  (1 cleric, 2 wizards, and 3 warriors).  These L25 npcs move faster<br/>
&gt;  than you do, can melee for 50ish damage, can cast for 150ish dmg,<br/>
&gt;  and you&#39;ve got 1500 hp.  You cannot outrun them, you could turn <br/>
&gt;  to fight, but then what - die like a man?  ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Once you get L40, most clops will be green to you, that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  mean you are gonna whup their ass ;p<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Verant really messed up the consideration/exp scale.  If something<br/>
&gt;  can almost kill me, then I better damn get some experience from<br/>
&gt;  it.  A L50 wizard can solo two hill giants at the same time with<br/>
&gt;  root and ice comet.  A L50 shaman/mage/necro can too with their<br/>
&gt;  pet.  It&#39;s easy for those people.  A warrior will never solo a<br/>
&gt;  hill giant, neither will a ranger, rogue, paladin.  Sure I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;  seen rangers bow kiting giants... and I think /yawn that&#39;s gonna<br/>
&gt;  take 15 mins.  We can do it with charm, but there is still lots <br/>
&gt;  of risk involved.  It&#39;s not like you have a little snowflake button<br/>
&gt;  on your screen that does 1110 dmg.  Or a pet that can outmelee<br/>
&gt;  tanks of similar level.  To those classes those npcs should be<br/>
&gt;  green.  To other classes they should be blue (formidable, not<br/>
&gt;  you might win, because you will never win if you are one of the<br/>
&gt;  common tanks).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  5 shadowmen won&#39;t kill you as fast as one Solusek Kobold King<br/>
&gt;  or ghoul lord, but they&#39;ll still kill you all the same ;)<br/>
