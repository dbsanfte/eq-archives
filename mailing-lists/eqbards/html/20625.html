<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591388283">Sunday Night (Australia) I was hunting with a group in Frontier Mountains<br/>
when a shout came up about some ac 16 arm items that dropped.  The loc was<br/>
given and off I ran.  Needless to say along the way I died *grin*<br/>
<br/>
In trying to fetch my corpse I almost cried.  The power was flickering a bit<br/>
and kept disconnecting the modem.  *sigh*  But I made it- I got my corpse.<br/>
And visited over there a few times with the natives of Frontier Mountain<br/>
close behind.<br/>
<br/>
A bit later a shout came up that the sleeves would drop again.  Ok attempt<br/>
two.  I could not go much worse I thought.  Then all of the sudden there was<br/>
the corpse at my feet at the Giant Fort.  And the sleeves were mine.  Seems<br/>
the local druid felt bad that I died the first time and made sure I could<br/>
get the sleeves again.<br/>
<br/>
I am now the proud owner of a pair of the Sleeves of the Ancients :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yea :) And I made 28 Sunday and am merrily on my way to 29.  I love those<br/>
giants :)  Slow exp but I am starting to make money again!<br/>
