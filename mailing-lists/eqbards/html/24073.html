&gt;rhetorical debate; or perhaps the comment that people are exaggerating too<br/>
&gt;much.  Keep in mind that  - like analogies exaggerating the opposite of what<br/>
&gt;you are arguing is also a rhetorical device.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with you Slyde. The conversations seemed to me to be getting <br/>
convoluted and losing their coherence. But since you&#39;ve summarized the <br/>
basic gist of the arguments, I&#39;m chiming in with a few quick comments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t mean this as a flame to Whee, (by singling him out); but the<br/>
&gt;argument (if I&#39;m not following it correctly I apologize in advance) seems to<br/>
&gt;be that the thread is Whee one side and everyone else (who participating in<br/>
&gt;the thread) on the other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) DDD - are you saying that this IS a useful song?  That 99 pct of the<br/>
&gt;Bards are wrong - that it is VERY useful; or simply that it is very slightly<br/>
&gt;useful and we are &quot;ridiculously exaggerating&quot; by saying something is<br/>
&gt;&quot;completely&quot; useless instead of &quot;very marginally&quot; useless.  Not MUCH of an<br/>
&gt;exaggeration there if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have preferred that this song were put on a timer much like the <br/>
Divine Aura spell for Clerics, instead of using our mana. Then again, at <br/>
least we can unmemorize this song while waiting for our mana to recover and <br/>
when we&#39;ve got enough mana, just rememorize it. The cleric has to keep 1 <br/>
slot inactive waiting for this to recover (though DA does come back pretty <br/>
fast).<br/>
<br/>
If I had an extra spell slot I&#39;d have DDD loaded just because it&#39;s a nice <br/>
finishing blow. Who wouldn&#39;t like the extra damage that this supplies? <br/>
Unfortunately, at the cost of a song slot, it&#39;s way too costly. I have many <br/>
other songs in my general repertoire that provide much better utility than <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
However, almost each bard song has it&#39;s place, and in a particular <br/>
situation this song could be useful. If I had the extra slot, and I knew <br/>
that charm wasn&#39;t going to be useful, I&#39;d memorize it for the one shot use, <br/>
use it, then put something else in this slot until I recovered my mana.<br/>
<br/>
I pretty much fall in line with the majority here, that this song is <br/>
marginally useful in limited circumstances. If someone finds a reason to <br/>
use this more frequently, I&#39;m sure we&#39;d love to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) The PvP thing was argued a bit - but someone pointed out how Verant has<br/>
&gt;made it very clear they claim they are specifically tuning this song to<br/>
&gt;balance bards across the board.  There has been no indication that this is a<br/>
&gt;PVP.  While it could be a &quot;stealth component&quot; of the tuning a) I doubt it<br/>
&gt;and b) it&#39;s not taking the issue at face value especially considering the<br/>
&gt;whole &quot;Class Balance&quot; threads<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t play PvP so I don&#39;t have much interest in this particular argument. <br/>
 From my casual perusal this conversation fell into a quibbling about <br/>
statistics and that there was a lot of back and forth. I think it was <br/>
summarized well at one time, but then kept going in a rhetorical argument.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3) Bards are over powered.  You haven&#39;t really spent much time arguing<br/>
&gt;that - and I&#39;m not quite clear on your argument for that.   Perhaps it is<br/>
&gt;due to soloing ability.  I despise soloing and never do it.  Personally - if<br/>
&gt;you were to judge EQ as a solo game; it is VERY poor.  Any single-player RPG<br/>
&gt;game rings around EQ as a single-player game.  If I felt like single-player<br/>
&gt;gaming I&#39;d play BG2.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This fell down to arguing about each other&#39;s perceptions of a bard. I think <br/>
at this point you state your opinion and back it up. If it&#39;s a strong <br/>
argument, it should stand up on it&#39;s own, with some back and forth on <br/>
smaller issues.<br/>
<br/>
My quick opinion on this, bards are lot of fun and very challenging to play <br/>
in the long run. A bard&#39;s role continually changes depending on the group <br/>
composition as well as with each level you gain. The strength of a bard is <br/>
generally it&#39;s versatility. But the expense of that versatility is that you <br/>
must continually readjust your tactics. I think we all agree that at higher <br/>
levels we don&#39;t like being asked to play just one song (I don&#39;t need to <br/>
mention what that song is).<br/>
<br/>
Now whether a bard is *the* best or not or whether they can only be played <br/>
by an &quot;elite&quot; group matters not a whit to me.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy playing him and that&#39;s all that really matters to me. I know a lot <br/>
of people have been dissatisfied with Verant and their handling of bards, <br/>
and perhaps because I play casually (which to me means only at most 2 hours <br/>
at a time) and have levelled slowly, I haven&#39;t been caught up in the nerfs <br/>
that have infuriated the more dedicated players. I definitely owe the <br/>
dedicated players many thanks for smoothing out the road for all of us who <br/>
came later.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;A lot of the argument was spent on time arguing percentages - but that was<br/>
&gt;pretty much arguing 1+2 I guess...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The thread kind of reminds me of the Monty Python Argument sketch - the<br/>
&gt;argument SEEMS to be going nowhere just argument for arguments sake (that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;an exaggeration too by the way)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again - I don&#39;t mean this as a flame - or even negative in any way - I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;just intellectually both intrigued and very confused at the same time as to<br/>
&gt;what is REALLY being argued. </span></blockquote></div>
