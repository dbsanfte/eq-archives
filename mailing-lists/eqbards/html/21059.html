<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592158208">check the email address in your reply.  I had problems with that for about<br/>
two weeks, then it changed overnight and started working again.  Until it<br/>
fixed itself I had to paste in the email address on all my replies as it<br/>
wasn&#39;t being picked up correctly.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Egroups problem<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason- my new posts make it through - but replies don&#39;t.  They<br/>
don&#39;t bounce - just never make it to the list.  I recently changed email<br/>
addresses and updated it through their web page (the problem cropped up at<br/>
that time).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
