<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290525580"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ll save the surprise of the lake for you... swim along the bottom,<br/>
&gt; though... heheh.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I entered the lake (west commons) just enough to where I could see to the<br/>
bottom but before it changed the colors to dark (sorta like your head is<br/>
half-way in the water) and I didn&#39;t see anything down there. I did see some<br/>
large piranah&#39;s but that was about it. Am I missing something? It&#39;s awefully<br/>
dark in there and my greater lightstone don&#39;t help much.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyone else jacked up about the plane of FEAR <br/>
&gt; opening tomorrow?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If anyone finds out where the entrance to this is, please post it on the<br/>
list.. I&#39;d like to drop all my items into the bank and run around naked<br/>
there just to look around as well.. Although, if it&#39;s on the island in the<br/>
Oasis, I dont think I&#39;d live long enough to even get through the portal..</div>
