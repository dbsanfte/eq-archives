&gt;  I do seem<br/>
&gt; to remember that some wisps were only yellow to me at 9th, but most were<br/>
&gt; still red.  My record keeping then was pretty sloppy though so I&#39;m not<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I killed about 10 wisps last night in EC and WC. They all conned blue to me<br/>
at 13, about half &quot;risky&quot; and half &quot;upper hand&quot;. So I guess they&#39;re 10-12<br/>
lvl. I took them out easily with Bellow, Hymn and Chords w/ lute (no magic<br/>
weapon yet). I don&#39;t think I would have faired as well strictly using<br/>
Bellow, which leads me to think that a like-level warrior using only magic<br/>
H2H before the change would have a challenge and long downtime.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I know warrior&#39;s don&#39;t get bellow but don&#39;t they have double attack by<br/>
 </span></blockquote>then<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and dual wield?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My first char. when I was learning the game was a barb. warrior. They get<br/>
duel wield at 13 and double attack at 15 if I recall. If a 13 warrior had<br/>
twin combines, wisps would fall quickly, I think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I didn&#39;t have a magic weapon until 13th level<br/>
&gt; and that was a dirk at 25p.  I couldn&#39;t have afforded a combine back then<br/>
&gt; because I was too busy having fun to make money ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OT: After last night I have 60+ pp in the bank. Ready to buy a Dragoon Dirk.<br/>
Where do you recommend I auction? Is 40pp reasonable? Thanks!<br/>
