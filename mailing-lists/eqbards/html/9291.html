&gt; grouped with a 40th bard who was lookign for the mudwater rune. He stated he<br/>
&gt; keeps Lucid lull or Lament armed for spell interuption. Thats the question<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot of people never bothered with Pixie Strike because it&#39;s<br/>
targeted.  That means you either have to be very good at<br/>
switching which mob you&#39;ve targeted, or you keep one mob<br/>
targeted and don&#39;t use your weapons (attack).  I know a lot of<br/>
bards just use Lullaby instead to avoid the targeting hassle.<br/>
