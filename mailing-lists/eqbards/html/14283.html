<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978069513">I also started with this list in the beginning.  I also am tired of the complaints.  But there I must ask to disagree.  This is not a failing on our part this is a failing on Verant&#39;s part and continues to be.  Verant hasn&#39;t fixed much of anything for bards... or atleast anything they didn&#39;t break in the first place and that in an of itself is the problem.  Most of the complaints here are not and have not been &quot;hey they gave druids super teleport powers thats not fair&quot;  It&#39;s things like &quot;Hey wasn&#39;t it a month ago verant promised us an Archmage answers to bard questions&quot;,  &quot;Hey why is it the fix a wizard levitate problem and now we fall down and die if we use the levitate song&quot;  &quot;Hey we can&#39;t surf anymore but we still don&#39;t have a drum after a almost a year of we are going to add it to the next artwork patch&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired frankly of hearing people go shhh be quiet don&#39;t complain or they won<br/>
&#39;t pay attention to real problems.  I&#39;m sorry to point this out but bards more then any other class have been silent it&#39;s only been really the last 2 months that bards have REALLY started to become &quot;whiners&quot; take a look at the site histories for the last year.  Everyone else has had issues addressed, we have not.  Your a programmer,, are you going to tell me if you edited a code that completely disabled another modual in your program and didn&#39;t catch it in testing that your boss wouldn&#39;t be on your neck?  I&#39;m also in technology and I assure you if I did what Verant&#39;s programing staff has been doing I&#39;ld be on the street LONG ago.<br/>

Your right it is a game and it is a fun one.  Of course the problem is the closer to greatness you are the more glaring your faults.  The more you ignore them the more obvious they become.  <br/>

&gt; It&#39;s getting to be so sad.  When I read the patch message I was happy.	I<br/>
&gt; actually said &quot;Yes, finally&quot; out loud to myself.  Then I see the number of<br/>
&gt; eqbard emails that are negative and it saddens me.  When did everyone get so<br/>
&gt; into complaining all the time?	Every time Verant fixes something someone<br/>
&gt; else has to complain.  They nerfed this or now this isnt fair to us.  I<br/>
&gt; think everyone should chill.  Verant is made up of PEOPLE.  People arent<br/>
&gt; always perfect and I am sure, from being a programmer myself, that they are<br/>
&gt; trying there damnest to get things right.  Maybe if everyone wouldnt<br/>
&gt; complain about every little nittpicky thing Verant would be more receptive<br/>
&gt; when there is a real problem.  And maybe they would be more willing to ask<br/>
&gt; for our opinions on what should change.  Instead it seems they always have<br/>
&gt; to defend their choices or apologize.  This is a game.	A very fun one at<br/>
&gt; that.  When something goes wrong I live with it.  It&#39;s not going to kill me.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll still be here tomorrow.  I joined this list in the very beginning so<br/>
&gt; that I could learn about upcoming levels and have someone to ask questions<br/>
&gt; to if I needed.  Now I open my folder and delete, delete, delete, delete.<br/>
&gt; Too bad.  Wouldnt it be nice if this were a happier place?<br/>
