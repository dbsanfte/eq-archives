&gt;you don&#39;t have to camp.  just like in the past when a procing weapon made<br/>
&gt;our songs stick, you can click on and off a song as fast as you can like 15<br/>
&gt;or so times to unstick it, it works eventually.<br/>

&gt;luckily i look so much better as a wood elf than dark elf i don&#39;t use my<br/>
&gt;mask too much unless to show i&#39;m in an evil bad mood =P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>thats new to me, thanks for the info. Heh, i only use the mask because<br/>
everybody else in my group does and its just funny to see a full party of<br/>
dark elves trouncing around everywhere. Course the troll and ogre warrior<br/>
in our group love it for size reasons... <br/>
<br/>
but i still havent heard an answer... is the canceling effect of songs like<br/>
levitate/underwater breathing intentional or a bug?<br/>

more but even less damage :()</div>
