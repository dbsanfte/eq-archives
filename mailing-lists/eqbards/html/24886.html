I have yet to get mine even after having a pet run all over those goblins<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Talies - an update<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I decided that since I was still a low-level (sort-of, 11th), I&#39;d <br/>
delete Talies and recreate him.  Why?  Because I wasn&#39;t happy with my <br/>
choice of religions.  In order to be able to visit anywhere, I decided that <br/>
I&#39;d better work without any religion at all.  Now for the fun part - <br/>
regaining my levels, *without* being powerlevelled.  It&#39;s amazing how a <br/>
well-played bard can seem like he&#39;s being power-levelled anyway ;).<br/>
<br/>
In 26 hours of play, I regained all 11 levels, and improved my faction <br/>
enough to be indifferent in Ak&#39;Anon (got to work on that just a wee bit <br/>
more), and in Rivervale to Amiable, probably half-way to warmly.  Still got <br/>
a long way to go to get the squad ring ;)<br/>
<br/>
My question is - just how effective is the Carillon in situations like this?<br/>
<br/>
For those of you interested, I started in Kelethin, had a friend hand me my <br/>
eq back (full-banded armour, plus a lumberjack&#39;s cap, no jewelry, a combine <br/>
long sword, Rukgus&#39;s sticker, and a Shiny Brass Shield that Talies had <br/>
fought for to begin with.  I didn&#39;t want to be &quot;twinked&quot; - I worked for (or <br/>
payed hard-earned cash for) everything I have.  No freebies.<br/>
<br/>
I stayed in the Kelethin newbie area for a while, collecting wolf pelts and <br/>
spider silk to work on tailoring, and bone chips to sell to needy <br/>
necros.  Only died once until level 4, when I went cliff-jumping with a <br/>
crazy druid - just to see what would happen (I died ;).  At level 5, I gave <br/>
up on orc-hunting - either I&#39;d get jumped, and no one would help, or I&#39;d <br/>
have a nice yellow all alone, and someone would steal it.  I headed for the <br/>
(relative) peace of Steamfont.  Stayed there until 8th, when I headed <br/>
across the ocean to Misty Thicket (got bound in Rivervale, after 30 minutes <br/>
of asking...)  Hunted Goblins almost exclusively until 10th, when I started <br/>
mixing in other stuff for experience (and because there were a lot of <br/>
faction hunters out there significantly cutting down on the numbers of <br/>
goblins.)  BTW - Did you know that the Goblin Alchemist REALLY HURTS at <br/>
level 10?  *ouch*.  Fortunately, a 49th level Necro killed <br/>
him.  Unfortunately, for any monks out there, a 9th level Cleric decided to <br/>
take the ribcage and wear it.  *sighs* Some people&#39;s children...<br/>
In the process of gaining 11 levels, I&#39;ve kept all of my combat skills and <br/>
music skills maxed, and worked a little on baking, tailoring and <br/>
smithing.  All told, I&#39;ve made over 125 pp of pure in-the-bank profit (not <br/>
including purchases).  Not a bad haul for one weekend.<br/>
