<div id="ygrps-yiv-123352774"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   I never play clouding when going to live tower, just because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   too hard to keep 5 other people close enough for invis, I just<br/>
&gt;   let the invis casters get to work.  I would do the same with<br/>
&gt;   an Invis to Undead song as well... hardly ever use it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Our invis song is primarily for self use or stationary party<br/>
&gt;   protection from trains.  I don&#39;t mind if Clouding gets an undead<br/>
&gt;   invis component, but do not suggest another song be Invis V Undead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not anymore!  Now that they have increased the radius on it, this song<br/>
ROCKS!  For 2 weeks straight I did nightly comando raids into Paw for the<br/>
Kisch.  Each time, my group of 6 got to the Tesch by using my invisi song,<br/>
killed him and then invisi&#39;ed around to all the other named spawns and<br/>
killed them too.  It worked fantastic.  No worries about someone&#39;s invisi<br/>
dropping at the wrong time and with the see invisi component, this song is<br/>
actually useful now!  Especially in Paw where there isn&#39;t a darn thing in<br/>
the whole place that can see invisi.  The only time we ever had a problem<br/>
keeping all 6 of us within the range of the songs effects were when someone<br/>
fell off the bridge.... and in those cases, we all just jumped off the<br/>
bridge and modified the order in which we took out the spawns that night...<br/>
My guild now looks at this song as one of those definative songs of the bard<br/>
class.  Something that no other class can do... reliable group invisi that<br/>
pretty much is guaranteed to never fail.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d LOVE to have an undead version of this song for places like Lower Guk.<br/>
It would sure as heck make life easier.  As it is now, we all carry around 2<br/>
or 3 shaman potions in case Invisi to undead starts to drop early....<br/>
