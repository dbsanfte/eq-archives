<div id="ygrps-yiv-429990963">Here&#39;s what I posted to the thread this afternoon:<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
I have strongly mixed feelings about the response by GZ. On the one hand, I <br/>
appreciate the by-and-large wonderful job he´┐¢s done on the magic system in <br/>
EQ, and I am grateful that he took the time to answer these questions. On <br/>
the other hand, I feel that several of his responses failed to answer the <br/>
questions posed. The following questions posed by Rokenn were not directly <br/>
addressed in GZ´┐¢s response:<br/>
<br/>
Rokenn´┐¢s original post:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby, I recently tested this song out vs. a level one <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;human warrior. My Bard was level 37 at the time, using the Lute of the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Gypsy Princess and I have charisma of 141. Every round I got the &#39;so and <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;so head nods&#39; message and every nearly every round the test subject was <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;able to attack me (about 1 in 10 rounds he would not).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
As most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are two saving <br/>
throws that happen with an &quot;Enthrall&quot; style effect (such as Kelin´┐¢s Lucid <br/>
Lullaby) hits a creature. The first saving throw is against the target´┐¢s <br/>
Magic Resistance. The second saving throw only happens with high level <br/>
monsters ´┐¢ they get a secondary save based on their level. The reason for <br/>
this is that the Enthrall effect is very, very powerful ´┐¢ it allows a single <br/>
player to remove a creature from combat. This means that a party that could <br/>
handle two &quot;X&quot; level mobs might be able to take three, or even four of them <br/>
on if there is somebody<br/>
around with the Enthrall effect.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MY QUESTION:<br/>
What in your response explains the tests Rokenn mentioned? &quot;The second <br/>
saving throw only happens with high level monsters&quot; does seem to exclude 1st <br/>
level monsters having a second save, doesn´┐¢t it? Because, as Rokenn stated, <br/>
the &quot;A warrior´┐¢s head nods&quot; message was displayed, this indicates that the <br/>
warrior failed the first save. Therefore the 90% resist rate can only be <br/>
explained by the second save, which you claim the first-level warrior should <br/>
not get (by virtue of not being a high-level monster). So what happened?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have a harder time <br/>
being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can take out a single <br/>
opponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much harder, and by high <br/>
levels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a single player to remove one or <br/>
more creatures from combat at high levels is sick level powerful ´┐¢ to the <br/>
point that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MY QUESTION:<br/>
If I am reading this correctly, Kelin´┐¢s Lucid Lullaby was designed so that <br/>
it would be useful for low-level bards, moderately useful for mid-level <br/>
bards, and not useful at all for high-level bards (due to astronomically <br/>
high resists for high-level monsters). Is this the case?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Alenia´┐¢s Disenchanting Melody works as it was intended to ´┐¢ it follows the <br/>
design that we had for it from the beginning. It is particularly useful? <br/>
Depends if your buddy is dying from a nasty DoT. People use Egg Shaped <br/>
Pumice on themselves all the time on the PvP servers. Is the Disenchanting <br/>
Melody as generally useful as Cancel Magic? Not really.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MY QUESTION:<br/>
Granted that most parties buff their members, in your hypothetical example, <br/>
you have a buddy dying from a nasty DoT so you choose to ADM him, stripping <br/>
away his extra hit points/AC/damage shields etc (and your own) until you get <br/>
to the DoT in question. By thus weakening him, didn´┐¢t you just effectively <br/>
cause him to take as much damage over time as he would have from the DoT? <br/>
Let´┐¢s expand this hypothetical example to include a full party ´┐¢ you have <br/>
one guy dying from a DoT, and to prevent his death by DoT you instead <br/>
massively weaken the whole party? Because this song is party- rather than <br/>
target-oriented, the egg-shaped pumice is a poor analogy. Is there any point <br/>
at all to this song?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rokenn´┐¢s original post:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Denon&#39;s Dissension, The instrument portion of this song seems to be <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;broken. In tests I have run using a horn made no difference in mana drain <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;in PvP combat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
This was a very tough song to balance. It takes away mana from other casters <br/>
´┐¢ the virtual lifeblood of 7 of EverQuest´┐¢s 14 classes. The amount taken <br/>
away is nice, but not great. Using a Horn increases the amount of mana <br/>
drained. Again, nice, but not great.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MY QUESTION:<br/>
Disregarding for the moment the issue of whether the amount of mana drained <br/>
is at all appreciable by 36th level when a bard gets this song, which in <br/>
turn determines whether the song has any utility, Rokenn´┐¢s tests revealed <br/>
that using a horn did nothing to increase the amount of mana drained. You <br/>
claim it does ´┐¢ by what means have you tested this? The same means by which <br/>
you tested whether Fufil´┐¢s does more damage when a drum is wielded?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rokenn´┐¢s original post:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;DoT change a while back lowered the damage of our DoT songs but didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;increase the duration, any chance that this could be balanced in some <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;way?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Bards are affected by the Kiting changes just like everybody else. Bard´┐¢s <br/>
kiting creatures will get the disadvantage ´┐¢ in all other cases, the songs <br/>
should work just as before. Minimal combat movement will not lower the <br/>
damage on a DoT or Bard Song.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MY QUESTION:<br/>
In what sense can you say &quot;bards were affected just like everybody else? In <br/>
the kiting patch, the damage done by all DoTs was reduced across the board, <br/>
affecting bards and others equally. In order to tune the reduction, the <br/>
duration of DoTs was increased. Because bards´┐¢ DoT durations were NOT <br/>
increased like every other classes´┐¢, bards were NOT affected like everybody <br/>
else. Granted that we suffered the same reduction in damage as every other <br/>
class, why did we not receive the same increase in duration as other classes <br/>
to compensate?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate that GZ is a busy man, and that he doubtless gets hundreds of <br/>
demands each day to fix this or nerf that. As a result it must be difficult <br/>
for him to spend a great deal of time on any individual message. I certainly <br/>
don´┐¢t intend any of this as a flame or assault on GZ ´┐¢ but I do still crave <br/>
answers to the questions Rokenn posed, and GZ responded without answering <br/>
many of them.<br/>
