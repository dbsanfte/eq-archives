&gt; I, myself, made 35th level last night, which I have learned <br/>
&gt; is the second of<br/>
&gt; at least three &quot;hell levels&quot; where your experience is somehow <br/>
&gt; &quot;watered down&quot;<br/>
&gt; to slow you down. 30th level was like this, but I am told <br/>
&gt; 35th is worse, and<br/>
&gt; 40th is worse still. Don&#39;t know anyone on my server to have <br/>
&gt; reached 45th or<br/>
&gt; 49th to tell me whether they are the same, as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>49th is the same as any other level, just hard to find stuff that gives you<br/>
exp, since a lot of stuff is green that used to be blue.  45th is definitely<br/>
a hell level, and is the worst.  Took me 10 days to get from 45 to 46,<br/>
playing every day several hours.  Half-bubble to a bubble for a long game<br/>
day is a good thing.  Getting a bubble at 45 is like getting a whole normal<br/>
level it feels like.  Bet you can&#39;t wait now hehe.<br/>
