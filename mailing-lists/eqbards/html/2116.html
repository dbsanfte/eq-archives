<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155765396">In the case of &#39;SOS&#39; (skill on success) skills, such as sense heading, which<br/>
only make the skill check if you&#39;ve actually sensed your direction, that is<br/>
true.  Alcohol tolerance requires that you make a saving roll before there<br/>
is a skill check, modified by your skill level. There are very few SOS<br/>
skills in the game.<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of combat skills (with the exception of Instill Doubt)<br/>
will make a skill check every instance they are used, (SBU, skill by use)<br/>
not every instance of success  Keep in mind that the monsters you are<br/>
fighting, or defending yourself from MUST be in your experience range.  Some<br/>
greens that don&#39;t give you exp in a group will still allow you to skill<br/>
though.  The reason is, they are just at the lower limit of your exp range,<br/>
and if you were solo you would have received a modicum of experience for the<br/>
kill.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the relative difference in level between you and your opponent will<br/>
modify the skill chances.  Fighting a low blue means you are less likely to<br/>
skill than fighting a high red, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
And some skills are scaled higher than others.  It&#39;s less likely that you<br/>
will increase Offense than it is that you will increase a weapons skill.<br/>
Same with Defense, being harder to skill than dodge, parry, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a list of combat related SBU skills<br/>
<br/>
All Weapons skills (checked each swing )<br/>
Offense (checked each swing)<br/>
Ranged and Archery (checked each throw/shot)<br/>
Defense (checked each incoming attack)<br/>
Dodge(checked each incoming attack)<br/>
Parry (checked each incoming attack)<br/>
Riposte(checked each incoming attack)<br/>
Block(checked each incoming attack)<br/>
 Backstab(checked each use)<br/>
Monk special attacks(checked each use)<br/>
Disarm(checked each use)<br/>
Kick (checked each use)<br/>
Bash(checked each use)<br/>

&gt; I have a question about one of your statements in your previous<br/>
&gt;post:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dumping skill points into it won&#39;t make it level faster by<br/>
&gt;use.  1 skill or<br/>
&gt; 100, the chances of skilling are the same every swing, all<br/>
&gt;else being equal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From my experience, I have not found this to be true in the case of<br/>
&gt;non-combat skills.  When I first created my character, I trained one point<br/>
&gt;in sense-heading.  I continually used that skill when moving around.<br/>
&gt;However, it almost never went up.  By the time I was 7th level, my sense<br/>
&gt;heading was only 5.  I got tired of getting lost so I put 5 more points in<br/>
&gt;it to raise it to 10.  Within the next hour or so, my skill in Sense<br/>
Heading<br/>
&gt;increased to 20. I&#39;m now 15th level.  I can now max out my skill in Sense<br/>
&gt;Heading every time I level within five minutes.  My experience with alcohol<br/>
&gt;tolerance was very similar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Could you please clarify your original statement?  Were you<br/>
&gt;referring to combat skills only are were you referring to all skills?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
