lightstone at all times, but there are situations when I wished I could<br/>
have had better vision.  One was when an invisible ranger was waiting to<br/>
steal a spawn from a group I was in the graveyard of Mistmoore with.&lt;gr&gt;<br/>

Also, I have struggled returning to my corpse god knows how many times.<br/>
I&#39;ve literally gotten lost trying to zone from North Qeynos to South<br/>
Qeynos in the tunnel without a light source.  You don&#39;t realize how dark<br/>
those passages are until you&#39;re in one with no infravision, no<br/>
ultravision, no lightstone, and no one else around.<br/>
