&gt;I was messing around outside Kaesora one day when I decided to climb the<br/>
&gt;towers there. I ended up falling inside of one and getting stuck. I had to<br/>
&gt;convince our wizard to climb in after me and port us out. (what a pain.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah _ I complained about that design again and again to no avail.   The <br/>
worst one is right above the entrance to Kaesora, where you can actually <br/>
fall THROUGH the world, because of a crack in the roof.  Now tell me, who, <br/>
exactly, did they plan on seeing that crack?  Godzilla?<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh.<br/>
Also, there&#39;s a building in the Dreadlands where I had to pull people off <br/>
of on more than one occasion.  Naturally, they had already been <br/>
well-ridiculed by their friends - but the lesson was learned: Don&#39;t go <br/>
playing with levitate and SoW if you don&#39;t have Gate.<br/>
