<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052293376">Since you make no money from these banners and you<br/>
want to help out your friends, couldn&#39;t you designate<br/>
a special links page for them?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was (asked? offered?) a place on EverLore.com for<br/>
&gt; the EQ Glossary.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; turned down one previous offer because the site<br/>
&gt; looked like crud, and had <br/>
&gt; nothing to offer in return.  This one, however, is<br/>
&gt; offering to build a <br/>
&gt; database to house the glossary (making updates Ooooh<br/>
&gt; so easy), at the cost <br/>
&gt; of losing my banners.  While this may seem like a<br/>
&gt; no-brainer (especially <br/>
&gt; considering I make NO money from the banners I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; currently hosting), they <br/>
&gt; are for friends of mine, and I&#39;d hate to lose even<br/>
&gt; this piddling little <br/>
&gt; advertising for them.  Unfortunately, Everlore is<br/>
&gt; very strict :P  No <br/>
&gt; banners from outside sources.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t read the contract yet - waiting on a reply<br/>
&gt; about that now.  But I <br/>
&gt; am really ambivalent about this (I *knew* I&#39;d find a<br/>
&gt; way to use that word <br/>
&gt; this week ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So here&#39;s my dilemma - and I&#39;m not saying that you<br/>
&gt; guys are going to solve <br/>
&gt; it for me - I just need some unbiased input here -<br/>
&gt; Do I take the Lady or <br/>
&gt; the Tiger?<br/>
