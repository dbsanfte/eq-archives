<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028846769"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I really don&#39;t know if it is a lot of &quot;mediocre players&quot; are hitting<br/>
&gt;the 50+ range, or if it is all the twinks:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a 45 Bard on my server who&#39;s sooo irresponsible and simply just<br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to play effectively.  I&#39;m talking about endless trains, no<br/>
twisting (constant Berserker Crescendo), doesn&#39;t listen to instructions,<br/>
clueless when it comes to pulling and has no understanding of group<br/>
dynamics.  And a potty mouth to boot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say even a &quot;mediocre&quot; player is better than this person.  Will they be<br/>
like this when they get to 50?  Oh yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Twink or not, if they&#39;re performing less than should be expected for their<br/>
level, I&#39;d class them as a mediocre player.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like on other servers, but on Bertoxx the number of<br/>
bad/mediocre players grossly outweighs the good.  Pardon my French, but we<br/>
seem to have attracted all sorts of crap.<br/>
<br/>
And now with the new experience bonuses?  *shudder*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you think I plan on putting my life on the line assuming<br/>
&gt;he knows how to play his class?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s safe to assume that his non-trade skills such as taunt, kick,<br/>
bash, 1+2hs etc. just won&#39;t be maxed out.  Would you jump in a Ferrari with<br/>
a kid who&#39;s just got his licence?</div>
