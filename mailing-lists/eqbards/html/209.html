<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408641877">Actually, you can&#39;t outrun lions either.  The drum-unaided Selo&#39;s lets<br/>
you run about as fast as a lion, which means if he&#39;s chewing on a party<br/>
member you can get away.  Otherwise you&#39;re lion food.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;To quantify a little:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- I have tangled with Lockjaw twice (died once, zoned the other time only<br/>
&gt;because I was very close)<br/>
&gt;- I was healthy both times (no slow down because of low health)<br/>
&gt;- I did not have a drum in my hand in either case<br/>

&gt;Perhaps with a drum in hand you could outrun this nasty lizard, but I doubt<br/>
