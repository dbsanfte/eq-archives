I just WISH her lull lined worked as effectively as lament has for me since<br/>
the day I got it.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t say no one as druids (harmony, outdoors only but AoE), clerics <br/>
&gt;&gt; and enchanters (lull line) also get calm spells that allow them to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe it&#39;s my charisma, but I haven&#39;t found the spells to be<br/>
&gt;anywhere near as reliable as Lament.  I got lazy for about 10<br/>
&gt;levels and let the clerics and paladins I usually group with<br/>
&gt;do the lulling.  It worked roughly half the time.  I can count<br/>
&gt;on both hands the number of times Lament has failed between<br/>
&gt;level 8-40.<br/>
