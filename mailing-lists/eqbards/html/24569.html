On the topic of velious armor, which would you guys wear between these 2:<br/>
imbrued bp<br/>
phase spider carapace<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m gonna go for a phase bp as has more stats overall, but<br/>
drops 1-2 of em by 2-3 points.<br/>

<br/>
Yes and no.<br/>
<br/>
Resonant (Thurgadin Quest) and Melodic (PoG Drop) are basically the <br/>
same.  They have the same AC and have slightly different stat <br/>
modifiers.  3 dex 2 cha on one vs. 3 cha 2 dex on another kinda thing.<br/>
<br/>
Kael and Skyshrine Quest Armors are superior to both Resonant and <br/>
Melodic and are roughly equivelant to each other.  Kael armor has <br/>
higher AC, Skyshrine has higher stat values (including resists).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be eventually angling after Skyshrine Armor for a couple <br/>
reasons.  Many guilds have already gone after Kael armor, so they&#39;ll <br/>
be less competition for Skyshrine (I hope) and at the super high AC <br/>
these armor already have, if I lose 2 or 3 ac per piece but gain <br/>
across the board in resists, I think I&#39;ll be better off overall.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, it appears the Caster armor is better out of Skyshrine than <br/>
Kael, and my GF plays a mage.... :)<br/>
