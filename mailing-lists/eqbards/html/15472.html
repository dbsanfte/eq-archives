<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521796516">Is this working now/again?  I had done it a long time ago, then it seemed to stop<br/>
working, and in fact one question I asked for Archmage answers was why did it stop<br/>
working and was it intentional.  So John, you used this recently?  I will try it<br/>
again.  I am really pleased to hear this because I loved it when it worked before.<br/>

Here&#39;s something else, let&#39;s see if your experience agrees with mine: you have to<br/>
target the person to use locating lyric.  When a person who is in your group dies<br/>
you see the empty health bar with the sad little puddle of purple at the left.  You<br/>
can still select that person as part of your group at this point.  Once they zone or<br/>
you zone, however, the bar goes grey and you can&#39;t select them.  So if you are<br/>
fortunate to still be alive when your group mate died (hehe like that happens often<br/>
;P), and you don&#39;t have to zone, you may be able to find corpses easier this way.  A<br/>
practical expample of this being useful:  Kithicor when you are fighting at the<br/>
lake, you all run for the zone, and then manage to win the fight there, but one<br/>
person died somewhere on the run.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;First you use Locating Lyric like you normally do.  It&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;point you in the direction of the corpse, but more<br/>
&gt;importantly, it&#39;ll make the corpse your current target.<br/>
&gt;Next you use Solidarity of Vision (L34) to bind sight to the<br/>
&gt;corpse.  Switch to an external camera view, rotate around, and<br/>
&gt;usually you can tell from the surroundings exactly where the<br/>
&gt;corpse is.  VERY useful for finding corpses in dangerous<br/>
&gt;sections of a dungeon, or if the corpse isn&#39;t where the person thinks he died.<br/>
