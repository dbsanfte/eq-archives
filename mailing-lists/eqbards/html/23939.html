<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147914504">i think you are overestimating the resist rate on this song.  i blasted both maestro and innoruk<br/>
with this song up in hate a few weeks ago.  neither of them resisted.  i am/was level 55.<br/>

&gt;&quot;desperate&quot; song, I think it easily could be), it still does so little damage on a high-end MOB that you<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t see the hit bar move.  Why would anyone waste a song slot on this?<br/>

&gt;I wouldn&#39;t care, except that Verant probably thinks they&#39;ve done us a favor, and will count this towards<br/>
&gt;their belief that we&#39;re &quot;balanced&quot;.  And if this is they way they&#39;re going to balance all the REST of the<br/>
&gt;stuff, well....<br/>
