<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264940064">Matt, did you post your idea on the Everquest forums?  Worth a try.  I like<br/>
the idea of a tavern and horses.  It would affect druids and wizards tp, but<br/>
most of my friends are anon anyway because they don&#39;t want to get tells<br/>
asking for a tp(or sow).  But when they are in tp &quot;mode,&quot; it is a major<br/>
money making venture for druids.  They can make hundreds of pp in a single<br/>
night in tp mode.  Hmmm, they would not be happy.  Would have to make money<br/>
like the rest of us - get lucky on a random.<br/>
<br/>
And I also agree with you on just revamp some existing zones, don&#39;t make new<br/>
ones.  Spend the time on existing areas now and soon, not next summer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Wow, some of that stuff sounds great!  /end optimist<br/>
/begin pessimist<br/>
Yea right, when will those changes take place?<br/>
<br/>
Higher grouping xp bonus:  Would be  great and would definitly enhance the<br/>
game.  I like the fact that grouping is so strongly encouraged in EQ.  The<br/>
only way to get people to work together is often to make them unable to<br/>
accomplish much on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Revamping under used dungeons:  Again, would be great for the game.  Places<br/>
like Najeena are a waste (on the whole, my regular group spent 3 weeks there<br/>
getting equipment).  I have never understood why they spend so many<br/>
resources making new zones, when they could spend much less effort fixing<br/>
older ones.  The quickest fix to overcrowding would be to make zones like<br/>
Najena, Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, Kedge Keep and Kithkor more appealing.  Thought<br/>
they face a greater challenge than improving the loot and xp.  They are<br/>
already many very viable zones in the game which are completly ignored.  S<br/>
Ro (the orc/derv camps I am talking about, most people there are looking for<br/>
J Boots), Warslik&#39;s Woods (I think this may be the best 15-25 outdoors in<br/>
the game, but no one uses it), Swamp of No Hope (I dont knwo about the loot,<br/>
but that froglok city could be non stop pulling for a few low/mid level<br/>
groups), Firona Vie (for good characters only) come to mind right away.  I<br/>
have had great grouping experiences in all these zones, but it is impossible<br/>
to find a group there.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem is transportation.  In EQ, moving around is slow, so<br/>
people tend to congregate in certain areas.  A major change to game<br/>
transportation system would be needed to help this.  SOmething along the<br/>
lines of stable where you &quot;rent&quot; a horse to take you to the zone and back<br/>
again for a nominal (it would have to be cheap).  Combine this with an<br/>
Adventurer&#39;s Guild meeting hall/bulletin board.  Where you could talk<br/>
about/post about forming a group to head to XXXXX some monster bashing.  Now<br/>
all of a sudden you have a quick/easy/low risk way to get a group going in a<br/>
less used zone. Example:<br/>
<br/>
You log on for your 2-3 hours after work, with your 21 bard.  Zone into the<br/>
adventurers hall in firona vie. Wander over to the forming groups section of<br/>
the hall, and listen in.  Nothing strikes your interest, but you remember<br/>
how great of a time you had kill renegade iksars in Warslik&#39;s Woods last<br/>
week, so you post a message on the board.  &quot;Starting a group for lvls 18-24.<br/>
Destination: Renegade Iksar Lake in Warslik&#39;s Woods&quot;.  You then start asking<br/>
around in group forming area.  Pretty soon you;ve added a 19 sk and a 20<br/>
mage to your party.  Thats enough to start hitting the iksars.  Granted you<br/>
will have to be careful with no healer, but your song, and the pet should be<br/>
able to keep things moving.  You all head to the stables area, and pay 10g<br/>
for a round trip horse rental.  Right click on your horse (make sure you<br/>
have a inv spot open!!), wait for the interuptable 10 second cast time (to<br/>
prevent abusing these poor beasts in battle).  Zoning please wait...<br/>
<br/>
Ahh the horse destination of WSW.  A quick run to the lake, people mem their<br/>
spells/songs, and you are fighting away.  15 minutes later, a druid has seen<br/>
your post on the board and sends you a tell,  &quot;Got room for a 22 druid?&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Great!  We need a healer, come on over&quot;  5 minutes later, he arrives in<br/>
your camp and joins in.  20 minutes later.  Sk says, &quot;Uh oh wife has come<br/>
home, I have to camp&quot;.  He hits his horse, waits for the cast, then is back<br/>
in the Adventurer&#39;s Guild, camping for the night. (The horse is expired<br/>
then, you would also have to make them lore and no drop I would think).<br/>
Your group decides that your reall need a better tank, so you all /ran 100<br/>
and the loser hits his horse and tries recruiting one at the meeting hall.<br/>
<br/>
It doesnt seem that outlandish to me.  Just requires to admit that<br/>
sacraficing the &quot;thrill&quot; of running through 6 zones only to not find a group<br/>
is outweighed by the fun of being able to form groups in lesser used<br/>
locations.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; This is the whole patch and some general discussion from Alan and Brad.  I<br/>
&gt; like the idea of more xp bonus for grouping and certain underused<br/>
dungeons.<br/>
&gt; I agree we will see how exactly &quot;Working as intended&quot; is defined this<br/>
time.<br/>
