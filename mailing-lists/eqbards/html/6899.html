<b>Subject:</b> RE: Petiton to replace level 14 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-729641030">For suggestion #1, the intent was to get the same heal/stamina effect<br/>
without having to weave/use up two song slots.  <br/>
<br/>
The idea of a bard petition was suggested last week.  I think that most of<br/>
us would be satisfied if Verant just gave us an official answer to the<br/>
questions that you stated.  If they were to acknowledge that problems<br/>
existed and that they were working on it then I would be happy with that.<br/>
Perhaps instead of a petition for the items you listed we just send them a<br/>
list of our concerns.  That would probably have a better chance of getting a<br/>
response than a class petition would.<br/>
<br/>
As I stated in the original message, Verant giving bards the ability to bind<br/>
will probably never happen.  I threw it out there because if I didn&#39;t<br/>
someone else would have.  I figured it would be best to go ahead and get it<br/>
out of the way. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or<br/>
&gt; toned<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want the combined power of these songs, why don&#39;t you just twist<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; together?  Or are you saying that you&#39;ll like the equivelent of being able<br/>
&gt; to play an extra song at the same time?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we were to generate a petition, I think more important issues should be<br/>
&gt; covered:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Where the hell are our missing songs?!<br/>
&gt; 2) Why do half our skills cap at such a ridiculously low level that they<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t even worth using?<br/>
&gt; 3) Is our level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody broken?  If not, what<br/>
&gt; the hell is it supposed to do?<br/>
&gt; 4) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>
&gt; monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?<br/>
&gt; 5) Why do our songs get stuck due to lag, or when magical effects wear off<br/>
&gt; (i.e. Guise of the Deciever)<br/>
&gt; 6) Why the $#%@#$ does my drum still look like a small wooden twig?  And<br/>
&gt; why<br/>
&gt; does a mino horn now look like a small burlap sack?<br/>
&gt; 7) How about some high level bard quests?<br/>
