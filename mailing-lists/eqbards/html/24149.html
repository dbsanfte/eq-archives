<div id="ygrps-yiv-192063937">because, adding a warrior, rogue, monk, or cleric is going to be more useful<br/>
than a bard helping some wizards med.  also, all our wizards will be oom and<br/>
barely have put a dent in the 500K HP of one of these mobs, and will be<br/>
using their no mana lure items like VP staff anyway.<br/>

&gt; according to people<br/>
&gt; on this list (and others) they take in the range of 10 <br/>
&gt; minutes to kill.<br/>
&gt; Which means med times matter.  SO why wouldn&#39;t having a bard <br/>
&gt; in the wizard<br/>
&gt; group be useful? </span></blockquote></div>
