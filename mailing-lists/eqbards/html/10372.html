<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115205962">I have also came up with the same formula when it comes to using the lute<br/>
and Hymm. I believe when I reached lvl 21 is when my natural regen rate<br/>
changed to 3hp so that would be why your regen is 13 with hymm.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;at 6th level it&#39;s doing 6 hp per pulse and 12th level it&#39;s 8 hp per pulse<br/>
&gt; &gt;(sitting).  The weird part is that at 24th level I started doing 13 hp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>per<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;pulse and 11 sitting down (the difference used to be just one between<br/>
&gt; &gt;sitting and standing) so I that seems to blow the formula but that&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt;I always heard.<br/>

&gt; I often sing it while smacking away in combat.<br/>
&gt; You are confused a bit mixing in the natural regen rate here.  At 12 you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 8 pts per pulse with lute while sitting total.  That&#39;s 6 from Hymn plus 2<br/>
&gt; natural.  At 18th you get 10 per pulse sitting total, again 8 from Hymn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>plus<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2 natural.  Your sitting regen rates increases past 2 after 20th level,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sure exactly when but I know it goes up to 3 natural regen somewhere soon<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or after 20th.<br/>
&gt; Using my formula for lute of (1hp + 1hp/6lvls)*2 means at 12 hymn should<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6, it does; at 18th it should do 8, again it does.  It does half that much<br/>
&gt; without lute so you get at 12th level Hymn for 3, plus 1 natural so 4.  At<br/>
&gt; 18 it would be 4 plus 1 natural so 5.  These both fit the actual result so<br/>
&gt; the equation is correct.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;More simply put, Hymn starts at 6 per pulse at 6th level (but you&#39;d get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>two<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;from just sitting without the song) and it improves 2 hp per pulse every<br/>
&gt; six<br/>
&gt; &gt;levels after.  This is not dependent on string skill level because I hear<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt;keeps going up even after we&#39;ve maxed string.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Same as you get with my equation, Hymn does 4pt at 6th, plus the 2 for<br/>
&gt; sitting = 6.<br/>
