<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839244626">Got my mask last night;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the people who posted info on navigating<br/>
the place.  I camped the room with a pickup group of<br/>
35-45 lvl players (they only let me join if I would<br/>
play manasong 24/7 -- and I always try to play<br/>
requests &lt;g&gt;) -- for what it&#39;s worth, they were a<br/>
great group of players.<br/>
<br/>
Some thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
Even just singing manasong, my group was amazed at how<br/>
mobs aggroed me.  I was careful but still died a lot. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are several ways to get to the undead side, find<br/>
the main entrance (with the ramp) that all the<br/>
regulars use.  It is listed as &quot;7&quot; on the upper guk<br/>
map from eqatlas. All the navigation info posted is<br/>
from that point.  If you haven&#39;t been thru Guk yet,<br/>
it&#39;s confusing the first few times you go in.<br/>
<br/>
Mine was a 6 hour camp. Maximumeq lists the spawn time<br/>
of the assasin at 29 minutes (in the comments<br/>
section).  But that is incorrect (and my wife is very<br/>
pissed off at me this morning for all the time I spent<br/>
camping that thing...)  Point here is, have a pot of<br/>
coffee on, you may be luckier than me, but the assasin<br/>
is a rare spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Buy several invis to undead potions, take 2 with you<br/>
and leave the rest in the bank...bind at the bank in<br/>
FP and run SOuth thru Ro, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately upon zoning in, do an ooc asking if the<br/>
assasin room is camped.  Then ask if you can approach<br/>
and loot.  I did this and the group holding the room<br/>
told two people arriving there before me that the mask<br/>
was for the two bards trying to fumble their way in.<br/>
<br/>
Torel:  if you are reading this, I would have let you<br/>
loot the mask first if you hadn&#39;t logged.  I was a bit<br/>
pissed that you logged and then came back after I died<br/>
as many times as I did in that room: but you did win<br/>
the loot roll and you did say you were coming back.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting to you all,<br/>
