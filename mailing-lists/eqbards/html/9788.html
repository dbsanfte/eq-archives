<br/>
I think you got your GZ answer?  You read the response we got from him on<br/>
som ebard questions - his sig was at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
The gargoyles are found in the Ocean of Tears (take the boat from Freeport<br/>
and it sails through OOT).  I do not have first hand experience with them<br/>
but a monk friend had been to visit them and he is about 20ish.  He trained<br/>
the giant skels to the Gargs and feigned i guess.  Then let the Garg and<br/>
Skel duke it out.  Then he recoved and killed the weakened Garg.  Not sure<br/>
you could handle them at level 12 - i got the feeling they were higher level<br/>
but really dont know.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Some Questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is my original post.  Somehow it didn&#39;t make the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on the list and decided it&#39;s time to join in.  Here are a<br/>
couple of questions.<br/>
<br/>
Who is GZ?  I&#39;ve seen it mentioned several times in talking about Verant,<br/>
but it&#39;s not in the glossary I went to to try and get an answer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just gotten my 12th song and have been hunting Dervs in N Ro.  ButI<br/>
remember reading somewhere about an Island that has Gargoyles that would be<br/>
appropriate <br/>
for someone near my level to hunt.  I remember theposter said that the loot<br/>
was worth about a plat each and weighed 0.1lbs.  Does this ring any bells<br/>
for <br/>
anyone?  <br/>
<br/>
The Derv camps are just too crowded and often with people that think they<br/>
are super-heros.  I lost my 12th level and had to regain it from just such a<br/>
<br/>
person.  Killed while memming bellow for the first time andthey trained the<br/>
Dervs onto me. (Grrr)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve enjoyed the interaction here and look forward to your<br/>
responses.  Thanks in advance and <br/>
<br/>
May your voice always sing true,<br/>
