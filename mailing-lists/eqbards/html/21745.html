&gt; &gt;*looks over his shoulder*<br/>
&gt; &gt;*puts tin foil over his head*  &lt;-- simpsons episode where baseball league<br/>
&gt; &gt;was spying on consumers<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;P.S. I doubt anyone saw this commercial (for NFL) for the Ottawa Senators<br/>
&gt; &gt;but its a parody of Sixth Sense. The 2 are in the car at a stop light, and<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt;crossing guard is helping kids cross the street and the kid in the car<br/>
&gt;tursn<br/>
&gt; &gt;to his mom and says in a whisper &quot;i see hockey players&quot;. cracks me up every<br/>
&gt; &gt;time<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You probably mean NHL. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I tried to find the commercial you mentioned on http://www.adcritic.com,<br/>
&gt;but didn&#39;t see much for the NHL. BTW, you can spend hours at<br/>
&gt;www.adcritic.com. You&#39;ve been warned. ;-)<br/>
