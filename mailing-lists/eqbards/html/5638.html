&gt;If someone decides to write the advanced bard guide for EQVault it would be<br/>
&gt;nice if the list of mobs with the innate ability to See Invisibility was<br/>
&gt;also included.  Would also be good to have this info in the Bard Song<br/>
&gt;analysis that is posted on someone&#39;s bard site (can&#39;t remember whose website<br/>
&gt;it is but Talies the Wanderer come to mind).<br/>

I&#39;ll post something there about the variability, but I won&#39;t go so far as<br/>
to put a full-out list, sorry.<br/>
