&gt;&gt; p.s. has anyone seen Lord Grimlot recently? I have tried clearing the skelly<br/>
&gt;&gt; camp in SK in an effort to get him to spawn but no luck.  Does he only spwan<br/>
&gt;&gt; if the quest is initiated?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I killed Lord Grimrot in a group of three L35s (the badass Grim, not<br/>
&gt;  the weaker one... two spawned, L25 and L35)  The L35 Grimrot carrys<br/>
&gt;  a no-drop scythe that procs something (usable, but for a quest).  I<br/>
&gt;  heard the rumor of the quest connected to him and Mistmoore, I never<br/>
&gt;  followed up on it.  He has since been removed from the game.  I&#39;ve not<br/>
&gt;  seen him since I was in my L30s.  Either he got really, really rare<br/>
&gt;  and no one has cleaned the camp long enough or he&#39;s poofed.  My guess<br/>
&gt;  is the latter.<br/>
