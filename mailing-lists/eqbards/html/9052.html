&gt; My group has been hunting here quite a bit, and it IS a<br/>
&gt; very nice place to hunt.  Lots of things to charm, lots of<br/>
&gt; space to run.  There are three big things to worry about<br/>
&gt; though, from my experience:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - The pathing and warping in the zone is VERY bad.  <br/>
&gt; You&#39;ll be fighting a giant and suddenly it&#39;s just GONE.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  I tend not to use Chain/fear in there unless I have<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes it warps just a short distance, which is no big<br/>
&gt; deal, he&#39;ll come running after you quickly enough.  The<br/>
&gt; real danger is when they warp a long distance away, and<br/>
&gt; then never come back.  Never, that is, until you happen to<br/>
&gt; walk near him later, and he comes running with his 4 giant<br/>
&gt; friends and the little cyclops who wants to be part of the<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the area we were fighting (near the entrance pass with the<br/>
stone) there seems to be one spot where the warp to - a good<br/>
deal further South near the lizard camp.  Once I figured this<br/>
out, it was pretty easy to go and retrieve the giants that did<br/>
warp away.  There&#39;s also a pathing bug near the pass.  Unless<br/>
you pull a giant across a ridge there against the wall, it<br/>
will head for this warp spot.<br/>
<br/>
On the up side, this meant if we got in trouble in a fight,<br/>
fear would be much more effective.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - Sometimes there&#39;s too MANY hill giants.  When you&#39;re in<br/>
&gt; a group, one hill giant is tasty, two makes them see how<br/>
&gt; powerful you are as a bard.  Three means run to the zone.<br/>
&gt; Four means run to the zone and try and take a screen cap.  <br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The group I was with could handle a hill giant without me.  If<br/>
we got three, I&#39;d tell them to take one, then I&#39;d pull the<br/>
other two aside to let them get better aquainted.  :-)  We<br/>
never got four.  There were several groups there fighting<br/>
(though I suspect we were doing the most killing since with<br/>
charm you have zero downtime).  We pulled a couple giants off<br/>
them if they got too much, so I think they would&#39;ve done the<br/>
same if we got four.<br/>
