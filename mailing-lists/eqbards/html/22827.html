<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908911839">Actually, Verant posted that the negative faction hits are MUCH greater than the<br/>
respective positive<br/>
faction hits.  So if you kill 50 dorfs, 50 dragons and 50 giants, you&#39;ll end up<br/>
KOS to all three.  I suppose<br/>
you might still be barely non-KOS to the giants, since killing dorfs and dragons<br/>
both increase giant,<br/>
but I have no doubt that you would need to kill 5+ giants to counteract the dorf<br/>
faction you lose for killing<br/>
1 dorf.<br/>

I guess i&#39;ll have to raise/lower them equally and hope the raises are bigger<br/>
then the lowers, eventually *might* end up amiable 8)  No bone chips quests<br/>
by any chance huh? 8)<br/>

Not that I have found.  The Giant quest I did lowered dwarf and the dwarf<br/>
quest lowered giant...<br/>

<br/>
ya but question is... which is the most valuable to keep... dragon or dwarf<br/>
or giant.  I&#39;m assuming 2 out of 3 to keep.  I&#39;m just wondering if there&#39;s a<br/>
way to raise factions without lowering the others,  but probably isnt<br/>

Killing Giants raises dwarves and dragons, I aimagine killing dwarves would<br/>
raise giants and dragons but am not sure.  I also imagine that killing<br/>
dragons will raise dwarves and giants.  Seems like you basically choose one<br/>
faction to hurt out of the three.  Note that the minus faction hits are more<br/>
significant than the plus hits so you can&#39;t kill the same number of giants<br/>
and dwarves without expecting to be KoS to both.<br/>

To you all that have been to Velious... Which factions are you watching out<br/>
for?<br/>
<br/>
from the little that I&#39;ve been/understand of it is that you kill 1 other 2<br/>
like you and so on<br/>
<br/>
Dragons/Giants/Dwarves<br/>
