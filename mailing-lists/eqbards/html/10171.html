&gt; I remember when I couldn&#39;t WAIT for dual wield :)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is how I understand it:  Every time your primary weapon <br/>
&gt; swings, you<br/>
&gt; make a dual wield skill check.  IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT <br/>
&gt; THE DELAY IS<br/>
&gt; ON THE WEAPON YOU HAVE IN YOUR SECONDARY HAND.. Many people I <br/>
&gt; know use a<br/>
&gt; really low delay weapon in their primary and the higher damage, higher<br/>
&gt; delay weapon in their secondary, because they&#39;ll get that many more<br/>
&gt; chances to swing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IIRC, it first checks the delay on your secondary weapon... then it checks<br/>
your dual wield score.  If you pass your dual wield check, then you&#39;ll swing<br/>
with your secondary.  For that reason, it is advantageous to use a really<br/>
quick weapon in your secondary slot (at least for raising your skill).<br/>
