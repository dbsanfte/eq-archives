<div id="ygrps-yiv-414064638">Well, we unanimously agreed that bards should stop songs before the monk <br/>
leaves to pull. It is possible that the monk could be coming back with a mob <br/>
or 10 feign, bard song hits him, hate list transfers, he feigns, mob comes <br/>
to rape you. Or something like that. Better safe than sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I am pretty sure the 19/29 weapon is for WAR/SK, maybe PAL/RNG, and not for <br/>
BRD/ROG. Will ask next time I talk to the guy who got it.<br/>
<br/>
I keep hearing Imbrued is dropped on scorn banshees, but I won&#39;t believe it <br/>
til I see it. Not too interested in the rapier either - if I were to get one <br/>
and we killed Mr. Maestro that would knock me out of lottoing rights on his <br/>
loots. =) Either way I won&#39;t give up a Yak for a rapier.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

&gt;last time i was there,i was told the same thing.  the consensus was to sing<br/>
&gt;away until the monk went to pull, then all bards stopped singing.  no idea<br/>
&gt;if it means anything, but better to keep everyone happy and keep the bards<br/>
&gt;out of blame for trains =)  i haven&#39;t been there since the feign death<br/>
&gt;changes, so don&#39;t know how that changes the pulling strategy, but everytime<br/>
&gt;i have been there it was a monk pulling and an enchanter scouting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;we have yet to see any imbrued in hate yet either, all bards that have any<br/>
&gt;got it from fear.  good luck on either a rapier, or those beautiful weps on<br/>
&gt;our favorite guy the maestro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shada<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s. 19/29 drool, i hope it wasn&#39;t bard!  then i don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
&gt;not having one =) </span></blockquote></div>
