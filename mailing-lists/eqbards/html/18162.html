<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312219965">Okay, I won&#39;t spoil it too much for you guys but Kunark is AWESOME: <br/>
Rejoice you are a bard because it is mammoth in scale and its mostly<br/>
outdoors.  I simply cannot tell you how happy I am, btw, that we have charm<br/>
back again. =)<br/>
<br/>
New Songs:<br/>
Selos51 is broken of course, you get invis/see invis/lev but no speed. <br/>
Everything sees invis anyhow but trust me, you&#39;ll want lev.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to the good stuff:<br/>
Our armor is Singing Steel, neon green plate - like Hero Bracer type green<br/>
not drab ranger green.  Yes Tork is sporting Singing Steel and loving it.<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
New weapons!  New graphics!  LOTS of new stuff!<br/>
<br/>
I got dawnchaser (first one on Nameless) this weekend, last night I got a<br/>
near godly piercing weapon: Sacrdioan&#39;s (sp) Partisan!  That time spent<br/>
with the ol&#39; obsidian shard to get to 200 was worth it - I&#39;m a regular<br/>
pigsticker with the new shoulder armor... um nevermind... =)<br/>
