&gt;Problem 1: Overlapping duties.  Many Bard tasks can be done better by<br/>
&gt;Enchanters.  Crowd control, buffs, and mana regen are the big three.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once the enchanters get the spells. As a low level bard, I have grouped with<br/>
near-level enchanters with no problems whatsoever. Consider using the bard<br/>
songs for the buffs (quickness, etc) and saving the enchanter&#39;s mana for<br/>
crowd control -- their specialty.<br/>
<br/>
However, to some extent, this is the same problem that enchanters get when<br/>
you have two in the same group -- and bards when you have two.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Problem 2: Enchanters make Bard AoE songs more or less useless.<br/>
&gt;Since so many<br/>
&gt;of our songs are AoE, our playlist is more limited than a Los<br/>
&gt;Angeles Top 40<br/>
&gt;FM station when grouping with an enchanter.  I&#39;ve just learned on this list<br/>
&gt;that Largo does NOT wake up mezzed mobs, so I&#39;m adding that back into my<br/>
&gt;&quot;Enchanter Hotkey&quot; bank.  That&#39;s good news.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not high enough level to have lots of problem with this. Do the Rhythms<br/>
songs mess up enchanters? How about heal (though I know you probably don&#39;t<br/>
want to play that in combat) According to the list at caster&#39;s realm thoug,<br/>
only 7 of our songs are AoE in the fist place. And the last is a 48th level<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know how many of the buffs overwrite higher level enchanter buffs<br/>
as my enchanter is still lower level.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;charm classes too.  However, there is a unique problem with<br/>
&gt;Enchanters.  The other night I got into a group in Unrest by the fountains.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the group members was a casting Troll.  &quot;Shaman,&quot; I thought to myself.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Suddenly, a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;typical Unrest train comes roaring by bearing half the house.  I<br/>
&gt;kick in the invis song to protect the group when the message &quot;Gebaner<br/>
 </span></blockquote>slashes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;itself for 32000 points of damage&quot; pops up, followed by a severe reaming<br/>
 </span></blockquote>from the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Enchanter who was in troll form.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I make it a point, when joining groups, to find out what classes are.<br/>
Of course, one of my main characters is an enchanter and that may make me<br/>
more sensitive<br/>
to this :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Problem 4: For some reason, most Enchanters I&#39;ve grouped with are total<br/>
&gt;jackasses.  They are constantly barking orders (usually in all caps) and<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is a problem of who you have grouped with. I have met rude<br/>
people<br/>
in every class, and enchanters are NOT at the top of the classes rude people<br/>
tend<br/>
to be in.<br/>
