&gt; Can you explain what you mean here? The way I interpret it is that it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t matter if you sing Elemental or Purifying Rhythm in regards to<br/>
&gt; resisting a disease/poison DOT because those spells check your magic resist<br/>
&gt; rate (which will be the same for both songs).   How were you able to<br/>

A lot of paladins complain about this one.  Some high level<br/>
disease and poison DoTs require cancel magic to dispel them.  <br/>
Cure poison/disease will not work on them, even though you&#39;d<br/>
think it would.  I would assume they do check your<br/>
disease/poison resist.<br/>
