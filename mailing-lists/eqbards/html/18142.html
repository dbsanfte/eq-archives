<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699895126">While the following is a spoiler - it describes travel to and from Kunark.<br/>
I &quot;wasted&quot; a good four hours of time so unless you consider waiting for and<br/>
on boats for long periods of time a vital part of the role-playing<br/>
experience - I would suggest you read on.<br/>

1) Oasis Route.  There is a raft on the Oasis dock - it will take you to an<br/>
Ogre Village in Timorous.  I believe these are the &quot;Broken Teeth&quot; Islands on<br/>
the cloth map.<br/>
<br/>
You will be taken to an Ogre village.  The Ogres I saw conned green to me -<br/>
but there are probably a goodly number of them. I wasn&#39;t KOS - but I guy I<br/>
eventually hooked up with was...  If you are working your way back - the loc<br/>
is +7000 +3300<br/>
<br/>
I ended up finding the wrong dock - there is an &quot;Evil Boat&#39; That will take<br/>
you to The Overthere.  This is a nasty zone.  It&#39;s an undead City.<br/>
Everything Conned red to me - and to a 48(?) Paladin I hooked up with.  The<br/>
boat &quot;Looks&quot; Evil so you&#39;ll know it if you see it.  We didn&#39;t get off the<br/>
boat (one of the con&#39;ed red things was literally ON the dock).<br/>
<br/>
We zoned back to that dock.  If I recall properly it was also an Ogre<br/>
Village.  If my notes are correct the loc for this dock is neg 5000 neg 3700<br/>
<br/>
Through shouts we got the loc of the High-Elf village with the correct dock<br/>
to Fironia Vie.  IF my notes are correct - (they are pretty cryptic at this<br/>
point) the loc is neg 200 pos 3600. You shouldn&#39;t have probs getting exact<br/>
loc from people who are making the return route as the boat stops there.<br/>
<br/>
We had to swim a lot to get there - but I&#39;m not sure whether this is true if<br/>
you know where you&#39;re going from the Oasis Raft Dock.  I thought I heard<br/>
someone say &quot;Go to South End of the Island&quot; which would imply no swimming -<br/>
but perhaps it was &quot;Go to the South Island&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Regardless - for me -  I explored the boat (IT&#39;S HUGE with spots yet<br/>
unfilled for NPC&#39;s) I didn&#39;t realize that I ended up on the wrong side of<br/>
the boat and had to make the circuit twice.<br/>
<br/>
REMEMBER - DOCKS ON LEFT SIDE OF BOAT - so for this route - you stay on the<br/>
left side of the boat from the dock you got on at the High Elf Village to<br/>
get off at Fironia Vie.<br/>
<br/>
From when I left Oasis to when I actually got to Fironia Vie - 3 hours.<br/>
<br/>
I got bound - and then went the short way from the city to the tunnel that<br/>
takes you to Dreadlands and hooked up with a pickup group.  There was a lot<br/>
of confusion and problems with a Ranger who eventually got booted.  There<br/>
was an excellent Bard - Ripkey (I don&#39;t think he was on the list) in the<br/>
group however.  Among other annoying things - the Ranger kept telling us to<br/>
&quot;Sing Heal During Combat&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But shortly there after - Several guildmates (led by Guild Leader 43 Level<br/>
Druid who tp&#39;d to the Dreadlands) got on - and I wanted to hook up with<br/>
them...<br/>
<br/>
2) Wizards and Druids can TP to the Dreadlands.  This is a huge zone - I<br/>
believe larger than anything pre-expansion.  Plenty of hunting grounds.<br/>
<br/>
We spent an hour or so (including several dumps) trying to figure out how my<br/>
Guild&#39;s group could get to me without luck.  Arkin died once...  Then we<br/>
decided the only way to hook up would be for me to travel back to<br/>
Butcherblock and get a TP from Druid Circle.<br/>
<br/>
The negative - on release day at least - no one had found the way from the<br/>
TP spot to the zone Fironia Vie (the High-Elf City) - hopefully that will<br/>
change soon.  The Guild group and I couldn&#39;t hook up until I did the<br/>
painfully long boat trip to BB for pickup.<br/>
<br/>
3) Butcherblock route.   Take the OTHER dock in Butcherblock from the<br/>
Freeport boat.  There will be little shuttles - this will zone to Timorous<br/>
Deep and connect to the Boat.  The boat is very large.<br/>
<br/>
BUG REPORT - I went the opposite direction - so can&#39;t confirm it - But an EQ<br/>
Vault they reported probs with Shuttle. Take the 1st on one route.  If your<br/>
shuttle doesn&#39;t hook up with the loading dock on the side of the boat - jump<br/>
off and climb up the rudder.<br/>
<br/>
The shuttles connect with the right side of the boat.  Move to the left<br/>
side.  There are a couple of stops in Timorous - this zone is the equiv. of<br/>
OOT.  Don&#39;t get off here if you&#39;re going to Fironia Vie.  Eventually it will<br/>
zone there and the dock on the left side.<br/>
<br/>
I did the return route - had just missed the boat in Firnonia.  Took about<br/>
an hour (I&#39;m not kidding)<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve only seen 2 zones - and the Dreadlands at least are so big I<br/>
doubt that crowding will be an issue.<br/>
