<div id="ygrps-yiv-170773467">No, but since our mez spells are effectively useless a mere 5 levels after<br/>
we get them, why give them to us at all?  Even before the change we were in<br/>
no way as effective as an enchanter in mezzing.  Not even close.  We went<br/>
from being an acceptable secondary choice to being no longer available as an<br/>
option where mezzing was required.<br/>

I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have to be a level 50 bard to be able to give opinions <br/>
of a bard&#39;s usefulness. Each level of a bard should be considered when <br/>
making an evaluation. I remember groups loving my level 10 bard and how <br/>
little downtime the group experienced with Hymn. That&#39;s probably the best <br/>
thing I feel about bards is their ability to reduce downtime.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I agree with Kitasi about bards being totally nerfed to the point <br/>
of ineffectiveness. Verant has stated that the Bard&#39;s mezmerize will never <br/>
be as effective as an enchanters.  As a matter of fact, at level 40 in City <br/>
of Mist, I can really only effectively reduce the number of mobs attacking <br/>
my group by 1 (with charm) and have him attack a mob that is currently <br/>
being engaged by my group. Unlike an enchanter, who would be able to <br/>
effectively mez 2 or 3 of them. It does seem that the higher level up a <br/>
bard goes, the less effective a crowd controller they become.<br/>
<br/>
I still have a lot of fun with my 40 bard. I still am mostly in pickup <br/>
groups (part time bard who only plays at most 3 hours) and those groups all <br/>
love having me. Most don&#39;t realize I can charm and help with crowd control <br/>
(of course they all know about clarity). I did some pulling (lament still <br/>
works nicely), some charming mobs off of our healer, and then battle <br/>
buffing. When there&#39;s not an enchanter around, the tanks all pray for my <br/>
Celerity to speed their attack.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, after I told my enchanter friend about how lousy bard mez is, he <br/>
mentioned that they should at least give bards a way to slow down the mobs <br/>
attack. I laughed and said that we get both target and AOE slow down songs. <br/>
I haven&#39;t sung Largo&#39;s in a long time, due to aggro problems. But I may <br/>
throw that in the mix and see how it works.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you really wanted to play a character that is the best of class <br/>
in what they do, then a bard is not for you. Bards are versatile and can <br/>
help every group they join. I find I have to tell my groups what I&#39;m doing <br/>
for them to give them a better appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I really thank those who posted some of their various &quot;macros&quot; for <br/>
weaving. I&#39;ve found that the one for &quot;Hymn and Clarity&quot; weaving for <br/>
downtime is great. My weary fingers thank you!<br/>
