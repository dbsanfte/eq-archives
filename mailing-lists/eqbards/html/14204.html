<div id="ygrps-yiv-829042431">Not useless at all imo.  I can enter Grobb (and frequently do) to bank from<br/>
Guk and from Oggok.  I could enter Oggok and bank until I started killing<br/>
their Bouncers.  Being able to bank and trade in Oggok from Cazic-Thule and<br/>
the Rathe Mts. as a good race was a real blessing in my 30s.  BTW it took me<br/>
ONE Bouncer kill to go from apprehensive to dubious and only three more<br/>
kills to become KOS in Oggok with the mask on, however, I&#39;m only KOS to<br/>
Bouncers.  I can still use the vendors with the mask on despite my<br/>
horrendous faction, whereas I cannot without.  I cannot enter Neriak with<br/>
the mask, but had killed many of their guards before I got the mask.<br/>

&gt; Ah, so if this is the case, I am then a dark elf who worships Tunare, and<br/>
&gt; has been killing orcs and such all his life, not to mentin DE guards and<br/>
&gt; guardians.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, that would explain it, I guess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Still useless, though.<br/>
