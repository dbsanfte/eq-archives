&gt; Chants with a drum at L50:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FCC = ~31 damage/6 sec<br/>
&gt; CoF = 48 damage/6 sec<br/>
<br/>
&gt; total = 127 damage/6 sec = 21.2 damage/sec<br/>
&gt; total w/ MM drum = 148 damage/6 sec = 24.7 damage/sec<br/>
&gt; total w/ Selo&#39;s drum = 169 damage/6 sec = 28.2 damage/sec<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, one chant is missing here?  I am guessing you say both CoFl and CoFr<br/>
doing 48 dmg?<br/>
<br/>
I just did a quick test Chant of Frost with Mistmoore Drum: 108 total dmg on<br/>
myself (presuming the 2/3&#39;s nerf for PvP - that means I can do 54 dmg per<br/>
round).<br/>
<br/>
Remember, after you equip your drum (and get the crap graphic), you can<br/>
equip you range wep and that will be the current graphic visible to the<br/>
outside world.  Heh, I do it with my runed bone fork and it looks like I am<br/>
playing my spear ;p  - will be good to do when chanting mobs.   Time to kite<br/>
some Ice Giants???<br/>
