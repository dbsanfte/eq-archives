<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000830206">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a conspiracy - just a complete lack of understanding<br/>
of the dynamic of the class and how it really works.<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant has complete lack of theory of game play.  They seem to think<br/>
that not requiring mana makes the bard class completely powerful.  It is<br/>
clear that no one at Verant &quot;Plays&quot; a bard character using the retail<br/>
client.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played a necro now to level 6 and I can see how they can come to this<br/>
conclusion.  When you are out of mana you are somewhat vulnerable in a way<br/>
that a bard isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I think to truly understand the way the game works you have to play it.  You<br/>
have to really understand the limitations.  We have no items that let us<br/>
twist more songs - while casters get INT/WIS and mana boosting items.<br/>
<br/>
There are no spells that let us twist more (i.e. clarity/manasong).<br/>
<br/>
People have been posting excellent analysis of this on the Verant boards -<br/>
talking about opportunity costs - and mana management (i.e. how many mobs<br/>
can an Enchanter keep mezzed indefinitely with clarity on and meditating<br/>
through it).<br/>
<br/>
But Verant just &#39;doesn&#39;t get it&#39;.  If they played a Bard they would.  It&#39;s<br/>
obvious they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; I think INDIRECTLY there is some truth to it.<br/>
I suspect that when it comes to design, balancing, etc meetings and<br/>
discussions at the meetings - the people there who sincerely do play and<br/>
enjoy Everquest as a player - subconsciously at best (and perhaps even<br/>
consciously) champion their favorite class.  People accuse Abashi of having<br/>
Necro-favoritism.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but believe that there is truth to some degree (again even if<br/>
subconscious) and there is no Bard-player/champion on the design team.<br/>

<br/>
Do you guys honestly think there is some kind of Verant plan to screw over<br/>
bards?<br/>
<br/>
Come back to reality.  Verant is a poorly run company.  Their in house<br/>
testing is abysmal (if it exists at all, which I have serious doubts of).<br/>
Their customer service is embarassing, and their arrogance is the stuff of<br/>
kings.  They just wrote a really good game.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, they treat everyone like that.  Perhaps theres a few more<br/>
bard problems since we are the most unusual class in the game.  (This goes<br/>
back to their lack of testing.)<br/>
<br/>
Why did you expect things to change this time?<br/>
<br/>
Until a viable competitor arrives, this attitude won&#39;t hurt them.  If<br/>
Anarchy Online (which I doubt will be, as its a sci fi setting, which has<br/>
always been a smaller market than fantasy.) is this viable competitor then<br/>
soon we will see them reaping what they have sown.  If not we will have to<br/>
wait for horizons/shadowbane/whatever.  (All of which are a long way away).<br/>
<br/>
Recent posts from Brad indicate to me, they believe the game has reached its<br/>
peak and are preparing for the inevitable shrinking of the population.<br/>
