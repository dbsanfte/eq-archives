<div id="ygrps-yiv-288026118">I concur completely with all your results and use Fear in exactly the same<br/>
way for the same reasons and situations. Fear is my panic button, when I<br/>
absolutely positively have to break off a melee or escape Fear is my goto<br/>
guy. Everyday I have to go thru upper to get to lower guk, and stop at all<br/>
the spawn points in upper on my way. # times I have checked in on the Lord<br/>
and gone LD just long enough to be seen by a pile of frogs. Instead of<br/>
fighting and being gang-raped by greens I Fear them off me and dash to the<br/>
LG zone. Its worked everytime so far, last time I made a train of at least<br/>
25 Frogs in my dash and passed by a 47th Paladin friend going the other way,<br/>
if toons could have surprise on there faces he showed it. There I was with<br/>
25 frogs jumping every which way some Feared, some returning from being<br/>
Feared, it was quite funny and is always a rush. I have made it all the way<br/>
to zone from the tower in LG using this tactic as well(died more often than<br/>
not though, but corpse recovery was always easier). All in all Fear is one<br/>
of our more versatile and important songs, and I would never have guessed it<br/>
before getting it.<br/>

I&#39;ve used Screech everywhere from Unrest to Mistmoore, Sol B, and Lower Guk.<br/>
Here are my two uses, and why I almost always have this song mem&#39;d at<br/>
38th...<br/>
<br/>
Soloing - I made a good part of 30th and some intermitant experience after<br/>
that<br/>
level soloing using screech. I&#39;ll use Unrest as my example. I know Unrest<br/>
inside<br/>
and out, having been a puller there since L18. At 30th, Carrion Ghouls and<br/>
Dry<br/>
Bones were blue to me, so I would pull one outside to a wall, Chain it<br/>
(Selo&#39;s<br/>
Consonant Chain) then hit it with Appalling Screech. As the monster slowly<br/>
walked away, I would chain again, then either hit it with 2 bellows or a<br/>
heal<br/>
and a bellow. When I solo, I fight completely unbuffed. Hitting the monster<br/>
in<br/>
the back saves me from taking alot of hits I cannot afford to take. If I<br/>
pulled<br/>
2 monsters instead of just one, I charmed the one I thought would win,<br/>
ordered<br/>
it to &#39;/pet guard me&#39; then equipped my lute and played Hymn while<br/>
occasionally<br/>
replaying Charm to keep the monster on target. I used this method the first<br/>
time<br/>
I solo&#39;d the Undead Knight of Unrest at 36th, the second time I used a<br/>
festering<br/>
hag to kill him for me (using charm, this was MUCH easier).<br/>
<br/>
In a group - Screech is a devastatingly potent weapon in saving your parties<br/>
collective butt. In lower guk while fighting dar&#39;s, zol&#39;s and a few wan&#39;s<br/>
(the<br/>
L36-46 range of undead froggies) we got trained by the hand room. The group<br/>
leader called for an evac, but we were all being mobbed, including the<br/>
druid. I<br/>
hit screech. No less then 6 L40+ frogs fled in terror, and I was L36. All<br/>
conn&#39;d<br/>
blood red to me. The druid casted the evac successfully and we all escaped.<br/>
<br/>
Example 2: In Solusek B (Nagafen&#39;s Lair) my group got trained while fighting<br/>
the<br/>
Kobold King, a Solusek Kobold Shaman, and a Solusek Kobold. These are all<br/>
38+<br/>
monsters. add to that 2 GK shamen and 5 Greater Kobolds (35ish). I as a L37<br/>
saw<br/>
our main tank drop below 1 bubble and hit screech. WHAM! You see them ALL<br/>
flee<br/>
in terror! Quite impressive to see the kobold king flee in terror.<br/>
<br/>
My only warning: If you use this as an escape tool (group situation) and the<br/>
monster isn&#39;t snared, your group MUST zone. You will start a huge train<br/>
otherwise 90%+ of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Last good use of this song - de-railing a train parked at the zone. I play<br/>
it,<br/>
causing everything at the zone to flee in terror. I then zone. When the fear<br/>
wears off, they no longer have a target on their aggro list (I have zoned)<br/>
so<br/>
they simply go home.<br/>
<br/>
My astounding results even with higher level mobs are with a 165 brass skill<br/>
(for the last few levels). (max would be 190 right now)<br/>
