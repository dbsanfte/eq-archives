<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022269907">And Dvinn is not the only source of the dirk.<br/>
<br/>
But why anyone thinks paying more than steel weapons prices for weapons that<br/>
are better than well balanced is a rip-off is beyond me.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve seen it advertised from as low as 10pp to 100pp.  The big<br/>
&gt;difference between the dirk and other special weapons is that<br/>
&gt;the mob who carries it spawns often, and has it every time.<br/>
&gt;It is going to cause a serious realignment of prices for<br/>
&gt;weapons in the L15-25 range.  I personally wouldn&#39;t pay more<br/>
&gt;than about 15pp for one, maybe 20pp if I were in Qeynos and<br/>
&gt;needed another ASAP.  Any more than that and it&#39;d be more cost<br/>
&gt;effective for my friends and me to trek to Crushbone and get<br/>
&gt;another.<br/>
