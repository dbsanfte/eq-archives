<div id="ygrps-yiv-558315378">The water breathing song and it&#39;s possible uses was one of the big factors<br/>
in playiing a bard for me. Now that I have it I have done some exploring<br/>
(Everfrost river for one) but now I am looking for suggestions for new<br/>
areas. Actually I would like to request folks offer little detail besides<br/>
the zone (unless something is a deathtrap for a level 17, THAT would be<br/>
appreciated) as exploring is 90 percent of the fun. Er, if it&#39;s OOT a<br/>
general loc would be appreciated too, while I would LOVE to search the whole<br/>
OOT I just don&#39;t have that kinda time *laughs*.<br/>
<br/>
Any favorites folks have?<br/>
