<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527251026">lol, bite your tounge!  I don&#39;t get to play much and I want all the exp I<br/>
can get.  Seriously thought, I have mixed feelings.  It is good for people<br/>
like me who are not power gamers and want to eventually see a dragon (I<br/>
have been playing since beta 4).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I played in Karnors last night with a warrior, cleric, monk, and <br/>
&gt;ranger... all I have to say is I earned as much exp in the two hours <br/>
&gt;I was there last night as I had in 6+ hour camps before (and the <br/>
&gt;group was not any better.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone else think maybe the exp is now coming too fast?<br/>
