&gt; Just out of curiousity,  why did your friend retire his 30th level bard?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found leveling a bard (particularly soloing) to be pretty easy, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; 17th level now, but I&#39;ve had this feeling that bards at the higher levels<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t quite cut it compared to other classes.  I&#39;ve heard of how great high<br/>
&gt; wizards are, and I&#39;ve seen a Necro solo hill giants and griffons with his<br/>
&gt; pet, but does anyone know how well high levels bards compare to other<br/>
&gt; classes?<br/>

The corpse had moved because of a bug and was embedded deep in a wall inside<br/>
Runnyeye.  As much as this, well, sucks, personally I feel he really<br/>
overreacted.  Nobody has ever guaranteed that you would be able to get help<br/>
recovering a corpse, even if it was due to a bug.<br/>
<br/>
As to high level bards being on par with other high level classes, it&#39;s not<br/>
really a fair question.  If you&#39;re comparing soloing players, the bard is<br/>
terrible.  Then again, at very high levels, only druids and wizards can really<br/>
solo.  At medium high levels, magicians and necros can solo, and rangers,<br/>
paladins and shadowknights can as well.  Anyone else starts having real trouble.<br/>
<br/>
A high level bard doesn&#39;t have the pure power of a high level wizard who can do<br/>
1100 damage with one spell, but there isn&#39;t a high level wizard around who<br/>
doesn&#39;t want a high level bard grouped with them.  Asmodean, the first level 50<br/>
in beta could dish out 4000+ points of damage before running out of mana, but<br/>
then he had to meditate for over 10 minutes to get his mana back.  If he was<br/>
grouped with a bard, his mana regeneration time would be lessened considerably,<br/>
and he&#39;d have all kinds of other support (healing, speed, protection, you all<br/>
know what I mean).<br/>
