I would kill for a trombone - especially if we had a trombone graphic~!<br/>

If Verant were to implement trombones with graphics we would be obligated<br/>
to get 76 of us together on one server just to march through the most<br/>
populous zones.  Let&#39;s petition for trombones now! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Other instruments Norrath is lacking:<br/>
<br/>
String: Vilia&#39;s Violin - Below a certain string skill level it will reverse<br/>
any healing effects of songs played.<br/>
<br/>
Percussion:  Grand Piano - Weight 500, increases songs by 50%  Throw it<br/>
into a weight reducing pack and only whip it out for the Chants, not the<br/>
travelling songs.  Nothing like raiding The Hole as a pianist &lt;evil grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Wind: Kelin&#39;s Kazoo - increases the knock-back effect of Pixie Strike but<br/>
reverses the effect of Charismatic Carillon, also has a -5 CHA attribute<br/>
and has a strong taunt effect.  Mobs WILL hit you in the face when you play<br/>
this.  So might party members.<br/>
<br/>
Brass:  Archangel Gabriel&#39;s Trumpet - Playing it will bring the server<br/>
down, but wouldn&#39;t it still be cool to have?<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
