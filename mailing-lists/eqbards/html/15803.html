<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262333044">just a side note for anyone that doesn&#39;t know this trick.. Bellow while<br/>
there may be a lot of people that don&#39;t like the song cause its &quot;a bards<br/>
kick&quot; and thats not what bards are for.. Bellow breaks root. The icon<br/>
remains but you can move freely. It also works on other party members.<br/>
Just throwing in my words o wisdom..<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bending down to pick up my stuff, &quot;A Carrion Ghoul hits you for 30! A<br/>
&gt; Carrion Ghoul begins to cast a spell! You are Stunned. You are Rooted!&quot;<br/>
&gt; Everytime I tried to run, I clicked on my corpse again and opened it up,<br/>
&gt; and couldn&#39;t seem to get my view reset.  My girlfriend left the room at<br/>
&gt; this point, sick of the invectives I was throwing at the screen.  So, I<br/>
&gt; die, two feet from my other corpse.<br/>
&gt; All told, 4 deaths, so I head back to BB and camp - time to go play a<br/>
&gt; character who can actually gain experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - there you have it.  Any suggestions before  I delete him?  I think if<br/>
&gt; I can just get to 23rd, things will be much easier, with chains...<br/>

&gt; Talies the frustrated.<br/>
