<div id="ygrps-yiv-407247436">Hymn rate of healing goes up every six levels, for a maximum of 10/20 points<br/>
per tick.  1 point sung, and 2 points with stringed.  12th, 18th, 24th,<br/>
30th, 36th, 42nd, 48th are all Hymn increase levels.<br/>
<br/>
There is no dramatic increase in effect from any bard song level to level.<br/>
It&#39;s subtle, but it adds up.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few notable exceptions.  Lament, levitate, water breathing,<br/>
charm, lullaby, pixie strike, screech, consonant chain, locating lyric, mel.<br/>
motion,  all have a fixed effect or duration that levels don&#39;t increase.<br/>

&gt;&gt;That&#39;s one of the real subtle benefits of the Bard class.  Each and every<br/>
&gt;&gt;one of your songs grows more potent as you level, and never becomes truly<br/>
&gt;&gt;obsolete.  There&#39;s a situation to be found for using each and every one.<br/>
&gt;===========================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;J.M.  Thanks as always for all your great info!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But are you sure that ALL songs improve as you increase level? To be<br/>
honest,<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t done any testing in this arena. Sure, some are obvious (i.e.<br/>
&gt;Bellow damage going up every other level or so, etc). But some songs, like<br/>
&gt;the Healing song, seem to remain the same. Is it a subtle change, i.e. the<br/>
&gt;Healing song heals one more point ever 5 levels? Or is it supposed to be<br/>
&gt;something you notice from level to level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks again,<br/>
&gt;Tim<br/>
