<div id="ygrps-yiv-26383573">Some interesting ideas, but it all devolves down to the basic problem<br/>
that grief players will dedicate way more time to figuring out the<br/>
loopholes in the system than any sane developer can spend or afford to<br/>
pay someone to spend conteracting them.<br/>
<br/>
What really bothers me the most is that people have pretty well<br/>
overwhelmingly shown they don&#39;t like this kind of forced pvp, yet so<br/>
many of the new MMORPG developers seem to remain convinced that they<br/>
have the magic bullet that will convince people that they are wrong to<br/>
dislike it. This reminds me far too much of the same kind of arrogance<br/>
that we&#39;ve seen from Verant, where they quite clearly seem to think<br/>
they&#39;ve made a near perfect game if people would just play it the way<br/>
they were supposed to.<br/>

&gt; Yes, and no.  I don&#39;t think they believe that their PvP environment will be<br/>
&gt; perfect, but they think it will be good.  I like the concept behind it and<br/>
&gt; generally I abhor PvP because it is all about PK for the most part.  Two<br/>
&gt; things they are doing will make a huge difference.  Like the Team PvP<br/>
&gt; servers, only races openly at war can PvP one another without consequence.<br/>
&gt; The big difference is, there will not be a way to tell the difference<br/>
&gt; between PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s on sight.  If you see an Orc on the road ahead and<br/>
&gt; you are an elf, you know that he is dangerous to you, whether he is a player<br/>
&gt; or an npc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Their consequence system is brutal against PK&#39;ers.  If you kill a race that<br/>
&gt; you are not at war with, even a mere 5 or 6 times you will suffer enormous<br/>
&gt; problems.  These problems will include having npc bounty-hunters showing up<br/>
&gt; to kill you at random.  Playing a PK character would rapidly become<br/>
&gt; unplayable as every time you logged in you were ambush by these npc<br/>
&gt; enforcers.  Even if you kept your PK-ing to a race yours was at war with,<br/>
&gt; you would always find yourself in enemy territory where few would feel any<br/>
&gt; compunction against killing you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wasn&#39;t really interested much in Horizons initailly due to it&#39;s PvP<br/>
&gt; system, but they have convinced me to give it a chance.  They feel their PvP<br/>
&gt; system will promote the &#39;risk game&#39; like Player competition while severely<br/>
&gt; punishing to the point of oblivion anyone who PK&#39;s for the joy of hurting<br/>
&gt; others.  Time will tell.<br/>
