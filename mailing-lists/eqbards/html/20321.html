<div id="ygrps-yiv-826617384">So I was camping the mino hero a few weeks ago. To kill time in between ph<br/>
spawns, I was clearing some of the mino caves when I saw the Minotaur Lord.<br/>
For those of you that are unfamiliar with him, he drops a component for SK<br/>
quest armor, the Broken Minotaur Lord&#39;s horn.<br/>
<br/>
When I got this item it looked like a chainmail bracer and I stuffed it in<br/>
the bank thinking that one day I&#39;d make an SK bracer. After the recent<br/>
patches, I noticed that the horn took on a new form and looked like a<br/>
regular mino horn and was brd only, so I equiped it to see if it would work<br/>
as a wind instrument.<br/>
<br/>
End result, a new wind instrument. Why do I care?<br/>
<br/>
Broken Minotaur Lord&#39;s Horn<br/>
Magic Item   Lore Item   No Drop<br/>
+10 vs poison<br/>
weight 2.8<br/>
<br/>
Ok, the weight is a bit high, but the ofset is a nice stat buff AND NO DROP<br/>
status. I&#39;ll do some testing tonight to see if it has a percentage advantage<br/>
as well.<br/>
