<b>Subject:</b> Travelling to Lower Guk to get a Guise <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-369036261">Thats a good idea.  I&#39;m certain that with either my charm or my cash,<br/>
someone will let me loot the Guise.  My main concern though is not getting<br/>
killed while I&#39;m down there.  Any suggestions on how a 24 bard can pull this<br/>
off?  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Step number one, if you get down there and a group is camping the mob that<br/>
&gt; drops the guise<br/>
&gt; (Assassin? I don&#39;t remember) is to just ask if they would mind if you<br/>
&gt; looted it.  Be creative,<br/>
&gt; offer to sing them a song or something in exchange for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chances are, they&#39;re nice people who all have masks anyway and just want<br/>
&gt; to pull Serrated Bone<br/>
&gt; Dirks and they&#39;ll happily let you loot the mask if you entertain them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If they&#39;re jerks about it, then offer to pay.  If it was my group though,<br/>
&gt; we&#39;d happily let you<br/>
&gt; loot it for free.<br/>
