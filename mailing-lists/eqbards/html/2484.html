<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864706088">There&#39;s something else besides this going on in damage calculation.  I <br/>
started a dwarf cleric and twinked him with all of Windsong&#39;s backup armor <br/>
plus a Midnight Mallet that I&#39;d picked up from a troll.  This is a magic <br/>
2hand blunt weapon with damage 14 delay 44.  So it should do up to 29 <br/>
damage per (slow) hit.  The dwarf frequently hits for 18, and (if I <br/>
remember right) occasionally for 19, but I&#39;ve never seen it hit for 20 or <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting about ready to ditch the Mallet for a faster weapon, just <br/>
because it&#39;s not doing as much damage as it should.<br/>
<br/>
The dwarf has strength over 100 and 2H blunt skill over 50 now, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
J. M., if you&#39;re reading this, I&#39;d love it if you would explain what&#39;s <br/>
happening here...<br/>
