<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546841248">I was wondering that myself... I have been in groups<br/>
there as low as 27th lvl... ( I just sang healing to<br/>
them) and i still dont have my guise yet :(  Any way<br/>
as soon as I hit 32 (just 4 bubbles to go)  I have<br/>
some friends who think it is time to get me a mask so<br/>
we will be doing it the old fashioned way... 2 40<br/>
something druids a 40 something warrior and me...<br/>
shouldnt be a challenge (well except for the invis to<br/>
undead is lacking). <br/>
