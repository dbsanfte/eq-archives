<div id="ygrps-yiv-701144095">Sounds fishy, since VI has stated it the past that no items would boost <br/>
skills in the that matter.<br/>
I believe they answered that when Gordon was asked if mechanical lockpicks <br/>
added anything to the lock pick skill and his answer was no and no items in <br/>
the game would add to a skill.<br/>

&gt;i wish i could find it but i can&#39;t now, but what i read from a guildmember<br/>
&gt;of mine who says he spoke with some people at verant, is that all of the <br/>
&gt;PoS<br/>
&gt;quest items have hidden stats that are not shown, so even though the stats<br/>
&gt;may look bad, you are far more effective wearing any PoS item than not.<br/>
&gt;i.e. even though the ranger cloak looks like crap, it can give you a 10%<br/>
&gt;boost to your defense, secretly raising it to 220.  sounds weird but just<br/>
&gt;passing that along.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;we cleared pegs and KoS last night too, dunno our plans for today though,<br/>
&gt;i&#39;m at work or with my baby while they are up there in Sky.  good luck!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m looking forward to completing some of the higher tier<br/>
&gt; &gt; quests in pos.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe the bard and cleric items won&#39;t be as crappy as the ranger ones.<br/>
