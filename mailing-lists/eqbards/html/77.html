 </span></blockquote>Hi Bethmo :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) I&#39;ve seen a few instrument parts for sale.  Is there a trade skill for<br/>
&gt; building instruments?  How is this done?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that they can be built with tinkering, but as I understand it,<br/>
tinkering is mostly broken.  Most likely, building from component parts would<br/>
not be much of a savings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Does it make any difference what instrument you use within a category?<br/>
&gt;  I bought a Mandolin rather than a Lute because it weighs less.  I got a<br/>
&gt; Minotaur Horn right off the head of one of the filthy beasts, and I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; using that for a wind instrument rather than buying one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There may be a difference between magical musical instruments, which I am<br/>
pretty certain exist, but have never seen, and regular musical instruments, but<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that in terms of lute vs. mandolin the only difference is that<br/>
the mandolin is lighter, and the lute is cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Can anyone tell me what &quot;Enthrall & Nix S.&quot; means?  That&#39;s all the<br/>
&gt; description the Strategy Guide gives for the 15th level bard song.  I have<br/>
&gt; tried to figure it out in game, and all I&#39;ve succeeded in is getting myself<br/>
&gt; killed.  It seems to be an area effect that makes every NPC in the area<br/>
&gt; decide to attack me if I&#39;m solo, and I haven&#39;t spotted any effect when<br/>
&gt; turning it on in the middle of a big melee. (Does it bother anyone else<br/>
&gt; that the game doesn&#39;t provide spell descriptions? It makes me really mad.<br/>
&gt; There is no in-character justification for this; the senior-level NPC bards<br/>
&gt; who teach the songs should tell you what they do!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It means &quot;enthrall and eliminate the shit list&quot;.  What that works out to<br/>
operationally is that when you sing the song, it puts the critters to sleep<br/>
until they are attacked again, or until you stop singing the song or until you<br/>
move out of range.  That&#39;s the enthrall part.  The &quot;nix s list&quot; part means that<br/>
if something gets mad at you and attacks you, then you sing the lullaby (and<br/>
they don&#39;t resist), then move away from them, they will forget they were ever<br/>
mad at you.<br/>
<br/>
Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby is one of the bard&#39;s true power songs.  If you and your<br/>
party are being swarmed, it is a total life saver.  Put everything to sleep,<br/>
move away, and those monsters forget they were ever mad at you.   Or, keep them<br/>
all asleep except one, and kill them one at a time.<br/>

&gt; 4) Any information on the &quot;stuck song bug&quot; and how to cope with or prevent<br/>
&gt; it?  I had only experienced this twice before last night.  Last night we<br/>
&gt; killed a named Gnoll and I got a magic axe that casts Berserker Strength,<br/>
&gt; and with that equipped I started getting &quot;stuck&quot; songs every couple of<br/>
&gt; fights.  (Seems to get stuck when the Berserker Strength spell kicks in<br/>
&gt; while I&#39;m switching songs, or something like that.)  The &quot;stuck song bug&quot;<br/>
&gt; symptoms are that you aren&#39;t singing (all song buttons are visible) but it<br/>
&gt; shows a song icon active and gives messages as if you were singing that<br/>
&gt; song. You can click this icon to get rid of it but it comes back again a<br/>
&gt; moment later. Any song that you try to sing ends immediately. It&#39;s like<br/>
&gt; part of the program thinks you&#39;re still singing the song, but another part<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t, so you can&#39;t stop. The only ways I&#39;ve found to cure it are to log<br/>
&gt; out or zone. It sometimes goes away by itself eventually (might be when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; stunned by a monster, not sure).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not certain what causes this.  I think it happens when you get stunned<br/>
while changing songs, but I don&#39;t know for sure.  Aside from the cures you<br/>
mention, if you get stunned again, the problem will go away.<br/>

&gt; 5) I haven&#39;t found the level 14 (Identify) or 19 (Invisibility) songs yet.<br/>
&gt; I thought they were in High Pass, but we got there last night and found<br/>
&gt; only a few songs for sale. (They did have the level 16 water-breathing<br/>
&gt; song, which is GREAT.) They aren&#39;t at the Kelethin, Freeport, or Qeynos<br/>
&gt; bard guilds, and I haven&#39;t heard of any other city with a bard guild. Has<br/>
&gt; anyone found these? (I won&#39;t be level 19 for a while yet, but I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; craving the song.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bard songs are generally found either in the bard guilds (not all bard guilds<br/>
have all the songs, as you&#39;ve discovered by now for sure), Highpass Hold, or<br/>
the library of Erudin.  Very high level songs are on special vendors around<br/>
Norrath, but it&#39;s best to find those on your own.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you,<br/>
