     I keep trying this question looking for some hard info and I&#39;ve <br/>
     noticed some messages flash by (It&#39;s really hard to find time to work, <br/>
     sleep, play EQ, and read all the message on this board. grin) about <br/>
     wanting dex jewelry items so I&#39;m going to ask again.<br/>
     <br/>
     What is better (for a bard, don&#39;t wanna get kaboonged...) Dex or <br/>
     Agility?  The manuals are rather vague on this.  Anyone done any <br/>
     testing?  Empirical evidence?  I have been mostly collecting Agility <br/>
     items based on messages I read in the past.  I personally have not <br/>
     noticed much effect with dex items even though I have a couple.  I&#39;ve <br/>
     spent a lot of money (bard money) on agility items and I hope I <br/>
     haven&#39;t wasted it.<br/>
