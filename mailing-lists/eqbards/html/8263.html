As a male (RL), playing a couple of female characters (aside from being <br/>
fun and amusing) has been educational in an unsettling sort of way.  I <br/>
was soloing a low-level (6 or 7) female human warrior one night, and for <br/>
slightly over an hour, every time I turned around (literally), the same <br/>
male character was following me, hiding behind rocks and trees.  He <br/>
didn&#39;t say anything for about 45 minutes, then started sending suggestive <br/>
tells to me.  I was being stalked!  And, even in the safety of my own <br/>
living room, it felt pretty damned creepy.<br/>
<br/>
Something to think about...<br/>
