<b>Subject:</b> The ONE thing missing in EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-683158862">Ok, Ok, there are several things missing in EQ, but more that anything<br/>
else is this: <br/>
<br/>
	A list of spells and what they do.<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only one who noticed and is frustrated by this? Bards seem to<br/>
be affect less by this than other classes, but they are still affected. <br/>
<br/>
Without the internet sites and other helpful characters, we would never<br/>
know what some of our new songs/spells do(or don&#39;t do). EVERY other RPG<br/>
I have ever played gave you a list of your spells and told you what they<br/>
did (at least in general).<br/>
<br/>
Many bard songs are self-evident, if not by title, then by the first<br/>
time you sing them, some are not so obvious. heck, the best bards on<br/>
this list sometimes argue about the effects of some of our songs, and<br/>
the worst ALWAYS seem to KNOW that the song has some other affect. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the best examples of this come from my other class, the druid.<br/>
At first level, I got &quot;Burst of Flame&quot; and &quot;Flame Lick&quot;, both are<br/>
EVOCATION, both scribe with the little fire symbol. How am I suppossed<br/>
to know what the do? How many bad spells do you have a margin for at<br/>
FIRST level?<br/>
<br/>
I hear people shouting all the time &quot;what does (insert spell here) do&quot;?<br/>
Why should we have to do this? why no spell book detailing the effects<br/>
(or at least saying Level9 direct damage, etc.)?</div>
