&gt;due to the stuck song problem,<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t stay live, I don&#39;t have enough faith in Verant to assume that they <br/>
&gt;won&#39;t put this into production as<br/>
&gt;is), we don&#39;t really know what they intend here.  But I assume that they <br/>
&gt;are attempting to &quot;fix&quot; the<br/>
&gt;&quot;exploits&quot; that exist when a Bard turns on a song and leaves the <br/>
&gt;computer.  If this is the case, it is yet<br/>
&gt;another utterly boneheaded modification to the class that completely <br/>
&gt;ignores game mechanics in general and<br/>
&gt;Bard mechanics in specific.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If an Enchanter casts Clarity on a party, he can sit down to med, and then <br/>
&gt;go smoke a cigarette, or make<br/>
&gt;lunch, or go to the bathroom, or take a quick trip to the hardware <br/>
&gt;store.  When a Bard (as currently<br/>
&gt;coded) turns on Mana song, he can do the same thing.  If this change goes <br/>
&gt;into effect, the Enchanter can<br/>
&gt;still leave, but THE BARD CAN&#39;T.  I can just IMAGINE what my party is <br/>
&gt;going to say if I turn on Mana, go<br/>
&gt;away to stretch my legs, and Mana breaks 5 seconds after I get up.  The <br/>
&gt;same goes for Shamans and trade<br/>
&gt;buffing (an example this poster used).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, it&#39;s possible for someone to log a Bard on, turn on Mana, set him to <br/>
&gt;/follow the Cleric, and have the<br/>
&gt;Cleric get a mana boost that way.  But you can do THE SAME THING with an <br/>
&gt;Enchanter, and you don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;have to split experience with him!  You can do the same thing with ANY <br/>
&gt;buffing class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hell, I&#39;ve been in fights where the Warriors turned on autoattack and then <br/>
&gt;said &quot;AFK&quot;!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In fact, the ONLY thing this really ends up correcting for is parking a <br/>
&gt;Bard in a corner to get instrument<br/>
&gt;skills up.  But I would wager quite a bit of money that there isn&#39;t a <br/>
&gt;single Bard on any server who has,<br/>
&gt;for example, maxed Brass Instruments skill through normal usage <br/>
&gt;alone.  It&#39;s used too rarely, and it goes<br/>
&gt;up much too slowly.  And that and wind instruments are really the only <br/>
&gt;songs we would do this with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do Bards LEVEL too fast?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This doesn&#39;t begin to address what happens when you arbitrarily break <br/>
&gt;group invis (even if the Bard is AT<br/>
&gt;the keyboard) - you&#39;re all visible, and often dead; or levitation (same <br/>
&gt;thing) - you all plummet to the<br/>
&gt;ground; or the level 51 travel song (same thing) - you&#39;re all visible AND <br/>
&gt;you plummet to the ground; or<br/>
&gt;underwater breathing (you have about 30 seconds here) - you all <br/>
&gt;drown.  What a nifty way to render 4 songs<br/>
&gt;utterly useless in one fell swoop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The US Department of Labor says that you should take a break from your <br/>
&gt;computer at least once every half<br/>
&gt;hour or risk serious health complications.  If they really make this <br/>
&gt;change, we&#39;re tied to our computer<br/>
&gt;for the entire time we&#39;re playing this game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Much as I gripe sometimes about their incompentent balancing with regards <br/>
&gt;to Bards, I still like the<br/>
&gt;class, and I hate to have to switch to something else.  Their &quot;play <br/>
&gt;another class&quot; response is really<br/>
&gt;bogus when it takes 40 played days to get a character to a high enough <br/>
&gt;level for me to do things with my<br/>
&gt;quasi-uber-guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do if they make a change like <br/>
&gt;this.  I really can&#39;t see continuing<br/>
&gt;to play my Bard.  And I&#39;m not thrilled with the idea of having to level <br/>
&gt;something else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If they do this, it may be time to quit.  If I don&#39;t get myself banned.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Of course this will make Aria and Clouding instant death songs in many<br/>
&gt; &gt; situations.  I&#39;m hoping this is a bug and not a change or I will be done,<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade skill changes or not.  Maybe I won&#39;t uncancel my account next week<br/>
&gt; &gt; after all, sigh.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just came across this thread in whineplay, which I think all of you <br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; &gt; take a look at.  Evidently there has been a change to the mechanics of bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; song on Test:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It appears that this change is to keep us from indefinitely playing a song<br/>
&gt; &gt; while AFK.  The message received is evidently &quot;Your song ends <br/>
&gt; abruptly&quot;, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; has a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant seems to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; putting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from the <br/>
&gt; keyboard if<br/>
&gt; &gt; we want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the keyboard to <br/>
&gt; keep one<br/>
&gt; &gt; song up as well.  I guess bards dont need bathroom breaks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; All this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>
