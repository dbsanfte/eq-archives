<div id="ygrps-yiv-67221068">It all depends on the number of resists I get with the DDD.  If one or two<br/>
I&#39;m ok, but three or more and I will have to run.  I hit selo&#39;s for a burst<br/>
of speed then slow down until the garg is in bellows range, then twist<br/>
bellows and heal.  Then turn and melee when I&#39;m healed enough.<br/>

I soloed Gargoyles at level 23 With very few mishaps. I twisted COD, DDD,<br/>
and Hymn. at 25 I found I killed the gargoyles faster with weapons (shrug)<br/>
Silvery war axe and Black enameled mace.<br/>
I never had to kite the Gargoyles, but I did run from them once, when I got<br/>
4 of them<br/>

&gt; &gt; meantime I started using Bellow on the first garg.  I found<br/>
&gt; that with Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was moving too fast to stay in range and let Selo&#39;s drop.<br/>
&gt;  It turns out<br/>
&gt; &gt; that gargs fly at the same speed that we run, so I just<br/>
&gt; kept up a normal run<br/>
&gt; &gt; and bellowed until garg number one bit the dust.  I then<br/>
&gt; started in on garg<br/>

&gt; You have become better at kiting (107)<br/>

&gt; I think the question was whether you could do it solo without<br/>
&gt; kiting.  Clearly you couldn&#39;t once you got 2 gargs on you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 23 I almost always had to kite at the end when soloing gargs, even<br/>
with just instruments. Maybe this was because I was just in banded/bronze at<br/>
the time, not much else in the way of armor upgrades. For me, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
until 25 where I could handle single gargs with little trepidation.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, as a courtesy, I usually tried to leave 1 garg on the island before I<br/>
logged off if nobody else was around, since the gargs kill the skeletons.<br/>
<br/>
Also, nice to melee a gargoyle who is fighting a skeleton as the skeleton<br/>
will keep hitting the gargoyle. Just make sure you kill the skeleton before<br/>
killing the gargoyle to ensure the skeleton doesn&#39;t get credited with<br/>
killing the gargoyle. :-)<br/>
