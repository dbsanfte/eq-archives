<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505731799">Well, there&#39;s more out there in the discussion forum world than those two <br/>
mailing lists. I&#39;ve read thru Necromonitor plenty of times (nice heavy <br/>
traffic there), among other sites and tho I think they are whiny, I also <br/>
believe they have plenty to whine about (thx nerf #45696083590 VERANT!). <br/>
Seriously, they should start cataloguing necro nerfs. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t <br/>
start one as I would have probably deleted him by now out of frustration <br/>
with Verant&#39;s &quot;enhancements&quot;. Bards have issues, but not as many because we <br/>
don&#39;t have quite the number of spells at our disposal that could possibly be <br/>
broken, nor do we have a built-in tank to bitch about. The difference is <br/>
when one of our songs is busted our bitching is rightfully magnified by <br/>
virtue that we have only 1 or 2 songs per level compared to every other <br/>
magic-capable class in the game. Anyways, my post was in response to a <br/>
rediculous waste of bandwidth on a stupid subject. Innocent bystanders may <br/>
be harmed in the process.<br/>

&gt;umm i resent that remark. Im subscribed to both the bard and necro mailing<br/>
&gt;list, and well, to make it plain and obvious for you, the bard msg board is<br/>
&gt;way more of a whiny tune then the necro one. And I&#39;ve been a bard way <br/>
&gt;longer<br/>
&gt;then a necro so dont think im saying this because im a necro. I just find<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s more whining on this board, you wouldnt beleive how many threads<br/>
&gt;i&#39;ve deleted sometimes<br/>
