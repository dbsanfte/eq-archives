<div id="ygrps-yiv-500497368">For the longest time I could not figure this out - either.  Sounds like you<br/>
don&#39;t have sneak going successfully.  Yes, you clicked the button, yes it<br/>
grayed out, but probably it&#39;s not sneaking.  Like sense heading, sneak is a<br/>
skill you have to build up.  You can tell when you have a successful sneak<br/>
going because you will change to walking at half speed.  Also, he will sell<br/>
to you &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, keep trying by re-starting sneak until you get a good sneak going then<br/>
get behind him and sell those rusty weps &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Aviak&#39;s have no faction so are immune to Carillon.  Sounds like they have <br/>
have fixed the sneak/sell bug.  Where you behind him when you tried to sell?<br/>

&gt;Last night I tried to sell to Krak, the vendor at the top of the Aviak<br/>
&gt;village in SK. I conned dubious at first and he told me nicely where the<br/>
&gt;exit was. Carillon, with flute or without, would not raise my faction above<br/>
&gt;dubious, and did not change his response. With sneak I got him to<br/>
&gt;indifferent, but he still wouldn&#39;t sell. His response was different, <br/>
&gt;though,<br/>
&gt;saying that he doesn&#39;t talk to Half-Elves, much less sell to them.<br/>
