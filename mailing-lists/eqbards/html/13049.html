<b>Subject:</b> Kelin&#39;s lute and small brass trumpet <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-750961875">Lets assume that Kelin&#39;s lute and the small brass trumpet are in the game<br/>
but according to GZ &quot;you just have to look hard&quot;.  I wonder what you have to<br/>
do in order to be properly &quot;looking hard&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Gonna tell you about something the eqbrewers mailing list tried a few months<br/>
ago.  One of the ingredients for elven wine is morning dew.  Problem is you<br/>
can&#39;t buy morning dew anywhere and no one, including druids and rangers,<br/>
were able to forage it anywhere.  But according to Verant, morning dew was<br/>
included somewhere in the game, brewers just had to &quot;look hard for it&quot;.<br/>
When we got that info from Verant, we developed a systematic plan for<br/>
everyone on the list to try.  Each person volunteered to scour every zone in<br/>
the game in search of morning dew.  Everyone who participated did the<br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Hailed every NPC to see if they gave a bracketed key word.<br/>
2)  If hailing a NPC didn&#39;t produce a bracketed key word, we then asked<br/>
variations of the questions &quot;What about elven wine?&quot; and &quot;What about morning<br/>
dew?&quot;<br/>
3)  Right clicked on every NPC to see if they sold morning dew.<br/>
4)  Rangers and druids (high forage skill) tried foraging in every zone.<br/>
<br/>
Not one of these methods resulted in any information on how to obtain<br/>
morning dew.  I have quit since brewing in the game because all the mouse<br/>
clicking hurt my wrist but as far I as know no one has ever found morning<br/>
dew.  The recipe for elven wine can be found, but no one has ever brewed it<br/>
(to my knowledge).  If morning dew is in the game but hard to find, I think<br/>
the plan we implemented should have found it.  But based on our negative<br/>
results, everyone came to the conclusion that Verant was incorrect in<br/>
claiming morning dew was in the game.  <br/>
<br/>
Now we have GZ telling us that Kelin&#39;s lute and the small brass trumpet are<br/>
in the game but hard to find.  Assuming these are acquired via a quest, I<br/>
would think that trying something similar to what the brewers tried with<br/>
morning dew is the first step to discovering the secret.  I think we can<br/>
rule out these items getting dropped by a mob.  Every mob in the game<br/>
(except Mayong) has been killed so many times by so many people that these<br/>
items would have already appeared by now (assumption on my part).  <br/>
<br/>
Do you guys think a large scale zone search by members of this list is<br/>
warranted?  Anyone have a better idea of how to conduct than steps 1-3<br/>
listed above (substituting the instruments for morning dew)?<br/>

&gt; As anothe side note, GZ said that Kelin&#39;s practice lute and the small<br/>
&gt; brass trumpet are both in the game, you just have to look hard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this another Fiery avenger? I have noticed that a few wierd people sell<br/>
&gt; bardic instruments (Krak in South Karana??) so maybe you need good faction<br/>
&gt; with some of them to get a quest?<br/>
