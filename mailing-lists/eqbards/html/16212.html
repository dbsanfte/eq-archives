<div id="ygrps-yiv-79103337">Monk 45, Ranger 50, Ranger 50, Cleric 50, Me 39 at the time.  The only<br/>
variable was the level 50 Necro vs. the level 50 Wizard... and the level 50<br/>
wizard has a very strong reputation as being a very strong player (although<br/>
also an Item Farmer and Kill Stealer also... 8P ).<br/>
<br/>
To further clarify, the reason that we died was we had the spawns for all<br/>
three camps split up perfectly with the Necro.  When the necro left, it took<br/>
up a lot longer to kill the lord and a wizzie spawned at the end of our<br/>
battle and started to Ice Comet us... starting with taking out the wizard<br/>
(there goes evac :P) followed by the cleric, the rangers and then me...  The<br/>
monk ran, FD&#39;ed and zoned with a quarter bubble left.  In addition, we could<br/>
not re-break the spawn once we complete corpse recovery and the lord and his<br/>
guards had respawned.  With the necro we broke the room by simply waltzing<br/>
in, charming, mezzing and then we slapped the lord around like he was a<br/>
wimpy dervish cutthroat or something... With the wizard we simply couldn&#39;t<br/>
split them up or handle them as a group.<br/>
<br/>
The necro was infinately more productive then the wizard in this group<br/>
camping the Lord/Hand/Magi... and yes, I will attest that a Necro&#39;s ability<br/>
to effect undead and us being in lower guk may have had a lot to do with<br/>
it...<br/>

&gt; Well that&#39;s a poor example.  Two different players can<br/>
&gt; be very differing in ability to play the game.  (Being<br/>
&gt; level 50 does not mean you have any clue at all about<br/>
&gt; EQ is one of my main problems with the game...witness<br/>
&gt; any 50 warriors out there still wearing serp bracers,<br/>
&gt; exe hoods, etc.)  So the necro could have been a very<br/>
&gt; good player and the wizard a very poor player.  Also<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d need to tell me more about the groups involved.<br/>
&gt; If there was no tank then the necro might have been a<br/>
&gt; necessity for his pet.  If you had a good tank and<br/>
&gt; healer and the spawn was broken the wizard should have<br/>
&gt; been just fine.  Yeah yeah i&#39;m rambling on I know I<br/>
&gt; know... :)<br/>
