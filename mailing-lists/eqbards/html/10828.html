 </span></blockquote>  The chances of anyone under level 30 making it in there with invis<br/>
  on a full spawn are slim to none.  Whilst the goblin sage, and the<br/>
  goblin patriarch may be able to see invis.  So do some mendicants,<br/>
  most prelates, and all priests.  A few evokers have also jumped me<br/>
  while invis.  It all depends on your level versus the mob level<br/>
  when it comes down to it.  Sometimes L19 priests see me and attack<br/>
  me, sometimes they dont.  Those goblins will agro on almost anything<br/>
  including L50 players.<br/>
  <br/>
  You&#39;ve got to pass a lot of goblins to get to the throne room.<br/>
  When the dungeon has a good few people in it, and it&#39;s nice and<br/>
  clear, you could probably sail through without incident.  I would<br/>
  assume all goblins can see you until you con each one otherwise.<br/>
  Because once you walk by one scowling goblin, they all jump in.<br/>
<br/>
  Permafrost green casters can kill.  I will not, to this day,<br/>
  walk around freely in there since you never know what may<br/>
  happen.  One priest and two evokers for a melee class is <br/>
  instant death.  I&#39;m not trying to scare people from going in<br/>
  there, it&#39;s just I have an extremely large amount of permafrost<br/>
  experience - and getting lucky sometimes gives people the false<br/>
  pretense that you can stroll in and own a particular place.<br/>

  Harmonic, L14 - L24 in permafrost, most times died in this dungeon.</div>
