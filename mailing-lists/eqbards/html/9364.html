<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030577179">On a similar note this is what happened to me last night, bear in mind<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that my bard is a follower of Erollisi Marr and I have extermely good<br/>
&gt;faction with all wood elves due to the fact that I am a wood elf and I<br/>
&gt;have slayed too many Crushbone orcs to count (from level 3-20).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was on the Sister Isle helping a few friends get a bracer of erollisi.<br/>
&gt;When as usual a pirate spawneed and  attacked one of the sisters.  Seeing<br/>
&gt;this my group mate attacked the pirate and was doing perfectly fine<br/>
&gt;against the pirate.  So I joined in since I was doing nothing wihle<br/>
&gt;waiting for the boat.  Here was a follower of Erollisi and fellow wood elf<br/>
&gt;defending his brethren against an evil pirate.  So I made the mistake of<br/>
&gt;singing Heal, anthem and chain targetting the pirate.  While attacking the<br/>
&gt;pirate I hear some battle cries from the sisters and think that they are<br/>
&gt;going to join us in the battle.  Boy was I wrong they slayed me and then<br/>
&gt;my cleric friend.  Was it me or was something totally wrong with this<br/>
&gt;picture?<br/>

sister when the pirate attacked her, and got waxed by her and the other <br/>
sisters for his trouble.<br/>
