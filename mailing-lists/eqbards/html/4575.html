<div id="ygrps-yiv-901988434">What&#39;s the silliest thing that you&#39;ve done in your EQ travels?<br/>
<br/>
To start, mine was two nights ago..<br/>
<br/>
A fellow Bard and I were walking cautiously through Befallen, sneaking past<br/>
the numerous wandering skeletons and avoiding the sharp diseased teeth of<br/>
the rats that seemed to be at every footstep. We came upon a door. We<br/>
listened and didn&#39;t hear anything from the other side. Apprehensively we<br/>
opened it ever so slightly and peered inside. All clear, it looked safe<br/>
enough. My friend walked in and to the side looking around to make sure<br/>
nothing was hiding. &quot;It&#39;s safe, come on in&quot;, he said. Breathing a sigh of<br/>
relief I walked through the door. *crunch* The next thing I heard was the<br/>
sound of my body hitting the floor. The floor in the room below us. &quot;Ouch!<br/>
Egads! I&#39;ve BEfallen and I can&#39;t get up!&quot; So much for sticking together. We<br/>
both check the hand drawn maps that we purchased from a previous traveler<br/>
and can&#39;t figure out where I happen to be now. While debating as to whether<br/>
we should chance having him come down and join me or me just trying to run<br/>
as fast as I can until I see something that might look familiar, the only<br/>
door in the room opens. My heart stops and fear paralyzes my body as my eyes<br/>
wide with terror watch a nearly dead warrior come through, battered, bloody<br/>
and obviously near death. He looks around the room, looking for an escape<br/>
and I can see the terror in his eyes as he realizes that he&#39;s reached a dead<br/>
end. He turns and screams as 4 mummies and a very upset ghoul come into the<br/>
room after him. Still paralyzed with fear and confusion I can do nothing but<br/>
watch as the undead devour his body and soul. In the middle of the carnage I<br/>
believe my only hope is to try to run past them while they&#39;re occupied, run<br/>
for my life. Sword and shield in hand and cursing the limitations of Selo<br/>
and his now defunct song I make a run for it. A corner here, a hall there, a<br/>
ghoul and a mummy oh my! Finally! The double stairway! I recognize where I&#39;m<br/>
at and keep running. Suddenly I&#39;m stunned and fall to the floor, covered<br/>
with the living undead creatures making my death quick, but very painful.<br/>
<br/>
Let the silliness begin.<br/>
<br/>
I run from Freeport and through the desert back to the entrance of Befallen<br/>
(appropriately named I have come to find out) where my friend meets with me.<br/>
Jokingly he says &quot;Watch that first step, it&#39;s a doozy&quot;. Hrmph. I find my<br/>
poor corpse and retrieve my belongings. Angry and vowing revenge we decide<br/>
to return to the room and press onward. Carefully making our way back<br/>
towards the area and confident because the rooms were empty before, we rush<br/>
forward. *crash* Guess who fell through the floor. Again. *sigh* After<br/>
receiving many curses on my family and my heritage from my friend, I yell to<br/>
him above to go back and meet me on the other side. I decide to try to make<br/>
a run for it before someone brings another group of upset undead into the<br/>
room again. I open the door and there standing before me is a ghoul. With a<br/>
knowing grin on his face waving his finger back and forth in a &quot;No no,<br/>
you&#39;re not going anywhere&quot; motion. I scream my best bellow and run. Run for<br/>
my life.. which ended, very quickly there after. <br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story - Watch that first step, it&#39;s a doozy.</div>
