<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226287003">I&#39;ve been noticing this in Highpass fighting orcs.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all attacking the same mob, so I Lullbay them. (if we get a massive<br/>
spawn).  I count the nods, and sure enough, all the mobs are lulled.<br/>
Obviously the one we&#39;re attackig doesn&#39;t stay lulled, but neither do some<br/>
other ones, even though they&#39;ve got the nod message showing them as being<br/>
sleeping, and keep getting it displayed.  No one is attacking them either,<br/>
no AE spells, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Frustrating, to say the least.  Reduces my crowd control ability immensely.<br/>

&gt; Possible use for lullaby at L17...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A friend on his L17 Bard, and I on my 19 shaman were in East Karana<br/>
&gt; killing gnoll reavers and undead reavers. He&#39;d go pull 2-4 and come<br/>
&gt; back. He&#39;d use lullaby to keep them all asleep except for the one he was<br/>
&gt; attacking. The paladin with us used /assist to target the correct<br/>
&gt; target, then tanked it. At the beginning of the fight, I AE&#39;d the mobs<br/>
&gt; with Infectious Cloud, a Disease AE DoT. Next pulse he&#39;d put them right<br/>
&gt; back to sleep, nixing me off the hate list so I could heal or med<br/>
&gt; without being mobbed. By the time the first target was dead, the other<br/>
&gt; 2-3 targets would have been chewed to half health by the AE everytime.<br/>
&gt; It was quite a sight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Two things to keep in mind however, his stats were much higher than a<br/>
&gt; new player on a L17 because he was outfitted with better equipment, and<br/>
&gt; he&#39;d also played with many bards all the way to L50 in group on his<br/>
&gt; primary character, so he&#39;d been able to see Bards in action and ask many<br/>
&gt; questions about the techniques and tricks of others.<br/>
