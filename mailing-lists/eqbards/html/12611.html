&gt;  1) Lag.  You will be lucky to even get twisting in.<br/>
&gt;     With my P3-450, 128MB, TNT2 Ultra machine with all options<br/>
&gt;     off... detail, pc names, effects, my misses, your misses,<br/>
&gt;     your hits, all spell, all song, I still got lagged something<br/>
&gt;     horrible.  It&#39;s the location server trying to update 30 people<br/>
&gt;     in a very tight area, nothing you can do about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lag can make twisting the stongs very difficult, but i just count 3 seconds<br/>
then twist them. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;  2) You will get more attention than you wanted, starting and stopping<br/>
&gt;     a song draws attention, an adhorrent thought so as it tripled me<br/>
&gt;     for 135.  Cazic Thule thought so when I twisted and he clobbered<br/>
&gt;     me in the 170s.  That said, oh well, you gotta twist, so twist<br/>
&gt;     the right stuff ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would not worry about twisting at all while fighting nagafen. If he hits<br/>
you more than once, then something is seriously, seriously wrong. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  3) Ok, so you are gonna lag and get beat up a little.  You still<br/>
&gt;     need to twist.  Here&#39;s the kicker.  Your COLD/HEAT bonus from<br/>
&gt;     those songs doesn&#39;t do much.  AE Breath will hit for normal if<br/>
&gt;     your resistance is 25 or 125.  Take it for what it&#39;s worth,<br/>
&gt;     and you may not believe it, but it&#39;s confirmed.  Now, you may partial<br/>
&gt;     resist the dmg, but it&#39;s barely accountable to the resist level.<br/>
&gt;     The biggest single problem is the AE fear when doing dragons.  <br/>
&gt;     The best save vs. that fear is being L50... a fear on you even <br/>
&gt;     with MR over 200 at L40 will stick.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This goes against everything we have learned. The cold/heat resistances<br/>
matter greatly. The funny thing is, i didnt think they did either till i<br/>
was showed time and time again. We now have the people who have dragon gear<br/>
(cold/heat jewelry) and those that dont. Those that do live through, those<br/>
that dont, usually do not (unless they are with a bard naturally :). Our<br/>
health bars creep down so slowly with me twisting the two songs vs gettting<br/>
ripped apart if i do not. But i do agree with the level 50 vs lvl 40. Level<br/>
is of utmost importance in this game. I swear almost every calculation in<br/>
the game involves level. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;  4) Your damage counts.  I&#39;ve seen so many people say, Argh!  He<br/>
&gt;     only had a sliver left.  Think if you added your 400 - 500 dmg<br/>
&gt;     into the attack?  You&#39;ve got weapons, use em!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My damage does not count imo, at the point where it could be signifigant,<br/>
nagafen better be dead. I would much rather keep our fatass tanks alive for<br/>
a longer period of time. Course when we fight a dragon we have 2 groups of<br/>
2 clerics, 1 bard, 3 tanks that act as the shield wall for the groups of<br/>
casters behind us. Using this technique, nagafen dies everytime. Or vox. Or<br/>
Inno. Or Cazic. Or Phinny. We as of yet have to find a god/dragon that we<br/>
cant kill with these groups. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are many, many different ways to take a dragon down, but this works<br/>
best for us. Heat and cold do matter imo, you dont NEED it to beat a<br/>
dragon, it just helps cut down the amount of people you need to kill him. <br/>
