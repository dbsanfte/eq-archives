<div id="ygrps-yiv-120626070">Much like the high level cleric earlier today, I have mothballed my 23rd level<br/>
monk.  He&#39;s boring.  The only thing that I miss about him is that he was just<br/>
starting to go into some interesting places.  But the bard will be there soon<br/>
enough...<br/>
<br/>
I started a bard because in getting my monk to 23rd I realized that I always<br/>
enjoyed grouping with bards.  Watching my monk&#39;s HPs rise 8 a tick after a<br/>
battle was very nice...  I thought that they were an interesting class that<br/>
provided very useful buffs.<br/>
<br/>
I was wrong of course.  They&#39;re insanely cool!  I&#39;m having the best time in EQ<br/>
that I&#39;ve ever had with my monk or my 13th level Enchanter.<br/>

&gt; I want to thank all the people posting the great stories today, I really<br/>
&gt; needed a good laugh.  I have no great story myself to add (as I was running<br/>
&gt; all over Tunaria last night looking for medium quality animal skins to<br/>
&gt; practice tailoring on).  But I did hear a funny joke in West Karana:<br/>
&gt; A guy kills a named Barbarian in WK and shouts out &quot;What is a barbarian head<br/>
&gt; good for?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Someone answers, &quot;Nothing, they do not even use them.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keep up the great stories everyone!<br/>
