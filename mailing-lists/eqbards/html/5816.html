<div id="ygrps-yiv-27855662"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So what if my signature file has a few lines of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It may have something to do with your reply of 3 words,<br/>
and then followed by your signature of 41 words. 41 words<br/>
of advertising spam that nobody likes to see regardless<br/>
of the length of your message. If I wanted to find out<br/>
about &quot;great ways to make millions&quot; I could turn off<br/>
the spam filter in my email client and get 50 a day to<br/>
choose from.</div>
