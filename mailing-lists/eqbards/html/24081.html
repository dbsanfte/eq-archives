nothing and adds to our versatility. Every other casting class gets a spell <br/>
that does this as well and it enables you to see without being reliant on <br/>
others or equipment.<br/>

I&#39;m disturbed that anyone try to discount anyone else&#39;s opinions in such a <br/>
sweeping manner. The purpose of this list is to share ideas and strategies <br/>
and I&#39;m generally offended that anyone would say that their opinion is the <br/>
only valid one. I&#39;m glad to hear your opinion, but I would encourage to <br/>
hear from everyone else as well.<br/>

quest and get nice prices in Ogguk and Grobb (with the Mask of Deception). <br/>
If Verant ever pulled this song away from us, I&#39;d definitely quit playing a <br/>
bard. That&#39;s how much this song means to me.<br/>
