<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250975649">No. The charm he refers to is much higher level - it make the mob your pet<br/>
for a short while.  Then you can issue /pet attack and such.  Its really<br/>
funny to see monster fighting each other!  It&#39;s also really confusing with<br/>
multiple monsters and a party that is unaware of the bard or enchanter&#39;s<br/>
ability to charm.  <br/>

to resort to<br/>
		using that song before when someone really got on my nerves<br/>
to clear the<br/>
		damage list and then start bellowing and hitting it as hard<br/>
as I can hoping<br/>
		to finish it off first. As a Bard (15th song) it&#39;s the only<br/>
way I know of to<br/>
		keep something I&#39;m fighting from being stolen. And when<br/>
you&#39;d much rather be<br/>
		playing songs to improve your speed or AC or something,<br/>
that&#39;s a real<br/>
		bummer.<br/>
