<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027392205">Oh.  I blew this one once.  A clerical friend of mine and I were grouped in<br/>
our mid-twenties to kill griffawns in NK one day and I&#39;m speeding around<br/>
looking for some prey.  I stumble across this named ghoul that is wandering<br/>
the plains of NK.  I kinda freak a bit, con it and it&#39;s white or blue to me<br/>
I don&#39;t recall.  Well since I&#39;m fighting with a Cleric I say &quot;INC UNDEAD&quot;<br/>
and punch it in the face.  We kill it pretty easily and it has this &quot;Bag of<br/>
Troll Guts&quot;.  Well I too remembered the quest given in Qeynos so I ask for<br/>
and receive the bag.  So later that night I jet down to Qeynos and give the<br/>
bag to the female in the bard guild that is looking for Troll Gut for<br/>
strings.  She says &quot;Thank you&quot;, and that&#39;s all.  Then I realized later DOH!<br/>
I never tried right clicking on it to open the damn thing.  Is it a 4 slot<br/>
container with troll guts in each slot?  After all it&#39;s called a BAG of<br/>
troll guts.  I&#39;ve been kicking myself ever since.  Try right clicking on it<br/>
to see if it will open like a backpack.  I&#39;m dying to know.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall her name, but the person is the vendor in the middle of the<br/>
lefthand wall when you enter the Qeynos guild hall.  If you&#39;re patient you<br/>
can sit in the guild hall and hear the NPCs having a discussion along the<br/>
lines off &quot;Shhh..  don&#39;t tell soandso what his strings are made of.&quot;  Hail<br/>
her, ask about the strings and you&#39;ll start the conversation.<br/>

&gt; A friend of mine handed this to me, said it was off some rare NPC in North<br/>
&gt; Karana.  I remembered once hearing someone in the Qeynos guild asking for<br/>
&gt; some strong trollgut to fashion strings, but I can&#39;t find the person who<br/>
&gt; asked anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone can pass on information regarding to finishing this quest, I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; happily let everyone know when I&#39;m rewarded with a rusty short sword.<br/>
