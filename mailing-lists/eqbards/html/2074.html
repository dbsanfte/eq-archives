<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240862248">Took me 2 lvs (from lv 27 to 29) to raise piercing from nill to 150.  I used<br/>
the dragoon dirk and a FS rapier.  I was fighting reds and yellows, so that<br/>
may have sped it up a little bit.  At 29, I picked up 2 FS warhammers and am<br/>
trying to raise 1H blunt.  I&#39;m just a bubble into 30 now and my 2H blunt is<br/>
only 20 or so, so it&#39;s taking quite a bit longer for 1H blunt.  I do however<br/>
find that getting up to about 10 takes forever, and from then on you are<br/>
likely to get consistent improvements.<br/>

&gt;point onward ? and 2) because pierce isn&#39;t the bards intial attack type ,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;perhaps its preffered weapon type ( is that worded ok?? , it might not be )<br/>
<br/>
&gt;does it make piercing harder to learn than 1h slash ??<br/>
&gt;Ok , many thanks .<br/>
