<div id="ygrps-yiv-468565023">can you put this arrow in the ammo slot and keep normal ones in inventory?<br/>
<br/>
on my monk at least, the last ammo is never taken.  if it&#39;s down to 1 on<br/>
ammo it starts pulling from inventory.  of course, i only have shurikens on<br/>
my monk so i don&#39;t know how mis-matched ammo types would work.<br/>
<br/>
pure shame skipping stones in swamp of no hope aren&#39;t stackable with their<br/>
200 range.  those would be great for pulling for just about any class.<br/>
<br/>
i know, we have ranged songs, but when i tag something to pull i want it to<br/>
come NOW instead of when the song finally starts :)<br/>

I will take a look tonight, but I believe that the Shardwing Arrow is<br/>
All/All.<br/>

Only thing is that it is Lore =)</div>
