&gt; Now I do not know about the song affecting the dmg but it<br/>
&gt; seems that they must have increase the MOB hit factor<br/>
&gt; because I noticed the same thing these past 4 days.  I am<br/>
&gt; lvl 23 now but I was lvl 22 the whole last week.  I used<br/>
&gt; to kill gorge hound with ease from lvl 20 to 22 but<br/>
&gt; somehow now they are hitting me really hard at max dmg.  <br/>
&gt; I have full bronze since lvl 18.  The only thing that was<br/>
&gt; changed in my armor since the past 4 days is that I got a<br/>
&gt; BS Mantle and a elf-hide glove.  My str is 95, my dex is<br/>
&gt; 107, and my agi is 108.<br/>

in Highpass were green to me at L19, and they suddenly became<br/>
blue after a patch (which wasn&#39;t too bad since it meant I<br/>
didn&#39;t have to find new hunting grounds for a couple more<br/>
levels).<br/>
