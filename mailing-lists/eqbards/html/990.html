<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551865214">Hello again,<br/>
     <br/>
         I&#39;m on the digest diet so my messages will always be multipart:<br/>
     <br/>
     1.  Thanks for all the feedback on the Lull song.  Tried it last night <br/>
     and it worked great.  I&#39;m lazy and hate doing the instrument/weapon <br/>
     swap (Unless I&#39;m running that is... a giant can be very motivating :))<br/>
     so after I killed one goblin I just renewed the song on the other two <br/>
     etc. repeat.  It&#39;s a fast spell so this is easy. <br/>
     <br/>
     2.  I have heard that Wisps can drop great loot (lightstones) but you <br/>
     need a magic weapon.  What is the easiest/cheapest magic slashing 1h  <br/>
     weapon that I can lay my hands on? <br/>
     <br/>
     3.  Throwing weapons....  I have been thinking about trying these for <br/>
     some time.  (Poor mans fetch spell)  Can you ever recover the dagger <br/>
     after you use it or is it lost for good?  Seems expensive if you have <br/>
     to replace them every time. (1s+ each)  Do they attract the mob even <br/>
     if you miss?  (funny image of dagger flying past the nose of Mooto the <br/>
     Goblin followed by a yawn.)<br/>
     <br/>
     4.  For Rolande:  I have been hunting in Misty Thicket near Revervale. <br/>
     You can earn about 2p an hour if you really hump.  You&#39;re to high to <br/>
     earn any experience there however.  Sounds like Paw might be a good <br/>
     choice.  BTW I only have 2 smaller pieces of banded that I got a great <br/>
     discount on (guy was tried and wanted to go to bed) and even then I <br/>
     had to borrow money from my partner.  (Just paid him back so I&#39;m flat <br/>
     broke now.)<br/>
     <br/>
     5.  Where does the Amulet of Order quest start?  Don&#39;t need any <br/>
     spoilers just a starting spot unless it is ridiculously hard.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks again for the information.  This list is amazing!<br/>
