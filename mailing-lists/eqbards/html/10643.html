<div id="ygrps-yiv-978867618">I have noiticed this too, recently.  It was fine for a while, but now that<br/>
problem is back.  I used to get my own posts back within 3 or 4 minutes of<br/>
posting them, but now sometimes I wait a few days.<br/>
<br/>
I hope they fix whatever is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m suspecting they just don&#39;t have enough horsepower for the amount of<br/>
traffic at Onelist, now.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone else receive responses to posts before they get the actual<br/>

before I get the original post and can figure out what is being discussed...<br/>

&gt; Also, I&#39;ve noticed that some posts of mine come back throught right away,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>while others I have posted take days...<br/>
