&gt; around the gears killing potential placeholders but have never gotten him to<br/>
&gt; spawn.  Additionally, I have read the hero is level 35 - does anyone think<br/>
&gt; it is possible to solo him at level 40 or does he hit like a giant?<br/>

a rare spawn and appeared immediately after you killed<br/>
Meldrath (who was mid-20s and his mino guards were 30ish).  <br/>
After the quest armor went in, one of the ranger quest items<br/>
went on Meldrath.  Verant was smart enough to figure out that<br/>
all the rangers killing Meldrath for the quest causing the<br/>
hero to spawn would cause (A) lots of dead newbies, and/or<br/>
(B) lots of people with hero bracers.  So they changed it so<br/>
the hero no longer spawns when you kill Meldrath.  (They also<br/>
upgraded Meldrath to mid-high 30s, and lowered the mino guards<br/>
to 20s.)<br/>
<br/>
So yes, he used to spawn when Meldrath was killed.  But he<br/>
doesn&#39;t anymore.<br/>
