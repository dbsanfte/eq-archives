<br/>
1) run song got stuck on, as they sometimes do.<br/>
<br/>
2) kerrans killed me while I was on the boat (didn&#39;t see them<br/>
   go on the boat, but they did attack me even when I was on the<br/>
   top part).  I think they did the ignore-Z thing and attacked<br/>
   from the ocean floor.<br/>
<br/>
Found my body at the bottom of the sea...<br/>
<br/>
My wizard friend found it amusing to watch me run round and round<br/>
the island, /telling me with the lap delay like a race-car driver...<br/>

	OK, the&#39;re 5 seconds behind you...<br/>

Moral:  Don&#39;t kill the kerran beetles.</div>
