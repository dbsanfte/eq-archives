<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713672630">No... i think you are dead on. Verant has probably screwed up again. But i<br/>
didnt even have enough energy to to scream more about the 54/23 nerf... just<br/>
getting rapidly fed up with all the crap =(<br/>
<br/>
Gendal Concorden, lvl 55... and almost 56 but who cares cause 56&#39;s songs<br/>
suck. Who has time to check what time it is in Norrath everytime they want<br/>
to use a song? And its not even like the frickan songs are all that usefull<br/>
anyways. Sigh... ok.... 57 looks usefull but thats a whole lvl away :(<br/>

<br/>
&gt; i really thought i would have gotten more interest in this, and maybe<br/>
&gt; sparked verant to look at it, so i have a question about all this... do<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; think i am wrong? am i just comlaining? or does no one really care at this<br/>
&gt; point? are there a lot of bards here hunting in sebilis and hoping for<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; new armor? well, if you want the thread again here it is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; i just want to have the same chance as all the other classes at the new<br/>
&gt; armor set from kunark that we are all entitled too, and what i have come<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; believe at this point does not exist.  could it be the quest?  maybe but i<br/>
&gt; doubt it.  every single other class has their pieces drop in sebilis, why<br/>
&gt; have bards quest for it?  oh well...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shada, 54.8 Bard<br/>
&gt; Mith Marr<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My guess, and it ties into the Burynai Bunt Cake quest<br/>
&gt; &gt; that we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; figgered out yet, is that the helm that Treekill gives as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reward is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Singing Steel Helm. His talk says that he got it from a bard,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the helm<br/>
&gt; &gt; is only usable by bards, and that the bard said it came from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sebilis where<br/>
&gt; &gt; all of the class helms are coming from that I know of.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If the quest for the cake turns out to be quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; elaborate and time<br/>
&gt; &gt; consuming then I can see Verant putting this as the reward.<br/>
