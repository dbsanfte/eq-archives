<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891466858">I&#39;d love to know how you solo&#39;d effectively at levels 18-22.  For me the few<br/>
times I tried it was death unless I could find a blue &quot;oracle&quot; type caster.<br/>
No chains, No fear.  Sure DDD, and CoD do decent damage but avoiding adds<br/>
was impossible nearly at that level range.  Now had Lullaby been working I<br/>
imagine I could have pulled it off, but those levels were horrific for me<br/>
because it was basically:<br/>
<br/>
Log on, do /w friends all, /w armigers all.<br/>
If no one in my area, Log off and log on as secondary.<br/>
<br/>
I found that soloing those levels was nigh on impossible, and grouping with<br/>
pickup groups was even more suicidal.  Invariably I&#39;d die 3 or 4 times and<br/>
end up barely breaking even for the evening.  Biggest problem for me at<br/>
those levels was that if anyone in the group screwed up, the instant result<br/>
was 1 dead bard.  Didn&#39;t matter what the screwup was, bad pull, out of<br/>
control pet, linkdead tank, etc. End result was 1 dead bard and possibly 1<br/>
or 2 other deaths.<br/>
<br/>
Soloing at 27+ has been possible, even fairly comfortable, but that long<br/>
stretch from 18th to 23rd was painful.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; First of all, it&#39;s bad players, not bad classes.  Period.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YUP!!!  Agreed 100%<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you take a Bard who&#39;s soloed his way to 50 (/laugh), I&#39;d be willing to<br/>
&gt; bet he&#39;s not a very good group player.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually the Bard is the 2nd or 3rd best Solo Class.  Especially after level<br/>
26 and 27.  And even before that you can easily solo any blue with a well<br/>
played bard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, Mage&#39;s, Necro&#39;s, Druids<br/>
&gt; all have a slight disadvantage in that they can solo, so they might<br/>
&gt; not pick up the group acceptable behaviors along the way, while Bards<br/>
&gt; are generally forced to group and thus forced to figure out HOW to<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above.  Bards are, hands down, one of THE best solo classes in the game.<br/>
We are also one of the best GROUP classes.  My bard can out-solo a magician<br/>
any day of the week until a magician hits level 40 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Your points are valid regarding players who solo rather than group.  However<br/>
I dissagree that casters have a harder time learning to solo.  Bards are<br/>
easily as powerful (and in many cases far more powerful) as any caster at<br/>
Solo play except perhaps the Necromancer and Druid classes yet we learn to<br/>
operate in groups just fine.  Many people, even bards, don&#39;t realize just<br/>
how powerful we are as a Solo class.   Even Druids and Necros have a hard<br/>
time soloing hill giants.  Yet a bard can do it easily enough starting at<br/>
around level 30 if we have 2 giants.<br/>
<br/>
I agree completely that it&#39;s the player, not the class, that makes ANY<br/>
character good, or bad, in a group.  I have grouped with good magicians, bad<br/>
magicians and the whole range in between.  Same goes for EVERY other class<br/>
in the game, including bards.  In fact, I&#39;d honestly say, I&#39;ve met more bad<br/>
bard players than any other class barring Necros.  (And they DO have a<br/>
harder time learning to group because nobody wants a necro -until recently-)<br/>
