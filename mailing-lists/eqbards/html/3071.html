<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373503819">Actually, with my L7 Bard (I remade her and my new Bard is just L5), she<br/>
was often told what songs the group wanted &quot;twisted&quot; when she joined.<br/>
About 50% of the time a group seems to expect the Bard to be twisting.  The<br/>
other 50% is often a group that didn&#39;t know what a Bard did ... or they<br/>
never have considered startegy for any of thier members (run!).  She has<br/>
been both enthusiastically welcomed, and booted because she wasn&#39;t twisting<br/>
(read my hands got tired twitching) fast enough for thier expectations.  <br/>
<br/>
Sure, leave a bad group.  But good groups expect Bards to twist.  I<br/>
actually have no problem with that .. but .. I can&#39;t handle more than 1 to<br/>
1 1/2 hour of the &quot;twitch&quot; motion required.  Its further compounded by the<br/>
fact that for RP reasons my Bard is more a singer than a fighter.  <br/>
<br/>
If Bards are suposed to &quot;twist&quot; or stack songs, it would be nice to have it<br/>
built in to the interface to do so without wrist-endangerment.  We would<br/>
still be finger active anyway to switch instrument/weapon and I would<br/>
expect one-shot (non-persistent) songs like Bellow to still be hot-key<br/>
driven.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess its the difference between a single shot effect, and a persistent<br/>
buff type effect.  A low level cleric can cast Holy Armor and Courage<br/>
(stacking with one key stroke each), they&#39;re stacked, he&#39;s done typing.<br/>
The Bard however cannot stack without continuous keystrokes (the twitch<br/>
part I take exception to).  If we&#39;re supposed to stack persistent songs ...<br/>
give us a mechanism that isn&#39;t &quot;twitch&quot; driven to do so.  Or stop<br/>
advertising that this isn&#39;t a twitch game.<br/>
