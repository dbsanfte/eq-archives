lair. Those shrooms guard the caves down there, along with Sebilite<br/>
Protectors and some very high level frogs. There&#39;s no way in hell they<br/>
should be agroing up by the bridge area.<br/>

if you jump off the first bridge you hit on the way in and swim down to<br/>
the end of the right side water area, you can swim down a tunnel that<br/>
takes you to a jail filled with high level frogs. There&#39;s a passage down<br/>
there that will take you into the cave area and on to Trak&#39;s lair. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t advise trying this without a high level multi group party, and<br/>
we haven&#39;t done it since the patch so it may be even harder with the<br/>
random mob warping we are seeing now.<br/>
