<br/>
&gt; Well, last night I ran a small test to see if the third number in the /loc<br/>
&gt; does indeed mean the z-axis problem is fixed.  I grouped with a guildmate<br/>
&gt; and had her go to the top of the ramp to the Paladin guild in FV.  I then<br/>
&gt; ran down the bank to the base of the tower so that I was directly<br/>
underneath<br/>
&gt; her.  I then played HoR.  She felt no affects.  I then ran about 1/2 way<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; the bank and had her walk down the ramp.  Still no affects.  It wasn&#39;t<br/>
until<br/>
&gt; I came back up to her level that her wounds started healing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FYI,<br/>
