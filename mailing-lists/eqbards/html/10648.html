<br/>
1: Evil-Eye bag<br/>
2: Large bag<br/>
3: Handmade backpack<br/>
4: Greater Lightstone<br/>
5: Instrument<br/>
6: Instrument<br/>
7: Instrument/weapon<br/>
8: Weapon<br/>
<br/>
With instrument in 7, I have access to all four quickly from hotkey panel<br/>
2.  With weapon, I have access to 3 instruments and 2 weapons.  The<br/>
10-slot backpack is great for keeping the multitude of foraged goods, and<br/>
the EE bag allows for ~40p of FS weaps to be harvested.  The lightstone is<br/>
for my humanity.  If I can find something else that emits light (does the<br/>
Runed bone fork?), I&#39;d happily give up my lightstone.  Till then though,<br/>
it&#39;s got a permanent place in my inventory.<br/>

rather strongly under the assumption that it did, I relate myself to a<br/>
caster in a very minor context, only that my songs do things in similar<br/>
ways as their spells (DD, DoT, buff, ..), but there are so many<br/>
differences between me and them, I tend to let them do their job, and me<br/>
mine.<br/>
