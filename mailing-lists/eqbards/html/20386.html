<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-214632649">Our guild hadn&#39;t been doing planes since Kunark and recently we went back.<br/>
<br/>
We used to do &quot;suicide run-in&#39;s&quot; (singles or pairs would run in and try to<br/>
make the safe spot and camp-out.)  But now, we buff up, invis and do<br/>
&quot;standing breaks.&quot;  We get like 3 groups ready and zone them in with 20-30<br/>
second intervals to avoid crashing the server.  Then fight whatever is there<br/>
until we get it cleared.  PoF we usually move the the west wall (50 feet<br/>
from portal.)  PoH we just clear then pull to the zone-in and dont bother<br/>
with the SW or North of SW spots any more.  It&#39;s a far cry from when we were<br/>
maxxed at level 50.   Having folks 52-57,58 & 59 even makes a great deal of<br/>
difference.  &quot;Dont kill that!  He&#39;s giving us mana!~&quot;  as the &#39;chanters are<br/>
mana tapping mezzed mobs, heh.<br/>
<br/>
And then last night, I got asked to do the Efreeti in nag&#39;s lair with some<br/>
friends and friends of friends.  I agreed under the condition that I could<br/>
be the puller - hehe.  I was the highest level at 52 and we had a 52 SK.<br/>
One 51 and the rest were 48, 49 and 50&#39;s for the 11 folks there.  I planned<br/>
on using Lament and getting singles.  The first group of imps were closely<br/>
stacked and all 4 of them came.  They got mezzed by the chanter and<br/>
fortunately the melee folks were able to assist the picker (the 52 SK.)  I<br/>
guess they had never seen 4 imps all at once - up close and personal like<br/>
but they did well and we mowed threw them all.  I had better luck pulling<br/>
the next set and got separation using lament.  We rushed the Freeti room and<br/>
had no trouble there as well.   Pretty good work for a &#39;pick-up&#39; group.<br/>
Aside from 2 guildies (one was the SK and the other was playing her<br/>
Sha-person secondary char), I had never met the rest of these folks.<br/>
<br/>
So anyways, what makes it relavent, is the comment I heard from them:<br/>
&quot;Resisted!  Damn it, nothings sticking!  Resisted again!&quot;  And all because<br/>
of the level differences fighting even and higher cons vs fighting blues.  I<br/>
have to keep reminding myself as I cruise through Burning Wood: &quot;Yes, it&#39;s<br/>
blue but blue can be level 51 and he can summon you - that Gullierback, yes<br/>
he can.&quot;<br/>

&gt; breaking in is a different story, i hope you are going with some<br/>
experienced<br/>
&gt; groups.<br/>
