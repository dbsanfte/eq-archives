<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923744909">i play my warrior and wizard at the same time.  it&#39;s not that hard.<br/>
warrior makes a pull, wizard hits assist key, nuke, sit down, nuke<br/>
sit down, etc.  i wouldn&#39;t want to do this with a secondary character<br/>
who was doing anything but assisting tho.<br/>

&gt;dicey, or a monk who pulls, feigns, and doesn&#39;t get up again until it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;time to make another pull. &lt;/shrug&gt;  Any class played that way is a waste<br/>
&gt;of the class, but still, maybe the group really, really, wants that<br/>

&gt;Hehe...the loot fairy is welcome to visit me while I&#39;m away.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My only question is, how can a person play more than one character at a<br/>
&gt;time<br/>
&gt;effectively?  Yesterday in Dalnir, I was doing CC (heh...it&#39;s weird being<br/>
&gt;high enough level to say this) for my group, and it was more than enough to<br/>
&gt;keep me busy.  There is no way I could have played, say, a warrior at the<br/>
&gt;same time, at least not effectively, much less a class that takes more<br/>
&gt;situational awareness, like a chanter or cleric (or a bard.  :)  ).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would be hesitant to be in a group where the same person was trying to be<br/>
&gt;2 classes in the same group/raid.  Especially in high risk, multiple mob<br/>
&gt;dungeons, where not even Selos has a chance to save my hide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sounds like things have worked out, though.  That&#39;s always a good thing.<br/>
&gt;:)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To answer some questions:<br/>
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;I&#39;m a little confused by a couple things.  Were all people in both<br/>
&gt;groups in your guild? [Yes everyone in both groups is technically in our<br/>
&gt;guild] And 2 of the people (including the tag-along<br/>
&gt;Enchanter) were being played by your guild leader? [ The guild leader is<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Queen and her husband the king were both playing 2 characters each. She was<br/>
&gt;playing the second L44 enchanter and her shaman and the king was playing<br/>
&gt;his<br/>
&gt;warrior and a cleric] &quot;Walk on the<br/>
&gt;guild&quot; means leaving the guild? [Yes I mean leave the guild. Our guild is<br/>
&gt;based on the chivalric values and while this was hopefully only a momentary<br/>
&gt;lapse of clear reasoning, I wanted them to see just how seriously we<br/>
&gt;considered this issue.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to rules, we have loot rules to this effect that the king wrote that<br/>
&gt;primaries get first cut. We discussed this at the time with several<br/>
&gt;guildmates and some were kinda divided over the rightness of it. I guess<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;mudding factor was the chanter was actually there. We&#39;re a fairly small<br/>
&gt;guild nowadays and this is the first disagreement over loot we&#39;ve had. I<br/>
&gt;really think it wasn&#39;t greed as much as it was them having been too<br/>
&gt;insular.<br/>
&gt;The king has an odd work schedule (doctor) and so they have never been<br/>
&gt;involved in Planes raids or high level dungeon raids with anyone else. We<br/>
&gt;tend to hang with other guilds like Venator Sapentia as we have several<br/>
&gt;dual<br/>
&gt;guilded or ex&#39;excal friends in VS and so we get out more you might say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to multiples, we currently own 4 accounts: we&#39;ve had friends quit with<br/>
&gt;decent level characters and so we took over the account in one case and<br/>
&gt;added the third just prior to that for bankspace mostly. We have a 3rd pc<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;our office in easy reach of either of us so we do play up to 3 lower level<br/>
&gt;characters at once usually wizard, necro, and a healer. We play with our<br/>
&gt;friends alternates who are similiar level and there&#39;s never any issue over<br/>
&gt;loot. We have a third generation of characters started and nearing their<br/>
&gt;20&#39;s now as well. It proves we&#39;re addicted of course but it&#39;s given us a<br/>
&gt;chance to try out alot more character types; we&#39;ve probably got one of<br/>
&gt;everything at this point. I do think there are classes and places where<br/>
&gt;playing 3 characters is not a good option. A couple of our friends have<br/>
&gt;gotten second accounts from friends or family members as well so now we<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;an address book of account names and passwords so we can move people and<br/>
&gt;items at will. Imagine the surprise of our 40s ranger friend when he logs<br/>
&gt;back on Saturday to find he&#39;s wielding Yaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for your comments everyone, I wanted a reality check from some 3rd<br/>
&gt;parties and I appreciate the input.<br/>
