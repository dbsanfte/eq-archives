Nope, your 2HS is forever stuck at 1.  However you will find that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
make as much difference as you would think it should until post 20th.<br/>
Offense plays a much bigger role in determining if you hit or not and so<br/>
does level.  I tested as a 10th level warrior with an offense and 1hb of 10<br/>
and hit considerably more often on the same mobs as a 3rd level warrior with<br/>
those same skill levels.  And yes getting a warrior to 10th level without<br/>
raising his offense skill was a pain in the keister.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Giant Grub Digger<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi!<br/>
<br/>
This guy just gave me a Giant Grub Digger (12dam/47dly, +20HP, +5 <br/>
SVDisease), *2HS* weapon that can be wielded by bards!  Now, last <br/>
time I visited the Bard Guild, my trainer didn&#39;t offer me 2hs as a <br/>
skill, and I&#39;ve always heard that 2HS is not available to bards <br/>
anyway, YET I can and have wielded this thing!  In truth, using this <br/>
is not as effective as my Drachnid Leg Tip, but I think it&#39;s because <br/>
Bards are NOT ABLE to increase their 2HS skill.  Also, the only time <br/>
I do any REAL damage (25-28 per hit!) is when I&#39;m whistling the war <br/>
song, otherwise I rarely hit above 10.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any information on this?  Have any bards been able <br/>
to establish and improve a 2HS skill?  If so, bards just got a GREAT <br/>
soloing weapon!<br/>
