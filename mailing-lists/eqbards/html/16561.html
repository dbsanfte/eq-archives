 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been fear/chaining giants to finish them off since my<br/>
late 30s.  The bigger problem is fear wearing off early, not<br/>
chain.  I had problems chaining GKs in my mid 30s, but that<br/>
pretty much went away in my high 30s (SKs took a bit longer).  <br/>
At 49, I can do a Chain/Screech/CoC weave on a giant and<br/>
except for the initial hit, I stand a pretty good chance of<br/>
never getting hit.  Again, the main problem is that fear wears<br/>
off early, not the Chain.  It does break chain from time to<br/>
time, but that&#39;s the exception not the rule.<br/>
