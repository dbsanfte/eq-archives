<b>Subject:</b> Anyone notice the lack of bashing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995325910">I gave Raiel the heads up on this after I noticed it in the<br/>
patch.  I have only been bashed once since the patch, and that<br/>
was by an enchanter animation (with a shield).  Raiel says<br/>
he&#39;s only been bashed by ogre guards in Najena, and ogres are<br/>
supposed to have it as a innate ability.<br/>
<br/>
You think they finally fixed it so the bash limitations are<br/>
the same for mobs as for players?<br/>
