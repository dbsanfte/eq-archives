<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402224839">I&#39;d like to know how you are able to sing the invis song to get past the<br/>
guards in evil cities.  How do you get your spare flute (required to sing<br/>
invis song) out of the bank? The only way I could see this scenario working<br/>
is if you were bound at the bank of the evil city and the banker/guards in<br/>
the bank don&#39;t attack you on sight.  I have always assumed this was not a<br/>
viable option for non-evil races because the banker and guards in the bank<br/>
would attack you on sight before you had a chance to get your flute.  <br/>

&gt; die, we can invis past the guards, we can use our sneak ability (rogues<br/>
&gt; have it even easier because they can sneak and hide at the same time) or<br/>
&gt; with Selo&#39;s we can attempt to even just run right past them to the nearest<br/>
&gt; zone (you might get whacked a time or two as you go speeding past though).<br/>
