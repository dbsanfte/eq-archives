<div id="ygrps-yiv-526804910">definitely true.  and you are right, i never have charm memmed anymore, SoT<br/>
is in its place.  usually i am not in places where i can charm, and when i<br/>
am i prefer SoT since it is a definite 18 seconds, no early breaks, nothing<br/>
beating on me if i miss the recharm and needing a heal from someone,<br/>
together i think outweighs the extra damage my pet would be doing, since i&#39;m<br/>
usually in a fast-killing group.  and like i said, a lot of the stuff i am<br/>
fighting for exp now is uncharmable and even unmessable.  i used the hell<br/>
out of charm pre-velious and pre-SoT fix.<br/>
<br/>
song line-up changes a lot, and i am lazy in exp groups since we are usually<br/>
never in danger and on single pulls, so i know i could be doing a lot more<br/>
and if there is any danger i&#39;ll fire up what&#39;s needed.  my line-up in a<br/>
normal exp group, which is usually tank heavy, is the following.  i switch<br/>
out 3,4,5 or whatever for the 3 chants if a caster group or solo.  lately i<br/>
have been singing a single chant for the of extra damage, dunno why i never<br/>
did it before (see laziness above).  should have been doing it ever since i<br/>
got my SSS.<br/>
<br/>
1) Selo&#39;s (changes to Invis or Lull indoors)<br/>
2) Cantana (never changes)<br/>
3) Song of Dawn (changes to Resist song #2 or chant if needed)<br/>
4) McVaxius Rousing Rondo (never changes)<br/>
5) Occlusion of Sound (changes to Resist song #1 or chant if needed)<br/>
6) Song of Twilight (never changes)<br/>
7) Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding (never changes, been using 23 chains forever<br/>
because when i first got 51 binding i thought i remember it being a lower<br/>
slowdown)<br/>
8) Screech (never changes, see below)<br/>
<br/>
any of the songs that are not &quot;never changes&quot; of course i can swap out for<br/>
any rarely used or situational song i may need, e.g. charimsatic carillion.<br/>
as far as #8 Appaling Screech, i really need to rethink this.  i am never in<br/>
an area anymore where this song will not be resisted by everything i sing it<br/>
on.  it used to be such a handy song, but with the fear cap i need something<br/>
else here, any suggestions?<br/>

&gt; to result in a large<br/>
&gt; difference of our views on the class.  for example while most <br/>
&gt; of us consider<br/>
&gt; charm a staple song, you probably don&#39;t even have it memmed <br/>
&gt; most of the<br/>
&gt; time, right?  actually it would be kind of interesting to see <br/>
&gt; what your &#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39;<br/>
&gt; song list does contain, if you don&#39;t mind giving out that info, heh. </span></blockquote></div>
