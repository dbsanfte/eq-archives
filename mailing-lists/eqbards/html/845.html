<div id="ygrps-yiv-132929398"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, too many people seem to think that this is<br/>
&gt; &gt; the UPPER limit as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By definition, the upper limit has to be the same as the lower<br/>
&gt; limit, since a L40 grouping with a L31 (-9 levels) is also a<br/>
&gt; L31 grouping with a L40 (+9 levels).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must not have been clear, I mean that the lower threshold for people<br/>
grouping together seems to be 3 levels of difference, and that some<br/>
people, unfortunately, think that it is also the upper limit, meaning<br/>
that 3 is always the greatest distance between party members allowable.<br/>
Which is, of course, not the case.<br/>
