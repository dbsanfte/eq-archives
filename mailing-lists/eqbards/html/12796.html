Subject: [eqbards] A new /who command (OT)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Here is an idea I posted on alt.games.everquest newsgroup.  The few replies<br/>
&gt;it generated were all positive.  Let me know what you think and maybe it is<br/>
&gt;something else we can post on the official EQ message board.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to see a new /who command added to the game.  The command<br/>
 </span></blockquote>would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;work like this.  You type in /who &quot;zone name&quot; and it tells you who all is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that zone.  As it stands right now, you can only find out who is in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>zone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you are currently in.  This command would be a tremendous benefit to every<br/>
&gt;player in the game, especially those without teleport and gate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>capabilities.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Here is a prime example of its usefulness.  You log in to play and are in<br/>
&gt;Highpass.  Not much action there so you decide you want to go to either<br/>
&gt;Cazic Thule or Permafrost.  Getting to Cazic requires you to cross six<br/>
&gt;zones.  Getting to Perma requires you to also cross six zones.  If you are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;class that has to run the entire distance, lets assume its gonna take you<br/>
&gt;about 30 minutes to get to either place.  You decide to go to Permafrost<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;when you arrive there isn&#39;t anyone in their for you to group with.  You<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;wasted at least an hour of playing time (30 minutes to get there plus the<br/>
&gt;time to now run to Cazic).  Time spent needlessly running is not fun, no<br/>
&gt;matter which class you play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A /who command that allowed you to see the zone population of zones outside<br/>
&gt;the zone you are presently in would prevent a situation like this occuring.<br/>
&gt;While still in Highpass, you type in /who permafrost.  You could then send<br/>
&gt;/tell messages to someone in the zone near your level to see if you can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>join<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;their group.  If you don&#39;t have luck with Permanfrost, you can then type in<br/>
&gt;/who cazic and try there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t think of any way this would affect any class balance issue.<br/>
&gt;Assuming that class balance is not affected in any manner by adding this<br/>
&gt;/who command, the only reason I can think of to not implement it is that it<br/>
&gt;is too hard to code.<br/>
