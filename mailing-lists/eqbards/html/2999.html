<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-133510215">Well these are the connections that I am using, my cable modem connection<br/>
is unreliable at times.  From what I have noticed the higher the<br/>
packet loss % or the higher the amount of incoming data will affect my<br/>
ability to Twist.  Situations like standing in a room where<br/>
three parties are in combat results in a large amount incoming data.<br/>
<br/>
Well down to the connections<br/>
cable modem - Rogers@Home<br/>
Globalserve - 28.8K Modem<br/>
<br/>
Surprisingly the modem gives me better packet loss percentage, while the<br/>
cable modem gives me better ping time and over all lower bursting data.<br/>
My preferenece would be the modem if it were not for the low speed =(. <br/>
