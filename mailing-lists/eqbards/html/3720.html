<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747455128"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;After fighting my way up to level 11, mostly solo, and barely getting<br/>
&gt;enough plat to afford my songs at each level, I was told that I should<br/>
&gt;work on trade skills to make the money I needed.  Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>
&gt;good then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Granted my husbands ranger character made my bards patchwork for me (the<br/>
fathest I&#39;ve gone as far as twinking on any of my characters) but I never<br/>
had any trouble making enough coin to stay ahead of myself in spells by at<br/>
least two levels, and I soloed almost exclusively until I hit 10th or so.<br/>
Spent a little time here and there with the group that has become my regular<br/>
party, and granted Liani&#39;s betrothed gave her a combine long sword as a<br/>
betrothal present  at 15th level or so, but everything I see on this list<br/>
confuses the heck out of me.<br/>
<br/>
Money has NEVER been a problem for me... though granted I&#39;ve never seen more<br/>
than 50 platinum in any one place and it boggles my mind to see people<br/>
buying things through auction for 1000 plat or more.... what has been a<br/>
problem for ME is levelling.  Partied with my friends I have ALOT of fun but<br/>
I rarely get much of the experience from any given series of kills... which<br/>
only gets worse because they keep getting farther and farther ahead of me...<br/>
and since 12th level I&#39;ve been virtually incapable of soloing much of<br/>
anything that gives me experience without getting my butt killed.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
playing this game since the first week it went public, and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
my bard since the very day that the Bristlebane server opened... and she is<br/>
only 16th level.. about two bubbles from 17th.<br/>
<br/>
So... anyone have any ideas?</div>
