<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424287049">First let me apologize for spaming the list the last few times.<br/>
<br/>
Second let me explain as the Wanderer already did for me, that infact I am<br/>
not spaming the list the web mail client I occasionally use when not at home<br/>
is spaming it.  I do try not to post often because of this.  But sometimes I<br/>
want to say and be a part and I hope that it&#39;ll behave that time.<br/>
<br/>
Third it&#39;s some times more polite to note that if there are mulitple copies<br/>
of the message that more then likely if it is an on topic mail that contains<br/>
the same message and no binary that it&#39;s probably a server problem outside<br/>
of the users control.  However I did have and will continue to deal with my<br/>
ISP about the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth I&#39;m really glad to hear and see so many other stories of bards<br/>
misunderstood :)  Thought it was only me for a bit<br/>
