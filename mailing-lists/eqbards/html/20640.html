<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366701559">With my current guild I am in the Enchanter group on most plane raids now.<br/>
My usually line up is focused on keeping the 2 chanters in my group alive.<br/>
On pulls I weave VoV + Nillipus + Purifying Rhythms w/drum.  This adds a<br/>
nice chunk of AC to the chanters, tends to tuant mobs off them at times, and<br/>
gives them some protection from the nastier effects on the planes.  After<br/>
they have locked down the pull I usually do VoV + Clarity.  As keeping the 2<br/>
chanters full of mana is more important (for the mezzing group) then<br/>
anything else.  The only time I get in and melee is on spite golems, since<br/>
there is usually a huge crowd around the current target.<br/>
<br/>
One additional thing I have been using lately is Song of Twilight.  This has<br/>
a nice effect of pulling the mobs toward you.  Great for when the silly<br/>
melee&#39;ers have pushed the mob up on the wall.<br/>

&gt; i would try to get the tanks to spread out damage among them <br/>
&gt; and use vov, nivs, hymn.<br/>
&gt; on paper the enchanters hastes are better, but in real life, <br/>
&gt; any speed up song/spell with any<br/>
&gt; haste item gets you to max haste.  so he can save his mana <br/>
&gt; for other stuff.    you could<br/>
&gt; also pull multiples and use charm.  we break the king room in <br/>
&gt; lower guk by pulling 2 and 3<br/>
&gt; at a time, just cuz it&#39;s quicker.<br/>
