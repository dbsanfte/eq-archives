components, they need things that spawn in the world.  However, it takes<br/>
them hours to appear, and if one person picks it up, another cleric has<br/>
lots their shot (so to speak).  I feel damn sorry that they have to camp<br/>
Bilge for their breastplate.<br/>

I very much doubt they will make our quest armor any more difficult to<br/>
obtain.  I see it (the armor) as, not only our midlife wardrobe, but also<br/>
our identifier.  If you see someone wearing purple, you know they&#39;re a<br/>
cleric.  Colorful robes are magicians.  Warriors are garbed in pale blue.<br/>
Rogues can be most often found in black.  And what was that deep blue<br/>
streak that just flew past?<br/>
