<div id="ygrps-yiv-262644435">Here&#39;s the exact text - I don&#39;t think most clerics would object:<br/>
<br/>
First I want to ask you all to keep within the generally existing mechanics.<br/>
We&#39;re looking for balance, but I&#39;m not going to bring a dozen new spell<br/>
ideas to the team as a balance tool... And, realistically, we have to keep<br/>
the ideas to things that won&#39;t require a team of artists and programmers to<br/>
create.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve gleaned so far, filtered through my own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Healing:<br/>
<br/>
Druids (and Shaman) want to be better at healing. Not only would this give<br/>
them a more active roll at the end of the big raids, while at the same time<br/>
reducing perceived &#39;need&#39; for clerics at such times. But we also have to<br/>
keep in mind that healing is the clerics role, and we do not want to<br/>
infringe on that role.<br/>
<br/>
So the proposal is this:<br/>
<br/>
Move Superior Healing to 49th level.<br/>
<br/>
Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy - a<br/>
fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing<br/>
that won&#39;t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing<br/>
spells.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe add another healing spell at 60th level - perhaps Divine Light (though<br/>
I&#39;d rename it...)<br/>
<br/>
Reduce the fizzle rate on druid healing spells at the 50+ level.<br/>

<br/>
well shaman, druids, and paladins all got superior heal.  they start giving<br/>
out better heal spells and clerics will cry foul.<br/>
