<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-747945953">In most cases where the group leader and the rest of the party asks to stop<br/>
doing something because it is dumb/dangerous/etc. and the group member<br/>
continues to behave in the dumb/dangerous/etc. way then there are two words<br/>
that are often uttered to that group member...<br/>
<br/>
	Buh Bye!<br/>
<br/>
	It sounded like you were able to take on each dervish with the three<br/>
fighter types alone. Although the wizard is very nice to have in times of<br/>
need, it often doesn&#39;t warrant putting up with something that can get you<br/>
killed.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)Last night while in the West Commonlands my party was camping<br/>
8)the Dervish<br/>
8)Cutthroat site. I live in Hawaii so at that time of the night<br/>
8)there were<br/>
8)less than 20 people in the zone and we were the only group at<br/>
8)the dervish<br/>
8)camp.  We only had four people in the party, a paladin, a<br/>
8)ranger, a wizard,<br/>
8)and myself (all around 13th level).  Because we were the only<br/>
8)party at the<br/>
8)site, when we arrived the entire camp was full of cutthroats,<br/>
8)around 6 or 7<br/>
8)total (fortunately no mages).  Knowing that we couldn&#39;t take<br/>
8)them all on at<br/>
8)once, I told the party to stay back and let me do some bard<br/>
8)magic.  After<br/>
8)equipping my mandolin, I proceeded to Lament (sadden) three<br/>
8)cutthroats and<br/>
8)attacked another one.  I ran back out to where my party was<br/>
8)and we easily<br/>
8)dispatched the cutthroats that followed.  Once we were ready,<br/>
8)we dispatched<br/>
8)the ones that I had initially Lamented.  After that, we were<br/>
8)able to take on<br/>
8)the cutthroats one by one as they respawned.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)After the initials battles, my party thanked me for using the<br/>
8)Lament tactic.<br/>
8)They all stated they had grouped with bards before and had<br/>
8)never seen the<br/>
8)song used in the manner I had used it.  I thought that was<br/>
8)odd because I<br/>
8)heard about the trick from this forum so assumed a lot of<br/>
8)other people used<br/>
8)it frequently.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)So what&#39;s the point of this post?  Well, the bard community<br/>
8)needs to educate<br/>
8)the other classes on everything that we can do for a party.<br/>
8)A lot of other<br/>
8)players seem to think that our main purpose in a group is to<br/>
8)play Selo,<br/>
8)Hymn, Anthem, and at higher levels, Mana regen.  I&#39;m only<br/>
8)13th level but<br/>
8)I&#39;ve learned there is a lot more to it than that.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)If anyone else knows of similar tactics that only a bard can<br/>
8)perform I would<br/>
8)like to hear about them also.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Now for the rant<br/>
8)<br/>
8)After we cleared out the initial cutthroats, we were pretty<br/>
8)much able to<br/>
8)take them on one by one from that point on until we ran into<br/>
8)a stumbling<br/>
8)block.  Here is what happened.  The paladin, the ranger and<br/>
8)myself, aided by<br/>
8)the Anthem could easily handle one cutthroat at a time.<br/>
8)However, our wizard<br/>
8)insisted on expending his mana with direct damage spells even<br/>
8)though the<br/>
8)tanks were whittling down the cutthroat without taking that<br/>
8)much damage.<br/>
8)The damage we were taking could quickly be healed via the<br/>
8)Hymn after the<br/>
8)combat was over.  What eventually happened was that the fully<br/>
8)healed tanks<br/>
8)ended up standing around while the wizard meditated.  In the<br/>
8)meantime, the<br/>
8)camp fully respawned.  This time, however, there were 3 mages<br/>
8)plus a couple<br/>
8)of thugs.  I tried the Lament trick again but a mage resisted<br/>
8)and everyone<br/>
8)got waxed except the wizard, who gated.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)I don&#39;t like telling other people how to play their character<br/>
8)but how do you<br/>
8)handle a magic user who insists on wasting his mana?  The<br/>
8)group leader kept<br/>
8)telling him to save mana but it didn&#39;t do any good.  I can<br/>
8)see using one<br/>
8)direct damage spell to help the combat but he would continue<br/>
8)spellcasting<br/>
8)once the cutthroat started to flee.  At this point, no one<br/>
8)was in any danger<br/>
8)because the cutthroat was fighting back.  He created a lot of needless<br/>
8)downtime by his actions.  Any other recommendation other than<br/>
8)finding a<br/>
8)different group to adventure with?<br/>
