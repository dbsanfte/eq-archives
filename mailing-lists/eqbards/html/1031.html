&gt;I think one of the main problems at the moment with our songs is<br/>
&gt;the fact that &#39;resistances&#39; are broken. (Or so I&#39;ve been lead to<br/>
&gt;believe).<br/>
&gt;So, what good is Elemental Rhythms and Purifying Rhythms if they<br/>
&gt;do nothing to help you combat spellcasters or undeads or the like?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I mentioned in an earlier post, my level 13 bard plays 3 songs<br/>
&gt;out of the 13 available: Anthem, Bellow and Heal.<br/>
&gt;The occasionally Accelerando or Locating Lyric not withstanding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe the higher level songs will add some variety, but from what<br/>
&gt;I have seen of spell listings, the most useful ones seem to just<br/>
&gt;be upgrades of lower level songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hence my bard is also on vacation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, no, man!!  Get your bard out there and play!!  So what if you use the<br/>
same songs?  The fun is in being with friends and helping them (and<br/>
yourself!).<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was in a group that was doing the tower in Tae room at Thule.<br/>
I used 3 songs all night.  The mana song, chains, and anthem.  Ok, a couple<br/>
times I played with Pixie Strike now that it&#39;s fixed, but that was just for<br/>
the heck of it. =)  When I had to log for the night, I found another mana<br/>
bard to replace me (I tried to get a paladin friend of mine in group to<br/>
replace me, but the group REFUSED to take a tank... they didn&#39;t want a<br/>
cleric who came just as I was announcing I was going to have to leave soon<br/>
either... they HAD to have a mana bard!  I think I spoiled them. =) ).  The<br/>
other bard was concerned because she didn&#39;t want to have to sleep that level<br/>
of monster and was overjoyed when I told her she only needed to play 3 songs<br/>
and which songs they were.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you can join a *GOOD* guild, do it!!  I joined Black Moon guild on<br/>
Mithaniel Marr just before logging Thursday night.  Last night, I thought I<br/>
was in heaven!  Three invites to join groups within first 15 minutes of<br/>
logging in!  This is my 3d guild I&#39;ve been in, and the first time I actually<br/>
felt wanted and appreciated!  By comparison, in my previous guild, I had 1<br/>
invite to join a group in a week, and their guildchat was filled with<br/>
gloating over dumping trains on people.<br/>
<br/>
Find yourself a good guild and join it!!  If it turns out bad, just dump<br/>
them and find another.  Because when you find that really good guild, like<br/>
I&#39;ve found BM, your enjoyment of the game will increase tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
My thanks to Shada for inviting me into this wonderful guild!<br/>
<br/>
A very happy<br/>
