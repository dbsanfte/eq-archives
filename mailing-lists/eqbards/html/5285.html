In my travels across Antonica, I offered to run some folks down from<br/>
HighPass Hold.  Well one of the party casts Levitate and we set merrily off<br/>
down the ramp.  As I run down the middle of the canyon, my levi starts to<br/>
slowly drop off until I flutter gently to the ground.  As I run down the<br/>
canyon, who do I meet but the so far totally elusive Milea Clothspinner!<br/>
Make a mental note as I pass her - to check with her sister next time I am<br/>
in Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
And lo - Nerissa is still concerned about Milea so I agree to take the note<br/>
out to her. <br/>
<br/>
Well, here I am at he base of HH ramp and some time on my hands.  And there<br/>
is Sellkie (high 20&#39;s Paladin) of the Light Brigade so I axe him if he wants<br/>
to join me on this quest. And we trot off up the lower canyon to find Milea.<br/>
Since Sellkie is not worried about spoilers, I splain to him how this guard<br/>
is gonna show up after I give Milea a note and how we or me gotta schwack<br/>
this guard but I got no clue about how he cons or what faction hits are<br/>
gonna happen if he gets killed. <br/>
<br/>
So, we decide to disband the group and I will con the guard and if it looks<br/>
do-able, I will attack him and take what ever factions I get.  Sure nuff,<br/>
after a brief exchange with Milea, this guard comes marching up and attacks<br/>
her.  I had conned Milea and she was red to me - now I con the guard and he<br/>
is blue or lower to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Avast! you bastage - how dare you strike a woman!!!  Take this you bastage!<br/>
Feel the point of my Ashenwood Short Stabber!  Take that -- you bastage!!! <br/>
<br/>
The fight is about even and I am down to half my health and starting to get<br/>
a bit worried.  I know Sellkie is standing by but I am thinking I gotta<br/>
finish this on my own.  This is where I got real stoopid.  I figger Milea<br/>
here can tank for me some and I try to scrape the guard off on her.  <br/>
<br/>
But no, somehow I manage to attack Milea too!!!  YIKES!!!  What did I do??<br/>
Either hit a key for an AE song or mouse look targeted her by accident with<br/>
auto-attack on.  At any rate, I am under half HP and now have a red con<br/>
warrior in full steel plate attacking me.  So, I yell to Sellkie that the<br/>
plan has kinda come unglued and I am gonna zone these two.  Well, he gives<br/>
me a heal or a LOH and I bolt down the canyon.  <br/>
<br/>
Melia chases me and I am running for the Wooden Bridge.  Meanwhile, the<br/>
guard got pissed at Sellkie and made the mistake of attacking him.  The<br/>
guard falls easily to Sellkie&#39;s blade.  Sellkie is shouting &quot;CLOTHSPINNER TO<br/>
THE ZONE!!!&quot;  &quot;Look out for a Sylly train to the zone&quot;  I am laughing so<br/>
hard I can barely run.  Milea realizes that there is no way she can catch me<br/>
and decides to head back to her guard post.  <br/>
<br/>
On the way back she spots Sellkie and remembers that he was the one who<br/>
helped her attacker (me) and she frenzies on him.  Another mistake for her.<br/>
Sellkie dispatches her just as I get back to him.  Wow - I bet that really<br/>
impressed him with my superior cunning and fight skills.  Dragged him into<br/>
two fights with faction hits he wasn&#39;t planning on - wonder if they will<br/>
cancel each other or just got worse on both sides???  I got them too but<br/>
didn&#39;t look closely at them.  Another Sylly Quest gone horribly awry!<br/>
