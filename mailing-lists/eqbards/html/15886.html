<div id="ygrps-yiv-459402209">Mithril torque is AC7, 13int/wis.  Hehe, wearing it purely for the AC, have<br/>
had no luck whatsoever trying to get a runed lava pendent.  Even broke down<br/>
and tried to camp it myself yesterday. Problem was I didn&#39;t know where the<br/>
lava elemental spawned, so I was wandering around semi-aimlessly when the<br/>
lava elemental found me.  I was at half health at the time, and he gave me a<br/>
pretty sound thrashing.  Tough little bugger for a greenie.  Eventually I<br/>
had to resort to fearing him off while I healed myself up (I was down to 78<br/>
hit points).  At full health I was able to take him.  Dropped a crappy<br/>
potion.<br/>
I&#39;ll probably swap out my shoulders for the crested as soon as I dig up a<br/>
pair.  (yeah, I know, they&#39;re easy to get)<br/>
I&#39;m going a little AC nuts lately, but it really seems to make a difference,<br/>
so I&#39;m trying to squeeze as many points as I can.  One of the rangers in my<br/>
guild is even more extreme, he&#39;s started wearing 10AC, -7MR rings, just to<br/>
get his AC as high as possible :)<br/>

crested is highest AC i know of for bards, that&#39;s what i wear (i know i lose<br/>
DEX, but i wanted to break 800 hehe) and i can&#39;t get a cloak upgrade with<br/>
only 500pp in the bank.  you can wear a hero bracer, i can&#39;t.  you also have<br/>
the advantage of wearing an imbrued helm full-time (i have to wear a froglok<br/>
crown, i have gotten *cough* screwed *cough* out of a couple tranix crowns,<br/>
but i am gonna be borrowing one soon).  i can only wear mine to give people<br/>
a laugh.  and i get 0 AC from my haste sash.  i have to save up a lot more<br/>
points and get lucky to grab an RBB.  very nice stuff Elwyn.  we have very<br/>
very similar equipment (the RBB being the biggest difference).  what&#39;s the<br/>
stats on the mithril torque?  i grabbed myself a runed lava pendant recently<br/>
for the neck slot.  i know the torques are easy as hell to get as most<br/>
people don&#39;t care one way or the other if they get one, unless that has<br/>
changed recently cause of its AC.<br/>

&gt; 815AC now, check it out if you&#39;re interested.  Can prolly <br/>
&gt; squeeze another 10<br/>
&gt; points with a cloak and shoulder upgrade.<br/>
&gt; Some of the stats might be off by a couple points, I haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; updated them<br/>
&gt; since I changed around some equipment.  <br/>
