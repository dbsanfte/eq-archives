&gt; 	Un-nerf Cazic? I got from Brad and John that they were <br/>
&gt; gonna un-nerf the<br/>
&gt; entire zone. John&#39;s quote after us telling him that we were <br/>
&gt; planning on<br/>
&gt; going to Fear next week, &quot;Let&#39;s drink to your characters now <br/>
&gt; while they are<br/>
&gt; still alive.&quot; Brad&#39;s comment about making the zone-in point <br/>
&gt; relatively safe<br/>
&gt; was that it was a moment of weakness on his part. He sorta <br/>
&gt; had this odd<br/>
&gt; smile on his face then... =/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Good Journey,<br/>
