Double Entendre<br/>
Bard of 21 SOngs<br/>
Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This idea was brought up on this mailing list quite<br/>
some time ago, and<br/>
never <br/>
reached fruition. I therefore would like to entreat<br/>
the EQ bardic<br/>
community <br/>
to join ranks and set out to do something truly silly<br/>
and pointless <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I am sure you are thinking, &quot;What can<br/>
we do together,<br/>
Aloro, <br/>
that would be silly and pointless and FUN?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You ARE thinking that, aren&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
Good! So here is my proposal:<br/>
<br/>
What: Gnomestock &#39;99<br/>
When: Friday, November 26th, starting at noon PST (or<br/>
another time if<br/>
the <br/>
community prefers...)<br/>
Who: Anyone who plays a bard on EQ, or any of their<br/>
friends, family, or<br/>
<br/>
pets.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;</div>
