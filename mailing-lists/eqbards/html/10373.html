<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393728419">I also would like the the dmg equation for CoD and DDD... As far as<br/>
griffawns go I was Kiteing them at 17 useing CoD, Bellows, Selos.  But they<br/>
are pretty slow so you should have no problem. thing about them tho..when i<br/>
kited kodiaks and such i would run around trees and such so it was harder<br/>
for them to get to me. Griffawns was diffrent since they fly. they didnt<br/>
seem impeaded with my attempt to get them to slow down by running them<br/>
through trees. Hope this information helps you.<br/>

&gt; No one knows the dmg equation for CoD?  Thats actually one of the more<br/>
&gt; important ones =)  I&#39;ve been kiting yellow gorge hounds at level 15 (just<br/>
&gt; got 16) and wasn&#39;t able to tell if weaving selos/bellow/cod was better<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than<br/>

&gt; know if I would be able to kite griffawns like this?   I hear they run the<br/>
&gt; same speed as hounds, and I never actually get hit while kiting...I just<br/>
&gt; sorta run around in a circle to the beat of my own footsteps =)<br/>
