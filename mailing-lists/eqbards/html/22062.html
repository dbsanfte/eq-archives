<div id="ygrps-yiv-275247826">Well that&#39;s not entirely fair. He states that his own test is inconclusive:<br/>
So, what have I to conclude from my testing?<br/>
Not a thing.<br/>
<br/>
His quote about being a happy bard is simply stating that he enjoyed a <br/>
bard&#39;s versatility and usefulness. He never really bring&#39;s up John Kim&#39;s <br/>
statistics that I see. He does talk about some &quot;debate about Bards and <br/>
their Lullaby&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just based on this one article, he doesn&#39;t really sound like a very serious <br/>
bard.<br/>

&gt;completely throw out the detailed study John Kim had posted (article<br/>
&gt;comments indicate that was the thread he had been reading) and instead<br/>
&gt;rely on his very brief experience with the song before he got distracted<br/>
&gt;helping a player find his corpse. Then he announces he&#39;s perfectly happy<br/>
&gt;with the song, as if that negates anyone else&#39;s concerns. This seems<br/>
&gt;little different than Abashi&#39;s attitude.<br/>

&gt; &gt; doh, i was hoping he was at least a few levels higher *sigh*<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hmm. Check out his other article here. A little less encouraging, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; say.<br/>
