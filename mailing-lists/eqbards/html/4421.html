I had the almost exact same thing happen to me the other day on Bristlebane.<br/>
Listen to this and I swear you will pee all over yourself.<br/>
Last weekend my cleric friend and I were in EK doing the lion/crawler/hound<br/>
shuffle when towards the end of the fight with one of these critters my<br/>
cleric friend healed himself and we hear someone shout CHEATER!<br/>
<br/>
Normally, I just ignore shouts as spam and go about business as usual.<br/>
however, looking around I noticed the source of the shout was staring<br/>
directly at my cleric friend and said *Cheater* again. We&#39;re all, WTF? This<br/>
guy con&#39;d  Red as Lenin to me so, at first I was taken aback and wondered<br/>
just what he was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Yes? we ask him. Just how and what are we doing to cheat?<br/>
I was dumbfounded.<br/>
The guy says, You cast heal on yourself!<br/>
&lt;blinks&gt;<br/>
WTF you talking about, man?<br/>
The guy says, That is IMPOSSIBLE! I am a level 30 cleric and can&#39;t cast<br/>
spells in combat! You CHEATED. I get interrupted all the time so it is<br/>
IMPOSSIBLE.<br/>
&lt;blinks again&gt;<br/>
Channeling, we say.<br/>
CHANNELING? What is Channeling? he asks.<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, suffice it to say Mr. Level 30 Cleric had never<br/>
heard of Channeling and had about a gazzillion practice points saved up for<br/>
that *Special Training* he apparently dreamed of spending them on.  He has<br/>
never spent a practice point in his life.<br/>
JESUS H CHRIST! Can you imagine his down time for meditating?<br/>
Yes, we did school him on training points and channeling/interruptions.  But<br/>
being the * fu**ing bitch *  (his own words) that I am, made a complete fool<br/>
out of him in the process.  I usually dont do that sort of thing because I<br/>
hate to be at the recieving end of someones ridicule as much as the next<br/>
guy, but CRIMINY! Level 30! And to boot he was being a total ass to us, and<br/>
called us Cheaters. If he would have been nice and asked how we were doing<br/>
such a WONDOROUS THING as being able to cast spells in combat, I would have<br/>
not made him feel so small.<br/>

&gt;Carrying all that stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;A bard who doesn&#39;t like carrying instruments???&quot;  And he just said, &quot;Yup.&quot;<br/>
&gt;But a mandolin weighs absolutely nothing!  But the songs are much more<br/>
&gt;effective when played, singing them is like like like....  I couldn&#39;t say </span></blockquote></div>
