<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696620989">Well I am going to buck the trend here are say Bards should NOT be in<br/>
lotto&#39;s for CoF or RBB&#39;s.  Yes they are nice items, yes I would love to have<br/>
one (esp the Cloak). But would I take one if there was a real melee class<br/>
there that need one?  No.  Why? We do just as well with a Swirlspine or a<br/>
FBSS.  Since with one of these we can hit max haste with ease.  The funny<br/>
thing is the other day I was chatting with on of the other 50 bards in my<br/>
guild (there are 4 of us).  And we both felt we were being LESS effective<br/>
using weapons in nearly any situation (even soloing) then in using<br/>
instrument and songs.  I few weeks ago I won a FBSS and quickly gave to a<br/>
42nd lvl monk friend, since I knew he would but it to much better use then I<br/>
ever will.  I even pass my swirlspine off to another character that gets<br/>
much more use out of it then me.  I am happy to wait for a Belt of<br/>
Concordance to come way personally.  If you need a haste item then get into<br/>
a pickup group at the Frenzied, even if the group is using a list you will<br/>
get in quick.  As the pulls there are very fast and you need to keep<br/>
downtime to a minimum.<br/>

PS My guild has always had a policy that Bards do not roll on CoF/RBB, even<br/>
then I joke with the raid leader about it everytime ;)<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] ugh, shutting bards out of lotto getting more<br/>
&gt; widespread <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; tonight i found out that no longer will bards in our guild be <br/>
&gt; allowed on<br/>
&gt; lotto for haste items, ever. (unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 cloak of flames dropped off nagafen last time (i wasn&#39;t there or i<br/>
&gt; would&#39;ve known about this sooner) and bards were excluded in <br/>
&gt; the lotto.  no<br/>
&gt; more runed bolster belts will be going to bards either.  <br/>
&gt; (fbss only likely<br/>
&gt; one now, and only then if no other guild members that need it <br/>
&gt; are in group<br/>
&gt; according to guild rules)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a <br/>
&gt; guild of 150+<br/>
&gt; different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the <br/>
&gt; leaders of the guild<br/>
&gt; are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; need a haste<br/>
&gt; item. (even tho they stack)  being a huge guild, the leaders <br/>
&gt; get whines and<br/>
&gt; rants all the time, so our chances of convincing them <br/>
&gt; otherwise is very<br/>
&gt; slim.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; any ideas?<br/>
