<div id="ygrps-yiv-295197656">ROFLMAO!!!   Yhere&#39;s just something about that Ill Omen zone that makes folks toss out that &quot;KSr&quot; term...<br/>
<br/>
A few months back, I was solo&#39;ing the Sarnak guard tower in Ill Omen (nailing one when it spawned, then bringing it outside to fight).  During a lull in the spawns, I found myself at the base of the tower hoping something blue (/con) would pass my way.<br/>
<br/>
Lo and behold a nice blue Sarnak happened to walk almost right to me.  Being the brave bardic type I am, I laid into it with blades a-whirling and songs a-singing.  About at the end of the figh I see this paladin watching me; &quot;an admirer, how nice&quot; I thought.  Wrong.  It was some lunkhead who got angry with me for stealing his spawn.  I thought it was pretty funny considering the Sarnak was *walking* towards the tower, and looked to have no damage.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess my laughter got under his skin, so he threatened to /petition me.  That, of course, brought me demmed near to falling out of my chair with laughter, but it was the last part that I found the funniest:  &quot;Afer all, you are an infamous KSr&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I still laugh when I think about that.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I too play on The Rathe, so you might find this amusing B (seems to be a<br/>
&gt;lot of ignorance on Rathe).  Instead of boring you with a long story I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;make it short.  I had a day in Ill Omen a month back when I was charming.<br/>
&gt;All alone in part of the zone, I had not seen another player in about an<br/>
&gt;hour.  I was charming mobs for one on one fights.  This warrior and bard(of<br/>
&gt;all people!) come along and start trying to kill steal.  Now they have me<br/>
&gt;distracted and two wandering mobs jump me.  No problem, I&#39;ll just run in<br/>
&gt;circles while charming.  They start disrupting the mobs that are following<br/>
&gt;me by hitting the one my pet is on, by now I lose about 400 hp because of<br/>
&gt;it.  While they are killing one of the mobs, some fool caster trains me<br/>
&gt;with 6 mobs.  I give a real life sigh and just figure if the warrior and<br/>
&gt;bard go away I&#39;ll just have a 30 minutes challenge on my hands (sounds like<br/>
&gt;fun!).  Nope . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is the good part.  Half way through killing these I get a tell.<br/>
&gt;Warrior: &quot;If you do that again I&#39;ll have your account banned.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Me: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br/>
&gt;Warrior: &quot;You were charm kiting.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Me: &quot;Yea, since when is that against the rules?&quot;<br/>
&gt;Me: &quot;Aren&#39;t you the one who just tried to kill steal?  You know that IS<br/>
&gt;against the rules, and I could petition you for it, but I am not.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Warrior: &quot;You had about 10 mobs on you.  You are hogging all the kills.<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re not even getting hit.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Me: &quot;Yea, because I was trained.  I usually only have a one on one fight<br/>
&gt;until people jump in where they don&#39;t belong.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Me: &quot;So you are going to petition me because you&#39;re jealous?&quot;<br/>
&gt;Warrior: &quot;It&#39;s not fair, your not getting hit, so that is exploiting.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Me: &quot;Go ahead and petition then.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was on for probably another 4 or 5 hours that night and I never got a<br/>
&gt;tell from a GM, I assumed they just laughed, if he petitioned at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ignorance at it&#39;s finest.<br/>
