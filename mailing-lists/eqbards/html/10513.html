<b>Subject:</b> Maid and Butler camping? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-196560007">I think the time has come that I pick up an ebw.  I&#39;ve got a ykesha for my<br/>
primary, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m willing to do that camp again for a while.<br/>
The ebw seems like a good choice for a secondary weapon anyway since its<br/>
faster than the ykesha, and off hand proc&#39;s never seem to happen much for<br/>
me.<br/>
Anyway, not having a whole lot of experience with MM, I know how to get to<br/>
the maid and butler rooms, but I&#39;m not really very familiar with spawns and<br/>
aggro radius&#39; in there, I was just wondering if anyone can offer any advice.<br/>
Where is the best/safest place to camp?  Can I do it solo, or should I bring<br/>
along anyone else?  About how long does it take on average to get both<br/>
fangs?<br/>
Any advice would be helpful.<br/>
