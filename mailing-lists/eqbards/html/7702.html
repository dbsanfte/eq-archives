&gt; &gt;At lower levels (where you&#39;ll never get a mana stone unless you are a<br/>
&gt; &gt;twink) After 32 it&#39;s a rare party that wants the heal song, even woven<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the mana song. (partly because thanks to Verant not bothering with<br/>
&gt; &gt;an icon, no one believes that the mana song lasts 3 ticks)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In cases where Hymn is needed I will weave it regards of the finger-wiggler <br/>
&gt; whining :)  I have been pulsing Hymn then two pulses of Clarity then Hymn <br/>
&gt; again.  It keeps everyone happy and the cleric does not have to top everyone <br/>
&gt; off.<br/>

druid who casts regen before everyone sits. Personally I&#39;m happy for a<br/>
break from the tendonitis inducing song weaving, which I do quite enough<br/>
of in combat. I&#39;d rather keep my fingers free for the resting chatter<br/>
and strategy discussion.<br/>
