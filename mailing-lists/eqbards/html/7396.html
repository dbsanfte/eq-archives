&gt; We are not getting bind.  We will never get bind and we have less need for<br/>
&gt; bind than any other class, considering the rate at which we run.<br/>
&gt; Talies, please KABONG this before this whole arguement starts up yet<br/>

amendment right to free speech just because you have heard other lame<br/>
excuses for why we should get bind.  <br/>
<br/>
It was an idea that could blossom into possibily stimulating trade, hell<br/>
make the reagent needed to sing it specific to each of the new foraged foods<br/>
that have put in per zone, take it a step further and make that agent need<br/>
to be baked into a high level item, or brewed into a high level item to be<br/>
usable.<br/>
<br/>
Its an interesting idea. And dont make assumptions for everyone else on the<br/>
list, they mayt not be sick of it.</div>
