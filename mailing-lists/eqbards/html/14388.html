<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156511092">Not to be a party pooper again Golias, but that&#39;s cause they had to break up<br/>
the 40 zones because they found out early on that they couldn&#39;t handle the<br/>
load with the larger zones.  That&#39;s why some zones have such ridiculous name<br/>
codes now.  They used to be all one zone and breaking them up they just<br/>
slapped on whatever came to mind.<br/>

Golias, the official LoreKeeper of Trivial Items, would like to mention...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the gripe about Verant releasing only 3 continents out of 5, and<br/>
how<br/>
that somehow relates to them being lazy/not delivering on their promises.<br/>
<br/>
For those that didn&#39;t slavishly follow the game before beta and release, nor<br/>
read the chat logs with Brad and group, here&#39;s the scoop.<br/>
<br/>
The original spec said 5 continents with 40 zones.  They shipped with 3<br/>
continents and over 70 zones.<br/>
<br/>
Just, FYI.<br/>
