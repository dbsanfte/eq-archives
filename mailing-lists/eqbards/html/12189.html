(hehe yup waaaay to much time in Sol-B)<br/>
<br/>
GIBS are definitely &#39;different&#39; - per their special ability to see<br/>
invis-vs-undead - could easily be different in other ways as well - ie<br/>
higher MR <br/>
<br/>
One thing about the bedroom is unpredictability.  You can be fighting in the<br/>
room just fine and - whammo a train arrives.  You can blow a spawn time (or<br/>
simply not keep time) pull the GIBS and now 5 bad skellies and a couple<br/>
froggies - ugh. <br/>
<br/>
(switching zones here to Sol-B)<br/>
<br/>
Sonic bats are bad yes but in your upper 30&#39;s/low 40&#39;s you will meet them<br/>
when you go to Sol-B.  We had 3 40&#39;s bard cleric ranger, a 42 druid, a 44<br/>
pal and a 36 war.  We camped the Nobel room.  Our 36 war (lev 50&#39;s twink)<br/>
decides to pull from the bat room.  Ok doing good for a couple pulls -<br/>
sonics are blue to me at 40.  Then the pull from Hell.  3 sonics and a fire<br/>
beetle (? - not lava duct crawler but the weaker bug)!!  So, I go into mez<br/>
(pixie striking) mode and elemental for MR and we fight them. One by one we<br/>
take em down.  Just as we get the last one - the room spawns and after the<br/>
first greater kobold we get a soluesk kobold.  Turns out to be a non-stop 6<br/>
kill fight.  Ugh - everyone is OOM, Pal used LoH (lay on hands) on someone,<br/>
we are all less than half hp in the end. Yeesh.  Damn glad I carry jasper<br/>
and bloodstones now!  Gave a stack to the cleric and asked him to buff _all_<br/>
of us. (Yes, Harm - the cleric was Bate, the Pal was Adluh and the 36 war<br/>
was - yup yup you guessed it Sense (Sensorama&#39;s twink) ;p)<br/>
<br/>
You are level 40??? Hehe - woo hoo you made my day!!   Sylly is level 40 too<br/>
and hehe caught ya!  (Well ok you are still ahead but that&#39;s pretty scary<br/>
no?)  Hell - yes - xp is slow unless you get a good group and go to good<br/>
spots.  Greater Kobs in full party&#39;s are not good xp.  GK&#39;s with a higher<br/>
level partner (me and a 46 druid and some times just 1 other tank type) do a<br/>
lot better.  And I was in the second bat room with a full group and all but<br/>
one 36 pal were co or higher all the way to 47&#39;s - and we fought there and I<br/>
got one-half bub in 2 to 3 hours.  Lots better than the Nobel camp and<br/>
seemed safer - although they kept talking about something called &quot;the nox&quot; -<br/>
but these were some very good players - not a &#39;pick-up&#39; group by any means.<br/>

&gt; [ Pulling GIBs ]<br/>
&gt; We did this 3 times.  The 3rd time I went to lament the first one and<br/>
lament<br/>
&gt; was resisted, he agro&#39;d and the whole room pulled.  That was not good.  I<br/>
<br/>
Last week, lamenting the GIBs yielded the first critical<br/>
failure (mob resists and goes aggro) I&#39;ve had with Lament<br/>
since I started re-using it at about L35.  Maybe they are more<br/>
resistant to lulls than other mobs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, for a L35-46 party, they are not much trouble.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Could you have taken them?  I would have to say no - maybe you could<br/>
handle<br/>
&gt; room - it&#39;s a disaster - even for a mid to upper 30&#39;s group.  <br/>
<br/>
Hrmph.  We&#39;ve done all 5 at once with a L35-40 group, no<br/>
enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
 (well, the one time it was instant death<br/>
was when we were recuperating from another fight and I didn&#39;t<br/>
have time to get our resists up).<br/>
<br/>
bats, not sonic - sonic bats are in Sol B and are very bad<br/>
news). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; p.s. Yes! I dinged 40 in that camp!  Woo hoo!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent 2 months in 40, and have finally entered that last<br/>
bubble.  Welcome to Hell.  :-)<br/>
