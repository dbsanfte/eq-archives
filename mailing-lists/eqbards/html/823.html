<b>Subject:</b> Grouping and XP bonus <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-14972301">I learned this weekend that there is a 25% XP bonus for groups of 6. I<br/>
didn&#39;t believe it until my group added a 6th person, and our xp rate<br/>
increased dramatically. The 6th person we added was AFK and just sat on a<br/>
rock the whole time. We were doing crocs and caimans in Oasis so the type of<br/>
creature didn&#39;t change. My buddy (also in the groupt) Petitioned a GM to get<br/>
the skinny on this. The GM wouldn&#39;t give out a figure, but did acknowledge<br/>
there is a bonus for total XP distributed in a party of 6.<br/>
<br/>
This gives high level people incentive to get a group of 5 lower ranked<br/>
party members. That person will rake in the XP so long as they&#39;re killing<br/>
things that aren&#39;t too low for his/her level.<br/>

This is from my viewpoint - a former beta-tester who hasn&#39;t jumped into <br/>
commercial yet, so correct any misinformation and I thank you in advance  =)<br/>
<br/>
You are 33 and people 3-5 levels above you won&#39;t group with you?!<br/>
WTF? They must not know that they will get xp (and plenty of it) with you <br/>
around. OK, I don&#39;t remember exactly the floor and ceiling limit for similar<br/>
<br/>
level ppl to group. I know up to like 20th it&#39;s a 4 lvl above or below <br/>
limit. But after 20th things change. When I was 20th I was able to group <br/>
with a 26th level person and get xp. When I was 23 I was grouping with 30th <br/>
level ppl and getting xp. 3-5 level differences at your level will not put <br/>
any significant dent in anyone&#39;s xp gains. They are just being either <br/>
ignorant, or greedy. My 32nd lvl friend used to party with 40th lvl ppl all <br/>
the time.<br/>
