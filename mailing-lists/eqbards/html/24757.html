<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676589296">I did ok at level 40 with over 200 cr and mr.  Didn&#39;t get feared a single time, resisted most of the damage breaths.  Only problem with going at low levels is, no matter what your cr and mr are, vox will recognize that you&#39;re very low level and will go after you hard sometimes.  I got clawed about 5 times by her one time I was there...had a good cleric so I didn&#39;t die tho, think only one person in group did.<br/>
<br/>
Err...so, the point is, if a raid needs bards, you can get in at level 40, but you better have over 200 resists if you don&#39;t wanna die in the first 5 seconds.<br/>

  Yeah I think that sounds about right. I was 46th on my first and only vox<br/>
  raid sofar. It was a disaster btw..<br/>
  I have my own theory why the raid failed.<br/>
  1. There was no minimum MR/CR demand<br/>
  Thats it..<br/>
  I myself was one of the people who did not realise just how important those<br/>
  resists is. I was not clawed once. All damage I took was from breath and my<br/>
  health dropped by 1/4 each time I dident resist! 4 unresisted breaths and I<br/>
  was dead.<br/>
  Mind you I played resist songs with my drum and had my buffed MR/CR well<br/>
  above 100, but that was not enough.<br/>
  Next raid I will only go if I can take my MR/CR (or HR if nafgen) to 100<br/>
  unbuffed. <br/>
<br/>
  Musiker, bard o 47th songs, bertox (I better stop fooling around and get<br/>
  leveling again, Windleaf is ahead of me :P *grin*)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi all,<br/>
  I hit 42nd lvl last week and am looking for a serious raiding guild on<br/>
  Rodcet Nife.  I recently posted to one guild&#39;s website and got an answer<br/>
  back that bards must be 45th lvl in order to be effective on a Vox raid.<br/>
  Is this correct?  Please let me know<br/>
