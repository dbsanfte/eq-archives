<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792185824">I totally agree with Atonal that the &quot;twinked&quot; enchanter shouldn&#39;t get the <br/>
robe, or even get to roll for the robe. Two people playing 4 characters is <br/>
a little ridiculous to me, especially on any serious raid. For one of those <br/>
people to be the guild leader makes me shudder.<br/>
<br/>
I would have made the same decision had I been in your shoes Brilinnia. I <br/>
hope your guildleader hopefully has learned a lesson from this incident and <br/>
that your guild can continue to travel the breadth of Norrath in camaraderie.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m a bit surprised that the leader of a guild that attracts people such as<br/>

&gt;your guild leader, but I do know you, and I supposed I&#39;ve always assumed<br/>

&gt;caused strife internally, as threats to walk should not be taken lightly.  A<br/>
&gt;momentary lapse of reason, perhaps?<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Loot Rights Question<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hail bards and bardettes,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  We had a loot rights discussion this weekend. We had 2 groups together in<br/>
&gt;Howling Stones North Tower. One group had a L44 chanter, a 50s shaman, a 50s<br/>
&gt;warrior, 50s cleric all played by 2 people plus a 50s wiz. The chanter<br/>
&gt;really didn&#39;t function as a chanter and we&#39;d asked them not to bring her<br/>
&gt;along as we had a real working chanter in our group. We got to the last<br/>
&gt;corner before the Crypt keeper&#39;s room and when the monk pulled it, the whole<br/>
&gt;room came. We killed the Crypt Keeper but had alot of mobs on us. Our<br/>
&gt;chanter was doing his best to pause/mez what he could. Then the hallway<br/>
&gt;started to respawn and we had 8 -10 mobs. Our chanter died, I was doing what<br/>
&gt;I could but out numbered by live awake mobs. We called for gates and the<br/>
&gt;other groups wiz got them out. We all died. The necro in our group looted<br/>
&gt;the chanter robe (Siren&#39;s?) off the keeper before he died and I got the key<br/>
&gt;before I died rather than have it poof. The aftermath was they wanted to<br/>
&gt;lotto the robe between the chanter twink and the chanter who died doing CC.<br/>
&gt;We felt this would be very wrong yet they didn&#39;t see it. We felt the twink,<br/>
&gt;while there when the robe dropped, was not being played, else we probably<br/>
&gt;would not have been wiped out. We also all know that char is a twink, not a<br/>
&gt;primary. I think that robe on a twink would hurt our guild&#39;s credibility<br/>
&gt;somewhat as the twink belongs to the head of the guild. It&#39;s also our<br/>
&gt;opinion you can&#39;t function as a good chanter unless the person is giving the<br/>
&gt;character their whole attention. I&#39;d like to hear the opinion of others on<br/>
&gt;this. Were we out of line?<br/>
&gt;The result was I said we&#39;d walk on the guild if they insisted on lottoing<br/>
&gt;it. They agreed to give the robe to the other chanter.<br/>
