  I take it that you are level 27.  If this is the case, forget about<br/>
meleeing Choon and Froon -- pull them both and use your charm song to pit<br/>
them against each other.  After one falls, recharm the winner, run a little<br/>
ways with pet following you, recharm, make him sit down, and run back and<br/>
speed loot the loser.  If you have a caster with you, have them finish off<br/>
the second one as he&#39;s chasing you around.<br/>
