<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492218861">On a similar note this is what happened to me last night, bear in mind<br/>
that my bard is a follower of Erollisi Marr and I have extermely good<br/>
faction with all wood elves due to the fact that I am a wood elf and I<br/>
have slayed too many Crushbone orcs to count (from level 3-20).<br/>
<br/>
I was on the Sister Isle helping a few friends get a bracer of erollisi.<br/>
When as usual a pirate spawneed and  attacked one of the sisters.  Seeing<br/>
this my group mate attacked the pirate and was doing perfectly fine<br/>
against the pirate.  So I joined in since I was doing nothing wihle<br/>
waiting for the boat.  Here was a follower of Erollisi and fellow wood elf<br/>
defending his brethren against an evil pirate.  So I made the mistake of<br/>
singing Heal, anthem and chain targetting the pirate.  While attacking the<br/>
pirate I hear some battle cries from the sisters and think that they are<br/>
going to join us in the battle.  Boy was I wrong they slayed me and then<br/>
my cleric friend.  Was it me or was something totally wrong with this<br/>
picture?<br/>

&gt; Very good thought. I wish they would fix this, i really hate zoning in<br/>
&gt; from NFreeport to WFreeport (a spot where many guard killers pull to, i<br/>
&gt; am always apprehensive that i will get a bad faction hit just running by<br/>
&gt; a battle (as has happenned with GOOD faction MANY times).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is another thing to chew on: when i was 6th level, i was killing<br/>
&gt; spiders on the plateau in NRO. After a bad fight, i ran to the guard<br/>
&gt; near the plateau, and started my hymn to heal and sat. I got<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; your wounds begin to heal<br/>
&gt; your wounds begin to heal<br/>
&gt; your wounds begin to heal<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  and then i saw &quot;Stop you filty scum&quot; (or some such thing), and THE<br/>
&gt; GUARD attacked and killed me quickly. I scrolled back up to see what i<br/>
&gt; had done, and i had done NOTHING. I had ok faction with the guards, i<br/>
&gt; did not have the guard targeted, i was not in combat, and i was singing<br/>
&gt; ONLY the hymn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just something that has botheered me for a while...<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I actually think part of &quot;bard hate&quot; comes from a coding error (theory only). If I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am playing heal and a mob runs through our group<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting pulled to another group, I will get all the Faction +/-&#39;s for that mob<br/>
&gt; &gt; being killed. I think this was because in Beta the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bards songs affected everyone (grouped or not) within a certain radius. I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; this area effect code is still in the game but with<br/>
&gt; &gt; an additional check (i.e. in radius + in group) for PC&#39;s but for aggro mobs I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think they effectively get &quot;hit&quot; by our songs (thus we<br/>
&gt; &gt; get those faction hits for mobs we never touched). Thoughts?<br/>
