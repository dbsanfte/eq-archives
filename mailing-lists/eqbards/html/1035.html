<div id="ygrps-yiv-962675975">A bonus related to Paw is you don&#39;t have to go far to sell your loot. <br/>
There&#39;s a Centaur camp in S Karana and in one of the houses there resides a <br/>
named Centaur who also doubles as a merchant.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if the named Aviak in the South West corner of the zone sells <br/>
too - he doesn&#39;t like me.<br/>
The centaur camp is roughly in the north east part of the S Karanas zone - <br/>
turn left when you come OFF the bridge and head inland slightly, should <br/>
find it after a couple of minutes.<br/>

	My friends . . . many of you are asking for great places to hunt, and so I<br/>
woulod like to make a single recommendatin that I KNOW will work. Starting<br/>
at Level 12, go to Paw. You won&#39;t regret it.<br/>
<br/>
	I got enough loot AND experience there (at the same time) to stay there<br/>
from Level 13 to until I got Level 19. And on Fenin Ro there is NEVER<br/>
anyone there (2 people at 8:00 in the evening one night, amazing).<br/>
<br/>
	Before I describe the place let me just say that I finished my banded set<br/>
at Level 14, and finished my bronze platemail set at Level 18. I bought my<br/>
first combine longsword at Level 15, and my second at Level 17. I still<br/>
have 200 plat left over.<br/>
<br/>
	And this was all solo . . .<br/>
<br/>
	Buy about 4 backpacks, you&#39;ll need them.<br/>
<br/>
	Paw is the home of the Splitpaw Gnolls. You can find it by heading<br/>
directly south when you cross into S Karana from the Bridge from N Karana.<br/>
You will in time see hills and some rock spires that look like a Paw. There<br/>
is a cave which leads to the zone entrance.<br/>
<br/>
	At the entrance you will find Gnolls. Probably Level 8-10 or so. Most will<br/>
ignore you.<br/>
<br/>
	Eventually you will meet guards . . . which you can easily solo, and for<br/>
good exp. They are level 10-12 maybe. They may have cloth armor. Keep it.<br/>
They may have rusty weapons. Get used to destroying them, not worth their<br/>
weight.<br/>
<br/>
	You will also find Shamans. These are pretty weak, also about level 10-12.<br/>
They carry much better loot. Keep gems, they are lightweight and valuable.<br/>
The wooden totems sell for a plat a piece. The only weapon you should keep<br/>
is the occasional cracked staff, which also sell for 1 plat.<br/>
<br/>
	Eventually, you will be able to take nobles. They are Level 13-15. They<br/>
carry cloth, gems, but also Snakeskin Armor, which sells for about 7 plat<br/>
for each piece to other players.<br/>
<br/>
	After that, you will find there are two big rooms which are often camped<br/>
and which you should camp if you can. One room has three nobles, one<br/>
Captain (Level 16) and High Shaman Lenrel (Level 16 or 17). Lenrel carries<br/>
a Runed Totem Staff sometimes. Those sell for about 30 plat to other<br/>
players. The other room has two nobles, three commanders (Level 15 or 16),<br/>
and High Shaman Ren&#39;Rex. Rex also drops a staff from time to time. Captains<br/>
and commanders drop snakeskin often.<br/>
<br/>
	Use your lull song ALL the time. There is a place with 4 shamans and 2<br/>
guards that I basically lived for two levels. I would lull up to 4 of em<br/>
and take the other two one at a time. Worked great.<br/>
<br/>
	The real kicker? Gnolls hate water. They won&#39;t swim after you to try to<br/>
kill you. And almost everywhere is close enough to water to get there<br/>
before you die. So trouble does not mean death.<br/>
<br/>
	There are some other secret places, and other things you will figure out<br/>
(some monk quests as well). But this should be good enough.<br/>
<br/>
	Oh, and get used to being encumbered. Yes you can carry about 50 over your<br/>
weight limit and still win every fight again things that con blue.<br/>
<br/>
	Good luck!<br/>
