<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339582603">Well, I finally drug myself away from the aviaks in South Karana long enough<br/>
to venture into Permafrost last night.  <br/>
<br/>
First off, I couldn&#39;t find the secret passage which lets you avoid the ice<br/>
giants, so I decided to be gutsy.  I flicked on Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>
and ventured into the passage.  Conned the ice giants and they were<br/>
indifferent (woohoo! and do they look stupid or what?).<br/>
<br/>
Walked into perma and wandered around into the king&#39;s room conning<br/>
everything as I went.  Conned a few things and noticed an ice goblin prelate<br/>
and ice goblin patriarch which could both see me.  At this point I back off<br/>
and got a few wind skill increases, and waited while a nice level 41<br/>
magician broke into the king&#39;s room.<br/>
<br/>
Noticed the magician died and decided to scout the king&#39;s room again.  At<br/>
this point, I conned the ice goblin prelate again and this time he was<br/>
indifferent.  The magician came running back in at this point and<br/>
successfully broke the spawn, so I joined him in the lower part of the room<br/>
to wait.<br/>
<br/>
The next ice goblin patriarch that popped was indifferent to me also.  Never<br/>
did get those icy greaves, but I did pick up a Frost Totem (not a bad item,<br/>
part of the crafted boots quest, but bards can use for +10 sv frost and a<br/>
small amount of mana).<br/>
<br/>
So my question is this, was something in the king&#39;s room casting see invis,<br/>
or did those skill increases in wind get me to the point where I was invis<br/>
to more things?  If the second is the case, I would recommend that you try<br/>
to max that wind skill if you&#39;re having problems with not being invis to<br/>
certain mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for those bards who haven&#39;t been to perma and want to get those icy<br/>
greaves, I never was invis to the elite goblin guards, so you&#39;ll need to<br/>
make sure someone is camping the king&#39;s room or bring along some higher<br/>
level guys to help you out.<br/>
