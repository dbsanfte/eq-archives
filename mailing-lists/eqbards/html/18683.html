<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Oven located... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-935696972"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;There IS an oven in the Temple of Droga<br/>
&gt;in a goblin building waaay in the back in a section of the dungeon that is<br/>
&gt;hidden behind a secret wall.  I opened it and it is a standard six-slot<br/>
&gt;oven.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been confirmed by one of my friends.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In addition to the oven, when I was there one of the guards standing<br/>
&gt;directly to the right of the door leading into the space where the oven is<br/>
&gt;had a BOOK.  He was the &quot;goblin fanatic&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The book is called the Book of Rings.  He also drops a shoulder piece.  Both<br/>
I believe are druid quest items.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One interesting sidebar is that the Jail has a Pottery Wheel in a jail cell<br/>
&gt;behind a locked door.  Now this is probably for another quest or something,<br/>
&gt;but it raises the remote possibility in my mind that we might have to make<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bundt Cake Pan.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This pottery wheel I&#39;ve also seen second hand.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;When I was there (alone and invis) nothing attacked me and I had free run<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the place.  I don&#39;t recall seeing any mobs other than goblins except for a<br/>
&gt;couple of Iksar prisoners in a jail (i.e. no lone Burynai Prisoner or<br/>
&gt;something that might drop some Burynai Meat).  Word of advice: I fell into<br/>
&gt;the pit trap located on the map pointed to in this thread.  You fall into a<br/>
&gt;jail cell and into a locked room.  Presumably if you kill the three goblins<br/>
&gt;in this room one or more will drop a key for you.  I didn&#39;t find out<br/>

 </span></blockquote>first<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;couple the wandering goblin was kind enough to open the locked doors for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;so I scooted out invis and didn&#39;t have to fight.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Within the jail is a &#39;goblin penmaster&#39; who drops a key and a necklace.<br/>
When id&#39;d, the necklace is called Droga Primary Pen, and the key is Droga<br/>
Secondary Pen.  I&#39;m assuming these are keys to the jail.  I didn&#39;t get to<br/>
try them out however.  I had good experience with invis up until we reached<br/>
the stone bridge/entrance to the jail area.  It seemed that everything back<br/>
there saw through my invis and a 49 druid&#39;s camo.  We didn&#39;t walk up and<br/>
wave at them though, we con&#39;d them from afar.<br/>
<br/>
Woohoo! progress!! =)<br/>
<br/>
PS I finally got a Selo&#39;s drum...yay for patch day! =)<br/>
