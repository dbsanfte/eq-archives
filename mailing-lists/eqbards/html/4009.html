a bard.  If you start to run low on stamina and the group has<br/>
plenty of tanks, it&#39;s not out of the question for you to swap<br/>
your weapons for a lute and start weaving Hymn for the added<br/>
healing bonus while you &quot;rest up.&quot;  You may also be surprised<br/>
how effective your group can be with you using an instrument.<br/>

At L28 if I run low on stamina while soloing, I just hit the<br/>
monster I&#39;m fighting with Pixie Strike over and over while I<br/>
rest and heal.  :-)<br/>

Pugius.  But ever since Dvinn started dropping the Dragoon<br/>
Dirk every time due to a bug (since fixed), the bottom has<br/>
dropped out of the prices on low-to-mid end piercing weapons.<br/>
<br/>
If it weren&#39;t for the Dirk, I&#39;d put the price on a Pugius at<br/>
around 80-100pp.  But with the Dirk selling for 35pp, I&#39;d say<br/>
25pp is about right.<br/>
