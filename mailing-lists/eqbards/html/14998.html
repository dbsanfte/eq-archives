<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012947644">&lt;blushes&gt; You are welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Just glad I could be of some help.  Well, if you call that help.  The whole<br/>
thing woulda gone a lot better had we just sat at the &#39;stuck rock&#39; for 15 or<br/>
20 minutes and let the little bastiage come to us.  But, oh no, I am a bard<br/>
and I have tracking!  So, off I went, cruising thru HG valley, popping up<br/>
tracking, not really looking in front too much when I agro&#39;d a Clops.  Hmm,<br/>
should be not problem, I&#39;ll just run out of his agro range.<br/>
<br/>
So, I took another lap around HG Hill and then I saw you, another clops, a<br/>
giant skell and the first clops closing in from behind.  So, I ran over to<br/>
fear them off, thinking we&#39;d fear and fight them one at a time. Well, when I<br/>
got there, I saw you had found Hasten and did not think that you might have<br/>
Divine Aura up and not worried about some pesky clops.  Hey, it was like 1am<br/>
for me and I was not thinking too quick.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, it was too late and I feared Hasten as well as the clopsi & g-skel.<br/>
So, I figgered I&#39;d take the clops for a run while you did business with<br/>
Hasten.  Hmmm, about 3 bubs of hp later, I realized that little old Hasten<br/>
hits pretty good for a gnome!  And trained him around the hill a couple<br/>
times.  Finally, the best plan I could come up with was to train them all to<br/>
the Feer zone and let you find them pinned there.<br/>
<br/>
By now you had Atoned the clops and skels and was working on Hasten? The<br/>
best laid plans of bards and clerics sometimes (all the time?) go astray.<br/>
So, then I figgered I&#39;d just let Hasten kill me right by the stuck rock.<br/>
Somehow you took the death but after that everything was non-agro.  So,<br/>
Grifter hailed Hasten and kept him occupied while you made your way back and<br/>
did the bootie quest.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to turn a simple quest into total chaos, gimme a call - I can<br/>
pretty much do it every time!<br/>

&gt; My cleric got jboots last night.  I would like to publicly thank<br/>
&gt; Sylly for training cyclops arounded rathe mountains while I did my quest.<br/>
&gt; And I know both of us came out of this experience with one gem of<br/>
&gt; knowledge:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Screech does indeed affect Hasten Bootstrutter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That was the most interesting chase I&#39;ve had in a long time :).<br/>
