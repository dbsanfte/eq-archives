<div id="ygrps-yiv-409885267">I too have had this same problem several times in the last week, what I have<br/>
done about each time is to simply sit down.  I don&#39;t know if that would help<br/>
everyone, but it has always worked for me.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;    yesterday alone i encountered two separate occasions when i could not<br/>
&gt; sing a song due to another song being what appeared to be &quot;locked&quot; into<br/>
&gt; verse. now the peculiar thing was that one of these times, i was in east<br/>
&gt; commons grouped with another bard, and some others. i decided since i was<br/>

&gt; happened to me, so i didn&#39;t panic. i simply zoned. it seems to fix the<br/>
&gt; problem, but isn&#39;t necessarily something you want to do while either<br/>
&gt; fighting some mobs, or trying to heal your party while preparing for the<br/>
&gt; next battle.<br/>

&gt; from him and still kept getting the message &quot;your wounds begin to heal.&quot;<br/>
&gt; hmmm... i left clicked on the icon to try removing the effects that way.<br/>
&gt; also no luck. well since i was at the zone, i went ahead and did the sure<br/>
&gt; fix.<br/>
&gt;    is this happening with any other bards? what could be the problem?<br/>
