<div id="ygrps-yiv-674972822">The trick to using the AOE songs is to go to 3rd party view.  I used to<br/>
fight at orc camp in East Commons and in 3rd person view learned the range.<br/>
Initially you&#39;ll get extra critters you don&#39;t want - and my have to run to<br/>
zone to clear agro.  But eventually you&#39;ll get a good feel for it - and<br/>
learn just not to pulse the song in your twist as extra mobs pass by.<br/>

Learnin to use Area Effect songs early in your career is a big plus.  I was<br/>
scared from too many times singing chords to Corporal Lancot and just<br/>
avoided these good songs for way too long.  Yes,</div>
