&gt; Hey!  I was complaining about them taking away surfing<br/>
&gt; well before they actually did it!  They kept saying they<br/>
&gt; were going to &quot;fix&quot; it, and I&#39;ve been feedbacking it for a<br/>
&gt; month saying I didn&#39;t want it to happen. So I&#39;m allowed!  <br/>
&gt; For those who care, don&#39;t get your hopes up that they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; take it out.  For them to go through all the effort to fix<br/>
&gt; it in the first place suggests that they really think that<br/>
&gt; this graphic is a lot better.  No accounting for taste, is<br/>
&gt; there?<br/>

move so fast that the side-to-side wiggle of my torso looks<br/>
like something out of a Keystone Kops film.<br/>
