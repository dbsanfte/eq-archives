<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454142287">We decided to take a shot at Lady Vox on Saturday.  Eventually, we scraped<br/>
together enough folks to make a decent raiding party but all the old<br/>
&#39;issues&#39; came back to haunt us: i.e. ineffectiveness of &lt;49 level folks; not<br/>
enough 50&#39;s; etc.<br/>
<br/>
Things were going pretty good and most of the folks had arrived and we we in<br/>
ad hoc groups - just hanging around slapping the IGD and the first couple<br/>
IG&#39;s.  A level 51 Rogue decided to &#39;check things out&#39; and some how agro&#39;d<br/>
the whole lair.  He yelled over /gu &quot;DONT HEAL ME!&quot;  He was gonna eat a<br/>
death but either a guest or someone just missed the call and attacked<br/>
something.  Well, that began one of the most chaotic and uncontrolled<br/>
battles that I have ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
There were like 5 or 6+ IG&#39;s inc Priest of Nagafen and Magus, two icy<br/>
terrors, a wooly spider and of course the king room gobs respawned and<br/>
joined the battle.  Clerics and other casters were getting interrupted by<br/>
these green pests while an epic battle took place.  People were ungrouped<br/>
and just calling for heals and whatever.  Thank the gods that most of these<br/>
folks had alot of playing experience and this was not their &#39;first time.&#39;<br/>
Folks knew enough to try to root and separate as best they could under<br/>
totally insane conditions.  Everyone was playing their finest desparation<br/>
tactics.<br/>
<br/>
And when the dust settled, we stood around for a bit saying &quot;I can&#39;t believe<br/>
we won that!&quot;  We lost about half the troops but we prevailed in the end.<br/>
After that, we buffed for Vox and charged her in the lair.  Unfortunately,<br/>
we just did not have enough of everything to take her down.  She chealed on<br/>
us and eventually killed us all.  In the post battle analysis, if the one<br/>
rogue with the Ragebringer had not LD&#39;d, if we had more than 2 enchanters to<br/>
sieve, if we just did more damage fasster... yadda, yadda. Vox 1, &#39;twinks&#39;<br/>
0.  But there is always next time!<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. a 53 cleric took 2 deaths from the gobs to &quot;die down&quot; a level so she<br/>
could fight Vox.  Things you thought you&#39;d never hear on guildsay: &quot;WOOT! I<br/>
just lost a level!!!&quot;<br/>

The non-technical term we use for how we kill Nag/Vox is &quot;gimps&quot;. I bring my<br/>
<br/>
49th Rogue to raids. At least half of the people involved in our raids are <br/>
&lt;53 secondary characters. We almost always have 53+ <br/>
clerics/shamans/enchanters present to buff us, though, and I usually bring <br/>
the bard for pumping mana into the buffing team. You can also use the scales<br/>
<br/>
from Ragefire if you have any clerics working on their epic quest.<br/>

&gt;above level 52. </span></blockquote></div>
