&gt;Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a level 16 Bard who is seeking a good place for experience at my<br/>
&gt;level.  Currently I am at Unrest and the experience is very small for my<br/>
&gt;level.  I know there are some great things to hunt in there, but I am not<br/>
&gt;strong enough yet.  Does anyone know of good place for me to hunt that<br/>
&gt;will advance my levels at a decent pace?  Unrest was really good when I<br/>
&gt;was lvl14.  Any suggestions?<br/>

near the southern edge of the oasis in the Oasis of Marr zone, and area <br/>
where the orcs roam but Sand Giants didn&#39;t - the xp and loot FLOWED...BUT, <br/>
while my party was there one day (during phase 4 beta), a GM appeared (I <br/>
forget his name, but he was a high elf wizard Guide) and was watching us do <br/>
our thing.<br/>
<br/>
I was pulling orcs non-stop from the sand pit areas for our party to kill, <br/>
we  barely needed to rest. He said he was very pleased to see such a <br/>
successful group in action. Well, we didn&#39;t think much of it (we were all <br/>
sure we were doing nothing wrong, but he kinda made everyone wonder why he <br/>
was spending so much time standing there - he could&#39;ve been helping someone <br/>
who needed GM/Guide assistance).<br/>
<br/>
So the next day we went back to the spot to hunt, and shortly we were beset <br/>
by Sand Giants (obviously Verant altered the patrol routes for SG&#39;s so they <br/>
would keep people on their toes), we had to retreat, and every time we tried <br/>
that spot, SOMEONE ended up getting chased by an SG - so we gave up.<br/>
<br/>
Crocs in the Oasis are very popular for getting xp but loot SUCKS. Some <br/>
people like hunting dervishes - I hear they sometimes drop bronze.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite spots is the rocky area between the Aviak Roost and the <br/>
Lake Rathe zone. I would definitely suggest having a ranger with you when <br/>
hunting in the plains. You can hunt Aviak Darters, Egrets, and Rooks if you <br/>
have a good group. Rooks drop decent loot sometimes (rarely a darter might <br/>
drop something very nice). Elephants (especially bulls) can yield decent xp <br/>
but not decent loot. The Centaurs are also good but they can be tough. <br/>
Centaur archers can drop medium ringmail sometimes, but they are tough (and <br/>
they one of the WEAKER centuars).<br/>
<br/>
At 16th you can also hunt gnoll elites and commanders in Blackburrow, or try <br/>
for some ice goblins in permafrost (dangerous place though).<br/>
I&#39;m not real familiar with Guk as I didn&#39;t like that place much<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few places all on Antonica. If you are no Faydwer you could <br/>
go for the higher level CB orcs, or if you have big cajones, try Mistmoore <br/>
(I wouldn&#39;t advise it until later though).<br/>
