 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Is it true that whoever wins the duel can loot items off of your body?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  It used to be the winner was allowed one item.  But now you may not<br/>
loot the body at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. Is there any way to cancel a duel after both people have accepted the<br/>
&gt; duel?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  There is no time expiration or anything like that.  Once both people<br/>
agree on a duel, it does not end until one person dies or flees (zones).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. Is it against Verant&#39;s rules to have outsiders buff a player while he/she<br/>
&gt; is dueling? (I wouldn&#39;t do this, but I&#39;d worry about the person I&#39;m dueling<br/>
&gt; doing it)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dueling is stirctly between the two people.  No one else may interfere in<br/>
anyway.  PvP or not, grouped or not, the fight is only between the 2.  I<br/>
take that back, if there is another NPC nearby, it might decide to join<br/>
in.  The no interference rule only applies to other PC&#39;s.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5b. If you&#39;re in a group with another Bard and you&#39;re dueling, will their<br/>
&gt; songs affect you during the duel?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re grouped, then only bellow will work.  Most of the bard songs are<br/>
either non-party only or party only.  So you probably don&#39;t want to due<br/>
another bard until you disband.  On a side note, when you&#39;re in a duel,<br/>
you may not heal/buff other people in your group either (unless one of<br/>
them is dueling you) until the duel is over.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6. If you&#39;re dueling in a PVP area, can other people enter the fight?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, a duel is strictly one-on-one.  If you&#39;re looking for a brawl, you <br/>
can go to one of those PvP area and start fighting without issuing or<br/>
accepting a duel.</div>
