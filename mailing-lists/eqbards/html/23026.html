<div id="ygrps-yiv-761104168">The only times I have ever used the Cancel Magic songs in a combat situation<br/>
is when fighting spiders in the Dreadlands to get rid of their damage<br/>
shield.  A caster with Nullify magic can get rid of the entire damage shield<br/>
in one fell swoop.  I would have to sing Cancel Magic a couple of times<br/>
before it was completely removed.  So damage shields have the counters like<br/>
Shada mentioned.  Not certain which other spell effects have counters.<br/>
Seems kinda strange that an illusion would have a counter though.  When I<br/>
have used Cancel Magic to remove DE illusion, I would get the &quot;static pulse&quot;<br/>
message (i.e. I didn&#39;t resist myself) but the illusion remained in effect.<br/>
Only after using Cancel Magic a couple of times would it go away.  BTW I<br/>
think Shada may be right that Cancel Magic is unresistable.  When I first<br/>
got my Nostrolos Tamborine, I tried the various Chant songs on myself to see<br/>
how much damage they did.  It took me several attempts to finally get a<br/>
Chant to stick.  With the Cancel Magic song, I get the &quot;static pulse&quot;<br/>
message indicating success every time I have used it on myself.<br/>
<br/>
The question I have is do both of our songs that remove spell effects work<br/>
in the same manner (with the exception that one affects the entire party<br/>
while one is targetted).  In other words, if I want to get rid of root, do<br/>
both of them give me the same chance?  I have a feeling that Disenchanting<br/>
Melody picks a random effect to remove while Cancel Magic removes the one at<br/>
the top of your screen.  Does anyone know for certain?<br/>

i thought dispels were unresistable, but certain spell effects had X number<br/>
of counters and you need to dispel X number of times to get them off.  but<br/>
the short answer is yes, both of our dispel songs removed effects on us<br/>
(positive or negative) other than illusions before patch.  i haven&#39;t tried<br/>
since.  i&#39;m not sure if it goes in order on your effects box or what order<br/>
they were cast on you or if it&#39;s random.  i thought they made it random<br/>
around the same type they made Vox and Nag AE dispel.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The problem with using our Cancel Magic song to remove spell <br/>
&gt; effects is that<br/>
&gt; it checks against your MR.  I think, but am not 100% certain, <br/>
&gt; that Cancel<br/>
&gt; Magic will always remove the first spell effect.  So if you <br/>
&gt; are rooted, in<br/>
&gt; order to get rid of it the root icon needs to be listed <br/>
&gt; first.  Then the<br/>
&gt; song has to actually succeed a MR check.  When I want to remove my DE<br/>
&gt; illusion, I usually have to try 2-3 times before the song sticks. <br/>
