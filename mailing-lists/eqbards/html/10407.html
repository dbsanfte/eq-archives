<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086969439">no perhaps not a petition, i used the wrong wording there.  all i meant was<br/>
possibly a follow-up letter to GZ from the bards list with the skill cap<br/>
issue.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t mean to sound like I&#39;m disagreeing with you (I agree <br/>
&gt; 100 pct) - but<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t really see the need for a petition.  As far as bards <br/>
&gt; are concerned -<br/>
&gt; who&#39;d vote AGAINST it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We definitely should start think about sending another GZ <br/>
&gt; letter - and this<br/>
&gt; belongs on it...<br/>
