<div id="ygrps-yiv-170184930">people have done this solo, as long as you can chant kite while blind heh.<br/>
i took a 56 ranger and 53 druid friends.  i was going to try solo, but they<br/>
were in the same zone.  i hardly ever solo, so i would have probably died or<br/>
tried running my ass off blind.  we single pulled the greens with harmony.<br/>
used sneak to turn in the item, and the cool thing was that maligar was<br/>
still harmonied, so when the doppelganger spawned maligar didn&#39;t join in the<br/>
fight.  his dark gets through even super high MR, but 2 friends 50+ should<br/>
be more than enough.<br/>

&gt; guards were green to<br/>
&gt; me.  At least three agroed on me when I got into their range. <br/>
&gt;  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
&gt; if Maligar was one of them.  I am a bit loathe to try again, <br/>
&gt; as I would have<br/>
&gt; bit it that time if I hadn&#39;t had boffo hp (had just come from <br/>
&gt; killing Vox,<br/>
&gt; got a magic bag!).<br/>
