One difference the others have not mentioned is that you<br/>
cannot re-charm a mob that is already charmed.  You have to<br/>
wait for it to uncharm (and thus give it a chance to hit you),<br/>
then re-charm it.  You *can* re-strike a mob that&#39;s already<br/>
under the effect of Pixie Strike.  You can &quot;pause&quot; a mob<br/>
pretty much indefinitely by Striking it over and over,<br/>
although high blues and higher seem to resist enough to make<br/>
this a dicey strategy.<br/>
