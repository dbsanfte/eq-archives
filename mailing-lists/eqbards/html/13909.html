<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791906339">I read that and I laughed. The warrior must of had a lapse in memory and<br/>
forgot to push the attack key. I had two 50 warriors duel  my pet. First was<br/>
a human yes human warrior. She did however have the obtenrate claymore<br/>
(sp? ) and mith arms but other then that normal equip. She lossed 2 bubs my<br/>
pet got crushed. The other was a barb warrior with a mith two hander he lost<br/>
1 bub. He crushed my pet. I think the warrior was duel wielding yekeshas and<br/>
proc is nerfed in duels so they go off a lot less. That was probably why he<br/>
lossed besides a shadowknight friend ran some tests. He and a warrior duel<br/>
wielding yekeshas were soloing the ghoul lord in upper guk, he drops the<br/>
ghoulbane. The warrior would constantly be having the lord on him even<br/>
though neither of them were taunting. Anyhow the shadowknight not using<br/>
spells took 5 out of 8 kills using a mith two hander. So maybe those yaks<br/>
aren&#39;t so good after all.<br/>

&gt;The way I see it, the primary purpose of a pet should be to act as a<br/>
&gt;defensive barrier between the mob and the caster.  In other words, the pet<br/>
&gt;keeps stuff off of the caster so the caster&#39;s spell don&#39;t get interrupted.<br/>
&gt;This does not necessarily mean the pet is inflicting a lot of damage.  The<br/>
&gt;primary source of damage that the mob gets hit for should come from the<br/>
&gt;caster&#39;s spells, not the pet.  If the mob starts to attack the caster, the<br/>
&gt;pet should a built in Taunt skill to draw the mob off the caster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just started up a newbie magician the other day so my opinion is subject<br/>
&gt;to change 180 degrees as I play him more:-)<br/>

&gt;PS There was a recent post on the official EQ site from a 50 warrior who<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;dueled a 50 necro.  The only thing the necro did was sic his pet on the<br/>
&gt;warrior.  He didn&#39;t cast any spells.  The necro pet won:-).  Abashi&#39;s<br/>
&gt;response was that the warrior didn&#39;t have the right equipment for a 50<br/>
&gt;warrior (warrior was in crafted) and that he must not have used a good<br/>
&gt;strategy against the pet.  I was always under the impression that there<br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t much strategy to playing a warrior. Hit AutoAttack and start pushing<br/>
&gt;the bash/slam/kick/taunt buttons.  Despite what Abashi said, IMO a pet<br/>
&gt;should never beat or even come close to beating an equal level melee class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PPS Is this the list record for longest OT thread?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Heh bards aren&#39;t melee classes they don&#39;t even have double attack and<br/>
&gt;&gt; until<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; you get a yekeshas or two you can&#39;t do much.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Naeeldar<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s my point.  Necros aren&#39;t melee classes either, and are<br/>
&gt;&gt; supposed to be less of a melee class than bards.  Therefore it<br/>
&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t make sense that they have the ability to do more melee<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage than bards.<br/>
