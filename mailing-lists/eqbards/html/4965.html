<div id="ygrps-yiv-896570509">That someone is Macneal Jacob (sp?) he is on duty in the backroom.  With so<br/>
much traffic going through there, you&#39;d think that he would be [running low]<br/>
- next time you are there - ask him about his inventory and see if he is<br/>
[low] - hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. you can get 2 quests in one done with this trail.  You just need to<br/>
know which ranger in Surefall Glade gets the gnoll head - but once you have<br/>
Gnasher&#39;s head I think you can just axe around til you find the right one.<br/>
Also - u can read the notes that you get handed by giving them a quick right<br/>
click - interesting info sometimes.<br/>

		If you turn them in to someone at the bar where Trumpy<br/>

		hangs out, you can get yourself a flask of the banned<br/>

		As far as I know there&#39;s no jewelery you can make from them<br/>
		(though I&#39;m not a jeweler).<br/>
