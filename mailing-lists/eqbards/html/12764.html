<b>Subject:</b> A new /who command (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-187547947">Here is an idea I posted on alt.games.everquest newsgroup.  The few replies<br/>
it generated were all positive.  Let me know what you think and maybe it is<br/>
something else we can post on the official EQ message board.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see a new /who command added to the game.  The command would<br/>
work like this.  You type in /who &quot;zone name&quot; and it tells you who all is in<br/>
that zone.  As it stands right now, you can only find out who is in the zone<br/>
you are currently in.  This command would be a tremendous benefit to every<br/>
player in the game, especially those without teleport and gate capabilities.<br/>
Here is a prime example of its usefulness.  You log in to play and are in<br/>
Highpass.  Not much action there so you decide you want to go to either<br/>
Cazic Thule or Permafrost.  Getting to Cazic requires you to cross six<br/>
zones.  Getting to Perma requires you to also cross six zones.  If you are a<br/>
class that has to run the entire distance, lets assume its gonna take you<br/>
about 30 minutes to get to either place.  You decide to go to Permafrost but<br/>
when you arrive there isn&#39;t anyone in their for you to group with.  You just<br/>
wasted at least an hour of playing time (30 minutes to get there plus the<br/>
time to now run to Cazic).  Time spent needlessly running is not fun, no<br/>
matter which class you play.  <br/>
<br/>
A /who command that allowed you to see the zone population of zones outside<br/>
the zone you are presently in would prevent a situation like this occuring.<br/>
While still in Highpass, you type in /who permafrost.  You could then send<br/>
/tell messages to someone in the zone near your level to see if you can join<br/>
their group.  If you don&#39;t have luck with Permanfrost, you can then type in<br/>
/who cazic and try there.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any way this would affect any class balance issue.<br/>
Assuming that class balance is not affected in any manner by adding this<br/>
/who command, the only reason I can think of to not implement it is that it<br/>
is too hard to code.  <br/>
