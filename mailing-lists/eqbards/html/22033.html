<div id="ygrps-yiv-187708367">If it helps any, I&#39;m 46 and both the gloves and the boots work for me.  I <br/>
got the boots in the same raid that I got out of 45, so I&#39;m not 100% sure, <br/>
but I think they worked at 45 also.<br/>
<br/>
Hehe, I thought I was too young for the gloves when they didn&#39;t work when I <br/>
tried right-clicking them.  Funny things is, while playing selo&#39;s and <br/>
right-clicking the gloves I got a message about how I could not activate the <br/>
effect while singing.<br/>
<br/>
I was helping a shaman friend try to complete the Test of Patience portion <br/>
of his epic quest.  If you don&#39;t know, you&#39;re supposed to wait underwater <br/>
for several minutes for this Ogre&#39;s friends to show up.  I was wearing the <br/>
gloves and had the shaman cast EB on me... hehe  Thought it was weird when <br/>
EB wore off that I didn&#39;t get the Air Remaining thing, but I just kicked in <br/>
the water breathing song anyway... hehe  Anyway the mobs never showed up, so <br/>
he failed the test of patience... hehe<br/>
