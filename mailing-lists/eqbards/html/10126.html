<div id="ygrps-yiv-651280972">Hey everybody,<br/>
<br/>
Got to spend the last four days playing EQ thanks to the federal holiday.<br/>
Played more this past weekend than I have in the previous month.  Had the<br/>
most fun I&#39;ve ever had playing EQ so wanted to pass on what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday: <br/>
<br/>
Well Thursday actually sucked.  Played for about eight hours in pickup<br/>
groups that didn&#39;t really know what they were doing and ended up dying<br/>
twice.  Should have cleaned the house instead of playing EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Friday:<br/>
<br/>
Some guildmates and I decided to go to Sol A and try and get armor quest<br/>
components.  I needed the fiery vambraces and fiery boots and a cleric<br/>
needed a molten cloak.   In addition to me and the cleric, also had a druid<br/>
with us.  The cleric and the druid were both 35th level and we were hoping<br/>
to recruit when we got there.  Zoned into Sol A around 4PM Friday afternoon.<br/>
There were a whopping 10 people in the zone.  The other seven were all super<br/>
high level characters (at least four 50th level players) and were all deep<br/>
inside the dungeon.  We pretty much had the entire dungeon to ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
This was the first time into Sol A for both me and the druid.  This was<br/>
evident by the druid falling into the lava within five minutes of our<br/>
revival.  She ended up dying because she didn&#39;t have gate or levitate<br/>
memmed.  Found someone who could levitate me so I got the chance to play<br/>
hero.  Got the levitate, located the corpse with the song, hovered out over<br/>
the lava, and was able to pull the corpse back to near the swing blade trap.<br/>
Apparently summoning a corpse is not affected by how high you are.  Think of<br/>
it as the z-axis bug actually helping you out in this type of situation.  I<br/>
was ten feet over the lava and was able to summon a corpse on the bottom of<br/>
the lava pit.  To say the least the druid was quite relieved and I made a<br/>
friend for life.  The druid offered me free teleports whenever I wanted<br/>
them:-)<br/>
<br/>
We then moved on to where the molten cloak was alledgely dropped using invis<br/>
song.  Was doing OK when another guildmate arrived at Sol A.  Decided to go<br/>
back to zone entrance to pick him up.  Someone got out of invis song range<br/>
and all hell broke loose.  Goblins were all over us.  Told the cleric and<br/>
druid to gate out which they did.  That left me in the middle of Sol A<br/>
completely lost with a bunch of goblins whacking on me.  Time to see just<br/>
how good this fear song works.  Calmly equipped the horn and started<br/>
tooting.  Next thing I know goblins are running in every direction.  I<br/>
started searching for my way out, screeching the entire time.  The place<br/>
looked like a hornets nest.  Finally got my bearings and knew how to get<br/>
out.  Was about halfway back when more goblins decided they wanted to mess<br/>
with me.  I just kept on Screeching.  Finally made it to the zone and still<br/>
had over half my health.  I think I had about 30-40 goblins pissed at me<br/>
though when I finally zoned:-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway linked up with the other two plus picked up a paladin.  Went back<br/>
inside and immediately got a shout from someone saying fiery vambraces were<br/>
available for free loot.  I told him I would like them but had no idea where<br/>
to find him.  He came and picked me up at the zone and led me to the corpse.<br/>
The guy who gave them to me was a 50th ranger.  Asked him what he wanted in<br/>
reutrn and he said to just let him know if we saw an inferno wizard appear.<br/>
They drop something for a ranger quest.  Told him we would.  On the way back<br/>
out, our group ran into the solusek goblin king wandering a hallway.  We all<br/>
saw the word &quot;king&quot; and knew that we had stumbled on to something good.  I<br/>
won the lottery and looted a Scepter of Flame.  Can&#39;t remember the stats but<br/>
a pretty good 1HB weapon.  I have been playing since April.  This item was<br/>
the best I have ever looted before.  Couldn&#39;t really use it though since my<br/>
1HB skill is 1.  Ended up giving it to my cleric.  They were amazed that I<br/>
just gave it to them.  Told them I couldn&#39;t use it so why be greedy.  Must<br/>
have gotten some good karma from that act because as we made our way further<br/>
back we ran into a solusek mage.  Killed him and got the fiery boots on the<br/>
first try.  Here I was in Sol A less than an hour and I already had both<br/>
items I came for.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday:<br/>
<br/>
Watched Alabama beat Mississippi State.  Roll Tide.  Logged on and went to<br/>
the Karanas to find a giant hunting party.  Along the way (from Sol A),<br/>
shouted in each zone I wanted to buy a lambent stone.  People were trying to<br/>
get 150PP for them.  Told them good luck.  Got to North Karana and tried a<br/>
different approach.  Instead of asking to buy a lambent stone, shouted I<br/>
wanted to join a giant hunting party so I could acquire one.  Got a tell<br/>
from someone saying I could have a stone for free.  Thanked him and headed<br/>
to Freeport to buy some gems.  Sapphires cost me 105PP a piece with<br/>
indifferent faction from the jeweler in North Freeport.  Sang Carillon and<br/>
got her to amiable.  Still 105PP each.  Put on a +7 CHR bracer. Still 105PP.<br/>
Went ahead and bought two sapphires but was kinda pissed that I got the same<br/>
price with Carillon and +7CHR bracer as I did with nothing.  Anyway ended up<br/>
getting my first piece of lambent armor, the vambraces.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday:<br/>
<br/>
Grouped with some guildmates and went to North Karana.  Killed a griffon for<br/>
the first time and my karma from Friday carried over.  Got a lambent stone<br/>
from the griffon.  Will have to hold on to it for a while because buying the<br/>
two sapphires cost me everything I had.  Anyway went to Upper Guk and tried<br/>
to help a guildmate get a Ghoulbane.  Camped the spawn for two hours but no<br/>
luck.  Good experience though.  Had to camp for the night so thats where I&#39;m<br/>
at now.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion:<br/>
<br/>
1)  If you go to Sol A, its a good idea to have someone in your party who<br/>
can levitate.  <br/>
2)  Random acts of kindness are a good thing.  If you don&#39;t need an item,<br/>
give it to someone in your party who can.<br/>
3)  Never pay more than 20PP for a lambent stone.  <br/>
4)  A few others but this has gone on for too long and I need to actually do<br/>
some work today.<br/>
<br/>
Later<br/>
