<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778901867">My experience.  I am a level 46 Bard.  I have recently been hunting <br/>
with a Cleric (44) friend.  Our strategy was simple.  He would root <br/>
and I would stand back and sing Fulfils, Chant of Flame, and Chant of <br/>
Frost.  Never once did a creature break root because of the damage on <br/>
these songs.  The cleric even commented how nice it was that his root <br/>
was lasting for full durations.  We fought in Burning Wood, the Mines <br/>
of Nurga, and Frontier Mountains.  A wide variety of creatures.  Our <br/>
toughest battle was against a Wurm in Burning Wood.  The Wurm <br/>
resisted a root and did seem to break a few early.<br/>
