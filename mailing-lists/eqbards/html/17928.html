Gordon announced what changes were in today&#39;s patch on the Gameplay<br/>
Board. Here&#39;s the info:<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s patch primarily contained preparations for Kunark, including<br/>
some new art. There was also a bug that was fixed with a bard song that<br/>
was put in last Tuesday. The song (a charm upgrade) was not capped.<br/>
Someone was kind enough to send us a screenshot of someone with a<br/>
*really nice* pet named Cazic-Thule.<br/>

<br/>
It tis a sad day when the husic of happy, joyous bards ceases across the<br/>
land.</div>
