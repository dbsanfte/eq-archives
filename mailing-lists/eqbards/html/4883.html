<div id="ygrps-yiv-519637955">Arrgh, rock and hard place.  The spoiler below may be vital to<br/>
any bard&#39;s ability to freely travel in Freeport.  If you<br/>
regularly group with paladins, I suggest you go ahead and read<br/>
it, as the spoiler is minor, but the grief it can save you is<br/>
immense.<br/>

&gt; Ok, so curiosity got the better of you I see 8)<br/>
&gt; Here is the story- there is a guard that spawns<br/>
&gt; in the bank named Krazen Loosh. The people are<br/>
&gt; all camping there waiting for him to spawn so<br/>
&gt; they can kill him. Apparently, the other guards<br/>
&gt; do not assist him. There is a minor faction hit<br/>
&gt; associated with killing Krazen but I have seen<br/>
&gt; people camp for a week without becoming KOS. <br/>
<br/>
Beware, this will make you KOS to the Freeport Militia.  They<br/>
are the guards in West and East Freeport.  The guards in North<br/>
Freeport are all paladins (except Krazen) which is why you do<br/>
not become KOS to them.  This is actually part of a bigger<br/>
plot, in which the paladins and the militia are both fighting<br/>
for control of Freeport.  Nearly anything that raises your<br/>
faction with the paladins lowers it with the militia, and vice<br/>
versa.<br/>
<br/>
If a member of your party is fighting Krazen, and any of your<br/>
party effect songs pulses during the fight, YOU will also get<br/>
the faction hit for killing Krazen.  So be careful if you&#39;re<br/>
at the bank and grouped with new people or any friends you<br/>
know who wish to kill Krazen (it&#39;s actually a paldin quest).<br/>
Once someone becomes KOS to the militia, they are KOS to<br/>
Krazen, so they may have to fight even if they don&#39;t want to.<br/>
