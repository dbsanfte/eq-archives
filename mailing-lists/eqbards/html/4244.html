<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696088414">Having a Magician character, I am quite familiar with the pet commands. Did<br/>
you try /pet back off ?<br/>
It&#39;s really the only command that will pull an engaged pet off of a target.<br/>
Keep in mind though that if the pet is attacked when it is returning to your<br/>
side, it will re-engage. I usually assign this command to a hot key, and<br/>
just wail on the key, until the pet is where I want it.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been playing with charm a lot lately (wonderful for<br/>
&gt;pulling a mob off someone it&#39;s frenzied against), and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;noticed a recurring problem.  Sometimes the mob you charm will<br/>
&gt;attack a player (a party member in all cases so far) and will<br/>
&gt;not stop despite repeated commands to sit down, follow me, or<br/>
&gt;attack another mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t been able to reproduce this at will, but I *think*<br/>
&gt;this happens when I charm a mob, order it to attack another<br/>
&gt;mob, it becomes uncharmed, a party member attacks it, and I<br/>
&gt;re-charm it.  I know it&#39;s not the command failing because the<br/>
&gt;charmed mob says the appropriate things but keeps right on<br/>
&gt;attacking.  Does anyone know what&#39;s up with this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We were almost killed by a cyclops last night because a stupid<br/>
&gt;kodiak tagged along and I wasted time trying to charm it to<br/>
&gt;take it out of the fight and it kept right on attacking.<br/>
&gt;(OTOH my ranger friend was absolutely ecstatic when the<br/>
&gt;cyclops frenzied on him, got him down to one bubble as the<br/>
&gt;cleric went OOM, and I charmed the cyclops to pull it off<br/>
&gt;him.)<br/>
