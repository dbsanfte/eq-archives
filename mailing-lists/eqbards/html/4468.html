<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022004314"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;   Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>
&gt; &gt; considering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More that the well balanced is horrifically overpriced. Try selling one<br/>
&gt; back to a vendor for a more realistic idea of it&#39;s true value. Everyone<br/>
&gt; I know who has bought a well balanced weapon regrets it and tells anyone<br/>
&gt; who will listen not to make the same mistake.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The prices on Dirks are going up anyway.  Last night I couldn&#39;t find<br/>
anyone willing to sell a Dirk for less than 60pp--and I went straight to<br/>
the source too.  Everyone blamed it on the LORE flag.  Go figure.<br/>
