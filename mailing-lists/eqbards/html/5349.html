Since we are close in levels, let me tell you what I have that is different<br/>
from you:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Banded Helm - not magic but I would hate to give up the 8AC points for the<br/>
&gt; much heavier blackened crown with less AC and the same silly half-elf<br/>
&gt; donut-looking graphic that I am tiring of.  I heard that Hatar (named low<br/>
&gt; 20s sand giant in Oasis) drops a Fine Silk Turban with 10AC .1 weight and<br/>
&gt; +10 fire resist that does not have a texturemap on my character, which<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; be cool if it is so, but I have never seen one to verify.  I would love a<br/>
&gt; crested helm for the looks and bonuses but I don&#39;t know where to find it<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; how much they are<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Another option is the Leatherfoot Raiders Cap that gives +10 CHR. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Banded Mask - Dying to get the Guise of the deceiver, guess I should go to<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; bazaar and hope for the best - can&#39;t go to lower guk yet at 24th<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I think the Guise is NO DROP.  I&#39;m looking forward to this one also.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Banded Tunic - Once again the AC can&#39;t be beat for a reasonable price<br/>
&gt; unless<br/>
&gt; I go to a medium bronze breastplate, and then the AC vs weight ratio seems<br/>
&gt; not worth the upgrade - steel is way out of my price range and obtaining<br/>
&gt; better items at my level is seemingly impossible unless I buy them - I am<br/>
&gt; not keen on the bloodstained tunic because again, same graphic as banded<br/>
&gt; with a reddish tint and less AC with magic bonuses that I am not all that<br/>
&gt; interested in as a bard - really want some kind of breastplate for a more<br/>
&gt; refined and respectable look.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I wear small bronze because I can afford the weight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Banded Bracers - Nice AC to weight ratio, not sure what would be better<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; me at this time<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	An option is to find a tank friend and go to the Ocean of Tears to<br/>
get a Bracer of Erollisi.  A 28 monk helped me and we easily defeated the 2<br/>
NPCs you have to fight to get the bracer.  I heard you have to kill the DE<br/>
first before the pirate captain.  You then have to loot the DE first before<br/>
looting the pirate captain in order for their to be a chance to loot the<br/>
bracer.  Don&#39;t know if this is true or a rumor.  The bracer gives +5 STR.<br/>
Not certain what the AC is though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Blackened Leggings - purely vanity, love the look of the black banded<br/>
&gt; pants<br/>
&gt; on my half-elf, even though they are heavier and 1 AC less than Banded,<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; thing I would trade them in on now would be Barbed Legplates if I could<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; them because they are lighter, same AC as banded, and have AGI bonuses<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I wear bronze because I can afford the weight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Banded boots -  just waiting for a chance to get some Dwarven work boots<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Same here<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have 2 Opalline earrings that I am proud to wear because I killed the<br/>
&gt; mob<br/>
&gt; and looted them myself, a +5AGI ring and a +2INT ring (with base INT it<br/>
&gt; takes me forever to increase my skills)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I have 2 Jagged bands which really help me out with the heavier<br/>
armor.  They also increase AC.  I would place these high on your priority<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
	I got the 2 Jagged bands, DE hide gloves, and a trollhide belt for<br/>
completing the Glowing Stein quest twice.  The first stein I traded for the<br/>
2 Jagged Bands.  The second time I traded the four ingredients for the DE<br/>
hide gloves and trollhide belt.  If you do this quest look me up and I can<br/>
hook you up with someone who can trade you some good items for them.  If you<br/>
need help with the stein quest, send me a private email.<br/>
