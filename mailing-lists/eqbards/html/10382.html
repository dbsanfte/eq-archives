<div id="ygrps-yiv-937622055"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I had the same problem, but I pegged it on my 290ms ping (up<br/>
&gt; from the usual 130ms) and 10% PL (up from 0%).  After<br/>
&gt; suffering with this atrocious connection for 2 weeks, last<br/>
&gt; night was back to normal and I didn&#39;t notice anything<br/>
&gt; different with song durations.  I did have a problem with my<br/>
&gt; timing - I think I&#39;m sensing about an extra 1/10th second of<br/>
&gt; delay between when I hit a key/click a button and when the<br/>
&gt; action is reflected.  Maybe they added some more client-side<br/>
&gt; processing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I can upgrade to a faster machine...  :)<br/>

<br/>
Actually, I&#39;ve noticed in the last week, that it&#39;s gotten better... although<br/>
the lag problem is getting horrible on The Rathe........ but maybe all that<br/>
upgrading or whatever that Cerfnet has been doing will help??? *crosses her<br/>
little musical fingers*<br/>
