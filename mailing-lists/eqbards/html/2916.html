<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614000337">Well met young bard! Here is my advice to you, as you start your journey.<br/>
<br/>
First off Rivervale is a great place to base out of, Misty Thicket is a <br/>
great area you can level all the up into the low teens and never leave <br/>
(other then to train).  Since you are there do the Squad Ring quest, I&#39;m <br/>
23rd level and the ring still comes in handy.<br/>
<br/>
On the weapon choice issue I am a fan of fast weapons, IMO the best weapons <br/>
to get are a regular (non-rusty) dagger and a regular short sword.  Both are <br/>
very fast (dagger 20 delay, short sword 24), this allow you to hit alot and <br/>
get more skill checks for weapon skill increases.  Since your server is <br/>
still young Fine Steel weapons are going to be scarce, but if you can get <br/>
one or two of those do so.  Most people will sell em for 2 to 4 plat for the <br/>
dagger and short sword.<br/>
<br/>
Now you are wondering &quot;How am I going to afford this?&quot; well the best way is <br/>
to take up a trade! Tailoring is a great trade on a young server and you <br/>
will find plenty of wolf skins in the Rivervale area.  Other good skills for <br/>
money is Brewing and Pottery. Both need seed money to get to the money <br/>
making points (brewing needs about 5 plat, pottery around 20 plat).<br/>
<br/>
Now for songs, first piece of advice BUY ALL YOUR SONGS! :)  Now that said <br/>
you do not have to buy them in order. Of your first 10 songs there are a few <br/>
you can put off buying till later: Jaxan&#39;s Jig O Vigor(3), Lyssa&#39; Locating <br/>
Lyric(4, unless in a zone where dying while lost is common),  and Elemental <br/>
Rhythms (9, unless fighting casters which is rare at this level).  Also <br/>
besure to train in, buy, and practice your instruments when they become <br/>
available, esp Percussion and String. Percussion (drums) will make Accerando <br/>
fly and String gives a big boast to Hymn of Restoration.<br/>
<br/>
Song Tactics:<br/>
1st level - Always sing Chant of Battle.<br/>
2nd level - Experiment with Chords of Dissonance (CoD), be very careful as <br/>
it is easy to get over your head with this song at second level.  Also <br/>
practice &#39;twisting&#39; this song with Chant of Battle.<br/>
3rd level - Get a little bolder with CoD, most of the critters in the newbie <br/>
area will fall quickly to it allowing you to level fast with lots of little <br/>
kills. Do not be afraid to die as there is no penalty (other then re-meming <br/>
songs).  Besure to attack the strongest opponent first.<br/>
4th level - Continue level 3 tactics.<br/>
5th level - Go after tougher stuff, you can even do two whites at this level <br/>
if you have full patchwork armor (you did take up tailoring, right? &lt;grin&gt;). <br/>
And if the two whites are too tough use your new song Accerando (THE best <br/>
song in the book) to run for the zone.<br/>
6th level - Work Hymn of Restoration into your song twisting, it greatly <br/>
reduces down time.<br/>
7th level - Twist Chant of battle and your new song Jonathan&#39;s Whistling <br/>
Warsong, you get a double str and ac boast plus attack speed boast.<br/>
8th level - Your new song allows you to pull few mobs from a group, lull one <br/>
or more (you have to be quick) and pull a non-lulled mob.  Great for those <br/>
goblin camps in Misty Thicket.<br/>
