 </span></blockquote>I know people are (reasonably) of both extremes on the topic of spoilers.<br/>
Some prefer to discover everything for themselves, others like getting help<br/>
so they can maximize other aspects of the game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest supplying the information but keeping it sufficiently separated<br/>
that people can delve into it as deep as their own preferences allow.<br/>
<br/>
So on a Web page, for example, I wouldn&#39;t make location visible at all at<br/>
the top level but link to it.  Then other than information such as general<br/>
area, I would make details yet another link.<br/>
<br/>
Web pages are such a cool way to provide information at increasing levels<br/>
of detail...<br/>
