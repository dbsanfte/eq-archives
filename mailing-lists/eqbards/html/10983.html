<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122887020">If you are 20 - try Highkeep. Start in the look out room (with a group) then<br/>
main room 22 - 24 then warrior room 24-28 then raider room 26 to 32.  Go<br/>
into the keep and learn your way to the bank in the basement and to the<br/>
goblin rooms below the basement.  Learn that way well because you will need<br/>
to run for the zone in career there. You can bind in the bank (actually any<br/>
where in the zone but the bank is convenient.<br/>
<br/>
But spots for 20&#39;s also include SK Aviaks, Lake Rathe Aviak Guards<br/>
<br/>
And if you are willing to risk it Unrest and Mistmoore - major trains of<br/>
high(er) level mobs.<br/>
