<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130360735">So last night, my druid friend and I re-enter Mistmoore and find a group<br/>
with a couple of friends.  They are a bit higher level but its working ok.<br/>
Then Macgrough asks if he can join and oh wow, what a great couple of hours!<br/>
The experience flew!  Macgrough played just instruments, I fought, we also<br/>
had a warrior, wizzie and 2 druids.  We had non-stop fighting and great fun!<br/>
All I have to say is playing with another bard is awesome - and I even<br/>
leveled!  (Not to mention it was great to meet Mac after talking to him<br/>
here).  And he gave me good bard lessons and wow!  He even put up with me<br/>
and my online sweetie being schmoopy!  Ok, well obviously I had a good time,<br/>
just wanted to say wow! and thanks to Mac!  <br/>
