<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889066653"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; First time I saw Equestrielle was in beta4, it was a black horse with red <br/>
&gt; eyes and no horn, looked kind of like a nightmare(sp?) from AD&D, but it <br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t aggressive. Crookstinger is probly about as new as Equestrielle.<br/>
&gt; Not <br/>
&gt; sure about the named faerie.<br/>

white.  If anyone wants to check her out, I think she spawns in the NW<br/>
corner of Lesser Faydark and then generally moves in a SE direction (at<br/>
least thats what she did last night on several occasions).  We were on the<br/>
ridge directly south of the northern bandit camp and she walked right by us.<br/>
Very majestic looking and a pleasant surprise.<br/>
