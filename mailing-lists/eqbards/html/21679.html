<br/>
I&#39;ve camped in the MM jail on numerous occasions but always before I got the<br/>
chant songs.  Also was always in a group so we just pulled them out of the<br/>
cells.  I assume what you were doing was opening the doors, targetting one<br/>
of the mobs, closing the doors, and then chanting until the mob died.<br/>
Curious what happens when the first chant hits.  If it is a caster mob, does<br/>
it cast through the door?  Melee mobs?  What about the mobs in the other<br/>
cells that you didn&#39;t target?<br/>

Maybe they&#39;ve been nerfed since. I did indeed sit and chant everything in <br/>
the cells to death, repeatedly and they never moved. *shrug*.<br/>
<br/>
I did this about 3 weeks ago and all 3 of them were chained. The two on the <br/>
left could move to the door, but couldn&#39;t strike very far beyond it.<br/>
<br/>
I admit, I was surprised it wasn&#39;t always camped 24/7 as they were indeed <br/>
sitting ducks, except that casters were extremely dangerous. Also, the <br/>
wandering placeholder did make it a bit tougher.<br/>

&gt;Stuff in the cells are chained?  They sure didn&#39;t have any trouble chasing<br/>
&gt;me halfway to the zone before I outran them.  I hope you were kidding.<br/>
