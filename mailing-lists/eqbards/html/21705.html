Will be interesting indeed though perhaps painful as well.  It is just<br/>
incidents such as this which have in the past touched off hacker attacks on<br/>

Packet Loss issues Thu Oct 5 14:19:00 PDT 2000<br/>
<br/>
Some players may be experiencing packet loss or disconnections from some<br/>
servers at this time. We are looking into the issue currently and hope to<br/>
have it resolved shortly.<br/>
