<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230294079">I&#39;m not encouraging anyone to train SGs or other high lvl mobs on ppl<br/>
(even if they are jerks), but Verant will not ban you. They may claim<br/>
to, just to scare ppl, but when it comes down to it, money talks -<br/>
bullshit walks.<br/>
Any of you on Tarew Marr may be familiar with a player named<br/>
Neuromancer. Well, he&#39;s very famous for training SGs and such on ppl,<br/>
just for the sake of being an asshole. Several members of my guild have<br/>
encountered him and after he tried training stuff on them, they all<br/>
petitioned. He seems to train stuff on everyone he meets. He attempted<br/>
it once on me while I was hunting orcs in Oasis. I petitioned him as<br/>
well. By this time he must have a good 3 dozen petitions on his name. He<br/>
did receive a so-called warning once, but thats where it ends.<br/>
I&#39;ve lost faith in Verant&#39;s ability to keep the game clean and fun for<br/>
ALL players. They seem to care more about the $10 a month than the<br/>
individuals that actually play the game.<br/>
Friends who have lost all their posessions due to corpse bugs come to<br/>
mind. The GMs basically tell you &quot;sucks to be you&quot; and ignore you.<br/>
Does anyone know of anyone who has actually been banned?<br/>
I know a few ppl on Tarew Marr were banned for exploiting &quot;safe areas&quot;<br/>
in beta, but thats it.<br/>
In my opinion, deliberately ruining other ppls fun is much worse than<br/>
exploiting power-leveling tactics. But oh well, what can ya do?<br/>
