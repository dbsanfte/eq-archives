<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584919490">Well, I posted my rant, and since chances are that I won&#39;t last the night, <br/>
here&#39;s a copy for y&#39;all:<br/>
&lt;----------------&gt;<br/>
<br/>
1) The person depicted in the &quot;rape&quot; story was not  necessarily 14 years <br/>
old.  She was 14 *seasons* old.  Now in a normal world, this could mean <br/>
anything from 3 and a half (4 seasons a year!), to  a whole lot older.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s safe to assume from the generalized descriptions that the <br/>
character is not 3 and a half, but to assume that it&#39;s the story of the <br/>
rape of a minor is reading a whole lot into the story.  Fact is, it tells <br/>
me a whole lot about how the &quot;higher ups&quot; think - as Freud said, sometimes <br/>
the cigar IS just a cigar!  14 seasons could mean 14th level - and judging <br/>
by the effectiveness of the poison she used, I&#39;d have to say she was at <br/>
least that!<br/>
<br/>
2) Double standards, Verant.  Or does GM Zatosia have special permission to <br/>
be particularly gruesome?  Frankly, if I were you, I&#39;d be sending that GM <br/>
in for some counseling, or be worried about another Columbine in your own <br/>
offices.<br/>
<br/>
3) Intellectual property: If you truly want to force the issue, Wizards of <br/>
the Coast would be more than happy to discuss the issue of intellectual <br/>
properties with you.  Names are not the only thing that can be considered <br/>
intellectual property, and frankly, you&#39;ve stolen a LOT from WOTC <br/>
properties.  Also, prosecuting ONE instance, while ignoring or encouraging <br/>
literally thousands of others is discrimination in the most basic <br/>
sense.  You are choosing who to prosecute, and only applying the rules <br/>
where it suits you. This is not fair to anyone concerned.  If you are going <br/>
to ban someone for use of &quot;copyrighted materials&quot;, then you need to jump on <br/>
a lot of cases - not just this one that happens to offend your sensibilities.<br/>
<br/>
4) Derivative work: You are ENTIRELY off-base calling those stories <br/>
&quot;derivative works.&quot;  Who is your lawyer?  Lionel Hutz??? <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;A ┬ôderivative work┬ö┬ùthat is, a work that is based on (or derived from) <br/>
one or more already existing works┬ùis copyrightable if it includes what the <br/>
copyright law calls an ┬ôoriginal work of authorship.┬ö Derivative works, <br/>
also known as ┬ônew versions,┬ö include such works as translations, musical <br/>
arrangements, dramatizations, fictionalizations, art reproductions, and <br/>
condensations. Any work in which the editorial revisions, annotations, <br/>
elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original <br/>
work of authorship is a ┬ôderivative work┬ö or ┬ônew version.┬ö&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thus, these stories, while making references to characters in a copyrighted <br/>
work, are not, in fact, derivative works, unless you count GM Zatosia&#39;s <br/>
heroin-addict nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
In short, this was an unfair ruling, completely discriminatory, and far <br/>
more inflammatory than the stories ever were.<br/>
<br/>
When are you going to learn to live and let live, instead of burning <br/>
everyone woman with a wart and a black cat?<br/>
