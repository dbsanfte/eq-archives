&gt; That&#39;s definitely non-trivial dmg, but as you know the mobs we fight at our<br/>
&gt; level routinely hit even the tanks in excess of 33 dmg.  Hell it&#39;s three to<br/>
&gt; five times that.  So while the healing is nice, it&#39;s obviously not a<br/>
&gt; substite for someone dressed like a grape.  Although it might let ya solo a<br/>
&gt; couple of SKs, that&#39;s true.<br/>

distributing the damage relatively evenly, you&#39;re healing 165<br/>
or 198 points per tick.  Lately, a lot of the fights I&#39;ve been<br/>
in (Sol B and LGuk), the cleric has been superfluous, and<br/>
started nuking for lack of something better to do with all<br/>
that mana.<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure our DoTs are 3 pulses, not 2 like our other<br/>
songs.  So Hymn, Niv&#39;s, CoC, Hymn, Niv&#39;s, CoD, repeat is only<br/>
slightly less efficient.<br/>
