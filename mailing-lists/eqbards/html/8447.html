<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lute of the Gypsy Princess un-nerfed? DOUBLE the effect?! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-525994532"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Well, a guildmate of mine stated today that he is now able <br/>
&gt;to heal 45 points per tick with his Lute of the Gypsy Princess <br/>
&gt;found in Mistmoore. He is a lvl 45 bard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 38 I could heal 15hp per pulse with a normal lute.  <br/>
I know for certain a level 45 bard cannot heal 22hp per pulse<br/>
(which is half the stated 45hp with double effect).  Can a <br/>
level 45ish bard state what healing they can do with a lute<br/>
standing up?  And could one of our level 50s state what the <br/>
max healing per pulse is?<br/>
<br/>
I cannot and will not say anyting about the LotGP until I&#39;ve<br/>
seen it first hand or tried it myself.  But +100% to stringed?<br/>
That means you can double the dmg chords does for starters.<br/>
Nothing in the game thus far is _that_ good, not even that drum<br/>
from Nagafen or the flute from Cazic.<br/>
