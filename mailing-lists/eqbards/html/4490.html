<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048260394"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Combine Longsword:  Damage 6,  28 delay,  hits magical creatures<br/>
&gt; Dragoon Dirk:  Damage 6,  23 delay, +2 dexterity, +3 magic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hands down Dirk is way better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never questioned or debated the fact that a Dirk is better than a combine.<br/>
I said that I didn&#39;t feel that the differences between the two were worth an<br/>
extra 30-45pp. And I still stand by that. Is the Dirk a better weapon?<br/>
Surely. Is it worth 30-45pp MORE than a Combine weapon to me? Definitely<br/>
not.</div>
