<div id="ygrps-yiv-90236376">I had an experience last night similar to the one Roop posted about a week<br/>
or so back.  IIRC, after a battle, Roop was poisoned and knocked unconscious<br/>
while at the same time singing the Hymn.  He kept alternating between<br/>
between unconscious and conscious as the poison and Hymn kept battling it<br/>
out.  For Roop, the Hymn eventually won out.  Here is what happened to me.<br/>
<br/>
My group was fighting orcs in the Oasis near the zone border to North Ro.<br/>
We were generally fighting two at a time but the guy who was pulling<br/>
accidently pulled five at one time.  During the course of the fight, things<br/>
started turning sour so I started singing the Hymm of Restoration.  At that<br/>
point, a couple of orcs began to team up on me.  The group leader yelled for<br/>
everyone to zone.  I was down to one bar of health.  As I was backing up to<br/>
the zone border, I got whacked hard and was knocked unconscious.  A split<br/>
second later, the Hymn pulse kicked in and I regained consciousness.<br/>
Apparently the last hit from the orc just barely knocked me to unconscious,<br/>
and the Hymm pulse raised me to just above 0 health.  I was pressing the<br/>
Down arrow key the whole time so when I regained consciousness, fortunately<br/>
for me, I zoned into North Ro and survived.<br/>
<br/>
After saying thanks to Bristlebain, I wondered if this was a bug (shouldn&#39;t<br/>
continue to get song effects if bard is unconscious) or just another benefit<br/>
to the natural effects of all bard songs, (i.e. they continue to produce<br/>
effects even when the bard is no longer singing them).  Should I /bug this<br/>
or just be thankful that I didn&#39;t die.  <br/>
