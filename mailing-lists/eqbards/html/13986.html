For some Sylly reason, I started a Troll SK and leveled her to like 8.  She<br/>
is rather oddly twinked but has only died 2 times.  She kills stuff that is<br/>
yellow - no problem and things that are just red give her great xp.  So,<br/>
with that success fresh in my mind, I started a bard on the test server<br/>
(totally untwinked besides my knowledge of where stuff is etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Hehe, a rat in North Qeynos killed me.  Two times!  I gave up!  How did I<br/>
ever get 43 levels?  My god!<br/>

&gt; The other day I started up a newbie gnome mage.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So now I&#39;ve gotten 20PP for a 4th level character that took my bard at<br/>
least<br/>
&gt; 15 levels to acquire.  With the HP buffs, I haven&#39;t even died since 1st<br/>
&gt; level. </span></blockquote></div>
