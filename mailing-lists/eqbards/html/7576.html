&gt; &gt; the same race. Bard takes off a runnin&#39;.. Wizard does<br/>
&gt; &gt; his fancy teleport to the Karana&#39;s. Runs rest of way<br/>

&gt; You really have a knack for picking worst case scenarios to<br/>
&gt; try to make your point.  You won&#39;t convince many people<br/>
&gt; arguing like that.  It&#39;s like saying because wizards cannot<br/>
&gt; survive more than a couple hits against a high level mob if<br/>
&gt; root fails while a tank can last a minute, wizards should be<br/>
&gt; allowed to wear plate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is that worst case? It was an example of travelling. People<br/>
on this list are always talking about what great travellers<br/>
we are. What would you consider best case? Something that&#39;s more<br/>
common in day to day adventuring? Ok, I can do that..   =)<br/>
<br/>
Bard & Wizard are fighting in lower Guk. Bard is bound in<br/>
Freeport while Wizard is bound in Innothule right outside<br/>
the Guk zone line. Bard & Wizard die. Bard runs through 5<br/>
zones, and does so naked with no weapon. Wizard pops up in<br/>
Innothule at zone entrance, memorizes spells, casts shield<br/>
on himself, has his main weapons ready (spells) and heads<br/>
down to his corpse and group. Bard is still running (albeit<br/>
faster than the wizard is) and has *maybe* made it to the<br/>
Oasis by now.</div>
