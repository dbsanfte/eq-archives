There&#39;s already WAY too much skill overlap IMHO.  Actually it annoys me that<br/>
ALL the casters get bind, then on top of that it annoys me that casters can<br/>
bind anywhere, where as noncasters can only bind in cities.<br/>
<br/>
The best happy medium I can think of is allow anyone to bind at Inns &<br/>
Taverns, but still only casters can cast bind.  Also, take away the bind<br/>
anywhere ability of the casters (forcing them to bind at the inns as well).<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hate to bring this up again, but we Bards seem more like the semi-caster<br/>
&gt;&gt; shamans and clerics than the Paladins and Shadowknights.  I don&#39;t see why<br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;&gt; shouldn&#39;t have bind as a result, probably only on ourselves though.  It<br/>
&gt;&gt; could replace the leel 14 song nicely, unless they plan on making that<br/>
