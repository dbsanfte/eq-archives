<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963003281">Yeah, I have to agree.  When you steal something, it&#39;s not like the object being stolen has to make a specific choice and /storeremove itself.  My first guild on Innoruuk (The Talquinn) had this problem for a few months.  Every other high level who got to 50 left, generally because we weren&#39;t big enough to do the dragons/planes stuff.  So we ended up merging with two and a half other guilds (Crimson Sigil, Order of the Black Staff, and about half of Legends - sorry, Rosha).  I&#39;d say that, in our ability to get stuff done, we&#39;re in the top four now.  We asked<br/>
someone to remove himself from the guild last night, though, because he was clearly courting the #1 guild.  It is kind of annoying to be a training ground for higher level guilds, particularly when they do not show any courtesy or respect when dealing with you normally.<br/>

&gt; Agreed.  Its the individual choice if they want to switch guilds.  No one forces them to do a /guildremove!  I was one of the orginal members of a guild on Innoruuk called &quot;Higher Arts of Arcane&quot; (sp)   I left that guild in a heart beat when it came time to group and &quot;guild members&quot; come first!  though I played with the party more than 3 weeks straight and got bumped because of guild rules!  Now, instead of bitching about the guild rules, I dropped the guild I was in and joined all my friends guild.  Immediately I got things that I have been struggling to get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My point. YOU ARE DAMN RIGHT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PLAYER STEALING.  It is a choice.  Yes, My x-guildmaster had a problem. It was quickly solved after I took anonymous off and he was nearly 20 lvls below me.<br/>

&gt;  Ahhh we have gotten to another peev of mine...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Guilds stealing players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   This term makes no sense to me.  How do they steal a player?  DO they<br/>
&gt;   sneak into your guildhall in the middle of night, creep into DuckFoo&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   room, hold a nocked Ashenwood bow to his head and tell him to leave?<br/>
