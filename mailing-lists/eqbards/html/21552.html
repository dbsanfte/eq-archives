<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798423039">I am a firm believer in AC for bards.  That being said:<br/>
Back:  Cloak of the Icebear (Ac8, cold +20, something else) Around 150-200p<br/>
Neck: Collar of Undead Protection (ac5, disease/poison +7) 20p  (if you go<br/>
to someone camping the squire in guk, he will porbably give it to you for<br/>
free)<br/>
Face:  Buy 3 potions of invis to undead and head to Lower Guk.  Find out who<br/>
is camping the Ass/Sup, and ask them if you can loot the Guise.  (It is a no<br/>
drop rogue/bard only item, often rots).  If they say yes, get an invis (use<br/>
a potion if you can&#39;t get one at the zone) and walk over there. (its close<br/>
to the zone, if you cant get a good map I could give you directions). Hang<br/>
out in the corner, out of their way.  If the assasin pop, let them loot it<br/>
and tell you if it has a guise.  (Ac4, magic resist and a LOT of cha, casts<br/>
Illusion Dark Elf)<br/>
<br/>
I wear 2 jagged bands and 2 Oppaline Earrings at lvl 45 :-)<br/>
<br/>
Another peice to look for is a Tattered Mantle.  You can buy it for 300p,<br/>
its ac12 and some other stuff.  Very good shoulder peice for a very<br/>
attainable amount of plat.</div>
