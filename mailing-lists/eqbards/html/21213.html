<div id="ygrps-yiv-374431145">How about thinking about more than just celerity vrs. beserkers...<br/>
<br/>
Many times the tanks in my group like the dex and str that come from...<br/>
chant of battle!  That&#39;s right, the lvl 1 song with the tamborine -<br/>
especially with procing weapons -  they start counting how many times the<br/>
weapons go off!  So I usually will do the tried and true, CoB, Celerity, and<br/>
largo&#39;s or Niv&#39;s a tank heavy group.<br/>
<br/>
When the group is a balance of tanks & casters, thats when I use beserkers -<br/>
I am getting the str buff and speed buff for one song - toss in a chant of<br/>
flame or furfils, and a third thing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Bzzzz, wrong answer.  40 or 41 are both crappy songs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 40 is single target dispell which doesn&#39;t work and 41<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Uhh I LOVE Disenchanting Aria!  (40) and it&#39;s AWESOME.  I use it to drop<br/>
&gt; damage shields ALL the time.  Our enchanters never bother memming dispel<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; I have this loaded.  It&#39;s a fantastic song and I find it extremely useful<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; any dungeon with casters that throw damage shields or buffs of any kind on<br/>
&gt; mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a psalm of something I believe (yep, confirmed it<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the song analysis page).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find that the only psalms I use are warmth, cooling and the two with<br/>
&gt; &quot;cure&quot; components.  And those I use VERY rarely.  For the most part the<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; really useful psalms are warmth and cooling (though the anti-poison psalm<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; nice vs Maestro and other Lifetap/Poison mobs).  I have yet to run into a<br/>
&gt; disease based attack that really makes me feel it necessary to load up the<br/>
&gt; other psalm.<br/>
