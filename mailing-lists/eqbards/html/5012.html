<div id="ygrps-yiv-465023912">It doesn&#39;t work anymore.  Now if you give a NO DROP item to a mob, it will <br/>
take it, but it won&#39;t be there after you killed it.  If you want to test it, <br/>
make a new char and you will have 5 NO DROP food and 5 NO DROP water.  Try <br/>
to give them to rats and snakes and see if you can get any back.<br/>
<br/>
Here is another warning about NO DROP item.  If you have a NO DROP item <br/>
inside a backpack when you died, make sure you have space in your inventory <br/>
before you loot the backpack.  A normal backpack will drop to the ground if <br/>
you don&#39;t have enough space, but a backpack with a NO DROP item will <br/>
***DISAPPEAR*** if you try to loot it and you don&#39;t have room.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;The only solution around this, as was suggested by someone else on this<br/>
&gt;list, is to give the item to a mob and then kill the mob to loot the item.<br/>
&gt;You can give NO DROP items to NPC&#39;s because of the need to be able to do so<br/>
&gt;for quests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;LORE items I understand, the NO DROP items have gotten a little carried<br/>
&gt;away. BurnedOut Lightstones for example. Why can&#39;t I give those away to<br/>
&gt;someone? They&#39;re not a quest, they&#39;re not valuable loot, what the hey?<br/>
