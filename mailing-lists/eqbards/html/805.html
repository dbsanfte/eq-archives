<div id="ygrps-yiv-403765859">The best place that I have found for soloing at level 12 is West and North<br/>
Karanas.  Pincer Beetles should be possible for you at level 12.  But, if you<br/>
can team up with one good tank and one cleric, you can easily make North<br/>
Karanas your home for levels 11 through 14.  Excellent for exp, but lousy for<br/>
loot.  BTW, the beetles are much less trouble for the experience than Griffawns<br/>
(baby griffs).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hello I am at lvl 12 Wood elf bard.  it seems that I cannot find a good<br/>
&gt; place for me to solo.  I went to CB but the orc&#39;s hit so hard that it keeps<br/>
&gt; disrupting my song.  I died 5 times in there.  I went to Nro and all the<br/>
&gt; places has been camp out.  I was wondering if anyone know a good place to<br/>
&gt; solo at lvl 12.<br/>
