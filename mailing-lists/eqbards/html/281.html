<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-524238831">I kited with my druid early in beta. I did some fairly extensive<br/>
testing and comparison of how much experience I could get by kiting<br/>
reds and toe to toe killing blues and whites. Sorry I didn&#39;t keep<br/>
the post I made to the beta magic board, but it basically came down<br/>
to being close to a toss up as to which was more efficient. I was kiting<br/>
red dark elf guards in nektulos, and going toe to toe with fire ele&#39;s<br/>
in lavastorm. The big difference I was able to discern was that in<br/>
my particular study I was able to get bronze swords and make alot<br/>
more money killing the dark elf guards.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really kite any more, and I think anyone who would spend much<br/>
time kiting with a bard is a glutton for punishment. I tried it recently<br/>
just to compare to my druid experience and it was agonizingly slow killing<br/>
a young kodiak. Moral: if you want to kite, make a druid, and even then<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily expect a magically fast levelign rate.<br/>
<br/>
Now if bellow still did in the 30&#39;s for damage....hmmm<br/>

&gt; &gt;We debated this in the Soerbaird, and we brought it before a GM. <br/>
&gt; Isara<br/>
&gt; &gt;explained the exact procedure, and a GM (not Guide) declared this <br/>
&gt; completely<br/>
&gt; &gt;legal and by design.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;FYI we timed several instances of killing a red creature this way, <br/>
&gt; and using<br/>
&gt; &gt;the same amount of time just sticking to blue/white we didn&#39;t have <br/>
&gt; to run<br/>
&gt; &gt;from. There was no discernable difference in the amount of time <br/>
&gt; spent. There<br/>
&gt; &gt;is a tedium to doing it each way. It takes a long time to killing a <br/>
&gt; 15-16<br/>
&gt; &gt;level creature 8 hps at a time, but it can also be time-consuming to <br/>
&gt; seek<br/>
&gt; &gt;out blues and whites that someone else isn&#39;t already getting. Each <br/>
&gt; tactic<br/>
&gt; &gt;has it&#39;s moment and place. <br/>

&gt; Funny you should bring this up.  I have a level 17 druid, and a level <br/>
&gt; 12 bard.  While I&#39;m well aware both can kite effectively, (the druid <br/>
&gt; more so), I have not ever done it.  This has, of course, slowed down <br/>
&gt; both char&#39;s progress considerably.  Verant may not consider it <br/>
&gt; exploitation, and thus, &quot;legal&quot;, but I do not feel it is in the <br/>
&gt; spirit of the game.  I don&#39;t and won&#39;t condemn anyone else for <br/>
&gt; kiting, however.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Reading someone else&#39;s post about killing beetles in North Karana <br/>
&gt; got me<br/>
&gt; &gt;thinking about an old debate I have often had with myself and <br/>
&gt; others, namely<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Is kiting bad?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I still refuse to kite.  I don&#39;t let the druid in my party (druids <br/>
&gt; kite<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; than anyone) kite.  I still think it&#39;s lame when I see someone <br/>
&gt; kiting, but I<br/>
&gt; understand why they do it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The question is, am I alone in my beliefs here?  How do other bards <br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; feel about this?<br/>
