The way I understand it for bards:<br/>
<br/>
STR: Amount of damage done when hitting in Melee and amount of weight you<br/>
can carry<br/>
AGI: Chance to use DODGE skill<br/>
DEX: Chance to avoid missed notes (subject of much debate)<br/>
CHA: Chance to successfully affect MOB with *certain* songs and better<br/>
selling prices<br/>
<br/>
Now, many people have argued that they do not see these benefits increase in<br/>
any way in correspondence with what DEX is thought to affect, but there are<br/>
several theories as to why this might be.<br/>
<br/>
Another consideration is that I think there are certain benchmarks at which<br/>
the abilities will actually affect or change the figures they are supposed<br/>
to affect.  For example, with STR it is obvious that each point of STR<br/>
allows you to carry 1 more point of weight on your person, however the<br/>
damage bonuses that STR give are not as obvious and may only jump in 5 or 10<br/>
point increments.  Another example, I hear that having a CHA above 120 does<br/>
not seem to affect NPC selling prices any further, i.e., CHA of 150 gives<br/>
you the same selling price as CHA 120 - although I have no hard data to back<br/>
this up.  If you play around with stat increasing items and look at how they<br/>
affect your attack numbers and AC numbers you will also notice that there is<br/>
another mysterious formula working there and that changes are not applied in<br/>
a directly 1 to 1 ratio.  You may also notice that some of those stats go up<br/>
when you level as well.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t do all the number crunching but tend to trust those of us<br/>
on this list that do, especially those of us who are of a higher level than<br/>
myself - however, with a CHA of 95 one night, I got a enchanter to boost me<br/>
up above 100 and did notice that my songs such as root and binding were<br/>
resisted less. Maybe a coincidence, but I was sold, I immediately set out to<br/>
bring my CHA up above 100 with items.  In my mind it helps, but I can&#39;t be<br/>
sure - I RP a lot anyway so just having a high CHA fits in with the<br/>
character that I role-play so I like it regardless - Plus I buy stuff for my<br/>
friends now because between my CHA and my carillion I get the best prices.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I missed you last night, we&#39;ll have to try and get together again<br/>
sometime...its been a while...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, call me stupid but I&#39;m still not sure how to interpret <br/>
&gt; this.  The way I<br/>
&gt; read it, your Charisma stat has no impact whatsoever on your <br/>
&gt; chances to<br/>
&gt; resist a spell directed at you.  Makes sense to me.  The <br/>
&gt; second sentence<br/>
&gt; &quot;..interact/affect creatures&quot; seems to indicate that a higher <br/>
&gt; charisma means<br/>
&gt; you have a better chance of affecting mobs with your songs, <br/>
&gt; i.e. less chance<br/>
&gt; for them to resist.  This reopens the issue I raised last <br/>
&gt; week.  Example:<br/>
&gt; Two 20th level bards attempt to use Lullaby song against a <br/>
&gt; 23d level mob.<br/>
&gt; One bard has a charisma of 85.  The other bard has charisma <br/>
&gt; of 100.  Singing<br/>
&gt; and instrument skills both the same.  Based on how I <br/>
&gt; interpret Butler&#39;s<br/>
&gt; comment, the bard with the 100 charisma has a better chance <br/>
&gt; of putting the<br/>
&gt; mob to sleep.  If charisma has no effect on mob resistance, <br/>
&gt; then both bards<br/>
&gt; would have an equal chance of putting the mob to sleep.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would really like to know the correct answer to this issue. <br/>
&gt;  I wear items<br/>
&gt; that increase my charisma for the sole purpose of increasing <br/>
&gt; my chances of<br/>
&gt; affecting mobs with my songs.  I have other items I can wear <br/>
&gt; that increase<br/>
&gt; other stats as well as improve my AC.  If charisma doesn&#39;t affect mobs<br/>
&gt; resistance, there is no reason, for me to wear the charisma <br/>
&gt; increasing items<br/>
&gt; unless I am selling stuff to merchants.  I guess wearing the <br/>
&gt; charisma items<br/>
&gt; to reduce my chance of missing notes is a reason to wear them <br/>
&gt; but I could<br/>
&gt; live with missing the notes in exchange for the benefit the <br/>
&gt; other items<br/>
&gt; give.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;     Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma and<br/>
&gt; &gt;     one&#39;s saves. Your charisma is related to how well you<br/>
&gt; &gt;     interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Bard&#39;s singing skill has a check against charisma. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess this explains where the talk about charisma affecting<br/>
&gt; &gt; missed notes started.  And the talk about charisma not<br/>
&gt; &gt; affecting resists is a misinterpretation (your charisma does<br/>
&gt; &gt; not affect *your* resist rate).  The entire post is included<br/>
&gt; &gt; below if you&#39;re interested in the other stuff: </span></blockquote></div>
