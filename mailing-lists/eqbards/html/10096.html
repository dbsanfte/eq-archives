&gt;I have seen these items posted claiming improved song affects?  I had a mino<br/>
&gt;horn back when it was a bag on your hand, I know they fixed the graphic, but<br/>
&gt;did they improve the affect of this instrument?  And what about a small<br/>
&gt;brass trumpet?  How do I get one of those?  I have seen the parts, but<br/>
&gt;unless I missed something, I have not see an assembled small brass trumpet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the info<br/>
