&gt; So if I&#39;m using a Combine LS and one of those FUNKY Dvinn&#39;s daggers, I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; better off sticking the dagger in my secondary? As it stands I&#39;m doing the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; opposite, cuz I figure since I have a veryfast weapon to play with I&#39;d<br/>
best <br/>
&gt; give it all the chances I can to do as much dmg as possible by using it in<br/>
<br/>
&gt; my primary. I might&#39;ve just confused the issue ;) What I&#39;d love is to<br/>
stick <br/>
&gt; another Dvinn&#39;s dagger in my secondary hand... *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
A combine LS is 6/28, or 0.214 damage over time ratio.<br/>
A dragoon dirk is 6/23, 0.261 damage over time ratio.<br/>
<br/>
If your chance to succeed at dual wielding is x%, then your<br/>
total damage over time ratio is<br/>
<br/>
(primary weapon ratio) + (x% * secondary weapon ratio)<br/>
<br/>
Unless x is 100%, you will thus always want the weapon with<br/>
the better ratio in your primary hand.  (When x is 100%, it<br/>
does not matter which is in which hand.)  An exception is when<br/>
fighting spellcasters, when you might want the faster speed to<br/>
interrupt them.  But since the dirk has the better ratio AND<br/>
is faster, it&#39;s a no-brainer - put it in your primary hand.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But do folks agree that it&#39;d technically (using Vulcan logic here) be best<br/>
<br/>
&gt; simply to do Anthem with 2 bellows, repeat? This is for me at lvl 20 btw. <br/>
&gt; Wouldn&#39;t even heal, leave that for after the battle. The aim is to zap the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; critter as fast as possible from what I&#39;ve seen. And remember - this is <br/>
&gt; hypothetical. Why I&#39;ll never deny that sometimes there&#39;s a need and a <br/>
&gt; desire to be all efficient about this game, most of the time I&#39;d rather <br/>
&gt; have fun even if it involves more risk.<br/>
<br/>
It depends.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Compare the time it takes you to zap the critter as quickly as<br/>
possible, to the time it would take if you put healing in<br/>
there.  If in that time difference, the mob could do more<br/>
damage than you could heal throughout the entire fight, then<br/>
it doesn&#39;t make sense to heal during the fight.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t an easy figure to obtain (since to figure it out<br/>
you have to kill the mob, which means you can&#39;t do it again<br/>
the other way).  So you&#39;ll just have to rely on your judgement<br/>
as to which is better.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also use Guardian or Elemental Rhythms if we&#39;re fighting<br/>
a spellcasting mob.  Has anyone else noticed that Elemental<br/>
Rhythms actually increases your magic resist the same as<br/>
Guardian (at least up to L20)?  The only advantage of Guardian<br/>
is that it gives me 1 extra AC, and that didn&#39;t happen until I<br/>
was L20.  Before then, Elemental was either the same or<br/>
better.<br/>
