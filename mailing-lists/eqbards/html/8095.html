back in May.  Maybe the other classes are easy to learn.  All<br/>
I know is it took me a good 3 weeks to optimize to my<br/>
satisfaction my solo play with my enchanter using an<br/>
animation.  I&#39;m almost to my 3rd month now, and I&#39;m still<br/>
learning new points and strategies in group play every day.  <br/>
On top of this, I get a set of new spells every 4 levels which<br/>
sends me back almost to square one appraising which work<br/>
better, work worse, or don&#39;t work.<br/>
