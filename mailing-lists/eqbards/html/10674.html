<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535409221">IMHO, the bard class is just fine.  I&#39;m now level 28 and have found<br/>
absolutely nothing to complain about.  I seem to work great in a party and<br/>
great without one.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, this past holiday weekend, I finally dinged 27 and obtained my fire<br/>
walker boots and my fiery vambraces after hours of camping the king room.  I<br/>
then set off to get my runes of one eye (top and middle).  I set off for<br/>
North Karana and wondered found Froon and Choon hanging out on their hill,<br/>
both conning red to me at 27.  After about 15 minutes of ooc&#39;s, I gave up<br/>
trying to find someone to help me and decided to hunt them another day.<br/>
Just because I could, I ran through Froon&#39;s legs on the way to zone which<br/>
agro&#39;ed him of course.  Since I was safe as ever with Selo and my drum, I<br/>
decided to give a charm a try, and to my surprise it stuck!  I then ran back<br/>
and charmed Choon and proceeded to watch the two of them duke it out,<br/>
keeping Selo up the whole time in case charm didn&#39;t stick (I had about 80%<br/>
success rate charming Choon).  Finally Froon went down and I sat Choon down<br/>
and looted.  I then proceeded to Bellow and Chain Choon until he too was<br/>
dead.  Both runes were now mine!  Now I have only the breastplate and helmet<br/>
to obtain.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what other class could have achieved this feet so easily?  I&#39;m now<br/>
28 and I seem to have 2 roles in parties.  If there is an enchanter, I&#39;m a<br/>
buffer, emergency chainer, and extra damage.  If there isn&#39;t an enchanter, I<br/>
take over the role of crowd control.  I&#39;m always primary healer in between<br/>
battles and when those finger wiggler mobs show up, I give us ultimate magic<br/>
resistance protection (well over 100), and often times, a well timed charm<br/>
or pixie strike has brought victory from the jaws of defeat or a well time<br/>
screech has allowed everyone to zone alive.  In addition, I&#39;m almost always<br/>
primary puller (lament rules!).<br/>
<br/>
At times I wish I could hit as hard as my wife&#39;s warrior, or do crowd<br/>
control as well as my buddy&#39;s enchanter, or snare as well as my brother&#39;s<br/>
druid or friend&#39;s ranger, or buff as well as my friend&#39;s shaman...  but who<br/>
else can do it ALL?<br/>
