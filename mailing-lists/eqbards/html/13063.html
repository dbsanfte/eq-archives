Gypsy Lute Fun<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
				Loot rules should be stated at the beginning<br/>
and when any new person joins.<br/>
				You can make up your mind whether to abide<br/>
it or not - up front.<br/>
<br/>
				This concept of the person who can<br/>
personally best use the item having more<br/>
				&quot;rights&quot; to it or even rights to roll for it<br/>
than other&#39;s prolly developed<br/>
				from regular groups and/or guild groups.  If<br/>
you are consistently grouped<br/>
				with players, it benefits the group (or<br/>
guild) to ensure that everyone is as<br/>
				well equipped as possible.  But in pick-up<br/>
groups, or if you have &quot;guests&quot;<br/>
				(non-guild or non-reg group), then I think<br/>
(imho) that everyone deserves the<br/>
				right to roll for any loot. It is their<br/>
compensation for the risk of being<br/>
				in the group.  Now you can modify that rule<br/>
to everyone can pick any item<br/>
				they want to roll for and once they win a<br/>
roll they are out of the rolling<br/>
				until everyone has an item.  This allows<br/>
some choice and you avoid winning<br/>
				something you don&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
				This business of casters should not get Yk&#39;s<br/>
or melee should not get SMR&#39;s<br/>
				(or even the chance to roll for one) is<br/>
unfair because it deprives them of<br/>
				their fair shot for compensation.  You can&#39;t<br/>
ignore the player based economy<br/>
				(trading of items.)  The really good items<br/>
are simply not sold - trades only<br/>
				(or long, hard camps.)  And it&#39;s foolish to<br/>
think that people should have<br/>
				&quot;only one&quot; char. So people want items they<br/>
cant use in order to trade for<br/>
				things they (or their other characters) can<br/>
use.<br/>
<br/>
				Like I said - determine what the loot rules<br/>
are at the outset and decide<br/>
				whether that suits you or not.<br/>
<br/>
				Sylly<br/>
<br/>
				p.s. Yk = short sword of the Ykesha; SMR =<br/>
Shiney Metalic Robe; FBSS =<br/>
				Flowing Black Silk Sash; TBB = Thick Banded<br/>
Belt - some of the most prized<br/>
				loot items out side of the planes.<br/>
<br/>
				p.s. I stopped by outside Ogg early last<br/>
night and saw 2 casters working the<br/>
				bouncers.  Found out that they could use<br/>
some extra help and joined &#39;em.<br/>
				Surprizingly, they were doing alpha loot<br/>
order (normally, someone master<br/>
				loots and sells and splits.)  Well, after a<br/>
few kills we had totally lost<br/>
				track of the loot order and were forgetting<br/>
to loot.  Hehe, when you got xp<br/>
				on the brain and more cash in the bank than<br/>
stuff to buy - minor loots are<br/>
				really - well, minor.  Then the swarm of<br/>
newbies arrived and started<br/>
				vultching the loots not to mention blocking<br/>
our view and whining for us to<br/>
				buff/heal/give them bags.  Hey bud, you just<br/>
ninja looted stuff you can sell<br/>
				for 10-15pp (ok, you are an oger with really<br/>
crappy cha+ so maybe 6-9pp) go<br/>
				buy yourself a damn backpack if you want<br/>
one!  And no bards/enchanters cant<br/>
				sow!<br/>
<br/>
				p.s.s. in order to make some room in my<br/>
bank, I destroyed a no drop wep I<br/>
				looted in Kithikor.  They really missed the<br/>
mark on that zone.  Right idea -<br/>
				poor execution. Danger zone -- where the<br/>
compensation (neither loot nor xp)<br/>
				simply does not match the risk and now it&#39;s<br/>
virtually ignored.<br/>

						Yeah, and what I was saying<br/>
was that in most groups I&#39;ve<br/>
				been<br/>
						in, the decision would&#39;ve<br/>
gone:  Drum.  Bards use drums.<br/>
				One<br/>
