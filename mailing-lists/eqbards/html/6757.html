&gt; Why don&#39;t you buy medium bronze? On my server medium bronze goes for the<br/>
&gt; same price as small bronze.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe he&#39;s on a newer server. Unlike small, medium bronze doesn&#39;t become<br/>
common until you have a large number of players in the 30+ range, and it<br/>
doesn&#39;t become cheap until you have a large number in the 40&#39;s hauling<br/>
it out of SolB.<br/>

At least on our server, most people don&#39;t hunt Permafrost until a good<br/>
amount of the goblins are green to them. Goblins seem to be way tougher<br/>
than their con says they should be, so people treat Perma as an item<br/>
dungeon, not an experience dungeon.<br/>
