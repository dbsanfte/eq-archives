<div id="ygrps-yiv-571162007">Hello all,<br/>
Last night, as I was busy dying in Runnyeye (see<br/>
earlier post &lt;g&gt;), I got a tell from one of my<br/>
guildmates.  It seems he was on his way through the<br/>
commons, and some silly Dragoon decided to try to<br/>
spank him.  Tsk tsk.  The long and short end of it was<br/>
that he had a Dragoon Dirk, and knowing Im the ONLY<br/>
one in the guild aside from the mages who uses<br/>
Peircing weapons (for RP reasons, I refuse to use any<br/>
other type...talk about limiting your options...hehe),<br/>
he wanted to know if I would like it.<br/>
<br/>
Well...I told him &quot;Thanks, but I already have one. <br/>
Sell it, its worth 30ish Plat these days&quot;  He laughed.<br/>
 I often forget how much he makes a night (My Cleric,<br/>
until I retired him, was his constant Band-aid, and<br/>
even now, I have crossed zones to help him heal faster<br/>
with Hymn...with high level Warriors...it can take a<br/>
LONG time..hehe).<br/>
  Then it hit me.  &quot;Please bring it here...I CAN use<br/>
it&quot;.  I went to Rivervale, sprinted up the stairs, and<br/>
handed my Dirk to the Marshall.  He give me 3 gold,<br/>
some pittance of exp and a nice SHINY NEW Leatherfoot<br/>
Raider cap.  At AC4, its less than the AC of my Banded<br/>
helm (I HATE the Wood Elf Bronze one), but that +10<br/>
CHARISMA is NIIIIIICE.  By the time I got downstairs,<br/>
he was waiting with a new Dirk for me.<br/>
  Ok, it was borderline Twinking.  We spent a lot of<br/>
time grouping in the past (with my old character) and<br/>
are friends.  He is one of the main reasons I JOINED<br/>
the guild (though I have found many to remain). <br/>
However, with THIS character, I HAVE spent countless<br/>
minutes playing Hymn for him, just to let him disband<br/>
and continue soloing (when he was in the mood to).  I<br/>
figure I earned that dirk with this character, as<br/>
30plat was NOTHING to him...<br/>
<br/>
That is the story, but I have to say..the Raider Cap<br/>
is a NICE thing for a bard to own.  Maybe someday I&#39;ll<br/>
replace it with something better, but to replace a +10<br/>
charisma bonus...it better have SOMETHING special...<br/>
