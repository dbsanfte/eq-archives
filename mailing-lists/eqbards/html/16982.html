&gt; <br/>
&gt; DDD, for example, calculates to 33 dmg for my level (48 still) and I presume<br/>
&gt; that this means 33 for 3 &#39;ticks&#39; (correct me if that is wrong: DoT lasts 3<br/>
&gt; ticks).  Now is that a potential max damage number in that you can get<br/>
&gt; partial resists?  Or does that mean if the song sticks (not resisted on the<br/>
&gt; first tick) it will do 33 * 3 for a total of 99?  Or is there a possibility<br/>
&gt; of partial resists?<br/>

with it (I haven&#39;t run into him in town while he&#39;s free to<br/>
test this).  But I&#39;m pretty sure it does last 3 ticks (deducts<br/>
hp 3 times if you only pulse the song once).  The listed<br/>
damage is done per tick.  If it&#39;s not resisted, the DoT is on<br/>
for the duration, meaning 3*33 for a total of 99.<br/>
