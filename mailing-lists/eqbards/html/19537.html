 </span></blockquote>Funny you should ask...<br/>
     Last night some guildmates and I decided to camp the giants in FV (it&#39;s<br/>
rarely taken on The Rathe).  After breaking the camp, we settled into a nice<br/>
three hour session of &quot;Pop-n-Pull&quot;, (Me-34th lvl bard, 36 druid, 39 then<br/>
dinged to 40 druid, a 40-ish mage, then later a 32 druid joined us), except<br/>
for one time where our puller pulled one and another spawned right in his<br/>
path.  While the exp was nice, the loot was not worth our time.  All told,<br/>
we came away with 1 Black Pearl, 1 Axe of the Iron Back, a Word, and a sum<br/>
total of 10pp in coins.  Was I expecting Forest Loops in every drop?  No.<br/>
But to personally loot 8-9 giants and have 5 or 6 with *nothing* (no items<br/>
or money) is just wrong.  From even just a coinage standpoint, I would have<br/>
come out muuuuch better by far if I had just gone to SK and camped the<br/>
Hermit :oP  <br/>
Is it my imagination, or did someone at Verant make a comment along the<br/>
lines of loot being comparable to the difficulty of the creature?  FYI:<br/>
those giants are quite tough ;o)~<br/>
<br/>
One more thing:  How much is Singing Steel going for on the other servers?<br/>
Saw a level one bard mule last night auctioning SS Boots.  He told me he can<br/>
get 15k plat for them.  For that much, I&#39;ld rather  just try to organize a<br/>
guild event in Karnor&#39;s and loot them myself :oP<br/>
