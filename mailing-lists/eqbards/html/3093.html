<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396018437">Kill blue mobs - try yeller ones too if you have full health. Don&#39;t buy food<br/>
- attack a yeller mob instead.  Kill gobbies that you see carrying weps.<br/>
weps are good loots to sell. take up tailoring as soon as you can afford to<br/>
buy the small kit (don&#39;t buy the how to sew - ask other players if you don&#39;t<br/>
want a spoiler from web) and make patch work. If you get &quot;chunk of meat&quot; you<br/>
can use as food.  But you should be dieing a lot in order to get your levels<br/>
and have no problem with food.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am missing something?  Maybe your play style is that you don&#39;t want<br/>
to die?  If so, I applaud you but if you want to level faster, you need to<br/>
be taking more and more risks and take advantage of the no xp loss under<br/>
level 6.  Gamey? yes. But you keep asking how to get levels.<br/>

		Oh, the prices I&#39;m getting paid for fire beetle eyes is<br/>
barely over 1<br/>
		silver a piece ... so I know I&#39;m getting gipped.  I know I<br/>
got more for<br/>
		the same thing in Freeport from the bard guild.  Same with<br/>
the snake<br/>
		teeth and skins.  I have barely 5 gold or so (can&#39;t remember<br/>
exactly<br/>
		right now) after an entire level and a half of hunting in<br/>
Rivervale ...<br/>
		and no buying anything.  I&#39;ve either died or foraged food &<br/>
water for<br/>
		myself.  I&#39;m still using all my newbie stuff.<br/>
<br/>
		I&#39;m killing bixies as much as I can ... which isn&#39;t hard ...<br/>
they crawl<br/>
		out of the woodwork to attack me, lol.<br/>

		Just one more piece of advice. From what I remember of being<br/>
level 3,<br/>
		anything you can kill&#39;s loot sucks. I dont think your<br/>
getting gipped as<br/>
		much<br/>
		as the loot just sucks....<br/>
