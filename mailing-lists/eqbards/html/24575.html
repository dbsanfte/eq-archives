didn&#39;t know a kylong bp dropped, never seen one, although it makes <br/>
sense with bracers, arms, and legs dropping. I have the Trak bp so <br/>
it&#39;s doubtful I would be interested in a kylong bp. <br/>
<br/>
I was joking about the Breastplate, hehe, I figured you were there <br/>
for the Mask. :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve seen about 3 of the BP&#39;s while actually looking for Masks (2 in <br/>
1 night :/) and they pretty much suck.  They&#39;re not horrendous, but <br/>
they&#39;re chain based and anyone who can wear it that&#39;s hunting in the <br/>
West Wing of HS more than likely has something better.  Oh, and <br/>
they&#39;re NO DROP, so it can&#39;t even make a nice parting gift to whoever <br/>
doesn&#39;t win anything all night!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on getting your mask the next time around. :)<br/>
<br/>
Gaelthorne, I was thinking the same thing, heh, first time actually <br/>
running in to you face to face.  And yes, the Boss of the West Wing <br/>
drops the Mask of Obtenebration, the Kylong BP, and rumored to be <br/>
some nice weapon, although I&#39;ve never encountered that.  Then again, <br/>
the Procurator is also rumored to spawn, and some nights I&#39;ve had a <br/>
hard time believing that. :)<br/>
