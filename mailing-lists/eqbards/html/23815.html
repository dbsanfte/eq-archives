<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457600381">It depends on the puller.  If the puller was fetching from nearby rooms and<br/>
bringing in wizzie frogs then having ER and using ER and Pixie (to<br/>
interrupt) on the wizzies in any cycles where you didn&#39;t need the pulse to<br/>
do CC was well recieved by ass/sup groups.  Of course, you&#39;d only want that<br/>
on the pulls with wizzie frogs.  If not with everyone else having mana to<br/>
slow/haste etc .. yes .. you&#39;re mix would have been close to what I would<br/>
have picked.  Unless the puller was always bringing singles, then I dropped<br/>
one of the CC songs for a chant.<br/>
<br/>
One time in ass/sup I ended up with all tanks & rogues .. yep was only CC<br/>
and only healer for a time.  And they pulled multiples including wizzie<br/>
frogs.  Oooo my fingers got tired!   Tho the core of the group was very<br/>
comfortable with me doing the CC, and I begged healers in tells until I got<br/>
one to come before my fingers just fell off. ;)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Song Selection Advice for a Level 35 Singer<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I was in the Assassin/Supplier in Lower Guk for the first time.<br/>
Had<br/>
&gt; myself (35 Bard), 44 Paladin, 46 Shaman, 44 Rouge, and 51 Warrior.  I was<br/>
having<br/>
&gt; trouble selecting which songs to use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Shaman was speeding and Primary healer. I was there for Crowd Control<br/>
(I had<br/>
&gt; an easy time with and blues and Zols which are low Red but hard time with<br/>
Wan&#39;s<br/>
&gt; that were Yellow), Manasong, Snaring and ?.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My 3 Song weave was Cantana (34), Snare (23) and Chant of Battle or Damage<br/>
&gt; Shield. After a while the Shaman got enough mana back after buffing to<br/>
&gt; slow/speed etc.  So I switched to Chant of Battle primarily.  During<br/>
downtime I<br/>
&gt; did straight mana and depending on our condition would weave Cantana in as<br/>
well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What other suggestions for Song Selection do you guys/gals have? I also<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; Pixie, Charm, Heal song, Manasong, and Area Fear mem&#39;ed. At level 35 what<br/>
else<br/>
&gt; could I have done? I know I could have used Elemental Rhythms (MR/FR/CR)<br/>
or even<br/>
&gt; Gaurdian Rhythms (MR). Any other suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any suggestions and help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
