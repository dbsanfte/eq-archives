&gt;  Our songs are not permanent effects.  They are not even long lasting.  In<br/>
&gt; general, the effects we create only last for a few seconds after we stop<br/>
&gt; singing or playing our song.  Binding is very different: it is a permanent<br/>

&gt; how loud the other melees would scream?  If all 7 melee types died in Guk and<br/>
&gt; died in Freeport at the same time and started running back, who would arrive<br/>
&gt; first without outside aid?  The bards of course!  We already have the<br/>
&gt; advantage over all other melee classes in this area.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guk, yes (assuming you don&#39;t bind in Grobb :).  Crushbone,<br/>
Mistmoore, Permafrost, and a couple other dungeons, the bard<br/>
is the last to arrive due to the excessive time it takes to<br/>
memorize our songs (unless you&#39;re using all low-level songs).<br/>
<br/>
Getting back to the original question, I think Verant<br/>
classifies bards as a &quot;not-a-&quot; class. When casters were given<br/>
bind, bards were not-a-caster.  When parry and riposte were<br/>
given out, bards were not-a-melee.  When hybrids got minor<br/>
resist bonuses, bards were not-a-hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that we&#39;re not hybrids does have merit.  Clerics get<br/>
to wear plate because of the taunt effect of heals.  You could<br/>
make the same argument for bards.  Aside from plate, the only<br/>
melee things I can think of that bards get over casters are<br/>
dual wield, a slightly higher dodge cap, and weapons skills<br/>
that increase at 5/lvl (which is moot at level 50 where 4/lvl<br/>
reaches the same 200 cap).<br/>
