<b>Subject:</b> Bard only equipment, a rant <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-777022386">Is it just me or are we rapidly becoming the most ignored class in EQ as far<br/>
as Verant is concerned?  Every time I turn around I am getting a new mailing<br/>
from a friend of another class about the cool new quest they have that<br/>
allows them to obtain this or that magic weapon or armor usuable only by<br/>
their class.  Warrior only weapons are everywhere it seems, which actually<br/>
makes some sense, but the number of other class specific weapons I have<br/>
heard of in the last two months in staggering.  I was also told that some<br/>
previously Rogue/Bard weapons are now Rogue only?  Anyone that can confirm<br/>
this?  I suppose I may be getting more info on this than most people as all<br/>
my friends know I am working on a magic weapon collection, but it still<br/>
seems a bit unbalanced that we are rapidly becoming the only melee class<br/>
without magical weapons devoted to our class.  Heck, Druids and Clerics both<br/>
have class specific weapons now, not to mention all the other melee classes.<br/>
Does anyone on this list have any connections to Verant from BETA days?  I&#39;d<br/>
sure like to think we are going to get some attention as they are creating<br/>
new quests and class specific items, but have seen no particular mention of<br/>
our class in anything Verant has posted.  I&#39;m not usually one to fly off the<br/>
handle and love playing a bard even if it becomes the worst class in the<br/>
game.  Still it is irking to have a friend email me with the cool new<br/>
Shadowknight only weapon, or another with his cool new dwarf only armor.<br/>
How about some equal time for us bards? <br/>
