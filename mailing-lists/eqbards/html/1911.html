<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067786413">Yesterday afternoon on the Rathe server, my magician was travelling from BB to Freeport.  There were 5 people in the zone, none of which were bards.  When we entered the OOT, no one was there, and no one heard me when I /say&#39;d.  My roomie told me that she didn&#39;t hear or see me (also on the boat).  Later in the trip, still in the OOT, one person showed up, but still no one saw my /say.  We chatted in /ooc though.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, on the boat, fully fed and watered, my mage completely ran out of stamina on the trip.  Earlier in the day I took my bard over, and when I hit 1/2, I started singing the Jaxan&#39;s to bring it back up (I was alone on the boat), which worked.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;rant&gt;And I&#39;m falling off lifts in GFD as well.  All my crts are.  I&#39;ve taken to seriously buffing myself as cleric before the dangerous trip up a freaking lift, and starting the hymn as my bard, just in case (though remote as hell) those few HPs save my butt.  This was since last week&#39;s patch and before anyone blames it on ISP lag, I personally witnessed (verified by the victims) 3 others fall either to their deaths, or hurt badly &lt;/rant&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t take the boat often, but people have been complaining for a while now.  I&#39;m guessing they have a serious problem or else they would have already fixed this kinda critical problem.<br/>

      The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny players claimed that the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on the boat...  The first time I was in fact playing a song and thought that it might contribute.  The second time - no bards were playing (assuming no one in the hold was) and it crashed anyways.  I think this was true the third dump as well.  <br/>
<br/>
      So I am wondering if people have any experience in this.  My gut is that there is no relation between the two - and this is yet another myth (like all bard songs will require mana!) </span></blockquote></div>
