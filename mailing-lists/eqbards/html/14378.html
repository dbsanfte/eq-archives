  On my lunch break today, I will run from innothule to solb.<br/>
  I will snap pictures of all the paintings on the walls for us<br/>
  to discuss.  If you have not examined the pictures which are<br/>
  pasted across the zone, you are really missing out.<br/>
<br/>
  /ic, mostly.<br/>
<br/>
  I will be entering Nagafen&#39;s Lair, visiting the King room<br/>
  (king, priest, champ) - and nearby areas to record information<br/>
  as to the meaning behind the art.  I&#39;ve brought this up before<br/>
  and I love listening to people&#39;s take on what it really means.<br/>
  I&#39;ve started conversations with group members in the king room<br/>
  which have lasted hours about the meaning behind the pantings.<br/>
<br/>
  After we talk about the various meanings, I would like to submit<br/>
  the pictures and comments onto a website which we can ask Verant<br/>
  to look at and maybe /chuckle at; then give us the &#39;real&#39; intent<br/>
  or meaning behind the scenes.  There is a story afoot, and I&#39;d like<br/>
  to know what that story is.<br/>
<br/>
  It would be in the true spirit of bards to want to pursue such<br/>
  storytelling in the future.<br/>
