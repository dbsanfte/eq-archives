<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622852169">Definitely.  My guild has been so successful in the Lake of Ill Omen zone<br/>
that our entire guild roster from level 17-24 now resides in that zone.  It<br/>
took me about a week to convince one person to try it, but once they<br/>
realized I had made two levels there in a week they knew it must be the land<br/>
of milk and honey.  I just don&#39;t level that fast.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a full group pretty much every single night in that zone.  The<br/>
goblins, sabertooths, and sarnaks make for good xp and good loot.  Plenty of<br/>
lesser icebones and lesser charbones as well.  I was easily able to solo<br/>
there as a bard at 24th level.  Our 22nd level bard found he could solo just<br/>
as well so you should be fine.<br/>

Is there anywhere that a lvl 21 can fight on Kunark without being completely<br/>
slaughtered? :)<br/>
