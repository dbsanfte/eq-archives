<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267905175">Yeah, I&#39;m not sure exactly where I had the problem.  Not in the kings room,<br/>
but somewhere between there and the warlords room, there&#39;s some place that<br/>
will cause the entire upstairs (all the nice high level gob shamans and<br/>
such) to come running down there to teach you a lesson.  Happened at least<br/>
4 times.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think I made it out alive on any such<br/>
occasion.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Careful not to confuse a monster swarm with area effect bugs.  I use DDD<br/>
&gt;&gt;all the time, even in indoor zones.  (Though I have had trouble in<br/>
&gt;&gt;Runnyeye).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some guildmates and I held the King&#39;s room in Runnyeye for a couple of<br/>
&gt;nights, and I used CoD/DDD quite a bit and never had a problem.  Although it<br/>
&gt;may have been that nothing was directly above me (as the dungeon is laid<br/>
&gt;out)<br/>
