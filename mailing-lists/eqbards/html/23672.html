<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053354841">hehe, thats nothing, this morning in karnors we were at moat.  We had a<br/>
chanter, cleric, wizard, paladin and yes... 2 bards.   At least 4 times the<br/>
damn paladin kept telling us to just sing mana during fights.  Me and the<br/>
other bard were practically crying at the ignorance. Other bard was doing<br/>
lev 50 haste, nivs and clarity, and i was before he starting crying, doing<br/>
chant of battle, hymn of restoration and clarity... and yet kept hearing<br/>
play mana play mana.  Maybe if he let the full mana cleric/chanter stun<br/>
instead of him chain stunning we wouldnt of had that issue now would we.<br/>

I was in Chef/Bar/Armorer the other night (Chef, pulling from the others)<br/>
with my recently-standard group<br/>
of Cleric, Paladin, Shaman plus a Mage and another Shaman.  We did great for<br/>
four hours, the Cleric left,<br/>
we got a replacement Cleric who wanted to come down (I would have taken<br/>
anything with that group, but that<br/>
was all that was at the zone).  She got down, saw there was no Enchanter,<br/>
and gated!  We had to get<br/>
somebody else!  I got 3 blue bubbles in five hours.  Her loss.<br/>
