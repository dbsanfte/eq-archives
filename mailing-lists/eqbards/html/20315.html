<br/>
Just a couple of notes on recent loots.  Went to Paw, ostensibly to help my 31 wiz get some exp but ended up going all the way to the back where the &quot;old&quot; commander&#39;s room used to be.  Killed lots of gnolls and ended up with the Kirch de&#39; Pav (sp?) the 1hs&#39;er that procs poison.  Have not even equipped it - prolly hand it off to one of my low level twinks or a needy young bard (are there any of those left these days?)<br/>
<br/>
Also, spent more hours than I wanted to camping for the Royal Crown of Dalnir ancient coin.  Got it finally and finished that quest.  Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine.  Did not bother to equip that one either.  Sigh.  Getting pretty jaded it seems.<br/>
<br/>
And then for the really good part.  Sunday afternoon, we put together a guild group: me 52 bard, 53 Mage, 51 Necro, 51 Wizard, 52 Cleric & 47 Pally.  Off to Kedge Keep!  I must admit that the other 2 or 3 times that I have been there it was with 2 or more guild-groups with 2 enchanters so I was a bit leery of how bad we might get smooshed.  <br/>
<br/>
We were the only folks in the zone and we just cleared our way in past the green trash and down to the second level.  Phineas was up but I doubted that we had the where-with-all to handle him so we went looking for the other names.  We cleared into Cauldron Boil&#39;s room but he was gone. Then over to Estrella - also not at home. Then we only had an hour left so we went to look for Undertow who was afk.  And finally we ended up killing off all the sea horses and started to work the re-spawn for exp.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Follow me! (famous last words)&quot; I tell my group and we swim out of the sea horse cave and see a re-spawn.  I target it, see that it is a named, and my jaw drops when I see that it&#39;s none other than Coralyn Kelpmaiden and she is wielding the drum!  Errm, the lute!  No, the drum that only looks like a lute!  No, no, the lute that actually is a drum!  It&#39;s all part of &quot;The Vision(tm)&quot; or is it just part of &quot;The Smell(tm)&quot; ???  Anyhow, I screamed: &quot;KILL THIS NOW!!!!&quot; And a few short moments later, looted the Sharkskin Drum.<br/>
<br/>
I got a lot of nice comments from the group on how well the pulls went.  Only a couple times did we have more than a single mob/fish/sea horse to deal with.  Hard to know if it&#39;s because at 52 singles pull or was the lament song really working or what.  Next time, I have enough confidence to try pulling Phinnie&#39;s Guards and then the big fish himself.<br/>
