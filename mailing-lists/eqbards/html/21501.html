<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633690197">I have had various kinds of giants run from me but can&#39;t recall if,<br/>
before the patch, any Hill Giants ever did.  I do know there was some<br/>
sort of change, however, as Crag Spiders (ugh, more silks...) now run<br/>
when at low health where they did not this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I will look at &quot;the wobble&quot; tonight to see if it might actually become<br/>
&quot;the jog&quot; that was intended.  I -really- like the new tambourine<br/>
graphic.  They did a very good job even if I am still strumming it.  My<br/>
only concern is that it will be almost totally covered in a human hand,<br/>
it&#39;s very small on a wood elf as it is.  Anybody seen a human with one<br/>
yet?  I haven&#39;t seen anybody besides myself with one on E&#39;ci but not<br/>
many higher level bards spend time in EK.  *smirk*<br/>

&gt; Also I&#39;ve noticed in Rathe Mtns, that the hill giants now start to<br/>
&gt; run when <br/>
&gt; they are low on health. Makes it a little easier to ensure that we<br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; charming the victor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lastly, has anyone noticed a difference in our running style? It<br/>
&gt; seems to <br/>
&gt; me that it has smoothed out, but since I was bumping up and down in<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; swamp, I couldn&#39;t be certain. Just interested if anyone else noticed<br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; difference. <br/>
