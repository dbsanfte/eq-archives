&gt; The problem is the ones who aren&#39;t being hit will - if they succeed in <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which brings up a couple points:<br/>
<br/>
Unless there&#39;s a healer in the group, it&#39;s usually a bad idea<br/>
to use this song.  No healer, and what&#39;ll end up happening is<br/>
the bard will die while everyone else is at full health.  That<br/>
is bad tactics plain and simple.<br/>
<br/>
The bard should be encased in the best armor the group can<br/>
afford (assuming you group with the same people most of the<br/>
time).  Since you&#39;re going to be absorbing most of the damage,<br/>
it&#39;s more cost-damage-effective for the other group members to<br/>
give their plate to you to wear.  :-)  I suppose it would be<br/>
even more effective with an enchanter&#39;s Rune spell (damage<br/>
absorbing skin) or a druid&#39;s damage shields (short duration,<br/>
but damages the target every time they hit you).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s amazing how many people don&#39;t know this.  Thankfully, it<br/>
seems a greater percentage of folks who&#39;ve made it to level 20<br/>
have figured it out.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends how quickly the mobs tend to wake up from the effect.<br/>
I can twist it easily with greens, somewhat effectively with<br/>
blues.  Whites or yellows I&#39;ll just leave it running.  <br/>
Reds... don&#39;t even bother using it.  It can help (especially<br/>
if it&#39;s a spellcasting red, or a single red mixed with blues),<br/>
but otherwise having all the red mobs attack just you is a<br/>
quick way to get killed.  In addition to a healer, I&#39;d say a<br/>
rogue is very helpful in this regard since a lot of times his<br/>
backstabs can get at least the currently targeted mob&#39;s<br/>
attention off you.<br/>

what this song can do, and yells at you because &quot;you&#39;re not<br/>
playing any songs damn it!&quot;<br/>
