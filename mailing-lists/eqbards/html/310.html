<br/>
This was an excellent list indeed. I&#39;m compiling a smilar list for the<br/>
Soerbaird and love to hear what other bards have done with songs.<br/>
<br/>
One question I pose to all you bards out there: The Charismatic Carillon--<br/>
I know a few of you have posted that you use this song, and that it has at<br/>
least a minimal affect, but I have not even seen that much. My thinking is<br/>
that the song has not yet been giving the blessing of the gods (it is bugged).<br/>
<br/>
Also, could some one advise me of the appropriate way to use this song? Do<br/>
I murmur it to myself, or do I serenade the shopkeeper with whom I wish to<br/>
do business? Do I initiate the trade immediately after I sing, or do I wait<br/>
a moment? How long do I have?<br/>
<br/>
I would advocate that this song is more effective than it currently is, for<br/>
at the moment it seems to be making no difference in my buying. Of course,<br/>
I am a VERY charming fellow already, and maybe I have found a limit to the<br/>
amount dashing good looks can affect purchasing.<br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live!<br/>
<br/>
