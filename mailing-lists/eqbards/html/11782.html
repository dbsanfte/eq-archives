<div id="ygrps-yiv-999591264">That is a very good way of describing personal goals. But there is really<br/>
nothing anyone can do to diminish an achieved personal goal. If you worked<br/>
very hard for an item - it in no way diminishes the enjoyment you had<br/>
obtaining it - or having it, if someone else does as well. That only<br/>
happens if YOU let it happen.<br/>
<br/>
This whole thread started out with competition with OTHERS - and how<br/>
someone else having something would negatively impact an individual. It<br/>
is/was my stance - that the competitive aspects in EQ are much more against<br/>
the world - and as you noted very well - against our own personal goals and<br/>
agenda.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to add to your list on personal accomplishments. The first newbie<br/>
I helped with a particular strategy (in the case of bards - how to<br/>
manipulate more than one song) and seeing that person have a whole new<br/>
world open for them. That was a very gratifying experience for me and *I*<br/>
wasn&#39;t even the one doing the action. Just knowing I helped them become<br/>
more than they were thru knowledge is in itself a reward.<br/>
<br/>
Helping a group do better than *I* know they would have - had I not been<br/>
there - even if *they* are totally clueless.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m a little easier to please than the average gamer. The little<br/>
things and the social aspects are worth far more to me than any mob I may<br/>
or may not eventually kill.<br/>
<br/>
There is never going to be a &#39;world&#39; that will not eventually be known<br/>
fully end to end. There is never going to be a mob that enough people and<br/>
tactics cannot kill. <br/>
<br/>
My interest in these worlds is not so much how my pixels interact with<br/>
other pixels (be it mobs or people) but how I can interact with the minds<br/>
behind the pixels. The human element is everchanging, evergrowing and is<br/>
never truly repetitive.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that&#39;s why I love the bard class so much. We (as a broad class)<br/>
tend to be made up more of folks that value support of others - and<br/>
interacting with them.<br/>

&gt;I win every time I complete a new quest.   I won when I killed<br/>
&gt;Lockjaw by myself, that first solo spectre, the first giant, when we<br/>
&gt;got my ykesha (wahoo!) last night, I&#39;ll win when I see Vox and Nagafen<br/>
&gt;and Innohule... die.  Everquest is a lot like euchre, I win, but I keep<br/>
&gt;playing.  I am victorious when I win the battle, yet I know that<br/>
&gt;the war will never end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; A &#39;game&#39; IS competitive - it&#39;s designed to have a winner - it&#39;s setup that<br/>
&gt;&gt; way. That does not mean you can&#39;t enjoy the play aspect of it as well - but<br/>
&gt;&gt; it&#39;s a forgone conclusion before a &#39;game&#39; starts, someone is gonna win,<br/>
&gt;&gt; someone is gonna lose.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;www.dictionary.com:<br/>
&gt;game (noun)<br/>
&gt;An activity providing entertainment or amusement.  No winner or loser<br/>
&gt;here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;a &quot;competition&quot; is designed to have a winner and loser, not game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Playing Everquest is a game for me.  Lots of games have no winner or<br/>
&gt;loser, this is a game for me, no, there is never credits at the end of it,<br/>
&gt;but that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t ever win. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Show me what in EQ &#39;let&#39;s you win&#39;? Level 50 - nice things?  Ya know,<br/>
&gt;&gt; eventually everyone that is persistent enough at trying will get that same<br/>
&gt;&gt; thing. If you look at others achievements as somehow diminishing your own -<br/>
&gt;&gt; you are superimposing your own personal competition on the world at large. <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s another question.  Would you say that killing Vox would be a good<br/>
&gt;&quot;victory&quot; for my guild?  Would I have a just complaint because Vox<br/>
&gt;is changed 5 days before my guild goes to fight him, and now he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;drop anything?  I had a battle to obtain a manastone from an evil eye.<br/>
&gt;I lost that battle, I was not victorious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The first watershed in a virtual world is the question &quot;Can you win?&quot;. EQ<br/>
&gt;&gt; has a problem here - it WANTS to be a virtual world - but by setting itself<br/>
&gt;&gt; on a level based system it gives the illusion you can WIN.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I won in real life when I graduated from college, yet I am still playing<br/>
&gt;there also.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You think of win as only the final battle, no there is no such win in<br/>
&gt;Everquest, but you can win elsewhere.  I do grudingly admit I compete<br/>
&gt;in Everquest, starting around level 35, I&#39;ve done a /who all wizard 35 50,<br/>
&gt;taken a look at the number of wizards higher than me.  Somehow I gained<br/>
&gt;a lot of enjoyment when last time I checked, I was higher up onthe<br/>
&gt;list.  I&#39;ve made the brews, and the large bowls, and the small<br/>
&gt;banded cloaks, and the fish rolls, and the class 6 arrows, I&#39;m fluent<br/>
&gt;in the different languages, I know my way around 95% of the zones by<br/>
&gt;heart.  I am running out of competitions that I enjoy in Everquest, <br/>
&gt;so instead of quitting, I want the best for my remaining ones.<br/>
