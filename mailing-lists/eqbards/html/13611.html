<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005325628">Yeah they still haven&#39;t learned basic statistics.  Making a spell 10% more<br/>
effective and giving a second save makes no sense.  That&#39;s perhaps the new<br/>
strategy.  Call it an enhancement because you added an MR debuff, when in<br/>
fact its a nerf because the resist chance nearly doubles.  I bet its even<br/>
worse than that with Pixie.  since its a mez song do &#39;higher level&#39; critters<br/>
get a second resist chance vs. both effects?  Yikes that would explain its<br/>
decreased effectiveness.<br/>

Pixie Strike WAS changed.  It used to not have the MR reduction effect.  <br/>
When it was a straight mez/stun song it was much more effective.  The MR <br/>
debuff introduced the dreaded double save.<br/>
