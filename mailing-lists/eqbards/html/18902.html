<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031559047">Here&#39;s mine for comparison.  Up to 859AC, no defense skill raises in level<br/>
54 yet, so consider me level 53 for AC purposes.<br/>

<br/>
please did i even say that?  i just said i did not think getting 900AC as a<br/>
bard was as easy as you claimed it to be.  and i have sacrificed stats quite<br/>
a bit for AC.  i assume you were responding to me, my message is not part of<br/>
this reply and i think egroups was a little screwy yesterday.<br/>

ok i may be off, but with practically the best AC item a bard can wear in<br/>
every slot i have 838 AC, yet everyone else gets this AC with ease.  maybe<br/>
my character is bugged.<br/>
