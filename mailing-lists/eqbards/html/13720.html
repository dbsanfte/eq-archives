&gt; &gt; This is frightening.  Of course Abashi&#39;s suggestion that bards need to know<br/>
&gt; &gt; when to stop singing is even more frightening.  Are they aware how little we<br/>
&gt; &gt; can do if we stop singing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A bit extreme..  I stop singing all the time to get mobs off me, stop<br/>
&gt; attacking too.  That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t start again in 5 seconds, but if<br/>
&gt; removing myself from the situation for that time puts the damage back<br/>
&gt; where it belongs, it&#39;s worth it.  A wizard needs to know when to stop<br/>
&gt; nuking, a ranger needs to know when to stop taunting, a bard needs to<br/>
&gt; know when to stop singing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with Athren.  A player (of any type) who jumps into battle with <br/>
guns a-blazin&#39; and doesn&#39;t know when to back off is one of the more annoying <br/>
player types to have to group with.  This is particularly true in any party with <br/>
a healing shortage.  By judiciously backing out when I start to attract too much <br/>
attention, I&#39;ve cut my personal death rate enormously (5 in six levels, all due <br/>
to other groups&#39; trains), which, IMHO, is a big benefit to any party.  If they <br/>
have to try to continue without me, or wait for me to return, it&#39;s a lot worse <br/>
for them than getting a bit less assistance from me in any one particular fight. <br/>
 (And it&#39;s more fun for me, too.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also learned to make more liberal use of:<br/>
/g RUN<br/>
&lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
&lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
&lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those &quot;glorious&quot; everyone-down-to-one-bubble-surrounded-by-a-pile-of-dead-MOBs <br/>
fights do not make up for the far more frequent 2-people-deads.<br/>
