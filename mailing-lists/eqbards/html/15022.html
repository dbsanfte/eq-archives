<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082045356">I agree with Tom.  Given all of the other threads that have had at least some <br/>
acknowledgement on Verant&#39;s part, this one certainly deserved one.  At the very <br/>
least, an &quot;oh, my, we&#39;ll check that out&quot;.  And while I agree that bumps are <br/>
somewhat cheap, they do indicate a serious interest on the part of the readership. <br/>
<br/>
And how else are you supposed to respond if, in fact, you agree fully with what <br/>
was said, and have not yet seen a response of any sort from Verant?  This <br/>
particular thread had 200 responses as of the last time I checked.  That in and of <br/>
itself should make them pay attention.  Too bad it hasn&#39;t.<br/>

PS - I&#39;m ashamed to admit it, but I never even tried to use Pixie Strike to mez <br/>
extra MOBs until this past weekend.  (I know, whip me with a soggy noodle.)  Now <br/>
that I&#39;ve tried it, I have one comment:  this song stinks, too.  I&#39;m in Lower Guk, <br/>
we&#39;re fighting two froggies, a blue wiz comes through the door.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, <br/>
I&#39;ll mez it&quot;, I say.  Four Pixies later and no mez, I say &quot;Oh, forget it!&quot; and <br/>
proceed to pound him.  I&#39;m just glad nobody died.  How embarrassing is that?  And <br/>
that was not an isolated example.<br/>

&gt; John&#39;s hard work and hard data should have elicited a response sans bumps<br/>
&gt; IMHO.<br/>

&gt; Note: Abashi is perfectly aware of the practice of bumping. He has mentioned<br/>
&gt; it before. He does not put more emphasis on things bumped than other things.<br/>
&gt; Because he knows that is artificial to get it to the top of the list,<br/>
&gt; NOT more discussion/information.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well, John&#39;s post on the EQ boards concerning Lullaby now has 5+ pages of<br/>
&gt; &gt;bumps and has remained at the top of the boards.  Yet there has still been<br/>
&gt; &gt;no response from Abashi or GZ.  It is my hope that they are secretly going<br/>
&gt; &gt;to de-nerf it in tomorrow mornings patch without ever admitting that there<br/>
&gt; &gt;was a problem.  Am I a wild-eyed  optimist?<br/>
