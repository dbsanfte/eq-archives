<div id="ygrps-yiv-630869399">Yes - you got lucky.  I was 32ish and with a young friend bard.  He turned<br/>
to try to stop a train on some guy running for the wood bridge.  What he did<br/>
not know was GrimFeather was the caboose!  I foolishly taunted Grim in an<br/>
unsuccessful attempt to save my friend and tried unsuccessfully to run to<br/>
the bridge.  Not encumbered, with MM drums, with Selo&#39;s going, Grim stunned<br/>
me, I got restarted, re-stunned, rinse, repeat. Loading, Please Wait...<br/>
<br/>
A couple levels later, I was in a Grim hunting group and got elected to be<br/>
the puller.  It was a long pull.  Too long.  I was getting kinda close to<br/>
the bridge and down to under 2 bubs, taking stuns, etc.  Finally, in a<br/>
desparation move, I charmed Grim and thank the Gods - it stuck. Pet guard<br/>
here. Selos and crossed the bridge with under a bub of hp.  I think he broke<br/>
charm and was catching me.  The group killed him np and I missed the xp cuz<br/>
I was zoned out.<br/>

		3)  It sucks when you choose a greenie too small.  You tell<br/>
it to attack and<br/>
		it runs off...  Once one brought back GF.  I don&#39;t have a MM<br/>
yet, but I was<br/>
		able to stay ahead of GF.  I did get to zone safe on that<br/>
one.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
		stories about GF&#39;s speed?  Did I just get lucky?</div>
