<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996914677">This morning, they had this grouped in with &quot;changes&quot; observed in last<br/>
patch.<br/>
after I said something to the point that casters realm was on crack , or<br/>
lived in a cave after I tested it, they took it out of the changes from last<br/>
nights patch, and added a blurb stating that it was from last weeks patch<br/>
