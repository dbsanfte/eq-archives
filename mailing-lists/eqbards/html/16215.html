<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379306504"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; morning, we had a small debate whether it was 32 or 34 minutes and over the<br/>
&gt; next 8 hours or so EVERY single spawn was almost exactly 34 minutes after<br/>
&gt; the &quot;death&quot; of its placeholder/predecessor.  When I camped the Lord, he and<br/>
&gt; his guards also had exactly a 34 minute spawn time from the death of the<br/>
&gt; last one.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s Prexus and we just are super consistant, but for the most part<br/>
&gt; the timings are right on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  As I stated in my reply, it all depends on factors that you have<br/>
  little or no control over.  I know for a fact that I&#39;ve been in<br/>
  the Lord room waiting around for 45 mins on a crowded night in<br/>
  Lguk with 80 people in the zone.  I know this has happened to <br/>
  others just by listening to the ooc/shout &#39;Geez, when is X gonna<br/>
  spawn already, it&#39;s been like 50 mins&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  My mask dropped on the 5th spawn after 4 placeholders.  The assassin<br/>
  took his sweet time too, as we were about to leave since it was <br/>
  clear he wasn&#39;t spawning on time - (had to wait an extra 5 mins from<br/>
  the normal timings I was doing) he decided to show up.<br/>
<br/>
  If everything is running smoothly, then all things should respawn<br/>
  on time.  If they aren&#39;t then you will know right away.  Everytime<br/>
  I see the number 34 posted here, I think about all those people<br/>
  wondering where the hell X spawn is after it&#39;s 34.0 mins are up.<br/>
<br/>
  Plus my guess is this is all running on a non-Unix solution, and<br/>
  I&#39;ve never known NT to be that good at anything ;-)<br/>
