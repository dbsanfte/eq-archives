<div id="ygrps-yiv-884945320"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, there&#39;s a character on my server named Fabian.  Any idea what will<br/>
happen now that the real Fabian will be in the world?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the past, when PCs have had the same name as an NPC, the player was<br/>
&#39;invited&#39; to change their name.  Of course, if the GMs don&#39;t see that guy<br/>
has the same name, he&#39;ll slip through the net.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, the PC Fabian could argue that he&#39;s been around longer than the<br/>
NPC Fabian. ;)</div>
