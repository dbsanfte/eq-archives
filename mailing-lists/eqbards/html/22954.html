<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Why did you start a Bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-734736700">Why did I start a bard?  Well when retail first came out I started<br/>
up a monk on Tarew Marr and played him up about 15 levels. He was really<br/>
cool and all, but nothing special.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I found out my guild from another game had started up on Bertox so I moved<br/>
&gt; there, and rolled up the one character class I had never really had much<br/>
&gt; contact with on Tarew Marr - the bard.  I gotta admit the one single thing<br/>
&gt; about bards at the time that intrigued me was their speed and health<br/>
&gt; regen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back at the beginning of retail there were alot of unknowns..we didnt<br/>
&gt; really have a clue what songs we got above lvl 20.  I had to discover how<br/>
&gt; to use lullaby (and oh my did that song rock the world back then), chains<br/>
&gt; was a godsend when I got it...charm was amazing...all these things I<br/>
&gt; discovered on my own and with the help of this list...but why did I start<br/>
&gt; a bard? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SPEED!  .... do I have it now? Nope...I plod along like a crippled<br/>
&gt; red-headed stepchild and will never take bard speed for granted again.<br/>
