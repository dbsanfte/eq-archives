&gt; convinced their fizz% is flawed.  According to Vernat, once you get a<br/>
&gt; few lvls above a spell it should be 5%.  However, whenever I first gain<br/>
&gt; a lvl, my fizz% goes up on all my spells until I max out my skill for<br/>
&gt; that lvl.  For example, I am lvl 10 casting my lvl 4 heal. (alteration<br/>
&gt; obviously maxed).  Very few fizz, maybe once every 5 fights.  I hit lvl<br/>
&gt; 11, fizz rates goes up dramitcally to around 1 fizz per fight (with the<br/>
&gt; same lvl 4 spell).  As soon as I gain some points in alteration, it goes<br/>
&gt; back down to the low rate again.  Since this hard to test (get only a<br/>
&gt; small sample every time you level), I asked our wizard to watch for it<br/>

drum.  Before you level and when your skill is maxed (and if<br/>
you&#39;re under level 40), stop/start it a couple thousand<br/>
times.  Note your missed note rate.  After you level, repeat<br/>
but don&#39;t equip a drum (that will stop you from getting any<br/>
skill increases).  Compare.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m too high level to test this.  But since you&#39;re notified of<br/>
missed notes immediately, it shouldn&#39;t take too long to get a<br/>
decent sample size.<br/>
