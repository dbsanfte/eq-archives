<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637159842">this happened to me with a regular store-bought backpack, but not my EE bag.<br/>
luckily it only had a serpentine bracer in it and nothing else.  i have<br/>
pretty important stuff in one regular backpack and my EE bag.  i have<br/>
screenshots of everything i own just in case.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I am told they are 300 plat or so on Mithaniel Marr.  I <br/>
&gt; bought/traded for one for<br/>
&gt; less than that last night but he was asking 325 plat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way I hear they have a nasty bug.  Apparently they <br/>
&gt; sometimes disappear along<br/>
&gt; with everything in them.  I plan to be cautious. </span></blockquote></div>
