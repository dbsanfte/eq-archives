<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606457485">I don&#39;t have any specifics, but yes, there is bard only equipment.  There is<br/>
at least one bard only weapon (I&#39;ve been told it has a 1:1 damage to delay<br/>
ratio too).  Additionally, there are many pieces of equipment that are<br/>
usable only by bards and rogues, elf-hide gloves are one, I believe.<br/>

&gt; Hello fellow bards !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been perusing this site for a while amongst others and have<br/>
&gt; noticed no references to specialty items available only to bards, other<br/>
&gt; than their instruments of course.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know if bards get their own special equipment?  If so, I<br/>
&gt; would be interested in hearing about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
