<div id="ygrps-yiv-133394228"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m only teasing you man.  But you do have the level 50 attitude.<br/>
&gt; Us lowbie high 30s and low 40s know a few things too, ya know?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t realize i had any attitude, i always try to help and not come off<br/>
that way.  on the list and in the game as well.  i&#39;ve been told many times i<br/>
am the nicest and usually the only level 50 person that even talks to people<br/>
when they ask questions or such.  the only thing i don&#39;t do is hand out to<br/>
beggars, i am sure i am not alone on that issue.  if i come off like a level<br/>
50, well i am, and its a different perspective that i pass along to<br/>
everyone, but as far as attitude i try not to sound arrogant and if i do i&#39;m<br/>
sorry.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;yes harmonic you are the better bard i submit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never claimed that, however I probably look a lot better ;-)<br/>
&gt; btw, whats your charisma master bard &lt;G&gt;  I have seen lots of<br/>
&gt; good info and advice from you on the list.  I apologize for<br/>
&gt; offending you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i&#39;m sorry for getting mad.  charisma is 94.  i play a battle bard obviously<br/>
and no one has been able to prove (that i know of) that charisma has any<br/>
effect other than on prices.<br/>
<br/>
no you can not possibly look better =P<br/>
