<div id="ygrps-yiv-993140031">This is in complete contradiction to three cases I saw last weekend.  Each<br/>
time all the player had to say is &quot;I found my corpse but couldn&#39;t target it<br/>
to loot it&quot; And the corpses were moved.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am splitting hairs here - because I guess it is a &quot;verifiable bug&quot;<br/>
that they couldn&#39;t loot their corpse.  However - with the Locate Corpse<br/>
Rod - they easily could - so if Verant wanted to play real tough they could<br/>
refuse.<br/>
<br/>
However - it seems that their claims of trying to avoid favoritism is not<br/>
correct - and they are being far from consistent..<br/>

&gt; I had a similar experience when my wife&#39;s character died from a 131hp fall<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Greetings!  GM Cailleach here.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In regard to your wife&#39;s character&#39;s death, please let me explain the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resurrection<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; policies. The reason I&#39;m doing this is so that you will see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; restrictions<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guides are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; under and hopefully, why they are under them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Resurrections are provided only for deaths where it can be verified by<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guide, with the tools available to them, that the death was due<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to a bug.  In<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In order to prevent even the appearance of favoritism, Verant built<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; policies and procedures for guides so that they would have to be able<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; determine by the location of the corpse, the appearance of the corpse,<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; some other completely objective method to confirm the existence of a<br/>
bug<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; causing the death, they have to refuse.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
