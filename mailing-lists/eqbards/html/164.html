<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bard songs fit into two categories,<br/>
&gt; in my opinion, pulse songs and constant songs.  Constant songs <br/>
&gt;have an<br/>
&gt; effect that lasts as long as the icon is on your screen.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I sometimes do is play 2 Constant songs and 1 pulse song.<br/>
So I might start with Jonathan&#39;s then start Chant then start <br/>
Restoration. After 1 get the &quot;your wounds are begining to heal&quot; <br/>
message I start Jonathan&#39;s and then repeat. Sometimes I take a <br/>
rest after each Jonathan&#39;s as it is the &quot;primary&quot; song.<br/>
<br/>
If I get it just right I can keep the 2 Constant songs and get a pulse <br/>
ever so often as well.<br/>
<br/>
The effects of Anthem dont last as long as Jonathan&#39;s, so that <br/>
strategy does not work as well with Anthem.<br/>
<br/>
I think I am better off stacking just Jonathan&#39;s and Anthem at this <br/>
stage. Like you suggested in another post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John I have a question,<br/>
Does the after effects of songs get longer as you go up in levels? <br/>
An after effect is when the song icon is displayed but you are now <br/>
singing a different song.<br/>
