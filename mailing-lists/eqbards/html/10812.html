 </span></blockquote>Yes, your songs will damage the wisps.  It will take you awhile to kill <br/>
them with just the bellow and the low-level AE (and using the AE will <br/>
probably put you in range to get hit), but it can be done.<br/>
<br/>
The gloves are supposed to hit them (if they don&#39;t, send a bug report), <br/>
not sure what happens if you have magical gloves AND a non-magical <br/>
instrument equipped at the same time.  Try it, you&#39;re on the test server, <br/>
after all.  ;)<br/>
