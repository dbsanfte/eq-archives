 </span></blockquote>	I agree, but the line is very fuzzy.  What if a person acts in a<br/>
manner that makes it obvious they want to join, but doesn&#39;t feel like<br/>
saying it outright?<br/>
	I think it&#39;s a little clearer if you look at it from the<br/>
perspective of the individual.  If you&#39;re recruiting a person because the<br/>
guild wants that person (i.e. you need more bards, or any other class),<br/>
that&#39;s stealing.  If you&#39;re recruiting people because their personal<br/>
desires fits your guild&#39;s vision, that&#39;s simply giving the person what<br/>
they want.<br/>
	Honestly, I&#39;d say 90% of the people leaving a non-planes capable<br/>
guild to join a planes capable one is because they want to go do planes,<br/>
and not because the guild &quot;stole&quot; them from their original guild.<br/>
	The biggest flaw of the system is that as people leave their<br/>
original guild for planes capable ones, the original one finds it harder<br/>
and harder to achieve that status themselves.  This creates alot of<br/>
tension and accusations of &quot;stealing&quot; of players.<br/>
