<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557565325">Last night in PoA I had one of my guild members ask me to put on my plane<br/>
armor so they could take a screen shot (my current look is all black plate).<br/>
I sadly informed her my only piece of plane equipment (after nearly 2 months<br/>
at 46+) is my Six Note Blade.  She was apalled :)<br/>

Let me clear something up about the drop rates on Druzzil.  I assure you<br/>
they&#39;re no better than anywhere else - that&#39;s one reason I was so thrilled<br/>
at getting both gauntlets and arms in one trip.  In fact one of the drops<br/>
was from a patroller (pats we call &#39;em), the odds of which are very, very<br/>
close to zero.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made about 14 Hate trips that cleared essentially the whole Plane.  Of<br/>
those 14 trips I have seen exactly FOUR pieces of Imbrued drop.  I was<br/>
fortunate enough in three of the cases to be the recipient of the item.<br/>
Therefore, I now have Breastplate, Arms and Gauntlets.  I got the BP on my<br/>
second trip about six weeks ago and have seen ZERO pieces drop until this<br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
You have to have a wide streak of masochist in you to get a full suit of<br/>
anything but Clerical armor, which everyone seems to agree drops almost<br/>
twice as often as anything else.  But when Planes capable players see my<br/>
armor there is no question in their minds about how difficult it was to get.<br/>
A lot of people complained pretty loudly that the armor resulting from the<br/>
Lambent (and other) armor quests was not NO DROP and just simply too easy to<br/>
get.  We see a lot of level 8 bards running around in full Lambent, don&#39;t<br/>
we?  You sure as hell don&#39;t see Planes newbies running around in full<br/>
outfits of anything.  A Druid in my guild that has been going to Fear *since<br/>
it opened* just got his final piece (breastplate) over the weekend.  He said<br/>
that he was almost in tears over having received it finally.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in their world now.<br/>

[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3 days in Hate this weekend. First night the zone crashed just as we<br/>
&gt; were cleared to the Maestro. Absolutely no bard stuff dropped. I think<br/>
&gt; Warrior legs dropped the first night, then no more all weekend. No Mage<br/>
&gt; stuff dropped, a few shaman pieces. In general, other than cleric stuff,<br/>
&gt; the drop rate is just pitiful and has a few people who&#39;ve been going for<br/>
&gt; several months contemplating quitting as there&#39;s just not much point to<br/>
&gt; playing anymore. Playing for fun isn&#39;t once you&#39;ve done Hate a few<br/>
&gt; times, as IMO, it&#39;s one of the most boring zones they&#39;ve created. The<br/>
&gt; fast spawning roamers keep you camped in the same locations for hours<br/>
&gt; and even if you did move around every place looks pretty well like every<br/>
&gt; other place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To top it off, a 6 note blade dropped and all the bards had one, and<br/>
&gt; Inno dropped a fatty shaman hammer and there were no fatty shaman on the<br/>
&gt; trip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And to add to the buggy RNG theory, I foraged 100 vegetables over the<br/>
&gt; weekend compared to 20-40 of fruit, berries and rabbit meat. What are<br/>
&gt; the odds of that happening? :)<br/>
