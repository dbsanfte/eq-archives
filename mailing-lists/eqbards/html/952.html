<div id="ygrps-yiv-125882701">I am a 37-year old full-time professional musician.  I&#39;m a trombonist<br/>
currently playing a Jump Blues/Swing band out of Chicago called &quot;The<br/>
Vanguard Aces&quot; I&#39;ve also played Jazz, Blues, Salsa-Merengue, Reggae, and<br/>
theatre work.    I used to work full-time as a computer programmer and part<br/>
time as a musician - but year ago - I was able to to switch that (I do<br/>
part-time consulting out of my home).<br/>
<br/>
    I was attracted to the Bard class due to the musical aspect and also I<br/>
do like being a JoaT..<br/>
