<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Another Lullaby question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-610004072">I&#39;ve played a bard since April 99.  When the Lullaby nerf was made, I had used<br/>
the song on enough occasions to get a pretty good idea of how well it worked.<br/>
For anyone, whether they be players or Verant, to think that Lullaby pre-stealth<br/>
nerf was ridiculously powerful is in itself a ridiculous statement.  <br/>
<br/>
At its best, Lullaby was only capable of derailing trains consisting of green<br/>
mobs.  If the bard was trying to Lullaby several yellow or red mobs, then he<br/>
stood a good chance of dying.  Why?  From April 99 until GZ conducted a test on<br/>
Veeshan (late 99), the bard community was under the false impression that the<br/>
effect of Lullaby lasted for three pulses, just like most of our other songs.<br/>
There was no reason for us to think otherwise.  It wasn&#39;t until after the GZ<br/>
Veeshan test that we discovered Lullaby was a one tick song.  If you were going<br/>
to use this song for crowd control, that meant you had to keep singing it<br/>
non-stop.  But for almost a eight months we didn&#39;t know that so instead we were<br/>
weaving it with one or two other songs.  So what ended up happening was that the<br/>
effect wore off after one pulse and the mobs all started beating up on the bard.<br/>
Inevitably with multiple mobs beating up on the bard, the bard would get<br/>
stunned, stop singing, and it was all downhill from there.  So until we were<br/>
told Lullaby was a one pulse song, it was almost impossible for a bard to<br/>
consistently derail a large train because hardly anyone was singing the song<br/>
non-stop.  And since we couldn&#39;t do it consistently, in no way was this song<br/>
overpowered.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we were unaware prior to the GZ Veeshan test that higher level mobs (30+)<br/>
got a secondary resist check against Lullaby.  This secondary resist check,<br/>
which was implemented around Sep/Oct 99 timeframe, was the first major stealth<br/>
nerf of bards.  One day the song is working fine for 30+ bards, then the stealth<br/>
nerf goes in and all of sudden the song is worthless.   To make the matter even<br/>
worse, we were still getting text messages that the mob didn&#39;t resist the song.<br/>
So what ended up happening was 30+ bards, thinking Lullaby would work against<br/>
30+ mobs like it did against 30- mobs, were weaving this song against mobs that<br/>
got an invisible secondary resist rate.  This went on from April 99 to late 99.<br/>
So until we were told that mobs got a secondary resist rate, we used Lullaby<br/>
thinking it would work.  End result is a lot of dead bards.<br/>
<br/>
The bard community voiced their concern to Verant and they finally listened to<br/>
us.  In late 99, GZ conducted a test on Veeshan and concluded the song worked as<br/>
designed.  It was then that we discovered that Lullaby was a one pulse song and<br/>
that mobs got a secondary resist check with a base 35% success rate.  Fine.  He<br/>
also tells us that bard level vs mob level will factor into the resist check as<br/>
well as the bards charisma.  So if you were higher level than the mob with a<br/>
high charisma then the 35% secondary resist chance would get reduced.  Fine.  So<br/>
bards kept using the song thinking that if they were facing blues with a high<br/>
charisma, then the song would have a fairly decent chance at success.  Wrong.<br/>
Dead bards everywhere attest to the fact that the song still wasn&#39;t working<br/>
right.  So we continued to tell Verant the song was broke but it fell on deaf<br/>
ears.  And we couldn&#39;t objectively prove it was broken because we were still<br/>
getting the text message that the song was successfully sticking.  It wasn&#39;t<br/>
until a later patch that the secondary resist message got added into the game.<br/>
Now we knew for certain if the mob resisted the song.  Armed with text log<br/>
parsing files, John Kim and Kitasi were able to run tests that proved<br/>
conclusively that the song was broken.  That was months ago.  And despite<br/>
repeated promises that they will look into it, Verant still hasn&#39;t acknowledged<br/>
that the song is broken.  IMO, that lack of acknowledgement and unwillingness to<br/>
fix the song in and of itself exemplifies  everything that is wrong with Verant.<br/>
<br/>

I do remember comments that it was riduculously powerful back when it did<br/>
work. I remember reading serveral posts about bards stopping mega-trains<br/>
dead and killing off 15-25 mobs one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks after these stories emerged, it was nerfed.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, an enchanter can keep multiple mobs under indeffinetly, but it is a<br/>
situation they have to put effort into to manage. They have to choose an<br/>
order, they have to deal with targeting, they have to be aware of timing,<br/>
etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
Clarity, Aoe Stun, target, mez, target, mez, target, mez, target, mez,<br/>
meditate, target, mez, all in order, etc. etc. Is not the same thing as<br/>
hitting one hotkey.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I considered that argument and promptly rejected it after we ran a<br/>
&gt; simple test.  The enchanter can cast Breeze on themself and keep a group of<br/>
&gt; 4 mobs that are even cons, mezzed forever.  The resist rate isn&#39;t high<br/>
&gt; enough to give them much trouble since it&#39;s below 10% and the mez lasts<br/>
&gt; longer than it takes to med back the mana.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I then tried the same tactic with lullaby.  6 greater heals later I gave up.<br/>
&gt; Lullaby met with about 40% success on the even cons.  That means it reduced<br/>
&gt; damage by 40%.  Largo&#39;s reduces damage by 30%, is seldom resisted, and<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t stop reducing damage when someone smacks the target.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want 90% success.  If it worked 75%of the time on even cons at high<br/>
&gt; charisma Lullaby would be viable.  Not as good as an enchanter by any means<br/>
&gt; since it lasts 6 seconds, it&#39;s all you can do if you keep them mezzed other<br/>
&gt; than swing waking up the one you are hitting.  It doesn&#39;t even begin to make<br/>
&gt; enchanters obsolete.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Its duration of one tick should be more than enough to balance it out.  Add<br/>
&gt; a higher resist rate than enchanters and it would still be ok.  I certainly<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t recall anyone ever claiming it was ridiculously powerful back when it<br/>
&gt; did work 85% of the time.  Nobody claimed that enchanters were made obsolete<br/>
&gt; by this.  This song used to be very useful and got me into quite a few<br/>
&gt; groups from level 15-18.  Since it has been broken I  have used it combat<br/>
&gt; exactly 3 times.  I put it away in disgust all three times.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the reason lullaby will never work to the degree we all want it too<br/>
&gt; is simple - it would devalue the enchanter class to such a huge degree there<br/>
&gt; would hardly be a need for them. It would be so hugely unbalancing that VI<br/>
&gt; will never make it work the way it seems it should.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An AoE mez that doesn&#39;t require mana, doesn&#39;t require targeting, allows you<br/>
&gt; to melee as well and crowd control with no effort, risk or thought other<br/>
&gt; than hitting a single hotkey is just too powerful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s the same reason they nerfed 54 chains.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe what people should do is offer suggestions about how to balance the<br/>
&gt; song in a different way other than having it not work 90% of the time. Like,<br/>
&gt; make it cost mana for each pulse or make it effect the bard as well as the<br/>
&gt; mobs, or make it a single pulse song instead of a constant one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; After looking over the Lullaby data again while posting a huge<br/>
&gt; sledgehammer<br/>
&gt;&gt; of a question hit me over the head.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Why does Lullaby have a secondary resist???<br/>
