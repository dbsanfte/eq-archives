Here are some additional changes which occured in the patch that were not <br/>
announced. I know you all are probably getting<br/>
petitions on alot of these so hopefully this information will allow you to <br/>
inform players that it was a change and not a bug.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any others we may have missed please report them to your server <br/>
GM so that we can verify that they were indeed<br/>
intentional changes and not bugs.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Normal arrows (item 8005)have had their range reduced from 50 to 25. This is <br/>
because fletched arrows are range 50 and a<br/>
flectcher making his own arrows should have better arrows than generic <br/>
storebought ones. No other arrows were affected<br/>
<br/>
-The Box of Abu-Kar has had the it´┐¢s weight reduction greatly reduced. <br/>
(don´┐¢t have exact reduction specs)<br/>
<br/>
-The item Glowing Stein has been changed to Stein of Moggok<br/>
<br/>
-The Lustrous Russet Armor is now warrior only, a previous error had caused <br/>
it to be used by several other classes despite the<br/>
fact it was always intented to be warrior only<br/>
<br/>
-The Fletching kit now has 8 slots. This is to allow more items added into <br/>
the process to make new bows.<br/>
<br/>
-New tailoring items have been added. Tailors can now make the silk series <br/>
of armor. The books on how to manufacture these<br/>
are also in the game, but are spawn drops and not vendor sales.<br/>
<br/>
-Vendors who previously sold just arrow nocks now sell all of the fletching <br/>
materials.<br/>
<br/>
Reported by a Player (Remf the Troll)<br/>
<br/>
-nobles crests from the npc paladins in swamp are nodrop now<br/>
-kolandi fish now nodrop<br/>
-erud tonic now nodrop<br/>
-honeyjum now require high faction to acquire<br/>
-egg shaped pumice now casts dispel magic instead of pillage enchantment<br/>
-monster frenzy AI tweaked<br/>
-crafted armor now sells to vendor for 10x lower prices<br/>
<br/>
&quot;bugs&quot;<br/>
-fishies still swim in the air<br/>
-items dropped on ground become permanent fixtures, at least client side<br/>
-teleporting monsters play leapfrog when the appear, keep jumping on top of <br/>
you<br/>
-new arrow range overrides bow rating (25 arrow + 150 bow = 25 arrow range <br/>
