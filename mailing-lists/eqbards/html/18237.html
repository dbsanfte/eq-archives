<b>Subject:</b> Break Root <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-827108476">Last night I joined up with an Enchanter (lvl 40) and Druid (38) from my<br/>
guild (I&#39;m 40) in Frontier Mountains.  We were pulling stuff near a zone<br/>
boundary (Burning Wood I believe),<br/>
<br/>
    Anyway - the strategy we were using was - the Enchanter would cast<br/>
Immobilize - sick the pets on them And Dot and DD away.  I joined up with<br/>
them and equipped my MM Battle Drum and Chanted and Bellowed away.<br/>
<br/>
    They noticed that after I came - the Mobs Root Broke much more often.<br/>
We experimented with &quot;Just Singing Mana&quot; and then very selectively singing<br/>
the songs - and had trouble coming to conclusion as to what caused it to<br/>
break root.  (I&#39;m using the term root generically - again we were actually<br/>
using the Enchanter Immobilize spell).<br/>
<br/>
    The only theory that we came up with that seemed to make sense was that<br/>
any time a spell hit there was a chance it would break.  Since the bard DOTs<br/>
duration are so much shorter than the Druid&#39;s and Enchanter&#39;s - I would have<br/>
to guess that is why it broke much more often after I arrived.<br/>
<br/>
    Anyone have any insight on this?  If this is true it adds an interesting<br/>
wrinkle to the balance issue (i.e. Verant considering Bards more &quot;powerful&quot;<br/>
in many regards due to we don&#39;t need mana.  A side-effect of &quot;casting&quot; makes<br/>
the short duration of our songs much less &quot;powerful&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
    Also - using this strategy - I wasn&#39;t sure what the best third song was<br/>
to the two chants - settled on the 21 hp&#39;s I get from Bellows - any opinions<br/>
on this as well?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
