<div id="ygrps-yiv-964823124">like everyone said, always good to have everything maxed just in case.  but<br/>
as far as battle bards go, the best weapons at high levels for us are 1h<br/>
slashing.  i don&#39;t think it is too late for you though, but i would put a 1h<br/>
slashing in one hand and within a level you will have it maxed.  best to do<br/>
it in a group, cause you don&#39;t want to use low skill weapons soloing =)  i<br/>
did the opposite of you.  around level 30 or so i heard about the fanged<br/>
skull stiletto (never panned out, only opbtainable from GM dynamic quest<br/>
now).  by then you have plenty of practice points so i put 10 or 20 into<br/>
piercing since it&#39;s hard to get those first few points, then i put a<br/>
piercing wep in secondary slot and had it to 175 within a level.  then<br/>
around level 40 i got my hand on a staff of writhing, did same thing with 1h<br/>
blunt practice points and had it to 200 within a level.  so i started a lot<br/>
later than you on weapons i had no skill in.  there is nothing wrong with<br/>
piercing, and if that&#39;s what you love stick with it.  but keep 1h slashing<br/>
and 1h blunt in mind, and maybe take the time to build them.  but as far as<br/>
the very best (i.e. what you want at level 50) weapons for us are definitely<br/>
going to be 1h slashing. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; My big question.  Am I making a mistake that will bite<br/>
&gt; me at later levels? (Shada....help me out here)  Every<br/>
&gt; weapon I&#39;ve heard about that is decent damage for<br/>
&gt; bards at high levels is 1H Slash.  Did I, for<br/>
&gt; roleplaying purposes, limit my usefulness at later<br/>
&gt; levels? </span></blockquote></div>
