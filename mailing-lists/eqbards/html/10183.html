<div id="ygrps-yiv-466176403">Thanks for the clarity last night Min, and Enyar said thanks<br/>
too ... we were quite excited to be able to go back and get ourselves in<br/>
trouble again that much faster ... hehehee.  I still liked the Barb illusion<br/>
best!<br/>

				i agree kerra ridge has so much potential,<br/>
but its just horrible, that zone<br/>
				is just hilarious, some of my friends wanted<br/>
a paw (damn druids)  and while<br/>
				we were bored waiting for her to spawn, we<br/>
would cause trains, just to<br/>
				myself i looted 31 catpeople, and think<br/>
about this, we&#39;re not aggro to them,<br/>
				but think about a level 18 group trying to<br/>
reach mitty. They&#39;d get their<br/>
				butts kicked so bad.  You pull one cat at<br/>
lower level and the whole place<br/>
				comes.  They need to fix aggro range or<br/>
pathing or linkage or whatever it<br/>
				is, this zone is just horrible right now,<br/>
and yet its a very cool zone<br/>

				P.S. Anyone on Sol Ro willing to trade a<br/>
hero bracer for lambent boots or<br/>
				gloves? i cant use the bracer as im a wood<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hell we all complained that IP was<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; it&#39;s<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; IP<br/>
				&gt; being upgraded as the general trend that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we&#39;re seeing to make existing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; zones<br/>

 </span></blockquote>where level 50s can&#39;t be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; assured<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; Hills<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Skeletal Monks that will make quick<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; work<br/>

				&gt; very difficult time just finding out that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>his spell is *in* High Keep and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; then making his way from Ak&#39;Anon or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Freeport.  My god, now the obvious<br/>

 </span></blockquote>never have ever seen anything more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; aggresive than a Young Kodiak or the odd<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hill Giant.  The sad thing is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; that<br/>
				&gt; the Hill Giants that he&#39;s seen are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*considerably* easier to kill than any<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kithicor.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; leaps and bounds of *existing* zones in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>order to compensate for the high<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; level player base.  This is detrimental to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the true EQ newbies.  If *I*<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; started a Gnome Enchanter right now, I&#39;d<br/>
 </span></blockquote>know that I could invis (lvl 4<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; spell for them) and travel the boat to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Freeport, EC, NRo, Oasis, SRo,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; Innothule, Feerrott, Rathe Mts, SK, NK,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WK, HH, HK if I really wanted to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; avoid Kithicor.  OR get a high level<br/>
 </span></blockquote>escort during the day and save a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; bunch<br/>
				&gt; of time and zoning.  But a real newbie has<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no idea of what awaits him when<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; he zones from the tranquil WC in to Kith.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mayhem, madness and swift death<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; and exp. loss.  What would *you* do if you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had no friends in EQ and got<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; killed with one spell by an Undead Cleric<br/>
 </span></blockquote>somewhere between WC and the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; Rivervale entrance?<br/>
				&gt; <br/>
				&gt; Most people on this list are experienced<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; experienced players.  If we started new<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 				&gt; untwinked, we would be able to avoid these<br/>
