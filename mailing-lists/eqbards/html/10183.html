too ... we were quite excited to be able to go back and get ourselves in<br/>
trouble again that much faster ... hehehee.  I still liked the Barb illusion<br/>

				i agree kerra ridge has so much potential,<br/>
but its just horrible, that zone<br/>
				is just hilarious, some of my friends wanted<br/>
a paw (damn druids)  and while<br/>
				we were bored waiting for her to spawn, we<br/>
would cause trains, just to<br/>
				myself i looted 31 catpeople, and think<br/>
about this, we&#39;re not aggro to them,<br/>
				but think about a level 18 group trying to<br/>
reach mitty. They&#39;d get their<br/>
				butts kicked so bad.  You pull one cat at<br/>
lower level and the whole place<br/>
				comes.  They need to fix aggro range or<br/>
pathing or linkage or whatever it<br/>
				is, this zone is just horrible right now,<br/>
and yet its a very cool zone<br/>

				P.S. Anyone on Sol Ro willing to trade a<br/>
hero bracer for lambent boots or<br/>
				gloves? i cant use the bracer as im a wood<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mayhem, madness and swift death<br/>
