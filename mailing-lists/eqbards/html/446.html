<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143359062">Personally, I prefer calling it &quot;Juggling&quot;, but whatever turns your crank.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I do not know for certain, but based on my own experience and the experience of<br/>
another high level bard friend of mine, it is dexterity, not charisma that<br/>
affects your missed notes.<br/>
<br/>
My friend was a level 30 bard (before he retired recently), and he was so<br/>
convinced as to the importance of dex that he wore items to boost his dexterity<br/>
over 120.  One of these items was the Grotesque Mask, which actually lowers your<br/>
charisma, giving you an indication as to how important he felt Dexterity was.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the level of the song relative to your own level is very important in<br/>
determining how often you miss notes, as well as your skill with the<br/>
instrument.  The first time I tried to play Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord with my<br/>
horn, I missed about 20 notes in a row before I finally got the song going.  Now<br/>
that I am better in Brass and higher in level, I miss much less frequently.<br/>
Also, I missed much less often when I sang instead of using the horn.<br/>
<br/>
Is this answer definative?  No.  But I would be very very surprised if Charisma<br/>
was the determining factor rather than Dexterity.<br/>
<br/>
Strength is still THE most important bard stat though, in my opinion.<br/>
