<b>Subject:</b> RE: Chain vs. snare <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-583089563">the argument is that snare lasts a much longer time than chain and is<br/>
resisted less and broken out of MUCH less.  hey i love chain, but if you<br/>
have a ranger or druid in the party who is ASSIGNED snaring duty, then let<br/>
them do it.  if they successfully snare, it is in fact better than chain,<br/>
and every time we chain it cancels the snare.  if the snarer is blowing it,<br/>
don&#39;t hesitate to say WTF you are supposed to be snaring, i&#39;m gonna chain if<br/>
you don&#39;t snare! =P<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;So, if you have an effective snarer in your group, please do<br/>
&gt; &gt;not use chain, it really pisses us off to see the monster we so <br/>
&gt; &gt;diligently snared go running off. If you have an ineffective snarer, <br/>
&gt; &gt;chide them about it. It&#39;s one of the most useful spells in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Huh?  Chain is snare + it lessens the attackspeed of the mob.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t get it.  What do you think chain does?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will always override every snare/root I see with chains, much<br/>
&gt; more effective for the party.  Slower attacks and the effect of<br/>
&gt; snare.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I chain something, it AINT moving.<br/>
