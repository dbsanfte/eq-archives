 </span></blockquote>I sing my songs like follows:<br/>
<br/>
:sings, Hello darkness my old friend,  (just an example)<br/>
<br/>
Appears as:<br/>
Orchestro sings, Hello darkness my old friend,<br/>
<br/>
I find I have to type about 90% of the songs I sing in.  Sometimes I get<br/>
lucky and there is a short chorus that i can program into 4-5 hot buttons,<br/>
but it is a lot of typing and Praying that the emote (:) doesnt get freaked<br/>
by what Im typing and come back with the instructions.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I would really like to see a /sing mode or a Singing checkbox on<br/>
the speech redirection menu (say/tell/group/guild/sing?). that would<br/>
automatically fill in the Orchestro sings, part so I could just type.</div>
