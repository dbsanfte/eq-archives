<b>Subject:</b> Soft Cap on Resists (was: Patch Message) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003905652">I understand that.  It just seems that when I see people running from <br/>
a dragon, they are in the bardless groups.  Of course I don&#39;t know <br/>
what their resists were at.  But that isn&#39;t important.  What I really <br/>
want to know is how extensively has anyone tested this?  Or is this <br/>
soft cap stuff all just hearsay from a friend of a friend that works <br/>
for Verant?<br/>
<br/>
But you know, I don&#39;t think that this is a real threat anyway since <br/>
we are the ones that will push everyone over 175.<br/>

&gt; the point was not that you would be feared or ae damaged or <br/>
whatever.  the point<br/>
&gt; was that you would get the same effectivity at about 175 as at <br/>
about 245.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the way to test this is to have someone get to about 176 in resists <br/>
and compare<br/>
&gt; effectivity with someone at 245 in resists.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Sorry Sylly, my question was mainly for the group.  I was agreeing <br/>
&gt; &gt;with you.  Every dragon/resist necessary encounter that I&#39;ve been <br/>
to, <br/>
&gt; &gt;I have never been feared, resist gravity fluxed, taken minimal <br/>
&gt; &gt;damage, etc.  I was just wondering why people are talking about <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; &gt;soft resist cap.  This is the first place that I&#39;ve heard of it.  <br/>
And <br/>
&gt; &gt;I was joking about the bard conspiracy.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand your question (soft cap? uber-guild <br/>
conspiracy?) <br/>
&gt; &gt;but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been on raids, very recently, and have seen first hand <br/>
where <br/>
&gt; &gt;the bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resist songs makes a significant difference.  And this is not a <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; &gt;time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; observation.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Has this soft cap on resists been confirmed?  Or are we just <br/>
&gt; &gt;relying <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on this uberguild leader that may have a conspiracy against <br/>
bards? <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not true in my experience.  Bard songs that buff resists do <br/>
still <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; make a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difference.<br/>
