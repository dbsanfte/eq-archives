<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275984660">Last week I said a very tearful good bye to my very first guild family: The<br/>
Spirit of the Moon.  They are one of the best ever guilds in all of Norrath<br/>
and I will always love them.  For a few days, I wandered the realm of<br/>
Norrath alone. Then one night, I received a call from some friend&#39;s both old<br/>
and new.  Come to LavaStorm!   <br/>
<br/>
Gallenite points at Sylly. Yeah, you!  &quot;Will you do us the honor of joining<br/>
our guild?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes! Yes!! Yes!!! I would be deeply honored to do so!!!&quot;  &lt;clicks on join&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So now, Sylly is a very proud member of The Pantheon and re-untied with her<br/>
long time friends: Nadare 50 Enchanter, Xaera 50 Shadow Knight, Moods 50<br/>
Cleric (we were all level 10&#39;s at the same time waaaaaay back when - well<br/>
actually I have grown up with 2 each of their chars because they restarted<br/>
new ones and level quite fast.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, on the first night as an official member of the guild we went to<br/>
visit Nagafen&#39;s Lair.  I followed as they led me in.  Deeper and deeper,<br/>
down tunnels I had been previously warned not to go.  Watching in awe as my<br/>
group and others dispatched many vile creatures.  Sonic bats, not just one<br/>
but many lava duct crawlers, stone spiders I had never even seen.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we gathered and buffed and such.  We readied our selves for the first<br/>
of many fire giants.  The call was given and the group moved forth.  OMG!!!<br/>
I have fallen into the lava!! Oh this is bad!  So, I try not to panic and<br/>
realize that I do have some time so I better try to get somewhere easy to<br/>
recover.  I manage to find a small piece of terrain to cling to and if I<br/>
keep swimming/running forward, it holds me far enough out of the lava to<br/>
stop the damage.  So, I sit out my first fire giant battle clinging<br/>
hopelessly to some ledge, totally lost and scared.  After the fire giants<br/>
fall, they send a brave ranger to swim in the lava and find me!  Follow me!!<br/>
And back in I go and swim to a place where we can get out!  Whew - that was<br/>
close!!!<br/>
<br/>
Then another battle with the fire giants.  And another. And another. And<br/>
another.  They cleared rooms and places I know nothing of.  When they said<br/>
move forward, I did.  Yet more battles as we dispatched the named warlords<br/>
and wizards.  Eventually we were in very deep and looking at the entrance to<br/>
the Lair.   <br/>
<br/>
One the first night, the dragon was not home.  On the second night, we did<br/>
it again - and again he was not home.  On the third night (New Year&#39;s Eve),<br/>
Lord Nagafen graced us with his presence.  My role in the final attack was<br/>
to provide MR buff for a tank group. Elemental & Guardian with the MM Battle<br/>
Drum.  My first fight with a dragon was short but sweet!  All these months<br/>
had finally paid off and to be here with such great comrades was truly an<br/>
honor.  &quot;You have been slain by Lord Nagafen!&quot; If ya gotta go, there&#39;s not<br/>
too many better ways to die.  <br/>
<br/>
From the excellent clerical services on hand, life was restored to my<br/>
forlorn body and we recovered for another attempt.  This time I decided to<br/>
not get quite so close to the dragon quite so soon but was still  mindful to<br/>
keep my tanks within song range so that they would benefit from the magical<br/>
music.  The second attack lasted quite a bit longer for me.  Nagafen&#39;s<br/>
health was dwindling away and I thought for sure I would see a dragon<br/>
fall!!!  But alas, I have been slain once again.  I sit and mem songs in the<br/>
dusty streets of East Freeport.  Wondering, hoping, wishing... Soon,<br/>
&quot;Consent me, Sylly&quot; and I do knowing that a brave monk is about to pull my<br/>
body from literally beneath a dragon.  <br/>
<br/>
And once again they bring me back to life, back in the Lair, I play the mana<br/>
song even before beginning to loot.  The clerics I am regrouped with are<br/>
working very hard resurrecting folks as fast as mana permits. And in time<br/>
everyone is back with a feeling that even though Lord Nagafen bested us -<br/>
there will indeed be another time when we shall prevail!<br/>
