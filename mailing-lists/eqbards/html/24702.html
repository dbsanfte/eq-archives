<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114616354">That is ridiculous. I have no idea what exploit they are referring to. But<br/>
all this does is make it more likely I&#39;m going to get carpal tunnel<br/>
syndrome working aroung this hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
My lawyer will clean up the suit, but it will go something like; &quot;You get<br/>
us addicted and then proceed to add enhancements that are progressively<br/>
debilitating&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know how to hotkey the F8 command?<br/>

 I replied that this will really hurt bards. We will lose the services&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
of our pets for a short amount of time, will have to charm more (more&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
mana) and will take more damage because of pets having to be targeted&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
each attack.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
 I suggested that they consider lengthening the amount of time a&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
successful Charm lasts as a way of compensation.. even 5 seconds would&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
be helpful...&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;/tt&gt;<br/>
