<div id="ygrps-yiv-56857042">I win every time I complete a new quest.   I won when I killed<br/>
Lockjaw by myself, that first solo spectre, the first giant, when we<br/>
got my ykesha (wahoo!) last night, I&#39;ll win when I see Vox and Nagafen<br/>
and Innohule... die.  Everquest is a lot like euchre, I win, but I keep<br/>
playing.  I am victorious when I win the battle, yet I know that<br/>
the war will never end.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; A &#39;game&#39; IS competitive - it&#39;s designed to have a winner - it&#39;s setup that<br/>
&gt; way. That does not mean you can&#39;t enjoy the play aspect of it as well - but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a forgone conclusion before a &#39;game&#39; starts, someone is gonna win,<br/>
&gt; someone is gonna lose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>www.dictionary.com:<br/>
game (noun)<br/>
An activity providing entertainment or amusement.  No winner or loser<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
a &quot;competition&quot; is designed to have a winner and loser, not game.<br/>
<br/>
Playing Everquest is a game for me.  Lots of games have no winner or<br/>
loser, this is a game for me, no, there is never credits at the end of it,<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t ever win. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Show me what in EQ &#39;let&#39;s you win&#39;? Level 50 - nice things?  Ya know,<br/>
&gt; eventually everyone that is persistent enough at trying will get that same<br/>
&gt; thing. If you look at others achievements as somehow diminishing your own -<br/>
&gt; you are superimposing your own personal competition on the world at large. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s another question.  Would you say that killing Vox would be a good<br/>
&quot;victory&quot; for my guild?  Would I have a just complaint because Vox<br/>
is changed 5 days before my guild goes to fight him, and now he doesn&#39;t<br/>
drop anything?  I had a battle to obtain a manastone from an evil eye.<br/>
I lost that battle, I was not victorious.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The first watershed in a virtual world is the question &quot;Can you win?&quot;. EQ<br/>
&gt; has a problem here - it WANTS to be a virtual world - but by setting itself<br/>
&gt; on a level based system it gives the illusion you can WIN.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I won in real life when I graduated from college, yet I am still playing<br/>
there also.<br/>
<br/>
You think of win as only the final battle, no there is no such win in<br/>
Everquest, but you can win elsewhere.  I do grudingly admit I compete<br/>
in Everquest, starting around level 35, I&#39;ve done a /who all wizard 35 50,<br/>
taken a look at the number of wizards higher than me.  Somehow I gained<br/>
a lot of enjoyment when last time I checked, I was higher up onthe<br/>
list.  I&#39;ve made the brews, and the large bowls, and the small<br/>
banded cloaks, and the fish rolls, and the class 6 arrows, I&#39;m fluent<br/>
in the different languages, I know my way around 95% of the zones by<br/>
heart.  I am running out of competitions that I enjoy in Everquest, <br/>
so instead of quitting, I want the best for my remaining ones.</div>
