<div id="ygrps-yiv-734834549">thanks stacy and everyone else have been a huge help so far.  PGT <br/>
sounds like a really cool weapon!  I&#39;ll just have to duck if i see a <br/>
gnoll coming :)<br/>

&gt; I recommend getting a PGT = Polished Granite<br/>
&gt; Tomahawk as well, it procs at level 11 and<br/>
&gt; renders you invulnerable for a short amount of<br/>
&gt; time during a fight. Usually runs about 80pp on<br/>
&gt; my server, but you can probably find a kind soul<br/>
&gt; with a spare one in the bank, if you don&#39;t come<br/>
&gt; off as too much of a beggar!! =p<br/>
&gt; Also, my warrior used this weapon up to level 30<br/>
&gt; pre-Kunark, will take you at least to level 20<br/>
&gt; these days.<br/>
&gt; Also, the PGT drops in Highpass from the gnolls<br/>
&gt; and is lore meaning that you can only have 1 at a<br/>
&gt; time, so you might want to try hanging around up<br/>
&gt; there a bit and you may just get to loot one a<br/>
&gt; group doesn&#39;t have room to keep.<br/>
&gt; Good Luck!<br/>
