<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408275906">Choke is in the line of the spell you get at level 4 --<br/>
Suffocating Sphere. The first spell in this line is at<br/>
lvl 1 -- Shallow Breath<br/>
<br/>
All of the Enchanter DoTs (there is only one line of them, at least<br/>
through lvl 50) are also debuffs.<br/>
<br/>
And so, I was responding to the person who said htey didn&#39;t<br/>
understand why Enchanters ever cast DDs or DoTs. They cast<br/>
the DoT because it is an efficient spell. MOST of the<br/>
time, I won&#39;t cast my DD.  But sometimes even that spell<br/>
can be useful -- to finish off a critter that is taking down<br/>
your tank when you have no healer/healer is OOM or for the<br/>
megataunt potential of it when you can&#39;t manage to get a critter<br/>
onto you any other way when you have a pet.<br/>
<br/>
I would not use the DD on a regular basis at all. The mana cost is too<br/>
high. But the DoT I *do* use on a very regular basis. <br/>
<br/>
If you have a question as to why a group member is spending their <br/>
mana the way they are, ask them. They may not even realize there is<br/>
any other way of playing. (*shudder* though if you find your enchanter <br/>
has not even bought Mesmerize yet, I&#39;d run the other direction<br/>
as fast as you can. I grouped with one of these, earlier)<br/>

&gt;Actually I agree, choke is a great spell and you get it at lvl 4 right? <br/>
&gt;I remember the first four levels after I got that spell were a total<br/>
&gt;joke since it was so powerful.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Choke is as much a debuff as it is a DOT though...  I like the enchanter<br/>
&gt;debuffs...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t tell other players what to do, I just always wonder why people<br/>
&gt;made enchanters and then blow all their mana doing damage. </span></blockquote></div>
