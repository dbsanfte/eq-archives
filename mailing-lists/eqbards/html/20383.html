<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Back to the old CoF debate <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-424846222">Last night, I went on my first ever Nagafen run.  All went smoothly<br/>
(despite the fact that I had an idiot cleric), and Naggy was soon dead,<br/>
dropping a CoF and an orb among other things.  When it came time to<br/>
random the cloak, the rule was this--anyone who was a tank was in, and<br/>
anyone who would not actually use it should remove their name from the<br/>
lotto.  Being a bard, not a true tank, I removed myself from the lotto. <br/>
The other bard on the run, however, did *not* remove herself.  As a<br/>
result, the two people who had brought me put my name back on the list,<br/>
against my wishes.  Random happens and guess what?  The little bard has<br/>
won her first random ever (yeah, you heard right, in 15 months of EQ, I<br/>
have never won a random).  Woo!  Brand new CoF.  <br/>
<br/>
I don it, it is lovely, and then I hand it back.  Of all the people<br/>
there, all the tanks who have been on 9, 10, even more Naggy runs and<br/>
seen nothing even close, it went to a bard, who can barely use the haste<br/>
in comparison with their double-attacking, quisinart selves.  My<br/>
instructions were to re-random it, and not let the other bard in either. <br/>
Perhaps that was harsh, but if it was to go to a bard instead of a real<br/>
tank, it should be the one who won, not the greedy latecomer (she did not<br/>
show up until about time to random the mith greaves...hmm).  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily for me, an orb also dropped, and the other bard already had one<br/>
(as this particular group does bards before casters for orbs), so I got a<br/>
nice toy anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is how many people here agree with what I did, and<br/>
how many think I am just plain nuts (or both)?<br/>
