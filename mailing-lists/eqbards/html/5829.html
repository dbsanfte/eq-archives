Here is a little trick in this same vain that some of the younger<br/>
SongCasters may not know..<br/>
<br/>
When you memorize a song, you have that &#39;You have not recovered&#39; phase<br/>
that you can&#39;t USE the newly memeorized song until it &#39;pops&#39; into view.<br/>
Start and stop any other song to cut that process short, thus making it<br/>
available immediately. Really helps when you are in a crunch and NEED that<br/>
song you just learned!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; On a side note, I noticed something interesting last night.  I died in<br/>
&gt; Unrest, and was revived (LOVE that spell - saved me a ten minute walk<br/>
&gt; back), and was nailed with the typical regeneration effects.  This effect<br/>
&gt; is supposed to prevent you from immediately being buffed and ready to<br/>
&gt; charge - however, Bardic songs seem to be immune to this particular effect.<br/>
&gt;  I was able to sing all of my songs immediately afterwards, and suffered<br/>
&gt; nothing except a massive loss of mana. Not that I use Mana.... ;)<br/>
