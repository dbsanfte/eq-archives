<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796965611">I know I can reconfigure my socials, I do it as needed. But some of them I<br/>
dont want to lose, and I am about out of buttons to reconfigure. There are<br/>
about 12 pet commands, and maybe 6 you would use on a charmed pet.<br/>

&gt; I am also ticked that when Verant patched last week to &#39;fix&#39; the missed<br/>
&gt; notes on higher level songs, I now miss notes on all my songs even Selo<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; Hymn. I never use to miss notes on Chain till this patch, anyone else<br/>
having<br/>
&gt; a problem twisting because of this? It throws my whol rhythm if I miss a<br/>
&gt; note and then have to re-sing the song.<br/>
<br/>
Yup.  Not only that, the frequency with which mobs were<br/>
breaking out of song effects seems to have increased (either<br/>
that or the random number generator is really crappy).  I mean<br/>
at level 29, you&#39;d think a green drybone wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
instantly break out of four Chains in a row.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Another feature I would like to see is a pop-up to one side that has all<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; pet commands. Anytime you have a pet to control either you have this popup<br/>
&gt; or a button like social that lists all the pet commands.<br/>
<br/>
If you right-click on a social button, you can rename and<br/>
reconfigure it.  Create buttons for all your favorite pet<br/>
commands and put them on your hotkeys.<br/>
