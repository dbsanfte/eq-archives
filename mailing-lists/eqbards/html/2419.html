<div id="ygrps-yiv-679439291"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hi, I just hit 20th level on E&#39;ci, and I had heard mention in previous<br/>
&gt;threads that the (2*dmg)+1 damage formulae only applies until level 20.  Is<br/>
&gt;that just for warriors?  Or for all classes?  Or for some subset.  I was<br/>
&gt;just noticing that my max damage hasn&#39;t really changed.  Any bards higher<br/>
&gt;level than I care to comment?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not really AT 20th, but maybe a few levels after i noticed i was doing 17 <br/>
pts with a barbed whip and up to 15 pts with a dirk. Of course this was <br/>
usually on green mobs, very rarely if ever saw it happen with higher than <br/>
even cons. I hope this changes for me =)<br/>
