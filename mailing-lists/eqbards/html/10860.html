&gt; He started a character and was moving up the levels pretty quick, but then<br/>
&gt; at about level 15 he decided that the whole process was taking to long, so<br/>
&gt; he bought an account from E-Bay with a 50th level character and a couple of<br/>
&gt; 20-30 levels characters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At first this really did not bug me too much, and while I tended to look<br/>
&gt; down in general who bought accounts from E-Bay, I cut him some slack. But<br/>
&gt; now it is really starting to cause some bad feelings, mainly because he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; off adventuring in the planes Guk, Sol B, etc. and I am still looking at<br/>
&gt; another 3-4 months at my pace of play to even get into the 40&#39;s where I<br/>
&gt; might be able to try those places.<br/>
<br/>
Why be jealous of this? Look what he missed? Most dungeons you&#39;ve been<br/>
to in the game were (hopefully) challenging when you learned thier<br/>
secrets and how to stay alive in them. All those cool experiences are<br/>
denied him, as everything there is green to him and no challenge unless<br/>
you really screw up bad. (which some newb with an ebay 50 would probably<br/>
do)<br/>
<br/>
On my old server, Tarrew Marr, one fairly well known Paladin sold his<br/>
account at 50, and the new owner is (was anyway) the laughingstock of<br/>
the server, at least in the high level circles. (Auar for any of you<br/>
current TM players) None of the 50&#39;s I used to hang out with, who are<br/>
the people planning the plane breakins and dragon hunts, would invite<br/>
this character on one of them on a bet. Unless your friend is amazingly<br/>
good at picking up on how to play the game it&#39;s highly unlikely he will<br/>
ever get the respect of his peers enough to be invited on expeditions<br/>
that actually challenge a L50 character, so he&#39;ll probably soon tire of<br/>
camping items in lower guk and sol b, the only places that remotely<br/>
offer a challenge to high level players.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It really make me wonder what I am putting all this work into. While for the<br/>
&gt; most part I still have fun, on the nights when I join up with the world&#39;s<br/>
&gt; most inept group or worse can&#39;t find a group I begin to think about hanging<br/>
&gt; the lute up and calling it quits.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Well I hope you find a solid group of friends to play with sometime. As<br/>
far as I&#39;m concerned that&#39;s the hardest part of this game, and the part<br/>
that is the most rewarding. On both servers I&#39;ve played on, I&#39;ve managed<br/>
to find a group of people who play similar hours, advance about the same<br/>
speed and can actually play their characters competently that I like as<br/>
well, so it can be done. If these people aren&#39;t on, I either solo or<br/>
play something else.<br/>
<br/>
A guild can also help with this, as long as the guild has some kind of<br/>
recruiting standard and doesn&#39;t just take anyone who says &quot;Kewl, can I be<br/>
in your guild?&quot;<br/>
