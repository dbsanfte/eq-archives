<div id="ygrps-yiv-410486346">Well the catch is that using a gamepad *might* be considered a violation of<br/>
the TOS -- from all the &quot;official&quot; comments, it seems that VI views gamepads<br/>
as &quot;macroing&quot;.  Taking that into consideration, they also have backed off<br/>
that stance somewhat since using a gamepad to twist songs (and it is NOT<br/>
reliable in a battle due to missed notes, lag etc.) can offer relief to<br/>
someone who is suffering from a physical disability, a repetitive stress<br/>
condition etc..  I think the best guideline to go by is to NEVER leave your<br/>
gamepad alone with a repetive &quot;macro&quot; going when you are not at the<br/>
keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
I personally use a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro, which has software that allows<br/>
you to program in extremely long series of keystrokes (my heal&#92;mana sequence<br/>
lasts 10 minutes and my levitate&#92;selos sequence lasts 20 minutes).  Other<br/>
gamepads allow programming keystrokes and also have an auto-fire button,<br/>
which would be better suited to this application.<br/>
<br/>
The big thing about using a gamepad to twist is you have to stop it from<br/>
twisting to say anything. Also if you are using it for travel, and you miss<br/>
a couple notes in a row trying to play levitation, well lets just say its<br/>
not the fall that kills you - its the sudden stop.<br/>
