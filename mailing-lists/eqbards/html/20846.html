<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860558383"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Heh thanks :)  Its Veeshan (which explains all the Japanese <br/>
&gt; people being<br/>
&gt; there, heh)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the same on Nameless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A lvl one iksar would absorb one attack, heh, my lvl 8 iksar <br/>
&gt; would do the<br/>
&gt; same...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all who have (or will) reply, I am formulated a few <br/>
&gt; plans in my<br/>
&gt; head.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  Get enough people to clear the room (obviously best option)<br/>
&gt; 2.  Get a guide to help (and I always try to be in character <br/>
&gt; or friendly<br/>
&gt; when i talk to them)<br/>
&gt; 3.  Log on, screech and cross my fingers.<br/>
&gt; 3a.  Get a lesser group to help my Cr from hopefully an esier spot.<br/>
&gt; 4.  Go down the shore house and wait for option 1.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually it is an interesting problem, I think a warrior who wore a trench<br/>
between his bind point and the action might be some small help, unless I<br/>
could get a Shaman to level 9 in time to SoW people *laughs*. <br/>
