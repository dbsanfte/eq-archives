<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523278562">This was with my regular guild group - so none of these were a factor.  We<br/>
simply judged it by how quickly the mobs were dying.  This was in the &quot;pit&quot;<br/>
in the Hole - so the mobs were pretty consistent and we waited a good dozen<br/>
mobs before saying &quot;seems that weapons were better&quot;.  Consider also the<br/>
effect on a tank heavy group (SK, Warrior, Ranger, Bard, Chanter, Cleric)<br/>
with me twisting VoV and Wee helping damage output on the other three tanks.<br/>
Since we didn&#39;t have a nuker, the added Resist Debuf from the chants wasn&#39;t<br/>
a factor.<br/>
<br/>
It really does show my own personal belief that there is no true answer to<br/>
&quot;what&#39;s better weaps or insts&quot;.  It all depends on the group you&#39;re in...<br/>

In a group, they like to &quot;see&quot; damage, especially if they have other&#39;s hits<br/>
turned on.  If they don&#39;t see numbers on the screen, they don&#39;t think you<br/>
are doing anything.  Also, seeing you with your drum (stick) and no weapons<br/>
(no exaggereatedly huge sionaches or breathe of harmony), they think you are<br/>
not contributing.  So then you can tell them that your 3 chants do about<br/>
1800 dmg per minute. And ya, 60 levels later, 210 days and still explaining<br/>
to the groups: &quot;... my bard mana song *is* the same as Clarity-2, the &#39;you<br/>
feel smaller&#39; *adds* 35 AC to all of you, etc, etc.&quot;<br/>
