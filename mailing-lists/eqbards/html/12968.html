&gt; I play both a bard - and an enchanter. The two classes are amazingly<br/>
&gt; similar in what they can pull off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They are also the two hardest classes to play WELL.<br/>
<br/>
Also they seem to be the easiest classes to play badly. :)  I was soloing my<br/>
monk in Highpass last night (managed to get a Shralok Pack!) and there was a<br/>
group there, with a bard.  This bard was possibly the worst one I&#39;ve ever<br/>
seen.  She played Bellow during fights.  That was IT most of the time,<br/>
except when she played Lullaby.  When there was only one mob.  I rarely even<br/>
saw Hymn being played between fights.  Her group had mostly meleers as well.<br/>
During the couple hours I was there soloing, I seemed to get an awful lot of<br/>
kills.  I&#39;m almost glad she didn&#39;t know what she was doing, because they<br/>
could have prevented me from getting any, if she was capable. :)  I&#39;m not an<br/>
expert, but it still made me wince.<br/>
