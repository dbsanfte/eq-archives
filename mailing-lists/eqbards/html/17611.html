<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-711017004">it&#39;s the other way around.  Charm is the 39 song and Provocation is the 45<br/>
song.  also, the charm does work on 37+ mobs (i charmed a Seafury Cyclops to<br/>
kill another), and it does not require a flute.  i didn&#39;t know about the 5<br/>
mana someone else mentioned, i didn&#39;t think to look.<br/>
<br/>
the provocation song just pisses me off to no extent.  since when does a<br/>
bard have to target a fellow player to get the effect of their song?  also,<br/>
the player does not have to be grouped with the bard.  AND the song only<br/>
lasts one pulse, you have to refresh it like chain or bellow.  this song is<br/>
so completely un-bardlike.  another wasted slot in our spellbook as far as i<br/>
can tell.<br/>
