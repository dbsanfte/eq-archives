<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538307230">are you sure it&#39;s level-dependent?  maybe in the 30s is when you fought some<br/>
green stuff that ran earlier than we are used to.  i don&#39;t think it has<br/>
anything to do with level.  i think simply anything chained that is running<br/>
away will stop running at 50% health.  they could be running because they<br/>
are very green to you, or you can be forcing them to run with fear.<br/>
anything that runs at all at 50% health or less will stop if chained, i.e.<br/>
even if a white con runs away at 5% health of its own accord (no fear), it<br/>
will stop when chained.  if it just so happens to run at 50% health or is<br/>
feared then, it will stop when chained.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Early on Chain acts pretty much like snare.  But later (level<br/>
&gt; thirty-something?) it will stop runners when they&#39;re at half<br/>
&gt; hp.  That makes it superior to snare for stopping green<br/>
&gt; runners, since greenies tend to run when they drop below half.<br/>
