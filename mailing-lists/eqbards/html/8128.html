<div id="ygrps-yiv-397670295">I just banged this out, its a simple 50x50 chart of songs and if they stack<br/>
(blue block) or not (red block).  I did 1-10 because its late, but any info<br/>
you can pass along would be great.  The URL will give you a zipped excel<br/>
file (its 5 kB in size - I made the not-unreasonable assumption that if<br/>
you&#39;re playing EQ you&#39;ve got access to the Office suite).  I will convert it<br/>
to HTML when its finished since I refuse to use FrontPage or another MS html<br/>
tool. Try it: saving the exact same file via excel&#39;s horrible toHTML<br/>
converter resulted in a 872 kB file.<br/>

I have a grandiose idea that it could also incorporate the best song to<br/>
twist with and the third voice to weave in as well should you feel inclined.<br/>
Obviously this changes with level, so an idea would be to have a simple<br/>
javascript or layer thingy that when you clicked on the diagonal the<br/>
appropriate dancing partners where illuminated, but that&#39;s a ways off since<br/>
the chart isn&#39;t even complete. :)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I&#39;m trying to think of a cute little name for it all.  Ideas so far<br/>
include Tuning Chart, Transposed Chart, Setlist, Playlist, The EQ Top 50.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all.</div>
