<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005026842">If you&#39;re looking to play on a less populated server, check out the test<br/>
server.  Theres normally less than 300 people on that server, and pretty<br/>
much everyone knows everyone else from what I&#39;ve read.  I would play there<br/>
if I didn&#39;t have 4 characters in a guild on Tunare.<br/>

&gt; Sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;Crier stares into the distance imagining what it would be like to have a<br/>
&gt; group listen to her advice.&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would be so nice if a group I was in would listen to me when I tell<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; things like this.  Maybe I&#39;m just not tactful enough (although I genuinely<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; to be), but when I get into a group of 5 or 6 people there&#39;s always at<br/>
least<br/>
&gt; one guy (and usually more) who just doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;, or says &quot;Who made<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; God?&quot; when I try and tell them that I can control the fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the cursing, but this sort of advice is generally greeted with a<br/>
&gt; &quot;Fuck you.  Check this bossy bard out...  Don&#39;t tell me how to play my<br/>
&gt; character.&quot;, usually from a warrior or a necromancer (often Dark Elves for<br/>
&gt; some reason).  I implore my group to let me lullaby mobs and yet they<br/>
continue<br/>
&gt; to, fight after fight, attack multiples.  Even if I stand there and lull,<br/>
&gt; lull, lull shouting &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot;<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; just won&#39;t do it.  This isn&#39;t just one group, it&#39;s probably 8 out of 10.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; discouraging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part of my problem might be that I play on Fennin Ro.  That server is<br/>
almost<br/>
&gt; ALWAYS at the bottom of the list when sorted by number of players.<br/>
Usually<br/>
&gt; 1,700 or 1,800, even on a weeknight.  Weekends, forget it.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
Fennin<br/>
&gt; Ro hit 1,900.  Them&#39;s some crowded zones.  Playing EQ on Fennin Ro is<br/>
&gt; oftentimes like playing Quake.  Four groups camp something and the instant<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; spawns they&#39;re all blasting for all they&#39;re worth.  I have gotten to the<br/>
point<br/>
&gt; where I refuse to play in Highpass Hold.  The people camping the Orcs are<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; of the rudest, Kill Stealing-est, nastiest and most juvenile players I&#39;ve<br/>
ever<br/>
&gt; encountered in any game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s gotten to the point where I would consider abandoning my 21st level<br/>
bard<br/>
&gt; on Fennin Ro and start a new bard on another server if I thought the<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; were friendlier.  What do you people on the (slightly) less busy servers<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to say?  Are they any friendlier?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After this group broke up, I joined one of the best groups I have ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; been in.  We had me, a warrior, a shadow knight, a paladin, a ranger and<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; shaman all level 30-34 and we were fighting in the throne room.  I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; using Pixie Strike (my new favoirte song), Lullaby, Anthem, Hymn, Psalm<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cooling and Constant Chain depending on the situation and we were the<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; &gt; group there for a few hours.  We cleared both floors of the house and<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; &gt; about a 5 minute break before things started respawning.  It was simply<br/>
&gt; &gt; amazing... We handled some insane pulls (2 heralds, 1 justicar, 1<br/>
monkey,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 zealot, 1 fanatic), never started a train, never died, and gained a<br/>
lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; of experience (a bubble and a half of level 30 in 4 hours) and cash<br/>
(100pp<br/>
&gt; &gt; after selling the 10 fine steel weapons I got).  Best of all.. i never<br/>
&gt; &gt; unequipped my lute :).<br/>
&gt; &gt; The tactics for various situations were:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 non-caster: twist Anthem, Hymn and Psalm of Cooling.  If the ranger<br/>
&gt; &gt; couldnt snare it, Chain it when it starts to run.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 caster: Pixie Strike over and over and over to interrupt the spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is very effective against the shaman we were fighting as it stopped<br/>
&gt; &gt; the heals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 non casters: Pixie Strike until it succeeds, then Hymn, repeat.  Keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; the mob that isnt being attacked messed and still heal everyone.. Save<br/>
&gt; &gt; that shaman mana. When one dies, switch to the 1 mob scenario<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 casters or mixed: Lullaby over and over again.  This will interrupt<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; caster(s) and keep one mob sleeped most of the time. When 1 dies, switch<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the 1 mob scenario<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 or more: Lullaby over and over again. Most mobs are sleeping which<br/>
&gt; &gt; helps when there are multiple healers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; For these tactics to work you MUST teach everyone to /assist the puller.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It usually takes about 30 minutes to convince the meleers who arent used<br/>
&gt; &gt; to grouping with an enchanter or a bard to usually ignore the mobs who<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the shaman or the new mob that just spawned and joined in and let me<br/>
&gt; &gt; handle it. So drill it into their heads:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot; (this happened twice last night<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I couldnt mesmerize the mob off the dotter.. he learned)<br/>
&gt; &gt; and best of all when you first join the group or when someone new<br/>
joins...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Hello my name is Celandro Spellsong and I will be your substitute<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter for the night.  Adjust your play accordingly.&quot;<br/>
