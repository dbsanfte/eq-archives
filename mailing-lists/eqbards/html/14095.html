&gt; &gt; The warping in Q Hills is definitely NOT (ooh sorry Harm, sir 20 lashes) <br/>

&gt; &gt; function of bandwidth or ping.  The warping in Q Hills makes things that <br/>

&gt; &gt; away reappear at the zone line to Qeynos every time.  Its different, and<br/>

&gt;Ah, you&#39;re talking about pathing warping, not display warping.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; with that warping anyhow?  How does it get so confused, the pathing in Q<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hills must really suck.  Hmm maybe they just copied the pathing code <br/>
&gt;from BB<br/>
&gt; &gt; over and they can&#39;t find the ramps.  8p<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think it&#39;s just a failsafe they put in, like how players are<br/>
&gt;deposited at a &quot;safe location&quot; if you fall under the world.<br/>
&gt;If a mob can&#39;t path to a target, the game assumes it&#39;s stuck<br/>
&gt;and warps it to a known &quot;safe&quot; spot.  In theory, once you fix<br/>
&gt;all the buggy spots, the warping goes away.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last night in Sol B we had 2 groups doing FGs.  We got off to a rough start <br/>
with the first two.  The first one went down with out to much trouble, but <br/>
the second one was a real pain.  Then to top it deciced to run when it was <br/>
nearly dead.  Well it got stuck in the wall and warped back to it&#39;s spawn <br/>
point and was reset to full HPs! ouch.  It was a blast though doing FGs with <br/>
just two groups, very challenging.<br/>
