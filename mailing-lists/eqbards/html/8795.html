<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738175564">I don&#39;t know where they got this idea of a named gypsy musician.  it&#39;s the<br/>
opposite.  Mynthi Davissi is the named gypsy musician, she drops the Lute of<br/>
the Gypsy Princess.  it is the regular non-named gypsy musicians in the<br/>
piano room that will drop the correct Gypsy Lute.  i was not reimbursed for<br/>
anything, because in fact i was wrong.  i feel dumb now too, of course in<br/>
hindsight.  every other item needed for lambent armor is a lore item/no drop<br/>
off a non-named common mob, whereas the LotGP is off a rare named mob, and<br/>
is neither lore nor no drop.  oh well, i went back to mistmoore and got the<br/>
correct lute, another carapace and lambent stone, and got the breastplate.<br/>
i also have the gauntlets, one bracer, arms, and boots.  i have 1 of 2 items<br/>
for the legs and another bracer.  i know someone who has gotten legs and a<br/>
helm, therefore every quest is working properly.  i won&#39;t go after the helm<br/>
since i won&#39;t wear a helm =)<br/>

p.s. what nicknames are floating around other servers?  Blueberry seems to<br/>
be the prevailing one on mine for any bards with lambent armor =)<br/>

&gt; by Samlor<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Lambent BP takes a gypsy lute off a named gypsy musician, <br/>
&gt; not the lute<br/>
&gt; of the gypsy princess. I&#39;d like to give props to Devspawn, Xandelwyn,<br/>
&gt; Ming, Norl and Parthos for helping me get this mofo.<br/>
