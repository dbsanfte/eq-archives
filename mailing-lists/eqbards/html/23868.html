<div id="ygrps-yiv-8914140">When people do this - I say &quot;Please don&#39;t tell me how to play my class -<br/>
since I&#39;m not telling you how to play yours&quot; - of course if people try to<br/>
imply you&#39;re not a good bard - you may even offer to leave the group so they<br/>
can find a better when (which essentially you did and just avoided a<br/>
confrontation)<br/>
<br/>
On a separate note - I was in the Hole - and highest level in the group<br/>
(first time in ages) - so I was elected to pull - I know bards make good<br/>
pullers - but I usually don&#39;t.  Anyway - we&#39;re in the pit and I go to pull<br/>
and am all the way to the door to the castle thing - when I go link dead.<br/>
<br/>
Now - I&#39;ve had zero PL and decent ping times all night.  I have DSL and the<br/>
majority of the time my connection is flawless - so why of all times - does<br/>
the system have to drop me at literally the worst possible moment...<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say - when I finally was able to get back on - I was dead.<br/>
Can&#39;t complain too much because one of the people in my group had another<br/>
character that was a cleric with the epic - but still - just my luck!<br/>

<br/>
Well, it finally happened to me.  I haven&#39;t played in a lot of pickup<br/>
groups, but have done a bit.  And until now, I&#39;ve not heard this phrase<br/>
uttered.  I thought I had escaped it.  But noooooooooo... the pickup group I<br/>
got last night was the WORST I&#39;ve had in EQ that I can remember.<br/>
<br/>
Players: Bardette, Monk, Ranger, Paladin, Shaman, Wizard (all between 43 and<br/>
45)<br/>
Scene: Solb<br/>
<br/>
The wizard &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing manasong?&quot;... me... &quot;uh, I am&quot;...<br/>
her...&quot;well just play it all the time&quot;.... me ... &quot;nope&quot;... her... &quot;well you<br/>
aren&#39;t a very good bard are you?&quot;... me... &quot;nope&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The paladin &quot;Tani, you need to play regen now&quot;... me ... &quot;well this song<br/>
does both so just sit tight&quot;... her...&quot;well i want to regen first then get<br/>
mana&quot; ... me.. &quot;that&#39;s nice&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Ok so I was a little sarcastic, but I wont even get into the pulling<br/>
techniques used by the ranger... Needless to say, I took the advice of<br/>
someone here and with a &quot;OMG I think my roommate just dropped something bad<br/>
.. heard a crash have to go check it out&quot;.. I logged... but wowowowow...<br/>
what an experience.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a nice weekend and a little laugh from my story :)<br/>
