<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339462153">Just a hint to your friend, if he wants to improve his roleplaying skills,<br/>
and get more stuff handed his way, try talking more like a woman.  When was<br/>
the last time you ever heard a woman say &quot;Hey dude, can I get a bind?&quot;  Heh,<br/>
heh the lingo gives them away almost every time.  And according to<br/>
Allakhazam&#39;s Poll, wood elf women were voted the most sexy in all Norrath.<br/>

Ok Im done with the twinking debate as I said before, but I have to bring up<br/>
a funny anicdote :)<br/>
<br/>
I have two friends who play female characters.  One is a Druid, whom ive<br/>
mentioned in previous posts.   And another is a Cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Ironicly the Cleric is played by a guy I know, and he hardly ever gets<br/>
anyone offering to give his character stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But the Druid is played by a really good female friend of mine, and people<br/>
just dump loot on her all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this is because people can see through the Clerics false<br/>
gender??? or is it just that Wood Elf Druids are Cuter that High Elf Clerics<br/>
:)  The truth may never be known :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
Nina<br/>
