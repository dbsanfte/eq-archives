&gt;just wanted to comment on the camping thing...at lower level yes..making<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the item always available will have people camping it to sell...but as you<br/>
get higher level cash becomes less and less relevant(for the most part) as<br/>
most people will only trade item for item....So at high level making the<br/>
item ultra rare on a already rare spawn only makes the camping worse.<br/>
<br/>
The perfect example altough not a &#39;high&#39; level item is the journeyman<br/>
boots..if you dont already have a pair from before the patch awhile back<br/>
,,,good luck in getting them...as a bard i didnt really need them but went<br/>
anyway to see if i could get a pair ..of course when i got there ..there<br/>
was 10 people camping the room...i knew a few of them and asked any<br/>
luck??..no not 1 pair and they had been there for 10 hours...now with the<br/>
boots they are no trade anyway so people arent gonna keep camping if they<br/>
get a pair..so with verant making them that hard to get all it does it make<br/>
camping worse..i also feel this rewards the gamer that has all day to play<br/>
and completly screws the casual player who only plays a few hours a day...i<br/>
mean #1 the room is constantly camped and #2 if the casual player does get<br/>
to kill the rare who drops them the odds they will get a pair is ridicously<br/>
low.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway i think the making more items lore is a good step..but the ultra<br/>
rarity of some items that are now so well known and camped is kind of<br/>
stupid...of course just mho<br/>
