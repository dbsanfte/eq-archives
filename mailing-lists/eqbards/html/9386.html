<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490288629">Hmm, I just went and looked at the song listing there and thought hmm, it<br/>
might be interesting to see all of our songs sorted by the instrument that<br/>
enhances them - so I cut and pasted into excel and got a sorted list.<br/>
Looking it over I notice that both charm and mez are listed as enhanced by<br/>
wind instruments!  Wow - is that right?  I mean do they show significant<br/>
benefit when played with a wind instrument?  That could explain why they<br/>
seemed so very weak to me.  Ie my charms were very short, etc. Something to<br/>
try tonight Look out Choon and Froon here I come and I got my mino horn in a<br/>
little bag around my wrist!!!<br/>
