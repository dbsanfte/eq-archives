<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982712061">It seems that I was incorrect in a posting earlier this week (and in my<br/>
bard guide on EQVault).  Hymn of Restoration now appears to cause a<br/>
regenerative effect, rather that a heal per pulse effect.  So if you<br/>
start the Hymn, then turn the song off, you still heal at the increased<br/>
rate for the duration of the song effect (while the icon remains on the<br/>
screen).  This is not how it behaved early in beta, but it&#39;s good news<br/>
for us bards.<br/>
<br/>
The way it seems to work, and it&#39;s understandable how I was confused<br/>
when you see how it works, is that when the first pulse kicks in, your<br/>
health goes up by the appropriate amount (which is something like 3 plus<br/>
one per six levels plus 2 if you&#39;re holding an instrument and plus 2 if<br/>
you&#39;re seated).  There are then approximately two more &quot;ticks&quot; where<br/>
your health will go up again.  These &quot;ticks&quot; are synchronized with the<br/>
song&#39;s pulses, and will occur even if you stop singing.  <br/>
<br/>
The amount that the &quot;tick&quot; heals is probably determined by<br/>
instrument/sitting etc. at the time of the tick, rather than the time of<br/>
the original pulse, so standing up after the first tick will probably<br/>
reduce the amount you are healed on the second and third tick.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t verified this though.<br/>
