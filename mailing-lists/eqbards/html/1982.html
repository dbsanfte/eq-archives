well-balanced for the L20-30 range.  Dvinn is easily killed by<br/>
a coordinated group in the high teens/low 20s.  My small<br/>
group, L21 rogue, 20 cleric, 20 bard almost managed it with<br/>
just the three of us (the AI was smart enough to attack the<br/>
cleric every time she tried to heal us - kudos to the dev team<br/>
for that).  When I was there a couple days before with a full<br/>
group of L18-21, we killed him and nobody dropped below 3<br/>
bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
He yields a weapon that easily outclasses a well-balanced<br/>
weapon much less combines (which are in the 50pp range), and<br/>
he yields it every 15-20 minutes.  It is out of whack with the<br/>
difficulty of obtaining any other similar weapon.<br/>
