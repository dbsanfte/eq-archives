<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724435645">here&#39;s a quote from Gordon:<br/>
<br/>
When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes song), chains (level 23 non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target mes song) be fixed? <br/>
<br/>
Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we&#39;ve had some other things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding chains, it&#39;s working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is that it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn&#39;t necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we&#39;ve determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<br/>
