<div id="ygrps-yiv-112884329">I agree with you on how players need to learn how to do the optimum amount<br/>
of damage.<br/>
<br/>
At first, I waded in and did whatever I could damage wise.  I was amazed<br/>
that my cleric would save me sometimes.  I kinda got used to dieing and<br/>
getting ressed. Levels 25 to 35.  My regular group passed me in levels and<br/>
got to 50 way before me.  Eventually, I caught up and by then I adjusted my<br/>
role more towards: staying alive, keeping my ench and cleric alive and full<br/>
of mana and health.  At level 48-51 (average of the group) in the planes,<br/>
you get smooshed - alot - if you melee and such.  In fact, at the suggestion<br/>
of my cleric, played mana song in combat (to mitigate mob agro on me as much<br/>
as help him) and went to using 1 wep and a shimmering orb.  I found that I<br/>
could stay alive and hopefully keep my cleric and ench alive longer.  Since<br/>
they are true force multipliers, I believe that is a better job than trying<br/>
to out melee dameage the shaman&#39;s pet.<br/>
<br/>
But what I referred to the younger bards was how to use songs with<br/>
instruments to do the all instrument attack - tyoically soloing.  The points<br/>
you make are quite valid.<br/>

While I agree with this, I also would like to point out something.. you<br/>
often don&#39;t WANT to be doing &quot;maxium damage&quot; in a group.  Sure we wear plate<br/>
and have decent AC but in a balanced group, warriors and SK need to be<br/>
absorbing the damage.  If you are blaring away on your chants, doing enough<br/>
damage that you are overcoming the warrior&#39;s taunt button, thats not<br/>
healthy.  I think a lot of bards fall into this trap.. its like the rangers<br/>
who choose high-procing weapons and dex over AC, and wonder why they die all<br/>
the time and why their cleric hates them.  Wait til the fight is well under<br/>
way, and the aggro firmly fixed on the tank before bringing out the high<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, maybe I&#39;m wrong :)<br/>
