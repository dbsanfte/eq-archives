<b>Subject:</b> Charm after patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-366708106">I got a tell from Cleaver on Fennin Ro last night (Hi Cleaver!) about Charm.<br/>
He was naturally enough curious as to whether I&#39;d seen a message to the<br/>
effect that &quot;Your charm has broken!&quot; as was billed in the patch text.  I had<br/>
not, and am sure disappointed about it.  Has anyone found circumstances in<br/>
which we do receive a &quot;charm breaks&quot; message?  Otherwise I chalk it up to a<br/>
bug or flat-out mistake, like as the &quot;You have gotten better at<br/>
Swimming(71/90)&quot; type messages that we never got.<br/>
