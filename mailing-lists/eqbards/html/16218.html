  I&#39;ve seen the Lord with a Yk more than I&#39;ve seen the Crusader with<br/>
  the RF.  Plus there&#39;s much more to go through to get to the Live<br/>
  Tower.  To reach the Lord is a walk, jump, and a run away. ;-)<br/>

  Harm, first Yk at L40 from the Lord room after two lost randoms.</div>
