<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So anyway, now that I&#39;ve gone and bad-mouthed bards to my fellow<br/>
&gt;adventurers, they&#39;re all looking at my character as the weak link in the<br/>
&gt;group.   Any advice on how best to group with a cleric, wizard, and<br/>
&gt;warrior?  I&#39;m at level 5 now and will probably join the wizard right away.<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be joined by the warrior or cleric until level 8 or so<br/>
&gt;though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

has...twist it with chant of battle til you get hymn of restoration. Chords<br/>
are nice but dangerous as can attract too muuch attention! When you hit 8<br/>
and join with your warrior friend try chant/ lament or chant/ lament / hymn<br/>
if you can get 3 up.. just an old timers views on low lvl songs.  Once you<br/>
hit 10 anthem replaces chant in your arsenal..12 ad a bellow to the lineup<br/>
as an alternative....Selo is of course an ALWAYS memmed song for those tight<br/>
spots! Good luck to you..we will be rooting for you!<br/>
