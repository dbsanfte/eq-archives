song timer cannot be removed as far as i know. but it helped me to twist 4<br/>
songs, never managed that before. otherwise try to ignore it.<br/>
<br/>
level 52 haste song should give 15% haste, but it allows to exceed the<br/>
maximum haste cap. it is also an AE song, effecting all players around you,<br/>
not just your group (same as the chorus resistsongs and the 58 manasong).<br/>
sadly, the song seems to be bugged. had some situations where it caused<br/>
people to hit very slowly instead of faster.<br/>
<br/>

Betreff: [eqbards] silly questions from an old timer<br/>
<br/>
Well, I took a break from eq when daoc came out, and honestly love daoc, but<br/>
dying 3 times in a row at 30+ hurts like hell and is pretty demoralizing,<br/>
and well I kinda missed my eq guild (people are less chatty in daoc). So I<br/>
reactivated my account last night and am back in eq...<br/>
<br/>
Question for the lot of ya:<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to disable the song timer? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s driving me nuts, its throwing my timing off when I&#39;m twisting songs.  <br/>
Oh and another question, is the new 52 haste song better then the 54 haste<br/>
we have from before?<br/>
<br/>
sorry, I been out of the loop for bout 3-4 months, trying to read up on as<br/>
much as possible in a short time.<br/>
