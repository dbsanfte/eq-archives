<div id="ygrps-yiv-37875776"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; example closely, you&#39;ll note that only the first pass was my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;run through the zone&quot;. The others were me trying to recover<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d have to question the wisdom of your actions them.  The<br/>
&gt; first thing I would&#39;ve done since you weren&#39;t successful at<br/>
&gt; getting a bind in Highpass, is run to Qeynos and request a<br/>
&gt; bind there.  Yam it up with a sob story about being killed by<br/>
&gt; Chief Goonda while bound in Freeport.  I&#39;d have to say 3 of<br/>
&gt; your Freeport-&gt;Karana runs were self-inflicted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spiffy, I&#39;m an unwise player. Guess we can&#39;t all be as wise<br/>
as you. I&#39;m not going to bother debating your reply as I<br/>
addressed all of your points in my original example. As for<br/>
runs being self-inflicted, you got me. I just love to die<br/>
and run around naked so much that I do it intentionally as<br/>
far away as I can.<br/>
<br/>
Just call me the streak..</div>
