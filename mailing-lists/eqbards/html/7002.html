&gt; Lowering deviation from average however, does increase predictability<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; means less dying.  The faster weapon means you&#39;ll die less from mobs you<br/>
&gt; have easily killed before, while with a higher damage weapon you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; sometimes easily beat a white con andthen get thoroughly trounced by the<br/>
&gt; same white con the very next time.  Fast weapons are the best defense<br/>
&gt; against clumpy random number generation.  Missing 5 times in a row with my<br/>
&gt; Dirk is meaningless in a fight where I have to hit 100 times anyway.<br/>
&gt; Missing 5 straight times with a delay 45 weapon is equivalent to 10 plus<br/>
&gt; straght misses  and will cause death.  Of course 5 straight hits are as<br/>
&gt; advantageous as the misses are disad., but its the lack of predictability<br/>
&gt; that kills.  Can I take this blue dangerous?  Only if I don&#39;t get bad<br/>
&gt; luck,<br/>
&gt; whereas with the faster wepon you generally know what you can handle and<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t after trying it once.<br/>

the log parsing programs.  They show damage/time, as well as %hit, and<br/>
several other stats..  Try several different combinations of weapons, and<br/>
find which seems to be the best total damage/time<br/>
