<div id="ygrps-yiv-515707529">I agree totally.  I was very careful when I worded that statement.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t apply to a group where you are filling the holes nearly as much as<br/>
it does to a balanced group.<br/>
<br/>
My experiences are probably different from most, though given my preferred<br/>
places to hunt.  I don&#39;t hunt outdoors, I don&#39;t like it.  I&#39;m a dungeon<br/>
addict to the extreme.  I also like to make a group and go to a dungeon<br/>
where there just aren&#39;t any people around except a couple groups.  This<br/>
combination means that more often than not, I&#39;m in a balanced group.<br/>
