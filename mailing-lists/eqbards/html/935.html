<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-600889198">Greetings and welcome fellow of the arts.<br/>
Well let us see what knowlege we can bestow.<br/>
<br/>
The level 8 Lull song as you call it is targeted.  Be close enough to <br/>
your target that it works but not so close they respond to you.<br/>
Target one then play the song.  they should glow purple similar<br/>
to the accelerando aura and be sad.  I have yet to get this to work<br/>
on more then one target.<br/>
<br/>
For money te best options are Wisps which themselves are of<br/>
moderate worth, their lightstones range from 1-5pp depending on<br/>
the type. Dervish thieves also have bronze weapons yeilding about 3 plat.<br/>
With a good set of friends you can try gluck and get netted and woven armor<br/>
to sell to monks and wizards,magician,necros. For around 5 plat.<br/>

&gt;      Hello all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	 A couple of questions from a new bard on your list. (I apologize<br/>
&gt;      if these have been asked before) BTW, this is by far the most<br/>
&gt;      interesting and mature Everquest list that I have seen so far.  Must<br/>
&gt;      say something about the type of person that enjoys playing a bard.<br/>
&gt;      (join the EQ_clerics list for a bit and you&#39;ll see what I mean...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?	Is it an area<br/>
&gt;      effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a step<br/>
&gt;      by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group<br/>
&gt;      of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      2.  Did anyone else notice how quiet it was last night on the<br/>
&gt;      Everquest servers?  They only had about 60%  of their normal<br/>
&gt;      population.  Guess there is a strong correlation between playing<br/>
&gt;      Everquest and being a Star Wars fan...   :smiles knowingly.<br/>
&gt;      I expect that the next few days may be a good time to grab some<br/>
&gt;      experience at those place that always seem to be over camped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      3.  I am a Level 10 human Bard.  I usually party with an Enchanter<br/>
&gt;      (good combo, the pet tanks, she zaps and I tank/support) but I am<br/>
&gt;      rather poor.  Any good suggestions on location or MOBS that garner a<br/>
&gt;      goodly amount of loot so I can finish my banded ensemble?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      Bujold (Xegony) (look no e.. :))<br/>
