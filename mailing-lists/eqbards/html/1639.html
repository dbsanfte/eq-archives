<b>Subject:</b> Cracked Flute <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441056939">Was standing around playing my flute the other day (most folks haven&#39;t seen<br/>
this animation, and it certainly seems to entertain them), drunk as a giant<br/>
skunk, and some fellow asked me if I knew what a cracked flute did.  I told<br/>
him I&#39;d never heard of it, and remarked it sounded as if a &quot;cracked&quot; flute<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work every well.  He told me it was involved with a quest, but<br/>
before I could get any more information out of him his party group gated<br/>
away.  Wondering if this is a broken flute for some quest delivery, or<br/>
perhaps something nice to have.  Think the fellow wondered the same thing,<br/>
probably would have sold it to me for 200 pp or some such nonsense.  He was<br/>
high-level, so may be a higher level quest?  (Sigh... where do you start<br/>
higher level quests anyway??)<br/>
