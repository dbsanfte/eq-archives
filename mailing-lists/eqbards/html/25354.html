Grats on the loot.  You made out pretty nice. I bet you skipped out one or<br/>
two things, like how the guild&#39;s in-crowd is now in your debt and you<br/>
probably now have an open invitation to raids you want to attend. :-)<br/>

Well, you guys asked me to let you know what I got for the Horn in the<br/>
end. To bring you up to date, I lucked into a Horn of Hsagra, doing a<br/>
low-level quest in Ak&#39;Anon (probably due to a loot-table mixup). I offered<br/>
it to a friend of mine who is in a guild, and he said to write my own<br/>
ticket. So I did. I requested the Lute of the Howler, and some coins for<br/>
the Nostrolo Tambourine quest. I didn&#39;t expect to get all of that, but I<br/>
was hopeful.<br/>
<br/>
Today I got a call, requesting my presence in West Commons. There, I was<br/>
presented, in trade for the Horn, a bag containing one Lute of the Howler,<br/>
6 Ancient Coins, and 18 peridots.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say I did well.<br/>

P.S. What level can I use the Lute&#39;s illusion?<br/>
