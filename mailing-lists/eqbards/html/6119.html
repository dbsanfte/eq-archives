<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071269955">I have always referred to this tactic as Bard Nuking.  You create a hot key <br/>
bank with your secondary weapon slot and one general inventory slot.  Hot <br/>
key the following songs: Denon&#39;s disruptive discord, Chords of dissounces, <br/>
Hymn of restoration, and Psalm of Warmth (the last is a personal favorite <br/>
due to the damage shield).<br/>
<br/>
Equip your horn and have your lute &#39;held&#39; on your mouse pointer. Fire off <br/>
DDD, when the wince message flashes stop DDD and start CoD while equiping <br/>
your Lute.  When the wince message shows, start either Hynm or Psalm <br/>
depending on the flow of battle.  When the third song starts, stop it and <br/>
restart DDD while equiping your horn.<br/>
<br/>
The benefits are huge for this DDD does around 20 damage a round (round = 6 <br/>
seconds) for 3 rounds (first round plus two more) it also lowers AC making <br/>
it easier for tanks to hit for more damage. CoD does around 14 damage a <br/>
round for 3 rounds.  Since both these songs are AE this damage is done to <br/>
all your targets (which can draw alot of attention to the bard).  Hymn will <br/>
of course heal the whole party every round.  Psalm is great in that it gives <br/>
all party members a 5 pt fire based damage shield that stacks with all other <br/>
non-cold based damage shields.  Besure to have a good cleric around as if <br/>
there is more the 2 or 3 mobs you will get pounded hard.<br/>

&gt;Hail all,<br/>
&gt;I am level 24, armed with a dragoon dirk and a Polished Granite tomahawk.<br/>
&gt;Recently  a level 29 bard stopped by our group in SolA with a train <br/>
&gt;*laughs*<br/>
&gt;and ended up getting the kill with his horn on several goblins. I was<br/>
&gt;flabergasted (given that we have a level 28 warrior and level 26 cleric and<br/>
&gt;wizard). So I have been playing the the horn and Dennons Dischord  then<br/>
&gt;swapping to the lute for chains or lull, then back to the horn. It&#39;s really<br/>
&gt;really hard to say, but I MAY be doing more damage now...do we have hard<br/>
&gt;figures on DDD? I am very very curious.<br/>
