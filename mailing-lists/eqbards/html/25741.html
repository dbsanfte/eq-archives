<div id="ygrps-yiv-670514142">He is something akin to Ragefire, he seems to spawn several times<br/>
between the &#39;real&#39; Trakanon.  It seems to be a random amount of time as<br/>
well, between 12 and 36 hours I&#39;ve been told most often, though some say<br/>
as much as 72.  Haven&#39;t sat and timed him myself so I can&#39;t say for<br/>
sure.<br/>

<br/>
OK, Trakanon is down, undead bard spawns around 18 hours later.  he is<br/>
killed.<br/>
Does he spawn again before (the real) Trakanon does or do I need to<br/>
wait?  Anybody know?<br/>
Really frustrating not knowing if the guy is up until you are<br/>
practically on top of him.  Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.<br/>
