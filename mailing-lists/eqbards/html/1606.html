&gt; At 10:00 AM 6/7/99 -1000, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt;Here is what I would like to know:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was supposed to<br/>
&gt; &gt;happen?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That sounds like a bug.  Everyone else I&#39;ve heard has told me that it<br/>
&gt; simply stops you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get<br/>
&gt; stuck again if I<br/>
&gt; &gt;try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to pull my<br/>
&gt; &gt;corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You should be able to /corpse it from anywhere.  I&#39;ve even heard that now<br/>
&gt; you can /corpse out of Lava (perhaps they increased the /corpse range).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is probably still only on the test server, like the /follow command,<br/>
and, what I read was that you can&#39;t /corpse from lava, but you can /loot.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s corpse?  My<br/>
&gt; &gt;theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but<br/>
&gt; in the Ocean<br/>
&gt; &gt;of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the right<br/>
&gt; &gt;direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you<br/>
&gt; are looking<br/>
&gt; &gt;for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of Tears zone<br/>
&gt; &gt;then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse<br/>
&gt; was in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MAJOR bug there.  Unless his corpse was beneath the world - in which case,<br/>
&gt; it DID lead you to him. Only his body was a million miles under you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IF his corpse was in the OOT zone, then you should have received a message<br/>
like:<br/>
&quot;There is no corpse by that identification in this zone&quot; or similar.  I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten<br/>
that a few times, when a player has a) lost a corpse or b) was just confused<br/>
about<br/>
which zone they actually died in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most likely an NPC, actually - probably one who was lost.  Possibly a Bard<br/>
&gt; with Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, but you&#39;d have to ask around.  FYI in weird<br/>
&gt; situations, don&#39;t be afraid to hammer on the &quot;Screenshot&quot; key a few times.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s amazing what details you missed that you can locate later from a<br/>
&gt; screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some NPC&#39;s don&#39;t seem to have a &#39;swimming&#39; animation.  Once, at the docks in<br/>
Freeport, I was swimming around, and the girl that normally stands on the<br/>
end of<br/>
the dock was down on the ocean floor, still fishing.  So this could have<br/>
been an NPC<br/>
that wandered off the beaten path.  I&#39;m not real familiar with the BB zone,<br/>
but I<br/>
don&#39;t remember any wandering human or elf NPC&#39;s, at least not near the<br/>
docks.  There<br/>
are some elves there at the docks though they don&#39;t seem to walk around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to /petition.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>
&gt; &gt;retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I sure<br/>
&gt; &gt;hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>
&gt; retrieve it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They will certainly retrieve his - but what I would do is petition a GM<br/>
&gt; with the initial problem, and then offer to attempt the retrieval on your<br/>
&gt; own, if they will watch to make sure that you do not get trapped<br/>
&gt; again.  It<br/>
&gt; DOES seem to be a bug, but it&#39;s not verifiable (like a corpse under the<br/>
&gt; world is) so they will be hard pressed to prove it, and the hard rule is<br/>
&gt; &quot;If you cannot prove it was a bug, you cannot help them.&quot;  You can mention<br/>
&gt; to them that the reason you want them to &quot;watch over you&quot; is because the<br/>
&gt; bug will likely cause you to die before you can /corpse your body.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh - and have you thought about using the jig o&#39; vigor to restore<br/>
&gt; your lost<br/>
&gt; stamina?  I never thought about it before...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh...I crashed in the OOT zone, once.  My ISP dropped out from under me,<br/>
and<br/>
when I finally got back in, I was at the ocean floor.  I swam over<br/>
hmm...half the<br/>
zone (I was halfway between the two dock islands).  I kept the jig going the<br/>
entire time, and never once did my stamina bar drop.  And, my swimming skill<br/>
went<br/>
from nearly nothing (5 or 6) to about 35 during that swim.  Pretty boring,<br/>
actually.<br/>
