<div id="ygrps-yiv-303621863">Pulled a guild-grind in the Siren&#39;s Grotto over the weekend.  3 groups of 49+ camped near the waterfall for an afternoon of non-stop pulling.  Many, many conch shell horns and immaculent conch shells dropped...and a walrus skin drum.<br/>
lots of other stuff dropped too, including gems and a Wavecrasher (I lost the lotto for it but at least I got the drum).<br/>
Some advice for bards headed that way -- <br/>
Psalm of warmth, pixie strike against watery/icey servants who cast drake-type AOE attacks<br/>
Enticing sirens swarm bards who use charm (but it also may be because I was the lowest in my group) <br/>
Our master looter was dropping runed shell necklaces on the ground along with non-quest gems.  Runed shell necklaces have five charges of enduring breath on them and sell to vendors for 11pp and change.  I picked up a fair amount of trash that day and sang all the way to the bank ;-)<br/>
