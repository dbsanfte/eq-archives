<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588474039">I&#39;ve used both weapons, and I would say go with the barbed whip. I&#39;ve<br/>
used both, and I defintely prefer the whip. Why? The whip usually sells<br/>
for 100pp compared to the PGT which sells for around 200pp. Big help<br/>
there. You say you can afford the PGT, and you want that cool berserk<br/>
effect though? That effect is useless. When you first get it in your<br/>
high teens its somewhat helpful, but when you move into your mid-20s its<br/>
useless and a detriment sometimes. Right now I gain 20 str, and lose 12<br/>
agi(as I grow in levels I see to lose more agi; I originally lost only 8<br/>
agi). That 12 agi loss is a BIG thing, and that magic skin you get maybe<br/>
lasts you a round or two in battle. Stuff that I hunt at 25 can easily<br/>
hit for over 100hp if it gets a good hit off(alligators in cazic fo<br/>
example), and the whole proc is gone 5 secs after it went into effect.<br/>
Sure it may have saved me from damage, but I could&#39;ve avoided that hit<br/>
without the agi loss. Get the barbed whip, its better in the long run.<br/>

&gt; I am in need of a new weapon to replace my aging combine longsword and 2 choices<br/>
&gt; that come to mind are a Barbed Whip or a Polished Granite Tomahawk. Both of<br/>
&gt; these weapons have plusses and minusses and I was wondering if anyone here had<br/>
&gt; an opinion of which, if either, is better and why. Or if you know of any other<br/>
&gt; weapons that can be bought (I hate camping) for around 100-200pp feel free to<br/>
&gt; expound on their virtues as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; P.S. A piercing weapon would work too. I already use a Dragoon Dirk as my<br/>
&gt; secondary weapon.<br/>
