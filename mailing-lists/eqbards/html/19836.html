<div id="ygrps-yiv-826559529">The spot you&#39;re looking for is right where Xanasus (sp?) the named Treant<br/>
spawns... there&#39;s a hill right in front of him where you can camp.  I<br/>
believe Griffons, Griffawns, and Griffennes are generated from this spawn<br/>
point, but I&#39;m not totally sure.  And my experience mirrors your 2nd<br/>
attempt... Many, many, many Griffennes (more than 5) before getting the<br/>
charm.  The Shaman quest item (feather I believe) seemed to be much more<br/>
common.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; point.  IIRC, someone posted a long time ago on the list a method to<br/>
&gt; guarantee a griffenne would spawn.  The poster mentioned a /loc to go to<br/>
&gt; somewhere in NK.  Does anyone remember the details of this post?  Also, I<br/>
&gt; recall someone saying that the only mobs who were placeholders for<br/>
&gt; griffennes were griffawns.  Killing the other mobs in NK will not increase<br/>
&gt; the chances of getting a griffenne to spawn.  Is that true?<br/>
