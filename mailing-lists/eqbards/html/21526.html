&quot;unintended fix&quot; Yea, that is pretty funny in a sad way.<br/>

&gt;Below is a snip that I got from EQ Vault - that was cut from the Verant<br/>
&gt;boards.  I had to chuckle that he actually used the expression &quot;unintended<br/>
&gt;fix&quot;...<br/>

&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I noticed a number of people here talking about the way that creatures<br/>
&gt;decide to flee, referring to a change that went in with the last patch.<br/>
&gt;After speaking with the programmer responsible for AI among other things,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s apparent that there was a change made while optimizing code that caused<br/>
&gt;an &quot;unintended fix&quot; to the AI. Though no one sat down and said, &quot;I&#39;m going<br/>
&gt;to make creatures flee more&quot;, that&#39;s the result.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Without going too far into specifics and formulae regarding the decision to<br/>
&gt;flee, there are several &quot;components&quot; that NPCs use to determine how brave<br/>
&gt;they are. One of the common ones that everyone knows about is the<br/>
&gt;interrelation of hitpoints and level with the attacker. One of the other<br/>
&gt;less-known components was using some uninitialized memory (memory space<br/>
&gt;allocated to a variable that hasn&#39;t yet been &#39;set&#39; to anything, and usually<br/>
&gt;contains garbage) that had the effect of making NPCs much more brave than<br/>
&gt;they should have been.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are going to discuss this in the tuning meeting Monday, but my initial<br/>
&gt;impression is that the AI is now working as it should, and I like how things<br/>
&gt;are turning out so far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What are your thoughts?<br/>
