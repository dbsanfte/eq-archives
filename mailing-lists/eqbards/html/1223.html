<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021989999">The one thing I would add is that at low levels, don&#39;t limit yourself to<br/>
1h slashing weapons and try to get your hands on a low delay 1h blunt or<br/>
piercing weapon (or better yet both) and try to keep your skills in 1h<br/>
slash and 1h blunt or piercing maxed at every level.  When you get<br/>
higher in level, magical weapons will become available and it&#39;s nice to<br/>
be able to use a variety of weapon types (especially for dual wield!).<br/>

&gt;      Subject: Newbie tips ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      I just started a bard and i was wondering if someone could give me a<br/>
&gt;      few tips...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      IF you do , reply or send me an e-mail<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      Thank you<br/>

&gt; Great, it&#39;s nice to provide an answer for a change.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  Give it a try! I think bards are the most fun of any of the classes!  I<br/>
&gt; have tried several and it&#39;s my favorite.  (lost interest it the others)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  Sing your songs all the time even when you selling.  You need all the<br/>
&gt; practice you can get to get your singing skill up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  but DON&#39;T practice with the level 2 song!!!!!  Chords of Dissonance.<br/>
&gt; Nice little damage song but it will attack everything including guards and<br/>
&gt; merchants who will kill you instantly for you pain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.  Hunt the nearest newbie area diligently.  I found it very easy to get<br/>
&gt; to 5th level in one evening of play.  The first level song and a rusty long<br/>
&gt; sword or scimitar should do the trick.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.5  Kill any orc/skel/gnoll that is holding a weapon.  These weapons are<br/>
&gt; your better loot at low levels not to mention arming yourself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5.  My favorite area to level below 10-12 is Misty Thicket near Rivervale.<br/>
&gt; If you can get there go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6.  Sell stuff at the local bards guild (if there is one) for better<br/>
&gt; prices.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 7.  Learn to fish for food.  Saves a lot of money at lower levels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 8.  Soon as you can scrape together 4 plat. go to Kelethin and buy a Mino<br/>
&gt; ax from another player.  (they are almost constantly on sale.) Should only<br/>
&gt; cost 4 palt and certainly don&#39;t pay more then 5<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 9.  Buy tattered armor from player tailors.  best money to ac ratio at<br/>
&gt; lower levels.  2-5 gold a piece.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nuff for now<br/>
