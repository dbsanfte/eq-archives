&gt;&gt; A question about the lullaby spell.  Is its area of effect centered<br/>
&gt;&gt; on you as the caster, or can you target something some distance from<br/>
&gt;&gt; you and it is centered on your target?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Centered on you.  Goatnatos&#39; guide says it also clears the<br/>
&gt;hate list.  Has anyone found this to be the case?  They always<br/>
&gt;seem to attack me when they wake up, no matter how far I run<br/>
&gt;away. I tried testing it on mobs other people were attacking<br/>
&gt;but the results were inconclusive.<br/>

Bards are public enemy #1 when singing this song.<br/>
