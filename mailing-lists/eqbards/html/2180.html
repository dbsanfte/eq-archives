Especially now that the leading middle area of Brian Hook&#39;s bell curve<br/>
is entering there. (I&#39;m glad it&#39;s getting a lot of attention, but<br/>
really, is there anyone who didn&#39;t already know that this would happen?<br/>
This is part of the reason I and many of the people I played with<br/>
powergamed our way through the first levels, to try to be able to play<br/>
areas before the huge mass of middle range players arrived. It early<br/>
became obvious that for most levels, only a few places were really<br/>
suitable, and also that they had never been designed or tested to<br/>
accomodate mass numbers of people)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you played in Unrest? If I recall I was still getting decent<br/>
experience there well into the late 20&#39;s area. Of course, when I played<br/>
there we considered 30+ ppl a crowd and now I hear it tops 100 at busy<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that it&#39;s hard to find a decent place to play at that level.<br/>
I believe Runnyeye is supposed to be good for players in the mid 20&#39;s<br/>
but my experience with almost all goblin dungeons is that they are way<br/>
more trouble than they are worth. Goblins seem to hit faster and harder<br/>
than other mobs, and until you can do the top mobs there, the loot<br/>
basically stinks. I think the front areas of Permafrost may be in the<br/>
mid 20&#39;s level as well but the same general rule seems to apply there.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what level can successfully do the elite guards and others<br/>
deeper in permafrost. By the time they got around to itemizing the<br/>
dungeon I was already L35 and they still conned blue to me but they were<br/>
the only ones that did. (other than a few specials.)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that&#39;s been bugging me a lot lately about dungeon design<br/>
is that, dispite putting big races in the game, it never seems to have<br/>
occured to anyone to design the dungeons to accomodate them. My recent<br/>
trips to nagafen&#39;s really show this up, with it&#39;s corridors so narrow<br/>
that one troll can completely block it. Heck, you cant ever squeeze past<br/>
a barbarian warrior in there. And of course the monsters can go through<br/>
PC chars, but PC chars cant go through monsters, so if a kobold goes<br/>
through your fighters to attack your wizard, getting to it to get it off<br/>
them becomes a frustrating experience.<br/>
