&gt; &gt; in order for this to be true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i think it is in fact more than 2X damage, especially with it being resisted<br/>
&gt;less (now disease based) and with the disc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; how many other classes are not extremely unimportant on <br/>
&gt; &gt; raids?  clerics, warriors,<br/>
&gt; &gt; rogues?  any others?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;shaman (HP buffs), enchanter (haste/clarity/crowd control), paladin (divine<br/>
&gt;strength), monk (huge damage, pulling) are all extremely important.  yes 200<br/>
&gt;extra HP from a 60 paladin on every person makes a huge difference, and no<br/>
&gt;bards can not do crowd control on these raids with the number of targets<br/>
&gt;exceeding our mes and charm caps.  that&#39;s 7 out of 12 that are extremely<br/>
&gt;important.  important are magician (pet damage, dispel staffs, CotH), necro<br/>
&gt;(pet damage, mana pump), wizard (spell damage, much less important in SoV<br/>
&gt;but were hugely important in Kunark). not important are SK and bard.  hell i<br/>
&gt;could be completely off on all of this, i&#39;m not the guildleader just a<br/>
&gt;grunt.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ok, except that every shaman after the first is unnecessary and every paladin after the<br/>
first and those under lvl 60 are unnecessary.  is necro mana pump really necessary?  who pumps<br/>
the necros?  their pet damage is easily replaced by a mage pet, so that alone doesn&#39;t<br/>
make them necessary.  and since you didn&#39;t even mention druids, i&#39;m assuming they<br/>
are unimportant as well, heheh.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &gt; except<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the few people in uber guilds who only go on raids, what <br/>
&gt; &gt; is the percentage of raids to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39; hunting?  maybe 90/10?  so if we&#39;re overpowered in <br/>
&gt; &gt; 90% of the game and underpowered<br/>
&gt; &gt; in 10%, doesn&#39;t that work out to being overpowered as a class?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;let&#39;s not get into percentages again, cause as you said percentages don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;matter when it is yourself in the minority.  for me, it is completely<br/>
&gt;opposite, with 90% of my time on raids, 10% grouping/exp&#39;ing.  maybe even<br/>
&gt;more skewed than that. and for the 60s in our guild, which is almost<br/>
&gt;everyone, their time is spent 100% on raids, 0% exp&#39;ing.  what else are you<br/>
&gt;going to do when you hit 60?  and every time you level isn&#39;t that what you<br/>
&gt;are one step closer towards?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i didn&#39;t say they don&#39;t matter when you are in the minority.  i said that you are not<br/>
insignificant when you are in the minority.  but when considering class balance, do<br/>
you balance the game according to what 80% of the subscribers are doing or to what<br/>
20% or less of the subscribers are doing? it&#39;s almost impossible to do both because<br/>
of all the hacks needed due to complete heal and levels post 50.  to go off on a small<br/>
tangent here, it seems that the game was designed as a 1 to 50 game, and when the<br/>
success was so large and they decided to do an expansion and allow levels 50 to 60,<br/>
they had to kludge and hack a lot of stuff together.<br/>
