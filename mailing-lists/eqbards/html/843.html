This is not completely correct.  When you&#39;re singing the identify song,<br/>
left-click an item to &quot;pick it up&quot; with the mouse pointer.  Don&#39;t put it<br/>
into an inventory slot, just leave it hanging under your mouse pointer.  On<br/>
the next pulse, a bit of textual info about the item pops up in the chat<br/>
window.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s nothing more than what you get from<br/>
right-click-and-holding on items, but it *does* work.  It&#39;s just not at all<br/>
useful at this point :-)<br/>
