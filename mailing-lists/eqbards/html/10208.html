<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891601734">Kitasi raises some good points IMO.  Although I always enjoy this type of<br/>
discussion, I think we will have to wait until the expansion comes out<br/>
before we will know what Verant has in store for the bards and other<br/>
classes.  Its too bad that Verant is tight lipped when it comes to<br/>
discussion of class mechanics.  In addition to new songs, I am hoping that<br/>
we will get new skills like parry and riposte (with caps high enough to be<br/>
useful) at some point after 50th level.  If the only thing we get are raises<br/>
to the caps of our current skills, then I for one will be quite<br/>
disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how useful it would be, but maybe the bard community (mailing<br/>
list and Concert Hall board) should bang heads together and come up with a<br/>
list of song ideas and skills that we would like to see get added with the<br/>
expansion.  The way I interpreted GZ&#39;s response to our questions, Verant<br/>
seems to be having a hard time coming up with new song ideas.  Maybe we<br/>
could help them out some.  I volunteer John Kim, Shada and Rokenn to take<br/>
the lead on this:-)<br/>
