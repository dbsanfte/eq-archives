<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048785787">I, uh...accidentlally ran past V...someone, in Firona, the high level necro,<br/>
the other day.  I never even saw him.  Suddenly, I see a dot on me.  Ok, no<br/>
problem.  This happened near the big statue at the waterfall just outside<br/>
the outpost, so I ran just a little ways back towards the outpost, figure<br/>
I&#39;m near enough the pilgrims and butterfly things (heh...forget name), and I<br/>
start hymn.   Look at health bar.  Equip lute.  Look at health bar.  Panic.<br/>
Sit.  Watch health bar dwindle to nothing.  Die.  Was funny, in it&#39;s own<br/>
little way.  I was sitting, talking in guildchat about this particular necro<br/>
(not very flattering), necros in general, and dots, and wondering if a 29<br/>
bard can live through a 50-odd level necro dot....right up until I died.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve become very aware of my surroundings now when travelling from FV to<br/>
LOIO.  :P<br/>
