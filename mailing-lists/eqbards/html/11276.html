1.	Mistmoore - no clue.  Mid 30&#39;s place afik.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Choon & Froon (gay clops?) live in West Karana on top of a hill with a<br/>
really nice view of the Oger Camp (don&#39;t get near even though they con<br/>
amiable - the Chief don&#39;t and he will harm touch for 400 and agro the rest<br/>
onto you) and the strolling Hill Giants.  If you enter West K from the NK<br/>
near the river past the Stone Bridge, go about 1/3 of the way across the<br/>
zone (hmm, kinda tough to judge if you are new to the zone) then go due<br/>
North.  Alternatively, you could follow the road thru north karana and enter<br/>
west k on the road.  Keep following it and stay out of the hills. Skirt the<br/>
bottom of the hills (snarf the ghoul messenger boy, werewolfie, and any<br/>
meandering HG&#39;s if you want) and look for a shop where Brenzl McManus sells<br/>
his fletching goods (track Brenzl if you can).  Right behind his shop - up<br/>
on the hill Choon and Froon.  Yes, if you work argo radius, you can pull em<br/>
singles, I found that out when I tried to Lament and pulled a single.<br/>
Fear-Chain-DoT-DD, rinse, repeat.  I prefer to have a helper and SoW.  I<br/>
tried to charm one time and was resisted - but that was a couple levels back<br/>
and maybe did not wear all my cha stuff.  They are prolly low 30&#39;s - high<br/>
20&#39;s? <br/>

<br/>
		Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
		I have a few questions this morning for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
		1)  Which room in Mistmoore is the home of the gypsy lute<br/>
dropping gypsies?  How do I get there?  Is there a secret way (i.e. through<br/>
the secret room in the graveyard) which could be less hazardous to a group<br/>
of around 30&#39;s? (I too share Shada&#39;s propensity for being lost - hehe.  My<br/>
train hotkey shouts &quot;TRAIN TO......UM......Just watch out!&quot;)  Once I get to<br/>
said room, how difficult a place is it?  3 spawns, 4?<br/>
<br/>
		2)  Where are Choon and Froon (I&#39;ve spent the vast majority<br/>
of my time on the East coast, so I&#39;m not too familiar with the Karanas)?<br/>
About what level are they?  Is it possible to pull one without the other?<br/>
<br/>
		And in another non-related vein:<br/>
<br/>
		Can anyone please post or supply the web address to a<br/>
comprehensive list of Bard skill caps?  And once more, where do you have to<br/>
go to train that first point in Instill Doubt?<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks ahead of time for all the help,<br/>
