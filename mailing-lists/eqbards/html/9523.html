<div id="ygrps-yiv-129114409">I can sympathize with you on the fighting issues, but you seem to be a<br/>
reasonable player.  I doubt you go around killing things that are 32 levels<br/>
below you just to see what they drop.  Unfortunately others do exactly this.<br/>
I can see &#39;No drop&#39; perhaps for items that are spawn drops they want to be<br/>
rare.  I still don&#39;t think it accomplishes what is desired without creating<br/>
more problems than it solves, but I also think only a system that includes<br/>
the wearing out or breaking of items will do this.  That would be extremely<br/>
unpopular however realistic or beneficial to the economy.  If they could<br/>
break imagine how the cost of a Dragoon Dirk would quickly move to a<br/>
reasonable price relative to the available combine weapons.  This would<br/>
definitely be a beneficial effect for the game as a whole.  Would I be in<br/>
danger of losing a lot of really neat stuff I worked hard to get?  Sure I<br/>
would, but items would not need to be so rare if they had some chance of<br/>
being lost.  Currently the only way an item ceases to exist is if there is a<br/>
bug, someone sells it to a merchant, or if the owner quits EQ and doesn&#39;t<br/>
pass on his possessions.  These are not sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
Making quest items &#39;no drop&#39; is even sillier.  Few people do any of the more<br/>
involved quests already unless the item gained is unbelievably awesome like<br/>
the armor quests.  It would seem to make sense to reward the people who are<br/>
actually interested in doing quests with an item they can make use of in<br/>
some way even if they cannot personally use it.  If you think it would suck<br/>
to have your Dragoon Dirk break when another 60pp could buy you a new one,<br/>
imagine how much it sucks to work on a quest given by an apparently<br/>
non-class specific npc for 6 weeks, only to get a &#39;no drop&#39; item you cannot<br/>
use.  A definite feeling of letdown.  At least you could build some sort of<br/>
repair system into item breakage so people could prevent items they really<br/>
cared about from breaking.  Not that most people would.<br/>

&gt; I beginning to think there should be a level check on a critter when he<br/>
dies<br/>
&gt; that his corpse disappears immediately if your level is more than a<br/>
certain<br/>
&gt; amount greater than the mob.  I was vehemently against this idea when it<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; initially proposed by Verant.  Its better than making everything &#39;no drop&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about this. There&#39;s a ton of problems with this and it<br/>
would require changes Verant won&#39;t want to make. For one, they&#39;d have to<br/>
rethink their current &quot;everything about L18 attacks&quot; setup. If I&#39;m going<br/>
to have to fight green mobs 32 levels below mine, I better at least get<br/>
loot from them, no matter how pitiful. As well, what about necros<br/>
hunting for bone chips or druids hunting for bat wings?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the way it is becoming now.  This would chase away some of the higher<br/>
levels<br/>
&gt; from lower level events however.  I think cutting it off at the xp gaining<br/>
&gt; point would be too tight though, get 4 mobs on me that are just barely too<br/>
&gt; green to give xp and I may still be in trouble depending on the zone.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s nothing I hate more than killing a new mob, only to find a cool<br/>
item<br/>
&gt; for a monk or caster that is &#39;no drop&#39;.  Normally I could give it away or<br/>
&gt; sell it to a guildmember, making it &#39;no drop&#39; just makes it useless.<br/>
Quests<br/>
&gt; are becoming especially true for this.  Do a quest and get an item you<br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use.  If this is supposed to make us do quests that are for our class only<br/>
&gt; then it sucks even worse as there are many monk and paladin quests but<br/>
&gt; nearly no bard quests.  &#39;No Drop&#39; is no solution its merely a crutch used<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; avoid a real solution.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Personally I also hate letting items go to waste, but it at least fits<br/>
in with Verant&#39;s appearant philosophy of keeping items rare by any means<br/>
possible. If they didn&#39;t have the items no drop, they&#39;d probably cut the<br/>
spawn of items even more to assure that everyone didn&#39;t have one.<br/>
