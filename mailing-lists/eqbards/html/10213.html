<div id="ygrps-yiv-783266477">Since the subject heading has the magic word in it I&#39;ll give mine.<br/>
<br/>
When the lambent quests came out, I was 23d level and assumed that it would<br/>
be impossible for me to actually complete any of the quests myself until I<br/>
was much higher in level.  So much for assuming.  I&#39;m now 27th level and I<br/>
have all the quest components except the two required for the breastplate,<br/>
the helm that gets dropped by the deepwater goblins, and the icy greaves.  I<br/>
can get the greaves whenever I decide to take the time to go to Permafrost.<br/>
With the exception of the shin greaves and the fiery vambraces, I acquired<br/>
every component by killing the mobs that drop them.  The groups I was in<br/>
certainly helped me along the way.  In many occasions, there were 30+ level<br/>
people in the group but they were low enough in level so that I got<br/>
experience everytime we killed a mob.  IMO, that means that I earned it<br/>
versus someone giving it to me.  For the shin greaves and fiery vambraces,<br/>
the person who killed the mob was giving them away for free so I took<br/>
advantage of their generosity.  <br/>
<br/>
In total I have acquired ten of the quest components.  However, I only have<br/>
one piece of lambent armor.  Now I have to focus on saving up some money so<br/>
I can buy the gem components.  By the time I have enough money to buy the<br/>
gems for the quest components I already have, I will probably be high enough<br/>
level to try and get the ones I&#39;m missing.  Acquiring all the lambent armor<br/>
pieces is a long term goal I have for my character.  I will enjoy it<br/>
everytime I get a new piece because I know that I will have earned it.  In<br/>
philosophical terms, I will enjoy the journey just as much as I will enjoy<br/>
arriving at the destination. <br/>
<br/>
Now for the opinion part.  The process I just described is what works for<br/>
me.  I personally could care less what anyone else thinks about it (thats<br/>
the beauty of opinions).  How you want to go about getting your lambent<br/>
armor is up to you.  Because of Verant&#39;s design decisions for EQ, there<br/>
isn&#39;t any right or wrong way to go about it.  If your a 10th level bard and<br/>
can figure out a way to loot a basalt carapace, you earned it, IMO:-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; equipment you can obtain.  We&#39;ve got a bunch of people who<br/>
&gt; &gt; like to play the work-for-everything-you-get game, and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bunch of people who like to play the monty-haul-start-off-<br/>
&gt; &gt; with-the-best-of-everything game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For me it&#39;s not that black and white. I would say I&#39;m in the middle on the<br/>
&gt; whole &quot;monte-hall&quot; &quot;get it myself&quot; debate - I&#39;m not really in either camp;<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t mind when people give me things, but it&#39;s also fun to get them for<br/>
&gt; myself (as I stated before, I plan on getting the Lambent myself). BUT I<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; not begrudge others getting Lambent WHEN they do even IF they had help and<br/>
&gt; are not at a level where they can get it themselves (not to say that they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need a towel as I drool on their armor when I see these people). For<br/>
&gt; various reasons, the obvious being the impossibility of self-acquirement,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; will be waiting to get it, even though my guild would probably help me get<br/>
&gt; it if I asked (they&#39;re a fun and helpful bunch).<br/>
