<div id="ygrps-yiv-430000083">this happened to a bard friend this weekend , he is a lvl 37 bard , a high<br/>
40&#39;s warrior friend , that he had known since very early levels , did this<br/>
to him ,<br/>
<br/>
the guy thinks he did it because the warrior is going to sell his account  ,<br/>
and the bard&#39;ss equipment thrown in might jack up the price ,<br/>
<br/>
My bud is a lvl 37 or 38 bard , all he was left with was a few items in the<br/>
bank for sale/trade , some lambent quest components , and a gnoll hide<br/>
lariat ,  He decided rather than start over collecting items to rebuild his<br/>
inventory , he gave his account to his best friend ,<br/>
<br/>
it seems as if you can&#39;t even trust your best friends nowadays , greed over<br/>
items , and the e-bay crap are ruining some ppl&#39;s gaming experience ,<br/>
<br/>
right now on Rallos , ppl make real world profit from their looted items<br/>
when pk&#39;ing ,<br/>

&gt; Ack, I am very sorry to hear your misfortune.<br/>
&gt; Now, this is the type of person I am but I would be really pissed right<br/>
&gt; now, you should report this person to a GM, I am sure something can be<br/>
done<br/>
&gt; because I remember reading a post on www.everquest.com about a guy who was<br/>
&gt; given consent, looted the corpse and then logged, he posted saying that<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; brother wanted to play, well anyway, the gm&#39;s banned his account, he then<br/>
&gt; logged onto his brother account and got that one banned, he then continued<br/>
&gt; to get another brothers account banned. The GM&#39;s also got the equipment<br/>
&gt; back for this unfortunate person who had it stolen from him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go report this person NOW. He deserves all he gets for being such an ass<br/>
&gt; hole.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, rant over. Goodluck, I hope you get your stuff back.<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well I just wanted to tell you a little tale so that you can all remember<br/>
&gt; not to make my mistakes.  Last night, I made the mistake of consenting<br/>
&gt; someone to drag Tani&#39;s corpse out of the Scryer room in Guk.  Well, long<br/>
&gt; story short, all my armor and weapons were stolen (punishment for<br/>
twinking,<br/>
&gt; heh) by this guy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are all sorts of complicating sidelines to this story which I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; spare<br/>
&gt; you.  Although I know it was always a risk, I just never thought someone<br/>
&gt; would be so mean and viscious.  The items are just items, but people that<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; that stuff just plain suck!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Guess I&#39;ll have to make a contest to see how much of my quest stuff I can<br/>
&gt; get back in one week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope you&#39;re all having a great day... and DON&#39;T CONSENT SOMEONE YOU DON&#39;T<br/>
&gt; KNOW!!!<br/>
&gt; (most of you have probably figured that out - guess I get to wear the<br/>
naive<br/>
&gt; banner for the week)<br/>
