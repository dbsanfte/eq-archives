<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277102380">Too bad I get the &quot;ding&quot; of death every 30 minutes or so ever since the<br/>
patch.  I almost NEVER crashed and since the patch, I can&#39;t even play the<br/>
game.  And yes, I do have the latest SB Live 3.0 drivers...<br/>

&gt; Oh yes..  Virtually every mob has a movement and idle sound of some sort.<br/>
&gt; The sounds effects in EQ are the best of any game I&#39;ve every played.<br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the one thing that I have *never* seen a complaint about in any forum.<br/>
&gt; There aren&#39;t any sounds that I can think of in the game that sound<br/>
&quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>
&gt; The next time you play, pay attention to some of the sounds and try to<br/>
&gt; imagine how they came up with them.  Ambient sounds, beetles, spiders<br/>
&gt; walking, snakes hissing, frogloks (splicka, splicka, splicka), Aviaks,<br/>
&gt; lizards in CT, giants, Spectres, Ghouls...  The sounds effects in EQ are a<br/>
&gt; work of art that surpass the graphics by a healthy margin imo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FYI: I&#39;m using Soundblaster Live!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I never had any idea.  Apparently bears grumble as they walk,<br/>
wolves<br/>
&gt; &gt; howl, giant beetles and spiders make funny chittering noises when<br/>
&gt; &gt; they walk?<br/>
&gt; &gt; I assume since no one has laughed and said I was insane that these<br/>
sounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; really occur.  I was floored the first time a groupmate asked why I<br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; hear a giant coming.  I had no clue what he meant.<br/>
