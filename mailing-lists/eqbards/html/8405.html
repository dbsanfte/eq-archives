<div id="ygrps-yiv-594379893">You need to go over to rathe mountains and charm kill HG&#39;s. <br/>
Charm one HG and tell it to attack another, then run away some using selo&#39;s <br/>
and when the charm breaks do it again. You can get a good amount of exp <br/>
fairly quickly this way. Of course since you are aparently new to bards, you <br/>
could also die a few times and lose even more exp. But this is at least one <br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to ya</div>
