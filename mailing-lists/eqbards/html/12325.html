<b>Subject:</b> Cazic Thule slain on Innoruuk. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-232200215">In a long, tedious 2 day struggle inside the PoF, CT was finally<br/>
  dropped on Innoruuk.  Had to ignore my girlfriend for hours on<br/>
  end, so now I owe her big time. ;)  CT would have dropped sooner,<br/>
  but we tried all this during times where most people had to sleep<br/>
  or go to work the next day.  Thus, during the nighttime a small<br/>
  group of people held the plane clear until others would arrive<br/>
  after naps/work.  The combined efforts of 5 or 6 guilds paid off<br/>
  around 10:00pm ET yesterday when the plane was finally cleared.<br/>
  At 10:30pm ET Cazic Thule was dead.<br/>
<br/>
  Two days in the PoF teaches you a whole lot.  More than one short<br/>
  12 hour burst, imo.  I logged 32 hours of the 48 it was held.  I<br/>
  know the zone like the back of my hand now, thanks to Solidarity<br/>
  of Vision and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
  24 people in the Cazic wave dropped him in less than 2 mins.<br/>
  While we were buffing up, 4 mobs spawned in the zone, and thus<br/>
  wave2 with 24 more people came to aid with the extras after the <br/>
  God fell.<br/>
<br/>
  GMs were present during the slaying.  First ever on Innoruuk.<br/>
<br/>
  I got the privledge of being in CT GR1, the primary and initial<br/>
  group which charged Cazic.  Only one member of my group perished,<br/>
  100% resisted Panic.  Verses of Victory and Mystical Shielding<br/>
  were played in battle.  Cazic Thule hit me once for 40 dmg and<br/>
  once for 171 dmg.  He never touched me again, although I was<br/>
  Gravity Fluxed about 3 times during the battle.  I did over 500<br/>
  combined dmg, including 2 yk procs.<br/>
<br/>
  I think I died about 6 times on the whole trip.  Two of those<br/>
  times, I really couldn&#39;t do anything to help it if you get my<br/>
  meaning.<br/>
<br/>
  To be honest, we bent him over hard.  He didnt stand a chance.<br/>
  Since I was the only bard there for 90% of the time, and since<br/>
  I did breakin, I am now carrying the Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccalo.<br/>
  Yeah it&#39;s useless, but it&#39;s God loot.  And the only one on this<br/>
  server too ;)<br/>
<br/>
  Since there was nothing else for a bard on the plane, a lot of<br/>
  people owe me hateplane trips now ;)  And I&#39;ve already gotten<br/>
  2 invites to go during the next week.  More imbrued here I come ;)<br/>
