<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130989555">Lets see, at one point I had...<br/>
Blackened Iron Crown<br/>
Lambent BP<br/>
Barbed arm plates<br/>
Bronze bracers<br/>
Lambent gloves<br/>
Shin greaves<br/>
Bronze boots<br/>
<br/>
So all total that is a wood elf with black head, blue chest, gray arms,<br/>
orange wrists, blue gloves, silver pants and orange feet..... very very<br/>
very bad.  It was a nightmare.  I cleaned up my act though and look much<br/>
better now.<br/>

&gt;My other stuff includes:<br/>

&gt;lambent legs<br/>
&gt;lambent arms.. add in the blue<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well last night i topped off my ugly look by replacing my lambent bracer for<br/>
&gt;a Kylong Wrist guard (same stats but more charisma).  THE BRACER IS BROWNISH<br/>
&gt;RED!!  i freaked out when i saw it, it keeps overwriting my hero bracer<br/>
&gt;look. I never though i could look worse but oh boy when i put that on did i<br/>
&gt;ever freak. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While i&#39;m auctioning, some twink bard in full lambent at lev 12 pops up to<br/>
&gt;me asks me what i wanted for my hero bracer (im auctioning it because i have<br/>
&gt;a spare)  then after a wee bit says oh nm, i thought you were a twink and<br/>
&gt;not a real player.  Talk about kicking me while im down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sooo anyways, that kicked me in the butt severely and now im really<br/>
&gt;determined to powerlevel instead of grouping (which i would much rather do).<br/>
&gt;I have to kiss my lambent and tree weave goodbye soon and get some imbrued,<br/>
&gt;im tired of looking like all the twinks with various ss and lambent.  Dont<br/>
&gt;get me wrong, i have nothing against twinking but man im sick of passing for<br/>
&gt;something that is 20-30 levels lower then i really am.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Arg sorry for the rant<br/>
