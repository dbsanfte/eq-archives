<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074247080">Question for anyone here who can successfully stack 3 or 4 songs in crowded<br/>
zones:<br/>
<br/>
What are you using for hardware? (processor, ram, video ram, free<br/>
DASD/virtual mem - whichever is smaller, modem, typical connect speed,<br/>
anything else I may be forgetting)  I know I could use a bit of a hardware<br/>
upgrade, just wondering how little I can get away with. Also, what in-game<br/>
sacrifices have you made in the options to be able to weave/mix/twist so<br/>
successfully?<br/>
<br/>
FYI I&#39;m using P200 MMX, 64ram, 16 video, 100 mg free all allocated to<br/>
virtual memory, 64 winmodem that usually connects at 44.  I forgot to write<br/>
down my option settings, but I know I&#39;ve got single layer sky & sound<br/>
realism all the way up.  The rest I&#39;d have to check when I get home.<br/>
<br/>
Note: this is not to restart a debate on modems or anything else.  Please<br/>
think of it as a survey & don&#39;t pounce on anyone who handles the game<br/>
differently from you.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance to any who help.<br/>
