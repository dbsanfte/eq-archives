<div id="ygrps-yiv-227082139">You&#39;ve taken what I said out of context.  The issue was the GM driven &quot;Test<br/>
of&quot; events going on.  Apparently the only people who can win the events are<br/>
the level 50+ folks.  Kitasi and I were both agreeing that GM events should<br/>
be geared towards a specific level range.  For example, if there is a GM<br/>
event in GFay, which is a low level zone, then the only people eligible to<br/>
participate and receive any potential reward are those people in the level<br/>
range the zone was designed for.  But Verant doesn&#39;t do this.  If they hold<br/>
an event in GFay the entire zone will be full of level 50s trying to kill<br/>
the GM controlled mobs.<br/>
<br/>
In a perfect world GM events would be focused on roleplaying and not killing<br/>
the GM controlled mobs.  To my knowledge this has only happened once on E&#39;ci<br/>
(Chula the cleric got the Butcherblock Hammer (artifact) as a reward when<br/>
the GMs voted he roleplayed better than anyone else participating).<br/>
<br/>
IMO, the only proper way to &quot;Test&quot; a bard is to judge him/her on their<br/>
storytelling and/or roleplaying capability.  At 50+ level almost every bard<br/>
will have similar equipment, similar skills, and the same songs.  Stats<br/>
don&#39;t mean much so there isn&#39;t much to differentiate us with another bard<br/>
except our weaving skills and roleplaying ability.  I&#39;m only 37th level but<br/>
am fairly confident I know more about playing a bard than some of the 50+<br/>
bards on my server.  I can safely say this because I&#39;ve been subscribing to<br/>
this list for over a year.  There are a lot of 50+ bards that never read<br/>
this list or the Concert Hall board.  I try to roleplay as much as possible.<br/>
But as it stands right now, even though I know my class like the back of my<br/>
hand, I can&#39;t compete on my server for this Test because I&#39;m not high enough<br/>
level.  Thats what I don&#39;t agree with.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  do you disagree with the statement that<br/>
if you spend more time in the game you should have better items and attain<br/>
higher levels?  True casual gamers aren&#39;t concerned that much with items<br/>
and levels.  the only people upset by this statement are the power gamers<br/>
who don&#39;t have time to put into the game.<br/>
