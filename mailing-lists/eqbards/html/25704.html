<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-419288051">I&#39;d recommend starting to look into the Nestrolo Tambourine coin quest.  At<br/>
30 you may be a tad low - but you can start (and if the bard is a second<br/>
character - while the drum is no-drop the coins aren&#39;t) - so you can collect<br/>
the coin on the other char - and complete the quest on your bard.  A lot of<br/>
people ask a lot of money for MM drums - so you can avoid that cost by doing<br/>
the coin quest which is a tad time consuming but doesn&#39;t cost much money.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the DE mask - note that the advantage of not being KOS only works<br/>
if you are agnostic.  Mobs in EQ can tell your &quot;God&quot; so if you chose one -<br/>
you&#39;ll probably still be KOS regardless of the mast.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless - it&#39;s a very good item to wear - and the illusion is fun - and<br/>
the ultravision can be helpful.<br/>
