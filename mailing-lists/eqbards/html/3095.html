<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546388664">If I&#39;m in an area where I expect trouble that I know we can&#39;t handle, like<br/>
Proon for instance when we&#39;re already involved, or Kizdean out in W<br/>
Commonlands, I often switch camera views by hitting F9 4 times.  Then you<br/>
can use alt-l or rt arrow to circle around the fight and keep a goo d eye on<br/>
most of the surrounding area without hitting any keys.  One tap of F9 and<br/>
you&#39;re back to first person.  Not my favorite way, but since flipping your<br/>
head around to look around you is so easy in real life, why shouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
so in the &#39;unreal&#39; world too.<br/>

&gt; Now, what I do consider twitch elements are mouselook, and<br/>
&gt; not being able to map strafing to individual keys instead<br/>
&gt; of Ctrl + turn keys, because I&#39;ve never had the hand-eye<br/>
&gt; to master mouselook+keyboard to circle strafe a mob and<br/>
&gt; keep a lookout around me during a fight, or just to get<br/>
&gt; behind it while it is focused on a group mate.  My wish<br/>
&gt; list for the interface includes<br/>
<br/>
You need to map your movement keys to the left side of the<br/>
keyboard.  If you hold down the right mouse button (go into<br/>
mouselook mode), the left/right keys will strafe you instead<br/>
of turn you.  Once you figure this out, it&#39;s pretty trivial to<br/>
circle a mob while facing him to keep a lookout around you.<br/>
Do be careful not to do it too much, as I&#39;ve heard your chance<br/>
to land a blow decreases if you&#39;ve moved that &quot;round.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(&quot;Strafe&quot; incidently is a gamer&#39;s term, the simulation<br/>
industry calls straight translation motion &quot;slewing.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2.  Glance Left/Right keys.  I.E.  while you&#39;re holding the Glance left<br/>
&gt;      key down, your pov pivots 30degrees to the left, but your movement<br/>
&gt;      direction doesn&#39;t change.  Make this available in 1st person POV and<br/>
&gt;      the from the back 3rd person POV.<br/>
<br/>
About the only time I&#39;d like this is when running as a group.<br/>
Otherwise it&#39;s too easy to just turn with the mouse.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I *would* like is to be able to switch mouselook<br/>
from right mouse button down, to right mouse button toggle.<br/>
Sometimes it gets tiring holding that button down for several<br/>
minutes.<br/>
