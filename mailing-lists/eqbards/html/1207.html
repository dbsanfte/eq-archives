<div id="ygrps-yiv-322271929"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;2 cp)I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Norrath, Karma or the Gods, but I crash about a<br/>
&gt;third of the time when dealing with Fae Drakes. Sometimes during combat,<br/>
&gt;sometimes after a kill, sometimes if they&#39;re just on my screen! No other<br/>
&gt;creature has had this effect on me. Has anyone else seen this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This happens on the eight older machines in our lab.  We think it&#39;s a video <br/>
card problem.  It happens when a bat, a fae drake, or a gargoyle is on your <br/>
screen.  Everything completely locks up, and we have to reboot the machine.<br/>
<br/>
When we got some other machines that didn&#39;t have this problem, one of our <br/>
players went on a rampage slaughtering every fae drake he could find (he <br/>
was high enough level that they were all green to him) as revenge for the <br/>
number of times they had locked up his machine.<br/>
