<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133945114">Hail bards:<br/>
<br/>
[OOC: This is the last time I will clarify questions on the EQBards forum.<br/>
If you have individual issues with The Soerbaird, please mail me<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rvarnell@...">rvarnell@...</a>) and I will answer your questions on that basis. I<br/>
do not wish to monopolize the general discussion of bardic issues with talk<br/>
of our guild. We have forums on our guild site where we can do that! I<br/>
apologize for the long thread of discussion here, but I will not let our<br/>
guild be disparaged without an answer.]<br/>
<br/>
You are all expressing excellent questions and concerns. Let me see if I<br/>
can address them. Before I answer the questions, though, let me preface by<br/>
saying that The Soerbaird isn&#39;t a guild for everyone. There are many, many<br/>
guilds in Norrath that accept any applicant from any class, race, or<br/>
belief. If you&#39;re seeking to be in a guild just for the sake of being in a<br/>
guild, don&#39;t apply to The Soerbaird. <br/>
<br/>
We are a working guild of bards. Soerbaird are expected to compose and<br/>
record, performing true bardic duties of writing ballads and recording<br/>
history. We are not banded together to help you achieve your 20th rank, nor<br/>
are we here to fit you with armor and magical items. We do help each other,<br/>
and reward excellent performance, but our goal is NOT to suit each of our<br/>
members in plate mail. <br/>
<br/>
That said, let me address some of your concerns:<br/>
<br/>
ON SERVERS...<br/>
Our primary presence is on Fennin Ro, but we do have bards on other<br/>
servers. The reason our charter is not specific about servers is we are<br/>
still trying to understand the best way to proceed. I would like at least<br/>
one bard on each server who could attend and record events that occur<br/>
there. Ideally, I would like a full branch on each server, but that will<br/>
take some time. One problem we face with other servers, though, is that we<br/>
cannot provide any member benefits there. <br/>
<br/>
ON TUITION and STARTING LATER...<br/>
Each Soerbaird is expected to pay the tuition, regardless of the age you<br/>
start. And no, if you missed the benefits for the younger students, we will<br/>
not reduce your tuition. We will, however, try and find some meaningful way<br/>
to celebrate your entrance into the organization, but it will be on a case<br/>
by case basis, and will be based on your merit as a bard, judged by your<br/>
work and character.<br/>
<br/>
ON THE ACADEMY...<br/>
Please note that acceptance into the Soerbaird Academy is not acceptance<br/>
into the guild. We have nine requirements that all students must meet in<br/>
order to be given full status in the Soerbaird. While acceptance into the<br/>
student body is rather easy, it takes time to earn the title of Soerbaird.<br/>
If you show during your time as a student that you do not have the<br/>
character or bearing we seek, then you will be respectfully removed from<br/>
the Academy, and your tuition will be reimbursed.<br/>
<br/>
ON AGNOSTICISM...<br/>
Unfortunately, agnosticism is a very poor term for what the Soerbaird<br/>
believe. We are pantheistic, rather, seeking to respect no god above any<br/>
other. Our intent is to stay as neutral as possible in the politics of the<br/>
land, so we may act well in our capacity as historians and mediators. With<br/>
devotion to a single god comes the expectation that you have to serve that<br/>
god&#39;s needs above any other. While we respect you for that belief, it does<br/>
not embody what a Soerbaird. <br/>
<br/>
That said, many in their youth pledge quickly to a deity, not understanding<br/>
full well what that costs them. Understanding that, I will not exclude any<br/>
who made such a pledge IF they will take an oath upon entering the<br/>
Soerbaird that they will respect all gods in their work as a bard,<br/>
reporting and recording truthfully and without bias what they see. However,<br/>
bards pledged as such cannot be a part of our Brehon Filidh, who will be<br/>
expected to be absolutely politically neutral.<br/>
<br/>
ON PATRONS...<br/>
Many young bards have a benefactor, or &#39;investor&#39; if you will, who seeks to<br/>
further their talent by providing the funds to enter our Academy. So, one<br/>
way to alleviate the hefty tuition, is to find a wealthy friend who would<br/>
sponsor you to the Academy. We feel this creates a unique and meaningful<br/>
relationship, and also encourages students to graduate more rapidly because<br/>
a third party has a vested interest in their success. Also, sometimes,<br/>
another guild might wish to sponsor a bard to our academy, with that bard<br/>
eventually becoming a Soerbaird Affiliate--still a member of the sponsoring<br/>
guild, but able to share and contribute to our collective work. The patron<br/>
is not a requirement, and I see now how that can be a bit confusing from<br/>
our application page. I&#39;ll clarify that a bit more there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you all for your questions and discussion. If you have further<br/>
questions, find me on Fennin Ro, or visit our Annals and leave a message on<br/>
our forum there.<br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live!<br/>
