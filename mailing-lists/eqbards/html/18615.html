<div id="ygrps-yiv-82634810">hehehe trust me, try it with the lute, ditch your sword for awhile and have<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
Anything you can kill with HoR, CoD and JWW with weapons you can slaughter<br/>
with a lute instead.<br/>
<br/>
You will do roughly 3x as much dmg with CoD using an instrument and it&#39;s a<br/>
&#39;never miss&#39; kind of dmg so you will do more dmg than you would with<br/>
weapons.  Especially after adding in the extra dammage you do from punching.<br/>
The Warsong speeds you up the same (about 25%) so you will still swing<br/>
roughly the same speed, figure 50% of weapon dmg (depending on what you&#39;re<br/>
using, could be as low as 25%).  The Hymn, with a Lute is VASTLY more<br/>
efficient.  Almost completely negating dmg you take from 1 creature at that<br/>
level.  Even at 20th with a lute I could take 2, and sometimes 3, blue/white<br/>
and even yellow con mobs at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Try it out, all instrument is really the way to go when solo or in a 2<br/>
person group.  3 or more I tend to break out weapons depending on group<br/>
makeup.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; The characters were a joke since the GM&#39;s made us delete the<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The characters were a joke?  Oh, you mean they were rogues.  ;^)  Fitting,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; suppose.  You could always claim you were roleplaying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; WOW and I thought that my best friend spent a lot of time<br/>
&gt; &gt; roleplaying with<br/>
&gt; &gt; 44days played at 20th...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ahah!  A challenge!  (Actually the challenge will be to get to 20 before<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; wide world of EQ comes crashing down due to all it&#39;s players movign on to<br/>
&gt; other games)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  hehe and she spends HOURS just<br/>
&gt; &gt; frittering time away<br/>
&gt; &gt; talking to folks ;)  She loves the social aspect of the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I keep trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to tell her this isn&#39;t MiRC but she loves to chat :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My game time is spent mostly fishing, drinking, delivering mail, and<br/>
&gt; retrieving corpses - sometimes not even my own!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kudos on 11th!  Have you tried the all-instrument twist of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hymn/Disonnance/Warsong?  (punching of course)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks.  And no, but I did dust off Disonnance for the first time in ages<br/>
&gt; last night.  I hadn&#39;t used since, oh, level 4, except as an initial taunt<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; get a mobs attention.  But last night I found a nice open area (WC, near<br/>
EC)<br/>
&gt; and a mob I knew I could take (giant spider) and tried the ol&#39; wince tune<br/>
&gt; for laughs.  I am TOTALLY sold on the HoR/CoD/JWW medley now.  I&#39;d have<br/>
&gt; tried it with the lute except I couldn&#39;t rightly tell how much damage CoD<br/>
&gt; was doing.<br/>
