any one of them.  Six of us killed a musician when we were<br/>
L25-30, and though it was a tough fight, we were never in any<br/>
real danger of losing.<br/>

The problem is getting just one.<br/>

that could.  The only things I&#39;ve met there that see through<br/>
invis are the undead - the scantily clad white-skinned females<br/>
with the bad backs (hunched over), and the well dressed<br/>
white-skinned males.  I think they&#39;re supposed to be vampires.<br/>
