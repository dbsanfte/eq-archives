<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-688576129">Only problem is I don&#39;t have Clarity, or Psalm of Cooling, or Dennon&#39;s<br/>
Dissention. <br/>
<br/>
That would leave me twisting Chant of Battle and Hymn with resists and the<br/>
odd Pixie Strike.  <br/>
<br/>
There is absolutely zero chance of using Lament, how could that possible<br/>
help the Enchanter not get attacked?  Did you mean Lullaby?  I&#39;d never try<br/>
that as it gets resisted 60%+ on yellows and up and it would break any<br/>
mezzed critters that didn&#39;t resist in 6 seconds.  I use Siren&#39;s if I need to<br/>
get something off the Enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
My weapon damage is laughable.  Even with a Harpoon of the Depths and an<br/>
Obsidian Shard, with the low taunt songs I&#39;m twisting, a ranger 5 levels<br/>
below me got the mobs attention twice as much as I did.  The only times I<br/>
was the target of choice was when I pulled or had to charm a mob off<br/>
someone.  Even with our high taunt factor, the songs I was singing weren&#39;t<br/>
effective enough to warrant more attention from the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure when I have manasong I&#39;ll have another option for twisting but<br/>
without being able to use my hard hitting songs I won&#39;t be an offensive<br/>
force when the &#39;chanter is around until I have three Chants.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not in my nature to be solely a defensive presence, and I&#39;m not sure I<br/>
have the tools to do that job anyhow except vs. casters.  <br/>
<br/>
What are good defensive tools against melee mobs?  The Damage shields seem<br/>
weak considering we are fighting 1 mob 90% of the time.<br/>

Weapons:<br/>
I put away the Blade of Fiery Lamentations and break out the  Staff of<br/>
Writhing, with the Obsidian Shard I am now AE free on weapons and still<br/>
kicking butt.<br/>
<br/>
Songs:<br/>
<br/>
In combat (assuming the Enchanter knows their job and keeps the haste buffs<br/>
coming) I sing Psalm of Cooling, Clarity and Chant of Battle in combat. I<br/>
have Lament ready in case the Enchanter mezzes a large pull, I do this<br/>
because if I don&#39;t and the mezz breaks the mobs are all over him/her. Lament<br/>
gives the enchanter a chance the mobs will agro on me, and I can survive<br/>
that better.<br/>
<br/>
I also have Resist buffs and pixie strike ready for an unplanned caster-mob<br/>
emergency.<br/>
<br/>
If the enchanter gets the casters mezzed I switch to horn and play Dennons<br/>
Dissention to drain them while they wait.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of ways to play nice with an enchanter, frankly I love<br/>
grouping with them. And any other casters love it too, Clarity and Clarity<br/>
song is a beautiful thing.<br/>
<br/>
Tszaaz<br/>
<br/>
(Hymn is the other song of course. There are some changes for outdoor as I<br/>
need selos, however, if there is a Shaman I just get a SoW and use the slot<br/>
for something else)<br/>
