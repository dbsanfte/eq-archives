&gt;Genni is definately in the temple, I don&#39;t remember the location, but I was<br/>
&gt;able to deal with him.  He&#39;s in a seperate location from the bards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*Gasp*, I&#39;m just another bard!? :P  Yeah I&#39;ve gotten the helm, and have<br/>
exactly half of every other quest (blah).  Myself and a Wizard ran around<br/>
getting all those pieces, unfortunatly now I need a group for the rest, and<br/>
as I&#39;m sure you know, no one is horribly excited about doing SolA.  I&#39;ll<br/>
probably try for the boots and vambraces next.  Lambent stones continue to<br/>
be the thorn in my side.  I just did the helm quest the other night and<br/>
Genni worked fine, might only be a server specific problem.  Genni is<br/>
located (from the main bard quest NPC&#39;s), up the ramp in the center, through<br/>
the door, take a right and go through I think 3 doors or so, she is there<br/>
with one other NPC.<br/>
