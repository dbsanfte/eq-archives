<div id="ygrps-yiv-208464690">Wow, that&#39;s exactly the opposite of what we saw.  He died when barely 31 and<br/>
was down about a quarter bubble in 30.  When he died when barely 30 he<br/>
couldn&#39;t see any missing xp at 29 and one kill dinged him back to 30.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a similar thing at 20th.  I died with a sliver at 21st and fell back<br/>
into 20th by about a quarter bubble.  Strangely, when I died with about 2<br/>
slivers into 21, and definitely less than a quarter bubble, I didn&#39;t even<br/>
lose the level.  Seems that different logic mandates how much xp you lose<br/>
when you die and lose a level.  Its almost like you lose xp, go down a level<br/>
and the logic says, hmmm died reduce xp a second time.  I saw this several<br/>
times from 15 to 16 where dying with almost a quarter bubble into 16 dropped<br/>
me to 15, but dying at 15 barely moved the bar.  Then dying at 16 with half<br/>
a bubble also showed the bar barely moving.<br/>
<br/>
All very strange.  Although according to the druid I mentioned&#39;s notes from<br/>
35th and 36th.  He killed the exact same critters give or take their level<br/>
variance, at both 35th and 36th.  You&#39;d expect that he would kill fewer at<br/>
35th gain 36th, than at 36th to gain 37th, but it was the other way around.<br/>
And not particularly close either.  From what I recall he killed almost 20%<br/>
more critters going from 35th to 36th than he did going from 36th to 37th,<br/>
and the list of kills was only different by 2 mobs I think.  Have to<br/>
remember to bug him for the lists so I can look into it in more detail.<br/>

Oh, btw, you DO lose more exp in hell levels + 1.  It&#39;s not<br/>
the same exp loss appearing larger because HL+1 requires less<br/>
exp.  I died *immediately* after I got level 31, and lost over<br/>
a half bubble into 30.  I only lost about a quarter bubble<br/>
with other deaths at 30.<br/>
