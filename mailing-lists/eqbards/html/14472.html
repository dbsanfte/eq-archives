&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is actually a gripe of mine too with nearly all the RPGs<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen.  The way the rules work, the best strategy is for<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone to concentrate on one opponent at a time, while the<br/>
&gt; &gt; extras beat on you.  In real combat, that&#39;ll get you killed<br/>
&gt; &gt; real quick since the extras will be getting free shots at your<br/>
&gt; &gt; backside.  I&#39;d really like to see a CRPG with some sort of<br/>
&gt; &gt; engagement/disengagement system.  Then the warrior wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to taunt, he&#39;d just step between the cleric and mob and<br/>
&gt; &gt; engage the mob in combat.  If the mob turned to attack the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric, the warrior would get a free shot in for max or<br/>
&gt; &gt; critical damage.  Yes this would require mobs to have better<br/>
&gt; &gt; AI, which IMHO is always a good thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that for entertainment&#39;s sake, we wouldn&#39;t really want it. I see the<br/>
&gt; point you are making, which is that it would require more strategy if they<br/>
&gt; were to fight and take damage in a more realistic fashion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Potentially, if we wanted realism, 1 good stick in the gut should disable<br/>
&gt; any mob or player then, which kind of ruins any suspense.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just so you know, the RPG I played most (and type of system I<br/>
like the most) was Traveller.  Yes, one good stick in the gut<br/>
could disable just about anyone.  Yes Muhammad Ali could be<br/>
knocked out by one weakling swinging a pipe at his head from<br/>
behind.  Yes it changes combat tactics - rather than what you<br/>
do in a fight being important (which I always thought should<br/>
be based on the character&#39;s skill, not the player&#39;s ability to<br/>
play), how you plan a fight and how well you carry out that<br/>
plan, and how you adapt to changing circumstances becomes<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t picked it up yet from my other comments:<br/>
<br/>
- I don&#39;t like level based systems<br/>
- I don&#39;t like class based systems<br/>
- I don&#39;t like increasing hp systems<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, all of these are quick-and-easy approaches to &quot;solving&quot;<br/>
the playbalance problem by artificially imposing limitations<br/>
to enforce orthogonality (balancing a game is much easier if<br/>
the factors you can tweak are all orthogonal).  The tradeoff<br/>
of course is that you lose flexibility and diversity, and you<br/>
get some really strange things happening in the game world<br/>
physics (e.g. high level people without safe fall surviving<br/>
impossible drops).<br/>
