<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664435995">Actually, the more I think about it, the more I think this would actually <br/>
be very handy.  Never having used it, I don&#39;t know the duration of Eye of <br/>
Zomm, but if it lasts long enough, then follow these steps:<br/>
1) Turn on song.<br/>
2) Summon Eye<br/>
3) Put Eye directly in front of you, facing directly away.<br/>
4) Move Eye in a straight line...<br/>
<br/>
It might not be so useful in tree-infested areas, though.<br/>

&gt; &gt;What about if you have a SS helm and summon the Eye of Zomm?  Can you summon<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Eye, turn on the corpse locating song, and then lead the person to their<br/>
&gt; &gt;corpse with the Eye instead of going yourself?  This could be useful in<br/>
&gt; &gt;situations when you don&#39;t want to leave your party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Neat idea. I&#39;d guess that this wouldn&#39;t work, but who knows. Any idea what<br/>
&gt;the duration is of Eye of Zomm from the helm? I know my magician&#39;s Eye of<br/>
&gt;Zomm has a very short duration. Not sure it&#39;d stay around long enough to<br/>
&gt;help someone locate their corpse.<br/>
