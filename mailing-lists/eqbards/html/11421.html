 </span></blockquote>You can drag stuff out of lava anywhere else in Sol A (you may<br/>
have to get creative with your levitate, but you can do it).  <br/>
It&#39;s just the section past that lavafall where you can&#39;t pull<br/>
it out.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava pool into Sol-b?<br/>
&gt; Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would end up in Lava<br/>
&gt; if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?  Like someone could zone out of sol-b<br/>
&gt; in panic and die in the lava?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That particular zone point goes from lava to lava.  I spent<br/>
the better part of an hour (my first hour ever in Sol B mind<br/>
you) finding a friend&#39;s corpse after he fell in in Sol A,<br/>
zoned through to Sol B, and died.  We had no idea where in<br/>
that lava zone came out in Sol B, and I had to rely on the<br/>
song to figure out where his corpse was.  (I was not attacked<br/>
the entire time, and figured Sol B wasn&#39;t so bad so decided to<br/>
play there a bit, and problem died to a sonic bat train. :-)<br/>
