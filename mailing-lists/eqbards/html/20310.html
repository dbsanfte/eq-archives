<div id="ygrps-yiv-831018850"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How often do you actually use the mouse while playing a bard? <br/>
&gt;  I mean other<br/>
&gt; than swapping instruments, as that is a very short distance <br/>
&gt; for a mouse to<br/>
&gt; travel and even a lagging mouse can hack it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, erm, I always have a hand on the mouse unless I am saying something. I<br/>
use it to look/navigate (rclick) and target(lclick). All my hotkeys and<br/>
macros forward/backward/strafe are triggered with my left hand. And<br/>
instrument/weapon swapping of course, which I do a LOT. A gunky mouse when<br/>
you are switching from weapons to drum with less than a bub of health can<br/>
mean death! :o)<br/>
