<div id="ygrps-yiv-498045509">Actually, you just struck upon an important point.  The last 3 stones that I<br/>
have bought were NOT from the person that killed the HG/SG/Griffon or<br/>
whatever, but instead by some wanderer that happen to see an unlooted<br/>
corpse.<br/>
<br/>
These things are being left to rot because you can only have one at a time<br/>
and they just aren&#39;t worth the time to sell them before killing your next<br/>
HG/SG/Griffon etc.<br/>

&gt; Good grief - I&#39;d expect this type of answer (generically) from a wizard,<br/>
&gt; but not a bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is the ONLY thing you look at your profit margin? I am first and<br/>
&gt; foremost a<br/>
&gt; merchant - but jeeze, I spend a LOT of time makin things that folks NEED -<br/>
&gt; sometimes even at a personal loss.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you consider it a waste of time to help someone - with the ONE item you<br/>
&gt; know is required in abundance for an armor quest - well, what can<br/>
&gt; I say. If<br/>
&gt; you wanna be nice - give them away - if you wanna make them work some for<br/>
&gt; it, charge them a modest amount. Hell, I can make wu&#39;s gaunlets (barely)<br/>
&gt; now - but I still make patchwork if someone needs it. Am I supposed to<br/>
&gt; charge an arm and leg for it because 2-5g a pop is peanuts for me now?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whether I am lvl 1, 25 or 50 - I do share the world with others. My<br/>
&gt; personal passion happens to be getting joy from helping others with their<br/>
&gt; needs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This really isn&#39;t meant to be a flame - but it struck me odd that you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; think you were &#39;wasting&#39; your time.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes you may get the occasional butthead with money to burn who<br/>
&gt; will throw<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 100pp+, but I think these people are few and far between-hang<br/>
&gt; in there, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; make friends.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t think its fair at all to call someone a butthead because they can<br/>
&gt; &gt;pay more for items.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Pay what you want, lambent stones sell for 3pp in the shop.  It is<br/>
&gt; &gt;a major waste of my wizard&#39;s time to sell these for 10-20pp to people,<br/>
&gt; &gt;when the average HG drops 30pp, why waste 10 minutes moving through zones<br/>
&gt; &gt;trying to sell for only 7-17pp gain, I could just kill another HG.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You have to remember, people that are looting lambent stones are usually<br/>
&gt; &gt;level 30-45, and most of them don&#39;t consider it worth their time<br/>
&gt; &gt;to sell an item to a player for 20pp.<br/>
