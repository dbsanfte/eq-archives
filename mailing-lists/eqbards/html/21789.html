<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-913684976">Ok, maybe you just haven&#39;t read prior posts by Abashi on some of these<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Drums look like flutes when equipped. Strumming a flute looks quite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>silly<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - We may at some point look into creating another drum<br/>
model, but it&#39;s not a high priority at the moment as it&#39;s not a functional<br/>
issue.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Although not the answer I would have liked, it&#39;s a HELL of a lot more of an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>answer ?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;than we have EVER gotten on that issue.  At least now we can put that on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the back &gt;burner.<br/>
<br/>
This is the same answer they gave last November, said maybe after Kunark.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Brahm&#39;s Horn has no graphics when equipped. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[Wrinn, Gordon] - Fixed in the database. Next item patch.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Fixed.  No arguemnets there.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a big deal, believe it when I see it though since this is the second<br/>
time they said next item patch.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Raw bamboo (wind instrument) has no wind animation - should be same as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
flute. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - I don&#39;t believe that raw bamboo qualifies as a wind<br/>
instrument. We&#39;ll see for certain in the next patch. The original<br/>
implementation was meant to be a component for instrument construction.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Considering VI&#39;s track record, it&#39;ll probably just stay as a Wind<br/>
 </span></blockquote>instrument ;)<br/>
I&#39;d say more likely it will NOT function as a wind instrument as of next<br/>
patch.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Female bards cannot dance. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[Wrinn, Gordon] - Shared animations don&#39;t translate from the parent<br/>
character due to side of the model. We&#39;ll see about addressing this at some<br/>
point in the future, but as with the drum issue, it&#39;s not a high<br/>
priority.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As I personally have seen many female bards post how they DON&#39;T want to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dance, I think &gt;this is more of a taste issue.  Personally I would like to<br/>
see a toggle switch for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;animations.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t really care on this one either, a toggle would be nice.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* [Non bug, but annoying] Bard &#39;waddles&#39; when running. Why this animation<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was changed from the glide effect is odd since the bard was strumming a<br/>
flute. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Working as intended. This is the animation that is used,<br/>
and though I understand that there are some that do not like the animation,<br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be prudent to revisit it when time can be spent on more fruitful<br/>
pursuits. There were people complaining about the &quot;glide&quot; at one point which<br/>
is why a &quot;running while playing&quot; animation was put in.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As pointed out here and on the Concert Hall boards, it seems that with the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>last patch <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the &quot;waddle&quot; has been even&#39;d out.  But really... how much of a playability<br/>
 </span></blockquote>issue is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;this?  (I miss the glide myself, but I can live with the current waddle)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Haven&#39;t noticed much change myself.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Mask of Songbird - Plane of Sky item weighs 5.0. Obvious typo. ALL<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other<br/>
POS masks for all other classes weigh 0.5 or less. Not sure if this has been<br/>
fixed yet. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - Just had this fixed in the database.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Fixed.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool, doesn&#39;t affect many people, but cool nonetheless.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Small Brass Trumpet/Practice Lute  - item listed in patch message over<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a year ago. No one<br/>
has ever found item -ever. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It&#39;s not in game. There are no specific plans for it in<br/>
game. Our apologies for listing it previously.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yeah, those are a complete screw-job.  At least we now know they aren&#39;t in,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but why <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the hell they said they were in the first place are beyond me.  /rude<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Verant.<br/>
What else can I say, throws 90% of their credibility right out the window.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Both Lizardman Scout Fife or Froglok Escort Fife are unusable as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>instruments. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- They aren&#39;t meant to be usable as instruments.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For me, that&#39;s not really a problem (although I do think it&#39;s a bit silly<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for them not <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to be Wind instruments)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord (24)/Psalm of Warmth (25)/Psalms of Cooling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(33)/Psalms of Purity (37) <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Fixed in next client. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;More fixed things :o)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They said they fixed this 4 patches ago.  And again 3 patches ago.  Again<br/>
I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens (27)/Solon&#39;s Bewitching Bravura (39) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Can&#39;t reproduce any differences between the servers. In<br/>
any case, the charm spell is not designed to be refreshable, in any form. It<br/>
is currently working as intended.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If it works differently than it&#39;s supposed to on the PvP servers:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SHHHHHHHH!!!   ;o)  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think any answer to that one should be &quot;Oh yeah... you&#39;re right Gordon,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it DOESN&#39;T <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;work that way on PvP&quot;  (nudge, nudge, wink, wink)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t play a bard PvP so cannot tell if that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Psalms of Vitality (29) - Song was updated to do cure on pulse, but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>does<br/>
not seem to do so reliably. Many bards have seen message &quot;Your affliction<br/>
has been cured by a magical enchantment&quot; but the disease/poison icon still<br/>
present OR continue to lose hit points. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Todd tested this. The song works fine, but the success<br/>
message is being sent no matter what. The message is what&#39;s broken, not the<br/>
song.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;ll get fixed... eventually.  At least we now know the song itself works<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(although I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;have yet to try it)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So why do they still see the disease/poison icon and still take damage?  Far<br/>
as I can tell this akin to &quot;It&#39;s working&quot; when we know it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;*Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura (40) - Song appears to dispel magic, but the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bard receives no feedback message when used on mobs (e.g. &quot;MobX looks<br/>
dispelled&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Javier has fixed this in the database. Next spell update.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Fixed.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, this was just a message thing I think<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Jonthan&#39;s Provocation (45) (et al) - Song is a mix of Str+AC+ damage<br/>
 </span></blockquote>absorption<br/>
shield. If shield is used up, all other effects fail. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- All spells work this way. If one component of a spell is<br/>
used up, overwritten, resisted, or dispelled, all other components suffer<br/>
the same fate.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To me, this is just piss-poor coding.  This will be an issue that will come<br/>
 </span></blockquote>back time <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and again.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another stupid choice of putting spell effects together.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (15) - Song is essentially unusable due to 80%<br/>
 </span></blockquote>resist rates. Song also overrides higher-level enchanter mez spells. Bards<br/>
have done extensive testing of this song at all levels, charisma, and mob<br/>
levels and have found that: higher charisma increases resists and higher<br/>
level increases resists. GZ has stated song should have 35% resist rate, but<br/>
actual numbers are twice this (from what bards believe, bad coding in<br/>
secondary resist). VI has stated that song was tested and is working as<br/>
intended, but offers no proof of testing or what was actually tested.<br/>
Without this song, the only form of bard &quot;crowd control&quot; is charming or<br/>
single target mezzing (not that it works either). The amount of evidence of<br/>
this song not working is enormous and can all be found at Concert Hall site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- The resist rates cited are not correct for most<br/>
encounters. Though anecdotes on the next report resist rates in excess of<br/>
80% even with a level 60 bard versus a level 1 snake, we&#39;ve found that to be<br/>
incorrect. The spell has use at the lower levels, but as designed, it<br/>
becomes far less useful for higher level encounters. Works as intended.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One day...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, if we live that long.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Selo&#39;s Constant Chain (23) One of two songs unintentionally nerfed when<br/>
 </span></blockquote>54<br/>
song was changed. Song used to stop mobs in their tracks at 50% health,<br/>
since patch does not stop mob until down to 20%. Song also overrides higher<br/>
level snares of other classes. UPDATE: VI has decided that song was too<br/>
powerful after 18 months as-is with no documented complaints. Consensus on<br/>
bard bulletin boards is that VI does not want to spend time to fix song and<br/>
has instead opted for a cop-out nerf. Song has random 0-9 second duration, 3<br/>
second casting time, and higher resists than snare/root. If song is left<br/>
as-is, bards want a full 9 second chain to make up for reduced strength &<br/>
high resists, now it is just weak AND unpredictable. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Works as intended. The previous operation of the spell<br/>
yielded creatures that would stop cold when fleeing at aroudn 50% health.<br/>
Rather than fight like a rooted NPC (which would have been fine), the NPCs<br/>
would do nothing while getting beaten for half of their life.&lt;&lt;&lt;  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;See above.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Answer is untrue anyhow, it stopped mobs at 33%, not 50%.  What they don&#39;t<br/>
mention is they also changed the health point at which mobs slow down when<br/>
running without a spell on them to be lower.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Denon&#39;s Dissension (35) - Intended to be a mana draining song. Drains<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mana<br/>
at an incredibly slow pace. In PvP, a player with breeze or clarity can<br/>
easily outpace mana drain done by this song. Use against mobs of same level<br/>
an exercise in futility unless bard has about an hour to drain the mob&#39;s<br/>
mana. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - This spell is working as intended. If we need to<br/>
reevaluate it at some point we can.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That&#39;s an open door we have NEVER had before.  As a matter of fact, any<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time this has <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;been brought up, we&#39;ve gotten the aformentioned Lullaby/Chains answer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I ever see a reevaluation on bards that ends up different from &quot;working<br/>
as intended&quot; maybe I&#39;d believe that.  That has never occurred.  Clerics get<br/>
one spell changed and we see multiple posts promising to reevaluate it<br/>
immediately and it happens.  Bards see &quot;If we need to reevaluate it at some<br/>
point we can.&quot; and get nothing back ever other than &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br/>
Let&#39;s face it, if a core class like Clerics or Warriors or Enchanters<br/>
complain about a change, it gets looked into immediately and with some<br/>
degree of openess.  Auxilliary (their word actually) classes like the bard<br/>
do the same we get &quot;If we need to reevaluate it at some point we can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Selo&#39;s Assonaint Strane (54)/Rondo - An AE slow song intended to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>upgrade to<br/>
level 20 AE slow song. The problem: Instrument has no effect on 54 song,<br/>
resulting in a 20% slow versus 35% from level 20 song. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- I&#39;ll ask testing to check instrument effectiveness.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No reason to complain about that *yet*.  Wait until the testing is done.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same as above.  Testing has thus far always resulted in &quot;working as<br/>
intended&quot; even when obviously ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;BAD QUEST ISSUES&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My question here is &quot;Didn&#39;t you post a while back that there is now someone<br/>
that does nothing but work on quests?&quot;  This too will come back to haunt<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* No one has seen a Burnyai Bunt Cake (Firiona Vie quest from Scout<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Treekill<br/>
for a bard helm). Can someone confirm that item can be found on a live<br/>
server? <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This isn&#39;t a quest. It&#39;s a story. The item isn&#39;t in game<br/>
purposely.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Okay, at least we can stop looking.  Perhaps they can take the text out<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about a bard&#39;s &gt;helm being offered for the Cake?<br/>
It&#39;s not much of a story.  Just don&#39;t want to admit it&#39;s a snipe hunt joke<br/>
aimed at bards me thinks.  It very specifically says &quot;I&#39;d trade you this<br/>
helm a bard left me if you could get me one&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Singing Short Sword. Haste effect a proc that is marginally better than<br/>
 </span></blockquote>existing bard haste songs and worse than enchanter haste buffs. Proc effect<br/>
cancels the better enchanter haste spells. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- We&#39;re reevaluating several of the epic-quest items<br/>
tomorrow.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Again, no reason to complain until we hear from them on it.  Any<br/>
 </span></blockquote>complaining now would &gt;just be a waste of energy.<br/>
They&#39;re hearing this one from everyone nearly, except clerics as far as I<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Helm(Eye of Zomm)/helm/gloves- I dont really see any use for this, even<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as a novelty.I<br/>
agree there needs to be more fun items in the game, but please dont make<br/>
this an item that comes off a level 55 mob.<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It&#39;s not something that they are required to wear. It&#39;s a<br/>
choice. If they feel that it has no value, they should seek out something<br/>
more to their liking.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Definite weak answer.  Another thing to bring up to &quot;other folks at VI&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*eg*<br/>
No we are not required to wear it?  Agreed, wth?  No one would ever wear<br/>
this except for pure ac and even that is questionable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Brestplate(Invigorate)- A 100 point heal, with a very long cast time.I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dont<br/>
know one bard who would use this..You must stop singing to use effects.A<br/>
bard at the level it would take to aquire this would get MUCH greater effect<br/>
for the whole group by just twisting 1 or 2 songs.<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Maybe we should reevaluate this one. This is supposed to<br/>
be a good effect. A bard can get nearly this value of healing in the casting<br/>
time of the breastplate just by playing their song with the appropriate<br/>
instrument.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;See the &quot;wait&quot; comment above.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sigh, there is a point at which wait is no longer an acceptable answer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Gloves-( Enduring breathe) again, this would be useful to someone who<br/>
 </span></blockquote>isnt a<br/>
bard.There is currently one dungeon in the game that requires water<br/>
breathing.Kedge Keep...I dont know any bards who can solo there, if any<br/>
exists...Therefore, if a bard is down there, he is with a group..if he is<br/>
with a group, he will be singing his enduring breathe song most<br/>
likely...kinda redundant..<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It&#39;s not something that they are required to wear. It&#39;s a<br/>
choice. If they feel that it has no value, they should seek out something<br/>
more to their liking. In regards to the complaint that the bard will already<br/>
be singing the water-breathing song, by having this item the bard no longer<br/>
has the need to do that, allowing them to twist other, more preferable<br/>
songs. It is very useful in limited circumstances.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Along with the Summon Food/Water, I&#39;ve always liked this effect (although<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there should <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;be more than 1 water or food item summoned).  *shrugs*  Personal taste<br/>
 </span></blockquote>issue I guess.<br/>
I guess this could be useful, Summon 1 water or Food though???<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Legs-(Summon Food) The casting time on this is way too long, specially<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
something that comes off such a mob.It is more time effectiant for a bard to<br/>
beg a local magician to summon him 20 food 20 drink in the time it takes a<br/>
bard to produce 1 food 1 drink.I think it should be replaced with<br/>
cornicopia.This will not be unbalancing if you keep it&#39;s current casting<br/>
time.And this wont take away the newbie mage mainstay for making money,<br/>
summoning, because at the level it takes to get/use this item, who would sit<br/>
around summoning food to sell to newbies?<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - The spell may very well be inappropriate. We&#39;ll put it on<br/>
the list for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Boots(Summon drink) pretty much same argument as legs..<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, what a joke.<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -This one too.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
There ya go :o)  (Personally, I think this is mainly becasue of the fear of<br/>
bad publicity from a bad taste standpoint, ala Mystere).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;My suggestions..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Helm-Some sort of Charisma buff<br/>
Brestplate-Something like illusion werewolf..it makes roleplay sense, as the<br/>
bards in Mistmoore do it.<br/>
Arms-A Dexerity Buff<br/>
Bracers-Keep the same<br/>
Gloves-An agi buff<br/>
Pants-Cornicopia<br/>
Boots-Everfont<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Nearly all of the spells on all of the activatable armor<br/>
(across all classes) has limited usefulness. The spells suggested here would<br/>
all be very useful, leading to balance problems with the activatable items<br/>
of other classes. In the end, though I do want to revisit a couple of the<br/>
items, it is still the choice of the bard to wear or not wear this armor.<br/>
The armor itself is not meant to be an upgrade to planar armor, but an<br/>
alternative. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Personally I want Illusion Vox for the helm ;o)  Some of the items will be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>re-visited, &gt;let&#39;s just wait and see.<br/>
I&#39;d be happy with Aura of the snake or whatever the low level shaman buff<br/>
is, hardly unbalancing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Stuck songs/Start/stop songs  - bards occasionally get stuck on a song<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and are unable to<br/>
stop it. Difficult to replicate, but appears to be associated with lag. Once<br/>
stuck, the /stopsong command has no effect. The only know cure is to spam<br/>
the hotkey/gem repeatedly (a few dozen times) or log. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - We&#39;ve never been able to pin this one down. If they have a<br/>
way to do it, the testing department would be very happy to talk about it on<br/>
the QA board.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If they can pin it down, it will get fixed.  Granted, all they would have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to do is hit &gt;a live server and watch a real bard for a few minutes to see<br/>
it.<br/>
I doubt they can find this without coming over a connection thru a distance<br/>
farther than San Diego to San Diego, but we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Songs breaking rogue sneaking. Two issues: bards able to break rogues<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sneaking even if rogue not in same group and bards singing mana song break<br/>
rouges sneaking even if rogue a moderate distance away. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - I&#39;ve asked Roger to bump this up on his plate. It&#39;s been<br/>
around for a while and we should get it fixed.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Although that&#39;s more of a Rogue issue than bard... I think.  Working on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>being fixed.<br/>
Let&#39;s not start on the whole Hide/Sneak issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Chords of Dissonance (2)/Disruptive Discord (10)  - no animation when<br/>
 </span></blockquote>playing song and no mobs in<br/>
range. Very dangerous with AE damage song. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This is how these spells work.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My question to that wouold be &quot;Why is that intended?&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who knows and obviously no one at VI cares.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Selo&#39;s no longer breaks root on PvP servers. Since release, if a bard<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had<br/>
selo&#39;s song up and was rooted by a player/mob, the next pulse of speed song<br/>
would break the root (if song was not up prior to root, song would not break<br/>
it). A recent unannounced patch eliminated this ability resulting in many<br/>
PvP bard&#39;s deaths. Bard&#39;s are mostly upset because there are so many<br/>
legitimate, long-standing problems with the class and these are types of<br/>
things being worked on. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- The fact that it ever broke root was a bug. While I<br/>
understand the desire for us to fix &quot;long standing problems&quot; before working<br/>
on issues of this nature, this turned out to be a quick fix that was very<br/>
easily addressed. We could leave stuff like this in while doing all of the<br/>
other fixes, however we&#39;d then have to deal with complaints that &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
always been like this&quot; and &quot;why didn&#39;t we fix it sooner&quot;. It&#39;s a bit of a<br/>
double-edged sword.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Obviously they don&#39;t cause it still breaks root on the Live non-PvP servers.<br/>
If you get rooted while Selo&#39;s is up it breaks it, you still have the icon<br/>
and can move.  You just cannot start the song while Rooted.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Lock picking. Bards get skill at level 40. Skill is capped so low that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bards can only open doors in Befallen and gate to the Hole. Raising skill<br/>
would be nice to open Kunark doors - why is a level 40 bard opening doors in<br/>
newbie dungeon? (check bard count at primetime hours, and you&#39;ll be lucky to<br/>
see more than 12 45+ bards on any server). <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Bard lock-picking is supposed to have limited usefulness.<br/>
At the moment there are very few locked doors in mid-level dungeons that<br/>
would be appropriate targets for Bard lock-picking. Perhaps at some point it<br/>
might be appropriate for a newer zone.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Newer zone?  Like SoV or The Warrens?  Hmmmmm...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since those are going to be more high level zones, why would they cap the<br/>
skil lower on those locks???<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Disarm Traps. Ok, no traps to disarm. Rogues got new skills (backstab &<br/>
 </span></blockquote>evade) to make up for this, bards were promised it would be looked into as<br/>
well, but never got anything. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Creation of bard songs and other enhancements that have<br/>
been made took into account that this skill is not useful in its current<br/>
form.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Again, &quot;What songs/enhacnements?&quot;<br/>
&gt;(btw, Evade came from the high taunt factor of Backstab, and Backstab has<br/>
 </span></blockquote>always been <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a Rogue skill)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know all those new songs we were promised at release but did not get<br/>
until later.  In other words, more total BS.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Skill caps on singing, percussion, string, brass, and wind still at 200<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for bards over level 50. Other casting classes have casting skills up to<br/>
250. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - Other casting classes don&#39;t go up to 250, but I&#39;m not<br/>
opposed to increasing the instrument caps to reduce failures. We&#39;ll put it<br/>
in the next patch.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyone else here remember hearing that song/instrument skills would *NEVER*<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be &gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;increased?  *wide grin*<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but at the same time they said magical skills would never increase and<br/>
ranger defensive skills would never increase.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Dodge/Parry. Bards get skills at 53 and 58 respectively. Way too high<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
most players to ever see them and excessively high compared to other classes<br/>
that get these skills in 20s and 30s. Both parry & riposte capped at 70.<br/>
Below is summary of all melee/hybrid combat skills to put this into<br/>
perspective:<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - I understand the point, but the skills were not meant to<br/>
be a large balance component to the class, but rather a reward for making it<br/>
that high in level. Decreasing the level of acquisition or increasing the<br/>
caps wouldn&#39;t be appropriate.&lt;&lt;&lt;   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Ahh, but any skill that isn&#39;t high enough to be useful isn&#39;t really a skill<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is it?   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Another item to bring up later (I think in time that will go the same way<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as the &gt;instrument skill caps)<br/>
<br/>
Point well made and was mine as well.  At the level and cap we get them they<br/>
are useless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our input Abashi. Lots of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>good suggestions out there. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- No 49th level song is planned at this time.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No excuse for that.  Just plain laziness.  Get your nose out of Lucas&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>back-side and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;finsish this game FIRST ;p<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It brings no revenue and isn&#39;t Yak&#39;s area so it won&#39;t get done.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Could musical instruments (when viewed) contain information on which<br/>
 </span></blockquote>skill<br/>
they are for? Percussion/String/Wind/Brass. Not always obvious on wind/brass<br/>
instruments. Also, would be fantastic to see something like &quot;+10% to some<br/>
brass&quot; or &quot;+5% to combat wind&quot;. Often, only very high level bards can<br/>
baseline instrument improvements today (hard to see 5% improvement if song<br/>
only adds 5 strength). <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] - I suppose we can compromise here. We&#39;ll have the skill<br/>
used displayed on the item tag following the next client-patch, but won&#39;t<br/>
list the direct modifiers.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As with the skill caps on instruments, I remember him saying that that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>would *NEVER* <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;be implemented.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, they just said they would never display the bonus info.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge (43) - 800 mana for AE 275 damage.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Breeze/Clarity/Mana song have no effect on bards mana regen (takes 30+<br/>
minutes to recharge when OOM), making this song the absolute worst in terms<br/>
of damage/downtime. With 39 charm song now using mana, bards never use this<br/>
song. Abashi started a thread asking for input and consensus was: allow song<br/>
to be memmed, sung immediately (at no mana cost), and then have a 15-minute<br/>
effect on player where song could not be sung again. Let&#39;s face it, 800 mana<br/>
is 80-90% of a bards mana and doesn&#39;t leave much for charming. 275 damage on<br/>
a level 43 mob is less than one half of one bub of hp. <br/>
* Mana on 39 charm song. Biggest problem is that after a rez, a bard has no<br/>
mana, and often takes almost an hour to get back to FM. The ability for a<br/>
bard to charm should be dependent on this. <br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This is as designed. Bards are not supposed to get any<br/>
benefit from +mana songs. Using one of their two mana-using songs is<br/>
supposed to have a large cost. It is the drawback for having powerful<br/>
songs.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;At the higher levels, this song isn&#39;t really &quot;powerful&quot;.  I feel that this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>too will be <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;re-addressed in time.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sadly, I&#39;d say dream on.  this will likely never change.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Instrument pieces. Lots of bardic instrument pieces at vendors<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(including<br/>
one in Kunark), but no way to put them together. Perhaps add to tinkering or<br/>
put in bard only instrument skill (like research).<br/>
<br/>
[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Odds and ends are possible avenues for future content<br/>
additions.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;*shrugs*  What I&#39;ve always figured.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Odds and ends left over from a planned implementation in Beta that got<br/>
scrapped actually.  If this ever happens in a meaningful way I will eat the<br/>
paper this is printed on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As you can see, we got a couple of VERY BIG concessions.  I think with<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-=B=-<br/>
&gt;The Rathe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, we couldn&#39;t disagree more.  Oh well, if you are happy with the progress<br/>
I guess that is something.  Personally I was insulted.  I&#39;d say the only<br/>
concessions made were trivial at best.  Far as I can see this whole post<br/>
could have been covered by just saying some things are &quot;If we need to<br/>
reevaluate it at some point we can.&quot; and a few are &quot;working as intended&quot;,<br/>
the minor ones we&#39;ll fix just like we said we would 3 or 4 patches ago.<br/>
