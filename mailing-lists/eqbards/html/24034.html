<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297024112">Hmm maybe thats it, I keep reiceving offers to trade accounts.  I was asking<br/>
my guild if there is some uber bard patch coming...  (Seriosuly I got 3<br/>
offers this weekend, maybe they were all from secondaries of a single who is<br/>
desperate for a bard or something)</div>
