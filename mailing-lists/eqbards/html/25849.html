Yeah, it&#39;s not for everyone, but if you&#39;re looking for an alternative to the<br/>
keyboard, this can&#39;t be beat.  :)<br/>

Long)<br/>

I checked it out, felt it, fondled it, and promptly decided against it.<br/>
All of the things the Nostromo does, my keyboard does just as well - <br/>
without sacrificing deskspace, or having to add yet another control - and <br/>
it saves me $30 ;)  I already have my keyboard set up in FPS mode for EQ <br/>
(as well as Counterstrike, etc).  That setup gives me the exact same <br/>
control surfaces except the hat switch (which you describe as antsy at <br/>
best), the throttle (which you can&#39;t find a use for).  Actually, because of <br/>
my particular setup, I end up with more &quot;easily accessible&quot; controls than <br/>
the Nostromo gives, without having to press shift, ctrl or alt.  But those <br/>
are all easy to get to, too.  The one thing I did like about the Nostromo <br/>
is the &quot;ergo&quot; feel of it.  Get me an ergo keyboard that doesn&#39;t feel all <br/>
wonky, though, and I&#39;m back where you are.  And without sacrificing typing <br/>
speed ;)  I like to type and shoot...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;At least go and check out the picture of it.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For those wanting a little more detail:<br/>
&gt;I had it setup, ready for EQ, in about 5 minutes.  I had it connected to my<br/>
&gt;USB port forever, and after installing the software, I had a configuration<br/>
&gt;setup for EQ rather quickly.  You can either assign keystrokes to a button<br/>
&gt;press, or create macros.  The utility is very intuitive, with an image of<br/>
&gt;the controller and the area where you actually assign a function to the<br/>
&gt;button.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The image helps you locate the button you&#39;re trying to set.  When you press<br/>
&gt;the button on the controller, the corresponding button on the image lights<br/>
&gt;up, as well as the field where you actually set the value to the keypress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Click on the field, which gives a menu.  There are 2 important selections.<br/>
&gt;Assign a key, or assign a macro.  If you click assign a key, it brings up a<br/>
&gt;little window, you press the key you want assigned to that button, click<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ok,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and it&#39;s set.  If you select assign a macro, it brings up a window.  In the<br/>
&gt;name, you name the macro, so you know what it is.  You also have the option<br/>
&gt;of saving the interval between key presses.  I disable this, although, with<br/>
&gt;a lot of trial and error, you could probably get some spectacular results.<br/>
&gt;Click Start, and every keypress and release, until you click Stop, is<br/>
&gt;recorded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;attack&lt;enter&gt;, and then clicked Stop.  End result, when I hit that key in<br/>
&gt;game, in less than a second, the typing bar comes up, &quot;/pet attack&quot; is<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Starting on the top row of buttons, from left to right, I set button 1 with<br/>
&gt;the Pet Attack macro.  Buttons 2, 3, 4, and 5 activate gems 5, 6, 7, 8<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(home<br/>

&gt;7, 8, 9, and 10 activate gems 1, 2, 3, and 4.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t figured out a use for the throttle, the only rotary function I<br/>
&gt;know of is scrolling the chat box.  I have a wheel mouse, and am too used<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;using that with it, but if you don&#39;t have a wheel mouse, you can probably<br/>
&gt;assign chat scroll to it.  There is also a 8 way D-pad.  I only assigned<br/>
 </span></blockquote>up,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;down, left, and right to the corresponding arrow keys, but you can also<br/>
&gt;assign the diagonals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is also a shift function.  Red shift, blue shift, and green shift.<br/>
&gt;When you use the shift function, you can assign additional functions to a<br/>
&gt;button that is already assigned.  Just like hitting shift and then 7 for &.<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t messed with this much, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bottom line, it feels completely different than the keyboard.  You have to<br/>
&gt;get used to it.  I still fall back to the keyboard, if I get confused, and<br/>
&gt;mess up my twist.  However, I&#39;m confident that once I get the hang of it,<br/>
&gt;and get used to which gem spot is which key, it will blow away the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>keyboard.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This controller in the left hand, and the mouse in the right, it just feels<br/>
&gt;right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only ding, the D-pad is at the same time not sensitive enough, yet over<br/>
&gt;sensitive.  It&#39;s hard to explain.  I feel like I have to press up<br/>
&gt;exceptionally hard to move forward, yet it takes the slightest movement off<br/>
&gt;of true to get enough pressure on left or right, and start to turn.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps, another thing to get used to, but right now, it&#39;s a small<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also play Ghost Recon.  I haven&#39;t since setting up the controller, but I<br/>
&gt;plan on it this weekend.  It was made for shooters, so I&#39;m looking forward<br/>
&gt;to it.  :)<br/>

&gt;Actually, I am - I do a lot of instrument switching, and the timer lets me<br/>
