&gt;Subject: [eqbards] What class does GZ play?<br/>
&gt;Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1999 11:28:46 -0400<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m hoping to finally hit level 50 within the next week or so, and I <br/>
&gt;decided<br/>
&gt;to do a little reading up on other classes to see if there&#39;s something else<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to play.  I was on the Shaman&#39;s Crucible, and came across an<br/>
&gt;interview they had with GZ.  Found this question interesting. . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;TSC: Alright, now time to take that mask off... What class/race are you<br/>
&gt;currently having the most fun playing?<br/>
&gt;GZ: I have got to say that I love my 1/2 elf Bard - but mostly because when<br/>
&gt;I play, I am a very social player. Bards are good at being social. In fact,<br/>
&gt;I built them to be so. This is my current one - I have played a lot of EQ,<br/>
&gt;and tend to change my opinion every few weeks.<br/>
