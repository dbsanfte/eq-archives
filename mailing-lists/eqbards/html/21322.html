<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437673511">Personally, I liked the way PvP was handled in the old NWN (on AOheLl) where<br/>
you had a lot of zones that weren&#39;t PvP, and a few that were.  To get from<br/>
Neverwinter to Longsaddle (for instance)  you could take the short route<br/>
through the Lost Hills (which were PvP) or the longer way (which was not<br/>
PvP).  That way, whenever you set foot in the Hills and did a &lt;whatever the<br/>
command was&gt; to see who all was in the area, if you saw certain guild names<br/>
like MECH, UDL, KAAOS, etc. you knew you were rolling the dice and taking<br/>
the chance of getting jumped.  Sure, it wasn&#39;t &quot;realistic&quot;, but it let the<br/>
player make the decision every time they decided to make the trip.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Isn&#39;t Horizons another one of those games where the developers think<br/>
&gt; &gt;that in spite of UO having nothing but problems with PKs and grief<br/>
&gt; &gt;players, and EQ showing the overwhelming majority prefer a PvP<br/>
&gt; &gt;switch, that they can come up with the perfect, abuse free forced PvP<br/>
&gt; &gt;environment?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, and no.  I don&#39;t think they believe that their PvP environment will<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; perfect, but they think it will be good.  I like the concept behind it and<br/>
&gt; generally I abhor PvP because it is all about PK for the most part.  Two<br/>
&gt; things they are doing will make a huge difference.  Like the Team PvP<br/>
&gt; servers, only races openly at war can PvP one another without consequence.<br/>
&gt; The big difference is, there will not be a way to tell the difference<br/>
&gt; between PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s on sight.  If you see an Orc on the road ahead and<br/>
&gt; you are an elf, you know that he is dangerous to you, whether he is a<br/>
player<br/>
&gt; or an npc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Their consequence system is brutal against PK&#39;ers.  If you kill a race<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; you are not at war with, even a mere 5 or 6 times you will suffer enormous<br/>
&gt; problems.  These problems will include having npc bounty-hunters showing<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; to kill you at random.  Playing a PK character would rapidly become<br/>
&gt; unplayable as every time you logged in you were ambush by these npc<br/>
&gt; enforcers.  Even if you kept your PK-ing to a race yours was at war with,<br/>
&gt; you would always find yourself in enemy territory where few would feel any<br/>
&gt; compunction against killing you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wasn&#39;t really interested much in Horizons initailly due to it&#39;s PvP<br/>
&gt; system, but they have convinced me to give it a chance.  They feel their<br/>
PvP<br/>
&gt; system will promote the &#39;risk game&#39; like Player competition while severely<br/>
&gt; punishing to the point of oblivion anyone who PK&#39;s for the joy of hurting<br/>
&gt; others.  Time will tell.<br/>
