<div id="ygrps-yiv-652729825">Its 1HB 5/28 Magic Item wgt 6.5 lbs.<br/>
Classes and Races is All/All.  I imagine this is going to be the object of a<br/>
further quest as its not too exciting as is.  In fact I just heard from my<br/>
wizard friend that is already used as a component for a wizard item, The<br/>
staff of temperate flux.  Whether more quests will use this item (which<br/>
identifies as a Staff of Ro) or not is unknown at this time.  Its definitely<br/>
not worth a staff of writhing so go tanks!<br/>

&gt; I have bought 2 stones, for 15pp each. One person asked me for 100, i<br/>
&gt; told them all us bards had gotten together and would not pay more than<br/>
&gt; 20, so she sold it to me for 15... go figure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What about the staff? is the lambent stone the only requirement? what<br/>
&gt; are the stats on the staff? who can use it?<br/>

&gt; &gt; If its any comfort for you i&#39;ve never paid over 20pp for a stone, except<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first one i paid 70 for cause i was desperate.... most of the stones<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; gotten for 15pp.  i&#39;ve had a few whine that it worth way more then that,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; i just laughed at them and wished em luck...<br/>
