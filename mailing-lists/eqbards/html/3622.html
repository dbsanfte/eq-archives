<div id="ygrps-yiv-790834513">Actually even though I am a woodsy, I never went into Crushbone until<br/>
after I had been to such exotic places as BB and Paw, well exotic for one<br/>
born on Faydwyr.  But lord knows I was quivering every minute the first time<br/>
in Paw since I knew it was a 45 minute run back from Qeynos as there was no<br/>
one in Arena to bind me and our groups only 12th level caster was a cleric,<br/>
thus no bind yet.  I&#39;m irritated by the bind thing because I travel a lot<br/>
and don&#39;t have the patience to sit at a bandit camp for more than about half<br/>
an hour.  I can think of no level after 7th where I gained all my xp on one<br/>
continent, much less one zone.<br/>

    Qeynos to Paw is nowhere near 45 min.  More like 10-15 in my experience.<br/>
Hunted in paw at 14 and 15<br/>

    while bound in Q, then hunted N. karanas to 16.  I&#39;ve made the W.<br/>
Karanas crossing several times.<br/>
