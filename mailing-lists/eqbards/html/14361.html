<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-243051310">I&#39;m waiting for on official acknowledgement and response from GZ (generally<br/>
speaking, I have not personally sent him anything) regarding the Sonorous<br/>
Clouding issue.  GZ says it allows you to see party member but it does not.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone comes across this admission of guilt please post it to the list.<br/>
I was truly amazed that the bard weapon proc&#39;ing bug from the last patch was<br/>
addressed so quickly...this is unusual treatment for bards based on the<br/>
track record.<br/>
<br/>
Since the post-Christmas server overcrowding and the last few weeks worth of<br/>
buggy side affects in patches that have adversely affected bards, I have<br/>
somewhat shelved Faras and started up secondaries to take a break from the<br/>
dirge to 50 and enjoy being a newbie again.  Let me tell you, when lguk has<br/>
90 people in it and you stand at the zone shouting for a group for an hour<br/>
it is refreshing to log a level 5 troll shaman into innothule and get 2<br/>
levels in two hours.<br/>
