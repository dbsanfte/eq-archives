&gt;Hey!  What about...  Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would require me to be a LOT higher level than I currently am.  I just<br/>
started RaceWar Talies on Saturday - he&#39;s only 7th level now.  No twinking,<br/>
not really powerleveling - in fact, I even stopped to make the mail run all<br/>
over Faydwer three times, plus play in the Racewar for several hours last<br/>
night.<br/>
The closest to twinked is a Dwarf paid me a FS Longsword to lead him to a<br/>
location he couldn&#39;t find.  It was worth it to him.  It was worth it to me,<br/>
too *grins*<br/>
