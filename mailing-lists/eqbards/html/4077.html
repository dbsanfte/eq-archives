<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217494584">Ok, I suppose if your primary goal in this game is to get to<br/>
level 50 as quickly as possible, then selling the crown and<br/>
using the plat to equip yourself is the way to go.  Just<br/>
remember, there will *always* be something bigger and meaner<br/>
than you in this game for you to fight.  While advancing<br/>
quickly may inflate your ego (and I don&#39;t mean that in a<br/>
derogatory way), it deprives you of time to explore and<br/>
experience things meant for people your current level, good<br/>
and bad.  Some day, a level 15 player will gaze at your level<br/>
45 awesomeness, and ask you for advice, and you will be unable<br/>
to give him any because at his level you had equipment way<br/>
beyond his means.<br/>
<br/>
I never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>
immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>
sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>
whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>
for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>
to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>
by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>
be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.  To each his own.<br/>
