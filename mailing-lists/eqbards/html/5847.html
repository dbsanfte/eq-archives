&gt; Ahh - that explains the problem.  I&#39;m lucky enough that I had a backup of<br/>
&gt; my EQ files when my hard drive crashed the other day.  I never changed my<br/>
&gt; bound keys, so I have left and right as &#39;A&#39; and &#39;D&#39; respectively.<br/>
&gt; Conveniently, this is also what user defined 5 and 6 are set to.  I have<br/>
&gt; sense heading on one, and forage on the other.  Life&#39;s good for da bard ;)<br/>
&gt; (I also have &quot;Corpse&quot; set to User 5 and 6 in bank 5 for when I&#39;m trying to<br/>
&gt; do a speed corpse retrieval)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By the time I heard of this dual bind trick I already had every page<br/>
mapped out with various hotkeys and I didn&#39;t want to have to reorganize<br/>
them to fit so the movement keys wouldn&#39;t do something I didn&#39;t want on<br/>
one of the various pages. I&#39;d hate to sit down when trying to run from a<br/>
mob because I was accidently on the wrong macro page. :)<br/>
