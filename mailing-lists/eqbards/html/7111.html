&gt; This is a good list of bard related things to fix, and since John&#39;s list is<br/>
&gt; almost entirely what I would consider bugs, I would have no problem signing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I could add one thing:  raise the skill cap on Instill Doubt and/or make it<br/>
&gt; so it is not dependent on landing a kick in order to work.  I have personally<br/>
&gt; pressed the Instill Doubt button THOUSANDS of times, and never gained a point or<br/>
&gt; scared anyone.  If we&#39;re going to have a skill, at least make it work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hit 100 in instill doubt last night.  I have a sad feeling that is probably our<br/>
cap, but I&#39;ll<br/>
check next time I visit Freeport to be sure.  I strongly encourage all bards (and<br/>
monks<br/>
and rogues) to practice and get this skill up there - it still doesn&#39;t work all the<br/>
time, but<br/>
it has saved my life once or twice, and it frequently now makes battles a little<br/>
easier to<br/>
finish up in groups.  A few pointers:<br/>
<br/>
-Yes, this skill is *sloooow* in raising, especially until you get it into the 40s<br/>
or so.  I&#39;d<br/>
recommend in waiting to train it until you have 15-20 training points to waste,<br/>
therefore<br/>
pumping it immediately up into slightly useful range.<br/>
<br/>
-You do *not* need a valid target for the skill to increase.  Corpses, PCs, pets,<br/>
and NPCs<br/>
out of range will all check the skill and check for a skill raise.  So, don&#39;t think<br/>
you need to<br/>
stand in front of some stationary guard to practice it.  When you&#39;re running across<br/>
West<br/>
Karana, for instance, select a hapless player corpse, and hit instill doubt every<br/>
time it<br/>
un-greys as you run across the zone.<br/>
<br/>
-If you happen to play on a team or PvP server, be *very* careful when you practice<br/>
this<br/>
on friends - I&#39;ve kicked people into trains, made them fall through the world...they<br/>
tend to<br/>
be kind of mad afterwords. :)<br/>
<br/>
-Even when it gets high, you still won&#39;t succeed very often, mostly due to the fact<br/>
that the<br/>
skill needs *4* successful checks to succeed:<br/>
1) You need to not fail your instill doubt skill check.<br/>
2) You need to not miss your kick.<br/>
3) The monster needs to not parry/block/riposte/dodge/etc your kick.<br/>
4) The monsters needs to non resist the fear spell check.<br/>
<br/>
So, don&#39;t expect miracles, but it is a nice, handy skill to have, and rather fun<br/>
too. :)<br/>
