&gt; Actually, it&#39;s odd. Until very very recently this list was populated with<br/>
&gt; discussion of how to get the most from the class not complaining about what<br/>
&gt; how it was nerfed, broken, ignored, unattended to.<br/>
&gt; As the latest patches did not change us radically (SoW/Selos/Root/chain have<br/>
&gt; been messed up in different ways forever), it must be some other factor at<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How have they been messed up?  I think the change is because<br/>
until the latest Chain/Selo&#39;s/root fiascos, we were masters of<br/>
our destiny.  From level 5, we had almost nothing to fear.  <br/>
If things got bad, we could always bail out.  If facing<br/>
multiple mobs, we had the tools to break them up or control<br/>
them.  The latest changes have started chipping away at that,<br/>
putting us more and more at the mercy of others (being rooted,<br/>
being SoWed, Chain not stopping runners, etc).  While in<br/>
themselves they are minor changes, they represent a major<br/>
shift in the amount of control we have over what happens to<br/>
us.<br/>
