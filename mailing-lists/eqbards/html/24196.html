<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924517192"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; recast is not an issue since you can swap it out whenever you <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have enough<br/>
&gt; mana to cast it and swap it back in when you do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s not even worth that much effort.  the time it would take to sit, unmem<br/>
one song, mem DDD, use DDD, sit, unmem DDD, remem other song is too much<br/>
effort for this song.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it may be pitiful, but so is bard melee.  does that mean you <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t melee at all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s another subject.  i don&#39;t think bard melee is pitiful, just the least<br/>
of the melee classes.  bard melee+SSS+songs pushes us way up on the list,<br/>
though i know that is not what you said is pitiful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for the sake of brevity, i&#39;ll just point to my earlier <br/>
&gt; posts where i pointed out when an<br/>
&gt; excellent time to use this song was, which wouldn&#39;t mess up <br/>
&gt; the enchanter at all and would<br/>
&gt; do a significant amount of damage.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>again, the damage you do is not even worth the effort, and not worth the<br/>
mana the healer will spend on fixing the damage you took while the enchanter<br/>
messed the 2-4 mobs beating on you that DDD hit.<br/>
