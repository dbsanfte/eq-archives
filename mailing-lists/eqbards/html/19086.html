<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390748511">Thanks for the congrats (My guild was pretty excitied since I am the<br/>
only bard and we are caster heavy).  If you need to convince yourself to<br/>
go to kunark, talk to me.  After being stagnated at lvl 20, I went to<br/>
just hitting 26 in two weeks (admittedly my full time job became only a<br/>
35 hour job for some of that time).  <br/>
<br/>
I then returned to anotnica to get some lambent peices (bracers), spent<br/>
a week losing and regainging 26, 7 times.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to kunark and in two daysd was half way to 29 :)  (Granted<br/>
those were weekend days and include an 8 hour guild raid on Dalinar&#39;s)<br/>
<br/>
Have become a uber-mega-power leveler?  No.  Have I suddenly gotten<br/>
better?  No, just the normal progression.  ROK has so many great<br/>
outdoors area, its is hard for bards to die there, plain and simple :)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
