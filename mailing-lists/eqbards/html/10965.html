<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546714147">LOL, how do you know who our characters know? =) Please don&#39;t ASSume such <br/>
things. Mine come from the same town, it&#39;s highly likely they know eachother <br/>
and may even be related!<br/>
<br/>
Currently the facts are there is not much to do for lvl 50&#39;s on a server <br/>
crowded with high levels so twinking is going to happen. Until Verant gets <br/>
off their asses and stops nerfing the freakin game, and does something about <br/>
it that&#39;s the way it&#39;s gonna be. There are many things we could do, but you <br/>
know what - on my server almost EVERY night those many things we could do <br/>
are already being done by someone else. 80 people in Lower Guk average, 60 <br/>
people in Sol B, usually at least a group doing Kedge, and it&#39;s hard to get <br/>
the right people together for a planes raid so when those raids happen they <br/>
happen. Dragons pop once a week, FG&#39;s pop every 8 hours - BOTH life spans <br/>
are a couple hours at most (no lie). We complain to Verant, and what do they <br/>
do? They add a bunch of rediculously high level mobs to Kith, screwing all <br/>
the low level travellers. Now you tell me what else is there to do. Please <br/>
tell me now - thx info! Trust me, I have tried and tried lately to find <br/>
something xp-gaining for Sart to do with NO luck. Maybe if Paw doesn&#39;t suck <br/>
it may help a LITTLE, but it is not a very large place (comparatively). <br/>
We&#39;ll see how that turns out.<br/>
<br/>
Ph34r my bad grammar! =P<br/>

just my 2,000,000 plat..<br/>

&gt;Because your chars don&#39;t know each other from a hole in the ground. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think twinking should be acceptable just because level 50 people <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;bored.  They should give the level 50 people something to do then. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you adventure and get an item you can&#39;t use.. give it to someone else.<br/>
&gt;Trade it for something of an appropriate level that you CAN use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes this will not happen because Verant does not have a problem with<br/>
&gt; &gt; twinking. If you adventure and get a item you can&#39;t use why shouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to make a new char and use it? That&#39;s what Verant said&#39;s and I <br/>
&gt;happen<br/>
&gt; &gt; to agree because what else is there for a level 50 to do?<br/>
