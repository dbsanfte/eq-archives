<div id="ygrps-yiv-428840026">Someone stated earlier that there are only 2 high level dungeons for all <br/>
those lvl 50&#39;s out there.  Well actually there are many more, the cities of <br/>
races that are KoS to you and your friends.  I have already seen Teir&#39;dal in <br/>
North Freeport killing the paladins there.  I know of at least 2 attempts by <br/>
good players to breach the gates of Neriak.  Personally I am looking forward <br/>
to storming the foul holes the Trolls and Orges call home.<br/>

And if nothing else this should get this thread KABOINGed hehe.</div>
