I don&#39;t think your idea has a snowball&#39;s chance in 4377.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are relying too much on Bellow.  Bards have many other songs<br/>
that can be of better use.  If you want to solo, there are many other ways<br/>
to do so.  Bellow is just like the kick that Warriors get, nothing too<br/>
powerful, just a bit of extra added damage.  Don&#39;t expect Bellow to be your<br/>
main damage source.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of struggling soloing blues, you should try grouping for a<br/>
change.  Bards are very effective in a group, as long as you don&#39;t continue<br/>
to Bellow.<br/>

PS - My most frustrating experience with a Bard was when I was playing my<br/>
Cleric and grouped with four tanks (War, War, Ranger, Pally) all around lvl<br/>
16.  We were fighting crocs in the Oasis.  I was just thinking how we could<br/>
rock with a Bard, when there was a lvl 17 Bard needing a group.  This Bard<br/>
kept using Bellow constantly.  I tried and tried to explain to him how much<br/>
more effective we would be if he played group songs to no avail.  I really<br/>
wanted to cry.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I being a level 27 Bard probably use Bellow more than any other song as<br/>
&gt; that little extra dmg is great. However I do feel that this song should do<br/>
&gt; more dmg than just the 1/2 level +1. It&#39;s quite pathetic to think that at<br/>
&gt; level 50 you will only do 26 DMG with it. Currently I am doing 14 dmg and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s good but not good enough to solo stuff without having lots of<br/>
&gt; downtime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally I feel that Bellow should be current Level +1 dmg so for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>example<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; at my level (27) I would do 28 dmg per bellow, or as another formula have<br/>
&gt; 1/2 current level + 5 dmg and an extra 5 dmg every 10 levels, so at level<br/>
&gt; 12 you do 1/2 level +5 dmg and then at level 22 you do 1/2 Level +10 dmg<br/>
&gt; and so on. this would not be over powered when you consider what other<br/>
&gt; melee classes get. We have not got Kick, Double attack, bash and don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; Critical hits etc. Plus we can&#39;t use 2 handed weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only problem I can see with Bellow doing more dmg is that people will<br/>
&gt; kite as a bard with a great deal of ease (I kited Born D&#39;inn at level 22<br/>
&gt; and it took me 35 minutes to kill him).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know Bards aren&#39;t supposed to be hardened fighters I just feel we lack<br/>
&gt; that cutting edge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there anyway that if everyone on this list agrees with me or if they<br/>
&gt; have another formula suggestion that we could petition verant and get it<br/>
&gt; changed? Or are verant only into &#39;Nerfing&#39;??<br/>
