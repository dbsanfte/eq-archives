The damage values for the 3 chant songs don&#39;t seem to be calculated<br/>
correctly.  Based on the info on the eqsongs website, at 50th level with a<br/>
Selos Drum I should be doing the following amount of damage:<br/>
<br/>
Level 30:  31 base damage per tick/42 per tick with Selos Drum/125 total for<br/>
3 ticks.  Your spreadsheet lists 62 damage total for 50th level with Selos<br/>
drum<br/>
<br/>
Level 38:  48 base damage per tick/65 per tick with Selos drum/195 total for<br/>
3 ticks.  Your spreadsheet lists 93 damage total for 50th level with Selos<br/>
drum.<br/>
<br/>
Level 46:  Same as 38 except your spreadsheet list 95 damage total for 50th<br/>
level with Selos drum.<br/>
<br/>
I think the values that are listed take into account the 2/3 PvP penalty.<br/>
But even if you factor that in, the values don&#39;t seem to be correct.  <br/>
<br/>
Also the speed debuff and damage values for Chords of Cessation do not match<br/>
up with the values posted on eqsongs.  EQsongs lists the damage as 50pts per<br/>
tick while you list 75.  Eqsongs lists the speed debuff as 16% while you<br/>
list 30%. <br/>

Sorry that it&#39;s a little late.  I&#39;ve been working on a side project.  <br/>
If anyone knows anything about interrupts generated by a keyboard, <br/>
please send me an e-mail (hint hint hint).<br/>
<br/>
Changes from the previous version are:<br/>
<br/>
Jothan&#39;s Provocation does not have a Dam Ab Shld and has 50% haste<br/>
Niv&#39;s doesn&#39;t stick with song of shields.<br/>
Song of Twilight effects were listed under song of Dawn.<br/>
Vov (50) is 30% haste.<br/>
Johnthan&#39;s Prov (45) is Self only, voice and it&#39;s effects are <br/>
currently unknown.<br/>
Melody of Ervaj is now 50.<br/>
Celerity (36) is 20% haste.<br/>
<br/>
Major Change: Since there are large holes in the damage tables, our <br/>
DoT songs (2, 18, 30, 38, 46, 48) now use formulas instead of tables; <br/>
these formulas are close, but not necessarily as accurate.<br/>
<br/>
As in the last time, right click and do a &quot;Save Target As...&quot; on the <br/>
files.<br/>
