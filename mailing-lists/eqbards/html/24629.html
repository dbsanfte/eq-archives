<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756479749">if fearing is allowed, sing fearsong. opponent will run to middle of arena<br/>
and stand ther until he dies by your weapons. i did that in team pvp and<br/>
almost killed the whole other group on my own, and also some spectators that<br/>
were standing too near and got feared too ;) just killed everything in the<br/>
middle of the arena, wasnt paying attention if it was a member of the other<br/>
group, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
otherwise, sing resistance against caster (ench, cleric, ...) and use snare<br/>
to slow and bellow to interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>

My guild is holding a &quot;Duelmania&quot; event at the Arena near Lake Rathetear<br/>
this Sunday.  I&#39;ve come very close to dueling in the past, but never have.<br/>
If anyone has good advice to share about this, I&#39;d be grateful.<br/>
