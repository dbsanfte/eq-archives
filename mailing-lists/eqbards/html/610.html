<b>Subject:</b> Which song for soloing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-949595908">Well met all, Pistov of Cazic-Thule here again.  I have just attained 12th<br/>
level and have to say that the Bellow is one of my favorite songs yet.  I<br/>
have a small problem though:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know which song to sing when soloing!<br/>
<br/>
Previously, I had stacked Anthem de Arms and the Whistling Warsong to push<br/>
my STR by 20 and give the attack speed bonus.  Pretty sweet if I do say so<br/>
myself.  However, now that I have the Bellow, I find myself using the<br/>
Bellow instead.  It seems that the extra &quot;kick&quot; for 7 every time means<br/>
more damage than just me swinging a bit quicker, especially when I fight<br/>
monsters that are difficult to hit that I miss often.  Has anyone else had<br/>
the same experience?<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone else stacked the Bellow with another song?  I know the<br/>
Bellow has an odd timing and I find myself starting it and stopping it so<br/>
often that I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d get another song in.  Have any of you had<br/>
any luck stacking it?<br/>
<br/>
BTW for those who may not know, stacking is when you keep two songs active<br/>
at once by stopping each song as soon as you see its effect text (Your<br/>
wounds begin to heal, You feel a surge of strength, You start to whistle,<br/>
etc.) and then immediately begin a new song.  The best songs to stack are<br/>
the Hymn, Chords of Dissonance, Anthem de Arms, and the Whistling Warsong.<br/>
<br/>
Any help and comment from others is appreciated.<br/>
