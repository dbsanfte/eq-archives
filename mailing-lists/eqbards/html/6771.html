&gt;avoiding being attacked via melee.  That&#39;s the distinction I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;trying to make, and why I think it&#39;s really stupid that our<br/>
&gt;defensive equipment and skills cap at just slightly higher<br/>
&gt;than a cleric&#39;s.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>oh that, *laughs* yeah, I can see that.But we do have the mass lull and we<br/>
can slow attacks on the whole pull, we have similar effects, we just can&#39;t<br/>
use them solo. When grouping I count on my warrior to act as my defensive<br/>
mechanism, and she is great at it.<br/>
I understand it could be *different*, I am just not sold on that it would be<br/>
*better* (from a game balance perspective) to not have bard-survival one of<br/>
the main focus&#39; of my group, just like pulling mobs off the cleric after a<br/>
heal or pulling mobs off the Wizard after a burn.<br/>
