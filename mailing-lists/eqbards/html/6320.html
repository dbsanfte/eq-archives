<div id="ygrps-yiv-885830202">Hehe welcome!  <br/>
<br/>
Man I must _really_ suck!  I been playing since April - 6 hours every week<br/>
night and 8 to 12 hours every weekend - ok prolly missed a couple days in<br/>
there.  And i am only lev 24. Well I do got a 13 warrior and a 7 cleric and<br/>
a couple misc 1&#39;s and 2&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
My trouble is - I can&#39;t stand doing the same thing over and over - don&#39;t<br/>
matter if its killing pickclaws or making pottery (before the nerf I tried<br/>
it and was killed by the merch in an accidental auto-attack hehe that was a<br/>
sign from the Gods!)  So I go out and adventure and meet people!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;I have been playing since April and I am only at &gt;level 26<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now so I<br/>
		will be lucky if I hit 50 before &gt;the add-on comes out, so<br/>
with that in<br/>
		mind I have a &gt;long life ahead of my character.<br/>
<br/>
		Yeah. I&#39;m worse off than this. I&#39;ve been a bard since the<br/>
third day of<br/>
		release, and I&#39;m about half way through 15. I play about 3<br/>
hours a day,<br/>
		and not too often on weekends. <br/>
<br/>
		I have noticed something, and I was wondering if anyone has<br/>
experience<br/>
		this, or if it is just my imagination. I regularly group<br/>
with a human<br/>
		ranger, have been since I was level 4. When I group with<br/>
her, I get<br/>
		little to no experience. When I group with other people, I<br/>
get normal<br/>
		experience. We have been grouped, and we&#39;ll be killing<br/>
things that we<br/>
		can kill, and she&#39;ll talk about how her experience is good,<br/>
but I won&#39;t<br/>
		notice much of a difference in my experince. Is she sucking<br/>
my<br/>
		experience dry or what?<br/>
<br/>
		That&#39;s all. I&#39;ll be 16 soon. I am aching to be 17, as I have<br/>
an<br/>
		ashenwood short spear I am dying to dual wield. Too bad my<br/>
piercing<br/>
		stinks now or I would use it now.<br/>
<br/>
		Oh. By the way. I tried to reproduce the &quot;concert&quot; that<br/>
Harmonic<br/>
		Distortion did in Blackburrow. It was pretty fun. Gnolls<br/>
would run to<br/>
		me, and I was standing there playing Lullaby while others<br/>
killed them.<br/>
		(Will the range of Lullaby increase as my level increases?)<br/>
Many people<br/>
		were impressed at how they didn&#39;t have to run to zone like<br/>
they thought<br/>
		they would, but the big ones still broke out of the trance<br/>
and got<br/>
		enough hits on me to make me need to zone. Ah well. This<br/>
song is fun<br/>
		and will continue to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
		May your feet stand firmly on the ground,<br/>
