&gt; I&#39;m only a lowly 22d level bard and have spent most of the past few levels<br/>
&gt; in Unrest.  I don&#39;t think I have ever fought any mob that was buffed with<br/>
&gt; SOW/SOC.  How many types of mobs are we talking about here?  I&#39;m guessing<br/>
&gt; that the only mobs who can cast SOW/SOC are shamans.  How much of an impact<br/>
&gt; is this?  If camping these shaman-type mobs that can cast SOW/SOC are like<br/>
&gt; most of the places I&#39;ve been, as soon as they spawn the campers are all over<br/>
&gt; them.  Do they even have time to cast the SOW buff before they are attacked?<br/>
&gt; As I said earlier I&#39;ve never fought a mob that was buffed with SOW, but I<br/>
&gt; see this as a problem only if they have time to cast their buffs before they<br/>
&gt; are attacked.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The undead aren&#39;t known for a high proportion of shamans. Where this<br/>
does become and issue is permafrost, nagafen&#39;s lair, and guk, both upper<br/>
and lower. I can&#39;t remember if Solusek&#39;s eye and RunnyEye Citadel<br/>
goblins have shamans but I vaguely recall that they do. Blackburrow and<br/>
Paw also feature shamans but by the time you get chains they are<br/>
non-issues I guess. But, I guess the answer to your question is, EVERY<br/>
NON-UNDEAD DUNGEON IN THE GAME.  I guess you might see that this could<br/>
actually cause a bit of a problem for some people.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it might not be a problem in Kedge Keep, but then no one hunts there<br/>
either, as they haven&#39;t got around to itemizing it.<br/>
