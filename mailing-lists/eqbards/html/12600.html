<div id="ygrps-yiv-281309980">Continuously playing Pixie Strike is about the only way to interrupt a<br/>
caster&#39;s song unless maybe you are on a super-high speed connection. By the<br/>
time you get the data from the server indicating that an enemy caster is<br/>
casting a spell it is probably already 1 second into the spell. There is<br/>
also the little bit of delay it takes for the client to send your song<br/>
request to the server.<br/>
	Whenever a group I am in goes up against a caster I usually just switch to<br/>
solid Pixie Striking. Doing this I can interrupt about 80% of the spells on<br/>
average, sometimes the caster doesn&#39;t even get a spell off.<br/>
	As for your Mistmoore experience I have witnessed this. What seems to<br/>
happen is that, since the server is *way* faster than you in processing<br/>
information, it has the NPC start casting the next spell immediately after<br/>
the Pixie Strike hits them (since they are most likely constantly being hit<br/>
by the rest of your group) and the delays I mentioned above in addition to<br/>
the delay we have to restart the song results in them being able to get the<br/>
spell off. Generally I only see this if they weren&#39;t in the middle of a<br/>
spell when the last Pixie Strike hit them.<br/>
	Lastly, a resist will not interrupt their spell. I have seen many of these<br/>
as well. I grin gleefully as it begins to cast a heal, knowing that my song<br/>
is well on its way, only to see the resist message followed shortly by them<br/>
little blue sparklies. :/<br/>

	Good Journey<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Pixie strike versus interrupting spell casters<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After reading on this board that pixie strike can interrupt spell casters<br/>
attempts at casting a spell, I have tried using this song for this purpose.<br/>
When I see the text message that the mob is starting to cast a spell, I<br/>
immediately stop what I&#39;m playing and start up pixie strike.  In just about<br/>
every situation where I have tried this, the mob is still able to<br/>
successfully cast the spell before the pixie strike goes into effect.  How<br/>
have you guys gotten this to work? Do you continuously pixie strike at the<br/>
expense of weaving other songs or is there a better way to time it?  All our<br/>
songs take 3 seconds to go off.  Assuming we start the song as soon as you<br/>
see the message &quot;mob starts casting a spell&quot;, we should be able to interrupt<br/>
any spell that takes 4 second or longer to cast.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, how long does it take for the mob to get a heal spell<br/>
off?  My group was fighting glyphed warders in Mistmoore the other night and<br/>
it kept healing itself, even though I kept trying to pixie strike it.  It<br/>
really irritated me because my strike usually kicked in right after they got<br/>
the heal off.<br/>
<br/>
Also, will pixie strike interrupt a spell even if the mob successfully<br/>
resists?<br/>
