<div id="ygrps-yiv-532822249">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently aquired the much coveted (by me at least) charm song. I&#39;ve<br/>
done some limited experimenting, mostly on very light greens so that I can<br/>
get the hang of it, however I&#39;m finding the timing of this song to be<br/>
something I just can&#39;t grasp.<br/>
<br/>
Generally I select a target, Charm, swtich targets and attack, Selo&#39;s, Hymn,<br/>
they back to charm.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I seem to charm too early every single time, the mob breaks<br/>
charm and I get beat on for a full cycle while I try to get charm going<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of the more experienced bards on the list could offer<br/>
any tips on timing this so that I can start singing charm as the mob is<br/>
about to break out, rather than waiting until I get pounded.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that I&#39;ll need to put in a lot of practice and that it will be<br/>
hard to break the ingrained habit of making sure all my songs overlap. Just<br/>
figured I&#39;d appeal to the list before spending 3 hours in teh newbie area<br/>
perfecting my timing.<br/>
