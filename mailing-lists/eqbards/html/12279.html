<div id="ygrps-yiv-340974649">I&#39;ve been starting to go to hate regularily now.  I play my full range of<br/>
songs, and don&#39;t experience any problems at all.  Mind you, we usually keep<br/>
bards out of the puller&#39;s group, but other than that, I don&#39;t know that we<br/>
do anything special.  One of the recent trips, I didn&#39;t even die once in<br/>
about 10 hours on the plane.<br/>

  I got L50, hit hate, died about 10 times, got imbrued legs, went back<br/>
  to L49 and then now recently have L50 with a 2 bubble buffer.<br/>
<br/>
  I learned one thing from hateplane.  When the puller is pulling, or<br/>
  something is incoming - make sure you arent playing any songs, or <br/>
  a multimob pull will rape you bad.<br/>
<br/>
  I used one song in hate, and that was manasong.  It&#39;s just too easy<br/>
  for mobs to train there, and you are the number one target if they<br/>
  see you playing songs.<br/>
