<b>Subject:</b> New NPC in Highpass? (off-topic & possible spoiler) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-390684678">Apologize beforehand for adding to the increasing number of off topic posts<br/>
on this list but I had an encounter last night with a NPC in Highpass hold<br/>
that I had never seen or heard of before.  I was camping the Mucktail site<br/>
with a level 29 cleric.  While we were waiting, we start to see messages<br/>
scroll through &quot;Cytodl Krish begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Next thing we know we<br/>
get attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard) and<br/>
blue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we both<br/>
had to make a run for the Keep zone.  We fully recharged and went out<br/>
looking for him.  I was singing invis and had elemental and purifying<br/>
ryhthms ready to weave.  We finally found the necro wandering around the<br/>
zone, with a bunch of corpses in his wake.  We attacked at the cleric tried<br/>
rooting him several times. He kept resisting and the cleric was OOM (oops, I<br/>
used an acronym).  We had to run to the border again.  We recharged and<br/>
tracked him down once again.  The second time, the cleric just kept smiting<br/>
him and we eventually killed him.  All told did over 800 damage to him.  He<br/>
didn&#39;t drop any loot which was a disappointment.  When we killed him, the<br/>
factions affected, which all got worse, were The Dead, King and Queen of<br/>
some wierd name, Keepers of the Art, and Eldritch Collective.  After the<br/>
fight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC before.  No<br/>
one in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>
could shed some light on his background?  Also wanted to warn everyone in<br/>
case they ran into him and they were less level 30 they should be prepared<br/>
to run. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, by the way he was acting, almost 100% certain it wasn&#39;t a GM controlled<br/>
NPC.<br/>
