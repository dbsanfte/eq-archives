<div id="ygrps-yiv-797172001">Ok, here is my crazy bug.<br/>
I was boarding on the boat in Butcherblock to Freeport, and practicing my<br/>
Charismatic Carillion with my flute on every npc that I saw. (to improve my<br/>
woodwind skill) and I accidently sang Lagubrious lament, at the friendly<br/>
female dwarf at the end of the dock. She started hitting me really hard and<br/>
I ran around the boat thinking that I would just kick Selo&#39;s in and wait<br/>
till the boat zoned to Ocean of Tears.  Well she knocked me for a loop and<br/>
killed me just about the time that the boat was zoning.  I ran back from<br/>
Kelethin and sang the locating lyric which pointed me roughly southwest out<br/>
toward the middle of the ocean.  Well I have died underwater a few times and<br/>
it stinks but what can you do it was my own damn fault.  I kick in Jaxan&#39;s<br/>
Jig O&#39; Vigor and twist that with the locating lyric.  Following along the<br/>
ocean floor I hit an invisible wall, which I assumed was the edge of the<br/>
zone, and I went along sideways.  I could tell however that it was pointing<br/>
me toward someplace that I could not get to.  I followed the edge around<br/>
untill I everything changed.  Suddenly I wasn&#39;t in the water anymore, but I<br/>
was floating nebulously in dark space.  I could see rain however, and I<br/>
could tell which way was up.  I squirmed around and tried jumping and a few<br/>
other things for about 2 minutes when I suddenly appeared smack dab in the<br/>
middle of Butcherblock, near the crossroads.  Well I ran back to the docks<br/>
again and hopped on the boat and played the Locating Lyric as the boat took<br/>
off.  I could see where my body was(because I was spun around)and I jumped<br/>
off and tried again to find it. Same deal, floating in dark space with rain<br/>
and back in the middle of butcherblock.  I finally had to /pettition even<br/>
though I really hate doing that.  The Guide who came was very nice and he<br/>
told me that my body was &quot;below the world&quot;  Good thing I didn&#39;t have to buy<br/>
all that banded again.<br/>
