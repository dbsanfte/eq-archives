<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; its been a bear to<br/>
&gt; not use it in any professional emails and documents<br/>
&gt; as i have begun to use<br/>
&gt; the subconsciously when i am thinking at the end of<br/>
&gt; a sentence. that along<br/>
&gt; with abreviations. I once told a client over the<br/>
&gt; phone I was going afk..<br/>
&gt; that was quite odd.<br/>
&gt; At any rate enough of the random ramblings of a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really appreciated this post.  I dont know how many<br/>
times in emails at work ive been tempted to use the<br/>
bad typing habits ive picked up in eq and then i have<br/>
to go back and re-write what ive written with proper<br/>
punctuation, capitalization, remove abbreviations and<br/>
(non industry standard) TLA&#39;s (thats Three Letter<br/>
Acronyms, for those of you not at Intel(tm) with a TLA<br/>
dictionary on your desk).<br/>
