<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111489575">Yeah, it&#39;s still a risk that we shouldn&#39;t have to take, if one of those<br/>
bouncers gets a stun on you then you&#39;re dead, especially as there are 2<br/>
outside oggok.<br/>
<br/>
I just think that bind affinity should work in all outsdoor zones (be it a<br/>
city, swamp, desert, commons etc), and there should be a Yes/No box like<br/>
res, this way people can&#39;t bind someone where they don&#39;t want to be bound.<br/>
This would stop people from binding inside dungeons and save peoples time<br/>
if they die.<br/>
<br/>
I come from England and over here we have to pay for our calls, they are<br/>
charged by the minute. Now this soon adds up and when I have to waste time<br/>
running across 6 zones to my corpse I&#39;m gonna be pissed. Aswell as having<br/>
to mem songs and spend an hour getting back the exp I lost. My monthly<br/>
phone bill is roughly ´┐¢100-120, in $ I would probably say it is about<br/>
$150-175 per month. If you had to pay that then I think you&#39;d be<br/>
complaining.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve rambled enough, I don&#39;t want to start a flame war or anything<br/>
just my view on the subject.<br/>

I thought we settled this issue...<br/>
<br/>
bring extra flutes<br/>
bag everything and fill as many main slots with extra flutes as you can<br/>
zone into Ogg<br/>
get binded there<br/>
duel your friend and get killed<br/>
loot every thing except the flutes<br/>
<br/>
Now you have a storage corpse - complete with a night&#39;s supply of flutes.<br/>
Do<br/>
this a few times and you will see that the storage corpse and flute thing<br/>
is<br/>
more of a bother than a help and soon you will either selos or sneak by any<br/>
bouncers that are not camped.<br/>

          I find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the<br/>
Sol&#39;s I have to<br/>
          run all the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to<br/>
my corpse,<br/>
