fear  them,only chaining one and finish the chained one off while the others<br/>
wander (sometimes it takes two tries to get them lost). Sit and heal, then<br/>
wander around a bit until one of the others finds you. If you get more than<br/>
one back, repeat.<br/>
As a side benefit, if one of them was a sarnak he will often pass you on to<br/>
allll the other sarnaks, and you will get faction hits for the rest of the<br/>
night (assuming the fort is under siege). I know what you are thinking, but<br/>
I never got a train back from this strategy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oohhh, the times this has saved my group&#39;s butt, and oooh the times I needed<br/>
it and my last thought before dying was &#39;screech isn&#39;t memmed&quot;...I have<br/>
pretty much decided that if there is a need for an evacer then there is a<br/>
need to have screech and a horn ready.<br/>
