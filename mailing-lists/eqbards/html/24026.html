 </span></blockquote>well you didn&#39;t answer my question, what is &#39;&#39;it&#39;&#39;?  just the mana he used?<br/>
or is that for the entire mana bar?  or is it the same thing for him?<br/>
<br/>
oh and down below, i guess i would only need 24 minutes to cast again, heh.<br/>
<br/>
and as the previous poster said, ht and loh are on &#39;&#39;game day&#39;&#39; timers, i.e. 90 minutes,<br/>
meaning even if you use the 40 minute number you can blow 2 of these off in the space<br/>
of one HT.  now i guess the question is, how much damage does HT do as compared<br/>
to dirge of a bard of the same level?  if it&#39;s around twice as much or slightly higher, then<br/>
it&#39;s essentially the same in single target situations, and ours does far more damage if<br/>
you find good ways to use it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
examples:<br/>
<br/>
fighting 2 mobs, one mezzed, use it to finish off one mob and start off the damage on<br/>
the next one.<br/>
<br/>
pull of 3 or 4 mobs, fire it off to start off the damage and let an enchanter mez singles<br/>
off you once they charge you.<br/>
<br/>
also note that the only opportunity cost is losing the ability to use the 39 charm song<br/>
(which if i believe some of your posts, you NEVER use, since you&#39;re ALWAYS grouped<br/>
with enchanters and they just don&#39;t like it) since you can swap it in and out as your mana<br/>
regens.  you don&#39;t have to waste a song slot with it when you can&#39;t use it.<br/>

&gt;where do you get the 40 minutes thing?  is that how long it takes to med<br/>
&gt;back a full 5 bubbles of mana?  for me dirge only takes 3 bars of mana, so<br/>
&gt;that would be only 24 minutes if i medded back to full, sooner if i just<br/>
&gt;medded<br/>
&gt;back a bubble (altho then i would require the full 40 minutes).<br/>

&gt; &gt;True.  The timer is longer than that on Harmtouch which is practically<br/>
&gt; &gt;irresistible and does far more damage, even if only to a single target.<br/>

&gt; &gt;My problem with this song is the concept.  If this is indeed a &quot;Desperate<br/>
&gt; &gt;Dirge&quot;, that can only be used<br/>
&gt; &gt;once every 40 minutes (the longest timer of any effect in the game, if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;not mistaken), it should, in at<br/>
&gt; &gt;least some small number of expected circumstances, have a significant<br/>
&gt; &gt;effect.  It doesn&#39;t.  By the time<br/>
&gt; &gt;you get it, the amount of damage it does is inconsequential to the eventual<br/>
&gt; &gt;outcome of any fight, and is<br/>
&gt; &gt;actually much more likely to be detrimental due to the AE component (which<br/>
&gt; &gt;wakes up anything mezzed)<br/>
&gt; &gt;coupled with the ludicrous resists (which wakes up anything mezzed,<br/>
&gt; &gt;frequently without damaging them in<br/>
&gt; &gt;the slightest).  And the level increases that Verant gave to this song are<br/>
&gt; &gt;laughably small compared to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;increased HP total of higher-level MOBs.  They really have no clue.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am inconvenienced only in that we were theoretically limited to one<br/>
&gt;song<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; per level and I don&#39;t get one at that level due to 7% of the people.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they add in another song at the level that is useful, problem solved.<br/>
&gt;My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whole point is DDD is pathetic.  Pillar of Frost can be chain cast 7<br/>
&gt;times<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by a 51st level wizard for far more effect.<br/>
