<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843920094">Umm, define Early Beta?  Bard songs affected Group Only in Beta 2 and 3,<br/>
during late Beta 3/early 3.5 bard songs got messed up and affected everyone<br/>
around them (actually a lot of us liked this, made us far more powerful).<br/>
This was a bug, not a design.  Later in 3.5 it was fixed just before we went<br/>
to Beta 4 last February.<br/>
<br/>
However, the reasoning is still the same.  Mobs aggro on us because we are<br/>
buffing everyone in the group.  In addition, every time your song &#39;pulses&#39;<br/>
you are &quot;Casting&quot;.  Mobs HATE casters.  Thus they hate bards, who are<br/>
casters that cast every 3 seconds (when singing a medley) or every 6 seconds<br/>
(maintaining 1 song) and who&#39;s &#39;spells&#39; affect everyone in their group.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt; something it headed right for me even if they started wacking it before<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; arrived to begin pummeling me. Assuming it wasn&#39;t my breath, does anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; else notice this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Manasong has the same effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If the NPC heading your way has not been engaged or taunted sufficiently<br/>
&gt;   any song you play will act as a taunt.  The happens a lot to me in the<br/>
&gt;   Plane of Sky.  Monk pulls a mob, mob comes home and sees me up front<br/>
&gt;   and whacks me once, and then forgets about me the rest of the battle<br/>
&gt;   after it&#39;s taunted and damaged heavier by tanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   This is something that ties to basic design of the Bard class itself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   In early beta, the Bard sang his/her song to everyone around them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If a Bard blew by 6 people medding with selo&#39;s and a selo&#39;s pulse<br/>
&gt;   caught them, they all would stand up and get the &#39;Your feet move<br/>
&gt;   faster&#39; message.  Needless to say, /all/ casters hated bards for<br/>
&gt;   that.  Bard song use to reach everyone in the radius.  Of course<br/>
&gt;   this is not desired.  Thus instead of Verant recoding their engine<br/>
&gt;   to send song signals to just party members, it now sends out a pulse<br/>
&gt;   to everyone and everything in your radius, and then does a check on<br/>
&gt;   the object to see if it&#39;s in your party.  If it is, the effect is<br/>
&gt;   applied, if not the effect is not applied, but it&#39;s not ignored.<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s considered a huge taunt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If I stood in the middle of 40 people and played any song, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;   &#39;helping&#39; 40 people, and I become an increased value target.<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve had things B-line for me out of the blue because of this.<br/>
&gt;   This is also the reason why Bards die so much, or are hated by<br/>
&gt;   NPCs so much - A coding failure on Verant&#39;s part.  Instead of<br/>
&gt;   remedying the base problem, they just patched it.  Usually<br/>
&gt;   taunting and constant attack keeps NPCs off me, but that shift<br/>
&gt;   doesn&#39;t occur until after L25 when tank skills (taunt/offense)<br/>
&gt;   become high enough to overpower my hate rating on the NPC hatelist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Still, I&#39;ll always get tagged right off the bat before any mob is<br/>
&gt;   engaged if I&#39;m playing songs and close enough.  It gets better<br/>
&gt;   as you gain levels however.<br/>
