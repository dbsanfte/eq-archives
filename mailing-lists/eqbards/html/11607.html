You know, now that you mention it, there was a change several<br/>
months ago where you couldn&#39;t cast certain spells on a<br/>
mesmerized mob anymore without waking it up.<br/>

&gt;   you see:  You are stunned.  You are unstunned.  at the same <br/>
&gt;   time?  I would think so.  Or maybe telling an object to stun<br/>
&gt;   for 0 seconds is just skipped since a 0 second stun is obsolete.<br/>
&gt;   That could be, then no messages would display.  But that&#39;s if<br/>
&gt;   the coded it in said way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keep in mind GZ has said that mobs have a chance of breaking<br/>
out of certain spell effects (e.g. root) every round (I&#39;m<br/>
guessing that&#39;s 2.5 seconds).  Pixie Strike and Lullaby would<br/>
definitely fall under that category since they often do not<br/>
last their full duration.  Assuming that&#39;s the case, the 0 sec<br/>
Strike would be:<br/>
<br/>
Strike not resisted<br/>
Stunned<br/>
Roll to see if mob breaks out<br/>
Success - mob breaks out<br/>
Unstunned<br/>
<br/>
So even a 0 second stun on yourself should be accompanied by<br/>
the &quot;You are stunned&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
So it would seem something is just causing the song not to<br/>
work at all, either unrelated to resists, or done via a hidden<br/>
resist check for which we get no messages.<br/>
