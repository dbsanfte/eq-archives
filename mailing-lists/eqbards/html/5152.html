&gt;There is no death in EverQuest, except psychologically.  And I&#39;m dying, I<br/>

&gt;highly intellectual, why I bother you with this damned heavy luggage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bored.  I&#39;m bored.  Thinking of quiting because of it.  Boredom, I imagine,<br/>
&gt;would be probably the worst reason a designer would fear someone would give<br/>
&gt;up on their massive online game like this.  Boredom, really, is almost the<br/>
&gt;worst of an insult.  Someone is angry, that&#39;s better.  They feel something,<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re emotional about it, a love-turned-to-hate kind of thing, acceptable<br/>
&gt;and expected.  But boredom?  Boredom, apathy, that&#39;s a lack of everything<br/>
&gt;good.  That would be scarry, at least if I were a developer, and that&#39;s<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am: not a developer but bored.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ah well, but boredom has it&#39;s good sides.  It&#39;s a slower kind of emotion,<br/>
&gt;lets you think.  When you&#39;re bored, you&#39;re less apt to just quit outright,<br/>
&gt;and instead ponder why, in fact, you ARE bored.  So I&#39;ve thought on it, and<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s off-topic but I couldn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass but I&#39;m posting it here<br/>
&gt;because this is the only discussion area I&#39;ve found where maybe someone<br/>
&gt;could say something, anything, though I somehow doubt it would help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>EQ is a game with limited shelf life in it&#39;s current state.  Everyone says,<br/>
&quot;How can you say that, this is a MMORPG!&quot;  I say it because this is the most<br/>
limited and dull MMORPG or MUD I have ever played.  The AI is horrid and<br/>
unless you are on a PvP server combat is nothing but a dingy camp fest.<br/>
Yup, what fun is going to a dungeon and sitting in a corner for a couple<br/>
hours?  Please, in my PnP RPGs never once as a PC did I ever sit in one<br/>
place, (Well, cept the time we found an Ogre princess, but the DM was high<br/>
during that game so nothing was normal.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;* It runs deep, I think.  There is no wandering.  Everyone stays put.<br/>
&gt;Camping is a problem, everyone says, and we have all these solutions<br/>
&gt;suggested and implemented.  But, mmmm, none will work!  Camping is central<br/>
&gt;to EverQuest!  Everyone camps!  Everywhere!  Been to Unrest?  How else do<br/>
&gt;you survive there but &quot;camp the wall?&quot;  These people aren&#39;t camping for<br/>
&gt;items, but just to play.  Folks camp every dungeon, every outdoor zone.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been to West Karanas and watched folks pulling lions to the wall.  And<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s the same everywhere else.  Was suggested by a friend, since I so<br/>
&gt;loathed camping, to play the south Karanas.  I am currently &quot;camped&quot; there<br/>
&gt;now, because that&#39;s all anyone does in such an outdoor zone as well!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brad loves this story and insists that because of this we must have static<br/>
stuff.  Now if the story actually unfolded and you go past the first chapter<br/>
it would be nice, since things would change.  Thing&#39;s aren&#39;t changing and<br/>
show no sign of ever changing.  Why was Diablo a massive classic?  Even<br/>
though the AI wasn&#39;t hot, nor was the story that great, the dungeon always<br/>
changed and you never knew what you were going to get.  Why do I compare EQ<br/>
to Diablo instead of another RPG?  There is no comparison of EQ to another<br/>
RPG, it blows EQ away.  Why not compare a CRPG to EQ?  Because they are so<br/>
different they are in different geners.  The closest type of game to EQ are<br/>
PnP RPGs and it can&#39;t compare to them.  :(<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think the whole problem is that you don&#39;t regenerate fast enough, as a<br/>
bard, people must think I am nuts, but I honestly think somehting in game<br/>
should allow people to regain HPs at a rate where they are able to go into a<br/>
dungeon without camping.  At this time it is impossible, even though a<br/>
fighter can be healed when a caster meds in the middle of a dungeon he is<br/>
toaste.  Allow potions of healing at a reasonable cost that are worth it!  I<br/>
would pay a plat for a potion of healing and 5 plat for a potion of greater<br/>
healing, and 10 plat for a potion of complete healing.  At those prices no<br/>
one would be able to just buy so many that a cleric isn&#39;t needed, they would<br/>
for emergencys and to aid in dungeon diving.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No regeneration of mana either.  I know there&#39;s no real-world counter-part,<br/>

&gt;created out of thin air.  It needs a source....  The soul I always assumed,<br/>
&gt;but that can only supply so much.  So I say any mana user must find a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of their mana and cast a spell, a place where they take their mana from.<br/>
&gt;That UFO in Qeynos would be a good place.  But at higher levels, I say<br/>
&gt;better places to find where one can channel mana from.  When one needs more<br/>
&gt;mana, they must teleport there, at least in spirit, through a complex<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Enough with everyone sitting on their duffs.  Burn mana in a battle, run<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;hope you&#39;re not chased to find a private spot to channel spirit spell to<br/>
&gt;regain all your lost mana.  I want the game to require people to be on THE<br/>
&gt;MOVE and not encourage them to sit around like they&#39;re lazy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My potion idea works on mana too, but make mana potions cheaper, this would<br/>
make it so casters would need less time spent staring at their spell books<br/>
and more time having fun.  Heck, tone down all spells if you want, so the<br/>
damage per time stays the same, but make it FUN!  Staying in the fight<br/>
instead of staring at a spell book is much more enjoyable.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;*  AI lacking.  In a massively multiplayer game it should be better,<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;* The story is too static.  One of Brad McQuaid&#39;s problems with adding<br/>

&gt;camping anyway because that&#39;s all they ever do.  But back to the story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The story, is, rather interesting.  But this is not the story for a<br/>
&gt;massively online roleplaying game.  This is the story for a single player<br/>
&gt;game!  Let&#39;s take, for example, the story of Crushbone.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem.  That courier is always delivering notes, ambassador Dvinn will<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;does, the NPCs will always be locked in that moment, regardless what level<br/>

&gt;Everything is the same.  It always has been, always will.  McQuaid wants<br/>
&gt;people to appreciate where items come from plotwise, when they buy them or<br/>
&gt;find them.  Yet I&#39;m afraid those subtlties are lost when it&#39;s always that<br/>
&gt;same NPC in that same place, and they never change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;:An ever evolving NPC plot, entirely dependent on PC action!   How does the<br/>
&gt;plot unfold?  Almost like voting.  The most PCs to do the most quests one<br/>

&gt;Why is there a &quot;Rescue the Princess&quot; quest where the princess can never<br/>

UO and how much fun that was, or other things along that nature.  I was part<br/>
of a guild that would write many books and leave them around.  Not stupid or<br/>
junky stuff, we would write actual stories and things like that.  Me and<br/>
three other people wrote a small series called &quot;The Travels of Dentharous&quot;.<br/>
Who knows if anyone saw them, but it was still fun.  I loved looking at<br/>

prolly quit when D2 comes out, if it&#39;s as good as D1.  I mean, the combat<br/>
will be FAR better, and the loot and dungeons never grow old.  It is always<br/>
new every time.<br/>
