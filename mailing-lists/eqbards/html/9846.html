&gt; this is not what i notice.  chain will only stop a mob once it is very low<br/>

health.  One in particular I stopped, the poor newbie fighting<br/>
it didn&#39;t understand what had happened and continued to<br/>
&quot;chase&quot; it down the ramp.  I held it there for about a half<br/>
minute, when it healed to above 50% and slowly wandered off.<br/>
So maybe there is more to it.<br/>

(Yeah I was in Blackburrow at level 40.  Trumpy and some other<br/>
NPC saw my cleric friend through a wall and attacked her while<br/>
I was playing Clarity, and the subsequent faction hits dropped<br/>
me to where the Qeynos merchants wouldn&#39;t sell to me anymore.  <br/>
Mind you, they used to be amiable to me before the Cazic bug<br/>
dropped me back to apprehensive with them.)<br/>
