<div id="ygrps-yiv-811634790"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; True, but the root problem we were trying to solve was the<br/>
&gt; attractiveness of camping compared to crawling.  Nobody was<br/>
&gt; trying to address high levels killing low level stuff until<br/>
&gt; you brought it up.  Like I said, the pro-crawling solutions we<br/>
&gt; came up with work - even your L50s in a L20 dungeon are<br/>
&gt; crawling instead of camping.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  I thought the thread was entitled &quot;My overcrowding solution&quot; which<br/>
entalled crawling instead of camping :-).<br/>
<br/>
Again, I stand by my previous point.  Until you get the l50 out of the l30<br/>
dungeon and until everyone has someplace to hunt or something to do, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter if you are crawling or camping.</div>
