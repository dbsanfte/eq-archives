&gt; Yes, most bard skills are capped at 40. I did not know about h2h(damm<br/>
&gt; wanted to train in that too), but 2handers are capped at 1, tracking at<br/>
&gt; 1, forage at 40, pick lock at 40, hide at 40, sneak at 40, disarm traps<br/>
&gt; at 40. Safe fall, instill doubt, and bind wound are probably too. Corect<br/>
&gt; me if I&#39;m wrong. The only thing we aren&#39;t capped in are the basic weapon<br/>
&gt; skills(cept mentioned), instrument and singing skills, dual wield,<br/>
&gt; offense and defense, (though it seems to be 5 pts behind your level,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d think bind wound wound be capped near the max (200?) since<br/>
every class gets the skill.  Here&#39;s a quote from a post that<br/>
came across this list a while back.  Dunno what hand to hand<br/>
is capped at, but would guess that it&#39;s not the max or else<br/>
we&#39;d be as good as monks at H2H.  :-)<br/>
