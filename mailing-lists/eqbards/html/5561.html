<div id="ygrps-yiv-900655469"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; city in the game!) so I&#39;m familiar with Nektulos. I&#39;m<br/>

&gt; guards are going to be.  Heh<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, answered my own question last night.. <br/>
<br/>
A. Stone Guardians for my level 17 are blue, but hit hard.<br/>
B. Stone Guardians have friends. And lots of them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s got to be fairly amusing seeing this little half-elf<br/>
in Nektulos kiting 7 stone guardians and a few pesky<br/>
skeletons..<br/>
<br/>
Lavastorm was nice, but would be much better with a second<br/>
person or even a group. The Fire Imp&#39;s and their heat spells<br/>
just do too much damage to me. Elemental Rhythms proved to<br/>
be useless in my opinion. (Or whichever rhythms is the <br/>
fire/cold one - I checked before going, but don&#39;t remember<br/>
now) Am I doing something wrong? Or are the rhythm songs<br/>
only good when you&#39;re playing an instrument? (Thus making<br/>
them useless while soloing.)</div>
