<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301377650">sorry i don&#39;t see the connection.  i advocate not letting melee/hybrid<br/>
classes to be able to bind, making the game harder.  how does that make it<br/>
easier to &quot;win&quot; or have anything to do with what you said?<br/>
<br/>
no one likes dying, not just some folks.  that&#39;s the point, it is bad to<br/>
die.  if there were no consequences, there would be no challenge.  is this<br/>
what you are referring to, my point of the game being a challenge?  this has<br/>
nothing to do with wanting to win, it has only to do with wanting to have<br/>
fun, and not being bored.  it is after all a game, and if you are not having<br/>
fun, you shouldn&#39;t be playing.<br/>

&gt; Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is <br/>
&gt; enough of a<br/>
&gt; penalty, thank you very much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is where the paradigm falls back to singlemindset games <br/>
&gt; - that there<br/>
&gt; has to be a way to &#39;keep score&#39; - that puts the emphasis on <br/>
&gt; advancement and<br/>
&gt; competition with others - instead of living in the world, and <br/>
&gt; working with<br/>
&gt; others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You cannot &#39;win&#39; in a persistent world - nor should the goals be<br/>
&gt; artificially propped up to encourage that attitude.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of EQs major shortcomings - is there is a perceived <br/>
&gt; &#39;end&#39;. Games - read<br/>
&gt; &#39;worlds&#39; of this nature are going to have to mature past the <br/>
&gt; singleplayer<br/>
&gt; game mindset baggage they have towed along with them, for <br/>
&gt; these worlds to<br/>
&gt; truly reach their full potential. </span></blockquote></div>
