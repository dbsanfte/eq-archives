<div id="ygrps-yiv-414262302">Anyone have any recent experience with lullaby?  I was looking at the song<br/>
analysis and it indicated that lullaby didn&#39;t effect more then 4 targets.<br/>
About a week back my party got ambushed in East Karana by a bunch of spirit<br/>
stalkers while my party was engaging undead reavers (3 of them).  I struck<br/>
up lullaby with my lute and sure enough, I got 10 head nods messages (7<br/>
stalkers and all 3 undead reavers).  There was so much chaos so I&#39;m not sure<br/>
if it took or not, but it at least allowed us enough freedom to dispatch of<br/>
the gnolls and then eventually the stalkers.  I definitely felt like more<br/>
then 4 were really sleeping...<br/>
