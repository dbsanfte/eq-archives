<b>Subject:</b> Song Timer  (was RE: [eqbards] twisting 5, added note) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785748324">Missed notes & stuns (I still tank alot) are why I started liking.  I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten so used to it that I still use it for regular twisting (ie 3 songs).<br/>
In fact, I&#39;ve turned bard songs off.<br/>
<br/>
*quickly ducks as the flames shoot overhead*<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, for 3 songs, going by the timer is easy.  Plus I&#39;m seeing that<br/>
much more of the group/guild chat & tells.  I turn bard songs back on when<br/>
I want to twist 4 though.  Old habits die hard, I guess.<br/>

The song timer has improved my missed note detection.  The big box<br/>
disappearing too soon after starting a song is easier to spot than the line<br/>
in the chat box, and the gems resetting, especially when a lot of things<br/>
are<br/>
happening on the screen.  Other than keeping half an eye on it for that<br/>
reason, I try to not rely on it.  Overall, it&#39;s not that big a deal, to me.<br/>
