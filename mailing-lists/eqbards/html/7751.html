continues to be bad if you use Lullaby liberally after L15.<br/>
Starting at L20, it starts to ease off as the other melee<br/>
classes start getting their damage bonuses and extra attacks.<br/>
At L25 the problem was pretty much gone for me, and I was<br/>
actually having to use certain taunt songs (usually Chain) to<br/>
get stuff off the tanks to attack me to better distribute the<br/>
damage.  I spent Saturday night in Sol B at L35, and between<br/>
me, an enchanter, two tanks, a druid, and a monk, I was taking<br/>
the least damage.<br/>
<br/>
As you advance, you will find the taunt ability of the<br/>
different classes shifting as the amounts of damage, new<br/>
spells/songs, and different situations all change the<br/>
dynamics.  Most of the discussion among the L30+ people in my<br/>
guild lately has been about this in fact.  We were having<br/>
problems with multi-mob pulls, and the puller coming in<br/>
damaged.  The cleric would heal the puller, and all the extra<br/>
mobs would come close to killing the cleric before the<br/>
enchanter could mes the extras.  At these levels, the damage<br/>
the mobs do, and thus the hatred the cleric earns by healing<br/>
the puller, far exceeds the taunt of even your area effect<br/>
songs, at least for a few rounds.  Our solution was to have<br/>
the paladin (who at L39 gets the 300 point greater heal) heal<br/>
the puller, so the extra mobs all attack him.  It&#39;s worked<br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, because each class&#39; taunting ability is constantly<br/>
changing, you have to keep experimenting with different songs<br/>
and combinations, to figure out just where the &quot;edge&quot; is so<br/>
you can keep the mobs off you, or pull them off another party<br/>
member who&#39;s taking too much damage.  That&#39;s actually one<br/>
reason I like charm so much - it wipes the hate list so if I<br/>
charm something, unless someone nearby is almost dead, the mob<br/>
*will* attack me.  I can almost always use it to pull a mob<br/>
off someone.<br/>
