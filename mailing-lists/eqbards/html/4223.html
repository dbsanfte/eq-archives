<div id="ygrps-yiv-849494405">I hate the acronyms too.  I&#39;m not in the U.S. Military, here.  I have no<br/>
idea what a RTS is, real time strategy?  I have probably heard the<br/>
definition of it, and forgotten.  If a salesman pitches me his products in a<br/>
lingo that I don&#39;t understand, it is a bad sales pitch, and I won&#39;t be<br/>
buying anything from him.  He lost a sale.  At worse, the language barrier<br/>
might get either of us killed.<br/>
<br/>
SoWing over to RV from FP because a HRU is going to TD me a BBC for an ABC<br/>
and I have to have my NBC and CBS handy.  Bah!  Speak english for crying out<br/>
loud!  I spend enough time learning other features of the game without<br/>
having to memorize vocabulary lists at night.<br/>
