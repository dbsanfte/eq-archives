<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486735803">Yeah, this makes sense. Plus, let&#39;s think about it this way..<br/>
<br/>
The upgrade is likely going to add many new zones, even continents, along<br/>
with a couple of races, maybe a class or two. Now, who&#39;s going to really<br/>
WANT the expansion badly? Probably those who have invested days of time<br/>
into their characters and want something new to do! Imagine the outcry if<br/>
Verant said &quot;OK, we&#39;re going to upgrade Xegony but not Fennin Ro, and<br/>
Bristlebane but not Tarew Marr?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Or, if they created an entirely new server with the upgrade, then what?<br/>
We&#39;ve wasted several months developing characters that are suddenly<br/>
obsolete, as far as new things are concerned?<br/>
<br/>
Nah, I have to agree here that Verant certainly has to find a way to slip<br/>
the new features right into the existing servers. I&#39;ll have no problem<br/>
paying $20  for a couple of new continents, and horsies! Wheee!<br/>

&gt;Nope, they will require us all to upgrade. That way their devel. team keeps<br/>
&gt;going in a straight line. </span></blockquote></div>
