<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865763904">sure dying from an SG or griffin sucks,  but every time you are deliberately<br/>
fighting something, and things go bad, or its really close, or you pulled<br/>
too much, etc. etc. etc. and you get that excited/scared feeling in your<br/>
stomach, and your heart starts pounding...<br/>
<br/>
think you&#39;ll ever get that with no penalties for dying?  why would you?  no<br/>
dying penalties=no challenge=no fun.<br/>

&gt; &gt;:Also, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There does?  When and where did this ridiculous idea get <br/>
&gt; started? </span></blockquote></div>
