&gt;One thing I find ridiculous - I believe that a lot of our &quot;nerfs&quot; came about<br/>
&gt;because of other players complaining about bards being too powerful.  The<br/>
&gt;mana component of the higher-level charm song for example - came when (IIRC)<br/>
&gt;a Druid started ranting about bards taking all the Giants in Rathe Mountain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve noticed now more and more Druids doing the &quot;Quad Kiting&quot; tactic - of<br/>
&gt;kiting 4 mobs at once.  Whets unbalanced for a bard is perfectly acceptable<br/>
&gt;for a Druid...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah they get to kill 4 mobs at once.  then they med for 15-20 minutes.  bards never<br/>
had to do this when charm didn&#39;t have a mana cost.  there was absolutely no downtime<br/>
for bards who knew what they were doing when charming.  let&#39;s try to compare apples<br/>
to apples here.<br/>
