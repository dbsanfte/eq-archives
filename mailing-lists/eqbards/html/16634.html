 </span></blockquote>18 seconds is plenty.  Even if everyone is already at max<br/>
haste, the double damage would make it equivalent to 36<br/>
seconds of normal combat.  Most fights typically last 1-2<br/>
minutes so worst case, you&#39;re cutting the total fight time by<br/>
about 12%-25%.  Best case, if people only have your normal<br/>
song haste (figure about 20%), then the 18 seconds will be<br/>
equivalent to about 60 seconds of normal combat, which is<br/>
cutting total fight time by 25%-50%.<br/>
