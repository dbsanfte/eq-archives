Blazing Hearts/Avanguardia de Valorian (basically one guild)<br/>
Ethereal Vortex/Last Alliance (maybe)<br/>
<br/>
Those are daytime guilds that most of us don&#39;t see very often... EV/LA get<br/>
included in my book simply because EV used to be up there with the other<br/>
big guilds, and have been around much longer than OBS, Storm, or Unbidden.<br/>
But, if you just count number of people, including EV would include a<br/>
whole new tier of guilds (a la Justifiers, Technique)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LoD has 50 active members or so.  We&#39;re actually one of the smaller<br/>
guilds.  And for what it&#39;s worth, we haven&#39;t considered ourselves the<br/>
uberguild on the server for quite some time.  We get called that by other<br/>
guilds alot more than we refer to ourselves as that :P.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I think Innoruuk has it good.  The top 6 or 7 guilds are close<br/>
enough that alot of stuff is done by consensus and we don&#39;t have anyone<br/>
doing any of the things that FoH is accused of doing on a consistent<br/>
basis.  Sure, every guild (OBS and LoD included) tries to pull a stunt now<br/>
and then, but no one really cares in the long run, cause no one really has<br/>
a monopoly on anything.<br/>
