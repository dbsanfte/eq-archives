<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-229384101">Many people seem to discount the value of delay when it comes to choosing a <br/>
weapon.  Ever since obtaining dual weild I have used two dwarven axes and <br/>
let me tell you I&#39;m a friggin cuisinart.  I regularly group with a Ranger <br/>
who dual weilds a whip and a combine LS.  I ALWAYS end up tanking when I <br/>
play anthem (this is with the ranger casting spells as well).  The ranger <br/>
can&#39;t taunt anything off me for more than a couple of rounds.  I recently <br/>
obtained a Pugius dagger (very nice!) and have been unable to sell my spare <br/>
dwarven axe.  Most people prefer to stick with the heavy...slow mino axe.  I <br/>
try and tell them the dwarven axe is lighter and faster...but they hear its <br/>
dam is 6 and usually turn their noses up at it.  If only they knew...<br/>
<br/>
If you see me on the Rathe and want an axe...give me a tell and I&#39;ll give <br/>
you a deal :)<br/>

&gt;Sure I have read everlore, eqvault, harpers, etc. but as much as I had read<br/>
&gt;what the effects of Anthem de Arms was, I was never able to guage if the<br/>
&gt;weapons speed increase was really working. Part of the problem was that I<br/>
&gt;use a Mino axe, (very heavy, long delay) and most of the people that I <br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt;with are also using mino axes, or equally heavy/slow weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night I grouped with a rogue double wielding daggers. I have never <br/>
&gt;seen<br/>
&gt;someone hit so hit a mob so many times in my life. It was almost comical.<br/>
