<div id="ygrps-yiv-9069994">I know its the same dialog.  But wondering if Metalla has been spotted in MM<br/>
as the writer suggests.  She could have been a recent addition, and if so. .<br/>

Hmm,<br/>
<br/>
That is the same old dialog from Vahlen as always.  Never saw any of the<br/>
NPC&#39;s mentioned.  If you ask about song &quot;what new composition&quot; (??) he gives<br/>
you some clues about the hermit and the winds of karana quest.  I never<br/>
found any further connections to Mistmoore.<br/>

p.s. Fabian??? anyone?  any clues? these (troll gut) lute strings are<br/>
starting to really stink up my backpack!</div>
