<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248492359">There are several in the works now.  Shadowbane I believe is very close.<br/>
Lord of the Rings is far from - if it will ever - be released.  The company<br/>
that holds the long term development (I think it&#39;s Sierra owned by EA) has<br/>
wasted three years. - laying off the entire development team and trying to<br/>
start again.<br/>
Horizons showed a lot of promise - but the management of the company was<br/>
completely incompetent - and their best developers quit in frustration.<br/>
They went bankrupt and were bought by NCSoft that will hopefully have a good<br/>
product some time in the future.  They have been pretty tight lipped - but<br/>
evidently are concentrating on developing the engine.<br/>
NCSoft produces the largest MMORPG in the world.  In typical American<br/>
arrogance - we talk about EQ being the biggest because we only look at our<br/>
market But their BloodPledge game has 2.7 million subscribers.  That&#39;s not a<br/>
typo or a mistake.  Those are almost all in Asia and they only recently<br/>
started marketing in the US market.  They hired Richard Garriot who&#39;s<br/>
heading up the US arm of the company.<br/>
The upcoming 200-pound gorilla of the MMORPG market will also be released by<br/>
Verant - sometime this year.  You may have heard of it - it&#39;s called Star<br/>
Wars Galaxies<br/>
