&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Selling to Krak?<br/>
&gt;Date: Thu, 3 Feb 2000 09:01:56 -0600<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night I tried to sell to Krak, the vendor at the top of the Aviak<br/>
&gt;village in SK. I conned dubious at first and he told me nicely where the<br/>
&gt;exit was. Carillon, with flute or without, would not raise my faction above<br/>
&gt;dubious, and did not change his response. With sneak I got him to<br/>
&gt;indifferent, but he still wouldn&#39;t sell. His response was different, <br/>
&gt;though,<br/>
&gt;saying that he doesn&#39;t talk to Half-Elves, much less sell to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I may have lost faction a while back when someone pulled Krak down to the<br/>
&gt;ramp and I whacked on him before I knew who he was. Think I was still in <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;zone when he died.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can still sell to centaurs, so no worries. Just curious about others&#39;<br/>
&gt;experience with Krak boy and Carillon not doing anything.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You would sing carillon first before sneaking.  The faction bonus it <br/>
&gt;gives<br/>
&gt; &gt; lasts until you zone. You then either activate illusion or sneak.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; almost 100% certain the illusion will give you a better /con than <br/>
&gt;sneaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; so thats the best way to go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m pretty sure sneaking just sets you to indifferent with a<br/>
&gt;merchant regardless of faction (it&#39;s really a bug that you can<br/>
&gt;use it at all to shop).  So if illusion+song results in higher<br/>
&gt;than indifferent faction, it will be better than<br/>
&gt;sneak+anything else.<br/>
