I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts about keeping all your skills maxed so you don&#39;t <br/>
pay for it later on and this seems like sound advice. My question is how do <br/>
you do it? I have switched off between 1H slash, 1H blunt, pierce and HtoH <br/>
and now I am back about 15 points from my cap on all of them. I level before <br/>
I can get even one of them up to my cap. Will this change as leveling gets <br/>
harder or am I &#39;chasing the goose&#39;? Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
