1. Party Bind<br/>
We did not want a bind song if it was identical to casters, however if the <br/>
song allowed you to bind anyone anyplace (melees included) then with spell <br/>
reagent costs and mana tolls, we would certainly welcome it, especially at <br/>
higher (51+) levels since expansion zones are rumored to be mammoth in <br/>
scale.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I don&#39;t think, granted that we&#39;re getting at level 51+ a song which <br/>
duplicates the spell every caster gets by level 14, that this mana cost and <br/>
reagent are justified.  How often will you USE a party-bind song at 51+ <br/>
level?  I haven&#39;t even bothered getting bound in about 5 levels now, at 44 -<br/>
<br/>
and I could get bound any night of the week.  There are always casters who <br/>
can cast bind (with our clarity their downtime is minimal), so this song has<br/>
<br/>
very limited use at best - it can be hard to find people to bind you, but as<br/>
<br/>
you increase in level you make more and more friends, and this hasn&#39;t <br/>
troubled me in 30 levels.  It&#39;s low on my list of desirable songs, and the <br/>
mana cost and reagent seem excessive.  Unless we can also gate, binding is <br/>
NOT a big deal, and of the two gate is 300 times moe useful.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
The only comment I have is that if this was a bind whole group anywhere it<br/>
would be very useful, though more appropriate perhaps for one of the missing<br/>
songs rather than 51+<br/>
