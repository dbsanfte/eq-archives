 </span></blockquote>well it was Kithicor until a few days ago, I had come from Crushbone after<br/>
buying my D-Dirk and paid 5gp to be bound in Freeport.  I then ran to join<br/>
one of my friends in HighHold Pass and promptly died at the hands of an orc<br/>
train.  Unfortunately, I showed up back at the entrance to Crushbone naked<br/>
and with by bank account empty.  So now my choice is any zone that is more<br/>
than 4 zones and a boat ride away from my bind point!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; most number of deaths getting a corpse back;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>3 last night I was attempting to retirieve my corpse from Lesser Faydark<br/>
after being obliterated by an unknown thing.  The unknown thing turned out<br/>
to be Mina something or other, a named fairie which proceeded to kill me and<br/>
my 2 companions 3 more times before we reached our corpses.<br/>

P.S. How do you do the biography thing?</div>
