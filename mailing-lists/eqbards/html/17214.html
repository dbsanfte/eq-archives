<div id="ygrps-yiv-259470069">Nah, my bard is a tailor.  By the time patchwork became trivial I was only<br/>
failing half the time, making it about a break even skill.  Made more money<br/>
fishing, which she still does since she&#39;s always forage fishing grubs.  <br/>
<br/>
My rogue, also level 10, is just starting her tailoring skill.  Doubt she&#39;ll<br/>
have any more luck money wise, but I hope to at least complete the set she&#39;s<br/>
wearing.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s a server by server thing.  How much do people want per piece of<br/>
banded on your server?<br/>

&gt; Hehe, my rogue on Tallon Zek (who I just made 2 nights ago) <br/>
&gt; is level 6,<br/>
&gt; completely un-twinked.  Has full leather armor, a Giant Snake <br/>
&gt; Fang and is<br/>
&gt; starting to buy her banded already.  What you&#39;re doing wrong <br/>
&gt; is not using<br/>
&gt; trade skills ;)  Some of them are profitable even for NPC&#39;s <br/>
&gt; ;)  I can make<br/>
&gt; almost 5 platinum an hour with my rogue ;)  (at level 6 <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not bad at<br/>
&gt; all ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Trade skills ;)  Specifically:  Tailoring ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So you&#39;re level 10, untwinked, and wearing BANDED???  What <br/>
&gt; am I doing<br/>
&gt; wrong?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good job helping that other bard out.  He must have been <br/>
&gt; twinked to get to<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 10 playing only one song.  Weaving&#39;s all that&#39;s kept <br/>
&gt; me alive many<br/>
&gt; &gt; times over.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious he was twinked.  Here was this level 10 wood elf <br/>
&gt; bard, dressed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; head to toe in bronze.  I gave him the gauntlets, and he very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; graciously<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gave me his old bronze gauntlets. :)  They look nice on <br/>
&gt; Adagia, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think they are too heavy, I&#39;ll probably just stick to <br/>
&gt; banded for now.<br/>
