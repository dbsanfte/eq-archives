<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059746079">Fear works great in Kunark for the reason you just stated.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
fighting a lot recently in the Overthere using the chains/fear trick (or<br/>
snare if a ranger or druid in the group).  If the group gets more than one<br/>
mob, the 2d mob without the chains (or snare) almost always never comes back<br/>
when the fear runs off.  I&#39;ll go so far as to say that the best possible<br/>
party in the Overthere (for maximum EXP gain) is a bard, ranger and a rogue.<br/>
Ranger snares, bard fears and the rogue backstabs out the ying yang.  The<br/>
mobs go down quick and hardly anyone takes any damage.  <br/>

In Kunark if you use AE Fear you can actually fear the mobs so far away that<br/>
they don&#39;t come back.  FUN method of crowd control if a pull gets out of<br/>
hand.  Snare what you&#39;re fighting then fire off Fear.  Everything else runs<br/>
away at mach speed and usually doesn&#39;t come back because it runs outside<br/>
it&#39;s chase radius.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t used it much because I&#39;m waiting word from a GM on whether it&#39;s<br/>
legal (I suspect he&#39;ll say it&#39;s fine as long as you don&#39;t relog to clear the<br/>
hate list.  Could be an awesome tool for zoneline fighting though ;)<br/>
