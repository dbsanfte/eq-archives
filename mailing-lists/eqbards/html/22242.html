<br/>
Here is a link to the spreadsheet. Not sure how correct it is - especially<br/>
56 and up - but it should be close.<br/>

I do still like playing my bard at 54 but my time is now divided between a<br/>
53 Cleric, 51 Enchanter, and some miscellaneous lower level characters (34<br/>
Wiz, 23 Ench, 12 Clr, 8 Rogue).  Most of the time, I play on 2 PC&#39;s side by<br/>
side.  Lately, doing mostly guild events killing various epic mobs: General<br/>
4 times, Big Ele a few times, the Monk skelly in LIO for the first time this<br/>
week, swimming in the big lava crater last week, etc.<br/>
<br/>
According to that spreadsheet:<br/>
<br/>
58 HEF Bard gets 72% <br/>
49 HIE Pally gets 28%<br/>
<br/>
But remember that the 49 Pally needs lots less exp points to fill his bubs -<br/>
so to him it could look like he is getting &quot;more&quot; exp. E.g.: they kill 200<br/>
mobs and pally gets 2 bubs while bard gets half a bub.  Who got &quot;more&quot; exp?<br/>

Thank you thank you Sylly!!<br/>
<br/>
Are you still playing your bard much?<br/>
<br/>
I would love the spreadsheet if someone has it please :).<br/>

Who is having a very serious discussion with her paladin husband about<br/>
whether there is a minor or more severe experience split discrepancy in a<br/>
group between a 49th level and a 58th level person, and is getting cold hard<br/>
data to back her up ;)<br/>
