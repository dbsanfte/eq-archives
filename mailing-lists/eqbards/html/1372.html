&gt;no i mean they dont actually have a faction that they&#39;d belong to...that<br/>
&gt;would most certainly compliment the faction theory...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just bought the song and have yet to try it out. I understand faction and <br/>
all. I was wondering about npc&#39;s with no faction standing (say a bat, or a <br/>
wasp for example - I would also think even Mistmoore Gargoyles fall under <br/>
this category), if you use the song on something that is &quot;ready to attack&quot;, <br/>
does it make the creature &quot;indifferent&quot; or &quot;apprehensive&quot;?? Or does it only <br/>
work on npc&#39;s with faction ratings? It would be cool to be able to walk into <br/>
an evil city using this song, kinda like an evil enchanter could disguise <br/>
him/herself and walk into Freeport.<br/>
