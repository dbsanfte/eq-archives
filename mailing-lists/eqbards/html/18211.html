<div id="ygrps-yiv-746550338">not that they aren&#39;t very nice, but the new singing steel bard armor so far<br/>
has been AC only with no stats.  the boots are only AC 18, and gauntlets<br/>
were found that are only AC 14, with no stats.  i&#39;m in the mood for some new<br/>
unique weapons, but i will probably keep in my full set of imbrued cause<br/>
looks always come first over stats! =)  plus with the exp being so slow,<br/>
i&#39;ve got enough to worry about than getting another ste of armor, ugh!<br/>

&gt; friend (another bard) got a pair of AC18 bard<br/>
&gt; only boots plus some stats that are the same color as the <br/>
&gt; hero bracer out of Kunar Castle :-) </span></blockquote></div>
