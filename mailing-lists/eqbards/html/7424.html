<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538964531"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;If you agree with me that there<br/>
&gt;is a possibility, however small, that Verant will change their minds on the<br/>
&gt;binding issue, would you vote in favor or against the petition? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would vote for it.  By keeping it high enough, making getting the spell a<br/>
bard only quest (make all the components no drop/lore), adding a reagent<br/>
that needs to be made into something else by a high level player trademen<br/>
(ala the rat pie in oppula), making the components needed zone specific (you<br/>
have a rat pie you can bind in freeport, but not in N. Ro that needs spider<br/>
ale), and adding in Group Exp loss equivalent to one death, and making it so<br/>
the Bard can only do it once every 2-3 days, then Hell Yes I would vote for<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a bitch to get bound, but it would be possible.</div>
