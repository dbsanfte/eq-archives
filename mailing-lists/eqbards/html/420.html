<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134598776">Actually dear friend, mead is used like water. I tested this by buying only<br/>
mead instead of water and it worked as well. Mead seemed to last longer.<br/>
I.e. ! bottle of water lasts as long as the reg. rations, Mead lasts as long<br/>
as the iron ration. so you can buy water with rations, or mead with iron<br/>
rations for supplies. I feel that mead lasts longer than water... But I<br/>
leave it to others to speculate, for I am very cheap date..<br/>

&gt; With my spiked collar I have only 88 strength, shall keep it I shall.  I<br/>
&gt; have decided that now is the time to journey down that road which is<br/>
&gt; alchohol dependency, for I think one day along my route I shall<br/>
&gt; be wearing a<br/>
&gt; few plate items.  I consider the effect on strength may be quite<br/>
&gt; beneficial<br/>
&gt; with a high tolerance for the stuff.  Anyone else an experienced<br/>
&gt; alchoholic?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (I can just see myself one day constantly overloaded, and only lifting my<br/>
&gt; burden in battle with song)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Right now at a tolerance of 10 (hard earned, I might add, heh) I notice no<br/>
&gt; real difference after a few drinks, as in reduction of the<br/>
&gt; negative effects.<br/>
&gt; Even then, I don&#39;t believe I am affected much by my loss in<br/>
&gt; intelligence, as<br/>
&gt; a bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I decided to take up brewing, and have not successfully made my own yet,<br/>
&gt; grrr.  Is the book of lymrics required?  I -think- I saw the book near the<br/>
&gt; gnomish city, cannot be certain.  Anyone suggest where I may find<br/>
&gt; it on the<br/>
&gt; mainland (freeport area, but I can travel to Qeynos if need be).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Remember the old Bard&#39;s Tale?  Ah, this was where Roop was born, so long<br/>
&gt; long ago.  Had to keep my whistle wet back then, just to continue barding!<br/>
&gt; A bard here is not required to imbibe, which is fine, though a bit<br/>
&gt; out-of-character in my own opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far I am quite pleased with the effects of alchohol here.  A<br/>
&gt; friend and I<br/>
&gt; returned from adventures to fine Rivervale, and in celebration of our<br/>
&gt; success I purchased 1pp worth of fishwine, weeoooo!  And I never<br/>
&gt; laughed so<br/>
&gt; hard as when I heard my comrade speak, or rather burbble... the drunken<br/>
&gt; language.  That fishwine has a kick!  At least someone might describe the<br/>
&gt; components one uses to create fishwine in the still?  I have developed a<br/>
&gt; taste for the stuff.  Mead, for some odd reason, cannot be drunk?<br/>
&gt;  And, how<br/>
&gt; does one actually use a shotglass?  I am still just guzzling directly from<br/>
&gt; the bottle itself, uncooth, I know. </span></blockquote></div>
