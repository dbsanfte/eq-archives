<div id="ygrps-yiv-385068855">Giving away banded.. doph.. the poor blacksmiths who spent all that time<br/>
learning the craft so they could be undersold by someone giveing it away.<br/>
makes me sad.  We surely do have a diffence of opinion.  10-15 levels with<br/>
the same equipment?  Wow if I were twinked like that, I could see why you<br/>
would think that the game STARTs at level 20 :)  Thats when you started<br/>
getting stuff for yourself :)  Anyway, I really think that if Verant wanted<br/>
to stop twinking then they would have done something about it, so even<br/>
though I think you are very wrong, I cannot change the world.  <br/>
<br/>
Im not going to comment on this anymore:(  I dont think my what i believe is<br/>
the majority and I dont want a flame war, over my strong opinion.  Suffice<br/>
to say, I disagree.<br/>

&gt; But are you really making their life easier by twinking them?  Are you<br/>
&gt; really enhancing the playing experience?  I know a Druid, who was givin<br/>
the<br/>
<br/>
	I think it depends on the class they&#39;re playing, and the equipment<br/>
in question.  Giving a low level person full banded ot leather I don&#39;t see<br/>
as a big issue, sure it&#39;ll be good for them for the next 10 or 15 levels,<br/>
but there still many upgrades to all their pieces of equipment, and many<br/>
of them come as early as the mid teens.  Frankly, I see most of my<br/>
true gaming experience in everquest as between levels 20 and 49, and <br/>
giving a player some equipment to carry them out of the newbie areas and<br/>
into the levels where people start to find regular groups and learn the<br/>
real joys of group dynamics and player interaction is definitely an<br/>
enchancement.  Spending 8 hours chunks solo hunting wisps for money so I <br/>
can scrounge the last few plat I need for banded armor is definitely not<br/>
why I paid to play EQ.<br/>
