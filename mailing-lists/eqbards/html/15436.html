<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090202118">Okay, Okay...<br/>
<br/>
I was an admin on an LP MUD for a long time...<br/>
I know LP and DIKU are not exactly the same...<br/>
As for the XP tables in LP/DIKU...they started out the same way...<br/>
These numbers are generalized...if you want the real ones, let me know and<br/>
i&#39;ll log into my old admin char, and get the actuals from the internals of<br/>
the mud.<br/>
Level 1 = 100 xp<br/>
Level 2 = 250 xp<br/>
Level 3 = 600 xp<br/>
Level 4 = 1300 or 1400 xp<br/>
Level 5 = 3000 xp<br/>
Level 6 = 6000 xp<br/>
etc.<br/>
Level 18 = 225,000 xp<br/>
Level 19 = 490,000 xp<br/>
Level 20 = 1,000,000 xp<br/>
i seem to remember that each level was a bit more than double the one before<br/>
EXCEPT the (n*5)+1 levels, which were exactly double the (n*5) levels<br/>
<br/>
This table was manually adjusted for each lp mud, level 20 = 1,000,000 xp in<br/>
most<br/>
(initally, all lpmuds were based on 20 levels...many lps advanced this to<br/>
50, or 100 or even more)<br/>
(also, I helped develop the xp tables for 20-50 when our mud decided to let<br/>
char&#39;s go beyond the 20 limit)<br/>
we decided that doubling every time after 20 was too much, i.e. 2 mil, 4<br/>
mil, 8 mil, plus there is a limit to the variable in it&#39;s value to hold the<br/>
requisite number of places (about level 32, you run out of bits:)<br/>
we decided on 1.2(prev level xp) for each level over 20, therefore making it<br/>
a linear run from 20 to 50.<br/>
1 mil, 1.2 mil, 1.44 mil, etc.<br/>
the run from 1 to 20 was definately not linear, that i remember, although we<br/>
tweaked ours out, due to specifics in our mud...<br/>
<br/>
oh, god, my brain is twitching trying to remember all that lp code.<br/>

<br/>
p.s. in the old-style text muds, once you hit level 20, you were either<br/>
stuck there, or given the opportunity to become a &#39;wizard&#39;, i.e. coder.  our<br/>
mud changed that to &#39;anytime from 20 to 50 you desire, and can find an<br/>
existing wizard to sponsor you, you can &#39;wiz&#39; (be promoted to coder).<br/>
many others follow(ed) this same suit, from what i understand.<br/>
Incidentally, there is a &#39;mud campus&#39; where all the code is exposed, and you<br/>
can learn what code does which, if you so desire.<br/>

also search yahoo for MUD, look under the games...<br/>
LP and DIKU mud source code should be out there...if you want it, and can&#39;t<br/>
find it, email me and i will get it for you<br/>

&gt; In the words of Conan Doyle, &quot;The Plot Thickens&quot;...  For those of you who<br/>
&gt; are unaware, DIKU Mud - was a popular MUD.  I&#39;m guessing that the code is<br/>
&gt; available in the Public Domain...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t recall Brad specifically saying that Hell Levels was unintentional<br/>
&gt; (I sure will take others word for it) - but I do recall him saying they<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; common in MUDs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It sure is beginning to appear that Verant &quot;borrowed&quot; (Diku?) MUD code and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s in place in EQ.  Whether intentional or not - Verant has made it<br/>
clear<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s hear to stay...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I see what you&#39;re saying now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I still have to disagree though. Verant has stated, and recent<br/>
&gt; investigation<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems to bear out their claims, that hell levels were not intended but<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; side effect of the exp formula. That being the case I find it highly<br/>
&gt; &gt; unlikely that they have any code that says &quot;Hell level + 1&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
