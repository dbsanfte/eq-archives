&gt;I have decided not to quit simply because of my friends in my guild and on<br/>
&gt;my server.  I have little to no respect for Verant in the regards of<br/>
&gt;customer service and understanding the dynamic of the game they created.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While I will continue to pay my $10/month - I will probably never buy<br/>
&gt;another game from them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my two cents!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>heh i also find it amusing people come out and say &#39;&#39;I will NEVER buy another Verant<br/>
game!&#39;&#39; and then in the next sentence they say well i will probly try star wars online, heh.<br/>
and out of all the people who say this kind of stuff, if your friends from EQ buy EQ2 and<br/>
spend a lot of time playing it, you won&#39;t join them?  how would that be any different than<br/>
paying 10 bucks per month now?</div>
