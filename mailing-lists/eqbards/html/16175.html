<b>Subject:</b> RE: Class balance <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437032452">One thing to keep in mind is grouping vs solo.  It is<br/>
my belief that verant doesn&#39;t really care about<br/>
solo&#39;ing and they&#39;re just fine with necros being<br/>
ridiculously overpowered for solo.  In a group a necro<br/>
has some very good utility with their recent spell<br/>
additions but prior to that their dot&#39;s caused many a<br/>
problem, dot bugs, stacking, etc.  I do think necros<br/>
are a good but not overpowered group memeber.  <br/>
<br/>
Slightly side note: I think that the hybrids need<br/>
*significantly* more work than any other classes to<br/>
balance.  As it stands, in a group, the utility you<br/>
get from a hybrid (as opposed to a warrior instead)<br/>
amounts to:<br/>
Ranger:<br/>
snare, harmony, very minor healing and nuking<br/>
Their buffs are overwritten by cleric/druid buffs. <br/>
And if you have a druid in your group you don&#39;t need<br/>
the Ranger to snare/harmony.<br/>
Paladin:<br/>
healing and revive and LoH.  Basically this is playing<br/>
to lose, I&#39;d rather have a warrior with a lot lot more<br/>
hps/ac/skill levels than a paladin where you only need<br/>
his help when things go wrong.<br/>
Shadowknight:<br/>
invis, invis undead, feign death.  Ok well FD is<br/>
pretty darn good the rest are utility that your<br/>
cleric/enchanter/necro is going to provide anyways.<br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m saying is right now I see a Warrior as<br/>
significantly better than a hybrid in a group and the<br/>
hybrid has roughly a 50% xp penalty over a warrior as<br/>
well as less weapons, armor and skill caps.  <br/>
<br/>
So at any rate what all this rambling is about is, IMO<br/>
Verant balancing of the classes quite simply isn&#39;t. <br/>
There is no balance of the classes and that frustrates<br/>
me.<br/>

Despite all the cries of nerf from necros, necros are<br/>
still so overpowered compared to the other classes<br/>
that a single necro can do things that require several<br/>
L50s of other classes.  It hasn&#39;t been fixed yet, so<br/>
my guess is that a couple important people at Verant<br/>
play necros and want to keep things that way. <br/>
Seriously, I think class balance is a low priority<br/>
with them.<br/>
