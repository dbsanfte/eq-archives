<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393490516">For anyone that knows what drops where , I have one question I hope you could <br/>
answer :)<br/>
<br/>
I have been in the zone for days looking for this thing, originally i heard <br/>
it was a roaming non static spawn , so i just ran around killing some things <br/>
, and also hoping that other groups hunting there might cause it to spawn. <br/>
<br/>
But , now it seems its static . <br/>
<br/>
So my questions are ( if you can answer them )<br/>
<br/>
1) is it a roamer or a static? , just looking for a confirmation on this one. <br/>
<br/>
2) this one I hope you&#39;ll answer hehe. Not looking for a name or  specific <br/>
location , but in my search ( solo ) , this would help a lot.    There is a <br/>
kind of zone divider on one side is frogs and mantraps and other such stuff , <br/>
and then there is that gate , and the spectral / treasure hunter side . could <br/>
you possibly say which side its on , in either case there is still a ton on <br/>
either side. but it would really help.  I wanna find this sucker on my own , <br/>
but its getting old hehe. <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to answer this on the list you can email me privately at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kevikazzam@...">kevikazzam@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it gives away too much , and would be a great help to me <br/>
In anycase thanks for your time. <br/>
