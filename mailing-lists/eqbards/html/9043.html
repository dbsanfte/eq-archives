<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942374488">Today in unrest, we were camping at the back wall behind the back door,<br/>
as was  another group of 6. we were both fighting seperate pulls and we<br/>
were about 30 feet apart. Just as my group was about to finish the<br/>
carrion ghould we were fighting, i saw a barbed skel break from the<br/>
OTHER group and run to ME and attack. once we killed the CG, i targeted<br/>
the BB skel and he was a HALF health. the other group came over and<br/>
finished him.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is bard hate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A seperate example of bard hate, and what i belive is our main proble is<br/>
this: group of 6 good players pulls 3 mobs. Since they are good, they<br/>
all use /assist to assist the puller and kill one mob at a time (yeah<br/>
right). The other 2 mobs are undamaged. Then they see this snotty bard<br/>
Buff the group (anthem) and then Heal the group (hymn). That pisses them<br/>
off so they attach to the bard. Hymn does about 15 points of healing,<br/>
and who know how bad the buff adds to that hate, by the time the first<br/>
mob is dead the other 2 REALLY hate the bard.<br/>
<br/>
I think if any other class could cast 3 songs at the same time, and<br/>
renew them every 6 seconds, the mobs would hate them too.<br/>

&gt; I have been hearing rumors that &quot;bard hate&quot; does not really exist... Anyone<br/>
&gt; actually have proof that it does? </span></blockquote></div>
