<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018676434">Note: I sent this to the ranger group and thought it might be helpful for<br/>
some of you also. Check out it out and let me know what ya&#39;ll think!<br/>
<br/>
No need to claim to view the spells when you read the exact spell from the<br/>
spell dat file.<br/>
<br/>
EQCaster (http://www.eqcaster.com) is a program that lists every spell in<br/>
the Everquest world, including procs on weapons. The procs is something that<br/>
would not be listed on castersrelm. Every spell is on your hard drive in<br/>
your EverQuest folder named spdat.eff. The EQCaster program reads this file<br/>
and lists all the information. Like for instance the weapon Wavecrasher. It<br/>
has a effect on the weapon called Breath of the Sea. I do not think any<br/>
class has this spell. Looking at the spell information, the proc does the<br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
Effects:<br/>
Decrease Attack speed by 20%<br/>
Decrease Hit Points (HP) by 20 per tick over 10 ticks<br/>
Target: PC/NPC Targeted <br/>
Duration: 10 ticks (1 minute) <br/>
Casting Time: 0 second <br/>
Recovery Time: 15 seconds <br/>
Recasting Time: 0 second <br/>
Resistance Check: Magic <br/>
Range: 200.0 feet <br/>
Message when someone cast on you: You are slowed by the mist of the seas. <br/>
Message when someone cast on other: Aradune is slowed by the mist of the<br/>
seas. <br/>
Message when spell fades: The mist melts away.<br/>
 <br/>
So, this weapon will proc a 20% slow plus a 200 hit point damage over time.<br/>
The DOT information tells me that it is going to do 20 HP of damage every 6<br/>
seconds, for 60 seconds. This data also tells me that this weapon proc is<br/>
checked against the NPC/PC magic resistance. <br/>
<br/>
Spell reading programs are very helpful and can give you a lot of valuable<br/>
information. <br/>
<br/>
If you do not feel like downloading a program, you can also go to some web<br/>
sites that host this type of program and browse for a spell or proc. One<br/>
good web site is the Night Watchers guild from 7th Hammer<br/>
(http://nightwatchers.dpn.ch/ &lt;http://nightwatchers.dpn.ch/&gt;  ) Go to the<br/>
tool bar of the left and down at the bottom you can search for an item or<br/>
spell. Click on Search under Equipment and in the new page type in the<br/>
weapon, armor, potion, bag, food or drink or whatever is in the entire game<br/>
of EverQuest. If you just put the word boot into the search, it will give<br/>
you the results of EVERYTHING the has the word boot in the item. With 10<br/>
pages of results you can then click on any of the items with the word boots<br/>
in them. After you click on any of these boots, you see all the stats for<br/>
this boot. I clicked on the Akkirus&#39; Boots of the Risen. Every item in EQ<br/>
has an item number. Akkirus&#39; Boots of the Risen is item number 31146.<br/>
Akkirus&#39; Boots of the Risen also has an effect, Abundant Drink. You can<br/>
click on this Effect and the new page will display the effects.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very awesome web page, check it out. It is cool to see all the new<br/>
items coming into the game and wonder what this effect does and then able to<br/>
click the effect and know exactly what it does.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Speaking of &quot;new spells&quot;, I came across a program which claimed to<br/>
list all<br/>
	of the spells in EQ. Well, it lists all of the normal spells, but<br/>
also many<br/>
	I&#39;ve never heard of and can&#39;t find on castersrealm.com or<br/>
everlore.com.<br/>
	They&#39;re also, sometimes, out of proportion with their level...but in<br/>
a way<br/>
	that doesn&#39;t seem like just some silly joke.<br/>
<br/>
	Could they be listing NPC spells by level or something?<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;d give the name of the program, but it&#39;s at home and I&#39;m not.<br/>
