<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207920351">I imagine that the animation guy&#39;s been working on Kunark and each mob in each<br/>
of the planes.  But anyway...<br/>

I don&#39;t want this thread to turn ugly, so I&#39;ll stay out of  it from here on.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that EQ is so buggy that it can be compared to buying the wrong<br/>
stock, or having 5 keys missing on your keyboard.<br/>
Those errors would render the software/keyboard 100 percent unusable.<br/>
<br/>
Every class has 40-50th lvl players.  It works.  It&#39;s fun.  It&#39;s SO addictive<br/>
that we agonize over the most trivial aspects.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t believe that the Verant employees who put out SO MUCH work are a<br/>
bunch of lazy, slack-jawed troglodytes that can&#39;t be bothered to do anything.<br/>
If anything, I think they&#39;re pushed to the wall with trying to keep up.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wants something, and each change takes much time.  Changes I make in<br/>
code or process take alot of time.<br/>
<br/>
How much time do you think it takes just to READ all of the input from players,<br/>
in game and out?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be proud if I produced something as complex and addictive as EQ.  And I&#39;m<br/>
grateful for the work they put in.<br/>

Strumming the &#39;flute&#39; drum is an animation.  At least they could have fixed<br/>
it so we beat on the &#39;flute&#39; drum.  Then they&#39;d be halfway there and only<br/>
need to change the &#39;flute&#39; into a drum when they do a graphics patch.  Also<br/>
unless this &#39;animations&#39; guy does other work, he&#39;s been sitting around doing<br/>
nothing most of the time.  I doubt they have a programmer who just does<br/>
animations for the existing game.  If so, he put a bunch of animations in<br/>
once, fixed the playing while sitting, and that&#39;s about it since release.<br/>
Also the people who could have fixed the other things like our broken song<br/>
din&#39;t not fix it because of time constraints.  They didn&#39;t fix it because as<br/>
far as they were concerned it wasn&#39;t broken.  Once they decided it was<br/>
broken it got fixed pretty quickly.  Same thing with Shamanic Alchemy, etc.<br/>
This isn&#39;t a resource issue.  All that matters is whether they think<br/>
something&#39;s broken, and it takes 6+ months of customers complaints to<br/>
convince them that something they think works is fact broken.  That&#39;s their<br/>
real problem.  If we say something appears to be broken their approach is<br/>
ask some programmer if its broken, when they say no it works fine, repeat<br/>
that to the customer or ignore them depending on current whims.  Actually<br/>
getting them to test to see if it might really be broken takes a ridiculous<br/>
amount of effort.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody should also point out to Abashi that Microsoft doesn&#39;t put out word<br/>
processors that are missing 5 letters of the alphabet when they release<br/>
them, and then claim they are waiting to put those in later.  His comparison<br/>
of user complaints between Microsoft and EQ was ludicrous.  My company puts<br/>
out software and we&#39;d for sure be getting customer complaints, in fact<br/>
lawsuits, if we had half the bugs in our code that Verant does.  I can hear<br/>
the help desk now.  &quot;I know it looks like your buying a Tech fund whenever<br/>
you buy our Asian Growth product, but its just a graphics glitch.  We can&#39;t<br/>
fix that in a patch right now.&quot;<br/>
