&gt;just a question about all this song juggling.  what is the roleplaying<br/>
&gt;aspect of it.  personally i sing one song, because in reality i can<br/>
&gt;only sing one song.  if roleplaying doesn&#39;t matter to you fine, but<br/>
&gt;this is just an observation for all you rpers like me.<br/>
&gt;in case anybody knows me i am going to have to end my character Olczyk<br/>
&gt;on tarew marr soon.  long story don&#39;t ask.  just wish everyone good bye<br/>
&gt;from his perspective, and i will be back as some new incarnation soon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, as a real-life bard (don&#39;t ask, just trust me), I can assure you that<br/>
you CAN indeed sing two songs simultaneously.  It&#39;s a neat trick, and when<br/>
done properly, creates a third, all new song that has it&#39;s own sound.<br/>
<br/>
From an RP perspective, it&#39;s simply an advanced singing method.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s an RP server being requested.  I&#39;d be very<br/>
interested in seeing how that turns out.<br/>
