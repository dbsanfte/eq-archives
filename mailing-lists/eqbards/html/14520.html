<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031863889">Wow.  Never been in that dungeon, being a mere 20th level, but that is some<br/>
interesting wall art.<br/>
<br/>
#13 - Harmonic, that is not a guy with yellow glowing eyes.  That is the<br/>
King with a crown on his head.  Whoever the grey guys are, they are<br/>
celebrating their victory over the slain oppositions King and some of his<br/>
followers.<br/>
<br/>
#14 - Is the one I like the most is the Priest/King/Shaman of the grey<br/>
people who has the multi-colored plumes on his head. And of course the<br/>
colorful bathing suits of the worshipping grey followers below him.<br/>
<br/>
#15 - This one is very interesting.  Lots of grey people (2 at the bottom<br/>
upright with colorful bathing suits) surrounding a lava spout (?) perhaps?<br/>
Could this be a representation of the cataclysm which allowed the grey<br/>
people to invade the brown peoples underground dwelling and eventually,<br/>
enslave or conquer them?<br/>
<br/>
Most of the pictures show, to me the grey people&#39;s invasion and conquering<br/>
of the brown people.  It seems that the dragon was brought with the grey<br/>
people to help accomplish this.  This may be besides the point but it seems<br/>
as if in some of the pictures the grey people appear to be swimming.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the grey/brown people thing.  I have never been to this dungeon<br/>
and don&#39;t know what mobs live there.<br/>

<br/>
   I suppose first of all you have to identify the elements in the<br/>
   paintings.  There are white creatures (small), there are white<br/>
   creatures (bigger, but are they the same thing?), there are brown<br/>
   things (small, usually laying down) and brown creatures that are<br/>
   bigger possibly the same thing but standing up.  Then there is this<br/>
   doglike creature, much bigger than the rest.<br/>
<br/>
   Some figures are laying down (as if dead), some have weapons,<br/>
   some are dancing, some are running, some are chasing others<br/>
   while others are being chased.<br/>
<br/>
   Back to #13, lots of dead? brown creatures, one of them has<br/>
   yellow glowing eyes, while the small white creatures appear<br/>
   to be dancing? around it?  Truly weird.<br/>
