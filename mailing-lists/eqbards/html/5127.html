  You have to train at least one point in your wind skill in order to play the wind songs.<br/>

  Try that and see<br/>

    I have a question on this song.  I am a level 17 bard, and just recently acquired this song.  I equipped my flute, and tried to play it.  I got the following message:  Learn to sing it before you play it.  I proceeded to try and sing it, and could never get it going.  Nothing but one missed note after the other.  Is this common?  Am I doing something wrong?  Also, do I need a mouthpiece for my flute?  I bought the flute from the Bard&#39;s Guild, and eqipped it as usual before I tried the song.  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>
