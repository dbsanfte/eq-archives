<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011526824">Heh .. I had a group who didn&#39;t flip out when I mezz .. seemed quite happy<br/>
... then surpised that I died alot doing it when each one of the tanks would<br/>
hit a different mezzed mob .. and the Cleric used to join in and thump any<br/>
they hadn&#39;t already hit (after I mezzed) ... heh  I even made a hotkey for<br/>
MEZZing all on ONE mob.  The argument one used was that if they didn&#39;t hit<br/>
my mezzed mobs they&#39;d hit the healer.   Weell they hit the mob .. it hit me<br/>
.. she healed me .. it jumped her ... I went DOH!  I ended up *having* to<br/>
use charm to pull two mobs physically away (and hoped all we had was 3) if I<br/>
wanted to live.   At least they could smack on my charmed mob - and did  ;)<br/>
in an overpull and I had a prayer at living thru it.<br/>
<br/>
So I stopped playing with them late 20&#39;s .. they just got to 30 and grouped<br/>
with a Bard with Clarity .. asked me to come back and promised me ..<br/>
<br/>
- I&#39;d only have to play mana song in breaks<br/>
- I could do no singing in combat (they seem to notice the mezz/die pattern<br/>
after 5 levels, and that mobs like me when I sing)<br/>
- All I had to do in combat was tank!!!<br/>
<br/>
Heh .. I&#39;m a wood-elfen lass and NOT set up as a battle Bard .. more CHA/DEX<br/>
than STR...<br/>
<br/>
I rolled on the floor laughing ...<br/>
<br/>
To the credit of other players who didn&#39;t know much about Bards but had seen<br/>
me in action .. they rolled on the floor laughing when I told them ...<br/>
unfortunately my new group all started new chars and I&#39;m helping the Bard<br/>
there learn about the hall, song analysis pages and passing on info from<br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
 My new group has a very competent enchanter .. and well .. she&#39;s realizing<br/>
how much she overlaps the bard .. not just crowd control either ... so I do<br/>
understand the game-play thread.  The Bard (esp. with current state of our<br/>
crowd control song) isn&#39;t nearly as good as an Enchanter .. BUT .. the Bard<br/>
is never OOM :)  Our group accepts some functions at a lower rate (less<br/>
quickness recently) and provided by the Bard in order to conserve caster<br/>
mana.   And I know when the casters were OOM ... everyone suddendly would<br/>
turn and look at my Bard .. HOPING she had the right song memmed for<br/>
wahtever had just gone wrong :) .. and sometimes I was frantically memming<br/>
one while hoping a tank held!!<br/>
<br/>
If the group can&#39;t work with you, you&#39;ll be like the &#39;chanter DEAD .. get a<br/>
new group .. or retire Bard.<br/>
<br/>
Menuette (Allegretto) Bard semi-retired unless a sane group has formed,<br/>
