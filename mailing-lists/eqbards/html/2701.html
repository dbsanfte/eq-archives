Considering druids, rangers, shamen, clerics, monks, and bards<br/>
seem to be the classes who complain the least, I thought it<br/>
was interesting that we ended up so low on this poll.  I also<br/>
suspect a lot of people are voting based on what they&#39;ve seen<br/>
(no way would I rank magician below wizard - a L20 mage<br/>
letting his pet tank while he meditated was easily mowing<br/>
through orcs I was barely able to fight one on one at L24),<br/>
rather than what they&#39;ve played.  Would be interesting to see<br/>
how these percentages compare to the numbers of each class on<br/>
the servers.<br/>
