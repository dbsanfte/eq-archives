&gt; Just one . . . me, almost 31.  Besides that there is a level 28, 12 and a<br/>
7.<br/>
&gt; I did a /who all bard 30 40, /who all bard 41 50, /who all bard 51 60, the<br/>
&gt; other day when there were 2400 people on the server and only came up with<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; total of about 30 people across all 3 searches. =&#92;  More armor for me I<br/>
guess!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Just a quick question. How many bards above 30 are there in your guilds?<br/>

&gt; &gt;The more i play, the less bards i realize there are. When i do a /who all<br/>
&gt; &gt;bard in my guild, i count 2 bards at the most, me and a lev 52 (unless<br/>
&gt; &gt;there&#39;s a hidden one somewhere).  How sad is that? do a /who all warrior<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt;any other class in the guild and you&#39;ll see on average 7.  Mind you in a<br/>

&gt; Subject: Drum model and stuff<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The drum thing bugs me. We said in beta, why do we strum a stick? they<br/>
&gt; said, it&#39;s beta we&#39;ll fix it. Release, we still strum a stick, they say we<br/>
&gt; forgot to do the drum. Drum gets likened to the barb shield thing, it&#39;s<br/>
too<br/>
&gt; big, maybe we can fix it later. Something like a year later, new lands<br/>
(and<br/>
&gt; all that modeling) still a stick. Nostrolo&#39;s tamborine gets turned into a<br/>
&gt; tamborine instead of a stick, all drums are still sticks. Give me odds the<br/>
&gt; next addition and the chance to recitfy the drum thing and avoid the large<br/>
&gt; d/l (cited as a main drawback to fixing) still won&#39;t have a drum. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; played a bard for 2 years as of next month, and that seems like a damn<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; time for something to be outstanding. It says they either don&#39;t care or<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are simply unable to deal with the volume of problems they have. Granted I<br/>
&gt; am a perfectionist, and spent 15 years in Nuclear Maintenance to make it<br/>
&gt; worse. We tracked outstanding issues based on severity AND the length of<br/>
&gt; time the issue was outstanding. The NRC is very interested in cycle times.<br/>
&gt; The point was long cycle times says the management of the facility was<br/>
&gt; lacking in commitment and efficiency, and would get a plant on the Watch<br/>
&gt; list as fast as a real incident. Gaming is not nuclear power of course,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; the same indicators apply to any industry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On another topic, I have been in Sebilis the last 2 weekends. My cleric<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I either join a group or form one. When no enchanter is available, I have<br/>
&gt; been doing the crowd control. My best is to charm one, have it fight the<br/>
&gt; second or use the 53 mez. The best I can do is 2 mobs mez&#39;ed. I just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to have time to get a 3rd effectively. I was actually down to one<br/>
&gt; bubble of mana left at one point, and we were just at bridge 3. The pickup<br/>
&gt; wizard was annoyed that I wasn&#39;t singing clarity the whole time. :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I often wonder if we should even be asking for Verant to fix the drums.<br/>
&gt; After all, look at the duck waddle we have after the &quot;fix&quot;.  The drum<br/>
&gt; animation that Verant comes out with could be just as bad if not worse.<br/>
Do<br/>
&gt; we really want to take that chance?!  Not me!<br/>

&gt; Our mez song ig useful till at least lvl 30.  I say this because in my<br/>
&gt; cleric&#39;s group (which is now lvl 30) our bard still uses lullaby<br/>
effectivly.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure when it becomes useless (Elfson just about never used it<br/>
&gt; because high taunt factor in pickup groups was too risky for him), but it<br/>
&gt; has some use at least.  Pixie Strike on the other hand is pretty weak for<br/>
&gt; mezzing.  Though I still love the song for its stun effect.  My guild (who<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; now spend most of my time grouped with) was shocked when a healer mob bot<br/>
&gt; off a heal in combat.  &quot;Elf, what did you fall asleep there?&quot;  (I actually<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t knwo the mob was a healer thus wasn&#39;t stunning).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But that shows how useful that song is, my guild just assumes that every<br/>
&gt; heal is going to get interupted.  (Obviously not just me doing it).  SO<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; song is still useful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Face the facts, we knew a month ago we would never get to mez at higher<br/>
&gt; levels.  Live with it.   I don&#39;t know why you masochistly read Gordon&#39;s<br/>
&gt; posts anymore.  You know what he&#39;s going to say.<br/>

&gt; The interrupt component of Pixie Strike still works for me at 41.  I<br/>
havent<br/>
&gt; had the guts to fire up lullaby recently and check it out.  Might have to<br/>
&gt; try that tonight.......<br/>

&gt; Heh not friendly for groups?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Screech:  Any bard who goes into a dungeon where you may have to evac<br/>
should<br/>
&gt; have this memmed.  Also ever fear/snare in burning woods?  Its more<br/>
&gt; effective than a balanced group of 6 fighting the mobs straight up there.<br/>
&gt; We even have sold our cleric on the idea, and he just blasts the mobs now<br/>
&gt; (and heals when things go awry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chains:  I always have this memmed in dungeons too.  Why?  Because stuff<br/>
&gt; happens.  Your ranger goes LD before snaring.  Someone screws up and roots<br/>
&gt; the mob (breaking snare).  There is no snarer in the group (or your snarer<br/>
&gt; is too low).  In any case NOBODY else can chase down a mob while casting<br/>
&gt; snare in an emrgency.  (Is there a junark armor with snare?  If so make<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; nobody a bit smaller)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Songof the Sirens:  You have to be kidding me.  This is our most powerful<br/>
&gt; song (till higher lvl then its the 39 charm song).  Worse case of this<br/>
song<br/>
&gt; is you have one mob damaging the mob the parry is on rather than you 90%<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the time.  Best case, you have 2 mobs beating on each other, while the<br/>
party<br/>
&gt; kills a third.  Oh yea, tell the enchanter who has half a bub of life when<br/>
&gt; you charm the mob off him (giving the healer time to heal) that you<br/>
&gt; shouldn;t mem the song when he&#39;s around.  I cannot count the number of<br/>
&gt; enchanters/healers/over blasters I have saved with this song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Clouding:  Ok here there are some problems, BUT an organzied group can use<br/>
&gt; this song amazingly well.  Player 1 walks, leading the group to their camp<br/>
&gt; in the dungeon.  Rest of group, inlcuding bard singing clouding follows.<br/>
&gt; Player 2 who also knows the way &quot;sweeps&quot; behind the group making sure all<br/>
&gt; stay close.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a quick question. How many bards above 30 are there in your guilds?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The more i play, the less bards i realize there are. When i do a /who all<br/>
&gt; bard in my guild, i count 2 bards at the most, me and a lev 52 (unless<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a hidden one somewhere).  How sad is that? do a /who all warrior<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; any other class in the guild and you&#39;ll see on average 7.  Mind you in a<br/>
&gt; weird way this is to my advantage as whenever i&#39;m planes capable, i wont<br/>
&gt; have to lotto for imbrued since she&#39;s got a full set, a breath of harmony<br/>
&gt; and a partisan.  But still, i still wish there were more bards around but<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; think the numbers will keep dropping as i read this mailing list 8(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. got my ss helm, in a weird way, im kinda happy the effect doesnt work<br/>
&gt; for me yet. I cant wait to see myself in imbrued/ss together, i think the<br/>
&gt; green and yellow look cool together.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: The last 4 digests<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; :P Ok, so I didn&#39;t check my e-mail for 2 days and you<br/>
&gt; all get chatty.  I see how it is...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Alrighty, as to why working as intended isn&#39;t good<br/>
&gt; enough: Simple answer is gameplay.  I&#39;ve heard horror<br/>
&gt; stories of people trying to use the 51 (52?) travel<br/>
&gt; song only to have one member get hit and fall to their<br/>
&gt; death.  I&#39;ve also heard this song won&#39;t stack with<br/>
&gt; dead man floating which would fix the problems with<br/>
&gt; this song right there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What a lot of these songs should do (45th song, the<br/>
&gt; travel song, etc) is create more than one spell icon.<br/>
&gt; The upper level haste song that has the DS on it<br/>
&gt; should have the damage shield component seperate.<br/>
&gt; &gt;From what I&#39;ve heard, the DS is lost so quickly thus<br/>
&gt; canceling the whole song effect that upper level bards<br/>
&gt; simply switch to an earlier haste song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why these &quot;working as intended&quot; songs were a<br/>
&gt; good idea but bad reality.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Abashi&#39;s comments about our singing steel pissed me<br/>
&gt; off even more.  Exactly what are we balanced against<br/>
&gt; right now?  The warrior Cobalt is something I&#39;d love<br/>
&gt; to have. Don&#39;t most of the pieces have healing<br/>
&gt; properties in the form of self buffs to them?  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; really love to know what moron thought the helm,<br/>
&gt; pants, and boots effects were balanced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason why lots of the older bards are still<br/>
&gt; chaffing at the whole lullaby issue is indeed how it<br/>
&gt; used to work.  But it&#39;s also how Verant decided to<br/>
&gt; handle that whole issue.  We have the head magic guy<br/>
&gt; at the time publicly stating it seems messed up.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re told to wait patiently which we do, for 6 to 8<br/>
&gt; months. In that time the break another song but fix<br/>
&gt; it.  Then they break that song again and refuse to fix<br/>
&gt; it.  Then they have a mouthpiece come out and say<br/>
&gt; she&#39;ll get to the bottom of this who promptly tells us<br/>
&gt; some lame excuse about how it&#39;s never supposed to have<br/>
&gt; been useable after 30th.  So where&#39;s the upgrade of<br/>
&gt; lullaby around 29th???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re a bard that was around when you could use<br/>
&gt; lullaby as it used to be, you&#39;re more than likely<br/>
&gt; pretty pissed off right now.  The reason is because 2<br/>
&gt; classes (shaman and cleric) has essentially had their<br/>
&gt; own lullaby issue come up and it either got fixed or<br/>
&gt; is getting fixed.  Mark of Karn was nerfed, they<br/>
&gt; suggested fixes, and Verant went with the one the<br/>
&gt; clerics wanted. BTW, the fix wasn&#39;t one of the options<br/>
&gt; Verant gave them.  All that got done in about a week.<br/>
&gt; It seems now the shamen have gotten Verant to look<br/>
&gt; into their uber weapon.  How much you wanna bet they<br/>
&gt; get a fix close to what the shamen as a whole will be<br/>
&gt; happy with?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since I&#39;m one of those bards who got to play with<br/>
&gt; lullaby, you&#39;re asking if I&#39;m so livid, why do I play<br/>
&gt; a bard?  Mainly cause none of my secondaries are close<br/>
&gt; to 45.  However, I&#39;ve heard is said you can get a<br/>
&gt; warrior to close to that in 2 months or so.  Mine&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 13th in 3 of my regular play days.  Oh, and with<br/>
&gt; bandages, I&#39;m soloing.  I figure a shaman is probably<br/>
&gt; closer to being a bard but I just don&#39;t like how<br/>
&gt; female barbarians look.  Hehe, and I am a true bard<br/>
&gt; when it comes to astetics :P (I saw an absolutely<br/>
&gt; perfect combo.  Runed mithril tunic with BI leggins,<br/>
&gt; arms, boots, gloves and a leather helm.  The half-elf<br/>
&gt; wearing it looked great. Mithril BP, arms, and<br/>
&gt; leggings with singing steel bracers, gauntlets, helm<br/>
&gt; and boots looks awesome too.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, to sum up, Abashi is full of it, I&#39;m bitter,<br/>
&gt; and I think it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to make choices<br/>
&gt; in armor that cut down your AC but 100 to 150 points<br/>
&gt; or so in the name a fashion :)  Another valueable post<br/>
&gt; from me, lol!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OH!  I do remember dragonrealms too.  I was a warrior<br/>
&gt; mage there.  It was 9.95 a month but you could upgrade<br/>
&gt; to 29.95 a month to get access to better hunting<br/>
&gt; areas, and your own house.  Was a good game but the<br/>
&gt; people who ran it angered me to no end and I left when<br/>
&gt; an alternative came out (taps foot waiting for Anarchy<br/>
&gt; Online&#39;s release date).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OH!  Something else I remembered while proof reading.<br/>
&gt; There was a post on whineplay from a bard complaining<br/>
&gt; about a stealth nerf on selo&#39;s.  Reports were<br/>
&gt; conflicting about it so I blew off that issue.<br/>
&gt; Yesterday I noticed selo&#39;s acceleration got noticeably<br/>
&gt; faster.  Kinda like someone broke something and just<br/>
&gt; fixed it maybe? /rude Verant<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow!  This is an oldie!  I can&#39;t remember when I originally posted it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had a look at your guild&#39;s site and read up on your loot systems (you<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; in the negative loot points, iirc ;)  That sounds like a very good system,<br/>
&gt; and I was wondering if other guilds on other servers did similarly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m certainly not in any position to worry about that yet, having just<br/>
&gt; gotten level 32 (yay me!) and my guild certainly isn&#39;t in the realms of<br/>
&gt; uberness like others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; well with us it merely depends on how many points you have in our loot<br/>
&gt; system.  last night a bard got a white scale off gorenaire and a warrior<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; a red scale off talendor.  i&#39;m in no rush to get one, the pieces will come<br/>
&gt; as they come.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well I was bored last night, playing my warrior twink (I will only play<br/>
&gt; Elfson with guildies and for big raids now that he is 47), and I get a<br/>
tell<br/>
&gt; that a group has cleared the fire giants but has decided they are a bit<br/>
weak<br/>
&gt; to drop Naggy, so &quot;How fast can you get your blue butt up to SolB?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Woohoo!  My first dragon run!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They were pretty experienced at this, so things went very smoothly (one<br/>
&gt; melee group bit it when their bard went down), and he dropped very quickly<br/>
&gt; (or so it seemed to me).  I was in the xp group, which is a nice bonus...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He even dropped his drum, which was given (deservedly so) to ther other<br/>
bard<br/>
&gt; there who had been on several Naggy raids in the past.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My original EQ goal has been accomplished!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Strength analysis (was: Abashi finally responds... sort of)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ATK is made of two numbers, yes. The eq.castersrealm.com shaman forums<br/>
&gt; (as well as Shaman&#39;s Curcible and I think another) occasionally have<br/>
&gt; long discussons on the values of stats. Tumadorf is big on numbers and<br/>
&gt; tight analysis, well written and all around in the know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This thread contains a graph of 6 different strengths, from 55 - 228<br/>
&gt; showing not much more than random variance and a spike at the magic<br/>
&gt; number and 1 damage frequency as one would expect.<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum12/HTML/000452.html">http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum12/HTML/000452.html</a><br/>
&gt; A somewhat ugly graphical representation surrounded by a nice text<br/>
&gt; analysis. It doesn&#39;t sit too well with me but I can&#39;t nail down why.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I see people commenting on is, why higher strength gives a<br/>
&gt; lower average damage and more hits for 1. Ugh, lower average damage<br/>
&gt; because of the hits for 1 and more hits for 1 because the +str bumps<br/>
&gt; them up from a 0 damage hit (miss). It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t always tell<br/>
&gt; the difference between an avoided miss and a mitigated 0 damage hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just as a point of curiousity:<br/>
&gt; How often do you, as a bard, get ridden for +str songs? I haven&#39;t gone<br/>
&gt; out of my way to use one lately except when I&#39;m smithing. After looking<br/>
&gt; at how little +str effects overall damage (unless in a really melee<br/>
&gt; heavy party) I stick with a haste effect (if no enchanter or I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; busy doing everything else) or damage shields or dots depending on<br/>
&gt; situation. However, I&#39;ve only just hit 42 and haven&#39;t had a chance to<br/>
&gt; try out McVaxius&#39; yet so everything might change after I give it a<br/>
&gt; whirl.<br/>

&gt; &gt; i actually have a few questions about this stuff.<br/>
&gt; &gt; +1 str == +1 atk right?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; now, is atk like ac in that it is made of up 2 numbers, like chance<br/>
&gt; &gt; to hit, and damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; done, sorta like damage avoidance and damage absorption?  if so, then<br/>
&gt; &gt; real damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; applied would also have to increase.<br/>

&gt; &gt; anyone got a good link to the analysis done on this?<br/>
