already get the tracking skill??<br/>

     Gentle Bards,<br/>
     <br/>
     I agree with your idea in theory but not on your choice of song to <br/>
     replace.  Just last night I pulled out several items in my bank that <br/>
     had been sitting around and tried the level 14 song on them.  To my <br/>
     surprise three of them gave me extra info.  It seems that any item <br/>
     that says illegible or blurred will now give you extra info with the <br/>
     song.  Nice touch.  Don&#39;t know when they implemented this but I <br/>
     finished 2 quests last night with the help of this song and will <br/>
     finish the third when I get to Qeynos.  This song is still not a real <br/>
     heavyweight but it actually works now and more importantly Verant is <br/>
     actively using it so they will not be receptive to removing it.  <br/>
     Perhaps the level 22 song.<br/>
     <br/>
     your suggestions<br/>
     <br/>
     1 and 2  Great ideas!<br/>
     <br/>
     3.  They&#39;ll never do it but would be nice.<br/>
     <br/>
     4.  I seem to have a perpetual taunt stamped on my forehead. &lt;gr&gt; I <br/>
     certainly don&#39;t need a taunt song.  <br/>
     <br/>
     5.  see 3 above<br/>
     <br/>
     Another great idea they&#39;ll never do.  A song that acts like the ranger <br/>
     track skill.<br/>
<br/>

I sent this out about an hour ago but I haven&#39;t received it back from the <br/>
list yet so sending it again just in case.  Sorry if we end up getting it <br/>
posted twice.<br/>
     <br/>
Fellow bards,<br/>
     <br/>
I came into work today and there were relatively few messages on the list. <br/>
In an effort to jumpstart some discussion, I have the following proposal.<br/>
     <br/>
If enough people on this list thinks its a good idea, lets submit a petition<br/>
<br/>
to have the level 14 song replaced.  As most of you are aware, the song <br/>
currently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already <br/>
identified.  All you have to do is right click on it.  The only situations I<br/>
<br/>
have heard of the song providing any additional information is when it is <br/>
sung while holding a head.  The name of the person who the head used to be <br/>
attached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you are turning in <br/>
the head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses for this song.<br/>
     <br/>
I propose that we also provide Verant with some ideas on a song to replace <br/>
it with.  The biggest thing to remember here is that the power of the new <br/>
song should be appropriate for a 14th level character.  I don&#39;t think minor <br/>
versions of any higher level song are likely to get approved.  The new song <br/>
should provide a completely new spell efffect.  I request that everyone <br/>
submit to this list their idea of what the new 14th level song should be. <br/>
Once we get several good responses, we can all vote on which ones we think <br/>
have the best chance of getting approved.  We can then submit the petition <br/>
to Verant with the entire list of suggested new songs ranked in the order we<br/>
<br/>
vote on.<br/>
     <br/>
Here are a couple of ideas that I have:<br/>
     <br/>
1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The <br/>
power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or toned <br/>
down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>
     <br/>
2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  The <br/>
amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you sing <br/>
Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an <br/>
instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>
     <br/>
3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.  This <br/>
song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order for <br/>
Verant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in outdoor zones (no<br/>
<br/>
dungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a high skill <br/>
level in the instrument that is required to play it.  If you miss a note and<br/>
<br/>
fail, the song button grays out for a specified amount of time before you <br/>
can try it again.<br/>
     <br/>
4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal <br/>
bard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters are getting <br/>
mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if <br/>
someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>
     <br/>
5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think this <br/>
one would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can include it if <br/>
thats what everyone wants.<br/>
     <br/>
These are what I came up with on the fly.  Make any modifications to these <br/>
that you like.  Submit new ideas if you have one.<br/>
     <br/>
I&#39;m in the Army and will be going out on a field exercise this Thursday for <br/>
the next week.  Assuming this message generates a lot of positive response, <br/>
someone else will have to facilitate discussion on this issue until then.  I<br/>
<br/>
will write up the petition when I get back next week if we all come to an <br/>
agreement.<br/>
