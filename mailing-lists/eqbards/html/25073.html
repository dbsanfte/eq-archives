<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756085747">Lol Minkin :) I bet she was like &quot;uh .. but...uh...&quot; when you said that<br/>
hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I am not very confident because Tani has always been my alt, so I dont have<br/>
much experience with her, so its hard not to just kinda take the role people<br/>
assume you should.  I did find out though that barding is a lot easier if<br/>
you TELL peopel what to do rather than just sitting back and doing your job<br/>
(ala shaman).  Its kinda funny,e ven at this late stage in game maturity,<br/>
people have NO idea what bards are capable of lol.<br/>
<br/>
Thats a good thread btw :)  Lots of info!<br/>

&gt; funny you should mention that.  I was asking the same <br/>
&gt; question today on<br/>
&gt; concerthall.  for some oddball reason our mez overwrites <br/>
&gt; chanter mez. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; had a few bored chanters/confused when I start CC. Was <br/>
&gt; grouped with an old<br/>
&gt; guildie from sol ro yesterday when I had to mez 4 at a time <br/>
&gt; while they beat<br/>
&gt; the 5th down and she was quite &quot;wow bards can do that?&quot; and <br/>
&gt; rest of group<br/>
&gt; was somewhat like that too.  I told her, I&#39;m not a manasong bard...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, here&#39;s the thread<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Played Tani for most of the weekend, had a blast.  I&#39;ve spent <br/>
&gt; most of my<br/>
&gt; higher levels soloing or duoing, and this weekend, I ventured <br/>
&gt; into Sebilis.<br/>
&gt; Wow, what an education.  When we had a chanter, life was all fun... he<br/>
&gt; slowed, messed and hasted.  I really didnt have to do any <br/>
&gt; work but when I<br/>
&gt; was the crowd control.. well, wow.. its really hard to mes <br/>
&gt; things and then<br/>
&gt; still fight the target mob.  I started to get the hang of it <br/>
&gt; though and<br/>
&gt; found outside views really help a lot.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My question is, what is up with the 53 mez and chanter mez?  <br/>
&gt; I found out the<br/>
&gt; hard way (i.e. group death spree) that they don&#39;t seem to <br/>
&gt; stack!?!  But my<br/>
&gt; 53 mez seemed to overwrite the 59 chanter mez???!!! Whats up <br/>
&gt; with that?  Am<br/>
&gt; I wrong here?  What am I missing?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Tani, 53rd Bardette<br/>
&gt; Halana, 60th Shammykins<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; P.S. Been a while, missed you all!  Has anyone quit eq that i <br/>
&gt; shold know<br/>
&gt; about? Seems like lots are lately =/<br/>
