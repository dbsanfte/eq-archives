I finally made 25th level and its time to review my equipment and weapons so<br/>
here we go:<br/>

Face:        Grotesque Mask<br/>
Head:        Lambent Helm<br/>
Finger:      Jeweler Made +5 AGI<br/>
Finger:      Jeweler Made +2 STR<br/>
Wrist:       Silver Plated Bracer<br/>
Wrist:       Silver Plated Bracer<br/>
Arm:         Azure Sleeves<br/>
Hands:    Dark Elf Skin Gloves<br/>

BP:         Lambent<br/>
Back:      Cloak of Ice Bear<br/>
Belt:        Purity Belt<br/>

<br/>
Weapons:<br/>
Cryst Blade, BBK, Silvery War Axe, Crookstinger, Obs. Shard, BE Mace, FS<br/>
Scim, Staff O&#39; Writhing, Dragoon Dirk in ranged slot.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I&#39;m NOT a twink, I spent 2 weeks on wisp isle and 3 weeks on Garg Isle<br/>
good plat in these places. I want to get full Lambent, but need ideas for<br/>
non-visible areas and jewelry, I especially need to replace my face piece.<br/>
Also I need to reduce the number of weapons I have and use them for trade or<br/>
plat. Any ideas will be welcome.<br/>
