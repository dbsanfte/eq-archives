<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293716598">I keep a set of patchwork and a rusty bastard sword (&quot;Old Rusty&quot; from<br/>
my newbie days) in the bank for just such an occasion.  Its not much,<br/>
but it&#39;s a little better than starting from nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I also keep a fire beetle eye and a spare drum in the bank for corpse<br/>
retrievals.<br/>

 &gt; &gt; After an unfortunate night in Steamfont with a wrong turn to Meldrath I lost<br/>

 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; Sorry, but running around &#39;naked&#39; as you are, you really can&#39;t do<br/>
 &gt; both.  For money, I&#39;d start with fishing.  Easy, low risk, and SLOW!<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; Then the next step is to find a weapon, any weapon, and some armour,<br/>
 &gt; any armour.  I&#39;d recommend finding a nice decaying skeleton with a<br/>
 &gt; weapon, and a friendly tailor.  I know that I sew for free given<br/>
 &gt; the raw materials.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; Once you are armoured and weaponed, you can start to hunt the things<br/>
 &gt; you used to, but carefully.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; You didn&#39;t mention what level you are, so the above advice is pretty<br/>
 &gt; generic.  I used this tactic when my corpse was lost, at about level<br/>
 &gt; 9.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; Of course, friends who are relatively well off may offer to loan you<br/>
 &gt; reasonable sums of money, which will help you get back to where you<br/>
 &gt; were before much quicker.<br/>
