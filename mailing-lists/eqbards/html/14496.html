<div id="ygrps-yiv-272643927">Actually, wouldnt Nagafen be painted in red, as well as any Fire Goblins,<br/>
etc?<br/>
Perhaps It is Vox, and the ICe goblins. would explain the white color<br/>

  can tell, I don&#39;t think the kobolds know anything about frogloks.<br/>
<br/>
  I think goblins, firegiants, kobolds, and nagafen are portrayed.<br/>
  But who is who is hard to tell, besides the big dog Nagafen.  If<br/>
  in fact it is Nagafen, it may not be.<br/>
