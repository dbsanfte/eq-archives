<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600839665">Wow.  I had a great weekend in EverQuest and have to share with you guys.  I<br/>
honestly don&#39;t mean this as a boast, but real life&#39;s random number generator<br/>
can be as clumpy as Verant&#39;s and here&#39;s proof.<br/>
<br/>
Friday night:<br/>
My guild is doing Hate so of course I&#39;m there.  Within the first hour of our<br/>
break-in both Imbrued Arms and Gauntlets dropped.  The only other bard<br/>
present is maxxed in Planer equipment and weapons so of course I got them.<br/>
Crier is happy happy.  Several hours later we take Innoruuk down (having<br/>
bypassed the Maestro) and he drops a Dawnchaser (piercing 11/25, BRD only) -<br/>
the only other bard present already has one the only one on the server<br/>
(Druzzil Ro), so I got it.  Crier is ecstatic and goes to bed at 6am.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday Night:<br/>
Crier logs in at 5pm and ask the guild what&#39;s up.  &quot;Plane of Sky&quot;  Ok<br/>
great..  So not 20 minutes after logging in I&#39;m sitting on the wiz pad in<br/>
Nek waiting for a port up listening to my guild killing Azaraks on isle two<br/>
and it&#39;s getting messy.  Three Az down and almost everyone dead.  &quot;BARD<br/>
BELT!  Get Crier up here!&quot; is being called from PoS.  A wizard ports to me,<br/>
ports me in to Sky, I buy a key and suicide run to the belt and get it.<br/>
Belt of Concordance (AC 6, STR 5, CHA 5, SV Poison +5, Effect: Haste) is<br/>
basically a Flowing Black Silk Sash with really nice bard stats.  I gladly<br/>
pass down my fbss to a guildy rogue who needs one (this is how my guild<br/>
works).<br/>
<br/>
Later Saturday Night:<br/>
My guild decides to back off of Sky and assess what we&#39;ve learned before<br/>
spending another 20kpp, so we leave sky around 10:30pm my time. and disperse<br/>
for experience camps.  Another guild is in Plane of Fear and has been<br/>
clearing all night.  Around 1:30am that guild gives up Fear for sleep and<br/>
says that if our guild wants Cazic Thule that&#39;s ok with them.  Since my<br/>
guild doesn&#39;t sleep, we leave our experience camps and set up in Fear, kill<br/>
a couple dozen mobs and then drop Cazic with little difficulty around 5:30am<br/>
Sunday morning.  Among other stuff Cazic drops a Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo<br/>
and I&#39;m the only bard present.  At this point I try hard to defer the<br/>
piccolo to another guildy bard because I&#39;m getting embarrassed at having<br/>
gotten so much stuff.  The other bard refuses to accept it.<br/>
<br/>
- Imbrued Arms and Gauntlets<br/>
- Dawnchaser<br/>
- Belt of Concordance<br/>
- Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo<br/>
<br/>
All in two evenings.  Hot damn.  Further evidence that good things come if<br/>
you persist long enough.  Stick with your bards folks, we&#39;re a great class.<br/>
<br/>
Weekends like this are why I&#39;m still 48 though.  There&#39;s literally around 25<br/>
deaths in that weekend.  :-)<br/>
