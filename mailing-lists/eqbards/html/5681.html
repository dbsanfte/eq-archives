&gt;Well, I can say for certain that as of last night, no change had been made<br/>
&gt;to our Chords of Dissonance.  I used it to kite a few groups of beetles<br/>
&gt;(from 4 to 6 at a time) in North Karana, and it worked just like always:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;by the group, pulse Chords, run away and heal while their health drops<br/>
&gt;steadily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Therefore, either Verant has not yet implemented the DoT &quot;advancing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>monster&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;nonsense on the production servers, or they are not including bards (or at<br/>
&gt;least Chords of Dissonance) in this restriction (oh please oh please).  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;put my money on the former.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know about you folks, but I have always thought that running into a<br/>
&gt;group of nasties, pulsing Chords, and then running away playing a medley of<br/>
&gt;Hymn and Selo&#39;s was a very useful and viable tactic despite the danger (you<br/>
&gt;WILL take damage when you go in to use Chords with most MOBs).  Now<br/>
&gt;apparently Verant is deciding it&#39;s an exploit.  Oh, I get it... it&#39;s a bug<br/>
&gt;that the monsters aren&#39;t as fast as us?  If they had better AI and tried to<br/>
&gt;run away instead of chasing us as we killed them, that would solve the<br/>
&gt;problem nicely... at least we&#39;d have a much harder time kiting groups, if<br/>
&gt;they split up.  On the other hand, it would be easier to kite those single<br/>
&gt;MOBs, as they&#39;d be running away giving us plenty of time to improve our<br/>
&gt;melee skills and sing them to death.  I see this an another excellent<br/>
&gt;example of Verant trying to limit the way we play the game without thinking<br/>
&gt;through all the repercussions.  They want us to group, so every viable<br/>
&gt;soloing strategy will slowly be whittled away, regardless of the effects<br/>
&gt;these changes have on 1) the internal consistency (i.e. believability) of<br/>
&gt;the world, or 2) other perfectly &quot;legal&quot; actions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;May your feet ever be fleet,<br/>
&gt;And your voices ever be sweet.<br/>
