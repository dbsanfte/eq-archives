<div id="ygrps-yiv-398831294">1) its a back item, not shoulder.<br/>
2) its haste is over 2x that of a fbss (35% v 15%)<br/>
<br/>
as far as HP or mana items being useless, that is just the opposite.  since<br/>
stats don&#39;t do as much as we thought, ac and +hp items are the most<br/>
important thing for melee classes now.  hard to find a smart melee class not<br/>
wearing two 5ac 55hp rings.  even i wear them now.  and ask any caster with<br/>
over 200 int or wis, everything else is filled with +mana items.  if you<br/>
don&#39;t have a CoF, the hooded black cloak is what everyone wants for its nice<br/>
AC, +str, and +hp.  these things are going for 17k+ now on my server.  it&#39;s<br/>
the new cloak of shadows so to speak, as that used to go for a ton when<br/>
people thought dex was important for hitting (as opposed to only procing).<br/>
while maybe not spectacular, the cloak of flames has nice AC, nice hp boost,<br/>
and highest haste item other than the massively rare monk only rakusha cloak<br/>
off inno (55%).  i think it is more than worthy for a nag loot.<br/>

&gt; Take a look at this item:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cloak of Flames (off Lord Nagafen)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; AC 10  Dex +9 Agi +9 HP: +50 sv FIRE +15<br/>
&gt; Effect: Haste<br/>
&gt; WT: 0.1<br/>
&gt; All/All<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, so here we have an item that drops off one of the hardest <br/>
&gt; mobs in the<br/>
&gt; game.  It should be a pretty good item.  AC 10 for a shoulder <br/>
&gt; slot item is<br/>
&gt; &#39;ok&#39; (crafted pauldrons is better; even crested is better). <br/>
&gt; Dex/Agi +9 would<br/>
&gt; be damn nice if those stats did anything. HP +50 &lt;cough&gt; what <br/>
&gt; is the HP buff<br/>
&gt; from a Bloodstone symbol? Jasper? Peridot? And Sv FIRE + 15 <br/>
&gt; is damn nice but<br/>
&gt; were they thinking this will be usefull for camping Naggy?  <br/>
&gt; You need the<br/>
&gt; Fire resist before you take Naggy not after &lt;sheesh&gt; And <br/>
&gt; Haste is damn nice<br/>
&gt; effect no matter what.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s like they had some idea about dex/agi/str etc all being <br/>
&gt; meaningful but<br/>
&gt; somehow lost something along the way.  Any item boosters they <br/>
&gt; give to HP or<br/>
&gt; Mana are all jokes. </span></blockquote></div>
