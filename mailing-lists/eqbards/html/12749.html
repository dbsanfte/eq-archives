&gt;&gt; How do you use it?  I cannot get it to work...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve used this a lot:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Target an NPC.<br/>
&gt;2.  Sing the song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Notes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Counters can get in the way.  You&#39;ll see a failure message (target is<br/>
&gt;too far away?  target is not visible?  not sure, but you&#39;ll see one).<br/>
&gt;Stand next to him/her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.  It&#39;s a wind-based song, it will be better when you can use your flute<br/>
&gt;(which you will really only be able to practice when you get underwater<br/>
&gt;song).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3.  It raises the /con level of the target, but it might not raise it<br/>
&gt;enough to change the text.  Since I assume that it gets better with<br/>
&gt;leveling, and you&#39;re low, this might be playing a part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4.  It&#39;s possible for your charisma to be high enough that you already<br/>
&gt;have the best available price, and changing the /con won&#39;t make a<br/>
&gt;difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5.  It affects ALL members of a faction within the same zone at the time<br/>
&gt;you sing it, so once you&#39;ve done it to one merchant, you&#39;ve probably<br/>
&gt;changed the rest already (since, for the most part, they&#39;re all the same<br/>
&gt;faction).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6.  If you sing it to a member of another faction, you lose your effect<br/>
&gt;with any previous faction you&#39;ve sung it to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;7.  It appears to last until you zone, although it&#39;s possible that it is<br/>
&gt;just very long-lasting.<br/>
