Been playing a druid lately - invis has a MAJOR problem now - if you are<br/>
invis - and someone casts on you - anything - the icon doesn&#39;t go away, but<br/>
mobs can see you - songs pulsing probably work the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Why do I consider this a bug?  Well, thinking you are invis - and not is a<br/>
problem - it also opens the door to being pk&#39;d via monster.<br/>
<br/>
Also - harmony does it too - and harmony has a LARGE area of effect. I&#39;ve<br/>
accidentally uninvis&#39;d folks in unrest by harmony on a totally different<br/>
floor - while they were above or below invis.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;You can&#39;t anymore. My enchanter, who has both spells, has tried to do<br/>
&gt;so on her groupmates. One overwrites the other (whichever is cast last<br/>
&gt;overwrites the first) </span></blockquote></div>
