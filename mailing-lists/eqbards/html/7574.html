&gt; Working in a corporation, I would have to disagree with you.<br/>
&gt; And I&#39;d say real life has it&#39;s levels too..  :) Examples:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 15 - Apprentice Driver&#39;s License<br/>
&gt; Level 16 - Driver&#39;s License<br/>
&gt; Level 18 - Adult License<br/>
&gt; Level 21 - Drinking License<br/>
&gt; Level 65 - Retirement License<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are yes/no things, not a gradual scale.  Level based<br/>
systems use a gradual scale in lieu of skill scales.<br/>

&gt; That pretty much says that most of the things argued or <br/>
&gt; discussed on this list are pointless. If nothing else,<br/>
&gt; it makes us all feel better to be able to vent and know<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, almost all the other discussion I see on this list is<br/>
about how to play your bard better or what to expect at later<br/>
levels.  Aside from a few rants that span a few posts, and a<br/>
few attempts at meta-issue discussion I&#39;ve tried to start<br/>
which promptly got kabonged :-), the only exception I&#39;ve seen<br/>
is for what to put in the petition we&#39;re sending to Verant.<br/>
