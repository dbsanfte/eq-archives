<div id="ygrps-yiv-725097457">Loot is GREAT on forest giants.<br/>
<br/>
We picked up:<br/>
Forest Loop (AC 2 Dex 3 Wis 3 Agi 3 earring, All/All coveted even by 50s<br/>
in my guild)<br/>
emerald<br/>
Peridot<br/>
*Black Pearl*<br/>
2 different magical weapons (Stats weren&#39;t good though)<br/>
<br/>
Experience was good enough to keep a 6 person group happy for<br/>
two nights in a row there.<br/>
<br/>
We had people (including our healer) as low as 18 in the group -- 18 24<br/>
Our druid complained (at 18) that none of her spells were sticking<br/>
very well (even after Tashani) But it worked for casting spells on the<br/>
groupmates.<br/>
<br/>
I HIGHLY recommend going and fighting giants. It was sucha  thrill to be<br/>
fighting<br/>
the things that I&#39;ve heard the 50s in my guild fight for so long -- Giants!<br/>

&gt;LoIO is awesome.  Lots of spawns, good spacing.  Easy to solo, good to<br/>
&gt;group.  Easy to get to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are out for a lark, you can also try the forest giants in Warslik&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Woods (lotsa fun to kill giants at such a low level!).  I did that a few<br/>
&gt;nights ago and it was fun.  Not sure how good the exp was (didn&#39;t kill very<br/>
&gt;many was short on time) or the loot, but the novelty was great!  Getting<br/>
&gt;Warslik&#39;s Woods isn&#39;t bad either, since you can go through the goblin mines<br/>
&gt;in LoIO invis.<br/>
