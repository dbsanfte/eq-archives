&gt; Can you say &quot;expansion pack&quot; ?? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>According to quotes from Brad, the expansion pack only needed artists,<br/>
and not coders, as it&#39;s based on the same code that the main game runs.<br/>
He could have been lying I suppose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well P4 beta was a little over a month, but I think that was mainly<br/>
stress testing and final fix up testing. Even there, there are still<br/>
bugs many of us reported back in P4 in the game. The bard songs above<br/>
L20 weren&#39;t even in P4 on any vendor until the second last day of the<br/>
test.<br/>
<br/>
Betas before P4 were limited to about 350 people if I recall.<br/>
