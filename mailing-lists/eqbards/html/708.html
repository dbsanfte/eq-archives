 </span></blockquote>I like what Sam says, especially the encouragement to go for light but<br/>
effective, high-class armor and strength-enhancing magic items.  For me<br/>
that fits better with my concept of a bard.  It doesn&#39;t seem right to me<br/>
for a bard to be dressed like a tank in full plate.  I&#39;d far rather see<br/>
bards dressed in things that are light, effective, and exotic.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I spent money on two gold earring that don&#39;t even show unless<br/>
you inspect me closely and give me no improvements.  They fit my concept.<br/>
I look forward to trading them for something equally charismatic and with a<br/>
practical touch of magic.<br/>
<br/>
I split my extra stat points mostly among strength, which I figured was<br/>
good for my fighter side, and charisma, which has been good for my ability<br/>
to make money and fits perfectly with my concept of a bard as the charming,<br/>
rogueish musician who&#39;s pretty good in a fight.  As I recall I may have put<br/>
some into agility, too, as some of those rogueish skills could someday<br/>
prove quite useful.<br/>
<br/>
I find a deep sense of character an important enhancement to raw capability<br/>
and ultimately the higher driving force.<br/>
