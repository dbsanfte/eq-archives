<div id="ygrps-yiv-401203696">Strangely enough I&#39;ve never heard someone talking about how great their<br/>
class gets AFTER level 35.  It seems that every class has major gripes and<br/>
what REALLY is wrong is level 35 and up?  Besides, don&#39;t forget Selo.  I<br/>
just traded for my MM drums and I&#39;m FLYING.  I would imagine the twisting<br/>
some magic resist songs will never become useless, and I planning on<br/>
twisting heal and mana when I hit 32...<br/>
<br/>
On another note, my brother&#39;s first encounter with the Predator yielded an<br/>
obsidian shard which I thoroughly enjoyed for days... then some darn level<br/>
50 shaman gave me an offer for it I couldn&#39;t refuse: an obsidian scimitar,<br/>
an obsidian hoop, a chipped bone bracelet, a +4 wis +4 dex? veil, and 200<br/>
plat.  I immediately turned around and traded the obsidian hoop to another<br/>
level 50 for azure sleeves and gave the veil, sleeves, and bracelet to my<br/>
brother&#39;s druid.  The scimitar is decent, but I miss my shard!  I never saw<br/>
any stamina loss when I was duel wielding my dragoon dirk and the shard.<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to camp the predator now for the last 3 nights and haven&#39;t<br/>
seen anything but place holder spawns.  Anyone have advice on how to get the<br/>
predator to spawn?<br/>

&gt; &gt; At times I wish I could hit as hard as my wife&#39;s warrior, or do crowd<br/>
&gt; &gt; control as well as my buddy&#39;s enchanter, or snare as well as my<br/>
&gt; brother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; druid or friend&#39;s ranger, or buff as well as my friend&#39;s<br/>
&gt; shaman...  but who<br/>
&gt; &gt; else can do it ALL?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You will certainly do it all later on in your career. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Your chains wont matter, your charm doesnt work anymore, pixie<br/>
&gt;   strike doesnt hold monsters well enough, you are like a mosquito<br/>
&gt;   pricking the enemy with your tiny axe and dirk, and people will<br/>
&gt;   say &quot;why am I going beserk - what is a burst of strength/speed?&quot;<br/>
&gt;   Lullaby?  Damn, I forgot I even had that... what level was it again?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You will be reduced to nothing but a L32 bard with your manasong =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Can you play manasong?<br/>
&gt;   Hey can you twist in manasong during battle?<br/>
&gt;   Are you playing manasong?<br/>
&gt;   Don&#39;t bother with anything else but manasong.<br/>
&gt;   Hey, my mind isn&#39;t clearing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Your future gets much better &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Sacastically,<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic, currently twisting Psalm/Cooling, Berserk, Manasong ;)<br/>
