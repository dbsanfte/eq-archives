<div id="ygrps-yiv-947943440">Cost me about 300 plat to get to 101 skill, and with the song going, I was<br/>
making tunics at 42 skill.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I didn&#39;t start until I was 22nd level, and I&#39;m pretty sure levels<br/>
have a bearing on the sucess roll as well, and my Chant of Battle boosted me<br/>
to 130 STR and 125 DEX using a drum.<br/>
<br/>
Actual cost was higher, but since I was making sellable pieces very quickly,<br/>
300 was my out of pocket.  Once I hit master, and had me and my groupmates<br/>
in banded, I quit.   I&#39;ve no real interest in going into business, I make<br/>
plenty of money adventuring.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s nice to know I can whip up a full set for about 50 plat.<br/>

&gt;&gt;So what you end up with is a bard with a lot of surplus training points.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;&gt;put all I could into smithing, as bards make one of the best smiths (STR<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;&gt;DEX are key stats for smiths, and if you smith while singing Chant of<br/>
Battle<br/>
&gt;&gt;and playing your drum, you have much better stats there than most<br/>
&gt;&gt;un-augmented races).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually I have seen that a players INT seemes to make a MUCH bigger<br/>
&gt;difference in smithing.  The skill of the smith seemes to play a larger<br/>
&gt;role in how well you can make items.  The people that will gain skill the<br/>
&gt;fastest are those with the higher intelligence.  Just try teaching a troll<br/>
&gt;a new language as opposed to an Erudite.<br/>
&gt;I know a Dark Elf Necromancer Smith that was able to get to 136+ (I say +<br/>
&gt;because that was his skill 2 or more weeks ago) skill, in about two weeks<br/>
&gt;time.  It cost him about 500 plat in materials to get that good.  Yes he<br/>
&gt;was selling the successes as well.  In that short time his skill has<br/>
&gt;apparently equaled or surpassed most of those persons on the server that<br/>
&gt;have been smithing since well before him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Str and Dex may help to some degree but if you want to gain skill you need<br/>
&gt;int.  I would hazard a guess to say that for someone under between 85 and<br/>
&gt;100 int it would probably cost 1000plat to get their skill up that high.<br/>
