customers at $10/mo, that&#39;s $1 million/mo.  If all the profits<br/>
were being reinvested in the game, they&#39;d have 40+ employees<br/>
working on it all with salaries around $100k/year, with<br/>
per-employee expenses running around $100k/year.  The numbers<br/>
were about the same for UO.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s for this reason that I think the first truly successful<br/>
persistent MMORPG will be made by a small company, not a giant<br/>
like EA or Sony or Microsoft.  So far, they&#39;ve all been<br/>
treating this genre like any other game - code it, sell it,<br/>
rake in the dough, slap on a few bug fixes.<br/>
