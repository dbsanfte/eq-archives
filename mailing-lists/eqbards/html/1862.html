 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d disagree with this.  If you&#39;re using different speed<br/>
weapons, the dual wield check seems to be asynchronous with<br/>
your primary weapon.  I&#39;ve watched several times as my<br/>
off-hand would swing, pause, primary, pause, off-hand, pause, <br/>
primary, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If this is correct and the dual wield check is made every<br/>
swing cycle of the off-hand weapon, then the weapon speed does<br/>
not matter.  If your dual wield goes off 30% of the time, then<br/>
it will increase your damage 30% regardless of what the weapon<br/>
speed is.<br/>
<br/>
*Most* of the times dual-wield succeeds it seems to be<br/>
sychronized, so there may be more to it.  Perhaps it only goes<br/>
asynchronous after a successful dual wield, and after a<br/>
failure the next check is synchronous with your primary hand?<br/>
That seems a rather convoluted way to program it; but if<br/>
that&#39;s the case, then Mr. Capozzi is correct, although the<br/>
increase in damage is not quite HUGE :-), and this advantage<br/>
becomes less the better you get at dual wield.<br/>
