<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005978651">I did a friendly duel with my level 21 warrior against a level 21 enchanter.<br/>
She didn&#39;t use charm (with charm it would have been no contest)  but all her<br/>
other spells.  She ran out of mana before I ran out of hit points.  I am<br/>
going to try a wizard here sometime this week and see the results.  I was<br/>
expecting to be fried by the enchanter,  but she yielded twice.  I expect to<br/>
be fried by the wizard too.  I&#39;ll let you know the results when I am done :)<br/>

&gt; Probably we have been nerfed.  Of course in my duel, the lag was not<br/>
&gt; exactly<br/>
&gt; ideal, like I said.  I am certain that Lullaby no longer &quot;Nixes S. List.&quot;<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have seen a noticeable change in the way this song behaves.  Grouped with<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; rogue, we made quite a team with this song and a backstab... no longer.<br/>
&gt; Try<br/>
&gt; dueling the caster again.  I cannot see any melee class winning a duel<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; a caster!  Casters rule EverQuest, plain and simple.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Wow that seemed od to me friend.  I dueled my level 21 wizard friend when<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was level 19 and he was in serious trouble.  An initial cast knocked me<br/>
&gt; &gt;silly for about 1 bubble of hp, but beyond that the battle degenerated<br/>
&gt; &gt;into him trying to cast Fade and me slapping  him with a dragoon<br/>
&gt; &gt;dirk/combine rapier while singing the lullaby.  If I had an off-hand<br/>
&gt; &gt;weapon that alternated I probably would have done better then I actually<br/>
&gt; &gt;did.  So we can easily stand toe to toe with casters.  BTW my friend was<br/>
&gt; &gt;interrupted about 95% of the time between the lullaby and the smacking he<br/>
&gt; &gt;was getting.  Mind you this was a while ago and Verant may have been kind<br/>
&gt; &gt;enough to nerf us.  I have read a number of threads that claim bards are<br/>
&gt; &gt;too powerful and that we need x song and x ability removed.  Another case<br/>
&gt; &gt;of envy and lack of knowledge.  I don&#39;t know about all of you, but I have<br/>
&gt; &gt;never felt overly powerful just extremely useful =).<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I dueled a level 17 wizard using this technique and it just plain<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; work!  Granted, I was in an ingredible laggy zone, was experiencing a<br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; amount of packet loss, and the wizard was running around, slippery<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; bugger (half the time I&#39;d see him standing one place when in reality my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; client was wrong and he was somewhere else).  But still, embarassing to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; bested by one a few levels bellow me.  I&#39;d never use Lullaby for this<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; purpose again, I didn&#39;t see him interupted once when I reviewed the<br/>
&gt; text.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe Lullaby would be more useful for this purpose with a shorter<br/>
&gt; period<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; between pulses.  Come to think of it, Mellifluos Motion might actually<br/>
&gt; serve<br/>
