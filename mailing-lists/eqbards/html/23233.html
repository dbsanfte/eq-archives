<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228205758">I did the hand room last night in Karnor.  When I started we had an<br/>
enchanter - which allowed us basically to pull trains and have them for<br/>
breakfast (literally had 3-5 mobs in the room for long periods of time)  We<br/>
pulled the warlord and his bodyguards for example.  Most amazing loot period<br/>
I saw.  I about 3 hours (maybe less) we got Druid Gloves, Cleric Boots,<br/>
Warrior, and Cleaver of Ogguk, (I forget the class item names).<br/>
<br/>
Then the enchanter left and I did crowd control.  Eventually a very good<br/>
necro joined us (one who knew how to group).  It worked great with the two<br/>
of us - since there were so many undeads.  He was the only necro I know who<br/>
used Undead Charm as Crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
I have tended to avoid Pixie Strike - but ended up using it in a key point -<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize I had forgotten to mem Charm after a rez.  In the past - I<br/>
had way to many resists; but these mobs were getting pretty blue - so the<br/>
resists weren&#39;t so bad.  I was almost able to keep 2 hands mezzed for a<br/>
while.  I was taking some damage -but we had a good cleric - so I was found.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty clear that the clerics who think that Complete Heal is their<br/>
bread-and-butter spell don&#39;t know what they are doing.  I feel a lot more<br/>
comfortable now when I see a cleric with a Remedy hotkey set up as soon as<br/>
he joins the group...<br/>

        &lt;snip&gt; Bertoxx Bards are enjoying a bit of a renaissance - I<br/>
typically see 18 in the 40-60 range and 30 or more from 1-39. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        I personally think that alot of the &quot;old&quot; bards are getting dusted<br/>
off and played with the new mezz song changes, song additions and such.  As<br/>
a level 55 bard, my friends are beginning to see me as a viable replacement<br/>
for an enchanter in many &quot;Exp groups&quot;.  With a combination of root parking<br/>
and bard mezzing, we can do some of the &quot;deeper&quot; areas of dungeons that have<br/>
historically been limited to only groups with enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
        My regular grouping buddies have commented that in the &quot;lower<br/>
stress&quot; mezzing situations..i.e. with 3 or less creatures requiring mezzes,<br/>
I am actually a better choice for mezzing since I have such low resists with<br/>
the level 53 song. Not to mention...I can take a hell of a lot more beating<br/>
than an enchanter can.<br/>
