<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581267492">hehe, this reminds me of the other night when i tried to do the hero bracer<br/>
quest.  my faction was not high enough, so hmm what do i do, he wont give me<br/>
the quest...  i head over to blackburrow and mem sleep song, go down to the<br/>
bridge/main room and then run around pull a huge train.  I want faction<br/>
baby.... i told everyone around me to kill what they wanted from it.  Well<br/>
lets just put it this way, Sleep affects way more then just 4.  I cause so<br/>
much spam it was crazy, and everyone was jumping gnolls that were so mad at<br/>
me putting them to sleep they were begging for more. Between the Head nod<br/>
spam and the faction spam, i lost maybe half a bub of health at the most in<br/>
all the trains i got (3-4 of em of 20+ gnolls). Everyone was having fun<br/>
around me.  Except this one snooty goodie two shoed nerdy erudian paladin<br/>
sends me a tell saying he&#39;s reported me for purposely making trains. so i<br/>
said out loud that i had asked everyone around if they minded them and they<br/>
all were backing me up and wanted more of em since they were getting lotsa<br/>
easy xp without getting hurt, not 1 person died in all my pulls since i had<br/>
a huge crowd of gnolls after me and very few of em actually left the mob of<br/>
em on me.  Then he tells me to F*** myself out loud.... i said fine, i just<br/>
did a /report and he promply logged out....  funny how you can never please<br/>
everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, i still wasnt able to do the quest even though amiable to me, i<br/>
think he dont like wood elves.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m starting to notice this more and more.  You can pretty much tell when<br/>
&gt; everyone in your group is attacking the same mob by their orientation<br/>
&gt; towards the mob.  A lot of the time, I get the &quot;head nods&quot; message for all<br/>
&gt; the mobs but the extra mobs that should be asleep keep attacking.  Very<br/>
&gt; disappointing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; mumble, mumble, mumble.  Pixie Strike is BROKEN.  So is Lullaby.  I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; TRYING to use Lullaby in Cazic-Thule last night and I&#39;d get a &quot;nods&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; message<br/>
&gt; &gt; for EVERY mob and then get hit by two or three.  This is really<br/>
&gt; &gt; aggravating.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s gotten so my groups are saying &quot;That song&#39;s not useful, quit using<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.&quot;<br/>
