<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901498158">A similar thing happened to me twice when I was camping behind the back<br/>
porch.  One time, my group was resting after a fight.  I had been using<br/>
Denon&#39;s Discord during the previous fight.  While everyone is resting, the<br/>
back door opens up and a festering hag makes a beeline towards me.  Next<br/>
thing I know she zaps me for 300+ hit points and I&#39;m dead.  If there is a<br/>
bug with the  axis whatever is it something that Verant is aware of and is<br/>
working on fixing?<br/>

	Last night in Unrest I camped off the side porch because there was a<br/>
	discussion that singing songs off the back porch might be affecting<br/>
mobs in<br/>
	the basement due to an unlimited Z axis affect bug.  I also did not<br/>
stand<br/>
	around and sing songs while our puller was in the house...I waited<br/>
until our<br/>
	kill was brought to the fence and whacked once or twice and then<br/>
kicked in<br/>
	my playlist.  This worked awesome and I did not die once.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think the bards invis song worked against undead.  I know for a<br/>
fact I have been attacked by zombies before while singing the song.  Can<br/>
someone clarify this please.<br/>
<br/>
	I think the people I group with generally recognize that I do a lot<br/>
as a	<br/>
	bard, shuffling instruments and weapons, jumping in and out of<br/>
physical<br/>
	melee, playing a variety of different songs, some &quot;simultaneously&quot;<br/>
- and<br/>
	they also recognize the benefit of our songs because I tell them<br/>
things like<br/>
	&quot;check out your magic resist&quot; and get the &quot;wholly crap!&quot; or invis<br/>
people<br/>
	while they are medding and they are amazed that it works against<br/>
undead too.<br/>
	Our party was sitting against the fence medding and watching a<br/>
Festering Hag<br/>
	run around the yard wasting people, finally being killed by a group<br/>
only 15<br/>
	feet away from us - we watched the whole thing as the group leader<br/>
nervously<br/>
	commented &quot;don&#39;t stop singing that song Faras...&quot;<br/>
