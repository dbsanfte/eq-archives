&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a few questions this morning for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1)  Which room in Mistmoore is the home of the gypsy lute dropping gypsies? <br/>
&gt;  How do I get there?  Is there a secret way (i.e. through the secret room <br/>
&gt;in the graveyard) which could be less hazardous to a group of around 30&#39;s? <br/>
&gt;(I too share Shada&#39;s propensity for being lost - hehe.  My train hotkey <br/>
&gt;shouts &quot;TRAIN TO......UM......Just watch out!&quot;)  Once I get to said room, <br/>
&gt;how difficult a place is it?  3 spawns, 4?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve gone in via the front door with a group then past the 2 gargoyles (not <br/>
up the stairs).  There is a room with a muscian pit where the gypsies spawn. <br/>
  At night they spawn as werewolves.  Not sure what the best way to break <br/>
the room is though, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;2)  Where are Choon and Froon (I&#39;ve spent the vast majority of my time on <br/>
&gt;the East coast, so I&#39;m not too familiar with the Karanas)?  About what <br/>
&gt;level are they?  Is it possible to pull one with out the other?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if you are 27+ just use Charm to have them kill each other. They are located <br/>
on the western hills in west karana, near the Orge camp.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And in another non-related vein:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone please post or supply the web address to a comprehensive list of <br/>
&gt;Bard skill caps?  And once more, where do you have to go to train that <br/>
&gt;first point in Instill Doubt?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To learn Instill Doubt go the the bard guildmaster in Freeport, he is on the <br/>
upstairs.<br/>
