<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584344698">I meant to post here but forgot.  When I&#39;m doing crowd control - I usually<br/>
hope for a 2-pull and use charm.  Was in a group with a Paladin and Rogue a<br/>
couple of weeks ago that were pretty high level on the North Wall of Karnor.<br/>
I replaced an enchanter - they had no probs with 3-pulls.  I tried pixie<br/>
strike to alternate between the two &quot;extras&quot; and tried to keep them both<br/>
mezzed.  The resists made it useless.  The Paladin Died and the rogue and I<br/>
zoned into Karnors (The Rogue&#39;s primary was a +49 Cleric so it was no big<br/>
woop).<br/>
<br/>
I was 44 at the time - and there&#39;s nothing above a blue (although I think it<br/>
was &quot;High-Blue&#39;s&quot; I was trying to mez if that makes a difference).  I WAS<br/>
using my Mino Horn.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe (but not sure) there was no secondary resist message...<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] secondary resists<br/>

<br/>
Anyone notice a change in Pixie Strike?  I have used it before and gotten<br/>
resisted quite a bit, but last night was the first time I ever saw the<br/>
secondary resist message like Lullaby has.  Was this added at the same time<br/>
as Lullaby&#39;s was or later?  It was taking me 3-4 applications to get it to<br/>
stick which made it useless for mezzing casters.  Granted I was using it on<br/>
high blues and whites, but why would I want to mez a green caster that<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand up to the group for 20 seconds anyhow???<br/>
<br/>
I was singing nothing but Pixie Strike against a blue necro trying to hold<br/>
her off while the group was busy and the necro was able to keep me almost<br/>
continually stunned with fear while I was only able to interrupt her once or<br/>
twice.  Looks like this is another song I will demem until they fix it.<br/>
When fighting high blues and whites it has not worked well enough to be<br/>
worthwhile.<br/>
