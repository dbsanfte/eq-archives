and components which are very rare and difficult to obtain -<br/>
roughly as difficult as or rarer than equipment like the FBSS.  <br/>
A lot of the high level mages and necros are using lower level<br/>
pets because they simply haven&#39;t obtained the items needed for<br/>
their higher level pet spells.  So the correct comparison is<br/>
between L49 pet and L49 warrior with equipment typical for<br/>
that level.  (Actually, the correct comparison would be L49<br/>
necro and L49 pet vs L49 warrior.  We&#39;re already being<br/>
massively conservative comparing the warrior to just the pet.)<br/>
