&gt; &gt;I honestly don&#39;t know why this bothers ppl to this extent. When you get <br/>
&gt;lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt;50 and you get SO sick and tired of seeing the insides of Guk and Sol B,<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt;can&#39;t find a group, nothing is going on, and you got all this extra loot<br/>
&gt; &gt;sitting around not being used - why not use it? Trust me when you get <br/>
&gt;50th<br/>
&gt; &gt;you will feel the same way. The ONLY lvl 50 people I know that haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;twinked a character were unable to because they are on other servers. You<br/>
&gt; &gt;get sick of being a newbie, and twinking makes it much easier to get <br/>
&gt;passed<br/>
&gt; &gt;this very boring phase of a newbie&#39;s life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;When I first got EQ I had a blast being a newbie, learning the ropes,<br/>
&gt; &gt;running from little goblins and orcs. Now - I would skip directly to lvl <br/>
&gt;14<br/>
&gt; &gt;(at least) if I could. I&#39;ve been a newbie so many times (many times <br/>
&gt;forced<br/>
&gt; &gt;by character deletions during beta and then commercial release) it just<br/>
&gt;does<br/>
&gt; &gt;NOT appeal to me anymore in the slightest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Full quest armor on a twink? Be happy they got it and probably won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; &gt;going after that item anymore should you also happen to be interested in<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;same quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I also have no problems grouping with twinked people because I know they<br/>
&gt; &gt;have nice stuff that helps give them an edge. =) This translates directly<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;how well your party can do. Currently I&#39;m wearing enough WIS crap on my<br/>
&gt; &gt;druid to get at least 2 extra bubbles of mana. This is a huge difference<br/>
&gt; &gt;than what I would have if untwinked, and I feel more comfortable with it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The ONLY times I have had any problem whatsoever with a twink was when I<br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt;sitting in Oasis, and I saw an Ogre stroll up to me with this neat lookin<br/>
&gt; &gt;sword (looked like a Wakizashi). I noticed he was 14th level so I <br/>
&gt;inspected<br/>
&gt; &gt;him....WTF?!?! A Bladestorm!??!?!?!?!?! This is where I draw the line...I<br/>
&gt; &gt;mean come on - weapons that are dropped from a god? I am so glad they<br/>
&gt; &gt;implemented the level limit. My first time in Fear was just after the <br/>
&gt;level<br/>
&gt; &gt;cap patch. I was with Fires of Heaven (a guild with a notorious <br/>
&gt;reputation<br/>
&gt; &gt;on my server), and a mob dropped some Ranger only no drop boots. Hmmm no<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ranger around...so the guy leading the hunt logged in his newbie-gimp<br/>
&gt;ranger<br/>
&gt; &gt;(sub-20th level I believe) and looted the boots. He had this ranger <br/>
&gt;camped<br/>
&gt; &gt;there before the level limits were imposed. He did not know that Caphys,<br/>
&gt; &gt;Veeshan&#39;s lead GM was watching us invisible until Caphys said to remove <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt;low level characters from the zone. Of course this guy was not really<br/>
&gt; &gt;reprimanded in any way because FoH and the GMs on my server are in the<br/>
&gt;sack,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but that&#39;s a whole different story - I digress.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I can understand people being jealous of items other characters twinks<br/>
&gt;have.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hell, my in-game spouse has a 17th level rogue with a sash, silver<br/>
&gt; &gt;legplates, BONE RAZOR, and other awesome stuff.. I drool and I give her<br/>
&gt;hell<br/>
&gt; &gt;for it all the time, but it&#39;s all in fun. =) Just wait til you are 50th <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;start feeling that eq boredom  creep in and you pain for something new to<br/>
&gt; &gt;do. I&#39;m sure not everyone will do it, but the majority will either twink <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt;new char or quit EQ.<br/>
