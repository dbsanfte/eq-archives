<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619051054">Charm him before you hand in the note.  This is a pretty common tactic for<br/>
any quest where the questgiver is KoS.  I&#39;ve done this several times,<br/>
including with Mahlin, and it works fine.<br/>

<br/>
on another note... has anyone started their epic quest? or a better question<br/>
yet, has anyone attempted to give Maligar the note to him? well seeing he&#39;s<br/>
kos, it makes it a challenge. <br/>
&lt;clipped&gt;<br/>
so now i have no note (not impossible to get again, just not worth it)...<br/>
but was wondering if you need to have him under charm,like gix in commons,<br/>
to get the note for thex mallet quest.  if anyone has the note, or is about<br/>
to get it, inform us of your success, not a carbon copy of this =)<br/>
