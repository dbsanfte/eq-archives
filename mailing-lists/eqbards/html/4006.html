&gt;So what should I get?  My piercing skill is prolly higher than my 1hs. So I<br/>
&gt;was thinking a combine dagger.  Or a whip (kewl dood sound effects &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

&gt;p.s. I also got sneak!  how does that work?  makes you kinda invisible?  or<br/>
&gt;changes attitude of monster? someone said you can play songs and sneak -<br/>
&gt;what about run? can you run and sneak?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sneak seems to effect the radius at which mobs notice you, or more likely<br/>
just lets you come up behind them without them seeing you (rogues use it for<br/>
backstabbing).  My rogue friend, however, told me that it now functions<br/>
similar to invisibility on the test server.  Use the skill a few levels<br/>
there, until it becomes obsolete by a song.<br/>
