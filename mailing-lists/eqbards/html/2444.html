<div id="ygrps-yiv-712608917">Ok, this is slightly off topic, but since I&#39;m a Bard and we all get<br/>
cooking, I thought I&#39;d ask anyway. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve finally gotten my hands on some recipes and got into working on<br/>
cooking, mainly doing things that are free to make, minus time to<br/>
collect materials (edible goo, fish rolls, etc.) and I got to wondering<br/>
after getting a feel for the prices merchants would buy and sell these<br/>
items for:  &#39;Does some food items last longer than others?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve hunted around on the web for clues on this, but all I keep finding<br/>
is that people eat twice a day (morning and night).  So, is there any<br/>
benefit in making say fish fillets (pretty spendy items from a merchant)<br/>
when it&#39;s cheaper to just fish or buy simple rations?<br/>
<br/>
Curious Bard wants to know. :)<br/>
