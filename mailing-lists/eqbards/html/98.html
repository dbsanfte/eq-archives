<br/>
A couple of comments:<br/>
<br/>
Although 10 platinum is hard to earn at the lower levels, if you focus your<br/>
efforts, you&#39;ll find that it only takes a few hours around your 7th or 8th rank<br/>
to earn that much.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for those of you who are interested in benifitting earlier, here is a<br/>
direct quote from our Academy application page regarding student&#39;s tuition:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Soerbaird must pay a tuition of 10 platinum to enter the Academy. Upon<br/>
graduation from the Academy, a monthly fee will be exacted from each member<br/>
according to their station. For those of you with questions about the fee,<br/>
please mail Jythri.<br/>
<br/>
The initial fee for joining the guild is only 1 platinum. The rest of the 10<br/>
platinum tuition is due upon your reaching 10th level.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Please note that this text is not hidden or clouded in anyway, and that upon<br/>
your initial entry in the guild, you are only required to pay 1 platinum, with<br/>
the rest paid later. I paid my 1 platinum at level 2, with most of the other<br/>
Ollave, so I know it can be done. For the record, I also paid my remaining 9<br/>
platinum into the guild treasury at level 8, within the first week and a half<br/>
of Norrath&#39;s awakening.<br/>
<br/>
The fee is high, yes, but so are our standards. We expect much from our bards,<br/>
and the willingness to contribute to the guild is one of the first tests they<br/>
must pass.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re considering applying to our guild, please read our Academy<br/>
Application information (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com/academy/default.htm)">http://www.soerbaird.com/academy/default.htm)</a><br/>
carefully, because we abide strictly by what is written there.<br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;    I now have just a couple of questions.  First regarding the Soerbaird<br/>
&gt;Guild.  I am very proud that members of my calling would have such<br/>
&gt;altruistic ideals, but I would like to ask how newer students could afford<br/>
&gt;10 PP?  I have just recently achieved the 7th level of ascendance and I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t think I have ever had 10 PP.  Of course money has never been high on<br/>
&gt;my list priorities.  I tend to lean toward the virtues of Wine, Women and<br/>
&gt;Song. </span></blockquote></div>
