<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Harm&#39;s just cranky because he promised me he would get me a Lambent Helm,<br/>
&gt; and he had to kill 25 DW goblins to get the Opoline helm to make it<br/>
&gt; with.  If I had to crank through 25 DW goblins, I&#39;d be irritated, too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, but doing that really improved my quality time with my ingame<br/>
  girlfriend ;-)  We had funny killing the silly goblins.  I&#39;ve got it<br/>
  down to a science now, I can pull them separately too.  I was just<br/>
  one unlucky bard.  Now I kinda wanna go back and get another helm<br/>
  so I can try to suit up in full black.  I have a charred bp, charred<br/>
  gloves, charred boots, if I get some legs and arms that are black<br/>
  I can toss on some silver bracers and look like an SK when illusioned.<br/>
  hehehe.  I need to find one of those 2h bone bladed axes that have BRD<br/>
  on them.  Didn&#39;t someone say if we wield a certain item, it looks like<br/>
  an exe axe?<br/>
