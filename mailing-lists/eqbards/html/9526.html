<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477464113">&#39;No Drop&#39; for quest components is a good idea, but making the final quest<br/>
reward &#39;No drop&#39; is a rip since you usually don&#39;t know what you will get<br/>
when you start the quest.  I couldn&#39;t care less if the items along the way<br/>
in the quest were &#39;no drop&#39; because I plan on keeping them to complete the<br/>
quest anyhow.  Having the reward be &#39;no drop&#39; and incredibly restricted in<br/>
its usability just makes quests less worthwhile.  From what I have seen very<br/>
few people do quests anyhow so I doubt this would break any item rarity<br/>
overmuch.  I even traded a Shining Star of Light to a 38th level cleric from<br/>
Qeynos who could easily have done the quest but didn&#39;t want to lose valuable<br/>
camping time.<br/>

&gt; Personally I also hate letting items go to waste, but it at least fits<br/>
&gt; in with Verant&#39;s appearant philosophy of keeping items rare <br/>
&gt; by any means<br/>
&gt; possible. If they didn&#39;t have the items no drop, they&#39;d <br/>
&gt; probably cut the<br/>
&gt; spawn of items even more to assure that everyone didn&#39;t have one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also think they implemented the &quot;NO DROP&quot; flag to minimize the amount of<br/>
&quot;farming&quot; & &quot;harvesting&quot; of items.  Without it, you know that there would be<br/>
people camping quest item spawns and then attempting to sell the items.  &quot;NO<br/>
DROP&quot; isn&#39;t the perfect solution, but I consider it to be the lesser of two<br/>
evils.  In fact, from what I understand of the game mechanics I don&#39;t think<br/>
they could come up with an ideal solution without a major overhaul of the<br/>
entire system.  Also, in a FRPG milieu, it makes perfect sense to keep<br/>
certain items rare and unique - unfortunately, most people consider it their<br/>
birthright to eventually own these particular items simply because they<br/>
exist - and they&#39;ll go to great lengths to obtain them.  If every rare item<br/>
was dropped all the time, it would just be a matter of time before everyone<br/>
in the game had the best equipment (for their class) with little regard for<br/>
level.<br/>
