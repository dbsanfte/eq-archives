<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863586168">Hiya all,<br/>
<br/>
just thought I&#39;d let you all know how my Lambent armor questing has been<br/>
going..........<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent the last week or so questing for Lambent armor and have gained<br/>
little experince and am still at level 28 (1 bubble) but I have nearly<br/>
completed all the quests, so far I have got the Greaves, Vambraces, Gloves<br/>
and Boots myself. I did buy the BP but there was a good reason for it.<br/>
<br/>
Now all I need is the Bracers and Helm to complete the full suit (may not<br/>
wear them all the time because I think that there is other better stuff).<br/>
They will be for Roleplaying use and whenever I want to look good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got the Dark boned Bracelet so far, but how hard are the Grif charms<br/>
and the stuff for the helm to get?? I&#39;ve never been to Cazic btw.<br/>
<br/>
Not too fussed about the above missing items and will concentrate on making<br/>
a few levels.<br/>
