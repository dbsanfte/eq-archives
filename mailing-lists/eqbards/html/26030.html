<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344114118">Easy.  Charm a mob, have it attack another.  Monitor both mobs so that the<br/>
uncharmed one doesn&#39;t kill your pet (no xp).  Preferably, charm the tougher<br/>
mob, and have it hit the weaker.  When your pet kills the mob, your pet<br/>
should also be low health, at which point you finish it off using whatever<br/>
other method at your disposal.<br/>
<br/>
Swarm kiting is a variation on the theme, where your pet is beat on by a<br/>
swarm of mobs.  Trick is to break charm just before your pet dies, and then<br/>
finish him off (while avoiding your swarm...heh).  Then charm the next, let<br/>
the swarm beat on him...etc.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the basics of what.  To truly learn how, experience is the only<br/>
way.  You&#39;ll soon see how it works, and find the style that fits you.<br/>
