falling to the ground level.  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have anything trained<br/>
in Safe fall =(.  Time to go and train I guess =).  BTW my group w just<br/>
continued to sit there after I ran and the were not attacked.  Luckily one<br/>
of the casters fizzled while trying to cast on the hag.  If it was<br/>
successful you would have seen more people flying of the roof Unrest.<br/>
