<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575220868">buying rights...  I know people were yelling that free carapaces and runes<br/>
in CT and guk when they were killing the stuff. So dont go and spend your<br/>
fortunes on every item, remember, if a group is just camping the items for<br/>
xp, means they all have the items allready or dont need em, so they couldnt<br/>
care less about em since they&#39;re all no drop except for the Lambent stones.<br/>
I say within a week you&#39;ll be able to loot everything for free practically<br/>
if the groups camping them is just going for xp<br/>
<br/>
last night i saw 2 runes being givin away in CT but i was too far away in<br/>
the temple to make it there<br/>
and also a carapace in guk but every run we made there we had to gate out<br/>
because of people making trains of greater iced bones. and finally when we<br/>
got to the gargs, we killed 2 of em, and got no carapace.<br/>
<br/>
People are leaving the shin leggings and shin gloves on the corpses of the<br/>
froggies. These are groups that cant go deep in the dungeon and just hunt<br/>
the zone line, where they pull tons of this stuff, thats where i got my shin<br/>
pants and my buddy looted some free gloves....<br/>

&gt; &gt;Until I gain 4-5 more levels, the only way I will be able to acquire any<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the bard quest components is to purchase the looting rights from someone.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Because these are all new items, the market for them hasn&#39;t really been<br/>
&gt; &gt;established yet.  As a result, I don&#39;t have a really good idea on how<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; &gt;PP to offer for the looting rights.  If anyone out there gets a quest<br/>
&gt; &gt;component by paying for the looting rights, request you post how much you<br/>
&gt; &gt;paid for it.  That will give me and other bards in my situation a good<br/>
&gt; &gt;starting point in our negotiations.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks<br/>

&gt; I can understand wanting to get Lambent armor as soon as you can.  <br/>
&gt; Personally though I do not plan on buying any of the components (except<br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; the gems of course), why?  Well nearly all the equipment I have, I have <br/>
&gt; acquired by trading, purchasing, or as gifts from friends.  For Lambent I <br/>
&gt; want the satisfaction of killing and looting these items myself.  If it <br/>
&gt; takes me long longer then other folks so be it, but it&#39;s just what I feel<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; the right way to go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for prices on some of the items, I would guess for the first few weeks <br/>
&gt; the looting rights may be expensive.  Also some of the items are not bad<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; there own right (most seem to be at least plate AC and some have small <br/>
&gt; bonus).  If you want to buy you way want to wait a week or two for the <br/>
&gt; market to saturate. My guess may be in the 50 to 200 plat range depending<br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; the item.  Also remember that after 35th lvl or so most players stop<br/>
&gt; caring <br/>
&gt; about how much plat they have unless they are heavy into trade skills.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>
