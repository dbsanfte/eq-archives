<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-701887411">Hey all!  Good news for those us who like the Forage skill!  I was happily<br/>
running along today hitting my forage button as I always do, when I go the<br/>
message: You have become better at Forage (41).  Yippeee.  They have raised<br/>
the skill cap on forage.  I had to log out before I found out what the max<br/>
was, but I thought I&#39;d pass that along to you all.<br/>
