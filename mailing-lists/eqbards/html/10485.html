&gt; &gt; Do any of our great bards out there have some good ideas for dungeon<br/>
&gt; &gt; crawling for a 20th going on 21st level bard?  I&#39;ve been hunting a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; outdoors, and can make money pretty fast now if I need to, so I&#39;m more<br/>
&gt; &gt; interested in going somewhere that might have interesting loot items.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have considered Solusek&#39;s Eye but not sure if I am high enough to do well<br/>
&gt; &gt; there.  Any other suggestions?  I can solo high blues even I have found<br/>
&gt; &gt; since I reached 20th, but prefer to group.  Would there be groups in Sol A<br/>
&gt; &gt; that would be the right levels for me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that Sol A would be a little too tough at that level.  You would have to <br/>
fight near the entrance, and a) there aren&#39;t enough goblins there to be useful, <br/>
b) you&#39;ll be trained, c) you&#39;ll fall in the lava and d) the goblins you can beat <br/>
will not drop much of interest.  (I had a GREAT time in Sol A the other night, <br/>
though, grouped with 5 other level 30-34s, and a level 42 ranger.  We kept the <br/>
King room, the foyer and the next room clear with the 30s - the ranger soloed <br/>
stuff deeper, pulled some for us, and used us as backup.  Got an Evil Eye bag <br/>
full of FS, about 60pp in cash, arms for the Bard armor, and the Ring of the <br/>
Goblin Lord (we had three of them drop).  Plus 2+ bubbles in maybe 7 hours.  <br/>
Perhaps the best pickup group I&#39;ve played with, even if the entire party did get <br/>
wiped once.  I couldn&#39;t even COUNT how many goblins there were...)<br/>
<br/>
I also think that Cazic is too tough at your level, and Permafrost is too empty <br/>
- you would need to prearrange a group.  Your best bet is probably Unrest, and <br/>
maybe Upper Guk (train city there, too).</div>
