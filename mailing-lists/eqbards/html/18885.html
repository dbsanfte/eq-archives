<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624769219">Shin Gauntlets drop off of Shin Knights. Any Shin Knight will do. The<br/>
highest concentration is near the zone on the live side, so I&#39;d suggest<br/>
going there. On my server, this area is severely undercamped.<br/>
<br/>
Shin Greaves drop off of Shin Ghoul Knights. Again, any Shin Ghoul Knight<br/>
will do. I&#39;d suggest hunting in the Bedroom of the Dead side. This room will<br/>
prove to be a little tough for you, so I&#39;d wait until you hit 30. On the<br/>
plus side, this is an awesome place to get through 30. The exp is non stop<br/>
with a good puller and generally spots open up pretty quick because there<br/>
are no good drops here. Also, if your puller is good, he&#39;ll pull the Basalt<br/>
Gargoyles as well and you could land yourself a Basalt Carapace.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not interested in fighting for your stuff, then I suggest buying 2<br/>
invis to undead potions. Use one to go to the Bedroom (BR). Wait until<br/>
greaves (and or carapace) drop. Then use the other to get out. Usually the<br/>
ramp leading down to the BR is clear, so you may not even need the potions,<br/>
particularly if you are on an older server.<br/>
<br/>
Mask of Deception drops off of the Ghoul Assassin. At level 30 you can<br/>
easily hold your own in this room. Directions from the zone to the dead side<br/>
of lower guk...<br/>
<br/>
Zone in and follow the hall. At the first fork (just down the ramp) turn<br/>
right. Continue down the hall till you come to the water. Hop in the water<br/>
and go right. Follow the tunnel until you surface. Now you are in the<br/>
Bedroom. At this point you should get invis to undead, you will need it.<br/>
There are 2 passages leading out of the Bedroom. Take the left one and<br/>
plaster your ass to the left hand wall. At the end of the passage is a small<br/>
room and a passage leading to the left. Turn left into the passage. (You are<br/>
hugging the left wall to stay out of agro range of the Vampire Bats since<br/>
they see through invis. Once in the second passage you want to hug the right<br/>
hand wall. Literally. You should be scraping your armor and making<br/>
horrendous sounds. You are doing this to avoid agroing the 5 Greater Ice<br/>
Boned Skeletons that also see through invis and invis to undead. At the end<br/>
of the passage you will see some stairs and a big open chamber. This is<br/>
commonly referred to as the bridge. Go straight accross and through the<br/>
arch. You are now in the tower. Take the first left (it&#39;s the only left) and<br/>
head staight. You will see a ladder. Go up the ladder and you are in the<br/>
Store Room, home to the Ghoul Assassin and the Ghoul Supplier.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck, it&#39;s a harrowing exp the first few times. But soon it will be<br/>
commonplace.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Some Guk questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I finally dragged Elfson away from Kunark (went from 20-26 in about two<br/>
weeks!).  Feeling confident, (25 was the first level I reached without<br/>
dying since 5, 26 was the second) I began my search for some lambent<br/>
armor.  After some unsuccesful searching, I decided to come here with<br/>
some questions...<br/>
<br/>
Basically with all these peices, I&#39;d like to know is there a specific<br/>
mob (IE the Shin Knight down the hall from the preist room) or will any<br/>
mob of that type drop the item I need.  Also any other advice you could<br/>
offer for getting them would be great. (like where to find them) (Most<br/>
of these peices are out my reach right now, but my guild has lots of mid<br/>
30&#39;s casters dying to get me to 32, so they are very eager to help me<br/>
get my lambent, (I assume they want me to get my butt back to ROK for<br/>
more levels))<br/>
<br/>
Dark Boned Bracelets (Greater DB skelly in Unrest)<br/>
Shin Greaves (Shin Knight, upper guk)<br/>
Shin Gauntlets (Ghoul Shin Knight, lower guk)<br/>
<br/>
Also since I am in Guk, I am trying to get the Mask of the Deceiver. <br/>
The person camping it on Saturday was willing to let me loot it, but I<br/>
could never find the room.  How do you ge there?  Will I make it with<br/>
invisibility?<br/>
<br/>
Well thanks for the help :)<br/>
