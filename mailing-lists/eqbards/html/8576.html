&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Crier Sharpsong, a 26th half-elf Bard on Fennin Ro.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been having a recurring problem getting my Brass skill up and would<br/>
&gt; like to ask people here about it.  I&#39;ve read time and again that I should<br/>
&gt; venture to Arena or a PvP area, start Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord and leave<br/>
&gt; it running indefinitely to increase my skill.  However, I have not been<br/>
&gt; successful in getting that to work.  Initially I went to Arena in Rathe Mts.<br/>
&gt; and tried this.  I had read that you only needed to be in the area, not<br/>
&gt; actually in the PvP area itself, so I equipped my Minotaur Horn,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is your problem, mino horns are wind instruments. I got my skill<br/>
maxed with a brass horn, standing in the Shady Swashbuckler&#39;s cave (way<br/>
near the back). Started it up, and work up 10 hours later to maxed brass<br/>
skill.</div>
