Any fans of &quot;that 70&#39;s show&quot;?  Well Red keeps calling his brother and his<br/>
sun a Dumb A**.<br/>
<br/>
Couple episodes ago he&#39;s talkin about his brother, nagging on and on that<br/>
he&#39;s Dumb, and he&#39;s also an A**. then they play this heavenly music like he<br/>
just got a brilliant idea... He&#39;s a Dumb A**.  I dunno, every time i hear<br/>
about certain Verant Employees playing with bards, i think of that little<br/>
scene now<br/>

today!<br/>
 <br/>

much is still broken and ignored!?<br/>

Hmm maybe I read the thread wrong but it seemed like Absor was going to<br/>
seriously look into it? Dunno, maybe I&#39;m an optimist. Not to say we<br/>
shouldn&#39;t raise a stink if in fact it happens cuz that would just plain<br/>
suck, specially for lev and invis ...<br/>
