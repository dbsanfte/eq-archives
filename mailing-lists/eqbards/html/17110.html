&gt; In all of those, you will find that a substitute class is<br/>
&gt; about 67%-80% as effective as the optimal class.  Except us.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that for what ever reason - it turns out that we are *NOT*<br/>
<br/>
an 80% cleric<br/>
an 80% enchanter<br/>
a 74% ranger<br/>
a 67% wizard<br/>
etc<br/>
etc<br/>
<br/>
We just are NOT that way. So saying &quot;Please Verant make us second best at<br/>
what *everyone* else does!&quot; just does not ring true to me. We do have a<br/>
little bit of a lot of things and some very specific things that no one else<br/>
is as good at (mana regen).<br/>
<br/>
Also, not everything is built on pure logic and numbers.  We have have<br/>
measurably &quot;3rd class&quot; numbers on some things yet when played right, we can<br/>
have an outstanding effect on improving the whole party.  Also, Verant is<br/>
not &quot;fair&quot; - Verant is evil(tm).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just distressed because high-level bard life is turning<br/>
&gt; out to be a bore.  Why do you think I&#39;ve been pushing the<br/>
&gt; envelope trying silly things like soloing the froglok noble?<br/>
&gt; I tried soloing two SKs simultaneously a couple nights ago<br/>
&gt; (and barely succeeded due to judicious use of Screech).<br/>
<br/>
Life at the high levels is considerably different.  There is no longer the<br/>
&quot;lets get a group together and do something&quot; option.  High level stuff is<br/>
lets get 3 groups and try to break Fear or Hate or go do Naggy.  Sky, heh.<br/>
What can I say there?  Plan on 3 days or more or spending a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
Lets see how this looks:  Solo 1 - 20/30; Group 20/30 - 47/50; Guild/Team<br/>
(multiple groups) 47/50 - ??  (I pick 47 since that is about normal time to<br/>
go to the planes.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What I loved about playing a bard in mid-levels was that I<br/>
&gt; constantly had to be making decisions and adjustments.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It was<br/>
&gt; exhilarating because it was so non-deterministic.  All you<br/>
&gt; could do was make decisions that best improved your<br/>
&gt; probability of success<br/>
<br/>
Go roll a bard on a PvP server or younger server.  Or like everyone else...<br/>
start a twink.  Or pray that expansion has something to offer.<br/>
