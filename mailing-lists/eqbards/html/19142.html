&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m done arguing this thread.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Who&#39;s arguing?  We&#39;re discussing the fact that the people who <br/>
&gt; are supposedly<br/>
&gt; in-the-know don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He didn&#39;t make a mistake; he just didn&#39;t know. Yes he admitted it, yes<br/>
&gt; people overreact and flame him for the merest slip-up but by his own<br/>
&gt; admission he has very little idea about issues pertaining to <br/>
&gt; Bards. This<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t do much to foster confidence in the people who play <br/>
&gt; Bards and who<br/>
&gt; hope that our issues will be dealt with little more than a <br/>
&gt; &quot;Doh! Shows you<br/>
&gt; how much I know about bard songs :)&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Like I said, if you can do the job better, go apply.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No thanks.  I think he does a great job of addressing a <br/>
&gt; myriad problems and<br/>
&gt; shrugging off more than his fair share of verbal abuse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He just needs to work on his Bards a bit more. ;)<br/>
