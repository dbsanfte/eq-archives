<div id="ygrps-yiv-807965618">I am in TOTAL agreement with you. This was my FIRST raid of further raids I<br/>
am i ill REQUIER that loot guidelings be set BEFORE hand.. or I wont go.. I<br/>
verymuch enjoyed the shouts &quot; WE NEED A BARD WE DONT HAVE ONE IN THIS GROUP<br/>
SOMEONE GIVE UP A BARD!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The reason I went at 40th level (with barely a death buffer)  was because a<br/>
couple of my 50th friends practically begged me to because their group didnt<br/>
have a bard in their group..:)<br/>
<br/>
Loot rules ahead of time are a must for me for me 2nd 3rd etc raids<br/>

&gt;I think if a class is able to use an item they should be included in the<br/>
&gt;random loot - PERIOD. Especially on a damn dragon raid where bards are very<br/>
&gt;likely to die and lose xp (I died 3 times on my last dragon raid and got<br/>
&gt;nothing out of it but lost xp - even with 49th level resses, but I had fun<br/>
&gt;which is what counts most). There are certain items that are caster/bard<br/>
&gt;(like the orb thing dropped by Magi Rokyl) that I would gladly pass on<br/>
&gt;randoming, but a haste belt? HAHA count me in. I have done my fair share of<br/>
&gt;camping stuff for friends helping others get things - which I am glad to<br/>

&gt;equipment available. But if I am going to be risking my ass losing my 50th<br/>
&gt;level xp buffer I better damn well be considered for Bard-useable loot that<br/>
&gt;I may be interested in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Example - I finally got my FBSS at lvl 49 after COUNTLESS hours and hours<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>

&gt;in loot order over the tanks and rogues who could make better use of it. I<br/>
&gt;finally got sick of camping frenzy (blah, I&#39;m just sick of Lower Guk in<br/>
&gt;general - I&#39;d be glad to never step foot in that hole again) and as we<br/>
&gt;camped frenzy each time I was included in the random loot roll. A monk<br/>
&gt;friend of mine who needed the sash was there with me and we rolled for it<br/>
&gt;when it finally dropped. He got a 93 out of 0 - 100. I rolled a 99. He<br/>
&gt;cried, i felt sorry for him. If I had not spent so much time camping that<br/>
&gt;bitch I would&#39;ve been glad to let him have it, but I have had my fill. I<br/>
&gt;will of course continue to help him camp the bastard because I feel I owe<br/>
&gt;him that much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The sash has greatly increased my melee potential. Especially while soloing<br/>
&gt;when I can&#39;t find a group (imagine that). It does make a difference for<br/>
&gt;bards - I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass what any other melee type says.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bards are a HUGE asset on dragon raids. I think it&#39;s VERY important to<br/>
&gt;establish looting guidelines before you even pass the dimplomat&#39;s doors in<br/>
&gt;perma or kill the Tranix in sol B. I for one would tell them to find<br/>
