In any case, had to chime in here.  JS, your point about being <br/>
overpowered and underpowered in different aspects of the game is well <br/>
taken.  However, this is the difficulty in determining what &quot;balance&quot; <br/>
really means.  The weights you place on the various aspects in <br/>
forming an overall balance picture are no more and no less completely <br/>
arbitrary than anyone elses.  Everyone has their favorite aspect they <br/>
want to be good at, and if bards aren&#39;t meeting the grade in that <br/>
particular aspect, at that particular time, then people get upset and <br/>
think they&#39;re underpowered.  It&#39;s as simple as that.  Stating that <br/>
bards are overpowered &quot;in general&quot; assumes that you have the perfect <br/>
set of weights to apply to each aspect that a bard is either good, or <br/>
not good at to arrive at an overall value.  This basically boils down <br/>
to opinion, and your opinion seems to be in the minority amongst most <br/>
bards.<br/>
<br/>
For each individual player, it comes to finding out what aspects of <br/>
the game bards are good at, and what they are not good at, and <br/>
applying that to their respective playing styles.  If they like the <br/>
fit, then they happily keep playing their bards.  If they don&#39;t, they <br/>
either play a different class, or the complain a lot, and keep <br/>
playing their bard.  Given the relatively small number of bards, and <br/>
the number of bards stop playing at a given level.  Apparently many <br/>
bards do not find a good fit.  I&#39;m not saying this to imply a <br/>
definite conclusion, but the data is relevant.  Personally, I enjoy <br/>
playing my bard very much, but do get frustrated in many situations.  <br/>
Especially in my current regular adventuring group, which has <br/>
warrior, cleric, enchanter, shaman, me, druid.  It is VERY difficult <br/>
for me to justify my participation in the group.  Especially in <br/>
places like Howling Stones, where the group would do MUCH better <br/>
replacing me with a rogue.  But these are my friends, and they enjoy <br/>
my company, and I theirs.  So I play mana song, and self buffs, and <br/>
hope I never have to use my CC, because that means that we&#39;re all <br/>
likely going to die.  I&#39;m not 53 yet, but in a few weeks when I am, I <br/>
suspect I&#39;ll feel a little more useful again.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, my point is, that the quantification of the power of a <br/>
class is very difficult.  And I feel it is quite bold of you to state <br/>
that we are overpowered.  Unfortunately for us, Verant seems to put <br/>
the weights in the same places you do.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; well it started out by someone saying dirge was useless due <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to recast time and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resists.  i said what resist problem, i never have any, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is useful in some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; situations including pvp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;never huh?  i will go with some nevers too.  i have never had this <br/>
land on<br/>
&gt; &gt;an uber mob.  i have never had this land on a character i am <br/>
dueling who is<br/>
&gt; &gt;equal or higher level than me and has any sense to put some MR <br/>
gear on.  and<br/>
&gt; &gt;i will never have this memmed if i am exp&#39;ing or raiding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; well never having a resist problem doesn&#39;t mean i have no resists, <br/>
just that the<br/>
&gt; resists are not excessive.  i don&#39;t know what you <br/>
consider &#39;&#39;ubermob&#39;&#39; being from<br/>
&gt; afterlife, but i was able to land this on innothule and maestro.  i <br/>
don&#39;t have the opportunity<br/>
&gt; to fight mobs much bigger than that at this time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i pointed out 2 good ways to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get quite a bit of damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out of this song (one of which was in an enchanter group, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; where many people think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they are useless).  the song has been compared to harm touch, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and i think it compares<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; favorably to harmtouch with respect to damage/refresh time.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;you call good damage 0.20 damage/second?  and that&#39;s being <br/>
conservative,<br/>
&gt; &gt;it&#39;s actually less.  you pointed out ways you can use the song, <br/>
they are not<br/>
&gt; &gt;good ways they are just ways you used to point out to people that <br/>
you do not<br/>
&gt; &gt;think it is useless.  harm touch doesn&#39;t take a spell slot, and <br/>
does a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt;more damage and is resisted far less with it&#39;s recent changes and <br/>
i think a<br/>
&gt; &gt;new SK discipline, and DDD is a waste of a song slot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; well, for those people who complain that they are useless when <br/>
grouped with an<br/>
&gt; enchanter, they should have plenty of open spell slots since they <br/>
can&#39;t figure out<br/>
&gt; anything else to sing.  harmtouch does a lot more damage on a per <br/>
second basis<br/>
&gt; than dirge?  harmtouch would have to do more than twice as much <br/>
damage as dirge <br/>
&gt; and you must only get a single target with dirge every time in <br/>
order for this to be true.<br/>
&gt; i pointed out 2 good ways to get more than 1 target on a regular <br/>
basis even when<br/>
&gt; grouped with an enchanter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i almost never solo.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;i am guessing you almost never go up against uber mobs in SoV or <br/>
even Kunark<br/>
&gt; &gt;either.  you would not think bards are overpowered.  i think we <br/>
kick ass in<br/>
&gt; &gt;an exp group, but i don&#39;t think that means we need to be extremely<br/>
&gt; &gt;unimportant on raids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; how many other classes are not extremely unimportant on raids?  <br/>
clerics, warriors,<br/>
&gt; rogues?  any others?  balance could mean overpowered in some <br/>
instances and<br/>
&gt; underpowered in others.  clerics for example are very good in <br/>
groups and uberraids<br/>
&gt; but aren&#39;t very good solo.  druids are very good solo, pretty good <br/>
in groups, and not<br/>
&gt; very useful on uberraids either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; like i have said many times prior.  the bard&#39;s biggest strength is <br/>
filling the gaps in a party.<br/>
&gt; on a large raids there aren&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) be gaps to fill so we <br/>
will be less effective.  except<br/>
&gt; for the few people in uber guilds who only go on raids, what is the <br/>
percentage of raids to<br/>
&gt; &#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39; hunting?  maybe 90/10?  so if we&#39;re overpowered in 90% <br/>
of the game and underpowered<br/>
&gt; in 10%, doesn&#39;t that work out to being overpowered as a class?<br/>
