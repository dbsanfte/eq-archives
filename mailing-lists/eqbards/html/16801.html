<div id="ygrps-yiv-528785828">Ya know.  When we were all level 7 and just starting out I remember HQ Pelts<br/>
going for oh... 3-4 pp.  There weren&#39;t 50&#39;s running around with excess cash<br/>
just falling out of their pockets back then.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t belittle him just because he sold his item for a price he liked.  I<br/>
fail to understand the mentality that so many players have that &quot;You&#39;re a<br/>
fool because you sold that item for XYZ coins!&quot;  It&#39;s his business and he<br/>
had his reasons.  Picking on him is just going to make him feel put upon and<br/>
put down on.  He chose to do it, it&#39;s over.  He knows he could have made<br/>
more money.<br/>
<br/>
Picking on him about it really is out of line.  Especially when I&#39;m sure<br/>
each of us, at one time or another, has made a stupid sale or trade.   I<br/>
still remember my bonehead self trading a Bloodstained Tunic for a EXEC hood<br/>
once.   Then I found out that the BS Tunic had gone up in price to almost<br/>
1000 pp (this was when rubicite was still in the game and a BS Tunic went<br/>
for 900-1200pp)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not too concerned if I couldn&#39;t have gotten more out of it.  For<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing, I&#39;ve never been offered more than 7 pp for those HQ bear skins.<br/>
For<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; another thing, FS weopons cost a lot more than I can afford from<br/>
vendors,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I had killed enough bears that I didn&#39;t mind trading one of the<br/>
skins<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; away.  I still have more.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   There&#39;s only one thing a HQ bear pelt is good for, and you&#39;ve got to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   understand that higher level players have at least a little money to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   throw around.  Don&#39;t feel bad if you are asking more than what you<br/>
&gt; &gt;   think the worth of something is, regardless of how easy it was to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   acquire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree with Harmonic.  The person who bought them from you<br/>
&gt; for 7pp was laughing all the way to the bank.  7pp is spare<br/>
&gt; change for anyone L35+.  Heck, I give 5pp for binds because<br/>
&gt; plat is so easy to come by.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I changed my bind point from North Freeport to West Freeport.<br/>
&gt; Now when I die, I run over to EC and kill bears while waiting<br/>
&gt; for a res.  Picked up a HQ bear pelt last night.  :)<br/>
