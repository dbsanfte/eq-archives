 </span></blockquote>You know, I was thinking all along that the Barb&#39;Dal on the cover art was<br/>
too empowered, you know? There she was, master of her destiny, wielding her<br/>
*own* Rod of Power,  clearly not in distress. Was the Erudite was eyeing her<br/>
thoughtfully, wondering what would he possibly have to offer this icon of<br/>
self empowerment? Or wondering why she wasn&#39;t looking to him for help, being<br/>
of course the natural order of things...<br/>
Well, I am glad to see that they have address this disturbing situation in<br/>
the new art, the Barb&#39;Dal is in chains, where she should be, subject to a<br/>
reptilian captor and clearly in need of rescue by some virile hero.<br/>
All is now right with the world.<br/>
