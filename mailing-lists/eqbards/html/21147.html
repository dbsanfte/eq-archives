<div id="ygrps-yiv-702800251">Well, getting imbrued armor is always a farm, since they took the pets out<br/>
of Hate. No raid I&#39;ve been on could be called a &quot;break&quot; since the first few<br/>
weeks the plane was live.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Fear goes, some people have never been, just got the levels<br/>
needed, have to work and such and miss out. What gets me is the people who<br/>
insist on putting them down for taking the opportunity to go when they can.<br/>
<br/>
So newbie_guild_00 has been planning their first fear raid for a month for<br/>
this Saturday at 10 am. And Uber_Ass_guild_01 has broken the plane the night<br/>
before. So the fear newbies catch the repop, cause it took alot of effort to<br/>
make their plane run happen and they know they might not have an opportunity<br/>
to go back again for a very long while. They don&#39;t have as much fun as you<br/>
did, they aren&#39;t as challenged as you are, but they&#39;re in a new place having<br/>
a new experience so it&#39;s still fun for them to a degree. But you insist on<br/>
putting them down and labeling them &quot;pharmers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As far as the distinction between the people who intentionally go to farm<br/>
repops - make a plan to go into the plane after it&#39;s done and intentionally<br/>
go to get loot with no risk - and the people I describe above, I don&#39;t see<br/>
how you can tell the difference. Unless you monitor every plane-able<br/>
character going in and out of fear constantly. In fact, I&#39;ve never met<br/>
anybody in-game who goes intentionally with this purpose. I think they are<br/>
more rare than you would like to believe.<br/>
<br/>
I remember back when fear was unbroken on my server. The Uber types who<br/>
constantly whine about farmers in fear today, were the very ones who ran<br/>
into the plane after the server went down - while it was completely empty<br/>
and safe - to explore, familiarize themselves with the plane, get their plan<br/>
ready, etc. I don&#39;t see much difference.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, other people&#39;s planar armor doesn&#39;t affect you at all. If it does,<br/>
it&#39;s a problem with your perception of your armor&#39;s value and meaning to<br/>
you, not a problem with the value and meaning of theirs.<br/>

&gt; Planar armor can be worn with pride, knowing you paid the price for<br/>
&gt; it many times over in blood.  People who can obtain this armor with<br/>
&gt; absolutely no effort, in effect, living off the hard work of others cheapens<br/>
&gt; the value of it. </span></blockquote></div>
