&gt;I am 34 right now.  Only have one chant.  I have charm kited fairly<br/>
&gt;successfully - mostly<br/>
&gt;Lake of Ill Omen, FM and Overthere.  But are you doing chanting, charming,<br/>
&gt;both?  And as you said, the zone can only support so many people.  If too<br/>
&gt;many, lag possibly gets you, right?  I almost died last time in the<br/>
&gt;Mountains due to lag.  I always enjoy the technical details of how this is<br/>
&gt;done.  Please indulge me one more time(and there are always young ones<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know you addressed this to Centiera, but I feel comfortable throwing in <br/>
my 2 cents since I&#39;ve been doing the same things. Also, I cut off Cent&#39;s <br/>
message as it was easier for me to answer your paragraph with one of my own.<br/>
<br/>
In Rathe Mtns if you get too many people, you can&#39;t charm kite. You require <br/>
at least 2 hill giants to charm kite efficiently. If the whole zone is full <br/>
of hill giants, a bard can spend all day with no downtime. The surviving <br/>
hill giant of each fight is killed by a new healthy hill giant that you <br/>
charm, you keep doing that and make lots of money and exp. But even on <br/>
Bertox, where there might only be 20 people in the zone, they&#39;re all doing <br/>
hill giants. There&#39;s also high level solo druids, necros and wizzies just <br/>
working for money.<br/>
<br/>
When I do hunt in Rathe Mtns, I will have my pet hill giant kill lizards, <br/>
cyclopses, giant skeletons, and even basilisks who are sitting on top of a <br/>
hill giant spawn point so that I will have plenty of hill giants spawn. I&#39;m <br/>
not exactly sure which mobs are the PH&#39;s for the giants, so I do them all.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I ever chant a hill giant (or spectre for that matter) is if <br/>
there are no other hill giants to charm. I just run big circles weaving my <br/>
2 chants and accelerando. Of course, the Nostrolo Tambourine is a huge help <br/>
if you are kiting with the chants and can be gotten with a little bit of <br/>
work for any level 35 bard, depending on the server you&#39;re on. For me, the <br/>
Kaesora coin was the hardest to get, but I just poked my head in there <br/>
every now and then and finally found someone to give me a coin. If I&#39;m <br/>
doing this type of &quot;begging&quot;, I make sure I&#39;m always extremely polite, only <br/>
send one zone wide request, and always apologize for bothering anyone who&#39;s <br/>
playing, &#39;cuz I know I refuse to help anyone who spams the zone repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, at level 39 I found that I can effectively kite in the Dreadlands, <br/>
even though I&#39;ve been told by a couple of bards (level 45 and level 60) <br/>
that it&#39;s probably too hard for me. Just had to try it. I was just going to <br/>
kite a Mtn Giant Craig near the Burning Woods zone with the chants, but I <br/>
aggro&#39;d a spider, running him over accidentally. Even though the Craig was <br/>
at half life, I charmed him and he dispatched the spider for me. Finished <br/>
my faithful pet off with chants. I didn&#39;t do anymore since I needed to camp <br/>
for the night, but I&#39;ll give it a go again soon.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in case you try, the giants in Frontier Mtns do not seem to remember <br/>
the last command you sent to them if you are having them kill each other. <br/>
You have to give your pet the command to attack again. Very annoying. Same <br/>
goes if you charm a giant skel in Rathe Mtns to kill another giant skel.<br/>
