<b>Subject:</b> Cazic Thule after the patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936264534">Last night I logged on at midnight PST and adventured in Cazic.  First thing<br/>
I did was a /who to see how many people were in the zone.  Not surprisingly,<br/>
there were only 16 people in there.  Most of these people were in their 20s<br/>
and low 30s.  Prior to the patch there would usually be 30+ people despite<br/>
it being late at night with several of them in their high 30s- low 40s.<br/>
Most likely explanation is that with no more rubicite the high levels didn&#39;t<br/>
have a reason to be there anymore.  This turned out to be pretty good<br/>
because the entire time I was there not one train was started.  <br/>
<br/>
There were also a lot of bards and rogues in Cazic as well.  Someone<br/>
confirmed that the Mudwater Rune is No Drop like most of the other bard<br/>
armor quest components.  I was told the lizard fanatic that drops it spawns<br/>
in the temple.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that didn&#39;t change though was killstealing.  A group with a couple<br/>
of rogues in it were camping one of the spawns that now drops rogue armor.<br/>
They had been there over 5 hours trying to get the armor.  While they were<br/>
waiting, a 48 magician came into the room.  Sure enough the spawn appeared<br/>
shortly and the 48 magician KS&#39;d it and got a piece of rogue armor.  To add<br/>
insult to injury, he immediately started auctioning it.  I guess even with<br/>
the new anti-KS patch, the magician was still able to do more damage than<br/>
the group.  <br/>
