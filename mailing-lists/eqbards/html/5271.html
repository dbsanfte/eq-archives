<b>Subject:</b> Recommendations for Spending my Bankroll <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-267489759">I&#39;m Level 21 with 2 bubbs - still hobnobbing around in banded.  I do have a Bronze Collar - but like the bonuses from my spliked...  I have 300 plats burning a hole in my bank vault.  I wield a Dragoon Dirk and a combine Longsword.<br/>
<br/>
    My basic assumption for spending that cash is to upgrade to Bronze - but do people think otherwise.  Also - what is a fair price for Bronze Armor.<br/>
<br/>
Much Thanks<br/>
