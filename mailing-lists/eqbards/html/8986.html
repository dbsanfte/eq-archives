<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246738844">My favorite personal example is from when I was young.  I was standing on<br/>
Reaver Hill in E Karana near the river watching some higher level folks pull<br/>
some gnolls so I could get some cool screenshots.  I was playing no song,<br/>
just standing there watching their ranger pull an undead reaver and 2<br/>
regular gnolls back to the group.  As they came over the rise I watched all<br/>
3 gnolls actually catch, and pass!, the ranger pulling them.  As I watched<br/>
confused lining up my screenshot the 3 gnolls ran right over the top of the<br/>
ranger&#39;s two mates, getting nuked as they came, and immediately proceeded to<br/>
beat on me!  I was at full health at the time, not playing anything, and not<br/>
even in the group with the puller.  Fortunately I made it to the zone with a<br/>
bubble of health left.<br/>

An example of bard hate, last night in Lower Guk our party is fighting a <br/>
frog shamen.  I am NOT engaged in melee, but sitting back and playing only <br/>
Clarity (aka Mana song).  The Shaman, not once, not twice, but THREE times <br/>
attempts to cast Tagar&#39;s Insects on me (melee speed debuff).  Very silly <br/>
AI:p  I have also had the same thing happen numerous times in High Hold <br/>
Pass.  Where I will stop to watch someone fight a Gnoll Shamen (in case they<br/>
<br/>
need help) and the Shamen turns and casts on me! I have never attacked it or<br/>
<br/>
assisted the person attacking it, go figure.<br/>

&gt;I have been hearing rumors that &quot;bard hate&quot; does not really exist... Anyone<br/>
<br/>
&gt;actually have proof that it does?<br/>
