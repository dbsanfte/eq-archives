&gt; &gt; Working as Intended is a valid response.  My problem is that with Verant it<br/>
&gt; &gt; has been the only response for bards. (Ok a generalization, but still true<br/>
&gt; &gt; on all important issues)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Working as Intended would be a valid responce if some explanation was<br/>
&gt;given that showed some actual thought had been put into that intent.<br/>
&gt;When used by Abashi, who&#39;s only responce to bards requests for<br/>
&gt;definitions of how the bard fit&#39;s into EQ is to say &quot;I think they are<br/>
&gt;just fine&quot; is insulting. His thinking that is merely an opinion, and<br/>
&gt;previously, he&#39;s admitted he just doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; bards, so it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt;admittedly uninformed opinion at best. Of the 5 or 6 L50+ bards that<br/>
&gt;were in our guild(s) (we have an alliance with another guild for doing<br/>
&gt;high level raids like (formerly planes and dragons) Trakanon, and<br/>
&gt;Veeshan&#39;s Peak), 3 are now playing other classes and one other has quit<br/>
&gt;the game. The fact that the concerns of the least played class in the<br/>
&gt;game at high levels are brushed off with this explanation is pretty sad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, someone who is using Mutt gets a bonus star in my book already. :-) <br/>
One of the dreaded unix guys who look down upon all windows users. (unless <br/>
Mutt was ported to Win that I&#39;m unaware of). When I&#39;m on unix I like mutt <br/>
vs pine or the other mail tools.<br/>

Have you noticed whether other 50+ people in your guild(s) also drop off? <br/>
Hearing whether it was out of Verant&#39;s responses that they decided to <br/>
switch classes would help back up your argument, as it seems to me that at <br/>
higher levels EQ is different from your standard gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Working as Intended&quot; is a hard stance. It sounds like they are happy with <br/>
the way that particular song works,  will ignore any further input about it <br/>
and just direct it to /dev/null. I don&#39;t know of any customer who would be <br/>
happy with this response to their complaint. It is a much more honest <br/>
answer than, &quot;We&#39;re looking into it.&quot; which is more off a brush off. Since <br/>
you guys didn&#39;t brush it off as well, they&#39;re taking the hard line, as <br/>
unpopular as it is.<br/>

&quot;You seem like a nice fellow. I&#39;d hate to die.&quot;</div>
