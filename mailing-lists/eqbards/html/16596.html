<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] New song idea <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-493227491">Yeah, that&#39;s something similar to an idea I&#39;ve been tossing around for a<br/>
while.  In The Realms, there is a spell that summon&#39;s the caster&#39;s group,<br/>
from anywhere in the game, to their location.  Personally, I think this<br/>
would be a great song for one of our still-unfilled slots.  Because it&#39;s not<br/>
a FULL  teleport spell/song (ie: your group members are brought to your<br/>
locale, but that&#39;s about it), it would definitely not overpower us as a<br/>
class while it could add all sorts of useful (possibly even fun) elements.<br/>
    Imagine you&#39;re deep down in Paw (or one of the Sols, or Guks, etc), and<br/>
someone needs to get more food/drink, or a member leaves your party and a<br/>
friend just logged on and wants to join... just send any tp&#39;r you may have<br/>
in the group, have them take care of said business, then call them back.<br/>
Too keep from gathering members that may be busy doing other things at the<br/>
moment, a lil box could pop up like when you get rez&#39;d.<br/>
     No imbalance of gameplay or classes, just something to make the gaming<br/>
experience a bit more fun.  Afterall, isn&#39;t that the point of any game?<br/>
    Lastly, it should have a little action message like whn the gms summon<br/>
you.  &quot;Barrd has been whisked away by chords of harmony.&quot;  or something like<br/>
that ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Just a though,<br/>

&gt;This song would be extremely useful in conjuction with<br/>
&gt;a binding group leader.  Imagine doing an Efreeti Raid<br/>
&gt;in SolB and wanting to bring in other members since<br/>
&gt;some need to leave.  Instead of breaking through again<br/>
&gt;the group leader would be bound at zoneline, group up<br/>
&gt;the bard and gate back to his bindpoint.  The group<br/>
&gt;leader would then group up the 4 new members and the<br/>
&gt;song would be sung and would teleport everyone back to<br/>
&gt;the bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are a few problems with this that may make it<br/>
&gt;too powerful.  Such as Plane of Sky (never been<br/>
&gt;myself) where this song could not be used to bypass<br/>
&gt;the teleporters etc...  Also this song may need to<br/>
&gt;remove the party members from all hate lists or risk<br/>
&gt;causing a hellish train through the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If it does remove everyone from hate list the song<br/>
&gt;becomes MUCH more powerful (too powerful?) in that in<br/>
&gt;Plane of Hate things go bad.  The bard runs up the<br/>
&gt;wall away from the fight and sings the song, everyone<br/>
&gt;teleports up the bard and is removed from hate list.<br/>
&gt;Therefore removing the need for clerics to camp out<br/>
&gt;etc...  This song combined with Selo&#39;s would make the<br/>
&gt;bard extremely wanted in any group, but especially<br/>
&gt;raids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The song may need to use up mana, although I really<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t want all our songs using up mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please let me know what you all think.  Its just an<br/>
&gt;idea I came up with when I should be working =)<br/>
