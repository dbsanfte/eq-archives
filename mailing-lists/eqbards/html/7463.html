<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158499788">Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is enough of a<br/>
penalty, thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
This is where the paradigm falls back to singlemindset games - that there<br/>
has to be a way to &#39;keep score&#39; - that puts the emphasis on advancement and<br/>
competition with others - instead of living in the world, and working with<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot &#39;win&#39; in a persistent world - nor should the goals be<br/>
artificially propped up to encourage that attitude.<br/>
<br/>
One of EQs major shortcomings - is there is a perceived &#39;end&#39;. Games - read<br/>
&#39;worlds&#39; of this nature are going to have to mature past the singleplayer<br/>
game mindset baggage they have towed along with them, for these worlds to<br/>
truly reach their full potential.<br/>

&gt;sure dying from an SG or griffin sucks,  but every time you are deliberately<br/>
&gt;fighting something, and things go bad, or its really close, or you pulled<br/>
&gt;too much, etc. etc. etc. and you get that excited/scared feeling in your<br/>
&gt;stomach, and your heart starts pounding...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;think you&#39;ll ever get that with no penalties for dying?  why would you?  no<br/>
&gt;dying penalties=no challenge=no fun.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;:Also, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying;<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; There does?  When and where did this ridiculous idea get <br/>
&gt;&gt; started?<br/>
