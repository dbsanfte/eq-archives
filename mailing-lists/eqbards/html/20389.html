<div id="ygrps-yiv-508453352">I&#39;m gonna have to agree to disagree on Sylly&#39;s side. :)<br/>
<br/>
Last night in Sebilis we had 2 groups.. including a Shaman and <br/>
Enchanter (2 at one point).  I didn&#39;t need to Haste, Slow, Snare (2 <br/>
druids), Heal (2 clerics, 2 druids, 1 shaman)... I could have sang <br/>
battle buffs to buff some str and dex and such, but there was only 1 <br/>
tank (Warrior) in my party... not a whole lot of mileage gained.  So, <br/>
I chanted (with selo&#39;s drum) and I charmed (a little) and I played <br/>
mana song and bind sight to help scout in the downtime.<br/>
<br/>
Was I being the most effective Bard I could be... imho, Yes.  And was <br/>
that helpful to the group?  Hell, yes.  Don&#39;t forget the magic, fire, <br/>
and cold resistances you&#39;re also lowering on top of the damage you&#39;re <br/>
doing.  That&#39;s helping every one of your nukers, procing weapons, <br/>
overzealous druids with their newfound starburst, etc.<br/>
<br/>
On a different tangent.. I hate telling people how to play their <br/>
class, but I&#39;m getting pretty annoyed at hearing the druid in the <br/>
party &quot;/g OOM&quot; before the wizard or mage does.  And this is WITH a <br/>
very good cleric in the party, so they&#39;re not blowing it on <br/>
heals. :)  Won&#39;t be grouping with that druid again... too bad he <br/>
walked off with 2 spell scrolls and a Sarnak Shield. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; if you want to do damage as a bard at high levels, as opposed<br/>
