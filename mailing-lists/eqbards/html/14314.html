<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448200899">I&#39;d love to hear the results!  But ooh the downtime!<br/>
<br/>
I was part of an all caster group of six that ventured into the new Paw.  We<br/>
had 2 enchanters, a shaman, a cleric, a mage, and a wizard.  It was boring<br/>
kinda.  We either annihilated the mobs we faced or got forced to gate real<br/>
quick.  With 3 pets we were able to get away every time though.  If we&#39;d<br/>
have had 2 necros and just 1 enchanter and no mage I think it would have<br/>
been even easier.<br/>

&gt; I ask you this.  If all the caster classes were suddenly removed from the<br/>
&gt; game would it still be playable at all?  I think not.  Removing all the<br/>
&gt; hybrid and melee classes on the other hand would make the game much<br/>
 </span></blockquote>harder,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and maybe make some mobs impossible, but otherwise the game would still be<br/>
&gt; playable.  To me that on fact is the ultimate statement of proof that the<br/>
&gt; classes are absolutely not balanced.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thats funny.  My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>
assertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>
Paladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>
types, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>
time thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>
levels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>
spread the damage around quite well.<br/>
