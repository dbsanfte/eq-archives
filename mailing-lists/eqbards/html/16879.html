<div id="ygrps-yiv-286787275">Hehe I told my guildmates that I flat out refused to help anyone twink a<br/>
bard.  There&#39;s too much to learn.  As on of my guildmates is learning (he<br/>
bought a retired 50 bard account).  He is so lost it&#39;s funny.  I told him<br/>
&quot;Go play a bard to 50, that&#39;s the only way to really learn&quot;.  I also pointed<br/>
him here so he can hopefully lurk and read some good advice.<br/>
<br/>
But I refuse to teach twinked bards how to be a bard.  As far as I&#39;m<br/>
concerned they can continue to be a lousy bard, or they can play the bard<br/>
the way it was meant to be played ;)<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t those bellow bards CUTE though? ;)<br/>

&gt; Ok, it&#39;s time for me to come out and voice that tribunal is THE bard<br/>
server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have yet to enter a zone with less than 4 bards. Doesn&#39;t matter what<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; it is or what zone I go to, everywhere I look I&#39;m surrounded by VERY green<br/>
&gt; bards in full blubicite.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This doesn&#39;t bother me in and of itself, other than the fact that I know<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; competing with tons of bards to get the nice drops I want so badly. (MM<br/>
&gt; drums, lambent quest components, etc) What does bother me is that a large<br/>
&gt; percentage of these bards are ultra twinked and don&#39;t know what they are<br/>
&gt; doing. I actually met a bard that didn&#39;t know how to twist songs at level<br/>
20<br/>
&gt; !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway seeing as how there are so many bards I often find myself grouped<br/>
&gt; with another bard and I start wondering about song selection. Many of the<br/>
&gt; bards I&#39;m with are still playing bellows in thier late 20s and early 30s.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; find this odd because I haven&#39;t memmed the song since level 23. I was<br/>
&gt; wondering when the rest of you removed bellows from the list of songs yu<br/>
&gt; regularly mem.<br/>

&gt; &gt; MM drums on tribunal are generally trade only (greedy caster bastards)<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; the one person who was willing to sell was asking 3k p. Naturally I<br/>
&gt; &gt; declined.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most drums on Prexus used to go from 1K to 1.5K.  It&#39;s used to be unusual<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; get over 2K for them.  On the other hand with all the bard twinks running<br/>
&gt; around these days, there are probably plenty of bards with 50th level<br/>
&gt; characters who wouldn&#39;t mind at all dropping 3K on some MM drums so they<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; run faster.  Heck, most of my best trades came from 50th level characters<br/>
&gt; twinking their other character :).<br/>
