<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240276739">Short answer: you CAN level faster at higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
Long:<br/>
Well, I know it seemed like I was 12th FOREVER, however you can easily<br/>
pick up a partner in Oasis for 13-19th or even higher, i know i went<br/>
from 14-15 in just a few hours in Oasis, with only a ranger as a<br/>
partner. At these levels, Tanks are your friends. They can dish out the<br/>
damage and you can heal them and restore stamina like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
My best XP experiences from 15th-30th were all with a group of several<br/>
tanks and ME (no caster, no pure healer). Just make sure the tanks<br/>
spread the damage around and your hymn is better than even a cleric.<br/>
Once you start to fight mobs that can whack a tank down to nothing fast<br/>
(read casting mobs, froggies, giants, etc.) a healer is a MUST, but just<br/>
fighting crocs in oasis or dervs being pulled well, your hymn is<br/>
awesome, and you can get by with just a ranger or paladin for heals.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I went from 27-30 in 3 days when the DW pets were running rampant<br/>
in Lake Rathe. a group of 3-4 tanks, with me singing hymn, Psalm of<br/>
Cooling and occasional Jig. Every time we added a caster, we killed<br/>
things SLOWER than without him.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player (maybe a couple<br/>
&gt; hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be taking longer...<br/>
&gt; Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it take longer for<br/>
&gt; each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each level, but<br/>
&gt; hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better selection of<br/>
&gt; mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or harder to level<br/>
&gt; in the early teens compared to later levels..  <br/>
&gt; Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?  I hate<br/>
&gt; camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I get bored and<br/>
&gt; leave....<br/>
