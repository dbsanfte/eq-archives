<div id="ygrps-yiv-794732647">Hasn&#39;t been that way on E&#39;ci in any of the events I&#39;ve seen.  Also it makes<br/>
events like the undead invasions totally pointless.  What challenges a level<br/>
40+ in those case, slaughters everyone who would normally be in one of those<br/>
zones.  Better to do that by having a horde of lower level mobs for the mid<br/>
range characters to battle, while having a half dozen or so gm controlled<br/>
mobs which concentrate on targeting the high levels who come to &quot;play&quot;<br/>

well to some extent, the rewards at these events are given to the folks that<br/>
tend to roleplay.  in parts of the lanys saga 2 of my guildmates were<br/>
rewarded<br/>
with items and they were level 30ish at the time.  and it wasn&#39;t cuz they<br/>
killed<br/>
the uberbaddie or whatever, it&#39;s cuz they roleplayed.  i believe the claw of<br/>
veeshan was also given to roleplayers rather than whatever level 50 happened<br/>
to show up and blast whatever npc happened to be there.  i believe (at least<br/>
for<br/>
the main storyline dynamic events) that the enjoyment of the event is in<br/>
participating<br/>
and roleplaying, not killing the npc&#39;s.</div>
