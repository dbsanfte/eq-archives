<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Bard Levitation (was: Patch Message) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-364175503">If I&#39;m so high above ground that I can see farther than the vid card renders<br/>
(heh), will mobs still aggro on me?  When travelling to Dalnirs, after<br/>
zoning into WW, I actually have to look down in order to see when I reach<br/>
the water...it just doesn&#39;t render far enough out to come into sight until<br/>
I&#39;m nearly under it, relatively speaking, of course.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been hit, when at high altitude (god, I love it, too...hehe), but<br/>
between aria (I think my level lev song isn&#39;t Aria, tho...??, I have to<br/>
twist..anyway) and selo&#39;s, I could have a mega train going, and never even<br/>
know it.(?)  :)<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m on the subject, anyone have tips on how to not lose group members?<br/>
Heh..course, it is pretty cool when you can &quot;bomb&quot; people<br/>
with...umm...people.  Heh...I dropped a halfling once...*splat*.  :)<br/>

Slyde ole brother of song.. the lad was making a jest. :)<br/>
<br/>
Actually the reason for the deaths had nothing to do with aria. It was part<br/>
of a series of &quot;fixes&quot; to prevent chain and over casting that broke bards.<br/>
All bard songs were effected Aria was the only one that got people killed.<br/>
No bard songs would refresh so you got one pulse had to stop the song and<br/>
then had to restart it.  Aria at the time had about 4 seconds of duration<br/>
beyond the pulse just enough to get you out of safty and into a long drop :)<br/>
<br/>
The next batch which fixed that problem then made it that weapons would not<br/>
proc while bard song was active.  That took them about a week or so to fix.<br/>
The lists go on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our Aria still will allow us to gain altitude and so does caster recasting.<br/>
However there is now a &quot;glass celling&quot; that dictates how high you can go in<br/>
a specific area.<br/>

&gt; The problem we old bards are talking about has nothing to do with Selos<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Arie of Eagles stacking.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; At one time non bards could cast their levitate spells before they ran<br/>
out;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; which made the levitate higher - so they could use multiple casts to<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &quot;Climb&quot;.  Verant nerfed it by requiring it to completely end before<br/>
<br/>
&gt; recasting.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; This broke our levitate song.  The second and subsequent pulse of AOE (and<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
&gt; assume Selo&#39;s Traveling - didn&#39;t have it then) wouldn&#39;t work until it ran<br/>
<br/>
&gt; out and you fell.  The unlucky bards who found this out the hard way - and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; used the song THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK often fell to their death.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; It was clear that Verant made a change to the spell system without doing<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ANY testing on the bard class.	Literally 19 seconds of testing<br/>
would have<br/>
<br/>
&gt; caught this bug.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums didn&#39;t add to the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; affect of Selo&#39;s. Again - many bards died expecting their songs to work<br/>
<br/>
&gt; they way they were designed (i.e. running away from mobs etc). In this<br/>
case<br/>
<br/>
&gt; - 3 seconds of testing would have caught it. They admitted it was a bug -<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but refused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They said it wasn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
&gt; critical enough (we were upset about this wondering the reaction from the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; player base is SOW was broken...)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a half-dozen or more<br/>
<br/>
&gt; bugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending to affect Bards<br/>
<br/>
&gt; that were introduced into the live servers because the most trivial level<br/>
<br/>
&gt; of testing the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Heck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by players and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; reported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>

&gt; Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a nessesary nerf because<br/>
<br/>
&gt; bards would outrun guides and make fun of them. Now the will plummet to<br/>
<br/>
&gt; their death in many areas<br/>
