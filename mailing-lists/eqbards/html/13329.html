<div id="ygrps-yiv-743741570">Well, today they announced there were new quests implemented for all the<br/>
49th level hybrids.  Once again we join the &quot;not a&quot; camp as further<br/>
questioning by EQCaster&#39;s Baelish revealed that meant new quests for<br/>
Shadowknights, Rangers, and Paladins only.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon&#39;s post on Bards being primary targets was similarly insulting.  When<br/>
was the last time your Shaman failed to be able to buff the entire group<br/>
before a fight, without ever getting on a mob&#39;s hate list?<br/>
<br/>
I had an almost fruitful nite last nite.  I joined a pretty good group,<br/>
however they insisted on one thing.  They wanted me to sing only one song.<br/>
They didn&#39;t care what it was, but said they wouldn&#39;t be able to protect me<br/>
from all the attention I would get if I was &quot;weaving&quot; and didn&#39;t want to see<br/>
me die needlessly.  I found that in fact not restarting any songs did push<br/>
me way down on the target of choice list.  Of course I felt like I was<br/>
forced to fight with one hand tied behind my back all night to avoid getting<br/>
ganged up on, but at least I got xp.  We tried having me &quot;weave&quot; for one<br/>
fight, and while the effect was superior, I was target player very quickly<br/>
and the warrior 4 levels higher than me was unable to taunt the mobs off me.<br/>
Fortunately we all survived.<br/>
