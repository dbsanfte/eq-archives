<br/>
I was a Senior Guide for 11 months<br/>
I dealt with, in that time, roughly 500 people who lost anywhere from 1 item<br/>
to an entire corpse to various corpse loss/item loss bugs.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s 1 server<br/>
out of what?  26?<br/>

&gt; &gt;they may be incredibly rare, but what if it happened to you?  i bet you<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;have it so far down on the priority list then.  what is the higher<br/>
&gt; priority, something<br/>
&gt; &gt;people have already learned to work around or something which<br/>
&gt; can wipe out<br/>
&gt; &gt;hundreds of hours of playtime on a character?<br/>
&gt; &gt;you know well over 100 players, eh?  out of the 200000<br/>
&gt; subscribers.  yeah,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;an appropriate sample size to determine that poofed corpses are<br/>
&gt; just not a<br/>
&gt; problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it happened to me?  Either they&#39;d fix it or I&#39;d be done with<br/>
&gt; EQ.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what customer service is about.  No it still wouldn&#39;t be a higher<br/>
&gt; priority.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was only counting the people I know in RL personally.  I doubt anyone<br/>
&gt; knows an appropriate sample size in that way.  From seeing the boards<br/>
&gt; though, there are hundreds of posts on bard song bugs, very few on having<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s own corpse poof.<br/>
