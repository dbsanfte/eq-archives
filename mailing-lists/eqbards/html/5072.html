<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;9.  Why not make a Perform Skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is the bard-only version of begging... if you perform well enough,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NPCs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;will give you money.  I have had great success with roleplaying this for<br/>
&gt;PCs, but it seems to me that a young bard should be able to sit on a street<br/>
&gt;corner and make a few silvers by strumming his lute... level caps can keep<br/>
&gt;this balanced, and perhaps this skill could work in conjunction with the<br/>
&gt;Carillion?  OK, this is just another random idea, not important to the<br/>
&gt;class, but it sounds  right now = )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the best Idea Ive heard in a while, I had this thought awhile back<br/>
but couldnt really think of how to implement it......<br/>
<br/>
I Love it.<br/>
