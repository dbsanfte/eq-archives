Yes, I will definitely be at work on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  As a<br/>
matter of fact I&#39;ll work most of the day on Thanksgiving too.  I&#39;m one of<br/>
the owners and the firmware programmer for a small oil and gas related<br/>
electronics firm.  We get calls from all over the world every day.<br/>
Thanksgiving doesn&#39;t have any significance to the national oil company of<br/>
Norway, Statoil, nor does it have much significance to our brothers to the<br/>
north in Canada for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a fun idea, but Saturday at noon would work better for me<br/>
personally.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Noon on a Friday?  What college student is organizing this<br/>
&gt; shindig anyhow?<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t want to sound *too* much like the decrepid cog in the<br/>
&gt; workforce that<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am, but some of us might have to work and stuff.<br/>
