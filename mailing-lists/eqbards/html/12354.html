<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325581336">Pray that the fallout from your raid is nothing like the one on Prexus.  The<br/>
good feelings from the raids (Vox, Nagefen and Fear all went down in a<br/>
period of 3 days) quickly turned into animosity, arguments, cries of<br/>
elitism, and just plain bad mojo.  The raids seem to have touched off a<br/>
firestorm of debate about who gets to go, who gets what loot, etc...  It&#39;s<br/>
just plain bad mojo and I know a lot of players who have quite Prexus<br/>
because of it.  Just check out the message boards on www.prexus.com in<br/>
regards to the dragon raids and the plane raids.  My guild is medium sized<br/>
(40 or so) and well respected, but we only have one level 50 and almost<br/>
everyone else is in the low 30&#39; which means we don&#39;t have any<br/>
representatives in the current raids.  Since I&#39;m getting closer to<br/>
participating in this stuff, I&#39;m wondering if it might not make sense to<br/>
start over on another server...  On the other hand, there are a lot of<br/>
really great 30 something people on Prexus both in my guild and in other<br/>
guilds with who we have great relations (also all 30 something guilds) and<br/>
I&#39;m really really hoping the landscape changes by the time I get to 45+...<br/>

&gt; I got to hear a lot of it thru guildsay - like listening to the &#39;big game&#39;<br/>
&gt; on the radio.  There was a tremendous allied effort that went into that<br/>
&gt; raid.<br/>
