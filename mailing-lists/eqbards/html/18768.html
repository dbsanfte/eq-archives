&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find it kind of disheartening to see all this attitude about GZ&#39;s answer<br/>
&gt; to the question Baelish asked him.   GZ didn&#39;t design the armor, the<br/>
&gt; equipment team did.  He asked them, they answered.  He didn&#39;t comment on<br/>
&gt; whether he agreed to it or not he just relayed their answer.<br/>
&gt; Jesus... don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; shoot the messenger guys.  GZ has always tried to at least answer us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, my thoughts, my oppinions are below.  They differ from others but<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s ok, we&#39;re all different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1)  Bards are not primary tanks.  Yes it would be _nice_ to have<br/>
&gt; 3 or 4 more<br/>
&gt; AC but I&#39;m not going to stay up at night over it.<br/>
&gt; 2)  Bards have ways of reducing their taunt level now (Song of dawn,<br/>
&gt; harmonic weapons)<br/>
&gt; 3)  **************   GZ Doesn&#39;t design armor.  That&#39;s a different team<br/>
&gt; ******************<br/>
&gt; 4)  The singing steel BOOTS are AC 18.  It&#39;s not like their AC<br/>
&gt; Sucks they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; still better than anything else we could get before, including imbrued.<br/>
&gt; 5)  The &quot;Magic&quot; number for AC is about 800 AC.  After 800 there<br/>
&gt; seems to be<br/>
&gt; a dramatic drop in the amount that you get hit.  With buffs it&#39;s even<br/>
&gt; better.  Right now a level 50 warrior can get their AC to about 800 maybe<br/>
&gt; 900 with items.  We can get ours to about the same.  With singing steel I<br/>
&gt; will be able to get my AC (at 50th level) to over 900.  (Warriors may be<br/>
&gt; able to break 1000 with theirs)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why must we have the same ac as a warrior?  We can kite, they<br/>
&gt; cant.  We can<br/>
&gt; Charm, they can&#39;t, we can reduce our taunt, they can&#39;t, we can run faster<br/>
&gt; than anything in the game, they cant.  We can heal, they can&#39;t,<br/>
&gt; we can DoT,<br/>
&gt; they can&#39;t.  Umm I&#39;m gonna stop before that paragraph gets too long ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not saying it wouldn&#39;t be nice to have more AC.  I&#39;m saying I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; having a cow about a *slightly* lower AC.  Now, people complain<br/>
&gt; that rangers<br/>
&gt; have higher ac than us.  I PLAY a Ranger.  They need AC about 10<br/>
&gt; times more<br/>
&gt; than we do.  I play a Ranger and a Bard and a Warrior.  Bard is<br/>
&gt; my primary.<br/>
&gt; My warrior does ok.  My Ranger takes more dmg in any given fight than my<br/>
&gt; bard does, hands down.  They NEED that AC, they&#39;re a tank!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Am I envious?  Sure!  Am I going to die if I don&#39;t get an extra 4 or 5<br/>
&gt; points of AC added onto my armor?  Nah.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now... the effects on the armor REALLY ticks me off.  So far every effect<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve put on there are rarely needed, two of which (greaves and<br/>
&gt; boots) we<br/>
&gt; have covered with forage anyway.  What I kind of wish is that<br/>
&gt; they&#39;d give us<br/>
&gt; effects that we don&#39;t have songs for.... hmm ok maybe just give us effects<br/>
&gt; that we have songs we never use for ;)   (FYI I can&#39;t think of an effect<br/>
&gt; that we can&#39;t duplicate with our songs ;)  Invis Undead would be nice for<br/>
&gt; the boots though... god I&#39;m tired of begging for one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway... The armor is STILL Better than anything we could get<br/>
&gt; _previously_<br/>
&gt; The only reason people are upset is because other classes are getting<br/>
&gt; _better_ ac on theirs.  Uhh  so what?  I&#39;m a bard.  I&#39;m proud to be a<br/>
&gt; bard...  And anything over 800AC is just bonus to me.  800 is the &#39;magic&#39;<br/>
&gt; number.  Ask any warrior.  The next really dramatic number is 900 and then<br/>
&gt; 1000.<br/>
