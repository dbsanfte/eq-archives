&gt;So basically you need to land this on 4 targets with no resists to outdamage<br/>
&gt;the Shadowknight.<br/>

outdamage, i misspoke.<br/>

&gt;break 3 mezzes, he&#39;s gonna be mighty pissed at you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>so you can&#39;t shoot this off before he mezzes things?  have the puller targetted<br/>
and start the song off as soon as the puller gets in range.  i would guess that<br/>
your song will go off 100% of the time before the enchanter would get a mez<br/>
off in that situation.<br/>
