<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053877805">They (guides & GMs) are currently empowered to take action and fix these<br/>
exact abuses.  But its very hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is<br/>
lying.  And they have not got well established precedents and experience.<br/>
They also don&#39;t have a lot of support from Verant who pretty much has given<br/>
them broad guidelines.  They (guides & gms) hear lots and lots of lies,<br/>
storys, b.s. and wierd stuff.  Sometimes (many times) they will say &quot;nothing<br/>
I can do...&quot; but I know for a fact that they can do things - including<br/>
character restores, item impounding, account banning (temp & perma.)<br/>
<br/>
I fell through the world in Upper Guk and asked for a exp res.  &quot;Sorry,<br/>
nothing I can do...&quot;  Happened to a friend and he got a res.  Same crack in<br/>
the world, different guides.  And I have seen several other problems where<br/>
people have gotten char restores. One guild member had a partial corpse<br/>
after a zone crash on a dragon raid.  Her corpse was there but her stuff was<br/>
gone.  GM said, OK we can reload you from a previous time save but anything<br/>
you looted or exp gained since them will be lost.  &lt;poof&gt; She was restored.<br/>
They can do it.  I have seen it.  Getting them to do it is another matter<br/>
entirely.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s what I meant - eventually, we&#39;re going to need<br/>
&gt; human-operated laws and enforcement in these things.  Step 1<br/>
&gt; would be empowering the GMs to actually do things based on the<br/>
