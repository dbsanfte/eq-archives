<div id="ygrps-yiv-479845822">I&#39;ll add to this.  I have never found the &quot;truely hidden&quot; factor to be<br/>
dependent on the level of the mob, when I hid they all seem to turn<br/>
indifferent.  But what I have found to work is this.  Target something in<br/>
the zone that cons anything EXCEPT indifferent.  Then hit the hide button.<br/>
If you are successfull the con on the mob will turn to indifferent.<br/>

&gt;&gt; 3)  What does it mean to have a lower/higher Hide skill level?  It<br/>
&gt;&gt; *appears* to work perfectly each time.  I hit the button, I disappear.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Does skill level determine the length of time that it works?  Or whether<br/>
&gt;&gt; the MOBs can see you anyway?  Or anything else at all?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think your skill level just determines your chance of<br/>
&gt;success.  Whether or not you&#39;re really hidden seem to depend<br/>
&gt;on the level of the mob and a random factor.  I&#39;ve succeeded<br/>
&gt;at hiding, had a green mob turn indifferent while a blue one<br/>
&gt;was still amiable.  I then hid again and both were<br/>
&gt;indifferent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You will always disappear from your POV while using this<br/>
&gt;skill, whether it succeeds or fails. </span></blockquote></div>
