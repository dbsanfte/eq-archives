<div id="ygrps-yiv-638988698">tried nagafen since patch?  his breath is now outrageously powerful, or FR<br/>
doesn&#39;t do crap anymore.  vox is still the same though.  but with the same<br/>
crew we routinely take down nag with, we got spanked twice (24 ppl).  it was<br/>
late and people had to leave, so next day a different group of 48+ took him<br/>
down.  i think we could do it with 30, but he is definitely upgraded or FR<br/>
is bugged.<br/>
