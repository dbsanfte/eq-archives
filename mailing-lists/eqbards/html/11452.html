&gt; &gt;We&#39;re Bards, right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Waitaminute, I thought we were necromancers...<br/>
&gt; hehehe oops do I feel like a <br/>
&gt; ninny.  No wonder those bone chips never worked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;So.... who&#39;s up to a little composition?  Sing a<br/>
&gt; little here... sing a <br/>
&gt; &gt;little there.... sing to the news guys.. sing to<br/>
&gt; the news groups...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, here&#39;s something I threw together last night:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s Hard to be a Bard<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s hard to be a bard, although I have to<br/>
&gt; say,<br/>
&gt; I love it though it hurts to know it&#39;s changing<br/>
&gt; every day<br/>
&gt; In ways I think the gods must blink in puzzlement to<br/>
&gt; see -<br/>
&gt; The many ways these changing days have been the<br/>
&gt; death of me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had a song, though not for long, a joy for me<br/>
&gt; to play<br/>
&gt; It let me fly across the sky, but then, the other<br/>
&gt; day<br/>
&gt; My levitate began to wait before it would relight<br/>
&gt; And so I fell and died, oh well... a casualty of<br/>
&gt; Flight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a greed for superspeed, I simply hate to wait<br/>
&gt; To break a root, there&#39;s no dispute, Accelerando&#39;s<br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; And then one day, to my dismay, ghoul-rooted and in<br/>
&gt; need,<br/>
&gt; My precious tune did nothing boon... a casualty of<br/>
&gt; Speed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve one refrain, a sonic chain - it slows the<br/>
&gt; target down<br/>
&gt; Reducing flight, and in a fight, it&#39;s justly won<br/>
&gt; renown.<br/>
&gt; A fleeing whelp returned with help; one change my<br/>
&gt; fate explains -<br/>
&gt; Since he had SoW, I could not slow... a casualty of<br/>
&gt; Chains.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very sad to say I had the horrid luck to see<br/>
&gt; Upon the plain, through fog and rain, The Thing That<br/>
&gt; Must Not Be.<br/>
&gt; To show their ire, the gods rained fire, and both of<br/>
&gt; us were charred...<br/>
&gt; Apparently the gods could see the Thing but not the<br/>
&gt; bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s hard to be a bard, although I have to<br/>
&gt; say,<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sure there are some other stanzas I should<br/>
&gt; include, but can&#39;t think of <br/>
&gt; what other unintended/undocumented nerfs have hit us<br/>
&gt; lately.  Any <br/>
&gt; suggestions?<br/>
