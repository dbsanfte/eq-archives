<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133930666"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; mention it is simply a faction song.  it absolutely has a difference with a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I did not produce the same results.<br/>
<br/>
  This weekend I tested CCC on three things with and without a flute:<br/>
<br/>
  In Halas, Rogue Guild (dubious to me) went to apprehensive with or<br/>
  without the flute.<br/>
<br/>
  In DE form a merchant in North Ro was dubious and he went to <br/>
  apprehensive with or without the flute.<br/>
<br/>
  In Rathe Mountains, the Ogre merchants are dubious to me, all <br/>
  went apprehensive with or without the flute.<br/>
<br/>
  In fact, anything I&#39;ve ever tried with my flute has never gone<br/>
  from dubious to anything but apprehensive.  I am willing to buy<br/>
  the fact that CCC adjusts faction by X amount, and if you are too<br/>
  dubious to some faction it will only bump you up to apprehensive.<br/>
  If you are only slightly dubious, it could put you to indifferent<br/>
  or even low amiable.<br/>
<br/>
  But to say players can go from dubious to amiable with a flute is not<br/>
  always a true statement.  Nor does the flute always show a faction<br/>
  difference, if the adjustment is minor and your faction is in the <br/>
  lowest range of the category.<br/>
<br/>
  So, I admit the flute may boost the amount of faction given, however<br/>
  faction levels are not static 1 or 2 faction level jumps I&#39;m guessing.<br/>
  The song appears to give +numeric faction, and not +category faction.<br/>
  This is important in understanding the effects of the song.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
