<div id="ygrps-yiv-435580581">hehehe ok i like this topic... here is one for you all.  in butcherblock<br/>
killing dwarven citizens (it&#39;s cheesy but easy, hey that rhymes) i met a<br/>
level 40 druid.  he asked me to help him split up 2 dwarves who were<br/>
together.  it seemed strange being a druid and all, so i just said use<br/>
harmony.  he said: &quot;i&#39;m gonna go buy it.&quot;<br/>

&gt; He&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; only cleric I know who though Befallen was way too tough a <br/>
&gt; dungeon.  Of<br/>
&gt; course since he was using his generic DD&#39;s instead of his <br/>
&gt; undead specific<br/>
&gt; ones (which he hadn&#39;t bought yet) I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised.<br/>
