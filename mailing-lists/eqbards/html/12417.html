<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892689853">I was grouped with a Druid that I had only grouped with say three or four<br/>
times before.  I was saying &quot;blah, blah need to go to the gypsy camp and<br/>
sell blah blah, it&#39;ll only take a minute at bard speed&quot; and he said &quot;Wanna<br/>
Race?&quot;  To totally set the hook I said something like &quot;I&#39;m a lot faster than<br/>
SoW you know&quot;  Well anyhow he fired off Cheetah, I started my song and we<br/>
took off across North Karanas.  At level 41 with a percussion of 200 and<br/>
Mistmoore Drums I totally blew his doors off.  He was *stunned*.  He went on<br/>
and on about how amazed he was that we ran that fast ALL THE TIME when his<br/>
spell only lasted 15 seconds.<br/>

&gt; At level 34 I raced my brother&#39;s druid with Spirit of Cheetah across East<br/>
&gt; Commons.  While his spell lasted, he was slightly faster... Of<br/>
&gt; course I have<br/>
&gt; selo with MM drums all the time and he gets 15 seconds of<br/>
&gt; Cheetah.  Haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tried the same race at 35.  How often does the song get an upgrade?<br/>
