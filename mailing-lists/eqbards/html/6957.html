&gt; a) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>

&gt; intentional or a bug?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had no problems using Pixie Strike against my friend in the<br/>
Arena a month ago.  I did not test Lullaby.  Charm does not<br/>
work well in arenas, but I hear that is because there is no<br/>
pathing in there, so your &quot;pet&quot; has no way to follow you or a<br/>
target.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I say get rid of the hit-a-song-key-to-stop-it function<br/>
entirely.  The &quot;you have not yet recovered&quot; delay is<br/>
client-side and thus completely dependent on how quickly your<br/>
CPU is able to cycle the button graphics from greyed out to<br/>
colored in.  If you get in a laggy battle (e.g. lots of area<br/>
effect spells), you will find the buttons taking longer to<br/>
come back.  I can even change this delay by switching between<br/>
DirectX and glide mode (it&#39;s faster under DirectX on my<br/>
Voodoo3, which is one of the reasons I almost always play in<br/>
DirectX mode despite some other graphics glitches).<br/>
<br/>
Unlike spells (which often stay greyed out a while after<br/>
casting), our songs come back immediately after you stop them<br/>
(aside from the time it takes to color the button in).  So get<br/>
rid of this &quot;delay&quot; and when we hit a song button, have it<br/>
auto-stop any previous song and start up the next one.  This<br/>
will also have the benefit of cutting the arcade nature of<br/>
playing a bard in half.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let us left-click on SoW to remove it.<br/>
<br/>
Change our levitate song so that it does not override the<br/>
levitate spell (same problem as SoW used to have).  Same thing<br/>
with underwater breathing.<br/>
<br/>
Make the identify song party-effect, so folks without an<br/>
innate identify ability can identify no-drop items.<br/>
<br/>
Fix the bug where a charmed pet will on its own decide to<br/>
attack a player.<br/>
<br/>
Let us gain safe fall skill at something like 1 point/level<br/>
(thus capping us at around 65 for level 50, instead of a hard<br/>
cap of 40).  I&#39;m finding myself taking damage again running<br/>
over uneven terrain with my mistmoore drum at level 35.<br/>
<br/>
Our dodge skill caps at 125.  A cleric&#39;s dodge skill caps at<br/>
80.  I understand not giving us parry and riposte since we&#39;re<br/>
not true tanks, but capping dodge at 125 makes us little<br/>
better than clerics at tanking.  Surely a class whose primary<br/>
means of attacking is melee would know a lot more about<br/>
defensive melee than a cleric?<br/>
<br/>
Either make our invisibility song make us completely invisible<br/>
(no glowing ball), or make the glowing ball for this song last<br/>
longer so that we can take advantage of it to coordinate party<br/>
movement while invisible (what GZ suggested we do last time).  <br/>
Right now, the only practical way I&#39;ve found to use this song<br/>
with a group is for me to walk and everyone to /follow me - we<br/>
don&#39;t need a glowing ball to do this.<br/>
<br/>
Investigate whether the &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;<br/>
change made our invisibility song 100% reliable.  As much as I<br/>
like 100% reliable invisibility, that can&#39;t have been what<br/>
Verant intended.<br/>
<br/>
Fix Hymn so regeneration can be cast on top of it.  Right now,<br/>
regen will not take unless you cast it before you start Hymn.<br/>
This has caused a lot of folks I group with to waste a lot of<br/>
mana trying to figure out why their spell won&#39;t take hold.<br/>
<br/>
State whether or not Anthem/Clerity&#39;s attack speedups stack<br/>
with the enchanters&#39; spells.  I haven&#39;t found them to stack in<br/>
my tests, but some official word would go a long way towards<br/>
clearing up misconceptions (and saving me a lot of testing :-)<br/>
and letting us optimize our song selection.<br/>
<br/>
Change spell behavior so that if it isn&#39;t resisted, its<br/>
effects last for at least one &quot;tick.&quot;  None of this BS where a<br/>
mob doesn&#39;t resist Lullaby and nods asleep, but immediately<br/>
wakes up to bash me.  I&#39;m pretty sure casters experience the<br/>
same problem with root.<br/>
