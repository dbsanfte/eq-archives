&gt; weapon?  Are you utilizing your strength bonuses more by carrying the Higher<br/>
&gt; Damage weapon and hitting for more raw power, or by hitting more often for<br/>
&gt; slightly more power?  And same with lower strength.... Does anyone have data<br/>
&gt; or an idea of a calculation to determine this?  The answer is vaguely in<br/>
&gt; front of my eyes, and I can not quite grasp it.  : )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just making this up as I go along, but I believe that STR has<br/>
an effect on the chance of hitting for maximum damage.  I am quite<br/>
sure that STR does not affect what that maximum damage is (at lower<br/>
levels ie. &lt; 13, anyway), as I frequently compare notes with friends.<br/>
<br/>
My friend with a 2H dwarven axe was quite amused to find that she<br/>
occasionally hit for 1 damage!  Is that like a shaving nick?  8)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if the curve is linear, logarithmic, exponential, normal,<br/>
limited exponential or any other variant you can think of.  But<br/>
logic (!?) says to me that it is affected by STR and your Offence and<br/>
skill rating at that weapon.<br/>
I understand that DEX affects the chance of hitting, but it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
surprise me to find that it also affects the above.<br/>
And of course, just to make this difficult, it all is affected by<br/>
what you are attacking.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, trying to untangle how STR alone affects your combat would<br/>
be quite a time consuming task.  Not impossible though.<br/>
<br/>
So, if anybody is interested in spending the time necessary: we need<br/>
a bard to sing Chant and Anthem, and somebody with maxed out skills<br/>
to attack the same type of creature over and over, taking note of<br/>
hits (and how much) and misses.  Do this LOTS (would 1000 attack<br/>
rounds be a reasonable sample?), while keeping all else constant.<br/>
Note the weapon you were using, your skill levels etc, and then repeat<br/>
with the bard NOT singing Chant and Anthem.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you will have to make sure not to level-up in the middle<br/>
of this procedure.  And the bard&#39;s singing/drumming would also have<br/>
to be maxed out (not hard).<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you want to be really complete, do this again with a different<br/>
weapon.  And again.  And again.   8)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if lots did it just once each, we could get an idea.  And then<br/>
again, maybe nobody cares that much, and we can go on speculating<br/>
about it!<br/>
