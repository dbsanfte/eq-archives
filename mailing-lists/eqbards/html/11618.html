<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674476399">Some good testing here. This may be the perfect time to get this looked<br/>
into, in light of their obvious sensitivity to the recent Alchemy<br/>
debacle. I&#39;d suggest cc&#39;ing the email to Brad as well as GZ and ask that<br/>
they look into the testing methods they are using to confirm that it<br/>
actually works as intended.<br/>

&gt; That might make sense, except that from the data it was apparent with<br/>
&gt; Lullaby that either the Mez (your right better term) lasted the full<br/>
&gt; duration, or it lasted for 0 duration.  It never lasted for 3 seconds as<br/>
&gt; would be the case if they were getting a chance to break out every round.<br/>
&gt; Since these mobs all had Speed Factors of 30 it was really easy to see.  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; lullaby, mobs would nod.  Some nodded mobs would attack immediately,<br/>
&gt; sometimes in the middle of propagating the nods messages.  No mobs that did<br/>
&gt; not attack immediately would attack thruout that entire pulse.  The nodded<br/>
&gt; mobs that attacked the first time would attack again.  The nod messages<br/>
&gt; would propagate again followed by attacks from some of the nodded mobs<br/>
&gt; immediately thereafter.  Often different nodded mobs, no apparent pattern of<br/>
&gt; once it sticks you are good, mobs that didn&#39;t false nod for 10 pulses would<br/>
&gt; often false nod for 2 in a row thereafter.<br/>
