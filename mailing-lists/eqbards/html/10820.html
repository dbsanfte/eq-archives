<div id="ygrps-yiv-658678160"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Well like Harmonic posted already you have the benefit of being on a mature<br/>
&gt;servers.  At 20th level on a non-mature server I had a combine rapier and a<br/>
&gt;combine dagger as my main weapons.  Barbed Whips were around, but were <br/>
&gt;trade<br/>
&gt;only and very rare.  FYI at 39th I just got a Runed Falchion this weekend <br/>
&gt;:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At the risk of sounding like my grandparents, &quot;we had to walk to school up <br/>
hill in kneedeep snow both ways!&quot;. I remember back a few weeks after the <br/>
game went commercial, my druid and her ranger buddy spent 2 weeks in Paw and <br/>
at the undead camp in WK, trying to get enough cash together to buy him 2 <br/>
combine scimitars, his first magic weapons.  He now has an assortment of <br/>
weapons (EB, silvery axe, morin, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Theres something to be said for playing on a server that hasnt matured yet.  <br/>
You dont see much twinking for one thing.. and everyone is pretty much in <br/>
the same boat you are.<br/>
<br/>
On topic:  finally got my Pixie Strike last night! Woohoo! I&#39;m beginning to <br/>
feel like a real bard ;-P<br/>
