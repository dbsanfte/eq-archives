<div id="ygrps-yiv-661205334">Forgive me venturing a bit to far into the trade talk, but just for the sake<br/>
of random bard knowledge to share with my friends here on the list, I got<br/>
ahold of the vodka recipe a couple days ago and tried it out (brewing skill<br/>
is only at about 20 now) and failed due insufficient skill in 9 attempts.<br/>
The funny thing and the point of the message is that each time I failed, the<br/>
product of combining the items necessary was an empty shot glass which is<br/>
not one of the original components of the recipe.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I have discovered a new skill.<br/>

&gt; &gt;With that said, everyone knows that not everything in EQ is <br/>
&gt; logical.  Case<br/>
&gt; &gt;in point is the vodka recipe that is the current hot topic <br/>
&gt; on the brewers<br/>
&gt; &gt;list.  People have been trying for weeks to discover this <br/>
&gt; recipe.  All kinds<br/>
&gt; &gt;of logical ingredient combinations were tried.  This week <br/>
&gt; the recipe was<br/>
&gt; &gt;discovered/leaked by Verant.  One of the ingredients for <br/>
&gt; vodka is short<br/>
&gt; &gt;beer.  No way in hell would anyone ever think to include <br/>
&gt; beer as part of a<br/>
&gt; &gt;recipe for vodka.  I&#39;m sure there are other examples out there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Um.... *cough* (from a vodka-distillation page)<br/>
&gt; &quot;The scale of operation is one where 10 kg of sugar per batch <br/>
&gt; are fermented<br/>
&gt; to a crude &quot;beer&quot;<br/>
&gt; which is then distilled to yield 11 liters of 40% vodka.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a feeling that&#39;s where the idea came from...<br/>
