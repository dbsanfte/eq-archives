&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was level 41 last night (42 now) and me and a ranger friend, Deerwen,<br/>
&gt; (level 45) fought a bunch of spectres last night.<br/>
&gt; Since we were near Oasis we checked out the Spectres and found them<br/>
&gt; uncamped. He was concerned about how to break the camp. I told him not to<br/>
&gt; worry about it. He waited by the inn near the sro zone and after I got a<br/>
&gt; sow from him, sang my aria and ran out to the island in the middle of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lake.<br/>

&gt; I tried to Lament the spectre closest to the edge that runs down towards<br/>
&gt; the water. Resisted. Ack! Here he comes with 4 of his friends. Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This ranger should be chastised for having you pull. In that situation he<br/>
should be up there with Harmony pulling. Lament, like the calm series runs<br/>
into this problem, harmony doesn&#39;t although it&#39;s limited to outdoors zones.<br/>
I&#39;m always amazed at the difference a good bard can make, but at least in<br/>
this case the ranger had the edge.<br/>
