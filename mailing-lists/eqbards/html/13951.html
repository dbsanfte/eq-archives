&gt; Sea furies are just cyclops with a new name. At first they dropped the same<br/>

low 30s.  Unless they&#39;ve been nerfed lately, the seafuries<br/>
could eat me alive even at 40.  My friends and I fought them<br/>
for about 2 hours at 40-45 (4 tanks, cleric, and bard) and<br/>
they took so long to kill we decided it wasn&#39;t worth the<br/>
experience.<br/>

accurate or concise enough for me to consider them reliable.  <br/>
(That&#39;s not to say you don&#39;t contribute - you provide insight<br/>
from the L50 viewpoint.  But you&#39;re like a fishing buddy I<br/>
have.  He knows a lot about fishing technique and style, but I<br/>
don&#39;t believe anything he says with numbers in it.  He&#39;s just<br/>
not a numbers kind of guy.)<br/>
