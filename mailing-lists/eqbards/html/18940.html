<br/>
I&#39;m in a cooperative and team-spirited guild.  And you&#39;re right, the boots<br/>
are very easy to get.  They&#39;re not that rare and drop in the entry areas of<br/>
Karnors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However the Singing Steel gauntlets drop deep in Karnors.  Unfortunately<br/>
Karnor&#39;s is a wasteland due to the faction hits associated with it now.<br/>
Getting a group in there is difficult.  On top of that most guilds are<br/>
relatively scattered right now.  Even my guild, with over 50 members, has a<br/>
tendancy to be shotgunned all over the place :)<br/>
<br/>
The Greaves drop off a named npc which is, from last I heard, now<br/>
un-killable since they took out a feature that allowed you to neutralize his<br/>
AE attack.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone is going to just get their guild to do these items.  From what<br/>
I was told by one of the clerics in our guild the area of Karnor&#39;s where the<br/>
Gauntlets drop is around level 54 in difficulty and even then was murderous<br/>
for them.  Unfortunately only 1 set of gloves dropped and a person from<br/>
another guild got them.  We don&#39;t have a large number of 53+ members yet.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t just assume that all of us have the resources to just &quot;Go get&quot; these<br/>
items.  They aren&#39;t dropping like candy and are relatively rare.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Geez you guys...  Try and get into a cooperative, team-spirited guild.  I<br/>
&gt; logged on last night and had two different guildmates send me tells saying<br/>
&gt; they had some Singing Steel boots for me if I still needed them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Last night a 51 Wizard from my guild mentioned that he had a friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; (non-Bard) selling singing armor.  I asked him what the guy wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt; per piece and he said 8K.  I think this is absolutetly outragoes.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; mentioned to my wiz that I heard on this list some people mentioned<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5k-6k and others even 1.5-2.  He said he thought prices were higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; on Xegony than other servers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard outrageous demands (5 - 8k) for Singing Steel as well.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just wish them luck in selling it and try not to LMAO to them<br/>
&gt; &gt; directly. :)  I was lucky to receive boots from a guildmember as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; gift (I feel so twinked! :) but I would not pay 5k for either gaunts<br/>
&gt; &gt; or boots.  There aren&#39;t THAT many Bards out there to keep the price<br/>
&gt; &gt; that high, even if some are naive enough to pay it.  I&#39;d pay 1.5 -<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2k, maybe as high as 2.5k if I go long enough without (or I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; planning a trip to Kedge).  Otherwise, I&#39;ll wait until I can get them<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself, or am able to loot some Imbrued.  (I finally have a large<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough buffer in 47 to tempt me to Hate next trip I am invited on :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, I sold my Lambent Boots for 400 pp.  I would think 5 X that<br/>
&gt; &gt; price is reasonable for the Singing.<br/>
