<b>Subject:</b> Gypsy Lute <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-11628143">Someone posted a query a day or two ago asking for advice on camping the<br/>
Mistmoore Gypsy Room for the Gypsy Lute.  My guild is planning a Mistmoore<br/>
Raid Saturday to help me get the Lute (and the Battle Drums would be great -<br/>
and Gypsy Princess Lute would be okay as well!)<br/>
<br/>
    Any advice from people who have successfully camped the room would be<br/>
appreciated.  I&#39;ve never been inside the castle.  So how do you get in - and<br/>
where should we camp?  In that room - or another and pull from that room.  I<br/>
have looked at the maps - but not sure of strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
