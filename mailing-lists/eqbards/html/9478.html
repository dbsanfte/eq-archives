&gt; On another somber note.  The highest level incarnation of Dragoon Zytl now<br/>

bite the dust now.  I don&#39;t even bother looting them anymore.  <br/>
They&#39;ve caused me more trouble than Dorn and Dvinn combined.  <br/>
These two are so overpowered for their /con that I feel its a<br/>
duty to rid the zone of them if but for a short time.<br/>
