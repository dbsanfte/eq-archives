<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] More than 6 in a group? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-698480010">I didn&#39;t particularly want to sneak an extra person into the group, but its<br/>
very annoying having 7 people show up for a guild event.  It would have been<br/>
nice to include them.  No doubt this is now at the top of Verant&#39;s list of<br/>
fixes and fixing actual things in the game that damage its enjoyability by<br/>
the customers will be pushed back yet again.  All in the name of integrity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How can a game where a necro&#39;s pet can outdamage each and every one of the<br/>
other 5 people in a fight when the necro is lowest level character present,<br/>
have any integrity to begin with.  Bah!<br/>

I didn&#39;t catch the message last night. I never thought of it as an exploit.<br/>
Now I do.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;d be a shame to lose everything I&#39;ve worked for over the past seven<br/>
months just to sneak an extra person into the group.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely not worth it.</div>
