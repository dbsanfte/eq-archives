<div id="ygrps-yiv-697317830">Banded goes, on every server I&#39;ve played on, for between 6 and 7 pp a piece.<br/>
Cheaper if you know the smith.  I&#39;ve seen them go as high as 10pp but that<br/>
is pretty rare, even on the young servers.<br/>
<br/>
Low price would be between 4 and 6pp.  (yes, I&#39;ve found it that cheap).<br/>
<br/>
Remember:  When doing trade skills your WISDOM keys your success rate.  Low<br/>
Wis will HURT you.  My rogue has a 109 int and an 83 wis (base, she&#39;s an<br/>
inkie) so she rarely fails ;)  I&#39;d say, at 17 tailoring skill, she fails<br/>
about 1 in 4 tries.<br/>

&gt; Nah, my bard is a tailor.  By the time patchwork became trivial I was only<br/>
&gt; failing half the time, making it about a break even skill.  Made more<br/>
money<br/>
&gt; fishing, which she still does since she&#39;s always forage fishing grubs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My rogue, also level 10, is just starting her tailoring skill.  Doubt<br/>
she&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; have any more luck money wise, but I hope to at least complete the set<br/>
she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; wearing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps it&#39;s a server by server thing.  How much do people want per piece<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; banded on your server?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hehe, my rogue on Tallon Zek (who I just made 2 nights ago)<br/>
&gt; &gt; is level 6,<br/>
&gt; &gt; completely un-twinked.  Has full leather armor, a Giant Snake<br/>
&gt; &gt; Fang and is<br/>
&gt; &gt; starting to buy her banded already.  What you&#39;re doing wrong<br/>
&gt; &gt; is not using<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade skills ;)  Some of them are profitable even for NPC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; ;)  I can make<br/>
&gt; &gt; almost 5 platinum an hour with my rogue ;)  (at level 6<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s not bad at<br/>
&gt; &gt; all ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Trade skills ;)  Specifically:  Tailoring ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So you&#39;re level 10, untwinked, and wearing BANDED???  What<br/>
&gt; &gt; am I doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; wrong?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Good job helping that other bard out.  He must have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; twinked to get to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level 10 playing only one song.  Weaving&#39;s all that&#39;s kept<br/>
&gt; &gt; me alive many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; times over.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obvious he was twinked.  Here was this level 10 wood elf<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard, dressed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head to toe in bronze.  I gave him the gauntlets, and he very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graciously<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gave me his old bronze gauntlets. :)  They look nice on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Adagia, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think they are too heavy, I&#39;ll probably just stick to<br/>
&gt; &gt; banded for now.<br/>
