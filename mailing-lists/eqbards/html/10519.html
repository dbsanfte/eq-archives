 </span></blockquote>  No, cancel magic is said not to cancel fear or charm.<br/>
  (Although I have not tested it, relaying info I heard)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The least number of people in the Castle the better.  There is<br/>
  definitely a trick to pulling things solo in there.  Especially<br/>
  in the Maid and Butler room.  More people creates more confusion.<br/>
<br/>
  My only options were to run or fight.  And if I did run, these <br/>
  things would/could have happened:<br/>
<br/>
  1) I run, Sog (now an npc with unlimited mana and range) nukes<br/>
     me dead anyway.<br/>
<br/>
  2) I run, Davassi forces Sog to follow me, and then he breaks<br/>
     charm in the middle of 10 deathly dingdongs.<br/>
<br/>
  3) I run, and myself get jumped by 10 deathly bitches.<br/>
<br/>
  4) I leave the room, and writhe in the grip of agony about<br/>
     20 times.<br/>
 <br/>
  5) I fight, and possiblely attract more attention from roamers.<br/>
<br/>
  6) I fight Sog, and still get nuked cause level 50 NPCs always<br/>
     regain concentration.<br/>
<br/>
  7) I fight Sog, pixie strike him, 44 vs 50 (get resisted)<br/>
<br/>
  8) I Desperate Dirge Davassi, killing her and myself and<br/>
     maybe Sog too.<br/>
<br/>
  ... in a matter of seconds all that ran through my mind,<br/>
  Starfire casting time is 6.2 seconds I believe.  I had <br/>
  approximately 12.4 seconds to figure out my plans.  I <br/>
  think I made the best choice.  I pulled a &#39;fearplane&#39;.<br/>
  Get a loc, curl into a ball, and kiss your ass goodbye.<br/>
