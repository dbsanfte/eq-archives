		I&#39;m not sure what to do, maybe someone has some advice for<br/>
me. While sitting <br/>
		calmly on the deck of the boat on my way to Faydwer, I<br/>
suddenly found myself <br/>
		sitting on a rock in the middle of OOT surrounded by Sirens<br/>
and Aqua-goblins <br/>
		with the boat nowhere in sight. I have been stuck there for<br/>
2 days now. I <br/>
		petitioned immediately of course, but there were no GM&#39;s on<br/>
then. I have <br/>
		logged back in morning, afternoon, and evening but only once<br/>
saw a GM log <br/>
		on. They were on less than 5 minutes and logged off again<br/>
without answering <br/>
		my petition. I&#39;ve tried to catch the boat in passing, but<br/>
don&#39;t stand a <br/>
		chance of catching it. I don&#39;t want to abandon my bard, my<br/>
guild has <br/>
		invested too much into helping me catch up with them in<br/>
levels.<br/>
