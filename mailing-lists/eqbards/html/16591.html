<div id="ygrps-yiv-997918250"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   Ok besides Taneran, who likes to play with Gnolls, I think the undead<br/>
&gt;   component should be added to our existing invis, and let a brand new<br/>
&gt;   song be introduced in our lineup.  Force Verant to actually do some<br/>
&gt;   work and give us a song we can actually use all the time (instead<br/>
&gt;   of one that works in Lguk and Kith, heh)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in total agreement that it would be great for this to be part of the<br/>
original invisi song, but I&#39;m also a realist who think that given Verant&#39;s<br/>
past crimes it will never happen.  On the other hand, the &quot;invisi to undead&quot;<br/>
version of this song would be perfect for the level 39 slot if not just a<br/>
tad late.  While you may no longer find a need for it, I really think that<br/>
this song would be a definative &quot;bard-defining&quot; song for bards around level<br/>
39.  Imagine the power of the bard doing corpse recovery with their invisi<br/>
song running into the Lords room and pulling all of the dead bodies to<br/>
zone...  And yes, maybe it is only two zones today, but what makes you think<br/>
that any of Verant&#39;s new dungeons are going to not be undead dungeons?<br/>
<br/>
I would definatley not advocate putting an invisi to undead song higher then<br/>
the missing level 39, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t revolt or complain if it<br/>
suddenly showed up at a vendor as a new level 39 song...<br/>
<br/>
45?  I think it should be an upgraded charm... Always have, always will.<br/>
<br/>
Above 50?  I&#39;m still shifting around ideas.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve already got all the other dungeons except Sol B covered, and no one<br/>
can do anything with invisi there...<br/>
<br/>
BTW, is there something wrong with playing with gnolls?  Gotta love all that<br/>
barking!<br/>
