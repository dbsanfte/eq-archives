<div id="ygrps-yiv-479984561">Being mostly elf, I don&#39;t juggle numbers too well.<br/>
<br/>
I went to look at the song analysis on Rokken&#39;s page.  I did some of the<br/>
calcualtions and did not even have to take my bear skin boots off.<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is...<br/>
<br/>
DDD, for example, calculates to 33 dmg for my level (48 still) and I presume<br/>
that this means 33 for 3 &#39;ticks&#39; (correct me if that is wrong: DoT lasts 3<br/>
ticks).  Now is that a potential max damage number in that you can get<br/>
partial resists?  Or does that mean if the song sticks (not resisted on the<br/>
first tick) it will do 33 * 3 for a total of 99?  Or is there a possibility<br/>
of partial resists?<br/>
