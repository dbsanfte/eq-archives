<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156320173">Because they reduced the profit margin<br/>
dramatically in the last patch, I&#39;ve heard.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t tried pottery since the patch, I<br/>
only used that money to re-equip after<br/>
losing everthing to a bug.  It used to be<br/>
even more lucrative than brewing, I made<br/>
30pp an hour doing pottery.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d expect the margins on that to reduce<br/>
dramatically though.  This game is not<br/>
about running from vendor to wheel to<br/>
kiln to vendor to rack up money.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, if I hadn&#39;t lost everything, and<br/>
been denied a leg up kit, I&#39;d never have<br/>
done it.  There is a sense of accomplishment<br/>
in EQ that comes from earning your gear.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a common thing in single player games<br/>
for people to get cheat programs, make<br/>
themselves unbeatable, and tire very quickly<br/>
of the game.  Verant wants people to keep<br/>
striving for a significant length of time, as<br/>
they depend on subscription monies to<br/>
continue the incremental development process.<br/>
<br/>
Pottery, and to a lesser extent, Brewing<br/>
created money in the EQ economy.  Looting<br/>
mobs does as well, but not as consistently<br/>
(at least not at the levels where these trade<br/>
skills do) as pottery and brewing.<br/>
<br/>
What V wants from trade skills is players<br/>
creating goods for players, not players<br/>
creating goods for NPC&#39;s.  Unfortunately,<br/>
only smithing and, to a lesser extent, jewelcraft<br/>
after the tweaks, act in this manner.  Worse,<br/>
the changes people most want to smithing,<br/>
the ability to smith higher grade armors and<br/>
magic weapons (with the help of an enchanter)<br/>
are useless on an established server.  There is<br/>
no window of opportunity to sell these items due<br/>
to the glut of magic weapons and armor on the<br/>
market at the level you&#39;d expect these player<br/>
made items to occupy.<br/>
<br/>
Two things are necessary (IMHO) to make a<br/>
player based economy work.<br/>
<br/>
1.  A money drain.  At high levels platinum apparently<br/>
becomes useless.<br/>
<br/>
There needs to be NPC provided services and goods<br/>
that high level players WANT and that cost a significant<br/>
amount of platinum.<br/>
<br/>
2.  A method to take magic weapons out of circulation<br/>
and keep them out of the hands of characters of lower<br/>
levels than they were intended for.<br/>
<br/>
I think that, if you put in the ability to make magic weapons<br/>
tomorrow, smiths and enchanters would find very<br/>
little market, as the items would have to compete against<br/>
magic weapons like the Dragoon Dirk, RTS and others<br/>
that provide bonuses to stats, good performance and the<br/>
ability to hit magic creatures, all at prices that players<br/>
in their low teens can afford, simply from hunting.  (I bought<br/>
my first magic weapon, a tentacle whip, at level 9, for 15pp.<br/>
Granted, I only had 20pp to my name, but I regained the<br/>
majority of the outlay in a 1 hr session that saw me pick up<br/>
a lightstone and two greater lightstones)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the off-topic rant, I guess I&#39;m just tired of<br/>
people over on the pottery list whining about V nerfing<br/>
trade skills.  We were never meant to make steady<br/>
plats selling created goods to vendors.  Clicking a mouse<br/>
for hours on end, with no player interaction, no exploring,<br/>
and no risk are not in Verant&#39;s vision for the game.<br/>

&gt;why do you say that?, I found the brewing I did pretty profitable,  but I<br/>
&gt;had to give my eyes, and wrist a break after a solid half hour.<br/>
