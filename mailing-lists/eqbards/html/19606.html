<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948284230">Unrest was really good for me from 26 thru 31.  Rest of the group was same<br/>
or 1 level higher.  Bard, Ench or Necro, SK, War, Clr, Druid.  Around 25 we<br/>
did the Bar room (2nd floor), then 27 or so (which was 2 or 3 nights later)<br/>
we moved to the Knight room (3rd floor.)  In our low 30&#39;s we did the<br/>
basement torture chamber.  Around mid 30, we did the Ghost room with a<br/>
higher level druid who wolfed us.  Then we moved on.<br/>
<br/>
Iirc, I would use the Lullaby song for crowd control in the Bar and Knight<br/>
room when we needed it. Our ench was trading off between her Ench and her<br/>
Necro.  In the house, you can attack things on the 3rd floor from the second<br/>
floor.  You see the particle effects from 3rd floor fights all the time when<br/>
in the bar room.  And you can target and attack thru the floor.  Also, the<br/>
agro ranges over-lap.  Our rule of thumb for either room was both needed to<br/>
be camped to hold the one you were in. So, we paid attention to the &#39;other<br/>
room&#39; and were prepared to evac if they left or were chased out.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Mistmoore and unrest?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Having recently hit lvl 29, I left the Lake and FM<br/>
&gt; zones for Mistmoore...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; dying six times in two days and a lvl lower, my party,<br/>
&gt; in the same boat, has voted to hit Unrest, thinking we<br/>
&gt; might have better luck there.  (any suggestions on<br/>
&gt; hunting in Mistmoore? ... the alcove and graveyard<br/>
&gt; proved disasterous for my party lvls 22-29)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Questions:  If I am singing DDD on the second floor of<br/>
&gt; the House in Unrest, will I be pulling mobs on other<br/>
&gt; floors?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What part of Unrest is good for a mid/high 20s group?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
