<div id="ygrps-yiv-976004922">With Selos, I have only attracted the attention of one of the spiders once.<br/>
Even then it only lightly tapped me with a couple spells before I was out of<br/>
range.  I have to admit that is scared me silly until I zoned but I only<br/>
lost about 1/2 bubble of health before I got away from it.  I was of course<br/>
heading toward the Lake of Ill Omen which looks like it is easier to get to<br/>
than the Swamp of No hope.<br/>

On a second note:  That was a great song Reed!  I thought it was great<br/>

Do you really have problems with them?  I have never even had one look<br/>
at twice at me, they don;t seem to be very aggressive...  Especially<br/>
with Selo&#39;s I never thought of them as a threat...<br/>
