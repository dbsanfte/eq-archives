&gt; I have noticed something that could very well be a bug. My wife (druid) <br/>

&gt; targetted on. I push my &quot;/assist &lt;char_name&gt;&quot; button and interestingly, <br/>
&gt; find that I&#39;m targetted upon a different frog. (Of course &lt;char_name&gt; is <br/>
&gt; filled in with her character&#39;s name)<br/>
&gt; It has wreaked a little havoc having our necro Dot&#39;ing the wrong frog. It <br/>
&gt; happens intermittantly to us during pulls. I&#39;ve asked my wife to keep her <br/>
&gt; autoattack on even when returning to the camp to see if that helps, but it <br/>
&gt; has made no difference. Sometimes we have the right frog, sometimes not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is a bug. With warriors, I was under the impression it could happen<br/>
because of parry and riposte, haven&#39;t played with druids and such<br/>
pulling for a long, long time. I have the assist key hard coded to the<br/>
main assist&#39;s name like you and usually hit it 5 or 6 times before<br/>
trusting I&#39;ve gotten the correct assist. In very tough fights where<br/>
breaking a mez could cause a lot of problems I&#39;ll even wait for the hp<br/>
bar to drop a bit before casting any dot (speaking as a druid here) This<br/>
is also why I have switched to a paw of oppalo for guild raids. Even in<br/>
combat mode I can&#39;t actually hit anything with a paw so it reduces the<br/>
chance of breaking a mez.<br/>
