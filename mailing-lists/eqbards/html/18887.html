<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-243954146">Thanks for the guk help, I want to be a part of getting the stuff (even<br/>
if its merely looting it off other people&#39;s kills).  They just want me<br/>
to get my few lambent peices (that I can afford the gems for right now)<br/>
and get back to leveling in Kunark...  <br/>
<br/>
Our druid has already gotten the greaves peice from Permafrost (they<br/>
were camping something for our enchanter ans got the peice by accident),<br/>
so does the trick of having two people hand in the peices in succession<br/>
still work at the temple or RO?  IE can he hand in the icy greaves<br/>
(whatever they are killed) then I hand in the shin greaves and gem(s)?<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
