<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444073105">In order to stop players from exploiting by creating pathing problems for<br/>
mobs (safe zoning or making them stick to terrain) - now if a mob has a<br/>
pathing problem - he is teleported to you. <br/>
<br/>
If you could kill them (avo) on the ground and you had lamented the roosting<br/>
birds, why not just fight the avo on the deck (not in the room) or drag him<br/>
to the first skinny catwalk going down?  20-20 hindsight.<br/>
<br/>
Or yell to zone and higher lev will come take the avo away and solo him or<br/>
pull to a ground crew.<br/>

		Was fighting in the aviak roost in SK last night.  Had the<br/>
22d level<br/>
		teleport song memmed so I could get down to the ground fast<br/>
without having<br/>
		to use the ramp.  I was in a party of three people.  The top<br/>
roost was full<br/>
		of spawns.   Three aviaks on the inside and an avocet on the<br/>
outside.  If<br/>
		you attack an aviak on the outside, sometimes the ones on<br/>
the inside will<br/>
		join in.  Told my party I had a neat bard trick to show<br/>
them.  I lamented<br/>
		the three aviaks on the inside, started singing the teleport<br/>
song, and<br/>
		attacked the avocet before I teleported.  I was teleported<br/>
to the base of<br/>
		the ramp.  Before I had time to equip my weapons, the avocet<br/>
appeared right<br/>
		in front of me and started to whoop my butt.</div>
