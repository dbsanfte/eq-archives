&gt; I don&#39;t recall seeing a post from you on that subject.  Can you repost it<br/>
&gt; please?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted it in a while.  Basically, it&#39;s a<br/>
way to end camping.  Every named mob is always spawned, but<br/>
you can only kill/loot it once in your character&#39;s lifetime.  <br/>
Item rarity is then determined by the frequency of the item<br/>
appearing on that mob.  As it is now, item rarity is<br/>
determined by the the number of players willing to camp the<br/>
mob for umpteen hours to get the item.  That would get the<br/>
special items more evenly distributed among the playerbase,<br/>
rather than having them concentrated in the hands of those<br/>
with prodigious amounts of otherwise fruitless camping time.<br/>
It&#39;d also stop farming and eBay selling cold.<br/>
<br/>
There are some other changes minor needed to make it work<br/>
properly.<br/>
