I never have used Psalm of Cooling all that often. My personal preference <br/>
would have been to sing Celerity, chains and clarity. Celerity because of <br/>
the monk, chains because of snare/slow, and clarity to make the cleric happier.<br/>
<br/>
With a cleric, monk and bard, I&#39;m not sure the magic resistance debuff is <br/>
really worth the effort. Then again, if the cleric is chain stunning, it <br/>
may have some merit.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Karnor&#39;s last night twisting Berserker Crescendo, Chains (we had <br/>
nobody snaring) and clarity at the Drolvarg Capt&#39;s camp. I&#39;m only 45 and <br/>
this was my first time really fighting in Karnor&#39;s. My friend said it was <br/>
extremely rare that a 45 would get invited to this and that I&#39;d normally <br/>
get laughed at, but I&#39;d rather be naive and in a group, than wise and <br/>
sitting around.<br/>
<br/>
Group consisted of 2 paladins, cleric, necro, magician and me. I&#39;m really <br/>
glad we were able to handle multiples without crowd control, as at my <br/>
level, I couldn&#39;t pixie strike anything. I was able to charm a drolvarg <br/>
when we were waiting at the zone, but that was the only time I ever needed it.<br/>
<br/>
We rolled along just fine at the Capt&#39;s camp and even had him spawn a <br/>
couple of times (mantle and cobalt gauntlets dropped) as well as a <br/>
deathbringer&#39;s rod from a berserker. I only won 1 roll and that was for a <br/>
Kunzar cloak, rolled a 100 out of 100 (where was that roll for the <br/>
deathbringer&#39;s rod?). A couple of near deaths from multiples, but <br/>
otherwise, pretty steady.<br/>
<br/>
However, when one of the pally&#39;s left, a very bossy shaman (level 56 or so) <br/>
joined the group. She ordered me to stop singing Crescendo as it was <br/>
blocking her haste, and constantly called for &quot;manasong&quot; (why can&#39;t they <br/>
just ask for Clarity?). She asked the necro to snare, and of course, she <br/>
didn&#39;t give me a speed buff. Since she was also slowing down the mob&#39;s atk <br/>
speed, there was no reason for me to sing chains. I have no idea if the <br/>
berserker crescendo blocks her speed buffs, but since there was only 1 <br/>
other tank, probably wasn&#39;t a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I switched to singing Jonathan&#39;s provocation for myself, and 2 pulses of <br/>
clarity. Was a nicer speed buff for myself. When I got low on stamina (Yak <br/>
and Kisch) I&#39;d switch over to Cantana (sic) and 2 pulses of clarity.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be open to other singing suggestions since I shot through level&#39;s 43 <br/>
and 44 real fast (thank you bloodgills) and haven&#39;t had much time to test <br/>
various songs in a group.<br/>

&gt;Chains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>

&gt;Fufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also reduces the mob&#39;s MR<br/>

&gt;Psalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk and the damage<br/>
&gt;shield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>

&gt;Heh with my cleric (who normally plays only in his regular group, but with<br/>
&gt;my play I have missed several sessions and need to catch up), I was gfrouped<br/>
&gt;with a monk and a bard in L Guk (&quot;How long could it take for us to tfind a<br/>
&gt;tank, lets get the ass sup camp while we wait&quot;).  The bard was singing the<br/>
&gt;oddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no snarer or slower),<br/>
&gt;Curtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh????  I suggested<br/>
&gt;singing celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>
&gt;anything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.  Oddly she was<br/>
&gt;quite competent at crowd control.  With Pixie she was keeping 2 mobs at bay<br/>
&gt;with no trouble...<br/>
