<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610358716">Yeah, it used to be that way, right after release.<br/>
<br/>
When I was about, oh...5th level, that would have been within about 3 weeks<br/>
of release, I was grouped with a cleric friend.  We came across a +pvp guy,<br/>
who had almost lost a fight with a spider or snake or something, and was<br/>
begging for help, cause he was poisoned and about to go unconscious.  So,<br/>
the kindly cleric whipped out a small heal, and poof, she was red.  Oh, man,<br/>
I was upset.  Cause that meant if I turned on a song, I might go red too.<br/>
The +PVP guy was upset as well.  All three of us petitioned, and lo and<br/>
behold, I saw my first GM.  Was a druid I guess, cause he popped up as a<br/>
wolf, and we all freaked, knowing we were gonna die, witha  named wolf right<br/>
there.  He changed back to human form, and calmed us down.  He explained the<br/>
situation to us, and was quite upset that it was not common knowledge about<br/>
the +PVP thing.  He ended up changing the cleric back, after some argument<br/>
with the other two GM&#39;s who showed up.  As far as I know, the next patch,<br/>
they changed it, so that helping a +PVP did NOT make you +PVP.  The GM&#39;s<br/>
were also going on about how many cases of this they had to handle in the<br/>
days preceding this, so I think that Verant decided that this was<br/>
overloading them, and changed it.  So yes, it used to be that way, but as<br/>
far as I know, it was changed about week 3 or 4 of release.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;As for turning PvP that&#39;s a bunch of nonsense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I believe, looong ago, that was going to be the original mechanism. Least I<br/>
&gt;remember reading about it when first looking in to EQ. If you aided a +PvP<br/>
&gt;character you went +PvP. I think they probably decided that was going to be<br/>
&gt;a MESS and changed it.<br/>
