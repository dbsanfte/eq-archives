&gt;In any case, had to chime in here.  JS, your point about being <br/>
&gt;overpowered and underpowered in different aspects of the game is well <br/>
&gt;taken.  However, this is the difficulty in determining what &quot;balance&quot; <br/>
&gt;really means.  The weights you place on the various aspects in <br/>
&gt;forming an overall balance picture are no more and no less completely <br/>
&gt;arbitrary than anyone elses.  Everyone has their favorite aspect they <br/>
&gt;want to be good at, and if bards aren&#39;t meeting the grade in that <br/>
&gt;particular aspect, at that particular time, then people get upset and <br/>
&gt;think they&#39;re underpowered.  It&#39;s as simple as that.  Stating that <br/>
&gt;bards are overpowered &quot;in general&quot; assumes that you have the perfect <br/>
&gt;set of weights to apply to each aspect that a bard is either good, or <br/>
&gt;not good at to arrive at an overall value.  This basically boils down <br/>
&gt;to opinion, and your opinion seems to be in the minority amongst most <br/>
&gt;bards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sure, i agree that this is my opinion.  what i am doing is explaining why<br/>
it is my opinion with concrete reasons, whereas a lot of people on the other<br/>
side just parrot that we are underpowered, we need this, we need that, and<br/>
never put forth a coherent reason as to why.  only the verant designers know<br/>
what weights they want to put on various phases and methods of playing the<br/>
game when they are deciding class balance.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For each individual player, it comes to finding out what aspects of <br/>
&gt;the game bards are good at, and what they are not good at, and <br/>
&gt;applying that to their respective playing styles.  If they like the <br/>
&gt;fit, then they happily keep playing their bards.  If they don&#39;t, they <br/>
&gt;either play a different class, or the complain a lot, and keep <br/>
&gt;playing their bard.  Given the relatively small number of bards, and <br/>
&gt;the number of bards stop playing at a given level.  Apparently many <br/>
&gt;bards do not find a good fit.  I&#39;m not saying this to imply a <br/>
&gt;definite conclusion, but the data is relevant.  Personally, I enjoy <br/>
&gt;playing my bard very much, but do get frustrated in many situations.  <br/>
&gt;Especially in my current regular adventuring group, which has <br/>
&gt;warrior, cleric, enchanter, shaman, me, druid.  It is VERY difficult <br/>
&gt;for me to justify my participation in the group.  Especially in <br/>
&gt;places like Howling Stones, where the group would do MUCH better <br/>
&gt;replacing me with a rogue.  But these are my friends, and they enjoy <br/>
&gt;my company, and I theirs.  So I play mana song, and self buffs, and <br/>
&gt;hope I never have to use my CC, because that means that we&#39;re all <br/>
&gt;likely going to die.  I&#39;m not 53 yet, but in a few weeks when I am, I <br/>
&gt;suspect I&#39;ll feel a little more useful again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well ok, as to the first part, the data may be relevant but it may not be relevant<br/>
to a discussion on whether bards are balanced or not with respect to the other<br/>
classes.  we kinda went through this on another thread, where there are quite a<br/>
few other reasons why someone would not want to play a bard which have nothing<br/>
to do with a bard&#39;s relative power to other classes.<br/>
<br/>
as to your effectiveness in your group here is one suggestion.  how often<br/>
do you get a 2 or 3 pull rather than a single pull?  this seems like the perfect<br/>
situation to talk with your friend the enchanter and set up a plan where you charm<br/>
one of the extras and use it to help fight.  if you twist hymn and nivs along with<br/>
charm you will hardly need any healing.  and i&#39;m not positive, but i&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
a level 46-50ish kunark mob will still outdamage a level 50-52ish rogue. also since<br/>
mana isn&#39;t too much of a problem, perhaps you would make a good puller, using<br/>
lament song to pull one or two, and chains or charm to bring them back without<br/>
you taking a lot of damage on the way back.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In any case, my point is, that the quantification of the power of a <br/>
&gt;class is very difficult.  And I feel it is quite bold of you to state <br/>
&gt;that we are overpowered.  Unfortunately for us, Verant seems to put <br/>
&gt;the weights in the same places you do.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, my personal relative weights are more weight to grouping over soloing and much<br/>
more weight to everyday experience hunting than ubermob raids.  this is mostly based<br/>
not on my personal method of gaming, but on what the majority of the players in everquest<br/>
are doing on a daily basis (well, to be more accurate, i should say my perception of what<br/>
the majority...) along with Verant&#39;s stated goal of making this a grouping game.</div>
