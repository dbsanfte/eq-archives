&gt;either :(<br/>

&gt; &gt; Nice come back.  That is exactly how I play (yea right)  What the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hell does this bug fix have to do with the songs I play?  It actually <br/>
&gt; &gt; forces me to rethink what songs I sing!  For instance, do I play <br/>
&gt; &gt; Celerity to get closer to max haste or do I play McVaxius?  In case <br/>
&gt; &gt; you missed something, this fix actually makes haste spell upgrades <br/>
&gt; &gt; worth something!  (Does this sound like a movie watching mana bard?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think that you got it backwards.  Many of you think that this just <br/>
&gt; &gt; adds to the &quot;nerfing us to total mana batteries&quot;  BS!  This makes me <br/>
&gt; &gt; re-evaluate my line up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S.  Thanks for ASSuming you know my playing style.<br/>
