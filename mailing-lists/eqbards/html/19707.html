Your idea makes too much sense so therefore will be immediately discarded as<br/>
not in compliance with The Vision(tm).<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] A possible way to make Disarm Traps useful?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I posted this idea to the gameplay boards, what do you fellow bards think<br/>
would something like this be work?<br/>
<br/>
If you like the idea of making Disarm Traps a skill that actually does<br/>
something hit the link below and add your ideas!<br/>
<br/>
Disarm Traps, the bane of EQ programmers?<br/>
Here&#39;s an idea on how to make a viable use of the skill without changing the<br/>
basic nature of the world. True it doesn&#39;t involve interaction with the game<br/>
environment, but I thought that was the problem anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is fairly simple. Start off by making an item called An Ornate Box.<br/>
If you examine it it appears to be a container with 4 slots that weighs 5.0<br/>
lbs. If you click on it to open it however instead of opening it casts a<br/>
spell like a magic item. The spell is cast on the holder of the item and<br/>
could be a poison DoT, a lightning DD, or whatever trap you like.<br/>
<br/>
The change to Disarm traps would be to allow the item to make a check on<br/>
Disarm Traps when attempting to open it. If the skill check is a success<br/>
then the trapped chest is replaced with a different item that represents the<br/>
treasure inside, much in the fashion of the Combine button changing the item<br/>
combined into a new one.<br/>
<br/>
This should be a feasible solution to making Disarm Traps useful, and would<br/>
no doubt greatly increase the call for rogues since only they and high level<br/>
bards could open these mysterious treasure boxes.<br/>
