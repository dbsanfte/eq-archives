 </span></blockquote>Yes.  That may have been part of the problem - there were only<br/>
two of us.  But like I said, we had him beat the first time -<br/>
I was so confident of it that I switched from PR with a drum<br/>
to my weapons so that I&#39;d be able to say I actually did some<br/>
damage to him in getting my Evensong.  He quad attacked me<br/>
twice after I switched.  I lost 2.5 bubbles each time despite<br/>
being buffed to 2200 hp.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I used during the first attempt.  My group was in<br/>
pretty good shape - we were all at 4+ bubbles with him down to<br/>
&#39;Mae&#39; and both clerics having almost half their mana.  But<br/>
then he started ping-ponging, our damage rate dropped to<br/>
almost zero, and he was gaining hp as we died.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem was that because he was quad-attacking, after<br/>
he was ping-ponged, the first tank to get to him usually ended<br/>
up eating 4-8 attacks in quick succession.  It&#39;s just a really<br/>
nasty configuration that I hope none of you ever run into.<br/>
