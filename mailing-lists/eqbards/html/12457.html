<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723341705">I&#39;ll agree that level does play a big part in resists.  But if you thing the<br/>
CR theory is &#39;bunk&#39;, then I wish you many happy dragon deaths until you<br/>
learn.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A buffed Magic Resist of 150 at level 50 has been enough to resist every<br/>
&gt; single fear thrown against us.  I have NEVER been feared with a MR in this<br/>
&gt; range.  Since we can achieve this 150 with only Elemental playing, there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not a real need for me to twist in a second song anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Level is the single most factor in resisting any spell.  I cannot stress<br/>
  that enough.  Magic resistance will then add to that factor.  This holds<br/>
  true for anything.  I&#39;ve had my MR over 125 at the kobold noble spot and<br/>
  have still been charmed around L40.  At L50, I resist it everytime even <br/>
  lower MR of 80 or so.<br/>
  <br/>
  I will investigate cold resist and fire resist against dragons more<br/>
  in the future.  But I&#39;ll tell you this.  With no buffs, and a CR of<br/>
  only 39, Vox&#39;s breathe weapon when she appeared in the King Room <br/>
  only did 200 dmg to me.  So that completely debunks the CR theory,<br/>
  and as I stated that you will resist it normally on your own via the<br/>
  random number generator.  I will look into it more.<br/>
<br/>
  I will also report that we had 54 f&#39;ing people at this Vox raid...<br/>
  wanna know how I stayed alive when all hell broke loose?  I knew<br/>
  this raid would fail as soon as I crashed 3 times in a row, and when<br/>
  5 or 6 people went LD after each battle so I took Harmonic up on the<br/>
  ledge that looks over the king room, stopped all songs, and just<br/>
  waited up there until all the ice giants were killed.  I told my group<br/>
  to move up with me as well, because it does take 54 people to kill<br/>
  a handful of terrors, spiders, and giants.  As soon as the shit hit<br/>
  the fan, /sit /camp /quit.  And I lived.  I honestly saw it coming,<br/>
  and was on the buttons subconsciously.<br/>
<br/>
  So the point here is, if you have 200 or so L50 people on your server,<br/>
  there&#39;s no reason to risk the lives of many by taking L40 people.<br/>
  Plus you&#39;ve got limited people to work with, obviously 12 people cannot<br/>
  do Vox, but neither can 54... jesus, I&#39;m having shivers from the lag <br/>
  last night.  24-30 people is probably optimal for doing _any_ mob in<br/>
  the whole game.  So with limited people, you need to take the right<br/>
  ones.  Again, if your server is strapped for people at the time of<br/>
  the raid, then you have to make do.  Otherwise, planning the right<br/>
  mix and level of people is key.  We had the right level of people<br/>
  last night, no one was invited unless they were L49 or L50.  Even<br/>
  had 4 bards show up.  There was just too many people there.<br/>
