<div id="ygrps-yiv-849204738">Well, last nite in Sol A was awesome!  Thanks all for the tips that helped<br/>
make it so.<br/>
I learned several things last nite that might benefit other bards so I&#39;ll<br/>
pass them along.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, 1 bard is not a tank.  I know most people are aware of this point,<br/>
but the corresponding lesson was a bit surprising to me.  Apparently while 1<br/>
bard is not a tank, 3 bards are 3 tanks.  Our group last night started out<br/>
as 3 bards, a druid, an enchanter, and a necromancer.  Later we lost the<br/>
druid but replaced him with a battle cleric(I hate to use the word cleric<br/>
with this guy, healing is always his secondary motivation).  Both groups<br/>
were enormously successful.  The bards were able to tank very effectively,<br/>
our taunt factors were close enough that merely stepping back caused the mob<br/>
to immediately switch to the next &#39;target bard&#39; in place so we could<br/>
distribute damage well.<br/>
<br/>
Lesson 2.  A necromancer is as valuable in a group as any other caster,<br/>
without his pet.  Our necromancer did not use a pet for 90% of the night in<br/>
order to let the enchanter do his job more easily.  The enchanter was still<br/>
very effective.  On several occasions we had to get mobs off of him.  Not in<br/>
most fights, but definitely in some.<br/>
<br/>
Lesson 3.  Lullaby is even more broken than I had pessimistically thought.<br/>
The enchanter was able to keep up to four extra white goblins mez&#39;d while<br/>
the group concentrated on one at a time on every occasion, without fail.  We<br/>
could not keep 1 extra blue goblin Nodded with two bards singing lullaby so<br/>
that it went off at different times.  It was pathetic to say the least.  We<br/>
tried to Lullaby 1 extra goblin and were only able to succeed about 30% of<br/>
the time.  We were set up so that I would keep Lullaby out of my regular<br/>
weave, being the lower level bard, and then if the other bard&#39;s Lullaby went<br/>
off and the untargeted Goblin did not nod completely, I would immediately<br/>
fire off my Lullaby.  It was a joke.  While the enchanter could have kept<br/>
that extra goblin mez&#39;d thru every fight of the entire night if we had<br/>
wanted him to, we couldn&#39;t even keep it mez&#39;d long enough to finish off one<br/>
of its fellows.  It was even worse when we first tried it with just one of<br/>
us Lullabying.  We had to zone.  Not only was I unable to keep the 1 extra<br/>
goblin Nodded, but after about 4 tries nothing the other bard could do could<br/>
possibly get either of the goblins off my back.  <br/>
<br/>
Lesson 4.  If you don&#39;t have fear, you can still reverse kite.  Just get two<br/>
bards, have one fire up lullaby about four or five times.  Lullaby bard then<br/>
flees from mob while second bards chains it.  Chaining bard can literally<br/>
beat the thing to death and it will never turn.<br/>
<br/>
Lesson 5.  A competent enchanter can be a powerful force.  They can&#39;t really<br/>
help you go after red mobs, but if you are facing a horde of whites/some<br/>
yellows they are awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Sol A has been great so far.  2 nights, 4 deaths and I still have 3.5<br/>
bubbles to show for it!<br/>
