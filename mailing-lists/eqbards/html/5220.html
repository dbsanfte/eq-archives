&gt; Also, I&#39;m in the US Army and have been playing EQ since April.  Until today<br/>
&gt; I have never seen/heard the term Black Helicopter used as a reference to<br/>
&gt; anything, military or EQ related.  What does this reference mean?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know the original reference for this, but the idea in general is that<br/>
the army/cia have special &quot;black helicopters&quot; that make no sounds that fly<br/>
around at night spying on everyone.  It&#39;s frequently cited by paranoids as part<br/>
of their persecution complex &quot;CIA black helicopters... spying on me... listening<br/>
to everything I have to say&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
To the general public, the phrase &quot;black helicopters&quot; is generally used to refer<br/>
to something that crazy people think exists, but don&#39;t really.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, as a member of the US Army, I&#39;m sure you know ALL about them, you&#39;re<br/>
just not allowed to mention them to us.  :)<br/>
<br/>
As for what happened to JM... I suspect the helicopters were involved there, too<br/>
