&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will probably regret sending this mail .. Please remember this is my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>first mail list and I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months now, so<br/>
many of these comcepts are still new to me (Twinking, Item Camping, farming<br/>
??). I have read the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the<br/>
concept.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a very high<br/>
 </span></blockquote>level player, I did not understand the EXP share problem. He just asked me<br/>
to keep singing my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with him<br/>
for several hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this<br/>
he said he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him I<br/>
needed exp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for me<br/>
and initiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and he<br/>
said yes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a<br/>
pair of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I could<br/>
see via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too good<br/>
for my level. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if I<br/>
should wear them/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with<br/>
twinking but dont want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an<br/>
opinion on what I should!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
