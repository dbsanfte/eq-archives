&gt;The petition (posted at least twice today) brought to light several *very*<br/>
&gt;important Bardic issues (I can only hope that the other classes have as<br/>
&gt;much itelligent discussion going on.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agreed with all your points, and registered that in the petition.<br/>
<br/>
I think, however, that if we lost plate mail, we would need to <br/>
get some better ac or spell shield effect in the buff lines.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t think we should get bind any more than rangers, paladins<br/>
or sk&#39;s.  I actually saw a post stating that monks should have bind<br/>
at high levels, some idea that a high level monk was so in touch with<br/>
his chi that he could bind it to a spot :)<br/>
<br/>
Bind should stay the purview of the pure casters, as should gate.<br/>
