******************************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
February 3rd, 8:00am<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
The following changes have been implemented on the live servers:<br/>
<br/>
*Spells*<br/>
<br/>
- Lay On Hands: Enhanced to heal more hitpoints per level.<br/>
- Enveloping Roots: Casting time reduced to match Immobilize<br/>
- Skin Like Nature: Small Damage Shield added. This will stack with other <br/>
shields.<br/>
- Insidious Fever: Casting time reduced.<br/>
- Insidious Malady: Casting time Reduced.<br/>
- Burnout series: Negative HP component removed to bring it in line with the <br/>
Necromancer&#39;s Intensify/Augment death series.<br/>
<br/>
*Songs*<br/>
<br/>
- Syvelian&#39;s Anti-magic Aura: Potency increased.<br/>
- Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding: Now also grants See Invisible. Party members <br/>
can now see each other while under the effect of this song.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the following songs have been given a slightly larger radius:<br/>
- Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
- Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles<br/>
- Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>
- Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre<br/>
<br/>
*PvP-Teams Change*<br/>
<br/>
Customers on the PvP-Teams servers have been plagued by a tactic known as <br/>
&quot;Bind Rushing&quot;. Casters would bind themselves in a hostile area or dungeon, <br/>
and attack everyone of an opposing race in the area. Sooner or later the <br/>
caster would die. They would then respawn, memorize a few spells, then jump <br/>
back in to attack their wounded opponents.<br/>
<br/>
As a first step in combating this practice and improving life for those on <br/>
the PvP-Servers, casters will now respawn with zero mana after being killed <br/>
by another player in a duel or open combat.<br/>
<br/>
This code is new for those on Tallon and Vallon Zek. It has been in place <br/>
for some time on Rallos Zek and works very well there.<br/>
<br/>
*The Plane of Sky*<br/>
<br/>
All spells that grant levitation will no longer function in the Plane of <br/>
Sky. This affects spells cast by Wizards, Enchanters, Shamans, Druids, <br/>
Necromancers, and Bards. The Plane of Sky is designed to be completed in <br/>
certain fashion, and the existence of these spells allowed the islands to be <br/>
completed out-of-order.<br/>
<br/>
A teleporter will be placed on the first island in the next patch to allow <br/>
people access to the room below.<br/>
