<div id="ygrps-yiv-651952252">Since the moderator is a tad busy, I&#39;d like to step in and unofficially<br/>
Kabong! the threads dealing with Twinking, Asheron&#39;s Call, trade skills,<br/>
&quot;Druids are too weak&quot;, and Brad McQuaid&#39;s fake hairpiece. (just figured I&#39;d<br/>
cover all the bases there ;)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s get back a bit on topic, which is Bards, and everything Bardish.<br/>
<br/>
Let me start you off:<br/>
<br/>
Since the &quot;Identify&quot; song (Lyssa&#39;s Cataloguing Libretto) is totally<br/>
useless, they will likely replace it someday.  What would YOU (as Bards)<br/>
like to see it replaced with?<br/>
<br/>
Second question: What do you fear more: a blue spellcaster, a white/black<br/>
grunt, or a train of greens?  How do you handle each?<br/>
