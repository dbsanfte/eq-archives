<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657644384">For my all my ripping of Verant and their high minded arrogence, they<br/>
deserve praise for this.  They saw they made a mistake (class based xp<br/>
penalty) and (finally) fixed it.  Plain and simple. Their solution is nearly<br/>
identical to the one I proposed to my friends (the ones that play EQ), so<br/>
obviously I like it.  hmmm...  (Elfson checks his living room for bugs)<br/>
<br/>
The added xp for dungeon is nice, will benefit my group greatly as we make<br/>
it a point to explore all those under used dungeons and in fact our next two<br/>
targets are Nurga and Kaesora, heh...  However it will do little to get<br/>
people there.  The reason Lake, Oasis, Front Mts, South Karana, Dreadland,<br/>
Karnors are all crowded is because, well..., they are crowded.  Huh?  What I<br/>
mean is people go there because its where they know they will be able to<br/>
find a pick up group.  If people decided that Swamp of No Hope was the place<br/>
to be, it would overcrowded and Lake would sit empty. I assume Lake became<br/>
the hotbed it is because its convient location for all races (especially<br/>
good since they represent most the games population).   I dont expect to see<br/>
people hanging out in the entrance room of Najena shouting &quot;22 warrior<br/>
looking to join Trazden camp&quot;.  However for the people with the organization<br/>
and friends to do it, these changes will be a nice plus...<br/>
<br/>
The grouping bonus is nice, but I dont know if it will do much to change the<br/>
percent of players who group vs solo.  It cant hurt though.  And again I<br/>
group all the time so I am happy...</div>
