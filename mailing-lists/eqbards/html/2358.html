 </span></blockquote>Interesting point.  I would prefer that we pressure Verant for some sort of<br/>
pace meter, to use in conjunction with either Sense Heading or a compass.  It<br/>
remains my contention that using an out-of-game mechanism to make up for what<br/>
we believe is an in-game lack must be done carefully and with minimum<br/>
intrusion.<br/>
<br/>
One could argue that this mailing list is exactly one of those out-of-game<br/>
mechanisms, and one would be right.  We trade information here in both in-game<br/>
and out-of-game terms, mixing those somewhat freely.  My rationalization for<br/>
that is, say, a mystical collection of scrying pools where people can exchange<br/>
messages amongst agreeable communities using appropriate incantations.  Except<br/>
when discussiong game bugs or otherwise forced, I&#39;d prefer to keep this forum<br/>
as in-game as possible.<br/>
<br/>
So obviously I see a gray area rather than a clear line for what&#39;s<br/>
appropriate.  For me personally, /loc is just too far over the line, to the<br/>
point that I&#39;d rather suffer lack of ability than use it.<br/>

Regarding the discussion of whether bards can appropriately wear plate armor, I<br/>
must say I do feel it a bit excessive for one who builds a life around song,<br/>
entertainment, and personal charm.  On the other hand the reality of life on<br/>
Norrath is that it is harsh and to fulfil our part in strengthening our groups,<br/>
we bards must stay alive.  Since we find plate armor available, it fits us, and<br/>
we have the strength, I for one will wear it gladly when I must and not<br/>
question the magic that lets me play my lute with fingers encased in steel.<br/>
<br/>
Then when I play for a crowd or visit a merchant, I will likely change into my<br/>
silk evening shirt and the amulet and earrings that give me magnetism and charm<br/>
without a skin of steel.  If I had such desirable jewelery...<br/>
