<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122386119">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
My name is Bruen Bladesong a bard of the 21st song on Erollisi Marr. I have<br/>
been lurking for a while but have been having a hard time recently so I<br/>
thought I would ask for some advice.<br/>
<br/>
Basically the problem is that I keep getting killed ) I am fairly well<br/>
equipped with mostly bronze armour except for crested spaulders, thick<br/>
leather apron, black iron crown and some bracers. I&#39;m also wearing some good<br/>
jewellery and have these states:<br/>
<br/>
STR: 100  AGI: 93   DEX: 121   CHA: 100<br/>
<br/>
My weapons are a silvery war axe and an obsidian shard.<br/>
<br/>
The gear is mostly thanks to my cleric, Sanan Starbright who retired and<br/>
left all his stuff to Bruen )<br/>
<br/>
All my weapon and music skills are maxed for my level and I have all my<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
All in all I think an above average character for my level. I play a<br/>
fighter-bard so mostly use my weapons rather that fight with instruments.<br/>
<br/>
But still I keep getting killed. I can solo fine but dont like to, grouping<br/>
is more fun.<br/>
<br/>
When the puller starts to look I turn off all my songs, and get out my<br/>
weapons. Then once the pull arrives and we get stuck in I start twisting<br/>
Anthem and  Guardian if I&#39;m in a warrior-heavy group (I usually am) and just<br/>
Guardian if I am in a mage-heavy group.  Later on I usually twist in Largos<br/>
Binding or Lullaby if the fight is going badly. I add resists as needed.<br/>
<br/>
I would welcome any comments on my tactics.<br/>
<br/>
What seems to happen is that I end up with all the mobs on me and I get<br/>
ripped apart.<br/>
<br/>
This is what happened to me in Unrest last time. I was in a group with a<br/>
level 25 Warrior (the puller), a level 22 Shadow Knight, a level 20 Shaman,<br/>
a level 20 Wizard and a level 23 Necromancer. I had my weapons out and no<br/>
songs playing when the puller came back with a Dry Bone and two Dark Bones.<br/>
Before I even started playing a song or attacking all 3 were on me and could<br/>
not be taunted off me, so I died. This was only my 3rd time in Unrest, not a<br/>
good start. Somehow I always seem to end up with all the mobs on me even<br/>
without playing Largos or Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
Where am I going wrong? Or is bard hate really this bad? If it is that bad<br/>
then how do you all manage?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have been in some great groups, one in particular in<br/>
Mistmoore so its not all bad, I&#39;m really looking to see if anyone has any<br/>
tips or if it is this bad for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
