 Cool :)<br/>
No one knows the dmg equation for CoD?  Thats actually one of the more<br/>
important ones =)  I&#39;ve been kiting yellow gorge hounds at level 15 (just<br/>
got 16) and wasn&#39;t able to tell if weaving selos/bellow/cod was better than<br/>
selos/bellow/bellow (using strings).  Any help is appreciated...oh, anyone<br/>
know if I would be able to kite griffawns like this?   I hear they run the<br/>
same speed as hounds, and I never actually get hit while kiting...I just<br/>
sorta run around in a circle to the beat of my own footsteps =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
