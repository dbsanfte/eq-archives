<b>Subject:</b> On the topic of petitions (long, but an important read) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-120044472">I for one am not really big on the idea of petitions, they tend to get way<br/>
out of hand, and people start asking for ridiculous things.  I can&#39;t believe<br/>
that any of these get taken seriously by Verant.<br/>
Here&#39;s what I propose:  Let&#39;s put together a small list of our biggest<br/>
complaints over the next couple of days.  After we&#39;ve hashed them out a bit,<br/>
I&#39;ll mail them on to Geoffrey Zatkin.  I got a pretty prompt reply out of<br/>
him last time I sent him some questions, so maybe we can get some answers<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
What I will not do is send a list of complaints or demands.  All I want is<br/>
answers to when/if certain things will be fixed/implemented.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
this to turn into a bitch fest.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to demand new skills or songs, the primary concern is to get<br/>
things fixed that are currently broken or missing.  I feel these issues<br/>
should be addressed before we go asking for new features.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get the ball rolling with my standard list of gripes.  If you have any<br/>
suggestion/changes/additions, please post them, and lets get some discussion<br/>
going. <br/>
<br/>
1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>
game.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>
they are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>
at least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>
get them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>
questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
2) Several of our skills (Hiding, Sneak, Forage, Instill Doubt) cap at such<br/>
low levels, that they aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of<br/>
these, but if the caps were raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>
1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
3) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>
effect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>
does not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>
it protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>
this song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>
<br/>
4) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>
looks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>
patch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>
regularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>
expect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>
equipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>
wrists.<br/>
<br/>
5) There seems to be an absense of any high level bard quests.  Is there any<br/>
implementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are my primary concerns.  In addition, but IMHO less important, but<br/>
open for discussion:<br/>
<br/>
a) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>
monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?  Is this<br/>
intentional or a bug?  <br/>
<br/>
b) When a magical effect wears off (i.e. Guise of the Deciever) our songs<br/>
get stuck.  The /st command does not unstick them in this situation and we<br/>
have to resort to speed mashing of the buttons to unstick them.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, guess that&#39;s about it.  I&#39;m fairly confident that if we put together a<br/>
well-worded message to GZ, we&#39;ll at least get a reply.  Heck, he responded<br/>
to me in less than a day last time.  I&#39;m not expecting any instant fixes,<br/>
I&#39;ll be happy just getting some answers.<br/>
<br/>
Please offer up any suggestions you can.<br/>
