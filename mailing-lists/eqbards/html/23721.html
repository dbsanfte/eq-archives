 </span></blockquote>Heh. Maybe you should take into consideration that many of us read the<br/>
entire post and then, with considerable experience of Verant&#39;s past<br/>
history on positive changes, discounted that part completely. We&#39;re<br/>
still waiting for the improvements to PoS that they promised they&#39;d look<br/>
at 5 months ago. Verant has a long, consistant history of foot dragging<br/>
on postitive improvements. As well, 5 mobs is really a stretch. The mere<br/>
fact that they admit to specifically tuning 5 mobs to expected use of<br/>
the BP shows they had an expectation of it being used when designing<br/>
encounters in Velious, and many more than 5 show this, from my guild&#39;s<br/>
experiences in fighting them<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m actually in agreement that the BP was overpowered, but only in that<br/>
complete heal is the most unbalancing spell in the game. What I&#39;m not in<br/>
agreement with is blindly accepting everything VI says. I would have<br/>
though someone playing a Bard would have more experience with VI&#39;s<br/>
ability to distort the facts at will. Or are you too new to remember the<br/>
chains debacle?<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone reading this list remember a mob that they ever tuned down in<br/>
difficulty?<br/>
