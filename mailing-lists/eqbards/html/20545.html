<b>Subject:</b> Mages soloing..... err Grouping? (was Mistmoore and Dark elf camp in Lesser Faydark) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-769193034">i agree, and to make a sweeping generalization if i may :)<br/>
<br/>
Mages cant group<br/>
<br/>
To many times i have seen mages nuke a runner down when it wasnt necessary,<br/>
nuke a messed mob or generally just solo in a group (if thats possible).<br/>
<br/>
Last night, i grouped with a few of my good friends in our alternate group<br/>
<br/>
In this group is a bard (me) an enchanter, shaman and magician. Now in our<br/>
regular group the person playing the mage plays one of the best ever<br/>
paladins i have seen, and i would trust her with my life, and have all too<br/>
frequently. Now i dont know what it is about mages, or if they are hard to<br/>
play (never played one) or if this paladin just cant play a caster, but<br/>
there is nothing better than hearing &quot;That is not a legal target master&quot; at<br/>
least 10 times each fight :), and wondering why gobaner isnt doing anything,<br/>
or why the mage used a 300 damage nuke on a mob with 20 HP left, or why she<br/>
continuly attacked the messed mobs or ......<br/>
<br/>
Anyway if anyone has any positive mage grouping experiences please share<br/>
them as i would like to know so perhaps i can change my mage friends&#39; ways.<br/>

&gt; &gt;every time I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; joined a group with one, it appears to me as if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are soloing while<br/>
&gt; &gt; only notionally grouping (if that makes sense).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A scene from the Temple room in Dalnir:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (after a heavy fight)<br/>
&gt; Magician: WhhooooHhooooo!  We rule!  Ain&#39;t my AOE<br/>
&gt; spell Purty?<br/>
&gt; Enchanter: Very nice -- except it cancels out my mezz<br/>
&gt; spells.<br/>
&gt; Magician: Then don&#39;t use Mezz.<br/>
&gt; Bard: But (name deleted) the AOE mezz is a crowd<br/>
&gt; control spell that keeps us alive...<br/>
&gt; Magician: I AM CROWD CONTROL!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; sheesh<br/>
