Tszaaz spent 17-20 (the pull that got him 20 was so chaotic that the ding<br/>
actually was a tad anti-climactic!)  in E. Karana on Gnoll Reavers... they<br/>
are a blast as well as reasonable exp and money  once you figure out how to<br/>
pull them. Might be perfect for your Ogre, er, though you can&#39;t run to the<br/>
Barbarian Guards :o)<br/>
<br/>
There is a point where they come closest to the river, turn and head back<br/>
(sorry exact loc is at home) hang there and pull to the river, choose your<br/>
pull *carefully* at all costs do not pull War Wolves! They bite infrequently<br/>
and for about 3 damage when alone but will join in with any Gnoll that is<br/>
attacked and when fighting like that hit for 20 per bite. If you kill the<br/>
Gnoll they revert to being weak btw so they should be made a second<br/>
priority.<br/>
<br/>
Lately (25) farther I have been attacked by Undead Reavers and Dark Reavers<br/>
(doggies) that actually give exp at 25, so be careful out there. :o)<br/>
