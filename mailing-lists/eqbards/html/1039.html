<div id="ygrps-yiv-501684564">Yes, you are right, but even a jack of all trades should be able to do these<br/>
things with a reasonable amount of skill, not to the Very low levels we are<br/>
kept. Thats just my 2 cents anyway<br/>

&gt; &gt;Dual wield at 17 is really cool, and Bellows in place of kick is fine,<br/>

&gt; &gt;why no dual attack?  Apparently the bardic class was VERY powerful in<br/>
beta<br/>
&gt; &gt;and had to be toned down but I am thinking maybe it was toned down in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;areas that made it too powerful and forgotten about in the areas it is<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; &gt;weak in.  Am I totally off base?  I mean why give me the capability to<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt;skills I will never be very good at?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Paladins also do not get dual attack.  It&#39;s what makes a warrior<br/>
&gt; special.  Remember, we can even wear plate (which I personally think is a<br/>
&gt; mistake.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) cf. JOAT (Jack of All Trades, Master of None.)  We can do a lot of<br/>
&gt; different things - but we will never be the masters at any one of them<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; the class we&#39;re borrowing them from is.  Rogues will always be better<br/>
&gt; lockpickers, sneakers and trap disarmers. Monks will always fall better<br/>
&gt; than we can.  Rangers will always forage better.  And Warriors will always<br/>
&gt; fight better.  It is not in a single thing that we are great, but that in<br/>
&gt; all things we are good.<br/>
