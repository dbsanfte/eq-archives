<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650246190">The same thing has happened to me, and I wasn&#39;t playing any songs.  I think <br/>
people just look for all the reasons why the boat might be crashing and try <br/>
to eliminate them.  I&#39;ve heard people say all sorts of things; Don&#39;t fish, <br/>
don&#39;t use magic, don&#39;t stand up, don&#39;t sit down, don&#39;t move around, don&#39;t <br/>
sing, don&#39;t talk.  As far as I can tell, the boat crashes because it <br/>
crashes, and there&#39;s very little you can do to avoid it.<br/>

&gt;     I had one heck of a night trying to get back to Freeport from <br/>
&gt;Butcherblock - the boat crashed  three times.  What would happen is first <br/>
&gt;all the other players on the boat would disappear then you&#39;d get dumped...  <br/>
&gt;The first time I was back on the dock in BB then next time on the boat on <br/>
&gt;the way to BB and then finally on the boat on the way to Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny players claimed <br/>
&gt;that the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on the boat...  The <br/>
&gt;first time I was in fact playing a song and thought that it might <br/>
&gt;contribute.  The second time - no bards were playing (assuming no one in <br/>
&gt;the hold was) and it crashed anyways.  I think this was true the third dump <br/>
&gt;as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     So I am wondering if people have any experience in this.  My gut is <br/>
&gt;that there is no relation between the two - and this is yet another myth <br/>
&gt;(like all bard songs will require mana!)<br/>
