<div id="ygrps-yiv-605629586">I have a better area that you are almost garunteed to be messed with. in<br/>
Ecommons if you goto the tunnel opening to ecommon. follow the wall back to<br/>
freeport as high as you can go you will eventually come up to a plateu that<br/>
nothing ever ever ever comes up there. so you will be completely free from<br/>
npcs. heck I have never even seen a PC walk up that high because it is<br/>
almost next to the zone but the only way you can get there is heading toward<br/>
freeport. Tho Arena is good place to be if you dont go into the PVP section<br/>
of the Arena.<br/>

&gt; Okay,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brass horns are sold in Kelethin, Freeport, and Qeynos bard guilds.  I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; seen them for sale in all three places.  Krak sells them, as well.  To get<br/>
&gt; Krak to sell to you, as dubious, use the &#39;sneak&#39; method.  Get a successful<br/>
&gt; sneak going, and he will be indifferent to you.  Right click, and viola,<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; can sell/buy with Krak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, for your brass skill...Get lots of food and water, then go to the<br/>
&gt; Arena, off of Lake Rathe.  (Into the water from zone, off to the right,<br/>
&gt; where an Avi is (sometimes) sitting on a dock, near two Chicken Huts).<br/>
Get<br/>
&gt; bound or not...doesn&#39;t matter.  Zone into the hallway, and step away from<br/>
&gt; the zone, to be nice to all the fine folks coming here to get bound.  Have<br/>
&gt; DDD memmed up, equip that horn, and start...c&#39;mon, start...i mean<br/>
&gt; start...after all those missed notes, get DDD started.  Sit or stand,<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, now IRL, go away for a while.  Go to bed, go to work, go get<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; to eat...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From one practice point in brass (which should have given me a skill of 12<br/>
&gt; (lvl 11 + 1 practive point), since I put my point into it when I could) it<br/>
&gt; took me approximately 4 hours to max my brass skill at 95 for level 18<br/>
&gt; (5*lvl + 5).  I have heard of some doing it in closer to 2 hours, and some<br/>
&gt; taking longer.  IF you did NOT put a point into brass at 11, and waited<br/>
&gt; until 18th, your skill increases will be faster, since you don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; overcome those hard-to-get 7, and may shorten the time required immensely.<br/>
&gt; If you put alot of practice points into it, it should reduce the time as<br/>
&gt; well.  Due to the clumpy number generator, though, these times may vary<br/>
&gt; greatly, just due to lags in improvement and large jumps in improvement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other areas, which I don&#39;t consider to be as safe to do this:<br/>
&gt; Far back in the cave behind Shady Swashbuckler, in East Commons  (someone<br/>
&gt; could screw up, attack him, and lead him your direction)<br/>
&gt; Newbie area, out by zone line - sitting near one of the zone lines in<br/>
front<br/>
&gt; of the gates of a city - again, someone could drag a guard out far enough<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be affected, and they kill quick.<br/>
&gt; Just over zone line from WFP into NRO.  Dark Elf - &#39;nuff said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All in all, Arena seems to best place to do this.  Only players there, and<br/>
&gt; usually only those coming to bind.  Just step out of the way, maybe around<br/>
&gt; corner, and no-one will notice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good Luck<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think the reason there is unfinished horns is the same reason why<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are lute strings. as you may know there has been rumors that there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill we will get eventually if they ever get it working that allows us<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; create instruments. Problem is going to krak the aviak merchant is I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; dubious to him. So I guess Ill just have shout out for someone with<br/>
&gt; faction<br/>
&gt; &gt; to look for me. Thanks for the info.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason no animation is seen is because you dont have a target, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wont affect skill increase. If I remeber correctly I bought my horn in<br/>
&gt; FP<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the bard guild. If for some reason they no longer sell it, Krap<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Windbreaker...err Krak the aviak vendor sells them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not know what the unfinished trumpet is for. I have seen it but<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; heard anyone say what it might be used for.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyways, g&#39;luck to ya.<br/>
