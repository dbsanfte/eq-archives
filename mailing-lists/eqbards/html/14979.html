<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721330222">Only Verant would think boats shouldn&#39;t run on a set schedule!  Too<br/>
convenient?  I wish there was some way I could set the RL time schedule of<br/>
whoever dreamed this up at Verant.<br/>

	Chef:	&quot;Oh, you know it would be too convenient if you knew exactly<br/>
when 		 your dinner would arrive so we made it random.  You missed<br/>
it by 		 3 minutes, come back tomorrow.&quot;<br/>

About a RL hour and a half to a Norrathian day I believe.  <br/>
Back when there was only one FP&lt;-&gt;BB boat, it did a round trip<br/>
once every 12 game hours, which was 45 minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
Since it would&#39;ve been too convenient for people to be able to<br/>
type /time and figure the boat was going to arrive in 4 game<br/>
hours, Verant decided to make it not quite 12 game hours so<br/>
the exact time during the day drifts with each successive<br/>
trip.  :P</div>
