	I have a question about one of your statements in your previous<br/>
post:<br/>
<br/>
		Dumping skill points into it won&#39;t make it level faster by<br/>
use.  1 skill or<br/>
		100, the chances of skilling are the same every swing, all<br/>
else being equal.<br/>
<br/>
	From my experience, I have not found this to be true in the case of<br/>
non-combat skills.  When I first created my character, I trained one point<br/>
in sense-heading.  I continually used that skill when moving around.<br/>
However, it almost never went up.  By the time I was 7th level, my sense<br/>
heading was only 5.  I got tired of getting lost so I put 5 more points in<br/>
it to raise it to 10.  Within the next hour or so, my skill in Sense Heading<br/>
increased to 20. I&#39;m now 15th level.  I can now max out my skill in Sense<br/>
Heading every time I level within five minutes.  My experience with alcohol<br/>
tolerance was very similar.  <br/>
<br/>
	Could you please clarify your original statement?  Were you<br/>
referring to combat skills only are were you referring to all skills?<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks<br/>
