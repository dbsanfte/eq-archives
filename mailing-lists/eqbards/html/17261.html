<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926336644">My understanding is that GeForce based video cards are state-of-the-art at<br/>
the moment - but I haven&#39;t done much research lately as I don&#39;t plan on<br/>
upgrading in the immediate future.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Sound; while I don&#39;t want to trivialize the problems that a few<br/>
people have been having; I do believe the SB Live family of cards is not<br/>
only the superior products - but I would severely caution going with the<br/>
alternative.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the problems; I&#39;ve never seen the slightest one.  I have an<br/>
original Soundblaster Live purchased shortly after it was released.  The<br/>
vast majority of the problems are from people who don&#39;t keep their drivers<br/>
current.  Also - there are problems with people who updated the drivers -<br/>
but not the &quot;Liveware&quot; Software.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the alternative; the A3D chipset is made by Aureal.  They also<br/>
went into the business of producing cards themselves.  Aureal is on the<br/>
verge of bankruptcy.  If they don&#39;t get an investor or are bought out - you<br/>
could face the prospect of having unsupported software.<br/>
<br/>
I have been more than pleased with my SB Live - and I&#39;ve never had a single<br/>
problem with it.  Just make sure you keep the drivers and Liveware<br/>
up-to-date.<br/>

&gt; Speaking of building a new machine, what do you recommend as far as<br/>
hardware<br/>
&gt; is concerned for a relatively high-end system that EQ will run well on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I currently use Dual SLI Voodoo2 cards and glide drivers and I know there<br/>
&gt; are issues with Mip mapping, gamma correction, and clip plane on other<br/>
&gt; chipsets (TnT?). What would be the best choice AGP 3d hardware out there<br/>
&gt; these days in everyone&#39;s opinion?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also hear all kinds of problems with the Soundblaster 3d live cards that<br/>
&gt; we have discussed here, what do people in general feel is the best sound<br/>
&gt; hardware solution?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometime within the next few months I too hope to upgrade from my current<br/>
&gt; Pii333 PCI bus machine to a whiz-bang platform but with all the choices<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure what direction to go in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize this is pretty off topic but if anyone has any sound advice I<br/>
&gt; would greatly appreciate it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; dunno i will try after i build my new super-mega gaming<br/>
&gt; &gt; machine tomorrow.  i<br/>
&gt; &gt; know i can not do it now on a pii-333, 128mb, pos compaq on cablemodem<br/>
&gt; &gt; connection.  maybe piii-733 with 3d prophet ddr will help woohoo.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I know that the theory says that 3 songs should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; optimized, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been weaving 4 when soloing out of a vague feeling<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the total<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; effect was most beneficial (at level 24-26 it&#39;s been DDD,<br/>
&gt; &gt; CoD, Chains,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hymn). With the new DoT messages it appears that I can keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everything going<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the DoTs wear off as I am starting the new DoT. (I play<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on a P2 266 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 56K modem and this is still no problem most places). Am I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; missing something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still?<br/>
