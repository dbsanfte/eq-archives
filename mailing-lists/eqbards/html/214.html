&gt;I could spend hours trying to correct a lot of misinformation being posted<br/>
&gt;by some people. I would ask that if you aren&#39;t 100% sure about the<br/>
&gt;information you give, don&#39;t post it as a statement, rather ask it as a<br/>
&gt;question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It reveals to me there&#39;s a lot of poor deductive logic going on with some<br/>
&gt;players - drawing conclusions from game experiences that are more based on<br/>
&gt;coincidence than on good research.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>
&gt;going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>
&gt;truth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s a big difference between:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;---- &quot;Hill Giants can outrun Selo&#39;s&quot;<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;---- &quot;A Hill Giant seemed to outrun my Selo&#39;s, has anyone else seen this?&quot;<br/>
&gt;The complicated thing is that one MAY have tested this fully, and thus<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>

&gt;---- &quot;I tried running 10 times from a Hill Giant and here are the<br/>
&gt;results....&quot;<br/>
