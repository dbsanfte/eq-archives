<div id="ygrps-yiv-493414553"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Look, there must be something else going on here because<br/>
&gt; except for the situations I&#39;ve outlined (very high blues and<br/>
&gt; higher, magic resist buffs), I pretty much haven&#39;t had a<br/>
&gt; problem with Chain.  At least two other high level bards have<br/>
&gt; posted pretty much agreeing with me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m currently level 45 and have been having &quot;stick&quot; problems with this song<br/>
since the mid 30&#39;s against everything from SG&#39;s to Greater Kobolds.  What<br/>
level are the bards that can get this to stick 95% of the time?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; no way did I mean it as a criticism of your character.  Again,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry you took it the wrong way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>np, I&#39;m a bit sensitive today...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unfortunately, Chain wearing off does not generate a message,<br/>
&gt; so it won&#39;t show up in a logfile.  All I can say is that<br/>
&gt; except for the exceptions I listed, a mob I&#39;m chaining being<br/>
&gt; able to run consistently enough to cause problems is the rare<br/>
&gt; exception, not the rule.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The eye and crusader are outside the maze, and thus heavily<br/>
&gt; camped.  My friends and I have spent a lot of time in LGuk<br/>
&gt; lately on Karana, and the only time I have problems finding<br/>
&gt; stuff to pull is when the king, noble, elder, and patriarch<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ha! Last time the Patriarch/elder/noble/king weren&#39;t camped I &#39;bout fell off<br/>
my chair, called on the guild, assembled a group and by the time we got<br/>
there, another group had already started camping the spot...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are *all* camped.  Heck, I practically gained half my<br/>
&gt; experience in 48 soloing there during peak hours.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>solo?  What&#39;s that?</div>
