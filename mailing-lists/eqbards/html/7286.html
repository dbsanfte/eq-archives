<div id="ygrps-yiv-340486865">No - this is not the reason.  I never use Accelerando while fighting - I<br/>
tested it right after the patch was put in.  It NEVER broke root.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me one of three things has happened:<br/>
<br/>
1) They have changed it since the patch first appeared (I haven&#39;t been<br/>
trying it under the assumption it does nothing)<br/>
2) Level is a factor - and never kicked in for me when I tested it.<br/>
3) The Root duration is pretty random anyway - perhaps the people when<br/>
people thought they &quot;broke&quot; it - it simply wore off at the same time.<br/>

&gt; Perhaps it has to do with whether Accelerando is currently up at the time.<br/>
&gt; Maybe if you have it up when you get rooted, you can&#39;t break it with<br/>
accel,<br/>
&gt; but if you aren&#39;t singing it when you&#39;re rooted, it will break it.  It<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be too far fetched considering the weirdness involved with these<br/>
&gt; interactions we&#39;ve seen in the past.<br/>
