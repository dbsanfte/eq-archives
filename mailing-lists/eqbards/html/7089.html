<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-893720234">Thanks John.  Since I&#39;m gonna try my hat at soloing for a while, think I<br/>
might start having this song memorized.  Its too bad that it won&#39;t teleport<br/>
the entire party to the same random location.  Do you guys think this is<br/>
something that we should ask Verant to consider changing somewhere down the<br/>
road?  Since it would help the entire party, and doesn&#39;t impact solo play at<br/>
all, it shouldn&#39;t be a class balance issue.  <br/>

&gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; if the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I sing that song<br/>
&gt; &gt; while at the top of the village (or any high altitude location), will I<br/>
&gt; &gt; appear at the same altitude over the ground, and as a result take lots<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage due to falling?  Or will I end up on the ground wherever the song<br/>
&gt; &gt; sends me to? <br/>

&gt; Comments: Teleports you and your party members a random distance in a<br/>
&gt; random direction.  The distance seems to be dependent on level and whether<br/>
&gt; or not you&#39;re using a wind instrument.  It might&#39;ve been marginally useful<br/>
&gt; as a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a<br/>
&gt; different random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or<br/>
&gt; closed doors.  It will place you at ground level.<br/>
