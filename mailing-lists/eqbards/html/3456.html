<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070557980">Hate to bring this up again, but we Bards seem more like the semi-caster<br/>
shamans and clerics than the Paladins and Shadowknights.  I don&#39;t see why we<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have bind as a result, probably only on ourselves though.  It<br/>
could replace the leel 14 song nicely, unless they plan on making that one<br/>
worth buying.<br/>
<br/>
Kitasi the well travelled and poorer for it?</div>
