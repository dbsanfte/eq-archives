&gt; <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s hard now, but Shada started on day one and there was NO <br/>
&gt; crowding and my<br/>
&gt; wife and i both play so that&#39;s a lot of time spent on the <br/>
&gt; character.  as far<br/>
&gt; as my other characters, can&#39;t say i didn&#39;t have help <br/>
&gt; (remember some thread<br/>
&gt; about twinking hehe). the other characters are a lot of fun, <br/>
&gt; and sometimes<br/>
&gt; level in spurts when i get bored or Shada has nothing to do.  <br/>
&gt; that will<br/>
&gt; definitely change Wednesday, can you say LAMBENT armor? wooo.<br/>
