<b>Subject:</b> Galtin&#39;s late night adventure in Unrest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-550156587">Last night I was in Unrest after midnight Hawaii time.  There were a total<br/>
of seven people in the zone.  Fortunately, one of the players was a 36th<br/>
level cleric in my guild.  She was grouped with a 33 bard.  I joined with<br/>
them in the basement and our goal was to get two bracelets for the bards.  <br/>
<br/>
The cleric went Invis and found a GDB behind the hidden wall.  She was full<br/>
mana and decided to solo a GDB that she found.  She was doing OK and told us<br/>
to stay by the stairs.  She killed the GDB and confirmed that it dropped a<br/>
bracelet.  The other bard and I randomed for it and I won.  Before I could<br/>
loot the GDB, the cleric got jumped by two werebats.  She returned to the<br/>
stairs and by the time we finished them off, the cleric was out of mana.  I<br/>
was unfamiliar with the layout of the basement so had to wait on her to<br/>
guide me to the GDB corpse.  She medded up and cast Invis Undead on the two<br/>
of us.  We got to the corpse and I clicked on it to target it.  Not a<br/>
microsecond later, the corpse disappeared.  The eight minute time limit<br/>
elapsed right before I right clicked on it to loot.  <br/>
<br/>
To add to the misfortune, we got jumped by a festering hag and another<br/>
greater dark bone.  We fought them at the zone border but I was getting beat<br/>
up on so had to flee.  They eventually killed them both but because I was in<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s, I missed out on my first chance to get revenge on a festering hag.<br/>
Festering hags have killed me more than any other creature in Unrest and I<br/>
was looking forward to finally killing one.  The GDB we killed didn&#39;t drop a<br/>
bracelet and it was getting late so I camped without getting a bracelet.<br/>
Looking forward to trying again though:-)<br/>
