<br/>
others may be more the quests &quot;purists&quot;, and wanna actually loot all the<br/>
coins themselves.  But the bank guy just says to give him the coins, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t  ask how ya gott&#39;em.  I bought all six coins, most while auctioning<br/>
in FV.  I paid anywhere from 5pp to 50pp for each coin, and yep I prolly<br/>
over paid, but pp is a &quot;renewable resource&quot; anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Nostrolo&#39;s Tamborine is DEFINITELY better than a sharkskin drum.  Because of<br/>
Verant&#39;s slap shod work the sharkskin drum has the same graphic as a lute...<br/>
I found it confusing when twisting string and precussion songs.  Both<br/>
instruments looked exactly the same.<br/>
<br/>
So, start auctioning for coins, within a week or two, blammo!  You got your<br/>
drums!<br/>

&gt; Quick question, what lev i need to be to get the nostrolo drum (my bard is<br/>
&gt; 37)? or is it simpler to just go to kedge with a 52+ group and go find the<br/>
&gt; sharkskin drum? which of the 2 drums seems better (since i dont think i&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; ever get my hands on a selo&#39;s drum since the damn dragon patch)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Some guildmates were camping Phinigan for xp, kinda sad when his guards<br/>
&gt; wont even aggro when ya pull him... so i figure if they&#39;re going to kedge<br/>
&gt; for xp, i might as well hop along and hope to get a drum<br/>
&gt;<br/>
