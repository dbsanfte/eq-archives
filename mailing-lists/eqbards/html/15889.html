click on the DKPs link at the the top.  its been revised a few times in<br/>
recent months, but those are the current rules.<br/>
<br/>
just very recently, we have new rules for planar armor that we never had<br/>
before.  many new 46+ characters were reapoing up items that many very old<br/>
level 50 characters needed and who had put in so much more time.  so these<br/>
are new, i haven&#39;t even read them myself:<br/>

&gt; I was looking at these posts, and am very interested in this <br/>
&gt; point system.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any chance you could point me to the rules? =) </span></blockquote></div>
