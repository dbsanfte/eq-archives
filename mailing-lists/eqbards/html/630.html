&gt;Oh, another borderline exploit tactic with Bellow is kiting.<br/>
&gt;You know how druids can cast Spirit of the Wolf on themselves,<br/>
&gt;then Stinging Swarm (damage over time) on a monster, then just<br/>
&gt;run to stay out of melee range?  Bards can do the same thing<br/>
&gt;(though it&#39;s less effective and more work) with Accelerando<br/>
&gt;and Bellow.  I won&#39;t go into details (pretty easy to figure<br/>
&gt;out) since I try to avoid doing this.  I may start off a fight<br/>
&gt;using this tactic to soften up a monster (in that respect I<br/>
&gt;see it as similar to the root spell), or if I&#39;m fetching (so<br/>
&gt;other groups don&#39;t steal the monster), but I&#39;ve never mostly-<br/>
&gt;killed a monster doing this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember a bard on Fennin Ro in phase 4 beta who EXCLUSIVELY used this <br/>
tactic. He soloed until about level 20, and then when I tested him as a <br/>
group member...he SUCKED, no concept of teamwork, he didn&#39;t use any party <br/>
songs. All he ever used during fights was Bellow (he wouldn&#39;t use party <br/>
enhance songs). He also would also constantly train a tombstone mob after <br/>
him using the above tactic and sometimes get people killed.<br/>
<br/>
Mobs that will stop to kill the nearest player when chasing someone else <br/>
(like basically most undead, some crocs, etc...) he would trail into other <br/>
people. He got me killed once doing that with Lockjaw while I was trying to <br/>
heal my party.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, people playing bards in this manner need to get a clue.<br/>
