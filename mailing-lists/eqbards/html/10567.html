<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657204751">Heya everyone,<br/>
<br/>
ISP been down for a few days. =(<br/>
<br/>
I just had an idea while I was out on a cancer break (cough cough <br/>
wheeze)...I was thinking about the monsters they have in EQ, and how many of <br/>
them are (of course) taken from mythology or AD&D. Then I started <br/>
remeniscing (sp?) about back when I was a kid in 5th grade lookin through <br/>
the school library and I came across some mythology books (Greek, Norse, <br/>
etc). This is when I first started getting into fantasy literature.<br/>
<br/>
Well - I noticed that EQ doesn&#39;t have any satyrs (half-man, half goat) like <br/>
the greek god(?) Pan. I remembered the story about him seducing maidens with <br/>
his pan pipes/flute (whatever you want to call them), and thought it would <br/>
be neat if Verant were to add this to the game. Maybe a rare mob in Lesser <br/>
Fay or out on the Karanas. If you could kill him and get his pipes, you <br/>
could they would be useable as a wind instrument and give you +50 CHA! Just <br/>
kidding, a charisma bonus would be reasonable though for pixie strike and <br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea.<br/>
