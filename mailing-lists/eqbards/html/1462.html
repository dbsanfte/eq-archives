&gt; I am only level 10 at the moment but i had a question about the kiting<br/>
&gt; you guys were talking about. To kite a creature, you equip a drum, hit a<br/>
&gt; creature with a bellow, start selos, start running, bellow again, selo<br/>
&gt; again, below again...etc? Also, for only pulling a few creatures from a<br/>
&gt; bunch you said you were using the Lullaby. How does the lvl 8 Lament<br/>
&gt; song stack up to it? Is one more effective than the other? Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of your confusion is because people call the Lament song<br/>
Lull (because that&#39;s what it does), and people call the<br/>
Lullaby song Lull (because they&#39;re lazy and don&#39;t want to type<br/>
the whole thing).<br/>
<br/>
Lament is used to pull just the mobs you want from a group,<br/>
before they are aggressive to you.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby is used to put multiple mobs to sleep, after they are<br/>
already aggressive to you.<br/>
<br/>
And you don&#39;t have the kiting procedure down quite right, but<br/>
that&#39;s ok because anybody who uses the technique should figure<br/>
out on their own how to do it.  Try it and you will learn<br/>
rather quickly what does and doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
