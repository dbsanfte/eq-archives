<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t it wonderful!!! I felt the same way I started using the instrument<br/>
attack. My guild must have thought I was a raving lunatic (there are not a<br/>
whole lot of bards in my guild as main characters).<br/>

bard) and so is the person who plays her... hehehe - just FYI<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;DDD          CoD<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hymn         Melee Slot<br/>
&gt; &gt;Inventory    Inventory<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I switch out one of the inventory slots for another song instead -<br/>
especially if I&#39;m in a big/good group. But I do like your point about the<br/>
Largo&#39;s Binding - I will probably start weaving it in more often, especially<br/>
when in groups where I can use the instrument attack.<br/>
<br/>
However, (just FYI) here are a few reasons why I set mine up the way I<br/>
did... (the second and maybe the third one is probably only pertinent to<br/>
me):<br/>
<br/>
1) I use two inventory slots to have an extra one for my drum (especially<br/>
when soloing - I have selos in the next hotkey bank).<br/>
<br/>
2) I have a tendency to drop things when on the pointer (itchy trigger<br/>
finger I guess).... so I don&#39;t usually leave things on the pointer unless<br/>
I&#39;m actually back to where I pull the creature for the brass/lute<br/>
switching-song weaving, in which case I do leave the instruments on the<br/>
pointer for ease of switching.<br/>
<br/>
3) Also, I like the songs in bank 1, 2, and 3 because they are right next to<br/>
each other on the keyboard and I have small hands - easier to go from one<br/>
song to the next that way.<br/>
<br/>
As for never using another weapon, there are some cases where I have fought<br/>
where it was just too dangerous to use this song combination (Aviak City in<br/>
SK comes to mind) so I had to go back to the weapon/assist the puller/buff<br/>
the party deal... But that is fun too. It&#39;s just a whole lot of fun learning<br/>
different ways to fight different things, and nice to know that some of the<br/>
things I thought I couldn&#39;t fight alone, I CAN!... woohoo!!!!<br/>
