&gt; I&#39;ll also point out that stunning is why melee classes are so<br/>
&gt; screwed on the PvP server.  The game is designed so that<br/>
&gt; casting classes are balanced if the things they are fighting<br/>
&gt; can stun the caster frequently.  Aside from the few<br/>
&gt; classes/races which can bash, players cannot stun each other,<br/>
&gt; and so the melee classes become sitting ducks to the casters.<br/>

friend of mine decided to duel.  Suffice to say one on one we can easily<br/>
take on a Wizard, with the sleep song stunning them, and your dual wielded<br/>
weapons also interrupting them, it makes it nearly impossible for them to<br/>
cast.  However, Necros and Magicians are definitely a different story.<br/>
With there pets we would be hard pressed to win.<br/>
