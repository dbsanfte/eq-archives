 </span></blockquote>I carried my &quot;don&#39;t really care about experience&quot; attitude<br/>
into 31.  Died 3 times at 31, lost about 90% of a bubble each<br/>
time (except the time I got dropped to 30).  The third time it<br/>
dropped me to 2.5 bubbles.  That&#39;s when I realized if I&#39;d been<br/>
more careful, I would&#39;ve already been 32.  I now stress to all<br/>
my friends to play it safe at hell levels + 1.  It is better<br/>
to let two of your friends die than to let yourself die if<br/>
you&#39;re in a HL+1.  It is just not worth dying in them and your<br/>
#1 priority should be getting out of them ASAP.<br/>
