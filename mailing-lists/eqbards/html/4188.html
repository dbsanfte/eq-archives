&gt; &gt;     I was fighting spiders in E. Karana a while back and got &#39;Halfling<br/>
&gt; &gt;     parts&quot; as loot. (eeuuww) Twice.  Quite a shock.  I think it was salted<br/>
&gt; &gt;     by someone with a wicked sense of humor but I&#39;m not 100 percent sure.<br/>
&gt; &gt;     It is conceivable that a giant spider would have Halfling parts<br/>
&gt; &gt;     (Samwise, where is Frodo anyway...) but I haven&#39;t seen this extreme<br/>
&gt; &gt;     level of humor before from variant.  Anyone else have a similar<br/>
&gt; &gt;     experience?<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s what I&#39;ve gotten from them.  Someone at Verant just has<br/>
&gt; a grisly sense of humor<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spiders often have halfling parts.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a reference to The<br/>
Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, both of which had spiders who enjoyed eating<br/>
halflings (or trying to in any case).<br/>
