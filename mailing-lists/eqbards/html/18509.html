<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141387294">True and I haven&#39;t dealt with them on a high level zone scale (my<br/>
highest char being 23).  But it seems the other big guilds don&#39;t  have<br/>
much of a problem with FOH, and they seemed to have come up with a<br/>
pretty good system of sharing it.<br/>
<br/>
From what i know, guild XXXX lets FOH know they want to kill yyyyyy (or<br/>
invade plane zzzzz), FOH gives them 24 hours (after it spawns) to do it,<br/>
if not they go in and do it.  It sounds pretty reasonable to me as they<br/>
reall have enough firepower to easily do both dragons after a respawn,<br/>
before any other guild gets organized enough to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Some guild got angry the FOH wouldn&#39;t share their techniques for<br/>
breaking the planes or killing the dragons easily (when these things<br/>
weren&#39;t commonly known), but I don&#39;t have a problem with that.  I think<br/>
they have a right to keep those &quot;secrets&quot; to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Veeshan is a weird server, it has a VERY high percentage of Japanese<br/>
players, so that always makes things a little testy (since there is<br/>
basically no communication).  Population wise (especially pre-split) it<br/>
was truly bizarre.  Veeshan would be 20% more crowded than any server in<br/>
the middle of night, early morning (Eastern time), but in prime time<br/>
(Easterern still) it would be around average.<br/>

&gt; we get the same thing on our server, as i am sure every &quot;uber-guild&quot; (stupid<br/>
&gt; term) does on their respective servers.  i don&#39;t think anyone is quite as<br/>
&gt; large or has quite the attitude that FoH apparently does though.  i think<br/>
&gt; they have 300 or so members, so they can really take over a large portion of<br/>
&gt; the high level game from other players.  we have about 65 members or so, and<br/>
&gt; we can do dragons and planes at our leisure as well, but we work very well<br/>
&gt; with the other guilds on the server capable of doing these.  i don&#39;t believe<br/>
&gt; that is the case with FoH.  i have no first-hand experience but from what i<br/>
&gt; hear they deserve their rep, but i guess only those who have dealt with them<br/>
&gt; personally can know.<br/>

&gt; ok bragging time, we killed Venril Sathir first =b<br/>
