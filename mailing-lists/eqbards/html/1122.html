<div id="ygrps-yiv-827619991">Greetings all!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;_Bard_, by MORGAN Llywelyn, is a historical novel about the coming of the<br/>
&gt;Irish to Ireland, with a bard as the central character.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bard is an excellent book, I would agree here.<br/>
<br/>
Two other good readings:<br/>
<br/>
Taliesin (and others in the series) by Stephen Lawhead. Kind of a different<br/>
twist on the Arthurian legends, it focuses on Taliesin and the early<br/>
history of the family that eventually produced Merlin. Lawhead also<br/>
emphasizes Merlin&#39;s role as a bard, too, which is somewhat interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Dragonriders of Pern books by Anne McCafferey are tremendously<br/>
wonderful in their use of the &#39;harper&#39; a bard-like entity in her fictious<br/>
world. One of the more recent novels in the series Masterharper of Pern<br/>
really focuses on a legendary bard of the Pernish world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for guilds, let me take the opportunity to shamelessly plug The<br/>
Soerbaird, a guild of bards I founded a few months back to do exactly what<br/>
the traditional bard did. We do a lot of composing and recording, acting as<br/>
both entertainer and historian. We&#39;re also gaining some influence in<br/>
certain circles, and hope to play important roles in the developing lands<br/>
of Norrah as mediators and messengers as well.<br/>
