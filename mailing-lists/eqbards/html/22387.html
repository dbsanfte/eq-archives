<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089441465">I&#39;ll switch instruments occasionally, but only between two different ones,<br/>
generally Lute and Drum right now.  I can&#39;t imagine switching weapons and<br/>
instruments, that is totally whacked.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Twisting Questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt whose main is a bard<br/>
(an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and there... &quot;less<br/>
talking more twisting!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three to four songs<br/>
but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.  <br/>
 <br/>
Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>
question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>
 <br/>
I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory slots, and #2 bank<br/>
set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, switch to #1, switch<br/>
out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new song without<br/>
missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one of those things<br/>
that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to switch hotkey<br/>
banks...<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, btw, play with people 8 levels lower than you!  I played with a monk my<br/>
level and a warrior 8 levels higher.  He went through 40 in the same amount<br/>
of time it took us to go through 34 (about 3.5 hours).  Sick.<br/>
