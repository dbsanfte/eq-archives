<div id="ygrps-yiv-110715591">I will not repeat this particular message.  I would remind folks to re read the list FAQ.  There is ZERO excuse to get down into personal attacks, and even less for the language used.  This is after all a bard list if you feel you MUST insult someone at least use a bit of wit.  This should be a &quot;family&quot; oriented list.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the comments about someone raising to level 12 and complaining about being underpowered.  I&#39;ve actually seen complaints from just about all levels, folks have different views. There are serious concerns about being a primary melee class unable to really melee well, there are issues of being a caster but being unable to do more then minimal damage to a large area thereby drawing more attention.  As most of us have said and know, being in a good group reading this list and practicing cancels many of our weaknesses out.  But they do remain issues try and respect that.<br/>
