<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748616982">I&#39;m pretty sure no one else&#39;s reason will be similar to mine ;o)~<br/>
<br/>
Back in NWN, my character&#39;s name (my first online game, btw) was NOR Bard<br/>
(NOR for New OutRiders, and the name was simply Bard).  I came upon the name<br/>
because the way the game was set up, there were very narrow paths to go from<br/>
one place to another.  If you got into a fight on that path, sometimes folks<br/>
couldn&#39;t go around, and had to wait til you got done.  To keep the gathering<br/>
masses occupied, I would sing naughty little limricks *eg*, ergo the name<br/>
Bard seemed appropriate when I joined NOR and needed to pick a more<br/>
RPG-worthy name (MR.Bill1711 just didn&#39;t cut it, also there was no bard<br/>
class in any online game at that time... all 2 of them heh!)<br/>
<br/>
After being in NOR for a number of years, the name stuck with me like an<br/>
alter ego, so when NWN fell, and EQ finally started Beta, the name was a<br/>
natural choice (damned name filter made me pick Barrd though :o/ ).  Because<br/>
of my naughty musical proclivities (I also wrote bawdy lil tunes for our<br/>
boards between NWN and EQ), folks just naturally assumed I would be a bard.<br/>
<br/>
Suprisingly enough, I was VERY hesitant to be a bard as it was a complete<br/>
unknown to me (up to this point, all the games I had played were turn-based<br/>
combat, except UO, and I really didn&#39;t understand it&#39;s skill system... just<br/>
give me the old AD&D system any day :op ).  Once I learned that I was the<br/>
ony magic-using class in Norrath that didn&#39;t have to worry about mana usage,<br/>
I knew this was the class for me ;o)  Ever since that first burst of Selo&#39;s,<br/>
I have been hooked.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Why did you start a Bard?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the Bardic class.<br/>
When I first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always<br/>
find their corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and<br/>
could run faster then others....that got me to start playing the Bard, and<br/>
I&#39;ve been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so<br/>
flexible once you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
