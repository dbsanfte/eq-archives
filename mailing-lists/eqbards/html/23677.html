<div id="ygrps-yiv-204048961">Heh, I love Karnors stories, here&#39;s one:<br/>
 <br/>
Skeleton tower, full group, 2 bards...Troll Shadownight MT/puller.<br/>
 <br/>
Half hour into the pickup group (everything is going great mind you) the<br/>
troll shout for me to come over and fight the mob they are working on<br/>
(insinuating that I am being useless), I say, &quot;I am...&quot; (I&#39;m holding the<br/>
Tambourine and twisting the 3 chant DOT&#39;s while punching because the other<br/>
bard is buffing) and he says, &quot;but you&#39;re not doing any damage!&quot;, to which I<br/>
respond, &quot;hehe, sure I am, I&#39;m doing 300 damage every 3 ticks :-)&quot; -silence-<br/>
 <br/>
He must have had at least the tiniest bit of curiosity regarding why the<br/>
sissy bard with the tambourine kept aggroing the mobs and taunting them off<br/>
him half way through nearly every battle by punching for 11 damage with his<br/>
mighty green fists.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I get pissed but mostly I just try to laugh it off and keep<br/>
moving, you never expect to have to educate people in their 50&#39;s but it<br/>
happens a lot, even to me occasionally ;-)<br/>

I feel your pain...  When I get very frustrated at players like that I often<br/>
say &quot;I don&#39;t tell you how to play you&#39;re your character, please don&#39;t tell<br/>
me how to play mine.  What I find so frustrating; with very few exceptions I<br/>
never see people telling any other classes how to play their character<br/>
except bards.<br/>

hehe, thats nothing, this morning in karnors we were at moat.  We had a<br/>
chanter, cleric, wizard, paladin and yes... 2 bards.   At least 4 times the<br/>
damn paladin kept telling us to just sing mana during fights.  Me and the<br/>
other bard were practically crying at the ignorance. Other bard was doing<br/>
lev 50 haste, nivs and clarity, and i was before he starting crying, doing<br/>
chant of battle, hymn of restoration and clarity... and yet kept hearing<br/>
play mana play mana.  Maybe if he let the full mana cleric/chanter stun<br/>
instead of him chain stunning we wouldnt of had that issue now would we.<br/>
