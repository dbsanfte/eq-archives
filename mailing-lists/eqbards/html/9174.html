<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211869865">With what you are saying then isn&#39;t this a problem for us bards also!<br/>
Either it be &quot;bard hate&quot; or this, we have a problem.  I think that they<br/>
should give us more defense skills to help us out with all of this &quot;bard<br/>
hate&quot; or bad axis problem.  I am thinking of parry up to skill like 150~200<br/>
and dodge increase to like 175~200.  This will decrease the frustration with<br/>
having non-engage MOB coming after us just because we are singing our song.<br/>
This IMO is the most annoying thing of being a bard.  Even when you use<br/>
assist on your group the mob still come after you and most people do not<br/>
understand how much the MOB hate us that they complains that we are not<br/>
using the assist function.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were playing any song at all (even Selos is a buff), then the<br/>
monster put you on his hate list.  If the other group was fighting multiple<br/>
mobs and only dealing damage to one (as they probably should), then the<br/>
other mob could easily be pulled off by your song.  Once the mob jumped<br/>
you, you started playing your songs the best you know how.  Anthem or Heal<br/>
or whatever song you play is not only pulsing on you, but also on every PC<br/>
around you.  While your songs don&#39;t affect PCs not in your group, they<br/>
still put you on the hate list for the mob (and faction adjustments).  If<br/>
you are surrounded by your group and the other group, the mob sees you<br/>
buffing 12 PCs.  Nothing will get the mob off you as long as you keep<br/>
playing your songs like this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there are also other factors that can make you believe in &quot;bard hate&quot;.<br/>
Zones are buggy.  Songs can go through walls, unlimited z-axis, and<br/>
sometimes all the way to the other side of the zone.  And many zones have<br/>
pathing problems.  You may be affecting mobs and not even know it.  Five<br/>
minutes later, the mob may have finally found a way to you.  It will run<br/>
past other people who are not on it&#39;s hate list until it gets to you.  You<br/>
might not have even been playing your songs for several minutes.  Of course<br/>
you will think that it is Bard Hate, but there is no such thing.<br/>
<br/>
It is a bard&#39;s song that cause monsters to attack, not just being a bard.<br/>
