<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665018138">What, John made a mathematical error?  I am flabbergasted!  Its actually<br/>
safer than 1.414x by a long shot so long as you are 1.414x melee range from<br/>
them when you turn.  They follow an arc inside the corner as you turn it,<br/>
not being smart enough to lead you and get the advantage of the triangle.<br/>
The length of the arc inside the corner depends totally on the distance they<br/>
are from you when you turn.  at 1.414x melee range they will catch you, if<br/>
you&#39;ve cleared more distance than that already you can turn safely at slower<br/>
speeds as the length of the arc they travel is not constant with respect to<br/>
the distance you travel.  Your traveled distance is 2X where X is the<br/>
distance they are from you when you turn.  Their covered distance will be<br/>
.5{Pi} times X, or 1.55 times X.  Hence if you are moving more than 1.3<br/>
(approx.) times them they will not catch you.  Hopefully I haven&#39;t forgotten<br/>
some Geometry here, but as I recall this should be true.  Now if they were<br/>
smart enough to lead us as we turn, yikes!<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that if you skirt close to trees the Mob&#39;s will be slowed by<br/>
the trees as they run into them but you will not be.  This allows one to<br/>
outrun some Mob&#39;s without using accellerando in heavily forested areas if<br/>
the MOB is close to your speed (like orcs).  I call this scraping the tail<br/>
off on a tree.  Of course one miscalculation where you run into the tree and<br/>
they are on top of you.<br/>

&gt; It has become apparent in reviewing the last couple of posts in this<br/>
thread<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m either not coordinated enough to pull this off or I just need<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; practice.  I&#39;ll try and hit the Orc Cents again and give it another go,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; hell, if I can&#39;t even finish off two Orcs without losing half a bubble of<br/>
&gt; health, how am I going to fare with Froon and Choon?<br/>

Top priority is keeping Accelerando up and staying out of<br/>
melee range.  Remember, you can try to charm them any time you<br/>
want, but you can&#39;t run away from them if Accelerando drops.  <br/>
I usually keep my drum equipped when doing this just for the<br/>
added safety margin.  (Technically, the magic number is 1.414x<br/>
normal running speed.  If you can exceed this speed, you can<br/>
make a 90 degree turn while they&#39;re chasing you and they still<br/>
won&#39;t be able to catch you.)  I&#39;ve switched to a lute to heal<br/>
up maybe 4 or 5 times, but 2 of those attempts have resulted<br/>
in me dying.  If you have to heal up, chances are you&#39;re just<br/>
a couple hits away from the point where you start moving<br/>
slower, and having a lute equipped then will result in your<br/>
death even with Accel.<br/>
<br/>
What I normally do is get them to chase me, run backwards (at<br/>
my level with a MM drum, I run much faster backwards than they<br/>
can run forward), and wait for a &quot;your feet move faster&quot;<br/>
message.  When I get that message I know Accel has just been<br/>
refreshed and I hit charm.  Regardless of whether or not the<br/>
charm works, I immediately start Accel again.  If the charm<br/>
worked, then I give the attack command (if needed).  If it<br/>
didn&#39;t work, I run away some more and Accel should refresh<br/>
before it drops.  There&#39;s enough time to charm twice before<br/>
you hit Accel again, but I found myself getting hit with that<br/>
&quot;your feet move faster/you slow down&quot; bug too often when<br/>
trying that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found /pet guard here to be more useful than /pet sit<br/>
down.  A pet that&#39;s sitting will get up and follow you if you<br/>
move too far away (or it decides on its own that it&#39;d rather<br/>
go somewhere else).  If you tell it to guard here, it&#39;ll stay<br/>
glued there giving you not just the duration of the charm to<br/>
get away, but the time it takes the mob to close the distance<br/>
with you.<br/>
