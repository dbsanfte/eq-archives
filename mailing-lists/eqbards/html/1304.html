<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123258074"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Maybe we could suggest Verant replace one of the &quot;useless&quot;<br/>
&gt; songs (e.g. Charisma or Identify)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last night I was checking prices on plate mail, and decided to mem up the charisma<br/>
song just to see if it made even a 1cp difference in prices. I used my mino horn<br/>
and targeted the indifferent shopkeeper. Low and behold, he con&#39;d amiable after<br/>
the song took affect. Not only did he con amiable, but so did every other<br/>
shopkeeper in east Freeport.The price of the chest plate remained at 794pp though<br/>
with my 90 charisma. (I think prices can only go so low).<br/>
Afterwards I decided to go into west Freeport and try it out some more. I went<br/>
around considering different shopkeepers, all who were indifferent. I then used<br/>
the song on ONE shopkeeper, and she became amiable along with the rest of them.<br/>
I then used it on a Freeport Militia guard (they all con apprehensive to me), and<br/>
then they all became amiable as well.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this song was just recently fixed or what. Perhaps its related to<br/>
your wind instrument skill. I&#39;m lvl 27 now so perhaps a high wind skill is<br/>
required for it to make a noticable difference.<br/>
The affects of the song are not permenant. The duration of the affects seem to be<br/>
random.<br/>
So no, you cant use this song on the Dark Elf guards, then expect to walk freely<br/>
thru Neriak for a half hour. On the other hand (if you dont have invis yet), use<br/>
it on a Dark Elf guard and run thru Nektulos on your way to Lavastorm without them<br/>
attacking you. Thats just an example. I&#39;m sure there are many other uses yet to be<br/>
discovered.<br/>
Say you die inside the house of Unrest and you need to get your corpse. Perhaps<br/>
you can target a skel or whatever, use the song on it and then the entire<br/>
UnrestInhabitants faction will be amiable to you for a few minutes? Enough time to<br/>
/corpse your corpse to safety and wont  have to worry about getting someone to<br/>
cast invis + invis vs undead on you.<br/>
Just an idea, but I havent actually tested these things yet.<br/>
I suggest you all experiment with this a bit.<br/>
