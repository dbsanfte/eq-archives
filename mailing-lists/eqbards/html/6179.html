<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798005331">Has anyone here done the Langseax quest?  Last night, I did this quest, to<br/>
obtain one of the lovely Langseax swords for my warrior pal.  For those of<br/>
you who don&#39;t know the quest, it&#39;s an upper 20s type of quest, and though<br/>
not particularly hard, it&#39;s certainly time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
I did all the parts to the quest, obtained the final item (the murderer&#39;s<br/>
head), carefully sang my carrillon at the guy (who then regarded me<br/>
amiably), and gave him the head.  To which he said, &quot;Although the wolves of<br/>
the north bear you no ill will... blah blah blah NO SWORD FOR YOU!&quot;   (Okay,<br/>
that wasn&#39;t the exact dialog, but you get the idea).<br/>
<br/>
Is it a warrior only quest or something?  It didn&#39;t seem to be.  Anyone else<br/>
had any experience with it?<br/>
