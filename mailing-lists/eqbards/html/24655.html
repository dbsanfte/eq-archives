<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-594864564">Glad to hear that the &quot;Downgraded&quot; weapon gets passed down.  That&#39;s very<br/>
rare and almost every situation I&#39;ve seen is that when you win a lotto it&#39;s<br/>
your property forever to do with what you want.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you are in a great guilds where people work together for the<br/>
common good.  Your lucky - that&#39;s not very common (especially from what I&#39;ve<br/>
seen on Xegony).<br/>
<br/>
My only concern is the number of instances I&#39;ve seen (and allusions on<br/>
Backstage and here) of the mentality that the bard never gets any.  I&#39;ve<br/>
heard (first hand) of pickup raids where after the fact it was stated bards<br/>
were ineligible for haste item - and universal acceptance of that.<br/>
<br/>
Priority to Warriors for weapons is fine as long as it isn&#39;t a perpetuating<br/>
thing where Bards NEVER get a chance for a good item.<br/>
<br/>
And once again - maybe it&#39;s different for you - but I&#39;m often in groups<br/>
where there is only bards and rangers meleeing - given that a Ranger&#39;s melee<br/>
skill is pretty much equal to a Bards - I&#39;d argue that shows the Bard and<br/>
Ranger has as much &quot;Need&quot; as the warrior for the good weapon.  One of the<br/>
reason I&#39;m meleeing is to keep that Enchanter from getting hit for<br/>
example...<br/>
<br/>
Once again - I&#39;m not criticizing Elfson and his guild for what clearly works<br/>
for them - just pointing out that IMHO - it&#39;s and exception not the rule.<br/>
And I&#39;ve seen too many cases where bards and simply screwed out of things<br/>
they can justify a need for as much as anyone else.<br/>

I said in my example that when the warrior got the crscent blade, I was<br/>
given his lammy,  Of course we discovered I can&#39;t wield it, so it went on to<br/>
another member.  To be honest I don&#39;t think I should have been given the<br/>
lammy in any case.  I currently wield Sinoche&#39;s Partisan and Trolloch&#39;s<br/>
Skien (10/25 5pois, procs a poison based whirl type stun, off hand only).<br/>
The Lamentation is equal to the Partisan, and worth 2-3x as much.  And<br/>
certainly worth more than an off hand weapon for a class that doesnt melee<br/>
all the time and doesn&#39;t get double attack.<br/>
<br/>
Getting warriors weapons should be a top priority of a guild.  Warriors are<br/>
critical for many raids, they tend to live the longest and need to have<br/>
every oppurtunity to keep the mob taunted on them.  Behind them fall in all<br/>
the other melees, then behind that gaggle bards.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I don&#39;t understand<br/>
why bards get upset when weapons are awarded to other classes first...<br/>
