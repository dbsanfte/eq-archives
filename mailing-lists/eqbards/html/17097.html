<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743088938">heh, If I had been planning for it I would have had CoD loaded as well :) It<br/>
is something that just happened. The wiz called for the group to zone, but I<br/>
said no and shouted for the healing support.  I was the highest level in the<br/>
group, the rest were 42-45.  Yes it was nerve-wracking, but it sure was a<br/>
rush :)  Speaking of nerve-wracking I heard a group on our server broke<br/>
Efreeti with 4 people recently, sound like something I would like to try one<br/>
day.<br/>

&gt; Really?  The other night in at nox area in Sol B we had a bad pull coupled<br/>
&gt; with a respawn and ended up with 5 sonic bats.  I shouted for the cleric<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; druid to keep me healed and went with Niv&#39;s + Hymn + CoC.  It was as long<br/>
&gt; fight but we won.  Every single person in the group was amazed that we did<br/>
&gt; not have to zone and lost no members.  Never underestimate your power as a<br/>
&gt; Bard ;)<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t go about making this tactic common practice, unless<br/>
you&#39;re also grouped with an enchanter (AE stun) and<br/>
wizard/mage (AE nuke/rain).  Yes you can do it with just<br/>
healers, but boy is it nervewracking (may be easier with bugs<br/>
and bats, but frogs tended to attack the healers after a bit).<br/>
