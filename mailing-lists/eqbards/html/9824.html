&gt; A 30th level necro friend of mine (Hi, Evanya!) has started a bard based in<br/>

&gt; Cyricc, the new bard, was asking questions about our skills when confronted<br/>
&gt; with leveling up to 10th.  I put it thusly: &quot;Bards have very many of the<br/>
&gt; skills that other specialize in.  Since we have skills from all other<br/>
&gt; classes it is only just and fair that we either get the skill later<br/>
&gt; (Clarity: Enchanter 29th, Bard 32nd) or that it isn&#39;t quite as strong or<br/>
&gt; quite as useful (Forage, Safe Fall, Charm, Melee)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just FYI, Clarity was originally a bard-only ability.  It was<br/>
given to enchanters back when they were widely regarded a<br/>
broken class.  I&#39;d consider it a slap in the face that they<br/>
get it before we do, if not for the fact that it stacks with<br/>
bard Clarity and thus has only a positive effect on the<br/>
players (aside from bards being slightly less desired in<br/>
groups).<br/>

For the most part I agree with you that we don&#39;t *need* these<br/>
skills to cap higher.  However, a lot of the early portion of<br/>
the game is spent in pointless button mashing to work up a<br/>
skill to where it&#39;s considered &quot;usable&quot; by most players.  Our<br/>
skill caps in many cases fall below that point.  e.g. Rogues<br/>
love to hit hide when a train is coming because they&#39;re<br/>
virtually guaranteed that it&#39;ll work.  OTOH, bards are<br/>
virtually guaranteed that it won&#39;t work so they don&#39;t bother<br/>
trying.  I&#39;d like to see it succeed often enough to make it<br/>
worthwhile to at least try it.<br/>
<br/>
The attack speedups of Anthem/Celerity/Verses behind halved is<br/>
another gripe.  Halving Anthem I don&#39;t have much problem with.  <br/>
Around that level (16), the enchanter&#39;s Quickness speeds you<br/>
up by 20% and takes 80 mana.  A L16 enchanter (say 120 int)<br/>
would have to use virtually all his mana to cast Quickness on<br/>
5 other party members; the bard&#39;s Anthem was doing the same<br/>
thing.  So it made sense to halve it.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that this doesn&#39;t really scale.  They recently<br/>
halved the speed of Verses of Victory (L50 song), and from<br/>
reports I&#39;m seeing it&#39;s gone from a 45% speedup (same as<br/>
enchanter&#39;s L49 Swift) to about a 23% speedup.  A typical L50<br/>
enchanter (say 170 int) will use a bit more than half his mana<br/>
to cast Swift like the Wind (250 mana) on 5 party members,<br/>
plus has Clarity to help him recover from it faster.  The<br/>
situation was nowhere near as unbalanced as it was with the<br/>
Anthem/Quickness comparison.  In fact, a L50 enchanter could<br/>
cast Alacrity (25% speedup, 115 mana) on 5 party members for<br/>
about a bubble and half of mana, and that would be *faster*<br/>
than our nerfed Verses.<br/>
<br/>
Granted Verses does have stat buffs as well, but I think it&#39;s<br/>
clear the imbalance was not as bad as with Anthem.  Verant<br/>
just took the methodology they used to balance things at L16,<br/>
and applied it to L50.  They probably should&#39;ve reduced our<br/>
speedups by a flat amount (say 10%) across the board.  But<br/>
because they halved it, you get the ridiculous situation where<br/>
a L24 spell is faster than our L50 song.  Also, if this had<br/>
been like Clarity and the effects stacked, then I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have a problem with it.  But because they don&#39;t stack, it in<br/>
effect takes away from what we have to offer to a group if an<br/>
enchanter is present.<br/>
