&gt;Ok, we&#39;re wandering again (and I&#39;ve been one of the worst offenders).  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;alway pointed out to people that bard kiting requires the mob to be in<br/>
&gt;bellow<br/>
&gt;range, and that is short enough to  A.  Keep it from dumping on somebody,<br/>
&gt;and B.  be a decent bit of risk.  Still tedious as anything though :)<br/>

&gt;I just dumped EQ_shamans because the whining over there was irking<br/>
&gt;me so much that my aggravation spilled over here.  My fault, sorry.<br/>

&gt;On bard related issues, if they did the same thing you suggest to our damage<br/>

Chords (or Denon&#39;s) is a primary song, perhaps we need to re-examine your<br/>
methods.  Both Chords and Denon&#39;s should be wonderful for white/black and<br/>
below, and somewhat useful vs. yellow.  But to allow one song to equally<br/>
effect multiple reds is a tad ... overkill.<br/>
