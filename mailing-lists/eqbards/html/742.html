The level two song Chords of Dissonance is NOT a buff song, it&#39;s an Area of<br/>
Effect DAMAGE song.  The guards attacked you because you attacked THEM.<br/>
<br/>
Diety has a strong bearing on a lot of factions, though choosing one of the<br/>
good gods doesn&#39;t hurt you much with followers of other good gods.  Karana<br/>
worshipers and Marr worshipers get along just fine, for instance.<br/>

&gt;  For those quick browsers of messages, here is my warning.  I used the<br/>
first<br/>
&gt;level attack song alternating it mainly with the level 2 buff song when<br/>
fighting<br/>
&gt;in and around my home town of Kelethin.  Occasionally, when I run back to<br/>
town<br/>
&gt;(NEVER still singing my attack song), a guard will kill me for no apparent<br/>
&gt;reason.  Maybe it thinks I attacked another PC if he or she happened to run<br/>
by,<br/>
&gt;but I really don&#39;t know.  I fear that I have lost faction with my town,<br/>
though I<br/>
&gt;receive no messages about it.  Shopkeepers now look at me apprehensively,<br/>
except<br/>
&gt;for my guild of course.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Anyway, on to my question.  How much does a diety effect your actual<br/>
abilities<br/>
&gt;and inter-race relations?  I play a Wood Elf bard, and have enjoyed it<br/>
immensly,<br/>
&gt;but chose my diety as Tunare for fear of fraction problems.  I roleplay my<br/>
&gt;character as a romantic, so naturally Erolisi Marr (sp?) seems like a good<br/>
&gt;choice, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effects on others.  Would love to hear from<br/>
&gt;another bard who has tried more than one diety perhaps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Laeaus, Wood Elf Bard level...(sigh)...3<br/>
