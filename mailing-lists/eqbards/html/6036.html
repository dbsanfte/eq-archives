&gt;&quot;you have to learn to stop hitting them and let them beat on the others&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;you have to learn to scrape them onto the real tanks&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, These are inane, it is NOT the bards job to extricate him or herself,<br/>
for one simple reason YOU CAN&#39;T. A same level warrior cannot taunt anything<br/>
off me, not ever. Stopping hitting them does absolutly zip when you are<br/>
singing a debuff like chains or dennons or god forbid you have lulled them.<br/>
They will hit you, there is no point in not hitting back.<br/>
I am in the near perfect group as I have said before. Warrior (3 levels<br/>
higher), Cleric, Wizard and me the bard.  The cleric keeps me healed, the<br/>
warrior taunts them off me. But saying I shouldn&#39;t be in there wacking is<br/>
inane. I can do real damage and so I should be. Tell them to give it up. If<br/>
they can&#39;t keep you alive it is THEIR shortcoming not yours. My group would<br/>
really feel it was their fault if I died. THen again, they are good enough<br/>
that I haven&#39;t died once while hunting with them. *smiles*<br/>

sing lull while I have it then switch in the pause :o)<br/>
