<div id="ygrps-yiv-832840788"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Castle 1st floor: Unknown (high 30s/low 40s)<br/>
&gt; Castle 2d floor: Unknown (low 40s)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You&#39;d be hard pressed to hold the castle with those two groups.<br/>
  I wouldnt even allow high 30s in the castle, but that&#39;s just<br/>
  my own take on it.  It would take at least 3 groups of L50s<br/>
  to completely contain the spawn from the castle I would guess.<br/>
  Conversely, 4-5 groups of low-mid L40s could pull it off I&#39;m<br/>
  thinking.  Due to poor pathing in Mistmoore, usually (even<br/>
  with harmony tactics) you pull one, you pull them all.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, estimating on the safe side.</div>
