<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-858453959">There are 4 spawns in the internal area where the LE spawns. 4 clockworks<br/>
and a wanderer. The wanderer has a roughly 20% chance of being the LE. The<br/>
LE himself has a real nasty damage shield (worse than the efreeti) so I<br/>
highly recommend that your shaman cancel magic on him until the shield is<br/>
gone. (it&#39;s unlikely that the druid will be able to get the cancel magic to<br/>
stick given the level disparity) The LE is about level 38, so don&#39;t expect<br/>
to get much to stick on him. Focus on party buffs. (psalm, anthem, hymn)<br/>
<br/>
Clockworks come in several varieties. They are all named &quot;CWG Model xx&quot;<br/>
where the last two letters indicate the level range and the ability of the<br/>
clockwork.<br/>
<br/>
The first letter is level:<br/>
==========================<br/>
C is the easiest, usually level 28-30.<br/>
M is the medium, 30-32.<br/>
X is the hardest, 32-34.<br/>
<br/>
The second is the special ability:<br/>
==================================<br/>
A is a regular warrior, no special abilities.<br/>
B has a force module, which knocks you way back when you get hit.<br/>
C has a frost module, which procs a weak cold based dd spell when it hits<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
The gnome owners of the clockworks come in several flavors as well:<br/>
===================================================================<br/>
- Miners are typical warrior mobs, ranging from level 29-33 or so. They seem<br/>
to have low str and ac, making them pretty easy kills for their level.<br/>
- Curators are cleric monsters, ranging from 30-33 or so (I have yet to see<br/>
one cast Superior Heal). They aren&#39;t too difficult, but annoying because<br/>
they are clerics. Even if you are amiable, they will heal any gnomes you are<br/>
fighting, although they won&#39;t actually join the fight.<br/>
- Conjurers are magician monsters. This means they almost always have a pet<br/>
and a damage hield. If you plan to melee them, make sure you bring something<br/>
to dispel their damage hield. They also nuke a little hard. And they have an<br/>
annoying habit of damage shielding any gnomes that are near them or pass by<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Also be warned that gnomes and their clockworks can see through bard invis.<br/>
(as can goblin shamans and wizzies)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a gnome killer so I can&#39;t give you much info on resist rates and<br/>
such, but I do know that clockworks hit hard. I would definitely let the SK<br/>
pull. I think you&#39;ll get beat on a lot if you pull. I also think that the<br/>
odds of landing lull are low given that most things will be yellow or red.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Solusek Eye and the Lava Elemental<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings I am in need of some bardic tactics and advice.<br/>
<br/>
Some friends and I want to take on the Lava Elemental in Solusek Eye. Can<br/>
anyone give me any advice<br/>
on how best to approach this mob and his surrounding friends? I know there<br/>
are 4 CWG&#39;s around and<br/>
either a 5th wanderer or the Lava Elemental. But I have seen nothing on the<br/>
web of how to approach<br/>
him. And few people I have spoken with seem to know.<br/>
<br/>
The group will be:<br/>
<br/>
Bard (me) Level 29 or 30, depending how much I get to play, but lately the<br/>
Steel Golem area in Cazic<br/>
has been a level every 4-5 hours. :-)..<br/>
Troll Shaman Level 41 and Pet.<br/>
Troll SK Level 40<br/>
Ogre Warrior Level 34<br/>
Hafling Druid Level 31.<br/>
Maybe another Cleric if they can make it. Only level 26 though or anyone<br/>
else we can pick up.<br/>
<br/>
Questions I have:<br/>
<br/>
1. Can I lull pull to get 1 or 2 at a time? I have never killed a CWG or a<br/>
gnome but the evils have.<br/>
2. Will I be able to stun the mobs or do I need another couple of levels?<br/>
3. I know the CWG&#39;s are very resistant to Magic and mostly melee but can<br/>
they be charmed?<br/>
4. Can this group take and hold the room?<br/>
5. Any other advice? My spell selection will probably be Psalm, Hym, Charm,<br/>
Pixie, Anthem or Chant,<br/>
Lullaby, Lull, and Group invis.<br/>
<br/>
If you would rather send it to my home email feel free as I am asking for<br/>
some spoiler advice.<br/>
