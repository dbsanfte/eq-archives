<div id="ygrps-yiv-83708023">I use four banks.<br/>
<br/>
Bank one, the default when you log in, has 1 Hide, 2 Sneak, 3 Selos, 4 Hymn,<br/>
5 Clarity, and 6 Run.<br/>
<br/>
Bank two has my inventory slots, so I can quickly switch from weapon to<br/>
instrument, as well as Hymn, since often when I switch to lute, it&#39;s to<br/>
heal.  Handy to have it right there.<br/>
<br/>
Bank three is my combat bank, it&#39;s full up with songs, with certain mainstay<br/>
songs always in the same slot, and others moved around to fit the situation.<br/>
In most cases its my Combat song as 1 (that varies now, as I twiddle between<br/>
Anthem, Celerity, and Berzerker), 2 is usually an Area slow down song<br/>
(Melodic binding for a long while, now it&#39;s Chords of Cessation.)  3 is<br/>
ALWAYS Selos, 4 is always Consonant Chain, 5 is always Bellow, and 6 varies,<br/>
usually between Screech and Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
Bank Four is a utility bank,  I have Hide again, Tracking, Forage, Assist,<br/>
Bind Wounds, and Selos.  Matter of fact, Selos is on the 3 slot on all six<br/>
banks.  I don&#39;t have Sense Heading hotboxed, with this much time in the<br/>
game, I&#39;m never lost.<br/>
<br/>
I find it&#39;s MUCH MUCH MUCH quicker to have songs hotkeyed than it is<br/>
tracking a mouse all over the screen, and since I play at 1024 resolution<br/>
and full screen, that&#39;s a lot of mouse moving.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a snap to hit SHIFT # to move from bank to bank, and after all this<br/>
time, it&#39;s second nature.  I find myself hitting 6, then 3 first thing when<br/>
I log in(run and Selos), SHIFT 3 to move right to the combat songs, SHIFT 2<br/>
to twiddle inventory, SHIFT 4 then 2 to catch a quick Tracking, SHIFT 1 then<br/>
5 to fire up Clarity for the casters, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I rarely if ever mouselook in the game.   I prefer to have my hands on<br/>
the keyboard as much as possible.  I know there are those that hate keyboard<br/>
turning, but other than that, mouselook and button clicking tends to slow<br/>
you down in combat, especially when there&#39;s a lot going on.<br/>
<br/>
You have to LOOK for the cursor, make sure it&#39;s on the right button, click<br/>
it, and move it elsewhere, whereas with keyboard commands, it&#39;s all<br/>
intuitive, and you never have to take your eyes off the text box.  Cycling<br/>
songs is easier too, it&#39;s just tap tap then tap tap again.<br/>
<br/>
I use the mouse to open distant doors (the U key most times, if I&#39;m going<br/>
through), to target mobs at long range (other times, it&#39;s my N key, which is<br/>
mapped to Nearest NPC), and to loot mobs and open trade windows.  And of<br/>
course to juggle inventory around.  I will mouselook in places like<br/>
Cauldron, where there&#39;s a lot of cliffs, as I can avoid falls easier, being<br/>
able to hug the hillsides.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, it&#39;s all keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
As far as having assist mapped, it&#39;s two quick key strokes to change<br/>
hotboxes. In my case, I use F2-F6 to target the party member, then SHIFT 4,<br/>
then 4, I&#39;ve just assisted my target.  Takes less than half a second.  Then<br/>
I hit SHIFT 3, then 1, to fire up my combat song, then 5 to bellow, or 6 to<br/>
lull, etc.  Combat is done, I hit SHIFT 2, then move weapons down and lute<br/>
up, after hitting 6 to sing Hymn.  While I&#39;m hymning, I&#39;ll hit SHIFT 4<br/>
again, then 3, to Forage, or 2 to Track.  Health is back, we&#39;re ready to<br/>
fight again, it&#39;s SHIFT 2, put weapons back in hand, SHIFT 3, get ready to<br/>
fight again.  If we have to run away, no matter which hotbox I&#39;m on, it&#39;s 3,<br/>
Selos starts.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Macro setup for bards<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ReeceT@...">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The recent discussion on the use of the /assist command has got me<br/>
wondering<br/>
&gt;how other bards setup their macros.  For myself, up to this point I have<br/>
&gt;only used one bank (6 hot-keys) of macros.  I have not setup the other five<br/>
&gt;banks.  If I have confused anyone, I use the term bank to refer to the six<br/>
&gt;buttons you can hotkey in the lower left hand portion of your screen.  You<br/>
&gt;can hit Shift-# to switch banks or you can use your mouse to cycle through<br/>
&gt;them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For my first bank, I have two inventory slots and two melee slots macroed<br/>
so<br/>
&gt;I quickly switch from weapon/shield to an instrument if the situation calls<br/>
&gt;for it.  I have hot-keyed Sense Heading and Foraging to take up the other<br/>
&gt;two slots.  I hotkeyed Sense Heading so when I am fleeing I dont have to<br/>
&gt;worry about switching macro banks.  I have Foraging hotkeyed so I can<br/>
&gt;continually click on it in between combats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t worried about macroing songs because I can click on them with my<br/>
&gt;mouse just as easy as hitting the hotkey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m beginning to think that I should place /assist on my main macro bank<br/>
but<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t like the idea of moving Sense Heading or Forage to another bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How does everyone else have their hotkeys setup?<br/>
