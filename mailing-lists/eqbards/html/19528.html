dreadlands outside Karanor&#39;s Castle.<br/>

Myself and a few other folks from my guild who are plodding through hell #45<br/>
were amazed at the relative XP gain we saw there...it was my first time<br/>
really getting down and dirty in Kunark and it was a blast.<br/>

I may make it through 45 after all...<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Treasure changes in Frontier Mountains<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
List seems awful quiet today.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone notice any difference in the drops in Frontier since the patch?  They<br/>
said they increased the loot, but I haven&#39;t noticed any changes.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know that the loot really needed that much tweaking, certainly hadn&#39;t<br/>
noticed it being radically less than similarly dangerous areas.  Any<br/>
thoughts?<br/>
