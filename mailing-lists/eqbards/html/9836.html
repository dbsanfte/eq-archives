<div id="ygrps-yiv-161019132">Well, it is true. Armor TYPE matters. That&#39;s why you see wizards taking full <br/>
dmg when hit alot more than plate-wearers do. That&#39;s why you AVOID getting <br/>
hit at all costs when you are a caster.<br/>
<br/>
The patch I spoke of that implemented Armor TYPES (as opposed to just AC) <br/>
was introduced toward the end of beta 3. An old friend of mine named Tabin <br/>
(the person that inspired me to become a bard) was one of a few players that <br/>
was selected to test out the changes with a GM. He was given sets of <br/>
different armor and attacked monsters so the GM could get an idea of how the <br/>
armor type patch was working The difference was like night and day.<br/>

&gt;You would expect this to be the case but I don&#39;t think anyone has ever<br/>
&gt;confirmed it to be true.  This topic has been discussed on many occasions <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;this list.  As far as I know, no one has been able to determine if AC is <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;only factor in determining how much damage you receive per hit or if armor<br/>
&gt;type plays a role (i.e. deflects part of the blow).  Guess the best way to<br/>
&gt;test it is to find a monk with the same AC as you and start collecting <br/>
&gt;data.<br/>
