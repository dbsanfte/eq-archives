<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129939879">Just an FYI to all you talking about hiving such High Charisma... I<br/>
really don&#39;t think it&#39;s to blame for the problem some bards are saying<br/>
they are having with charm. My CHA is only 102, and I regularly charm,<br/>
HG, SG, Griffons, etc. I get some resists, but am still able to do it<br/>
will confidence that I will win.<br/>
<br/>
If fact, my resist rate is ~50%. (of course once it works it seems<br/>
easier the next time). But if my resist rate was 90%, I could still<br/>
charm and win. It would take a bit longer i&#39;m sure...<br/>
<br/>
These stats are for soloing, not charming in group tactics. in that<br/>
case, a 50% resist rate is bad, possible deadly.<br/>
