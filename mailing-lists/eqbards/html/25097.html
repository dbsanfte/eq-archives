<div id="ygrps-yiv-18299001">Yet another version is out.  (Sorry to send out so many rapid fire, <br/>
version 2.0 was a major change, and I&#39;m trying to keep it as accurate <br/>
as I can.)<br/>
<br/>
You can get the latest version from here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/eqreed/BardSongSpreadsheet.html">http://www.geocities.com/eqreed/BardSongSpreadsheet.html</a> , and it <br/>
should appear shortly at www.eqsongs.com and www.eqdiva.com<br/>
<br/>
Here are the changes:<br/>
<br/>
Dennon&#39;s Horn of Disaster is brass instrument (doh!)<br/>
Fixed more gross math errors in Snare (23), and noted it stacks with <br/>
other snares now.<br/>
Instrument Modifiers:<br/>
   Brahmns Horn has a 2.1 multiplier (not 2.0)<br/>
   Flute of the Sacred Glade is 2.5 (not 1.8 )<br/>
   Lute of the Howeler is 2.2 (2.4)<br/>
   Ervaj&#39;s Flute of Flight is 1.9 (not 2.9).<br/>
   Minotaur Horn is 1.8 (not 2.0).<br/>
   Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo is 2.5 (not 2.4).<br/>
Spelling errors corrected (including the Cantana to Cantata <br/>
change ;) )<br/>
<br/>
As always, if you spot any errors or have any suggestions, you can <br/>
post here or e-mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqreed@...">eqreed@...</a><br/>
