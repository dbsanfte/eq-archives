<div id="ygrps-yiv-451561743">Armor should not be a problem.  Never ever buy weapons or armor from stores!<br/>
Always buy from other players, because you&#39;ll -usually- get a better deal.<br/>
Just type /auction Looking for patchwork armor in (large/small/medium)!<br/>
For 1 pp you should be able to pick up a -full- set of patchwork armor, I<br/>
have heard tailors making just such a package deal, and it&#39;s nearly as good<br/>
as leather.  Later, you should set your eyes on player-made banded armor,<br/>
better than that store ringmail, and far far cheaper.  More and more smiths<br/>
are competing now, and I was pleasantly surprised when a group of smiths<br/>
were making banded armor for COST (supplies) in greater faydark!  A fletcher<br/>
joined in and started doing the same thing!  Then there were free binds!<br/>
Hallelulia, the power gamers aren&#39;t just high level now!!!  I have seen<br/>
banded tunics and pants for as high as 30 pp each, bought mine for 15 pp<br/>
each from a fellow with &quot;guaranteed&quot; lowest prices.  When shopping, head to<br/>
the zone where a /who gives a large number.  Shop around, when in doubt<br/>
about a price someone offers you, ask someone else if it&#39;s fair.<br/>
<br/>
Even with magic items, buying from players your best bet.  I can sell a<br/>
Cuthroat Dervish Ring to my guild for 3gp, and then the guild will turn<br/>
around and sell it for 4pp!  Players will sell you their Dervish Rings for<br/>
less than 1pp.<br/>
<br/>
So avoid the easy temptation of dealing with an NPC whenever you can.<br/>
Unload the junk on em is all, and buy your water if you can&#39;t scavenge it<br/>
yourself.  Only wish we could milk our own cows.  :)<br/>

&gt;Part of my problem obviously is my dismal state of armor.  I have next to<br/>
&gt;none..  Where do I get it and for how much?  Part of my problem is lack of<br/>
&gt;funds.  I&#39;ve never been able to get more than a plat or two more than the<br/>
&gt;cost of my next song.  I&#39;ve also been buying every song when I level - I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;since read that is not always the best way to go..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks Again!<br/>

&gt;&gt; Welp, all of the replies are true but I think you are not fully utilizing<br/>
&gt;&gt; the bard. The bard my be the second best soloing class there is. Im 20th<br/>
&gt;&gt; level now and still soloing. You may be playing the bard like a fighter<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;&gt; occasional sings a song. Wrong. At 9th level go to Ro. Make sure you got<br/>
