<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248287713">If you killed CauldronBoil the shark, one of his drops is the Sharkjaw<br/>
Cutlass (10/32 weight 2.0).  It&#39;s a very nice weapon with a great curved and<br/>
serrated look to it that I won a roll for.  I get inspected *a lot* wielding<br/>
this weapon, and I get tells from out of the blue from people saying<br/>
&quot;soandso told me you have a sharkjaw, what&#39;re the stats?&quot;  When people ask I<br/>
tell them &quot;10/32 weight 2.0, procs Player Inspections&quot;.<br/>

&gt; Ps, been residing in Kedge the last few days, exp is great there and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; good fun. Anyone know what kind of good stuff drops there? Our group have<br/>
&gt; been as low as the 2nd level and it&#39;s damn scary. We killed a Cauldron<br/>
&gt; shark and then a Hammerhead shark spawned in it&#39;s place, it was<br/>
&gt; red a level 38 so I am wondering if it&#39;s a named mob that drops something<br/>
