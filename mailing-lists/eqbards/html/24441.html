<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742581873">Looking way ahead in my questing, I&#39;ve wondered if any of you have had any<br/>
luck with our newly placed mob in the Hole, the scalekeeper type person.<br/>
Has it been confirmed that he drops both white and red dragonscales?  He&#39;s<br/>
said to be L55. Does he fight like VS? And since I&#39;ve personally been on no<br/>
raids on VS, I don&#39;t know the tactics used on him either. If anyone would be<br/>
able to sneak in some secrets on how to kill this scalekeeper, or if he does<br/>
in fact fight like Venril Sathir, how to defeat him.<br/>
<br/>
And is it true that the &quot;spawned&quot; or &quot;mini&quot; Trakanon is just L55, which<br/>
drops only the guts for our quest? About how many would it take, and approx<br/>
Levels to defeat him at this level?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for any information you all can provide for our fellow<br/>
bards who read the list  ;)<br/>
