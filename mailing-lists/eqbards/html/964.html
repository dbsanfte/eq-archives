<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829283742">This Amulet of Order is a fairly good artifact to have!  A few AC, +5<br/>
Charisma, and it acts like a lightstone!  I&#39;ve been debating whether or not<br/>
to discard my spiked collar for it (+3 strength) but I&#39;m thinking with<br/>
discussions here I&#39;ll just start wearing that amulet.  Of course, it&#39;s a<br/>
quest item, but I have a feeling the reward won&#39;t be as good as the quest<br/>
item itself.  (the quest-giver didn&#39;t like me much, few levels back when I<br/>
just gave it to her, so who knows.)<br/>

It comes off the poor undead knight, the one who wacks you over and over and<br/>
pleads with you to put him out of his misery, and is fairly easy to put<br/>
down... I must have killed him around level five before.  Back then, just<br/>
don&#39;t remember this pendant having the qualities it does now.  He is part of<br/>
a quest that can be found in the Qeynos temple.  He is in the Qeynos<br/>
aquaducts.  I remember encountering him roaming the main passages before,<br/>
but this time I found him -just- behind the secret passage near the &quot;beware<br/>
the ratslayer&quot; graffiti.  If you go back there, be careful though.  Further<br/>
in a deathtrap.<br/>
