&gt;I&#39;m not too concerned yet, but did anyone else playing last night notice a<br/>
&gt;staggering drop in the number of procs that their weapons are firing?  I was<br/>
&gt;fighting Ogre Bouncers inside Oggok last night with my Ykesha and I believe<br/>
&gt;the number of times it fired over the course of about 4 hours of play was<br/>
&gt;either 2 or 3 - that&#39;s a very serious drop, perhaps an order of magnitude.<br/>
&gt;The last hour or so I loaded up all of my DEX equipment and played Chant of<br/>
&gt;Battle and had a DEX of 186 and didn&#39;t proc once.  After killing Bouncers I<br/>
&gt;ran over to Cazic-Thule and beat on some lizzies and gators for testing<br/>
&gt;purposes (also 186 DEX) and got not a single proc while there (around 20<br/>
&gt;solo kills).<br/>
