<div id="ygrps-yiv-964663380"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Btw, I understand your philosophical concerns, but isn&#39;t it the case<br/>
&gt; that:  1) an unscrupulous company could scan our disks anyway and most of<br/>
&gt; us would have no clue, 2) their proposed EULA did NOT give them<br/>
&gt; permission to look at anything that wasn&#39;t EQ-related, and 3) they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; much too sloppy and overburdened to go through the hassle which would<br/>
&gt; be required to actually make use of any other information?  I think you<br/>
&gt; give them too much credit if you think they&#39;re capable of doing anything<br/>
&gt; other than keeping their heads above water.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Umm actually that&#39;s not the point but I&#39;ll make this clear:<br/>
Some of us that play EQ work for companies that made us sign non-disclosure<br/>
agreements regarding the companies intellectual properties.  That means, if<br/>
I take work home, and I let someone see what I&#39;m doing.  My company can come<br/>
sue me.  Now, if some company does it without my knowledge (IE:  Hacks my<br/>
system) then my company will sue them, not me.  But if I sign an agreement<br/>
letting a company scan the contents of my active memory and some sensitive<br/>
data happens to be in there then *I* am responsible and I can lose my job<br/>
and wind up in jail.  (not that it&#39;s likely, but it is possible).<br/>
<br/>
Asside from that little nastiness there is the issue of personal privacy.<br/>
It&#39;s not *my* fault that some moron out there is hacking EQ.  That&#39;s<br/>
Verant&#39;s problem.  The fact remains that they could scan my memory and<br/>
active tasks and just shut down EQ if it has whatever they&#39;re looking for.<br/>
If it doesn&#39;t I play as normal.  This way no data is being transmitted from<br/>
my computer that may be sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I DO know exactly what gets sent across my network, through my<br/>
firewall and to anyone connected to my PC.  I busted AOL trying it a while<br/>
back when my roomate used it and I caught Verant&#39;s little shinanigan&#39;s as<br/>
well.  I&#39;m a network engineer by trade, network security is part of my job<br/>
;)<br/>

&gt; PS - Perhaps having to deal with a paranoid schizophrenic ex has made me<br/>
&gt; overly sensitive to conspiracy theories.  It&#39;s pretty hard to live in<br/>
&gt; this world when you distrust everyone&#39;s motives all the time.  Much<br/>
&gt; better just to distrust everyone&#39;s competence.  Works for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not that I distrust their motives.  It&#39;s that they are violating my<br/>
private property.  And accessing *my* intellectual rights.  It&#39;s not that I<br/>
don&#39;t trust Verant.  It&#39;s that I don&#39;t want someone else saying &quot;But it was<br/>
ok when Verant did it for their game!  I want to do it for X&quot;.  Where does<br/>
it stop?  Something people don&#39;t seem to realize, once you give up a thing,<br/>
it&#39;s VERY hard to take it back again.  I personally choose not to allow that<br/>
level of personal privacy to be violated.  My PC is like my car.  I&#39;m not<br/>
likely to give VI the keys to my car am I?<br/>
<br/>
This is all moot now anyway ;)  Since they decided to be smart and not<br/>
implement their system scan (which was a scan of the active task list (API<br/>
32 Call) and the contents of active memory).<br/>
