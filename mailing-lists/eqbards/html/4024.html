&gt; A friend and I visited it for the first time this<br/>
&gt; weekend.<br/>
&gt; While we did not see any sea monsters while<br/>
&gt; swimming, we<br/>
&gt; *just* missed a red named froglok (Prince Krymt<br/>
&gt; something or<br/>
&gt; other) who, I assume because of our rampages in Guk,<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &quot;ready to attack&quot; us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah yes you are aright. So much so I can&#39;t believe I<br/>
forgot about the Prince. He is fierce. He is the<br/>
roving InstaDeath (for most) NPC you have to watch for<br/>
in this zone. He actually does make a circle around<br/>
the whole lake. But if you watch out for him you<br/>
should be able to avoid him. First time I went to Lake<br/>
Rathe was with another character. We found the Prince<br/>
on the strip of land which leads to the Rathe<br/>
Mountains zone. It was one of those, &quot;Hey look at that<br/>
guy..uhh he is red.. ack and ready to<br/>
attack...and..and.. Friend gets hammered. We saw him<br/>
any times after that and were able to avoid him each<br/>
time :)<br/>
