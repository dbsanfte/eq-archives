<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045281953">Has anyone noticed that the new bard song uses more mana since the last<br/>
patch, last night in Sol B King room our group was holding all 3 rooms<br/>
(whole zone was empty). So we had non stop action and at times there were<br/>
3/4 kobolds coming at us that agro from other rooms, I was using charm and<br/>
after a 4 kobold fight my mana was down 2 bubs. I sat and med but it didn&#39;t<br/>
regen fast enough, looks as though this song now uses 20 mana per cast<br/>
instead of the original 5 mana. Ok ok, you must be wondering why I am using<br/>
the level 39 charm song on kobolds? Well, some Solusek Kobolds are too<br/>
high, so I just use the level 39 song to avoid this....we was also pulling<br/>
bats/bugs so it&#39;s handy to have for that too. It looks as though this song<br/>
is gonna have to be used in rations....<br/>

One problem with that theory:<br/>
<br/>
The new charm was not level capped, at all.  I and a friend play on test.<br/>
<br/>
A GM buffed my freind to 55<br/>
My friend could then charm any creature in the game (My friend is in the<br/>
Kunark beta test and was even charming kunark monsters the GM summoned up<br/>
for him to try charm on).<br/>
<br/>
In short:  There WAS no cap.  The song was WAY out of balance.  a 10 level<br/>
cap isn&#39;t that bad, we can charm up to level 49 with it now, which seems<br/>
VERY fair to me.  I think it&#39;s wrong for us to be able to charm the<br/>
uber-mobs out there.  That&#39;s just plain silly.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I&#39;m a roleplayer ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sorry, I agree with Sartori here.  Yah it was AWESOME to have such a<br/>
&gt; &gt; powerful charm.  But it was hardly realistic.  And to be honest I<br/>
seriously<br/>
&gt; &gt; doubt the gods and planes will remain weaker than kunark long.  Be<br/>
watching<br/>
&gt; &gt; for some serious upgrades to the alternate planes once Kunark hits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, see, if that&#39;s true and they&#39;re going to upgrade the<br/>
&gt; god/dragon levels, then it made no sense to nerf the new bard<br/>
&gt; song.  OTOH, if they keep them the same level and reserve the<br/>
&gt; L55-60 spectrum for god/dragon-level mobs, then it makes sense<br/>
&gt; (and likewise enchanters will never get a charm that&#39;ll work<br/>
&gt; on L55).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>
