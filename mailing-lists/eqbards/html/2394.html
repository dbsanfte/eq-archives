You&#39;re missing my point.<br/>
<br/>
In my mind I can justify gadgetry that is intended as part of the game or<br/>
is separate from the game but can in a reasonable way be considered part of<br/>
the game, such as this mailing list or externally obtained maps.  Mailing<br/>
lists and maps are straightforward ways for people to exchange information<br/>
and can be kept somewhat in game.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is using programming internals to further my ability to beat the<br/>
computer program.  That&#39;s not the game I want to play.  It&#39;s too much like<br/>
disassembling code to decypher the operating system so I can write whizbang<br/>
programs of my own, or getting playing hints by printing out all the text<br/>
messages from the software.  That&#39;s playing the computer system, not the game.<br/>
<br/>
/loc and the grid system are program mechanisms, not a game world feature.<br/>
<br/>
This is an old, familiar argument.  I&#39;ve had it before about exploiting<br/>
rule glitches in live roleplaying games.  Some people do because they get<br/>
more power.  Others won&#39;t because they want to play the fantasy game, not<br/>
the external rules.  I&#39;m of the latter group and as a game rules designer<br/>
tried to eliminate the abilities of the former.<br/>
