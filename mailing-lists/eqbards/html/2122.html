<div id="ygrps-yiv-945508625">First off, yeah my character&#39;s name is Barrd (Supposed to be &quot;Bard&quot;, but<br/>
that damned name filter...), which is a character I&#39;ve RP&#39;d since the good<br/>
old days of NWN.   So no need to &quot;Hey, great name ;ppp&quot; me, I&#39;ve already<br/>
heard it all =oP<br/>
Question, does anyone know if there is any plan in the future for bards to<br/>
be able to bind themselves?  Just kinda seems silly that we&#39;re supposed to<br/>
be the most traveling class in Norrath, but can&#39;t bind. =o/  Also, any word<br/>
on why Selo&#39;s disrupts other group member&#39;s SoW?<br/>
