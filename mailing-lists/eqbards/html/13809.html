<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003382357">A true dungeon crawl in EQ would only work if at the end of the dungeon<br/>
there was some type of reward that provided enough incentive to not camp.<br/>
This could be a major EXP gain from killing the boss mob or a treasure chest<br/>
that contained several items in it.  The level of the mobs throughout the<br/>
dungeon would have to be close enough that the party got EXP for mobs both<br/>
at the beginning and at the end.  There would also have to be a mechanism to<br/>
prevent a party from camping the boss mob over and over again. Lot more<br/>
other factors but these are the key ones.  Most likely in the &quot;to hard to<br/>
do&quot; category for EQ.  Maybe not for EQ2.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The dungeon crawl vision is antithical to camping.  If you try<br/>
&gt; to make both coexist, either the dungeon crawlers get way too<br/>
&gt; little &quot;prize&quot; loot, or the campers get way too much.  <br/>
&gt; Duplicating zones would ease overcrowding, but it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; change the campquest state of the game.  Even if you<br/>
&gt; duplicated each zone so many times that each party were<br/>
&gt; practically alone in their own dungeon, the crawl party would<br/>
&gt; only see maybe one special mob per night while the camp party<br/>
&gt; would see multiple.  Too little or too much.<br/>
