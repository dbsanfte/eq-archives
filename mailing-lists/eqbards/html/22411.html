After 2 semi-retirments, I made it official last night.<br/>
<br/>
The last straw:<br/>
Elfson is killed by his own pet.  I don&#39;t bother petitioning, because I<br/>
know<br/>
the answer.  A long time friend of mine, leaves her camp deep in Karnors to<br/>
rez me (at the moat).  About an hour later in a amazing heated battle (5<br/>
mobs with no enchanter), we somehow prevail (amazing what 6 players who<br/>
know<br/>
what they&#39;re doing can accomplish) and I level to 48.  Strangely I really<br/>
don&#39;t feel very happy.<br/>
<br/>
I switch to Eetbugz (my twink warrior).  An iksar maurader flees through a<br/>
wall, so I sit down to bring him back to me.  He comes back under the<br/>
earth,<br/>
and kills me befor I can make it to the zone.  I petition, and after half<br/>
an<br/>
hour a guide tells me they will forward my petition to the proper<br/>
authorities for investigation..  90 minutes of saying my goodbyes to my<br/>
guild and friends (I tell them I will wait until the day before my next pay<br/>
cycle before making it official, giving me time to reconsider).  I give up<br/>
waiting for my petition and begin to run.  A goblin caster agros me through<br/>
a wall, and this blue caster kills me before I ever see him.<br/>

yes I&#39;m sure<br/>

I&#39;d like to thank all the bards here for all their help (and for putting up<br/>
with me), too many names to name, and I dont want to leave anyone out.<br/>
This<br/>
has been a fun and informative set of emails for a very long time for me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll start the &quot;Former Bards of Norrath&quot; guild if Anarchy Online ever<br/>
makes it public :-)<br/>
