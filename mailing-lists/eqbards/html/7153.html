&gt; This all looks really good (although I&#39;ll stand by my belief in Forage not<br/>
&gt; being too low).  If no one has any oppositional posts by next week, I say<br/>
&gt; send it.<br/>

most of us have our primary hotkeys set up for songs, so it&#39;s not as<br/>
convenient as the other classes to be constantly foraging. However, I<br/>
find there&#39;s a huge difference in foraging success with my druid with<br/>
forage at 85 compared to my bard. By the time bards get forage, the 4-6<br/>
cp for milk and muffins is really quite trivial, IMO. They should either<br/>
give the skill to bards at a lower level or just take it away, as<br/>
currently it&#39;s a waste of time to have.<br/>
