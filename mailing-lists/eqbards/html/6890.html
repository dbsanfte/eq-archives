<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-62607071">Dear fellow bards I wholeheartedly agree with Gatlin on the relative<br/>
uselesness of the lvl 14 song....here is my thought on a possible<br/>
replacement to it.<br/>
<br/>
Song of Thorns<br/>
<br/>
A party effect that is a damage shield for  few ticks of damage,  not unlike<br/>
a thistlecoat effect. It is DEFINATELY level appropriate as druids get their<br/>
shields early on.<br/>
<br/>
Elyana Silvanae<br/>
Bardess of the 40th Chorus<br/>
Innoruuk Server</div>
