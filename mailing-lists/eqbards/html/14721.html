&gt; Why would you want to play AE songs?  What songs are you talking about?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are in Guk without an enchanter, you are probably the person who will<br/>
&gt; need to do crowd control.  So, if (or more like when) you get more than one<br/>
&gt; mob, you will be doing Pixie strike.  If you have an enchanter, you will not<br/>
&gt; want to use AE and break the mobs out of their messed states (ok, Largos<br/>
&gt; does not break enchanter mez so that is one option.)<br/>

the zone, I used lullaby at least once on an over pull in the undead<br/>
tower. It worked and we all lived.<br/>

&gt; In lower Guk, I&#39;d think you would want to buff your tanks: chant and<br/>
&gt; celerity or anthem and elemental if you are fighting casters. If you are in<br/>
&gt; a situation with multiple mobs and no crowd control, that is a problem.  And<br/>
&gt; playing area effect damage songs is not the solution.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another time we had an over pull (again in the undead tower) and I fired<br/>
up screech to try to get 4 mobs off our druid so he could get off an<br/>
evac. The train that came back 15 sec later with the feared frogs was<br/>
the scariest I&#39;d seen there. We got all the gargoyles and every other<br/>
frog in the tower too. Heh. Didn&#39;t last too long.<br/>
