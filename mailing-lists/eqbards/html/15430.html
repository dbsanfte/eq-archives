a few shin-level frogs that spawn near there, and make good<br/>
charming targets (well, as good as live frogs get - they tend<br/>
to want to attack you all the time).  The dead side will work<br/>

about a bubble every hour or two there with a competent group<br/>
that knows how to work around the bugs in the zone.<br/>
