<div id="ygrps-yiv-510747857">There&#39;s a problem with that sort of argument, though.  If your primary goal<br/>
as a bard is to do damage in the group, you&#39;re missing out on well over half<br/>
of what the class can do that&#39;s more effective than adding more damage.  I<br/>
don&#39;t sing dots in a group, I&#39;ll leave the serious damage dealing to the<br/>
tanks and casters.  I&#39;d rather make them more able to do their jobs than try<br/>
to do it for them.<br/>
