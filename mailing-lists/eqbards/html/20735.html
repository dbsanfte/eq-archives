<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867729448">I know our guild is always happy to have new additions on E&#39;ci.  Given the<br/>
number of bards on E&#39;ci though, you&#39;ll have lots of competition!  Not all<br/>
our guild members are RP&#39;ers by nature, but almost all will fall into line<br/>
when the real RP&#39;ers start spouting off in character.  We&#39;ve converted a few<br/>
totally anti-RP computer gamers into joining our pen&paper rpg groups and<br/>
they love it!<br/>
<br/>
Kitasi is generally fairly irritated by beggars as well.  I don&#39;t mind the<br/>
occasional, can anyone spare some extra food and water? or can anyone spare<br/>
some bone chips? that I hear, but the incessant Have you got any cool stuff<br/>
I can have?&#39;s get to me.  I told the last guy who said that, &quot;No, sorry<br/>
friend.  I just gave my last cool item to that poor little mute girl over<br/>
there, she works so hard and no one ever pays her any attention.&quot;  I then<br/>
pointed to the newbie halfling I had drive-by twinked with a FS scimitar.<br/>
She must have thanked me at least a dozen times since she still had her<br/>
starting short sword.  Needless to say the guy was not amused.  In fact he<br/>
didn&#39;t even get it, roleplaying was totally beyond him.<br/>

You have a point about anti-RP stuff in the game.  It<br/>
is a different environment altogether from what we<br/>
consider traditional RP environment.  That said, I<br/>
find that my characters develop a personality of their<br/>
own after a time.  Terrok, my druid is kind of dour<br/>
and a bit of a hardass.  As an officer in the guild,<br/>
he enforces some of the rules others fear to mention. <br/>
He is not well liked.<br/>
<br/>
My shaman, Fenryr always &quot;throws a small sack of bones<br/>
on the ground and studies them carefully&quot; when asked<br/>
for a SOW.  The spirits may require a gift for his<br/>
magic to work -- it might be a bone chip, it might be<br/>
a bottle of kalish and it might be free...but the<br/>
price is the price and the spirits can&#39;t be denied;-)<br/>
<br/>
Tyunes on the other hand is just a happy guy.  He<br/>
sings to passers by and usually has something good to<br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
All my characters have a thing about beggars.  I think<br/>
begging takes away from the game.  Terrok and Fenryr<br/>
never give anything away, Tyunes likes to surprise<br/>
young bards with hand-me-down items.  Ask and you<br/>
won&#39;t get. Offer to buy or just be polite and Tyunes<br/>
will normally help out.<br/>

&gt; EQ a lot. I think it is<br/>
&gt; because the game itself requires so much logistics<br/>
&gt; discussion. Logistics can<br/>
&gt; be diffcult enough when you are exchanging raw data<br/>
&gt; much less gussying it<br/>
&gt; up, and so  people tend to be dirrect, which tends<br/>
&gt; to sound pretty OOC.<br/>
&gt; Guildsay also breaks the RP framework, because there<br/>
&gt; is no premise at all of<br/>
&gt; sharing a physical (okay virtual Phisical) location.<br/>
&gt; How do you RP for more<br/>
&gt; than a short span when one person is in the Field of<br/>
&gt; bone as an Iksar and<br/>
&gt; another in LGuk as a High Elf? Then add that the<br/>
&gt; High Elf wants the Iksar<br/>
&gt; player to quit playing a secondary and come help...<br/>
&gt; Not that it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; possible to counter the effect, just that it is hard<br/>
&gt; work.<br/>
