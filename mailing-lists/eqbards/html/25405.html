<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741611920">Rokenn, let me right off the bat say I&#39;ve always had great respect for you<br/>
and the work you&#39;ve put into your bard and your site. My email is not<br/>
intended as a bash to you or your guild, but this thread has me concerned.<br/>

I think its cool that a guild would be attempting this, but if the warders<br/>
dont respawn, then to me, bites,  and will have an impact on the entire<br/>
server community, not just ew, dw and vv but futur guilds that would like to<br/>
go to ST as well... Take Rathe for example, it supposedly has had no warder<br/>
spawn since the sleeper was awakened.  :(<br/>
<br/>
I might have my info wrong, I might not, either way I hope they dont go<br/>
away.<br/>
