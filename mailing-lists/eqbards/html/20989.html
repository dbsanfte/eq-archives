<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574001356">My secondary is a Rouge and is 9th level.  Our newbie<br/>
group will be going to steamfont tonight to hunt<br/>
Minatours(sp).  My bubby is playing the bard in this<br/>
group and is doing quite well twisting at the young<br/>
age of 10.  Teien (my main char) carries a minatour<br/>
horn and we want to get one for Jamwen.  I would <br/>
also like to have an extra in the bank.  The point of all this <br/>
is that I have not played in Fay and would like some<br/>
advice on steamfont zone.  Any advice out there?<br/>
