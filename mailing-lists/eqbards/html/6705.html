&gt;Is this documented somewhere?  I have heard no reports of actual damage<br/>
&gt;after the patch, then again it is going to be hard to get exact numbers<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the PvP damage changes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Further, having an extra tick or not is a mute point really as we are not<br/>
Mana based. All it would effect is the the number of songs we can sing at<br/>
once, there is no reason to add a tick (if we got one great, I will put<br/>
another song into rotation, if not no big deal) of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Now as to a post that came in while I was writing this...this has been a<br/>
great list, lots of information, supportive of people who show up. I know I<br/>
am not alone in thinking it would be an unwanted raising of the noise level<br/>
to start with a lot of whining and kvetching about the class.<br/>
<br/>
What exatly is so broken we have to give our freetime over to complaining<br/>
about the class? Show me where I am not a balanced effective class! yes<br/>
there are things that might be better, but being a &quot;sqeeky wheel&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>
make things better, it just makes one the sort of person who is a squeeky<br/>
wheel. And, um, yuck.<br/>
I am happy to start loud protests about something that matters (I did after<br/>
all raise more and larger armies than anyone in UO, all about ingame<br/>
situations that &quot;mattered&quot;) but I have yet to see anything so broken or<br/>
horrible that deserves my time. The class is largely fun and useful and<br/>
functional and non-gimped. I play my bard well, and have yet to see a<br/>
&quot;problem&quot;.<br/>
