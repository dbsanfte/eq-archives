<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923302285"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;Snip&gt;  On the up side, you CAN charm a PK(or fear them for that matter)<br/>
&gt; and have your level 50 wizard friends zap the hell out of a player they<br/>
&gt; could otherwise not hit since they have a linkdead &quot;flag&quot; set upon becoming<br/>
&gt; charmed or feared.  Now THERE&#39;s some bard revenge for you. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m think of trying a bard on the race war server.  Could you explain what<br/>
&gt; you mean by this statement, especially &#39;linkdead flag&#39;?   Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll try, as I was a victim of this rather awful bug a few days ago.  Currently,<br/>
when your character is charmed or feared by another played, you become, for<br/>
all intensive purposes, an NPC.  Normally, Rallos Zek has a +/- 4 levels attack<br/>
limit in effect - I&#39;m level 26, so no one higher than 30 should be able to attack<br/>
me.<br/>
But, while under the fear spell a level 30 necro cast on me, I was very quickly<br/>
slaughtered by her level 35+ druid friend.  (Thank goodness friends were nearby<br/>
to loot me, whew!)  Another annoying side effect of this bug is that if you die<br/>
while feared or charmed, you are disconnected from the server and have to re log in.<br/>
<br/>
After numerous petitions, a guide informed me this was a known bug and would<br/>
be fixed the next patch. (hah!)  Given Verants track record with PvP bugs, I&#39;m not<br/>
holding my breath...  but at least I can fear them before they fear me now. :)<br/>
