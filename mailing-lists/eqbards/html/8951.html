<b>Subject:</b> RE: Resist on chains gotten worse lately? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427302031">Like all of the named mobs - they (Dorn, Dvinn, Gixx, etal.) fite lots<br/>
harder than they con.  I wonder who at V has the job of buffing & twinking<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
Also - it&#39;s my belief that the color con is firstly and indicator of how<br/>
much xp you will get if you win the fight - NOT any indication of how hard<br/>
the fight will be.  <br/>
<br/>
These guys (Dvinn, Dorn, etc etc) have huge magic resists and some really<br/>
uber-buffs.  At 32 I cruised through N Ro and some lev 15&#39;s talked me into<br/>
bouncing Dorn.  Man was I glad to have their help!  That little inkie took<br/>
me down below half HP.  <br/>
<br/>
I saw a lot of resists.  <br/>
<br/>
Beyond that - resists to chains - and I think all song spells have to pass<br/>
the &#39;random&#39; resist test.  Gnoll pups in Qeynos will resist me - so there is<br/>
a test that is not level difference based.  maybe you hit a bad clump in the<br/>
Rnd generator (random number.)<br/>

		Well, I was chaining SG&#39;s last night no problem.  Maybe 1<br/>
resist in about 50<br/>
		attempts. (I was soloing, so a LOT of chaining was used).<br/>
Later I was<br/>
		walking by Dorn&#39;s camp and decided to kill him just to pass<br/>
a minute or two.<br/>
		After pounding him down to within an inch of his life, he<br/>
started to run.  I<br/>
		fired up chains.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.<br/>
Resist.  5 resists<br/>
		before it took.  Dunno if its always been like this or not<br/>
with Dorn, last<br/>
		time I fought him I was around level 15.  Seemed strange<br/>
though.<br/>

		Last night the Cerf.net servers all went down so I logged<br/>
into Tarrew<br/>
		Marr to play my bard for the first time in a while. I<br/>
decided to go see<br/>
		if I could kill some hill giants in W Commons and while<br/>
looking ran<br/>
		across Kizdean Gix. He attacked dispite being 20 odd levels<br/>
below me and<br/>
		I fired up chains intending to chain and fear him. Hmm. 8<br/>
resists in a<br/>
		row. After killing him and determining there weren&#39;t any<br/>
hill giants in<br/>
		the zone, I happened to spot some big wisp spawns and killed<br/>
them.<br/>
		Again, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist<br/>
rates gone up<br/>
		on chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much<br/>
trouble last<br/>
		time I played my bard. My druid can get snare to stick on<br/>
reds with more<br/>
		reliability than this.<br/>
