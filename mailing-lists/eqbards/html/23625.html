&gt; Mediocre players: Playing my baby cleric (L9) last night and get asked to<br/>
&gt; heal a bard twink. When I stand up, I see he&#39;s singing Hymn. Where&#39;s your<br/>
&gt; lute, boy? Yep, this guy will be a good bard, you can just tell . . .<br/>
&gt; Another bard twink I saw the other day was clearly singing Selos and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not just twinks are mediocre players.  Last night a group of us went to the<br/>
Bar/Armorer area in Sebilis. Was me (55 bard), 59 SK, 59 Necro, 53 shamen,<br/>
54 cleric, 54 paladin.  We rocked the place, I had no trouble CC&#39;ing<br/>
anything.  Well this group broke up and I joined another group.  Now for the<br/>
mediocre group-----  me, 57 paladin, 52 cleric, 59 druid, 59 ranger, 54<br/>
rogue.  The damage output on the second group was killin things fast.  The<br/>
druid and the ranger were idiots though.  They insisted on using root as<br/>
crowd control (even after I repeatedly told them I had been CC&#39;ing with no<br/>
trouble for the last 2 hours in Bar/Armorer).  The stupid ranger was pulling<br/>
singles by rooting the extras at the spawn points.  So mid battle we would<br/>
end up with more mobs then if he had just pulled the 2 or 3 that where<br/>
there.  Then he pulled the bar room (using this lame root pulling) we got 4<br/>
adds all once (they ported in on us).  The cleric went invulnerable and just<br/>
as I got the adds under control the frickin druid evac&#39;d us!  Leaving the<br/>
invulverable cleric behind to die.  /sigh<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The FAQ: Talies, in reference to the last question, don&#39;t have a 49th song<br/>
&gt; now? Melody of Ervaj from Velious is listed as being 49th level. And<br/>
&gt; speaking of the issues of bad bards, wonder if we could get that fabulous<br/>
&gt; FAQ posted on the Concert Hall. It might possibly help the new crop of<br/>
&gt; bardlings.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The 49 song is Shield of Song.  Melody of Erjav is 50th not 49th.<br/>
