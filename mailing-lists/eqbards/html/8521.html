<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244348382"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I wonder if the GM/Guide bards have a percussion<br/>
&gt; instrument that is above, and beyond, the Drum of<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s March and/or Mistmoore Battledrum.  You<br/>
&gt; should have offered to trade :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From a reliable source.. Guides do not get *any* of their<br/>
class&#39;s spells or songs. They also do not get any<br/>
instruments or weapons (other than their staff of guiding)<br/>
to weild. They apparently have a belt of something or<br/>
another that gives them Spirit of Norrath. The guide you<br/>
saw running around wasn&#39;t using Selo&#39;s or a drum..</div>
