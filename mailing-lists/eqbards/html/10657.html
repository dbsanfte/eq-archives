<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245489186"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; song: Denon&#39;s Desparate Dirge, Lev 43, this site says damage is <br/>
&gt; 311+(lev-43)*2 making MAX dame at Lev 50 only 325, and does not <br/>
&gt; say anything about mana; CH says it does 275 dam and requires <br/>
&gt; 800mana?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The eqbards are definitely correct on this formula.  At level<br/>
  43, 44, 45 my Dirge dmgs matched 311, 313, 315.  (Basically,<br/>
  you get 2 dmg every level after you get the song - which is<br/>
  what the math says)  As for taking mana, I go from 5 bubbles<br/>
  to less than 1 bubble, and to cast again it takes around 45<br/>
  mins to 1 hour.  I use Dirge a lot, and have gotten good at<br/>
  moving out of range so I don&#39;t take the hit.  Using it on 3<br/>
  or more monsters makes it very effective.  And hell, if you&#39;ve<br/>
  got the mana - nuke em!<br/>
