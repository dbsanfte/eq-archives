<div id="ygrps-yiv-134581393">Well, Froggies of course (Guk), and the nearby we saw in trains: some bad<br/>
skellies, some bad minos (were they greater minos?) I am still such a newbie<br/>
there I can&#39;t make it to the zone when we have to run!  Stuff was blue and<br/>
up to us at 30 - spiders maybe yellow - certainly blue - sometimes we got 3<br/>
and 4 in the pull but preferred to get one or two. <br/>

		What level are the spideys here?  Also what else is nearby?<br/>
If they are low<br/>
		enough I have found Lullaby amazingly useful at nodding 4<br/>
baddies while I<br/>
		smack them one at a time.<br/>

		Go camp the bedroom on the dead side of Guk.  Pull the<br/>
deadly black widows<br/>
		and you will be sooooo full of that damn spider silk - it<br/>
won&#39;t be funny.<br/>
		You can also pull vampire bats and have stacks and stacks of<br/>
bat wings.  I<br/>
		master loot for my party and the sheer number of these<br/>
things made me turn<br/>
		on fast destroy for the first time.  You need a party for<br/>
this spot and got<br/>
		to watch for trains. <br/>
