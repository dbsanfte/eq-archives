<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083553143">That was my observation, too, Sylly.  Disenchanting Melody removes DOTs (but only <br/>
DOTs) (and it does so on the first pulse or not at all).  Of course, when I <br/>
mentioned this here, I did not get a lot of positive feedback.  ;)  Assuming <br/>
that it&#39;s working, though, it&#39;s still a crummy song.  I can think of few places <br/>
where it would rank among my top eight (although it might have been useful in <br/>
Befallen).  Maybe it only works on Innoruuk.  hehe<br/>

&gt; Why do you think it&#39;s broken?  I used it just the other day to remove DoT&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; It removes some things but not all things. I had to equip a string intru and<br/>
&gt; designate a target to play it on.  But he told me his DoT dropped right as I<br/>
&gt; played the song.<br/>

&gt; I hope when [GZ] reaches 22d level he will also realize that Disenchanting<br/>
&gt; Melody is broken.<br/>
