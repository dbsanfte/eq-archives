<div id="ygrps-yiv-768960736">As far as I know, any mobs over level 50 have the *potential* to Summon you.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean to say that all mobs over 51 summon, but that&#39;s the level<br/>
the tables turn.	<br/>
<br/>
The first time I was summoned was in Permafrost doing Ice Giants.  As an<br/>
indoor dungeon, Selo&#39;s is useless anyway, but it took me three attempts to<br/>
get away from the Ice Giant Priest (or was it the Magi?)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d run, he&#39;d summon and bash me a bit.  I&#39;d run again, get as far as the<br/>
portcullis and *shwoop*, summoned again.  I don&#39;t know how I managed to get<br/>
away that third time, but my heart was in my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Summoning requires mana or if it&#39;s an innate ability the<br/>
mobs have.  More experienced players will be able to tell you.<br/>

I&#39;ve not experienced summoning.  Is anything able to summon you, over a<br/>
certain level?  If so, and I keep running away, will it just keep summoning<br/>
me?  Assuming, of course, I can run again after the initial summoning...heh.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like that summoning thing...heh.  Dangit!  I&#39;m supposed to be able<br/>
to run away!!!  :)<br/>
