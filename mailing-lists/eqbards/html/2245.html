<br/>
I havent been PK&#39;d since level 5 and that was me at half health jumping on a<br/>
yellow mage for the hell of it.  Trick to the game is find a spot, stick<br/>
with it till they are blue then move on. There is no magical place where<br/>
your going to find a 17th level monster that drops 10 plat. Aint gonna<br/>
happen. Get your butt back to EK and stay there till you get crap for xp.<br/>
Then move on. The trick is to stay with it and know your turf. Most of the<br/>
PK&#39;s don&#39;t even bother with  me because I&#39;m not an easy kill. The secret?<br/>
RUN! Know thy turf....<br/>

&gt;&gt; Since you apparently are a person who has been PK&#39;d, I have some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>questions<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; about how PK works.  Not that I would ever play that way, I hated UO for<br/>
&gt;&gt; that one reason.  It&#39;s bad enough we got insta kill monsters, having to<br/>
&gt;&gt; worry about them, and other players attacking make it way to complicated<br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt; me.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyways, if you PK someone, how much can you loot?  Everything?<br/>
&gt;&gt; Percentages, etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt; also in a duel, if you win, what are you allowed to loot off the other<br/>
&gt;&gt; player?  Items?  Money?  Nothing?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I realize this is the wrong forum for theses questions, but dang it, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;&gt; been curious.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt;the rules for a pk are the same as looting rules for a duel ,,<br/>
&gt;you are able to loot anything that is equipped ,, or in an open inventory<br/>
&gt;slot ,,, plus all the money on the corpse ,,,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was pk&#39;ed by what is called a &quot;naked mage&quot;     actually a Dark Elf wizard<br/>
&gt;,,,  they carry absolutely nothing on them ,, and bag all the loot that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;get ,, if I were to kill him ,,,  if I could kill him,,, all I would get is<br/>
&gt;what gold he took off my corpse ,,,  never get my tunic back ,,,  I died at<br/>
&gt;the entrance to HHP in kith woods ,, my spawn point was just inside the HHP<br/>
&gt;zone ,, I was hunting orcs ,,  by the time I made it back ,,,  just about<br/>
 </span></blockquote>30<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;seconds ,,, the brigand had enough time to loot my corpse and gate out ,,,,<br/>
&gt;oh well ,,,  a new tunic will cost me a total of 5pp to get ,,,,  just the<br/>
&gt;fact that it happened ,,,  that&#39;s not race war roleplaying ,,, that&#39;s pure<br/>
&gt;greed ,,,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i&#39;m sorry ,, this really isn&#39;t the forum for this discussion ,, but I tend<br/>
&gt;to ramble<br/>
