<b>Subject:</b> [OT] Nvidia Drivers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556569037">Sorry for the OT to everyone who DOESN&#39;T use an Nvidia card - but there was<br/>
a discussion here earlier - so I wanted to give a heads-up to those who do.<br/>
<br/>
	Nvidia recently released their Detonator 3 Driver (version 6.18 - man their<br/>
numbering scheme leads to confusion).  Until this update I never had a<br/>
driver-related problem in EQ - (even with SB-Live that a lot of people have<br/>
had problems with).<br/>
<br/>
	Once I installed 6.18 and went into EQ - it locked up.  The first time - I<br/>
tried switching from weaps to Drum - and it locked when I put the drum in<br/>
the appropriate hand slot.  Rebooted, came back to EQ.  Then did a tell or<br/>
two - and as soon as I tried to move forward - locked again.<br/>
<br/>
	I had to revert to previous drivers (5.33) and no problems.  Beware<br/>
upgrading drivers...<br/>
