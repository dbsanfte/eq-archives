<div id="ygrps-yiv-959419874">Memorize the Jig O Vigor and start peddling!  I&#39;ve swum from just that very<br/>
spot, drunk and fell overboard myself.  Best start swimming, hit autorun and<br/>
sit back and eat some raman.  Perhaps you&#39;ll get lucky and someone will come<br/>
to hunt there.  Try calling out to people to get the LOC of a dock, then<br/>
head for it.  Now truthfully, you shouldn&#39;t be that far from the first dock<br/>
at all.  Unless you swim past it.<br/>
