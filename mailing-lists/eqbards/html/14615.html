<div id="ygrps-yiv-580148899">Here is the part I think he is referring to.  I would interpret it somewhat<br/>
differently.   I dont read &quot;never&quot; in here - just that it will take a lot<br/>
longer in real time.<br/>

<br/>
First, throw the statement about &quot;kOOL dOOds&quot; and power-gamers out the<br/>
window. One has nothing to do with the other. People who put forth similar<br/>
effort should reap similar reward. Does that mean that the guy who plays 15<br/>
hours a day will get his armor before the guy who plays 10 hours per week?<br/>
Probably. Should it be any different? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some people talk about wanting us to put up a &quot;Casual Gamers&quot;<br/>
server. They have different ideas about how to go about this, but the end<br/>
result is a server where it&#39;s about 5 times easier to advance and obtain<br/>
items in roughly a quarter of the time. We will *not* be doing anything like<br/>
this. Part of what makes EverQuest what it is is the difficulty and<br/>
challenge involved in advancing in the game. Making a server where we<br/>
purposely trivialize this challenge would go against everything we believe<br/>
about these games.<br/>

&gt; Unfortunately the answer to your problem is not going to make you happy.<br/>
&gt; Abashi responded to a similar question today. In a nutshell, if you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t play 12 hours a day, the high end stuff isnt for you, and that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; they way they planned it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think you missed the point he was trying to make.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A lot of EQ players, for whatever reason, are not high enough level yet<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go on a dragon raid.  As it stands right now on most servers, you have<br/>
