<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010187636">Besides...&quot;twisting&quot; 5-8 songs isn&#39;t complicated, it&#39;s button mashing with,<br/>
at best dubious, results.<br/>
<br/>
Twisting in quotes, because that isn&#39;t twisting.  Talies, I don&#39;t have the<br/>
FAQ handy, so I don&#39;t know if you defined twisting, but I propose it be<br/>
added, if the majority here agree.  That way, we can ridicule bard twinks<br/>
who claim to be able to twist with a document to back us up.  :)  There&#39;s<br/>
that rogue side of me...hey, who else thinks bards should get a limited<br/>
backstab ability??  :)<br/>
<br/>
On an unrelated note, I&#39;ve seen Briliana online lately...you still lurking<br/>
here?  :)  /wave<br/>

Hope youre wife actaully LIKES you telling ...errr... showing her how to<br/>
play.<br/>
I think for someone who picks on everyone else&#39;s overgeneralizations that<br/>
you&#39;re making a pretty big one there yourself, Kaz.<br/>
