<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073430991">That does suck, I&#39;d be pretty upset if I was accused of cheating because that&#39;s<br/>
the mindset.<br/>
<br/>
Even sadder is that if they expect that 90 percent of us will damage the game or<br/>
other players if given a chance...they&#39;d be too close to the mark for comfort.<br/>
<br/>
I pine for the days of Beta (pre p4), where the vast majority of players were<br/>
just excited to be there, and each one was as clever and helpful as possible.<br/>
<br/>
But on the plus side, I&#39;m a Bard :)<br/>
