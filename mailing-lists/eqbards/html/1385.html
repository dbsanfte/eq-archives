&gt;<br/>
&gt;For my first bank, I have two inventory slots and two melee slots macroed so<br/>
&gt;I quickly switch from weapon/shield to an instrument if the situation calls<br/>
&gt;for it.  I have hot-keyed Sense Heading and Foraging to take up the other<br/>
&gt;two slots.  I hotkeyed Sense Heading so when I am fleeing I dont have to<br/>
&gt;worry about switching macro banks.  I have Foraging hotkeyed so I can<br/>
&gt;continually click on it in between combats.    <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t worried about macroing songs because I can click on them with my<br/>
&gt;mouse just as easy as hitting the hotkey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m beginning to think that I should place /assist on my main macro bank but<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t like the idea of moving Sense Heading or Forage to another bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How does everyone else have their hotkeys setup?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I would have to say that after a certain point, Sense heading is no<br/>
longer important, however, I would never recommend that you trade out,<br/>
simply because the mental confusion in remapping *those* two keys ;)  I<br/>
personally have four songs mapped on my first bank, plus forage/sense<br/>
heading.  The four I keep are my group combat buff, Hymn, Selo&#39;s and<br/>
Bellow.  Those are my most twistable songs, I&#39;ve found.  On my other banks<br/>
I have things like Run, Sit, Camp, /Corpse,  and other handy dandies.  If<br/>
you&#39;re wondering why those are on there, it&#39;s because I play full-screen,<br/>
and don&#39;t have the key-bank on the right side.  I like the increased<br/>
visibility the full-screen model gives me.  Plus it makes the game seem<br/>
more immersive.<br/>
Personally, if you already have your bank set up in a way that works, then<br/>
don&#39;t bother with the /assist key - just remember /ass - and you&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
