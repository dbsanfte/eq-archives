<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-986180230">A week or two ago, someone posted an &quot;exploit&quot; where you could<br/>
use the level 42 song to kill yourself without losing<br/>
experience.  Looks like they fixed it without fixing the bug in<br/>
the song:<br/>
<br/>
October 20th, 8:00am&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
The Following enhancements have been made with the update:<br/>
<br/>
*General Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
- If a user is killed due to self-inflicted spell or melee<br/>
damage, experience will be lost.<br/>
- When using a levitation spell, players are now vulnerable to<br/>
attack from both waterbound and landbound creatures.<br/>
- A number of enhancements have been made to balance the class<br/>
specific armor quests implemented last week.<br/>
- A bug was resolved which resulted in a quest reward not being<br/>
given approximately 1 percent of the time. - This has been<br/>
fixed.<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
Spirit Cap has been made slightly more mana-efficent.<br/>
<br/>
*Announcements*<br/>
<br/>
Transfer of Accounts and in-game Properties (Ebay, etc.)<br/>
This is a reminder that, as per the EverQuest License Agreement,<br/>
ownership transfer of accounts, characters, items (except for<br/>
in-game trading/selling/buying), and any other game related<br/>
properties are expressly forbidden.    Doing so is in violation<br/>
of the License, done at your own risk, and we (989 Studios/Sony<br/>
Online Entertainment/Verant) are not responsible for any issues<br/>
resulting from such a transaction, including but not limited to<br/>
fraud, sales of banned or suspended characters, purchased<br/>
character&#39;s bad reputations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
High Risk Areas and Corpse Retrievals<br/>
This is a reminder that the following zones/encounter types are<br/>
high risk and may result in irretrievable corpses:  The Plane of<br/>
Fear, Dragon Encounters (Vox/Nagafen), and the forthcoming<br/>
zones, the Plane of Hate and the Plane of Sky.  Should members<br/>
of your party fall in battle it may be extremely difficult, if<br/>
not impossible, to recover their corpses (for example, they<br/>
might be at the feet of a big red dragon).  GMs and Guides can<br/>
only help with Corpse Retrievals if there is a bug involved, and<br/>
while this is true for all areas in the game, because of the<br/>
extreme danger of the Planes and Dragon Encounters, we felt it<br/>
important to remind our players of these issues.<br/>
<br/>
NPC Spawning Issues<br/>
This is a reminder that some NPCs are part of what we call<br/>
&#39;encounter tables&#39;, in which only one encounter (NPC(s)) are<br/>
present at any given time.  Thus, while searching for rare and<br/>
hidden NPCs throughout the world, it may be necessarily to slay<br/>
common NPCs in the area you are searching in order to get the<br/>
rare NPC to appear.<br/>
