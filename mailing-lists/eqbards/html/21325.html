<div id="ygrps-yiv-122995541">Yep and as much as I hate to say it, I&#39;ve given up on<br/>
my bard.  I&#39;m so tired of fighting with Verant over<br/>
this.  I just tested lullaby yesterday.  36% resist<br/>
rate on a_snake, 40% resist rate an orc centurion. <br/>
I&#39;m 41 level higher and 33 levels higher respectively.<br/>
 I just can&#39;t believe they expect us to accept this.<br/>
<br/>
Like most others, I doubt I will buy anything else<br/>
from Verant.  Sure I&#39;ll give StarWars online a shot<br/>
but EQ2, no.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve started an Enchanter.  She&#39;s 6th now.  I have 4<br/>
friends dedicated to powerleveling her.  I&#39;m tired of<br/>
fighting them so I give up.  When AO comes out, I&#39;ll<br/>
be one less player in EQ.  Till then, I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
follow the vision like a good little customer.<br/>
<br/>
To those of you that stay and fight for changes to the<br/>
bardic class, I wish you all the luck in the world. <br/>
You will be fighting a company that either doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand you or is unwilling to make changes for the<br/>
better.  <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m sure that&#39;s now &quot;as intended&quot; as well.  What a<br/>
&gt;load of BS.  This game has become EnchanterQuest,<br/>
&gt;since at higher levels that&#39;s what you do.  Quest<br/>
&gt;about looking for an Enchanter so you can fight more<br/>
&gt;than two mobs at a time underground.<br/>
