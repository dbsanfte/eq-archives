<b>Subject:</b> Anyone near 28 in Kunark? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194341564">Finally made 28 last night in Cazic. I had never been, having no interest in<br/>
waiting lists and such. But things are very different now with everyone<br/>
gone, I was in high demand *grin*. I joined a Throne Room group and quickly<br/>
died. Seems the healers didn&#39;t really know about Bard hate and the first<br/>
multi pull I got smacked. Had a little Come To Jesus Meetin in group say on<br/>
my way back, and after some group changes (including the Enchanter leader<br/>
who, if she had been doing her job would have been out-taunting me :o)<br/>
everything went fine. Got 28th and a bit of safety exp (yay! Staff now procs<br/>
Chaotic Feedback!).<br/>
<br/>
I was planning on going after an Obsidian shard next, but with reports of<br/>
the stuff being found in Kunark I decided to head there and see if I can do<br/>
as well or better. Headed to Kelethin and bought Pixie Strike,<br/>
then....boarded the shuttle to Kunark. The boat, oh my goodness, all I could<br/>
think of to say in guildsay was &quot;um, wow&quot;. And, it seems it is possible to<br/>
fall through the boat right at the ramp part, which I did *grin*<br/>
(Accelerondo has some culpability in the equasion).<br/>
<br/>
Now, it&#39;s 3AM, I don&#39;t expect much in the way of official help. So I swim to<br/>
the shore and petition for help. I don&#39;t at ALL mind exploring but I was<br/>
tired and just wanted to log out. However, I got hooked by the swaying of<br/>
the trees, the wonderful (empty) ruins and seeing a mountain, I did what I<br/>
instinctivly do in real life , I climbed it...to find a HUGE Iskar statue,<br/>
arm outstreched with palm up, clearly telling all who would listen to return<br/>
home. The sky seemed (er, was) close and I was lost in the beauty when ,<br/>
Guide (or GM, I didn&#39;t check) Gourmand came to my assistance and summoned me<br/>
to FV. *cheers* Nice fellow as well, which was great after my last Guide<br/>
experience.<br/>
I camped on the docks, Ready to start my exploration. I can&#39;t wait.<br/>
<br/>
So! Anyone have suggestions of where to go? I look forward to exploring, but<br/>
I have no aversion to level specific spoilers :o)<br/>
