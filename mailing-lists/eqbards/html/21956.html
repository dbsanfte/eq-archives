<div id="ygrps-yiv-757228569">Not sure.  I would just charm the mob and then it would do nothing but whack<br/>
on me.  Very amusing for wizards.  I could charm it and have it chase me<br/>
around after it broke charm and no one would get hit, they could happily<br/>
stand at center circle and nuke it to death or med as needed.<br/>

Yea, I like to help newbies as I cruise through the zones if it looks like <br/>
they need the help. I&#39;m usually able to taunt the mob off with using just <br/>
&quot;chains&quot;, but worse comes to worse, I just throw in a screech and keep <br/>
chaining for them.<br/>
<br/>
Charm definitely is the best taunt, but it could be confusing for the <br/>
newbie. Are you still able to whack a mob to an inch of it life, charm, <br/>
then have the newbie get exp? I never tried this, but I do like to keep up <br/>
on the possibilities.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Very true. So they have 1 mob that is pissed off at them instead of 4-5<br/>
&gt;other ones to beat on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, the taunt factor is so high after being mezzed like 30 times by your<br/>
&gt;friendly neighborhood bard, that they ignore the little newbie poking them<br/>
&gt;for like 5-6 pts and take swings at the big mean bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve run through zones seeing newbies fighting something that must have<br/>
&gt;been yellow to them (like bandits in West Karanas) and will sit and just<br/>
&gt;&quot;chain&quot; the creature for them. The taunt from chain alone keeps the mob on<br/>
&gt;me while they whack away wildly.<br/>
