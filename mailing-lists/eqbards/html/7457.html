&gt; it is seriously <br/>
&gt; distressing to me when I die a few times (argh!) and lose a <br/>
&gt; weeks&#39; work.<br/>
<br/>

reduced by quite a bit.  above level 30, i would lose anywhere from 1/2 to<br/>
1/4 what i used to.  that to me is more a time saver than running across a<br/>
few zones.  you can have one or the other, bind or MUCH less experience<br/>
loss.  i am happy with what they did.  i can&#39;t speak for everyone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and the other classes also have many abilities that casters can not match.<br/>
it&#39;s a decision that has to be made by us all.<br/>
