<b>Subject:</b> [eqbard]  New song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634909039">How about a song that gives a standard D&D bard ability.  The make money<br/>
song.  Before the torrid flames come roaring in, hear me out.<br/>
<br/>
First, it makes sense, we sing a little song, people pay to hear it. <br/>
This is a normal thing.  I find if odd that bards have no real ability<br/>
that PC&#39;s will pay for (like most casters do).<br/>
<br/>
Make it a long recycle time, like beg. It needs to be resung (so you<br/>
cant leave it on all night).<br/>
<br/>
The money you make (like most of our songs) is based on CHA/faction and<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense, would help out and could lead to some better stuff.<br/>
If they decide to make a defining bard quest (liek soulfire for the<br/>
paladin), perhaps a drum that is a decent 1HB weapon (Tom Toms of<br/>
Terror), then the quest could be kicked off by performing the Money Song<br/>
for a certain NPC.  <br/>
<br/>
Another cool thing would be to give us a cool animation for this, thus<br/>
maybe even some PC&#39;s with money to waste will pay to see it :)<br/>
