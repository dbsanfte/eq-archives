<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325705568">I think you got lucky, had a very sympathetic GM, or are a really good<br/>
talker. I&#39;ve heard from Beta friends that this particular double standard<br/>
was implemented back in beta because some spellcasters were levitating<br/>
themselves, running off the nearest cliff, and shelling mobs with direct<br/>
damage spells from what effectively constituted as a &#39;safe zone&#39;. To fix<br/>
this they enabled mobs to attack you across any vertical distance.<br/>
	I suppose there could be two additional solutions to correct this<br/>
inconsistency.<br/>
<br/>
	1. Disallow casting when levitated. Nah. That would totally screw over<br/>
casters in the plane of Air as I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
	2. Allow players to attack mobs across any vertical distance. Possible,<br/>
even if it is not really realistic. Imagine a warrior on the ground<br/>
underneath the Aviak Village in South Karana hitting aviaks up in the<br/>
highest building. =/<br/>

	Good Journey,<br/>

8)You should be able to.  I got killed by a lizard judicator<br/>
8)swimming above<br/>
8)the surface of the avatar room in cazic while i was<br/>
8)underneath.  i convinced<br/>
8)the GM it was a bug and got ressed.<br/>

8)&gt; The only possible detrimental effect I see of levitate is if you are<br/>
8)&gt; swimming, and suddenly levitated, wouldn&#39;t you pop to the<br/>
8)&gt; surface?  Since<br/>
8)&gt; EQ apparently has a major problem with distinguishing<br/>
8)&gt; vertical difference,<br/>
8)&gt; any creature on the bottom of the ocean can attack you as<br/>
8)&gt; though you were<br/>
8)&gt; standing on it&#39;s head.  Very annoying, because that means<br/>
8)&gt; that you can&#39;t<br/>
8)&gt; attack it, but it can attack you.  *ahem* Nice double standard here,<br/>
8)&gt; programmers.  Can I report a death like that as a bug, since<br/>
8)&gt; obviously, the<br/>
8)&gt; monsters are exploiting it...<br/>
