<div id="ygrps-yiv-678296485">which is what i did exactly (swim past dock).  another problem to watch for, as<br/>
i found out, even though it looks as if you are swimming, keep checking the<br/>
/loc.  I thought i was going forward for 20 mins only to realize stupidly that i<br/>
was paddling against the server wall.  Be sure to call out for the loc of the<br/>
docks and dont worry if your yellow bar goes all the way down, you can&#39;t drown<br/>
from swimming as long as you stay on top of the water.<br/>

&gt; head for it.  Now truthfully, you shouldn&#39;t be that far from the first dock<br/>
&gt; at all.  Unless you swim past it.<br/>
