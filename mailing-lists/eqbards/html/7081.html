<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148984394">What I would like to know... <br/>
<br/>
If you are one of the good aligned races and are agnostic or don&#39;t have a<br/>
religion that very objectionable, are there ways to raise your faction such<br/>
that you could get into Neriak, Grobb or Ogguk?<br/>
<br/>
I see DE&#39;s that have raised their faction and can move around fairly well in<br/>
good cities.  Is it possible to get into their cities?  And not be KOS by<br/>
everyone?<br/>
<br/>
I have been grouped with evil ones like an oger or troll and seen a merchant<br/>
attack them - in Kithikor wood for example  - and if my songs are playing<br/>
and effecting my evil partner, the merchants will chase me too!<br/>
<br/>
And how is one supposed to know what the impact of choosing the different<br/>
religions will be?  I picked Rodcet Nife because it seemed to be a good<br/>
philosophy of helping people.  But if the cellophane is still on the box and<br/>
you are creating your first character - how are you supposed to know which<br/>
ones to choose? <br/>
