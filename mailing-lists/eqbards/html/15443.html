<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484998465">Oh really?<br/>
<br/>
I looted one of these - at least I think we are talking about the same<br/>
thing:<br/>
<br/>
A burnt sash - LORE ITEM NO DROP - WT 0.5 - none/none<br/>
<br/>
Off a an imp - I think - we were camping DB room and got trained or we<br/>
pulled some from the way to the efreeti. Any how since it looked like the<br/>
FBSS, I looted it and still have it.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm a bard that selos thru Rathe Mts?  Guess i will need to go have a<br/>
look-see.<br/>

&gt; hey gang =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I camped Efreeti tonight with some friends (1 efreet, million PHes *YAWN*)<br/>
&gt; and got a burning sash LORE/NO DROP ALL/ALL no stats from an imp<br/>
protector.<br/>
&gt; I have no idea what this item is for, and i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s been added<br/>
&gt; recently (maybe as recent as the latest patch) because I haven&#39;t been to<br/>
&gt; efreeti in months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I told a friend about it and he said he has heard it may be part of a bard<br/>
&gt; quest. He referred me to another mutual acquaintance that is big into<br/>
&gt; questing. This person told me he saw an NPC bard zooming around Rathe Mt<br/>
&gt; yesterday using selo&#39;s (I&#39;ve never ever seen an NPC bard using songs so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really know what to think). He said the NPC said something about a<br/>
&gt; &quot;burning&quot; something or other and he thinks the sash may have something to<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; with a quest (hopefuly) for bards. He also thinks this NPC was added as<br/>
&gt; recently as the latest patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone knows anything about this please post info - i&#39;m sure the bardic<br/>
&gt; community would appreciate it.<br/>
