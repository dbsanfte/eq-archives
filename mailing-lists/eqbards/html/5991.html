<br/>
This is sort of bard-related, insofar as we are explorers (ok, I&#39;m <br/>
stretching here, yeah, this is off-topic).<br/>
<br/>
Some trees are sloped just slightly... if you treat them like a ladder and <br/>
just move slowly, you can climb up them.  Some of the best ones for this <br/>
purpose are the old pine trees like they have in Freeport... few branches to <br/>
get in the way, and a long-straight trunk which is tilted about 5-10 degrees <br/>
from vertical.  You&#39;ll find two good trees to practice on in West <br/>
Freeport...  one by Hogcaller&#39;s Inn and the other by the monk&#39;s guild.  Both <br/>
of these trees are high enough to get you onto either roofs or walls.  You <br/>
can also climb the apple trees (shorter trees with fluffy boughs) found <br/>
throughout Antonica.  The old-growth pines in Faydwer are tougher to climb, <br/>
as most of them have vertical trunks, at least at the base.<br/>
<br/>
I first figured this out when I observed monsters (inadvertently I assume) <br/>
climbing due to pathing errors.  I reasoned, if they can do it, why can&#39;t I? <br/>
  Following this reasoning, I am still trying to learn to attack through <br/>
walls... but that&#39;s another topic. = )<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, you can climb just about anything sloped... wizzie <br/>
teleport ruins such as those in Greater Faydark and North Karana are <br/>
particularly fun, though WATCH YOUR STEP!  Moving with Selo&#39;s, you will find <br/>
it is extremely difficult to climb back down without falling.<br/>
<br/>
/em laughs at YOU for 145 points of damage!<br/>
<br/>
May your feet ever be fleet,<br/>
And your voices ever be sweet<br/>
