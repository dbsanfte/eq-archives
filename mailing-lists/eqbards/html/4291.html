<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076684874">Right now i use a crystalline blade in primary slot and silvery war axe in<br/>
secondary.  in the bank is a dragoon dirk, demon claws, and staff of<br/>
writhing.  on my wish list is a short sword of the ykesha, but i keep going<br/>
and losing the lotto as usual.  would love a wakizishi but never get anyone<br/>
to camp for the quest items.  sorry to whine hehehe.<br/>
