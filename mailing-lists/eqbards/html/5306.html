<div id="ygrps-yiv-156470506">I started 11 different characters on Tunare (call me fickle) and was having<br/>
fun raising my eight favorites when the folks I work/play with asked me to<br/>
to switch with them to Brell Serilis.  They also asked me to please stick to<br/>
one character so I could keep up with them.  (tough for me to do, I like<br/>
variety)<br/>
<br/>
Knowing I had played around with all but two classes, my friends asked which<br/>
one I was going to settle on.  I immediately said &quot;anything but a bard&quot;.<br/>
They found this most amusing because my bard on Tunare was my first<br/>
character and the one I played the most often.  So I went on to complain for<br/>
abit about the twitch factor, and how I have to watch the chat window and<br/>
can&#39;t see the fight, and how easily I die if I have to tank, and how hard it<br/>
is to level, and how every mob hates me, and so on and so on.  Had them in<br/>
stiches discribing our &quot;wince&quot; song.  I forget whether I decided to instead<br/>
go with a rogue, a monk, or a shaman, but when I logged into the server and<br/>
began creating a new character, well, I went with a bard!  Grrr.  Some<br/>
higher force was beckoning me, I swear it!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, now that I&#39;ve gone and bad-mouthed bards to my fellow<br/>
adventurers, they&#39;re all looking at my character as the weak link in the<br/>
group.  I&#39;d like to impress them with more than just Selo&#39;s.  Any advice for<br/>
the lower levels? Any advice on how best to group with a cleric, wizard, and<br/>
warrior?  I&#39;m at level 5 now and will probably join the wizard right away.<br/>
I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be joined by the warrior or cleric until level 8 or so<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
