<div id="ygrps-yiv-778524674">My guild went to Plane of Hate yesterday (Monday).  A friend of mine ran <br/>
me in since I was work-delayed, so I logged in an hour or so into the <br/>
raid.  At the time, I had four pieces of visible blue Lambent:  arms, <br/>
legs, chest, head.  There were two Bards up there; the senior Bard (Jysa) <br/>
had all of her Imbrued already.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I logged on, one of our pullers handed me some vambraces.  I <br/>
looked:  Singing Steel!  They&#39;d found it in Sebilis the night before and <br/>
decided to give it to me!  I&#39;d heard them talking about that in /guildsay <br/>
the night before, but I honestly thought they were yanking my chain.<br/>
<br/>
An hour in, some warrior greaves dropped.  The warrior who got them had <br/>
some guild-owned Mithril Greaves; my guild decided to give them to me, <br/>
also!  The AC is less than Lambent, but I&#39;ve been sorely lacking in the <br/>
STR department, so this was a welcome addition.<br/>
<br/>
We killed Innoruuk (I went LD, even though I was staring at the corner), <br/>
then Maestro (the Lute rotted, since both Bards there had one), and <br/>
went back to the west camp.  A few more Scorn Banshees and what dropped? <br/>
A Bard Helm!<br/>
<br/>
Another hour or so, another Scorn Banshee.  What dropped?  A Bard BP!<br/>
<br/>
So I went from mostly blue to no blue at all in about four hours.  Pretty <br/>
nice day for me, I&#39;d say!  Pretty nice day for the guild as a whole, <br/>
too.  We got about 35 drops up there total, including 4 BP/Robes (Shaman, <br/>
Bard, Mage, Enchanter).<br/>
