<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954217397">Bard invis works really great in Unrest and Mistmoore vs. undead and<br/>
living (although Mistmoore is a strange case, certain monsters are<br/>
affected by Undead spells, but Camo can move by them, hmm) but as<br/>
Benjamin said it no longer works in Lower Guk on Undead.<br/>
Another weird thing is that bard invis doesn&#39;t work on greater Kobolds<br/>
in Solusek B (35+ dungeon basically) but you can go all the way to the<br/>
frogluk king on Live side Lower Guk with it, and unless a shaman froggie<br/>
has see invis on you are fine. You can actually stand there admiring the<br/>
bok&#39;s and frog king (although I&#39;d recommend being careful, in case it<br/>
blinked ;)). If I&#39;m not mistaken (and I could be), our invis used to<br/>
work against Undead in Lower Guk Undead side, and was changed in a patch<br/>
a few months ago. This was even before they fixed Selo&#39;s overwriting<br/>
Spirit of Wolf.<br/>
