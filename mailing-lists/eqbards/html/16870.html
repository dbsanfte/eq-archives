<div id="ygrps-yiv-11394260">CHANGE CHANGE CHANGE<br/>
<br/>
Some of these songs are ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Level 51:<br/>
- Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding -<br/>
decrease AC from 16 to 18; Decrease Attack Speed between 30% to 35%;<br/>
Decrease Movement between 52% and 61%; Decrease AGI from 45 to 50<br/>
<br/>
They forgot to add INCREASE resist rate by 90%. Does anyone think this song<br/>
will EVER stick?<br/>
<br/>
Level 54:<br/>
- Selo&#39;s Assonait Strane -<br/>
Decrease movement between 43% and 45%; Decrease Attack Speed for between 23%<br/>
to 25%<br/>
<br/>
Um, Didn&#39;t they just give us a song that was better in every way?<br/>
<br/>
Compare<br/>
===============================<br/>
Movement Debuf:     52% (Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding) vs 43% (Selo&#39;s Assonait<br/>
Strane)<br/>
Attack Speed Debuf: 30% (Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding) vs 23% (Selo&#39;s Assonait<br/>
Strane)<br/>
<br/>
If they expect Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding to ever stick, why give us this<br/>
completely useless song? Is there ever a situation where we would not want<br/>
the -16 ac or -45 agi?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Level 57:<br/>
- McVaxius&#39; Rousing X -<br/>
Increase Attack Speed for Between 21% to 22%; Strength - Unknown formula;<br/>
Increase ATK from 13 to 14; Damage shield by 8<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, I&#39;m not level 50 yet, so I don&#39;t know how good Verses of Victory is,<br/>
but it seems like it would be a better choice.<br/>
<br/>
Compare:<br/>
==============================<br/>
Attack Speed Buff: 21% (McVaxius&#39; Rousing X) vs 25% (Verses of Victory)<br/>
Str Buff:          + x (McVaxius&#39; Rousing X) vs +30 (Verses of Victory)<br/>
<br/>
Hard to judge without seeing the exact str buff of McVaxius&#39; but if it isn&#39;t<br/>
at least 18, then it isn&#39;t competitive with VoV. Not to mention that ViV has<br/>
+20 ac and +30 agi (to balance with a rather meager 8 damage shield)<br/>
<br/>
Level 58:<br/>
- Niv&#39;s Harmonic X -<br/>
Increase AC by 24<br/>
<br/>
Boring? Guardian Rythmns at level 17 is +3 ac (sans drum), at level 36 is +6<br/>
ac (sans drum). I don&#39;t have figures on level 50, but we can probably<br/>
reasonably extrapolate the ac to be +9 (sans drum). Now I ask you, is +11 ac<br/>
worth giving up +30 vs magic?<br/>
<br/>
Level 59:<br/>
- Solon&#39;s Charsimatic Concord -<br/>
Increase Charisma by 45<br/>
<br/>
This seems a bit weak also, given that for all intensive purposes, only<br/>
bards will benefit from this in combat (most enchanters have thier cha in<br/>
the 180s-200s at level 50). Seeing as how we can&#39;t charm mobs above level 37<br/>
with no charm upgrade and there is no mez upgrade, how often will this see<br/>
play?<br/>
<br/>
Level 60:<br/>
????<br/>
<br/>
Are we to assume that this is being left blank to allow for expansion? Ok,<br/>
so that was probably a bit premature. I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the<br/>
doubt till the expansion is released.<br/>
