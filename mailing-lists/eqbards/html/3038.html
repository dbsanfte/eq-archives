&gt;Well these are the connections that I am using, my cable modem connection<br/>
&gt;is unreliable at times.  From what I have noticed the higher the<br/>
&gt;packet loss % or the higher the amount of incoming data will affect my<br/>
&gt;ability to Twist.  Situations like standing in a room where<br/>
&gt;three parties are in combat results in a large amount incoming data.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well down to the connections<br/>
&gt;cable modem - Rogers@Home<br/>
&gt;Globalserve - 28.8K Modem<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Surprisingly the modem gives me better packet loss percentage, while the<br/>
&gt;cable modem gives me better ping time and over all lower bursting data.<br/>
&gt;My preferenece would be the modem if it were not for the low speed =(. <br/>

<br/>
I had to switch ISP&#39;s and I&#39;m getting 250-300 ping now, where<br/>
on the old one I was getting 180-225.  (unfortunately I was <br/>
having trouble just getting connected to the old one)</div>
