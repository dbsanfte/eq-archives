<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567366420">On a happier note I did some testing of Accelerando last nite vs. Root.<br/>
This was prompted because prior to the patch I had made the following<br/>
observation accidentally in Kithicor.  <br/>
<br/>
I was running across the zone when a skeleton of some description rooted me.<br/>
Accelerando was up and running and of course I stuck in place.  Since the<br/>
Mob wasn&#39;t advancing I quickly switched to twisting the two MR songs I had<br/>
memmed to hopefully resist some spells until Root wore of.  Two pulses later<br/>
when I got the &quot;you slow down&quot; message from Accelerando running out I was<br/>
free!  Even though I had the Root icon clearly on the screen I was able to<br/>
run to the zone.  Immediately on the other side of the zone I was Rooted for<br/>
several minutes.  I tested this again before yesterday&#39;s patch and the<br/>
pattern held, Accelerando, if it was on when the Root stuck, would break the<br/>
Root when it wore off.<br/>
<br/>
After the patch this has again changed.  Last nite I tested some more to see<br/>
what other change had been made.  If you are Rooted and Accelerando is not<br/>
up, it will not break it.  If Accelerando is running when you get Rooted<br/>
however, the very first &quot;Your feet move faster&quot; pulse message will break you<br/>
free.  This happened every time I tried it, both with Root and Ghoul Root.<br/>
The icon remained on the screen and moving to a new zone caused the Root<br/>
icon to again take hold.  <br/>
For now, as long as Accelerando is running when you get Rooted, relax.  At<br/>
the next pulse you should (to use Verant&#39;s wording despite my actual real<br/>
testing) be able to move freely.  If Accelerando goes down though you will<br/>
not be able to restart it.  If you zone with that Root icon still on your<br/>
screen, expect to be Rooted on the other side.<br/>
