 </span></blockquote>     I have a lot of fun, but I still complain about the binding issue.  To<br/>
me it&#39;s more of a balancing issue than anything else.<br/>
     Also, here&#39;s a question for the folks that are against any change in<br/>
binding:  If there were a change (whether it&#39;s bards able to bind, everyone<br/>
gets self-bind, anyone can be bound in any zone, etc), woudl you use it or<br/>
keep through the multiple zones to get to your corpse?<br/>
