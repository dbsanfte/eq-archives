&gt; We were under the impression that this was an intended benefit, is this a<br/>
&gt; bug, or has this functionality been intentionally removed?  Also SoW now<br/>
&gt; overrides our song, in effect cancelling it out.  Many bards have already<br/>
&gt; complained about having SoW intentionally cast on them as a form of<br/>
&gt; harassment.  Are there any plans to A) make SoW removable by clicking on it<br/>
&gt; as was recently done for levetate, or B) make it so that Selo&#39;s overrides<br/>
&gt; SoW, but when Selo&#39;s wears off, or goes out of range, SoW will continue to<br/>
&gt; work.  When could we expect such a change to occur?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really a bit worried about this one. My problem with it is that<br/>
their history shows that complaints like this result in an even more<br/>
annoying quick fix. A classic example is the change to invisibility.<br/>
People used to cast it on pet owners to make the pet vanish. Verant&#39;s<br/>
response was to make invisible only castable on a group member. If they<br/>
did this to SoW it would be an incredible pain in the butt for everyone<br/>
in the game, as then to SoW some poor guy running back across 5 zones to<br/>
his corpse, he&#39;d have to be grouped then ungrouped. I wish there was<br/>
some way to convince Verant to fix it the right way. i.e. Selo&#39;s<br/>
overrides SoW as it did, but when it wears off, SoW&#39;s speed is correctly<br/>
reset without the need to zone to fix it.<br/>
