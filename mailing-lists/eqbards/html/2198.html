<div id="ygrps-yiv-599208247">Unfortunately this is because almost everyone turns off OOC because it is<br/>
usually a regular Spam-A-Rama going on on the OOC network.<br/>
<br/>
I know my party had it turned off before 3rd level because of the annoyance<br/>
and foul language.<br/>
<br/>
Use shout once, then start doing a /who 9 11 and then sending them private<br/>
tells, &quot;Hey need a bard in your party?&quot;  or &quot;Wanna team up with a 9th level<br/>
bard, I can heal, I can do AoE Damage, we can outrun monsters, we can make<br/>
sweet beautiful music together&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or something else like that.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lately, I&#39;m having serious trouble finding a group. I&#39;m a level 10 bard on<br/>
&gt; Tarew Marr. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting in Steamfront Mountains. I&#39;m always<br/>
&gt; looking for a group to hunt mino&#39;s (great exp, and their axes sell for 4pp<br/>
&gt; to other players). Whenever I do a &quot;/ooc Level 10 Bard looking for a<br/>
&gt; group&quot; I get no response. Even when there are other level 9-11 players in<br/>
&gt; the area. Are we bards no longer a valuable asset in a group? Has anyone<br/>
&gt; experienced this?<br/>
