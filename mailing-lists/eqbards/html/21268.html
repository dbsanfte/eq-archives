<div id="ygrps-yiv-507770900">I just pulled this off of Everlore.  Looks like we were both right, Kit :)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Guys, all the planes are going to get an item upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Several other older dungeons are going to be revamped too.<br/>
<br/>
FA style quests for every class are almost finished and in early testing<br/>
(the weapons look really cool, btw -- I was checking them out today).<br/>
<br/>
And, rumor has it, the FA may very well be upgraded too.<br/>
<br/>
As for Veeshan&#39;s Peak items, I&#39;ll bring up this issue at the next tuning<br/>
meeting.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
<br/>

underway.  They look really cool, too bad my smith is a wood elf, sigh.<br/>

the two though, and some of the new materials for smithing may be required<br/>
in the new weapon quests!<br/>
