&gt;&gt; Something I&#39;ll do is keep some throwing daggers on me. You<br/>
&gt;&gt; can chuck one at your target from just outside his bubble,<br/>
&gt;&gt; that gives you a bit extra time to swap weapons. The cost<br/>
&gt;&gt; of daggers really isn&#39;t that high compared to the loot you<br/>
&gt;&gt; can get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shurikens have a greater range and cost the same.  They do one<br/>
&gt;less damage but the damage from throwing weapons is close to<br/>
&gt;negligible.  They also have a faster recycle time which means<br/>
&gt;you don&#39;t have to wait as long if you get that annoying &quot;you<br/>
&gt;are too close to use a melee weapon&quot; or &quot;that target is out of<br/>
&gt;range&quot; message but still &quot;uses&quot; the weapon in terms of the<br/>
&gt;delay (please everyone, /bug this :-).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Where do you find shurikens?  The monk guild has them, but<br/>
&gt;there are only two of them in all Norrath.  There is another<br/>
&gt;guild that carries them, but I&#39;ll leave it up to you to figure<br/>
&gt;out which one it is.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another alternative to throwing weapons is to start your<br/>
&gt;bellow on the mob, and while the song is &quot;powering up&quot; switch<br/>
&gt;to your weapons.<br/>
