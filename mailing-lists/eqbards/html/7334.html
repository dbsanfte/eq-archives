<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811430626">I have made similar observations and had an even worse problem in unrest. I<br/>
was with 2 paladins, a shaman, and myself when a red carrion ghoul got a<br/>
hold of me. This happened the day of the last patch so I was quite unaware<br/>
anything was going to happen. The ghoul cast root on me so I instantly<br/>
whipped out Selo&#39;s and couldn&#39;t move. The root wore off as I approached my<br/>
last bubble of health and because I had been telling my party that I was<br/>
stuck the shaman cast SOW on me just as I clicked on Selo&#39;s. Needless to say<br/>
I had no speed action whatsoever and died running at a SLOWER than normal<br/>
pace. I was quite pissed off - in fact still am- because our best and in<br/>
fact only defensive mechanism has been broken for what ever reason.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering, and I get the feeling the that this is sorta hopeless, but<br/>
where do we take complaints like this too? I petitioned and reported it as a<br/>
bug but I still feel it all fell on deaf ears.<br/>

Subject: Selo&#39;s Accelerando and Root<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few observations:<br/>
<br/>
I have fought a fair number of ghouls and other rooters in the past 8 levels<br/>
or so, and until the patch before last (i.e. the infamous Selo&#39;s nerf)<br/>
Selo&#39;s ALWAYS broke root, no matter what my level was relative to theirs<br/>
(heck, I remember once when I was 8th level thanking Selo over and over as I<br/>
fled from 2 red ghouls after breaking their root).<br/>
<br/>
When the patch went in, I noticed that I could never break roots with Selo&#39;s<br/>
anymore.  No song text (&quot;your feet fail to move faster!&quot;), no song sprites,<br/>
no effect whatsoever.  No matter the status of my Selo&#39;s at the time the<br/>
root was applied, I was rooted and could not use Selo&#39;s to break it.  This<br/>
held true for green ghouls as well as blue and white.  In fact it was<br/>
identical to what happened if I had SoW cast on me... well, with SoW I could<br/>
still move a little bit, but at a horribly slow crawl... how they live with<br/>
that I will never understand.<br/>
<br/>
Last night in Unrest I ran into some trouble, and was once again unable to<br/>
break roots using Selo&#39;s... I was in a full group with 2 clerics and in the<br/>
first two fights received not ONE heal while the damn monsters made bard<br/>
puree - I actually died within one minute of arrival in Unrest and again<br/>
within one minute of retrieving my corpse, then one more time at the end of<br/>
the evening (in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron), a new record for my worst experience in<br/>
EQ.  Grrrrr... Anyways, twice I was rooted and unable to break it.  Root is<br/>
a bit tricky to test as it is highly variable: sometimes it fails quickly,<br/>
sometimes it holds for the rest of your life. = )<br/>
<br/>
Playing Devil&#39;s Advocate, my PL was horrid, and my screen was full of spells<br/>
going off (smite smite smite HEAL PLEASE smite smite HEAL PLEASE smite HELP!<br/>
smite LOADING PLEASE WAIT), so this may not be a valid test.  If anyone can<br/>
confirm through repeated testing (please observe that a single anecdotal<br/>
example of how you played Selo&#39;s and the root went away is not a valid<br/>
sample) that Selo&#39;s does now break root again, please let us all know.<br/>
Otherwise I think we can safely assume that this is either 1) a bug which<br/>
Verant will fix &quot;someday&quot; (i.e. they want Selo&#39;s to break root, but it<br/>
clearly is not a priority for their programmers), or 2) the way they always<br/>
intended it to be (i.e. Selo&#39;s breaking root was a bug which has been<br/>
fixed).  Since Verant doesn&#39;t talk to us peons, as always we must rely on<br/>
each other to find out how our (or IF) our songs work.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, is there any word on Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody?  Does<br/>
it do anything?  If so, what?  I&#39;d like to hear that someone has tested it<br/>
recently (since the most recent patch is always preferable) and can confirm<br/>
or deny the rumors floating around.<br/>
<br/>
May your feet ever be fleet,<br/>
And your voices ever be sweet<br/>
