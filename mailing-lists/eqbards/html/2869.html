<div id="ygrps-yiv-69949053">Ok, I&#39;ve read a lot on this list about how badly the critters hate us,<br/>
never really experienced it till last night.<br/>
<br/>
I expected it to come from me healing my group - the way it happened was a<br/>
bit of a surprise.<br/>
<br/>
I was showing the group I was with what twisting guardian and protective<br/>
rythms did for their resistance with a drum, and good god - every greater,<br/>
db and barbed skele on our side of unrest was making a beeline for ME!<br/>
<br/>
We probably could have handled it had I known the reaction was gonna be<br/>
like that, and I sure as heck would have run quicker - thankfully, I am the<br/>
only one that died.<br/>
<br/>
I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of NOWHERE - why<br/>
would this act like such a magnet?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I think I&#39;m gonna get a really good group together (one that can<br/>
handle that kind of heat) - and do it purposefully (a little less long) and<br/>
we won&#39;t need to debate on who the puller is anymore - looks like I&#39;m<br/>
nominated as bait.</div>
