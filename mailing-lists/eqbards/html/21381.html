<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630478364">Mana song is what makes us &quot;balanced&quot;, unfortunately.  Here&#39;s how much my <br/>
guild likes the Mana Song:<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in Plane of Sky.  We need Crowd Control, and only have one <br/>
Enchanter, so our level 57 Bard logs onto her friends account to play his <br/>
Enchanter.  So I play her Bard.  So my RL friend (a Cleric), logs <br/>
Kenross (52) onto his second computer, turns on Mana Song, and sets him <br/>
to /follow the Cleric.  Kenross was in the pulling group, too, so he <br/>
actually got exp from it.  With nobody running him.  And not one person <br/>
raised even the smallest objection; this seemed perfectly acceptable.  <br/>
We&#39;ll never get fixed if Mana Song is THAT in demand.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I got to spend the entire day (16 hours) twisting 32 and 55, <br/>
to keep our only 96% rez Cleric, our two Enchanters, and our highest <br/>
Shaman pumped with Mana.  Except during CR, when I got to sing the <br/>
same two songs for five Clerics.  What fun.  The only excitement came <br/>
when I got yelled at for not turning off 55 when the Enchanters wanted to <br/>
cast C2 on the party.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a macro, I could have walked away and had a nap.<br/>
<br/>
And what&#39;s with the Plane of Sky boss MOBs not dropping any loot?<br/>
<br/>
Kenross Cantoforjado, 52 songs<br/>

&gt; You&#39;re right Adon.  The things my friend saw when he told his guild were<br/>
&gt; even worse.  Many casters begged him to stay while the melee and hybrids all<br/>
&gt; told him they understood his frustration.  It nearly killed the guild once<br/>
&gt; it was realized the only reason the casters really wanted him to stay was<br/>
&gt; manasong.  There was talk for a while of breaking up the whole guild<br/>
&gt; basically since all the non-casters threatened to quit.  They already felt<br/>
&gt; like they were treated as second class citizens anyhow since they were<br/>
&gt; outnumbered.<br/>
