<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224408325">Clerics dodge skill caps at 80 so they are better tanks than us probably.<br/>
Especially when you consider their ability to cast Divine Aura and be<br/>
invincible for a brief time.  Sadly enough in my normal group our tanks are<br/>
a monk and a dwarf cleric.  I am considered the group target dummy and<br/>
buffer and usually end up looking like a cheap enchanter with a mace.  The<br/>
dwarf cleric can take far more damage than I can and he is 2 levels lower<br/>
than me.  Divine Aura just makes it even more noticeable.  In truth bards<br/>
are lousy tanks, lousy nukers, and lousy rogues with ok buffs.  But overall<br/>
we are beast at doing everything if you consider things all at once.  Its<br/>
the skill caps that really make this only true up till 17th level or so.<br/>
after that many of our skills will become useless like hide, sneak, etc.  I<br/>
think they are taking the &#39;master of none&#39; part of jack of all trades a<br/>
little too far, but since there are so few bards our voice is small and we<br/>
may never be heard.<br/>

&gt; What other class has had their spell deliberatly placed as<br/>
&gt; lesser value?  Our cancelling SOW was a fluke.. SoW<br/>
&gt; overpowering Accel was not an accident.  And WHY would you<br/>
&gt; prefer SOW to Accel?  Obviously outdoors you would not<br/>
&gt; since Accel is far faster especially as the bard playing<br/>
&gt; grows.  In our desire to not fall into the morrass of me<br/>
<br/>
I really wish they&#39;d just fix this right, and have the game<br/>
check for other active movement spell effects when one<br/>
expires.  If two are in conflict, the faster takes precedence<br/>
(with the exception of root/snare/chain).  If someone has SoW<br/>
on him and a bard in his group plays a faster Accelerando, he<br/>
should get the Accelerando boost.  If he drops out of song<br/>
range, he should drop back down to SoW speed.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would like to see the quest system fixed.. I&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt; see some more special items for bards.  I&#39;d like to see<br/>
<br/>
I too would like to see some more special items.  Right now<br/>
the only bard-specific items are instruments, one of which<br/>
comes from Nagafen the dragon, one which comes from a L30ish<br/>
mob in Mistmoore, and the rest of which are no different from<br/>
store bought instruments.  Oh, and the PoF items, not that any<br/>
bard is going to be getting them soon.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; some more useful songs. And I&#39;ld like to see them stop<br/>
&gt; nerfing us without reguard to the results. I won&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; get into balance, as right now I feel we are underbalanced<br/>
&gt; now and others seem to think we are just fine. Anyway<br/>
<br/>
In terms of balance, I think we&#39;re still pretty well balanced.<br/>
I&#39;d like to see us get either another defensive skill, or the<br/>
cap on dodge raised to 200.  The defensive skills are dodge,<br/>
block, parry, and riposte.  Because we&#39;re not supposed to be<br/>
full tanks, we only get one out of four.  And then for some<br/>
strange reason the one we get is capped at half what the other<br/>
tanks get?  That puts our defensive ability closer to casters<br/>
than to tanks.  In fact I&#39;ll need to ask my cleric friends<br/>
what the cap on their dodge skill is.  I have the sinking<br/>
feeling they&#39;re just as good at tanking as we are (better<br/>
even since they&#39;re usually using a shield).<br/>
