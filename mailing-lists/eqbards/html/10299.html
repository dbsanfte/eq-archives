&gt; The main problem with the majority of our damage songs is they do not give <br/>

average over.  I usually try for at least 10 rounds.  e.g. I<br/>
play Celerity, and time how long it takes to swing 10 times.  <br/>
The only gotcha is that if you&#39;re counting each swing and<br/>
stopping the stopwatch when you say &quot;10,&quot; then you have to<br/>
start counting at 0, not 1.<br/>
