&gt;I know what you mean about the crazy pulls...<br/>
&gt;Was in the Savant room last night (got a BEM yay!), and our group saw all<br/>
&gt;manner of things run past us.  Minos, huge clusters of frogs, and even an<br/>
&gt;EE!  I&#39;m not to well versed on the layout of Lower yet (getting there tho!)<br/>
&gt;but i believe it was the Cavalier group who was pulling.  People like to<br/>
&gt;get a reputation as being a good puller by pulling crap from live side to<br/>
&gt;dead side.  Heck, once I was grouped with a Paly (can&#39;t remember his name)<br/>
&gt;who was a damned good puller.  He bragged that he once pulled something<br/>
&gt;from upper guk! lol!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pulling the live side stuff to the dead side it kinda fun.  One night I was <br/>
in a group in the Hand room and one of the wizards managed to get an eye of <br/>
zom to the live side.  Well the aggro spread to just about everything on the <br/>
live side so when I would be out pulling I would auto-pull live side frogs <br/>
and minos from near the Frenzied room.  It was pretty funny, some of the <br/>
battles got a bit out of control but it was great experience :)<br/>
