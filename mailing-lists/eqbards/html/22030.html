&gt; aren&#39;t impossible, as long as the group knows to unload on the first one to take it out as fast as<br/>
&gt; possible.  Once an area is broken, the MOBs are all single targets, and at that point, what do you need an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter for?  In the cases cited, the Enchanter might make the initial break a bit easier (although not in<br/>
&gt; all cases), but once beyond that point, the Bard is more generically useful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I mean effective as in how many mobs you can pull. I&#39;ve been in the Jail<br/>
area with an enchanter and had our puller pulling from as far back as<br/>
the bartender area because we were easily keeping up with that number of<br/>
mobs. If you are on a crowded server where you could never do that<br/>
without impinging on someone else&#39;s camp then I guess this kind of<br/>
effectiveness is unavailable to you anyway.<br/>
