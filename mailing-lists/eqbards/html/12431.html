<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752891967">And I thought it was just me!  We a shaman&#39;s buffs, MM drums, Elemental and<br/>
Guardians, I can get my MR up to 190+ and my cold and fire to 150+.  I still<br/>
can loose 3/4 of my life in a pull from a damn blue Solusek Mage!  I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten to the point where I don&#39;t bother weaving Guardian and Elemental<br/>
anymore and just stick to elemental without the drum... darn well seems just<br/>
as effective...<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] News on stats from Abashi via EQCaster&#39;s<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This topic has been heatly discussed on the alt.games.everquest newsgroup<br/>
&gt; recently.  A lot of people, especially the shamans, are really<br/>
&gt; disgusted if<br/>
&gt; everything Abashi stated was true.  To sum up what he said in very general<br/>
&gt; terms, DEX and AGI have no impact whatsoever on combat skills like dodge,<br/>
&gt; block, riposte, and parry.  DEX has no impact on improving your chance to<br/>
&gt; get a successful hit.  There was more to his post but DEX and AGI I think<br/>
&gt; are the two stats everyone was primarily complaining about.  One<br/>
&gt; person even<br/>
&gt; posted that for the melee classes, since stats are almost<br/>
&gt; meaningless, EQ is<br/>
&gt; more a first person shooter than a RPG.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If its true that primary stats don&#39;t really affect combat skills<br/>
&gt; that much,<br/>
&gt; I wonder how important resist rates are?  I would really hate to find out<br/>
&gt; that they aren&#39;t important in successfully making a resistance roll as we<br/>
&gt; think they are.  Black helicopter sighting here:  the other night I was in<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore and my party decided to pull a negotiator that was wandering.  I<br/>
&gt; equipped drum and weaved both elemental and guardian rhythms.  That raised<br/>
&gt; my magic resist rate to well over 100.  Myself and three other<br/>
&gt; people in my<br/>
&gt; party still got charmed by the negotiator.  I had told everyone beforehand<br/>
&gt; that I would have both songs up for the entire fight so none of us were<br/>
&gt; likely to get charmed.  To say the least I wasn&#39;t the most<br/>
&gt; popular person in<br/>
&gt; the group after that.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; According to Abashi and reported by EQCasters, stats affect your chances<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; raising your skill level in skills.  Agility increases the chance of<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; a skill raise in dodge is a listed example.  This would seem to greatly<br/>
&gt; &gt; downplay the value of stats once you hit your skill cap in many areas<br/>
&gt; &gt; sadly.<br/>
