&gt;It has recently come to my attention that there are two special instruments <br/>
&gt;that I did not know existed in game.  They are called &quot;Drum of Selo&#39;s March&quot; <br/>
&gt;and &quot;Brahm&#39;s Horn&quot;.  I was wondering if anyone had any information on where <br/>
&gt;these items can be obtained.<br/>
