<div id="ygrps-yiv-829076719">Shada i gotta ask ya, what was your strategy to killing trak? we were<br/>
thinking of sending in air pets first to set off the proc (since they&#39;re<br/>
pretty immune to poison and that will give us 45 seconds free of poison)<br/>
before we send in the troops as our first attempt at him got everyone<br/>
slaughtered. Mind sharing how you guys did it? Even thinking of maybe using<br/>
the cleric spell (lev55) that allows all tanks to get 10hp back each time<br/>
they hit (but duel wielding/quad attacking tanks will get 40hp back per<br/>
round, making them take less dmg overall in the log run). There&#39;s a few<br/>
strategies being worked on right now, but i was wondering if ya could shed<br/>
some light on the subject 8)<br/>
<br/>
Any tips/strategies?<br/>
<br/>
On a funny note, a monk of ours was roaming near trak and got casted on, hit<br/>
once and fd with 25hp, he FD his way to the zone, funny screenshots.<br/>

thanks :)<br/>
<br/>
well he hits for 630 damage, his poison dot does an initial 1500 damage i<br/>
think, plus 150 per tick for 10 ticks.  i have only lived 1 of 8 trak kills<br/>
and i was in FV when i heard about my BP, but it&#39;s a great feeling wearing<br/>
it :)  and now that we can kill Venril Sathir again (last night for the<br/>
first time since he was buffed) i got a chance at legs and a full set of<br/>
singing steel minus the bracer.<br/>

p.s. on our most recent trak raid, much to my shock i learned that a gnome,<br/>
the vile Xaxe, had been admitted into the Powa clan, sworn enemies of the<br/>
evil Keplegrobs and all things gnomish!  it broke my heart to leave the clan<br/>
of which i was so proud, but it was tainted and i could stay no longer.<br/>
