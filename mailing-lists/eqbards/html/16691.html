  blackplate*.jpg     Finally, all black, now I need a longsword and<br/>
                      shield.<br/>
 <br/>
  azarack*.jpg        All angles of the Azarack Island (full, 8 mobs)<br/>
                      Should help analysis of breaking it for those<br/>
                      who haven&#39;t done it yet.<br/>

  eyeofveeshan1.jpg   Found him in PoS, visually it&#39;s a bug, I wonder what<br/>
                      it really should be.<br/>
 <br/>
  fearplane1.jpg      This one is funny as hell.<br/>
<br/>
  quillmane1.jpg      I&#39;ve killed this damn thing many times and all legs<br/>
                      of course until a ranger KS&#39;s then it has a cloak.<br/>
<br/>
  vox*.jpg            Still shots of Vox, not very impressive, but I was<br/>
                      bored.<br/>
<br/>
  cazicthule1.jpg     Had a bunch of shots of him, this was the best.<br/>
<br/>
  wolves1.jpg         Oasis wolf attack.<br/>
<br/>
  I had a screenshot of Bildge when I killed him, but I can&#39;t find it.<br/>
  And I forgot to take one of the named rat in DC, Jetsam I think his<br/>
  name is.  Lost the one of the girl with the Crown of Leaves too.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, Bildge Hunter.</div>
