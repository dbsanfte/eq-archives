<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475474193"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I guess you&#39;d better be careful when looting then.  Have to be<br/>
&gt; sure to check who can use the armor before looting it.  And if<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s nobody of that class in your group, might as well<br/>
&gt; destroy it.  :-(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally, if something has loot that I can&#39;t use for whatever reason, I<br/>
usually leave it on the body for some other lucky traveller to stumble upon.<br/>
No reason to waste it by destroying it.</div>
