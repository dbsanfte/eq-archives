<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891989574">Some mage was trying to trade this claiming it increased<br/>
string song effects by 25%.  As far as I know, no bard who<br/>
owns the lute has reported an increased effect.  So be wary of<br/>
misinformed non-bards trying to pawn this lute off to you for<br/>
much more than it&#39;s worth.  It has the special name because it<br/>
used to be a quest item, and will be a quest item again.<br/>
