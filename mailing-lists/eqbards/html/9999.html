&gt; The other night my druid was in North Karana and I was using tracking to<br/>

&gt; tracking at least four or five times before finally accepting the fact<br/>

spawns inside your tracking range, it gets tacked onto the top<br/>
of your tracking list.  The only exception is if you&#39;re<br/>
moving.  Then your tracking range &quot;circle&quot; moves with you, and<br/>
new stuff that enters this circle is tacked onto the top as if<br/>
it had just spawned.<br/>
<br/>
So if Grimfeather has been in your tracking range for the last<br/>
20 minutes (usually enough time for new stuff to bump him off<br/>
the list), he will not show up on it even if he&#39;s attacking<br/>
you.  (she?)<br/>

You can see this pretty remarkably in Kithicor.  Once dawn<br/>
approaches, all the &quot;normal&quot; mobs spawn quickly making ranger<br/>
tracking useless.  Bard tracking becomes useless soon<br/>
afterwards.  Meanwhile, druids can still find undead.<br/>
