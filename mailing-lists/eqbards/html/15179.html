<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023154540">I was in Paineel last night&lt;along with half the server&gt; and I ran into a<br/>
possible quest or item start it was in the Library one of the NPC&#39;s there<br/>
talks about &quot;storing mana&quot; Isn&#39;t that what viscous mana is?<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; *sigh* I play an enchanter too. Before they start giving bard<br/>
&gt; the ability<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to make enchanted items, why don&#39;t they implement what they<br/>
&gt; &gt;promised to do<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; for enchanters in doing the same first?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We even have Viscous Mana, etc now that seems to imply they would be<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; working on more. And... nothing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Maybe they&#39;re trying to figure out a way to not have the trade skill<br/>
&gt; &gt;completely monopolized by enchanters like jewelry currently is.<br/>
