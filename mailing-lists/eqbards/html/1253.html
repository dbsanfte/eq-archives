 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re that bad off at melee.  We use the same<br/>
weapon as a warrior/ranger/paladin.  With the Whistling<br/>
Warsong, you get a 15%-20% attack speedup based on research I<br/>
and someone else have done.  That btw is more than the<br/>
difference between a combine longsword and a well-balanced<br/>
longsword, and is like hitting for about 3 extra points damage<br/>
with a 17 point hit from a minotaur axe.  The same song also<br/>
buffs our str and AC.  Our bellow takes the place of a kick.  <br/>
And at L17 we get dual wield.  Our melee skills are weaker<br/>
than the melee classes, but IMHO the difference is only just<br/>
starting to become apparent at L17.  (The biggest difference I<br/>
see is with my warrior friend, but he has double attack as<br/>
well).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you try to fight like a tank, yes you&#39;re going to have a<br/>
hard time.  You&#39;re not a real tank.  You&#39;re a bard.  You can<br/>
kite (twist Accelerando and Bellow).  If you disapprove of<br/>
that, you can run and heal (twist Accelerando and<br/>
Restoration), then turn to finish the fight when you think you<br/>
have the upper hand again.  (Do what I did and map all your<br/>
keys to the left side of the keyboard, so you don&#39;t have to<br/>
reach all over to do things like auto-run while changing your<br/>
weapons and instruments.)<br/>
<br/>
I have had no problems soloing from L12-17 (and if you&#39;re<br/>
wondering, I&#39;ve only kited once, and that was a couple nights<br/>
ago when a red pirate in the Ocean of Tears spawned on top of<br/>
me.  The only way to zone out of the OOT is via the boat, so<br/>
it was either kite or die.  I used up half my stamina running<br/>
with Accelerando while mulling over what to do before deciding<br/>
to kite.)<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the bard&#39;s biggest asset is Accelerando.  Use it,<br/>
whether to kite, or heal, or flee.  I haven&#39;t died above<br/>
ground since L12, and that was to a train.  In that time, I&#39;ve<br/>
attacked ghouls (before I had a magic weapon), Dorn, and sand<br/>
giants; been attacked by werewolves, griffins (yeah, the big<br/>
nasty cousins of griffawns), DVinn, Kiz, and the Minotaur<br/>
Hero.  I haven&#39;t died to any of them.  The game is *very*<br/>
different for the folks who don&#39;t have SoW or Accelerando.<br/>
Every fight is a do or die (or zone) affair for them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You high lvl players,<br/>

&gt; damage and be able to hold our own?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You may be in a low point because you are just shy of getting<br/>
dual wield.  The other low point seems to come at around twice<br/>
that, when the &quot;kick&quot; from dual wield has faded.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; group.  Higher in lvl&#39;s groups are looking for wizards,<br/>
&gt; tanks, and healers where do we fit in?  Just a little<br/>
&gt; frustrated i guess from dying 3 times in Unrest<br/>
&gt; yesterday...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bards are great at augmenting the tanks and healers.  We buff<br/>
everyone in the party, and you save the healers from having to<br/>
constantly top off the tanks.  We&#39;re also great at train<br/>
control with the lullaby (which probably doesn&#39;t work that<br/>
great for you at L15).  I spent three hours with my group in<br/>
Befallen level 2 and 3 and we had a blast.  We dropped to<br/>
about 2-3 bubbles of health all around after a particularly<br/>
nasty fight (green wisp kept fleeing and bringing back more<br/>
monsters), but nobody was every in danger of dying.  I had to<br/>
get to sleep so I left, and the group took in a paladin as a<br/>
replacement (warrior, 2 paladins, 3 clerics).  While at the<br/>
bank, I got a /tell saying one of them died and they all had<br/>
to zone because they couldn&#39;t handle a train that would&#39;ve<br/>
been a piece of cake with me around.<br/>
<br/>
I just have not had problems finding a group, and lately have<br/>
been getting unsolicited /tells asking if I&#39;d like to join a<br/>
group.  My friends know I&#39;m not primarily there to fight; I&#39;m<br/>
there to make them fight better (or the monsters fight worse).<br/>
That&#39;s the nature of the class - we&#39;re a lot like enchanters<br/>
in that respect.  But if this indirect approach is<br/>
unfulfilling and you have an urge to &quot;kick ass&quot; :-) from time<br/>
to time, I suggest you start a second character (warrior or<br/>
monk or wizard - they level quickest) and switch between the<br/>
two.<br/>
