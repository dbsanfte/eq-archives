&gt; I was thinking of the KS&#39;ing crowd, though indirectly.  A druid or other<br/>
&gt; tracker could just sit by while people wandered about killing stuff and when<br/>
&gt; the single named mob showed up race to it and have a fair chance of getting<br/>
&gt; there first as the people who cleared the way for it have moved on to other<br/>
&gt; areas and are likely in a fight when the special spawns.  If there are<br/>
&gt; twelve different specials it would make it that much harder for the &quot;tracker<br/>
&gt; in the shadows&quot; to just rush over and nab the special when it popped up as<br/>
&gt; likely several specials would be popping up at any given time if the place<br/>
&gt; has a fair amount of explorers in it.  Since the container guy doesn&#39;t move,<br/>

(assuming no change in rare spawn frequency) for a kill<br/>
stealer to get the special item.  It also makes it 12x harder<br/>
for the group to get the special item.  They cancel out.  <br/>
Well, maybe the group gets to see who the kill stealer(s) is<br/>
before they lose the item.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, that was why I said maybe the named mob should just<br/>
drop on top of your while you are fighting.  It doesn&#39;t reward<br/>
the parasitic opportunists that way.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of mobs dropping on top of you...  My paladin friend<br/>
was soloing a bit in LGuk a couple nights ago.  He was<br/>
fighting in the halls (dead side).  He&#39;d fight one mob, other<br/>
people&#39;s pulls would ignore him.  I joined him.  Other<br/>
people&#39;s pulls saw the bard singing a song, and decided they<br/>
hated the bard more than the person pulling them.  Bleh.  I&#39;d<br/>
just assumed all this time that mobs other people were pulling<br/>
would attack you if they saw you fighting another mob (the<br/>
&quot;help a friend&quot; AI).  I didn&#39;t realize it only happened to<br/>
bards.<br/>
