<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229793329">Hello fellow Bards!<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the list and I would like to say that it is wonderful the<br/>
information that is shared among the bards of EQ. I am a lvl 11 Bard on the<br/>
Karana server and I need some information please.<br/>
<br/>
My bard is a half-elf and I currently have a full set of bronze armor and I&#39;m<br/>
equipped with a Turtle-shell Helm and I have a barbed leather whip and the<br/>
screaming mace for weapons. I currently have the standard instruments, the<br/>
drum for the spidersilk quest and a mandolin.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this....what kind of armor, weapons, and instruments would be<br/>
worthy of investment for me at this point?<br/>
<br/>
My finances are slightly better, though not great, than a normal lvl 11 as my<br/>
bard is my secondary character, albeit quickly becoming primary because I love<br/>
being a bard!<br/>
<br/>
Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated....Thanks!!!<br/>
<br/>
V/R,<br/>
