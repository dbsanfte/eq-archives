 </span></blockquote>I have my Hand-to-hand at 68 right now, and I have found an interesting <br/>
thing.  When I slow medium or easy blues, I can kill em faster and take less <br/>
damage by twisting Denon&#39;s Discord (with Horn) and Melodic Binding with a <br/>
bellow thrown in every once and a while.  Just have to stay in 3rd person <br/>
view to look out for wanderers. I just made 22nd this afternoon and used <br/>
this alot on Aviaks in S Karana to do it :)<br/>
