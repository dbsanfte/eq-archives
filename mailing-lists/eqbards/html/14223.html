Check EQV.  Hopefully that&#39;ll will refresh Verant&#39;s memory, and get<br/>
it speeded up.  If it isn&#39;t up soon, I&#39;ll contact Geoffrey myself.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps,<br/>

&gt; As you may have noticed Aurum in all the updates there have been almost no<br/>
&gt; fixes or bonuses to bards.  Of all classes bards do the least damage, are<br/>
&gt; the only ones with missing spells (one per level 3 missing) have<br/>
completely<br/>
&gt; useless song (mana drain song against creatures with unlimited mana and<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t work in PVP) etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bards were promised a &quot;Archmage answers&quot; section dedicated to them 3<br/>
almost<br/>
&gt; 4 weeks ago and still have not seen it.  Please Aurum, please let people<br/>
&gt; know there is another group of people who have tried very hard to be<br/>
silent<br/>
&gt; and not cause trouble that a being ignored and treated like third class<br/>
&gt; citizens.  Look for yourself of all the responces given to the other<br/>
&gt; classes.. by Verant and the total of 5 I can ever recall to the bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your time.<br/>
