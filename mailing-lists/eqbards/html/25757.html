&gt; Dilemma...I have some Singing Steel, and I have some Imbrued.  Problem is,<br/>
&gt;the pieces duplicate.  Example, I have SS helm and Imbrued helm, SS arms and<br/>
&gt;Imbrued arm...etc.  What is considered &quot;better&quot;?  SS is real nice AC, but<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s leaving my stats lacking.  Imbrued has some pretty good stats, but at<br/>
&gt;the cost of some AC.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some have mentioned they carry 2 sets of armor.  I&#39;d rather not do that,<br/>
&gt;since I quickly get encumbered now as it is.  Currently, my &quot;fresh from the<br/>
&gt;bank going out to do stuff&quot; weight is around 80/113.  Add some armor to<br/>
&gt;that, and I&#39;ll be starting out encumbered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I really need to look at my shoulder, back, and waist slots.  My<br/>
&gt;shoulders is still blood stained mantle, back is, I think decent, but don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know what my options are, and my waist is the Straw Spun Belt.  Decent AC at<br/>
&gt;10, but at 6 weight, I think it&#39;s too heavy.  I wouldn&#39;t mind options that I<br/>
&gt;could go and get myself solo, but I have a 51 shaman friend who can help.<br/>
&gt;Oh, I&#39;m 50, finally.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any and all suggestions are very welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>
