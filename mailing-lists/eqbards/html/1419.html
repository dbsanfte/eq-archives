that manner.  The way the worded their bannable offenses,<br/>
being a jerk to random people is ok, but being a jerk to a<br/>
specific person is not.  That means if you&#39;re an all-around<br/>
jerk, you can&#39;t be banned.  But if you try to do something to<br/>
thwart that jerk within the PvP- game mechanics, you can be<br/>
banned.<br/>
<br/>
I simply cannot believe that that is what they intended when<br/>
they came up with the policy - to keep the jerks in the game<br/>
while banning the people trying to stop the jerks.  So I<br/>
disagree with that interpretation, and would say dropping a<br/>
train on someone hogging a spawn is not a bannable offense.<br/>
You may have trouble convincing a GM that that was what you<br/>
were doing though.  Best to have many witnesses on your side.<br/>
