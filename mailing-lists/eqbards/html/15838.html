&gt; Last night I was doing Seafuries in OOT with a full party.  We had a<br/>
shaman who was using Togors to slow them in every battle.  After a couple of<br/>
hours, the shaman had to go and the slow responsibility became that of the<br/>
enchanter in the party.  At that time we had changed over to include 2<br/>
mages, an enchanter, a druid and me, the mages and the enchanter each with<br/>
pets.  Since my songs don&#39;t work on pets, I scrapped curtails (malise was<br/>
more then enough), celerity (effects only me), chant (effects only me), for<br/>
mana song only...  For the heck of it, I decided to mem up binding which I<br/>
really haven&#39;t used since maybe 21rst level.  Next thing I know everyone is<br/>
asking who is slowing the cyclops.  Everyone was pleasantly surprised to<br/>
find out it was me.  I know the shaman slow downs vs. the bard are well<br/>
documented.  Has anyone ever compared the enchanter line of spells in this<br/>
regard to the bard?<br/>
