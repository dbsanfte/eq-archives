<div id="ygrps-yiv-723973984">You say you are using two piercing weapons at level 36.  I am assuming that<br/>
one of them is the dirk.  What is the other?  I had let my pierce skill<br/>
slack quite a bit, so I got out my dirk and a FS dagger.  That was the first<br/>
time I had used two piercers at one time.  With the quickness spell from an<br/>
enchanter friend of mine, I was a quisinart.  Also I liked the rogue look<br/>
that it gave me.  Especially with the Mask of Deception on.<br/>

        Like someone else just said, you really can&#39;t use a 2h slash.<br/>
  Personally, at 17, I was using 2 piercing weapons.  Eventually I moved to<br/>
2<br/>
  slashing weapons.  And now at 36, I&#39;m back to 2 piercing weapons :)<br/>
<br/>
        Basically, once you hit 17, you&#39;ll be dual wielding the rest of your<br/>
  life.  I don&#39;t know any bard that uses a shield (though it is possible)<br/>
<br/>
        Don&#39;t forget your 1h blunt also.  Mine is only about 120 now,<br/>
  instead of 185 where all my others are.  It&#39;s just that to me, no 1h blunt<br/>
  weapons are really that good, so I haven&#39;t really botherd with it much.<br/>
