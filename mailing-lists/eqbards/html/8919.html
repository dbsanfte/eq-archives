&gt; I was there last week with most of my guild, trying to get Meldrath&#39;s skull<br/>
&gt; for a few of our rangers.  The mino guards con&#39;d green to me at 47, and<br/>
&gt; yellow to one of our Paladin&#39;s in his 20&#39;s.  Meldrath con&#39;d blue however,<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;d say high blue from how hard he&#39;d hit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, when we took them on the week before the patch, Meldrath<br/>
was green, the guards were blue-yellow (at 37) and hit like<br/>
giants.  After the patch the guards were green and Meldrath<br/>
was blue.  Also, the minotaur hero doesn&#39;t spawn when you kill<br/>
Meldrath anymore.  Bad news for the hero bracer hunters.<br/>
