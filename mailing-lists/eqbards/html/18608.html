&gt;     I can understand the concern for having people you trust to know how to<br/>
&gt; play their chars and not &quot;ninja-loot&quot;.  But unless I&#39;m missing something -<br/>
&gt; this concept is what causes people in smaller guilds to complain of<br/>
&gt; &quot;uber-guilds&quot; and &quot;Character Stealing&quot;.  Is it TRULY necessary to have a<br/>
&gt; single guild complete these events?<br/>

I look on the high end eq game like a team sport for gaming geeks, and<br/>
like most team sports, it requires the kind of people who can put aside<br/>
problems they may have with other people on the team in favor of the<br/>
larger goal. In general, I think the kinds of people who are attracted<br/>
to small guilds because &quot;we only invite people everyone likes&quot; are less<br/>
inclined to be able to play this way, while those that end up joining<br/>
larger guilds aren&#39;t. Planes and dragon raids (and dungeon raids in<br/>
Kunark to a large extent) require a lot of trust in the other people, as<br/>
you will often have to consent someone else to move your corpse. They<br/>
also require a willingness to follow directions from whoever is the<br/>
leader, sometimes in spite of any opinion you might have that it&#39;s<br/>
totally the wrong thing to be doing.  With a collection of smaller<br/>
guilds, this is a lot more difficult to manage.  The only way I could<br/>
see this happening is for a group of small guilds to work up to it and<br/>
try to build the trust and teamwork, maybe starting with Kedge raids or<br/>
some of the easier dungeons in Kunark, which are empty enough that they<br/>
give you lots of practice working as a team to clear unfamiliar ground.<br/>
