&gt;mob, hit auto attack, then give /pet attack command (do not get a message<br/>
&gt;from pet).  When I follow these steps, the mob just sits there and does<br/>
&gt;nothing.  It helps by keeping the mob from attacking us, but I would<br/>
&gt;obviously prefer if he attacked what I told him to.  Need someone who has<br/>
&gt;experience charming with the 39 charm song to tell me what you do to get<br/>
&gt;your pet to attack.  BTW I do not have this problem with the 27 charm song.<br/>
