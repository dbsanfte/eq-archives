&gt;One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a vein in my<br/>
&gt;forehead.<br/>
&gt;It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed Bolster Belt.<br/>
&gt;This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste effect. The<br/>
&gt;question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>
&gt;abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>
&gt;had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>
&gt;(Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>
&gt;would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>
&gt;a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>
