<div id="ygrps-yiv-585420335">I&#39;m not failing to see, I just have a different opinion on what an MMORPG is<br/>
than you do :)  Now if you want to call it an MMOVW (virtual world) yes then<br/>
I would expect trade skills to be a large part of it.  As a roleplaying game<br/>
for me, EQ has everything that I could ask for.  Yes there needs to be some<br/>
work, but admit it, the trade skills are not put in for the *fun* value.<br/>
They are put in there to make money so you can buy better equipment so you<br/>
can go fight more stuff (or in UO, kill other people).  If you could buy<br/>
better weapons in Quake style games and there was a way to make money,<br/>
people would flock to it just so they could get the BMG they needed to frag<br/>
everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
As for your last paragraph, I have to admit I don&#39;t get confused by alot of<br/>
things but that confused the hell out of me.  I have read it 3 or 4 times<br/>
and I don&#39;t quite grasp what you are trying to say.  I do have one thing to<br/>
say about your last line though:  people that pay real money for online<br/>
stuff have 2 things and missing one thing.  1) Alot of money, 2) Alot of<br/>
time, and the thing they are missing is sense.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Trade skills is what some people want in an MMORPG.  That is why I like<br/>
&gt; EQ,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to deal with trade skills to make money - I work enough in<br/>
&gt; RL,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t want to play a game and work there too.  In all of my years of<br/>
&gt; &gt; roleplaying (AD&D, Amber, etc) I don&#39;t ever remembering anyone saying &#39;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to go out and explore and kill stuff, I would rather make<br/>
&gt; armor<br/>
&gt; &gt; or jewelry!&#39;  That is what NPC&#39;s did for you.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What you&#39;re failing to see is that a MMORPG is *more* than a<br/>
&gt; pencil & paper RPG.  A P&P RPG was limited to just a few<br/>
&gt; people in a universe where everyone but them was an NPC.  A<br/>
&gt; MMORPG is a virtual universe, and for the first time the<br/>
&gt; possibility exists where the entire world *could* be run<br/>
&gt; without any NPCs at all.  If killing monsters with friends is<br/>
&gt; all you want, then you don&#39;t need something as extensive as UO<br/>
&gt; or EQ, a non-persistent world like Diablo is sufficient.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, the first MMORPG are going to emulate P&P RPGs, because<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s where all the previous experience with this type of<br/>
&gt; thing has been.  But as players and developers start to get a<br/>
&gt; better handle on just what is/isn&#39;t possible, we&#39;re going to<br/>
&gt; start getting closer and closer to the virtual realities that<br/>
&gt; keep getting hyped in the media.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was just talking with some UO friends about the new UO<br/>
&gt; server that&#39;s going up and the de-emphasized role of NPC<br/>
&gt; merchants there.  One of them said the same thing you did - he<br/>
&gt; works enough in real life, he doesn&#39;t want to spend his<br/>
&gt; game-playing time &quot;working&quot; in a &quot;game&quot; to help someone<br/>
&gt; maintain an online merchant store.  Then it hit us - someone<br/>
&gt; who is sufficiently wealthy in real life could *pay* someone<br/>
&gt; real-life money to employ someone to *work* in a merchant<br/>
&gt; store in a &quot;game.&quot;  That is the paradigm shift most people<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t yet realize - we are moving from &quot;online game&quot; to<br/>
&gt; &quot;virtual world,&quot; and the line between virtual and real is<br/>
&gt; beginning to blur.  We&#39;re already seeing it with people paying<br/>
&gt; real-life money for virtual items.<br/>
