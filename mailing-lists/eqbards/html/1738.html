<div id="ygrps-yiv-82901484">It&#39;s a 5 damage, 19 delay 1h slash that can only be equipped in your primary<br/>
hand..you can&#39;t dual wield them. They are lore items, or soon to be now,<br/>
too.  I use one as my primary quite often, for the looks as well as the<br/>
speed.<br/>
<br/>
They come from the Avatar of Fear in the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule.<br/>
<br/>
The Avatar is a shrunk down manifestation of Cazic Thule himself, and he&#39;s<br/>
pretty tough, a full party of mid- thirties players  has their work cut out<br/>
for them killing him and his minions.  Not to mention he&#39;s a rare pop.  He<br/>
drops either the demon claw, or the more sought after Rubicite breastplate.<br/>
<br/>
With them becoming lore items, you might see more hitting the market as<br/>
players who hoarded them may try to dump them before they poof.  After that,<br/>
expect to see less, as the farmers (not that there were ever a lot of Avatar<br/>
farmers!) stop farming.<br/>
<br/>
If I were you, I&#39;d see about getting barbed leather whips.  Those are very<br/>
good 1h slash weapons (7 damage 28 delay), and are not hard to come by..and<br/>
they are not tagged Lore either.  Selling price varies from server to<br/>
server, but I&#39;ve never seen it go higher than 50 plat, and that was on a<br/>
&#39;young&#39; server where there was only a handful of players able to get them at<br/>
the time.  You can get them yourself with minimal difficulty in a party of<br/>
20th level players, and have fun doing it.  They&#39;re in Najena.<br/>
<br/>
Your other option, and possibly easier in terms of just needing cash, is to<br/>
buy well balanced scimitars.  5 damage, 21 delay, they are excellent bard<br/>
weapons, and will hold you into the 30&#39;s (so will the barbed leather whips)<br/>
as they maximize your dual wield skill and take full advantage of your<br/>
combat songs.  But at around 250 plat a pop, they&#39;re not cheap.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also obsidian weapons to be had in SoldungA, you might see if any of<br/>
those are on the market on your server.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t limit yourself to 1h slash only, if you can help it.  There&#39;s some<br/>
very nice pierce,(Jambiya, Obsidian Dagger, Ashenwood Short Spear, later on<br/>
the Fanged Skull Stiletto, etc)  and even 1h blunt now (Staff of Writhing,<br/>
Gem Encrusted Scepter, the old favorite Screaming Mace, etc.), that a bard<br/>
can use.  You should make an effort to gain skill in one or both of those<br/>
weapons types, it&#39;ll serve you well later in life.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve let your pierce or blunt training slip, scrounge up a couple of<br/>
fine steel daggers, at 19 delay, they will give you a lot of skill rolls in<br/>
pierce(AND dual wield), you should be able to quickly (in a couple levels of<br/>
off and on use) get those skills maxed out.   This is best done in a group,<br/>
and best done when you can afford to slack a bit, in light combat.<br/>
<br/>
A fine steel warhammer is slower, 30 delay, but fast for a 1h blunt.  Expect<br/>
to take a more levels to max skill in 1h blunt out, due to the 50 percent<br/>
greater delay factor of the weapon.  But like I said, it&#39;s a good investment<br/>
for your character to be proficient in all his weapons skills, it adds<br/>
variety, options, and spice.<br/>
<br/>
Both are easy to get, btw, and should run you about 5 plat each, as most<br/>
players sell FS daggers and warhammers at merchant resale prices..there&#39;s<br/>
very little market for either.<br/>

&gt;high level warrior and he said that it was 1h slash - 5 dam 20 del . is<br/>
this<br/>
&gt;true? if so how much does it cost? He said you got it in ogguk or something<br/>
,<br/>
&gt;what lvl is that zone , and what creatures does it come off of . ( if its a<br/>
&gt;demon don&#39;t think i&#39;m stupid , i&#39;ve never been there)<br/>
&gt; Another question i have is , So polished granite tomahawk doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;seem to be worth it as i read these posts , so what do i get . i have 2<br/>
&gt;combine long swords w/ like 50pp in the bank , what should i get ? I&#39;m the<br/>
&gt;type of person that would save up for the best possible weapon just because<br/>
