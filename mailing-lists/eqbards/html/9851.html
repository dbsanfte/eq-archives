<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959641258">i remember this patch in beta.  what i believe happened is not the type of<br/>
armor affecting how hard you are hit, but how much the AC stat of each type<br/>
of armor contributed to your total overall AC.  i remember lots of casters<br/>
yelling how they lost as much as 100 AC points from their total, as i was a<br/>
wizard and remember well.  i.e. plate armor will add more over and above its<br/>
actual AC stat than will cloth armor.  therefore your total AC goes up<br/>
differently based on your level, agility, defense skill, and armor type.  i<br/>
do not know if plate armor has more absorbing value, just that it adds more<br/>
AC over and above its stats.<br/>
<br/>
just a theory, i could be totally off-base.<br/>

&gt; I want to believe that you are 100% correct.  However, gonna <br/>
&gt; put on the<br/>
&gt; devil&#39;s advocate hat here for the sake of discussion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First:  There is a big difference between the AC of a caster <br/>
&gt; and the AC of<br/>
&gt; someone wearing platemail, especially if they are the same <br/>
&gt; level.  The only<br/>
&gt; way a caster will have a higher AC over a plate wearing class <br/>
&gt; is if they are<br/>
&gt; higher in level and get the benefit of a higher Defense skill <br/>
&gt; rating.  In<br/>
&gt; the observations where you have seen casters getting hit for <br/>
&gt; more damage<br/>
&gt; than plate wearers, were the casters a lot higher in level or <br/>
&gt; similar in<br/>
&gt; level to the plate wearing classes?  If they were a lot <br/>
&gt; higher in level and<br/>
&gt; therefore, in theory, had AC values that were close to one <br/>
&gt; another, then the<br/>
&gt; fact that the caster was getting hit for more damage than the <br/>
&gt; platemail<br/>
&gt; wearer could be attributed to the platemail deflecting part <br/>
&gt; of the blow.  If<br/>
&gt; the caster and platemail wearer were similar in levels, I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think you<br/>
&gt; can compare the two.  The platemail wearer would almost <br/>
&gt; certainly have had a<br/>
&gt; higher AC than the caster and therefore shouldn&#39;t have been <br/>
&gt; hit for as much<br/>
&gt; damage.  <br/>
