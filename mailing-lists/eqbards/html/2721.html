<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411101732">you don&#39;t have to camp.  just like in the past when a procing weapon made<br/>
our songs stick, you can click on and off a song as fast as you can like 15<br/>
or so times to unstick it, it works eventually.<br/>
<br/>
luckily i look so much better as a wood elf than dark elf i don&#39;t use my<br/>
mask too much unless to show i&#39;m in an evil bad mood =P<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The<br/>
&gt; whole spell stacking/canceling issue seems to still be <br/>
&gt; fubard, for instance<br/>
&gt; i cant use the mask of the deciever to turn into a dark elf <br/>
&gt; while a song is<br/>
&gt; playing. And if a song happens to be playing while the mask <br/>
&gt; effect wears<br/>
&gt; off my songs lock up and i cant change or stop or start a <br/>
&gt; song unless i<br/>
&gt; camp out. <br/>
