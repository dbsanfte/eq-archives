<div id="ygrps-yiv-352483608">Clarity at 20?  I will go from, &quot;having a very hard time finding a group&quot;<br/>
(pre xp patch), to &quot;sometimes, I can&#39;t find a group&quot; (post xp patch), to &quot;I<br/>
wish people would stop sending me tells, I&#39;m already in a group&quot; (if this<br/>
patch goes through).  I don&#39;t mean that as a complaint...hehe.<br/>
<br/>
The defensive skill improvement, I think is a good thing, and not just for<br/>
the &quot;I want more stuff&quot; reason.  I guess the best example I can give is what<br/>
happened to me last night.<br/>
<br/>
I was in a group in the LOIO Sarnak fort, and our puller brings in a<br/>
revenant and his pet.  No sweat.  In groupchat, I see &quot;add&quot;.  No sweat,<br/>
still.  We fight for a bit.  In groupchat, I see &quot;add&quot;, almost immediately<br/>
followed by the first kill.  Ok, a little concern, but heck, we have a<br/>
chanter.  Watching everyones health drop about evenly.  Not too worried.<br/>
Next thing I know, the dreaded &quot;OOM&quot;&#39;s come floating across groupchat.  At<br/>
this point, everyone&#39;s health is dropping, fast.  Mine not too bad, cause<br/>
I&#39;ve just been doing some anthem, chains, health twisting.  Chanter goes<br/>
&quot;OOM&quot;.  I&#39;m wondering what is going on, since we were tank light, I was in<br/>
there with the warrior, meleeing.  Keep in mind, I&#39;m thinking we&#39;re now<br/>
taking on two, so imagine my surprise when health bars practically<br/>
disappear.  Ok, I&#39;m going to die.  I&#39;ve been a bard long enough that I see<br/>
it coming.  I get the urge to flee a good 10 seconds before everyone else,<br/>
but being the good groupmate I am, I refuse to abandon them.  Again, keep in<br/>
mind, I think we have, at most 3 MOB&#39;s beating on us.  Someone says &quot;run&quot;,<br/>
and I fire up Kelin&#39;s Lullaby.  I figure, 3 MOB&#39;s...even only one falls<br/>
asleep, another of us may get away.  Imagine my utter bafflement as I get 3<br/>
asleep messages, and 5 (yes, that&#39;s FIVE) resist messages.<br/>
<br/>
I think they all hit me at once...  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point is, is that when a bard is taking anything more than the<br/>
occassional hit, the bard has ticked something off royally.  To date, when<br/>
this happens, you either have supreme confidence in your group, or you fire<br/>
up selos and get the heck away.  Unfortunately, option 2 is usually your<br/>
best bet.<br/>
<br/>
I ramble...heh.<br/>
<br/>
I had a great weekend playing these last two days.  I dinged twice...and<br/>
undinged twice, as well.  From 26 to 27, to 26 to 27, to 26.  After about 30<br/>
hours of play this weekend, I&#39;m about a quarter of a bubble down from where<br/>
I started.  :)<br/>
