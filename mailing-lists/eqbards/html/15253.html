 </span></blockquote>Yes it has a haste effect, str boost, and AC boost.  If I were<br/>
using the raw figures from the parsing program, yes it&#39;d make<br/>
a difference.  But I&#39;m not.  I took the total weapon damage,<br/>
total weapon hits and misses, and calculated an average damage<br/>
per hit and per swing.  Then I divided it by the weapon delay<br/>
to artificially produce the average damage over time.  That<br/>
has the effect of eliminating any haste, stun, out of range,<br/>
can&#39;t see target, etc. factors which might screw up a straight<br/>
parse.<br/>
<br/>
The Z-axis limitation for combat messages (and I&#39;d assume<br/>
says) is smaller than your melee range.  There were several<br/>
times when the Allizewsaur was climbing up a hill, and my<br/>
weapons were swinging and procing, but I wasn&#39;t getting any<br/>
combat text.  The way I handled the data above also eliminates<br/>
any problems due to this.<br/>
