<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023201460">So basically Chains is like bards in general?  An afterthought that&#39;s nice<br/>
to have when the real spells fail.  I waited 22 levels for this.  Sigh,<br/>
maybe I should just give in and play a necro so I can complain about how my<br/>
400 pt DoT&#39;s take a whole minute to happen and my 65 point heal/DD&#39;s aren&#39;t<br/>
mana efficient because my pet keeps me from ever taking damage.  Sighs in<br/>
defeat.<br/>

Chains is a backup song to snare or to be used on runners when there is no<br/>
&quot;snarer&quot; present.  It is as simple as that.  If for some reason snare<br/>
doesn&#39;t stick... or is more often the case at higher levels it is resisted<br/>
many times in a row, then chains is the backup and emergency tool for<br/>
stopping runners.<br/>
<br/>
For example, this weekend we did the Efreeti raid...  We almost screwed it<br/>
all up because one damn imp resisted all of the snare attempts and started<br/>
running.  What saved the day?  Luckily the other bard in the group had<br/>
chains loaded and stopped the runner cold in its tracks.  Me being a DOLT<br/>
didn&#39;t have it up (last time I do that!).<br/>
<br/>
As for reliability, chains is resisted far too often, breaks far too easily<br/>
and lasts not nearly long enough to be used as the primary means of stopping<br/>
runners.  As a backup to a good druid or ranger, it is simply awesome<br/>
(particularly because you can sing it while chasing after the runner).<br/>
There is nothing I hate more then having to do runner control for a party.<br/>
There are far more important things for a bard to do.<br/>
<br/>
What about the slow down effect?  Well your level 20 song is as good as<br/>
chains, has an area effect, doesn&#39;t break root and stacks with the<br/>
enchanters slow downs.  IMHO this is a much better song for during combat<br/>
and chains should be loaded for the emergency situations when everything<br/>
else fails.<br/>
<br/>
As for Lazy vs. non-lazy snarers?  Snare tends to last 2 minutes normally.<br/>
We have all our snarers announce when they have got snare to stick.  Every<br/>
snarer keeps casting until one of the announces.  99% of the time when<br/>
someone gets snare to stick, it is unnecassary for any further action to<br/>
prevent a runner and chains is a sufficient backup to the 1% of the time<br/>
when the MOB breaks snare for some unknown god-awful reason.  The biggest<br/>
problem with snare is its resist rate, but once it sticks, it usually sticks<br/>
for the duration.  If your snarers aren&#39;t repeating snare attempts until<br/>
they get one to stick, then your snarers are not doing their job.<br/>
