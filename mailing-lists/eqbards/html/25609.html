<br/>
W32.Goner.A@mm is a mass-mailing worm that is written in Visual Basic. The <br/>
worm has been compressed using a known Portable Executable (PE)* file <br/>
compressor. The worm can spread its infection using the ICQ network as well <br/>
as by email using Microsoft Outlook. If IRC is installed, this worm can <br/>
also insert mIRC scripts that will enable the computer to be used in Denial <br/>
of Service (DOS) attacks.<br/>
<br/>
W32.Goner.A@mm starts by displaying an &quot;About&quot; window with credits of the <br/>
author and shoutouts to his friends.<br/>
<br/>
In the background, the worm starts iterating the Microsoft Outlook address <br/>
book and sends itself to all addresses in the address book. The email <br/>
appears as follows.<br/>
<br/>
Subject: Hi<br/>
Body:<br/>
How are you ?<br/>
When I saw this screen saver, I immediately thought about you<br/>
I am in a harry, I promise you will love it!<br/>
Attachment: GONE.SCR<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
W32.Goner.A@mm is capable of spreading over the ICQ network. If ICQ is <br/>
installed on an infected machine, the worm will do the following:<br/>
1. Check for the version of the ICQ .dll file that contains the APIs that <br/>
will be used. If the correct version is found, the worm proceeds.<br/>
2. Disable all notification. This means that the user cannot see what the <br/>
worm is doing in the background.<br/>
3. Retrieve a list of all &quot;buddies&quot; who are currently online.<br/>
4. Retrieve information about each user individually. This information is <br/>
required to be able to send files.<br/>
5. Send itself to all users on the list.<br/>
6. Re-enable all notifications.<br/>
<br/>
If mIRC is installed, this worm can insert scripts into the mIRC folder. <br/>
This allows the computer to be used in DOS attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the worm displays the following fake error message:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Error while Analyze DirectX!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you get this email DO NOT OPEN THE ATTACHMENT.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading,<br/>
