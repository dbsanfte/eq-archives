<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195942046">Hmmm, ok, add that to my last post.  The level 45 Shaman did have a pet<br/>
doggie that was helping us out.  Perhaps that was why the ranger was able to<br/>
KS the bouncers.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was with a level 36 Barbarian Shaman (with her pet) who was soloing,<br/>

&gt; &gt; [Stuff about getting kill from shaman w/ pet w/ Fufil&#39;s]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a bug.  It has to do with a misappropriation of damage or something<br/>
&gt; when a pet is involved with a group.  I&#39;ve seen it happen many times, for<br/>
&gt; example a group is holding the stone spider room in solusek B when a<br/>
&gt; ranger shows up to await a fire giant run.  The group has a necro in it<br/>
&gt; with a pet, and on multiple occasions the single ranger gets the<br/>
&gt; experience instead of the group of six.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t claim to know how credit toward the kill works, but I&#39;ve seen this<br/>
&gt; occur enough times to surmise the cause.<br/>
