<b>Subject:</b> do the rythms resistances even work? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-932962125">i was in permafrost last night, juggling guardian and elemental with a<br/>
drum, along with a magic resist booster from an enchanter. having all<br/>
three going at the same time (and a ruined bone fork) boosted my magic<br/>
resistance to 111 (!), yet i was still unable to resist a single spell<br/>
from an evoker who conned white to me (out of about 12 spells). as noted<br/>
in the new 2.0 song guide, the spell shield seems to be non-existant. as a<br/>
result of my experience i can&#39;t even think why i should bother with magic<br/>
resistance at all, since i got ripped to shreds by force strike twice.<br/>
