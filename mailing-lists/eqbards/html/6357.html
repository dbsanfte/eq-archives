<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556603681">Hi ho everyone!<br/>
<br/>
DING!  Master Bard lady in freeport has granted me my 15th song.  Now to just find it.. hehe<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading the success of many on here.  It&#39;s great to read all the info about songs, hunting grounds, and so forth and so on.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;ve been trying to juggle my songs when I&#39;m grouped with my darling husband Shaeloren (warrior).  I hardly even use bellow until there at the end if it&#39;s needed.. i.e. when Shae&#39;s health is low and i&#39;m tanking while he heals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I seem to use str,heal,and bellows the most.<br/>
<br/>
But mostly the str&heal part.  I feel like i&#39;m cheating myself here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got everything set up on hot keys..so it&#39;s easy to swithch.. weapon,songs,instruments..  <br/>
<br/>
I am no strategist(sp?) by any means... I mean, I discovered by boo boo that i could juggle songs.. eh<br/>
Shae tries to help me work out which songs do us good for battles..but he&#39;s no bard.. and having him sit right beside me and he pops up..Use such in such.. well.. i&#39;ve bitten him a few times with some piercing looks.. hehe<br/>
<br/>
he&#39;s decided to let me play my bard the way I want to.  I love Tel.. I&#39;ve been every race,class there can be.  I love my WElf Bard lady! =)  But, Like I said Strategy is not my field.  <br/>
<br/>
Shae can lay down plots and what and how we can do and will do things easily.  (thanks to uncle sam)..=)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did I make any sense?  Oh I hope so! hehe<br/>
