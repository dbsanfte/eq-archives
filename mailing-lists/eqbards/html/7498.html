<b>Subject:</b> The Binding Issue <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-123827924">I think one of the reasons a lot of us are sick of arguing this <br/>
point - it&#39;s a &quot;hot-button&quot; topic similar IRL to abortion...  For those <br/>
people who have made up their mind and have strong feelings on this <br/>
issue there is little anyone is going to say that will change their <br/>
beliefs one iota.<br/>
<br/>
    I personally don&#39;t have strong personal opinions one way or another; <br/>
except that I&#39;m convinced that Verant&#39;s position is very hard and they <br/>
won&#39;t budge on this.  JM Caprozzi (sp?), wrote about this.  It&#39;s not <br/>
clear exactly how good of a source he was on this; but I expect pretty <br/>
good; talked about the internal debate at Verant .  According to this <br/>
info; this was one of the most contentious issues on the design team.  <br/>
Many were against expanding the binding to the point where it&#39;s at now.<br/>
<br/>
    One of the issues I recall he listed for bards (and some of the <br/>
other classes that don&#39;t have bind) not getting it - was the idea that <br/>
since we don&#39;t have to regenerate mana for our primary fighting ability <br/>
- we don&#39;t have the potential down-time between combat and <br/>
hypothetically can fight continuously.  The caster types with bind could <br/>
never do this; hence the need for a balancing factor.  [DON&#39;T ARGUE THIS <br/>
POINT WITH ME - THIS IS NOT MY BELIEF]<br/>
<br/>
    So bottom-line; what value are petitions here?  I think they are <br/>
useful on issues where Verant doesn&#39;t have a strong opinion, or is <br/>
wavering; but I doubt that Verant will change their philosophy of how <br/>
they think the game should work based on a petition.  The only thing <br/>
that I could see that would cause them to change their core design <br/>
philosophy if the number of subscribers and hence cash-flow dropped a <br/>
significant amount - with letters, etc saying that the binding issue was <br/>
what led the player to quit.<br/>
<br/>
    This IMHO is why Ultima Online is adding non-PVP zones.  I <br/>
personally know of at least a half-zone (or more) people including <br/>
myself who left UOL because of PVP issues.   Money speaks.  But I doubt <br/>
that this is a deciding issue for whether people will continue to pay <br/>
$10/hour for EQ.<br/>
<br/>
        What would be really nice for Verant; despite their desire to <br/>
keep the game mechanics hidden -  would be to have a chat session; or <br/>
simply posted a document discussing their high-level philosophy of the <br/>
game.  The Designer Dragon guy at Origin was great about this when the <br/>
PVP debate raged on.  I believe EQ proved him wrong (i.e. he said NO ONE <br/>
would play on PVP servers if non-PVP was available).<br/>
<br/>
    As far as future discussions of Bardic Binding; Personally I would <br/>
love it if all classes could be bound anywhere.  I don&#39;t think bards <br/>
should have the ability to bind themselves.  But more importantly; I <br/>
don&#39;t think Verant will ever change their position on it.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
enough people will quit the game over it to FORCE them to change.  I <br/>
think any further discussion is a waste of breath (not that people&#39;s <br/>
opinions are worthwhile or valid, it&#39;s simply a waste of time because we <br/>
aren&#39;t going to convince Verant).  I&#39;m certainly not going to quit the <br/>
game over it; and no one will be able to convince me to do so (at least <br/>
not over this issue...)<br/>
<br/>
    To be true to my word - this is the last time I will post on this <br/>
issue.<br/>
