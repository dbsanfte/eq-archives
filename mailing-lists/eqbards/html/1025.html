&gt; &gt; If your party is taking on monoliths, then you have no problem, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a mob-hunt, you are dead meat.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve started adding Jonathan&#39;s Whistling Warsong to the songs<br/>
&gt; I twist in a group simply for the added AC to cut down on the<br/>
&gt; amount of damage I take.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting idea, and I&#39;d probably do just that if I was able to<br/>
reliably twist 3 songs.  However, with a ping never being below<br/>
600, that seems more reliant on luck than skill.<br/>
