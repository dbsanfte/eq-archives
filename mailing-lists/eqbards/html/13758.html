<div id="ygrps-yiv-451766442">You (and me) see all the sense headings because I use a &quot;game controller&quot;  -<br/>
a programmable device for sending key codes to games - and play with left<br/>
hand on the controller and right hand on mouse.  I have &quot;sense heading&quot;<br/>
stacked with &quot;move forward&quot; and &quot;move back.&quot; Every time I start to move I<br/>
get a sense heading. At first (level 3), I wanted to get the skill maxed as<br/>
soon as possible.  Now it&#39;s just &#39;natural&#39; for me to keep tabs on which way<br/>
I am going.  Heh, and I still get lost real easily.<br/>
<br/>
When I did not die immediately, I started to &quot;look around&quot; inside the lair.<br/>
Prolly, a good idea for guilds who are thinking about doing a dragon - find<br/>
out when one is killed and go in while most of the bad stuff is still down<br/>
(6 and 8 hour spawns on giants) and get acquainted with the territory. Then<br/>
come back for Ice/Fire Giant &#39;practice&#39; when the dragons are still dead.<br/>
Then when you know that you can clear to the lair, try again and learn how<br/>
to not agro the dragon on your last pulls.  My guild has done all this but I<br/>
am a recent addition so this was my first time this deep in the lair.  Vox<br/>
lair has the additional perks of the pit traps so getting there can be fun<br/>
even when the dragon is dead.<br/>

&gt; Ouch!  But I&#39;ve been there my friend.  Not with Vox but with Fire Giants.<br/>
&gt; Nothing is worse than being summoned to a Fire Giant that is standing in<br/>
15<br/>
&gt; feet of lava.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; May I ask why you were sense heading all the time?<br/>
