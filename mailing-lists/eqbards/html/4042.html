<div id="ygrps-yiv-320852668">Well, I&#39;ve been following the Lute of the Gypsy princess thread (without <br/>
reading the spoilers when possible) and noticed I missed one critical thing. <br/>
  Where does the quest begin?  I&#39;d love to just know where to start and try <br/>
to figure things out from there on my own.  If you could tell me who to <br/>
speak with to start the quest, I&#39;d really appreciate it.  Maybe just tell me <br/>
the zone to look in or something.. Last question, what level do you need to <br/>
be to fill this quest?  I&#39;m a level 11 bard right now but I get a feeling <br/>
this quest was made for level 20+ or something.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info you can give,<br/>
<br/>
