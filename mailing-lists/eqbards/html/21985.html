<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126471022">I don&#39;t recall ever getting the original message to this thread, but for<br/>
those of you having assist problems, here is the whole secret (learned this<br/>
from my friendly neighborhood rogue).  There are 4 conditions that must be<br/>
met in order for /assist to work.<br/>
<br/>
1)  The person that you wish to assist must be your target...(pretty safe<br/>
bet that everyone has this part aced =P)<br/>
<br/>
2)  You must be in melee range of the assistees target<br/>
<br/>
3)  The assistee must hit the target, and the one that gets everyone.......<br/>
<br/>
4)  The mob must hit the assistee!!  Then assist is 100% reliable.  If the<br/>
mob doesn&#39;t hit your targeted assistee, chances are you&#39;ll be assisting<br/>
nothing (i.e. attacking your puller)<br/>
<br/>
Here is how I used to do it, pre-macro. I target the puller before he<br/>
leaves, and type /assist without hitting enter, wait until I read that the<br/>
puller has hit and been hit by said mob, and then hit enter (or you can just<br/>
hit enter before he leaves and scroll through your typing and hit it again<br/>
when he returns).<br/>
<br/>
As of the macro patch, I have a macro set up that starts like so:<br/>
<br/>
/assist<br/>
/pause 30, /cast X<br/>
/pause 1, /stopsong<br/>
/say Have at thee!!!<br/>
<br/>
Then I proceed with my twisting!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

I have found, regardless of what group make up I&#39;m in or what the puller is<br/>
using to pull, /assist can&#39;t be trusted.  I&#39;ve begun twisting songs only to<br/>
notice halfway through a battle against a single mob that I&#39;ve got no<br/>
target at all.<br/>
<br/>
I still have it hotkeyed, but as soon as possible in a fight I mouse click<br/>
whatever appears to be the main target just to be sure.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Really?! Dang! I&#39;m going to have a talk with my buddy then. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;They are aoe centered around the caster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can believe I&#39;m going to start pouring over enchanter spells at EQ<br/>
&gt;Casters right now. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looks like they do get a single target spell Whirl Til You Hurl that could<br/>
be used to stun a single mob, but yes, overall enchanter stuns are aoe.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that this WTYH spell can be used vs the giants. Was very<br/>
interesting that my cleric&#39;s stun/holy might would stun giants, yet the<br/>
enchanter stuns would never stick. We may have to experiment with WTYH at<br/>
sometime as well.<br/>
<br/>
As for AOE stun based around the caster, now I understand why you were<br/>
saying they could mez more utilizing stun than they could with just AOE<br/>
mez.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed something that could very well be a bug. My wife (druid)<br/>
would pull froggies to us. I&#39;m sitting next to her so I see what she is<br/>
targetted on. I push my &quot;/assist &lt;char_name&gt;&quot; button and interestingly,<br/>
find that I&#39;m targetted upon a different frog. (Of course &lt;char_name&gt; is<br/>
filled in with her character&#39;s name)<br/>
It has wreaked a little havoc having our necro Dot&#39;ing the wrong frog. It<br/>
happens intermittantly to us during pulls. I&#39;ve asked my wife to keep her<br/>
autoattack on even when returning to the camp to see if that helps, but it<br/>
has made no difference. Sometimes we have the right frog, sometimes not.<br/>
