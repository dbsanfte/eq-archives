<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066238056">First, thanks for the replies people have made, I hope to keep you<br/>
informed as and when I receive responses from Verant.<br/>
<br/>
In response to questions raised here, I shall try and pass on some<br/>
info that might help eliminate obvious explanations for the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I live alone, no one has access to my computer, it is a standalone not<br/>
networked other than by modem, physically turned off when not in use,<br/>
no software of a dubious nature is loaded (as mentioned elsewhere<br/>
BackOrifice/Office etc) ... I am a computer auditor by profession<br/>
(security is in the blood, sadly!) and I have quite a bit of knowledge<br/>
of computer security/logs/exploits/whatever you might want to call it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I was sleepwalking and bizarrely did this.  Maybe an obscure<br/>
burglar broke in, left all my valuables and electricals, logged on,<br/>
guessed my password, sold all my virtual gear, and then logged out and<br/>
left my home untouched.  At least that&#39;s an entertaining thought ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll log in to EQ tonight again in the hope that a GM shows up at a<br/>
reasonable hour (or at least while I&#39;m still awake and functioning!)<br/>
<br/>
And until then, I&#39;ll keep singing and playing music to raise spirits,<br/>
just like a good bard should!<br/>

&gt;Would any of your friends/relatives have or can guess your station name and <br/>
&gt;password?  Do you have a spouse that is really upset with you spending too <br/>
&gt;much time on EQ?  Maybe he/she guessed your password and gave all your stuff <br/>
&gt;away.  Did you ever visit some everquest websites which you need to create <br/>
&gt;an account with user name and password?  Are either the user name or the <br/>
&gt;password same as your EQ login ones?  Have you ever sign any EQ class <br/>
&gt;petition with your station name?  Is your password easy to guess?  Did you <br/>
&gt;make the password the same as the surname of your character?  That is the <br/>
&gt;first thing a hacker would guess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It seems like there can be only one reason.  Somehow, someone got hold of <br/>
&gt;your station name and password.  It is either thru you or thru Verant. :(<br/>
