a lot of giants and spiders, didnt pull any bears or the Magi.<br/>

However, I found a little secret entrance I had never seen before<br/>
which leads from the throne room straight to Vox&#39;s lair.  Only<br/>
a bard with levitate can make it up there.  (since our levitate<br/>
continues to make you rise up) - then I proceeded to die as<br/>
several ice giants agro&#39;d on me out of my visual range. (pretty<br/>
far radius, maybe too far)<br/>

Good learning experience.  Had about 25 level 40+ people.<br/>
