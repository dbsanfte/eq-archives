Subject: [eqbards] Anyone Out There?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just curious if this list is still alive.<br/>
<br/>
With EQSongs gone and now EQDiva looking like it will be <br/>
closing...what is really left?  I know the Concert Hall Message <br/>
boards are still there, but they are on EZBoard and I cannot access <br/>
those from my normal surf place (i.e., work has that site filtered).  <br/>
I really miss the in-depth song analysis that we used to have <br/>
available!<br/>
