<div id="ygrps-yiv-671071004">I&#39;m the highest bard in our group (at 40) which is sad since I&#39;m a part <br/>
time player. They never have a bard for raids which is just what they are <br/>
getting high enough to do. The next bard is a twink (I saw her last at 35) <br/>
so she&#39;s part time as well. I&#39;ve seen a couple of low level bards around in <br/>
our guild, but don&#39;t know whether they are full time or not. :-P<br/>
