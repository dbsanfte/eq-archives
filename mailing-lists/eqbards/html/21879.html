<div id="ygrps-yiv-813751582">Our mez song ig useful till at least lvl 30.  I say this because in my<br/>
cleric&#39;s group (which is now lvl 30) our bard still uses lullaby effectivly.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure when it becomes useless (Elfson just about never used it<br/>
because high taunt factor in pickup groups was too risky for him), but it<br/>
has some use at least.  Pixie Strike on the other hand is pretty weak for<br/>
mezzing.  Though I still love the song for its stun effect.  My guild (who I<br/>
now spend most of my time grouped with) was shocked when a healer mob bot<br/>
off a heal in combat.  &quot;Elf, what did you fall asleep there?&quot;  (I actually<br/>
didn&#39;t knwo the mob was a healer thus wasn&#39;t stunning).<br/>
<br/>
But that shows how useful that song is, my guild just assumes that every<br/>
heal is going to get interupted.  (Obviously not just me doing it).  SO that<br/>
song is still useful.<br/>
<br/>
Face the facts, we knew a month ago we would never get to mez at higher<br/>
levels.  Live with it.   I don&#39;t know why you masochistly read Gordon&#39;s<br/>
posts anymore.  You know what he&#39;s going to say.</div>
