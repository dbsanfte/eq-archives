&gt; &gt; I&#39;d recommend that you stay outta Sol A.  I have a real dislike for goblins<br/>
&gt; &gt; in general (and I try not to be bigoted), but that place has a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; serious Wizards in it and they hit very hard.  They killed me twice at level<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just to offer an opposing viewpoint on this.. I really like Sol A. With<br/>
&gt; a good group and good dungeon exploring techniques, it&#39;s a gas and quite<br/>
&gt; doable. And, because it&#39;s usually empty, it&#39;s one of the few places you<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sol A is really really bad near the entrance.  Those steps,<br/>
that lava, that hole in the wall you have to crawl through<br/>
make it probably the most dangerous entrance of any &quot;dungeon&quot;<br/>
aside from the planes.  It is much better inside.  Don&#39;t let<br/>
the entrance discourage you.<br/>
<br/>
Wizards are always a problem.  I didn&#39;t think they were any<br/>
different than casting madmen, ice goblin evokers/diviners, or<br/>
even the healers in Cazic.  Just keep your resist songs ready,<br/>
have a good healer in the party, and you should be fine.<br/>
