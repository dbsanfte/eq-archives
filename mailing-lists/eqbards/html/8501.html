&lt;&lt; Hmm, I don&#39;t recall hill giants starting to /con anything but<br/>
 yellow or red until I was level 35.  Cyclopses were blue at 30<br/>
 though (at least most of them). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And? :) I killed 4 hg&#39;s today realatively quickly (didnt time this one, was <br/>
too busy tryin not to die). And yes they were all red. As I said be <br/>
creative!! Bards are an extremely strong class is played right. Anyways, <br/>
think about it, if ya can&#39;t figure out how I do this, l&#39;ll let my secret out <br/>
:)<br/>
