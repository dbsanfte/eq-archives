<div id="ygrps-yiv-568307150">On my server, Tunare,  there is always a small handful of very experienced<br/>
Paladins/Bards that are hanging out around lvl 52 for sometimes months<br/>
waiting on thier books/scales.  So the vox/nag raids usually have very good<br/>
leadership.<br/>

I think Vox is harder than a lot of people give credit to.  On Xegony; when<br/>
I&#39;m in a place like Sebilis - I hear people &quot;dissing&quot; (on /ooc or /shout)<br/>
Vox raids where it often takes three or more chances to wipe her out.  The<br/>
people doing the dissing are often members of larger power guilds - who<br/>
spent a lot of time killing Vox at a time in the past and now the guilds are<br/>
all too-high (even with second chars to do it)<br/>
<br/>
More &quot;Mature&quot; players often respond in kind pointing out how many wipeout<br/>
said power-guild (or their predecessors - or the ones that member belonged<br/>
to at the time) had when they first went after Vox.<br/>
<br/>
Vox/Nag is usually the first Raid experience for a lot of people; so you<br/>
have inexperienced people.  A great many raids are pickup raids; so you&#39;ll<br/>
have people not used to fighting with each other fighting together.  Or<br/>
newer raids made up of newer players getting to the 46-52 range for the<br/>
first time; and inexperienced raid leaders.<br/>
<br/>
Even on a &quot;twink&quot;; an experienced raid leader will probably want to fight<br/>
something else; He&#39;ll want his 53+ friends to help; and there are places<br/>
with more loot etc.<br/>
<br/>
And for us bards doing it for scales - higher chars are very useful not just<br/>
for buffing; but I&#39;ve seen a Vox raid get wiped out (back in my 46-52 days)<br/>
when Ice Giants spawned while Vox was engaged.  If a group or two of 53+ had<br/>
been in reserve to handle that - it wouldn&#39;t have been an issue.<br/>

Hmm, I can&#39;t attest to the skill of the current Vox raiders on E&#39;ci since I<br/>
have not been on one yet but it seems to me that from what I observe (and I<br/>
keep my ears open) many of the Vox raids on our server end in wipeouts and<br/>
failures, at least ones that people I know are involved in.<br/>
<br/>
Ahh well, how much to white scales sell for on E&#39;ci these days, anyone know?<br/>
