<div id="ygrps-yiv-465378469">Err, with all due respect, I&#39;ve killed at least 3 dozen hill giants with charm at level 30 so far.  It<br/>
works just fine.  That&#39;s not to say I haven&#39;t died a lot (and I mean a LOT) getting good at it.  But I&#39;m<br/>
halfway through level 30 on giant exp alone, and have made around 1500pp from doing it.  Just don&#39;t tell<br/>
anyone!  Lest nerftdom come!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think the ability is too powerful, and could see how any other class would be extremely<br/>
jealous.  Not that I&#39;m complaining, since I&#39;m not looking forward to the higher level days when I&#39;m not<br/>
much good for anything but a mana machine.<br/>

go around in rathe mountains.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Still, I leave those groups as soon as I can.  The fact is that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are dead wrong to think that the mana song is the only useful thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I can play, and I don&#39;t like being in a group that is both stupid<br/>
&gt; &gt; and insistent that I go along with their stupidity.  Those are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups that get me killed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Amen brother, if I am getting beat down constantly, I will leave.<br/>
&gt;   But if the group is working good enough, and the exp is rolling<br/>
&gt;   in decently, with little downtime.  I&#39;ll save my bardic speech<br/>
&gt;   for another time.  I&#39;ll be the first to jet, if things suck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   In the immortal words of Beavis, &quot;Change it Butthead.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mes, it&#39;s still darned useful.  In Lower Guk (savant, exe, scribe<br/>
&gt; &gt; rooms), at level 34, I was getting about 50% resists.  This shuts<br/>
&gt; &gt; down half of the goblins<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   frogloks ;p   I&#39;ll have to return to Guk to re-evalute the song.<br/>
&gt;   In the lord room, I got my ass seriously kicked when I tried to<br/>
&gt;   sleep frogs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   No disrespect meant song brother.  Just trying to cut the illusion<br/>
&gt;   we often give of ourselves as being slightly more powerful than<br/>
&gt;   we are in reality.  After all, we are storytellers, and we have<br/>
&gt;   to make ourselves look good in the public eye.  If you didnt solo<br/>
&gt;   like 5 hill giants at once with half your hp, and two rusty<br/>
&gt;   daggers, what good are you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Just like that one bard claiming to solo hill giants using charm<br/>
&gt;   at level 30.  I think that was a pretty tall tale.  Ask Sylly how<br/>
&gt;   her charming experience went when she was doing it at level 34.<br/>
&gt;   But, hell, it sure sounded good!  Impress your friends ;-)<br/>
