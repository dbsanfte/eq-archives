<div id="ygrps-yiv-12547283">Well the greatest pity of ongoing quests in Everquest is the fact they are<br/>
few and far between and they are geared towards higher level characters.<br/>
Even mid level quests are tiresome, since a gm run quest usually amounts<br/>
to something is happening.... See gating level 50s.... see ice comet hit<br/>
the GMs... See the level 50s loot and gate out.  If there was only a way<br/>
to let quests for a specific level group remain for a specific level<br/>
group.  Oh well can&#39;t have it all ~_^.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually if its the quest I&#39;m thinking of we tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; to abort it on E&#39;ci on purpose!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And people wonder why there&#39;s not more on-going quests<br/>
&gt; in Norrath.<br/>
