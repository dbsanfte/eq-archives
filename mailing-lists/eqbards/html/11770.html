<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782733210">My hobby lately has been the rush of HG hunting solo, problem, and you will<br/>
laugh.... I need TWO, do you know how hard it is to find TWO Hill Giants<br/>
twiddling thier Fee Fi Fo Thumbs now adays?  So as of late Ive been using a<br/>
griffon instead, but the HG inevitably kills the Griffon...... and I&#39;d<br/>
rather get the Hill Giant.......... BTW this is a sight a blue flash zipping<br/>
all over the countryside, circling around two HGs taunting them something<br/>
fierce, all the /shouts, &quot;Whats that crazy Blue Bard doing&quot;? My biggest<br/>
problem is some Druid deciding to Help me by peeling one off, then me<br/>
recharming it away and saying &quot;STOP IT&quot;, all while dodging the other rather<br/>
upset Hill Giant :)<br/>

&gt;Ok, so there I was in NK with nothing to do when I sees a Griffon.  Then I<br/>
&gt;sees another Girffon.  Hmm, well I can just zone if it goes bad.  So, I<br/>
&gt;target one and equip crude stein and sing charm:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;your target is too far away...<br/>
&gt;your target is too far away...<br/>
&gt;you target is too far away...<br/>
&gt;you target is too far away...<br/>
&gt;[ nothing ]<br/>
&gt;[ nothing ]<br/>
&gt;[ nothing ]<br/>
&gt;your target resists the Song of the Sirens spell...<br/>
&gt;[ nothing ]<br/>
&gt;a grifon hits YOU for 64<br/>

&gt;Ruh roh!  Time to start moving.  So then as I am heading to the Plains of<br/>
&gt;the Western Karana, I sees old Guard Frederick killing some corrupt lion<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I train Merv onto poor old Guard Fred.  Well, old Fred starts whacking on<br/>
&gt;Merv but Merv don&#39;t care about some lame greenie whacking at him and keeps<br/>
&gt;chasing me.  So, I just keep on kiting and eventually Fred nibbles him down<br/>
&gt;and KS&#39;s him off me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So now I am thinking, hmmm, I bet I could do this with a party member and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;would get he kill and the xp??? Might have to try it sometime.  I think<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Merv might view things a little differently if a party member is slashing<br/>
&gt;his tail feathers or not?  Or charm Fred when he has Merv down to low<br/>
 </span></blockquote>health<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;- I guess that would have worked too.  I was in a risk adverse mood right<br/>
&gt;then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The day before - we tried to take a SG in S. Ro (we were after Kililji<br/>
&gt;plans.)  A lo 30&#39;s bard and a lo 30&#39;s necro and me at 38.  Well, things got<br/>
&gt;all messed up and I was beat down to low hp and the other bard got killed<br/>
&gt;and I was running for the zone.  For some reason, pathing problem or what<br/>
&gt;not, the SG got a free tele port right to me from half way across the zone.<br/>
&gt;Hit, hit, dead. Ugh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s. ya, I know I had been warned!  But sheesh!<br/>
