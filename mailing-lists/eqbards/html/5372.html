MORE ON THE GLOWING STEIN<br/>
More details for you on the stein. The new Stein of Moggok as well as being <br/>
a 7/43 1 Hand Blunt Weapon does still retain the Glowing Stein bonuses of <br/>
+10 Int +5 Dex +10 HP and +20 sv Disease.<br/>
<br/>
GM&#39;s have confirmed the Quest difficulty is also being increased when the <br/>
new item is implemented. One great side effect of this is that you can now <br/>
wield the stein in a primary melee slot (since its primary only) and be safe <br/>
from the charm-morph bug.<br/>
<br/>
This is actually an improvement of the item. Those lucky enough to have both <br/>
a Glowing Black Sphere and a Stein have hit the jackpot now. Complete safety <br/>
near charming monsters and 19 int. Combining with the Crude Stein is also <br/>
popular with Enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
I would advise getting a stein before the patch if you want one though <br/>
because Verant&#39;s definition of &quot;harder&quot; can be an understatement (eg: Plane <br/>
of Fear)<br/>
