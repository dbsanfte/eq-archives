Weee i hope this helps us out, Absor (gordo&#39;s replacement) seems to be a<br/>
bard. Could it be we might have someone represent us that has a clue now?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many of my people brag that they have been granted the best traits of their<br/>
parents. Perhaps. But we also bear the burden of that heritage. Neither<br/>
Humans nor Elves love us, yet we must find our way in their society. Often<br/>
enough this isolation breaks our spirit. We have never found our own<br/>
society, and therefore can find no place to call home. But for some, myself<br/>
included, this has been a blessing. We are not restricted by racial<br/>
boundaries, and have the pleasure to claim all of Norrath as home.&quot; <br/>

Forgive my happiness, i know bards aren&#39;t suppose to be all cheery and<br/>
affect their entourage in a positive way.<br/>
