&gt; My guild went to Plane of Hate yesterday (Monday).  A friend of <br/>
mine ran <br/>
&gt; me in since I was work-delayed, so I logged in an hour or so into <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; raid.  At the time, I had four pieces of visible blue Lambent:  <br/>
arms, <br/>
&gt; legs, chest, head.  There were two Bards up there; the senior Bard <br/>
(Jysa) <br/>
&gt; had all of her Imbrued already.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As soon as I logged on, one of our pullers handed me some <br/>
vambraces.  I <br/>
&gt; looked:  Singing Steel!  They&#39;d found it in Sebilis the night <br/>
before and <br/>
&gt; decided to give it to me!  I&#39;d heard them talking about that in <br/>
/guildsay <br/>
&gt; the night before, but I honestly thought they were yanking my chain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An hour in, some warrior greaves dropped.  The warrior who got them <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; some guild-owned Mithril Greaves; my guild decided to give them to <br/>
me, <br/>
&gt; also!  The AC is less than Lambent, but I&#39;ve been sorely lacking in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; STR department, so this was a welcome addition.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We killed Innoruuk (I went LD, even though I was staring at the <br/>
corner), <br/>
&gt; then Maestro (the Lute rotted, since both Bards there had one), and <br/>
&gt; went back to the west camp.  A few more Scorn Banshees and what <br/>
dropped? <br/>
&gt; A Bard Helm!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another hour or so, another Scorn Banshee.  What dropped?  A Bard <br/>
BP!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I went from mostly blue to no blue at all in about four hours.  <br/>
Pretty <br/>
&gt; nice day for me, I&#39;d say!  Pretty nice day for the guild as a <br/>
whole, <br/>
&gt; too.  We got about 35 drops up there total, including 4 BP/Robes <br/>
(Shaman, <br/>
&gt; Bard, Mage, Enchanter).<br/>
