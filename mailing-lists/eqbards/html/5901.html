<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-286279772"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Then keep your instruments in a bag which can be<br/>
&gt; on another hotkeyed inventory slot. This makes<br/>
&gt; swapping a lot easier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sometimes feel as though I&#39;m the only person that<br/>
plays in 800x600 video mode.. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
If you play in any mode above 640x480 (default) you<br/>
can not open bags that are in your &#39;hot key&#39; banks.<br/>
The sound of the bag opening is heard, but you can&#39;t<br/>
see it. You&#39;ll also notice that if you open your<br/>
spellbook it fills up only 640x480 of the screen. If<br/>
You return to windowed mode (default) it&#39;s also only<br/>
640x480 of the screen. The same goes for hitting &quot;I&quot;<br/>
to bring up your inventory. In 800x600 the only way<br/>
to get to your bag items is to either go into window<br/>
mode or hit I to bring up the inventory. It&#39;s EXTREMELY<br/>
annoying to say the least.</div>
