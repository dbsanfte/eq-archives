<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796077437"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Apparently the server let&#39;s you linger in the zone you are <br/>
&gt; zoning from.  I have died that way to a DVinn in my younger<br/>
&gt; days.  Zone with 2 bubbles and appear in my at my bind point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Want to hear something really bizarre? I was<br/>
going through the zone to enter the Keep in<br/>
Highpass and when I got through the zone, I<br/>
was at the zone border that goes from Kithicor<br/>
to Highpass instead of inside the Keep zone. Woops.</div>
