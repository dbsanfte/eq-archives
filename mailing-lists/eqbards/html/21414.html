<div id="ygrps-yiv-688337660">You can practice pick locks on any of the 3 locked doors in Befallen just<br/>
off West Commonlands.  Equip your lockpicks and just click on the locked<br/>
doors over and over and over.  It takes a little while to get increases, I<br/>
think it took me 2 hours total to max the skill over a few sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, although it is a pretty useless skill you can max out disarm<br/>
traps by clicking on the swinging blade trap near the entrance of sola<br/>
(solusek&#39;s eye).<br/>

Ack !!! I just found out my guild is going to take on the Hole in<br/>
Painheel tonight.<br/>
I understand a Bards Lock picking skill can be high enough to &quot;pick the<br/>
rocks&quot; and get in, so where can I go and get practice to get my skill up<br/>
?  and... what, just hold a pair of lock picks over the &quot;lock&quot; and start<br/>
using them ? Any advice is appreciated :) <br/>
 Thanks,<br/>
