<div id="ygrps-yiv-272121974">Oh i see what you&#39;re saying now. Thats peculiar, I shall go test it as<br/>
well. When I got my BoC, I compared its speed with FBSS, and didn&#39;t take<br/>
into consideration what effect it might have on our speed caps. But, I<br/>
do always sing VoV during battle and noticed no 30% boost in attack<br/>
speed when I switched from FBSS to BoC. That would seem to be very<br/>
noticable. Hrm.. I&#39;ll get back on this =)<br/>
