<br/>
The reason non-casters can&#39;t be bound to a non-city area is simple:<br/>
<br/>
they can&#39;t &quot;unbind&quot; themselves as easily as a caster can &quot;unbind&quot;<br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
If they allowed everyone the ability to be bound in any zone, and<br/>
only gave the bind ability to casters, the following &quot;abuse&quot; would<br/>
happen:<br/>
<br/>
A spellcaster would get into your group.  He gets mad about some<br/>
disagreement in the group.  The next time your group camps in some<br/>
dangerous area, he binds everyone to that spot.  He then leaves.  The<br/>
moment anyone dies, they&#39;ll find themselves in the middle of an orc<br/>
camp!  Infinite Please Loading ...  And they have to pay another<br/>
spellcaster to get bind in another spot.<br/>
<br/>
As it is, it&#39;s livable.  You just have to find a spellcaster to bind<br/>
you, and it seems there are plenty of city-zones nearby.  It also<br/>
forces players to be more careful with where they hunt, and how they<br/>
explore dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
I would still like to have a solution to all the downtime we spend<br/>
running through zones just to get our corpses.  I&#39;d also like to get<br/>
an auto-equip-armor instead of having to click the armor onto my<br/>
portrait.<br/>
<br/>
But all this should be in a gameplay forum.<br/>
