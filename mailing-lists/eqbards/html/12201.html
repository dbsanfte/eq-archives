<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487350913">I think that the part-time player can reach the higher levels, but more<br/>
slowly than the player with more hours and better resistance to the boredom<br/>
of camping.  I struggled greatly through levels 12-14 with level 15 being<br/>
the most difficult of all.  Level 15 took longer than 1-14 put together.<br/>
I&#39;d say I group about 60-70% of the time I play for experience, but contrary<br/>
to my expectations and suggestions here, I actually found soloing became a<br/>
very viable way to get experience from 18-21.  I am currently still 21st<br/>
because I haven&#39;t had time to play in a couple weeks with the holidays and<br/>
such.  I have found that if I am careful I can solo whites in S Karana and<br/>
easily solo most blues there.  I remember at 15 having trouble soloing<br/>
greens.  In just a two person group we were able to take down aviaks that<br/>
were red to us with little trouble.  same was true at level 19 with tentacle<br/>
terrors in Najena.  It will get harder around 15th, but hang in there, after<br/>
that it will get easier at least thru 21st.<br/>

I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player (maybe a couple<br/>
hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be taking longer...<br/>
Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it take longer for<br/>
each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each level, but<br/>
hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better selection of<br/>
mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or harder to level<br/>
in the early teens compared to later levels..  <br/>
Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?  I hate<br/>
camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I get bored and<br/>
leave....<br/>
<br/>
