<div id="ygrps-yiv-224599484">Agreed Sylly, which is exactly what most of us have been saying.  The &quot;most<br/>
effective&quot; bard isn&#39;t one that locks themselves into one pattern of play.<br/>
The &quot;Most effective&quot; bard is the bard that knows when to put the weapons<br/>
away and use a different tactic.  Sometimes you just dont WANT to be up<br/>
there swinging away.  It all depends on your situation, group makeup, mob<br/>
makeup, level, etc.  A truely effective bard understands that there is never<br/>
any one way to handle a situation and an extremely effective bard knows<br/>
which methods to use for each situation that comes up.<br/>
<br/>
Done arguing this thread myself ;)  It&#39;s turning into a &#39;tastes great&#39;,<br/>
&#39;less filling&#39; thread.<br/>

&gt; Sylly<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; if you want to do damage as a bard at high levels, as opposed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to group buffing, you are going to be using weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i am not singing damage songs, i am helping my group.  i am giving them<br/>
&gt; &gt; haste, mana, charming, resists, etc. in every fight.  do songs outdamage<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons?  yes.  can you use them to be the most effective bard?  no. </span></blockquote></div>
