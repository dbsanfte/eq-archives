&gt; Last night I made 26th level and got to play with the Appalling Screech.  <br/>
&gt; Man what a fun song!  My party was in Solesek&#39;s Eye and was about to leave, <br/>
&gt; no one else was in the zone so I decided to see how big a train I could <br/>
&gt; start with this song.  By the time I left I had over a dozen gobs bouncing <br/>
&gt; off me, fleeing in terror!  Then on my way out I came across 3 DE guards at <br/>
&gt; the zone to EC, so I feared them to, then shouted to the zone that their <br/>
&gt; (the Dark Elves) guards were fleeing in terror from a lone bard, haha.    I <br/>
&gt; love being a Bard :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used it to practice my brass skill in Butcherblock.  I had<br/>
about a dozen critters, including Corflunk, bouncing back and<br/>
forth.  Newbies in the area were running to me to when they<br/>
started to lose a fight - they&#39;d get a chance to heal up, and<br/>
unlike the guards, I wouldn&#39;t steal their kills.<br/>
<br/>
The best though was when I used it on Dorn.  He resisted it<br/>
like 5 times (and he&#39;s green go figure), but it finally took<br/>
and I was rewarded with the message:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dorn flees in terror!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that was worth every minute of the time it took to get<br/>
to 26. :-)<br/>
<br/>
27 is even MORE fun.  You get to make the dark elf guards<br/>
fight each other.  :-)<br/>
