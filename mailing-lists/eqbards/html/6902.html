<b>Subject:</b> RE: Petiton to replace level 14 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065886819">Like I said in the first paragraph of the original post, I posted this<br/>
&quot;petition&quot; to get some discussion going since there wasn&#39;t much posting<br/>
going on today.  I made up the potential replacement songs off the fly.  I<br/>
was hoping some of the more experienced players could come up with better<br/>
ideas.  However, if everyone is fine with keeping the 14th level song as it<br/>
is then fine by me.  One thing to remember, Verant does modify/replace<br/>
spells when the situation warrants it.  Look back at the two most recent big<br/>
patches and see how many existing spells were replaced with different ones.<br/>
Asking them to replace our 14th level song is not beyond reason.  <br/>
<br/>
We discussed a general bard petition last week.  Seems to me the vote was<br/>
split 50/50 if we even needed to worry about it.  Is anyone going to<br/>
volunteer to draft one up or is it a dead issue?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I agree, this petition is somewhat uncalled for.   we allready have a heal<br/>
&gt; song and stamina song, dont even think about getting a combined one. Thats<br/>
&gt; simply pulling teeth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; lev 34 bard that is tired of petitions which address the wrong things.<br/>
&gt; If you want to petition about something, petition about thinks like skills<br/>
&gt; that cap at 40, utterly useless like hide & forage. Our stick drum will<br/>
&gt; supposedly be fixed in the next graphical patch.<br/>
