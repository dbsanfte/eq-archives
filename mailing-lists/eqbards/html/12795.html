<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558512487">No it&#39;s not fun but that&#39;s the price you pay for playign during the week. My<br/>
main char a necro who is 50 is usually weekday only my secondaries are for<br/>
weekends. Why because it&#39;s to damn crowded now a days. It justp lain sucks.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I travel on business way too much, so I only get to play weekends and<br/>
&gt;holidays.  I got a few extra days between Xmas and New Years, here&#39;s how<br/>
&gt;they went:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wednesday - Spent a lot of time in Oasis killing specters, giants and the<br/>
&gt;occasional DW goblin.  Specters were camped, giants spawn slowly, not<br/>
&gt;much exp.  Spent a couple of hours with a tired and overeager guild group<br/>
&gt;in Paw, got run out of zone three times, not much exp.  (Those snakes are<br/>
&gt;cool, though.)  Net 1/2 bubble of 35.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thursday - Spent 8 hours at the top of 4c pyramid in Cazic.  Great group,<br/>
&gt;no deaths, last two bubbles of 35, sliver of 36.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Friday - Off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Saturday - Spent 8 hours at the top of 4c pyramid again, with a<br/>
&gt;completely different group. Great group, no deaths, got 4 plus bubbles of<br/>
&gt;36, taking me to a sliver under 37.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sunday - Most guild members who are on are in Planes, spent an hour<br/>
&gt;apiece in each of three dungeons, /auctioning for a group (no responses),<br/>
&gt;/oocing if rooms were taken (they all were), /telling the few people I<br/>
&gt;knew if they had space (they didn&#39;t, and wouldn&#39;t for hours).  Spent four<br/>
&gt;hours running around to all the places where I thinnk I can solo<br/>
&gt;something, all camped up the wazoo.  Net:  7 hours, killed three blue<br/>
&gt;things solo.  Still a sliver under 37.  How do I avoid another one of<br/>
&gt;these days?  Or is this the price I pay for having a job which didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;permit me to powerlevel my way to 50?  Am I not patient enough?  Am I<br/>
&gt;supposed to pick a dungeon and sit on my heinie for four hours until<br/>
&gt;something opens up?  Is this fun?<br/>
