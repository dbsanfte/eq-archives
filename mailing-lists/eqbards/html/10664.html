<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443675265">Just read this post on the official EQ message boards, an excellent post <br/>
from Brian Hook regarding how weapons are balanced in EQ:<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
From: &quot;Brian Hook&quot;<br/>
Since Greg brought it up, I thought I&#39;d write up something about the issue <br/>
of weapon balance and design, specifically for melee weapons. NOTE: a lot of <br/>
this is obvious.<br/>
<br/>
CLASS HIERARCHY<br/>
<br/>
The melee classes are arranged such that, from greatest damage to least <br/>
damage, the ideal layout is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1.) monk<br/>
2.) warrior/rogue<br/>
3.) shadow knight/paladin/ranger<br/>
4.) bard<br/>
5.) cleric/shaman/druid<br/>
6.) pure casters<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the monk should do the most damage since the monk has no spell <br/>
casting ability and lacks armor and HP. In addition, the monk must contend <br/>
with lack of racial bonuses (infravision, stats, etc.). After the monk the <br/>
warrior and rogue should do the next most damage since they lack the spell <br/>
casting capability of hybrids. Finally you have the hybrids that make up for <br/>
their reduced pure melee capabilities by having useful spells.<br/>
<br/>
Any weapons that allow one class to move up a rank is, by definition, <br/>
unbalanced. If a ranger could dual wield weapons capable of outdamaging (or <br/>
even approaching) a monk then you have, effectively, a superclass -- a monk <br/>
with armor and spell casting powers. The early experimental weapons that <br/>
Mathin was referring to were, in fact, woefully overpowered, but it took <br/>
some experimentation to determine to what extent.<br/>
<br/>
DUAL WIELD<br/>
<br/>
If a class is going to be dual wielding a weapon, you have to keep in mind <br/>
that there will be TWICE as many weapons for procs, stat bonuses, etc. to <br/>
take effect. So while a Sword of Wonder may have +5 STR and a Halberd of <br/>
Wonder may have +7 STR, if you can get another Sword of Wonder then the dual <br/>
wielding class has a slight advantage. Dual Wield SHOULD be better than 2HS <br/>
(rangers gave up plate to get dual wield, so in theory if you&#39;re giving up <br/>
one thing you should be gaining something, right? =) ), but not so much that <br/>
2HS isn&#39;t really viable unless you&#39;re forced into it (SK/PAL).<br/>
<br/>
Also, some weapons that seem overly powerful for 1HS (e.g. Ghoulbane) are <br/>
not as powerful as some think because they can&#39;t be dual wielded either <br/>
because they&#39;re a Lore Item or because the class restriction is on a <br/>
non-dual-wielding class. Then again, GB is also more powerful than some <br/>
think if you&#39;re in Unrest or Lower Guk.<br/>
<br/>
SPELLS<br/>
<br/>
To some extent, when balancing a weapon amongst melee classes you must keep <br/>
in mind the offensive spell capability that the hybrids classes possess. For <br/>
pure offensive spell capability a ranger rules -- Careless Lightning is <br/>
woefully underutilized, isn&#39;t resisted much, doesn&#39;t cost much mana, and <br/>
does 99 pts of DD. And it has a casting time of 2.8 seconds. Now, this <br/>
doesn&#39;t justify giving the ranger worse weapons than, say, an SK or a <br/>
paladin, but it&#39;s always something to keep in mind.<br/>
<br/>
BUFFS<br/>
<br/>
When weapons (or any type of adjustments) are considered, appropriate buffs <br/>
MUST be considered at all times. This means ATK buffs, STR/DEX buffs, damage <br/>
shields, and haste buffs. While this tends to put soloers or melee types in <br/>
groups with no buffers (bard/shaman/enchanter) at a disadvantage, the other <br/>
option would be to make the weapons good for soloing but immensely powerful <br/>
in the hands of a buffed melee class. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t make weapons <br/>
that are weaker in groups and more powerful solo =/<br/>
<br/>
HOW UNBALANCED IS IT?<br/>
<br/>
This brings up a slightly related issue -- &quot;how unbalanced is it?&quot; If you <br/>
have a very powerful weapon -- say, a 20/20 -- how unbalanced is it? Will a <br/>
ranger dual wielding 20/20 daggers be able to solo Lower Guk? No. Not even <br/>
close. Will 6 rangers dual wielding 20/20 daggers be able to eat Lower Guk <br/>
alive? Quite possibly. The difference is that in the best case you have a 3x <br/>
damage gain, but with a single ranger you have made him into a party of <br/>
three (modulo lack of mana and stun effects that have a greater effect than <br/>
in a party). That&#39;s a BEST case.<br/>
<br/>
But say you have 6 rangers dual wielding 20/20 daggers....uh oh, that&#39;s like <br/>
having up to 18 rangers running amok in a single group but with the size of <br/>
6. THAT is unbalancing.<br/>
<br/>
So a lot of times you&#39;ll see someone (like Mathin =) ) complain that a <br/>
weapon got nerfed on test server. And yes, that weapon was PERFECT for him <br/>
in a three person group without a buffer. But if that weapon had been <br/>
allowed to exist on a live server you WOULD see packs of groups consisting <br/>
of 3 rangers, a cleric, a shaman, and an enchanter taking over an entire <br/>
zone. So we have to consider mass propagation of the item and how it affects <br/>
the world and groups.<br/>
<br/>
WEIGHT<br/>
<br/>
If you make a weapon lightweight, then that affects its power, even if only <br/>
slightly. It causes fatigue, especially if dual wielding. However, a weapon <br/>
that is too heavy may be unrealistically heavy for some of the weaker races <br/>
(e.g. a WT: 12 2HS may be a bit much for an erudite paladin). Once again, <br/>
it&#39;s a balancing act -- make it accessible to small races (if that&#39;s your <br/>
goal), but not so light that it imposes no burden on your stamina (unless <br/>
that&#39;s your goal).<br/>
<br/>
STAT BONUSES<br/>
<br/>
You have to be careful with stat bonuses...a DEX bonus on a weapon with a <br/>
powerful proc may be a little overly dangerous. In addition, some stats are <br/>
perceived to be more relevant than others: CHA is a &quot;don&#39;t care&quot;, whereas <br/>
STR/DEX/AGI are a big thing. Gameplay aspects aside, this is an issue since <br/>
it affects the perceived value of a weapon. Which is better, a 7/22 w/ +4 <br/>
STR or a 7/21 that&#39;s &quot;normal&quot;? The 7/22, duh. But what if it was a 7/22 w/ <br/>
+10 CHA? +1 DEX? +5 AGI? +9 STA? Decisions, decisions...and note, these <br/>
decisions are what give the world a sense of richness in items, we don&#39;t <br/>
want everything to be a no brainer. So if a no-brainer shows up, then it had <br/>
better be on purpose, otherwise the &quot;weaker&quot; of two items will never be <br/>
quested/looted, which then tends to concentrate players on the &quot;stronger&quot; of <br/>
the items.<br/>
<br/>
No brainer: 7/21 or 7/22 w/ +10 STR<br/>
Questionable: 7/21 or 6/19 w/ +2 DEX<br/>
<br/>
EFFECTS ON CAMPING<br/>
<br/>
If an item is dropped, the more people that can use it, the more camped it <br/>
will be. This is what causes problems for some of the most camped items in <br/>
the game: GZ, rubicite, Ykesha, Barbed Whip, Dragoon Dirk, Manastone, <br/>
JBoots, etc. You start finding items that aren&#39;t as generally useful: <br/>
Bullsmasher, Dark Reaver (SKs are rare), SBD (rogues are rare), bard only <br/>
items, etc. then you&#39;ll see that they&#39;re not as camped.<br/>
<br/>
A CLASS: MAG item that is very powerful still won&#39;t be as camped as a much <br/>
weaker item usable by all pure casters.<br/>
<br/>
PROCS<br/>
<br/>
When designing a proc, you have to keep in mind that depending on the class, <br/>
race, and buffs, the proc may never happen or it may happen all the time. <br/>
For example, any weapon that can be used by a rogue MUST have its proc <br/>
considered carefully, since you can expect rogues, with appropriate buffs, <br/>
to have DEX that approaches 250 at high levels. So a proc that is fine for <br/>
an ogre warrior is probably WAY too powerful for a wood elf rogue.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t count on procs to occur -- the odds can be tilted for or against <br/>
you, but either way, you still can&#39;t rely on it -- so rarely will you want <br/>
to put in a proc that you are hoping will balance out poor weapon stats. <br/>
That&#39;s a fine line...what&#39;s better, a 7/21 weapon or a 7/26 with a 150 pt DD <br/>
proc? The answer? It depends.<br/>
The most reliable procs are self-only buffs and direct damage procs.<br/>
Self-only buffs that stack are very nice, or if they do something like heal, <br/>
cure disease, invigor, etc. they are even better. Direct damage procs <br/>
obviate the need to be concerned about stacking. Some procs, such as DoTs or <br/>
damage shields or hastes, etc. are problematic because if they are castable <br/>
then will likely not stack with a higher level party member&#39;s better spell <br/>
in that same line (Ensnaring Roots comes to mind...). Since <br/>
movement-altering spells don&#39;t stack, any proc (castable or proc-only) that <br/>
affects movement may be inordinately resisted.<br/>
<br/>
Procs that help you and hurt someone else must also be balanced carefully. <br/>
Soul Leech comes to mind -- a 50 point DD is less powerful than a 50 point <br/>
Lifetap.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you&#39;re looking at the weapon as a soloists weapon, any proc at all <br/>
(except AoE) is considered a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
RACE<br/>
<br/>
Given equal weapons, a gnome warrior will be constantly outdamaged by an <br/>
ogre warrior. So if a weapon feels balanced in the hands of a gnome<br/>
warrior, then it is probably too powerful in the hands of an ogre warrior. <br/>
You can use one of two philosophies that address this issue:<br/>
<br/>
- ogres will always outdamage a gnome, so too bad. That was a choice the <br/>
player made when creating their character. The downside to this is that at <br/>
higher levels the &quot;non-ideal&quot; melee class (from a pure statistical basis) <br/>
feels that they&#39;ve been screwed and you see a lot of &quot;I should&#39;ve been a <br/>
[different race/class], and if I had known that I would have sucked at this <br/>
level, I wouldn&#39;t have gone this far&quot;. This is a fairly common complaint <br/>
for, say, human SKs and erudite paladins. And unfortunately for these <br/>
players, a lot of them didn&#39;t figure out they were powergamers until after <br/>
they started playing EQ =)<br/>
<br/>
- create weapons that are balanced assuming they are going to be given to an <br/>
appropriate race. For example, a 7/19 in the hands of a gnome may be about <br/>
the same as a 7/21 in the hands of an ogre. So you make a Gnomish Blade that <br/>
is 7/19 and RACE: GNM. The downside to this is that you see a homogenization <br/>
of the race/class combinations where everyone does about the same damage at <br/>
high levels regardless of race or class. Bullsmasher is an example of this, <br/>
but it is not unbalanced since A.) there aren&#39;t that many DWF/HLF/GNM melee <br/>
types; B.) it&#39;s non-magic; and C.) 1HB isn&#39;t commonly used by melee types.<br/>
<br/>
In some excessive cases I think that some class/race combinations should get <br/>
questable items that make them not completely underpowered versus another <br/>
race, especially at mid to high levels. But once again, this should be, at <br/>
most, to achieve parity, and in some cases just to make sure that one race <br/>
doesn&#39;t suffer so much that they&#39;re not perceived as non-viable.<br/>
<br/>
SKILL<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you can make a weapon that is slightly better than you&#39;d expect <br/>
simply because it uses a rarer skill -- 1HB and piercing come to mind, <br/>
specifically for classes that traditionally use 2HS and 1HS like rangers, <br/>
SKs, paladins, and warriors.<br/>
<br/>
DIFFICULTY TO ACQUIRE<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, difficulty to acquire an item can rarely be used to balance <br/>
an item&#39;s power, unless you make it a rare drop off a rare mob (which <br/>
frustrates players that feel they MUST have that item, even if that item is <br/>
too good given the level). The main reason for this is that you have to <br/>
assume that on a mature server that the item will have propagated to <br/>
everyone that can use it. As much as people complain about how hard it is to <br/>
get JBoots, rubicite, etc. you still see an awful lot of people running <br/>
around with JBoots and rubicite.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, however, you may wish to make a pair of quested 1HS slightly <br/>
more powerful than a quested 2HS since it took twice as long to get the pair <br/>
of 1HS (in theory). This is fair, so long as the difference between the two <br/>
isn&#39;t such that it&#39;s a no-brainer to dual wield the weapons and thus <br/>
everyone ignores the 2HS quest altogether.<br/>
<br/>
DIFFERENTIATION<br/>
<br/>
As you see, a lot of the art comes down to making things different but<br/>
equally viable. This is a very tough thing to do, be it weapons, spells, or <br/>
character class design. The smallest difference may, over time, become a <br/>
huge issue with regards to gameplay or balance. You take an item as innocent <br/>
as the Guise of the Deceiver, JBoots, or the Manastone that, at first <br/>
glance, don&#39;t seem to be THAT big a deal, then you see how their effects are <br/>
used to bypass a lot of the challenges (or requirements to group with <br/>
others) in the game, and then you realize how broken something is.<br/>
Same thing with resurrection and leaving corpses around for a week so a <br/>
cleric could res you for teleportation; res you to regain experience; etc.<br/>
<br/>
Things like this come into play all the time with weapon design. For<br/>
example, on a blank piece of paper Dismiss Summoned and Dismiss Undead are <br/>
pretty much equal. In Norrath, however, undead are far more prevalent than <br/>
summoned creatures. So a weapon with Dismiss Summoned isn&#39;t nearly as <br/>
powerful as a weapon with Dismiss Undead. And by the same token, if <br/>
Ghoulbane proced an anti-EVERYTHING proc, it would be very powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes something is provably better or worse than something else, but <br/>
conventional wisdom (&quot;Norrathian legend&quot;) will tell you otherwise. This <br/>
hinders us since we&#39;ll balance something knowing that there&#39;s a &quot;secret&quot; to <br/>
unlocking its full potential, but people may not have discovered it yet. For <br/>
example, you&#39;ll see someone saying &quot;this skill/spell/item sucks!&quot; and what <br/>
you want to say is &quot;But you don&#39;t get it, if you simply do THIS, that <br/>
skill/spell/item is twice as effective!&quot; But we can&#39;t do that because then <br/>
we&#39;re in the position of providing spoilers.<br/>
<br/>
CONCLUSION<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this gives you some insight into how tricky designing some items <br/>
can be. It&#39;s both an art and a science -- you have to have an intuitive feel <br/>
for the interactions between everything (race, procs, stat bonuses, classes, <br/>
skill caps, etc.) and then you have to back up your gut instincts by running <br/>
simulations so that the numbers do, in fact, add up to what you expect. Then <br/>
you have to see how it all fits into the world with regards to real world <br/>
usefulness (is that proc really relevant? Do these races really use this? Is <br/>
there another weapon that&#39;s similar and easier to get?) and hope you made <br/>
the right decision.<br/>
