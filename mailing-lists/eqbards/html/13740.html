The waddling elves.. or rather the waddling bards.. IS the animation fix.<br/>
The surfing was what we used to do and what most bards actually liked<br/>

&gt; Got this off casters realm. Yay! no more waddling elves<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whilst no reason has been given for the patch done late last night, a<br/>
&gt; number of things have emerged from it.<br/>
&gt; Crippling Force is now in as a special for the Warrior class. It works like<br/>
&gt; critical hits and randomly goes off for what appears to be simply some<br/>
&gt; bonus damage (+25 at level 50).<br/>
&gt; Bards have had an animation fix and now sing while running instead of<br/>
&gt; gliding across the land while playing their instruments.<br/>
&gt; The SB Live fix went in, although it is apparently dependent on also having<br/>
&gt; the latest SB Live drivers.<br/>
