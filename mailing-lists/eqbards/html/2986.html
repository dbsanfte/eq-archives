<b>Subject:</b> Tick and pulse and Accelerando <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-276452632">Ok, I took my own advice and timed these.  From pressing the<br/>
song button to when the song effect kicks in is 3.5 seconds<br/>
(did this several times and got 3.5 seconds each time).  For<br/>
pulsed songs (Accelerando, Restoration, etc), the delay<br/>
between pulses is 6.0 seconds (timed 5 pulses).<br/>
<br/>
So in theory, you could twist:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;pre&gt;<br/>
  t     t&#39;<br/>
 0.0    -   Push 1st song button<br/>
 3.5   0.0  1st song effect kicks in, stop song<br/>
 4.0   0.5  Start 2nd song<br/>
 7.5   4.0  2nd song effect kicks in, stop song<br/>
 8.0   4.5  Start 3rd song<br/>
 9.5   6.0  1st song pulses for second time<br/>
11.5   8.0  3rd song effect kicks in, stop song<br/>
12.0   8.5  Start 4th song<br/>
15.5  12.0  4th song effect kicks in, 1st song pulses 3rd time<br/>
16.0  12.5  Start 1st song<br/>
19.5  16.0  1st song effect kicks in 2 sec ahead of &quot;4th&quot; pulse<br/>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So given a really fast computer, connection, and perfect<br/>
timing, you should be able to twist 4 songs and still have <br/>
2 seconds to spare. :-)  Hmm, maybe I should put a metronome<br/>
next to my computer...<br/>
<br/>
I also did some more Accelerando timings at level 25.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;pre&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Effect  speed time<br/>
Normal  1.00  1.00  (baseline)<br/>
Selo&#39;s  1.38  0.73  (L21, no drum)<br/>
Selo&#39;s  1.375 0.727 (L25, no drum)<br/>
SoW     1.39  0.72  (L20 druid)<br/>
Selo&#39;s  1.64  0.61  (L21, with drum)<br/>
Selo&#39;s  1.70  0.59  (L25, with drum)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>
