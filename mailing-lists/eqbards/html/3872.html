<div id="ygrps-yiv-377662432">&lt;g&gt; You may want to check out everfrost... some of the recent additions<br/>
include vengeful lyrist, vengeful composer, and vengeful soloist (can&#39;t<br/>
remember exactly) but they drop pages from a diary of which go away on log<br/>
off) from someone (guessing a bard of that I can&#39;t remember). These undead<br/>
skelatons con green to me at 20 and will still attack (terrorize the young<br/>
shamens and barbarians).  But due to their recent addion, and these pages of<br/>
diary that they drop may hold some key to the quest that you are speaking<br/>
of.... (new item, new beasts, Lute of Gypsy Princess, vengeful soloists&#39;..<br/>
only drawing un-educated conlcusions).  It may offer help to check everfrost<br/>
out for that or maybe another bard quest.. I don&#39;t know.. Ideas?<br/>

ps.. btw Whenever anyone would like to drop some medium bronze my way, go<br/>
right ahead (whould trade an archielogist bag and other junk) .. and I love<br/>
the little (rather large sometimes) goblin trains of Permafrost.. such a<br/>
great zone :P</div>
