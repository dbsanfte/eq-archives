<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091488092">I thought I would contribute a little to this thread, I have been in lurk<br/>
mode for some time since I read this list at work and rarely have the time<br/>
these days to post any significant messages.<br/>
<br/>
I am level 48 now and have been spending the past couple weeks powerleveling<br/>
in Dreadlands around Karanor&#39;s castle trying to make the mad rush to 50. I<br/>
spent about 2 months in level 45 and decided to just buckle down and tear<br/>
through the last five levels, especially when I found out how great the xp<br/>
was in the Dreadlands.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what happened last night:<br/>
<br/>
Generally I am now an advocate of the support bard position, singing with<br/>
instruments and punching with fists if I get involved in the melee at all. I<br/>
was in a pretty well balanced group for most of the night and made about 1/2<br/>
a bubble of level 48 xp in 4 hours, not great but not terrible either.  Due<br/>
to the domino affect, one person went to bed and 2 others followed so I<br/>
began to recruit and our entire group balance suddenly changed to the<br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
1 level 48 Paladin<br/>
1 level 37 Cleric<br/>
1 level 45 Cleric<br/>
1 level 50 Druid<br/>
1 level 45 Enchanter<br/>
Me (level 48 bard)<br/>
<br/>
Since we had such an odd mix of classes and only 1 melee type with no one<br/>
who could snare, I switched to weapons and loaded chains/fear.  With the<br/>
enchanter&#39;s clarity, the shaman&#39;s buffs, and my clarity we were a veritable<br/>
meat grinder.  We had non-stop pulls, no &quot;OOM&quot; and I got as much xp in 1<br/>
hour that had just taken 4 hours to get, 1/2 a bubble at 48 in one hour!  <br/>
<br/>
Not only that, everyone in the group was happy, playing their role well and<br/>
constantly saying how much fun they were having.  The only complaint was<br/>
from the shaman who finally said he was going to give up DOT&#39;ing since the<br/>
mobs were dying before he even had a chance to get the spell off most of the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
In this group my role was clarity in downtime and chains/fear during battle<br/>
with a curtailing chant and/or chant of fire thrown in when possible.  I had<br/>
to concentrate on making sure chains/fear would stick so I had to almost<br/>
exclusively sing those two songs, which is why I stuck my weapons in hand<br/>
and contributed a little extra melee damage.  YES chains was resisted a lot<br/>
more than I would have liked and occasionally broke a lot sooner than I<br/>
would have liked, but overall it was a very effective strategy in this group<br/>
composition.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to reinforce the point that we are an extremely versatile class<br/>
and even though our contributions are often not readily visible we ARE (as<br/>
someone recently mentioned) kind of the &quot;glue&quot; that sticks a group together<br/>
at times.  By chain/fearing I was able to keep the overall group damage down<br/>
to a minimum and allow the casters to just carelessly shoot off their big<br/>
nukes with little concern of retaliation.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the and enchanter and I got along just grand ;-)<br/>
