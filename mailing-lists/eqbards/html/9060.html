<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309276479">Hey I know, since MOB&#39;s are known to attack targets they perceive as<br/>
vulnerable, maybe the derv thought, hey its a bard and he&#39;s not singing any<br/>
songs, he must be an easy target!<br/>
<br/>
A good thought, but unfortunately this will not prevent bard-hate.  I have<br/>
several times been attacked when our ranger pulled and I was singing no<br/>
songs, making no attacks.  The mob would just rush past the ranger and the<br/>
other group members and smack me.  This was back when we were attempting to<br/>
prevent my being the main focus of mobs.  Nowadays the cleric loves it when<br/>
I am around.  Normally he has to keep switching targets between the other<br/>
three tanks he groups with regularly because they take turns getting the<br/>
heck beat out of them.  When I&#39;m around he can just target me and happily<br/>
cast away.  None of the other tanks ever get below 2 bubbles despite being<br/>
lower level with armor classes 100 points lower.  I usually end up with all<br/>
the mobs concentrating on me.<br/>
<br/>
I have a new good example of bard hate.  I am standing still with a trade<br/>
window open singing no songs on the hill near the derv camp.  A ranger<br/>
shoots the lead derv with his bow from out in the plains area.  The derv<br/>
rushes forward, stops and runs over and backstabs me despite my not even<br/>
being in the rangers group, nor in the mobs aggro radius.  If someone can<br/>
explain that away to normal mob dynamics I&#39;d love to hear it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.. this is precisely what is causing it.   The reason bards seem to be in<br/>
a lot of these situations is because they&#39;re usually constantly buffing<br/>
everyone all the time.  For an experiment, pull something w/o singing any<br/>
songs.  Have any nearby caster buff anyone in the party just as the MOB is<br/>
coming into range.  Chances are the MOB will bee-line towards the caster (I<br/>
just saw this multiple times lastnight when a druid would buff damage<br/>
shields at the beginning of a pull - the MOB invariably went straight at the<br/>
druid)<br/>
