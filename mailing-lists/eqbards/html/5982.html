<div id="ygrps-yiv-213535701">does sound fishy.  all of the other magical instruments (mistmoore battle<br/>
drums, selo&#39;s drum of march) only add to the songs, don&#39;t give stat boosts<br/>
as well.  would be nice though.  something this good would probably have to<br/>
come off cazic-thule or a dragon though.  now we need a bard-only weapon!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; almost sounds like a hoax, it just seems too good to be true, <br/>
&gt; dex boost and<br/>
&gt; the charisma boost... and the brass 15%.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i&#39;ll beleive it when i have one in my hands, untill then i <br/>
&gt; will treat this<br/>
&gt; thing as a hoax<br/>
