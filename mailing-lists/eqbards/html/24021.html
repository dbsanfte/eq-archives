&gt;once every 40 minutes (the longest timer of any effect in the game, if I&#39;m not mistaken), it should, in at<br/>
&gt;least some small number of expected circumstances, have a significant effect.  It doesn&#39;t.  By the time<br/>
&gt;you get it, the amount of damage it does is inconsequential to the eventual outcome of any fight, and is<br/>
&gt;actually much more likely to be detrimental due to the AE component (which wakes up anything mezzed)<br/>
&gt;coupled with the ludicrous resists (which wakes up anything mezzed, frequently without damaging them in<br/>
&gt;the slightest).  And the level increases that Verant gave to this song are laughably small compared to the<br/>
&gt;increased HP total of higher-level MOBs.  They really have no clue.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t believe resists wake up enc mezzed targets.  i know for a fact that resists don&#39;t wake up bard mezzed<br/>
targets because i have been power levelling my wizard on some mobs by mezzing, then nuking and timing<br/>
my mez so it goes off immediately after the nuke.  when the wizard&#39;s spell is resisted, the mob does not<br/>
move and i don&#39;t get a message indicating song of twilight has worn off.  and i still have seen no evidence<br/>
of &#39;&#39;ludicrous resists&#39;&#39;.  i used the song quite a bit back when i first got it, and never had a problem with resists.<br/>
i&#39;ve used it recently on big raids where i can pretty much do whatever i want without affecting the outcome of<br/>
the raid and don&#39;t get to charm very much, and haven&#39;t had a problem sticking it on things.<br/>
