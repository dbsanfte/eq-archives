&gt; Try it on yourself.  Most of the time you will get the &quot;you<br/>
&gt; send forth music&quot; message and icon, but will not be stunned.  <br/>
&gt; If you wait for the icon to disappear, you will get the &quot;you<br/>
&gt; are no longer stunned&quot; message even though you were never<br/>
&gt; stunned!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It *is* broken.<br/>

&gt; it is not broken!  I used it in lguk 2 days ago.  We were over swarm by 3<br/>
&gt; mobs.  So I used pixie strike on one of them and he was standing still for<br/>
<br/>

often enough or get lucky on your first try, it *will* work<br/>
like it&#39;s supposed to.  The part that&#39;s broke is that about<br/>
60%-70% of the time, it will not be resisted, you get the<br/>
&quot;glaze&quot; message, and it will have no effect.  That&#39;s why I<br/>
said to try it on yourself - you will see the icon appear on<br/>
your screen, and absolutely nothing will happen.<br/>

&gt; The thing is you must stop fighting it and back off for the song to work.<br/>
&gt; But it  seems the duration is very unpredictable but the songs works.  I<br/>
&gt; also tried it on HG and it works too.  When I was in Rathe Mtn, I<br/>
&gt; accidentally pull 2 so I pixie on 1 and ran by real fast and it just stood<br/>
&gt; there and eventually I lost the HG.  it does work but not very reliable.<br/>
&gt; You just have to keep doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is not a random duration thing either.  The icon on your<br/>
screen disappears when the spell effect expires, whether it&#39;s<br/>
1 second or 10 seconds.  But with the bug, the icon appears on<br/>
your screen and you get a message saying &quot;you are unstunned&quot;<br/>
when the icon disappears, despite never having been stunned to<br/>
begin with.<br/>
<br/>
Try it on yourself before you argue otherwise.  I&#39;m not making<br/>
this up, I&#39;ve played with it extensively for the last week or<br/>
two.  It *is* broken.  This used to be my favorite song before<br/>
they broke it.  I don&#39;t even keep it loaded now.<br/>
