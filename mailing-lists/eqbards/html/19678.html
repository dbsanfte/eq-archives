<div id="ygrps-yiv-80086589">Gate would be a nice effect to drop off a level 20 mob.  It does drop off<br/>
level 35ish mobs (the cenobite? in CT? And PoF mobs too drop a wand with a<br/>
gate.) And they need to make Shaman potions reasonable - to make and to buy.<br/>
But its a low level spell.<br/>
<br/>
At high levels, folks do not use gate as a &quot;get out of jail free card.&quot;  Not<br/>
if they ever want to get invited to plane/dragon/dungeon again.  The stuff<br/>
you do is group oriented.  Druids and Wizards transport folks - before and<br/>
after.  You wont be hurting for transport if you are playing with guild<br/>
groups.  And a gate to your bind point is merely a very occasional<br/>
convenience.  Gate without bind - is ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Something good would be a heal or buff.  A real heal or a good buff even if<br/>
it used reagents.<br/>

p.s. I&#39;d take summon bandages over gate<br/>

p.s.s. Sorry, Gordon or GZ might hear that!<br/>

&gt; Too bad the rumour that all the melee and hybrid BP&#39;s had Gate, I was<br/>
&gt; looking forward to that. </span></blockquote></div>
