<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563917988">What would the mob be resisting?  The group was monk, cleric, bard.  I guess<br/>
the MR resist would help keep chains stuck on the mob, but that seems<br/>
wasteful.  The damage on Fufils is trival compared with the haste effect on<br/>
the monk (and also the bard).  As for the dam shield, if there was more than<br/>
one mob awake, then the bard better be dealing with it.<br/>
<br/>
A good bard looks at his (or her) group and figures what would best suit the<br/>
group.  Perhaps even experimenting early on.<br/>

&gt; choices were available) but they are not that far off base:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also reduces the mob&#39;s<br/>

&gt; Psalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk and the damage<br/>
&gt; shield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>
