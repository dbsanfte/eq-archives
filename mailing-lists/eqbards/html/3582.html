for pelts to make patchwork to sell or give to cool newbies.  I was amazed<br/>
to see so high-level a bard there, where I&#39;m a bit out of place at 15th.<br/>
Checking him closer I found he was 3rd level.  He probably became anonymous<br/>
after he started the constant auction for rare, expensive items.<br/>
<br/>
Some friends and I are starting new characters so we can play together at<br/>
the same level.  We&#39;ve passed a bit of equipment down to them, but nothing<br/>
that would be really noticable as immensely out of line.  It&#39;s hard to draw<br/>
the line between reasonable help extended to new characters, whether<br/>
stranger, friend, or your own, and outright twinking, but there does seem<br/>
to be a line.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a friend who has concentrated heavily on fletching.  He&#39;s made<br/>
a lot of money and gotten some fairly nice equipment in trade or from<br/>
grateful customers, so he could appear a little twinked to a casual<br/>
observer, but in fact he&#39;s worked for it.  He&#39;s 7th level and I&#39;m 15th.  We<br/>
group sometimes and I act as his body guard and purchasing agent.  With me<br/>
he can go more dangerous places to sell his nice bows, and I can get way<br/>
better prices on expensive materials, on which I get a commission.  So he&#39;s<br/>
a legitimate business elf and I&#39;m a legitimate partner.  Today I even acted<br/>
as agent for him, since I had time and Selo-speed, and sold a very<br/>
expensive bow in Freeport, to good profit for both of us.  He made it and I<br/>
sold it to another player, all up front and legit.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s clear why you mostly can&#39;t make clear, solid rules, but it does seem<br/>
there should be some sort of limits.<br/>
