<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824795153">Hmm...I think you may be waaay optimistic on some of those.  :)<br/>
<br/>
*** Not optimistic at all!  Verant will quickly realize that closer bind<br/>
points unbalance the caster/melee class and therefore (and yes, I&#39;m<br/>
kidding) they will put all the new bind spots directly on mobs&#39; paths and<br/>
spawn points.<br/>
<br/>
Lavastorm = No - I think they&#39;ll crank up the xp modifier for Najena, and<br/>
make it worth being bound in FP for the light races to take the risk.<br/>
Other<br/>
than that, it&#39;s too close to Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
*** I figure with both Najena and Solusek in there it stands a chance of<br/>
getting a bind point.  Unless you can bind in Solusek...dunno I&#39;m just a<br/>
newbie.<br/>
<br/>
South Karana = Unk - No if they reason that Arena is only 2 zone lines<br/>
away.<br/>
Yes if they decide it&#39;s too hard to get a bind in Arena, since there is<br/>
normally nobody in there.<br/>
<br/>
*** I was also thinking of folks hunting in the Karanas who currently use<br/>
highpass or qeynos because they&#39;re too young to safely reach the arena.  I<br/>
think someone else also mentioned this.<br/>
<br/>
Lfay = No - Only 1 zone away from Gfay, and the spires.  Although the<br/>
pathing is broke, they could probably even get away without increasing the<br/>
xp modifier for Mistmoore.  It&#39;s always been relatively popular despite<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
faults.<br/>
<br/>
*** Yeah, you&#39;re probably right.<br/>
<br/>
Feeroot = No - Only 1 zone away from Cazic Thule.  Too close.<br/>
<br/>
*** Didn&#39;t know you could bind in CT.  &lt;/shrugs&gt;  I&#39;m just a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
Innothule = Yes - Despite being only 1 zone from Upper Guk, it is a good<br/>
midpoint between arena and Freeport.  Will perhaps be a &quot;camp&quot; of some<br/>
type,<br/>
with light aligned guards?  The points for, taking into consideration the<br/>
zones around it, to me seem to outweight the points against, regarding the<br/>
proximity to Lguk.<br/>
<br/>
*** Actually I had this on my &quot;not so likely&quot; list originally.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
about your server, but Guk&#39;s pretty active on Tunare from what I hear.  If<br/>
bind points are going in to encourage travelling to underused zones,<br/>
Innothule would probably be quite low on the list of possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
All of Odus = No - Between Erud for the lights, and Paineel for the darks,<br/>
nothing needed.<br/>
<br/>
*** Due to the boat ride, I still hold Erud&#39;s Crossing could get one.  Most<br/>
times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve been alone.<br/>
<br/>
(Befallen is avoided, not because of binding issues, but because it&#39;s a<br/>
death trap with little reason to try.)<br/>
<br/>
*** Avoided??  Why Belfallen is full of lockpicking rogues! ;^)<br/>
<br/>
*** In my opinion, if Belfallen were closer to a newbie&#39;s bind point it<br/>
would get used more.  I haven&#39;t fought in it much, but it didn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
any more of a death trap than Blackburrow.<br/>
<br/>
Everfrost = Yes - A dark aligned camp would be most likely, since light<br/>
aligned folks can bind in Halas.<br/>
<br/>
*** Good point.  Forgot about the evil folks.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Evulia, newbie of Tunare</div>
