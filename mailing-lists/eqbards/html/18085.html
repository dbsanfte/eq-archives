<div id="ygrps-yiv-606503697">Happy Easter, everyone!  Just in time for this wonderful holiday, I present <br/>
to you a website dedicated to all the little inside jokes, pop-culture <br/>
references, and humourous oddities - in other words, the Easter Eggs of <br/>
Everquest.  I call the site EasterQuest!  Warning!!! There are some <br/>
spoilers, so if you don&#39;t want to be spoiled like last years eggs that were <br/>
never found (ewwwww....) don&#39;t stop by.  For the rest of you:<br/>
<br/>
Onward to Easterquest! (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/easterquest.htm)">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/easterquest.htm)</a><br/>
