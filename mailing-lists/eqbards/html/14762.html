<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155295502">I know what you mean about the crazy pulls... <br/>
Was in the Savant room last night (got a BEM yay!), and our group saw all<br/>
manner of things run past us.  Minos, huge clusters of frogs, and even an<br/>
EE!  I&#39;m not to well versed on the layout of Lower yet (getting there tho!)<br/>
but i believe it was the Cavalier group who was pulling.  People like to<br/>
get a reputation as being a good puller by pulling crap from live side to<br/>
dead side.  Heck, once I was grouped with a Paly (can&#39;t remember his name)<br/>
who was a damned good puller.  He bragged that he once pulled something<br/>
from upper guk! lol! <br/>
