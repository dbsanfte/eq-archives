<div id="ygrps-yiv-430211530">I am 100% like Harmonic in this case. I _WELCOME_ any lower level player asking<br/>
me questions. I find it to be one of the best parts of the game, helping and<br/>
teaching people how to play, as well as showing them neat tricks and tactics.<br/>
<br/>
If I am too busy fighting, or chatting with other people, I will tell them that,<br/>
but that I will get back to them as soon as possible.<br/>

On that note.. speaking of gods and planes and such... the following is from<br/>

&lt;Aradune&gt; no, Bill&#39;s added a bunch of new gods to the pantheon. lesser gods<br/>
&lt;Aradune&gt; who reside in the plane of heroes<br/>

&gt; You are different.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have seen too many high level rants about stupid lower levels. Even my<br/>
&gt; friend does it sometimes, after a particularly frustrating night. And I<br/>
&gt; never ever want to be seen in that light.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; However, I do know that I am unsure about /tell&#39;ing people that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; high, unless I know them in particular. Because I do not want<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to be seen as one of those annoying lower levels always bothering,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  That&#39;s the beauty of it, I don&#39;t care who it is ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I answer all the questions that people ask of me.  You never know<br/>
&gt; &gt;  who it could be.  It may be a friend on as a secondary toon.<br/>
