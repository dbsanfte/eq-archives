So there I was trying to do a Shining Star of Light quest (dont ask).  And<br/>
ran into a friend who had started a new monk so I am trying to help him get<br/>
level 3.  I see Nixx DarkPaw run by and think, hmm... I can beat him to a<br/>
sliver and use Sirens to wipe the damage list.  But apparently Nixx agro&#39;d<br/>
the Qeynos guard and I somehow managed to stick a charm on him before he<br/>
died.  And only moments later, I was dead too! Hehe, crazy bards never<br/>
learn.<br/>

p.s. If you find Lempich (sp?) the guy usually on the roof of his barn along<br/>
the river in West Karana, sitting inside his barn, that may be a clue that<br/>
he is too sick to be cured.  Ie, you give him the potion and he attacks you!<br/>
Other theory is that at night he is a &#39;werewolf&#39; because he has been bitten.<br/>
And that&#39;s what happened to me - he attacked.  Now, I could have easily<br/>
zoned him but instead I killed him to see if maybe he would drop that &#39;rusty<br/>
sycthe&#39; needed for the quest but alas only some thing for the necro or sk<br/>
quest? Some other class kills him for that item.</div>
