Bit of a disclaimer on what I posted:  we both thought it seemed as if we<br/>
were suddenly moving a LOT faster than we had been.  But we couldn&#39;t be<br/>
absolutely 100% certain how fast we were going.  She camped shortly after &<br/>
I zoned.  When I came out on the other side I still had SOW in effect, but<br/>
not Accelerado and I&#39;d swear to any of Norath&#39;s gods that I was moving<br/>
slower.  Singing Accelerado at that point made no difference, perhaps<br/>
because it now it the top space.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Anyway, on a related note, apparently you&#39;re not supposed to <br/>
&gt; be able to do<br/>
&gt; &gt;this, but in playing around we managed to stack SOW & <br/>
&gt; Accelerado.  The only<br/>
&gt; &gt;time we could get it to work though was when Accelerado went into the<br/>
&gt; second<br/>
&gt; &gt;space and SOW in the third.<br/>
