<div id="ygrps-yiv-577783513">Okay, yeah, that&#39;s what I finally figured out, hehe.. I thought of <br/>
one more reason why it doesn&#39;t work this way:<br/>
<br/>
If it did, they wouldn&#39;t have to add &quot;out of thin air&quot; the penalty <br/>
back in, they could just rework the equation to take off the <br/>
penalty.  Why have an equation like<br/>
<br/>
Bard_Exp_gained = Base_exp - 0.4*Base_exp + 0.4*Base_exp<br/>
<br/>
when they could just use<br/>
<br/>
Bard_Exp_gained = Base_exp <br/>
<br/>
to the same end result?  I can see no reason why this simple equation <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work.  Also, they went to great lengths to describe how <br/>
changing the experience tables would not work (i.e. it would give <br/>
every Hybrid an additional few levels) for there to not actually be <br/>
these experience tables.  They WOULD have had an easier time <br/>
implementing this change if it did work that way (and we probably <br/>
would have seen the change a lot sooner - I got the impression that <br/>
they would have done it sooner had they been able to figure out HOW).<br/>
<br/>
I understand where you&#39;re coming from, tho.  Back to the original <br/>
statement that was made, I don&#39;t think that guy was saying what <br/>
you&#39;re saying.  At least, he didn&#39;t respond to the posts saying, &quot;I <br/>
understand where you&#39;re coming from, but what if it works this <br/>
way...&quot;.  I, honestly, just think he didn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>
