<div id="ygrps-yiv-597096480">Wow... Is the shard really worth that much. A guild<br/>
mate gave me one last night when i asked him what it<br/>
did. (He had just /auctioned it).  He wanted my<br/>
dragoon dirk in trade which i gladly gave him.  I KNEW<br/>
he was giving me a VERY GOOD deal and thanked him<br/>
profusely, but i didnt reallize how good of deal.<br/>
<br/>
The goblins in high keep (all of them yellow and red)<br/>
keep resisting the proc.  I have successfully proced<br/>
like 3 times in 4 hours. Is there anything I can do to<br/>
help this. I moved it to my primary hand and put PGT<br/>
in 2nd after about half an hour with not even seeing<br/>
it try to proc. (gave claws away that i had been using<br/>
in primary) Stats are --- Piercing 120, Duel Wield<br/>
130, AGI 118, DEX 112, INT 80<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; How much was the shard, if I may ask?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I see them go for 1000p sometimes, but mabey that<br/>
&gt; is just<br/>
&gt; &gt; a fluke?<br/>
