<div id="ygrps-yiv-659123783">Strangely enough, I&#39;ve spent only one full day in Hate. I was the only bard<br/>
all day as I recall. I got the boots, BP and a Martune rapier. I&#39;ve only<br/>
been back once for just a few hours, it was mostly clean and we just went to<br/>
lend a hand to the crew finishing up after some folks had to camp. No bard<br/>
stuff dropped either time from the Maestro.<br/>
<br/>
Oh btw, I&#39;ve found wisps really really hate clerics. I haven&#39;t seen the like<br/>
since they turned down bard hate. Twice last night in WC my L10 cleric was<br/>
ganged by wisps. I started on one, another dove in when the first was mostly<br/>
dead, then it was about dead a third and then a fourth jumped in! I only saw<br/>
the one wisp when I started the fight. I had to run. Later, I started on<br/>
another one and in about 2 minutes, I had five live wisps chase me to the<br/>
zoneline after I killed the first one! Have you ever seen a wisp train? I<br/>
had zoned in and out between fights so there couldn&#39;t have been any leftover<br/>
aggro.<br/>
