 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want any new power for my bard, I just a few things fixed.<br/>
Snare was one.<br/>

Now how about the stop, start, stop spell bug which has managed to survive<br/>
for 2 years.  (This happens to all casters, bards just notice it the most<br/>
since we cast spells a  lot more than any other casters).<br/>
<br/>
How about making it so I don&#39;t sucessfully charm a mob, yet have no control<br/>
over him and am unable to recharm or attack the mob till charm breaks.<br/>
<br/>
And (and this will NEVER happen) some way to take the strain of twisting off<br/>
my poor fingers.<br/>
