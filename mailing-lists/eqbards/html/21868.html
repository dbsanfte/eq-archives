missing graphic, it was with a missing attach point.  The graphics were <br/>
already in the game - they just had to correct the model for male <br/>
barbarians (which, apparently, they thought would constitute too large a <br/>
download.)<br/>
<br/>
The Bardic Drum IS a significantly greater in complexity - first, they have <br/>
to create the item graphic (cf Nostrolo&#39;s), then make sure that there is a <br/>
corresponding graphic for the offhand (much more complex than it sounds) to <br/>
act as the stick.  Of course, they could just make it a bongo... but the <br/>
point is that the Bard Drum is a step in a different direction (something <br/>
in the &quot;off&quot; hand being utilized by the active hand...), and thus I can <br/>
understand the complexity issue.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, they&#39;re too stupid to figure it out.<br/>
