Thanks for your help on the quest.  I am in SK now and plan just to run over<br/>
to Queynos and take a trip to Erudin while I am not in Kunark.  Also, thanks<br/>
for sharing your kite areas.  I am just starting to do OT and find it works<br/>
pretty well there, too.<br/>
<br/>
So, my next question - just keeping the list active =).  I have some<br/>
Lambent(Helm, gauntlets and bracer) and plan to get the rest.  Yeah, varied<br/>
opinions on if it is the &quot;best&quot; armor for us, but I want to at least have<br/>
the look for a while.  My query is on options on my other armor - cloak,<br/>
rings, earrings, neck, face, etc.  I have a jagged band, a +7 Cha ring, a<br/>
splintered bronze cloak, 2 oppoline Cha earrings and some + Cha necklace,<br/>
Splitpaw maybe.  I have been lucky in FM and have used pp from my two loops<br/>
to purchase a MM drum (800) and currently have my remaining stash (1300ish)<br/>
burning a hole in my pocket.  I have most of the gems already for my<br/>
Lambent, so I don&#39;t need to spend for them.  My weapons are Obsidian Shard,<br/>
Pugius, Dragoon Dirk in range slot and I use Gnoll Hide whips to keep up 1HS<br/>
and use for stunning casters.  Lately, I have been using the shard in my<br/>
primary hand and the whip in my off hand - fun to burn and stun at the same<br/>
time - that&#39;s when I use weapons at all as my melee does not compare(as we<br/>
all know).  I really want to upgrade my cloak and maybe my neck, but if you<br/>
have other suggestions for my other slots, please share them with me(face<br/>
WILL be the mask one day).  Include your opinion of ball park value(I know<br/>
it varies server to server) and where I could find it if I just traveled<br/>
there(assuming I can camp there or maybe I can do it in my future) and any<br/>
stats you can remember.  Again, thanks in advance.<br/>
