<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928288739">I do not know why but it is true that the /assist command is very buggy.  I<br/>
get it to work like 1 out of 3 tries.  I did observed that the /assist<br/>
command is harder when it is used with a magic user while they are casting a<br/>
spell: paladin, SK, clerics.... <br/>

completely different mobs, and we don&#39;t know why.<br/>

Has anyone else had similar experiences?<br/>
