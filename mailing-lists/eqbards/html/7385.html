<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918396762">I play my bard on Prexus and am called Orchestro (Level 9).  I just wanted<br/>
to say something about a highly unforeseen effect the Bard class has had for<br/>
me, and for my play in game.  That effect being: 1) Money, and 2) Role<br/>
Playing Fun.<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain, I have played since the release of the game under various<br/>
guises, Druid, Ranger, Cleric, Necromancer, Enchanter, Paladin, Ive tried a<br/>
lot of em.  With all of the classes I have played where I didnt actively try<br/>
to role play a lot (Its damn difficult to roleplay a druid all the time, I<br/>
mean, people get sick of you after a while), I always found myself falling<br/>
into a rut.  After X amount of time, I would start to get bored, and find<br/>
myself looking for something new. <br/>
<br/>
Admittantly as I gradually migrated to trying more difficult classes my<br/>
skills became better, when finally I decided to try a Bard.  You know what I<br/>
have found? First and foremost it is the easiest class to role play.  I can<br/>
set up shop outside any town, in the tunnel to Ro, approach high level<br/>
characters with Lute and hand and automatically have two things:<br/>
<br/>
1) An opportunity to sing songs/ditties I have written, or read.<br/>
2) An avenue to approach high level character without them thinking: What<br/>
the hell<br/>
   does he want?<br/>
3) A great way to make money.<br/>
<br/>
I have made about 120P so far from singing alone.  Its amazing when you get<br/>
a gathering of people who are listening to your music and they start giving<br/>
you donations.   I have have low and high level people alike give me nice<br/>
donations (47P from one DE player is the record!), beause people like to be<br/>
given a chance to role play.  They want an avenue to take a break from the<br/>
hack and slash game.  The taverns are unused, there is no reason from a<br/>
player to go there, we are the key to keeping interest I think.<br/>
<br/>
I have been told that my songs entertain, that it was a great break, its<br/>
just a great feeling you get performing.  Although I was a bit dissapointed<br/>
when I had 2 GM&#39;s there listening and not 1 copper piece they donated :=)<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I am truly surprise by the fun and profit making I can have with<br/>
my Bard.<br/>
<br/>
Two changes I would like to see added would be:<br/>
<br/>
1) An addition to the Speech box (where you can click, Group, Say, Tell,<br/>
etc.) to include: Sing.  When clicked anything you typed would appear as:<br/>
<br/>
Orchestro sings, &quot;Hello my love,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Its *REALLY* annoying to have an emote line come back with the help line<br/>
because I typed in some character that negated it.<br/>
<br/>
:sings, Hello my love, two things I have:<br/>
might bomb it..<br/>
<br/>
2) A /play command.  I love being able to strum my lute, but I hate that I<br/>
have to play the healing song to do it.  I dont like people seeing &quot;You<br/>
wounds begin to heal&quot; when I am just trying to play my instrument.  It would<br/>
be nice to be able to do /play to instigate the playing animation, it would<br/>
also be REALLY nice to have the /play command actually start a song playing<br/>
on their speaker<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a few thoughts, I really like this class so far, I fondly<br/>
remember each and every performance that made my barbed whip purchase<br/>
possible, and it will always be special to me.<br/>
<br/>
If your a bard on Prexus, and generally play later in the night, ala<br/>
10:30-2AM CST, please drop me a note and maybe we can get together and put<br/>
on a mini concert somewhere.  I am currently in Freeport.<br/>

<br/>
P.S. If any bards here on Prexus have an old mistmoor drum for sale due to<br/>
an upgrade to selo&#39;s drum, please let me know.</div>
