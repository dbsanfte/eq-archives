&gt; While in Northern Freeport a friend of mine related an amazing discovery of<br/>
&gt; his to me.  it is possible to get up onto the Walls, running throughout North<br/>
&gt; Freeport :).  It is also possible to jump all gaps in the wall if you have<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s blasting and the drum on.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;     To get up there you have to Enter the Jade Tiger Inn, that is opposite<br/>
&gt; the Bank.  then you go up the stairs and enter the first room on the right,<br/>
&gt; and jump up on the balcony railing, then onto the wall :).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t have to worry about falling under the world up there, because there<br/>
&gt; is a zone border that stops you, although I would be careful....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Now, go off and confuse everyone by jumping on top of the bank, and running<br/>
&gt; along the walls :).<br/>

exploit.  (No, I will not divulge the nature of the exploit).  Consider<br/>
yerselves warned, you nosy curious explorer-types (wait.... that like,<br/>
perfectly defines Bards.... Go fig.)<br/>
