<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635363315">I soloed from level 1-5 in West Freeport and East Commons.<br/>
<br/>
From there on I NEVER soloed.  Personally I find EQ to be an AWFUL solo<br/>
game.  It&#39;s only the social aspect - and the interaction and strategy<br/>
between the player classes that I find interesting - ESPECIALLY for the<br/>
bard<br/>
class (where our strength is that we can fill in for so many other<br/>
classes).<br/>
<br/>
If I want to solo - I fire up Civ3 - it&#39;s a MUCH better single-player game.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that a lot of people will want to game for a 30-60 minute<br/>
session - and the difficulty of finding a group and getting setup precludes<br/>
that (especially if you are unguilded or in a small guild) - but again -<br/>
that&#39;s when I play some Civ3 (or whatever game it was in the past)...<br/>

Yup!  I that&#39;s another reason I spent two levels primarily in Unrest.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t too difficult to find a group.  And since I could solo very<br/>
effectively, the wait to get a group never bothered me.  Generally I&#39;d just<br/>
start soloing and when others saw me taking on multiple mobs at once with<br/>
negligible down time they&#39;d invite me.  Never had to shout.  :-)<br/>
