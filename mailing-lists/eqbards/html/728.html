<b>Subject:</b> Diety Question and a Warning <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108802285">For those quick browsers of messages, here is my warning.  I used the first<br/>
level attack song alternating it mainly with the level 2 buff song when fighting<br/>
in and around my home town of Kelethin.  Occasionally, when I run back to town<br/>
(NEVER still singing my attack song), a guard will kill me for no apparent<br/>
reason.  Maybe it thinks I attacked another PC if he or she happened to run by,<br/>
but I really don&#39;t know.  I fear that I have lost faction with my town, though I<br/>
receive no messages about it.  Shopkeepers now look at me apprehensively, except<br/>
for my guild of course.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, on to my question.  How much does a diety effect your actual abilities<br/>
and inter-race relations?  I play a Wood Elf bard, and have enjoyed it immensly,<br/>
but chose my diety as Tunare for fear of fraction problems.  I roleplay my<br/>
character as a romantic, so naturally Erolisi Marr (sp?) seems like a good<br/>
choice, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effects on others.  Would love to hear from<br/>
another bard who has tried more than one diety perhaps.<br/>

Laeaus, Wood Elf Bard level...(sigh)...3</div>
