<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065664354">OK. Let me start off by saying I too dislike twinking. That said, THE CHARACTER<br/>
IN QUESTION GOT THE ITEM WITHIN THE RULES OF THE GAME BY DOING A QUEST! How is<br/>
that a twink? He got the item fair and square so shouldn&#39;t it be his to do with<br/>
as he wishes?<br/>

&gt; I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players<br/>
&gt; because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our<br/>
&gt; behinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out<br/>
&gt; in part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford<br/>
&gt; buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that<br/>
&gt; until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces<br/>
&gt; (or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate<br/>
&gt; would I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I<br/>
&gt; play. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them -<br/>
&gt; sure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making the<br/>
&gt; most out of EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Twinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>
&gt; &gt;immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>
&gt; &gt;sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>
&gt; &gt;whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>
&gt; &gt;for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>
&gt; &gt;to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt;by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>
&gt; &gt;be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13. </span></blockquote></div>
