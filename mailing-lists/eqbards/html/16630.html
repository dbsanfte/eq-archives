treated as NPC saves against PC bash/slam.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 15. Song of Silence: good idea, but I could see Verant vetoing it<br/>
&gt; immediately. With a quick MR debuff from an enchanter, this song would make<br/>
&gt; casting mobs chumps. (a wiz with no songs, is easy prey, even if he is dual<br/>
&gt; wielding FS spears)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You mean kinda like root/snare/SoW makes melee mobs chumps?  <br/>
I don&#39;t see this song/spell as an option.  I see it as a<br/>
requirement if they want any semblance of balance between<br/>
casters and melee.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 16. Serious upgrade to healing: again, HELL YEAH<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would wait to see how much damage the ubermobs do against<br/>
appropriate level players before deciding.  When I was in my<br/>
teens, giants almost always hit for 100+.  Now that they&#39;re<br/>
green to me, they miss a lot and seem to average around 30-40<br/>
per hit.  Hymn + Niv&#39;s IMHO is about right for the L47-50<br/>
range.  A tad underpowered when solo, a tad overpowered when<br/>
grouped with 5-6.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 18. Group damage dispersion/distribution: very interesting, I like the fact<br/>
&gt; that it is a double edged sword. It will help spread the damage out, however<br/>
&gt; if someone is close to dying, then this could concievably kill them. serious<br/>
&gt; invsetigation would need to take place regarding PvP aviodance. (bard gets<br/>
&gt; pissed at wiz, fires this song up and jumps off the ramp to HHP in EK.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like this idea too, but from a playbalance standpoint, you<br/>
have to consider it with the cleric&#39;s AE heals (which are like<br/>
2.5x more efficient than their targeted heals if a full group<br/>
is damaged).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 20. Upgraded mez capabilities: I&#39;m not sure we need an upgrade, just fix<br/>
&gt; what we got.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, if I had any faith that they&#39;d actually read my post<br/>
(took, what, 3 weeks for them to respond to my Lullaby post?),<br/>
I&#39;d grind the numbers for Lullaby/Pixie Strike resist rates to<br/>
make bards X% as effective as enchanters at mezzing.  Last<br/>
night we had two bats several times.  I tried both Pixie<br/>
Striking one, or helping the others fight while letting the<br/>
second bat beat on me.  Basically there was no difference.  <br/>
The resist rate is so bad that my crowd control ability is as<br/>
effective as my damage infliction capability.<br/>
