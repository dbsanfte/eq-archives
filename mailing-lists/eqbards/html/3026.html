<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645399829">I still have stuff on MY wish list hehe.<br/>
<br/>
i personally like looks over stats so i wear a full set of rubicite (except<br/>
for the awful helm).  mithril breastplate is better chestpiece from solusek<br/>
B if you want stats (ac17 15AGI).  mithril bracers from sol B (ac4 wis5<br/>
str3) or serpentine bracers from the reanimated hand in lower guk (ac1 dex3<br/>
agi9) are also better for stats.<br/>
<br/>
i am using a silvery war axe and crystalline blade as weapons.  i have a<br/>
staff or writhing in the bank.  what i want is a couple short swords of the<br/>
ykesha (can duel wield dmg8 del24 casts 75dmg proc), which takes anywhere<br/>
from 8 to 12 level 45+ people to get off the ghoul lord in lower guk.<br/>
<br/>
the jewelry that can be made is very nice.  golden amber earrings (plus 3<br/>
STR each) golden opal amulet (9STA 6AGI) and silver ruby veil (4STR 4WIS).<br/>
i don&#39;t feel like spending the money yet, but a platinum ruby veil is 7STR<br/>
7WIS.  and a black pearl choker is i think 7DEX 7AGI but i like the stamina<br/>
boost on the opal amulet.  jagged bands from the ghost in unrest are nice<br/>
rings, still haven&#39;t found anything better.  dwarven work boots from the<br/>
same ghost would be a stat improvement but look like chainmail.<br/>
<br/>
since i hate head graphics, i wear a fine silk turbin that comes off the<br/>
Sand Giant Hatar in Oasis or North Ro.  i would like the crown of the<br/>
froglok king from lower guk though, no graphics and better stats.<br/>
<br/>
i still don&#39;t have a troll hide belt from upper guk but would love one or a<br/>
flowing black silk sash from lower guk (still wearing a purity belt LOL).<br/>
like i said still lots of stuff on my wish list too.  for a level 50 i don&#39;t<br/>
have anything real special, but i like my items and my appearance, and can<br/>
now go after some stuff I want without worrying about experience or<br/>
levelling, which is nice and a relief.  my str, dex, and agi are all over<br/>
100, and i get plenty of buffs from songs or group members (clerics, shaman,<br/>
etc).  i&#39;ve given a lot of better items that i can use to my friends, or to<br/>
my paladin sister Erisi ;)<br/>
<br/>
so from now on i will just go after stuff i want but don&#39;t have, just have<br/>
fun, and help others out.  gimme a tell if you need anything, if i am free<br/>
i&#39;ll come =)<br/>

&gt; Hail,<br/>
&gt; Someone said Shada made L50, congratz! I was going to ask the <br/>
&gt; Xegony L50 <br/>
&gt; bard some questions but he has gone to ground apparently. I <br/>
&gt; have not turned <br/>
&gt; him up on a who list all weekend. Perhaps Shada can tell us <br/>
&gt; what weapons and <br/>
&gt; armor to put on our wish lists. :)<br/>
