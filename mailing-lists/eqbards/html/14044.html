<div id="ygrps-yiv-683391964">this thread was so long it took me a week almost to start reading it.  i<br/>
knew this would come up if dragons were mentioned ;)<br/>
<br/>
we killed vox right after the most recent patch, and i will say my<br/>
experience is more like Rokenn than it is like Harm.  i died all the time in<br/>
my early dragon raids, but since going with resists i have yet to die, and<br/>
usually everyone in my group lives as well.  i can end up taking almost no<br/>
damage from the breath spell, or i can take a bubb.  i can have 1 bubb left<br/>
at the end of the fight or i can have 4 bubbs.  anyway the last time i<br/>
specifically thought of you, because after getting hit by the first breath<br/>
spell i specifically looked at my health, which like Rokenn moved only 1/8th<br/>
bubb or so.  and i am within melee range as i have DMF and basically ride on<br/>
her back so i get all my group in song range.  anyway, late post just<br/>
passing the info along.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; breath as over the weekend we did both Nag & Vox (other <br/>
&gt; guilds were sloted <br/>
&gt; &gt; to do them but they could not take em and yield them to my <br/>
&gt; guild).  And in <br/>
&gt; &gt; both runs I has taking as little as 1/8th a bubble from <br/>
&gt; dragon breaths.  My <br/>
&gt; &gt; FR/CR was 220+ in both cases.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I wasn&#39;t there, I can&#39;t say.  And I can&#39;t call you a liar.<br/>
&gt;   But it&#39;s my opinion that you are exaggerating quite a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve been next to a dragon three times, CR 222, FR 170 and<br/>
&gt;   I took 400, yes four-hundred, points of dmg regardless.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   And 1/8th of a bubble?  Rokken, come on man gimme a break.<br/>
&gt;   You cannot expect me to believe that. heh.  Your fish is getting<br/>
&gt;   a little too big.<br/>
