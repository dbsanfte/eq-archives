<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093039039"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From a pure experience/time perspective, it is always better<br/>
&gt; to have more people in your group.  This is especially true as<br/>
&gt; a bard since your party songs multiply every person&#39;s<br/>
&gt; effectiveness.  The only time I turn down adding more people<br/>
&gt; to a group is if they are known jerks, or if the spawn in the<br/>
&gt; area will not support the extra people (i.e. there is nothing<br/>
&gt; else nearby and we are already handling what&#39;s there with<br/>
&gt; ease).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If this was not the case, then I can only assume you felt the<br/>
&gt; group&#39;s increased effectiveness with two tanks would not<br/>
&gt; offset the decrease in experience.  I&#39;d suggest you improve<br/>
&gt; your mixed tank/caster strategies then - the only remaining<br/>
&gt; factor is poor tactics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not have a steady group.  This was a pickup group, as all of mine are.<br/>
This is very frustrating at times because I am forever explaining group<br/>
tactics with a bard present to groups at my level (20th) that are unfamiliar<br/>
with bards.  &quot;Oh you heal?  Kewl!&quot;   Sigh...<br/>
<br/>
We turned down the warriors after discussion for several reasons.  We were<br/>
fading - it was 4:45am or so and we knew that we weren&#39;t going to be there<br/>
much longer.  In fact it was my opinion that changing tactics at that point,<br/>
with us as tired as we were, could have spelled disaster.  I discouraged their<br/>
joining.  We felt like we could continue to hold the room and we did.  One or<br/>
two hours earlier and I would have accepted their request.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I thought Anthem no longer stacked with Guardian Rhythms?  Or<br/>
&gt; maybe it was Chant of Battle that didn&#39;t stack with GR...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am quite sure...  I was weaving Anthem, Guardian and Elemental Rythms.  I<br/>
definitely verified that Guardian and Elemental stacked because I tested MR<br/>
with and without my drum playing one, the other and both.  I did not check<br/>
stats will all three stacked together, perhaps the icon displayed without<br/>
yielding any results (which I would find kinda disturbing).  Purifying and<br/>
Guardian Rythms do not stack as I recall.  Don&#39;t know about Chant of Battle as<br/>
I haven&#39;t played that in a while (probably should dust it off and try it at<br/>
20th though).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s tough to appraise the effectiveness of MR against casting<br/>
&gt; mobs because you don&#39;t get a message saying how much damage<br/>
&gt; their spells did.  The strategy I found worked best when I was<br/>
&gt; in Permafrost was just to play Lullaby over and over (stop and<br/>
&gt; restart it each time it pulses to minimize the interval).<br/>
&gt; That interrupted almost every spell, and the goblins went down<br/>
&gt; usually getting only 0 or 1 spell off, sometimes 2.  I dunno<br/>
&gt; how viable this strategy is at level 19 though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hadn&#39;t thought about stopping and restarting Lullaby to decrease the<br/>
interval.  That&#39;s for the tidbit.  In fact, I&#39;d been unsure as to how lullaby<br/>
worked and was hesitant to stop it at all.  If it&#39;s a pure &quot;tick song&quot; then<br/>
I&#39;ll definitely start weaving other songs with it.<br/>
<br/>
The only evidence I have of additional MR being a Good Thing is that we fought<br/>
the Preacher twice and had a couple of fights with both a Diviner and Evoker -<br/>
when I used the drum and boosted our MR, I was always surprised at how high<br/>
everyone&#39;s health was at the end of a battle.  Now with two wizards in the<br/>
fights they didn&#39;t last long, but when I played my &quot;melee songs&quot; in a similar<br/>
fight, the Cleric in our group would be healing away...  Very subjective stuff<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Set up a hotkey bank with four songs, your instrument melee<br/>
&gt; slot, and an instrument inventory slot.  Put the drum in the<br/>
&gt; melee slot and pick up the lute with your mouse cursor.  Play<br/>
&gt; ER, then GR.  When you switch to Hymn, click on the drum to<br/>
&gt; equip the lute and place the drum on the mouse cursor.  When<br/>
&gt; you switch back to ER, click on the lute to equip the drum<br/>
&gt; again.  (The instrument inventory slot isn&#39;t really necessary,<br/>
&gt; but I found it handy in case I needed to drop my rather<br/>
&gt; valuable Mistmoore drum to pick up something else.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This also works with Hymn (lute), CoD (lute), and DDD (horn).<br/>
&gt; Each song gets enhanced by its respective instrument, and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not that much more difficult to do.  It&#39;s still a hassle<br/>
&gt; though and I only set it up occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read about switching instruments and weapons in combat.  I have one<br/>
problem with that.  I currently have about 800pp worth of weapons (Thulian<br/>
Claw, Barbed Whip, Dragoon Dirk).  If I drop one of those, I stand a decent<br/>
chance of losing it permanently.  If I purchase a MM drum for somewhere around<br/>
400pp that brings me to 1,200pp worth of stuff I&#39;d be (literally) juggling.<br/>
Not my idea of a good time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you were doing most of the tanking, then Warsong probably<br/>
&gt; was appropriate.  If the others are taking damage though, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; consider using GR instead of Warsong.  It has a slight AC buff<br/>
&gt; (bigger than ER or PR) which is mostly negligible, but can<br/>
&gt; make a difference in marginal situations.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good observation.  I will play with GR and break out Chant and play with it<br/>
some too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When you are the lowest level member of a group, you should<br/>
&gt; concentrate more on party buff songs (which can&#39;t be resisted)<br/>
&gt; rather than offensive songs (which can be resisted).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which, although not fully formed in my mind perhaps, is what I was doing with<br/>
the exception of Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m curious if you found any basis for the claim that Lullaby<br/>
&gt; nixes the hate list.  Whenever I&#39;m grouped with overzealous<br/>
&gt; nukers, I haven&#39;t been able to use Lullaby to pull a mob off<br/>
&gt; them.  It goes to sleep, but when it wakes up it just resumes<br/>
&gt; chasing the nuker.  Finally after about 5 or 6 pulses of<br/>
&gt; Lullaby it starts to attack me, but then the caster nukes<br/>
&gt; again and the whole thing starts all over.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I didn&#39;t find that it nixed the shit list.  I found that the mobs<br/>
continued to attack the caster that they were glommed onto and that Lullaby<br/>
would not break them off, even after several rounds.  What it did seem to do<br/>
was provide the casters with time to cast without interruption, which is what<br/>
I was intending.  So even though the caster might have a Gob in his face, he<br/>
could cast on it.  It would awaken, pound my caster one time and then<br/>
(usually) nod off.  Caster casts again...  Repeat.  Of course the mobs that<br/>
weren&#39;t engaged by caster damage were pretty upset with me.  But generally<br/>
speaking I could keep them nodded enough that things worked out alright.<br/>
Occassionally I&#39;d need a heal &#39;cause at 19th getting hit even once in a while<br/>
for 40-50 pts is pretty rough.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bleh - a non-twinked L20 bard has better weapons than I do.<br/>
&gt; I need to get better weapons.  Doesn&#39;t help that my friends<br/>
&gt; and I aren&#39;t into camping...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I despise camping.  It&#39;s the main reason that I don&#39;t have a steady group.  I<br/>
get very restless very fast.  That&#39;s yet another reason I started a bard -<br/>
like a lot of the others on this list I like to travel around.<br/>
