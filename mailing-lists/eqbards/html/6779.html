You have to go inside the actual keep to find the bard selling songs.  He is<br/>
not outside in the zone where the orcs and gnolls hang out.  The entrance to<br/>
the keep is about halfway through the zone along the north wall.  If you<br/>
enter from Kithicor, follow the path straight until you come to the first<br/>
bridge.  There should be two paths that lead off to the right you can take.<br/>
Take the one that is on the left.  The one on the right leads to a shop.<br/>
Once you are on the correct path, never take a left turn.  There is a cave<br/>
on the left that contains three bandit NPCs who will attack you.  You want<br/>
to keep taking the path that leads to the right.  The entrance to the keep<br/>
has several guards standing in front of it.  Zone into the keep.  There is<br/>
an open area where several NPCs, including the bard mail quest NPC, are<br/>
standing around.  Go through this area.  The room the bard is in is one of<br/>
the first rooms on the left side of the keep past the open area.  I can&#39;t<br/>
tell you the actual path you take to get to him but that should get you in<br/>
the general vicinity.  If you find yourself at the bank you have gone too<br/>
far.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, you can get bound as soon as you zone into Highpass in case you are<br/>
worried about getting lost and running into any orcs or gnolls.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
