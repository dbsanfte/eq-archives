<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487638064"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Fair enough, but what about if you&#39;re playing one song on some instrument &<br/>
&gt;singing the lyrics and then add a line a two from another song that happens<br/>
&gt;to be in the same key? (If you&#39;re old enough to recall Live Aid, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;referring to what U2 did singing Ruby Tuesday over Bad)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also, for more recent variants of this, if yer a comedy fan, and watch<br/>
whoppie in sister Act 2, she does something similar. Alternating between<br/>
about 5 different songs, just singing them all to one beat, that merges em<br/>
rather nicely.</div>
