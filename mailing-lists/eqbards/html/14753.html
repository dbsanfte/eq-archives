Trust me, its not just Xegony- I was thinking the same thing on Bertoxx. I<br/>
have never been harassed as much as I have in the last couple of months. I<br/>
don&#39;t mind answering questions- that I will always do, but I have never<br/>
asked someone to give me money or equipment for no reason- that constitutes<br/>
whining :)-and i just hit &quot;ignore&quot;. Sad, really, because I love to surprise<br/>
newbies by giving them some money or an item -I especially like the little<br/>
guys who buff me and ask for nothing- I realize they are practising, but<br/>
when they ask for or expect nothing in return, that&#39;s when being a nice guy<br/>
kinda makes you feel good- but now I try to avoid the big  cities.<br/>

&gt;    I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s given the &quot;age&quot; and popularity of the Xegony<br/>
&gt;server; or perhaps the influx of XMas newbies with no understanding of the<br/>
&gt;dynamics of the game; but it seems like the past couple months I seem to<br/>
&gt;constantly get begs from new characters for me to give them stuff.<br/>
