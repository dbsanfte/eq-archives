<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265559147">And when Verant stops providing the servers for us, we officially are SOL.<br/>
In fact, this should really be investigated, since whenever the servers are<br/>
down (or in a really bad way like last night), we are unable to use our<br/>
paid-for service.  Server emulators provide us a means to access our<br/>
paid-for game when Verant cannot or will not.  Otherwise, we are paying $50<br/>
+ 10/month for coasters.  This is rather like purchasing a car and being<br/>
told that you can only drive it on highways - never locally.<br/>
Other people are building emulators as we speak (if for nothing more than<br/>
the challenge of it), and I&#39;m sure that there are even hack-programs being<br/>
written to allow people to alt-tab, etc.  Verant will be hard-pressed to<br/>
stop all of it, and to be honest, considering some of their recent<br/>
attitudes toward customers, I have little sympathy.  (cf. Ak&#39;anon Alliance<br/>
scandal, secret &#39;nerfing&#39;, failure to reimburse for bugs THEY caused.)   I<br/>
lost a shiny brass shield last night, due to a bug, the ONE &quot;neato&quot; thing I<br/>
*WORKED* for (I fought that trainer, and fought and fought until I got the<br/>
shield), only to lose it to a bug.  FYI, never drop a LORE item inside of a<br/>
backpack onto the ground.  It goes bye-bye.  I didn&#39;t even bother<br/>
petitioning it - just logged the bug, then went back to dying in Everfrost<br/>
(which also annoys me - 5 hours spent looking for the elusive Karg Icebear,<br/>
only to find out he only spawns once a day, and then is immediately killed<br/>
by GZ hunters.)<br/>
