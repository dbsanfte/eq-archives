<div id="ygrps-yiv-51314265">Just to clarify.  You do not have to have a target in range when practicing<br/>
Brass Instruments using Disruptive Discord.  You dont get the animation, but<br/>
you are still playing the instrument.  I have brought my Brass Skill to 110<br/>
playing my horn for hours, high on a remote wall inside East Karana.  The<br/>
skill goes up very slowly, but it does go up.<br/>
