<b>Subject:</b> Cazic Thule Exploits (was bard vs enchanter) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-82687112">I&#39;m the one who started this thread when I told my story about using Lullaby<br/>
to put 10 mobs to sleep while my group was fighting on the steps at the top<br/>
of the pyramid.  In short, when my party got to the top of the temple<br/>
(invis), there was a full spawn of mobs waiting for us.  For the duration of<br/>
the fight, I stayed at the bottom of the steps playing Lullaby while the<br/>
tanks and the other bard were on the steps meleeing the mobs.  Even though I<br/>
was playing Lullaby non-stop, I rarely got attacked during the duration of<br/>
the battle.  However, the three people on the steps did.  The other bard,<br/>
who was weaving anthem, lullaby and hymn, was the only person who got beat<br/>
up really bad.  <br/>
<br/>
After reading all the posts about the Cazic exploit, I&#39;m trying to figure<br/>
out if the reason I didn&#39;t take any damage was because either 1) I was<br/>
unknowingly using an exploit (I wasn&#39;t on the steps and as a result could<br/>
not get attacked) or 2) the mobs didn&#39;t attack me because there was a lower<br/>
level bard also pissing them off with Lullaby and hymn.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok, Cazic-Thule spoiler time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is not a spoiler... This is an Exploit.  If caught, you will get<br/>
&gt; banned.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been fighting at the top and the bottom of the temple for about 2<br/>
&gt; months now.  If you engage a mob and run to the bottom, the mob will<br/>
&gt; eventually follow you all the way down and you can fight it without<br/>
&gt; exploiting.  The frustrating part is when a small group ( 1 or 2) will sit<br/>
&gt; in the temple halls, steal the pulls, and exploit the mob.  (In many cases<br/>
&gt; this is a level 50 and a level 25 or so, get the hint?)  I normally let<br/>
&gt; people play however they want to play, as long as it doesn&#39;t effect me, no<br/>
&gt; matter how cheesy and lame the tactics may be.  However, when I head back<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; the temple to find what happened to the Archon I pulled and find someone<br/>
&gt; exploiting in this manner (Numerous other mobs as well), I am forced to<br/>
&gt; /petition.  It was funny to hear from the guide that these players claimed<br/>
&gt; to not know they are exploiting.  How can anyone kill anything without<br/>
&gt; risk<br/>
&gt; to themselves like this and think it is a fair tactic?  And when you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; ruining the fun of another group who is playing fair, at that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To combat this, I&#39;ve started to use charm to pull when the temple holds<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; groups than mine.  (Just to keep this thread on topic :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>
&gt; Xegony<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Archon Temple is very buggy pathwise.  There are two primary ways in<br/>
&gt; &gt; which groups exploit this:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) A puller is SoWed and (with or without levitation) runs down the<br/>
&gt; tiers<br/>
&gt; &gt; and away from the Archon&#39;s steps to pull.  He punches a lizard in the<br/>
&gt; nose<br/>
&gt; &gt; and runs back to the group at the base of the steps.  Generally speaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; that lizard hasn&#39;t followed him back, it is somewhere away from the<br/>
&gt; Archon<br/>
&gt; &gt; steps, aggrod and &quot;frozen&quot;.  Quite often groups will curse the bad<br/>
&gt; pathing<br/>
&gt; &gt; and run to the lizard to defeat it (nothing wrong with that).  However,<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; the puller stands *on the steps* themselves at the Archon Temple top,<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lizard will unfreeze and run to the puller at the steps.  To be<br/>
&gt; perfectly<br/>
&gt; &gt; clear: You MUST stand upon the steps for the mobs to come to you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Therefore, the puller&#39;s presence on the steps becomes something of an<br/>
&gt; on/off<br/>
&gt; &gt; switch for mob activity and movement.  The exploit part of this occurs<br/>
&gt; once<br/>
&gt; &gt; these lizards have come to the puller at the steps.  If the puller to<br/>
&gt; whom<br/>
&gt; &gt; the lizards are aggrod removes himself from the steps they will once<br/>
&gt; again<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;freeze&quot; due to the pathing bug.  The group can now fire at will with<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; chance of the lizards leaving the steps to actively engaging them in<br/>
&gt; melee.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other melee members of the party can sometimes melee the lizard on the<br/>
&gt; steps<br/>
&gt; &gt; in safety - it&#39;s as though the hate list of these buggy lizards doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; reorganize itself.  Regardless of the damage others do to them, the<br/>
&gt; lizards<br/>
&gt; &gt; remain aggrod on the first guy that bonked them on the head.  If the<br/>
&gt; lizards<br/>
&gt; &gt; *do* engage in melee, the entire party can move away from the steps to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first 90 degree corner (either seems to work) and the lizards have<br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; &gt; very good chance of freezing when the party reaches the corner.  A group<br/>
&gt; &gt; that knows how to work the pathing of the lizards up there can have a<br/>
&gt; *very*<br/>
&gt; &gt; safe time of taking out lizzies.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have been in groups that had the puller deliberately go out and smack<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; many lizzies as possible to create a 12 liz train to the Archon.  Once<br/>
&gt; &gt; there, the puller stands on the steps and takes a bit of abuse while all<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lizards catch up.  Then the puller does his best to arrange the lizards<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; as closely knit a group as possible on the steps, then jumps from the<br/>
&gt; steps<br/>
&gt; &gt; freezing them all in place.  Wizards and Mages then AE the whole bundle<br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; at their leisure.  I quickly departed these groups because this is<br/>
&gt; BORING<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; hell, and actually not any faster (I&#39;d argue slower) than a good<br/>
&gt; &gt; old-fashioned fight or three.  The only reason I was invited was as a<br/>
&gt; mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; pump for the casters.  Basically I was to stand around watching and<br/>
&gt; playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; Clarity continuously.  Forget it - the Throne Room is more fun and<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; &gt; potential loot in that case.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) Mobs that are aggrod to a party cannot reach the actual flat top of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; temple.  If (when) trains of lizards occur, simply run up the sloped<br/>
&gt; walls<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the Archon&#39;s Temple and you will be both out of melee range and out<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell range.  The mobs will remain aggrod on you, but will mill around<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Archon steps.  Casters can cast on the lizards from here in relative<br/>
&gt; &gt; safety (this is an confirmed exploit by Verant, you can get BANNED if<br/>
&gt; caught<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing this).  Large races will either need a levitation (maybe a shrink<br/>
&gt; &gt; would work too) or old Guise of the Deceiver in order for them to reach<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; top.  If the situation with the lizards gets unmanageable, simply camp<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; up here and come back to clear their aggro lists.  All members of your<br/>
&gt; party<br/>
&gt; &gt; must camp for this to work.  I have camped overnight on the top here<br/>
&gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; times.  Lizards simply cannot get up here, and the two or three times<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen it they 32k (suicide) themselves.  I have *never* heard that<br/>
&gt; &gt; running to the top to escape lizards is an exploit, only that casting<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; here is.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Use your knowledge wisely.<br/>
