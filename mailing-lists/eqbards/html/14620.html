&gt; Abashi responded to a similar question today. In a nutshell, if you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t play 12 hours a day, the high end stuff isnt for you, and that&#39;s<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Hell I play 6 hours a night, and spent well over 16 hours in planes<br/>
  this last weekend, what did I get to show for it?  One bubble of<br/>
  experience lost and a lot of cursing.  I still don&#39;t have the elite<br/>
  goods that I&#39;d like to have, and look at how much I play. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  Then again I don&#39;t play as much as Sylly.<br/>
<br/>
  5:00pm       /who sylly<br/>
  12:00pm      /who sylly<br/>
  2:00am       /who sylly<br/>
  5:00am???!!? /who sylly<br/>

  Must be a really cozy job.  Or you &#39;fell asleep&#39; again.<br/>
