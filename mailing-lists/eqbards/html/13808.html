<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115318747">LOL.  Worry not Golias, I never take things here personally, well okay there<br/>
is one exception I won&#39;t specify but that was way out there.  The hate mail<br/>
they get is a big part of the problem, exacerbated by the clientele they<br/>
have.  Most of the people on this board are educated, civil, and reasonable.<br/>
Unfortunately, for every one of us there are 50 teenagers or even non-teens<br/>
who just want to spew their hate wherever they find a shot.  They&#39;d be far<br/>
better off to just ignore the hateful posts and never, ever reply to them.<br/>
If they only replied to or addressed the reasonably polite posts I think<br/>
they&#39;d see a change.<br/>
<br/>
I do wonder how many &#39;false&#39; complaints they get.  If you remember my<br/>
experience with the GM on E&#39;ci who literally accused me of writing a program<br/>
to allow windows debugger to crash EQ when I was about to die, you&#39;d know<br/>
their policy is to treat all complaints as false unless patently proved<br/>
otherwise.  I even had a page fault screenshot to send in, which I did, and<br/>
they still refused to help me in any way.  It was pretty sad.  In Verant&#39;s<br/>
eyes the customer is not only always wrong, he&#39;s a lying cheat who will do<br/>
anything to gain any advantage over the game.  Starting off with that as<br/>
your basic customer service assumption is not particularly comforting, but<br/>
is nearly word for word what the GM told me their position was.<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;ll get more thanks when we see how they implement the change to<br/>
bard taunt and how it works.  I think at this point most people fear it will<br/>
be like the three new spells they gave us that could only be cast on<br/>
ourselves, yet were DoT&#39;s.  They&#39;ve built up a lot of skepticism in me and<br/>
many other bards that they even know how to make a change to us that works.<br/>
Hopefully Galtin is right and things are changing for the better.  Warrior&#39;s<br/>
have gotten a new offensive skill, who knows maybe we will get another<br/>
defensive skill.  I can but dream.<br/>

I agree with you that they can get pretty touchy, but look at the outright<br/>
hatred they get on the boards.  They addressed Bard Taunt and got a barely<br/>
audible murmur of approval or thanks.  They change an animation which is a<br/>
trivial thing, and get 5 new hate threads on how they suck in the EQ boards.<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, but how many zillions of false complaints do you think they<br/>
get<br/>
every day, like the Necro Pet Stealth Nerf that never happened.<br/>
<br/>
Sure they could be better, but I&#39;d have gone berserk by now :)<br/>
<br/>
Golias, who promised to leave this thread....I suck<br/>
