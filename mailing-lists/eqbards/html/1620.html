<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019994235">I have the same card and have had horrendous trouble getting booted.  I<br/>
installed the detonator drivers and opened my case and directed a desk fan<br/>
straight at the card (which was hot), and my problem has mostly gone<br/>
away.... Still the occasional crash, tho.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the non-bard thread.  : P<br/>

&gt;installed the Nvidia Detonator drivers at the recommendation of Verant Tech<br/>
&gt;Support (thats right, they actually responded to my email).  I have had no<br/>
&gt;problems with lockups since I installed the Detonator drivers.  If you have<br/>
&gt;a RIVA TNT card you may want to look into that as a solution to your<br/>
