&gt; &gt; - Singing the song at an NPC who &quot;scowls at you ready to attack&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tried it on a Nektulos Guard (Dark Elf lands) and changed him from<br/>
&gt; &quot;scowls and ready to attack&quot; to &quot;looks at me threateningly&quot;... he<br/>
&gt; still chased me out of their forest as I got a bit too close while<br/>
&gt; trying to charm him :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  I used it on a gargoyle, and he went from &quot;Scowls at you ready<br/>
to attack&quot; to &quot;beating the crap out of me&quot;. :)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it was the song that caused it though, and I&#39;m pretty sure the<br/>
song had no effect before he saw me.<br/>
