<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762976111">A copy of my post to Usenet, to bring you all up to date and to let<br/>
you know that my singing voice has returned and I can return to the<br/>
singing, smiling, dancing, playing bard that I used to be ;-)<br/>
<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may remember my post earlier this week about the loss of<br/>
all my valuable items and equipment due to what appeared to be some<br/>
unauthorised access to my EQ account.  For those that missed the<br/>
message, I&#39;ve attached it below.<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased to be able to report back to you all the results of my<br/>
discussions with the senior GM administrator for the server and the<br/>
outcome for me personally.<br/>
<br/>
It took a few days, a couple of emails and some patience before I got<br/>
to speak to the GM in person on Friday night (curse me for living in<br/>
England, it seems, and needing to go to bed at a reasonable time<br/>
during the week!)  However, my conversation with the GM was polite,<br/>
courteous and friendly.<br/>
<br/>
The outcome was that my characters were restored to the last backup,<br/>
my items and money have now broadly been restored to me and I feel<br/>
significantly happier in myself and about Verant as a whole than I did<br/>
at the start of the week.<br/>
<br/>
One negative side effect was that I lost the level I gained during<br/>
Sunday, but that can be more easily recovered.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it appears that Verant are unable to trace the person<br/>
who gained access to my account and so no action can be taken against<br/>
them.  If anything useful has come out of this, I hope it will be that<br/>
the security logs in place at the station/Verant/wherever can be<br/>
altered so that an IP address, or the CD key is recorded and therefore<br/>
an individual account access can be properly traced to the owner.<br/>
<br/>
I still have no firm idea of how the access could have happened.<br/>
There is a possibility that my character screen was simply presented<br/>
to another use in one of those rare hiccups that computers have<br/>
&lt;cough&gt; but whether this is repeatable I don&#39;t know.  I haven&#39;t looked<br/>
around the station much to see if you can obtain a list of user<br/>
identities and then try to guess/brute force the password.  But at<br/>
this stage, I have changed my password so it is no longer a dictionary<br/>
word, and I will shortly find a way to change my station ID.<br/>
<br/>
So, to me this is a very happy ending to a long week in EQ.  I would<br/>
like to publically thank Brother Xave on Mithaniel Marr for his<br/>
assistance and help in resolving this matter.  I would also like to<br/>
express my deepest thanks to the people who emailed me, and especially<br/>
those in the game, who offered me (a total stranger) support and money<br/>
to help me out without any thoughts of a guaranteed recovery.  Some of<br/>
my lost faith in humanity has been restored.  To those that I was able<br/>
to accept your offer, I am now in a position to more than return the<br/>
value you gave me, and to offer a similar kindness should this happen<br/>
to you.<br/>

&gt;The story begins ....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sunday night, after a reasonably successful day my wizard returns to<br/>
&gt;Freeport, does her bits and pieces in the city and then returns to the<br/>
&gt;West gate to camp for the night.  Roughly 8pm my time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sometime earlier, my bard has already had a look out, and has camped<br/>
&gt;at about the same spot in West Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Monday night .... after a day at work, I return home to log in and<br/>
&gt;take out my frustrations on the orcs, goblins and other meanies of<br/>
&gt;Norrath.  I get to the character screen and decide to take the bard<br/>
&gt;out for a run.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Strange.  The character model is naked except for the lute.  Oh well,<br/>
&gt;maybe it got corrupted somehow, so I select enter world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Strange.  I&#39;m standing at the counter in the Freeport bank.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;park here the last time.  Press inventory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even stranger.  Where have all my armour and weapons gone?  &lt;insert<br/>
&gt;growing concern&gt;  Check the bank manager.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh dear.  &lt;insert sinking feeling&gt;  Where has all my money gone?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Immediately camp.  Check my other characters on the screen.  Wizard is<br/>
&gt;also naked.  Other 2 throwaway characters seem to be untouched.  So I<br/>
&gt;enter the world as my wizard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Same routine ... I don&#39;t remember camping at the same counter in the<br/>
&gt;Freeport bank.  Oh look, armour and equipment seems to have<br/>
&gt;disappeared.  And yes, so has all my money in the bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;insert a thump as I can&#39;t sink any lower&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And then I get to thinking.  Well, no one else has physical access to<br/>
&gt;my computer, let alone knowledge of my station ID or password.  My CD<br/>
&gt;is safely locked away, the account key long since forgotten or known<br/>
&gt;outside of this room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I certainly did not give away the equipment and money.  And especially<br/>
&gt;not on both my main characters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think for a while and can&#39;t come up with any other reasonable<br/>
&gt;explanation ....my account has been accessed without my knowledge or<br/>
&gt;consent, and all my bits and pieces have been &quot;donated&quot; away to<br/>
&gt;persons unknown.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At this stage, I phone Verant (or whoever).  Spend a good half hour in<br/>
&gt;a queue on the customer support only to be told I should have phoned<br/>
&gt;tech support. &lt;sigh - at least it&#39;s the same the world over&gt;  Phone<br/>
&gt;tech support .... I should petition and speak to the GM on the server.<br/>
&gt;Yes I already did the petition thing, no one was on.  So I was<br/>
&gt;provided with the Mith Marr administrator&#39;s email address, and<br/>
&gt;promptly sent an email off to him/her.  I also logged in, went round<br/>
&gt;killing the lowest of the low beasts in an attempt to recover some<br/>
&gt;money, and then eventually sat in W Freeport and waited.  But it is<br/>
&gt;time for me to log, and I shall have to seek a solution via email.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is simply an information sharing posting, to warn people that it<br/>
&gt;is possible for such things to happen.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, my<br/>
&gt;account was compromised, I can see no other explanation for it.  My<br/>
&gt;only hope is that the logs retained by the administrators will<br/>
&gt;demonstrate the time my account was accessed, the IP address used, and<br/>
&gt;hopefully the EQ account key used.  This will at least provide a trace<br/>
&gt;to the person responsible and &lt;fingers crossed&gt; remove them from the<br/>
&gt;game.  If I have lost my money and equipment, so be it, my life still<br/>
&gt;continues, perhaps somewhat disappointed, and certainly demotivated<br/>
&gt;for tonight at least.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would welcome any other reasonable suggestions that could explain<br/>
&gt;what has happened.  People lose equpiment and money to bugs quite a<br/>
&gt;bit, however having both characters standing at the counter in the<br/>
&gt;Freeport bank cannot be explained by a bug.  I am simply at a loss to<br/>
&gt;explain it in any other way than an unauthorised account use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, throwing it open to the rather more well-informed crowd ......<br/>
