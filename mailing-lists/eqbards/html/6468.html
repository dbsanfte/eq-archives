<b>Subject:</b> RE: Mino horn graphic bugged after patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-489609257"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; as if it wasn&#39;t bad enough that my drum looks like a <br/>
&gt; stick.  Now,<br/>
&gt; after yesterdays patch, equipping a mino horn makes it look <br/>
&gt; like I&#39;ve got a<br/>
&gt; small burlap sack attached to my wrist.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Strange, I noticed that too...but the mino horn didn&#39;t used to have a<br/>
graphic at all on the Avatar screen.  Maybe they meant to use the graphic<br/>
for the brass horn or something...the wonderful brass horn that we blow into<br/>
the wrong end of.<br/>
<br/>
The burlap sack graphic startled me and looks even more weird than the<br/>
backward brass horn.<br/>
<br/>
I have an Order of Thunder Medallion that I got from the Qeynos sewers<br/>
months ago that I have kept because it had +5CHA +2AC and acts as a<br/>
lightstone (lesser).  The graphic for that was changed with the patch and<br/>
looks much cooler, but when I inspected it the 2 AC points had been nerfed.<br/>
This is a LORE, NO DROP, NO TRADE. +5 amulet now - grrrrr, I can&#39;t even put<br/>
it in the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Enough ranting...those that got nailed on the box of Abu-Kar are much worse<br/>
off considering the investment they made on it.  I wonder if this was a ploy<br/>
to get all the people in the game with too much coin to blow it on the box<br/>
only to have it devalued and then resold to the poor people in the game at a<br/>
loss to help &quot;balance&quot; the economy?  Nahhhh, sounds like I am heading down<br/>
conspiracy theory lane and will soon be seeing black helicopters on the<br/>
horizon.<br/>
