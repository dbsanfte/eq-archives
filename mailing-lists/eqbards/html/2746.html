<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781519113">I&#39;ve been working to create an interactive online database that would be<br/>
helpful to find our fellow EQ&#39;ers.  It&#39;s up and running, and the response<br/>
has been amazing!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s called the &quot;Members Registry&quot;. (We&#39;re a Bard Specific Site, but I was<br/>
requested by quite a few people to open it up to all character classes) =)<br/>
<br/>
Submiting character information is as simple as an online form.  Once you<br/>
click submit, the information is automatically processed and added to the<br/>
database.  No emails to send, no people who have to post it, and thus..no<br/>
delays, mistakes, or lost messages. <br/>
<br/>
Its NS and IE friendly, requires no plugins or downloads, and loads very<br/>
quickly.  (though since we&#39;ve got upwards of 360 people already registered<br/>
within the last week, it does take a few seconds to load now)  The<br/>
interface is very user-friendly, and has lots of options, including Sort,<br/>
Search and Filter by any Category (Such as Character Name, Server, Level,<br/>
etc), as well as email and url click and open support.<br/>
<br/>
The database has been SO well received, that I&#39;ve decided create additional<br/>
databases to include other areas as well.  For example, by the end of the<br/>
week, the Guild Database will be online, and others will follow.  Keep<br/>
checking back, you&#39;ll find some new and helpful things happening over at<br/>
the EQ Bardic Guide in the next month.  <br/>
<br/>
And if you have any suggestions, lets here them.  (My main question would<br/>
be, what kind of databases would be most useful to you all?  Would pictures<br/>
be helpful to include?)  The more input I get on what YOU all want, the<br/>
better it will be for all of us! =)<br/>
