<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-44042986">Funny thing... I met what I considered to be an Ebay druid the other<br/>
night on The Rathe.  &quot;Golrian&quot; (No, I&#39;m not shy about naming names ;p ) was<br/>
a level 25 druid who I had the misfortune to meet when he logged on at the<br/>
hermit&#39;s hut in SK.  Not only did he KITE the hermit at lvl 25, but wasited<br/>
all of his mana each time.  Once he realized that I and my wizzie friend<br/>
wanted to rotate kills, he got quite impatient (even though he couldn&#39;t get<br/>
his mana back up in time for the next spawn) and left.  During the night he<br/>
continually asked me if we were done hunting the hermit yet.<br/>
    Just when I thought he was going to aggrivate me into sending him off<br/>
&quot;to the Hall of the Mountain Giants&quot; (rofl!), he REALLY showed his newbness<br/>
with the /ooc question &quot;What is topaz?&quot;  To top it off, the very next night<br/>
a friend of mine was in the same zone as this more-dollars-than-sense idiot<br/>
when he /shout&#39;d &quot;I want to buy druid stuff and have 4,000 platinum.&quot;<br/>
    Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I don&#39;t want someone operating on me whose<br/>
maxximum medical experience is to have watched somoen play Operation (insert<br/>
lil tm logo here :p )<br/>
    Back in the days of NWN (no, not that crap that Bioware is putting out,<br/>
the REAL NWN that was on AOheLl), someone like that would have been lured<br/>
out to the Lost Hills (a pvp zone) and mercilessly killed over and over.  If<br/>
they can&#39;t earn their own exp, I&#39;ll answer their first few questions, but<br/>
I&#39;m damn sure not waisting night after night trying to teach this lugnut<br/>
things that are easily learned from the manual.<br/>
    Sorry for the rant... just had to get that off of my chest.<br/>

&gt;Saw this on bard message board - made me really sick to read it:<br/>

&gt;(p.s. I sent him a nasty gram back - tellin him he sucks for hurting a<br/>

&gt;Dear God...They are Here!!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok,<br/>
&gt;We knew they were out there. EBay be damned. WHY?!?? I flinched when I saw<br/>
&gt;other classes sold (well, I&#39;d heard about it anyway) but last night, I saw<br/>
&gt;what HAD to be a bought BARD char.<br/>
&gt;Ok...Im calming down. Here it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night, on Mith Marr, I was hunting in North Karana (Im level 17 now,<br/>
&gt;and unless I want to kite, the only way I can go solo anywhere is to kill<br/>
&gt;Borer beetles in NK - why I didnt want to group is another story), when I<br/>
&gt;saw a fellow Bard appear in front of me. He was decked out in nice Steel<br/>
&gt;Armor. He spied me playing my trusty mandolin (I was healing up) and<br/>
&gt;proceeded to ask me a TON of newbie questions...spammed me with them in<br/>
&gt;fact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Where am I?&quot; North Karana &quot;Where is that?&quot; hmmm..level 35...You don&#39;t<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;At this point, I really want to see how new he is...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s the Hall of the Mountain Giants, says I..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;WOW, Can you lead me there?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry, but they don&#39;t like elves there, and I&#39;ll get killed. Giants like<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;though, being human...just go West till you see them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;This is sooo cool&quot; &quot;WOW...look at that&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why not go say hello? He may give you a quest...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(NOTE: at this point, he is still in WALK mode)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;HEY! HELP ME!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Hey...Im in a place called Freeport. Can you tell me how to get to my<br/>
&gt;body?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry pal, you lose everything when you die. Its a shame, but its part of<br/>
&gt;the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/ignore (unnamed newbie)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok. It wasn&#39;t nice. But, I wasn&#39;t in the mood to be nice. That sort of<br/>

&gt;Finale note: I&#39;d do this again and again. Save all flames. I just cant<br/>
&gt;respect anybody who didn&#39;t at LEAST get the exp themselves. This makes the<br/>
&gt;twinking issue moot.<br/>
