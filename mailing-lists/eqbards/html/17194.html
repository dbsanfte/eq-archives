<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800569639">My prime reason for chucking my yaks is the taunt factor. I am usually on <br/>
larger raids lately where any taunting onto me is usually not a good thing, <br/>
and best kept to a minimum (i.e., &quot;an ire ghast feels the force of ykesha, <br/>
an ire ghast hits YOU for 120 points of damage! an ire ghast hits YOU for <br/>
120 points of damage! an ire ghast hi....a_purple_cleric says to the party, <br/>
&quot;aw geez there goes my mana&quot;...)<br/>
<br/>
Other than that they weigh half as much as a Ykesha, they are no drop (no <br/>
worries of them slipping between the cracks of my hotkeyed inventory boxes), <br/>
and yes they DO look nice.<br/>
<br/>
As far as damage comparisons: I have to completely disagree with the notion <br/>
that Yaks will SIGNIFICANTLY outdamage Waks even if you only get 1 proc. <br/>
Waks will generally do more damage OVER TIME. This means little if you are <br/>
fighting short battles. In longer fights (such as against 45+ mobs) the proc <br/>
vs. wak ratio debate loses steam. When you go to the planes almost all of <br/>
these factors come into play. You are dealing with mobs that have upwards of <br/>
12K hp. Most fights are quite long, the majority of Ykesha procs are <br/>
resisted, and the Yaks suck stamina quite nicely in long drawn out fights. <br/>
Of course any bard with his mandolin will twist Jig in as needed in any <br/>
fight. =)<br/>
<br/>
I fully agree that it&#39;s personaly preference. Some people live by the proc, <br/>
others live by the ratio. After having been beat down more than enough times <br/>
I&#39;ve decided to shitcan my Yaks that I&#39;ve owned and loved for 6+ months. And <br/>
let me tell you, my cleric spends a LOT less mana on me, and can worry more <br/>
about keeping the real tanks alive in my party.<br/>

&gt;Agreed, the Claws are far better until 28 when the Staff begins to Proc ;)<br/>
&gt;Once it starts to proc, especially with a good Dex, then you can switch ;)<br/>
&gt;But in the meantime don&#39;t neglect your 1h blunt skill!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to the point about the Wak or Yak...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A LOT of discussion went into these on the Ranger&#39;s boards.  If you aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;worried about the Taunt of the YAK then that is definitely the way to go.<br/>
&gt;Even though it has a lower dmg curve the Proc causes the Yak to out-dmg<br/>
&gt;(rather significantly) the Wak, even if it only proc&#39;s once during a fight.<br/>
&gt;However, the dmg loss isn&#39;t significant to outweigh the greatly reduced<br/>
&gt;taunt factor if that is a major concern for you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A lot of bards opt for the Wakizashi because:<br/>
&gt;a)  Taunts less<br/>
&gt;b)  Looks nicer<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s really a personal choice.  I almost never use weapons myself so I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;that concerned ;)<br/>
