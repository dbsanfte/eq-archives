<div id="ygrps-yiv-479272170">I have decided to make it my goal to attain a staff of writhing because<br/>
I cant imagine anything looking better than someone in platemail armor<br/>
weilding a staff with a skull on top and a sword in his other hand.<br/>
Problem is I dont know where i can find one or about how much they sell<br/>
for. Anyone have any ideas? Also, what level must you be before the proc<br/>
starts going off and can you equip it in your secondary hand slot?<br/>
thanks<br/>
