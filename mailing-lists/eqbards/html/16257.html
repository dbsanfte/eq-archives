<br/>
Sharing Spawns<br/>
We do realize how long it takes. If I had my way, many items would be made<br/>
much more rare than they are, to the extent that no one would camp for them.<br/>
People would then do the dungeons, and if they got something cool it would<br/>
be a real reward.<br/>
<br/>
No, we&#39;re not going to force you to camp. However if you insist on camping,<br/>
then you&#39;ll need to deal with others who insist on camping in a civilized<br/>
manner.<br/>
<br/>
These rules change nothing for people who already work well with others. For<br/>
instance, lets say you are camping something that always has a list going.<br/>
If someone new comes in, putting them on the list is perfectly acceptable,<br/>
much the same as you did before.<br/>
<br/>
These rules don&#39;t let them come in and demand that they get the next loot,<br/>
they only say that you need to work something out, or a GM/Guide will work<br/>
it out for you.<br/>

&gt; Interestingly enough, much of the Prexus community as a whole has chosen<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; ignore the new &quot;Play Nice&quot; rules and continue with what has worked for our<br/>
&gt; server up to this point.  Most high level people and guilds want to<br/>
continue<br/>
&gt; with the &quot;group list&quot; concept in order to manage the number of players at<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; particular spawn point.  Additionally, they are talking about letting<br/>
&quot;high<br/>
&gt; level politics&quot; take care of themselves when it comes to the &quot;whiners&quot;...<br/>
&gt; Those people simply would get left out of the larger undertakings such as<br/>
&gt; dragon raids and plane incursions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Will this work?  Depends on how many whiners out there force Verant to<br/>
take<br/>
&gt; action.  I&#39;ve got a feeling that the moment another party shows up in the<br/>
&gt; Lords room in Lower Guk after the spawn has been broken and demands to<br/>
share<br/>
&gt; the spawn and Verant enforces their policies you will see a TON of people<br/>
&gt; quit the game outright...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For me, this &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy is a GREAT reason to keep my Asheron&#39;s<br/>
Call<br/>
&gt; account active and ready for me to move back to...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Play Nice is doomed to fail.  The number of issues that will come up for<br/>
&gt; &gt; resolution is so much greater than the resources that Verant has<br/>
allocated<br/>
&gt; &gt; to handling them (ie not enough Guides to handle all of the whiners that<br/>
&gt; &gt; will surface.)  Verant should have stuck to the mechanics of computers<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; gives them power: program code.  If a program lets the user do<br/>
something,<br/>
&gt; &gt; some user (or many users) will do that thing. If Verant wanted to stop<br/>
&gt; &gt; KS&#39;ing, they should have done it in code.  That way they stop each and<br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; &gt; instance and rules get applied to everyone.<br/>
