<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617392114">Below is the whole patch message, but here is the bit that is terrible:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g.<br/>
Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells.  As a<br/>
result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while<br/>
under the effect of a DOT.  However, if the regen spell is already in place,<br/>
the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell.  This will allow users<br/>
of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while<br/>
under the affect of regen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I logged in Tszaaz, sang Fufills on myself (finally got it to stick after 3<br/>
tries) then sang hymn, no message, but the icon didn&#39;t appear until Fuffils<br/>
wore off. Now, I did not in fact check my hit points (bleh, stoopid<br/>
no-coffee-yet-testing) but that would be consistant with the message. I<br/>
./feedback&#39;d it, that is a significant nerf.Bleh.<br/>

***Patch Day***<br/>
<br/>
*Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- The &quot;Safe Points&quot; have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of Ill Omen to<br/>
someplace &quot;safer&quot;.<br/>
- You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.<br/>
- Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity<br/>
filter.<br/>
- Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked<br/>
doors.<br/>
- Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against<br/>
non-moving, non-rooted targets.  These restrictions allowed us to enhance<br/>
archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br/>
- Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was intended<br/>
except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br/>
- Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast &quot;Gate&quot;.<br/>
- A large rat says, &quot;Hit by non-melee for XXX damage&quot;, is history.  The new<br/>
message given probably isn&#39;t the source of never-ending humor that the old<br/>
one was.<br/>
- Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br/>
- Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world.<br/>
- Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons.  Take care to take<br/>
a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new gems/icons.<br/>
<br/>
*Poison*<br/>
<br/>
- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).<br/>
- Increased Rogue &quot;Make Poison&quot; skill cap.<br/>
- Substantially reduced chance to fail &quot;Apply Poison&quot;.<br/>
- Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br/>
- Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br/>
<br/>
*General Crafts*<br/>
<br/>
- The Ant&#39;s Potion may now be used anywhere.<br/>
- The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br/>
- The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be<br/>
crafted.<br/>
- The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br/>
- Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br/>
- The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br/>
- The &quot;This item is trivial...&quot; message in craft skills has been replaced<br/>
with &quot;You can no longer advance in skill from making this item&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Items*<br/>
<br/>
- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.<br/>
- The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the player.<br/>
- Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br/>
- There was evidently more than one &quot;Fine Steel Dagger&quot; running around in<br/>
the world.  Some of them have been renamed &quot;Serpant&#39;s Tooth&quot;.<br/>
- The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something a<br/>
bit more useful.<br/>
- The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time.  The function of<br/>
its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a buff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*/consent*<br/>
<br/>
Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to disconnect.<br/>
As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two seconds.  Should<br/>
you be harassed via this tool, please use /report.  Also, please take care<br/>
to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds before<br/>
you can undo it.<br/>
<br/>
*Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*<br/>
<br/>
There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and<br/>
Cazic-Thule.  Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you<br/>
alone.  The significant upside to this change is that the &quot;Cazic<br/>
Gate/Portal&quot; can be made much safer in nature for those who work on their<br/>
faction.<br/>
<br/>
*Regen Effects*<br/>
<br/>
This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g.<br/>
Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells.  As a<br/>
result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while<br/>
under the effect of a DOT.  However, if the regen spell is already in place,<br/>
the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell.  This will allow users<br/>
of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while<br/>
under the affect of regen.<br/>
<br/>
*Keyed Dungeons*<br/>
<br/>
The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message<br/>
from a couple of weeks ago.  Furthermore, when your character dies, keys for<br/>
Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan&#39;s Peak, will no longer remain with your<br/>
corpse, but will instead return with your character to its bind point.  We<br/>
made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of these<br/>
zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.<br/>
<br/>
*Barbed Scale Whip*<br/>
<br/>
In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to<br/>
something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already<br/>
in-game.  It has been changed back to its original stats.<br/>
<br/>
*Hiding Corpses*<br/>
<br/>
A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client.  This command<br/>
(/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC<br/>
corpses on the screen.  This can be very useful once you&#39;ve entered a zone<br/>
with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to decay.  It will be<br/>
particularly useful in the planes.  The command supports the following<br/>
arguments:<br/>
<br/>
- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br/>
- ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your<br/>
group.<br/>
- NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br/>
<br/>
For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone, and<br/>
will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone.  You can reset it<br/>
while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since you<br/>
originally set it.<br/>
<br/>
*Resurrection*<br/>
<br/>
The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person<br/>
casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting.  Furthermore,<br/>
experience will not be &quot;removed&quot; from your corpse until you accept the<br/>
resurrection by choosing YES.  Previously, any resurrection spell, if<br/>
declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br/>
