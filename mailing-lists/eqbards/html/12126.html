<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202609165">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I made level 31 the other day, and a bubble of that exp was made killing<br/>
Giants in N Karana, I think I&#39;ve got the art of charming mastered but I<br/>
just wanted to see if there is anything else I could do to improve things.<br/>
<br/>
First off I equip anything that gives +cha (not alot at the moment), I<br/>
currently have Full Lambent (+10 Cha total) aswell as a Mask of Deception<br/>
(+13 Cha) and a +3 Cha necklace, this gives me Cha of roughly 111 (base<br/>
85), which is not bad but I&#39;m saving for some REALLY good cha jewellery.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of equipping my Crude Stein I equip my MM Drums and start selo. I<br/>
do an /Ooc Anyone see any Giants? And if I&#39;m in lucky I go and pull the<br/>
giant using Charm, then Start up Selo again and run around looking for<br/>
another Giant, in the mean time if I can&#39;t find another Giant I make the<br/>
giant kill guards or Griffennes/Griffons. Whilst charming I run from my<br/>
target (backwards) and stop selo and play Charm, if it&#39;s a succeed I turn<br/>
the giant onto my target then I fire Selo&#39;s up again. I start running<br/>
backwards again(I can outrun giants running backwards). I keep backing away<br/>
and charming until the giant has killed the mob I set him on. I then run a<br/>
distance away from the dead corpse, charm the giant. Sit him down and go<br/>
loot, If I&#39;m lucky I find another giant that I can use to kill my first<br/>
giant and so on until I get bored and zone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite scary having 2 giants on you and it&#39;s easy to make a mistake and<br/>
get killed. 2 Giants pounding on you is not nice, especially if Selo&#39;s has<br/>
dropped. I managed to not get killed whilst charming and I only zoned once<br/>
(made giant attack a druid and the lot came after me). I did however die<br/>
twice (thanks Grimfeather for one and all the guards at the stone bridge<br/>
for the other) this kinda pissed me off cos I lost alot of hard earned exp<br/>
from silly mistakes (mind you having grimfeather beat on you whilst looting<br/>
isn&#39;t a mistake). Even with Selo&#39;s a my MM drums equipped I couldn&#39;t outrun<br/>
him. Lucky I got good exp rez&#39;s both times and only lost 1/4 bub exp in<br/>
total.<br/>
<br/>
Hill Giants seem to be quite rare so it can get boring in N Karana, and<br/>
it&#39;s always f***ing raining in that zone too I&#39;ve thought about trying<br/>
Oasis but the dunes etc put me off and the giants are almost as rare at<br/>
least there is no Grimfeather in the zone (aka death). And the zone is<br/>
smaller which is easier to hunt in, also the people usually /shout Giant to<br/>
Dock etc......<br/>
<br/>
Well, enough of my rabbling, I&#39;m really just interested in some comments,<br/>
suggestions or feedback with regard to my charming methods and places to<br/>
hunt that are good for charming.........<br/>
<br/>
Many Thanks<br/>
