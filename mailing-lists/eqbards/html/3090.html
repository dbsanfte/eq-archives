&gt; as I log in, I get tells asking me if I&#39;m in a group and if not would I like to<br/>

asking if I&#39;d like to join their group.  Usually I&#39;m grouped<br/>
with the same people, a habit I&#39;m trying to break since they<br/>
are mostly West coasters and have this annoying habit of<br/>
keeping me up until 3 am.  :-)  The number of good people I&#39;ve<br/>
met has far exceeded the capacity of my friends list.<br/>

&gt; Personally since getting chain at 23rd I use it heavily, as it noticably slows<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, using Chain and Hymn tend to be exclusive.  Use<br/>
Chain every 3 pulses and the monster will fixate on you after<br/>
about two rounds, making Hymn less effective since you&#39;ll be<br/>
the only one taking damage.<br/>

&gt; cleric in your group that never heals and uses all his/her mana on smite, while<br/>
&gt; you are being beaten to a pulp, do not be so forgiving. That is a TERRIBLE<br/>
&gt; cleric. Does the wizard overnuke in the beginning of every single battle then<br/>
&gt; scream for heals? Overnuking every battle is a sign of a poor wizard.<br/>

still don&#39;t change, then boot&#39;em.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s another thing I&#39;ve noticed.  A lot of people are afraid<br/>
of criticizing how someone else is playing, and so they never<br/>
even make suggestions that could improve the person&#39;s play.<br/>
I&#39;d venture to guess that most people only play one or two<br/>
characters, and thus have little or no idea what the issues<br/>
are that affect the &quot;other&quot; classes (I&#39;m guessing this is why<br/>
a lot of casters seem to be pretty arrogant about tossing<br/>
spells at stuff melee classes are fighting).  What may be<br/>
obvious to you when playing as a group may not even register<br/>
to the other guy.<br/>
