asking if I&#39;d like to join their group.  Usually I&#39;m grouped<br/>
with the same people, a habit I&#39;m trying to break since they<br/>
are mostly West coasters and have this annoying habit of<br/>
keeping me up until 3 am.  :-)  The number of good people I&#39;ve<br/>
met has far exceeded the capacity of my friends list.<br/>

Chain every 3 pulses and the monster will fixate on you after<br/>
about two rounds, making Hymn less effective since you&#39;ll be<br/>
the only one taking damage.<br/>

of criticizing how someone else is playing, and so they never<br/>
even make suggestions that could improve the person&#39;s play.<br/>
I&#39;d venture to guess that most people only play one or two<br/>
characters, and thus have little or no idea what the issues<br/>
are that affect the &quot;other&quot; classes (I&#39;m guessing this is why<br/>
a lot of casters seem to be pretty arrogant about tossing<br/>
spells at stuff melee classes are fighting).  What may be<br/>
obvious to you when playing as a group may not even register<br/>
to the other guy.<br/>
