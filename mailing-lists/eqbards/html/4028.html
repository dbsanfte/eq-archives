&gt; However, one major problem I&#39;ve noticed is that I spend waaaay too much<br/>

&gt; health most of the time. Glancing up to watch the health has to be timed<br/>
&gt; right so I don&#39;t miss a starting message.<br/>

to glace at everyone&#39;s health bars before concentrating on the<br/>
chat window again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your party should surround what you&#39;re fighting.  This gives<br/>
you a better view of possible approaching mobs, gives some<br/>
members an attack bonus for attacking from behind, and lets<br/>
you see your buff songs pulse on your party members.  The<br/>
pulses are in synch with the song messages, so you can use<br/>
those as a signal to start your next song.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to weave one more song that you&#39;re capable<br/>
of, and watch for the disappearing/reappearing icons to signal<br/>
when a song effect has kicked in.<br/>
