<b>Subject:</b> A recap of the 6/6 patch. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-746954232">Lots of Bard news from yesterday&#39;s patch.  Of course as usual none of the<br/>
changes were listed in the patch message (Gordon if you read this put a big<br/>
yellow post-it note on your computer monitor that reads: &#39;ANY BARD CHANGES?&#39;<br/>
*grin*).  Anyway here is the good, bad, and the ugly:<br/>
<br/>
The Good<br/>
-Piercing weapon skill cap has been raised to be in-line with our other<br/>
weapon skills.<br/>
-Psalm of Purity & Psalm of Vitality now cure poison and disease.  The<br/>
drawback is on a cure pulse you lose the resist bonus.  Seems a fair trade<br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
The Bad<br/>
-Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain was stealth nerfed hard last night.  In an effort to<br/>
balance Selo&#39;s Assonait Strane VI put a hard limit on movement speed debuffs<br/>
server side.  Unfortunately the hard limit was based of the spell line with<br/>
the worst movement speed debuff, the necromancer Darkness line.  This nerf<br/>
not only affected our three movement debuffs (Chains, Strane, & Largo&#39;s<br/>
Absonant Binding) it also hit the druid/ranger Snare line.  It testing last<br/>
night Chains did not stop feared or fleeing (non-feared) mobs till about 25%<br/>
health at 52nd level, it used to stop them cold at 50%.<br/>
<br/>
The Ugly<br/>
-Gordon posted the following to the Bard Issues thread on the Sony Gameplay<br/>
forum, my notes are proceeded by *:<br/>

Station Member posted 06-06-2000 06:11 PM         ┬á┬áThis thread will need to<br/>
be closed due to its size soon. When someone reposts the issue, I&#39;d prefer<br/>
it if you could remove the items that we&#39;ve commented on, or at least<br/>
indicate its status.I&#39;ve gotten word on many of the issues from various<br/>
members of the team:<br/>
Purity and Vitality are fixed in code. It should be live now. If it isn&#39;t,<br/>
it is on test and will be live at the next client patch.<br/>
*This is live, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Kellin&#39;s has been referred to our testing department.<br/>
*About time, lets hope they fix lullaby this time.<br/>
<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s Concord is confirmed and agreed as bug. The client programmer has it<br/>
now.<br/>
*This should also fix the problem with Psalm of Warmth & Cooling as well.<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s Constant Chain is in testing.<br/>
*Grrrrr, lets hope they fix the movement debuff on this fast the testing<br/>
referred to is about early breaks.<br/>
<br/>
Angstlich&#39;s Appauling Screech: Fear spells do not cause NPCs to stop<br/>
casting. Works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Solidarity of Vision: Works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Johthan&#39;s Provocation: We&#39;ve reduced the fizzle rate and added the message.<br/>
Remainder works as intended. Changes are live.<br/>
*These changes did not go live.  It still fizzle way too much and has no<br/>
added message.<br/>
<br/>
Niv&#39;s: Works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Song of Travel: Opinions requested and placed on the board. I believe the<br/>
consensus was to remove the invis component, yes?<br/>
*To quote Gordon &#39;Ack!&#39;, a thread has already started to keep Song of Travel<br/>
as is.<br/>
<br/>
Largo&#39;s: Range has been increased. Changes are live. Still looking into PvP<br/>
behavior.<br/>
*No feedback or testing on this yet.<br/>
<br/>
Nillipus&#39;: Works as intended currently. We&#39;re open to removing the damage<br/>
shield component if you wish. Thoughts?<br/>
*To quote Gordon again, &#39;Ack!&#39; This is a specialized song that has some<br/>
great uses. I personally hope they leave it alone.<br/>
<br/>
Song of Twilight: Works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Assonant Strain: fixed as requested.<br/>
*Fixed and nerfed<br/>
<br/>
Bombastic Bellow: Fixed and live.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Broken Quest Issues&quot; are not broken quests. They are preexisting<br/>
stories for future expansion.<br/>
*Not sure if this applies to Fabian or not.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kunark Armor&quot;: Well my list says &quot;fixed&quot; but I don&#39;t have what they ment by<br/>
that. If any changes have been made they would be live.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it for this installment <br/>
