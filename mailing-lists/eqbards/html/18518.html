<div id="ygrps-yiv-110456130">Thanks for the support guys... FYI, if you check the Cazic-thule corner<br/>
you see that the guilds there limit Dragon runs to those 46 or higher. I<br/>
dropped all of the 15oo Plat I had in my pockets and am camping there.<br/>
If they dont let me in, maybe I can get a hand me down MM... sigh. If<br/>
nothing happens over the weekend I will head to Kedge Keep and look for<br/>
a certain Mermaid :)<br/>
  <br/>
  Back to lurking, I am with you guys everyday :) ..just tongue tied in<br/>
the glory of your wisdom :)<br/>
  Back to NONSTOP Chicago Blues !!! as Moonflower strips more paint off<br/>
Garbage Trucks on the High Notes !</div>
