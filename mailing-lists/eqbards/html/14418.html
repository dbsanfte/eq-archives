&gt; Thats funny.  My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>
&gt; assertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>
&gt; Paladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>
&gt; types, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>
&gt; time thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>
&gt; levels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve played this way a lot.  It works great until you run into<br/>
the NPC corollary of the caster/melee imbalance - a caster<br/>
mob.  Those will drop a group member before the others have<br/>
time to taunt it off him.  For that reason, I&#39;d recommend the<br/>
group have 2+ paladins minimum, or swap one tank for a cleric.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s actually the typical group I play in - a cleric, bard,<br/>
and 4 tanks.  Based on discussions I&#39;ve been having on other<br/>
boards, apparently we take a really long time to kill stuff<br/>
(1-3 min vs 15 sec to 1 min) compared to other groups.  Our<br/>
downtime is typically 0-30 seconds though.  It is a lot of fun<br/>
IMHO compared to the 1-dimensional nuke it as fast as you can<br/>
approach.  Small adjustments like which songs you play have<br/>
time to make a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
At really high levels, like Harmonic says, melee starts to<br/>
become more important than the casters due to resists<br/>
(defensive casters like clerics aren&#39;t affected by this).  <br/>
Unfortunately, that&#39;s due to there being different rules for<br/>
mobs vs. players which IMHO is always a bad thing.<br/>
