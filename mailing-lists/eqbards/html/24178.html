<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936683616"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; shada i believe said we are already balanced or even <br/>
&gt; overpowered in the non uber raid<br/>
&gt; arena.  how would this not make us overpowered or overpower <br/>
&gt; us even more in this<br/>
&gt; area?  how would this even help us in the uber raid area <br/>
&gt; since most nonlure type<br/>
&gt; damage spells are heavily resisted anyway?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i never mentioned this song had anything to do with balance, or that i<br/>
wanted it to be helpful on an uber raid, just that i believe it is useless<br/>
and i will never mem it.<br/>
