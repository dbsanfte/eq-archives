<div id="ygrps-yiv-730991408"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;That&#39;s not exactly what I said.  I wasn&#39;t commenting<br/>
&gt;specifically on their solo capability.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes I know you weren&#39;t commenting specifically on<br/>
their solo ability, sorry if that was the implication.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One necro is better than a group of 2-3 L50s (maybe <br/>
&gt;more, depending on class makeup).  You&#39;d have to be a<br/>
<br/>
&gt;fool not to want one in your group.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is treading onto another topic where I personally<br/>
feel that from an efficiency standpoint you&#39;d never<br/>
want some classes in your group (Paladin for example,<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any situations where I&#39;d want a<br/>
Paladin over a Warrior).  So yes I&#39;d take a necro over<br/>
3 paladins in a group that already had a warrior and<br/>
cleric.  However i&#39;d take an enchanter before a necro<br/>
as the 3rd member in that same group (presuming<br/>
equally skilled and equipped players, etc, etc).  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I could see passing up necros for if someone else <br/>
&gt;(especially a buffer or healer) were available, but <br/>
&gt;if there&#39;s an empty slot and a necro comes a-looking,<br/>
<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another side note here...when adding someone to a<br/>
group i&#39;ll usually add the best player I know who&#39;s<br/>
there rather than add a class...unfortunately most<br/>
necro players i&#39;ve seen really don&#39;t know their class<br/>
very well at all.  I&#39;m friends with a *very* good 50<br/>
necro and she has openend my eyes to how good the<br/>
class can be (including how they&#39;re more broken with a<br/>
manastone than clerics are :).  Even considering<br/>
necros to be the most powerfull (raw power) class I<br/>
think is an understatement as they have quite a bit of<br/>
versatility as well.  Heck most necros think they<br/>
can&#39;t break the ghoul lord or even the frenzy room in<br/>
LGuk solo since the last patch, its really quite easy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you look at the formulas I whipped up for the <br/>
&gt;seven-string lute comparison, you&#39;ll see that the two<br/>
<br/>
&gt;primary factors in a fight are damage rate, and <br/>
&gt;survival time (rate of damage taken).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re missing something else, and that&#39;s<br/>
something to deal with time to kill and downtime.  For<br/>
example, two wizards can nuke something to death very<br/>
quickly but then sit and med up inbetween fights.  A<br/>
warrior and cleric could tank/heal/med and fight<br/>
constantly with no downtime but the fights take<br/>
longer.  In my experience the 2nd group will be much<br/>
more efficient over time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In other words, &quot;great solo, poor grouped&quot; is a <br/>
&gt;contradiction.  The worst you can get is &quot;great solo,<br/>
<br/>
&gt;ok grouped.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re also forgetting to account for how the solo&#39;ing<br/>
is accomplished.  A necro can solo outdoors with fear<br/>
kiting, using his pet as a dot, and the efficiency of<br/>
lich+bond of death+manastone to *gain* mana while<br/>
doing damage.  This is significantly easier in the<br/>
outdoors with lots of room than it is in solb/lower<br/>
guk.  I don&#39;t think its as clear-cut as you may think.<br/>
 (Remember I do think necros are great in a group, but<br/>
not overpowered IMO.)  Oh and this brings up what is<br/>
IMO the single most powerfull aspect of a necro...mana<br/>
efficiency.  If you played magic: the gathering you<br/>
know that the single most limiting thing in the game<br/>
was drawing 1 card per turn...this turned card<br/>
advantage into the way to win.  In EQ its all about<br/>
mana efficiency IMO.  (Mana can convert to damage,<br/>
hps, etc all very easily and efficiently and there are<br/>
only a handfull of ways to increase mana recovery<br/>
rates...hence its the limiting factor to efficiency.)<br/>
<br/>
From someone elses post:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;All I know is that a level 50 necro in the group <br/>
&gt;allowed us to take the lords room in lower guk easily<br/>
<br/>
&gt;and hold the room for hours without so much as a hint<br/>
<br/>
&gt;of a challenge.  He left and was replaced by a level <br/>
&gt;50 wizard and we all died the next lord spawn and 2 <br/>
&gt;tries later we still couldn&#39;t retake the room...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well that&#39;s a poor example.  Two different players can<br/>
be very differing in ability to play the game.  (Being<br/>
level 50 does not mean you have any clue at all about<br/>
EQ is one of my main problems with the game...witness<br/>
any 50 warriors out there still wearing serp bracers,<br/>
exe hoods, etc.)  So the necro could have been a very<br/>
good player and the wizard a very poor player.  Also<br/>
you&#39;d need to tell me more about the groups involved. <br/>
If there was no tank then the necro might have been a<br/>
necessity for his pet.  If you had a good tank and<br/>
healer and the spawn was broken the wizard should have<br/>
been just fine.  Yeah yeah i&#39;m rambling on I know I<br/>
know... :)<br/>
