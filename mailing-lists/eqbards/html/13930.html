<b>Subject:</b> RE: My overcrowding solutuion (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630439424"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Have you tried this?  Even L30 mobs take enough out of you<br/>
&gt; that soloing you can probably only keep 5-15 mobs clear before<br/>
&gt; they start to respawn.  (Unless you&#39;re a necro, then you can<br/>
&gt; keep all the seafury cyclopses in OOT clear solo.  :)  A L50<br/>
&gt; in a L15 dungeon like Befallen I can see killing everything<br/>
&gt; that moves, but there&#39;s really not much there to attract a<br/>
&gt; L50.  There&#39;s the paw quest, but that&#39;s easily solved by<br/>
&gt; moving that quest item to a higher level dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, but think of the overcrowding.  I almost never group with less then 6.<br/>
Look at Sol A today.  A single level 50 can single handedly take out the<br/>
Predator, Foreman and camp the Efreeti all at the same time.  Why would they<br/>
do this?  Well, Kobold Hide Boots, Platinum Arm Bracer and an Obsidian<br/>
Shard.  Think of the number of high level druids that come to Sol A for<br/>
these things...  Imp Skin gloves, Molten Cloak, Drake hide belt, Drake hide<br/>
sleeves and pants all are sought after by level 50&#39;s as well often.  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen level 50&#39;s do a lot more then that in Sol A as well.  I&#39;ve also seen up<br/>
to 7 level 50&#39;s, all solo, in Sol A at the same time in the past.  Think of<br/>
how many groups of high 20&#39;s and low 30&#39;s that displaces.  Trust me, 7 level<br/>
50&#39;s can control practically all of Sol A leaving not much for anyone else<br/>
to hunt.  Where do they go to hunt?  Now throw in perpatual overcrowding,<br/>
thanks to Verant&#39;s poor planning, and suddenly the game is broke.<br/>
<br/>
Now turn this same scenario into a dungeon crawl.  You end up with mabye 5<br/>
to 10 level 50&#39;s crawling through a place like Sol A killing everything that<br/>
moves and all playing solo so that they can get their shot at the named<br/>
spawn.  Suddenly the overcrowding situation has just gotten 10 times worse.<br/>
As for loot, there is a heck of a lot of level 30 loot that level 50&#39;s still<br/>
wear (especially druids) and let&#39;s not even bring into this Item Farming for<br/>
e-bay, Item Farming for platinum and Twinking...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You do have to share the mobs with other groups.  It&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; not obvious because it gets mixed into the time it takes your<br/>
&gt; puller to find something.  If there are 20 people in a dungeon<br/>
&gt; with 100 mobs that respawn every 30 minutes, then that&#39;s 5<br/>
&gt; mobs per person per 30 minutes.  Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; camping one spot or sweeping through.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where do you pull to?  If the spawns are random, then suddenly there aren&#39;t<br/>
any safe rooms to fight in or pull to.  Also, have you ever pulled Kobolds<br/>
in Sol B?  There isn&#39;t ever enough to go around and there is no clear<br/>
distinction of where one camp ends and another starts.  What happens is that<br/>
it is common for it to degenerate into the puller trying to out damage,<br/>
nuke, charm, etc. another puller so he can get the mob back to his group.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It will be the same - the rate at which mobs respawn has not<br/>
&gt; changed.  Better sweepers would have an advantage, but better<br/>
&gt; pullers have an advantage now.  The overall rate of mob killer<br/>
&gt; per person per hour cannot change.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Giants in Rathe Mountains are another example of this... They seem to spawn<br/>
randomly around one of the central areas there.  If you get a two or three<br/>
groups and maybe a level 40+ hunting them, then suddenly you end up playing<br/>
&quot;pull wars&quot;.  In addition, to make matters even worse, with the way Verant<br/>
has designed the game, you often can&#39;t tell if a mob is engaged or not.  Now<br/>
put this degenerate situation in a dungeon setting where valuable loot is<br/>
the reward and you end up with hell part 2.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Aren&#39;t most of the magical items in AC randomly generic, like<br/>
&gt; in Diablo?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, but they also have EQ similar &quot;unique&quot; items that are available only by<br/>
quests.  I&#39;ve not played a lot, but I do know of a quest for a powerful<br/>
sword that requires 7 keys from beginner dungeons.  It&#39;s not uncommon for a<br/>
high level player to &quot;higher&quot; newbie players with equipment or money to go<br/>
into the dungeons that he cannot to collect the keys so the quest can be<br/>
completed.  The newbies get to hunt without competing against a higher level<br/>
player, get great experience at the same time and if they want to, they can<br/>
grab 2 keys in each dungeon and get the sword for themselves as well.<br/>
Suddenly you have a different twist on a player based economy :-).  I&#39;m not<br/>
saying its better, I&#39;m just saying that EQ as is is broken.<br/>
