Identify has its uses actually. With it you can identify for instance the<br/>
Ancient coins used in the nostrolo tamborine quest.<br/>
Agreed there are periods of a bards life that are a bit boring, but I think<br/>

in terms of their ability to solo and fill many roles in a group.<br/>

mentioned, identify and the magic weapon one, are laughable. They do not<br/>
even<br/>
have utility.<br/>
