<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819272087">I really like being a wood elf for RP reasons, but here are some things I<br/>
noticed:<br/>
<br/>
- Humans have better bardic stats, Half Elves come in second (This depends<br/>
some on what attributes you want to pump up in character creation)<br/>
- Wood Elves can wear small or medium armour (Humans and Half Elves wear<br/>
medium only)<br/>
- Wood Elves and Half Elves can see in the dark<br/>
- Humans tend to have better *overall* factions (this could be moot<br/>
depending on your deity choice)<br/>
- Kelethin is a great area for a bard to get started because of the spider<br/>
silk quest. Humans in particular have a hard if not impossible time running<br/>
this quest<br/>
- Wood Elves end up with better forage skill<br/>
and...<br/>
- Wood Elves don&#39;t have to duck as much<br/>
- Wood Elves get stepped on a lot<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others can come up with some good feedback too.<br/>
<br/>

what does everyone think is the best places to put the<br/>
extra attribute points into?  also, what is the best race<br/>
for a bard?<br/>
thanks<br/>
