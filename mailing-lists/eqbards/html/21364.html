<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268771376">I&#39;m still having fun playing Tani - not disillusioned at all yet.  However,<br/>
whenever I mention how much fun playing my bard is, all the 55+ bards in my<br/>
guild just about roll over laughing and say &quot;just wait&quot;... like I&#39;ve said<br/>
before, I think Verant sees Bards as their &quot;crowning achievement&quot; and just<br/>
can&#39;t see why we&#39;re complaining.  Either that, or the person they originally<br/>
had design the Bard has left and nobody knows how he coded it or such :) <br/>

Halana, 56th Shaman aka Raptor Fodder<br/>
Tani, 28th Bard of SPLAT (was running along in Overthere in the fog....<br/>
there&#39;s a big chasm there :))<br/>

&gt; i don&#39;t think crowd control or dealing without lullaby is the <br/>
&gt; issue for<br/>
&gt; most.  we have all dealt without lullaby for a year.  it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; the way bards are<br/>
&gt; being treated by verant.  as i think kitasi said, i would never have<br/>
&gt; expected to see lyrnia go as she was an avid supporter of <br/>
&gt; verant decisions<br/>
&gt; (nothing wrong with that, just saying).  the way they make <br/>
&gt; decisions about<br/>
&gt; bards is what i think people can no longer stomach.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Since I have given up ever getting mez again, I have moved on with<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Dark)Elfson Allegro.  My guild has fallen in love with City <br/>
&gt; &gt; of Mist this<br/>
&gt; &gt; week (after past affairs with Dalinars and Kaesora).<br/>
