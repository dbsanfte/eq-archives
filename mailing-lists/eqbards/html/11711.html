<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671936650">Heh well my primary char is a Necromancer and all I can say is bring one<br/>
along. I&#39;ve cracked the room solo. The mix of feign death with charm is<br/>
deadly and in Lower Guk a Necromancer is just a great class to have in your<br/>
group especially if he has all his 49 spells.<br/>

&gt;that cleric of yours is a must.  if one of your group is an enchanter, you<br/>
&gt;should be good.  that way you can fight the ghoul lord alone while his 2<br/>
&gt;guards are out of the fight.  if you do not have an enchanter, i would<br/>
&gt;suggest that you pixie strike one of the guards while everyone else takes<br/>
&gt;out the lord.  it would be quite difficult, but you could try messing both<br/>
&gt;guards, if you can get it to stick.  may as well have dirge up, it&#39;s only<br/>
&gt;300+ dmg but it enabled my very unbalanced group (i.e. we should not have<br/>
&gt;tried it hehe) to kill the lord once.  we all died, but we got the sword<br/>
&gt;first =)  the key is to stagger the spawn.  keep the guard you are on<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for a couple minutes after the initial fight, if you all survive.  most of<br/>
&gt;your group should be 45+, not 40+.  the lord is 48ish and his guards are<br/>
&gt;45ish, give or take.  good luck.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hello all, I have been reading the list for about 2<br/>
&gt;&gt; months now and I<br/>
&gt;&gt; am very impressed with the collection of knowledge here. My<br/>
&gt;&gt; friends and I on<br/>
&gt;&gt; Tribunal server have just joined the 40+ club and are looking for<br/>
&gt;&gt; information on camping the SSOY (Ykesha). I am a 46th lvl Bard and my<br/>
&gt;&gt; friends are all 40+ including a 50th cleric. We are all<br/>
&gt;&gt; looking around for<br/>
&gt;&gt; any information regarding this camp and if anyone might share<br/>
&gt;&gt; some tips<br/>
&gt;&gt; and/or advice it would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
