<div id="ygrps-yiv-940344067">Not taunting hardly qualifies as lowering their combat effectiveness<br/>
significantly.  That&#39;s like asking a rogue not to pick pockets while<br/>
fighting.  Taunt is very specialized to get creatures to attack them instead<br/>
of someone else.  I&#39;ve never had to have our SK back out of a fight yet.<br/>
He&#39;s usually the target for the first 15-30 seconds of a fight but they<br/>
always switch to me soon thereafter and no amount of backing out by me has<br/>
ever helped unless I do it as soon as they switch to me, which kinda defeats<br/>
the purpose.  We&#39;ll see how the taunting reduction affects this and how they<br/>
decide to implement it.  The first &#39;smart ass&#39; comment on my guild list was<br/>
that in order to reduce bard taunt, using Verant logic, they would probably<br/>
give all bard songs a refresh time of 20 seconds.  I wish I could say I was<br/>
100% certain that the idea was ridiculous, but it sent a chill down my spine<br/>
just to hear it suggested.<br/>

*Grin* I have on occasion asked a Paladin/Warrior NOT to taunt (use<br/>
one of their specials) for a while. To spread the damage out over<br/>
all in the party. And we have had our Shadowknight back out of the fight<br/>
entirely so that he will aggro more firmly on me and spread out damage more.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I can see asking a warrior not to use his extra attacks for part<br/>
of a fight, if it makes the whole more efficient.<br/>

&gt;Another point on the idea of backing off or waiting to nuke in the case of<br/>
&gt;casters.  Because they have limited mana, if a caster nukes in the first<br/>
&gt;half of a fight or the second half of the fight it doesn&#39;t matter they do<br/>
&gt;the same damage and are just as effective damage-wise either way.  They<br/>
&gt;would be wasting mana if they nuked constantly anyhow.  If a bard doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;sing for half the fight its a huge hit to their effectiveness, since there<br/>
&gt;is no wasting of mana to deal with.  Would anyone seriously ever suggest a<br/>
&gt;ranger only dual-wield for part of a fight?  Or that a warrior not use his<br/>
&gt;extra attacks for part of a fight?  Of course not.  The main reason to have<br/>
&gt;nukers wait is because they have limited mana anyhow and they will avoid<br/>
&gt;getting hurt and still do just as much damage by waiting.  Bards<br/>
&gt;do not have<br/>
&gt;this luxury.<br/>
