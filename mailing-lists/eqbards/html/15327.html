<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298948857">Ah, the fun of real life. Good travels to you Harmonic. I&#39;m sure we all hope<br/>
to hear from you in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lucky enough to get my wife to start playing recently. I scrounged<br/>
up a 2nd computer so we can play side by side. It&#39;s made life a lot easier,<br/>
however I haven&#39;t been playing Windleaf as often since I&#39;m playing a new<br/>
character along with her (I&#39;m a cleric, she&#39;s a ranger, both level 10 right<br/>
now). (We have a 9 month old daughter, but find time to play when she goes<br/>
to sleep.)<br/>
<br/>
We both enjoy the game a lot and continue to meet very nice people and will<br/>
keep playing. Any game has problems, even non computer ones. (Heh, anyone<br/>
play Star Fleet Battles (pre-doomsday) or even Magic the Gathering? Talk<br/>
about rules problems. :-D )<br/>
<br/>
Also, the unique thing about Everquest is that I can play cooperatively with<br/>
my friends. I&#39;m a pretty competitive guy, and my friends (and wife) were<br/>
getting tired of me clobbering them in games (cruel Magic the Gathering<br/>
decks and ruthless Star Fleet Battles tactics). So despite any flaws of<br/>
Everquest, this is the game that I&#39;m going to continue to play. Makes my<br/>
friends and my wife much happier. :-)<br/>

&gt; First off, Ryan, I think you made the right decision ;)  My <br/>
&gt; GF and I have <br/>
&gt; had to make concessions to my current 96 hour-a-week schedule (which <br/>
&gt; included getting her a job here so we see each other more often <br/>
&gt; *grins*).  I also haven&#39;t played EQ in 2 weeks, and haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; logged more <br/>
&gt; than 10 hours in the last 3 months.  I have been playing AC a <br/>
&gt; bit lately <br/>
&gt; (Valentine&#39;s day present from the GF), and am disturbed to <br/>
&gt; discover that I <br/>
&gt; actually like it.  It seems a lot more laid back (of course, <br/>
&gt; so does EQ at <br/>
&gt; lower levels).  The graphics aren&#39;t as nice - and I&#39;m all <br/>
&gt; about graphics - <br/>
&gt; but the dynamics are really great.<br/>
&gt; I dunno - I&#39;ll probably just keep bouncing from game to game. <br/>
&gt;  Maybe some <br/>
&gt; day someone will make one that everyone likes.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   First of all, I&#39;m still around, I read you all everyday. =D<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I haven&#39;t played Everquest in about 2 weeks now.  I may not<br/>
&gt; &gt;   play Everquest again.  In short, the game was taking away time<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I needed to spend working and most importantly taking care of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   my girlfriend.  For almost 14 months (since beta 3) she has<br/>
&gt; &gt;   endured 6-8 hour sessions of EQ on a daily basis.  Clearly,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the game came before she did in all cases.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Everquest wasn&#39;t that great either, I know I complained about<br/>
&gt; &gt;   it often, but I&#39;d keep coming back for the people when I could<br/>
&gt; &gt;   have turned and looked 5 feet beside me and spent time with<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that one person who counted.  Everquest/Verant are full of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   shortcomings and I kept hoping that things would finally get<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;work properly&#39; - but that was just a dream.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I want to play again, just not now.  Things are going very well<br/>
&gt; &gt;   right now and I don&#39;t want to bring back the frustration that EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt;   caused me.  I&#39;ll read the posts here where relevant, but I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;   post much.  I&#39;ve got big work projects demanding more and more<br/>
&gt; &gt;   time.  I&#39;ve also got a kitten and a beautiful girlfriend demanding<br/>
&gt; &gt;   more time as well.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to return <br/>
&gt; and play the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   length of time I once played.  But I hope to return soon, maybe in<br/>
&gt; &gt;   a few more weeks.<br/>
