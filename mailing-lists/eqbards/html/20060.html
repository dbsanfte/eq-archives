<b>Subject:</b> Solo Spectre Camp Break? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073303268">I was cruising my little &#39;ol blue level 33 self across the Oasis and <br/>
recalled that I was able to charm a Spectre not to long ago (with lots of <br/>
resists, but I was successful).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone successfully broken the camp solo? The Spectres are so slow and <br/>
we can run over the water pretty easily, figured someone must have done this.<br/>
<br/>
I did a little test and charmed one , but watched my &quot;pet&quot; go running off <br/>
in the direction of the gypsies. I turned and zoned when I saw his 3 <br/>
buddies come floating my direction, as I didn&#39;t want any innocents killed <br/>
while I&#39;m just messing around. I thought it was strange that my charmed <br/>
Spectre didn&#39;t just come to me. I was heading to guk so I didn&#39;t stay <br/>
around to fiddle with this.<br/>
<br/>
Lamenting didn&#39;t seem to be the simple answer as I doubt I&#39;d be able to <br/>
keep the levitation up long enough to lament 2 of them and pull the other 2.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, soloing hill giants/cyclopses are probably easier, but this one is <br/>
just a little cooler.<br/>
<br/>
I may try again some late night when there aren&#39;t as many gator killers <br/>
around. The only other spots I know where there are Spectres are the undead <br/>
island in OOT (not a great place to test this stuff out at) and Feerott <br/>
(which I don&#39;t have a lot of experience at).<br/>
<br/>
But any suggestions would be very welcome!<br/>
