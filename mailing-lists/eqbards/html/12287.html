<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-75012975">I made 30th level over the holidays and since then have died twice.  The<br/>
first time I died was in the assasin room in lower guk.  I got killed by an<br/>
one of the undead ghoul wizards (conned red to me). I noticed that the<br/>
amount of experience on the bar didn&#39;t visually drop very much.  Second time<br/>
I died I was in Mistmoore.  Party was fighting in the secret room behind the<br/>
crypt when we got a bad pull.  Deathly harbingers and ushers beat me up<br/>
pretty good.  Started running to the zone when a pledge familiar (caster<br/>
type) joined in the fight.  Pledge familiars con either low blue or green to<br/>
me.  Even though the deathly harbingers and ushers did 90% of the damage<br/>
against me, the pledge familiar got in the killing blow.  I noticed that the<br/>
experience bar visually dropped a lot more this death than it did when the<br/>
red ghoul wizards killed me.  I have noticed a similar trend over the life<br/>
of my bard as well.  Just paid more attention it to it now that I&#39;m in a<br/>
hell level.  Subjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty for<br/>
dying is higher when something kills you that cons green/blue to you versus<br/>
something killing you that cons yellow/red.  Anyone else had similar<br/>
results?<br/>
