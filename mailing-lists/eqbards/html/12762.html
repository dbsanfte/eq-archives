<div id="ygrps-yiv-60534047"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is that confirmed by testing or a subjective theory?  I always equip my<br/>
&gt; flute when I want to improve my chances of getting a charm or pixie strike<br/>
&gt; to stick.  First time I think I&#39;ve seen a post that said the flute didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; help with charm or pixie.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Charismatic, most definitely does nothing.  As the faction rate is<br/>
  fixed, regardless.  I tested this, thoroughly with a flute a long<br/>
  time ago.  Just stating, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in question.<br/>
<br/>
  Since I got my new flute, and made sure it worked like a flute<br/>
  (tested invis, and it worked) I&#39;ve been going back and trying<br/>
  out songs to see what if anything this flute or my normal flute<br/>
  would do.<br/>
<br/>
  Charm, well since I&#39;m much higher than the highest level mob<br/>
  I can charm, I think the level difference really plays more<br/>
  of a role in the resist.  While waiting for a trip to Hate <br/>
  near the wizpad in South Ro, I tested out my flute on sand<br/>
  giants.  Out of 10 times trying to charm the giant with a<br/>
  flute I got 2 resist.  Out of 10 times trying to charm the<br/>
  same giant without the flute, I got 1 resist.  (got lucky,<br/>
  as it were since I would expect to see 1 resist in 10, which<br/>
  is acceptible to me)  I suppose a closer match would have to<br/>
  be done to test without such a big level difference.  I can<br/>
  say that when I first got the song, I used a flute exclusively<br/>
  and never saw any more or less resists when I stopped using <br/>
  the flute in highkeep charming goblins.<br/>
<br/>
  Pixie, good old pixie.  A flute doesn&#39;t do a damn thing to this<br/>
  song heh.  Pixie strike lowers MR by X amount whether a flute<br/>
  was used or not.  Exactly 9 MR reduction at L50 on myself. <br/>
  Although it may have changed, cause I could have sworn it used <br/>
  to do more than that.  Anyway, for the stun component I used the <br/>
  mean little Ogres guards.  And results over the 2 hours I was <br/>
  there followed the same pattern, whether I had the flute in<br/>
  my hand or not, I would only be able to stick 2 or 3 attempts<br/>
  out of 10 tries during each battle.  The flute, if it was doing<br/>
  anything, made no significant visual results.  This was as of<br/>
  last night.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, I will be testing it all over again tonight as well.</div>
