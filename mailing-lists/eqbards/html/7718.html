<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955297105">Oooh, I need some clarification on this phrase:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Only a bard with levitate can make it up there.  (since our levitate<br/>
continues to make you rise up)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am still a few levels away from the Aria of Eagles but am I to understand<br/>
that you do not remain hovering at the approximate 6 foot level off the<br/>
ground that you do when levitated by the magician&#39;s spell form?  I would<br/>
like to understand the workings of this song if anyone can elaborate.<br/>
