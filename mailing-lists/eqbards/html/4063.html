&gt; Doesn&#39;t the crown look like banded?  I know its good, but don&#39;t know if I<br/>
&gt; could go back to wearing the &#39;saucer hat&#39; :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;d personally keep it. If you do sell it, you&#39;ll probably find<br/>
yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; going to runnyeye in 10-20 levels to go get it again. It may not seem<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; useful right now, since you&#39;re not fighting that many spellcaster, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that&#39;ll change pretty quickly. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d tend to concur.  The crown is a very nice item.  250pp may<br/>
&gt; &gt;seem like a lot at your level, but it isn&#39;t really that much<br/>
&gt; &gt;later on.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still a sizable sum in<br/>
&gt; &gt;your mid 20s, but it&#39;s &quot;I just have to save up for it,&quot; not<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;I&#39;m never gonna be able to afford that.&quot;  Most folks in their<br/>
&gt; &gt;30s tell me they have over a thousand pp and nothing to spend<br/>
&gt; &gt;it on (I&#39;d be close to that except I&#39;m spending it on small<br/>
&gt; &gt;steel plate).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You should be able to trade the crown for a nice item if the<br/>
&gt; &gt;+resists don&#39;t really get you excited (I don&#39;t think they help<br/>
&gt; &gt;bards as much since we get a whole slew of resist raising<br/>
&gt; &gt;songs that are more effective than the spells).  Like maybe a<br/>
&gt; &gt;battle drum.  :-)  The crown is just into the difficult-to-<br/>
&gt; &gt;obtain range where high level folks will make trade-only<br/>
&gt; &gt;trades for it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The crown is on my L28 bard&#39;s list of items I&#39;d like to have<br/>
&gt; &gt;if you&#39;re curious how desirable it is.<br/>
&gt; =================================================<br/>
&gt; I concur with John<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am level 35, and I JUST got the Blackened Iron Crown. It is GREAT. I<br/>
spent<br/>
&gt; hours at this level with another friend camping the King. Got the<br/>
Grotesque<br/>
&gt; Mask about 4 times before we got the crown. Then, I left. I didn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; feel bad, as I didn&#39;t get ANY XP for the whole venture, and I didn&#39;t see<br/>
ANY<br/>
&gt; other groups come in and complain. I got what I needed, and took off. No<br/>
&gt; farming for me, thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, the crown is sweet. AC 5, +5 STR, and +5 to all resists. Man, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; REALLY nice!!!  Keep it, you won&#39;t be sorry!<br/>
