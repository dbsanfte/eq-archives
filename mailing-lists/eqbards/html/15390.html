<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069026561">Wow - 35% haste!!! &lt;drools&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My was not that HP or mana is useless but here is an item that is _supposed_<br/>
to be a great dragon loot item.  Ok, 35% haste is &quot;great&quot; but is a 50 HP<br/>
buff considered &quot;great&quot; ??? Or even &quot;good&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
[Sat Feb 19 23:53:19 2000] You slash Warlord Skarlon for 9 points of damage.<br/>
[Sat Feb 19 23:53:19 2000] Nadare begins to cast a spell.<br/>
[Sat Feb 19 23:53:19 2000] Warlord Skarlon kicks YOU for 53 points of<br/>
damage.<br/>
[Sat Feb 19 23:53:20 2000] Warlord Skarlon hits YOU for 122 points of<br/>
damage.<br/>
[Sat Feb 19 23:53:20 2000] You have become better at Defense! (196)<br/>

Boy oh boy, am I glad I had that 50 HP extra...<br/>
<br/>
I subscribe to the &quot;only HP and AC matter now...&quot; school of thought and have<br/>
my 2x55hp rings and am trying to get my +sta necklace back from the person I<br/>
loaned it to.  Well actually, I am still big on resists too MR is good.<br/>
<br/>
But my points were:<br/>
<br/>
1. they tried to make some good items<br/>
2. they got some stuff right (haste effects)<br/>
3. they wanted to have stats matter (agi, dex, etc. are boosted) but<br/>
somewhere dropped the ball as these things no longer seem to matter (which<br/>
is not to say that they might fix it someday)<br/>
4. they did not seem to know the &quot;value&quot; of specific numbers (50 HP, +10<br/>
mana) when viewed in the broad scheme of things<br/>

&gt; 1) its a back item, not shoulder.<br/>
&gt; 2) its haste is over 2x that of a fbss (35% v 15%)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; as far as HP or mana items being useless, that is just the opposite.<br/>
since<br/>
&gt; stats don&#39;t do as much as we thought, ac and +hp items are the most<br/>
&gt; important thing for melee classes now.  hard to find a smart melee class<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; wearing two 5ac 55hp rings.  even i wear them now. </span></blockquote></div>
