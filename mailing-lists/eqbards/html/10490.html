&gt; There&#39;s one thing I noticed when twisting songs and would like you<br/>
&gt; experienced Bards out there to share your observations. Whenever I stop a<br/>
&gt; song in attempt to start second song, there&#39;s a time lag when we can&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; sing the second one (it says &quot;You have not recovered..&quot; just like inbetween<br/>
&gt; casting spells). I noticed that under different circumstances, the delay<br/>
&gt; (or the &quot;recovery period&quot;) doesn&#39;t seems to be the same.<br/>
&gt; I noticed it when I was using my friend&#39;s computer 450MHz in the first full<br/>
&gt; screen mode (press F10 once from the default screen) and right after I<br/>
&gt; stopped the first song (say CoD) I can NEARLY immediate start second one.<br/>
&gt; That day, I was twisting FOUR songs very happily. When I got back home, I<br/>
&gt; tried to do it again (with 300MHz computer), i have to particularly wait<br/>
&gt; (about one second) for the icon to show up again before i can weave in a<br/>
&gt; second song. Twisting three was as much as I could do at that time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When you stop a song, you have to wait for the button to<br/>
&quot;ungrey.&quot;  The speed of that animation depends entire on the<br/>
frames per second you&#39;re getting.  If you&#39;re on a slow system<br/>
or lagged due to spell animations, it&#39;s going to take longer.  <br/>
On my original K6-200 system, it was impossible to play more<br/>
than 2 songs at a time because the buttons took over a half<br/>
second to ungrey.  Right now on my 550 MHz system, I play in<br/>
D3D mode, even though glide mode produces cleaner output with<br/>
less jerkiness.  The D3D mode has a higher fps, and the slight<br/>
difference is very noticeable when I start pounding at the<br/>
song buttons.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably my biggest gripe about the interface.  It<br/>
makes sense when applied to spellcasting (the spells usually<br/>
remained greyed for several seconds after casting, so an<br/>
extra quarter second doesn&#39;t really matter), but is really<br/>
stupid when applied to our songs.<br/>
