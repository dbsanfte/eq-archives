<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095974885">Hmm a screen shot i looked at beofre posting showed it as PE not CM but i<br/>
thot i remembered it as CM - maybe they changed it &lt;sigh&gt;  And yes 5 charges<br/>
- not sure how many icons it strips each time - hehe and it strips from top<br/>
down so if you were heavily buffed...&lt;click&gt; goodbye symbols, goodbye valor,<br/>
goodbye spirit armor, &lt;click&gt; goodbye sow... etc etc until goodbye root.<br/>
<br/>
Does the cazic gate potion gate you to your bind spot or to the wizard gate<br/>
in CT?  I dont know if i&#39;d wanna come out of Lguk hurtin&#39; and be dropped<br/>
into the CT maze - when you are real low HP even the green trash that is<br/>
normally non-agro will be on you.  For evac, you really wanna have a druid<br/>
or wiz.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can buy a gate potion for a measly 1000pp or so.  I actually saw<br/>
some one use it (a heavily twinked young warrior to boot!).<br/>

Quick note,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Egg Shaped Pumice stone: 15-18 plat<br/>
Contains 5 charges of &quot;NULLIFY Magic&quot; as I use these alot and my necromancer<br/>
has the spell Nullify removes TWO enchantments at a time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Golem Wand from cazic Thule-5 charges of &quot;Pillage Enchantment&quot; as I am<br/>
holding mine in reserve for when  I run out of pumice stones deep in lower<br/>
guk I have not used it yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also another priceless object to be gotten bu bards..<br/>
<br/>
The Cazic Thule Gate Potion. Dopped by the Cenobite in the avatar of fear<br/>
room. Its suposedly the &quot;common&quot; drop off the cenobite the rare drop being<br/>
the rogue only raven scale boots. Although the cenibite to me the other<br/>
night RARELY EVER spawned. Just a darn justicar in his place.<br/>
<br/>
I plan on having me a few gate potions on hand when I decide to live in<br/>
lower guk for a while.<br/>
