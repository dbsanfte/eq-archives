<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Cahnt Series Fixed was: Instrument vs. melee attacks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754658407">Yes!  They fixed it and upped the damage when you equip a drum and use the<br/>
songs (F... Curtailing Chant 30, T... Chant of Flames 38, & T... Chant of<br/>
Frost 46).  And special instruments add even more!!!<br/>
<br/>
Last night we went to Hateville to murder and pillage the locals.  (Maestro<br/>
dropped an Evensong - grats to Kaldivar, Inny dropped the Necro book - grats<br/>
to vamprilla and the shaman hammer Gardash - grats to Evel, Samine got<br/>
cleric gloves - grats and that was about it for 7 hours of pillaging.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, Kaldivar and me started out doing chants with MM drums.  He got<br/>
dismayed with the lack of information re damage numbers and went back to<br/>
swords.  I pretty much stuck with chants and drums.  The warrior in my group<br/>
thought I should go back  to melee.  Why, I asked him.  Well, your songs<br/>
will make them agro on you; can&#39;t you just melee with no songs?  If I melee,<br/>
even with no songs, I will get hit enough that I have to back out of combat<br/>
to stay alive or drop one sword for a shield.  Well, using just songs, over<br/>
the past 2 hours have I been healed one time? &quot;No, not even once,&quot; says our<br/>
cleric.  I am kinda liking this - standing just outside of melee range and<br/>
applying damage.  Seems like everyone else was doing just enough to keep me<br/>
off the hate list - not summoned even one time.<br/>
<br/>
Now how much damage was I doing.  That is a bit harder to gauge.  I&#39;d say on<br/>
average, resists were running about 25-30%.  Might be kinda skewed by Spite<br/>
golems because they are immune to magic and it took me awhile to remember<br/>
that and switch back to blades.  Clerics of Innoruuk also had very high MR<br/>
and were resisting but eventually I was sticking them as well - esp if they<br/>
got tash, malosai or whatever.  The Kiri&#39;s, Ires, rats, & Foresakens had<br/>
much lower resists.  The maestro, well I wanted to try CoC, CoD, DDD on him<br/>
but was cautioned against AE songs in there - guess we had an enchanter try<br/>
AE one time with rather disastrous results (although I think it was a patrol<br/>
group that got agro&#39;d and Bard AoE might have been ok - except that the<br/>
Maestro does quite a bit of flying around so it could be tricky and targeted<br/>
DoTs probably a better choice.)  When it came time for Inny, I got dropped<br/>
to the desktop and by the time I got back in and found where we fought him,<br/>
he was laying in a heap on the cobblestones.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a good night in Hateville. Only 1 death on the run in.<br/>
Left with nearly a bub of xp (guess we got our share of kills from those<br/>
DoTs - our group was bard, cleric, ench, war, sk, ?) Yes, it would have been<br/>
nice to nab some imbrued items but there is always next time ;p Soon, I will<br/>
be ranting about the lousy drop rates, too.  But the crew in PoF took down<br/>
CT and got -- 12 gold.  Really. Now that is _really_ wrong!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; so are you saying that the chant series are fix now even with instrument?<br/>
&gt; Because it used to be that it does not matter if you use an instrument or<br/>
&gt; not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>

&gt; Ok, I did a quickie chart to list all of our damage songs and fill in some<br/>
&gt; numbers:<br/>
