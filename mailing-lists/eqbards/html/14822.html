The Ghoul Lord room is a camp for a 45 to 50 level group if they have to<br/>
break the room. Lev 50 necro&#39;s, and enchanter & cleric teams excepted.  In<br/>
the old days, it could even be a 2 group effort. You won&#39;t be going there in<br/>
a level 38 to 43 pick-up group.  I got mine young because my guild members<br/>
who have leve 50 broke the room and we camped it.  I needed help just<br/>
getting to the room.<br/>

You might want to keep both items - exe hood and bic.  Use the BIC when you<br/>
need the resists over the dex (dragons, casters, etc.)  Dex seems to help to<br/>
a certain degree ie: there are break points.  If the +9 gets you over 100<br/>
dex then it prolly helps. but if it moves you from lo 80 to lo 90 - maybe<br/>
not as much. It depends on where you are with dex now.<br/>
