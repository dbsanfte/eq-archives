5 casters in The Overthere. I&#39;ve never done it since as that was one of the <br/>
most boring things I&#39;ve ever done.<br/>
<br/>
I always love being in a group that has a couple of tanks as I can combat <br/>
buff them very nicely then hymn/clarity/cantana during downtime for the <br/>
casters. Definitely ideal.<br/>
