&gt;told him that he had to be kidding, it&#39;s going to take longer to kill the<br/>
&gt;mobs and you will be healing more.  He was the only caster in the group, so<br/>
&gt;I choose to buff the melee people.  After a couple minutes of arguing about<br/>
&gt;it (he found out I was right) he said, &quot;got to log, bye&quot;.<br/>

&gt;The mana song is a blessing and a curse.  Get a friggin&#39; enchanter if you<br/>
&gt;want constant mana regen.<br/>

&gt; &gt;threaten to kick me out when I refuse to just play manasong in actual<br/>

5 casters in The Overthere. I&#39;ve never done it since as that was one of the <br/>
most boring things I&#39;ve ever done.<br/>
<br/>
I always love being in a group that has a couple of tanks as I can combat <br/>
buff them very nicely then hymn/clarity/cantana during downtime for the <br/>
casters. Definitely ideal.<br/>
