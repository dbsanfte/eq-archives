<div id="ygrps-yiv-186122553">I&#39;ve never had an opportunity to go on a Vox raid. Perm is so far out of<br/>
the way it&#39;s a major effort for a small guild like mine to sponsor a raid.<br/>
Any organizing is especially hard since I play late hours PST when the<br/>
Xegony pop drops to under 1500 or even 1000.<br/>
<br/>
And last time I participated in a Naggy raid no scales dropped :(.<br/>
<br/>
In summary, I&#39;m seriously thinking of moving on and getting back into some<br/>
XP grouping. And now that charm is nerfed I want twilight so I can again<br/>
be a CC asset.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad we don&#39;t have a voting tool on this list. Would be interesting to<br/>
see how many people think it&#39;s still worth it to wait around.<br/>

there is no reason for aVox/Naggy raid to fail.  The melee damage output<br/>
with kunark/sov weapons isso much higher than what those 2 were tuned for.<br/>
 Not to mention these raidsoften have access to high level buffsThe<br/>
problem (at least on the raids I went to) is that the munchkin mob hashad<br/>
enough time to get to 50 now.  Obviously there were lvl 50 idiots<br/>
prekunark, but they were less and often easily identifible (from what I<br/>
washearing at that time).  Now they have Sebillis keys.When I went on my<br/>
first Vox raid, I sat there silently, in terror that Iwould screw<br/>
something up.  I turned off guild chat and told all my friendsto not send<br/>
me tells.  I asked this list and the high level bards (I think Isent you a<br/>
tell Sartori, hehehe) what I should be doing.I am not talking about a<br/>
young guild/ coalition making an honest attempt atVox and failing here.  I<br/>
admire people who try new (to them) things.  I amtalking about a vetran<br/>
raid leader who can&#39;t get enough competent playerswho merely listen to him<br/>
to kill a old world dragon.  I am talking peoplewho blantantly ignore the<br/>
directions given to them by the raid leader.Theres nothing hard about<br/>
understanding &quot;DO NOT BUFF YOUR PARTY.  NO ONESHOULD HAVE ANY BUFFSIF YOU<br/>
HAVE BUFFS, DISPEL THEM.&quot;  Theres nothing hardabout &quot;Do not send me tells<br/>
about loot, the looting rules were made publicbefore the raid and will be<br/>
repeated before we make groups.&quot; There isnothing hard about &quot;Do not move<br/>
past me, if you fall in a pit or agro a mob,especially Vox, do not try to<br/>
run, just stand there and die, we will rezyou.&quot;/rant offElfson Allegro 55<br/>
