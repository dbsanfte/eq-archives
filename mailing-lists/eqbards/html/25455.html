** Melee changes **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re wrapping up an extensive look at the way that melee works in<br/>
EverQuest.  These changes are appearing now on Test (in fact, most of them<br/>
are working as of right now).  We wanted to make you aware of these<br/>
changes in some detail so that you can give us the feedback that we need<br/>
on them.  Please try these changes out and comment on results that you&#39;ve<br/>
seen.<br/>
<br/>
We will be beginning our final analysis on casters in the very near<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
* Melee Tables *  <br/>
<br/>
Melee combat is based, at least in part, on tables that determines how<br/>
each class functions.  Up until 50th level melee and hybrid classes are on<br/>
the same table, with the exception being monks who are on a separate table<br/>
(one that has them doing more damage).  At 50th level warriors, rogues and<br/>
rangers were all moved to the monk table along with the monk, who did not<br/>
receive a new separate table.<br/>
<br/>
The problem here is that post 50th level the disparity between these two<br/>
tables, combined with lower combat abilities for the hybrids as well as a<br/>
more restricted selection of weapons acted as a double (almost triple)<br/>
penalty, making them less effective in combat than was really intended.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, all melee and hybrid classes will be basing their combat off<br/>
the melee table once they reach 51st level.  This should increase the<br/>
combat effectiveness of hybrids noticeably.<br/>
<br/>
Monks, however, are intended to be somewhat better at dealing out damage<br/>
in combat than warriors.  To slightly improve their combat prowess they<br/>
will be working from an improved combat table once they reach 55th level<br/>
and again at 60th level.  This will improve the combat ability of monks<br/>
somewhat, essentially placing them a half a step ahead of everyone else in<br/>
toe-to-toe combat in the same way that they were prior to 50th level.  The<br/>
rogue will still maintain a margin of superiority when you consider their<br/>
ability to backstab.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Two-Handed Weapons *<br/>
<br/>
The effectiveness of these weapons falls slightly below our desire for<br/>
them.  This tends to make those that rely on them most often<br/>
(shadowknights and paladins) also fall slightly behind our desires for<br/>
their damage output, at least at levels beyond 50.  We&#39;d also like to see<br/>
a broader range of weapons used by higher level warriors, and it would be<br/>
nice to see two-handers as a more viable option.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, we will be increasing the minimum damage of these weapons for<br/>
all classes once they reach 50th level.  There will be an increase in the<br/>
minimum damage of two-handed weapons based on the wielder&#39;s level and<br/>
delay of the weapon.  The higher level the character and the larger the<br/>
delay, the bigger the bonus.  Obviously we&#39;re not going to give out exact<br/>
numbers, but this should result in a solid increase in damage output when<br/>
using two-handed weapons.<br/>
<br/>
We also believe that there has been a bit of disparity between the very<br/>
high-end one-handed weapons and their counterpart two-handed weapons.  The<br/>
ultra-high end one-handed weapons are comparatively better than their<br/>
two-handed counterparts.  We will, on a case by case basis, be improving<br/>
many of the high-end two-handed weapons.  Because this is essentially a<br/>
fix for an oversight on our parts, we will be making these changes<br/>
retroactive (meaning you won&#39;t have to trade the items in or hunt for new<br/>
ones, existing weapons will just change).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Rangers *<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also noticed that rangers, while intended to be hit harder in combat<br/>
than other melee/hybrid classes, are getting hit harder than we planned. <br/>
Again, this only happens in the 50+ level range.  So we will be increasing<br/>
the defense cap for rangers again slightly to 210 at 60th level.  Exactly<br/>
how these points will be distributed is uncertain, but probably just one<br/>
point per level after 50.  We will also be giving rangers triple attack.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Monks *<br/>
<br/>
Monks will be getting triple attack.  This along with the improvement of<br/>
their combat tables should place them about where we want them,<br/>
combat-wise.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Bards *<br/>
<br/>
Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage<br/>
physically of all the classes we&#39;re discussing.  However, with their lack<br/>
of double attack they didn&#39;t meet even our intentions for their damage<br/>
output.  We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon<br/>
caps for bards over 50th level to match that of warriors.  This should<br/>
place their ability to do damage by means of melee within our intended<br/>
range without making them more effective than the knights at any given<br/>
level, since double attack is a potent melee skill that bards do not get. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously we want to see how this all pans out when applied to the game. <br/>
Feel free to send your comments on the results you see to us through the<br/>
Developer&#39;s Corner on our web site, or contact our staff if you see them<br/>
on the Test Server.<br/>
<br/>
It is very important that you understand that these are changes that we<br/>
are testing.  These changes (and any others made on the Test Server) may<br/>
not be moved to Live Servers.  After all, that&#39;s the reason we&#39;re testing<br/>
them.<br/>
