<div id="ygrps-yiv-834746241"><blockquote><span title="qreply">&gt; 	 Well last night me and my friends were killing gnomes for about 3<br/>
&gt; hours, then all of a sudden, a kill stealer we&#39;d met in highkeep (which we<br/>
&gt; reported and he got a warning for it) quite a few levels ago shows up and<br/>
&gt; decides that he was going to take the gnome we just snared and nuked 2<br/>
&gt; times. So i quickly run over to my druid that is pulling, charm the gnome<br/>
&gt; over and over.... Oh dear, mr kill stealer which just blew all his mana<br/>
&gt; seems pissed and is threatening to call a gm on us. By all means mr kill<br/>
&gt; stealer, call a gm to report us for stealing our gnome back.  Funny thing<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; that this guy allready got a warning in the past cause of the same<br/>
&gt; situation<br/>
&gt; in highkeep once and was talking to the guide for over an hour when that<br/>
&gt; happened.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	He quickly left the zone after all this happened. Seems that no one<br/>
&gt; wants to mess with a bard hehe.  My friends love me now that im 32, with<br/>
&gt; charm im the ultimate tool against want to be stealers, and i have mana<br/>
&gt; regen now, life was sweet last night. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	P.S. I wish there was Dark elf bards, because i love being evil<br/>
&gt; sometimes </span></blockquote></div>
