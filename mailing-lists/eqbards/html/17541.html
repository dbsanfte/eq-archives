&gt; Somebody smarter than me used Baldur&#39;s Gate as an<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s the thing.  I disagree with the comparison to<br/>
Baulder&#39;s Gate.  Yes you don&#39;t directly improve yourself by<br/>
passing on items that someone else can use better.  But in the<br/>
long run, it is better for everyone if people cooperate like<br/>
this.  I won&#39;t get into a full blown discussion about the<br/>
reasons why this is, but you can look it up on the web pretty<br/>
easily.  Just do searchs for &quot;prisoner&#39;s dilemma&quot; and &quot;tragedy<br/>
of the commons.&quot;  In a nutshell, both of these describe<br/>
situations where the most advantageous decision from an<br/>
individual standpoint results in the worst possible outcome<br/>
for all parties involved.<br/>
