<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317162779">Where is J.M. when you need him, this whole topic has become so obfuscated<br/>
that we are defeating the purpose of helping one another and just confusing<br/>
matters worse.  So and so says this and so and so says that.  I have heard<br/>
on the one hand the Smedley says CHA is used by bards and then someone else<br/>
says the opposite - as yet I still have no idea if the truth is out there.<br/>
Oh where oh where is my Scully to help me get to the bottom of this?<br/>

&gt; &gt; At 120 charisma I consider the number of missed notes I get to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be intolerable.  I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>
&gt; &gt; this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; &gt; how any of you are able to stand it.  I worked on my enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; this entire weekend because I actually get to play the game,<br/>
&gt; &gt; instead of assidiously watching the chat window for &quot;missed<br/>
&gt; &gt; a note&quot; messages.  I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>
&gt; &gt; tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>
&gt; &gt; on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>
&gt; &gt; frustrating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My understanding of this, based on conversations with some <br/>
&gt; GMs and high<br/>
&gt; level bards<br/>
&gt; as well as my own experience is that missed notes is related <br/>
&gt; to dexterity,<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; charisma.  It&#39;s hard to notice a difference, because it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; surely just a few<br/>
&gt; percentage points, but I feel like I miss fewer notes with a <br/>
&gt; grotesque mask<br/>
&gt; on than<br/>
&gt; without.<br/>
