<div id="ygrps-yiv-319650706">The Jig &quot;effect&quot; has always been a heated debate amongst bards.  I<br/>
personally believe that it DOES NOT increase mana regen.  The best way to<br/>
experiment is to have a caster cast the same spell as fast as they can until<br/>
the can&#39;t cast anymore (OOM).  Time them to full mana.  Repeat the same<br/>
scenario and time them while playing the Jig.  I think you&#39;ll find no<br/>
respectable deviation.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, if someone drops you from a group for not playing a certain<br/>
song, then you didn&#39;t want to be with that group anyway.<br/>

Hi all<br/>
<br/>
When I play EQ I allways get asked to play the Jig to increase mana<br/>
regeneration. I was asked this for 4 times today and I really hate it. I<br/>
even got kicked from a group when I refused to play it because the mana is<br/>
not regenerating faster. Can anyone recommend me what to do?<br/>
I have one more problem. I&#39;m lvl 15 at the moment and I can hardly ever solo<br/>
a blue creature. I&#39;m wearing full banded armor, and I have my 1H slash<br/>
allways maxed. I&#39;m using tentacle whip as a weapon, no it&#39;s not twinked I<br/>
got it as in a bet when someone didn&#39;t beleive me that selo&#39;s is faster than<br/>
sow. And I just bought the armor. Can anyone please tell me why can&#39;t I solo<br/>
a blue creature without loosing 90-95% of my health.<br/>
