&gt;we tried to kill some bandits in the bandit camp. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;interested in input for how I can allow my more of party <br/>
&gt;to survive a battle, including myself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First off, two bards is one too many at that level.  You<br/>
really need a cleric (who can buff you better and heal <br/>
you better than the druid can)  Keep the druid off the<br/>
ignites, and keep them on the healing + thistleshields.<br/>
<br/>
At your level use your Lament song to shut down any extra<br/>
bandits and try to pull them one or two at a time.  Note<br/>
that bandit casters usually don&#39;t charge you and will cast <br/>
from afar, you need to be careful with them.  Eliminate <br/>
the non-casters by good lament/harmony pulling.  Then<br/>
rush the casters.  Tactics at this level consist mostly<br/>
of good pulls, as you have very little songs to your <br/>
disposal.  Make sure everyone has _every_ buff, then <br/>
you should Twist Anthem/Healing (with lute in hand) and<br/>
do _not_ engage in battle, in fact stay behind everyone <br/>
else out of melee range, and make sure the warrior/rangers<br/>
attempt to pull extras you may accumulate off you.  You may<br/>
want to delay playing songs until most of the enemies are <br/>
being attacked by your party.  This reduces the mobs from<br/>
fluctuating onto you in the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve fought bandits, but keeping<br/>
it simple is best.  And you&#39;ll find many of these tactics<br/>
you learn now, hold true until 50 (or at least 38 &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
