&gt;Question to all servers once again? Has *any* imbrued armor dropped since <br/>
&gt;the patch on this past<br/>
&gt;Wednesday? The armor was supposedly moved to the plane of hate since it is <br/>
&gt;no longer dropped on<br/>
&gt;boogeymen, but none has dropped yet on any mobs on my server (Tarew Marr). <br/>
&gt;I&#39;m starting to<br/>
&gt;believe Verant forgot to put our stuff in after they jacked it from boogeymen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regarding the Maestro, how far in is he? You said it took 8 hours. And how <br/>
&gt;hard is he? Does he<br/>
&gt;cast any special type of spells?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, when pulling mobs, have you had any weird bugs, where a single mob is <br/>
&gt;pulled, and about 3<br/>
&gt;minutes into the fight, 5 - 10+ mobs come outta no where and wipe out <br/>
&gt;everyone? Even with monks<br/>
&gt;feign pulling, and staying feigned while the rest of us fought so to keep <br/>
&gt;aggro clear, we still<br/>
&gt;get trained everytime.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Scorn banshees drop our armour, and they have for our team, though only 2<br/>
pieces have since we started on the poh. (got almost a full backup set of<br/>
imbrued :). They also drop a martune rapier that is 8/23 5 str, 4 agil, no<br/>
proc. Not bad, but i am sticking with the dual ykeshas. How to get to<br/>
him... well its really a freaking maze in the poh, i cant think of an easy<br/>
way to describe it. Have a de necromancer that worshippes innoruk and has<br/>
never killed anything in mistmoore scout for you in wolf form (dunno if if<br/>
they have to be a de necro that worshipps innoruuk, but i am pretty darn<br/>
sure they cant have hunted in mistmoore before). <br/>
<br/>
We just killed the maestro for the first time while i was typing this.<br/>
Dropped a paladin only erudite shield of all things (phobus, the resident<br/>
lazy erudite paladin was estatic :). First time i saw him he had a mace<br/>
(the cleric only one that procs banish undead?) but we didnt get to kill<br/>
him that night and the server reset before we had another chance. He is a<br/>
freaking monster, hits for 200+, has a aoe life tap (at least thats what<br/>
everybody kept saying, i never noticed), and an enourmous amount of hps<br/>
(well if he does have an aoe lifetap that would explain his supposed 6<br/>
gazillion hps). <br/>
<br/>
On wierd trains... yeah we get that alot too. If you use our bind sight to<br/>
watch the pullers work (usually one monk and one de necro in wolf form who<br/>
scouts for us) you will see mobs run EVERY which way after they fd. It is<br/>
insane the paths they take, and i imagine that just like the pof they are<br/>
running around transfering their hate list to every mob in the zone. After<br/>
we have cleared a bit it gets better, still get the occasional train and<br/>
everybody dies (one person camps out to do rezzes, saves money :). The<br/>
developers are well aware of this, and are basically using us as a guinee<br/>
pig. Whether they will fix this i dont know, time will tell =(<br/>
<br/>
We still have a ton to learn in the poh, but like the pof we are getting<br/>
better and better. I know other servers use monks to pull... but tunare<br/>
just started doing this. Before we always specialized in crowd control. We<br/>
have several high level enchanters that mez and 2 lvl 50 bards that mez<br/>
also. Now that we have added a monk to start fd pulling, we are starting to<br/>
do much better. Course the monk makes me feel like we are cheating... we<br/>
pulled the maestro past 15 guards solo using fd. 8p<br/>
