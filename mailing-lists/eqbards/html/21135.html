<div id="ygrps-yiv-666147301">This time the guide is lifted from a great site run by Banzeye. It has been<br/>
edited for both format and content. I recommend reading the buffing section<br/>
from the first guide as well as the info on mobs. The full version can be<br/>

BREAK IN STRATAGY<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the numbers we can get more specific on strategy. Aegis Terra<br/>
on Tarew Marr (thanks to Thumpa and Saerli) was able to break the patrol<br/>
with around 16 folks so weather or not it&#39;s possible is really a moot point,<br/>
it&#39;s just how fast you can move from there. If you have numbers in the 50&#39;s<br/>
you could make short work of it as long as most of the casters split into 2<br/>
or 3 groups and alternate the burn cycle. <br/>
Feign Death (FD) pullers will be a factor, Enchanters will be a factor,<br/>
Clerics will be a factor, all are encouraged to come. <br/>
<br/>
West wall camp is too dangerous. It may be a possibility if we have 4+<br/>
enchanters and a good working grasp of the assist key. <br/>
<br/>
The default plan is a north wall camp. This plan calls for a very seasoned<br/>
crew of Fear terrain at least for the patrol break up. If you don&#39;t  know<br/>
Fear well for the love of God wait until the patrol is broken. I imagine<br/>
that safe time would be around 3-4 hours after the initial zone in.<br/>
<br/>
Objectives:  <br/>
Kill patrol  <br/>
work toward the Gorgan tower  <br/>
use gorg tower as a base to kill the 3 mini bosses  <br/>
Kill lower Mobs  <br/>
kill temple  <br/>
work to Cazic  <br/>
Kill Cazic <br/>
<br/>
If you get a glut of folks I hope that they will cooperate and do rounds in<br/>
waves non-stop. If this is the case you can assign wave leaders once patrol<br/>
is broken. If you&#39;re not up, sit down, don&#39;t move or cast. Every bit<br/>
contributes to link death after 50 people so be warned. <br/>
<br/>
SUICIDE RUN<br/>
<br/>
A very fat tank needs full armor, spirit of the wolf, and lots of buffs on<br/>
to pull the entire patrol with him/her on a wild goose chase to the north<br/>
thus claering the port for the wave behind. 2 or more may be used but it is<br/>
better to save extra tanks to be buffers near the North camp in case a<br/>
cleric pulls some heat and is getting hit.<br/>
<br/>
This was the plan I posted for a raid on Tarew Marr that was able to break<br/>
and hold the zone with minimal casualties:<br/>
<br/>
I will do a suicide run to the north wall and draw fire (patrol mobs) until<br/>
we have a good core of folks in the camp spot 12:00 of the fire ring at the<br/>
temple. The second wave should have a few clerics and a few tanks, if I miss<br/>
mobs on my first pass the other tanks should grab the mob and join me in my<br/>
suicide circle in the NW. Once the core clerics make it to the north camp,<br/>
camp. I will die in the NW corner and wait for my FD puller to get my<br/>
corpse. Other groups should follow immediately after the core clerics for 4<br/>
reasons. <br/>
<br/>
1) More fodder for the patrol to get distracted on while the clerics camp <br/>
2) More of a start up team to take down the glare lord should he be there<br/>
when the re log procedure starts <br/>
3) More people to to relog on before the clerics to make sure the coast is<br/>
clear <br/>
4) The window of opportunity to run in free of a patrol will only last about<br/>
90 seconds before the patrol closes up again. After that window you must die<br/>
at the patrol to join the break in or wait until the patrol is clear.<br/>
 <br/>
If you agro the patrol go die in the NW corner and don&#39;t train the camp. Go<br/>
in invis. because if I do my job right all the see invis mobs will be<br/>
chasing me around the north end of the zone. <br/>
<br/>
If you go in the first wave here is what to expect: <br/>
I will get some buffs and wolf and port in. About 10-20 seconds later<br/>
someone in my group will give a GO! This means zone in. <br/>
<br/>
Once you zone you will see an hr glass to the right of you hovering in the<br/>
air. Make a b-line for it. When you get close to it (not too close mind you,<br/>
that tower has crap that wants to kill you) head north toward the fire wall.<br/>
Once there skirt the outside of the firewall to the left (clockwise) until<br/>
directly 12:00. There is a glare lord that cycles through this spot once<br/>
every 2 hrs or so, but is the only real obstacle here. If a scarling happens<br/>
to get there by negligence run, don&#39;t walk with it to the west corner.<br/>
Scarling is the only monkey wrench in this as they can port you into the<br/>
firewall and bring the whole Amygalian Army on top of us. <br/>
<br/>
Once we stabilize the North camp we can proceed to take down the shiverbacks<br/>
and spine chillers first. Then move on to scarlings proceeding with extreme<br/>
caution. Scarlings should be mem blured because once you get high on the<br/>
agro list they start porting you around. <br/>
<br/>
About getting ported:  You will always be able to see the camp from where<br/>
you are ported or feared. Don&#39;t panic. Look around 360 to check your agro,<br/>
if you picked something up go kite it in the NW corner until we can eat it<br/>
or you die and we rez you later.</div>
