<div id="ygrps-yiv-212651497">There is lots of debate among programmers about how random the<br/>
random number generators used in computer programming really are,<br/>
and the merits and flaws of various methods of generating a random<br/>
number. If you play Nethack, you will notice the same types of<br/>
problems with their RNG (random number generator) There is no<br/>
perfect way of doing this. Just lots of options. Amazingly<br/>
enough, generating a true random number is not as easy as it<br/>
sounds.<br/>
