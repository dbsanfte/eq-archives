<div id="ygrps-yiv-977824152">Honestly, Sylly, lately I&#39;ve found your posts almost impossible to<br/>
read.  I&#39;ve even been deleting some of them unread.  I know some<br/>
people find it faster to type that way, but the time you save typing,<br/>
I spend trying to decipher what you meant.  And, to me at least, its a<br/>
sign of someone who doesn&#39;t care how they&#39;re presenting themselves to<br/>
the rest of the list.  In email (and Usenet, as this also holds there)<br/>
we can only judge you by the style of writing you use.  And whether<br/>
you hold any intelligence or not, that style tends to make people<br/>
look less than intelligent.  In any case, I&#39;m not telling you to<br/>
*stop* using d00dtype, but I delete it if I can&#39;t decipher it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not bashing Sylly here; from previous posts, I do think he has a<br/>
clue.  I just want to make sure that other people can *see* his clue.<br/>
