<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229188070">Well they are designed to be armor you gain from levels 25-40.<br/>
(assuming 25-40 is &quot;mid-level&quot;)  If you finished at 34 then <br/>
you had &quot;easy&quot; quests.  I personally looted from others kills<br/>
the following items, any bard with invis song could get these items:<br/>
<br/>
Mudwater Rune from Cazic<br/>
Opalline Helm from Oasis<br/>
Shin Gauntlets from Lguk<br/>
Shin Greaves from Lguk<br/>
Icy Greaves from Perma (semi-risky, ... not really)<br/>
2 Runes from the One-Eyes in WK<br/>
Lute in Mistmoore<br/>
... and more.<br/>
<br/>
I was overjoyed my quests were this easy at first...then it kinda<br/>
hit me that i was a blueboy at level 25, and would be wearing mostly<br/>
the same stuff until the 40s.<br/>
<br/>
I think the armor quests were designed to make us go to unexplored<br/>
parts of the world, but the bard quests just seemed to be on a lot of<br/>
the monsters that were already killed, sometimes killed a lot.<br/>

&gt; I agree with Kitasi here.  I don&#39;t think our quests are all *that* easy.  I<br/>
&gt; started doing them at around level 27 and I can assure you that I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; find most of them trivial.  My set wasn&#39;t complete until about 34th.  Sure,<br/>
&gt; some pieces are easier than others, but even if you&#39;re simply looting quest<br/>
&gt; items from other people&#39;s kills, it&#39;s still pretty risky.  The Dark Bone<br/>
&gt; bracelet from the basement of Unrest, the Basalt Carapace from well inside<br/>
&gt; Lower Guk, the Gypsy Lute from the heart of Castle Mistmoore, the Icy<br/>
&gt; Greaves from the King Room in Permafrost, these are not easy things to get<br/>
&gt; for a lower level bard even if you&#39;re scavanging other&#39;s kills.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The bard quests may be easy at 30th level, but I have not found them<br/>
&gt; &gt; particularly easy at 20ish.  On the other hand I completed my<br/>
&gt; &gt; fourth shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; piece last week with my 21st level bard, and I did all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; required killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself for 3 of the pieces.  I&#39;ve also done 3 crafted quests,<br/>
&gt; &gt; including the<br/>
&gt; &gt; slaying required, and 1 ranger piece.  I&#39;m halfway thru about 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard pieces.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you think our quests are easy try some of the others, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; make ours look<br/>
&gt; &gt; many levels off for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have had no luck getting the icy greaves despite trying four times now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve spent about 6 hours in the king room with no luck.  I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; others have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been more fortunate on this note, but since the critters involved<br/>
&gt; &gt; are still<br/>
&gt; &gt; far beyond my means for almost all the bard quests, while the critters for<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of the other classes&#39; quests are not, I don&#39;t believe ours<br/>
&gt; &gt; are as weak<br/>
&gt; &gt; as people seem to think.  Our quests are relatively easy for the level<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant seems to think should be doing the quests (30-35).  Other<br/>
&gt; &gt; classes can<br/>
&gt; &gt; get some pieces 10 levels before this easily although some of their pieces<br/>
&gt; &gt; may be fairly difficult.<br/>
