An Ode to an Elemental<br/>
<br/>
Nothing makes me madder than<br/>
A battle without a plan.<br/>
I watch you get distracted<br/>
By each and every hand.<br/>
<br/>
Fight one opponent solely<br/>
Until you run him through,<br/>
Or else your indecision<br/>
Will drive you to your doom.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen your ilk go through this<br/>
Since I was a mere young lad.<br/>
You let others taunt and distract you<br/>
Which leads to nothing but bad.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember in the future<br/>
When attacked by more than one knife.<br/>
Just repeat the following slogan<br/>
Because t&#39;will surely save your life!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll teach you to interfere with me<br/>
Just as soon as this terror is slain<br/>
Because I&#39;m not as stupid as you are<br/>
I kill the first before causing you pain.</div>
