Talies: I&#39;m thinking the Howler lute is nodrop. It comes off a named gnoll<br/>
in the pit in Velkators. If that guild does dragons, is dragon capable, you<br/>
may mention a Selo&#39;s drum. They are tradeable, and if the rest of the guild<br/>
bards have one, they are just spare loot. They drop off a couple dragons so<br/>
not all that rare a dragon drop. Of course they should have the option of<br/>
offering you some other nice item as well. I&#39;m a rotten trader though so my<br/>
opinion isn&#39;t worth much. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Epic: Gore: well I bound my wiz at perma and made it a daily habit to check<br/>
for her and Gore every day. Also had my guild and our friends in other<br/>
guilds watching out for her. One day about a week ago she spawned right<br/>
after I had made my rounds. A guildmate was in DL when she spawned, so I<br/>
just started /w all looking for all those people and guilds I have helped do<br/>
epic stuff. Calek brought a bunch of SoA&#39;s and Sebastiian brought some DK&#39;s<br/>
and we fielded a group or 2 from VS, plus ones and 2&#39;s from other guilds. I<br/>
had a large turnout ready to go in about an hour and we rocked! We will<br/>
probably be killing Gore and Vox more as we have Paladins needing the frost<br/>
book still. <br/>
My red scale came from Ragefire. My fianc├® is a cleric (Klaget) and we<br/>
finally got the Ragefire camp about a month ago. We camped for like 4 days<br/>
straight and dropped a red scale for me along with Klaget&#39;s last piece for<br/>
his epic. Trak was the same way. We actually tried to do Trak last Saturday<br/>
but it went wrong. Someone cast something right when the bard died and Trak<br/>
spawned and he immediately killed all the casters. We melee didn&#39;t know it<br/>
at the time and managed to melee him down to Tra! He despawned while we were<br/>
doing CR. So I went back to bard watching. We planned to try him Monday<br/>
night first thing since he was up Sunday night late. Monday he wasn&#39;t up til<br/>
about 8 pm though but we had lots of folks on standby and pulled it together<br/>
fast. We applied what we learned from last time and wiped Trak out.  There<br/>
was a tense moment when people were dropping from poison, the clerics were<br/>
oom and I was poisoned and trying to loot the guts before I died! Someone<br/>
finally got me cured about the time the corpse opened up. <br/>
<br/>
The 2 things I think helped me the most in all this: helping lots of folks<br/>
so they were there to help me. Post on message boards so folks can know<br/>
ahead of time what&#39;s up. It takes lots of folks to do these mobs and that<br/>
can be a logistical nightmare. We have a public message board you can get to<br/>
from our website: www.venatorsapentia.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.venatorsapentia.com">http://www.venatorsapentia.com</a>&gt; .<br/>
We had awesome support from Shards of Avalon, Death Knights, Marauders of<br/>
the Dragon, Order of the Ebon Muffin, and of course my guild Venator<br/>
Sapentia, and a couple more folks in other assorted guilds. Our loot rules<br/>
for these things are the person calling for the raid for their epic piece<br/>
has unquestionable rights to that piece, other drops are lottoed. For<br/>
multiple folks, whoever is closest to completion has priority, with the<br/>
understanding you come back and help the next guy get his.<br/>
