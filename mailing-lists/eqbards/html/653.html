&gt; Greetings fellow Bards!<br/>
&gt;     As most of you already know, I have a living document on EQVault called<br/>
&gt; &quot;Bard Spell Analysis v1.4&quot;.  Since it was put up on that site, I have<br/>
&gt; received some good feeback, including corrections as well as some minor<br/>
&gt; additions.  I&#39;m up to v 1.6 that I will be sending it in Monday for posting. <br/>
&gt; If anyone has any information not in there already, I&#39;d appreciate if you<br/>
&gt; could drop me a line.<br/>
&gt;     Looking through some of the archives, I&#39;ve noticed that there is another<br/>
&gt; Bard song document?  Can someone forward me a copy?  I&#39;d like to merge that<br/>
&gt; information into what I have already (and give credit where it&#39;s due, of<br/>
&gt; course).<br/>

I know that the locations, levels and instruments are all accurate - but for<br/>
facts, well - some of my descriptions are rather colorful.<br/>
