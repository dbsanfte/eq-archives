<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539990229">I think the disagreement comes from the different backgrounds.  I&#39;m <br/>
sure AL heavily recruits the top raid classes (Warriors, Rogues, <br/>
Clerics).  When you can pick and choose what classes you want present <br/>
on a raid and there&#39;s only a certain number of people you want to <br/>
take, then Bards are not needed (after 1), nor missed.  Most guilds <br/>
are not in that position... the &quot;uber&quot; guild I went on a few raids <br/>
with (Yelinak, Dain, etc.) before I semi-retired didn&#39;t have 19 <br/>
Rogues to pick from, they kinda made use of whoever was available.  I <br/>
was in the group with the tanks taking damage.  I played Rondo + <br/>
Psalm with Puretone (and meleed til Epic proc).  When I was swapping <br/>
hotkeys around prior to one battle and accidentally burned Puretone, <br/>
the raid leader said, &quot;There goes ?k damage&quot; (I don&#39;t remember the <br/>
exact # - maybe 8k?).<br/>
<br/>
So, if you&#39;re in AL or FoH or the ultimate top dog guild on a server <br/>
who has access to whatever number of class/level player they want, <br/>
then Bards aren&#39;t needed.  But, if you&#39;re in a guild that will make <br/>
use out of you if you show up, then Bards can have a significant role <br/>
on the raid.  By significant, I mean doing something other than <br/>
buffing and watching or pumping mana during the whole fight.  I don&#39;t <br/>
claim that a Rogue in that spot wouldn&#39;t be better... just that we&#39;re <br/>
not completely worthless like some classes....<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does the VP Mage Staff block Rondo or Psalms?  If not, isn&#39;t <br/>
more DS always better??<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At the time I quit there were 4 bards in the guild: me, Thott, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jaco, Syren all 60 but me hehe.  As of a week ago, there was 1 bard, <br/>
Thott.  I quit, Syren moved and had no ISP for 4 months, and Jaco <br/>
quit because he was tired of being in the buff group.  So for 4 <br/>
months AL had 1 bard (Syren just came back this week).  If bards were <br/>
as needed as many think, would AL of all guilds only have 1 bard for <br/>
4 months and have accomplished what they have?<br/>
