<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bard armor (long boring ego-trip) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329913354">At 24th level I have found that I am pretty happy with my armor choices with<br/>
a few exceptions, I would like some advice on this if anyone has an opinion.<br/>
Here is what I have now:<br/>
<br/>
Banded Helm - not magic but I would hate to give up the 8AC points for the<br/>
much heavier blackened crown with less AC and the same silly half-elf<br/>
donut-looking graphic that I am tiring of.  I heard that Hatar (named low<br/>
20s sand giant in Oasis) drops a Fine Silk Turban with 10AC .1 weight and<br/>
+10 fire resist that does not have a texturemap on my character, which would<br/>
be cool if it is so, but I have never seen one to verify.  I would love a<br/>
crested helm for the looks and bonuses but I don&#39;t know where to find it or<br/>
how much they are<br/>
<br/>
Banded Mask - Dying to get the Guise of the deceiver, guess I should go to a<br/>
bazaar and hope for the best - can&#39;t go to lower guk yet at 24th<br/>
<br/>
Amulet of Thunder - this is a neck item I got from Drosco in the Qeynos<br/>
Sewers, has 2AC and +5CHA, I like the bonuses, replaced the Spiked Collar<br/>
(3AC +3STR) for it<br/>
<br/>
Bloodstained Mantle - best AC and magic bonus shoulder piece for some time<br/>
to come as far as I can tell within my ability to afford or obtain myself<br/>
<br/>
Banded Tunic - Once again the AC can&#39;t be beat for a reasonable price unless<br/>
I go to a medium bronze breastplate, and then the AC vs weight ratio seems<br/>
not worth the upgrade - steel is way out of my price range and obtaining<br/>
better items at my level is seemingly impossible unless I buy them - I am<br/>
not keen on the bloodstained tunic because again, same graphic as banded<br/>
with a reddish tint and less AC with magic bonuses that I am not all that<br/>
interested in as a bard - really want some kind of breastplate for a more<br/>
refined and respectable look.<br/>
<br/>
Barbed Arms - same AC as banded with magic bonuses, same graphic as banded<br/>
<br/>
Banded Bracers - Nice AC to weight ratio, not sure what would be better for<br/>
me at this time<br/>
<br/>
Elf-Hide gloves - love the bonuses, AC is decent, probably stick with these<br/>
as I am into RP and don&#39;t like the idea of myself playing a lute with metal<br/>
gauntlets - oh, and to me they are dark-elf-hide ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Purity Belt - wore a thick leather apron for a while and decided on the<br/>
purity belt, the AC bonuses are terrible comparatively but the stats on the<br/>
purity belt are nice, just waiting to get a trollhide belt which has higher<br/>
AC and same magic bonuses as the purity belt, but better increases<br/>
<br/>
Blackened Leggings - purely vanity, love the look of the black banded pants<br/>
on my half-elf, even though they are heavier and 1 AC less than Banded, only<br/>
thing I would trade them in on now would be Barbed Legplates if I could find<br/>
them because they are lighter, same AC as banded, and have AGI bonuses<br/>
<br/>
Banded boots -  just waiting for a chance to get some Dwarven work boots<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 Opalline earrings that I am proud to wear because I killed the mob<br/>
and looted them myself, a +5AGI ring and a +2INT ring (with base INT it<br/>
takes me forever to increase my skills)<br/>
<br/>
Sooo...I have the following balance stats with all this:<br/>
<br/>
STR 100<br/>
AGI 100<br/>
DEX 104 (with dragoon dirk equipped)<br/>
WIS 60 (base with no mods)<br/>
INT 77<br/>
CHA 105<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions from you masters out there for this level 24 fellow are very<br/>
welcome.  Anyone on E&#39;ci who wants to be my benefactor and twink me up is<br/>
even more welcome ;-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;So anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of armour I can<br/>
&gt; &gt;get that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives, or<br/>
&gt; &gt;somewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can even go<br/>
&gt; &gt;out and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income if cheap<br/>
&gt; &gt;isn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would suggest a bloodstained tunic, lizzie scale mantle and <br/>
&gt; cloack, and<br/>
&gt; blackend armor for the rest.  Looks great and if weight is an <br/>
&gt; issue it will<br/>
&gt; help alot. Yes the armor is NICE to have..I persoanlly wear a combo of<br/>
&gt; charred plate and bronze right now, but i have so many <br/>
&gt; strength enhancers it<br/>
&gt; isnt even funny! As a young bard the above items will be abit <br/>
&gt; above your<br/>
&gt; level for now..but well within the grasp of a rich bard..so <br/>
&gt; get your mage to<br/>
&gt; support you (LOL). Good luck to you Melaniel. May your songs be well<br/>
&gt; recieved!<br/>
