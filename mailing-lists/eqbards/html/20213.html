&gt; hell most likely.  Heck, I&#39;ll even try it from on top of the <br/>
&gt; merchant hut.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was going to suggest the hermit&#39;s house, but I think there are cracks in<br/>
the wall that allow AE to go through legit. You could also try it at the<br/>
centaur stables in SK. I am afraid to say it is possible to pull through the<br/>
stall wall from the outside with DDD and the fool Centaur will stand and<br/>
shoot arrows (instead of meleeing) for a while before coming through.<br/>
Exploit? mmmm, probably.<br/>
but your best test is in someplace like blackburrow or highpass Keep. Both<br/>
places with levels and where Selos works :o)<br/>
