<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655277117">BUT...<br/>
I am a 19th level Bard on Cazic-Thule. I have used many of the 1H<br/>
slashing weapons and have become very fond of my 2 combined longswords.<br/>
I was using the Mino Axe combo, but noticed that even though I did more<br/>
damage per hit,  I missed ALOT more than with my Combines. My question<br/>
is this: Until I get some of the higher level 1H slashing MAGIC weapons<br/>
(i.e. Demon Claw, Crys swords, etc.) I have been looking high and low<br/>
for the Combined Bastard sword.<br/>
    I was informed at one time that it was only sold at the gypsy camp<br/>
in Lavastorm MTNS, but I made a trip there today and they did not exists<br/>
there. (the swords, not the camp). I have also visited the gypsy camp in<br/>
Oasis and in one of the Karanas. Does anyone know of any other gypsy<br/>
camps, or more specifically, the gypsy camp that sells the Combined<br/>
Bastard sword?<br/>
