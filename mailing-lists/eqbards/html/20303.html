<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231904426">Sense Heading:  That goes for any character, not just rangers...  Perhaps<br/>
bard have a slightly higher int which would help a small amount.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you have the correct target?  What class doesn&#39;t have to do that?<br/>
<br/>
Snare:  Not exactly tough to do, when you get the snare breaks message, cast<br/>
it again.<br/>
<br/>
Hit Kick: Yup<br/>
<br/>
Taunt: Why would you hit taunt all the time?  It only works when the monster<br/>
is on someone else.  And again when it light up you hit it.  Very easy.<br/>
<br/>
Keep an eye on casters:  I do this more as a bard than my roomate does as a<br/>
warrior.  Why?  because he&#39;s the tank, I want to stay on the main monster,<br/>
let the extra mellees help the casters.<br/>
<br/>
No offense taken, but I can&#39;t disagree more with what you said.  My first<br/>
char was a warrior, who is the exact same thing, minus the snare...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hit Sense heading constantly to max skill<br/>
Make sure you have correct target<br/>
Make sure target stays snared (esp painful if there&#39;s a magician in the grou<br/>
**curses all magicians and their stupid earth pets**)<br/>
Hit Kick when button recycles<br/>
Hit Taunt whenever button recycles (unless there is a warrior in the group)<br/>
Keep an eye on the casters to make sure nothing jumps them.  If it does, run<br/>
over, taunt it away and stick-root it.<br/>
<br/>
No offense guys.  I&#39;ve played 3 bards over 20th level (beta, test and<br/>
release server) (Beta to 30, Test to 51, Release server to 46) and, yes, we<br/>
have a lot of button pushing to do.  But all other hybrids have it just as<br/>
bad, if not worse:</div>
