<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Level 6.5<br/>
&gt; Play time ~2 days<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m at 11 and two bubbles with a ridiculously long play time for my level<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Platinum: 40<br/>
 </span></blockquote>~12 pp<br/>
<br/>
It gets even sadder when I look at what I&#39;m wearing:<br/>
<br/>
no earrings<br/>
golden locket (gift from guild)<br/>
iron visor (guild)<br/>
patchwork scullcap<br/>
clawed knuckle ring (guild), other finger&#39;s empty<br/>
patchwork wristband<br/>
S ringmail bracelet (looted from a watchman)<br/>
S ringmail sleeves (watchman)<br/>
S ringmail gloves (watchman)<br/>
Dwarven ringmail tunic (guild)<br/>
wolf-hide belt<br/>
S raw-hide leggins<br/>
S ringmail boots (watchman)<br/>
FS dagger (watchmen)<br/>
Qeynos kite shield (guild)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Things to buy before I am satisfied (for now):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shiny Brass Shield<br/>
&gt; Bracer of Errolissi(sp, sorry)<br/>
&gt; small Bronze boots<br/>
&gt; Small bronze BP<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go on, rub salt in the wound!  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;d be happy with some strength jewelry,<br/>
but the +3 stuff I&#39;ve seen for sale had an asking price of ~30pp, which I<br/>
haven&#39;t got.  I have better gloves in the bank (black enameled something or<br/>
other ...I forget, another guild gift) and I think I&#39;ve got a better hat<br/>
too, but I can&#39;t wear them as I&#39;ve got only ~10 pounds to spare for loot<br/>
dressed as is.  So my new plan is to head to the swap and see if I can&#39;t<br/>
replace some of my items with netted/woven/mesh.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To sum up: this is outrageous.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I AGREE!!!  And you shoulda seen what I was wearing BEFORE cleaning up after<br/>
guard campers and getting twinked by my guildmistress!  I&#39;d get invited into<br/>
groups and hear &quot;First thing we need to do is get Ev&#39;s corpse&quot;.  Confused<br/>
newbies would see me playing a lute and comment &quot;I thought bards could wear<br/>
anything&quot;.  I&#39;d wander through the streets of Freeport and hear &quot;May I give<br/>
you some copper please?&quot; coming out my speakers!  On the other hand getting<br/>
free & unsolicited SoW&#39;s everytime I walked in or out of a city was kinda<br/>
nice. Heh.<br/>
<br/>
So uh, where is it I should take milk & muffins to and how much should I buy<br/>
FS weapons for again?<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
