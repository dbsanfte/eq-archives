<div id="ygrps-yiv-468358234">If my memory serves correctly, Niv&#39;s and SoS do not stack. It would be SO<br/>
great though!! =) I do like HoR and Niv&#39;s though in groups with no cleric.<br/>
In fact, I did sing just these two songs with 7string lute in solb the other<br/>
night. It was myself (52 bard), a 53 pal and 53 war. We took on LBs and<br/>
LDCs, sometimes two at a time, with little downtime, all things being<br/>
considered. With multiple pulls, I charmed when I had mana, and used Pixie<br/>
strike in other situations. Sometimes it was just more efficient to mez them<br/>
since LDCs were becoming more and more immune to my charm hehe =P  But on<br/>
single pulls, I wove HoR and Niv&#39;s without a doubt. Neither of the party<br/>
members realized how little health they lost against the LDCs, and when the<br/>
War lost a lot of hps it was due to the LDC&#39;s BB DoT. At which time, he&#39;d<br/>
back out for the healing songs without the damage being dealt to him along<br/>
with the Blood Boil.<br/>

P.S.  On a side note, has anyone ever felt the you were absolute unluckiest<br/>
person on your server? Never won rolls, never got into the best group, or<br/>
had the greatest combination of party members? ... I was shocked to say the<br/>
least, as would anyone be upon getting their first major BP. Yay now my top<br/>
matches, all in IP. Legs and boots still a mismatched disaster...<br/>

Sometime Sunday night we decided it was time for the majority of us to get<br/>
on out of the alternate plane. A friend gives me a /t. &quot;whatcha doin?  Nag<br/>
went down, he dropped CoF, burnt book half (or whatever), Heiro crook, CoF,<br/>
Wt red. box, and drums. I got my drums!<br/>
