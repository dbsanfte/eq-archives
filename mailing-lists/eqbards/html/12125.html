the shaman&#39;s puppy in the pool room of solB.  Twice (in a row, no less) I<br/>
switched targets from the pet to a kobold midintimidation (after pushing<br/>
button, before kick attempt) and landed the kick.  I was quite proud of<br/>
myself, to say the least.  Skill was 53 at the time of kicking.<br/>
<br/>
I was grouped with a warrior, shaman and SK for about 10 hours there<br/>
(early flight home for me), and made 3 bubbles worth of level 40<br/>
experience.  The place was nearly empty early in the morning, and the<br/>
pulls were fast and fierce.  My job was crowd control when multiple came<br/>
in, melee/buff/chain with just one, and mana/hymn between.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been starting to use binding again on a regular basis (when grouped<br/>
with ranger/druid), and I believe it grows in effectiveness with levels as<br/>
well.  It&#39;s still nothing compared to enchanter/shaman slowdowns, but came<br/>
in handy with pickup groups who wouldn&#39;t target just one mob.<br/>
