<b>Subject:</b> Re: A rant - but bard related - for the most part (About Halflings) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021056252">: I beg to differ, but I almost decided *not* to play a Bard when I found<br/>
out<br/>
: I couldn&#39;t be a Halfling.  This has been my biggest rant since day 1!  I&#39;m<br/>
: incredibly disappointed that NO little people or evil race can be a Bard.<br/>
: This should be fixed!!! Please?  *grins*<br/>
: When I asked about it, all I was told is that there were no CURRENT plans<br/>
: to change class/race limitations.<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree that Halflings should be able to be bards.  I think most<br/>
will agree that te whole fantasy idea of Halflings spawned from the Hobbits<br/>
of Middle-Earth, and what was it that Mr. Tolkien did every 6 pages in The<br/>
Hobbit?  He had Bilbo singing a song (ok so that&#39;s an exaggeration :) , but<br/>
Bilbo sure liked music (also shown in Lord of the Ring trilogy))  Oh, and<br/>
about Halflings being in tune with nature and whatnot... well, Hobbits<br/>
certainly didn&#39;t seem to like leaving their holes much.  Then of course,<br/>
Halflings were altered and reaccepted as a mischievous race, which is why<br/>
the Halfling Rogue is so popular, and this happened primarily because of TSR<br/>
if you ask me (as there aren&#39;t many other vastly influencial people or<br/>
things such as TSR and Tolkien).  And because I see no evidence of the<br/>
definition of the Halfling race in EQ it&#39;s safe to assume they are either<br/>
Middle-Earth-style or TSR-style, or a mix of both, in which case they are<br/>
fully suited to the bardic class :) (after all, rogues and bards are always<br/>
grouped together... perhaps Halfling bards are simply very rogue-like in<br/>
their nature :)<br/>
