fixed the disarm thing and my friends *want* to go to the<br/>
arena).  But I did play with it extensively around L24-26<br/>
against tidal lords.  DDD, CoD, and Hymn played with just a<br/>
horn was slightly worse than with my weapons (dirk and barbed<br/>
whip).  Played with a horn and lute it was slightly better<br/>
than my weapons.  This was against a single opponent of<br/>
course.  If there were multiple opponents, DDD and CoD were<br/>
far far better as long as Hymn could keep me alive long enough<br/>
to kill them all.<br/>
