<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143961711">I also got burned by the one lore item limitation.  I tried to buy two copies of<br/>
two songs in Kelthin and paid for all four but only ended up with one copy of<br/>
each.  I petitioned and was told, in essence, tough luck.  Thanks for the great<br/>
documentation Verant.  It appears that this has been corrected a little.  I put<br/>
a copy of a song in the bank and tried to purchase another copy and it would not<br/>
sell it to me.  Good work Verant.  I still want my platinum back.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know if I can buy a song that I have already scribed.  Has anyone tried<br/>
that?<br/>
