<div id="ygrps-yiv-619486124">I wonder if enchanters have the same problems with their enthrall series of<br/>
spells that we do with lullaby and pixie? When enchanters cast a mezmerize<br/>
on a high level mob and get a success message, do the mobs sometimes<br/>
continue to attack them?  I&#39;ve never heard one enchanter complain that this<br/>
was happening to them.  Based on what GZ says, you would think the rules for<br/>
bards and enchanters would be the same for enthrall spell series and<br/>
lullaby/pixie.<br/>

&gt; As most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are two<br/>
&gt; saving <br/>
&gt; throws that happen with an &quot;Enthrall&quot; style effect (such as Kelin&#39;s Lucid <br/>
&gt; Lullaby) hits a creature. The first saving throw is against the target&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Magic Resistance. The second saving throw only happens with high level <br/>
&gt; monsters - they get a secondary save based on their level. The reason for <br/>
&gt; this is that the Enthrall effect is very, very powerful - it allows a<br/>
&gt; single <br/>
&gt; player to remove a creature from combat. This means that a party that<br/>
&gt; could <br/>
&gt; handle two &quot;X&quot; level mobs might be able to take three, or even four of<br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; on if there is somebody around with the Enthrall effect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have a harder<br/>
&gt; time <br/>
&gt; being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can take out a single <br/>
&gt; opponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much harder, and by high <br/>
&gt; levels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a single player to remove one<br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; more creatures from combat at high levels is sick level powerful - to the <br/>
&gt; point that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The second saving throw does not send a message the environment - and that<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is something that is on our list of issues to address. There are, however,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; no bugs with the Song.<br/>
