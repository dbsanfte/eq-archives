<div id="ygrps-yiv-964247081">I think it was the Rogues list this came up on before ...<br/>
<br/>
Someone did tests through naked, PW/leather, Banded/Bronze.  They used<br/>
buffs to raise the AC in a lower armor to match thier unbuffed AC in a<br/>
higher armor.  <br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;d have person with AC X in leather with buffs, and then same<br/>
person with same AC X in bronze but unbuffed.  This was done with different<br/>
AC X&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The results posted of the most well designed tests indicated that the<br/>
protection factors are rolled into the AC.  The damage and damage pattern<br/>
was the same at AC X, regardless of what armor/spells got you to AC X.<br/>
This was true for more than one AC X.  Would anyone on this list care to<br/>
replicate the tests?<br/>
