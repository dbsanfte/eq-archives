I discussed this type of stuff at length with a bunch of<br/>
friends.  We saw four types of &quot;fixes&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
Absolute positive, relative positive - do it!  It helps<br/>
everyone, and hurts no one.<br/>
<br/>
Absolute positive, relative negative - iffy.  It&#39;s needed for<br/>
a better game, but would be perceived negatively by part or<br/>
all of the playerbase.  These are really tough to decide.  <br/>
Most nerfs fall into this category (at least in the opinion of<br/>
those doing the nerfing).<br/>
<br/>
Absolute negative, relative positive - generally a bad<br/>
idea.  It makes (some of) the players feel good, but costs the<br/>
overall game.<br/>
<br/>
Absolute negative, relative negative - dunno why you&#39;d want to<br/>
do this, unless you want to make the game harder.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with adding/removing things purely on the basis of<br/>
&quot;fun&quot; is that for the most part, it looks at only the relative<br/>
side of things (will the players be happier after the change<br/>
than before?).  Unfortunately, the prisoner&#39;s dilemma and<br/>
tragedy of the commons are very real, and thus create<br/>
situations where stuff that makes the players unhappy can be<br/>
better for the game.<br/>
