<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821539418"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have a RL lvl 35 Rogue friend who acquired a Mudwater Rune recently. <br/>
&gt; He can&#39;t recall offline if it&#39;s No Drop. I figure it is, being a quest<br/>
&gt; item, but thought I&#39;d ask. He didn&#39;t reply when I asked him casually if<br/>
&gt; he&#39;d get an Opoline Helm for me, too. *g*  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yep, it sure is NODROP.<br/>
<br/>
  There are reportedly several exploits to trade nodrop items.<br/>
  None of which I suggest you try.  8)   I have a mudwater rune<br/>
  as well, just never attempted to get a new opaline helm.<br/>
