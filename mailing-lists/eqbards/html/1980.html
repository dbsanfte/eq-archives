<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251196143">Interesting, I saw it go for 50pp last nite and thought that prety<br/>
reasonable.  I personally couldn&#39;t kill Dvinn without getting extremely<br/>
lucky in a big group.  Why would you want a barbed whip at 150pp if you<br/>
could get a dirk at even 50pp unless you just didn&#39;t use piercing weapons?<br/>

<br/>
And Dvinn is not the only source of the dirk.<br/>
<br/>
But why anyone thinks paying more than steel weapons prices for weapons that<br/>
are better than well balanced is a rip-off is beyond me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve seen it advertised from as low as 10pp to 100pp.  The big<br/>
&gt;difference between the dirk and other special weapons is that<br/>
&gt;the mob who carries it spawns often, and has it every time.<br/>
&gt;It is going to cause a serious realignment of prices for<br/>
&gt;weapons in the L15-25 range.  I personally wouldn&#39;t pay more<br/>
&gt;than about 15pp for one, maybe 20pp if I were in Qeynos and<br/>
&gt;needed another ASAP.  Any more than that and it&#39;d be more cost<br/>
&gt;effective for my friends and me to trek to Crushbone and get<br/>
&gt;another.<br/>
