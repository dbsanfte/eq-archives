I can get through MM just fine with the invis song or with camo. The problem<br/>
is when there are undead spawns in the castle. Those *can* see us. At night,<br/>
in the castle, the will sappers, and sorry can&#39;t remember all of the names<br/>
of them, are the undead version of the mobs we see during the day, the<br/>
ancilles, deathly ushers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So around the outside of the castle, the lake, the GY, you have no problems<br/>
because those are the guards and such, and always live creatures. Just try<br/>
not to enter at night, and hope there aren&#39;t any undead ones still inside :)<br/>

&gt;    Speaking of Clouding - it has been failing big time lately by Mobs that<br/>
&gt;are now green to me in Mistmoore.  When I was in my mid-to-upper 20&#39;s - I<br/>
&gt;could sing it and get from the zone to the Graveyard completely unmolested.<br/>
&gt;The Initiates and what have you that spawn along the way would never be a<br/>
&gt;problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Starting a couple weeks ago - they would go agro on me when singing<br/>
&gt;Clouding and when Regular (not Superior) Camouflage is cast on me.  This is<br/>
&gt;a major train generator.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    It seems to me they upgraded these mobs see invis.  Someone I grouped<br/>
&gt;with theorized that some wandering mob casts see invis on them - but who<br/>
&gt;knows?<br/>
