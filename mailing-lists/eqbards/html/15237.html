Warsong is self-only and probably the best song for the bard - definitely<br/>
the best if you are soloing and attacking with melee weapons.  If you can<br/>
play 3 songs and you are in the melee and have good weapons, i&#39;d say you<br/>
definitely should think about using it.  Even if you can only play 2 songs -<br/>
consider it.  Especially if you dont have celerity yet or are not haste<br/>
buffed.  A Flowing Black Silk Sash adds 20% atk speed.  You have &quot;one&quot; in<br/>
your song book - why not &quot;wear&quot; it?<br/>

&gt; Warsong is self-only so is rarely used at higher levels.  Also, I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; entirely sure it stacks with anything except Anthem... not sure though,<br/>
<br/>
&gt; never tested it.  After about level 20 I never had it memmed </span></blockquote></div>
