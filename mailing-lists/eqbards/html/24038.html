<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525267576">Get your fill of pulling while you can! Once you get clarity, the casters<br/>
will nail you down tight! You get to stand around and sing clarity while the<br/>
rangers, rogues, etc have all the fun. I haven&#39;t pulled in ages. I finally<br/>
got to pull a dragon in Western Wastes last weekend. I was so happy! The<br/>
first attempt saw the ranger eatten very quickly. He said it was keeping up<br/>
with him on SOW, so I got elected to fetch. BTW, I am fairly sure one of the<br/>
named dragons there sees through invis. Rak Something or other swatted me<br/>
out of the sky like a fly while I was looking for a corpse.<br/>

Xegony&#39;s full primetime population had been running around 2500, not 2000.<br/>

I&#39;m probably still anon or RP; I forget to change it back whenever we leave<br/>
the planes or HS. My wiz stays RP. I don&#39;t mind tping when I have time but I<br/>
don&#39;t want spammed by requests.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed wizards are scarce? Seemed like there were tons of<br/>
wizards in the beginning, but now all are necro, enc, or mage.<br/>
<br/>
My latest pet peeve: I&#39;m a wood elf. I&#39;m bound in Gfay so I can get reagents<br/>
for the cleric whenever I die. Everytime I get killed I get hammered for<br/>
TP&#39;s and sow&#39;s at the Gfay spires. where is it written all naked We&#39;s are<br/>
druids? I even had one person hound me for such even after I got rezzed back<br/>
into HS.<br/>
<br/>
30&#39;s dungeons: Kaesora til I remembered I needed my VS faction long enough<br/>
to do the Brain Bite quest; Droga which is goblins probably like Nurga.<br/>
<br/>
DDD is good for beating out ks&#39;ers on that first hit But given the much<br/>
greater usefulness of so many other songs, I never mem it. One I loose charm<br/>
it might have been an option If they hadn&#39;t reduced it&#39;s taunt factor. I<br/>
really haven&#39;t found much that will peel things off my cleric, especially<br/>
now. :(<br/>
