If you are serious Golias the simplest and best answer really is to talk to the enchanter about it, after all your going to draw most of the attention anway. However if you really don&#39;t feel like talking about it and just want to do it adjust your song list to take out DDD and do something like CD,Psalm (heat or cold),Hymn.  Ask the Enchanter to mez after the line of wince messages.  So far that&#39;s been the only way I&#39;ve been able to do it.  If there is an enchanter I usually either join the melee or use instruments to buff and heal<br/>

&gt; Damn straight!	Harmonic is one of the cornerstones of this fine list, and<br/>
&gt; deserving of a rant now and again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Besides, I think this kind of thing is good for us, to maybe drop a reality<br/>
&gt; check on the general frustrations associated with being a Bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, somebody help me to coordinate my All Instrument attack with my<br/>
&gt; enchanters AE Mez, before I have to beat him to death with my lute... :)<br/>
