<div id="ygrps-yiv-393290476">Seems monetary problems run rampant, so I will share with the list a <br/>
     recent experience of mine.<br/>
     <br/>
     Having more courage than sense, and more sense than time, I am a slow <br/>
     leveler.  I frequently &#39;waste&#39; levelling time in that fruitless thing <br/>
     we bards know as travelling.  Perhaps the largest impetus in my <br/>
     selection of this class was that accelerado song.  <br/>
     <br/>
     The other night I got the urge to visit Guk.  Being a wood elf bard, I <br/>
     knew that upon my arrival there, the inhabitents would view me <br/>
     indifferently as long as I did not attack anything, and I would be <br/>
     able to explore the dungeon in relative safety.  Sure enough, upon <br/>
     entrance, everything left me alone.  I strode confidently about the <br/>
     halls, gawking at the sights and actually watching a train or two pass <br/>
     me by with nary a hair falling out of my helm...<br/>
     <br/>
     Well, long story short, in my joy of exploration, I got quite <br/>
     thorougly lost.  For those who have never visited Guk, it is very <br/>
     mazelike, with thin passages that begin to run together after a time.  <br/>
     During this aimless wandering, I would come upon the bodies of fallen <br/>
     frogloks, sometimes quite high level, lieing prone on the floor.<br/>
     <br/>
     Being level 14, there was no chance I would have ever been able to <br/>
     defeat these beasts myself.  But these bodies were left by trains that <br/>
     destroyed or ran off the high levellers who were attempting to kill <br/>
     them for the exp and the loot.<br/>
     <br/>
     And with those people dead/long gone, I could loot the bodies of the <br/>
     fallen froglocks myself.<br/>
     <br/>
     If you enjoy exploration, are of good alignment, and don&#39;t mind <br/>
     getting lost, I recommend this diversion.  I made over 20 plat the <br/>
     night I wandered lost and aimless through the halls of guk, just from <br/>
     looting the corpses of the fallen out of the massive trains that <br/>
     accumulate in that dungeon.<br/>
     <br/>
     Just don&#39;t attack anything while your down there, or all of a sudden, <br/>
     you are lost AND in a threatening dungeon.  Thats not exactly good. <br/>
     ;-)<br/>
