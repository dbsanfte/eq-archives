<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688101930">That is a brilliant idea, and I honestly love it.  Those messages should be<br/>
in group say, not plain say imo.<br/>
<br/>
Verant will probably never do it.  They rightly feel that building the trust<br/>
amongst players is important.  You have to get to know others well enough to<br/>
group with them and trust them to tell you what loot is, which necessitates<br/>
long-term grouping relationships, which is a positive thing.  If you put<br/>
these messages in then you diminish the necessary trust relationships<br/>
between players and somewhat diminish to need for long-term relationships.<br/>
<br/>
But Verant continually surprises me both positively and negatively.<br/>

&gt; There was a thread I read earlier but I&#39;m not sure it<br/>
&gt; was on this list.  The jist of the thread was, to<br/>
&gt; prevent disputes about loot, when a corpse is looted<br/>
&gt; you would see the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PlayerX loots MobY&#39;s corpse<br/>
&gt; PlayerX sees a Black Pearl<br/>
&gt; PlayerX sees a Fine Steel Long Sword<br/>
&gt; PlayerX recieves 3pp 2gp 8sp 2cp<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This doesn&#39;t seem like it would be too hard to code<br/>
&gt; and would eliminate any dispute, assuming the person<br/>
&gt; doing the questioning was present at the time of the<br/>
&gt; looting.<br/>
