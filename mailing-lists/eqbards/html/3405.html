<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-153389627">Recently, I was grouped with a necro who asked me to sing Jaxan&#39;s while she<br/>
was meditating.  She claimed to notice a *big* difference.  Now, I&#39;ve seen<br/>
the discussions of how Jaxan&#39;s changes the meditation tick interval from<br/>
8 seconds to 6 seconds, thereby increasing mana regeneration as a side effect.<br/>
However, the druid I usually group with has said that she doesn&#39;t notice<br/>
any difference.<br/>
<br/>
To put the question to rest, we timed her mana regeneration with and without<br/>
Jaxan&#39;s.  It turns out that whether I was singing Jaxan&#39;s, the Hymn of<br/>
Restoration, or nothing at all, her meditation time was 45 seconds a bubble,<br/>
plus or minus 2 seconds, due to the inaccuracies in our measurements.<br/>
<br/>
So, it would seem that Jaxan&#39;s does nothing to improve meditation, as has<br/>
been previously reported.  Is this a bug/exploit that&#39;s been fixed recently?<br/>
Does anyone have any recent evidence to the contrary?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
