<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490401349">I had an absolutely wonderful time! It ended up that the king never moved me<br/>
therefore I didn&#39;t have to duel. But it was a blast! All of the data has been<br/>
put up on a website if you are interested in checking it out. I&#39;m going to<br/>
copy and paste the link into here, but I don&#39;t know if it will show up as a<br/>
link. I hope so :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi fellow bards!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I need some information assistance. We are having an event on my server,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Karana, on Saturday. We are having a chessmatch at the chessboard with<br/>
&gt; duels.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Different level players have been chosen for the role&#39;s of King, Queen,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bishop, Rooks and Pawns. I volunteered to be there because my guild has a<br/>
&gt; &gt; major role in the event. I am a Level 11 bard. I figured I would be asked<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; assist in the organization of the event. However, I have been chosen as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; PAWN! Could anyone advise me on the best strategy to employ to possibly<br/>
&gt; come<br/>
&gt; &gt; out of this alive? I know I am probably being vague as to some of the<br/>
&gt; rules of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game but that is because they are still being determined. I do know<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; charming will not be allowed. Only self-buffs will be allowed. DOT&#39;s are<br/>
&gt; &gt; allowed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am still in the process of figuring out how to be the best bard that I<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be and I have a lot to learn. So I look to each of you......the experts!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance you could give me!<br/>
