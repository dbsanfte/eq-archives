&gt; Just make double sure that NO ONE in a roll has &quot;said&quot; anything prior to the<br/>

<br/>
The only foolproof ways I&#39;ve seen (or at least haven&#39;t figured<br/>
out a way to cheat at :) are the two already mentioned:<br/>
<br/>
Using a random seed (leader does a /random 100 1000, say it<br/>
comes out 493, then everyone does a /random 1 493).<br/>
<br/>
Using a nearest-value.  Everyone does /random 1 100 first,<br/>
then the leader does a /random 1 100, and the number closest<br/>
to the leader&#39;s roll wins.  Yes, the leader could rig it, but<br/>
if the leader (who is usually the looter) is rigging it, I<br/>
figure you&#39;re not going to get the item anyway.<br/>
