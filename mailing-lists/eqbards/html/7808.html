<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248381341">So last night I&#39;m helping a 24th Paladin friend of mine (I&#39;m 25th) camp the<br/>
JBoots.  There are literally about 14 people in that little room waiting for<br/>
the spawns so it was quite safe.  We get to chatting to kill the Sand Giant<br/>
sized boredom of being in that little room for hours and hours and the subject<br/>
turns to duels.  I&#39;ve never been in a duel and was soon quite curious as to<br/>
whether or not I could beat this Pally so I challenge him.  Well right there<br/>
in Drelzna&#39;s throne room we start going at it.  I didn&#39;t have a chance to mem<br/>
songs just for the purpose of dueling, so what I&#39;m weaving is Anthem, Hymn and<br/>
Bellow - not a bad combo for being unprepared.  I&#39;m wielding Thulian Claws and<br/>
a Dragoon Dirk in magical/banded, while he&#39;s got himself a Silvery Two-Handed<br/>
War Axe and chain/plate mail.  Neither wants to die so we agree to go to one<br/>
bubble and stop.<br/>
<br/>
First of all that damn axe hit hard when it hit; he missed fairly often<br/>
(perhaps his 2HS was low, didn&#39;t ask).  Well he freaking blinded me several<br/>
times which sucked, but I just kept Bellowing at him while blind (pretty<br/>
effective since he couldn&#39;t leave range).  He tried to root me several times<br/>
and I resisted them all, but I was easily able to Chain him down when I felt<br/>
like it.  He got very lucky toward the end of the fight and hit me hard<br/>
several times in a row with the axe or I would have beaten him pretty handily,<br/>
but alas I was only about half a bubble higher than he was when we approached<br/>
the pre-defined one bubble mark.<br/>
<br/>
Then he hit Lay On Hands.  Ouch, hadn&#39;t thought about that one so he beat me<br/>
fair and square.  A few minutes later I asked if he wanted to try dueling<br/>
again.  He declined.<br/>
