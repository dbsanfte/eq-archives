<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841451391">Let me start this off by says &quot;no john, i have no clue how i got to lev 35<br/>
without knowing this - just killed _alot_ of wisps I guess...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, after being Miss Know-it-all on my last post, here goes:<br/>
<br/>
What is a &quot;tick&quot; (no not the kind some of you suspect lives in my greaves<br/>
&lt;g&gt;) I mean all this talk in song analysis about how long effects last.<br/>
What is a tick vs a pulse vs a round vs etc etc<br/>
<br/>
Example: in Rokken&#39;s re-write of the song analysis, on Chords it says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It has a duration of 3 ticks (a tick is 6 seconds) after you stop playing<br/>
it&quot; &lt;I think this should be total duration of 3 ticks ie: you see wince<br/>
message every 18 seconds or duration of 2 ticks after you stop playing it --<br/>
because it takes the first tick to start it and then if you immediately stop<br/>
it coasts for 2 more ticks - or is the damage a total of 4 tick altogether?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I presume it does some damage each &quot;tick&quot; and once started continues even if<br/>
you stop playing the song. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I would like to know which songs &quot;stack&quot; with each other.  Beyond<br/>
chant and anthem dont stack. Chant and purifying/elemental dont stack.<br/>
Lullaby doesnt seem to stack with anything nor does charm effetcively - at<br/>
least it seems to wear off really fast for me. <br/>
<br/>
Specifically, does Fulfils Curtailing NOT stack with any songs or other<br/>
spells other players cast.  In fact that would be also a good addition to an<br/>
analysis matrix - what spells are not compatible with various songs and vice<br/>
versa.  Ie: chains will break, root, snare and cancel darkness and the DoT;<br/>
invis will kill pets; pulse songs that kill others invis; bellow will break<br/>
a a mezzed mob, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I mean some of these things I know - but is there a definitive collection of<br/>
this knowledge?<br/>
<br/>
John, what can i say - lots of wisps and oh yeah lots and lots of fire<br/>
beetles!! &lt;s&gt;<br/>
