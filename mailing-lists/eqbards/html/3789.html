<div id="ygrps-yiv-516501820"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, this is were the grouping aspects of EQ take over.  Yes we have songs <br/>
&gt; that lower fire resist, also enchanters can lower resists as well (which is <br/>
&gt; why my bard loves grouping with enchanters, but that is another thread <br/>
&gt; &lt;grin&gt;).  This is not a solo&#39;ist game in the long run, esp if you want to go <br/>
&gt; into the dungeon depths.  The thing with Druids and Necros is that they are <br/>
&gt; so easy to solo up to high levels (30+) that the people who play them do not <br/>
&gt; get a chance to build grouped tactics.  So it is not so much that they are <br/>
&gt; difficult to play at higher levels, they are just suddenly forced to group <br/>
&gt; in the 30&#39;s and it can ge a bit harsh making the change that late in the <br/>
&gt; game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s bull. Sure, it may be true for some people, but most druids I know<br/>
(including myself) are constant groupers. Grouping is where the fun is at.<br/>
However, it&#39;s not fun to be decent at some things (DD and heal) for 30<br/>
levels, then suddenly have half your ability taken away (DDs resisted) and<br/>
your other main ability fade away slowly (no heals above greater heal).<br/>
Yes, you can still be very useful. But no longer can you be, to a group,<br/>
what you&#39;ve been for 30 levels (a nuker or healer as needed). That&#39;s a<br/>
hard change to make -- especially when Verant keeps waving in your face<br/>
&quot;you&#39;re the second/third best nukers in the game!&quot; but decline to mention<br/>
that&#39;s IF you&#39;re not resisted. <br/>
<br/>
Kind of like how they go &quot;you have the best root in the game! it roots AND<br/>
does damage!&quot; Sure.. at level 30, that 10dmg with a root is really worth<br/>
the extra 40% resists..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, getting pretty off topic here.. =)<br/>
