<div id="ygrps-yiv-57903680">Trains in Sol-B?? I have been there for about a week or 2 on and off now -<br/>
learning the place (I can find pool room, window room, nobel room and the<br/>
king room, I can prolly stumble into the bat rooms to but am not confident<br/>
looking in there.  Anyhow, our Sol-B is crowded as hell and a doggy&#39;s<br/>
(greater kobolds as they are affectionately known ;p) life is about 4<br/>
seconds.  There are pullers running through the place like mad.   It&#39;s like<br/>
HighKeep all over again &lt;sheesh&gt; spawn stealers, whiners, waiting lists for<br/>
rooms, etc. etc.  Trains are only very occasional.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that is during prime time playing hours! hehe - try going there first<br/>
thing Sunday morning.  Zone in and 3 GK&#39;s are guarding the foyer - ugh.  You<br/>
finally band together with who ever is in the outter hall and clear the<br/>
entry point.  Woo hoo this feels pretty cool. Think about how this place was<br/>
when the first wave of players arrived.  How&#39;d ya like to fight here in<br/>
banded armor?  Hehe - guess that an army of dwarfs were the first ones in<br/>
since they could get small bronze in Unrest.  (Medium bronze drops in Sol-B<br/>
and on a young server loads were prolly still in banded when the first wave<br/>
hit.)<br/>
