<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427568562">Harmonic is just another living being that is born to be a judge. There&#39;s<br/>
only one set of fix definition for ppl&#39;s preference and desire. Who are you<br/>
to say the word &quot;deserve&quot; ? Dont be arrogant and learn to understand/accept<br/>
other people&#39;s way of doing things. It&#39;s ok you think they dont deserve it<br/>
( I do respect your own opinion) but putting it out in the news list and<br/>
stepping on another ppl like you&#39;re high high above just because you dont<br/>
do it, is over esteemed of yourself.<br/>
Now that this message is doing the same thing like you did to Martyn. How<br/>
do you feel? Understand it yet? no? get a Stein Maggok +15 INT.<br/>
If you&#39;re opinion is not being constructive, keep it to yourself.<br/>
