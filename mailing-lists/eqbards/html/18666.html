<div id="ygrps-yiv-317968227">Hi Songer!  Welcome to the bard community.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately other than the MALE *cough* bards ability to dance while<br/>
playing a flute the only way we have of dancing is by useing creative<br/>
socialing<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;Dance&quot; is:  /dance /shiv /blee /point<br/>
Looks kind of 70&#39;s but at least it&#39;s not just jumping up and down on my<br/>
tiptoes :)<br/>
<br/>
Only males get the dance animation when playing a flute.  Us female bards<br/>
just stand there and blow on it while waggling our head back and forth.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] DANCE Anyone ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi Everyone ,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to this mailing list and have only recently<br/>
&gt; started to play a bard after my characters made it to<br/>
&gt; level 50.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started a newbie bard because I can remeber one day<br/>
&gt; while hunting SG&#39;s in Oasis - I saw a bard defeat a SG<br/>
&gt; without the SG laying a hand on him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This intrigued me as my 50 Ranger has to tank, kite<br/>
&gt; and use a lot of brain power to take down an SG and it<br/>
&gt; takes well over 10 minutes to kill one solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well - I do digress ( bard character is affecting me<br/>
&gt; already ) the question I wanted to ask was - DO WE<br/>
&gt; DANCE.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many people come up to me and ask me to dance because<br/>
&gt; they can see I am a bard ( flashing lights etc. ) I<br/>
&gt; then do a kind of dance that involves walking<br/>
&gt; backwards ( moonwalking type thing ) coupled with a<br/>
&gt; few other moves. But I really doubt if this is Bard<br/>
&gt; Dancing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have seen the anim of the Male bard that looks kind<br/>
&gt; of like a Pied Piper jumping on eggs when the male<br/>
&gt; bard plays the flute. I can only assume this is the<br/>
&gt; dancing that people are talking about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do we have another DANCE anim ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
