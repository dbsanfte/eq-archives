&gt; &gt; is implemented and you pull with a dot spell it will no <br/>
&gt; &gt; longer do damage because it will be chasing after you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then you stop, and it starts taking damage again.  The <br/>
&gt; &gt; increased duration makes up for the lost ticks of damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; during the pull.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s incorrect if we&#39;re all reading it correctly. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not being based on whether YOU the player are moving. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; being based on whether the mob is moving. So the argument<br/>
&gt; above stands. If you pull with a DOT spell and the mob<br/>
&gt; is running towards you - the DOT isn&#39;t doing any damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And again, long term damage is not as preferred to me as<br/>
&gt; damage done up front. I&#39;d prefer to have a lot of damage<br/>
&gt; in the beginning and end the fight faster rather than<br/>
&gt; the DOT lasting longer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
are you being intentionally dense?  If you stop, the mob <br/>
catches you and *TA-DA* STOPS!  So he starts taking<br/>
damage again.  How hard is this?  If you&#39;re going to end<br/>
up running for that long, and be that far away from the <br/>
mob when you reach your group/fight spot, don&#39;t pull with<br/>
a dot, pull with DD.  For short pulls you lose a couple<br/>
of ticks of damage if you continue to pull with it.  I have<br/>
a shaman, I usually pull with my dot, run to my fighting <br/>
spot (somewhere out of the usual mob paths) turn and<br/>
and get another cast in to slow the monster.  The only<br/>
adjustment I have to make is how I pull, now I just have<br/>
to slow it (drowsy for another level, then walking sleep)<br/>
then, when I reach my fighting spot, dot it.  The net effect<br/>
is the same, as drowsy last longer than the poison dot line.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for this &quot;I&#39;d prefer to have a lot of damage<br/>
 in the beginning and end the fight faster rather than<br/>
 the DOT lasting longer.&quot;, then don&#39;t use dot&#39;s, use<br/>
DD.<br/>
<br/>
I actually like the dot lasting until the end of the fight,<br/>
during a string of misses with a long delay 2hb weapon,<br/>
it&#39;s nice that the mob&#39;s health is still dropping.  For me,<br/>
the way I fight, the changes will result in an improvement<br/>
in performance.<br/>
<br/>
This all regards solo play, in a group the dynamics<br/>
are different, and I think I won&#39;t even notice.  (In<br/>
a decent group, even a poison dot doesn&#39;t always<br/>
reach the end before the mob drops) </span></blockquote></div>
