<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302121206">Miriana hits the nail right on the head - having a solid guild makes EQ fun<br/>
again because many of the details are non-issues: loot, trust, skill,<br/>
communication and leadership.  Be every so wary of the &quot;need 5 more people<br/>
to form guild, come to chat...&quot;, and especially be wary of joining a guild<br/>
because of a name.  Choose your guild based on how it meshes with your play<br/>
style and most importantly, with your &quot;EQ attitude&quot;! =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Miriana said:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The big difference between being guilded and not guilded is that I<br/>
can log onto Innoruuk right now and guildsay &quot;Vox is up, let&#39;s go&quot; and get<br/>
24 people with the right mix of classes to Permafrost in under an hour.<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t just the co-ordination once you get to permafrost, it&#39;s<br/>
the co-ordination of people to get them all in the same place at the same<br/>
time.  Without the channel for communication, a 24+ person event on the<br/>
same day is next to impossible.<br/>
	I would also be willing to /consent any person in my guild if<br/>
asked.  I am not willing to do so for the majority of non-LoD people on<br/>
the server.  Being in the same guild and working together with the same<br/>
people builds a sense of trust and teamwork.<br/>
