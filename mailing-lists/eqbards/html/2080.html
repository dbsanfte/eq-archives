<b>Subject:</b> Losing a level <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-664840374">Have to say this is one of the best lists that I have ever been on.  Seems<br/>
to me that most people here are actually adults.  :)  Anyway, enough patting<br/>
on the back, I have a quick question.  Just made level 16 last night hunting<br/>
in Crushbone.  I got a few more kills for insurance sake and set off to get<br/>
the Ayre.  Went to High Keep, got the song, scribed it, memorized it, and<br/>
went back to Faydwer.  My question is, what if I were to die enough to lose<br/>
a level?  Would I lose the song completely, just not be able to memorize it,<br/>
or what?  Haven&#39;t seen any discussion on this and was just wondering if<br/>
anyone has experienced this yet.<br/>
<br/>
If you are on Veeshan give me a tell and say hi.<br/>
