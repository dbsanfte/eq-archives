&gt; Well, maybe you are a bard that pumped most of their stats into<br/>
&gt; AGI and STA, instead of CHA like I and others did.  With 100 CHA,<br/>
&gt; my ability to solo is virtually NILL at level 13.  Sometimes even<br/>
&gt; blues give me a run for my money!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I put 25 points into chr and 5 into agi.  I didn&#39;t have much<br/>
of a problem soloing between 12-17 (which was back when I<br/>
refused to kite too).  Do you remember back around L5-10, how<br/>
everyone loved to attack goblins because they were wimps<br/>
relative to how they /conned?  Some mobs are just tougher, and<br/>
you have to find the wimpier ones.<br/>
<br/>
Between 12-15, I&#39;d say soloing was actually better than<br/>
grouping.  But the reason for that was server overcrowding.<br/>
There are so many people playing in party-safe zones (i.e.<br/>
ones without wandering insta-kill mobs, or the few safe spots<br/>
in zones with them) that it&#39;s difficult to avoid spending a<br/>
lot of time sitting on your butts while the fetcher tries to<br/>
find something to kill.  OTOH, playing solo, I could dodge the<br/>
hill giants and griffins in the Commonlands and hunt wisps and<br/>
the occasional undead and bear.  Make sure you twist<br/>
Restoration while you fight, and search for something else to<br/>
kill as you&#39;re healing up.<br/>
<br/>
At about 17, my friends and I started fighting in Highhold<br/>
Pass.  Sometimes there are a lot of jerks there, but many<br/>
times the people were pretty reasonable about taking turns.<br/>
The orcs came quickly enough that I&#39;d pick up a couple bubbles<br/>
every night I played there.  I have a friend who went from 17<br/>
to 20 in 4 nights at Highhold.  When I solo now, I usually<br/>
pick a risky blue, kite it near a zone, then fight it there.<br/>
After being forced to kite in the Ocean of Tears (red pirate<br/>
dropped on top of me, and you can&#39;t zone out of the OOT), I&#39;ve<br/>
experimented with it a bit more.  It is incredibly boring and<br/>
usually takes much much longer than if you just fought the<br/>
thing hand to hand and healed up afterwards.  But it&#39;s useful<br/>
for softening up something before the melee fight so that<br/>
you&#39;ll definitely win instead of the outcome being iffy.<br/>
<br/>
So there are just some level ranges where the available mobs<br/>
and spawn rate make soloing better, and some where grouping is<br/>
better.<br/>

&gt; &gt; the damage, but I sure can take it&quot;. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See my first point on placing mega stats into STA.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At 17-19, I&#39;ve found that a monk is pretty good at drawing the<br/>
monsters off me, as can a warrior with decent weapons.  A<br/>
rogue can do it if you give him a head start.  I still get<br/>
beat up pretty badly if there are multiple mobs, but I usually<br/>
have two clerics and a paladin in the group so I feel really<br/>
safe.  :-)  The impression I&#39;m getting is that the mob magnet<br/>
business is not as bad as it was when I was around L12-14.<br/>
