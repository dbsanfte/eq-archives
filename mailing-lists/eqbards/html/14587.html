<div id="ygrps-yiv-390471093">some of what you said was my point, Naggy is upgraded, Vox is upgraded,<br/>
Innoruk (he&#39;s the one with DT, right?) is upgraded.  They did this<br/>
because they were dying too easily.  This is all fine and good for<br/>
people who have been there before, and have plane/dragon equipment and<br/>
plane/dragon experience. (Actually its not, but at least you had a shot<br/>
at it)  By the time we get there, there will be no chance.  We will not<br/>
be lvl 50 before expansion, I cant imagine what Verant is going to do to<br/>
all those guys then...<br/>
<br/>
When I say these things, I&#39;m not trying to rail on the lvl 50&#39;s.  If I<br/>
hadn&#39;t left EQ from May till November, I&#39;d be a lvl 50 warrior with my<br/>
regular group from back then.  (They all hit lvl 50 in Sept I think).  I<br/>
just get annoyed when I see the future things I have been looking<br/>
forward to (dragons especially) being made untouchable to the slow<br/>
leveling people.  To be honest all the high levels being bored is<br/>
speeding my level progress right now, as they are often around to help<br/>
me when I do something stupid (like die deep in Befallen) and they (at<br/>
least for me) are often genrorous with equipment...<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
