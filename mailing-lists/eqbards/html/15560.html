<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756288171">I&#39;m sure I remember something about a charm song that &quot;works differently&quot; or<br/>
something like that.<br/>
Maybe my memory is just going :)<br/>

At one point GZ was asked about a &quot;mem-blur&quot; component of one of our songs<br/>
and he mentioned that &quot;they&quot; had been toying with the idea of having a<br/>
&#39;mem-blur&#39; song for us.  May this is what you were looking for?<br/>

&gt; &gt;I remember reading a while back (I think), not sure if it was here or<br/>
&gt; &gt;somewhere else a hint from GZ that we might be getting a new charm type<br/>

&gt; The reference was actually to a song that he thought we would like, and he<br/>
&gt; was anxious to see how we would adapt to it.  I think he was referring to<br/>
&gt; Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation.<br/>
