<div id="ygrps-yiv-484316260">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
There is a bug that happen some times when a mob died bye <br/>
a DOT, the caster of the DOT or the group he is in, doesn&#39;t <br/>
get the kill.<br/>
<br/>
So, i guess when he is alone or in a group he gets no xp,<br/>
and when someone else helps him or his group to kill the mob,<br/>
the one that helped him (them) get the kill.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I think, you get the kill from the shaman.<br/>

I think there is something messed up BIG time with the damage calculation<br/>
Verant is using for kills.<br/>
<br/>
The other night fighting Ogre bouncers, we had a group with a level 40<br/>
Paladin (GB and Shield), level 40 Warrior (EXE Axe), Level 37 Warrior (EXE<br/>
Axe), Me (43 Bard) (YK and Kisch), Level 40 Druid (Drones, DD), Level 45<br/>
Shaman (DoT, Heal).<br/>
<br/>
We were letting a level 43 ranger who was waiting for a group practice<br/>
piercing with 2 fine steel daggers on our pulls.  Low and behold, not once<br/>
but TWICE in a row she was able to steal the XP from all of us.<br/>
Theoretically that should be impossible and I cannot imagine how in ANY<br/>
fashion she could outdamage all 6 of us... especially the combo that we had.<br/>
Embarassed, she stop practicing on our MOBs after her two steals :-).<br/>
<br/>
So, in my opinion, the last option &quot;BUG&quot; is most applicable here.<br/>

&gt; All the chant series have been increased somewhat but I hadn&#39;t heard that<br/>
&gt; they were increased by THAT much....  interesting...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What was the Druid tossing in?  If it was careless lightning or something<br/>
&gt; more powerful that would explain it.  Druids have some pretty hefty DD<br/>
&gt; spells.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A couple of friends and I were in Steamfont killing Mino Lords the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; night, trying to get me out of 31 so they could bask in the glow of my<br/>
&gt; mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; song, when the strangest thing happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was with a level 36 Barbarian Shaman (with her pet) who was soloing,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was grouped with a level 30 Druid.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We figured that I would get exp faster if I grouped with the druid<br/>
instead<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the Shaman.  So she would solo a mino lord and then we would kill<br/>
one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; While she was soloing hers, I was chaining it to make it a little easier<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; her while we awaited our turn.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One time, I decided to give her a little extra help in the form of<br/>
&gt; Fulfil&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Curtailing Chant (level 30 song?) which provides the MR debuff along<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; small DOT (6 or 7 dmg per pulse).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So when the mino lord died, imagine my surprise when I got the exp for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill!!!  She had been dotting the heck out of it as well as bashing it,<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; her pet helping her, and whatever else a level 36 shaman can do.. hehe,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet my teensy tiny DOT somehow stole her kill!  Oh, and I wasn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipping a drum (it IS supposed to be a percussion song isn&#39;t it?).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, as I see it, there are a few possible explanations.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1.  She wasn&#39;t getting credit for her pet&#39;s damage.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.  The DOT on Fulfil&#39;s is much higher than suspected.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3.  The druid I was with (who was supposedly afk) threw in a few zaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4.  It&#39;s a bug<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any ideas?<br/>
