<div id="ygrps-yiv-90891158">I have noticed this happen on several occasions.  I think it&#39;s a quirk in<br/>
the AI, though it may be an intentional one.  When I was level 12 or so, a<br/>
friend and I were hunting earth elementals in Steamfont.  We had killed a<br/>
dozen of them or so, when all of a sudden ALL the earth elementals in the<br/>
zone came after us.  I died trying to save my friend, as invariably<br/>
happens.  In any case.  It&#39;s a neat feature, whether intended or not.  I<br/>
have seen it happen on other occasions as well, for example, hunting gnolls<br/>
in east karana.<br/>
