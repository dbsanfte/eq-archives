<div id="ygrps-yiv-61006248">I was trying to get an ashenwood spear last night in Najena and a couple<br/>
people and I were screwing around in the front lobby area.  I had fear<br/>
playing the whole time and I was seriously pissing everyone off.  -=)  It<br/>
was resisted a good bit, but when you do it over and over chances are one<br/>
will hit.  I will say that a LOT of songs are resisted 80 to 90 percent<br/>
nowadays for me (lv 34 still) by PCs and NPCs.  Now that warriors have a<br/>
high base magic resistance (Sendog&#39;s is 70 at lv 49) I&#39;m starting to think<br/>
they&#39;re the wave of the future.  I&#39;ve used the chain/fear combo a few times<br/>
and it&#39;s unreliable at best, but it&#39;s still a great combo.  Even if they do<br/>
the sit down bug they are still fighting their own fear, and it&#39;s difficult<br/>
to turn around and fight, or cast, since you end up moving again very<br/>
shortly.  As for pvp tactics against multiple people, best i can think of is<br/>
the dirge.  But really, anyway you cut it, 3 wizards gather around you and<br/>
cast on you, you&#39;re dead before you can get a song off.</div>
