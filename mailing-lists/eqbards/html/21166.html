<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229367347">Again you are talking about your playstyle vs. their playstyle.  They pay<br/>
$10 a month just like you they are allowed, as long as they aren&#39;t directly<br/>
interfering with your enjoyment of the game (notice I said DIRECTLY), to<br/>
play however they wish.<br/>
<br/>
It is neither correct nor incorrect to &quot;farm&quot; a repop.  The same arguement<br/>
was once used about Cazic and Rubicite.   The same arguement was once used<br/>
for quest armor and now I see that arguement being used for planar gear.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a badge of honor&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
No, to me it&#39;s just armor.  Good armor, to be sure, but I don&#39;t think anyone<br/>
is all that &#39;fabulous&#39; for having it,  nor did I think so when it was even<br/>
more rarely seen than it is now.  (That could be because I was in Fear, on<br/>
test, long before anyone broke it on a live server).  Either way it&#39;s one<br/>
way of playing the game vs. another.<br/>
<br/>
They have just as much right to enjoy the game the way they want to as you<br/>
do.  Criticizing others for how they have fun is just plain immature.<br/>

&gt; Its unbelievable how many times this arguement is used.  It seems to work<br/>
&gt; well for everything.  Does it matter if people are duplicating singing<br/>
steel<br/>
&gt; breastplates?  Does it hurt me in any way?  Does it matter if people are<br/>
&gt; exploiting monsters?  Does it hurt me in any way?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, yes and no.  Me, personally, I could care less.  I&#39;ve completely<br/>
moved<br/>
&gt; beyond planar armor, so I couldn&#39;t possibly care less what people are<br/>
doing<br/>
&gt; in the planes.  But does it effect people?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to argue yes it does.<br/>
&gt; For the majority of the players, EQ is a game designed 90% around items.<br/>
In<br/>
&gt; a game with no end like EQ, the main way to actually feel that you are<br/>
&gt; making progress is by acquiring items.  Argue whatever you like, EQ is an<br/>
&gt; item based game.  Maybe not for everyone, lots of people just like to<br/>
&gt; roleplay and have fun, but the vast majority of the population likes to<br/>
&gt; aquire items.  Just look at how many posts you see saying &quot;I just got item<br/>
&gt; XX&quot; with dozens of replies saying &quot;Wow, congrats!&quot;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with this, we all like to get shiney new<br/>
&gt; toys, its one of the things that makes the game fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, how do farmers affect us?  Well, to most, planar armor is a badge of<br/>
&gt; armor.  By wearing it, you&#39;re essentially saying &quot;I&#39;ve been to the planes,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve fought hard, look at what I&#39;ve accomplished.&quot;  To this day, planar<br/>
&gt; armor isn&#39;t exactly common, and wearing it sets you apart from the vast<br/>
&gt; majority of the EQ population.  It says in its own little way that you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; accomplished something different, maybe accomplished more than a lot of<br/>
&gt; people.  Planar armor can be worn with pride, knowing you paid the price<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; it many times over in blood.  People who can obtain this armor with<br/>
&gt; absolutely no effort, in effect, living off the hard work of others<br/>
cheapens<br/>
&gt; the value of it.  Suddenly it doesn&#39;t mean so much to be decked out with a<br/>
&gt; shiney new planar BP, when anyone can go in, and obtain the exact same<br/>
thing<br/>
&gt; by sitting on their asses for hours on end while a ranger pulls mobs one<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; a time as they pop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All this being said, this is how the planes are designed.  The fault lies<br/>
&gt; with Verant.<br/>

&gt; Why does it matter if people come in after your guild clears out fear?<br/>
Are<br/>
&gt; they hurting you in any way?<br/>
