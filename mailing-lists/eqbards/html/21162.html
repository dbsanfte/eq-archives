<br/>

&gt;to the SSoY that I think you&#39;ll have better total damage with this<br/>
&gt;combination than with the SSoY and any other weapon you currectly<br/>
&gt;have in your second hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But, as has been suggested, getting a better offhand weapon might be<br/>
&gt;the best solution long term.  Only problem, on Xegony, Sionatchies<br/>
&gt;Partisans are hard to come by.  I&#39;ve been looking for weeks and weeks<br/>
&gt;to no avail.<br/>

Yes a better off hand weapon is proberly one sollution. I have been thinking of<br/>
getting a second yak. My guild can help me there, but the thing is<br/>
Im not all that impressed with the yak the effects are resisted alot by many<br/>
mobs and I would for sure prefer a thing like the sioanitchie.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the advice you all. Knew I could count on you. This list is the<br/>
bestest *smile*!<br/>
<br/>
So I think I will keep the Ebon razor in primary hand and put the yak in my<br/>
secondary.<br/>
Then I will look for a good piercer or maybe a second yak to replace the Razor.<br/>
