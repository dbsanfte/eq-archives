<div id="ygrps-yiv-479565590"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No I stated that you said you needed AC because you were always getting<br/>
&gt; hit, and that Verant obviously doesn&#39;t take that view. Because the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enchanter<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can get mobbed just as badly, and has way less AC.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s still at the crux of my argument.  Enchanters get mobbed when they<br/>
intentionally attempt to affect all of the extra mobs AND they get resisted<br/>
by some/all of them.  Bards get hit between rounds when charming, and they<br/>
get hit until Pixie Strike decides to make it through both resistance checks<br/>
when trying to &quot;enthrall.&quot;  When using Pixie, they have a 3 second recast<br/>
time, and I generally have to Pixie more than once to stick it -- meaning<br/>
I&#39;m taking a beating.  Enchanters have the fast-casting Stun line to help<br/>
against those that resist the AE Mez (unless multiples resist, in which case<br/>
casting even a fast spell is often times futile).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Enchanters and Bards BOTH have tools to mitigate the need for AC. Frankly,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not asking that Enchanters be given more AC.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to imply that you thought Enchanters needed more AC<br/>
(although, I&#39;d be all for them getting more... I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have the<br/>
guts to do what I do as a bard without all that plate on me).  I was trying<br/>
to show that a bard takes a lot more damage due to (a) song &quot;casting&quot; time,<br/>
(b) game mechanics involved with buffing/regen songs and extra mobs, and (c)<br/>
resist rates.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To begin with, at least up to my level, we get enough Rune to absorb ONE<br/>
&gt; blow from<br/>
&gt; an enemy (perhaps two. Depending on its level relative to you) And if<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trying to cast mez, you&#39;re certainly not going to waste time Rune&#39;ing<br/>
&gt; yourself<br/>
&gt; first.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am used to seeing the enchanter cast Rune before combat; it gives them the<br/>
ability to cast a crowd control spell after a resisting mob turns to them.<br/>
Remember, unlike a bard who gets mobbed for just doing his normal thing, an<br/>
enchanter won&#39;t get mobbed until they intentionally provoke the crowd with<br/>
an AE Mez.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Secondly, Rune doesn&#39;t stop stunning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our songs are stopped by stuns, just as enchanters are.  I was referring to<br/>
normal hits.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And doens&#39;t allow you to cast while<br/>
&gt; being hit (People keep saying &quot;Cast this on the cleric so they cast<br/>
 </span></blockquote>through while<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; being mobbed. It doesn&#39;t work that way.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, when being mobbed, you&#39;re pretty much screwed.  The Rune would be<br/>
broken through before any spell could possibly be cast.  The bigger problem<br/>
though, is that at least one mob in that crowd is likely to stun you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At my level, rangers don&#39;t have SoW, Shamans can be hard to find, and I<br/>
 &gt; really do get into groups without druids sometime. And bard song is a LOT<br/>
 </span></blockquote>faster than SoW to begin<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with. Even at lower levels you can tell this difference.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use the term &quot;at my level&quot; because I&#39;m taking into consideration the level<br/>
of the dungeon from which the Singing Steel armor comes from.<br/>
Selo&#39;s is faster than SoW, yes.  But, SoW still allows you to outrun most<br/>
mobs.  If I&#39;m getting torn into by a group of mobs, I can&#39;t rely on being<br/>
able to start up Selo&#39;s.<br/>
As you said, the running speed only really matters if the party is fleeing,<br/>
though.<br/>
