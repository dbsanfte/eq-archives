<div id="ygrps-yiv-828373432">The staff is 9/33 (.272 ratio), and it procs a 48 DD spell that&#39;s rarely<br/>
resisted.  In my case (126 dex) it procs ALOT, i&#39;ve had fights where I got 4<br/>
or 5 procs in one fight.  Even without the proc, the weapon ranks up there<br/>
with a silvery war axe or ashenwood spear.  The only weapons you&#39;ll see<br/>
replacing these are alot harder to get.  (Tishan Orb, Crystalline Sword,<br/>
DragonBone Hammer, Runed Falchion, EBW, Ykesha, GP Koshig)<br/>
<br/>
As for the -9 CHA, I&#39;m always partied with a shaman or enchanter who can<br/>
buff CHA.  I notice a few more resists especially when I&#39;m not buffed, but I<br/>
wonder if it&#39;s really making that much of a difference or I&#39;m just being<br/>
more sensitive to it.  None the less, the shaman also makes CHA potions for<br/>
me when neither of them are around.  So usually my CHA&#39;s 100+<br/>
<br/>
I traded a pair of crafted gauntlets for it, probably the best trade I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten in game yet.<br/>

&gt;Well Met All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once again this is Chancez with a question about an item. Since I&#39;m such an<br/>
&gt;Item seeker. hehe =) Why is it on my server on Bristlebane I see soo many<br/>
&gt;high level bards using the Staff of Writhing. To my understand, the Staff<br/>
&gt;of Writhing lowers Charisma which is one of our primary stats and effects<br/>
&gt;the effectiveness of the songs. Is it really worth it to use it? It must do<br/>
&gt;awesome damage. Anyone please shed light on this for me.<br/>
