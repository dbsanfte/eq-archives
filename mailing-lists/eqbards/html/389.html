<div id="ygrps-yiv-137514066">9 is hard, but if your going to group, find a group of people who will work<br/>
as a team...... the funnest time i have ever had in the realms was with a<br/>
group, of (Gasp) Dark elves... we all worked together each person doing his<br/>
or her own job... my advice is to start forming groups your self instaed of<br/>
just joining them..... you might gewt a bunch of bad people in your groups,<br/>
but there will usually be one or two who play smart... remember these people<br/>
and then next time look them up and group again..... the biggest thing to<br/>
remember is every one in a group has a job... one person lures, one person<br/>
takes the damage etc.. etc..   and later on When you are higher levels you<br/>
are not going to have much choice but to fight in a large group. So build up<br/>
your team now...  the more you play with the same people the better you will<br/>
react in danger with each other...... GOD I love this game, hehe any way<br/>
sorry for the long post :)<br/>
