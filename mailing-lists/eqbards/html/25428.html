<div id="ygrps-yiv-458531408">It is a shame these songs don&#39;t exceed the haste cap. <br/>
At the ripe old age of 53 I am finding that stat<br/>
increasing songs don&#39;t help much -- with shammy buffs<br/>
and jewelry, the melee types in my guild are already<br/>
pretty much maxed out.  Shammy slowdowns and enchanter<br/>
speedups further reduce bardic effectiveness in a well<br/>
attended raid.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody tried soloing in Western Wastes?<br/>

&gt; Not sure if they could do the stackable haste spells<br/>
&gt; the way they<br/>
&gt; currently<br/>
&gt; work.  They might be working on it dont know.  But<br/>
&gt; currently 1 haste<br/>
&gt; spell/icon and one item is all that will stack (sure<br/>
&gt; you knew that, just<br/>
&gt; rambling).<br/>
