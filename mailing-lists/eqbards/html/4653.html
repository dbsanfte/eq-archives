&gt;Let me guess - you were just singing the Rhythm songs, right?<br/>
&gt;Try playing them with a drum.  Up til about level 17 I&#39;d say<br/>
&gt;their use is minor.  At 17 you get Guardian Rhythms which<br/>
&gt;stacks with the other two Rhythm songs (those two don&#39;t stack<br/>
&gt;with each other).  With a drum and playing Guardian and<br/>
&gt;Elemental Rhythms, you should be able to get your party&#39;s<br/>
&gt;magic resist up over 75.  If a caster buffs everyone with<br/>
&gt;Endure Magic, that should be close to 100.  *Nobody* can raise<br/>
&gt;magic resist like a bard can.  As far as I know, the best<br/>
&gt;Endure Magic spell only increases it by 30 points.  At level<br/>
&gt;29 with a battle drum, I can raise it by close to 80 points.<br/>

alternate guardian and mystic shield with the drums i get my own mr over 190. <br/>
