&gt; I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players <br/>
&gt; because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our <br/>
&gt; behinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out <br/>
&gt; in part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford <br/>
&gt; buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that <br/>
&gt; until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces <br/>
&gt; (or complete sets) of plate armor. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess it&#39;s all a matter of perspective. I read the above and can&#39;t<br/>
help thinking you don&#39;t know how easy you had it. When I was starting<br/>
out, no one on our server was making banded until I was L16. I already<br/>
had a partial set of store bought chain when the first pieces of banded<br/>
started coming out of the first smith&#39;s forge but at L10 I was still in<br/>
leather. And the first banded was expensive. Larger pieces weren&#39;t even<br/>
sold for the first few weeks of production, they were only available if<br/>
you had store bought chain to trade in on it. (yes the first smith on<br/>
our server made a fortune) So in a way, I guess I consider characters<br/>
who can afford full banded at L10 and full bronze before L20 to be<br/>
twinks as well, not twinked by people, but twinked by the badly designed<br/>
economy that has made banded sell for barely over the cost of production<br/>
and bronze sell for a slight premium over banded, pushing the price of<br/>
banded even lower.<br/>
