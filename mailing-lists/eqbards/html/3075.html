<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061303319">Ahh yes, one of the finer things about this game &lt;eg&gt; revenge!<br/>
<br/>
Last night - our little group (13 & 2 14&#39;s) took down the scarecrows in west<br/>
karana &lt;muhahha&gt;  It was great to hit on red cons and win!  Good xp too!<br/>
These seemed easy even as we took them one at a time - would not like 2 or 3<br/>
at once though. <br/>
<br/>
But they used to terrorize us and now we whine that they are not tuff enough<br/>
