knocks you out of your song, going unconcious should<br/>
definitely knock you out of your song.  But in your case it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have made a difference since bard song effects last<br/>
for two pulses after you stop singing.  You would&#39;ve been<br/>
knocked unconscious, the next pulse would&#39;ve revived you, and<br/>
you would&#39;ve zoned safely.  In a (rare) situation like Roop,<br/>
where the song and poison battle it out for several pulses,<br/>
that IMHO should be /bugged.<br/>
<br/>
Another benefit you may not realize about the song is that it<br/>
stops bleeding.  When you&#39;re knocked unconcious, you usually<br/>
get a message that you are bleeding to death.  Unless someone<br/>
heals you or bandages you, you will continue to lose hp and<br/>
die even if the monster whacking on you is killed before it<br/>
can hit you again.  Yet another reason to have a bard in the<br/>
party.  :-)  I carry bandages as well for the rare occasions<br/>
where this happens to someone not in my party (lesson learned<br/>
after I saved an unconcious person from a monster, then could<br/>
do nothing but watch as he bled to death).  Saved someone&#39;s<br/>
life with them just today.<br/>
