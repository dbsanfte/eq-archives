<div id="ygrps-yiv-358187516">OK, I know I&#39;m a little late on this (I was on vacation out of town all last <br/>
week) but I wanted to throw in my 2cp and mention a few things as well...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;CPU:  Pentium III, 500Mhz<br/>
&gt;RAM:  128mb<br/>
&gt;Video Card (and RAM): Leadtek Winfast GeForce2 GTS, 32mb<br/>
&gt;Video Resolution: 800x600 (would use 1024x768 but the icons are too small)<br/>
&gt;Sound Card:  Sound Blaster Live Value<br/>
&gt;HD speed (rpm): No idea, but it&#39;s 13gb so probably 5400?<br/>
&gt;&#39;Net speed:  768k down, 396k up DSL, 56k modem as backup (connects at 44)<br/>
&gt;Geographic Location: Chicago, IL<br/>
&gt;Options enabled or disabled:        Sky texturing: Double-layer<br/>
&gt;        Particle Effects: Low usually just so I can see what I&#39;m doing<br/>
&gt;        Mip Mapping:  Off<br/>
&gt;Clip plane distance:  Mostly Max, reduce to 75% in case of need (rare)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How many songs can you twist?  3, once I surprised myself by accidentally <br/>
&gt;twisting 4<br/>
&gt;Do you slow down when it rains?  Never has<br/>
&gt;How about in Unrest or Kunark?  Some Kunark zones with way too many trees, <br/>
&gt;but not many<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have recently upgraded my video card to a GeForce2 GTS from a Voodoo3 <br/>
3000.  The Voodoo3 was fine except some spell effects would lag me down, <br/>
most notably the AOE rain type spells.  So I upgraded.  The visual quality <br/>
on the GeForce2 isn&#39;t quite as good; the ground ahead gets kind of grainy <br/>
and/or swimmy and in general things in the distance don&#39;t look as good, but <br/>
I don&#39;t get graphical lag at all any more.<br/>
<br/>
I also sometimes get Fatal Error 0E in VXD VMM sometimes leaving EQ or when <br/>
I get bonked to the server selection screen when zoning.  My MB BIOS is <br/>
current (the BIOS date was only a week old when I got the new MB last month) <br/>
but it is a VIA KX133 Asus MB.  I have been trying various options of <br/>
settings and everything but was wondering if anyone else had similar <br/>
problems that they fixed or any other visual quality tweeks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try to get my guild to raid Kaesora soon; it&#39;s the only coin I <br/>
need yet for the Nostrolo Tambourine.  If only somone would produce a map of <br/>
that zone that&#39;s not so confusing and looks better.. hehe<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I recently (ok, a couple of weeks ago) got my hand on Soinachie&#39;s <br/>
Partisan during a guild attempt to get our wizzies the Brain Bite spell in <br/>
Karnors.  What a sweet weapon!  And it looks unique, unlike so many other <br/>
bard-only weapons...   Yeah, I like to swing weapons a lot just because I&#39;m <br/>
too lazy to keep switching instruments.  =8^)  Most of the time I&#39;m my <br/>
regular group&#39;s closest thing to a tank...  Plus I have to hit arena and <br/>
practice my brass skills again... hehe<br/>
<br/>
OK, enough babbling (you know how we bards can get)...<br/>
