<div id="ygrps-yiv-347449395"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hmm, the only note I saw was about fixing mobs teleporting<br/>
&gt; away when fleeing from you.  This is a big problem with the<br/>
&gt; Hill Giants in Rathe.  None of the Mistmoore pathing problems<br/>
&gt; I know of are caused by this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just this wekeend I experienced this in Gorge and E karana.  In gorge,<br/>
my group was actually cooperating with some other people in the area<br/>
(what a crazy idea, eh?).  Basically my group of three (lvl 16 war,<br/>
cleric, wiz) and a 17 sk (solo) and a 16 druid (solo) were all pulling<br/>
to the Runnyeye zone.  It was a good relationship, our war would pull<br/>
extra mobs of the druid, she would give him the damage shield/sow.  I<br/>
ended up having to root occasional runners for the sk because of the<br/>
teleoprting problem.  (At first I dont think he wanted to ask for a<br/>
root, normally he was just paying me for occasional heals, 1PP for<br/>
&quot;Healing&quot;, 1PP for center/holy armor, but after 10 minutes of watching<br/>
him chase, come back, chase, come back, I figured out what was going on<br/>
and told him just to give me a message when he needed a root.<br/>

&gt; In MM, the main problem is that mobs don&#39;t take a straight<br/>
&gt; line route to get to you.  Anything you pull from or in front<br/>
&gt; of the ballroom runs through the ballroom, out the back,<br/>
&gt; through the negotiator room, and then towards you.  On the<br/>
&gt; way, it picks up all the mobs in the ballroom, the negotiator<br/>
&gt; room, and the gargoyles in between.  (There are other pathing<br/>
&gt; problems, but this is the big one.  Second would have to be<br/>
&gt; that annoying mob which immediately runs for the castle when<br/>
&gt; it sees you - doesn&#39;t even bother to attack.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Theres a froglok in Guk that would do this.  He&#39;d see our warrior, and<br/>
take off (never having been attacked) for the well room.  I think our<br/>
warrior figured out to sit down, and call for one of the casters to come<br/>
root it when he saw it...<br/>
