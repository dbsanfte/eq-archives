<div id="ygrps-yiv-720648027">yes i think we are excellent in a normal group, especially with no enchanter<br/>
or shaman.  our problem is that the higher we level, the less power we gain<br/>
comapred to other classes, hell the more power we lose (fear, mes, charm all<br/>
gone).  there are so many things other classes gain for hitting level 60,<br/>
things that make them so much more useful a class.  it&#39;s like there is<br/>
nothing to look forward to for a bard at 60.  i&#39;m 1 bubb from 59.  i hit 58<br/>
over 3 months ago.  i have said many times, as Elwyn has pointed out hehe,<br/>
that such and such level is my last.  i will say the same thing for 59, but<br/>
i SWEAR i can never see myself hitting 60. not only because there is little<br/>
to gain, but because i play so much less than i used to, and when i do i am<br/>
on a raid losing exp, not in a group gaining exp.<br/>
