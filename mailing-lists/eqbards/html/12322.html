<div id="ygrps-yiv-572575876">All of the GM&#39;s on my server have acknowledged that spite golems (and pets)<br/>
are bugged.<br/>
These are the single largest problem to overcome when making the zone<br/>
&quot;safe&quot;.<br/>
Generally, if we kill any spite golem, and haven&#39;t seen the pet, everyone<br/>
immediately camps out afterwards to clear the aggro list.<br/>
I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get around to fixing this in a few months.<br/>

same here.  a few weeks ago the consensus was to stop playing songs when<br/>
pulling, but i was in hate for 15 hours last week (finally killed Inno for<br/>
first time on our server) and i specifically asked if i needed to worry<br/>
about playing songs during pulls.  everyone said no.  i was not in the<br/>
pullers group, as you said.  the one thing that trained us badly was a stuck<br/>
golem pet, kept aggro&#39;ing all kinds of stuff.  if you see a golem come with<br/>
no pet, not good.  finally got arms though, which suck compared to mithril<br/>
but full imbrued looks pretty cool.<br/>
