 </span></blockquote>DOH!  Pardon me.  A thousand pardons even.  I confused you with someone else<br/>
apparently.  SOMEONE out there said &quot;admit it, trade skills are not part of<br/>
the fun&quot;  And somehow I got it in my head that it was you.   Don&#39;t I feel<br/>
sheepish?  That will teach me to type on too little caffine.  Can you<br/>
forgive me?</div>
