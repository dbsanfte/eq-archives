<div id="ygrps-yiv-219883381">Afraid not. She was pretty busy. I think her guild may have been out there <br/>
and she just ported back to make a little money and was headed back. Was <br/>
busy with our conversations as well at the time, so I didn&#39;t press the <br/>
issue. I&#39;ll keep my ear out, but since I haven&#39;t bought Velious (ie. <br/>
married, whose wife&#39;s highest character is level 26) others will have that <br/>
info well before I get it. :-P<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A druid sold me this song last night (I guess they opened up Velious<br/>
&gt; &gt; around<br/>
&gt; &gt; midnight or so).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Definitely requires string, and it gives a buff shield (looks the same as<br/>
&gt; &gt; an enchanter&#39;s clarity symbol). No quantitative info beyond that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; afraid. Would be interesting to find out more stats about it since it does<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; heal/stamina/clarity, but this would mean more weaving during downtime<br/>
&gt; &gt; since we can weave this with our clarity song.<br/>
