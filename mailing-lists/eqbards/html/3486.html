&gt;Well I was fooling around, and I got rooted in a dungeon(selo&#39;s doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;work, but can still break root), and the selo&#39;s did not break the root.<br/>
&gt;I forgot to try chain, as I didn&#39;t have it memmed at the moment.<br/>

that I know of.  Kept trying in in Split Paw when Ren Rex would<br/>
root me or a party mate.</div>
