<div id="ygrps-yiv-948494996">I have to disagree with you Harmonic.  I have been on 8 dragon runs since <br/>
turning 40 (4 in 40th lvl).  I have not died in one since the 3rd one.  With <br/>
Elemental & Guardian rythmns up I rarely ever get feared, as a matter of <br/>
fact the last time I was feared was on my 3rd 40th lvl raid. With resist <br/>
buffs & my dragon jewery kit I take minimal damage from the breath weapons.<br/>
<br/>
One secret I have learned is not to attack while twisting.  By doing this I <br/>
rarely, if ever, get clawed and my group stays very much alive.  Matter of <br/>
fact in one failed run, I was the LAST person standing at that point old <br/>
Naga-pus decicded he wanted a bard snack :)<br/>
<br/>
My system is nearly identical to yours, what I do to weave is I count to 5 <br/>
then change songa.  This has worked very well for me in keeping both up.  On <br/>
a normal dragon run with buffs, dragon kit, & songs my CR/HR is 200+, this <br/>
makes a huge difference.</div>
