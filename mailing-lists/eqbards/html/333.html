<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906381084">I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say that Verant has been incompetent.<br/>
That would be too harsh.  But personally (and those are the only<br/>
feelings that I am able to express!) I am somewhat disappointed<br/>
with Verant and the way it has handled certain issues.<br/>
The whole probelm with the login/chat server?  Isn&#39;t that the sort<br/>
of thing a beta is for?<br/>
Router problems?  OK, maybe UUNet is 100% responsible, but I really<br/>
do doubt it.  Again, the beta is when you test server loads and the<br/>
like (to Verant&#39;s credit, they did give us an extra two weeks to<br/>
make up for it).<br/>
But it is the little things that annoy.  Customer service.  Going<br/>
overboard on things like &#39;exploits&#39;, to the point where nobody knows<br/>
what an exploit is.  Annoying little (and not so little) bugs<br/>
that, once again, should reasonably been taken care of in the beta<br/>
phases IMHO.  The lack of GM support during &#39;odd&#39; hours.<br/>
<br/>
I apologise to those of you who are annoyed that this post (and<br/>
related posts) are not strictly on-topic for this mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know of a list that is related to technical aspects<br/>
of the game?<br/>
