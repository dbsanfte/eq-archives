<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250993522">I mean if us American&#39;s can&#39;t figure out which darn holes to punch in a <br/>
ballot card (even a person with a doctorate was quoted as saying that it <br/>
was confusing) then how can we expect Verant to always get things right. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, they are based in San Diego. Surfing programmers? Guards should be <br/>
responding to our hails with, &quot;What&#39;s up dude? The waves are looking fine <br/>
my man!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just glad that it was detected and fixed before it went live. I&#39;d give <br/>
them more credit had they found and detected the bug themselves, but then <br/>
again, we never hear about those.<br/>

&gt; &gt;apparently it was caused by some other code they introduced and was<br/>
&gt;unintended.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And this differs from 90% of our other song nerfs how? ;)<br/>
