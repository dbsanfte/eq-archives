<div id="ygrps-yiv-475941467">Had a bad situation last night in the ghost room in Unrest.  Want to run it<br/>
by everyone to get your opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
I was in the ghost room in Unrest late last night.  There were only two<br/>
groups in the entire zone.  Party consisted of me (29 bard), a 35 bard, 30<br/>
cleric, 30 shaman, 32 warrior and a 31 druid.  I had been in the group for<br/>
about an hour and the group itself had been in the ghost room for a long<br/>
time with no problems.  Five minutes after the warrior camped for the night,<br/>
the ghost spawned.  With no true tank to dish out melee damage, we had to<br/>
rely on the casters to do the bulk of the damage.  We slowly whittled the<br/>
ghost down to less than 50% health.  Everyone except the druid was still<br/>
over 75% health.  Ghost was attacking the druid so she couldnt get an<br/>
ensnare off.  Both myself and the other bard tried chaining the ghost but<br/>
neither of us could get it to stick.  All three casters were OOM when the<br/>
ghost started fleeing (around 25% health).  The two bards chased him, still<br/>
trying to chain with no success.  The casters medded so they could get<br/>
another nuke off.  The ghost got to the hallway and of course activated a<br/>
hag and a GDB near the lava pit.  Everything went downhill from there and<br/>
four of us died.  Druid was only caster able to gate out.  <br/>
<br/>
I was bound in GFAY.  Before I could finish memming my songs, the group<br/>
leader (the shaman) said he had to leave so he could complete one of the<br/>
shaman armor quests.  Everyone told him to hold off until we all got our<br/>
corpses back.  He said that he had to hurry because he didn&#39;t have much<br/>
time.  I asked him why he was in such a hurry when he could complete the<br/>
quest at any time.  He never responded and disbanded the group.  The druid<br/>
was a friend of his and they teleported out.  I sent him a /tell saying that<br/>
it was very bad etiquette to disband the group before everyone could get<br/>
their corpse back.  He blew me off.  <br/>
<br/>
The cleric gave me a res and then an invis to undead.  The cleric had<br/>
already gotten his corpse and was only sticking around to res me and give me<br/>
an invis to undead.  He camped so I had to get my corpse by myself.  My<br/>
corpse was by the lava pit.  I got to it and started to pull my corpse to<br/>
the zone when my invis wore off.  A werebat in the pit saw me and that ended<br/>
up pulling the entire pit on top of me.  I got attacked by the werebat, a<br/>
hag, skeletal monk and a GDB and ended up dying before I could get to the<br/>
top of the staircase.  Sure wished fear song would have kicked in.  <br/>
<br/>
I was really pissed at this point.  Sent the shaman a nasty message telling<br/>
him that I had died again and that he was totally uncool for disbanding the<br/>
party.  Once again he blew me off.  To say the least I will never ever group<br/>
with him again.  <br/>
<br/>
Was wondering what the general consensus is with you guys on the shaman&#39;s<br/>
behavior.  In every group I have been in so far everyone stuck around until<br/>
everyone got their corpse back, especially the group leader.  I was totally<br/>
appalled by the shaman&#39;s behavior.  This was far and away the maddest I have<br/>
been since I have been playing.  It was also the first time I have ever<br/>
gotten into a /tell argument with someone over any issue.  Anyone who has<br/>
ever grouped with me can tell you that I can get along with just about<br/>
anybody.  This guy pushed me beyond my limits though.  Was I out of line for<br/>
expecting the group leader to stick around?    <br/>
