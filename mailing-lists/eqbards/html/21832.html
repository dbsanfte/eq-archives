<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865478321">Rangers got told they wouldn&#39;t get improvements to defensive skills on<br/>
numerous occasions.  Case closed end of discussion.  Ranger rants continued<br/>
on Whineplay anyway.  Verant has since backed down on that decision.  So it<br/>
wasn&#39;t a waste of their time because they got what they wanted in the end.<br/>
Bards could be in a similar situation if we continue to raise the issues on<br/>
Whineplay.  Question is does anyone feel like fighting the battle anymore.<br/>
The mood I&#39;m getting is that a lot of bards are saying screw it and either<br/>
switching classes or quitting the game.<br/>

why isn&#39;t working as intended a valid response?  that&#39;s like going to an<br/>
amusement park, riding a roller coaster and saying, well my idea of a roller<br/>
coaster is different, it should have 2 more corkscrews and a loop and<br/>
expecting<br/>
the amusement park to reconstruct it to match your specifications.  if you<br/>
don&#39;t like it, ride another ride (try another class) or if you really don&#39;t<br/>
like it, <br/>
don&#39;t go to the park anymore (cancel your account).  but either way, it&#39;s a<br/>
waste<br/>
of time and energy to keep ranting about it afterwards.<br/>
