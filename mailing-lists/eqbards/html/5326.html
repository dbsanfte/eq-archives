<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249415687">We never take the group into the Keep, we always stay at the front on the<br/>
wall side of the moat. Our best puller then works his way into the place<br/>
pulling 2 to 3  frogs at a time till we clear the place. Then we pull the<br/>
Priest for the Leggings, or the Crusader. This is an amazing place for XP<br/>
though. I made 7 bubbles there and went from 36 to 38 one Saturday.<br/>

&gt; Oh man he is a badass, hits for dbl 120&#39;s and is really fast. We fought<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; twice along with 2 or 3 Zols. All he dropped those times was the Tunic.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the info we were going to ignore him from now on because the<br/>
&gt; Mithril tunic just wasnt that good.<br/>
<br/>
Yup, and he can lay hands on himself a couple of times in the fight to<br/>
boot. Our then L35 group died quite nastily in the bottom of that tower<br/>
a few times to him. The falchion is another one of those real rare drops<br/>
Verant loves so much. :(<br/>
