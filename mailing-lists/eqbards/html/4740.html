<div id="ygrps-yiv-262795737"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 5b. If you&#39;re in a group with another Bard and you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; dueling, will their songs affect you during the duel?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re grouped, then only bellow will work.<br/>
&gt; Most of the bard songs are either non-party only<br/>
&gt; or party only.  So you probably don&#39;t want to due<br/>
&gt; another bard until you disband.  On a side note,<br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re in a duel, you may not heal/buff other<br/>
&gt; people in your group either (unless one of<br/>
&gt; them is dueling you) until the duel is over.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My question was misleading, my apologies. I meant - if you are dueling<br/>
someone NOT in your group, but you are currently grouped with another bard<br/>
and they are playing a song (Hymn for example) - will it affect you while<br/>
dueling someone OUTSIDE of your group?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
