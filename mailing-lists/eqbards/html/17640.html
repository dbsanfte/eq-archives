<br/>
&gt; the provocation song just pisses me off to no extent.<br/>
<br/>
Heh, guess they succeeded &lt;eg&gt; ?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; since when does a<br/>
&gt; bard have to target a fellow player to get the effect of their song?<br/>
also,<br/>
&gt; the player does not have to be grouped with the bard.  AND the song only<br/>
&gt; lasts one pulse<br/>
<br/>
Locating song and Charillion songs fit this model.  None of the buff songs<br/>
do.  (I hate to do this but I will...) It&#39;s like they were gonna give us<br/>
Bind Affinity or some sort of special purpose but then at the last moment<br/>
backed off and said: &quot;oh hell, give them some kinda half-ass buff, maybe a<br/>
rune, toss in some str/agi/or dex and a bit of speed - that should keep them<br/>
happy...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; , you have to refresh it like chain or bellow.  this song is<br/>
&gt; so completely un-bardlike.  another wasted slot in our spellbook as far as<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; can tell.<br/>
<br/>
Another one of GZ&#39;s own &#39;good ideas&#39; ???  Certainly not something that<br/>
someone who actually plays a bard (or even in groups with bards at levels 45<br/>
and up) would have thought of.  Unless they think that it is something a<br/>
bard can use to increase a warrior or other player&#39;s taunt to direct a mob&#39;s<br/>
agression (away from the bard or current fenzy victim)?<br/>
