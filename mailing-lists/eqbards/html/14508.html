<div id="ygrps-yiv-467562518">My main problem is that it is readily apparent that they aren&#39;t trying, at<br/>
least as far as testing is concerned.  Nearly every change they put in does<br/>
not work the first time.  This would not happen if they test half as much as<br/>
they claim to.  Heck 1/10th as much as they claim to.  I&#39;d actually feel<br/>
better if they just said, well we don&#39;t do much testing we don&#39;t have time.<br/>
What really gets my butt burning is that they have the arrogance to lie and<br/>
say they do test thoroughly, when it is blazingly apparent upon a single<br/>
glance that they don&#39;t test hardly anything even the one time it takes to go<br/>
fire it up.  That&#39;s the inexcusable part.  Not that there are bugs or<br/>
problems, but that they can&#39;t bear to be truthful as to why the bugs get<br/>
onto the live servers in the first place.  If GZ is even remotely accurate<br/>
when he says, &quot;you should see the ones we do catch&quot;, then the ones they do<br/>
catch must crash the entire game because they sure can&#39;t seem to notice when<br/>
changes they put in just flat out do nothing.<br/>

On the other hand, here&#39;s how I saw it:<br/>
<br/>
I logged in and immediately tested clouding.  After finding out it didn&#39;t<br/>
work, I wrote it off to another snafu and still am happy they decided to put<br/>
the change in.  This doesn&#39;t mean we WON&#39;T get it.  It just means it&#39;ll be<br/>
next patch or the one after.  Big deal.  After a year of playing this game,<br/>
an improvement like this isn&#39;t going to kill me coming in a week or 2 late.<br/>
I don&#39;t plan on quitting the game any time soon, so in 4 months from now I<br/>
won&#39;t even remember &quot;that week or 2 I &#39;should&#39; have had the see invis<br/>
component and didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t imagine being in a job where EVERY thing I did was questioned,<br/>
analyzed, reanalyzed, condemned and 2nd guessed at least 140,000 times.<br/>
Where you do something you see as positive and a section of people will<br/>
always think it sucks.  How many changes went into the patch?  1 or 2 things<br/>
they missed for whatever reason doesn&#39;t account for much.  Especially when<br/>
they WILL be fixed sooner rather than later.  Shit does happen and I&#39;m glad<br/>
someone (or 170,000 someone&#39;s) isn&#39;t there nitpicking at every move I make.<br/>
<br/>
To compare an ever-evolving game with this large of a player base to a<br/>
single player game isn&#39;t fair.  And I can think of numerous &quot;professionally<br/>
released&quot; pieces of software that are released buggy.  Oftentimes with a<br/>
patch that does a worse job of explaining any fix if a fix even comes.  I&#39;ll<br/>
name Windows 98 as a prime example.  I feel Verant is doing as good a job<br/>
with what they&#39;re working with as ANY group could.  With them, at least we<br/>
know they ARE trying.  They may f*ckup, but they will keep trying.  And one<br/>
day another game will come out that we&#39;ll all love to play more.  But, they<br/>
obviously are doing something right, right now, or we all wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
playing or be so passionate about it.<br/>
