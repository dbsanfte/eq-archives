<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815087773">Did anyone read the post on the Whineplay a couple of weeks ago that stated<br/>
that the biggest mistake Verant ever made with EQ was including CH in the<br/>
game?  It was actually a very interesting post.  In a nutshell, the poster<br/>
claimed that because CH, when cast on warrior, is the most powerful spell in<br/>
the game, Verant had to balance the game accordingly to compensate.  In<br/>
other words, Verant assumes that most, if not all groups, will have at least<br/>
one warrior and cleric in them, especially when fighting the tougher mobs in<br/>
the game.  In order to make sure the game was still challenging, the<br/>
difficulty of the game, i.e. mob toughness, had to be increased to<br/>
compensate for the warrior/cleric combo.  <br/>
<br/>
The poster then went on to say that, had Verant never put CH in the game,<br/>
and instead Superior Heal was the best heal spell in the game, then it would<br/>
be easier for everyone to form viable 6 man groups.  Groups would be willing<br/>
to have paladins, rangers and shadowknights as main tanks.  Groups would be<br/>
willing to use druids and shamans as main healers.  Clerics would still be<br/>
the best healers, their Superior Heal being more mana efficient than<br/>
druids/shamans.  Additionally, Verant would not have had to increase the<br/>
difficulty of the game in order to compensate for the warrior/cleric combo.<br/>
<br/>
Of course most of the replies to the thread were whiners screaming foul<br/>
because someone was calling for CH to get nerfed, which wasn&#39;t the case at<br/>
all.<br/>

<br/>
complete heal is the most powerful spell in the game.  but obviously a<br/>
cleric needs to know how to use it along with their other heals effectively.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Agreed my point (which I didn&#39;t elucidate) I find a lot of <br/>
&gt; clerics who seem<br/>
&gt; to think that C Heal is the only heal they need to keep <br/>
&gt; memmed and only heal<br/>
&gt; when everyone gets that low.  It seems to me downtime is the <br/>
&gt; lowest when<br/>
&gt; done exactly as you describe.<br/>
