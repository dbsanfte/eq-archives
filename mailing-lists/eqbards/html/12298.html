 </span></blockquote>???  What you describe is exactly what I saw.<br/>
<br/>
He was barely 31 and lost about a quarter bubble into 30 (I&#39;ll<br/>
assume he lost less than me due to class/race differences).  <br/>
That tells you a level 31 death costs (for him) a bit more<br/>
than quarter of a level 30 bubble.<br/>
<br/>
When he died &quot;barely&quot; 30, he lost almost nothing into 29.  <br/>
That tell syou a level 30 death costs (for him) so little of a<br/>
level 30 bubble that he considered himself &quot;barely&quot; into it.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, a level 31 death costs (for him) a quarter level 30<br/>
bubble, while a level 30 death costs a smidgeon of a level 30<br/>
bubble.  So a level 31 death takes away more exp than a level<br/>
30 death, just like I saw.<br/>
