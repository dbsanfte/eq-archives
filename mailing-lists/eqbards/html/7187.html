&gt;Ok, Ok, there are several things missing in EQ, but more that anything<br/>
&gt;else is this: <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	A list of spells and what they do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Am I the only one who noticed and is frustrated by this? Bards seem to<br/>
&gt;be affect less by this than other classes, but they are still affected. <br/>

for eq to not be well documented. They feel a lot of fun comes from<br/>
discovering these things yourself and in a way i agree. Except that a TON<br/>
of things in eq are broken like quests, songs, spells, etc so you dont know<br/>
if you just have yet to figure out what the song does or if indeed it is<br/>
broken. This is ridicoulsly frustrating and absolutely inexcusable. Making<br/>
people waste DAYS only to find out something is not working is absolutely<br/>
horrible and right now this is by far my biggest problem with the game. If<br/>
they posted a bug list of things known to not be working that would answer<br/>
most of my complaints. I dont mind trying to find out what stuff does, but<br/>
i dont even bother anymore cause most of the time its just broken. That imo<br/>
takes all of the fun out of it. And i havent done a single quest yet unless<br/>
i read a complete spoiler documenting it works, cause otherwise its<br/>
GUARANTEED to be broken. Now how horrible is that? :(</div>
