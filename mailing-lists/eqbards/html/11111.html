&lt;&lt; Anyway why would you state it&#39;s SO OBVIOUS?  Why shouldn&#39;t a speed type<br/>
 effect counter a non-speed type effect? Seems right logical to me. If there<br/>
 is a bug - it&#39;s that the root icon doesn&#39;t disappear after being countered. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, root cuts out SoW and Selo&#39;s (if you cut the song), so why should <br/>
SoW and Selo&#39;s not cut out root? The dread wolves use some steal str that <br/>
cuts out any str enhancer, and any str enahncer cuts out the steal str. Going <br/>
by what Maev said, people using spirit of the bear or whatever to combat that <br/>
are exploiting! My! They should be banned on the spot! How dare they!???<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, just my 2cp.<br/>
