<br/>
     I simply said that it&#39;s a hot-button issue.  An issue that no argument<br/>
or anything anyone says is going to change a another&#39;s strongly-held view on<br/>
the subject.  Regardless of what &quot;side&quot; people are on this issue - I&#39;ve<br/>
found that to be the case.<br/>
<br/>
    This is true with any other hot-button issue: gun-control;<br/>
welfare-reform, Chevy Vs Ford Trucks, whether Walter Payton or Barry Sanders<br/>
is the best running-back of all time; etc etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
    If you did understand my point - but feel the issue is so sensitive that<br/>
it can&#39;t even be used as an analogy - I apologize for upsetting you.<br/>
