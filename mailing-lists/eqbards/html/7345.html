<b>Subject:</b> Accelerando vs Chain breaking root <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-371832646">I haven&#39;t been rooted since I gained level 23 (Chain song) or since the<br/>
patch that removed the ability to break root with Accelerando.  As a result,<br/>
I can&#39;t test this for myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Knowing that you can break root with Chains by targetting yourself, what<br/>
happens once the root is broken? Do you suffer the effects of Chains until<br/>
it wears off or can you move at normal speeds?   This is a viable tactic to<br/>
use if you resume moving at normal speeds.  If you suffer the effects of<br/>
Chain, it doesn&#39;t appear to be a viable option to me unless you assume the<br/>
effect of the Chain will wear out before the original root would.<br/>

It is pretty easy to tell whether Selo Accelarado breaks the root or the <br/>
root just wore off by itself.  If Selo breaks the root, the ROOT Icon will <br/>
still remain for the duration even when you are freely moving around.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Selo Accelarado breaks root or not, but I am sure Selo Chain<br/>
<br/>
breaks root.  Again, the Root Icon remains for 15 to 20 second even after I <br/>
was moving around freely.  And I don&#39;t think it has to do with the level of <br/>
the person who rooted you.  I was lv 47 at the time and the wizard who <br/>
rooted me was lv 49.  I was about to break it with Selo Chain.  We were <br/>
indoor so I couldn&#39;t test Accelerado.<br/>

&gt;people thought they &quot;broke&quot; it - it simply wore off at the same time. </span></blockquote></div>
