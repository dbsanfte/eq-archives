<div id="ygrps-yiv-261809014">sorry about Lull, meant lament actually.  I think that&#39;s way more useful at<br/>
9th level than Snare.  I agree we shouldn&#39;t become casters, point is of the<br/>
supposed hybrids only bards would ever even consider taking on that role,<br/>
the rest are just warriors with perks and a bit less fighting abilty.  True<br/>
armor doesn&#39;t make up for parry and riposte, but since we don&#39;t get those<br/>
either how are we better off or more of a melee/caster hybrid than a shaman?<br/>
Our duel wield is more than compensated for in melee by their Slam, high<br/>
strength, high hp&#39;s, and big damage weapons. Sure at 30+ level we might pass<br/>
them up due to having 30 extra skill points.  At 15th level though the skill<br/>
difference does not compensate.  I think we get a choice between sitting<br/>
back casting, and getting in there in melee, often that is determined not by<br/>
what we are better at, but by what we are not worse at.<br/>
Only SoW is as useful as accellerando?  Maybe or Gate, but nothing is as<br/>
useful as bind affinity.<br/>

&gt; You argued that their spells are useful later on.  Snare is nifty, but as<br/>
&gt; useful as Kellin&#39;s Lull?, no.<br/>
<br/>
Well if you&#39;re going to play the level game, Lullaby is level<br/>
15.  Aside from Accelerando and SoW, I would say Snare is The<br/>
Most Useful spell in the game at level 9.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As useful as Acellerando?, no.  At 9th level,<br/>
<br/>
Only SoW is as useful as Accelerando.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and obviously before,if not for our entire careers, our spells are far<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; a defining part of our characters than any of the &#39;hybrids&#39; (RNG,PAL,SHD).<br/>
&gt; As far as I have heard it is NEVER suggested that any of these classes<br/>
stand<br/>
&gt; back and just cast spells in a group.  Most on this list advocate that<br/>
role<br/>
&gt; for bards later in levels.  The main point was we are more dependant on<br/>
<br/>
Um, I think you&#39;re misinterpreting what higher level bards are<br/>
saying - you *can* do this and *sometimes* it&#39;s better to do<br/>
this *in a group*, but never throwing yourself in there with<br/>
weapons swinging would be just as bad as never singing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; spells than RNG, PAL, or SHD.  We are at least as dependent on spells as<br/>
&gt; Shamans and Clerics, though probably not druids.  There have even been<br/>
<br/>
I think I see now how the bard combat ability vs. cleric<br/>
combat ability thread got sidetracked to bard vs. cleric...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; articles proclaiming Shamans to be the ultimate warrior class.  Buff like<br/>
&gt; mad, rush into melee cause you&#39;re big, strong, have armor equal to a<br/>
ranger,<br/>
&gt; and a big stick to swing.<br/>
<br/>
A shaman who does this at higher levels is going to be turned<br/>
into puree.  Armor helps, but not as much as parry and<br/>
riposte.  My L30 ranger friend in banded, but with parry and<br/>
riposte tanks better than me at L35 in plate.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve<br/>
been complaining about our dodge being capped so low.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If bards should be standing back and taking a<br/>
&gt; caster role, doesn&#39;t that make us more like, than unlike, those classes<br/>
&gt; whatever they are?<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s the impression you&#39;re getting and somehow I&#39;ve<br/>
contributed to it, then I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
There are two aspects of combat - offense and defense.  The<br/>
way these two mix is often difficult to understand, which is<br/>
why people always ask whether you should sing Hymn during<br/>
combat, or why the DDD/CoD/Hymn combo works better than<br/>
weapons in some cases but not others.  Better offense kills<br/>
mobs faster (shortens the fight).  Better defense lets you<br/>
survive longer (lengthens the duration you can survive a<br/>
fight).<br/>
<br/>
Not being good at tanking (defense) doesn&#39;t mean you have to<br/>
avoid melee (offense).  You just have to fiddle around with<br/>
your song taunt effects so that the mobs usually end up<br/>
attacking the true tanks.  While our area effect DoTs can do<br/>
better than our weapons in certain situations, most of the<br/>
time our weapons are the best way to contribute to the group<br/>
(with songs sung).  If we get into a situation where more<br/>
defense is required (magic resist, more healing), then I&#39;ll<br/>
switch to instruments and stand back.  If we need to kill a<br/>
mob quick though (e.g. spawn coming up), I&#39;m right in there<br/>
with my blades.<br/>
<br/>
Most classes don&#39;t get this choice.  They just fight and let<br/>
the random number generator determine the outcome.<br/>
