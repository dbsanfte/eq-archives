<div id="ygrps-yiv-611655882">Thanks muchly for that.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the horn worked since there<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to any kind of dance or animation at all with it.  Is that<br/>
normal?  I did notice a horn mouthpiece in Qeynos when I spent a few<br/>
minutes there the other day, is that anything useful?  Or have I just<br/>
missed something totally obvious on my infrequent travels!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m out for the day, so I think I&#39;ll leave it running at just<br/>
the point you suggest!!  Thanks again<br/>

&gt;You want to use a plain ol&#39; horn. And you will miss MANY notes at first. I <br/>
&gt;would suggest going someone far away from people, kicking the song up, and <br/>
&gt;let it sit for a couple hours. That will give you a good start into the <br/>
&gt;skill. And contrary to what some people say, you do not have to have a target <br/>
&gt;for the skill to rise. <br/>
&gt;The place I chose for my AFK practice was in Qeynos Hills all the way across <br/>
&gt;the zone from the entrance to the karana&#39;s, up on the hill. I didn&#39;t see one <br/>
&gt;living thing and even after letting it sit all night I was still alive :)<br/>
&gt;Anyways, good luck to ya.<br/>
