&gt; Okay, here&#39;s a question.  For the lambent vambraces one of the things you<br/>
&gt; need is fiery vambraces from a solusek champion.  I know there is a kobold<br/>
&gt; champion in Solusek B, but this seems like a pretty hard kill to aquire this<br/>
&gt; item (in comparison to the other pieces).  Not having spent much time in<br/>
&gt; Solusek A, I was wondering if there&#39;s a goblin champion there that this<br/>
&gt; might be referring to instead?  Anyone know much about Sol A that has an<br/>
&gt; answer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The kobold champion seems to be a named mob in Sol B.  The<br/>
Solusek champions in Sol A seem to be just another type of<br/>
goblin.  I&#39;ve seen three on tracking at once, and two in the<br/>
same room.  They appear at various spots around Sol A, mostly<br/>
in the section around the king room and bar area.<br/>
