<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722397482">We are actually on multiple servers, I believe we are represented actively<br/>
on at least 4 servers. Fennin Ro was the first server, and the one most of<br/>
us spend time on. We have long debated how to handle this, and ultimately,<br/>
we are seeking qualified, interested people who will lead the Soerbaird<br/>
initiative on their home servers. <br/>
<br/>
We are in the process of deciding how this structure would work, and any<br/>
input fellow bards (and even non-bards) have, would be great.<br/>
<br/>
A few of us have noticed with great interest the high quality of roleplay<br/>
events happening on other servers. During P4, it was concluded that Fennin<br/>
Ro would be *the* roleplay server. Much to our delight (and sometimes<br/>
dismay) RP is just as strong if not stronger elsewhere. This is quickening<br/>
our desire to work out the multiple server issue. That said, the reality is<br/>
that you have to be neither a Soerbard, nor a bard to contribute works in<br/>
Iona Hall (our public library).<br/>
<br/>
If any of you on other servers have an interest in leading the Soerbaird<br/>
effort on your server, you should send email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:soerbaird@...">soerbaird@...</a> or<br/>
fill out a Soerbaird application on our web site.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and about the memorizing thing... this is an IC requirement. It&#39;s<br/>
difficult to type in your ballads quickly and without error in EQ - the goal<br/>
being to not bore your audience with long lapses and tons of typos. The IC<br/>
representation of typos or long pauses are missed notes and forgetfulness<br/>
respectively.<br/>

&gt; - The entry fee is 10p not 100p Yeesh! I wonder where that mis-info came<br/>
&gt; from...<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s another bard guild website that says the<br/>
entrance fee is 100pp as a joke.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I should state further that the REAL<br/>
&gt; barrier of entry to The Soerbaird is in some duties a new student must<br/>
&gt; perform. All of this can be found on the web site<br/>

I just glanced over it, and I must say I *really* like the<br/>
idea of having these sorts of requirements for a guild.  Of<br/>
course, the memorization thing, what&#39;s to keep a player from<br/>
having the book in front of him when you test him?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, like most guild web pages I&#39;ve seen, you do not<br/>
flat out say what server you&#39;re on.  The only way I figured<br/>
that out was a news item listing the server as Fennin Ro.<br/>
