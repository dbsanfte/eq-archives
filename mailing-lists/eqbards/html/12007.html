<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587572152">I know a lot of you don&#39;t bother to read the FAQ, but if I could encourage <br/>
you all to go over it at least once.  I have a lot of information on there <br/>
that will help with some frequently asked questions (thus the title....), <br/>
as well as a collation of the magical instruments in EQ.  I would sincerely <br/>
appreciate you higher-levels going over that list with a fine-toothed comb <br/>
for me and correcting my booboos.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
