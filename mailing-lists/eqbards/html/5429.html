Freeport to Qeynos. Trumpy. Easy Kill. Kaladim. Money. No problem. Wife in<br/>
Halas, pick her up and escort her back while I&#39;m there. Two birds, one<br/>
stone.<br/>
<br/>
Hrmph.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bard. I run and run fast. I&#39;m level 17 and can actually travel through<br/>
Highpass fairly comfortably. Even stopping for a fight with a Gnoll or Orc<br/>
if he&#39;s alone and I&#39;m in the mood. If not, I run and run fast. Also, I&#39;m a<br/>
bard. I&#39;m poor and I need money. Being the local mailboy just isn&#39;t making<br/>
up for the price of my combine and my dirk.<br/>
<br/>
I put on my boots, check my supplies, grab my trusty drum and head out of<br/>
Freeport on my way to Qeynos. Figured I&#39;d actually time myself to see how<br/>
fast I can make the cross country trip. I&#39;m thinking I can do it in 30<br/>
minutes or so of real time. Let&#39;s see if I&#39;m right. It&#39;s now 1:30 in the<br/>
afternoon - should be there shortly after 2:00 and be headed home for a late<br/>
lunch around 3:00 at a Freeport Inn.<br/>
<br/>
Off we go out the gates.. through the east commons, through the west commons<br/>
barely resisting the temptation to stop at the rare full dervish camp that<br/>
no other adventurers were killing at and head into Kithicor. Hop the hobbit<br/>
hole and continue to the Highpass entrance. Yay, making great time - what a<br/>
breeze. Head through Highpass, grab some mail at the Keep (every gold<br/>
counts), and head back out to East Karana. Little bit of a stop for the<br/>
mail, but no biggie.<br/>
<br/>
As a younger more cautious Bard I would head straight for the water of the<br/>
Karana&#39;s and follow it all the way to Qeynos Hills. But hey, I&#39;m level 17<br/>
and I run fast, I duel wield, I rock. I look at my map and see that I can<br/>
make a nearly straight line through the Karana&#39;s and probably save a good<br/>
amount of time. So off I go.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, there&#39;s a lot of Griff&#39;s out these days.. Through East Karana I go. I<br/>
see a young Shaman trying to run from a Griffawn and figure I could give her<br/>
a speed boost.. I invite her into a group. She joins, we run - run fast. Hit<br/>
the North Karana zone and make a rude gesture to the Griffawn before zoning.<br/>
She thanks me (I twisted Hymn while we were running and healed her) and we<br/>
ungroup. <br/>
<br/>
Through North Karana I go. This is almost too easy. And did I mention that<br/>
WOW there&#39;s a lot of Griff&#39;s out these days? I resist the temptation of<br/>
hitting South Karana for more mail as it&#39;s just too far out of the way and<br/>
after all, I&#39;m trying to see how fast I can make the trip.. I hit West<br/>
Karana and notice that my easy straight line goes into some mountains. Hrm..<br/>
Faster to go around or faster to climb and go straight.. *shrug* Shortest<br/>
distance is A to B right? Forward I go.<br/>
<br/>
Stop snickering.<br/>
<br/>
I hit the mountains going due west. (Go west young bard!) I see some Bandits<br/>
that are all green to me. Bah, I&#39;d love the loot but no time this trip. I<br/>
skirt around them and keep going. Nifty looking mountains these are.. I come<br/>
over a ridge and see a little temple. Aw, how cute. Ogres.<br/>
<br/>
Stop laughing at me.<br/>
<br/>
I con them all and they&#39;re all Amiable to me. Hrm.. what did I ever do for<br/>
them? Odd. Ok, this is where I admittedly made a really bad use of common<br/>
sense. Instead of making a wide path around them, I figured since they were<br/>
amiable to me I could just run right by and wave as I did it. After all,<br/>
they like me right?<br/>
<br/>
*ahem*<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see who hit me. I didn&#39;t see what damage they did. I was simply<br/>
slain. No dropping of the health bar. Just slain.<br/>
<br/>
Freeport. Yay. *sigh* Normally I don&#39;t bother myself with buying a spare<br/>
drum but this time, my corpse is farther than it&#39;s ever been lost before. I<br/>
run to the bank, grab some money, run to the guild (yay, same zone) and grab<br/>
a drum and off I go. My trip to the point where my corpse is was a little<br/>
more nervous - but uneventful. Ah, there it is. My lonely body. At the edge<br/>
of the Ogre camp between two white rock thingies - and of course, two<br/>
Amiable conning Ogres.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to figure out why they attacked me I make a circle around the temple<br/>
making sure to con everything there. Ah, there it is. Chief Dooga.<br/>
Threateningly. How rude. Oh well, no time to ask him what his problem is,<br/>
gotta get my corpse. I inch my way down while bashing on my /corpse hot key<br/>
when all the sudden the Ogre&#39;s notice me. Without thinking I turned and ran<br/>
hoping maybe I&#39;d just lead them far enough away then go in a circle back to<br/>
the temple and /corpse my body along to the zone border or something. How<br/>
fast can big Ogre&#39;s run anyway? Took a little damage this time, but still<br/>
alive and running. Hit F9 a couple times to see how far behind me they are<br/>
and notice something.. &quot;Chief Dooga&#39;s Pet&quot; is on my tail - and closing fast.<br/>
What an Ogre has a wolf for, I don&#39;t know. I run fast..<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
...not fast enough. Freeport. Yay. Again. So much for making the trip in<br/>
good time. Another drum, and a few platinum from the bank this time. I&#39;m<br/>
going to have to pay someone to help me or to make me invisible. Run back to<br/>
my corpse, again. There it is. I have no idea where my other &quot;drum holding&quot;<br/>
corpse is, but that&#39;s of no concern to me right now. Drums are cheap and I<br/>
gots a song.. I yell out for assistance and get a few replies. Tell them my<br/>
sad story and they&#39;re helpful as Nun&#39;s.. until they hear where my body is.<br/>
&quot;Oh, sorry - I uh, I have to go get dinner. Good luck though!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Finally, someone offers to cast Invisibility on me. Yay! I&#39;m invisible! I<br/>
had to go to them, so now I&#39;m kind turned around. Start up the Locating song<br/>
and poof. I&#39;m visible again. How rude. Beg for another invisibility spell<br/>
while still facing the direction the song pointed me in and started a<br/>
running.. no selo&#39;s. How slow. Poor non-bards of the world.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s my corpse. Yay, found it. I hit F9 a few times, yup - still<br/>
invisible. Start inching my way down towards my corpse while bashing my<br/>
/corpse key.. Yay! &quot;Pulling your corpse&quot; message.. Apparently, Ogres don&#39;t<br/>
like to see moving corpses. They start running towards the only thing they<br/>
can see. The corpse. I turn to run again (don&#39;t see the pet) all the while<br/>
bashing that /corpse key..<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
..&quot;You do not have any corpses in this zone&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Freeport. Again. Did I mention that I had originally planned on<br/>
making this as fast of a trip as possible? Ok, ANOTHER drum and back to my<br/>
corpse. My lord, the number of Griff&#39;s increases the number of times you run<br/>
through the Karana&#39;s. At no time did I have less than two in my visible<br/>
window no matter which way I looked. Anyway, back to my corpse which is now<br/>
far enough away from the Ogre&#39;s to loot. BAH! Two bandits standing right<br/>
next to it having a tea party. *sigh* Wait. Bandits finally start running..<br/>
towards me. I run out of their way and they run by. *phew* Go to my corpse,<br/>
pull it even farther away just to be safe and loot it. Loot the other<br/>
corpse. Go find my third corpse. Yay. 4 drums. Curse the Ogre&#39;s and head to<br/>
Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Arrive at Qeynos at around 5:30. So much for speed timing. Pick up some mail<br/>
then head over to the bar to see Trumpy. Give him the phrase that pays and<br/>
this time he doesn&#39;t go anywhere. Instead his goons come after me, thus<br/>
causing the bouncer to come after me. Goons green, bouncer red. I run, run<br/>
fast. I zone. Well that stinks. I can&#39;t get Trumpy out of the bar anymore. I<br/>
go back, zoned and forgotten and watch someone else pull Trumpy out of the<br/>
bar. Silly high elf, attacked Trumpy only 10 steps from the bar. Silly high<br/>
elf killed Trumpy then died. Checked where high elf was, and noticed he<br/>
wasn&#39;t in Qeynos anymore Toto. What the heck, feel kind of low for doing it,<br/>
but I&#39;ll wait here and just get the head from the dead Trumpy. I right click<br/>
on Trumpy&#39;s corpse a few times and WHACK! Multiple hits in the back from the<br/>
bouncer. I start to run, but down to only 1 bubble of health - don&#39;t run<br/>
very fast..<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
Freeport. *sigh* Yes. I should have gotten bound. No, I didn&#39;t get bound. To<br/>
the bank, to the guild, FAR around the Ogre camp we go. Wife loots corpse in<br/>
Qeynos (except two mailbags of course), we meet in North Karana and run home<br/>
to Freeport. Running fast. With 5 drums and no Trumpy body parts and no<br/>
mail.<br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story? The faster you try to make a trip, the longer it&#39;ll take<br/>
you and the less money you&#39;ll make. And did I mention how incredibly high<br/>
the griff count is lately?</div>
