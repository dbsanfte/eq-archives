&gt; Why do you want bind again?  The xp you gain back in 10 minutes after dying<br/>
&gt; is tiny, what is the point of bind of wanting bind?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Getting the exp back is not the problem.  The problem is that<br/>
most people divide the game into &quot;quality&quot; playtime (fighting<br/>
mobs, exploring, etc), and &quot;wasted&quot; playtime (traveling,<br/>
running back to your corpse, waiting for mana/hp to<br/>
regenerate).<br/>
<br/>
To a lot of people (I am not one of them), increasing the<br/>
amount of wasted playtime by forcing people to run back to<br/>
their corpses is ridiculous and really detracts from the game.<br/>
Even though it may be only 10 minutes, the subjective impact<br/>
is much greater.  I timed my group&#39;s activities one night.  We<br/>
spent 10 minutes traveling, 6 hours fighting almost non-stop,<br/>
then 15 minutes traveling back.  The last 15 minutes, people<br/>
were really griping about how they hated having to waste time<br/>
running back and forth, even though it accounted for less than<br/>
10% of our total playtime.<br/>
