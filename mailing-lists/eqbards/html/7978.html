even with, I don&#39;t recall).  It&#39;s for this reason I prefer Chords or<br/>
Denon&#39;s to bellow, as the overall damage inflicted is greater.  It&#39;s not<br/>
as noticeable since you don&#39;t get the instant hit report, but there&#39;s<br/>
definitely more of it (especially if you swap in your lute between swings<br/>
;).<br/>
