&gt; warrior, paladin, and ranger with most of the best equipment in the game<br/>
&gt; (there are many of these in my guild) could solo an HG.  what do you think<br/>
&gt; about monk?  i&#39;m sure they could as well.  bards?  of course we can ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You&#39;re right, never is too strong.<br/>
<br/>
  You&#39;ve got a one in a million chance to solo an HG if you are <br/>
  a warrior, paladin, monk, ranger, rogue.<br/>
<br/>
  HG = 4k HP, hits 96 x 2.  Warrior = 1800 HP, hits 50 x 4  at most.<br/>
                                            or hits 100 x 2 at most.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not telling you a lie, when I say the HG will outlast the warrior.<br/>
<br/>
  In fact the delay of an HG is probably on par with about 20-25,<br/>
  because those mofo&#39;s swing fast and hard.<br/>
<br/>
  No melee class has ever solo&#39;d a HG toe to toe that I&#39;ve ever heard of.<br/>
  If someone wants to test this out or ask a L50 warrior if they are<br/>
  willing to try it, that would be cool.  Monks? hahahahahaha, sorry.<br/>
