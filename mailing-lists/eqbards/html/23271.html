<br/>
aye i read it.  was a very intelligent post, and i agree with it.  it was<br/>
not a call for a nerf, just an analysis of the game.  it is far too late to<br/>
remove or nerf CH, because as you said, the difficulty of the game is in<br/>
every way tuned to this spell.  there is no way we could do the raids we do<br/>
without warriors and CH.  you can do certain experience groups without a<br/>
cleric, though it is rare.  even before the SoT upgrade, you could do many<br/>
more experience groups without an enchanter, but then and now it is almost<br/>
always  prerequisite that you have a cleric.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did anyone read the post on the Whineplay a couple of weeks<br/>
&gt; ago that stated<br/>
&gt; that the biggest mistake Verant ever made with EQ was<br/>
&gt; including CH in the<br/>
&gt; game?  It was actually a very interesting post.  In a<br/>
&gt; nutshell, the poster<br/>
&gt; claimed that because CH, when cast on warrior, is the most<br/>
&gt; powerful spell in<br/>
&gt; the game, Verant had to balance the game accordingly to<br/>
&gt; compensate.  In<br/>
&gt; other words, Verant assumes that most, if not all groups,<br/>
&gt; will have at least<br/>
&gt; one warrior and cleric in them, especially when fighting the<br/>
&gt; tougher mobs in<br/>
&gt; the game.  In order to make sure the game was still challenging, the<br/>
&gt; difficulty of the game, i.e. mob toughness, had to be increased to<br/>
&gt; compensate for the warrior/cleric combo.<br/>
