 </span></blockquote>Yet, anyway.  The precedent is already set, I suppose.  I&#39;m not framiliar<br/>
with every magical weapon/armor piece in the game as it is.  While more and<br/>
more are added not only will I have to remember what they are and do, but<br/>
their code as well.  I&#39;ll continue to ask people what the hell they&#39;re<br/>
talking about, and likely continue to forget the acronyms.  Just the way my<br/>
brain is wired, I suppose.  I&#39;m not much for foreign languages, codes, or<br/>
strings of random numbers.  When I hear &quot;black robe&quot; I get an image in my<br/>
mind, when I hear FBR I get nothing (actually I think of Roosevelt).   It&#39;s<br/>
like I know everyone&#39;s first and last name at work, but if someone began<br/>
referring to everyone by their initials I would be lost.<br/>
<br/>
And by the way... the notion that acronym usage, or grammatical lazziness is<br/>
somehow the natural evolution of the english language is completely false.<br/>
It&#39;s the old argument grade schoolers use in an attempt to get out of their<br/>
studies.  The language&#39;s rules and structure changes over many generations<br/>
very slowly, not when individuals misuse the language, or when a subculture<br/>
comes up with slang amoungst themselves.  Old English did not become Middle<br/>
English over night.  Three people from 1900, 2000 and 2100 would be able to<br/>
understand each other, though they would note a strangeness in the other&#39;s<br/>
dialect.  The idea that one can just abuse the langauge because that&#39;s the<br/>
way it evolves is misplaced.  Not the way it works!  The langauge actually<br/>
evolves not by the breaking of its rules, but the other way around: the<br/>
addition of new rules and words.<br/>
