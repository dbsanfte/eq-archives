&gt; The &#39;absolute&#39; part is debatable - imho.   We have heard snippets of &quot;we<br/>

&gt; that they (Verant) are concerned with &#39;how hard&#39; it is to make levels, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  Please don&#39;t think by &quot;absolute&quot; I mean &quot;whatever<br/>
Verant thinks.&quot;  By &quot;absolute&quot; I mean if you had a million<br/>
years to play out the change over and over and see if the<br/>
outcome were consistently positive or negative.  I find myself<br/>
scratching my head a lot of times wondering just what the h*ll<br/>
Verant is thinking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, but even that is not so clear cut.  What may be fun and<br/>
have high retention in the short-term may not be so fun and<br/>
have cause low retention in the long term.  UO had that<br/>
problem with houses.  You could own a house, everyone liked<br/>
it, and it was a major reason for people playing the game.  <br/>
Then the world filled up with houses, they started to get in<br/>
your way, and a lot of players have quit because of them.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;absolute,&quot; I&#39;m referring more to what is best for the game<br/>
(and thus the overall playerbase) over the lifespan of the<br/>
game.<br/>
