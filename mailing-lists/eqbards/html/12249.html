<b>Subject:</b> Re: Song Fizzles upon leveling <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037533853">I can&#39;t agree with you more.  WHen I read that post, I knew it was<br/>
flawed...  (I was waiting for someone else to say something, figured<br/>
maybe I was just imagining it).<br/>
As both my main char (cleric, 112 wis, skills all maxed) and bard (104<br/>
dex, 118 cha, skills maxed in the songs I use), whenever I level it is<br/>
fizzle city...  I miss notes and fizz spells I have been casting<br/>
(singing) for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Great example happened last THurs (I play my cleric on THurs only, so<br/>
actually my bard may soon pass him).  Clerics uses the same heal spell<br/>
from lvl 4 to lvl 14 (light healing).  I was at lvl 12 (alteration<br/>
obviously maxed), fizzles were so rare I never even factoered them into<br/>
a fight (I assume this means 5%).  DING, Welcome to lvl 13.  5 fizzles<br/>
in two fights (6 succeful heals, so it was 5 fizz in 11 tries).  I would<br/>
pass it off as random chance, except for it seems to happen every single<br/>
level.  I had similar results trying to run from a dervish at lvl 11<br/>
with my bard, I missed notes 5 out of 7 tries (I lost the song once I<br/>
got it going from stun).<br/>
<br/>
On a second but maybe related note, I believe the random number genrator<br/>
may be flawed in the game.  I see too many long runs of unlikly events<br/>
(both good and bad).  This would be far from unheard of, as random<br/>
number generators are eseentially impossible to code.  (People just<br/>
write code that approximates random number generartion).  I did a study<br/>
of the random number generator built into the 8088 (basically the<br/>
original IBM PC) processor.  (I used a few different languages to try to<br/>
eliminate any effect they had on it).  I basically graphed a &quot;random&quot; x<br/>
and y cooordinate, drawing a line from point 1 to 2 to 3, etc...  The<br/>
plots always followed similar patterns... Weird, eh?<br/>
