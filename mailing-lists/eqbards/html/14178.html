&gt; &gt; Ugh! I&#39;m one of those people who find this stuff to be <br/>
&gt; annoying. I mean, if<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;re doing it on /say or /group that&#39;s fine, but IMO <br/>
&gt; (nothing humble about<br/>
&gt; &gt; it) it is obnoxious to broadcast this stuff and revel in <br/>
&gt; the complaints.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But in your favor, at least you&#39;re doing it on ooc where I <br/>
&gt; can turn this<br/>
&gt; &gt; off. :-P I really hate when people do this stuff on shout, which is<br/>
&gt; &gt; necessary for train updates. *Windleaf ducks the pie thrown by Papa*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No pie coming, I agree with you (essentially).  Spamming <br/>
&gt; shouts annoy me<br/>
&gt; as they are supposed to be in chracter and should be used for <br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; stuff (like trains).  It seems the point would be to do whatever you<br/>
&gt; want with (within reason).  Perhaps singing &quot;Come sail away&quot; is a bit<br/>
&gt; too far, but I dont see it as any difference than talking about Super<br/>
&gt; Bowl or your plans tonight.  Then again perhaps the reason I <br/>
&gt; had such an<br/>
&gt; awful day was all the bad karma generated when I was singing...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol! Well you get better far Karma from that than when I do a Riverdance.<br/>
:-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unfortunatly I am pretty ppor right now (20P maybe), however my druid<br/>
&gt; friend said he has a new whip for me (from Paw).  Any one know if its<br/>
&gt; any good?  I think he&#39;s just trying to bribe me into playing some<br/>
&gt; more...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yea, this is why around level 18 I started a magician and played him for a<br/>
while as I did a lot of soloing. It was a painful time for me as a bard.<br/>
Things really picked up for me about level 23 when I started soloing the<br/>
gargs. And a pack full of gargoyle eyes makes one pretty happy.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been waiting for this for a few years and will be <br/>
&gt; shocked when Blizzard<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally does release this. It&#39;s gotten to the point where I&#39;m pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-chalant about it. I was real excited for this to be <br/>
&gt; released early last<br/>
&gt; &gt; year. Let&#39;s see if they do indeed release it as expected.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll cut Blizzard some slack.  They have been REALLY good about making<br/>
&gt; their release dates in the past. And they&#39;re games are always released<br/>
&gt; in a nearly final version (as opposed to most companies, who release<br/>
&gt; games that I shudder to call Beta).  One big blown release date (they<br/>
&gt; are going to be min of 9 months late on this one) is very <br/>
&gt; forgivable if<br/>
&gt; the game is fairly clean when released.  I have no idea what they were<br/>
&gt; thinking when they made that original release date, I always <br/>
&gt; follow the<br/>
&gt; progress of games I am eager to play and I (knowing nothing other than<br/>
&gt; public info) could see they weren&#39;t going to come close to making it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I&#39;ve waited through at least 3 re-adjusted release dates that I can<br/>
recall for Diablo II, essentially 2 missed Christmas&#39;s and have kind of<br/>
soured on the game due to this. Also, EQ has definitely affected my desire<br/>
to play this, but my friends will probably buy Diablo II, so I&#39;ll end up<br/>
joining them.<br/>
<br/>
Diablo had it&#39;s share of bugs as well and tons of anti-hacking patches that<br/>
I&#39;m sure was the cause of delays for Diablo II. Diablo II initially looked<br/>
like it was going to be just an enhanced Diablo with some new places to hunt<br/>
and a new character, but has since evolved into a newer game.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well. If it&#39;s fun to play, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be there.<br/>
