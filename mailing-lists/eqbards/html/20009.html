<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339520296">I&#39;ve been noticing some strange things with chains recently.  It doesn&#39;t seem to be breaking early anymore (except rarely).  In fact, I don&#39;t get the break message until it would normally expire, even when root is cast after chains.  Also, when I rechain after root is cast, chains does not seem to break root anymore, either.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to test this out further as the root I&#39;m working with is a Mage pet&#39;s root, but here&#39;s what I&#39;m noticing:<br/>
<br/>
When mob is fleeing (experienced this in Karnors), pet roots and the mob turns around to attack.  Obviously, we can&#39;t have this :p so I chain.  Mob stays facing the party like it&#39;s still rooted.  It doesn&#39;t even turn around for a second (like if the pet had rooted immediately after I chained) and I haven&#39;t seen a 2nd root message.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else noticing any of this?  And, anyone else with access to a more standard root willing to test?<br/>
<br/>
If root and chains are in fact stacking, I&#39;m not sure if this is a plus or not.  I am always grouped with a mage, so the pet used to kill chains ALOT.  It&#39;s kinda nice to keep the slowdown effect while it&#39;s rooted, but I&#39;d like to see the mob stand there patiently trying to run away, too. :)<br/>
