<div id="ygrps-yiv-417385412">Yeah, I&#39;m not crazy about most Kunarkian &lt;40 mobs seeing invis either, but<br/>
if you&#39;re in the Frontier Mts. already, step into either the Mines of Nurga<br/>
or Temple of Droga zones and fight the Goblins there.  They&#39;re 28th to 38th<br/>
or thereabouts and NONE of them see invis.  In Nurga the mobs are<br/>
wonderfully spread out in twos and threes and would be great exp for a group<br/>
of 5 or 6.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great change of pace for invis to be useful in Kunark.  ;-/<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Switching subjects here, but I question the value of invisibility now.<br/>
&gt; Whats the rationale on why most mobs in Kunark see thru invis?  In my<br/>
&gt; experience with the older zones, the only mobs that could see thru invis<br/>
&gt; were undead and any mob that could cast the See Invis spell.  I&#39;ve walked<br/>
&gt; completely thru Mistmoore with invis song up and everything I saw conned<br/>
&gt; Indifferent.  Almost all of the mobs that were in there were yellow or<br/>
&gt; higher to me.  I realize there were a few other mobs that could see thru<br/>
&gt; invis but they were the exception not the norm.  Now it seems that for the<br/>
&gt; most part invisibility in Kunark is almost worthless.  I&#39;ve been fighting<br/>
&gt; the giants in Frontier Mtns and everyone one of them see thru invis even<br/>
&gt; though they are lower than 35th level.  So red mobs in Mistmoore can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; me but blue mobs in Frontier Mtns can?  Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>
&gt;  Also, by<br/>
&gt; the time a warrior is high enough level to get the armor that gives this<br/>
&gt; effect, almost everything he will be fighting can see thru invis because<br/>
&gt; they are a high level mob.  So I would imagine a lot of them view getting<br/>
&gt; Invisibility in their armor almost as much as we view getting Summon Water<br/>
&gt; as worthless.<br/>
