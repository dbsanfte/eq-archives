<b>Subject:</b> Lullaby theory <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189889130">I read a post the other day on the Concert Hall that has since scrolled off<br/>
so as a result I can&#39;t paste the full text into here.  Everything below is<br/>
from memory so if someone else remembers the post correct me if I left<br/>
something out or misstated the original posters comments.<br/>
<br/>
The original poster had a theory about the effect of equipping a lute while<br/>
singing lullaby.  Like other bards have commented, the poster had noticed<br/>
that mobs were still attacking him even though they did not resist the<br/>
lullaby and should have been sleeping.  In one combat he decided not to<br/>
equip the lute and instead just sang the lullaby.  He noticed that the mobs<br/>
stopped attacking him while they were asleep.  The song appeared to work<br/>
like it was supposed to.  The poster then stated a theory that perhaps<br/>
lullaby has two effects that mobs have a chance to resist, similar to DDD.<br/>
With DDD, you get the area of effect DOT plus the lowering of the mobs AC<br/>
effect. If the mobs fails one resist but makes the other then the song gets<br/>
fully resisted.  The posters theory was that lullaby had two effects and in<br/>
order to get both of them to work you have to equip the lute.  Singing the<br/>
song only has one effect of putting the mob to sleep.  Mobs only get one<br/>
resist check.  Singing the song while equipping a lute puts them to sleep<br/>
plus nixes the hate list.  Mob gets two resist checks.  If the mob makes one<br/>
the song doesn&#39;t effect him.  In this case there is a bug that still gives<br/>
you the &quot;head nods&quot; message when you should get a resist message.    <br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t had the chance to test this for myself so I thought I would throw it<br/>
out and see what everyone else thinks.<br/>
