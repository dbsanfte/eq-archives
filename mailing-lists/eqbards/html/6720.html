<div id="ygrps-yiv-960495179">So based on what you are saying, I could go into Feerot, target an ogre<br/>
guard (bouncer),  sing the carillion and make it to where I&#39;m not KOS<br/>
anymore, and then merrily waltz around the zone with no worry of ever<br/>
getting attacked by any ogre guards.   <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; It only works on one target but appears to last on all members of that<br/>
&gt; NPCs<br/>
&gt; &quot;type&quot; until you zone. make one shopkeeper happy and all of that &quot;type&quot;<br/>
&gt; which may vary. Make a guard happy and the shopkeepers don&#39;t like you<br/>
&gt; again...just a typical day in Highpass Hold/High Keep for me!<br/>
