<b>Subject:</b> Dual Bard Invisibility Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057648747">I&#39;ve read on the Bard Song Analysis page, that in a 2 bard party, you cannot<br/>
have one singing invisibility, and the other singing any other song (such as<br/>
healing, or see invis, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[Ziann] With 2 bards in the group... if you get separated and both are singing<br/>
invis you will go visible for a pulse when meeting up.  Also on the same note<br/>
you can not have 2 bards singing invis at the same time as both bards will go<br/>
visible on the song pulses.  This can be deadly when you are deep in a place<br/>
like Mistmoore Castle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[Kaearia] Any song will allow mobs to see you even if you are still<br/>
invisible.  e.g. If one bard is singing this song, and another is singing Hymn,<br/>
the mobs can see you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, my experience in a 2 bard party last night would seem to indicate<br/>
differently.  We seemed to be invis, and healing at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done any tests with this?<br/>
