It definitly was happening to me this weekend (I was right, taking a<br/>
week away from the game was a good thing, as I had mucho fun on Sunday,<br/>
got a grand total of 1 bub all day too).<br/>
<br/>
I was pulling in S karana (birds, elephants, centaurs, etc...) which<br/>
often involves a LOT of running and I would get back to the group with<br/>
only like 2 bubs of stamina.  All i would do is run close to monster,<br/>
bellow, run away (with selos on the whole time).  I thought maybe it was<br/>
just because I was pulling longer distances than I ever had before.<br/>

&gt; I hate to say this.. I mean I REALLY hate to say this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone noticed that stamina is now draining from us while running with<br/>
&gt; Accelerando?  I was just running through SK and found my stamina bar<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
