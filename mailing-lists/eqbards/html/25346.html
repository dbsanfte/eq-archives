<div id="ygrps-yiv-948236267">Haha Shada, you always were one for dueling though :).  I know you would have<br/>
given Thott some fun.  Given his equipment and his skill, I had confidence<br/>
Thott would beat everyone.  And will beat everyone...  <br/>
<br/>
I have never been a PvP person, and going into a battle I am sure to lose just<br/>
makes it less appealing.<br/>
<br/>
Often it&#39;s amazing fun to try things much harder than your current known level.<br/>
 But that&#39;s against non-sentient opponents.<br/>
<br/>
And apart from all the other reasons, I have to work.  The schedule didn&#39;t even<br/>
allow for me to go and watch.<br/>
<br/>
I made the point in another post that BotB rewards those already &#39;winning&#39; the<br/>
game even more.  I wonder how satisfying it is for those people.<br/>

P.S.  6 blue to go for 60 - PAIN<br/>
P.P.S.  WOOT on Hobben hehe<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I never mentioned the botb, he asked what bards like thott wear and I<br/>
&gt; gave him a short answer.  I even gave you a tell (was someone using you<br/>
&gt; for tracking as it turns out) asking why you weren&#39;t there.  It is for<br/>
&gt; fun, it sounds like if you perceive the contest this way you may even<br/>
&gt; perceive the game this way, no longer worth the effort.  If I was still<br/>
&gt; around, I would have joined KNOWING ABSOLUTELY that I would lose, cause<br/>
&gt; I would have had fun trying (and probably would still be 59 even though<br/>
&gt; it would be 4 months after i hit it hehe).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was the only person in the arena at 2:00pm when Thott logged on there<br/>
&gt; and we grouped and talked for a couple hours up to the event.  He even<br/>
&gt; admitted that he could have the best equipment in the game and lose if<br/>
&gt; he couldn&#39;t play worth a damn.  The fact is, regardless of having the<br/>
&gt; best equipment of any bard in the game, he is an extraordinary player,<br/>
&gt; in PvP as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I (49 monk now) killed my old rival Hobben, the co-leader of AL,<br/>
&gt; with a couple wizards I recruited which made the whole day worthwhile!<br/>
