<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-668549280">Well,<br/>
<br/>
as far as I can tell, the Mino Horns did not gain anything additional, even<br/>
though the patch message said they did.<br/>
<br/>
Would someone do some further testing to see if it increases radius of wind<br/>
songs, or adds to them or something?<br/>
