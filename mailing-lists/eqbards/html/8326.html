<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409163524">Hail and well met All,<br/>
We have been hunting the SG in S Ro for exp as well as Kilij plans. On <br/>
Xegony, the big hill in fromt of the zone wall is kinda buggy, mobs may go <br/>
invis if they chased you up it and some mobs won&#39;t chase you that far. We <br/>
pull to the base of the hill. My L35 cleirc frined and I took out the SG <br/>
with the plans by oursleves last night, we blasted it down to half before he <br/>
had to zone, and then I melee&#39;d and bellowed it to death alone! Had one <br/>
bubble of life left when he fell, hehe. I was one happy wood elf, last SG I <br/>
tried to finish off with melee, killed me instead. One problem we have had <br/>
was lots of the mummies and other junk like to jump in on the fight and <br/>
interrupt the caster&#39;s spells. The plans are lore items, btw. If you are on <br/>
Xegony and need some help getting plans, give me a tell if we are still in S <br/>
Ro. If I have a decent group hunting SG for exp, we should have np getting <br/>
more plans.  (Hey Slyde, was that you with 2 SG&#39;s after you last night? We <br/>
weren&#39;t sure if we needed to pull them off or not.)<br/>
As far and looks and ruby goes, I have 2 ruby bracers and a BS tunic along <br/>
with steel arms and legs and boots. I like the look for a female wood elf. <br/>
Guildmates are still debating what looks best, the wood elf look or the dark <br/>
elf look the guise gives me, hehe. I can live without more ruby, boots being <br/>
about the only piece looks wise that would tempt me.<br/>
<br/>
Safe Travels and Happy hunting,<br/>
