&gt;&gt;&quot;you are about as much of a tank as t.a.f.k.a.Prince is a bouncer&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;you have to learn to stop hitting them and let them beat on the others&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;you have to learn to scrape them onto the real tanks&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;you have to learn to step out of the melee...it&#39;s called &#39;creative<br/>
&gt;&gt;chickenology&#39;&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;GET OUT!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, These are inane, it is NOT the bards job to extricate him or herself,<br/>
&gt;for one simple reason YOU CAN&#39;T. A same level warrior cannot taunt anything<br/>
&gt;off me, not ever. Stopping hitting them does absolutly zip when you are<br/>
&gt;singing a debuff like chains or dennons or god forbid you have lulled them.<br/>
&gt;They will hit you, there is no point in not hitting back.<br/>
&gt;I am in the near perfect group as I have said before. Warrior (3 levels<br/>
&gt;higher), Cleric, Wizard and me the bard.  The cleric keeps me healed, the<br/>
&gt;warrior taunts them off me. But saying I shouldn&#39;t be in there wacking is<br/>
&gt;inane. I can do real damage and so I should be. Tell them to give it up. If<br/>
&gt;they can&#39;t keep you alive it is THEIR shortcoming not yours. My group would<br/>
&gt;really feel it was their fault if I died. THen again, they are good enough<br/>
&gt;that I haven&#39;t died once while hunting with them. *smiles*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;and then there is the famous....<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;SYLLY WEP!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;which was preceeded by...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;you try to punch a aviak harrier but miss...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;hahahaha, I have pulled on more than one occasion with the lute *laughs* I<br/>
&gt;sing lull while I have it then switch in the pause :o)<br/>
