<div id="ygrps-yiv-498587060">Hmm , i am too lazy to look at what stats are for sure , but here is an <br/>
approx list ands i have something like 837 - 840 ac ,,,, i think<br/>
<br/>
Head : imbrued helm (AC - 16) and stats<br/>
neck : polished mithril torque (AC - 7) wis / int<br/>
face: guise of the deciver (AC - 4 ) i think<br/>
ears: opalline earrings ( AC - 2)x2 +5 ,cha each<br/>
<br/>
rings: plat fire opal rings ( ac 5 )x2,  +55hp<br/>
wrist1 : imbrued bracer ( ac 9 ) stats<br/>
wrist2 : hero bracer ( AC 9 ) stats<br/>
arms : imbrued arms ( ac 16... i think ) stats <br/>
shoulder : carnal pauldrons ( ac - 9 ) dex , wis <br/>
chest : imbrued BP ( ac 29 ) stats<br/>
legs : blackend iron ( ac 6 ) the gold and blue look like crap and i guess <br/>
i&#39;m a fashion junkie.<br/>
back : cloak of shadow ( ac 12 ) dex<br/>
boots : imbrued boots ( ac 16 ) stats<br/>
waist : troll hide ( ac 5 ) but i want a TBB <br/>
 primary - 6NB 11 / 25 <br/>
 secondary - martune rapier 8 / 23 <br/>
 ranged - kerran toy ( ac 3 ) agi / runed bone fork <br/>
<br/>
all that added up gives me like i said about 837 ac if i recall , but that <br/>
could be if i put my lambent greaves on , and i wish i had imbrued ones but <br/>
hate seems kinda dull now that kunark is open.<br/>
    As a side note , here is one of my personal little superstitions about <br/>
armor. I always believed that when you put together a suit of armor, its kind <br/>
of like a circuit, i could always swear that when i got all my bronze armor <br/>
at 25 i would take a ton less damage then when i was only missing one piece, <br/>
same with my lambent, i never tested it, but thats always just the way it <br/>
seemed. so while i take less damage with my high ac , i still wonder if i <br/>
would take even less damage if i had imbrued legs. <br/>
but who knows. anyone else noticed this? , or should i go out and rent my <br/>
padded cell now ?<br/>
