<b>Subject:</b> Text history loss when switching screen modes <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016759129">It seems that Verant has inadvertantly screwed bards again...<br/>
<br/>
After the patch last week that added the text wrapping feature (and caused a <br/>
slowdown when switching from full screen to windowed; ie. going into <br/>
inventory, looting, spell book, etc.) the text in my chat history box would <br/>
sometimes disappear.  It would only happen once in a while, however, so it <br/>
was not that big of a deal.<br/>
<br/>
Last night however, we were doing a practice Kaesora raid with mostly guild <br/>
members, and EVERY time I switched from full screen to windowed, my chat <br/>
history text would dissapear.  Someone in my group mentioned that he only <br/>
noticed that problem when grouped with a bard.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll post this same message on Verant&#39;s official message board, not <br/>
that they&#39;ll notice it, but at least it&#39;ll be there.. hehe<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve tweaked mine out to where I&#39;m very comfortable with it.  You can get <br/>
&gt;it at www.clandlc.com/files/eqclient.ini<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are a lot of pastels and light colors in this one, that&#39;s because I <br/>
&gt;play in full screen mode and most&#39;ve the places I play in are dark.  It&#39;s <br/>
&gt;hard to read some of the text in windowed mode, but the text that you have <br/>
&gt;to read in that mode is black (Merchant buy/sells).  I&#39;ve found that in the <br/>
&gt;zones that are lighter or foggy zones (like Burning Woods sometimes), all <br/>
&gt;you have to do to read the text again is toggle on the Transparent Polys (~ <br/>
&gt;key).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to know what some of you all think (and if you have color <br/>
&gt;suggestions, please tell me).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW, anyone else notice their text disappearing when changing from windowed <br/>
&gt;to full-screen mode and vice versa?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Enjoy!<br/>
