<b>Subject:</b> RE: A Request and Thoughts on Rubicite Armor. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422352881">You go on and rant about the worthless threads that have no interest to you<br/>
and complain they are not bard specific and then post about problems with<br/>
Rubicite Armor?    I agree with your early statements about the threads not<br/>
relating to bards, but that also includes Rubicite Armor.  That is not a<br/>
bard topic.  The only way it would be is if that was the only plate armor<br/>
that a bard could wear, which is not the case.  So please do as you ask and<br/>
keep it about bards ;)  Not a flame. <br/>
