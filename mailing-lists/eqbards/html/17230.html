<div id="ygrps-yiv-223098790"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The critical hits are nice, but I tend to consider them as procs.  The<br/>
&gt; Crippling Blow is nice, but my understanding is that Warriors need to be<br/>
&gt; below a certain Health threshold for this to kick in, which they usually<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t stay at (if they&#39;re that low, a healer is gonna be healing them).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that understanding incorrect?  And yes, I&#39;ll concur that monks and rogues<br/>
&gt; are just badasses (I consider them to be the melee version of a nuker).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is incorrect.  Warriors make a crippling blow at any health.  You&#39;re<br/>
thinking of their ATK stat going through the roof (Berzerk) whenever they go<br/>
below 30% of their health.  Thus they hit more often when hurt badly.  But<br/>
the crippling blow is just another kind of crit.  And Warriors crit a LOT<br/>
more regularly than any proc&#39;ing weapon I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>

&gt; Wield/Double Attack (plus Kick, Bash,<br/>
&gt; &gt;Slam, whatever) means that they ALL do significantly more damage than we<br/>
&gt; do.  And don&#39;t even begin to talk<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Incorrect.  At level 34 a Ranger can kick for up to 23 points.  Kick<br/>
recycles about every 10 seconds.  So no, this is incorrect.<br/>

&gt; &gt;about 50% of the melee damage that other hybrids do, and about 25% of the<br/>

&gt; &quot;similar weapons&quot; is not really a<br/>

&gt; 50% of a ranger&#39;s damage is not insignificant in my mind, considering he<br/>
&gt; gets double attack.  Again, though, you used the magic word &quot;estimated.&quot;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m looking for numbers (if you still have the logs around) -- I want to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed, you&#39;re looking for numbers.  But I think we can all pretty much<br/>
agree that we do 50% of the dmg of a normal hybrid in Melee without having<br/>
to crunch numbers.  I mean, why crunch numbers when that&#39;s already pretty<br/>
obvious?<br/>

&gt; significantly augmented groups,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and that they balance this by making them weak soloers, one would like to<br/>

&gt; forms or to break a room.  Also, there are more bards coming of age these<br/>
&gt; days, and a group generally won&#39;t have more than one bard (unlike tanks or<br/>
&gt; casters).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Agreed.  I have no trouble whatsoever getting in groups with my bard.  I<br/>
would hazard to state that I have an easier time getting into groups than<br/>
almost anyone I know.  Even on an extremely crowded server.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to this comparison of Melee dmg.  Why are we comparing our 2nd rate<br/>
dmg method to other hybrid&#39;s 1st rate dmg method?  Our #1 damage producer is<br/>
our songs.  Our songs vastly outdamage any hybrid&#39;s damage curve when used<br/>
correctly.  If I twist CoC, DDD, CoD, NiV with my 50 bard on Test I do<br/>
damage very comparable to what a ranger or paladin or shadowknight of equal<br/>
level can do.  Add to that my ability to regen mana for others, heal others,<br/>
speed others combat up etc.  I&#39;d say that Bards are not nearly as bad off as<br/>
many seem to paint us.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line:  Bards are not a melee class in the classic sense.  Yes, we can<br/>
(and should) get in there and mix it up.  But no, we aren&#39;t meant to be up<br/>
there swinging swords all the time.  90% of the time our songs are our best<br/>
weapons.<br/>
