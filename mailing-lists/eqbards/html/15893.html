<div id="ygrps-yiv-649629634">Ha.  That parallels my guild&#39;s behavior.  We do not roll, the officers<br/>
decide on loot distribution for Planer, Dragon and Gods.  As such we have a<br/>
&quot;wish list&quot; section of our web site where the members post what they would<br/>
*like* to have from those mobs.  The officers then decide distribution based<br/>
upon need, guild seniority, effort/time spent, your wish list, etc.  My wish<br/>
list doesn&#39;t list a Cloak of Flames or Runed Bolster Belt as wish items.  I<br/>
simply don&#39;t do enough damage to deserve one over *any* tank.  I have a FBSS<br/>
and am quite happy until I get my Belt of Concordance.<br/>

&gt; Heheheh, I was thinking - I would take an RBB if it was given to me (we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t do /random with loots, it&#39;s lame imo), but why would I? It would be<br/>
&gt; better suited for the real damage dealers. I&#39;ll just stick it<br/>
&gt; out, and wait<br/>
&gt; until I can score a belt of concordance. This is from the point<br/>
&gt; of view of a<br/>
&gt; bard that groups with the same group/guild/people every night.<br/>

&gt; &gt;How on earth did they let a bard have a runed bolster belt? =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Seriously, being the weakest of the melee classes what sort of dragon<br/>
&gt; &gt;loot system is used that allowed you to be have such an item. Also does<br/>
&gt; &gt;it make you ineligible for Selo&#39;s drum and Horn of War?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A few improvements in your equipment I might add if you dont mind which<br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;re probably already aware of.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Wear Imbrued gloves (assuming you have them), the lambent ones are just<br/>
&gt; &gt;awful looking. If you&#39;re ever able to get a Tranix crown, wear that over<br/>
&gt; &gt;Imbrued (assuming you dont have one). Imbrued helm also looks awful =).<br/>
&gt; &gt;Crested spaulders -better ac and hp, dex useless since your weapons dont<br/>
&gt; &gt;proc. Hooded black cloak if you&#39;re lucky enough to obtain one - the 45<br/>
&gt; &gt;hp outweighs the extra 2 ac on cloak of shadows in my opinion.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Diamondine earrings - 122 charisma is plenty so you can afford to lose<br/>
&gt; &gt;the opallines, especially if you choose Tranix over Imbrued.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m still trying to figure out why your dex is so high. Imbrued BP (13),<br/>
&gt; &gt;bracer (3), Gloves (5), Belt (10), Pauldrons (7 or 9?), Cloak (5). Also<br/>
&gt; &gt;how much hp does the bolster belt give you? I&#39;m assuming roughly 30 hp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Please let me know.<br/>
