<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118407797">I read your post Rokenn.  Lot of good stuff in there.  Hope it keeps getting<br/>
bumoped up to the top of the board.  Thats what prompted me to make this<br/>
suggestion.  We can tell Verant until we are blue in the face that our<br/>
memorization time is ridiculously too long but if we don&#39;t show them the<br/>
actual numbers they will likely blow us off.  We all like to think no one at<br/>
Verant actually plays a bard so if thats true, they don&#39;t know what a pain<br/>
in the arse it is for us.  Would be nice if we had similar data from a 50<br/>
level caster and compare the mem times between 50 bard and 50 caster.<br/>
Anyone play/know a 50 caster they can get the data from (Naeeldar??)?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; It is a great idea. GZ stated a few months ago that he would look into it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is also one of the things in my post on the Sony EQ message board <br/>

&gt; Abashi posted last night that he has a long response from GZ to my post<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; he will be posting it soon.  Hopefully we will see it tonight.....<br/>
