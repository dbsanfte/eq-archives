&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just a minor point, but make sure your druid is using Snare, NOT Ensnare.<br/>
&gt;Snare is a level 1 spell, Ensnare is a level 24/29/34 (forget which)<br/>
&gt;spell. Snare lasts a set time, Ensnare is inferior -- it costs more mana<br/>
&gt;and usually runs out in 3-9 seconds.<br/>

But I have a mid-30s level ranger and can say that my snare works much<br/>
better than a bard&#39;s chain, and if the monster is under the effects of a<br/>
bard&#39;s chain, my snare does not hold.<br/>
<br/>
If it is of vital importance that the monster does not run away, please let<br/>
the druid or ranger snare it - snare is much better that rooting, chaining,<br/>
ensnaring, or anything else for the purpose of not letting a monster flee as<br/>
it is about to die (the other spells are good for other things, but snare is<br/>
BEST for this). Plus, if a creature is rooted and about to die, he will<br/>
still fight, but if he is snared, he&#39;ll turn is back to you and just stand<br/>
there helplessly. =)<br/>
