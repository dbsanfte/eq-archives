<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-789416869">Well I have to respectfully disagree with this idea, I would rather have all<br/>
the songs we already have actually do something and do it the way they are<br/>
supposed to (ha!) than start trying to petition about changing one that at<br/>
least works and does something, even if that something is somewhat rarely<br/>
useful at this time.<br/>
<br/>
I have been and am still concerned about two things:<br/>
<br/>
1) Make our existing songs all work the way they should.  Nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
2) Increase our bad skill caps. I don&#39;t think &quot;master of none&quot; necessarily<br/>
means crummy at most!  All secondary skills should cap somewhere between<br/>
above average and just below Master.  I really think our secondary skills<br/>
should cap at 100, the last point of &quot;Excellent&quot; before you reach &quot;Master&quot;<br/>
and halfway to the 200 &quot;double master&quot; that others get as a cap.<br/>
<br/>
There are many reasons why #2 should really be addressed that we have all<br/>
discovered throughout the course of our playing since Final release and some<br/>
have only become more obvious over time, after other game changes, and as<br/>
more players go beyond their skill caps points in level.<br/>
