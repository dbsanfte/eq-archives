<br/>
I read a post on Fires of Heaven noos board that two of them hit 56 and<br/>
heard rumor that they are being power played 24/7.  They want to be the<br/>
first to hit 60 and do it a.s.a.p.  And playing 24 hours a day for exp will<br/>
definitely get you there.<br/>
<br/>

p.s. also saw some equilizer/stratics posts from miriana&#39;s guild on phat<br/>
l3wt&#39;s they hauled in.  one was the new mask with illusion iskar effect. i<br/>
think stats were the same as mask of deceiver but the illusion is Iskar.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; thanks =)<br/>
&gt; another bard in my guild hit 54 last night.  i&#39;m guessing at least 2 more<br/>
&gt; months for me =/  you level much faster when 2 people are playing shifts<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the character, which is not the case for me anymore.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wasn&#39;t it L51 on your last post?  Heh heh.  Congrats!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bets on when he hits 60 anyone? </span></blockquote></div>
