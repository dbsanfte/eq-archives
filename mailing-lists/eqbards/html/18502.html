<div id="ygrps-yiv-337673522">Yes most definitely.<br/>
Clarity song stacks with itself since it is a direct mana boost and not a<br/>
buff.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Chorus of Clarity Stacking<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to confirm something that I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve read, but haven&#39;t<br/>
been able to confirm from Bard Song Analysis site. This came across last<br/>
night as I was grouped with another bard, which hasn&#39;t happened to me in a<br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>
If there are 2 bards in the group and both are singing Chorus of Clarity,<br/>
is mana recovered faster than if just 1 were singing it? I checked with<br/>
some bards logged on-line last night and received a &quot;no&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot; and a<br/>
&quot;yes, most definitely&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the &quot;no&quot; answer came from a bard who didn&#39;t realize that Anthem<br/>
de Arms was an Atk speed buff, and thought that Whistling Warsong buffed<br/>
the entire party. : ) Man, he needs to read Rokken&#39;s website.<br/>
