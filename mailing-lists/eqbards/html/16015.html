<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910856122">Our guild did some exploring in the Plane of Air - post patch (this weekend<br/>
even)<br/>
<br/>
Friday, we killed a spirited harpy and found:<br/>
<br/>
Belt of Concordance.<br/>
<br/>

A very nice item.  ac 6, str+5 cha+5 sv Poison +5  wt: 0.1 effect: Haste.<br/>
Bard only.<br/>
<br/>
This is a clip from a post made by one of our enchanters:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;almost all the good dropped loot in sky is random off the nameds with a<br/>
small chance of an unnamed mob dropping also. the named mobs (Protector of<br/>
Sky, Gorgalosk, etc..) seem to always drop 1 of the randomly dropped great<br/>
items, along with 1 or 2 rare quest items (gems off PoS, nodrop quest pieces<br/>
off Gorg).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Island 3 is pretty nice - heh, once you get there.  Island 2, the Azarack<br/>
island is kinda tricky.  We got smooshed good learning how.  I wont spoil it<br/>
for those who have not done it - it&#39;s some unexplored territory and that is<br/>
damn rare in Norrath these days.  We saw a very experienced, strong,<br/>
skillful guild make an attempt on Island 2 and get repulsed.  No doubt they<br/>
can do it - just a matter of when they decide to come back.  And we saw a<br/>
&quot;pick-up&quot; group of 25 or so brave adventurer&#39;s give it a shot.  Their basic<br/>
plan was &quot;follow me!&quot; and they got smooshed too.  This zone is an expensive<br/>
place to do CR.  And most pick-up groups don&#39;t have the dedication to &quot;keep<br/>
trying&quot; when a try costs you 220pp or so per person.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of things to learn about agro ranges and pulling techniques<br/>
and, heh, I wont spoil it for any of you here either.<br/>
<br/>
We were also discussing pulling techniques an dthe pitfalls of having the<br/>
bard in with the puller. Our guild uses this technique:<br/>
<br/>
Puller and back-up puller with Feign Death capability go out to fetch.  A<br/>
spotter is also in position.  If the pull is single and clean, the spotter<br/>
calls it out for everyone to hear.  If not (ie too many mobs pulled), the<br/>
puller feigns and the back-up puller tags one as they reset - if he is able.<br/>
Having the spotter out there calling it for everyone, relieves the puller<br/>
from having to type and avoid death at the same time.  Also, the puller is<br/>
not always aware of the extent of agro&#39;d mobs.  We avoid the situation<br/>
someone else described of not knowing what the pull is until it arrives.<br/>
<br/>
When the pull arrives, we have a designated &quot;picker.&quot;  He/she has talked to<br/>
the enchanters and knows which mob-type to select to fight first.  Everyone<br/>
waits until the picker shouts &quot;Target selected - assist me now!&quot;  The picker<br/>
has of course waited for the spotter to call a clean pull and for the<br/>
enchanters to do the crowd control thing.  (Some variations occur depending<br/>
on whether or not the mobs can be mezzed, charmed, or not.)  People have hot<br/>
keys with &quot;/assist anne&quot; and &quot;/assist tuur&quot; for primary and secondary<br/>
pickers.  Having the names in the macro really helps avoid bad assists.<br/>
<br/>
Two good bard things:  some mobs you fight here have AE despell and AE<br/>
stamina drain.  The bard group gets lucky because the songs will refresh and<br/>
that old level 3 Jig o&#39; Vigor is finally valuable. Heh, I have not played<br/>
mine since reaching level 32 &lt;g&gt; well, ok, I do play it some when the tanks<br/>
are swinging the heavy weps in long fights.  Well, these mobs drain all of<br/>
your sta in a few rounds with their sta drain spells.  The other normally<br/>
unused song that works here is Veracious Concord (sp? the see invis song.)<br/>
There are some invis mobs to fight.  And yes, others can cast see invis, but<br/>
when you fight mobs that despell, they need to keep casting while you can<br/>
just be playing it in your song mix.  Although, this is pretty specific to<br/>
certain mobs in a certain plane, it&#39;s one of those times where you feel like<br/>
its great to be a bard and have some tricks up your sleeve.<br/>
<br/>
I really had to work on not getting too much attention from the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A Gorgalask hits YOU for 320!&quot;<br/>
&quot;A Gorgalask hits YOU for 278!&quot;<br/>
&quot;A Gorgalask kicks YOU for 68!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yup, all in one round.  Stop attack, stop song. Back up. Play mana song.<br/>
Wait for a heal. Try again.  One battle was going rather long and we had<br/>
lost some folks and I was feeling like I should get into the battle and do<br/>
something.  I was 2 some bubs down in hp and started to melee. Took a couple<br/>
hard hits and went to go back out.  My guess I got lower HP than all the<br/>
others on hate list and the mob frenzied on me.  Well, at that point it was<br/>
like one more hit for 274 and I was memming songs in Gfay.  Don&#39;t melee<br/>
below full hp or step out before getting under half health.  At least on<br/>
these uber-mobs.  Imho, a dead melee bard is not as much help and the live<br/>
one out of the melee playing mana song for the cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I switched to using my 6 note blade and my dragoon dirk.  I bagged my<br/>
Yk thinking that a) level difference what it is 47 vs 60 no matter what wep<br/>
I use, it wont hit for full effect; b) the Yk 75dd proc gets resisted all<br/>
the time but adds you to the hate list as if it hit for full effect. I guess<br/>
it may have helped some.  The other thing I was doing is playing mana song<br/>
only while in the melee.  That definitely seemed to help - and was<br/>
recommended by my cleric who definitely has a good handle on how to keep me<br/>
alive.  At times, I would stop melee attack and play songs for my tanks -<br/>
berserkers and mystic shielding.  That also helped keep me from getting<br/>
smacked.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I lost about a bub of xp over the course of our expedition and<br/>
took a big hit to the ego (&quot;Welcome back once again to level 47 - have you<br/>
thought about frequent flyer miles?&quot;)  but for some really great times and<br/>
some really great battles with some really great people - and a nice new<br/>
toy - it was definitely worth it.<br/>
