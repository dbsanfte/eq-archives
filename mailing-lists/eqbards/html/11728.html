<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lambent stones, DW staff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421660056">Well, being of the age when I can grab my own lambent stones, I had one<br/>
on eme and a long night of HG hunting was ahead, so I decided to trade<br/>
it in for a Darkwood Staff, to see what is was like and what they would<br/>
sell for.<br/>
<br/>
First, it comes from ROMAR. He is basically on the opposite side of the<br/>
temple from Genni, and down one floor. It&#39;s an even trade, one lambent<br/>
stone, one Darkwood staff. Stats on the staff are:<br/>
<br/>
Darkwood Staff: Magical 1HB, 5/28, Wt6.5, All/All, NOT LORE, NOT NODROP,<br/>
Graphic is same as a cracked staff.<br/>
<br/>
So, the stats aren&#39;t bad, but would only be of intrest for a pure caster<br/>
I think. Druids, Shamen, etc. could get a combine morningstar 8/38,<br/>
which comes out to a much better weapon. Or if they wanted something<br/>
faster, a combine warhammer, 6/30. Comparing it to other weapons, It is<br/>
EXACTLY the same as the Water Crystal Staff, which sells for 85-100pp,<br/>
but is involved in a quest.<br/>
<br/>
I made 2 and sold both for 40pp. This may be why people are not letting<br/>
go of stones so quickly. On the other hand, I watched a high level SK<br/>
kill a SG in Oasis, and immediately after the fight he /told me &quot;stone<br/>
on SG if you want it&quot;. I offered to heal/regen him fo it, he thought it<br/>
was a good trade :).<br/>
