<div id="ygrps-yiv-560169043">I have a couple question about mana song.I have just<br/>
reached 32 level and wanted to know the do`s and dont<br/>
of this song.Does an instrument make it more powerful<br/>
than just singing?Dose twisting with other song effect<br/>
its help of mana recovery? Can it be twisted in battle<br/>
to help mana recovery ?<br/>
Basicly i just want to no what other bards are doing?<br/>
<br/>
    Clarity (L32) is probably the most<br/>
anti-climacticsong you<br/>
    will ever get.  Everyone wants it, you can&#39;t<br/>
waitfor it, and<br/>
    when you finally do get it... nothing.  You<br/>
cannotsee<br/>
    *anything* this song does because it does<br/>
notaffect you in<br/>
    the slightest (except the annoying spam messages).<br/>
All you<br/>
    get are reassurances from anyone who&#39;s not a<br/>
bard,monk,<br/>
    warrior, or rogue, that yes, their mana is<br/>
indeedregenerating<br/>
    faster.  More like a whimper than a bang. <br/>
:-)-------------<br/>
I am sure I will need to carry a towel to deal with<br/>
all the drooling when I reach 32.  I am currently<br/>
carrying a stick to poke those who say &quot;Oh, you&#39;re<br/>
nota mana bard?  =(&quot;.<br/>
