<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452763687">Pretty easy...run around and brusco your attacker to death, dragging him<br/>
like a kite on a string of his affection for you.  It works best with<br/>
mobs who think they can kill you.  Don&#39;t waste it on greens cause once<br/>
they get too damaged they&#39;ll run.  Don&#39;t try it on red guys cause your<br/>
brusco may not work on them but it is great on blues, whites and most<br/>
yellows.  I think it best to do it with things that you will benefit a<br/>
great deal from doing it with cause it is obviously pretty time<br/>
comsuming for just one kill.  I hear some people do it with COD but I am<br/>
not brave enough for that.<br/>

One question...what is kiting and how is it done?  I have seen this a<br/>
lot in<br/>
this group, but I am sorry, I have never heard of it before.<br/>
