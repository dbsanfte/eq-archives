<div id="ygrps-yiv-957176627">I would agree with the assessment that forage is not too low.  And if it&#39;s<br/>
low at all, it&#39;s certainly not too low to be useful.  I think it&#39;s perfect<br/>
for what they intended.  They intended it to be not as good as a full<br/>
fledged forager would have.  I forage way more than enough food, and just<br/>
slightly less than enough water to keep me alive.  So I can forage enough<br/>
berrires and fruit and such to give to my brewing friends, and still have<br/>
plenty of food to eat.  I don&#39;t mind that I have to buy water every so<br/>
often, since characters without forage at all have to do it a lot more<br/>
often.  I think those who think it is useless are either too lazy to press<br/>
the button often enough, or have a case of sour grapes (or is that berries?)<br/>

&gt;&gt;Okay, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far.  Once again a reminder, I&#39;m not looking<br/>
&gt;&gt;to send in an email asking for new features added, just for fixes to current<br/>
&gt;&gt;problems, or at least estimates on when we can expect things to be fixed.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;want answers, not changes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This all looks really good (although I&#39;ll stand by my belief in Forage not<br/>
&gt;being too low).  If no one has any oppositional posts by next week, I say<br/>
&gt;send it.<br/>
