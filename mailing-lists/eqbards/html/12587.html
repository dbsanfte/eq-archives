<div id="ygrps-yiv-851134832">That is the problem I am facing... I have a lvl 50 necro on Veeshan. <br/>
Unfortunatly Veeshan is owned by FoH so dragon runes are not a possibility. <br/>
Both dragons are either Gm slain within 10 mins of server coming up or FoH <br/>
has a group or 18-24 people posted outside the FG and ICE giant area making <br/>
final preps for going in. Only rarely does FoH miss an oppertunity to kill <br/>
the dragons or a god. That&#39;s why I started my bard twink heh. Not much to do <br/>
wwith my necr. BTW off topic, but what are some good lvling areas for a <br/>
semi-twinked (still wanna learn to play the class as intended) lvl 8 bard.<br/>
<br/>
Klayan Deathbringer (The Oracle) lvl 50 Necro<br/>
Celantra (The Oracle) lvl 8 semi-twink Bard<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never said or felt that you were an idiot, but I have noticed in <br/>
&gt;recent<br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks that your attitude toward other players whos level hasn&#39;t caused <br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt; &gt; a nosebleed (under 49 apparently) has deteriorated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Only on dragon raids and plane trips, you&#39;ll notice.  I cannot stress<br/>
&gt;   waiting on dragon raids.  Cause there ain&#39;t nothing else left after you<br/>
&gt;   do them.  Make the level, and then kick back on dragons.  Otherwise,<br/>
&gt;   you aren&#39;t gonna get anything else out of the game.  I&#39;m having great<br/>
&gt;   fun doing dragon planning and raiding planes.  After you make L50,<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve realized that the strain of making levels is lifted, and you can<br/>
&gt;   enjoy the game much more.  Again, that&#39;s my take on it as people<br/>
&gt;   often like to disagree with me.  But there is no excitement after<br/>
&gt;   you&#39;ve done it all, in my opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harm.<br/>
