<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030156949">You&#39;re really close to Rathe Mountain zone. Head there and charm cyclopses <br/>
to fight other clopses or giant skeletons. If you&#39;re really good with <br/>
charm/selo&#39;s you can charm Tarskuk and have him wipe everything out for <br/>
you. But he is faster than normal clops, so you might have to zone if you <br/>
get into trouble.<br/>

&gt;         My bard is 28, and if I have to spend another day running around<br/>
&gt;chickenville in SK looking for Harriers and Avocets during primetime I am<br/>
&gt;going to go nuts.  I enjoy the charming in the outdoors and made it through<br/>
&gt;level 27 and half way in to 28 with out a scratch on me =).  Does anyone<br/>
&gt;know anything outdoors (especially static spawns) that is worth going after<br/>
&gt;at this level using charm?  The chickens were nice because the spawns were<br/>
&gt;static in the village.  I know there is Choon and Froon but they are<br/>
&gt;usually camped.  Though the centuar spawns in the stables are static I<br/>
&gt;found it to be a bit risky. </span></blockquote></div>
