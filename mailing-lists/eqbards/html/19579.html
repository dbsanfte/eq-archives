<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139514982">This announcement is specifically for bards who play on E&#39;ci.<br/>
<br/>
My guild (Disciples of Honor) has several bards who have been working diligently<br/>
on acquiring the coins to complete the tamborine quest.  This weekend we are<br/>
going to attempt to get a complete set of coins for all the bards in the guild<br/>
(plus any bard from outside the guild who participates in the event).  The plan<br/>
is to have groups in all the zones where coins are found and acquire as many<br/>
coins as possible (Kaesora seems to be the toughest one so far).  Once we get<br/>
enough coins then we will move on to another zone.  Sunday night we will meet up<br/>
in FV and distribute the coins we collect to everyone who participates.  If you<br/>
and your guildmates would like to participate send me a private email at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bamadude@...">bamadude@...</a> and I&#39;ll fill you in on the details.  <br/>
