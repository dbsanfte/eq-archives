 </span></blockquote>With your resist songs, you should see about 20% higher<br/>
resists than if you&#39;d used a normal drum.  e.g. if ER raised<br/>
your magic resist by 20 points with a drum, you&#39;d get 24 with<br/>
a Mistmoore drum.  The running speedup is only about 5%-8%<br/>
more than you&#39;d get with a normal drum.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s 20% of<br/>
something, but haven&#39;t a clue what.<br/>
