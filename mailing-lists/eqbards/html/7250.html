I&#39;ve looked through many of your posts and I think I know where your<br/>
problem is.  Your AC is too low.  Are you still wearing that studded<br/>
leather armor?  You were wearing that last week so I would assume that is<br/>
what you did your tests with.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that the (Ogre?) Shaman you fought had an AC only 7 lower<br/>
than you.  You should be way higher than him.  First every piece of armor<br/>
you put on should give you more AC than the Ogre due to your higher AGI.<br/>
And you were using an AC15 shield while the Ogre was using a 2hander.<br/>
Unless this shaman was twinked up, you should have a 50-70 AC advantage.<br/>
<br/>
You should be in full banded at the bare minimum.  2-3 AC points per piece<br/>
really makes a huge difference.  Note there is a hidden multipler based on<br/>
your Agility.  So that 2-3 points can turn into 3-5 points per piece.  You<br/>
could easily boost your AC by 50 by switching to full banded.<br/>
<br/>
Also get a few pieces of Bronze.  You should be looking for small Bronze<br/>
and there should be plenty of that.  Get a few pieces depending on what<br/>
your STR can bear.  Bronze is heavy, but the AC is well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
You said your STR was 87, 17 above the baseline.  You should have put more<br/>
of your starting 25 into STR, but we can&#39;t change that now.  To carry the<br/>
Bronze, you need to get some +STR items.  Buy some +3 STR rings.  You can<br/>
get a Purity Belt (+2 STR) for under 5pp.  You also may want to consider<br/>
the Cracked Darkwood Shield (+9STR).  There are many more items to choose<br/>
from.  Once you pass the Bronze Era and start getting better, lighter armor<br/>
(Ruby for example), you can start switching out the +STR items for better<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Other hints would include don&#39;t use backpacks.  They are 3 lbs each.  Use<br/>
large sacks or something lighter.  Destroy heavy rusty weapons and other<br/>
heavy loot.  Sell often.  If your group is medding, quickly Selo over to<br/>
the neaest vendor and unload.<br/>
<br/>
You will be very suprised at the amount of damage reduction a higher AC<br/>
will produce.  Try equiping yourself as a normal bard of your level and<br/>
then duel the shaman.  You will win easily.<br/>
