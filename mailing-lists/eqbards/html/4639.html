<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265467778"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; well... there is one way around no drop. If<br/>
&gt; someone in your party loots something that<br/>
&gt; they cant use but you can, duel them for it,<br/>
&gt; tell them to let you win, you can loot the<br/>
&gt; item from their corpse afterwards. and they<br/>
&gt; dont lose xp because its a duel<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate to break off topic here for a minute, but can someone explain (or<br/>
point to a web page that does) dueling in more detail? I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>
scrap up the details about how it works but haven&#39;t been successful. My<br/>
questions are:<br/>
<br/>
1. When the person that loses dies, do they go back to where they&#39;re bound?<br/>
2. Is it true that whoever wins the duel can loot items off of your body?<br/>
3. Is there any way to cancel a duel after both people have accepted the<br/>
duel?<br/>
4. Is it against Verant&#39;s rules to have outsiders buff a player while he/she<br/>
is dueling? (I wouldn&#39;t do this, but I&#39;d worry about the person I&#39;m dueling<br/>
doing it)<br/>
5b. If you&#39;re in a group with another Bard and you&#39;re dueling, will their<br/>
songs affect you during the duel?<br/>
6. If you&#39;re dueling in a PVP area, can other people enter the fight?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and sorry if these have been covered before.</div>
