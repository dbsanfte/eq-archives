I&#39;ve been wondering how to do this.  Those helms are a bitch for a level 36<br/>
like myself that doesn&#39;t have a bunch of chummy level 50 friends.  I&#39;ve<br/>
tried to talk pickup groups in Oasis into pulling those things before (some<br/>
with high 40s players in them) and they&#39;ve all laughed at me.  :(  I would<br/>
argue that due to circumstances that the helm is more difficult than the BP.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Unlucky I guess, almost all the other items were under 30 minutes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I still need both items for the helmet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The helmet ugh.  Mudwater rune, piece of cake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Opoline Helm...  deepwater goblins are mostly L38 (they almost always<br/>
&gt;   give exp to L50 players).  For those of you who don&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt;   helmet, or don&#39;t know how in the world you can beat up one of these<br/>
&gt;   critters, or don&#39;t know how to pull these guys...  this is for you:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   NOTE: I have been slain in 4 casts from a deepwater goblin.<br/>
&gt;         It took 3 casts to kill my L50 shaman friend.  Do not<br/>
&gt;         underestimate the power of these casters.  ~350 dmg per cast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   How to pull these puppies... (you need a druid for this)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   First of all, don&#39;t do it in Oasis.  I had spectres roaming all<br/>
&gt;   around when I first tried to go out there and grab a few.  You<br/>
&gt;   really need to do this in Lake Rathe at the Rathe Mountains zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Secondly, you cannot cast on things under the water.  Things in<br/>
&gt;   the water can cast on you.  Here&#39;s the catch, they wont.  At least<br/>
&gt;   you hope =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Four deepwater goblins can be tracked between the dock at Rathe<br/>
&gt;   Mts and that tower with the blue flame.  If you aren&#39;t L35 yet,<br/>
&gt;   get a ranger/druid to show you where his/her tracking takes them.<br/>
&gt;   You&#39;ll find it&#39;s in the middle of the water, but with full clipping<br/>
&gt;   plane you can still see the dock near Rathe Mts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You cannot pull these goblins separately, its all or nothing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Ok, now the fun part:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   * Get SoW from druid.<br/>
&gt;   * Get Levitate from druid.<br/>
&gt;   * Get druid to show you where the goblins are, and you hover there<br/>
&gt;     while he returns to the zoneline.<br/>
&gt;   * Once druid&#39;s in place, start your strongest magic resist song.<br/>
&gt;     Elemental, Guardian, Mystical... whichever.<br/>
&gt;   * Now, the Z-axis is your friend here... dip into the water a<br/>
&gt;     little and start your favorite AE song.<br/>
&gt;   * Once you do this you must _get out_ of the water asap, and<br/>
&gt;     haul ass back to the zoneline for Rathe Mountains.<br/>
&gt;   * You may take residual dmg.  But most deepwaters will not<br/>
&gt;     cast underwater.  They prefer to shoot arrows at you.<br/>
&gt;   * Reach the zoneline and wait, since we are playing on the<br/>
&gt;     Z-axis here, you will instantly get attacked and see nothing.<br/>
&gt;     The goblins will be _below_ the ground plane... Move around<br/>
&gt;     a little and try to force them to move up onto your level.<br/>
&gt;   * Druid then immediately snares one deepwater, and you both<br/>
&gt;     _must_ zone.<br/>
&gt;   * As soon as you appear on the Rathe Mountains side, have druid<br/>
&gt;     quickly heal all dmg, and then rezone asap.<br/>
&gt;   * The three other goblins are now back at their spawn point,<br/>
&gt;     and one snared goblin is trying to return or is hanging around.<br/>
&gt;     Find him returning to the dock, and begin battle.  Interrupt<br/>
&gt;     him as much as you can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    This is the safest way to break the deepwater spawn, that I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;    found.  Sound cheesy, maybe it kinda is.  But four deepwaters<br/>
&gt;    is suicide for any player.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Harmonic.<br/>
