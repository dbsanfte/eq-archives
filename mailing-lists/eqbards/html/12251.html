	Disregard the thing on a brass song at level 11. The original was a singing<br/>
song called Agitato&#39;s Taunting Tune that would effectively do a taunt on the<br/>
target. A bard song that taunts the target. Wow, isn&#39;t that totally useful.<br/>
How many songs do we have that do that. 15? 20? No wonder they took it out.<br/>

	I think the reason we got brass at level 11 is because the current song for<br/>
level 11 isn&#39;t the original. For the life of me I can&#39;t remember what the<br/>
old one back in Beta4 was but I think it might have been a brass song.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I just hit lvl 11 and got my brass skill.  Am I wrong when I look at the<br/>
 song list, or is the first song I can use this for at lvl 18?  Is there<br/>
 anyway to practice it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nope your right. And nope there isnt. When I saw this I didnt train my brass<br/>
skill until I got my 18th song. This gave me a lil boost in the skill as I<br/>
started at 90 instead of 55 skill.  A few less missed notes in the long run<br/>
