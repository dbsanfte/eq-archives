<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010071785">Not so certain if I like the sound of this.  While Verant may classify<br/>
increasing the range an &quot;improvement&quot;, I had no problem with the effect<br/>
radius of the song as it was.  The radius of the song has always been large<br/>
enough to allow binding of all the mobs in the general vicinity of where I&#39;m<br/>
fighting at.  I sure as hell don&#39;t want to aggro additional mobs that my<br/>
group isn&#39;t fighting.  It may not be that big a deal in outside zones but in<br/>
dungeons this could turn out to be nasty (assuming z-axis bug is still in<br/>
effect for bard songs).  Anyone know if this song will aggro mobs through<br/>
walls in a dungeon?<br/>

Largo&#39;s: Range has been increased. Changes are live. Still looking into PvP<br/>
behavior.</div>
