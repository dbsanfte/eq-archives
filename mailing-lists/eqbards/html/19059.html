<div id="ygrps-yiv-956701480">i think you are supposed to give him stuff all at once.  i&#39;ve done both these<br/>
quests, altho quite a while ago.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;And finally,  I spent some time cleaning out the bank account.  Decided to<br/>
&gt;go do the crafted armor quest with a griffon eye.  Bought 2 Fire Emeralds in<br/>
&gt;FV and teleported to NK.  Went to see the Centies and even made him tell me<br/>
&gt;about the quest.  But when I gave him the stuff, he gave me the &quot;aren&#39;t you<br/>
&gt;forgetting something&quot; for the eye (which I expected) and then nothing for<br/>
&gt;the gems.  Sheesh.  This is the 2nd time in a month that I have failed doing<br/>
&gt;crafted armor quest.  Other one was for crafted bp - lost the werewolf talon<br/>
&gt;and rubys. Grrrr.  Of course, I petitioned and was told &quot;sorry, can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;replace items... send email to ...&quot;  Anyone else know anything about the<br/>
&gt;crafted armor being bugged somehow?<br/>
