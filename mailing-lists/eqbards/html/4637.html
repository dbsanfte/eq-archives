<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237815096">Hatar was the 1st Sand Giant I and a group of other people MY level ever<br/>
killed. I was 20th I believe at the time. I had been in on other giant<br/>
kills, but with level 30 friends, so this was sort of a milestone. He did<br/>
have the Turban, but I dont remember it being non-visible. I thought it<br/>
showed up as a plate helm on the Troll who got it. Anyway Hatar is a fairly<br/>
rare spawn in Oasis cons white at 20th, and we had a really tough time<br/>
killing him with a full party of 18-20&#39;s. He hit as hard as a regular Giant<br/>
at the time. I dont think he could even hit me anymore at level 34. The odd<br/>
thing is he is the only Giant I have found who drops anything worth a rip.<br/>

There is an item on the EQ&#39;Lizer equipment list called a &quot;Fine Silk Turban -<br/>
This turban is found on Hatar a level 20ish sand giant who occasionally<br/>
spawns in the desert area&#39;s of Oasis and Ro&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This item gives AC10, fire resist +10, and weighs 0.3 - seems to me an ideal<br/>
head item for bards because it does not show up as a graphic on your<br/>
character, just makes you appear like you are not wearing anything on your<br/>
head.  I would love to wear this as I think it would fit with my character&#39;s<br/>
image, but I have never actually heard of or seen one in the game...anyone<br/>
have any more information on this?<br/>
