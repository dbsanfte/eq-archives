Please bump it so we can be sure Verant sees it and gets it<br/>
fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby (bard L16 song) is not working as GZ stated it should<br/>
during his Lullaby test.  The relevant portions of that test<br/>
are quoted below:<br/>
<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:24:14 2000] Geoff says, &#39;K - sounds like a display message error then&#39;<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:24:32 2000] Sbasii says, &#39;how often should the resist be?&#39;<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:24:35 2000] Geoff says, &#39;yea - it should save about 25% of the time at that level difference&#39;<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:24:39 2000] Geoff says, &#39;35% on a white&#39;<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:24:44 2000] Geoff says, &#39;less for high chr&#39;<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:24:55 2000] Nindars says, &#39;so how does that compare to enchanter mez?&#39;<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:24:55 2000] Harli says, &#39;GZ:So CHR should reduce the 25/35?&#39;<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:24:58 2000] Geoff says, &#39;yep&#39;<br/>
[Wed Jan 12 01:25:04 2000] Geoff says, &#39;about the same as mes&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The above percentages refer to a second resist chance mobs<br/>
have against Lullaby.  Mobs have two chances to resist<br/>
Lullaby:<br/>
<br/>
A success on the first chance to save has always generated a<br/>
resist message in red (&quot;Your target resisted the Kelin&#39;s Lucid<br/>
Lullaby spell&quot;).  I denote this as &#39;R&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
A failure on the first chance to save generates a &quot;&lt;target&gt;&#39;s<br/>
head nods&quot; message, and a second save check.  Please move this<br/>
message to after a failure on the second save check to cut<br/>
down on spam.<br/>
<br/>
A success on the second chance to save was not being sent to<br/>
our clients.  This was fixed in a recent patch, and now<br/>
produces the message, &quot;Your target has resisted your attempt<br/>
to mesmerize it&quot; in blue.  (Please make this message red. :) )  <br/>
I denote this as &#39;r&#39;.  Based on GZ&#39;s statements above, mobs<br/>
that are the same level as the bard should be succeeding at<br/>
this second save 35% of the time, less for higher charisma.  <br/>
For large level spreads (level 1 vs. level 35 in the above<br/>
quoted test), the success rate should be 25%, less for higher<br/>
charisma.<br/>
<br/>
If the mob fails both first and second chances to resist, the<br/>
song succeeds and the mob is mesmerized for about 6 seconds.  <br/>
I denote this as &#39;N&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I ran some tests and culled the results out of my logfiles<br/>
(which I can email to anyone at Verant).  My bard was level 45<br/>
during these tests, her charisma was 154, and she had a lute<br/>
equipped all times except for one test.<br/>
<br/>
The first test was when my group derailed a train at the<br/>
Mistmoore zone.  All the mobs were low blue to green - L20-L35<br/>
for the most part.  I only got experience for 4 of the mobs:<br/>
<br/>
18N (43%) | 22r (52%) | 2R (5%)  | 42 total  dark ritualist pets (3)<br/>
13N (45%) | 14r (48%) | 2R (7%)  | 29 total  dark ritualist (3)<br/>
13N (54%) | 11r (46%) | 0R (0%)  | 24 total  dark offerer pet<br/>
 7N (47%) |  8r (53%) | 0R (0%)  | 15 total  dark offerer<br/>
 7N (27%) | 18r (69%) | 1R (4%)  | 26 total  shadowy scribe<br/>
 3N (33%) |  6r (67%) | 0R (0%)  |  9 total  flouting gargoyle<br/>
 1N (33%) |  1r (33%) | 1R (33%) |  3 total  leering gargoyle<br/>
19N (42%) | 23r (51%) | 3R (7%)  | 45 total  glyped sentries (3)<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
81N (42%) | 103r (53%)| 9R (5%)  | 193 total<br/>
<br/>
The second battery of tests were against level ~4 snakes in<br/>
Butcherblock:<br/>
<br/>
242N (58.3%) | 163r (39.3%) | 10R (2.4%) | 415 total [154 charisma]<br/>
428N (61.1%) | 245r (35.0%) | 27R (3.9%) | 700 total [154 charisma]<br/>
291N (63.3%) | 156r (33.9%) | 13R (2.8%) | 460 total [80 charisma]<br/>
418N (64.5%) | 212r (32.7%) | 18R (2.8%) | 648 total [110 charisma]<br/>
452N (65.7%) | 215r (31.1%) | 21R (3.1%) | 688 total [154 charisma]<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the sample still had a variability of a few percent, I<br/>
ran a third set of tests:<br/>
<br/>
2105N (63.3%) | 1145r (34.4%) | 77R (2.3%)  | 3327 total [154 charisma]<br/>
2325N (63.9%) | 1211r (33.3%) | 101R (2.8%) | 3637 total [110 charisma]<br/>
2081N (63.5%) | 1089r (33.3%) | 105R (3.2%) | 3275 total [110 charisma, no lute]<br/>
<br/>
Total for all the snake tests:<br/>
<br/>
8342N (63.4%) | 4436r (33.7%) | 372R (2.8%) | 13150 total<br/>
<br/>
I ran some more tests on other low level mobs just to make<br/>
sure there was nothing &quot;special&quot; about the Butcherblock<br/>
snakes:<br/>
<br/>
421N (63.8%) | 222r (33.6%) | 17R (2.6%) | 660 total - Deathfish Pawns<br/>
323N (64.6%) | 164r (32.8%) | 13R (2.6%) | 500 total - large rats<br/>
425N (63.7%) | 223r (33.4%) | 19R (2.8%) | 667 total - bats<br/>
512N (62.7%) | 280r (34.3%) | 24R (2.9%) | 816 total - stonesnakes<br/>
<br/>
Points that need to be addressed:<br/>
<br/>
- These level 1-4 mobs are succeeding at their secondary<br/>
resists (34.7% success rate after you factor out the primary<br/>
resists) at about the 35% rate GZ stated I should be getting<br/>
at 75 charisma against level 45 mobs.  Please investigate and<br/>
fix it.  It&#39;s possible the same bug is affecting Pixie Strike,<br/>
as a lot of bards started complaining about PS being broken<br/>
about the same time as they started complaining about Lullaby<br/>
not working.<br/>
<br/>
- More substantial (high green to low blue) mobs seem to be<br/>
resisting at higher than 50%.  I assume this is due to the<br/>
same bug as with level 1-4 mobs.  With a 35% to 50%+ resist<br/>
rate against blue/green mobs, and apparently a 70% resist rate<br/>
against mid-blue mobs, you can see why bards have been<br/>
complaining so loudly about this song being broken.<br/>
<br/>
- Why isn&#39;t my charisma having any statistically significant<br/>
effect?<br/>
<br/>
- Why isn&#39;t the lute having any statistically significant<br/>
effect when Lullaby is listed as a string song?<br/>
<br/>
- An apology.  Bards have been complaining about this song<br/>
being broken for months.  We were always brushed off with<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s working as designed.&quot;  Obviously it isn&#39;t.<br/>
