&gt;&gt;or herself, for one simple reason YOU CAN&#39;T. A same level warrior<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then it&#39;s time to find a new warrior, because the one you are<br/>
&gt;grouping with sucks.  Tell them to learn how to click the Taunt<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, a warrior can taunt anything - but it might not work! :)<br/>
<br/>
Taunt works very well - especially a high level warrior&#39;s taunt - but it<br/>
does not work in all situations.<br/>
<br/>
- If you just did something to make the mob very upset (big damage spell,<br/>
big heal, charm, root, snare) it can be VERY hard to taunt it off.<br/>
- If you are low on health and the mob smells a kill - it is almost<br/>
impossible to taunt them off<br/>
<br/>
In addition to my bard I have a level 32 Ranger, and at this level my<br/>
Ranger&#39;s taunt is about the same as a warrior&#39;s of equal level. And I can<br/>
tell you that, especially if the person&#39;s health is low, it can be VERY VERY<br/>
hard to get the mob off of them. As a Ranger I resort to all kinds of<br/>
tricks, like casting a flurry of spells (root, snare, ignite, swarm) which<br/>
generally helps a LOT more than just a taunt to pull off a mob. In that<br/>
respect a warrior - who has ONLY taunt - can possibily be less effective<br/>
than a Ranger.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that if you want to get the mob off you, you also need to do some<br/>
things to help the tanks:<br/>
<br/>
1. Stop doing whatever you were doing. (If you were casting an area effect<br/>
song which frenzied the mob onto you, STOP that song until the tank gets the<br/>
mobs off you)<br/>
2. Stop attacking or doing damage to the mob altogether. In most situations,<br/>
if you are not about to die, a mob will forget about you in a few rounds if<br/>
you&#39;re not attacking and others are (though, if he&#39;s REALLY mad at you -<br/>
like if you charmed him - it might take a little longer.)<br/>
3. Take a FEW steps back, and see if the mob turns. If he does not turn,<br/>
that means he&#39;s frenzied on you, and it could take a few rounds of no<br/>
attacking on your part for the tanks to get him off you. Do NOT run away<br/>
though! If you run away you will force the tanks to chase after you and the<br/>
mob, and the mob will go out of taunting range, and the tank needs to be<br/>
VERY close to be able to taunt.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps =)<br/>
