<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606749527">Has anyone else noticed anything screwy since the last patch?  I&#39;m not talking songs being out of whack or anything to that effect.  I had only had one crash to the desktop in the whole time I&#39;ve been playing.  Since the last patch, I&#39;ve locked up on the login screen 5 times and crashed completely twice -- each one requiring a reboot.  I haven&#39;t installed anything since then or even prior to the patch so I was just seeing if anyone else was experiencing the same sort of thing.  <br/>

    On the other hand though, the random number generator seems to have taken a liking to me last night.  I was camping the goblin foreman in SolA for some quick cash.  We were there 2 hours and the foreman (20 min spawn) spawned 4 out of the six times we were there.  Every time he had an obsidian scimitar!   6 spawns, 4 foremen, 4 OS&#39;s -- too bad we had a druid with us that was in dire need of a tunic.....but I&#39;m not complaining =)<br/>
