<div id="ygrps-yiv-552820584">It may be that fact that many named mobs are much tougher then there levels. <br/>
  Try it against non-named blue creatures, and even then not all mobs are <br/>
created equal.<br/>

&gt;Okay, my brass and strings skills are maxed out, so that should not be a<br/>
&gt;problem.<br/>
&gt;I was trying the &quot;all songs&quot; concept, and it DOESN&#39;T WORK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just for safety, I was in Splitpaw, where there are only 3 things that will<br/>
&gt;attack me: Ghanex Drah, his pet and the occasional wandering zombie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Welp....<br/>
&gt;1st round:  with weapons, I barely killed Ghanex, half killed his pet, then<br/>
&gt;died.<br/>
&gt;2nd round. with weapons, I barely killed Ghanex, did hardly anything to his<br/>
&gt;pet, then died.<br/>
&gt;3rd round. songs only, I didn&#39;t do half health to Ghanex.  WHY?!!?!<br/>
&gt;I was weaving DDD with brass, and Chords and Hymn on strings, but still, he<br/>
&gt;barely took any damage.<br/>
&gt;Why did I lose a level on this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Talies the 19th level again. (and rapidly going downward as he tries again<br/>
&gt;and again to retrieve his corpse)<br/>
