<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048729966">Woot!  Way to go!  Nice one!!<br/>
<br/>
I will always remember my first Nagafen - it was New Year&#39;s Eve &#39;99 - we won<br/>
=) I may have gotten my Selo&#39;s Drums that night - or perhaps sometime after.<br/>
I fell in the lava 2 times.  First time fell off the big ramp and clutched<br/>
to the wall while they killed some fire giants.  I yelled for help and was<br/>
amazed to see one of our rangers jump in and swimm in the lava to come get<br/>
me.  My previous lava experience had been in Sol-A (15 levels lower) where I<br/>
died very fast. He showed me how to swim out.  A bit later, I fell in again<br/>
and swam out myself.  Several Naggy runs later, Naggy fell in the lava and<br/>
we had to jump in to finish him off!  Someone also dove in and looted him<br/>
under-lava!<br/>
<br/>
So grats!  Nice to see you enjoy a really fun part!!<br/>

Well I was bored last night, playing my warrior twink (I will only play<br/>
Elfson with guildies and for big raids now that he is 47), and I get a tell<br/>
that a group has cleared the fire giants but has decided they are a bit weak<br/>
to drop Naggy, so &quot;How fast can you get your blue butt up to SolB?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Woohoo!  My first dragon run!<br/>
<br/>
They were pretty experienced at this, so things went very smoothly (one<br/>
melee group bit it when their bard went down), and he dropped very quickly<br/>
(or so it seemed to me).  I was in the xp group, which is a nice bonus...<br/>
<br/>
He even dropped his drum, which was given (deservedly so) to ther other bard<br/>
there who had been on several Naggy raids in the past.<br/>
<br/>
My original EQ goal has been accomplished!</div>
