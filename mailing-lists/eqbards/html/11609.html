<b>Subject:</b> RE: Pixie/Lullaby theory (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-100041587">I think the part of the code that is not working in Pixie is the same as in<br/>
Lullaby.  The stun affect isn&#39;t getting applied consistently, but the other<br/>
effect is.  Perhaps the stun has a duration of 0-6 seconds.  Pretty silly if<br/>
that&#39;s the case.  Although from the testing I did, the effect was either<br/>
full duration or 0 duration.  nothing in between.  I think that makes it<br/>
pretty obvious that either there&#39;s a bug that occurs, or it was a purposeful<br/>
nerf to have it only stun mobs 80% of the time.<br/>

  in the Arena on myself after I died.<br/>
<br/>
  I couldn&#39;t find any pattern to when the song would and would not work,<br/>
  but most of the time this is what happened (based on the messages<br/>
  I recall, forget the exact wording).<br/>
<br/>
  You begin to send forth music. (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>
  You are stunned.               (0 sec)<br/>
  Your song ends.                (0 sec)<br/>
  Your song ends.                (0 sec)<br/>
  You are unstunned.             (6 sec)<br/>
  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>
<br/>
  And again:<br/>
<br/>
  You begin to send forth music. (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>
  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>
  <br/>
  And again:<br/>
  <br/>
  You being to send forth music  (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>
  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>
<br/>
  This time I let the icon fade away first:<br/>
<br/>
  You being to send forth music  (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>
  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>
<br/>
  Then I let it fade again:<br/>
<br/>
  You begin to send forth music. (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>
  You are stunned.               (0 sec)<br/>
  Your song ends.                (0 sec)<br/>
  Your song ends.                (0 sec)<br/>
  You are unstunned.             (6 sec)<br/>
  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s really weird.  I cannot explain the circumstances when I <br/>
  actually take the song hit, but dont take the stun with it.<br/>
  The song does always drop MR when not resisted, it just doesn&#39;t<br/>
  always send the stun component in.  Also I wish Verant would<br/>
  change the song fade message to:  You stop sending forth music<br/>
  instead of You are no longer stunned.  Because it&#39;s simply not<br/>
  the case.  It&#39;s purely text message, and does not indicate anything<br/>
  other than the fact that the song effects are done.  You can break<br/>
  the stun earlier than the full duration and often do.<br/>
<br/>
  Since Pixie and Lullaby are so closely tied together in their<br/>
  effective impact (stuns a creature) - I am willing to bet there<br/>
  was an indirect change a month or so ago which is propagating <br/>
  false signals to the objects stun code.  (As it stands now, <br/>
  both in PvP, against oneself, and against NPCs the effect is<br/>
  universal - song skill check rolls success, yet the stun is<br/>
  not accepted by the object)<br/>
<br/>
  Since Verant was looking for LPmud coders, I&#39;m guessing that<br/>
  a lot of their structure is built up upon that model.  I coded<br/>
  on an LPmud for 2 years, both object and area design.  And even<br/>
  some of the base models, like player and monster.<br/>
   <br/>
  This may be just a wild guessing (read: warning techie lingo coming)<br/>
<br/>
  But when you target someone for Pixie Strike.  I would imagine you<br/>
  are picking up the object (player or npc) at that time.  When you<br/>
  begin to sing the song, the server does its basic checking.  Are <br/>
  you in range of the target coords?  If so, is this a valid target?<br/>
  And did the target save vs. your song?  At that point, I&#39;m guessing<br/>
  several things can happen, but most likely:<br/>
<br/>
  The server sends you info back saying:  Target didnt resist.  To<br/>
  which your client finds the appropriate message to display from<br/>
  your spell data file.  And then the server processes the target<br/>
  in order to make the effect happen.  In our case, our target <br/>
  must have some variable in the object class for being <br/>
  stunned.  And the attack and movement methods in the object<br/>
  are setup such that [ if (stunned) return; ]  Basically, if <br/>
  I (the object) am stunned, then don&#39;t perform this action.<br/>
  Then internally the object has a timer on the stun, which<br/>
  it counts down periodically.<br/>
<br/>
  If you try this on yourself, clearly the server is not correctly<br/>
  giving you the stun &#39;command&#39; whatever it may be.  I first thought, <br/>
  maybe the server is in fact telling the object it is stunned<br/>
  but expiring it so quickly that nothing happens.  But wouldn&#39;t<br/>
  you see:  You are stunned.  You are unstunned.  at the same <br/>
  time?  I would think so.  Or maybe telling an object to stun<br/>
  for 0 seconds is just skipped since a 0 second stun is obsolete.<br/>
  That could be, then no messages would display.  But that&#39;s if<br/>
  the coded it in said way.<br/>
<br/>
  target-&gt;stun(0);   // send target stun for 0 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
  ------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
  private int stunned;<br/>
<br/>
  void function stun(int duration)<br/>
  {<br/>
     if (stunned)   return;  // already stunned, skip.<br/>
     if (!duration) return;  // no duration?, skip.<br/>
<br/>
     stunned = duration;<br/>
  }<br/>
<br/>
  Errr, damn hehe... I&#39;ve got _real_ work to do =)<br/>
  Sorry for the massive brain dump.<br/>
