<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010146848">I think a lot of classes think they are &quot;most ingnored&quot;. I think however if<br/>
we don&#39;t get a lot of &quot;attention&quot; it is because  we are one of the most<br/>
balanced classes in the game, that really need not a lot of effort to<br/>
balance us out. I could see more magic instruments, but I could also see<br/>
that making us too powerful in unintended ways, leading to nerfing, leading<br/>
to screw-ups, etc. No, I don&#39;t think we need a bunch of new equiptment, as<br/>
it complicates what is to my mind a a fairly balanced equasion. I hope they<br/>
are careful with the changes that are coming to the test center (class<br/>
specific quest-only weapons) because in the long run balance is WAY more<br/>
important than goodies.<br/>
