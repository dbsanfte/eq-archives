I thought that since she was sitting down to Meditate, the skelly would<br/>
automatically aggro her?  When I&#39;ve been memorising songs in a newbie area,<br/>
the greenest of the greens will still attack me because I&#39;m sitting down.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I don&#39;t have anything to add as a potential strategy.<br/>

&gt; &gt;My level 14 rogue is engaged in a virtual duel via email with a level 45<br/>
&gt; &gt;wizard.  She&#39;s not out to kill me, just to get an item back.  Currently<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;immobilized and she&#39;s sitting a little ways in front of me medding.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My thought was to shoot an arrow and a skeleton that just spawned behind<br/>
&gt; &gt;her, then evade and hope that it would attack the medding 45 wizard in<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;path before continuing on to me.  (I want it to stun her so I can flee<br/>
&gt; &gt;before she gets another root off)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What are the chances something like this would work in-game?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Probably not, since in order for a monster to switch targets, it needs to<br/>
&gt;have distance issues.  If you can&#39;t move farther from the wizard, that<br/>
&gt;skelly will just ignore her and move on to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;FYI 14 vs 45 - just give her the darn thing back.<br/>
