&gt; Starts out we gather in guildsay, LoD (other guild) is doing Naggy, Mystical<br/>
&gt; Legends and Storm are gonna give Voxy a shot, some others (not in our guild)<br/>
&gt; are heading back to PoH but most of our high levels are licking xp wounds<br/>
&gt; their 3 days in PoH so they opt for some xp runs meanwhile a group from our<br/>
&gt; guild is camping the King on the Live side of Guk.  &quot;Hey Sylly, wanna do<br/>
&gt; bugs and bats with us?&quot;  Sure!  Love to!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So we go in and clear from the 2nd bat room all the way back to the Sol-a<br/>
&gt; zone. (TBH - lotta stuff was cleared by the dragon raider and a prior group<br/>
&gt; that got trained out so the spawn was pretty light.)  We have a really hairy<br/>
&gt; fight when an LDC breaks snare and scampers off. We chase him and he agros a<br/>
&gt; second LDC. We get lo mana and lo hp but prevail even when one of the party<br/>
&gt; was LD (link dead).  After that the bug and bat spawn is real slow and a<br/>
&gt; call for help doing CR in Lower Live Guk comes across guildsay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We teleport out and go down to Guk and start CR at the zone to the live side<br/>
&gt; from upper.  We clear some, rez some, drag some more - a whole party of six<br/>
&gt; got swarmed and a couple others were uncamping from the server crash into<br/>
&gt; fully populated rooms.  Eventually things got cleaned up and it was right<br/>
&gt; before midnight.  Then a shout goes out in the zone &quot;Lord room is free if<br/>
&gt; you want it!&quot;  And Necralia - our 50 necro decides she wants to solo the<br/>
&gt; Lord - hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So our guild leader says - heck,  we can come too and down we go.  Invised<br/>
&gt; and chasin&#39; them across the live side.  Seeing places I&#39;ve died before and<br/>
&gt; new ones I am sure I will soon know lots better.  Scootch past the basalts<br/>
&gt; and hop down by the 3 froogys on the ledge and off to the Lord room.  Hmm,<br/>
&gt; smaller than I was expecting and not what I woulda chose for wall paper but<br/>
&gt; oh well - hehe I have arrived!  I am camping the Lord!!! Just little old me<br/>
&gt; 40 Bardette, 50 Necro-ette, 50 Wiz, 50 Enchanter, 49 Cleric.  OMG!! I am the<br/>
&gt; only tank! Well, ok Necralia&#39;s pet is a dual wielding maniac and our<br/>
&gt; enchanter&#39;s pet is no slouch either ;p<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not 15 minutes into the camp, a froogy spawns in the room and he&#39;s got<br/>
&gt; weapon in his hand.  Hmm, lots shorter than I was expecting - you&#39;d think a<br/>
&gt; Lord would be taller?  Anyhow he dies real fast - hehe. (You bet I was<br/>
&gt; chaining him NON-STOP - that little sucker is NOT leaving this room!!!)  And<br/>
&gt; they loot the froogy and check the list of who needs what and my trade<br/>
&gt; window opens: &quot;Here Sylly, try this!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So that&#39;s how I got my Yk!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>
&gt; &lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bard of the 40th song<br/>
&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. LoD spanked Naggy - SOL-B is horrible with 70 plus in the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s.s. ML and Storm got spanked by Voxxy and yielded the camp to LoD by<br/>
&gt; prior agreement on a certain time.  LoD prolly got Voxxy and Naggy in the<br/>
&gt; same night.<br/>
