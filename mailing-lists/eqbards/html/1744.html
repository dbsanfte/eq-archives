&gt; &gt;Early Platemail was cast from Iron,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, it was not cast, not even the bronze plate of the ancient Greeks was<br/>
&gt; cast. It was hammered and<br/>
&gt; reasonably light (the leather and scale suit I used to fight in was about<br/>
&gt; 60 lbs plate actually can<br/>
&gt; be lighter and being distributed evenly over your body is a HECK of a lot<br/>
&gt; easier to deal with than a<br/>
&gt; 60 lb. backpack.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Early platemail was<br/>
&gt; &gt;so damned thick and heavy, if a knight were to be knocked from his<br/>
&gt; warhorse<br/>
&gt; &gt;(horses bred specifically to be able to carry a knight) it meant likely<br/>
&gt; &gt;death, the knight trapped like a turtle on its back in the hot sun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, these are myths based on literature and parody illustrations of the<br/>
&gt; day and a modern<br/>
&gt; misunderstanding of the differences between battle and jousting armour.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have seen a fully armoured person do summersaults and vault a 4 foot<br/>
&gt; pole, I have seen them lythly<br/>
&gt; hop up from a prone position on the ground. This was wearing armour of a<br/>
&gt; period thickness hammered<br/>
&gt; of regular steel, not stainless.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Armour designed specifically for the de-horsing period in jousting got<br/>
&gt; very VERY heavy and very<br/>
&gt; specialized but this stuff was never used on the battlefield. Battlefeild<br/>
&gt; armour remained a balance<br/>
&gt; between weight and flexibility.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The whole thing about a fallen knight being like a turtle is a myth, now,<br/>
&gt; that being said, a dozen<br/>
&gt; peasents with polearms pulling a knight off his horse and shoving a itty<br/>
&gt; bitty knife through his<br/>
&gt; visor is a GOOD idea *laughs* and certainly happened. The famous<br/>
&gt; illustration of putting a knight on<br/>
&gt; his horse with block and tackle was a *parody* illustration, not<br/>
&gt; historical documentation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No one<br/>
&gt; &gt;forged stainless steel in those days.  (Come to think of it, maybe the EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt;plate is made of stainless steel.)  Little of this early armor remains,<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt;those pieces from especially short individuals, which no one else could<br/>
&gt; fit<br/>
&gt; &gt;into, when said short individual died within it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Plenty of this armour remains in collections throughout the world. A whole<br/>
&gt; lot more is manufactured<br/>
&gt; by modern smiths using period techniques based on these existing pieces.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
