<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712075104">that is the best thing i have heard so far, i love it.  this idea was thrown<br/>
around a long time ago and i forgot it til now.  even adding 1 or 2 damage<br/>
to the weapon stats, or double the procing rate of a weapon, i would love to<br/>
be able to do that to a tank heavy group =)<br/>

&gt; swords are more<br/>
&gt; swordlike, armor...well, I&#39;m sure you get the drift. It could add an<br/>
&gt; additional 3 or 4 points to all item stats. A weapon goes <br/>
&gt; from damage 12 to<br/>
&gt; damage 15. A breastplate goes from 22 to 25.  It would make <br/>
&gt; items that proc<br/>
&gt; want to proc more often. </span></blockquote></div>
