<div id="ygrps-yiv-505779035">I completely agree Silly.  This is exactly how my normal hunt group<br/>
works.  One primary taunter gets the complete heals, and our cleric throws<br/>
&quot;lesser&quot; heals at all the rest.  <br/>

&gt; group.<br/>
&gt; It is the most mana efficient spell when used correctly.  But the whole<br/>
&gt; group has to cooperate in order for this method to work.  What we do is<br/>
&gt; designate a primary tank.  This is a plate class who can be buffed to the<br/>
&gt; highest hit points (if you dont have a lot of choices, this can be a bard<br/>
&gt; but usually you have others with higher hps.)  The designated tank needs<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; have the ability to taunt the mobs onto him.  The idea is that you heal<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; when he runs low - usually when he drops below 2 bubs - if the rate of<br/>
&gt; damage is &#39;normal&#39; (certain mobs - especially bosses and epics have faster<br/>
&gt; than normal rates of damage and cheal alone is too slow.)  So, your tank<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; buffed to ~3k hps and your cheal - in one cast, heals him 2200 hps for 400<br/>
&gt; mana.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All that is well and good when the tank is taking the vast majority of the<br/>
&gt; damage.  If you have 2 &quot;tanks&quot; and they get into taunting wars or try to<br/>
&gt; outdamage the other, you have a real problem.  When you have 2 people<br/>
&gt; needing cheals, the 10 second cast time puts one in jeapordy - not to<br/>
&gt; mention the rest of the party if you get tied up for 20 seconds healing.<br/>
&gt; Good clerics keep remedy or sup heal memmed to keep the enchanters and<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; alive.  When I see an ench or bard-ench dropping down a bub, I am casting<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; heal their way (yes, I play a cleric too.)  If I get 2 &quot;tanks&quot; who try to<br/>
&gt; play like this, I remind them  that the designated tank is gonna get<br/>
&gt; (c)healed and mention that I hope the other guy has a lot of bandaids<br/>
&gt; along.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The cleric can heal - but he cant keep the whole group healed unless they<br/>
&gt; cooperate and help manage who gets the damage.  I will ask bards and<br/>
&gt; ragners<br/>
&gt; and any others to not melee, or to back out of the melee, or switch<br/>
&gt; weapons<br/>
&gt; if they are getting too much of the damage (and not the designated tanks.)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The best clerics I group with understand that cheal is only mana-efficient<br/>
&gt; above a certain hit point<br/>
&gt; range, which Bards rarely reach.  They&#39;re also aware of the fact that we<br/>
&gt; have maybe 55% the hit points of<br/>
&gt; a major tank.  The bad ones don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t like playing with the bad<br/>
&gt; ones.<br/>
&gt; I always end up hearing &quot;wow,<br/>
&gt; you died fast&quot;.  No kidding.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It&#39;s pretty clear that the clerics who think that Complete Heal is their<br/>
&gt; &gt; bread-and-butter spell don&#39;t know what they are doing.  I feel a lot<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; comfortable now when I see a cleric with a Remedy hotkey set up as soon<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; he joins the group...<br/>
