I think I can pretty much confirm that Mystic Clouding used to make us <br/>
invisible to undead as well as the living, (AND our fellow group members) <br/>
but in the last 2 days the undead have seen me consistently while singing <br/>
it.  If anyone else want to test this out or has similar experience with <br/>
this, let us know.<br/>
     <br/>
It was a typical strategy for me when visiting unrest to go invis right <br/>
outside the zone, zone in, restart the song, and start shouting for a group <br/>
and wandering around the courtyard and walls.  This way I would be left <br/>
alone from suprise attacks.  Then when a group might answer me with <br/>
something like &quot;meet us in the barkeep room&quot; I would just run in and join <br/>
them, then stop the song.  Many many times I strolled right past trains from <br/>
the basement and stood next to hags, etc, without being noticed.  Not <br/>
anymore :-(  Looks like this Bard needs to learn to be a bit more careful <br/>
from now on.<br/>
