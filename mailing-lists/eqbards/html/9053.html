the giants.  The lizards and basilisks supposedly do too,<br/>
though I&#39;m not too sure about that.  If you kill these guys,<br/>
you make more giants spawn.  The lizards and basilisks are<br/>
major green to me and run away, and the pathing bugs make them<br/>
impossible to chase.  So I&#39;d just charm a gaint and tow it<br/>
around, ordering it to kill these guys.<br/>

Oh yeah, one more thing.  Because of the pathing bugs and slow<br/>
updates (mobs blink in and out even with 0% PL), it&#39;s very<br/>
easy to accidently attack something someone else has already<br/>
attacked.  So try to be understanding when it happens.<br/>
