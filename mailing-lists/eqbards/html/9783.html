<div id="ygrps-yiv-398288504"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You&#39;d be bitter playing just about any class then.  Almost every class is<br/>
&gt;&quot;unfinished&quot;.  There are many spells and skills that were never implemented<br/>
&gt;or useless.  For example many classes have the Sense Magic spell, which has<br/>
&gt;no use at all.  And what about the poor Rogues?  They are much worse off<br/>
&gt;than Bards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Missing 3-4 spells out of 200 is hardly equivalent to missing 3-4 out of 50.<br/>
Also pure casters have nearly every advantage as it is in this game.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Haha.  Kitasi, I thought you said the ability to bind was one of the most<br/>
&gt;important abilities in the game.  How could giving Bind to Bards not be<br/>
&gt;unbalancing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bind is the most important ability in the game to HAVING FUN, not to beating<br/>
MOB&#39;s.  Since Making the game more fun is in no way unbalancing and bind<br/>
won&#39;t increase a bard&#39;s ability to beat anything, especially at a high<br/>
level, it isn&#39;t even remotely unbalancing.<br/>
<br/>
I may be somewhat bitter that bards are treated as an afterthought in many<br/>
ways by Verant, but at least I&#39;m not bitter towards anyone personally.<br/>
