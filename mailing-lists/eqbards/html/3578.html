<div id="ygrps-yiv-855254199">There was a guy like this on Veeshan last night in crush - folks like that<br/>
are gonna give barding a bad name.<br/>
<br/>
Not only had he a full set of bronze/steel, and a claw - we was CONSTANTLY<br/>
auctioning for a blackened iron crown, mistmoore drum, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He was set (of course) to anon.<br/>
<br/>
I challenged him about it and his response was &quot;I gave up my ranger dude -<br/>
want me to just dump his stuff?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not only was he powerleveling - he hadn&#39;t the slightest idea HOW to be a<br/>
bard. He told me that &quot;I screwed up&quot; by not dumping all xtra points into<br/>
str - when I asked him if that bronze wasn&#39;t a bit heavy for a bard.<br/>
<br/>
I informed him that no, str wasn&#39;t gonna be our primary stat - he was still<br/>
clueless. I&#39;m sure he thinks he can solo tank - also sure he&#39;ll say<br/>
&#39;barding sucks&#39; in just a few more levels.<br/>
<br/>
Watched him run around most of the night, not sure what level he was - but<br/>
he was still runnin from cents.<br/>
<br/>
I guess his idea of a bard is a tank that can sing *sigh*.<br/>
<br/>
The other day - this lvl 1 runs up to me, basically DEMANDS I find her<br/>
corpse (it was in the newbie zone, nearly in plain sight) - I almost choked<br/>
when I saw her putting on a complete set of steel.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I have a vicious streak - but it does my heart good to see both their<br/>
bodies on the ground (something that happens with a LOT more regularity<br/>
than I would have suspected).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to see anon not be available to anyone under lvl 10 or so - would<br/>
show these guys up for what they really are.  *MY* idea of helping out a<br/>
new character is patchwork, or *gasp* leather, hahaha - silly me.<br/>

&gt;it to him, nice gift.      No sooner had his new character spawned at the<br/>
&gt;Freeport  gates than some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked<br/>
&gt;if he wanted a  2H instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could<br/>
&gt;tell him how to say  thank you.     I  guess I&#39;m just bent because my bank<br/>
