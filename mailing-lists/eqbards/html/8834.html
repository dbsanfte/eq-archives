&gt; Well, I don&#39;t know in what way you mean that it is broken,<br/>
&gt; but I used it EXTENSIVELY since the patch to interrupt<br/>
&gt; spellcasters in Solusek A, and it worked perfectly.  I was<br/>
&gt; not using it to mezmerize something for a long period of<br/>
&gt; time, its common other usage, so it may in fact be broken<br/>
&gt; in that way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The knockback is not broken, and so you can still use the song<br/>
to interrupt casters (provided they fail their channeling<br/>
check).  The mesmerize/stun effect is what is broken.  Also,<br/>
the frequency at which the mesmerize/stun doesn&#39;t work seems<br/>
to depend on level.  It works almost all the time against<br/>
greens and low blues, but against high blues or higher, it is<br/>
pretty much useless - charm works better, which is why I&#39;ve<br/>
been using Siren&#39;s recently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The stun and knockback both interrupt casters.  We&#39;re mostly<br/>
missing the stun component right now, so the song is less<br/>
effective at interrupting than before.<br/>
