<div id="ygrps-yiv-629445317">Assist works great for my party.  The only thing that might be called a bug about<br/>
it, is if you are already fighting the same monster and you hit your assist hotkey<br/>
again, you may end up targetting the player you meant to assist, but then, that<br/>
would really be an operator error anyway (since you would be assisting the mob that<br/>
is fighting the player in your party, assist is actually working as it should).  I<br/>
don&#39;t think Assist is buggy.  Probably people are using it wrong.  If you have a<br/>
main tank that is usually in your party, you can make a hotkey just for that<br/>
character (/assist tank).  That saves time targeting them and reduces the liklihood<br/>
of errors.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The people in my party use /assist all the time, and we&#39;ve found it to be very<br/>
&gt; very buggy.  For some reason, /assist will often have them or their pets attack<br/>
&gt; completely different mobs, and we don&#39;t know why.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone else had similar experiences?<br/>
