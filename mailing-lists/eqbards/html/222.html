<div id="ygrps-yiv-697165506">Selling your drum and going with the lute depends on how you&#39;d lke to<br/>
play. If you plan on staying right around Freeport for a while and do not<br/>
plan on travelling then you could probably do without the drum. If you want<br/>
to travel far distances then the drum is very nice to cut the time down (not<br/>
to mention a greater ability to outrun darn near anything). For now the lute<br/>
will only boost your heal by 2 hps a pulse and increase the damage (and<br/>
range?) of Chords.<br/>

    Subject: [eqbards] Hello and Question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Hello all - I just discovered this board!  I am a half-elf Bard on<br/>
Xegony.  I have been operating in the Freeport areas mostly - and hope to<br/>
start some travelling in the near future...<br/>
<br/>
        I JUST made level 8 and have a few questions.  Since I just made 8<br/>
and can develop String Instruments - should I sell my drum after getting the<br/>
lute?  Is there any need for both?  (Obviously a concern is carrying slots).<br/>
Is there a difference between the lute and the mandolin?<br/>
<br/>
        Lastly - I am always short of money.  Most of my money goes to<br/>
songs - my armor is pretty thin.  Any suggestions for making money.<br/>
<br/>
        I apologize if these questions have been answered many times<br/>
before - as I am new to the list.  If there is a searchable archive<br/>
somewhere - please point me there!<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks<br/>
<br/>
