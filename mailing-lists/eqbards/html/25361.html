<div id="ygrps-yiv-103962645">I don&#39;t know what level it procs, But I can narrow it down slightly. A lvl 37 Bard friend of mine was<br/>
unable to use it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well, you guys asked me to let you know what I got for the Horn in the<br/>
&gt; end.  To bring you up to date, I lucked into a Horn of Hsagra, doing a<br/>
&gt; low-level quest in Ak&#39;Anon (probably due to a loot-table mixup).  I offered<br/>
&gt; it to a friend of mine who is in a guild, and he said to write my own<br/>
&gt; ticket.  So I did.  I requested the Lute of the Howler, and some coins for<br/>
&gt; the Nostrolo Tambourine quest.  I didn&#39;t expect to get all of that, but I<br/>
&gt; was hopeful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Today I got a call, requesting my presence in West Commons.  There, I was<br/>
&gt; presented, in trade for the Horn, a bag containing one Lute of the Howler,<br/>
&gt; 6 Ancient Coins, and 18 peridots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d say I did well.<br/>

&gt; P.S. What level can I use the Lute&#39;s illusion?<br/>
