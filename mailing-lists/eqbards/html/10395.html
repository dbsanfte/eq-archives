&gt; I agree with you Jay. It is ridiculous that our main skills have a cap on<br/>
&gt; it. why dont they just cap off our singing at 200 like the other<br/>
&gt; instruments. Are not our voices a form of an instrument. If someone finds a<br/>
&gt; petition on this to change let me know. I will definatly sign up and i have<br/>
&gt; alot of friends that will sign :) Bards of the World Unite :)<br/>

after L39. <br/>
