 </span></blockquote>What you&#39;re failing to see is that a MMORPG is *more* than a<br/>
pencil & paper RPG.  A P&P RPG was limited to just a few<br/>
people in a universe where everyone but them was an NPC.  A<br/>
MMORPG is a virtual universe, and for the first time the<br/>
possibility exists where the entire world *could* be run<br/>
without any NPCs at all.  If killing monsters with friends is<br/>
all you want, then you don&#39;t need something as extensive as UO<br/>
or EQ, a non-persistent world like Diablo is sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the first MMORPG are going to emulate P&P RPGs, because<br/>
that&#39;s where all the previous experience with this type of<br/>
thing has been.  But as players and developers start to get a<br/>
better handle on just what is/isn&#39;t possible, we&#39;re going to<br/>
start getting closer and closer to the virtual realities that<br/>
keep getting hyped in the media.<br/>
<br/>
I was just talking with some UO friends about the new UO<br/>
server that&#39;s going up and the de-emphasized role of NPC<br/>
merchants there.  One of them said the same thing you did - he<br/>
works enough in real life, he doesn&#39;t want to spend his<br/>
game-playing time &quot;working&quot; in a &quot;game&quot; to help someone<br/>
maintain an online merchant store.  Then it hit us - someone<br/>
who is sufficiently wealthy in real life could *pay* someone<br/>
real-life money to employ someone to *work* in a merchant<br/>
store in a &quot;game.&quot;  That is the paradigm shift most people<br/>
don&#39;t yet realize - we are moving from &quot;online game&quot; to<br/>
&quot;virtual world,&quot; and the line between virtual and real is<br/>
beginning to blur.  We&#39;re already seeing it with people paying<br/>
real-life money for virtual items.<br/>
