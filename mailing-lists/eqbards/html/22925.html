&gt;the game), and could run faster then others...that got me to start playing <br/>
&gt;the Bard, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard <br/>

&gt;So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I started a Bard because I was a Bard in DragonRealms, and a Bard in <br/>
Amtgard, and a Bard in real life.  So, no reason, really ;)<br/>
