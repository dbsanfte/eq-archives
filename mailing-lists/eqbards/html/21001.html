Spent most of the day regressing fixed bugs.<br/>
Tomorrow (unless something big comes up) will be devoted to Bards. I <br/>
have a time set up with GZ to talk about everything, so I promise <br/>
progress is being made!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I also promise to let you know what we find are bugs and what is <br/>
intentional when it comes to bards. Please just be a little more <br/>
paitent!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys<br/>
<br/>
