Grats Gael! We saw ya&#39;ll coming in to HS about the time we weremaking our<br/>
last round. Started going all the way through North then going through West<br/>
once we got the key and then back to North, etc. It was less boring than<br/>
sitting in either spot. We were on our last round when the ogre fell into<br/>
the hole that he&#39;d carefully avoided the last 2 cycles. I think it was a<br/>
plot against me as the Procurator was finally up and we had just enough time<br/>
to get to him, until the ogre forgot about the rug.<br/>
I had put my foot down about no raids all weekend so I could get to 56.<br/>
Logged on Friday and everyone is screaming for help to do Trak again so we<br/>
went along. Bard bp dropped and I won the lotto. After that we rounded up<br/>
some exp minded folks and entertained Darkfox in HS. Our wiz put succor in<br/>
his harvest spell spot and accidently ported us to zonein twice. (The third<br/>
succor was intentional.)<br/>
