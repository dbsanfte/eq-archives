<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535979770">I happened to run across the Wolves in Kithicor last night.  They viewed me <br/>
as Amiable, I am a follower of Tunare. And as a general rule I try to avoid <br/>
killing things that are amiable to me :)<br/>
<br/>
Also on the merchant pricing it seems merchants that get a lot of business <br/>
seem to pay less for items.<br/>

&gt; &gt; die kind of feeling, but more of a prickling along the back of your neck<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; get when your &#39;Wolf&#39; faction takes a hit.  Next thing I know it did just<br/>
&gt; &gt; that!  Since when is there a faction of Wolves?  Unnerved I walked <br/>
&gt;around<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think ever since they fixed it so wolves and bears no longer<br/>
&gt; &gt;attack druids and rangers on sight.  I would dearly love to<br/>
&gt; &gt;know how to raise my faction with wolf as I&#39;ve always liked<br/>
&gt; &gt;wolves.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmmm, doubt that.  I kill wolves all of the time, and I do mean all of the<br/>
&gt;time, trying to find those quality pelts you understand so I can clothe<br/>
&gt;myself in studded and some day reinforced armor.  I even died yesterday <br/>
&gt;when<br/>
&gt;4 silvermist wolves decided I was being mean to their fellow in N Karana <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;joined in.  I have never seen a hit to &#39;Wolf&#39; faction before and they all<br/>
&gt;still glare threateningly at me like they did the day I was born.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kitasi the wolf-hated?<br/>
