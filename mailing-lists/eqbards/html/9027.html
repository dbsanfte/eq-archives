<div id="ygrps-yiv-234794696">Well, it actually has to hit YOU for you to get that message.  Hitting other party members<br/>
doesn&#39;t give the message.  It is there.  I assure you.<br/>

&gt; The only damage message I have ever gotten when I sing Psalm of Warmth is<br/>
&gt; &quot;Mob was burned&quot;. I have never gotten a text message in white saying the mob<br/>
&gt; took 5 pts of non-melee damage.  I get the white colored message when I have<br/>
&gt; the thorn shield up.  In the fight with two bards where I was singing Warmth<br/>
&gt; and the other was singing Cooling, I got the &quot;Mob was burned message&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t remember seeing the damage message for the Cooling song.  I would<br/>
&gt; guess it would say something like &quot;mob was frozen&quot;.  As a result, can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; confirm if the two songs cancelled out.  It would make sense that they did.<br/>
&gt; Guess I need to start using the log parser.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Sure wish we got the white text message for our damage shields similar to<br/>
&gt; &gt; what you get when you have the druid thorn buff (not certain of exact<br/>
&gt; &gt; name).  With the thorn buff, it tells you how much non-melee damage the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mob took when they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hit you.  Anyone have an idea why we don&#39;t get a similar message?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You *do* get the same message.  If you weren&#39;t, I&#39;d take that<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a sign that they were canceling eaching other.<br/>
