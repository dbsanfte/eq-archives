effectiveness against any monster, vs. cleric effectiveness<br/>
against any monster.  Somehow we lost the &quot;effectiveness<br/>
against any monster&quot; part and it became bard vs. cleric.  I<br/>
dunno how it became a melee-only contest too, maybe because I<br/>
was comparing defensive melee skills and someone dropped the<br/>
&quot;defensive&quot; part.<br/>
<br/>
Since our offensive capability is melee-based whereas a<br/>
clerics is a magic/melee mix, I felt (and still feel) our<br/>
defensive melee capability needs to be better than theirs by<br/>
more than 45 dodge points.<br/>
