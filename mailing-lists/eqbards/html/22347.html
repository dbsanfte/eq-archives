<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598888054">Thanks Olgwinn :), I suspected timing was the issue.<br/>
<br/>
My question then is, if so much pause needs to be added to the macros to make them work, is it actualy faster to use the separate commands?<br/>
<br/>
When I thought of adding pauses into my attack macro, I thought well, it seems faster to have the separate attack key.<br/>
<br/>
I know there is the advantage of fewer keys to mash, but in a situation where a mob is beating on you or your party member, speed is of the essence.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; What I&#39;ve found in these hotkey macro things, is that ANY time you have <br/>
&gt; multiple commands going off, you need to insert a pause before EACH line in <br/>
&gt; the macro.  I guess the EQ engine just can&#39;t handle too many commands going <br/>
&gt; off at once.<br/>
