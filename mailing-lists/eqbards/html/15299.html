<div id="ygrps-yiv-447767789">Remember it takes 2-4 times the exp in the hell level.  You are losing the<br/>
same amount of exp, just looks like less because of the amount it takes to<br/>
gain a level.<br/>

It happened again, but slightly differently this time.<br/>
<br/>
When I was level 30, I lost about a quarter bubble per death.<br/>
I reached 31, then died without having gained any experience.<br/>
I lost a bit more than a half bubble into 30.<br/>
<br/>
I hit 47 last night, then died without having gained any<br/>
experience in it.  I lost &quot;only&quot; a bit more than a half bubble<br/>
into 46.  My friends who&#39;ve died at 46 all said they lost<br/>
about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 bubble per death in it.<br/>
<br/>
So it really looks like you lose a lot more experience in the<br/>
levels after hell levels.  I&#39;d love to flame the genius at<br/>
Verant who thought that one up.<br/>
