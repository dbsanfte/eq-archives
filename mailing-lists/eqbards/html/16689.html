If you think of your direction as a compass degrees, if your<br/>
friend is at 159 and you are facing 120, the obvious way to<br/>
get you to follow your friend is to gradually increase your<br/>
heading - 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 159.  Likewise,<br/>
if your friend was at 94, you&#39;d decrease your heading - 115,<br/>
110, 105, 100, 95, 94.  The problem with coding it like that<br/>
is if your friend is at 359 and you&#39;re facing 5.  The logic<br/>
says since 5 is less than 359, to increase the 5 until you hit<br/>
359.  That makes you loop around to the right.<br/>
