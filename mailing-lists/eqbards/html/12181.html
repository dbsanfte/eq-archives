<div id="ygrps-yiv-388287507">Over the holidays I went to Mistmoore to try and get a gypsy lute.  When I<br/>
got there, a 50th level wizard was in the castle camping the gypsies so he<br/>
could farm battle drums for his friends.  I asked him if I could purchase a<br/>
gypsy lute from him if one got dropped.  He said I could have it for free<br/>
assuming I got there before it decayed.  I started up the invis song and<br/>
made my way to the piano room.  I would have to say that was the most scared<br/>
I have ever been in my whole EQ life.  No one was camping the courtyard so<br/>
as I made my way to the castle I walked past numerous ancilles, deathly<br/>
ushers, gargoyles etc.  There must have been at least 20 mobs from the<br/>
graveyard gate and castle gate.  Fortunately, my invis song stayed up the<br/>
entire time.  Made my way where the wizard was sitting and started waiting.<br/>
I ended up sitting there for over an hour watching the wizard take out<br/>
numerous gypsies and other mobs.  To my misfortune, not once did a gypsy<br/>
drop a lute.  While fighting a werewolf, a wandering mob joined in and the<br/>
wiz had to gate out.  He then decided to go somewhere else.  I made my way<br/>
back down to safety.  I wasted an hour I could have been doing something<br/>
else but it was still fun due to the risk involved.  <br/>
