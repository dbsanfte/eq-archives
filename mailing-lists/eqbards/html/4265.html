<div id="ygrps-yiv-985867570">Well, it has finally happened.  What started out as a great resource<br/>
for bards has finally degenerated into flames and topics far removed<br/>
from bards, and even from EQ.  There are a LOT of dead horses being beat<br/>
around here.<br/>
<br/>
    I recieve the digest form of this list.  Out of 25 messages in the<br/>
most recent digest, only 6 of them were specifically bard related.  6.<br/>
That is all.  I am trying to remember the last thread that vaguely<br/>
interested me and frankly I cannot.  Most posts are either about<br/>
twinking, acronyms, or posts complaining about the threads, while at the<br/>
same time quoting about 100+ lines of text.  Hardly what I would deem<br/>
worth my time to scroll through.<br/>
<br/>
    I will be unsubscribing from this list soon if this keeps up.<br/>
Please remember the rules of etiquette on this mailing list.  Here are a<br/>
few:<br/>
<br/>
1.  No messages that say &quot;Me too&quot; and then quote several pages of<br/>
earlier posts.  Please either keep this to yourself or e-mail the author<br/>
directly, as this is not the place for such.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Any threads that are not related to EQ, and bards specifically.  I<br/>
could care less about lottery winners&#39; lifestyles, opinions on twinking,<br/>
or witty and pointless explanations of what RTS means.  There are forums<br/>
for this sort of thing, try eq.stratics.com or www.eqvault.com.  Stick<br/>
to bard stuff here please.<br/>
<br/>
3.  EXCESSIVE quoting of other messages.  Please snip if you feel you<br/>
have to quote.  And for those who recieve each e-mail from the list,<br/>
please change the subject if the subject has changed, like so:<br/>
<br/>
Re: How Jackpot Winners Live, was Re: Twinking<br/>
<br/>
4.  Personal discussions and flames should be via e-mail if at all.  If<br/>
I wanted petty squabbling I would go back to reading newsgroups.<br/>
<br/>
    Now, please, people, we have a good resource here and I suggest that<br/>
we use it.  No one person can know all there is to know in the game, and<br/>
so this list was created.  Let&#39;s get back to bards here.<br/>
<br/>
    New thread topic, just so this post has worth.  Definitely bard<br/>
related, as it deals with equipment that all bards will eventually need.<br/>
<br/>
    Recently, the spawn on rubicite armor has been messed up.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t drop any more, apparently.  In Cazic-Thule, where ruby normally<br/>
drops, at a peak time, there were only 6 people.  This got me to<br/>
thinking.  After some thought I have come to a conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Rubicite armor is too good to be in EverQuest.<br/>
<br/>
    Let me back this up.  8 out of the 14 classes can wear ruby.  That<br/>
is more than half.  Of these 8, 3 of those classes (rogue, ranger,<br/>
shaman) CANNOT wear regular plate, and so it is obviously HIGHLY<br/>
desirable for them.  However, ruby is also BETTER than the Steel Plate<br/>
that can be bought by the other 5 classes, so they want it too.  In<br/>
addition, Steel Plate is so expensive that many players will just camp<br/>
for ruby instead of buying steel..<br/>
<br/>
    So, we have an armor that is arguably the best magical armor that<br/>
can be had, for more than half of the players in EQ.  (Yes, Mithril and<br/>
a few other pieces are better but are only wearable by a few, for<br/>
example we bards cannot wear Mithril).  And, it is only found in one<br/>
place.  And, it is a rare drop.  What this means is that there will<br/>
NEVER be enough ruby to go around.<br/>
<br/>
    This throws everything out of whack.  Camping is SUCH an issue with<br/>
ruby that apparently Verant decided to take it out of the game, at least<br/>
for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
    SO what can be done to solve this problem?  Here are a few<br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Make Steel Plate cheaper.  If a 40th level bard can go and spend a<br/>
reasonable amount of plat on Steel from an NPC, why camp for ruby?  A<br/>
full set of Steel Plate, just the visible pieces, mind you, costs over<br/>
3000 plat.  A good hunk of change, even at those levels.  Probably<br/>
easier to just get in a group camping ruby and just wait.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Make ruby the same AC as Steel.  That way, classes who can normally<br/>
wear plate will have no real reason to camp for it.  It would be easier<br/>
and less boring to just save up and buy Steel.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Make other, better magical armors for the plate wearing classes.  If<br/>
there was Sapphirite Armor, 1 AC better than Rubicite, usable only by<br/>
classes who can wear plate, that dropped off of say unique minotaurs in<br/>
Beholder, then that would cut down on the demand for ruby and thus the<br/>
camping for it. [ Note: if Green Splinted Platemail (like Aradune wears)<br/>
makes it into the game, and is wearable by those who can wear ruby and<br/>
by monks also (like it is rumored to), then green will replace ruby as<br/>
the best armor in the game, and will be camped like hell, not solving<br/>
the problem at all.]<br/>
<br/>
4.  Make ruby only usable by Shamans, Rogues, and Rangers.  This, again,<br/>
would cut down on demand and thus on the camping as well.<br/>
<br/>
    Basically, these ideas popped into my head when I was in Solusek B,<br/>
hunting fire giants in a big guild meeting.  About 20 people above 40th<br/>
were there, and ALL of them that could wear it had some rubicite on.<br/>
All.  I think this is a bad thing, that there should be more variety of<br/>
equipment among players who can roam Norrath without fear (much).<br/>
Hopefully, Verant has seen this problem and is taking steps to correct<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
    So what do you all think?  When you get to that level, will you<br/>
settle for steel?  Or will you join the droves that want rubicite<br/>
instead?  Can we think of other ways to solve the problem?  IS this a<br/>
problem?<br/>
<br/>
On topic discussion is appreciated.  And please, keep it about bards.<br/>
