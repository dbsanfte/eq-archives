<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509114751">I have to agree to both sides of this issue.  Outright begging... through<br/>
shouts or OOC... or gods help me walking up to me and saying &quot;Can you give<br/>
me some money/this item/whatever&quot; I find annoying in the extreme...<br/>
<br/>
But the sort of IC actions described below here... that&#39;s a horse of a<br/>
different color... in fact, done ICly, and with a little style... even<br/>
walking up to me and saying &quot;can you give me 5 gold&quot; will result in a yes.<br/>
Case in point... last night in blackburrow, when I was in a very bad mood<br/>
after being chastised for killing an elite gnoll guard that was standing<br/>
around picking it&#39;s ears while the party that ultimately chastised me beat<br/>
the snot out of a guardsman two rooms away, there was a barbarian standing<br/>
around up near the zone creatively using the crouch and sit commands to make<br/>
himself appear to be dancing... and yelling &quot;Dancing for money!&quot; and similar<br/>
such things.  It made me laugh, and my bard was suitably amused to give him<br/>
5 gold on the spot along with a few words of encouragement to continue<br/>
practicing as he might one day have a career in dance.<br/>
<br/>
SO Yes, I&#39;d say that done ICly it&#39;s acceptable... at least to me... provided<br/>
it isnt a constant thing.<br/>
