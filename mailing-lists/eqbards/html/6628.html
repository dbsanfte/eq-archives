<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986641082">i agree with everything you say.  the only problem is that EVERY person who<br/>
had russet from PoF knew damn well it was going to be warrior only in a<br/>
future patch.  so they can take their whining and tell someone who cares<br/>
(unfortunately verant did care bleh).  when we were in Fear, every piece of<br/>
russett after maybe the first day was allowed to be looted ONLY by warriors.<br/>
the only instance i saw was one bard with a breastplate and a different bard<br/>
with arms.  and both of them knew full well they&#39;d lose it.  oh well, guess<br/>
i will feedback it hehe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Russet Armor: Same scenario as the Ranger who could not <br/>
&gt; re-equip his Hero<br/>
&gt; Bracer, but in this case, you remove your armor and now you <br/>
&gt; have no armor,<br/>
&gt; and you can&#39;t sell or trade it because it is NO TRADE NO <br/>
&gt; DROP.  I do think,<br/>
&gt; however, that if you are high enough level to have that kind <br/>
&gt; of item, you<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t have all that much trouble replacing it with <br/>
&gt; something decent,<br/>
&gt; (not from fear plane of course ;-) again (as in the box) fair <br/>
&gt; warning would<br/>
&gt; have resolved this.<br/>

&gt; &gt; absolutely.  i don&#39;t understand the reversal of lustrous <br/>
&gt; russett from<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior only to all plate wearers.  it is obviously intended <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be warrior<br/>
&gt; &gt; only and i hope they change it back.  every armor from PoF is <br/>
&gt; &gt; class specific<br/>
&gt; &gt; to one class.  lustrous russett should be no different.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; What does everyone think about all the changes from monday&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; patch that were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reversed yesterday? (Box of abu ja&#39;far [sorry, cannot resist <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; : )], Hero Bracer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.)  Personally, i think the Lustrous Russet armor SHOULD <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; BE warrior only,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but they should have made it so instantly when they <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; discovered the error.<br/>
