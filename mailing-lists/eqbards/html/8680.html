<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-348365926">i tried fufil&#39;s also (did not try either tuyen&#39;s song) and all i got was 3<br/>
ticks of 10dmg and -14 magic resistance.  no change with mistmoore battle<br/>
drum.  from what i remember this is exactly what it was pre-patch.  oh well.<br/>
along with that and no breastplate a pretty disappointing day.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I almost forgot too... anyone notice less missed notes?  i started,<br/>
stopped, and restarted the level 50 song 10 times with no missed notes.  i<br/>
was only confirming what another 50 bard noticed.  that would be impossible<br/>
pre-patch, that song missed notes more than not.  so one good thing at least<br/>

&gt; Oh, I almost forgot, I tested fufil&#39;s curtailing chant last <br/>
&gt; night to see how<br/>
&gt; good the improvements were on it and the dang thing was still <br/>
&gt; resisted 60%<br/>
&gt; of the time when used against blue MOBs so apparently the <br/>
&gt; resists were not<br/>
&gt; changed on this song.  Bummer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t do any hard number crunching test with it, but it <br/>
&gt; did not appear to<br/>
&gt; be significantly improved as far as damage goes when sung so <br/>
&gt; I switched to<br/>
&gt; the drum (normal hand drum, I am not yet among the lucky <br/>
&gt; battle bangers) and<br/>
&gt; tried it and the damage seemed significant, appeared to do <br/>
&gt; around 50 damage<br/>
&gt; total over the duration of the DoT (I targeted myself and was <br/>
&gt; having much<br/>
&gt; lag and PL last night so the results cant be considered very <br/>
&gt; accurate but<br/>
&gt; only approximate).  I&#39;m guessing this is similar to the <br/>
&gt; difference between<br/>
&gt; singing DD and playing it with a brass horn, night and day as someone<br/>
&gt; recently noted.  <br/>
