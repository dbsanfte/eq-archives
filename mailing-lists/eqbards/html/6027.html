<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125537472">LOL, actually no :)  I usually buy my songs 4 to 5 levels ahead of time.  I <br/>
currently have all my songs through 40 in the bank.  Hmmm come to think of <br/>
maybe that us why I have been stuck at 30 for the last week.....<br/>

&gt;Ok, I have been &quot;stuck&quot; in level 22 for a good long week now.  I think I<br/>
&gt;have found the cause.  Last time I was at the library in HighKeep, I bought<br/>
&gt;my 23rd level song.  Does anyone else thing buying songs ahead of time is<br/>
&gt;bad luck???<br/>
