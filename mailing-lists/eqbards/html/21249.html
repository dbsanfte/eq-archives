 </span></blockquote>Wasn&#39;t there a quote from Abashi recently about the quests for the<br/>
other classes equivelant to the Fiery Avenger being almost completed?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could that be what the &#39;new content&#39; is in Ester&#39;s latest post?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I spent 90% of my day going over some new content so it goes in correctly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is the project we have been working on for almost two<br/>
weeks now and there is an end in sight. Next are Bards (not just lulaby) and<br/>

<br/>
Something to keep our fingers crossed for... you know, when we&#39;re not<br/>
