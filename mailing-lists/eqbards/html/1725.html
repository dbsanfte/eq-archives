<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574244070">I like the idea of an AC bonus due to Bards carrying less relative weight. <br/>
I tend to keep mine very low, even trading heavy but effective pieces of <br/>
armor for lighter and crappier ac-giving pieces that offer other benefits <br/>
to stats.<br/>
However, once I can afford plate I reckon I&#39;ll wear it, in fact... I really <br/>
much doubt I won&#39;t.<br/>
You see, my image of Bards is more along the lines of a berzerking maniac <br/>
singing in battle as he or she hacks their way through a group of enemies, <br/>
a crazed grin on their faces as they chant out wild, skin-crawling songs <br/>
laced with arcane and guttural sounds that none else could hope to imitate. <br/>
The blood may splatter them, but they don&#39;t care. They&#39;ll laugh afterwards <br/>
as they leap into a freezing stream (and drown like fools if they&#39;re <br/>
wearing plate) to wash it all off. Then they&#39;ll sit down and eat, drink, <br/>
rest and sing their warm, soothing melodies that somehow still maintain an <br/>
edge to them, the very words the Bard pronounces throb with a very obvious <br/>
power.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t quite fit Verant&#39;s image, but it&#39;s arguably close enough to not <br/>
make me a real-life plate-wearing fool. ;)<br/>

Well, this debate has certainly heated things up.  Its clear there is an<br/>
easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>
image of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>
while sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have <br/>
a<br/>
bazooka too.  Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>
is moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard.  to me <br/>
that<br/>
image is more important than being as effective as possible.  I kinda wish<br/>
they&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>
light armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>
even equal, just better than nothing.  If not, oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of having some bard specific items.  Singing swords, <br/>
magical<br/>
instruments, any of these would be great!  Most of the other classes seem <br/>
to<br/>
have items tailored towards them with the exception of bards.  Oh yeah sure<br/>
we can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>
like a monk, why would we?  It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>
could make better use of than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
On most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>
The way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>
they should travel more than any other character.  To have to do this<br/>
without being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>
minstrel could bind himself anywhere.<br/>

      &quot;and no one shall work for money,<br/>
       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>
     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,<br/>
        and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>
