<br/>
We also took down CT this weekend on E&#39;ci, first time Fear had successfully<br/>
been broken since it was &quot;enhanced&quot;.  I unfortunately passed out shortly<br/>
after the Dracoliche fight around 4am Sunday morning, and CT fell a few<br/>
hours later.  In all, we broke in around 9pm Saturday night and held<br/>
it until late Monday Night (when the servers went down). <br/>
<br/>
So about 50 hours of fear-fighting for 1 friggin piece of carmine armor,<br/>
and I didn&#39;t even get it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   In a long, tedious 2 day struggle inside the PoF, CT was finally<br/>
&gt;   dropped on Innoruuk.  Had to ignore my girlfriend for hours on<br/>
&gt;   end, so now I owe her big time. ;)  CT would have dropped sooner,<br/>
&gt;   but we tried all this during times where most people had to sleep<br/>
&gt;   or go to work the next day.  Thus, during the nighttime a small<br/>
&gt;   group of people held the plane clear until others would arrive<br/>
&gt;   after naps/work.  The combined efforts of 5 or 6 guilds paid off<br/>
&gt;   around 10:00pm ET yesterday when the plane was finally cleared.<br/>
&gt;   At 10:30pm ET Cazic Thule was dead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Two days in the PoF teaches you a whole lot.  More than one short<br/>
&gt;   12 hour burst, imo.  I logged 32 hours of the 48 it was held.  I<br/>
&gt;   know the zone like the back of my hand now, thanks to Solidarity<br/>
&gt;   of Vision and exploration.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   24 people in the Cazic wave dropped him in less than 2 mins.<br/>
&gt;   While we were buffing up, 4 mobs spawned in the zone, and thus<br/>
&gt;   wave2 with 24 more people came to aid with the extras after the <br/>
&gt;   God fell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   GMs were present during the slaying.  First ever on Innoruuk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I got the privledge of being in CT GR1, the primary and initial<br/>
&gt;   group which charged Cazic.  Only one member of my group perished,<br/>
&gt;   100% resisted Panic.  Verses of Victory and Mystical Shielding<br/>
&gt;   were played in battle.  Cazic Thule hit me once for 40 dmg and<br/>
&gt;   once for 171 dmg.  He never touched me again, although I was<br/>
&gt;   Gravity Fluxed about 3 times during the battle.  I did over 500<br/>
&gt;   combined dmg, including 2 yk procs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I think I died about 6 times on the whole trip.  Two of those<br/>
&gt;   times, I really couldn&#39;t do anything to help it if you get my<br/>
&gt;   meaning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   To be honest, we bent him over hard.  He didnt stand a chance.<br/>
&gt;   Since I was the only bard there for 90% of the time, and since<br/>
&gt;   I did breakin, I am now carrying the Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccalo.<br/>
&gt;   Yeah it&#39;s useless, but it&#39;s God loot.  And the only one on this<br/>
&gt;   server too ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Since there was nothing else for a bard on the plane, a lot of<br/>
&gt;   people owe me hateplane trips now ;)  And I&#39;ve already gotten<br/>
&gt;   2 invites to go during the next week.  More imbrued here I come ;)<br/>
