<div id="ygrps-yiv-151430611">Hello all , <br/>
Well here&#39;s my general view on twinking as its&#39;s called. ( never knew it had <br/>
a name till a few days ago ) I plan to do it if i create another char , which <br/>
i know i will. but that being said , i won&#39;t give myself ruby at lvl 1 . I&#39;ll <br/>
do it at the level my new char could do it himself. See I hate hunting for <br/>
ruby now , and as far as i&#39;m concerned i never want to do it again. Even in <br/>
my next life.  Sitting in that throne room or wherever , not getting much <br/>
ruby . and all that bad stuff , i hate it.... but i want ruby so i endure . <br/>
But never again.  ( race war server excluded ) I personally see nothing wrong <br/>
with this , my char will get the ruby i have , only when he can get it <br/>
himself. I just would like to see people&#39;s views on this, but i really see <br/>
nothing wrong with it. <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah , and as a random mini-rant . I read an interview with brad where he <br/>
talks about his views on exploration and how it makes the game better. <br/>
getting away from crowded spots etc etc. My view is , how the heck do you <br/>
know where to go and what you can kill ? I go somewhere with a full group and <br/>
i see something that cons red to me , how do i know if its 2 -3 lvls above me <br/>
or 20 ? Some people might say attack it and find out , and if it goes bad <br/>
run. but as fun as looking at new places is and finding great huntings spots. <br/>
the risks of dying and losing a lot exp really stinks. And so maybe  as a  <br/>
bard i can get out with my life , chances are i will lose at least one party <br/>
member, well gee i don&#39;t like to do that to people. He talks about how much <br/>
he likes permafrost , well the guy helped make the game , of course he knows <br/>
where to go and what his group can take and what would destroy him. I don&#39;t , <br/>
i explore , but i very rarely hunt in unfamiliar very uncrowded places. ( <br/>
rathe mtns scare the crap out of me ) <br/>
<br/>
Ok thats that just wanted to say it<br/>
