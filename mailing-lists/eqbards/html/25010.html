<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Tallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not directly related <br/>
&gt;to barding.  Bards do provide a lot of input into what is seen in game <br/>
&gt;graphically, so this can be an important topic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 16 MB AGP <br/>
&gt;graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a better <br/>
&gt;graphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram - <br/>
&gt;done.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards <br/>
&gt;they use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything <br/>
&gt;else of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and <br/>
&gt;some places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;scrape me off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks again for all the help,<br/>

Do not trifle with Bards, for we are not subtle, and your name scans to <br/>
Greensleeves.<br/>
<br/>
Nice names on your part, though.  Dragonriders fan, I see.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - as to your request, I can&#39;t recommend something, but I can <br/>
recommend AGAINST anything by 3dfx.  Not only are they no more, but their <br/>
technology is receiving no more support (the end of opengl?)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also looking forward to some good suggestions - I want to upgrade, too ;)<br/>
