<div id="ygrps-yiv-891451628">We are usually the only people in the zone.  From previous experience, there<br/>
is never anyone in there.  I spent more than a month with a iksar camped in<br/>
the zone (to try to buy a ancient coin) and only saw a Japanese players (who<br/>
will never answer any tells, I assume they dont speak much English)</div>
