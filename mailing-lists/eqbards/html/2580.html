<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359270166"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;I haven&#39;t been able to come up with a word that means the same thing - I<br/>
&gt; &gt;mean, really<br/>
&gt; &gt;proc vs. &quot;magic weapon that casts a spell, too&quot; is a bit prohibitive....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now there&#39;s a challenge for the creative minds of the collected bards.<br/>
&gt; Find a term for this effect that&#39;s simple, elegant, poetic, accurate and<br/>
&gt; intuitive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To me using &quot;proc&quot; is similar to using &quot;snork&quot;.  Both are equally<br/>
&gt; meaningless to the uninitiated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, just so everyone knows: proc = procedure. In my opinion it sounds like<br/>
it&#39;s a term ripped straight from DIKU mud, but it can be considered a common<br/>
programming term. A procedure is merely a block of code.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you need a better term? You don&#39;t. Deal with it. A proc is a proc,<br/>
don&#39;t screw up the jargon.</div>
