<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346699948">My guess would be that the numbers for Enchanters, Wizards, Clerics, Druids<br/>
and Shamen are greatly under-reported because of their tendency to go anon<br/>
to avoid unwanted attention.<br/>
<br/>
Twinks are in the habit of going anon too, so you can expect the Bard number<br/>
to be a bit higher since we&#39;re the current &quot;vogue&quot;, twink-wise.<br/>
<br/>
Bertoxx Bards are enjoying a bit of a renaissance - I typically see 18 in<br/>
the 40-60 range and 30 or more from 1-39.<br/>

<br/>
Well due to the enormous problems on E&#39;ci getting numbers during peak time<br/>
has been difficult but here they are as it is.<br/>
<br/>
Bards 		31<br/>
Shadow Knights	49<br/>
Paladins		62.5<br/>
Rangers		48<br/>
<br/>
Warriors		223<br/>
Rogues		43<br/>
Monks			39<br/>
<br/>
Druids		196<br/>
Clerics		148<br/>
Shamans		143.5<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters		128<br/>
Necromancers	124<br/>
Wizards		78.5<br/>
Magicians		116<br/>
<br/>
Wizards are hugely underrepresented for an INT caster class and warriors are<br/>
by far the most common class on E&#39;ci.  How Anonymous affects these numbers<br/>
is undeterminable.<br/>
