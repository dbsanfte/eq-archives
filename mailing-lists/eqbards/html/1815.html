<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500957069">BAGPIPES! YES!<br/>
(oh, I, ahem, learning to play the bagpipes in RL)<br/>
<br/>
How about: Bagpipes, Wind Instrument, - Used with one of the AOE<br/>
	songs to cause some massive damage to creatures, while giving<br/>
	some sort of combat bonus?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm...Haggis, Food, - Set up with a skill level, like alcohol.<br/>
	higher skill level in Haggis eating gives you combat bonuses.<br/>
	lower skill level eating haggis will make you ill, and<br/>
	decrease combat abilities.<br/>
<br/>
How about a Barbarian Bard, using bagpipes for wind, bodhran for percussion,<br/>
	ram&#39;s horn for brass, etc., wearing a kilt, and carrying a claymore?<br/>
<br/>
Heh, I would love to play this race/class combo.  One big Scottish bard,<br/>
running around in a kilt, giving some sort of berserker bonuses to other<br/>
barbarians by virtue of playing the bagpipes.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well...just dreaming<br/>

&gt; &gt;Has anyone ever heard a war chant sung by people who are<br/>
&gt; actually about to<br/>
&gt; go into battle, actually<br/>
&gt; &gt;about to kill and be killed? I am not talking roleplaying combat, I mean<br/>
&gt; like, say Zulu war chants.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have (albeit in recording not EVEN in person) and they reach<br/>
&gt; down to the<br/>
&gt; base of your skull and<br/>
&gt; &gt;fire up your adrenal system like smelting furnace fed with pure oxygen.<br/>
&gt; ====================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand and agree!<br/>
&gt; I particularly enjoy the bagpipes played by Scots during the<br/>
&gt; Napoleonic War.<br/>
&gt; For some reason, for me anyway, several pipers playing their music gets me<br/>
&gt; blood boilin&#39;, lad!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know, not &quot;EQ related&quot; entirely, but I couldnt pass it up (smile)<br/>
