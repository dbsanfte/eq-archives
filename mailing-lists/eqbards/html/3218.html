<div id="ygrps-yiv-692460632">The short story is i went to kelethin and got a Dirk for 25 plat and i<br/>
love it. The long story follows :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, after hearing so many good things about the Dragoon Dirk (D&#39;Vinn&#39;s<br/>
dagger), i decided that i should return to my homeland of kelethin to<br/>
obtain one. So, with 40 plat in my pocket i set out from freeport to go<br/>
to CB to buy one. Winning one myself wasn&#39;t an option as i am only 14th<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Arriving in kelethin i began immediate /auctions &quot;looking for d&#39;vinns<br/>
dagger&quot;. I got a couple of replies that they would sell me one for 35,<br/>
but i thought i could do better. But then i answered an auction for a<br/>
Shiny Brass Shield for 17 plat (AC10 +10 magic resist, weight 8.0) i<br/>
couldn&#39;t resist as my wooden shield was on it&#39;s last leg and i bought<br/>
it. Then answered an auction for banded legs for 8 plat and one for<br/>
Bronze shoulders for 7(what a deal!).<br/>
<br/>
This left me with 8 plat and no dirk :(. So i went into CB to get some<br/>
cash. upon entering CB i ran into the trainer, killed him and got a SBS<br/>
for free!(good thing it&#39;s only PENDING LORE!) i then sold it for 20 plat<br/>
giving me 28 plat.<br/>
<br/>
Again i auctioned many times for dvinn&#39;s dagger, getting only one reply<br/>
still at 35 plat. So i joined a group killing oracles, legionaires etc.<br/>
The warlord showed up twice and we killed him. the second time we got<br/>
the bracers of battle which we split (20 plat for my share!). Feeling<br/>
good now, i auctioned for the dirk again ready to pay 35 and got it for<br/>
25!. On the way out i got a dwarven tunic for 15.<br/>
<br/>
With all the kills we made i had made some plat so: arriving in kelethin<br/>
with 40 plat i left with the Dirk, a SBS, banded legs, bronze shoulders,<br/>
and a dwarven tunic and 17 plat. Not bad for a days work!<br/>
<br/>
I highly reccommend getting the SBS for yourself. the trainer dosent<br/>
always drop it, but if you get it they seem to sell easily on Feydwer<br/>
for 20 plat and i hear 50 plat in freeport, guess i&#39;ll find out at 17<br/>
level :).<br/>
