	My bard is 28, and if I have to spend another day running around<br/>
chickenville in SK looking for Harriers and Avocets during primetime I am<br/>
going to go nuts.  I enjoy the charming in the outdoors and made it through<br/>
level 27 and half way in to 28 with out a scratch on me =).  Does anyone<br/>
know anything outdoors (especially static spawns) that is worth going after<br/>
at this level using charm?  The chickens were nice because the spawns were<br/>
static in the village.  I know there is Choon and Froon but they are<br/>
usually camped.  Though the centuar spawns in the stables are static I<br/>
found it to be a bit risky.</div>
