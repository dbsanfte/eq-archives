<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022346800">My personal opinion on the Guise change (i hope not inflamatory) :<br/>
<br/>
I think that the guise change is a good one, but they should have retroactively<br/>
changed the old ones as well.  What they should have (and should do still) is<br/>
put in a Bar/Trl/Ogr item that has unlimited charges of shrink...something like<br/>
&quot;Moggok&#39;s bracer of not being a big fata**&quot; or some such nonsense.  The Guise<br/>
was intended to be Brd/Rog only.  They should also put in an ultravision item<br/>
for da hummies.  (there is already an Infravision ring, right?)  I understand<br/>
the need  for the large races to be shrunk (been trapped in guk etc.) and i<br/>
understand that higher lvl humans should have some way to compensate for their<br/>
deficiencies.  I know that alot of people think &quot;Well, that&#39;s the racial<br/>
disadvantage&quot; which i partially agree with.  I do think that with work and<br/>
perserverence (read as &quot;Levels and Camping&quot;) they should be able to overcome<br/>
these disadvantages thru items.  But, it has bothered me since day one of<br/>
release that the guise was a bard/rogue only item that wasn&#39;t really.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Puts both feet firmly on soapbox&gt;<br/>
<br/>
However, i also think that if the Manastone is &quot;too Powerful&quot; it should be<br/>
removed entirely (maybe turn it into a diamond so that the people who camped<br/>
for it get some ROI)  <br/>
While i&#39;m at it...JBoots should have to be worn to be used IMSO.  I realize<br/>
that they are all/all, but if u wanna run fast, you should have to suffer the 0<br/>
AC detriment.  It seems obvious to me that was their intent initially.<br/>
...and maybe u should have to have your squad ring in the finger slot to use<br/>
the charge of heal....did i miss anything? :-)<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the old items on the people that already had it stratifies the EQ<br/>
population...Punishing those who did not start early, or were not lucky enough<br/>
to acquire the items before they were removed.  In the case of the Manastone,<br/>
it makes casters (specifically clerics and druids) that have them better than<br/>
those that don&#39;t, and with the manastone gone, the casters that don&#39;t have it<br/>
will always be &quot;inferior&quot; to those that do.  I realize this is kind of vague,<br/>
but this message is really long already....<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
