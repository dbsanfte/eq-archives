<b>Subject:</b> Purchasing from gypsies <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965736589">I have a question about purchasing items from the gypsies. I heard a rumor<br/>
that killing the bandits in Lesser Faydark negatively affects your faction<br/>
with the gypsies in addition to your faction with the Dervish Cutthroats.<br/>
When you kill a bandit, you get the message your faction with the Dervish<br/>
Cutthroats decreased, but no mention of the gypsies.  I haven&#39;t tried to<br/>
purchase anything from the gypsies yet because I have not adventured on<br/>
Antonica yet.  Just want to make sure that I&#39;m not hurting my faction with<br/>
them by killing bandits in Lesser Faydark.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
