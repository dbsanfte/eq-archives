<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519789332">I was too busy trying to escape to pay attention to what they were doing.<br/>
Apparently I didn&#39;t get everything on my trail and they got attacked before<br/>
they could get to their corpse.  They ended up zoning to escape dying a<br/>
second time.  Because it was easy for me to retrieve my corpse (near<br/>
Runnyeye zone), I ended up trying (and dying) a second time to get their<br/>
corpses.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the main reason I died the first time is because I had a DOT cast on<br/>
me.  As I was running to the zone, my health dropped low enough to slow me<br/>
down.  I was weaving Selos, Hymn, and the 22d level song (and even equipped<br/>
lute while running) .  Sure would have been nice if the 22d song had gotten<br/>
rid of the DOTs because I probably would have survived.    <br/>
