<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-965161597">Well, I killed a few giants last night in Velious and I got the expected faction<br/>
hits<br/>
<br/>
Faction with two giant clans went down (can&#39;t recall the names off the top of my<br/>
head)<br/>
Faction went up with Claws of Veeshan (dragons)<br/>
Faction went up with the Coldain.<br/>
<br/>
So, apparently the way it works is..<br/>
<br/>
Giants vs Dwarves<br/>
Giants vs Dragons<br/>
<br/>
Dwarves and Dragons don&#39;t appear to affect the faction of the either from what I<br/>
can tell.  So you could potentially<br/>
kill dwarves to gain faction with the giants and remain neutral with the<br/>
dragons.  Or kill dragons (the wurms I found<br/>
last night in the Western Wastes were all green to me at level 51) to improve<br/>
faction with giants and remain neutral<br/>
with Dwarves.  I&#39;ve decided to kill giants with my wizard to gain faction with<br/>
dwarves and dragons and to kill dragons<br/>
with my paladin to gain faction with giants.  I&#39;ll have to find something else<br/>
to kill to gain faction with the dwarves for<br/>
my paladin.  Speaking of factions, I also killed a few orcs in the zone adjacent<br/>
to Iceport, but with the faction bug, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t tell which factions were actually being affected.<br/>
<br/>
Also, entered a very very nasty dungeon.  It was an ice tower in the Western<br/>
Wastes.  Started with a K I believe.<br/>
Be careful in there.  Ended up falling off an icy ledge (note to self: use walk<br/>
on slippery slopes) and the only way<br/>
out led to a room full of Ice Kobolds that conned even to my 51 wiz.  I had to<br/>
gate all the way back to the Dragon<br/>
Bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Good news is..  It appears that most mobs in Velious actually can&#39;t see invis.<br/>
My wiz explored most of the Giant<br/>
city even though he&#39;s probably KOS there.  Only one giant could see invis, and<br/>
he appeared to be either a druid<br/>
or an enchanter since he was buffing mobs around him with a speed-related spell.<br/>
Also, every mob I encountered<br/>
outside of dungeons couldn&#39;t see invis.  And no mobs in that dungeon could see<br/>
invis besides a Kobold Prophet.<br/>
So, invis appears to be much more effective in Velious than it was in Kunark.<br/>
