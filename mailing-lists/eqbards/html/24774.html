<div id="ygrps-yiv-478573305">Very nice post.  This is my first &quot;eqbards&quot; email I have received I hope<br/>
they are all as well written and interesting to read.<br/>
<br/>
50+ zones good for pick-up groups?  I have formed several fruitful pickup<br/>
groups in Skyshrine and I have formed several total disasters.  This is a<br/>
zone that definitely requires people to listen well and know their role.<br/>
<br/>
A quick comment on the Power lvl&#39;d remark.  You only remember the bad ones<br/>
because the good ones don&#39;t say a thing about it.  You could say my warrior<br/>
is power lvl&#39;d.  Or you could say he grouped exclusively with my enchanter<br/>
from 1 to 45.  I think I started playing her mostly in &quot;regular&quot; groups<br/>
around 45 or 46 something like that.  All skills maxed with the exception of<br/>
2hb ( I didnt have a descent one the entire time so I didnt spend too much<br/>
time on it.)<br/>

Thanks for all the congrats. :)<br/>
<br/>
As for tips for leveling:<br/>
<br/>
We (my GF plays next to me in RL) tried to avoid pickup groups as much as<br/>
possible after around level 45, but rather tried to rely on creating groups<br/>
with people we knew were competent and dependable.  (The only way to find<br/>
those people is to join or start pickup groups and keep track of the good<br/>
team players and seek them out for future groups... And people you enjoy<br/>
being around!!!!  I can&#39;t stress that enough!)  Once you have a balanced (or<br/>
semi-balanced, we&#39;re bards afterall and can fill a few gaps :p) group of<br/>
competent players you can head just about anywhere.  50+ we spent mass<br/>
amounts of time at the zone-in in Chardok, various places in Sebilis,<br/>
Burning Woods, Skyfire, Trak&#39;s Teeth, etc.  Once Song of Twilight was fixed<br/>
(we have never had a reliable enchanter to group with) we started doing<br/>
Howling Stones - I think I was high 53 or low 54 at the time.  Around 55, we<br/>
spent a great deal of time in the Crypt in Sebilis trying for a BoH.  About<br/>
this time we decided to conc!<br/>
entrate on getting experience an<br/>
d sacrificing some major raid type stuff (Kael for Thurgadin armor pieces)<br/>
to do so.  56+ was almost ALL done in Howling Stones, but it almost requires<br/>
having your group set up prior to zoning in.  When you start taking people<br/>
to underpopulated dungeons with excellent rewards (exp!), they start seeking<br/>
you out.  We normally have the problem of not having enough group slots for<br/>
all the friends who want to join us on a given night :/.  Although, we<br/>
occasionally have the problem of not having a key class to do something...<br/>
But, that turns into an opportunity to meet more people  (/w all lfg 50<br/>
60)... it&#39;s a risk for that evening, but it could pay off in droves if they<br/>
prove to be competent.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of that whole networking for groups kinda thing can be done within a<br/>
guild, but don&#39;t limit yourself there.  We were unguilded (by specific<br/>
choice) until around level 45 and knew many many people from a variety of<br/>
different guilds that we considered friends.  I rarely looked at guild tags<br/>
prior to 45 (seems odd now, because that&#39;s one of the first things I notice<br/>
now, hehe) and still don&#39;t care or hold it against someone if they belong to<br/>
a certain guild or not... I&#39;ll care or hold it against them if they turn out<br/>
to be a jerk or repeatedly do something completely stupid to get evefyone<br/>
killed.  People make mistakes (I have made many that&#39;s gotten me and the<br/>
whole group killed, heh), but you can tell when it&#39;s done with good intent<br/>
but just a f-up or when it&#39;s due to extreme incompetence or apathy..<br/>
<br/>
So, to make a long story short, I wouldn&#39;t recommend pickup groups as a long<br/>
term strategy.. find people you like and trust and see the world with them.<br/>
Once you know everyone knows their role, you can go anywhere you want and do<br/>
fine.  (Stay away from twinks who have been powerleveled.. they usually<br/>
don&#39;t know their role!)<br/>

  BTW, if you have any tips for us on places you loved to hunt from 50 on<br/>
up, <br/>
  I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all love to hear about it. I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t have to worry<br/>
<br/>
  about pick-up groups, but I&#39;m also wondering if there are any 50+ zones <br/>
  where you can find a pick-up group and not die repeatedly. ;-)<br/>
