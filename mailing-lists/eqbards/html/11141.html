<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652772600">I&#39;d recommend the Mithril Breastplate. Above level 40 you will get no<br/>
further bonuses to your ac as a result of defense (max 200), so to help<br/>
deflect damage your only hope is a miss. the 125 Dodge Bards get will<br/>
not be much help. Against monsters in PoH the other night I left my log<br/>
on, then reviewed how I faired with EQ Char Info. With 160 agi (verses<br/>
was playing, no other agi buffs) I was hit 50% of the time and missed<br/>
50% of the time. A 50% miss rate is exceptional when all of the monsters<br/>
are L49-52. I don&#39;t wear either breastplate, but if I were to chose, it<br/>
would be the Mithril hands down.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also worth noting charisma affects resistance on more than just<br/>
charm, many songs have their resist rate based on CHA, just like a<br/>
shaman&#39;s debuff attacks (such as Disempower and Malise series).<br/>
<br/>
because a Mithril Breastplate isn&#39;t easy to obtain, the Lambent quest is<br/>
a great alternative. Another good option is a Brigadine Tunic.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;   You could really argue most of the lambent armor is so-so,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the mithbp with it&#39;s agi boost, gives you equal if not better<br/>
&gt; &gt;   ac than the lambentbp.  And azure sleeves have more ac than<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the lambent arms, minus the minor saves and cha.  I personally<br/>
&gt; &gt;   wear all lambent to look good.  I will use the non-visible spots<br/>
&gt; &gt;   to tweak my stats to where I&#39;d like them to be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have to disagree on the Lambent BP vs Mithril BP. I get more AC and more<br/>
&gt; HP from the Lambent BP.  My Agl is 100 btw (without the MBP). </span></blockquote></div>
