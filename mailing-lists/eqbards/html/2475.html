<b>Subject:</b> Exp question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363107196">I&#39;ve noticed that when I hunt one thing (for instance,  blue-con gnoll<br/>
revers in EK), my experience slowly crawls upward depending very little on<br/>
the con.  Now, if I happen to mix up the kills a bit (mebbe kill a war wolf<br/>
that&#39;s a light blue or dark green-con, or a lion, or pretty much anything<br/>
else that will give exp but is not a gnoll of some type), my experience<br/>
jumps!  I&#39;ve made around a bubble to 2 bubbles of exp over a 2-hour (killing<br/>
blue cons, mostly) by doing this, while just going after only 1 type of<br/>
creature (despite the con or creature) gets me less than half the exp.  Has<br/>
anyone else noticed this or have an explanation?<br/>
