&gt; Pure caster and priest types definitely cap at 255 (in-game <br/>
&gt; spouse is a 50 <br/>
&gt; cleric). Good question about the hybrids though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i guess it lies in what Verant thinks we are, which if it comes down to it,<br/>
regardless of how we feel, is probably a hybrid.  and if the hybrids are<br/>
capped at 200, we may be stuck there too (until expansion i guess).<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I TOTALLY disagree with our musical skills capping at 200. I <br/>
&gt; mean I think <br/>
&gt; i&#39;m doing ok with 200, but a Bard&#39;s main skills are song. <br/>
&gt; Without song we <br/>
&gt; are basically a nerfed, useless version of every class <br/>
&gt; (except our tracking <br/>
&gt; being superior to druids MUAHAHAHA... j/k). Song defines us. <br/>
&gt; Magic defines a <br/>
&gt; wizard. Why the hell should they get 255 and not us?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is how i have been feeling the more and more i think about it.<br/>

&gt; Where is the petition? I&#39;d like to sign it...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not sure if it was this list or another onelist bards list.  a<br/>
letter/petition of sorts was sent to GZ, after a month we get a response.<br/>
not all we wanted, but answers at least.  i don&#39;t think we put skill caps in<br/>
the letter.  but we all have <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gzatkin@...">gzatkin@...</a> if we want to use it.<br/>
