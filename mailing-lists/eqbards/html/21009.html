<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006090828">Although it pains me to say it, I have found SoW to be extremely useful<br/>
lately...<br/>
Sitting in my normal solo spot just South of the FV giant camp, I came upon<br/>
a nifty idea:<br/>
Instead of me using Chains (which seems to have a really silly resist rate<br/>
vs blues sometimes) to slow my victim (drolvarg snarler or growler), and<br/>
have to spend my time rotating 3 songs which may or may not stick, why not<br/>
just get a SoW and drop Chains from the rotation while just juggling my 2<br/>
chants with my Tamborine?<br/>
*looks around for any VI employees*<br/>
It works so well that I can pull multiple doggies, find a nice spot to run<br/>
in a circle, and DoT the bejeezus outta them (my current record is 2<br/>
growlers and 1 snarler, non-stop without being hit once.  Woulda been more,<br/>
but in an earlier pull a froggie shaman got into the mix :o/  )<br/>
All I do is run around and grab some pups, go back to my lil spot (using the<br/>
rocks as a marler for when to turn), aand begin juggling DoTs.  When one<br/>
dies, I switch views, target another, then do it again, rinse and repeat<br/>
until all pups are dead.  Just in case ye start runnin low on stamina, have<br/>
Jig mem&#39;d ;o)<br/>
