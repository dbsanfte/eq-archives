<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297045542">For some reason, those last few point of defence take a long time to get.<br/>
At least they did for me.  If I remember correctly, it was a few levels<br/>
after I hit 40 (or was it 39?) that this skill finally maxed.<br/>

No.  My current arsenal is:<br/>
Crystalline Blade<br/>
Enamelled Black Mace<br/>
<br/>
The mace is 8/28, and although it&#39;s bulbous head is wearing on me, it&#39;s<br/>
certainly prettier than the ugly stick.  The blade is 11/38, and compared<br/>
to the Runed Falchion (11/34, 4kpp and the thick offbalanced look of a<br/>
scimitar) is plenty for my job.<br/>
<br/>
I recently finished maxing most melee skills (slashing with the whips,<br/>
piercing with Mithril Quill/Dirk, blunt with EB Mace and FS Hammer<br/>
(5/30)), but defense eludes me.  I&#39;m still 6 points short of the 200 cap,<br/>
meaning a lot of ac is waiting to be had.  I tried loading up on int gear<br/>
and getting myself beat up by guards (a newbie asked me what I was doing,<br/>
I told him I was masochistic -.-) to no avail.  For a while I even used<br/>
the Lariats exclusively to attract attention to get hit more, but that<br/>
didn&#39;t pay off either.<br/>
