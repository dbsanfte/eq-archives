<div id="ygrps-yiv-251825571">Last night, I was grouped with a necromancer in MM.  There were only a<br/>
handful of people in the zone so we decided to pull the mobs back to the<br/>
zone and fight there.  On one occasion, I pulled two familiars that we were<br/>
handling just fine.  Out of nowhere, a flouting gargoyle appeared.  None of<br/>
the other people in the zone were nearby so I know for a fact they didn&#39;t<br/>
lead the gargoyle to us.  At the time the garg appeared, the necro was over<br/>
75% health.  In an instant, he got zapped by something and was killed.  He<br/>
checked his text window to see what zapped him but couldn&#39;t find an<br/>
explanantion.  Later on, I made a similar pull.  This time I got three<br/>
familiars by mistake.  They all attacked me so I started to sing Lullaby and<br/>
put them to sleep.  Once again, out of nowhere, three flouting gargoyles<br/>
appeared right on top of us.  I was around 60% health at the time.  Before I<br/>
had a chance to even start running to the zone, I got zapped and was knocked<br/>
from 60% to dead in one shot.  Like the necro earlier, there weren&#39;t any<br/>
text messages to indicate I should have taken that much damage in one shot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am inclined to believe that our deaths were a result of a bug, which I&#39;m<br/>
told sometimes occurs in MM.  First off, the gargs spawned right next to the<br/>
zone, which I am almost certain shouldn&#39;t have occured.  Everyone in the<br/>
zone were in their 20s and camping around the lake.  I don&#39;t know where<br/>
flouting gargoyles normally spawn, but I would assume nowhere near where<br/>
everyone was pulling from (the pathway leading to the graveyard).  I can&#39;t<br/>
think of any reason how the flouting gargs got to the zone except due to a<br/>
bug.  Second, the text messages did not indicate I got hit by a spell, which<br/>
could have accounted for losing 60% of my health in one shot.  Even if I did<br/>
get hit by a spell, the damage that familiars can do in one shot (usually<br/>
with Force Shock), shouldn&#39;t be over 400 hit points.  I did get hit for<br/>
physical damage by the gargs but not enough to do 400 hit points of health,<br/>
which was about what I had when they appeared.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had similar deaths in MM? <br/>
