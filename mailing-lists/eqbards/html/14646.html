&gt; things I expected to do when I got to 50.  Lets assume after the expansion<br/>
&gt; (with a level cap of 60) that it now takes a 55+ person to go on a<br/>
&gt; dragon/plane raid.  If I understand what your saying, then I should just<br/>
&gt; remain patient until I get to 55th level and then go on raids then (12<br/>
&gt; months from now versus 6 months from now).  If this is the case, then sorry<br/>
&gt; but I don&#39;t agree with you.  If it takes me 6 months to get to 50 and go on<br/>
&gt; a dragon raid, then I can accept that and be patient.  But if the rules get<br/>
&gt; changed and I now have to wait 12 months before I can go on a dragon raid,<br/>
&gt; then I won&#39;t accept that.  I&#39;ll either retire my bard and play a different<br/>
&gt; class or quit the game entirely.<br/>

are really really stupid?  :)<br/>
<br/>
Their problem is that they&#39;re trying to raise the bar by<br/>
stretching the levels already in place, instead of adding more<br/>
levels to the top end.  By stretching, you create the<br/>
situation where the rate of stretching exceeds the rate of<br/>
some people&#39;s progression, which means those folks end up<br/>
going backwards.  I&#39;m not sure anymore if Verant really<br/>
understands that the non-45-50 folks are their bread and<br/>
butter customers.<br/>
<br/>
I sympathize with you folks still between L10-35, but<br/>
understand that it&#39;s been frustrating for me and my L45<br/>
friends as well.  I put off playing in Sol B when I was 30-35<br/>
because I figured I would have plenty of time to get a box of<br/>
Abu Kar.  Verant took it out of the game.  We put off camping<br/>
the Evil Eye for manastones because we were having so much fun<br/>
fighting other mobs in LGuk.  Verant removed manastones the<br/>
following week.  As I&#39;m closing in on the level required for<br/>
planes trips, Verant radically reduces the frequency of planes<br/>
item drops.  And now that I&#39;ve started to join dragon raids,<br/>
Verant boosts the difficulty of the dragons.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to see long-term goals getting put further and<br/>
further away.  Quite another to see things you were planning<br/>
to do next week or next month made more difficult or<br/>
impossible.  I&#39;m liking the luck-based rare drop system I<br/>
proposed more and more.<br/>
