<b>Subject:</b> a couple neat solo-bard tricks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075541864">I for one, a lvl 13 bard now, have solo-ed pretty much all of the time(first<br/>
character corrupted :( trying to powerlevel up to my friends)<br/>
<br/>
1. Accelerando, i keep this hotkeyed at all times, its the ultimate get out<br/>
of death free card.also, with your drum , you are the fastest person in the<br/>
game, and gam go from qeynos to freeport in about 10 minutes real time :)<br/>
<br/>
2. Hymn of Restoration , not really practical during a fight, but excellent<br/>
at reducing your &quot;downtime&quot; or rest period between fights. also a wonder for<br/>
counteracting the effects of poison.<br/>
<br/>
3. Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow - this is my favorite spell, bar none. why? it<br/>
does 7dmg at lvl 12, my lvl 19 friend says his now does 11 per tick, and its<br/>
a targetted spell, unlike others, it will only affect the monster you target<br/>
. others are area effect and are very dangerous because they will harm other<br/>
monsters . my favorite tactic with this is to attack a wisp, then run off<br/>
(wisps are slow and you can outrun them without Accelerando) and while the<br/>
wisp is chasing me, i am bellowing at it and its taking damage. This is not<br/>
the fastest way to kill a monster, but wisps are great XP and have nice loot<br/>
as well, and its a relatively safe way to fight :)<br/>
<br/>
4. Charismatic Carillon - i always play this whenever i buy or sell from<br/>
NPCs, because i get better prices. this song pays for itself :)<br/>
<br/>
thats all i have for now, i&#39;ll post more as soon as i get some more levels<br/>
