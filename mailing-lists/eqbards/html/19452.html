-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This thread will need to be closed due to its size soon. When someone<br/>
reposts the issue, I&#39;d prefer it if you could remove the items that we&#39;ve<br/>
commented on, or at least indicate its status.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten word on many of the issues from various members of the team:<br/>
<br/>
Purity and Vitality are fixed in code. It should be live now. If it isn&#39;t,<br/>
it is on test and will be live at the next client patch.<br/>
<br/>
Kellin&#39;s has been referred to our testing department.<br/>
<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s Concord is confirmed and agreed as bug. The client programmer has it<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s Constant Chain is in testing.<br/>
<br/>
Angstlich&#39;s Appauling Screech: Fear spells do not cause NPCs to stop<br/>
casting. Works as intended. <br/>
<br/>
Solidarity of Vision: Works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Johthan&#39;s Provocation: We&#39;ve reduced the fizzle rate and added the message.<br/>
Remainder works as intended. Changes are live.<br/>
<br/>
Niv&#39;s: Works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Song of Travel: Opinions requested and placed on the board. I believe the<br/>
consensus was to remove the invis component, yes?<br/>
<br/>
Largo&#39;s: Range has been increased. Changes are live. Still looking into PvP<br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Nillipus&#39;: Works as intended currently. We&#39;re open to removing the damage<br/>
shield component if you wish. Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Song of Twilight: Works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Assonant Strain: fixed as requested.<br/>
<br/>
Bombastic Bellow: Fixed and live.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Broken Quest Issues&quot; are not broken quests. They are preexisting<br/>
stories for future expansion.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kunark Armor&quot;: Well my list says &quot;fixed&quot; but I don&#39;t have what they ment by<br/>
that. If any changes have been made they would be live.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it for this installment</div>
