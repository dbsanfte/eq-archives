<div id="ygrps-yiv-211695637">I have just recieved a Pugius the night of Wed 15th of Sept, in Unrest on<br/>
the Brell Server, from a Lesser Blade Fiend.  He spawned on the first floor.<br/>
Here is the story.<br/>
<br/>
I as a 19th Human Bard, was in a party with one 20th lvl Paladin, a 23rd<br/>
level Bard named Elsin (great guy) and three other mid - low twenties<br/>
characters.  It was my turn to pull, so I was using my newly aquired<br/>
invisibility, ( I find it works on most blue undead ).  I stepped into the<br/>
Building from the left side patio door, and just inside I saw the Lesser<br/>
Blade Fiend.  It consisded of about a dozen various weapons/shields swirling<br/>
in a tornado-like fashion.  I looked at it for a bit, it /con&#39;d high blue to<br/>
me at 19th.  I diddn&#39;t look like it was pulled to this spot, it looked like<br/>
it spawned there, (it was standing where spawns normaly apprear).  I stood<br/>
there in awe for a bit telling my party what I had found, they started<br/>
telling Get It.. Get It.. so I did.  We killed it quickly, and when it died<br/>
all of the weapons and shields fell to the ground.  As the lowest member of<br/>
the party I was getting the usual slim pickins, but no one wanted the<br/>
Pugius.  It is now an excellent addition to my Dragoon Dirk.  I feel like a<br/>
blender...:)<br/>

Months ago I bought the Pugius Dagger to dual wield with my dragoon dirk<br/>
since the delay was so low and it works vs magic only monsters.  I was a<br/>
shish-kebob machine doing 10 damage with Pugius and 12 damage with Dragoon<br/>
Dirk for as much as 22 straight melee damage about every 2.2 seconds.  The<br/>
Silvery War Axe that fetches 400pp on the PC market has an attack delay of<br/>
22 and damage 6 vs the Pugius&#39; delay 21 damage 5 and they weigh the same.<br/>
The Bladed Thulian Claws have an attack delay of 19 and damage of 5.  Pugius<br/>
is an EXCELLENT piercing weapon for Bards in their teens who decide to go<br/>
with piercing, however, one thing eludes me:<br/>
<br/>
Where is this weapon found?!?<br/>
<br/>
I have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend in<br/>
Unrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>
told they do not exist.  I never see anyone using this weapon, nor do I see<br/>
anyone selling it...is it a limited release artifact now?  Who knows the<br/>
mysterious secret of the origin of the Pugius Dagger?<br/>
