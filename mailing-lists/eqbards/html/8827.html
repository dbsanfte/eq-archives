whacking at another mob.  I didn&#39;t recharm my pet in time when<br/>
my party killed the other mob, and its corpse went *poof*.  <br/>
I&#39;m assuming the charmed mob&#39;s damage is tallied separately<br/>
from the party&#39;s damage.  There are enough potential bugs with<br/>
charm in determining group aggregate damage that it makes my<br/>
head spin.<br/>
