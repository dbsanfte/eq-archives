&gt;Does anyone think that bards should not be limited to memorizing only<br/>
&gt;eight songs at a time?  I just made 20th level and for the first time<br/>
&gt;had to think really hard on what songs I wanted to memorize.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem with this.<br/>
&gt;Many of their spells at higher levels are just improved versions of<br/>
&gt;spells they had at lower levels.  They don&#39;t really have to worry about<br/>
&gt;memorizing their low level spells once they reach a certain point.  That<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t the case for us.  With a few exceptions, almost all of our songs<br/>
&gt;each have their own unique effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

bard.  I have 7 useful buffs (mana&#39;s the limiting factor), 3 useful<br/>
damage spells (1 dd + 2 stackable DoTs), 1 good debuff (slows<br/>
attack speed).  Fortunately I get double duty out of the buff Inner<br/>
Fire.  It restores hit points, as well as upping your total.  It is actually<br/>
more mana efficient than minor or lesser healing (1-1 mana for hp, where<br/>
Inner Fire is 1-1.9 at level 9).  I never have this much trouble deciding<br/>
which songs to mem.<br/>
<br/>
At higher levels it gets worse, as there are more buffs and debuffs<br/>
that all stack (quickness and regeneration at 24).<br/>
<br/>
Part of the strategy of playing these classes is spell/song selection,<br/>
so I doubt we&#39;ll ever see more spell slots.</div>
