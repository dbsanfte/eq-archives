<b>Subject:</b> Getting a good item!  and selling it <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-87084558">Greetings again!<br/>
<br/>
Fflewduer here to offer &#39;is two copper&#39;s worth on this long subject.<br/>
<br/>
The other night I came by Zarhan&#39;s Coronet!  I was level 18 (19 <br/>
now..hurrah!!) and I looked at the stats and found I could not equip this <br/>
item.  So...I offered it to the party.  They laughed their butts off!  They <br/>
said why would I want to give away for free an item that sells for 500pp?  <br/>
What?!?  I can get this kind of money for it?  Wow! Well, can anybody use it <br/>
or not?  They say no.  So I tell guild.  They say to sell it.  So I auction <br/>
it....but I am reasonable.  I state in my auction the worth of this item and <br/>
then say I will take far less for a deserving person.  A level 30 shaman <br/>
answers that he would like to buy the item.  So I sold it for 300pp.  Am I <br/>
bad?  I was in leather up to level 14.  Now I have bronze and banded.  I had <br/>
a fs long sword and a fs scimitar (which I lost on a looting bug).  Now I <br/>
have a dragoon dirk and a combine long sword.  I have plenty of cash in the <br/>
bank now too.  So....was I wrong to sell?  No!  I have played the game to <br/>
the hilt.  I couldn&#39;t equip the item.  Somebody else has wanted it for a <br/>
long time and could afford the price I asked.  Did they cheat?  No!  So I <br/>
guess I am saying that if a person hits the lottery jackpot, they should be <br/>
able to enjoy it. I think we have several people here on the list who agree <br/>
with this in part or in whole.<br/>
<br/>
One point I would like to make is that an experienced person has stated that <br/>
selling an item you can use may not be wise since you will probably want it <br/>
later.  I think we are confusing two issues here.  To sell or keep being one <br/>
issue.  To have alot of money at a realatively low level being another.<br/>
<br/>
First may I address keeping valuable items?  Ok...if I had that crown I <br/>
would keep it.  I don&#39;t really need it, but I don&#39;t really need the money <br/>
either.  So I would keep it.  If I came across a money crunch though, I <br/>
would sell stuff to get what I want.  I have a cleric friend that literally <br/>
sold all his armour (when we were in low teens) to buy spells.  Was that <br/>
wise?  Got me.  But he had his spells which made the party stronger.  And he <br/>
had our sympathy so we made sure that all armour loots went to him.  Plus we <br/>
bought auctioned gear we could afford.  If you solo though....choose well!<br/>
<br/>
Second let&#39;s visit having bnch of money at low level.  There are rich <br/>
families in the real world.  These families have kids that drive cars I <br/>
dream about.  Am I jealous?  Hell yeah!  A 16 year old kid in a brand new <br/>
Corvette is always sure to set my teeth on edge.  That is life.  Some people <br/>
will always have more/better stuff.  If i was a multi-bizzillionaire I would <br/>
buy family nice stuff too.  So in a virtual world if I see a level one guy <br/>
running around with a full bronze plate and a deadly weapon running for the <br/>
guards to hide from two firebeetles I laugh.  To me it is like a rich kid.  <br/>
He&#39;s not better than me, he has better stuff.  He doesn&#39;t bother me a bit.<br/>
<br/>
One last point to make.  One person mentioned that a character that was <br/>
outfitted well had little reason to fulfill quests that provided items of <br/>
less value than currently equiped.  Also along this line of thought it was <br/>
stated that a character may not get the full value out of the game because <br/>
one needn&#39;t go to all of the apropriate areas for the level (Crushbone, <br/>
Oasis, etc.)and wouldn&#39;t be able to relate to others tactics on handling <br/>
these places.  Hmmm.  There&#39;s much to say on this, but want to try to keep <br/>
it short and to a point.   I haven&#39;t been to all the places &quot;appropriate to <br/>
my level&quot; with my Bard.  I have been to some, and linger in ones I like.  <br/>
Also the places are far apart.  My real world time is precious, and running <br/>
halfway across the world (or farther) just to see if I may like a place or <br/>
not is not a practical thought.  If I like a place, get good exp, have <br/>
friends in the area (through grouping with different groups), then why <br/>
should I leave?  Am I missing the &quot;full value&quot; of the game?  I think not.  I <br/>
can start a character someday closer to places my Bard hasn&#39;t visited.  I <br/>
WILL see everything, eventually.  One thing to keep in mind is that we all <br/>
have a different idea of getting the most out of EQ.  I am social.  If my <br/>
party wants to move, we move.  I don&#39;t say &quot;I am outta here!  One more level <br/>
and I won&#39;t enjoy Crushbone anymore!&quot;  That would be unfair to the party.  <br/>
To sum up this little tirade, this is a subjective issue.  I have seen high <br/>
evel people in Crushbone, trying to complete a quest for lower levels.  Are <br/>
they annoying low level people?  Oh yeah!  Why are they there?  To complete <br/>
a quest that is fun and challenging to figure out.  If I start out in <br/>
Qeynos, with a monk, I would level up a good bit before trying to cross some <br/>
hard zones to get to Freeport.  Then I would work my way to Kelethin.  By <br/>
the time I got to Crushbone I would probably too powerful for it.  But I <br/>
would go anyway if I heard there was a good quest there.<br/>
<br/>
Ok!  I lied!  I told you 2 copper&#39;s worth and then gave you a gold piece!  <br/>
These are just some of my thoughts on the subjects.  I don&#39;t want us to <br/>
argue over subjective things like value of items and value of game play.  I <br/>
like debate.  I know that I am basically supporting a side on this topic, <br/>
but I hope any opposing view points don&#39;t take offense!  I used examples to <br/>
address them not to attack the person who originated.  I believe we all <br/>
really like being Bards, and I believe that we are all decent people!  We <br/>
should get along just fine!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;OK. Let me start off by saying I too dislike twinking. That said, THE <br/>
&gt;CHARACTER<br/>
&gt;IN QUESTION GOT THE ITEM WITHIN THE RULES OF THE GAME BY DOING A QUEST! How <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;that a twink? He got the item fair and square so shouldn&#39;t it be his to do <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;as he wishes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Jeez people, crawl down off your soapbox once in a while.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked <br/>
&gt;players<br/>
&gt; &gt; because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our<br/>
&gt; &gt; behinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing <br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt; &gt; in part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford<br/>
&gt; &gt; buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that<br/>
&gt; &gt; until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with <br/>
&gt;pieces<br/>
&gt; &gt; (or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate<br/>
&gt; &gt; would I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; play. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them -<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. <br/>
&gt;It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; not a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; most out of EQ.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Twinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13.<br/>
