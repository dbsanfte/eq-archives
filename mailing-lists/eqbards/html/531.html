<div id="ygrps-yiv-842327659">When you find this song, please please please don&#39;t post where you<br/>
found it to this board. And if you absolutley must post it, at least<br/>
put a whole lot of spoiler markings on it. I really would enjoy finding<br/>
it myself.<br/>

The drawback about being Level 30 my friend is that you get to find the<br/>
song and then later tell all of us where it is . . . <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have never seen it mentioned in any list. I hope it<br/>
exists .<br/>

&gt;Does anyone know what the level 30 song is and where<br/>
&gt;to find it?  Or who to talk to if it is (as I have heard) a<br/>
&gt;quest item?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
