<div id="ygrps-yiv-504399289">There is a Summon Corpse spell.  Your corpse can be pulled from anywhere in<br/>
the current zone to the feet of the caster (necro I believe.)  Also rumored<br/>
to require a reagent (black enameled coffin???) not yet located on mobs or<br/>
vendors.  <br/>
<br/>
Any info?<br/>
<br/>

p.s. saw a post and person asked what mob in Paw dropped this spell. Not<br/>
sure if he meant spell or the reagent.</div>
