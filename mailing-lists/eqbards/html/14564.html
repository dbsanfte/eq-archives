<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000202993">OK I know we shouldn&#39;t this list for bragging, personal accomplishments, etc.<br/>
but I had such a great time in Kedge over the weekend that I have to share it<br/>
with my bard friends on this list.<br/>
Over the weekend I participated in another Kedge raid.  We had 19 people in the<br/>
raid.  There wasn&#39;t any enchanters in the raid and only one other bard.  So once<br/>
again, even though I was the lowest level player in the raid, everyone was glad<br/>
to have me around for clarity, stamina and resist songs.<br/>
After we got all the groups organized, we moved down to the shark room (I think<br/>
thats what its called), we killed whatever shark drops a shark tooth(5/18<br/>
piercer). I got lucky and won the roll (around 10 people rolled for the item).<br/>
This was a better weapon than what I was currently wielding (thulian claws and<br/>
obsidian shard). After we cleaned out that area we moved on to another area to<br/>
prepare for the attack on Estrella. On the way, we killed a golden hair mermaid.<br/>
None of the rangers present needed the mermaid hair for the Raincaller quest so<br/>
I was given permission to loot the hair. I can now complete the Mane Attraction<br/>
(+10 charisma toupee, nice item for bards) quest. <br/>
We then decided to pull Estrella.  The raid leader warned everyone that Estrella<br/>
could dispell everyone&#39;s Enduring Breath buffs so be prepared.  I told my group<br/>
I would have ER and GR weaved to help prevent that from happening to us.  The<br/>
main puller told everyone to focus on killing Estrella first and then whatever<br/>
else got pulled.  I should have paid better attention at that point but I was<br/>
caught up in the moment and did not consider the ramifications of what he said.<br/>
I started weaving ER and GR as soon as the puller yelled INC.  When Estrella got<br/>
pulled, four gloomwater mermaids came with her.  Because everyone was focused on<br/>
Estrella, I quickly moved up the hate list for the other four mermaids.  I ended<br/>
up dying in less than 5 seconds due to the bard hate factor.  I died so fast the<br/>
cleric in my group didn&#39;t even have time to target me for a heal.  I felt kinda<br/>
bad because I was the only person who ended up dying but it wasn&#39;t a big deal<br/>
coz I got an EXP res. In hindsight, it would have been smarter if some of the<br/>
tanks meleed the mermaids to get their attention.  Or perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
started to weave ER and GR until after the battle started.    <br/>
The raid turned sour at that point because someone ninja looted a Rod of Drones<br/>
from Estrella.  We were planning on moving on to Phingiel but a lot of people<br/>
were pissed and left.  We ended up moving back towards the entrance and tried to<br/>
pull Bubble with the 9 people who decided to stay.  When we discovered that<br/>
Bubble hadn&#39;t spawned, most everyone decided to split. <br/>
On the way out, I got lost and ended up dieing when a bunch of stuff attacked<br/>
me. Someone was able to pull my corpse to the zone and I got another EXP a res.<br/>
After that, me, a 38 ranger and a 45 warrior decided to pull stuff to the zone.<br/>
A few minutes later a 35 mage showed up and we added him.  The warrior pulled a<br/>
fierce impaler (rare spawn near the zone) so we zoned to avoid anymore deaths.<br/>
We tried to recruit people in Dagnor&#39;s to help us kill the impaler but no one<br/>
would come. The ranger decided to call it a night. A few minutes later the<br/>
cleric who was originally in my group logged back in and heard us recruiting. He<br/>
agreed to help us and so we went back in. Thanks largely to the cleric&#39;s<br/>
Retributions, we were able to kill the fierce impaler. The group leader<br/>
/randomed 1000 to determine the range for everyone to roll for the loot. He came<br/>
up with 483. I did a /random 1 483 and almost shit my britches when I rolled a<br/>
483 on the nose. Everyone in the party said they had never seen that happen<br/>
before using that looting method. I am now the proud owner of a Gloomwater<br/>
harpoon (piercer, 9/31 +4STR, +25HP, only 3lbs), far and away the best weapon<br/>
I&#39;ve ever had. <br/>
So this weekend in Kedge I was the luckiest bard on E&#39;ci. I was the only person<br/>
in the raid who died(twice) but I came out of the raid with two weapons better<br/>
than the ones I went in with. Two deaths:two great weapons...poetic justice,<br/>
kizmet, coincidence or whatever, I&#39;ll take it :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you are a 32+ bard and want to try something new, I strongly encourage you to<br/>
give Kedge a try.  Your presense will be greatly appreciated.  Its one helluva<br/>
zone as well.  <br/>

PS I made 34th level while in Kedge as well.  That was icing on the cake:-)</div>
