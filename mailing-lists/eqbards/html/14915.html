<br/>
&gt;Our current invis song works against the undead.  I&#39;ve walked unmolested<br/>
&gt;throughout all of Unrest (including a fully spawned basement and third<br/>
 </span></blockquote>floor)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;enough times to verify this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had this a while back, while our invis song make work in unrest it does<br/>
not work in Lower guk, once you hit level 35+ you are gonna want to start<br/>
going to Lower guk, so having our level 39 song invis to undead would be<br/>
useful. I often have to wait at the zone until I can get an invis.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;does a massive group heal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now I like this idea, very good. Makes the bard a kind of 1 off life saver<br/>
for the group. thus increasing the bards value to a group!!<br/>
