<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508250109"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Emperor Crush - The dude that runs the whole show. If you take him<br/>
&gt; down, you get a real nice piece of small magical ringmail...Royal<br/>
&gt; Guard - A orc ROGUE if you believe it...I do, because his backstab is<br/>
&gt; brutalLord Darish - Haven&#39;t met up with him often (Even as my level 15<br/>
&gt; Warrior alter ego) Not sure what good he is...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe Darish also carries some special axe, although I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; certian. he spawns in the &quot;throne room&quot;<br/>
&gt;  The Prophet - An oracle on steroids... Emisarry - The orc with a<br/>
&gt; mission...To whack you over and over and over with his spear. Really,<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s quite good at his job...Ambassador D&#39;vinn - Dark Elf with an<br/>
&gt; attitude. This is THE bad guy of the whole area. Not sure what level<br/>
&gt; he is, but it usually takes a group to nuke him. Awesome dagger<br/>
&gt; (Dragoon Dirk) to be found when he falls though (Hint: If you&#39;re not<br/>
&gt; on his hate list, don&#39;t attack orcs near him...He might ignore you if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re not fighting!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dvinn seems to also have a racial hatred toward Wood Elves, as does<br/>
&gt; Dorn in the 2nd Northern Ro Dervish Camp. Maybe the hatred is toward<br/>
&gt; bards, but I&#39;m inclined to believe it&#39;s actually Wood Elves. Perhaps<br/>
&gt; all Dark Elves (NPCs) have this dislike? BTW, Dvinn ALWAYS has the<br/>
&gt; dagger, so at least you know if you actually do beat him, you will get<br/>
&gt; it. It is also now a Lore Item, which is a good change to reduce overt<br/>
&gt; camping in my opinion. DVinn often has the Black Heart for the Paladin<br/>
&gt; Quest, but not always.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The scariest thing is The Prophet does is buff DVinn and Crush with<br/>
&gt; Spirit of the Wolf. I had no idea he was doing this, and I remember<br/>
&gt; being mowed down by a train of Dvinn, Crush, etc when I was in CB at<br/>
&gt; lower levels. It&#39;s a pretty nasty thing of him to do. ;p He sometimes<br/>
&gt; has Tergon&#39;s Spellbook, a lore item. I believe this is for a quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went to Crushbone the other day at Level 19, and Crushbone was a<br/>
&gt; blue con but to me was like fighting 2 dervish thugs at 17th or 18th,<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t take him alone. The Prophet was VERY easy to kill. Dvinn -<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even consider it. I paired up with a L24 druid the first go<br/>
&gt; around to get a Dragoon Dirk, and the only reason Dvinn died was<br/>
&gt; because the druid was a monster. DVinn was 19th-20th everytime we<br/>
&gt; spawned. Even splitting the exp with a L24, I got literally a quarter<br/>
&gt; bubble exp off of him. The Dragoon Dirk however is an awesome weapon,<br/>
&gt; and is even better then the Combine long sword I used. It seems with<br/>
&gt; alot of these that bronze armor puts you over the edge in taking hits<br/>
&gt; from them, I was still in 90% banded when I went, and wielded a<br/>
&gt; Combine LS and a FS LS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  These two are found elsewhere and are of note, because they can get<br/>
&gt; hard to kill at lower levels... Trainer - Found WAY on top of the hill<br/>
&gt; overlooking the castle. People camp this area heavily because he will<br/>
&gt; drop a Shiny Brass Shield (AC10, +10vsMagic, Lightstone)Taskmaster -<br/>
&gt; Slaver Boss. Has a nice leather whip to reach out and touch someone<br/>
&gt; with...Actually found behind the castle.Rondo - Dwarven Bandit found<br/>
&gt; in the mines. He appears to be cooperating with the orcs. Good reason<br/>
&gt; to ice him. The rest of the crew to be found around (in order from<br/>
&gt; easiest to kill to hardest to kill IMO) are Pawns, Centurion, Oracles,<br/>
&gt; Slavers, and Legionnaires. At your level, this will pretty much be the<br/>
&gt; meat of your hunting. If you are soloing, don&#39;t even step foot on the<br/>
&gt; island that has the castle unless you&#39;ve got your drums at the ready.<br/>
&gt; My piece of advice...Learn where the Legionnaire&#39;s spawn and avoid<br/>
&gt; (unless you can take a Legionnaire) and avoid the mine unless you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; with a group, or there is already one camped inside. Occasionally if<br/>
&gt; you kill a slaver, they drop keys. Use these keys to gain the<br/>
&gt; appreciation of the slaves scattered around the area. If you give a<br/>
&gt; slave a copper piece, he will read the number of his shackles so you<br/>
&gt; can match the keys up....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WOW! I didn&#39;t know about the copper. Now I can go use those keys I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been collecting in the bank. Great tip.<br/>

<br/>
There is also a very rare spawn called &quot;the warlord&quot;, he can have a<br/>
Bracer of Battle. It&#39;s a very good piece of armor I hear in its own<br/>
right, but you also need it to complete the quest for the screaming<br/>
mace, along with the shiny brass shield.<br/>
