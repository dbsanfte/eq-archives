&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nope they don&#39;t make backups regularly.  But they&#39;ve had to do quick<br/>
&gt;rollbacks before.  If you haven&#39;t played regularly on test and don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt;the environment please don&#39;t make blatant generalizations.  Typically the<br/>
&gt;backups are about 2 weeks old.  When they did this restore characters that<br/>
&gt;were deleted 2-3 months ago were re-created.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>um, i have played regularly on test.  one of the quirks of their rollback is that<br/>
all previous characters that were deleted show back up on the account.  like<br/>
from forever.  when kunark beta characters got added into people&#39;s accounts<br/>
that created a problem.<br/>

&gt; &gt; i would agree.  since they are not, it hurts the players&#39; credibility, not<br/>
&gt;verant&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Uhh thanks so much for your ignorance of the situation..  We are players.<br/>
&gt;We pay $10 per month just like you.  The players who played there and got to<br/>
&gt;high levels SPECIFICALLY so that they could test high level<br/>
&gt;dungeons/areas/planes/dragons were basically paying verant for the<br/>
&gt;priveledge of doing their jobs for them.  People that played on test<br/>
&gt;religiously (I&#39;m not talking about the 5 day wonders that would level to<br/>
&gt;17th then go back to a live server) were very religious testers.  Most of us<br/>
&gt;have been testing this game since Beta 2 or earlier.  Many of those folks<br/>
&gt;have now left in disgust over their treatment by Verant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>doing a player wipe doesn&#39;t hurt the testing of areas.  gm&#39;s can always buff<br/>
up players to test new high level areas.  i know of quite a few people who played<br/>
on test simply because it was less crowded than other servers.  the population<br/>
on test went from 150ish to 600ish in a period of 3 months.  you think all those new<br/>
people came just to test stuff?  i never said that no one on test was testing stuff.<br/>
i said that the majority of people on test were not.  you make it sound like playing<br/>
on the test server was &#39;&#39;work&#39;&#39;.  you didn&#39;t derive any enjoyment out of being one <br/>
of the first people to see new zones/items/mobs?  you didn&#39;t derive any enjoyment<br/>
out of just playing the game?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;IMHO:  Anyone who played on Test should have been playing for free instead<br/>
&gt;of paying $10 bucks a month.  Just my opinion though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I leave you with this thought:<br/>
&gt;If there weren&#39;t level 50 players to test the planes, dragons, kunark,<br/>
&gt;etc... how stable would those zones be on the live servers?  Hope you enjoy<br/>
&gt;falling through the world for 32,000 dmg when walking across the plane of<br/>
&gt;hate.  I&#39;ve had it happen.  Have you? </span></blockquote></div>
