<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824362102"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There aren&#39;t any trainers because we didn&#39;t get any skills after 50 (till<br/>
53).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even so, now that Kunark is live, other classes have training facilities on<br/>
the new continent.  So maybe RoK Beta was tested by higher level PCs who<br/>
didn&#39;t need training, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that players are now<br/>
flocking there from all level ranges, and as such, want to visit a trainer<br/>
when they level.<br/>
<br/>
What about those Bards that have saved up practice points and just want to<br/>
increase a skill or learn the basics of a new language?  Unlike the majority<br/>
of other classes (I think there&#39;s one other class that doesn&#39;t have a<br/>
trainer, correct me if I&#39;m wrong), we have to travel to Kelethin or Freeport<br/>
for the privilege.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon&#39;s answer of (paraphrased) &quot;We don&#39;t want people to become totally<br/>
self-sufficient on the new continent&quot; screams of being a cop-out.  Other<br/>
classes are, why can&#39;t we?<br/>
