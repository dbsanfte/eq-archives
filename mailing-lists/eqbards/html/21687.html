<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141247365">If Verant think the EULA can relieve them of the burden of following Federal<br/>
law they are quite incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
No agreement, verbal or written, can cause an individual to abridge their<br/>
rights granted under the law except in cases of national security or to<br/>
protect the common good (commonly known as the &quot;Fire!&quot; clause.  Any such<br/>
agreement is null and void to the extent of which it abridges those rights.<br/>

Agreed on what you said about free speech.<br/>
<br/>
However, if the player did not violate any terms of the EULA, then there is<br/>
cause for concern.  Every player&#39;s account has a value of some sorts.  For<br/>
me, the value of my account is based on the amount of time I have put into<br/>
it developing my characters.  Because I have devoted massive amounts of my<br/>
personal time playing EQ, I have raised my character in levels, have the<br/>
ability to acquire items due to my level, can group with my friends who I<br/>
have made.  Because I have devoted so much time playing EQ, my account is<br/>
tremendously valuable to me.  This value has absolutely nothing to do with<br/>
the value of my account if I want to sell it to someone or selling items on<br/>
Ebay.  Its value is strictly personal.  The account of the person who wrote<br/>
the story is probably valuable to them in the same way.  If that person did<br/>
not violate the EULA, then Verant unlawfully took something away from them<br/>
that possessed a value of some sort without fair compensation.  I have no<br/>
idea what the legal implications of this are.  Will be interesting to see<br/>
how it plays out.<br/>

Actually, Free Speech says that the government cannot prevent you from<br/>
speaking.  It has nothing to do with private enterprise or personal<br/>
communications.<br/>
<br/>
It means that the law cannot be used to stop you from voicing your<br/>
opinions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a common misconception that Free Speech means that in America the law<br/>
says that you must be allowed to say anything in any place.<br/>

Hopefully someone has posted this to the FAC board.  They are a group that<br/>
actively fights First Amendment Abridgements pro bono.  I can&#39;t find the<br/>
link or I would post it myself.  Obviously Verant has never heard of Larry<br/>
Flynt or they probably would have taken a different course in this case.<br/>
