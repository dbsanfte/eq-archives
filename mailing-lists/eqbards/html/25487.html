<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564225456">Thanks for all the advice!  I started out in Frontier Mtns...more to just<br/>
get the rythym down with minimum risk.  Except for the goblin rockcrusher<br/>
(rock something...can&#39;t remember), that has a good range nuke on him...hehe.<br/>
From there, I tried in OT, with some pretty good success.  Then went on a<br/>
guild trip to CoM, after which, I went to GD, and tried a frost giant.<br/>
Hehe...what a miserable failure.  They *must* have a much higher MR than<br/>
most other mobs.  So, since I&#39;m there, I&#39;m nearby for faction raids to Kael,<br/>
and will just do the bears...hopefully, they don&#39;t resist as much.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the advice!  I haven&#39;t paid much attention to<br/>
Jonathans...then at advice given, I look...how in the hell did I overlook<br/>
that it&#39;s a 25% haste!?!?!  hehe...live and learn<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
Atonal<br/>

PS - I was in a guild group in CoM last night.  Me at 40, the next lowest<br/>
was 51, and the highest a 60, and my xp bar moved like it wasn&#39;t even in a<br/>
hell level.  I&#39;ll be pestering my guild to do those little raids like that<br/>
more often.  :)<br/>

do not kill frost giants, they have too many hps. go to OT and<br/>
chant-/fearkite chicken and pickles, they give good xp till 46 (got<br/>
powerlevelled through half 45 on a single evening there by a druid).<br/>
<br/>
beware the sabretooth tigers though, they can be mean!<br/>

Betreff: [eqbards] In a rut at 40<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;ve been 40 for about a month now, and have 2 bubbles to go.  I&#39;m sick<br/>
of being 40!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also sick of pickup groups!  Heh.  So, any advice would be welcome on<br/>
where to go at this level, and what song combination to use to solo me 2<br/>
bubbles as quickly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been using chains-fulfils-tuyens, but it takes so long to kill a frost<br/>
giant this way...I get bored quickly (hence, 40 for a month...hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
Atonal<br/>
