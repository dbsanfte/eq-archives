You will always be the center of attention as a bard.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was in Solusek&#39;s Eye (Sol A) at level 25 fighting some extremely<br/>
tough Fire and Inferno goblins.  These suckers make Runnyeye look like<br/>
Blackburrow.  Anyhow, I&#39;m standing with my group in the &quot;pull room&quot; which is<br/>
near a zone into Nagafen&#39;s Lair (Sol B) to which we can run for cover if<br/>
necessary.  There is another group pulling into this room as well.  My group<br/>
had finished off a few and our wiz and cleric were medding so I&#39;m just<br/>
standing there.  Not even playing a song.  Just standing there.  The other<br/>
group pulls two or three goblins in the room and one of them makes a beeline<br/>
straight for me and SMACK for 43,  SMACK for 22, SMACK, SMACK.  What the?  I&#39;m<br/>
not even on the aggro list of these guys.  So my group has to get up and help<br/>
me finish the damn thing off.<br/>
<br/>
One tip is that if you&#39;re fighting in a group where you&#39;re the (or one of the)<br/>
low level member of the group, don&#39;t play Area Effect (AE) songs at all, and<br/>
keep Hymn to a minimum.  Concentrate on playing as many buffing songs as you<br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Some observations that should be in the FAQ if they&#39;re not:<br/>
<br/>
1) Sitting is a taunt.  Green stuff will attack just about anyone if they&#39;re<br/>
sitting and/or meditating.  If I&#39;m really low on health and need to heal after<br/>
killing some nasty stuff and there&#39;s a lot of green stuff around (The yard in<br/>
Unrest comes to mind) I *will not* sit down to do it.  I&#39;ll crack out the<br/>
Mandolin and play Hymn standing.  If you sit down, the beetles and other<br/>
random yard trash will swarm ya.<br/>
<br/>
2) Every point of healing that you do to your party is percieved by mobs as<br/>
being damage to them (I&#39;d like to see some research done in this area by the<br/>
bard community).  So if you heal your group of six for 10 points each, you&#39;ve<br/>
done somthing like 60 points of damage to *each mob* that you&#39;re fighting.<br/>
Hymn is a good way to get every mob on you over the course of a few rounds,<br/>
especially if you&#39;re playing a stringed instrument.  For this reason I<br/>
normally don&#39;t start playing hymn at the very beginning of a battle.  Wait a<br/>
few rounds for the hate list of the mobs to be divided amongst you and the<br/>
other tanks in your group.  Once people are starting to drop health (maybe 12<br/>
or 15 rounds into a fight) I&#39;ll start playing hymn.  Don&#39;t listen to others<br/>
telling you to play it from the get-go, they&#39;ll get you killed.<br/>
<br/>
3) Area Effect (AE) songs are a big taunt.  This includes Direct Damage (DD)<br/>
songs, but also includes debuffs like Binding, Lullaby, Chains, etc.<br/>
<br/>
4) Crowd Control becomes increasingly important at higher levels. If you don&#39;t<br/>
have a competent enchanter in your group, that task will fall to you.  As you<br/>
gain levels it becomes increasingly difficult to pull only one or two mobs at<br/>
a time, and your ability to solo them drops dramatically.  If you pull too<br/>
many, your options are to zone, lullaby them, or pixie strike them and have<br/>
your group fight them one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps, and the bulk of it wasn&#39;t really directed at you<br/>
personally, but all younger bards.<br/>
