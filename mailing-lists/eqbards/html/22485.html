<div id="ygrps-yiv-176593818">I reported this bug about 3 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found out:<br/>
<br/>
System:<br/>
p3 650<br/>
512 mb ram<br/>
win 2k professional<br/>
20 gig udma hd @ 7200 rpm<br/>
prophet 3d ddr video card<br/>
ess 1868 sound card (oldest sound card on earth)<br/>
<br/>
Originally i found that occaisonally my shift key would appear to get stuck<br/>
and would stick other keys as well. Upon further investigation I linked this<br/>
to the numluck key being lit up.<br/>
<br/>
To replicate, make sure numlock is lit. Hit 6 on the numpad to turn right,<br/>
then hit shift, then lift up the 6 key before lifting up shift and watch<br/>
yourself spin ad infinitum.<br/>
<br/>
For months this was extremely annoying, but controlable through careful<br/>
monitoring of the numlock light. Then a few patches ago, things<br/>
deteriorated. Now, shift in conjunction with other keys has a chance to lock<br/>
that key. I&#39;ve seen my back space key locked, my shift key locked and<br/>
movement keys locked. Fortunately, the temporary fix is easy, just hit shift<br/>
again and it will unlock the key. In terms of a more permanent fix, I<br/>
suggest reverting to win 98 or win 95. I have been unable to replicate this<br/>
on either of those OSes and everyone I&#39;ve spoken with that has the bug is on<br/>
win 2k.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Sliding problems<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had big problems last night with my movement keys. I use a lot of &quot;slide <br/>
left&quot; and &quot;slide right&quot; movement in battle (old Doom/Quake habit). However, <br/>
I noticed now that when I press the &quot;shift&quot; key to slide, it locks me in <br/>
the same direction of movement (if I were turning then I start spinning).<br/>
<br/>
I sent a bug report in last night, and even submitted a petition. Was <br/>
surprised a guide contacted me (since I said that this was a low priority <br/>
in the grand scheme of things) and he told me to try to press my right <br/>
mouse button to slide. I tried this, even though I usually use my right <br/>
hand for the movement keys, but it didn&#39;t work. He didn&#39;t have any idea <br/>
what I could try to fix, since I mentioned I even tried remapping the <br/>
history commands to different keys.<br/>
<br/>
He suggested I wipe my opt files, but I just did that last week, so <br/>
everything is pretty clean. So I submitted a bug.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had similar problems and if so, anyone figure a way to fix<br/>
it?<br/>
