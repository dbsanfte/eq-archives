<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777356577">I agree, why bother, it&#39;ll just rot and get out of date and wind up giving<br/>
missinformation to young bards.  Tell em they can post a link to your site.<br/>
It&#39;s the best site I&#39;ve seen for song analysis.<br/>

&gt; The only problem I have with it is that Stratics hasn&#39;t kept up at all<br/>
&gt; on EQ, with a lot of their content and reference pages still unchanged<br/>
&gt; since beta. As long as their hosting wasn&#39;t exclusive I guess there&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; no downside but it wouldn&#39;t be very good to see the song list locked<br/>
&gt; away on a site that hardly anyone goes to due to it&#39;s mostly out of date<br/>
&gt; info.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Check their bard song list, hidden away under strategy and<br/>
&gt; statistics(tm)-&gt;class articles-&gt;bard spell list. They have 20 songs.<br/>
&gt; I guess it&#39;s nice that they are looking for a better list now but my<br/>
&gt; question would be; why, after over a year of total neglect, are they<br/>
&gt; bothering?<br/>
