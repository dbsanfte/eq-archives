&gt; &gt; Another interesting thing I haven&#39;t seen anyone comment on. Last<br/>
&gt; &gt; (emergency) patch they said they had to put in some changes half<br/>
&gt; &gt; finished when they put in the fixes for the network code, i.e. the necro<br/>
&gt; &gt; pet changes. Don&#39;t any of the programmers on the list find it odd that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t appear to have some kind of source control system that would<br/>
&gt; &gt; allow patching of the currently running code so they didn&#39;t have to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; live with partly finished changes?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re proposing they bring down the servers again to repatch.  <br/>
&gt; They may have decided that disruption was not worth the<br/>
&gt; benefit of temporarily removing a nerf to one of the strongest<br/>
&gt; classes in the game.  OTOH, when the bard proc bug showed up<br/>
&gt; again, they did an emergency patch two days later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you misunderstood. They brought the servers down to patch for some<br/>
crash bug last weekend. The patch note when they came back up said<br/>
they&#39;d also put in the partially completed necro changes as these were<br/>
part of the code base they&#39;d fixed the crash bug in.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Also, in large software projects, you tend to go with tested<br/>
&gt; executables rather than pieces.  The executable they tested<br/>
&gt; had the necro pet nerf in it.  Rolling back just that one<br/>
&gt; piece of code may have caused unanticipated and untested<br/>
&gt; problems in other sections of the code.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tested? I&#39;d be willing to bet the only part of that patch that was<br/>
tested was the part addressing the crash bug. Also, my experience with<br/>
large projects is usually that they use some sort of version control<br/>
system where merging in the fixes for one bug is easy to do by checking<br/>
out the last major revision. Patching the current code base, where there<br/>
are also many partial or untested changes is more a sign of no version<br/>
control system, IMO.<br/>
