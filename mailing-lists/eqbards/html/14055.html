<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402937796">I wanted to respond to this message as well..<br/>
<br/>
After having moved to my 3rd server now, I have finally found a home.  Unfortunatly, <br/>
between March and Today, I played 5 characters that I will likely never play again.  Learning <br/>
this game took alot of time for me, as I had limited time to play due to family and time <br/>
schedules varying.  Everytime I found a &quot;click&quot; they would out level me and move on  :(<br/>
<br/>
I finally settled down on my 2nd Bard, a Wood Elf and stuck with it.  There are definate <br/>
peaks and lulls in my life as a bard.  Ie.  Being lvl 23 for 2 weeks??  why??  dunno.  I actually <br/>
leveled through lvl 30 faster than I did lvl 23 even though I died 8 times at lvl 30  :(  Life is <br/>
tough at times.  Anyways, Lvls 27-30 took 2 days of about 5-7 days each.  Why? steady <br/>
blues and no deaths.  This seems to be the key in all things.  It seems that this game gets <br/>
easier with time, I certainly think so.  As you get higher, you play with more compentant <br/>
people.  Sure, you understand the game if you play to 20, but beyond that is where the <br/>
learning begins.  Certainly it will continue for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for rambling, I suppose what I want to say as well is that having a high level character <br/>
has nothing to do with having the Power Level Tendancies.  Often being in the right place at <br/>
the right time and meeting the right people will level you beyond your wildest dreams all the <br/>
while you are having a great time goofing off on the down times.<br/>

&gt;   I wanted to answer this, and quote things from the message<br/>
&gt;   but I haven&#39;t the energy.  I&#39;ll tell you this much:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I made level 50 after 9 months, Verant suggested it would take 12<br/>
&gt;   months to make level 50.  I guess I&#39;m smarter than the average <br/>
&gt;   bard.  But clumping me in the powergamers cliq is your own false<br/>
&gt;   take on this.  If you&#39;re looking for someone to blame, don&#39;t look<br/>
&gt;   this way.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;   All I can tell you right now is your tune will change.  Mine did.<br/>
