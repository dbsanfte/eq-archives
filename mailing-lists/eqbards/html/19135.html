<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900764469">My experiences have led me to the conclusion that Chain fear is only really<br/>
good if you have a partner.  1 bard alone cannot do enough dmg to kill large<br/>
mobs before they slaughter him/her.  And that&#39;s just from the occasional<br/>
string of resists.  I&#39;ve had mobs resist fear 3 times and then tripple swat<br/>
me for 100dmg each.  Just not fun.  The only time I chain/fear nowadays is<br/>
if I have a partner who can either heal or deal tremendous dmg or another<br/>
bard (RARE!)<br/>
<br/>
You truely are in a rather unique situation.  Most guilds don&#39;t have 4<br/>
bards, let alone 6, over 40 ;)  At least on my server that seems to be the<br/>
case.  My guild has almost 100 members and I&#39;m one of 3 bards over 40 (and I<br/>
just hit 41 this week)  The others are all low level secondaries (that will<br/>
most likely never see high levels).<br/>
<br/>
My routine when soloing is to either kite with FCC and TCF and Selos or to<br/>
charm kite.<br/>
<br/>
Never had very much luck with fear/chain solo<br/>

&gt; My guild has four bards over 40,  myself still plugging along at 36, and a<br/>
&gt; couple in their 20s.  Not certain if that is classified as an &quot;enormous&quot;<br/>
&gt; quantity but we do have more bards in the guild than any other class.  One<br/>
&gt; of the good things about having a lot of bards in your guild is that there<br/>
&gt; is a good chance there will always be at least two bards in your group.<br/>
&gt; Good example of what you can do with two bards occured last night in The<br/>
&gt; Overthere.  Me and another bard guildmate were partnered up and ripping<br/>
thru<br/>
&gt; everything in the zone.  He would sing chains and fear non stop and I<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; weave celerity, chant of battle and FCC.  If a mob got more than two or<br/>
&gt; three attacks on us the entire combat they got lucky.  Later on a rogue<br/>
saw<br/>
&gt; us and asked what we were doing.  We explained the chains/fear trick to<br/>
him.<br/>
&gt; He asked to join and all me and the other bard could see were visions of<br/>
&gt; massive backstabs in the immediate future.  After the rogue joined we were<br/>
&gt; shredding thru mobs like a cuisinart.  The only time we ever lost a<br/>
visible<br/>
&gt; portion on our health bar was if a 2d or 3d mob aggroed on us.  At no time<br/>
&gt; did we ever get into serious trouble.  All in all it was non-stop killing<br/>
&gt; with almost zero downtime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Funny thing is after he had been with us for a while, the rogue mentioned<br/>
&gt; that he had never seen any bard fighting in the style we had.  The rogue<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; a 50+ primary character so he had been playing EQ for a while.  I had<br/>
though<br/>
&gt; the chains/fear trick was a bard standard, especially in Kunark with the<br/>
&gt; small aggro radius of most mobs.  Does everyone else use this trick<br/>
whenever<br/>
&gt; the situation supports it (i.e. outdoors) or is it a largely non-used<br/>
trick?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m in Armigers of Mirth.  There is usually a group of Armigers hanging<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; at the windmill, the Hounted Tower, or the Sarnak castle most nights.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been in Frontier Mountains lately hacking away at big giants. ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, Galtin&#39;s guild Disciples of Honor has an enormous<br/>
number<br/>
&gt; of bards in it.  I think we have only three, me at 29 still, Rylos at 25,<br/>
&gt; and a very young bard<br/>
&gt; whose name escapes me right now.  We are working on organizing an alliance<br/>
&gt; with DoH to do those tougher things later on like Dragons etc.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m on E&#39;ci playing around in the Lake of Ill Omen also, which guild are<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; with?<br/>
