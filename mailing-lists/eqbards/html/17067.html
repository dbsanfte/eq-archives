<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217839874">Being the dumb bard, I pretty much skipped over &quot;the all instrument attack&quot;<br/>
in my younger days.  I dont really care for alot of button pushing and the<br/>
timing thing - when you add the instrument switching, the twitch factor over<br/>
whelms me.  But now that I have some decent level and the numbers per tick<br/>
are getting fairly significant:<br/>
<br/>
CoD: 32<br/>
DDD: 33<br/>
CoC: 50 (?)<br/>
Punch: 8<br/>
------------<br/>
total 123 dmg per tick (and those are level 48 numbers)<br/>
<br/>
I started using the technique on Ice Giants in front of Perma.  Also, 7<br/>
String Lute and Mc Vax horn ;p help.  Once we got to using the shaman<br/>
technique: root and DoT vs fear-chain, it was fun to watch them go down in<br/>
short order.  Song rang means being in melee with IG&#39;s but we had a cleric<br/>
and Lassie kept the IG distracted as well.<br/>

&gt; One night in Sol B I had a team member (a druid) ask me how long I could<br/>
&gt; keep doting for 120+ a tick and I told her, &quot;As long as I have HP&#39;s&quot; :)<br/>
