<div id="ygrps-yiv-454190647"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Now the ugly question.  What should I look for to help me identify a bad<br/>
&gt; group.  Not having gate, its helpful to make pretty quick judments on a<br/>
&gt; group since its hard to get out sometimes (in dungeons).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my experience, 95% of all bad groups are due to one or two individuals.<br/>
Bad apples can slowly rot the entire barrel, and cause the group to fall apart<br/>
rapidly.  If your group has one of these individuals, it&#39;s probably a good<br/>
idea to bail:<br/>
<br/>
THE LOOT HOUND -- &quot;Whoops!  I didn&#39;t mean to loot that.  Only 5sp, anyway<br/>
hehe.&quot;  Once is acceptable (I&#39;ve accidentally looted more times than I can<br/>
count trying to whip around with mouselook).  If it&#39;s a pattern, watch out!<br/>
<br/>
THE NINJA LOOTER -- Loot hound&#39;s deadly older brother.  Hard to spot who is<br/>
doing it, but if corpses are disappearing during battle, get out quick.  Not<br/>
only is this person stealing loot from the group, they are doing it instead of<br/>
helping fight.<br/>
<br/>
AFK -- Person goes afk and sits off in a corner for long periods of time,<br/>
gaining free xp while they get a snack.  Close cousin: BRB, who runs off to<br/>
sell and takes a enormous amount of time, but doesn&#39;t realise their spot in<br/>
the group, insisting they&#39;ll &quot;come right back!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SHOWOFF -- &quot;I&#39;ll just solo this mob, you all take the rest!&quot; 5 seconds later:<br/>
&quot;Ack!  Help!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THE MANABURNER -- If your party has just killed a lone low blue and somebody<br/>
gives the &quot;OOM&quot; message, hit that disband button.  Second cousin: the nuking<br/>
cleric.<br/>
<br/>
JOHNNY CAN&#39;T READ -- If you have to keep telling somebody something (&quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
attack mezzed mobs,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t try to pull a &#39;single&#39; from that train,&quot; etc),<br/>
they are never going to listen.<br/>
<br/>
DANCING CASTER -- They yell &quot;On me&quot; and start shuffling around the room,<br/>
making it impossible to get the mob off.<br/>
<br/>
THE SECOND PULLER -- If you hear more than one &quot;INC&quot; head immediately to the<br/>
zone, disband, and find another group.  Better than dying horribly.<br/>
<br/>
THE JIG JUNKIE -- Asks you to play Jig of Vigor to increase mana.  If they are<br/>
this stupid, they are going to be doing a lot of other stupid things.<br/>
<br/>
The other 5% of bad groups consist of all competant people, but the mix is<br/>
just wrong for the mob and/or area.  Nobody is doing anything wrong, and it&#39;s<br/>
hard to put your finger on where the foulup is.  Best way to spot a group like<br/>
this is if one person keeps dying with everybody else at full health.  That<br/>
should NEVER happen, even to a bard, in a good group.</div>
