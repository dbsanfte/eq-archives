<div id="ygrps-yiv-687945402">both sides are strong arguments, and both jeff and kitasi are definitely on<br/>
oppopsite sides of the spectrum, with a lot of us somewhere in between.  i<br/>
think kitasi&#39;s gripe is not that he is &quot;always grouped with enchanter,<br/>
cleric, AND snarer&quot; but that most players want to be or refuse to play<br/>
otherwise.  i haven&#39;t run into these problems because i am lucky not to<br/>
ever, ever, ever be in pick-up groups.<br/>
