<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438481415">Dorn is not a shadowknight, nor is Dvinn. Dorn appears to be a monk for all<br/>
intents and purposes, and Dvinn acts like a Rogue. I think a lot of the<br/>
higher level named NPC&#39;s dont conform to PC classes. For instance, I have<br/>
heard of NPC&#39;s who cast both Wizard and druid spells. But either way,<br/>
neither Dorn, nor Dvinn have EVER hit me with Harm touch, and NPC<br/>
shadowknights definitely do this<br/>

&gt;These are all, to my knowledge, Dark Elf Shadowknights.  Anyone who<br/>

&gt;with the rest... though it seems logical that they also have an alliance<br/>
&gt;with the DeathFist orcs and the Gnolls.... it seems to me they have an<br/>
&gt;unusally high presence in High Pass as well, which makes me wonder if they<br/>
&gt;are conspiring with the leader of High pass?  Things that make you go<br/>
