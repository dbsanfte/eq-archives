&gt; On Fennin Ro, there seems to be a rather nasty group of powergamers who<br/>
&gt; take great pleasure in killing Nostrolo whenever he spawns. The first<br/>
&gt; time I shouted for someone to help me find him I was greeted by the reply<br/>
&gt; &quot;Damn, now I have to hang around and kill him again.&quot; Nice... not.<br/>
&gt; Another time, I saw him standing near a small hexagonal shaped stone<br/>
&gt; plinth. Before I could complete the quest, some invisible mage nuked him,<br/>
&gt; and then laughed at me when I suggested that he could have waited until<br/>
&gt; *after* I spoke to him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh well, at the time I wasn&#39;t really ready to be wandering around SK. I<br/>
&gt; should make another attempt.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) I also just picked up &quot;Lisera&quot;, a lute that a bard in Qeynos needs<br/>
&gt; tuning. He says that I need to take it to someone named Nostrolo in the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Karanas&quot;. But, I looked and looked and could not FINFD This Nostrolo<br/>
&gt; person. Is this a broken quest, or have I just missed this fella? Could<br/>
&gt; someone give me an idea where to look for Nostrolo? Also, is Lisera a<br/>
&gt; lute<br/>
&gt; you should KEEP, meaning is IT better than a regular Lute?<br/>
