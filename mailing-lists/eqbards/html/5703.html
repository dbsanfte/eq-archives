<div id="ygrps-yiv-759668960">Hehe BB funny you should mention BB...<br/>
<br/>
I saw Harmonic use Lullaby in BB standing by the zone on the top floor.  He<br/>
pulled _every_ single gnoll (and a good many of the married ones too) up top<br/>
for a concert.  Too funny seeing 20 or 30 gnolls standing around peacefully<br/>
sleeping :-)  And Estella gave them a shock of earth quake and knocked em<br/>
flat!<br/>
<br/>
But in Blackburrow - where the mob density is high and they train a lot -<br/>
you don&#39;t want to lullaby unless you have the power to nod off everyone who<br/>
shows up.  Before I was 20 (17 or 18) I was helping someone in there and was<br/>
forced into using it.  I was facing 4 burlys around the water into land in<br/>
from the tree fall and could not go toe to toe with all 4 - so I used<br/>
lullaby to buy me some heal time and then bugged out.  Train to the zone!!<br/>
<br/>
In Paw - the gnoll AI seems to be a bit different.  I got killed in there at<br/>
a young age and did not really come back til I was over 20.  Then we ran<br/>
into some commanders who would run and I chased em. When they got out by the<br/>
herd of shamans, I thought - ruh roh, this is gonna be bad.  But the shamans<br/>
were too green to attack.  They just stood there and tried to heal the<br/>
commanders but never attacked us. I am sure they would have - if I had tried<br/>
lullaby.  Any one you nod will wake up agro on you - so unless its an<br/>
emergency and you are gonna do an immediate evac don&#39;t lullaby in high MD<br/>
areas.<br/>
<br/>
Beware the z-axis effect in muti-level dungeons too.<br/>
<br/>
Bandits and Raiders - my old nemesis.  I hate them.  If I get too many<br/>
bandits on me, I will lullaby and deal with the sleepy griz or whoever<br/>
passes by.  But I made the mistake of not getting deep enough into a raider<br/>
camp to effectively put all of the casters to sleep.  They burned me down in<br/>
short order - I think because I didn&#39;t get in close enough or their magic<br/>
resist was stronger than my magic song.  They were green to me but lots of<br/>
them.  Two of us died before the rest of our party could nuke them all.  In<br/>
my case it was just bad tactics from the get go.  <br/>
<br/>
I find it most useful in a face-to-face melee situation where you want some<br/>
crowd control.  I have used it at the bird ranch when one too many chickens<br/>
are pulled.  I&#39;ll take my chances on the passing lions, etc and try not to<br/>
be under the avo huts when I play it.<br/>
<br/>
I think its better in general to set up a lull (lament) and pull situation<br/>
where you try to maintain control of the fight.  Then if you get a bad pull<br/>
- at least you have the fite where you want it - away from the center of a<br/>
camp or spawn spot and can use lullaby for nodding the extra guest while you<br/>
deal with them one by one.<br/>

		Ok actually lots of places.  <br/>
		Place 1: Blackburrow, doesn&#39;t mean much anymore as I&#39;m not<br/>
there a lot since<br/>
		passing 15 but doing Lullaby around the Elite Guards would<br/>
draw every Burly<br/>
		gnoll and Gnoll out of the woodwork.<br/>
<br/>
		Place 2: Paw, same problem basicly, but I still hunt Nobles<br/>
and Commanders<br/>
		here as well as the named guys.  I dont want a bunch of<br/>
green guards jumping<br/>
		in while I am fighting the commanders or named Shamans.<br/>
<br/>
		Place 3: Kerra Isle, I draw the blue Clawknights and<br/>
Pridesman and<br/>
		Priestesses usually, lullaby here would also bring on hordes<br/>
of males,<br/>
		females, and huntresses.<br/>
<br/>
		Place 4: As you noted the outdoor zones, especially the<br/>
bandits in W Karana.<br/>
		I&#39;d love to use lullaby on the caster groups so we can sweep<br/>
a bandit camp<br/>
		and move on, but all it takes is a couple of who green<br/>
grizzlies and things<br/>
		get out of hand fast.  <br/>
<br/>
		Place 5: I can&#39;t imagine the nightmare this would cause in<br/>
Crushbone as<br/>
		every green Centurion in range started stunning me.<br/>
<br/>
		Anyways, these are the situations that come to mind most.<br/>
