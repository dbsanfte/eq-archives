&gt;I am looking for a real list that describes the actual effects of the<br/>
&gt;bard songs.  I am tired of +attack spd, +AC, dmg etc.  Chant of Battle<br/>
&gt;and Anthem de Arms are almost indestinguishable in effect as far as I<br/>
&gt;can tell and with no detailed description I have no clue when one is<br/>
&gt;better to use then the other.  Chord of Dissonance gives me no<br/>
&gt;indication of much much dmg I do and if I choose not to juggle then I<br/>
&gt;give up STR and AC to use it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll let Jyzan or Mr. Kim or someone point you in the right direction as I <br/>
don&#39;t have any of the more descriptive lists linked from work (Jyzan, didn&#39;t <br/>
you update the eqvault list to be more detailed or something?)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Basically I am trying to decide what the right song or combination of<br/>
&gt;songs to use are based on the situation and verant (I hate them) gives<br/>
&gt;us no idea what the songs actually do.  As most of our songs work on<br/>
&gt;the group as a whole it is nearly impossible to determine whether I am<br/>
&gt;helping or my teammates or if they just happen to be making good die<br/>
&gt;rolls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Currently I have just taken to juggling between anthem, chant, and CoD<br/>
&gt;while wading into battle.  Just made 12th but have not purchased many<br/>
&gt;songs above 7th lvl.  Asside from healing (with mandolin) during or<br/>
&gt;after battle my groups have not been overly enthused about the bard<br/>
&gt;class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, here&#39;s a problem - Anthem and Chant don&#39;t twist (last I checked), so <br/>
it&#39;s pointless. Anthem is better than Chant, that&#39;s why it&#39;s higher level.  <br/>
Just take Chant out of your rotation. CoD is not a very good song to juggle <br/>
because it&#39;s a damage per pulse song, even though you see the icon the <br/>
effect is not enough that you should spend too much time twisting it with <br/>
other songs. Usually if I use it at all I will break out the mandolin and <br/>
play it non-stop.<br/>
<br/>
The base songs you should twist at your level is at least Whistling Warsong <br/>
(to give yourself a boost), and Anthem de Arms (to give your party a boost). <br/>
Anthem really is a beneficial song as it slihtly speeds up attacks as well <br/>
as attack rolls for everyone. Every little bit counts. As far as a 3rd song <br/>
if you care to throw one in, I sometimes threw in a Boastfull Bellow for a <br/>
little extra dmg (level 12 song, if you don&#39;t have it GET IT). As soon as <br/>
the damage hits I end it and start the rotation again. At your level those <br/>
are the 3 I would consider rotating during combat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am happy with the class have intrument and song juggling down pat be<br/>
&gt;have no clue as to when to sing and wade in or stand back and play?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I figure if I am in a party who needs my extra sword when fighting a <br/>
particular mob (or group of mobs) they will usually need my sword to help <br/>
win the fight. Especially with groups of blue critters, or the single `even&#39; <br/>
to `tombstone&#39; crit. This is almost always the case since your party <br/>
benefits the most from these fights. If we happen upon  a critter that the <br/>
party can easily take out without me i MIGHT stand back and sing a party <br/>
supporting song with instrument in hand. These times are rare, but sometimes <br/>
the break is nice =)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;One last note is it true that song 11 and 14 do not work.  If so that<br/>
&gt;really blows.  We only get 1 song a level (most of which are truely<br/>
&gt;useless I only use 4 songs now and I am 12th level for cripes sake and<br/>
&gt;now I get double screwed at 11 and 14th?!?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, not sure about song 11 as I never used it (never had any faction <br/>
problems except for with some spell merchants, but that doesn&#39;t matter to <br/>
most non-mages). However I KNOW song 14 doesn&#39;t work (the Catalogueing <br/>
Libretto) because the song is basically the same thing as an Identify spell <br/>
(which also doesn&#39;t work). The reason identify magic doesn&#39;t work is because <br/>
all magic items in the game are already identified. Nothing is hidden. I <br/>
personally hope that if they don&#39;t ever plan on hiding any magical <br/>
properties on items that they either provide us with some lore on items <br/>
using this song (a minor consolation to some, major to others as we are <br/>
supposed to be lore masters), OR they replace the song with something <br/>
useful.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I jumped my lazy arse over to Jyzan&#39;s song list and songs up to level <br/>
20 are described in DETAIL with no plain old stat listings. J did a good job <br/>
actually.<br/>
