<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Instrument vs. melee attacks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-877906786">At lvl 21, my all instrument attack was much better than my weapon<br/>
attack, but that may change if you have bette weapons.  I only have a<br/>
fine steel spear and a dwarven mace.<br/>
<br/>
For the all instrument I used Denon&#39;s + Chords + Hymm.<br/>
<br/>
I never logged and did the math, but I couldn&#39;t solo anything  high blue<br/>
with the weapons and I was soling blakc and yellows using the<br/>
intstruments.  <br/>
