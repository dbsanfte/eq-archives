<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301447240">It seems that the spawns in zones vary by the population in<br/>
them. Mobs have a range of difficulty to them and if the<br/>
zone population increases and the average level of the<br/>
characters in the zone goes up, the more difficult versions<br/>
of the mobs tend to spawn. For example, earlier this week<br/>
I was in Misty Thicket on Brell at an ungodly hour and<br/>
there were only 6 people in the zone counting myself. Almost<br/>
all of the giant wasps that spawned in the 3 hours I was there<br/>
were blue or white to me with a rare yellow. (I was level 8)<br/>
The next afternoon, the zone had 40 plus people in it and<br/>
there were quite a few level 11 plus people farming Mooto<br/>
and the goblin/orc camp. During the 2 hours I was there,<br/>
I saw a couple of white wasps and all of the others were<br/>
yellow. Furthermore, I saw several multi-wasp spawns and<br/>
they were all yellow as well so this was not the result of<br/>
people killing only the blue wasps!<br/>

This may seem like superstition on my part but the goblin wizards in<br/>
Butcherblock seemed to have been given a boost in their nastiness. I was<br/>
soloing these guys at lvl 12 without losing more than two bubbles of damage,<br/>
then recently at level 13 I hit a few once more and almost died a few times.<br/>
I know that things that con the same can vary in potency but this is a big<br/>
difference. I&#39;ve also noticed this with the skeletons outside of the<br/>
Minotaur Cave in Steamfront, which helped me make my 12th level and turned<br/>
promptly to conning green, only to return to blue now at 14th level.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else see similar things like this happening?<br/>
