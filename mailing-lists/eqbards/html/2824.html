<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464191577"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No, all you have to claim is that you&#39;re trying to attack the<br/>
&gt; monsters there, and the bigger guys keep taking it every time.<br/>
&gt; In this case, their misguided harassment definition (only<br/>
&gt; harassment if it&#39;s aimed at an individual) works in your<br/>
&gt; favor since they are literally killing everything you attack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t qualify as harassment unless you leave and go<br/>
elsewhere and they follow you. Ask a GM about it sometime, or read the<br/>
guide handbook. Kill stealing everything at a location isn&#39;t harassment.<br/>
Following you wherever you go and kill stealing is.<br/>
