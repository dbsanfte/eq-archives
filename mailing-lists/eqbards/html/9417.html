I hate to see a solid contributor leave, but if you must, you must.  22nd<br/>
was bad for me too.  I&#39;m having a blast at 28th.  I&#39;m not gaining any levels<br/>
right now because I&#39;m accumulating my Lambent items, but the questing is<br/>
really fun to me.<br/>
<br/>
UNREST TIP:<br/>
You jumped the railing coming out of the side door of Unrest, didn&#39;t you?<br/>
There is a not-very-well-known pathing issue here.  If you go in through the<br/>
side door and pull something, do not jump the railing when you come out to<br/>
your group.  If you do so, the mobs get confused and then go back in through<br/>
the round room and out through the back door.  This has the effect of<br/>
pulling everthing from the rear of the house.  Instead, when you come out<br/>
the door, take the time to turn to the right or the left and go down the two<br/>
or three steps to the yard.  If you do that, the mobs will follow you.  Some<br/>
Dark Elf told me that one time and I was skeptical but tried it out.  IT<br/>
DEFINITELY WORKS.<br/>

&gt; &gt;So does that mean you&#39;ve quit playing EQ or you have retired from your RL<br/>
&gt; &gt;job?  Not good if its #1, congrats if its #2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, the first.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but after spending the<br/>
&gt; last 2 weeks<br/>
&gt; gaining a half a bubble slowly over several hours, only to lose it in an<br/>
&gt; instant at LEAST 6 times a day - I just got too frustrated.  I was trying<br/>
&gt; to play by Brad&#39;s rules: group or die, so I was grouping,<br/>
&gt; everywhere.  Died<br/>
&gt; 3 times in a row in Unrest, and the only support I got from my group was<br/>
&gt; &quot;Dude, you&#39;re too low - you&#39;re gonna die if you come back!&quot; (I was 22nd.)<br/>
&gt; I gave up on groups and decided to solo, but the very first pull, a simple<br/>
&gt; Dark Boned Skeleton standing RIGHT at the side door, went awry, when the<br/>
&gt; skeleton somehow decided that the door was not the shortest path to e, and<br/>
&gt; ran through the entire house to get to me, of course, bringing the entire<br/>
&gt; house with it.  I just /quit&#39;d, didn&#39;t even look back.  I can&#39;t play the<br/>
&gt; game if I can&#39;t find a regular group, and every group I find that is<br/>
&gt; halfway decent soon outstrips me in levels, so I gave up.<br/>
&gt;   Enjoy it, and perhaps someday I&#39;ll be back, but for now, I will be<br/>
&gt; leaving for greener pastures.  At least, single-player-friendly pastures.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. I wasn&#39;t the only one to make this decision in my semi-regular group.<br/>
&gt; After dying 3 times in a row to trains other groups brought over<br/>
&gt; her in the<br/>
&gt; space of 30 minutes, with NO opportunity to gain experience before dying<br/>
&gt; again... well... she decided to quit, too.  One less Druid on Bristlebane,<br/>
