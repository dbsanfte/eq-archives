<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441711817">How long are your fights?  Over a 45 second fight I<br/>
will almost guarantee that you are not AVERAGING more<br/>
than 2 procs a fight.  Probably, right around 1.5<br/>
procs.  Run your logs through a parser and I&#39;ll bet<br/>
you will be shocked.  I&#39;m not saying that you can&#39;t<br/>
regularly proc 3 or 4 times in a fight.  However, it<br/>
will be averaged with those times where you don&#39;t proc<br/>
at all in a fight.  <br/>
<br/>
I used a Staff of Writhing and Obsidian Shard to test<br/>
and had my dex bumped to 159--part of the time I even<br/>
had it around 173.  Guess what.  We fought lancerfish<br/>
in kedge.  The fights lasted 45-60 seconds.  I<br/>
AVERAGED less than 2 procs a fight.  Granted I charmed<br/>
in a couple of fights.  However, I proced nowhere near<br/>
the 4 or 5 times a fight that I felt like I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not saying that you aren&#39;t sometimes<br/>
getting 3 or 4 procs a fight.  I get 3 to 4 procs a<br/>
fight fairly often myself.  All I am saying is that<br/>
you are probably not AVERAGING 3 to 4 a fight.  Run<br/>
your log through EQParse and I&#39;ll bet you are<br/>
surprised.<br/>

&gt; Umm I hate to break this to you, Thex, but I use two<br/>
&gt; proc&#39;ing weapons and<br/>
&gt; they _routinely_ fire off 3-4 times a fight and<br/>
&gt; sometimes several more.  I<br/>
&gt; had one fight where my ugly stick proc&#39;d 7 times in<br/>
&gt; a row (esp primary hand)<br/>
&gt; Then again my un-buffed dex is 150.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Who needs AC anyway?  I&#39;m not a tank!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Who cares about the proc?  Most weapons don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; average<br/>
&gt; &gt; more than 1 proc every 45 seconds or so anyway<br/>
&gt; &gt; (contrary to most people&#39;s belief that they<br/>
&gt; average 4<br/>
&gt; &gt; or 5 procs per fight).  The damage/delay is better<br/>
&gt; &gt; than the ykesha and ebw (not taking into account<br/>
&gt; magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; numbers and lower delay,etc).  I guess I still<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; see why you guys think it is crappy.  Granted it<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; off a dragon and is only marginally better than<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; ykesh or ebw.  However, unless you have a planar<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon I would consider this better.  Anyway,<br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; on Tunare who think this weapon is crappy--I will<br/>
&gt; &gt; gladly take your crappy weapon!<br/>
