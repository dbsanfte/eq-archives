&gt; <br/>
&gt; Want to wish all you veterans out there a good Veterans Day <br/>
&gt; weekend.  I for one<br/>
&gt; am looking forward to the break.  Since I&#39;m in the US Army, <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m off through<br/>
&gt; Monday.  Combine that with my wife having to work(evil grin) <br/>
&gt; and that means I<br/>
&gt; get to play EQ all day tomorrow and Friday.  This will be the <br/>
&gt; first time in a<br/>
&gt; long time I get to play for more than two hours at a time.  <br/>
&gt; Just might get the<br/>
&gt; chance to finally make 27th level and play around with the <br/>
&gt; Charm song some.<br/>
&gt; Already printed out the song analysis that John Kim posted a <br/>
&gt; few weeks back so I<br/>
&gt; have it to refer to.  Got my song scroll already in my <br/>
&gt; backpack and I&#39;m even<br/>
&gt; gonna go ahead and make my pet hotkeys now in anticipation of <br/>
&gt; gaining that song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For you E&#39;ci bards (Kitasi, Faras, Aloro, Laluni, et.al.), <br/>
&gt; look me up if you are<br/>
&gt; online.  Maybe we can all get together and work on getting <br/>
&gt; quest components for<br/>
&gt; our armor.  I&#39;m getting tired of MM and was thinking about <br/>
&gt; heading to Solusek.<br/>
&gt; An enchanter friend who is 35th level has already agreed to <br/>
&gt; help me fight giants<br/>
&gt; in order to get some lambent stones as well.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care<br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
