&gt;Ok, I&#39;m going to have to ask for even more spoiler. :)  I&#39;ve been to<br/>
&gt;Kithicor a couple of times, and besides some ruins (stonehenge kind) having<br/>
&gt;some rather easy (for a lvl 14 druid, and lvl 14 cleric) mummies and green<br/>
&gt;skels, and occasional green skels that pop up around the lake, we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;been able to find any more critters worth beating up on.  A few blue spiders<br/>
&gt;or snakes (can&#39;t remember exactly), few & far between.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what good IS Kithicor?  I&#39;m not being a smartass or sarcastic, I&#39;d really<br/>
&gt;like to know.  Please give me some ideas WHERE is good in there.<br/>
<br/>

and just past the lake and close to the Highpass entrance, I saw a <br/>
unique,named orc that conned white to my level 15 Bard. Anyone know who <br/>
this was? I wish I could remember name but it eludes me.<br/>
