<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392996516">all my time there was spent at level 50 going after wakazishis (except for<br/>
the 3 trips, 3 deaths between 30 to 40 which made me avoid the place), and i<br/>
was with a level 50 druid so i did not solo.  just for the sake of argument<br/>
though... could you not invis the entire way to the butler&#39;s room?  and once<br/>
there, charm the gargoyle in the room to attack the butler, then finish off<br/>
the winner?  i suppose the surrounding rooms and hall spawns would come<br/>
running, but just a thought.<br/>

&gt; I did not want to imply that a lvl 32 Bard could solo the <br/>
&gt; butler if that is<br/>
&gt; what i did.  Obviously, we are just not equipped to even GET <br/>
&gt; there, let alone<br/>
&gt; solo a named mob (caster, no less) that is only 2 lvls below <br/>
&gt; us.  But, you<br/>
&gt; could probably bribe a druid to get it for you. : ) </span></blockquote></div>
