 </span></blockquote>	Harmonic, your concern gets brought up alot, and I hope I can<br/>
answer this to your satisfaction.  LoD is self sufficient, we can<br/>
basically do the dragons or planes without outside assistance.  In fact,<br/>
we often have to leave our own guildmates behind.  I have often been asked<br/>
why we don&#39;t invite another guild along to share in the experience of<br/>
killing a dragon.  The answer is simple, to do so would mean leaving<br/>
even more guildmates who would like to kill a dragon behind.  I&#39;m sorry,<br/>
but I put my guildmates first, and if they want to go, they get<br/>
precedence over people outside of the guild.<br/>
<br/>
	To many, such practices seem &quot;elitist&quot;.  I can definitely<br/>
understand why someone would think that, some of my guildmates do act with<br/>
that kind of attitude.  But there IS a logical reason for not inviting<br/>
outside people, in addition to the fact that inter-guild co-ordination is<br/>
alot of work.<br/>
<br/>
	Bards, well, we invited Tokisada to most of our raids, and<br/>
Weadaneye to almost all of them.  We had room for bards, and we happy<br/>
invited bards from other guilds to come and help.  Weadaneye has Evensong<br/>
and a Six Note Blade now, and both have Selo&#39;s Drum/Orbs, so it&#39;s no<br/>
secret we appreciate their time and effort.<br/>
