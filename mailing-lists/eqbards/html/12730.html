500 pp or so. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s cheaper on the older servers. This guy had a<br/>
pretty nice deal going.<br/>

the US? The popular gameshow &quot;Greed&quot; has the host asking contestents, &quot;Do<br/>
you feel the need for greed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess this guy was saying, &quot;Yes!&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I believe it comes from the same Froglok Squire (thats not <br/>
&gt; his name) in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Upper Guk I asked about...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Now that&#39;s funny.  They should put that on the EQ Guide Application.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Which mob drops the runed bone fork?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   a) scryer<br/>
&gt;   b) squire<br/>
&gt;   c) scribe<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can I use a lifeline?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s, b) squire. Yes, Regis, that&#39;s my final answer. :-)<br/>

P.S.<br/>
My wife loves these shows, I can&#39;t avoid them. I prefer &quot;Win Ben Stein&#39;s<br/>
Money&quot; myself. Have we gotten far enough off topic on this? Sorry Squire!</div>
