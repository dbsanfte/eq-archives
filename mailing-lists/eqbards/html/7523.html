<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432523493"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Shamans are Hybrids, though... they get bind....<br/>
&gt; Come to think of it, so are Clerics...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it in the &quot;Norrath&quot; frame of mind. What is<br/>
the difference between a high elf cleric and a high<br/>
elf paladin for example other than profession? Why<br/>
can&#39;t one high elf be &#39;magically bound&#39; the same<br/>
way as another can? It would be one thing if the<br/>
Gods of Norrath deemed that warriors are too crude<br/>
or something to be affected by such magic - but the<br/>
fact that they *can* be affected by the magic in<br/>
one place makes no sense to me that it won&#39;t<br/>
affect them the same way anywhere else. (Except maybe<br/>
one of the plane&#39;s since magic is supposed to work<br/>
differently there)<br/>
<br/>
Class balance? Please. What&#39;s balanced about making a<br/>
naked non-casting class run through 6 zones to return<br/>
to his party (hoping he doesn&#39;t die along the way)<br/>
when a caster can memorize his spells, shield himself<br/>
with said spells/buffs and then run back from their<br/>
close by bind point nearly as armed and protected as<br/>
just before he died?<br/>
<br/>
If anything, it would benefit classes that can cast<br/>
bind because now they&#39;ll be able to make money while<br/>
they&#39;re adventuring instead of having to sit in a<br/>
city casting binds. &quot;Oh, you need a bind here by the<br/>
Guk zone? Sure! Donation please!&quot; Instead of, &quot;Sorry<br/>
I can&#39;t do that in a non-city zone. Look me up next<br/>
time I&#39;m in Freeport.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Want an example? Think of how it would be if SOW could<br/>
only be cast on non-SOW casters in cities.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no need to change the way bind works (ie: more<br/>
mana, only once per game day, need item, etc). Just<br/>
remove the limitation that prevents everyone from<br/>
getting bound.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a Bard only issue. This is a non-caster<br/>
and hybrid issue.</div>
