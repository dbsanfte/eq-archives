<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;up. We were fear kiting by there and the mobs just ran in to the wall. Kept <br/>
&gt;fear<br/>
&gt;up and killed them. Should I bug that or leave it to bad pathing? Reason I ask<br/>
&gt;is I don&#39;t want to get in trouble for a bug exploit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can someone send me there downtime macro for weaving Mana and healing? I <br/>
&gt;think I<br/>
&gt;need to set those up so I can spare my hands.<br/>
