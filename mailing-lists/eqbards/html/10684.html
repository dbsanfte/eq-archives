<div id="ygrps-yiv-404980573"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Heh heh, I forgot about that Harmonic, our charm only works for 8<br/>
&gt; levels cause you can&#39;t charm anything over 35th level right?  Remind <br/>
&gt; me not to get used to that song in a couple months.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I think I pulled charm off on a level 37 greater kobold, but<br/>
  level 38 gave me a no-no message.  Charm still works great on<br/>
  hill giants and griffons, if ya need a quick lambent stone =)<br/>
<br/>
  I used to charm back my own group members in CT Tae room, when <br/>
  they were charmed, and control them myself, that was a laugh.<br/>
  I tried it recently on the kobold noble, and players higher <br/>
  than level 37 gave me that same bogus message, oh well.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
