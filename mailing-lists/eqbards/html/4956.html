&gt; Not one where you could USE a weapon and<br/>

&gt; that we didn&#39;t have to&gt; physically equip<br/>
&gt; and unequip constantly - just trade off in<br/>
&gt; some type of button arrangement - like archers<br/>
&gt; do between their bow and other weapons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I&#39;ve always wished for, and don&#39;t believe would take away from the &quot;We<br/>
want you to actually be doing something during a battle&quot; belief&#39;s that I<br/>
think Verant has is..<br/>
<br/>
Configurable Item Setups<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain briefly.. Currently we have 6 hot-key banks that we can setup<br/>
with things that we want to be able to do with a single push of a button.<br/>
Why can&#39;t we add 6 more banks for three different &quot;weapon setups&quot; that we<br/>
use? Let&#39;s say I setup my hot-configurations like so:<br/>
<br/>
M1=Meelee1, M2=Meelee2,<br/>
R=RangedWeaponSlot,<br/>
I1=InvSlot1, I2=InvSlot2, I3=InvSlot3<br/>
<br/>
1 - M1=CombineLS, M2=DragoonDirk, R=Empty, I1=Lute, I2=Drum<br/>
2 - M1=CLS, M2=Shield, R=DD, I1=Lute, I2=Drum<br/>
3 - M1=Empty, M2=Drum, R=DD, I1=CLS, I2=Shield, I3=Lute<br/>
4 - M1=Empty, M2=Lute, R=DD, I1=CLS, I2=Shield, I3=Drum<br/>
<br/>
Then we could take the buttons for the 6 banks,and make them hot-keys in one<br/>
of our 6 hot-key banks. So I press 1 to load up my dual-wield, press 3 to<br/>
load up my drum config, and 4 to load up my lute config, etc.. A delay could<br/>
be put in (say 1 attack round) so that it&#39;s not an instantaneous swap (which<br/>
would be nice, but unfair).<br/>
<br/>
I for one don&#39;t see the realism of having to manually make these changes.<br/>
They&#39;re annoying at best having to click around so much, and at worst<br/>
they&#39;re dangerous because you lose weapons/instruments/etc if you mis-click.<br/>
It&#39;s also something that&#39;s not useful for only a Bard. This is something<br/>
that EVERY class in EQ could make use of. (Except perhaps the Monks since<br/>
they have no weapons to swap around)<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think? I realize this likely isn&#39;t going to happen due to<br/>
the amount of coding that would be required, but it&#39;s definitely on my wish<br/>
list.</div>
