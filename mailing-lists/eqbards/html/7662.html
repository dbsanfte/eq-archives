&gt;i understand your position, i just don&#39;t know how many people it applies to.<br/>
&gt;i actually am enjoying this discussion, i like debating intelligently,<br/>
&gt;without getting TOO offensive =)  and damn it really got this list going, i<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t even been able to read the other posts like the bard letter to GZ<br/>
&gt;Part Three.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is precisely why I didn&#39;t &quot;Kabong!&quot; it.  It seems to be of immense<br/>
interest to the list, and no one seemed overly inflammatory (well, there<br/>
was one, but it was easily handled).<br/>
<br/>
You guys really make some of the best arguments I&#39;ve seen. =) Bards rule -<br/>
