It&#39;s not an item flag!  It&#39;s an option in the client to just not allow you<br/>
to drop items.  It could be a no drop/trade switch for all I care so you<br/>
just can&#39;t click it in an empty area.   It has _nothing_ to do with your<br/>
equipment other than not letting you dump it on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
And to those who think it&#39;s a difficult code change:<br/>
<br/>
The client already checks to see if you are dropping the item or if you are<br/>
giving it to someone.  All they&#39;d need to do is add a flag:<br/>
<br/>
If Drop and playerwantsdrops=yes then item drops<br/>
Else item stays<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really rudimentary pseudo code but it would be VERY easy to stick<br/>
into the client code.  It&#39;s not even a server side check.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; items flagged as no drop (currently with the NO DROP text in their<br/>
description)<br/>
&gt; cannot be looted by others when they pvp kill you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; yes i agree, i don&#39;t see why this is such a difficult concept to grasp.<br/>
oh, i guess<br/>
&gt; unless you have never participated in a pvp server and thus don&#39;t know how<br/>
it works.<br/>
