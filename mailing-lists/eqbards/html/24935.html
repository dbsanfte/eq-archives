<b>Subject:</b> *HOAX* Virus Warning - DO NOT PASS ON! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571302121">There is currently a hoax running around that the file named SULFNBK.EXE is <br/>
a virus, and should be deleted before it &quot;activates&quot; on June 1st.  It is <br/>
not a virus.  In fact, it is a Microsoft Windows utility that is used to <br/>
restore long file names - which means that deleting it could cause you more <br/>
problems than it solves.<br/>
<br/>
If you receive this email, the appropriate thing to do is to delete it.<br/>
<br/>
For more information on this hoax, go to <br/>

<br/>
And, as always, keep a good, up-to-date virus scanner active on your <br/>
computer, and never open any attachments from someone you don&#39;t know or <br/>
don&#39;t trust.  Especially don&#39;t open anything you&#39;re not expecting.<br/>
