<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078062058">Well, having recently made 15 (and now 16 and 17 - all in 2 weekends) I got<br/>
excited about the Lullby - as someone had been telling me - was it you<br/>
Harmonic?  <br/>
<br/>
Anyways - I tried it out and had some good success with it.  But my<br/>
enchanter friend keeps telling me she will be the crowd control expert and<br/>
my sleepy song is not reliable (she heard that the mobs have a chance to<br/>
resist it - and to her that means break out and attack).  So there we were<br/>
running the river from East Karanas on our way to South Karanas and as we<br/>
pass the raider camp (all green and a couple blue cons), I go can we try out<br/>
my sleepy song.  So, eveyone - me 16, enchanter 18, ranger 17, & druid 18<br/>
agree to give it a go.<br/>
<br/>
On my way running back from Highhold with the ranger who used to be my<br/>
friend but now wont even talk to me, I had a chance to asses what went<br/>
wrong....<br/>
<br/>
First off, - them green and blues - were lots of them.  And bunches of them<br/>
were casters.  So to answer your question - what is worst is a swarm of<br/>
green casters!<br/>
<br/>
Second - I fired up the song and played my lute but the mistake was running<br/>
down to them to start the attack.  I should have attacked the edges and<br/>
pulled on one - then if the whole camp jumped me at least they would be<br/>
close and under the spell.  As it was - I attacked then got them mad and<br/>
casting without getting close enough to put them all to sleep.  Only a<br/>
couple came over to fight - the rest just stood off and casted on us and<br/>
buffed their buddies.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I died and the ranger died but the enchanter and druid survived and<br/>
finished off the rest of the raiders. Grrrr,  now I have to go back and get<br/>
some revenge.<br/>
<br/>
Later on I did get to show my enchanter friend how it really does work.  We<br/>
were down in SK working on aviaks and got an unexpected double or triple<br/>
pull.  This time I did manage to hold them quite well and the party was<br/>
smart enough to fight only one at a time.  So I think I was able to build<br/>
some respect for the Lucid Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
There are some major differences between how an enchanter can do it and how<br/>
and when we use it.  The enchanter can target and mez just one - ours is AE<br/>
and you need to be aware of the ramifications of that.  Also, the enchanter<br/>
can mez then memblur.  We do this a lot when a pesky green joins a melee.<br/>
Mez it and kill off the big mob. Then blur it and walk away.  It goes on its<br/>
merry totally forgotten how much it hated us.  If we put something to sleep<br/>
- we go to number one on their hate parade when they wake up.  That can be<br/>
used to your advantage though.<br/>
<br/>
If the mob decides to lock on to your caster, and you can&#39;t taunt it off<br/>
with attack or bellow, you can try the lucid lullaby.  If you can make it<br/>
nod - it forgets about that nasty old caster and turns back on you - it<br/>
helps if the caster will stop stabbin it while you nod it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really like to hear some more tips about using this and other bard<br/>
fighting skills.<br/>

		Second question: What do you fear more: a blue spellcaster,<br/>
a white/black<br/>
		grunt, or a train of greens?  How do you handle each?</div>
