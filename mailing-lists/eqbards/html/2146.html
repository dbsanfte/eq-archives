&gt; medium bronze armor comes from greater kobolds in solusek B (nagafen&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lair).  they are level 35+.<br/>
<br/>

at the point their character would survive in Sol B.<br/>

Medium bronze is much easier to obtain in Permafrost now. It was dropped<br/>
by elite ice goblin guards for one. They still conned blue to me when I<br/>
was there at L40, thought very little else did.  They aren&#39;t as hard as<br/>
the greater kobolds, but still way harder than the ice bones in Unrest<br/>
that have been dropping bronze for small races since L22 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Appearantly Dresla in Najena used to also drop the occasional piece of<br/>
bronze plate as well, as I know someone that found it on her, but in the<br/>
three days I spent there I saw her drop two pairs of Journeyman boots<br/>
and an Ashenwood spear but no medium bronze.<br/>
<br/>
I used to wonder why small bronze plate was so easy to obtain at lower<br/>
levels. It seems like that dungeon was designed by Monty Haul compared<br/>
to anywhere else playable by people in that level range. Now, however, I<br/>
spend my time wondering why the lovely Black plate chest we found has a<br/>
class list of every plate wearer but the bard, an why the bard was<br/>
removed as a class who could use the cerrated bone dirk. Oh well, at<br/>
least I got a nice face mask that lets me look like a dark elf, though<br/>
the effect wears off when you zone so it&#39;s not really all that useful<br/>
for visiting a dark city or anything.<br/>
