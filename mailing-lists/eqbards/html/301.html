<div id="ygrps-yiv-272448908">Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carrillion sounds like such a good song, it is <br/>
really a bummer that it appears to have no/little effect. IMO it is <br/>
broken and also IMO should be one of our defining songs.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to see from the song is the ability to go to places <br/>
Bards are not normally able to go, such as the Troll/Orge cities. It <br/>
is our function after all to document the history of Norrath,record  <br/>
the stories of all races, and to bring a song to many different faces.<br/>
<br/>
I will feedback this tonight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody else found level 11 to be a bit of a wall? I am finding it <br/>
hard going.<br/>
