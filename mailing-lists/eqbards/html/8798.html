king room.  After you zone into Sol A, pass the lava and go<br/>
through the hole in the wall, you&#39;ll come to a T intersection<br/>
at the ledge.  If you go straight (off the ledge) there&#39;s a<br/>
doorway.  Go through that door and follow the right<br/>
wall.  There&#39;s one passage that will loop back (ends at a<br/>
window above a previous area), but if you skip it and keep<br/>
following the right wall, it&#39;ll take you straight to the room<br/>
with the Solusek Mage.  The room immediately prior to this,<br/>
there&#39;s a door on the left which leads to the king room.  So<br/>
it&#39;s actually not that bad a place to use as a base and pull<br/>
to.  <br/>

You *will* need a group.  Just clear as you go, and be careful<br/>
to give yourself time for when the room respawns.  I had a<br/>
full L30-36 group overwhelmed in here because we had a 4<br/>
goblin pull when the room goblins started to spawn (two<br/>
healers too, never did find the second, probably healing<br/>
through the walls).  This is the high level goblin portion of<br/>
Sol A by the way.<br/>
