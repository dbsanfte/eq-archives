<div id="ygrps-yiv-259449178">I was gonna buy an obsidian shard until I got one for myself the other day.<br/>
Several people I talked with in game told me they go for 500-600PP.  If you<br/>
want to get one for yourself, I would guess you would need a full party in<br/>
their mid 20s.  The kobold predator (as well as the goblin foreman who drops<br/>
the obsidian scimitar) was blue to me at 32d level.  All other stuff that<br/>
spawns near him was green to me at 32.  You can get to his spawn point very<br/>
easy with invis song as long as you don&#39;t run into a goblin wizard or shaman<br/>
along the way.  When I was there this past weekend, I never saw a wizard or<br/>
shaman along the path to the predator but I just got lucky.<br/>

&gt; reasonably<br/>
&gt; sell for?  I was thinking of picking up one or the other and wondered what<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; might expect to pay.  I&#39;m still a ways from taking either of those mobs<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; my own group unfortunately.  Any other ideas of what might be comparable<br/>
&gt; other than Claws?  I currently use a PGT and another weapon that varies<br/>
&gt; according to situation.<br/>
