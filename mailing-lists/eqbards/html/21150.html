<div id="ygrps-yiv-850194970">Some random PoF thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
On Innoruuk, we have a player based &quot;summit&quot; where the &quot;major&quot; guilds met<br/>
and hashed out some basic rules and a reservation system for PoF and PoH<br/>
(PoS is considered FFA [free for all] as are draggins.)  Guilds can<br/>
&quot;reserve&quot; 2 dates (16 hour slots) for planes and the others respect their<br/>
times See www.innoruuk.com and follow the link to the summit rules. There&#39;s<br/>
also a calendar there - you can see who has what booked when.  Weeekends get<br/>
booked month&#39;s in advance. If a date is not booked, you and your pals can<br/>
hop in and have a FFA night if you so desire.  This has worked remarkably<br/>
well for us.<br/>
<br/>
Last Friday, I heard through the grapevine that some folks had a total wipe<br/>
out trying to break PoF at the south west wall (why they chose sw - I have<br/>
no clue).  So, a bunch of our guild mustered forces and we went in to break<br/>
the west wall and start them doing CR.  We had like 3 groups and were<br/>
cutting down mobs nicely when the server decided to lag out for a good<br/>
minute.  When it let up, we were all dead.  Heh, some of us were so<br/>
confident of the break that we did not bother to bind anywhere close so it<br/>
took a bit for us to get back to the TV and hop on in virtually naked.  We<br/>
looted down to res corpses and finished the break.  Then came the most<br/>
dangerous part: bringing the other guild&#39;s folks back in.  It can be a real<br/>
nightmare when inexperienced people who you can&#39;t easily communicate with<br/>
start running around in a panic.  Anyhow, we got them set and gated on out.<br/>
<br/>
We got a couple higher level folks on our server who like to brag about how<br/>
few ppl they can break PoF with. Well, whoopity do, when you go in with 2<br/>
groups of high level pet casters and fight blue mobs til it looks bad then<br/>
gate out to the TV, rinse repeat. And their story is always the same: &quot;we<br/>
cleared PoF with 10 ppl, except for the Temple, CT & Dracho and some misc<br/>
roamers far from where we were...&quot;  All I can say is:  &quot;we clear PoF<br/>
completely, kill Dracho, pull Temple w/o a sacrifical person, kill CT and<br/>
are done by 1am on a weeknight.&quot;  Another guild has done it in like 3 hours.<br/>
Having mid 50 to 60 level ppl makes all the difference.  When we were capped<br/>
at 50, CT was dieing but it was 5am or later sometimes.<br/>

&gt; I can see where Sartori is coming from, and while you may have taken<br/>
offense<br/>
&gt; to his response, you shouldn&#39;t have.  I&#39;m guessing here, but I think<br/>
Sartori<br/>
&gt; comes from a day when if you wanted to do fear, you had to break it </span></blockquote></div>
