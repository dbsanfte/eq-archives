<div id="ygrps-yiv-713040097">I mentioned this before, but I had logged into Everquest, and even had my<br/>
weapons in the Freeport bank.  I was simply mastering my brewing trade in<br/>
the bar by the bank.  During this time, (NOT singing or playing) received<br/>
faction notices for people killing freeport NPCs!  Yet I have noticed no<br/>
faction difference from the Freeport militia, and even had three or four<br/>
notices over a few hours.  Since I&#39;m not using the sewers to navigate the<br/>
town, I&#39;m not worried as of yet, unsure if I really had a faction adjustment<br/>
or not.  Perhaps we receive the notice but don&#39;t actually get adjusted?<br/>
<br/>
Understand, not singing or playing, even in another building in the market<br/>
square where the battle is taking place!  Best I can come up with, perhaps I<br/>
had given a warrior free Fierce Brew and they had gone and slaughtered<br/>
someone under its influence.<br/>

&gt;I must agree.  While in CB, I noticed that I was getting faction hit from<br/>
&gt;Mobs that my group did not attack.  I don&#39;t understand what happened to<br/>
&gt;cause this, but I can be somewhat annoying.<br/>

&gt;I think that we should petition about our hit list.  We should not be hated<br/>
&gt;by every agressive npc that we meet.  For example, i would be standing<br/>
&gt;healing myself then suddenly these Orc&#39;s warriors from all the way from the<br/>
&gt;distance would rush up and beat me to a pulp.  or when they would not<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;the nearest pc but would travel the extra distance just to attack u.<br/>
&gt;Another rant is we would get a faction hit for doing nothing at all except<br/>
&gt;being near the MOB&#39;s death.  Don&#39;t you all think this is very annoying.<br/>
