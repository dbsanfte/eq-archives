<b>Subject:</b> Galtin&#39;s misadventure + some questions about corpses in the ocean <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-55414541">Last night while waiting for the boat on the Butcherblock dock I volunteered<br/>
to assist another player locate his corpse.  He said that he crashed while<br/>
riding the boat and that when he logged back on he started out at the bottom<br/>
of the ocean.  He eventually ran out of stamina and died.  He also stated<br/>
that his corpse was somewhere in the ocean in the Butcherblock zone.  I<br/>
started singing the locating song and immediately got a bearing on his<br/>
corpse.  I told him to follow me and I jumped into the ocean.  I continued<br/>
swimming along the bearing until I ran into the zone barrier.  I was<br/>
underwater at the time I ran into the zone barrier.  His corpse was nowhere<br/>
in sight. At this point, I apparently encountered a bug because I could no<br/>
longer swim in any direction.  It was like I was stuck to the zone barrier.<br/>
I still had plenty of air left but all attempts at breaking away from the<br/>
zone were unsuccessful. I tried every arrow key, the PageUp key, and<br/>
PageDown key.  Nothing.  I eventually drowned myself.  <br/>
<br/>
When I died, I got the overhead view of my corpse.  The funny thing is that<br/>
there was someone (in full armor) walking around the bottom of the ocean<br/>
next to my corpse.  The person had two names but I couldn&#39;t tell if it was a<br/>
player or a NPC. It looked like a human and I know for certain it wasn&#39;t a<br/>
dwarven guard.  I know bards have an underwater breathing song<br/>
(unfortunately for me I&#39;m not high enough yet to sing it) but does the song<br/>
allow you to walk on the bottom of the ocean?  Do other classes have spells<br/>
that allow them to breathe underwater?<br/>
<br/>
Now my character is back in Freeport and will have to ride the boat back to<br/>
retrieve his corpse.  Adding insult to injury, I won&#39;t have time to retrieve<br/>
my corpse before the boat leaves Butcherblock so I will have to wait until<br/>
it makes the round trip back from Freeport.  Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I would like to know:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was supposed to<br/>
happen?  <br/>
2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck again if I<br/>
try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to pull my<br/>
corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s corpse?  My<br/>
theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but in the Ocean<br/>
of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the right<br/>
direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you are looking<br/>
for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of Tears zone<br/>
then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse was in the<br/>
Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.  <br/>
4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on the<br/>
bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to /petition.<br/>
Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>
retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I sure<br/>
hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to retrieve it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time for any replies.<br/>
