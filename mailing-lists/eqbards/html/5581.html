<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-270088066"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well I spoke with a GM regarding this and he informed me<br/>
&gt; that the patch message was in error.  It documents changes<br/>
&gt; that will be in the *next* release.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone mentioned (on this list?) a feature possibly being <br/>
added that sends a tell to your friends list.. The feature<br/>
would be used by doing a &quot;/ftell &lt;message&gt;&quot; - interesting<br/>
note that you can do this now, but your friends don&#39;t <br/>
actually get a message. Gives you a response of &quot;You tell<br/>
your friends &lt;message&gt;&quot;.</div>
