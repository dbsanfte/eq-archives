<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575238655">i think at amiable it may even be lower (whatever faction a newbie gnome in<br/>
ak&#39;anon has with the gnome armory).  i guess a gnome in ak&#39;anon may start<br/>
kindly or warmly, but at 95 CHA (base plus all starting points) with my mule<br/>
gnome enchanter that i created many moons ago to buy my steel plate, i got<br/>
the same armor prices i got with 100 CHA and more.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The long and the short of it is, charisma and faction can <br/>
&gt; contribute to a <br/>
&gt; combined difference in cost of perhaps 40% of the total cost <br/>
&gt; (from worst <br/>
&gt; case to best case) but in most situations it&#39;s far less than <br/>
&gt; this.  I know, <br/>
&gt; for example, that a druid friend of mine can buy gate potions <br/>
&gt; for about <br/>
&gt; 1400pp, while they cost me around 1100pp (no, never bought <br/>
&gt; one, but I like <br/>
&gt; to window shop).  That&#39;s a 27% difference, and quite a bit of <br/>
&gt; cash to save.  <br/>
&gt; Sorry I can&#39;t give exact answers - for what it&#39;s worth, CHA <br/>
&gt; 110, faction <br/>
&gt; amiable is my guess for where prices bottom out.<br/>
