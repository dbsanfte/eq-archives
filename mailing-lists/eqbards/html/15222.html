<div id="ygrps-yiv-33835987">The anecdotal evidence that this is true is overwhelming.  Deaths at 31 were<br/>
overwhelming.  Everyone and I mean EVERYONE I talk to says this is true.<br/>
I&#39;m currently 36 and fortunately have not died yet...<br/>

&gt; It happened again, but slightly differently this time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I was level 30, I lost about a quarter bubble per death.<br/>
&gt; I reached 31, then died without having gained any experience.<br/>
&gt; I lost a bit more than a half bubble into 30.<br/>
