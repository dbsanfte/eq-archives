<b>Subject:</b> Need Input on Charm and Pixie Strike <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-284436400">Before I got these two songs, I looked forward to them very much, now that I<br/>
have them (and I have had them for quite a while now) I cannot seem to use<br/>
these to great effect.<br/>
<br/>
Some bards on the list have said that charm is the greatest thing since<br/>
sliced bread yada yada yada.  My problem is that sure I can charm a critter,<br/>
but 5-20 seconds later, it is back wacking the &%^$ out of me!  So then I<br/>
try to continually &quot;recharm&quot; the creature, this works a little better, but I<br/>
am still getting attacked by my &quot;pet&quot; about 25% of the time.  Am I doing<br/>
something wrong? Is there a trick to it?<br/>
<br/>
The other song I have problems with is Pixie Strike.  What real use is this<br/>
song?  You have to target the creature you want to strike, then NO ONE can<br/>
hit it while it is in lala land, or it wakes up.  What this means is<br/>
effectively to keep a monster out of the fight I have to keep it targeted<br/>
and continually sing pixie strike at it, and not attack anything else.  Why<br/>
not use lullaby (aside from the obvious area effect dangers) and just have<br/>
everyone in the party attack the same MOB?<br/>
<br/>
Please give me some direction on each of these, as I would love to use them<br/>
more!<br/>
