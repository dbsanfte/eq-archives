<div id="ygrps-yiv-915592223">Carillion is hard to start until you get your wind skill up.  I used to get<br/>
75% failures till I maxed wind, then got about 5-10% until about 2 weeks ago<br/>
when it increased to 25%.  I tried it 50 times with wind at 13, suceeded 14<br/>
times.  Tried 50 times with 75 skill, suceeded 46 times, tried last nite 50<br/>
times at 83 skill, suceeded 41 times.  Also my dex and wisdom are both 5<br/>
points higher than they were at 75 skill and my char is still at 121.  And<br/>
to think I originally did this just to see how much effect music skill<br/>
really had on missed notes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t include my Carrilon details, because I assumed that certain songs<br/>
are just a pain in general.  But I do have at least a 50% failure rate on<br/>
it, even at 15th.   Anyone else notice the Charisma song being tough to<br/>
start?  The Lullaby (which I just got) starts normally, even if it is<br/>
resisted 50% of the time *chuckles*<br/>
