<div id="ygrps-yiv-984197963">Funny, everyone remembers her from WK, but I know I was in Qhills, right<br/>
around the tower on the way TO WK. I know because i looked in the tower<br/>
looking for this guard she disliked so much.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you happen upon a Guard&#39;s body and happen to loot a no-drop<br/>
&quot;guard bracer&quot; and think &quot;maybe this is the one the Captain in NK guard<br/>
tower is looking for&quot; and you decide to give it to him, If you are wrong<br/>
and it is from a good guard, you better be ready to take the jump off<br/>
the tower, because is appears he can tell the difference... not that I<br/>
would know (rubbing his backside from the fall).<br/>
