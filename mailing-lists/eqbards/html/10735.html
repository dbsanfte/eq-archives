<div id="ygrps-yiv-111502700">Well I must admit that my speed did indeed cause what several people told me<br/>
was &#39;the biggest train in Cazic-Thule that I&#39;ve ever seen&#39;.  A few levels<br/>
back before I knew Cazic-Thule better than the route from bedroom to<br/>
bathroom in my house, I was at the back of the Archon temple with a group.<br/>
We got overrun by lizards and were in the process of getting wiped out.  I<br/>
equipped my drum and hit Selo&#39;s and took off when &quot;zone&quot; was called.  I sped<br/>
around the temple once, picking up lizards the whole way.  I came a full 360<br/>
around the base of the building to try and pick up any still-breathing party<br/>
members with my song.  There were none, so I proceeded to speed another 180<br/>
degrees around the building to the exit into the maze.  By now I&#39;m trailing<br/>
maybe 15-20 lizards behind me.  Then I hit the maze.  The maze is just that,<br/>
and I got lost.  While frantically searching for the way out, I&#39;m getting<br/>
hit by lizards that I blaze past and picking them up in turn.  Well by the<br/>
time I finally managed to stagger into the courtyard croak I&#39;ve got an<br/>
untold number of lizards on my ass.  I was only informed of my apparent<br/>
informal record-setting status during my corpse retrieval, often with<br/>
language that would make a Army Sergeant blush.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those events that taught me that sometimes it *is* just best<br/>
to die.<br/>

&gt; This would be true if they gated out of the zone, but noooooo,<br/>
&gt; these beight<br/>
&gt; ones gated to the zone entry.  Naturally the gobs all headed that way<br/>
&gt; immediately.  Also since SoW can last for 25+ minutes its pretty easy for<br/>
&gt; SoW casters to still have speed underground and cause huge trains so that<br/>
&gt; only the bards get their speed taken away.<br/>

&gt; PS Yes Unrest is famous for trains.  None of the ones I have seen were<br/>
&gt; caused by speedy runners but by stupid parties.  Its the lower level,<br/>
&gt; greater incompetence, and large agro radius that causes horrible trains in<br/>
&gt; Unrest.  The more pickup groups that are in a zone the more trains there<br/>
&gt; are.  The worst trains of all occur in Guk where it is underground.  Being<br/>
&gt; above ground is not the train causing factor at least in Unrest,<br/>
&gt; never spent<br/>
&gt; any time in Mistmoore so not sure about there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; had zero chance of escape and the caster&#39;s had zero chance of<br/>
&gt; death.  And<br/>
&gt; &gt; they said Selo&#39;s was unbalancing in allowing train avoidance indoors?<br/>
&gt; Yeah,<br/>
&gt; &gt; right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not quite.  They are not concerned about you avoiding a train.  They don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want you pulling huge trains to zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How fast travel can be unbalancing but instantaneous travelling is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not I fail to see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Instantaneous travel doesn&#39;t cause the train to keep running to<br/>
&gt; zone.  Fast<br/>
&gt; travel allows someone to lead the entire dungeon to the<br/>
&gt; zone exit, causing many people to die.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Think about some of the worst zones for random deaths from trains,<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore, Unrest, BlackBurrow.  All these zones are &quot;outdoors&quot;<br/>
&gt; and allow speed effects.  The trainmaker can run fast and make it to zone,<br/>
&gt; and lets everyone else deal with the trainwreck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the dungeons that are &quot;underground&quot;  there are usually less trains to<br/>
&gt; zone (there are exceptions).  This is because the person<br/>
&gt; who gets over his head can&#39;t run fast enough to make it to zone.<br/>
&gt; They will<br/>
&gt; die 20 feet away and the train never happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A caster gating out has the same effect as death.  The monster drops the<br/>
&gt; player off the hate list.  Unless someone else is also on<br/>
&gt; the hate list (or too close), the monster will return to it&#39;s normal spot.<br/>
