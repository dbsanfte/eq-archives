&gt; Has any server even managed to kill one mob in the fear plane since it was<br/>

for a L49 bard?) but I dropped in on the weekend to chat with friends<br/>
and heard one particularly depressing story. <br/>
<br/>
18 people went to PoF on Tarrew last week to try to do some adventuring.<br/>
Within 5 minutes they were all dead. It took 9 hours for some of them to<br/>
get their bodies back. Some of them never did and have quit the game.<br/>
Others, in frustration, allowed themselves to die until they were<br/>
knocked back to L45, at which time they were able to get their bodies<br/>
retrieved for them by a GM as they were unable to enter the PoF anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 20+ people I used to adventure with regularly on Tarrew Marr, 3<br/>
were logged in on Saturday as their L50 characters. The rest may have<br/>
been on as alternates, though the ones I know the names of definately<br/>
weren&#39;t. Of the Bard&#39;s I know on the server, several have left the game<br/>
at L48-49 without even bothering to get 50.<br/>
