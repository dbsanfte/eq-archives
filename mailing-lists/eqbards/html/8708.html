<b>Subject:</b> Purchase prices for quest components <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-415499002">Until I gain 4-5 more levels, the only way I will be able to acquire any of<br/>
the bard quest components is to purchase the looting rights from someone.<br/>
Because these are all new items, the market for them hasn&#39;t really been<br/>
established yet.  As a result, I don&#39;t have a really good idea on how much<br/>
PP to offer for the looting rights.  If anyone out there gets a quest<br/>
component by paying for the looting rights, request you post how much you<br/>
paid for it.  That will give me and other bards in my situation a good<br/>
starting point in our negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
