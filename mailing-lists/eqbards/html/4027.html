will hit stuff through walls, floors, and ceilings.<br/>
Unfortunately, the only way to learn where not to use them is<br/>
to use them in the wrong places.  :-( Some places in Guk are<br/>
safe, others are not.  Permafrost so far has been pretty safe,<br/>
as have been Befallen and Najena.  Paw looked like it had some<br/>
problems, but most of the stuff was green when I first went<br/>
there so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Dunno about Runnyeye - that<br/>
place has been deadly for me so I never even bothered trying<br/>
area effect songs in there.  One outdoor zone you should be<br/>
careful in is Mistmoore - parts of the castle interior are<br/>
behind solid walls, and the level range for mobs there goes<br/>
from about 20-53.  You think you are using Lullaby on a L20<br/>
familiar, and suddenly a L45 mob is casting spells at you<br/>
through the walls.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup, if your friends are only attacking one mob (which is<br/>
usually the best strategy) and you play a buff/debuff,<br/>
anything they&#39;re not attacking will start attacking you.  <br/>
Make sure there is a healer in your group, preferably two.<br/>
Paladins are good too since most will glady use their Lay<br/>
Hands to keep alive the bard who is holding those 3 other<br/>
nasty mobs at bay with Lullaby.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; heck, I&#39;ll head over to good ole unrest, what could be<br/>
&gt; safer?  Get there, find some good friends I could<br/>
&gt; trust, and we get to slayin undead.  One of the dry<br/>
&gt; bones makes a run for the house, silly bard that I am,<br/>
&gt; I chase him, again, still singing a song, forget which<br/>
&gt; one.  Withing seconds the doors fly open and carrion,<br/>
&gt; monks and the reclusive ghoul magi beeline right at<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a pathing bug in Unrest.  If a mob from the house gets<br/>
pulled to the zone and walks back, it almost always stops just<br/>
inside the front door.  If this happens to a train, you get<br/>
10-20 mobs all piled up on one square inside the front door.<br/>
Pull one and a good number will follow.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Fighting a while, see a wisp to the left of the house,<br/>
&gt; facing the back.  Someone in my guild needed a light<br/>
&gt; stone, so I run to grab it, while singing my little<br/>
&gt; anthem.  All of a sudden, the hag 3 floors up starts<br/>
&gt; casting on me from a window, and I wake up at home<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, this is the &quot;casting mob someone else is fighting turning<br/>
around to cast a spell on a nearby bard who isn&#39;t hurting it&quot;<br/>
syndrome.  In Highpass and Crushbone it was just walking sleep<br/>
and root being cast on you as you stood there with Accelerando<br/>
playing, watching someone else fight.  In Unrest, it&#39;s the<br/>
hags dropping 10 ton anvils on you from the sky.  I usually<br/>
stop all songs when I see a hag nearby, or if we&#39;re not<br/>
fighting switch to invisibility.  All the more reason to pull<br/>
to the walls.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; among the trees.  That sucked.  Does this mean we<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t use any of our aoe or buffs anywhere near a<br/>
&gt; dungeon?  Well, at least my calves are built up from<br/>
&gt; zone running :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess you just learn to live with it.  Others learn to deal<br/>
with dying from being unable to outrun mobs, we learn to deal<br/>
with dying from being attacked by stuff we never saw.<br/>
