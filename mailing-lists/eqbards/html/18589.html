<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732347966">Hehe, sorry.  &quot;Uber-guild&quot; means different things on different servers, but I basically meant that they<br/>
were the first guild (by far) to be capable of doing Planes and Dragons, and they are still stunningly<br/>
efficient at it.  For awhile, other guilds would ask them to step back and give them a shot at Dragons,<br/>
they would give the guild 24 hours, then they&#39;d step in and do it in 2.  :)  They&#39;re an extraordinarily<br/>
capable and well-organized guild.  With that, in some cases, comes a touch of arrogance which is kind of<br/>
off-putting, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s anywhere near as bad on Innoruuk as on other servers, and of<br/>
course, it&#39;s still dependent on the individual.  I didn&#39;t realize they were as small as they are; I&#39;m even<br/>
more impressed now!<br/>
<br/>
I forgot about some of the daytime and foreign guilds.  They&#39;re big, too, now that I think about who I see<br/>
around when I&#39;m on at 10am EST.  Yesterday, I saw two Avenguardia members talking French.  In Dark<br/>
Elvish.  Now that will twist your head a little!<br/>

Kenross Cantoforjado, 49 songs, Innoruuk (who was asked the other day whose twink he was because he wasn&#39;t<br/>
level 50 yet.  Aaaargh!)<br/>

&gt;   Again I plead ignorance... What do you mean by an &quot;uber-guild&quot;?  That&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; new one I have not seen before :)<br/>
