&gt; Ok, I have a question for you all.  I am a level 25 Bard on the Rallos Zek<br/>
&gt; server.  I have read with interest your emails, suggestions, and tips, but I<br/>
&gt; seem to have a problem.  I can not use the same songs in the same way as<br/>
&gt; you.  My sleep song puts EVERYONE but my party to sleep, including other<br/>
&gt; players, in fact any NON Party song effects mobs and players.  This is a<br/>
&gt; real disadvantage to me I believe.  Anyone on RZ with any suggestions? Or<br/>
&gt; anyone else ?  Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nevertheless, it&#39;s more realistic.  I actually happen to miss<br/>
this component of combat tactics from Diablo and UO.  You had<br/>
to think carefully about how you used area effect spells/songs<br/>
since you could fry your teammates or passerbys.  Of course it<br/>
doesn&#39;t help that area effect songs don&#39;t have pretty graphics<br/>
to show you their extent like area effect spells do.  (Then<br/>
again, people complain enough already about the lag bards <br/>
cause. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could suggest Verant replace one of the &quot;useless&quot;<br/>
songs (e.g. Charisma or Identify) with a targeted lullaby<br/>
which only works on a single mob?  I died yesterday because<br/>
I ran across a newbie (level 5) being beat up by two bandits.  <br/>
I started my lullaby to make it a fair one-on-one fight, and<br/>
shortly afterwards a wandering guard killed me.<br/>
