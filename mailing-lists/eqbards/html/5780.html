&gt; Perhaps the moderator of this list can send an email to Verant and request<br/>
&gt; that the bard programmer join this list.  Include in the message that we<br/>

GZ on Bards<br/>
Verant Game Designer Geoffrey Zatkin recently responded to an email written<br/>
by Solos Chimamire concerning spells used by the Bard class. Here&#39;s the<br/>
response accompanied by the questions: (Solos&#39; words are in normal text,<br/>
Geoffrey&#39;s response is in italics)<br/>
Hello folks,<br/>
I&#39;ve recently wrote to GZ and made some suggestions regarding bard songs,<br/>
and he is kind enough to give me a reply, here&#39;s what he said:<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
Level 40 Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aria - The name of this song suggests that it<br/>
will have some &#39;anti-magic&#39; effect, so I assume perhaps interrupt casting /<br/>
dispell magic / reduce magic resistance, etc. However it does none of the<br/>
above, in fact, I have not been able to figure out what it actually does.<br/>
<br/>
Got a fix going in on the next spell patch.<br/>
<br/>
Level 43 Denon&#39;s Desparate Dirge - While the 275 damage is a blast, this<br/>
song often targets *grouped* PC, making it useless if you cast it on mobs<br/>
surrounded by your group member. I&#39;ve done it many many times and often the<br/>
song doesn&#39;t do any damage as it targetted all the grouped PC. Also as the<br/>
name suggest, it should be used in a desparate situation, perhaps when the<br/>
bard is surrounded by mobs, pounding to death.. the type of damage (ie. AoE)<br/>
isn&#39;t really helping at that situation, as you need to run away from the<br/>
chasing mob, far enough so it won&#39;t hurt you, then sing the song and hope<br/>
that it will target them instead of PC. So a suggestion is perhaps change it<br/>
to be a PB song instead - and maybe even stun the mobs for a little while?<br/>
<br/>
I have a tweek for this going in on the next spell patch as well. Tell me<br/>
what you think.<br/>
<br/>
Next I would like to send in a few suggestions on songs that works, but<br/>
would be able to work better :<br/>
<br/>
Level 19 Shauri`s Sonorous Clouding - This song works great - to NPC only.<br/>
The song effect is giving out bard location to any PC and make it unless in<br/>
PvP situations. It also lets you follow your party members while invis -<br/>
which do you think (honestly) is more important?<br/>
<br/>
Level 27 Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens - While I understand this song could be<br/>
powerful, yet it is still dangerous to use, as uncharmed mob will really<br/>
really get mad at you. So I wonder why it cannot share the same properties<br/>
as other charm spells, ie. determine by the magic resistance and level of<br/>
the charmer and charmee (?) to decide whether a charm is successful, instead<br/>
of putting a hard coded cap on it?<br/>
<br/>
We have the hard coded cap in because while Bards are good at Charming, they<br/>
are not the masters of it. Only Enchanters are the masters of charming.<br/>
<br/>
Level 44 Cassindra&#39;s Elegy - Even though this song is great that it gives<br/>
some extra INT and WIS to our caster friends, yet it is short lasting and<br/>
the extra mana given by the increase in INT/WIS doesn&#39;t help at all, so a<br/>
better usage of this song is perhaps make the effect last longer?<br/>
<br/>
This was intended to be a hard song to use well. The extra Int AND Wis from<br/>
the same spell are so nice that we needed a drawback.<br/>
<br/>
- How about a DD song with higher damage (lower than that of Desparate<br/>
Dirge), but cost mana as well (eg. 200 mana for 100 dmg?) - A memory blurr /<br/>
atone type song? Probably wont get the dd spell - Bards are not really DD<br/>
characters.<br/>
<br/>
The memory blur one is possible - i am testing out some of the final songs -<br/>
if i don&#39;t like how they work, i may sub in a blur.<br/>
