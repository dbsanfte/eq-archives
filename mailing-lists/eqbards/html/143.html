<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209989455">I feel debate is a form of information also. I wish one would not back down<br/>
from their oppugn for fear of disapproval, or worse yet a feeling that they<br/>
may cause division. For if we are all fluffy bunnies and spend all our time<br/>
just trying to get along we will become stagnate and meaningless. As the<br/>
quote goes &#39;A little revolution is a good thing every now and then&#39; - by a<br/>
human called Thomas Jefferson (or at least that is what a gypsy seer told<br/>
me. Then again she also said, get this, there will only be humans around<br/>
then and that the only Elves, Half-Elves, Dwarfs, Etc. will be Pimply kids<br/>
pretending to be ones with Flashing boxes over metal wires! What was she<br/>
drinking I wonder?).<br/>

&gt;  heh, and to think all this started from one post stating dissaproval<br/>
&gt; of a guild...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I meant no dissrespect to the Bardic guild in question. What they are<br/>
&gt; trying to do is take roleplaying to one more level which is quite<br/>
&gt; admirable in my belief. But that is all it is, a belief. Again I<br/>
&gt; apologize for sounding brash in any way, my mouth tends to get me into<br/>
&gt; trouble anyway. (Most Orcs don&#39;t like being reminded of their large<br/>
&gt; rear ends...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regardless, I had hoped this mailing list wouldn&#39;t turn into a debate<br/>
&gt; between us, for we should use this opportunity to help each other in<br/>
&gt; the difficult world of a Norrath community. Not to slander each other.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps my meaning was misunderstood before I had scrybed it down. I<br/>
&gt; again apologize.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also hope this can end our debate so that we can focus our attention<br/>
&gt; to matters of bardic excellence.<br/>
