&gt; Rokenn&#39;s song analysis for the 30th level song says that even though the<br/>
&gt; song lists percussion as the supporting instrument, equipping a drum doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; increase the damage of the DOT or raise the amount of magic resistance the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes it&#39;s true.  Yes it was submitted as a bug.  Yes, Verant<br/>
claimed to have fixed it.  No, it wasn&#39;t fixed, at least as of<br/>
two weeks ago when I tested it.<br/>
