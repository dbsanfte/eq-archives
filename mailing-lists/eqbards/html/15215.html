wanted to comment on something here.<br/>

&gt; leading them (no songs of course).  We come to a Kirukai (sp?) warrior and a<br/>
&gt; Cleric of Innoruuk that are blocking our path.  Death time.  The two mobs<br/>
&gt; both passed me close enough that I could smell their aftershave to chase my<br/>
&gt; level 46 Ranger friend around.  Then they start wailing on the others in my<br/>
&gt; group that are higher level than I am as I stand there watching.  Well after<br/>
&gt; a few rounds of not being hit I decided maybe I shouldn&#39;t just stand there<br/>
&gt; indefinitly waiting my turn for a dirtnap, so I darted out the door and up<br/>
&gt; the zone wall and camped out to clear their agro lists.  Nothing ever agrod<br/>
&gt; on me.  In fact by the time my camping process was at 15 seconds everyone<br/>
&gt; else in my party was dead.  The mobs didn&#39;t come for me.  That&#39;s pretty<br/>
&gt; unusual, but isn&#39;t conclusive.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This only seems unusual to us bards.  :)  While playing around<br/>
with sneak in various zones with no songs playing, I found out<br/>
this is how the game works for everyone *except* us.  If a mob<br/>
is aggroed on someone, you can be inside its aggro radius and<br/>
it won&#39;t aggro on you (unless you&#39;re close enough that it<br/>
decides to attack you instead).  I&#39;ve had giants, frogloks,<br/>
kobolds, and various bugs all run through me and never aggro<br/>
on me (should /con threatening while in sneak mode and behind<br/>
them).<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the way it works for bards is that if you&#39;re in<br/>
the aggro radius and your song pulses, that almost always adds<br/>
you to the hate list.<br/>
