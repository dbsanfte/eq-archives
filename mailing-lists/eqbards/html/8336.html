<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430193064">When playing your bard in Norrath what is your favorite:<br/>
<br/>
 Day of the week to play:  Sunday, Monday, and whenever my wife is away.<br/>
(&quot;Honey, Do you know how I got signed up for three bowling leagues?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Time of day: 7pm - 12am Central Time, if I play responsibly &lt;cough&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Longest stretch of continuous play: 12 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Way to have game sounds: High enough to actually hear the Bellow. Still<br/>
working on it (&quot;Honey, what&#39;s this receipt for a 500W amp?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Distance to sit from display: 2 ft. Closer when I lean in to look around<br/>
corners.<br/>
<br/>
TV show to have on: VH1&#39;s Behind the Music. Did you know some of those guys<br/>
have drug problems?<br/>
<br/>
Music to listen to: Enya, Celtic harp, concert band classical and jazz,<br/>
Sting, Metallica, Rush. (What, no opera??)<br/>
<br/>
Beverage (non-alcoholic):  water<br/>
<br/>
Beverage (alcoholic): Killian&#39;s Red (rarely)<br/>
<br/>
Health Food:  bread to go with the water. I suffer for my EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Junk Food: the occasional Dum Dum sucker. I&#39;ve actually lost weight since<br/>
starting EQ. Who has time to eat?<br/>
<br/>
Clothes to wear: Start with dress shirt, tie, dockers (who changes BEFORE<br/>
they get their first kill?). Eventually end up in sweats and slippers (it&#39;s<br/>
cold up here in MinneSOTa).<br/>
