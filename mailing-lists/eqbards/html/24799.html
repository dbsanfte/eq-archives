<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098476509">They were NEVER mezzed.  Never got a resist message - just got the initial<br/>
message you get when singing SoT.  The Enchanter was unable to mez them<br/>
either - and in fact died the second time it happened.  Both times I started<br/>
trying to mez it after the enchanter died; the second time we evaced out -<br/>
although I had gotten the mez to finally stick in between the time the Druid<br/>
cast the Evac and when it hit.<br/>

If they were mezzed they couldnt cast :)  Even if you mez them in mid cast<br/>
the spell is interupted.<br/>
<br/>
Were the mobs resisting mez or breaking quickly?<br/>
