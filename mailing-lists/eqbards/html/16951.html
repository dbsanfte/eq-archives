<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494436143">The big myth is that screech causes trains - it doesn&#39;t if you evac or<br/>
zone.  The mobs are running away and other people only get added to the<br/>
hate lists if they attempt to attack.  Once the offending parties zone the<br/>
mobs will continue to run until fear wears off and then will mosey on back<br/>
to their spawn spots.<br/>
<br/>
I really can&#39;t see how using dirge to clear the path for evac is useful:<br/>
In the same 3 seconds you could either hit 4 mobs and yourself for 300-odd<br/>
damage or clear away a good 90% of the mobs for the duration of the evac.<br/>
