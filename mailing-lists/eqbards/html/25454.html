<br/>
* Bards *<br/>
<br/>
Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage<br/>
physically of all the classes we&#39;re discussing.  However, with their lack<br/>
of double attack they didn&#39;t meet even our intentions for their damage<br/>
output.  We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon<br/>
caps for bards over 50th level to match that of warriors.  This should<br/>
place their ability to do damage by means of melee within our intended<br/>
range without making them more effective than the knights at any given<br/>
level, since double attack is a potent melee skill that bards do not get.<br/>
