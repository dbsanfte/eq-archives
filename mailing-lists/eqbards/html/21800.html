<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261080412">No problem, I can gladly expound.  Much of it comes from the fact I turned<br/>
18 or so right about the time the Lullaby nerf went into play with no<br/>
warning.<br/>
<br/>
Before that time, every battle where more than one mob came into play there<br/>
was a serious tactical question being posed.  Should I Lullaby or<br/>
Chords/Denon&#39;s?  Since one would break the other I could never do both.  In<br/>
addition at that point Anthem was still very viable even with an enchanter.<br/>
Chains was also pre nerf and a very viable option for Snare.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t really that gaining levels has reduced the options, changes made to<br/>
the options since then have.  Chains is no longer a reliable alternative to<br/>
Snare, Lullaby is useful for nothing except suicide, and the upgrade, Pixie<br/>
Strike, is nearly as ineffective.  An enchanter at this level can keep an<br/>
entire set of tanks &quot;Hasted&quot; and keep all the additional mobs mezz&#39;d using<br/>
only his own Clarity spell for support.  Indefinitely.  My Anthem is a poor<br/>
substitute for the Enchanter line of &quot;Haste&quot; spells.<br/>
There really isn&#39;t much question of which songs are most effective at this<br/>
level.  Swapping instruments, Chant, Chords, and Hymn are numerically now so<br/>
much more effective than anything else I can do that doing anything else is<br/>
pointless except in very special situations such as when high MR is needed.<br/>
Enchanters have also become so much more necessary for a group as I have<br/>
increased in levels.  When I was 18th level a bard was an excellent option<br/>
vs. and enchanter or a ranger or a druid or a shadowknight when it came to<br/>
grouping.  Now we are such a poor second choice to any of these that a group<br/>
would only take a bard if none of the others were available.  We were once<br/>
2nd or 3rd best at a lot of things.  At 31 I have found we are 3rd best or<br/>
worse at many things, except strangely soloing with charm or fear/chains<br/>
neither of which is particularly enjoyable for someone who wanted a group<br/>
oriented class.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You got Sonorous Clouding, Consonant Chain, Appalling Screen, Song of the <br/>
&gt;Sirens. I agree, these aren&#39;t the best group songs, but all are highly <br/>
&gt;effective for the solo bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is it at level 18 that you were able to do that you are now unable to <br/>
&gt;do at 31? (no sarcasm here, I really do want to hear what you think.)<br/>
