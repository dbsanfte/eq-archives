<div id="ygrps-yiv-987645512">Side question about Gorenaire.  I was fighting along the castle north wall<br/>
in Dreads when a Gorenaire raid was going on.  I conned the dragon and I was<br/>
either warmly or amiable.  So I got close to take some screenshots since<br/>
this was the first time I had ever seen a dragon.  I had Selos up and was<br/>
standing right in front of Gorenaire when she decided to swat me.  Before I<br/>
realized what was going on, I was back at my bind point.  <br/>
<br/>
So did I die to a bug or will Gorenaire, once aggroed, attack anyone near<br/>
her, even if they weren&#39;t involved in the attack?  BTW I was not in wolf<br/>
form nor was I grouped with anyone at the time who had pets (which I have<br/>
been told will cause her to attack you).<br/>

&gt; He tested it on different songs and found that it is <br/>
&gt; substantially less powerful as an instrument than selo&#39;d drums or kelin&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve heard 75% of store-bought instrument level.  However, the hidden gem<br/>
is the SSS enhances singing songs as well.  A bard at Trakanon yesterday<br/>
returned +111 poison resist using psalm of purity with it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m currently 1 white scale away from getting my SSS.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at the same point, I&#39;d suggest Gorenaire if you don&#39;t have the low<br/>
levels to do Vox.  On my serv, three guilds team up to tackle the<br/>
difficult dragons.  We&#39;ve been able to take all three of the wanderers<br/>
down (Sev/Tal/Gor).  From what I could see, the &quot;trick&quot; to Gorenaire is<br/>
one part enchanters (sieving) and one part enough meleers so that not<br/>
everyone is feared at any given time.  I&#39;d estimate we had 10-12 groups<br/>
there to cover the fear reductions (pulled to BW zone to fight, fear path<br/>
ran east).<br/>
