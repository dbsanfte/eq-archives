<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634943456">level 36 increses agility for everyone in the party, but unfortunately does<br/>
not stack with anthem de arms or it would be very very nice.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; i have not purchased level 29 psalm of vitality or level 37 psalm of<br/>
&gt; purity because the only info i have seen on them is that they increase<br/>
&gt; SV for disease and poison.  i never found these very useful, and also<br/>
&gt; found it strange that two songs, both high level, would have this<br/>
&gt; effect.  does anyone have any actual experience using them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; also, level 35 denon&#39;s dissension, i have bought and used, though i<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really know what effect it is having on the targets.  i guess it<br/>
&gt; could just be an exact upgrade of level 18 denon&#39;s disruptive discord,<br/>
&gt; but if anyone knows it&#39;s true effects i&#39;d love to know if it does<br/>
&gt; anything different.<br/>

I believe Denon&#39;s Dissension is supposed to drain the enemies mana, kind<br/>
of the opposite of level 32 song.  How about level 36 song, i heard its<br/>
quite a good one when combined with anthem de arms.<br/>
