<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029715282"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 	Ack!  I lent out my Runed Bone Fork and forgot to get it back,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	It was cast twice then.  The AE at full damage doesn&#39;t even do<br/>
&gt; 800.  ~400 a shot is still high though and I&#39;ve never seen that much<br/>
&gt; damage when I was at Vox, even without a bard in my group with Miriana<br/>
&gt; (Naggy is a different story).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I lost two bubbles of health everytime I was hit with AE.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	Yeah, unfortunately we have no way of knowing how resists factor<br/>
&gt; in to the actual damage number, but most people reported dramatic<br/>
&gt; improvements.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I wish there was a way to find out about this.  Maybe next time I&#39;ll<br/>
  go without cold gear, to see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	Of fg&#39;s, or monsters in planes, or....  Hehe, any multi group<br/>
&gt; event is &quot;stare at wall&quot; time for me :).<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	According to Gallenite, all 3 deaths were due to LD&#39;s (and thereby<br/>
&gt; unhealable).  The real solution is to make 24 people sit in the king room<br/>
&gt; while the other 24 attack Vox.  With so many people going LD if you throw<br/>
&gt; 48 people at something you&#39;ve cut your effectiveness by nearly half<br/>
&gt; anyways.  Of course, no one wants to have the job of picking the 24 to<br/>
&gt; stay behind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That brings a sore point up too.  Gallenite picked all Pantheon<br/>
  members in the first 24 people, and sent all the others save a<br/>
  few to wait in the king room.  We waited until he said to come <br/>
  in which was about 30 seconds.  Two of the initial teams had<br/>
  no bards in them, yet I was sitting in the king room twiddling<br/>
  my fingers.  Two clerics in my group as well, and one melee group<br/>
  had none.  Group layout was inconsistent, not sure why.  I&#39;m<br/>
  starting to think Gallenite is holding something against me now,<br/>
  as he was the person who looted Evensong from me.  Ah well, time<br/>
  will tell.<br/>
