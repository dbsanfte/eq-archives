<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-684555170">Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List, a mailing list <br/>
dedicated to all for and about the Bard in EverQuest.<br/>
This list will be posted semi-regularly, and updated as often as is needed.<br/>
<br/>
05/23/2001 - Updated the weapon list. Added info on Sainy&#39;s Claw. If you <br/>
have any other instruments or weapons that should be added, please send the <br/>
details to the list (with spoiler space, please)<br/>
<br/>
05/23/2001 - Added some FAQs on general list information, updated some FAQs <br/>
(Clarity, item swapping).<br/>
<br/>
If you have any suggestions, corrections, or frequently asked questions, <br/>
please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
First, some basic rules:<br/>
(Common sense stuff, really)<br/>
<br/>
1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible). While we do often stray off the <br/>
path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the material &quot;of-interest&quot; to <br/>
our readers. Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are acceptable, because Bards <br/>
have DoTs. Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are not. Discussions of <br/>
Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt not to spoil <br/>
someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put spoiler space <br/>
(several blank lines) to let people know in advance. If you MUST post <br/>
something off-topic, please make it brief and put [OT] in the <br/>
header.  Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person doing so <br/>
will be immediately reviewed for warning, removal or banning. On a related <br/>
note, if you notice that your topic is straying from the original thread, <br/>
please change the subject header.<br/>
  Example: RE: Mistmoore Battle Drums becomes: re: Fighting undead as a <br/>
Bard (was RE: Mistmoore Battle Drums) For those of you receiving the digest <br/>
version, if you can make an attempt to change the subject field to <br/>
something appropriate, that would help those of us not digesting our mail <br/>
better pass it ;)<br/>
<br/>
2) No Flaming. Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please <br/>
be considerate of one another. Take a moment to read through, and then make <br/>
sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily. We&#39;re all <br/>
human, and no one likes to be called names. If you simply MUST insult, <br/>
badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>
<br/>
3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>
<br/>
4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s. KABONG! is an old list-term for a thread that is <br/>
being forcibly killed. This sometimes happens when a thread has degenerated <br/>
sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid for this list, or when the <br/>
subject matter has become too inflammatory to be discussed.Kabongs <br/>
generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>
<br/>
5) No Attached Files! If you wish to share with us your latest picture, <br/>
some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply include a link within <br/>
your email to an appropriate place online. If you have no access to such, <br/>
email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post it for you, and <br/>
follow up to the list with the URL. Small infractions will probably be <br/>
overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our European readers who <br/>
have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>
<br/>
6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot; posts to a minimum, and <br/>
try not to quote more of the message than necessary (although you should <br/>
always make sure that the message you are sending is properly referenced, <br/>
so that people reading the messages out of order are not completely lost. <br/>
And try not to abbreviate too much, or use strange &quot;slang&quot; or <br/>
incomprehensible euphemisms. Plain, clear speech is much more effective, <br/>
and will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages... Also, use spoiler<br/>
headings and/or spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or weapon details.<br/>
<br/>
7) Remember that, according to Verant&#39;s new policy, anything you say can <br/>
(and apparently will) be held against you. Our email list is private as far <br/>
as posting privileges, but the archives are open for public viewing. So <br/>
please, if you have an active EQ account, don&#39;t send anything to this list <br/>
that&#39;s likely to get you banned.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough rules. Now for some Frequently Asked Questions!<br/>
<br/>
* * NEW * * Q: How do I unsubscribe?<br/>
A: All list controls are accessed by going to the Yahoogroups webpage <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/eqbards/)">http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/eqbards/)</a>. If you are unable to do that, <br/>
send an email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">eqbards-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
* * NEW * * Q: Are there any archives?<br/>
A: Yes - (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/eqbards/messages/)">http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/eqbards/messages/)</a><br/>
<br/>
Q: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, &quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;MM&quot;, &quot;GZ&quot; - <br/>
What do they all mean?!<br/>
A: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the EverQuest Glossary at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm</a> (shameless plug). <br/>
Briefly, those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to spells/effects <br/>
that do damage every few seconds for a while, instead of all at once), <br/>
&quot;Direct Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their damage at <br/>
once), &quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon, &quot;MM&quot; is Mistmoore, a <br/>
mid-to-high level zone near Lesser Faydark, and GZ is Geoffrey Zatkin, the<br/>
Verant Designer in charge of spell balance (and thus a frequently consulted <br/>
individual when it comes to our songs....)<br/>
<br/>
Q: What is &quot;twisting&quot; (or &quot;weaving,&quot; &quot;stacking,&quot; or &quot;harmonizing&quot;), and how <br/>
do I do it?<br/>
A: &quot;Twisting&quot; is the most common name (although much deprecated by those in <br/>
favour of more &quot;period&quot; terms) for singing multiple songs at once - or at <br/>
least making it seem that way. The short explanation is to stop one song <br/>
and immediately start another one, repeat as necessary. Since most song <br/>
effects have a duration of about 6 seconds, you have time to weave as many <br/>
as three (and I&#39;ve even heard tell of four!) songs at once before the first <br/>
wears off, gaining the effects from all of them at once. The long <br/>
explanation, complete with illustrations, can be found <br/>
here:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://users.erols.com/gww6e/eq/HOWTO-twist-bard-songs.html">http://users.erols.com/gww6e/eq/HOWTO-twist-bard-songs.html</a><br/>
(thanks Tork@Nameless).<br/>
<br/>
Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level? What does this song do?<br/>
A: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest Bard&#39;s Guild <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqbard.htm)">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqbard.htm)</a> has a list of spellsongs, <br/>
however, most people seem to prefer detailed statistics, so let me refer <br/>
you to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqsongs.com/">http://eqsongs.com/</a> (The Bardic Song Analysis page), compiled by <br/>
Rokenn Swiftsong (This site no longer appears to be active, however, I am <br/>
attempting to contact the author for permission to mirror it). Also, the <br/>
Soerbaird is a wonderful site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sok.org/soerbaird/,">http://www.sok.org/soerbaird/,</a> and the <br/>
Concert Hall seems to have a good collection of Bards posting on the <br/>
message boards: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/,">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/,</a> and the EQ Diva website <br/>
is a great new resource: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/">http://www.eqdiva.com/</a><br/>
(Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>
<br/>
Q: What do instruments do?<br/>
A: Some songs have associated instruments. Playing this instrument will <br/>
generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is also related to <br/>
your relative skill with the instrument. Also, instrument skill is <br/>
partially responsible for failure rate of related songs. To avoid missing <br/>
notes, even when singing, keep your instrument skills maxed out.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>
A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the world. <br/>
Arranged by Strings, Percussion, Brass, Wind, in apparent order of value.<br/>
<br/>
Lisera Lute (Unknown) Stringed instrument, used in quests. Not known if it <br/>
has any bonuses.<br/>
The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found on Mynthi Davissi in Mistmoore) <br/>
which has about a 5% improvement on stringed songs (only really noticeable <br/>
after 47th level).<br/>
The Gypsy Lute (different from the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, in that it <br/>
is for a specific quest), which has about a 5% improvement on stringed <br/>
songs (only really noticeable after 47th level), and +5% Magic Resistance. <br/>
It&#39;s found in the same area as the Lute of the Gypsy Princess (above), but <br/>
on the generic Gypsy Musicians.<br/>
Lyendlln&#39;s Lute (Found in the Siren&#39;s Grotto on an unknown mob) Stringed <br/>
instrument that adds +10 AC, +25 HP, and enhances stringed songs by about 20%.<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute (Found in the Plane of Hate on Maestro of <br/>
Rancor) which adds +9 DEX, +15 CHAR, +9 AGI. It also seems to add about 20% <br/>
to stringed songs. Also called the &quot;Maestro&#39;s Lute.&quot;<br/>
Lyran&#39;s Mystical Lute (Found in Veeshan&#39;s Peak on Silverwing) Stringed <br/>
instrument that adds +10 STR, +10 DEX, +10 INT, +15 CHA. It is unknown what <br/>
bonus, if any, it gives to Stringed songs.<br/>
Lute of the Howler (Found in Velketor&#39;s Labyrinth on Khelkar Icepaw) <br/>
Stringed instrument that can be held in the primary, while a weapon is <br/>
wielded in the off-hand. Appears to give about a 15% increase to stringed <br/>
songs. Has Effect: Illusion Werewolf (+100 attack, +30 STR, +40% Haste)<br/>
<br/>
Drums of the Beast (Found in Siren&#39;s Grotto on a Shimmering Spirit) <br/>
Percussion instrument which appears to have a permanent Enduring Breath <br/>
effect while held. It is unknown what bonus these drums give to percussion <br/>
songs (although it&#39;s rumoured to be VERY high). It can only be held in the <br/>
primary slot.<br/>
Mahlin&#39;s Mystical Bongo&#39;s (Given by Baenar Swiftsong in South Karana) <br/>
Percussion instrument - gives no statistic enhancements, but does appear to <br/>
give an 8% improvement for drummed songs. This is part of the Bard Epic <br/>
Quest, resulting in the Singing Short Sword.<br/>
The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found on Mynthi Davissi in Mistmoore) Percussion <br/>
instrument - which increases the effects of most drummed songs by about 15%.<br/>
Walrus Skin Drum (Found in Siren&#39;s Grotto on unknown mob) Percussion <br/>
instrument, which increases the effects of most drummed songs by about 23%.<br/>
Sharkskin Drums (Found in Kedge Keep on Coralyn Kelpmaiden) Percussion <br/>
instrument - which appear to increase effects of drummed songs by about 25%.<br/>
Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine (Earned via Quest in Firiona Vie) Percussion <br/>
instrument - which gives +5 INT, as well as adding 20% to drummed songs. <br/>
And, hey - it&#39;s NO DROP! (This is a good thing)<br/>
Selo&#39;s Drums of the March (Found on Nagafen in Nagafen&#39;s Lair) Percussion <br/>
instrument - which increases the effects of most drummed songs by 35%.<br/>
<br/>
Alluring Horn (Found on Quag Maelstrom in the Ocean of Tears) Brass <br/>
instrument - it appears to negatively impact songs. Don&#39;t use it! It&#39;s part <br/>
of the Bard Epic Quest, resulting in the Singing Short Sword.<br/>
Conch Shell Horn (Found in Velious, in the Siren&#39;s Grotto and Cobalt Scar <br/>
on Sirens) Brass instrument, appears to give about a 5% bonus to brass songs.<br/>
Immaculate Shell Horn (Found in Velious, in the Siren&#39;s Grotto and Cobalt <br/>
Scar on unknown mobs) Brass instrument which adds +15 CHA, but has a <br/>
penalty of -8 STR. It appears to have about a 15% bonus to Brass songs.<br/>
Denon&#39;s Horn of Dissonnance (Obtained through a Plane of Air quest - Bard <br/>
Test of Brass) Brass instrument, which adds +5 STR, +5 INT, +10 CHA, +50 <br/>
HP. It does not appear to give any increase to Brass songs, however, unlike <br/>
most instruments, you can wield a weapon while holding this one.<br/>
McVaxius&#39; Horn of War (Found on Lady Vox in Permafrost) Brass instrument, <br/>
which adds +9 INT, +9 DEX, +15 CHA and increases Brass song effects by 15%.<br/>
<br/>
Lianna&#39;s Flute (From Regis the Reverent, used in a Cleric quest) Wind <br/>
instrument - no known special effects.<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo (Found on Cazic Thule) is a wind instrument. Not <br/>
sure if it has any added effect.<br/>
The Unicorn Horn (found on Equestrielle in Lesser Faydark), acts as a <br/>
Greater Lightstone while held, as well as a wind instrument. It also has 5 <br/>
charges of Purge. It may have up to a 10% bonus on wind songs.<br/>
Faun Flute - (From Fauns and Faun Stewards in the Wakening Lands) Wind <br/>
Instrument that gives +6 CHA, but no other known bonuses.<br/>
Aglimente&#39;s Flute of Flight (Formerly obtained through a Plane of Air <br/>
quest) Wind Instrument that gives +4 STR and +2 INT, but it is unknown if <br/>
it adds any to wind instruments.<br/>
Flute of the Sacred Glade (Found on Prince Thirneg on the Plane of Growth) <br/>
Wind instrument that adds +4 WIS, +8 CHA and +10 vs Disease. It does not <br/>
appear to add any bonus to wind songs.<br/>
Minotaur Horns (Found on Minotaurs in Steamfont and the Gorge of King <br/>
Xorbb) *wind instruments* (not Brass) which appear to add about 15% to wind <br/>
songs. They are also easily found, and lighter than flutes.<br/>
Brahhm&#39;s Horn (Found in the Gorge of King Xorbb on a named Minotaur) Wind <br/>
Instrument - which is exactly like a minotaur horn, and adds 15% to wind songs.<br/>
Scorpion Pincer (Found on scorpions in the Field of Bone), which adds 15% <br/>
to wind songs, and has the appearance of a Minotaur Horn.<br/>
Broken Minotaur&#39;s Horn (from the Minotaur Lord in Steamfont) is a wind <br/>
instrument like regular minotaur horns, however, it is heavier and adds +10 <br/>
to SV. vs Poison, and it&#39;s No Drop!<br/>
Ervaj&#39;s Flute of Flight (Obtained through a Plane of Air Quest - Bard Test <br/>
of Pitch) Wind instrument which adds +8 STR, +10 STA, +5 INT, +10 CHA, and <br/>
enhances wind songs by 60%.<br/>
<br/>
* * * Note: The Lizard Scout Fifes (Found on Lizard Scouts in the Feerrot) <br/>
and the Froglok Escort Fifes (found on Froglok Couriers in the Swamp of No <br/>
Hope) are quest items, and not playable instruments.<br/>
<br/>
There are new instruments still being discovered, so if you find any <br/>
information, or have a correction to this list, PLEASE let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Q: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>
A: Weight and cost. Mandolins are lighter, but a little more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Q: What&#39;s with all these instrument parts I keep seeing? (Unfinished horn, <br/>
lute strings, mouthpiece, raw bamboo, etc.)<br/>
A: Nobody knows. Rumour has it, there was to have been another tradeskill: <br/>
&quot;Instrument making&quot;, but nothing has ever been confirmed. In the meantime, <br/>
don&#39;t accidentally buy an unfinished horn, because believe me, they just <br/>
don&#39;t play the same.<br/>
<br/>
Q: What ever happened to the Practice Lute and Small Brass Trumpet that <br/>
were supposed to be mid-level bard instruments?<br/>
A: These items were never added to the game, and they apologized for saying <br/>
that it was.<br/>
(Gordon Wrinn, October 10, 2000 on General Discussion Board)<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are there any good quests for a Bard?<br/>
A: Yes, there are many &quot;good&quot; quests for Bards, although much better ones <br/>
are found by completing other class-specific quests. Allakhazam&#39;s Quest <br/>
Spoiler Database is probably the single-most complete compendium of quests <br/>
there is - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest_search.html">http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest_search.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Q: Where IS Fabian???<br/>
A: He&#39;s in East Freeport in the Grub and Grogg Tavern by the docks. But <br/>
trust me - it&#39;s just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Q: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an instrument while <br/>
swinging a sword?<br/>
A: Unfortunately, no. While instruments are off-hand only items, they are <br/>
also considered two-handed. Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much more fun to bash <br/>
monsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>
<br/>
Q: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; level? Where should I <br/>
hunt at this level?<br/>
A: Okay - time to ask the list ;)<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; weapons especially for Bards?<br/>
A: Yes, while Bards can take advantage of many different weapons, there are <br/>
several known Bard-specific weapons in the world:<br/>
<br/>
Whistling Dagger (In the Mines of Nurga off of unknown mob) Piercing 6/25. <br/>
+1 AC.<br/>
Blade of Fiery Lamentations (In Kaesora off of Strathbone Runelord) <br/>
Piercing 5/18. Procs Fingers of Fire (AE 28 damage)<br/>
Sainy&#39;s Claw (In the City of Mist off of some Golem) Piercing 6/19. +10 AC, <br/>
+3 INT.<br/>
Sainy&#39;s Singing Dagger (In Temple of Droga from unknown mob) Piercing 7/22. <br/>
Procs Symphonic Harmony (Lowers mobs &quot;Hate&quot; to the Bard.)<br/>
Sionachie&#39;s Partisan (In Karnor&#39;s Castle from the Caller of Sathir) <br/>
Piercing 9/19. +2 INT, +6 CHA, +5 MR.<br/>

Harmonic Dagger (In Karnor&#39;s Castle off Drolvarg Warlord) Piercing 10/21. <br/>
Procs Tishan&#39;s Clash (55 damage, 4 second stun)<br/>
Harmonic Spear (Bard&#39;s Test of Harmony in the Plane of Air) Piercing <br/>
(Primary only) 10/21. +5 STR, +5 DEX, +5 CHA. Procs Chant of Battle - bugged.<br/>
Symphonic Saber (In Chardok off of multiple creatures?) 1H-Slash 11/23. +5 <br/>
INT, +10 CHA. Procs Symphonic Harmony (Lowers mobs &quot;Hate&quot; to the Bard.)<br/>
Melodious Truncheon (In Charasis off of Bile Sentinel) 1H-Blunt 11/23. <br/>
Procs(?) Melodious Befuddlement (Stun effect). Appears as a Lute.<br/>
Evensong (In the Plane of Hate off of the Maestro of Rancor) 1H-Blunt 11/25.<br/>
Six Note Blade (In the Plane of Hate off of the Maestro of Rancor) 1H-Slash <br/>
11/25.<br/>
Singing Short Sword (Epic Quest reward) 1H-Slash 16/26 +15 STR, +10 DEX, +5 <br/>
STA, +20 CHA, +100 HP, +10 to all SV. Procs Dance of the Blade (55% haste <br/>
+str +atk)<br/>
<br/>
Q: What kinds of armour should I look for, specifically made for Bards, and <br/>
what does it look like?<br/>
A: There are seven sets of Bard-specific armour. All use the plate-armour <br/>
graphic set. The number in parentheses after the armour is the suggested <br/>
level for acquiring (although with good guild help or twinking, earlier is <br/>
possible).<br/>
<br/>
Lambent Armour (20+), which is available through a series of quests in the <br/>
Temple of Solusek Ro is a deep, rich blue.<br/>
Imbrued Armour (46+), which comes from the Plane of Hate, is a strong gold.<br/>
Singing Steel(40+), found on various high-powered mobs in Old Sebilis and <br/>
Karnor&#39;s Castle in Kunark, is a sea-foam green. Singing Steel pieces also <br/>
have right-clickable effects associated with most of the pieces.<br/>
<br/>
In Velious, you can quest for two of the remaining four:<br/>
<br/>
Resonant (50+), another deep blue armour, which is quested for in Thurgadin;<br/>
Troubador (55+), which is quested for in Kael Drakkal, and originally came <br/>
in a teal guardian armour look, however, in a recent patch it was retinted <br/>
to a more burgundy shade.<br/>
Melodic (50+), which is found in the Plane of Growth, uses the guardian <br/>
armour look, and comes in shades of grey or silver.<br/>
High Sun / Twilight armour(55+) (they changed the name from High Sun to <br/>
Twilight) is dropped in Skyshrine. It used to use a yellow guardian armour <br/>
look, but when they changed it to Twilight armour, they changed the tint to <br/>
dark grey.<br/>
<br/>
Q: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>
A: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the screen you have 6 (or <br/>
more) empty boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it. This is the <br/>
&quot;hotkey&quot; box. Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your <br/>
keyboard, but you can reconfigure that through the options settings. Songs, <br/>
spells, the spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made <br/>
&quot;hotkeys&quot;. To create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want <br/>
and HOLD it down. After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and <br/>
attach itself to your pointer. Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the <br/>
appropriate hotkey slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey. Now, whenever you <br/>
press the associated hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or <br/>
action in that slot. Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in <br/>
your hotkey bank is simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap <br/>
items in combat.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>
A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General <br/>
inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work. Bag slots will NOT) into <br/>
your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with an <br/>
instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever. PRACTICE THIS <br/>
MANEUVER!!! You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at least once, and <br/>
more likely several times, so practice practice practice! And if you *do* <br/>
accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and <br/>
run like crazy. It also helps to set your drop item confirmation to &quot;ON&quot; - <br/>
so that you don&#39;t accidentally drop something valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff class&gt;?<br/>
A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, Master of None.&quot; This <br/>
means that, while we can do so many different things (sneak, dual wield, <br/>
pick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be masters in any of <br/>
them, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 for Forage and 75 <br/>
for Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be incredibly good at these <br/>
skills. Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana regeneration speed <br/>
for your party members?<br/>
A: No. Here - let me emphasize that: NO!!!!! What the Jig does is increase <br/>
the rate of Stamina Regeneration every six seconds and hence the display of <br/>
the Stamina, Health, and Mana bars to show this increase. Without the song <br/>
playing the bars are refreshed every eight seconds. The ultimate effect of <br/>
this is that the mana bar &quot;moves&quot; every six seconds instead of every eight <br/>
seconds so it APPEARS to be moving FASTER. In actuality - it is moving 75% <br/>
of the distance it would move if it waited the other two seconds. So bottom <br/>
line, it LOOKS like it is regenerating faster but it does not. If you don&#39;t <br/>
otherwise have a need to regenerate stamina, you are wasting a memorized <br/>
song slot.<br/>
Or you can just use GZ&#39;s short answer: &quot;Urban Myth - Jig only gives fatigue <br/>
back.&quot;<br/>
(Geoffrey Zatkin, Archmage of Norrath [And Verant Game-designer], November <br/>
18, 1999, in a letter to Rokenn Swiftsong)<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity)?<br/>
A: &quot;There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an icon <br/>
on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15 <br/>
seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - this <br/>
means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep the <br/>
song effect going indefinitely.<br/>
Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the <br/>
Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again. <br/>
Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it <br/>
does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your screen.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Additionally, Absor confirmed that Kendrick (one of the programmers) said this:<br/>
&quot;Chorus of Clarity is not actually a buff. To equate it to a hitpoint <br/>
spell, it&#39;s similar to, say Healing, whereas Soothing is more like <br/>
Regeneration. CoC gives the recipients a direct shot of mana every time the <br/>
bard song pulses, unlike Soothing, which is basically a mana regen spell, <br/>
increasing the rate at which you regain mana.See the difference?&quot; (Absor <br/>
for Kendrick on the EQ Developer&#39;s Corner forum board - April 9, 2001)<br/>

Q: Does Shauri&#39;s Sonourous Clouding work against undead? Why does it work <br/>
sometimes and not others?<br/>
A: Shauri&#39;s Sonourous Clouding has been posited to work differently from <br/>
other invisibility effects in that it is level-based. It appears to work <br/>
against anything - but only if that thing is of a certain level or below. <br/>
This is still being hashed out, but the best solution is to con everything <br/>
you see while &quot;clouded.&quot; If it cons indifferent, you&#39;re invisible to it. <br/>
Otherwise, RUN!<br/>
<br/>
Q. Why can I never gain any experience in 2-handed slash or 2-handed blunt?<br/>
A. Although Bards have these skills, and even though they appear on the <br/>
trainer, you can never train 2-handed skills as a Bard. This is apparently <br/>
just something left over from Beta.<br/>
<br/>
Q. What are the most important stats as a Bard?<br/>
A. Well, because no matter what I answer, someone will disagree with me, I <br/>
will say this: No matter what your starting stats, odds are, you will <br/>
eventually be able to balance any deficiencies out with magic items and <br/>
jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
Q. What&#39;s the command for &lt;foo&gt;ing?<br/>
A. Well, I don&#39;t know how to foo (not sure that I want to) but there is a <br/>
nearly complete list of commands at (shameless plug one last time)<br/>

Okay, well, this FAQ is pretty long as it is - and I&#39;ve run out of <br/>
questions. If anyone has any suggestions for the next version, please feel <br/>
free to send them my way.<br/>
