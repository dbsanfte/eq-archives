<div id="ygrps-yiv-441720080">It lasts 9 seconds if not resisted. It works on any mob that is lower level<br/>
than you up to level 52. It&#39;s a very powerful song. The charm series is one<br/>
of the most powerful tools at our disposal. If you haven&#39;t purchased it, you<br/>
should.<br/>
<br/>
You chain cast it - mixing other songs in and fighting with weapons (after a<br/>
bit of practice and setting up your hotkeys) - recharming your pet after it<br/>
fades. <br/>
<br/>
Other practical uses:<br/>
<br/>
Pulling - works in alot of good ways. One that comes to mind is getting that<br/>
casting mob back to your group without it getting a spell off. Also, makes<br/>
it easy to pull mobs that deviate from following you and jump onto other<br/>
players or groups.<br/>
<br/>
Taunt - An almost sure-fire way to get a mob attacking you when you<br/>
absolutely need it too.<br/>
<br/>
Escape - charm, /pet guard here, run like mad. You&#39;ve got a 9 second head<br/>
start.<br/>
<br/>
KS&#39;ing - Mean old, anti-social wizard is being a bully? Charm the Ancient<br/>
Cyclops and watch him spend his mana blasting your immune pet.<br/>
<br/>
Crowd control on multiple pulls - charm a baddie and send it after another<br/>
that is not engaged by the group. Now you&#39;ve got two mobs tied up while the<br/>
group fights a third.<br/>
<br/>
Duels - nothing funnier than posting a screen shot of your buddy saying you<br/>
are his master.<br/>
<br/>
Kiting - charm that mob and let him do your dirty work for you, while you<br/>
run around burning wood or Lake Rathe way out ahead and safe.<br/>
<br/>
Save the crucial party members buttocks - Your enchi is going down and can&#39;t<br/>
get a mez to stick? Charm the baddie and give him some breathing room.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bravura question<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With Bravura&#39;s nerf a while back (due to someone charming Cazic Thule  lol!),<br/>
&gt; it seems to me that it would be, funadmentally, the same as Sirens. (I am 39<br/>
&gt; now, but have yet to go buy the damned thing, so I don&#39;t know it for sure, but<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t see VI making a bard song that lasts longer than 3 seconds)<br/>
&gt; If this is so, why are we still charged a mana cost for it?  If not, could<br/>
&gt; someone please explain the difference(s)  (aside from not having a level 37<br/>
&gt; cap ;p )<br/>
