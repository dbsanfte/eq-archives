&gt;donations at gates&quot;, and the sale of binds.  Verant does not want to do this<br/>
&gt;(In fact in the Policies and Procedures manual for Guides it forbids Guides<br/>
&gt;from binding players because it would &#39;damage the economy of players selling<br/>
&gt;binds&#39;).  NPCs binding would lower caster&#39;s value to the non-casters in<br/>
&gt;Norrath and eliminate a point of player interaction, Verant doesn&#39;t want that<br/>
&gt;either.  I&#39;ve got a 14th level Enchanter and I bind for free all the time even<br/>
&gt;though I could use the cash.  Why?  Because I like that feeling I get when<br/>
&gt;some 10th level player say &quot;Hey, thanks a lot!!&quot; when I turn down his 2gp that<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s trying to donate.  NPCs binding would eliminate that four thousands of<br/>
&gt;players.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that part of the economy is already broken.  I play a very poor gnome<br/>
enchanter (less than 1 plat most days because of trying to buy his 12th<br/>
level spells).  I sit near the gate in Freeport /shouting things like &quot;Poor<br/>
gnarled gnome binding for donations&quot;, while I meditate, which immediately<br/>
gets followed by someone else shouting &quot;Binding for free!&quot;  So, there is no<br/>
economy as long as people give things away or donations are not given.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bind anywhere?  Never happen.  In fact, I think the casters are probably lucky<br/>
&gt;to have gotten that ability, as it&#39;s potentially quite unbalancing when<br/>
&gt;fighting uber-mobs like dragons.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Potentially??<br/>
I&#39;m half-tempted to start posting false stories about how we &quot;camp Vox with<br/>
our kamikaze casters&quot; just to get Verant to see the illogic.<br/>
I&#39;m all for game fun, too, which is why, when I have that incredibly rare<br/>
opportunity to join a group, I jump on it, even though I&#39;m bound in Arena,<br/>
and the group is in Mistmoore.  Let me tell you, that was one long walk.<br/>
So was I supposed to abandon the group for who knows how long (this is 4am<br/>
EST, btw), hoping to get a bind closer?  If NPCs had bind, and I could go<br/>
there great.  They still wouldn&#39;t be able to bind me at (for example) the<br/>
lesser faydark zone point (like PC casters can).  The economy wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
broken.  Heck - once the first person gave it away for free, it already<br/>
was.  Do you guys remember when it was &quot;Binding for 2pp&quot; instead of<br/>
&quot;donations&quot;??  That&#39;s a case of the economy being broken by uncaring casters.<br/>
