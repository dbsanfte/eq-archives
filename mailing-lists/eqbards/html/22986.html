<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why did you start a Bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-889583371">My friend Gryffin gave me the game as a (months off hehe) birthday present.  He<br/>
and others were in Beta, and he thought I would like the game, and it would be<br/>
fun to have someone to talk with at work (we work together).<br/>
<br/>
It was my first on-line game, and really my first serious computer game at all.<br/>
<br/>
I have a real musical bent in RL, but no talent LOL, so a bard appealed to me. <br/>
None of the group I knew through my friend was a bard (they had a monk, cleric,<br/>
ranger, wizard, and druid) so a bard seemed a good choice.<br/>
<br/>
And then I found out how difficult playing a bard is, and that&#39;s really what<br/>
cemented it for me haha.  Plus all the lovely numbers and formulas and analysis<br/>
you could want (I am an engineer in real life *grin*).<br/>
<br/>
Nearly two years later he and I are still playing, and we still talk about EQ<br/>
nearly every day!<br/>
