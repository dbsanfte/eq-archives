<br/>
&quot;Saw Character No. 5 on [EQ Stratics], decided to send in my own parody <br/>
thats been sitting around for a while now.. its <br/>
called                         Whats my level again? To the tune of &quot;Whats <br/>
my age again?&quot; by Blink 182. Hope you enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
I logged on, it was a Friday night<br/>
I walked alone, into the starlit night<br/>
I started lagging bad, I got the packetloss<br/>
I got attacked by a griffenne<br/>
and thats about the time the server dumped me<br/>
I&#39;m always gonna be a newbie<br/>
and I&#39;m still amused by the pretty graphics<br/>
what the hell is DOT?<br/>
My friends say I should powergame<br/>
Whats my level again?<br/>
Whats my level again?<br/>
<br/>
Then later on, on the run back<br/>
I petitioned, to get my corpse back<br/>
I said it was a bug, that&#39;s what got me killed<br/>
Verant looks down on exploiting<br/>
and that&#39;s about the time he said To hell with me<br/>
I&#39;m always gonna be a newbie<br/>
why does everyone think I&#39;m duping?<br/>
what the hells an RPG?<br/>
My friends say I should powergame<br/>
What&#39;s my level again?<br/>
What&#39;s my level again?<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s about the time the server dumped me<br/>
I&#39;m always gonna be a newbie<br/>
and you still act like in the newbie grounds<br/>
what the hell is wrong with me?<br/>
My friends say I should powergame<br/>
What&#39;s my level again?<br/>
What&#39;s my level again?<br/>
<br/>
and that&#39;s about the time the GM banned me<br/>
No one should take a game so seriously<br/>
With many levels ahead to fall in line<br/>
Why would you wish that on me?<br/>
I never want to power game<br/>
What&#39;s my level again?<br/>
What&#39;s my level again?<br/>
