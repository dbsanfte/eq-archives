<div id="ygrps-yiv-504526323">Oh, the songs I could sing about the glories of lesser fay.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, I&#39;m not sure there is anywhere else you could rake in 50plat an<br/>
hour in the 10-15 lvl range - I did it, off those bandits....no, not the<br/>
sisters, the other camp - the one that really likes to drop bronze and<br/>
gems. Sisters aren&#39;t bad - and there is the quest for their necklaces<br/>
too....but they drop too much junk rust for my taste. The generic camp is<br/>
my all time favorite place to take low level friends to train. Pull them<br/>
with chain - let my newbie friends beat on them all day long. If we have to<br/>
suffer bard hate - I figure I might as well put it to good use - they<br/>
SELDOM change targets.<br/>
<br/>
Then, there is always the pixie tower (now brownie outcasts have been added<br/>
there, no more picnics). Pixies are particularly annoying to me, maybe it&#39;s<br/>
that little noise they make when they die - anyway, they quite often drop<br/>
low level gemstones, and a backpackfull of those got my enchanter off to a<br/>
good start in her jewelcrafting. The harder pixies are casters - but good<br/>
to hunt for xp and plat if you don&#39;t mind screwing a few factions along the<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Behind that, is the fairie village - just beautiful. Higher levels hunt<br/>
there, I&#39;ve never wanted to harm a fairy.<br/>
<br/>
Brownies - I suggest not hunting at the brownie village unless you have a<br/>
REAL good, REAL high level group - those little shits are just nasty nasty.<br/>
Got a tell from a very old friend of mine one day - &#39;Can you help me find<br/>
my corpse&#39;.  Huh?  He was a 50th level cleric - what the heck killed him<br/>
here?  Brownies.<br/>
<br/>
Mummies and Skeles can be found at their tower.<br/>
<br/>
The fay drake runs outside MM are nice, I don&#39;t mess with them either,<br/>
butterflies are just too pretty. Did see the big daddy charm someone once<br/>
that wasn&#39;t pretty.<br/>
<br/>
There used to be a unicorn that could be seen regularly trotting between<br/>
the bandit camps - not seen it in forever tho, guess they took it out.<br/>
Breathtaking animal - it would often stop and watch us hunt, like it knew<br/>
what we were doing, then softly trot off.<br/>
<br/>
Almost dead center of the zone is the woodelf outpost - extremely<br/>
convienent to buy and sell without having to run to Felewith - and around<br/>
the corner from that is a lovely orc camp with a little something for<br/>
everyone. Low levels can hunt the cents - higher levels go there to hunt<br/>
the legionnaire/chief that spawns in the middle tent. The leggo&#39;s spawn<br/>
time is just about perfect for a full manna dump and med - and by the time<br/>
you are hunting him, none of the rest are gonna mess with ya. Nother orc<br/>
camp there too, nothing particularly noteworthy - except it seldom has<br/>
visitors.<br/>
<br/>
They have added a shadowed man camp - I steer well clear of that place.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of spiders for tailors.<br/>
<br/>
That zone is a rangers dream for named mobs - and they come in all levels<br/>
and flavors. Brownie, pixie, fairy, wasp, spider.<br/>
<br/>
And best of all - folks think it&#39;s an empty zone - just the way to get to<br/>
Mistmoore, muhahahaha.<br/>

&gt;Most of the ppl I see in lesser faydark are sitting outside of mistmoor <br/>
&gt;having zoned. Couple groups doing bandits usually at any time, maybe a <br/>
&gt;brownie group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The distance to run from Steamfont to Freater Gaydark is not nearly as long <br/>
&gt;as W Commons to RV or Highpass. Lesser Faydark is not nearly as high traffic <br/>
&gt;an area as Kithicor is considering Kith is the main path most non-gaters <br/>
&gt;take to get from FP to Qeynos and back.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I hate what they&#39;ve done to Kithicor. I personally don&#39;t mind the mobs as a<br/>
&gt;&gt;50th, but I made the mistake of going afk at RV zone with my druid and<br/>
&gt;&gt;someone trained 4 or 5 uber-skellies there. Luckily I got back in time to<br/>
&gt;&gt;zone. It&#39;s the location. They should&#39;ve put these mobs somewhere else like<br/>
&gt;&gt;in Lesser Faydark. I feel sorry for halfling newbies that don&#39;t have <br/>
&gt;&gt;friends<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Lesser Faydark?  You gotta be kidding, then Gnomes would have no way out of<br/>
&gt;&gt;Steamfont.  That&#39;d be far worse as Lesser Fay has always had 5-10 times as<br/>
&gt;&gt;many people in it as Kithicor.  Not to mention there have always been some<br/>
&gt;&gt;undead in Kithicor so it fits the storyline far better there.<br/>
