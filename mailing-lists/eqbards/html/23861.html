<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603269655">Playing multiples is more challenging and there are some classes and<br/>
situations where it probabvly isn&#39;t a good idea. It is fairly common for my<br/>
cleric to play himself and me (bard) when I go to bed early on weeknights.<br/>
This is after we&#39;ve gotten to the room we&#39;re going to work out of and things<br/>
are reasonably routine. Macros are probably the single best reason we can<br/>
pull this off with as much success as we do. I have song macros setup and so<br/>
we&#39;ll load my account on the extra pc that is closer to him so that both his<br/>
keyboard and that one&#39;s are right there close and he doesn&#39;t have to reach<br/>
across the room. He uses me to melee or mana battery as the situation<br/>
demands. We&#39;ve had a friend with the same situation play his enchanter and<br/>
robo his mage. Typically we do this a)because we can&#39;t find the class we<br/>
need for a particular area, b)we&#39;re gotten in somewhere deep, gotten setup,<br/>
andnow it&#39;s time for me to go to bed (weeknights) and they want to stay for<br/>
another hour or 2. Not enough time to get a replacement in whereever and<br/>
that&#39;s always got some risk involved as well. Our groupmates know what&#39;s<br/>
going on and the group has input into whether it&#39;s ok or whether the place<br/>
we&#39;re in is too dangerous.<br/>
When we play 3 characters between us, its the 55 cleric for buffs and heals,<br/>
the 38 necro, and the 35 wiz. The necro and wiz are in the same group with<br/>
our friends similar level characters and the cleric just is there to save<br/>
all our butts. He plays the nec: put on dots and get the pet on the mob and<br/>
I play the wiz. Both these chars need med time so we rarely feel pushed,<br/>
especially since one friend&#39;s twink is an enchanter. The wizard typically<br/>
has to wait til the mob is down by 1/3 to 1/2 life before casting, (unless<br/>
I&#39;m fm and using stuns) so that&#39;s time to get the nec&#39;s dots on and pet<br/>
engaged. I will say I find wizarding a tad boring after being a bard and<br/>
having tons of options. With 2 characters in the group we both watch<br/>
everyone&#39;s hp and either of us can reach the cleric pc to launch a heal.<br/>
We&#39;ve been owning areas in Kaesora this way; that is a great place for exp<br/>
in the 30s.<br/>

Was in Hate recently, Maestro dropped Evensong and hand for warrior quest,<br/>
no lute again! I&#39;m cursed! No Imbrued dropped all day either. My 1H Blunt is<br/>
now 18; other bard said he had an Evensong already.<br/>
