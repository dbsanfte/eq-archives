&gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to have to agree Everquest is a game for<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who have lots of time on their hands. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; something the casual player is going to have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; either accept or move on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is your point? That people that don&#39;t spend a<br/>
&gt; lot of time in EQ should move on? I know people that<br/>
&gt; only play one hour every other day and have a great<br/>
&gt; amount of fun.<br/>
<br/>

complaining about the binding issue then.<br/>
