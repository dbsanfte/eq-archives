<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757035720">I suspect there will still be one song per level ..... minus the songs to<br/>
add growth ( wee with sarcasm )<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the time to help the developers get creative and offer up<br/>
suggestions for songs and help control are own destiny<br/>
<br/>
The more realistic the song ( an uber invoice see invis all in one song<br/>
would not be unbalancing ) the better the chance some developer will take<br/>
credit for it and we will get it<br/>
<br/>
I suspect thoughts like a non mana 1000 hit per tic dot would not be<br/>
considered. But what the heck who knows what a level 80 mob will be like<br/>

&gt;&gt; Why are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 49?<br/>
&gt;&gt; When we was finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave some room for<br/>
&gt;&gt; expansion during the evolution of EverQuest. Because Bards get one song<br/>
&gt;per<br/>
&gt;&gt; level, if we had given them all fifty songs there would have been no room<br/>
&gt;&gt; for expansion - aside from taking away older songs.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Expect to see new songs coming soon. These songs will not be anything<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; radically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions that help<br/>
&gt;&gt; keep the Bard interesting at high levels.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks Geoffrey!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So does this mean they are NOT going to have new songs for the levels over<br/>
&gt;50??? That seems odd to me if it is the case.<br/>
