<div id="ygrps-yiv-16843661">Ok, here is some information I have collected recently that may be of intrest to some of you more quest/lore oriented bards out there.  I hope we can get some discussion going on these topics.<br/>
<br/>
While I was hanging around in the Seafarer&#39;s Roost in East Freeport, the bard there did some performances.....  here we go:<br/>
<br/>
Palana Willin says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Within my head and inside my brain, I hold the power to set free Ogguk city.  Open up it&#39;s doors to all that is pretty.  Instead, here I am in a pile of my own dung smelling quite dingy.  Drinking Ogre Swill with which i am stingy.  I may have the key, but the point is quite moot.  For you see, I am nothing more than a dumb, smelly Ogre brute.  Thank you, I hope you enjoyed that one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Talym Shoonstar says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ha! That&#39;s right.  Them Ogre&#39;s are as thick as they come.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Palana Willin says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My city is mighty and all shall learn to cower.  We are nothing more than the ultimate power.  My city is pure and filled with beautiful charm.  I shall conquer you to save you from harm.  My city shall first send it&#39;s guards to back you in times of need.  Soon you shall learn to live under my laws, indeed.  So now down when you see me and give out my favorite cheer, All Hail Antonius Bail, my city is Qeynos and there is nothing to fear.<br/>
<br/>
Taylm Shoonstar says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Antonius Bayle is a blithering fool&quot;<br/>
<br/>
**NOTE** Palana refers to Antonius Bail, while Taylm refers to Antonius Bayle.  (Reminds me of princess Lenya/Lenia in Highkeep)<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Ok, in my screenshot I missed some of this one, but I can tell you this, she is singing about Joffrey Clay.<br/>
<br/>
Palana Willin says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...You took the lute.  It was my favorite one.  A little white lute, and went off to Qeynos.  You took the songs.  They were all special ones.  Packed them all up.  Off to Qeynos.  You killed the plant.  Put in a deep freeze.  Dumped it in the trunk.  With the rest of the refuse.  You, left to Qeynos.  You, left to Qeynos.  You, left to Qeynos.  You, left to Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Biggle Lobokker says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That voice must have scared him away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Talym Shoonstar says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Get off the stage lass.  Can&#39;t ye see he left becase you can&#39;t carry a tune.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
Those are the three songs I heard.  I went to see Joffrey Clay in the bard&#39;s guild in Qeynos, but I couldn&#39;t get him to say anything about Palina, or a lute, white, little, or otherwise.  Or special songs, a plant, a deep freeze, etc.  But then again, the more minds on that the better.<br/>
<br/>
Something else intresting I talked to Joffrey Clay about was the brought on by his opening statement after hailing him.  He said .... and I am trying to learn to play the [flute].  So I asked him &quot;What about the flute?&quot;  And he said something like &quot;Do you like my flute, Jusean made it for me&quot;, so I say &quot;Who is Jusean?&quot; and he says (paraphrase) &quot;Jusean is blah blah, his father was a master instrument crafter, and Jusean has taking up the technique quite well&quot;, so I say &quot;Where is Jusean?&quot; and Joffrey says he is close by.  Well, it turns out  Jusean is right outside the door, he is the guy who gives you the bard report quest.  I intergated him about being a instrument craftsman with no results.  I tried giving him instrument parts in various combinations (there are 2 places in Qeynos to get instrument parts, a merchant in the guild sells some and the guy on the dock also does, and  they DO NOT sell completely the same parts, either.) to no avail.  For  example, I have him an unfinished brass trumpet, Horn mouthpiece, and Trumpet Vales.  Then I gave him the same thing, and some money.  Tried Raw Bamboo and Flute mouthpiece, nothing... etc etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope this sparks some new discussion and maybe something will come out of this.  All I ask from you guys is that you share any info you find with the other bards who read this site/mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mr. Pink</div>
