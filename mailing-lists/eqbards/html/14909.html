<div id="ygrps-yiv-258234399"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 39: Invis to Undead (useful in Lower guk etc)<br/>
&gt; Level 45: An upgraded Bellow/DD song (giving us better combat skills)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These two I like.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Level 47: Summon Corpse song (like the necro one)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they see this as a necro-only ability.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Level 49: Upgraded older song (such as charm) or a combo song (2 effects<br/>
&gt; such as hymm and clarity)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since I dont have half the songs yet (I am closing in on 20, don&#39;t have<br/>
the lvl 3 song, so 18 total), I don&#39;t know what we would need at these<br/>
higher levels, but I think an AOE stun would be pretty sweet for the<br/>
high level, maybe even make it mana dependent.  The higher lvl charm<br/>
would be a definite plus...<br/>
