<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583305049"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; False alarm folks.  I got an email from Mike/Shada that he<br/>
&gt; tried it and it didn&#39;t work.  He asked someone who had the<br/>
&gt; sword, and he said that wasn&#39;t the way to get it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a quest, entirely contained within Mistmoore to get the sword. It<br/>
has been there for a long time and I know people have gotten it that way.<br/>
In fact, they made it tougher more recently by making the drops<br/>
infrequent.<br/>
<br/>
However, since the places I&#39;ve seen the Grimrot version posted are fairly<br/>
reputable, I was hoping that maybe there were two ways to get the<br/>
wakizashi.<br/>
<br/>
But.. well, if he had a dark elf SK had the lute to Grimrot and nothing<br/>
happened, guess that&#39;d confirm that. Sometimes you can get the same item<br/>
multiple ways though (for example, ogre war maul. go to najena or quest<br/>
for it).<br/>
