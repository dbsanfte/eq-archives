&gt;I&#39;ve been noticing this in Highpass fighting orcs.<br/>
&gt;We&#39;re all attacking the same mob, so I Lullbay them. (if we get a massive<br/>
&gt;spawn).  I count the nods, and sure enough, all the mobs are lulled.<br/>
&gt;Obviously the one we&#39;re attackig doesn&#39;t stay lulled, but neither do some<br/>
&gt;other ones, even though they&#39;ve got the nod message showing them as being<br/>
&gt;sleeping, and keep getting it displayed.  No one is attacking them either,<br/>
&gt;no AE spells, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Frustrating, to say the least.  Reduces my crowd control ability immensely.<br/>

days ago.  Same as you I nodded them all, but several kept right on<br/>
attacking.  Our enchanter after seeing this twice exclaimed, &quot;Hold on I&#39;ll<br/>
area mez them, haven&#39;t they fixed that damn bard song yet?&quot;  To which I<br/>
promptly /rofl&#39;d.  I added &quot;Don&#39;t worry, when they do it&#39;ll probably be:<br/>
<br/>
	A gnoll soothsayer nods to sleep<br/>
	a gnoll soothsayer says &quot;Its wood elves like you that ruined your<br/>
own lands, 						 you&#39;ll not ruin<br/>
mine!&quot;<br/>
	a gnoll soothsayer nods in agreement<br/>
	a gnoll brawler nods in agreement<br/>
	a volunteer Delyn_00 nods in agreement<br/>
<br/>
Doh!<br/>
