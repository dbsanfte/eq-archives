&gt;So I assume Gordon is referring to the level 47 song Niv&#39;s Melody of<br/>
&gt;Preservation when he says go visit your song vendors?  Any found this yet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also I have been wanting to get a hero bracer for months and I read that it<br/>
&gt;is possible you have to kill meldrath and his two mino guards to get the<br/>
&gt;hero to spawn, is this true?  I have spent a great deal of time running<br/>
&gt;around the gears killing potential placeholders but have never gotten him <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;spawn.  Additionally, I have read the hero is level 35 - does anyone think<br/>
&gt;it is possible to solo him at level 40 or does he hit like a giant?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Questions question...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation can be found in Kelethin.  In my younger days I <br/>
did a lot of hunting in Steamfont.  The Mino Hero popped all too frequently <br/>
and no one was hunting Meldrath or his guards.  My guess the Hero is a <br/>
standard rare spawn and you just have to kill all the trash around the gears <br/>
to get him to spawn.<br/>
