<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893587620">One thing I find ridiculous - I believe that a lot of our &quot;nerfs&quot; came about<br/>
because of other players complaining about bards being too powerful.  The<br/>
mana component of the higher-level charm song for example - came when (IIRC)<br/>
a Druid started ranting about bards taking all the Giants in Rathe Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed now more and more Druids doing the &quot;Quad Kiting&quot; tactic - of<br/>
kiting 4 mobs at once.  Whets unbalanced for a bard is perfectly acceptable<br/>
for a Druid...<br/>
<br/>
Ranting once again<br/>
