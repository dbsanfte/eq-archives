&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re applying single-player game mentalities to a<br/>
&gt; multi-player game.  Spawns that give things like rubicite are<br/>
&gt; a limited resource.  If someone uses his high level character<br/>
&gt; to get equipment like that for his low level characters, he is<br/>
&gt; depriving others of the chance to get that item, thus<br/>
&gt; increasing the camping problem on that spawn.  It is not<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what if that person that retired their main character, who got that<br/>
rubicite? Should they just delete that character and lose the rubicite?<br/>
How are they depriving anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s quite clear that simply twinking a character and CAMPING for<br/>
items to twink another char are quite different. <br/>
<br/>
I had a ranger with two polished granite tomahawks (both ripped from gnoll<br/>
paws before everyone heard about them). I retired this character<br/>
eventually. I don&#39;t play my ranger anymore. Should I just throw all this<br/>
away? <br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t automatically associate all the evils of camping rares to<br/>
twink newbies with simply twinking.<br/>
