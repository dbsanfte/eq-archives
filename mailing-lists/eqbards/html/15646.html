<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-351552786">Conventional tactics in EQ when you pull multiple mobs is for everyone to<br/>
/assist the main tank and take out the mobs one by one.  This stategy behind<br/>
this is that it will reduce the amount of damage inflicted on the entire<br/>
party.  I think it would be safe for me to say that almost every group I<br/>
join follows this tactic when we fight.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with this tactic is that, due to bard hate, it opens up the bard<br/>
to bear the brunt of the damage from the mobs that aren&#39;t engaged.  This<br/>
tactic also puts the groups healer at risk because unengaged mobs are likely<br/>
to attack him as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I wondering that if in situations where you get 2+ mobs, that it might<br/>
actually be smarter if the tanks in the group each attacked a different mob.<br/>
It would take longer to kill all the mobs, but it would help ensure that<br/>
damage to the group was spread out better.  Plus, if all the mobs are<br/>
engaged, it would be safer for bards to sing Largos to debuff mob attack<br/>
speed.  Its quite possible that the damage multiple mobs inflict using this<br/>
tactic (Largos in effect all the time) would be very close to the damage<br/>
they inflict when everyone focuses on one at a time. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had a lot of experience fighting in groups that followed the<br/>
second line of reasoning?  I&#39;d like to hear what your results were.<br/>
