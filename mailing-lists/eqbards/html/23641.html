<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Loot for secondaries (was: Eldrig the Old) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-456584859">I actually have no problem with a person claiming class-specific loot for<br/>
their secondaries...so long as they forgo the same for their primaries. <br/>
So long as they are only laying claim to one class&#39; loot, I see no<br/>
problem switching the two.  Now, if their secondary has the same class as<br/>
another member of the group, the actual member should obviously have<br/>
priority in that class&#39; drops.  Then again, my luck has only ever had one<br/>
piece of bard-only loot drop in a group I have been in, so I have never<br/>
had the chance to be robbed :)<br/>
