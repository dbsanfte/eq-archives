<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912368465">I just recently grouped up with a level 33 Druid, in order to have her<br/>
Gate me to commons (God damn I love high level druids) and she cast SoW<br/>
on me. WOW, I think superman is the one word for it. Previously, the two<br/>
would not stack and I&quot;d run slow, now with a drum, selo&#39;s and SoW I was<br/>
insanely fast. I then had a shaman cast something like Quickness on me,<br/>
and let me tell you, it was almost like I was drunk, the world was<br/>
zoooooooomming by me so fast :)<br/>
<br/>
So all I can say, make friends with druids and shamans. They are your<br/>
friends :)<br/>
