<br/>
The best thing to do is get a &quot;regular group&quot; - find a group that will play<br/>
the same days, hours and times - then you can learn together instead of you<br/>
having to teach the group every time.  Other than that - there are many<br/>
morons out there. <br/>
<br/>
How are you trying to solo? Toe to toe melee?  If yes, you need to change<br/>
your tactics.  Bards have low HP compared to true tanks and mobs are getting<br/>
stronger while you stay about the same (ok you get more hp each level but<br/>
the mobs get more).  Use tatics where you damage them but prevent them from<br/>
damageing you.  Hit and run - stay just far enough away that you can damage<br/>
them but they cant get you.  Use magic songs for damage - Chords, Denon&#39;s &<br/>
Bellow.  And do not be in a hurry - it takes longer and you need to learn it<br/>
out side.<br/>
<br/>
You would be better off to have a same-level partner and the 2 of you kill<br/>
more mobs with less downtime.  From 15 thru 25 - most other classes get<br/>
arrogant and ignore the need and value of partys.<br/>
<br/>
Get a better weapon - soon you will have dual wield.  The whip is ok but<br/>
there is better - Dragoon Dirk or Combine Longsword.  I used a giant snake<br/>
fang and mino axe along with my combine long sword for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
You lose hp when monster hits you - don&#39;t let him get close enough to hit<br/>
you - as much. Hit him, run, hit him , run.  Use songs to hit him!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

	Hi all<br/>
<br/>
	When I play EQ I allways get asked to play the Jig to increase mana<br/>
	regeneration. I was asked this for 4 times today and I really hate<br/>
it. I<br/>
	even got kicked from a group when I refused to play it because the<br/>
mana is<br/>
	not regenerating faster. Can anyone recommend me what to do?<br/>
	I have one more problem. I&#39;m lvl 15 at the moment and I can hardly<br/>
ever solo<br/>
	a blue creature. I&#39;m wearing full banded armor, and I have my 1H<br/>
slash<br/>
	allways maxed. I&#39;m using tentacle whip as a weapon, no it&#39;s not<br/>
twinked I<br/>
	got it as in a bet when someone didn&#39;t beleive me that selo&#39;s is<br/>
faster than<br/>
	sow. And I just bought the armor. Can anyone please tell me why<br/>
can&#39;t I solo<br/>
	a blue creature without loosing 90-95% of my health.<br/>
