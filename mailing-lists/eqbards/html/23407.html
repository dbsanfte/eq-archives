Bah!  I&#39;m the list newbie and refuse to give up the title!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
At level 10 I wouldn&#39;t advise all-instruments.  At level 12, try Hymn, CoD,<br/>
and Bellow with a mandolin.  It took me a while before this became a more<br/>
lethal combo than Hymn, Warsong, and CoD, but by level 13 it&#39;s a very safe<br/>
way to solo and much, much, much more effective against multiple mobs.<br/>
<br/>
I was soloing two or three blue mobs at a time just recently and found I<br/>
could start a battle at 3 and a half bubbles of health and end the battle<br/>
at nearly full health.<br/>
