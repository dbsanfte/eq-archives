<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995069983">Heh, don&#39;t misconstrue my email as a flame.  I certainly have nothing<br/>
personal against you or any other 50th level character.  I&#39;m simply<br/>
debating the philosophy behind playing a level 50 character, and whether<br/>
Verant really ever intended people to play maxxed out characters for very<br/>
long.  I merely assert that it may be time for Shada (not you, but Shada)<br/>
to go into the hallowed halls of the legendary bards that achieved that<br/>
pinnacle of power.  If you&#39;ve gotten all the spiffy items, and done all the<br/>
spiffy quests in the game, what&#39;s the point?  Roleplaying?  Sure, but that<br/>
can be done with ANY level character.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, it would be great if they raised the level cap and came up with a<br/>
bunch more zones for &gt;= 50th level characters, but not at the expense of<br/>
all the people that aren&#39;t that high.  We ALL knew there was a level 50 cap<br/>
when we started this game, so we can&#39;t use the &quot;we&#39;re paying for this<br/>
service&quot; argument.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, this isn&#39;t particularly bard specific.  So I&#39;ll leave the<br/>
discussion at that.<br/>

&gt;well excuuuuuuuuse me =P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;that is what the planes are for.  when Fear was open (yes it is open now but<br/>
&gt;impossible for 40 level 50s) a large majority of 45+ characters was there<br/>
&gt;for most of their time, thus freeing up space for spots where they would<br/>
&gt;normally take away from the rest of the 40-50 characters.  it got us out of<br/>
&gt;your way.  it also kept me from creating new characters and going after<br/>
&gt;items for them (so sue me).  before they patched Fear and made it<br/>
&gt;impossible, i had no other characters.  now i have two.  like you said, the<br/>
&gt;vast majority of players are not 50, and consequently the vast majority of<br/>
&gt;zones are not for level 50 players.  as of now, there are really only 2<br/>
&gt;zones, which i mentioned: Solusek B and Lower Guk.  more zones for us is the<br/>
&gt;answer, not retirement.  thanks for wanting to get rid of me though =P<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I guess I really don&#39;t understand this.  Maybe I&#39;m incorrect <br/>
&gt;&gt; in assuming<br/>
&gt;&gt; that the whole point of EverQuest is the experience of <br/>
&gt;&gt; getting to level 50.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  There may be a few challenges left at level 50, but that&#39;s <br/>
&gt;&gt; not really what<br/>
&gt;&gt; the game is all about.  Once you reach 50, I don&#39;t really see <br/>
&gt;&gt; the point.<br/>
&gt;&gt; You&#39;ve won, essentially.  You&#39;ve become a demi-god, or <br/>
&gt;&gt; whatever.  If it was<br/>
&gt;&gt; a single player game, it would be over.  Why should Verant <br/>
&gt;&gt; have to generate<br/>
&gt;&gt; content for those that have maximized their characters, beyond the few<br/>
&gt;&gt; really tough encounters that should be the ultimate victories for said<br/>
&gt;&gt; characters?  Once you&#39;ve killed Nafagen, or Lady Vox, or <br/>
&gt;&gt; other Uber-mob,<br/>
&gt;&gt; shouldn&#39;t it be time to retire?  Obviously this stance would cause the<br/>
&gt;&gt; level 50 people to stop playing, and move on to other games, <br/>
&gt;&gt; but I think<br/>
&gt;&gt; that this is how it should be (unless they want to play as a different<br/>
&gt;&gt; character).  The VAST majority of players still haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt; reached 50, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; most aren&#39;t even close.  Verant can&#39;t make the game revolve around<br/>
&gt;&gt; powergamers, because they would never be able to keep up.  In <br/>
&gt;&gt; fact, I&#39;m for<br/>
&gt;&gt; putting level 50 characters into forced retirement until the expansion<br/>
&gt;&gt; pack.  That way we could get rid of all this farming for <br/>
&gt;&gt; guilds, and for<br/>
&gt;&gt; other twinked characters.  Plus we&#39;d stop distracting the <br/>
&gt;&gt; developers from<br/>
&gt;&gt; fixing the real problems with the game.  In my opinion, lack <br/>
&gt;&gt; of things for<br/>
&gt;&gt; level 50 players to do is not an important problem in the game.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>
