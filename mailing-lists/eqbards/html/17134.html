<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195949427">Stop tanking for them.  Go solo for a few levels like I mentioned in my<br/>
other post.  Let them suffer without a tank.  Also the binding/run naked<br/>
issue is moot, after your cleric reaches 29th level.  It no longer matters<br/>
where you are bound when you have a rez capable cleric in the group.  I will<br/>
repeat for emphisis, You could be bound in Ak&#39;Anon and fighting in<br/>
Permafrost, if you have a cleric that can rez you.  Bind points do not<br/>
matter after you have a 29+ level cleric in your group.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d love to.  I&#39;ve tried.  Response is invariably, &quot;You think <br/>
&gt; we need a real<br/>
&gt; tank so bad, you start a warrior.&quot;  If these weren&#39;t friends <br/>
&gt; and cowrokers<br/>
&gt; in RL I&#39;d have quit EQ a long time ago.  No one is willing to <br/>
&gt; put up with<br/>
&gt; the run back after death and I don&#39;t blame them.  It is <br/>
&gt; ridiculous in the<br/>
&gt; extreme.  If everyone had to make the run, some people would <br/>
&gt; play melee<br/>
&gt; types.  Since there is a way to avoid the run, play a caster, <br/>
&gt; that is what<br/>
&gt; nearly everyone does.  Our guild has 3 bards, 1 monk, 1 SK, <br/>
&gt; and I think 1<br/>
&gt; paladin and 2 rangers.  Everyone else is a caster.  75% <br/>
&gt; casters.  Started<br/>
&gt; out about 30% casters but everyone playing a melee class quit <br/>
&gt; after about<br/>
&gt; 12th level or so and restarted as casters solely due to the <br/>
&gt; binding issue.<br/>

&gt; ouch, no wonder you are getting wacked.  Your group needs to <br/>
&gt; realize now,<br/>
&gt; instead of latter, that a real tank is a must.  Rangers are <br/>
&gt; good secondary<br/>
&gt; tanks, but are very bad at primary tanking.  Fortunatly is <br/>
&gt; seems your core<br/>
&gt; group is still low enough level where you can power up a real tank<br/>
&gt; (preferably a Warrior) up to your level range if you all work <br/>
&gt; together on<br/>
&gt; this.  Once your cleric hits 29 the run back is a moot point <br/>
&gt; as you will<br/>
&gt; just get a revive.  But please do yourself and your group of <br/>
&gt; friends a favor<br/>
&gt; and convince one of them to start a warrior, otherwise all of <br/>
&gt; you will be<br/>
&gt; feeling the pain in a serious way in another 5-6 levels.   <br/>
&gt; Trust me on this<br/>
&gt; my orginal guild kind of fell apart due to the lack of any <br/>
&gt; real tanks (lots<br/>
&gt; of rangers though).  And the eventually the level split in <br/>
&gt; the guild lead to<br/>
&gt; over recruiting, which always leads to a guild in crisis.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I agree on the cleric, but unfortunately we only have two <br/>
&gt; &gt; around my level<br/>
&gt; &gt; and one is a butt-head.  Generally the pullers bring back 1-3 <br/>
&gt; &gt; mobs which<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t too bad.  Occasionally mobs will spawn in the spots <br/>
&gt; &gt; they bring the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pull back thru which leads to the bad pulls.  I have tried <br/>
&gt; &gt; pulling but with<br/>
&gt; &gt; no speed running and the pulling distances what they are in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sol A generally<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am usually down to a bubble or two when I get back to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; group.  I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; generally do a better job of splitting the mobs though ;-).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am the tank unfortunately.  Its just me, and another bard <br/>
&gt; generally.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Occasionally we have a ranger but that&#39;s it.  Our guild is <br/>
&gt; &gt; all made up of<br/>
&gt; &gt; fairly casual players and no one else is willing to put up <br/>
&gt; &gt; with 20+ minute<br/>
&gt; &gt; runs every time they die so they all quit their melee <br/>
&gt; &gt; characters some time<br/>
&gt; &gt; ago and play casters now.  Our entire guild has about 30 <br/>
&gt; &gt; members I think.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Less than a third are non-casters.  In truth I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; generally see anywhere<br/>
&gt; &gt; near as many non-casters in general.  The melee types I do <br/>
&gt; &gt; see are nearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; always either twinks or quickly level out of my range because <br/>
&gt; &gt; they play far<br/>
&gt; &gt; more time than I do.  Even our ranger remarked that he gave <br/>
&gt; &gt; up hitting the<br/>
&gt; &gt; taunt button if I was singing hymn.  It just didn&#39;t matter he <br/>
&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t taunt<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything off me after about 1 minute of fighting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Believe me, for Rp-ing reasons I want to pay my bard more <br/>
&gt; &gt; than any other<br/>
&gt; &gt; character.  This is the only list I even bother to read <br/>
&gt; &gt; anymore because it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is so far beyond the other&#39;s in terms of good tips, great <br/>
&gt; debates, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; generally fun people that I quit all the others.  I just <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t get to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; much fun playing my bard anymore.  I had one really great <br/>
&gt; &gt; nite in Sol A.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The next three times I went it was pretty bad.  The last <br/>
&gt; &gt; time, I got 1/2 a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bubble of experience in 3 hours.  I spent the entire time <br/>
&gt; &gt; running, dying,<br/>
&gt; &gt; running back to zone, fleeing some other groups train, <br/>
&gt; &gt; running from a bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; pull, etc.  I would have actually had minus xp for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; evening had I not<br/>
&gt; &gt; been resurrected by a passing 50th cleric on his way into Sol B.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately he got there at the same time I did, so xp was <br/>
&gt; &gt; the only thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; I saved.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When you get to play only 2 hours or less most times you sit <br/>
&gt; &gt; down, that 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; minute penalty for dying becomes quite huge.  The night I <br/>
&gt; &gt; died 3 times I got<br/>
&gt; &gt; to actually play for less than 30 minute.  the rest of my <br/>
&gt; &gt; time was spent<br/>
&gt; &gt; running back to my corpse.  Only one of those deaths was <br/>
&gt; &gt; avoidable, the rest<br/>
&gt; &gt; were the result of being trained by another group or lone wolf.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Kit, <br/>
&gt; &gt; If I ever met a cleric with an attidude like that (ie let <br/>
&gt; &gt; some one die to<br/>
&gt; &gt; prove a point) I would quickly add him/her to my no group <br/>
&gt; &gt; list.  It sound to<br/>
&gt; &gt; me you need to teach the pullers in your groups that <br/>
&gt; pulling does not<br/>
&gt; &gt; meaning bringing a train of 4-6 mobs back to the group.  If <br/>
&gt; &gt; they can&#39;t do it<br/>
&gt; &gt; I suggest you take over the pulling duties and show them how <br/>
&gt; &gt; it is done.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Rokenn<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PS Also you may want to teach the &#39;tanks&#39; to hit the tuant button :)<br/>
