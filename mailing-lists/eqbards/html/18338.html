Subject: [eqbards] ILOVEYOU! Virus warning<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; /ooc A rapidly spreading virus is sweeping across the world at an alarming<br/>
rate.<br/>
&gt; It has the subject &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; and contains an attachment &quot;A Love Letter<br/>
For You&quot;.  This attachment contains a Visual Basic virus which will do the<br/>
following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Re-direct you IE homepage to www.skyinet.com<br/>
&gt; Overwrite your .jpg, .css, .vbs, .mpg, .mp3 (amongst others) files and<br/>
give them a .vbs extension. It is suspected that the virus will append<br/>
itself to these files also.<br/>
&gt; Propogate to all your contacts in your Outlook contacts list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Several UK and European companies have been brought down by this virus,<br/>
which is spreading faster than the Melissa virus of last year.  It also hit<br/>
our company a short while ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Delete any mail with the subject &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; and certainly do not open<br/>
any attachments it may contain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Symantec have very recently released an update to their software to combat<br/>
the virus, although their homepage is currently swamped ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know people don&#39;t usually trust anti-virus mails, but this is not a<br/>
drill ;)  Check out the news pages of www.yahoo.co.uk or www.zdnet.com for<br/>
details.<br/>
