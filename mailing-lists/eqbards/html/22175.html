Excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
GrollerDaBard: My expectation, especially in a class based situation, would be at least ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE for EVERY CLASS.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very obvious that no matter how hard you, Absor, or any other person tries, they cannot know everything about every class. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Abashi: That&#39;s certainly a fact, and your assertion has merit. Can we agree though that no matter how much someone knows about a class that they are likely to want things for that class that are in conflict with something wanted by <br/>
another? It doesn&#39;t take an intimate knowledge of every class to know that will not work out. <br/>
<br/>
We have resources here. In fact today we had one of our own in-house &#39;crazy bard&#39; (by crazy I mean every bit as much of a passionate player as anyone else) up in the development area all day going over issues with the class. We got a <br/>
lot of useful information out of it, of course at the same time we got suggestions that would be in conflict with the game as a whole. <br/>
<br/>
GrollerDaBard: Let&#39;s take Bards for instance (just cause I follow their issues more then other classes) I know Bards would be ecstatic to have a single person who is there only to respond to their issues. <br/>
<br/>
Abashi: A posting representative of every class however is not something that we&#39;d do. Keep in mind that we have to try and speak in a unified voice, and that cannot be done if we have 14 class-reps out here all posting their thoughts. <br/>
