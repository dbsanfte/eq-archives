<div id="ygrps-yiv-773950250">My experience wih procing is based on my Staff of Wiggling and Obscene<br/>
Shard.  My guess is that dex much under 100 is considered sub standard -<br/>
over & close 100 about &#39;normal&#39; - near or over 120 &#39;above average&#39; and above<br/>
that probably only marginally better.  I think that there are &quot;break points&quot;<br/>
where if you get past them you see better results but that the result curve<br/>
is not strictly linear. <br/>
<br/>
These are approximate numbers to illustrate the non-linear nature and point<br/>
of diminishing returns.  I have no scientific data to back this up. But he<br/>
point is - some good base dex to get you at or close to 100 combind with<br/>
some typical dex items to get you over 110 and maybe near to 120 should do<br/>
pretty well. If songs then take the party over 130ish and give them other<br/>
stats as well, you are doing prolly the best you can.  To overload on dex<br/>
items and buff over 140/150/160 prolly has marginal result and your<br/>
slots/pp/buffs might be better spent on other stuff.<br/>

Unless I&#39;m mistaken, Ykesha won&#39;t proc at all until level 38, so maybe proc<br/>
frequency has to do with level as well as dex. Dunno. Ain&#39;t gone one. Sure<br/>
ain&#39;t level 38 :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; If and when the Ykesha procs and is dependent upon your DEX. What<br/>
&gt; does your DEX need to be for it to proc well?  Mine is 135 right now. </span></blockquote></div>
