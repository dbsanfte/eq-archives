<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652408193"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; one that feels that way.  And I agree, when I get to those levels, I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; going to be annoyed that the game has gotten boring.  However, that does<br/>
&gt; not change my assertion, that when I get bored playing the game, I<br/>
&gt; will *stop* playing the game.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I forgot to mention one important thing that keeps me playing.<br/>
<br/>
  I like those large barbarian breasts; I don&#39;t get to see those<br/>
  when I&#39;m on irc.  Plus it helps to be dating one in-game.  I just<br/>
  invite her to the planes a lot, so I can see her nekkid more ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  That alone is worth 10 bux a month, I must note.  Although, if you&#39;d<br/>
  ask my girlfriend she&#39;d disagree.  Can&#39;t please everybody &lt;g&gt;<br/>
