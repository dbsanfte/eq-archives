<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647616957">Lunchtime I log on and ask a level 45 if she can help me get a quest item,<br/>
I join her group (2 x 45 Japanese) and we go off to the king room in Sol A<br/>
and start kicking ass (no exp) We killed a Sol mage (no Firewalker boots)<br/>
and we killed 2 Sol Champs (no Fiery Vambraces), and just as it was time<br/>
for me to log a Sol Champ spawns right in front of me and we kill it, and<br/>
what have we got? A rather nice item - Fiery Vambraces, AC 6 +5 Sv Fire<br/>
(looks like steel when worn), but most importantly it is the harder part of<br/>
my Lambent Vambraces Quest so I&#39;m absolutely delighted.<br/>
I just wished I could of stayed longer to get some Firewalker Boots too.<br/>
