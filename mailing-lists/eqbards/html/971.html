<b>Subject:</b> How in the world do you stack? I don&#39;t think stacking works at all . . . <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774816253">OK, someone clear thnigs up for me. There is endless discussion about<br/>
&quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing two songs<br/>
at once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some sort of<br/>
special trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves starting<br/>
one song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song and<br/>
quickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and then<br/>
stopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
	My only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>
<br/>
	Do people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing the<br/>
effect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of button<br/>
pressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have failed<br/>
entirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have the<br/>
icon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I hardly ever<br/>
actually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually higher<br/>
when I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any effect of<br/>
either song!<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over zealous but<br/>
very talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a lot of you<br/>
take seriously. <br/>
	<br/>
	I for one am going to save my fingers the busywork . . . <br/>
