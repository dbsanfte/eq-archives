<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067546912">he was lucky in that the npc he sold it to had lots of inexpensive items in<br/>
his inventory.  even at level 50, imagine having to buy loads and loads of<br/>
fine steel that sell for 5pp but you have to buy back for 60pp.  oh and he<br/>
was already that type of friend, and i was ecstatic that it worked and i was<br/>
able to help =)<br/>

&gt; Thats a great story Shada.  Bet you made a friend for life <br/>
&gt; with that tip.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would imagine that a lot of people have sold lambent stones <br/>
&gt; to the gypsies<br/>
&gt; in NK.  Nice to know that if I&#39;m having trouble finding a <br/>
&gt; giant hunting<br/>
&gt; party or someone selling a stone I can always try this <br/>
&gt; option.  Hard part<br/>
&gt; then would be picking the right gypsy:-)<br/>
