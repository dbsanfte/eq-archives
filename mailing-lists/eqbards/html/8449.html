<div id="ygrps-yiv-788089772">Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List, a mailing list <br/>
dedicated to all for and about the Bard in EverQuest.<br/>
This list will be posted semi-regularly, and updated as often as is needed. <br/>
If you have any suggestions, or any frequently asked questions, please let <br/>
me know.<br/>
<br/>
                  First, some basic rules:<br/>
                  (Common sense stuff, really)<br/>
<br/>
                  1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible).  While we do <br/>
often stray off the<br/>
                  path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the <br/>
material &quot;of-interest&quot; to<br/>
                  our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are <br/>
acceptable, because Bards<br/>
                  have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are <br/>
not.  Discussions of<br/>
                  Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt <br/>
not to spoil<br/>
                  someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put <br/>
spoiler space<br/>
                  (several blank lines) to let people know in advance.<br/>
                    Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person <br/>
doing so will be<br/>
                  immediately reviewed for warning, removal or banning.<br/>
                    On a related note, if you notice that your topic is <br/>
straying from the<br/>
                  original thread, please change the subject <br/>
header.  Example: RE: Mistmoore<br/>
                  Battle Drums becomes:<br/>
                  re: Fighting undead as a Bard (was RE: Mistmoore Battle <br/>
Drums)<br/>
                  For those of you receiving the digest version, if you can <br/>
make an attempt<br/>
                  to change the subject field to something appropriate, <br/>
that would help those<br/>
                  of us not digesting our mail better pass it ;)<br/>
<br/>
                  2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as <br/>
you do, but please<br/>
                  be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read <br/>
through, and then<br/>
                  make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting <br/>
hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>
                  all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you <br/>
simply MUST insult,<br/>
                  badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>
<br/>
                  3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>
<br/>
                  4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old list-term for <br/>
a thread that is<br/>
                  being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when a <br/>
thread has<br/>
                  degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid <br/>
for this list, or<br/>
                  when the subject matter has become too inflammatory to be <br/>
discussed.<br/>
                  Kabongs generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>
<br/>
                  5) No Attached Files!  If you wish to share with us your <br/>
latest picture,<br/>
                  some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply <br/>
include a link within<br/>
                  your email to an appropriate place online.  If you have <br/>
no access to such,<br/>
                  email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post <br/>
it for you, and<br/>
                  follow up to the list with the URL.  Small infractions <br/>
will probably be<br/>
                  overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our <br/>
European readers who<br/>
                  have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>
<br/>
                  6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot; posts <br/>
to a minimum, and<br/>
                  try not to quote more of the message than necessary <br/>
(although you should<br/>
                  always make sure that the message you are sending is <br/>
properly referenced,<br/>
                  so that people reading the messages out of order are not <br/>
completely lost.<br/>
                  And try not to abbreviate too much, or use strange &quot;slang&quot; or<br/>
                  incomprehensible euphemisms.  Plain, clear speech is much <br/>
more effective,<br/>
                  and will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages...  Also, use <br/>
spoiler headings and/or<br/>
                  spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or weapon details.<br/>
<br/>
                  Okay, enough rules.  Now for some Frequently Asked Questions!<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, <br/>
&quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;FBR&quot; - What<br/>
                  do they all mean?!<br/>
                  A: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the <br/>
EverQuest Glossary at<br/>
                  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm</a> <br/>
(shameless plug).  Briefly,<br/>
                  those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to <br/>
spells/effects that do<br/>
                  damage every few seconds for a while, instead of all at <br/>
once), &quot;Direct<br/>
                  Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their <br/>
damage at once),<br/>
                  &quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon, and &quot;Flowing <br/>
Black Robes&quot;<br/>
                  something casters love.<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level?  What does this <br/>
song do?<br/>
                  A: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest Bard&#39;s <br/>
Guild<br/>
                  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)</a> has a list <br/>
of spellsongs,<br/>
                  however, most people seem to prefer detailed statistics, <br/>
so let me refer<br/>
                  you to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/</a> - The Concert <br/>
Hall.  Also,<br/>
                  the Soerbaird is a wonderful site: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com/">http://www.soerbaird.com/</a><br/>
                  (Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: What do instruments do?<br/>
                  A: Some songs have associated instruments.  Playing this <br/>
instrument will<br/>
                  generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is <br/>
also related to<br/>
                  your relative skill with the instrument.  Also, <br/>
instrument skill is<br/>
                  partially responsible for failure rate of related <br/>
songs.  To avoid<br/>
                  &quot;fizzling&quot; (missing notes) even when singing, keep your <br/>
instrument skills<br/>
                  maxed out.<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>
                  A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in <br/>
the world.<br/>
                       The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found in Mistmoore), <br/>
which increases the<br/>
                  effects of most drummed songs by 20%<br/>
                       The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found in <br/>
Mistmoore) which has no<br/>
                  discernible special effect.<br/>
                       Brahm&#39;s Horn (found in the Gorge of King Grobb) <br/>
which has no known<br/>
                  discernible effect.<br/>
                       Drums of Selo&#39;s March (Found on Cazic Thule?) which <br/>
increases the<br/>
                  effects of most drummed songs by 30%.<br/>
                       McVaxius&#39; Horn of War (unknown) which adds +9 INT, <br/>
+9 DEX, +15 CHA and<br/>
                  increases Brass song effects by 15%.<br/>
                       Minotaur Horns found on minotaurs in Steamfont and <br/>
the Gorge of King<br/>
                  Grobb are wind instruments with no known special <br/>
effect.  They are,<br/>
                  however, lighter than flutes, and don&#39;t cause that awful <br/>
animation.<br/>
                       The Lizard Scout Fifes are rumoured to be <br/>
non-magical wind<br/>
                  instruments, but this still remains to be proven.<br/>
                       The Unicorn Horn (found in Lesser Faydark), acts as <br/>
a Greater<br/>
                  Lightstone while held, as well as a wind <br/>
instrument.  Other than that, it<br/>
                  has no discernible special effect.<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>
                  A: Weight and cost.  Mandolins are lighter, but a little <br/>
more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an <br/>
instrument while<br/>
                  swinging a sword?<br/>
                  A: Unfortunately, no.  While instruments are off-hand <br/>
only items, they are<br/>
                  also considered two-handed.  Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much <br/>
more fun to bash<br/>
                  monsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; <br/>
level?  Where should I<br/>
                  hunt at this level?<br/>
                  A: Okay - time to ask the list ;)<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>
                  A: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the <br/>
screen you have 6 empty<br/>
                  boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it.  This <br/>
is the &quot;hotkey&quot;<br/>
                  box.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on <br/>
your keyboard, but<br/>
                  you can reconfigure that through the options <br/>
settings.  Songs, spells, the<br/>
                  spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made <br/>
&quot;hotkeys&quot;. To<br/>
                  create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you <br/>
want and HOLD it<br/>
                  down.  After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; <br/>
and attach itself<br/>
                  to your pointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the <br/>
appropriate hotkey<br/>
                  slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you <br/>
press the associated<br/>
                  hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or action <br/>
in that slot.<br/>
                  Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your <br/>
hotkey bank is<br/>
                  simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap <br/>
items in combat.<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>
                  A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory <br/>
slots (General<br/>
                  inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag <br/>
slots will NOT) into<br/>
                  your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword <br/>
and swap it with an<br/>
                  instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or <br/>
whatever.  PRACTICE THIS<br/>
                  MANEUVER.  You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at <br/>
least once, and<br/>
                  more likely several times, so practice practice <br/>
practice!  And if you *do*<br/>
                  accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, <br/>
grab the item and<br/>
                  run like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
                  Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff <br/>
class&gt;?<br/>
                  A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, <br/>
Master of None.&quot; This<br/>
                  means that, while we can do so many different things <br/>
(sneak, dual wield,<br/>
                  pick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be <br/>
masters in any of<br/>
                  them, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 <br/>
for Forage and 75<br/>
                  for Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be <br/>
incredibly good at these<br/>
                  skills.  Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>
<br/>
                  Q:  Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana <br/>
regeneration<br/>
                  speed for your party members?<br/>
                  A: No.  What the Jig does is increase the rate <br/>
of  Stamina Regeneration<br/>
                  every six seconds and hence the display of the Stamina, <br/>
Health, and Mana<br/>
                  bars to show this increase.  Without the song playing the <br/>
bars are refreshed<br/>
                  every eight seconds.  The ultimate effect of this is that <br/>
the mana bar<br/>
                  &quot;moves&quot; every six seconds instead of every eight seconds <br/>
so it APPEARS to be<br/>
                  moving FASTER.  In actuality - it is moving 75% of the <br/>
distance it would<br/>
                  move if it waiting the other two seconds.  So bottom <br/>
line, it LOOKS like it<br/>
                  is regenerating faster but it does not.  If you don&#39;t <br/>
otherwise have a need<br/>
                  to regenerate stamina, you are wasting a memorized song slot.<br/>
<br/>
                  Q. Why can I never gain any experience in 2-handed slash <br/>
or 2-handed blunt?<br/>
                  A. Although Bards have these skills, and even though they <br/>
appear on the<br/>
                  trainer, you can never train 2-handed skills as a <br/>
Bard.  This is apparently<br/>
                  a piece of virtual duct-tape to allow GMs and Guides to <br/>
play Bards and<br/>
                  still wield 2-handed equipment (like their special staff).<br/>
<br/>
                  Q. What are the most important stats as a Bard?<br/>
                  A. Well, because no matter what I answer, someone will <br/>
disagree with me, I<br/>
                  will say this:  No matter what your starting stats, odds <br/>
are, you will<br/>
                  eventually be able to balance any deficiencies out with <br/>
magic items and<br/>
                  jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
                  Okay, well, this FAQ is pretty long as it is - and I&#39;ve <br/>
run out of ideas.<br/>
                  If anyone has any suggestions for the next version, <br/>
please feel free to<br/>
                  send them my way.<br/>
