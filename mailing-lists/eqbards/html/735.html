I&#39;m not going to post the exact penalty numbers, but I will say that a<br/>
troll, with the highest penalty, is only 15%<br/>

<br/>
      Ok, here&#39;s a few myth breakers.<br/>
<br/>
      First off, druids don&#39;t have any experience penalty indoors or out.<br/>
<br/>
      That&#39;s a total myth.<br/>
<br/>
      Druids do have some spells that don&#39;t work indoors, which limits their<br/>
abilities somewhat there. And since dungeons confer a mild 5% experience<br/>
bonus per kill, a druid that kills the same level mobs outdoors will advance<br/>
slower than one that kills them indoors, by a bit.<br/>
<br/>
      A few weeks back, and throughout all of beta, the dungeon bonus was 25<br/>
percent, but this was lowered. I imagine that&#39;s where the druid 75 percent<br/>
rumor got started. And keep in mind that a good many dungeons, or adventure<br/>
zones as Verant classifies them, are flagged as outdoor anyway, such as<br/>
Crushbone, Blackburrow, Mistmoore, Unrest, Cazic-Thule, Highpass (both<br/>
zones), and Kedge Keep.<br/>
<br/>
      Next thing is the &#39;virtual&#39; experience point system. Each class and<br/>
race combo has a set number of experience points it needs to advance to the<br/>
next level. Human warriors do have the lowest numerical requirement, while a<br/>
Troll shadowknight has the highest. Compared to a human warrior, a troll sk<br/>
requires roughly 30 percent more experience each level.<br/>
<br/>
      Now, using round numbers, a 10th level human warrior and a 10th troll<br/>
SK group.<br/>
<br/>
      Since the troll SK needed 30% more experience to get to tenth, the<br/>
game treats him as if he was 30% higher in level, in figuring the experience<br/>
split.<br/>
<br/>
      In virtual levels, the SK is 13th level, and as such, he gets a bigger<br/>
share per kill. This is offset of course, by the fact that the warrior needs<br/>
less experience to level, so the warrior still advances a bit faster.<br/>
<br/>
      Now, if the troll SK was 13th in actual levels, and the warrior still<br/>
10th, the warrior would get far far less experience per kill, since there&#39;s<br/>
now nearly a 7 level spread in virtual experience. This is intentional, and<br/>
a good thing. Why? Because a 10th level warrior teamed with a 13th level SK<br/>
has a far easier time making the kills, there&#39;s less risk for the warrior,<br/>
so there&#39;s less reward.<br/>
<br/>
      Do these virtual levels actually equate to the difference in<br/>
capability of each class? Not at first, but as the hybrid and casting<br/>
classes gain levels and spells, they become more and more potent, and at<br/>
around 30th level, they are indeed that much more effective than their pure<br/>
melee counterparts, in many situations.<br/>
<br/>
      This doesn&#39;t mean a 30th warrior is a wimp compared to a 30th<br/>
shadowknight, or wizard. But a warrior required so much less experience to<br/>
obtain that level. It&#39;s a matter of getting what you paid for.<br/>
<br/>
      The reason they went to this system was because in beta, they didn&#39;t<br/>
consider virtual levels. It was all based on your numerical levels. It<br/>
didn&#39;t take long for hybrid classes to fall so far behind their non-hybrid<br/>
groupmates that catching up was next to impossible.<br/>
<br/>
      It was further aggravated by the fact that each level one of their<br/>
friends gained on them meant that much LESS experience for them, making the<br/>
gap grow even wider. Before long, the hybrids either had to clock enourmous<br/>
amounts of non-grouped time to keep up, or drop out of the group completly.<br/>
This was a bad thing. It happened on a smaller scale with monks, casters,<br/>
and healers, but took a lot more levels to become a problem.<br/>
<br/>
      In an attempt to preserve group integrity, they went to the virtual<br/>
level system, which while still having problems, is a lot better than the<br/>
old way.<br/>
<br/>
      Now, some folks reading this are going to think that hybrids are<br/>
experience leeches. That may be true, but they also bring a lot of power to<br/>
the group, on a purely numerical basis, and given the same amount of group<br/>
time, should level not much faster or slower than the rest of the group.<br/>
<br/>
      Then there&#39;s the friendship factor. If you play a warrior and your<br/>
friends play a ranger and paladin, are you going to stop grouping with them<br/>
because they get more experience per kill? You shouldn&#39;t, since in the long<br/>
run, it&#39;s a wash, level wise.<br/>
<br/>
      And this game would be pretty damned dull if there were only pure<br/>
melee and pure casting classes.<br/>
<br/>
      Here&#39;s a listing of classes in experience order, lowest to highest<br/>
<br/>
      1. Warrior<br/>
<br/>
      2. Rogue (very small gap between rogue and warrior, and some<br/>
class/race combos are lower than warrior class combos, half elf rogue takes<br/>
less exp to level than a barbarian warrior, for example)<br/>
<br/>
      3. Monk (modest gap between monk and rogue)<br/>
<br/>
      Wizard/Mage/Enchanter/Necromancer (very small gap between them and a<br/>
monk)<br/>
<br/>
      Cleric/Shaman/Druid (small gap over the magi)<br/>
<br/>
      Ranger/Bard/Paladin/Shadowknight (large gap over the healers)<br/>
<br/>
      Here&#39;s the race list, again in lowest to highest:<br/>
<br/>
      1. Human/Erudite (no special abilities)<br/>
<br/>
      2. Half elf (infravision)<br/>
<br/>
      2. High Elf (infravision)<br/>
<br/>
      3. Gnome (infravision, tinkering)<br/>
<br/>
      4 Dwarf (infravision, sense heading)<br/>
<br/>
      4 Wood elf (hide, forage, infravision)<br/>
<br/>
      4. Dark elf (hide, sneak, ultravision)<br/>
<br/>
      4. Barbarian (slam, high combat stats)<br/>
<br/>
      5. Halfling (hide, sneak, infravision, higher total stat points)<br/>
<br/>
      6. Ogre (infravision, slam, higher stat point total)<br/>
<br/>
      7. Troll (infravision, regeneration, slam)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      Where did I get this information? I asked, and was informed by the<br/>
development team, throughout all of beta. It&#39;s pretty acurate.<br/>

&gt;You&#39;re kidding, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do other races have even worse hits? (Ogres, Trolls, Erudites)<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;what does everyone think is the best places to put the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;extra attribute points into?  also, what is the best race<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;for a bard?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;thanks<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Rasmussen, monk of the 6th chamber<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;soon to be a bard as well ;)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Well, I don&#39;t think there is any one best race.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Personally - I wouldn&#39;t go with human simply because they can&#39;t see in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;&gt; dark, but some people don&#39;t mind that (and I&#39;m glad, it gives our class a<br/>
&gt;&gt; little more variety). I think they have the best base strength?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; My favorite is Half-elf just because I&#39;m partial to them. They have<br/>
decent<br/>
&gt;&gt; stats, and can see in the dark. They are a little more robust than<br/>
&gt;&gt; Wood-elves.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; But then again, wood-elves are cool because they are more agile/dextrous,<br/>
&gt;&gt; AND they get the cool wood elf abilities (hide/forage).<br/>
