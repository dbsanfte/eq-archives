<div id="ygrps-yiv-104696287">snip Kinda curious how other guilds are able to keep going<br/>
strong?snip<br/>
<br/>
	Defenders of Aleria (DOA) has to struggle to maintain our core<br/>
group, while at the same time staying big enough for planes, dragons etc..<br/>
The fact of the matter is that it is a constant struggle, and there have<br/>
been occasional blow-ups and splits etc. over the years.  It does help that<br/>
the &quot;core&quot; of DOA have all been together for 4 years through a couple<br/>
different online games, although our original guildleader Kvasir left with a<br/>
few others during a split to form Phoenix Arising.<br/>
<br/>
	One thing I think that has essentially kept us intact and together<br/>
as friends is that we have a 100% agreement on new members.  We temp tag 6<br/>
people for 1month at a time.  If after 1 month even a single DOA member has<br/>
an objection, that person is not allowed into the guild.  This may seem a<br/>
little harsh, but it has worked for us.<br/>
<br/>
	A big problem on Bertox is that Prophecy (the big bad guild of the<br/>
server) constantly tries to recruit those over lvl 50, and DOA and other<br/>
guilds have lost a number of good players to them.  Prophecy can offer<br/>
literaly five hunts a week against either dragons, gods or big kunark<br/>
critters. The gear that is inherent to the frequency of those types of hunts<br/>
attracts the &quot;gear hungry&quot; types to them.<br/>
<br/>
	DOA is about friends first, gear and hunts second.  We dont have a<br/>
level limit, but most of the guild falls into the 35 plus range with some<br/>
exceptions.  Our membership numbers hang around 50...with 25 or so active<br/>
most of the time.  For most of our big hunts, we act in concert with other<br/>
friendly guilds on Bertox.<br/>
