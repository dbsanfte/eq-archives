<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714020979">I wonder if the GM/Guide bards have a percussion instrument that is above,<br/>
and beyond, the Drum of Selo&#39;s March and/or Mistmoore Battledrum.  You<br/>
should have offered to trade :)<br/>
<br/>
Slightly off-topic :<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant has done a wonderful job with the game.  Unfortunately, if<br/>
you spend any amount of time reading the garbage on alt.games.everquest,<br/>
you&#39;d be amazed at what some people will bitch about.  Rubicite is a perfect<br/>
example.... for so long people have been whining about the camping, KS&#39;ing,<br/>
and all the morons surrounding Rubicite.  People also bitch that there is no<br/>
QUEST in Everquest (which I strongly disagree with).  Anyway, Verant goes<br/>
in, removes Rubicite - adds new quests for class-specific armor and now<br/>
everyone is bitching that they took rubicite away!!!  So outrageous.  Also,<br/>
some warrior went on this huge rant about Lambent armor - he was disgusted<br/>
that it was better than rubicite and crafted and that Warriors should get<br/>
the &quot;best&quot; armor in the game.  The funny thing is that I _never_ hear bards<br/>
bitching that it isn&#39;t fair that we don&#39;t have weapons equivalent to<br/>
Bladestorm, Langseaxe of the Wolves, Soul Leech, etc, etc.  I just don&#39;t<br/>
understand some of these people.<br/>

&gt; On Innorruk server I saw someone in black mail(?) maybe plate <br/>
&gt; (blackened)<br/>
&gt; and he was moving pretty fast so I kicked in selo&#39;s and my <br/>
&gt; Mistmoore drum...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OMG!! Can&#39;t catch him??? wtf???  He stops by Kith tunnel and <br/>
&gt; I catch up and<br/>
&gt; can see his name &quot;Harmany&quot; and I do a /w on him and...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; YIKES!  He&#39;s a bard and a GM! (or maybe Guide) But WOO HOO!! <br/>
&gt; We have a GM<br/>
&gt; Bard!  So, I say Hi and stuff and chat.  I hope it helps us <br/>
&gt; get some points<br/>
&gt; across.  TBH, I think Verant does listen and they do react <br/>
&gt; but they set<br/>
&gt; their own priority and have their own vision.  I think they got very<br/>
&gt; surprized at how their &#39;community&#39; evolved so fast and are <br/>
&gt; finally coming to<br/>
&gt; grips with things - new zones, changing stuff that&#39;s over <br/>
&gt; camped, dealing<br/>
&gt; with KS&#39;ers, etc.<br/>

&gt; 		The other day when i was hunting in Steamfont a <br/>
&gt; Guide showed<br/>
&gt; up and was just<br/>
&gt; 		standing there next to us.  He was kind of fun <br/>
&gt; to talk to,<br/>
&gt; explained to us<br/>
&gt; 		why we dont see GM Solist anymore on Sol Ro, <br/>
&gt; Seems he got<br/>
&gt; killed by Nagafen.<br/>
&gt; 		And from there a second guide guild was formed, an evil<br/>
&gt; one...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Anyways, i asked him if he would race me, i <br/>
&gt; equipped my mm<br/>
&gt; drum and blasted<br/>
&gt; 		way ahead of him, but turned out he didnt have <br/>
&gt; run on (duh)<br/>
