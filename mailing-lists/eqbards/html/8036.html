<div id="ygrps-yiv-895828186">That is one of the most annoying things for me concerning EQ - our Charm<br/>
cap.  I don&#39;t understand the logic behind it at all.  If they did it because<br/>
we&#39;re infringing upon the powers of the enchanter, why the heck did they<br/>
give it to us in the first place?  It&#39;s okay for us to Charm any MOB below<br/>
level 37, but out of the question for us to Charm level 38+.  If it is an<br/>
&quot;infringement&quot; issue, why then isn&#39;t Chain capped, or Fear, etc.  Those two<br/>
songs are infringing upon the other classes, and they are much more<br/>
efficient and effective.  It doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with Charm<br/>
itself - it could have been any one of our songs.  Why give us something<br/>
that we can&#39;t use for the remainder of our careers (that we&#39;ve fought so<br/>
hard to attain)??  I don&#39;t know of any other spell, skill or ability that is<br/>
&quot;capped&quot; in this manner (actually, I&#39;ve heard that the Enchanter charms are<br/>
level capped, but they get new ones to replace the old).  And what about the<br/>
alleged level 75 expansion?  The song will be doubly worthless when that<br/>
happens.<br/>

&gt; As far as I know, Pixie Strike does not clear the &quot;sh*t list&quot; in any<br/>
manner.<br/>
&gt; If I pixie strike a large rat, as soon as it&#39;s un-stunned/un-mezzed, it<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; bee-line for me.  If there is a memory blur component it is _very_ weak.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My CHA is 104 (still waiting to get another Opalline Earring and/or the<br/>
Veil<br/>
&gt; that increases CHA - perhaps the leather foot raider cap), but I could<br/>
never<br/>
&gt; reliably pixie strike a faerie guard in lesser faydark.  Often times they<br/>
&gt; would attack me immediately after it&#39;s &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; (even though I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t in attack mode).  For that reason, I considered the song to be<br/>
mostly<br/>
&gt; useless - but then again that&#39;s the only time that I&#39;ve used it.  Also,<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; found that MOBs can get off their spell faster than I can Pixie Strike<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; (even if I sing it immediately after they go into cast mode).  I used to<br/>
&gt; consider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I started using<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; against Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll definitely<br/>
keep<br/>
&gt; playing with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by charm, lullaby,<br/>
&gt; screech, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This is why, later in a bard&#39;s life, it becomes very frustrating when<br/>
you discover you can&#39;t charm a mob over 38. Pixie Strike is a very poor<br/>
substitute for what I mainly used charm for. Casters seem to be able to<br/>
cast fine while lullaby&#39;d so that&#39;s pretty useless as a replacement, and<br/>
screech can be suicide in some dungeons, especially lower guk where<br/>
you&#39;ll probably spend a lot of time. <br/>
<br/>
Oh well, enjoy charm while you&#39;ve got it.<br/>
