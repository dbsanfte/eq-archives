&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Drums of the Beast - walking?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, I just tried out Selo&#39;s on the Drums of the Beast.  While <br/>
&gt; weilding these <br/>
&gt; drums and playing either version of Selo&#39;s doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>
&gt; Even walking <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t help.  You run standard run speed and walk standard <br/>
&gt; walk speed, as <br/>
&gt; though you weren&#39;t playing Selo&#39;s at all.  In fact, weilding <br/>
&gt; a sword and <br/>
&gt; singing Selo&#39;s gives you SOME improvement in speed, but as <br/>
&gt; far as I can <br/>
&gt; tell, Drums of the Beast and Selo&#39;s are 100% incompatible.  I <br/>
&gt; even made <br/>
&gt; mention of that fact in an email to the Developers Corner on <br/>
&gt; the official EQ <br/>
&gt; message board earlier this week, but of course it could have <br/>
&gt; been routed to <br/>
&gt; /dev/null for all the difference it made.  It hasn&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; been posted, much <br/>
&gt; less responded to.  And it was quite a professional non-rant... hehe<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I am led to one conclusion.  I read an email somewhere, I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; remember where, may even have been here, that the new <br/>
&gt; high-level weapons, <br/>
&gt; armor, misc. drops lately have all been items that are really <br/>
&gt; incredibly <br/>
&gt; good, except for one stat that ruins it.  So each item has a <br/>
&gt; drawback that <br/>
&gt; makes you really have to think whether you will use it or <br/>
&gt; not.  In effect, <br/>
&gt; allowing them to create lots of new items for us to drool <br/>
&gt; over without <br/>
&gt; actually making them overpowering.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a bug with <br/>
&gt; the runspeed <br/>
&gt; rolling over, but I&#39;m sure that Verant will consider the <br/>
&gt; incompatability of <br/>
&gt; these drums and Selo&#39;s to be a &quot;feature&quot; as part of the <br/>
&gt; &quot;Vision(tm)&quot;.  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; sure it won&#39;t bother them one bit that this particular &quot;feature&quot; only <br/>
&gt; affects a handful of players and they&#39;ll save money by not <br/>
&gt; having to fix, <br/>
&gt; err, &quot;enhance&quot; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So that&#39;s my 2cp worth.  It would be nice if it worked, but <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s such an <br/>
&gt; awesome drum otherwise, I&#39;m not really going to complain.<br/>
