<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308296627">I wonder if, now that there are those new chat options, people have turned<br/>
Bard songs entirely off, and they are going based on the icons on their<br/>
screen. MAna song, however, does not have an icon (unlike healing)...<br/>
<br/>
You should have them keep Grp bard song up.<br/>
