&gt;      Failure is always a possibility, no way to avoid that.  I would pay the <br/>
&gt;      money for the bar first to minimize your losses.  If it succeeds then pay <br/>
&gt;      the fee for the work.  Since Jewelers are by nature merchants that live and <br/>
&gt;      die by their reputation I don&#39;t think the &#39;sucker&#39; scenario is very likely. <br/>
&gt;       Do a /who and make sure they&#39;re a 24th level enchanter for gold jewelry. <br/>
&gt;      (it&#39;s something in the thirties for platinum)  Lying about the failure I <br/>
&gt;      don&#39;t have a suggestion for other then word of mouth recommendation for an <br/>
&gt;      honest jeweler.  <br/>

upon the components themselves and succeed, you will trade<br/>
them the required components plus a small amount of platinum<br/>
for the piece of jewelry?<br/>

My guildmates and I got a couple black pearls off of griffins<br/>
(which surprisingly began /conning yellow at 31).  We got<br/>
drunk during the guild inauguration party and decided to see<br/>
if we could kill any griffins or hill giants.  :-)<br/>
