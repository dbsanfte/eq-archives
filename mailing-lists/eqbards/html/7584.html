<div id="ygrps-yiv-85839255">The topic &quot;Hey this sounded interesting..&quot; has incited a riot!  I have not<br/>
seen such an aggressive thread in weeks here...and with over 60 posts a day?<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone has some excellent points and makes some good arguments but<br/>
the whole thing is starting to be as pointless and repetitive as flogging a<br/>
dead horse.  <br/>
<br/>
Lets all agree to disagree and move forward with some new discussions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where the debate over what classes are hybrids and what classes<br/>
are not is leading and I&#39;m not sure it really makes any difference.  I know<br/>
some people are going to be offended and angered at me for saying so, and I<br/>
apologize to you profusely, but please give this whole Ping-Pong match a<br/>
rest.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think there is a point to arguing over bind because if Verant<br/>
decides in the future to make some change in this area it is going to have<br/>
to be a sweeping change that gratifies all the classes that currently don&#39;t<br/>
get to self-bind or bind outside of cities.  And if they took binding<br/>
outside of cities away from the classes that can do it...you can imagine<br/>
what EQVault&#39;s forums would look like.<br/>
<br/>
I like you all and respect your opinions but this has gone a bit too far<br/>
don&#39;t you think?<br/>
