&gt; it&#39;s only slightly inaccurate; in that my perspective is that of 33 Bard<br/>

<br/>
  I will agree with you that a majority of the problems deal <br/>
  with overcrowding, but this is mostly overcrowded at the<br/>
  upper end of the spectrum.  When I was in my 20s, Unrest/Highkeep<br/>
  were way overpopulated with players, and Permafrost was a pain<br/>
  in the ass to reach and setup -- but those were things we all<br/>
  dealt with and got past.  Does that not make it a problem?  Of<br/>
  course not.  But it&#39;s not as serious of an issue as the staggering<br/>
  number of L46+ people who are bored and mindlessly looking for <br/>
  something to do.  I would also admit that a major part of the<br/>
  overcrowding in lower level zones, are those same L50 people with<br/>
  nothing to do playing alternate characters.  I see very little <br/>
  influx of new people, true newbies, if I may.  I think once the<br/>
  higher level people have something they can do consistantly on<br/>
  a daily basis, the lower level areas will become slightly less<br/>
  camped.  I have been in SolA quite a few times with 20 players<br/>
  in there.  All 20 players were L40+ looking for items.  I hate<br/>
  doing that, I hate taking up space that other people would <br/>
  benefit more from.  Verant needs to understand that the playerbase <br/>
  is going to be exponentially increasing in L35+ crowd as the server<br/>
  get older, and they need to add higher level areas or upgrade<br/>
  zones that simply aren&#39;t being used to capacity due to pathing<br/>
  problems or poor itemization.<br/>
<br/>
  Your points were well written, and I don&#39;t disagree with<br/>
  your assessment of the issues.<br/>
