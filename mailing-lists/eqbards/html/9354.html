<b>Subject:</b> Kedge keep, tinkered items? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125367369">Sorry, off topic, but with Kedge Keep being a hot toping, I was wondering if<br/>
anyone knows anything about the new tinkered item that lets you breathe<br/>
underwater?  i.e. What&#39;s it called?  Does it have charges?  Do you have to<br/>
wear it?  etc. . .<br/>
