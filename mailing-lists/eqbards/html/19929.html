<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-100271711">Um. That is part of playing on Test. It is one of the things you agree<br/>
to. I played on Test for a while (Faesong started there got a bubble or so<br/>
from 17 before I decided to recreate her on Sol Ro) It was accepted that<br/>
Verant could do anything they wanted with<br/>
Test. Its not a production server. They HAVE done player wipes before.<br/>

&gt;Ouch! :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In case some of you don&#39;t know, the entire player-base on the Test server<br/>
&gt;was wiped yesterday.  Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>
&gt;conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>
&gt;from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but<br/>
&gt;for those<br/>
&gt;that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character over<br/>
&gt;the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from<br/>
&gt;what I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;heard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lyrnia, you had a high level Bard on test, didn&#39;t you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I read on the Gameplay board this morning that Brad is taking suggestions<br/>
&gt;on:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Offering players to move their characters onto the live servers without<br/>
&gt;their items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>
&gt;stinks nonetheless.<br/>
