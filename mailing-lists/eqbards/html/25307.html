<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Master Yael and Nortlav the Scale Keeper - how do you do &#39;em? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-238149627">Yael has uber aggro range. I highly doubt that you can take the scalekeeper<br/>
without Yael having a hissy. When we went there, we fought Yael right on his<br/>
spawn point with no interference from Nortlav. People say that Nortlav<br/>
aggros on golems and regular stuff there. He&#39;s supposed to be coded &quot;beta<br/>
neutral&quot; (i think was the phrase), so he didn&#39;t instant aggro. We finished<br/>
Yael, med and healed up before our butts were handed to us. Yael is a<br/>
cakewalk compared to this guy. I&#39;ve nicknamed him the Highlander. He&#39;s a<br/>
freakin badass. He lifetaps (1500) like VS, though doesn&#39;t hit all that<br/>
hard. I recall double 150-200?? You have been warned. Your best bet is to<br/>
chain rune the main tank and bring a few nukers. One extra plus is to have a<br/>
sacrificial &lt;L10 character to take the first DT from Yael, click the person<br/>
back in as soon as s/he loads. We did this, and the girl took 2 of Yael&#39;s<br/>
DT&#39;s which really was in our favor.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if a recent patch made Yael and Nortlav on same faction. Taking<br/>
them both head on will take nearly 5 groups, double what it would normally<br/>
take. Kiting either of them around would get your force killed in a hurry.<br/>
Yael definitely should not be kited, and Nortlav seems to be pretty high MR.<br/>
Try getting a tash/slow/snare on Nortlav and have the shaman (probably<br/>
retained the aggro) to kite him around while the rest of you work on Yael.<br/>
We were not successful on Nortlav, so this method may not work either.<br/>
