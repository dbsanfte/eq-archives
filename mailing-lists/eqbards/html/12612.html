&gt;  In a recent duel with a L50 cleric, with an MR 109, I resisted<br/>
&gt;  Flash of Light, Stun, Holy Might, and two other stuns they get.<br/>
&gt;  The guy couldn&#39;t get one utility spell off on me.  Then we<br/>
&gt;  tried offensive damage spells.  This is where is got all F&#39;d up.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Retribution.  normally does what? 530ish dmg?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Mystic: MR 109, first cast 100 dmg, second cast 300 dmg (full hit).<br/>
&gt;  Ele/Gu: MR 161, first cast 200 dmg, second cast 250 dmg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Never once did I outright resist the spell.  Resistances are<br/>
&gt;  very cloudy in my mind for dmg based effects right now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had 119 mr when i dueled a lvl 50 cleric friend of mine. I resisted<br/>
everything. EVERYTHING. I just sat there and watched him waste his entire<br/>
mana bar on me. Blind, fear, dd, stun - whatever. 100% resistance. Man i<br/>
felt sorry for him =)<br/>
<br/>
When he ran out of mana i stripped his buffs and chain/feared him to death lol<br/>
