<div id="ygrps-yiv-748196977">I understand that people get upset when people from their small guild<br/>
leave and go to a big guild.  I am in a small guild.  We have like 20<br/>
people, the highest is 35 I think. (I am the only bard, talk about<br/>
pressure to get my Mana Song).  I would be dissapointed if the 35 cleric<br/>
decided to go FOH or someone, but it would also tell me that he wasn&#39;t<br/>
loyal to us, and thus we&#39;re probably better off without him (I am just<br/>
using him as en example, he&#39;s a great guy who has helped me out MANY<br/>
times).]<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is an advantage of being on an old server (Veeshan) with one<br/>
absurdly powerful guild and serveral others who are powerful enough to<br/>
do a planes or dragon raid with just guild members.  (At least three<br/>
others, not to mention the one that left when the server split).  If you<br/>
want to regularly do planes raids and dragons when you get to lvl 46+,<br/>
then you should join one of those guilds.  <br/>
<br/>
As I said be angry with the person who left you not with the people he<br/>
went to...<br/>
