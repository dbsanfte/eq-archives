<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648157762">I wouldn&#39;t make the item disappear automatically..but I would make it<br/>
somewhat like Diablo..an icon popped on the screen signifying your equipment<br/>
needed repair.  The big difference..as you mentioned..is the camping issue.<br/>
Obviously you don&#39;t have to camp for gear in Diablo.  If people don&#39;t watch<br/>
their inventory and repair their gear and then lose the item that they may<br/>
have spent many, many hours camping...ouch.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard different stories about the hell levels.  Supposedly Verant<br/>
&#39;accidentally put this code into the game?  And then decided to leave it<br/>
there as a feature?  Hard to believe.  Even harder to believe given Brad<br/>
McQuaid&#39;s past statements. One thing McQuaid has said..and I have probably<br/>
repeated here..is that he &quot;never said it would be an easy game&quot;.  Of the 3<br/>
major MMORPGs (EQ, UO, AC) Everquest is probably the most difficult and the<br/>
most unforgiving for player mistakes.<br/>

&gt; The only problem with this though is with items like jboots or quest<br/>
items.<br/>
&gt; People who camped drelzna for hours upon hours or the new Ancient Cyclops<br/>
&gt; are going to be very pissed when that item dissapears. Overall it&#39;s just<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; worth it because it&#39;s going to cause people to put more time in this game<br/>
&gt; something Verant try&#39;s it&#39;s best to do.  Speaking of did you know<br/>
according<br/>
&gt; to Verant hell levels are a feature?<br/>
