&gt; I agree with this.  Also, there is a big difference in twinking a character<br/>
&gt; that has never played, and twinking one who already has several high level<br/>
&gt; characters.  I have a level 27 bard, and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; suffer through the wimpiness of low levels with a new character I start.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m certainly not going to give them really incredible items, but fine<br/>
&gt; steel, some leather, and some plat certainly takes some of the boredom out<br/>
&gt; of levels 1-10.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, the key I think is to strike a balance between items<br/>
which take some of the edge off starting from scratch, while<br/>
not giving so much of an advantage that you&#39;re nigh unbeatable<br/>
for the level.  If you don&#39;t learn the lessons of what the<br/>
class can and can&#39;t do between levels 1-5, you&#39;re going to<br/>
learn them between levels 6-10, when you get experience loss<br/>
for the deaths accompanying those learning experiences.<br/>
<br/>
For the twinker this is usually not a problem because the<br/>
twinking accelerates his level progression more than the<br/>
experience loss hurts.  For the folks grouped with him though,<br/>
this can be another matter, as they end up grouped with a<br/>
player who either does not know how to play the class to best<br/>
advantage (e.g. bards doing nothing but bellowing during a<br/>
fight, then healing after), or gets them into situations<br/>
likely to get them killed because hey if one of them is a<br/>
close match for me, three of them should be no problem for my<br/>
group of six.<br/>
