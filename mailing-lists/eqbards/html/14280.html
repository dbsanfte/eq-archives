<div id="ygrps-yiv-678036386">Ugh. this post I find very undesirable reading. I think opinions about<br/>
Verant&#39;s quality should be left off this list. The start of this thread<br/>
was basically a request to keep things from being a &quot;flame Verant&quot; event<br/>
if I understood correctly. This entire post was nothing but a long rant,<br/>
and just showed to drive the orginial poster&#39;s point home. If your<br/>
intent is to drive people away from reading eqbards that want to learn<br/>
more about the bard class, you are succeeding.<br/>
<br/>
Please refrain from posting this sort of rant. It&#39;s not someone I want<br/>
cluttering my inbox. Here&#39;s an example for you. If you go to a fine<br/>
restaurant, then order food, but dislike it intensely, complain to the<br/>
chef of it&#39;s quality, then demand your money back, do you go back there<br/>
the next night for dinner, hoping the chef has miraculously changed his<br/>
cooking style to suit you?<br/>
<br/>
If you answer yes, you are either very naive or live in a very small and<br/>
secluded cave. We don&#39;t have to agree on the quality of Verant&#39;s<br/>
product, but this isn&#39;t the forum to discuss it. If you are so woefully<br/>
dissatisfied, QUIT PLAYING IT. It is a recreational thing, not a<br/>
brokerage firm that has all your money.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I want to help Verant, I have ideas, I have time to test, I even<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt;   the patience to live through their mistakes.  But every g&#39;damn time<br/>
&gt;   I log into the game, I&#39;m riddled by bugs, by crashes, by problems.<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s amazing that it even still works, although they will claim it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   never been broken.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Yeah, I could grow up a little, and lay off the cursing, lay off the<br/>
&gt;   Flame Verant bandwagon, but they&#39;ve lost their players admiration in<br/>
&gt;   this &#39;vision&#39; they have.  If they want to keep screwing around with<br/>
&gt;   things because it fits their ideas of the game they want without<br/>
&gt;   considering what the players are looking for in their game, they<br/>
&gt;   are bound for a rude awakening.<br/>
