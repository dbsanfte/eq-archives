<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698998790">Hehehe I just got my prod, but I fought him there, in the throne room<br/>
area... over in the left corner... charmed his pet until that was dead, then<br/>
realized i didnt have selo&#39;s up (had memmed charm in its place) so i mezzed<br/>
his ugly sarnak butt and memmed that then fought him til i was low in<br/>
health, messed him again, healed up, stuck chains on him when he tried to<br/>
run and killed him :)   I&#39;m not a great bard either, just konw with my<br/>
shaman I probably would have been toast!<br/>
<br/>
But I agree Minkin, I seldom, if ever solo with Tani in a closed space.  But<br/>
thats what I meant earlier about choosing your mobs and location carefully.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; depends on the area Halana... I know in closed quarters I&#39;d <br/>
&gt; rather pull out<br/>
&gt; my lower level necro then to use my bard, my bard got ganked 2-3 times<br/>
&gt; getting my prod for HS key just cause I got lost on the way <br/>
&gt; out of the maze<br/>
&gt; (dumb dumb) and I couldnt go toe to toe with him or pull him <br/>
&gt; out of the maze<br/>
&gt; properly either, really irritating.  After much aggravation I <br/>
&gt; logged in my<br/>
&gt; necro and went after him. The pet kept the whole room empty <br/>
&gt; without losing<br/>
&gt; any hp, when the named spawned I unloaded all my mana on it <br/>
&gt; as I wanted<br/>
&gt; payback for the aggravation he&#39;d given me.  I also had alot <br/>
&gt; of fun there<br/>
&gt; though with Antic (ya remember him dont ya) pulling as many <br/>
&gt; as I could and<br/>
&gt; He&#39;d AE them, that was truly fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But on a soloing front, I&#39;d say outdoors bards are great, <br/>
&gt; indoors I&#39;d rather<br/>
&gt; not even think about it untill I have more AC or my epic or something.<br/>

&gt; Hmm well I can see your point, and  probably haven&#39;t noticed <br/>
&gt; it because I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t been on many raids with my bard.  But the shammy <br/>
&gt; getting exp on<br/>
&gt; raids? *dies laughing*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I would like to see is raid platinum distribution <br/>
&gt; myself.  In a month<br/>
&gt; of guild hunts, I&#39;ve not seen a single pp... yet those rogues <br/>
&gt; and rangers<br/>
&gt; &quot;give it all to the guild&quot; - yeah, right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone tells me that bards are bad at soloing, and that <br/>
&gt; shaman are the<br/>
&gt; best.  I can solo 10 times better with my bard.  Personally, <br/>
&gt; I think its<br/>
&gt; because people are very poor at picking out &quot;soloable&quot; areas and mobs.<br/>
&gt; What a shaman can solo, a mage will crumple on, etc.  I guess <br/>
&gt; I tend to look<br/>
&gt; at things like how long actual downtime is, the ability to <br/>
&gt; handle multiple<br/>
&gt; mobs and play with a variety of classees rather than just <br/>
&gt; damage dealing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kinda funny how things are on other servers and other guilds, <br/>
&gt; SK&#39;s are like<br/>
&gt; the joke of our guild.  We have 1 SK and 1 Paladin lol!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t really agree. We are fairly weak at soloing and not <br/>
&gt; very good<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage dealers in groups. More over, we are weak in raids. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I agree with Aftathott on this one. Verant did a very good <br/>
&gt; &gt; job balancing<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bards in solo and group situations. But we are far less <br/>
&gt; &gt; valuable in raid<br/>
&gt; &gt; situations.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Raids are one area VI should definitely spend some time on before<br/>
&gt; &gt; releasing Luclin. I hope they address XP in raids, class <br/>
&gt; &gt; balance in raids<br/>
&gt; &gt; and communication (chat) in raids.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; More and more of the game is around raids where the top <br/>
&gt; &gt; Warrior, Rogue,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shammy, Chanter and Cleric take the XP. The 6th spot is very <br/>
&gt; &gt; likely a Monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; for pulling, but mages, wizzies and SKs are all more <br/>
&gt; &gt; preferred than Bards.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ugh....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Its funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of <br/>
&gt; &gt; keeping a low<br/>
&gt; &gt; profile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice. Seriously, don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; laugh, its just<br/>
&gt; &gt; that bards seem very overpowered to me at higher levels, <br/>
&gt; then again 60<br/>
&gt; &gt; shaman with Can IV.... I used to think all level 60 were <br/>
&gt; &gt; equally powerful<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I&#39;m changing my thoughts.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I hope nobody else figures this out!<br/>
