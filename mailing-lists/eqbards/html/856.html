<b>Subject:</b> Clarification about bronze weight <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-94395423">I have not returned to the game since I originally posted the weight of<br/>
bronze to be less than platemail.<br/>
<br/>
I assume I was incorrect given the number of people who have corrected me,<br/>
so I withdraw my assertion.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember checking it out, and the weight difference was not very great<br/>
in any case, even if bronze was slightly heavier.<br/>
<br/>
About Paw loot: Staves sell for 35 plat on Fenin Ro, and the snakeskin<br/>
armor goes anywhere from 4 to 8 plat. One staff, 12 snakeskin and some gems<br/>
and research item easily gives 100 plat per haul.<br/>
<br/>
And of course you are right about Zixx. I haven&#39;t even tried him yet . . .<br/>
but it is easy to just leave him alone.<br/>

&gt;| Bronze is found in Unrest, and you can easily buy it there from higher<br/>
&gt;| level players who loot it.<br/>
&gt;|<br/>
&gt;| It has the same AC and slightly less weight than the platemail that you<br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;| buy from merchants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Really? I was under the impression that it is way heavier than regular<br/>
&gt;plate. If this is correct why would anyone ever buy normal plate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;| If you want some easy loot in a safe dungeon, go to Paw. At level 18 you<br/>
&gt;| can solo the whole place, but still get exp from captains, commanders, and<br/>
&gt;| the high shamans. Snakeskin armor and the sought after runed totem staff<br/>
&gt;| are your rewards. I bring back 100 plat worth of loot on every trip. And<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;| Fenin Ro the zone goes neglected. I have never seen it with more than 20<br/>
&gt;| people, and very often I am the only one there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	I would agree that Paws is underpopulated in most servers (Cazic averages<br/>
&gt;10-15 in evenings) and the loot is quite decent although 100 plat might be<br/>
&gt;high unless you sell the staves at a high price.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	*<br/>
&gt;	*<br/>
&gt;	*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Soloing *all* of it at level 18 I can&#39;t quite agree with. Ghanex Drah can<br/>
&gt;bring some tense moments at times and Zixx Nenixx will simply smoke your @#$<br/>
&gt;all the way back to the zoneline. That is, if he doesn&#39;t charm you first. =)<br/>
&gt;He was red to me at 20 and was frequently hitting for 50. Then there is his<br/>
&gt;pet. And he seems to get some decent help from the locals too...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Good Journey,<br/>

&gt;&gt;Looking for some good ideas for soloing and small team hunting around 18th<br/>
&gt;&gt;level.  Currently I am hunting Beholder Maze frequently , sometimes high<br/>
&gt;&gt;hold pass or Oasis of Marr.  Any good suggestions?  Are any of the<br/>
&gt;multitude<br/>
&gt;&gt;of islands out in the Ocean of Tears any good?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Unfortunately I seem to have solo hunting and hunting with a cleric partner<br/>
&gt;&gt;down to an art, but whenever I get into a group I always seem to die.  As<br/>
&gt;&gt;you all know, we frequently become the baiters because of our speed, and<br/>
&gt;&gt;because of that if you pick up more than the chosen monster to fight<br/>
&gt;&gt;accidentally, death is not a far step away.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, I am outfitted in full banded, but have not even seen a place with<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;bronze armor some have spoken of, or some of the many magic items that<br/>
&gt;&gt;proliferate the deeper dungeons.<br/>
