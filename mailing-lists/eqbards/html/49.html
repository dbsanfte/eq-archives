&gt;I was wondering if anyone else has set a standard for corpse relocations.<br/>
&gt;I usually charge 5 GP minimum for up to level 5, plus 1 GP/2 levels rounded<br/>
&gt;up.  This is standard, plus I usually ask for tips or danger pay.    Does<br/>
&gt;this sound like too little?  Maybe it should be 1 PP/2 levels after level<br/>
&gt;10?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Personally I only ask for aid in returning to a safe city if it takes me<br/>
where I do not feel I can&#39;t get safely back from. I tend not to charge for<br/>
serves especially to inexperienced people. This is do to a personal creed of<br/>
service to aid my fellow travelers.<br/>
    I also have served as mediator to merchants for those handicapped by<br/>
race prejudice. For it is hard when you can not even get a simple loaf of<br/>
bread, and you are not in a friendly town. The chances of getting home<br/>
diminish for lack of a simple necessity.<br/>
<br/>
    But it is not wrong to charge as well, a bard must eat... No matter how<br/>
it is done, as long as it is not though unfair practice that I will balk at.<br/>
Then again, unfair is a reltive term, left for each to decide on...<br/>
