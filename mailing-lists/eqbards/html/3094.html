keyboard.  If you hold down the right mouse button (go into<br/>
mouselook mode), the left/right keys will strafe you instead<br/>
of turn you.  Once you figure this out, it&#39;s pretty trivial to<br/>
circle a mob while facing him to keep a lookout around you.<br/>
Do be careful not to do it too much, as I&#39;ve heard your chance<br/>
to land a blow decreases if you&#39;ve moved that &quot;round.&quot;<br/>

industry calls straight translation motion &quot;slewing.&quot;)<br/>

Otherwise it&#39;s too easy to just turn with the mouse.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I *would* like is to be able to switch mouselook<br/>
from right mouse button down, to right mouse button toggle.<br/>
Sometimes it gets tiring holding that button down for several<br/>
minutes.<br/>
