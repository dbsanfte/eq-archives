<b>Subject:</b> (OT) Tech problem, any suggestions? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-931711050">I know this is OT, but its driving me nuts. gotta get back ingame asap<br/>
before i get withdrawal symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
I have a celeron 300 overclocked at 466 running on an abit bh6 or bx6 mother<br/>
board for about 2 years now runnin on win98. Run a voodoo 3000 vid card and<br/>
an sb live, oh and a 1* 128meg sim of 100mhz ram.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my problem, I pretty much only play EQ, check email and surf.  Lately<br/>
i&#39;ve had a few solid lockups playing eq, some crashes to desktop as well.<br/>
Yesterday i got 2 in 10-15 minutes and the day before i died while kiting<br/>
due to this (grrr)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I tried deinstalling EQ, reinstalling EQ, RoK and SoV.  While<br/>
reinstalling SoV, total lockup again.  This indicated to me that probably my<br/>
pc is overheating or something.  Another thing i&#39;ve noticed while playing is<br/>
that my graphics seem to be choppier than normal (more vid lag, and its not<br/>
swarmcaller) (which indicates to me processing problems).<br/>
<br/>
So... Tonight I&#39;m going to probably rip the pc open, check if my fan is<br/>
still working, if it is i&#39;ll proceed to downclock the cpu back to 300 like<br/>
its supposed to be.  If my pc is still acting up from there i&#39;ll reinstall<br/>
win98 (arg i hate doing this, takes forever with all my apps).<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the prob may be, I have a<br/>
feeling my cpu might be nearing retirement but i&#39;m really hoping this isnt<br/>
the case because i dont have the cash to buy a new chip/board cause that<br/>
would run me about 350$ canadian for a 700mhz/board<br/>
