<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858235042">I&#39;m amazed at how many bards from E&#39;ci frequent this list.  I get &quot;hiyas&quot;<br/>
all the time, many times from bards I have never met before who at least<br/>
read this list, even if they don&#39;t post.<br/>
<br/>
Funniest thing that happened to me.  I and three of my guildmates were<br/>
setting up to hunt in Overthere.  As I ran up, a bard from the other group<br/>
already pulling to the zoneline shouts, &quot;Hey it&#39;s Kitasi from the bard&#39;s<br/>
list&quot;.  Of course my fellow guildmates then proceeded to play like total<br/>
Ebay twinkies.  I was so mad at their antics, the two casters kept running<br/>
around so that the cleric and I were totally unable to do anything, that I<br/>
finally gave up on them and went over to Frontier to hunt giants.  all I<br/>
could think that whole night was, &quot;Oh great, now that bard knows I know<br/>
better right?&quot;<br/>

Umm... this list and the Concert Hall have been around since the game was<br/>
released.  Any bard, no matter if high level or low level, who was so<br/>
inclined<br/>
so therefore can give other classes a bad impression of the bard class.<br/>
Those<br/>
that do know how to adapt will amaze their group, establish a reputation as<br/>
a<br/>
good bard, and usually have no problems finding a group to join.<br/>
