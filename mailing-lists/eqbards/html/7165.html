<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341414037">This is definitely true.  However, I still think that the complaint that<br/>
&quot;foraging with our current cap makes the skill useless&quot; is a fundamentally<br/>
untrue statement.  It may not be as useful as you like, but it is certainly<br/>
useful.  This is hardly in the same category as say hide, which without the<br/>
rogue-only notification of success and combination with stealth is<br/>
completely useless and never gets used.  Not to mention the other trap<br/>
related skills which we share with rogues.  Just trying to put it in<br/>
prespective.  I really don&#39;t think the forage thing is something we have a<br/>
chance of getting, since it would be an enhancement of an already somewhat<br/>
useful power.<br/>
<br/>
I would agree with most of the other suggestions though.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s been Kabong&#39;ed, but just wanted to add a final note about<br/>
binding.  I campaigned from mid beta (was in phase 1, but played a wizard,<br/>
so I didn&#39;t really notice this until phase 3, when I started playing bards)<br/>
to allow everyone to bind outside of cities, and was flatly refused.  There<br/>
were many discussions about it on the beta boards, and ultimately it seems<br/>
a hardcore element at Verant (no names were ever mentioned) decreed that<br/>
the way it is now, it will always be, despite many articulate arguments to<br/>
the contrary.  Depressing...just like the group damage for determining<br/>
kills.  I suppose they have their reasons.  Doesn&#39;t mean I have to like the<br/>
consequences.<br/>

&gt;I can confirm this is the case. I dabble in brewing also.  I have tried<br/>
&gt;foraging in numerous zones since the patch that changed foraging.  When I<br/>
&gt;have been successful, I still get the old foraging items (i.e. roots and<br/>
&gt;vegetables), not any of the new foraging items.  Our foraging skill is<br/>
&gt;capped high enough to get food/water for regular subsistence, but not high<br/>
&gt;enough to forage any of the unique items.    <br/>

&gt;&gt; I personally forage to be a brewer since I think bards should help spread<br/>
&gt;&gt; the good word of the pleasures of fine beverages.  The forage skill we<br/>
&gt;&gt; have<br/>
&gt;&gt; is too low for that kind of foraging.  Our foraging is sufficient to not<br/>
&gt;&gt; starve, but that&#39;s about it.  I have run naked from Halas to Freeport<br/>
&gt;&gt; (don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; ask) and even though I was constantly foraging ended the run with 1 extra<br/>
&gt;&gt; set of berries and thirsty.  I&#39;d also think we should be able to get some<br/>
&gt;&gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the specials at least occassionally.  Most of our caps are really too low<br/>
&gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; be particularly useful, and just high enough to be mildly interesting.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I would agree with the assessment that forage is not too low.  And if it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; low at all, it&#39;s certainly not too low to be useful.  I think it&#39;s perfect<br/>
&gt;&gt; for what they intended.  They intended it to be not as good as a full<br/>
&gt;&gt; fledged forager would have.  I forage way more than enough food, and just<br/>
&gt;&gt; slightly less than enough water to keep me alive.  So I can forage enough<br/>
&gt;&gt; berrires and fruit and such to give to my brewing friends, and still have<br/>
&gt;&gt; plenty of food to eat.  I don&#39;t mind that I have to buy water every so<br/>
&gt;&gt; often, since characters without forage at all have to do it a lot more<br/>
&gt;&gt; often.  I think those who think it is useless are either too lazy to press<br/>
&gt;&gt; the button often enough, or have a case of sour grapes (or is that<br/>
&gt;&gt; berries?)<br/>
