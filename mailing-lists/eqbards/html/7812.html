&gt; &gt; With a running leap out of there you can get a great jump into the lava<br/>
&gt; &gt; pool. We got some great screenshots. The dwarf is especially funny<br/>
&gt; &gt; because when they do a running jump their animation makes them do a<br/>
&gt; &gt; summersault. With my slightly pumped up fire resist (BI Crown, Fork)<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was taking maybe 22 hp damage and if I sang chant of cooling I took<br/>
&gt; &gt; about 16.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I took 44 points/sec with 25 fire resist.  Playing Elemental<br/>
&gt; Rhythms raised that to 71 resist, and I took 26 points/sec.<br/>
&gt; Dunno if level or AC plays a part.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I have around 40 odd with items and chant takes me up well over<br/>
100. Diving in and swimming to shore caused me to lose about one bubble<br/>
of health (1143 is what I have I think).<br/>
<br/>
That said I&#39;m still glad the time I lost my corpse to a fire giant<br/>
summoning me that the GM considered it a bug and summoned my corpse to<br/>
the zone. He said it was under a ledge somewhere in the lava where I<br/>
never would have got it out.<br/>
