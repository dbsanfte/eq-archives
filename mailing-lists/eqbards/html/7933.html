<div id="ygrps-yiv-296283772">Gads I hope that is the case.  My first two regular groups ahve all but<br/>
fallen apart as the various members have ditched their primary characters to<br/>
play binders.  It has been a depressing last month for me group wise.  The<br/>
only time I grouped in the last week it was in Befallen with 2 rangers and a<br/>
cleric.  The cleric blew 80% of his mana every fight nuking the undead and<br/>
the two rangers and I were forced to be healers.  It was silly.  If he<br/>
wanted to play a wizard why didn&#39;t he?  I would dearly love to find a group<br/>
of intelligent players my level who won&#39;t be depending on me to be their<br/>
primary tank.<br/>

&gt; Giving away banded.. doph.. the poor blacksmiths who spent all that time<br/>
&gt; learning the craft so they could be undersold by someone giveing it away.<br/>
	Read my signature below :).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; would think that the game STARTs at level 20 :)  Thats when you started<br/>
&gt; getting stuff for yourself :)  Anyway, I really think that if Verant<br/>
wanted<br/>
	For many of us, the game isn&#39;t about STUFF, but apparently it is<br/>
for you.  Lvl 20 is around the level where current eq players are bridging<br/>
the gap between auction for a random group of similar level people, and<br/>
having a small group of friends they regularly group with.  That was my<br/>
point.<br/>
