<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807501926">I dont mean to toally blow off the Psalm series, I think I use them more<br/>
than most people.  I use the dam shield psalms when I have a mellee heavy<br/>
group which isnt killing things fast enough and I don&#39;t have anything better<br/>
to sing (IE there is a shaman and/or enchanter in the group).  I use one of<br/>
the regen songs if we are suffering too much down time after fights.  I<br/>
actually have use the poison psalm too.  Mainly in Kaesora.</div>
