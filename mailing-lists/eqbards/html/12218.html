<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220817773">I&#39;m with you 100 percent...  If the guy said &quot;My baby&#39;s crying I have to<br/>
leave&quot; or &quot;Shoot I&#39;ve been online too long my wife is screaming at me&quot; or<br/>
&quot;My house is on fire&quot; - then I&#39;d think &quot;c&#39;est la vie&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But - what he basically said was &quot;I&#39;m greedy and I have an opportunity to<br/>
cash in so screw you&quot;...  I certainly would remember his name and hope for<br/>
the day he needs my help and tell him he can put it where the sun don&#39;t<br/>
shine!<br/>

&gt; gotten into a /tell argument with someone over any issue.  Anyone who has<br/>
&gt; ever grouped with me can tell you that I can get along with just about<br/>
&gt; anybody.  This guy pushed me beyond my limits though.  Was I out of line<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; expecting the group leader to stick around?<br/>
