<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256458771">I grumbled about this for a long time, and if they hadn&#39;t fixed Bard mez the way they did, I&#39;d still be<br/>
grumbling about the Enchanters.  But I think you&#39;ll find that a lot of the &quot;needing&quot; Enchanters and<br/>
&quot;needing&quot; Clerics came from people doing all of this stuff with groups averaging around level 52, and not<br/>
knowing how to pull the dungeon properly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a lot of Sebilis, and 3 of the four wings of HS, and fairly deep into Chardok without an<br/>
Enchanter or a Cleric.  A Shaman makes it easier, but Druids have the same healing capability, so if they<br/>
know how to heal (many don&#39;t, they soloed too much), they work fine also.  Paladins (now that they fixed<br/>
the mana pool for Hybrids) also work.  It&#39;s better to have two alternate healers if you&#39;re missing a<br/>
Cleric, but (just as an example) I did Guardian, Zoneout and the hallway down to Disco the other night<br/>
with an Enchanter, a Paladin, a Rogue and myself.  Just the four of us.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t despair.  You&#39;re a little low-level still, Slyde.  When you get Song of Twilight and you get a<br/>
little more practice, you should see what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
I no longer worry much even if we pull four.  Five gets me going a bit, but I&#39;ve lived through every<br/>
five-pull I&#39;ve had for over a month.  I&#39;ve had several fights recently where I was mezzing no fewer than<br/>
three MOBs the entire time, for a total of over 10 MOBs.  (We didn&#39;t get 10 at once, we kept getting adds,<br/>
though.)  Use overhead view, remember that you can target the next MOB as soon as you start the song on<br/>
the previous one, don&#39;t sweat the resists.<br/>
<br/>
I really love going there with my Shaman or Paladin friend, inviting some people at zonein, and then<br/>
telling them we&#39;re going to necros or something.  What!  We have no Enchanter!  We have no Cleric!  You<br/>
can feel the panic rising.  They all have a great time, though.  You will, too.<br/>

&gt; My own personal experience with myself doing crowd control - if I don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; either cleric healing power - or shaman slowing power - I&#39;m going to get<br/>
&gt; killed trying to do crowd control in Sebelis.  Maybe I&#39;ve been unlucky with<br/>
&gt; the group&#39;s I&#39;ve had; and also - I haven&#39;t got 53 yet - so I&#39;m relying on<br/>
&gt; Charm or Pixie Strike - but the point I think is still there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         But maybe - I&#39;m just mediocre...  Regardless - maybe you feel that 80 per<br/>
&gt; cent of the people in the game are mediocre.  Maybe they are - but to me the<br/>
&gt; game is about having an enjoyable entertainment experience; not about<br/>
&gt; competing.<br/>
