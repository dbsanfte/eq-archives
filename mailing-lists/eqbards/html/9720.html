&gt; Currently I am trying to get the Icy greavers, but my main<br/>
&gt; problem is that no one on Bertox seems to hunt in Perma<br/>

&gt; 8-12PST), but getting to king room is not a problem if<br/>
&gt; someone is keeping the area around the first gate clear.<br/>

themselves and others.  If you&#39;re invisible and must pass<br/>
within aggro range of a goblin, /con it first to make sure<br/>
it&#39;s indifferent.<br/>

That said, I&#39;ve had several instances, all in Permafrost and<br/>
Lower Guk (live side), where stuff that I&#39;d /conned as<br/>
indifferent just moments before attacked me.  I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
my invisibility didn&#39;t drop, but they all ended up in trains<br/>
or fights so ugly the first attack scrolled off my buffer.<br/>
