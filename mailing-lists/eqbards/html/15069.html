<div id="ygrps-yiv-516600688"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Hi there, I&#39;m Hire. 14th level bard on Vallon ZEK! I&#39;m nearing<br/>
&gt;&gt; the magical L17 and dual wield, and I&#39;m wondering what are the <br/>
&gt;&gt; most effective weapon? I was thinking of combine longswords <br/>
&gt;&gt; for a while, but it seems now-adays with my fine steel <br/>
&gt;&gt; longsword I&#39;m missing 2/3 of my swings anyway (exaggeration<br/>
&gt;&gt; alert!). Recently switched to a fine steel short and even <br/>
&gt;&gt; though I went from 12 dmg per round to 8, I&#39;m missing a lot<br/>
&gt;&gt; less. There is obviously a balance to be reached, so my question<br/>
&gt;&gt; is .. high delay : high damage? Or vice versa?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Get a logfile parser.  Fight the same mobs for a long time<br/>
&gt;(i.e. camp a spot).  Use one weapon half the time, use the<br/>
&gt;other weapon half the time.  Parse your logfile and figure out<br/>
&gt;which one you do better with.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have the weapons, the patience, or the weapon skill.<br/>
Just looking for some advice is all. From the what has been posted,<br/>
it seems Sylly has had luck with piercing weapons (low damage/delay)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, my piercing skill is... one. So, any advice on good<br/>
slashers or blunt weapons? ( I have a feeling blunt weapons are<br/>
adjusted by Verant to have lower damage/delay ratios than equivalent<br/>
slashing weapons. )<br/>
