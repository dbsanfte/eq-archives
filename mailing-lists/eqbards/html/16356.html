<div id="ygrps-yiv-539690575">yep every stat has always maxxed at 255.  i hope this either goes up in<br/>
expansion (not likely) or they make the diminshing returns after 200 just go<br/>
away (umm, also not likely).<br/>

&gt; A guildbro of mine was messing around to see how much Dex he <br/>
&gt; could build up<br/>
&gt; (buffs, items, etc).  At 255, he hit a wall.  No matter what <br/>
&gt; he did after<br/>
&gt; that, his Dex rose no higher.  Anyone else ever notice that?  <br/>
&gt; I had never<br/>
&gt; seen Verant say whether or not there was a definite maximum <br/>
&gt; limit on stats.<br/>
