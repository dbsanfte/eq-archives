<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862223788">The last time I saw Lord Grimlot he was walking south on the Stone Bridge in<br/>
SK - presuambly collecting tolls from travelers?  I guess I did not have<br/>
exact change and angered him. He attacked me as soon as he saw me and in his<br/>
full steel plate - I decided to make a run for it and crossed into NK and<br/>
the safety of the bridge guards.<br/>
<br/>
If you are thinking of having a conversation with him, I suggest you con him<br/>
from a distance and get your race/religion/faction aligned so that he is<br/>
indifferent or amiable to you.<br/>
