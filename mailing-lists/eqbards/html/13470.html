<b>Subject:</b> Unexpected benefit from PoA?  (Surfing gone) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949200179">Someone on the E&#39;ci message board expressed a similar opinion about PoA<br/>
being a major money sink.  The poster theorized that the following will<br/>
start happening:<br/>
<br/>
46+ level characters generally have more money than they know what to do<br/>
with.  Because PoA is a big money sink, this cash reserve will eventually<br/>
get low and possibly run out.  As a result, 46+ characters will have to go<br/>
back to lower level areas and camp high value items that they don&#39;t need in<br/>
order to sell them for cash so they can get back into PoA.  This will have<br/>
two likely side effects.  First, lower level characters who don&#39;t have the<br/>
high value item will have problems because they will have to compete with<br/>
46+ level characters for the spawn point.  Second effect is that now it will<br/>
become easier to buy these items for cash.  Prior to the patch (when<br/>
platinum was plentiful), most people would only trade a high value item for<br/>
another high value item that they could use.  <br/>
<br/>
IMO, this could turn out to be an unexpected side benefit from the PoA.  A<br/>
lot of people, myself included, are not inclined or don&#39;t have the time<br/>
required to camp for high value items.  As a result, it was difficult for<br/>
those type of players to obtain the item on their own or to purchase it from<br/>
someone.  It now appears that this option may soon become a viable<br/>
alternative.<br/>
