----------------------<br/>
<br/>
The following changes have been implemented with the latest patch, most<br/>
importantly, changes to corpse resurrection. It should be noted that all<br/>
corpses generated previous to this patch may not be resurrected, however,<br/>
all corpses generated from this point forward may be resurrected with the<br/>
changes listed below applying.<br/>
<br/>
- Corpses that are older than 2 hours cannot be resurrected.<br/>
- Corpses that are produced from a duel cannot be resurrected after 10<br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
General Enhancements<br/>
<br/>
- A Yes/No request window is now brought up when ever turning in the PK note<br/>
to the Priest of Discord.<br/>
- It is now possible to manually reorganize icons within the spell book.<br/>
This may be performed by right-clicking on the currently placed icon (the<br/>
icon will then be highlighted), then right-clicking on the desired slot you<br/>
wish to move it.<br/>
- Pet damage inflicted during PvP combat has been slightly reduced.<br/>
- It is now possible to place items marked as &quot;No Drop&quot; in the bank.<br/>
- Experience and looting rights is now awarded based on group aggregate<br/>
damage (i.e. If a group&#39;s combined damage if greater than an individual<br/>
player, the group members will be given the exp. and looting rights).<br/>
- NPC corpses will only remain for 8 minutes, even while looting.<br/>
- If a party member goes link-dead, the remaining members will be notified.<br/>
- Pets with less than 20 hit points cannot receive hit point buffs.<br/>
- When viewing an invisible PC with See Invisible, the name will be shown in<br/>
parentheses over the character.<br/>
- All beneficial speed spells may be canceled left-clicking on the spell<br/>
icon.</div>
