<div id="ygrps-yiv-213922467">Heh not friendly for groups?<br/>
<br/>
Screech:  Any bard who goes into a dungeon where you may have to evac should<br/>
have this memmed.  Also ever fear/snare in burning woods?  Its more<br/>
effective than a balanced group of 6 fighting the mobs straight up there.<br/>
We even have sold our cleric on the idea, and he just blasts the mobs now<br/>
(and heals when things go awry.<br/>
<br/>
Chains:  I always have this memmed in dungeons too.  Why?  Because stuff<br/>
happens.  Your ranger goes LD before snaring.  Someone screws up and roots<br/>
the mob (breaking snare).  There is no snarer in the group (or your snarer<br/>
is too low).  In any case NOBODY else can chase down a mob while casting<br/>
snare in an emrgency.  (Is there a junark armor with snare?  If so make that<br/>
nobody a bit smaller)<br/>
<br/>
Songof the Sirens:  You have to be kidding me.  This is our most powerful<br/>
song (till higher lvl then its the 39 charm song).  Worse case of this song<br/>
is you have one mob damaging the mob the parry is on rather than you 90% of<br/>
the time.  Best case, you have 2 mobs beating on each other, while the party<br/>
kills a third.  Oh yea, tell the enchanter who has half a bub of life when<br/>
you charm the mob off him (giving the healer time to heal) that you<br/>
shouldn;t mem the song when he&#39;s around.  I cannot count the number of<br/>
enchanters/healers/over blasters I have saved with this song.<br/>
<br/>
Clouding:  Ok here there are some problems, BUT an organzied group can use<br/>
this song amazingly well.  Player 1 walks, leading the group to their camp<br/>
in the dungeon.  Rest of group, inlcuding bard singing clouding follows.<br/>
Player 2 who also knows the way &quot;sweeps&quot; behind the group making sure all<br/>
stay close.</div>
