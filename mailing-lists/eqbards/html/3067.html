<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815671778">/e sighs and attempts to twist playfully.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly at 16, I have yet to twist successfully.  I think I did once running<br/>
from a train by accident in a panic.  I&#39;m just now begining my Twisting<br/>
Quest.  Any pointers or tips on what songs twist and just what to expect<br/>
from a twisting experince would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Often its hard in a group where:<br/>
<br/>
1 - The wizard is going &quot;we can take any reds we can find!!!  lets take them<br/>
all on!!!&quot;  Insert death here.<br/>
2 - You thought you were pullin but now 2 other people in the group are<br/>
pullin as well.  Insert death here.<br/>
3 - The tank is on break in multiple tell&#39;s<br/>
4 - No one reports mana so you have to drag it out of them forcing you to<br/>
type, if you cant type - insert death here.<br/>
5 - Hungry Looter spends more time inspecting corpses when he/she should be<br/>
moving on to the next mob in the train currently attacking the wiz or tank.<br/>
6 - No one uses Assist<br/>
7 - You just took 230 dam running off a dune in the Oasis.<br/>
8 - The list keeps goin and goin...<br/>
<br/>
Actually thats mostly a feeble player rant.  Too many feebs out there.. heh.<br/>
But there are some great players, just takes time in finding them.  As a<br/>
bard I try to do whatever I can to aid the party.  A kind of Cleric<br/>
mentality I guess.  With new players in the group that dont know the area if<br/>
they die i&#39;ll run and get them in town with Selo&#39;s, I&#39;ll act as healer when<br/>
need be, mana regenerator as well.  I&#39;ll tank for the Rogue so he can get<br/>
the back stabb,  I&#39;ll try and pull wisely and take on just as much as I<br/>
think we should.  In the higher levels its hard to get just that one yellow<br/>
or red, they tend to come attached with 3-5 blues.  I think the path of a<br/>
bard can be multiple things, failing to see the twisting element shouldnt be<br/>
a mark against a bard.  We&#39;re all learning, some have got the nack that<br/>
others simply havent had time to address or learn about it yet.  Some of us<br/>
are still exploring zones and finding corpses for people, others are acting<br/>
as tanks and magic users, heck of some us are just drunk in taverns makin<br/>
brew!  I think bards rock!  We&#39;re an awesome class, a perfect blend.  Sure I<br/>
want a Glimmer Ring and binding would be nice but it doesnt fit the<br/>
character so put it on me.  As for twisting I will begin experimenting with<br/>
it more, that along with raising my pericing skill, finding more brews to<br/>
make, getting those barbed leggings, find that guy in north karanas that I<br/>
need to give the broken lute too, deliver mail, find corpses for newbies and<br/>
twink them a bit or give them quests for items, and seek out good groupable<br/>
players that wont get me killed or the four other people in the group in the<br/>
first pull.<br/>

&gt; Cycling bard songs is part of what bards do, it&#39;s a feature, and all the<br/>
&gt; song designs reflect that ability.  If any one song was more than a<br/>
cantrip<br/>
&gt; in power, it&#39;d be a different issue, but that&#39;s not the case.  Bard songs<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the whole are very mild in effect, singularly and per verse, but potent<br/>
&gt; combined and over time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s the way it should be, and any bard who is not &#39;twisting&#39;, has<br/>
failed<br/>
&gt; to realize the potential of the class.  It&#39;d be the same as playing a<br/>
&gt; warrior who doesn&#39;t use weapons, a wizard who never memorizes spells, a<br/>
&gt; ranger that doesn&#39;t track, a shadowknight that doesn&#39;t harm touch, a mage<br/>
&gt; that doesn&#39;t use pets, etc. </span></blockquote></div>
