<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261013419">Wow Tork, I agree with a lot of your stuff here!  I have to disagree with<br/>
the Kunark Loot part though.  I think they fixed the yard trash drops<br/>
thankfully, and some of the stuff is pretty over the top, but don&#39;t get me<br/>
started on No Drop.  I hate No Drop so much I could puke.  If all the good<br/>
stuff was No Drop I could flush all my plat down the toilet right now cause<br/>
there would be nothing to spend it on.  Lets keep No Drop for quest items<br/>
and I think it will all work out.<br/>

On Kurnark Loot:<br/>
I HATE it not being NODROP most of all, but also I HATE soloable yard trash<br/>
at the zone line dropping stuff better than stuff my guild spend MONTHS<br/>
/played in planes for and I HATE the Monty Haul stats.  I had a really long<br/>
rant typed out but in the end I deleted because there&#39;s no need to subject<br/>
you all to it. =)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun all and sorry for the novel!<br/>
