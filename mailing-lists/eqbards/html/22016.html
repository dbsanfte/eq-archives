<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194793364">i still get that message.  have gotten it on 52+ mobs and on trying to charm<br/>
myself by accident.  were you trying to charm something that can&#39;t be<br/>
charmed?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; One problem I have with charm is the &quot;This mob is too high level to be<br/>
&gt; charmed&quot;  Or whatever message you used to get no longer is given.  You<br/>
&gt; merely get resisted 100% of the time. </span></blockquote></div>
