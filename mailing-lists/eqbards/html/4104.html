<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443358426">Hiya all,<br/>
Even if its a bit off topic for this NG. I would like to state my oppinion<br/>
too.<br/>
I was aggrivated at first when I saw people running around with very good<br/>
armor and stuff, but after giving it some thought and looking at them<br/>
fight. I really dont feel that way anymore. Sure they have proberly been<br/>
twinked, but along the line mentioned in the post below; I have the feeling<br/>
it dont help them that much? IMO a level 10 player cannot take much<br/>
stronger beasts down just because he have a full set of bronze. Just when I<br/>
look at things going on in Unrest I can see that the people at my level<br/>
running around in Bronze fight the same stuff as me. I also seem to<br/>
remember that there is damage caps on weapon damage versus level, so a<br/>
level 1 char would not get much benefit of using a dirk?<br/>
<br/>
IMO the two real problems with EQ is:<br/>
o Camping<br/>
<br/>
I returned to Crushbone last night and it dident work anyway near it was<br/>
intended, because all the higher level orcs was camped out. and people was<br/>
just standing in line to kill this or that orc. During beta and the first<br/>
month of release I think it worked much better. Permafrost still works<br/>
okay, but it will proberly change as people learn how great a place it is.<br/>
<br/>
o No money drains<br/>
<br/>
I have not yet reached this point myself (50pp in bank wearing mostly<br/>
banded, a combine scimi and a dirk), but it seems ovius to me that EQ&#39;s<br/>
econ. is headed straight hell. The world is getting flooded with items and<br/>
money devaluating the econ very fast. Allmost no money goes back to the<br/>
system, but keeps pouring in to PC&#39;s pockets. I think that Verant has to<br/>
put some kind of money drain in! One thing I see as a possibilty is wearing<br/>
stuff out. I know M59 had this sollution where weapons got worn and would<br/>
eventually break if not mended proberly. The mending could (and should) be<br/>
done by NPC smiths or componts to it should come of npc&#39;s so GM&#39;s could<br/>
control the rate money could be sucked out of the world (we all needs our<br/>
weapons and armor right?). For casters this is allready implemented by the<br/>
use of components, but what about non casters? What do we spend our money<br/>
on (by NPC&#39;s), if we dont want to take up any trade skills...<br/>
I know that Brad have stated that he dont see any problems with it, but I<br/>
sure as hell do.<br/>
<br/>
Ack This got way off topic. Sorry I will move my rambling to another<br/>
place..<br/>

While this is not really barding related - I guess anything that touches<br/>
the virtual world to this extent affects bards as much as anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Now - excuse me while I try to understand these statements.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s understood that twinking is irritating to everyone but the twinkie -<br/>
however that said.....<br/>
<br/>
At 09:38 PM 7/21/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked<br/>
 </span></blockquote>players<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our<br/>
&gt;behinds off for what we have,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>PLEASE explain to me how (unless you are +pvp) what they have has ANY<br/>
bearing on you whatsoever? The &#39;it&#39;s not fair&#39; portion fairly reeks of &quot;I<br/>
didn&#39;t, you can&#39;t&quot;. Right or wrong, this in no way equates to &#39;fair or<br/>
unfair&#39; since this is not a competition. Last I checked - no one got a<br/>
cookie for being first to anything here. My neighbor has a caddie - I drive<br/>
a bug - it&#39;s &#39;not fair&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out<br/>
&gt;in part of the game completely.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s so nice to know that the happiness monitor is paying attention<br/>
and on duty. Really - if THEY are missing out - uhhhhh - is this also any<br/>
of your or my concern? While I happen to believe in your statement myself,<br/>
that is a personal choice - and there is nothing any of us - or Verant for<br/>
that matter can substantially do to stop this short of totally<br/>
restructuring the way things work. Thankfully - unless you are +pvp - it<br/>
removes a huge part of the equation of &#39;affecting others&#39; unfairly or<br/>
adversely.<br/>
<br/>
I felt great when I was able to afford<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that<br/>
&gt;until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces<br/>
&gt;(or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate<br/>
&gt;would I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I<br/>
&gt;play. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them -<br/>
&gt;sure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;not a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making the<br/>
&gt;most out of EQ.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - my story is much the same, most of my contemporaries have moved onto<br/>
bronze, I&#39;m still in banded, and likely will be till rubicite, if I ever<br/>
decide to move on at all. I am under no compunction to ever advance past<br/>
where I am now - some of us are NOT explorer - adventurer types. I&#39;m happy<br/>
that everything in my homeland doesn&#39;t want a piece of me on a stick at<br/>
this point - that was my sole level goal. I look at this more as a world to<br/>
live in - vs a hack and slash to hit 50 on and finish. Matter of fact - I<br/>
spend a LOT of time in town, I just wish &#39;clothing&#39; didn&#39;t look like a<br/>
skimpy one-piece bathing suit on me. I did make it to Qeynos today to get a<br/>
silk evening whachmacalit - the one with +5 charisma - guess what, looks<br/>
like I&#39;m back in my swimsuit top *sigh*. Npc&#39;s can have nice clothes, why<br/>
can&#39;t I?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Twinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that depends - is this their first character? Believe me - after<br/>
playing UO for 2+ years, and EQ now for a few months, newbieness looses<br/>
it&#39;s attraction after you&#39;ve already been there done that. Even if THIS<br/>
character hasn&#39;t - YOU have. Working up thru the lower ranks becomes so<br/>
much repetitive work - and it&#39;s a lot the same for most classes -<br/>
newbieness is newbieness all over Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
Would I give one of my new characters equipment my old had outgrown, hmmm -<br/>
depends what it is. Probably, if it&#39;s nothing outlandish. My husband has a<br/>
habit of &#39;playing&#39; around with a lot of different classes - although I tell<br/>
him when he gets frustrated to wait a bit, all classes are much the same to<br/>
start (i.e., you die a lot) he still does it. I will usually give him a<br/>
suit of patchwork and a real weapon - ewwww....bigtime twink there.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I ever got my hands on the REALLY nice stuff - I&#39;d still pass it<br/>
down, but I&#39;d wait till that character was approaching appropriate level<br/>
for it. Not even for any high moral ground, but because all the twinking in<br/>
the world isn&#39;t gonna keep a lvl 1 from dieing with GREAT regularity. These<br/>
folks that do it before Lvl 5 are really much braver than I. I can see it<br/>
now,<br/>
<br/>
a) Make Newbie<br/>
b) Give Newbie 5 packpacks of armor and weapons<br/>
c) Equip Newbie<br/>
d) Newbie gets his butt handed to him by first bat he sees<br/>

<br/>
WHAT!  Quick, redial, redial - what someone cut an OC LINE! ARRRRRGGGGGHHH!<br/>
WHAT DO YOU MEAN VEESHAN IS DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.<br/>
<br/>
Scratch one very expensive set of equipment.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen enough of these deaths to know that no armor or weapon in the<br/>
game is gonna make up for experience points - YOU IS STILL GONNA DIE - that<br/>
is one thing Verant did very, very well - twinking may be visual, but it<br/>
does NOT makeup for experience points - or knowledge of how things work.</div>
