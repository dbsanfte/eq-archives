<div id="ygrps-yiv-830704519">Why isn&#39;t the group as effective?  Until we start encountering MOBs above level 51, we can break any area<br/>
where we aren&#39;t going to get more than 3 MOBs in a pull (charm MOB 2 against MOB 3).  Even 4 MOB pulls<br/>
aren&#39;t impossible, as long as the group knows to unload on the first one to take it out as fast as<br/>
possible.  Once an area is broken, the MOBs are all single targets, and at that point, what do you need an<br/>
Enchanter for?  In the cases cited, the Enchanter might make the initial break a bit easier (although not in<br/>
all cases), but once beyond that point, the Bard is more generically useful.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, of course, the level 51 limit on Charm, and the lack of a suitable mez above that level.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;If a bard could even keep 3 mezzed it would at least make grouping at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;50+ a bit more fun than having to sit around until an enchanter logged<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;on to go to Sebilis or HS. Once you pass 55 even pickup groups in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Karnors stop being an option as the front mobs turn mostly green.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i&#39;ve been getting pickup groups in sebilis at 53.  we&#39;ve done guardian, zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; in and zone out without enchanters.  i think the jail is also doable without<br/>
&gt; &gt; an enchanter but the only time i was there, we happened to have one. </span></blockquote></div>
