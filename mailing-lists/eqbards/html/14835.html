up with the fleeing giant, he might be able to pull it off.  <br/>
He&#39;s the least likely to die of the bunch, since he can just<br/>
feign.  He also gets mend every 6 minutes, which at 1200 hp<br/>
would equal 300 points.  Dunno if that&#39;ll recycle fast enough<br/>
for him to stay feigned without the giant&#39;s hp being set back<br/>
to full.<br/>
