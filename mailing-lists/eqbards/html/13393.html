<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Getting the exp back is not the problem.  The problem is that<br/>
&gt; most people divide the game into &quot;quality&quot; playtime (fighting<br/>
&gt; mobs, exploring, etc), and &quot;wasted&quot; playtime (traveling,<br/>
&gt; running back to your corpse, waiting for mana/hp to<br/>
&gt; regenerate).<br/>

  I put aside an hour or two each day to sing to all the girls, and<br/>
  tell the tales of Harmonic who single handedly defeated Cazic Thule,<br/>
  how he slashed Maestro with his 6-note blade, how he can solo the Lord<br/>
  Room with his helmet visor down.<br/>
<br/>
  Now that&#39;s quality time.<br/>
