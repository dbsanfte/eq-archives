<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So what you end up with is a bard with a lot of surplus training points.  I<br/>
&gt;put all I could into smithing, as bards make one of the best smiths (STR and<br/>
&gt;DEX are key stats for smiths, and if you smith while singing Chant of Battle<br/>
&gt;and playing your drum, you have much better stats there than most<br/>
&gt;un-augmented races).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I have seen that a players INT seemes to make a MUCH bigger<br/>
difference in smithing.  The skill of the smith seemes to play a larger<br/>
role in how well you can make items.  The people that will gain skill the<br/>
fastest are those with the higher intelligence.  Just try teaching a troll<br/>
a new language as opposed to an Erudite.<br/>
I know a Dark Elf Necromancer Smith that was able to get to 136+ (I say +<br/>
because that was his skill 2 or more weeks ago) skill, in about two weeks<br/>
time.  It cost him about 500 plat in materials to get that good.  Yes he<br/>
was selling the successes as well.  In that short time his skill has<br/>
apparently equaled or surpassed most of those persons on the server that<br/>
have been smithing since well before him.<br/>
<br/>
Str and Dex may help to some degree but if you want to gain skill you need<br/>
int.  I would hazard a guess to say that for someone under between 85 and<br/>
100 int it would probably cost 1000plat to get their skill up that high.<br/>
