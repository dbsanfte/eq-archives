<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470722458">I am headed tonight to get the Icy Greaves from Permafrost. Then to Unrest and Castle Mistmoore for<br/>
the other items.<br/>
<br/>
I am only level 21 but my Invis worked great in Upper Guk. Is the same true for getting to the<br/>
proper room in Permafrost? I know it is not in the undead areas but I have to try them to.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or help on how to acquire these would be great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
