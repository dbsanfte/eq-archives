<div id="ygrps-yiv-218576517">Actually, it DOES stack with thorns type shields, you just have to <br/>
cast it after the thorns.  Some Thorn-type shields will overwrite the <br/>
shield ftom the SS bracer but not the other way around.  With a SS <br/>
Bracer and one of the Damage songs, you can add an easy 18 to a <br/>
Thorns Damage shield.  <br/>

&gt; Bought mine for 4.5kpp on Tarew Marr.  The shield is a 9 pt shield <br/>
that doesn&#39;t stack with thorn type shields, but still stacks with <br/>
ours.  It lasts about 5 minutes (about a fight and a half : ), and <br/>
has about a 5 second casting time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Something I&#39;ve noticed on Bards and using items....&#39;cause we&#39;re <br/>
bards we can activate items while moving etc, but I can&#39;t find a way <br/>
for us to interupt the casting on an item (the others in my guild <br/>
just move, crouch, or sit and it interrupts them...but none of those <br/>
work for us).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, for laughs, go out to third person sometime, and activate an <br/>
illusion mask, then duck while it&#39;s still casting.  You&#39;ll get a very <br/>
interesting look :)<br/>

&gt; #2) I have been thinking about trying to get a SS bracer, but <br/>
really <br/>
&gt; do not want to put the time in the camp. EQ Prices has them listed <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the 2K-2.5K range, but a couple of my friends kinda laughed and <br/>
said <br/>
&gt; I would be looking in the 10K-15K range┬à what is the price of the <br/>
&gt; bracer, and how good are they? (BTW, this is on Xegony.) </span></blockquote></div>
