Hullo all!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on a list of Bardic Hot Buttons to be included in a letter to<br/>
Verant.<br/>
<br/>
These are NOT a demand for fixes, enhancements, or changes to the class or<br/>
to<br/>
the game.  I just want to give Verant a state-of-the-union update on Bards<br/>
in<br/>
general.  Since we seem to be a low-population class, I don&#39;t think we enter<br/>
much into the minds of the developers. I hope this will give them something<br/>
to<br/>
work with.<br/>
<br/>
This list should include a SHORT synopsis of what the issue is, and they<br/>
should<br/>
affect Bards only.  No solutions are needed, as this is not a complaint or<br/>
petition letter.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you see missed items.  Please, no single item/single<br/>
mob<br/>
suggestions.<br/>

-------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
1) Bard Melee Skills<br/>
<br/>
All classes currently get Dodge.  In addition, each hybrid or melee class<br/>
gets 5<br/>
to 7 additional skills.  Bards get one single skill, dual wield.  Since<br/>
Bards<br/>
are usually very popular among the mobs attacking a party, due to party<br/>
buffs<br/>
and healing, the lack of other defensive skills seems odd.  As a side note,<br/>
we<br/>
seem to be Rogue/All Caster hybrids...but Rogues get all melee skills.<br/>
<br/>
2) Mob Hatred<br/>
<br/>
This is tied to number one.  Mobs choose their targets based on perceived<br/>
damage<br/>
to them. Buffs, healing, and taunt count as damage.  This is fine for all<br/>
classes except Bards.  Most non-bard buffing occurs outside of combat, no<br/>
effect<br/>
on mobs.  Most non-bard healing takes place on a single character, less of<br/>
it<br/>
happens on the whole party, tho it does happen with high level clerics.  In<br/>
the<br/>
Bard&#39;s case, during a fight we are generating hate for ALL mobs based on<br/>
buffing/healing ALL characters and doing it every few seconds.  So we get<br/>
maximum hate added to EACH mob, based on helping the whole party. And it<br/>
happens<br/>
with every pulse of every song.  Coupled with a lack of defensive skills,<br/>
this<br/>
makes the life of a party bard pretty difficult.<br/>
<br/>
3) Charm Level Cap<br/>
<br/>
This is a song that we get at level 27, and is only effective on mobs up to<br/>
level 37.  Having spells with caps on most casting classes is<br/>
understandable, as<br/>
they get a higher circle spell that replaces it.  In addition, most casters<br/>
have<br/>
over 100 songs, where we have only 50, once they are all implemented.  The<br/>
charm<br/>
is already difficult to use, I.E. the charm will typically wear off before<br/>
you<br/>
can type a single pet command, and the mob can&#39;t be recharmed till it has<br/>
time<br/>
to smack you.  Does it need a level cap as well?  If this is song is so<br/>
limited,<br/>
perhaps it should be replaced with something else, considering how few songs<br/>
we<br/>
have?<br/>
<br/>
4) Bard Only Weapons<br/>
<br/>
Nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
5) Instrument Skill Caps<br/>
<br/>
Instrument skill caps are the Bardic equivalent of a caster&#39;s Evocation,<br/>
Divination, etc. skills.  All casters cap at 255 in these skills, where<br/>
Bards<br/>
instruments cap at 200.  This leads to many &#39;fizzles&#39; at high level, many<br/>
more<br/>
than an equivalent caster.<br/>
