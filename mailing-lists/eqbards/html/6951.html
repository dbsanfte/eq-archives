<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189207040">I think that party effect would be less realistic.  More convienient for<br/>
sure, but not as roleplayable.  Here is my take.<br/>
<br/>
I think the trade window is the key.  This is how you show items to friends<br/>
anyway, with relative safty.  Make the song so that items in the trade<br/>
window are effected by the song, so that both parties can right click on the<br/>
item and view the lore.  This keeps the skill more personal.  You would not<br/>
have to group with someone to use it on them.  Also, this would allow those<br/>
who wanted to charge for such a service able to do that.  For the record, I<br/>
would never charge for a service like that, its not me(unless they were a<br/>
jerk).  But the ability to charge for the service, and the fact that some<br/>
would charge, will make me look better for not :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I think the party effect is unsavory.<br/>

I have a tough enough time deciding which 8 songs to keep<br/>
memorized as is.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d consider it a good thing<br/>
for some of the &quot;less useful&quot; songs to be made more useful.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I *really* love the idea of making the L14 song<br/>
party-effect. Right now, it&#39;s impossible for non-casters/bards<br/>
to identify no-drop items.  A party-effect identify would let<br/>
Verant kill two birds with one stone (solve the no-drop id<br/>
problem, make the song more useful).<br/>
