&gt; &gt; Doh.  I hit 50 this weekend.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Congrats!!<br/>

just another number to me.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Naw, I&#39;ve been really careful every since 46.  About half my<br/>
deaths since then were to death touches.  Most of the rest<br/>
were to trains where everyone died.  I&#39;ve started scouting the<br/>
area while invis before I enter/pull/fight, using sneak/hide a<br/>
lot, and pre-planning battle plans and escape tactics.  It<br/>
seems to have made a difference.<br/>
