<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079629693">easiest i have found is whoever is pulling for the group, remember his<br/>
function key in your group (f2 through f6).  when he brings the mob back,<br/>
hit his function key then type /as.  all you need is /as, then hit enter and<br/>
you have his target as your target AND you have begun melee attack.<br/>
