<div id="ygrps-yiv-191314926">I believe your formula is correct in a general sense.  However, I have heard<br/>
that the skill cap formula you listed does not apply to every skill.  From<br/>
what I have read, it mainly applies to combat skills, magic skills, and for<br/>
a bard, singing/instrument skills<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think trade skills are affected by your level whatsoever.  In<br/>
theory, you could have a first level character with a Master rating in a<br/>
trade skill.  I have heard of players in guilds doing this.  One guild<br/>
member creates a character who will do nothing in the game but practice one<br/>
particular trade.  Other guild members continue feeding money into this<br/>
character so he builds his trade skill up.  In this way, guild members can<br/>
get items at a discount rate/free without having to spend their own playing<br/>
time building up their trade skills. <br/>
<br/>
I have also seen posts from this list that state bards, as well as other<br/>
classes, have a class ceiling on certain skills.  I don&#39;t know for certain<br/>
which skills this applies to or what the ceiling is.  I would be interested<br/>
to see this list once the correct information is known.<br/>

&gt; Just to get everyone clear on the subject, your skill cap is <br/>
&gt; 5 Times your Level, +5<br/>
&gt; So, say your 10th level, your skill cap will be 55<br/>
&gt; 10*5=50+5=55<br/>
