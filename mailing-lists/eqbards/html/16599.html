<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140210193">Funny you should mention that Pied Piper thing.  I was thinking it<br/>
would be neat if we had some sort of song that would enable us to<br/>
entice creatures to follow us and not aggro.  They would be so<br/>
entranced by the song, that they would just merrily follow along.<br/>

&gt; hmm...i am sure everyone will have lots of good ideas....let me<br/>
throw out some<br/>
&gt; ideas for possible new songs:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  A Stun.  This would be awesome...but most likely broken since<br/>
we need no<br/>
&gt; mana.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  this one is a little bizarre..dunno if they can do it...a group<br/>
Damage<br/>
&gt; Shield that has a 2ndary effect (example: a Lightning-based Damage<br/>
shield<br/>
&gt; [shield of static? &lt;grin&gt;] that does X damage and the attacker has<br/>
to save or<br/>
&gt; be stunned for 3 sec or something.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...i am big on the idea of a stun...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  Bards need a party buff that directly adds to attack (ala grim<br/>
aura, fire<br/>
&gt; fists)  .  Probably would do other stuff too...dunno how to present<br/>
that as a<br/>
&gt; viable idea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.  we&#39;re missing the 39 song?  How about a self-only vampiric<br/>
regeneration<br/>
&gt; song...where heal like 10% of the damage we do( in melee).  dunno<br/>
what the<br/>
&gt; efficiency would have to be to make the song useable...John(tm)?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5.  Really bizarre...a flute based song...that summons a pet<br/>
(preferably a<br/>
&gt; giant rat) that should be a reasonable power level (like the shaman<br/>
pet...12+<br/>
&gt; levels behind shaman)  You could balance this by: making the song<br/>
have to be<br/>
&gt; running continuous, with a 5 min repop on the button.  Or, have it<br/>
drain mana<br/>
&gt; (like the shaman spell frenzy) and die when bard is at 0 mana.<br/>
&gt; ...i was shooting for a pied piper type thing here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6.  I want an upgraded AE mez...with a built in DOT. &lt;Grin&gt;  It<br/>
drops the dot,<br/>
&gt; and then they have to make their Mez save...ok this one is<br/>
stupid...but it<br/>
&gt; sounded good before my morning coffee.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kaleid<br/>
&gt; 23rd song Half elf bard<br/>
&gt; Glyphed Aegiss<br/>
&gt; 27th level Dark Elf Magician and slayer of Travis Two Tone<br/>
&gt; (up to apprehensive in mistmoore...if i remember correctly)<br/>
&gt; &lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>
&gt; Prexus<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS. In reference to the mage-pet-root thread, we practically have 3<br/>
pets...the<br/>
&gt; air pet is horrendously awful.  No earth pet is the rule when there<br/>
is a<br/>
&gt; neccesity for snare.  This does become complicated if the pet is<br/>
the primary<br/>
&gt; tank...because the earth pet has 1.5X the hit points of the water<br/>
pet and<br/>
&gt; probably 2.5X the fire pet.   But the general rule is to not use<br/>
earth in<br/>
&gt; dungeons at all, or when snare is being cast...any magician should<br/>
follow this<br/>
&gt; rule...the earth pet is the &quot;soloing&quot; pet basically.<br/>

&gt; &quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>
&gt; adultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has<br/>
spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart<br/>
everybody?&quot;<br/>
