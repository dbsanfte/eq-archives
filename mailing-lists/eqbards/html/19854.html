<b>Subject:</b> Bard Training in Kunark <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-414417674">I have only made about three trips to Kunark now.  The first two were just a<br/>
disaster but this third trip was great.  I manage to hit level 17 and<br/>
screamed back to FV to train dual wield.  After a bit of looking around I<br/>
asked if there was a bard trainer.  Nope :(  I had to go back to the main<br/>
land to train - which I did... I have been wanting dual wield for days......<br/>
Just curious - are bards the only guild that do not have a trainer there?  I<br/>
saw many other trainers along the way and even someone to sell songs....<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say I love Kunark!  I have been grouped in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
and loved it.  It&#39;s a harsh place but once you get settled in you don&#39;t want<br/>
to leave - half the reason I am miffed as to there being no trainer<br/>
there....<br/>
