&gt;&gt; i love my lvl 15 bard but when i comes to dishing out<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage in a battle i am weak.  I know the bard class is<br/>
&gt;&gt; not designed to be a warrior, but for example, i bought a<br/>
&gt;&gt; mino axe at lvl 9, i still dishes the same amount of<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage now at lvl 15 as it did at lvl 9 except for the<br/>
&gt;&gt; below song and it only does 8 damage.<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re that bad off at melee.  We use the same<br/>
&gt;weapon as a warrior/ranger/paladin.  With the Whistling<br/>
&gt;Warsong, you get a 15%-20% attack speedup based on research I<br/>
&gt;and someone else have done.  That btw is more than the<br/>
&gt;difference between a combine longsword and a well-balanced<br/>
&gt;longsword, and is like hitting for about 3 extra points damage<br/>
&gt;with a 17 point hit from a minotaur axe.  The same song also<br/>
&gt;buffs our str and AC.  Our bellow takes the place of a kick.  <br/>
&gt;And at L17 we get dual wield.  Our melee skills are weaker<br/>
&gt;than the melee classes, but IMHO the difference is only just<br/>
&gt;starting to become apparent at L17.  (The biggest difference I<br/>
&gt;see is with my warrior friend, but he has double attack as<br/>
&gt;well).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The way I see it, we are (as in so many things) better than some,<br/>
worse than others.  In melee we are out done (damage wise) by<br/>
warriors, monks, rangers, rogues, paladins and shadow knights <br/>
(no particular order), but we out do clerics, druids, shamans and<br/>
the 4 mage classes.  Right in the middle.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing some people on the a.g.eq newsgroup don&#39;t seem to <br/>
accept is that, while we can do many things, there is always<br/>
somebody (or many bodys) who can do a given thing better.<br/>
