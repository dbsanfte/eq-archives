Just by a piece of leather  or<br/>

about 2pp per piece, or less with quantity, is within reach of the<br/>
low level players.<br/>
The fact that several pieces of armour are not available in patchwork<br/>
means you should do both IMHO.  Buy the patchwork (or make it) at a<br/>
lower level, and upgrade as you can affort it, purchasing those<br/>
pieces that aren&#39;t available as patchwork first.  I see no point<br/>
in shelling out for a leather tunic when you have a patchwork tunic,<br/>
but no shoulder pads or face mask.  Sure, a tunic has higher AC, but<br/>
I think that a patchwork tunic plus another piece of leather (or two)<br/>
would have higher AC than the leather tunic alone.<br/>
