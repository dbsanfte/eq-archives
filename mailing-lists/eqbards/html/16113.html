<br/>
Since they gave both dragons AE debuffs, no dragon raid on Brell will be <br/>
attempted without at least 2 bards.  Several tanks won&#39;t raid a dragon <br/>
unless they are grouped with a bard.<br/>
<br/>
You talk about nerfs, but they have not touched the songs used when raiding <br/>
dragons.  A raid may still be successful without bards, but I guarantee you <br/>
there would be a lot of unnecessary deaths because some nimrod raid leader <br/>
decided to exclude bards.<br/>

&gt;Yeah, as I said in my last message, this is just what some members of my <br/>
&gt;guild are arguing for Dragon<br/>
&gt;raids.  No Bards.  And even with six bards in the guild level 45 and up, <br/>
&gt;we&#39;re having a hard time arguing<br/>
&gt;the point.  We&#39;re *supposed* to be the most powerful *grouping* class in <br/>
&gt;the game, but our songs have been<br/>
&gt;nerfed to the point where, even in a *full* group, someone else does it <br/>
&gt;better.  Have you seen the<br/>
&gt;discussions on other boards where people are asked to list their ideal <br/>
&gt;parties, or the player type they<br/>
&gt;would choose to group with first?  If we&#39;re the best grouping class, we <br/>
&gt;should be way up on those lists,<br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t we?  Instead, most people out there don&#39;t even put bards down as <br/>
&gt;an alternate for the sixth<br/>
&gt;slot!  I&#39;m getting a complex.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t feel we are keeping balanced with other classes, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;   until we claim that - Verant will not see a problem.  Everquest is<br/>
&gt; &gt;   turning toward a cleric + warrior game, strategies/abilities/spells or<br/>
&gt; &gt;   songs are really not meaningful in that scenario.  When a group of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   people hunting gods, dragons, etc can say &#39;We really don&#39;t need a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt;   for this.&#39;, &#39;We need better tanks, and better healing, bards will just<br/>
&gt; &gt;   lag us.&#39;, &#39;I would rather have a warrior with decent gear instead of a<br/>
&gt; &gt;   bard.&#39; - something is seriously wrong balance-wise.<br/>
