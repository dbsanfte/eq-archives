<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056921301">Mana Sieving Vox does help... all the tanks pushing her one direction <br/>
can&#39;t hurt as well. :)  I&#39;ve only fought her once (and even then, I <br/>
just watched thru Bind Sight, hehe), but I&#39;ve read up on her lots.  <br/>
My scale came off Vox and she went down the first attempt, but I <br/>
understand (and from what other Bards here posted) that&#39;s not the <br/>
norm.  We had a great leader for our raid (I&#39;m not talking about me, <br/>
hehe) and everyone thankfully listened and did their job (after <br/>
aggroing about 6 IG&#39;s at the beginning).<br/>
<br/>
Bard Trak is identical in Level, Str, and Abilities as the normal <br/>
Trak, but he is not buffed by Jumpy, which makes him easier to kill.  <br/>
He drops 1 Kunark BP and the Trak Guts.  No other loot, not even <br/>
spells when we killed him.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else asked about Phin still being a gimp... Phin can be <br/>
single pulled to the ledge by a Level 60, so he&#39;s just a little more <br/>
work (having to swim to his lair) than before the change... It&#39;s <br/>
probably faster to swim to him, pull him and swim/gate out than it <br/>
was to get the eye thing to work anyway. :)<br/>

times I was along.<br/>

and power, but I have not fought him personally. </span></blockquote></div>
