<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035739126">Sorry this is off topic, but I know this is an active list and need a quick<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
My level 14 rogue is engaged in a virtual duel via email with a level 45<br/>
wizard.  She&#39;s not out to kill me, just to get an item back.  Currently I&#39;m<br/>
immobilized and she&#39;s sitting a little ways in front of me medding.<br/>
<br/>
My thought was to shoot an arrow and a skeleton that just spawned behind<br/>
her, then evade and hope that it would attack the medding 45 wizard in it&#39;s<br/>
path before continuing on to me.  (I want it to stun her so I can flee<br/>
before she gets another root off)<br/>
<br/>
What are the chances something like this would work in-game?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
