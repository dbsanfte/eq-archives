<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103650384">There are lots of drawbacks to the way you suggest though. First, if it<br/>
was like devine aura, you&#39;d have to wait that 15-30 min after loading<br/>
the song before playing it. However, if they had made it grey out the<br/>
slot but have a fast load time, you could have unmemorized the song and<br/>
rememorized it to reset it. Basically they way they did it was the best<br/>
way for what they wanted, other than making a hidden mana like counter<br/>
that worked the same. However, IMO, it was still a waste of time because<br/>
as others have pointed out, the song is way underpowered for the hassle<br/>
it involves. They may as well have made the song make the bard blow up,<br/>
killing everything around him, for all the good it usually does.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; And short but sweet, I agree with Kevin.  I don&#39;t want all our songs<br/>
&gt; mana-based.  It doesn&#39;t fit how bards work.  I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t like the<br/>
&gt; song ideas and think our new songs will be as good as they should be, I just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to rely on mana to be able to do sing them.  I think Dirge should<br/>
&gt; have had a timer reset like LH, HT, or DA instead of using our mana.  When<br/>
&gt; they implemented the song, GZ said he only used mana to limit how often we<br/>
&gt; used it.  It was not really a mana-based song, they just used mana as a<br/>
&gt; timer instead of doing it the right way (couldn&#39;t they keep the song slot<br/>
&gt; grayed out like divine aura until they wanted us to use it again?).  And if<br/>
&gt; they did that right, we wouldn&#39;t even be talking about songs using mana<br/>
&gt; right now cause it never would have happened and we never would have thought<br/>
&gt; of it.  Dammit that wasn&#39;t short or sweet =)<br/>
