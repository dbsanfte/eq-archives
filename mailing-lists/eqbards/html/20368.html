<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531553777">Most memorable/fun/experience-getting group I&#39;ve been in lately:<br/>
<br/>
Bard (me)<br/>
Necro<br/>
Necro<br/>
Necro<br/>
Magician<br/>
Wizard<br/>
<br/>
I was level 45, others were all level 40-41, in OOT.  Pulled constantly, <br/>
including Quag.  Gotta love four pets tanking.  Even with no healer in <br/>
the group, I rarely had to break out the lute.<br/>
