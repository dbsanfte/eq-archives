<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135852469"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just reached level 12, and now the things I used to hunt in Steamfront all con green. Where should<br/>
I go from here? I could stay here and kill mino&#39;s, but they&#39;re too hard to find (camped most of the<br/>
time). Where should I go from here? What&#39;s good for level 12? Any help is greatly appreciated.<br/>

May I HIGHLY recommend soloing the aquagoblins on the rocks just inside the Ocean of Tears from<br/>
Butcherblock (not on the spires which I suspect are a deathtrap from falling). Jump off the boat and<br/>
climb up on the rock that has the two Alluring Sirens. There are two aquagoblins on that rock and<br/>
another close by with 3 on it. Destroy any rusty weapons and fill your pack with bows (2gp each from<br/>
the High elf at BB dock if you charm him).  Great exp, good loot and great fun.To get back on the<br/>
boat swim towords it when it is coming at you, angle up and you will pop up inside.<br/>
<br/>
Once you hit 13 may I then suggest wisps in Erudes crossing (assuming you have a magic weapon) for<br/>
total tedium but GREAT money and exp, exploring Kithicor for fun and danger (good exp, little<br/>
money),  go back to wack gnoll commanders in Blackbullow :o) for being such bullies when you were<br/>
weaker.<br/>
<br/>
At 14 try Lavastorm! Woooo what a blast. I am soloing there now (hit 15 last night). As bards here<br/>
is the tip: blue Firedrakes and Stone Dervishes (maybe rock bascilisks) GOOD, blue and even kinda<br/>
green Fire Elems BAD. Blue Fire Elems will kick your butt into next tuesday. Same for Rock Crawlers.<br/>
I am guessing that Feerot might be good to solo now too.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, I like to travel *smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Now if I can just find a brigandine tunic...*sigh*<br/>
