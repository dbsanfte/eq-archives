<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982920003">Fear not Galtin.  There are often clerics of high level in Runnyeye and<br/>
sufficient pleading should get you rezz&#39;d.  I had a similar thing happen to<br/>
me and got three rez offers from clerics glad to make a bard friend so they<br/>
could get TO their corpses sometime to rez themselves.  Also, if you made it<br/>
to 5 feet from the border, how come the other guys couldn&#39;t get to their<br/>
corpses?  That&#39;s how I did this the one time I had to.  My friends waited on<br/>
the othe path to the center path and when I ran out and turned one way they<br/>
slipped in from the other way.  I died at the two boulders by the runnyeye<br/>
entrance but they snuck in grabbed their corpses and dragged them to the<br/>
Karana zone border.  You did much far beyond the call of duty I hope you<br/>
find clerics as sympathetic as I did.<br/>

Attaining 23d level was short lived for me:-(.  Here is what happened.<br/>
Would like to hear what some of you would have done in my shoes.<br/>
<br/>
After getting great XP the past two nights fighting evil eyes in Beholder<br/>
with relative ease (plus gaining 23d level), I adventured there again last<br/>
night.  The previous two nights, I had been grouped with a 22d level<br/>
paladin.  At times other parties were camping the place where the evil eyes<br/>
and named Lords spawn but after those parties left the paladin and I were<br/>
still able to hold our own.  The evil eye spawns were staggered on each side<br/>
of the rock so we had time to med/heal in between combats plus kill the<br/>
green/blue minos that also spawn nearby.  Basically we were very efficient.<br/>
<br/>
Last night when I logged on late there was only me (23 bard at the time) and<br/>
a 25 warrior in the zone.  We teamed up and headed to the evil eye spawn<br/>
site.  As we moved down the path that leads to the evil eye spawn, green<br/>
minos started attacking us.  These were tougher than normal because<br/>
apparently the evil eyes buffed them with all kinds of enchanter spells.  We<br/>
killed them all but had to heal before going down to the gorge.  A 19<br/>
paladin soon joined the party and I assumed that with three of us things<br/>
would be much easier.  <br/>
<br/>
The three of us made our way down to the gorge with me singing the invis<br/>
song.  This tactic didn&#39;t work because the evil eyes had buffed the minos<br/>
with See Invis.  Once again we got jumped but were able to kill the minos.<br/>
We then made our way to the gorge and healed up before attacking the eyes.<br/>
There was an eye and a Lord on each side of the rock.  We went after the<br/>
Lord first.  I weaved Guardian and Elemental with drum equipped and let the<br/>
two fighters tank.  Not 10 seconds into the combat, all hell broke loose.<br/>
Tons of minos and muddites appeared out of nowhere.  I got stunned and was<br/>
unable to keep the resist songs up.  Eventually all three of us were slammed<br/>
with spells.  Charm, Darkness, Whirl, etc.  Basically the entire enchanter<br/>
spell list got dumped on us.  The other two parties members died and I was<br/>
able to zone out with less than 50HP remaining.<br/>
<br/>
I knew it would almost be impossible for just the three of us to<br/>
successfully camp the evil eye spawn site.  All we wanted to do was retrieve<br/>
their corpses and get out of there.  Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t go in Invis<br/>
because everything could see us due to the eyes buffing the minos with See<br/>
Invis.  <br/>
<br/>
Here was my quandry and what I would like feedback on.  I told them that in<br/>
my opinion I didn&#39;t think that the three of us, me the only one with all my<br/>
gear, could successfully retrieve their corspes.  They had died while under<br/>
charm and didn&#39;t even know exactly where their corpses where.  It was very<br/>
late, after midnight Hawaii time.  I suggested they wait until tomorrow when<br/>
more people were online and the zone was much safer.  They pleaded with me<br/>
to help them.  Knowing what it feels like to be in that situation, I decided<br/>
to forgo common survivability sense and helped them get their corpses.<br/>
<br/>
I told them I would run down into the gorge and get everythings attention<br/>
and then lead everything to a zone.  Hopefully, that would clear the area<br/>
and they could go in and use /corpse to pull their corpses back to a safe<br/>
location.  Not the best plan but with Selos and my resist songs I thought we<br/>
had a chance.  The first time I tried running to the Runnyeye zone.  I died<br/>
about 5 feet from the border.  Second time I never made it out of the gorge.<br/>
To rub salt in the wound, neither one of them was able to loot their corpse,<br/>
I went back to 22d level, and now my corspe is back in the gorge (had to<br/>
camp because it was late and I wasn&#39;t gonna try again).  <br/>
<br/>
What would you guys have done in my shoes?  I didn&#39;t want the guys to think<br/>
I was bugging out on them by not helping them get their corpse.  If someone<br/>
did that to me, I would probably never group with them again.  I felt like I<br/>
was stuck between a rock and a hard place.<br/>
<br/>
This pain would be lessened if I could get resurrected.  However, there are<br/>
no clerics in my guild high enough to cast the spell so I would have to get<br/>
assistance from someone who doesn&#39;t know me.  Anyone have a suggestion on<br/>
what I should offer (money/items) that would be worth their time to stop<br/>
whatever they are doing and help me out?   <br/>
<br/>
To all those who subscribe to the digest, I apologize for the extremely long<br/>
