<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023616263">Simply put, having done the math via /log Psalm does less damage than<br/>
Chords, far less.  Largo&#39;s is useful and I do use it sometimes.  Screech is<br/>
only good for running away when in a group.  Again, Chains does not stack<br/>
with Largo&#39;s whcih I do use sometimes, as I said before, and it breaks Snare<br/>
so Largo&#39;s is a better option when in a group.  So much better in fact that<br/>
there is no choice.  Also, if there is an enchanter, my slowing one mob with<br/>
Largo&#39;s is not as effective as using Chant.  Maybe it will be at some point<br/>
later, but not at 31.  The only really good thing about Psalm is it doesn&#39;t<br/>
get resisted, so when fighting reds it can be useful.<br/>

&gt;Yeah I made it all the way to 31.  Too bad I have a life.  My fleibility is<br/>
&gt;nowhere what it was at level 18 even.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>really?  you mean you never use ae slow, or chains, or damage shields, or<br/>
fear, or charm?  these songs allow you to crowd control, reduce attackers<br/>
speed, cause extra damage, fear/kite outdoors, etc.  and this is LESS<br/>
flexibility<br/>
than at 18????<br/>
<br/>

&gt;is useless if there&#39;s an enchanter in the group, and since they are so<br/>
&gt;necessary there nearly always is, especially with 3 in my group of<br/>
&gt;guildmates/friends.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i&#39;ve also seen other bards post hard data showing that they didn&#39;t have as<br/>
many problems either.  psalm never useful enough?  well you just posted<br/>
that you normally group with enchanters and snarers, so what&#39;s wrong with<br/>
twisting hymn, psalm, chant of battle?  maybe hymn, psalm, fufil&#39;s for the<br/>
MR debuff and minor damage.  the whole point of being a bard is to fill in<br/>
the<br/>
gaps in a 6 person group.  if you&#39;re always grouped with enchanter, cleric,<br/>
AND<br/>
snarer, then of course you won&#39;t have as much you have to do.  most of us<br/>
aren&#39;t that lucky, even at the higher levels.  fear might be suicide in<br/>
dungeons,<br/>
but what about fear kiting in overthere or lake of ill omen?  or dreadlands<br/>
out<br/>
by karnors?  at higher levels you can fear kite in burning woods and<br/>
skyfire.<br/>
and yes, i mean in a group, not solo.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;tactical option is deleted or made unusable.  I never Chain unless alone<br/>
&gt; &gt;snare is now far better and only level 1!  I never Lullaby unless it&#39;s to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;you never chain unless alone?  maybe you just don&#39;t understand the<br/>
&gt;flexibility<br/>
&gt; &gt;of a bard then.<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s a good one.  that your best debating technique?  I do understand the<br/>
&gt;flexibility and 12 seconds of inferior snaring is nowhere near as good as a<br/>
&gt;first level druid or ninth level ranger spell, SNARE.  Not even close.  It<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t stack with Largo&#39;s and Largo&#39;s doesn&#39;t break Snare like it does.  I<br/>
&gt;cannot remember the last time I was in a group without a ranger or a druid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hmm, my last 3 groups in sebilis didn&#39;t have a ranger or druid. in one of<br/>
them<br/>
i was actually the main snarer.  we never had one get away, even with some<br/>
resists.  and before you point out kaearia&#39;s numbers on that, i was the one<br/>
who<br/>
found an error with his numbers and the revised numbers were nowhere near<br/>
as bad as the first ones he posted.<br/>

&gt;you<br/>

&gt;Generally I don&#39;t use a wind instrument since it makes zero difference on<br/>
&gt;the resist rate, as tested extensively by myself and John Kim.  My charisma<br/>
&gt;can be 153 or 119 depending on gear.  I liked doing more than just laying<br/>
&gt;DoT&#39;s with instruments and playing Hymn.<br/>

&gt; &gt;existed.  If bards were so powerful, how come we&#39;ve always been among the<br/>
&gt; &gt;rarest classes in a game that&#39;s all about power???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;because our power is nicely masked.  you have to be a good player and<br/>
&gt;understand<br/>
&gt; &gt;a lot about our songs and the way the game works and other classes before<br/>
&gt;you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;be that superpowerful bard.  most people either don&#39;t stick with it long<br/>
&gt;enough or <br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t have enough knowledge to really master the bard class.<br/>
