&gt;   I should have clarified this more.  Healing 12-14 points is<br/>
&gt;   with the lute in hand.  The dmg shield provided from Psalm<br/>
&gt;   still allows the bard to fight with his weapons.  Without<br/>
&gt;   the lute 6-7 points of healing occurs.  (these numbers based<br/>
&gt;   on a L35ish bard, as we were focusing on) The dmg shield nor<br/>
&gt;   healing will provide sufficient worth if all members are not<br/>
&gt;   being engaged.  Otherwise you end up healing one person, while<br/>
&gt;   everyone else is at max health, or you dmg shield everyone but<br/>
&gt;   the mob is only attacking one person.  Whether you do direct<br/>

is per party member.  If you&#39;re facing one mob, the damage<br/>
shield (7-8 points) is going to be activated 0-4 times every 3<br/>
seconds (figure 2 average).  So over 6 seconds, the damage<br/>
shield will do up to 64 points damage (32 average).  If all<br/>
your party members are wounded, Hymn is going to do (6-7)*6 =<br/>
36-42 points healing every 6 seconds.  If you switch to a<br/>
lute, healing 6 people at once easily outdoes the damage a<br/>
shield would do against a mob quad-attacking every 3 seconds.<br/>
So it really depends on the situation.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Incidently, this is why I started playing with the Chant songs<br/>
lately (they stack).  They seemed to do (16-18)*3 damage each<br/>
to a mob per application.  That&#39;s roughly on par with the<br/>
damage I do with my weapons per Chant.  I didn&#39;t feel I was<br/>
losing much offensive power putting away my weapons and<br/>
sticking with instruments + Chant of Flame.  Especially in<br/>
light of the druid tossing out Starfires like there was no<br/>
tomorrow (1-2 per mob, about 30 seconds downtime between mobs)<br/>
with Clarity plus manastone plus Hymn on my lute.  :)<br/>

&gt;   serious heat from using Hymm, and that was my original point.<br/>
<br/>

Another thing I&#39;ve noticed is that my friends have gotten<br/>
really really good at pulling singles (level, lull, harmony,<br/>
feign, etc).  When we get multiples, they&#39;re usually<br/>
mesmerized, or I can control them easily enough.<br/>
