<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964726470"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Another reason not to snare at the beginning is dispels.  A<br/>
&gt;lot of high level casting mobs tend to buff themselves to the<br/>
&gt;hilt.  I haven&#39;t tested this formally, but dispel seems to<br/>
&gt;dispel things you haven&#39;t cast.  Since it&#39;s usually an<br/>
&gt;enchanter doing mass dispels, that means you&#39;re snare will be<br/>
&gt;gone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, you can dispell spells YOU cast as well.<br/>
As I learned to my horror when I snared a mob then<br/>
set forth to Cancel the damage shield on the mob...<br/>
<br/>
Since, I cancel magic the damage shield, THEN snare :)<br/>
<br/>
Nice thing about bard songs -- they come back after dispells.<br/>
(Some of the spells that monsters cast have a side effect<br/>
of dispelling. When the Mistmoore castle is loaded out into the <br/>
courtyard, I am constantly re-casting SoW onto our puller as if<br/>
she gets hit by one of the casters, SoW invariably falls first.<br/>
Skin like Rock is usually the second. But not as necessary to <br/>
recast immediately if we&#39;re in a low mana situation.)</div>
