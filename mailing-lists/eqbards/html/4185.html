&gt;&gt; Yup it works quite well, be a bit careful with weapons as <br/>
&gt;&gt; humanoid types (orcs, skeletons, etc) will wield those<br/>
&gt;&gt; weapons as well.  Of course it would be kinda funny to see<br/>
&gt;&gt; a skeleton with a BIBS :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was thinking more along the lines of a lucky fire beetle with a<br/>
&gt;lightstone, or maybe a bat with a nice gem in their belly or something. A<br/>
&gt;snake with a rusty sword or spear would be kind of odd I think..  :)<br/>

orc pawn scalp as loot.  My immediate comment to the zone<br/>
&quot;Hey, this snake had a orc pawn scalp on it!  Do you suppose<br/>
he ate a pawn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Got at least 5 laughs out of that one :)</div>
