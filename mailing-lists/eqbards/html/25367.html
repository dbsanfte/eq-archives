<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092196951">Have to agree, but let&#39;s move beyond the debate of Bard&#39;s current<br/>
usefulness in Raids and come up with a couple ideas on how they could be<br/>
improved without overpowering them too much.<br/>
<br/>
Stacking OOS might be a little extreme :), but there&#39;s got to be some good<br/>
ideas we can come up with.<br/>
<br/>
* A stackable slow song like Erjav?<br/>
* A targeted, stackable Rune song ala SOS?<br/>
* More debuff songs ala OOS but for CR, FR, etc.<br/>
* A song that refreshes your groups disciplines faster<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it off the top of my head,<br/>

Well Dark you wouldn&#39;t being experiencing anything if you weren&#39;t on the<br/>
raid. And if you weren&#39;t on the raid, the raid wouldn&#39;t be noticing<br/>
anything different either. You need, &quot;need&quot; not want, 1 bard on a raid.<br/>
<br/>
Any more bards would be better replaced by another class.<br/>
