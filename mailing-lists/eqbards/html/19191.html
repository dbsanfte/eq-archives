<div id="ygrps-yiv-906001910">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
This guy just gave me a Giant Grub Digger (12dam/47dly, +20HP, +5 <br/>
SVDisease), *2HS* weapon that can be wielded by bards!  Now, last <br/>
time I visited the Bard Guild, my trainer didn&#39;t offer me 2hs as a <br/>
skill, and I&#39;ve always heard that 2HS is not available to bards <br/>
anyway, YET I can and have wielded this thing!  In truth, using this <br/>
is not as effective as my Drachnid Leg Tip, but I think it&#39;s because <br/>
Bards are NOT ABLE to increase their 2HS skill.  Also, the only time <br/>
I do any REAL damage (25-28 per hit!) is when I&#39;m whistling the war <br/>
song, otherwise I rarely hit above 10.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any information on this?  Have any bards been able <br/>
to establish and improve a 2HS skill?  If so, bards just got a GREAT <br/>
soloing weapon!<br/>
