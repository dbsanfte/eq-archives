<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562598654">The delay of a weapon is the tenths of a second taken to use it.  So a Mino<br/>
Axe, delay 38, should strike every 3.8 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to verify these numbers, time the amount of time needed for 10<br/>
strikes.  Should be right around 38 secs for the mino axe.<br/>
<br/>
Anthem is rumored to reduce the delay by 10%.  So the mino axe will strike<br/>
every 3.42 seconds with Anthem.<br/>
