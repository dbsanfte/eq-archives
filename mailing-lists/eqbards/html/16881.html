that will likely kill you before your group can finish the<br/>
other target(s), then just don&#39;t bother singing any songs.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s happening is that every time your party buff song(s)<br/>
pulses, every mob in the area registers it and bumps you up on<br/>
their hate list.  Since the puller hasn&#39;t likely done much<br/>
damage, you will immediately surpass him on the hate list and<br/>
the mob will attack you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, I never found much way to avoid it between<br/>
about L10-16.  I played around with starting my songs later in<br/>
the fight at L12-14, and basically, unless I started my songs<br/>
5 seconds before the mobs died, they&#39;d aggro on me.  The<br/>
problem starts to go away in your low 20s, as the other<br/>
classes damage/taunt abilities surpass ours.<br/>
<br/>
Find some good clerics and try to stick with them.  They will<br/>
actually appreciate you for having this problem because it&#39;ll<br/>
keep the mobs off them, and they&#39;ll only have to heal one<br/>
person.  You&#39;ll also find it handy having lots of cleric<br/>
friends when you reach level 29+ for their res spells.<br/>
