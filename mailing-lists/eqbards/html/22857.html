<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-281061084">When bard skill caps were maxxed at 200, I was able to max out my wind skill<br/>
by firing up the invis song and going AFK in a safe spot.  Unlike raising<br/>
brass skill, maxxing out my wind skill each level went by fairly quickly.  I<br/>
could go AFK for 15 minutes or so and I would get the 5 skill point<br/>
increases.  After the skill caps were raised, my Singing, String, and<br/>
Percussion skills were easily maxxed thru normal playing with songs like<br/>
Selos and Hymn.  However, not once has my Wind skill gone up while using<br/>
Invis song.  It is still at 200 while my singing, percussion and lute are<br/>
all around 230.  I haven&#39;t bothered with Brass skill lately since its too<br/>
much of a hassle to go to the Arena in Lake Rathe plus I rarely use any of<br/>
the songs that are enhanced by brass instruments.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else been able to get their wind skill over 200 just using Invis<br/>
song?<br/>
