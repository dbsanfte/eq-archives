&gt;how hard is the Dreadlands charming game.  The dreadlands seems pretty<br/>
&gt;crowded with hostiles, which is both an advantage and disadvantage when<br/>
&gt;charming for obvious reasons.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I started hunting in Dreadlands at level 39. At this level I explored <br/>
around and tried hunting in different spots and have come to the conclusion <br/>
that at 39-40th level, best hunting areas are the snowy lands. I have 3 <br/>
spots that I like to hunt in.<br/>
<br/>
1) Coming out of the tunnel from the wizard spire/druid ring area. After <br/>
you come out, to the right is a nice flat shelf area. Usually has only 1 or <br/>
2 roamers. If there&#39;s only 1 mob here, I go and chant another and bring him <br/>
over to fight. I never tried the other side of the tunnel as I like this <br/>
flat spot too much.<br/>
<br/>
2) Giant fort.  If you are at the front gates to the giant fort, to the <br/>
north over a hill is a nice wide flat valley which has another wide bowl <br/>
attached to it farther north. There are a couple of giants that roam <br/>
through here, but that&#39;s a good thing. There&#39;s usually 2 close enough to <br/>
start the whole charming game. There&#39;s various drolvargs and spiders that <br/>
walk along the edges and rarely do they come into this valley. If they do, <br/>
and I just want to keep the 2 giants I have fighting each other, I head <br/>
north and have them fight in the bowl area, as nothing seems to ever roam <br/>
into here. I pretty much fight in these two areas about 75% of the time now.<br/>
<br/>
3) Giant &quot;Lean To&quot; (tunnel). To the west of the giant fort in a little <br/>
valley, is a shack that usually has 1 giant around it. I pull him and have <br/>
him kill things that roam this valley. It&#39;s nice and wide. To the North is <br/>
another valley which is inhabited by a lot of creatures and has a ton of <br/>
wanderers. I pull them back to this area to have them fight each other.<br/>
<br/>
I like these areas as I usually can get away with using my level 27 charm <br/>
song and not use any mana. The steeps and drolvarg ragers tend to too high <br/>
for that though, and I resort to my level 39 song. I only use at most a <br/>
bubble of mana for a session, so I suppose I could use it exclusively, but <br/>
I feel I like to have the extra mana.<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
For those who aren&#39;t in the 39th level range, and you feel the urge to <br/>
charm, I recommend hill giants in rathe mountains. Also I did some soloing <br/>
in Sol A and still got exp from the bar, but found that extremely <br/>
difficult. Stay behind the bar and keep your target chained. Expect to have <br/>
to run at times (or employ a recently posted trick which I hope doesn&#39;t get <br/>
nerfed).<br/>
<br/>
Also, tried soloing the jail in Mistmoore, which isn&#39;t too bad since the <br/>
things in the cells are chained and you can just chant to death, but I had <br/>
my share of deaths there as well. Was best with a partner, and it&#39;s hard to <br/>
find one who is about your level on my server. Fortunately, the jail was <br/>
rarely camped, but the biggest problem is, if you can&#39;t find a partner, <br/>
what else are you going to do on Faydwer? *shrug*.<br/>
<br/>
I did like lower guk as well as naggies lair, but since I&#39;m a part time <br/>
player (3 hours max) found getting in groups to be too hard for me. Add in <br/>
a corpse recovery and you get very little fighting time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Also, I just wanted to offer my sincere thanks to Rokenn and his wonderful <br/>
web page. I refer to Caster&#39;s Realm for all my other classes spell info, <br/>
but nothing comes close to the in-depth analysis for bard info than his web <br/>
page. I have his song analysis downloaded into my palm pilot and every now <br/>
and then pour through it when I&#39;m burned out on solitaire while waiting <br/>
somewhere. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If any new bards have joined this list recently, I highly recommend you <br/>
