<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843466942">So what was the theory behind the idea to shorten casting/recast times on so<br/>
many spells?  What was the problem, caster&#39;s not still totally dominant in<br/>
the game?  Someone realize that while shamans could keep three buffs up on<br/>
an entire party like bards without losing fighting mana, they couldn&#39;t cast<br/>
them all on the whole party in the space of 18 seconds like bards can?<br/>
<br/>
As you can tell I&#39;m a bit on the grouchy side today.  Had to spend too much<br/>
time this morning deleting guild messages of casters crowing over having<br/>
their power increased.<br/>
