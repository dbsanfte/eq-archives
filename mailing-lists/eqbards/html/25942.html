&gt; Katta is a cool place.  undead spawn as you walk thru the graveyards<br/>
tho -- they were green to me at 56 but they are not decaying skeletons<br/>
either.  Some might have a tough time with them.<br/>

&gt;<br/>

<br/>
If i remember correctly, they were dark blue to me at level 44, i have also<br/>
seen level 40 guys soloing there, so i&#39;d say they are hill giant level<br/>
