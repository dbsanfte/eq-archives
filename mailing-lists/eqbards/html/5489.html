<div id="ygrps-yiv-185171196">I love meeting players from other countries! I can sometimes spot them per <br/>
english skills but most times not, ingame. Then its the &#39;where are you, <br/>
anway?&#39; routine. We have several Eurpoeans in our guild but only 1 is <br/>
usually on at anything remotely like our American play hours. I have run <br/>
into the odd Japanese ocassionally on Xegony during our play hours but their <br/>
main continent is logging about the time we are getting started. We also <br/>
have a few French Canadians in our guild. You would think Canadians would be <br/>
very close to Americans but not always. The thing that will trip you up <br/>
fastest with folks of different countries is culture references. Sometimes <br/>
its harmless:<br/>
<br/>
Guild wizard (american) meets guild barbarian warrior (canadian) for the <br/>
first time:<br/>
Wiz: You look like Peter Rabbit in that horned helm!<br/>
Barb: Umm, who is Peter Rabbit?<br/>
<br/>
I always take it as a new opportunity to learn things. We are going to try <br/>
out the BattleField Communicator this week and the Canadian is already <br/>
worried about his speaking English and accent. And then there&#39;s me with my <br/>
Southern Drawl. I can&#39;t wait, LOL.<br/>
