<b>Subject:</b> Returning Lvl 35 Bard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644578959">Hey Guys-<br/>
<br/>
I left EQ about a year ago for AC (lvled an xbow mage to 47 there and a<br/>
unarmed fighter to 44 till I got bored), but never cancelled my account, and<br/>
lurked on this list that entire time.  Anyhow, all my friends are still<br/>
playing or returning like I am, and I have to re-learn how to fight my bard<br/>
with all the nerfs&#92;changes of the last year.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I was always a battle-bard with both weaps swinging and<br/>
twisting 2 to 3 songs at once.  During the timed I was away many of you guys<br/>
have perfected the &quot;instrument&quot; battle bard and I am considering giving that<br/>
a try.  I was one of those that relied heavily on Lullaby, Chains and Pixie<br/>
Strike...but it sounds like those have been nerfed to oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
The only &quot;special&quot; instrument i have at this time is the mistmoore<br/>
battledrums. I was outfitted in a complete set of steel plate (yes, back in<br/>
the days when that was considered amazing for anyone at my level), although<br/>
I have a brigandine tunic now, and some kind of special sleeves one of my<br/>
buds handed me.  My current weapons are a yak and a silvery war axe<br/>
(offhand).  I have both piercing and slashing maxxed, and I could max blunt<br/>
pretty easily.<br/>
<br/>
What I am looking for is this -- what would you consider a &quot;prime&quot; setup for<br/>
someone of my level.  Also, what were your preferred song mixes when you<br/>
were in your mid-thirties?<br/>
<br/>
It looks like I will be doing alot of grouping in Kunark during the next few<br/>
weeks, and I am currently in Overthere.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to your input!<br/>
