<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485876585">Yeah, I had this happen ALOT over this past weekend, and not once did the<br/>
command work :o/  I just went back to the old standby of rapidly hitting<br/>
another song&#39;s hotkey about 10 or 12 times.  It usually does the trick, but<br/>
until Verant tosses out some new servers to lower the post-Christmas<br/>
population (lotsa folks must have gotten EQ for Christmas.  Sorry Verant,<br/>
but when I log on at a peak time and notice 75% of the servers well over the<br/>
goal population, then yes, there IS an overcrowding problem.) there&#39;ll be a<br/>
LOT of stuck songs.<br/>

&gt;Has anyone had any luck at all getting the /stopsong command to work?<br/>
&gt;I was fighting in Unrest last night (note to self, never ever go there<br/>
&gt;again!) and managed to get my song stuck a number of different times<br/>
&gt;(sigh).  And of course my party is asking for the healing song in down<br/>
&gt;time, and I would have loved to.  Except I&#39;m stuck playing binding and<br/>
&gt;daren&#39;t move in case I bring the whole house down on us!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, nothing I could think of doing would stop the silly song from<br/>
&gt;playing.  Tried /stopsong, no luck.  I hope I just had the syntax<br/>
&gt;wrong please!  But I even tried .... sitting, ducking, reading my<br/>
&gt;songbook, even went so far as unmemming a song and re-memming it, but<br/>
&gt;no luck.  Didn&#39;t want to zone for fear of having a train behind me all<br/>
&gt;nodding!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please tell me I&#39;m not alone in this!  And is there any way of<br/>
&gt;actually correcting it apart from getting stunned, or how about what<br/>
&gt;causes the song to get stuck and I&#39;ll try to avoid it again!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;grumble, mumble, grumble&gt;<br/>
