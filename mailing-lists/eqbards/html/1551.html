<b>Subject:</b> Why is everyone so worried about the mana thing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-20317540">So far there is absolutely no indication that this affects, or will affect<br/>
the vast majority of songs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s for a DD/AOE song with 400+ damage.  While, at that level, a bard<br/>
can deliver far more than that over time without mana loss, sometimes<br/>
you need that damage in one blast.  For that reason alone, it sounds like<br/>
a good addition to the bard abilities.<br/>
<br/>
To suddenly require mana for all, or even a large number number of songs<br/>
means a completely different class.  On the character creation screen, int<br/>
would have to show green, as it would effect mana (hehe, or maybe that&#39;s<br/>
why charisma is important for bards........)  With a limit on the length of<br/>
time<br/>
a song could be sung, the effects would have to be increased (like the new<br/>
song).  All in all, it would amount to scrapping the class and starting<br/>
over, not<br/>
something I can see verant doing at this juncture.<br/>
<br/>
Brad has already expressed reluctance to make big changes now that release<br/>
has come, as too many people are affected (witness the final anti-camping<br/>
decision).<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, this affects very few bards.  If events should prove that<br/>
Verant<br/>
is moving to more large scale changes of the bard, rather than putting in<br/>
features<br/>
that were probably intended from the outset, there will be plenty of time to<br/>
organize a large scale /feedback campaign about the changes.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I&#39;d love to see a lower level version of this replace 14<br/>
:).<br/>
Sometimes a fight stays even down to the end, or worse, a run of hits by<br/>
the mob makes it dicey.  One light nuke would be nice at that point to<br/>
regain the upper hand, and win.<br/>
