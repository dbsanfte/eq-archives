paying for other people&#39;s mistakes.  Sometimes I wish we had<br/>
check-boxes next to each party member&#39;s names, and I could<br/>
just exclude one person (or two or more) from my song effects.<br/>

When you group with casters, mention every now and then that<br/>
you get a mana regeneration song at level 32.  They tend to<br/>
take much more interest in keeping you happy and listening to<br/>
your requests once they know that.  :-)<br/>

Tanks tend to be more stubborn, especially rangers and<br/>
paladins (the ones who are least dependent on others).  One of<br/>
the pallies I constantly group with still has this annoying<br/>
habit of jumping into fights when I&#39;ve invised everyone from a<br/>
train.<br/>
