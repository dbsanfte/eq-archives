<b>Subject:</b> Re: How Lullaby used to be. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572096697">First of all - I agree that Lullaby works much differently and much less<br/>
effectively than it used to.  I remember using it last summer to the<br/>
amazement of group members.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve had mixed results with it in general as far how &quot;helpful&quot; the<br/>
song is.  I was in a group with two other Bards in the King Room of Sol A -<br/>
and it seemed pretty good.  Not sure the reasons (a good nuker and Druid<br/>
laying DOT&#39;s down - or perhaps two other bards singing away).  While there<br/>
were a lot of resists - it definitely kept the damage down.<br/>
<br/>
However,  last night in Mistmore Cave all it seemed to do was get the mobs<br/>
to aggro on me.  They probably have higher MR than the gobbies - but<br/>
regardless.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I have to take issue with calling Verant &quot;liars&quot;.  I don&#39;t<br/>
recall the exact words they used - but it is possible that they whether we<br/>
agree with them or not - they may have &quot;fixed&quot; the song to work the way they<br/>
intended to.  Again - not sure of the wording - so perhaps they have been<br/>
less than forward if this is the case.  You could still call them liars in<br/>
this case - and it&#39;s a matter of semantics.<br/>
<br/>
But more than likely - was Verant lying when they said Alchemy was working?<br/>
No, they were just sadly mistaken.  I&#39;ve worked as a programmer for some<br/>
time - and been in situations where I refused to believe a bug existed for<br/>
quite some time until it stared me right in the face.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that we need to keep pressing Verant to address these issues.  But<br/>
calling them Liars and telling them they have the wrong &quot;vision&quot; for bards<br/>
isn&#39;t going to get us anywhere.  They have a vision for bards they believe<br/>
in.  It&#39;s their bat and ball - so it&#39;s their ballgame and they call the<br/>
shots.  I think you&#39;re crazy to believe that we can dictate what are<br/>
essentially personnel decisions for them (i.e. have GZ replaced as<br/>
determining the design of the Bard character)<br/>
<br/>
Our best bet is to press them to explain that vision - and do our best to<br/>
prove to them when they are mistaken that the code doesn&#39;t work the way they<br/>
think it does.  They won&#39;t give exact statistics  - but we can at least<br/>
press the issue by showing actual results.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Lullaby - we need to show them when the Resist Rate is 40 or<br/>
50 or 80 or 90 - when they (perhaps secretly) believe it should 25 or 30...<br/>

&gt; Harmonic I agree with you 100% I used to use Lullaby MUCH more often, and<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; at times do in Caziac entry to slow the action.. hardly works now but is<br/>
better then nothing.  However it is possible that they did not change the<br/>
song.  The problem is they probably DID alter the resist code which the song<br/>
rolls against. Remember we don&#39;t count in the grand Verant plan.<br/>
&gt; What they DO lie about and I really think we need to do something about<br/>
this, is that they have anyone actually play testing bards.  One of the most<br/>
important things I think we need to do is demand a bard advocate to replace<br/>
GZ. </span></blockquote></div>
