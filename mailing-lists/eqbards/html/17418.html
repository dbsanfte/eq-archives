<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144150898">The whole point was that this wasn&#39;t a pick up group, but instead it was my<br/>
regular group.<br/>
<br/>
For pick up groups, I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with someone rolling on an<br/>
item (even if they can&#39;t use it) although I do not do it myself, and I make<br/>
sure to state that in no uncertain terms in the hopes that the strength of<br/>
my convictions will encourage others to follow my lead. The only time I&#39;ll<br/>
roll on item I don&#39;t need is if a) a close friend of mine needs one, or b)<br/>
no one else in the group needs it. Furthermore, in case a above, I&#39;ll<br/>
usually give priority to someone in the group that needs the item.<br/>

Without resending this thread, the discussion was about whether specific<br/>
character types should be allowed to lotto for specific items.<br/>
<br/>
My own stance on this is:  if it isn&#39;t no-drop/not bard, or lore/I<br/>
already own it, I have a right to lotto for it.  This isn&#39;t Baldur&#39;s<br/>
Gate, where I&#39;m controlling a party of six, and I maximize my personal<br/>
effectiveness by putting the best equipment with the most appropriate<br/>
character.  I&#39;ve got one character in this game.  Me.  There isn&#39;t a<br/>
prayer that I would buy the &quot;he can use it better&quot; argument in a pickup<br/>
group, and seeing just how often players pick up and move between guilds,<br/>
I don&#39;t even buy it at the guild level. Among very close, trusted<br/>
friends, I&#39;ll do it, but even then only if it doesn&#39;t happen repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Even if I can&#39;t use the item effectively, it&#39;s still a tradeable item<br/>
that I can use to get something I CAN use.  And if I start to buy in to<br/>
the &quot;he can use it better&quot; argument, I&#39;ll never get anything but<br/>
instruments, and I&#39;ll certainly never have anything lying around my bank<br/>
to allow me to trade up.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m good enough to be in the group, I&#39;m good enough to lotto for any<br/>
item the group gets.  If they can use it better than I can, they can<br/>
trade me something for it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a complete hard-ass about this, btw.  My first FG run, when the<br/>
leader asked all melee types to lotto for mith arms, I rolled (to the<br/>
annoyance of many) and won (to the even greater annoyance of many).  I<br/>
gave them to my level 50 warrior friend.  But he&#39;s given ME stuff, and I<br/>
know he&#39;s not going to take them and sell them on EBay or anything.<br/>
