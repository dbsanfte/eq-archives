<br/>
In case some of you don&#39;t know, the entire player-base on the Test server<br/>
was wiped yesterday.  Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>
conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>
from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for those<br/>
that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>
<br/>
I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character over<br/>
the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what I&#39;ve<br/>
heard.<br/>
<br/>
Lyrnia, you had a high level Bard on test, didn&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
I read on the Gameplay board this morning that Brad is taking suggestions<br/>
on:<br/>
<br/>
1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>
<br/>
2) Offering players to move their characters onto the live servers without<br/>
their items.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>
stinks nonetheless.</div>
