<div id="ygrps-yiv-476364450">Actually, my friend I think you are mistaken.  I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure I have read even Brad say that selo&#39;s<br/>
originally was supposed to break root.  Now, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t probably because the sow folks complained that<br/>
bards were too powerful which is BS.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I got rooted last night by something and I<br/>
couldn&#39;t break it by starting up selo&#39;s.  It did,<br/>
however, work against my wizard friend&#39;s root.  Or at<br/>
least it appeared to.  And this was by starting up<br/>
selo&#39;s AFTER the root was in place.  Since he is 4<br/>
levels higher than me I&#39;d be surprised if I was<br/>
breaking it on my own with some strange magic<br/>
resistance that I don&#39;t know of.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This IS a bug. Its so obvious accelerando wasnt mean<br/>
&gt; to break root and ghoul root. Moving around while<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s still the root icon on your screen? Being<br/>
&gt; rooted after you zone? This is a bug and always has<br/>
&gt; been, and using it to break root is exploiting (not<br/>
&gt; that it really matters to Verant). But I wish bards<br/>
&gt; would quit treating this as a nifty feature and<br/>
&gt; acknowledge it as a bug. So technically the song is<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &quot;un-broken&quot; as you say.<br/>
