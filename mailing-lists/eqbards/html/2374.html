The command is simply too ugly to be part of game play.  If there weren&#39;t a<br/>
strong debugging reason for it&#39;s existence I&#39;d prefer to see it removed.  I<br/>
find it&#39;s use intensely jarring.  When someone tells me or asks me for<br/>
coordinates I roleplay nothing but confusion about their gibberish.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, don&#39;t be silly.  It&#39;s called Common because it is an innate ability of<br/>
all sentient species, with little learning involved.  Not to mention that<br/>
fact that its use by Ogres and Trolls is rarely flawless.  I&#39;d venture to<br/>
guess that other races, tortured by this knowledge they cannot escape,<br/>
insist on preserving a language of their own, while for some reasons Humans<br/>
have no such difficulty, considering themselves the standard by which all<br/>
others are measured.<br/>
<br/>
Rogues go one better, with an additional class language of their own.<br/>
