<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270816151">Well, I am going to have to say something in defense of the<br/>
Shaman here ...<br/>
<br/>
		I agree that how a person chooses to play their character<br/>
can be up for debate, and often it&#39;s easy to tell another class how to play.<br/>
Aside from some obvious mistakes though, sometimes you just can&#39;t know until<br/>
you play that class yourself.<br/>
<br/>
		For instance, I have had parties YELL at me for not using<br/>
Greater Heal right away.  What they don&#39;t understand is that to do so is<br/>
almost always a death sentence for ME.  And frankly, I&#39;m tired of being the<br/>
sacrificial lamb.   If you&#39;re not a healer, you can&#39;t understand the power<br/>
of a heal taunt  - Bards can, cuz practically every song is as big of a<br/>
taunt as heal.<br/>
<br/>
		Often, I join a group as the healer, and because I&#39;m a<br/>
shaman, my group wants:<br/>
1.	Heals<br/>
2.	Chloroplast/Regen<br/>
3.	Buffs (Str/dex/agi/hp/sta/ac)<br/>
4.	Slowdown/Quicken<br/>
<br/>
		Now, I am not a wisdom freak - 150ish, so Togors (slowdown)<br/>
and Quicken 2-3 party members takes 2 bubs of mana.  Buffing same three with<br/>
two buffs takes me down to 1.5 bubs.  Chloroplast takes almost a full bub<br/>
alone - per person!  Now where is the mana for heals? So sometimes, you have<br/>
to choose, can&#39;t give everyone what they want or cast things in the order<br/>
others think you should.<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway, my point, I guess is that while I AGREE personally<br/>
that a shaman should Togors before DOTing, DOTing takes less mana and is<br/>
much faster casting...and sometimes the malise is worth it on high resistant<br/>
mobs if it helps the casters do full damage instead of 12.  <br/>
<br/>
		Stressed at work (and guessing you can tell that by how<br/>
cranky this email sounds :-))<br/>

				While I agree perfectly with this post, you<br/>
are contradicting yourself<br/>
				quite well.<br/>
<br/>
				1.  No one tell me what songs to sing.<br/>
<br/>
				2.  Shamans should cast these spells in this<br/>
order, and <br/>
				    Clerics should never nuke or melee.<br/>
<br/>
				Even if you are correct in what is optimal<br/>
for the group, it sounds<br/>
				bad when you say both these things in the<br/>
same breath.<br/>
