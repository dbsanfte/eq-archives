<div id="ygrps-yiv-275319108">Thanks for the info.  I&#39;m going to try to explore a<br/>
little tonight.  I&#39;ve read somewere that there are a<br/>
couple of skels that are necro pets and to touch them<br/>
is to die. Is this area in the southeast corner where<br/>
they are located?<br/>
<br/>
On another note...<br/>
<br/>
Is the Login Server down?  My son is home sick and<br/>
can&#39;t seem to log in.  I&#39;m at work so I don&#39;t know if<br/>
he&#39;s doing anything wrong.  I installed Evermon here<br/>
and tried to check, but can&#39;t connect.  However, I<br/>
don&#39;t know whether this is because the server is down<br/>
or Evermon won&#39;t work thru the Company&#39;s firewall.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the good info on the Rathe Mtns,<br/>

PS.  This is a duplicate.  Sorry, my work email seems<br/>
sick today.<br/>
