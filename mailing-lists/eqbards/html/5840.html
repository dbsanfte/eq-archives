&gt; No I spend a huge ammount of time invisible and I have noticed the opposite.<br/>
&gt; I have been seen on numerous occasions where I blink into view. Its scarin<br/>
&gt; the crap out of me. I was seen 3 times in less than an hour this morning in<br/>
&gt; Permafrost, fortunately I had my Jboots activated and had the speed to get<br/>
&gt; to the zone. My skill in Wind is 200, I maxed it a few days ago. I use invis<br/>
&gt; to navigate all sorts of places in upper and lower Guk, and Permafrost. I<br/>
&gt; always used to disband from my party just so I wouldnt have to worry about<br/>
&gt; my Invis fading on me because it was always 100% reliable before this last<br/>
&gt; patch. Now I dont know anymore, at least I know the caster Invis is going to<br/>
&gt; work a little while.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pretty odd because I have _never_ found Clouding to be 100%<br/>
reliable from the time I got it all the way to L49 (just can&#39;t be<br/>
bothered getting 50 now.) My skill has always been maxed for my level<br/>
but I still got those blink into view messages.<br/>
