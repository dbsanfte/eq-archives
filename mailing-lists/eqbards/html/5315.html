<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066495732">I&#39;m a lvl 30 Bard on Fennin Ro with the following stats. Str 115, Sta 86, Agi 132, Dex 151, Wis 60, Int 79, Cha 90, HP 699, AC 559. Yes I&#39;m a bit twinked.. anyhow.  My one hand blunt is maxed, as is my one hand slash, and dual weild.  My piercing is only at 60 or so (need to work on that one).  The following info is when fighting aviak&#39;s and Centaur&#39;s in South Karana. I also always have my PGT in my left hand (good for constency for this test).  I am solo&#39;ng in these tests, with melee and bellow being my primary mode, occasionally with the claw I&#39;ll throw in JWW, but not constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Staff of Writhing:<br/>
Heavy weapon, large stamina drain, yes it proc&#39;s, but only 2-3 times a battle. I do not notice any higher resist with the -9 cha loss.  Overall, a neat looking weapon, but not especially effective.<br/>
<br/>
Bladed Thulian Claw:<br/>
Light, fast, low damage.  The speed is awesome, and it seems to me that my dual weild goes off more often with this weapon, which may explain why I do better with this than my Staff of Writhing.  Low stamina loss, which is important if all of a sudden you have another spawn in front of you before you get a chance to rest. Maybe its because the dual weild goes off more often, but it also seems that my pgt procs more often when using this weapon.  I notice that the battles seem longer, but I usually end up with more health, and more stamina at the end.<br/>
<br/>
Runed Falcion:<br/>
Nice weapon, imho better than the claw.  Slower than the claw but more than twice the damage (11 vs. 5) same weight as the claw, but the battles seem to be over faster.  Dual weild doesn&#39;t go off as much, my pgt still proc&#39;s though (less maybe because its a shorter battle).  Overall a better weapon than either the staff, or the claw.  (Note: I am fighting non-casters, the claw may be better on casters in order to interupt them)<br/>
<br/>
I had focused on boosting my dex, in order to make the staff proc more often, but with 151 dex (with no song, or cast buff&#39;s) it really didn&#39;t seem to help all that much, a little, but its not like the staff casts its 48p DD every other blow or anything.<br/>
<br/>
This is a real world test, I used no calculator to figure stats, or determine ratio&#39;s etc.. results may vary<br/>
