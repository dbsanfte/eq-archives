&gt; On a side note, camping ogre bouncers and other guards is not as financially<br/>

do comfortably solo).  I made 800pp there one day last week<br/>
(total was about 1700pp but the rest went to group members).  <br/>
The biggest problem I had was with a couple people in another<br/>
group didn&#39;t like that I was killing &quot;all&quot; the giants in the<br/>
area, and were deliberately dropping by where I was charming<br/>
giants and taking one of my giants back to their group.  I<br/>
went and had a talk with them.  Apparently, even though I<br/>
maxed out my charisma when I created my character, I&#39;m<br/>
supposed to fight these giants in straight melee.  *sigh* They<br/>
said more giants spawned in the area I was at.  I told them I<br/>
was keeping the area near me clear of trash mobs (with the<br/>
implication they weren&#39;t, which was causing more giants to<br/>
spawn in my area).  They accused me of being greedy taking two<br/>
giants to their one.  I said that didn&#39;t make sense since they<br/>
took time to find one giant, and I took twice as much time to<br/>
find two giants.  Maybe these arguments will come in handy to<br/>
you folks if someone accuses you of the same.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, yesterday I was doing great - made about 400pp in 3<br/>
hours.  Then while running, turning to avoid some other giant<br/>
fighters, and switching to my weapons to finish off a giant<br/>
with melee, I DROPPED MY MISTMOORE DRUM!!!  :(<br/>
<br/>
I spent 15 minutes looking for it afterwards (I killed the<br/>
giant with one hit, so it turns out there wasn&#39;t even any need<br/>
for me to have been running from it while switching to<br/>
weapons).  Never found it, and I figured it had decayed by<br/>
then.  :(  I realize now that I was looking for a bag on the<br/>
ground when I should&#39;ve been looking for a small flute.  <br/>
Didn&#39;t help that it was nighttime either.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so slow...  :(<br/>
