<br/>
If you twink via equipment that other characters have<br/>
outgrown, or happened to pick up during general play, then<br/>
it&#39;s not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
If you twink via equipment that was obtained specifically to<br/>
twink/trade while other people were also trying to obtain that<br/>
same equipment at the same time, then your equipment came at<br/>
the cost of depriving those people of the opportunity to get<br/>
that equipment.  This may mean nothing to you now, but when<br/>
you&#39;re level 25 and get to a nice item drop site and find a<br/>
level 50 who can&#39;t even use the item camping it, and who<br/>
refuses to share or yield, then you will understand.<br/>
