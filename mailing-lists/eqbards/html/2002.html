the high teens - lower twenties range, maybe even up into the<br/>
thirties.  There are slower piercing weapons with better<br/>
damage for rogues, spellcasters don&#39;t really need melee<br/>
damage, and bards often don&#39;t have the strength and stamina to<br/>
dual wield the heavier weapons favored by warriors and<br/>
rangers.  If there&#39;s any weapon that has BARD written all over<br/>
it, the dirk is it.<br/>

I would hate to see a bard pay a week&#39;s worth of platinum for<br/>
it when he could easily get one for himself in about an hour.  <br/>
(I would prefer even more to see its availability tweaked so<br/>
that it *is* worth a week&#39;s worth of platinum, and was<br/>
possibly abusing the presence of a Verant insider on this list<br/>
to state that opinion.  If you feel I got carried away, then I<br/>
apologize.)<br/>
