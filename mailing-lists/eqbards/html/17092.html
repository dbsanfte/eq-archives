<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603501804">Overall I&#39;d say that you&#39;re not operating in groups that are pushing their<br/>
limits enough.  A bard is a HUGE downtime reducer, at all levels.  I&#39;ll<br/>
explain inside the post.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We do not do much for downtime between 12th and 31st.  Before 12th I was<br/>
&gt; greatly appreciated for my downtime redux, since then no one mentions it.<br/>
&gt; Mana is the sole cause of our downtime at this point and I can do nothing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; alleviate that for another 9 levels.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not true at all.  If you are pulling enough to fight constantly mana<br/>
is a problem only if your casters are having to cast too much.  At around<br/>
12th a bard should consider going all-instrument.  I did and my group<br/>
immediately noticed a huge difference in the number of mobs we could hand at<br/>
a time, the shortened downtime we experienced and the greater efficiency we<br/>
had in dealing with creatures.<br/>
<br/>
My combo from 12th to 18th was basically:  HoR, CoD, Anthem with a lute<br/>
equipped the whole time.  I also spun in Bellow now and then.  At 18th I<br/>
twisted in DDD instead of Bellow.  This accomplished several things:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Gave the healer 1 target to heal:  Me.<br/>
2)  Cut down the number of nukes the wiz/druid/whoever had to cast (Dot&#39;s<br/>
did the rest)<br/>
3)  Kept the primary tank totally healed almost every fight<br/>
4)  NPC&#39;s were mostly dead by the time we got to them, thus shorter fights<br/>
on big pulls, thus less mana used<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I left a group I was begged to stay because the group immediately<br/>
had to back off on the number of mobs they pulled or the power of mobs they<br/>
pulled.  Our estimate was that I doubled (or nearly doubled) the<br/>
effectiveness of the group.  We tested this mostly in East Karana (pretty<br/>
much my home from 12th to 20th) but it works out the same in any zone where<br/>
you can pull a steady supply of nasties.<br/>
<br/>
Bard in Group:  Pulls of 4-5 creatures all blue to white, constant pulls,<br/>
almost no pauses<br/>
Bard out of Group:  Pulls of 2-3 creatures all blue some whites<br/>
occasionally, resting regularly between pulls to get mana/hp back.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; clarity.  Maybe after 32nd I would be able to reduce downtime again, but<br/>

 </span></blockquote>groups<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; haven&#39;t had a hp downtime for at least 2 months.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reducing downtime isn&#39;t just speeding up the regen of mana/hp it&#39;s also the<br/>
slowing down of the USE of mana and HP.  And nobody does that better than a<br/>
bard using instruments.  We do the following when singing<br/>
DOT/Healing/Speedup combos:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Decrease the number of blast spells needed due to DOT being up<br/>
(decreases mana useage)<br/>
2)  Decrease the number of blast spells needed due to Melee being faster<br/>
(Decreases mana useage)<br/>
3)  Decrease the number of blast spells needed due to shorter fights<br/>
(Decreases mana useage)<br/>
4)  Decrease the number of healing spells needed due to our regen song<br/>
(Decreases mana useage)<br/>
5)  Decrease the number of healing spells needed due to shorter fights<br/>
(Decreases mana useage)<br/>
6)  Decrease, dramatically, the odds of a healer getting mobbed due to our<br/>
DOTs keeping the unengaged npc&#39;s attention.<br/>
<br/>
So, as you see, we DRASTICALLY reduce the _expenditure_ of mana.  Thus<br/>
decreasing downtime.  Many groups don&#39;t realize this because they don&#39;t<br/>
think about how much less mana they&#39;re USING durning fights.  It could also,<br/>
as I mentioned above, be due to the fact that the group isn&#39;t performing at<br/>
peak efficiency when you&#39;re in the group.  You&#39;d be AMAZED at how much more<br/>
a group with one of us bards in it can handle than a group that doesn&#39;t have<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Likewise bards are not the group powerup many think they are.  If I take<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; present group which has become very regular and I bow out, they see very<br/>
&gt; little change in the mobs they can handle.  If the cleric, the druid, the<br/>
&gt; ranger, the necro, or the enchanter leave, we see a huge reduction in what<br/>
&gt; we can take.  take out any of those 5 and we lose 50% or near to it.  take<br/>
&gt; me out and we lose maybe 10%.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, see above, you are not operating at peak efficiency if this is the<br/>
case.  In every zone I played in from around level 10 to level 50 every<br/>
single group I&#39;ve been in has noticed a dramatic difference if I leave<br/>
verses...say... the wizard, necro or ranger.  Losing a druid or cleric will<br/>
ALWAYS hurt more because they are your true emergency healers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I could be off-base, not everyone plays the same, nor does everyone<br/>
know SolA like the back of their hands.  But after having run around as a<br/>
bard since sometime in summer of 1998 and having evolved my tactics with<br/>
advice from other bards, some here, some on older message boards, some met<br/>
in game, I can pretty much state that everything I stated here is factual.<br/>
You may play differently than I do.  I almost always use DDD/COD/HOR/Binding<br/>
even at level 34 in combat.  Once you get it throw in CoC instead of Binding<br/>
for even MORE power ;)  It doesn&#39;t matter where I am, (non planar) this<br/>
combo works extremely well.  The only place it ever got me in big trouble<br/>
was runny.  And that was back when our songs got all goofed up by a nasty<br/>
bug during beta. Oh... it&#39;s a bad idea in Mistmoore as well.  That zone is<br/>
so wacked it&#39;s painful.  Though you can do the combo in a LOT of places<br/>
there.  Learning where NOT to do it was kind of painful though ;)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate.  I&#39;ve never had a problem proving my value to a group.  I<br/>
simply would go solo for a bit.  Generally after 2 or three attempts at<br/>
pulling the same number/kind of mobs we&#39;d been pulling while I was there and<br/>
having several deaths or near-deaths I&#39;d get a tell saying &quot;Please come<br/>
back, we need you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
To steal someone&#39;s phrase:  Your mileage may vary ;)<br/>
