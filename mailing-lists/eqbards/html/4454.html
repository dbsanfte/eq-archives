This is one of the reasons I play a bard: I can go places others wouldn&#39;t<br/>
even attempt travelling to at my level.  I had criscrossed most of Norrath<br/>
by level 7.  Explored the Aviak Village with no one else in the zone, crept<br/>
through highhold when it was strewn with countless corpses, and was bereft<br/>
of anyone to save me if things went wrong.  I learned then how the Orcs<br/>
behave when no one else is there to kill them, and then knew how safe the<br/>
place can be if one is careful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really missed the thrill of exploring, and so I&#39;ll be going to Fear.<br/>
Somehow I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever reach level 45 before I finally leave EQ.  I<br/>
level so slowly.<br/>
