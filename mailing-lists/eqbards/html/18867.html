<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014767349">please did i even say that?  i just said i did not think getting 900AC as a<br/>
bard was as easy as you claimed it to be.  and i have sacrificed stats quite<br/>
a bit for AC.  i assume you were responding to me, my message is not part of<br/>
this reply and i think egroups was a little screwy yesterday.<br/>
<br/>

Earring 2: Opalline (AC 2)<br/>
Face: Sarnak Hide Mask (AC 6, or Guise of the Deceiver for CHA gear AC 4)<br/>

wood elf)<br/>

<br/>
ok i may be off, but with practically the best AC item a bard can wear in<br/>
every slot i have 838 AC, yet everyone else gets this AC with ease.  maybe<br/>
my character is bugged.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; So I guess my question is:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it that you are envious of the warrior/paladin/sk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; AC or is it that you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just want it to be easier to get over 900 AC?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want high AC you have to do what warriors do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; give up having high<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stats so that you get AC and strength.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want high stats you&#39;re going to sacrifice AC.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>
