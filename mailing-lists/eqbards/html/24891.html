<div id="ygrps-yiv-301867734">i am level 48 now and until your level i sang mostly berserkers while<br/>
meleeing plus manasong and snare if i needed to. in xp groups i always tried<br/>
to minimize the groups downtime, sometimes i even just stood near the<br/>
clerics/shammies and played mana, hymn with lute and berserkers.<br/>
<br/>
all depends on the situation of course. on casting mobs a pulse of psalm<br/>
cant hurt. i wouldnt use the psalms of cooling/warmth for the damage-shield<br/>
though, its not really woth it imo.<br/>
<br/>
when grouped with shammies or chanters, berserkers and verses are pointless.<br/>
in fact i had many groups in which i found nothing much better to sing than<br/>
just plain manasong =) and waiting for multiple mob pulls to charm or mezz<br/>
the adds (this was in xp groups in DL)<br/>
<br/>
the chants are much more than just the weird message. with a good instrument<br/>
you can inflict significant damage and a very nice MR/FR/CR debuff. just be<br/>
careful not to aggro too much ;)<br/>

Hey everyone...<br/>
Just curious how many of us would choose to sing Berserker Cressendo over<br/>
Verses of Celerity while wielding weapons...and if you are using a brass<br/>
horn for this, what other songs best compliment it?<br/>
My normal melee  compliment is weapons and twisting Verses of Celerity/psalm<br/>
of cooling and chains (sometimes chant of flame because I like people&#39;s<br/>
reactions to the %T begins to chant message).  Very curious about what<br/>
other, mid 40s bards sing before getting Nivs/chords of cessation and shield<br/>
of song...<br/>
Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>
Finally singing the Dirge</div>
