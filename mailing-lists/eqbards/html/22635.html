<div id="ygrps-yiv-47052779">no lute has dropped the last 2 clearings.  is it only a SW drop?  but like<br/>
you said, no real need with SSS though it&#39;s nice all the same.  we did get a<br/>
grey suede shoes and that 40/35 monk staff.  we got a crown and 2 shrouds<br/>
off PD, no robe yet though.<br/>

&gt; gotten one of those nifty Lyran&#39;s Lutes yet? I love that <br/>
&gt; thing, not sure how <br/>
&gt; often I&#39;ll use it though once I get my SSS. Also RE: Phara <br/>
&gt; Dar - Grey Suede <br/>
&gt; Boots and Robe of Azure Sky finally dropped (last week), I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; sure you&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; either seen them drop or saw the pics on FoH&#39;s website. The <br/>
&gt; robe itself <br/>
&gt; makes me drool and I HATE playing caster classes.<br/>
