Not by much, but it was cute to see.  :)<br/>

Nuking mobs are fun to charm.  Too bad they seem to insist on<br/>
meleeing once the target gets low on hp.<br/>

Healing mobs I generally do not charm.  Like you said, if they<br/>
start a heal before you charm, it still goes through.  Since<br/>
they&#39;re going to become uncharmed roughly every 10 seconds,<br/>
they&#39;re going to have a chance to heal roughly every 10<br/>
seconds.  I put them to sleep with Pixie Strike, or have the<br/>
group kill them first.  Or if the party has a couple nukers,<br/>
they can nuke the main target to death before the healing mob<br/>
has a chance to heal.<br/>
