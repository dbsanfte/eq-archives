&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll start a Troll Shaman or something.  Lotta fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve got an Ogre Shaman - it&#39;s a very close tie as<br/>
&gt;to which is more entertaining between that and my<br/>
&gt;half-elf Bard. My Bard can get into cities though,<br/>
&gt;so that keeps me playing him.. That and at level 14,<br/>
&gt;the mana consumption of a Shaman is very high and<br/>
&gt;results in boring medding times that we don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;to go through with our Bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thulian Claws the other night and they&#39;re LORE.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They were destroyed before they hit the ground<br/>
&gt; &gt; - 700pp flushed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not sure what happened to you here, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;dropped my Dragoon Dirk (LORE) and picked it up<br/>
&gt;again. Being LORE simply means that you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;own two of them. Your claws should have been on<br/>
&gt;the ground where you dropped them. Maybe not very<br/>
&gt;visible - but still there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have dropped my claw a few times and never lost it. It can be hard to spot <br/>
as it is viewed head-on, ie it looks like several metel dots.<br/>
Sorry about your loss<br/>
