Subject: [eqbards] Kunark bards stuff<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We went to City of Mist the first few nights of Kunark and it was great<br/>
fun.  We eventually got 4 groups in the city and were using AE to pull stuff<br/>
from the first level Lord&#39;s temple.  Sometimes too many reavers would smoosh<br/>
us but other times we could deal with them and get the Lord.  We have a pile<br/>
of jade Reavers, the Thornblades, and the other one I mentioned in my<br/>
eariler post.  We did see a single reaver, respawn reaver, respawn reaver,<br/>
then spawn Lord.  There are 2 Lords that I have heard casting and we<br/>
eventually them both (iirc).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I looted an Ancient Coin off the Captain of the Guards.  Later talked to<br/>
the male banker and heard about his coin collection.  I guess if you give<br/>
him a Star of Odus (buy in Erud for 120pp about) he gives you a 4 slot box<br/>
and asks you to fill it with 6 coins (is it just me or are these quests<br/>
getting harder?) Anyhow he says he will give you something a &quot;composer&quot; left<br/>
with him - sounds like he is hinting at a bard item.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Later on I got another Ancient Coin off bloodfrienzed goblin in Lake of<br/>
Ill Omen (they would not pull to shore but they did pull nicely to the<br/>
partially submerged platform between the columns.  And there seems to be a<br/>
not yet open zone portal at the bottom of the lake.  Kedge II, Phinnie&#39;s<br/>
Revenge?  Going to be looking for the other coins.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We had some fun in Burining Wood - full group - all 50-52.  Pulling more<br/>
or less non-stop.  Look a 51 Gullerback (sp?), let&#39;s charm him... So, our<br/>
necro charms him and he makes a good pet: Gullerback_08 says, &quot;You will not<br/>
evade me Wurm_18!&quot;  Heh, pets that summon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ended the weekend in Befallen. Delivered a set of gnome picks to one of<br/>
our rogues. She was picking madly to get 200 and at 1.30am when I woke up<br/>
from a short nap while singing elergy for her, she was still at 197 - ugh.<br/>
Those last few points are extremely hard I guess.  Anyone know if there are<br/>
any better doors that the Befallen ones?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. got to remember to bring some CPA (Cabby Pale Ale) back to the drunks<br/>
by the bard merch in FV.  Does it bother any one else to see that fem Barb<br/>
do the bard animation? And the oger?  Well, ogers are down right rude.<br/>
