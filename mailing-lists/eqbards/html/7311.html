&gt; I trust this list.  It had never occured to me that the Root-Nerf wasnt<br/>
&gt; true.  But in the last 3(or so) weeks.  I have been rooted over a half a<br/>
&gt; dozen times and have never been UNable to Selo my way out.  Or so it seems.<br/>

so it&#39;s possible they also slipped up and nerfed it on npc&#39;s as well as<br/>
pc&#39;s and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing it drop so quickly.<br/>
