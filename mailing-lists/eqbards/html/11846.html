<div id="ygrps-yiv-60509362">How here&#39;s a little tale - I&#39;ve got to tell<br/>
About three bad bards - you know so well<br/>
It started way back in Norrath history<br/>
With Sylly, Operaman, and me - Harmy.<br/>
Been had a little druid was the teleporteer <br/>
Just me and my treehugger and a cold short beer<br/>
Warping across the land - kicking up sand<br/>
Mayong&#39;s posse on my tail cause I&#39;m in demand<br/>
One lonely Bardie I be<br/>
All by myself - without nobody<br/>
The sun is beating down on my lambent blue hat<br/>
My blood is gettin&#39; hot - the beer is getting flat<br/>
Lookin&#39; for a woodelf - I ran into a guy<br/>
His name is Operaman, I said, &quot;Howdy&quot; - he said, &quot;Hi&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed<br/>
Four days using Selo&#39;s and that he&#39;s dying of thirst<br/>
The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip<br/>
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip<br/>
He said, &quot;Can I get some?&quot;<br/>
I said, &quot;You can&#39;t get none!&quot;<br/>
Had a chance to flee<br/>
He pulled out his wakashi<br/>
He was quick on the draw - I thought I&#39;d be dead<br/>
He put the sword to my head and this is what he said,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now my name is Operaman - I&#39;ve got a license to kill<br/>
I think you know what time it is - it&#39;s time to get ill<br/>
Now what do we have here - an bardie and his beer<br/>
I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.&quot;<br/>
We stepped into the wind - he had a blade, I had a grin<br/>
You think this story&#39;s over but it&#39;s ready to begin<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now I got the weapon - you got the brew<br/>
You got two choices of what you can do<br/>
It&#39;s not a tough decision as you can see<br/>
I can slice you to shreads or you can group with me&quot; <br/>
I said, I&#39;ll group with you if<br/>
you can get me to the zone<br/>
The vampire&#39;s after me for what I did to his crone.<br/>
I did it like this - I did it like that<br/>
I did it with a charmed sonic bat<br/>
So I click on run - and equip my drum<br/>
And right about now - it&#39;s time to have some fun <br/>
The Queen Sylly - that is my name<br/>
And I know the sweet spot where they got the champagne.&quot;<br/>
We ran for six hours the we hit the spot<br/>
The exp was a pumping and the elfies was hot<br/>
This dude was staring like he knows who we are<br/>
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar<br/>
Operaman said, &quot;Yo, you know this kid?&quot;<br/>
I said, &quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot; - but I know he did<br/>
The kid said, &quot;Get ready cause this ain&#39;t funny<br/>
My name&#39;s Harmonic and I&#39;m about to get money.&quot;<br/>
Pulled out the Ykesha - aimed it at the sky<br/>
He yelled, &quot;Stick &#39;em up!&quot; - and procs did fly<br/>
Hands went up and people hit the floor<br/>
He slayed two kids that ran for the door<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m Harmonic and I get respect<br/>
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect&quot;<br/>
Operaman was with it and he&#39;s my ace<br/>
So I grabbed the guano harvester and I punched him in the face<br/>
The harvester&#39;s out - the cloak wasn&#39;t dropped<br/>
His body had jack - save the bag that plopped<br/>
Harmonic grabbed the bag - Operaman snatched the gold<br/>
I killed two kobolds and a drank my beer that was cold.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Harm.</div>
