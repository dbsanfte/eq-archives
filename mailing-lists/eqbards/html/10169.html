<div id="ygrps-yiv-138573544">Hey Pava :) Good to see your on the list. May I comment ? And spend<br/>
some time on Hot Key management a favorite of mine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1) What is a good strategy to use while dual weilding?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     Keep Jaxon&#39;s Jig of Vigor on your spell list. If you stamina falls<br/>
below a third in a long fight you will need to play it to remain<br/>
effective. The faster you kill the less damage you take.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) I&#39;m currently equipped with a PGT (dmg 6 del 24, berserker str proc wt 6)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  At level 28 I am still using my PGT and love it. It is not unusual for<br/>
me to look up and see most of my team at half health in a heated fight<br/>
and I am still hardly nicked, even sometimes when playing lullaby if the<br/>
PGT is Procing (casting invulnerability ) well. Keeping Dex above 100<br/>
and having good stamina helps. I am experimenting with Thullian Claws I<br/>
just got and my old standby the Dragoon Dirk, switching them out in both<br/>
primary and secondary slots with the PGT.... but that is another<br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ok, Hot Key management. First off we have 6 banks or &quot;pages&quot; of hot<br/>
keys to setup. Each page has 6 &quot;slots&quot; in pairs of 2 you should map to<br/>
your key pad so that reading right to left 1 and 2 are the top, 3 and 4<br/>
are the second pair and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Bank One : This is the primary and I want it to be the one I use to<br/>
quickly switch weapons and instruments.<br/>
          Slot 1: drag your Primary melee slot here, the one with your<br/>
lead weapon.<br/>
          Slot 2: drag an Secondary melee slot here. This is where you<br/>
will be putting your instrument.<br/>
          Slot 3: drag an empty inventory slot here where you will dump<br/>
a weapon (faster than bagging it. I <br/>
                  will explain later). I use the bottom right slot #6 as<br/>
it is the last to fill in looting.<br/>
          Slot 4: drag the inventory slot where you will keep your<br/>
Shralok Pack :) or large bag (back                           packs are<br/>
too heavy to use) with all your instruments and weapons inside.<br/>
          Slot 5: drag your &quot;sit/stand&quot; button here.<br/>
          Slot 6: I drag my &quot;assist&quot; social button here so I can easily<br/>
modify it during down time to add in <br/>
                  the name of the designated Tank ( /assist Killer ) and<br/>
switch targets in combat if I am in                    the middle of<br/>
weapon changes.<br/>
  The beauty of this set up is it&#39;s speed. To go from weapons to<br/>
instruments click on the bag. Notice it opens just above and off to the<br/>
right of the hot key bank. Very convenient. Click on Melee weapon in<br/>
slot 1 picking it up. Move it over the instrument you want and click.<br/>
They switch. With your lute or what ever on your pointer now moving down<br/>
to the left click on Melee slot 2 switching it into that slot. Now STILL<br/>
MOVING IN The same direction you can dump the secondary weapon into the<br/>
empty inventory slot 3. Why not put it back in the bag ? because<br/>
minimize your chance of dropping it by staying over the Hot Key bank,<br/>
the slot is closer than the bag and you don&#39;t have to change directions<br/>
to get there. I can change from weapons to instruments in literally 2<br/>
seconds and the reverse motion to get weapons back is just as fast.<br/>
<br/>
 Bank Two : No question. This is where you will drag the spells you want<br/>
to play in combat.<br/>
            Use slots 1, 2 and 3 for your main songs you are &quot;twisting&quot;,<br/>
Anthem, Largos, Shield.. whatever.<br/>
            Slot 4, corresponding to keypad 4 is the next easiest key to<br/>
get to and that is where I put my<br/>
            Chain song. Brusco&#39;s Bellow and (heaven forbid) Run song are<br/>
other good options here.<br/>
            Slot 5 is where I myself put heal. For me is is easy to go<br/>
from a 1,2,3 pattern to a 1,5,3             pattern.<br/>
            Slot 6- The ever required ASSIST key goes here.<br/>
            Odd stuff like lullaby, that I am going to have to just keep<br/>
punching, I access from the                   regular on screen bank.<br/>
<br/>
Bank Three : Your &quot;Get out of Town&quot; Bank. Could be bank 6 but put it<br/>
where you can get to it fast and                      since I have a<br/>
mouse in one hand its a lot faster to click an arrow than find and punch<br/>
2 keys <br/>
             simultaneously to get to another bank. <br/>
            Slot 1 /corpse ...may you never need it. But having it on<br/>
this key makes it very convenient for                    continual<br/>
punching while running past that Hill Giant with your body bouncing<br/>
along behind :)<br/>
            Slot 2 Run song<br/>
            Slot 3 Heal song<br/>
            Slot 4 Sense heading<br/>
            Slot 5 /Loc<br/>
            Slot 6 Forage<br/>
<br/>
Bank Four : This is my &quot;Fun&quot; bank with animation&#39;s like &quot;Shiver&quot;,<br/>
&quot;laugh&quot;, &quot;dance&quot; and I also have my guild                button here<br/>
that reads &quot;/who all Rising&quot; so I can see who is where for grouping.<br/>
<br/>
Bank Five : Your choice. You might set this up for doing your DD/AEO<br/>
songs and instrument swap out keys as in             bank. I&#39;d put<br/>
Denon&#39;s, Chords of Dissonence and Bellows on 1,2 and 3 with the melee<br/>
and inventory slots<br/>
            in 5 and 6 for easy swapping.<br/>
<br/>
Bank Six : No question for a level 28 Bard. Your Charm Bank needs to be<br/>
close to your battle banks.<br/>
           This is easy. Charm song in slot 1 followed by Pet command<br/>
keys /Pet guard me and /Pet Kill <br/>
           Slot 4 holds my Heal song. /Pet guard here and /Pet back off<br/>
are slots 5 and 6. I am still                    experimenting with<br/>
this. Input welcome.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps and I know that some others will have schemes that<br/>
they like better but I have tested this one and why reinvent the wheel<br/>
when you don&#39;t have to.<br/>
