<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705521568">Well I think we&#39;re all excluding one factor here, which I will call the<br/>
&quot;attentiveness&quot; factor.  Druids, Necros, Warriors, Clerics... most of these<br/>
classes you can have a fairly low attention level.  You may think I&#39;m crazy<br/>
but say you&#39;re soloing a Necro... you kill kill kill for 5 mins and then med<br/>
for 10, allowing you to afk, watch tv, knit, etc.  Clerics in a big raid<br/>
buff and heal ... all they have to do is keep an eye out for their party<br/>
members health - think about how most clerics say their class is &quot;boring as<br/>
hell.&quot;  Warriors, hit auto attack, and taunt and kick now and then.  <br/>
<br/>
Now of course on a big/important raid everyone is gonna pay attention.  And<br/>
ANY class where you are alert you will play better/use the class to its<br/>
fullest.  <br/>
<br/>
Bards though, you have to be THERE all the time, not lost in tells, not half<br/>
afk, not watching tv.. or things get nasty fast.  This is why i think people<br/>
burn out on bards quickly in general.  In my opinion the bard class is<br/>
pretty evenly balanced - prolly not perfect but nothing is... but you have<br/>
to be ATTENTIVE to play it even semi-well... and as time goes by in EQ, I<br/>
notice more and more people lacking attention.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that sort of makes sense :)<br/>

&gt; hehe if we&#39;re so overpowered why is it there&#39;s only 2 bards <br/>
&gt; in my guild<br/>
&gt; above 30? being me at 50 and another at 56?  Sure we have a <br/>
&gt; couple twinks in<br/>
&gt; the teens and 20&#39;s but that&#39;s just that, a twink... Well one <br/>
&gt; of em might be<br/>
&gt; leveling up to 50+ since his necro is 60. If we&#39;d be so <br/>
&gt; overpowered the<br/>
&gt; populations would be like that of a druid or necro soloers...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I laugh whenever someone says that bards are <br/>
&gt; overpowered.  The statement is ludicrous on its very face.  If that <br/>
&gt; were true, in a game dominated by the mechanics of level advancement <br/>
&gt; and ability to overpower foes, then there would be more than the flat <br/>
&gt; (100/14)% bards.  There are not.  It is not because bards are some <br/>
&gt; great secret either.  Sure a lot of people don&#39;t know all that bards <br/>
&gt; can do, but that is because it takes far, far more work to play a <br/>
&gt; bard than any other class.  Probably why I like them, they are much <br/>
&gt; more challenging.  Anybody can hit autoattack and the occasional <br/>
&gt; taunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When someone says Bards are overpowered, they&#39;re making a comparison <br/>
&gt; of a well played Bard vs. a well played &lt;whatever class&gt;.  That <br/>
&gt; comparison _ignores_ that Bards are inherently more difficult to play <br/>
&gt; well.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>
&gt; playing the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>
&gt; different comparisons, really.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;re saying, &quot;That&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and you&#39;re responding <br/>
&gt; with, &quot;That&#39;s silly, anyone can see that it&#39;s one of the smaller <br/>
&gt; fruits.&quot;<br/>
