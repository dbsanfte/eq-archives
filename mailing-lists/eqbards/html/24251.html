<div id="ygrps-yiv-122488200">i dunno, at least on saryrn pickup groups in the mid 50&#39;s still seem to be fairly<br/>
competent.  karnors sucks for exp, btw, you know that most of the mobs in<br/>
there range from 39 to the low 40&#39;s right?  i&#39;d suggest parking your bard in<br/>
sebilis and trying to get a group, and if that doesn&#39;t work, play your alt.<br/>
<br/>
if you only want to group with guild members then yes, you will have to join<br/>
a large guild if you expect to have a guild group every time you want to play.<br/>
however, as the guild gets larger, there are more and more people who aren&#39;t<br/>
all that good players in it as well, so at some point, you might as well just<br/>
join pickup groups, hehehehe.<br/>

&gt;Elfson is 52 now (would be pretty far into it too, cept for 2 unrezzed death<br/>
&gt;this weekend, ugh).  I recently left my small, &quot;family&quot; guild (it was<br/>
&gt;disbanding due to loss of many players). I joined a smallish (12-20 people<br/>
&gt;on during prime play, almost all 45+) guild where some of my other former<br/>
&gt;guild mates had gone.  I like almost  everyone in the new guild, but I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;thrilled with the way the guild does some things (I don&#39;t want to get into<br/>
&gt;specifics because there are a few Veeshan bards here and don&#39;t want to start<br/>
&gt;any trouble).  However, I basically only get to do things with guildies once<br/>
&gt;at week at most, so essentially I&#39;m still stuck in the same problem (I end<br/>
&gt;up in pick up groups in Karnors most nights) I had in my family guild. (I<br/>
&gt;was the highest lvl in the guild when I left).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what should I do?  Leave the guild and try to join a big powerful guild<br/>
&gt;(where I won&#39;t like many of the people, but at least I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>
&gt;guild stuff most of the time I play)?  Pretty much give up being able to<br/>
&gt;play after 50, and just play my cleric in my Thrusday night group (39 now)?<br/>
&gt;Something else?<br/>
