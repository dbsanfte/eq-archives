<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070611190">Okies, I&#39;ll go for it.  I&#39;ll use Verant&#39;s general idea of a bard as a start<br/>
though, don&#39;t want to start that whole why the heck can we wear plate<br/>
argument again.<br/>
<br/>
Primary:	Group buffs<br/>
Secondary:	Melee<br/>
Tertiary:	everything else<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t I think this is true currently?  Because Verant overvalues the<br/>
fact that our songs do not require mana.  To make it true would require them<br/>
to realize their error.  We should be able to group buff a party at 5 levels<br/>
or so below what the other buffers can do to make it truly a primary<br/>
ability.  Currently many of our buffs are so far behind the equivalent buffs<br/>
from other classes that unless the fighting is continuous it is better for<br/>
the other classes to buff up and med.<br/>
<br/>
Our melee is really too weak currently to qualify as a secondary.  I back<br/>
this opinion up by this experience.  I was grouped at one point with a<br/>
ranger and a shadowknight.  We agreed to test out our melee skills, letting<br/>
the monsters be the judges.  None of us cat any spells or used any abilities<br/>
except the ranger to snare mobs that had ceased to offer their opinion as<br/>
judges.  The result?  I did not take more than a single attack the entire<br/>
night in any fight.  In 4 hours of play I took maybe 150 points of damage.<br/>
The shadowknight won the contest but only barely.  He was attacked 54% of<br/>
the time, the ranger 46%.   The number of attacks on me was below 1%.<br/>
Granted the SK did have a sword that might be slightly more valuable than my<br/>
weapons but the ranger and I had an identical combo.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I put travel as tertiary is we are great errand runners.<br/>
Without teleport our travel really isn&#39;t up to snuff with druids and<br/>
wizards.<br/>
<br/>
The amount of RL finger twiddling that bards do to make their abilities work<br/>
is so far above that required by any other class, we might as well be<br/>
playing a different game.  I had a friend over last week who plays fairly<br/>
regularly with me, he&#39;s the ranger from the test actually although his<br/>
primary is now a druid.  When he saw the constant button manipulation<br/>
required by bards during combat he was stunned.  He had always agreed we<br/>
were a little underpowered, but felt all melee classes were.  When he saw<br/>
what we have to do to make our abilities function he though that anyone who<br/>
had to go through all that ought to see some benefit from it that was more<br/>
significant than we do.  He said he would rather just have mana than go<br/>
through all that constant finger waggling.<br/>
