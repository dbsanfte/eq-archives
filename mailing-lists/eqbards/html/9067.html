<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633136698">Yeah, I figured that but what on Norrath would have made it think I was<br/>
hostile and a bigger threat than the guy shooting it?  I wsn&#39;t casting<br/>
anything, was at full health, and wasn&#39;t even in a group.  The mob literally<br/>
turned at a 90+ degree angle after starting after the ranger and nailed me<br/>
from behind.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he saw the 40pp in the trade window that I was getting and needed to<br/>
pick up some cash ;(<br/>

&gt; I have a new good example of bard hate.  I am standing still with a trade<br/>

What you think is the mob&#39;s normal aggro radius may not be its<br/>
aggro radius in all situations.  If you&#39;ve ever tried to sneak<br/>
up on Chief Goonda in WK, you know that he has a *huge* aggro<br/>
radius (basically he charged me when he was about 5 pixels<br/>
large on my screen at 1024x768).  So it may be that while a<br/>
mob&#39;s initial aggro radius is small, once it has been<br/>
activated, the AI may be taking into account all potential<br/>
hostiles it sees within a much larger radius.<br/>
