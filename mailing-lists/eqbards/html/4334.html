Doesn&#39;t make anyone person right,  or wrong.  If everyone agreed on<br/>
everything this world would be very boring :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know what else I can do to prove the point.  Maybe I<br/>

&gt; As unfortunate as it sounds John, you may have to leave things be and let<br/>
&gt; the topic just die.  It is unfortunate because you have made some<br/>
&gt; extremely valid points, and they have illustrated a reason for the outlook<br/>
&gt; of all of my characters.  I have given up on the wonderful item<br/>
&gt; sweepstakes that are rampant on all servers and have settled down into<br/>
&gt; trying to RP and expand my character&#39;s background and story.  Without the<br/>
&gt; hunt for magical items, my drive to gain levels is all but gone.  Anyways,<br/>
&gt; just wanted to give you a pat on the back.  Someone read and listened.<br/>
