<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905746995">15 is an awkward level.  You can always hunt Wisps and zombies on wisp <br/>
island, (between eurdin and Qeynos) good money but minimal exp at 15.  I <br/>
financed my set of banded and my dirk that way.  Gnoll Reavers south of the <br/>
bridge in East Karana have good loot but the Velcro wolves make this a bit <br/>
dangerous.  Take a group of three or four depending on level.  On the other side<br/>
of the world you might try the Aqua goblins in Dagor&#39;s Cauldron, they have <br/>
pretty good loot, just avoid the Lords.  There is always crushbone and unrest <br/>
but these areas are very crowded.<br/>

at lvl 15,get good loot and not die?  I&#39;m so poor, I have yet to buy my lvl <br/>
11, 14, and 15 songs.  I am so poor that in order to make extra cash to <br/>
build up my smithing skill, I fish.  On the other hand, my fishing is 50 <br/>
now.  How you measure fishing skill I don&#39;t know, but I am AVERAGE in <br/>
fishing!<br/>

I do not mind being handed cash or sellable items but I won&#39;t use a given <br/>
item (unless its really nice, i.e. troll hide belt, blackened iron crown) <br/>
unless I&#39;ve done something for it. (big hint)<br/>
