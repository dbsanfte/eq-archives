<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have yet another bard project going *sigh* I know I know, I could<br/>
possibly<br/>
&gt; be addicted to the class. At any rate, I went to the Field of Bone at 8,<br/>
&gt; bringing only my level 9 song, surely I would die before 10 and could grab<br/>
&gt; Anthem from my bankbox in Firiona Vie then. Well, I did have to make a<br/>
trip<br/>
&gt; back to Kelethin to train dodge, but I am now level 11 and have yet to<br/>
die.<br/>
&gt; Field of bone is great, highly recommended for 9-12. Hunt the area between<br/>
&gt; the Swamp zone and the pit for 8 and 9, the pit itself for 10-11.<br/>
&gt; I have also been taking the oportunity to sing some Iksar folks songs in<br/>
&gt; /shout, to mixed reviews, they are not a very musical race (they attribute<br/>
&gt; this to having no ears). Here are a few I have found so far:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s what makes you not a mammal<br/>
&gt; That makes you dear to me<br/>
&gt; Your color patches are my favorite fun<br/>
&gt; When your flashing red and yellow<br/>
&gt; For all the world to see<br/>
&gt; My heart starts beating like I&#39;m layin<br/>
&gt; on a hot rock in the sun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your lips are soft,so soft my love,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s almost as if you are molting<br/>
&gt; My battle scars, and slight fungus collection<br/>
&gt; must surely leave you shy unto bolting<br/>
&gt; But you caught my eye e&#39;en before you grew limbs<br/>
&gt; and I set out to win you or die<br/>
&gt; And I built you this nest, and just look at these grubs!<br/>
&gt; Oh please wag your tail or I&#39;ll cry<br/>
&gt;<br/>
