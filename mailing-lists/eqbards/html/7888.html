<div id="ygrps-yiv-883937406">An excellent idea those mini-quests.  Now if only I could get Verant to<br/>
change my name to lt blue I could just stand near the gorge in E Karana.<br/>
<br/>
	Player: &quot;Hail Kitasi&quot;<br/>
	Kitasi: &quot;Greetings fellow traveller.  Fine weather we are having in<br/>
		   East Karana today.  Have you seen any [Crag Spiders]?&quot;<br/>
	Player: &quot;What about Crag Spiders?&quot;<br/>
	Kitasi: &quot;Well I want to make some armor.  I really need [Silk] to do<br/>
that&quot;<br/>
	Player: &quot;What about Silk?&quot;<br/>
	Kitasi: &quot;Bring me 4 Spider Silks and I will reward you with<br/>
handsomely&quot;<br/>
	Player: {Cool, a new quest lemme go find this guy some Spider Silks}<br/>
<br/>
	Its amazing what players will do for a quest and blow off an<br/>
/auction for the<br/>
	exact same thing.<br/>

&gt; If you got a Bracer of Erolissi for 5pp you should already consider<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rewarded, great job!  They routinely go for 50pp on E&#39;ci with 40 being<br/>

 </span></blockquote>woodsy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have come to realize the true value of the Bracer, although at the time of<br/>
the sale I did not. I think, perhaps, that the druid used the sale as a way<br/>
to gauge my newbie-ness and sincerity. When he saw that I was truly<br/>
ignorant, but honest, he knew he could trust me to hold his fortune for him<br/>
while he switched characters.<br/>
<br/>
I like other ideas I&#39;ve seen here and elsewhere to create mini-quests for<br/>
lower-levels so you and they feel they have earned their reward. It adds<br/>
roleplay and fun to the process, and weeds out the greedy, get-rich-quick<br/>
types.<br/>
