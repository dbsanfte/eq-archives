&gt; OK,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sitting around with some RL friends who play everquest, and <br/>
&gt; suddenly one of <br/>
&gt; them says &quot;by the way, your bard sucks now.&quot;  &quot;Eh?&quot; I say.  &quot;Yeah, we <br/>
&gt; played with a bard the other night, 58, who kept 4 songs <br/>
&gt; going most of the <br/>
&gt; fight and said when things get tough he twists in a fifth.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this BS?  Or do i really suck.  When I have a good <br/>
&gt; connection and low <br/>
&gt; lag I keep four going with few drops...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally stuck with 3 and only added the fourth when really really<br/>
needed..<br/>
<br/>
5? Pretty much impossible IMO<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I have one song per hotkey, and I hit 1122334411223344...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I started playing a bard in beta, and one thing that was added later which<br/>
could helped me - If I could have gotten used to it *grin* was to make<br/>
macros with something like this:<br/>
song1<br/>
/stopsong, pause xx? (Its been awhile since I fooled around with it so dont<br/>
remember the timing..)<br/>
/cast 1<br/>
<br/>
song2<br/>
/stopsong, pause xx <br/>
cast 2<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That way twisting can be done a bit simpler since each hotkey stops the<br/>
prior song before starting the next:<br/>
hit: song1, song2, song3, song1, song2, song3<br/>
<br/>
If you fizzle you have the small recast delay that is needed after stopsong,<br/>
but nothing like if you mapped several songs to one macro.<br/>
