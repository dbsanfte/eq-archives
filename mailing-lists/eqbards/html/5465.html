<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-925155924">Well it seems my accidental post amused and inspired a few of you.  Not to<br/>
be outdone, especially on the multiple-deaths-per-night thread, I submit<br/>
this for nomination for Norath&#39;s Worst Grouping Experience.  Sorry about<br/>
the length, which will probably get me kicked off the list, but, well, I<br/>
kept dying!  This happened about a month ago with my bard on Tunare, <br/>
Evulia, and her halfling druid friend Zenia, both level 7.  It was also<br/>
my first time in Blackburrow and my first time grouping with strangers.<br/>
<br/>
Zenia and I enter Blackburrow to the echoes of gnoll cries and screams<br/>
of anguish.  Bodies are strewn all around.  The air reeks of blood and<br/>
carnage.  We decend a short way into the depths of the burrow, tripping<br/>
over dismembered limbs we dare not try to identify.  We stop in a<br/>
hallway and spy a scrawny gnoll.<br/>
Zenia: This looks good.  Shall we take that scrawny?<br/>
me:  Aye.<br/>
We attack.  Another scrawny gnoll joins in.  I find myself getting<br/>
pushed around and can&#39;t stay focused on one gnoll at a time.  Singing is<br/>
near impossible.  Zenia watches her manna supply warily. Although we are<br/>
victorious, the battle lasts far longer than either of us had anticipated.<br/>
But before we are fully rested another battle ensues.  As I&#39;m being smacked<br/>
around by a gnoll and a patrolling gnoll, I watch in horror as a guard<br/>
bashes Zenia&#39;s head in.  Fighting now to avenge my friend, I jam a dagger<br/>
through the throat of one gnoll, only to die at the hands of the other.<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
Back at Qeynos we are joined by a ranger of the same age.  The ranger<br/>
claims he knows of a great spot where you&#39;ll see, at most, 2 guards and<br/>
2 regular gnolls.  No trains.  It sounds like paradise & we head off,<br/>
stopping briefly to loot our corpses.  Arriving at the ranger&#39;s hunting<br/>
grounds we are joined by a wizard.<br/>
Wizard: Hail<br/>
Others: Hail<br/>
Wizard:  OK, see that guard?  I&#39;m going to root him.  Zenia, you snare<br/>
him.  Then we&#39;ll all slaughter him.<br/>
Zenia:  Wait, medding.<br/>
The ranger and Zenia begin buffing the party.<br/>
Wizard:  OK, I&#39;m getting over to the other side of him now...<br/>
Ranger:  Wait, medding.<br/>
Wizard:  OK the coast is clear.  I think we can take this guy.<br/>
Ranger:  I&#39;m not at full manna yet.<br/>
Zenia:  Nor I<br/>
The wizard examines the gnoll guard from every angle, then hops around on<br/>
his toes, punching the air like a professional boxer warming up for a<br/>
fight.  I practice sense heading and forage for food.  Zenia and the<br/>
ranger finish medding.<br/>
Wizard:  Is everyone ready?<br/>
Zenia:  (standing back up) Aye, ready!<br/>
Ranger: All set<br/>
me: (stuffing an odd root I&#39;ve just dug up into my pack) Good to go!<br/>
Wizard: OK, Zenia will snare it first, then we all attack.<br/>
Zenia casts.  The guard attacks Zenia.  The ranger rushes to her<br/>
assistance.  I follow.  Another guard spawns and attacks the ranger.  A<br/>
regular gnoll spawns.  The ranger screams and falls.  Zenia screams and<br/>
falls.  I scream and fall.<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
I awaken outside Qeynos & see Zenia a few feet away.  I sit down next to<br/>
her and begin memorizing songs.<br/>
me: Hail<br/>
Zenia: Hail<br/>
The ranger awakens beside us.  He sits down and opens his spellbook.<br/>
Ranger: Hail<br/>
Zenia & I: Hail<br/>
Ranger: Did we all die?<br/>
me: (noting the wizard isn&#39;t in our zone) No, the wizard&#39;s alive.<br/>
We wait for eachother to finish memorizing our spells and head back to<br/>
retrieve our corpses.  Zenia and the ranger begin the whole<br/>
buffing/medding process again.  Another guard spawns.<br/>
Wizard: OK, see that guard?  I&#39;ll root him, Zenia will snare him, then<br/>
we all attack.<br/>
Ranger:  Am I the only tank?<br/>
me:  I&#39;ll tank as best I can.<br/>
Ranger: Yeah, you were hitting pretty good for a bit there...<br/>
Wizard:  Yeah, yeah, whatever.  Anyway, THIS time we all stay on the<br/>
first guard if others spawn, OK?  If we can all concentrate on one at a<br/>
time we&#39;ll manage.<br/>
Zenia:  We need more people.  I&#39;m going to see who I can get.<br/>
Zenia tries to enlist others while meditating and buffing.  I continue<br/>
practicing sense heading and forage for food.  The wizard wanders<br/>
restlessly over to the guard to make faces at it.  The ranger stands<br/>
up...<br/>
Ranger: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WOULD SOMEONE, ANYONE AT ALL, PLEASE COME<br/>
HELP ME???  I&#39;M BEGGING YOU!! PLEASE???<br/>
Zenia jumps to her feet!  I whirl around to face the ranger, gripping my<br/>
dagger tightly!  The wizard rushes back over to us, eyes flashing and<br/>
smiling like a madman!<br/>
Ranger: SORRY!! WRONG HOT KEY!! NO NEED OF ASSISTANCE!! SORRY!!<br/>
The wizard walks away pouting.  Zenia shakes her head and goes back to<br/>
medding.<br/>
me:  That&#39;s one hell of a hotkey!  What were you trying to do?<br/>
Ranger: (shrugging sheepishly) Forage?<br/>
Wizard:  HELP! HELP! WIZARD IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE!<br/>
After a moment&#39;s hesitation (understandable, I guess), we rush over to<br/>
discover a battle has begun between the guard and our wizard.  More<br/>
gnolls spawn.  Screams ring through the air.  The party cannot tell if<br/>
the blood that covers them is their own or their foes.  Beaten and<br/>
dizzy, I try to back away but am slaughtered.<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
Back at Qeynos I begin memorizing the tools of my trade.  With my nose<br/>
in the book, I didn&#39;t notice Zenia come up behind me.<br/>
Zenia: Hail.  Good news.  I got us a cleric.  He&#39;s on his way to the<br/>
others.<br/>
We head back.<br/>
Cleric:  Hail.<br/>
Zenia & I:  Hail.<br/>
Ranger:  (to wizard) You said if it ran to chase it!<br/>
Wizard:  No, I said if it ran I&#39;d root it and then you could go get it.<br/>
Ranger:  You told me to run!<br/>
Wizard:  Well it doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s dead now.  Just next time<br/>
wait for me to root it.<br/>
The wizard turns and walks away.  I watch with keen facination as tiny<br/>
daggers emerge from the ranger&#39;s eyes and head straight for the wizards<br/>
back.  Assuming this to be a ranger-only skill, I ask him what the<br/>
arguement was all about. The ranger just shakes his head.  Zenia, the<br/>
cleric, and the ranger begin buffing the party.  The wizard paces,<br/>
anxiously awaiting the next spawn.  I practice sense heading and forage<br/>
for food.  After a short wait, we&#39;re all buffed up and another guard<br/>
spawns.  We try using the same tactics.  These tactics work much better<br/>
now that we have 5 people in the party.  This time only one of us dies.<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
I relearn my songs yet again.  (I can now sing them backwords, in five<br/>
different keys, while breakdancing)  I return to our little battle<br/>
ground and the ranger announces he must depart.  No one looks<br/>
surprised.  Zenia and the cleric begin buffing the party.  Rather than<br/>
practice sense heading or forage for food I check my inventory.  I&#39;ve<br/>
made less than two gold and have ZERO experience to show for any of<br/>
this.  The wizard decides to rest very, very near the spawn point.<br/>
Zenia points this out to him.  He dismisses her with a wave of his<br/>
hand.  Zenia manages to enlist two more adventureres, but before they<br/>
can reach us another battle begins.  Two guards and two regular gnolls<br/>
spawn, and two of our bodies fall to the floor.  With my last breath I<br/>
laugh at the fact that the wizard&#39;s fell first.<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
Back at Qeynos, I awaken to find the wizard memorizing spells a few feet<br/>
off.  I sit down next to him and open my songbook.<br/>
me: Hail.<br/>
No response.  I begin relearning my songs.  When I&#39;m done I look over to<br/>
find the wizard has left without me.  Spitting Selo&#39;s, I head back to the<br/>
burrow.  Before reaching the entrance, Zenia asks me to meet up with<br/>
a brave, but young cleric from Erudin.  I spot him and introduce<br/>
myself and we wait for Zenia, who is fetching another druid from<br/>
Surefall.  Meanwhile we receive an informative group tell from the<br/>
wizard stating that, not only has another guardsman spawned, but that he<br/>
believes he&#39;s within a few kills of level 8.  I reply to the group that<br/>
I believe I&#39;m within a few deaths of level 6.  Finally Zenia arrives - <br/>
alone and cursing.<br/>
me:  Where&#39;s the druid?<br/>
Zenia:  Link dead.  I&#39;ll go get him if he comes back.  For now, let me<br/>
cast invisibility on you two and will head down.<br/>
She casts.  We enter.  We get separated by a train.  I fall into a pool of<br/>
water.  I try to find a shore to pull up onto but find it incredibly<br/>
difficult to navigate while invisible, particularly with zone&#39;s high lag.<br/>
I attempt to remove the invisibility, but don&#39;t know how.<br/>
Surefall Druid:  I&#39;m back.  Where are you?<br/>
Zenia:  I&#39;m coming for you now.<br/>
me: Umm, got a bit of a problem here.<br/>
Wizard:  Where is everyone??!!<br/>
Zenia:  I&#39;m getting the druid, I&#39;ll be right back.<br/>
Young cleric:  Where are you all?<br/>
Zenia:  (to younger cleric) What?  Didn&#39;t you follow me to the others?<br/>
Surefall Druid:  wtf?<br/>
Older cleric:  (to younger cleric) stay where you are, I&#39;m coming.<br/>
Wizard: (to the clerics) There are still some stray gnolls about.<br/>
Regular ones.  We can take them while waiting for the druids.<br/>
I finally manage to pull myself up onto a shore, only to discover I&#39;m<br/>
now wedged between two rocks. I&#39;m unable to turn or move in any direction.<br/>
me:  WTF???!!!  Umm, folks, I&#39;ve got a problem.  I&#39;m stuck.  Literally.<br/>
I&#39;m wedged between two rocks and can&#39;t move.<br/>
Older cleric: Where are you?<br/>
Zenia:  Hang on Eve, I&#39;m on my way!<br/>
Surefall Druid:  WTF???<br/>
Wizard:  Another guard&#39;s just spawned!<br/>
Young cleric: Where are the others?<br/>
me: I&#39;m at &lt;I give my LOC&gt;<br/>
Surefall Druid: (having just left the group) 6th level druid looking for<br/>
a REAL group!<br/>
Zenia:  Don&#39;t group with him.  He&#39;s impatient.<br/>
Wizard:  Hey, these guards are yellow to me now!<br/>
Older cleric:  I can&#39;t find Eve.<br/>
Zenia:  Try jumping or ducking, Eve.<br/>
I jump.  Nothing happens.  I duck.  I plunge back into the water and<br/>
back into my previous predicament - swimming while invisible.  I become<br/>
outstanding in swimming.  Finally invisibilty wears off and I head to<br/>
shore.  But for some reason everytime I climb up I fall back in AND get<br/>
injured by the fall.<br/>
Zenia:  Get up on shore already!<br/>
me: (taking my hands off the Look Up and Forward keys to reply) I<br/>
can&#39;t!  For some reason I keep falling back in!<br/>
Zenia:  Come up for air already!  Why&#39;d you swim back down to the<br/>
bottom?!<br/>
I don&#39;t bother to point out that I can&#39;t swim and reply at the same time<br/>
and instead make more vain attempts to beach myself.  Zenia jumps in the<br/>
water, swims up beside me, the climbs back on shore.  I hit the same<br/>
spot she does, climb up, then fall back in, injuring myself in the<br/>
process.  I try hitting every single spot on the shore.  Finally I hit<br/>
one spot and swim a good ten feet onto dry land before dropping safely<br/>
to my feet.  Flustered and shivering I follow Zenia back to the rest of<br/>
the party.<br/>
Wizard:  OK, I&#39;ll root this guard, Zenia can snare it, then Eve & the<br/>
clerics can hack away at it.<br/>
me:  Mind if I put my armor on first?<br/>
Zenia:  Don&#39;t use root.  It isn&#39;t working.<br/>
Older cleric:  Umm, I need to leave now.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to<br/>
stay but, umm, see, the owner of this phone line wants me to get off of<br/>
it.  There&#39;s nothing I can do.  Sorry.  Bye.<br/>
Wizard:  (Dismissing the older cleric with a wave of his hand) OK Zenia,<br/>
you just snare it and I&#39;ll start hitting it with other spells.<br/>
Young cleric:  Umm, Eve, do you have a healing song?<br/>
me: Yeah, but it&#39;s not all that powerful.<br/>
Wizard:  Hey, did I mention these guards are yellow to me now?<br/>
Zenia:  Aye, they&#39;re yellow to me as well.<br/>
me:  Still red to me.<br/>
Wizard:  I think I can take one by myself.<br/>
Young cleric:  You CAN&#39;T take one by yourself!<br/>
Wizard:  (dismissing the young cleric with a wave of his hand)  I really<br/>
do believe I can.  Without much difficulty.<br/>
Zenia:  Everytime we&#39;ve attacked others have spawned.  Do you think you<br/>
can solo two?<br/>
Wizard: (to cleric) Go over by where Eve is.  I&#39;m going to try soloing<br/>
this one.<br/>
Young cleric:  You&#39;re going to die...<br/>
The young cleric and I back up into the crevaces in the wall as far from<br/>
the guardsman as possible.  We have a silent competition to see who can<br/>
back themselves in further.  Being a wood elf, I win.<br/>
Zenia: At least wait until we&#39;re fully buffed and medded.<br/>
Wizard: (ignoring her) OK, here goes...<br/>
Young cleric:  I&#39;m not fully medded!<br/>
Zenia: WAIT!!<br/>
The wizard zaps the guard.  It attacks him.  The cleric stands up, takes<br/>
a step forward, then turns and looks to me.  I take a step forward, then<br/>
turn and look at the cleric.  Another guard spawns.<br/>
Wizard:  HELP! HELP! WIZARD IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE!<br/>
Zenia:  RUN!!<br/>
Zenia promptly follows her own advice.  I wait for the cleric to start<br/>
running, but instead he raises his weapon and joins the battle.  I start<br/>
to flee, then turn back cursing.  I can&#39;t leave the cleric to die.  I<br/>
begin to sing.  One of the guards immediately turns to me.<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
Back at Qeynos, Zenia tells me privately that the group will be<br/>
disbanding as soon as we get all the corpses back.  I check my<br/>
inventory.  Just under 3 gold, a couple patches of fur, and one copper<br/>
ring are all I have to show for the evening.  No experience.  I arrive<br/>
back at our hunting grounds and the wizard leaves the party.  There is<br/>
much rejoicing.  We make our apologies to the cleric, hoping to one day<br/>
fight with him again under better circumstances.  Then Zenia and I head<br/>
back to the hills.  On our way back to Qeynos a wolf begins nipping at<br/>
me.  I turn and stab at it, then remember I&#39;m in the company of a<br/>
druid.  I advice we make a dash to the zone before I find myself<br/>
knitting some small patchwork.  Zenia laughs.  I laugh.  Cros laughs.<br/>
