<div id="ygrps-yiv-489613162">Bone chips are pretty good money...  Practically every necro in my guild<br/>
says &quot;Time to go to Kurn&#39;s.&quot; when they run out of bone chips.  Going price<br/>
is 3-5pp per stack of 20, and practically every skel drops 1 or 2.  I swung<br/>
by there for chips for a necro friend (180 chips for 40pp) and then went<br/>
through the place sightseeing.  Occassionally a skel would agro on me even<br/>
at 51, and I expect that they will at 60 too.  Didn&#39;t see any named mobs,<br/>
but did see the throne room and the Burynai dungeon.  Didn&#39;t get far enough<br/>
in to find the porter to the outside.  I&#39;ll do that next time.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the sweetest most innocent thing while I was in there that really made<br/>
me harken back to my youthful days in EQ.  A 17th Iksar monk was on some<br/>
stairs Feigned and was being camped by a couple of skels.  He had low health<br/>
so I killed the skels and got got to talking with him.  He said he was<br/>
&quot;camping a skel whos rare drop was a pretty nice sword.&quot;  Well that got my<br/>
interest up, although I expected it to be a sword appropriate to the level<br/>
of the place...  Turns out he was camping the rare drop of -- Fine Steel<br/>
Scimitar.<br/>

&gt; thinking it might be a good place to look for Burynai Bundt Cake.<br/>
&gt;  Also some<br/>
&gt; of my guilds lower level member were thinking of trying it.<br/>
