<div id="ygrps-yiv-450654414">I am trying to use it (Curtailing) more and more - especially in Kith<br/>
against these dang hybrid Undead (caster-melee combos - I hate that when the<br/>
heal themselves - been trying to have lullaby or pixie ready for when they<br/>
drop into 2 bubs and then cast a heal).  I try to stick them with it right<br/>
away and a couple times.  Lower their MR so they resist the other songs<br/>
less.<br/>
<br/>
I am with druids a good bit and rangers too - have not heard them comment<br/>
that nerfs anything that they do DoT-wise.  Was just wondering if any thing<br/>
was known.<br/>
<br/>
My next thing to try is a series of song that can be drum enhanced.  Say<br/>
Anthem, Purifying, Curtailing.  This I think could be a good combo against<br/>
the Kith undead when you have 2 or 3 other melee-er&#39;s in your party.  If you<br/>
have good MR and sv Disease buffs already, then Chant, Warmth, Curtailing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have been thinking about varying the songs used throughout the<br/>
fight.  Open with: Anthem, Purifying, Guardian.  Let the mob get engaged<br/>
with tanks.  When the mob is getting stunned and bashed and I see<br/>
interuptions switch to: Chant, Warmth, Curtailing.  When the mob is going<br/>
down and turns to run: Chains, Anthem, Bellow. <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s 7 songs?  Anthem, Purifying, Guardian, Chant, Warmth, Curtailing,<br/>
Chains & Bellow.  Nope 8. Hmmm, have to drop one to make room for Clarity.<br/>
I guess it would be Bellow or Curtailing. Need to keep the one that is<br/>
resisted less.  Bellow would do 18 dmg in one series of song while<br/>
Curtailing should do 40? <br/>

<br/>
I have never received any party members saying that they could not cast a <br/>
spell on something that was under this songs influence.  Can you give an <br/>
example so I can include it in the song analysis?</div>
