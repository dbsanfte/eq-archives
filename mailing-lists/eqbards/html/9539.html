&gt; Around 7pm central time - I poked my head into the Kith zone and was<br/>
greeted<br/>
&gt; by a zone fight with some reds with new names.  Most everyone was fleeing<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the zone and when it was just me and 2 mobs left I stepped back into<br/>
safety<br/>
&gt; of west c.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then med, healed who ever needed some and we popped back in - but it was<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; &quot;day time&quot; such as it is in Kith.  People did their CR and kinda explored<br/>
&gt; but nothing was found.  I ran to RV for some banking and when I popped<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; in for the next night fall (9pm spawn game-time rumor) but alas - nothing<br/>
&gt; happened.  So I joined my reg group and headed for Lguk.  Saw a system<br/>
&gt; message saying something about the event being over (although the<br/>
reference<br/>
&gt; was to a different zone.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - that&#39;s all I know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not over in Qeynos Hills, all sorts of new undead.<br/>
Skeletal spearmen, level 6-7, they always have a rusty<br/>
spear and buckler (worth 4+ gp for the pair).<br/>
Skeletal Corporals, Level 7-8, with a rusty battle axe.<br/>
Skeletal Soldiers,  level &lt;5 (green to my Lvl 8 bard),<br/>
various rusty.<br/>
<br/>
I got clobbered by a skeletal monk, and had a Warbones<br/>
spawn on my head.  All in all, Paw is still better for the<br/>
next 3 bubbles.  In the course of 5 bubbles of exp around<br/>
the outside, and in the first 2 rooms, I&#39;ve picked up 12 pp<br/>
worth of rusty/cloth/wooden shields.  Plus it&#39;s usually<br/>
deserted (only bards seem to have the ability to exploit<br/>
that area at that level.)<br/>
