<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945738700">Find a warrior about your level and hit MM yes its train happy at times but<br/>
the Warr should be able to keep single pulls off ya and you and he can get<br/>
good xp due to the little down time.. Also had better luck using weaponsthan<br/>
my AoE songs there. Cazic was also good to me with similar strategy except I<br/>
needed bugger groups. HK is good xp but hard t get party.. weapons there as<br/>
well.. you dont wanna accidemntally AoE a guard.<br/>

&gt; I maintain EK is excellent for 22-about 26 or so :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I definitely recommend song/instrument combat v. weapons.  Song combat<br/>
&gt; means you save money on expensive weapons (unless they are gifts).  This<br/>
&gt; money can go towards better armor and your songs (instruments are cheap :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not certain that four song weaving is beneficial over three.  I tried<br/>
&gt; throwing in either bellow and/or chains with some twists.  Unless you can<br/>
&gt; minimize the time with just 3 song coverage (to one second or less), you<br/>
&gt; are probably losing more in terms of efficiency than you are gaining with<br/>
&gt; extra damage or slow down effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you zone into EK from Highpass, and go all the way down to the end of<br/>
&gt; the ramp, take a left, pass the named gnolls (carefully), there is a big<br/>
&gt; hill made of<br/>
&gt; rock which is crawling with rock spiders.  Usually, these are plentiful<br/>
&gt; and non camped.  Locate one, insult it with bellow, and lure it to an<br/>
&gt; isolated area (the zone edge nearest this mountain among the trees is<br/>
&gt; good).  Then twist away.  In general, stick to the spiders who /con low<br/>
&gt; blue rather than high...it makes a big difference.  If you get poisoned<br/>
&gt; early, take the spider to the barbarian guards in the village, and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; hesitate.  Make sure not to sing AE&#39;s around them :o)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tended to run later rather than earlier, and it was a while before I<br/>
&gt; learned the benefit of picking low blues...so I took some lumps.  If you<br/>
&gt; can find a single partner to hunt with (somebody who can cure poison,<br/>
&gt; preferrably), you&#39;ll do really well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay, so I&#39;ve got some good suggestions for where - now how about some<br/>
&gt; &gt; HOWs?  I mean, I&#39;ve nearly got the hang of 3-song weaving, (I&#39;m too<br/>
&gt; &gt; unreliable on 4) - do you recommend that or melee?  Also, is there any<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipment I should have or should start looking for?<br/>
