<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179060901">See, I think I&#39;m a bit sensitive about being a &quot;twink&quot; ... I have not<br/>
powerleveled my bard except with equipment and ok a little bit last night<br/>
with a druid friend.  I&#39;ve played my bard to 45, but I still have probably<br/>
not put in the hours that most of you have... I THINK I&#39;m a good bard, but<br/>
doesn&#39;t everyone think they are a good player? *giggles*...<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that caught me out of the blue was playing with my friends<br/>
alt monk (he plays a 60 mage normally) this weekend camping Raster.  We<br/>
could duo the area and it was nice and relaxing.   He started to tell me<br/>
what songs to play and I was like &quot;uh... I have been.. am I not doing well<br/>
or..?&quot; He replied that he wasn&#39;t really sure, just that he used to see 3<br/>
icons always blinking and now sees only two.  I had been playing celerity,<br/>
regen and chains... I asked if he knew that some bard songs that affect the<br/>
mob dont show up and he was like &quot;Oh, i didn&#39;t know that..&quot;  It surprised me<br/>
a bit.  I think that the general populace is probably pretty ignorant about<br/>
what abilities bards do and do not have.<br/>

&gt; other people tell me how to play mine, especially when I play <br/>
&gt; one of the<br/>
