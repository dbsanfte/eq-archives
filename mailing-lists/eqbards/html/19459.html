<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736466876">&quot;On numerous occasions the following has happened:  1)<br/>
initial chains wears off (yellow text message), 2) restart chains and get<br/>
the blue text message it sticks, 3) immediately get yellow text message<br/>
saying chains has wore off again.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually this happens with all spells, its a general spell bug, if something<br/>
wears off the exact same time as you recast it, it doesn&#39;t work. You get the<br/>
wore off, success , wore off combo. Get really annoying as a caster when<br/>
casting shielding spells and other self-buffs. But verant MUST know about it<br/>
as I reported it as a bug about 10 times before now ;)</div>
