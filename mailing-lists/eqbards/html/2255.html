<div id="ygrps-yiv-197508731"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;was wondering if anyone can give me hint as to the gnoll that carry a<br/>
&gt;Tomahawk and what lvl is it?  I am currently lv 19.  I just want to know at<br/>
&gt;what lvl should I start getting a group together and go and kill it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was lucky to get mine at 16th level, working with a group, but I WAS<br/>
lucky, you are plenty high enuff, You need to go to HHpass and near the arch<br/>
at the EK entrance there is a path that goes up the left side of the ridge<br/>
to the top of that arch, the Named gnoll (something Mucktail) spawns up<br/>
there, along with alot of gnoll brawlers, champions, soothesayers and<br/>
Flamepaws.  A good group is needed and a spellcaster is too, this area is<br/>
Camped and Kill stealing is the rule not the exception due to the VERY slow<br/>
spawn rate, Ive been there for 4+hours only to have no spawn, when I got<br/>
mine I was there for 5 min and he spawned twice. And he spawns with nothing<br/>
sometimes, and he spawns with the Darkwood shield which is possibly just as<br/>
good as the Tommy to some people (Druids and Clerics).<br/>

&gt;Yes, a combine weapon is magical. They are nice weapons, but what you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>should<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;really look into getting is a Dragoon Dirk. If my database of weapons is<br/>
&gt;up-to-date, it would appear that there is only ONE combine weapon better<br/>
&gt;than the Dirk....The 2 Handed Combine Sword. All I can say is...DIRK ROCKS.<br/>
&gt;I just had the absolute BEST fortune to pick one up for free last night. I<br/>
&gt;think I will be very happy with it indeed...<br/>
