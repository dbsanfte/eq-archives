&gt;Ok, I have a question for you all.  I am a level 25 Bard on the Rallos Zek<br/>
&gt;server.  I have read with interest your emails, suggestions, and tips, but <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;seem to have a problem.  I can not use the same songs in the same way as<br/>
&gt;you.  My sleep song puts EVERYONE but my party to sleep, including other<br/>
&gt;players, in fact any NON Party song effects mobs and players.  This is a<br/>
&gt;real disadvantage to me I believe.  Anyone on RZ with any suggestions? Or<br/>
&gt;anyone else ?  Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is happening because you are on a pvp server i think. I jumped on <br/>
Rallos Zek during beta while my regular server (Fennin Ro - BLAH) was down <br/>
just to see what it was like. Of course i was getting beat up by some pk <br/>
monk in the newbie zone, but after i made lvl 2 it actually was kinda fun. I <br/>
would sing dissonance and strafe around him, and he couldn&#39;t keep up with me <br/>
(quake skills CAN be useful in EQ I guess when fighting other players).<br/>
I also was talking to a group who wanted me to join them and had wince on. <br/>
They were panicing cuz they didn&#39;t know why they were takng damage (all of <br/>
them). Of course after I joined the group they no longer took damage. You <br/>
just have to be careful with it on Zek.<br/>
