I got my Flowing Black Silk Sash last night, and I only had to camp an hour<br/>
for it. I got invited into the Frenzie group at about 7pm, we broke the<br/>
spawn in the room (3 Bloodthirsty Ghouls). The next spawn was the Frenzied<br/>
Ghoul, we killed him (quite easily infact) and the leader looted. Then I<br/>
saw the word &quot;Sash&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My heart was pumping so fast as I had the chance of winning this fabled<br/>
item. The first person rolled and only got a 21. I then rolled and it came<br/>
up 90, the excitement of this was amazing. But, I was still hoping no one<br/>
beat my roll. I sat there as people rolled and low numbers were appearing,<br/>
33, 12, 39 and 28. I had won, I was now the owner of a loooooverly sash. I<br/>
equipped it and immediately noticed the difference during the first fight.<br/>
Sash + Celerity makes me attack very fast.<br/>
<br/>
Well, there you have it. The quickest 20k I have ever earned.  =)<br/>
