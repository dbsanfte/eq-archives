<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490492850">The nerf on the Donal&#39;s makes perfect sense to me.  It is too powerful an<br/>
item.  They have also mentioned that were going to look at tuning down those<br/>
high velious mobs that require the BP.  I wish people would read the ENTIRE<br/>
post and not just the parts that upset them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see why everyone is so mad about this change.  They put in an item<br/>
that ended up being more powerful then they expected, so they are tuning it<br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda takes the challenge out of the mob doesn&#39;t it?  Get a cleric in your<br/>
group with the BP and one warrior can take any, and I mean ANY mob that does<br/>
not outright kill  the warrior in 30 seconds.  As longs as your cleric can<br/>
click fast enough.  Kinda ruins the game.  There is more to this game that<br/>
the ph4t l33t.  Otherwise it would be dead now.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, the way they were talking about nerfing it, still makes it a powerful<br/>
item.  The cleric could still completly heal the party in 3 minutes (no<br/>
change here from the original BP), after that the first person has 4.5<br/>
minutes (or whatever they set as the buff time) before they can have the BP<br/>
used on them, again.  Not bad, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Well, flame all you want.  I don&#39;t care, I support the change.  It&#39;s good<br/>
for the game as a whole.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Well honestly, the nerfs to Donals are NOT justified, in my opinion,<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; they have stated that many of the Velious mobs were designed with those<br/>
BPs<br/>
&gt; in mind.  They hit for ungodly amounts and quickly and have insane amouts<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; HP themselves like 200k.  If they downscale these mobs then maybe I would<br/>
&gt; support the nerf but if not, well the increase in CR time alone will begin<br/>
&gt; to make the game unpalatable to me.  But then I&#39;m in a bad mood today :P<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;d heard about the nerf to Donal&#39;s which is probably well<br/>
&gt; &gt; justified, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; not about Complete Heal.  What are they planning on doing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Complete Heal?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I see the Eq Casters&#39; post said defensive skillS, wonder if<br/>
&gt; &gt; they really<br/>
&gt; &gt; meant Defense skill only?  I can think of some other minor<br/>
&gt; &gt; tweaks I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; &gt; to see to bard skills, skill caps come to mind.<br/>
