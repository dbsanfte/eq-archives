<div id="ygrps-yiv-566906471">i dueled a level 50 ranger twice, once with weapons and once without.  he<br/>
won both times pretty handily, though i even did slightly more damage with<br/>
the lute than with the weapons.  there are two things i would like to try in<br/>
the future though.  he was in full thorny vine, with 2 ykeshas and a haste<br/>
sash.  i had yet to complete my imbrued armor set.  now that i have<br/>
completed my armor set, as well as acquiring a haste sash, having our high<br/>
level songs not miss as much, and having a lute from the plane of hate, i<br/>
would love to try again.  against melee classes we are often toast, but<br/>
against casters we have too many resources.  my motto is if they can&#39;t cast,<br/>
they can&#39;t win =)<br/>
