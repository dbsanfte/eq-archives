&gt; I suppose that is a good enough topic for this question.<br/>
&gt;Last night, I<br/>
&gt; saw a bard playing a song that I thought I had never seen<br/>
&gt;before. I<br/>
&gt; found out that it was Selo&#39;s, but it looked different than<br/>
&gt;when I play<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s. It had the white pulsing flashes, but it also had<br/>
&gt;small purple<br/>
&gt; lights or something. When does Selo&#39;s start to look<br/>
&gt;different? Anyone<br/>
&gt; know?<br/>
