<b>Subject:</b> Rumor of the bards ultimate weapon? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209904895">A fellow bard has heard rumor of a bard only &quot;ultimate&quot; weapon called the <br/>
quill that procs gate.  He says it is found in the Plane of Hate on the <br/>
Maestro of Rancor.  I&#39;m skeptical by nature but he also sent me along a <br/>
screenshot of this Maestro character in front of a huge organ.  Anyone else <br/>
hear about this?  I&#39;ve got the screenshot if anyone wants to see it.<br/>
