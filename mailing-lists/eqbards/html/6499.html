<div id="ygrps-yiv-579156118">A week or two ago the general consensus was that our Invis song working<br/>
against undead was a function of your level compared to the undead mobs<br/>
level.  John Kim posted festering hags conned indifferent to him but at 22d<br/>
level they conned ready to attack to me.  For me at 22d level, Invis worked<br/>
against lower level carrion ghouls but the not against the tougher ones.<br/>
Ghouls et al yard trash in Unrest could never see me.  Are you saying that<br/>
with the recent patch the Invis song does not work against any undead?<br/>
