We better stop this thread since it isn&#39;t about bards and we&#39;ll cause alot<br/>
of people to have to scroll through too much mail to read the important<br/>
stuff.  Sorry<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am talking about items for sale.   And it may be easy for you to find<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; but not everyone that reads these lists are as computer literate as some<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; us.  It is not that much more difficult to type out the word when<br/>
&gt; posting to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see any problem with using words/acronyms that are common<br/>
&gt; knowledge in-game, when out of game and talking about the game. Very very<br/>
&gt; very few people don&#39;t know what RTS is. If they don&#39;t, they&#39;re gonna learn<br/>
&gt; pretty fast when playing. Therefore I consider it common knowledge. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my book, it&#39;s the same as acting as if it&#39;s bad for me to say &#39;the<br/>
&gt; ranger guild&#39;. Someone out there, somewhere, might not know that the<br/>
&gt; ranger guild is in Surefall and Kelethin. So therefore, according to the<br/>
&gt; no-acronyms logic, I should explain the locations of them since someone<br/>
&gt; might know them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And when you get into explaining everything because someone somewhere<br/>
&gt; might not know it..<br/>
