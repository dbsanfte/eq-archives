&gt; Check this quote about exploits:<br/>
&gt; Farming - using broken spells or specific spell effects to kill, drag, or<br/>
&gt; lure monsters, thus gaining experience/loot from them. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Warning Rant follows.<br/>
<br/>
What specific spell effects??, this is not defined. Perhaps using a <br/>
shock of frost is one of those &quot;specific spell effects&quot; and to use <br/>
shock of frost to kill a mob is an exploit. Who knows cause Verant <br/>
tell us bugger all.<br/>
<br/>
What spells are broken??. When has Verant ever said a spell is <br/>
broken. Currently there is no such thing as a broken spell.<br/>
<br/>
So my reading of their &quot;exploit policy&quot; is this. <br/>
<br/>
Verant are not going to tell you what are exploits because we dont <br/>
know ourselves. But we will send  GM&#39;s around to stop anybody <br/>
doing what we dont like. Again we wont know what we dont like <br/>
until we see it. When we see you doing IT we will warn you and if <br/>
you do IT again we will ban you, but if we dont catch you then it is <br/>
OK for you to do IT. Unless the IT becomes widespread and then <br/>
will we ignore that IT, because Verant acknowledges that Verant <br/>
cant ban to many people as it is bad for business.<br/>
