<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069047241">NPC&#39;s have limited mana - they just have much more to start out with.  You<br/>
can see it when you have long fights with healers.  As they run low on mana<br/>
they switch to smaller heals. After several &quot;... feels much better&quot; you<br/>
begin to see &quot;....feels better&quot; as they run low on mana.  Also, a tactic for<br/>
Lady Vox is to mana sieve her so that she does not have enough left to<br/>
complete heal when she gets low on health.<br/>
<br/>
Mana drain songs have generally been regarded as poor choices for anything<br/>
except PvP because groups typically kill mobs so quickly. Maybe if you and 1<br/>
or 2 others are fighting creatures with mana it could help but it seems like<br/>
a very poor choice (both as a song to use and as a &quot;new song&quot; to improve the<br/>
game.)<br/>

There are two mana drain songs in this list...which makes me wonder if<br/>
Velious creatures will actually have a limited mana pool.</div>
