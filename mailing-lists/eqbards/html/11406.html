<div id="ygrps-yiv-867546982">Most of that is a bunch of BS.<br/>
<br/>
+There are no stat bonuses ADDED to any instruments.<br/>
<br/>
+They added the mail delivery quests that everyone can do, and the lambent<br/>
quests , but everyone got a new armor quest to deal with the rubicite<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
+Class specific items? What from POF and POH? How many? 4?<br/>
<br/>
+Know nothing about the pet thing<br/>
<br/>
+Additional affects to bard songs? Bahh! more like took affects away.<br/>
<br/>
+Added songs? We never had all 50 to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
+We can now punch magic only creatures with magic gloves on for 5 damage 35<br/>
delay. I couldn&#39;t do that back in April, but I wish I could have because it<br/>
would have really helped me ;-P<br/>
<br/>
+Increased the power of some songs? Hrrm, the power for Fufils was<br/>
supposedly increased but it is the same as it ever was.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to rant, but give me a break.  What do they take us for?<br/>

&gt; Check out this thread. I posted these comments. Anyone else <br/>
&gt; agree with me?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few observations. Would like a response<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + Added stat and other bonuses to instruments<br/>
&gt; Where? None of my instrument stats changed for the better IE: <br/>
&gt; Bonus? means<br/>
&gt; something added, right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + Added more Class Specific Quests<br/>
&gt; Lambent. How about some more? Instruments and such. as it is, <br/>
&gt; besides The<br/>
&gt; lambent, bards have some pretty poor quests. (4 I think)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + Added more Class Specific Items<br/>
&gt; Again, We have very few class specific items. I think they <br/>
&gt; added a grand<br/>
&gt; total of 5<br/>
&gt; Look at warriors. They have millions;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + Corrected Bug that let monsters attack you from far <br/>
&gt; distances through your<br/>
&gt; pet<br/>
&gt; Didnt know this was an issue, since charm only lasts ten seconds<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + Added Addition Effects to Some Bard Songs<br/>
&gt; Forgot to mention that Levitate will not work now. Would like <br/>
&gt; to know what<br/>
&gt; effects were added<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + Added New Bard Songs<br/>
&gt; New bard songs?, or do you mean, fixed ones that didn&#39;t work?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + Added Ability for Bards to Punch &#39;Magic Only&#39; Creatures<br/>
&gt; I thought I could always do this, with magic gloves<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + Increased the Power of Some Bard Songs (c.f. Chant Series,<br/>
&gt; Fifil&#39;s, etc.)<br/>
&gt; Hmm, I have not seen any &quot;Increase&quot; in power of bard songs, <br/>
&gt; only a decrease<br/>
&gt; (IE Lullaby, Lament, Pixie strike, Selo&#39;s) Shouldn&#39;t there be <br/>
&gt; a negative in<br/>
&gt; here?<br/>
&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
