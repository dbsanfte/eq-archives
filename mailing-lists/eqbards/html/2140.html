<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383779700">Someone was asking about Lake Rathe but I accidentally deleted it before<br/>
I responded.<br/>

This is a great zone for Bard&#39;s (outside, almost no guards and none<br/>
where it could be a problem).  Get a decent map at Everlore.com<br/>
<br/>
I gained two and a half levels here in two days fighting Aviak Guards.<br/>
The loot was nothing special, but the spawn rate was so fast that it<br/>
added up nicely.  The experience is the real high point.  I wish I had<br/>
come to this zone at level 16 with a full party.  If I had, I could have<br/>
stayed there until level 23 slowly reducing the size of the party.  I<br/>
could probably stay here until 24, but the mobs are mostly green now<br/>
(still died yesterday when a bunch of Orcs jumped on my back and drowned<br/>
me---BUG!&lt;g&gt;).  There are other mobs to fight beside Aviak Guards that<br/>
are lower levels (orcs, bandits, aviaks, gnolls, undead, undead<br/>
gnolls).  The area right by the zone to South Karanas is a little scary<br/>
at night when the undead and undead gnolls spawn, but they also attract<br/>
a lot of campers that keep it cleared out.<br/>
<br/>
You can get bound in the Arena zone adjacent to this zone.  There are<br/>
some Gypsies in the zone that you can sell to.<br/>
