<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127731321">Bard crowd-control mid-levels, stuff to add .. I tend to crowd control a lot<br/>
. I like it heh.<br/>
<br/>
I have always kept charm and mez memmed on CC duty.  Esp. with the second<br/>
mana using charm.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things to note ..<br/>
 - have a pet attack hotkey .. charm is too short by the time you&#39;ve<br/>
targetted the mob to attack to worry about typing (I also have more messages<br/>
here so groups know what I did)<br/>
- when using the second mana-using charm .. its level cap makes it useless<br/>
on yellows and reds .. switch to Pixie for those<br/>
- when charming .. beware of pet classes&#39; pets in your group .. if the<br/>
timing is off the pets can hit eachother and then the party-members pet will<br/>
hit YOU<br/>
- some groups (no matter how many socials) just can&#39;t work with charm .. but<br/>
do great on mez<br/>
- some groups can&#39;t assist to save thier lives (and it would too!) .. if<br/>
possible charm-only<br/>
- put /g socials in your charm mez and pet attack keys to help groups adjust<br/>
to what you are doing and the whole idea of the Bard doing crowd control<br/>
- ask for cha buffs when you can :)  even with a chanter present .. if it<br/>
gets ugly and the chanter goes down .. one resist may be all you get!<br/>
- make sure the group healer(s) is aware you&#39;re doing crowd-control! and is<br/>
willing to support you<br/>
<br/>
Assuming the groups can adjust to you being the crowd-control, I don&#39;t need<br/>
extra AC/HPs .. but I&#39;ve had good healing in groups that treated my health<br/>
with the same care of an enchanters (and IMHO we don&#39;t get the stun, but we<br/>
do have AC - so we will take more hits than a chanter but we take less<br/>
damage when hit and don&#39;t go oom - so its a wash).  Granted, thats a big<br/>
assumtion. :(   When the group healers think of me as a tank thats &quot;trying a<br/>
bit of light crowd control&quot; that I usually die so fast they go &quot;huh?&quot;.   If<br/>
the healers can mentally switch with you when you go from assitant tank to<br/>
the crowd-contoller on duty .. you&#39;ll be fine in cha not AC gear.<br/>
