On the subjest of being dark elf bards, I met a GM troll in beta that shared <br/>
that feeling that evil races should have bards, but alas it is not to be. <br/>
What you can do, when you get to lower guk is get yourself a Mask of the <br/>
Deceiver. This is another bard/rogue equipable items that casts an illusion <br/>
of dark elf race on you. It also is +9 to charisma I believe, can&#39;t remember <br/>
the exact stats. Alot of the higher level barbarians want these since they <br/>
also reduce your size which can be life saving in Sol. They can&#39;t equip it <br/>
but they can use the spell on it. It also allows some race/classes to enter <br/>
the evil cities. I haven&#39;t played with one myself yet, they are no drop/no <br/>
trades, but I know several people who have them.<br/>
As far as halflings go, I am sorry but I avoid Rivervale when possible. The <br/>
residents are always trying to steal my purse or pinch me or both! And the <br/>
music in Rivervale, argh! Give me HighHold any time, I&#39;ll take my chances <br/>
with the Mucktails.  ;)<br/>
