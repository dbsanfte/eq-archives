<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-367588319">As far as I can tell this started happening after the patch was applied to<br/>
put a cast time on activatable items to prevent chain casting.  I used Psalm<br/>
of Cooling in LGuk with the mask before that patch and it did not cancel out<br/>
the mask&#39;s UV affect.  While its not a big deal it is a bug and we should<br/>
probably send it in.<br/>
<br/>
Just to reiterate since I seem to be brainless today and the thread is<br/>
getting confusing, here is what you can do to reproduce the bug:<br/>
<br/>
1. Right click you mask to cast illusion, note the blue tinge of UV.<br/>
2. Begin to sing Psalm of Cooling, let it pulse at least once, then stop it.<br/>
3. When the icon for Psalm fades, so will your UV.<br/>
4. Recast the mask illusion and you get UV back.<br/>

&gt; Ah. Well that would be annoying, fortunately for me, I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; use that song<br/>
&gt; all that often in any dark area that I&#39;ve travelled. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But yes, I could see why the Psalm&#39;s UV effect would <br/>
&gt; overwrite the masks<br/>
&gt; effect. This is pretty much par for the course though with <br/>
&gt; bard songs, as<br/>
&gt; they do conflict with a number of other buffs as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wonder if this is intentional or just one of those bugs?<br/>
