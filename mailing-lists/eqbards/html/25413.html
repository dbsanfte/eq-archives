&gt;I think its cool that a guild would be attempting this, but if the warders<br/>
&gt;dont respawn, then to me, bites,  and will have an impact on the entire<br/>
&gt;server community, not just ew, dw and vv but futur guilds that would like to<br/>
&gt;go to ST as well... Take Rathe for example, it supposedly has had no warder<br/>
&gt;spawn since the sleeper was awakened.  :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I might have my info wrong, I might not, either way I hope they dont go<br/>
&gt;away.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> From what I&#39;ve read at Lum&#39;s that does seem to be the trend.  The Sleeper <br/>
won&#39;t be awakened any more until they decide.<br/>
