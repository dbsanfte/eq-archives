the Trilateral Commission whose mission is to brainwash us by flashing<br/>
subliminal messages on the textures of every single mob in the game. Notice<br/>
the next time you die to a mob that you have killed easily before that you<br/>
have a sudden desire to have beer and/or ice cream. These were the &quot;beta&quot;<br/>
messages that never got removed. The latest ones involve replacing the US<br/>
Constitution with the UN Charter and a removal of the Gold Standard.<br/>
They will stop at nothing, my sources tell me that the &quot;Kunark Upgrade&quot; is<br/>
really  an intense propaganda upgrade which will somehow seek to rob us of<br/>
our precious bodily fluids.  Worldnetdaily, widely respected as the voice of<br/>
calm reasonable consideration, is recommending everyone not install it.<br/>
