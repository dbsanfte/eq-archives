<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369014183">The bard quests may be easy at 30th level, but I have not found them<br/>
particularly easy at 20ish.  On the other hand I completed my fourth shaman<br/>
piece last week with my 21st level bard, and I did all the required killing<br/>
myself for 3 of the pieces.  I&#39;ve also done 3 crafted quests, including the<br/>
slaying required, and 1 ranger piece.  I&#39;m halfway thru about 5 bard pieces.<br/>
If you think our quests are easy try some of the others, they make ours look<br/>
many levels off for me.<br/>
<br/>
I have had no luck getting the icy greaves despite trying four times now.<br/>
I&#39;ve spent about 6 hours in the king room with no luck.  I know others have<br/>
been more fortunate on this note, but since the critters involved are still<br/>
far beyond my means for almost all the bard quests, while the critters for<br/>
some of the other classes&#39; quests are not, I don&#39;t believe ours are as weak<br/>
as people seem to think.  Our quests are relatively easy for the level<br/>
Verant seems to think should be doing the quests (30-35).  Other classes can<br/>
get some pieces 10 levels before this easily although some of their pieces<br/>
may be fairly difficult.<br/>

Admit it, the bard quests are much too easy.  I don&#39;t know how many of<br/>
my items I got by just entering a zone, ooc&#39;ing that I needed an item for<br/>
the bard quests, please let me know if you find one, and then walking out<br/>
15 minutes later with the item...<br/>
