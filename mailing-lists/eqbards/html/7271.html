&gt; No, if you train at your GM for one point you don&#39;t get Excellent.  :)<br/>

&gt; I have not tested it, but I assume you get (level at which the skill <br/>
&gt; appeared on the trainer&#39;s list) + 1 skill points, which translates to <br/>
&gt; awful or some such (don&#39;t remember the category names, but suffice it to <br/>
&gt; say, you stink at it.  hehe)<br/>

<br/>
Given:<br/>
<br/>
- Your skill is awful when you first train it.<br/>
- You need a teacher who is excellent to train it up to excellent.<br/>
- Everyone started the game at level 1 and awful at everything.<br/>
<br/>
How did the first person who got a language skill to excellent<br/>
get it to excellent?<br/>
