<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872528801"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m not too concerned if I couldn&#39;t have gotten more out of it.  For one<br/>
&gt; thing, I&#39;ve never been offered more than 7 pp for those HQ bear skins.  For<br/>
&gt; another thing, FS weopons cost a lot more than I can afford from vendors,<br/>
&gt; and I had killed enough bears that I didn&#39;t mind trading one of the skins<br/>
&gt; away.  I still have more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  There&#39;s only one thing a HQ bear pelt is good for, and you&#39;ve got to<br/>
  understand that higher level players have at least a little money to<br/>
  throw around.  Don&#39;t feel bad if you are asking more than what you <br/>
  think the worth of something is, regardless of how easy it was to<br/>
  acquire.<br/>
<br/>
  Tailors sells 10 slot backpacks for 75pp+ (I&#39;ve seen them at 125pp)<br/>
  And the tailor needs those (very rare) HQ bear pelts to charge that<br/>
  much to those people who want the packs.  Those pelts are worth <br/>
  minimum... 10pp, and that&#39;s very low.  I see them sold for around<br/>
  20-25pp average, but look at the profit the tailor makes, you could<br/>
  charge more for the pelts.  What&#39;s he gonna say, I&#39;ll go buy those<br/>
  pelts from someone else?  Just laugh at them, those pelts are rare.<br/>
<br/>
  Trust me, a L50 cleric, L50 shaman, and me cleaned Rathe Mountains<br/>
  for 2 or 3 hours of bears and got only one HQ pelt.  That&#39;s about<br/>
  200-300 bears dead.<br/>
