&gt; the total damage that will be dished out.  You will need to start and stop<br/>
&gt; songs - stop your melee attack - stand and take a couple rounds while the<br/>
&gt; others taunt and build hate - step back and scrape the mobs onto your<br/>
&gt; partners - equip lute and heal in combat (esp heal your self back up) then<br/>
&gt; dive back in and taunt the mob with songs to pull it off the others, etc<br/>

(L36-42 by our estimate), I found that if I attacked with<br/>
weapons and played more than one song, it would attack me.  If<br/>
I left just one song playing I was safe.  I let myself get<br/>
beat down to two bubbles once to see if the others could taunt<br/>
it off me but it didn&#39;t seem they could.  So I ended up<br/>
playing just my instruments and punching (and it *still*<br/>
attacked me from time to time).<br/>
