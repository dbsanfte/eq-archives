(L36-42 by our estimate), I found that if I attacked with<br/>
weapons and played more than one song, it would attack me.  If<br/>
I left just one song playing I was safe.  I let myself get<br/>
beat down to two bubbles once to see if the others could taunt<br/>
it off me but it didn&#39;t seem they could.  So I ended up<br/>
playing just my instruments and punching (and it *still*<br/>
attacked me from time to time).<br/>
