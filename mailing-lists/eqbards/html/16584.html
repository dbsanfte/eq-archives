As a former Sr. Guide I can tell you that your server&#39;s GM is extremely busy<br/>
every day and emails often get lost.  My best advice is to email to<br/>
&lt;servername&gt;@... with a reminder that you are still waiting for<br/>
help.  If that doesn&#39;t get a response within about 3 days send an email to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jbutler@...">jbutler@...</a> simply stating that you have been unable to get in touch<br/>
with your gm regarding an issue that they stated they would work with you<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t flame and try to stay calm when writing.  Jeff Butler is a really<br/>
reasonable guy and sincerely wants to help.  But if he gets his back up he<br/>
can be a pain.  Be polite but firm and remind him that the GM told you to<br/>
get in touch with them and that you have yet to hear back.<br/>
<br/>
That is the best way to get help when this happens.<br/>
<br/>
Remember:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Servername@...">Servername@...</a> (Sends an email to your server&#39;s Senior(s), GM and GM<br/>
Lead Admin)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jbutler@...">jbutler@...</a> (Sends an email directly to Jeff Butler, VP of Customer<br/>
Support at Verant)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know who I can write/talk to if my GM hasn&#39;t responded to me<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; three weeks?  Some of you may remember that I had a lore container poof<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; some items that didn&#39;t belong to me.  Our head GM asked me to write her an<br/>
&gt; email.. which I did.  After not hearing from her in three days I wrote<br/>
&gt; another and still have heard nothing.  I petition regularly when I&#39;m<br/>
online<br/>
&gt; but the only resopnse I get is &quot;I&#39;m sure Kyrani will get to it.&quot;  Well, I<br/>
&gt; think I&#39;ve been patient but perhaps I&#39;m not giving them enough time.  And<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; she doesn&#39;t respond, is there anywhere else to appeal?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
