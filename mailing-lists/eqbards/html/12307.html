<b>Subject:</b> The Summoning of Mayong Mistmoore (E&#39;ci server) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-666293965">For the E&#39;ci bards:<br/>
<br/>
The guildmaster of the Kelethin Songweavers Guild decided enough was enough.<br/>
He had just gotten word of another bard messenger slain in Lesser Faydark.<br/>
That made four over the past two weeks.  Like all the others, the puncture<br/>
wounds of a vampire attack were visible on the messenger&#39;s neck.  It<br/>
appeared that the rumors coming out of Lesser Faydark were true, Mayong<br/>
Mistmoore was back on the prowl.  <br/>
<br/>
For months, numerous intrepid adventurers had entered into Mayong&#39;s estate<br/>
only to find him mysteriously in hiding.  Despite forays deep into the<br/>
bowels of Mayong&#39;s fortress, evidence of his existence were nowhere to be<br/>
found.  The reports of his absence conflicted directly with the evidence:<br/>
four dead bards.  If only Mayong could be taunted to appear, then perhaps<br/>
Norrath could be rid of his evil presence once and for all.  <br/>
<br/>
Knowing of Mayong&#39;s deep hatred of bards, what better way, the guildmaster<br/>
decided, to taunt him into appearing than to hold a convention of bards in<br/>
his own backyard.  With a concert of all Norrathian bards filling the halls<br/>
of Mistmoore Castle with lyric and verse, Mayong&#39;s only option will be to<br/>
personally end the concert himself.  Now, if only he could enlist the<br/>
assistance of the other Kelethin guild leaders...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
After reading everywhere about the raids into PoF, PoH, Kedge etc, I decided<br/>
it might be nice if we had a raid/server event in a different zone<br/>
accessible to lower level players.  I figured Mistmoore is a good choice<br/>
since the last couple of times I have been in it there weren&#39;t many people<br/>
in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, Mayong has never spawned on E&#39;ci.  The way I see it, there<br/>
are two possible explanations.  First, by design he isn&#39;t in the game and<br/>
will never spawn unless Verant includes him in a future patch.  Second, the<br/>
groups camping the castle haven&#39;t done what it takes and/or held the castle<br/>
long enough to get him to spawn.  Perhaps Mayong will spawn if his<br/>
placeholder is killed enough by a party holding the castle.  I am hoping the<br/>
second option holds true.  <br/>
<br/>
I petitioned and asked a guide if they could support a player run event like<br/>
this.  I had hoped that if the level of participation was high enough,<br/>
Verant would participate and spawn Mayong for us.  So far I have been<br/>
unsuccessful in getting official support lined up.  Still working on that<br/>
though.  <br/>
<br/>
The primary goal of this event is to successfully raid the castle and hold<br/>
it for an extended period of time.  In other words, once we start the raid<br/>
nobody has to zone out due to a train.  In order to meet this goal, here is<br/>
what I have in mind:<br/>
<br/>
Lake area:  Three groups in the low 20s to control the spawns in the lake<br/>
area and between the lake and graveyard.<br/>
Graveyard: Two groups.  One group in the mid 20s to control the graveyard.<br/>
One group in the low 20s to pull from the path between the lake and<br/>
graveyard.<br/>
Secret room behind crypt: One group in their low-mid 30s<br/>
Courtyard: Two groups in the mid-high 30s to control all the spawns in that<br/>
area plus the ramp leading up to the castle.<br/>
Castle:  At least four groups 40-50 to control the entire castle.  This<br/>
requirement is open to suggestion because I&#39;m not high enough level to know<br/>
what it takes to control the house.<br/>
Reserve:  One group (levels TBD) on standby to assist any group in need.<br/>
Healers:  A couple of clerics not in a group on standby to give EXP resses<br/>
to anyone who needs it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the kicker to keep it in line with the storyline: whenever possible,<br/>
each group has at least one bard in it.  Of course if your regular group of<br/>
six doesn&#39;t include a bard then you don&#39;t have to break up your group.  As<br/>
an alternative, there will be bards there not in a group to temporarily join<br/>
with a group after a combat to help them regen mana faster (assuming no<br/>
enchanter in the group).  Once mana regen is complete bard can disband and<br/>
6th person can rejoin.<br/>
<br/>
Proposed date: 15 January 2000, starting at 3PM CST.  Official time/date<br/>
confirmed once level of participation is known.  <br/>
<br/>
Known constraints: 1) Mistmoore is known to be a buggy zone so not really<br/>
certain how many people it can handle without causing lag problems.  2)  Too<br/>
many people may show up.  Will have to rely on cooperation of everyone<br/>
involved to ensure everyone has a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Feedback:  Request players with lots of experience fighting inside the<br/>
castle to send me advice on the number of groups required to safely hold the<br/>
castle.  Also request advice from players that have organized successful<br/>
raids on how to handle the coordination aspects of an event like this.  <br/>
<br/>
If you or your group is interested in participating, please send me a<br/>
private email to the following email address:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bamadude@...">bamadude@...</a><br/>

Thanks<br/>
