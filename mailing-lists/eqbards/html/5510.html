I have to ask if you EQ account name and passaword are the same with any<br/>
of your logins elsewhere?  It is possible that some hacked a user database<br/>
from the message board or something of that nature of which you are a part<br/>
of.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; First, thanks for the replies people have made, I hope to keep you<br/>
&gt; informed as and when I receive responses from Verant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In response to questions raised here, I shall try and pass on some<br/>
&gt; info that might help eliminate obvious explanations for the problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I live alone, no one has access to my computer, it is a standalone not<br/>
&gt; networked other than by modem, physically turned off when not in use,<br/>
&gt; no software of a dubious nature is loaded (as mentioned elsewhere<br/>
&gt; BackOrifice/Office etc) ... I am a computer auditor by profession<br/>
&gt; (security is in the blood, sadly!) and I have quite a bit of knowledge<br/>
&gt; of computer security/logs/exploits/whatever you might want to call it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I was sleepwalking and bizarrely did this.  Maybe an obscure<br/>
&gt; burglar broke in, left all my valuables and electricals, logged on,<br/>
&gt; guessed my password, sold all my virtual gear, and then logged out and<br/>
&gt; left my home untouched.  At least that&#39;s an entertaining thought ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll log in to EQ tonight again in the hope that a GM shows up at a<br/>
&gt; reasonable hour (or at least while I&#39;m still awake and functioning!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And until then, I&#39;ll keep singing and playing music to raise spirits,<br/>
&gt; just like a good bard should!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Would any of your friends/relatives have or can guess your station name and <br/>
&gt; &gt;password?  Do you have a spouse that is really upset with you spending too <br/>
&gt; &gt;much time on EQ?  Maybe he/she guessed your password and gave all your stuff <br/>
&gt; &gt;away.  Did you ever visit some everquest websites which you need to create <br/>
&gt; &gt;an account with user name and password?  Are either the user name or the <br/>
&gt; &gt;password same as your EQ login ones?  Have you ever sign any EQ class <br/>
&gt; &gt;petition with your station name?  Is your password easy to guess?  Did you <br/>
&gt; &gt;make the password the same as the surname of your character?  That is the <br/>
&gt; &gt;first thing a hacker would guess.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It seems like there can be only one reason.  Somehow, someone got hold of <br/>
&gt; &gt;your station name and password.  It is either thru you or thru Verant. :(<br/>
