&gt; Sorry if this is off topic, but I don&#39;t know a more knowledgeable group of<br/>
&gt; people so I though I&#39;d ask here.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a level 20 bard and am planning a trip to Cazic-Thule this weekend.  Can<br/>
&gt; anyone offer me any advice on what I should do or not do?  Things to avoid?<br/>
&gt; What should I expect?<br/>
&gt; Also, where is the closest place to get bound?  I&#39;d hate to have to make a<br/>
&gt; run from Freeport if I died.<br/>

The closest place to get bound to Cazic is Ogguk, but they&#39;re not really &quot;bard<br/>
friendly&quot; there, so you&#39;re looking at Freeport I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Cazic is a really fun and interesting place, but personally, I don&#39;t like it<br/>
much.  The reason for my dislike is the dynamics of the place.  The loot is very<br/>
good.  The experience is very good.  Trains WILL kill you though, and it&#39;s a<br/>
long run back to your body.  That&#39;s always the kicker to me, dying because of<br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
At your level, you should fight in the courtyard, with a good group.  You could<br/>
fight defenders (level 24) and warders (level 22) from the maze, which is to the<br/>
right of the courtyard.  You could also fight guards (level 17) and warriors<br/>
(level 15) in the courtyard itself.<br/>
<br/>
Just REALLY be careful.  If ANYONE says &quot;train&quot;, run like heck.  If you see more<br/>
than one alligator in the courtyard, don&#39;t think, &quot;Awww, he&#39;s so little, how<br/>
cute!&quot;, run.  The alligators of Cazic Thule are tiny, but they&#39;re all tougher<br/>
than Lockjaw, the grandpappy of Oasis, and they pack a mean mean bite.<br/>
