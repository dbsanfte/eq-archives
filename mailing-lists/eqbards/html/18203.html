<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631667401">i bet if they had this ability when dirge was implemented they would have<br/>
used it then instead of mana.  i really like the idea, except for the fact<br/>
that we would have to keep this song memmed all the time if we really wanted<br/>
to use it, since it will take 15 minutes to be able to sing it after it is<br/>
memmed, and i have enough trouble deciding which 8 songs to use.  i would<br/>
however be much more likely to have it as a often memmed song with a 15<br/>
minute timer rather than using 800 mana.<br/>

&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt; Bard&#39;s currently have 2 songs that use mana, DDD being one of them, <br/>
&gt; and it uses a *lot* of mana. We figure that there are probably a few <br/>
&gt; bards out there who can cast 2 of these, but not many. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since nothing that regens mana will help bards, and they only get <br/>
&gt; 1pt/tick back, it takes a LONG time for them to recover from singing <br/>
&gt; this song. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve recently acquired the ability to place a song-specific recast <br/>
&gt; time on the songs. We&#39;re considering replacing the mana requirement <br/>
&gt; on the song with a 15 minute re-sing time. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts?<br/>
