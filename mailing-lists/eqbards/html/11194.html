He said the screenshot showed wind instrument and greater lightstone when it <br/>
does not. You are stating the obvious as I said in the past I use it as my <br/>
wind instrument. I stated I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a lightsource because I&#39;ve <br/>
always had other lightsources equipped at one time or another, and frankly <br/>
could care less if a wind instrument IS a light source. Pointless post my <br/>
friend.<br/>

&gt;It works as both a wind instrument and a greater lightstone. The Crown<br/>
&gt;of the Frogluk Kings doesn&#39;t say &quot;Effect: Greater Lightstone&quot; either,<br/>
&gt;and yet when it is worn it&#39;s quite obvious that effect is on it as<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ve indicated. Checking whether it works as an instrument was simple.<br/>
&gt;Can it be equipped in melee #2? yes. Does playing Shari&#39;s Sonorous<br/>
&gt;Clouding with it equipped invis you? yep. There you go, works as a wind<br/>
&gt;instrument.<br/>
