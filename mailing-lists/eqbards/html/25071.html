<div id="ygrps-yiv-308624323">Mez&#39;s stack kind of funny.  They stack based on duration, shorter mez <br/>
overwriting longer mezs.  This is by design as they did not want <br/>
chanters to be able to cast a fast casting short mez then be able to <br/>
overwrite it with a longer mez.  The upshot of this is that our mez <br/>
(being shorter then the shortest chanter mez) will always overwrite <br/>
and block chanter mez&#39;s, regardless of level.  One of the points in <br/>
the class balance threads on whine play was to allow an exception to <br/>
the mez stacking rules, do that chanter mez would always overwrite <br/>
bard mez.  No word on if they are going to do this.<br/>

today on<br/>

mez. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; had a few bored chanters/confused when I start CC. Was grouped with <br/>
an old<br/>
&gt; guildie from sol ro yesterday when I had to mez 4 at a time while <br/>
they beat<br/>
&gt; the 5th down and she was quite &quot;wow bards can do that?&quot; and rest of <br/>
group<br/>
&gt; was somewhat like that too.  I told her, I&#39;m not a manasong bard...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Played Tani for most of the weekend, had a blast.  I&#39;ve spent most <br/>
of my<br/>
&gt; higher levels soloing or duoing, and this weekend, I ventured into <br/>
Sebilis.<br/>
&gt; Wow, what an education.  When we had a chanter, life was all fun... <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; slowed, messed and hasted.  I really didnt have to do any work but <br/>
when I<br/>
&gt; was the crowd control.. well, wow.. its really hard to mes things <br/>
and then<br/>
&gt; still fight the target mob.  I started to get the hang of it though <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; found outside views really help a lot.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My question is, what is up with the 53 mez and chanter mez?  I <br/>
found out the<br/>
&gt; hard way (i.e. group death spree) that they don&#39;t seem to stack!?!  <br/>
But my<br/>
&gt; 53 mez seemed to overwrite the 59 chanter mez???!!! Whats up with <br/>
that?  Am<br/>
&gt; I wrong here?  What am I missing?<br/>

&gt; P.S. Been a while, missed you all!  Has anyone quit eq that i shold <br/>
know<br/>
&gt; about? Seems like lots are lately =/<br/>
