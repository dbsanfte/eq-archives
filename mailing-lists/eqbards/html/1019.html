<div id="ygrps-yiv-88232800"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; OK, someone clear thnigs up for me. There is endless discussion about<br/>
&gt;&quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing two songs<br/>
&gt;at once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some sort of<br/>
&gt;special trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves starting<br/>
&gt;one song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song and<br/>
&gt;quickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and then<br/>
&gt;stopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing the<br/>
&gt;effect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of button<br/>
&gt;pressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have failed<br/>
&gt;entirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have the<br/>
&gt;icon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I hardly ever<br/>
&gt;actually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually higher<br/>
&gt;when I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any effect of<br/>
&gt;either song!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Until you get the rhythm down firmly, it is just like that.  When I first<br/>
saw a bard stacking songs (the bard Maachi, while fighting caimans in<br/>
Oasis), I couldn&#39;t believe it.  I asked how she could do that, and after she<br/>
wiped the caiman blood off her sword, explained how it worked.<br/>
<br/>
At first, I could not get it right.  I did it just like Maachi told me, but<br/>
it just didn&#39;t work.  But I knew that it had to, cause I&#39;d seen it work.<br/>
Finally, I got the timing down pat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over zealous but<br/>
&gt;very talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a lot of you<br/>
&gt;take seriously.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I take it very seriously.  I still stack songs, even at level 34, and<br/>
I&#39;ve seen bards more advanced in ability than I still stacking songs.<br/>
