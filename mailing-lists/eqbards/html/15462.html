&gt; If your group uses the /random 1 100 method of lottoing loot,<br/>

&gt; average value of the winning roll?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whoops, I meant median value (the value you need to roll to<br/>
have a 50% chance of winning the lotto).  The average roll is<br/>
skewed towards the low end due to there being more low numbers<br/>
than winning numbers for groups &gt; 2.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, here&#39;s the answer:<br/>
<br/>
The winning roll is the highest roll.  That means all the<br/>
other rolls must be lower than it (duh!).  If, say, the<br/>
winning roll were 87, that would mean all the other rolls<br/>
would have to be below 87.  Well, the chance of a roll being<br/>
86 or less is 86% (surprise! :).  So:<br/>
<br/>
N = number of people in the group <br/>
W = odds of a non-winning roll (as a fraction, i.e. 86/100 = 0.86)<br/>
W+1 = the winning roll<br/>
P = chance of winning<br/>
<br/>
Since W is just the chance of another roll being less than<br/>
yours, W^(N-1) is the chance of all other rolls in the group<br/>
being less than yours.  Since the median is the 50% win mark,<br/>
the median winning roll will be a 50% chance of all other<br/>
rolls being less than yours, or P = 0.5 (50%)<br/>
<br/>
P = 0.5 = W^(N-1) <br/>
<br/>
W = 0.5^[1/(N-1)], round up since we&#39;re really after W+1<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how it works out based on the number of people in your<br/>
group:<br/>
<br/>
N  Winning roll <br/>
2  51 <br/>
3  71 <br/>
4  80 <br/>
5  85 <br/>
6  88 <br/>
10 94 <br/>
20 97 <br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re in a group of 6 and the group gets a FBSS, and<br/>
you roll an 88, you have a 50/50 chance of winning the lotto.  <br/>
Likewise, for a group of 6, here are the odds of you winning<br/>
if you roll a certian number:<br/>
<br/>
Roll  Chance to win<br/>
2      0.0000001%<br/>
10     0.00059%<br/>
20     0.025%<br/>
30     0.21%<br/>
40     0.90%<br/>
50     2.82%<br/>
60     7.15%<br/>
70    15.64%<br/>
80    30.77%<br/>
85    41.82%<br/>
88    49.84%<br/>
90    55.84%<br/>
92    62.40%<br/>
95    73.39%<br/>
98    85.87%<br/>
100   95.10%<br/>
<br/>
Seems unfair that you need to roll an 88+ just to have a 50/50<br/>
chance to win, eh?  Well, take comfort in knowing that<br/>
everyone else in the group faces the same odds, and the chance<br/>
of one of you winning is 100%.  :)<br/>
