&gt; I think it&#39;s a compliment to the subscribers of this lists that there are<br/>
&gt; relatively few Bards.  WE all know how absolutely wonderful it is being a<br/>
&gt; bard.  But this class is so different from any of the other &quot;melee&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &quot;casting&quot; classes that I honestly believe that it takes a special individual<br/>
&gt; to play one and play it well (maybe I&#39;m just patting myself on the back, but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think so).  I think it is equally difficult to play an Enchanter *well*.<br/>
&gt; There are a lot of Enchanters that I group with that think they&#39;re watered<br/>
&gt; down Wizards with Mez and Charm.  They&#39;re not really playing the class<br/>
&gt; correctly, just as those Bards that think we&#39;re &quot;watered down Warriors with a<br/>
&gt; heal song that can run fast&quot;.<br/>

fight instead of being a primary damage/healing contributor.<br/>
Whether you prefer a bard or enchanter I&#39;ve found depends<br/>
mostly on how much tanking you want to be able to do, and how<br/>
much tolerance you have for mashing buttons over and over<br/>
during a fight.<br/>
<br/>
Overall I&#39;d give the enchanter the edge for battle management<br/>
at higher levels (Lullaby, Strike, and Chain seem to be<br/>
becoming less and less effective as I get higher in level).  <br/>
But bards are more flexible, being able to tank or heal or<br/>
buff depending on the party&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, a lot of folks play both classes &quot;wrong.&quot;  My L39<br/>
enchanter friend was griping about how many people she&#39;s<br/>
grouped with that have never seen an enchanter mesmerize and<br/>
are amazed when they first see it.<br/>
