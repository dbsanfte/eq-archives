<div id="ygrps-yiv-482201660">I deleted J.M e-mail about twisting.  He said you should be twisting and if<br/>
not then you are not playing the bard correctly.  It was designed that way.<br/>
Now I do not know about the song affecting the dmg but it seems that they<br/>
must have increase the MOB hit factor because I noticed the same thing these<br/>
past 4 days.  I am lvl 23 now but I was lvl 22 the whole last week.  I used<br/>
to kill gorge hound with ease from lvl 20 to 22 but somehow now they are<br/>
hitting me really hard at max dmg.  I have full bronze since lvl 18.  The<br/>
only thing that was changed in my armor since the past 4 days is that I got<br/>
a BS Mantle and a elf-hide glove.  My str is 95, my dex is 107, and my agi<br/>
is 108.<br/>

This actually would not surprise me if it&#39;s something Verant added recently,<br/>
since Twisting can somewhat be considered an exploit, even tho Verant has<br/>
not announced this, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see that they added the extra<br/>
damage to make up for the added bonuses of twisting.  This way they are<br/>
happy, and us the unknowing are not getting as much benefit as we thought.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t twist, I may switch up songs in battle if the needs<br/>
arise, but I have never found twisting to be that big a benefit.  At 17th<br/>
level the healing song only restores 7hp/tick while standing, and the<br/>
average monster is hitting for 20-50 pts per hit, so the heal isn&#39;t worth<br/>
it, when if I play anthem and it doesn&#39;t ever quit they get a more increased<br/>
attack rate, so therefore they do more damage.  <br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think twisting is worth it.  The closest I come is while<br/>
bellowing, as soon as I see the damage message, I stop and restart the song.<br/>
This decreases the times between bellows almost in half.  I actually felt<br/>
guilty about this at first, but without doing this, I would have problems<br/>
fighting some of the black/white creatures that I tend to solo.<br/>
<br/>
I know that most bards do twist, and I do not hold this against you in any<br/>
ways, but are you wanting me to believe that the game was designed to do<br/>
this?  I don&#39;t believe it was, I think the reasons the songs don&#39;t stop<br/>
immediately is so that if you get bashed or stunned, that you can restart<br/>
the song without losing the effect of whichever song you were playing.  <br/>
<br/>
This is just my 2cp.<br/>
