look around, otherwise you will:<br/>
<br/>
1) Take factions hits from monsters you are not fighting.<br/>
2) Piss off froggies who are borderline wanting to kill you.<br/>

Case in point last night.  Spec Tower, puller gets 4, decides<br/>
to zone, before he even makes it half way there all the specs<br/>
turn and head back toward me.  I thought it was just lag movement,<br/>
and that they were ghosts, and I waited for the client to update<br/>
because he pulled them almost out of my visual range, pretty far away.<br/>
It updated all right, 4 spectres B-lining for me.  I was on shore<br/>
no where near them or the tower, and all four, thats right - count<br/>
em - FOUR spectres attacked me.  The party stuck it out and our group<br/>
of four people took on the spectres.  But that is damn weird... WTF?<br/>
I was no where near the specs, the puller, yet I was manasonging the<br/>
others in the group.  Stupid Verant - no wonder we die all the time.<br/>
