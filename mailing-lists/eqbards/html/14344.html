&gt; I&#39;d love to hear the results!  But ooh the downtime!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was part of an all caster group of six that ventured into the new Paw.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; had 2 enchanters, a shaman, a cleric, a mage, and a wizard.  It was boring<br/>
&gt; kinda.  We either annihilated the mobs we faced or got forced to gate real<br/>
&gt; quick.  With 3 pets we were able to get away every time though.  If we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; have had 2 necros and just 1 enchanter and no mage I think it would have<br/>
&gt; been even easier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just curious as to why you didn&#39;t want a mage?  Necro pets were better<br/>
before the weapon delay adjustment, but now I think mages are just as good,<br/>
if not better.  Necros are very mana effecient, but can&#39;t unload on<br/>
something fast like a mage can.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of the all melee group, we went the other way.  We have 4 mages,<br/>
enchanter and a wizard, all gnomes on VZ around level 11-13.  With 5 pets<br/>
and blasting power from everyone, we take things down very fast.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think a necro&#39;s DOT would get halfway done before everything was dead.  With<br/>
plenty of summoned bandages, everyone has a good Bind Wound skill.<br/>
We can bandage up anyone to half health in 10 seconds or so.<br/>
