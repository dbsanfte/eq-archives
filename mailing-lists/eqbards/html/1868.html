Drives me nuts when a caster dumps his mana<br/>
into post battle healing, heals people up to full,<br/>
then sits to med.  Leaves me just sitting there,<br/>
with hymn almost useless.  Also, they had no<br/>
idea how to work with someone lulling.  I&#39;d equip<br/>
my lute, and just be typing &quot;wait &#39;til the second<br/>
from the left gets sparkly, then hit the one on the<br/>
right ....&quot; when they&#39;d just dive in against 4-6<br/>
bandits.  Of course, there I am with my lute in<br/>
hand, and 4 of the 6 bandits make a bee-line<br/>
for me.<br/>
