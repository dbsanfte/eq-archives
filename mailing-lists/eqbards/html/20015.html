<div id="ygrps-yiv-52804576">i&#39;ve heard a couple of horror stories about this place, but how<br/>
tough is it to get to the second floor with a party consisting of full party<br/>
52-55 or maybe even 2 parties. Time to equip some of robe wearing classes<br/>
with the ornate rune shield. Any tips/tricks/info would be greatly<br/>
appreciated. another question, does invis undead or invis work in this<br/>
place?<br/>
