<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008777969"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff class&gt;?<br/>
&gt; A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, Master of None.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was perusing a Shaman mail list and found out they think THEY are<br/>
&quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot;. I wounder how many other classes<br/>
have been to this? :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found in Mistmoore) which has no<br/>
&gt; discernible special effect.<br/>
&gt;  The Gypsy Lute (different from the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, in<br/>
&gt; that it is for a specific quest), which has no known special abilities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does not ones of these give +5 magic resistance? I know that&#39;s not much<br/>
of an &quot;ability&quot; but it is SOMETHING.<br/>
<br/>
What is there no rule #3? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have no rule #6<br/>
than no Rule #3? I heard there WAS a rule #3 in beta, but the took it<br/>
out because it made us overpowered. Is that true?<br/>
