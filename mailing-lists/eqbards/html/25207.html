<b>Subject:</b> Level 49 bard seeks equipment advice <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192297201">Hi all,<br/>
Well Im an old bard with limited playtime and terribly unlucky when it comes<br/>
to rolls *grin*. However I got lucky and got some &quot;Silver Chitin Hand Wraps&quot;<br/>
this weekend. The stats are:<br/>
+5 AC +3 vsMg +3 vsFire +3 vsCold +3 vsPos +3 vsDis effect: Haste (reported<br/>
broken)<br/>
Now I wonder what I should do? Should I try to sell them? (How much will<br/>
they be worth?) Should I keep it for the haste when/if it get fixed? If I<br/>
sell em should I sell them before or after they get fixed? I only have<br/>
around 1-2kpp in the bank so these hand wraps is a nice oppotunity for me to<br/>
get something upgraded..<br/>
Any advice will be appriciated..<br/>
