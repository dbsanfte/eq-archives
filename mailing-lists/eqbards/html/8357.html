&gt;Ok, this has got me really excited.  I am not sure how the Guise of the<br/>
&gt;Deciever works.  Could someone post about the Guise?  A Dark elf Bard.. wow<br/>
&gt;that is really tasty.  I am mainly wondering if the illusion accuratly<br/>
&gt;represents your current armor?  Any info would be appreciated.  I would<br/>
&gt;really like to freak people out by singing songs and wearing that cool <br/>
&gt;skull<br/>
&gt;helmet that the Dark Elves get to wear.<br/>

These things have become so passe on my server, but you can have some fun <br/>
with them. I think human-types and large races make the best use of the <br/>
illusion because of the smaller size and ultravision it gives you. For <br/>
anyone else it&#39;s just for show (pretty much - especially those that have <br/>
killed DE&#39;s).<br/>

I went to Neriak and killed some guards as a dark elf. The newbies had no <br/>
clue what was going on, and kept asking me why a dark elf would kill his own <br/>
guards.<br/>
