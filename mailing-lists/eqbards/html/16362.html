I think bloatware has more to do with really wasteful programming techniques<br/>
and design of algorithms, rather than purely limiting datatypes, which can<br/>
cause problems.. &quot;No, sir, my Visa didn&#39;t expire in 1902.&quot;  hehe.  By<br/>
limiting stats to 255.. they created a problem at high levels.. all classes<br/>
can only get so good (since this affects skill caps as well)... so<br/>
non-warrior melee classes will be half-ass versions of a warrior, with 2/3<br/>
the hit points.<br/>
<br/>
If I designed a game, I&#39;d use 32bit values for stats.  Yah, I&#39;ve got a STR<br/>
of 4,294,967,295!!  Woo!  :)<br/>

&gt; base 2 (binary) 8 bit word == 11111111<br/>
&gt; base 10 (decimal) == 255<br/>
&gt; base 16 (hex) == FF<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; so, stats are an 8-bit value, would be my guess<br/>
&gt; (space saving of this nature hasn&#39;t really been used in a LOOOOOOOONG<br/>
