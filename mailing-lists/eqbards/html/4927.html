&gt;nice, i will have to relay the info on the phoboplasms.  myself and another<br/>
&gt;bard have greaves.  we have yet to see the bracer and BP.  i got a helm<br/>
&gt;today (hehe wife at home playing) which is basically worthless unless in DE<br/>
&gt;form i guess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;our groups did know that the entire zone needs to be cleared before taking<br/>
&gt;on cazic, but damn good job getting him with his 3 goons around.  too bad he<br/>
&gt;dropped nothing, he usually has something good.<br/>

I am one happy bard tonight :)<br/>
Got my greaves and breastplate to go with everything else. Now all i need<br/>
is the arms and gloves and i got the visible set, course the other bard on<br/>
the server has the gloves and arms only....<br/>
We also killed more phobo&#39;s tonight and they dropped ANOTHER bracer on top<br/>
of the two from before. But they didnt drop any other bard armour. <br/>
