 </span></blockquote>I think this statement might be just a little short-sighted. Maybe <br/>
you meant to say &quot;I have never used concord once; it is useless to <br/>
me&quot; or &quot;I find concord to be a very limited song&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I think many songs may require &quot;non-standard&quot; situations before they <br/>
become of value. Let me tell you a tale of what happened this <br/>
weekend. My guild was preparing to raid the Char nobility, and while <br/>
people were on their way, some of us started hunting the zone out. <br/>
One one pull, our monk got &quot;zapped off the bridge&quot; by a caster, and <br/>
said he was stuck on a ledge. I decided to use another, often <br/>
worthless, song -- Solidarity of Vision. I targeted the monk, checked <br/>
out where he was located, moved to the other MOBs in the area to see <br/>
exact what the situarion was, directed our warrior as to what MOBs <br/>
needed pulling, waited for the others to leave, then went in and used <br/>
levitate to get the monk out. There may have been other ways to <br/>
handle the situation, but I found a pretty simple solution in <br/>
a &quot;worthless song&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I agree that this song is of very &quot;limited&quot; use, but I would <br/>
rather say I have thought of no good use for it instead of &quot;it is <br/>
useless&quot;.<br/>
