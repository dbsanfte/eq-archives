<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479639015">Shall we coordinate and make it a duet Galtin?  I was planning to move along<br/>
the same lines but without an invis potion.  I have good maps of Lower Guk<br/>
and there are ways in that we won&#39;t pass too many froggies.  When are you<br/>
and your cleric assistant planning this foray?<br/>

70% of my play time fooling around giving concerts (have like 23 pages of<br/>
songs so far and still growing from various aspects).  I forgot that that is<br/>
a lore item so this might actually work. If not, it will be an intereting<br/>
journey into guk.<br/>
