<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688847579">what i thought as well.  seems like guardian would be a completely useless<br/>
song if elemental did the same MR as well as FR and CR!  i am pretty sure<br/>
guardian does more MR than elemental, but won&#39;t know til i get home.<br/>

&gt; Hmmm, I will take a look at this tonight.  That is _not_ what <br/>
&gt; I recall.  I<br/>
&gt; thought (going from memory) that Guardian did like double the <br/>
&gt; magic resist<br/>
&gt; of elemental and that the ideal way would be to stack them - <br/>
&gt; one to boost mr<br/>
&gt; and the other to boost cold/fire.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sylly&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; 		Guardian Rhythms should only be used as a supplement to<br/>
&gt; 		Elemental Rhythms.  They both provide the same <br/>
&gt; magic resist,<br/>
&gt; 		and Elemental provides fire and cold resist as <br/>
&gt; well (most if<br/>
&gt; 		not all wizard spells are magic/fire/cold). </span></blockquote></div>
