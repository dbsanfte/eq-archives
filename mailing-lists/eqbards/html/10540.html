Subject: [eqbards] Dungeon advice<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do any of our great bards out there have some good ideas for dungeon<br/>
&gt; crawling for a 20th going on 21st level bard?  I&#39;ve been hunting a lot<br/>

After reading all the other people&#39;s comments on this topic, I would add<br/>
another - I belong to a guild and we have many members who are higher level<br/>
than I who are usually pretty willing to help the younger level members by<br/>
taking them into new places to show them around - they&#39;ve been there, they<br/>
know the pitfalls, etc. If you are a member, see if they will help you. If<br/>
you are not a member of a guild, see if you can find someone from a guild<br/>
that seems pretty nice, and see if they will help show you around - this has<br/>
been invaluable to myself and many others; it&#39;s certainly helpful to have<br/>
someone right there with you while you venture into a place like that. I am<br/>
only L21 myself, and have not ventured into those places just yet, with the<br/>
exception of Najena, where a higher level guildmate gave me a tour.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just another suggestion that might help.<br/>
