<div id="ygrps-yiv-850206220"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve heard  that this is a carry over from one of the<br/>
&gt;old &quot;merchant&quot; bugs that used to be in the game.  You <br/>
&gt;have to have your upper-most left inventory slot free.  <br/>
&gt;Several bards on the concert hall have reported this -<br/>
&gt;with that slot open you (should) get your stone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve never seen this problem.  I think these<br/>
solutions are more speculation than anything.  Verant in the<br/>
most recent patch stated that sometimes quests would not give<br/>
any reward and they have fixed this (supposedly).<br/>
<br/>
I would chalk it up to coding bugs, and not pick-your-favorite-slot<br/>
open in your inventory.  Again, I&#39;ve had every type of Lambent Gem<br/>
fall into a backpack slot after it was made 100% of the time.<br/>
