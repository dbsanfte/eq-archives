<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691132964">Yeah.  We just talk more than most people I think.  I see it with all my<br/>

answer in two to three words, even when they are feeling chatty.<br/>

a bard only thing.<br/>

I have seen it with my ranger, monk and cleric.<br/>

It seems to be across the board to me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On another note to a VERY long post, the but with the disapeparing text<br/>
&gt; buffer (which is one I want fixed!!) are you guys getting it a lot? I am<br/>
&gt; going to post it&#39;s own thread, but we are seeing it mostly with bards...<br/>
&gt; /sigh<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please know that I am not ignorning or blowing anyone&#39;s issues off. These<br/>
