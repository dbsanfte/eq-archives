<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013333771">I am curious to know!  There are other spots where this has happened as<br/>
well.  One in particular is a great short cut.  From NK cross the wooden<br/>
bridge and Zone into EK.  Then hop off the bridge and swim under it - swim<br/>
due West like you are going to swim between the legs of the bridge and you<br/>
fall beneath the world but ad moved to a safe spot:  you pop out at the base<br/>
of the High Hold ramp.<br/>

		Good thing they remembered to seal that cave off or you<br/>
would have run<br/>
		&#39;behind the world&#39; like I did in Butcherblock.  Eventually<br/>
you run out of<br/>
		terrain to stand on the back of and fall to the bottom of<br/>
the world.  The<br/>
		server will then relocate you to &#39;a safe point&#39;,<br/>
infortunately in<br/>
		Butcherblock &#39;a safe point&#39; is apparently several miles<br/>
above sea level.  I<br/>
		promptly fell for 32000 points of damage.  And no, at least<br/>
in EQ, you don&#39;t<br/>
		die before you hit the ground.  Interestingly it did take me<br/>
several seconds<br/>
		to hit the ground, too bad I don&#39;t have levitate yet.<br/>
<br/>
		On a side note it was cool to see &#39;behind the sets&#39; so to<br/>
speak.  Made me<br/>
		feel like I was in an old Hollywood western in some<br/>
storefront ghost town.<br/>
		If anyone is curious and wants to see this send me a reply<br/>
and I&#39;ll tell you<br/>
		how to get there.<br/>
