&gt; I guess we should forward all of our issues directly to Baelish<br/>
&gt; from here on<br/>
&gt; out.  Still nothing on Lullaby though.<br/>

Hmm, let me make sure I understand this. The effect on the boots and gloves<br/>
is so powerful that they made the AC lower.<br/>
<br/>
1) When these items started dropping they had the same AC and no effect at<br/>
all.<br/>
2) How is Enduring Breath and Summon Drink better so much better than Fury,<br/>
Snare, Cancel Magic (just some of the effects I&#39;ve seen on other class<br/>
specific items) that is requires a lower AC than Rangers who can&#39;t even wear<br/>
plate?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
At least if we accidentally summon way too much water, we have enduring<br/>
breath so we won&#39;t drown.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to look on the bright side,<br/>
