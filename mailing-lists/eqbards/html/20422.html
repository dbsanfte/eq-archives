<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] My recent death toll for Rakka/Minkin... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-487582863">Hmmm... how the hell indeed.. whats amazing is that i kept it... had 3 Fear<br/>
deaths (2 with unressable naked corpses from being bound in a BAD spot)...<br/>
then there were the two needless deaths in Kaesora getting the fang.... then<br/>
there was the backspawn in Charasis... oh yeah, and then there was the<br/>
&quot;usually safe&quot; gate to Skyfire where we were met and dispelled by two<br/>
chromos....<br/>
<br/>
so... its been a rough level :)<br/>
