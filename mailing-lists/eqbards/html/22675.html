<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011406285">it seems 20 is sung, 45 is max with instrument.  and no hymn does not stack<br/>
with cantana.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; If a 50 point slap hits a 45 point shield then 5 points would bleed<br/>
&gt; through. The up side it seems is that 45 max is for sung, some people<br/>
&gt; are getting upwards of 95 rune per 3 second pulse (with <br/>
&gt; K-lute). What I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t understand is why people think it&#39;s crap. *boggle* It doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stack with Niv&#39;s, is this really such a problem? It&#39;s all defense,<br/>
&gt; Niv&#39;s is balance, there&#39;s a time and place for all things. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thinking about Cantata strategies (not that I&#39;ll break 51 <br/>
&gt; much less get<br/>
&gt; that high), does Hymn stack with Cantata? If so then Cantata + Hymn +<br/>
&gt; Shielding sounds like a damn fine backup healer position. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;m just playing my bard wrong *shrug*<br/>
