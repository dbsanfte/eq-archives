<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008974761">Another method of earning some cash, go to Innothule swamp, hang out near<br/>
the entrance to Guk.  You will find all kinds of netted armor, at least we<br/>
did about a month ago, if you are high enough level, 12-13 go into the<br/>
entrance to Guk, inside you will find netted and woven armor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Netted armor=1pp per piece<br/>
Woven armor=3-4 per piece<br/>
Woven gloves (rare but they are there) 6-10 pp, depends on the market, but<br/>
most monks will want this as it allows them to hit magical creatures.<br/>
<br/>
A party of 6, dividing up the loot at the end of the day made 50 pp each in<br/>
about 5 days.<br/>
