<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143988468">Another thing I should mention is that another friend and I tried to<br/>
duplicate this in release when we got lullaby and it had already been<br/>
toned down considerably by then. At the time I figured someone at Verant<br/>
had seen the shot on EQVault and made some changes between the end of<br/>
beta and release. As we were L15 about 2 weeks after release that would<br/>
be the only explanation I could think of for why it already didn&#39;t work<br/>
as it had in beta.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting thing I&#39;d forgotten was that until the second last<br/>
day of beta 4, only the first 20 bard songs were on vendors in the game.<br/>
So I don&#39;t think any song over L20 got tested very much before release.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I do remember reading stories of bards in Blackburrow mezzing 30+ mobs at a <br/>
&gt; &gt; time, which probably prompted the nerf. However, now I believe you can only <br/>
&gt; &gt; affect at most 4 mobs, so that kind of solves that worry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was actually 2 bards that did that. With lutes. The resists when one<br/>
&gt; bard tried it were too much. Also, remember that this was at the top of<br/>
&gt; blackburrow, and 90% of the crowd of gnolls mezzed at the time were<br/>
&gt; green to the 2 bards, and they still woke up occasionally and took a<br/>
&gt; poke at the bards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wish I could find my old screenshot of it, it was 2 friends of mine I<br/>
&gt; played with on Fennin Ro back in Beta 4, and it made screenshot of the<br/>
&gt; day just after beta closed.<br/>
