<div id="ygrps-yiv-651780048">While I too would love to be able to have 2 Demon Claws because I think it<br/>
would look cool, I am becoming more and more convinced that weapons of<br/>
varrying speeds make little difference when combatting spellcasters.<br/>
<br/>
/RANT<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been hanging out in Cazic Thule for a few weeks, and we get our fair<br/>
share of casters there. It amazes me, day after day, how a low level mob (to<br/>
us) can sustain over 100 points of damage in a split second, and STILL get<br/>
their spells off 90% of the time, while a bard is bashed for a single point<br/>
of damage and their song ends, or a spellcaster is smacked for as single<br/>
point of damage and their spell is interrupted. Is this something Verant did<br/>
to &quot;give the monsters a chance&quot;? Kinda like how a low level mob can smack<br/>
you for 55 points of damage with a single swing, while we bards probably<br/>
will never be able to dish out that type of damage, even when our levels<br/>
approach the 40&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
And does anyone know how &quot;stunning&quot; works? It seems like whenever I am hit,<br/>
I am auto-stunned half the time, whether it was for 50 points, or 1 point of<br/>
damage I receive. Does it have anything to do with my armor? With my Stamina<br/>
or Strength scores? Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
/RANT OFF<br/>

Sorry for the rant, it&#39;s the only thing I can think of to complain about!<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Another example, I can&#39;t wield 2 dragoon dirks.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&lt;sarcasm&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;m sorry you have to operate at 98% potential effectiveness<br/>
&gt;&gt;using a different weapon in your second hand instead of<br/>
&gt;&gt;another dirk.  Just think - if you were wielding two dirks and<br/>
&gt;&gt;found another better weapon, you&#39;d have to operate at 98%<br/>
&gt;&gt;effectiveness until you could get another of that new weapon.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Why doesn&#39;t Verant just make the mobs drop two of each weapon<br/>
&gt;&gt;at a time?  Oh the horror.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The game is perfectly playable using a different weapon in<br/>
&gt;&gt;your off hand.  What you are complaining about is a &quot;want,&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;not a &quot;need.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What&#39;s the big deal with people wanting 2 of the same item?<br/>
&gt;Just from a game mechanics point of view, 2 items with differing<br/>
&gt;delays are better.  They get out of synch, and allow shorter<br/>
&gt;windows for casters to get a spell off.  Plus, I LIKE the way<br/>
&gt;different weapon combo&#39;s look. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
