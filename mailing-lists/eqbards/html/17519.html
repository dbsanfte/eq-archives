    Part of the problem is we can&#39;t &quot;See&quot; the damage or DOT songs are<br/>
doing. Last night I kept having to tell my party &quot;I got that one !&quot; when<br/>
it &quot;Died&quot; from my drum combo (FCC and COF) just trying to let them know<br/>
I wasn&#39;t being a slackard :(   ...felt like a fool but kept telling<br/>
myself if Moon doesn&#39;t promote herself then no one else will... and<br/>
since there was a 43rd enchanter who 3 times I had to explain that I WAS<br/>
playing clarity, it just didn&#39;t have a symbol, he had to &quot;look at the<br/>
&#39;head clears&#39; message&quot; I knew these folks wouldn&#39;t appreciate the more<br/>
subtle stuff a Bard does. <br/>
    Sure be nice if we could get Verant to report the DAM we are doing<br/>
with our songs.</div>
