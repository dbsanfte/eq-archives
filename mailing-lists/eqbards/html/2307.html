<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131801518">I have found the /follow command to be a lifesaver for travelling in groups<br/>
with selo&#39;s.  the only time you could not use it is in areas that are not<br/>
wide-open or dangerous, like lavastorm, where you would not use it anyway.<br/>
as far as long distance travels tho, auto-follow is awesome.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is the bard song too dangerous?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t make the original statement, but I&#39;ll tell you why <br/>
&gt; *I* think it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; too dangerous.  The bard song only affects party members <br/>
&gt; within a certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; range of the bard.   We&#39;ve all experienced the case where a <br/>
&gt; party member<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets out of range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando and then falls <br/>
&gt; behind the party.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Imagine the same thing happening 100 feet underwater.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again though, like most of the discussion on my post, this <br/>
&gt; misses what I<br/>
&gt; thought was my main point, which is that a bard song wearing <br/>
&gt; off should<br/>
&gt; not nullify an already in effect spell. That is what makes the bard<br/>
&gt; song especially dangerous. You can&#39;t even use it for yourself when<br/>
&gt; grouped or to help one person who the spell effect has worn off from,<br/>
&gt; without risking negatively effecting other party members who happen to<br/>
&gt; be in range. What makes it doubly dangerous is that the spell icon is<br/>
&gt; still in place on their screen, so they may not notice that <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve lost<br/>
&gt; the effect until it&#39;s too late.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your points however are equally valid. It&#39;s enough problem keeping a<br/>
&gt; party together with Selo&#39;s, given that people theoretically run all at<br/>
&gt; the same speed in this game, with the huge variation in swimming speed<br/>
&gt; depending on skill it wouldnt be much use as the party&#39;s main resource<br/>
&gt; for an underwater trip. But the cancellation effect makes it less than<br/>
&gt; useful as a back up resource as well.<br/>
