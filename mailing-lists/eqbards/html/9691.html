<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470322162">Level 21: Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Short distance random teleport<br/>
Skill: Wind<br/>
Location: HighHold Pass<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Analysis: Every 6 seconds that this song is played everyone in your party <br/>
will be randomly teleported a short distance. Apparently does not teleport <br/>
you through walls or locked doors. In a dungeon, this song can get you in a <br/>
whole lot of trouble. Outdoors, however, with a flute in hand, it has an <br/>
amazing range. From the front gate of Qeynos one pulse can jump you to the <br/>
zone line or 2 feet away. Lots of fun, you do a silly dance while playing <br/>
it. This song is very useful to get characters unstuck from a <br/>
wall/crack/floor/etc... when a GM is not around. In a situation where the <br/>
entire party is trying to flee a monster or group of monsters, <br/>
theoretically, this song can help, but it is very risky, as the entire party <br/>
will be separated and will be on their own to make it to the zone border. <br/>
Use with caution.<br/>
<br/>
Level 22: Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Cancel Magic<br/>
Skill: String (Required)<br/>
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: This song is supposed to get rid of all DoT and de-buffs that have <br/>
been cast upon a party, but leave all of your buffs intact. A few people <br/>
have reported that it has worked for them but many bards report no effect at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Level 23: Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain<br/>
Effects: TARGET, Snare -Attack Speed<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: HighHold Pass<br/>
Upgrades: Reports from high (45+) level bards that song will stop movement <br/>
at half HP.<br/>
Analysis: This song will allow you to snare runners, a very useful thing, <br/>
and also slows attack speed of target.  One big advantage of this song is <br/>
that it can be &#39;cast&#39; while moving, unlike casters that must standstill to <br/>
cast their snare/root spell.  This can be a life saver in dungeons.  This <br/>
song will break root/snare from casters so be careful using in a party, <br/>
unless you are the designated snarer.  This song can also be used to break <br/>
root indoors on yourself, you will move slowly which is better then not at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Level 24: Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Ultravision See invisible<br/>
Skill: Wind<br/>
Location: Erudin<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Note: Not weavable with Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding.<br/>
Analysis: Allows you to see invisible, as well as give you ultravision <br/>
(useful for blind humans). This song also tends to give everything a bluish <br/>
hue.<br/>
<br/>
Level 25: Psalm of Warmth<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Infravision +Cold rest Fire-based damage shield +AC<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Erudin, Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Damage shield at every 5 levels after 26 (ie 6 dam at 31, 7 dam at <br/>
36). Cold rest every other level?<br/>
Analysis: Increases resistance to cold-based spells, gives a small AC boast, <br/>
Infravsion, and most importantly will give a party-wide fire based damage <br/>
shield (starts at 5 damage).  This damage shield will stack with all <br/>
non-cold based damage shields.<br/>
<br/>
Level 26: Angstlich&#39;s Apalling Screech<br/>
Effects: NON-PARTY, AE Fear<br/>
Skill: Brass<br/>
Location: Kelethin<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: This song is great for when you need to run when a battle has gone <br/>
bad, it is also useful to give the casters time to get off an Evac/gate as <br/>
well.  Another use for this song is while soloing/grouping outdoors.  Fear <br/>
the target then Chain it and enjoy wacking on its back while it runs from <br/>
the scary bard. If you group with a Rogue they will love you, backstabs <br/>
galore.<br/>
<br/>
Level 27: Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens<br/>
Effects: TARGET, Charm<br/>
Skill: Wind<br/>
Location: Kelethin<br/>
Upgrades: None, charm is limited to mobs 37th lvl and under.<br/>
Analysis: Will charm a monster for ~ 15 seconds. During that time, the <br/>
monster will respond to /pet commands. Allows you to do things like charm <br/>
D&#39;Vinn and tell him to attack Crush. Be careful though, because when the <br/>
charm wears off, the monster will frenzy on you.  PC/NPC pets are immune to <br/>
charm as long as the owner is alive.  This is another song that requires a <br/>
full hot key bank to use effectively. Hot key this sing and the following <br/>
pet commands (using socials) /pet attack, /pet back off, /pet who is leader, <br/>
/pet sit down, /pet follow.  Sometimes a mob will agro on a party member use <br/>
/pet back off to fix this.  This song takes a lot of practice to get right, <br/>
but once you do the results are worth it.  Interesting use for this song is <br/>
to stop kill stealing spell casters. If you spot a wizard trying to steal <br/>
your kill, just charm the monster. In the 10 or so seconds that the monsters <br/>
is charmed, the wizard will have dumped about all of his mana, casting <br/>
spells on the now spell-proof monster. When charm wears off, kill the <br/>
monster and retain the looting rights while the caster looks on in confusion <br/>
and frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Level 28: Crission&#39;s Pixie Chase<br/>
Effects: TARGET, Mesmerize/Stun<br/>
Skill: Wind<br/>
Location: Kelethin<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Analysis: This is a single target Mesmerize song. If you have good targeting <br/>
you can mez up to 3 targets at a time(this can be very hard to do). Any <br/>
attack against the mob will wake it up, so besure to inform your party when <br/>
you do this.  This song is also useful for intrupting NPC spell casters, for <br/>
PC casters Bellow is a better choice (harder to resist).<br/>
<br/>
Level 29: Psalm of Vitality<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +AC +Poison resist<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every other level?<br/>
Unconfirmed Analysis: Increase resistance to poison and gives a small AC <br/>
increase. Does not provide a damage shield like Psalm of Warmth.<br/>
<br/>
Level 30: Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant<br/>
Effects: Target, -Magic Resistance Dot<br/>
Skill: Percussion<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every other level?<br/>
Note: Stacks with all other DOT songs.<br/>
Analysis: This song has a small dot effect and lowers magic resistance.  The <br/>
MR debuff will stack with Encahnter/Shamen MR debuffs.<br/>
<br/>
Level 31: Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Levitation<br/>
Skill: Wind<br/>
Location: HighHold<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Analysis: The range on this song is short, so it is not too useful in party <br/>
situations unfortunatly.  This can be a dangerous song to use in dungeon <br/>
settings, as it will allow all mobs in dungeon rooms above and below you to <br/>
attack. Since these mobs will be attacking through walls, ceilings, and <br/>
floors, you will not be able to fight back. If this happens to you, <br/>
immediately stop playing the song. Once you stop levitating, the mobs will <br/>
no longer be able to attack you through. Zone immediately, as the mobs what <br/>
were attacking you, will now be racing through the dungeon to find and kill <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Level 32: Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Mana Regeneration<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: This is the Holy Grail song of any party with mana users. There <br/>
have been mixed reports on the weavability of this song, as it gives no on <br/>
screen icon.  The song will stack with Enchanter Clarity for a further <br/>
increase to mana regen and will stack with itself.<br/>
<br/>
Level 33: Psalm of Cooling<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Ultravision +Fire Resist +AC Cold-based damgage shield<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Any<br/>
Upgrades: Damage shield does same damage as Psalm of Warmth.<br/>
Analysis: The damage shield will NOT stack with non-cold based damage <br/>
shield. It will actually subtract from them, so a magician shield that did <br/>
13 damage will only do 7 when stacked with this song.<br/>
<br/>
Level 34: Lyssa&#39;s Solidarity of Vision<br/>
Effects: TARGET, Bind sight<br/>
Skill: Wind<br/>
Location: Erudin<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Analysis: This song allows you to see though the eyes of the target. This <br/>
can be a PC or NPC. You can &#39;chain&#39; this by targeting something you see from <br/>
the current target and restarting the song.  This song has a zone wide <br/>
range.<br/>
<br/>
Level 35: Denon&#39;s Dissension<br/>
Effects: TARGET, AE Drain Mana<br/>
Skill: Brass<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: The mana drain rate is very slow and as many mobs seem to have <br/>
unlimited mana not of great use.<br/>
<br/>
Level 36: Vilia&#39;s Verses of Celerity<br/>
Effects: PARTY: +AGI +Attack speed<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every level?<br/>
Note: Does not stack with Anthem de Arms, does stack with Chant of Battle<br/>
Analysis: Stacks nicely with Chant of Battle, to increase DEX, STR, and AGI <br/>
and increase the parties attack speed. The attack speed component does not <br/>
stack with Enchanter/Shamen attack speed spell lines.<br/>
<br/>
Level 37: Psalm of Purity<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +Disease Resist +AC<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every other level?<br/>
Analysis: Does not provide a damage shield<br/>
<br/>
Level 38: Tuyen&#39;s Chant of Flame<br/>
Effects: Target, -Fire Resist DoT<br/>
Skill: Percussion Instruments<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every level?<br/>
Note: Stacks with all other DOT songs.<br/>
Analysis: It does 36 damage total over three ticks (the song&#39;s duration) and <br/>
drops<br/>
Fire Resistance 14 points (at 48th level), if you use a drum. Without a <br/>
drum,<br/>
it does 24 damage total, and still lowers Fire Resistance by 14.<br/>

Level 40: Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aria<br/>
Effects: Target, Cancel magic<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Kelethin<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: Removes one buff per pulse.<br/>
<br/>
Level 41: Psalm of Mystic Shielding<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +Magic Resistance<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Qeynos, Kelethin<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Unconfirmed Analysis: Increases magic resistance by 50<br/>
<br/>
Level 42: McVaxius Beserker Cresendo<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +STR +Attack Speed<br/>
Skill: Brass<br/>
Location: Freeport<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Unconfirmed Analysis: The attack speed increase is better than Celerity. <br/>
Does not stack with Chant of Battle, Anthem de Arms or Vilia&#39;s Verses of <br/>
Celerity.<br/>
<br/>
Level 43: Denon&#39;s Desparate Dirge<br/>
Effects: NON-PARTY, AE DD<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Notes: Only mana using sing, requires 800 mana. Currently Bard mana is <br/>
Intelligence based.<br/>
Analysis: This song does a one-time damage of 400 points to each monster <br/>
within its radius. That&#39;s up to 1600 points of damage to 4 monsters. Due to <br/>
it&#39;s power, Verant restricted its usage, making it the only Bard song to <br/>
require mana. One use of this song is engineered to drain most, if not all <br/>
of a Bard&#39;s mana. Supposedly it will take 30 minutes of sitting down or <br/>
about an hour of doing normal actions before the Bard&#39;s mana level will have <br/>
recovered enough to use this song. Mana regeneration spells, songs, or items <br/>
have no effect on a Bard&#39;s mana regeneration rate. The mana drain has been <br/>
engineered such that no matter what buffs are cast or no matter what INT <br/>
enhancing items you have, there will be no way to sing this song 2 times, <br/>
back to back. This song is currently bugged as singing it will do 400points <br/>
to the Bard himself.<br/>
<br/>
Level 44: Cassindra&#39;s Elegy<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +WIS +INT<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Erudin<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: at 48th level, this song will raise Wisdom and Intelligence by 13.<br/>

Skill: Percussion<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Notes: Stacks with other DoT songs.<br/>
Analysis: It does 36 damage total over three ticks (the song&#39;s duration) and <br/>
drops Cold Resistance 14 points (at 48th level), if you use a drum. Without <br/>
a drum, it does 24 damage total, and still lowers Cold Resistance by 14.<br/>

Effects: NON-PARTY, AE -Attack speed DoT<br/>
Skill: Stringed<br/>
Location: High Hold<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: Does 40 damage per tick. This song is a combination of the level <br/>
20 Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding and Chords of Dissonance, on steroids.<br/>
