<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077188693">Heh I get accused of twinking my bard.  I have several bronze, FS spear,<br/>
blood-stained mantle, 2 oppaline earrings and two jagged bands.  The<br/>
irony is I came to Veeshan so I couldn&#39;t twink, Elfson (17) is my<br/>
highest character (I have a 16 cleric also).  People have been genorous<br/>
and gave me my FS spear (at lvl 3, that ruled!) and the bronze breast<br/>
plate (actually the nice wood elf bard who gave it to me gave me a small<br/>
one, bu t I was soon able to trade it for a medium).  Othen than that I<br/>
have bought it all myself.  I don think people realize with the aging of<br/>
servers, how amazing cheap low level items have become.  I make platinum<br/>
(for buying items which cost 20ish P) easily enough killing oasis orcs<br/>
and dervishes (I usually buy all the bronze that drops for about half<br/>
the high price I get for it due to my high CHA, and the group is<br/>
perfectly happy to let me have it).  Actually Elfson has partially<br/>
twinked my cleric by getting a good deal on a foreman&#39;s tunic (100p) and<br/>
buying it for him...  Then again people see him (in mostly leather) and<br/>
don&#39;t think twice.  But with the foreman&#39;s tunic, Shiny shield,<br/>
Bullsmasher, thich leather apron I think he has better equipment right<br/>
now...<br/>

&gt; I started up my bard on E&#39;ci back in April.  I competed against 40-50<br/>
&gt; newbies in the newbie areas for bats, wasps, etc.  I stayed in GFAY and<br/>
&gt; Crushbone until I was 10th level.  By the time I had made 10th level, I had<br/>
&gt; less than 5 PP in the bank.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other day I started up a newbie gnome mage.  I decided to do the bard<br/>
&gt; mail quests a few times to get some gold and EXP.  Also decided to stay in<br/>
&gt; GFAY and level up in the newbie area there.  This time there were maybe 4-5<br/>
&gt; other people in the area.  I asked a cleric if he coud bind me in Kelethin.<br/>
&gt; He gladly did so without charging me.  He also voluntarily buffed me with a<br/>
&gt; Bravery and Guard.  With the extra HPs and AC, I started killing bats like<br/>
&gt; crazy.  I didn&#39;t even worry about sitting down to med and heal.  Soon<br/>
&gt; someone auctioned they wanted to buy bat wings.  I told them I had 20 and<br/>
&gt; initiated the trade without even discussing price.  The person gave me 10PP<br/>
&gt; for them.  Last night I looted a few pixie dust.  Paladin auctioned he<br/>
&gt; wanted to buy some.  Once again offered them to him without discussing<br/>
&gt; price.  Once again I got 10PP.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now I&#39;ve gotten 20PP for a 4th level character that took my bard at least<br/>
&gt; 15 levels to acquire.  With the HP buffs, I haven&#39;t even died since 1st<br/>
&gt; level.  I bought all my 4th level spells and still had plenty of money left<br/>
&gt; over.  I then bought as much cloth armor as I could find.  Funny thing is<br/>
&gt; next time I went out to the newbie area I got accused of twinking:-)<br/>
