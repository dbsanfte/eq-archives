&gt; INVULNERABLE!&quot;  Ack!  what is that?  Well, you need magical weapons to hit<br/>
&gt; certain monsters and &quot;combine&quot; weaps are ones you can purchase.  A combine<br/>
&gt; dagger goes for about 33pp, long sword and scimitars about 62pp.  They are<br/>
&gt; sold at the gypsy camps in North Karana, Lavastorm and Rathe Mountains.<br/>

&gt; furthest one to get to.  Lavastorm has lots of fire elementals that can<br/>
&gt; attack and they are nasty.  North Karana has griffins and lions and such<br/>
&gt; that come right thru the gypsy camp.  Rathe Mts has far fewer monsters so<br/>
&gt; very close to the camp but it woould be quite a trek to get there.<br/>

gypsy camp there.  (I should have gotten a scimitar or rapier but what did I<br/>
know about weapon delays and damage ratios, the sword looked cool WAY back<br/>
then...).<br/>
