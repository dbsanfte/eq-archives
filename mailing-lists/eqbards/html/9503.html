<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530439246">I did the quest.  Carrillion took my faction high enough for it to work.  I<br/>
was indifferent to start and he wouldn&#39;t give it to me.  After playing the<br/>
song he changed his tune though.  I don&#39;t think you need to do the first<br/>
part of the quest, but I did it anyway just to be sure.  Not like its very<br/>
hard, I was able to get off the boat, kill the cat, and get back on the boat<br/>
before it departed.<br/>

I recently acquired a nice set of Mino Hero shackles, and I was<br/>
wondering if anyone here has done the Hero Bracers quest.  I ask because<br/>
the descriptions of this quest on several web pages say it is for Human<br/>
Steel Warriors only.  But I have never found a quest that couldn&#39;t be<br/>
done with suitable faction adjustments (via Carrillion).  Luckily, I am<br/>
a half elf (one of the races allowed to use the bracer according to the<br/>
item description).  Also, can you do it without doing the first part of<br/>
the quest?  Or is that required as is implied by the quest descriptions?<br/>
