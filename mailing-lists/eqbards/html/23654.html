<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Damage shields? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-584578130">Heh...I&#39;ve been watching the coversation, and I think I&#39;ll finally take a shot at it.<br/>
<br/>
Our damage shields aren&#39;t the best, but they&#39;re not that bad.  With the addition of good resists, and AC to the shields, they&#39;re good songs.  I normally group with a cleric, shaman, and chanter...I&#39;m usually the only tank in the group, but sometimes we have a ranger to die, I mean fight, beside me :)<br/>
<br/>
So, most&#39;ve the songs I woulda played (chains, hastes, etc) are outclassed by the others in the group.  With only 1 tank with me, putting away my weapons and adding in a small amount of haste (Ervaj) doesn&#39;t help us (and the Chants are mostly ruled out because we&#39;re fighting in Velious...too much CR there).  So normally I&#39;ll twist Niv&#39;s (or Hymn), Chant of Battle (Str/Dex/AC...me and the ranger are dex monsters), and a Psalm.  The choice of the Psalm is based on where we hunt (whether we need FR or CR).  Also, if our mage is around, we stack dmg sheilds, we can easily and quickly get 43 pts in the dmg shields (9 from psalm, 9 from SS bracer, then lava shield).  Ok...this isn&#39;t the best selection of songs...but, it&#39;s the selection that I have found stacks with almost all the buffs my group members use.<br/>
<br/>
On stats...with a Shaman in the group, we&#39;re stat buffed out the wazoo, and with CoB, we have Str and Dex near to 200 each, so I don&#39;t think adding too much to that will help (though I may be wrong : ).<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s a better selection?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  I just don&#39;t see how our damage shield songs could possible help<br/>
them do their job better than extra strength or extra haste or extra dex<br/>
(for crits) etc. etc.  I just have not heard any convincing arguments for<br/>
why our damage songs would ever be the best choice for an additional song to<br/>
mix in.  Except from a few human monks who desperately wish to be able to<br/>
see in the dark.<br/>
