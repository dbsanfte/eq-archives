<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412856402">Ok, so maybe I was a little cranky and unreasonable.  It happens sometimes.<br/>
But yesterday morning, I moved Tani to Cazic Thule, hoping to relive some of<br/>
the excitement of my early days.   &quot;26 Bard lookin&quot; got me a group with 3<br/>
Shadowknights.  Pretty damn good group actually for lizzies... lots of tank<br/>
power, i just sat back and used instruments and healed and damage shielded<br/>
and we didn&#39;t need much med time.  Until we pulled more than two...<br/>
 <br/>
We had 4 lizzies, protector, sent, 2 defenders... the puller calls<br/>
protector, I &quot;assume&quot; we&#39;re all assisting, and next thing I know I&#39;m being<br/>
beat on by the protector and am at 2 bubs of health.  I say &quot;Run?&quot; .. they<br/>
say &quot;No&quot;... so i hang in there another bubble.  At that point, I say, &quot;i&#39;m<br/>
outa here&quot; and head to the zone, only to get whacked right before the line.<br/>
Happens all the time, but the interesting thing is what happened next.<br/>
 <br/>
Me: &quot;So um, you know that taunt button?&quot;<br/>
Puller: &quot;If I taunt, they will hit me&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Um, you&#39;re kinda a tank&quot;<br/>
Other SK: &quot;But with that many lizzies, we&#39;ll die if we taunt&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Um, I died.&quot;<br/>
Third SK: &quot;Oh, I thought you zoned&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Did you all zone&quot;<br/>
PUller: &quot;yeah, we made it&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Yes, I would be that smushed blue corpse you ran OVER on your way to<br/>
the zone&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
All of a sudden my party disbanded...<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I get back to the zone, pretty irate by now... and ask WTF happened.  They<br/>
said &quot;Well, you just don&#39;t know how to play with Shadowknights.&quot;  I<br/>
mentioned that regardless of anything, its in really poor form to ungroup<br/>
someone on a corpse run.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I dont&#39; know that I told that story well.  But i guess after reading<br/>
the &quot;bad mage&quot; thread, just wanted to point out that its never a bad class,<br/>
its almost always bad players.  <br/>
