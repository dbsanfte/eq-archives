<div id="ygrps-yiv-835906880">I had a hard time finding the named Centaur at first, too.  He&#39;s in the<br/>
building that&#39;s most West.  He&#39;s around the back of the pole, so you have to<br/>
go all the way in.  He stands about 15 feet tall, or so it seems to my half<br/>
elf, a bit taller than the other Centaurs.<br/>
<br/>
I played in Paw for about a week and made near 100 plat.  This was fighting<br/>
Nobles, Commanders, Shaman, and Rexx or Lenrel, almost exclusively.  The<br/>
SnakeSkin mask and gloves are very good sellers at 5 pp, and the Tunic will<br/>
go for 7 pp if you&#39;re willing to wait for a Druid to realize he or she needs<br/>
it.  :P  I have only been able to get about 20 pp for the RTS&#39;, and those<br/>
spawned VERY slow.  I managed to find 2 in the week I was there.   It&#39;s a<br/>
very fun dungeon, I wish I had gone over before level 14 so I could enjoy<br/>
some of the other spawn spots, than just Rexx&#39;s area or Lenrel&#39;s.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Finally got to Paw last night...on Cazic its a bit crowded right now,<br/>
&gt;but late in the evening people start packing it in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Musil - you&#39;re right - plenty of good loot, and that&#39;s just on the<br/>
&gt;guards and shaman so far.  I&#39;m level 12 so perhaps I can zoom here<br/>
&gt;quickly.  Only one problem:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The named centaur Dudley mentioned I couldn&#39;t find!  Checked all the<br/>
&gt;centaurs in the camp, none had names on them.  It isn&#39;t much to speed<br/>
&gt;over to N. Karana and the gypsy camp, but a closer merchant would be<br/>
&gt;sweeter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone else run into this Centaur merchant before?  Does he move from<br/>
&gt;the town?<br/>
