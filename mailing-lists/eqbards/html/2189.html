I have never been to<br/>
Mistmore.  Is that an outdoor zone?  What levels is it good for?<br/>

Mistmoore&#39;s funky-good for me right now at 22. Not gotten bored of it yet <br/>
either :P It&#39;s outdoors - which is handy - and the real badass stuff is <br/>
tucked away in the graveyard further back (and in the castle beyond, but we <br/>
won&#39;t talk about *that* ;) so you can pick on a bunch of Initiates that are <br/>
blue, white (black) or yellow to me and the occasional yellow or red <br/>
gargoyle.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say it&#39;s a mid 20&#39;s+ lvl dungeon. I seldom see anyone my level, not to <br/>
blow my own mino horn though - it&#39;s probably just cuz they assume it&#39;s not <br/>
good for them. A group of low 20&#39;s could quite feasibly do really well <br/>
there. Most people are 25-35 lv there, and they&#39;re not going any further <br/>
than the graveyard most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Once you&#39;ve got the main area cleared out and want tougher stuff, you can <br/>
pull from the pass or graveyard where the critters sure yield mighty <br/>
amounts of xp. You can even camp the graveyard, which can be fun in a <br/>
dangerous and nerve-wracking way. But the key to survival is grouping. This <br/>
is a nasty high-level dungeon, I&#39;ve only scratched the surface of it and <br/>
I&#39;ve seen WAY too many crazy-tough trains run past me on many many <br/>
occasions caused by people getting in too deep over their heads. These <br/>
trains come out and create a zone-wide swathe of destruction and chaos, <br/>
consuming everything in their vicious path. Everything... apart from the <br/>
bard and his or her party, who can calmly watch it all transpire as they <br/>
sit... little globes of pulsing invisibility, marvelling at the show. Even <br/>
the highest level nasty impgypsyvampireglyphpsycho has yet to see through <br/>
my invis. Yet ;)<br/>
<br/>
Back to the group question though: As a Bard I initially found it hard to <br/>
really justify my presence there and I died a whole bunch. I still die <br/>
every time I stupidly try to solo or fight in small, unbalanced groups. <br/>
I&#39;ve grouped with 30th lvl people, and 20th lvl people, gotten xp on all <br/>
occasions and I learned that it&#39;s suicide to attempt it at my level without <br/>
a solid group of mid level 20s people with a full complement of tanks, <br/>
casters and healers. So if you go, don&#39;t do anything until you&#39;ve got a <br/>
good group, that&#39;s my advice.<br/>
<br/>
The more people I know now the easier it is to find a group so things are <br/>
better now and I think I&#39;ve established the use of a Bard. We&#39;re not <br/>
stunningly amazing in these situations, but I&#39;m not unhappy either. I&#39;m <br/>
dishing out a whoooole bunch of damage these days, piercing for 12 three <br/>
times in a row and slashing once for .. er.. something (sorry), along with <br/>
a bellow actually damages things pretty effectively when compared to a high <br/>
20&#39;s Paladin or Ranger wielding a BBC or something similar. They sometimes <br/>
let loose with mammoth combos, but they also swing helluva slow and miss a <br/>
lot so sometimes I reckon I may well do more damage than these fellows. <br/>
Probably my imagination though ;)<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby and Lament have come in very handy, although sometimes I really <br/>
regret using them - I take a serious beating in this place... which is why <br/>
I love Clerics so much. A good cleric is ... well.. amazing. But that&#39;s not <br/>
relevant, so I&#39;ll hush about that. ;) As I mentioned, the invis song can be <br/>
of great use... you can finish off whatever you&#39;re fighting as the hardcore <br/>
nasties run to the zone chasing some careless fool... invis yourself and <br/>
watch &#39;em all walk back. Then start taking advantage of the time people <br/>
take to heal and med and poke their heads into the zone and say &quot;is it <br/>
clear now?&quot; for you and your group to really hammer the spawn.<br/>
<br/>
The Rhythms series are good here too... pulling a caster is really <br/>
distressing, so every resist counts. It&#39;s not always feasible to attack it <br/>
where it stands, unfortunately, so if you do encounter one always have this <br/>
song ready cuz these guys can knock you down 400 hp in a flash (well, a few <br/>
flashes, actually ;) One trick is to round as many corners as possible <br/>
between you and them... keep them moving to get that LOS until your people <br/>
can move in on it. They&#39;ve not got many hp so a wiz or 2 can make short <br/>
work of them.<br/>
<br/>
Backstabs are another nasty-nasty. It&#39;s not uncommon to be hit for 140 <br/>
should you get engulfed in some badness. Espcially if you&#39;ll lullabying <br/>
everything around you. I think they actually move around to try and BS you <br/>
while you beat on your target... kinda vicious if that&#39;s so. I like it ;)<br/>
<br/>
The loot is pretty good too. It&#39;s not uncommon to loot a2 or 3 pp&#39;s off <br/>
some of the minor critters. You&#39;ll also get rawhide, vamp blood, gargoyle <br/>
eyes...not amazing, but decent enough. I just wish there were some magical <br/>
stuffs on them. Apart from the shield I don&#39;t know of anything special you <br/>
can get there until you take on Gypsy&#39;s and such... a little disappointing. <br/>
Even the gnolls in BB drop fairly decent magical items.<br/>
<br/>
You can sell to the (uncannily silent) elf merchants in lesser Faydark. <br/>
Finally, it&#39;s a great place to get to know people and just be a Bard... oh <br/>
the angry shouts and /tells I&#39;ve gotten when I&#39;ve composed a little rhyming <br/>
yell to the people who constantly drag trains! The laughs I&#39;ve received as <br/>
I sing out the flaws of the various guilds who come in there regularly to <br/>
&quot;clear this place out!&quot; and end up dying horribly. The praise I&#39;ve gotten <br/>
when I&#39;ve let people know of someone&#39;s good actions... it&#39;s all good ;)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a couple of beefs I have:<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Lament will NOT work, yet the mob won&#39;t attack me when it <br/>
resists. Anyone know why?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Lullaby WILL work, yet I&#39;ll still be hit by the mob that was <br/>
supposedly nodding its head - when no one else has hit it. I know this may <br/>
be as a result of a DOT spell cast on it... but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve been <br/>
soloing and have been attacked by something that just nodded its head, with <br/>
no one else around. Anyone experienced this? If it fails I&#39;m cool with <br/>
that, but if it succeeds it *should* work... no?<br/>
<br/>
Dang, another long message from me. I hope people actually read this far :/ <br/>
I&#39;d like to know the answer(s) to these last beefs.<br/>
