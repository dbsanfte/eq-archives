<div id="ygrps-yiv-903489653">I noticed this last night with regard to chains, which I have kept memmed<br/>
all the time since I got the song (better safe than sorry when a runner<br/>
takes off, I like to have it as a backup just in case).<br/>
<br/>
I was running through sRo on my way to guk and as I crested a dune I bumped<br/>
smack into an SG someone had aggro&#39;d but I kept on running deciding not mess<br/>
with it at the time.  However, I stopped after a bit and turned around to<br/>
notice it was still chasing me so I made an executive decision: &quot;mess with<br/>
the bard, die like the rest. Ok big boy, follow me then...&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I took the SG to the Innothule zone area of sRo and made sure no newbies<br/>
were around and then started to chain/fear him.  I was amazed at the fact<br/>
that the SG stopped running at half health and even though it took me about<br/>
5 minutes and a bar and a half of stamina (I stopped attacking at zero STA<br/>
and rested until back up to half) that I was able to solo him.  He only<br/>
resisted 2 fears out of five minutes worth of twisting and only got in 2<br/>
smacks on me the whole time.  He just stood there and grumbled as I beat the<br/>
living crap out of him.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this was amazing to me because I had never solo&#39;d a giant before and<br/>
I generally DON&#39;T solo as a rule.  Heck he even had a lambent stone and 31pp<br/>
to reward me for my right of passage.<br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story:<br/>
Don&#39;t mess with a bard!  We&#39;re nice enough folks but if you tick us off<br/>
you&#39;re going down baby :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; char is pretty amazing).  Our groups biggest problem is no <br/>
&gt; snare (we are<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior/bard/cleric/wizard), but chains aren;&#39;t too far away for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard.  (We also have a friend training up a necro who will <br/>
&gt; give us the<br/>
&gt; &gt; darkness spells)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my experience, the darkness line is inferior to snare.  <br/>
&gt; Stuff with darkness on it will start to run *before* the<br/>
&gt; darkness will halt their movement.  So they&#39;ll still manage to<br/>
&gt; flee a bit depending on how quickly you&#39;re damaging it.  <br/>
&gt; Early on Chain acts pretty much like snare.  But later (level<br/>
&gt; thirty-something?) it will stop runners when they&#39;re at half<br/>
&gt; hp.  That makes it superior to snare for stopping green<br/>
&gt; runners, since greenies tend to run when they drop below half.<br/>
