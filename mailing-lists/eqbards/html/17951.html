<div id="ygrps-yiv-719361652">When I charm, I hold my *drum* because Selos is the key to successful<br/>
charming.  Keep Selos going at all times.  Especially when you first get<br/>
charm and don&#39;t have a lot of hp and dont want to get hit, you will be doing<br/>
the charm thing from a distance.  I&#39;d strongly suggest learning charm in the<br/>
great outdoors where you have room to manuver and escape if you need to.<br/>
Also, I would suggest practicing on stuff you can kill two of without charm.<br/>
Much of it is learning the distance from the mob to cast the song.  I have<br/>
only 2 hotkeys for charming: /pet attack and /pet guard me (actually /pet<br/>
guard me also has /pet who leader and /time on the same social hot key).<br/>
<br/>
Selos around and find 2 things to charm.  With Selos playing, Sirens on one,<br/>
eyes glaze over, target other & /pet attack. Selos again and move away.<br/>
When you see the &quot;your charm has ended...&quot; message, keep Selos going and get<br/>
into position to charm again. Usually this means look at your now 2<br/>
attackers and when your former pet is close enough, re-charm.  As you ar<br/>
recharming, move away. And because you kept Selos going, you can move away<br/>
at speed.  Believe me you will be happy you did. Eyes glaze over.  Play<br/>
Selos again and move away.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have just hit the magical level 27 over the weekend. I have talked to<br/>
many people in game that say<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t get much benefit from more Charisma over my 123 I have now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now the question I have is this true? If so can you advise some equipment<br/>
for me to get to raise my<br/>
&gt; charisma up some? Also should I use a Mino Horn or just hold my crude<br/>
stein? </span></blockquote></div>
