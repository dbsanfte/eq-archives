<div id="ygrps-yiv-575572178">If they were overmatched that badly, you could not have done a<br/>
single thing to turn the tide of battle. The other Bard should<br/>
have Accel&#39;d them out of there. If the 16th Bard couldnt hit it<br/>
much, you would have been whiffing like a minor leaguer at 13th<br/>
level. As for escape, its not your job to sacrifice your life<br/>
when they had every opportunity to run themselves. That amounts<br/>
to them saying, &quot;Why should we run? We will just let YOU get<br/>
slaughtered if we cant manage to win and claim the loot!&quot; I<br/>
have died more times than I can count saving people who get<br/>
waylaid, trained, or are running for the zone because they<br/>
are making an effort. But someone who just stands there till<br/>
its too late because they are so greedy to kill a premium loot<br/>
mob is on his own. <br/>

I had a disturbing situation happen the other day.  I was sharing the<br/>
sisters bandit camp in Lesser fay with a group of 3 others.  All of the<br/>
other players were 15-16 level and in a group, and consisted of a Ranger,<br/>
Bard, and a Magician.  At the time I was 15th level and am quite capable of<br/>
soloing the camp while alone, so I wasen&#39;t milking off them.  We had a good<br/>
thing going and were being very friendly to one another untill something odd<br/>
happend.<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting for my spawn, when I heared the sounds of battle behind me.  I<br/>
figured that they were killing a giant spider or somthing in between spawns<br/>
as I often do.  But something didn&#39;t sound right.  I turned around to see<br/>
the 16th level Bard and the 15th level Ranger, attacking a named Brownie.<br/>
My jaw dropped as I asessed the situation.  The brownie was hardly hit at<br/>
all and the two where below half health already.  Now was my time for snap<br/>
deciscions.  Should I help out, or should I bug out.  <br/>

<br/>
I ended up stopping for the night to try think of anything I could have done<br/>
better, it all happend so fast.  Any suggestions?<br/>
