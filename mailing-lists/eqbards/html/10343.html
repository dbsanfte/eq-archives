I&#39;ve seen high teen bards with lotsa dough and<br/>
connections that already have the lambent BP and other<br/>
pieces,<br/>
<br/>

Hehe, you wouldn&#39;t happen to be talking about me,<br/>
would you? :) Just before I dinged 20, I managed to<br/>
get the greaves, bp and gauntlets. The greaves and<br/>
gauntlets were a gracious gift from my mother. The bp<br/>
I got on my own (I had help only as far as killing the<br/>
mob, a lvl50 bud nuked the gypsy for me, I still had<br/>
to go into the house (shiver)) I did get my own<br/>
gauntlets, too. But, I&#39;m a merchant bard. I didn&#39;t<br/>
have much trouble getting the gauntlets, and some guy<br/>
offered me an insane amount for them... So, my mother<br/>
gave me hers, silly half elf that she is.. She says<br/>
blue isn&#39;t her color, and they clash with her mithril.<br/>
As far as cash... At level 20, my character is more or<br/>
less insanely wealthy. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time<br/>
getting this cash... I&#39;m somewhere around 25 days<br/>
played, at lvl 20. It&#39;s nice, but now that I have a<br/>
surname, people think I&#39;m way older then I am. A group<br/>
I unknowingly joined in Cazic brought me into the tae<br/>
room. 2 hulking gorillas made exceptionally short work<br/>
of me. Yeowch... And the beggars... &quot;u giv me xtra<br/>
waep pls??&quot; I hate them. If you can amuse me, or rp<br/>
well, I&#39;ll toss some shinies at you, if you can&#39;t type<br/>
a sentence in full, begone. Enough of my rant.<br/>
