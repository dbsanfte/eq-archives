<div id="ygrps-yiv-737280690">Greetings, I am a newly 27th bard ON tarrew Marr and I have a couple<br/>
questions reguards a few songs.<br/>
<br/>
I know psalm of warmth adds a 5 point damage shield. I am wondering how much<br/>
damage the the psalm of cold is?<br/>
<br/>
2. the song Psalm of Vitality as I have listed is JUST poison resist. Since<br/>
it is a Psalm I am wondering if it ( and psalm of purity as well) are damage<br/>
shields as well and if so how much.<br/>
<br/>
3. I have pretty much started to phase out bellow song to use the slot for<br/>
something more group oriented. My question is the level 30 Fufils curtailing<br/>
chant. It stated target damage and -magic resist. I would like to know more<br/>
about this song i e how much dd it does and is that song worth taking up a<br/>
song slot for another DD song? how much MR does it lower? This follows along<br/>
with my curiosity of the other chants (flame etc)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the information ahead of time..<br/>
<br/>
Tuldar newly 27th song.</div>
