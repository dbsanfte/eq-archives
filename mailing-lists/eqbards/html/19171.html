<div id="ygrps-yiv-367478238">This is an off topic thread so this will be my last<br/>
commment here, anyone is more than welcome to send me<br/>
a private email to continue discussing it if they<br/>
like, however.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Uhh actually depending on race putting points in <br/>
&gt;strength is a valid character creation strategy for a<br/>
<br/>
&gt;necro.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have to be carefull here.  If I want to have a<br/>
whatever race necro and max his strength for RP<br/>
reasons that then becomes a valid creation strategy so<br/>
obviously we can&#39;t be talking about that.  However,<br/>
from a numbers point of view (which is what Abashi was<br/>
implying) str is meaningless.  For a necro<br/>
specifically get your int to 200, perhaps raise your<br/>
cha for screaming terror and after that you want to<br/>
work on raising +hp, +mana, +ac and +resist items. <br/>
All of these will help you more than strength.  In<br/>
other words by putting 10pts in str at creation thats<br/>
more 10 more int of equipment you need to wear to make<br/>
up for it...that can be a significant<br/>
hp/mana/ac/resist loss.  What most people overlook by<br/>
thinking that its easy to get to 200 int is you can<br/>
only do so through a loss in other very important<br/>
areas.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My druid after all has a base strength that is only <br/>
&gt;10 points lower than his wisdom.  I sure will never <br/>
&gt;have the mana reserves of other druids, but I can <br/>
&gt;melee far better than they can.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Druids are an area I know well actually.  The question<br/>
here is did you compare AC and weapon/offense/defense<br/>
skills as well?  A kiting druid often lets his skills<br/>
lag and focuses on +wis equipment rather than AC gear<br/>
as well.  Amusing side note...when I was level 50 I<br/>
tested my druid&#39;s melee vs ogre bouncers.  Using the<br/>
exact same equipment and spells (dot, damage shield<br/>
and greater heal only) I was *more* effective with Paw<br/>
and CGS in hand than Weapon and Paw. :)<br/>
