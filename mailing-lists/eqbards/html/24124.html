<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969783860">Started a group in Seb last night.  We had a great group doing <br/>
Shrooms when the Warrior had to leave suddenly. We zoned out and <br/>
regrouped up top while we found a tank.  The rogue in our party <br/>
finally found a replacement while we were hanging out at B3.<br/>
<br/>
When the guy joined, I commented that we should head to the crypt... <br/>
I knew it was already camped.<br/>
<br/>
This warrior says, &quot;No.. No crypt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I ask, &quot;Why no crypt?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He says, &quot;I spent 10 levels there as my main (60 Rogue) and I&#39;m bored <br/>
of it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say, &quot;Well, then where&#39;s my BoH?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He says, &quot;heh, I got 2.  One&#39;s on my twink, I traded the other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say, &quot;What level is your Bard?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He say, &quot;Level 33&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jokingly, I say, &quot;Hmm.. that thing doesn&#39;t proc, yet.  You should <br/>
give it to me where it would get some use.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He says, &quot;I like all my twinks to look good in the character <br/>
selection screen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
/boggle<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A little bit of time passes and it becomes clear a few of his skills <br/>
are subpar.  His taunt skill especially.  Turns out he was <br/>
powerleveled to 50.<br/>
<br/>
A little bit more time passes and the Rogue decides she is tired of <br/>
pulling.  The Warrior says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say, &quot;Let&#39;s see.. Our Tank can&#39;t taunt and won&#39;t pull....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He laughs and finally starts to pull.... about 5 at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
(I have no friggin clue where he found 5 mobs to pull.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
sitting at B3 for at least an hour, probably 2.. it should have been <br/>
WELL broken... It was probably revenge for forcing him to pull.)<br/>
<br/>
So, we handle the first batch, then he pulls another large batch.  <br/>
We&#39;re almost finished with the 2nd batch as I&#39;m moving around, <br/>
targeting, mezzing like crazy, and he says, &quot;I&#39;m too lazy to play <br/>
more than 1 song on my Bard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seemed to me like that &quot;lazy&quot; factor applied to all his characters.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, we had to &quot;head out&quot; shortly thereafter.<br/>
