<div id="ygrps-yiv-905711007">I have a strength of 120 and stamina of 110.  I get 30 hit points per level<br/>
(except for level 15 I got 31.  I think it was because I had a +1 to stamina<br/>
item on me.)<br/>
<br/>
At level 20 I had 606 hit points.  A level 20 barbarian warrior with the<br/>
same strength but 115 stamina had 613 hit points - 7 more for 5 points of<br/>
stamina.<br/>
<br/>
To keep this on a bard topic,  my bard has 90 strength and 75 stamina :)<br/>
Just in case you wanted that info.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and my hit points when I ran into Nixx was 576 not 571.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I found the same thing in Paw a couple of weeks ago.  There was a dark<br/>
&gt; elf<br/>
&gt; &gt;necromancer named Nixx Nenix roaming Paw.  I was just coming out after<br/>
&gt; &gt;successfully defeating Shaman Ren Rex and saw a dark elf swimming.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;figured it was another player until he tagged with a damage over time<br/>
&gt; (DOT).<br/>
&gt; &gt;I made it to the zone before he could catch me and zoned out and the DOT<br/>
&gt; &gt;still took me down 3 and 1/2 bubbles of health (I had 571 hit points at<br/>
&gt; &gt;level 19).<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Apologize beforehand for adding to the increasing number of off topic<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; posts<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; on this list but I had an encounter last night with a NPC in Highpass<br/>
&gt; hold<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that I had never seen or heard of before.  I was camping the Mucktail<br/>
&gt; site<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; with a level 29 cleric.  While we were waiting, we start to see<br/>
&gt; messages<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; scroll through &quot;Cytodl Krish begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Next thing we<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; get attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard)<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; blue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; both<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; had to make a run for the Keep zone.  We fully recharged and went out<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; looking for him.  I was singing invis and had elemental and purifying<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; ryhthms ready to weave.  We finally found the necro wandering around<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; zone, with a bunch of corpses in his wake.  We attacked at the cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tried<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; rooting him several times. He kept resisting and the cleric was OOM<br/>
&gt; (oops,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; used an acronym).  We had to run to the border again.  We recharged and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tracked him down once again.  The second time, the cleric just kept<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; smiting<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; him and we eventually killed him.  All told did over 800 damage to him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; He<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; didn&#39;t drop any loot which was a disappointment.  When we killed him,<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; factions affected, which all got worse, were The Dead, King and Queen<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; some wierd name, Keepers of the Art, and Eldritch Collective.  After<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; fight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC<br/>
&gt; before.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; No<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; one in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; could shed some light on his background?  Also wanted to warn everyone<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; case they ran into him and they were less level 30 they should be<br/>
&gt; prepared<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to run.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; BTW, by the way he was acting, almost 100% certain it wasn&#39;t a GM<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; controlled<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; NPC.<br/>
