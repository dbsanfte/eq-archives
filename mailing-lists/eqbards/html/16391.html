<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447235164">Nope definitely wasn&#39;t me.  I really like that idea but never heard it<br/>
before, must have been when I was just deleting most posts as I was way busy<br/>
here at work.  How would you code that though?  I&#39;d love anything that would<br/>
make people consider the consequences of their actions more.  Better yet,<br/>
make him suffer a portion of the xp lost by all those he killed!  Talk about<br/>
stopping intentional training!<br/>

&gt; are doing a major guild outing to Sol A to try the Predator, our scouting<br/>

&gt; suspect we were feign trained as when the corpse recovery team got back to<br/>
&gt; the room it was camped by another group.  Since the CR team was only gone<br/>
&gt; the length of time it took to run back from their gate point on the Sol B<br/>
&gt; zoneline, it was awfully convenient.  Especially since one of their number<br/>
&gt; was a monk that two members were sure they saw dead as they ran towards<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; zoneline.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like it.  The lava elemental is pretty far the predator<br/>
spot.  OTOH, if it was a blazing elemental, that&#39;s a bit<br/>
closer.<br/>
<br/>
Weren&#39;t you the one who shot down my idea of faction hits for<br/>
getting other players killed?  It would really help with<br/>
situations like this (whether it was intentional or<br/>
accidental), forcing people to consider the consequences of<br/>
their escape attempt on others instead of only their own skin.<br/>
