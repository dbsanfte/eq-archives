Dunno... it might, then again it might not.  It only really needs to react<br/>
to the data in the client that was given to it by the server already (IE:<br/>
Is someone standing there or not)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Drop Flags<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have been a programmer for years.  Obviously some of you have as well.<br/>
You&#39;re over-analyzing this though.  All they&#39;d have to do is add one flag to<br/>
the client and one check to the drop process.  All in all roughly 4 lines of<br/>
code to do it clunky.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1)  Flag on client<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Add Flag<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CanDropItems = Binary<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Add code to drop check<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When clicking in view area<br/>
&gt; If Isareaempty = no then opentradewindow<br/>
&gt; Else<br/>
&gt; If CanDropItems = No then keepitemonmouse<br/>
&gt; Else<br/>
&gt; Drop Item<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t the most elegant pseudocode but it should get the idea across.<br/>
Sure I may not have their exact process down but this would be a VERY easy<br/>
patch to put in regardless of how they have it coded.  Even if the hook<br/>
isn&#39;t already there it&#39;s 1 flag easily added to the engine.   It&#39;s not a<br/>
major change to how the engine works.  They added the Destroy box in a 40kb<br/>
patch during beta and I guarantee that wasn&#39;t in the client then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Furthermore, Gordon has stated on at least 2 occasions that I can recall<br/>
that they have something like this on the &quot;list&quot; but it&#39;s not high priority.<br/>
