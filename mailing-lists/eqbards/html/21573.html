<b>Subject:</b> Drolvarg fangs - who to turn them into, etc.?  Programmable keypa ds? <br/>

<br/>
Congrats on your tambourine.  I have the Star of Odus - guild brother got it<br/>
for me and delivered it to me so I didn&#39;t have to boat over to Erudin = ).<br/>
I am now officially collecting the coins.  One thing you mentioned below was<br/>
turning in Drolvarg fangs.  I assume this is a quest we can do similar to<br/>
the Blackburrow gnoll fangs of way back when except here the xp seems pretty<br/>
good.  Where do you find Drolvargs, what level do you need to be to hunt<br/>
them (you are 40, but were you solo or in a group with higher or lower<br/>
mates), how did you hunt them (charm kite, chant kite, both, group,...) and<br/>
finally, who do you turn them into?  And when you said 3 pixels, did you<br/>
mean 3 xp bar sections?  If so, wow!  Please, if others have info on<br/>
Drolvargs, please share it with me.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; i just got my tamborine last night and i must say im<br/>
&gt; a happy camper, it gave<br/>
&gt; me 2 pixels in level 40! that and i handed in 56<br/>
&gt; drolvarg fangs at the same<br/>
&gt; time, so i got 3 pixels for all of that stuff,<br/>
&gt; needless to say i was happy<br/>
&gt; the bloody captain was finally where he was supposed<br/>
&gt; to be. I had a spare<br/>
&gt; dalnir coin which i gave to another guy i was<br/>
&gt; grouped with which hadnt<br/>
&gt; started getting his coins, i think he will now...<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know that I will buy one, but with the new patch changes, I<br/>
certainly want to research them.  Please post the links and maybe even some<br/>
of the how to(if you haven&#39;t already).  Kit and Windleaf, great ideas for<br/>
missed notes.  I almost played around with the new stuff last night, but I<br/>
knew you all would have some great ideas here today.  Way to go(again)!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

	I will tell you what has changed - voice recognition.  The moment<br/>
the EQ team started down that path, most of these command line changes were<br/>
inevitable.  <br/>
<br/>
	What you guys need are programmable keyboards&#92;keypads.  I have a<br/>
58-key programmable keypad I use to do all sorts of things -- its primary<br/>
use however is to give me direction keys on BOTH ends of the keyboard, as<br/>
well as a better layout for hotkeys, etc.  Not to mention I can switch<br/>
hot-key banks, and press a hot key button with a simple push of a key.<br/>
Since the implementation of all these keyboard commands, I can do damn near<br/>
any command or sequence of commands in EQ with my keypad at the push of a<br/>
single button.<br/>
<br/>
	The price range of the programmable keypads on the internet is<br/>
anywhere from 24.95 (a cheap 20-key type) on up.  There are two available<br/>
from one particular company in 20 ($85) and 58 ($130) key models that allow<br/>
key labeling and everything .  If you guys are interested I can post some<br/>
links for your perusal.</div>
