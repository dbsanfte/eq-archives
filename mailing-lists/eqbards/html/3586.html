<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124946253">Well hell - REAL simple solution to this - just have something popup to<br/>
accept a bind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not real sure I like &#39;beneficial&#39; spells of certain types just castable<br/>
on anyone, anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
How many magic users loose their pets to some idiot that thinks it&#39;s cute<br/>
to invis them?<br/>
<br/>
With levitate bugs - I HATE someone just doing that without asking me.<br/>

&gt;I hate to reply to this in a bards group ... but ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The reason non-casters can&#39;t be bound to a non-city area is simple:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;they can&#39;t &quot;unbind&quot; themselves as easily as a caster can &quot;unbind&quot;<br/>
&gt;himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If they allowed everyone the ability to be bound in any zone, and<br/>
&gt;only gave the bind ability to casters, the following &quot;abuse&quot; would<br/>
&gt;happen:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A spellcaster would get into your group.  He gets mad about some<br/>
&gt;disagreement in the group.  The next time your group camps in some<br/>
&gt;dangerous area, he binds everyone to that spot.  He then leaves.  The<br/>
&gt;moment anyone dies, they&#39;ll find themselves in the middle of an orc<br/>
&gt;camp!  Infinite Please Loading ...  And they have to pay another<br/>
&gt;spellcaster to get bind in another spot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As it is, it&#39;s livable.  You just have to find a spellcaster to bind<br/>
&gt;you, and it seems there are plenty of city-zones nearby.  It also<br/>
&gt;forces players to be more careful with where they hunt, and how they<br/>
&gt;explore dungeons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would still like to have a solution to all the downtime we spend<br/>
&gt;running through zones just to get our corpses.  I&#39;d also like to get<br/>
&gt;an auto-equip-armor instead of having to click the armor onto my<br/>
&gt;portrait.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But all this should be in a gameplay forum.<br/>
