<b>Subject:</b> Old Question -- Has JM or anyone official ever answered it? Jig a nd Mana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-404364523">Does the Jig really effect Mana regen rate?  I still haven&#39;t been able to do<br/>
any scientific experimentation, and I know that while this was discussed<br/>
pretty heavily a while back, I&#39;m not sure I ever saw any sort of definitive<br/>
answer come from it, just theories about stamina and meditation being on the<br/>
same pulse rate.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone done any hard studies?  Or did JM answer this in a post I missed<br/>
while on vacation?<br/>
