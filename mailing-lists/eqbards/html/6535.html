&gt; I was trying the &quot;all songs&quot; concept, and it DOESN&#39;T WORK.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just for safety, I was in Splitpaw, where there are only 3 things that will<br/>
&gt; attack me: Ghanex Drah, his pet and the occasional wandering zombie.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Welp....<br/>
&gt; 1st round:  with weapons, I barely killed Ghanex, half killed his pet, then<br/>
&gt; died.<br/>
&gt; 2nd round. with weapons, I barely killed Ghanex, did hardly anything to his<br/>
&gt; pet, then died.<br/>
&gt; 3rd round. songs only, I didn&#39;t do half health to Ghanex.  WHY?!!?!<br/>
&gt; I was weaving DDD with brass, and Chords and Hymn on strings, but still, he<br/>
&gt; barely took any damage.<br/>
&gt; Why did I lose a level on this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Using DDD and CoD you probably do less damage over time than<br/>
using weapons, but because you&#39;re also playing Hymn with a<br/>
lute, you last a lot longer in a fight.  Net effect is that<br/>
DDD/CoD/Hymn take longer to kill something, but you can<br/>
survive a lot longer because of your increased hp regeneration<br/>
rate.<br/>
<br/>
Ghanex is a necro - a caster.  Using instruments can backfire<br/>
when you&#39;re fighting a caster because the best strategy when<br/>
fighting a caster is to kill him as quickly as possible.  <br/>
Whereas against a melee mob your increased rate of hp<br/>
regeneration using DDD/CoD/Hymn was enough to significantly<br/>
offset the additional damage you took, against a caster it<br/>
makes a smaller difference.<br/>
<br/>
e.g. Say you&#39;re fighting a mob with 120 hp.  Say it&#39;s a melee<br/>
mob and you&#39;re taking 10 damage/sec (numbers made up to<br/>
illustrate the point).<br/>
<br/>
Fighting with weapons you&#39;re doing damage at 6 dam/sec, so it<br/>
takes you 20 seconds to kill him.  You&#39;re healing at 4 hp/sec,<br/>
so the net damage you take is (10-4) = 6 dam/sec.  Over 20 sec<br/>
you take 120 points of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting with instruments, you&#39;re doing damage at 4 dam/sec,<br/>
so it takes you 30 seconds to kill him.  You&#39;re healing at 8<br/>
hp/sec however, so the net damage you take is (10-8) = 2<br/>
damage/sec.  Over 30 sec you take 60 points of damage.<br/>
Instruments work better than weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Now say you&#39;re fighting a casting mob, again with 120 hp but<br/>
this time it does 25 damage/sec.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting with weapons it still takes you 20 seconds to kill<br/>
him.  The net damage you take is (25-4) = 21 dam/sec.  Over 20<br/>
sec you take 420 points of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting with instruments it still takes you 30 seconds to<br/>
kill him.  The net damage you take is (25-8) = 17 dam/sec.<br/>
Over 30 seconds you take 510 points of damage.  Weapons work<br/>
better than instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Summary:<br/>
<br/>
Melee mob with weapons = 120 points damage taken<br/>
Melee mob with instruments = 60 points damage taken<br/>
<br/>
Casting mob with weapons = 420 points damage taken<br/>
Casting mob with instruments = 510 points damage taken<br/>
<br/>
Hope that was understandable.  :-)<br/>
