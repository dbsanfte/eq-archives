&gt; I have the Lute, and as far as I can tell there is no increase in song<br/>
&gt; effects. =(<br/>
&gt; That was what you were saying right?<br/>
&gt; Noone has the lute?<br/>
&gt; -or-<br/>
&gt; People who have the lute say there is no effect?<br/>
&gt; Either way, I cant see an increase. Maybe I just suck and need to be a<br/>
&gt; higher level to command the magic.<br/>

&gt; &gt;the drum does, but no one has found the lute to increase any <br/>
&gt; string song<br/>
&gt; &gt;effects.  perhaps it is a quest item or it is broken.<br/>
