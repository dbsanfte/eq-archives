&gt; &lt;&lt; I used this song to practice up my brass skill a bit.  I<br/>
&gt;  feared a bunch of snakes, skunks, etc. in Butcherblock and set<br/>
&gt;  myself on a hill near a goblin camp &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone seems to think that the only way to practice brass is to have <br/>
&gt; something being hit by the effect. I know for a fact that this isnt true. I <br/>
&gt; set myself up on the side of a mountain in a newbie zone playing DDD for but <br/>
&gt; 4 hours (this was at 18 when it was the first brass song); I gained almost 60 <br/>
&gt; points in that time even though nothing was being targeted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I wasn&#39;t afk during that time, and I certainly wasn&#39;t<br/>
going to watch myself doing nothing for 4 hours.  And because<br/>
I played with Screech the way I did instead of leaving my<br/>
character playing it overnight in the Arena, I could answer<br/>
the question that started this thread.  :-)<br/>
