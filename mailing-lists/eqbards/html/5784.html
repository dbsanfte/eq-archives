&gt;Hehe- I found my lev 30_+ caster fiends retrieving their corpses from the<br/>
&gt;ogres one day.  Our enchanter fiend could cast Ogre form and walk in and<br/>
&gt;drag corpses out.  I did the same thing and saw amiable and being a bard<br/>
&gt;thought np ill buzz right on by...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;you writhe in agony<br/>
&gt;you writhe in agony<br/>
&gt;Loading, please wait...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then some time I helped a mage get his corpse from somewhere near that<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and dint think much of it.  But yesterday I get a tell from him and he axes<br/>
&gt;&quot;do you remember me?&quot; Well, he says he&#39;s gonna camp these ogers and would I<br/>
&gt;like some loots? Oh ya, he&#39;s a lev 48 magician.  So, I go watch him do his<br/>
&gt;stuff.  He says they are all green to him but like all of us, he hates<br/>

&gt;for the next 2 plus hours we camp.  He wants some earring and some veil<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;He&#39;s got a hp-to-mana spell he casts on himself and I am busy healing<br/>
&gt;between fites. Pet does most of the work and can solo guards if they are<br/>
&gt;dumb enuff to charge him while he meds.  He can stand off and cast them<br/>

&gt;bellow from the edge of the melee and taunt their pets off _our_ pet.<br/>
&gt;Chief&#39;s dog is a nasty yeller but cant make up his mind who to attack - esp<br/>
&gt;if our pet is whacking the Chief.  The shapersons and the chief drop the<br/>
&gt;good loots - rest of them drop rusty, misc large leather armor, misc bronze<br/>
&gt;wep and fs wep, occasion 2-3plat, mostly few gp or sp, various words pages<br/>
&gt;and ruins.  The sha and chief dropped some bone armor - legs and arms.<br/>

&gt;this.  But casters can wear it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He (his pet) killed the Chief mucho times.  There is a priest(ess?) that<br/>
&gt;never spawned during our camp.  At one time, I think he got kinda sleepy<br/>
&gt;waiting and the camp started to fill up. I got nervous because he was not<br/>
&gt;attacking each one like before and not responding to tells and now the<br/>
&gt;guards and the Chief are up.  So, do I leave him to a certain death and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>save<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;myself before it&#39;s too late?? Or do I decide to get &quot;creative&quot; and think we<br/>
&gt;might be OK if I make us invis.  Well, I should know better but I did it<br/>
&gt;anyways.  Mage pets and our invis don&#39;t get along at all.  Any how -<br/>
 </span></blockquote>KABOOM!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;his pet dies as we go invis and I guess the noise woke him up.  He attacks<br/>
&gt;the rest of the camp and clears it.  I have to fess up and explain that it<br/>
&gt;was me that schwacked his pet and he goes &quot;hehe - lol&quot;  I guess you need a<br/>
&gt;sense of humor to get to lev 48 :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt;Trying to figure out why they attacked me I make a circle<br/>
&gt;around the temple<br/>
&gt; &gt;making sure to con everything there. Ah, there it is. Chief<br/>
&gt;Dooga.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Threateningly. How rude.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That would be the same Ogre camp that caused me to offer 50<br/>

&gt; teleport to the Karanas when I was trying to do my &quot;fastest<br/>
