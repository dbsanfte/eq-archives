<div id="ygrps-yiv-277663693">A great bard does not need to twist 5 songs.  A bard who twists 3 or more<br/>
songs knows what he is doing and is playing his character well.  Playing<br/>
your character well has nothing to do with how much expensive computer<br/>
equipment you can afford or how good your equipment is.<br/>
