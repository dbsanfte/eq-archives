&gt; I have a question about 36th? song Versus Of Celerity. From what I was told<br/>
&gt; and have seen on the web etc this song is only listed as an AGIL buff. Thats<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is, is that true? There is no attack speed to it? There is an<br/>
&gt; enchanter buff called Celerity which is an upgrade to their attack speed<br/>
&gt; spell Alacrity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot of web sites are wrong.  Most of the stuff on Rokenn&#39;s<br/>
web site is correct because he and I (and others) are actively<br/>
checking the stuff to make sure it&#39;s accurate.  Celerity gives<br/>
an agi buff (which in turn causes an AC increase), and it<br/>
gives a 15% boost to attack speed using:<br/>
<br/>
100 * (1 - new_delay/old_delay)<br/>
<br/>
This is roughly half the enchanter Celerity speedup (which<br/>
varies by level, but I haven&#39;t noticed any level variance with<br/>
our Celerity).  AFAIK, all our attack speedups are half the<br/>
equivalent-level enchanter speedups.  Verant &quot;nerfed&quot; them for<br/>
balance reasons by making them singing-only, which typically<br/>
halves the effect.<br/>
