<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940470208">Wow.. Thanks for the thorough explanation (slow day at work?  :)  Seems to me the most feasible of these<br/>
is the method from the kitchen.  It also helps that quite frequently the maid room is camped.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
come up from the jail side, so I&#39;m unfamiliar with that route.  I&#39;m intrigued by the invis idea.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t really mesh well with the way I thought invis works.  But we should definitely do more testing on<br/>
it!  You&#39;d have to walk up and do something to break invis (like attack) JUST before your next invis<br/>
pulse.  Could we have the successor to monk feign death pulling?  Heh.   I doubt it too.. but heck, we<br/>
should try it!  What&#39;s a few more trains in Mistmoore among friends?  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Got a question for you guys.  Now that I&#39;m level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 32, I&#39;ve on a couple of occasions managed to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; in pretty decent groups in Mistmoore.  Is there<br/>
&gt; &gt; any practical way to pull musicians from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; castle once you have control of, say, the plateau<br/>
&gt; &gt; in front of the castle?  This is with a mid-30&#39;s<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heh heh.  Short answer:  No.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Long answer:  My guild and I tried this over the weekend.  We<br/>
&gt; caused probably one of the biggest trains in the history of<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore.  From what I could tell, the music room, negotiator<br/>
&gt; room, piano/window room (and stuff outside), and all the mobs<br/>
&gt; in the little nooks and crannies in between came pouring out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The plateu in front of the castle is easy to break (go in<br/>
&gt; invis to the far side, drop invis, and lull everything you<br/>
&gt; see, then pull).  The mobs just inside the gate (there are 2-4<br/>
&gt; of them) are easy as well, as are the two gargoyles in the<br/>
&gt; grand hall/lobby.  You got this far:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; group.  I have been in a group once that actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; managed to fight their way into the lobby (with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the stairs going to second floor, etc.) but then<br/>
&gt; &gt; we couldn&#39;t figure out how to reasonably go much<br/>
&gt; &gt; further due to large clusters of mobs at such odd<br/>
&gt; &gt; angles that lament wasn&#39;t really doable, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Plus the fact that everyone was scared out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; their minds because of the stories of bad pathing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; trains, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yup.  Be glad you didn&#39;t try it.  I got to this point, tried<br/>
&gt; to come up with a way to lament the mobs but couldn&#39;t.  So I<br/>
&gt; had a ranger try casting harmony.  That&#39;s when we started that<br/>
&gt; train.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The problem isn&#39;t that lament or harmony don&#39;t work - they<br/>
&gt; do.  The problem is that the pathing is so screwed up that the<br/>
&gt; mobs take circuitous routes.  You pull the mob in front of the<br/>
&gt; music room, and instead of following you, it will circle<br/>
&gt; around the entire music room, out the back door, through the<br/>
&gt; negotiator room, then through the lobby, incidently pulling<br/>
&gt; everything it meets along the way.  There *might* be a way to<br/>
&gt; pull it semi-safely (I suspect you can pull the negotiator<br/>
&gt; room by itself), but I&#39;m not going to risk getting other<br/>
&gt; innocents killed in trains figuring out how.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are several ways to safely get to the music room.  By<br/>
&gt; far the easiest is to have a high level person pull.  We had a<br/>
&gt; L48 person do it, but I hear a L47 can do it as well.  Most of<br/>
&gt; the stuff won&#39;t aggro on a person this high, so he can pull,<br/>
&gt; the mob can go through its convoluted pathing, and it won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; trigger any extras.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t have a high level person, someone in wolf form<br/>
&gt; who hasn&#39;t played much in Mistmoore can pull just a few at a<br/>
&gt; time (I think agro radius is linked to faction).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t have any of these, you have two options I know<br/>
&gt; of.  First is to invis your party and go back into the<br/>
&gt; kitchen.  Kill the three mobs there, clear the hallway, then<br/>
&gt; the maid and bulter rooms.  Then comes the hard part - using<br/>
&gt; invis to move around, lull the gargoyles in front of the<br/>
&gt; negotiator room.  Once they&#39;re lulled, you can position<br/>
&gt; yourself to lull stuff inside the negotiator room (the agro<br/>
&gt; radius extends beyond the door so don&#39;t get too close).  If<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll get 1-3 mobs at a time.  If you&#39;re not so<br/>
&gt; lucky, you&#39;ll get the entire negotiator room, the three mobs<br/>
&gt; in the alcove beyond it, and a couple gargs (which is the<br/>
&gt; monster pull I described in my other post).  Once the<br/>
&gt; negotiator room is clear, you can start to crack the music<br/>
&gt; room.  I haven&#39;t gotten this far, so I can&#39;t help you beyond<br/>
&gt; this point.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other option is go in the back way, through the jail.<br/>
&gt; Clear up to just before the pool room.  If Xicotl is not up,<br/>
&gt; you can clear the pool room, then pull the room down the<br/>
&gt; stairs.  If Xicotl is up, you&#39;re probably best off invising<br/>
&gt; everyone and just going down the stairs to the next room and<br/>
&gt; clearing there.  After that is the piano room - make sure you<br/>
&gt; fight away from the windows or you&#39;ll pull the entire outside<br/>
&gt; as well.  Clear the outside if you want to be safe.  Then the<br/>
&gt; alcove just before the music room.  After this I&#39;m not sure,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;ve seen other groups pull the music room from here so it<br/>
&gt; must be possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a theory on another way to pull.  I was invis and had<br/>
&gt; SoW on, and started what should&#39;ve been a train.  All I got<br/>
&gt; was three mobs.  I think what happened is that after I<br/>
&gt; triggered the first mob and it started its screwed up pathing,<br/>
&gt; my invis kicked in making me indifferent to everything else.<br/>
&gt; So the castle didn&#39;t get aggroed when the three mobs passed by<br/>
&gt; them (kinda like how green mobs won&#39;t trigger if you let a<br/>
&gt; runner get away).  I haven&#39;t really tested if this is what is<br/>
&gt; really happening, so use it at your own risk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All this becomes much easier of course if another group has<br/>
&gt; partially cleared the inside.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So there you have it, pretty much all I&#39;ve learned about<br/>
&gt; the castle in Mistmoore.<br/>
