<div id="ygrps-yiv-487957553">i still haven&#39;t tried the level 40 song since it was fixed, keep forgetting.<br/>
i have heard that it is a single target dispel magic song, removing one icon<br/>
per tick.  perhaps the level 22 song is a preventative song, meaning you<br/>
must be playing it to avoid getting charmed, as opposed to playing it after<br/>
a group member is charmed.  maybe get two bards (one level 22+ the other<br/>
level 28+) and one other person together.  have the level 22+ bard and 3rd<br/>
person group, and have the level 28+ bard alone and try to charm both people<br/>
in the group while the 22+ bard sings level 22 disenchanting melody and see<br/>
if charm works.  i&#39;m either too lazy or more likely will forget to try this<br/>

&gt; Greeting fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt; I was under the impression that the Antimagic Song was an AOE <br/>
&gt; or party only <br/>
&gt; that prevented harmful spells from being cast on the party by <br/>
&gt; any attacking <br/>
&gt; mobs. I watched my husband and his group in beta attack the <br/>
&gt; Karanas Ogre <br/>
&gt; camp and they specifically had a L40+ bard to sing this song <br/>
&gt; to prevent <br/>
&gt; members from being charmed.<br/>
&gt; I tried Disenchant last night after a group member was rez&#39;ed <br/>
&gt; and it did not <br/>
&gt; dispell the Rez effect. It was effecting my whole party but <br/>
&gt; no one reported <br/>
&gt; losing any buffs.<br/>
&gt; Is it possible the Disenchanting song and the Antimagic song <br/>
&gt; effects have <br/>
&gt; been completely switched in the multitude of patches and <br/>
&gt; tweaks/nerfs since <br/>
&gt; beta?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just wondering out Loud,<br/>
