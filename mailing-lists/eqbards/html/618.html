<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979566571">Oh, another borderline exploit tactic with Bellow is kiting.<br/>
You know how druids can cast Spirit of the Wolf on themselves,<br/>
then Stinging Swarm (damage over time) on a monster, then just<br/>
run to stay out of melee range?  Bards can do the same thing<br/>
(though it&#39;s less effective and more work) with Accelerando<br/>
and Bellow.  I won&#39;t go into details (pretty easy to figure<br/>
out) since I try to avoid doing this.  I may start off a fight<br/>
using this tactic to soften up a monster (in that respect I<br/>
see it as similar to the root spell), or if I&#39;m fetching (so<br/>
other groups don&#39;t steal the monster), but I&#39;ve never mostly-<br/>
killed a monster doing this.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve almost killed a monster but you are almost dead as<br/>
well, you can play both Restoration and Accelerando and run<br/>
away.  You&#39;ll be healing while you run, and after you think<br/>
you&#39;ve got enough health back to finish the monster, turn and<br/>
finish the fight.  Just make sure you run before you drop<br/>
below 33% health (that&#39;s when you start to run slower), and be<br/>
careful you don&#39;t pick up any more monsters while you&#39;re<br/>
running.  :-)  And it helps if you switch to a drum or lute<br/>
before you run.  (Does everyone on this list know about<br/>
setting up inventory slots in your macros, so you can switch<br/>
weapons/instruments without having to open your inventory?)<br/>
