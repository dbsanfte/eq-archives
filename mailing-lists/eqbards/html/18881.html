&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Finally.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Got level 49 more than two weeks ago.  Could only play on weekends.<br/>
&gt; Some recent highlights:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  Died 7 times in Plane of Hate.  My cleric never quite got just how<br/>
&gt; few Hit Points I have.<br/>
&gt; 2.  Died 3 times to bad trains in Lower Guk.<br/>
&gt; 3.  Died once in Sebelis.  Five frog pull, four frogs decided that, of<br/>
&gt; 24 people there, I was the tastiest.  Never died so fast in my playing<br/>
&gt; career.  The red just plummeted straight down to nothing, without<br/>
&gt; stopping once.<br/>
&gt; 4.  Died three times in City of Mist, including once when I <br/>
&gt; had managed<br/>
&gt; to fall asleep.  Hey, sometimes people just take too darn long to get<br/>
&gt; organized, you know?<br/>
&gt; 5.  Died to another bad train in Lower Guk.<br/>
&gt; 6.  Died in Skyfire, just a big pile of bad guys all at once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm.  16 deaths in one level.  How embarrassing is that?  Curiously, I<br/>
&gt; never got negative experience for a day.  Thank goodness for level 49<br/>
&gt; rezzes.  Just didn&#39;t get much positive experience.  Hehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But!  (And yes, it&#39;s anti-climactic for many of you, but tough), I got<br/>
&gt; level 50!  Giants in Burning Woods finally did the trick.  :)<br/>
