&gt;I think the problem is that most of us have already re-evaluated our<br/>
&gt;playlists and determined that in 95% off all balanced groups, the most<br/>
&gt;effective thing you can do is be a mana/hp battery. The Cantana/Nivs/Mana<br/>
&gt;song combo is so powerful, it&#39;s almost always the &quot;best&quot; thing you can do.<br/>
&gt;Unfortunetly we are all too used to being effective in a variety of ways,<br/>
&gt;not just one way. Even if you melee while singing the &quot;battery&quot; songs, you<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t scratching the mobs. Test it, fight a certain number of fights<br/>
&gt;meleeing and not meleeing. You&#39;ll percieve absolutely no difference in<br/>
&gt;outcomes. So You might as well just turn on your gamepad macro and go watch<br/>
&gt;a movie.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, the outcome in 99.9% of the fights is the same, i (and my group) win.  for<br/>
a while last night our monk was linkdead.  we continued fighting.  the outcome was<br/>
the same every time (we won).  does that mean that monk melee is meaningless?<br/>
and what about the 90% of the population who don&#39;t get to 55 and don&#39;t get cantana?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>totally untrue.  i was in karnors last night and pulling skeletal berserkers and<br/>
curates and sentries of sathir and the ever present dogs.  group was wiz, me,<br/>
warrior, warrior, warrior, monk.  we did non stop pulls.  got singles or doubles<br/>
every time (i was doing the pulling since it&#39;s more considerate to lament the<br/>
mobs on the way back than feigning them onto the other group fighting while<br/>
feign splitting).<br/>

&gt;people don&#39;t have the right to tell them that the rules they have made for<br/>
&gt;the bard class squeeze the fun out of it at higher levels.<br/>
