Some of the guys play female characters for the purposes of fun<br/>
roleplaying.  It&#39;s not like we think that you park yourself in the corner<br/>
just so to emote<br/>
<br/>
/em oggles herself<br/>
/em pinches herself<br/>
/em stares at herself<br/>
<br/>
=).  Speaking of which, I have a friend woodelf ranger who has the best<br/>
character description that goes along the lines of :<br/>
<br/>
If you are reading this would you please get your hands of my legs and<br/>
your head of my breastplate because I am pulling my claw out right now.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I complied the first time I found myself with my hands on her<br/>
legs and my head on her breastplate.  Suffice to say the next part wasn&#39;t<br/>
pretty and I found myself cowering behind a counter for my dear life.<br/>
<br/>
Treilanin Loreweaver (male woodelf bard)<br/>
Aariel (female High Elf Mage)<br/>
And I play a female woodelf bard elsewhere.<br/>

&gt; I wonder if any of the guys trying to catch a good look at a<br/>
&gt; scantily dressed EQ female have figured out yet that if they<br/>
&gt; *play* a scantily dressed EQ female, they can stare at<br/>
&gt; themselves for as long as they like and nobody will care.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not that that had anything to do with my bard being female...<br/>
&gt; :-)<br/>
