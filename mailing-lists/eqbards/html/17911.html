<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002991776">Ok,<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve camped and I&#39;ve camped and I have yet to be rewarded for my efforts<br/>
with even a single fang. I have however gained a few levels (both here in<br/>
sunny Mistmore and elsewhere) and I&#39;ve noticed that the maid butler camp has<br/>
a relatively low amount of spawns, especially when trying to support 5 level<br/>
37 players.<br/>
<br/>
Sooooooo...<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my question to all of you more experienced bards: What level can I<br/>
expect to have a reasonable shot at soloing the maid butler area? I&#39;d be<br/>
quite content to just do the maid and butler room, and leave the hall and<br/>
kitchen alone.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
