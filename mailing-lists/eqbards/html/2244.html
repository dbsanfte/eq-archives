through it, Karana has griffins flying through it.  There&#39;s<br/>
one at Lavastorm, which is a bit safer but nearly impossible<br/>
to find.  The Lavastorm camp is also the only one with the<br/>
blunt combine weapons and the combine spear and rapier.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never been to the camp in Rathe Lake.<br/>
<br/>
Most bards tend to get the best prices or close to it, so I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t fret so much over the cost.  When you outgrow it, you<br/>
can either sell it to a player, or sell it to a merchant and<br/>
only take a 10%-15% loss.  So even though a combine rapier<br/>
cost me 52.5pp, I can sell it back for 47.681pp, thus it&#39;s<br/>
like I&#39;ve only paid 5pp to use it.<br/>
