Is that so obvious that it&#39;s assumed?<br/>

Related topic:<br/>
I&#39;ve been in a lot of groups lately that seem to believe that drops should go to <br/>
the player who can best utilize them, with lottos if there is some dispute over <br/>
who would reap the most benefit.  Not so curiously, they rarely seem to believe <br/>
that a Bard can reap the most benefit from anything.  They&#39;re correct, of <br/>
course.  Still, while the concept of giving items to the person who can best <br/>
utilize them may be fine in a single-player RPG (where an individual is trying to <br/>
maximize the performance of his &quot;team&quot;), it makes no sense to me in EQ.  If these <br/>
were players that I intended to play with day in and day out for the next several <br/>
months, I might buy it, but I don&#39;t buy it when these are players I may never <br/>
group with again.  What possible advantage is it to ME to maximize THEIR <br/>
utility?  If it&#39;s an item I can use, if it&#39;s better than what I have, and if I <br/>
fought for it, I really don&#39;t get why I shouldn&#39;t be in a lottery for it.<br/>
<br/>
I do like what Shada&#39;s guild does for the Planes and Dragons (I&#39;m not high enough <br/>
to be fighting them), though.  It seems like a nice way to make sure that people <br/>
don&#39;t get overly lucky or overly unlucky when it comes to special/rare drops.<br/>
