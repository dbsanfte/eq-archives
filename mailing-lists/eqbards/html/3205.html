<div id="ygrps-yiv-793756330">Well Treilanin&#39;s bio has changed since I first wrote it, but my current<br/>
bio basically follows this.  During the Crushbone Orc&#39;s first foray into<br/>
the forest of Greater Faydar Trei&#39;s love Aariel was kidnapped from him.<br/>
So, he was left to search for her (she  was not a slave in CB) all across<br/>
Antonica.  With seething hatred Trei exact his bitter revenge upon all<br/>
orcs that cross his path as he searches for Aariel.<br/>
<br/>
Now many things have changed since then that have changed what Trei is<br/>
doing, but I have yet to get around to updating the bio so it reflects his<br/>
current state.  Besides there isn&#39;t enough room to write out everything<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
BTW how many actually read the bios when they inspect people?  I<br/>
personally read the bios when I inspect unless the person really wants me<br/>
to drool over an item they are wearing.<br/>
