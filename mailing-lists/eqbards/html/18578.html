<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832834361"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; someone to remove himself from the guild last night, though, because he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was clearly courting the #1 guild<br/>
<br/>
  I am still new to EQ and Innoruuk as a whole so I have to ask...  What<br/>
guilds are considered the biggest?  Because I play during the servers<br/>
off-peak hours (Aussie time) I tend to see a lot of guilds with only one or<br/>
two members in them.  But with about 500 players on at the time there&#39;s not<br/>
much to represent :)<br/>
<br/>
  I am not asking because I want to be part of a &quot;big&quot; guild but just<br/>
curious.  I don&#39;t want to give anyone the wrong impression :)  Besides my<br/>
little one is already questing to join the guild most suited for her - size<br/>
or not!<br/>
<br/>
