<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106054578">No one under 40 should go against the lord, and really should all be 45 to<br/>
50.  the only way 6 ppl can do it is with one tank, 2 clerics, a wizard,<br/>
another tank or bard, plus an ENCHANTER.  the enchanter has to mes the 2<br/>
boks so you can concentrate on the lord.  the lord is level 47 or 48, but<br/>
has about 10000hp and TWO Harm Touches about 480dmg each, and double attacks<br/>
for 112+.  so if you have no enchanter, you need about 12 people.  The 2<br/>
cleric rule is so one can constantly rotate their 3 or 4 stun spells on him,<br/>
while the other heals.  The only way to pull singly is a level 50 monk who<br/>
knows how to pull using feign death.  Only tried that once but it worked.<br/>
Otherwise, need around 12 ppl or 6 or more plus enchanter, preferrably all<br/>
level 45 to 50.<br/>

&gt; Michael (or anyone else),<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Ok, need some advice on the Ghoul Lord.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Our Guild, pretty much nightly, has 6 people levels 35-49 <br/>
&gt; head down and<br/>
&gt; clear the whole area UP TO The Ghoul Lord. By the time we <br/>
&gt; reach him, all<br/>
&gt; that is left is 2 Bok Knights, The Ghoul Lord, and his pet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Just HOW TOUGH is the Ghoul Lord? Is there another critter he can be<br/>
&gt; equally compared to? How about the Bok Knights? Any <br/>
&gt; suggestions? Can the<br/>
&gt; Boks be pulled singly?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Thanks for any input,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
