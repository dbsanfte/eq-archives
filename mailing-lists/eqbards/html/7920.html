&gt; Excellent!  This is good news indeed.  As far as &quot;bard&quot; quests go, we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; really getting screwed.  In fact, I was under the impression that there<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be any bard quests at the new temple.  This snippet has brightened<br/>
&gt; by day for sure.  However, if they are anything like the few quests we<br/>
&gt; already have, they probably won&#39;t be worth doing (IMO).<br/>
<br/>

something.<br/>
