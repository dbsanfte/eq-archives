<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958417120">When I frist got sonorous clouding I read that it sometimes affected<br/>
undead, and I think there was a debate over this on this newsgroup.<br/>
Today, I was in unrest and I can confirm that Sonorous Clouding DID make<br/>
me invisible to Undead, at level 33.<br/>
<br/>
I entered the house of unrest and turned to the left and saw a ghoul and<br/>
a Lurking mummy. I /considered them, and they both &quot;scowled at me ready<br/>
to attack&quot; I know that normal ghouls no longer attack me at 33, not sure<br/>
about the lurking mummies. Mummies and zombies in the desert still<br/>
attack me as do skeletons and dry/ice boned skels.<br/>
<br/>
I started Sonorous Clouding and considered them again. The mummy was now<br/>
indifferent to me, the ghoul to my suprise, still scowled. I walked up<br/>
to them, and they did not react.<br/>
<br/>
Then I entered the next room, where there were Dark boned skeletons and<br/>
dry boned skeletons. They were all indifferent to me, and did not<br/>
attack, even when I poked one.<br/>
<br/>
I went lower in unrest, into the pit where Hags, and Dusty werebats are<br/>
and they were blue to me, but they were all indifferent and did not<br/>
attack. Got the scare of my life while standing in the pit next to the<br/>
hag in the center when she said something like &quot;you beliefs and personal<br/>
actions are an affront to me!&quot; and attacked someone who had entered the<br/>
room behind me.<br/>
<br/>
So, in this way, our song is supperior to both invisbility and invis to<br/>
undead, as it seems to affect them both. Occasionaly on my travels thru<br/>
unrest I saw an undead that scowled at me, but they never acted like<br/>
they saw me.<br/>
<br/>
I got attacked ONCE. I was standing in a room, I noticed the room was<br/>
completly empty, and them poof, in drops a dark boned skel (green to me,<br/>
no xp). It attacked immediatly and I killed it. My invis did not fail<br/>
before he attacked. thought this might help to try to find the<br/>
mysterious level at which SC affects undead.<br/>
