<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361472733">My friends and I have always assumed that there is a large random component <br/>
involved in how much experience you lose when you croak.  Within a single level, <br/>
the variability seems to be as much as 400%.  I do think that you lose <br/>
significantly more in Hell Level + 1, and you APPEAR to lose significantly less <br/>
in Hell Levels, but each bubble requires much more exp than the preceding (or <br/>
succeeding) levels there, and I think the net exp loss is about the same as a <br/>
normal level.  It would not be unlike Verant to &quot;play dice with the universe&quot;, <br/>
considering that the amount of lost exp that is restored by Cleric spells is <br/>
random within a set of defined parameters (e.g., 0-25%, 0-75%).<br/>

&gt; &gt;       I get a chuckle with people trying to come up with elaborate theories<br/>
&gt; &gt; relating to the experience loss on death.  We all forget Occum&#39;s Razor (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; simplest explanation is probably the correct one).  Sounds to me that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; completely random...<br/>
