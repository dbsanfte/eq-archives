<div id="ygrps-yiv-532889514">Actually, since the pause value is in tenths of a second (ie. that&#39;s why you <br/>
have to pause 30 for a 3 second cast/sing time), it&#39;s really not that much <br/>
added time.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks Olgwinn :), I suspected timing was the issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My question then is, if so much pause needs to be added to the macros to <br/>
&gt;make them work, is it actualy faster to use the separate commands?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I thought of adding pauses into my attack macro, I thought well, it <br/>
&gt;seems faster to have the separate attack key.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know there is the advantage of fewer keys to mash, but in a situation <br/>
&gt;where a mob is beating on you or your party member, speed is of the <br/>
&gt;essence.<br/>
