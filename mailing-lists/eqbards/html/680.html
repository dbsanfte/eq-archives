&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From discussions on other lists, and my own experiences, I have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>discovered<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the following things:<br/>
&gt; 1) Bard songs will cause creatures to see through invisibility, sometimes<br/>
&gt; even cancel it.<br/>
&gt; 2) Bard songs will bring someone out of hiding if they are in your group.<br/>
&gt; 3) Bard songs can break root and whirl spells - even if you aren&#39;t using<br/>
&gt; offensive ones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In other words - Bard songs are major conflictors with other spell effects<br/>
&gt; in the game.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can confirm this one. Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side Effects&quot; at<br/>
times.<br/>
Some of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>
<br/>
Invisibility - Having it cast on you while you are already playing a song<br/>
makes you SEEM<br/>
                   to be invisible. However, song effects are still visible<br/>
to both PCs and monsters.<br/>
                   I recently saw an &quot;invisible&quot; bard playing Hymn of<br/>
Restoration attempt to walk thru<br/>
                   an Orc Legionaire encampment. The walk back to recover<br/>
his corpse was much<br/>
                   longer than the walk through the camp. Everything in the<br/>
camp attacked him the<br/>
                   instant he walked in. He remained invisible thru the<br/>
moment when he switched songs<br/>
                   to attempt the Accelerando to escape.<br/>
<br/>
Root - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that generate<br/>
the &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>
            have no effect on you. However I DID manage to get a cumulative<br/>
effect from SoW in<br/>
            a situation where I was low on stamina and already playing the<br/>
Accelerando. SoW sped<br/>
            me to aproximately the speed I would have were I not low on<br/>
stamina and still playing the<br/>
           Accelerando.<br/>
<br/>
Swimming - While playing the Accelerando and swimming you do not lose<br/>
stamina and do appear<br/>
                      to actually swim faster. For a laugh, equip your drum<br/>
and play the Accelerando while<br/>
                     swimming. The animation with the drum is a standing<br/>
one, and is played even when<br/>
                     swimming, so that you can appear to actually &quot;Walk on<br/>
Water&quot; #)<br/>
<br/>
Encumbered - If you are playing any of the strength enhancing songs, be<br/>
careful that you pay attention<br/>
                         to your NORMAL encumbrance level as well as the one<br/>
you have with the song. If you can<br/>
                         carry 80 without the song, and 90 with the song,<br/>
you don&#39;t want to be carrying 85 lbs of<br/>
                         equipment and have to flee from a combat since, if<br/>
you are stunned or you switch to the<br/>
                         Accelerando to escape you instantly become<br/>
encumbered and may no longer be able to<br/>
                         run away, even with the Accelerando playing.<br/>
<br/>
Chasing - If you have that monster nearly killed and can&#39;t quite catch him<br/>
to kill him, occasionally Kelin&#39;s<br/>
                  Lugubrious Lament will cause a fleeing monster to stop.<br/>
This only works until you actually hit<br/>
                  the creature, and it will not work on a monster that has<br/>
ceased to flee and has turned to charge<br/>
                  you again.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Using an instrument in lieu of a weapon in combat at later levels is like,<br/>
&gt; well, cutting off your hand.  There&#39;s times when it&#39;s useful, but for the<br/>
&gt; most part, you&#39;re better off taking advantage of the fact that you hit<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I have found at least ONE circumstance where playing an instrument<br/>
in combat is more useful than using a weapon.<br/>
<br/>
TRAIN CONTROL<br/>
<br/>
When a hoarde of monsters has been dragged into an area by some poor fool,<br/>
playing an area effect damage song with its accompanying instrument while<br/>
having a couple of allies run interference for you can be a good way to<br/>
eliminate a train that would otherwise be difficult to slay.<br/>
While your allies block some of the monsters direct attention on you, you<br/>
can damage the entire train. Once the train has taken significant damage<br/>
it&#39;s time to switch to a weapon and begin to pick them off one by one. At<br/>
the very least this method can keep a large number of fleeing<br/>
people from getting killed. If you are in a narrow spot and EVERYTHING is<br/>
mad at you, only SOME of them can get to you, giving others a chance to<br/>
escape. I recently did this in BlackBurrow and then when everyone had fled,<br/>
Jumped and hopped my way across the shoulders of more than 20 gnolls in<br/>
order to escape. I wish I&#39;d gotten a screenshot of that one. #(</div>
