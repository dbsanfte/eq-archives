<div id="ygrps-yiv-40268129">I&#39;m gonna disagree here.  Ok, symbols cost 3 things, 1, they cost coins,<br/>
everyone can clearly see this.  Second, they cost mana.  Third, they<br/>
cost time.  Sometimes you group 3 with 2, but if you do, make sure you<br/>
realize how much mana all these buffs really cost.  A cleric casting<br/>
guard and valor and symbol on 6 people is going to be spending a LOT<br/>
of time just rebuffing people.  This is going to make the going <br/>
really slow.  <br/>
<br/>
The scenario you list here, has 2 problems before you can think that<br/>
a symbol would help.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Shouldn&#39;t be pulling when the room spawns.  That&#39;s just bad<br/>
playing.  Rooms spawn at set times, which can easily be figured out.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Evac&#39;er shouldn&#39;t die like this, even if it means they preform<br/>
a little less optimally than they can.  Instead of having the cleric<br/>
full buff everyone in the party and make sure everyone is fully,<br/>
healed before any pull, just let the evac&#39;er sit back<br/>
and ride it easy, using mana safely, never draw the attention of monsters,<br/>
always ready to evac.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably see better experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That said, yes everyone should be fully buffed when you go take something<br/>
dangerous.   But rarely are you trying to get xp and do something<br/>
dangerous at the same time :)<br/>

&gt; &quot;ok, inc&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;crap you pulled 2&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;damn 3!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;room spawn!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;evac! evac!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;cant - onikage just died!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;LOC!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with the last thing you said 100% - everyone should get the best<br/>
&gt; buffs available.  If I join groups with pick-up players - first thing I do<br/>
&gt; (after asking if everyone has /assist hot-keyed) is hand the cleric 5pp and<br/>
&gt; tell him to let me know when my buff bill runs out.  In my old reg group, we<br/>
&gt; made damn sure the cleric never worried about symbol buffs costing too much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;how much plat you got in bank?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;about 800pp&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;here&#39;s 2k let me know when you run low&quot;<br/>

&gt; 		&gt; Bah!  Not worthy?? BAH!<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; This reminds me of some clerics who say &quot;...only the tanks<br/>
&gt; get symbol<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; buffs...&quot; Now what kinda logic is that?  Your casters have<br/>
&gt; the lowest<br/>
&gt; 		hp/ac<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; and so who do you decide to help first?  The ones with the<br/>
&gt; most hp/ac???<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; Pretty dumb is you ask me<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		No, not dumb at all.  Casters are the last ones who should<br/>
&gt; get HP buffs.<br/>
&gt; 		Casters should do their best to avoid taking damage.  Let<br/>
&gt; the tanks tank.<br/>
&gt; 		If the group is doing good, the monsters will never lay a<br/>
&gt; hand on the<br/>
&gt; 		caster.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Symbol takes a reagent.  The cost is 5gp up to 12pp for the<br/>
&gt; higher level<br/>
&gt; 		buffs.  Buffing casters, who shouldn&#39;t be taking damage, is<br/>
&gt; a serious drain<br/>
&gt; 		on a Cleric&#39;s resources.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		At higher levels with Complete Heal, having a Symbol on a<br/>
&gt; tank is even more<br/>
&gt; 		effective.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		The only thing dumb is saying always/never.  If you are<br/>
&gt; trying to break a<br/>
&gt; 		spawn, or going through a dangerous area, then giving all<br/>
&gt; members a Symbol<br/>
&gt; 		is a good idea.  Having a safety margin &quot;just in case&quot; is<br/>
&gt; fine if you got<br/>
&gt; 		the mana and gems to spare.<br/>
