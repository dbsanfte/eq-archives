<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093395977">What skill level does bard tracking stop? I hit 35 and went to my guild and<br/>
slapped 5 of my many unused points into it. Taking it up to 40, I haven&#39;t<br/>
seen it go up anymore so I&#39;m assuming this is it??<br/>
<br/>
I tracked Phinigel Atropus in Kedge today, anyone seen this thing and what<br/>
does it look like?<br/>
