&gt; This is the kind of thing you would expect Verant to discover before they<br/>
&gt; implemented the quests.  I fail to see how lack of paying attention to<br/>

This was just more obvious than most.  As soon as I heard there was an exploit involving this<br/>

before it went to live servers.  :(<br/>
