<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-718522479">I disagree to the extent that casual gamers cannot ever participate in any<br/>
substantial way in dynamic events because if they create one that is for<br/>
lower levels a 50th level character can just waltz in and completely take<br/>
over the event.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not talking about rare spawns and time spent camping here.  I was<br/>
totally unable to do much of anything in any of the events I was lucky<br/>
enough to be present at.  Even though the npcs that were to be fought were<br/>
white or yellow to me and my group in some cases, they were just being nuked<br/>
by level 40+&#39;s so there was no point in actually trying to attack them.  The<br/>
few we did engage would get blasted to smithereens by <br/>
someone long before our group of four could ever bring it below half.<br/>
<br/>
My complaint is those people who spend more time on the game don&#39;t get more<br/>
enjoyment out of dynamic events, they get all of it.  Might as well hold all<br/>
of them on the planes from now on far as I can see.  We&#39;re not talking about<br/>
levels or items here, we&#39;re talking about being allowed to actually<br/>
participate.<br/>

there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  do you disagree with the statement that<br/>
if you spend more time in the game you should have better items and attain<br/>
higher levels?  True casual gamers aren&#39;t concerned that much with items<br/>
and levels.  the only people upset by this statement are the power gamers<br/>
who don&#39;t have time to put into the game.</div>
