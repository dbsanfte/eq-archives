&gt; They can last several minutes.<br/>

think of the last time I&#39;ve grouped with an enchanter who actually charmed<br/>
something.  The beating they take when it breaks is enuf to scare them off<br/>
the spell.<br/>

&gt; There is no &quot;combat round&quot; per se.  A tick is 6 seconds.  A<br/>
&gt; &quot;combat round&quot; depends on the speeds of your weapons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always thought of the 3 second pulse of our songs as a &quot;tick&quot;... as in<br/>
&quot;Denon&#39;s DOT does 25 pts a tick with a 3 tick duration.&quot;<br/>
