in a while.<br/>

Talies, sorry to see you going, but glad you&#39;re going to stay here with us.<br/>
I have been very burned out on EQ lately.  I haven&#39;t logged Elfson since<br/>
killing Vox on Thursday, and I know I won&#39;t touch him till at least next<br/>
Tuesday.  (This week is packed in RL).<br/>
<br/>
I told my regular Thursday group (where I am the cleric) that I may be<br/>
cancelling my account also.  Similar thinking to what Talies wrote about,<br/>
I&#39;m just tired of being treated poorly.  Add to that BG2 (which I have<br/>
barely touched), Playstation2&#39;s imminent release, it being both hockey and<br/>
football season, and my theatrical hobby becoming more time consuming, it&#39;s<br/>
starting to seem not worth my $10 a month...<br/>
<br/>
At least for a time (if I cancel) I will stay here too (stifle those<br/>
groans!), when Anrachy Online or whatever comes out next I will want to see<br/>
who is heading there.</div>
