&gt;&gt;  Anyone else jacked up about the plane of FEAR opening tomorrow?  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; for one am going in there naked with a drum and a minotaur horn... scout<br/>
&gt;&gt; around a little!  Fear would be entered through Oasis I presume.  O how the<br/>
&gt;&gt; spectres will be running around the beach tomorrow I have a feeling!<br/>

&gt;Actually the Plane of Fear is entered behind the Spectre Cave in the Feerott.<br/>
&gt;Guarded by a pushover L40 Necromancer named Cyndreela...HUGE orange gate cant<br/>
&gt;miss it =)<br/>

Why does everybody think the spectre tower in oasis is a gate pt? Only<br/>
thing up in the tower is a pentagram with a flame shooting up, would be the<br/>
wierdest zone pt in the game then. Unless i am missing something anyways.<br/>
