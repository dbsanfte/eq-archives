<div id="ygrps-yiv-834637302">I had this happen to me doing corpse recovery.  From what I could gather it<br/>
caused several casualties among surprised players while I was there.  Best<br/>
we could figure, the original train to the zone included a mob or more that<br/>
could cast see invis.  As these mobs filed back from the zone they were<br/>
apparently casting see invis on the usual &#39;pit&#39; mobs.<br/>

Had a couple of comments on this.  First of all - I don&#39;t think lag had<br/>
anything to do with it  Except when the server or routers are lagging - I&#39;m<br/>
lucky enough to have 784K DSL so I rarely have lag.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the &quot;and&quot; it should be an &quot;or&quot;.  I&#39;ve gotten attacked by these<br/>
mobs when I had Sonorous Clouding on me - and I&#39;ve been attacked when I&#39;ve<br/>
had Camouflage.  I never sing Clouding when others have Cam or vice versa -<br/>
I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about and have been super careful.<br/>
 Also - this has happened to me while I wasn&#39;t grouped- or the rest of the<br/>
group wasn&#39;t around.<br/>
<br/>
A possible theory I&#39;ve heard so far (also mentioned by someone here) is that<br/>
there are mobs that cast see invoice on others.  I wouldn&#39;t even be<br/>
surprised with the pathing bugs if they are casting from a distance.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the mobs around the lake - I think they are different.  I ran past<br/>
them and didn&#39;t get attacked - but the ones in the passageway to the<br/>
graveyard - and the cave always seem to.  As far as the castle mobs - when I<br/>
was lower and hunted by the lake - I rarely if ever was attacked by<br/>
them -unless someone attacked one of them...<br/>
<br/>
While the cast see invoice theory may be the answer - I&#39;ve been attacked so<br/>
many times trying to get to and from the graveyard/cave area - I believe<br/>
that Verant added See Invoice to some of those mobs...<br/>

&gt; &gt;     Starting a couple weeks ago - they would go agro on me when singing<br/>
&gt; &gt; Clouding and when Regular (not Superior) Camouflage is cast on me.  This<br/>

&gt; Could you clarify your &quot;and&quot; in that statement?  If you sing<br/>
&gt; Clouding while anyone in your group is camoed or invised, they<br/>
&gt; are visible (not to you but to the mobs) every time your song<br/>
&gt; pulses.  This is pretty easy to demonstrate - have a group<br/>
&gt; member cast invis on you while you are singing clouding.<br/>
&gt; Target a far-away mob and /con it repeatedly.  Every time your<br/>
&gt; song pulses, it can see you and the /con message will change.<br/>
