&gt; I have a question for y&#39;all.  I know some bards are huge fans of Siren&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Song (aka &quot;Charm&quot;).  For me, however, it just doesn&#39;t match the power of<br/>
&gt; Fear + Chains.  The problem with Charm, IMO, is the fact that you have to<br/>
&gt; find two equal opponents within close proximity of each other.  Even if<br/>

attacks a mob.  So you can charm a green mob, send it after a<br/>
mob, when your pet gets killed charm another green mob and<br/>
send it after the mob, repeat until you can melee the mob.<br/>

If the mob you charmed wins, great.  If the other mob is going<br/>
to win, you can usually tell because the mob you charmed will<br/>
get close to death.  Once it&#39;s close, to where a couple rounds<br/>
should end the battle, you charm the other mob.  The first mob<br/>
will be hitting you, but the winning mob should finish it<br/>
while charmed thus getting you the kill.  If you don&#39;t want to<br/>
be hit, you can play the riskier game of Chaining the losing<br/>
mob, then charming the winning mob.  That&#39;ll slow down the<br/>
loser (who will be chasing you due to having been charmed) to<br/>
where the winner can catch up and finish it off.<br/>

a certain distance for you to give it commands.  That&#39;s why<br/>
you hear horror stories about magicians&#39; pets causing trains<br/>
in dungeons.  Once a pet chases a mob out of command range,<br/>
there&#39;s nothing a magician can do to bring it back.<br/>
