&gt; Trust me, its not just Xegony- I was thinking the same thing <br/>
&gt; on Bertoxx. I<br/>
&gt; have never been harassed as much as I have in the last couple <br/>
&gt; of months. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t mind answering questions- that I will always do, but I <br/>
&gt; have never<br/>
&gt; asked someone to give me money or equipment for no reason- <br/>
&gt; that constitutes<br/>
&gt; whining :)-and i just hit &quot;ignore&quot;. Sad, really, because I <br/>
&gt; love to surprise<br/>
&gt; newbies by giving them some money or an item -I especially <br/>
&gt; like the little<br/>
&gt; guys who buff me and ask for nothing- I realize they are <br/>
&gt; practising, but<br/>
&gt; when they ask for or expect nothing in return, that&#39;s when <br/>
&gt; being a nice guy<br/>
&gt; kinda makes you feel good- but now I try to avoid the big  cities.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll back up Scanna and say that it&#39;s been the last few weeks on Bertox<br/>
where I&#39;m getting at least a beg almost each session. I don&#39;t even need to<br/>
be near a city. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Last night someone shouted to &quot;help find corpse&quot;. By the time I got there, a<br/>
level 5 bard had lead him to his corpse. I didn&#39;t have much on me, but as I<br/>
was happy to see a low level bard helping others, I gave the kind-hearted<br/>
bard the 5 pp I had on me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve ignored the last 2 &quot;begs&quot; that I&#39;ve gotten, but reading other people&#39;s<br/>
posts, I&#39;ll reply to them and see if I can encourage them to earn their way.<br/>
I doubt it&#39;ll sway them, but I figure if they never get anything, they&#39;ll<br/>
eventually stop begging or quit.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I started a newbie cleric so I can play with my wife who just started<br/>
playing. I&#39;m a human male and she&#39;s a female half-elf ranger. We&#39;re just<br/>
standing there at a vendor when a level 50 monk gives her a bunch of leather<br/>
armor and a silvery war axe. This just reconfirms my past experiences where<br/>
female characters get a lot more freebies than male characters. =P<br/>
