<br/>
Still don&#39;t recall this thing being there before, can&#39;t imagine I missed a<br/>
giant spinning ball floating over my head. *boggle*<br/>
<br/>
I would have thought it would have made some kind of splash on the general<br/>
message boards, but I have not heard a peep.<br/>

I was referring to the Portal to Plane of Mischief - not the portal to<br/>
Sleeper&#39;s Tomb (which evidently is what that portal is...)<br/>

LOL!  Unless it was built entirely out of particles and I had them turned<br/>
off I am 100% certain it was not there when I fought giants from the foot of<br/>
the thing for 2 days.<br/>

Per Absor&#39;s latest comment - Verant claims its never been missing - just<br/>
none of the 350,000 active subscribers have figured out how to get in...<br/>

Perhaps it&#39;s the portal to the Plane of Mischief that&#39;s been missing,<br/>
presumed non-existant for a while?<br/>

Ok, not entirely a bard topic, but as collectors of information I figured<br/>
someone here would know.  Where does this portal go to and what is the key?<br/>
Also, I sure don&#39;t recall seeing this portal here when I was fighting there<br/>
a couple of weeks ago; and how the heck could I have missed that giant<br/>
spinning ball???  When did this get added?<br/>
