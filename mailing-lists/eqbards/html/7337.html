 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s capped at 40 from the start, and you don&#39;t really need to<br/>
practice it as long as you&#39;re running across terrain where you<br/>
used to take moderate damage (Ro, Oasis, parts of<br/>
Butcherblock, etc).  You&#39;ll gain the skill naturally just<br/>
running around these zones.  You do not have to take damage to<br/>
gain skill.<br/>
<br/>
I still think this cap needs to be raised at higher levels.<br/>
Oasis and North Ro can be deadly to me now if I try to run in<br/>
a straight line across the desert.<br/>
