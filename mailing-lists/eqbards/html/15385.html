<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710962403">THis all depends on your finances, not really your level.  If you are an<br/>
untwinked lvl 12, you probaly  don&#39;t have much money.  THat was the lvl<br/>
where I started to really make money (dervishes!), until then I was<br/>
struggling to buy my songs...<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to spend much for a weapon, look for a tentacle whip,<br/>
its magical and sells for like 5P.  Also look at a fine steel spear for<br/>
a cheap peircer (again should only cost like 5-10P).  For my blunt<br/>
weapon I was given a dwarven mace, no idea what they normally run for<br/>
(its the easy part of the screaming mace quest).  I have used those<br/>
weapons since lvl 5 (I saved aup all those bat and bone stacks till I<br/>
got a premium for them, and had about 25P when i was lvl 5).  At lvl 20<br/>
they are really showing their age now, and I&#39;m hoping to upgrade, but it<br/>
will cost about 300P to get to the next level of weapons...<br/>
