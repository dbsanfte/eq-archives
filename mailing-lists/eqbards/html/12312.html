<div id="ygrps-yiv-750484236">I&#39;ve had it both ways. The problem is when you get to a higher level exp<br/>
moves in jumps more then a pixel at a time. So if your almost to a jump it<br/>
will look like you lose less. If you just jumped it will look like you lost<br/>
a lot.<br/>

&gt;I made 30th level over the holidays and since then have died twice.  The<br/>
&gt;first time I died was in the assasin room in lower guk.  I got killed by an<br/>
&gt;one of the undead ghoul wizards (conned red to me). I noticed that the<br/>
&gt;amount of experience on the bar didn&#39;t visually drop very much.  Second<br/>

&gt;hell level.  Subjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty for<br/>
&gt;dying is higher when something kills you that cons green/blue to you versus<br/>
&gt;something killing you that cons yellow/red.  Anyone else had similar<br/>
&gt;results?<br/>
