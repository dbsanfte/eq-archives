time.  Thus if your left and right hand weapons are<br/>
equivalent, you will be doing 10% more damage.<br/>
<br/>
The difference in damage ratio between a combine longsword and<br/>
a well balanced longsword is about 10%.  Most people would<br/>
agree the level spread on these two weapons is about 10<br/>
levels.  The difference in damage ratio between a combine<br/>
longsword and a crystalline sword (which I&#39;m guessing is a<br/>
mid-30s weapon) is only 35%.  By the time you get there, your<br/>
dual wield should be going off about 35%.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the game is designed so small amounts of additional<br/>
damage make a large difference in overall combat.  10% may not<br/>
seem like much, but it makes a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the biggest factor in ditching the shiny brass shield<br/>
was that the damn thing weighed 10 pounds.<br/>

comes from the same monsters who hold the troll hide belt,<br/>
so they obviously aren&#39;t friendly with the evil races.<br/>
