up grouped with a bard who was helpful but far from skillful.  I ended up<br/>
making a lot of suggestions, telling him they were based on observations of<br/>
other bards at work.  I didn&#39;t tell him one of the other bards was me.<br/>
<br/>
I also didn&#39;t tell him the person behind the cute little female he was flirting<br/>
with was a 51 year old grandfather.<br/>
<br/>
He did say that he was 16.  That explained a lot.<br/>
