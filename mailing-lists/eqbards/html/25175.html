<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907057149">I&#39;ve always wondered about what is truly the most effective damage output.<br/>
Obviously what weapon you use is a major factor.  I do find that when I&#39;m in<br/>
a caster heavy group - its good to melee just to keep the mob parked and<br/>
aggroed if possible.  I &quot;only&quot; have a Nestrolo Tambo and have had decent<br/>
ratio weaps for some time (esp since Sunday with my new Guardians Mace) -<br/>
but when I was using a Blood Runed Short Sword (9/18) and a Sioniches<br/>
Partisan (9/19) Tried both weaps and chants in The Hole and the party &quot;felt&quot;<br/>
that I did more damage with the weapons.  Also this was at level 54 - and<br/>
I&#39;m sure that is a major factor on chant damage output as well...<br/>
<br/>
This was FAR from scientific - but was kind of interesting none-the-less.<br/>

Wow!  You remember that far back!  Well, eventually I decided that bards<br/>
pretty much suck using swords so I try to play my bard with instruments as<br/>
much as possible.  Granted, having a Selo&#39;s drum and the 3 chants does<br/>
affect your perspective on what  is the best way to apply damage. And<br/>
certain targets resist fire or cold more that others - so it&#39;s real easy to<br/>
lose a third of your power.  But for the most part, I am an instrument bard.<br/>
I might start working on my epic again (gave my scales away to other bards<br/>
in my old guild) since even though it is a sword, it is an instrument too.<br/>
Like a musical sword, yeah right, keep telling myself that.  Grrr, Verant.<br/>
But at least I *look* like a bard!<br/>
