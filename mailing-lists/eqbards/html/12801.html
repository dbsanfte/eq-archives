<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764210090">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I am Rhimshot, E&#39;Ci bard of 19 songs.  Since I got DDD, I have found <br/>
fighting with only songs to be very effective against blues.  The only time <br/>
I pull out my weapons is when there are others in the area of effect that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t take to kindly to wincing.<br/>
<br/>
However, most of the time, I can pull the critter in question to a safer <br/>
zone for AoEing.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that when I&#39;m in a group, the added effect to my songs from <br/>
using an instrument outweighs the damage I can do with my Obscidian <br/>
shard/Dragoon dirk.<br/>
<br/>
However, from reading this board, it strikes me that many of you still use <br/>
weapons on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
In what situations do you find it appropriate to use weapons instead of <br/>
getting the extra effects of instruments with songs?  I understand when you <br/>
have to fight with friendlies about, but when else?  Is it worth my time <br/>
and trouble to train up other weapon skills than piercing, or am I going to <br/>
be singing most of the time?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Rhimshot</div>
