<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900497209"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What time of day do you play? (And what time zone are you <br/>
&gt; in?) I find that the game is vastly different at different<br/>
&gt; time of the r/l day.  The peak hours for number of players<br/>
&gt; seems to be US evening hours. Not necessarily the quality<br/>
&gt; time.  Try all different hours of the day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be embarrassed to admit how often I&#39;m online.. Heh. I&#39;m usually online<br/>
from 5p-1a EST during the week and then 24/7 on the weekends. (*ahem*<br/>
believe it or not, I do have a life mixed in there.. hehe) People just<br/>
aren&#39;t selling them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; option is a combine dagger or a crookstinger.  A dirk is<br/>
&gt; good - my first choice but not for 75pp - you can get 2<br/>
&gt; combine daggers for that and have change for milk<br/>
&gt; and muffins!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought a Combine Longsword to take care of my magical mob requirements. I<br/>
was just looking for the Dirk for the day when I blessedly get dual wield.<br/>
As it is now I&#39;ve got a Dwarven Axe sitting in the bank that I&#39;ll use since<br/>
it&#39;s really fast.<br/>
<br/>
And on a different subject and trying to keep it Bard related: What can a<br/>
bard do (if anything) when he/she is being constantly robbed of his/her<br/>
kills by magic users? For example.. I&#39;m sitting on the training hill in<br/>
Crushbone just wailing away having a good ol&#39; time - nobody else is up there<br/>
(that I can see) and I&#39;m just plugging away at Centurions.. Lo&#39; and behold<br/>
the Trainer spawns.. I start whacking away at him thinking great, real<br/>
experience now - and *zap* *bang* *boosh* and the trainer is running to a<br/>
magic user that was hiding himself over the edge of the hill. Aparently (now<br/>
I know) the Trainer carries the Shiney Brass Shield sometimes.. I mutter my<br/>
profanities and the other person leaves (so I thought). Same thing happens<br/>
again.. And again.. I finally get sick of it and leave the hill. Is there<br/>
nothing that as a Bard we can do to prevent this sort of thing? I mean, I<br/>
wasn&#39;t camping for the shield (didnt even really know about it at first) but<br/>
my kills were being stolen. I&#39;ve camped before and gladly take turns with<br/>
any other groups that are present - but it&#39;s really annoying that there&#39;s<br/>
such rampant stealing like this and nothing that can be done about it. Whine<br/>
to Verrant? I doubt they&#39;d do anything.. Duel the caster? Bah, he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
accept. And neither of us were PvP&#39;s. Are we as Bard&#39;s just stuck to the<br/>
whims of Magic users?<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t even get into the massive and unbelievable amount of KS&#39;ing on the<br/>
new Brell Serillis server.. keeeeripes man. 100 people outside of Felwithe<br/>
going after the same MOB&#39;s.. I gave up on that server quickly.</div>
