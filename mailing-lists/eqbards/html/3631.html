&gt;Okay I have to admit that I am also guilty of twinking my mage character<br/>
&gt;with my bard who was level 16 when I started her.  At level 1 she was<br/>
&gt;given a few pieces of cloth and couple plat to start things off.  At level<br/>
&gt;4 she received some more plat and had a full set of cloth and a Giant<br/>
&gt;Snake Fang.  Nothing else since then.  All in all a minimal amount of<br/>
&gt;twinking.  Besides I would be pretty upset with myself if she started with<br/>
&gt;robe of the oracle, staff of writhing, savant cap and dusty bloodstained<br/>
&gt;gloves.  Hmmm... I saw these on a level 15 cleric in Unrest a few days<br/>
&gt;ago.  Man by twinking that much you fail to learn the qualities of your<br/>
&gt;class.  I know that I haven&#39;t even figure out half the tricks and tactics<br/>
&gt;for my mage.  By twinking I have been as bad as that bard you mentioned.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a shaman in Halas at lvl 4, and despite my bard still having<br/>
a snakeskin jerkin and RTS from a trip to paw, he has nothing from<br/>
him.  I&#39;ve been looting and saving EVERYTHING so I could get all<br/>
my first rank spells (well except for sense magic and endure cold,<br/>
which I don&#39;t see a use for yet) a worn great staff, a large bag,<br/>
a torch, and am saving for a small sewing kit, as bear skins are<br/>
common, and I need some armor.  I&#39;m enjoying those accomplishments<br/>
just as much as getting my first banded tunic for my bard, or my<br/>
first magic weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Almost equally as enjoyable as the social interaction in EQ is<br/>
the sense of accomplishment as you advance and improve <br/>
your stuff.  Short circuiting that just wrecks my enjoyment of that <br/>
aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Something neat about shamans (and I assume clerics, druids<br/>
and enchanters) is the ability to commit random acts of kindness.<br/>
Walk up to a fight, looks close?  Cast a heal or two, and a <br/>
couple of buffs, walk on.  I&#39;ve yet to find a way to do this well<br/>
with my bard.  The only way to do it is to directly affect the<br/>
mob, and that seems rude to me without an invitation, even if<br/>
there is no chance of kill stealing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any tips for this sort of activity as a bard?<br/>
