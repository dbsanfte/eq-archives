<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184996066">aye i forgot about that song.  i did very unofficial tests with a warrior<br/>
friend way back when i first got the song.  he said he did notice the slight<br/>
speedup over celerity, but seemed to also notice that he was hitting a lot<br/>
harder and more often for max damage.  and i did use beserker&#39;s instead of<br/>
chant/celerity until i got verses.  for one the tanks seemed to like it<br/>
better, not many people had procing weapons back when i hit level 42, and it<br/>
is always preferrable to play one song instead of 2 =)<br/>

&gt; There was some talk on the Concert Hall board that while the<br/>
&gt; increased speedup of Beserkers was not that impressive over<br/>
&gt; Celerity, the song greatly increased your chances of dual<br/>
&gt; wielding/double attacking.  One fellow there said he used one<br/>
&gt; of those logfile parsers to check his average damage using<br/>
&gt; Beserkers vs Celerity/Chant, and it was much higher using<br/>
&gt; Beserkers even though Celerity/Chant gave better visible<br/>
&gt; modifiers.  I&#39;m still 5 bubbles away from that song so YMMV.<br/>
