&gt;         1) Will I see any advantages in EQ?  I would assume lag should be<br/>
&gt; lessof an issue and zoning a bit faster...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With a cable modem, I still experience tremendous lag at some points.  Most<br/>
&gt; recently, I have been in Unrest playing in non-peak hours  (I live in Hawaii<br/>
&gt; so when I play at night its after midnight on the mainland).  Most of the<br/>
&gt; time there are only around 20 people in the one.  Even with that low number<br/>
&gt; of people, lag still hits during the peak of battle.  I am starting to<br/>
&gt; believe lag is more a function of the zone you are in versus your connection<br/>
&gt; speed.  Other people I am grouped with all seem to experience lag at the<br/>
&gt; same time I do, and they have regular modem connections.  In other zones<br/>
&gt; this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.  I was adventuring in the Karanas and<br/>
&gt; Beholder all last week and I never had any lag problems.  In regards to<br/>
&gt; zoning times, the amount of RAM you have makes a big difference.  I upgraded<br/>
&gt; from 64MB to 128MB of RAM and it makes a world of difference.  I can follow<br/>
&gt; people into a one and get to the other side 30 seconds before they arrive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are getting lag during peaks of battles, its quite possibly not<br/>
connection speed at all, but lag on YOUR side... your system may be having<br/>
trouble processing the amounts of images on the screen... with bard spell<br/>
effects and other spell effects firing off, plus several people in different<br/>
types of armor, the weak links in your system will begin to show, whether that<br/>
is borderline memory, a slower video card, a slower processor, or whatever...<br/>
<br/>
Try reducing graphical settings (going from double layer to single layer sky is<br/>
really simple and you don&#39;t lose too much, and bumping down particle density is<br/>
VERY useful)... also try switching into third person view as that seems to help<br/>
me sometimes...<br/>
<br/>
Another thing... I upgraded my memory as well, and damn if it isn&#39;t the best<br/>
thing I&#39;ve ever done to this ole computer.  Going from 64 to 128 megs is like<br/>
the difference between driving a dodge caravan and a ford mustang.</div>
