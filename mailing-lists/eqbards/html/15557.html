<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-641179415">Thanks for the info.  I&#39;m going to try to explore a little tonight.  I&#39;ve<br/>
read somewere that there are a couple of skels that are necro pets and to<br/>
touch them is to die. Is this area in the southeast corner where they are<br/>
located?<br/>
<br/>
On another note...<br/>
<br/>
Is the Login Server down?  My son is home sick and can&#39;t seem to log in.<br/>
I&#39;m at work so I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s doing anything wrong.  I installed<br/>
Evermon here and tried to check, but can&#39;t connect.  However, I don&#39;t know<br/>
whether this is because the server is down or Evermon won&#39;t work thru the<br/>
Company&#39;s firewall.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the good info on the Rathe Mtns,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; There are also giant skeletons to the left just after you come in from<br/>
&gt; Feerott. You go through this V between two mountains, follow the right<br/>
wall<br/>
&gt; until you get to a lizard camp. GO across the green area to the hill and<br/>
&gt; follow that<br/>
&gt; hill to the LEFT until you get back to the GS camp.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve just described how to get to the hill giant area.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Most of the people hunting hill giants there kill the<br/>
skeletons just to get more giants to spawn.  If you tell them<br/>
you&#39;d like to hunt the skeletons, I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t mind<br/>
letting you have them all.  Just be sure to learn where things<br/>
spawn and walk around.  That lizard or basilisk you see<br/>
wandering around might be a hill giant next time.<br/>
