 </span></blockquote>Ok here it goes. I have one. So does almost everyone I run with. Why?<br/>
Several reasons. Our troll shaman can be small without wasting mana. We can<br/>
go to grobb to bank and sell. Bouncer Hurd ignores us. These are but a few<br/>
reasons non bard types like the mask. A warning on the mask though. If the<br/>
illusion fails while you are singing ( it lasts approx 15 minutes before<br/>
saying your about to look like yourself again) what ever song you were<br/>
singing will be jammed. I have only been able to unjam it by camping or<br/>
zoning.<br/>
