&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the area we found they do this in was also<br/>
&gt; &gt; close enough to the water for the casters to nuke us while out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of sight.  :(  We had enough tankage that I let them beat on<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The way to handle this is to have your tank run clear past your party to the<br/>
&gt; inn.  This pulls them out of the water about to the slope.  Then you, the<br/>
&gt; bard, engages, the druid snares, you fear and the tank comes running back to<br/>
&gt; get some licks in.<br/>

(puller), so he ran out of range.  The caster then started<br/>
nuking the paladin who had healed the ranger, so he ran out of<br/>
range.  The caster then started nuking the bard, so he ran out<br/>
of range.  Then the caster started nuking me, who wasn&#39;t even<br/>
grouped with them.  It seemed given a choice between chasing<br/>
someone and nuking someone already in range, the goblin would<br/>
usually nuke.<br/>
