<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025335510">I read the original post and I thought to myself that it seemed to be a<br/>
rather rude statement.  SnowLynx explains it very well here how it sounded<br/>
to me.  Basically, &quot;You all are idiots, shut up if you don&#39;t know for sure.&quot;<br/>
and &quot;I happen to know the right answers, but I won&#39;t tell you.&quot;  That&#39;s a<br/>
little overboard, I&#39;m sure, but that&#39;s how it sounded to me.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Dear Berk,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &#39;Tis sad to see a bard speak so harshly. You don&#39;t know me well, then. My<br/>
&gt;&gt; intent is to prevent a novice bard from getting incorrect information.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Being a founder of the Soerbaird, with members who have put hours of time<br/>
&gt;&gt; into various Beta Phases, and much research into all things<br/>
&gt;&gt; Bardic, I would<br/>
&gt;&gt; say I have access to a lot of good information and research. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; need only to<br/>
&gt;&gt; turn to my fellow Soerbaird for accurate information I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; already have. A<br/>
&gt;&gt; level 25 bard in our guild seems to be quite a rich source of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>experiential<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; knowledge.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Our guild is built to be a boon for Bards, and thus it&#39;s my<br/>
&gt;&gt; charge, as well<br/>
&gt;&gt; as the charge all Soerbaird to be helpful.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I guess I don&#39;t think it&#39;s arrogant or selfish to ask people to<br/>
&gt;&gt; be accurate<br/>
&gt;&gt; rather than wrong. I don&#39;t think young bards want to be given incorrect<br/>
&gt;&gt; information. &quot;Guesstimates&quot; are fine, so long as they are posed<br/>
&gt;&gt; that way. My<br/>
&gt;&gt; contention was that people were posting incorrect information as truth.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; As for time, I give what time I have to providing a source of<br/>
&gt;&gt; information to<br/>
&gt;&gt; Soerbaird as well as to anyone interested. I built the Soerbaird<br/>
&gt;&gt; web site as<br/>
&gt;&gt; a resource for you or anyone else - as well as for my guild. I have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>indeed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; invested many hours into developing this information storehouse<br/>
&gt;&gt; for you and<br/>
&gt;&gt; anyone else.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; While it&#39;s only 1 week old, the site will soon be overflowing with<br/>
&gt;&gt; information for young and old bards alike. I can tell you the<br/>
&gt;&gt; leaders of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Soerbaird spend little time powergaming, and much time tinkering with<br/>
&gt;&gt; quests, writing ballads, and testing techniques for bards.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; As you might imagine, it takes time to document research, and I&#39;m always<br/>
&gt;&gt; grateful to those who do.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Why don&#39;t you enlighten all us poor dunces<br/>
&gt;&gt; with your incredible deductive prowess?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Oh, what, you don&#39;t have the time?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; You would prefer to passively benefit only<br/>
&gt;&gt; from the most exacting research of others,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and not their guesstimates? Personally I follow<br/>
&gt;&gt; the big grain of salt rule for almost anything<br/>
&gt;&gt; that comes across my cable modem.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; My preliminary deduction is that you are selfish<br/>
&gt;&gt; and arrogant.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; I could spend hours trying to correct a lot of misinformation<br/>
&gt;&gt; being posted<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; by some people. I would ask that if you aren&#39;t 100% sure about the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; information you give, don&#39;t post it as a statement, rather ask it as a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; question.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; It reveals to me there&#39;s a lot of poor deductive logic going on<br/>
&gt;&gt; with some<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; players - drawing conclusions from game experiences that are<br/>
&gt;&gt; more based on<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; coincidence than on good research.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; truth.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; There&#39;s a big difference between:<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- &quot;Hill Giants can outrun Selo&#39;s&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- &quot;A Hill Giant seemed to outrun my Selo&#39;s, has anyone else<br/>
&gt;&gt; seen this?&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The complicated thing is that one MAY have tested this fully, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; thus could<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; say:<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- &quot;I tried running 10 times from a Hill Giant and here are the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; results....&quot;<br/>
