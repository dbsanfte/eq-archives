&gt; Well I couldn&#39;t help myself, I had to try it....  I decided I&#39;d dust off Lullaby and try it.  Heh.<br/>
&gt; Never again.  I didn&#39;t die thanks to the Cleric and Shaman, but Lullaby had virtually no effect other<br/>
&gt; than Taunt.  If they&#39;re mezzed with Lullaby, it&#39;s so brief asto be negligible.  GZ would probably remind<br/>
&gt; me that &quot;higher level mobs have a greater chance of resisting&quot;, which is fine I suppose, but damn - give<br/>
&gt; me resist messages.<br/>

Lullaby works so well that people explicitly ask for it now in any fight with 3 or more MOBs (provided we<br/>
have no Enchanter).  It gets resisted some, but it still takes the extra (unattacked) MOBs out of the<br/>
fight for 50-75% of the time.  This is not as useful as Enchanter Mes, of course, and it entirely ties up<br/>
my songs for much of the fight, but it&#39;s a lot better than dying.  My level 32-36 group took out those<br/>
five Greater Ice Bones in a single battle, with about half damage and half mana drain overall.  Not that<br/>
anyone wanted to try it a second time...<br/>
