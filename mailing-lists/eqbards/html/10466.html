(Sung to the tune of Ants Marching by Dave Matthews Band)<br/>
<br/>
He wakes up in the morning<br/>
Drop of milk bite to eat and he&#39;s fighting<br/>
Never changes a thing<br/>
The week ends, the week begins<br/>
<br/>
She thinks, we fight with each other<br/>
Emote whatever were thinking<br/>
But we never say a thing<br/>
And these campers around us get meaner<br/>
<br/>
Take those campers<br/>
Place them on ignore until a quieter time<br/>
Root fails, you up and die<br/>
<br/>
Goes to fight putrid skellies<br/>
He&#39;s diseased, cleric heals up and he buffs him<br/>
And remembers being new<br/>
Playing at West Gate and cursing the guards<br/>
<br/>
Take those campers<br/>
Place them on ignore until a quieter time<br/>
Root fails, you up and die<br/>
<br/>
Driving down in Blackburrow<br/>
All these trains and up in the tunnel<br/>
Campers in every direction<br/>
No words exchanged no time to exchange them<br/>
And all the little gnolls go marching<br/>
Spells and swords and fists are flying<br/>
They all do it the same<br/>
They all do it the same way<br/>
<br/>
Gold and plat tempting the thoughts of a kill stealer<br/>
Tortured by spell cost<br/>
Exploits cutting the corners<br/>
There&#39;s a Runed staff, Runed staff, cast, cast<br/>
There&#39;s a group I&#39;m gonna offend, cast, cast, cast, cast<br/>
<br/>
Take those campers<br/>
Place them on ignore until a quieter time<br/>
Root fails, you up and die<br/>
