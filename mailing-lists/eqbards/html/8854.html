&gt; Can you safely get to the area where the Solusek Mage and Champion spawn by<br/>
&gt; singing the Invis song or are there mobs along the path that can See Invis?<br/>

have to do a corpse recovery and I can say that any of the goblins who had &quot;Solusek&quot; in front of<br/>
their names seem to be able to see invis.  (Which led to more corpse recoveries - ouch)<br/>
<br/>
You can probably invis part of the way in, then fight the rest of the way, though it&#39;s not that<br/>
hard to just clear the whole path.<br/>
