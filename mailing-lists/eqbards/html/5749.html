<b>Subject:</b> Yes, I can solo again! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-687305130">Around level 20, I found that I could no longer really solo anything<br/>
that was blue to me.  Sure, I could still kite stuff where kiting was<br/>
safe, but there was no way I could stand toe-to-toe with a mob and<br/>
bash it down, even twisting the best three songs I could think of.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was my armor, and I worked hard to replace all of my<br/>
banded with bronze plate.  By the time I accomplished that task, I had<br/>
advanced a few levels, and the mobs I wanted to take on were even<br/>
tougher.  Around level 25, I had pretty much resigned myself to no<br/>
more soloing, unless I wanted to spend 15 minutes kiting some stupid<br/>
bird for just a smidgen of experience.<br/>
<br/>
Well, with all of this talk about Screech lately, I decided to pull<br/>
that one out of the closet.  Now I find that with a combination of<br/>
Chains and Screech, I can take on those blues by myself again!<br/>
Woohoo!  It&#39;s not toe-to-toe, but it&#39;s a lot more interesting than<br/>
running around in circles.  Now I just have to find the places where<br/>
these guys hang out by themselves.  Hmmm...maybe those cyclops in the<br/>
Rathe Mountains will want to play.<br/>
