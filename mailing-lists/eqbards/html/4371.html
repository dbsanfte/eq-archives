<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329815310">Charm works extremely well against killstealers. I truely consider this song<br/>
revenge for the 26 levels of killstealing I had to endure from Druids and<br/>
wizards (and clerics vs. undead) before I got it.<br/>
<br/>
My best example of revenge is when a friend and I were in Runnyeye camping the<br/>
warlord so we could get him a BI crown. We were the only two people in the zone.<br/>
In comes a L28 druid and a L25 cleric, who decide they also want the warlord.<br/>
They however, were not willing to take turns alternating the warlord. I have<br/>
seen this so many times, especially at Derv camps in my teens - wizards and<br/>
Druids are notorious for &quot;taking&quot; simply because they can. Not all, mind you,<br/>
but too many. The druid declares that we will &quot;free for all&quot; the warlord since<br/>
she is not going to wait for a L29 Bard and L26 Cleric to take a turn. Goblin<br/>
Warlord spawns, and I easily charm it. The druid casts lightning 7 times on a<br/>
charmed warlord, and manages one hit. She then goes to melee it, with her below<br/>
average melee ability and manaless. I simply melee dual-wielded and bellow<br/>
constantly. I easily got the kill. After this demonstration, she apologized for<br/>
being rude, and agreed to take turns. *smiles at such a happy ending*<br/>
<br/>
The charm song is simply one of our most powerful combat related skills. The<br/>
other day late I pulled a barkeeper and a dry bones came. Again it was a friend<br/>
and I fighting, and both monsters together were too much. I charmed the<br/>
barkeeper and ordered him to guard me. We then saw:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;an undead barkeeper backstabs a dry bones skeleton for 154 points of damage&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The barkeeper went on to completely destroy the dry bones in under a minute, and<br/>
we got the exp since he was a pet. Charm is outstanding also for pulling<br/>
something off a wizard or cleric because if the charm works, they are out of<br/>
danger. I have yet to see any other song of ours that works so well against<br/>
monsters that con red. There was nothing quite so satisfying as being in Cazic<br/>
Thule and charming a justicar, and having it go from casting Greater Heal and<br/>
Daring on the other lizards to Smite Smite Smite Smite.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have noticed, is that ordering the pet to attack a specific target<br/>
does not always work properly. Sometimes it will attack a member of our party<br/>
that hurt it, even though it is still charmed. For this reason I use Guard me<br/>
and Guard Here. Guard Here is great if you will have to zone, Guard me is what I<br/>
use in combat.<br/>
