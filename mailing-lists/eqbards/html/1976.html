difference between the dirk and other special weapons is that<br/>
the mob who carries it spawns often, and has it every time.<br/>
It is going to cause a serious realignment of prices for<br/>
weapons in the L15-25 range.  I personally wouldn&#39;t pay more<br/>
than about 15pp for one, maybe 20pp if I were in Qeynos and<br/>
needed another ASAP.  Any more than that and it&#39;d be more cost<br/>
effective for my friends and me to trek to Crushbone and get<br/>
another.<br/>
