<div id="ygrps-yiv-917165400">We generally don&#39;t hunt with non guild members, unless they are people that<br/>
are being considered for guild admission. <br/>
On the occasion when people are invited, they are made well aware ahead of<br/>
time that they will not be eligible for loot, unless an item comes up that<br/>
nobody else wants (which is faily common these days).  If they don&#39;t like<br/>
it, they don&#39;t have to attend.<br/>
<br/>
This really only applies to dragon/god class mobs.  If we&#39;re just getting<br/>
planar armor, then generally it is available to all that attend.  Sometimes<br/>
we&#39;ll make exceptions, i.e. Player A has been to 40 planes runs and still<br/>
hasn&#39;t gotten a breastplate.  Player B is there for the first time as a<br/>
guest.  Generally we will tell Player B ahead of time that he wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
eligible for a breastplate should it drop.<br/>

So what happens with this point system when non guild members are hunting <br/>
with you?  On my server (The Rathe) some of the more powerful guilds use <br/>
this method for distributing planes goodies.  The problem occurs when others<br/>
<br/>
are there with them and they still apply their &quot;point&quot; system to looting.  <br/>
As most of their guild has been going to the planes since they opened late <br/>
last summer if other people go that aren&#39;t in that guild they usually get <br/>
squat.  This has led to MANY arguments between guilds.<br/>
<br/>
So if there are other groups there do you /random to see which guild gets <br/>
it?<br/>

&gt;I really like the loot scheme your guild has.  I am going to foward the <br/>
&gt;link<br/>
&gt;to my guild for review.  Thanks for sharing it with us :)<br/>

&gt;click on the DKPs link at the the top.  its been revised a few times in<br/>
&gt;recent months, but those are the current rules.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;just very recently, we have new rules for planar armor that we never had<br/>
&gt;before.  many new 46+ characters were reapoing up items that many very old<br/>
&gt;level 50 characters needed and who had put in so much more time.  so these<br/>
&gt;are new, i haven&#39;t even read them myself:<br/>

&gt; &gt; point system.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any chance you could point me to the rules? =)<br/>
