<div id="ygrps-yiv-45273413">After hearing so many good stories of traveling to the Castle to retrieve a<br/>
famous little dirk from an infamous villain, I decided to try and get me one, to<br/>
practice piercing, and to make it a primary weapon.  Those mino axes make any<br/>
bard look menacing, but are just too heavy.<br/>
<br/>
When I arrived, the throne room was empty of everything, the room behind was<br/>
clean as a whistle, and the Tower- camped by a Dwarven Cleric named Molasar. I<br/>
asked if I could help with DVinn a time or two, so that I could get a dirk, and<br/>
help him get one as well. He immediately showed me one in the trade window. He<br/>
stated that he&#39;d beaten DVinn 13 times so far, and sold as many dirks. He wanted<br/>
20 platinum for one, but I wanted to pull it from the Dragoon&#39;s bloody hand!  I<br/>
stayed around to kill a few prophets and emissaries, then a cleric and his<br/>
paladin friend were benevolent enough to help me. We eventually got 3 dirks in<br/>
45 minutes or so. It was great fun teaming up to win the prize, and not just buy<br/>
it. It makes things much more interesting for me, and more gratifying.<br/>
