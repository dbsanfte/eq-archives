<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-309559107">Early (3am) yesterday, some folks from my guild broke the spawn in the Sol-B<br/>
King room - hehe, believe it or not - it was uncamped! Then we held the room<br/>
until around 8.30 this morning.<br/>
<br/>
About 7pm last night, I dinged into 43 and ran off to Freeport to buy the<br/>
Dirge.  Ok, been warned dont be too close to your target when you play it.<br/>
Decided to skip the &quot;West Freeport see how many dead rats I can make&quot; test<br/>
and just head back to Sol-B.  On the way back thru Nekultos, I saw a<br/>
halfling druid friend (even con) looting his corpse. &quot;What got you killed<br/>
here?&quot; &quot;Look out for that Dragoon!&quot; &quot;Want some revenge?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, somehow I managed to get the &#39;Goon agro&#39;d on me and kited him around<br/>
until my friend could finish getting his stuff and mem up his spells or<br/>
whatever.  So, now we are ready to fight him and I Selos off a bit and<br/>
decide to open with my first ever Dirge.  Viola!  hit by non-melee for 228!<br/>
Hehe, take that ya Tier&#39;Dal meanie you!  From there, the druid snared and<br/>
nuke pulled him while I commenced the double Yak-Attack. One dead dragoon!<br/>
<br/>
So, my questions are:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Will the song damage other party members if they are too close to the<br/>
target when you play it?  I know it will hurt the bard but what about other<br/>
party members?  And what about other PC&#39;s non-party members?<br/>
<br/>
2.  What practical use is this song? The re-cycle time is so long as to make<br/>
it quite limited.  Indoors, its application seems limited - not real sure<br/>
what the distance to avoid damage is but that probably constrains its use.<br/>
It is AE so on one hand it damages multiple mobs but then do you have all of<br/>
them agro on you? If you have an enchanter, then you need to use it before<br/>
they do crowd control so timing is an issue.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Does it get resisted like other casters dmg spells?  Full resists?<br/>
Partial resists?  The da&#39;goon took 228 dmg and I thought 311 was the base.<br/>
But they are know to have high MR factors.<br/>
