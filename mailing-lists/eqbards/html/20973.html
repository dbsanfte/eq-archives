<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149217178">it&#39;s easy to pull singles from the ballroom.  me and another guy cleared out<br/>
mistmoore.  we&#39;d clear to the maid/butler then go thru the graveyard and clear<br/>
out to the princess.  51 bard, 53 sk.  i think you have to be 50+ or use harmony<br/>
liberally in order to pull singles.<br/>
