<div id="ygrps-yiv-568159940">It sounds like you have a really nice guild - you seem to be close in levels<br/>
and enjoy being with your friends.  That is what it is really all about.<br/>
Our guildmaster is constantly reminding us that we are not going on this<br/>
raid or that run because we are after the loot but that we are doing this<br/>
because we enjoying being with a fine bunch of folks.  Yes, we have had<br/>
growth but so far it looks to be very good.  People have brought on more<br/>
friends and we spend a good amount of time with people getting to know them.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that brings success to guilds - who enjoy doing things<br/>
(raids, runs, hunting, camping) together is working hard to maintain<br/>
closeness in level.  Eventually that means a lot of people are level 50.  We<br/>
have roughly 38 people who are &quot;planar&quot; (&gt;=46) and 34 of those are 49 or 50.<br/>
Then 14 people who are 39 to 45. And 11 who are 30 to 36. And 6 now 20 to<br/>
30.  And these are primary&#39;s.  Dont even ask about twinks - no one has yet<br/>
taken a census.<br/>
<br/>
Originally I joined a guild that was focused on the &#39;role-playing&#39; aspects<br/>
and less so on levels and such.  We had great fun doing it that way as<br/>
well - they were and still are a great guild and a wonderful family.  So, it<br/>
really depends on what you want to do.  And its not bad to have a variety of<br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
So, what I have seen is a growth from &#39;pick-up&#39; groups to &#39;regular group&#39; to<br/>
&#39;guild groups.&#39;  It&#39;s been a great deal of fun!<br/>

&gt; I wish my guild was as large and high level as yours; we are a great group<br/>
&gt; but smaller.  We normally have just under 20 total on a busy night; have a<br/>
&gt; wizard who just hit 50 last week; a couple in the 40&#39;s; myself and about 5<br/>
&gt; others in mid-to upper 30&#39;s...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I look forward to the future when the majority advance high enough to do<br/>
&gt; stuff like this.  Thanks for the info Sylly!<br/>
