<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716972280">I am not convinced that MOBs hate Bards just because they&#39;re Bards, but <br/>
my experience in numerous crowded dungeons suggests the following:<br/>
<br/>
1)  It is not just our attack songs that are Area Effect.  All of our <br/>
party buffs are also AE.  This is obvious from the fact that party <br/>
members can be in or out of effect range for all of them (and the area <br/>
for many of these songs is quite large).  When multiple MOBs are pulled, <br/>
typically only one has taken actual damage, the others come along because <br/>
they are linked.  The taunt value of attacking the neighbor of a MOB is <br/>
apparently less than the taunt value of attempting to cast a spell on the <br/>
MOB directly (songs with positive effects on MOB enemies are just as <br/>
irritating to them as songs with negative effects on themselves).  This <br/>
is why I have been able to attract as many as ten lizzies in CT, and as <br/>
many as eight undead in Befallen even though my party only pulled a <br/>
couple.  This is not because I am a Bard per se, it is because of the way <br/>
that MOBs evaluate Bard song effects.<br/>
<br/>
2)  When a new MOB appears, it evaluates the situation in order to <br/>
determine which enemy to whack.  Among the criteria (all else being <br/>
equal):  1.  MOBs will whack casters because they are more immediately <br/>
threatening.  Bards are casters.  2.  MOBs will attack the closest enemy. <br/>
 Bards are often in melee range.  3.  MOBs will attack the weakest enemy. <br/>
 Bards have lower hit points than most melee-based player types.  4.  <br/>
MOBs will attack the first character to cast on them.  Bardics songs are <br/>
AE and are usually the first to affect a MOB.<br/>
<br/>
All of these &quot;rules&quot; make sense to some degree.  Unfortunately, the net <br/>
effect is that most MOBs who are weakly engaged will (by adding all of <br/>
these rules together) attack who?  The Bard.<br/>
<br/>
This still does not explain why, when I was in Permafrost with 30 other <br/>
players, at least 20 of whom were higher level than me, and I was <br/>
standing well to the back of the main group, TWO Ice Giants ran straight <br/>
through a pack of level 40-50 druids, rangers, clerics, warriors, <br/>
wizards, enchanters, et al, to jump on ME.  ;P<br/>

&gt; I also think Bard Hate is a myth.  In my whole career, I&#39;ve yet to see a MOB<br/>
&gt; come after me simply because I was a bard.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been hearing rumors that &quot;bard hate&quot; does not really<br/>
&gt; &gt; exist... Anyone actually have proof that it does?<br/>
