<div id="ygrps-yiv-481271068">Sol A and Permafrost aren&#39;t dungeons you go to to find pickup groups,<br/>
IMO. First, anything interesting is considerably farther in past the<br/>
zone line, and secondly because of that, you need a group that knows how<br/>
to work together. Snaring is mandatory, as is a puller who knows what<br/>
the heck they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, they are 2 of the most fun dungeons in the game, again<br/>
IMO. Especially on older servers where Lower Guk is so camped you have<br/>
to book an appointment for a spawn spot, these 2 dungeons are probably<br/>
the only places where you will be able to explore dungeons the way I<br/>
think Verant really had in mind when designing the game. (assuming you<br/>
resist the temptation to go to a spoiler site for maps and mob<br/>
locations)<br/>
<br/>
I missed these 2 the first time around, mainly because neither were<br/>
itemized until after they were way green to my character, but I&#39;ve had a<br/>
great time in them with my new character, and am a bit sad now at 37<br/>
that they are getting too green for me.<br/>

&gt; Man.  I friggin&#39; hate goblins.  They train up like they work for Amtrak.<br/>
&gt; Sol A and Runnyeye are the worst, Permafrost isn&#39;t quite so bad.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been in bad pickup groups, but I have died and left<br/>
&gt; empty-handed every time I&#39;ve tried to fight in Sol A as a bard.  So far I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; made excursion there three separate times for vambrace and boot items and<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s usually just about 12 people in the zone, half of them resting from<br/>
&gt; Sol B.  I have yet to even get to the spawn locations for these items.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a strong guild, so getting them together for this sort of thing<br/>
&gt; just isn&#39;t possible.  So every once in a while I cruise to Sol A and ask if<br/>
&gt; anyone is fighting in there and need a bard.  So far no luck.  Just another<br/>
&gt; couple of empty-handed deaths and a run back to Cazic-Thule where the<br/>
&gt; coordinated people seem to fight.<br/>
