<div id="ygrps-yiv-616197477">Looking good is number one when it comes to armor selections - the AC<br/>
differences in the armors hardly matter - certainly the higher costs are in<br/>
no way justified (steel is just something for rich people to buy with their<br/>
otherwise useless plats.)  There are weight differences and sometimes you<br/>
will endure the excess weights for the visual benefits!<br/>
<br/>
Only a few days ago, I managed to loot a hat off a cyclops - possibly a<br/>
named one (Broon, froon? I think I just stumbled onto the party killing it<br/>
and gave em a few helpful bellows when they were kinda low hp and they gave<br/>
me the loot for stopping to help.  It&#39;s not like I solo&#39;d him or anything.)<br/>
- any how its got a nice little stat boost (can&#39;t think of str or dex<br/>
orwhat) and is not visible when you wear it. I&#39;v taken to that instead of my<br/>
bronze helm - which gets incredibly hot when you are camped in extended<br/>
combat.  (Of course I lose the &#39;effect&#39; of arriving at a city gate and<br/>
removing the help to chat with folks. &lt;g&gt;)  Hehe but would I wear it if it<br/>
gave you that funny little &#39;top-knot&#39; look that the cyco&#39;s have :-) ???<br/>

		My take is that bards are performers and should look<br/>
		good doing it.  I wear blackened armor in all the<br/>
		visible spots except the head where I have a woven<br/>
		cap.  It&#39;s only AC2 but it&#39;s the best I have found<br/>
		that is invisible (half-elf BTW).  I have heard a silk<br/>
		turban from the named giant (Hettar I believe) in<br/>
		Oasis is also invisible.<br/>
<br/>
		I receive a large number of spontaneous compliments<br/>
		and I revel in it.  *grin*<br/>
