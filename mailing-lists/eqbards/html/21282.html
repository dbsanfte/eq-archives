<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354474759">I am very angry, disappointed, and confused as I compose this <br/>
letter.  My first inclination is to shout, scream, and curse.  <br/>
However, I realize that is not the proper course of action to take <br/>
when you are attempting to communicate in a rational manner.  So, <br/>
instead of all the above, I have simply sat back and tried to <br/>
evaluate my emotions.  Why am I feeling this way?  Why is it Verant <br/>
seems to totally misunderstand our plight?  Surely it&#39;s a <br/>
misunderstanding because I honestly don&#39;t see Verant doing<br/>
something <br/>
to intentionally run players away or anger them.  So where does this <br/>
lead me?  I guess the big disparity, as I see it, lies in what <br/>
players of Bards see as their role in the overall scheme and what <br/>
Verant sees as the Bard&#39;s role.  Obviously there is a big<br/>
disparity <br/>
here.  Obviously I don&#39;t understand what Verant perceives as the <br/>
Bard&#39;s role in EverQuest.  <br/>
<br/>
All I know is how I perceive my role in EverQuest.  Let me explain <br/>
how I see it in the hopes someone from Verant can explain where I <br/>
differ.  For me, a bard is the ultimate group member.  We are <br/>
designed to operate most effectively in the company of others.  We <br/>
are often called a Jack of All Trades, but a master of none.  We have <br/>
so many abilities that are spread among several other classes.  Need <br/>
someone to buff your attack speed?  A Bard can do that and more at <br/>
higher levels. Need to slowdown a mobs attack speed?  A Bard can do <br/>
that and more at higher levels.  Need a boost to your resistances?  A <br/>
Bard is one of the best at boosting resistances.  Need to regenerate <br/>
health or mana faster?  Again, a bard can do this.  Need to charm a <br/>
creature for a short while and make him your ally?  Bards.  Need <br/>
someone who can wear armor and take a FEW hits ok?  Bards.  Need to <br/>
get from one location to another fast and teleports or gates are not <br/>
feasible?  Bards.  <br/>
<br/>
There are MANY things a bard can do but usually at a reduced capacity <br/>
compared to the class it is imitating.  One thing that many bards <br/>
attempt to play is the role of limited crowd control.  We have never <br/>
excelled at this ability nor did we ever expect to excel at this <br/>
ability.  We certainly don&#39;t excel at any other abilities we <br/>
imitate.  No, we saw our role as more of a contingency crowd <br/>
controller.  Our line of songs designed for these roles were very <br/>
limited in scope.  The first crowd control ability we receive is in <br/>
the form of a point blank area of effect song.  By point blank I mean <br/>
it extends in a radius around the bard.  This song would never be as <br/>
effective as enchanter&#39;s spells because it requires the bard to<br/>
be in <br/>
the thick of things and pretty much doing nothing else but playing <br/>
this song.  The duration on the song was such that it did not lend <br/>
itself to being &quot;twisted&quot;.  Waking mobs would rightly attack<br/>
the bard <br/>
that had put them to sleep and the duration on the song was such that <br/>
mobs WOULD wake at some point.  This song would work in an emergency <br/>
or a bad pull┬àat a minimum it would allow for the group to<br/>
collect <br/>
their thoughts rapidly and get organized or make the decision to <br/>
fight or flee.  <br/>
<br/>
The next form of crowd control a bard receives is in the form of a <br/>
targeted mez.  Well, the duration on this song (and all bard songs <br/>
for the most part) dictate that a bard can only keep a very limited <br/>
number of creatures mezzed.  With no resists and a good connection, I <br/>
would hazard the average bard could keep three separate targets <br/>
mezzed.  This is not even considering the difficulty targeting <br/>
closely packed mobs.  Now, a bard doing this type of crowd control is <br/>
also typically able to do little else.  If he is only keeping one <br/>
target mezzed, then he may have time to twist in one or two more <br/>
songs and maybe melee for two rounds.  Try to keep 2 mezzed and<br/>
it&#39;s <br/>
usually a full-time job.  Keeping 3 mezzed would require a lot of <br/>
luck, but most likely would be the bard getting beat on a few times <br/>
as he remezzes one that resisted.  Again, not nearly as effective as <br/>
an enchanter and the bard is effectively removed from combat (albeit <br/>
keeping other mobs also out of combat).<br/>
<br/>
Still yet another form of crowd control available to the bard is his <br/>
ability to charm.  This is a risky method and takes a lot of <br/>
practice, timing, and coordination.  I daresay you see more bards <br/>
willing to charm creatures in combat than you do any other class.  <br/>
There are some problems associated with this song that have never <br/>
been addressed.  The biggest issue is that on a non-pvp server, this <br/>
song cannot be refreshed until it wears off.  On a pvp server, this <br/>
song can be refreshed over and over as needed.  What is more <br/>
confusing is the higher-level charm song.  The level 39 song,<br/>
Solon&#39;s <br/>
Bewitching Brauvara, includes a Magic Resistance Debuff!  Why would a <br/>
charm song that cannot be refreshed include a Magic Resist Debuff?  <br/>
Players cannot cast on the charmed mob because it is now a pet.  The <br/>
MR does not last any longer than the charm, so it does not make it <br/>
easier to reapply the charm.  It really leads one to believe a few <br/>
things.  This song is meant to be refreshable and that whomever <br/>
develops songs for the bard class sure doesn&#39;t pay attention to <br/>
detail.  It also makes one wonder if anyone at Verant really has an <br/>
understanding how bard songs operate on a production server.<br/>
<br/>
When you have an Enchanter in the group, then a bard is not needed in <br/>
the role of crowd control.  That&#39;s fine and wonderful because<br/>
there <br/>
are many other roles the bard can fulfill.  We can buff attack speed, <br/>
combat stat abilities, defensive abilities, add in health regen, mana <br/>
regen, buff resistances, slow-down mobs, debuff mobs, cast dots as <br/>
well as debuffs, and reduce downtime.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am getting at is a bard looks at his group makeup, <br/>
then at his songs and best determines his role within the group.  No <br/>
other class really needs to do much in this area.  And this is where <br/>
things get confusing.  Bards have a nice line of songs developed to <br/>
perform a role as crowd control.  If there is not an enchanter in the <br/>
group, it might behoove the bard to memorize at least one of these <br/>
type of songs.  Why would Verant give bards the ability to perform <br/>
this role if it is not one they really intended bards to perform?  <br/>
<br/>
Bard songs are known to improve as a bard levels.  This has always <br/>
seemed to be the reason bard&#39;s only earned one song a level. <br/>
Unlike <br/>
SPELL casters, bard songs do not receive an upgraded version later.  <br/>
Instead, the song increases in power as the bard increases in level.  <br/>
The Hymn of restoration at level 6 that only healed a mere 4 points a <br/>
pulse now heals 19 points a pulse.  Why is it unreasonable to think <br/>
the crowd control abilities would also not increase in power as the <br/>
bard levels?  One would think a level 50 bard would have the same <br/>
chance to mesmerize that level 40 Drolvarg as he did at 15 versus <br/>
that level 5 Orc (not accounting for any magic resistance).  One <br/>
would CERTAINLY assume the level 50 bard would have near 100% chance <br/>
to mesmerize that level 5 Orc now!  This has not been the case.  <br/>
<br/>
So what is the role of a bard?  Certainly more than a walking, <br/>
talking mana-battery!  Does the loss of crowd control really define <br/>
the bard class?  No, we have been surviving ok without it for these <br/>
past 10 months already.  However, it severely diminishes the role <br/>
bards can play and it certainly forces groups into preset group make-<br/>
ups.  Higher level groups learn they can&#39;t do certain things<br/>
without <br/>
an enchanter in a group.  It takes a lot of the challenge out of the <br/>
game and it forces people into fewer and fewer group options.  While <br/>
the bard may not be as effective as the enchanter may, he can be <br/>
somewhat effective.  While a group may not delve as deep into a <br/>
dungeon with a bard instead of an enchanter, at least they can delve <br/>
somewhat into the dungeon with the hope the bard can manage a few <br/>
extra mobs.  This is what I used to perceive as my role, to make up <br/>
for any deficiencies in a group to make it a productive group.  This <br/>
is the challenge of the bard class that makes it one of the most <br/>
exciting classes to play.  The ability to take a &quot;broken&quot;<br/>
group and <br/>
make it work is amazing.  Crowd control is a significant part of this <br/>
role when there is no enchanter available.  Bard&#39;s with crowd<br/>
control <br/>
abilities open up more groups to be able to accomplish things they <br/>
would not have dared without ONE other class being present.<br/>
<br/>
So, I ask Verant.  What IS the role of a bard?  Please help clear up <br/>
this disparity and tell us how YOU see us using our songs.<br/>
