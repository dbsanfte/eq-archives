<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554163721">The bard&#39;s role certainly does evolve thru his career.  Looks like you are<br/>
going thru levels now where you are spending most if not all of your time in<br/>
groups.  That&#39;s what I did and really enjoyed myself from 20 thru 35.<br/>
Around 35, I figured out I could solo with fear chain and spent a lot of<br/>
time doing that or grouping with 1 or 2 others.  By 40, I got into a guild<br/>
with alot of ppl my level and got back into groups and guild groups are<br/>
loads better than pickup groups.  Also I began to get exposed to multiple<br/>
group expeditions.<br/>
<br/>
As it has been pointed out, at the higher levels, in good guilds, all of the<br/>
bases are usually covered and the job of &quot;filling in the gaps&quot; that a bards<br/>
were good at in their 30&#39;s is no longer needed nor would they be very good<br/>
at it.  By then, the bard&#39;s role is mana regen and resist & other buffing.<br/>
Once you get out of Lower Guk, bard&#39;s can deal some damage but really have<br/>
to limit their exposure to melee.<br/>
<br/>
We may think that the bard dieing alot is some how heroic but I bet the<br/>
other classes think: &quot;the dumb bard got himself killed again...&quot; just like<br/>
we think about the dumb caster that nukes too early and too often.  I should<br/>
have thought about this more when I was younger and probably done more to<br/>
not get killed and sometimes that means stepping out of the melee.<br/>
<br/>
When I join a group to kill a dragon or hunt a god or clear a plane, I very<br/>
often hear: &quot;oh good!  we get a bard!&quot;  And yes this is from the casters<br/>
(clerics are casters btw).  Bards are unique in that they can generate<br/>
something very valuable from nothing and replicate it widely.  Mana.  The<br/>
whole game is about using mana to detract from the opponents health points<br/>
faster than he can detract all of yours.  One of the most important things<br/>
is assignment to groups.  Getting the right mix of ppl together so that the<br/>
healer can keep them alive.<br/>
<br/>
Mob &lt;--- tank &lt;--- healer &lt;--- bard<br/>
Mob &lt;--- caster &lt;--- healer &lt;--- bard<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned that &quot;you end up supporting the support classes.&quot;  I<br/>
prefer to think of it as being the endless fuel supply that makes the whole<br/>
group more powerful.  (Endless as long as you don&#39;t die.)<br/>
<br/>
The high level monsters are so strong that you need 3 to 6 sometimes more<br/>
groups to kill them.  The correct mix of classes is as important as the<br/>
number of people.  No one group let alone person can do it without all of<br/>
the others.  I guess the classes that &quot;shine&quot; the most are: cleric<br/>
(healing), monk (pulling), warrior (tanking), enchanter (crowd control) &<br/>
bard (mana).  I think that all of the classes &quot;feel weak&quot; at the higher<br/>
levels.  But this is due to the level difference between player and mob.  I<br/>
wonder what Verant is thinking.  Will there be &quot;blues&quot; and &quot;yellows&quot; that<br/>
single groups high 40&#39;s and lo 50&#39;s can handle.<br/>
<br/>
To those of you who have not been on a multiple group event, you think it&#39;s<br/>
bad for the &#39;casual player&#39; who does not want to spend 30 to 45 minutes<br/>
looking for a group.  Think about doing a break-in where it takes 2 to 3<br/>
hours just to get everyone into the zone.  Dragons are just as bad: an hour<br/>
or more to assemble 3 groups to clear giants.  Another hour or more to<br/>
assemble the rest of the groups.  An hour to buff everyone.  And maybe 5<br/>
minutes to fight the dragon.  Then an hour or more for CR and loot.  And<br/>
then 2-4 hours or more to replace the exp you may have lost.<br/>
<br/>
Like anything, the more you do it, the better you get.  And then it gets<br/>
boring.  Naggy? We did Vox last night can&#39;t we go kill Dojorn tonight?<br/>

&gt; This is my take on the bard&#39;s role, since this thread is sort of turning<br/>
&gt; that way:  I get most of this perspective leading a regular group as<br/>
&gt; cleric (or in my football playing friend&#39;s words, I am the quarterback)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We all think (with little doubt) that<br/>
&gt; so far the least important char in our group is the wizard.  She&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; great player (remember how I said I never had to cast heals on her?<br/>
&gt; Thats a pretty good sign of a good wizard), but I don;t think the group<br/>
&gt; really hurts without her. </span></blockquote></div>
