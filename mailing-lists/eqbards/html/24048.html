<div id="ygrps-yiv-148998692">*sigh* Did Kenross get sold on ebay?  To say that the needed change to the<br/>
lvl 19 song (adding see invis) made the lvl 24 song pointless is about the<br/>
stupidest thing I have read on this or any list.   Next time you need to see<br/>
invis with a pet caster around see how much they enjoy recasting their pet<br/>
when you pulse clouding to see invis.  Or maybe when you are fighting invis<br/>
mobs in PoA or another zone and have to use your flute so your party can see<br/>
the invis mob you are fighting.<br/>

The level 24 song is ultravision/see invis.  This song was relatively but<br/>
not entirely useless until<br/>
Verant modified level 19 to be not just invis but invis/see invis.  At which<br/>
point, they never bothered to<br/>
address the fact that this made level 24 pointless.  So looking at the<br/>
weakness of 24 to justify the<br/>
weakness of DDD isn&#39;t a good comparison.  Particularly since Verant just<br/>
explicitly modified DDD to make<br/>
it &quot;good&quot; in their way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Verant has never in any way indicated that DDD was tuned with PvP in<br/>
mind.  In general, their<br/>
approach is to make songs/spells work differently on blue and red servers in<br/>
order to balance for PvP.  In<br/>
the absence of any other information, I am forced to assume that they<br/>
believe that this song is balanced<br/>
for blue server play.  I couldn&#39;t disagree with them more.<br/>
