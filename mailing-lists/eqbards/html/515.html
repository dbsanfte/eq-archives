<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602355280">exactly my thoughts.  a roleplaying bard needs a bardish sword, and a<br/>
bastard sword just doesn&#39;t cut it for me.  if there were a longsword<br/>
that improved singing skill, or let you use songs that required an<br/>
instrument that would be a catch.  tell me you wouldn&#39;t like to get the<br/>
drum bonus for accelerando while still wielding a sword.  or the lute<br/>
bonus for hymn while fighting.  right now it looks like high level<br/>
bards are relegated to the back row while buffing and letting others<br/>
fight.<br/>
that sucks<br/>

&gt; I also was thinking of a bard specific weapon ,<br/>
&gt; something like the singing <br/>
&gt; sword . <br/>
