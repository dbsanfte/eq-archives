<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Bard Training in Kunark <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062701566">We had a<br/>
song vendor and that&#39;s all we needed.  Parry and Riposte were late additions<br/>
and no bards hit high enough levels to get em anyway.<br/>
<br/>
- So is everyone saying that no lower level bards beta tested Kunark?  I<br/>
find that amazing!<br/>
