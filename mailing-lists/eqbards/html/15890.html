<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861995519">Shada&#39;s guild on Mithaniel Marr and my guild on Erollisi Marr both use a<br/>
point system.  I don&#39;t really know all the details of Shada&#39;s, but I think<br/>
they&#39;re fairly similar.<br/>
<br/>
Basicially how it works is this.  Every item that drops from a<br/>
god/dragon/dracolich/etc is assigned a point value based on the percieved<br/>
worth of the item.  We use a 1-5 scale with a McVaxius&#39; Horn of Suckiness<br/>
being an example of a 1, and a Cloak of Flames being an example of a 5.  For<br/>
every raid that you attend, you recieve 1 point.  When an item drops, the<br/>
person with the most points, from an eligible class (no RBB&#39;s for wizards,<br/>
or eyepatches for warriors) has first claim to the item.  If two or more<br/>
people with the same amount of points want the same item, then we random it<br/>
between them (mind you, this is rare, since we have a pretty large points<br/>
base now).<br/>
<br/>
Its works amazingly well.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had a single arguement over<br/>
loot since we started with this system a few months ago, and we know within<br/>
about 15 seconds of when something drops who gets it.<br/>

I was looking at these posts, and am very interested in this point system.<br/>
<br/>
Any chance you could point me to the rules? =)<br/>
