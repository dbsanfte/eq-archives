<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444540001">Chords of Dissonance is an area spell.  And that&#39;s exactly what it<br/>
does.  It effects an area.  Just like when it rains, it rains on<br/>
everyone in the area, not just the bad people.  So proceed with caution<br/>
when using area spells.  Don&#39;t just get greedy and try to kill a<br/>
million things to get a ton of experience.  Dork.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And while I&#39;m on the soapbox, why did Verant make it<br/>
&gt; where merchants and<br/>
&gt; guards attack you if you sing Chords of Dissonance<br/>
&gt; in their vicinity?  I am<br/>
&gt; a wood elf from Kelethin.  I obviously bear no<br/>
&gt; ill-will to the merchants and<br/>
&gt; guards of Kelethin.  They sell me goods and protect<br/>
&gt; me from the evil orcs of<br/>
&gt; Crushbone.  But here is what happened to me the<br/>
&gt; other day.  I was mucking<br/>
&gt; around the orc camp south of the entrance to<br/>
&gt; Crushbone attempting to rid the<br/>
&gt; forest of the orc infestation.  I was going solo and<br/>
&gt; was in the process of<br/>
&gt; fighting an orc centurion.  I was singing the Chords<br/>
&gt; to help dispatch the<br/>
&gt; centurion.  I almost had him finished off when a<br/>
&gt; guard spawned behind me.<br/>
&gt; He immediately killed me and then killed the orc<br/>
&gt; cent himself.  To say the<br/>
&gt; least I was quite upset.  Guildmaster, guards and<br/>
&gt; merchants /con red to me<br/>
&gt; so it would be stupid if I attacked them on purpose.<br/>
&gt;  It seems to me that<br/>
&gt; these type of NPCs should be unkillable in the first<br/>
&gt; place.  If I kill a<br/>
&gt; guildmaster then how will other players train?  I<br/>
&gt; would be willing to bet<br/>
&gt; that they are unkillable, even by high-level<br/>
&gt; players.  If they are<br/>
&gt; unkillable by players, IMO the Chords of Dissonance<br/>
&gt; should have no effect on<br/>
&gt; them whatsoever and they should not attack PCs<br/>
&gt; singing it.  Am I justified<br/>
&gt; in my opinion on this? Dissenting opinions are<br/>
&gt; appreciated.<br/>
