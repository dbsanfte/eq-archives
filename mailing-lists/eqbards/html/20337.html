I know I wasn&#39;t the most prolific poster to the list, but I wanted to thank<br/>
everyone for the list; its been a great source of information sure, but the<br/>
community aspect has been invaluable both in and out of EQ.  I know of no<br/>
other EQ group which has bonded like eqbards, and to a lesser degree the<br/>
concert hall; I am truly proud to have been among the ranks.<br/>
<br/>
In parting, I bid you all take care, have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
-Tork@Nameless<br/>
