<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112341012">I just made 26 and couldn&#39;t train Instil Doubt in Freeport (though it was<br/>
late I was tired and I think I didn&#39;t check the other guildmaster), no<br/>
biggie, I need to go to Kelethin to buy Screech anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So, just want to make sure that I am headed in the right direction, based on<br/>
what I am reading on this list I am selling my stat boosting items that take<br/>
me over 100 and replacing them with AC, I also traded my Kobold Hide boots<br/>
for a Staff of Writhing (I know, it won&#39;t proc for two more levels but it is<br/>
better than my polished granite Tomahawk). The charisma hit was no fun, it<br/>
takes me to 98 chr, but I will probably strade a +3str earing for a +?<br/>
charisma earing and be fine.<br/>
<br/>
I have about 400pp now (though barefoot :o) still have to sell the PGT, and<br/>
trying to decide on armour choices, I can&#39;t play a lot, and when I do will<br/>
probably solo, so my money situation is not going to skyrocket, here are my<br/>
partially informed ideas, all suggestions are very welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Arms:<br/>
Keeping my Barbed Armplates: (AC 7. +2 Dexterity), Steel Vambraces: (AC 8)<br/>
only get me 1 AC<br/>
<br/>
Back:<br/>
Figure I will keep my Lizardscale Cloak: (AC 8 + 5 to Dexterity), at level<br/>
17 I did comedy standup (died once, lizzies do NOT get social commentary<br/>
humor) for about 2 hours at Cazic Zone until someone sold me it for 80pp. I<br/>
think I made a third of that banking at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Chest:<br/>
I still have a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic: (AC 12, +8 to heat, cold and magic<br/>
protection.) which frankly is still nice for pulling with it&#39;s resists..but<br/>
that AC hit is hurting...so, not having 1kpp for a Brigandine Tunic (and<br/>
however much for a Mithril) I am thinking Steel Breastplate (AC 17)<br/>
<br/>
Face:<br/>
Until my dream of a Mask of Deception dreams come true I am going to stick<br/>
with my bronze mask, I don&#39;t see a huge benefit to steel<br/>
<br/>
Feet:<br/>
Of course I would love Dwarven Work Boots: (AC 8 STR+3, DEX+5) but though I<br/>
have no idea what they go for I am guessing it is too rich for my blood, so<br/>
Steel Boots (AC 8) seems the thing.<br/>
<br/>
Hands:<br/>
Gah, I love my Elf Hide Gloves (I checked, it is no one I know :o) (AC 4. +5<br/>
desterity, +5 Agility) but if I can keep my dex and agi above 100 I am going<br/>
to go for Plate gauntlets (AC 9), or, I suppose, if they don&#39;t cost a<br/>
fortune Shin Gauntlets ( AC 7. +5 poison)<br/>
<br/>
Head:<br/>
I have a Blackened Iron Crown (AC 5. +5 Strength, and +5 each to poison,<br/>
fire, cold, disease and magic resistances) but am thinking I would start<br/>
saving for the (Crested Helm: AC 10. +6 st, +3 char) or at least a Fine Silk<br/>
Turban (AC 10, SV Fire +10) though, and I know this places me in the extreme<br/>
minority, I *like* the Bird-Head look of a metal helm on a Wood Elf. There<br/>
is also a Griffon Helm (AC 10. +9 str, +5 agil).<br/>
<br/>
Legs:<br/>
I am thinking of keeping my Barbed Legplates (AC 8. +2 Agility) until I can<br/>
get Silver-Plated Leggings (AC 10. +3 strength, +5 agility)<br/>
<br/>
Neck:<br/>
Ack, finally goingto give up that Spiked Collar (AC 3. +3 to Strength) and<br/>
go with a Steel Collar (AC 6)<br/>
<br/>
Shoulders:<br/>
Love the Bloodstained Mantle: (AC 6. +3 to strength, +10 magic protection)<br/>
and I am rueing the day I sold the Crested Spaulders (AC 11, +6 stamina) I<br/>
had bought for *80pp* of a hurried fellow in Freeport bank.<br/>
<br/>
Waist:<br/>
Sticking with the Thick Leather Apron(AC 8), at 26 I figure the Thick Banded<br/>
Belt:(AC 8, +15 strength) is a looong way away.<br/>
<br/>
Wrist:<br/>
I have one Silver Plated Bracers (AC 7 +5 disease resistance, +5 poison<br/>
resistance) I figure I need another. No real contenders here...<br/>
<br/>
Weapons:<br/>
Finally, to replace my Dragoon Dirk I will start looking for an Obsidian<br/>
Shard (Damage 6, Delay 25, Effect of Obsidian Shatter)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With jewlery this should dramatically raise my AC and keep my stats all<br/>
around 100. Am I correct in thinking that this is the best approach at 26?<br/>
Any hints on prices would be greatly appreciated, and would make a lot of<br/>
people on Povar happy because I wouldn&#39;t keep offering to trade them a 350pp<br/>
item for a 1-2Kpp item *laughs* criminy that is embarassing :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any replies, I greatly appreciate it.<br/>

P.S. Has there ever been any sort of mention why at level 26 you get both<br/>
Screech and Instill Doubt? Was it just bad planning and they figured the<br/>
lesser of all evils was to give them at the same level? Seems odd...</div>
