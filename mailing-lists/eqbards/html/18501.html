<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705661162">we get the same thing on our server, as i am sure every &quot;uber-guild&quot; (stupid<br/>
term) does on their respective servers.  i don&#39;t think anyone is quite as<br/>
large or has quite the attitude that FoH apparently does though.  i think<br/>
they have 300 or so members, so they can really take over a large portion of<br/>
the high level game from other players.  we have about 65 members or so, and<br/>
we can do dragons and planes at our leisure as well, but we work very well<br/>
with the other guilds on the server capable of doing these.  i don&#39;t believe<br/>
that is the case with FoH.  i have no first-hand experience but from what i<br/>
hear they deserve their rep, but i guess only those who have dealt with them<br/>
personally can know.<br/>

ok bragging time, we killed Venril Sathir first =b<br/>

&gt; boards.  I just think its funny that people get so upset when <br/>
&gt; a group of<br/>
&gt; people want to play a game differently they do.  I believe a lot of it<br/>
&gt; is jealousy, which is very sad. </span></blockquote></div>
