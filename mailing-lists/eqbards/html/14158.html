<div id="ygrps-yiv-737189097">My UV seems to work just find with the *old* mask doing just what you&#39;re<br/>
doing - fighting Bouncers inside Oggok.  I don&#39;t remember my songs ever<br/>
ending the UV effect.<br/>
<br/>
One point I&#39;d like to make is that I&#39;ve been using those vendors in Oggok a<br/>
lot lately, and if you sneak behind them and buy/sell your prices are a lot<br/>
better than as a DE, although sneaking is less convenient.  I&#39;m the group&#39;s<br/>
designated looter, I loot every Bouncer until my AGI starts dropping (with a<br/>
Shaman in the group no less, heh) and then sell and /split.  Therefore, the<br/>
price difference of 1pp per Long Sword adds up over the course of the night.<br/>
