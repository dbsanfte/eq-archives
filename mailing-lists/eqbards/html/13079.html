&gt; It may be that two bards singing Lullaby (one continuously<br/>
&gt; and the other weaving it in) negated the problem of mobs<br/>
&gt; still attacking after the initial resist.  Even if a mob<br/>
&gt; resisted my song the first time, he still had to resist<br/>
&gt; the other bards song. I think it also helped that my<br/>
&gt; charisma was 149 and the other bards was 145 (with<br/>
&gt; sympathetic aura buff).  All I can say is that last night<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  Two bards singing this is about as good as an<br/>
enchanter&#39;s AE mesmerize.  I tried writing up a message<br/>
detailing this, but I couldn&#39;t come up with an explanation why<br/>
it&#39;d be so much more effective.  Now that we know the song<br/>
only lasts one pulse, it makes perfect sense.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious though why you thought the enchanter wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
able to AE mes.  Most enchanters I know just cast AE mes again<br/>
before the mobs wake up from the previous one.  If something<br/>
starts attacking the enchanter, taunt/charm it off him and go<br/>
back to work.  (Although in this case it probably wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have worked because the enchanter would&#39;ve been OOM before you<br/>
killed everything.)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, bard + enchanter + AE mes is a good combo.  The biggeest<br/>
problem I&#39;ve run across with AE mes in tight quarters<br/>
(dungeons) is that the enchanter will sometimes mes himself,<br/>
and as the mobs wake up, the s#!t hits the fan.  I can<br/>
attribute 4 of my deaths to this.  After the 4th I started<br/>
keeping Pixie Strike or charm memorized even when grouped with<br/>
an enchanter.  If you keep everyone&#39;s resists up, the<br/>
enchanter can cast AE mes at will and will almost never mes<br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
Do not underestimate the importance of charisma too.  My<br/>
normal chr is 154.  I had a really tough time controlling<br/>
stilleto fang piranhas in Kedge (red at 42) with Pixie -<br/>
they&#39;d resist maybe 70%-80% of the time.  My shaman friend put<br/>
sympathetic aura on me bumping me up to 184, and all of a<br/>
sudden my Strikes were sticking about 2/3rds the time.  I got<br/>
so carried away I started weaving another song with it instead<br/>
of just Striking the fang.<br/>
