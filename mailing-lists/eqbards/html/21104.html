<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313438226">There actually was a second and he took lament like a champ.  Both were<br/>
yellow to me at 38 so comfortably above the 28(it was 28 right) charm<br/>
cap.  That was my original plan too, head that way and charm giants,<br/>
let them beat the smack out of eachother and soak up xp.  Unfortunately<br/>
the ones there con&#39;d higher and after a guild event I decided to give<br/>
up on leveling for the moment and try to get a Shrunken Gobskull<br/>
earring and a Berserker Club.  My new project.. *sigh*<br/>
