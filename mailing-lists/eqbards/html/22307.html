<div id="ygrps-yiv-481283180">Ok, had a chance to quiz GZ on the songs this weekend at eqfest 2000 in<br/>
Houston, TX.<br/>
<br/>
Pixe and such, are being/have been changed, during the patches that are<br/>
going live...he wasn&#39;t specific on it.<br/>
<br/>
LULLABYE WILL BE CHANGED!<br/>
<br/>
GZ: &quot;Look for some VERY interesting things to be happening to Lullaby soon&quot;<br/>
GZ: &quot;We have been thinking about bard mez, we didn&#39;t want them to infringe<br/>
on the Enchanter role, as that is what Enchanters do best, BUT we don&#39;t<br/>
think that giving bards some mez abilities will hurt&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These are not exact quotes, but pretty close.<br/>

p.s. One helluva weekend, even if it felt like being in the Karana&#39;s.<br/>
EQFest 2000 was a blast!<br/>
Check out eq.stratics.com and watch the official eq site for news!<br/>
Thanks Ron!<br/>

&gt; Well, supposedly no.  However the spdat.eff file did get patched last<br/>
&gt; weekend when I logged in.  They can also change some spell effects in the<br/>
&gt; database without taking the servers down.  I think this might actually<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; gone in with the last patch and may have either been unintentional, or<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; may be trying it out to see if they see any unbalancing effects from it<br/>
&gt; being live before they announce that it is live.  That way if they have to<br/>
&gt; change it fewer people will notice.<br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t think the server I am on (E&#39;ci) has gone down for the scheduled<br/>
server<br/>
&gt; maintenance Abashi mentioned.  Haven&#39;t noticed any downloaded files<br/>
either.<br/>
&gt; Kitasi and I play on the same server so thats why I was wondering if the<br/>
&gt; patch went in unannounced.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Has the patch that will improve Pixie Strike, Song of Twilight and nerf<br/>
&gt; &gt;Jonthan&#39;s Provocation even gone in yet? I was under the impression that<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt;wouldn&#39;t go in until sometime next week.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; has either your server gone down or have you downloaded any new files?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; if not, then it is impossible.<br/>
