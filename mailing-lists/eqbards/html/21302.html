<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Alright - it&#39;s Offtopic, but I&#39;ll respond.  According to this month&#39;s PC <br/>
&gt;Gamer, they now have several companies looking at publishing them.  Things <br/>
&gt;are looking up for David.  I must admit, I owe him an apology - I never <br/>
&gt;really thought he&#39;d get this far, based on the performance of his <br/>
&gt;less-than-stellar game &quot;Demise&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Talies the Wanderer<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interestingly we talked about the demise of Demise at the convention last<br/>
weekend.  David openly admitted that the screwups on Demise were mostly his<br/>
fault, partly for trying to do everything himself, and partly from thinking<br/>
he knew what made a good game more than the players who were interested in<br/>
it did (sound like anyone else we know?).  Apparently Demise has been handed<br/>
off to someone else to repair.<br/>
<br/>
That was the biggest lesson David said he learned from Demise, that it was<br/>
better to get good people to do pieces of the game even though they might<br/>
have a different opinion of what was good than he did.  They are currently<br/>
in the process of hiring an economist to finalize the details of the money<br/>
system for Horizons because they do not fell that any of the dev team knows<br/>
enough about how economics work in different scales to get it right.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;d certainly appreciate your wisdom on the game if you get involved<br/>
with it in the future Talies, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone.  I don&#39;t always<br/>
agree with you, but you do always prompt me to think about stuff.<br/>
