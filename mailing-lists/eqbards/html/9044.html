<b>Subject:</b> Imbrued platemail - a defect? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-319663795">Just a minor rant on the lack of ac on Imbrued platemail. I honestly<br/>
believe some kind mistake was made.<br/>
<br/>
The warrior-only platemail from PoF is ac 36. Ok, cool, warriors are the<br/>
ultimate tanks, they deserve that much ac.<br/>
The ac on the Paladin-only and SK-only breastplates is 30. They&#39;re<br/>
hybrid classes, so its understandable why they&#39;d have less ac than<br/>
warriors.<br/>
The ac on the cleric-only breastplate is 28. Clerics arent designed to<br/>
tank (at higher levels, mind you), so they dont need as much ac as a<br/>
natural plate-wearing, tanking class. Understood, no problems there.<br/>
The ac on the ranger-only breastplate (and i suspect the same for<br/>
rogues) is 26. Why 26 and not 30, since rangers are hybrids/tanks?<br/>
Well.. (this is the key point to my rant) rangers are natural chain<br/>
wearers. Meaning Verant from the start designed rangers to have less ac<br/>
than their hybrid counterparts, thus they limited them to wearing chain<br/>
mail, not plate. They *can* wear plate of course, but only *magic*<br/>
plate.<br/>
So why am I ranting and raving you ask?<br/>
The ac on the bard-only breastplate is 26. Same as a ranger, who was<br/>
designed to have less ac than the typical plate-wearing classes. The<br/>
bard however, was not designed that way. We are a natural plate-wearing<br/>
class so that we can have higher ac to make up for our lack of defensive<br/>
skills, or whatever Verant had in mind when they created the class.<br/>
Now look back.. clerics, who are not a tanking class, (much like bards),<br/>
have 28 ac on their breastplate. I would expect the same, if not better,<br/>
on the imbrued breastplate since we are a fellow plate-wearing class<br/>
that wasnt designed to be tanking. (At higher levels, mind you). So why<br/>
are bards penalized I ask?<br/>
I think there&#39;s a chance that an error was made. It seems the ac on each<br/>
piece of our armor is the same of rangers/rogues who although are melee<br/>
classes, they are also natural chain wearers, who were desgined by<br/>
Verant to have *less* ac than any type of plate-wearing class, not<br/>
*equal* ac.<br/>
Now to clarify a few things.. this isnt a bash against rangers to get<br/>
them nerfed. This isnt a bash against clerics to get them nerfed. This<br/>
isnt a discussion about a bard&#39;s role in a group. This is not a<br/>
discussion about anything other than the AC on the class specific armor.<br/>
And if you think my case is just is only limited to the breastplate, it<br/>
is not.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some more examples: (When I say &#39;Chain wearers,&#39; I&#39;m referring<br/>
to Rangers/Rogues/Shaman).<br/>
Cleric-only greaves: ac 15. Bard-only greaves: ac 14. Chain wearers-only<br/>
greaves: ac-14.<br/>
Cleric-only vambraces: ac 15. Bard-only vambraces: ac 13. Chain<br/>
wearers-only vambraces: ac 13.<br/>
Cleric-only boots: ac 15. Bard-only boots: ac 14. Chain wearers-only<br/>
boots: ac 14.<br/>
I can list more and more pieces, but you get the point.<br/>
It is my belief that bards deserve to have as much, if not more, ac than<br/>
a cleric.  The fact that we do not, boggles me.<br/>
<br/>
Now unfortunately I&#39;m not aware of the proper way to bring this to the<br/>
attention of the dev team. So please, let me know how. Or, if you also<br/>
agree with me that this is a mistake, and you do know how to bring this<br/>
to the attention to the dev team, please go on ahead and do so. It&#39;d be<br/>
a great favor.<br/>

PS: Our lambent greaves (which require killing lvl 30ish mobs): ac 14.<br/>
Our Imbrued greaves (which require killing lvl 45+ mobs): ac 14.<br/>
