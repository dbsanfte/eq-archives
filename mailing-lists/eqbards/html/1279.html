&gt; the way back, their bard (around level 18) used the lullaby to sleep 4 ghouls <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lullaby works fine in dungeons (there&#39;s nothing different<br/>
about how it works when above or below ground).  The problem<br/>
is if you get in over your head above ground, you can always<br/>
run away.  If that happens underground, you&#39;d better hope your<br/>
group has good healers because you are going to take a beating<br/>
until you kill everything or you zone.<br/>
<br/>
I used it in Crushbone today to pull a legionnaire train off<br/>
of another player (I&#39;m at the point where I can solo these<br/>
easily and they are all green or blue to me).  Someone else<br/>
took one, and I was left with two.  I kept the lullaby going<br/>
to keep one asleep while I dispatched the other.  We both<br/>
finished about the same time, and I was more interested in<br/>
healing than experience so I let the other guy kill the final<br/>
legionnaire.  I never touched that legionnaire, but it was so<br/>
mad at me for putting it to sleep for so long that it *never*<br/>
attacked the guy who was hacking at it.  It kept attacking me<br/>
right up until it died, even though the only thing I was doing<br/>
was playing my healing song (solo no less).<br/>
