<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139617295">I should have known by the no-introduction &quot;X has invited you into a group<br/>
click FOLLOW..&quot; thing, but when I saw it was a bard in Lambent I<br/>
thought...okay, why not,two bards can be fun,  I can always leave. Turns out<br/>
he was the leader of the Raider group...perfect. Well the second heads up<br/>
was that he was using a PGT and barbed whip at 30, but hey, sometimes people<br/>
just like a certain combo. It was when he said &quot;I will sing Hymn and Jig&quot; I<br/>
thought &quot;uh oh.&quot; But I really wanted a group...I died shortly thereafter,<br/>
however the rest of the evening went smoothly. BTW, his name makes it on the<br/>
silly name list but I think I better not mention it :o)<br/>
Anyway, Highpass strikes me as clockwork exp, spawn is 14 minutes (from<br/>
first gobby to first gobby, 3 total) and when you get a group that can<br/>
handle it you just kill/wait/kill/wait. I suppost that is what it is like in<br/>
campsites all over Norrath, I have just never played the game that way, I<br/>
think I can stand it for a few nights though, then I will have to go find<br/>
something dangerous again...(my guild calls me DangerBard or<br/>
DangerEnchanter, depending on who I am playing, I just like hunting<br/>
someplace I am KOS or that has some other challenge than waiting between<br/>
spawns).<br/>
So, that is the Highpass report for today. We shall see what tomorrow<br/>
brings.<br/>
