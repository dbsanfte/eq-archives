<div id="ygrps-yiv-23831075">Yikes!  I thought the animated version was ok, but certainly not of that<br/>
caliber.  Gandalf is being played by Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto from X-Men),<br/>
Liv Tyler plays Arwen, Sean Bean (Sharpe of the Sharpe&#39;s series) plays<br/>
Boromir, Elijah Wood plays Frodo, Samwise is played by the Sean Astin<br/>
(Rudy), Saruman is played by Christopher Lee, Bilbo by Ian Holm, Gimli by<br/>
John Rys-Davies, Galadriel by Cate Blanchett, Wormtongue by Brad Dourif.<br/>
The cast alone makes this an immense undertaking.  Throw in the fact that it<br/>
will be three movies, one for each book in the trilogy and I think it will<br/>
be very exciting.  more info available at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tolkienonline.com/">http://www.tolkienonline.com/</a><br/>

It doesn&#39;t matter, it would be like so one remaking the white album, (or<br/>
redoing Psycho, say...)<br/>
<br/>
I found the animated movie to be nearly perfect (I really love it that<br/>
much).  Computer generated monsters will never be as scary as the Ring<br/>
Wraiths were.  What are the chances whoever is playing Gandalf (anyone have<br/>
a cast list yet) is as much of a bastard as he was in the animated version?<br/>
And somehow I can&#39;t see being Mini Me (I forgot his real name) being as<br/>
appealing as Pippen was...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see and again I hope I&#39;m wrong :-)<br/>
