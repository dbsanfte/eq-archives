  and the product needs to be handed over to a deserving bard.<br/>

  Perhaps, we could work out a subquest for you.  Maybe run<br/>
  some errands for me, pickup a few items I&#39;ve been looking<br/>
  for.  I believe I have spare BP components laying around.<br/>
  Footing a 250pp bill for jewels is asking a lot from a L20<br/>
  person, so I can cover the cost in return for your services.<br/>
