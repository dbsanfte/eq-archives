&gt; even go for a bracer for a few levels. Bronze been berry berry good to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve got a lot of lambent quest items, which need to be fused<br/>
  and the product needs to be handed over to a deserving bard.<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps, we could work out a subquest for you.  Maybe run<br/>
  some errands for me, pickup a few items I&#39;ve been looking<br/>
  for.  I believe I have spare BP components laying around.<br/>
  Footing a 250pp bill for jewels is asking a lot from a L20<br/>
  person, so I can cover the cost in return for your services.<br/>
