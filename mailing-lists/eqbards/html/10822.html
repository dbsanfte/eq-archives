<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098016222"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Bilge in the Cauldron has been seen once on our server.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve tried and tried to find him, and I&#39;ve killed every goblin<br/>
  in the zone to make something happen.  Word is he is another 8 hour<br/>
  spawn.  I&#39;m not certain how the mob tables work for spawns like<br/>
  him, since I don&#39;t know who his placeholder is or where the spawn<br/>
  point is.  It&#39;s really hard to say.  I stayed around for 3 hours,<br/>
  wasted my time actually.  Needless to say, I got 5 cauldron shells<br/>
  and around 15 water rings hehe. (well, noobs got them)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I remember wandering the caves of everfrost for 5 friggin hours.  Talk<br/>
  about boring.  I did ever little trick I heard to make that stupid <br/>
  bear spawn.  (Another rumored 8 hour spawn)  Well, everything short<br/>
  of killing Sulon Mcmoor.  Killed the ice goblin divers over and over,<br/>
  killed all of the stationary ice bones.  Someone said there was a <br/>
  roaming ice bone near the entrance and that it was the bear place-<br/>
  holder.  Yet, I never once saw a roaming skeleton.  Most shamans<br/>
  said they found the bear near the entrance, however.  I found the<br/>
  big zero, and left with a stack of bones, and a few copper.<br/>
<br/>
  I think instead of jumping on a rare as soon as I see it from now<br/>
  on, I will instead study it&#39;s movement patterns and actions.  And<br/>
  if I lose it or it vanishes, it will at least give more insight<br/>
  into these super rare spawns.  Waiting around doing nothing is<br/>
  a bitch.  I mean it&#39;s one thing when X mob spawns every 20 mins<br/>
  and has a random chance of being the named one.  It&#39;s a whole<br/>
  &#39;nother story when a ultrarare named roaming spawn with chance<br/>
  of a placeholder is introduced.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s like that fisherman with the fishbone earing.  Or the oracle.<br/>
  Or Karg Icebear.  No matter what they would always spawn at their<br/>
  regular intervals.  There might be a placeholder but every 6 hours, a<br/>
  wizard would gate in for the next 1/10 shot at the earring.  Every<br/>
  7-8 hours, a druid would gate in to kite Karg for GZ.  At least<br/>
  you had a shot at the thing you wanted, and you knew when to expect<br/>
  it.  Having a monster placeholder for a spawn that is 8 hours is<br/>
  absoultely ridiculous.  I don&#39;t envy clerics/shaman.<br/>
