<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237893813">I noticed it when text wrapping first went in.  Though it does seem to be<br/>
happening more since the patch to fix the delay when swapping screens<br/>
lately.  But no, it&#39;s not new and it&#39;s definitely not unique to Bards.  I<br/>
get it on all of my characters on 2 different accounts.<br/>
<br/>
People on Saryrn are talking about it on our message boards as well.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve seen this problem for about a week or so.  Other people I&#39;ve grouped<br/>
&gt; with have said they have seen this problem before - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; strictly bard or bard-grouping related.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think the repeat switching works for me - but I&#39;ll give it a<br/>
try...<br/>

&gt; I noticed this too, this morning.  Something must have happened overnight,<br/>
&gt; because everything was fine when I was playing last night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I found that switching back and forth a couple of times brought the<br/>
history<br/>
&gt; back.<br/>
