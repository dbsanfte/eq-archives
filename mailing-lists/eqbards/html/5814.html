<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-370654870">Ah see I think I understand now.  Please understand that when I said &quot;Cool,<br/>
very cool.&quot; I was completely refering to the story about Lord Nagafen.  I&#39;m<br/>
sorry if that was confusing.  I can see how that could appear to be a spam<br/>
message referring to my signature file below.  I had just read the story and<br/>
was on my way out the door yesterday when I left the post.  I will try to<br/>
take my time with my post a be more elaberate from now on.  Thanks for<br/>
helping my understand the confusion.<br/>
