I was in Erudin over the weekend, heading to the library to get some songs<br/>
when I saw something that caught my eye.  A sign on the Paladin guild that<br/>
says, &quot;Deepwater Knights.  Followers of Prexuz&quot;.  It was spelled with a &quot;z&quot;<br/>
not an &quot;s&quot;.  It is possible that you MAY be taking a faction hit against<br/>
them *shrugs*.  I know if you kill the fish in the paladin/cleric pool in<br/>
Qeynos you take a faction hit against their god Rodcet Nife.  This does<br/>
make you KoS with the paladins and clerics in Qeynos.  All I can say is<br/>
zone in to Erudin, con some paladins and leave.<br/>

&gt;Hello there guys =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been soloing NPCs from Kerra Island (the Catman people) for a while.<br/>
&gt;They are really, really good exp at 18th lvl, not hard to solo, non<br/>
&gt;carters, some of them spanw alone, fast spanw rate (no more than 5minutes)<br/>
&gt;and a decent loot (around 4gp plus a skin worth 2gp). Then while I heal up,<br/>
&gt;I kill willowisps to get a couple GLS.<br/>
&gt;The only point that has been tricking me is about the faction hit...<br/>
&gt;I have been getting a bad faction hit with &quot;Prexuz&quot;. That made me wonder...<br/>
&gt;Who is Prexuz? (note that Prexus, the Ocean Lord, is spelled with &quot;s&quot;,<br/>
&gt;while the faction hits PrexuZ).<br/>
&gt;If anyone knows anything about this plz let me know<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ericka, the sexyest bardess on Prexus.<br/>
