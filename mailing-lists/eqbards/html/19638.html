You should have /petitioned the person that trained you and then /reported<br/>
his comment about training you because you didn&#39;t help him.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s flagrant abuse and should be punished.<br/>

<br/>
Last night I fired up my &#39;puter to persue my favorite pasttime, Everquest<br/>
(bet ya didn&#39;t see that coming!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m camped out in the windmill of the lake of ill omen, so I shout once for<br/>
a group, and then proceed to wander of to the skelly ruins.  There&#39;s a group<br/>
of 2 rangers and shaman there whacking on things and the shaman spots me.<br/>
He runs over and asks if I&#39;m grouped.  Since I&#39;m not yet, I join them in<br/>
their destruction of the undead in the area.  Things proceed nicely.<br/>
Everyone is happy to have a bard and are thoroughly impressed with the<br/>
increase in effectiveness of the group, but then one of the rangers decides<br/>
to leave.<br/>
<br/>
We figure we&#39;ll still be ok and I pull out my claw and silvery axe instead<br/>
of my dual gnoll hide lariats which I was using before.  Things continue to<br/>
be good until the shaman decides to pull a skelly and two come.  Of course,<br/>
this valley has lots of wanderers, so we pick up two wanderers also.  The<br/>
ranger peels off one mob while I start tanking (ack!) one of the skellys<br/>
(and one of the wanderers of course) and the shaman blasts the other skelly<br/>
to oblivion.  Things are looking bad as I get down to a little less than two<br/>
bubs, so I flip on Selo&#39;s and start running circles around the group while<br/>
they finish off another mob.  The shaman and ranger med and heal while I<br/>
keep the last two mobs busy running in circles.  Then we manage to polish<br/>
everything off.  This was really nice.  Both the shaman and ranger were duly<br/>
impressed, but then the ranger and shaman both had to camp out.<br/>
<br/>
Things have been going great this night, so I decide to look for another<br/>
group, and find a rogue to partner up with.  We move over to the back<br/>
entrace of the Sarnak fortress, and I use lament to pull one of the two<br/>
sarnaks at the entrance.  We proceed to demolish this recruit (I love<br/>
rogues!).  And continue to pull a couple more singles.  Things are still<br/>
going great, we&#39;re finishing up another recruit when another player runs out<br/>
of the fortress and starts yelling for help.  We proceed to finish our fight<br/>
and just as this recruit dies, bam, we get trained by a sarnak adherent and<br/>
pet.  I get nailed by a darkness spell and end up dying.<br/>
<br/>
I proceed to remem my songs, grab a spare drum and truck it back to my<br/>
corpse.  The rogue asks the other player why he trained us and his response<br/>
was that since we didn&#39;t help us, he figured we should go down with him.  I<br/>
was floored.  We were already engaged, and he thought we should turn to help<br/>
him???  I guess I should have logged off sooner. :(<br/>
