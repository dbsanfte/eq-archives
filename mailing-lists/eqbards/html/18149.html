Musta been the Tunare list that this came up on.  Anyway, when it was first<br/>
posted the whole thing sounded like a joke, so the fact that they were<br/>
supposed to be 8&#39; tall as opposed to 8&quot; tall only made the thread last<br/>
longer.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I know this IS real, I&#39;m a bit surprised about the size range.  6&quot;<br/>
to 8&quot;?  A gnome to an ogre ought to be more of a range than that, nevermind<br/>
some of the baddies.  Oh well, guess I stick to shooting elastic bands at<br/>
those little green army guys.  ;^)<br/>
