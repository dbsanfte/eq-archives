&gt; A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the world.<br/>

use for invisibility and said &quot;Try this.&quot;  Well the graphic looked like the<br/>
Wooden Flute graphic so I equipped it and it did in fact work as a wind<br/>
instrument.  I don&#39;t have a clue where the bard got the Raw Bamboo, and it<br/>
had no bonuses or effects.<br/>
