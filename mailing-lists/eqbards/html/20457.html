<div id="ygrps-yiv-169892088">I think I&#39;ve used Pixie Strike all of once due to the feedback given <br/>
from this list.  I die enough as it is, I&#39;m not particulary open to <br/>
testing something out under fire that I&#39;m almost certain is gonna <br/>
fail. :)  Lullaby, I use to powerlevel my girlfriend&#39;s twink and <br/>
that&#39;s about it.  And I don&#39;t imagine that working so well when she <br/>
gets to around 30 or so...<br/>
<br/>
I almost exclusively use charm to do crowd control.  If I&#39;m the main <br/>
crowd controller (i.e. no enchanter) I can usually effectively handle <br/>
a 3 pull... put your pet on the 3rd mob and they&#39;ll beat each other <br/>
up for awhile... But, you need a cleric to keep you alive with 2 mobs <br/>
beating on you during resists or mis-timed recharms.  I&#39;ve been in a <br/>
few parties where the paladin would taunt the 2nd, move out of range <br/>
and root it... Frustrated me trying to get my pet to attack while he <br/>
was rooted, but a pretty effective method nonetheless.  If there&#39;s 4 <br/>
and I don&#39;t think the group can handle at least 2 beating down the <br/>
tanks at once, then it&#39;s time to call ZONE before you even get into <br/>
the fight.  Hell, have the puller zone it off the bat. :)  I plan <br/>
excursions to Sebilis/Chardok, etc. around a cleric and/or enchanter <br/>
(no way I&#39;m going anywhere tough without at least one), so it&#39;s just <br/>
pick up groups I have to worry about.  Karnor&#39;s is the prime spot for <br/>
pickup groups on my server and luckily, the zone is close to most of <br/>
the camp spots. :)<br/>
