into/out of water.  Before, when I had a cyclops chasing me in<br/>
the OOT, I&#39;d run over the water (levitated), it would chase me<br/>
and disappear underwater.  Now, I&#39;ll run over the water, and<br/>
it&#39;ll sort of wade through, never actually dropping below the<br/>
water&#39;s surface.<br/>
