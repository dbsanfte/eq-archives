<div id="ygrps-yiv-223214983">Since the patch that allows clipping range to be adjusted, I have been<br/>
seeing this....<br/>
<br/>
(well ok I have been seeing this a lot in the past 2 weeks becus I been solo<br/>
in SK instead of grouped in dungeons)<br/>
<br/>
I can see and target an Avo (say for example but any mob does this) - I run<br/>
to it and it vanishes - I was tracking it so I follow tracking and its says<br/>
&quot;straight ahead&quot; so I keep going.  Then something happens and they &quot;pop&quot;<br/>
back into view.  <br/>
<br/>
So I wonder if the extended viewing range has changed our perspective on<br/>
&quot;how far away&quot; things are and thus the perceived range of bellow?<br/>

			I&#39;m not too sure about that.  It may just be that<br/>
things look screwy<br/>
		when fighting clops/giants.  I know that I can melee them<br/>
while standing<br/>
		much farther back than I ever could Dervishes.  It seems<br/>
like it might be<br/>
		the same physical range, but since the clops/giants are so<br/>
much larger, and<br/>
		have a larger melee range, it makes it seem like you&#39;re<br/>
closer to them than<br/>
		to the dervishes.  If you remember, try running back to a<br/>
dervish camp, and<br/>
		see how it compares.  Or I&#39;ll try tonight or tomorrow.<br/>
