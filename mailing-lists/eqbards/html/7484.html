<div id="ygrps-yiv-282953470">true but it has obviously been a small percentage of your actual playing<br/>
time as evidenced by your levels.  Your lowest level character probably has<br/>
more playing time than my highest.  Dying for me doesn&#39;t just mean running<br/>
across some zones and back to playing.  It often means running across some<br/>
zones and quitting for the night.  Might as well be like that old MUD<br/>
Immortal where dying prevented you from playing till the next day.  Now that<br/>
would be a painful penalty for many people, but for me no different really<br/>
than the current one.<br/>

i&#39;ve completely lost where this discussion is going.  i advocate the<br/>
non-binding side of the discussion, meaning for me when i die i have less<br/>
time to as you say gain levels and exp, but that means that&#39;s all i care<br/>
about?  i don&#39;t think dying is fun, i don&#39;t think running naked is fun.<br/>
it&#39;s not supposed to be, that is my point.  apparently dying is such a<br/>
traumatizing experience for you.  running across a few zones is an<br/>
incredible hardship.  i&#39;ve done it a million times, and i still don&#39;t want<br/>
to be able to bind.<br/>

&gt; Definitely Agreed!  Still I can&#39;t figure out why people think <br/>
&gt; running naked<br/>
&gt; accross the world to you body is more fun than regaining exp <br/>
&gt; you had fun<br/>
&gt; getting the first time just so you don&#39;t get set back in some <br/>
&gt; bizarre got to<br/>
&gt; get to the next level plan.  What&#39;s up with that?  Does <br/>
&gt; anyone understand<br/>
&gt; that at all and can explain it logically?  I mean you had fun <br/>
&gt; getting those<br/>
&gt; xp the first time.  You get to get them all over again and <br/>
&gt; have fun again?<br/>
&gt; Unless you let thsi get out of control by not taking <br/>
&gt; unreasonable risks,<br/>
&gt; wait I thought that was the whole point of a death penalty?, <br/>
&gt; there shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be a problem.  Unless of course playing isn&#39;t fun, only going <br/>
&gt; up levels is<br/>
&gt; fun.  Of course at that point running naked to get your <br/>
&gt; corpse still isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; fun because while you are doing that you aren&#39;t going up levels. </span></blockquote></div>
