<div id="ygrps-yiv-86620484">Whooop !!! I spent several hours last night making macros from socials<br/>
and testing them. Ortez [sp?], the green orc in S Ro that heals himself<br/>
makes and excellent test subject BTW. Here is what I found with examples<br/>
listed below.<br/>
  1. The shortest delay with my equipment and my DSL connection I could<br/>
get was for all practical purposes      was 30.<br/>
     I might get as low as 28, but start &quot;losing&quot; songs out of the<br/>
rotation when they don&#39;t have time to get <br/>
     up.<br/>
<br/>
  2. The &quot;/stopsong&quot; command is essential and takes up an entire line by<br/>
itself. This has a limiting effect on how many songs your can<br/>
practically use. TWO. You CAN make a macro to sing 3 songs but the last<br/>
song will stay on and you will have to stop it manually. ....Well, there<br/>
is a way around it but if you don&#39;t have excellent timing you either get<br/>
the &quot;Chat screen shivers&quot; , when it shakes telling you you have<br/>
conflicting commands trying to be processed or the first song seems to<br/>
drop out of the rotation. My attempt at a single 3 song macro looks like<br/>
this. Resist messages did not stop the macro for continuing. Missed<br/>
notes MAY HAVE messed up the timing though... I do know that if I missed<br/>
a note the macro continued but the timing seemed thrown off enough that<br/>
the following song had trouble coming up. Not sure about this yet but<br/>
the solution was easy. Wait and hit the macro again to resynch.<br/>
<br/>
 3SNG (Macro name, 3 song)<br/>
/stopsong (to stop the last macro or song that is presumable still going<br/>
on)<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 3 (Fufils)<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 4 (Chant of Cold)<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/cast 4 (Chant of Flame) Note.. no pause line needed.. it just plays on<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 3. Suddenly last night I was able to twist FOUR songs 80 percent of the<br/>
time ! Never been able to do that with my machine before ! I think this<br/>
is because Macros remove any Keying errors and inefficiencies in timing<br/>
from my twisting :) The trick here was to set up 2 macros of 2 songs<br/>
each.... Run Song and 3 Chants. Run song might flicker but often the<br/>
icon would just stay up. I tried putting in a line like /say Hit it<br/>
again Sam ! as a visual indicator a macro was done but found that it<br/>
just took time away and you knew from the Icon greying/light when a<br/>
macro was finished.<br/>
<br/>
BTL 1 (Label for &quot;Battle song 1 macro)     <br/>
/pause 30, /cast 8 (run song)              <br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 3 (Fufils chant)<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
<br/>
BTL 2 (name of second macro)<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 4 (Chant of Cold)<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 5 (Chant of Fire)<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
<br/>
 4. They most popular use of the new macro will be the Run/Levitation<br/>
combination. You CAN keep the Tracking screen UP !!! using a macro<br/>
similar to the one below. Note, Lev FIRST (just in case) and the line to<br/>
give yourself a visual signal in the chat window the macro is done. I<br/>
found I had at lest 12 seconds grace before having to refresh the macro<br/>
if I got distracted. (Why do I feel that unless I want invisibility, I<br/>
am not going to be using the level 51 Selo&#39;s Song of Travel much ?)<br/>
<br/>
FlyMe (Macro name)<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 6 (Levitation. Put first because I don&#39;t want my teeth<br/>
jarred :)<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 8 (Run song)<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/say Fly Me ! (Chat Screen visual cue for when tracking screen covers<br/>
your song icons)<br/>
<br/>
 5. I also made Macros combining Heal Song, Mana Song and Niv&#39;s so I can<br/>
keep Mana up while healing the party which reduces keystrokes. <br/>
 6. I found that &quot;/pause 30&quot; on a line by itself MAY be required if your<br/>
mixing Cast and Say type commands in some situations. The &quot;/pause 30&quot;<br/>
line ALWAYS has to be the first statement of a line even though it is<br/>
executed after the second statement. Whenever I tried to make a line<br/>
with more than 2 statements in it I got garbage. This should be further<br/>
investigated to be sure. Might just be me :)<br/>
 7. Finally, if you want to switch songs between battles, say to drop<br/>
out a chant for a Heat shield, a simple right click on the icon brings<br/>
up the macro and you only have to retype one line.<br/>
<br/>
 I am sure more sophisticated programmers out there can come up with<br/>
better Macros :) but I hope this will help you get started.</div>
