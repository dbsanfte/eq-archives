&gt; &gt; hoping at level 29 they won&#39;t aggro on me anymore, but not <br/>
&gt; sure. I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t aggro on level 30&#39;s. Too bad, seems like such a <br/>
&gt; good place for<br/>
&gt; &gt; exp and items at my level, but I can&#39;t make it to any of <br/>
&gt; the good rooms. So<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll have to con everything and see if something is not <br/>
&gt; indifferent to<br/>
&gt; &gt; you. Anything not indifferent will jump you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Nope, heh.  These little pricks still find it in their <br/>
&gt; heart to attack<br/>
&gt;   me anytime they see me.  You will never be high enough <br/>
&gt; level for these<br/>
&gt;   twerps not to attack, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Strange. Then why don&#39;t they aggro on other invis level 30&#39;s that I&#39;ve<br/>
travelled with. They&#39;re always baffled as to why these things aggro on me<br/>
and not them, or is this just a hate thing? *shrug*<br/>
