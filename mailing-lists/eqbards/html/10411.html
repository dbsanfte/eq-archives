<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845174856">I honestly think they should cap us at 255, even though the difference would <br/>
probaly be negligable realistically now that our songs 40+ songs don&#39;t <br/>
constantly miss notes. Melee and casters maxed at 255 still miss attacks and <br/>
fizzle spells, and we would certainly miss notes.<br/>
<br/>
I just think a 255 cap is not unreasonable because we are the only class <br/>
with the ability to use song. I don&#39;t think it would unbalance us because <br/>
the only comparison is to a caster fizzling, which happens often enough. I <br/>
can understand giving a rogue a melee skill cap of 255 to compensate for the <br/>
lack of hp/ac that a warrior has so why not cap bards at 255 when we are <br/>
lacking in EVERY other skill by design?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I also think we deserve Parry as a skill. =)<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t even come close to unbalancing us. Seriously - what swordsman <br/>
would learn the DIFFICULT ability to wield two weapons, but never learn how <br/>
to deflect incoming attacks? Parrying is an essential, basic skill for ANY <br/>
swordsman/fencer.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the petition - I had thought Shada said there was a petition with <br/>
skill capping as one of the items to fix. I was corrected. I know there have <br/>
been petitions and letters sent to GZ and such, but I haven&#39;t really <br/>
participated in any of them as of yet. Normally I just feedback any opinions <br/>
i have on the game, but even as a write one I feel like I&#39;m wasting my time. <br/>
If anyone has a current petition why don&#39;t you add the skill cap and ask <br/>
parry to be added to bards on it. =)<br/>

&gt;however, even though our skill caps remain, as of a recent patch a couple<br/>
&gt;weeks ago, i very rarely miss notes on the high level songs now.  not sure<br/>
&gt;how they went about fixing that but it is definitely fixed.  i had much too<br/>
&gt;difficult a time twisting verses of victory with anything from all the<br/>
&gt;missed notes, which i no longer have.  but just the increase in<br/>
&gt;effectiveness of our songs, as pure casters and priests increase their<br/>
&gt;effectiveness of spells all the way to level 50, seems appropriate.  as is<br/>
&gt;said though, i can see how if they considered us hybrids, that our casting<br/>
&gt;abilities like the other hybrids should cap at 200.  it would be nice,<br/>
&gt;considering our primary attributes are our songs over melee (unlike SHD,<br/>
&gt;RNG, PAL) that our caps would be in line with the pure casters and priests,<br/>
&gt;whose primary attributes are their spells.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was particularly annoyed at this too, and, I think it&#39;s the main<br/>
&gt; &gt; reason we miss so many notes on our 40+ songs.  I have a feeling the<br/>
&gt; &gt; code tests against Level x 5 + 5 for the skill check and doesn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; &gt; allowances for the skill cap. It seems the logical explanation for why<br/>
&gt; &gt; our 40+ songs are so hard to start.<br/>
