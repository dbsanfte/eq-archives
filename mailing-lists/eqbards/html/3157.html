<b>Subject:</b> New term for twisting <br/>
<br/><br/>

    My apologies if anyone takes this personally, but, I think &quot;Juggling&quot; and &quot;Weaving&quot; are just as bad (well maybe slightly less so) than &quot;Twisting&quot;.  I&#39;m not a clown; I&#39;m not a textile worker as well as not being a gymnast.  I&#39;m a musician.<br/>
<br/>
    The term I like: &quot;Riffing&quot;...  It seems to me - that we are playing five or six seconds of a song - so it would basically just be a riff...  Musically speaking, of course, &quot;riffs&quot; are associated more with instrumental music than vocal music - but I think it fits a hell of a lot better than twisting, juggling, weaving, or heaven-forbid &quot;medlying&quot;<br/>
