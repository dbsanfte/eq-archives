<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-935090718">Hmm, while it&#39;s fun to group with 50&#39;s (and 40&#39;s) - you can forget about xp.<br/>
First off the mobs can be too red for you to get xp when the group kills<br/>
them and if they are not too red and there are lots of higher lev&#39;s - they<br/>
will get the lion&#39;s share of xp and you will get little.  My group got ahead<br/>
of me - I was 35 and they were 42 to 44 and were killing things yellow and<br/>
red to me and my xp was so slow it was incredible.  Had they been 37-39 it<br/>
would have been real different - still killing red mobs but more equal xp<br/>
distribution.<br/>
<br/>
They want you because they see you as a mana stone.  I&#39;d say forget about<br/>
any offense songs in battle - maybe try CoD if you want to weave something<br/>
in.  Play the buff songs that stack.  Anthem, elemental or purity, guardian<br/>
- use a drum - do you have MM drums? When you have the MR buffs stacked make<br/>
sure you have them check their MR you will here stuff like &quot;holy moly MR 130<br/>
woo hoo!&quot; and esp if someone else has MR buffed the party.  Also, they will<br/>
resist the fear and such - really fun to see this in Kith where the mob use<br/>
so much magic and melee hard too.<br/>
<br/>
If MR is not much of a factor, go for melee buffs. Chant and Celerity (hmm<br/>
you don&#39;t get that til 36?) will stack and with a drum be a great buff for<br/>
tanks.  Don&#39;t use chains unless they ask you.  They prolly have a better<br/>
snare/root available and if the mobs are &quot;much high&quot; you will get resisted<br/>
anyways.  Jig might be good also, and yes others can Sta buff better but<br/>
that takes mana to cast - so jig might save some mana for other stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
The other problem with going against mobs that are &quot;much higher&quot; than you is<br/>
that you don&#39;t have the hp to sustain hits.  Even when you are in groups<br/>
that are closer to your level and you go to hard spots, you wont have hp to<br/>
sustain a zone run.  I was in a group and we left the frenzy place in Old<br/>
Guk and since we had a good night and thought we were real smart we decided<br/>
to &quot;have a look see...&quot; (famous last words I know.)  Well, we were standin<br/>
in the middle of the jail when the ranger&#39;s camo faded and he got jumped.<br/>
Then all frog broke loose.  Our enchanter got off 2 casts of her AE mez and<br/>
10 froggies were mezzed and 10 more were still attacking.  Panic set in and<br/>
some one or two called for a zone run.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s all fine and dandy if you can cast Divine Aura and know the way<br/>
out.  Me and the enchanter died not too far down the tunnel from the jail.<br/>
And the 3 tank types got out. Some said it was the hugest train they ever<br/>
saw.  In retrospect, we should not have fled.  Even though there were like<br/>
15 froggies - they all green and we had good crowd control and a good<br/>
healer.  We should have stood and fought em one by one. <br/>
<br/>
So, my point is - play what works: you can buff your team lots better than<br/>
you can de-buff or dmg the mobs.  Also, have your insurance paid up.<br/>
<br/>
Also do not play songs when the puller is out.  Keep your eye on the puller<br/>
and when he starts to go pull - stop songs until he gets back.  This is<br/>
supposed to keep from the mobs he agro&#39;s from getting you on the hate list<br/>
right away and also help him not agro lower level mobs he runs by.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the heal song while in battle is supposedly a huge taunt (supposedly<br/>
each point you heal counts the same as a point of damage against the mob -<br/>
so they hate you for it and although they don&#39;t take damage it taunts them<br/>
to you and you get hit.)  You will be lots more like a caster - low HP -<br/>
marginal contribution to melee and a mob magnet.  They (your hi lev party)<br/>
think you are a mana stone and want you for that and wont like you dieing so<br/>
stay out of combat and buff & MR buff them in combat.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I can hear it now - &quot;bards are supposed to lead the team, control<br/>
the battle, call the shots&quot; -- but not if you are the baby bard and these<br/>
guys are 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s.  And even if they are &quot;wrong&quot; - they are the high<br/>
lev&#39;s and prolly wont listen to your advice - even if you are right. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to be more of a team leader, you need a team more equal to your<br/>
level.  When you are all about the same age, they will listen more and be<br/>
able to try stuff with you. Also, you will shine more because more of your<br/>
stuff works.  You can pixie and it works, you can charm to taunt mobs off<br/>
your caster and it works. You can use DD and DoT&#39;s and they work (well as<br/>
they work as good as they can anyway.)<br/>

<br/>
		Now that the high-level members of my guild have decided to<br/>
acknowledge <br/>
		my existence (at level 33 - now 34 - I could get exp with<br/>
the 50s), I am <br/>
		wondering what, exactly, I should be singing when I am in<br/>
places where <br/>
		the MOBs are MUCH higher level than I am?</div>
