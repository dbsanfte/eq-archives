&gt; 	No, they cancel each other out.  Fire and Cold based ones<br/>

&gt; thorns and cooling subtracted instead of stacked.<br/>

to&quot; subtract.  Just like Lullaby is &quot;supposed to&quot; have a<br/>
resist rate &lt;35% for me against L46 mobs.  I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
surprised if in fixing the druid thing, Verant &quot;broke&quot; it so<br/>
that these two now stack.<br/>
