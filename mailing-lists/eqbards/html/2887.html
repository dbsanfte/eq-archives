<div id="ygrps-yiv-352657909">I have to disagree.  Verant in their ultimate wisdom have added flocks of<br/>
spectres to Oasis.  They sweep down the coastline faster than anyone can run<br/>
and kill dozens of players in one or two hits.  They are impossible to<br/>
escape and impossible it anticipate.<br/>
<br/>
I will never go to Oasis again until I am high enough level to kill<br/>
spectres.  It is futile going there to kill crocs, you lose exp faster than<br/>
you gain it.   I was killed  three times in two hours...the last time I was<br/>
just trying to get the H out of there and they nailed me ten feet from the<br/>
zone line.<br/>

I would have to say the oasis. Solo anything blue and your exp will be<br/>
great. I made lvl&#39;s 15-19 in 5 days there.</div>
