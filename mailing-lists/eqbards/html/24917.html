<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894285186">That&#39;s why the payment for JumJum damages quest guy was changed to be a<br/>
deputy in Misty Thicket long ago.  Someone on this list at the time trained<br/>
the original target right over next to the quest giver in Rivervale and<br/>
stood there just hailing the two and doing the quest thousands of times.<br/>
Some Guide saw what was happening and they fixed that the very next patch.<br/>

ssshh, although that&#39;s being creative with game mechanics, some powers that<br/>
be would call that exploiting 8)<br/>
<br/>
a little creativity never hurt anyone though<br/>

There is another faction type quest and you dont have to zone, taking some<br/>
soup up to near the marshal but I forget both party&#39;s in the quest.  It is a<br/>
very very short run though sometimes you can run fast enough  the door on<br/>
the bank doesnt close before you have another bowl of soup.  Although I did<br/>
train the girl a little closer to the bank door before I started doing the<br/>
quest.<br/>

Last I checked that quest, the NPC will only give the turnips to low level<br/>
characters.  Do it early if you want the faction from it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;actually, there&#39;s a quest you can do really quick with selo&#39;s or sow in<br/>
&gt;rivervale (no zoning), the turnip delivery quest, I got a druid to 11 doing<br/>
&gt;it on test server once, he was very very warmly when i stopped doing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You have to get ungodly good faction with GuardiansoftheVale, which you can<br/>
<br/>
&gt;gain by killing Goblins, Mooto and Deathfist Orcs; and by turning belts in <br/>
&gt;to Deputy Budo, and goblin warbeads in to Sheriff Roglio.  My Halfling <br/>
