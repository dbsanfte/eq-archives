&gt; What&#39;s going on here is that you cannot &quot;see&quot; her.  If you tried hailing her<br/>

sort of tavern, and a lot of people like to sell to the<br/>
merchant there.  The mail delivery quest guy is behind the<br/>
counter there so I usually end up selling to the merchant from<br/>
behind the counter.  I tried Carillion once and got no<br/>
message.  Hmm, odd.  I moved to the side a bit.  Still no<br/>
message.  After moving around some more, I figured out that<br/>
the area the merchant is standing in is slightly recessed.  <br/>
If you are not standing in the recessed area, that is you are<br/>
standing one step up, you are at a sufficiently different<br/>
Z-axis level that you cannot cast on nor talk to the merchant!<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s even more wonderful is that we have this restriction in<br/>
combat, whereas mobs do not.  If you&#39;re fighting on a slope,<br/>
you have to stand *very* close to the mob to be able to hit<br/>
it, while the mob can hit you fine.<br/>
