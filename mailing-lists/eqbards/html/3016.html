<div id="ygrps-yiv-986215837"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One thing I forgot to mention.  Since it takes less time to<br/>
&gt; stop and restart a song than waiting for it to pulse, you<br/>
&gt; could in theory heal your group faster if you were to stop and<br/>
&gt; restart Restoration every time it pulsed, instead of just<br/>
&gt; letting it play and waiting for the next pulse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Incorrect actually. Restoration is not a healing song, but rather a song<br/>
that increases HP regen. It, like all other bard songs, lasts for 10 seconds<br/>
from it&#39;s start. It does not heal on the pulse, the pulse just happens to be<br/>
when HPs are updated. So starting and stopping Restoration does nothing to<br/>
increase it&#39;s effect.<br/>
<br/>
What this does mean is twisting Restoration is a very viable option:<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s consider low levels where Restoration without a stringed instrument<br/>
increases the HP regen rate of a standing character from 1 HP a pulse to 3<br/>
HPs a pulse. Greg the Warrior and Peter the Bard are in a group. Greg the<br/>
Warrior has 150 HPs total. He takes damage down to 110 HPs. Peter the Bard<br/>
twists as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Restoration, Anthem, Elemental (who knows why these three). Let&#39;s imagine<br/>
Greg the Warrior is not taking any new damage during the combat.<br/>
<br/>
Pulse 1 (with Restoration): Greg&#39;s HPs 113<br/>
Pulse 2 (with Anthem): Greg&#39;s HPs 116<br/>
Pulse 3 (with Elemental): Greg&#39;s HPs 119<br/>
Pulse 4 (back to Restoration): Greg&#39;s HPs 122<br/>
Pulse 5 (with Anthem): Greg&#39;s HPs 125<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Greg the Warrior&#39;s HPs continue to go up without needing a &quot;pulse&quot; of<br/>
Restoration because Restoration is not a healing song, but a HPs regen rate<br/>
increase song.</div>
