<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865306811"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Again, you are looking at this as a competition. So what if it&#39;s crowded? I<br/>
&gt;&gt; hunt what I can, when I can - if someone else gets it, oh well. Mobs are<br/>
&gt;&gt; good little trains - another is along every X min. like clockwork. If an<br/>
&gt;&gt; area is so massively crowded that I can&#39;t move - I just log - or find<br/>
&gt;&gt; somewhere else to hunt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is self-contradictory.  On the one hand, you say &quot;so what<br/>
&gt;if it&#39;s crowded?&quot;  On the other you say if it&#39;s too crowded,<br/>
&gt;you just logout.  If your attitude towards it is &quot;so what,&quot;<br/>
&gt;then why do you logout?  You are trying to claim this isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt;problem, when your actions clearly indicate you feel it can<br/>
&gt;be enough of a problem for you not to play the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a condition - while a problem - it is not one attributable to PEOPLE. <br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem with too many folks in an area isn&#39;t nothing to hunt -<br/>
or having to grab a mob before someone else does - it&#39;s simply a matter of<br/>
lag. Lag is based (for me at least) solely on the amount of activity going<br/>
on and mobiles (including players) in an area. I don&#39;t consider this a<br/>
matter of competition - it&#39;s just a fact given the current state of<br/>
technology and primarily my connection. It has nadda to do with who is<br/>
there - obviously if a zone is so crowded I constantly crash - or can&#39;t<br/>
move - that IS a problem - but not something I attribute to other people.<br/>
They have as much right to be there as I do, while I could think of several<br/>
ways to handle this a bit better - I don&#39;t blame it on other folks - and<br/>
what they may or may not have.</div>
