<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712986949">Since this most recent patch, has anyone else (with the clickable boots) been having levitate fade with either 1 red warning message or sometimes no red warning messages?  I know for sure that there used to be 2 red warning messages giving me enough time to re-click my boots, but now I can hardly if ever react fast enough to do it and end up falling often.  I don&#39;t have a caster character with levitate though so I can&#39;t check if its the same for them, but for my bard this is a very annoying change =(<br/>
