&gt; 2. Perhaps there is a way - and I just missed it, do we ever get to weild<br/>
&gt; one weapon and an instrument?  I could have sworn I saw a higher level bard<br/>
&gt; doing just this once, but could never get it to equip. I figured I might be<br/>

like you&#39;re wielding a 2-handed weapon and a shield at the<br/>
same time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. Autorun is almost as bad, I have to find a button on my keyboard, and<br/>
&gt; quite often - where I am is so twisty - you just run into things and the<br/>
&gt; mob has you, if you aren&#39;t constantly navigating with the mouse. Like most<br/>
&gt; folks, I&#39;m right-handed, trying to find things with your left hand on the<br/>
&gt; RIGHT side of your keyboard isn&#39;t the easiest thing to do, especially when<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Autorun has been on my &#39;r&#39; key since a week after I got this<br/>
game.  I&#39;m telling you folks, remap all your movement and<br/>
other important keys to the left side of the keyboard.  Your<br/>
left hand will never leave its home position, your right hand<br/>
will never leave the mouse.  It makes things a *lot* easier.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5. Why oh WHY are some critters so hard to target? I&#39;ll be in unrest - 2<br/>
&gt; darkbones banging on my crew - a deeth beetle at my feet - and the dam<br/>
&gt; deeth beetle is the only thing I can manage to target? I try to use assist,<br/>
&gt; but it seems very, very buggy - more than half the time - it just doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work. Is there some reason that F8 couldn&#39;t CYCLE thru the nearest mob&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; instead of only the one IT thinks is closest?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would be nice if F8 had some smart filtering so you could,<br/>
say, turn off auto-targeting of things that are green or red<br/>
to you.  (My F8 key is remapped to &#39;q&#39; by the way, attack is<br/>
caps lock, which makes it pretty simple to target and attack.)<br/>
<br/>
Wait&#39;ll you try to target fae drakes.  Some of them you can&#39;t<br/>
even target with F8.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6. I truly wish there was a quicker way to loot your own corpse - right<br/>
&gt; clicking drops it into your inventory instead of putting it on your body. I<br/>
&gt; think a check should be made of whether you can wear an item first, drop it<br/>
&gt; there, THEN drop anything else into your backpack. Be a simple matter - all<br/>
&gt; your worn gear is always at the top first anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like it the way it is.  If it were quicker and automated<br/>
like you suggest, then I&#39;d be advocating time delays to<br/>
put/take off armor/weapons/instruments.<br/>
