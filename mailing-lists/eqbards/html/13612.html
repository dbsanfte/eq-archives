&gt; &gt;Also, dispite what GZ said about pixie strike not being broken, it looks<br/>
&gt; &gt;like they may have changed it recently. Our guild bard wanted to duel my<br/>
&gt; &gt;druid while we were standing around last week after the patch and he<br/>
&gt; &gt;basically locked me up with pixie strike. I wasn&#39;t able to move once if<br/>
&gt; &gt;I got the message and icon. This is considerably different from my tests<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the song months ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pixie Strike WAS changed.  It used to not have the MR reduction effect.  <br/>
&gt; When it was a straight mez/stun song it was much more effective.  The MR <br/>
&gt; debuff introduced the dreaded double save.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is in direct contradiction to my tests last August when it was in<br/>
fact less effective, giving bogus success messages yet the supposedly<br/>
mez&#39;d PC could still move and attack most times. That was before both<br/>
the MR addition and the PvP nerfs to magic.<br/>
