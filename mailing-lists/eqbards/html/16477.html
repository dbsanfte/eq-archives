 </span></blockquote>A bind song (assuming we are talking bind affinity) would further blur<br/>
distinctions between the classes, and I strongly believe that what is needed<br/>
in EQ is /more/ distinctions between the classes, not less. I have been<br/>
against it from the start.<br/>
<br/>
I sure wouldn&#39;t mind a controlable melifluous melody, one that would take<br/>
you in the direction you wanted to go, to a distance that was determined by<br/>
level (or blocking object).  It could even be mana based so that you<br/>
couldn&#39;t use it in place of selos. If it were group you could use it like a<br/>
mini-evac (in outdoor places) just to get you free of the mob.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and while I am on the local teleporting topic, I understand why<br/>
Melifluous motion shouldn&#39;t take you through walls, but if those walls are<br/>
something that a person could get over with levitate (like the Hermit&#39;s<br/>
walls in South Karana) I think you should be able to do it, heh, I just want<br/>
an evac from that freakin gnoll...<br/>
