<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292155946">My guild did 3 quest pieces in about a week:  ranger legs, an enchanter piece,<br/>
and I think a paladin bracer.  They aren&#39;t common that&#39;s true.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My guild has farmed Plane of Gimps to the point where they are bored - and<br/>
&gt; we got a pile of loots.  Even folks who didn&#39;t want the factions came in to<br/>
&gt; loot after everyone else who fought and took faction hits got loots. We<br/>
&gt; tried to kill giants and get the corroded stuff but it never dropped (we got<br/>
&gt; one set of boots made iirc.) Look on the spoiler sites and you see that no<br/>
&gt; quested armor items are getting reported - it&#39;s far easier to kill stuff in<br/>
&gt; PoG.<br/>
