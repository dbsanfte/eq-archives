<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hmm, does this mean my cleric friend (who picked up a gypsy<br/>
&gt; lute when I wasn&#39;t there) could give the lute to the NPC, and<br/>
&gt; I could give the NPC the carapace and ruby lambent, and I<br/>
&gt; would get the breastplate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do I really want to try this experiment considering it took me<br/>
&gt; 3 days to get that damn carapace?  Anyone know of a similar,<br/>
&gt; easier quest we could test this theory on first?<br/>

RIGHT after the other - but i would definitely test it first just to be<br/>
certain!! No sense wasting all that time spent!! Good Luck!!!!<br/>
