<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140635489">Spud, you have quite clearly outlined all the reasons I am NOT renewing my<br/>
EQ subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed - had I known that what little else there was to do would be<br/>
destroyed so soon - I&#39;d have never wasted my money in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
As a class, I too love my bard - but I hold Verant responsible for false<br/>
advertising. EQ is NOT a virtual world, it&#39;s a very pretty Quake - at least<br/>
now.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Give me a noncombatant role any day of the week.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I think overall as a class - MOST bards - at least those well suited to the<br/>
&gt;&gt;role have matured past having to be the center of attention and HERO of the<br/>
&gt;&gt;day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Uh... In EQ there really isn&#39;t much non combat (Trade Skills), and what<br/>
&gt;minor features the game provides in that area are in need of a huge ammount<br/>
&gt;of work.  In short, if you like non combat EverQuest just isn&#39;t for you.  I<br/>
&gt;would never want to give anything away just for a skill where I target an<br/>
&gt;NPC or get within a certain distance and press a button, get a few copper if<br/>
&gt;you are successful or nothing if you fail, and then do it over and over and<br/>
&gt;over and over again.  At least combat is a little more complex then that,<br/>
&gt;even if a bard is a twitch character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bards are the true jack of all trades in EQ, and I LOVE that.  I don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;have downtime compared to my other classes!  Forget meditating for five to<br/>
&gt;ten minutes after a fight, I am a bard.  :)  I get to run fast, wear armor,<br/>
&gt;get weapons, duel weild, cast spells in the form of songs, have  a very<br/>
&gt;diverse list of song abilities, and to top it all off I get tracking!  We<br/>
&gt;get some of everything.  We may not be masters at any on thing, but boy is<br/>
&gt;it fun to do so much!<br/>
