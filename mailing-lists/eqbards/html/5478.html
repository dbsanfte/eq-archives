<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728626984">bastige!  I hope you rot in level Hell 30 for a good two to three days! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WTG on 30 Harm!!  You cant make money if you are so bz power levvving.  You<br/>
need to travel around and spend all your time in tells.  Fiting mobs really<br/>
slows down the money making and deal doing.  Once you get a decent amount of<br/>
capital and make some fiends with players who let you sell their stuffs and<br/>
if you like doing it - you can really roll thru the plats.<br/>
<br/>
I have sold easily over 2000pp worth of stuffs in the past 2 weeks.  The<br/>
FBR&#39;s and Golden Black pearl Chokers go for lotsa plat.  The 200pp stuffs<br/>
are mid levels.  But nabbing a dirk or combine here and selling it there is<br/>
bread and butter 30 to pp trades.<br/>
<br/>
My weapon collection now includes:<br/>
(in no particular order)<br/>
combine long slasher<br/>
dragoon dirk<br/>
screaming mace (with 1hb at 7 kinda sucks)<br/>
polish garnet tommychopper<br/>
ashenwood short stabber<br/>
barbed leather whip<br/>
ten-tickle whip (I love to beam smiles :-)<br/>
combine scim (have not tried this one yet)<br/>
crookstinger<br/>
chrys knife (I think - maybe sold it)<br/>
cracked dark wood shield (any one know if this can be repaired?)<br/>
bronze 2h sword (who knows I may give to a warrior)<br/>
fine steel dagger? (maybe just bronze - in my emergency road kit)<br/>
kite shield<br/>
wood shield (it was my first one and I just kept it)<br/>
<br/>
normally I keep a stock of giant snake fangs on hand for young bards I meet<br/>
- need to replenish my inv.  Still looking for some of the more rare daggers<br/>
- pugious & jamybia. <br/>

		Topic was why did Harmonic chide Sylly for 50pp and Estella<br/>
		for 75pp for elfhide gloves.<br/>
<br/>
		1) When you are level 19 (which I was) you don&#39;t just throw <br/>
		   out 50pp or more on something like that.  Hell, you are<br/>
<br/>
		   lucky to make 25pp on a hard working night.<br/>
		Don&#39;t play me off as some cheap bastard like I was 11 levels<br/>
ago,<br/>
		when I was lucky to make 10pp a night.  I&#39;m pulling down<br/>
around<br/>
		50pp a night or so and I&#39;m happy as a clam to spend my<br/>
money. =)<br/>
