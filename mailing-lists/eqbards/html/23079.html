I don&#39;t mean to offend here, but any group that goes to Kedge relying on our<br/>
aquatic ayre is one can short of a six-pack.<br/>
<br/>
Rebreathers, Fishbone Earrings and the like are definitely the order of the<br/>
day.  Also, if you can get your hands on some Singing Steel Gauntlets, you<br/>
can eliminate the Ayre, irrespective of level.<br/>
<br/>
Just because we get a water breathing song, doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re set for<br/>
Kedge.  It&#39;s hard enough down there twisting songs in battle and staying<br/>
alive.  Add to that the necessity to twist Ayre and you&#39;ll have a very<br/>
difficult time.<br/>

What should be the actions if I were to go LD?  Should they just camp, log<br/>
an alt, and wait until I show up?  heh...just a thought.<br/>
