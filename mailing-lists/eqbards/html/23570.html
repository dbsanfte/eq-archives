&gt;plug.  I swapped it so that 2 of the 3 fans are on the other reliable power<br/>
&gt;plug and that the third fan is on the faulty one (it goes on and off).<br/>
&gt;Since i&#39;ve fixed all my fans the pc has yet to hang, and i&#39;ve done a couple<br/>
&gt;of 4-5 hours sprints of gaming and everything is ok woot.  No upgrading just<br/>
