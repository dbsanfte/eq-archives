Your compliant is noted.  On that note (heheh) here&#39;s a thought for you:   <br/>
Playing a bard isn&#39;t for everyone.  You might be happier playing a different class.<br/>

My complaint is that the boring span is longer than any other caster at that<br/>
level range. Intcasters get three sets of useful spells during that boring<br/>
span, wiscasters two, and even with hybrids they get spells at nine, then<br/>
fifteen, then twenty two, never having to go eight levels without anything useful.<br/>
