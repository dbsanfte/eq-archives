To each their own.  We all pay to play so we all have the right to play<br/>
however we want within the RULES of the game.  If it aint against the rules<br/>
then nobody has a right to tell you your way of playing is wrong, whichever<br/>
way that might be.<br/>

&gt; It all lies in what you want out of the game.  Unfortunatly in your (and<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure lots of people&#39;s, since I hear this all the time) veiw, what others<br/>
&gt; players have/do affect your enjoyment.  (And I don&#39;t mean directly as in<br/>
&gt; training half a dungeon on your head, but rather indirectly in that you<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to feel price in your accomplishments and feel your accomplisments are<br/>
&gt; lessened when others achieve them.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other people have different veiws (in this case they just wish to have the<br/>
&gt; items/experience of being on the planes/whatever).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The unfortunate part is their veiw conflicts with yours (and again, I dont<br/>
&gt; mean to point at YOU but rather you as a group who share similar veiws).<br/>
&gt; Theres not much that can be done about this, as both groups of people have<br/>
&gt; the right to play the game.  You (and your comrades) know how you got your<br/>
&gt; planar gear, let that be enough.<br/>
