&gt; a HQ bear skin I&#39;d looted.  Look to get a combine weapon as soon as you can.<br/>
&gt; No idea how much they cost as I can never find a vendor selling one. (grrr)<br/>

  heh.  FS rapier    = 5pp value to player.<br/>
        HQ bear skin = 20pp-30pp value to tailor.<br/>
<br/>
  look to spend between 50-70pp for 1h combine weapons.<br/>
  <br/>
  North Karana gypsy camp down the road from the wizard spires is a good<br/>
  place.  Just keep an eye out for Grimfeather.<br/>
<br/>
  However in the age of a mature server, you should be looking for<br/>
  a dragoon dirk (10pp-30pp) which have better stats than any combine<br/>
  weapon does.<br/>
