Those are the sort of annoying bugs that Verant should just fix and get it<br/>
over with, like strumming your flute when you should be playing your drum.<br/>
They&#39;re small things that make the game look shabby and frayed around the<br/>
edges, or, as with the Hide bug, make the skill very dangerous and random<br/>
to use.<br/>
