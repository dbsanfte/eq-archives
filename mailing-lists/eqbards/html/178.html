<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489681284">When you say &#39;VERY much sped up&#39; are you referring to some time in Beta or<br/>
currently? Someone I know who was a 35th level bard in Beta said 7 and 10<br/>
were broken and would give tremendous speed when played together but they<br/>
have been &#39;fixed&#39; to not double on the attack speed.<br/>

The Anthem is much better, since it increases your attack speed.  The<br/>
effect is subtle, but it is definately there, believe me.  It also<br/>
stacks with Jonthan&#39;s Warsong, so your attack speed is VERY much sped<br/>
up, and your strength increases by a huge amount.  I play these two<br/>
songs when soloing even now at level 17.  (And even higher with my high<br/>
level bard in Beta).<br/>
