the only limiting factor to this song is mana.  you don&#39;t need it memorized<br/>
during the time that you are getting that mana back.  blow it off, demem it<br/>
and put something else in while you regain mana.  from what i have seen on<br/>
boards like backstage, it sounds like bards never do any form of crowd control<br/>
in a group with an enchanter unless the enchanter dies or is getting beat on<br/>
after someone breaks mez or mez gets resisted.  so in that case, you are not<br/>
playing to your full potential (assuming you aren&#39;t gonna charm) if you sit there with<br/>
a full mana bar.<br/>
<br/>
it is actually of LESS use to me than most other folks because i usually play with<br/>
enchanters who recognize that charm is a huge bonus to party damage and are<br/>
good enough enchanters not to get confused when i say &#39;&#39;charming %T&#39;&#39;.</div>
