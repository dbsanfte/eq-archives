<b>Subject:</b> Utility of Lullaby and Invisibility songs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346294655">I&#39;m only 14th level and with deadlines for my graduate thesis quickly<br/>
approaching, it may be a long time before I get the chance to discover the<br/>
answer to these questions for myself so I&#39;m gonna go ahead and ask them now.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows the bard is #1 on the hit list for enemy creatures.  In my<br/>
most recent skirmishes with the Dervish Cutthroats, I continually found<br/>
myself taking the brunt of the damage even though there were tanks in the<br/>
group.  Even when I tried to back up and quit attacking due to low health<br/>
the cutthroats continued to attack me even though I was doing no damage to<br/>
them.  The end result is that I ended up dying a couple of times when other<br/>
members of my group ended up taking either zero or little damage in the<br/>
fight.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that when I gain the ability to sing the Lullaby and<br/>
Invisibility song my survivability rate will vastly improve.  Here is how I<br/>
assume they work so would like confirmation if my assumptions are correct.<br/>
<br/>
For the Lullaby, if I am getting attacked by more than one creature, I<br/>
assume that I will be able to sing the Lullaby while in combat, put them to<br/>
sleep, and then either attack them one at a time or gain enough time so I<br/>
can safely run away (I know this is cowardly but hey in the end you got to<br/>
look out for your own well-being:-)  <br/>
<br/>
For the Invisibility song, I assume that if I turn off the AutoAttack, start<br/>
singing the song, then I and the rest of the party will become invisible.<br/>
Party members who continue to attack the creatures will become visible upon<br/>
their next attack.  If I continue to sing the song and never attack again, I<br/>
assume that I will be safe for the duration of the combat.  This all assumes<br/>
that the creatures I am fighting can&#39;t detect invisibility.  Also, if I am<br/>
singing the Invisibility song and not attacking the creatures, and then<br/>
start twisting a song that benefits the party like Hymn or Anthem, will I<br/>
stay invisible.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
