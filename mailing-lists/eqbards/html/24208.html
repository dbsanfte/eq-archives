<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235129423">If DDD was usable say once per battle and gave me some taunt factor I might<br/>
start meming it once I&#39;m out of the CC business. Currently when we aren&#39;t in<br/>
WW playing dragon tag, I do CC for exp fighting in HS. We don&#39;t always have<br/>
a chanter when exp grouping and so I get the job. I&#39;m realy going to miss<br/>
being able to do CC! Of course I&#39;d actually have to gain exp instead of<br/>
slowly losing it for that to become an issue! Dragon lewt is very worth the<br/>
exp bleed though.<br/>
 My biggest problem now is with the new cleric hate, (which is very similar<br/>
to the way the much denied bard hate used to be), I have no good way to peel<br/>
mobs off the cleric. Our normal group is me and a monk for tanks with a<br/>
cleric, druid, shaman, and another caster type. We almost never have a<br/>
taunting class with us. As it works now, the cleric is a dead man as soon as<br/>
he heals one of us. We just stopped playing our mains except for WW runs<br/>
because of it. We have found this new hate to be an excellent twink tool.<br/>
Park the cleric beside our band of 40some twinks, cast one heal on the<br/>
ranger or monk during battle and the mob goes for the cleric exclusively<br/>
while we kill it. I&#39;m the wizard during this, and I can put over 900 points<br/>
of damage into something, the cleric heals one of the tanks for less than<br/>
that and the mob goes straight for the cleric, not me.<br/>
 BTW I actually felt needed in WW last night. I was doing the resist song<br/>
twist instead of meleeing and the other groups without a bard after the<br/>
second fight started asking what we were doing, what our MR was. etc. Next<br/>
battle my tanks are saying &quot;SING!!!&quot; instead of INC! Escorpa silences, that<br/>
bites!<br/>
 I thought I read we get an upgraded Fear song that also SoW&#39;s the mobs<br/>
after 50. Of course I may be dreaming that.<br/>
