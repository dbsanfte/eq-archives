&gt; too many blows to the head that you have forgotten? Or is it because you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have that nice head piece you wanted so badly a couple months ago<br/>
&gt; &lt;grins&gt; to protect your noggin?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  hehe.  Yeah I still owe you something for that, hmmm.  I gave<br/>
  my last one away =(  But I&#39;ll get one from Sog or drag myself<br/>
  into the throne room for another.  Can you send me a list of<br/>
  some other things you were looking for privately?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;d sure like to try that axe and see if it&#39;s better than my St-o-Wr.  Esp<br/>
&gt; dual wielded with the Staff instead of my Dirk.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Is it better than SWA, hmm..<br/>
<br/>
  Silvery War Axe,   6/22<br/>
  Staff of Writhing, 9/33 proc 48 dmg.<br/>
<br/>
  (floor(6 * (37/10)) + 1) every (22/10) seconds = 10.45 dmg/sec<br/>
  (floor(9 * (37/10)) + 1) every (33/10) seconds = 10.30 dmg/sec (+ proc)<br/>
<br/>
  The ratio is ever so slightly better, plus I think the staff <br/>
  looks silly on a bard.  But that said, the proc aint bad at all.<br/>
  I use one for practice only, now that I&#39;m 200 1hb I really don&#39;t<br/>
  need to practice with it anymore, since 1hb is not the most<br/>
  powerful weapon class we can use for the time being.  But for the<br/>
  final decision, I dunno - axe for looks?  staff for slight dmg<br/>
  increase, pending the proc goes off enough?  Maybe axe for casters <br/>
  to interrupt them more? I dunno.<br/>

  too. <br/>
