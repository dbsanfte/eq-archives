&gt;Where does charred plate come from?  I keep hearing about it, but never see<br/>
&gt;any info on where it is located or how hard it is to get?<br/>

I t comes from Sol a off a rare clockwork spawn that also drops the charred<br/>
shield the druids are nuts about, I think it was an exg model...looked like<br/>
a giant doll. Also available are charred gloves n boots in the same dungeon<br/>
off the captain kobold spawn near the fireplace room (boots common drop<br/>
gloves rare). Be aware you will get BAD faction hits with gnomes if you go<br/>
for the BP. Also need to melee the clockwork. I was lucky..we weren&#39;t<br/>
camping it on purpose..not for a BP..we were after a shield for a druid. Not<br/>
sure if theres more pieces out there..if i get any will post.</div>
