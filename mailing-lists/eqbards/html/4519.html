<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143460596"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; seems of it being able to &quot;break out&quot; of a song effect.  My<br/>
&gt; only real gripe about this is that it&#39;s possible for a mob to<br/>
&gt; immediately break out of an effect.  That doesn&#39;t make sense<br/>
&gt; to me because that&#39;s what the initial resist check is for.  <br/>
&gt; If it didn&#39;t resist, then it should suffer the effect for at<br/>
&gt; least one tick, not 0.1 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t seem fair to me either, but it&#39;s the same problem with roots.<br/>
Wizards whine about how bad their roots are, well, with my druid&#39;s roots<br/>
there&#39;s a check for root resist, a check for dmg resist (meaning about 70%<br/>
resist rate on blues), THEN half the time it doesn&#39;t &#39;stick&#39;, meaning the<br/>
effect seems to wearoff immediately and the mob never stops moving.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, it&#39;s not just unique to bard songs. =)<br/>
