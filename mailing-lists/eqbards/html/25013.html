<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066003817">I twist 3.  Always 3.  I&#39;ve experimented with 4, but the first one always<br/>
lapses by the time you get to it again, not to mention, it&#39;s just that much<br/>
harder that it makes it too much like work.  :)  I&#39;m still playing to enjoy.<br/>
Naturally, I get the paladin in my group who also has a bard who is level<br/>
(range is usually 25-45), who can twist 4 songs even through lag spikes<br/>
while charming giants to tank for him solo.  I just /nod and continue to do<br/>
my thing.<br/>
<br/>
To optimize, I try to be consistent.  The following refers to hotkey<br/>
slots...the order in the gem bar doesn&#39;t matter.  Hymn is always in slot #4.<br/>
Charm is always in slot #5.  Pixie in slot #6.  Manasong in slot #7.  Selos<br/>
in slot #8.  My twist is always, #1, #2, #3, and they are whatever is<br/>
appropriate.  For most groups, they are #1-Anthem, #2-Psalm, #3-Fulfil&#39;s.<br/>
If I&#39;m twisting in hymn, then I&#39;ll just twist #1, #2, #4, or whatever<br/>
combination of 1-4.  :)  Basically, I try to minimize the stretch.  To round<br/>
it out, Pet Attack macro is #9, and Assist is #10.<br/>
<br/>
I just got 34, so I&#39;m not really familiar with my new song yet.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think I want to replace hymn with it, though, since it requires a string<br/>
instrument, but if it&#39;s during downtime, it&#39;s probably the best choice.  Not<br/>
sure, haven&#39;t played for a week, and was 34 for only a couple hours before<br/>
logging last time, so...heh.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t manasong during battle, at this point.  No battle should take long<br/>
enough to require it, so it doesn&#39;t get twisted.  I&#39;m adamant about it,<br/>
since I spend downtime twisting it and hymn.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay - to start another, on-topic, thread, I wanted to know a bit about <br/>
your success with &quot;twisting&quot; songs.<br/>
1) How many songs can you twist at once - assuming constant effect songs.<br/>
2) What do you do to optimize your twisting?<br/>
3) What is your current playlist?  What do you sing in battle, and what out <br/>
of it?<br/>
<br/>
Just a few questions from a young-again bard<br/>
