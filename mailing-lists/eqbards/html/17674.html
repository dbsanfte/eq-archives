<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567688717">ditto, our monk puller always equips this for the AC and resists.  he<br/>
doesn&#39;t do much fighting lying on the ground, and there are better shields<br/>
out there for those other classes listed.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; For my guild, this shield goes to monks before alot of other<br/>
&gt; classes.  Why?  Because they pull, and when you&#39;re the puller in poh,<br/>
&gt; there is no better shield to help with fear and increase your <br/>
&gt; AC more than<br/>
&gt; this one.  Monks being able to equip this shield is an ability we take<br/>
&gt; advantage up, so don&#39;t discount it :P. </span></blockquote></div>
