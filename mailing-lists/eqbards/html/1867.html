<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825054526">Heyo.  I&#39;ve been lurking on the list since its inception so I thought I might<br/>
introduce myself.  I&#39;m Luvas of Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought I might relate my story from last night.  I had probably the<br/>
best<br/>
night of playing EQ ever, getting a lot of experience and loot.  I had been<br/>
hitting<br/>
the bandit camps in W Karana off and on as a soloist and in random groups over<br/>
the<br/>
last few weeks (I have an erratic schedule and it&#39;s rare I can schedule times<br/>
to be<br/>
on with a fixed group).  Although many of my friends had complained that the<br/>
new<br/>
patch had &quot;ruined&quot; WK and made it a death trap, I found that all that was<br/>
really<br/>
required was a change in strategey (this is almost always true of EQ, I&#39;ve<br/>
found).<br/>
In one of my emails to my friends I was bitching about how the players I&#39;ve<br/>
been<br/>
grouped with &quot;don&#39;t know how to play with a Bard&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A little after logging on, I get a tell from a friend asking if he wanted to<br/>
join<br/>
up.  Sure, as soon as I outrun these three Bandits.  We meet up and the first<br/>
thing<br/>
he says is<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;So how do you play with a Bard?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I proceeded to show them.  Over the course of the evening, other friends and<br/>
aquaintances of mine came and went and the party size varied from two to six,<br/>
but in all the instances there was plenty to hunt and we had few problems.  We<br/>
were not a well balanced group by any means---all hybrids or Warriors, but<br/>
nonetheless we had a very profitable and enjoyable time.<br/>
<br/>
It was nice not to have the Warriors charge in just as you&#39;re equipping your<br/>
Lute to Lament a few of the six Bandits.  It was nice not to have to wait for<br/>
the Ranger to meditate after dumping his mana on heals that I could have<br/>
easily<br/>
done with Hymn of Restoration in half the time.  It was nice to have my buff<br/>
songs<br/>
up and running before they wake the casters up with an arrow...<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the evening, everyone (myself included) knew just how powerful a<br/>
Bard can be in a group when used well.  It was great to be more than just the<br/>
tank that sings Anthem.<br/>
