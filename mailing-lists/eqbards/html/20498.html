<br/>
 I charmed an IG Magi sometime back, I don&#39;t recall my level, think it was<br/>
50 and couldn&#39;t have been over 51 since I&#39;m still there, hehe. It was nifty<br/>
to have him beat on Vox a bit in between trying to pound me into the ground.<br/>
I was in melee range most of the time of him and Vox, due to the press of<br/>
players and corpses. Vox got pulled into the hallway by accident and the IG<br/>
showed up halfway thru the battle. I recharmed him repeatedly, didn&#39;t have<br/>
anything special in the way of charisma either, and didn&#39;t get many resists.<br/>
Probably was just the way my luck was that night though. I managed to live<br/>
thru the whole fight even though the group tanks were among the first to go<br/>
down. It was a messy run, partly due to being a second or maybe third<br/>
attempt with staggered IG respawns and whatnot. We triumphed in the end, and<br/>
nothing good at all dropped.<br/>

/em hobbles back over to her rocker.  ;)<br/>
