&gt; Something that still amazes me is that you yanks have a choice, i have<br/>
seen<br/>
&gt; many threads on usenet saying.. &quot;are you going to vote?&quot; over here, come<br/>
&gt; election time, if you dont vote its a $100 fine or a stay at one of Her<br/>
&gt; Majesty&#39;s lovely hotels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That said... we still tick a box with an X, i mean what the hell is a chad<br/>
&gt; anyway? :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I mean if us American&#39;s can&#39;t figure out which darn holes to punch in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;ballot card (even a person with a doctorate was quoted as saying that<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;was confusing) then how can we expect Verant to always get things<br/>
right.<br/>
&gt; ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mmh no comments, apart from that the ballot card looked pretty confusing<br/>
&gt; to me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; luckely Im Danish we still cast our votes with a ball pen and an X.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hmm, they are based in San Diego. Surfing programmers? Guards should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;responding to our hails with, &quot;What&#39;s up dude? The waves are looking<br/>
fine<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;my man!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Whats wrong with surfers!!!! well Windsurfers anyway!?!?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m just glad that it was detected and fixed before it went live. I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; give<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;them more credit had they found and detected the bug themselves, but<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;again, we never hear about those.<br/>
