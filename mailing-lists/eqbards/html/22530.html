<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706962048">Hrm, you guys got him Wed night - grats Jysa on the greaves.<br/>
<br/>
Silent Justice got him Thursday afternoon-ish right before the server went<br/>
down.  Heard that 2 staves dropped.<br/>
<br/>
The Pantheon (us ;) got him Thursday night right after the servers came back<br/>
up. Druid drawers & Pally pants - Grats Tiana & Atreides.<br/>
<br/>
Inny is now pretty crowded again at the mid 50 level - damn waiting lists<br/>
for the big names and races to rare spawns.  Ok, well not exactly waiting<br/>
lists but lots of folks able to do the &lt; VP &#39;biggies.&#39;  And the damn<br/>
scheduling for the planes and the quest loot there is making for some<br/>
strange alliance - uber-guilds who never helped others are now begging for<br/>
slots in  small guild&#39;s plane runs just for the chance to get quest loots.<br/>
Strange days indeed.<br/>

We managed to kill VS last night (for the first time as a guild), despite<br/>
the bouncing HP problem.<br/>
Although it really ticked off the Clerics.  He dropped Bard pants!  (I<br/>
didn&#39;t get them, but I moved up to<br/>
first in line.)<br/>
