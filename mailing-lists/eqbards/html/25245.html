 </span></blockquote>Must be only because the following expansion will be dedicated solely to <br/>
bards. New bardic race of aviaks since they are natural musicians. Bards <br/>
will be the only class that can get to level 70. A whole new set of spells <br/>
for each level (oooh 70 new spells).<br/>

*sigh* I can dream, can&#39;t I? :-)<br/>

I&#39;d like to think that the reason no new songs have been posted yet is due <br/>
to extensive testing regimen they have setup for bard songs. All humor <br/>
aside, more than likely, they just forgot to include our songs in their <br/>
patch to the test server. They have a lot more time to add them in.  I <br/>
definitely would be curious as to what they would add to our song list.<br/>
