&gt; &gt; &gt; Try Elemental and Purifying. They used to stack and were very handy in<br/>

&gt; &gt; Are you sure?  I&#39;ve never been able to get Elemental and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Purifying Ehythms to stack, and I first tried it way back in<br/>
&gt; &gt; April, right after I got Purifying Rhythms.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well this was pointed out to me by another bard and he swears he was<br/>
&gt; using them all the time in Mistmoore up until this week&#39;s patch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He is just misremembering.  The reason I was so excited about<br/>
getting Guardian Rhythms (L17) is because it *does* stack with<br/>
Elemental Rhythms.  I do think a long long time ago, back in<br/>
March or early April, Elemental and Purifying did stack.<br/>
There was some discussion about this being changed on the<br/>
boards back then.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t tried stacking Purifying with Guardian, though last I<br/>
checked Purifying was bugged and used stringed instruments<br/>
instead of percussion like its scroll description says.  (That<br/>
is to say, to maximize magic resist, Elemental + Guardian<br/>
with a drum is better than Purifying + Guardian even if they<br/>
do stack.)<br/>
