 </span></blockquote>Well, though this is certainly a valid kabong target, I hope to sneak this<br/>
in under the Kabong radar. Easily the best, most intricate, most cohesive<br/>
quest I saw in UO was the Mordain Sisters quest on Great Lakes. Tons of<br/>
plot, a bit of monster fighting all done by about 5-6 women (okay and one to<br/>
two men PLAYING women too *laughs*). And the issues it focused on (sisters<br/>
with the smae mother but different fathers cursed to die if they did not<br/>
find love, Drow ex-hubbies coming back to cause trouble) was one that was<br/>
clearly and wonderfully female. Everyone had a blast, and the effect of the<br/>
quest in both time and bredth was WAY beyond the organized events, like<br/>
nothing I have seen before or since.<br/>
