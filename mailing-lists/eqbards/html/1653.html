<div id="ygrps-yiv-874223570">Very rarely do I disagree with more points in a single post than this one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But we are not<br/>
&gt;designed for soloing like the Ranger or Paladin are.  Frankly, anyone who<br/>
&gt;complains about not being able to solo well as a Bard is missing the point<br/>
&gt;to being a Bard.  You want to be alone?  Play a Ranger. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m level 23, and I soloed to 23 with no problem. Why? Because Bards are<br/>
simply an awesome solo class. We heal fast so we can engage in battle much<br/>
more rapidly without relying on a healer or the ability to &quot;sit this battle<br/>
out&quot; for healing. We run fast so we can escape the battles we are going to<br/>
lose, eithout relying on a party to save us. The Level 8 song allows us to<br/>
take single handedly a camp which would require a large group. We have a<br/>
decent fighting ability, and plenty of HP. I&#39;m sure soloing gets harder and<br/>
harder after level 23, but the game is supposed to get harder as one goes<br/>
along anyhow, I&#39;m up for the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, frankly,<br/>
&gt;if you&#39;re grouping, you should be gaining experience faster.  True, each<br/>
&gt;kill gives you less, but the overall result of being able to kill<br/>
&gt;repeatedly in shorter periods of time, or handle multiple creatures at a<br/>
&gt;time balances that out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I gain so little exp in a group it isn&#39;t even funny. This is why I don&#39;t<br/>
group, because the exp is AWFUL. Anyone else had the same experience? If<br/>
you haven&#39;t tried soloing, I suggest you try it. You may never want to go<br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And my final point of the night: (And here&#39;s where I expect to work on my<br/>
&gt;dodge skill:) I think Bards should be denied Plate Mail.  Already I can<br/>
&gt;hear the Battle Bards winding up - but hear me out:  The Bard was never<br/>
&gt;intended to be a grunt-class.  The big burly types should be the ones<br/>
&gt;soaking the damage and such, not us.  Of course, before they make any<br/>
&gt;changes like this, they should also fix that tiny little bug that makes us<br/>
&gt;the primary target ALL the time :(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I do group, I find one of my main selling points is &quot;I can&#39;t dish out<br/>
the damage, but I sure can take it&quot;. It seems to me that platemail is a<br/>
perfect way to counter-balance the relatively small amount of damage we can<br/>
do. Very few classes do less raw damage, but I can solo because even the<br/>
toughest creatures find it difficult to dent my bronze platemail. And in a<br/>
group, the combination of my platemail and ability to attract the attention<br/>
of the mobs, makes me a great tank, taking the damage whilst the<br/>
spellcasters dish it out. From a roleplay perspective (oddly necessary for<br/>
some of you)  . . . don&#39;t get an image of the Bard as some sort of<br/>
wandering weakling artist. Our skill may lie in singing, not fighting, but<br/>
we are strong surviving types. We are used to braving the dangers of the<br/>
wild, and can take a beating, as well we should.<br/>
