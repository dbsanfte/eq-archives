&gt; Isn&#39;t the effect of the Lament only temporary?  For example, lets say there<br/>

&gt; handle them all at once.  I target the first three in order and sing the<br/>
&gt; Lament.  In my experience so far, by the time I finish singing the Lament on<br/>
&gt; the 3d orc, its effects have already worn off on the first one I targeted.<br/>
&gt; If I move in at that point, two will attack me (#1 and #4).  Isn&#39;t this<br/>
&gt; tactic really only useful with the Bellow (which I don&#39;t have yet)?   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t had a problem with duration.  I&#39;ll have to time it<br/>
to be certain, but last night I lamented one dervish (not sure<br/>
if I had my mandolin equipped), we attacked and killed the<br/>
other, and the first dervish was still lamented.  If you /con<br/>
the target you just lamented, you&#39;ll notice it changes from<br/>
threatening or ready to attack, to apprehensive.  This is a<br/>
good way to check if those four laments you just did are still<br/>
holding as you get ready to take out the fifth mob.<br/>
<br/>
Lament seems to work for a very long time for me, enough so<br/>
that duration has never been a problem and I have never<br/>
bothered experimenting with it with a mandolin.  Maybe<br/>
charisma has something to do with it since it is a charm-type<br/>
song.  I&#39;ll try timing it and report back.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a four target limit for lament.  I<br/>
know there is for area-effect songs, but the /con message<br/>
above tells me the song is changing an attribute in that<br/>
particular mob which lingers for x seconds after your song.<br/>
That is, it works differently from area-effect songs in that<br/>
the effect is not linked to the bard (i.e. no connection<br/>
between mobs that have been lamented).<br/>
