<b>Subject:</b> Change in Resistance? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195447284">Am I imagining things or has anyone else been getting<br/>
an ungodly amount of resists.  Things that 2 days ago<br/>
I could charm, fear, or chain with now problem were<br/>
now getting 3 or 4 resists in a row.  Things like<br/>
lizard men in cazic and aviaks out at KFC (Karana<br/>
Fried Chicken).  All things that conned blue to me,<br/>
but were seemingly unimpressed with my vocal a talent.<br/>
 Am I out of my mind?  I didn&#39;t have any charisma<br/>
items one (except for my veil) so my charisma was only<br/>
95.  Could that be it?<br/>
<br/>
On a more humourous note, I was passing through the<br/>
Rathe Mountains and saw that big skele so I chamed<br/>
him, he was standing by an orc shaman so I told him to<br/>
attack it.  The fought, the charm wore off, and before<br/>
the skele came at me, the shaman cast SOW on it. <br/>
Couldn&#39;t believe it.  So I recharmed the skele who<br/>
then made short work of the shaman.  Me and my pet ran<br/>
down the road where couple of trolls where camping<br/>
lizard men.  As soon as they heard the big feet o<br/>
stompin, they scattered.  Had to send them a tell to<br/>
let them know he was my pet.  My biggest complaint<br/>
about the charm song is that it&#39;s so freakin fun that<br/>
I spend 50% more time goofing off.  Oh well.  One more<br/>
question, do you not get exp for a creature your pet<br/>
kills? Twice I had a rook kill another rook and got no<br/>
exp for it.  <br/>
