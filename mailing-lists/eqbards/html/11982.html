<div id="ygrps-yiv-631399763">Has anyone figured out any further information regarding Walthin<br/>
Fireweaver&#39;s &quot;bardic weapon&quot;? I&#39;m very intrigued by this, but have yet<br/>
to find a speech trigger that he will reply to with information on such<br/>
a weapon.<br/>
<br/>
An individual on our server started a hoax a couple weeks back stating<br/>
they had made a very powerful bard weapon...how unfortunate some people<br/>
suffer from mental illness and think this is humerous. I do however<br/>
believe that it&#39;s very probable Walthin&#39;s weapon can be quested for in<br/>
the game. My faction with the temple is &quot;warmly&quot;, so I can confidently<br/>
say it&#39;s not an issue of faction. Any rumors, facts, or ideas would be<br/>
welcome.<br/>
