<br/>
I used to be confused by these occurrences, but I think I finally figured<br/>
out at least part of what is going on.  I&#39;m not sure what starts the whole<br/>
agro circus, maybe some bug of leftover bard code from when our songs<br/>
affected everyone in the radius and not just those grouped with.  Whatever<br/>
starts it I do understand now how it gets passed and why it doesn&#39;t go away<br/>
when you zone.<br/>
<br/>
What happens is somehow a wolf, in this example, gets you on its hate list.<br/>
When it happens you are out of &#39;chase&#39; range so the wolf goes on its merry<br/>
way passing its hate for you on to other wolves it meets in its travels.<br/>
Pretty soon every wolf in the zone hates you.  As soon as you come within<br/>
&#39;chase&#39; range of a wolf that hates you, he beelines for you.  Since &#39;chase&#39;<br/>
range is so much larger than agro range in Kunark and Velious, it is readily<br/>
apparent how weird the event is when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
When you are grouped, your groupmates are also on the hate list of all these<br/>
wolves.  You camp, the list is cleared... for you.  You come back and group<br/>
with the former groupmate, still ok.  You pulse one song on that groupmate<br/>
though and suddenly you get added to the hate list of every single mob that<br/>
has the groupmate on their hatelist in the entire zone.  How wolves halfway<br/>
across the island know you cast a beneficial spell on an enemy is a mystery,<br/>
but that&#39;s VI logic for you.<br/>
