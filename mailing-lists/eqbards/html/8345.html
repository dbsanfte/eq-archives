<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679763013">This is slightly off topic, but....<br/>
<br/>
I used to talk with Goatnatos quite a bit.  In fact, we fought a couple of<br/>
times together way back in the &quot;olden days&quot; in Misty Thicket.  However, I<br/>
strongly believe that Goatnatos has quite playing EQ all together, or that<br/>
he&#39;s moved onto another character class.  I haven&#39;t seen him in Norrath in<br/>
over 3 months now.<br/>
<br/>
Even more off topic...<br/>
<br/>
I am going to make a proposal to the &quot;Concert Hall&quot; and &quot;Songs of Norrath&quot;<br/>
to make the definitive Song Analysis.  Basically, I&#39;m going to try and<br/>
convince everyone to send me their analysis of the songs and then I&#39;ll try<br/>
to mush them all together.  Might need someone to help me put it into HTML<br/>
format.  I was also considering trying to slap together a definitive Bard<br/>
Guide as well.... I see so many great tips, tricks, twists, strategies, etc,<br/>
etc - It would be nice to get them all together.<br/>
