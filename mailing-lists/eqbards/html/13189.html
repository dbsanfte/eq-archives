<div id="ygrps-yiv-161312074">I think bards getting bind would be good, however, I would prefer it if we<br/>
had our melee skills raised so that we could be more effective in combat,<br/>
we should have one more defence skill, Parry for example. And an attack<br/>
skill like kick, I have legs, why can&#39;t I kick?? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m asking<br/>
for Double attack here, kick is an overlooked combat skill by alot of<br/>
warriors, and if bards did get kick I&#39;m not sure if they would all use it,<br/>
this would involve another hotkey to mash away at. But to be honest at<br/>
level 32 I don&#39;t usually mash the keys now I have mana song so it would be<br/>
nice to have this skill addition.<br/>
<br/>
I say remove the daft instill doubt skill (what is the point?? We already<br/>
have fear). And give us these skills<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;As much as I would love a bind song, it would go against how every song<br/>
&gt;works. Our songs are not permanent effects.  They are not even long<br/>
&gt;lasting.  In general, the effects we create only last for a few seconds<br/>
&gt;after we stop singing or playing our song.  Binding is very different: it<br/>
&gt;is a permanent change to the environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The one exception to this is the charismatic catillion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I agree that all of our songs are temporary.  But I would point out that<br/>
&gt;all spells in the game are temporary, with the exception of Bind.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;summoned items are no-rent, and all others are buffs, DD&#39;s, DoT&#39;s, Heals,<br/>
&gt;etc.  There are no environment altering spells in the game that I know of<br/>
&gt;except Bind.  Perhaps a case could be made for Mem Blur, but that&#39;s one<br/>
&gt;spell out of 700.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excellent example... and one which holds equally true for bards.  When you<br/>
play Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, you *permanently* erase the damage<br/>
register<br/>
of the charmed monster.  This song removes, for the remainer of the<br/>
monster&#39;s lifespan, all recollection of who did damage to it.<br/>
<br/>
The delineation of melee skills is compelling in my eyes as one reason<br/>
bards<br/>
are not hybrids.  As John said, we&#39;re &quot;not-a&quot;, or put another way we share<br/>
characteristics of many classes without being classified as a member of<br/>
that<br/>
class.  We&#39;re kinda like rogues (silly skills), kinda like enchanters (some<br/>
buffs, debuffs, and crowd control), kinda like shamans (some more buffs,<br/>
minor healing).  Yet we&#39;re not-a-fighter, not-a-healer, not-a-caster.  We<br/>
got plate mail for no other reason I can see than because we get hit so<br/>
often - like clerics we were judged to be too fragile to drape in leather<br/>
granted our huge taunt power and low hit points.<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant calls us hybrids only because they&#39;re trying to simplify the<br/>
description of classes.  I think a more honest and accurate division would<br/>
be as follows: there are 3 fighter classes (warrior, monk, rogue); 3 healer<br/>
classes (cleric, shaman, druid); 4 caster classes (wizard, magician,<br/>
enchanter, necromancer), 3 hybrid classes (ranger, paladin, shadowknight);<br/>
and 1 bard class (bard).  Our songs are NOT like the spells of any other<br/>
class in the way they are implemented (pulses?  what&#39;s a pulse?  why would<br/>
I<br/>
weave spells?); we have unique nondisposable spell foci (instruments) which<br/>
are required for some spells (e.g. Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding) and augment<br/>
others; and almost every one of our spells improves linearly with the level<br/>
of the caster.  Plus of course there&#39;s the fact that we only get one spell<br/>
per level (well, in theory anyways).  Ok, ok, they&#39;re songs, not spells -<br/>
we<br/>
differentiate our effects from all other casters&#39;, don&#39;t we?  = )<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether bards are or are not hybrids, I think Verant&#39;s<br/>
publicly expressed logic for why some classes get bind is easy to apply to<br/>
bards.  They claim that &quot;casters&quot; get bind because they die more often.  I<br/>
contend that bards die as often as any single casting class.  Regardless of<br/>
arguments about travel time (e.g. bards don&#39;t need binding because they run<br/>
so fast - which would also eliminate druids from needing bind, as they can<br/>
SoW, SoC, and port about), the reason why some classes have bind is claimed<br/>
to be due solely to the frequency of deaths of said class.<br/>
<br/>
Some food for thought, anyways...<br/>
