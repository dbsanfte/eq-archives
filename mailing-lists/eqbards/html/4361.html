<div id="ygrps-yiv-60324754">Have you ever tried hand to hand combat?  Go into a newbie zone and pick a<br/>
fight with an orc pawn or a gnoll pup.  They cant hurt you because of your<br/>
ac and your hp rebuilds faster than they can damage you.  But you will be<br/>
punching them for 1 point of damage.  Now you should be getting into groups<br/>
where they are attacking monsters that are so much higher than you that your<br/>
normal weps are having trouble damaging them.  Your role in that case will<br/>
be equiping an instrument and playing songs. So magic gloves and hand to<br/>
hand combat with monsters that you can barley hit with a Dirk or Combine are<br/>
not gonna do any good.  Even lower level monsters that your regular weps can<br/>
hit will be hitting you and your party pretty hard.  If you are in the<br/>
melee, you will be at risk of getting stunned and not having your songs be<br/>
used all of the time.  And you will get beat up for no gain.  My 2cp &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You would be better off standing off outside of melee and supporting your<br/>
party 100% of the time (no stuns to interupt you).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
p.s. I could be wrong - I have only had 2 or 3 partys and monster combos<br/>
where I was able to do this stand off support role.  but I have done the h2h<br/>
combat thing and it was pitiful!<br/>

		     The other day someone offered me Black iron gloves.  He<br/>
claimed that <br/>
		     they gave you the ability to punch magical only<br/>
creatures.  Low AC, no <br/>
		     stat adjustment, 5lb weight and high price dissuaded me<br/>
from buying <br/>
		     them.   I&#39;ve been thinking (ouch) though,  maybe they<br/>
would be handy <br/>
		     for those times that you play support bard and<br/>
contribute some kung fu <br/>
		     to the fight.  What do you all think?<br/>

		I&#39;ve been searching (on Veeshan) for one of these for 3<br/>
weeks now in various <br/>
		zones and continents. The *only* time someone was selling<br/>
one and replied to <br/>
		me was for 75pp. I&#39;m sorry, but magical or not - I&#39;m not<br/>
paying 75pp for a <br/>
		friggin&#39; dagger - at least not that particular dagger.<br/>
