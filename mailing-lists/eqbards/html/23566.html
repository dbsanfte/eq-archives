<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-801216967">Gonna tell a long story so bear with me :)<br/>
 <br/>
Well, it finally happened.  Tani started out untwinked, worked hard through<br/>
level 20ish.  But then I started to find little extra pieces of armor and<br/>
twink her out a bit.  So from level 20 to 40, shes been in lake of ill omen,<br/>
frontier mountains, overthere and now iceclad.  I love soloing and duoing<br/>
her.. its great fun.  But I&#39;ve never had much of this &quot;bard aggro&quot; problem I<br/>
always hear about... until last night.<br/>
 <br/>
Not sure what happened, all I know is that dire wolves usually have a fairly<br/>
small aggro radius, they will attack but you practically have to pull their<br/>
tails.  Well, after fighting a while, I run to a wolf and start fighting..<br/>
suddenly, I notice another wolf running right at me from a ways off.  I move<br/>
a little out of his path and notice that he veers right towards me.  &quot;Hrm&quot; I<br/>
think, this is odd.  <br/>
 <br/>
Suddenly I realize my health bar is dropping rappidly, and I f9 and see<br/>
there are 3 or 4 wolves on me.. &quot;Hrm&quot; I think again, and fire up selos...<br/>
start running a little, thinking i will kite them a bit.  <br/>
 <br/>
I start running and NO JOKE, all these wolves just start joining in, running<br/>
from out of sight to find me.. I f9 again and notice literally a PACK of<br/>
dire wolves after me - can easily count 8 or 9... &quot;Hrm&quot;....  Now a sane<br/>
person would zone, but I am anything but sane.  My friend had another<br/>
friend&#39;s druid logged at the gate, so I say &quot;Log Erico in and help<br/>
me!!!!&quot;... he does so and we procede to kite, melee, dot and otherwise kill<br/>
them over the next 15 - 20 minutes.  I may have miscounted but i think there<br/>
were at least 12 with more adding in now and then.<br/>
 <br/>
Thinking &quot;Ok they&#39;re all dead&quot; I start out again.  I take two steps.. and a<br/>
dire wolf charges me... start fighting him, and notice 2 more charging me<br/>
out of nowhere....this continues for 10 minutes.  <br/>
 <br/>
I finally zone, come back, all is happy... then group with erico for wolf<br/>
form and .... all that aggro is back on me again!!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, most of you probably have this happen regularly but it was a first<br/>
for me and it was INSANE.  My roomates were wondering why I was cackling and<br/>
laughing at midnight.<br/>
 <br/>
The good news is I got a full bubble of yellow in 40 in half an hour *grins*<br/>
