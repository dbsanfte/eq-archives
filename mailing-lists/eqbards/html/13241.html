<div id="ygrps-yiv-874233961">Lol I never said I was complaining but if I want to break into the lord room<br/>
I will and if I want to solo it I will. As for the boks and guks they are<br/>
childs play especilaly when you havbe the spawns seperated. Hell the lord<br/>
isn&#39;t that hard if you have just him verse myself a 50 necro. As for holding<br/>
the room with 2 people your dead wrong. A enchanter friend and I on my 50<br/>
necro held the room for 6hours with no problems and pulling from the<br/>
hallway. The room is not hard and any good player will know how to seperate<br/>
the spawns at least a goo 10 mimnutes apart. Also the keyword is necromancer<br/>
standing up to ythat with his pet and a bit of strategy. Mes works wonders<br/>
when breaking into rooms.<br/>

&gt;I hear this a lot.  &quot;Man, did you see that 49/50 Necro soloing the Lord<br/>
&gt;room?&quot;  I&#39;ve never seen it done, and no one that I know personally on<br/>

&gt;If you get a Guk Wizard spawning as the Lord placeholder you&#39;re in serious<br/>

&gt;would like to hear it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now granted, I have been in groups with a 50 necro where the pet solod Lava<br/>
&gt;Duct Crawlers in Sol B and the pet had more than half health at the end of<br/>
&gt;the fight.  Not only that, the necro (Cinder) said &quot;Sigh - you shoulda seen<br/>
&gt;my pet *before* they nerfed Necros.&quot;  Well damn.  A single LDC can make a<br/>
&gt;full group in their lower 40s run for the zone with a couple of deaths but<br/>
&gt;one Necro pet (blue to me) can solo one?  And Necros complain?<br/>

&gt;&gt; Heh the lord room is so easy. It&#39;s not as hard as people can<br/>
&gt;&gt; think and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;&gt; seen it held with a couple diffrent combos of two people casters<br/>
&gt;&gt; and usually<br/>
&gt;&gt; one is with pet though. However even after the patch the room is<br/>
&gt;&gt; quite easy<br/>
&gt;&gt; to crack with 1 necro and 1 person of any other class. It just takes a<br/>
