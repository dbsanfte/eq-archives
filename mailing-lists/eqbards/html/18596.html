<div id="ygrps-yiv-24511445">This is great news Kitasi.  You&#39;ve come a long way from your depression in<br/>
Unrest!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
When you charm kill stuff, if you haven&#39;t already figured this out, one<br/>
great tactic is to charm mob A onto mob B and let them duke it out.  When<br/>
they&#39;re getting low on health pick which one&#39;s going to win and make sure<br/>
you have it charmed at the end (sometimes you guess wrong, them&#39;s the breaks<br/>
:).  Then, let charm break and have your winning pet chase you around while<br/>
you look for the next mob to use as a pet.  Find a fresh mob, charm it onto<br/>
your near-dead pet.  Old pet dies pretty quickly and gives you experience.<br/>
Let the new mob chase you around til you find something else to engage, etc.<br/>
I have fought streams of Hill Giants like this in Lake Rathe for around an<br/>
hour or so before I ran out of viable fresh victims.  Then simply Chain/Fear<br/>
that last pet down for his experience too.  It&#39;s great.  You can do this<br/>
without taking any damage at all if you&#39;re careful.  This was a bit dicier<br/>
in the &quot;old days&quot; before the &quot;has broken your charm spell&quot; messages.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, another tip you may already know.  When looting the loser, lead your pet<br/>
a hundred yards away while charmed, give it &quot;/pet guard here&quot; and then<br/>
Selo&#39;s over and pick up your loot.  Even if charm breaks while you&#39;re<br/>
looting you&#39;ll have a few seconds before he gets to you.<br/>
<br/>
My charming button bank looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
[Selo&#39;s    ]  [Charm         ]<br/>
[Pet Attack]  [Pet Guard Here]<br/>
[Fear      ]  [Chains        ]<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the 39th charm spell uses mana...  you can&#39;t really use this<br/>
tactic at my level.  Charm is now mostly reserved for handling a pull of say<br/>
3 or 4 when you have no enchanter in your group.  I can charm one, put it<br/>
onto an unengaged one and basically tie up two mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Now, next time you&#39;re passing through the Karanas and Solo Froon and Choon.<br/>
It&#39;s fun and EASY.  :)<br/>

[51 Minstrel] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well as hoped I reached my 26th song last Thursday evening and quickly<br/>
&gt; scribed it.  I was in a group at the time so didn&#39;t get to try out the<br/>
&gt; Fear/Chains tricks that evening.  However we got hit by a huge train by an<br/>
&gt; ogre running out of the goblin mines and everyone was sure we<br/>
&gt; were going to<br/>
&gt; die.  The Zone call was made, so I strummed up Screech and crossed my<br/>
&gt; fingers.  Every single goblin fled.  The party seeing this decided to try<br/>
&gt; and pick them off as they came back.  With our druid and ranger<br/>
&gt; snaring them<br/>
&gt; and me playing Denon&#39;s, Hymn, and Screech, we were able to kill off a 14<br/>
&gt; goblin train 2 at a time.  It was glorious!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Friday nite I got a chance to try it out soloing while I<br/>
&gt; waited for other<br/>
&gt; guild members to show up.  All the tricks I was given worked excellently!<br/>
&gt; Kudos to all those who gave pointers.  Using Chains and Screech was<br/>
&gt; ridiculously effective.  If I accidentally got extra mobs it<br/>
&gt; never mattered,<br/>
&gt; they just ran away every time I feared and along the same path as<br/>
&gt; the mob I<br/>
&gt; was Chaining, so it was like keeping a steady stream of victims &#39;on the<br/>
&gt; leash&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was emboldened by my success and decided to try a different theme on the<br/>
&gt; whole Screech tactic.  An all instrument Screech version.  Try this if you<br/>
&gt; dare!  I ran into the middle of the haunted tower in the Lake of Ill Omen,<br/>
&gt; you know the one with the Icebone, Charbone, and Warbone<br/>
&gt; skeletons.  I then<br/>
&gt; fired up Denon&#39;s with my horn nailing all five skeletons (All blue to me).<br/>
&gt; I then twisted in Fear and Hymn switching to Mandolin for Hymn.  From the<br/>
&gt; comments of the 5 or 6 passerby it must have been quite hilarious.  The<br/>
&gt; Screech would send the skeletons (mostly DoT&#39;d) running from the tower.  I<br/>
&gt; would heal with Hymn.  They would run back in, get a dose of Denon&#39;s, a<br/>
&gt; quick Screech, and then run back out.  After several minutes of this they<br/>
&gt; all lay dead around me and I never lost more than a bubble of health to<br/>
&gt; resisters or when pulsing Denon&#39;s.  I still can&#39;t believe I was<br/>
&gt; able to solo<br/>
&gt; 5 blues that in melee would each do 3-4 bubs to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Needless to say the tactics were a huge success, thanks all<br/>
&gt; again!  I&#39;m very<br/>
&gt; glad I was in an optimistic mood on Friday and downloaded the<br/>
&gt; Solon&#39;s tricks<br/>
&gt; from Rokenn&#39;s Song Analysis site.  I made 27th on Saturday nite and by<br/>
&gt; Sunday evening I had practiced on newbie mobs and was happily soloing duos<br/>
&gt; and trios of white/blues using Sirens.  I can&#39;t wait to get back to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I learned a couple of important things about Siren&#39;s in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
&gt; Do not try to charm the renegade Iksar.  I could not even charm Iksar<br/>
&gt; bandits (probably about 15 levels below me).  I got 10 resists in a row on<br/>
&gt; an Iksar bandit and gave up.  I had previously tried an Iksar brigand and<br/>
&gt; gotten 10 resists in a row on that mob as well.  Sabertooths seem quite<br/>
&gt; susceptible to charm.  A sabertooth grimalkin is quite capable of<br/>
&gt; killing 3<br/>
&gt; blues before you need a new pet and seldom resisted my Sirens<br/>
&gt; attempts even<br/>
&gt; with battle gear on (93 cha).  Warbones skels, although easier to<br/>
&gt; melee solo<br/>
&gt; than Iksar Exiles, can strangely beat those same Exiles when used<br/>
&gt; as a pet.<br/>
&gt; My blue Sabertooth Grimalkin pet was even able to beat a white/black Iksar<br/>
&gt; Exile and only lost about half its health.  Those Grimalkins hit hard!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for all the suggestions!<br/>
