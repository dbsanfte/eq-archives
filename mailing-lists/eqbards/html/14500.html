<div id="ygrps-yiv-572216692">If I remember correctly the Ogres, Giants, and Goblins were the creations of <br/>
Rallos Zek.  At one time they had conquered a large part of Norrath.  The <br/>
other gods got angry and banish RZ for his meddling, the giants were <br/>
scattered, the orges were cursed to thier present form as were the goblin <br/>
clans.<br/>

Excerpt from the history:<br/>
Several of the races became bent on expansion and warfare became part of <br/>
their developing cultures. And of all the races, it was the Ogres who <br/>
quickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, and their empire <br/>
grew outward from their mountain home until it eventually encompassed a <br/>
large portion of Tunaria(now known as Antonica), largest of the known <br/>
continents. Their knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, until they <br/>
became weary of only Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and <br/>
dimensions, invaded the Plane of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with pride <br/>
as his creations challenged the gods of that realm, and when they eventually <br/>
knew defeat, the Warlord himself led a second invasion. The war that ensued <br/>
shook the heavens and angered the greater gods. Through their combined <br/>
might, Rallos Zek was finally thwarted and forced back to his domain, after <br/>
which a great barrier to the Planes of Power was erected, denying entry to <br/>
both the lesser gods and mortals as well. And then, in what some view as <br/>
spite and others justice, the gods cursed the Warlord&#39;s creations. Thousands <br/>
of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed around them. The Giants were <br/>
spread from one end of the earth to the other, forced to flee their homes as <br/>
the gods brought snow and ice to their previously lush lands. And the <br/>
goblins were also cursed, but no writings remain of their punishment as they <br/>
no longer keep records of their history (which is perhaps some indication as <br/>
to the severity of their curse). Thus began the Age of Monuments.<br/>

&gt;I assumed the big dog was nagafen too, buy maybe it is the leader of the<br/>
&gt;kobolds - kind of like the way Egyptian art depicts their kings as<br/>
&gt;physically larger than the rest of the rabble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Technically Nagafen is a wyrm, a dragon is closer to a reptilian creature<br/>
&gt;than it is to a mammal like dogs or kobolds.  I would expect to see the<br/>
&gt;Iksar of Kunark worshiping a dragon but not kobolds.  Maybe goblins, what<br/>
&gt;the heck are they related to or derived from within the lore of Norrath?<br/>
&gt;Fire Giants?  Well they do belong to the ancient race of Norrathian<br/>
&gt;creatures according to the lore of the land right?  Dragons first then<br/>
&gt;Giants? Much later Elves and so forth...or am I getting confused with the<br/>
&gt;Silmarillion?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course I am being silly and thinking too hard about this.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think I can answer some of this, and am surprised you<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t spot it too<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with all the time you spend there.  The white critters are<br/>
&gt; &gt; frogloks I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe.  The one with the glowing eyes is perhaps the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first undead froglok?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Their eyes are a glowing yellow as I recall.  Did they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a war with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kobolds perhaps?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Why would the kobolds paint frogloks on their walls?  As far as I<br/>
&gt; &gt;   can tell, I don&#39;t think the kobolds know anything about frogloks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I think goblins, firegiants, kobolds, and nagafen are portrayed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   But who is who is hard to tell, besides the big dog Nagafen.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;   in fact it is Nagafen, it may not be.<br/>
