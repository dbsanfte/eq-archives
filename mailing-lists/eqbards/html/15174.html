&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My hubby has changed from playing a monk to playing a human shadowknight<br/>
&gt; &gt;(he secretly plans on revolting from his God - shhh).  Now that he can<br/>
&gt; &gt;make a pet, I need to worry about what songs are bad to play when his<br/>
&gt; &gt;pet is around.  Do songs like the Chords of Dissonance affect the pet?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Will the pet also run fast when I&#39;m playing Selo&#39;s?<br/>

&gt; Pets are treated as non-party members for our songs.  So if you are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>singing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; AE attack songs the pet will get hit, but not be effected by the song.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you will be added to the pets hate list, so if the pet&#39;s master goes LD<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pet will aggro on you.<br/>

unless I sang an AE song AFTER she went LD...<br/>
<br/>
The only other song to worry about is obvious....  Invis.  Not that I<br/>
haven&#39;t accidentally killed pets on numerous occasions. :)<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s will NOT affect the pet, nor will any other &quot;Party&quot; songs.  The pet<br/>
normally will catch up before too long, tho. :)<br/>
