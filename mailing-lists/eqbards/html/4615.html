&gt;Does anyone think that bards should not be limited to memorizing only<br/>
&gt;eight songs at a time?  I just made 20th level and for the first time<br/>
&gt;had to think really hard on what songs I wanted to memorize.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem with &gt;this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every caster class has this problem actually. Yes i think we could use at <br/>
least a couple more slots for songs. I don&#39;t think bards have it quite as <br/>
bad as Shamans though - they have a SLEW of AWESOME buff spells and if they <br/>
want to uber-buff party members they normally end up switching spells out <br/>
EVERY time they buff. That would terribly irritate me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I can safely say that I will almost always have Selos and Hymn of<br/>
&gt;Restoration memorized.  Anthem or Warsong is another automatic.  That<br/>
&gt;leaves me with 5 slots for all the remaining 18 songs I know.  If the<br/>
&gt;choice is hard now, I can&#39;t imagine what its like later on down the<br/>
&gt;road.<br/>

I have Selo&#39;s memmed when outdoors, but will swap it with Pixie Strike or <br/>
something while indoors. Hymn of Restoration is pretty much obsolete if you <br/>
are grouped with healers and have mana song. Now that I have Celerity and  <br/>
stack it with Chant of Battle I never touch Bellows.<br/>
