<br/>
Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Since the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, the EverQuest Live team<br/>
has been working on a number of things, from addressing issues in Velious to<br/>
adding additional content to other portions of the world. At this same time,<br/>
we&#39;ve been working towards a point where we can stop tweaking class-based<br/>
abilities, and declare with confidence that they are as &#39;balanced&#39; as we can<br/>
make them.<br/>
<br/>
It is a foregone conclusion that the diversity of EverQuest&#39;s population<br/>
will never let us reach a point where everyone will be perfectly satisfied<br/>
with their class&#39;s abilities, as nearly every change we make tends to bother<br/>
some people while pleasing others. Still, we are confident that we can reach<br/>
a point where problems in our current game systems can be reduced to the<br/>
point that those left are either negligible in their impact, or offset<br/>
inversely by a similar problem affecting gameplay in an opposite direction.<br/>
We&#39;re nearly there, but following heated debate and the review of material<br/>
and opinions sent in by the players, we&#39;ve decided to make some exciting and<br/>
unprecedented changes to a game system that has remained intact since<br/>
release: the experience system itself.<br/>
<br/>
While the EverQuest Message-board FAQ states that the experience system is<br/>
not subject to post-production changes, it also explains that as developers<br/>
of an ongoing MMORPG in a dynamic world, there are times that we need to be<br/>
flexible and address issues as necessary. Though it has always been our goal<br/>
to avoid changes to core systems whenever possible, our additional goal of<br/>
finalizing class balance takes precedence in this case.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to depart from our usual method of releasing information by<br/>
giving everyone some specific information in regards to how these systems<br/>
currently work, and how they will work after the patch. It is very important<br/>
to us that everyone understands our goals, and the fact that these changes<br/>
are helpful to all of the players. We can only do that by giving you the<br/>
details necessary for you to draw your own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
Zone Experience<br/>
<br/>
The first and perhaps easiest to explain change that we are making to the<br/>
experience system is the modification of what we call the &#39;Zone Experience<br/>
Multiplier&#39;, or &#39;ZEM&#39;. Currently, every creature in game of a given level<br/>
yields a fixed amount of &#39;Base Experience&#39; (experience before it is<br/>
allocated to group members). That base experience is then multiplied by the<br/>
ZEM which is set to a value in correlation with the risk in a particular<br/>
zone compared with the reward; at least, that is the goal.<br/>
<br/>
Recently we evaluated many underutilized dungeons and considered reasons why<br/>
they might be underutilized. Some people suggested that proximity of bind<br/>
locations plays a part, and as such we are considering adding more binding<br/>
locations to the game. We of course will not allow everyone to bind on the<br/>
doorstep of a dungeon, but these changes should hopefully reduce the<br/>
potential run for a melee class. While additional binding locations probably<br/>
will not be in the next patch, we did want to discuss our thoughts on the<br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion, one that probably has the most merit, is that some<br/>
dungeons are too risky given everything concerned. The natural conclusion is<br/>
that we should increase the reward in order to offset the added risk. Our<br/>
contention is that most people would rather be grouping and fighting their<br/>
way through a dungeon because it&#39;s more fun, but feel &#39;forced&#39; to sit<br/>
outdoors and camp zero-risk single spawns because it is safer and thus more<br/>
efficient. While that statement might be true in an ideal world, it usually<br/>
results in crowding in these popular outdoor zones (for example, Lake of Ill<br/>
Omen or Oasis). The crowding in these zones really results in less efficient<br/>
progress than one could make in a dungeon given a good group, but is still<br/>
SAFE, at least ensuring that one will not have to tolerate &#39;going<br/>
backwards&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
We can increase the reward of a particular dungeon in two fashions: We can<br/>
either put in good loot, or we can change the ZEM. The problem with<br/>
increasing the quality or quantity of loot is that if the loot is good<br/>
enough, it&#39;s more likely to draw people far above the desired level range<br/>
for the dungeon, making it some place that appropriately leveled folk choose<br/>
to avoid. The second problem with the ever-increasing quality of loot is<br/>
inflation: as good loot becomes more widely available, its value and the<br/>
prestige value from owning it declines.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, we decided that the most appropriate action for several<br/>
underutilized dungeons would be to increase the ZEM; that is, increase the<br/>
amount of experience that everyone gets when adventuring in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
As of the next patch, you will receive additional experience (per kill) in<br/>
the following zones:<br/>
<br/>
Droga increased by 12%<br/>
Nurga increased by 12%<br/>
Solusek&#39;s Eye (Sol A) increased by 13%<br/>
Najena increased by 13%<br/>
Befallen increased by 13%<br/>
Paw increased by 13%<br/>
Permafrost increased by 13%<br/>
Kaesora increased by 18%<br/>
Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20%<br/>
Runnyeye increased by 20%<br/>
Kerra Ridge increased by 20%<br/>
The Hole increased by 25%<br/>
Grouping Bonus<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always been the first to say that EverQuest is designed to promote<br/>
grouping. Those who prefer to solo should be able to do so with some<br/>
restrictions, but probably will not be able to go everywhere and do<br/>
everything like a well-oiled, or like multiple well-oiled groups. This is a<br/>
main foundation of EverQuest, and is what drove our decision to implement a<br/>
class-based system where classes have strengths and weaknesses that<br/>
complement each other.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from making it so that the best gear requires groups, either to get<br/>
quest items or get the best gear directly, our goal was to make it so that<br/>
groups could advance faster than a solo player. One way we tried to reach<br/>
this goal was by putting experience bonuses in dungeons, so our changes<br/>
mentioned above should certainly help in that area. Another way we tried to<br/>
reach that goal was by giving a per-kill experience bonus based on the size<br/>
of the group.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that has been confirmed by many of our high level players, both<br/>
inside and outside the company, is that the &#39;best&#39; groups can already<br/>
advance faster in a grouping situation than by any one member camping a<br/>
single spawn. However, it has been pointed out that not everyone has the<br/>
opportunity to get in the &#39;best group&#39;. This led to many players choosing to<br/>
&#39;camp the single spawn&#39; because they then do not have to worry about someone<br/>
else getting their character killed. This in turn exacerbated the problem,<br/>
as many players chose to &#39;camp the single spawn&#39; from creation to old age,<br/>
and are just beginning to experience grouping and learn group-skills at<br/>
about the time that dungeons become the most unforgiving. The inevitable<br/>
result is that the level 50 &#39;dungeon newbies&#39; contribute to the fact that<br/>
the group isn&#39;t the &#39;best group&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to get people grouping earlier, and provide them enough of a<br/>
bonus where they do not feel that they are losing ground during the learning<br/>
process. We feel we can do this by doubling the grouping experience bonus<br/>
and by scaling it up based on the size of the group. Currently, the bonus is<br/>
an additional 2% experience per group member, not counting the first one,<br/>
leading to a maximum bonus of 10%. Following the next patch, the bonus will<br/>
be as follows:<br/>
<br/>
2 person group - 2% total bonus.<br/>
3 person group - 6% total bonus.<br/>
4 person group - 10% total bonus.<br/>
5 person group - 14% total bonus.<br/>
6 person group - 20% total bonus.<br/>
This bonus is applied to the total experience reward for killing a creature<br/>
prior to distributing it to the group.<br/>
<br/>
Many people have pointed out that when killing in a group you get less<br/>
experience per kill. This is of course true, but what is often missed is<br/>
that you can kill many more creatures, and creatures of a higher level when<br/>
in that group. For instance, a good two-person group should be able to kill<br/>
things of a higher level over twice as fast as a solo person should. Now,<br/>
we&#39;re going to give them even more of a bonus for doing so, AND make it<br/>
easier for people to find pickup groups on the basis of getting higher<br/>
scaled bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we very well may decide to revamp and/or readjust NPC populations<br/>
and/or experience multipliers in the future in order to ensure that groups<br/>
adventuring there find them worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
Experience Penalties - Description<br/>
<br/>
I think that it would be appropriate to say that most players are aware that<br/>
there are different experience requirements for advancement based upon the<br/>
race and class you choose to play. Ogres, for instance, require more<br/>
experience to level than Halflings, and Shadowknights require more<br/>
experience to level than Warriors. As such, an Ogre Shadowknight requires<br/>
FAR more experience to level than a Halfling Warrior does. What some people<br/>
have discovered is that when in a group, everyone shares in this penalty.<br/>
Before getting into our plan, I think that its important to talk about what<br/>
our goals were regarding experience penalties and the group sharing in that<br/>
penalty.<br/>
<br/>
When EverQuest player characters were being designed, it was immediately<br/>
apparent that some races and classes would be more powerful than others<br/>
given versatility and other factors. Later, it came to light that the<br/>
concept of being &#39;more powerful&#39; began to break down at the upper levels,<br/>
given that everyone capped at the same level. We could not let any one race<br/>
or class be immensely more powerful than another at that final point, as it<br/>
would essentially put parts of the game off limits to those who chose the<br/>
less powerful classes. While we did a good job of making races vary in<br/>
power, but not so much as to be unbalancing, the same could not be said for<br/>
classes. Still, though classes would be roughly equivalent in regard to the<br/>
compelling reason to play them through versatility, the experience penalties<br/>
were kept.<br/>
<br/>
In regards to the sharing of the experience penalty, it was apparent in<br/>
beta, before the penalty was shared, that those playing characters without<br/>
an experience penalty leveled faster than those that did. It was obvious<br/>
that this would occur, but it was to the extreme that a group of friends,<br/>
all playing together, would become separated to the point that they could no<br/>
longer group efficiently in the mid to upper-mid levels. So we chose to<br/>
distribute experience in the group on the basis of the total experience of<br/>
each member rather than the level, in order to keep groups together.<br/>
<br/>
As such, a level 20 Troll SK, having more experience total than a Human<br/>
Wizard of the same level, would get more experience from each kill, while<br/>
the total experience for the kill was unchanged. Essentially, the SK would<br/>
take part of the Wizard&#39;s share were everything distributed equally to begin<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
Experience Penalties - Resolutions<br/>
<br/>
Over the past week the EverQuest team has been considering experience<br/>
penalties in all their forms. We had many meetings where the issue was hotly<br/>
debated from both sides. We had to consider not only the effect on the<br/>
individual player, but also the effect of any changes on the game as a<br/>
whole. Eventually, we nearly unanimously decided the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. Race-based penalties are appropriate. An ogre, for instance, does indeed<br/>
make a better warrior than a halfling. It is not so little that the faction<br/>
and size problems make up for it, and not so much that it is really<br/>
unbalancing at upper levels, but enough that the penalty should apply.<br/>
Secondly, the penalty is not so severe (compared with class-based penalties)<br/>
that it would cause groups to break up on the journey from one to sixty due<br/>
to level differences.<br/>
<br/>
2. Class-based penalties are not appropriate. Classes are roughly equivalent<br/>
in power throughout the level ranges, and the versatility does not make up<br/>
for that penalty. In fact, the majority of changes made to classes in the<br/>
name of balance in the last year were based on the assumption that, at the<br/>
high end, each class should still be roughly as needed and balanced as any<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
3. Penalties, in any form, should not be shared with the group. Players know<br/>
that no one class is immensely more powerful/valuable than another, and as<br/>
such it is not fair to ask them to share a burden. If classes with penalties<br/>
were really more powerful or valuable than the other classes, then it might<br/>
be right, but that isn&#39;t the case here. Furthermore, sharing of penalties<br/>
causes people to reject potential group members on the basis of them<br/>
&#39;sucking&#39; too much experience.<br/>
<br/>
4. We&#39;re going to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
5. Class-based experience bonuses (which warriors and rogues get) are also<br/>
not appropriate, as they cannot be so if penalties are not. However, we&#39;ve<br/>
decided to leave this as-is, since the bonus is not so severe as to be<br/>
unbalancing. Bottom line: we don&#39;t feel the bonus is enough to warrant a fix<br/>
that could be interpreted as a &#39;nerf&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Experience Penalties - Implementation<br/>
<br/>
Though people often refer to the class-based penalties as the &#39;Hybrid<br/>
Penalty&#39;, most classes have a penalty. Hybrids just have the largest. A<br/>
hybrid requires 40% more experience to level than standard, Monks require<br/>
20% more, and Intelligence casters require 10% additional experience.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we cannot change the experience tables themselves without<br/>
running each character (which number in the tens of millions) through an<br/>
&#39;Experience Converter&#39; without existing players changing levels<br/>
spontaneously. While some might argue that we should grant free levels to<br/>
everyone with a penalty, that would not be in the best interest of gameplay.<br/>
After all, who would want a paladin with level 40 skills (skills in the<br/>
player-sense, rather than the character-sense) in your level 60 group<br/>
tomorrow? Everyone earns his or her experience under the rules that exist at<br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
This means that we must address the penalty differently: basically, for<br/>
every kill, after all grouping bonuses and zone bonuses are applied, the<br/>
experience will be split up according to level, rather than experience. For<br/>
those classes that do not have a penalty, they will then be given that<br/>
share. Those classes that have a penalty will get their share, multiplied by<br/>
their experience penalty. Essentially we are creating extra experience to<br/>
give to those with a penalty after everyone else has gotten their share.<br/>
<br/>
Since penalties are always a value over &#39;1&#39;, this results in the creation of<br/>
additional experience. And, since shares are determined by level rather than<br/>
total experience as before, a character will get just as much experience for<br/>
a kill based upon the size and level of the group, regardless of the class<br/>
makeup. Finally, everyone in the group gains experience at a faster rate<br/>
because we&#39;re creating the additional experience for those with penalties<br/>
out of thin air, rather than taking it from other members of the group. That<br/>
means that after implementation, those without penalties will get more<br/>
experience for every kill than they would have if they ever grouped with a<br/>
class with a penalty.<br/>
<br/>
Now you&#39;ll notice that we are dividing up experience based upon the level<br/>
makeup of the group. For instance, if a level 20 and a level 21 group<br/>
together, the level 21 will get more experience per kill. That is however<br/>
only fair since the level 21 does actually contribute more value to the<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
There is a problem, however, with this &#39;new&#39; formula. Death penalties are<br/>
currently based off of the level before your current one. Secondly, everyone<br/>
suffers the same numeric experience loss on death as anyone else of their<br/>
race, regardless of class or class-based experience penalties. What this<br/>
means is: if I am a cleric, and you are an SK of the same level and race, we<br/>
both die and lose the same numeric value of experience (Example: 100,000<br/>
experience points). When we go back to recover from death, you as the SK<br/>
will get your 100,000 points back faster than I will as a cleric, since all<br/>
of the experience you get is multiplied by your class-penalty (1.4).<br/>
Essentially, I lose and gain experience at 1.0, but you lose at 1.0, and<br/>
gain at 1.4.<br/>
<br/>
This is a balance issue we decided was also necessary to address. If we are<br/>
going to make the statement that class experience penalties should not<br/>
exist, we then have to do it on both ends (with exception to the two classes<br/>
that we&#39;ve decided to leave as-is). As such, rather than losing the same<br/>
numeric value, loss on death will also be multiplied by the experience<br/>
penalty. Since everyone currently loses experience as if they are a warrior<br/>
of their own race, we do not want anyone to lose more relative experience<br/>
(e.g. experience such that recovery from death is more difficult). Hence, we<br/>
further multiply the experience loss on death by the class experience<br/>
modifier for warriors (0.9).<br/>
<br/>
In our example above, my cleric would lose 90,000 XP on death at my level<br/>
(Same as before since clerics do not have an XP penalty), but your SK will<br/>
lose 126,000 XP (Same as before, plus something to offset the experience<br/>
gain bonus). Death is, however, still easier to recover from for both<br/>
classes since we create experience out of thin air for every kill.<br/>
<br/>
We felt that it was important to announce this as well since those with<br/>
penalties will see a larger portion of their &#39;bubble&#39; lost upon a death, but<br/>
will now recover that experience much faster. It&#39;s VERY important to<br/>
understand this. Again, if you play a class that gets a bonus now when you<br/>
make a kill, you will also lose more due to death. Please remember this<br/>
when, after your first death post-patch, you see a greater experience loss<br/>
on your screen: you are also gaining more experience for each kill.<br/>
<br/>
Summary<br/>
<br/>
The changes that we are making in the next patch should have a profound<br/>
impact upon the game:<br/>
Classes no longer have a true class-based experience penalty, making it<br/>
easier for people to play the class that they want to play, rather than the<br/>
class that they feel compelled to play due to faster advancement.<br/>
Race based penalties are no longer shared with the group, and in truth are<br/>
not severe enough to greatly impact the advancement speed of any particular<br/>
race. Even the race with the worst penalty will level no slower than a human<br/>
monk does now, and in truth will level faster due to the other changes that<br/>
went in.<br/>
The grouping bonus increase, in addition to the other changes, makes<br/>
grouping much more efficient, without reducing the current efficiency of<br/>
soloing for those who prefer that route.<br/>
Experience modifiers turned up in the other zones should encourage people to<br/>
spread out, have more fun, and allow those staying behind in other areas to<br/>
have more fun themselves since the area is less crowded.<br/>
All players, assuming that they have an experience penalty, or ever group<br/>
with anyone who does, will level faster.<br/>
Many of these changes are quite involved in regards to their implementation,<br/>
and as such we want to be sure that everyone interested understands them.<br/>
Alan &#39;Absor&#39; VanCouvering will be happy to answer any questions that you may<br/>
have on the EverQuest Message boards. Until then, we sincerely hope that<br/>
these changes will help all players, whether &#39;uber&#39; or &#39;causal&#39;, experience<br/>
and enjoy EverQuest to their greatest potential.<br/>
