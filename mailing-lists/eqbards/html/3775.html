<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041975370">Some things do need fixing though like the rogue skills, druids at high<br/>
levels ( they can&#39;t go to any dungeons because of high fire resist ), and in<br/>
my opinion Necro research. The problem with necro research is that the words<br/>
are impossible to find. Currently on E&#39;ci two people on the whole server<br/>
have the level 34 Necro pet spell, the first research spell! Nobody levels<br/>
34-50 besides those two people have a pet spell better then the level 29<br/>
spell which is the last pet spell. Something is definitly wrong here. As for<br/>
wizards and Ice Comet at least they know where to look.<br/>

&gt;So many people complaining about downtime and exp loss and so on and so<br/>
&gt;forth.. have any of you read what Asheron&#39;s Call is doing?  They don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;to penalize people too harshly with exp so they decided that when you die,<br/>
&gt;you lose a few of your best items and a percentage of your money.  How&#39;s<br/>
&gt;that for not penalizing people to travel?  You all complain now at what<br/>
&gt;Everquest does.. be grateful that it&#39;s the best game of it&#39;s genre at the<br/>
&gt;moment.  Nothing even comes close to it and I doubt anything will for a<br/>
&gt;while.  Yes, it has its quirks.  And yes, it&#39;s taking a long time to fix<br/>
&gt;them all.  But would you have preferred waiting another year while beta<br/>
&gt;testers worked out all the bugs or enjoy playing the game now and live with<br/>
&gt;the bugs as they get fixed.  The more people are playing the more bugs are<br/>
&gt;found quicker and resolved quicker.  Now, there&#39;s just a matter of priority<br/>
&gt;as to what to fix first.  And quit trying to make every frigging class the<br/>
&gt;exact same as the other class.  You want to be able to bind?  Play a damn<br/>
&gt;spell caster.  You want to be able to run fast?  Play a damn bard or shaman<br/>
&gt;or something.  You want to dish out lots of DD?  Play a wizard.  Just quit<br/>
&gt;your whining and be grateful that you can&#39;t do exactly the same thing as<br/>
&gt;every other character in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m just so tired of hearing people wanting their characters to be god so<br/>
&gt;they can kill everything in site.. go play Doom and enter god mode if you<br/>
&gt;want to do that and see how much fun it is after a while.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my pipe blowing,<br/>
