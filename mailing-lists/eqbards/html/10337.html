<b>Subject:</b> Consolidation of new song ideas <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546237892">Yesterday I recommended that we come up with a list of song ideas to send to<br/>
Verant to give them some help for our missing songs below 50th level and for<br/>
the 51-75th level songs that will be part of the expansion.  A few of you<br/>
have come up with some pretty good ideas so far.  <br/>
<br/>
I will volunteer to consolidate all of the suggestions and prepare it for<br/>
submission to Verant.  However, I am going on vacation tomorrow through 5<br/>
December.  Because I will be gone so long, I am going to temporarily stop my<br/>
subscription to this list so I can avoid having my Inbox flooded with<br/>
messages.  So, unless someone else wants to volunteer to consolidate the<br/>
suggestions, I request that, in addition to posting your suggestion to this<br/>
list, you also send me a direct email.  My home email address is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bamadude@...">bamadude@...</a><br/>
<br/>
This may be a complete waste of time if Verant completely ignores us but I<br/>
think its worth a shot.  If you send in a song idea, I suggest using your<br/>
bards name as part of the song title.  If Verant uses your song idea, you<br/>
might get lucky and have your bard&#39;s name included as part of the game.  <br/>
