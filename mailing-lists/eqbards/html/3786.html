&gt; &gt; Some things do need fixing though like the rogue skills, druids at high<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels ( they can&#39;t go to any dungeons because of high fire resist ), <br/>
&gt;and in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my opinion Necro research. The problem with necro research is that the <br/>
&gt;words<br/>
&gt; &gt; are impossible to find. Currently on E&#39;ci two people on the whole server<br/>
&gt; &gt; have the level 34 Necro pet spell, the first research spell! Nobody <br/>
&gt;levels<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bear in mind that the druid and necro are probably the easiest<br/>
&gt;classes to play at the early and mid levels.  It makes sense<br/>
&gt;that they should become difficult at the end.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;particularly like it when games are designed like that, since<br/>
&gt;it means a choice you make based on your first few weeks of<br/>
&gt;play can have negative repurcussions several months later.<br/>
&gt;Ideally all classes should be roughly equivalent to each other<br/>
&gt;all the way through their advancement, but that&#39;s not the<br/>
&gt;paradigm EQ chose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And I thought we had a couple high level songs which lowered<br/>
&gt;monster resists?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this is were the grouping aspects of EQ take over.  Yes we have songs <br/>
that lower fire resist, also enchanters can lower resists as well (which is <br/>
why my bard loves grouping with enchanters, but that is another thread <br/>
&lt;grin&gt;).  This is not a solo&#39;ist game in the long run, esp if you want to go <br/>
into the dungeon depths.  The thing with Druids and Necros is that they are <br/>
so easy to solo up to high levels (30+) that the people who play them do not <br/>
get a chance to build grouped tactics.  So it is not so much that they are <br/>
difficult to play at higher levels, they are just suddenly forced to group <br/>
in the 30&#39;s and it can ge a bit harsh making the change that late in the <br/>
game.<br/>
