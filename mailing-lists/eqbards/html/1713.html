<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166687211">Early Platemail was cast from Iron, have a feeling your roomate&#39;s armor is<br/>
not quite the same as the armor I am eluding to, I&#39;m certain the knights<br/>
would be very impressed with your roomate, yet could probably pierce through<br/>
whatever she&#39;s wearing, because it sounds quite thin.  Early platemail was<br/>
so damned thick and heavy, if a knight were to be knocked from his warhorse<br/>
(horses bred specifically to be able to carry a knight) it meant likely<br/>
death, the knight trapped like a turtle on its back in the hot sun.  No one<br/>
forged stainless steel in those days.  (Come to think of it, maybe the EQ<br/>
plate is made of stainless steel.)  Little of this early armor remains, only<br/>
those pieces from especially short individuals, which no one else could fit<br/>
into, when said short individual died within it.<br/>

&gt;Roop - I&#39;ll concede your first point - we&#39;re egomaniacs, and the chicks dig<br/>
&gt;a man in metal.  But as for the rest:<br/>

&gt;This is a common fallacy of those who do not understand the incredible<br/>
&gt;construction techniques behind plate mail armour.  Plate mail had to be<br/>
&gt;well made, fit to the owner, and easily wearable.  Just as an FYI, my<br/>
&gt;roommate has been constructing her own suit of full plate, and after<br/>
&gt;several weeks of running around in it, she can indeed chase people down.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not easy (there certainly SHOULD be a stamina penalty) but it is<br/>
