<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920559253">Rokenn&#39;s song Analysis site has a link out to some detailed testing of the<br/>
various clarity stacking spells and songs. I&#39;m not sure if a lute test is in<br/>
there. I don&#39;t have the link handy here (at work). I have found that I don&#39;t<br/>
usually need to stack 2 clarity songs myself. C2 plus the 55 song seems to<br/>
do the job effectively and that frees up a song slot for me. The lute<br/>
definitely boosts health regen which in the long run saves mana.<br/>
