<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048751327">Hehe - maybe soon some of the &quot;secrets&quot; will be shared.  Lots and lots are<br/>
gonna be seeing dragons - cus they are &quot;old enough&quot; and their guilds are<br/>
&quot;big enough&quot; or they make alliances.  The first power guild on Innoruuk -<br/>
early Talquinn who are now Legions of Darkness (LoD - Elyana&#39;s guild) don&#39;t<br/>
share secrets.  My new guild The Pantheon has developed some methods of<br/>
their own and are now able to muster raiding parties in short order.  Our<br/>
New Year&#39;s Eve run was the 3rd nite we went in and successfully cleared<br/>
everything to the lair even though we were missing some key members of our<br/>
team and had guests along.   (Oh yeah - we have 3 of the 5 Skarlon swords<br/>
taken on our server ;p) <br/>
<br/>
The times they are a&#39;changin&#39;...  I am damn glad to be there and to get the<br/>
chance to see this stuff before it&#39;s &quot;/shout Level 50 Bard looking for a<br/>
dragon party - will play mana song in combat!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
FYI - I did not notice trouble with lag - both my songs played just fine.<br/>
Perhaps there is more trouble when you melee and try to weave two songs.  My<br/>
tanks were not feared one time nor was I.  Perhaps next time, when the<br/>
dragon is well under half health, I will melee some - but in the beginning I<br/>
prefer to defer any risk to my group. If they lose me to an angry dragon,<br/>
they lose a huge amount of MR.  My death hurts the whole group.  I worry<br/>
more about them all staying in song range so that they don&#39;t lose my buffs<br/>
so I move around to keep them in range.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, speaking of lag, one time I was weaving mana song and heal song: mana<br/>
pulse, heal pulse, mana pulse, heal pulse.  An enchanter in the group said<br/>
he was not getting the mana effect because he was lagged.  Has this happened<br/>
to anyone or is he just giving the standard caster line: &#39;play mana song and<br/>
nothing else?&#39;  Now I play mana, mana, mana, then heal til I get the icon,<br/>
then mana til my icon drops, then heal til I get icon then back to mana.  Is<br/>
it possible that a bard can weave songs faster than his party can get the<br/>
effects?  <br/>
<br/>
And finally, I think people are turning off the spam including the bard<br/>
spam.  And so I get &quot;Sylly, play mana song&quot; a lot.  And I smile sweetly and<br/>
say &quot;Already am!&quot; And then quick start the song in case I forgot to switch<br/>
after combat ;p  Maybe its just me but I am a lot less sensitive to these<br/>
&#39;friendly reminders&#39; now.  I sure wish that song had an icon - hehe.<br/>

		I really wish Elyana still subscribed to this list.<br/>
		She was doing both dragons, weekly, at lvl 42 - and<br/>
		they never failed. I&#39;m not disagreeing, or arguing,<br/>
		and I can&#39;t say anything (I&#39;m too young, myself), but<br/>
		I&#39;d like to hear what people that have done it did,<br/>
		and what they have to say about it. I only know<br/>
		(personally) 2 bards that have done dragons, and won.<br/>
