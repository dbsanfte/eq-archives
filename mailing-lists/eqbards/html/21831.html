If you have a copy of his post (or a url to it) I&#39;d appreciate reading what <br/>

&gt;no, that&#39;s not me.  of course kaearia posted on the concert hall that he <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have a lot of problems with the way verant is handling the issues either, <br/>
&gt;at least<br/>
&gt;with regard to gordon&#39;s monster post.<br/>
