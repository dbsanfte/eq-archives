<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026825845">I carry 20 throwing knives - carry over from before Bellow - for pulling<br/>
mobs out of a hopefully lulled crowd.  Plus I like the idea of throwing a<br/>
dagger &lt;eg&gt;  If I loot rustys, I&#39;ll throw them for fun.  And now pass me the<br/>
cheese, I am about to whine...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;waaa&gt; I wish bards could equip bows!  I think it looks so cool when someone<br/>
shoots a bow and arrow!  And looking cool is most important for bards!  Lets<br/>
petition them and get SoW made slower and bow and arrows for bards! &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

&lt;mmm nice camembert&gt;<br/>

		On a related note, have any of you bards used throwing skill<br/>
at all? I&#39;ve<br/>
		found it to be a collosal waste of money so far, but maybe I<br/>
am doing it<br/>
		wrong. :)</div>
