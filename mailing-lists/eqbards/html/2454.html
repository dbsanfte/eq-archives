<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*snip*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We&#39;ve all experienced the case where a party member<br/>
&gt;gets out of range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando and then falls behind the party.<br/>
&gt;Imagine the same thing happening 100 feet underwater.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is all complicated by the fact that it&#39;s very hard to see underwater,<br/>
&gt;and it&#39;s easy to get separated.  Also, people are swimmers of vastly<br/>
&gt;differing skills.  My swimming is maxed out from being in the OOT for so<br/>
&gt;long.  Other people my level often have swimming skills of 5-10.  Comparing<br/>
&gt;my swim speed to theirs is like comparing a jet ski to a flutterboard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not a problem with the /follow command. Everyone (including the <br/>
bard) targets and /follows the person with the lowest swimming skill and <br/>
everyone will stay within range of the song.<br/>
