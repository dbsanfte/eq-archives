<div id="ygrps-yiv-895121779">Greetings and Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
First off, you have a lot of great times ahead of you!  The bard is a very<br/>
capable and enjoyable class to play even though I do believe that it is also<br/>
one of the more difficult.  As a brad you get to experience things from the<br/>
caster class as well as the melee classes. You will get to do many things.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon you will need a weapon that can damage magical creatures.  So save<br/>
your money and try to do things to make money.  You will need about 50pp to<br/>
60pp to get either a Dragoon Dirk or a Combine Longsword.  By level 17, you<br/>
should have 2 magical weapons.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, keep your piercing skills maxxed with a giant snake fang<br/>
and your 1 hand slash maxxed with any good sword you can get in loot or<br/>
perhaps from friends and if you can get a decent 1 hand blunt staff or club<br/>
keep that skill maxxed as well.  Also work on swimming.  If you dont already<br/>
know them, learn all the zones and the best ways to get around (and I dont<br/>
mean /ooc Can anyone teleport me to GFay???&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I have over 110 days played on my bard and she is still lots and lots of<br/>
fun!  Bards are designed to be very valuable party members (and less so as a<br/>
powerful solo class.) So, the more fun you can have with people and partys,<br/>
the more you will enjoy your bard.  But it will take alot of time and an<br/>
enormous amount of dedication. And you will die, alot!  Hehe, so dont get<br/>
discouraged and dont pay too much attention to the problems of other people.<br/>
Enjoy your character and your class and all of the others in the game as<br/>
well.  While this game is not &quot;hard&quot; on the other hand it is not &quot;quick and<br/>
easy&quot; either.   the more fun you can make on your own, the more you will<br/>
enjoy things.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep us posted and ask any kinds of questions - we are always happy<br/>
to answer.  (Also, check the faq and the bard web site for really good<br/>
information. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a>  Enjoy!<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] New bard questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: Jennifer McComb &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mccomb@...">mccomb@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me introduce myself.  I&#39;m a new player to Everquest (received it for<br/>
&gt; Christmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>
&gt; shamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I subscribed to this mailing list a few days ago and so far have just<br/>
&gt; seen postings that talk about the higher levels.  I&#39;ve also noticed that<br/>
&gt; many of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What items should I<br/>
&gt; be pursuing in the near future?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard route?  What<br/>
&gt; makes the bard fun?<br/>
