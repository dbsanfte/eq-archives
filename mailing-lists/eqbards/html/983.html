you don&#39;t have to wait as long if you get that annoying &quot;you<br/>
are too close to use a melee weapon&quot; or &quot;that target is out of<br/>
range&quot; message but still &quot;uses&quot; the weapon in terms of the<br/>
delay (please everyone, /bug this :-).<br/>

Where do you find shurikens?  The monk guild has them, but<br/>
there are only two of them in all Norrath.  There is another<br/>
guild that carries them, but I&#39;ll leave it up to you to figure<br/>
out which one it is.  :-)<br/>

Another alternative to throwing weapons is to start your<br/>
bellow on the mob, and while the song is &quot;powering up&quot; switch<br/>
to your weapons.<br/>
