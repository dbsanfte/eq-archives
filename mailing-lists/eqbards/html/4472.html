&gt; environment, the level limit for pvp disappears, and if you do a /who you<br/>
&gt; will see that the person has &lt;LINKDEAD&gt; next to their name.  This tactic is<br/>
&gt; often used in Rallos Zek by unsavory types to kill PC they might not<br/>
&gt; normally be able to kill(the same types of people as our good friend<br/>
&gt; Silverios who, upon getting the disarm skill, proceeded to walk around in<br/>
&gt; every dungeon disarming everone she saw).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, a good friend lost a screaming mace to her, and, rather than go through<br/>
the hassle of trying to get a bracer of battle a do the quest , bought it back<br/>
from her later. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In Tallon Zek, the race war server, bards and enchanters will own when all<br/>
&gt; is said and done at lv 50, least until christmas&#39; expansion.  There are two<br/>
&gt; primary tactics that will prove deadly in pvp.  First, you can charm/make<br/>
&gt; them attack a high level mob, and then zone.  When you&#39;re wiped off of the<br/>
&gt; hatelist all that is left is your pet and the mob, and the mob will not stop<br/>
&gt; attacking the PC.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The problem with this tactic is that almost everyone knows about the sit/stand<br/>
trick now - when you&#39;re charmed or feared, click on sit/stand rapidly, and you<br/>
basically won&#39;t move, you&#39;ll just bounce up and down.  Another bug needing<br/>
fixing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Second, there&#39;s the fear, chains combo, in which the PC<br/>
&gt; is entirely helpless as they walk slowly around the zone while you whack<br/>
&gt; them from behind.  I was talking to a friend the other day that said the<br/>
&gt; anti magical aura song (lv 40+ i think) does some AMAZING things to PC spell<br/>
&gt; casters.  I&#39;m not too sure the legitimacy of this claim, but if it&#39;s true,<br/>
&gt; that will put us over the top as pvp gods.  And of course there&#39;s other<br/>
&gt; tactics, but none so devastating as the ones previously mentioned (unless<br/>
&gt; someone can think of any, and I would be thrilled to hear of any more).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In playing around with my friends, so far fear seems to be often resisted by<br/>
people the same level as me, so I&#39;m not sure how well this will work.  But<br/>
then, I&#39;ve only had the song for 2 bubbles or so, and I imagine it gets better.<br/>
