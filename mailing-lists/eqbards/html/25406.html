<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you are the only bard on a (guessing) 30+ person raid, how is it so<br/>
&gt;vital when there are 4+ groups with no bard and thus no bard resists?<br/>
&gt;Is your group the last one standing and victorius?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes - that&#39;s happened before (with AOE&#39;s).  But that&#39;s pretty moot anyway -<br/>
hopefully with proper aggro management - the group I&#39;m in (with main tank)<br/>
is the only one taking damage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes I am talking<br/>
&gt;end-game raids here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess you need to make it very clear that is your point; I was under the<br/>
impression you were including the 51-59 level range (or perhaps more<br/>
specifically 51-56 or so)<br/>
<br/>
If you are at the end-game and doing 30-60 person<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;raids and are level 60 or close to it, yes amassing that resist<br/>
&gt;equipment (and/or plat to buy it) is part of the deal.  Are you spending<br/>
&gt;all this time to camp seb or to go on raids?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about 75-80 percent of my time the past month has been 3-5 group raids.  But<br/>
again I&#39;m not talking about people at the end-game...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  All the time you refer to<br/>
&gt;involves getting those new items and plat and of course experience to go<br/>
&gt;on raids.  And I hope you have a jeweler friend in guild (I hope so with<br/>
&gt;110 people) or out that can help make the jewelery.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only one or two high enough to craft the high end unfortunately<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I just talked to a<br/>
&gt;jeweler friend I haven&#39;t seen in 4 months and he was more than happy and<br/>
&gt;willing to make me jewelery again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we all agree - that trying to &quot;balance&quot; a game across the needs of a<br/>
250K playerbase is difficult.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an inherent difficulty in balancing the needs of the hard-core<br/>
players at level 60 etc who play an ENORMOUS amount; vs the more &quot;casual&quot;<br/>
players like myself.<br/>
<br/>
You can argue that there is plenty of content already for the more casual<br/>
players - and the limited number of things at the &quot;end-game&quot; requires more<br/>
content; but again - the casual players seem to always (on Xegony at least)<br/>
be competing with the &quot;power&quot; gamers farming items in the zones we are<br/>
trying to get &quot;content&quot; out of...<br/>

<br/>
Amassing 2500p excess is no incognizant task time wise.  Then; finding a<br/>
Jeweler who can craft the gear, and getting all those items you refer to<br/>
take a significant amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
Getting to 60 takes a significant amount of time.  My guild has about<br/>
110<br/>
people (probably quite a few of those have quit the game not sure<br/>
exactly)<br/>
Exactly three of those people are level 60.<br/>
<br/>
Again - you are arguing about game balance only from your perspective.<br/>
Maybe you are strictly speaking of specific types of raids (Waking the<br/>
sleeper?) - but I&#39;m talking about Planes, Siren&#39;s Grotto; Western<br/>
Wastes,<br/>
Dragon Necropolis - and hopefully ToV soon.  My guild does those<br/>
regularly<br/>
and we wish we had more than one bard (me) above 50...<br/>
<br/>
The bardic resist is VITAL to these raids for guilds like mine own.<br/>
