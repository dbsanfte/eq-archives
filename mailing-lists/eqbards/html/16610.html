<div id="ygrps-yiv-55616419">You&#39;re a bard, don&#39;t solo. I found the best place for exp at level 24-27<br/>
was Mistmoore. I wizzed through these levels in a matter of days. Bards are<br/>
excellent in groups in Mistmoore as they can provide the invis song (for<br/>
train avoidance), healing and combat speed bonus&#39;s. There are plenty of<br/>
spawns in Mistmoore and in a good group you can get constant exp from<br/>
pulls. Stick to the wall on the side of the lake and you should avoid<br/>
trains. Gargoyles spawn on the bank with the tower and often they drops<br/>
Garg eyes (9pp each).<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, hope this info helps.<br/>
