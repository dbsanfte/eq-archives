<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359467301">was this patch message from the one going in today?  i hope so, because<br/>
actually a couple months back there was a similar patch message stating that<br/>
these songs were having their effects increased.  it was the same patch that<br/>
added the level 43 and 50 songs to the game.  there was a very small<br/>
increase in them, so hopefully this will make the songs useful, and<br/>
hopefully a drum will work with them.  they are all listed as percussion but<br/>
currently using a drum has no effect.  and one more compaint about these<br/>
songs hehe, i hope they aren&#39;t resisted as much as they currently are.<br/>

&gt; seriously, should a level 30 song take 5 minutes to<br/>
&gt; kill a rock dervish?<br/>
