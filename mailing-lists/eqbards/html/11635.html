<div id="ygrps-yiv-530862259">Finally, somebody mentioned it.  I chose a 1/2-elf, and live with wearing<br/>
only med armor, not getting hide or forage at 50 skill  to start, not<br/>
getting bash, not having a str at over 100 at lvl one, not having<br/>
ultravision, not being able to enter Neriak or Oggok or Ferrott, and not<br/>
being obnoxoiusly big...<br/>
<br/>
it was my choice... and I am way pro-choice.  Ohhh, that prolly isn&#39;t<br/>
approriate for this list.  hehehe... :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok, I play a Barbarian Shaman as well and I have a guise.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And I have to say here that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unfair that other races<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; equip it.  Have you ever tried to zone from Guk or Sol B when there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Troll, Ogre or Barbarian in your way?  As a Shaman, I can shrink, but<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the others, being small was of HUGE importance in a dungeon... not to<br/>
&gt; &gt; mention the ultravision benefit.  Anyway, I&#39;m fine with the change, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think it was necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Having difficulty maneuvering in dungeons, and not having<br/>
&gt; ultravision were supposed to be disadvantages of playing<br/>
&gt; certain races.<br/>
