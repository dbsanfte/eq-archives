&gt;What about if you have a SS helm and summon the Eye of Zomm?  Can you summon<br/>
&gt;the Eye, turn on the corpse locating song, and then lead the person to their<br/>
&gt;corpse with the Eye instead of going yourself?  This could be useful in<br/>
&gt;situations when you don&#39;t want to leave your party.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neat idea. I&#39;d guess that this wouldn&#39;t work, but who knows. Any idea what <br/>
the duration is of Eye of Zomm from the helm? I know my magician&#39;s Eye of <br/>
Zomm has a very short duration. Not sure it&#39;d stay around long enough to <br/>
help someone locate their corpse.<br/>
