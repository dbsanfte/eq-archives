&gt;   &quot;During last night&#39;s event, the Plane of Hate &#39;opened up a gate and let<br/>
&gt; forth it&#39;s minions&#39;.  It is not open as yet, however.  This is just a<br/>
&gt; preview of things to come.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am almost sure that the plane is open for two reasons.  A GM mentioned<br/>
that the plane is open and the fact that Fennin Ro server has already<br/>
travelled to the zone.  Hopefully I am right, as it is due time that they<br/>
gave the level 50s somethign to do so they can level us level 20-30 alone<br/>
in our dungeons =)<br/>
