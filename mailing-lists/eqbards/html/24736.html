<div id="ygrps-yiv-305861305">Must say, I&#39;ve been using your spreadsheet for a while now, it&#39;s nice having <br/>
all that info on just 2 pages.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to mention a couple things...  I just dinged 53 tonight, and I <br/>
can say with a certainty, the level 53 song, Song of Twilight, definitely <br/>
does not require an instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Also, are you sure that the 54 song Villa&#39;s Verses of Celerity and 55 <br/>
Cantata of Replenishment are targetted and not group songs?  I thought they <br/>
changed Jonathan&#39;s Provocation because they didn&#39;t like giving bards <br/>
targetted (ie. not self and not group) buffs.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, great work on the spreadsheet...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;For those who use it, my latest bard song calculator spreadsheet is<br/>
&gt;available.  (It&#39;s an Excell spreadsheet that calculates numbers given<br/>
&gt;level and instruments).  It should be up at Rokenn&#39;s site shortly<br/>
&gt;(www.eqsongs.com) but until then, you can get it here:<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The main changes are some more sets of numbers have been added, and<br/>
&gt;lots of song to song incompatibilities have been added.  See the<br/>
&gt;Documentation sheet for details.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you have any comments or modifications (or questions ;), please e-<br/>
&gt;mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqreed@...">eqreed@...</a>.  Enjoy!<br/>
