<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-705472456">The experience thing, although this has probably already been answered, has<br/>
nothing to do with the level of group members but with the level of the mob<br/>
in relation to the player. This is in reference to the person being able to<br/>
get experience at all. If I remember correctly the mob must be within at<br/>
most 1/3 of your level.. ie a level 24 character must kill a mob levels<br/>
17-32 in order to get xp. 8 levels on either side.<br/>
 The amount of experience given to that player for the group kill is<br/>
dependant upon the raltionship of the level difference between the group<br/>
members. As far as the amount of xp given the character gets his level<br/>
proportion of xp as it would be divided within the group irregardless of<br/>
whether the other group member are within the level range to gain experience<br/>
themselves.. IE a level 50 player and a level 20 player.. 50+20 is 70<br/>
therefore the level 20 player get 2/7 of the experience for the mob if the<br/>
mob is within 1/3 his levels. The exception to this is I believe until level<br/>
15 you can gain exp for anything within 5 levels regardless of level.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree with Thormeal here - I have a level 33 ranger that has been<br/>
grouped<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a level 9 paladin for a few days (doing a quest) and I will say<br/>
that if<br/>
&gt; &gt; I kill something green to me, he will not get exp if we are grouped.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The confusion comes because if HE kills something, and I assist in no<br/>
way in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fight (I assume bard songs would be considered assisting, but I did<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt; with my ranger so can&#39;t say for sure) he will get the exp he normally<br/>
would,<br/>
&gt; &gt; even if we are grouped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is more in line with what I&#39;ve observed.  Who does the<br/>
&gt; most damage in group (would get the kill if not grouped) seems<br/>
&gt; to be a factor in whether or not someone too low level gets<br/>
&gt; experience.<br/>
