&gt; If they continue to insist I play the Jig, I tell them that would require me<br/>
&gt; to replace one of the eight songs that could actually benefit the group.  If<br/>
&gt; they continue to insist I sing Jig, then I will leave the group.  Their<br/>
&gt; peace of mind does not outweigh my desire to not die.  Losing a valuable<br/>
&gt; song slot to play Jig when I know it has no effect increases my chance of<br/>
&gt; dying.  Also, I never tell anyone how to play their character.  Therefore, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t appreciate it when someone who has never played a bard tells me how to<br/>
&gt; play mine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In any area where the MOBs take a long time to take down, I usually have Jig <br/>
memorized.  If my fatigue bar gets to 1/2, it&#39;s pretty certain that the tanks <br/>
are down, also, and I really don&#39;t want to suffer the speed penalties of group <br/>
fatigue in an extended fight, so I twist it in for awhile.  Even in other <br/>
circumstances, I will swap Jig in during downtime between fights if requested.  <br/>
Why not, if it makes people feel better.  I don&#39;t think that we require all <br/>
eight slots to be full of precisely the right songs in order to win fights, and <br/>
I&#39;ve never died thinking to myself &quot;if only I had song X memorized, I would have <br/>
lived&quot;.  I&#39;ve died for 100 other reasons (at least)!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
As for your second point, I *always* tell other people how to play their <br/>
characters, especially if they are unused to Bards.  I&#39;ve died FAR more often <br/>
from other player&#39;s lack of playing sophistication than from having the Jig <br/>
memorized.  I do try to make my instruction impersonal and non-judgemental, but <br/>
I would be a fool to assume that other players know what they&#39;re doing.  <br/>
(Actually, I&#39;ve been that fool many times over, I just finally learned the <br/>
lesson.)<br/>
<br/>
And yes, if they are NOT being impersonal and non-judgemental, I DO leave.  Even <br/>
if they are mistaken in thinking that I&#39;m an idiot (I leave that to others to <br/>
judge), I don&#39;t want to fight with a group that believes that that is the case.<br/>
