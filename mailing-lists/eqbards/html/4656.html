<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525832130">I was looking into the same thing.  I came to the conclusion that all the<br/>
laptops currently available have horrible 3d acceleration (3d acceleration<br/>
is required for EverQuest).  There are two new chipset coming out soon for<br/>
laptops, one from S3, and one from ATI which should laregly alleviate this<br/>
problem.  I decided to wait for one of these.  ATI currently makes one that<br/>
is in Dell laptops, but it is fairly poor at 3d.  The new S3 chipset looks<br/>
the most impressive, based off the savage 4.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as your borders around the edges of the screen, some laptops can do<br/>
scaling to scale the 640x480 up to the real LCD screen size, but it looks<br/>
really ugly.  But if you got one of the newer laptops with the new S3<br/>
chipset, you could simply run at the full resolution of the display<br/>
(typically 1024x768 these days).  <br/>
<br/>
My laptop plans got aborted, because I decided I needed to get a new car<br/>
before my current one falls apart.<br/>

sit on your laptop, I don&#39;t know you that well!&quot;<br/>

&gt;I believe this months PC Magazine can still be bought on the news stand.  It<br/>
&gt;has some information on new laptops.  It also has a review of EverQuest,<br/>
&gt;getting 4 out of 5 stars.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I&#39;m looking into buying a laptop and obviously it has to run EverQuest<br/>
&gt;&gt;reasonably well.  Does anyone have experience with laptops and EverQuest,<br/>
&gt;&gt;or state-of-the-art games in general?<br/>
