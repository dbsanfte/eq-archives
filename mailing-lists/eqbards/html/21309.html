idea that some PK&#39;er could log in one day, walk out of his house and get<br/>
PK&#39;d by a random server generated assassin that would always know where he<br/>
was.  Talk about just desserts.  Just the idea of having a Venril Sathir<br/>
like mob jumping grief-causers when they were totally unprepared was<br/>
amusing.<br/>
