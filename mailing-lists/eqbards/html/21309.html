<div id="ygrps-yiv-815402082"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Grief PKing was &quot;solved&quot; by creating a complete duplicate of the UO<br/>
&gt;world where pking is not allowed at all. i.e. Adding a switch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think for me the most interesting part of the Horizons solution was the<br/>
idea that some PK&#39;er could log in one day, walk out of his house and get<br/>
PK&#39;d by a random server generated assassin that would always know where he<br/>
was.  Talk about just desserts.  Just the idea of having a Venril Sathir<br/>
like mob jumping grief-causers when they were totally unprepared was<br/>
amusing.<br/>
