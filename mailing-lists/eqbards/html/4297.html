&gt; Let me ask you this.. If you worked hard at your job for <br/>
&gt; awhile trying to<br/>
&gt; move up the ladder and then someone that had just started a <br/>
&gt; few days ago got<br/>
&gt; a position (or the window desk you wanted, or better pay or <br/>
&gt; whatever) higher<br/>
&gt; up than you just because their friend was influential with <br/>
&gt; the upper-ups -<br/>
&gt; would it bother you? Of course it would. Sure, EQ is just a <br/>
&gt; game - but you<br/>
&gt; spend &quot;real life&quot; time playing it and earning things. The <br/>
&gt; person that got<br/>
&gt; offered the above perk maybe would be foolish to turn it <br/>
&gt; down, but didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; earn it - and may not do as good of a job without the type of <br/>
&gt; experience<br/>
&gt; that you had gotten. (This is an example, and obviously isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; perfect - but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m simply trying to make a little point)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not flaming or trying to start any arguments, I just <br/>
&gt; thought a couple of<br/>
&gt; examples might help you see why some of us disagree. There&#39;s <br/>
&gt; probably no<br/>
&gt; clear line as to what&#39;s right and when.. </span></blockquote></div>
