&gt;My level 14 rogue is engaged in a virtual duel via email with a level 45<br/>
&gt;wizard.  She&#39;s not out to kill me, just to get an item back.  Currently I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;immobilized and she&#39;s sitting a little ways in front of me medding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My thought was to shoot an arrow and a skeleton that just spawned behind<br/>
&gt;her, then evade and hope that it would attack the medding 45 wizard in it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;path before continuing on to me.  (I want it to stun her so I can flee<br/>
&gt;before she gets another root off)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What are the chances something like this would work in-game?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably not, since in order for a monster to switch targets, it needs to <br/>
have distance issues.  If you can&#39;t move farther from the wizard, that <br/>
skelly will just ignore her and move on to you.<br/>
<br/>
FYI 14 vs 45 - just give her the darn thing back.<br/>
