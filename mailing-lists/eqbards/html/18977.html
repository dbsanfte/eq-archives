<br/>
I was in hate all weekend and it was just the straw that broke the camel&#39;s<br/>
back.  Just crap drops, and when it did drop, it was crap again.  I just<br/>
want Verant to look into their drop table for scorn banshees and play with<br/>
it so stuff DROPS.  Take pity and help as I bump the petition over the<br/>
course of hte next few days in hope of getting noticed.<br/>
