<div id="ygrps-yiv-407139480">Brad has addressed this and said they are opposed to it because it would<br/>
&quot;destroy the player economy&quot;.  A LOT of players would scream bloody<br/>
murder...<br/>

&gt; As an aside I wouldn&#39;t mind if they made all dropped items no drop.<br/>
&gt; Farming would be no more.  Everyone would earn their own items.  THis<br/>
&gt; way there would be little trouble with lvl 50&#39;s coming blitzing through<br/>
&gt; dungeons.  It still would happen (if they needed a certain item for<br/>
&gt; themself), but would not be common.<br/>
