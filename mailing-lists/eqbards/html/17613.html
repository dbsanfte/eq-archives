really wasn&#39;t meant to handle large scale battles.  That&#39;s one of the main<br/>
reasons when they upgrade a Dragon or a God the first things to get upped<br/>
are the AE effects, because they ignore the hate list and hurt everyone.<br/>

	In planes you can notice it in two ways.  One, bards dying more<br/>
than any other class, because the song ticking keeps them high on the<br/>
list.  Two, which I&#39;m not sure happens as much to bards because of reason<br/>
one, is the fact that my cleric gets a faction message about 1 in every 30<br/>
or so kills in hate, because normally I don&#39;t cast anything near the end<br/>
of a fight and I&#39;m not on the list, hence no faction hit.  If you get the<br/>
killing blow, on the other hand, you will * always * get a faction<br/>
message.<br/>

make a judgement call as to whether you&#39;re still on the hate list or not.<br/>
I successfully camped my clerics out against the Maestro despite being oom<br/>
and at 1 bubble of health during an attempt in which didn&#39;t even buff up<br/>
for (and hence Maestro reminded us we should know better and promptly<br/>
flattened us).<br/>
