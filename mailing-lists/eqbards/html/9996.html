<div id="ygrps-yiv-126884701">Okay let break it down ^_^.<br/>
<br/>
1. Charm the blue 4-5 in a row doinf the basic charm and then run away.<br/>
2. At this point you are at the very top of the shit list for this mob.<br/>
3. Now find a green mob that can attack the blue.<br/>
4. Charm it and get it to attack the blue mob.<br/>
5. At this point you will notice that the blue mob will be chasing you<br/>
ignoring the green that is attacking it.<br/>
6. Continue the charming of the greenie til the green kills the blue, the<br/>
blue kills the green (you would go to step 3 again)<br/>
<br/>
I have successfully used this to kill Griffennes with the help of friendly<br/>
Griffawns.  The only thing that you must be wary of are<br/>
<br/>
1.  If the creature is too green to the taget it will not attack it.<br/>
2.  Your pet will pick up other mobs so you will have to resort to running<br/>
in a circle to avoid picking up some extra mobs.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t understand what is being accomplished here guys.  Please explain it<br/>
&gt; using small words and speak slowly.  My base INT is only 75.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if you only have a uber blue and some greens.  Charm the blue a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few times.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He will now be agro against you and will ingnore you<br/>
&gt; &gt; completely.  Now find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a green mob that is as fast as the uber blue and charm it and get it to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; attack the uber blue.  What I found is a griffawn can take down a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; griffenne in about 4-5 charms on the Griffawn ^_^.  Got my charm in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; manner.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You know, this is really really clever.  I&#39;d been risking<br/>
&gt; &gt; death by tossing a Chain on the mob that I wanted to lose, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I like your method better.<br/>
