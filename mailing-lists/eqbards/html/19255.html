<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282496668">I am going to test this tonight.  I can boost my int up 150 from 90.  So if<br/>
there is an Int effect I should see it pretty easily.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to let her know there is no lvl 49 bard song though :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ok, Int DOES increace the amount of mana we bards have. At <br/>
&gt; the same time <br/>
&gt; &gt;it also effects our DOT songs (lvls 2,18,30,38,46,49) after <br/>
&gt; having int <br/>
&gt; &gt;higher that 100 increases damage by 5%. I think the next <br/>
&gt; magic number is <br/>
&gt; &gt;around 120ish then 144ish. I have not been able to get <br/>
&gt; enough int to test <br/>
&gt; &gt;these. But at 99 and less int lvl 30 38 and 46 songs with selos drum <br/>
&gt; &gt;played once in a twist does 315 dam at lvl 46. With 100 int <br/>
&gt; it did 331. <br/>
&gt; &gt;There are TWO songs at this point that use mana, lvl 39 <br/>
&gt; charm and lvl 43 <br/>
&gt; &gt;dirge. At lvl 43 a bard has just enough mana to play Dirge song once.<br/>
&gt; &gt;BTW - most parts to the bard planer armor has a int bonus <br/>
&gt; not a wis bonus. <br/>
&gt; &gt;Hmmm... could be a hint :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;My primary offense these days is in songs - Chant series and <br/>
&gt; when able the <br/>
&gt; &gt;CoD, DDD, CoC medly - with planar/dragon instruments.  So, <br/>
&gt; if int is a <br/>
&gt; &gt;good boost then I am gonna rob my wizzy twink of his int <br/>
&gt; gear!  &lt;j/k&gt; One <br/>
&gt; &gt;reason I give some creedence to this is the blurb in the <br/>
&gt; original user <br/>
&gt; &gt;manual that said INT was a component in bard song effectiveness.<br/>

&gt; this weekend <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway - she does seem to know what she&#39;s doing...<br/>
