<div id="ygrps-yiv-324586972">Hmm either I misunderstood your post or you misunderstood brad&#39;s. When this<br/>
is implemented and you pull with a dot spell it will no longer do damage<br/>
because it will be chasing after you.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; we will most likely also slightly increase<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the durations of DoT spells to compensate for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the additional time necessary to cast the spells<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So it&#39;s also going to take LONGER to cast DoT spells?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The reports I have in so far basically say<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; if the  monster is out of your melee range<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it takes no damage.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So in other words, a group cosisting of a wizard and a<br/>
&gt;&gt; Shaman for example.. The wizard casts root on the mob<br/>
&gt;&gt; and then the Shaman poisons it. Darn, sorry - you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;&gt; not close enough to the monster, your DoT isn&#39;t going<br/>
&gt;&gt; to work?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; How *#*$ stupid can they get?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The whole point of a DoT is to poison something. If we<br/>
&gt;&gt; as players chase a mob that poisoned us, does OUR<br/>
&gt;&gt; poison stop? I bet I can tell you the answer to that<br/>
&gt;&gt; one rather quickly. Poison is poison. It&#39;s in the body,<br/>
&gt;&gt; it doesn&#39;t go away just because you have to chase<br/>
&gt;&gt; something. I don&#39;t normally kite (how boring) but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; totally against them changing the spells this drastically<br/>
&gt;&gt; for everyone just because some people do.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No, and 2 times NO.  You&#39;re worse than my fellow shaman!<br/>
&gt;/em rolls his eyes in exasperation!<br/>

&gt;BRAD ON THE DOT ISSUE - NO MORE KITING<br/>

&gt;The kiting fix has nothing to do with range.  Essentially, DoT spells do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;damage the NPC if the NPC is chasing you and has a velocity. If he is not<br/>
&gt;moving or he is fleeing from you, the DoT does damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IF we make this change live, and that&#39;s an IF at this point, we will most<br/>
&gt;likely also slightly increase  the durations of DoT spells to compensate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the additional time necessary to cast the spells and  then set up your<br/>
&gt;defense (you tanking, another player tanking, a pet tanking, etc).<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;********************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now this is in direct contradiction to what people CLAIM to have seen.<br/>
&gt;Two possibilities :<br/>
&gt;1.  There&#39;s a bug that&#39;s causing DoTs to fail outside of melee range<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(which,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;if you&#39;ll simply read the above is NOT the intent)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.  The caster is simply too distant to see the dropping health.  This is<br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt;likely in my experience.  I often use Tainted Breath to pull, so that the<br/>
&gt;mob<br/>
&gt;is taking damage while I pull it back.  (I&#39;ve changed to pulling with<br/>
&gt;drowsy,<br/>
&gt;then popping TB when I reach my fighting spot)  Often, you will not see<br/>
&gt;the mob&#39;s health drop when your a ways from the mob, this is a known issue<br/>
&gt;that a mob&#39;s health bar doesn&#39;t refresh if you&#39;re too far away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Secondly, the phrase &quot;Increase the durations of DoT spells&quot; means more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ticks<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of the poison hitting the mob, which will either increase overall damage,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;require less damage per pulse.  (undoing part of the change the made to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to make DoT&#39;s more group friendly)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as a RP reason for them to fail, how &#39;bout when you turn to run, you<br/>
&gt;lose control of the spell and it fails?  (too busy concentratiing on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>getting<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;away)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to have to copy this response to my clipboard, because sure as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;sitting here I&#39;ll see a LOT of this when I read the shaman list :(<br/>
