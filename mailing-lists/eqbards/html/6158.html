<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527818779">A well-played bard is ALWAYS useful to a group.  At 5th an excellent choice <br/>
for weaving is Chant of Battle and Chords of Dissounce.  Chant will boast <br/>
the parties AC, STR, and DEX.  Chords will damage all the critters you are <br/>
fighting.  Just besure to use the 3rd person view to stop chords if an <br/>
unwanted guest (like a wandering guard) happens by.  At 6th you will have <br/>
hymn of restoration which will make your cleric and tanks love you even <br/>
more.<br/>
