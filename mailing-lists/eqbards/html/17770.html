<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lavastorm bug <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232674237">I have found Lavastorm to be very buggy when zoning in and out of it.  I<br/>
have zoned out of Najena into a pool of lava.  The guide didn&#39;t bat an eye<br/>
about rezzing me so I figured it must happen quite often.  I also had an odd<br/>
occurance happen last night.  I was zoning from Nektulos and had a couple<br/>
guards on me.  and while zoning was disconnected several times.  When I<br/>
finally got back in I was in the NE corner of the zone rather than by the<br/>
zone line.  I have only had this happen when zoning from Oasis and dropping<br/>
in near the grassy section of N Ro.  <br/>
