<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-237514693">I consider myself Adequate as a bard but people in my guild who&#39;ve been<br/>
  around 90% of the bards on the server keep telling me that I&#39;m the best<br/>
bard<br/>
  they&#39;ve grouped with.  &quot;You never sing less than 3 or 4 songs, you know<br/>
when<br/>
  to switch and you are always where you&#39;re needed most&quot;.  In short, I pay<br/>
  attention to what&#39;s going on.  I also never twist between fights.  They<br/>
get<br/>
  mana song, or heal song.  Depending on how badly the tanks are hurt and<br/>
how<br/>
  bad the casters need mana.  If it&#39;s REAL bad I&#39;ll twist but between fights<br/>
  they like me to tell them stories ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  - WOW *dreams of a lag free connection to the us* I guess that makes me a<br/>
crappy bard because I can do two songs?<br/>
