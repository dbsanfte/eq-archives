<div id="ygrps-yiv-862141542">Decided to move to an upcoming topic of many future digests - SoV.  I hope<br/>
to pick up my copy today at EB in a nearby mall (preordered a while back and<br/>
if not able to talk my way into a copy today, then tomorrow).  So, my<br/>
questions:<br/>
<br/>
How do you get there?  Reading the 12 days of Velious on the main EQ site,<br/>
it seems to say Odus.  Here is the statement:  &quot;We have received recent<br/>
reports from Ak`Anon that a new continent has been discovered.  New marine<br/>
technology recently developed by the gnomes enabled the Ak`Anon Marines to<br/>
break through the Frigid Barrier to the south of Odus and in doing so, they<br/>
discovered lands previously unknown.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What race do you plan on aligning with?  I think my guild is going to<br/>
definitely align with the Coldain Dwarves by initially killing giants.<br/>
Dragons will probably be left alone, at least for a bit.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone looked into the latest patches to see what they contain if more<br/>
than just new character models?<br/>
<br/>
Any other good information out there?  Email threads on one of the forums?<br/>
Inside info from test?  Looking forward to finding out what you know.<br/>
