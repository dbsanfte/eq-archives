<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226790993">There was some disagreement over whether the attack slowdown<br/>
from these two stacked so I timed them again.  I picked a mob<br/>
(a giant fire beetle) and let it beat on me while I timed how<br/>
long it took for it to make 10 attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Normal: 30.1 sec, 30.2 sec<br/>
Chain: 38.4 sec, 37.9sec<br/>
Binding: 38.2 sec, 38.2 sec<br/>
Chain + Binding: 37.8 sec, 38.2 sec<br/>
<br/>
Slowdown is about 25%, and they most definitely do not stack.<br/>
I&#39;ll test it with the enchanter&#39;s spells next time I meet one<br/>
of my enchanter friends.<br/>
