<div id="ygrps-yiv-124776816">When this happens, press the &#39;Escape&#39; key so that you have nothing <br/>
targeted.  With target based songs getting stuck, this is the best <br/>
cure I&#39;ve found.  You get a message that you need a target for that <br/>
song to work (or something like that) and then it will finally end.  <br/>
Also, you won&#39;t waste mana ;)  This seems to happen to me a lot when <br/>
I&#39;m duoing the root/chants with friends.  I just press escape, wait <br/>
for the next pulse so that it stops, and then re-target and start <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar note, I love using the Root/Chant tactic.  I am able to <br/>
use my second &#39;puter and get some kick ass exp for me and a friend <br/>
when they aren&#39;t around ;)  This makes driving 2 players lots of fun <br/>
and easy.<br/>
