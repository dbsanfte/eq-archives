<div id="ygrps-yiv-774678133">I think that&#39;s it.  It&#39;s not like bards actually have all that many quests<br/>
to be broken to begin with.  So why is it that those are open stories???<br/>
Sounds like a BS reply to quests they never got around to finishing.  Both<br/>
Sunsa and Vhalen have had those text messages since pretty close to day one<br/>
of Live if not before.  Some people have had those troll guts in their<br/>
inventories or bank for over a year.  Sorry, but I don&#39;t buy it.<br/>

The &quot;Broken Quest Issues&quot; are not broken quests. They are preexisting<br/>
stories for future expansion.<br/>
*Not sure if this applies to Fabian or not.<br/>
<br/>
So... we have (to the best of my memory) an NPC that mentions an instrument,<br/>
but there is no quest (Qeynos); an NPC that offers a bard weapon, but there<br/>
is no quest (Temple of Sol); and a quest that involves telling a low 20&#39;s<br/>
druid (the hermit in SK) &quot;I&#39;ll kill you&quot; (or use AE song on him) to get him<br/>
out of his house in order to get the quest items from his corpse, which<br/>
eventually results in a few silver, some exp, and a random level 1-4 song.<br/>
Other than those, what other bard quests need looking into?<br/>
