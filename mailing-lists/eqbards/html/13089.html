&gt; (had to keep it pixied while a pallie medded and healed himself). After the<br/>
&gt; first failure, I had no reason not to switch to a flute, so I did.  My<br/>

Pixie Striking myself.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Resisted about half the time (my normal MR is 61), stunned<br/>
2 times, got the &quot;you send forth music&quot; message with no effect<br/>
about 8 times.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Ok, switch to the flute.  Still resisted about half the<br/>
time, stunned about 6 times, no effect about 3 times.  Wow,<br/>
maybe there&#39;s something to this theory.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Then I unequipped the flute again.  Resisted about half<br/>
the time, stunned 11 times, no effect 2 times.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
The only other thing I can think of is that I think I had<br/>
weapons equipped the first time, and my MM drum equiped the<br/>
third time.  GZ mentioned something about some instruments<br/>
being focus objects.  Maybe the MM drum has that effect.  I<br/>
will have to test it some more with the log on so I can get<br/>
exact counts.<br/>
