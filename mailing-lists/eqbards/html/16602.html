<div id="ygrps-yiv-515037709">I don&#39;t see the one I&#39;d sent to your erols email address, so I guess I&#39;ll <br/>
send it here...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Talies&#39; Dance of the Dead - Party-only, Wind Instrument<br/>
Targeted player&#39;s corpse, if within range (limited to about 100 feet or so, <br/>
of course) gets up and walks to it&#39;s owner (Owner<br/>
must be within &quot;heal&quot; range of the Bard)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Purpose: To assist retrieving corpses from lava, under the world, or other <br/>
inaccessible places.  By making it a party-only spell, it would prevent <br/>
exploiting.  By making it a very short distance, it keeps the necromancer&#39;s <br/>
spell very valuable - I mean, if your corpse is underneath Vox, what would <br/>
you rather do, have it summoned or sneak within 100 feet and hope she <br/>
doesn&#39;t see you? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
