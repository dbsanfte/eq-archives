<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone noticed that stamina is now draining from us while running with<br/>
&gt; Accelerando?  I was just running through SK and found my stamina bar rapidly<br/>
&gt; decreasing.. I have never seen that except when running and jumping, or<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always figured this was just due to the song getting faster<br/>
as you level.  Running all the way across West Karana has<br/>
always taken about a bubble of stamina, and still does (as of<br/>
about 2 weeks ago).  It just takes less time for me to cross<br/>
the distance now, so you lose stamina faster over time, but<br/>
it&#39;s the same stamina drain for the distance covered.<br/>
