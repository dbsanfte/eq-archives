<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725939012">last time i was there,i was told the same thing.  the consensus was to sing<br/>
away until the monk went to pull, then all bards stopped singing.  no idea<br/>
if it means anything, but better to keep everyone happy and keep the bards<br/>
out of blame for trains =)  i haven&#39;t been there since the feign death<br/>
changes, so don&#39;t know how that changes the pulling strategy, but everytime<br/>
i have been there it was a monk pulling and an enchanter scouting.<br/>
<br/>
we have yet to see any imbrued in hate yet either, all bards that have any<br/>
got it from fear.  good luck on either a rapier, or those beautiful weps on<br/>
our favorite guy the maestro.<br/>

p.s. 19/29 drool, i hope it wasn&#39;t bard!  then i don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
not having one =)<br/>

&gt; No luck yet for me yet. I have been told that singing NO <br/>
&gt; songs in there <br/>
&gt; greatly reduces training, but this is not verified. I&#39;m still <br/>
&gt; debating that <br/>
&gt; as the first time I went it was well over an hour before we <br/>
&gt; got trained and <br/>
&gt; that train was caused by some idiot who wanted to SEE what <br/>
&gt; the zone looked <br/>
&gt; like.. *sigh*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We did have to let some nice rogue armor decay (I hate that), <br/>
&gt; and one of our <br/>
&gt; pally&#39;s got a nice 2 hander (20 dmg 36 delay I believe).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Couple bards on my server do have Evensong and 6 Notes, but <br/>
&gt; they got their <br/>
&gt; imbrued sets from the original Fear (right after it opened). <br/>
&gt; Innoruuk (sp?) <br/>
&gt; was killed last week and dropped a 9/18 ROG only poker, and a <br/>
&gt; 19/29 1 hand <br/>
&gt; slasher (don&#39;t remember what classes can use, but I do not <br/>
&gt; believe Bard was <br/>
&gt; included).<br/>
