&gt; I have heared many people mention that Selo&#39;s no longer breaks root.  Now I<br/>
&gt; thought that might be wrong, because I was breaking Ghoul Root, in Unrest<br/>
&gt; and Oasis, 2 days after the patch that caused it.  Even after doing this<br/>
&gt; probably a half a dozen times.  I chalked it up to conisidence.  But last<br/>
&gt; night I was fighting Orcs in Highpass, and I got rooted a couple of times<br/>
&gt; from... it was either Fanatic or Medic... when I clicked Selos&#39;s just to<br/>
&gt; see, both times I was released right when I got the boot symbol.  Has anyone<br/>
&gt; else noticed this.  Or has anyone else been unable to get unrooted?  Am I<br/>
&gt; just really lucky, or perhaps someone has an explanation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it possible they fully fleshed this out and made it<br/>
level-dependent whether or not Accel breaks root?  The code is<br/>
already there for the invisibility stuff - kodiaks could see<br/>
through my enchanter&#39;s invisibility until he reached level 15,<br/>
which is approximately their average level.  So maybe Accel<br/>
will break a root cast on you by a lower level mob, but not a<br/>
higher level mob?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to talk my friends into visiting the arena some<br/>
time...<br/>
