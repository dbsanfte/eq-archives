<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817404202">This is a problem now.  Level 50 over crowding is here now.  The guilds on<br/>
Innoruuk who can do these raids and runs _do_ communicate and try to<br/>
coordinate.  Not withstanding there is the _Strong_ competitive spirit<br/>
between them.  The members need to trust their leaders and abide to the<br/>
agreements.   On a couple occasions, there have been one or 2 problems and<br/>
that&#39;s when GM&#39;s step in.  Granted - there&#39;s a lot of stuff that gets posted<br/>
and flamed and it&#39;s usually far from what is really happening between the<br/>
guild leaders.<br/>
<br/>
Some competition is indeed healthy - a lot of cooperation will make things<br/>
work for everyone.  <br/>

Subject:	[eqbards] Here&#39;s a clip from the elite Innoruuk guild.<br/>
<br/>
Caveat:  It will probably be six months before I&#39;m high enough level to go<br/>
on a dragon raid so the topic of this thread has no impact on me whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Opinion:  Until Verant comes up with something for all the level 50s to do,<br/>
this type of conflict between high level guilds on every server is gonna get<br/>
a helluva lot worse.  I can see in the near future where guilds will have to<br/>
start using a waiting list, schedule, etc that every guild must abide by.<br/>
Full time GM required to make sure everyone plays by the rules (don&#39;t<br/>
laugh:-)  Maybe a modified version of the /yield rule for guilds??<br/>
<br/>
Short term solution?:  To promote a &quot;community&quot; atmosphere, why don&#39;t the<br/>
high level guilds try cooperating with other guilds on a trial basis.<br/>
Perhaps agree to limit each guild to having one full group participate.<br/>
Have four guilds participate and you get the magic number of 24 people<br/>
fighting the dragon that everyone seems to think is the best number to<br/>
handle lag. <br/>

PS  Wonder how many of the players who act the way mentioned below, no<br/>
matter what guild they are in, fall into the stereotype category of<br/>
&quot;powergamer&quot;?  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 	To many, such practices seem &quot;elitist&quot;.  I can definitely<br/>
&gt; understand why someone would think that, some of my guildmates do act with<br/>
&gt; that kind of attitude.  But there IS a logical reason for not inviting<br/>
&gt; outside people, in addition to the fact that inter-guild co-ordination is<br/>
&gt; alot of work.<br/>
