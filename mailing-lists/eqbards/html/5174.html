<div id="ygrps-yiv-980138903">Look, I for one am getting tired of the nay-sayers on this missed note<br/>
thing. Last night I couldnt even get Denons to start I missed notes 10 times<br/>
in a row and finally erased it from my list and added a different song. ALL<br/>
my skills are over 190, my Dex is a base of 124, char is 110, there is a<br/>
problem. I am a level 38 Bard and I KNOW when something has changed with the<br/>
way I play. So knock off the black helicopter crap, you dont have a clue<br/>
what your talking about. This is a very serious problem in how the Bard is<br/>
played, it means we cannot twist songs like we used to effectively. I cannot<br/>
depend on Chaining a fleeing mob like I used to be able to. In fact I find<br/>
myself anticipating that missed note, hovering over that hotkey waiting to<br/>
push it again when I miss. Its too bad if you dont play enough to notice a<br/>
huge change like this, or arent observant enough to notice it, but dont tell<br/>
us we are imagining things.<br/>

Tested with a bard who just turned 36th:<br/>
<br/>
Clarity (32): 4/100<br/>
Accelerando (5): 3/100<br/>
Chant (1): 3/100<br/>
Celerity (36): 15/100<br/>
<br/>
Celerity&#39;s higher failure rate is reasonable, given that the Singing skill<br/>
isn&#39;t maxed for the level yet.  As I suggest, run the numbers for yourself.<br/>
Now go back to looking for the black helicopters.<br/>
