&gt;I can verify that this is true.  I&#39;ve been fighting a lot in Solusek B<br/>
&gt;lately, and regularily charm pets so that we don&#39;t have to bother killing<br/>
&gt;them.  When the master is still alive, you are greeted with the message<br/>
&gt;&quot;That NPC cannot be charmed&quot;.  Once the master is dead, no problem.<br/>
&gt;Another thing to note, the pet often won&#39;t suicide if there are other MOBS<br/>
&gt;around, even if they&#39;re not the master.<br/>

course) is around then the bard can do it. If there are still a few other<br/>
mobs around, then have an sk/necro/enchanter/whatever do it. The pet just<br/>
wanders off to die, and not once has it ever pulled anything back in a<br/>
dungeon for us. <br/>
