<div id="ygrps-yiv-865253063">hello all <br/>
I am new to the list (like the last few days)...and unfortunately I<br/>
think I missed this message that he is referring to saying thanks for<br/>
the tip.  would someone be so kind as to repeat it or even send it to<br/>
me privately?  I would be most interested as I love to fight in the<br/>
Rathe mountains but I have yet to ever make that kind of money....what<br/>
are you doing?  As well I should point out that I am a druid but I just<br/>
started a bard and I love her.  she just made level 6 and I think that<br/>
the best thing about being a bard is having something to look forward<br/>
to at each level instead of every 5 like most classes.  I thank you all<br/>
for your indulgence.<br/>

&gt; hills here to get giants to spawn.  I made over 350pp there<br/>
&gt; tonight, and each of my friends there made over 200pp (I was<br/>
&gt; soloing a couple hours before the others showed up).  I think<br/>
&gt; my guild raked in close to 2000pp for the night, as well as 8<br/>
&gt; or 9 lambent stones.  Now if they&#39;ll just fix Genni...<br/>

&gt; This place is a high level bard&#39;s dream.  Lots of open space<br/>
&gt; to run around in, great cash loot, merchants nearby so you can<br/>
&gt; sell the heavy weapons, etc.  The only down side was that I<br/>
&gt; died once.  I had two giants fighting each other, then charm<br/>
&gt; was resisted 4 times in a row, I accidently let Accelerando<br/>
&gt; drop, and got chain-stunned 3 times, which was long enough for<br/>
&gt; both giants to kill me.  My group wasn&#39;t able to get within<br/>
&gt; range to heal me in time.<br/>
