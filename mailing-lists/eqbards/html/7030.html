<div id="ygrps-yiv-752177294">My opinion is that it is very inappropriate for Bards to get &quot;bind&quot;, even if<br/>
it were self-only.  We already are the fastest overland movers in the game.<br/>
If we had bind we would be unbalanced in that when we die, corpse retrieval<br/>
for us would be simpler than for any other class.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m interested in the binding song...and I agree that it is unlikely to be<br/>
&gt; approved.  However, here&#39;s my 2 cp:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 14 level is an appropriate level to be able to bind.  This matches the<br/>
classes<br/>
&gt; that can bind, as clerics are the last to get it at 14th.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The magic model for the Bard class is for us to have prettty much one or two<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; each type of spell.  We have a little speed, DoT, teleport, DD, Heal, etc.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; only powers we dont have are lifetap or bind.  I don&#39;t think lifetap fits<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; the Bardic image, so bind looks good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other hybrids don&#39;t get bind...but we aren&#39;t really a hybrid class.<br/>
Each<br/>
&gt; other hybrid is a warrior/specific magic class.  As a result, they get magic<br/>
&gt; plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told, then perhaps we can<br/>
get a<br/>
&gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, bind would be my vote...<br/>
