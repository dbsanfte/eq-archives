&gt; In Tallon Zek, the race war server, bards and enchanters will own when all<br/>
&gt; is said and done at lv 50, least until christmas&#39; expansion.  There are two<br/>
&gt; primary tactics that will prove deadly in pvp.  First, you can charm/make<br/>
&gt; them attack a high level mob, and then zone.  When you&#39;re wiped off of the<br/>
&gt; hatelist all that is left is your pet and the mob, and the mob will not stop<br/>
&gt; attacking the PC.  Second, there&#39;s the fear, chains combo, in which the PC<br/>
&gt; is entirely helpless as they walk slowly around the zone while you whack<br/>
&gt; them from behind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has anyone actually tried chain and fear in PvP? I did in the arena with<br/>
a warrior friend and it was resisted so often as to be useless. At the<br/>
time I was L47 with charisma of 113 and he was a L45 warrior with a<br/>
magic resist of 10 or 15. (whatever the base troll warrior magic resist<br/>
is) He even took off his resist boosting items to help see if it made a<br/>
difference) We also found that jboots break chaining. Sung fear was<br/>
resisted close to 80% of the time, while with a horn it was resisted<br/>
like 50%. But if you use a horn, what are you going to hit them with?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found for PvP, all our songs are resisted heavily by PC chars, even<br/>
ones 4 levels below us, far more often than they are by mobs. If I was<br/>
going to play on a PvP+ server, I think I&#39;d play a naked mage, just like<br/>
everyone else. :)<br/>
