<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183921791">They were easy to get if you started the game at the beginning.   People had<br/>
1000&#39;s of them scattered everywhere, stashed in castles, and in banks of all<br/>
their &#39;mule&#39; characters.  So what if they lost them?  You answered the<br/>
question yourself - they were easy to get (just go kill someone that has<br/>
them).  I like the fact that I can spend my money on something and keep it<br/>
until I want to get rid of it.  Not on a whim of a SnotBoy or KewlDuuude, or<br/>
an NPC that wants what I have.  I don&#39;t think EQ missed it, I think EQ got<br/>
it right for the majority of people.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Most people don&#39;t realize it, but a lot of the enjoyment of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the game is the anticipation just before you loot something -<br/>
&gt; &gt;will it or won&#39;t it have a nice item?  I once modified the<br/>
&gt; &gt;source of an RPG so I could start off with the best stuff.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;It made the game really boring - the item drops didn&#39;t matter<br/>
&gt; &gt;because I already had the best stuff, so all that was left was<br/>
&gt; &gt;endlessly killing monsters for experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think though that if less emphasis were placed on gathering items and<br/>
&gt; accumulating wealth in EQ, more emphasis would be put on the social aspect<br/>
&gt; of it.  I hate to use UO as an example but in this case it serves as a<br/>
&gt; beautiful example.  It just had something EQ missed.  When you died you<br/>
&gt; could count on losing every item you had been carrying on you, and no<br/>
&gt; particular item was THE item that you HAD to have to stay competitive,<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; were all relatively easy to get.  So instead of being obligated to sit<br/>
&gt; someplace for hours and hours on end, you might be able to entertain<br/>
&gt; yourself or others in the local tavern, or magic shop.  This was SO off<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; subject, just gave me something to type about  -=)   Thanks<br/>
