<div id="ygrps-yiv-808574879">Ummm, Sylly? - or are you replying to me?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve yet to get a piece of bronze - still in all banded which I bought one<br/>
piece at a time as I could afford it. Don&#39;t even WANT bronze, too dang<br/>
heavy for little ole woodelf me.<br/>
<br/>
And yeah - the little things are what *I* enjoy - I only bash monsters when<br/>
I have to. My motivations and enjoyment is almost the exact opposite of<br/>
what Verant obviously thinks folks &#39;should&#39; be wanting to do.<br/>

&gt;You were, and still Are, running around in full bronze plate at way to low<br/>
&gt;a level, but since you are such a nice person, I dont mind. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That and Ive seen you many times and you havent gone from 9-30 in 3 weeks. <br/>
&gt;you seem to get enjoyment from the little things and I like that....<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hehhe, in my original reply - I think something has been misunderstood<br/>
&gt;&gt; along the way.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not against helping a new character a LITTLE - little patchwork,<br/>
&gt;maybe<br/>
&gt;&gt; a mino axe (easy and cheap enough to come by) few plat to ease the<br/>
&gt;initial<br/>
&gt;&gt; startup pain - and knowing an area is a HUGE plus on a second character.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I was outraged by lvl 1&#39;s in better stuff than I expect to have at lvl<br/>
&gt;30,<br/>
&gt;&gt; maybe even 40.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s just over the top. Now, if they had this stuff - and banked it for<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&gt; few levels, I wouldn&#39;t have NEARLY as much trouble with that.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m just amazed Verant found a way for it not to matter all that much -<br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt;&gt; I see these guys dead on a regular basis. It&#39;s nice to know character<br/>
&gt;&gt; development apparently counts for a LOT more than &#39;stuff&#39;, even stuff as<br/>
&gt;&gt; nice as that. </span></blockquote></div>
