&gt; Hmm, the first thing I do when we have to bail is start up<br/>
&gt; Screech and stand next to the casters until they all manage to<br/>
&gt; gate.  Heck, I&#39;ve even stood next to one long enough for her<br/>
&gt; to memorize gate, then cast it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm. This must have been before your wizard got group gate I guess. I&#39;ve<br/>
done the same thing to clear the area long enough for a caster to get<br/>
group gate off (does anyone actually use evac or succor?) But, I&#39;ll<br/>
never forget the time I tried this in the undead tower in lower guk.<br/>
Something was beating on our druid as he tried to cast a group gate so I<br/>
fired up fear to try to clear a space. It wasn&#39;t even 3 seconds later<br/>
that most of the tower, including the gargoyles from way out by the<br/>
drawbridge were on our butts. Unfortunately the ghoul beating on the<br/>
druid resisted so the druid died, followed by the whole rest of the<br/>
party about 30 secs later.<br/>
