<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670882806"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Let&#39;s face it, bards are best at low level.  I was talking to a higher<br/>
&gt;level bard, Uulas, 22nd level, and he said he NEVER uses any songs from<br/>
&gt;13th level - 18th level.  Good old Anthem de Arms and Hymn of Restoration<br/>
&gt;with a bit of the Bellow are it, pretty much.  Don&#39;t just ignore his<br/>
&gt;advice, either, he is widely regarded as one of the best bards and an<br/>
&gt;excellent party member on this server.  I have heard it said that &quot;Uulas<br/>
&gt;could make any group good.&quot;  Looking over the bard song list, only the<br/>
&gt;invisibility, flight, and mana regeneration spells look that much<br/>
&gt;different from what we already have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uulas is correct.  My most frequently used songs (in melee areas) are Anthem<br/>
and the mana song, with bellow and chains right behind them.  Getting into<br/>
or out of areas brings in the invis song and of course, our dear<br/>
accellerando song.  For getting out of trouble fast, the screech song.  I<br/>
get a lot of requests for the charm song, but for me, it is unreliable<br/>
(never put enough time into using it so that it would be reliable).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So, to all of us who are hoping to hit the higher levels someday: don&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;down about it, but bards don&#39;t make a good &quot;core&quot; party member.  We just<br/>
&gt;make any party MUCH BETTER.  Last night I hooked up with a cleric, a<br/>
&gt;wizard, and a rogue.  Almost the perfect group, right?  Tank, nuke, and<br/>
&gt;heals.  With me in there, the efficiency skyrocketed.  We fought a solid 2<br/>
&gt;hours with perhaps 10 minutes of down time.  We were taking little to no<br/>
&gt;damage, mowing through the beetles and lesser undead in Unrest like a<br/>
&gt;Catholic priest who was also the Orkin man. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess that&#39;s my main point.  Not a CORE member, but one heck of an<br/>
&gt;accessory.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that was a point I was trying to make earlier when I said bards are<br/>
never &quot;required&quot; in a group, like a tank or a healer.  Even nukes are not<br/>
really required if a group knows what they are doing and has one healer for<br/>
every 2 tanks.<br/>
