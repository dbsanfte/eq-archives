 </span></blockquote>Once you reach about level 18+, go to Blackburrow.  Wait for a<br/>
nice, juicy train to come to the zone.  Hit lullaby.  You can<br/>
and will sleep much more than 4 gnolls.<br/>
<br/>
Other songs seem to be limited to 4 targets though.  Screech<br/>
(fear) is a good example.  Play it after you&#39;ve stopped the<br/>
above train and only 4 mobs will run per tick.  If you are<br/>
ever soloing and find a camp with more than 4 mobs and try to<br/>
pull them all, only 4 will engage, the rest will stand back<br/>
waiting until one dies or flees before engaging.<br/>
