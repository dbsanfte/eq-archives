<div id="ygrps-yiv-160390712">(I am 57 btw STILL)<br/>
<br/>
1 - agree<br/>
2 - agree<br/>
3 - Not used so much if you are using Symphonic Sabre, (BTW I am using a<br/>
Wrapped Entropy Serpent Spine - hehe I always did like having a whip!!). <br/>
Sometimes binding here, sometimes charm still depending on where we are.<br/>
4 - agree<br/>
5 - Where did Occlusion of Sound drop Shada?   I don&#39;t have this song and I<br/>
would love to get it.  I often use a buff song here, usually AC buff like March<br/>
of the Wee.<br/>
6 - agree<br/>
7 - So often we have a snarer and slower, so I put Fufil&#39;s Curtailing chant<br/>
here for extra damage.  I don&#39;t use one of the higher damage ones because I<br/>
like to debuff magic more.  BTW in Velious the three chant tactic is often<br/>
unuseable because so many mobs are very cold resistant.  It&#39;s frustrating at<br/>
times.<br/>
8 - Sometimes BBB (almost always with FCC to make sure it will stick),<br/>
sometimes an AOE (fun in DN - when we trip a spider trap we go to AOE hehe)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for screech - I don&#39;t use it inside anymore because it is resisted so much. <br/>
Also in the new lands you can outrun something&#39;s aggro radius much more easily.<br/>
 So sometimes SoT is a good getaway song - stop whatever it is in its tracks<br/>
and make a break for it.  But I do try to keep chains (binding) and fear up<br/>
when we are exploring or traveling.<br/>
<br/>
Oh incidently, I did use screech in DN the other night, and I outran aggro and<br/>
fired invis - and then Jaled Dar DTed me.  So I wondered if somehow I aggroed<br/>
by using it (I wasn&#39;t using an illusion).<br/>
<br/>
Oh and while I am rambling, I got Lullaby out to try and taunt so I could get<br/>
some defense improves - and it didn&#39;t work! *cry*  I am going to try it on the<br/>
next beetle trap pop I think heh.<br/>
<br/>
And a final thought - Wee and Rondo are fun &#39;You feel small&#39;  &#39;You are no<br/>
longer aroused&#39; heh<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1) Selo&#39;s (changes to Invis or Lull indoors)<br/>
&gt; 2) Cantana (never changes)<br/>
&gt; 3) Song of Dawn (changes to Resist song #2 or chant if needed)<br/>
&gt; 4) McVaxius Rousing Rondo (never changes)<br/>
&gt; 5) Occlusion of Sound (changes to Resist song #1 or chant if needed)<br/>
&gt; 6) Song of Twilight (never changes)<br/>
&gt; 7) Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding (never changes, been using 23 chains forever<br/>
&gt; because when i first got 51 binding i thought i remember it being a lower<br/>
&gt; slowdown)<br/>
&gt; 8) Screech (never changes, see below)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; any of the songs that are not &quot;never changes&quot; of course i can swap out for<br/>
&gt; any rarely used or situational song i may need, e.g. charimsatic carillion.<br/>
&gt; as far as #8 Appaling Screech, i really need to rethink this.  i am never in<br/>
&gt; an area anymore where this song will not be resisted by everything i sing it<br/>
&gt; on.  it used to be such a handy song, but with the fear cap i need something<br/>
&gt; else here, any suggestions?<br/>
