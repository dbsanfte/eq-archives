&gt; Doh! I relized that right after I sent it, LOL.  But the basement is still a <br/>
&gt; good spot as I never had to wait more then 30 mins to get into a group that <br/>
&gt; would last for the rest of the night.  It is a great place for casual <br/>
&gt; grouping, and it is nearly impossible to die there :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny how different it is on different servers. I never saw much good<br/>
casual grouping happen on Tarrew Marr for the Unrest basement, but Cazic<br/>
was always great for it. I guess it also depends when you play. When I<br/>
wasn&#39;t working I&#39;d log in in the day time and usually there&#39;d only be 4<br/>
or 5 people in Cazic so it made sense to group. Was also fun because we<br/>
ended up with some very weird combo groups then, composed of whoever<br/>
happened to be there. That made it fun for me because I could try<br/>
different song combos to see what was more effective for these weird<br/>
class groupings.<br/>
