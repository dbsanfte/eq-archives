<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062512601">I&#39;m not attributing my lag or LD problems last night to the patch.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
attempt to trace where my packets were going awry.  I would really assume<br/>
something between myself, Verant, and quite a few other people was the<br/>
problem since there were numerous people in Lake of Ill Omen (only zone I<br/>
was in last night) who were also having problems.  There are way too many<br/>
variables to point the figure directly at Verant, and I doubt they had any<br/>
control over the problems I saw last night.  <br/>
 <br/>
The other problems Kit brought up, I definitely can&#39;t say anything about as<br/>
I haven&#39;t experienced them.  That being said, DirectX is a very touchy beast<br/>
at times, especially with regards to Direct3D and video drivers.  The<br/>
recommendations of reinstalling DirectX and ensuring you have the latest<br/>
video drivers is almost always a valid troubleshooting suggestion; however,<br/>
if this has already been tried, and there are no new drivers, then something<br/>
else needs to be looked at.<br/>

I&#39;m sure they WOULD fix the problems, if they knew how.<br/>
It is not as easy to fix problems as to say &quot;Fix them&quot;<br/>
You first have to figure out what the problems are.<br/>
<br/>
ALL of the disconnects I have had recently I can trail right back<br/>
to my DSL line. Including last night&#39;s. (We have REALLY poor DSL service.<br/>
But<br/>
US West can&#39;t seem to figure out why our line quality goes so screwy<br/>
so often) I do not have the problem of mobs turning into male humans, and<br/>
have never heard of the boat doing so before.<br/>
<br/>
These aren&#39;t problems affecting every subscriber or, even, a majority.<br/>
And at that point, it does become much more likely there is a problem<br/>
on the individual&#39;s system than in the program itself.</div>
