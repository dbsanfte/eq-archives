<div id="ygrps-yiv-708341567">Do normal bard melee attacks even interrupt a caster?  I was always under the<br/>
impression that the only melee attack that would interrupt spellcasting was a<br/>
bash/slam.  For several levels now I have dual wielded thulian claws (DLY 19)<br/>
and a dragoon dirk (23 DLY).  I have never noticed any of my attacks<br/>
interrupting a spell. Granted when a caster is interrupted its hard to tell what<br/>
did it.  Was it my pixie strike, the paladins bash, or one of our own casters<br/>
hitting it with a Stun effect spell.  I thought the only way bards could<br/>
interrupt spellcasting was with songs like Bellow, Lullaby and Pixie Strike.<br/>
