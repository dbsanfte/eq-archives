&gt;Actually I play a cleric and a bard as well.  Several of the bard/rogue<br/>
&gt;items are or already have been realigned to be rogue only due to rogue<br/>
&gt;complaints.  And yes the primarily found Cleric weapon is Cleric/Paladin<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;there are many special weapons easily obtainable for clerics like the<br/>
&gt;Bloodforge hammer.<br/>
&gt;High elves and halflings are the low for cleric hitpoints, half-elves and<br/>
&gt;humans are the high for bard hitpoints.  Our dwarf cleric has near 400hp to<br/>
&gt;my 337 and he is 2 levels below me with no points added to stamina and no<br/>
&gt;boosting items (just like me).  His AC is also 30 points higher since his<br/>
&gt;strength is 100+ with minimal point investment.  Maybe clerics in general<br/>
&gt;only make slightly better or equal tanks to us, but dwarf clerics<br/>
 </span></blockquote>definitely<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;make better tanks than any bard.<br/>
&gt;Bards do get dual wield at 17th level.  The increased damage in minimal in<br/>
&gt;most group combats as you get one extra attack occassionally instead of 20<br/>
&gt;extra AC versus all the attackers beating on you.  I doubt I will dual<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wield<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;if I am facing multiple mobs as an 8% AC increase vs multiple opponents is<br/>
&gt;better than a 10-15% increase in damage vs one opponent.  Just like our<br/>
&gt;healing song on a full group is a whopping 48 pts per pulse, with lute<br/>
&gt;seated at 16th level.  Against more than one attacker a shield quickly<br/>
&gt;becomes better for someone who dual wields, but doesnt dual wield well.<br/>
&gt;Additionally as far as I know clerics melee skill caps at 200 just like<br/>
&gt;ours, only they don&#39;t get there until 49 while we get there at 40.  At<br/>
 </span></blockquote>level<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;16 with an 85 (max) I hit only slightly more than my dwarf cleric<br/>
 </span></blockquote>compatriot<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;at 60.  Since he hits for max 95% of the time due to having a str of 135 or<br/>
&gt;so and I hit for max about 70% of the time at strength 102 (both with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>buffs)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;he does nearly as much damage as I if not more.  Even with the well known<br/>
&gt;bard hate factor, we can twist spin most mobs where I hit them they turn to<br/>
&gt;me, he hits them they turn to him etc.  That means our damage values<br/>
 </span></blockquote>overall<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;are very close.<br/>
&gt;In addition his full suit of armor cost less than 150pp.  I on the other<br/>
&gt;hand have one piece alone that cost me that much (silvered bracer).<br/>
&gt;Granted I have far more options than he does as far as play style.  In the<br/>
&gt;groups using the wizard cleric combo I talked about the mob died before<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ever<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;leaving the invulnerable cleric.  Probably not always the case, but it sure<br/>
&gt;was while I was there.  I was told my role was to heal them and speed up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;clerics attacks so he could do enough damage to stay far enough up to avoid<br/>
&gt;the mob leaving him.  Might have been unique to what we were fighting at<br/>

&gt;Since I play both a cleric and a bard, I&#39;d like to correct some of the<br/>
&gt;Cleric rumors going on around here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cleric only equipment?<br/>
&gt;The first and only Cleric-only weapon (that I have heard of) was just found<br/>
&gt;on Vox.<br/>
&gt;The only Cleric-only armor is on the Plane of Fear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a quest weapon that is Cleric and Paladin, just like many items<br/>
&gt;that are Bard and Rogue only.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to hitpoints, Bards and Clerics have about the same amount.  But if you<br/>
&gt;compare a Dwarven Cleric (95 STA) to a Wood Elf Bard (65 STA) you will<br/>
&gt;probably see a difference in favor of the Cleric.  My Half Elf Bard has<br/>
&gt;higher stamina and hitpoints than my High Elf Cleric.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Combat favors Bards.  Bards get dual wield and I believe a higher weapon<br/>
&gt;skill cap.  Clerics can do ok at melee, but are much more effective if they<br/>
&gt;are meditating during combat.  So Bards are much more effective in combat<br/>
&gt;that Clerics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Divine Aura lasts for 18 seconds, and is not perfect Invulnearbility as we<br/>
&gt;can be stunned quite easily.  I consider myself very lucky if DA actually<br/>
&gt;allows me to get to the zone before dying.  It has a 10-15 minute recycle<br/>
&gt;time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Divine Aura is more useful when used in combat.  But it doesn&#39;t work like<br/>
&gt;some of you think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Imagine the following, 4 wizards, 1 cleric.  Cleric casts smite,<br/>
&gt;&gt; then divine aura and gives the wizards 18 seconds of nuking.  In same<br/>
&gt;&gt; situation the bard would take a hell of a lot of damage trying to solo<br/>
&gt;tank<br/>
&gt;&gt; the same critter the cleric could.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As soon as the Wizards start nuking, the mobs will switch from the Cleric<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the Wizards.  Now the Cleric con only watch the Wizards die, as he can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;attack or cast any spells (including HEAL) until the 18 seconds wear off.<br/>
&gt;It really sucks watching a party member die because you are not allowed to<br/>
&gt;heal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The best way is to use DA on a pull when the puller is taking heavy damage.<br/>
&gt;Heal a couple of times when the puller shows up, and draw all the mobs to<br/>
&gt;you.  Then use DA to give everyone 18 seconds to pull them off you.  This<br/>
&gt;works ok, but in many pickup groups this would get me killed as the group<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t understand what I was doing.  The DA would wear off and I&#39;d still<br/>
&gt;have 4 mobs on me, while all the tanks are all focusing on a single mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is much better to have an Enchanter or Bard in the group that can do<br/>
&gt;crowd control for you.<br/>
