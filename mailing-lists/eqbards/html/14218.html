<div id="ygrps-yiv-450536867">LOL!  Ok, ok yeah I thought it was funny too!  But seriously, what&#39;s the<br/>
point of being a &#39;good&#39; Inky on a regular server?  Its much more challenging<br/>
being a &#39;renegade&#39; dark elf on a server where the players actually notice if<br/>
I were to get attacked by a guard.  Having Illusion and actually having to<br/>
worry if anyone finds out is pretty fun.  Its really good when others are<br/>
sure you must not really be a dark elf when you are kos to Dvinn.  That<br/>
usually convinces them.  Believe me you always have Gate memmed on PvP<br/>
anyhow, this just means I might have to use it more when those prejudiced<br/>
players refuse to understand I&#39;m a reformed dark elf!<br/>

PS  No I suck with melee weapons as much as any enchanter!  Especially on a<br/>
server where the magic items haven&#39;t filtered down anywhere near as much!<br/>

Am I reading this right?  You have a dark elf enchanter on a PvP teams<br/>
server that is &#39;renegade&#39;???  What next?  Let me guess, your enchanter does<br/>
not use magic but fites with melee weapons only?  What&#39;s the point?<br/>
