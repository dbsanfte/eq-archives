<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586052934">I haven&#39;t tested the spell shield of Niv&#39;s thoroughly yet, but<br/>
it seems to be about 10 points absorbed while sung, 20 with a<br/>
lute.  At 49, healing from this song is 7 points/tick sung, 14<br/>
points/tick with a lute (+1 natural regen).  I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
those numbers are accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the problem.  When the spell damage exceeds the<br/>
shield&#39;s absorption (which is 99.99% of the time at this<br/>
level), you lose the effect.  On average, this happens after<br/>
the first tick but before the second tick.  So sung, the<br/>
shield absorbs 10 points, but you lose 7 points of<br/>
healing.  Net effect is equivalent to the shield only<br/>
absorbing 3 points.  With a lute, the shield absorbs 20<br/>
points, but you lose 14 points of healing.  Net effect is<br/>
equivalent to the shield only absorbing 6 points.<br/>
<br/>
Compare to straight Hymn.  Hymn at 49 heals 9/tick sung,<br/>
18/tick with a lute (+1 natural regen).  Sung, Hymn would heal<br/>
18 points over 2 ticks while Niv&#39;s would heal 7 points and<br/>
absorb 10 points (total 17).  With a lute, Hymn would heal 36<br/>
points over 2 ticks while Niv&#39;s would heal 14 points and<br/>
absorb 20 (total 34).<br/>
<br/>
In both cases, you are better off just playing Hymn and taking<br/>
full damage from the spell, instead of relying on Niv&#39;s spell<br/>
shield.  Niv&#39;s is thus marginalized as a song only to be used<br/>
if you&#39;re already playing Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
The spell shield on this song should be improved to make it a<br/>
*better* alternative to Hymn if you&#39;re fighting a caster.  <br/>
Otherwise why even bother having the spell shield component.<br/>
