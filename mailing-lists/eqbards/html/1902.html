<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559755311">I agree with Jythri entirely (hello Pencerdd!).  Before I began to perform <br/>
my songs in Norrath, the idea of having to type /em sings &#39;la-de-da.&#39; for <br/>
every single verse seemed awful.  The macros appeared to be a saviour, but <br/>
they have never worked very well and there aren&#39;t enough to record an entire <br/>
song anyway, let alone an entire set.  When I actually took to the stage, <br/>
however, I began to appreciate the skill involved in singing each song <br/>
&#39;live&#39;.  Because nothing is scripted, you can add much more character to <br/>
your performance and even respond to the taunts of the inevitable hecklers.  <br/>
The biggest benefit, though, is the buzz you get from singing an entire song <br/>
without missing any lines, without fluffing your words and without jumping <br/>
up and down on the stage because you pressed SPACE at the wrong time!  After <br/>
my first performance, I really felt as if I&#39;d achieved something that few <br/>
others had attempted.  I AM a fast typist, so I can&#39;t deny that I have an <br/>
advantage over others who aren&#39;t, but if you treat your gradually improving <br/>
typing speed as another facet of the experience ladders built into the game, <br/>
then it simply adds an extra dimension that parallels your increasing HP&#39;s.  <br/>
Before I actually tried singing live, I would have happily joined the calls <br/>
for a scripting command.  However, I now know that the typing effort <br/>
involved in live performance is well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of scripting, even with pauses and emotes, removes all the skill <br/>
involved in performing your work, leaving the skill of composition behind.  <br/>
Composition itself is a great skill of course, but being a wonderful <br/>
lyricist shouldn&#39;t automatically mean you are a great performer as well.  <br/>
The reverse applies too; you may be able to type 100wpm and enthrall the <br/>
audience with your ad-libbing and charisma, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can <br/>
write a song that has rhyme, rhythm and emotion.  The fast but lyrically <br/>
inept typists shouldn&#39;t be calling for Verant to create an automatic song <br/>
generator, they should be looking for good writers who can&#39;t perform very <br/>
well (Elton John and Bernie Taupin come to mind here).<br/>
<br/>
As for performing longer works, we may just have to accept that they aren&#39;t <br/>
viable within a game that people are paying to play.  Even with the large <br/>
Soerbaird concerts, there are very few players who stay for the entire <br/>
performance.  The audience will shrink and grow over time, most people <br/>
listening to one or two songs before moving on.  For someone to sit and <br/>
listen to a very long ballad or story, even if it is scripted and is coming <br/>
to them at normal reading speed (which varies from person to person of <br/>
course), the story would have to be VERY well done.  Much better to be able <br/>
to sell people a book, which they can read whenever they are sitting to heal <br/>
or regain manna.  As such, I believe there IS a place for recording longer <br/>
texts within Norrath.  The ability to create books, pamphlets and scrolls <br/>
(perhaps as a trade skill), which can then be sold on to others seems like a <br/>
very worthy addition.<br/>
<br/>
As the author of one of the plays Jythri mentioned, I&#39;m convinced that it <br/>
can be done successfully.  The secret is to keep the speeches short and <br/>
packed with meaning, and to give good stage and emote directions within the <br/>
text.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I haven&#39;t been too inflamatory (or too verbose for that matter).  I <br/>
don&#39;t wish to begin an argument, just explain why I think having scripts <br/>
would remove one of the fun elements of the game.  I don&#39;t think bards like <br/>
Jythri would have become as famous as they are if their skill involved <br/>
nothing more than typing in all their songs and then clicking on a few <br/>
buttons whenever they perform them.  When people in an audience realise that <br/>
- somewhere in the world - there is a bod sitting at a keyboard, typing away <br/>
for all their worth and making no mistakes, they begin to appreciate the <br/>
amount of effort and skill that they are witnessing.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello again!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is one of my pet issues, so I&#39;m going to discuss this a bit more. <br/>
&gt;*grins*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mostly OOC here too, so my apologies...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I know that EQ is different from the text-based muds we all want to<br/>
&gt; &gt;emulate, and I&#39;m incredibly excited about the visual aspect to gaming - <br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt; &gt;until voice-com becomes standard (*grin* one, maybe two years?), typing <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt;a significant hassle.  I personally have a repetoire of nearly a hundred<br/>
&gt; &gt;songs - but typing just a set (4-6 songs) would leave my hands so cramped <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;couldn&#39;t type for a week after that.  Call me selfish - but I&#39;d like a<br/>
&gt; &gt;shortcut :P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
