&gt; All this stuff about &#39;class balance&#39; and whether an item is &#39;bugged&#39; (guise<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  The consequences of implementing such opinions however<br/>
are quite real.  Once you reach that state (of having to make<br/>
a decision based on opinion), it becomes imperative to<br/>
determine which opinion is more correct (assuming you want to<br/>
make the best decision).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You open a pandora&#39;s box if you believe in that argument.  <br/>
It&#39;s equivalent to saying the game is free of bugs.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;out&quot; you gave yourself (&quot;real chats&quot;) is nebulous at<br/>
best, and could just as easily encompass being able to use an<br/>
item your class is not supposed to be able to use.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the point I was discrediting.  Do you remember my<br/>
credit card surcharge post - how the same thing presented<br/>
differently can have different effects all because of<br/>
perception?  To *not* make it &#39;illegal&#39; after the fact can be<br/>
perceived as hurting players who don&#39;t have them yet (and now<br/>
never will).  You are falling into the oversimplified thinking<br/>
I was trying to discredit - that because it doesn&#39;t an<br/>
absolute negative effect, it&#39;s ok.  The relative negative<br/>
effect is just as important - how would you feel if I were<br/>
somehow able to wave a wand and make it so you never have a<br/>
greater salary for the rest of your life than what you make<br/>
now?<br/>

&gt; its fair to change stuff because they think it &quot;should be.&quot; It&#39;s like their<br/>
&gt; nerfing of Selo&#39;s and breaking roots - they gave you something and it was<br/>
&gt; good - but now they think its too good and nerf it. Now it&#39;s getting down to<br/>
&gt; a matter of opinion on what is good, too good, or &#39;obvious bug.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not disputing that the issue is murky at best.  All I was<br/>
disputing was that the issue is nowhere near as clear cut as<br/>
your line of thinking would make it.<br/>
