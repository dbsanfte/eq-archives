<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335156000">I have always heard (my bro is a ranger and follows the ranger board<br/>
closely) that you want your fastest weapon in your primary to be able to get<br/>
your damage bonus as often as possible and that in your secondary slow ratio<br/>
is what you want to follow (as your secondary does not get damage bonus).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m using a 6/19 in primary (Sainy&#39;s claw) and a 13/26 (Flameweaver) in<br/>
secondary.<br/>

&gt; Life in here again.  :)  Hi all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you determine what weapon to put in what hand, for best results?  I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t seen this come up in a looong time, and until recently, it has<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; a no brainer for me.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, for a while, I had an 8/24 and a 6/19, and I assumed the 8/24 was<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; in the primary hand, but someone said it might be better to have the 6/19<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; primary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, now I have an 11/23 and a 12/26.  Initially, I&#39;d put the 11/23 in<br/>
&gt; primary, since it&#39;s faster, but..well, I just don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Atonal the slow<br/>
&gt; Would you believe 45!  :)<br/>
