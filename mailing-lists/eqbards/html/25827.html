We have one of the best bards I&#39;ve ever seen in our guild... well all our<br/>
bards rock... but we have a &quot;sploiter&quot; Bard... and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever<br/>
seen him do 5 songs.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your friend had two bards in the group and didnt realize it :)<br/>

OK,<br/>
<br/>
Sitting around with some RL friends who play everquest, and suddenly one of <br/>
them says &quot;by the way, your bard sucks now.&quot;  &quot;Eh?&quot; I say.  &quot;Yeah, we <br/>
played with a bard the other night, 58, who kept 4 songs going most of the <br/>
fight and said when things get tough he twists in a fifth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is this BS?  Or do i really suck.  When I have a good connection and low <br/>
lag I keep four going with few drops...<br/>
<br/>
I have one song per hotkey, and I hit 1122334411223344...<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something here?  Should I set up hotkeys so that one casts two <br/>
songs with appropriate delays?  I&#39;ve never like that idea because it gives <br/>
me less flexibility... but now I begin to wonder.<br/>
<br/>
Or is this bs...<br/>
<br/>
Very curious to hear what y&#39;all have to say<br/>
