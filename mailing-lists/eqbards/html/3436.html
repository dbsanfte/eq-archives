I just hit Level 6 last night (very happy to get the <br/>
Heal song :) Anyway I have been keeping up a number of <br/>
weapon skills. Since level 3 I have kept 1 hand slash, <br/>
1 hand Blunt and Piercing all maxed. I have tried to <br/>
keep Hand to Hand maxed as well but it seems to raise <br/>
a few points each level and then stop. Does this skill <br/>
cap lower per level than the other weapon skills? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Yes, I am pretty sure it is something like 3x per <br/>
 </span></blockquote>level and there is a cap around 40 or so.  Others can <br/>
confirm this as I can&#39;t find the old message.  I wish <br/>
I had kept my H to H up, at level 17 it&#39;s pretty <br/>
dangerous using it a low level.  As you  get higher it <br/>
gets harder to max out your weapon skills. you might <br/>
want to pick two to concentrate on. (any else agree - <br/>
disagree?)<br/>
     <br/>
Second question is about being interupted while <br/>
playing. My only other character is a Rogue so forgive <br/>
me if my magic user references are wrong, don&#39;t know <br/>
much about them :)  When I got my heal song I took off <br/>
after a skeleton that conned white to me. I was <br/>
interupted alot. This had not really happened before at <br/>
least not this much! Is Intstrument/Singing skill what <br/>
helps prevents Bards being interupted like Channeling <br/>
is to Magic user casting? If not what is? BTW I beat <br/>
the skeleton but was not pretty *grins*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s the bash attack that Skellies have.  They are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one of the first monsters that have bash that you run <br/>
into (like the warrior skill bash) and you should just <br/>
get used to it.  It interrupts your song.  Nothing you <br/>
can do about it.  <br/>
     <br/>
Third (almost done :) on getting a new song about how <br/>
long is it level wise or skill wise before you can <br/>
count on playing that song well? Is there such a time? <br/>
Another thing that surprised me was that I mess up <br/>
playing that Heal song alot more than any of the other <br/>
songs I have.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As you go up in level the songs get easier to sing. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>So the most recently acquired song is always the <br/>
hardest to start but gets easier as you level, ect., <br/>
repeat.<br/>
     <br/>
Lastly I noticed when I bought my Drums at level 5 <br/>
from the wood elf vendor she sold a Mandolin and Lute <br/>
as well. Is there a difference in these two for <br/>
playing purposes? Or are they just two options for <br/>
string instruments?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The effect seems to be identical (anyone?) but the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mandolin weighs a lot less so buy it if you can <br/>
afford it since weight becomes critical when you <br/>
start getting heavy armor. (BTW, you want banded <br/>
armor next and it&#39;s getting dirt cheap what with <br/>
everyone going to plate and a surplus of smiths.)<br/>
     <br/>
Many thanks for the help and safe travels.<br/>
