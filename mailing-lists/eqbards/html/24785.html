<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-450440724">Nothing was charmed - was always hostile and hitting hard.  There was no<br/>
message of mez wearing off - it just wouldn&#39;t stick for a while - and then<br/>
the mob was down some hit points when I finally WAS able to mez it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the AOE theory makes the most sense.  Perhaps I was able to mez it<br/>
after it burned through its mana..<br/>

&quot;The only conclusion I could make was that they DOT themselves.  Again -<br/>
Channelers can cast any spell that any player in the group has memmed - you<br/>
often see them CH...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh? I don&#39;t know about this.  I have hunted here quite a bit (100 hours?).<br/>
And I have never seen these guys charm.  = P.  I have charm mem&#39;d here a<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a mob smart enough to DoT himself.<br/>
