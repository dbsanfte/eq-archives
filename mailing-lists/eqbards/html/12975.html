<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835840494">Hello All,<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to try to get a couple more items for my bard<br/>
armor quest and am thinking of heading to MM. I have never been there<br/>
before,mainly because most of my friends/ guild members have been in the<br/>
usual places-Guk,CZ,Unrest,etc.<br/>
At this point I would probably be going there myself-a pickup group scares<br/>
me in this place from what I&#39;ve heard-so my questions are:<br/>
What are my chances of asking for loot rights to the gypsy lute and black<br/>
silk gloves-and how easy or hard is it to get to them?<br/>
What are my chances at level 35 of getting in group to hunt them?<br/>
And what songs should I be using there?<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help :)<br/>
