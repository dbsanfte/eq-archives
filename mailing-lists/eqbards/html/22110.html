&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just wanted to share my excitement with the folks on this list I have <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt;a part of for over a year, I went on my first Plane raid last night on E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;and it was a blast.  The were only 2 bards on the raid of 47 people<br/>
&gt;including me and the other bard, Strattos, had most of his imbrued already.<br/>
&gt;Strattos was very cool and gave me lots of pointers when I got up there, <br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;sure if you are on this list Strattos but if so, thanks for all your help!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was a great night, both Maestro and Inny were up and Maestro was dual<br/>
&gt;wielding 6-note blades.  We failed in our first attempt on Maestro but we<br/>
&gt;reorganized and took him down with few deaths on try number 2.   The battle<br/>
&gt;against Innoruk went faster than Maestro with few deaths and we took him<br/>
&gt;down on the first try.  I ended up getting a Six Note Blade and Imbrued <br/>
&gt;legs<br/>
&gt;with only one death but was not in a group that was getting any XP,<br/>
&gt;nonetheless it was great fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The thing that I thought was the coolest was that 8 individual groups of<br/>
&gt;people went up there and worked together without bickering over items and<br/>
&gt;XP, I&#39;ve been playing EQ for over a year and a half and this is truly a<br/>
&gt;right of passage for me.  Thanks to everyone on this list for all the great<br/>
&gt;advice over the months that has helped me to be the best bard I can be<br/>
&gt;within the limitations of Verant&#39;s world.<br/>
