<div id="ygrps-yiv-58823822">Also, all the situations you are describing entail breaking up an initial<br/>
spawn in which case I strongly advocate an enchanter.  All the situations<br/>
I&#39;m referering to are after the spawn is broken in which case an enchanters<br/>
role should change in my opinion.<br/>

&gt; There are many times when you are going to have to fight multiple mobs.<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; not because a &quot;pull&quot; is screwed up but because it is the way things are<br/>
&gt; going to pull.  In this case, crowd control falls to the class that is<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; able to deal with it: enchanter(s).  When my guild goes on a raid to a<br/>
&gt; serious place (fire giants, ice giants, dragons, planes) we have 2<br/>
&gt; enchanters.  I can&#39;t tell you exactly which mez spell they use on which<br/>
mob,<br/>
&gt; many times they charm (can&#39;t mez giants?) but whatever they do, one of<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; best specialties is crowd control.  In some situations, other guilds use<br/>
&gt; other tactics (2 clerics per tank group & level 50 tanks) and just beat<br/>
down<br/>
&gt; what they can and res back until they have cleared what they want.  We<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; our enchanters to do crowd control (we like Clarity & Swift Like The Wind<br/>
&gt; too ;p)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For some fun we decided to jump into the pit under Vox&#39;s Lair and clear<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; the giant polar bears, wooly spider, & dire wolves.  If you fall down the<br/>
&gt; first pitfall, you land in a room with 5 or 6 giant polar bears (blue to<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; at 48).  They are positioned such that if you pull one you will get<br/>
several.<br/>
&gt; We had 3 groups, 2 enchanters and no problems dealing with them.  Too bad<br/>
&gt; Verant forgot to itemize them with any loot.  It was fun jumping into some<br/>
&gt; place that you usually try so hard to avoid and then cleaning house.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But in other situations, you are going to face multi-mob pulls.  Plane of<br/>
&gt; Hate getting a couple Clerics, Scron Banshee and Forsaken Rev in one pull<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; fairly normal and with enchanters&#39; crowd control, your teams can deal with<br/>
&gt; it.  We go for everyone kill the same mob and fite them one at a time.  We<br/>
&gt; have designated taunters in the event a pet or something breaks and gets<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; a cleric or enchanter but the main group assists the primary and secondary<br/>
&gt; target pickers.  (Make hotkeys that say &quot;/assist name1&quot;  and &quot;/assist<br/>
name2&quot;<br/>
&gt; rather than just &quot;/assist&quot;).  Even so, we see that the assist command is<br/>
&gt; buggy and sometimes you cant get a target or get a bad target but the<br/>
intent<br/>
&gt; is to focus on one mob at a time.  It something that we have worked out<br/>
&gt; given how we load groups (one cleric per tank group).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the biggest value of having a SOP (Standard Operating Plan) is<br/>
&gt; maintaining a coordinated effort.  If everyone has a job and sticks to it,<br/>
&gt; you eliminate the confusion that can rapidly escalate into disaster when<br/>
&gt; somebody gets creative and &#39;trys something&#39;.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Admitted, but the point was an Enchanter who is mezzing is doing so<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; the party screwed up in the first place IMHO...<br/>
&gt; &gt; :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; ACK! Even without Mez, Enchanters still have SO many better ways<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; using their mana than nuking. Stunning! Tashan (Debuffing magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resistance)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Other debuffs. -- Enemy slowdown! Attacker speeduP!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nuking should only be done VERY occasionally by enchanters. OUr<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mana to damage ratio is terrible.<br/>
