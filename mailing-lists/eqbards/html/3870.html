<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396349676">All the /con does is tell you the monster&#39;s level in relation to your own, nothing<br/>
more. Is a 16th level wizard considerably more dangerous than a 15th, because of<br/>
his new spells? YES! And yet if you are 17th, one cons high blue and the other a<br/>
low blue.<br/>
<br/>
The range that cons cover and there messages change as you level to cover broader<br/>
ranges. At Level 4 for example, black/white is the same level as you, blue is L3<br/>
(one level lower), yellow is L5 (one level higher), and red is 2+ levels higher<br/>
(L6+). In the mid teens the con messages change, so that blue is within two levels<br/>
below you, and yellow two higher. In the mid 20s, the messages gain further range,<br/>
yellow is still 2 higher, but blue can be up to 6(?) levels lower. When I<br/>
determine whether I want to risk soloing, I very rarely fight anything blue unless<br/>
I know the monster well. I stick to the high green con message.<br/>
<br/>
To reiterate, the con message is only an indication of your target&#39;s level with<br/>
respect to your own, and nothing more. Just remember that because of special<br/>
skills and spell circles different races are stronger at certain levels then<br/>
others, particularly when it comes to casters.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and named NPCs are always harder than their con. DVinn, Dorn, and the SK in<br/>
west commons (Garrick Dix or something) are all examples that come to mind.<br/>

&gt; In fact the /con system is somewhat deceptive and dangerous.  Verant&#39;s<br/>
&gt; assignment of levels and abilities versus effectiveness appears seriously<br/>
&gt; inconsistent.<br/>
