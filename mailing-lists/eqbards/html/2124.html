&gt;That&#39;s one of the real subtle benefits of the Bard class.  Each and every<br/>
&gt;one of your songs grows more potent as you level, and never becomes truly<br/>
&gt;obsolete.  There&#39;s a situation to be found for using each and every one.<br/>

J.M.  Thanks as always for all your great info!!!<br/>
<br/>
But are you sure that ALL songs improve as you increase level? To be honest,<br/>
I haven&#39;t done any testing in this arena. Sure, some are obvious (i.e.<br/>
Bellow damage going up every other level or so, etc). But some songs, like<br/>
the Healing song, seem to remain the same. Is it a subtle change, i.e. the<br/>
Healing song heals one more point ever 5 levels? Or is it supposed to be<br/>
something you notice from level to level?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
