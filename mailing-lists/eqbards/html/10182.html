<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653600576">Welcome to the board Galeras.  Glad to see another bard from E&#39;ci.  Here&#39;s<br/>
my opinion on the questions you asked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My questions are these:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Is what I am doing wrong?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Nope.  Play the character the way you want.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Nope.  Would be nice if more people played this way but to each his<br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I am a twink?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I wouldn&#39;t worry about.  You know you aren&#39;t a twink so thats all<br/>
that matters.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this character.  And, I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   never thought twice about it until I was reading some recent posts. Will<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt;   be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Its your money, spend it how ever you want to.  <br/>
