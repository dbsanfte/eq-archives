<div id="ygrps-yiv-511258729">Looks like we&#39;re going to get nerfed again...  Here&#39;s a quote I just got off <br/>
Everlore about today&#39;s patch...  OK, granted it&#39;s not just a nerf to us, but <br/>
all the &quot;battle bards&quot; will definitely be affected by it...  Now watch as <br/>
they make it so that ONLY bards using haste songs and FBSS&#39;s will fight <br/>
SLOWER...<br/>
<br/>

In any case, I doubt that it will be as valuable after tomorrow. We found a <br/>
bug with the way &quot;haste&quot; items stack with &quot;haste&quot; spells. Basically, even <br/>
the worst haste item combined with the worst haste spell would put the <br/>
wearer at the haste cap. This basically invalidated the better haste items <br/>
and spells, and explains why people have been saying that the newer haste <br/>
items aren&#39;t any better than the FBSS.<br/>
<br/>
This is being fixed in tomorrow&#39;s patch.<br/>
