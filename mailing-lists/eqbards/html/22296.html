<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397481624">the reason i got rid of all my lambent and SS was precisely this.  twinks<br/>
trying to be me!!<br/>
<br/>
ok, so what i wear is Imbrued gaunts, bracers, and vambraces...  (so gold or<br/>
whatever from shoulder to finger... nicely uniformed appearance =)<br/>
<br/>
then i have steel bp and greaves.  so, to keep the steel look everywhere<br/>
else, i have watchmans boots, and a skull shaped barbute... (normally wear<br/>
froggy crown for the no graphic cuz i&#39;m so cute =P<br/>
<br/>
steel from neck to toe, and fully golden arms... not a half bad look. not<br/>
many twinks aim for that, so it distinguishes me from them at least...<br/>
<br/>
but when i want to look like a dragoon, i put on my shin gaunts, vox bracer<br/>
and SSB, equip my martune rapier and RBF in my melee slots, and use my &quot;You<br/>
are no match for a dragoon!&quot; hotkey, and walk around Crushbone or WCommons<br/>
terrorizing newbies =)<br/>
<br/>
what fun the bard is!<br/>

p.s. when impersonating an NPC, i use the sneak skill too, to authenticate<br/>
it more  ;-)</div>
