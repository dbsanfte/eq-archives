<b>Subject:</b> Re: Bards and dragon loots WAS RE: Vox Dead on Tarew Marr <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-708368464">I think if a class is able to use an item they should be included in the <br/>
random loot - PERIOD. Especially on a damn dragon raid where bards are very <br/>
likely to die and lose xp (I died 3 times on my last dragon raid and got <br/>
nothing out of it but lost xp - even with 49th level resses, but I had fun <br/>
which is what counts most). There are certain items that are caster/bard <br/>
(like the orb thing dropped by Magi Rokyl) that I would gladly pass on <br/>
randoming, but a haste belt? HAHA count me in. I have done my fair share of <br/>
camping stuff for friends helping others get things - which I am glad to do. <br/>
It makes me feel good to know that my favorite tank has gotten the best <br/>
equipment available. But if I am going to be risking my ass losing my 50th <br/>
level xp buffer I better damn well be considered for Bard-useable loot that <br/>
I may be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Example - I finally got my FBSS at lvl 49 after COUNTLESS hours and hours of <br/>
helping many of my friends get theirs, and purposefully making myself last <br/>
in loot order over the tanks and rogues who could make better use of it. I <br/>
finally got sick of camping frenzy (blah, I&#39;m just sick of Lower Guk in <br/>
general - I&#39;d be glad to never step foot in that hole again) and as we <br/>
camped frenzy each time I was included in the random loot roll. A monk <br/>
friend of mine who needed the sash was there with me and we rolled for it <br/>
when it finally dropped. He got a 93 out of 0 - 100. I rolled a 99. He <br/>
cried, i felt sorry for him. If I had not spent so much time camping that <br/>
bitch I would&#39;ve been glad to let him have it, but I have had my fill. I <br/>
will of course continue to help him camp the bastard because I feel I owe <br/>
him that much.<br/>
<br/>
The sash has greatly increased my melee potential. Especially while soloing <br/>
when I can&#39;t find a group (imagine that). It does make a difference for <br/>
bards - I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass what any other melee type says.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are a HUGE asset on dragon raids. I think it&#39;s VERY important to <br/>
establish looting guidelines before you even pass the dimplomat&#39;s doors in <br/>
perma or kill the Tranix in sol B. I for one would tell them to find another <br/>
bard that doesn&#39;t mind not being included in random loot rolls. I don&#39;t know <br/>
about your server, but on mine they would be very hard pressed to find <br/>
someone like that unless they are already maxed out on equipment.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a vein in my<br/>
&gt;forehead.<br/>
&gt;It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed Bolster Belt.<br/>
&gt;This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste effect. The<br/>
&gt;question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>
&gt;abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>
&gt;had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>
&gt;(Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>
&gt;would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>
&gt;a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>
