<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233303393">On a similar note to this, I normally play the game in the office, because<br/>
my machine at home is a bit hopelessly slow. When I last tried to play the<br/>
game at home P200 with a modem (not helped by the fact that I&#39;m in England),<br/>
I managed to &quot;outrun&quot; _my own_ Accelerando. I&#39;d be constantly playing<br/>
accelerando with a drum, but quite often I&#39;d get the slow down message. I&#39;m<br/>
thinking that the Accelerando effect plants itself where you are playing it<br/>
every tick, and has a big enough range that you can&#39;t normally outrun it. It<br/>
was a bit freaky to actually outrun my own song even though all the song<br/>
effects were still going (I actually lost the icon and everything until the<br/>
next pulse).<br/>
