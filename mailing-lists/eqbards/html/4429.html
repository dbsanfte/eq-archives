<div id="ygrps-yiv-580143730">We should compile a guide containing all of our knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, now that I think about it, it&#39;s not exactly a &quot;bard&quot; thing<br/>
to do -- I think historically, bards pass knowledge through songs and<br/>
stories, not by writing them down.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  Out of Character, here&#39;s a guide.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Twist your spells.  Almost all the spell songs have a 4 to 6<br/>
second duration.  It takes about 3 seconds to switch from one song to<br/>
another (I&#39;m at level 11).  So you should be able to keep 2 songs<br/>
continously up, or 3 songs where you manage to replace the 1st song<br/>
right before it fades away.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Set up your hotkeys efficiently.  You can pull inventory and<br/>
weapon slots onto hotkey positions; that will allow you to change<br/>
weapons and instruments without having to go to the inventory screen.<br/>
 I have three hotkey banks at level 11, described below:<br/>
<br/>
Bank 3:<br/>
Heal_Hymn  Discord<br/>
Whistling   _SIT_<br/>
Bat. Chant  Selo&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
Bank 5:                 Bank 6:<br/>
Heal_Hymn  Lullaby      Weapon1  Weapon2<br/>
Whistling  /assist      Invent5  Invent6<br/>
Anthem      Selo&#39;s      INCOMING  Selo&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve remapped my keyboard such that the player defined keys are  the<br/>
QWASZX keys, and with the banks set up as they are, I have a really<br/>
easy time switching around.  I usually keep myself on bank 6,<br/>
swapping the drum and my weapon as needed.  Entering combat, if I&#39;m<br/>
solo, I do shift-A, A and get whistle started.  If I&#39;m in a group,<br/>
it&#39;s Shift-Z, Z and Anthem is started.  If I need to run, the button<br/>
is always X for Selo&#39;s, and then shift-X to make sure I get the drum<br/>
equipped.  If I ever use more than just 1 weapon and 2 instruments,<br/>
I&#39;ll probably use Bank 4; otherwise, Bank 6 is customized for<br/>
Fetching duties.  You&#39;ll also notice that I have the two stringed<br/>
songs on top (QW).  My current favorite pastime is running around a<br/>
scarab or spider alternating between heal and discord.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Magic gloves will not give you the ability to punch with magic. <br/>
It seems only monks have that ability.  So stick to magic weapons, or<br/>
your songs.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Maximize your weapon skills.  1H Slash is great for the beginning<br/>
levels, but the best bard weapons are in Piercing.  I use 1H Blunt in<br/>
trying out the theory that you can get better pelts if you don&#39;t hack<br/>
the animal up -- haven&#39;t proven it yet.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Trust us bards:  Faster Weapons are Better.  Statistically, if<br/>
you weigh the damage with a probability to hit, you would want more<br/>
chances to hit.  Besides, heavy weapons are a drain on stamina, and<br/>
with the bard&#39;s various combat speed songs, faster weapons definitely<br/>
outdo the heavier weapons.  The best weapon for its current<br/>
availability is the Dragoon Dirk from Ambassador Dvinn in Crushbone.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Charm (and Lull?) spells will clear the monster&#39;s most-wanted<br/>
list.  In some cases, it also clears the damage list.  Clearing the<br/>
most-wanted list means the monster will act indifferent again. <br/>
Clearing the damage list means that if someone was trying to<br/>
killsteal, they just wasted their mana (heh heh).<br/>
<br/>
7.  Travel light.  There&#39;s a theory that getting anywhere near<br/>
encumberance levels detracts from our fighting skills.  I&#39;m currently<br/>
only wearing cloth armor; while I am currently having difficulty with<br/>
blue monsters, I survive pretty well (Chant does wonders for AC, eh?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh ... other ideas:<br/>
<br/>
You can give items to NPCs by left clicking the item onto them.  The<br/>
item becomes part of their inventory (so, if you find a short beer<br/>
and spices in a wolf, that&#39;s from me.  You&#39;re welcome.)  If you give<br/>
a weapon to a humanoid NPC, they will usually equip that weapon. <br/>
This has been reported to have been done to guards with orc picks, as<br/>
well as orc centurions / legionnaires with orc picks.  Someday, I&#39;ll<br/>
walk up to a sand giant and teach him the beauty of orc picks.<br/>
<br/>
You can kite by alternating Selo&#39;s and Bellow.  If you don&#39;t have<br/>
that, your next best option is Selo&#39;s and Hymn (run away, heal up<br/>
fast, turn back and fight).  If you&#39;re in a safe area and know how to<br/>
run around monsters, you can swap Selo&#39;s and Dissonance. <br/>
<br/>
Anthem and Chant will not stack.  So Chant when solo, and Anthem<br/>
(group +10% battle speed) when in a group.  Always use Whistle (+20%<br/>
battle speed) if you&#39;re tanking.  Whistle and Anthem will give you<br/>
25% battle speed.<br/>
<br/>
In game time, Jig does not improve mana regen.  However, it seems to<br/>
improve screen refresh rates (?huh??)  so perceptually, it looks like<br/>
mana is regen faster.<br/>
<br/>
Hymn will even out with (asp/darkweed) poison damage.  Hymn with an<br/>
instrument will let you heal albeit slower.<br/>
<br/>
When running with Selo&#39;s in a group, try being the last one so that<br/>
no one is left behind.  If you&#39;re stuck as pointman, switch to walk<br/>
(I have agility 90, with selo and the hand drum, I seem to be walking<br/>
just as fast as anyone else is running.  Heh!)<br/>
<br/>
Jig restores stamina.  Most known use is to allow you to swim above<br/>
water for longer periods of time.  You can also use it to avoid<br/>
hunger&thirst death -- you&#39;ll still be hungry, but you are &quot;tough&quot;<br/>
enough to take it ... until you get to your corpse.<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s why I avoided getting bound in the bank.  I can run 5 zones<br/>
... maybe more ... without suffering.  Just a lot of spam, but we&#39;re<br/>
used to that anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s will accelerate you when running over ground and when swimming<br/>
underwater.<br/>
<br/>
Take up baking.  There&#39;s nothing more relaxing after getting chased<br/>
by monsters than chasing after monsters.  I spend about an hour each<br/>
game session running around with the newbies and making batwing<br/>
crunchies, edible goo, clumps of dough, rat sandwiches, and brewing<br/>
up ginesh and bog juice.  It helps fill up that time when you&#39;re<br/>
waiting for wizards to finish medding or when you&#39;re organizing a<br/>
group together.<br/>
