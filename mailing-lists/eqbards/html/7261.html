&gt; &gt; &gt; As always, over guildsay and all, Every lvl 50 or so where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there to try to take a piece of her. Not only they did no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; amage, But she was calling over the &quot;Power of Innoruuk&quot; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; insta-kill them... Not nice to see lvl 50 drop in one cast.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What&#39;s not nice is the uppity high level players trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt;ruin something that Verant is trying to do for the rest of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the players. Everyone complains about no quests and no<br/>
&gt; &gt;&#39;ongoing&#39; story lines - yet when Verant tries to add them<br/>
&gt; &gt;in there&#39;s someone that tries to ruin it - so they take<br/>
&gt; &gt;care of the problem the only way they can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; True, but creating unkillable NPC also stifles RP&#39;ing as well.  If a High <br/>
&gt; Elf Paladin or for that matter a Wood Elf Bard were to come across a being <br/>
&gt; claiming to be the Daughter of the foul god that killed the Elven King and <br/>
&gt; Queen and created the foul race of the Teir&#39;dal they would be betraying <br/>
&gt; there own heritage by not attempting to slay her.   If players are able to <br/>
&gt; slay gods on their own turf they should be able to slay a god&#39;s <br/>
&gt; avatar/messenger/etc on the mortal plain.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you recall Brian Hook&#39;s first long public post after<br/>
joining EQ, he ranted a bit about how he put together a GM<br/>
quest for level 17-25 folks in Butcherblock, and a bunch of<br/>
level 50s came and killed him.  You&#39;re correct in that for RP<br/>
purposes, the daughter of a god probably should&#39;ve been at<br/>
least level 50.  But because she was green to them, I&#39;d assume<br/>
the quest was tailored for people of lower level.  If they&#39;ve<br/>
made it so GM-run NPCs can insta-kill anyone who cons them as<br/>
green, I&#39;d have to say that&#39;s a brilliant solution to this<br/>
type of problem.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think how you behave in situations like this<br/>
really says a lot about you as a person.  If you see a GM run<br/>
quest where the GM-run NPC is green to you, do you (A) Kill<br/>
him to see what kewl lewt he has, or (B) let the people for<br/>
whom the quest was designed play it out?  For that matter, if<br/>
you&#39;re camping a mob that&#39;s way green to you for the item, and<br/>
an approriate level group comes wanting to camp it, do you<br/>
willingly yield?<br/>
<br/>
Btw, what does this have to do with bards?<br/>
