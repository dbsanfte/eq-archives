<div id="ygrps-yiv-427695888">I know this is a controversial issue, with many people<br/>
staunchly believing it doesn&#39;t make sense to play Hymn during<br/>
a fight at higher levels.  But I thought I&#39;d toss out some<br/>
numbers I happened to calculate during last night&#39;s play.<br/>
<br/>
Two paladins and I (L31, 32, 31) were wandering Guk and<br/>
happened across the ancient crocodile.  It /conned blue so we<br/>
decided to give it a shot as they both had lay hands ready.<br/>
One of them has ghoulbane and the other has a blackened iron<br/>
bastard sword, so in general I do less than half the damage<br/>
one of them can do in a fight.  Hence I&#39;d mostly been playing<br/>
with my lute singing Hymn along with Anthem and Chain.<br/>
<br/>
The croc hits hard, with a max hit of around 72 and often<br/>
double-attacking.  Buffed out, the paladins had about 1000 hp<br/>
(200 hp per bubble), I had abaout 750.  The fight lasted 27<br/>
song pulses, and ended with one paladin down to 2 bubbles, the<br/>
other down below 1 (he stepped back to heal himself near the<br/>
end), for a net deficit of 1400-1500 hp.  (They are both very<br/>
good at using taunt and stopping attacks to evenly distribute<br/>
the damage they&#39;re taking.)<br/>
<br/>
Hymn at my level with a lute heals 13 points per tick.  In 27<br/>
pulses with both paladins wounded, it healed roughly 702<br/>
points, for a total deficit of 2100-2200 hp.  That is, even in<br/>
a fight against an opponent who often double-hit for 60-70,<br/>
and with just two people wounded, Hymn with a lute was able to<br/>
&quot;reduce&quot; the damage taken during the fight by roughly 30%.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d equipped my weapons and joined in the fighting, I<br/>
would&#39;ve boosted our damage rate by about 20% (assuming I do<br/>
half the damage of either of them).  That would&#39;ve resulted in<br/>
the croc dying 20% faster, and us taking ~430 points less<br/>
damage.  Hymn without a lute heals 7 points a tick, so over 22<br/>
rounds it would&#39;ve healed 308 points.  Add these to get 738<br/>
points.<br/>
<br/>
So we probably would&#39;ve done slightly better with me using my<br/>
weapons instead of singing Hymn.  But remember that this is<br/>
with just two people wounded.  If the group had been bigger,<br/>
the benefit of using Hymn with a lute would&#39;ve been greater,<br/>
while the impact of me using my weapons would&#39;ve been smaller.<br/>
So it *can* make sense to use Hymn with a lute during a fight<br/>
at this level.  Most of the monsters we were fighting weren&#39;t<br/>
doing as much damage as the croc, and I was primarily using<br/>
Hymn to keep as close as possible to max hp in case things got<br/>
ugly and we had to run for the zone.<br/>
