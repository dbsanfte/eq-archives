<div id="ygrps-yiv-99000149">I just got the following from EQ Casters Realm regarding new bard songs for<br/>
the Velious expansion.  The link is:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/velious.asp">http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/velious.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
The songs are:<br/>
<br/>
Cantana of Soothing Party: Heal, Mana, and Stamina Regeneration 34<br/>
Melody of Ervaj Area Effect Mana Drain (Max: 225) 49<br/>
Shield of Song Group Damage Absorption (Max: 20 per tick) 50<br/>
Occlusion of Sound Single Target Magic Based Direct Damage (Max: 42) 55. <br/>
Composition of Ervaj Drain Mana From Target (Max: 350) 60.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously these are subject to change, but it appears we will get a damage<br/>
absorbtion song back for the one we lost (useful? who knows) and get an<br/>
earlier level Cantana (I really like this one).<br/>
<br/>
There are two mana drain songs in this list...which makes me wonder if<br/>
Velious creatures will actually have a limited mana pool.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the Direct Damage goes...dont we have a much better DD than this<br/>
in the mid-50&#39;s?<br/>
