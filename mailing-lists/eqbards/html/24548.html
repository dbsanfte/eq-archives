second Dru.<br/>

It must be 12 or 24 then.  We&#39;ve waiting 2 hours once, but got <br/>
bored. :)  What did you guys get to drop?  Wyld is wearing the 1hb <br/>
caster thing from her, looks like a sceptre and  I won the 1hb Mace <br/>
thing (not a bad item, has some cha on it) the last time we took her <br/>
down.  No sign of any NoS or the new Ranger/Druid? quest piece.<br/>

<br/>
Bah!  You call it a blessing, I call it a curse!  After talking to <br/>
Yvonne and hearing stories and encouragement about pulling when I was <br/>
about 56, I started pulling for most of our groups and am loving it.  <br/>
No disrespect to Shaquil, but Monks just get in the way of the true <br/>
dungeon pullers, Bards!<br/>

That was hilarious, lol.  We kept thinking you guys were heading out <br/>
and started looking greedily at the South Wing. :b<br/>
<br/>
Luckily we always have CoH available to our groups, so we can deal <br/>
with the falling in the pit blunders, but I&#39;m sorry to hear you got <br/>
stopped short of the Procurator... I&#39;m assuming you were going for <br/>
the Kylong BP?<br/>
<br/>
j/k :)<br/>
<br/>
Grats on 56 and the BP!  I heard Trak dropped another Bard BP over <br/>
the weekend, anyone know who got that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Darkfox<br/>

p.s. sorry to the rest of the list who don&#39;t want to be <br/>
reading &quot;Xegony Daily&quot;</div>
