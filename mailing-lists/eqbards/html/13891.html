&gt; Ok, maybe I&#39;m just cynical, but wouldn&#39;t this degenerate?  I imagine a level<br/>

&gt; moves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you tried this?  Even L30 mobs take enough out of you<br/>
that soloing you can probably only keep 5-15 mobs clear before<br/>
they start to respawn.  (Unless you&#39;re a necro, then you can<br/>
keep all the seafury cyclopses in OOT clear solo.  :)  A L50<br/>
in a L15 dungeon like Befallen I can see killing everything<br/>
that moves, but there&#39;s really not much there to attract a<br/>
L50.  There&#39;s the paw quest, but that&#39;s easily solved by<br/>
moving that quest item to a higher level dungeon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You do have to share the mobs with other groups.  It&#39;s just<br/>
not obvious because it gets mixed into the time it takes your<br/>
puller to find something.  If there are 20 people in a dungeon<br/>
with 100 mobs that respawn every 30 minutes, then that&#39;s 5<br/>
mobs per person per 30 minutes.  Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re<br/>
camping one spot or sweeping through.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; best place to get XP, not items.  Ever try Sol B on a crowded night?  Try<br/>
&gt; sitting in the noble room when there is a group in the circle room, pool<br/>
&gt; room and kings room.  See how many spawns you get.  Not many.  Now imagine a<br/>
&gt; dungeon where the good spawns can be anywhere or there are multiples...<br/>
&gt; suddenly all those groups camping a particular area are suddenly running<br/>
&gt; around and taking any spawns anywhere rather then sticking to there own<br/>
&gt; marked off area.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will be the same - the rate at which mobs respawn has not<br/>
changed.  Better sweepers would have an advantage, but better<br/>
pullers have an advantage now.  The overall rate of mob killer<br/>
per person per hour cannot change.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, even worse, imagine if the Goblin King in Sol A could happen to spawn<br/>
&gt; anywhere... what would those level 25&#39;s do who are fighting Cinders and<br/>
&gt; Youngs when the King suddenly spawns and bum rushes them.  The rare spawns<br/>
&gt; are deep in the dungeon on purpose...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously there would be certain restrictions on location of<br/>
spawns (based on a probability gradient if it were up to me,<br/>
not yes/no :).  Wouldn&#39;t want Naggy showing up at the zone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Personally I kinda like the way AC handles it by restricting dungeons to<br/>
&gt; certain levels and having a lot more dungeons... if you aren&#39;t in a level<br/>
&gt; range you cannot enter.  I&#39;d also like to see all really really good items<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aren&#39;t most of the magical items in AC randomly generic, like<br/>
in Diablo?<br/>
