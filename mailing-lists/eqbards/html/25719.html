<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097770148">JUST Mana and straggler chaser?  I think NOT!  First of all - AOE slow.<br/>
Those mobs are gonna be hitting low HP casters - so slows important.   AT 48<br/>
Selo&#39;s Cessation has a slow, a snare, and a DOT.  Drop the DOT for better<br/>
slow and snare at 54.  Denon&#39;s Discord gives some AoE Dottage.  And you can<br/>
throw in the level 2 AOE Dot for yucks.<br/>
<br/>
But the best thing for pulling?  You can only sing it during daytime - but<br/>
really the only use of Song of Highsun (56) is for PBAOE pulling.  It gates<br/>
mobs back to their spawn points and DOESN&#39;T clear agro.  The mob will come<br/>
back with as many friends as he can find between you and his spawn point.<br/>
<br/>
At night - sing Song of Midnight - Selo&#39;s and Fears mobs - they&#39;ll run away<br/>
FAST and come back with friends as well...<br/>

<br/>
from what I&#39;ve heard (not experienced yet) you probably won&#39;t even be<br/>
pulling, the wizards will with dd spells...<br/>
<br/>
you will be the mana provider and straggler chaser more than likely...<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s supposed to be just incredible XP for higher levels, have a cleric<br/>
friend who is doing it and getting enough to make it worthwhile for him at<br/>
52...<br/>

&gt;well i have been invited many times but never had the opportunity to join<br/>
&gt;one, though they say bards are needed. now i am not sure how aoe groups<br/>
&gt;exactly work and what a bards role in such a group is, so any advice is<br/>
&gt;welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i only know the bard should pull a lot of mobs, which get chainstunned by 2<br/>
&gt;chanters and then smoked by 3 AoE nukers. but do i sing anything else? any<br/>
&gt;special hint?<br/>
