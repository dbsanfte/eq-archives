I started my &quot;charming&quot; career in Kunark, so I guess I&#39;m used to it.  Its<br/>
very refreshing coming over to the Auld Country and not worrying about<br/>
re-issuing orders.  Just something you&#39;ve got to live with, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Lately in Frontier Mountains, on 3 or more giant pulls, I generally wait for<br/>
the tanks to do maybe 2 or 3 rounds of combat so they build up sufficient<br/>
hate.  Then I charm one, hit F8 and order it to attack.  I melee in with the<br/>
crowd, twisting a couple of songs and after a few, retarget my thrall.<br/>
<br/>
Once the charm breaks, I recharm and am meleeing my soon-to-be-charmed<br/>
giant, hit F8 again and send him back into the fight.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;ve only got one mob beating on you (your ex-pet) it&#39;s not quite so<br/>
bad.<br/>
<br/>
One way of handling your situation would be:  charm, hit F8, order to<br/>
attack.  Back off with either SoW or Selo&#39;s, keep your pet targetted,<br/>
recharm, run up to the crowd, hit F8 and order to attack again.<br/>
<br/>
My groups love it when I charm Giants.  One level 34 Shaman even had the<br/>
audacity to claim that Bards couldn&#39;t charm!  Oh, really?  Watch this!<br/>

Two solo&#39;d dead Tumps later, he was whistling a whole new tune. ;)<br/>
