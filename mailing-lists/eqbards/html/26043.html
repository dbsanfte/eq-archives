<b>Subject:</b> Hello and Questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552507593">Hello everyone, certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be much activity here.  Anyway, I<br/>
have been playing EQ for several years.  Not since Beta as so many like to<br/>
claim but since before Kunark.  I played around with a Magician and then a<br/>
Shadowknight and finally decided to make my run to the end with a Ranger.  I<br/>
have regretted it occasionally but not for long.  Rangers are fun but I<br/>
wanted to try out some other classes.  I have decided to make Bard my next<br/>
try.  I have gotten to lvl 30, which isn&#39;t nearly as hard as it was to get<br/>
to lvl 30 with my Ranger.  Mostly cuz of that not having to loot your corpse<br/>
until after lvl 10 and having the ability to get him some nice armor and<br/>
weapons.  Nothing spectacular in the least but much better than my poor<br/>
ranger could afford.<br/>
<br/>
I have figured out much about Bards and how they are played.  I have figured<br/>
out musical instruments and how to twist and swap out equipment.  Couple of<br/>
questions still remain.<br/>
<br/>
1) What is the advantage of the Chant we get at level 30 over other direct<br/>
damage songs like Brusco&#39;s?  Haven&#39;t bought it and memmed it yet but just<br/>
curious as to what it is for.<br/>
<br/>
2) Skills have been revamped.  You get skills at different levels now than<br/>
all the guides say you do.  And the caps seem to be different.  Does anybody<br/>
here know of a good updated list of this info?  Just as a for-instance,<br/>
Sense Traps and Disarm Traps is now capped at 120 as near as I can figure.<br/>
<br/>
3) Is it true that mana regeneration songs and spells do absolutely nothing<br/>
to help a Bard regen mana?  That nothing whatsoever except Flowing Thought<br/>
Items does?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
