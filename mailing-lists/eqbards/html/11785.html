<div id="ygrps-yiv-382613512">Hehe, one time my group was at the ghoul arch magi and the ghoul lord<br/>
was uncamped so we were pulling him as well. Well, a pull went bad and<br/>
we ended up with 2 bok knights, several dars, kor wizards etc. I mass<br/>
feared them and called for evac, but our wizard just sat there. Knowing<br/>
we could last very long, I told the cleric to heal me full then gate,<br/>
the monk FD&#39;d, and the other 2 party members were also able to gate.<br/>
What followed was me running while blaring mass fear with a HUGE train<br/>
through lower guk undead side. Because nothing was camped, it was<br/>
through full spawn. I unfortunately died about 100 feet to the zone line<br/>
from getting rooted, but you should have seen that overhead view of my<br/>
corpse - both boks still with me, 3-4 dars, a kor, several zols and<br/>
wans, all 5 greater ice bones (lol!) etc. The rest of the team,<br/>
fortunately all survived except for me. The wizard had gone afk without<br/>
telling anyone *sigh*, but what a memorable attempt at zoning that was.<br/>
At least the Corpse Recovery was easy for the cleric. =P<br/>
