15 songs ready, but there are only 8 song slots.  Either you<br/>
have to start sitting on your butt and switching songs when<br/>
the opportunity/situation presents itself.  Or you&#39;ll have to<br/>
give up one (or two or three) of those songs and let other<br/>
group members take over responsibility (snare instead of chain<br/>
for example).<br/>
