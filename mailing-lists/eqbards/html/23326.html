<b>Subject:</b> SS Arms vs Sleeve of the Ancient <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-119780622">I currently have SotA but someone offered to sell me SS arms for 2K over the<br/>
weekend.  The AC for the SS is 6 better than SotA, but the SotA provide STR<br/>
and CHR bonuses while the SS has no stat bonuses.  I have been waiting until<br/>
I dinged 50 before I started to hunt in Sebilis.  Well I dinged 50 this<br/>
weekend so plan to start going there soon.  Now I have heard that SS arms<br/>
are not that hard to acquire in Seb.  So I am debating if I should buy the<br/>
SS arms now or wait until I can loot them for myself.  The 2K will clean me<br/>
out so would prefer to loot them instead of buying them.  But if they are<br/>
harder to acquire than what I was told, then I may decide to fork out the<br/>
cash.  For those of you with a lot of experience fighting in Seb, would like<br/>
to hear what you have to say.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
