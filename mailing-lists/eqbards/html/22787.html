<div id="ygrps-yiv-726766687">There is still no refresh on charm.  Verant didn&#39;t actually say pets are<br/>
being treated as PC when proc&#39;ing.  Just that they would be proc&#39;ing under<br/>
the same benefits/restrictions as PC&#39;s.  The statement that people refer to<br/>
was a bad choice of words by Absor.<br/>
