&gt; Cool thought Gaelaian.  An you should be able to run away<br/>
&gt; from anything in the game, except one- Hasten<br/>
&gt; Bootstrutter.  One hint to high level bards- don&#39;t use<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting note about him.  Normally, if you attack a mob<br/>
that /cons amiably, it turns threatening and attacks me back.  <br/>
Hasten is amiable to me.  I charmed a hill giant just as he<br/>
attacked it, and the giant attacked him back.  I was getting<br/>
ready to zone, Hasten killed the giant, then went on his merry<br/>
way.  I conned him and he was dubious to me.  Apparently<br/>
having a pet auto-defend against a mob is not as big a combat<br/>
faction hit as attacking the mob directly.<br/>
