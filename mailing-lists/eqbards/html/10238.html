&gt; &gt; How much of a slowdown did the shaman spell have?  I&#39;ve been<br/>

&gt; &gt; a mob we were fighting.  Her spell was a much greater slowdown<br/>
&gt; &gt; than Chain would&#39;ve caused, and based on my eyeball<br/>
&gt; &gt; observations (combat was too hectic to use a stopwatch) Chain<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t override the spell.<br/>

&gt;    Incredible slowdown effect.  I mean to the tune of hundreds<br/>
&gt;    of percent slower.  I&#39;d say an ice giant normally would double<br/>
&gt;    attack every 2 secs or so.  With L49 drowsy, the ice giant would<br/>
&gt;    only swing every 6-8 secs.  It&#39;s that much of a slowdown.  But<br/>
&gt;    as soon as I chained it, it started wailing on me again fast.<br/>

else here can if they have the time).  Stronger effects are<br/>
supposed to override weaker ones, and weaker ones aren&#39;t<br/>
supposed to take hold over stronger ones.  Maybe the shaman<br/>
drowsy spells are bugged in this regard.  Do they do anything<br/>
except slow down the mob?<br/>
