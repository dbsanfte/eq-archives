&gt;    Incredible slowdown effect.  I mean to the tune of hundreds<br/>
&gt;    of percent slower.  I&#39;d say an ice giant normally would double<br/>
&gt;    attack every 2 secs or so.  With L49 drowsy, the ice giant would<br/>
&gt;    only swing every 6-8 secs.  It&#39;s that much of a slowdown.  But<br/>
&gt;    as soon as I chained it, it started wailing on me again fast.<br/>

else here can if they have the time).  Stronger effects are<br/>
supposed to override weaker ones, and weaker ones aren&#39;t<br/>
supposed to take hold over stronger ones.  Maybe the shaman<br/>
drowsy spells are bugged in this regard.  Do they do anything<br/>
except slow down the mob?<br/>
