<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312274985">Mahlin&#39;s Mystical Bongo&#39;s (Unknown where this is found) <br/>
Percussion instrument - gives no statistic enhancements, but does appear to <br/>
give an 8% improvement for drummed songs.  This is part of the Bard Epic <br/>
Quest, resulting in the Singing Short Sword.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Mahlin&#39;s Mystical Bongo&#39;s are rewarded by Baenar Swiftsong (South Karana<br/>
near the well) after you give him the head from Maligar&#39;s Enraged<br/>
Doppleganger (West Karana).  You use the Bongo&#39;s to get the bottom half of<br/>
page 24.  You could use the bongo&#39;s as an interim reward, but I would think<br/>
most bards will have better percussion instruments (Tambourine or MM drums<br/>
at least) by the time they can kill Maligar.<br/>
