8)Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>
8)Speaking of Ghoulsbanes swords, my paladin husband has always maintained<br/>
8)that the sword casts it&#39;s spell more often based on the wielder&#39;s dex.<br/>
After<br/>
8)camping and finally getting these for 2 of the guild paladins (*sigh*, one<br/>
8)more to go), we went to lower guk for a break. It occurred to me to switch<br/>
8)from Anthem to Chant for the dex boost to see if that would get more casts<br/>
8)on the undead frogs. One paladin was pretty sure it did help. Since then,<br/>
8)they have debated whether to get dex boost items. The other paladin got<br/>
some<br/>
8)dex boosts later on and now thinks it makes no difference. The point of<br/>
this<br/>
8)ramble: when fighting undead with paladins using Ghoulsbanes, try Chant<br/>
and<br/>
8)see if they think it helps the sword&#39;s casts.<br/>
<br/>
	My bard friend has a non-buff dex of something insane like 167 and can buff<br/>
it to over 200 often. He also has a Staff of Writhing and he sayd that the<br/>
effect procs all the time.<br/>
<br/>
8)I finally hit hell 1, L30 after many misadventures. Ever wonder what is in<br/>
8)the caves under the aviak guard island in Lake Rathe? I can confirm that<br/>
8)cave connects to the cave under the island straight out from the docks at<br/>
8)the Rathe Mountain zone pass. I can also tell you that L40ish spellcasting<br/>
8)deepwater goblins live in the tower in the cave underwater. Great place to<br/>
8)die. Fortunately, we did this exploration prior to me leveling. Not much<br/>
8)chance of a rez there, lol.<br/>
<br/>
	A level 40? When I checked it out around 19th or 20th all I saw were greens<br/>
and one blue caster in the tower. Maybe it&#39;s a rare spawn that you saw...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>
