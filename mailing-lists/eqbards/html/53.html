<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937412388">The quest, while boring, is lucrative.  You trade in 4 spider silks, which<br/>
can be purchased for about 1 GP total, and you trade it in for 3 GP<br/>
(selling drum of course)  and change plus XP..   I always make it a point<br/>
to buy out every spider silk I find in stores plus kill every spider i<br/>
find.  It does take up a lot of space in your packs but when you have a few<br/>
backpacks it makes it worth it..<br/>

Greetings all, I am the wood-elf Kendrin, bard of the 4th rank, in<br/>
Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question regarding the quest given by Sylia Windlehands -- how<br/>
many times can you do it?  Every time I talk to her (hoping to get another<br/>
quest) she asks me for the spiderling silks.  Having done this quest 3 or 4<br/>
times, I can only ask -- how many lutes do they have there that need<br/>
strings?<br/>
<br/>
Are there other quests in Kelethin that a bard can do, aside from offering<br/>
to locate people&#39;s corpses for them?<br/>
