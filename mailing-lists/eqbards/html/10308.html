Chant of battle + chain (+ hymn).<br/>
<br/>
Chant buffs both your str and dex by half the amount Anthem<br/>
buffs str, so to my mind the stat buffs are a equal.  <br/>
Warsong&#39;s speedup overrides Anthem&#39;s, so speedup is not a<br/>
factor.  Finally, Chant grants an AC bonus whereas Anthem does<br/>
not.  So to me that makes it the better choice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d swap Psalm of warmth/cooling for Chain if I&#39;m getting an<br/>
unusually large number of resists (some mobs are more<br/>
resistant, sometimes they&#39;re buffed by a casting mob).  <br/>
Whether or not the mob dual wields/double attacks and how much<br/>
damage it does per hit on average also plays a factor.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I was not that impressed with the additional<br/>
damage I did with the str buff of Anthem or str/dex buff of<br/>
Chant.  Since most mobs typically get a hit in at least once<br/>
every 3 seconds on average, in order for Anthem/Chant to be<br/>
better than Psalm, I&#39;d have to be seeing my average damage go<br/>
up about 4-7 points every 3 seconds, which it doesn&#39;t.  So<br/>
when I solo, I usually go with Warsong + Hymn + Psalm + Chain<br/>
in that order of preference if I can manage it.<br/>
