<div id="ygrps-yiv-572939093">Hmmm, I have 1 piece of studded leather left on me at this point.  I have no<br/>
banded, but that&#39;s mainly because all my armor is magical except my boots.<br/>
I am a tradesman and so actually have armor pieces well over my level.  I<br/>
have the following armor, from memory:<br/>
<br/>
	Crush&#39;s Tunic<br/>
	Silver plated Bracer<br/>
	Barbed Arms<br/>
	Barbed Legs<br/>
	Studded Boots<br/>
	Purity Belt<br/>
	BloodStained Mantle<br/>
	Bracer of Erolissi<br/>
	Snakeskin Gloves<br/>
	Jagged Band<br/>
	Snakeskin Mask<br/>
	Leatherfoot Raider&#39;s Cap (My one weak piece of armor)<br/>
	AC 3 Necklace with +6 Poison Resist (For hunting those Spider Silks)<br/>
	Shiny Brass Shield<br/>
<br/>
	Not sure what that makes my total AC, something like 375 as I<br/>
recall.  The Shaman was a Barbarian with a 93 agility so I&#39;m not that much<br/>
better, his Armor was mostly Banded with a few magic pieces.  Bronze is too<br/>
heavy for me, my natural strength is only 73, 86 with Mods.  I need to get<br/>
another Jagged Band which will add about 8 more AC points.  I could switch<br/>
out my agility earrings, but a 106 agility gives me 3 ac points over the 102<br/>
I would drop back to, so its nearly a wash.<br/>
<br/>
	I have 1 backpack and 2 sewing kits.  Also a traveller&#39;s pouch for<br/>
those heavy, small items.  Sewing Kits are great they weigh very little and<br/>
hold bigger stuff than backpacks like scythes and magic hay :-)<br/>
<br/>
	All in all I think I am at least as well equipped as most bards of<br/>
my level.  My armor is lighter than full banded and gives more AC.  It also<br/>
gives good stat bonuses and I laugh at spellcasters, other than those damn<br/>
druid bandits.  One of them is no problem, but two is impossible.  Druids<br/>
are ridiculously overpowered, I&#39;d rather fight a wizard.  I&#39;ve been looking<br/>
to replace the Raider Helm, but have not found anything better and that<br/>
bronze helm looks way too stupid to even consider. :-(<br/>
