<div id="ygrps-yiv-335723233">Assuming the raid leader know what he/she is doing there is no reason for a<br/>
Vox/Naggy raid to fail.  The melee damage output with kunark/sov weapons is<br/>
so much higher than what those 2 were tuned for.  Not to mention these raids<br/>
often have access to high level buffs<br/>
<br/>
The problem (at least on the raids I went to) is that the munchkin mob has<br/>
had enough time to get to 50 now.  Obviously there were lvl 50 idiots pre<br/>
kunark, but they were less and often easily identifible (from what I was<br/>
hearing at that time).  Now they have Sebillis keys.<br/>
<br/>
When I went on my first Vox raid, I sat there silently, in terror that I<br/>
would screw something up.  I turned off guild chat and told all my friends<br/>
to not send me tells.  I asked this list and the high level bards (I think I<br/>
sent you a tell Sartori, hehehe) what I should be doing.<br/>
<br/>
I am not talking about a young guild/ coalition making an honest attempt at<br/>
Vox and failing here.  I admire people who try new (to them) things.  I am<br/>
talking about a vetran raid leader who can&#39;t get enough competent players<br/>
who merely listen to him to kill a old world dragon.  I am talking people<br/>
who blantantly ignore the directions given to them by the raid leader.<br/>
Theres nothing hard about understanding &quot;DO NOT BUFF YOUR PARTY.  NO ONE<br/>
SHOULD HAVE ANY BUFFS&lt; IF YOU HAVE BUFFS, DISPEL THEM.&quot;  Theres nothing hard<br/>
about &quot;Do not send me tells about loot, the looting rules were made public<br/>
before the raid and will be repeated before we make groups.&quot; There is<br/>
nothing hard about &quot;Do not move past me, if you fall in a pit or agro a mob,<br/>
especially Vox, do not try to run, just stand there and die, we will rez<br/>
you.&quot;<br/>
