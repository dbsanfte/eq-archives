<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029042913">I believe _applying_ any damage doing spell has a chance to break root.<br/>
This would include DD (Below) and DOTs (Chants).  If it doesn&#39;t break root<br/>
on application, it will have to expire on it&#39;s own or when another damage<br/>
doing spell is applied.  I watched my brother&#39;s Shaman stack 2 DOTs, Root,<br/>
and sit to med while watching the mobs hps drop... rerooting as necessary,<br/>
but usually was a long time.  If he would have Rooted, then applied the<br/>
DOTs, root would have expired much more often.<br/>
<br/>
I think what you were noticing is the % chance that root has to break with<br/>
any of these types of damage.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d agree that the short duration makes our DOTs weaker than necro&#39;s and<br/>
shamen, but then again, I can&#39;t think of _any_ party I&#39;ve been in where DOT<br/>
has been the only damge killing the mob.  Of course, I doubt I ever will,<br/>
cause I&#39;m always grouped with my GF&#39;s Mage... one word:  Pet. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay,  another thought...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We know that mobs do NOT follow the same rules as PC&#39;s...<br/>
&gt; &gt; You can stack a number of both offensive and defensive effects on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; pc...(don&#39;t know if there is actually a hard limit...i&#39;ve been well into<br/>

&gt; &gt; this is a big what if...<br/>
&gt; &gt; What if you can only put X many offensive spells onto a mob...<br/>
&gt; &gt; i.e. root, dot 1, dot 2, dot 3, DD...so you have 5 effects...<br/>
&gt; &gt; now, here comes ... bellow: 6 effects...nope, can&#39;t have<br/>

&gt; &gt; okay, root it again...6 effects, can&#39;t have that, overwrite the first<br/>

&gt; &gt; now, here comes chant, 6 effects, can&#39;t have that, overwrite the first<br/>
&gt; &gt; one...root...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i am NOT saying this is how it works, but it would start to fit what you<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; talking about.  Plus, this seems to be shot down by the multi-groups<br/>
&gt; taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; out dragons and what not, possibly and probably not working on<br/>
&gt; &gt; uber-mobs...BUT, what if it IS taking place, but we don&#39;t realize<br/>
&gt; it...then<br/>
&gt; &gt; that Necro&#39;s big DOT get&#39;s overwritten by some effect that is not nearly<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; No - it&#39;s not that simple.  I tested extensively.  Sometimes Bellows<br/>
