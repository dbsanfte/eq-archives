<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052080197">Ok, why can&#39;t we have multiple use songs, kinda like alchemy but we make<br/>
our own songs, ie Song Writing skill. ie you could write a song that does<br/>
both Invis and See invis at the same time, or snare and Bellow  =)<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of this idea?<br/>

&gt; A simple song to fill in a missing gap.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I had sent that in as a suggestion several months ago via the<br/>
  /feedback command.  It would really waste a song slot for something<br/>
  much more useful on a widespread level.  But there are times when<br/>
  I get tired of begging people for an invis at the deadside zone of<br/>
  lguk.<br/>
<br/>
  Until recently, I just realized /feedback is just a link to the<br/>
  /ignore command.  Because that&#39;s what the summarily do with your<br/>
  suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
  When is our L47 song comming?  Sheesh, they must be really testing<br/>
  the crap out of it. &lt;sarcasm sarcasm sarcasm&gt;<br/>
