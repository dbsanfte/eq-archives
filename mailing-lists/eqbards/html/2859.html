<div id="ygrps-yiv-664969087">As part of my RP I thought I would take on this trade. Though it nets no<br/>
real cash to speak of, I thought what the hell. I have some<br/>
thoughts/questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. Bards should inherently be good at this skill and maybe should have bard<br/>
only recipes or something.<br/>
<br/>
2. AND THIS IS A RANT...why the hell are there no recipes for taking the<br/>
skill past 135? I tire of the &quot;not yet implemented&quot; excuse. Grrr....we are<br/>
still in beta if something like a trade skill is not complete. RANT COMPLETE<br/>
<br/>
3. What is the recipe for Bog Juice? Surely some fellow bards have taken up<br/>
brewing. And while I have brewed everything and searched high and low for<br/>
this recipe I cannot find it...though I hear the quest for this is broken<br/>
too. grrr<br/>
<br/>
4. Did 19 prove to be a difficult level for you that made it passed? I seem<br/>
to be wallowing in low 19.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Cleaver, Fennin Ro</div>
