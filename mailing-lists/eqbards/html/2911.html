<div id="ygrps-yiv-160090095">Lavastorm. I am level 14 and it is a great soloing place. Instructions:<br/>
<br/>
As you enter the Nektulos (use your drum, you very much want the speed) hug the zone to your left,<br/>
swim the piranha infested river (leaving a chunk or two of your flesh as a toll) and fly all the way<br/>
to Lavastorm. Do not gawk at the stone guardians *laughs* as a Teir&#39;Dal they are your good friends,<br/>
as a Fier&#39;Dal they will kill ya dead.<br/>
<br/>
In lavastorm go after the Fire drakes, rock dervishes and maybe the fire imps. Even greens were<br/>
giving exp at 14 btw.  Avoid the Fire Elementals, blues were kicking my butt. You might do okay with<br/>
a green. Lava Crawlers are WAY more than they appear. I generally hunt the area between the entrance<br/>
and Najena (keeping me close to a zone *laughs*).<br/>
Use Elemental rhythms constantly on Drakes, Imps and Elems. I was weaving Anthem, Elemental Rhythms<br/>
and Bellow. Though it depends on your weapon, I am finding using Bellow after Bellow (on regular<br/>
monsters, or say, the Rock Dervishes) to not be as effective as Anthem/Bellow/Bellow/Anthem because<br/>
Anthem with my Dragoon Dagger is a very very potent mix.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, have fun, oh and occasionally a Stone Guardian will wander close to the Lavastorm Entrance<br/>
in Neriak, so just prepare yourself, you may not be zoning to safety.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I just kept laughing that I was there at all. On Rallos Zek (where I played until<br/>
it was maliciously and negligently hozed by Verant) as a wood elf I would have been hunted down like<br/>
a dog. *laughs*, so enjoy your reletive freedom in that part of the world! :o)<br/>
