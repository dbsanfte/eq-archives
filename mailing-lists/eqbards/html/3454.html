&gt; Well met everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is not a complaint mind you. Soloing has made me into a hardy adventure<br/>
&gt; able to cope with circumstance well beyond my meager skills. Has anyone else<br/>
&gt; had experiences similar to these?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;ve been soloing almost non-stop, all the way up to level 11 now.<br/>
Due to my random hours and such, even those I used to journey with for a<br/>
day or two are now too far ahead of me for me to group with.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t mind soloing, again because of my random hours, since<br/>
it allows me to go where I want, when I want (well, within reason--Bards<br/>
still need to have the ability to bind themselves in my mind.  Ain&#39;t no<br/>
way I&#39;m gonna pay greedy spellcasters for that, especially now that some<br/>
of them have started charging platinum.)<br/>
