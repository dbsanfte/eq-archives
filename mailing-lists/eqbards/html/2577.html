If you&#39;ll bear with me, I&#39;ll wax a little philosophically<br/>
here.  We&#39;re at the genesis of an entirely new form of social<br/>
playground.  All that stuff you&#39;ve been reading and hearing<br/>
about virtual reality?  Well it&#39;s starting to take form, here,<br/>
now, first with MUDs, now with games like UO and EQ.<br/>
<br/>
The real world doesn&#39;t quite know what to make of all this.  <br/>
Heck, they didn&#39;t even know what to make of software when it<br/>
first became commercialized.  That lead to widespread piracy<br/>
with little enforcement of copyright laws.  That&#39;s slowly<br/>
changing as the software industry has legitimized itself in<br/>
the eyes of the everyday Joe.  Then came the Internet and we<br/>
had the same thing all over again, with email harassment/spam,<br/>
copying web pages, hacking networks, etc.  Slowly people are<br/>
beginning to take these crimes seriously as if they&#39;d<br/>
happened in the physical realm instead of in electronic 1s<br/>
and 0s.<br/>
<br/>
Now we&#39;re creatinging virtual worlds.  They&#39;ll start off<br/>
unrespected, with no consequences if you &quot;cheat.&quot;  Eventually<br/>
they&#39;ll gain respect and people will accept them as an<br/>
extension of the real world.  Will virtual cheating be taken<br/>
as seriously as real world cheating?  I don&#39;t know, only<br/>
history will answer that.  But the concept of banning,<br/>
expulsion, and fines for cheating or harassment in a public<br/>
entertainment venue is not alien.  Look at professional<br/>
sports, theme parks, public playgrounds, etc.  Cheat, cut in<br/>
line, abuse the other players or spectators, or generally make<br/>
an ass of yourself, and you&#39;ll get tossed out in a jiffy or<br/>
even jailed.<br/>
<br/>
Take notes.  Your grandkids will want to know what the world<br/>
was like before all this.  Just like you asked your<br/>
grandparents what the world was like before airplanes and TVs<br/>
and automobiles.<br/>
