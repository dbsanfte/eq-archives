<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327462224">I spent an evening in Droga this past week.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing saw through my invis song at all.<br/>
<br/>
My group killed a few of the &quot;goblin fanatics&quot; that wield those books. They<br/>
seemed to drop two varieties of books. I can&#39;t remember the specific stats,<br/>
but one book was something like +10 Int for Iskar necros only. The other<br/>
book was much better. It was something like +9 Wis, + other stats, +10 Fire<br/>
resist. Seems like it was cleric/shaman, all/all. I think the necro book is<br/>
the common drop from the fanatics and the +9 Wis book is a rare, as all the<br/>
fanatics we killed had one or the other.<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn, the range slot item you&#39;re speaking of is a totem of some sort,<br/>
rumored to drop there from the Goblin Soothsayers. We killed several<br/>
soothsayers looking for this item as well. We never saw a totem, but all of<br/>
the soothsayers dropped the same gemstone - a common gem that was cash loot<br/>
and not a quest item, if I remember correctly. It lead us to believe that<br/>
the gemstone is the common drop and the totem is the rare. Of course, we<br/>
won&#39;t know for sure until we return and actually find a totem, or read a<br/>
report from someone who has.<br/>
<br/>
Also, definitely print out a map of the place. I fell into the pit trap also<br/>
and had to wait for a goblin guard to open the door for me to escape.<br/>

&gt; There&#39;s no garauntee that the book has anything to do with the quest.  In<br/>
&gt; fact, I would think that a recipe would drop as a scroll and not a book, and<br/>
&gt; not off of a &quot;Goblin Fanatic&quot; but a &quot;Goblin Pastry Chef&quot; hehe... but who<br/>
&gt; knows.  Verant has surprised me before.  A lot.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyone have much experience in Droga?  There&#39;s a nifty range slot item,<br/>
&gt;&gt; 10ac, 7str, 10sta that drops in there.  Just wondering how hard<br/>
&gt;&gt; the dungeon<br/>
&gt;&gt; is, if mobs see invis, etc.<br/>
