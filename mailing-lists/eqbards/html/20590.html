<b>Subject:</b> Firiona Vie Quest Lead?  (OT?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460138613">I sent this info to Allakhazam, but has anyone else heard of this or any<br/>
tailoring recipes that might require more than 8 items?<br/>
<br/>
Ran across an interesting possible quest lead in Firona Vie last night.<br/>
Below is the relevant dialog.  I could not get him to respond to any other<br/>
keywords.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, and had I not had a lucky click of the mouse I would have<br/>
forgotten the whole thing, I clicked on the loom in his house.  Much to my<br/>
surprise it opened up into a 12 slot Sewing Kit complete with combine<br/>
button!  Now if I could just figure out how to get it into the bank... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Dialog:<br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;hail Dionin Needlespin&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Dionin Needlespin   sets down a needle and thread and a bolt of cloth.<br/>
Greetings my friend.  I am the tailor of this outpost.  We have limited<br/>
supplies.  I often have to preserve my tailoring supplies to [mend very<br/>
large items].<br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;How do you mend very large items?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Dionin Needlespin says &#39;I cannot use a sewing kit to mend items such as ship<br/>
sail.  I must use my loom outside.  I have the only one available in Kunark,<br/>
but only I am allowed to use it.  I can&#39;t have other breaking it.  I have<br/>
heard there is an old one in an ancient and ruined library.<br/>
