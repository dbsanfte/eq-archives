<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707199712"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;What are good defensive tools against melee mobs? <br/>
&gt; The Damage shields seem<br/>
&gt; &gt;weak considering we are fighting 1 mob 90% of the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree...our damage shields are weak.  On the<br/>
other hand, I was at the gob mines the other day<br/>
(Lake) and ran into a party of 5 that had made a bad<br/>
pull.  I used Largos to slow things down a bit.  Then<br/>
they invited me into the gorup and I would up DDD and<br/>
COD with Hymm.  <br/>
<br/>
Once that group say each of the six gobs attacking<br/>
them light up like a Christmas tree, they were very<br/>
happy to have me.  We finished off the fight with only<br/>
one death, a wound-crazed caster who ran off.<br/>
<br/>
For me the morale of the story is clear:  Sometimes<br/>
you ride shotgun, sometimes you ride in the back. <br/>
Either way, people who have adventured with a good<br/>
bard always want them around.  <br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t the badest guys on the block, but we&#39;re<br/>
great to have when you&#39;re in a bad spot.<br/>
