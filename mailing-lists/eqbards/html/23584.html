<b>Subject:</b> Soloing bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662611405">Since I&#39;m not the soloing type with any of my characters, I had no idea so<br/>
many bards soloed into the 40s or higher.  I knew that druids and necros<br/>
often did it, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
This certainly explains a lot, though.  Sooner or later, most of those<br/>
soloers get a taste for toys that lures them into dungeons, where they<br/>
proceed to be completely useless members of a group, wasting a slot and<br/>
often getting the group killed through sheer lack of ability to play their<br/>
class in a group setting.<br/>
<br/>
Having grown up as a bard, I didn&#39;t get to see these bards in action.  I<br/>
mean, how often do you see two bards in a dungeon group?  However, now that<br/>
I&#39;m playing an enchanter, I get to see lots of bards.  And what I see often<br/>
disturbs me.  They sing haste, even though it doesn&#39;t stack with my haste.<br/>
They sing dots in an attempt to do as much damage as possible (soloing<br/>
attitude, I&#39;m guessing).  They start chaining the mob at the beginning of<br/>
the combat.  They practice instill doubt during combat.  They pull out<br/>
instruments at innapropriate times.  They cry like children when you ask<br/>
them to play mana.  Ask them to keep 2 targets mezzed and they look at you<br/>
funny.  In short, the bards I&#39;m grouping with seem so clueless about their<br/>
class that they&#39;re actually detrimental to the group.<br/>
<br/>
Are these the bards who grew up kiting, charm-kiting or duoing?  When I<br/>
played a bard, I saw how a bard who wasn&#39;t interested in outdamaging the<br/>
warriors could uplift a group and make them able to do great things.  The<br/>
bards I group with now can&#39;t even understand why aggroing a mob is a bad<br/>
thing, and don&#39;t put those actions together with the cleric shouting OOM and<br/>
the resulting evac/run for the zone/death.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of a sad thing to see, really.  And I&#39;m sure I&#39;m harder on the<br/>
bard class than on others I see not being played very well, because I grew<br/>
up as one.  But it really is painful and disheartening that when I see two<br/>
or three people shouting for a group, and one of them is a bard...  Out of<br/>
hard-learned experience, I&#39;ll take one of the other two people over the<br/>
bard.  If I know the bard, and know that s/he is a good one, I&#39;ll add him or<br/>
her to the group.  But if all 3 are strangers, the bard almost never wins.<br/>
Sucks if I pass up a great bard who would have made the night fly by with<br/>
tons of xp and fun, but the odds are against it.  Chances are the bard is<br/>
one of the above examples instead, and won&#39;t be very helpful in the group.<br/>
