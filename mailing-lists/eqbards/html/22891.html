<div id="ygrps-yiv-548052418">This isn&#39;t particularly bard related, but since we bards tend to gather all<br/>
sorts of trivial information I thought someone might know.  Maybe I&#39;m just<br/>
feeling rangerly having finally gotten Tracking!  I have seen several guards<br/>
in Thurgadin walking around with Crossbows, does anyone know what these<br/>
items are or what stats they have?<br/>
