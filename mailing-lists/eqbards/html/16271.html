never get one :-(<br/>

People tell me to buy or trade for it, but 8000-10000pp worth of coin or<br/>
trade items is simply not anything I am anywhere near having access to, ahh<br/>

&gt; Last night my friend and I managed to get invited into the <br/>
&gt; Lord group. When<br/>
&gt; we arrived the group was killing 2 boks, after they were dead <br/>
&gt; 2 people left<br/>
&gt; and we replaced them. 10 minutes after joining the Lord <br/>
&gt; spawned with a Yak<br/>
&gt; and we killed him. I won the roll with a 52  =P<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next time round we had 2 boks spawn and being only level <br/>
&gt; 40 I was a bit<br/>
&gt; dubious as to whether Kelins Lugubrious Lament would be resisted. Our<br/>
&gt; warrior was gonna pull them both but I said wait. Told the <br/>
&gt; cleric to get<br/>
&gt; ready to heal me big time, I then attempted the Lament on the <br/>
&gt; right bok. It<br/>
&gt; stuck, I turned round and chained the left bok and he came <br/>
&gt; solo. The group<br/>
&gt; was impressed and I got comments like wow, great pull mad, <br/>
&gt; excellent work<br/>
&gt; and bards are great. I was pleased to see comments like this <br/>
&gt; as I often<br/>
&gt; feel that bards are only regarded as crack dealers. It&#39;s good <br/>
&gt; to let other<br/>
&gt; people see the value of bards in a group over than mana song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, pulling the 1 bok enable us to break the spawn and made life<br/>
&gt; easier, shortly after we finished the 2nd bok another Lord <br/>
&gt; with the Yak<br/>
&gt; spawned (I didn&#39;t roll). All in all a good night, got a Yak <br/>
&gt; and a Burlupp<br/>
&gt; sack and am less than a bubble to level 41.<br/>
