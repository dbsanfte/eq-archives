*Baltimore Fan Faire - Last Chance*<br/>
<br/>
Monday is the registration deadline for the Baltimore Fan Faire! We are<br/>
almost sold out so hurry and visit<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html</a> before you miss<br/>
your chance to attend this event!<br/>
<br/>
*Patch Day*<br/>
<br/>
The primary focus of today&#39;s patch is to implement changes noted in the new<br/>
Producer&#39;s Letter which can be found at<br/>

<br/>
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you read the Producer&#39;s Letter before playing<br/>
EverQuest.  It contains some unprecedented and exciting enhancements to<br/>
gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these changes, the following changes have been implemented:<br/>
<br/>
*Bug Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed a bug that caused &quot;root&quot; and &quot;snare&quot; type spells to function<br/>
incorrectly when stacked.  They should now stack properly.<br/>
- Fixed a bug that negated the &quot;instrument modifier&quot; for bards using Selo&#39;s,<br/>
causing them to run slower than they otherwise would.<br/>
- Fixed a bug that allowed two or more spells that grant levitation to<br/>
stack.  Levitation spells should not stack.<br/>
- The &quot;Track Corpse&quot; spell now works.<br/>
- Tracked down and eliminated several bugs that were causing a very small<br/>
percentage of people to crash when zoning or upon entering the game.<br/>
- Fixed a problem with some Ulthork armor that caused it to disappear on<br/>
death if the wearer was of extremely low level.<br/>
- Tserrina&#39;s Whip has been fixed.  If you received one prior to today&#39;s<br/>
patch, you will need to trade out your whip with a GM in order to get one<br/>
that works correctly.<br/>
- Last week&#39;s patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing,<br/>
and Torpor, so that they would stack another similar spell, unintentionally<br/>
causing it to stop stacking with standard regeneration spells.  This has<br/>
been fixed.  The downside to this fix is that these spells will now<br/>
overwrite the &quot;Call of Bones&quot; series.  As the three former spells are cast<br/>
to save a character&#39;s life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial<br/>
for all of those involved.<br/>
- The stronger /lootnodrop options will no longer prompt you for<br/>
confirmation when looting your own corpse.  It is highly suggested that<br/>
everyone reset their option to the strongest security available: /lootnodrop<br/>
ALWAYS (always ask for confirmation).<br/>
- Added some code to address an issue reported by a few players, that being<br/>
that an NPC named &quot;Ragefire&quot; would die and not leave a corpse.  Though we<br/>
were unable to reproduce this problem in testing, the code we added should<br/>
function as a catch-all for this problem.  Please be sure to let us know how<br/>
this goes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Changes/Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
- While not mentioned in the Producer&#39;s Letter, the Zone Experience Modifier<br/>
has also been increased in Guk (guktop), by roughly 12%.<br/>
- &quot;Lay on Hands&quot; has been enhanced again to heal more hitpoints.<br/>
- Overlooked in the last patch message, new spells were made available to<br/>
Rangers and Paladins in the upper levels.<br/>
- &quot;Voice of the Berserker&quot;, a beneficial spell, no longer drains mana over<br/>
the duration of the spell.<br/>
- The maximum duration of &quot;Strength of Nature&quot; has been increased.<br/>
- A new spell for magicians is now available in game.<br/>
- The &quot;Shield of the Eighth&quot; spell will now last a number of minutes equal<br/>
to your level.<br/>
- You can now use the arrow and enter keys to select characters in the<br/>
character select screen.  In addition, the last character you chose will be<br/>
automatically hilighted when entering that screen.  This value is stored in<br/>
the EQCLIENT.INI file as &quot;LastCharSel=0-7&quot;<br/>
- The ranger&#39;s &quot;Trueshot&quot; discipline has had its damage increased after<br/>
analyzing data from its fix last week.  Prior to the last patch, all bows,<br/>
while under the discipline, were hitting as if they were 45dmg bows<br/>
regardless of the delay. Last week&#39;s patch fixed it so that damage was based<br/>
on the damage of the bow.  This weeks patch increases damage bonuses in<br/>
relation to delay (longer delays yield better damage bonuses).<br/>
- You can now reverse the left and right channels on your speakers using the<br/>
/reversesound command.  This should be very useful for those who have had to<br/>
place their speakers backwards due to cable lengths.<br/>
- Made some improvements to Paw, Mistmoore, and The Hole, to address some<br/>
concerns brought forth by the players.  Both zones had some problems that<br/>
would cause them to be exceedingly difficult in some cases.<br/>
