<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-819650498">Well I&#39;m pretty sure the Chant of Flame checks against Heat resist<br/>
because after a few explores into Solusek, the goblins down there seem<br/>
to be immune to it and resist every time.<br/>
<br/>
Although what with resists against songs being as bad as they are, you<br/>
can never tell ... I really do get tired of how resisted my chains<br/>
song is *sigh*<br/>

&gt;me it would seem to make more sense that these two songs are exceptions and<br/>
&gt;use the mob&#39;s fire/cold resist rate.  Can somebody confirm what the correct<br/>
