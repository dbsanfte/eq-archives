<b>Subject:</b> Become a Paid Video Game Tester Without Training! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-736260260">If you&#39;re just dieing to be a paid video game tester and want to quit your normal 9-5 job, then you need to listen up. Video game testing is a JOB, not a hobby! Yes, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s entertaining, and it pays well -- but that doesn&#39;t mean you can just do what you want when you want. As with any other type of employment, you have to do the tasks you are assigned in a timely, professional manner.<br/>
Failing repeatedly in your tasks will result in a loss of your testing job, as well as any reference you might have gained from that game developer. That said, really put effort into your testing assignment if you want to go far as a video game tester. If you put in half-ass efforts, you&#39;ll get half-ass results, period!<br/>
How to Become a Tester Without Training<br/>
Believe it or not, game testers don&#39;t require formal training of any kind. Obviously, you&#39;ll likely be more successful and climb up the ladder faster if you do indeed have training that&#39;ll aid in your game testing -- but by no means is it &quot;must have&quot; prerequisite.<br/>
To be honest, you only need to have the following to become a paid video game tester...<br/>
- Experience playing video games (The more the better)<br/>
- A good eye for detail (IMPORTANT!)<br/>
- A high end PC and/or a next-gen console (PS3 or XBOX 360) to complete your &quot;assignments&quot; on<br/>
- Internet connection and computer so you can send in testing reports and get updates<br/>
- Must Be 18 years Old. Some companies will make exceptions, but not many<br/>
If you can meet these requirements, or at least the majority of them, you &quot;qualify&quot; to be a paid video game tester. Does this mean you&#39;ll be able to get a job testing video games immediately? Unfortunately, no -- it just means you are a person game developers would seriously consider hiring as a game tester. <br/>
