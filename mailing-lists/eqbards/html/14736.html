&gt;&gt; &gt; When we were first exploring lower guk, back when there was 8-10 ppl in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the zone, I used lullaby at least once on an over pull in the undead<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; tower. It worked and we all lived.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;   With your knowledge of Lullaby now, would you even consider firing<br/>
&gt;&gt;   up that song in LGuk?  Lullaby was awesome when I used it, oh about<br/>
&gt;&gt;   30 levels ago.  I can&#39;t even keep 3 snakes asleep now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrm... Interesting. Maybe you have something here.<br/>
<br/>
My friend has a level 27 cleric that she plays sometimes. I was watching<br/>
over her shoulder and they had a mid-20s bard in their group in Sol A.<br/>
Lullaby was working beautifully for him on the train of goblins they had<br/>
stopped (most of which was giving the lvl 27 experience)  So it may well<br/>
be true this is a song that stops working as well as you got up in levels.<br/>
<br/>
When I used it on aviaks that were red to me with the level 16 version of<br/>
my bard, it worked well enough as well.<br/>
