<b>Subject:</b> Bard workaround to binding in evil cities- will this work? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-792631828">Had an idea I wanted to run by you guys.  If it will work, its a possible<br/>
way for bards to get bound in evil cities and safely return to their corpse<br/>
if they die.  <br/>
<br/>
Step 1: Bard has two flutes in his inventory.  One is in a container and<br/>
another in a main inventory slot.<br/>
Step 2: Bard groups with someone who can bind and gets bound in an evil city<br/>
right next to the zone border.<br/>
Step 3: The bard and the person who bound him go into the next zone, i.e.<br/>
Innothule Swamp, Feerot, and duel right next to the zone border to the evil<br/>
city.  Bard lets the other person kill him in the duel.<br/>
Step 4: Bard reappears in evil city, goes to the zone where he is killed,<br/>
and loots everything from his corpse except the flute in the main inventory.<br/>
Bard sings invis song, using flute that was in a container, to get past<br/>
guards and goes adventuring.<br/>
Step 5: If bard dies while adventuring, he can then loot his corpse to get<br/>
the second flute, sing invis song, and safely get back to his corpse. <br/>
Step 6: Rinse and repeat Steps 1-3 to get another corpse with spare flute.<br/>
<br/>
I have never dueled anyone so am not certain how it works.  I assume you<br/>
appear at your bind point when you get killed in a duel.  I also assume your<br/>
corpse remains in place (duration based on your level) as long as there is<br/>
equipment still on it.  This procedure also assumes that the bard doesn&#39;t<br/>
get attacked and killed in the evil city while he is waiting to appear (i.e.<br/>
during LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  <br/>
