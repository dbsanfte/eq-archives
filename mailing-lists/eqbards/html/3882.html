<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934240575">Hey, I am a necro on the Rathe, just made 6th level last night, if you wanna<br/>
team up I won&#39;t ask you to tank.  I play a bard on another server, he&#39;s<br/>
currently 17th level, so I wanted to try another class.  So far Necro has<br/>
been the one I enjoyed, Bard is still the best tho.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you wanna team up after I gain a couple more levels, I will be<br/>
glad to play with you.<br/>

&gt; I must say that in 11 levels of playing the only time I wasn&#39;t forced to<br/>
&gt; tank was in a group last night the the group leader playes a 27th level<br/>
&gt; bard. Most of the time if I tell my group that i will just heal and buff<br/>
&gt; they will tell me to fight or leave the group.....so I fight.<br/>

&gt; &gt;      I would love to be a &#39;support&#39; Bard but there seems to be an<br/>
&gt; endemic<br/>
&gt; &gt;      shortage of tanks on my server.  I am always pressed into service<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;      tank.  Sigh.  And the couple of time I was in a group where it<br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; &gt;      have worked everyone in the group though I was &#39;slacking&#39; by not<br/>
&gt; &gt;      wanting to fight.&lt;snip&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; [re: successful leveling]<br/>
&gt; &gt; I advise all bards overly concerned with the best weapons and damage<br/>
&gt; dealt,<br/>
&gt; &gt; to review the gifts that you have been given. Nothing sickens me more<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; &gt; seeing a forceful party in danger, while the bard is selfishly fighting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; SHAME ON THAT BARD!&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
