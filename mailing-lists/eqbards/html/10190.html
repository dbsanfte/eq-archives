 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t understand where they&#39;re coming from. If they&#39;d<br/>
fix the AI so monsters wouldn&#39;t be hell-bent on killing you<br/>
from the other side of the zone forever and knowing exactly<br/>
where you are at all times, it wouldn&#39;t be one of the best<br/>
&quot;pulling&quot; methods.  The problem was the unrealistic<br/>
persistence of players on a mob&#39;s hate list (short of zoning<br/>
and memblur) coupled with the long time it takes to zone.<br/>
Given the all-or-nothing system the mob AI currently uses, of<br/>
course the players are going to grab onto anything that turns<br/>
the &quot;all&quot; into &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The real solution is a time-based hatred demotion system,<br/>
where a mob&#39;s hatred for you (as well as your kill-credit<br/>
potential) declines over time the mob is not being attacked.<br/>
Yes this would be difficult; but if you&#39;re going to fix<br/>
something, fix it right.  Unless the problem is very<br/>
detrimental to the game (which feign death wasn&#39;t), don&#39;t<br/>
waste time going from one broken state to another broken<br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
Bah, this is off topic anyway...<br/>
