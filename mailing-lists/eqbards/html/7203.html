&gt; Some groups have been able to take down the big mobs,<br/>

&gt; daggers, have the clerics buff them to heck, then let<br/>
&gt; them go at it.  I&#39;m not sure of this, but I have heard<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was in Sol B when about 50-60 people tried to kill Nagafen<br/>
this weekend.  Apparently he can basically insta-kill anyone,<br/>
so the strategy is to have the casters bind nearby and bombard<br/>
him with ice comet/pet/whatever.  When they&#39;re killed, they<br/>
come back, mem their spell, and cast it again before they&#39;re<br/>
killed again.  It&#39;s pointless to send in tanks because they&#39;ll<br/>
wind up in Freeport or Neriak when they&#39;re killed; that&#39;s 5-15<br/>
minutes until they&#39;re back in the fight as opposed to 30<br/>
seconds, and they&#39;re ineffective without their equipment<br/>
whereas spells are still fully potent.  So pets are the only<br/>
viable tanks when fighting these guys.  Really stupid.<br/>
<br/>
(Supposedly Nagafen was beefed up lately, as these guys were<br/>
at it for a couple hours, and had attritioned to about 25 by<br/>
the time they gave up and had a GM kill Nagy so they could<br/>
recover their bodies.  The recent pet nerf - bringing their<br/>
combat abilities in line with like-level player tanks - didn&#39;t<br/>
help either.  There were a lot of complaints that Verant<br/>
basically made it impossible to kill Nag or Vox since having<br/>
enough people to do the job means lagging the server to where <br/>
it&#39;s unplayable.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious though what would happen if you had about a dozen<br/>
L50 bards continuously Pixie Striking Nagafen to interrupt his<br/>
spells.  :-)<br/>
