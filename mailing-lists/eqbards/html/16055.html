&gt; &gt;Besides, it&#39;d be really really stupid if Verant coded it based<br/>
&gt; &gt;on primary weapon.  If that were so, you could put a mithril<br/>
&gt; &gt;quill (4/16) in your primary and a glowing pike (9/36) in your<br/>
&gt; &gt;secondary, and your secondary would act like a 9/16 weapon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The explanation at the time was that the speed of the offhand weapon wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; ameliorated by the check, meaning if the check said &quot;yes, dual wield&quot; that<br/>
&gt; because the offhand weapon wasn&#39;t cycled yet that it wouldn&#39;t swing. Just<br/>
&gt; goes to show how detailed wrong information can be *smile*. Thanks for<br/>
&gt; clearing that up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This explanation never made sense to me because it would mean<br/>
they *were* timing the swings of the offhand weapon, but<br/>
weren&#39;t using that to determine its swing rate.  If you&#39;re<br/>
going to put in a timer to determine if the offhand weapon<br/>
hasn&#39;t cycled yet, just use it to make it swing with the<br/>
proper delay.<br/>
