<br/>
A few observations. Would like a response<br/>
<br/>
+ Added stat and other bonuses to instruments<br/>
Where? None of my instrument stats changed for the better IE: Bonus? means<br/>
something added, right?<br/>
<br/>
+ Added more Class Specific Quests<br/>
Lambent. How about some more? Instruments and such. as it is, besides The<br/>
lambent, bards have some pretty poor quests. (4 I think)<br/>
<br/>
+ Added more Class Specific Items<br/>
Again, We have very few class specific items. I think they added a grand<br/>
total of 5<br/>
Look at warriors. They have millions;)<br/>
<br/>
+ Corrected Bug that let monsters attack you from far distances through your<br/>
pet<br/>
Didnt know this was an issue, since charm only lasts ten seconds<br/>
<br/>
+ Added Addition Effects to Some Bard Songs<br/>
Forgot to mention that Levitate will not work now. Would like to know what<br/>
effects were added<br/>
<br/>
+ Added New Bard Songs<br/>
New bard songs?, or do you mean, fixed ones that didn&#39;t work?<br/>
<br/>
+ Added Ability for Bards to Punch &#39;Magic Only&#39; Creatures<br/>
I thought I could always do this, with magic gloves<br/>
<br/>
+ Increased the Power of Some Bard Songs (c.f. Chant Series,<br/>
Fifil´┐¢s, etc.)<br/>
Hmm, I have not seen any &quot;Increase&quot; in power of bard songs, only a decrease<br/>
(IE Lullaby, Lament, Pixie strike, Selo&#39;s) Shouldn&#39;t there be a negative in<br/>
here?</div>
