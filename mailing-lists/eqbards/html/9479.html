<div id="ygrps-yiv-47432296">The player base on Fennin Ro is so large and getting to be so high level<br/>
that I rarely see Gix in his place any longer.  I look every time I go<br/>
through the zone.  Many people want to pay him back for deaths in their<br/>
teens.  Think I can take him at 29th?  I tried Dvinn at 25th or 26th and was<br/>
so stupid/cocky that I didn&#39;t even get bound.  Man did he smack me down.<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...  &quot;You have entered the Arena&quot;  Doh!  This is the<br/>
really odd part: A 43rd level Druid that I&#39;d helped the day before IN KERRA<br/>
ISLE of all places happened to see me die IN CRUSHBONE and gave me a<br/>
teleport back to my corpse.  Weird.<br/>
<br/>
John, what level is your bard now?  For that matter, what&#39;s your bard&#39;s name<br/>
and server??<br/>

&gt; bite the dust now.  I don&#39;t even bother looting them anymore.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;ve caused me more trouble than Dorn and Dvinn combined.<br/>
&gt; These two are so overpowered for their /con that I feel its a<br/>
&gt; duty to rid the zone of them if but for a short time.<br/>
