<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951011107">I am enormously happy for all the more experienced bards out there!  That<br/>
exultation is tempered only by my despair at ever seeing any of these quests<br/>
thru to completion.  At my current rate of progression I should be able to<br/>
take on the least of these tasks in about 2 years.  I gained 5 levels since<br/>
July.  Unfortunately there were all the same level.<br/>
<br/>
A question no one asked.  Where the heck do you get the Lambent stone you<br/>
have to turn in with the two gemstones?  At last a use for plat!<br/>

*** Bard-only Armor Quest! ***<br/>
by Liquidated  posted 10/7/99 4:11:29 AM<br/>
<br/>
I hit the temple of Solusk (er whatever) on the test server to check out the<br/>
<br/>
efreet and I heard someone complaining that a pack of bards attacked them. <br/>
WOOOOO<br/>
<br/>
There are now two bards in the main temple on the right if you enter from <br/>
the front.<br/>
<br/>
Walthin Firewaver - A half elf male in chain holding a horn.<br/>
<br/>
Cryssia Stardreamer - A Female woodelf in Chain holding a lute (wonder if <br/>
it&#39;s a magic lute....)<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that if you give various sundry items(the biggest being the <br/>
lute of the gyp princess) to the bards along with lambent gems you make from<br/>
<br/>
normal gems.... you get bard only armor. No clue on how it looks nor how the<br/>
<br/>
stats are.<br/>
<br/>
At bottom is the complete text so you do not have to run a bard over to find<br/>
<br/>
out what&#39;s up.<br/>
<br/>

Here is the complete text:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;hail Walthin Fireweaver&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;Good day to you. I am Walthin Fireweaver of the <br/>
League of Antonican Bards. My friend Cyrissa and I are here while we deal in<br/>
<br/>
[Lambent stones] with the followers of Solusek Ro. If you are interested, <br/>
Cyrissa and I also deal in [Lambent Armor] - the perfect armor for a Bard of<br/>
<br/>
standing. Also, remember to ask me later about a special Bardic Weapon...<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;What are lambent stones?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;Lambent Stones are gemstones of great power. They<br/>
<br/>
are midnight blue in color, and can be found on Hill Giants, Sand Giants and<br/>
<br/>
Griffons. If you want more information on them then you should ask Genni.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;who is genni?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Walthin Fireweaver judges you amiably -- what would you like your <br/>
tombstone to say?<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is lambent armor?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;Lambent Armor is custom crafted armor, made <br/>
especially for Bards. It is forged by the MeadowGreen brothers and then <br/>
Enchanted by the followers of Solusek Ro. If you are interested, I can tell <br/>
you about [Lambent Gauntlets], [Lambent Greaves] and [Lambent Boots]. <br/>
Cyrissa can tell you about other Lambent Armor.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what are lambent gauntlets&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;Lambent Gauntlets are exceptionally well made <br/>
gauntlets. If you are interested, I will give you a pair - but you will have<br/>
<br/>
to bring me the following items that I need for a trade with the followers <br/>
of Solusek Ro. I need Shin Gauntlets from a Froglok Shin Knight and Black <br/>
Silk Gloves from a Deathly Usher in Castle Mistmoore. You will also need to <br/>
talk to Genni about getting me a Lambent Star Ruby. Bring me these items and<br/>
<br/>
you will earn Lambent Gauntlets.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what are lambent greaves?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;There are no finer leggings for a Bard then <br/>
Lambent Greaves. Collect for me two lesser pair of greaves and I will give <br/>
you some. Bring me Icy Greaves from an Elite Goblin Guard in the Caverns of <br/>
Permafrost and Shin Greaves from a Shin Ghoul Knight, as well as a Lambent <br/>
Fire Opal and I will gift you a pair of Lambent Greaves.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what are lambent boots?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;Lambent Boots are the boots of choice for most <br/>
Bards. If you can bring me Firewalker Boots from a Solusek Mage and the <br/>
middle portion of the Rune of the One Eye from a Cyclops named Froon then I <br/>
will give you a pair of Lambent Boots. Oh - I almost forgot - I will need a <br/>
Lambent Sapphire as well.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;hail Cryssia Stardreamer&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Cryssia Stardreamer says &#39;Hail and good day to you. I am Cryissa <br/>
Stardreamer of the League of Antonican Bards. My colleague Walthin and I are<br/>
<br/>
here while we deal in [Lambent stones] with the followers of Solusek Ro. If <br/>
you are interested, my partner and I also deal in [Lambent Armor] - the <br/>
perfect armor for a Bard of note.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what are lambent stones?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Cryssia Stardreamer says &#39;Lambent Stones are gemstones of great power. <br/>
They are midnight blue in color, and can be found on Hill Giants, Sand <br/>
Giants and Griffons. If you want more information on them then you should <br/>
ask Genni.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;who is genni?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;where is genni?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is lambent armor?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Cryssia Stardreamer says &#39;Lambent Armor is custom crafted armor, made <br/>
especially for Bards. It is forged by the MeadowGreen brothers and then <br/>
Enchanted by the followers of Solusek Ro. If you are interested, I can tell <br/>
you about the [Lambent Helm], the [Lambent Breastplate], [Lambent Vambraces]<br/>
<br/>
or [Lambent Bracers]. My colleague Walthin can tell you about other Lambent <br/>
Armor.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is lambent helm?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Cryssia Stardreamer says &#39;I can give you a Lambent Helm, but you will need<br/>
<br/>
to fetch me a few items that I need for later trades with the followers of <br/>
Solusek Ro. I require an Opoline Helm from a Deepwater Goblin and a Mudwater<br/>
<br/>
Rune from a Lizard Fanatic of Cazic Thule. Finally, you will also need to <br/>
see Genni about getting me a Lambent Star Ruby. Bring me these items, and I <br/>
will give to you a Lambent Helm.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is lambent bracer?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Cryssia Stardreamer says &#39;Lambent Bracers are nice armor, and do not have <br/>
the same level of complexity that other Lambent Armor possesses. If you can <br/>
fetch for me a Dark Boned Bracelet from a Greater Dark Boned Skeleton, a <br/>
Griffenne Charm from a Griffenne and a Lambent Fire Opal then I will give <br/>
you a Lambent Bracer.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is lambent vambraces?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Cryssia Stardreamer says &#39;I will give you Lambent Vambraces if you can <br/>
acquire the following items for me - Fiery Vambraces from a Solusek Champion<br/>
<br/>
and the top portion of the Rune of the One Eye from a Cyclops named Choon. <br/>
You will also need to see Genni about getting me a Lambent Sapphire. Acquire<br/>
<br/>
these items for me and I will give you Lambent Vambraces.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is lambent breastplate?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Cryssia Stardreamer says &#39;Lambent Breastplates are not cheap, but I can <br/>
get you one if you bring me a few items that I need for later trades with <br/>
the followers of Solusek Ro. Bring me a Basalt Carapace from a Basalt <br/>
Gargoyle in the Caverns of Guk and a Gypsy Lute from the Castle of <br/>
Mistmoore. You will also need to see Genni about getting me a Lambent Ruby. <br/>
Collect these items for me, and I will give you a Lambent Breastplate.<br/>
Solusek Ro.<br/>
<br/>
*** I wander around looking for Genni whom I find on the right hand passage <br/>
across from the npc that wipes specialization.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;hail Genni&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni says &#39;I am Genni of the temple of Solusek Ro. I serve as custodian <br/>
of the [Lambent Stones].<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;What are lambent stones?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni says &#39;Lambent Stones are receptacles of power. Alone they are not <br/>
useful, but when combined with other gemstones they can be used for making <br/>
magic items. I know of [Star Ruby] Lambent, [Ruby] Lambent, [Sapphire] <br/>
Lambent and [Fire Opal] Lambent.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what ruby?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni says &#39;My Sister Vilissia holds the secrets to making Ruby Lambent <br/>
Stones. Though she will not speak of it, if you give her two rubies and a <br/>
Lambent Stone she will make you Ruby Lambent.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is sapphire?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni says &#39;My Brother Gardern holds the secret to making Sapphire Lambent<br/>
<br/>
Stones. Though he will not speak of it, if you give him two sapphires and a <br/>
Lambent Stone he will make you Sapphire Lambent.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is star ruby?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni says &#39;To make a Star Ruby Lambent Stone, you must give me two Star <br/>
Rubies and a Lambent Stone. Lambent Stones can be found on Hill Giants, Sand<br/>
<br/>
Giants and Griffons.<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;what is fire opal?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni says &#39;My Brother Ostorm holds the secret to making Fire Opal Lambent<br/>
<br/>
Stones. Though he will not speak of it, if you give him two fire opals and a<br/>
<br/>
Lambent Stone he will make you Fire Opal Lambent. If you are interested, I <br/>
can [sell] you a [fire opal].<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;I will buy a fire opal&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to <br/>
say?<br/>

say?<br/>
<br/>
* You say, &#39;can you sell me a fire opal?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni says &#39;I will sell you a fire opal for 550 golden coins. Remember - <br/>
