<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342906132">Well I&#39;m doing pretty good for weaps these days - and need some advice:<br/>
<br/>
I have the following:<br/>
Guardians Mace 1HB 14/24 Proc: Guard (24 or so Cleric AC Buff)<br/>
Symphonic Saber 1HS 11/23 CHA+10 Int+5 Symphonic Harmony<br/>
<br/>
Which should go in the primary and which in secondary?  The Mace has a<br/>
better Ratio - but I thought someone posted faster weap should be in<br/>
primary.  Also - the mace procs CONSTANTLY.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know if there&#39;s a message for the proc on the Saber?  I just got it<br/>
and haven&#39;t been able to tell.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly - I was previously using the Guardians in primary and a Sioniches<br/>
Partisan (Piercing 9/19 Cha+6 Int+2 Sv Magic+5) in my offhand - and don&#39;t<br/>
see any reason to hang on to it.  Any Xegony guys know what&#39;s worth and<br/>
anyone who may want to buy it?<br/>
