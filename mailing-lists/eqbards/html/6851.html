<div id="ygrps-yiv-580417640">I had Crookstinger a long time ago on E&#39;ci (and I believe a fellow bard on<br/>
this list is still using that same weapon:-).  I paid 25PP for it.  I would<br/>
say a fair price is anywhere between 15-35 PP.  Since you are on an<br/>
established server (Veeshan) I think you should be able to buy it for a<br/>
similar price.  No way it is worth more than that.  The stats you listed for<br/>
it are correct.  It uses Weak Poison.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; What is the going rate for crookstinger?  Someone was trying to get me to<br/>
&gt; purchase one for 300pp, which seemed excessive for something I wanted<br/>
&gt; mearly<br/>
&gt; as a novety item.  Can anyone confirm the stats to be 4 dam/21 delay/proc:<br/>
&gt; weak poison?  The seller was advertizing it to be proc: poison.  Big<br/>
&gt; difference there, but I still don&#39;t think it warrents 300 pp. :)<br/>
