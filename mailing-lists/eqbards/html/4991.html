<div id="ygrps-yiv-438673880"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I don&#39;t have much experience with NO DROP<br/>
&gt; items so not certain how this works.  If<br/>
&gt; someone has one can I buy it from them?<br/>
&gt; What if someone who can&#39;t equip it loots<br/>
&gt; it off the creature that drops it? Does<br/>
&gt; that mean it is forever unusable?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s my experience with the most annoying NO DROP setting..<br/>
<br/>
My wife was killed, gave me /consent to loot her body and I was unable to<br/>
loot 2 backpacks she was carrying because they had NO DROP items in them.<br/>
(Don&#39;t recall what they were at this time)<br/>
<br/>
A semi-newbie quest in Freeport to kill Lydl the Great results in being able<br/>
to pickup a book from his body that is NO DROP. My new wizard and a friend<br/>
kill him (I die in the process) and my friend loots the body so it doesn&#39;t<br/>
disappear while I make my way back. He&#39;s not a Wizard and can&#39;t complete the<br/>
quest. He also can&#39;t give me the book.<br/>
<br/>
The only solution around this, as was suggested by someone else on this<br/>
list, is to give the item to a mob and then kill the mob to loot the item.<br/>
You can give NO DROP items to NPC&#39;s because of the need to be able to do so<br/>
for quests.<br/>
<br/>
LORE items I understand, the NO DROP items have gotten a little carried<br/>
away. BurnedOut Lightstones for example. Why can&#39;t I give those away to<br/>
someone? They&#39;re not a quest, they&#39;re not valuable loot, what the hey?</div>
