<div id="ygrps-yiv-858770177">Perhaps he thinks since it&#39;s for other people&#39;s secondary characters that he&#39;s allowed to take it and sell it for himself or his own secondary characters. But if that were the case, then he should say that that is what he&#39;s doing and not just sneaking off and sell it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not only rude to you and your guildmates, but to anyone else outside of the guild that he plays with. It&#39;d make your guild look pretty bad if others are seeing this as well. And an officer?! Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty uptight myself on things like this. I&#39;m not a moral beacon by any means, but this is pretty bad.<br/>
<br/>
It would be best to talk to him personally about it. I&#39;d be careful about chatting with guildmates on this if your guild doesn&#39;t already have policies against behavior like this. I&#39;m sure he has lots of other friends in the guild as well. Lots of good guilds have fallen apart on much smaller issues.<br/>

&gt; Ooooh. If this mate was in my guild, he would have gotten booted the first<br/>
&gt; time. Just heard a major rant last night from our Guildleader about mates<br/>
&gt; not being civil to each other and anyone who wasn&#39;t would get booted, no<br/>
&gt; appeal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While it&#39;s just a game, you are still dealing with people and this person is<br/>
&gt; not honorable or honest at all. I&#39;d never group with them personally.<br/>
