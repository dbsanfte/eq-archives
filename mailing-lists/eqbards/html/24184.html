<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009492745">sorry was just using you as an example of someone other than me who thinks<br/>
bards are not underpowered in normal exp situations.  was directing these questions<br/>
to those who think the song should be pumped up so that more people would use it.<br/>

&gt;i never mentioned this song had anything to do with balance, or that i<br/>
&gt;wanted it to be helpful on an uber raid, just that i believe it is useless<br/>
&gt;and i will never mem it.<br/>
