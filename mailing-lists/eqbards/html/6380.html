&gt; Given, that it has been observed that songs gain power as you level past<br/>
&gt; them.  Do you think that using Largo&#39;s Binding will work better than Chain<br/>
&gt; on the stronger mobs u r fighting?  Better for slowing their attack speed I<br/>
&gt; mean.  Sometimes I have been using chain early on to get the slower atck<br/>
&gt; effect - but on them yeller and reds - I get loads of resists - or sometimes<br/>
&gt; no message at all? Plus - we all know that someone else should be snaring it<br/>
&gt; anywho. So think using the lower level song will be better chance of working<br/>
&gt; on the mobs?<br/>

area effect and one targeted, the area effect one is resisted<br/>
or broken out of more frequently.  This is true of CoD/DDD vs<br/>
Bellow/Curtailing, and Lullaby vs. Strike.  I haven&#39;t used<br/>
Binding in a long time so feel free to test it for yourself.<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re onto something.  :-)<br/>
