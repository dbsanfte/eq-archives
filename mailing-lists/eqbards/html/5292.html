*END OF SPOILER SPACE*<br/>
<br/>
Since the spoiler for the silvery axe is out, I might<br/>
as well finish it up for everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Elite HONOR Guards drop Silvery Axes (1H and 2H)<br/>
<br/>
High Priest Zaharn drops Zaharn&#39;s Coronet (what a <br/>
surprise!), which is a priest class helm that gives<br/>
Strength bonuses. Not all that good, but I believe <br/>
it is needed for a monk headband quest.<br/>
<br/>
Goblin Patriarch drops the frost totem which is <br/>
needed for the Crafted armor (boots) quest.<br/>
<br/>
King *something* drops the Symbol of Loyalty to Vox.<br/>
It&#39;s a bracer, AC 7 (same as plate), very light, some<br/>
bonuses to Save vs Cold, and wearable by ALL races and<br/>
class. However, if you do get one, give it to the monk<br/>
or all the other non plate-wearing classes first, it<br/>
makes the most sense. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will need a level 30 or higher group to clear the <br/>
room, once you clear it, you can hold the room with <br/>
just a high 20s group IMO. I&#39;m convinced that if you fight your way and<br/>
clear everything before the King<br/>
room, you can lure them out and nod them (so you are <br/>
out of range from the Ice Giants) and take them more<br/>
easily. However, the one time I tried that, something<br/>
went horribly wrong and it became a pull of 20 goblins<br/>
or so. It wasn&#39;t pretty. What normally happens is that<br/>
you invis pass the weaker gobs and pull the King room<br/>
straight. I don&#39;t like this method since one of my<br/>
party members always dies but that seems to be the <br/>
common strategy in there. <br/>
