&gt; I don&#39;t know about Lament and the fire giants (we had a monk pulling for us <br/>
&gt; the 2 times I did this), but Pixie Strike worked on the fire giants. Tenya <br/>
&gt; kept one giant out of the fight while we killed Skarlon. I had always heard <br/>

Pixie Strikes in a row, you can&#39;t mesmerize them (and yes I<br/>
was in melee range - it was standing practically on top of me<br/>
and doing a pretty good job beating me up).  Rokenn said that<br/>
he got it to work on FG wizards and priests.  So either FGs<br/>
are not immune, or some types of FGs (and possibly IG) are not<br/>
immune<br/>
