<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718359655">If there is one thing that can be said about multi-player, online gaming,<br/>
let me say this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If its can be done, it will get done!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Meaning if the program/server/host/front-end/whatever let&#39;s you do it,<br/>
someone will do it. No matter what.  It&#39;s the 10,000 monkeys at the<br/>
typewriter scenario - where one of them eventually pounds out the complete<br/>
works of William Shakespeare.  People like to &quot;try stuff&quot; and when they find<br/>
something &#39;cool&#39; they swear their friends to secrecy and show them. Then 3<br/>
days later everyone on the internet knows about it and does it too.<br/>
<br/>
So I think the &quot;owners&quot; of the game need to take responsibility.  It&#39;s their<br/>
game. They need to fix it.  But at the same time - they delivered a product<br/>
and they should stand behind it.  If some guy thought hmmm this would be a<br/>
cool thing, codes it, it passes internal testing, they pop a zone with it<br/>
and players loot it.  I think it should be theirs to keep.  <br/>
<br/>
If Brad comes along 6 months later and someone at a design review meeting<br/>
whines about so-and-so KS&#39;d some neat item and they decide the item is &quot;too<br/>
neat&quot; and implement a nerf - well that is gonna make everyone who got the<br/>
item before the so called powers that be changed the rules - MAD.<br/>
<br/>
They are dealing with a bunch of issues kinda like this now - the whole<br/>
feign death thing with Monks. After them watching 100k people play their<br/>
game - they decide they don&#39;t like how its being played? So they change it??<br/>
WTF??? <br/>
<br/>
They should concentrate on making the game MORE FUN - not more like some way<br/>
they think it should be.  Instead of taking away cool items - they should<br/>
add more cool items.  So they implement alchemy.  Good!  Now shamans have<br/>
something to do that is cool.  So the first potions they can make oughta be<br/>
worthwhile - not just more crap.  Why not a invis to unded potion?  Why not<br/>
a shrink your self? Or a SoW your self? Spread around some of these minor<br/>
powers - and while it may reduce your interaction with one class - it will<br/>
increase it with another.<br/>
<br/>
All this is just my HO - happy to agree to disagree with you - agreeably :-)<br/>
