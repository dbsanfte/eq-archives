 </span></blockquote>Lol. If more people are leaving EQ than joining it, why are we getting all<br/>
of these complaints of zones being too full? I make sure I do an &quot;/ooc Don&#39;t<br/>
you people know that this game is awful!&quot; in every zone I enter to see if I<br/>
can get some people to quit EQ. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant is doing a nice job removing exploits. They&#39;ve been trying to<br/>
track down cheaters and keep their &quot;customers&quot; from ruining the game, like<br/>
people did with Diablo.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing worse than hunting around in a dungeon with some friends and<br/>
having some person with a hacked up &quot;god&quot; mode come and in waste everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be more annoyed at Verant if they continued to allow an obvious exploit<br/>
like this. Granted, there could be a more elegant way of solving the problem<br/>
(as suggested by John Kim), but the simplest way to fix a problem (probably<br/>
just a minute data change) will probably also be the least likely to create<br/>
a bug in the process, which will probably cause some huge disruption to some<br/>
song that we (as bards) never use and will cause a huge uproar (how dare<br/>
they nerf our Disenchanting Melody! Don&#39;t they test this stuff!) and will<br/>
require numerous emails, tests, verifications, and quantifications of the<br/>
verifications from our resident experts to escalate the problem on the bug<br/>
boards to get it fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that last part went a little far, but you get the point. :-)<br/>
