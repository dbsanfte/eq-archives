<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025729107">Try crag spiders in Eastern Karana.  They flourish on the Hill Giant<br/>
mountain.  You can set up camp near the sign to High Hold (where the Paladin<br/>
stops) and lure to there.  Not great loot, but great experience.  Crag&#39;s are<br/>
about level 18 - 20, so bring a friend or 2.  : )<br/>
<br/>
Broon also spawns very close there, so be careful.... Or.... when you&#39;re a<br/>
little higher level (he&#39;s 23) with a little higher group, bring justice to<br/>
his ugly homer simpson looking skull.  :)  Seems we were the first on Xegony<br/>
to have this idea (yesterday) and I expect it to be sorely camped in the<br/>
near future... : /<br/>
(again horrible loot tho, so maybe not).  We did it with a Level 23<br/>
Magician, a Level 21 Magician, and a Level 20 Bard (me :)<br/>
