<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659625529">Hooray!  The King is dead!  Long Live The King!  (or should I be singing<br/>
&quot;the witch is dead, which old witch, the wicked witch...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Now, maybe some shit that &quot;can&#39;t be done&quot; will start getting done.  The new<br/>
guys breathed some much needed life into a dismal user interface in short<br/>
order.  Now, maybe some other much needed changes will happen too. The fact<br/>
that they are even discussing ways to increase exp gains - is a good thing -<br/>
a real good thing. I dont really care what &quot;GZ&quot; ever said in the past - they<br/>
all said lots of stuff and then turned around and did exactly the opposite<br/>
or were just flat out wrong...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These new epic quests have been thoroughly tested...&quot;<br/>
&quot;Kunark 50+ spells are dropping...&quot;<br/>
&quot;Bard mez spells are working right...&quot;<br/>
&quot;Selos should break root...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were wrong before - they will prolly be wrong again but at least we<br/>
dont have the old guys with what seemed like an ingrained predjudice against<br/>
any inference that what they just coded/designed might be not working<br/>
correctly.  Programmers have a very hard time finding errors in their own<br/>
code because they first need to believe that an error exists.  The old guy&#39;s<br/>
(plural - I am blanketly lumping GZ and the rest of &quot;them&quot; - whoever they<br/>
are toegther) attitude was a major factor in a lot of problems with the game<br/>
and Verant.<br/>

Just my humble opinions =)<br/>

GZ no longer works on EQ, he works on &#39;other MMORPG&#39;s&#39;.<br/>
