&gt;I&#39;m glad they fixed the tamborine, I guess my point was they could fix one<br/>
&gt;stick in a couple of months but it&#39;s taking over 2 years to fix the first<br/>
&gt;stick and they still make excuses? That ends to defy all logic to me. They<br/>
&gt;just seem to be hugely choosy about their priorities, not to preach to the<br/>
&gt;choir here. Let&#39;s start a trust fund to send them to Effective Management<br/>
&gt;training! Talk about 7 Habits of Highly Defective People, Dr. Covey would<br/>
&gt;have his hands full.<br/>

&gt;/em waves at Slyde. I hadn&#39;t seen you much either, but I only get playtime<br/>
&gt;on the weekends these days it seems and sometimes play my wizard. You did<br/>
&gt;drag my mage and shaman out the BW to kill that cleric quest guy last<br/>
&gt;weekend, Altoidus and Chubb. We were trying to talk them into joining us in<br/>
&gt;Sebilis. Gratz on the armor! I&#39;ve been trying to trade for the gloves but<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t had the right deal yet.<br/>

&gt;I think the helm art alone proves Verant has no fashion sense, let alone the<br/>
&gt;silly animations.<br/>

meeting with &quot;technical&quot; people hashing out problems. While you&#39;re at it, <br/>
give me a paper cut and pour lemon juice on it. :-)<br/>

Fashion is always in the eyes on the beholder (or whatever latest fashion <br/>
magazine is saying what fashion is). It would have been nice if we were <br/>
able to choose between 3 different styles of what our Plate Mail helm <br/>
looked like on us. Ah well.<br/>
