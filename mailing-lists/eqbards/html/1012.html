<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122767319">I went through HH once back when I was level 8 on my way from Qeynos to<br/>
Freeport for the first time and I got lucky enough to run into a room with 3<br/>
NPC&#39;s that I did not realize were hostile, 1 was a dwarf who mauled the hell<br/>
out of me before I knew what was going on, in fact, I was walking over to<br/>
them to ask directions! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Apparently there is a band of 3 brigands who are NPC&#39;s that are somewhere in<br/>
HH Pass and these must have been the characters I ran into.  Anyone have any<br/>
more info on these dubious creatures?  When I am high enough in level you<br/>
can bet that I am returning to exact my revenge on them!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay here&#39;s the on-topic part: I would like to know where <br/>
&gt; to get Tarew&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; Aquatic Eye. I heard from Highpass Hold ONLY?? Is that true? Thanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Information about where to get this song follows the spoiler<br/>
&gt; warning at the end.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I played around with this song last night.  It didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; matter whether I was using a flute or not.  Does anyone know<br/>
&gt; if there&#39;s a difference?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I found that:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Playing this song underwater let me breathe, but I still<br/>
&gt; lost stamina as if I were swimming.  I realize we have another<br/>
&gt; song just for stamina, but doesn&#39;t it seem rather silly that<br/>
&gt; we need to twist the two just to comfortably stay underwater?<br/>
&gt; Does the amount of stamina you lose decrease as you get higher<br/>
&gt; in level?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Playing the song on dry land, you lose stamina as if you<br/>
&gt; are swimming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) You cannot swim backwards.  Makes underwater combat a bit<br/>
&gt; tricky.<br/>

&gt; Yes, you can only get it in Highhold pass.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have to go into High Hold itself (another zone in HH<br/>
&gt; Pass).  Inside in the back are two libraries.  One has a man<br/>
&gt; selling wizard spells.  The other has a man selling bard<br/>
&gt; spells (named Justin Rhymes or something, ha ha).  There is a<br/>
&gt; bank in High Hold, so you don&#39;t have to risk any valuable<br/>
&gt; equipment and money on the trip over; although the place was<br/>
&gt; so camped when I went (the mobs there give no less than three<br/>
&gt; highly desired magic items) that I didn&#39;t even need<br/>
&gt; Accelerando and just walked in.  The layout of HH Pass is<br/>
&gt; rather confusing, and if you don&#39;t mind getting a map online,<br/>
&gt; I suggest you do so.  There are no 90 degree turns in the<br/>
&gt; place, and it&#39;s very easy to get disoriented.<br/>
