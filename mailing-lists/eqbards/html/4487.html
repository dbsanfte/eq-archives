The closer the mob is to your level, the greater the chance it<br/>
seems of it being able to &quot;break out&quot; of a song effect.  My<br/>
only real gripe about this is that it&#39;s possible for a mob to<br/>
immediately break out of an effect.  That doesn&#39;t make sense<br/>
to me because that&#39;s what the initial resist check is for.  <br/>
If it didn&#39;t resist, then it should suffer the effect for at<br/>
least one tick, not 0.1 seconds.<br/>
