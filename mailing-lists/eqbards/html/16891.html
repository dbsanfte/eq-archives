&gt; Heh.  Now that large portions of LGuk and SolB are green to<br/>
&gt; me, I&#39;ve found Screech to be pretty good for crowd<br/>
&gt; control.  When I start a train, I&#39;m routinely stopping at the<br/>
&gt; zone, warning everyone there that a train is coming, and<br/>
&gt; waiting until everyone gets out, all the while using Screech<br/>
&gt; to delay the inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, nowadays it&#39;s awesome ;)  But back when there were 2, 3... MAYBE 4<br/>
groups in lower guk, screech was a surefire way to clear the entire zone ;)<br/>
We tried real hard to avoid killing 15 or 20 people ;)  Dirge may not have<br/>
been the only way, but it was a good way.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, does anyone here use dirge?  I&#39;d like to find out if it really<br/>
lost it&#39;s taunt factor... used to be a pretty nasty taunter... if that is<br/>
gone I REALLY want to know why.<br/>
