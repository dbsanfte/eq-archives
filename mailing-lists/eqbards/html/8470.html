&gt; I can add that Greater Darkbones can be found in Unrest and upper 20&#39;s in<br/>
&gt; lvl.  I would also question Choon and Broon both being 30th lvl.  I know one<br/>
&gt; of them is a good several lvls above the other, but I forget which.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, odd.  Everyone is saying they&#39;re different levels, but I distinctly remember<br/>
them both conning white/black at 30.  Makes it tricky to charm them - with lag<br/>
and slow  updating health bars, I always seem to pick the loser and end up killing<br/>
the winner with just a couple of swings of my blades. :)<br/>

in DC. They might be hiding somewhere in the Ocean of Tears too.<br/>

the other day, yay!) From rumor, apparantly the non-named gypsies can  rarely<br/>
drop it, along with MMBs.<br/>
