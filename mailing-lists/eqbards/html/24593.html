<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032450827">As a 41 Bard I have successfully charmed Sentry Kale to do the Hammerfal<br/>
quest. The Charismatic Carrilion doesnt bring the giants anymore than<br/>
threateningly to dubious. However I&#39;ve noticed that only the giants that are<br/>
on Kromrif faction are still KOS to me. All the Kromzek are Amiable. I&#39;ve<br/>
fought in SS for quite a while and I still have yet to raise my Kromrif<br/>
faction. I think that one of the best ways to do this would be the Coldain<br/>
heads to the Kromrif Recruiter, or do the Mercenary supplies quest a couple<br/>
times.<br/>

  Kael is a tough zone.  As a 39 bard I&#39;ve found that charasmatic Carrilion<br/>
has limited effect for me and sneak is the way to go if your faction is low<br/>
and you need something.  The good quests are all in King Tormax&#39;s area and<br/>
you can&#39;t get thru there with invis song -- you may be able to sneak but one<br/>
of the &quot;features&quot; of Kael is that anyone dragging a body is KOS, regardless<br/>
of faction so plan for a difficult CR if things go badly.<br/>
  If you are going thru Kael using sonorous clouding, be sure to con giants<br/>
at regular intervals.  If any of them see thru the song, you are likely<br/>
close to the temple of Rallos Zek, a very bad place to be, even if you are<br/>
agnostic -- all bards are KOS there.<br/>

  Has anyone successfully charm/sneak/invis their way in to some Kael or SS<br/>
  armor? I&#39;m thinking of trying the Iceshackles and Dragon Tooth quests even<br/>
  though I&#39;m KOS and would love some experienced advice - and hope that<br/>
  someday I can get the SS armor if I get the gems.<br/>
