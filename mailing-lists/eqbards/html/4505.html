&gt;think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem with this.<br/>
&gt;Many of their spells at higher levels are just improved versions of<br/>
&gt;spells they had at lower levels.  They don&#39;t really have to worry about<br/>
&gt;memorizing their low level spells once they reach a certain point.  That<br/>

already had problems deciding on what to memorize - and now having just<br/>
gotten 12th (but none of the spells - too poor), he&#39;s gonna be hard-pressed<br/>
to make his decision.  As it is, he&#39;s already juggling spell slots (3<br/>
buffs, 2 slots), and he can never decide whether invisibility or gate is<br/>
more important.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this is part of the beauty of the Bard.  Each Bard makes his or her own<br/>
choices on what to memorize.  Like our choices of weapons and armour, at<br/>
early levels we might all choose similar things, but as we advance in<br/>
levels our choices will often diverge, leaving us more individual.  I, too,<br/>
often wish I had a few extra slots, but then I realize that instead of<br/>
depending on my songs to bail me out, the limitations force me to examine<br/>
my strategies a lot more.<br/>
