<div id="ygrps-yiv-167710077">Only a few days ago, I (33 bard) grouped with a L50 Mage and got xp - we<br/>
camped the WK Ogres and the Chief, the Sha&#39;s, the doggy (I think he was<br/>
still blue) gave me the &quot;you gained party experience&quot; message.  Granted,<br/>
this is not bub moving experience but he was there to get some loots for his<br/>
guildies and I was there to chat with him. And nobody else was around.  If a<br/>
treeant falls in the woods when nobody is there to hear it, it that called<br/>
farming?<br/>
<br/>
So, your theory is prolly sound but the upper end delta is not 16.  And<br/>
there is another factor involved and that is the con of the mob.  Grouped<br/>
with a L50 Mage and L48 Necro, we killed Zazamoukh - the named sphinx in<br/>
Rathe Mts.  In this group, I did not get the exp message - because the mob<br/>
was above the anti-xp twink cap (ie too high for me to get any xp from.)<br/>
Mobs can be too low for xp and they can be too high for xp as well.  We see<br/>
this if we have a young ranger or sha with us when we take on HG&#39;s. The mob<br/>
is just too red to get xp - not the level spread in the party is too great.<br/>
