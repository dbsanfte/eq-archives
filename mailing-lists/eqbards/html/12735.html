<div id="ygrps-yiv-115735414"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think out of all the classes that really are screwed up, Rogues would get<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I wasn&#39;t so much saying that we need attention in a fixing sense,<br/>
  so much as attention in the &quot;now what did we break with bards&quot;<br/>
  sense.  Most changes in the game to other classes usually turn <br/>
  around and bite us in the tush, due to lack of testing.  And it&#39;s<br/>
  always a surprise to the coders, and completely unintentional - <br/>
  which makes me wonder how familiar they are with their own design<br/>
  and/or whether they have patched it up so bad that it is a mess now.<br/>
 <br/>
  It obviously, never crossed the minds of the programmers/designers/<br/>
  testers internally that fixing levitate on casters would eventually<br/>
  &#39;fix&#39; levitate on bards.  Nor did they realize it with SoW/Selos.<br/>
<br/>
  I am not pronouncing radical change, I&#39;d just like someone over<br/>
  there to sit down and think very carefully for a second whether <br/>
  or not Bards get the skill they are about the change.  This <br/>
  clearly is not happening during internal testing.  And there&#39;s<br/>
  no one to blame but Verant for this.<br/>
<br/>
  If only my girlfriend would let me move to San Digeo.  I have<br/>
  all the background they need for another mud game coder. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
