<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151307611">Actually due t the ridiculous deinflation of prices since nothing ever<br/>
breaks my bard could easily afford a glowing crook staff and did have one<br/>
briefly before I sold it to our group druid.  aslo, since I doubt I will<br/>
reach level 25 before 1 year of RL playing time to tell me my class has to<br/>
be weaker than everyone else&#39;s for that long is pretty lame.<br/>

&gt; I had higher dex and agility which seemed to matter, but not enough <br/>

&gt; due to far better ac, but a glowing crook staff would rapidly even <br/>
&gt; things out as we have no equivalent melee weapon below the 30+ <br/>
&gt; levels.  That staff rocks!  Too bad we have a max skill of 1 in 2HS <br/>
&gt; and 2HB.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the main problem is that your duels took place at lvl 16.  Before<br/>
level 20, many of the classes look exactly the same melee wise.  Sorry, but<br/>
a duel at lvl 16 is not an accurate judge of the abilities between 2<br/>
classes.  Before level 16 the combat is equipment based, the glowing wooden<br/>
crook (found on a level 24 or 25 lockjaw) is slightly above the level of the<br/>
person you&#39;re fighting.  Level 16 is very young in a character&#39;s career.  To<br/>
be honest, I would say that only aound level 25, when a character has had a<br/>
decent chance to equip themselves and they have most of the skills that<br/>
their class will get do you get truly defining battles between classes.<br/>
Once you get dual wield, you will smoke a cleric in melee hands down.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have only dueled a ranger in ranged combat only.  No contest he <br/>
&gt; smoked me taking only 2 bubbles of health.  Of course he did use a <br/>
&gt; bow which we cannot use.  Main problem was we were 16th at the time <br/>
&gt; and he could camo and I could not.  He knew when he was in range, I <br/>
&gt; did not.  He knew which way to run to get in range, I did not.  I am<br/>
&gt; sure I could beat either if we used only spells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ranged combat only between a bow wielding class and a non bow wielding class<br/>
seems to me like it&#39;s always going to be pretty one-sided.<br/>
