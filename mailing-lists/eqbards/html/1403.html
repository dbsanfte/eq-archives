<br/>
Autoattack is &#39;0&#39; on the numpad, /consider is &#39;.&#39; on the numpad.<br/>
<br/>
Bank 1:<br/>
B1: Arms/Warsong<br/>
B2: Bellow<br/>
B3: Healing<br/>
B4: Lullaby<br/>
B5: Run (I think it&#39;s kinda thoughtless that we default to walk upon <br/>
disconning)<br/>
B6: Sit/Stand<br/>
<br/>
Bank 2:<br/>
B1: Locate corpse/underwater breathing/Discord<br/>
B2: Accelerando<br/>
B3: Guardian Rhythms<br/>
B4: Lament<br/>
B5: Sense-Heading<br/>
B6: Sit/Stand<br/>
<br/>
Bank 3:<br/>
Button 1: Sneak<br/>
Button 2: Assist<br/>
Button 3: Corpse<br/>
Button 4: Forage<br/>
<br/>
Still haven&#39;t worked out how to drop inv. slots into the hot-keys and I <br/>
can&#39;t be bothered doing the <br/>
friends/invite/disband/smile/gurgle/fart/smooch/etc miscellaneous crud. I <br/>
should work on hot-keying more though. And to that fellow who clicks his <br/>
spells.... wow! My finger would be arthritic and disgustingly muscular if I <br/>
did that. Maybe you&#39;re a leftie... that&#39;d make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Quick question: Someone mentioned the named fellow in highpass spawns <br/>
regularly... what times may this be, if you please? I really want me one of <br/>
those Tomahwaks but I&#39;ve spent so much time just sitting around watching <br/>
tons of very organized people take care of that chunk of the zone that I <br/>
feel I need to resort to more inquisitive methods. Nobody there&#39;s willing <br/>
to join me in conversation.<br/>
As an aside: Don&#39;t you think it odd that so many gnolls spawn right near <br/>
where a captain hangs out and around the corner from a bustling city? Sort <br/>
of like coyotes in NYC.<br/>
