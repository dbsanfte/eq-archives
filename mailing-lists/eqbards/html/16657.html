<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083240014">I am not going to be in a regular group for a while, so I thought I would<br/>
make a little &quot;Bard Primer&quot; for when I join pick-up groups.<br/>
Despite my flailings about here lately *smile* once in a group and having<br/>
picked my songs I am seriously on task and (BION) focused. So here is the<br/>
first pass, some of these may be more strongly worded than the reality, but<br/>
they need to be brief and communicate teh concept. The hardest part is that<br/>
they have to all fit in a Social or three. I would love to hear<br/>
suggestions(remember it has to fit in a single line (at most two) of a<br/>
social which is somewhere around 48 characters:<br/>
<br/>
I am extremely focused on the collective survival<br/>
that being said there are some realities:<br/>
Heal+DoT=MegaTaunt.I only sing heal in combat<br/>
if few mobs/great taunter or I can save a life<br/>
Outdoors I am your fastest/safest ticket to zone<br/>
<br/>
I am a mob magnet, I need the healers attention<br/>
If healer burns I will spend half my time zoning<br/>
Announce root/mezz of mob,songs can break them<br/>
Selo&#39;s does not break SoW, jig does not speed med<br/>
I get the mana song in 6 levels :o)<br/>
<br/>
So I am not remembering how many slots a social has, but the last two are<br/>
optional. Any suggestions? I mostly hunted with a small, good group, so<br/>
there may be some things I have never had to address specifically.<br/>
<br/>
