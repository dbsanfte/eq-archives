&gt; recalled that I was able to charm a Spectre not to<br/>
&gt; long ago (with lots of <br/>
&gt; resists, but I was successful).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone successfully broken the camp solo? The<br/>
&gt; Spectres are so slow and <br/>
&gt; we can run over the water pretty easily, figured<br/>
&gt; someone must have done this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did a little test and charmed one , but watched my<br/>
&gt; &quot;pet&quot; go running off <br/>
&gt; in the direction of the gypsies. I turned and zoned<br/>
&gt; when I saw his 3 <br/>
&gt; buddies come floating my direction, as I didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; any innocents killed <br/>
&gt; while I&#39;m just messing around. I thought it was<br/>
&gt; strange that my charmed <br/>
&gt; Spectre didn&#39;t just come to me. I was heading to guk<br/>
&gt; so I didn&#39;t stay <br/>
&gt; around to fiddle with this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lamenting didn&#39;t seem to be the simple answer as I<br/>
&gt; doubt I&#39;d be able to <br/>
&gt; keep the levitation up long enough to lament 2 of<br/>
&gt; them and pull the other 2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, soloing hill giants/cyclopses are probably<br/>
&gt; easier, but this one is <br/>
&gt; just a little cooler.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I may try again some late night when there aren&#39;t as<br/>
&gt; many gator killers <br/>
&gt; around. The only other spots I know where there are<br/>
&gt; Spectres are the undead <br/>
&gt; island in OOT (not a great place to test this stuff<br/>
&gt; out at) and Feerott <br/>
&gt; (which I don&#39;t have a lot of experience at).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But any suggestions would be very welcome!<br/>
