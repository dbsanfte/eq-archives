<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556423604">I run W2K and it is great :) not only do I have great performance from<br/>
the game, but I have a great platform to work from when not gaming that<br/>
is solid as a rock.  (Note:  I am a &quot;little&quot; biased)<br/>
<br/>
Btw:  I too had lots of problems with Windows ME as an upgrade to an<br/>
older box.  (that box I updated to W2K Server and it runs great)  I<br/>
received ME on a new box and have never had a single problem with it.<br/>

I have to agree with Atonal. Stay as far away from ME as you can.  A<br/>
friend<br/>
convinced me to install it on my machine and not 3 weeks later, I was<br/>
getting weird dll errors and it would not shut down properly.  My friend<br/>
had<br/>
the same problems on his machine.  I have heard that a service pack is<br/>
required if you install ME and I didn&#39;t do that since I didn&#39;t know at<br/>
the<br/>
time.  So I am back to W98 and running fine.  I am interested in<br/>
anyone&#39;s<br/>
opinion of Win2K and gaming.<br/>
<br/>
For the record I am running:<br/>
PIII 450<br/>
256 Meg Ram<br/>
10 Gig HD<br/>
Viper770 Video card w/16M of memory (wouldn&#39;t mind upgrading this<br/>
eventually<br/>
but it runs great)<br/>

I would recommend that, under no circumstance, &quot;upgrade&quot; to ME!!  I have<br/>
heard more bad than good about it.  Your best bet, for a gaming machine,<br/>
is<br/>
Windows98 Second Edition.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine bought a new machine with ME on it.  It was plagued<br/>
with<br/>
random, unexplained blue screens and other crashes.  He reformatted with<br/>
Win98SE over a month ago, and has not had one single blue screen or<br/>
random<br/>
crash since then.<br/>
