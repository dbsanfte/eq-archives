<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578662155">I would not go to seb or chardok before 51 for sure...  But karnors stuff<br/>
starts getting blue at 43-44, 45 is fine, I actually went in now and then at<br/>
40.  mind you at 45 when i was there i got my partisan from a moat group.<br/>
All my SS was given to me by friends, i have yet to see any drop.  Live<br/>
captain is a fun fun camp, fast paced and great xp.  Got a blackjack<br/>
(raising 1hb slowly now and then)<br/>
<br/>
Hell the way i look at it, if i can by chance win a jade mace in cap group,<br/>
it will be well worth going to karnors. I have to get rid of that damn yak<br/>

Karnors is fine for lvl 45+ I think.  Moat groups especially.<br/>
The others I agree on, never been to Sebellis, but I went to Chardok at 49<br/>
at 50 and if I agroed a caster, I would die before the cleric could get a<br/>
spell off.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Man, you died fast.&quot;<br/>
