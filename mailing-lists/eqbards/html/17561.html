<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510459243">I was in Hate last night.  The Maestro was dual-wielding<br/>
Evensongs.  We almost got him the first time (down to &#39;Mae&#39;),<br/>
but then he started flying around attacking nukers, and<br/>
clerics who had sat down to med.  The melee folks couldn&#39;t<br/>
keep in range, and he actually lifetapped back up to &#39;Maest&#39;<br/>
as we died.  The second time I went LD just as the fight<br/>
started, and when I got back there were only 5 tanks left<br/>
standing with him at &#39;Maes&#39;.  Our damage wasn&#39;t enough to<br/>
overcome his lifetap and again he was gaining hp.  It was<br/>
almost 5 am at this point so we called it a night.<br/>
<br/>
Quad attacks for 150-250 hurt.  A couple tanks died within<br/>
3 seconds of getting him aggroed on them.  Combined with his<br/>
AE lifetap and buggy pathing, he was actually harder than<br/>
Innoruuk (who is widely regarded as the most difficult<br/>
god/dragon at the moment).<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve liked to have seen how Valoran (Rokenn&#39;s guild)<br/>
would do against him in this configuration.  Unfortunately,<br/>
there was a server reboot today.  Hopefully that will fix some<br/>
of the pathing and pet problems (we died to a pet train in<br/>
between the Maestro attempts).<br/>
<br/>
Dual wielding Evensongs...  Talk about too much of a good<br/>
thing...<br/>
