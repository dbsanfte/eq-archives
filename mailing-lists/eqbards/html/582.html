<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hit 38, looking at 39 shortly and no sign of those 2 songs yet :) -- or 43 <br/>
&gt; and above for that matter. Just wanted to know if there was an ETA on <br/>
&gt; those yet. Last question concerns magic effects and bard songs - is there <br/>
&gt; any ETA on a fix for that as well? I just got the XXXX from the XXXXX <br/>
&gt; in XXXX (great that you have to wear it now in order to use it - not sure <br/>
&gt; why it&#39;s setup as non trade, sell or drop since it&#39;s bard/rogue only) and <br/>
&gt; noticed it does the same as random cast weapons - sticks to a song if XXXX <br/>
&gt; effect ends while playing. Thanks! Rid <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The higher level songs are in - just not as easy to find. I&#39;ll probably end up putting some of them on vendors. <br/>
<br/>
As for the spell effect, not sure. I know that is on our list - i&#39;ll put a little more pressure on the programmer assigned to it. <br/>
