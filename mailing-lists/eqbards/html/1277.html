<b>Subject:</b> h2h skill cap 40 for lvl 12 HEF bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915102478">I level 12 HEF - skill level is &quot;bad&quot;, guildmaster(s) says &quot;trained to the<br/>
max limit&quot; - does that mean that hand to hand skill caps at 40? Or is it<br/>
graduated level cap, where at higher levels the cap will rise unlike the LVL<br/>
* 5 + 5 formula that seems to work for sense heading, swimming, 1H slashing,<br/>
etc ...<br/>
 <br/>
If 40 is skill cap then I am extremely disappointed because that means that<br/>
I won&#39;t ever be able to be instrument wielding bard in combat ... if true,<br/>
is it also true for human bard? I wish I would have access to this type of<br/>
game documentation instead it&#39;s holed up inside some Verant programmer&#39;s<br/>
skull ...<br/>
 <br/>
And weapons is another story ... is 1H slashing capped at some point? What<br/>
is best bard weapon ... I spent 10 practices in piercing and got giant snake<br/>
fang but did I just waste practices?<br/>
 <br/>

 Naum<br/>
