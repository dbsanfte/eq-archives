<div id="ygrps-yiv-31772714">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about to start my first bard character and I was wondering what<br/>
recommendations people had for how to assign the ability points during<br/>
character creation. What attributes are important? How much to each?<br/>
<br/>
Since they are part fighter, strength sounds like it could use some. Maybe<br/>
some stamina. Their songs, what would that be? Intelligence?<br/>
<br/>
Do you really need much charisma? seems like you could use one of your<br/>
songs to enhance your charisma when necessary<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
