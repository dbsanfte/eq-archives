<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-675719380">i was curious.  i have been thinking more about this lately.  do all the<br/>
pure caster classes have their casting skills (e.g. evocation) max out at<br/>
255?  along these lines, what skill caps do the priests (shaman, cleric,<br/>
druid) and hybrids (ranger, shadow knight, paladin) have?  i am almost<br/>
positive the pure casters max at 255, but i am not sure on the other casting<br/>
classes.  and in our petition, was anything mentioned about our four song<br/>
skills capping at 255 instead of 200?  i can easily understand that they<br/>
should in fact cap at 200, was just wondering what everyone else thought,<br/>
and if it was mentioned.<br/>
