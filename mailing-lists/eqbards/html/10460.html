<div id="ygrps-yiv-148909525">The whole point and problem of this is the following:<br/>
<br/>
	For those who use bows, the bow is only used when they hit the &#39;Ranged<br/>
Attack&#39; button. When they are in Melee and doing an Autoattack the bow is<br/>
not being used. I think they can&#39;t even use the button when autoattacking.<br/>
So the Ranged slot is linked solely to a button that cannot be used in<br/>
combat.<br/>
<br/>
	To map this out for instruments how would it work? If we have an instrument<br/>
in the instrument slot and weapons in the melee slots do we use the weapons<br/>
in combat and automatically use the instruments when we are not fighting?<br/>
(hey!) Are the instruments enabled in combat? What if we have two weaps and<br/>
a lute equipped and we use ADM(lev 22) which requires a stringed instrument?<br/>
How about bonuses obtained from certain instruments like the increased<br/>
healing rate of the Seven Stringed Lute? What if the rumors of weapons that<br/>
grant instrument abilities come to be? Those super beneficial effects would<br/>
be rendered not so spectacular since I believe the biggest thing from all of<br/>
this is because we have to weapon switch. Also what is the difficulties in<br/>
dropping a new slot on the screen? Would it have the same impact as the<br/>
whole barbarian shield thing requiring a 10+meg download?<br/>
<br/>
	It is difficult to say since there is no other class that must have an item<br/>
in a certain slot to produce a constant effect. Sure you have the bows and<br/>
ranged attacks but that is a one-keypress-one-use sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
	Personally I thought the whole ranged slot was hokey to begin with. Just<br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense to be able to pull a bow out of your (select inventory<br/>
location), fire the bow almost immediately, and then start swinging.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Actually after typing this out, and assuming the graphic change wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
bad, I think this would work well (just ignore the above ramblings):<br/>
<br/>
	If we have an instrument in the instrument slot and weapons in the melee<br/>
slots we use the weapons in combat and automatically use the instruments<br/>
when we are not fighting.<br/>
<br/>
	We would still need to switch instruments though...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)I /feedback&#39;d this a while ago.  It just seems logical to me.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)If they make it easy for bow using people to switch between<br/>
8)bows and melee,<br/>
8)i think they should make it just as easy for us to switch<br/>
8)between melee and<br/>
8)instruments.<br/>

8)&gt; You are missin the point - there needs to be a slot for our<br/>
8)instruments -<br/>
