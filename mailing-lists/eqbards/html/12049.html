  I just thought you were healing in battle ;)<br/>
<br/>
  We need an analysis of Heal/Mana mix versus straight Mana with<br/>
  healers doing the Healing.  At higher levels it&#39;s not efficient<br/>
  enough to play Hymm on tanks who have up to 2000 hp.  With the<br/>
  pack regen spells, and word of health spells, it&#39;s definitely<br/>
  more efficient to go straight mana.  I&#39;m not sure about L35<br/>
  or less though.  I am the master of low downtime, but I&#39;m curious<br/>
  if around L35 it&#39;s better to twist both or play one.  I guess<br/>
  the all encompassing &#39;it depends&#39; rule applies here.  =)<br/>
