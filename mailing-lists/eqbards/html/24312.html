<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795374552">We went to Hate again yesterday evening. 3 groups of experienced players and<br/>
each group had a bard. Things went well. We had 2 chanters and one or the<br/>
other died a time or 2 but the other took care of the mobs til we got the<br/>
other rez&#39;ed back in. As chance would have it, we had a big pull, nothing<br/>
that we hadn&#39;t already done, but somehow we kept aquiring more mobs. One<br/>
chanter died, mine was still alive but struggling to cast under fire. I<br/>
started SoT&#39;ing things off of her but she died anyway. Both chanters are<br/>
down and a couple more mobs show up. Each bard picks a couple mobs and SoT&#39;s<br/>
start flying. We were able to keep everything pinned down til one by one the<br/>
mobs died. It Really helped that the shaman slowed all the mobs as quick as<br/>
possible. This kept me I know from getting pounded into mush on resists. The<br/>
groups made a point to keep things off the clerics and worked with the<br/>
bards. They picked targets, called them and all stayed on the same one.<br/>
No Maestro, no Inny and one bard bracer dropped. I got it by default but I<br/>
actually think my Kylong bracer is better, for me anyways.<br/>
