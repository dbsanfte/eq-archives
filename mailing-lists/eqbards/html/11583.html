<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279839066">I think the real reason that they changed the Guise is that the world was<br/>
filling up with pseudo-DEs.  It was getting kind of silly.<br/>

&gt; 		Ok, I play a Barbarian Shaman as well and I have a guise.<br/>
&gt; And I have to say here that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unfair that other races can<br/>
&gt; equip it.  Have you ever tried to zone from Guk or Sol B when there is a<br/>
&gt; Troll, Ogre or Barbarian in your way?  As a Shaman, I can shrink, but for<br/>
&gt; the others, being small was of HUGE importance in a dungeon... not to<br/>
&gt; mention the ultravision benefit.  Anyway, I&#39;m fine with the change, but<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think it was necessary.<br/>
