<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560145232">I heard about this event over guildsay, and, like you, I was pretty disappointed at the player reaction.<br/>
Sadly, several of these people were in my guild.  I don&#39;t know if any of you have ever played a<br/>
Roleplaying event at one of the face-to-face cons like GenCon or Origins, but I assure you that simply<br/>
claiming that you are &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;carefree&quot; and using this as an excuse to behave however you feel like is<br/>
not roleplaying.  It is not only important to understand your own character and motivation, it is critical<br/>
to understand the backstory and to place yourself into the appropriate context.  How the heck can a player<br/>
claim to be doing this if they are:  a) trying to see if they can Levitate Mayong, b) casting Whirl Til<br/>
you Hurl on Mayong, c) trying to trade things with Mayong, d) seeing if they can do backstab damage to<br/>
Mayong, e) oh, you get the point.  I was quite pleased when I heard them screaming that they&#39;d been<br/>
banished to Everfrost.  Served them right.<br/>

&gt; We got wind of this GM event that was gonna happen in Mistmoore so we headed<br/>
&gt; on over.  Sure enough, on the ramp near the zone was Lord Mistmoore (GM in<br/>
&gt; PC looked like male DE), Lord Garamont (sp? a NPC), &quot;a wounded elf&quot; (NPC),<br/>
&gt; and another NPC (if i recall correctly.) And they were trying to carry on<br/>
&gt; some role playing dialog and unfold some story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trying is about the best way to describe it.  It was happening amidst the<br/>
&gt; semi-normal MM zone stuff &quot;blahblah auctions, WTB Ykesha or SMR send tells&quot;)<br/>
&gt; and of course the crowd of on-lookers some of whom were determined to<br/>
&gt; disrupt.  Not too long into the event - like 10 minutes max, some jerk &quot;bind<br/>
&gt; pulls&quot; the castle (he binds at the zone next to the event, goes invis into<br/>
&gt; the castle, agros a bunch of stuff, gates back to his bind point, goes back<br/>
&gt; invis, and starts yelling &quot;TRAIN TO THE ZONE!&quot;  I guess he wanted to scare<br/>
&gt; everyone into leaving. Heh, he also forgot that once you agro, re-invising<br/>
&gt; is useless.  The train eventually caught up with him and smooshed him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The GM&#39;s started /kill-ing all the train crap and dutifully got back to<br/>
&gt; their tale.  Well, not too long into it, some other guy decides to attack<br/>
&gt; one of the &quot;quest&quot; NPC&#39;s.  &quot;Lord Mistmoore begins to cast a spell...&quot; and<br/>
&gt; the guy is summoned to Everfrost.  Then an enchanter decides to charm one of<br/>
&gt; the NPC characters and makes it say: &quot;My leader is Raloon!&quot;  Poof, he is<br/>
&gt; disconnected and dumped to his desktop.  Then some loose castle train npc<br/>
&gt; attacks a lev 50 wizard who was watching the event.  He casts an ice comet<br/>
&gt; and &quot;poof&quot; he is summoned to Tox forest.  While he is there, he sees another<br/>
&gt; player who was trying to harass the event, an oger, who was also summoned to<br/>
&gt; Tox.  Guess the GM&#39;s who summoned him forgot that Oger is KOS to the Erud<br/>
&gt; guards who are now death looping this guy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At that point, I left.  Do people want any &quot;role play&quot; in this game?  Do<br/>
&gt; they want GM events and dynamic quests? Do they want to learn the &quot;lore&quot; of<br/>
&gt; Norrath?  All I can say is that it sure seems like they (the playing & so<br/>
&gt; called paying customers) sure dont. If I were the GM/Guides who had to<br/>
&gt; endure that - I&#39;d be handing in my resegnation.  The players suck. Verant<br/>
&gt; sucks (for making them do this without the appropriate support and tools to<br/>
&gt; make it work.)  It really saddened me to see this debacle.<br/>
