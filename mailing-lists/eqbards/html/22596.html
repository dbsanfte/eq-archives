<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-721583691">If you have a good group of friends to travel with, we all fought in the <br/>
Swamp of No Hope in Kunark from our late teens to early 20&#39;s. There&#39;s an <br/>
iksar marauder camp over by the zone to Trakanon&#39;s Teeth as well as a <br/>
Froggie camp hidden down a corridor (up on the right hand ledge heading <br/>
towards the marauder camp). Just don&#39;t attack Dugroz as he&#39;s an almost <br/>
invincible NPC needed for the Howling Stones quest.<br/>
<br/>
The zone is real close in case anything goes wrong.<br/>
<br/>
When that started greening out, we started pulling froggies from near the <br/>
frog city, and when we got bored with that, we fought near where the Ton <br/>
Warrior for the enchanter&#39;s iksar illusion spell spawned (right around the <br/>
iksar bandit camp close to the Field of Bones zone).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great area because frequently we were the only ones in the zone. We <br/>
almost always (except for the Ton Warrior camp) had this place to ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Grats on 20!<br/>
