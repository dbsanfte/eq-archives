<div id="ygrps-yiv-824855234">Was fighting near zone in Karnor&#39;s and won a lotto for a Swarmcaller.  I&#39;m<br/>
wondering any suggestions for what I should trade for.  I&#39;m a very short way<br/>
from level 45 - Still have entirely Lambent and just bought a 2nd SSoY (for<br/>
5k - not a bad price on Xegony although perhaps I could have bargained it<br/>
down a bit more..)<br/>
<br/>
	I had someone offer me a Jade Mace for it - not sure if that&#39;s a fare trade<br/>
straight up (also I worked so hard to get dual Y2K I at least want to &quot;play&quot;<br/>
with them for a while!)<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks<br/>
