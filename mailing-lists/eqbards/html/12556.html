<b>Subject:</b> Lambent breastplate quest peculiarity <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-204039176">This is a funny little screwup I learned as a lad in Kelethin doing the <br/>
spider silk quest over and over.<br/>
<br/>
Every time you hand an item to the NPC, the NPC checks their inventory and <br/>
compares it with the list of things required to complete the quest.  If <br/>
there are fewer items in inventory than required to complete the quest, you <br/>
get the &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&quot; line.  When all the quest items <br/>
are in the NPCs inventory, the quest is completed and the inventory is <br/>
deleted.<br/>
<br/>
I discovered this quite by accident when I gave Sylia Windlehands 3 <br/>
spidersilks instead of the 4 she wanted and completed the quest.  Every <br/>
subsequent time I did it I would bring 4 or more silks and give them to her <br/>
one at a time - and quite frequently it took fewer than 4 to complete the <br/>
quest.<br/>
<br/>
My theory, then, is that someone somehow handed in a single quest item, <br/>
perhaps thinking the lambent quests should be done in stages.  You handed in <br/>
the other three, triggering the quest completion (receiving your <br/>
breastplate, congrats!!!), and also gave one &quot;extra&quot; component, thus <br/>
triggering the &quot;extra&quot; error message.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that some quests require all the items to be given at the same <br/>
time, though I don&#39;t test to see which - most quests I do these days cost a <br/>
fair amount of time and/or money, and I don&#39;t want to repeat them if I <br/>
happen to guess wrong.  So although I have tested this trick with spider <br/>
silk (and once, by accident, with honey jum) I can&#39;t guarantee it works with <br/>
all quests.  Caveat questor = )<br/>
