 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, I hear that.  I experience the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
  Eastern Time,<br/>
<br/>
  6:00pm : Home from work, get the women on the cooking, I fire up eq.<br/>
           Harmonic lets you all know he was ..ugh I cant do it, caps..<br/>
           just kidding!<br/>
<br/>
  6:15pm : Ooops, the login server is F&#39;d up once again.<br/>
<br/>
  6:30pm : What is all this lag?  Christ...  doh, 2,000 people on<br/>
           each server, go Verant!  Way to keep up with demand.<br/>
<br/>
  7:00pm : Camped in hateplane, now bumming for a group.<br/>
<br/>
  7:05pm - 11:00pm : /shout more scorn banshees damnit, what is this<br/>
                     their night off or something?<br/>
<br/>
  11:15pm : Weather comes on the news, girlfriend starts chanting,<br/>
            &#39;camp camp camp camp&#39;  One more pull hon, and I&#39;ll come<br/>
            to bed.<br/>
<br/>
   4:00am : Got to work in 4 hours, ugh.  No armor drops, one more<br/>
            pull... one more scorn banshee... please... falling asleep.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   That is how my nights are going recently.  Although I did finally<br/>
   get a Six note blade.  Five bards in the hateplane, yikes.  Lots<br/>
   of competition.<br/>
 <br/>
   Harm.</div>
