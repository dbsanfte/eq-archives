<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994883146">If thats the case, maybe they should nerf druids at the lower levels so you<br/>
won&#39;t notice a change when you get higher :)  Yeah thats what they should<br/>
do!  Let me ask you this...are the Fire Giant&#39;s green or blue to you?  Or<br/>
even white?  If they are white and above they are going to get resisted.  I<br/>
group with druids now and they get resisted 100% of the time against reds,<br/>
80% against yellow and 60% against whites.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, this is were the grouping aspects of EQ take over.  Yes we have<br/>
&gt; songs <br/>
&gt; &gt; that lower fire resist, also enchanters can lower resists as well (which<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; why my bard loves grouping with enchanters, but that is another thread <br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;grin&gt;).  This is not a solo&#39;ist game in the long run, esp if you want<br/>
&gt; to go <br/>
&gt; &gt; into the dungeon depths.  The thing with Druids and Necros is that they<br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; &gt; so easy to solo up to high levels (30+) that the people who play them do<br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; &gt; get a chance to build grouped tactics.  So it is not so much that they<br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult to play at higher levels, they are just suddenly forced to<br/>
&gt; group <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the 30&#39;s and it can ge a bit harsh making the change that late in the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s bull. Sure, it may be true for some people, but most druids I know<br/>
&gt; (including myself) are constant groupers. Grouping is where the fun is at.<br/>
&gt; However, it&#39;s not fun to be decent at some things (DD and heal) for 30<br/>
&gt; levels, then suddenly have half your ability taken away (DDs resisted) and<br/>
&gt; your other main ability fade away slowly (no heals above greater heal).<br/>
&gt; Yes, you can still be very useful. But no longer can you be, to a group,<br/>
&gt; what you&#39;ve been for 30 levels (a nuker or healer as needed). That&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; hard change to make -- especially when Verant keeps waving in your face<br/>
&gt; &quot;you&#39;re the second/third best nukers in the game!&quot; but decline to mention<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s IF you&#39;re not resisted. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kind of like how they go &quot;you have the best root in the game! it roots AND<br/>
&gt; does damage!&quot; Sure.. at level 30, that 10dmg with a root is really worth<br/>
&gt; the extra 40% resists..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, getting pretty off topic here.. =)<br/>
