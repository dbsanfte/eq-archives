<b>Subject:</b> instrument switching and inventory <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-272699734">When playing my new bard, I took a common suggestion I heard of making<br/>
hotkeys for the two melee slots and several (four) invetory slots. I have<br/>
bags/boxes in my other four slots.<br/>
<br/>
This makes it very easy to switch instruments/weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering, is there any trick to keeping those inventory slots open<br/>
(i.e. free of random loot) without manually having to put every item into<br/>
a bag? I bought a mandolin and horn to fill 2 more slots, but there&#39;s<br/>
still 1 empty slot (which needs to stay empty, so when I swap out 1<br/>
instrument, there&#39;s room for a shield + weapon). Anytime I look anything<br/>
it gets automatically dropped into that slot, which is very annoying when<br/>
trying to switch weapons later.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully there&#39;s some good tips out there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, =)<br/>
