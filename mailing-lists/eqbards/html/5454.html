<div id="ygrps-yiv-505279997">A copy of a post I have just made to Usenet for information (and a few<br/>
notes of sympathy and support for a poor bard losing all her stuff<br/>
would be appreciated ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The story begins ....<br/>
<br/>
Sunday night, after a reasonably successful day my wizard returns to<br/>
Freeport, does her bits and pieces in the city and then returns to the<br/>
West gate to camp for the night.  Roughly 8pm my time.<br/>
<br/>
Sometime earlier, my bard has already had a look out, and has camped<br/>
at about the same spot in West Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Monday night .... after a day at work, I return home to log in and<br/>
take out my frustrations on the orcs, goblins and other meanies of<br/>
Norrath.  I get to the character screen and decide to take the bard<br/>
out for a run.<br/>
<br/>
Strange.  The character model is naked except for the lute.  Oh well,<br/>
maybe it got corrupted somehow, so I select enter world.<br/>
<br/>
Strange.  I&#39;m standing at the counter in the Freeport bank.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
park here the last time.  Press inventory.<br/>
<br/>
Even stranger.  Where have all my armour and weapons gone?  &lt;insert<br/>
growing concern&gt;  Check the bank manager.<br/>
<br/>
Oh dear.  &lt;insert sinking feeling&gt;  Where has all my money gone?<br/>
<br/>
Immediately camp.  Check my other characters on the screen.  Wizard is<br/>
also naked.  Other 2 throwaway characters seem to be untouched.  So I<br/>
enter the world as my wizard.<br/>
<br/>
Same routine ... I don&#39;t remember camping at the same counter in the<br/>
Freeport bank.  Oh look, armour and equipment seems to have<br/>
disappeared.  And yes, so has all my money in the bank.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;insert a thump as I can&#39;t sink any lower&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And then I get to thinking.  Well, no one else has physical access to<br/>
my computer, let alone knowledge of my station ID or password.  My CD<br/>
is safely locked away, the account key long since forgotten or known<br/>
outside of this room.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly did not give away the equipment and money.  And especially<br/>
not on both my main characters.<br/>
<br/>
I think for a while and can&#39;t come up with any other reasonable<br/>
explanation ....my account has been accessed without my knowledge or<br/>
consent, and all my bits and pieces have been &quot;donated&quot; away to<br/>
persons unknown.<br/>
<br/>
At this stage, I phone Verant (or whoever).  Spend a good half hour in<br/>
a queue on the customer support only to be told I should have phoned<br/>
tech support. &lt;sigh - at least it&#39;s the same the world over&gt;  Phone<br/>
tech support .... I should petition and speak to the GM on the server.<br/>
Yes I already did the petition thing, no one was on.  So I was<br/>
provided with the Mith Marr administrator&#39;s email address, and<br/>
promptly sent an email off to him/her.  I also logged in, went round<br/>
killing the lowest of the low beasts in an attempt to recover some<br/>
money, and then eventually sat in W Freeport and waited.  But it is<br/>
time for me to log, and I shall have to seek a solution via email.<br/>
<br/>
This is simply an information sharing posting, to warn people that it<br/>
is possible for such things to happen.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, my<br/>
account was compromised, I can see no other explanation for it.  My<br/>
only hope is that the logs retained by the administrators will<br/>
demonstrate the time my account was accessed, the IP address used, and<br/>
hopefully the EQ account key used.  This will at least provide a trace<br/>
to the person responsible and &lt;fingers crossed&gt; remove them from the<br/>
game.  If I have lost my money and equipment, so be it, my life still<br/>
continues, perhaps somewhat disappointed, and certainly demotivated<br/>
for tonight at least.<br/>
<br/>
I would welcome any other reasonable suggestions that could explain<br/>
what has happened.  People lose equpiment and money to bugs quite a<br/>
bit, however having both characters standing at the counter in the<br/>
Freeport bank cannot be explained by a bug.  I am simply at a loss to<br/>
explain it in any other way than an unauthorised account use.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, throwing it open to the rather more well-informed crowd ......<br/>
