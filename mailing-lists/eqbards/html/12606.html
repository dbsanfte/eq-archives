&lt;&lt; As far as powerleveling is concerned, the best song that I found for doing<br/>
 so is Chains..  When I used lullaby, it didn&#39;t agro the mobs enough and they<br/>
 killed my newbie friends over and over.  When I finally leveled high enough<br/>
 to get chains, I found out this both agros better (I can cast once on sever<br/>
 creatures, and they&#39;ll pretty much stick on me) and I can keep them slow for<br/>
 when they run away.  :)<br/>

several levels above my wife (shaman). Like elite gob guards in runnyeye. I <br/>
just beat em down to a sliver of life, chain, charm, and when it moves again <br/>
she blasts the crap outa it. She went from 20-21 in bout and hour doing this. <br/>
But everyone has their own methods I suppose. <br/>
Happy singing.<br/>
