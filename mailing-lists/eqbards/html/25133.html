<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057518166">I was camping South Wing in Howling Stones last night and got a Guardians<br/>
Mace - 1HB 14/24 Procs Guard BRD PAL.  Kind of strange to have a proc on a<br/>
buff not a click - and would be nice if it affected whole party - not just<br/>
myself - but those are quibbles.  The 14/24 ratio is by far better than my<br/>
previous weapons - so I&#39;m thrilled I got it.<br/>
<br/>
We had a Paladin with us - who left less than 15 minutes before the weapon<br/>
dropped.  I was the only person not in my friend&#39;s (who invited me) guild<br/>
(CLAW) - and that made no difference to their comment &quot;We Always NBG&quot; (so<br/>
much for all the negative comments about people on Xegony...<br/>
<br/>
I previously was using a Blood Runed Short Sword (9/18 Piercing procs 11 hp<br/>
Lifetap) and a Sioniches Partisan in offhand.  I&#39;m sticking with the<br/>
Partisan - even though it has a slightly worse ratio (9/19) because of the<br/>
stat bonuses - always nice to have some extra CHA and MR especially when<br/>
mezzing...  Too bad the BRSS is no drop...<br/>
