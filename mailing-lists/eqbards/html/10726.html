magicians, enchanters, rogues that are extremely happy with their fully<br/>
suits of armour and robes. Course untill very recently i was the only bard<br/>
that went, and i already had a full suit from pre patch pof, but still<br/>
sucks. I need arms and bp for my backup set of armour still ;)<br/>
