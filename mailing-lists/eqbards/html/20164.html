&gt;quest was implemented properly.  Reports from the Test server last week<br/>
&gt;indicate it was broken on that server.<br/>

&gt;What were the problems with the other two quests listed below?  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;even aware that there was a mino horn quest.  Anyone got the details on it?<br/>
&gt;And isn&#39;t Travis Twostring the bard mailman in Nek Forest?  Its been so long<br/>
&gt;since I did any of the mail delivery quests that I can&#39;t remember with 100%<br/>
&gt;certainty exactly who Travis Twostring is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this referred to Ton Twostring *rotfl*  Go fig.  Anyway - we can <br/>
but hope for the best.<br/>
