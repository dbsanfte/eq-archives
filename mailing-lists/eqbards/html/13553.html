<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057577825">1.	I too will /feedback the surf-nerf every time I log on, which may<br/>
not be for much longer sadly.  Why is it they have time to &#39;fix&#39; an<br/>
animation no bard has ever requested be &#39;fixed&#39;, yet they can&#39;t be bothered<br/>
to do something every bard wants, to &#39;fix&#39; the stupid flute-drum?  IMPHO<br/>
Verant has done nothing but continue to perpetuate the image that this is<br/>
&#39;Their&#39; game and we should just be damn grateful they &#39;let&#39; us play it.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Great.  Now I can look forward to being a portable manastone.  Yay.<br/>

1. Boy do I hate the new animations!!! &quot;Grrr Bark Bark Grrr.  It&#39;s Verant&#39;s<br/>
like you that are an insult to all of Norrath!!!&quot;  One big reason I started<br/>
a bard was because of how great the &quot;surfing&quot; bard looked!  I thought that<br/>
was the way it was designed and not merely something they &quot;left out.&quot;  And I<br/>
feel that by now, like it or not, it became part of the bard &quot;persona&quot; and<br/>
they should put it back!  Ya, ya, I will endlessly /feedback this one.<br/>
<br/>
2. Looks like bards are gonna be in demand more and more.  Why?  MR/CR/HR<br/>
for dragons of course and now mana-bards in the planes.  Ya, ya, I been</div>
