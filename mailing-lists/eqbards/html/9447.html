<div id="ygrps-yiv-852758739">Well, E&#39;ci&#39;s version of the event got screwed up by some greedy high<br/>
leevls.  Most all of the good NPC&#39;s were killed and I don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone got rewarded except for those who got to loot the undead and<br/>
dark elves (read greedy high level bastards).  The high levels weren&#39;t<br/>
all bad, though, some would leave the loot if they couldn&#39;t use it and<br/>
broadcast to the zone where it was...so some greedy high level<br/>
(who probably couldn&#39;t use it) would come and pick it up.  Bitter?<br/>
Nah.  Actually I only died once in the whole thing, when I was blinded<br/>
by Innoruk&#39;s hate.  Friend of mine died at least 3 times and lost exp<br/>
everytime.  My guess for the portal is Kithicor or Nektulos forest.  I<br/>
doubt they&#39;d put a portal in a town, even if it is Neriak.  I just<br/>
wish I had something to show for my 3 hours of running around the<br/>
continent.<br/>
