<div id="ygrps-yiv-831511984"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I suspect that with the procs, the Yaks will even outdamage<br/>
&gt; our planar weapons.  But I completely agree that the procs<br/>
&gt; will make you the focus of the mob.  Even with a six-note and<br/>
&gt; Waki, I&#39;m often able to pull mobs off my taunting warrior<br/>
&gt; friends by sheer virtue of my songs alone.  Still, it might be<br/>
&gt; nice to swap in a Yak from time to time for those situations<br/>
&gt; where it seems you&#39;re never being attacked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This past week my wife&#39;s warrior finally got her first YK.  We were fighting<br/>
side by side in the Sol B King&#39;s room and I decided to give up one of my YKs<br/>
to her so that she could work on her 1HS duel wield which she hasn&#39;t done in<br/>
15 levels.  I&#39;d like to see the stats on a warrior with a Mithral 2-hander<br/>
(her 2HS) vs. 2 YKs.  It was simply a sight to behold.  Not stop swinging,<br/>
non-stop proc&#39;ing.  She was cutting down Kobolds like a hot knife through<br/>
butter and the taunt factor was so darn high there was practically nothing<br/>
anyone could do to get a MOBs attention.  The cleric loved that since it<br/>
meant really only one person to worry about healing :-)<br/>
<br/>
Hehe, looks like I&#39;m going back to my single YK and Kisch combo since I<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever see that second YK back!  Never realized how much less<br/>
damage we REALLY do in battle as compared to a warrior until I saw with my<br/>
own eyes the difference in her wielding 2 YKs vs. me wielding 2 YKs...<br/>
<br/>
Kinda a bit disappointing also.  We went on a Kedge Keep raid last night and<br/>
my role became weaving Guardian, Rhythms and Berserkers or Guardian, Rhythms<br/>
and Bubbles (fighting estrella after she dispelled everyones EB) with a drum<br/>
on the big mobs in the tank group.  They didn&#39;t even miss my relatively<br/>
insignificant damage and the heightened magic resist made a HUGE difference<br/>
against the swirlspine who couldn&#39;t spin a darn one in my group.  This after<br/>
3 dragon raids ( all failures so far :-( ) where I just stood under the<br/>
beast and weaved guardian and rhythms.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s my point?  Sure seems like my days of pretending to be a warrior and<br/>
swinging blades is quickly approaching the end as my role in the big fights<br/>
pretty much eliminates me from swinging a sword anyhow.  So, YK vs. Bladed<br/>
Thulian Claws really only applies if I&#39;m solo&#39;ing I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the bards role in the plains?  Resistance, Mana, Slow, Speed?  hehe,<br/>
I really do like swinging my swords!<br/>
