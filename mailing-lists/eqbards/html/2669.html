&gt; These songs are rendered basically useless in a group setting because of<br/>

without screwing up &quot;good&quot; song effects.  I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>
test it but it&#39;s been difficult.  I managed to play it once<br/>
when I got rooted last night, and it seemed to unroot me.  But<br/>
I can&#39;t be sure if it really unrooted me, or if root just<br/>
naturally expired at the same moment.<br/>

By the way, root cancels SoW.  If your party is running for<br/>
the zone and someone gets rooted, you&#39;re usually better off<br/>
hitting Accelerando to unroot him and give him back some speed<br/>
to get to the zone.  (For that matter, SoW cancels root.)<br/>
