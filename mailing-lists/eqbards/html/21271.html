Actually there are components of both depending on the spell.<br/>
<br/>
Some spells are inherently more or less resistable than others. An example<br/>
of this is the &quot;Fear&quot; series. The higher levels of the fear series are<br/>
inherently less resistable.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning caster level, it&#39;s not so much the casters level as it is the<br/>
casters level versus the level of the target. Resistance values receive a<br/>
modifier based on this difference.<br/>

<br/>
The testing is complete, the game designers and programmers have been<br/>
consulted, and results are in. I&#39;m afraid that the bards will not like those<br/>
results. We&#39;ll announce more later today.<br/>
