<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075688516">Thankfully I&#39;m not the only one to experience this!!  Thanks to<br/>
everyone who commented.  At the time this all happened I must have<br/>
been about 6 or 7, so I thought it was a good time to visit<br/>
BlackBurrow!  Little did I know ....<br/>
<br/>
It really did seem to be that no matter what anyone else was doing,<br/>
the nasty gnolls would ignore every other sitting/meditating/insulting<br/>
member of the group and head for me.<br/>
<br/>
And what made it worse was when I would stand and take some beatings,<br/>
and not do anything in return, it took an age for the other members of<br/>
the group to make the gnolls even notice they were there!!  Let the<br/>
wizard zap it I thought, but no that didn&#39;t seem to have an effect.<br/>
<br/>
So I died a couple of times through being stunned and overwhelmed by<br/>
the 5-6 big ones who decided to jump in and help their little friends.<br/>
Thankfully I&#39;m back on familiar home ground now and running around<br/>
Butcherblock teaching the gobbos a lesson.  Maybe when I&#39;m older I&#39;ll<br/>
resurrect the travelling spirit but for now I&#39;m safe(ish)!<br/>

&gt;I am going to have to back up our younger bardic friend.  There is most<br/>
&gt;definatly some bard aggro bugwhich can occur in seemingly any zone.  I have<br/>
&gt;personally experienced this super aggro in butcherblock, oasis, and unrest.<br/>
&gt;When I was in oasis, orcs were barelling over the dunes to find me, you can see<br/>
&gt;quite a ways in oasis so I would see several dark forms off in the distance<br/>
&gt;beelining for me and when they got close, hey 5-6 orcs all over. What joy!<br/>
&gt;Thank Erollisi for Selo&#39;s (the biggest lifesaver of them all)  This has happened<br/>
&gt;to me in those other zones as well... for no apparent reason, no group attacking<br/>
&gt;anything like you suggest, things come out f the woodworks and ignore the<br/>
&gt;medding nukers and beeline for the bard.  Its disgustingly insane, even when we<br/>
&gt;have to zone to clear the faction list.<br/>
&gt;*sigh*<br/>
&gt;JM, Care to comment?<br/>
