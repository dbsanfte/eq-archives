Ok, the coin is indeed found in the library area. The mob in question is a<br/>
Failed Crypt Raider. He drops the coin, an illegible cantrip (no drop lore)<br/>
a tattered scroll (lore and written in some language I have) and sometimes<br/>
he&#39;ll drop additional loot. The first time we took him down he also dropped<br/>
a spear of mortification. (dam 6, delay 23, effect: stun, shaman only). He<br/>
seems to be on a 40 min spawn cycle where the rest of the dungeon is on a 20<br/>
min spawn cycle, and he spawns just out back of the library.<br/>
<br/>
He was blue to me at 42, as were most of the mobs in this area, but they are<br/>
evenly spaced can be done in a group of 4 with no troubles. For those of us<br/>
who have evil friends, you only need watch out for the spiders at the<br/>
entrance area. None of the skeles or specs gave detrimental faction hits.<br/>
<br/>
I got 2 coins, so if anyone on trbiunal wants to trade the scorpoid coin,<br/>
let me know.<br/>
