<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t understand how someone making something that allows you to use<br/>
&gt; something that you already own - is stealing. Now if it allowed<br/>
&gt; you to play<br/>
&gt; EverQuest without owning a copy, I would understand. But I&#39;ve paid $50 for<br/>
&gt; this game and should be free to play it wherever/whenever I wish; with my<br/>
&gt; original CD of course.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When you purchase software you are paying for the manual, the physical copy<br/>
of the software and the LICENSE TO USE it.  As with most software, the owner<br/>
of the software (you don&#39;t own it, you&#39;ve only purchased the permission of<br/>
the writers to use it) may put terms and conditions on the acceptable use of<br/>
that software.  BTW, you&#39;ll find with most software that the license<br/>
agreement not only talks about acceptable uses of the software but also<br/>
states that the license is revokable, meaning should the company decide for<br/>
whatever reason that they would rather you not use it, they can revoke their<br/>
license and make your use of the software illegal.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, we all do own a physical copy of the game, but we only have a<br/>
limited license to use it.<br/>
