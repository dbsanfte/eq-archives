<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062578790">Actually Brad says this was done on purpose. In a newsgroup post, Brad<br/>
said &quot;Hell levels are common to many text MUDs, Everquest has them too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have heard different stories about the hell levels.  Supposedly Verant<br/>
&gt; &#39;accidentally put this code into the game?  And then decided to leave it<br/>
&gt; there as a feature?  Hard to believe.  Even harder to believe given Brad<br/>
&gt; McQuaid&#39;s past statements. One thing McQuaid has said..and I have probably<br/>
&gt; repeated here..is that he &quot;never said it would be an easy game&quot;.  Of the 3<br/>
&gt; major MMORPGs (EQ, UO, AC) Everquest is probably the most difficult and the<br/>
&gt; most unforgiving for player mistakes. </span></blockquote></div>
