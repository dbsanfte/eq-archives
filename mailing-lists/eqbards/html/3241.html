&gt;You know what?  I am very green to be so far from home, lol.  It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;blessing in some ways ... less to risk making the journey from Kelethin<br/>
&gt;to Rivervale ... if I died all I lost was my guild tunic -- and I gained<br/>
&gt;food back, lol.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Basically, the reason why I left Kelethin so early is because Quellious<br/>
&gt;is a very young server so all the pc&#39;s were hunting in Faydark.  I have<br/>
&gt;a crap computer (P200, 32mb RAM, 8mb StealthII) and with all the other<br/>
&gt;young pc&#39;s running around hunting my lag was waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy up.  I<br/>
&gt;spent the whole time running around after npc&#39;s that were no longer<br/>
&gt;there or that someone else had already started whacking at.  I&#39;d start<br/>
&gt;combat with something right in front of me and *pop* it&#39;d be 30 feet<br/>
&gt;away dying by someone else&#39;s hand -- you get the picture.  I was getting<br/>
&gt;ready to delete the character and make something in Qeynos (I never have<br/>
&gt;that problem there for some reason) when a friend was making the journey<br/>
&gt;to Freeport.  So I decided to go along for the run just for a change<br/>
&gt;from the frustration of swatting at &quot;ghosts&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once I was bound to Freeport, the server itself was having problems with<br/>
&gt;lag in the hunting grounds outside the west gate.  1000+ server side<br/>
&gt;lag.  Even one morning with only 400 ppl on Quellious in total, and only<br/>
&gt;maybe 20 ppl in West Freeport, I was still running at 600+ on the server<br/>
&gt;side (that&#39;s the number on the right side, correct?).  So, it was make<br/>
&gt;the run to Rivervale or scrap the char.  So, here I am in Rivervale.<br/>

&gt;I know this may seem like a silly question, but don&#39;t you think you&#39;re a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;little green to be so far from home just yet? It&#39;s fairly easy to hike<br/>
&gt;yourself up to level 5 in the Feydarks. Travel from Rivervale to Qeynos<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;VERY dangerous.....<br/>
