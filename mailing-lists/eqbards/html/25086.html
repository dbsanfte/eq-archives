<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262103973">I totally think you&#39;re right here... I also think that for pickup groups or<br/>
first time groups communication is key.  In my case, all but our tank were a<br/>
guild group. However, myself and another were alts playing with primes.  So<br/>
the chanter (prime chanter) did what he always did, and did not talk to me<br/>
at all, assuming I was interchangeable with one of our guilds uber-bards<br/>
(and I&#39;m not! lol).  In the end, if he would have even spoke up and<br/>
communicated it woudl have helped.<br/>
<br/>
But he did just waht you talked about, AE stunned then tried messing.<br/>
Didn&#39;t work lol!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; It takes a bit of coordination when a bard and enchanter are <br/>
&gt; in the same<br/>
&gt; group.  But if they work together and both know what the plan <br/>
&gt; is, it can<br/>
&gt; work great.  I have seen far too many enchanters commit <br/>
&gt; suicide because they<br/>
&gt; do not follow one simple rule:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Let the tanks - tank.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do believe that they panic when they see multiple mobs.  <br/>
&gt; Crowd control is<br/>
&gt; their job after all and things seem to be out of control.  <br/>
&gt; Then they get a<br/>
&gt; resist and a mobs turns on them. So, they AE stun.  Now even <br/>
&gt; if they mez the<br/>
&gt; mob that resisted, they have the other ones beating on them. <br/>
&gt; This situation<br/>
&gt; can go down hill fast.  I find that if they just wait and let <br/>
&gt; the tanks<br/>
&gt; tank, let the bard get one mezzed then they can pick another <br/>
&gt; one to put to<br/>
&gt; sleep.  Or, if they pick 1 mob to work on at a time. Attempt mez, if<br/>
&gt; resisted, back away from the group, let the bard mez the mob <br/>
&gt; attacking the<br/>
&gt; chanter.  Also, working with a shaman and/or cleric is great <br/>
&gt; too.  The sha<br/>
&gt; can slow and the cleric can stun.  In any case,  the most <br/>
&gt; important thing is<br/>
&gt; not not AE stun, work one mob at a time and let the tanks - <br/>
&gt; tank.  The bard<br/>
&gt; can do the first mez on a mob and then tank it while the ench <br/>
&gt; puts it to<br/>
&gt; sleep long term - but again - you need to coordinate this <br/>
&gt; plan ahead of<br/>
&gt; time.  And I have been here done this - as bard, chanter and <br/>
&gt; cleric - team<br/>
&gt; work, works great.<br/>
