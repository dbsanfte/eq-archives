<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775582576">My solution was disgustingly overly simple and general.  Part of the<br/>
design of the dungeon was to make the foo widgets interesting.  Perhaps<br/>
in Guk, they are pages of a tome which tell the story of why the Frogs<br/>
and trolls hate each other so much (ok that may not be too great) or<br/>
what happened in Lower Guk (IE why are all those undead there).  When<br/>
you finally get the &quot;container&quot; (the actual tome), you have achieved an<br/>
understanding of the Froglok people (and why they flip in combat) and<br/>
thus worthy of recieving the greatest treasuere of the Frogloks (a short<br/>
sword of foo fighting).<br/>
<br/>
It might also be me, but I dont really the &quot;rare drop&quot; concept.  If I do<br/>
the quest, I want the reward, I don&#39;t want to kill him 25 times to get<br/>
the reward. (I did the bullsmasher quest 48 times!, leveled 5<br/>
characters  Rare drops are just a way to keep people entertained while<br/>
doing the same darn thing over and over again.  Then again without them,<br/>
the world would have to be pretty darn massive since you would need alot<br/>
more zones.  We can all dream eh?<br/>

&gt;   Is that something like:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &#39;I&#39;d like to get ahold of *those* widgets&#39;<br/>
&gt;   &#39;Or, check out the widgets on *that* &lt;whistle&gt;&#39;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Everytime I hear the word widget, it brings back CS programming<br/>
&gt;   nightmares.  That and foo.  Like any other three letter vairable<br/>
&gt;   names, foo is used most often heh.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What widget do I get at foo level?<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
