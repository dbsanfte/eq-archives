&gt;&gt; &gt;Very strange indeed.  I may miss a note here and there, but not much.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;have absolutely no problem getting my songs started.  Can&#39;t remember<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;dexterity plays a bigger role in getting a song up and running, rather than<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;charisma.  If everyone else has good dexterity and experiences this problem<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I am mystified.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Dex of 106, and I have to try at LEAST 5 times to get Carrilon going.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The question is, how often have you played the Carrilon?  I have close to the<br/>
&gt;same dexterity as you, 110, and I never miss when starting the Carrilon, at <br/>
&gt;least<br/>
&gt;not lately.  I know when I first got the song, I used to miss quite a bit, but<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s like any song, the first while after you get it are murder for <br/>
&gt;getting it<br/>
&gt;going.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have used the Carrilon a LOT, between my smithing and buying steel plate and<br/>
&gt;getting oddball quests.  I think that&#39;s a factor that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m to the point now where I actually use it more than I use the Bellow -<br/>
if for no other reason than I&#39;ve been adventuring a lot this past week, and<br/>
wherever I go, I CCC the NPCs to keep m&#39;self alive.<br/>
