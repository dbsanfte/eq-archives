&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;  I have tried to figure out how to do this, and I&#39;m at a terrible loss. I<br/>
&gt;made hot keys for my melee slots, 1 and 2, and I made a hot key for an<br/>
&gt;inventory slot. When I try any of these hot keys, nothing happens. It would<br/>
&gt;make my life SO much easier if I could figure out how to do this. If someone<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t mind stepping through the process exactly how it should be done, I<br/>
&gt;would be eternally grateful. This is my first bard, and I&#39;m having a blast,<br/>
&gt;made lv10 this weekend!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay - one misconception, they aren&#39;t &quot;hotkeys&quot; at this point - they&#39;ve<br/>
become floating copies of your inventory slot.  The purpose is for those of<br/>
us using full screen, it saves on switching to the inventory screen.<br/>
picture this:<br/>
<br/>
A  B<br/>
C  D<br/>
<br/>
A and B represent Melee slots 1 and 2 respectively, C and D are two general<br/>
inventory slots.<br/>
We&#39;ll say you&#39;re armed with a sword and shield, and have a drum in slot D.<br/>
Slot C is empty (it has to be - you&#39;ll see why)<br/>
Grab Sword from A, drop it into C (practice this maneuver - you WILL<br/>
accidentally drop your expensive weapon at least once.)<br/>
Grab Shield from B, Drop into D (swapping with Drum). Place Drum into B.<br/>
Bingo - you&#39;re ready to Selo&#39;s off into the night.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
