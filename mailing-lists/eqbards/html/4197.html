<b>Subject:</b> Re: Getting a good item! and selling it <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464393268">I agree with this point of view too.  And I understand your point about to <br/>
sell or not to sell.  You have good reasons too.  I really like the reminder <br/>
about people&#39;s happiness after winning a lottery!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Absolutely.  Every life (real or virtual) is different.  Some<br/>
&gt;hit the dumps, some hit the jackpot.  I was merely warning the<br/>
&gt;owner of the crown that if he took the gilded road, he may<br/>
&gt;find that it didn&#39;t glitter quite as brightly as he&#39;d thought<br/>
&gt;it would.  Whether he takes my advice is up to him - maybe he<br/>
&gt;knows that the stuff I talked about doesn&#39;t matter to him, or<br/>
&gt;maybe it does matter and hadn&#39;t thought about it and my<br/>
&gt;advice saved him grief later on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will admit my original reply probably sounded condescending<br/>
&gt;towards powerlevelers (me being an explorer-type, if you speed<br/>
&gt;through the game, you&#39;re not learning many of the nuances that<br/>
&gt;give it depth).  But understand, I was only trying to make it<br/>
&gt;clear to him that he should think carefully before choosing<br/>
&gt;the &quot;easy&quot; route.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most lottery winners in real life are not happier than before<br/>
&gt;they won.  In fact, the happiest ones tend to be the ones who<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t change their lifestyle.  Sense of achievement,<br/>
&gt;contribution, and self-worth are what matters to most.<br/>
