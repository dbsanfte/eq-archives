<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857934526">I have Everlore book marked but think that the quality of their search<br/>
facility is below average.  When you search you get a bazillion hit of bits<br/>
and pieces and have to dig thru that to find the meat you want.  I would<br/>
hate to see your quality reference get that same treatment.<br/>
<br/>
So, I would say - keep things where they are. Working for free for your self<br/>
is one thing but to work for free for someone else (Everlore who wont host<br/>
your banners but get paid for their own) is something else entirely.  Kinda<br/>
like fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.<br/>

&gt; I was (asked? offered?) a place on EverLore.com for the EQ Glossary.  I&#39;ve<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it for me - I just need some unbiased input here - Do I take the Lady or<br/>
&gt; the Tiger?<br/>
