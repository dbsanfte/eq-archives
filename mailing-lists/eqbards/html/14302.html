<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513499732">I think the primary reason Verant started paying more attention to bards was<br/>
due to Rokenn&#39;s letter that he posted on the EQ board a few weeks back.  The<br/>
letter was in a proper tone (i.e. not a whine or rant) to illicit a response<br/>
from Verant.  The content of the letter was based off of months of research<br/>
and testing by bards on this list and the Concert Hall.  Every issue<br/>
discussed in the letter was a legitimate problem that every experienced bard<br/>
knew to be true.  This letter had such an impact that GZ decided to devote<br/>
an entire Arch Mage answers column to bards.  Do you think he would have<br/>
ever done that if the bard community had not raised legitimate concerns?  If<br/>
we had remained silent then most of the recent bard improvements might<br/>
likely have never happened.<br/>
<br/>
As to your statement about &quot;constantly complaining bards&quot; I think you are<br/>
totally off base.  While you are entitled to your opinion, I think most<br/>
people would agree that as a community bards are very professional and<br/>
polite and only started &quot;complaining&quot; when Abashi and GZ recently started<br/>
playing spin doctor in regards to the Lullaby and Pixie Strike issues.  They<br/>
are flat out wrong and every bards knows it.  Its only natural to get upset<br/>
when someone keeps telling you everything is working as intended when you<br/>
know its broke.  Other than that situation bards have never given Verant any<br/>
reason to think we are a bunch of whiners and complainers.  As a class we<br/>
are also most likely the politest in terms of online forums (mailing list<br/>
and Concert Hall).  If you don&#39;t think so, just read the caster class forums<br/>
at EQ Casters Realm.  <br/>

&gt; People do not respond to bitching and complaining in a positive way. How<br/>
&gt; many marriages have broken up to prove that?  Once there is so much<br/>
&gt; complaining the listening party often turns a deaf ear.  Do we want that?<br/>
&gt; Or is that what Verant has already done?  Are they tired of listening to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; constantly complaining Bards?  Is that why the focus on other classes?<br/>
