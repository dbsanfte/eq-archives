<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965906668">WOW!  Very nice climb.  Gives me something to strive for.  So far, I&#39;ve been up the wizard spires, and the RV bank, but than I&#39;m only 13th, so have a little while before I can attempt that one.  Nice to know I&#39;m not the only dare devil bard around.  Everyone thinks I&#39;m nuts, but hey, it&#39;s a great view up there. *smiles*<br/>

  Well, I was slightly bored on Saturday, so I decided to climb the statue of Firiona Vie in FV.  Anything that tall is just meant to be climbed :).  I don&#39;t think it would be possible to anyone not a Bard, but it may be possible.  Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/">http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/</a> for screenshots and a description of how I did it.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope a few of you try it yourself, it&#39;s a blast and a great view : )<br/>
