<b>Subject:</b> RE: Brad On Binding (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065283976">You ARE level 33, despite all these problems. Brad and them<br/>
have basically laid down the law on binding -- they aren&#39;t changing it.<br/>
If you want bind so bad, you have done the exact right thing<br/>
by creating a character that can do it.<br/>
<br/>
It is strange, not having bind. But it is part of the class, and<br/>
I can live with it.<br/>

&gt;I myself find it hard to play in a regular group, my playing times vary<br/>
&gt;from week to week, usually depending on when my girlfriend is at work  =)<br/>
&gt;I work 9-5 and unless she is working when I am at home I cannot play (she<br/>
&gt;hates EQ). Therefore I am joining pickup groups and dieing more than I<br/>
&gt;probably would if I had a regular group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I find it annoying that we don&#39;t get bind affinity, mainly because we are<br/>
&gt;the weakest of all melee classes, however we are one of the bes classes at<br/>
&gt;agro&#39;ing mobs onto us, I think Verant should consider either giving bards<br/>
&gt;bind affinity OR, give us a song that allows us to Feing Death, monks are<br/>
&gt;very similar to bards, being weak (lack of AC & hp&#39;s), and they deal a hell<br/>
&gt;of a lotta dmg, so they tend to take alot of dmg, however they can just<br/>
&gt;feign death and they are fine, I rarely see a monk has been killed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Verant say that having melee&#39;ers bound outside a dungeon is unfair because<br/>
&gt;they can just get killed and zone back in and join in on the fight again,<br/>
&gt;this is not the case with bards, we have to mem songs (as we all know this<br/>
&gt;takes a good 5 minutes). And how are we gonna be any good unless we pick up<br/>
&gt;ALL of our equipment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the Sol&#39;s I have to<br/>
&gt;run all the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to my corpse,<br/>
&gt;aswell as mem my songs and loose an hours worth of hard earned exp. To be<br/>
&gt;honest it is starting to **** me off and as I die about 5 times (at least)<br/>
&gt;every level this is wasting my valuable playing time, hence the reason I<br/>
&gt;have now started up a cleric, it&#39;s great, I get bind, gate etc and if I do<br/>
&gt;die, I&#39;ll only have to spend 20 seconds memming my spells. + at later<br/>
&gt;levels I&#39;ll be able to res myself  =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I enjoy playing my bard and have got to level 33 through alot of hard work,<br/>
&gt;I have great equipment for my level and am VERY keen to get to level 40+<br/>
&gt;but I jus can&#39;t see it happening, I don&#39;t know how you level 40+ bards on<br/>
&gt;this list do it.  I spoke to a level 50 bard on my server (Tegamen, I<br/>
&gt;think), he was wearing some imbrued and had some great equipment. So I<br/>
&gt;asked him if he had any tips on how to level fast, he replied &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot; I<br/>
&gt;said that I find it very hard not to die, he replied &quot;Trust me, Bards got<br/>
&gt;the bad deal&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Guess thats sums it all up then, I am still determined to reach level 50,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;ll just take me a few years  =)<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree.  I usually find myself joining pickup groups.  What I have found<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the<br/>
&gt;problem is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when<br/>
&gt;I play<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull<br/>
&gt;turns bad<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far<br/>
&gt;away,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the<br/>
&gt;casters<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back<br/>
&gt;to the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;zone they died in.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this<br/>
&gt;into<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs<br/>
&gt;personal<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;welfare.<br/>
