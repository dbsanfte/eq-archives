<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-198075046">This past weekend I started using Pixie Strike for the first time on a<br/>
regular basis.  In terms of a data sample, I only used it in two different<br/>
situations so thats not a good sample but the results I got were at the<br/>
opposite extreme so I&#39;ll go ahead and throw them out.  <br/>
<br/>
First use was in Lower Guk.  I&#39;m only 29th level so I probably shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have even gone there but I was with five guildmates all in their mid-high<br/>
30s so I felt relatively safe.  We were on the live side pulling shin<br/>
knights and urd shamans to the bottom of the ramp near the zone.  If we<br/>
pulled two or more, it was agreed that I would try to Pixie Strike one until<br/>
the other five people finished off the first (or second) one.  I was able to<br/>
get the eyes glazed over message on just about every mob I Pixied.<br/>
Sometimes they would initially resist but I eventually got the success<br/>
message.   On every situation where I got the eyes glaze over message, the<br/>
frog kept attacking me.  I know for a fact the other five people weren&#39;t<br/>
hitting it because they were all visibly attacking the other mob.  I also<br/>
never turned on autoattack so know that I didn&#39;t mistakenly wake up the mob<br/>
I just mezzed.  My results in Lower Guk were exactly similar to those that<br/>
John Kim and others have been writing about over the past few weeks.  In<br/>
other words, the mob didn&#39;t resist but the Pixie Strike ended up having no<br/>
effect.<br/>
<br/>
Second situation was in ghost room in Unrest.  I used Pixie against tentacle<br/>
terrors, barbed bone skeles, and greater dark bones.  Results this time were<br/>
more in line with what you expect.  Assuming they didn&#39;t resist, once I got<br/>
the eyes glazed over message I could keep cycling the song and keep the mob<br/>
out of the fight.  Never got attacked once while playing this song.  <br/>
<br/>
Granted this was only two situations, but wondering if the level difference<br/>
between you and the mob you are facing has an impact on if they ignore the<br/>
effects of a successful Pixie Strike?  In the heat of battle, I usually<br/>
forgot to con most of the stuff I was fighting.  I assume the frogs in Lower<br/>
Guk are higher level than the stuff in Unrest.  The frogs I did con were<br/>
almost always red to me.  The barbed bones conned blue/even to me and IIRC<br/>
the GDBs were yellow and red.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; If you use it on yourself, it&#39;s either resist or stun.  It<br/>
&gt; seems to be more effective against mobs as well, although it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; resisted more now that they added the MR debuff to it (or<br/>
&gt; maybe all the mobs I&#39;ve been fighting lately have MR buffs).  <br/>
&gt; There are still cases of the song seemingly not working, but<br/>
&gt; they are not frequent enough for me to consider the song less<br/>
&gt; than useless.<br/>
