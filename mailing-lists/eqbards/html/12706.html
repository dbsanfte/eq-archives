<div id="ygrps-yiv-607139170">Lady Vox:  Damn, why is that bard still standing there singing those blasted<br/>
songs? I got a message saying &quot;Shada flees in terror&quot; when I loosed my<br/>
Dragon Roar.  She should be hightailing it out of here by now.  This poor<br/>
coding is unacceptable.  I&#39;m sending GZ a note telling him to look into<br/>
this.  Guess I&#39;ll just have to go swat her instead.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; ok i asked this before but everyone may have missed it.  i believe Nag&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; fear spell is called Dragon Roar, correct?  well that&#39;s the one i see<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; looks like fear and it says i resist the Dragon Roar spell.  now, i<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; even remember the last time i was feared, but what happens now is<br/>
&gt; sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; i get the resist message as expected, and other times i get the message<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; i lose control of myself and i have the fear icon, but there is no<br/>
&gt; effect<br/>
&gt; &gt; (i.e. i am undoubtedly not feared).  what&#39;s up with that?<br/>
