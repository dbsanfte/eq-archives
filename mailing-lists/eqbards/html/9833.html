nullify magic about a month ago.  My friends and I tested it<br/>
pretty extensively in the Arena and it tended to follow LIFO<br/>
(last in first out) order when canceling icons, but didn&#39;t<br/>
always follow it.<br/>

safe when Cazic regularly had 50+ people in it camping for<br/>
rubicite.  I dunno anymore.  But given a choice between having<br/>
to run past hordes of L15-22 lizards to get to the zone, vs.<br/>
having to run past hordes of L35-45 frogs to get to the zone,<br/>
I would take the lizards.<br/>
