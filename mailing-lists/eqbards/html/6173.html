<div id="ygrps-yiv-191035646">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 16 Bard (love the dance song ;)) and am just now starting for<br/>
fight in Unrest.  I owuld love to be able to weave Purifying and Elemental<br/>
rhythms for my party in there, but they don&#39;t seem to stack.  In the song<br/>
analysis, however, it says that they can be.  Any suggestions?<br/>
