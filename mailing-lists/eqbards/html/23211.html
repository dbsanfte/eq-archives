<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584182602">OK that explains it then.  I thought our slow songs prevented the<br/>
enchanter/shaman slows from sticking in the first place.  Now I don&#39;t have<br/>
to worry about waiting for the enchanter/shaman to cast the spell before<br/>
singing Cessation.<br/>

Chords of Cessation is an AE slow and a DOT.  When your enchanter casts<br/>
his slow on the same target, it overwrites Cessation because his slow is<br/>
stronger (in terms of how much it slows down the mob&#39;s attacks).  The next<br/>
pulse of your song you can hit the mob with Cessation again, but it will<br/>
now only act as a DOT because the enchanter&#39;s stronger slow is already in<br/>
place.   The two slows will not &quot;stack&quot; cummulatively, the stronger simply<br/>
wins.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, you can play Verses of Victory while you already have a much<br/>
faster enchanter haste buff.  You will get both haste buff icons at the<br/>
same time, but they aren&#39;t really &quot;stacking&quot;.   You are only receiving the<br/>
str/ac components from Verses of Victory.<br/>

&gt; I would like some clarification on how our slow songs stack with<br/>
&gt; enchanter/shaman slows.  This past weekend I was grouped with an<br/>
enchanter.<br/>
&gt; I had Chords of Cessation memmed but was not singing it until the<br/>
enchanter<br/>
&gt; slowed the mob.  During one fight the enchanter was late slowing the mob<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; I went ahead and used Cessation.  After my song went into effect, the<br/>
&gt; enchanter cast his slow spell.  I got a message saying the my Cessation<br/>
song<br/>
&gt; wore off immediately followed by the message that the enchanter&#39;s slow<br/>
spell<br/>
&gt; stuck.  I got the Cessation effect &quot;wore off&quot; message before the song&#39;s<br/>
&gt; normal duration passed.  So it appeared that the enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>
&gt; overwrote Cessation.  So what I am wondering is if the enchanter slow<br/>
spell<br/>
&gt; actually negated Cessation or if the enchanter&#39;s slow message was an error<br/>
&gt; and his slow did not stick?<br/>
