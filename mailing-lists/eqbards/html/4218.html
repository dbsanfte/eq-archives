<div id="ygrps-yiv-859457003">Afraid I have to disagree again Bob.  Evolution of the language is<br/>
not a bad thing, it is a necessity of life, get used to it.  With thinking<br/>
like this we would still be speaking Middle English, at best, and having<br/>
serious discussions would be extremely dificult, if not impossible.  Logic<br/>
like you profess would make progress equally impossible.  Would you still<br/>
have us refer to computers as Babbage computational engines?  I think not.<br/>
Language evolves, into many branches, in many directions.  Some things<br/>
become part of the mainstream language, others are cast aside as being<br/>
trivial to the general public.  <br/>
	There is no rudeness involved, no malice, simply a desire to<br/>
communicate more quickly.  There is no conspiracy, period.  People do not<br/>
sit around dreaming up jargon in order to keep others in the dark, they<br/>
create it to make it easier to communicate with those who understand it,<br/>
because those are the people they most need to communicate to.  <br/>
	When an intelligent person encounters a term he doesn&#39;t understand,<br/>
he asks or looks it up.  The only stupid question is the one that isn&#39;t<br/>
asked.<br/>
	Oh and by the way, IBM is an acronym as well.  But tell someone you<br/>
work for International Business Machines and see how many people in the<br/>
general populace make the connection.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM systems difficult<br/>
&gt;and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>
&gt;companies moved away from secret code. </span></blockquote></div>
