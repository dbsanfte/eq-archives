&gt;So, I admit it.  We cheated.  We exploited the fact that this guy was stuck<br/>
&gt;in a gate to escpe with our skins intact.  Perhaps we should have stood<br/>
&gt;there and waited for him to kill us with DoT spells to avoid taking <br/>
&gt;advantage of the bug.  But as usual with issues like this, my question is,<br/>
&gt;&quot;Where&#39;s the fun in that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrm - here&#39;s how I look at it.  Monster can target me. Monster can hurt me.<br/>
Therefore monster is a valid legal target.  The fact is, the company is<br/>
allowing NPCs to cheat (cf. Sharks attacking people levitating), but won&#39;t<br/>
allow us to take advantage of real-world physics (a monster isn&#39;t smart<br/>
enough to climb over the gate, so he keeps blasting with spells.)  I&#39;m a<br/>
bit disappointed in Verant&#39;s whole &quot;we don&#39;t care if it&#39;s our fault - you<br/>
still can&#39;t do it&quot; policy.  That&#39;s like me going over to your house,<br/>
playing monopoly, and getting kicked out when I put two hotels on the same<br/>
spot.  Rather than fix the issue (which they continuously claim to be<br/>
doing, yet these bugs still exist?) they penalize the players.<br/>
<br/>
Before you jump on me about this, let me point out something - many of<br/>
these mobs have the ability to target us through walls, all casters can<br/>
cast through walls - this puts players at a distinct disadvantage. Sure,<br/>
there&#39;s the potential for abuse - so I say, Verant, fix the pathing<br/>
problems, but stop bopping people for defending themselves.  Geez  - they<br/>
see nothing wrong with Mules (goodbye economy) or twinking (goodbye game<br/>
balance), but this they have a problem with.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing my account is cancelled, or I&#39;d cancel it *grins*<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I do hope they fix some of these bugs.<br/>
