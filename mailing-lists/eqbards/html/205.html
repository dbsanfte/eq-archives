<b>Subject:</b> A lot of misinformation <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053234638">I could spend hours trying to correct a lot of misinformation being posted<br/>
by some people. I would ask that if you aren&#39;t 100% sure about the<br/>
information you give, don&#39;t post it as a statement, rather ask it as a<br/>
question. <br/>
<br/>
It reveals to me there&#39;s a lot of poor deductive logic going on with some<br/>
players - drawing conclusions from game experiences that are more based on<br/>
coincidence than on good research.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>
going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>
truth.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big difference between:<br/>
<br/>
---- &quot;Hill Giants can outrun Selo&#39;s&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
---- &quot;A Hill Giant seemed to outrun my Selo&#39;s, has anyone else seen this?&quot;<br/>
The complicated thing is that one MAY have tested this fully, and thus could<br/>
say:<br/>
---- &quot;I tried running 10 times from a Hill Giant and here are the<br/>
results....&quot;<br/>
