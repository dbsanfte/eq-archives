&gt; It&#39;s hard to have sympathy for you, when you turn a<br/>

some of you aren&#39;t going to believe those of us who are (were)<br/>
having this problem.  Unfortunately at this point, there&#39;s no<br/>
real way to prove it (unless someone in one of these funks can<br/>
provide data).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the problem here is that nobody counted missed notes<br/>
before that fateful patch.  I don&#39;t think Chris is complaining<br/>
of the same problem I originally was (an extraordinarily large<br/>
number of missed notes).  He&#39;s claiming he&#39;s missing notes on<br/>
songs where he&#39;d almost never missed notes before.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d tend to agree with him - subjectively I&#39;d say I&#39;m still<br/>
failing to start up easy songs Hymn and Accelerando more than<br/>
before.  I do find it odd that people are reporting about a 5%<br/>
failure rate for these songs, as before that patch I would&#39;ve<br/>
estimated it closer to 0%-2%.  But without pre-patch data,<br/>
we&#39;ll never know for sure.  Anyhow, 5% is tolerable.<br/>
