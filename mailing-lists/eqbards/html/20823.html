&gt;<br/>
&gt;we&#39;ve had several machines using the via 133 (not 133a) chipset locking up<br/>
&gt;with various video cards using the later drivers.  unfortunately, it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;one specific video card, or driver...it seems to be somewhat random.<br/>
&gt;as for your problem, make SURE that voodoo is not overheating.  if it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;being jerky and whatnot sometimes, and locks up with newer drivers, sounds<br/>
&gt;like you have a clockspeed/heating problem.  for gits and shiggles, try<br/>
&gt;running the machine with the case open and a small house fan blowing through<br/>
&gt;it.  if that seems to cure the problem, then you have airflow blockage, so<br/>
&gt;you need new fans/more fans, something.  also, check to make sure that the<br/>
&gt;cabling for the hard drive/floppy drive, etc. are not hanging in the way of<br/>
&gt;the fans/airflow.  we use zip-tie strips to get them out of the way of the<br/>
&gt;airflow when we build machines at work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;good luck<br/>

these things and tell people where to download the &quot;nosmoke.exe&quot; patch. :-)<br/>

Oh, if you have a cat, I wouldn&#39;t suggest you leave your case off of it <br/>
unless you like finding your cables all munched. :-P Pets are bad as well <br/>
since their hair gets into everything.<br/>
<br/>
Nice tips all though.<br/>
