&gt;i don&#39;t remember a patch since i fought that level 50 cleric in a duel, and<br/>
&gt;it worked wonders, interrupting him every time.  that was approximately 1<br/>
&gt;week ago.  guess i have to try it again.  this will KILL my duel strategy =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually i duel&#39;d a friend of mine, also a lvl 50 cleric. I tried out the<br/>
psalm of mystic shielding plus my base 38 magic resistance. I resisted<br/>
everything. And i mean everything. Poor guy did 0 dmg to me (might have hit<br/>
me once if he had tried to use his mace heh). Stuns, blindness,<br/>
Retribution, etc. Total resists everytime. Inbetween my interrupting him<br/>
with pixie strike and my 100% immunity to his spells... he was pretty<br/>
frustrated. One nice thing about pixie strike also is that it will stun<br/>
them still... so if they are running around like a chicken with their head<br/>
cut off, this will nail them in their tracks so you can get up the shield,<br/>
chain them, and then maybe a pulse of verses of victory or the lvl 48<br/>
largos or whatever else you want before turning on attack. This was my real<br/>
first pvp attempt ever btw, just didnt expect to whip him so soundly :)<br/>
