<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206956019">I&#39;m inclined to believe perhaps GZ&#39;s statements earlier were a semi-call for<br/>
suggestions, so here&#39;s mine (commentary welcome):<br/>
<br/>
Cinda&#39;s Companion Cantata<br/>
Level: 49th+<br/>
Skill: Variable (see below)<br/>
Description: A cantata is a composition scored for many parts at once,<br/>
incorporating both voice and instrumental accompaniment, hence this song<br/>
would allow bards in the same group to ally their voices in song to<br/>
intensify the effects of a common song - to &quot;stack&quot; the same song, perhaps<br/>
with at 100*(2-((6-n)^(1/6)))% effectiveness, where n is the number of bards<br/>
playing cantata. Yes, this could be exceptionally powerful, what with<br/>
twisting and all, but this could easily be limited to only effect the &quot;top&quot;<br/>
bard song in the spell list of the lead singer, whilst the &quot;recovery&quot; period<br/>
of stopping the song would be such that twisting wouldn&#39;t be possible if you<br/>
were a cantata player.<br/>
Example: A group composed of 1 warrior and 2 bards stops to rest. Bard 1<br/>
begins to sing Hymn, only to be joined in song by bard 2 with Cinda&#39;s<br/>
Cantata - boosting regeneration by their now intensity music (by the SWAG<br/>
formula above that would be a +69%).<br/>
Full stacking numbers would be:<br/>
n    +%<br/>
---    -----<br/>
1    69<br/>
2    74<br/>
3    80<br/>
4    88<br/>
5    100<br/>
Anyhow, I have no idea how to make a formal suggestion that wouldn&#39;t be lost<br/>
in /feedback, but none the less, here&#39;s mine. Also, this would be a<br/>
beautiful deeply involved story line &quot;quest&quot; song as we&#39;re currently lacking<br/>
anything to do once we get our lambent.<br/>
