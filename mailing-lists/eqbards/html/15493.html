&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;sorry this is off topic and I would happily accept as an answer a pointer to<br/>
&gt;where it is on topic...but my 2D card died and I leapt at the opportunity to<br/>
&gt;migrate to a voodoo3 2000. Well, I was guessing at all the correct settings,<br/>
&gt;but mip mapping seemed like a good idea, until I selected it and restarted.<br/>
&gt;At that point none of the textures were ones the designers intended and as<br/>
&gt;entertaining as it was to see an female Ogres face scroll across the sky I<br/>
&gt;am not sure I care for it as a steady diet. I settled on turning it off and<br/>
&gt;using &quot;Force mip mapping&quot; on the 3dfx control panel, which returned the<br/>
&gt;world to &quot;normal&quot;.<br/>
&gt;In short, is there a set of canonical settings for EQ and a Voodoo3 2000?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a similar problem - took many hilarious screenshots.  The long of it <br/>
is, however, I ended up reinstalling about 4 times before it finally fixed <br/>
itself.  And now that you mention it, I&#39;m thinking maybe the mipmapping was <br/>
disabled in the last reinstall...<br/>
