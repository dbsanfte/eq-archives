<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173436065">I&#39;ve had the exact same thing happen to me, I believe it&#39;s one of 2 things.<br/>
<br/>
1) If you were ever inside, you went up by the hand room where the mobs<br/>
there are stuck on the railing by the stairs, and got onto their hatelist.<br/>
Even though they&#39;re stuck there, they pass on that hate to other mobs that<br/>
can path to you.<br/>
<br/>
2) Sounds like you were sitting in the exact same spot we were when this<br/>
occured to me as well, right at the back of the house, almost straight in<br/>
line with the back door.  If that&#39;s the case I&#39;d be willing to be our song<br/>
effects are going through the ground into the basement and causing us to be<br/>
put onto a hate list.  (We were only getting &#39;prime&#39; pulls, werebats, hags,<br/>
gdb&#39;s etc -- basically basement critters)<br/>
<br/>
#2 can still occur even if the songs you were playing were non-aggr&#39;ing<br/>
songs (heal, accel, etc), there&#39;s a bug that occasionally occurs where<br/>
somehow even playing these songs places the bard onto the monsters hate<br/>
list.  To check this, try running around Crushbone with accel on, don&#39;t kill<br/>
or attack anything but occasionally you&#39;ll get the faction message after the<br/>
other person kills the orc.  As a result, always be careful running past<br/>
people killing &#39;good&#39; factioned creatures.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve noticed this phenomenum a lot in Unrest lately, and I&#39;ve heard people<br/>
&gt;here talking about it before.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been peacefully sitting up against the wall, minutes after a battle<br/>
&gt;healing my party up and strange things happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Picture this: There I am resting quietly, 100 feet away from the house.<br/>
&gt;*Creaaak*, opens the door.  A dry bones skeleten is standing there, takes a<br/>
&gt;look around, spots me out of a crowd of 30 camped players sitting against<br/>
&gt;the wall, and makes a b-line for me.  We handily dispatched him and all got<br/>
&gt;a good laugh.  30 seconds later.  *Creaaak*, opens the door.  A reanimated<br/>
&gt;hand is standing there, sniffs the air, spots me again and makes a run for<br/>
&gt;me, completely ignoring everyone else.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This happened four or five times before we were forced to zone.  My puller<br/>
&gt;was pretty happy that his job was so easy, until a flock of GDBs came<br/>
&gt;running and we had to run.  I hadn&#39;t even been into the house that night to<br/>
&gt;stir anything up.  This has happened to me on several occasions.  Its<br/>

&gt;Well, one thing I like about this group is you all<br/>
&gt;actually LIKE playing a bard.  That may sound silly<br/>
&gt;but a lot of message boards out there are just<br/>
&gt;whinning about the class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I had heard about the &#39;tauting&#39; effects of our<br/>
&gt;songs, but for the most part, it never bothered me,<br/>
&gt;sure I get the mobs attention, and even take a lot of<br/>
&gt;dammage, no biggie, just make nice with the cleric.<br/>
&gt;Well, after turning 21, Guk and Unrest have become<br/>
&gt;whole new places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First guk, near the scryer room my party of six where<br/>
&gt;bashing every froglock in sight, gaining massive exp<br/>
&gt;and loot.  So we say, what the heck, lets go in the<br/>
&gt;room.  Well, on knight comes after us, so I use my<br/>
&gt;melodic binding song that I love so much.  Big<br/>
&gt;mistake, from behind one of our tanks I saw no less<br/>
&gt;than 15 assorted froglocks come up the stairs, and who<br/>
&gt;do you think they were headed for?  Well, after about<br/>
&gt;5 minutes of root, root, root, root, I was taking the<br/>
&gt;long walk back from freeport.  Get back, grab my<br/>
&gt;stuff, play anthem for my friends in battle, and what<br/>
&gt;do you think happened?  Again, I&#39;m dragged down under<br/>
&gt;a sea of amphibious flesh.  So after a while, I say,<br/>
&gt;heck, I&#39;ll head over to good ole unrest, what could be<br/>
&gt;safer?  Get there, find some good friends I could<br/>
&gt;trust, and we get to slayin undead.  One of the dry<br/>
&gt;bones makes a run for the house, silly bard that I am,<br/>
&gt;I chase him, again, still singing a song, forget which<br/>
&gt;one.  Withing seconds the doors fly open and carrion,<br/>
&gt;monks and the reclusive ghoul magi beeline right at<br/>
&gt;the wide eyed me, who didn&#39;t even have time to type in<br/>
&gt;a profanity.  So I come back from butchers block.<br/>
&gt;Fighting a while, see a wisp to the left of the house,<br/>
&gt;facing the back.  Someone in my guild needed a light<br/>
&gt;stone, so I run to grab it, while singing my little<br/>
&gt;anthem.  All of a sudden, the hag 3 floors up starts<br/>
&gt;casting on me from a window, and I wake up at home<br/>
&gt;among the trees.  That sucked.  Does this mean we<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t use any of our aoe or buffs anywhere near a<br/>
&gt;dungeon?  Well, at least my calves are built up from<br/>
&gt;zone running :)<br/>
