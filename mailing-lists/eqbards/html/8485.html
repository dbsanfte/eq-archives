<div id="ygrps-yiv-370520373">Hmmm, is that what these funny looking gloves are made of?  are you sure?<br/>
That&#39;s disgusting surely they just call&#39;em that, they aren&#39;t really made of<br/>
the skin of a sentient being at all, naw just another marketing ploy like<br/>
Naugahide right?  <br/>
<br/>
I have tried for the belt and been laughed off the auction channel.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure why but there were multiple laughers so I backed off.  I did almost get<br/>
a thick banded belt bizarrely from one of the guys who said I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
chance in Guk of seeing a troll hide belt.  Bizarre, truly bizarre.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about the claws.  Umm, no def not my style.  In fact, now that I<br/>
think about it, ick.  I&#39;d rather use my crappy combine scimmy than look like<br/>
some wolvie clone or mr krueger&#39;s understudy.  Sigh, guess if I insist on<br/>
cool and useful I&#39;ll just have to wait.  I&#39;d settle for cool though.<br/>

Since you are hanging out in Guk, try to get your hands on the dark elf hide<br/>
gloves and the troll-hide belt.  They are bard/rogue only so the demand<br/>
isn&#39;t as<br/>
high for them.  Those two will give you ten more points to your STR.  After<br/>
I<br/>
got those two items I was able to start wearing bronze plate and still have<br/>
room<br/>
to carry stuff.  My base STR is 76 and with items is now 100.  Another<br/>
option is<br/>
the Blackened Iron Crown in Runnyeye. I think it also adds five points to<br/>
STR<br/>
plus bonuses to resists.  For weapons, thulian claws seem to be the bard<br/>
weapon<br/>
of choice for those in their 20s and will cost around 400PP.<br/>

&gt; Hail all!<br/>
&gt; After my latest adventure grouping with our guilds new wizard in cleri&#39;c<br/>
&gt; clothing I decided to foray off and try my hand at soloing once more.  I<br/>
&gt; have journeyed to far off Upper Guk where I have been taking on the Heart<br/>
&gt; Spiders found there.  The experience has thus far been most fruitful both<br/>

&gt; I think my armor is as good as it will be for a while, except maybe for my<br/>
&gt; helm.  I have Barbed Arms and legs, Crush tunic, Bloodstained Mantle,<br/>
&gt; Bearskin Boots, a sleek black cape, Leatherfoot Raider&#39;s helm, 2 jagged<br/>
&gt; bands, bracer of erolissi, silver-plated bracer, purity belt (still?),<br/>
&gt; electrum pearl necklace (upgrade to gold?).  I use a chitin shell shield<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dual wield depending on the situation.  Any ideas what armor upgrades I<br/>

&gt; <br/>
