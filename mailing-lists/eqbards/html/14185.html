&gt; &gt;the mask&#39;s UV affect.  While its not a big deal it is a bug <br/>
&gt; and we should<br/>
&gt; &gt;probably send it in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It IS a big deal if it is also affecting the spell. I believe <br/>
&gt; ENchanters and<br/>
&gt; Shamans get the spell. (not sure about shamans) To cast the <br/>
&gt; spell requires<br/>
&gt; 1)<br/>
&gt; memming it (Enchanters usually have enough spells needed that <br/>
&gt; this spell<br/>
&gt; would get swapped in and out) and 2) mana. If it is going to <br/>
&gt; continually be<br/>
&gt; dropped...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm. I would expect Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord to affect people&#39;s ultravision<br/>
buffs as well. This would certainly make bards unpopular especially to the<br/>
races like Erudites, Humans and Barbarians who have normal vision.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You might want to try the song that gives Infravision and see <br/>
&gt; if it affects<br/>
&gt; someone<br/>
&gt; that has Serpent Sight up as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, if an Enchanter has Illusion: dark elf up, does this <br/>
&gt; song affect THAT<br/>
&gt; Ultravision?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it did given the way the bard songs overwrite<br/>
other spells&#39; effects. This is something that&#39;d be good to &quot;bug&quot; as I would<br/>
expect our song to not overwrite others&#39; vision buffs. Point taken.<br/>

&gt; *grin* Enchanters have been complaining recently about this <br/>
&gt; for their whole<br/>
&gt; Illusion series of spells. That we have a whole line that is <br/>
&gt; just a &quot;toy&quot;<br/>
&gt; now that they have changed the way it affects faction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, though, what might be affecting you is that they can see through<br/>
&gt; illusion to your religion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yea, this has always been strange that NPC&#39;s can tell your religion by<br/>
looking at you, regardless of your illusion. It&#39;s about the only time<br/>
religion becomes a factor, and is why we have all these agnostic enchanters<br/>
in the game.<br/>
<br/>
What was the change they made to the way illusions affects faction?<br/>
