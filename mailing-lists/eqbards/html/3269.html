<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192404726">That&#39;s one of the great things about EQ!  You can MAKE fiends.  Take one<br/>
lost soul with a mis-located corpse.  Put into group with a bard (that&#39;s<br/>
you), play Lyssa&#39;s & combine!  You have fashioned something entirely new!  A<br/>
new fiend.  And if you take up tailoring (I am a broken record - but you<br/>
keep axeing and I keep telling) you can make patchwork armor for players.<br/>
That is actually a bit more tricky.<br/>
<br/>
Most players who want and need the armor are just a bit young to hunt for<br/>
the skins needed to make it.  So, you have to get a group together and hunt<br/>
as a group.  Then there is the failure rate and the sp for the pattern seems<br/>
so expensive at that level.  But the more you do it the better it gets.<br/>
<br/>
My advice to you is: do some mail delivery quests. They pay pretty well and<br/>
they are something you know how to do - travel from city to city.  To make<br/>
fiends - axe someone - anyone if they wanna do it with you.  Traveling with<br/>
another person is hard - esp at your level - whr all the monsties are gonna<br/>
go agro on you.  But it should be really exciting!  And you will get gp for<br/>
your travels.  With about 5gp you should be able to get a solid base in<br/>
patchwork skill and be able to make armor for your new soon to be fiends!<br/>
<br/>
When I started EQ - it was cuz some of my other game guild bubbies were<br/>
doing it.  One guy was in between consulting jobs and played it for a month<br/>
- needless to say - he got pretty far ahead of us.  Then 2 more started and<br/>
they play same time and same amounts as each other so they group all the<br/>
time. They got up some.  And then I started with about 6 more of our same<br/>
buddies.  One guy has now powergamer&#39;d up to the top guys level - or close<br/>
(both low 20&#39;s). One guy took a wiz to lev 8 and quit cuz he felt he dint<br/>
have the time for the game (ie not enough time to stay at levels with rest<br/>
of us.) Three of us took chars to low teens and then restarted chars with<br/>
better base or diff class.  Now us three have caught the rest except out 2<br/>
low 20 guys.<br/>
<br/>
I go in spurts between powergamer and goofing off.  For example, this<br/>
weekend, my end Nadare - level 14 Enchanter goes: &quot;not sleeping until I get<br/>
level 16!&quot;  Well, ok.  So, we stay up all Friday night and travel everywhere<br/>
in search of the elusive xp.  She gets 15, I get 14 and its about 10 am Sat<br/>
morning.  Things are looking good.  Then she goes: &quot;brb, gotta go out for<br/>
more cigs.&quot;  Ok, np.  Ok, 2 hours later and she&#39;s still not back. Hmmm.<br/>
Well, keep playing until about 5pm Sat then I gots to camp too.  After<br/>
dinner I was so tired there was no way.  Sleep sleep sleep and up Sun at 8am<br/>
- back on line.  &quot;/w nadare  all&quot; - where were you? &quot;Fell alseep rebooting<br/>
pc.&quot;  Heheh how many times I have done that.  Esp zoning!  <br/>
<br/>
But when you play until you are totally fatigued - you find yourself doing<br/>
dumb stuff.  Like getting lost in cities you normally know like the back of<br/>
your hand.  Or all of a sudden you wonder - did they change this zone?<br/>
Misty thicket never looked like this before, Hmmm. Or you have to do &quot;/w<br/>
sylly all&quot; just to find out what zone you are in.<br/>
<br/>
But I know what its like to have fiends and have levels divide you.  And<br/>
know how fun ot can be to make new fiends and adventure with them.  So, I&#39;d<br/>
say don&#39;t be afraid to axe them to do stuff with you.  Travel from Freeport<br/>
to Kelethin at your level and with people who have never done it - can be<br/>
really thrilling.  But you have to talk to them - talk to everyone and you<br/>
should have no trouble making fiends!.<br/>
<br/>
So - don&#39;t give up - but do strat talking to people!<br/>
<br/>
Sylly - the bard!<br/>

Once again, I changed servers to play with some people I knew and once<br/>
again, the people are moving on.  (btw, not following the same ppl from<br/>
server to server but it&#39;s happened twice that ppl have convinced me to a<br/>
certain server and then have left).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to find a group (guild?) of ppl that are more concerned with<br/>
character development (roleplay) than just power levelling.  I don&#39;t<br/>
care what server it&#39;s on ... so long as I can find a &quot;home&quot; where the<br/>
people are friendly and actually maybe return a &quot;hail&quot; every now and<br/>
then.  I&#39;m getting sorta discouraged because I don&#39;t have a predefined<br/>
group of people to hunt with, so I end up solo-ing alot.  And running<br/>
around Norrath not talking to anyone gets kinda lonely.  Maybe it&#39;s me,<br/>
I dunno.  But if I don&#39;t find a solution then I may just bag EQ<br/>
altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts, ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
