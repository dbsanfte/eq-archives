<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408752869">I think you make some valid points, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t agree where Bards are<br/>
concerned.  Here&#39;s why:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Time is money.  Time is experience.  If I am bound 5 seconds away from my<br/>
&gt;current position, I can fight a lot more riskier and gain a lot more xp than<br/>
&gt;if I am bound 10 minutes away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is only true if you don&#39;t die, as exp loss from a single death will wipe<br/>
out many kills.  I usually lose 1/2 hour to an hour&#39;s worth of exp from a death.<br/>
If you don&#39;t die, then you didn&#39;t need the bind anyway, so you could have killed<br/>
the same amount of stuff with, or without it.  If you DO die, then saving that<br/>
10 minutes isn&#39;t going to let you get back that lost exp.<br/>
<br/>
What Bind will get you, is letting you play for that 10 minutes, rather than<br/>
run.  But the exp loss will be the same.  The amount of exp you can get in 10<br/>
minutes is a tiny, tiny fraction of what you lose by dying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our songs do not FORCE us to attract attention.  Bellow all the way.  Save<br/>
&gt;the healing song for downtime reduction.  It can be done if your current<br/>
&gt;group is not adequate to protect you from harm.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are correct that you can play without singing AOE songs.  However, since<br/>
that limits you to  5 percent of our songlist, it stops you from being a Bard.<br/>
To limit yourself to Bellow and Warsong in a group makes you a dual wielding<br/>
enchanter/cleric/shaman who has decided to &#39;tank&#39;.  Very unproductive.  Doing<br/>
that, you&#39;ve stopped being a Bard.  I don&#39;t think a good solution is to say,<br/>
just don&#39;t play songs...  I doubt that a mob with 5K worth of hps cares much<br/>
about my 15 points of bellow.<br/>
<br/>
Also, no group can protect you if you are doing your job, buffing and healing<br/>
and whatnot.  The tanks can get the attention of the target mob, but all others<br/>
will be on you.  The only protection you can get is to have your enchanter AOE<br/>
Mez all of the time, and that still prevents you from DoT&#39;ing, Lullabye&#39;ing,<br/>
etc.  I don&#39;t think a good solution for this is to stop using the songs that<br/>
define our class.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind the dying, I mind not playing as much because I run back so much<br/>
more often than anyone else.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When a warrior dies, he has no sow, he has no invisibility, he has no summon<br/>
&gt;corpse spell.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true. But, to compensate he dies much less often than a Bard does.  If<br/>
you recall my original post, I say that adding Parry would move us from the<br/>
Caster class to a true Hybrid class.  That would mean that we should not get<br/>
bind, as we have the defensive powers of a melee class.  There&#39;s a reason that<br/>
the casters get bind and a warrior doesn&#39;t.  We&#39;re just on the wrong side of<br/>
that classification.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bards aren&#39;t that bad off, at all.  Bards are the best non-binder at getting<br/>
&gt;to the corpse and returning to a safe point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s very true, in both cases.  We are a fine class, and I think not<br/>
underpowered at all.  We are also great at safely returning.  However, none of<br/>
us can return to our bodies instantly.  We lose time no matter what, during that<br/>
run.  Since we die the most often, we lose the most time.  Make us die less with<br/>
added defensive skills, or reduce our running time with Bind.  But one or the<br/>
other needs to be done to make our downtime the same as the other 13 classes in<br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I&#39;ve heard some say that using a 29th or higher cleric to res you is the<br/>
answer.  But really, if that were true, nobody at all should get bind.<br/>
<br/>
Golias&#39; Mantra!<br/>
<br/>
No power increases, no gate.  No reduction of deaths, which result in more exp<br/>
loss than others.  Just bind to let us play the same amount of time.<br/>
