<div id="ygrps-yiv-752594695">Atcually no I didn&#39;t simply put you guys have a ton more zones to hunt in<br/>
then we do. As for exploring I&#39;ve got 60 played days I&#39;ve seen every zone in<br/>
norrath. I have a right to be pissed of Verant released the game early<br/>
planning on itemizing certain high level zones and adding the rest of the<br/>
zones as people leveled up. Well guess what they didn&#39;t think we&#39;d level so<br/>
fast and play so much so now they are in deep shit and I have a right to be<br/>
pissed of when the two dungeons people hunt in for exp and items both have<br/>
over 100+ people at the same time and close to that every single night!!!<br/>
Especially when one of them can support maybe 30-40 people and the other<br/>
supports 60 tops.<br/>

&gt;Naeeldar,<br/>
&gt;Personally, Im getting tired of your posts on this topic.  Every one of<br/>
&gt;them says the same thing: low and mid levels aren&#39;t worthy to lick high<br/>
&gt;level&#39;s boots, high levels are the Gods, and should be treated as such (my<br/>
&gt;loose, but, i think, accurate interpretation of your posts here).  You&#39;re<br/>
&gt;high level, live with the consequenses.  No one promised you endless<br/>
&gt;excitement, perfect hunting zones, and new territories at level 50.  You<br/>
&gt;knew, pretty much from the start, that level 50 was the pinnacle.  You&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;reached the end (well maybe not the end, but more like a pause, until the<br/>
&gt;expansion comes out) of your journey in EQ.  Why not do a little bit of<br/>
&gt;exploring now?  Im sure you haven&#39;t seen ALL of Norrath.  Why, the last few<br/>
&gt;days have been quite enjoyable for me, hiding out in Runnyeye, exploring<br/>
&gt;the parts of it (still going in invis tho) that I was too afraid to see<br/>
&gt;when I was of &quot;proper&quot; level to hunt there.  Found a merchant (wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;sell to me, go figure), a banker (killed one before I thought to try and<br/>
&gt;actually &quot;bank&quot; there!-- it works!), a really nifty Slime Elemental that<br/>
&gt;was a little tricky to get to at first, and a gelatinous cube that I have<br/>
&gt;yet to find, as well as some underwater passageways that I still have yet<br/>
&gt;to explore.  Also, try trade skills, or doing some RP events for your<br/>
&gt;guild, or just enjoying the company of the friends you have made in EQ.<br/>
&gt;Oh, and another thing: puh-lease trim your messages to the smallest amount<br/>
&gt;of quoting possible.  Its only good netiquette.<br/>
&gt;Can we have a plonk or kabong or something on this thread here?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/piss and vinegar mode off<br/>

&gt;Heh that was 2 months ago roughly I guess when  he stated that the majority<br/>
&gt;had a 30-40 level char. By now it&#39;s easily up to 35-45 probably higher. So<br/>
&gt;no your wrong and again their aren&#39;t problems at mid level you just want<br/>
&gt;something to be added for it for the hell of it we don&#39;t we want it to be<br/>
&gt;less crowded and able to hunt in zones.<br/>
