<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470773943">Well, obviously you are competing - I do NOT compete. Period.  Things like<br/>
cheating, duping, kill stealing affect confidence in the game itself - in<br/>
the game mechanics, etc. It&#39;s important to stop those things for confidence<br/>
reasons, not necessarily because it has such world shattering effects (at<br/>
least in EQ in it&#39;s current state)<br/>
<br/>
This is where the difference between play and competition comes in. I play<br/>
to PLAY not compete. Competition by it&#39;s nature has a winner and loser -<br/>
play does not. Does the first one to lvl 50 get a cookie that no one told<br/>
me about?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s a multi-player game with fixed-rate resources, where<br/>
&gt;things you do either directly or indirectly DOES affect<br/>
&gt;everyone else.  By definition, anything that helps someone<br/>
&gt;else is a disadvantage for me.  If that weren&#39;t the case, we<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t need to balance anything, and it wouldn&#39;t matter if<br/>
&gt;anyone cheated, duped, kill stole, harvested, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, you are looking at this as a competition. So what if it&#39;s crowded? I<br/>
hunt what I can, when I can - if someone else gets it, oh well. Mobs are<br/>
good little trains - another is along every X min. like clockwork. If an<br/>
area is so massively crowded that I can&#39;t move - I just log - or find<br/>
somewhere else to hunt.<br/>
<br/>
I regularly visit areas that are WAY under my level. I also regularly save<br/>
low level players from trains or certain death - I ENJOY doing that. Is my<br/>
presence depriving them of the joy of death? Do you think my presence there<br/>
is resented? If it is, I&#39;ve never heard anyone remark on it.<br/>
<br/>
If you let what another has affect YOUR enjoyment - that is a problem of<br/>
yours you need to address. Does your neighbor having a nicer car than you<br/>
bother you? A bigger house? A better income? Does it really affect you<br/>
adversely?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Can you deny that when too many people are in Unrest, your<br/>
&gt;enjoyment of the game suffers?  Do you think it suddenly<br/>
&gt;becomes that way once you exceed X number of people?  Of<br/>
&gt;course not.  As X increases from 0, the average enjoyment of<br/>
&gt;the players goes up (easier to break in), peaks, then starts<br/>
&gt;to go down.  Being too high level, twinked, having equipment<br/>
&gt;unavailable to others, etc, can cause your contribution to X<br/>
&gt;to be greater than 1; meaning if things are at the downward<br/>
&gt;slope of the enjoyment curve, your presence is hurting them<br/>
&gt;more than their presence is hurting you. </span></blockquote></div>
