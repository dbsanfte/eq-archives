<b>Subject:</b> Clarifications on &#39;Twisting&#39;  Bug or feature?  Read on. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-642850627">Let me make this clear, if I can.<br/>
<br/>
BARDS WERE DESIGNED WITH &#39;TWISTING&#39; IN MIND.  THIS IS NOT AN EXPLOIT, THIS<br/>
IS A DESIGN FEATURE.<br/>
<br/>
Now, since I&#39;ve hopefully cleared that up, lets move on to the next point.<br/>
<br/>
There is no increased hit or damage probability when you are:<br/>
<br/>
A:  Twisting or cycling songs.<br/>
<br/>
B: CLOSE to being encumbered, but not actually in the red, i.e., no stat<br/>
changes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Schafer, you are quite possibly doing yourself a great disservice by not<br/>
cycling songs at your level.<br/>
<br/>
Cycling Hymn is rather pointless at that level range, but there are so many<br/>
more options for you, and they continue to grow.  As I stated in a post last<br/>
week, a bard that doesn&#39;t cycle is like a warrior who refuses to wear plate<br/>
and use 2h weapons, or a wizard that refuses to memorize spells, a ranger<br/>
that doesn&#39;t track, a paladin that doesn&#39;t lay hands, etc.<br/>
<br/>

This actually would not surprise me if it&#39;s something Verant added recently,<br/>
since Twisting can somewhat be considered an exploit, even tho Verant has<br/>
not announced this, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see that they added the extra<br/>
damage to make up for the added bonuses of twisting.  This way they are<br/>
happy, and us the unknowing are not getting as much benefit as we thought.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t twist, I may switch up songs in battle if the needs<br/>
arise, but I have never found twisting to be that big a benefit.  At 17th<br/>
level the healing song only restores 7hp/tick while standing, and the<br/>
average monster is hitting for 20-50 pts per hit, so the heal isn&#39;t worth<br/>
it, when if I play anthem and it doesn&#39;t ever quit they get a more increased<br/>
attack rate, so therefore they do more damage.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think twisting is worth it.  The closest I come is while<br/>
bellowing, as soon as I see the damage message, I stop and restart the song.<br/>
This decreases the times between bellows almost in half.  I actually felt<br/>
guilty about this at first, but without doing this, I would have problems<br/>
fighting some of the black/white creatures that I tend to solo.<br/>
<br/>
I know that most bards do twist, and I do not hold this against you in any<br/>
ways, but are you wanting me to believe that the game was designed to do<br/>
this?  I don&#39;t believe it was, I think the reasons the songs don&#39;t stop<br/>
immediately is so that if you get bashed or stunned, that you can restart<br/>
the song without losing the effect of whichever song you were playing.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my 2cp.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now my other observation has anyone noticed that if a mob hits you while<br/>
&gt; you are starting up a song he seems to be hit for max damage?  I noticed<br/>
&gt; the difference awhile ago when I picked up bellow.  I used to play one<br/>
&gt; song during combat.  Once I got bellow I noticed that hits that landed<br/>
&gt; just as I started a song resulted in greater damage.  This is something<br/>
&gt; that I have seen while playing my mage character over the last few days.<br/>
&gt; If I am hit while casting death beetles almost always hit for 26 or so.<br/>
&gt; Can anyone else confirm it?  When I saw it I just thought I was seeing<br/>
&gt; things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      OUCH!  If this is true then Weaving songs may not be the best of<br/>
&gt;      ideas.  More chances for a full damage hit.  Anyone else notice this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I will watch closely from now on but my general impression is that he<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      might be right...  Makes being a support bard make much more sense.<br/>
&gt;      If this is true (shudder) then this could change the whole<br/>
&gt; methodology<br/>
&gt;      behind running a bard character.<br/>
