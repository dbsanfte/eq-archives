<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713493912">:P Ok, so I didn&#39;t check my e-mail for 2 days and you<br/>
all get chatty.  I see how it is...<br/>
<br/>
Alrighty, as to why working as intended isn&#39;t good<br/>
enough: Simple answer is gameplay.  I&#39;ve heard horror<br/>
stories of people trying to use the 51 (52?) travel<br/>
song only to have one member get hit and fall to their<br/>
death.  I&#39;ve also heard this song won&#39;t stack with<br/>
dead man floating which would fix the problems with<br/>
this song right there.<br/>
<br/>
What a lot of these songs should do (45th song, the<br/>
travel song, etc) is create more than one spell icon. <br/>
The upper level haste song that has the DS on it<br/>
should have the damage shield component seperate. <br/>
From what I&#39;ve heard, the DS is lost so quickly thus<br/>
canceling the whole song effect that upper level bards<br/>
simply switch to an earlier haste song.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why these &quot;working as intended&quot; songs were a<br/>
good idea but bad reality.<br/>
<br/>
Abashi&#39;s comments about our singing steel pissed me<br/>
off even more.  Exactly what are we balanced against<br/>
right now?  The warrior Cobalt is something I&#39;d love<br/>
to have. Don&#39;t most of the pieces have healing<br/>
properties in the form of self buffs to them?  I&#39;d<br/>
really love to know what moron thought the helm,<br/>
pants, and boots effects were balanced.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why lots of the older bards are still<br/>
chaffing at the whole lullaby issue is indeed how it<br/>
used to work.  But it&#39;s also how Verant decided to<br/>
handle that whole issue.  We have the head magic guy<br/>
at the time publicly stating it seems messed up. <br/>
We&#39;re told to wait patiently which we do, for 6 to 8<br/>
months. In that time the break another song but fix<br/>
it.  Then they break that song again and refuse to fix<br/>
it.  Then they have a mouthpiece come out and say<br/>
she&#39;ll get to the bottom of this who promptly tells us<br/>
some lame excuse about how it&#39;s never supposed to have<br/>
been useable after 30th.  So where&#39;s the upgrade of<br/>
lullaby around 29th???<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a bard that was around when you could use<br/>
lullaby as it used to be, you&#39;re more than likely<br/>
pretty pissed off right now.  The reason is because 2<br/>
classes (shaman and cleric) has essentially had their<br/>
own lullaby issue come up and it either got fixed or<br/>
is getting fixed.  Mark of Karn was nerfed, they<br/>
suggested fixes, and Verant went with the one the<br/>
clerics wanted. BTW, the fix wasn&#39;t one of the options<br/>
Verant gave them.  All that got done in about a week. <br/>
It seems now the shamen have gotten Verant to look<br/>
into their uber weapon.  How much you wanna bet they<br/>
get a fix close to what the shamen as a whole will be<br/>
happy with? <br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m one of those bards who got to play with<br/>
lullaby, you&#39;re asking if I&#39;m so livid, why do I play<br/>
a bard?  Mainly cause none of my secondaries are close<br/>
to 45.  However, I&#39;ve heard is said you can get a<br/>
warrior to close to that in 2 months or so.  Mine&#39;s<br/>
13th in 3 of my regular play days.  Oh, and with<br/>
bandages, I&#39;m soloing.  I figure a shaman is probably<br/>
closer to being a bard but I just don&#39;t like how<br/>
female barbarians look.  Hehe, and I am a true bard<br/>
when it comes to astetics :P (I saw an absolutely<br/>
perfect combo.  Runed mithril tunic with BI leggins,<br/>
arms, boots, gloves and a leather helm.  The half-elf<br/>
wearing it looked great. Mithril BP, arms, and<br/>
leggings with singing steel bracers, gauntlets, helm<br/>
and boots looks awesome too.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to sum up, Abashi is full of it, I&#39;m bitter,<br/>
and I think it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to make choices<br/>
in armor that cut down your AC but 100 to 150 points<br/>
or so in the name a fashion :)  Another valueable post<br/>
from me, lol!<br/>
<br/>
OH!  I do remember dragonrealms too.  I was a warrior<br/>
mage there.  It was 9.95 a month but you could upgrade<br/>
to 29.95 a month to get access to better hunting<br/>
areas, and your own house.  Was a good game but the<br/>
people who ran it angered me to no end and I left when<br/>
an alternative came out (taps foot waiting for Anarchy<br/>
Online&#39;s release date).<br/>
<br/>
OH!  Something else I remembered while proof reading. <br/>
There was a post on whineplay from a bard complaining<br/>
about a stealth nerf on selo&#39;s.  Reports were<br/>
conflicting about it so I blew off that issue. <br/>
Yesterday I noticed selo&#39;s acceleration got noticeably<br/>
faster.  Kinda like someone broke something and just<br/>
fixed it maybe? /rude Verant<br/>

PS- I have 3 friends who are female barb shamen so I&#39;m<br/>
not anti-female barb, it&#39;s just not something I&#39;d like<br/>
to play. <br/>
