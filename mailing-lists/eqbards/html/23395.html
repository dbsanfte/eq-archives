<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615881467">Hehe when I was 46, I was running thru EC and saw someone selling SS gloves<br/>
for 1K.  I didn&#39;t have any SS pieces at the time so decided to buy them.<br/>
Later on that day I went to Karnor&#39;s for the first time.  Within 15 minutes<br/>
of entering the zone, SS gloves dropped off a dog that my group killed.  I<br/>
kicked myself in the butt for not having the patience to wait and loot the<br/>
piece for myself.  BTW Karnor&#39;s has been my main hangout since 46.  Since<br/>
that one incident where the SS gloves dropped 15 minutes into the camp, I<br/>
have not seen one piece drop.<br/>
