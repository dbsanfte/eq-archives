<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203534637">Say, I saw on the new patch message that Levitate has been changed back to allow<br/>
refresh while active.  This is because items now have a refresh time.<br/>
<br/>
So, the problem was that people could gain altitude by recasting.  Casters can&#39;t<br/>
get far &#39;cause they run outta mana.<br/>
<br/>
Did they check this on a Bard this time?   My guess, never occured to them.  I<br/>
assume we can now gain altitude just like we used to.<br/>
<br/>
Nice for us :)   Anyone know yet?<br/>
