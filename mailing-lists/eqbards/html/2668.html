possible.  Heck, maybe I&#39;ll create a newbie human agnostic<br/>
bard to check it myself.  49pp totally throws the consistent<br/>
results I&#39;ve gotten out of kilter, and if you match it to the<br/>
pattern I&#39;ve been observing, you should be able to sell it for<br/>
more than you bought it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem being the wood elf merchants are bugged.  They<br/>
view wood elves apprehensively, and nothing you do (other than<br/>
the Charisma song) seems to raise your faction with them.<br/>
<br/>
A racial modifier and cap on prices would not surprise me (so<br/>
maybe the 5% rule I found with combines only applies to wood<br/>
elves), but like I said, your 49pp figure doesn&#39;t fit the<br/>
pattern I&#39;ve found.<br/>
