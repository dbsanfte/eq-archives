<div id="ygrps-yiv-800527271">yes, absolutely.  acutally all the tanks at our raids are either barbarians<br/>
or ogres, so they don&#39;t need shields.  and when Vox gets low (15% or so)<br/>
everyone starts screaming STUN, and the clerics and wizards cast stuns only.<br/>
i have no sense of direction or zones, but i think we fight her on the ramp<br/>
to her lair.  wherever it is, it is near that rock that moves when you click<br/>
on it.  and avoid the bear pit at all costs unless you love difficult CRs.<br/>
for nagafen we fight him near the stairs to his lair.  also for both<br/>
dragons, we load up groups.  we don&#39;t balance them out.  my group is usually<br/>
4 tanks, a cleric and me.  maybe 3 tanks, 2 clerics, and me.  melee damage<br/>
is the key to killing them, not spell damage.  so you want to keep your<br/>
tanks alive, which means cleric and bard resists.  am i making sense?  i<br/>
usually just do what people tell me =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well on Vox the biggest thing is you must stop her from <br/>
&gt; healing.  Your tanks <br/>
&gt; need to be slamming/bashing like crazy.  That mean they give up that <br/>
&gt; secondary weapon and use a shield.  Nothing is worse then <br/>
&gt; seeing Vox down to <br/>
&gt; a silver only to have her get off a complete heal, <br/>
&gt; arrrrggghhhhhhhhh :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Since we are sharing ideas, we should start a thread on dragon<br/>
&gt; &gt;   ideas that work.  We cleared the whole cavern out except Vox,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   perfectly.  It&#39;s just Vox made an unexpected appearance.<br/>
