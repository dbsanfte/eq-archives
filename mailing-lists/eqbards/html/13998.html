&gt; &gt;Hehe, a rat in North Qeynos killed me.  Two times!  I gave up!  How did I<br/>
&gt; &gt;ever get 43 levels?  My god!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did you remember to equip your weapon Sylly? :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I started up a monk as part of a guild newbie event.  Since<br/>
the event was in Misty Thicket, it was recommended that we get<br/>
up to level 3 before making the trip.  In just under an hour,<br/>
I had to run from a half dozen rats, bats, and snakes without<br/>
getting any kills.  I&#39;ve started 2 other monks on different<br/>
servers, and I couldn&#39;t remember ever having this much trouble<br/>
getting out of level 1.<br/>
<br/>
Then as I was attacking another rat, I got the following<br/>
message:<br/>
<br/>
You have become better at hand to hand(1)<br/>
<br/>
Doh!  After that I was punching for 7-8 instead of 1.  :)<br/>
