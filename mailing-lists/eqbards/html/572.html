<b>Subject:</b> Travelling Services and Charging for Services <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266660375">As some of you may remember, I&#39;m one of the more outspoken advocates of never<br/>
charging for your services, yet I suggested to a player that they set up a<br/>
business running people from Freeport to Qeynos for 2 plat a pop.<br/>
<br/>
Am I a hypocrite?  Do I have poor memory?   Or am I just inconsistent?<br/>
<br/>
All of the above. :)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would never charge someone to recover their corpse.  This is<br/>
something that usually I can do in under 2 or 3 minutes, and it costs me nothing<br/>
but my time.   Sure, sometimes I will say no, either because I am too busy at<br/>
the time, or because where they died would be certain death, should I try to<br/>
find their body for them.  I guess the main reason I never charge people for<br/>
this is that it feels like I would be capitalizing on their misfortune.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, if I am headed somewhere, like from Kelethin to the docks, and<br/>
someone asks if they can hitch a ride on the bard express, no problem at all,<br/>
I&#39;m going there anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I look at running someone a great distance to be a different thing, particularly<br/>
if you aren&#39;t going there in the first place.  Just as a smith can and should<br/>
charge people with the intent of making a profit because of their talent, I see<br/>
nothing wrong with a bard charging people for a service they would be<br/>
hard-pressed to come up with elsewhere.  Nobody is making these people cross<br/>
Antonica, and if you can turn the trip from a dangerous hour long trip to a safe<br/>
20 minute trip because of your speed and invisibility songs and your guiding<br/>
experience, then I see no reason not to.  Nobody would just ask you out of the<br/>
blue for this service and expect it to be free, right?<br/>
