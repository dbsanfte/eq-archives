<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767893277">Kith rocks - who was the dweeb that titled this thread &quot;nerfed&quot;? (grins)<br/>
<br/>
I woke up at 4am and figured ok 2 hours to play... went to Kith and got into<br/>
a group. Memmed in purifying (party +MR), largo&#39;s (AE -atk speed), and<br/>
fufil&#39;s curtailing (Target DoT, -AC&lt;?&gt; and -MR &lt;?&gt;) Also had clarity (after<br/>
combat casters), lullaby (control more than 3 extra mobs), charm (one or two<br/>
extra mobs), hymn (after combat heals) & screetch (to chase off the trash<br/>
trains).<br/>
<br/>
My plan was to play purifying and largo&#39;s and DoT unless we need crowd<br/>
control.  The party was me 35 bard, a 36 sha-person, 33ish necro, 33ish sha,<br/>
33ish ranger, 31ish war.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, after a couple so-so pulls, we got one that required me to control a<br/>
dread wolf while the rest of them killed a rotting knight.  So, I charmed<br/>
the doggy and they killed the knight but we chewed up real bad.  The lower<br/>
sha was under a bub hp & OOM. The war was less than 2 bubs hp. The high sha<br/>
was lo mana. The necro was hurt - under half hp and lo mana.<br/>
<br/>
So I hold the doggy at bay while they med heal enough to finish the fight.<br/>
While I am charming the doggy, the hi sha starts in with &quot;play mana song.&quot;<br/>
And I tell him - no, I am gonna charm the dog and play mana later.  Then he<br/>
says &quot;just play mana song all the time.&quot; We try to have some more discussion<br/>
and all he wants is mana song - &quot;play mana song when mob is at half health.&quot;<br/>
Right, and what about these other mobs?<br/>
<br/>
So, after the fight,  the war goes wtf? no heals here??? I ask - ok who is<br/>
the healer.  Nobody answers.  I am not asking who should be the healer.  I<br/>
wanna know who &quot;knows&quot; it is their job to be healer. Nobody answers.  I keep<br/>
asking until the necro who is the group leader says well either of the two<br/>
sha&#39;s should be healer.  So, I ask one more time who is gonna be the healer<br/>
and again -- no damn answer. Thinking to myself - ok so we got not one but 2<br/>
wanna be wizards - enough is enough.  &quot;Good bye guys - nice to hunt with<br/>
you!  See you next time&quot; And I disbanded. <br/>
<br/>
The necro gives me a private tell and asks if i am mad or what.  So i tell<br/>
him that them sha&#39;s are too dumb and i dont feel like dieing for them and<br/>
nothing personal but they are not a good group. And about 10 min later i get<br/>
a tell from the necro say - they were nearly all killed.    <br/>
<br/>
*** For you innoruuk bards - send me a private email and ill send you the<br/>
name of the guy (non-healer shaman) for your &quot;Not to Group With&quot; lists. ***<br/>
<br/>
So, I was hoping to have something good to say about how well the Curtailing<br/>
worked to de-buff the undead and how well purifying worked to raise MR.  But<br/>
I did not get enough good time in to know.  Afterwards, I got into a 3 bard<br/>
group - me, a 33 bard, a 31 bard, and a ranger 33ish.  We were too weak and<br/>
too unbalanced to do very well and zoned alot but we knew that would happen.<br/>
<br/>
We did get a tough pull (tormented healer?) and it chewed me up first<br/>
(penalty of using charm to pull - it was frenzied on me). Then as i was<br/>
thinking of zoning, the 33 bard charmed it off me and we got hymn going.<br/>
Then it frenzied on him and they melee&#39;d it some more. Then when he was down<br/>
to 2 bubs, the 30 bard charmed it and by the time charm broke off, i was<br/>
back in the melee and we ended up beating it down.  Ping pong for bards &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kith is a really great place for bards -- fighting undead melee/casters -<br/>
it&#39;s hard to choose which songs to mem but the MR songs really shine!   <br/>

You&#39;re joking!  I went through Kithicor last night going from Freeport to<br/>
Qeynos and there was a red undead every 100 feet (and I&#39;m level 31 now).  I<br/>
rode the top of the zone wall like a frightened little schoolgirl.  Corpses<br/>
strewn all over the place.  It was sad.<br/>
