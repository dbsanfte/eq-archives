<b>Subject:</b> Re: Making coin at level 10 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103585699">Well I just turned level 11, and my guild said &quot;come to unrest&quot;, so<br/>
innocent me went along.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in my party was level 13 - 15 and like I said I was level 11,<br/>
we had 1 ranger, 3 mages and a wiz. The ranger and I tanked (mainly me),<br/>
while I twisted 3 songs (no lag). We must have fought about 3 hours,<br/>
with little down time. I made over 15 plat, got level 12, and made<br/>
friends with some high levels. Wiz&#39;s + Jig = Happy.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe try unrest, just watch out for the hag :)<br/>
