<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616002041">I thought I remembered at least two months ago that GZ said he was going to<br/>
release a song to us bards &quot;soon&quot;, before the expansion.  He said, &quot;I<br/>
really like this song and I am curious to see how you will use it&quot; and &quot;to<br/>
be used against casters&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Am I on crack and imagining this or what?  Did I miss something?<br/>
