<div id="ygrps-yiv-879941261">I am currently using the GeForce2 MX by Hercules (3D Prophet II MX) and<br/>
have been really happy with it.  They are going for about $149 at<br/>
Compusa.  You can also check out some great hardware reviews at<br/>

Get the best GeForce you can afford.  Currently, the 2 best<br/>
manufacturers<br/>
(IMHO), are Creative and Hercules.  Others may disagree...heh.  <br/>
<br/>
GeForce 3 is the newest and best out there.  If your budget is a bit<br/>
smaller, check out the GeForce 2 line.  Buyer beware!  Some of the<br/>
&quot;bargain&quot;<br/>
card manufacturers creatively label their cards such as they&#39;re not<br/>
untruthful, per se, but you could end up with a slightly different card<br/>
than<br/>
you thought you were getting, the difference usually being a slightly<br/>
different clock speed.  Do your homework, read some reviews, pick a<br/>
particular model, and don&#39;t look back.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I bought a GeForce256 DDR a little less than a year ago.  It&#39;s still a<br/>
superb card, I haven&#39;t found a game yet that&#39;s too much for it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Tallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not directly related<br/>
to<br/>
barding.  Bards do provide a lot of input into what is seen in game<br/>
graphically, so this can be an important topic.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 16 MB AGP<br/>
graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a<br/>
better<br/>
graphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram -<br/>
done.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards<br/>
they use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything<br/>
else<br/>
of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and some<br/>
places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t scrape<br/>
me<br/>
off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the help,<br/>
