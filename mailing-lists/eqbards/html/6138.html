&gt; &gt;From the discussions that we&#39;ve been having here on this list in the last<br/>
&gt; three days or so, it occurred to me that what we need is some sort of cross<br/>
&gt; reference of what songs stack with what.  I&#39;m only level 20 so it would be<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not too difficult, and I&#39;ve included these in the guide<br/>
I&#39;m writing up:<br/>
<br/>
L1 Chant of Battle does not stack with Antehm nor Guardian<br/>
Rhythms.<br/>
<br/>
L5 Accelerando overwrites other speed modifiers (SoW, Root,<br/>
etc).<br/>
<br/>
L6 Hymn *does* stack with regeneration spells if the spell is<br/>
cast before Hymn is started<br/>
<br/>
L9 Elemental Rhythms does not stack with Purifying Rhythms nor<br/>
the Psalm series<br/>
<br/>
L10 Anthem does not stack with Chant of Battle, speed increase<br/>
does not stack with enchanter&#39;s Quickness line of spells<br/>
<br/>
L13 Purifying Rhythms - see L9 Elemental Rhythms<br/>
<br/>
L15 Lullaby overrides enchanter&#39;s mesmerize line of spells<br/>
(this is actually a trait of all mesmerize - the shorter<br/>
overrides the longer)<br/>
<br/>
L17 Guardian Rhythms does not stack with Chant of Battle<br/>
<br/>
L19 Sonorous Clouding stacks but requires flute, and any<br/>
other song effect will let mobs see you.  Some question as to<br/>
how it mixes with invisibility to undead.<br/>
<br/>
L20 Binding attack speed decrease does not stack with Chain&#39;s<br/>
attack speed decrease (haven&#39;t tested it yet with enchanter&#39;s<br/>
spells)<br/>
<br/>
L23 Chain - see L20 Binding<br/>
<br/>
L25 Psalm of Warmth does not stack with Elemental or Purifying<br/>
Rhythms, nor other Psalm songs.  The fire shield I hear does<br/>
not stack with other fire shields.<br/>
<br/>
L27 Sirens will let you charm a mesmerized mob, which will<br/>
remain mesmerized (and thus useless)<br/>
<br/>
L28 Pixie Strike - see L15 Lullaby<br/>
<br/>
L29 Psalm of Vitality - See L25 Psalm of Warmth<br/>
<br/>
L32 Clarity supposedly *does* stack with multiple bards<br/>
singing it.<br/>
<br/>
L33 Psalm of Cooling - See L25 Psalm of Warmth<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s as far as I&#39;ve gotten now.  Stuff I&#39;ve heard:<br/>
<br/>
L36 Celerity does not stack with Anthem<br/>
<br/>
L42 Beserker Crescendo does not stack with Celerity<br/>
<br/>
