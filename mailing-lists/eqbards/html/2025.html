&gt; Sigh. After the last late night patch, I discovered the recently<br/>
&gt; discussed stacking of magic resist songs no longer works. <br/>
&gt; What&#39;s up with<br/>
&gt; that? Was this too powerful a benefit? Meanwhile, the <br/>
&gt; accellerando still<br/>
&gt; cancels sow when it wears off, as does levitate and of course the L30<br/>
&gt; song still doesnt work. Wish they would take a break from nerfing and<br/>
&gt; fix some bugs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also discovered with great joy that our music skills are <br/>
&gt; capped at 200<br/>
&gt; along with our combat skills. Guess I can&#39;t complain about <br/>
&gt; that too much<br/>
&gt; as even a warrior&#39;s combat skills cap at 200, and you&#39;d think the<br/>
&gt; warrior would be better at them than other fighters. But if that&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; case, why are the magic users still shooting up over 200 in their<br/>
&gt; casting skills?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A very depressed L41 bard. :(<br/>
