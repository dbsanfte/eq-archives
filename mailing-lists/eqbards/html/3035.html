&gt; &gt; So given a really fast computer, connection, and perfect<br/>
&gt; &gt; timing, you should be able to twist 4 songs and still have<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 seconds to spare. :-)  Hmm, maybe I should put a metronome<br/>
&gt; &gt; next to my computer...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Takes 3 seconds to start a song,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, I sat there and spent a half hour timing all this again.  <br/>
<br/>
From when I hit the song key to when I saw the song effect was<br/>
3.4 to 3.5 seconds every time.  This was even with giving you<br/>
the benefit of the doubt and starting my stopwatch late to<br/>
reflect client lag between when hit the key and when the<br/>
client sends the message.  Internet lag is a non-issue since<br/>
the time it takes for the client to send the song-start<br/>
message should exactly cancel out the time it sends the server<br/>
to send the song start message (which I *know* comes from the<br/>
server because I don&#39;t get it if I yank my Internet connection<br/>
and start a song).<br/>
<br/>
There was *one* time when it might&#39;ve taken only a second to<br/>
start, but I wasn&#39;t timing it because I was testing the next<br/>
thing:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; each song effect lasts for 10 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start up Accelerando.  When you see the &quot;faster&quot; message,<br/>
start your stopwatch and turn the song off.  When you see the<br/>
&quot;slow down&quot; message, stop it.  I got times between 12 and 18<br/>
seconds in about a half dozen timings, and when I&#39;m running, I<br/>
*always* slow down when I see the &quot;slow down&quot; message.  This<br/>
would indiciate that:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Incorrect actually. Restoration is not a healing song, but<br/>
&gt; rather a song that increases HP regen. It, like all other bard<br/>
&gt; songs, lasts for 10 seconds from it&#39;s start. It does not heal<br/>
&gt; on the pulse, the pulse just happens to be when HPs are<br/>
&gt; updated. So starting and stopping Restoration does nothing to<br/>
&gt; increase it&#39;s effect.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are partly correct, partly incorrect.  You&#39;re wrong in<br/>
that the song *does* heal on the pulse.  The song effects seem<br/>
to be tied to a 6 second heartbeat.  If you catch it right<br/>
before a heartbeat (I&#39;m guessing when your hp naturally<br/>
regenerates), the song will last just over 12 seconds.  If you<br/>
catch it right after, it will last just under 18 seconds.  In<br/>
all cases, it lasts 3 pulses, and the healing happens *on* the<br/>
pulse.  If you were correct and it didn&#39;t heal on the pulse<br/>
but rather increased your regen rate, you&#39;d get a fractional<br/>
amount between 2 to 3 pulses worth of healing from starting<br/>
and immediately stopping Restoration.  That doesn&#39;t happen -<br/>
you always get 3 pulses worth.<br/>
<br/>
You are correct in that you cannot exceed the maximum healing<br/>
rate of one pulse every 6 seconds.  If you try, you can see<br/>
your hp go up a second time, then immediately go back down to<br/>
match the original healing heartbeat.  It&#39;s like the second<br/>
instance of Restoration causes a incorrect early refresh, but<br/>
the server sends the correct info on the first instance&#39;s<br/>
heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You can&#39;t twist more than 3. And then with only a third of a second to<br/>
&gt; transition songs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I *have* twisted 4.  You need a fast connection and have to be<br/>
pretty accurate at guessing when the song effect will kick in.<br/>
With around 100 ms of lag, the 4th song ends just as or just<br/>
before the 1st song effect kicks in again.<br/>
<br/>
I think I now know more about how this song pulse thing works<br/>
than I ever wanted to know.  :-)<br/>
