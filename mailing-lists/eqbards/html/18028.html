<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130850819">Normally I use 1st person.  During fights I switch to overhead.  I only use<br/>
the butt shot view for swimming (try it sometime if your like me and have<br/>
trouble climbing back up on shore).  The other two views look behind me to<br/>
the right and left.  I use these when running to see if I&#39;m being chased.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to target with the keyboard, but that doesn&#39;t always work so I am<br/>
forced to use the mouse a lot.  Otherwise I only use the mouse for moving<br/>
items.  Songs, my movement, opening doors, etc is all keyboard.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] How do you play this game?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been playing computer games since Pong (yeah, I&#39;m that old).  My <br/>
&gt; coordination and reflexes were never that hot (which is why I <br/>
&gt; sucked at <br/>
&gt; sports), and they seem to get worse with age.  Plus, I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; usually played <br/>
&gt; turn-based strategy games.  And, in agreement with the &quot;can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; teach an <br/>
&gt; old dog new tricks&quot; axiom, I&#39;ve been playing this game in the default <br/>
&gt; first-person mode, using the keyboard for everything but <br/>
&gt; targetting MOBs. <br/>
&gt; (It took me until level 40 to switch from using the mouse for song <br/>
&gt; activation to setting up hot keys, which shows you how stuck in old <br/>
&gt; habits I can get.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering how the rest of you play.  Do you use the other <br/>
&gt; views, and <br/>
&gt; if so, for what purposes?  I&#39;ve been playing with the mid-range <br/>
&gt; third-person view for soloing for about a month, but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; having a lot of <br/>
&gt; trouble using it in group situations.  Does this just take practice?  <br/>
&gt; Does anyone use the &quot;behind the back&quot; view for any reason other than <br/>
&gt; aesthetics?  My avatar constantly gets in the way on that one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, do you use your mouse for movement?  Do you actually <br/>
&gt; feel that you <br/>
&gt; have better control than with the keyboard, or is this the <br/>
&gt; inverse of my <br/>
&gt; situation (e.g., you always used the mouse, so the keyboard seems <br/>
&gt; awkward)?<br/>
