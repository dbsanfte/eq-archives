&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, enough said ... this isn&#39;t an enchanter list after all =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;But it&#39;s good to know what other classes are capable of, though it can<br/>
&gt; &gt;make you even more annoyed at being told you are fine the way you are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually I just felt I was getting into my detailed enchanter-type<br/>
&gt;tactics that most people wouldn&#39;t care about! :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After being a bard for over 18 months and watching all my group<br/>
&gt;members, and even playing most of those classes to some degree, I feel<br/>
&gt;that I know enough of what other classes can do.  I&#39;m constanty amazed<br/>
&gt;at some people&#39;s reactions (even at 30+ and 40+) when I do things and<br/>
&gt;they didn&#39;t know I could do that.  Enchanter OR bard!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But it&#39;s important for us bards to know what others can do so we can<br/>
&gt;slot into a group and plug that little niche that isn&#39;t filled when we<br/>
&gt;join.  That&#39;s supposed to be what we&#39;re there for.  Allegedly.<br/>

about everyone&#39;s possible role in the group as it is them who are most <br/>
likely to die first in a bad group.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nothing like incentive to get to know the game better.<br/>
