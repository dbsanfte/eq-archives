&gt; Not really.  The mobs are programmed to react to combat in a pre-defined<br/>
&gt; manner.  If you&#39;re not doing anything to taunt the mob (ie, debuffing,<br/>
&gt; healing its opponents, etc), it&#39;s going to be based purely on the amount of<br/>
&gt; damage you are doing and your proximity.  Hence, if Player A is doing just<br/>
&gt; 5% more damage than Player B, with proximity being equal, and nothing<br/>
&gt; factored in except damage, the mob is going to focus on Player A.  I believe<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s John&#39;s point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes that was my point.  Kit&#39;s point is that variability in his<br/>
damage would make it so at 95% the ranger&#39;s effectiveness, he<br/>
would outdmaage the ranger more than 1% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
But in a way though, that just emphasizes my later point - you<br/>
just can&#39;t tell how effective you are relative to others via<br/>
this type of test.  You have to get in there and parse the<br/>
data to figure out average damage/time.  Then there will be no<br/>
question.<br/>
