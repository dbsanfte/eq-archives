<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995072970">there are a few reasons this is and a few more why it would have been exacerbated.<br/>
<br/>
1.  experience penalty.  paladin has 40%, necro has (i believe) 10%.<br/>
2.  necro can solo much more easily than a paladin.  how much of those 128 days were<br/>
      spent looking for a group?<br/>
3.  did he work on any trade skills like blacksmithing for his class armor?  these types of <br/>
      things are very time consuming.<br/>
4.  the paladin would likely have spent most of his hunting times in groups, which, unless it<br/>
      is a very good group in an uncrowded area, will not equate to the speed of soloing.  if you <br/>
      are in a group camping frenzy when there are 80 other people in lower guk, you will not be<br/>
      nonstop killing.  if you are fear kiting stuff in dreadlands solo you will be non stop killing (due<br/>
      to number of available mobs)<br/>
<br/>
there&#39;s probably other reasons like the time it takes to run back to the paladin&#39;s corpse, while the<br/>
necro can just bind where he is fighting.  or perhaps now that the paladin knows where a lot of the<br/>
good places to hunt are, he knows exactly where to take the necro for the best experience.<br/>

&gt;[The paladin] is lvl 54 now with 128 days played and well over 18 <br/>
&gt;months of hard core gaming. Sure he died quite a few times and many of them<br/>
&gt;before anyone even heard of a lvl 49 res, but I spent days with very little<br/>
&gt;exp movement after 45 or so. [The necromancer] on other hand has officially<br/>
&gt;passed [the paladin]up exp wise. Get this in 29 days played, 4 of those<br/>
&gt;camping Pyzin. I think I may have 1 or 2 days in group time, which cutts exp<br/>
&gt;in half at least. That adds up to less than 25 days to go from 1 to 54 for a<br/>
&gt;necro and 128 hard core cant leave your pc days for the pally. How can this<br/>
&gt;be right?<br/>

&gt;It&#39;s not just bards that have issues. I will really hate the loss of mezzing<br/>
&gt;and CCing things and see it as a major impact on my ability to contribute to<br/>
&gt;group survival/success.<br/>
