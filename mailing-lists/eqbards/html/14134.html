<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458933971">Since DEs have innate ultravision, I was always under the impression that<br/>
when you activated the DE illusion with the Mask of Deception that you were<br/>
supposed to gain this ability.  As a wood elf, I have infravision so can<br/>
normally see fine at night.  However, whenever I activate the DE illusion,<br/>
I&#39;m blind as a bat (i.e. I lose infravision and don&#39;t gain ultravision).  I<br/>
have had shamans buff me with the Ultravision spell and I have also had<br/>
magicians give me a Coldstone to equip so I know what Ultravision is<br/>
supposed to look like.  The difference at night when I have either of these<br/>
two buffs versus the vision I have with the DE illusion is literally the<br/>
difference between night and day.<br/>
<br/>
So is the Mask of Deception supposed to also give you ultravision?  I have<br/>
talked with enchanters who regularly cast the DE illusion spell on<br/>
themselves so they can see at night.  Is it possible that this component of<br/>
the Mask of Deception is broken?<br/>
