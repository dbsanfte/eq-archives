<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386597941">I agree.  I just don&#39;t see how our damage shield songs could possible help<br/>
them do their job better than extra strength or extra haste or extra dex<br/>
(for crits) etc. etc.  I just have not heard any convincing arguments for<br/>
why our damage songs would ever be the best choice for an additional song to<br/>
mix in.  Except from a few human monks who desperately wish to be able to<br/>
see in the dark.<br/>

There&#39;s a problem with that sort of argument, though.  If your primary goal<br/>
as a bard is to do damage in the group, you&#39;re missing out on well over half<br/>
of what the class can do that&#39;s more effective than adding more damage.  I<br/>
don&#39;t sing dots in a group, I&#39;ll leave the serious damage dealing to the<br/>
tanks and casters.  I&#39;d rather make them more able to do their jobs than try<br/>
to do it for them.<br/>
