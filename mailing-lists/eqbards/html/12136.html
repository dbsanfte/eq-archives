<div id="ygrps-yiv-828151805">HG population is greatest in Rathe Mts - head for Feerott zone and take the<br/>
next right passed the named bugs.  There&#39;s a plateau on the right just a<br/>
little ways into the zone.  Clear trash for HG&#39;s to spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Techniques seem good.  You wont beat Grim in a foot/feather race until 37ish<br/>
somewhere - maybe even more?  I can beat him now at 38/39 - didn&#39;t try much<br/>
before.  One time in 35 I think - pretty sure I was doing something foolish<br/>
like pulling Grim for a group cuz I had tracking and could find him and I<br/>
had to get creative as I was down to my last bub.  I hit charm and luckily<br/>
it stuck. I had pet guard here hotkey&#39;d and hit it. Then Selos again and<br/>
barely made the wood bridge. The party killed him before I got back for my<br/>
xp &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
