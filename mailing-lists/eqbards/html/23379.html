<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Portal in GD at the Dead Dragon??? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288197120">This is the portal to Sleeper&#39;s Tomb - the Veeshan&#39;s Peak of SoV. The key<br/>
comes from killing elder dragons and turning in their talismans to the ghost<br/>
of Jaled Dar (?) in Dragon Necropolis.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, not entirely a bard topic, but as collectors of information I figured<br/>
&gt; someone here would know.  Where does this portal go to and what is the key?<br/>
&gt; Also, I sure don&#39;t recall seeing this portal here when I was fighting there<br/>
&gt; a couple of weeks ago; and how the heck could I have missed that giant<br/>
&gt; spinning ball???  When did this get added?<br/>
