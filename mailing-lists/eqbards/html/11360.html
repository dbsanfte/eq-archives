&gt; ...  But you<br/>
&gt; are COMPLETELY wrong about GM&#39;s and Guides only helping due to a &quot;verifiable<br/>
&gt; bug&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I didn&#39;t complain that they didn&#39;t help me - but that they help everyone<br/>
&gt; else in that situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is my understanding that, other than the Planes of Fear and Hate, Verant policy is <br/>
to retrieve all player corpses that are unretrievable by the players.  The list of <br/>
&quot;unretrievable&quot; locations that I recall included:  below the world, in lava, at the <br/>
bottom of the ocean, and embedded in solid rock...<br/>
<br/>
Now, it&#39;s not necessarily true that a corpse in any of these locations is truly <br/>
&quot;unretrievable&quot;.  Before I even got Underwater Breathing song, I died in the Ocean of <br/>
Tears to a Specter onslaught, and was able to retrieve my corpse by Locating, diving, <br/>
swimming along the bottom while /corpsing, and coming up for air until I reached a safe <br/>
beach.  I&#39;ve retrieved corpses that appeared to be embedded in rock (e.g., they were <br/>
not visible) by Locating and /corpsing them.  I was also able to retrieve my corpse <br/>
from the lava in Solusek A.  Still, if a GM believes that a Bard should be able to <br/>
retrieve a corpse by using his abilities, the same GM should tell a warrior, et al, <br/>
that they need to find a Bard in order to do the same thing.  They shouldn&#39;t retrieve <br/>
SOME corpses and not others.  Either a corpse is retrievable by some means, or it is <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Note on the lava in Solusek A:<br/>
<br/>
The first time I fell in (yeah, I did this twice), I panicked, hit page up (so I was <br/>
staring at the ceiling) and floundered around wildly.  After losing two bubbles of <br/>
health, I found myself on solid ground.<br/>
<br/>
The second time I fell in, I figured it couldn&#39;t be that hard to get out, so I swam <br/>
around looking for the place where I had climbed out before.  Never found it, died.  I <br/>
could Locate my corpse from the staircase/landing, but could not get /corpse to pull it <br/>
up onto the ground, so I figured that I would use our Levitate song (pre-nerf).  It was <br/>
VERY difficult to get back out once I was floating over the lava; as far as I was <br/>
willing to explore, there is no place low enough to &quot;bump&quot; up onto ground, and the <br/>
walls are sheer, but I was able to manage it at the bottom of the staircase several <br/>
times.  It took me several minutes of attempting to climb out to manage it each time.  <br/>
(I had to try multiple times in order to get my corpse to a place where /corpse would <br/>
&quot;see&quot; it.)  I&#39;ve since been told that it was not necessary to drag the corpse out - <br/>
once targetted, I could have used the /loot command.  Not sure if this would have <br/>
worked.<br/>
<br/>
My conclusion is that it is realistically only possible to get a corpse out of this <br/>
lava (unless it is remarkably well-placed) if you have levitate, which is a pretty high <br/>
level spell for this level dungeon.  And even then, you probably also want group gate. <br/>
 (Note that, with our current song, this would not be possible; once you fell after the <br/>
third pulse, you would be in the lava, and the song will NOT raise you out.)  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure what sadist designed this dungeon.  ;)<br/>
