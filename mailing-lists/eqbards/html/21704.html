<div id="ygrps-yiv-486137278">Here&#39;s a potential copyright violation of my own (however I doubt Jason D<br/>
would mind).  I very interesting post about this topic on the EQ Vault&#39;s<br/>
board.  BTW - mea culpa (on blaming Verant for banning the wrong - person)<br/>
evidently - both the rape story and the sacrifice WERE from the same<br/>
individual (who was banned) according to a post on the Backstage Board<br/>

<br/>
Let me start with this. It really frightens me that so many of you have<br/>
quoted Verant&#39;s EULA as if it were an ABSOLUTE legally binding document, and<br/>
that you further defend it as being impenetrable, absolute, and Verant&#39;s<br/>
vanguard against any letigious action.<br/>
<br/>
I, in real life, actually AM an attorney, one who specializes in civil<br/>
rights and constitutional law. I&#39;ve also seen more than a few cases<br/>
revolving around business contract law and licenses, so this is an area I<br/>
can speak to effectively and knowledgeably. Before I continue, let me tell<br/>
you Mystere that if I in anyway had the time, I would represent you pro bono<br/>
on this case. However, I am currently far too consumed in other pro bono<br/>
cases to be able to give your worthwhile cause the attention it would<br/>
require, though I have passed this on to my firm and my local Bar<br/>
Association group in case anybody wishes to assist you. I strongly urge you<br/>
on your own to seek counsel on this matter.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let me start. First of all, Verant&#39;s inclusion of a clause saying that<br/>
they can ban or cancel an account for &quot;any reason&quot; is about as legally<br/>
binding as, well, it&#39;s absolutely NOT legally binding at all. I can&#39;t even<br/>
compare it to anything because it&#39;s ABSOLUTELY not enforceable. It&#39;s akin to<br/>
the &quot;we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.&quot; It&#39;s a scam, a hoax,<br/>
a thin veil that attempts to convince the reader that they have fewer rights<br/>
than they actually posess.<br/>
<br/>
This fact is compounded by Verant&#39;s continue modification of the EULA and<br/>
its forcing of you to click &quot;I agree&quot; everytime you attempt to play the<br/>
game. It&#39;s tanamount to civil extortion, and I don&#39;t know of a single judge<br/>
that wouldn&#39;t toss the entire EULA out in a civil trial.<br/>
<br/>
Let me restate this in simple terms. The EULA for EQ is bunk and is merely<br/>
there so that Verant can protect its intellectual property and to make you<br/>
think you have no recourse should they violate your rights.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to the story itself. Did Mystere violate Verant copywrite? Probably.<br/>
Is the violent nature of the story questionable? Possibly. Is there a moral<br/>
question that comes into play because the victim of the story is a minor?<br/>
Depends on your individual morals. Is the story pornographic? Doubtful. Is<br/>
it &quot;kiddie porn&quot; ABSOLUTELY NOT.<br/>
<br/>
As someone posted previous to this, fictional stories about fictional<br/>
characters that do not exist in real life do NOT constitute child<br/>
pornography....at least, not by federal statute, and not by California law<br/>
(which is relevent because that&#39;s where Verant is located).<br/>
<br/>
Even if it was child pornography, it doesn&#39;t allow Verant to cancel<br/>
Mystere&#39;s account. For one, Mystere&#39;s posting of this story and her legal<br/>
contract with Verant are mutually exclusive -- one has absolutely nothing to<br/>
do with the other. For another, it violate&#39;s Mystere&#39;s First Amendment<br/>
rights. As I said above, Verant probably has a copywrite infringement case<br/>
against Mystere, but since he in no way attempted to profit from this post,<br/>
Verant would have a difficult time proving civil damages in a civil court.<br/>
This by the way is Verant&#39;s only real recourse to Mystere&#39;s post -- bringing<br/>
her to civil court. In now way does it translate into a right by Verant to<br/>
severe a business agreement with Mystere, certainly not without explanation<br/>
or warning.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Mystere has two real modes of filing civil suits against<br/>
Verant. First, as a violation of her civil and constitutional rights.<br/>
Secondly, as a breach of contract for discontinuing a normal business<br/>
arrangement with her without cause or explanation in a manner that is both<br/>
arbitrary and capricious.<br/>
<br/>
Again, Mystere please seek professional legal counsel on this matter.<br/>
