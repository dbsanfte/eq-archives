<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536341485"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Color choice, like everything else, is highly subjective. Personally I<br/>
&gt; would have liked a black plate chest to go with my Rubi pants, then I<br/>
&gt; could have passed my chest on to our Rogue, who hasn&#39;t had the good<br/>
&gt; fortune to find one and can&#39;t wear plate at all. Our cleric is in a<br/>
&gt; mixture of Black and Red and it looks just great.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>true of course, but i love having a full set.  had full bronze, full steel,<br/>
and now full rubi, which i just love the look of.  i just hate those red<br/>
popsicle wisecracks =P<br/>
