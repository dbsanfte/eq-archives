<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736931892">Greetings Weiland,<br/>
<br/>
I am not an expert at making money, but I have a<br/>
friend who is.  Here is some of the advise that he<br/>
gives me.  I&#39;m not loot hungry so I probably won&#39;t do<br/>
it and it seems like you are not either, but it will<br/>
atleast help you get your banded.<br/>
<br/>
First of all make sure you are hunting a loot heavy<br/>
zone.  What I mean is since you are lvl 11, the best<br/>
place for you would be either Crushbone(Kelethin) or<br/>
Splitpaw (South Karanas) or of course the Derv camps. <br/>
I myself am not a big derv fan, because of all the<br/>
camping.  <br/>
<br/>
Next make sure you find a party that is high enough<br/>
level to not care about loot in that zone.  For<br/>
example find a party of lvl 16+ that will take you in<br/>
as an understudy.  That way they will  let you loot<br/>
practically everything that comes their way, because<br/>
they probably care more about the exp.  Make sure you<br/>
let them know, that these are your intentions.  This<br/>
is a an effective, but seldom used technique.  I have<br/>
done it a few times and I made about 15-20pp a night. <br/>
But it got old.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally don&#39;t leave out anything, sell everything.  I<br/>
have seen a lot of people get shoulder pads, or<br/>
legionnaire belts or rustys, and I&#39;ve seen them just<br/>
leave it on the corpse.  DON&#39;T!  It all adds up.  Just<br/>
keep collecting and selling, keep collecting and<br/>
selling.  It takes discipline, but in about 3-4 days<br/>
you will be able to afford a full suit of banded.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh and one last thing, if you are hunting in<br/>
Crushbone.  Make sure you sell at the Warror&#39;s guild<br/>
in kelethin, they give great prices.<br/>
<br/>
Ok I hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Farewell,<br/>

Hail and well met again,<br/>
    <br/>
    I am requesting the assistance of some of you yet<br/>
again.  Tonight I<br/>
finally made the 11th rank.  We were in W. Commons<br/>
killing the Derv&#39;s<br/>
when lo and behold a werewolf arrived and decimated<br/>
all but 2 of us,<br/>
myself and a ranger friend.  Upon zoning to E. Commons<br/>
and then<br/>
returning to the Bard&#39;s guild, I came to the<br/>
realization that I needed<br/>
&quot;real&quot; armor.  Up to this point, I have been wearing<br/>
all leather.  It<br/>
is affordable and light but is not as effective<br/>
against the Derv&#39;s and<br/>
such.  I NEED BANDED!!!<br/>
    And now on to my problem, where do I pick up the<br/>
plat to buy this<br/>
wonderful armor?  I seem to only make around 5 pp a<br/>
night at best. <br/>
Would joining a guild help me in this situation?  If<br/>
so does anyone no<br/>
any good guilds on Erollisi Marr?  I&#39;ve taken to<br/>
fighting darkweeds but<br/>
there is far too much downtime.  The orc cents in my<br/>
area have very<br/>
little loot, so soloing in this area is pretty<br/>
worthless.  The derv&#39;s<br/>
have lovely loot, but I am afraid of grouping with<br/>
people I don&#39;t know.<br/>
 Especially in a zone like W. Commons.  Tonight they<br/>
actually attacked<br/>
the werewolf!!<br/>
Yesterday someone in my group decided, despite my<br/>
warnings, to walk up<br/>
and slap Lord Shin Ree.  What should I do?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your advice,<br/>
Weiland of Freeport<br/>
11th Rank Bard of Erollisi Marr<br/>
