<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-608974754">In Northern Ro and Oasis there are already anti-camping Avatars for the derv<br/>
camps, they are called &quot;Sand Giants&quot;. Sometimes if you encounter very rude or<br/>
beligerent kill-stealing campers, you need but give the mighty avatar a bit of<br/>
direction toward the infidels. *smiles innocently*.<br/>
<br/>
Now if there was only a way to zone a Sand Giant into Unrest....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; After so many kills the Avatar of the creature comes. For example: Someone<br/>
&gt; is camping the Highhold orcs for 7 hours, looking for that particular item.<br/>
&gt; The party has killed NUMEROUS orc fanatics, each one a servant to the orcs<br/>
&gt; god. The god notices the death of &#39;its&#39; subject. The god sends an avatar to<br/>
&gt; destroy those that are killing his worshippers. In comes The Shralok Avatar.<br/>
&gt; It takes names. It kicks butt. If the party zones, he will disappear until<br/>
&gt; anyone from that party comes back to that area. After a certain length of<br/>
&gt; time, it is safe to come back and camp the area some more to get another of<br/>
&gt; a particular item. Until the avatar shows up again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its only a suggestion :) </span></blockquote></div>
