<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294578973"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Pray that the fallout from your raid is nothing like the one on Prexus.  The<br/>
&gt; good feelings from the raids (Vox, Nagefen and Fear all went down in a<br/>
&gt; period of 3 days) quickly turned into animosity, arguments, cries of<br/>
&gt; elitism, and just plain bad mojo.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It already has begun, sir.  People are crying about how they didnt<br/>
  get invited, and all sorts of crap.  Hell, even someone sh*thead<br/>
  from FoH posted saying Innoruuk server is a bunch of lame f*cks<br/>
  if they think beating Cazic means anything big.  FoH is just a bunch<br/>
  of lame pricks anyway.  Every server has this &#39;lame prick elite&#39; <br/>
  guild, you just need to avoid them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s only gonna get worse.  Granted, I&#39;m new to the L50 scene... but<br/>
  I&#39;m one of few L50 bards, so in a way I&#39;m kinda a new L50 in the bard<br/>
  area, which is lacking on Innoruuk.  So many L50s out there flooding<br/>
  up things.  Dragons wont live more than 24 hours these days.<br/>
