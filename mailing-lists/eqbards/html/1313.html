<div id="ygrps-yiv-970149835">Aye that was my plan.  I wanted to get a combine rapier so that I didn&#39;t<br/>
fall behind my friends who are purely monster killers.  I am also attempting<br/>
to become a smith. I am at 55 skill and haven&#39;t practiced in a while because<br/>
I have been saving for this weapon.  Arhghhhhh... its so annoying being<br/>
perpetually poor!  I have been so tempted to run off with my 42 plat and<br/>
power smith using the new control click method the verant guys have blessed<br/>
us trade skill peoples with.  Man I love that.  but I know that if I do I<br/>
will be so far behind my friends who are getting to levels where magic only<br/>
creatures are more frequent.  Ah well... life goes on. Thanks for the info<br/>
:)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was just curious... What is the average cost for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; barbed leather whip?  I hear they are quite good weapons<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I am interested in acquiring one.  I am currently up<br/>
&gt; &gt; to 42 plat.  I had the goal of saving for a combine<br/>
&gt; &gt; rapier... any suggestings?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll add that the combine rapier is a fine weapon as well.  I<br/>
&gt; dunno what changed, but the rapier graphic shows up correctly<br/>
&gt; on my character now (the bronze rapier I used to use showed up<br/>
&gt; as a dagger).  It is awesome.  With the Whistling Warsong or<br/>
&gt; Anthem going, it seems to swing with almost no delay.  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; originally bought it instead of a longsword (sold my old<br/>
&gt; combine longsword at-cost to a nice player who hadn&#39;t saved up<br/>
&gt; enough to buy it with his charisma) because my piercing skill<br/>
&gt; had been lagging behind, but after one night of use the rapier<br/>
&gt; is such an awesome weapon that I&#39;d recommend it over a<br/>
&gt; longsword. The combine rapier is the same price as a combine<br/>
&gt; longsword, and has a slightly better damage rate (5/23 vs.<br/>
&gt; 6/28).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My friends and I will be visiting Najena again soon, but even<br/>
&gt; if we do get multiple barbed whips, I think I will use just<br/>
&gt; one and keep the rapier in my other hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would say buy the combine rapier and use it to get a barbed<br/>
&gt; whip.  :-)  Lots of stuff in Lavastorm and Najena can&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; touched without a magical weapon.<br/>
