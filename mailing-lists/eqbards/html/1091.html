Giant Dervish Tuning Fork<br/>
Uses 2H Blunt Skill<br/>
13 31<br/>
Wt: 10.0<br/>
Tuning Fork<br/>
Race: Human, Woods Elf, Half Elf<br/>
Class: Bard<br/>
Magic: Can occasionally cast Chords of Dissonance in combat at the range of<br/>
a: RND DMG / L 13-31 CHR:100 bard equivelent<br/>
Gotten off a Hill or Sand Giant, Dervish Type.  The Giant Dervish&#39;s<br/>
instrument&#39;s are of such huge size they are of little use, and abandoned<br/>
with the bodies usually.  However some smiths of the gigantic races have<br/>
fashioned Tuning Forks, far too unwieldy as a weapon by anyone but bards,<br/>
whom by some divine ability can swing the things with the skill only a<br/>
musician can wield.   Foreign by the way it is weighted so heavily in the<br/>
bottom area, near the fist, ordinary practioner&#39;s of bashing skill find it<br/>
crude and ackward.  However, in the hands of a bard, innate musical<br/>
abilities give these individuals the power to swing it as a weapon, each<br/>
strike an ominously deadly chrous of a truly deafening melody.<br/>
       (:::The item has a high damage value, for the weapon is only valuable<br/>
as a &quot;last ditch&quot; weapon, the inherent spell effect of the weapon a<br/>
detriment in everyday hunting, most bards still relying on dual wield or<br/>
instruments:::)<br/>

Unicorn Horn Scimitar<br/>
Uses 1H Slash (using resource Glowing Unicorn Horn, only gives L Lightstone<br/>
light)<br/>
6 27<br/>
WT: 1.4<br/>
Unicorn Horn<br/>
Race: Any<br/>
Class: Brd, Pal, Ran, War<br/>
Magic: Casts a Greater Lightstone glow, combat Hymn of Restoration<br/>
<br/>
Only made from a smith with the average ability to create banded, using the<br/>
&quot;Glowing Unicorn Horn&quot; and sufficient ore to fashion a handle.  This Horn<br/>
can only be found on the corpse of a Unicorn&#39;s natural enemy, the Trickster.<br/>
Slaughtering (and not through predation) a unicorn for it&#39;s horn is an evil<br/>
act, and such evil goes into her horn itself, making that resource (Dark<br/>
Unicorn Horn) capable of making up an entirely different weapon.  The soul<br/>
of the unicorn itself can come from glowing yet still living horn, the<br/>
weapon virtually weightless (but for the smith&#39;s handle) and depending on<br/>
the wielder&#39;s Charisma, there is a random chance for Hymn of Restoration at<br/>
the level 14 Bard equivelent upon each swing of the weapon.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Dark Horn<br/>
Piercing (Using resource Dark Unicorn Horn, 15 Wt)<br/>
7 29<br/>
WT: 8<br/>
Unicorn Horn<br/>
Race: Any<br/>
Class: Brd, Thv, Shd, War<br/>
Magic: +60 Hide, +40 Sneak<br/>
Unusually heavy in one&#39;s hand, with straps of thick, polished leather to<br/>
give it grip, the thing actually makes a sphere of darkness around itself.<br/>
Created weapon by a tailor of the reinforced ability, along with sufficient<br/>
hides and a Dark Unicorn Horn.  Chopped from a freshly slain unicorn,<br/>
slughtered--harvested only for her horn itself: No matter who holds it, the<br/>
weight of the act follows the item like a consuming cloud, regardless any<br/>
virtue of the new owner.  The item itself is white, but heavy, and eerily<br/>
always in shadow.  So much so, an individual can hold out the horn and step<br/>
behind it, becoming virtually hidden from view.<br/>
      (::: The skill bonuses will not have any effect unless one has<br/>
actually learned the basics of either Hiding or Sneak:::)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just hoping for bard weapons, sorry they&#39;re only made-up<br/>
