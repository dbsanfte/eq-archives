<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514310910">Thanks.  As you say, it&#39;s only a bronze mace.  I&#39;m not going to petition to<br/>
get it back.  I&#39;ll probably just beat up the next decaying skeleton I see<br/>
with a cracked staff since I&#39;d only been using it for skill increases<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What worries me is if this is a code change where any time you die you&#39;ll<br/>
loose what&#39;s on your cursor.  I&#39;d like to say &quot;Verant would never do that&quot;<br/>
but I can&#39;t, and if I loose my gnoll hide lariat I&#39;ll cry.  Did anyone else<br/>
die since the last patch with an item on their cursor that the know<br/>
appeared in their corpse&#39;s inventory?<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Evulia, wondering if Selo&#39;s without a drum effect is fast enough to chase a<br/>
fleeing decaying skeleton<br/>

Talk to a GM, they will probably have you email someone specific. If<br/>
they refuse ask for the email anyhow. Explain the situation and<br/>
depending on what kind of day the person had you may or may not get it<br/>
back. I&#39;ve never gotten the shaft on lost item bugs before but people I<br/>
know have. However, not to be a downer, it was a bronze mace and they<br/>
may not deem it to be worth the effort. If you get past their lazyness<br/>
you aught get it back. Best of luck.<br/>

&gt; But I&#39;m pretty sure when I died last night I had a mace on my cursor.<br/>
&gt; I was still in the first bubble of a level which is when I always<br/>
&gt; carry blunt, slashing, and piercing weapons to get my skills up.<br/>
&gt; After looting my corpse, I just had slashing and piercing weapons. My<br/>
&gt; inventory was not full (not even the main slots, let alone slots in<br/>
&gt; containers) and in the past anything on the cursor at death has gone<br/>
&gt; into inventory.  I know I didn&#39;t drop it, I&#39;ve got item dropping set<br/>
&gt; on &quot;never&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So is this a bug or have I lost it completely?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Peace<br/>
&gt; Evulia, who accidentally sold her first bronze mace and has now<br/>
&gt; apparently poofed her second.<br/>
