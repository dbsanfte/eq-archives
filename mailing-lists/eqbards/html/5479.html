&gt; You&#39;d have to specifically want to go to the<br/>

&gt; can go on either side of them (between them<br/>
&gt; and the wall, or around the outside).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rathetear mountains were made to be the route<br/>
&gt; for evil races. =) Besides, even if they<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t, there&#39;s a good old thing known as<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll have to make the journey tonight with my Bard<br/>
alone just to check it out and get the path down<br/>
set. I&#39;ve heard the zone to Lake from the mountains<br/>
is easily missed. <br/>
<br/>
Second question, from a map of Lake Rathetear I&#39;ve<br/>
seen, it looks like the only way from one side of<br/>
the zone to the other (ie: Exit to exit) is by<br/>
swimming.. If this is in fact true, will there be<br/>
a problem with the deepwater goblins (or other water<br/>
nasties) if I swim around the edge just to get<br/>
from zone to zone?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for all the help. I love to travel<br/>
and these two zones are 2 of about 10 that I have<br/>
yet to be in, in some fashion or another.<br/>
<br/>
As for invisibility, I don&#39;t yet have it nor does<br/>
he. It&#39;s not always easy to find people willing to<br/>
help you out with that either; unfortunately.</div>
