<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467100548">Hate to be the realist here, but it really doesn&#39;t matter in the long run<br/>
what you prefer.  You will never find a high level group with a Ranger or<br/>
Druid using chains to keep runners from taking off.  High level players know<br/>
the limitations of the songs and few seconds or less that chains sticks vs<br/>
the 2 to 3 minutes that snare sticks is practically impossible to argue<br/>
with.  If you are in a high level group, there is no question as to whether<br/>
or not root goes away from the spell list or earth pets are replaced by fire<br/>
or water when there are snarers present.  These things aren&#39;t talked of,<br/>
just assumed.<br/>
<br/>
Chains effect rarely lasts 3 ticks.  If you get a single resist, especially<br/>
at higher levels, expect the MOB to start moving.  When it comes time for<br/>
the MOB to start running, you better not be trying to weave chains with<br/>
another song either.  In most high level dungeons your margin of error for a<br/>
runner is minimal.  A fire imp running on an efreeti raid doesn&#39;t need to go<br/>
far to bring h3ll down on your raiding party and even in deep paw, a gnoll<br/>
escapes out of a room into the hallway and you are toast.<br/>
<br/>
If your chains is in effect and snare is cast, it won&#39;t stick.  It takes a<br/>
druid or ranger long enough to recycle to be able to cast again that the<br/>
lost time could mean death as well.  Worse even, I&#39;ve seen bards (including<br/>
myself) press the wrong key and chain a MOB that is already snared... The<br/>
effect is to break snare and in a few seconds your MOB is suddenly on the<br/>
loose.  Have one of these things happen once and I guarantee a good group<br/>
with make you stop using chains or will disband from you.  You should go<br/>
talk to high level rangers or druids and ask them what they hate most about<br/>
bards... you&#39;ll find they all hate the bards that insist on chaining or are<br/>
convinced chains is better then snare.<br/>
<br/>
At around level 25 is when the good bards start getting set apart from the<br/>
bad bards and one of the traits of a bad bard is to tell other classes how<br/>
to do their job or try to fulfill roles that are clearly already filled by<br/>
another class in a party.  How many bards would pixie a MOB that an<br/>
enchanter mezzed?  I keep pixie up, but not as a replacement for mez, but<br/>
instead as a supplement for when it fails.  Same is true of chains.  Later<br/>
in life you will find it is a supplement in case the snare fails.<br/>
<br/>
Chains for pulling?  Depends on the situation.  There are a lot of places<br/>
where it works find but there are even more places where you will end up<br/>
pulling yourself a train.  In most dungeons, the pathing is so screwed up<br/>
that if you don&#39;t baby-step the MOB, it will end up running through doors<br/>
and rooms that you don&#39;t want any part of.  From my days in Sol A, we<br/>
learned quickly that you don&#39;t want to be SoW&#39;ed when pulling and you WANT<br/>
that mob stuck on your back... If it ain&#39;t there trying to stick a dagger in<br/>
you, chances are it has chosen some funky back-ass route that will end up<br/>
bring half the world down on your party.  Hope you have an evac&#39;er then or<br/>
get ready for CR.  The same is true of chains in these situations since you<br/>
NEED that mob glued to your back.  Puller&#39;s nightmare are casters.  The damn<br/>
mobs stop to cast on you and if you keep going chances are you aren&#39;t going<br/>
to like the path they chose to get to you when they go to catch up.  In<br/>
order to pull a caster correctly, you need to stop at every corner and wait<br/>
for the caster to catch up to you and expect to take a hit every time they<br/>
get you in line of sight.   You want an example?  Try pulling the Bar with<br/>
chains, or the little room next to the King&#39;s room in Sol A.   Heck, try<br/>
pulling the executioner&#39;s area in Paw with chains!  You are better off<br/>
running up and smacking the mob or using a throwing dagger then you are<br/>
using chains.<br/>
<br/>
My brother&#39;s character is a druid and I can&#39;t even begin to describe how<br/>
much better snare/fear works then chains/fear on the big stuff.  Especially<br/>
against larger MOBs where fear gets resisted.  A lot of the time fear lasts<br/>
a single pulse.<br/>
<br/>
You want a group friendly slowdown?  Use binding.  And no, it doesn&#39;t wake<br/>
up mezzed mobs.  Don&#39;t use either if you have a shaman with togors who can<br/>
get it to stick.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my bard and I love my songs, but I also know when<br/>
to use them and when not too.  I do everything I can to learn about the<br/>
other classes and their strengths and weaknesses so that I can make sure my<br/>
song line up augments a party instead of being a detriment.<br/>

&gt; Something else to remember:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once an NPC&#39;s health drops below 50% their resist rates seem to drop<br/>
&gt; dramatically.  I&#39;ve had mobs that resisted 100% all through the fight<br/>
&gt; suddenly resist 0% once their health dropped below the magic point (about<br/>
&gt; 1/3 bubble).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Generally during a fight I do the same thing as you.  Personally I prefer<br/>
&gt; Chains to snare anyday.  If the group insists on snare I just let the<br/>
snarer<br/>
&gt; know not to snare for a few seconds after the npc arrives to make sure my<br/>
&gt; chain (from pulling) has worn off.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I used Chains over Snare unless I was getting outrageous Chains resists.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The main reason is that I was the puller, and couldn&#39;t waste 2 slots for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack speed slowdown component.  As the puller, Chains was mandatory.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If I was having difficulty Chaining (determined early in the fight), I<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; yell, and the druid/ranger would proceed to snare.  As the mob got close<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; running health, I just chain Chained.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for mage pets, I don&#39;t usually stay in groups where the mage refuses<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; become group-friendly and summon a non-earth pet.<br/>
