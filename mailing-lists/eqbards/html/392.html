<div id="ygrps-yiv-942083685">Welp, all of the replies are true but I think you are not fully utilizing<br/>
the bard. The bard my be the second best soloing class there is. Im 20th<br/>
level now and still soloing. You may be playing the bard like a fighter that<br/>
occasional sings a song. Wrong. At 9th level go to Ro. Make sure you got a<br/>
full suit of leather. Armor is everything in this game. Get out your handy<br/>
guitar. Now see that scarab on the hill? Go punch it. Drag it back to the<br/>
grass area. Wince it twice (with the guitar), then switch to heal for one<br/>
pulse. Repeat. If you get down to 2 bars of health, run around in wide<br/>
circle till your health goes back up with the heal song on. And then do it<br/>
all again.  Make sure you are punching them while singing. I was soloing 3<br/>
scarabs at a time at 10th level.<br/>
Remember the bard is not a fighter to hack and slash. You dont have the hp<br/>
or ac to do it. You kill stuff slow, BUT you can kill more than one at once.<br/>
Now what other class can claim to do that?<br/>

&gt;Sorry if this has been addressed... I&#39;m finding level 9 to be<br/>

&gt;song - so all the orcs jump me.  I get killed instantly.  The rest proceed<br/>
&gt;to wipe out the rest as I memorize and work my way back.  Before I get<br/>
&gt;there - they all decide it&#39;s late and log off.  Not a one bothered to wait<br/>
&gt;and offer me a share of silver or loot...  Wasted about an hour and ended<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m under the impression now - I&#39;m better off pairing off with someone at<br/>
&gt;this point than trying large groups...  Large seem to take forever to do<br/>
&gt;anyting - and I&#39;m not getting much xp or loot..<br/>
