began, but hey we now have a tsuanmi.<br/>

As one of the moderators for this list I am disgusted by one of the <br/>
posts so the sender is banned, the post finished as follows . . .<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Robynn Merrilin, Bard of E&#39;ci<br/>

&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t lick something unless you really mean it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;             -Advice from the Naked Dancing Llama<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now I find the prospect of licking anything, not to mention a Naked <br/>
Dancing Llama, to be very offensive.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the upset that everyone feels over this descision but <br/>
much like VI we must all live with it or move on.  Very good points <br/>
have made on many boards and they are the place for this topic.  <br/>
Bottom line is we all feel VI was wrong for banning someone for <br/>
posting outside of their field of control and if it was a copyright <br/>
issue they should have filed in court not by terminating an account.<br/>
Lets move on shall we. . . <br/>
<br/>
good gaming to you all,<br/>

<br/>
ps: just kidding Katy, I actually find the theory of a Naked Dancing <br/>
Llama very intriging.<br/>
pss: I think I was just banned for moderating this list . . . oh well</div>
