<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886373768">Re the powerleveling bards thing: You&#39;re right, Harmonic. It&#39;s not easy. The<br/>
only one who I&#39;ve ever seen really able to do it well has been a monk<br/>
friend/guildmate of mine who is about 6 levels higher than me. He helps out<br/>
many of our guild members upon occasion in this manner. I wouldn&#39;t call it<br/>
powerleveling tho, as usually its just to get that pesky 1/2 bub to next<br/>
level. He&#39;s a great guy... the other nite he pulled birdies for me in Aviak<br/>
City and beat them down to near death, then feigned and said, &quot;get it&quot; and I<br/>
finished them off, got exp, and he even let me loot (saving up money for the<br/>
day I can go get my lambent). Made short work of the last 1/2b of L23,<br/>
that&#39;s for sure! :)<br/>

&gt;   I noticed that a L50 cleric was trying to powerlevel a bard<br/>
&gt;   the other day.  Needless to say, I&#39;ve seen very few bards<br/>
&gt;   powerleveled.  It&#39;s not an easy thing to do.  Most powergamers </span></blockquote></div>
