<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140526478">Once a friendly fellow gave me 1pp to take him from the docks to Kelethin.<br/>
Another time I accompanied a Euridite and he gave me a binding in exchange.<br/>
And that was only for a few zones.  Such a service could be set up for<br/>
Kelethin easily!  Just return to the docks every 14-16 game hours.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve escourted folks from Freeport to Qeynos before, and only last night<br/>
this foolish Lv5 mage wouldn&#39;t follow me through the commonlands properly<br/>
(he seemed to trust the roads more than my experience).  This irritated me,<br/>
of course, because he was wasting my time and taking an unnecessary risk.<br/>
He also disobeyed my instructions to -never- engage in any combat and was<br/>
killed in the Gorge.  There I was, tapping my foot and wielding a<br/>
drum--being wacked by three goblins, just waiting for him to run on ahead so<br/>
I could follow.  No.  First he stood and watched a while as I screamed,<br/>
&quot;GO!&quot; and &quot;Run!&quot;  He then decides to cast a few spells; I knew he was<br/>
doomed.   For this reason I would advise taking payments in advance (require<br/>
at least half) and not making any guarantees to anyone&#39;s safety, stipulating<br/>
you can only make such a guarantee if the client follows your instructions<br/>
EXACTLY!  Simply too difficult to save someone if they make it difficult for<br/>
you through sheer stupidity.<br/>
<br/>
First rule should be, we are travelling and not fighting!  Perhaps insist<br/>
everyone sheath their weapons even. Then explain that they will avoid<br/>
anything as long as they don&#39;t stop, not to fear anything because they are<br/>
faster than any creature on Norrath.  So many people stop and nervously<br/>
stare when they spot a Hill Giant.  They are safer if they just keep moving.<br/>

&gt;Jyzan mentioned in an earlier post that during the beta, a few bards were<br/>
&gt;offering their services to travellers wishing to speedily travel from<br/>
&gt;Freeport to Qeynos.  They were charging 1-2 PPs per person.  That sounds<br/>
&gt;like a great alternative for making some cash other than the standard trade<br/>
&gt;skills and adventuring.  What does everyone else think?  Is this a viable<br/>
&gt;way to make money?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am fairly new to the game and have not ventured anywhere other than on<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;country travel on other continents.  I am also unaware of how long it takes<br/>
&gt;for another class (at standard movement rates) to travel from Point A to<br/>
&gt;Point B on the other continents.  Do you guys think that other players, in<br/>
&gt;order to maximize their adventuring potential by decreasing travel times,<br/>
&gt;would be willing to pay for this service?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If we agree this is a viable service, I was thinking that we could use this<br/>
&gt;forum as a place to agree on standard service rates from Point A to Point B<br/>
&gt;for each continent.  I will consolidate all the recommendations I receive<br/>
&gt;and publish a list that everyone can use if they wish to perform this<br/>
&gt;service.  Of course, like all other services, final prices would still be<br/>
&gt;negotiable and subject to the supply/demand laws.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, in order to make this work, bards will have to start advertising the<br/>
&gt;service to their fellow players.  Amazingly, I grouped with some guys the<br/>
&gt;other day, all 8-10th level, who had never travelled cross-country with a<br/>
&gt;bard before.  We started in Kelethin and went to the Mino caves in<br/>
&gt;Steamfont.  They were amazed at how fast we got there.  Everyone made a<br/>
&gt;comment they were glad to have me in the group.  They were even more<br/>
&gt;gracious when we had to start fleeing from some Mino slavers:-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me know what you think, both positive or negative.<br/>
