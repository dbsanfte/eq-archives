<div id="ygrps-yiv-451435153">As a Bard that loves to be a part of the economy, I&#39;m considering getting<br/>
more into a few skills (I&#39;ve found Blacksmithing to be frustrating and very<br/>
expensive. My current skill is at the point where I get to do Scalar molds..<br/>
woopydoo). My two interests are Tailoring (love giving newbies free<br/>
patchwork armor) and Baking (love making use of all that free meat).<br/>
<br/>
In tailoring, I know the basics of patchwork armor - ruined wolf, cat and<br/>
bear pelts. MQ or HQ pelts for backpacks and studded/reinforced armor, but<br/>
there are some furs that I haven&#39;t seen a use for that I&#39;m curious if anyone<br/>
knows about. Black Wolf Fur (not ruined, med quality or high quality - just<br/>
black wolf fur) and Rat Fur. And how about Deathfist Pawn orc scalps? Can<br/>
tailors make anything with the above types of furs? Are there other furs<br/>
that can be used in tailoring? I have purchased the Tailoring book and the<br/>
how-to-sew books, but none of them mention the above.<br/>
<br/>
In baking, can any meat be mixed with bread to make sandwhiches? Is a spit<br/>
sort of like a portable oven? I&#39;ve purchased the first delicicies book and<br/>
just can&#39;t imagine buying 10 baking books for recipies.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any web pages that do a very good job of describing the above<br/>
two skills, I&#39;d very much appreciate it. My Bard is looking for knowledge.<br/>
I&#39;d considered jewelry, but I believe it&#39;s just way too expensive. Tell me<br/>
if I&#39;m wrong.</div>
