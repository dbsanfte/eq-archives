 </span></blockquote>You are probably right about them getting out of sync but I&#39;ve even seen<br/>
it happen with Selo&#39;s. I&#39;ve had the fading of the SoW icon actually slow<br/>
me down while playing Selo&#39;s. I think it was back when Selo&#39;s would<br/>
override SoW but the icon stayed up. When the icon for SoW faded I<br/>
actually slowed down until the next Selo&#39;s pulse, dispite the fact that<br/>
SoW had been overridden.<br/>
