<b>Subject:</b> Soloing EW questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-545744219">OK, gonna drop the beans here and admit it, I suck at soloing.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be versatile and be able to do all the class can do (which in our <br/>
case is a whole lot)... so..<br/>
<br/>
Am currently 37, was going to wait to solo until I got chant of <br/>
flame...  but maybe I can get 38 in EW?<br/>
<br/>
I have MM drums and decent equipment, but nothing outrageous.<br/>
<br/>
What do you solo there and what techniques, I&#39;m very veyr interested.  My <br/>
wife&#39;s sick to death of OT and is going to drag her warrior over to velious <br/>
soon, so thought this would be very pertinent info for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time,<br/>
<br/>
