<br/>
Today I come to you with a small request.  I view all bards as family, server be damned, but in order to all communicate fully amongst the various realms of Norrath we need outside assistance.  In answer to my prayers, Flayme Dancer of Fennin Ro has brought us the EQ Bardic Guide database.  Please fellow song weavers take the time to submit your character info to this fine website.  In the end, it will bring us all just a little bit closer together.<br/>
The address is:<br/>

<br/>
Once again, please take the time to submit your information.  Tell him Weiland sent you!!  He will be happy to see all responses.<br/>
<br/>
(And no I am not affiliated with this website in any way, I just really thought it was above and beyond the All EverQuest Sites from a bardic perspective.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time,<br/>
<br/>
Weiland of Freeport<br/>
