	I personally have not found a decent map of Lower Guk dead side that<br/>
indicates any of the rooms. One of the best sites for maps that I have found<br/>
is the following:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/indexe.html">http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/indexe.html</a><br/>
<br/>
	Most of it is in Japanese and there are few points of interest marked on<br/>
the maps but as far as finding your way around it is damn near perfect.<br/>
<br/>
	I also do not know where the Assassin is but people who hunt the Supplier<br/>
also seem to hunt the Assassin at the same time so they must be relatively<br/>
close. On Maps&#39; Guk Bottom Dead Side the Basalts are in the area with the<br/>
&#39;A&#39; and the Supplier is in the square room above the &#39;To B1&#39;. I&#39;d guess the<br/>
Assassin would be somewhere between the &#39;To B1&#39; and &#39;C&#39; maybe.<br/>
<br/>
	Another good spot for maps is this place:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.medvecky.com/EQ/NOREQMaps.htm">http://www.medvecky.com/EQ/NOREQMaps.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
	This is basically a collection of different maps from different people<br/>
including many from the Japanese site above. I don&#39;t think any original maps<br/>
exist here.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

I have a boon to ask of ye, me friends.<br/>
I have need of a better map to the ruins of lower Guk. The maps I have found<br/>
from the many cartographers around fail to lead me true.<br/>
Any help you may offer in this manner would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
-Martyn<br/>
<br/>
[OOC: The maps out there that I have found fail to show the Assassin room. I<br/>
would love to be able to get there, or near, to get a basalt Carapace to<br/>
wear (and perhaps one of the new masks)<br/>
I was in lower Guk much of last night, and both were up for free loot, but I<br/>
could not find a guide to the assassin room. by the time I did find a guide<br/>
(a few hours later), There were only 20 people in the zone, and bad things<br/>
were everywhere. I did get greaves and gauntlets. Much better to wear than<br/>
bronze]<br/>
