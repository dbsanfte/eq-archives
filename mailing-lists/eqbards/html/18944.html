<div id="ygrps-yiv-941838463">There&#39;s another type of helpfull guild as well.  My<br/>
current guild is made up of a small tight knit group<br/>
of folks who all help each other out.  If an item<br/>
drops that someone else (even if not in our group) can<br/>
use or needs it goes to him or her no questions asked.<br/>
 In Unrest last week our group got 2 opalline earrings<br/>
and the 4 of us from our guild gave up part of our<br/>
share of loot to buy them from the group to give to<br/>
the guild&#39;s enchanter.  Its help like that, that<br/>
really makes the game fun. :)  (Also keep in mind on a<br/>
new server there&#39;s a LOT more fun from generic<br/>
everyday items to be had...bronze is still appreciated<br/>
as a gift. :)<br/>

I would never join a guild for the sole reason of<br/>
getting nice items for free.  I have nothing against<br/>
people helping other people out, but I believe there&#39;s<br/>
a lot to be said for being able to acquire my<br/>
equipment by my own means.  Singing Steel Boots aside<br/>
(which I mentioned I received as a gift), the only<br/>
other item I have which I did not a) loot, b) buy, or<br/>
c) trade for myself is an EB BP and I feel I&#39;ve been<br/>
pretty well equipped throughout the life of my Bard. <br/>
When I received the BP as a wedding present, I was<br/>
capable of gaining it myself by a), b) or c).<br/>
<br/>
I see my guild more as a means to help me get to the<br/>
places to acquire equipment rather than a guild that<br/>
will take all of the work out of it.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
twinking (my level 10 Shaman has almost full Totemic),<br/>
but I still take some pride in having acquired that<br/>
equipment myself in another character.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen and heard of far too many guilds, for my<br/>
taste, where people join for the sole purpose of<br/>
getting twinked.  Level 10 characters join and demand<br/>
&quot;phat lewt&quot; or they threaten to quit.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m more of a &quot;loner&quot; or maybe, even tho I have<br/>
given away many items to people, I don&#39;t want to feel<br/>
obligated to reciprocate every time I get something of<br/>
value on my own.  But, whichever reason, I&#39;d<br/>
definitely prefer to purchase, trade, or loot the<br/>
Singing Steel Gaunts on my own.<br/>
