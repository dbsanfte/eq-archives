<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869804190"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;But for the first time since I got the speed<br/>
&gt;song, something odd happened.  At level 30, with the<br/>
&gt;Mistmoor Drum, I was getting hit from behind.  A lot.<br/>
&gt;For 30-50pts each.  That was a new and frighting<br/>
&gt;experiance.  I&#39;m hoping it was a bug.  Zoned out with<br/>
&gt;half a bubble and a racing heart.  Anyone else take on<br/>
&gt;these little inviso guys?  I hear there&#39;s more stuff<br/>
&gt;now in our spooky liitle woods, can anyone verify.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, to confirm your nightmare, it&#39;s no bug.<br/>
I have been testing the skills of these shadowmen for the<br/>
past few days.  Level 35 + MM drum, and they still overtook<br/>
me, which absolutely confirms these creatures have SoN on.<br/>
(since I&#39;m faster than SoC now).  However, you as a *bard*<br/>
have a defense, that no others have...<br/>
<br/>
Me and a level 36 druid decided to check these little guys out.<br/>
I got them on track in South Karana and headed over that way.<br/>
They are invisible until you are almost on top of them, at which<br/>
point you can see their name tags.  At level 35, two of the six<br/>
conn&#39;d high green, then others all blue.  High green at level 35<br/>
is equivalent to level 25.  My guess is these shadowmen are minimum<br/>
level 25 and range up to level 30 tops.  (that is just a guess btw)<br/>
<br/>
So we carefully scope them out, all warriors it seems.  And then<br/>
we get a little braver, and approach them.  They scowl, ready to <br/>
attack -- but do no such thing.  They are not aggressive.  The <br/>
druid attempts to pull one from the crowd, and I stand ready to <br/>
assist.  Instantly, all six shadowmen are on him... and he is<br/>
steadily losing life, decides to personal gate, and eventually<br/>
makes it.  I was stunned at what happened, but due to bard hate<br/>
I was instantly swarmed...  40 dmg, 50 dmg, double attacks.  ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Screw this, I&#39;m outta here -- see ya fools!   &#39;click&#39; Accelerando.<br/>
DOH!  Shit, the druid SOW&#39;d me!  &lt;sob, sob&gt;  (later to find out<br/>
I couldnt outrun them anyway)  I was about to pull a Plane of Fear<br/>
manuveur:  Find a safe, easy to locate spot and curl up to die.<br/>
<br/>
Not today, fellow bards =)   Brass Horn to melee slot 2, &#39;click&#39;<br/>
Screech.  Six shadowmen vanish in terror...  /shout shadowmen to <br/>
bridge!  I make a run for it.  A few seconds later, the are on<br/>
me again, damn they are fast.   2 or 3 flee, &lt;laugh&gt;  and I&#39;m<br/>
still making a run for the bridge...  A few more return, only<br/>
to be scared away by my pitiful brass skills.  I almost reach <br/>
the bridge, and everything is calm.  They didn&#39;t follow me any<br/>
further.  I speculate that since I had SOW and I was fearing them<br/>
in the opposite direction, that we were spanning the zone at <br/>
tremendous speeds, thus a time was reached when I exited their<br/>
chase radius and they returned home.<br/>
<br/>
MotS:  Screech, never leave home without it.<br/>
