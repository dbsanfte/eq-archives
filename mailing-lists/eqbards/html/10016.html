&gt; I was under the impression that Instill Doubt was broke in that you could<br/>
&gt; not raise in skill by using it...I used it for two sessions in Highkeep at<br/>
&gt; one point for about 4 hours total getting 2 successful fears and no skill<br/>
&gt; increases, maybe this is fixed or maybe it is just tough to get going.  At<br/>
&gt; any rate, good to hear that you are actually increasing in it.  I think mine<br/>
&gt; is still sitting at around 9 skill points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its just really, *really* tough to get going.  It&#39;ll only frustrate you trying to get it<br/>
to increase in the single digits by practicing it.  I recommend taking all those<br/>
useless training points you have sitting around and pumping as many as you<br/>
can into instill doubt.  Once you get it in the 40s, it starts moving a little quicker,<br/>
and once you hit 60 or so you&#39;ll be getting skill increases reasonably often<br/>
(Just be careful what you practice on - I started more mini trains this way when<br/>
totally out of the blue my kick would land and the fear spell would actually<br/>
work...)<br/>
