With all due respect, this is why some jerks ask 100+pp for Lambent stones-I<br/>
paid 10pp for a Lambent, the other 2 I have gotten so far were given to me.<br/>
I refuse to pay more than 20, but when other bards pay 50, 60, or more for<br/>
one it makes it harder to get the message across.<br/>
My advice to you would be to be patient, you will find them for 20 pp, or I<br/>
believe there are enough kind souls who will /shout looting rights to one.<br/>

&gt;I payed 60pp for a Lambent stone last night (was asking 100pp), I also got<br/>
&gt;myself 2 sapphires and now all I need is the rune from Choon in WK. Anyone<br/>
&gt;know hard this is to get, bearing in mind I am only level 27. My friend<br/>
&gt;will help me kill him (level 28 Mage) so I think we could take him, can<br/>
&gt;anyone tell me how hard Choon is to locate??<br/>

&gt;Agreed. I know a lot of rogues on E&#39;ci have banded together and refused to<br/>
&gt;purchase Ravenscale armor from anyone.  20PP seems like a fair price for<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;lambent stones so thats as far as I will go.<br/>

&gt;&gt; It&#39;s unfortunate that the higher level bards are dumping money on these<br/>
&gt;&gt; such that us lower level bards.  Wish we could somehow spread the word to<br/>
&gt;&gt; not pay that much for these things.<br/>
