<div id="ygrps-yiv-572371636"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;       Lately, I&#39;ve been grouping with druids who get pissed off when<br/>
&gt; &gt;       I&#39;ve chained and they can&#39;t snare, or when my chains break their<br/>
&gt; &gt;       snare, so I&#39;m thinking of reviving this one.  As for the attack<br/>
&gt; &gt;       speed and AC adjustments, I&#39;ve never noticed any tangible<br/>
&gt; &gt;       benefits.  Currently never memorized.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bah - as long as you keep it Chained, why should they<br/>
&gt; complain?  Chain is superior to snare because it slows down<br/>
&gt; attack speed.  It&#39;s also a pretty good taunt, and ask any<br/>
&gt; healer - they&#39;d rather the bard in banded/plate be taking<br/>
&gt; damage, not the druid in leather.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, a bard cannot be trusted to keep something chained. Things<br/>
sometimes resist (just once) and boom, they&#39;re around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a snarer in the group, the bard should /not/ be using chains<br/>
unless you don&#39;t mind runners. Where I adventure, one runner means evac or<br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the chains act as a major taunt, which is sometimes good but<br/>
not always. A snare is a very weak taunt. A ranger/druid can snare a mob<br/>
and never have it aggro on him very easily. Additioanly, snare (NOT<br/>
ensnare) last a guaranteed, set time varying with level. Once they&#39;re<br/>
snared, there&#39;s no chance of that mob breaking free until that set time<br/>
has passed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; 23 -- Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain.  Great &quot;taunt&quot; and as a bonus, it can be<br/>
&gt; &gt;       used to snare runners if you don&#39;t have a snare caster in the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s better than relying on casters to snare/root because you<br/>
&gt; can chase mobs while singing this song - they can&#39;t while<br/>
&gt; casting snare/root.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s MUCH better to rely on casters to snare. Why? Because chains has<br/>
to be cast while the runner is trying to run -- one failure and it&#39;s time<br/>
to evac. Snare can be cast on all the mobs at the beginning of the battle,<br/>
without making the mobs attack the snarer. You then no longer have to<br/>
worry about mobs escaping. <br/>
<br/>
So, to summarize.. snare can be cast /before/ mobs try to run, without<br/>
getting the attention of an engaged mob and is reliable.<br/>
<br/>
Chains must be used while the mob is trying to run and has multiple<br/>
chances at resist. One resist and it&#39;s evac time. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, if there&#39;s nobody who can snare in the group (rooters only),<br/>
then chain away. =)<br/>
<br/>
But a bard who chains snared mobs is likely to get kicked out of many<br/>
groups after getting them all killed a few times.</div>
