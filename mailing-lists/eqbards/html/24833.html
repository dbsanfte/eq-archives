<div id="ygrps-yiv-400314679">When we get duel weild will we be able to play an<br/>
instrument and use a weapon at the same time? Has<br/>
anyone maxed out their hand to hand before<br/>
getting duel weild? And when does song weaving<br/>
come into effect or is it something that just<br/>
gradually comes into being as we level? And<br/>
lastly, what would you say our very most<br/>
important stats are in order? Thanks in advance<br/>
for any help! =)<br/>
