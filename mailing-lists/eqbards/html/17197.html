<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278596948">Maybe the mob that drops the lute *is* her.  Maybe she changed her name when<br/>
she went over to the dark side.  Would make sense that that lute has *some*<br/>
use.  Sorry, wild conjecture here.<br/>

I thought Metala was in Mistmoore some time ago, least that&#39;s what I heard.<br/>
I was under the impression she was no longer in Mistmoore however.  Maybe<br/>
someone just assumed that the mob that drops the lute of the gypsy princess<br/>
was her?<br/>
