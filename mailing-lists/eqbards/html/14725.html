<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043916525">Hehe, the good ole days &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a story from the bad new days:<br/>
<br/>
When we were exploring lower guk on a night when it was so camped you could<br/>
wander around without invis to undead, we had poked around the undead tower<br/>
some.  I was standing kinda near the assasain ladder saw this dumb caster<br/>
come running across the bridge with a GIBS train in tow. Hehe, training into<br/>
the tower instead of out of it?  Like I said she was dumb.  So, I figured<br/>
well, what the heck, and stepped in to stop that train.<br/>
<br/>
I chained a GIBS, yelled for my group, hit auto-attack and started to<br/>
screetch. All but one GIBS fled back to their cave.  My group arrived and we<br/>
hacked down the gibs. Then the other 4 GIBS came back and attacked us.<br/>
Chain, fear, assist on me!  Dont chase them!!! Rinse, repeat.  We nailed all<br/>
of the GIBS - hehe. And were lucky that the caster frogs to the side of the<br/>
bridge did not spawn during our fight.<br/>
<br/>
Try that today and someone will prolly yell at you that they were &quot;pulling&quot;<br/>
those GIBS to the Lord room for something to kill between spawns &lt;g&gt; and<br/>
accuse you of KS&#39;ing.<br/>

&gt; When we were first exploring lower guk, back when there was 8-10 ppl in<br/>
&gt; the zone, I used lullaby at least once on an over pull in the undead<br/>
&gt; tower. It worked and we all lived.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Another time we had an over pull (again in the undead tower) and I fired<br/>
&gt; up screech to try to get 4 mobs off our druid so he could get off an<br/>
&gt; evac. The train that came back 15 sec later with the feared frogs was<br/>
&gt; the scariest I&#39;d seen there. We got all the gargoyles and every other<br/>
&gt; frog in the tower too. Heh. Didn&#39;t last too long. </span></blockquote></div>
