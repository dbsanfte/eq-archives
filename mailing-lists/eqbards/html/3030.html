<div id="ygrps-yiv-431843301">ok here is my experience on what gives bonus to dmg:<br/>
<br/>
Level 20+<br/>
Strength 100+<br/>
Increased skill points in that weapon type<br/>
<br/>
Last night i hit for 50 with my crystalline blade (dmg 11), i was quite<br/>
shocked, but that is my best hit to date.  this is with 113STR plus level 49<br/>
shaman strength buff plus level 50 song, which put me close to 200 or so.<br/>
once you hit 20 you may not notice much, but the higher your level and the<br/>
higher your skill, the more you will hit for.  i can easily hit for 4* dmg<br/>
or more with 200 skill in 1h slashing and 1h blunt.  plus i think your<br/>
primary hand will hit harder than your secondary.<br/>
<br/>
so it takes time but you will start to notice as you get higher above level<br/>
20.  and even though your song gives you 102 str, i would try to get some<br/>
strength enhancing items if you have the money (easiest 6 STR you can get<br/>
are 2 golden amber earrings, which i think go for 80 to 100pp for the pair).<br/>
i don&#39;t know your level so i don&#39;t know when you will be able to afford such<br/>
items.  some items i have that enhance strength are:<br/>
<br/>
Golden Amber Earrings +3STR each (~100pp pair)<br/>
Silver Ruby Veil +4STR +4WIS (~200pp)<br/>
Jagged Bands 5AC +3STR each (~150pp each)<br/>
Purity Belt +2STR +2STA (~15pp)<br/>
<br/>
i think some lower level items are the spiked collar +3STR, flesh bands<br/>
+2STR each, and the purity belt.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since you are a bard I hope you can answer this question for <br/>
&gt; me.  What level<br/>
&gt; did you see an improvement in damage, (when did you start <br/>
&gt; doing more than<br/>
&gt; (2xdmg)+1.  I have heard so many different stories I don&#39;t know who to<br/>
&gt; believe.  I have a strength of 90 base, and 102 with songs.  Does the<br/>
&gt; strength effect the damage, or is based on skill points, or what.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would appreciate any response you could offer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
