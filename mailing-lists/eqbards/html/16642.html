Subject: UPDATE 2 - we&#39;re getting there!<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I quite like a lot of these ideas.  To save bandwidth, I won&#39;t chime in <br/>
&quot;neat&quot; or &quot;I like this!&quot; but take it as read wherever I don&#39;t make a <br/>
comment. = )<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
1. Party Bind<br/>
We did not want a bind song if it was identical to casters, however if the <br/>
song allowed you to bind anyone anyplace (melees included) then with spell <br/>
reagent costs and mana tolls, we would certainly welcome it, especially at <br/>
higher (51+) levels since expansion zones are rumored to be mammoth in <br/>
scale.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I don&#39;t think, granted that we&#39;re getting at level 51+ a song which <br/>
duplicates the spell every caster gets by level 14, that this mana cost and <br/>
reagent are justified.  How often will you USE a party-bind song at 51+ <br/>
level?  I haven&#39;t even bothered getting bound in about 5 levels now, at 44 - <br/>
and I could get bound any night of the week.  There are always casters who <br/>
can cast bind (with our clarity their downtime is minimal), so this song has <br/>
very limited use at best - it can be hard to find people to bind you, but as <br/>
you increase in level you make more and more friends, and this hasn&#39;t <br/>
troubled me in 30 levels.  It&#39;s low on my list of desirable songs, and the <br/>
mana cost and reagent seem excessive.  Unless we can also gate, binding is <br/>
NOT a big deal, and of the two gate is 300 times moe useful.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
6. An improved AE DoT with added effect (stamina drain being a common<br/>
thread, the other was a lifetap affect).  Question at large: do mobs have <br/>
stamina and if so, does it impact their ability to fight?<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Granted that DDD is a DoT/AC debuff, and CoC is a DoT/attack speed debuff, <br/>
how about a simple AE DoT / resistance debuff?  Not unlike the chant series, <br/>
granted, but AE and stronger... could be very useful.  Another option would <br/>
be a DoT / atk rating debuff (so the dumb things HIT us less often).<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
7. Upgrade to selo&#39;s OR remove hard speed cap.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Granted we&#39;re already NOT getting the full effect of the speed we have, I&#39;d <br/>
be terribly upset if they gave us a new song to do what Selo&#39;s should <br/>
already be doing.  We don&#39;t need another song.  Fix the damn speed cap.  <br/>
Please please remove this suggestion.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
8. Upgrade to clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Cassandra&#39;s Clarified Elegy<br/>
Provides clarity2 (whatever that might be) + (limited?) elegy effect.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
This effectively mimics enchanters&#39; abilities, with their int/wis buffs and <br/>
clarity II.  It is not unwarranted nor unbalanced.  It removes the need to <br/>
weave in elegy and gives increased clarity - in other words just keeps us <br/>
*almost* on par with enchanters - they&#39;ll still have better int/wis buffs.  <br/>
John Kim believes bard clarity is better than enchanter clarity, in terms of <br/>
mana regen speed.  If this is so, I sincerely hope it continues to be the <br/>
case 51+.  In any case, though, we don&#39;t want to lose ground... having <br/>
enchanters become better than us at this when right now they are perhaps <br/>
inferior, perhaps equal, would disrupt class balance and reduce our <br/>
desirability in groups.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
9. Upgrade to MR debuffing abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Fog of War. AE snare. AE slow attack speed. AE Dot. AE magic<br/>
debuff (30 pts at least). effect of fog?<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Please remember that every additional effect you add to a song is another <br/>
saving throw by the recipients.  A song that has 4 or 5 effects bundled <br/>
together is worthless because of the astronomical resist rate.  I&#39;d never <br/>
use this, because it would rarely stick on deep greens.  I&#39;d settle for AE <br/>
chains, bu thonestly this is another low-priority song for me - the other <br/>
ideas here are far better in my opinion.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
10. One-way teleport (self only?  to bard guild?).<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Please DON&quot;T remove this.  I think being able to get some very limited (and <br/>
preferably random) teleporting abilities keeps us the jack-of-all-trades we <br/>
were designed to be.  We&#39;ll never have the control or versatility of a <br/>
wizard or druid... but being able to port to cities is something nobody can <br/>
do right now.  It&#39;s a great tool for leaving dungeons, while druids and <br/>
wizards remain best qualified to get parties TO dungeons.  The control and <br/>
abundance of druid/wizard ports will still make them the preferred mode of <br/>
travel in most cases.  You want to get to High Pass or Rivervale?  Bards can <br/>
get you within 5 zones... wizards and druids can get you within from 1 to 3 <br/>
zones, depending.  Self or group... if it&#39;s group it ought to probably take <br/>
half our mana... so you get 2 shots at arriving where you want to (33% <br/>
chance of any bard guild).<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
11. Mem blur song.<br/>
<br/>
Fitful&#39;s Forgetful Improv<br/>
Voice<br/>
Causes the target to become so fixated on the improv that it forgets<br/>
whatever else it was dong.  Drawback: Bard possibly left on hate list.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
A mem blur that leaves only the bard on the hate list?  Ouch.  LOADING <br/>
PLEASE WAIT... we don&#39;t need this, we have plenty of tools to taunt with <br/>
right now (Chains, for example, has a VERY high taunt rating, and far <br/>
greater combat utility).<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
12. Upgraded Atk Song<br/>
Since we are out speed buffed by enchanters, a straight addition to Atk<br/>
with an added component.  Most commonly heard suggestion: rune type<br/>
shielding.  Other suggestions: massive ac bonus, massive regeneration<br/>
effect, massive MR buff.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Problem with rune shielding is simply that we refresh our songs every 6 <br/>
seconds.  A song that lowers the damage received instead of making us immune <br/>
to a certain amount of damage is far more balanced.  Say the song reduces <br/>
damage received by (level/2 or level/3).  At level 60, you could weave this <br/>
and hymn and almost (but not quite) ignore a mob of VERY low greens.  It <br/>
would help fights against high-level monsters some, but not too much granted <br/>
their damage output will be in hundreds of points per blow.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
16. Serious upgrade to healing. (NB:  of all the issues brough up, this<br/>
needs the most serious analysis btw.)<br/>
<br/>
Currently at 50th with a store bought lute:<br/>
Niv´┐¢s=15 hp/tick<br/>
Hymn=17 hp/tick<br/>
Total=roughly 30hp/tick<br/>
<br/>
Typical mobs encountered at that level hit in low 100´┐¢s, double hit 100% of <br/>
the time and have an approximate delay of 25.  As a damage per second <br/>
figure, that approaches 80 damage/second, 3 seconds/tick, 240 damage/tick.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Ummm it&#39;s 6 seconds per tick.  A tick is not the startup time for a song <br/>
(3.0 seconds), it&#39;s how much time elapses in between pulses when you leave a <br/>
song running.  This means your figures are all off by 50%. = (<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
17. Melanie´┐¢s Call to Arms<br/>
<br/>
I came up with a song that is the opposite of Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous<br/>
Motion. A song that teleports all party members in the zone to the bards <br/>
location.<br/>
Name: Melanie&#39;s Call to Arms<br/>
This song would be extremely useful in conjunction with a binding group<br/>
leader.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Maybe I just need more caffeine, but I don&#39;t see how the place where the <br/>
group is bound or who bound them has any impact on the utility of this song. <br/>
  Anyone who can cast gate can already bind anywhere.  All in all a great <br/>
idea for a song and one with many many many uses.  Trying to get deep into <br/>
dangerous territory?  Wait at the zone while the crazy bard sneaks in, <br/>
risking life and limb.  I LOVE it - this would make bards far more desirable <br/>
in groups, no question.  I suspect due to the huge utility of such a song <br/>
that they&#39;d want to limit it somehow... mana or reagents, bah.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
19. On mana regeneration and putting ´┐¢no mana´┐¢ into perspective, by John H. <br/>
Kim ;)<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I love this summary.  However, it is not a song suggestion, but a guideline <br/>
for song creation.  It ought therefore to be in the preface or conclusion, <br/>
rather than in the middle of the song list.<br/>
<br/>
I feel you ought to address somewhere in this document the guidelines for <br/>
functionality of bards songs at 51+.  Among the isseus to be addressed would <br/>
be the balance of bard/enchanter clarity (i.e. don&#39;t change the balance, <br/>
whatever it might be - enchanters getting clarity II has many bards <br/>
concerned); the speed cap on Selo&#39;s; the scale of damage of our targeted <br/>
damage songs (Bellow and the chants just don&#39;t do meaningful damage at level <br/>
50, so they need rescaling or replacement at 51+); and the current status of <br/>
lullaby (it is demonstrably broken, no word yet).  These are not song <br/>
suggestions, but rather observations about the manner in which our existig <br/>
songs will be used and useful at 51+.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
20. Upgraded mez capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Granted we have broken mes songs now, I really don&#39;t want an upgraded broken <br/>
song, nor to replace my broken songs 35 levels later with working ones.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
22. What&#39;d I forget?<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Upgrade to Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon.  Possibilities include party-wide <br/>
carillon, identical to existing one; or bard-only improved action song which <br/>
works simultaneously on all factions (either exactly like existing so or <br/>
simply setting EVERY mob in a zone to indifferent).<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Rokenn&#39;s song:<br/>
Selo&#39;s Shooting Star<br/>
Instrument: Percussion<br/>
Effect: Group, a combination of Selo&#39;s Accelerando, Shauri&#39;s Sonorous <br/>
Clouding, and Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles with infravision. Be great fun for <br/>
traveling<br/>
<br/>
Please include this as one of the desirable songs - it has great utility and <br/>
would simplify travel immensely.  Also note that right now it is impossible <br/>
to move quickly and invisibly, or levitate invisibly, so this song adds <br/>
something we cannot currently do.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
How about a charisma buff?  It&#39;d be very useful when woven with our mental <br/>
songs (charm, fear, mes, lull, etc).<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Force shock-style song, which knocks the target back and does some DD damage <br/>
- this is an upgrade to Bellow, with the fun Tentacle-terror effect.  Could <br/>
be made AE or targeted - more useful if targeted of course.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Illusions!  Self-only, party-wide, anything!  GIVE US ILLUSIONS!  I want to <br/>
be able to pretend to be other things, other races, anything... just the <br/>
ability to muck about with illusions would be great.  Don&#39;t give us the <br/>
perks enchanters get from their illusions if it&#39;s &quot;overpowered&quot; and <br/>
&quot;unbalanced&quot; (bwahahaha) but let us have at high levels something enchanters <br/>
can do their whole careers!<br/>
