<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066944141">Call me indecisive - but money accumulates in my bank - cause I can never decide what to spend it on.  I have in the neighborhood of 850pp.  I&#39;m not too thrilled with my armor.  Mostly some banded still a lot of barbed, etc.  A few pieces of bronze.  I&#39;m at level 26 btw - so I&#39;m almost at the point where I can think about questing for Lambent.<br/>
<br/>
    But anyway - I got to the armor store in E Freeport and look at the Steel Plate.  I notice that they mostly offer 1 or 2 AC points above the equivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.  Question is - is it worth it?  How important is one or two AC points?  How important is 2 or 3 but giving up STR or whatever bonuses.  I have Blackened Iron Shoulders.  It says &quot;Magic Item&quot;.  What does this actually provide?  Is the Steel Pauldron the equivalent?  Pretty annoying you can&#39;t tell without buying and then you can sell it at a fraction of what you pay for it if you make a mistake (obviously forcing you to check website like EQualizer...<br/>
<br/>
    Anyone have any other suggestions on what to spend money on?  For weaps I&#39;m using Dirk and Barbed Leather Whip.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
