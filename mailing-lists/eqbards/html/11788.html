<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754724208">Well, I am getting better with charm ;p  <br/>
<br/>
If I am really serious, I will swap in all my cha stuff (crude stein, drosco<br/>
amulet, silk evening tunic), remember to dequip my StoW, beg a SoW or have<br/>
someone sing Selos.  I have not actually used all my extra cha stuff since I<br/>
got my guise and that might really help.  I could try for a cha buff from an<br/>
enchanter but if there is an enchanter - wtf am I doing the charming for? <br/>
<br/>
But what seems to be the stumbling block for me is the weaving.  I have a<br/>
charm pallette set with charm and selos hot keyed and am getting better at<br/>
using it.  Even so, when charm sticks, it seems that I just barely have<br/>
enough time to cast charm, cast selos and then need to immediately re-cast<br/>
charm (cuz it broke and they are both charging at me now.)  The duration of<br/>
my charm seems very very short.  I can barely charm, target mob, hit /pet<br/>
attack hot key, f1-f1 retarget pet before it breaks and I am scrambling for<br/>
a re-cast of charm.  But like I say - I am getting better!  And I really<br/>
should try all my  cha stuff now - not just the stein.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have found that fear + chain is really good for soloing but it<br/>
really helps to run them in the right order.  I have been doing Avo&#39;s and<br/>
Centaurs in South Karana lately.  I track a target and get close.  Then fear<br/>
them and auto-attack.  Now chain then fear again.  If I do this a few times,<br/>
it gives me sufficient &#39;lead&#39; on the mob in hp loss.  Once I get a bub or so<br/>
ahead of him, I will wince him with Denons.  But once I go to 3 song<br/>
rotation, I expect to take some hits.  Prolly should be doing: fear, chain,<br/>
fear, denon, fear, chain, fear, denon.<br/>
<br/>
But I never learned to kite things.  I don&#39;t have the patience for those<br/>
long drawn out solo fights.  I much prefer to be in a party with good tanks<br/>
- I don&#39;t mind melee myself if we have good casters.  So, I have not put the<br/>
time in to learn how to do solo stuff. I&#39;d try a couple and spent too much<br/>
time either dieing or zoning and then give up and go get in a group<br/>
somewhere or grab a partner. <br/>

		Sylly, no offense, you seem to have trouble charming? (just<br/>
from your<br/>
		post here) One misconception I think many Bards have is that<br/>
you sing<br/>
		charm, it works and you sit back and watch the show. This is<br/>
not true.<br/>
		I&#39;d say charm fails at LEAST 50%, maybe 75% some times. The<br/>
trick is to<br/>
		weave charm and selo&#39;s(with drum) so you can run backwards<br/>
from the<br/>
		targets and re-sing charm as many times as needed. During a<br/>
particularly<br/>
		bad run yesterday I had to sing charm NINE times before I<br/>
charmed my HG.<br/>
