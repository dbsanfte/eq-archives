Orb.  The MR debuff should allow fear/chain to stick pretty well :)<br/>

Ok, we already know that charming a mob clears the damage list<br/>
but (probably) not the hate list.<br/>
<br/>
Being charmed *by* a mob clears you from the charmer&#39;s hate<br/>
list.  I (foolishly :) tried to see if I could solo the<br/>
froglok noble in Lower Guk.  I got 4 attempts at it before<br/>
giving up.<br/>
<br/>
First try, I used my standard lineup - equip lute, Hymn +<br/>
Niv&#39;s + CoC + CoD.  No good.  He nuked me to half, then<br/>
charmed me.  I scurried off while charmed, and when it broke I<br/>
was outside his aggro radius.  He didn&#39;t come after me.  But<br/>
his pet (whom I&#39;d damaged with my DoTs) did.  I feared them<br/>
and made it to the zone with about a bubble left.<br/>
<br/>
Second try, I switched to Hymn + Niv&#39;s + CoC + Mystic<br/>
Shielding, on the theory that my 125 magic resist would help<br/>
me resist some of his nukes and charm.  It worked for the<br/>
first two nukes (resisted), then his third nuke took off two<br/>
bubbles.  I feared them, ran for the zone while invis, a<br/>
see-invis mino attacked me, and I made it to the zone with<br/>
138 hp left.<br/>
<br/>
Third try, I tried weapons + Chain + Fear.  This eliminated<br/>
the pet as a factor (of the two fear-paths, the priest/<br/>
crusader area was camped, and the area towards the maze was<br/>
all green to me), and if I could consistently keep up<br/>
Chain/Fear, it would eliminate his spells as a factor (very<br/>
annoying since enchanter DDs also have a stun that will<br/>
interrupt your songs).  Both Chain and fear ended up being<br/>
resisted too much, he nuked me to half, then charmed me.  <br/>
After the charm wore off, he was outside aggro radius, and the<br/>
pet didn&#39;t attack me again (presumably because I hadn&#39;t<br/>
damaged it).  I didn&#39;t have to zone.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth try, on the theory that I&#39;d just gotten unlucky with<br/>
resists, I tried weapons + Chain + fear again.  Only this<br/>
time, I put up Mystic Shielding before pulling him (most of<br/>
the damage I was took before came from the first couple<br/>
nukes).  Basically the same result - he resisted me too much<br/>
for this to be consistent.  Strangely enough this time, after<br/>
I was charmed, his pet continued to attack me.  :)  Haven&#39;t<br/>
figured that one out.  Anyhow, because I was fighting his pet<br/>
while charmed, I didn&#39;t scurry out of aggro range, and when<br/>
charm broke he was on me and hit me for 102 with his staff.  <br/>
I feared them all again and made it to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I gave up.  I didn&#39;t have enough confidence in<br/>
my melee to be able to Fear/Chain him consistently with his<br/>
resist rate.  With a max melee damage of 100+, I doubted I&#39;d<br/>
be able to survive the occasional resist.<br/>
<br/>
The entire live side of Lower Guk was empty at 7am.  No<br/>
players were harmed during these tests.  :)<br/>
