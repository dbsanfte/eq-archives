<div id="ygrps-yiv-82261508">Um. My enchanter cast Invisibility then Invis vs Undead on a groupmate.<br/>
The Invis Vs Undead icon overwrote the Invisibility icon.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if you are invisible and go through a bard song when it pulses,<br/>
the icon remains but you are no longer invisible. My friend,<br/>
Windsong&#39;s, a bard who has gotten killed by this. (The now<br/>
no-longer invisible person was aggro&#39;d on by monsters that<br/>
then came back and killed Windsong, because she transferred to their<br/>
aggro-list somehow.<br/>

&gt;If you had someone else casting on ya - yeah you could.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Been playing a druid lately - invis has a MAJOR problem now - if you are<br/>
&gt;invis - and someone casts on you - anything - the icon doesn&#39;t go away, but<br/>
&gt;mobs can see you - songs pulsing probably work the same way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why do I consider this a bug?  Well, thinking you are invis - and not is a<br/>
&gt;problem - it also opens the door to being pk&#39;d via monster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also - harmony does it too - and harmony has a LARGE area of effect. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;accidentally uninvis&#39;d folks in unrest by harmony on a totally different<br/>
&gt;floor - while they were above or below invis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I do not know if you ever could have both these cast on you at once.<br/>
&gt;&gt;You can&#39;t anymore. My enchanter, who has both spells, has tried to do<br/>
&gt;&gt;so on her groupmates. One overwrites the other (whichever is cast last<br/>
&gt;&gt;overwrites the first)<br/>
