&gt;i&#39;ve never even tried the psalms of warmth and cooling, but i will check<br/>
&gt;them out tonight.  get the level 40 song, so maybe you can tell us what it<br/>
&gt;does, cause no one can see any discernible effects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also with the fear song, you dont need someone to ensnare.  Solo away with<br/>
&gt;chain/fear twisting (dunno what word we are using now hehe).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you dont need somebody no, but it helps if somebody else or another bard is<br/>
chaining/ensnaring. We took on 4, counem 4 spectres with a lvl 39 pali, 39<br/>
bard, 40 bard, and a lvl 32 cleric :). I fear&#39;d and keyana chained, we all<br/>
did bits of damage and the cleric covered the odd spectre or 2 that<br/>
resisted a fear once. <br/>

&gt;And yes the Tuyen&#39;s and Fufil songs are single Target.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thats what i thought. bah. not really worth it then im thinking, especially<br/>
with how much they get resisted now.</div>
