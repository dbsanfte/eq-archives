<div id="ygrps-yiv-462235036">According what I read by abashi, xp is NOT divided equally,  If you are<br/>
grouped, the hybrid takes more xp from the pool,.<br/>
So all this Hybrid xp penality is crap,  You level just as fast as someone<br/>
with a penality. It only effects solo.  Which brings up,<br/>
why even be a human?<br/>

I should have included a caveat in my reply.  At the time the enchanter I<br/>
grouped with mentioned getting more EXP as a human instead of a high elf,<br/>
the ShowEQ program was not around.  Any theories on EXP gain were just<br/>
guesses.  The enchanter community assumed they got more EXP as humans.  Now<br/>
that ShowEQ has shown how EXP is split we know that their assumption was<br/>
incorrect.<br/>

This is a load of hoey.  Exp is divided amoungs the party based on the total<br/>
exp in the party.  The so called &#39;experience penalty&#39; for hybrid and<br/>
non-halflings is not applied to exp as you recieve it is merely the amount<br/>
of experience you need for the next level.  So if a Troll SK or a Halfling<br/>
Druid kill a mob they both get the EXACT same amount of experience.  It may<br/>
register different on the experience bar, but that is a function of the<br/>
Druid need fewer experience points to level.  Not a muliplier to the exp<br/>
they just recieved.<br/>

&gt; I used to group quite a bit with an enchanter friend.  He was <br/>
&gt; a high elf but<br/>
&gt; would almost always have the human illusion up.  He said that <br/>
&gt; the reason for<br/>
&gt; this is that he would get more EXP as a human instead of a high elf.<br/>
&gt; Supposedly this was common knowledge among the enchanter <br/>
&gt; community.  Now I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know for certain if this is a fact or not, but if it is <br/>
&gt; true, then it<br/>
&gt; would be a safe assumption that bards with a DE illusion <br/>
&gt; would get the same<br/>
&gt; EXP modifier as true DEs.  <br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been told that ShowEQ shows that when you are using the guise<br/>
&gt; illusion dark elf your exp table gets changed to dark elf, so I guess<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s possible, though I haven&#39;t heard of it being tested yet. <br/>
&gt; All bards<br/>
&gt; seem to get the same exp penalty regardless of race so I don&#39;t know if<br/>
&gt; you would get a change or not. When I heard the issue discussed it was<br/>
&gt; from testing a warrior with the pre-patch guise so the exp difference<br/>
&gt; would matter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wonder if a troll sk who used the old guise would actually need less<br/>
&gt; exp.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Now, I have looked over all the bard sites and been reading <br/>

&gt; &gt; some time and never seen mention of this.  The other bard <br/>

&gt; &gt; said he had searched the rogue sites with no info found.  <br/>
&gt; Has anyone here<br/>
&gt; &gt; seen or heard of this penalty?<br/>
