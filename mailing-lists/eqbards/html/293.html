<div id="ygrps-yiv-107280453">Well, it used to make them forget about you. Now it seems to nix the &#39;S&#39;<br/>
list of the creatures and add you to it. This also means that you&#39;ll tick<br/>
off anything that steps in range regardless of if they were mad at you or<br/>
not before. Best use is to continuously play it or stack it when you have a<br/>
large group or if your friendly mage type just unloaded on something.<br/>

Yesterday I got the song Kelin&#39;s Lucyd Lullaby in Kelethin. I&#39;ve heard<br/>
several times that this is one of the most powerful bard songs and I was<br/>
really<br/>
looking forward to get it. But now i have to admit that i am quite<br/>
disapponited. I thought that it should stop monsters attacking you, and this<br/>
seems to<br/>
be true, but after a few seconds they start attacking you again. I&#39;ve read<br/>
in this newsgroup that the song makes monsters forget you so they wont<br/>
attack you any more when you go away, but that doesnt seem to be true. In<br/>
fact<br/>
EVERY monster in a certain area around you will attack after a while when<br/>
you<br/>
are singing the song. So if you are in real trouble and want to get rid of<br/>
that nasty monster attacking you, you just start singing that song and 10<br/>
seconds later EVRY living being near you will start attacking you. I really<br/>
dont know why this song is called to be one of the most powerful ones...<br/>
If i am wrong please tell me, I would really appreciate.<br/>
