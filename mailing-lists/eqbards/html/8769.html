<b>Subject:</b> RE: Barbed Leather Whip Questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-702057036">1)  I paid 150PP for a barbed leather whip (BLW) and after getting some<br/>
thulian claws sold it for 150PP.  I wouldn&#39;t pay much higher than 150PP.  In<br/>
regards to finding someone selling it, for every item in the game your best<br/>
chances of buying it is to go to the zone where it is found.    <br/>
<br/>
2)  I&#39;ve never had either of the two weapons you listed but I&#39;m almost<br/>
certain the DAM/DLY ratio for the BLW is better than either of them.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Unless you get a group to help you camp the PGT spawn, it will be almost<br/>
impossible for you to get a PGT by yourself.  That spawn is heavily camped<br/>
and any nuker can KS it from you.  With the new rules giving the kill to the<br/>
group that does the most damage, you should be able to get a PGT with a<br/>
group of three easily.  The going rate for a PGT on E&#39;ci is around 300PP if<br/>
you don&#39;t want to camp for it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have a Dragoon Dirk and have boosted my piercing to around 60 (out of<br/>
&gt; 80). I find that I still like the secure feeling of my heavy, slow mino<br/>
&gt; axe for big stuff. I&#39;m planning to put the dirk in my off hand when I hit<br/>
&gt; 17 and want something magical for the primary. The barbed leather whip<br/>
&gt; seems to have good stats.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Questions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) How much should I auction for it and where? (I know it comes out of<br/>
&gt; Najena)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Is it better bang for the buck than a combine ls or scim?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) Do I have a chance at skipping it and camping for a PGT before 20?<br/>
