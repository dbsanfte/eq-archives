<div id="ygrps-yiv-122977951">He thought all it did was stun the mob for a few seconds.  Its easy to<br/>
play<br/>
  a battle bard and sing mana song after combat.<br/>
<br/>
  - Your right everyone does have their own way to play bards.  And I do<br/>
love the &quot;battle bard&quot; side of things.  Why?  Because I want to be part of<br/>
the action.....<br/>
<br/>
  But see with bards we can do many things - As I am finding out with<br/>
Jacana....<br/>
<br/>
  I pull rather well with Jac in groups.  Because she has the speed she can<br/>
run faster (unless there&#39;s a shaman in the group to sow a ranger...)  Just<br/>
run up do a bellow and run off *grin*  And while running back to the group<br/>
get a bit of kiting in ;)<br/>
<br/>
  Also Jac&#39;s weapons right now are just amazing as far as I am concerned.<br/>
She&#39;s not bad in combat and I have yet to see a group complain about her in<br/>
combat.<br/>
<br/>
  But as a bard you need to be smart.  If I see the group is balanced enough<br/>
then I will switch back to instruments.  I am not great at twisting<br/>
insturments yet but I can do something...<br/>
<br/>
  Another about bards that I have found groups love is the hate list :)  If<br/>
a pull is too big the bard can run around the group with 3/4 of the mobs<br/>
pulled run heal run heal.<br/>
<br/>
  But I really can&#39;t blame some of the higher level bards for not toally<br/>
knowing what something may do.  Some of these people have been playing bards<br/>
for AGES!  And us new little bards can look at all these great web sites<br/>
that tell us exactly what the song does....<br/>
