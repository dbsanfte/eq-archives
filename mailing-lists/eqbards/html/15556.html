What they need is a &quot;Cone of Silence&quot; spell.  Killing all emotes and says<br/>
for the time it is in effect and cancellable at will.<br/>

I attended the same thing with the same results in Xegony and I can&#39;t agree<br/>
more.   Part of the problem were clueless &quot;RP&#39;ers&quot; that thought that people<br/>
were interested in their stupid emotes &quot;JoeBlow bows to Myomg Mistmore and<br/>
pledges his honor to him&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing that Verant could do that would probably be a trivial number of<br/>
lines of code - would be to change the text color of says from the GM&#39;s in<br/>
the event.<br/>
<br/>
But the biggest problem is that the vast number of people who are just<br/>
unable to shut their traps!<br/>

&gt; We got wind of this GM event that was gonna happen in Mistmoore so we<br/>
headed<br/>
&gt; on over.  Sure enough, on the ramp near the zone was Lord Mistmoore (GM in<br/>
&gt; PC looked like male DE), Lord Garamont (sp? a NPC), &quot;a wounded elf&quot; (NPC),<br/>
&gt; and another NPC (if i recall correctly.) And they were trying to carry on<br/>
&gt; some role playing dialog and unfold some story.<br/>
