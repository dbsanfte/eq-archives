         I used throwing daggers as a fetch tool when I was soling before I <br/>
     got Bellow.  It worked like a low mana attack spell to &#39;hook&#39; mobs <br/>
     before someone else grabs them.  Worked great in the desert of Roe to <br/>
     hook beetles and spiders.  I quite using them when I got Bellow but I <br/>
     have noticed that the delay with Bellow can be frustrating and was <br/>
     just thinking of buying some shirakin(sp)(they&#39;re cheaper and lighter) <br/>
     last night.  No delay. <br/>
         I find them only useful as a &#39;hooking&#39; device they do to little <br/>
     damage and cost to much to be useful as a mainline combat choice.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Perhaps there is a way - and I just missed it, do we ever get to weild <br/>
&gt; one weapon and an instrument?  I could have sworn I saw a higher<br/>
&gt; level bard<br/>
&gt; doing just this once, but could never get it to equip. I figured <br/>
&gt; I might be<br/>
&gt; able to do this once I got dual wield, but if there is one that lets us do <br/>
&gt; it, I&#39;ve not found it yet.<br/>
     <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to get questions about this all the time when I carried a mino axe <br/>
and a drum or mandolin.  You CAN carry a weapon and an instrument at the <br/>
same time, the problem is you can&#39;t use the weapon in a conventional way. <br/>
Before I got dual wield I would put my mino axe in my range weapon slot and <br/>
my intrument in my secondary mellee slot.  This gave the appearance that I <br/>
was carrying a weapon and an instrument.  Too bad the only way I could use <br/>
the weapon would be to throw it at that point.<br/>
     <br/>
On a related note, have any of you bards used throwing skill at all? I&#39;ve <br/>
found it to be a collosal waste of money so far, but maybe I am doing it <br/>
wrong. :)<br/>
