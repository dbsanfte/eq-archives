That is not to say the castle isnt a dangerous place. I died many, many a<br/>
times trying to figure out how to do this. If i could, i would just explain<br/>
it, but i tried this already. There is no one single trick to mistmoore...<br/>
its a ton of little things that you learn over time. That being said, a<br/>
full party of lvl 40-50&#39;s can get decimated in mistmoore in no time flat.<br/>
You pull a couple of harm touching mobs (who knew cooks could harm<br/>
touch!?!) and you wont even make it into melee range. I know lvl 50 druids<br/>
that go in there and solo the place constantly also, you just have to be<br/>
willing to spend some time there. Just dont wander in with a full group and<br/>
expect to own the place :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;Dunno your level or type of group you play with, but you <br/>
&gt;&gt;are in error (not a direct personal attack, maybe just <br/>
&gt;&gt;misinformed)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then I have been misinformed by hundreds of people I talk to<br/>
&gt;across every single server.  I have never heard of a two man<br/>
&gt;team doing the castle reliably, you must have got really lucky.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Parties of full L50s have had to evac from the castle.<br/>
&gt;And I know for sure that L40-45 parties are vulernable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If it was as easy as you say, then there would be a lot<br/>
&gt;more Soulfires and EBWs and Nightshade Wreaths floating<br/>
&gt;around.  People are &#39;afraid&#39; of the castle and for good<br/>
&gt;reason.  It&#39;s not the picnic people make it out to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However:  I will give you this, that in wolf form you <br/>
&gt;could invade the castle, harmony everything, and possibly<br/>
&gt;pull and kill one thing at a time.  If that&#39;s the ticket,<br/>
&gt;then I understand your point.  But to a group with no<br/>
&gt;pack wolf form, trains are the ultimate killer.<br/>
