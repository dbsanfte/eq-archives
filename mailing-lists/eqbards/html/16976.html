<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917057854">Resistence is largely level based.  Beat on blues for sticking your procs<br/>
better.  Later on in life you get some songs that lower targets resistances<br/>
but even then the effect is limited.  Theoretically good but practically<br/>
only a marginal benefit.<br/>

&gt; The goblins in high keep (all of them yellow and red)<br/>
&gt; keep resisting the proc.  I have successfully proced<br/>
&gt; like 3 times in 4 hours. Is there anything I can do to<br/>
&gt; help this. </span></blockquote></div>
