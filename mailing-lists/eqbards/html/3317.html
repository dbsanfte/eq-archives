Now my other observation has anyone noticed that if a mob hits you while <br/>
you are starting up a song he seems to be hit for max damage?  I noticed <br/>
the difference awhile ago when I picked up bellow.  I used to play one <br/>
song during combat.  Once I got bellow I noticed that hits that landed <br/>
just as I started a song resulted in greater damage.  This is something <br/>
that I have seen while playing my mage character over the last few days. <br/>
If I am hit while casting death beetles almost always hit for 26 or so. <br/>
Can anyone else confirm it?  When I saw it I just thought I was seeing <br/>
things.<br/>
     <br/>
     OUCH!  If this is true then Weaving songs may not be the best of <br/>
     ideas.  More chances for a full damage hit.  Anyone else notice this?  <br/>
     I will watch closely from now on but my general impression is that he <br/>
     might be right...  Makes being a support bard make much more sense.<br/>
     If this is true (shudder) then this could change the whole methodology <br/>
     behind running a bard character.<br/>
