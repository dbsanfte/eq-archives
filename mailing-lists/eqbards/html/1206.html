Correction: wow, I *was* rich, until I bought the plate. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I already had a small bronze breastplate.  The only reason to upgrade to <br/>
steel was to save about 2 pounds of weight. The medium steel breastplate <br/>
weighed more than the small bronze breastplate, with the same armor class, <br/>
so it was useless to me.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I decided that saving 2 pounds of weight was worth 800 platinum. I <br/>
started with only a 70 strength, so every pound is critical, and I had <br/>
managed to build my bank account up to 1100 plat.  None of the players at <br/>
my level were selling anything for platinum -- all the higher level magic <br/>
goodies are auctioned as &quot;trade only.&quot;  So I didn&#39;t have anything better to <br/>
do with the money.  (By the way, if any of you are on Solusek Ro and have a <br/>
Gladius, Band of Flesh, or Traveller&#39;s Backpack available for sale or <br/>
trade, I&#39;m very interested.  I can offer an Ivory Bracelet, Savant&#39;s Cap, <br/>
or Lizard Scale Cloak, or might be able to arrange a three-way trade for <br/>
something else you want.  And for low level struggling bards on Solusek Ro, <br/>
if you need help with something or a bit of cash to get you over a hump, <br/>
feel free to give me a call.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saving up now to convert my small bronze helmet into a small steel <br/>
helmet.  I just hope it&#39;s not as ugly as the bronze one!  Every other race <br/>
that I&#39;ve seen gets really cool looking bronze helmets.  The wood elf <br/>
version, according to my guildmates, makes me look like a push-pin.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been making 50 plat or so per night-long lizard slaughter in Cazic. <br/>
 All weapons carried by Defenders and up are fine steel, selling for around <br/>
5 plat to vendors or more if you take the time and trouble to find a player <br/>
who wants it.<br/>
