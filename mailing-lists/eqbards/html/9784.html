<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376717942">Here is my original post.  Somehow it didn&#39;t make the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on the list and decided it&#39;s time to join in.  Here are a couple of questions.<br/>
<br/>
Who is GZ?  I&#39;ve seen it mentioned several times in talking about Verant, but it&#39;s not in the glossary I went to to try and get an answer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just gotten my 12th song and have been hunting Dervs in N Ro.  ButI remember reading somewhere about an Island that has Gargoyles that would be appropriate <br/>
for someone near my level to hunt.  I remember theposter said that the loot was worth about a plat each and weighed 0.1lbs.  Does this ring any bells for <br/>
anyone?  <br/>
<br/>
The Derv camps are just too crowded and often with people that think they are super-heros.  I lost my 12th level and had to regain it from just such a <br/>
person.  Killed while memming bellow for the first time andthey trained the Dervs onto me. (Grrr)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve enjoyed the interaction here and look forward to your responses.  Thanks in advance and <br/>
<br/>
May your voice always sing true,<br/>
