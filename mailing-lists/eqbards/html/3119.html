&gt; The issue was that, grouped with a lvl 7 halfling druid and being a lvl 7<br/>
&gt; wood elf bard myself, and with neither of us carrying anything (no weapons,<br/>
&gt; no armor, no food, no nada) she would continuously outrun the affects of my<br/>
&gt; song.  Racing her with no songs or spells, she still outruns me.  So we<br/>
&gt; compared pings & packets & such.  No big differences.  We compared modems.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got a 56K that usually connects at 28.8, the druid&#39;s got cable modem,<br/>
&gt; but has run EQ on a 28.8 and had no problems then.  Then we compared PCs.<br/>
&gt; Mine&#39;s a P300 MMX, 64 MB RAM, 16 MB on the video.   The druid runs on dual<br/>
&gt; 200s with 194 MB RAM and a similar video card.   Grrr.  Guess I&#39;ll have to<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unless EQ is specifically written to take advanatage of dual<br/>
processor systems, she is running EQ at the same speed as a<br/>
single P200 system.  The other processor is sitting idle.<br/>
<br/>
What resolutions are you two running at?  Also try turning<br/>
down some of the display options and special effects.  I heard<br/>
turning off 3D sound makes a big difference, although you lose<br/>
the ability to hear something sneaking up on you.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, on a related note, apparently you&#39;re not supposed to be able to do<br/>
&gt; this, but in playing around we managed to stack SOW & Accelerado.  The only<br/>
&gt; time we could get it to work though was when Accelerado went into the second<br/>
&gt; space and SOW in the third.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On another related note, has anyone else noticed that if<br/>
you&#39;re playing Accelerando on a drum and you zone, when you<br/>
come out the other side you default to Accelerando-w/o-drum<br/>
speed?<br/>
