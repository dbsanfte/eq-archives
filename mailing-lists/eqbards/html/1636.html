&gt; I did some experimentation with invisibility last night at<br/>
&gt; the big monolith on the shore in North Karana.  It seems<br/>
&gt; that with the song, I am also invisible to undead (<br/>
&gt; zombies and skellies).  Of course if you have an unlucky<br/>
&gt; moment and become visible, then they all attack.<br/>

going.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bear in mind the justification for the bard&#39;s invisibility is<br/>
&quot;a soft mist surrounds you.&quot;  So the way I figure it, our<br/>
invisibility is not the same as the invisibility spell<br/>
(&quot;Soandso fades away&quot;).  So perhaps the difference with undead<br/>
is intentional.  It would also explain why we have a big<br/>
glowing ball of light to give away our position (although it<br/>
would be nice if the ball stayed there all the time to<br/>
facilitate group travel).<br/>
<br/>
Many animals seem to be able to see right through the mist<br/>
though; at least their /con message did not change with the<br/>
song.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please do not quote the entire digest in a reply - it will<br/>
just be included in the next digest making it that much<br/>
longer.  (And if someone includes that digest, it gets longer<br/>
and longer and...)  One of these days someone will write a<br/>
mailing list program that is smart enough to reject<br/>
submissions with excessive quotes...<br/>
