&gt;for the cash - most I get have one or two gold on them...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, I could certainly be wrong about the &quot;no cash&quot;.  I avoided hunting <br/>
them, but one of our guildmembers who has taken up jewelry making recently <br/>
started killing them to get gems.  That&#39;s where I heard about them carrying <br/>
gems and jewelry.<br/>
