<div id="ygrps-yiv-455485703">Oh come one, even EQLizer has had fake equipment on their site before.  Its<br/>
bound to happen.  Nobody has time to verify all of the images that get sent<br/>
in and some are bound to slip through.  Don;t know how long that image was<br/>
there but when I went in this morning there was no link to it on the &#39;Chest&#39;<br/>
page.<br/>

before crying wolf you might want to use a reputable equipment site like<br/>
eqlizer.<br/>
allakhazam will post whatever jpg anyone sends in without trying to verify<br/>
it.</div>
