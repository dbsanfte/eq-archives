<div id="ygrps-yiv-838899440">Well its been several months now since they were first mentioned in a patch<br/>
and still no one has discovered a small brass trumpet or Kelin&#39;s practice<br/>
Lute.  I know not all bards spend as much time running around asking people<br/>
about quests as I do, but still given the amount of time I am fairly certain<br/>
that if these really were in the game they would have been found by now.  GZ<br/>
insisted they really were in the game, but that we would have to look hard<br/>
for them.  I have checked nearly every merchant outside of the evil cities<br/>
and the gnomes in solusek, but have had no luck.  Why they would be in any<br/>
of those places anyhow is beyond me.  Does anyone have any other ideas, or<br/>
is this something we need to somehow emphasize further that despite Verant<br/>
thinking &#39;It&#39;s in the game&#39; it isn&#39;t?  Certainly wouldn&#39;t be the first time<br/>
they were &#39;positive&#39; that something was in the game when it wasn&#39;t<br/>
especially concerning bards.  I&#39;m sure everyone over 46 remembers the<br/>
scorned banshees they swore up and down were dropping Imbrued when they were<br/>
not.  Any ideas?<br/>
