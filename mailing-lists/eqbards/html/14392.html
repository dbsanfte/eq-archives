&gt;    Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the<br/>
&gt;       following: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon, Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre,<br/>
&gt;       Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike, and Agilmente&#39;s<br/>
&gt;       Aria of Eagles?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance,<br/>
&gt;       none.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I was glad to see it too - that was one of many questions I submitted. = )<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, too bad its incorrect.  Wind instruments have no effect on the MR<br/>
Debuff of Pixie Strike.  This is a fact known by anyone who has sung Pixie<br/>
with a flute equipped.  Obviously this group does not include any Verant<br/>
employees.<br/>
