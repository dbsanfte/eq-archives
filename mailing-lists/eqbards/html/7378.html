		everyone believes it to be dex.  i have yet to hear that<br/>
wisdom plays a<br/>
		role.  i think the consensus on dex is that if you hit more<br/>
often, you will<br/>
		proc more often.  sounds like it makes sense, but the<br/>
problem is you do NOT<br/>
		have to hit to proc, you just have to swing.  i have taken<br/>
notice of this<br/>
		after asking a level 50 warrior friend of mine for advice on<br/>
stats for my<br/>
		paladin, and he mentioned that.  with my paladin, for a fact<br/>
i have seen<br/>
		myself miss the first 3 swings of a fight, i inflicted no<br/>
melee damage, yet<br/>
		my ghoulbane definitely did proc.  dunno if this is common<br/>
knowledge to<br/>
		everyone, it surprised me.</div>
