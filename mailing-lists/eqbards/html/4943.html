<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lullaby interrupting casters <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945935752">When I see my hp get near 2 bubs - and the monsties are stronger - I am<br/>
equipping drum and keying in Selos.  Don&#39;t wait for 1 bub - get moving as<br/>
you hit 2 bubs - we are just too fragile.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, green caster bastiges  burn me hard and fast - and seems like lullaby<br/>
does not work well on them or they have cast on me from a distance outside<br/>
of lullaby range.<br/>
<br/>
Next time I am gonna get in their face with Guardian and Elemental playing<br/>
on my drum - and a couple fiter types to whack them down.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt; What level are people who have trouble with<br/>
		&gt; casters?  I have not had any trouble with<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>		I&#39;m currently level 16. I can beat a white/yellow derv<br/>
usually by myself.<br/>
		But most casting desert or island madmen (or Derv&#39;s) that<br/>
con green are<br/>
		fairly dangerous for me for some reason. They never seem to<br/>
run out of mana,<br/>
		they never seem to get interrupted by me successfully<br/>
hitting them while<br/>
		they&#39;re casting and they simply refuse to die. I don&#39;t even<br/>
want to talk<br/>
		about the ones that sit there and heal themselves while I&#39;m<br/>
hacking their<br/>
		body parts off. If you get into trouble with a caster,<br/>
you&#39;re simply SOL<br/>
		because you can&#39;t seem to outrun their spell range fast<br/>
enough. (By trouble<br/>
		I mean down to the last bubble or so)<br/>
<br/>
		And of course, there&#39;s always the chance that it&#39;s just my<br/>
tactics that<br/>
		stink. *shrug* But I still despise fighting a caster alone.<br/>
