&gt; I think you answered your own question - did you end the night with a good<br/>
&gt; amount of xp _gained_??? I think not.  Not with 2 or 3 deaths.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I got two bubbles in 6ish hours including two deaths (level 34, in L.Guk, <br/>
camping savant with mid-40s, for those who have lost this thread...).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never fought anything so red that I didn&#39;t get credit, mostly because I&#39;m <br/>
chicken. I didn&#39;t realize this could happen - thanks for the warning.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that you like to be among the highest-ranked in the group. <br/>
I&#39;m exactly the opposite.  I much prefer to be one of the lowest-ranked.  Yeah, <br/>
I&#39;m weaker, it&#39;s much easier for the MOBs to kill me, and it&#39;s much harder to <br/>
run, but it seems to me that they target me a LOT less.  Whenever I&#39;m among the <br/>
highest-ranked, I get pounded incessantly.  I&#39;m curious how others feel about <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
I consider it good when I can net a bubble in 3-4 hours, so perhaps I&#39;m not as <br/>
demanding as you!  ;)<br/>
