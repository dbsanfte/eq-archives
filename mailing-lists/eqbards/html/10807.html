<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986855744">You can damage them with your songs, and at level 10 chords plus punching<br/>
with magical gloves will do fairly good damage.  By twisting Chords and Hymn<br/>
you could probably beat some of the lower level wisps fairly easily with a<br/>
lute.  For easy magical gloves I would suggest running to Lower guk, scary<br/>
but if you are not agnostic and have not killed any frogloks you will be<br/>
ignored and can wait at the zone line for someone to get some near there<br/>
safely.  Another possibility is woven/mesh/netted gloves.  All are magical<br/>
and cheap now that monks have Gauntlet of Wu to acquire.<br/>

I was given a lambent stone and am thinking about getting a <br/>
Darkwood staff with it. I am level 10 and a magical weapon<br/>
would allow me to kill wisps while I can get experience off<br/>
of them!!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, since a magical instrument still seems a ways away.<br/>
Will my damage songs damage the wisps without one? <br/>
HOw about if I have magical gloves and not magical instrument<br/>
Anything?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!<br/>
