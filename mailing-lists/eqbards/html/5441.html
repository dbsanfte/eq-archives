<div id="ygrps-yiv-362987906">Tell me if stories are innapropriate for the list, I<br/>
figure it&#39;s easy enough to skip if you don&#39;t like....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, Katrick, we&#39;ve emptied out half of High Hold<br/>
Keep tonite, I bet my guildmaster will grant me a new<br/>
song&quot;<br/>
&quot;You think?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Sure, there&#39;s one here in the library&quot;<br/>
(Kat and Llew head down to library)<br/>
&quot;Good eve, good sire, I feel as though I have<br/>
completed my training, and would request from you my<br/>
26th song&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ah grasshopper, well you have done, many pickclaw lie<br/>
in their graves for your effort. But I must warn you,<br/>
powerful your new song, careful you must be&quot;<br/>
&quot;Careful? Why, I&#39;m the most careful person I<br/>
know&quot;(smirk)&quot;Right Kat?&quot;<br/>
&quot;He&#39;s like a grandmother, sir&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ah, Very well, here is your new song, learn well the<br/>
ways of the Apauling Screech&quot;<br/>
(A few minutes later after memorizing his new song,<br/>
Kat and Llew are walking through High Hold Pass. They<br/>
come upon a voulenteer meleeing with two gnolls)<br/>
&quot;Hey Kat, perfect chance to try out my new song, I<br/>
could help our friend the voulenteer&quot;<br/>
&quot;Go for it, brother&quot;<br/>
&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Gnoll, I was just wondering, could you<br/>
show me the way to<br/>
SSSSCCCCCCRRRRREEEEEAAAAAACCCCCCHHHHH&quot;<br/>
(two gnolls with ears nearly bleeding run for their<br/>
lives, volunteer nearly jumps out of boots and runs<br/>
for his life as well)<br/>
&quot;That went well, how bout you take out the gnolls,<br/>
I&#39;ll go apologize to the volunteer&quot;<br/>
(Katrick, after dispatching the last gnoll, looks up<br/>
to see Llewrend running at full speed towards him)<br/>
&quot;He wasn&#39;t in the mood for conversation I take it?&quot;<br/>
&quot;You know those guards, can&#39;t take a joke&quot;(as Llew<br/>
goes running by)&quot;Might want to get out of here&quot;<br/>
(several guards round the corner, Katrick wisly<br/>
decides to take off down the chasm behind Llew)<br/>
(At the bottom of the chasm, Kat and Llew stop, out of<br/>
breath and tired, but they had managed to loose the<br/>
guards. A griffawn flys lazily on the horizon)<br/>
&quot;Hey, Llew, remember that time you were sitting by the<br/>
inn and a griffawn started smacking you around&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yeah that sucked&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll bet you a plat that you can&#39;t scare that<br/>
griff&quot;<br/>
&quot;Hmm, your on&quot;<br/>
(Kat and Llew use their natural wood elf abilities to<br/>
quietly approach a nearly sleeping griffawn, Llew<br/>
begins to softly sing....)<br/>
&quot;Lullabye, and good night, go to sleep little<br/>
SSSSSSCCCCCCCRRRRRREEEEEAAAAACCCCCHHHHH&quot;<br/>
(Griffawn nearly looses it&#39;s feathers as it bolts at<br/>
maximum speed off into the distance)<br/>
&quot;That will be 1 plat, please&quot;<br/>
&quot;Hmm that was too easy, how about double or nothing?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Heh, your on&quot;<br/>
&quot;See those big foot prints, they&#39;re cyclops tracks,<br/>
how about this time you earn that money&quot;<br/>
(Llew frowns for a second, this really won&#39;t be easy)<br/>
&quot;You find him, I&#39;ll scare him&quot;<br/>
(Llew and Kat see in the distance, one very large<br/>
cyclops holding a club, and standing around with his<br/>
mouth open, his eyebrow furrowed. Again the two<br/>
brothers stealthfully approach the behemoth.)<br/>
&quot;Nice day, isn&#39;t it, Mr. Cyclops, the kind of day that<br/>
makes a man want to SSSSCCCCCRRRREEEEEAAAACCCCHHH&quot;<br/>
(Cyclops soils his loin cloth, and runs away over a<br/>
hill. Kat and Llew are rolling on the ground laughing.<br/>
Llew is just starting to get up, when Kat makes an<br/>
observation)<br/>
&quot;Hey Llew, seen South Karana lately?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Not in a bit, why&quot;<br/>
&quot;No reason, it&#39;s just that the cyclops is coming back,<br/>
I&#39;m thinking it might be a nice place this time of<br/>
year.&quot;<br/>
(Llew turns around to see a very angry large cyclops<br/>
running at full speed towards him. Lew goes to get out<br/>
his drum and run a away, but fumbles with his back<br/>
pack. He looks up to see the cyclops pointing towars a<br/>
southern direction, he takes a mighty swing, and Llew<br/>
is launched in that direction. While in mid air, Kat<br/>
catches up with Llew)<br/>
&quot;You know, it&#39;s not the swing that hurt so much&quot;<br/>
&quot;I know, it&#39;s the landing&quot;<br/>
(With that both figures crash to the earth, tumble a<br/>
few hundred yards, and lie there in a crumpled heap.)<br/>
&quot;How does your arm feel Kat?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Broken, how bout your legs?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Broken, hey, you owe me 2 plat&quot;<br/>
&quot;They&#39;re in my waist pouch, grab them, they&#39;re all<br/>
yours&quot;<br/>
&quot;Can&#39;t, hands are broken&quot;<br/>
&quot;So what do we do?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Laying here sounds good&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s what I was thinking&quot;<br/>
(In Llew&#39;s mind he can hear the voice of his<br/>
guildmaster &quot;Grasshopper, you have choosen, poorly&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Later, after their wounds were healed, the two are<br/>
walking along and see a hill giant in the distance. <br/>
&quot;Double or nothing?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Your on&quot; <br/>
<br/>
