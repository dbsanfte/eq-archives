<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688836005">Hehe, my rogue on Tallon Zek (who I just made 2 nights ago) is level 6,<br/>
completely un-twinked.  Has full leather armor, a Giant Snake Fang and is<br/>
starting to buy her banded already.  What you&#39;re doing wrong is not using<br/>
trade skills ;)  Some of them are profitable even for NPC&#39;s ;)  I can make<br/>
almost 5 platinum an hour with my rogue ;)  (at level 6 that&#39;s not bad at<br/>
all ;)<br/>
<br/>
Trade skills ;)  Specifically:  Tailoring ;)<br/>

&gt; So you&#39;re level 10, untwinked, and wearing BANDED???  What am I doing<br/>

&gt; Good job helping that other bard out.  He must have been twinked to get to<br/>
&gt; level 10 playing only one song.  Weaving&#39;s all that&#39;s kept me alive many<br/>
&gt; times over.<br/>

&gt; &gt; obvious he was twinked.  Here was this level 10 wood elf bard, dressed<br/>
&gt; &gt; head to toe in bronze.  I gave him the gauntlets, and he very<br/>
&gt; &gt; graciously<br/>
&gt; &gt; gave me his old bronze gauntlets. :)  They look nice on Adagia, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think they are too heavy, I&#39;ll probably just stick to banded for now. </span></blockquote></div>
