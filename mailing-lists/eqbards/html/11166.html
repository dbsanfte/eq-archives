<div id="ygrps-yiv-11036821">Is there any interest among those on this list in an organized protest of<br/>
our class&#39; mistreatment by Verant?  How many songs must become bugged, how<br/>
many times must we be nerfed, how much longer must we stand under the<br/>
oppressive weight of the man...  Ooops, sorry got carried away there.  But<br/>
seriously, we have several unimplemented songs (you all know the numbers),<br/>
several songs which suffer from bugs that render them of limited value<br/>
(Lullaby, Pixie Strike), and several other abilities which are either capped<br/>
too low (Dodge at least) or outright have no value (Find Traps at the least)<br/>
that we deserve attention.  <br/>
I have conducted some tests over several servers the last few days when<br/>
server numbers lowered enough to make them feasible.  Verant believes or at<br/>
least purports to believe that the classes are balanced.  In a game of<br/>
entertainment there is only one barometer of balance that would really<br/>
determine if this is so.  All classes should be equally fun and desirable to<br/>
play by Verant&#39;s own admission.  My tests show this is not the case.<br/>
Checking on Karana, Sol Ro, E&#39;ci, Erolissi Marr, Nameless, and Fennin Ro I<br/>
found the following.  With less than 1000 people on the server all classes<br/>
except Monks, Rogues, and Bards continually showed greater than 64 people<br/>
on.  Even with the vast number of Anonymous clerics of 29+ levels they were<br/>
still to great for counting.  Monks averaged around 20, with a high of 25.<br/>
Rogues averaged around 20 with a high of 23.  Bards averaged around 18 with<br/>
a high of 21.  Less than a third of the people playing each and every other<br/>
class was playing these three.  Given the number of players on the server,<br/>
less than 20% total were anonymous, so that is not the reason.  What is the<br/>
real reason?  Rogues, perhaps due to having several useless skills as their<br/>
primary focus and other long awaited skills poorly implemented could be<br/>
expected to be low.  Monks due to the recent Feign Death nerf could likewise<br/>
be expected to be low.  Bards?  Given the number of bugs, our low skill caps<br/>
and sharing of useless Rogue skills, combined with the often &quot;twitchy&quot;<br/>
nature of the class might also be lower and expected.  Should any of these<br/>
three be one third as likely to be played for these reasons?  Perhaps, but<br/>
unlikely.  Truth is at least some of these classes are not balanced.  Monks<br/>
do not get critical hits in HTH yet Rangers, a hybrid do with bows?  Rogues?<br/>
balanced?  In no way.  Bards?  Perhaps, if any significant effort was given<br/>
to fixing our bugged songs or considering our skill situation were given.<br/>
It is not.<br/>
<br/>
No one has gotten any consideration from Verant without doing one of two<br/>
things.  First if you have a powerful influence within Verant as Enchanters<br/>
do you are heard/  Second, if you make a big enough stink that they consider<br/>
it a PR problem you are heard.  These appear to be the only two cases in<br/>
which change occurs.  Verant cannot even be bothered to test our new songs<br/>
to the point of &quot;targeting a bat in a newbie zone&quot; as someone on this list<br/>
so eloquently put it long ago.  If they did they would not have implemented<br/>
three new songs for us, all DoT&#39;s... that only worked if the casting bard<br/>
targeted him/herself.  The situation is perhaps barely tolerable, but I for<br/>
one am sick of it.  Sick of it to the point where I have considered ever<br/>
more frequently retiring from the game.  Combined with the customer service<br/>
guidelines handed out to GM&#39;s wherein all players are assumed to be liars,<br/>
cheaters, and hackers of the worst sort unless they can prove otherwise I<br/>
have become disillusioned.  Last nite I died from a Page Fault that I<br/>
volunteered to send in so they could check the debug info in it and was told<br/>
I could have caused that myself so they were not allowed to rez me under<br/>
their rules handed down by Verant.  They all but said to my face that I was<br/>
a lying player who had hacked into the eqgame.exe code to &#39;get over&#39; and<br/>
dared me to prove otherwise.  That alone would not force me to quit the<br/>
game, at least until some bug deprived me of my corpse and made my character<br/>
unplayable, but I sure won&#39;t go looking for Verant to stand up and be<br/>
responsible when it comes to detrimental effects of bugs in their code.<br/>
/petition may as well be /insultme but do it politely, given the current<br/>
guidelines they use.  <br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is do we care enough to put the effort in to force change?<br/>
It is apparent that if we do not, Verant certainly will not.<br/>
