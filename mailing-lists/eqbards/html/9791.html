Nicely done!  Only a couple things to mention...<br/>
<br/>
1. Put the location to buy song as a key on the main list eg: Q,K or E or<br/>
HK.  I keep a chart like the main one handy for the frequent tells:<br/>
<br/>
yungbard: excuse me m&#39;lady can you tell me where to buy my 14th song?<br/>
<br/>
sylly: sure but first just call me sylly!  <br/>
<br/>
looks on handy dandy chart<br/>
<br/>
sylly: ahh yes you can get Lyssa&#39;s Libbertto in Erudin - look for the round<br/>
building kinda in center of town or ask someone to take you to the library -<br/>
there is no name on the building<br/>
<br/>
feels like she impressed someone<br/>
<br/>
yungbard: ahh thank you m&#39;lady <br/>
<br/>
2. It&#39;s prolly just me but I dont care for dark backgrounds. Ok, that one<br/>
doesn&#39;t count.  It printed quite well for a web page - did you do something<br/>
special to make page break correctly?  If you have page controls for<br/>
printing, I would suggest having fewer songs on the first page and making<br/>
the abbreviation key a &quot;footer&quot; so it repeats on both pages.  I keep my<br/>
sheet in a plastic cover right next to my keyboard and refer to it alot.<br/>
Having the key on both sides would be handy.<br/>
<br/>
All in all - it looks really great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch Rokenn!!! (and John too as i imagine this is part of your<br/>
joint effort? or is his ananysis coming later?)<br/>

I have taken the feedback from this list and the Concert Hall message board <br/>
and put together a website with your collected wisdom. Check it out and let <br/>
me know what you think :)<br/>
