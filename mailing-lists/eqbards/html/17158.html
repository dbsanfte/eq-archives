<div id="ygrps-yiv-903888306">I generally find myself the first to die in groups I&#39;m in, too.  It&#39;s part<br/>
of what I expect from the game and it&#39;s ALL of the reason my GF is 45 while<br/>
I&#39;m still 41.  Well, almost all, I usually find a way to die every so often<br/>
out of pure stupidity :)  Like last night after banking in High Hold, I<br/>
decided to check out how green the mobs were to me in the basement.  I<br/>
waltzed on down there figuring it was camped and all of a sudden I&#39;m getting<br/>
beat on by gobs, which of at least 1 was blue. :)  I didn&#39;t want to train<br/>
the groups that were upstairs so I decided to try and fight them<br/>
unprepared... I &quot;almost&quot; lived, managing to keep 1 charmed and keep the<br/>
other 2 tied up  for awhile.  Finally 1 mob died, which I got the exp for,<br/>
and of the remaining 2 mobs, the mob I didn&#39;t charm next decided he liked me<br/>
much more than my new pet.... thankfully, my GF talked a level 50 cleric<br/>
that happened to be banking there to rez me... net loss of 1/4 bubble of exp<br/>
and a little pride. :)<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion to you would be either a) camp out of the beaten (read: train)<br/>
path or b) move out of the zones where trains are more frequent.  I ended up<br/>
trading my Lambent BP for the sleeves and boots because any time I walked<br/>
into Sol A, I ended up dead.  The trade was WELL worth it to me.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure your level, but I&#39;d suggest moving to Cazic at the earliest possible<br/>
convenience.  4C&#39;s is train free.  And if you&#39;re careful, you&#39;re typically<br/>
fighting when ready and only what you want to.<br/>
