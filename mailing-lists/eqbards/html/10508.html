&gt; They want you because they see you as a mana stone.  I&#39;d say forget about<br/>
&gt; any offense songs in battle - maybe try CoD if you want to weave something<br/>

&gt; - use a drum - do you have MM drums? When you have the MR buffs stacked make<br/>
&gt; sure you have them check their MR you will here stuff like &quot;holy moly MR 130<br/>
&gt; woo hoo!&quot; and esp if someone else has MR buffed the party.  Also, they will<br/>
&gt; resist the fear and such - really fun to see this in Kith where the mob use<br/>
&gt; so much magic and melee hard too.<br/>

answering them.  Nice to see you&#39;ve &quot;come of age.&quot;  :-)<br/>
