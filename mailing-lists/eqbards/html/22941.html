<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427176817">Course, now I&#39;ve learned that if a group is &quot;adequate&quot;, they&#39;ll not want to<br/>
add more members<br/>
<br/>
*** I was in one of these just the other night.  We had pickup group with a<br/>
17 Wiz, 16 cleric, 15 druid, and 15 rogue (me).  A 17 monk wanted in and<br/>
the druid protested saying the XP would be split too thin.  No one else in<br/>
the group agreed with him and I&#39;m happy to report the monk got in.<br/>
<br/>
Grouping with that druid gave me knew insight into what sort of people<br/>
might worship the yellow bar:<br/>
<br/>
1) When he discovered he needed to sell he did a &quot;/g Gotta go sell.  Bye.&quot;<br/>
and disbanded during a pull.<br/>
2) He announced later &quot;/g I&#39;m leaving as soon as I ding, just so you know.&quot;<br/>
3) He asked &quot;/g Is it ok if I work on my 2hb skills?  I won&#39;t be hitting<br/>
for much.&quot;  Which prompted me to /tell a friend and groupmate &quot;Is it OK if<br/>
I go work on my swimming skills?&quot;<br/>
4) He would &quot;/g Get it off me&quot; when down one bubble and only made a serious<br/>
attempt to pull of another groupmate if it was the wizard and the wizard<br/>
was very badly hurt.  (Why not the cleric?  The cleric had better armor<br/>
than him)<br/>
<br/>
In closing: he was an @$$&*(#$.<br/>
<br/>
To his credit, at one point someone trained on us VERY deliberately and he<br/>
got two of the red mobs attention and ran them clear of the group before<br/>
zoning.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not spent much time with Atonal lately.  I just don&#39;t have the time to<br/>
dedicate anymore to 60% group hunting, 20% travel, and a measly 20% doing<br/>
what I want...grouped and fighting.  I&#39;d join my guild mates...if the<br/>
lowest<br/>
didn&#39;t outlevel me by about 15 levels.<br/>
<br/>
*** I know the feeling.  My bard is currently between guilds, and trying to<br/>
get her into one (Aegis Wolves, if you&#39;ve heard of them) is proving<br/>
extremely difficult because I can never find a guild member on under level<br/>
30.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
