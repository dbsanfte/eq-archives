<div id="ygrps-yiv-452045786"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Clavicus still sings Hymn in the Planes. (and fills up one&#39;s screen<br/>
&gt; doing it. Clavicus&#39;s song ends....) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, which people get tired of really, really quick.<br/>
  Plus my twist does kill me from clicking so much. <br/>
  When I&#39;m on the Planes it&#39;s basically a flirtfest: lots of typing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I know I have seen -- Clarity (of course), the &quot;Bind Sight&quot;<br/>
&gt; song (Windsong saw Clavicus using this. And then did it in Fear the<br/>
&gt; other night to help choose pulls)<br/>
  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s nice for looking around, in Fear the monsters tend to pull you<br/>
  and not vice versa ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Chains when snare won&#39;t hold for one reason or another. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ll chain once in a while, usually too high magic resistance<br/>
  on the planes to do this (even with debuffs) - depends on the mob.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She doesn&#39;t seem to think her songs are worthless at all. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I never said our songs are worthless, I said other than 3 or<br/>
  4, they are all outlived or underpowered.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve even seen her sit down between battles and mem new songs! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ouch... she must not know what she&#39;s doing then.  I never need<br/>
  to remem any songs once my lineup is set.  You don&#39;t even have<br/>
  8 songs you could apply to any given Planes scenario anyway, heh.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, when it comes to fighting, she is in their swinging with the rest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Swinging and missing, unlike the rest.  It&#39;s not that our dual wield<br/>
  sucks, or that our weapons blow, or even our offense, I swing a whole<br/>
  lot, more than all the other tanks, I just miss all the time.  Or I<br/>
  get riposted or parried.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have never heard her complain about being a level 50 bard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Well, some people are content with being mediocre, I&#39;m not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bards are EAGERLY desired by Phoenix on the planes, to the point they<br/>
&gt; are encouraged to come even to Fear where no bard armor drops until<br/>
&gt; they are sick of it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, bards are encouraged to come when people want their fix, and <br/>
  when it&#39;s time to do Draco, otherwise we are pretty much tagalongs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did you know a level 7 bard can take out yellow giant wasps solo?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Did you know a level 50 bard cannot solo a L34 npc guard? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  Things change completely at higher levels, tactics are almost <br/>
  meaningless.  HP/AC/Dmg output are everything.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
