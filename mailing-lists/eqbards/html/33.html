<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756047430">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I took the following from the enchanter message board. The work is <br/>
not mine. I find it hard to find a flaw in his figures, the really scary <br/>
figure for bards(Hybrids) is when he states a 50th level fighter has <br/>
the same xp as a 36th level Bard.<br/>

<br/>
Well, after several hours of testing, I found out some very interesting<br/>
information about experience levels.<br/>
<br/>
Using humans for all tests to avoid any racially based experience <br/>
handicaps,<br/>
I slew enough snakes in North Qeynos and West Freeport to <br/>
establish the<br/>
following experience gaining &quot;tiers&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
1) Warriors, Rogues, and Wisdom-Based Casters gained 0.55 <br/>
bubbles per snake<br/>
kill.<br/>
2) Intelligence-Based Casters gained half a bubble per snake kill.<br/>
3) Monks gained 0.45 bubbles per snake kill.<br/>
4) Bards and Hybrid Classes gained 0.4 bubbles per snake kill.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can say that, assuming tier 1 requires (X) raw <br/>
experience<br/>
point for a level:<br/>
<br/>
1) Warriors, Rogues, and Wisdom-Based Casters require (X).<br/>
2) Intelligence-Based Casters require 1.1(X).<br/>
3) Monks require 1.22(X).<br/>
4) Bards and Hybrid Classes require 1.375(X).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wis-Based&quot; are the Cleric & Druid.<br/>
&quot;Int-Based&quot; are the Enchanter, Magician, Wizard, and <br/>
Necromancer.<br/>
&quot;Hybrids&quot; are the Ranger, Paladin, and ShadowKnight.<br/>
<br/>
After I&#39;m done with finals I plan to test the experience gain of <br/>
different<br/>
races compared to humans (ie. halfling cleric vs human cleric).<br/>
<br/>
-- What does it mean? --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not certain whether it is right to say that, for example, when a <br/>
warrior<br/>
reaches level 50, a hybrid with the same amount of experience <br/>
would be<br/>
around level (50 * (.40/.55)) = 36; regardless of the exact level, it is<br/>
obvious that this puts hybrids at a disadvantage, as far as climbing <br/>
levels<br/>
with a minimal amount of fighting.<br/>
Now, rumour has it that the experience split among group <br/>
members is NOT<br/>
proportional to experience LEVEL, but rather to total experience <br/>
points.<br/>
This means that, if the above formula holds true, a level 14 hybrid <br/>
would<br/>
share experience equally with a level 20 warrior.<br/>
Now, where this might be a point of concern, is in a party setting <br/>
with all<br/>
party members being recruited at the same experience level. This <br/>
means that<br/>
the hybrid, due to requiring greater experience to REACH the <br/>
current level,<br/>
gains a greater share of the experience than you might have <br/>
suspected.<br/>
<br/>
-- Numbers --<br/>
<br/>
group 1 -- 3 warriors.<br/>
Each warrior&#39;s share is 33% of the XP<br/>
group 2 -- 2 warriors, 1 paladin.<br/>
Each warrior recieves 30% of the XP, and the paladin gets 40%<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER if you consider that the paladin does the work of a <br/>
warrior AND a<br/>
cleric (debatable), you can look at this group composition:<br/>
group 3 -- 2 warriors, (1 warrior and 1 cleric)<br/>
Each warrior gets 25% of the XP, as does the cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you can look at the flipside, when the entire group is hybrid <br/>
and<br/>
one odd-man-out is a &quot;quick-gainer&quot;<br/>
<br/>
group 4 -- 1 warrior, 2 paladins<br/>
Here the warrior gains 27% of the XP, and each paladin gains 37%.<br/>
<br/>
-- Possible problems --<br/>
<br/>
Assumptions:<br/>
1) All creatures which are labelled &quot;a snake&quot;, and live in either West<br/>
Freeport or North Qeynos, yield the same experience.<br/>
2) Stats do not affect experience gain.<br/>
<br/>
The Shaman is untested, as humans cannot be shamans. <br/>
However, I expect that<br/>
this class falls under wis-based caster.<br/>
I also did not have time to test the Wizard and Shadowknight; I am <br/>
just<br/>
assuming that they follow the pattern set forth by similar classes.<br/>
<br/>
This data was taken today, April 18th, 1999. Who knows, all these<br/>
observations might be invalidated with the next patch.<br/>
