<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045092932">Um...Kristin...there&#39;s another room in the guild. Through the inner doors, are two<br/>
more song merchants. They have the 8 and 9th level songs.<br/>

&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I am new to this list and have read two digests so far. I just reached<br/>
&gt; 8th level a few days ago and was curious about a few things.<br/>
&gt; My bardess resides in Kelethin and the guild there only sells songs up to the<br/>
&gt; 7th level song. I am curious as to where I would obtain the rest of the songs.<br/>
&gt; Not sure where to start looking for them or if they are quests. The guild leader<br/>
&gt; in Kelethin only gives out drums for four spiderling silks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would like for the information either on the list or emailed to me directly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kristin- Wood elf of Kelethin<br/>
&gt; 8th level Bardess<br/>
