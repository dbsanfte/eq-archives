<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906625178">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that nobody seems to know how Jaxan&#39;s Jig can be helpful...<br/>
one of the websites mentioned that it increases the recovery pulse rate for<br/>
all three bars (not just stamina) from approximately 8sec/pulse to 6<br/>
sec/pulse.  So what? Well, what this means is:<br/>
<br/>
- If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana<br/>
regen <br/>
  (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>
- If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should<br/>
increase at the <br/>
  same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one) <br/>
<br/>
Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even<br/>
more critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this<br/>
information, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t<br/>
even try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still<br/>
an upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of<br/>
Jaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-)<br/>
