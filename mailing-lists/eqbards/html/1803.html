<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048931297">I&#39;m PRETTY sure that magicians can give away summoned daggers.  It&#39;s a lvl 4<br/>
or 8 spell.  That&#39;s what my magician uses, though I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know<br/>
the stats, but the delay is fairly good..  If someone else takes your<br/>
advice, but is broke, they might want to ask a magician for one.  The mana<br/>
cost is negligible, so they shouldn&#39;t charge you.  You might talk a higher<br/>
level magician into summoning you a giant snake fang.  I have NO clue on<br/>
what those stats are, though.<br/>
