<div id="ygrps-yiv-865370468">Yes, this song is definitely faster than sow.  However, since the <br/>
root/snare/accelerando snafu, there has been a bug similar to the <br/>
very old problem where the song doesn&#39;t start working properly until <br/>
after you zone.  Seems to mainly occur if you log out with the song <br/>
running, then log back in. The song will then not speed you up until <br/>
after you zone.  I /petitioned this.  Dunno if they fixed it yet.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just dinged 51 last night and used this song for the first time.  <br/>
With<br/>
&gt; Selos<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drum equipped, the movement rate with the 51 song seemed to be <br/>
slower than<br/>
&gt; &gt; Selos Accelerando.  I was in Burning Woods so that may have had <br/>
an impact<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; my perception.  Is the speed bonus for these songs the same or is<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s the airplane effect. When your way up high it seems like your <br/>
going<br/>
&gt; very slowly, even though your crusing at mach1.I thought this also <br/>
when I<br/>
&gt; first started playing with the song. But it&#39;s faster, trust me :) </span></blockquote></div>
