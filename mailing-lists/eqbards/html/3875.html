<div id="ygrps-yiv-399548321">I find you can usually trust /con... <br/>
<br/>
The big exceptions seem to be, it seems, dark elves!<br/>
<br/>
Dorn, Dvinn, Kizdean Gix... all of them are just CRAZY for their /con<br/>
level.  I remember when I first fought Dorn (don&#39;t remember my level),<br/>
he was a &quot;blue risky&quot; to me.  I had a magician, same level as I, and her<br/>
pet with me.  Usually, in a situation like that, I&#39;d lose about 2<br/>
bubbles of health, and that&#39;s it.  <br/>
<br/>
We camped him for a while.  In 5 fights, he knocked me out twice<br/>
(without killing me), and did the same to the magician once.  He killed<br/>
3 pets.  I never ended a fight with more than a bubble.  <br/>
