<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222847544">Yep, and MOBs of similar types who are in range of each other &quot;share&quot; their <br/>
list. Of course, all MOBs in Unrest do share (thus the non agro beetles <br/>
attacking to support undeads).<br/>
What happened is that the hag came in range of your target and saw you <br/>
(well, you the original sender) so high on the list that she prefered to get <br/>
you instead of that paladin, well, that&#39;s my guess.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The main reason the Hag went for you was not because you were<br/>
&gt; &gt; a Bard, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; because you were buffing everyone in your party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes.. this is precisely what is causing it.   The reason bards seem to be <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;a lot of these situations is because they&#39;re usually constantly buffing<br/>
&gt;everyone all the time.  For an experiment, pull something w/o singing any<br/>
&gt;songs.  Have any nearby caster buff anyone in the party just as the MOB is<br/>
&gt;coming into range.  Chances are the MOB will bee-line towards the caster (I<br/>
&gt;just saw this multiple times lastnight when a druid would buff damage<br/>
&gt;shields at the beginning of a pull - the MOB invariably went straight at <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;druid)<br/>
