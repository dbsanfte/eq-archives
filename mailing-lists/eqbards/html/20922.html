<br/>
Who Cares?<br/>
<br/>
If I find myself in a group with people whining and bitching about exp<br/>
penalties, I politely excuse myself and leave. I play this game to have fun,<br/>
not to maximize exp for each encounter, and certainly not to put up with<br/>
some 12 year old who can&#39;t seem to level fast enough.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, the bard of all classes is least affected by the &quot;exp<br/>
penalty&quot; problem because we increase the effectiveness of the party so<br/>
significantly that we more than make up for the exp we are &quot;taking&quot; by<br/>
increasing the total amount of kills the group can handle.<br/>
<br/>
Now for a dose of realism. The game has been live for more than a year. You<br/>
will not see any changes in the exp tables, nor are you likely to see any<br/>
changes in the way exp is awarded. It&#39;s just not going to happen, it&#39;s too<br/>
late in the game, so we might as well focus our efforts on something that<br/>
has a chance of happening.<br/>
<br/>
My major gripe with this game is that everyone who plays automatically<br/>
thinks they are qualified to be a game designer. This is not directed to you<br/>
Elwyn, but towards the myriad of fools who post constantly to the official<br/>
message boaards thinking that since everyone would like a change it should<br/>
be implemented. People need to realize that this is not a majority rule and<br/>
that just because players want something, doesn&#39;t mean it is good for the<br/>
game. This game would suck if there were no penalty for dying. It would be<br/>
bad if transportation were instant. And it would not hold our attention long<br/>
if planar armor dropped like candy. Granted there are many flaws in the<br/>
system. (Bard armor could drop a little more frequently) But overall, I<br/>
think this game is awesome. I&#39;ve played for 48 levels on my main character,<br/>
23 on my secondary and taken several others to 12 or higher. I can honestly<br/>
say that I can see myself continuting to play my characters for quite some<br/>
time. This is not the case with games like Baldur&#39;s Gate, where the instant<br/>
I was done I had lost all interest in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I have to fall on the side of Verant. I&#39;ve seen many beneficial<br/>
changes over the life of my character. And I truely believe that the EQ<br/>
world is a better place than when it was originally released. Whenever I<br/>
think about something game that I find annoying, like some of our songs<br/>
being broken, I remember that the death penalty used to be twice what it is<br/>
and then I feel better.<br/>
<br/>
So, it seems like Abashi is completely ignorant of our concerns about our<br/>
songs. This says to me 2 things...<br/>
<br/>
1) They aren&#39;t ignoring us. Instead they just have no idea that we think<br/>
there is a problem that needs to be looked at. Abashi is a busy man, I&#39;m<br/>
willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that he missed our<br/>
posts or forgot them.<br/>
<br/>
2) If we can make them aware of what we think is wrong, then we can get them<br/>
to look at it and there is a possibility that we can get it fixed. This to<br/>
me is good news. The only problem is how to get our thoughts looked at. I<br/>
suggest we write up a concise description of the problems. (insane resist<br/>
rates on pixie strike and lullaby and ineffectiveness of snare since the<br/>
patch) then we post it to the bug board and the gameplay board, as well as<br/>
emailing it to abashi.<br/>

The hybrid penalty is a HUGE problem.  If it worked like it did in AD&D,<br/>
fine, that would be one thing.  The problem is not that a class is slower to<br/>
level, but rather that having a hybrid in your group makes the whole group<br/>
level slower.  This unfairly penalizes your group members for what is<br/>
supposed to be your penalty.<br/>
When a kill is made, every member of the party is not given an equal number<br/>
of xp points.  No, every member is given a percentage of the total xp based<br/>
on how much xp they currently have.<br/>
<br/>
Lets take the most extreme example.  A group of 5 troll shadow knights<br/>
(highest xp penalty) and 1 halfling rogue (lowest xp penalty).  Lets assume<br/>
they&#39;re all the same level and they kill a monster worth 600xp.  Now you<br/>
think the intelligent thing would be to give each member of the group 100xp<br/>
each, but no, that&#39;s not how it works.  In this example, each troll SK would<br/>
get 108xp, and the poor halfling rogue would get 55xp.  The logic is that<br/>
the halfling needs less xp to level, so he gets less.  The problem is that<br/>
this system totally eliminates the idea of having a class that&#39;s easier to<br/>
level.  The poor little halfling got screwed by the hybrids in his group.<br/>
Replace all those troll SK&#39;s with non-hybrids, and suddenly our halfling is<br/>
getting twice the xp, and leveling twice as fast.<br/>
<br/>
Now granted, this is an extreme example, but every time you add a hybrid to<br/>
your group, the ability of the group to level quickly is decreased.  So you<br/>
tell me, who pays the penalty?  Hybrids?  Or those forced to group with<br/>
them?<br/>

I still get a kick out of people thinking there is some kind of XP &quot;penalty&quot;<br/>
for being a hybrid.  It&#39;s not a &quot;penalty&quot; it&#39;s just harder to level certain<br/>
classes than it is to level others.  This is due to varying benefits that<br/>
each class has.   Go look at an AD&D players handbook and look at the xp<br/>
differences for each class.  If you look in a 1st Edition one you can even<br/>
look at bards and realize that they are the single hardest class in AD&D to<br/>
level (had to level to 10 in warrior, 10 in thief then switch to bard and<br/>
level on an xp curve comparable to that of a paladin.).<br/>
