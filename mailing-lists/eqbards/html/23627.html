&gt; &gt; speaking of the issues of bad bards, wonder if we could get that fabulous<br/>
&gt; &gt; FAQ posted on the Concert Hall. It might possibly help the new crop of<br/>
&gt; &gt; bardlings.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The 49 song is Shield of Song.  Melody of Erjav is 50th not 49th.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Either way, I took out the FAQ ;)<br/>
<br/>
This is why I ask youse guys to read it once in a while.  I don&#39;t play <br/>
anymore (although I have a friend at work who comes and tells me of his <br/>
conquests from the night before EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! *GAAAAHHH!!!*), so I <br/>
miss a lot.  I just refuse to give money to Verant until they prove that <br/>
they&#39;ve changed.  I still don&#39;t see it.<br/>
