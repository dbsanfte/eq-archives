<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888805385">Yep your 100% correct.  I&#39;m the one who mistakely thought you could sing the<br/>
song without a lute.  My bad.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan answered one of my questions (the song is not used to remove positive<br/>
buffs from mobs).  I haven&#39;t seen a reply to the second question I asked so<br/>
once more:<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried playing the 22d level song while under the influence of a<br/>
negative spell, with a lute equipped, and themselves targetted (by hitting<br/>
the F1 key or left-clicking on their name).  The times I have tried to use<br/>
this song in the past I have not had myself targetted.  I just assumed it<br/>
worked like our other songs and did not require targetting yourself.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t been hit with a negative spell since I posted the question so<br/>
haven&#39;t had the chance to test it out for myself.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;One other possibility.  Are we 100% certain that the song <br/>
&gt; &gt;is supposed to remove negative buffs from us?  What if the <br/>
&gt; &gt;song removes positive buffs from a mob?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 110% sure.  This song is party only.  Kinda tough to apply it<br/>
&gt; to NPCs, when it&#39;s _only_ party only.  The static pulse is<br/>
&gt; meant to clear out negative effects (which it doesnt).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This song is lute _only_, you cannot sing it.<br/>
&gt; We need to be more careful when posting things like this,<br/>
&gt; clearly you can tell if you get the message:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You must be using a String Instrument when playing this song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In order to make more sense of things like this, everyone needs<br/>
&gt; to take note of everything that occured.  Saying this song can<br/>
&gt; be sung is just plain incorrect.  It starts more rumors, which<br/>
&gt; we must dispell... it&#39;s ashame this song does help that ;-)<br/>
