<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127803953">Hehe, last time I was in Lower Guk there was a level 50 wiz trying to get<br/>
in a group. She had been /ooc&#39;ing for about 25 minutes and then in a last<br/>
desperate attempt to get in a group she /ooc&#39;d Trading Exec Axe for place<br/>
in a group. She soon got a response after that, and it was funny reading<br/>
people&#39;s replies. /ooc Heh, I&#39;ll boot one of my group and you can join j/k.<br/>

PS. Can anyone tell me what level Greater Ice bones are, I was in the<br/>
bedroom in L Guk with my group and we had cleared the area. I went round<br/>
the corner towards the Assasin room and there were 3 Gtr Ice bones, all<br/>
conned red to me at level 30 so I didn&#39;t risk pulling them. My group was<br/>
made up of 29 Druid, 30 Bard (me), 30 Paladin and 34 Mage (with fire pet).<br/>
Would we of been able to take them?<br/>

&gt;         SolB is so camped on E&#39;ci the line to get in starts in Nek<br/>
&gt; Forest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Lower guk live-side is the place you wanna be, much less<br/>
&gt; camped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I read these posts about clearing all the greater kobolds<br/>
&gt; and just<br/>
&gt;         chuckle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         If you can get in to SolB, and are able to pull more than 3<br/>
&gt; kobolds<br/>
&gt;         then go for it, I&#39;m sure the birthday man is right.<br/>
