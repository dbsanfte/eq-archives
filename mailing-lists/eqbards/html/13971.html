<b>Subject:</b> RE: Mistmoore Castle (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-860009965">You want Mynthi Davissi for the Mistmoore Battle Drums (she also drops the<br/>
&quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; which *is not* the right lute for the quest).<br/>
Mynthi is an enchanter and she spawns in the same room with the &quot;a gypsy<br/>
musicians&quot; that carry the &quot;a gypsy lute&quot; which is what you need for the BP<br/>
quest.  At night Mynthi will spawn as a werewolf and is considerably easier<br/>
to take imo because she&#39;s apparently not an enchanter while in werewolf<br/>
form.  She has dropped the MM drums for me in werewolf form.  The &quot;a gypsy<br/>
musicians&quot; are terribly easy to kill as they just melee, and they visibly<br/>
hold the lute when they have it.  Your 50 monk would destroy them.<br/>
<br/>
There are two rooms right near one another in the castle that have pianos in<br/>
them.  If you&#39;re in a small room with windows to the outside you&#39;re in the<br/>
&quot;music room&quot;.  That&#39;s wrong - you want the &quot;ballroom&quot; which is slightly<br/>
larger and has no windows.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re pulling the ballroom where Minthi and the gypsy musicians are<br/>
(especially with a 50 pulling) it is crucial in my opinion to know about the<br/>
secret hallway.  On Fennin Ro the people that know about this hall call it<br/>
the &quot;Safe Hall&quot; since no mobs wander through it except for a very rare green<br/>
familiar.  The Safe Hall runs parallel to the ballroom (sorry I don&#39;t know<br/>
if it&#39;s E-W or N-S) and is hidden by secret walls on either end of it.<br/>
Wandering mobs cannot see you in here, even through the non-tangible walls.<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;Safe&quot;.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Visualize yourself coming in through the front of MM castle.  You pass<br/>
through the gate and go around the foyer area into the large entry hall<br/>
where the gargs are, and from there into the low short hall that leads to<br/>
the ballroom.  After entering that hall you either have to turn to the left<br/>
or right around a wall to access that ballroom and gypsies.  If you turn<br/>
left 90 degrees and take a few paces you will be able to turn right 90<br/>
degrees and enter the ballroom proper.  Instead entering the ballroom take<br/>
about 3 more paces forward toward the Negotiator&#39;s room door.  There is a<br/>
short piece of wall on your right between the ballroom and the Negotiator&#39;s<br/>
room door that you can walk through.  If you walk through it you will be in<br/>
the Safe Hall.  The hall is as long as the ballroom.  If you exit the other<br/>
end of the Safe Hall you will be in a hallway with 4 stationary gargs.  Turn<br/>
right and you&#39;ll be standing at the double doors that lead into the ballrom<br/>
from the other side, right near where Mynthi Davissi spawns.  When my 50<br/>
druid was pulling, he would leave the Safe Hall, turn right, open the double<br/>
doors and hit Mynthi with a spell (we were after drums) and then pull her<br/>
into the Safe Hall.  This was tricky with her cause she&#39;s a caster and liked<br/>
to stand her ground, but he was able to do it several times despite this.<br/>
Have your 50 monk pull singles into the hall and you&#39;ll be there happy as<br/>
clams for hours.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things I learned while pulling here.  My 50 druid was agrod on<br/>
by everything in sight and we have to run for the zone each time he pulled<br/>
while I was playing songs - the fact that a 40th bard was buffing him was<br/>
apparent to the mobs.  Every time he left the safe hall when I was not<br/>
playing songs everything went very smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned a few weeks back, I found that if I pressed up against the<br/>
walls of the Safe Hall (was touching them) while playing songs I was very<br/>
likely to agro things in the room on the other side of the wall.  It took me<br/>
twice of agroing the entire Negotiator&#39;s room onto us through the wall to<br/>
figure out what the problem was.  No problems occured when I didn&#39;t touch<br/>
the wall.  I think we &quot;poke through&quot;.<br/>

&gt; I am posting this as I need some info/help to obtain the Gypsy<br/>
&gt; Lute for the<br/>
&gt; Lambent BP Quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night me (35 bard), 50 monk, 40 Mage, 35 Druid and 35<br/>
&gt; Paladin made our<br/>
&gt; way to the music room by having the monk pull, he could pull things solo,<br/>
&gt; we eventually held the music/piano room, that was until the monk pulled<br/>
&gt; about 10 things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I somehow managed to run from the music room and make it to the zone with<br/>
&gt; about 20 hp&#39;s left. The Paladin died the monk FD&#39;d and the casters gated.<br/>
&gt; Druid failed the evac as he was getting a beating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had to go after this and never got the chance to get a lute, although I<br/>
&gt; got the black silk gloves (in case you don&#39;t know, I am getting a friend<br/>
&gt; full Lambent in return for a Yak). All I need to know is was I in<br/>
&gt; the right<br/>
&gt; place to get the lute, who drops it and is it a rare drop?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many Thanks<br/>
