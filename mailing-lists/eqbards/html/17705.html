<div id="ygrps-yiv-641884048">Hi fellow bards!<br/>
<br/>
I need some information assistance. We are having an event on my server,<br/>
Karana, on Saturday. We are having a chessmatch at the chessboard with duels.<br/>
Different level players have been chosen for the role&#39;s of King, Queen,<br/>
Bishop, Rooks and Pawns. I volunteered to be there because my guild has a<br/>
major role in the event. I am a Level 11 bard. I figured I would be asked to<br/>
assist in the organization of the event. However, I have been chosen as a<br/>
PAWN! Could anyone advise me on the best strategy to employ to possibly come<br/>
out of this alive? I know I am probably being vague as to some of the rules of<br/>
the game but that is because they are still being determined. I do know that<br/>
charming will not be allowed. Only self-buffs will be allowed. DOT&#39;s are<br/>
allowed. <br/>
<br/>
I am still in the process of figuring out how to be the best bard that I can<br/>
be and I have a lot to learn. So I look to each of you......the experts!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any assistance you could give me!<br/>
