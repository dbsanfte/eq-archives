<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-773343379">Dual wield does not require you to have weapons with different delays, thats<br/>
for pets only.<br/>
<br/>
I always tried to wield a different weapon typein my off hand than in my<br/>
primary.  It helped me keep all 3 skills maxxed.  THere is not inherant<br/>
advantage in doing this though.  If your skills are maxxed (or you don&#39;t<br/>
care) just wield your two best weapons.<br/>
<br/>
When you initially get dual wield, put your fastest weapon off hand, this<br/>
will help your skill go up quickly, but once it is capped (which will take<br/>
about a level), go with your two best weapons.  At lvl 18 I actually went to<br/>
the triple song attack and soloed to 22.  (heal song, chords of discord w/<br/>
mandolin and DDD with horn)</div>
