&gt; The bard is a grouping character so, IMO, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really important you both learn to play in groups as early as possible<br/>
&gt; and start building up a circle of friends who appreciate what a bard can<br/>
&gt; do as early as you can. It pays off in the long run, believe me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I cannot emphasize this enough.  Lately (L21), I&#39;ve found the<br/>
problem of me being the mob magnet has mostly gone away.  It<br/>
still happens in trains, but when we&#39;re fighting one mob, just<br/>
about any tank is able to keep it off me if I&#39;m doing Anthem,<br/>
Bellow, Bellow, or Anthem, Heal, Bellow.  I was in Cazic with<br/>
a rogue (22) and paladin (20 with SBH) and I actually had to<br/>
throw in Binding every now and then to get the mobs to attack<br/>
me to better distribute the damage between us.  I use a Dirk<br/>
and Barbed Whip btw, probably the two best damage ratio<br/>
weapons around my level, so it&#39;s not like my weapons suck.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched people my level fight solo in many zones, and<br/>
bards just are not capable of holding out against the same<br/>
mobs the others are.  Paladins, rangers, shadowknights, mages,<br/>
druids, can just plain cream mobs that would send me running<br/>
before I&#39;ve gotten them down much below half life.  Sure if<br/>
lots of people are beating on a mob so that it&#39;ll die before<br/>
you do, you *might* be able to get the kill with Warsong,<br/>
Bellow, Bellow.  But we just don&#39;t have the hp/defense to stay<br/>
the long haul when soloing.  The strength of our class when<br/>
soloing is the short downtimes.  I sometimes exploit this when<br/>
soloing by fighting a mob to below half (with me down to under<br/>
two bubbles), running and healing back to full, then stopping<br/>
to finish off the mob.<br/>
<br/>
So the bard is flexible enough that (I&#39;ve found up to L21)<br/>
you&#39;ll always be able to solo one way or another, but you will<br/>
do much much much better when grouped.  And the group will<br/>
love you because you endow them with your short downtime<br/>
advantage.<br/>
