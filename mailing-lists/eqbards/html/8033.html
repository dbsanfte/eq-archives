&gt; I think this is due to the fact that you&#39;re not close enough.  I&#39;ve had the<br/>
&gt; same thing happen to me fighting a handful of creatures.  I get the<br/>
&gt; &quot;graphic&quot; but no message whatsoever (even though I&#39;m in melee range).  I<br/>
&gt; usually just take a few steps closer and let it pulse again, then it seems<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I thought at first too.  But I specifically tried<br/>
not moving after I got one of these no-messages, and<br/>
eventually the song worked or was resisted.  Another time I<br/>
actually moved directly underneath/inside a mammoth and still<br/>
had the no-messages.  Stood there a bit and eventually the<br/>
song worked.  Maybe we should bug it.<br/>
