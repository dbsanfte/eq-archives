&gt; I think this is due to the fact that you&#39;re not close enough.  I&#39;ve had the<br/>

&gt; &quot;graphic&quot; but no message whatsoever (even though I&#39;m in melee range).  I<br/>

not moving after I got one of these no-messages, and<br/>
eventually the song worked or was resisted.  Another time I<br/>
actually moved directly underneath/inside a mammoth and still<br/>
had the no-messages.  Stood there a bit and eventually the<br/>
song worked.  Maybe we should bug it.<br/>
