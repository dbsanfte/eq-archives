<div id="ygrps-yiv-651939101">Agreed my point (which I didn&#39;t elucidate) I find a lot of clerics who seem<br/>
to think that C Heal is the only heal they need to keep memmed and only heal<br/>
when everyone gets that low.  It seems to me downtime is the lowest when<br/>
done exactly as you describe.<br/>

Good clerics keep remedy or sup heal memmed to keep the enchanters and other<br/>
alive.  When I see an ench or bard-ench dropping down a bub, I am casting a<br/>
heal their way (yes, I play a cleric too.)  If I get 2 &quot;tanks&quot; who try to<br/>
play like this, I remind them  that the designated tank is gonna get<br/>
(c)healed and mention that I hope the other guy has a lot of bandaids along.<br/>
<br/>
The cleric can heal - but he cant keep the whole group healed unless they<br/>
cooperate and help manage who gets the damage.  I will ask bards and ragners<br/>
and any others to not melee, or to back out of the melee, or switch weapons<br/>
if they are getting too much of the damage (and not the designated tanks.)</div>
