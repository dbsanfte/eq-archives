<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724481980">that&#39;s a totally bogus poll anyway.  in groups?  solo?  fighting blues?<br/>
fighting reds?  what level?  what kind of equipment?<br/>
<br/>
you get a different answer depending on how you answer those<br/>

&gt;You can bypass voting if you want by just clicking on &quot;View the Results&quot;. I <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t mean to start a grip session. As a bard I consider us quite powerful, <br/>
&gt;but then again, I&#39;m level 38 and pretty much loving life as I&#39;m able to do <br/>
&gt;all the things a bard can, without just getting the &quot;sing manasong only&quot; <br/>
&gt;too often.<br/>
