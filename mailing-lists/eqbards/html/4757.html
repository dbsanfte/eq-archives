<b>Subject:</b> Button Quest or &quot;Death to Twisting&quot; or How to make Bards more Fun or  Please improve the interface! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766371564"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I know the interface will not support this right now.  The interface treats<br/>
&gt; bards like casters, but that does not mean they can&#39;t alter the interface to<br/>
&gt; accomodate this request.  Add a Harmony Ability (See Definitions below, esp<br/>
&gt; #4a, courtesy of Meriam Webster&#39;s Online Dictionary).  This &quot;Harmony&quot;<br/>
&gt; Ability could take the form of a button on the Abilities menu.  The Bard<br/>
&gt; pushes the &quot;Harmony&quot; button and then depresses multiple songs in the order<br/>
&gt; the Bard wants to play them.  The Server then starts each song and<br/>
&gt; immediately shifts to the next song until the list is completed and then<br/>
&gt; returns to the top of the queue.  To stop the auto-playing of songs, hit the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Harmony&quot; button and resume manual control.  Simple enough?  The idea is not<br/>
&gt; without precedent.  [The auto-attack feature of the game is a similar form<br/>
&gt; of redundancy elimination (which could also be enhanced, similarly to what<br/>
&gt; is suggested here, to include special attacks like kick or bash or the<br/>
&gt; myriad Monk abilities).]  There will be some resistance, perhaps even<br/>
&gt; philosophical rejection, to any form of scripting, but keep in mind that<br/>
&gt; this change would be completely voluntary for the user.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Actually, though probably not something easily coded into the game,<br/>
this is a great idea to reduce the twitch-a-mania bards face. Heck,<br/>
nowadays when I am away from computer, I can see in my MIND the<br/>
damn hotbuttons (2 and 3, I always keep selo and hymn there) and<br/>
whenever I see people moving around or myself am walking, I am<br/>
mentally pressing the 2-key. I can see it depress, and soon flashy<br/>
balls around and thinking of moving faster =P I would not say I am<br/>
addicted, I would say the damn keypressing has burned into my head!<br/>
Though my gf probably has other notions about me not being addicted...<br/>
Now to think of it.. just yesterday left her place at 11pm to go home and<br/>
play instead of staying over (to you-know-what), so OK I am addicted.<br/>
A bit.. not much.. just a bit =P<br/>
