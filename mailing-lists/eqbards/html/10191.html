<div id="ygrps-yiv-111761775">There is a resource available that many people don&#39;t know about, but it is invaluable for answering<br/>
questions like, &quot;Does xxx song do this?  Or not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s eqss.stratics.com/spells<br/>
<br/>
This is actually the spell data file, parsed out for the web.<br/>
<br/>
Now much of it is meaningless (to me anyway), and it doesn&#39;t answer questions about song/spell<br/>
interactions, but this is a valuable resource for understanding spells and songs.<br/>
<br/>
I am not in anyway affiliated with this site, so don&#39;t ask me why things are why they are, it&#39;s just a<br/>
plug.<br/>
