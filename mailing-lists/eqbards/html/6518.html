typically wouldn&#39;t be quite as thick as the players you seem to<br/>
encounter. Being as you are L21 however, you probably won&#39;t be grouping<br/>
with too many as they probably are all higher level than you. As to<br/>
other servers, a newer server might have some smarter players, but<br/>
after the first few weeks they would probably outlevel you as well.<br/>

This is part of why I have grown tired of the game. Given there&#39;s not<br/>
much to do at L49 where I am now, I&#39;ve tried starting new characters<br/>
both on my own server and on new servers, and I really find the run of<br/>
the mill people I can find to group with to be extremely bad at playing<br/>
the game (in general, there obviously are exceptions) As I was in with<br/>
the group of people who were among first to make 50 on my server, I am<br/>
used to playing with people who are extremely good at playing their<br/>
characters and understand how to play well with other characters as<br/>
well. I can really sympathise now with the frustration of people playing<br/>
lower level characters trying to group as it&#39;s much harder to find good<br/>
players to group with from what I can see, unless you run across some<br/>
experienced players playing their other characters, and they are likely<br/>
to outlevel you quickly so you won&#39;t be able to play with them for long.<br/>
