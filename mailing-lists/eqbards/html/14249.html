&gt; On the other hand I have to take issue with calling Verant &quot;liars&quot;.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; recall the exact words they used - but it is possible that they whether we<br/>
&gt; agree with them or not - they may have &quot;fixed&quot; the song to work the way they<br/>
&gt; intended to.  Again - not sure of the wording - so perhaps they have been<br/>
&gt; less than forward if this is the case.  You could still call them liars in<br/>
&gt; this case - and it&#39;s a matter of semantics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just a point but the actual claim was that Verant are liars when they<br/>
claim they have someone testing the bard. I think this claim is valid,<br/>
as we have way too much evidence to show that no testing is done on the<br/>
bard before patching at all. Even testing of changes specific to the<br/>
bard. What other explanation is there for the fact that they go live<br/>
with code where new bard songs don&#39;t work, levitate changes completely<br/>
break the bard levitate song and other problems we&#39;ve seen. <br/>
<br/>
Another interesting thing I haven&#39;t seen anyone comment on. Last<br/>
(emergency) patch they said they had to put in some changes half<br/>
finished when they put in the fixes for the network code, i.e. the necro<br/>
pet changes. Don&#39;t any of the programmers on the list find it odd that<br/>
they don&#39;t appear to have some kind of source control system that would<br/>
allow patching of the currently running code so they didn&#39;t have to go<br/>
live with partly finished changes?<br/>
