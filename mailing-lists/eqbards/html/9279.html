<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-471897162">I got so bored that I started trying EVERYTHING!<br/>
<br/>
AE songs are NO problem in HK!  As long as Captian Lineaus or whoever has<br/>
not been trained downstairs and is not recruiting for extra help.<br/>
<br/>
AE songs are a GOOD THING in HK!  Play the BINDING song and slow the attack<br/>
speed! Use CHAIN (opps not AE) and stop the runners. If you are not doing<br/>
crowd control, play Chords - twist with hymm, stay out of melee if you have<br/>
enough tanks.  Side note - tanks in these ad hoc groups tend to be gung-ho<br/>
(ie real dumb) and each will attack their own mobs rather than assist a main<br/>
tank and focus and allow crowd control so chords can be wincing them both.<br/>
They are still young players so forgive them they know not what they do (and<br/>
they _will_ die in the next harder dungeons until they learn this lesson.)<br/>
If you have smart tanks or have smartened them up - play Lullaby and control<br/>
the 2 and 3 mob spawns.  You can have screetch loaded for emergency use only<br/>
- but I never used it. <br/>
<br/>
You wont affect the NPC&#39;s you see casting.  Every spot is so heavily camped<br/>
- you wont pull extra mobs either.  Another good tip is Psalm of Warmth -<br/>
not cause you face heat/cold based attacks but because it has that sweet<br/>
damage shield (burns the mob who hits a party member who is shielded) and<br/>
lowers their AC. <br/>
<br/>
So those are my tips and I have tried this at home for hours and hours,<br/>
<br/>

p.s. I may stop by and say hi from time to time but I am gladder that my<br/>
time in HK is over and done with.<br/>

		While camping on the first level of the basement one time I<br/>
kept getting<br/>
		messages that Princess Lenya was casting spells.  That<br/>
brought back bad<br/>
		memories of hags attacking me along the wall in Unrest due<br/>
to the z-axis<br/>
		bug.  I quickly deleted DDD from my song list and picked<br/>
another one to<br/>
		sing.  It might be safe to sing AE songs further down in the<br/>
rooms you<br/>
		mentioned but I would be very cautious on the first level of<br/>
the basement.<br/>
