<div id="ygrps-yiv-894809044"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   Shock of Force.  150ish dmg, stun, mostly resisted outright, but<br/>
&gt;   when I took a hit, it was 125ish dmg with over 100 MR.  That truly<br/>
&gt;   hurt me to see a L20 caster nuking me for almost full.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ok well that is an all or none spell, i got it at level 20 on my wizzie.  it<br/>
doesn&#39;t get partially resisted.  and did GZ say something about regardless<br/>
of level you have a 5% chance of landing?  i dunno, he got lucky.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   While some items produce CR/FR effects, not all items do.  So for<br/>
&gt;   a team so concerned with resistances as was said, why didn&#39;t they<br/>
&gt;   hit the bank and swap out gear for the next dragon?  Why didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;   they pickup another bard?  They had 3 or 4 groups, and only 2 bards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lot of people in my guild carry around their resist gear on them.  sometimes<br/>
if we have a shot at both dragons, we&#39;ll take out the first with one type of<br/>
gear and skip the bank because we are racing to get the other dragon ahead<br/>
of someone else.  no, like what you claim on your server we don&#39;t go after<br/>
dragons that someone has already started on.  and we stack our groups.  2<br/>
caster groups, 2 tank groups.  the bards are always with the tanks, the<br/>
caster groups don&#39;t need a bard.  they hang back, run in and cast, and hang<br/>
back some more.  the bard/tank/cleric groups are under the dragon the whole<br/>
fight, and need the resists more.  what we are talking about here is not how<br/>
to beat a dragon.  it&#39;s how to beat a dragon with the least number of<br/>
people, the least number of deaths, the least number of attempts, and the<br/>
quickest.  24 people, no lag, little to no deaths, clear from the beginning<br/>
guards to dragon&#39;s death in 60 or so minutes.  or you can take twice the<br/>
number of people with no enhanced resistances, have tons of lag and<br/>
linkdeaths, have several failed attempts, possibly no successful attempts,<br/>
and take 6 hours or more on attempts and CRs.  this is what happens when the<br/>
two dragons pop on our server.  our guild doing one dragon, another guild<br/>
doing the second, and what happens at each.  Free your mind, Harm.  We can<br/>
only show you the door, you must walk through it.<br/>
