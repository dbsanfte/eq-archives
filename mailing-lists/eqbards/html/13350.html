<div id="ygrps-yiv-300098833">I&#39;ve been fighting ogre bouncers (always red to me) a lot recently.  I have<br/>
given up on trying to get any of my higher level songs to stick on them.<br/>
Guards have increased magic resistance so songs like largos, DDD, pixie,<br/>
lullaby etc. almost always got resisted.  However, Bellow and CoD almost<br/>
always succeed. At 32d level, I would say my success at getting CoD to stick<br/>
against bouncers (even with their high MR) was at least 75% and probably<br/>
higher.  As a result, I have been twisting Anthem, Psalm of Warmth, and CoD<br/>
during the fight and then Bellow when the bouncer starts to run.  The<br/>
bouncers never fully resisted Bellow the entire night. Sometimes it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
do full damage but it still got through.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, camping ogre bouncers and other guards is not as financially<br/>
lucrative anymore with the recent patch.  Prior to the patch, bouncers<br/>
always dropped a regular steel weapon which you could sell for 11PP to a<br/>
merchant.  Now they are gonna start dropping fine steel weapons.  At least I<br/>
made around 100PP last night in Ogguk before the patch.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; group.  It actually seemed that just continous Discord was our best<br/>
&gt; &gt; bet.  (Bellow was almost always resissted by DW crocs).  In any case it<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that&#39;s interesting.  Bellow has a reputation for sticking<br/>
&gt; on red mobs, so I find it unusual that you were getting<br/>
&gt; resisted with Bellow, but getting Discord to stick.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; they work against different resists?<br/>
