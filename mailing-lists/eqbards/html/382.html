I have a few questions regarding the game in general...as well as a<br/>
few bard related questions.<br/>
<br/>
My first question is:  How do I modify a social? (such as making a<br/>
hotkey to say &#39;Hail and well met friends I am such and such the<br/>
Bard&#39;, or a bow button...or a /loc...or a /who...etc...etc...)<br/>
<br/>
	Click on the SOCIAL button and right-click anyone you want to modify.<br/>
Clicking on any of the parts in the center window allows you to change them.<br/>
<br/>
Is the snake fang worth using?  I have a very high skill in one<br/>
handed slashing and am getting tired of it, thinking of changing but<br/>
really dont know what skill to get.  (im 10th level btw)<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;ve heard some of the better bard only weapons are piercers so the snake<br/>
fang would be good to practice with. You are actually close to being able to<br/>
earn enough to get a combine piercer, but the snake fangs are MUCH cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a URL for some EQ maps?...yes the vault and stratics<br/>
have a few...but im looking to put together a book of maps for a<br/>
buddy of mine, and need a few more maps (such as the troll newbie<br/>
area, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
What level do you get Boistrous Bellow at?  And exactally how much<br/>
damage does it to per &#39;tick&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
	Don&#39;t know about &#39;boistrous&#39; but Boastful bellow is attained at level 12.<br/>
It does (level/2)+1 points max (rounding down).<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed if I go to any bard guild hall, they seem to sell me<br/>
items cheaper than any other shops...plus they buy for a few more<br/>
silver than the other places.  Is there a spell out there which will<br/>
make the shopkeepers (regular ones) buy and sell cheaper?  I assume<br/>
there is being we are the most charasmatic bunch on Norrath ;)<br/>
<br/>
	Guilds have faction amongst races. Being a bard, the bard guild is going to<br/>
like you the best since you&#39;re a member. So far the song I know for either<br/>
improving charisma or faction (don&#39;t know since it seems to be not working<br/>
now) is Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carrilion at level 11.<br/>
<br/>
Ok one last question to all you fantasy loving freaks out there<br/>
(sorry couldnt think of another question at this time...)<br/>
