<br/>
Got invited to a wedding the other night - Dunnik himself oversaw the<br/>
ceremony (lead GM on Veeshan).<br/>
<br/>
Went to the party afterwards - decided - what the heck - I got some plat to<br/>
burn, got mine up to ummm....78.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the fact that drinking in Kelethin can be extremely hazardous to<br/>
your health - and your screen gets really, really weird looking - I guess I<br/>
am missing the purpose of this skill.<br/>
<br/>
As a bard - I figure someday I may hangout in taverns - don&#39;t see any<br/>
problem with having this skill - but I&#39;m wondering exactly what it&#39;s<br/>
SUPPOSED to be useful for.<br/>
<br/>
My Int. went into the basement - some of the other stats rose nicely - but<br/>
I can&#39;t see them being terribly useful if you&#39;re swaying back and forth -<br/>
and can&#39;t see anything to hit it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if it gets high enough, you get the increased stats without the<br/>
side effects - but still - is this just something that the dev team got a<br/>
chuckle out of - or is it useful to build?<br/>
<br/>
We got any harddrinking bards here?</div>
