&gt; What are the chances of a bard less than 30th level successfully Lamenting a<br/>
&gt; 30+ mob? I would guess not very high.  Looks like the quest components<br/>
&gt; located in Solusek A as well as the carapace in Lower Guk will be the tough<br/>
&gt; ones to get for us younger bards.<br/>

<br/>
level 31 exceptionally good looking, talented and modest bard (me)<br/>
level 31 druid<br/>
level 31 magician<br/>
level 32 warrior (albeit a very very twinked level 32 warrior)<br/>
<br/>
We had little trouble at all clearing the whole king&#39;s area and camping &quot;The Pit&quot; where the mages<br/>
spawn, until the very end of the night when 2 goblins spawned when we were fighting 4 others.<br/>
There&#39;s only so much I can put to sleep :)  It was a great area for exp as well.<br/>
