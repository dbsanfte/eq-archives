<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047937507">At one time it was supposed to break Root, and did always and at all times.<br/>
In their infinite wisdom, yeah right, Verant decided that it was too<br/>
powerful to allow bards to break Root, SoW did at one time also by the way,<br/>
so they changed it.<br/>
Furthermore if its an exploit, then they should ban the monster not the<br/>
bard.  If I am playing Accelerando when I get Rooted there is currently no<br/>
way to prevent it breaking the Root.  I f I leave it on, the first pulse<br/>
breaks it.  If I stop the song immediately, the &quot;You slow down&quot; message<br/>
breaks it.  Perhaps Verant decided that having an already up and running<br/>
Accelerando break Root was not unbalanced, as it would no longer be a get<br/>
out of jail free like it used to be.  The only time this feature would help<br/>
you ws if you were already running away when you were Rooted, or you were<br/>
Rooted by a hidden caster while you were running.  Heck, physical damage now<br/>
has a chance to break Root, you gonna suggest that&#39;s an exploit and anyone<br/>
who&#39;s Root is broken by getting smacked or blasted should just stand there<br/>
and take it despite becoming unRooted?<br/>

This IS a bug. Its so obvious accelerando wasnt mean to break root and ghoul<br/>
root. Moving around while<br/>
there&#39;s still the root icon on your screen? Being rooted after you zone?<br/>
This is a bug and always has<br/>
been, and using it to break root is exploiting (not that it really matters<br/>
to Verant). But I wish bards<br/>
would quit treating this as a nifty feature and acknowledge it as a bug. So<br/>
technically the song is not<br/>
&quot;un-broken&quot; as you say.<br/>

&gt; On a happier note I did some testing of Accelerando last nite vs. Root.<br/>
&gt; This was prompted because prior to the patch I had made the following<br/>
&gt; observation accidentally in Kithicor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was running across the zone when a skeleton of some description rooted<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Accelerando was up and running and of course I stuck in place.  Since the<br/>
&gt; Mob wasn&#39;t advancing I quickly switched to twisting the two MR songs I had<br/>
&gt; memmed to hopefully resist some spells until Root wore of.  Two pulses<br/>
 </span></blockquote>later<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when I got the &quot;you slow down&quot; message from Accelerando running out I was<br/>
&gt; free!  Even though I had the Root icon clearly on the screen I was able to<br/>
&gt; run to the zone.  Immediately on the other side of the zone I was Rooted<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; several minutes.  I tested this again before yesterday&#39;s patch and the<br/>
&gt; pattern held, Accelerando, if it was on when the Root stuck, would break<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Root when it wore off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After the patch this has again changed.  Last nite I tested some more to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>see<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what other change had been made.  If you are Rooted and Accelerando is not<br/>
&gt; up, it will not break it.  If Accelerando is running when you get Rooted<br/>
&gt; however, the very first &quot;Your feet move faster&quot; pulse message will break<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; free.  This happened every time I tried it, both with Root and Ghoul Root.<br/>
&gt; The icon remained on the screen and moving to a new zone caused the Root<br/>
&gt; icon to again take hold.<br/>
&gt; For now, as long as Accelerando is running when you get Rooted, relax.  At<br/>
&gt; the next pulse you should (to use Verant&#39;s wording despite my actual real<br/>
&gt; testing) be able to move freely.  If Accelerando goes down though you will<br/>
&gt; not be able to restart it.  If you zone with that Root icon still on your<br/>
&gt; screen, expect to be Rooted on the other side.<br/>
