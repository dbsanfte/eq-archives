&gt; That&#39;s not quite accurate.  Glares Threateningly is KoS, but usually a flute<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Threatening will not attack unless they see you fighting or if<br/>
you stand next to them for long enough.  I&#39;ve been doing the<br/>
Lynuga ruby quest lately.  Lynuga is a troll and views me<br/>
threateningly.  If I just run up to her, she will almost<br/>
instantly attack me.  After I hit her with Carillon, she<br/>
still /conned threateningly, but I had enough time to hail her<br/>
and try various sneak/hide tricks in front of her before she<br/>
attacked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm, haven&#39;t tried it without the gloves, and I always thought<br/>
wielding an instrument deprived us of dual wield (i.e. you<br/>
only punch with your primary hand).  If we&#39;re bashing things<br/>
with our instruments though, I&#39;d like to see an animation for<br/>
it.  &quot;a bard BONKS you on the head with a lute for 7 points<br/>
