I just equipped my mandolin and twisted Bellow and Heal.  The wisp<br/>
was consistently hitting for ones (with the occasional nasty 10 <br/>
in there), but I was healing about 7 per tick, so the drop in health<br/>
was VERY slow.  Having said that, so was the drop in the health of<br/>
the wisp!<br/>
Getting adventurous, I tried twisting Bellow and Chords (again, with<br/>
mandolin) and the battle was MUCH faster.  And even the second wisp<br/>
that was attracted by Chords about half way through the first wisp<br/>
was not enough to turn the tide of battle.<br/>
In fact, once the second joined in I twisted Heal and Chords, and<br/>
hoped nothing would walk by.<br/>

I&#39;m just a thrill-seeker!<br/>
