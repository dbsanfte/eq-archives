<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122677552">Sometimes its just not that easy.  If you are pulling casters you don&#39;t have<br/>
the luxury of hanging around since their [any mob&#39;s] rules for casting don&#39;t<br/>
follow normal PC rules (range at start of cast, los, range at end of cast,<br/>
etc).  Secondly, in most situations the puller&#39;s job is already dangerous<br/>
(or tedious - pulling is work in as much as twisting is work for us bards).<br/>
Of the good pulling classes (rangers, monks come to mind initially you could<br/>
argue for SK&#39;s with feign or a cleric with DA to break a really nasty<br/>
spawn), none have the ability to deliver a high damage strike.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now on to a little tid bit that might make it a little easier for some<br/>
people to get their helms:  The paladin quest mob the netmaster (ugly little<br/>
goblin) spawns in LR and walks around the lake.  His placeholder is often an<br/>
aqua gob shaman, but occasionally is a warrior dw gob.  I don&#39;t know the<br/>
spawn point of these guys, but I do know they all &quot;collect&quot; in the cove in<br/>
LR went walking around.  The geometry of the zone is kinda funky back there<br/>
and you have a thin strip of land that is actually in the zone, but the art<br/>
looks like it extends back maybe 20-30 more feet before a cliff face is met.<br/>
Anyhow, they come walking up and around the shore line and will always enter<br/>
this cove.  Spawn time is long, maybe 2 hours or so but if you&#39;re hunting in<br/>
SK or doing giants in RM its probably worth your time to check every so<br/>
often.<br/>

&gt;Simply a perfect case of the puller not pissing off the mob enough.  You<br/>
&gt;puller needed to do more damage to keep the mobs attention. </span></blockquote></div>
