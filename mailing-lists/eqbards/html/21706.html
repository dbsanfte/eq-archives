<div id="ygrps-yiv-87320655">Just saw this on the Bug Board. So the question now is what is the other<br/>
coin collection quest he is referring to.<br/>

Ok, Fabian has been put on that League of Antonican Bard Faction. <br/>
Receiving the coin is random, its not 100% thing. I did the quest 10 times<br/>
and got the coin 3 times. <br/>
The coin I believe is for another coin collection quest, I think. <br/>
