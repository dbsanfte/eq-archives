<br/>
Tip #1 - be polite but persistent in contacting the head GM of your server.<br/>
It make take some time and some persistence and lots of politeness - and<br/>
role play helps too.  Persist.<br/>
<br/>
Tip#2 - move to kedge.  Try for a drum off carolyn kelpmaiden - as good or<br/>
close to Selos.<br/>
<br/>
Tip#3 - go to Naggy with guilds that need bards.  At 42, you should be<br/>
pretty respectable in your ability to regen mana and provide excellent<br/>
resists - stack Elemental & Guardian with a drum &lt;snif snif&gt; equipped and<br/>
have them look at their stats.  Promise not to melee and to do your best to<br/>
keep their clerics from getting feared and ae&#39;d.<br/>
<br/>
Tip#4 - camp MM and try for another drum.<br/>
<br/>
I dropped mine one time and died on the spot (looking for it as a couple<br/>
clops beat on me) so that I would have the loc and be able to have my party<br/>
find it.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Mistmoor Drum Goes Poof<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The last month has been a blast singing Chant of Flame and Fufils<br/>
&gt; with my Mistmoor Drum... I was dropping Blues fast, mixing in a<br/>
&gt; fear chain every so often... Then, yesterday I was switching from my<br/>
&gt; lute, had the pointer over it and the Drum went &quot;Poof&quot; !!!<br/>
&gt;   I backed up and searched the ground in a panic. Nothing there !!! I<br/>
&gt; petitioned and when the guide finally showed up her attitude<br/>
&gt; initially was &quot;Tough Toenails&quot;.. I finally talked her into reporting<br/>
&gt; it to Verant as a possible Bug and if they review my log I MAY or may<br/>
&gt; not get a replacement. Moonflower is Disconsolate.. I love that drum.<br/>
&gt;  Now the question is... at level 42, what are the chances of getting<br/>
&gt; a Drum of Selos March as a replacement ?  ..rare drop off Nagafen ?<br/>
&gt; Any tips ?<br/>
&gt;       I appreciate any advice you guys can give me,<br/>
&gt;       Moonflower Bllue, 42 Bard<br/>
