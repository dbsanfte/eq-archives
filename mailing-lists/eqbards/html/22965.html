<b>Subject:</b> How much more group xp should there be? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445973943">So, how much do we need the group xp modifier to be raised to make it have<br/>
an impact?  Some friends at work today were speculating and I couldn&#39;t<br/>
follow their math so decided to do my own.  I know there are some pretty<br/>
good math liking folks on this list, so just please use my calculations(and<br/>
assumptions) as a starting point, not a knife point(hehe).  I have enjoyed<br/>
the binding and other posts today.  I hope this one has some good responses,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Here I go:<br/>
<br/>
Soloer gets 1 kill and gets 100% xp<br/>
<br/>
Assuming no xp bonus and no class xp differences to make the math easier - 6<br/>
person group gets 6 kills and each person gets same xp as soloer gets<br/>
killing one.   With an enchanter pulling, mezzing and setting up next mob,<br/>
you might keep up, but not the norm, but for this argument, assume it is<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Math:  6(100%)/6 = 100%<br/>
<br/>
Now with 2% xp bonus per person(more than one) per kill - 6 person group<br/>
gets x kills<br/>
<br/>
Math:  6(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 110% if 6 mobs killed<br/>
       5(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 91% if 5 mobs killed<br/>
       4(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 73% if 4 mobs killed<br/>
<br/>
No wonder those that can solo, do solo, to get levels.<br/>
<br/>
Now assume 10% xp bonus per person per kill - 6 person group gets 6 kills<br/>
<br/>
Math:  6(100+(5*10))/6 = 150% if 6 mobs killed<br/>
       5(100+(5*10))/6 = 125% if 5 mobs killed<br/>
       4 - 100% if 4 mobs killed<br/>
<br/>
So, if you do have that good group, you can get same xp(or more if really<br/>
good group) and have fun with friends, acquaintances or whoever socializing<br/>
at the same time.  And for those that have to group, it just makes it<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
We can only hope.<br/>
<br/>
Piemur<br/>
<br/>
PS - I can&#39;t help it - I am optimistic. But if they really want to reward<br/>
grouping and entice those that solo to group more often, then they need to<br/>
make it comparable to soloing.</div>
