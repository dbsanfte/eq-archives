weopons, plus a ring (Dex +2 I think) plus *something* else, but I honestly<br/>
can&#39;t remember what.  I divied the loot up between three of my characters.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not too concerned if I couldn&#39;t have gotten more out of it.  For one<br/>
thing, I&#39;ve never been offered more than 7 pp for those HQ bear skins.  For<br/>
another thing, FS weopons cost a lot more than I can afford from vendors,<br/>
and I had killed enough bears that I didn&#39;t mind trading one of the skins<br/>
away.  I still have more.<br/>

wonder I couldn&#39;t find her!<br/>
