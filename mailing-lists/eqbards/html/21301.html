&gt; &gt;Assuming they get future additional funding, when is Horizons scheduled for<br/>
&gt; &gt;release?  Based on what I read, if they don&#39;t get the funding the project<br/>
&gt; &gt;will fall through, which will be a shame based on the promise of this game.<br/>

&gt; The funding issue is solved.  They plan to go to Beta early 2001.  They are<br/>
&gt; currently planning on a 1 year Beta with 4 phases.  From what Doug and David<br/>
&gt; have relayed recently they received more funding offers than they felt<br/>
&gt; comfortable accepting.  My only fear is that they are planning on so much<br/>
&gt; content that it may become a daunting task to avoid scope creep.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t Horizons another one of those games where the developers think<br/>
that in spite of UO having nothing but problems with PKs and grief<br/>
players, and EQ showing the overwhelming majority prefer a PvP<br/>
switch, that they can come up with the perfect, abuse free forced PvP<br/>
environment?<br/>
