<br/><br/>

<br/>
While a Pixie Struck/Mesmerized mob will wake up if you attack<br/>
it with melee or spells, it will not wake up if you debuff it.<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re fighting a mob that&#39;s buffed (Rune, damage<br/>
shield, etc), hit it with Pixie Strike, and let a spellcaster<br/>
hit it a few times with cancel magic.  It will not wake up.<br/>
You can also hit it with Chain or Binding, though I&#39;m not sure<br/>
what good that&#39;ll do.  One of the annoying things about<br/>
charming casters is that they buff themselves.  This is a<br/>
great way to debuff them when it&#39;s finally their turn to die.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the same could also apply to Lullaby, though I<br/>
didn&#39;t test that.<br/>
