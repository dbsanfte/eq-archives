<div id="ygrps-yiv-15397636">Yeah, I was in a slump for a while.  Lack of desire, and lack of a guild<br/>
that fit my personality.  But, I found a new guild, and I tell you, it&#39;s<br/>
amazing the things that happen when you find the *right* guild.  :)  As long<br/>
as I keep this rate up, I should be 60 in about 2 months, at the outside.  I<br/>
never ever thought I&#39;d make 60.  Heck, if I hadn&#39;t found this guild, I would<br/>
have quit by now, EQ was sooooo boring!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m having a blast.  Been going to HoT, got some Skyshrine armor, saw<br/>
some zones I&#39;d given up on ever seeing, but best of all, I&#39;ve made a bunch<br/>
of new friends, and I&#39;m finally *playing* EQ.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The xp gain in the new planes is...amazing.  I went to PoDisease last night,<br/>
and didn&#39;t have a lot of time, but wanted to solo something, just to see<br/>
what kind of xp it really was.  So, I found me a corner, and selected the<br/>
unlucky swamp rat.  It was a bit of a long kite, but not the worst I&#39;ve done<br/>
on a blue con, and I got nearly 2% of xp.  NEARLY 2% OF XP IN ONE KILL!!<br/>
I&#39;m still drooling at the fact that this means, even if I solo, which I<br/>
wont&#39; have to do often, I will soon be leveling again, just like the days of<br/>
LOIO.  :)<br/>
<br/>
So, if you&#39;ve quit EQ, or taking a break, and the rate of XP was an issue,<br/>
you might wanna check this out.  If Atonal, born in Nov 1999, can make level<br/>
60, then nearly anyone can.  :)<br/>
