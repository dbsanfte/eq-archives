<b>Subject:</b> Why bards DON&#39;T stink <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548212811">Ok, we have all seen the posts about how much people do not want bards in<br/>
a high level party. It seems to me that this is more of a personal<br/>
preference because let&#39;s face it, you can make a good party with ANY<br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
A real life buddy of mine came over last night.  We are both pretty into<br/>
EQ, he having a 20th magician and a new 8th druid.  He quit playing the<br/>
magician because he felt that magicians were POOR at higher levels.  We<br/>
have long had an argument about this.  In the beta, and for 3 weeks of<br/>
commercial I played a wizard while he played the magician.  HE COULD DO<br/>
ALL I COULD DO AND MUCH MORE.  For the first 10-15 levels or so, a wizard<br/>
is basically just a magician with no pet, summon<br/>
food/water/bandages/blade, and who does SLIGHTLY more damage with nukes.<br/>
Tell me which is better: hitting a mob for 16 a pop with a spell or<br/>
hitting for 14 a pop and having a pet whack for 10 or so every round too.<br/>
Come on.  I quit the wizard fast, as I felt he was too weak compared to<br/>
the magician.<br/>
<br/>
However, he says this: the pet and all that is now USELESS.  What he<br/>
really wants is the travel spells and all the other cool stuff wizards get<br/>
past 20th.  So you might say that magicians are more powerful early, but<br/>
wizards really shine later on.<br/>
<br/>
I say the same thing about bards.  A bard is an EXCELLENT class for the<br/>
first 10 levels.  A decent tank who can do so much on the side.  Every<br/>
party below 10th wants a bard, guaranteed.  Now, look at say paladins,<br/>
shadow knights, and rangers.  Basically MUCH weaker versions of a warrior<br/>
until they hit the magic 9th level and get spells.  They too are just<br/>
biding their time until they hit their &quot;sweet spot&quot; and get all the<br/>
spells.  Now at 20th level, which is better: a warrior, or a ranger, who<br/>
can do most of the warrior stuff and also heal, buff, track, etc.<br/>
<br/>
See what I mean?  It&#39;s like every class is good at either lower levels or<br/>
higher levels.  Here&#39;s a rough classification:<br/>
<br/>
AWESOME at lower levels:<br/>
<br/>
Warriors, magicians, bards.<br/>
<br/>
SO-SO at lower levels:<br/>
<br/>
Shadow knights, paladins, rangers, clerics.<br/>
<br/>
POOR at lower levels:<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters, wizards.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It almost flip-flops at the top end.  Probably the single most valuable<br/>
party member at levels 30+ would be a cleric.  Complete healing and<br/>
raising the dead (or spells like them) are unique and incredibly powerful.<br/>
Big beefy tank almost dead?  Complete heal him and he is JUST AS GOOD AS<br/>
NEW.  Wizards can nuke like mad and &#39;port out of trouble.  Enchanters<br/>
(once they fix the spells that is) get charms and other things that can<br/>
totally turn the tide of battle.<br/>
<br/>
Which is better?  A warrior, who has to heal for 10+ minutes after a<br/>
battle, or a ranger, who can track, heal, and has most of the combat<br/>
abilities as well.  I know which one I would want.<br/>
<br/>
Classes like enchanters and wizards are rewarded for their initially tough<br/>
experiences by sheer power later on.  Classes like warriors who RULE<br/>
early, on the other hand, pay for it later.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s face it, bards are best at low level.  I was talking to a higher<br/>
level bard, Uulas, 22nd level, and he said he NEVER uses any songs from<br/>
13th level - 18th level.  Good old Anthem de Arms and Hymn of Restoration<br/>
with a bit of the Bellow are it, pretty much.  Don&#39;t just ignore his<br/>
advice, either, he is widely regarded as one of the best bards and an<br/>
excellent party member on this server.  I have heard it said that &quot;Uulas<br/>
could make any group good.&quot;  Looking over the bard song list, only the<br/>
invisibility, flight, and mana regeneration spells look that much<br/>
different from what we already have.<br/>
<br/>
So, to all of us who are hoping to hit the higher levels someday: don&#39;t be<br/>
down about it, but bards don&#39;t make a good &quot;core&quot; party member.  We just<br/>
make any party MUCH BETTER.  Last night I hooked up with a cleric, a<br/>
wizard, and a rogue.  Almost the perfect group, right?  Tank, nuke, and<br/>
heals.  With me in there, the efficiency skyrocketed.  We fought a solid 2<br/>
hours with perhaps 10 minutes of down time.  We were taking little to no<br/>
damage, mowing through the beetles and lesser undead in Unrest like a<br/>
Catholic priest who was also the Orkin man. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s my main point.  Not a CORE member, but one heck of an<br/>
accessory.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the length and welcome any comments.<br/>
