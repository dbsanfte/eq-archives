<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112422253">For the past few weeks I have been reading post after post after post about<br/>
bards, and I have come to realize that I am very unhappy with the EQ bard.<br/>
And, its mostly because of the songs. I TOTALLY agree with anyone who has<br/>
said that the songs are just not what they could be. I understand that its<br/>
not an east thing to do to create some kick ass songs, but I am very upset<br/>
with Verant on this part. I am currently a 15th level Bard, and that is a<br/>
pretty good level for most classes. We should have a total of 15 songs at<br/>
this time to use, which is a pretty good selection, but like everyone else,<br/>
I find myself just using 4 or 5 songs all the time, because they are the<br/>
only usefull ones. Any other magic class usually has a variety of usefull<br/>
spells, and I rarely see 1 (Lets say wizrd) using the same 4 or 5 spell over<br/>
and over again. They switch them around considering what the situation calls<br/>
for<br/>
I know we get some kick ass songs later on in levels, but should I bust my<br/>
hump just to get to say, 32nd level so I can be a mana bard?<br/>
I know theres some more songs in there, but say at 32 level, the most songs<br/>
I can see being usefull are maybe 10. Which still leaves another useless 20<br/>
songs....I dont know...I think I am just gonna take a break and see where<br/>
they go with the bard, but for now, Rolande is on a vaction on Marr Island,<br/>
with all the &quot;Sisters of Love&quot; = )</div>
