<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945323670">Not sure if you are responding to my original - or a subsequent..  But you<br/>
are COMPLETELY wrong about GM&#39;s and Guides only helping due to a &quot;verifiable<br/>
bug&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t complain that they didn&#39;t help me - but that they help everyone<br/>
else in that situation.  In the past 24 hours I&#39;ve grouped with three count<br/>
em three people (counting my initial friend) who got their corpses moved by<br/>
GM&#39;s because they couldn&#39;t target them.  They spent maybe 40-60 minutes at<br/>
corpse retrieval when I spent literally 5-6 hours.  I guess in hindsight I<br/>
could have lied and said I couldn&#39;t target the corpse and see if they knew<br/>
enough about bards to tell me to sing the song.  These other people<br/>
certainly could have been forced to go to Freeport and buy a chipped bone<br/>
staff and done a corpse locate that way and targeted - but that didn&#39;t occur<br/>
to the GM&#39;s either.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the GM&#39;s spent any time even verifying these peoples<br/>
complaints.  They just popped in and move the Corpse right next to the zone<br/>
entrance.<br/>
<br/>
More to the point - my  problem wasn&#39;t getting to the corpse - but getting<br/>
the corpse out of lava.  I think it&#39;s a stupid level design.  Especially<br/>
given that things have been so laggy lately it makes it quite easy to<br/>
misstep.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;m complaining about...<br/>

&gt; Why is it that people seem to have it in thier head that GM&#39;s and Guides<br/>
must help you if you cannot get<br/>
&gt; your corpse?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The ONLY reason they assist in corpse retreival is if it is stuck in a<br/>
wall. Or fallen through the world.<br/>
&gt; Or lost due to a verifiable bug.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you fall in lava. It is YOUR responsibility to get it back. (Hope you<br/>
made friends)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To say that GM&#39;s are worthless cause they told you &quot;tough sh*t&quot; is lke<br/>
saying &quot;Dang. I cut my toe off with<br/>
&gt; this knife. Perhaps I should sue the hospital cause they can&#39;t put it back<br/>
on.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you plan to play around dragons, lava, gods. You SHOULD expect trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have died underneath Nagafen, but have still gotten my corpse. I have<br/>
had guildmates lose thier corpses<br/>
&gt; on the other side of Fear. I have had guildmates lose corpses &quot;I forgot<br/>
where&quot; in Sol B. But they have all<br/>
&gt; been retrieved. No GM was even called because they all were of our own<br/>
doing. (Lag related or not).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What you need is a group of people that you can trust to assist you when<br/>
the chips are down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps it is just me, but, if you lose your corpse in lava, don&#39;t go<br/>
crying about the GM&#39;s not running to<br/>
&gt; your aid. They are not supposed to help you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Take responsibility of your own problems. If the problem is indeed a bug,<br/>
then by all means call a GM.<br/>
