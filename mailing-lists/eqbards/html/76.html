<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039330764">I agree - Bards do NOT have to be the bringers of sweetness and light to<br/>
the world.  The idea that Bards should provide their services for free<br/>
goes against my thoughts on why we are ALL trying to play Bards...we are<br/>
each free to do as we please!  Some might want to charge an arm and leg<br/>
for their services (and sometimes that is a cheap price if a corpse is<br/>
in deadly territory!), some might wish to gain a reputation for being a<br/>
&quot;nice&quot; guy or gal and do it for free.  Nothing should be set in stone...<br/>
<br/>
In point of fact I charge higher level folks more than I do lower levels<br/>
- they have the means, they should know what they are getting into<br/>
better, and if they really need a guide to their corpse I am willing to<br/>
oblige...for a price.  This doesn&#39;t make me greedy, if anything I think<br/>
higher level folk respect me more!  You put forward that we do this<br/>
service for free, then all we are is another aspect of the game to be<br/>
used...like NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my plat and a half on the subject.  I too am on Cazic-Thule, seen<br/>
you around Pistov!  We should travel together sometime!<br/>
