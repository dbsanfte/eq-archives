A whole lot of greenies will go agro on you. The king room solo isn&#39;t an<br/>
option since Borxx (named evil eye) is level 32, few HP but he hits for 70s.<br/>
The knight room is possible if most of them don&#39;t agro based on level. With<br/>
the exception of Borxx nothing in there should present a problem solo but<br/>
it&#39;s getting swarmed that&#39;s a problem. I do recall my ranger (on corpse<br/>
recovery run) was able to get just outside the king room at 29th level and<br/>
not agro those goblins outside. The Elites and king would have gone agro for<br/>
sure though.<br/>
