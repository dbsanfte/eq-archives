Will brass go up without the song &quot;going off&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I figured that the song effect had to &quot;go off&quot; for you to be able to skill<br/>
in it.<br/>
<br/>
If it needs to go off, park yourself in a safe spot next to another PC that<br/>
is not in your group (I&#39;m going to use my second account for that).  The<br/>
song will &quot;go off&quot; but it will not affect another PC (unless of course you<br/>
are on a PvP server)<br/>
<br/>
If not, well, shame on me.  I&#39;ll have to do that one night.<br/>
<br/>
I parked my bard in Qeynos and sang my invis song and went to bed.  The next<br/>
morning wind was maxed.  Gotta love being a bard.  8)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to train up my brass skill, doesn&#39;t seem to work without a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; target.  I&#39;ve been using Denon&#39;s area of effect in &#39;safe&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; places and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem to increase my skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have trained it in safe spots, it just goes up very very very slowly<br/>
