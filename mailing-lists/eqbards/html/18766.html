<div id="ygrps-yiv-245534245">CoF/TBB i say, not by much.  more AC with the CoF/TBB.  more HP with the<br/>
RBB/HBC.  the CoF has a bit more haste but item+song is max haste anyway.<br/>
it&#39;s a close call but i doubt i will have the opportunity for the CoF<br/>
anyway.  currently auctioning my sash to get money to buy an HBC.  any<br/>
current figures on sash and HBC prices?  i&#39;m hearing 15k for sash and 10k<br/>
for HBC, give or take.<br/>

&gt; I might have the opportunity to swap mine for a CoF soon.<br/>
&gt; What do you think is a better combo?  RBB/HBC or CoF/TBB?<br/>
