<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-931254703">thanks for the support all :)<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s clear to me now (as a few have posted here and elsewhere) that since<br/>
the humblest haste item maxes out our speed, melees who could get the full<br/>
speedup from the uber haste items should have priority.  so i&#39;m a firm<br/>
believer now that dragon/god haste items should go those without a haste<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
of course, we still need an fbss or swirlspine still.  sadly the guild still<br/>
thinks since we have a haste song, it&#39;s a waste to let the bards wear a<br/>
fbss/ssbelt.  (tho this may have changed.  there are only a couple bards<br/>
left in the guild at dragon/god level.  there used to be enough to put a<br/>
bard in every group.)  because of the guild rules this would only happen for<br/>
us if we joined pickup groups at frenzied, with no guildmates that could<br/>
*cough* use it.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s a moot point for me now anyway.  i left the guild.  i never really<br/>
thought it&#39;d happen.  these are my friends, not people to help me gather<br/>
loot.  leaving over this issue would&#39;ve been foolish.  but it was pretty<br/>
clear in the discussion that too many in the guild think we should make<br/>
useful chars instead and only dig out the bards at large targets, where<br/>
we&#39;re actually useful.  and what a god-awful burden it was getting us bards<br/>
up to dragon/god level to begin with, why don&#39;t we shut up.<br/>
<br/>
but they&#39;re still my friends, so i won&#39;t say the guild&#39;s name :P</div>
