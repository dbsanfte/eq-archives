<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562434054">Ah, your showing your age :)<br/>
<br/>
The two songs you discussed are better at higher<br/>
levels when your out fighting casters.  I was with a<br/>
group in runnyeye fighting the level 29 and 30 Evil<br/>
eyes down there, and had it not been for twisting<br/>
those two songs with a drum and cranking everyone<br/>
resist up to 100 or so we&#39;d have gotten killed.  Also<br/>
I use lullabye when soloing or dueling casters as it<br/>
interupts them.  It helps in crowd control, but be<br/>
careful in dungeons as it can turn out to be another<br/>
one of those <br/>
<br/>
*the entire floor hits you for XXX damage*<br/>
*You have been slain by every availabe mob*<br/>
<br/>
I love it when that happens.  Happy hunting<br/>
