&gt; It doesn&#39;t quite work like that.  You can charm it once, but you cannot<br/>
&gt; maintain the charm.  The only time you can charm it again is after the charm<br/>
&gt; has worn off, and by that time both monsters are beating on you, making it<br/>
&gt; difficult to regain your positioning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, good to know.  Still, it doesn&#39;t change the strategy of<br/>
hitting charm over and over on the off chance that the charm<br/>
will expire if you&#39;re trying to stop kill stealing.  The range<br/>
is pretty big (my new fetch song :-), so you can back off far<br/>
enough that when the charm expires, you can recharm before<br/>
either mob can reach you.  This is obviously not viable in<br/>
dungeons.<br/>

&gt; sustains while under your control doesn&#39;t count as damage you&#39;ve inflicted,<br/>
&gt; which adds a bit of strategy if you&#39;re concerned about getting both kills.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was wondering what happens if your pet does 99% of the<br/>
damage, then dies.  Do you get the kill, or the person who<br/>
delivers the final 1%?<br/>
