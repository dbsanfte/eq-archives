<div id="ygrps-yiv-412734113">I&#39;m new to this discussion, and obviously to the bard (havent even<br/>
picked my name yet, any suggestion?)<br/>
The button mash is one factor which made me decide to make a cleric a<br/>
while ago when i started him...  I think its silly...  The suggestion to<br/>
just make songs a little better, but un &quot;stackable&quot; makes a lot of<br/>
sense.  But it aint going to happen...<br/>
<br/>
As for marketing depts overriding the programmers, what better example<br/>
is there than the MERP (middle earth) online game.  The programmers were<br/>
trying to break new ground with that one, but th emarketing people<br/>
thought it wouldnt sell.  Permanent Death was the first &quot;feature&quot; to get<br/>
the axe...<br/>
