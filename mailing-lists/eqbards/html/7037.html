<b>Subject:</b> Re: Binding and other Enhancements <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-377140785">Well, having just played my first non-binding character up to a decent<br/>
level, I would have to say that I agree with adding NPC binding.  Obviously<br/>
cities only, and would also like to see casters more limited on bind points<br/>
as well for game balance.  I also agree death should have a penalty.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the reasons non-binders feel like they would like this has been<br/>
said already.  But I would like to point out another &quot;game balance&quot; issue<br/>
that is the same one Brad used when modifying kiting.  A person should be<br/>
able to choose a class based on its abilities and thier playing style and<br/>
not feel like they get a significant advantage in choosing another.<br/>
<br/>
I will state this.  Unless a friend or guildmate is on and capable of<br/>
binding my warrior, I won&#39;t play her.  Period.  I&#39;ll play my caster who can<br/>
bind nearby.  Since if I&#39;m not with my group two things will happen:<br/>
<br/>
a) As most non-binders are also front-line fighters, and in my case always<br/>
a main tank, I will be the first to go down in battle.  AND if I do my job<br/>
while going down will hopefully be the only casualty.  I will loose exp.  I<br/>
will have a long run, I may loose more exp on that run if unlucky.  I will<br/>
have no company on the run who can aid me (since if a caster did go down -<br/>
they won&#39;t reswpan near me).<br/>
<br/>
b) The rest of the party will be back in business and getting more exp, and<br/>
more loot while I run.  In addition, the evacuation-based spells the<br/>
casters have, usually *do* let them live (and as a warrior I hope I did buy<br/>
them time to fire them), so they may have gotten exp for the kill I died<br/>
in.  They usually will start fighting as soon as casters are at full mana,<br/>
but maybe just pull light blues until I get back.<br/>
<br/>
Then I get back, a half an hout later, and we go for the yellow/red pull,<br/>
and the cycle may just start over again.  Two bad pulls (no ones fault<br/>
really) and I could have used up my whole 2-3 hours of playing time and had<br/>
a significant loss of exp., and almost no loot.  In addition, a caster who<br/>
is bound nearby WILL NOT (unless they are a regular companion or an<br/>
incredibly self-sacrificing person) spend 40 minutes, walking back to the<br/>
nearest town to bind my warrior and then returning to the battle area.  Why<br/>
should they loose 40 mins of thier play time for me?  I can&#39;t fault them<br/>
for it.  And if I see the area is tough, perhaps fewer hunters causing<br/>
tougher pulls .. I camp that warrior FAST now.  I don&#39;t want to get too far<br/>
behind my more regular companions.  And again, I add not even because the<br/>
pick up group was bad ... just a hard zone, and no one wanting to &quot;waste&quot;<br/>
40 minutes to bind me closer.<br/>
<br/>
So, I consider binding to be like kiting.  There are many nights that it,<br/>
and it alone, dictates which character I will be playing.  And as well, it<br/>
also means (contrary to game design hopes)  I&#39;ll probably solo a caster as<br/>
opposed to tanking in a group.  So IMHO, without NPC binding, the binding<br/>
ability does provide a reason far outweighing my playing style or class<br/>
balance which will lead me to play a certiain class (or classes).<br/>
<br/>
I will add its worse for warriors than hybrids ... we have no spells ever,<br/>
no speed aids, no invis aids, and as primary tanks are even more likely to<br/>
go down on an escape.<br/>
