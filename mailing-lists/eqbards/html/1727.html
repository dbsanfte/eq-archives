<div id="ygrps-yiv-214798596">Just out of curiousity, does anyone else think the amount of mail on this<br/>
list is crazy? I didnt check my email for 2 days and I had like 100+ msg&#39;s,<br/>
and that seems the be the average for day to day. I aint complainin&#39;, just<br/>
think its a little silly.</div>
