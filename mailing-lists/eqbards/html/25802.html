the innovation and global economic benefits the US provides, there&#39;ll be<br/>
something /arguably/ wrong with Americans&#39; sense of self-importance.<br/>

Remember, without us there&#39;d be no Internet. <br/>

any other market.<br/>

&gt; get that number) - only looking at the American market when talking about<br/>
&gt; &quot;The Largest&quot; or &quot;Best&quot; is a failing that we&#39;d be better off if we expanded<br/>

coincidence that our income and standard of living are more than double<br/>
theirs.<br/>
