<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106729583">Heh - ya, I know.  I have reached that stage in EQ where you get kinda<br/>
&quot;bitter&quot; about some things.  I dont think I have it as bad as some others I<br/>
know - and I still keep playing.  But....(and these are my feelings - imho,<br/>
ymmv, yadda yadda)<br/>
<br/>
1. There is a strong &quot;Us vs Them&quot; atmosphere in EQ. Us being Verant and the<br/>
&quot;Vision(tm)&quot; and the &quot;You have been summoned by the Gods (who in r/l maybe a<br/>
some volunteer with little or no customer service exp/training and a short<br/>
fuse)&quot; and the Them being the players (who are probably lying, cheating,<br/>
coniving, theiving baistiages or else why would they be asking for a res /<br/>
item that got lost doing a quest / help finding a corpse / return of items<br/>
from rotted corpse when printed user manual has incorrect times for corpse<br/>
decay / etc etc.).<br/>
<br/>
2. Advancement in the game is based on &quot;time served&quot; 10 times more than<br/>
&quot;skilled play.&quot;  And this makes 80 to 90 percent of the game very boring.<br/>
Only new places offer some relief and granted the design of them has gotten<br/>
better - still after doing Seb Crypt 10 times - it gets boring.  Camping for<br/>
exp is flat out boring.  How many hows killing aviaks / pickclaws /<br/>
froogluks / kobolds / guards / etc. etc. can you stand?  This may be due to<br/>
fighting &quot;npc&#39;s&quot; rather than live ppl where each fight is dynamic. So, the<br/>
basis of the game maybe just boring because any AI in the NPC&#39;s is so<br/>
limited - and repetitive.<br/>
<br/>
3. The &quot;content&quot; based events/quests/lore & history has been skimpy at best.<br/>
Granted, it&#39;s very difficult to provide RolePlay Lore when there are so many<br/>
Duuuudz who wanna kill it and loot it.  But where is the incentive for<br/>
players to do otherwise? Where are the tools to facilitate GM events? And<br/>
they may not have the resources to make dynamic events actually work - ie<br/>
why bother if there is no money in it.<br/>
<br/>
So, any how - I had a great year in the game.  The part i love the best is<br/>
the other players.  I know there are a couple others who play the game to<br/>
&quot;live in the world&quot; (Silky? Peace? Sylly? oh that&#39;s me!) and there is fun<br/>
stuff there.  I have had as much fun taking &quot;newbies&quot; in Rivervale to the<br/>
Sheriff, levitating and running to the rocks so we can climb to the top of<br/>
the mountains - as I have had doing dragons and planes.  Maybe more fun.<br/>
<br/>
So, for the younger bards reading this, take your time and play the way you<br/>
like.  There is a lot of fun out there.  Only when you join the quest for<br/>
exp race and leet loots, remember to smell the roses too.  All you have to<br/>
do to get to level 50 is kill 1,210,314 moss snakes, skellies, aviaks,<br/>
pickclaws, froogs, kobolds, specs, etc, etc, etc.  It&#39;s a long haul but<br/>
eventually you get there.<br/>
