<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053557716">At level 20 I currently alternate between my dragoon dirk, barbed leather<br/>
whip, and enamelled black mace to keep all my skills up.  It seems to me<br/>
though that the whip is a big stamina drainer and I&#39;ll probably be looking<br/>
to replace it soon, it was a gift though, so I cannot complain too much.<br/>
I&#39;ll probably end up keeping the mace and the dirk for a long while as<br/>
they seem to do the job pretty well and a lot of the &#39;better&#39; stuff seems<br/>
to cost more than I&#39;ve gathered throughout my career.  The dirk I bought<br/>
for 40 if I recall correctly, the mace for 230 (though I have heard that<br/>
the mace can sometimes go for a lot more.)<br/>
Unless I&#39;m really focusing on raising my piercing, I just leave the dirk<br/>
in my off hand (as it&#39;s the fastest of the three and thus has the best<br/>
chance of being useful) and swap the mace and the whip in my primary.<br/>

&gt; Greetings all,<br/>
&gt; Hail and well met everyone ) I&#39;m a new member to this list and I play a<br/>
&gt; Bard of the 18th Song. I was wondering if anyone had any preferences as to<br/>
&gt; what weapons you Duel Wield. Currently I am using a PGT and Combine<br/>
&gt; Scimitar. The only other character I have is a Cleric so I really don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have much experience with melee weaps and though I expect I will be playing<br/>
&gt; instruments most of the time, I was wondering what you all use.  Any<br/>
&gt; suggestions? Thanks<br/>
