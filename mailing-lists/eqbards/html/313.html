<div id="ygrps-yiv-866714990">Both of the lists of song descriptions that I&#39;ve seen raved over this <br/>
spell.  One called it &quot;the feign death of the bard world.&quot;  I just don&#39;t <br/>
get it.  I have never found it to do anything except make just about every <br/>
monster in range mad at me, even when I tried it with a Mandolin and a <br/>
string skill of 100.<br/>
<br/>
We tested it at the aquagoblin camp in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, playing the song <br/>
to see if it would let me approach the camp without waking the goblins. <br/>
 Out of five tries (at 2 to 4 goblins apiece) I saw two messages of a <br/>
goblin&#39;s head nodding, and all five times all of the goblins immediately <br/>
swarmed me (including the one who nodded).<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, I tried it in Blackburrow on a batch of regular and scrawny <br/>
gnolls, all green to me.  (The remnants of a small train after the trainee <br/>
fled the zone.)  Again, they all attacked me.  I also tried it in the <br/>
newbie zone.  Result: one rat nodding and one rat attacking me.<br/>
<br/>
Is there something I&#39;m doing wrong, or are all the people who wrote good <br/>
things about the song basing their comments on a beta version that no <br/>
longer applies?<br/>
