<div id="ygrps-yiv-991463840">I had a lot of problems around that level too.  Didn&#39;t spend much time in<br/>
Unrest because the server was so crowded.  I would recommend places where<br/>
you can hunt REALLY close to a server boundary or near guards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m speaking of two places in particular where I had really good luck at 22:<br/>
Highkeep basement and Everfrost.  Highkeep you can camp the foot of the<br/>
stairs.  Run to the guards or even zone to Highpass (a good ways to go).<br/>
Highkeep is pretty crowded (on Xegony) so you may have probs getting in<br/>
groups - but will probably have someone to help if it gets hairy.<br/>
<br/>
Everfrost has some nasty trains.  The flag room is nice - but dangerous if<br/>
people deep in can&#39;t handle their rooms - the trains will go through the<br/>
flag room.  While you tend to be pretty safe in the alcove - its not<br/>
completely so - and most groups tend to get lazy and fight far enough out<br/>
they are exposed to the trains.<br/>
<br/>
The safest spot is right next to the zone.  You can have someone pull to<br/>
that area.  You are then literally right next to the zone.  There is no way<br/>
you will die unless you are being really risky...<br/>
<br/>
I know how frustrating it is.  I&#39;m only a few levels above you - but the key<br/>
is finding the right place and the right group.  At the end of 24 - I found<br/>
that with the right group (particularly including a 29 druid who could<br/>
succor us away in trouble) a full group with the right class/level mix we<br/>
could handle shadowmen with relative ease.  Made 25 and then tried it with<br/>
the wrong combo.  I literally lost 25 four times.  The last time falling to<br/>
a half-bubble below 25.  I was real frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I moved to Highkeep basement - got in with a good group (ad-hoc!) and got 25<br/>
plus over a bubble into the same day (last Sunday) that I last 25 for the<br/>
last time.  Monday night - I got in another ad-hoc group in the Aviak<br/>
Penthouse and got another bubble and a half.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line - if you find trouble in a particular area - try not to get too<br/>
frustrated - but equip your drum - fire up; Selo&#39;s - and try to find<br/>
somewhere else to hunt!<br/>

&gt; I hate to see a solid contributor leave, but if you must, you must.  22nd<br/>
&gt; was bad for me too.  I&#39;m having a blast at 28th.  I&#39;m not gaining any<br/>
levels<br/>
&gt; right now because I&#39;m accumulating my Lambent items, but the questing is<br/>
&gt; really fun to me.<br/>
