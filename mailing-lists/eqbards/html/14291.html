<div id="ygrps-yiv-682205476">OK after reading 5-6 posts from people all saying the same thing I get the<br/>
picture.  I still think that the 24 song for the most part is now useless.  <br/>
<br/>
1)  OK long range ultravision is nice but at 24th level and beyond how many<br/>
players with normal vision need it?  By then they have long had an alternate<br/>
light source (i.e. Lightstone) that they can use.  Granted it might help<br/>
while the party is running across a zone but since most playtime is spent<br/>
camping group members are generally close to one another and therefore don&#39;t<br/>
require long range vision.  Human bards are probably the only race that<br/>
might need that song but how many human bards are even out there?<br/>
<br/>
2)  Grouping with pet classes.  You have to consider the times when see<br/>
invisibility is used in a dungeon.  Most of the time its used in conjunction<br/>
with invis to get from the zone to wherever you want to camp (and vice<br/>
versa) and bypass all the mobs along the way.  If you need to invis to get<br/>
there, then pet classes shouldn&#39;t summon their pet until they get to where<br/>
they are camping. Bottom line is that for the most part invis and see invis<br/>
are used in conjuction with one another and therefore the pet is gonna die<br/>
anyway.  Only situations where I can see using see invis without invis is if<br/>
you know a mob buffs himself with invis or if you think another group is<br/>
invis and might KS from you.  If thats the case just have one of the casters<br/>
cast the see invis and free up one of your song slots.  <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that Clouding now performs the same primary function as the<br/>
level 24 song so IMO it would be nice if they gave us a new 24 song that we<br/>
could actually use on a regular occasion. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; That song grants Ultravision + see invis (L24), and still has value.<br/>
&gt; What if you are in a group with a shaman, necromancer, or mage but want<br/>
&gt; to sing party see invis? Are you going to kill their pets with your<br/>
&gt; invis song to do it? You get the picture. ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They did a nice job of giving our invis song a huge bonus which was<br/>
&gt; sorely needed, let&#39;s not complain about the fact that we now have 2<br/>
&gt; songs that grant us this highly desirable (in my opinion) ability.<br/>
