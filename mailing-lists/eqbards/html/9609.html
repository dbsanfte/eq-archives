<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078288351">Hello everyone.  Last night I had a disappointing fiasco in Solusek.  I<br/>
got together a good group and went in to get my two bard quest items.<br/>
We headed for the king room, and managed to break the spawn (thank you<br/>
Lament).  We camped the room for about 4 hours.  Almost everyone in the<br/>
group had some quest item they wanted, and I was the only bard.  Well,<br/>
to make a long story short, after killing at least 25 solusek champions,<br/>
5 sol mages, 6 sol shamans, 25ish inferno goblins.  Not a single one of<br/>
us got a quest item.  Are these supposed to be that rare?  Are we just<br/>
in the wrong place to find these items or what?  We got a couple<br/>
mediocre items off the king, but I didn&#39;t get any of them (lost the<br/>
roll).  To add insult to injury, just as I was saying I needed to go (I<br/>
had already stayed up 2 hours late), we had a bad pull, and half of us<br/>
died.  And I awoke to......Greater Feydark.  Heh... Oops.  Thank god for<br/>
revive.<br/>
<br/>
Any insight?  Did they nerf it with the latest patch or something?  Or<br/>
has it always been this rare for them to drop the quest items?<br/>
<br/>
Frustrated,<br/>
