&gt; Hiya all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I made level 40 yesterday and was wondering if anyone knew what would be a<br/>
&gt; good place to go, being a bard I don&#39;t have the luxury of being able to<br/>
&gt; solo dwarfs all day and make it out of hell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am really trying hard to level as fast as I can now because I have some<br/>
&gt; of the best equipment available to me but lack the level to go to the<br/>
&gt; planes with my guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any info on where to fight would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
