Offhand, I would say that at 12th level, your meditation skill<br/>
is only 60 (65?), so it will be &quot;failing&quot; at a pretty<br/>
substantial rate (whatever it is that failure does).  So I<br/>
would expect some variability in your mana regeneration times<br/>
regardless of whether or not the jig was playing.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the possibility the jig may be interacting<br/>
unintentionally with meditation failures, causing an increase<br/>
in regeneration rate.  e.g. if &quot;succeeding&quot; at meditation<br/>
means you gain, say, 5 points of mana, and the jig reduces the<br/>
time for a meditation pulse from 8 sec to 6 sec (though I<br/>
still think this is a client refresh illusion), then it would<br/>
increase the regeneration rate because the success/fail check<br/>
would be made more frequently.  That would decrease<br/>
regeneration times at early levels, but show no difference at<br/>
later levels.<br/>
