<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103619835"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;Someone mentioned the apparently bisexual and polygamous &quot;Eve&quot;, whose name<br/>
&gt; &gt;is dropped by the &quot;postmasters&quot; after a successful delivery. I&#39;ve found no<br/>
&gt; &gt;sign of Eve, but it sounds like she might be the key to the next step in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;quest. Whether that step exists yet is another matter.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Mannerism (on The Rathe)<br/>
&gt; No big secret there, Eve is one of the FedEx bards in Qeynos (at the guild).<br/>
&gt; Her husband Tarn (I think) is also a FedEx bard that stands right beside<br/>
&gt; her.<br/>

Tarn then whenever you drop off a letter.<br/>
