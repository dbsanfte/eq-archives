 </span></blockquote>It will work almost all the time against moss snakes (though<br/>
it&#39;s still annoying when an ultra-low level mob resists it<br/>
twice in a row).  It will never work against the IGs.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been helping out some lower level guildmembers lately (acting<br/>
as safety crowd controller) and had the chance to try the song<br/>
against the mobs I was fighting when I first got the song.  <br/>
I&#39;m pretty convinced now that the unreliability of this song<br/>
at higher levels is due to the second resist high level mobs<br/>
get.  I still think the chance of this second resist is way<br/>
too high, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of the song being<br/>
broken anymore.  (Funny, with GZ being a psychology major, I<br/>
thought he&#39;d have taken enough statistics to know that a 25%<br/>
chance of failure stacked with a 35% chance of failure makes<br/>
for a 51% chance of failure.)<br/>
