I think one of the main problems at the moment with our songs is<br/>
the fact that &#39;resistances&#39; are broken. (Or so I&#39;ve been lead to<br/>
believe).<br/>
So, what good is Elemental Rhythms and Purifying Rhythms if they<br/>
do nothing to help you combat spellcasters or undeads or the like?<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in an earlier post, my level 13 bard plays 3 songs<br/>
out of the 13 available: Anthem, Bellow and Heal.<br/>
The occasionally Accelerando or Locating Lyric not withstanding.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the higher level songs will add some variety, but from what<br/>
I have seen of spell listings, the most useful ones seem to just<br/>
be upgrades of lower level songs.<br/>
<br/>
Hence my bard is also on vacation.<br/>
