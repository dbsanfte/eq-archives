&gt; note on these songs. There can only be one explanation for missing as many<br/>
&gt; notes as I am, Verant botched the patch! I know it sounds hard to believe,<br/>
&gt; but its the only reason I am all of a sudden having this problem. Any other<br/>
&gt; explanation is crap. We only started having this problem when they patched<br/>
&gt; the the Missed Notes on high level songs last patch. We all need to /bug and<br/>
&gt; /petition this everynight to get it fixed, or get a real explanation of<br/>
&gt; whats going on.<br/>
<br/>
I think I mentioned this before, but let me do it again.  It is my<br/>
personal opinion that Verant may be nerfing casters silently.  This is<br/>
particularly noticable on your earlier songs/spells where you very rarely<br/>
fizzle. miss a not or are interrupted.  As of last night my level 17<br/>
magician on a full bar of mana in combat fizzle twice and was interrupted<br/>
five or six times while trying to cast shock of blades.  Please not that<br/>
Shock of Blades is a lvl 8 DD spell that I have been using since I got it.<br/>
My skill is maxed for my level.  So this may be a nerf for casters which I<br/>
think it might be,  I would not put it past Verant for nerfing something<br/>
without telling us at all.<br/>
