<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433342485">Multi-guild/unguilded raids suck.  Why?  Here&#39;s my reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Everyone has their own opinion on looting rights and feels like they have the perogative to voice<br/>
it.  Every non-guild Efreeti raid or dragon raid or planes or fire giant raid has resulted in arguments<br/>
over loot...<br/>
2)  No one feels obligated to stay.  If it takes an extra half hour or an hour to get the last needed<br/>
cleric, expect people to start leaving.  Loose that last enchanter or bard and the Vox raid gets<br/>
canceled...<br/>
3)  No one feels obligated to stick around for corpse recovery when things go bad.  Once they get their<br/>
own bodies they are gone.<br/>
4)  People get pissed if you don&#39;t spend enough time where their loot drops...  Kill too many Clerics of<br/>
Innoruk and get too much cleric armor and the shamans and tanks start leaving...<br/>
<br/>
The only successful raids I have been on (and yes, I&#39;ve been on ALOT of unsuccessful ones) have been<br/>
primarily a single guild sponsored events that invite a few of us from smaller guilds to fill in the weak<br/>
spots.<br/>

&gt; You need 3 things:  1 - A leader who is hard assed.  2 - An organizer and<br/>
&gt; 3 - a cop to keep track of folks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As long as everyone can understand their role and group leaders communicate<br/>
&gt; well, in the planes you can use OOC as a &#39;guildchat&#39; area so that all group<br/>
&gt; can communicate.  Use SHOUT for orders from the leaders and information from<br/>
&gt; the various group leaders (IE:  Cleric Linkdead etc)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can do planes with pickup groups you just need to use your head, keep<br/>
&gt; folks organized and make sure everyone keeps OOC and shout clear for event<br/>
&gt; use.  If they wanna chitchat they need to keep it in group/guildsay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt; No, but there&#39;s more to it than you might think.  You need to know how to<br/>
&gt; organize groups, buff people,<br/>
&gt; &gt; pull stuff, battle tactics, and loot rules.  It&#39;s probably impossible to<br/>
&gt; do this effectively if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; essentially doing &quot;pickup&quot; groups each time.  Buffing alone can take hours<br/>
&gt; if you don&#39;t have it organized<br/>
&gt; &gt; well up front.  Heck, just getting people into groups can take a couple of<br/>
&gt; hours if you don&#39;t know who you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have available and they aren&#39;t organized.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If two or three guilds consistently work together, or if one larger (but<br/>
&gt; not quite large enough) guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; fills in the holes by picking up extra players or another small guild, it<br/>
&gt; can work just fine, though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;     I know this isn&#39;t Bard Related -but no Kabong so far - so I have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; question - is it impossible to do a Dragon or Plane raid with members<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple guilds?<br/>
