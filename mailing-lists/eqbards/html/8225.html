<div id="ygrps-yiv-876520167">That&#39;s been an interesting topic among the developers here at work.  they<br/>
had a different take from everyone else on the proliferation of No Drop<br/>
items.  There is a group here who believe it is the enormous number of items<br/>
ever growing in the character databases that Verant is concerned about.  By<br/>
making them No Drop they were trying to keep the number of in game objects<br/>
down.  An interesting speculation and a reason why it took so long to get<br/>
the bank set up to accept No Drop items perhaps.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lightstone or not. (It used to be that you could run around <br/>
&gt; killing ONLY the wisps that gave off light, and would be<br/>
&gt; assured of a lightstone each time. Now you must kill em all<br/>
&gt; and taken your chances.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now if only someone could come up with a good reason as to<br/>
why Burned Out Lightstones are NO DROP I&#39;d be a bit happier.<br/>
The normal and greater lightstones aren&#39;t NO DROP, so why<br/>
the useless burned out ones?<br/>
