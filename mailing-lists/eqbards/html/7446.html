<div id="ygrps-yiv-640352872">You argued that their spells are useful later on.  Snare is nifty, but as<br/>
useful as Kellin&#39;s Lull?, no.  As useful as Acellerando?, no.  At 9th level,<br/>
and obviously before,if not for our entire careers, our spells are far more<br/>
a defining part of our characters than any of the &#39;hybrids&#39; (RNG,PAL,SHD).<br/>
As far as I have heard it is NEVER suggested that any of these classes stand<br/>
back and just cast spells in a group.  Most on this list advocate that role<br/>
for bards later in levels.  The main point was we are more dependant on<br/>
spells than RNG, PAL, or SHD.  We are at least as dependent on spells as<br/>
Shamans and Clerics, though probably not druids.  There have even been<br/>
articles proclaiming Shamans to be the ultimate warrior class.  Buff like<br/>
mad, rush into melee cause you&#39;re big, strong, have armor equal to a ranger,<br/>
and a big stick to swing.  If bards should be standing back and taking a<br/>
caster role, doesn&#39;t that make us more like, than unlike, those classes<br/>
whatever they are?<br/>

&gt; At my current (and everyone in my now guild&#39;s) rate of progression we will<br/>

&gt; approximately 2.5 years.  That&#39;s 128 patches.  I doubt the game will look<br/>
<br/>
Snare is level 9.  As are the first buffs.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; much like it does now at that point.  Why does everyone seem to<br/>
continually<br/>
&gt; use the argument &quot;Wait until you are X level, then things balance out&quot;<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; X is invariably well above 20?  Shouldn&#39;t a game be balanced at all levels<br/>
&gt; of play?<br/>
<br/>
Dunno where you got this idea from.  The only inequality I see<br/>
at low levels (aside from a couple class balance issues) is<br/>
that nearly everyone, even casters, are pretty good at melee.  <br/>
So that necessitates the early hybrid spells not be so<br/>
powerful to maintain balance.<br/>
