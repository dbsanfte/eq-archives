&gt;Even worse is the fact that on Veeshan right now for some reason or <br/>
&gt;another, people level 1-4 aren&#39;t spawning with Food, Water or their default <br/>
&gt;weapon after they die. Someone tell me how in the world a level 1-4 player <br/>
&gt;is supposed to advance with no weapon? I mean, the lack of food and water <br/>
&gt;is just an annoying &quot;Out Of&quot; message, but no weapon? Several bug reports <br/>
&gt;and petitions later and no response.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is also happening in Brell Serilis (level 2 Bar SHM).  I petitioned<br/>
and the answer I got was to beg from higher level players.  Some help.<br/>
Personally, I dislike beggars and will never beg for anything.  It&#39;s too<br/>
bad that the GM&#39;s either won&#39;t or aren&#39;t allowed to help with this legit<br/>
problem.  <br/>
<br/>
What did I do?  I went back to my guild, trained one point in Hand to Hand,<br/>
then proceeded to happen upon a decaying skellie with a cracked staff.  I<br/>
beat it to death, a very un-Shaman-like thing to do.  Got the staff, but<br/>
still dang hungry tho....<br/>
