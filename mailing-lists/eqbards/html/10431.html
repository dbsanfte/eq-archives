<div id="ygrps-yiv-165822673">it&#39;s on Rokenn&#39;s site on the home page under 11/19 news.  Geoffrey Zatkin,<br/>
the Archmage of Norrath, confirmed this as nothing more than a myth.  it&#39;s<br/>
been said a million times, but like all myths some people will remain<br/>
believing the lie.  oh well, i think with GZ confirming there really is no<br/>
issue anymore.  we just need to all spread this as much as we can.<br/>
surprisingly, i have yet to encounter anyone claiming this in a group i am<br/>
in, though i have gotten tells from people asking if it was true or not.<br/>
it&#39;s here at:<br/>

&gt; The song analysis site says that Jaxan&#39;s does not increase mana<br/>
&gt; recovery, and that this was confirmed by Verant... Who confirmed it?<br/>
&gt; When? What did they say? Please provide original text and <br/>
&gt; exact names if<br/>
&gt; possible, i&#39;d like to put this issue to rest (again).<br/>
