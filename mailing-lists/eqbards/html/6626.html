I do this all the time with my enchanter.  The enchanter&#39;s<br/>
illusions can change your factions (so that, say, undead, are<br/>
amiable to you), but any accumulated faction changes due to<br/>
quests or kills are added to your new faction (so that the<br/>
undead will still attack you in skeleton form).  When we&#39;re<br/>
fighting something that I don&#39;t want to take a faction hit<br/>
from, I just resort to pre-buffing and mesmerizing and let the<br/>
rest of the party do the killing.  They get the experience and<br/>
faction hits, I just get the experience.<br/>
