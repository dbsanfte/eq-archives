&gt;It&#39;s found off of Regis, a rare spawn in North Karana. Kill Zahal the Vile <br/>
&gt;(another rare spawn in North Karana) to make Regis spawn.<br/>

&gt;The flute is a quest item which you give to the gyspsy, Lianna Ferasa, in <br/>
&gt;Rathe Mtns in return for the Icon of the Reverent, which is required for <br/>
&gt;the Cleric&#39;s Bracers of the Reverent quest from the Temple of Solusek Ro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry, never tested it for effects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I may have missed it, but have you included your url for the various <br/>
&gt;commands? It&#39;s a very handy list that would help with the twisting commands.<br/>
