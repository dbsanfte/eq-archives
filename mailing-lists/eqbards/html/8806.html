<div id="ygrps-yiv-818447679">speaking of fear, our server had just been able to break through 2 days ago<br/>
for the first time since they nerfed it many weeks ago. last night was the<br/>
first time i returned since then.  in those earlier visits i obtained<br/>
imbrued boot and legs, and i was happy to have even gotten that (got a helm<br/>
too but helms don&#39;t count being a wood elf).  well last night within 10<br/>
minutes i got an imbrued breastplate.  we killed the boogey who had it, and<br/>
about 6 other mobs came so the GG word was given out.  since our group got<br/>
the kill and the loot time had not run out, everyone yelled for me to loot<br/>
it, it was either i loot it or it poofs.  i felt bad, but the same thing has<br/>
happened many times in PoF.  so i now have the only 3 pieces i ever wanted<br/>
of imbrued, to go along with the full set of lambent.  my wife is gonna have<br/>
a field day with her new wardrobes.<br/>

&gt; wandering mobs <br/>
&gt; in PoF, but since they are still new at hunting their they <br/>
&gt; get their butts <br/>
&gt; kicked regularly. Here&#39;s to perseverance!<br/>
