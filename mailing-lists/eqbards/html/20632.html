&gt; Basically any song/affect with a &quot;duration&quot; cannot be stacked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This makes sense of course, but I am still left explaining what appened in a<br/>
2 bard 1 cleric group (all 34) at the giant fort in the Frontier mountains.<br/>
With only 3 it very much seemed like you could easily see the effect of<br/>
different strategies when fighting tumps.The cleric was only healing, the<br/>
other bard was a fellow I know and who said the effects didn&#39;t stack, I said<br/>
I thought they did, so as an experiment he switched from Melee to all<br/>
instrument. <br/>
We were taking about the same damage and the cleric was finishing with the<br/>
same mana. The cleric reported that the health was indeed dropping faster on<br/>
the tump,  both us bards being a little too busy to really judge. We fought<br/>
for about an hour this way, and if one of us was doing no more than punching<br/>
damage (and allowing fewer knocks out of songs) that means that one of us<br/>
was superfluous, but I am certain a group of one bard and a cleric would not<br/>
do nearly as well.<br/>
I understand this is not a very scientific study, at all, but it seemed<br/>
pretty convincing at the time. Has anyone actually methodically checked it?<br/>
I am happy to be wrong, but I would be happier being wrong with a good<br/>
explanation for what happened :o)<br/>
