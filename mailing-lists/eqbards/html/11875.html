<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019108469"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 		Anyway, my point, I guess is that while I AGREE personally<br/>
&gt; that a shaman should Togors before DOTing, DOTing takes less mana and is<br/>
&gt; much faster casting...and sometimes the malise is worth it on high resistant<br/>
&gt; mobs if it helps the casters do full damage instead of 12.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You&#39;ve also got to take into account the monster being fought.<br/>
  <br/>
  Monster analysis:  Lava Duct Crawler.<br/>
<br/>
  hp.......: several thousands.<br/>
  attack...: double, kick, bash<br/>
  dmg......: 110 max dmg, average 80.<br/>
  special..: blood boil, hundreds of hp dot.<br/>
<br/>
  This thing will (pardon the abbrev) F you up big time if you let it.<br/>
  And that&#39;s the key:  &#39;If you let it.&#39;   These things must absolutely<br/>
  be stunned or slowed down first.  Malaising this thing and putting a<br/>
  poison DoT on it only gonna piss it off and it&#39;s still gonna be <br/>
  pounding the crap out of someone.  We had a cleric for healing,<br/>
  the shaman would be more efficient as a buff and debuff tool imo.<br/>
  <br/>
  Party dynamics and monster randomness create many different <br/>
  scenarios which you, the bard or enchanter, need to pick up<br/>
  on and adapt quickly to.  Having the shaman finish at 20m and<br/>
  the cleric at 80m creates downtime.  I try to (and this is tough)<br/>
  based on the mob fought and group makeup, determine the best <br/>
  role for everyone.  Am I perfect at it?  No way.  But it helps<br/>
  everyone in the long run if they try things out.  I am always<br/>
  open to suggestions, although I usually receive very little <br/>
  input.  (Due to the more commanding role maybe?)  I am always<br/>
  on the ball when I play, so much so that people are like can<br/>
  you please play the manasong... and I&#39;m like that&#39;s what you&#39;ve<br/>
  been hearing for the last 5 mins &lt;g&gt;.  Some people just cannot<br/>
  keep up with us sometimes.  ;)<br/>
