&gt; I haven&#39;t experienced this for myself (I didn&#39;t die while I was 31st) but<br/>
&gt; some friends of mine have and this is their theory.  The theory is that that<br/>
&gt; there are three different level types: regular levels, hell levels, and<br/>
&gt; hell+1 levels.  The EXP required to get through each level type is<br/>
&gt; different.  For example purposes, lets say it take 2000 EXP points to get<br/>
&gt; from 34 to 35 level (regular).  To get from 35 to 36 it takes 4000 EXP<br/>
&gt; points (hell).  From 36 to 37 it only takes 1000 EXP points (hell +1).<br/>
&gt; However, when you die, you lose the same amount of experience no matter what<br/>
&gt; level you are.  So in this case, dying at 34th amounts to 1/2 bar loss, 1/4<br/>
&gt; bar lossat 35, and a full bar at 36.  The end result is that when you die<br/>
&gt; during a hell+1 level, it appears that you lose more EXP because the EXP bar<br/>
&gt; drops more than it would if you were in a regular or hell level.  But in<br/>
&gt; actuality you lost the same amount of EXP.  The converse to this is that<br/>
&gt; because it doesn&#39;t take as much EXP to gain the next level at hell+1 levels,<br/>
&gt; you can actually recover the lost EXP much faster.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Like I say this is all just a theory but I do know that it only took me one<br/>

<br/>
If the exp loss per death was the same regardless of level,<br/>
then my deaths at 31 and 47 should&#39;ve resulted in the same exp<br/>
loss as dying at 30 and 46.  They did not, which is strong<br/>
evidence that this theory is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Do you understand why I made it a point to use only deaths<br/>
which ocurred without my having gained *any* experience into<br/>
the new level?  That way the exp loss was for the new level,<br/>
but was applied entirely to the old level, letting me do a<br/>
direct comparison to deaths in the old level.<br/>
