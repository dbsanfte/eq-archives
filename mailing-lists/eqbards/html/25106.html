<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220072211">Talies is trying to tread lightly, since he/she (sorry, I have no idea<br/>
which..heh) wants to join the guild.  :)  Maybe it is worth that much, but<br/>
he/she may come across as a greedy lewt...(you know)...if he/she starts<br/>
asking for all that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, Talies, if you post a message on their message board, stating your<br/>
desire to join the guild, list a few of the things you&#39;d like to have, and<br/>
ask for suggestions on what they think they&#39;d be willing to give for it?<br/>
For all you know, they have a Plane/Dragon raid coming up soon, and would<br/>
love to default a &lt;insert phat lewt here&gt; to you in exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I&#39;d get their input.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Some people have all the luck...  heh<br/>

I know - it&#39;s freaky, don&#39;t know how it happened, but I also don&#39;t want to <br/>
take advantage of the guild, seeing as I want to join when I reach 30th <br/>
(minimum requirement for me to join).<br/>
<br/>
Is the Lute of the Howler tradeable?  I thought it was nodrop...<br/>
hrm - I see that it is not.<br/>
<br/>
How about this - request the Lute of the Howler (what&#39;s the worst he can <br/>
say? No?), and the ancient coins from Kaesora, Dalnir and City of <br/>
Mist?  I&#39;ve already got a bloodgill coin, and I see that the others are not <br/>
too hard.  That would get me two out of four really good instruments, not <br/>
bad for a young bard...<br/>
