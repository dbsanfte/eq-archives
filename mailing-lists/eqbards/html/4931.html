<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-783222"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What level are people who have trouble with<br/>
&gt; casters?  I have not had any trouble with<br/>
&gt; casting bandits, necros in Befallen, orc<br/>
&gt; casters in Kithicor etc.  Even the ones that<br/>
&gt; con yellow to me are possibly beatable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m currently level 16. I can beat a white/yellow derv usually by myself.<br/>
But most casting desert or island madmen (or Derv&#39;s) that con green are<br/>
fairly dangerous for me for some reason. They never seem to run out of mana,<br/>
they never seem to get interrupted by me successfully hitting them while<br/>
they&#39;re casting and they simply refuse to die. I don&#39;t even want to talk<br/>
about the ones that sit there and heal themselves while I&#39;m hacking their<br/>
body parts off. If you get into trouble with a caster, you&#39;re simply SOL<br/>
because you can&#39;t seem to outrun their spell range fast enough. (By trouble<br/>
I mean down to the last bubble or so)<br/>
<br/>
And of course, there&#39;s always the chance that it&#39;s just my tactics that<br/>
stink. *shrug* But I still despise fighting a caster alone.</div>
