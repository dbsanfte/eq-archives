&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, but this particular dagger is better than a<br/>
&gt; &gt; combine longsword. Same damage, better speed, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; buffs as well. probably less weight, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Quite a bargain<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I bought my combine for 30pp.. Someone wants 75pp for the dagger.. I&#39;m<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sorry<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can&#39;t recall the exact specs on the Dirk at the moment, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; believe they&#39;re worth 45pp (or even 20+pp if you had bought the CLS from a<br/>
&gt; gypsy for 50pp). But then again, that&#39;s just my opinion. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; start an off topic thread on weapons and such. =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You got a steal for the combine.  I can sell the combine to a amicable<br/>
vendor for 47.5pp.  And 75pp is way too high of a price for the Dirk.  They<br/>
can be had for much less than that.  Try shopping in or around Crushbone.<br/>
<br/>
You got a great deal on the Combine and a bad price on the Dirk.  So don&#39;t<br/>
compare an underpriced Combine against an overpriced Dirk.<br/>
<br/>
I bought my Combine from the gypsy for 52.5pp.  Then I bought the Dirk for<br/>
30pp from another player.  When dealing with players, there can be a huge<br/>
difference in prices.  Shop around and make some deals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dragoon Dirk -  6/23   +2 DEX +3 Magic<br/>
Combine LS  -  6/28<br/>
<br/>
The Dirk&#39;s extra speed will gain you an extra attack every 15 seconds over<br/>
the CLS.<br/>
