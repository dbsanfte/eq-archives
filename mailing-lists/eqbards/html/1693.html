<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827497772">To fuel the neverending debate on what are the most important stats for a<br/>
bard, I would like to do some research to determine what the average stats<br/>
are for bard characters.  If you want to participate, send me your<br/>
character&#39;s base stats.  Be sure to take off any item that<br/>
increases/decreases a stat.  If I get enough responses to make it a valid<br/>
sample I will publish the results.  I will publish the averages as well as<br/>
the standard deviations for each stats.<br/>
<br/>
No need to clutter up the mailing list for this so request you send me the<br/>
stats via email.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
