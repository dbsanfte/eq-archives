<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167749543">I believe the rumor is that they originally came from the 35+ underwater<br/>
dungeon that you get to from dagnor&#39;s cauldron called &quot;Kedge Keep&quot; and that<br/>
they have since been removed from the game.  I have also heard that they had<br/>
been given out as a reward in a GM-run event or quest on occasion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure other&#39;s will clarify/verify my rumors...<br/>

&gt; I have heared a lot of people talk about the sword of Ykesha and the<br/>
&gt; Wakizashi (sp:) as being two of the best weapons that a bard <br/>
&gt; can use.  Well<br/>
&gt; I was wondering about the Fanged Skull Stiletto which is DAM <br/>
&gt; 12 Delay 22<br/>
&gt; piercing and usable by Bards.  It is apparently not a lore <br/>
&gt; item so you could<br/>
&gt; in theory get two of these and be a virtual quisinart.  Does <br/>
&gt; anyone own one?<br/>
&gt; Know how to get one?  I have heard that they come from <br/>
&gt; somewhere in Dagnour<br/>
&gt; Cauldron.  Perhaps this item is so hard to get that it is not <br/>
&gt; realistic to<br/>
&gt; obtain untill really high levels.  Info please :)<br/>
