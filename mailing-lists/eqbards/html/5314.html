<div id="ygrps-yiv-739672009">I hate to ask this question again because I know we have gone over this<br/>
topic before on the list, but we have not discussed it for a while and<br/>
people might have some new data on it.<br/>
<br/>
I just made 24th a few days ago and got the &quot;Safe Fall&quot; skill...I trained it<br/>
up to 40 and I don&#39;t seem to be able to take it any higher, at least during<br/>
my initial trials - I fell from a high enough height to do damage to myself<br/>
over and over (about 20 times or so) until I was down to 1 bubble of XP and<br/>
it would not raise above 40.<br/>
<br/>
Are we capped at 40 for Safe Fall?  If so what a let-down...not much real<br/>
improvement over not having it all from what I have observed.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone on the list have any new or revised data on our Bard Skill Caps<br/>
they could share with us?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; Perhaps it was their computer?  I know for a fact that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; speed/connection of you computer is important in <br/>
&gt; determining your running<br/>
&gt; &gt; speed.  One night I went hunting a friend who was <br/>
&gt; attempting to run the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game on a Pentium 150 with 32mb RAM and suffice to say she <br/>
&gt; was insanely<br/>
&gt; &gt; slow.  Heck my mage was moving faster than her walking then she (a<br/>
&gt; &gt; paladin) was running.  So perhaps your connection was <br/>
&gt; better or perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; like we all know SOW just rocks.  Speaking of which being a bard has<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yup, that&#39;s why all the SoW timings I have were done via SoW<br/>
&gt; cast on my character.  Same computer, same connection, and<br/>
&gt; often times same location and time of day (accounting for<br/>
&gt; variable lag).  I always do a baseline check with normal<br/>
&gt; running speed every time I do another test, and normalize<br/>
&gt; against that before adding it to the chart.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm, I wonder if this means I have an excuse for getting<br/>
&gt; JBoots... :-)<br/>
