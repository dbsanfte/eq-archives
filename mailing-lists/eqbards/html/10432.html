<div id="ygrps-yiv-792908465">In my camping of the Icy Greaves last week, and last night&#39;s grouping in Kith, taking out high-level undead (the lowest thing con&#39;d gold to me at 28) I have noticed that although DDD may be more powerful, CoD will be resisited by higher level creatures MUCH less often.  About the only things that resisted it were red cons that were upper 30&#39;s-ish to maybe 40.  Don&#39;t take my word for it, try it yourself and see ;o)<br/>

&gt;DDD gives you just the &quot;blahblah winces&quot; message like CoD- but it is VERY<br/>
&gt;powerful! Make sure you put at least one point into your brass skill when<br/>
&gt;you train (i put a all I could as soon as I could) because it does take a<br/>
&gt;bit to fire up this song when you first start using it. I did ask a high<br/>
&gt;level bard what the best thing to do to max the song out was and he said go<br/>
&gt;to freeport newbie area... it did help, then I used it in EC in the easier<br/>
&gt;area and that helped, finally I got too impatient, so I just started using<br/>
&gt;it along with the other two (CoD and Hymn) and in 5 days it went from 30 or<br/>
&gt;40something to it being in the 70s now - can&#39;t wait until it catches the<br/>
&gt;rest of my instruments! One of the things I have found was that I&#39;ve started<br/>
&gt;using more than just the basic hotkey setups too - I have one for melee with<br/>
&gt;the inventory and melee slots - and one for songs (those two I use together<br/>
&gt;when grouping where I don&#39;t want to pull lots of things with the DDD/CoD<br/>
&gt;songs)- but I also have one that has DDD/CoD/Hymn AND a melee slot with two<br/>
&gt;inventory slots - where I switch the horn with the lute and have the drum<br/>
&gt;handy in case I need to run....<br/>
