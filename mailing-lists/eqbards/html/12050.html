<div id="ygrps-yiv-843501249">I&#39;d LOVE to see that analysis also.  In fact, I tend to party with a BUNCH<br/>
of shamans (this weekend I organized and pulled for 2 full parties with a<br/>
total of 5 shamans split between them).  We&#39;ve been using a combinition of<br/>
Regen on everybody, Hymn and their canibilizm (with regen and heal AND<br/>
clarity) to keep downtime to a minimum.  The shamans are doing most of the<br/>
healing so that our only druid can save his mana for Evac and snares.  Since<br/>
our nukers, tanks and healers were evenly split between both parties, I did<br/>
a lot of switching teams to help out the low mana/low health group.  The<br/>
funny thing was that the team I was part of always seemed to get the bulk of<br/>
the XP for any given pull :-).  For while there, we were camping the<br/>
torturer, kings with an occasional trip to the bar room all at once and<br/>
before that we had the EXG, predator, foreman, Singe and Kindle :-).<br/>
CONSTANT pulling.  I had to buy an timer that I could set for 20 minutes so<br/>
that I knew when the spawn cycle was about to start over or if we needed to<br/>
skip a location because of a painful pull.  We got Charred Guardian Shields<br/>
for just about every shaman and druid in the clan plus extras.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
believe the loot that we walked out of there with (foreman tunics, kobold<br/>
hide boots, imp skin gloves, bone hoops, drake hide sleeves and pants,<br/>
turquoise eye patches, ring of the goblin king, charred guardian shields,<br/>
etc).  With one more bard, I believe we would have been able to grab the<br/>
captain and the efreet also!  In fact, I think that I was the only party<br/>
member that didn&#39;t get a nice new piece of equipment (not that I need one! I<br/>
already have 3 shards, 2 tunics, 1 pants, 1 belt, 2 hoops in the bank), but<br/>
I did get my lambent BP finally!  (Thanks Orchestro!)<br/>
<br/>
No downtime is the key.  My motto has always been that if anyone has more<br/>
then 50% mana, then the pulling isn&#39;t fast enough!<br/>
<br/>
O yeah, Lullaby is great for pulling that frenzied Sol Gob off the Nuker who<br/>
nuked to early also :-).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Lament for pulling, Levitate for emergencies (someone ALWAYS<br/>
&gt; falls into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lava... especially fighting CWG&#39;s and EXG&#39;s), and Screech for<br/>
&gt; when we need<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   LOL...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Taneran, also opinionated but willing to try new things ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Nah ;-P   &quot;You got game.&quot;  hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I just thought you were healing in battle ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   We need an analysis of Heal/Mana mix versus straight Mana with<br/>
&gt;   healers doing the Healing.  At higher levels it&#39;s not efficient<br/>
&gt;   enough to play Hymm on tanks who have up to 2000 hp.  With the<br/>
&gt;   pack regen spells, and word of health spells, it&#39;s definitely<br/>
&gt;   more efficient to go straight mana.  I&#39;m not sure about L35<br/>
&gt;   or less though.  I am the master of low downtime, but I&#39;m curious<br/>
&gt;   if around L35 it&#39;s better to twist both or play one.  I guess<br/>
&gt;   the all encompassing &#39;it depends&#39; rule applies here.  =)<br/>
