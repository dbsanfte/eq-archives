&gt; &gt; In cases where Hymn is needed I will weave it regards of the finger-wiggler <br/>

&gt; &gt; again.  It keeps everyone happy and the cleric does not have to top everyone <br/>
&gt; &gt; off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Usually in our parties there&#39;s a ranger or paladin happy to do that or a<br/>
&gt; druid who casts regen before everyone sits. Personally I&#39;m happy for a<br/>
&gt; break from the tendonitis inducing song weaving, which I do quite enough<br/>
&gt; of in combat. I&#39;d rather keep my fingers free for the resting chatter<br/>
&gt; and strategy discussion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our L40 druid was casting pack regeneration on us after or<br/>
during particularly nasty fights.  It&#39;s only 6 hp/tick, but<br/>
it&#39;s usually sufficient to do what jhenderson says - get<br/>
everyone back to full health before they&#39;re full mana.<br/>
<br/>
Just make sure the druid knows that they must wait for Hymn to<br/>
wear off before they cast the spell.  Otherwise it will not<br/>
take hold.<br/>

I&#39;ve gotten very good at<br/>
<br/>
typing in short spurts<br/>
<br/>
between changing songs<br/>
<br/>
during combat too.  :-)<br/>
