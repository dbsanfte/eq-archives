the squad ring quest, I accidently gave the sherriff three<br/>
Runnyeye warbeads and one shattered warbead, thus not getting<br/>
credit for turning in four.  After that I concentrated on orcs<br/>
in WC and just turned in belts for about a week.  While in<br/>
Misty to turn in the belts, I killed a goblin to save someone<br/>
else and got a Runnyeye warbead.  Curious to see if this would<br/>
qualify as my 4th, I turned it in and sure enough I got<br/>
experience for having turned in 4.<br/>

Btw, does anyone know how to raise faction with the clerics in<br/>
Rivervale?  It&#39;s annoying having to use a faction raising<br/>
spell every time I want to recharge the ring.  They took out<br/>
the faction gains/losses for recharging/getting the ring when<br/>
they made it no-drop.  I suppose I could just destroy them and<br/>
get another from the marshall, but I don&#39;t want to lose the<br/>
ring if they ever raise the faction requirement to get it.<br/>
