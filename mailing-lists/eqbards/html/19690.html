<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I quite agree.  The chain/fear/backstab combo is devastating to watch.  The<br/>
group I mentioned previously had a Rogue (hi Shadess!) and she really knows<br/>
her class.  So what if she picks the pocket of the mob we&#39;re attacking from<br/>
time to time, she&#39;s got the skill so she should use it.<br/>
<br/>
Rogues have been given a bad rap, much in the same way that we have over the<br/>
whole experience sham.  It&#39;s a group&#39;s loss if they refuse to let one join.<br/>
