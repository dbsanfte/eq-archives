<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243278831">So does that mean he doesn&#39;t charm anymore?  That used to be a very buggy<br/>
area where unsuspecting people could get charmed through the walls (without<br/>
ever even seeing Meldrath at all).  Then of course, he&#39;d march you straight<br/>
into his lair with the mino guards.  Heh.  Died 6 times trying to recover<br/>
Laluni&#39;s corpse from there very shortly after release at about level 10.  <br/>

&gt;Meldrath was the first time I intentionally dropped Elemental<br/>
&gt;Rhythms in favor of Purifying Rhythms.  The fear spell was bad<br/>
&gt;enough, but my party was being reamed by the DoTs (L38 bard<br/>
&gt;and ranger, L31 cleric).  Individually the mobs there are not<br/>
&gt;difficult, but the spawn time is 7 minutes, and just as you<br/>
&gt;finish up the last mob, the first one spawns again.  By the<br/>
&gt;time we finally got a small break, everyone was down to almost<br/>
&gt;one bubble and OOM.  Don&#39;t walk in there expecting it to be a<br/>
&gt;pushover because everything is green or blue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At the high 30s, you resist his fear spell a lot, but he casts<br/>
&gt;it so often that eventually one gets through (even with me<br/>
&gt;playing Purifying Rhythms with a MM drum).  That leaves your<br/>
&gt;party one man down, which in a party of 2 or 3 is a tremendous<br/>
&gt;handicap.<br/>
