&gt; &gt; Geez, this guy just uses way too many words to say something that&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; &gt; said to death. The computer gaming industry uses sex to sell it&#39;s games.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Real old hat. I mean, we had to hear all of this stuff with Laura<br/>
&gt; &gt; Croft/Tomb Raider. Guess he was getting paid by the word. :-b<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The irony with Laura Croft is that a lot of the guys supposedly being drawn<br/>
&gt;through a horny objectification of women are actually drawn to Laura, as<br/>
&gt;opposed to some other chick, because she is assertive, confident, and<br/>
&gt;competent. Competent heros attract people more than the &quot;elites&quot; realize,<br/>
&gt;either for purposes of lust or self-identification.<br/>

now ;)  Cate Archer is a good strong female character.  Plus it&#39;s a <br/>
well-designed game.<br/>
