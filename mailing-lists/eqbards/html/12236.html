<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-174748792">Am I interpreting his last statement correctly? The way I read it, casters<br/>
being able to bind in a dungeon zone is a bug.  That would seem to indicate<br/>
that Verant&#39;s original intent was that casters could only bind in cities and<br/>
outdoor zones.  I&#39;ve never heard that discussed anywhere before so that lead<br/>
to my confusion on his statement.<br/>
<br/>
This may not even be that big of a deal anyway.  Most casters I know bind<br/>
themselves in the zone right outside the dungeon entrance, i.e. bind in<br/>
Lavastorm if they are adventuring in Sol B.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; We are also considering making it such that casters cannot bind in<br/>
&gt; Expansion dungeons (the fact that they can now is actually a bug that is<br/>
&gt; too late to fix for the rest of the world). <br/>
