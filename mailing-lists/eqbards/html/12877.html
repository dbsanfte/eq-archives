<b>Subject:</b> Level 39 song should be..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-16601000">We had this discussion a few months ago about our invis song working against<br/>
undead.  At the time, I was around 24th level.  I remember it well because I<br/>
was in Unrest at the time we had the discussion.  At 24th level, I could<br/>
walk around the outside and first floor of Unrest fairly safely.  About the<br/>
only thing that could see thru the invis was a carrion ghoul or higher.  I<br/>
left Unrest and didn&#39;t go back until I was 30th level.  Last week I went all<br/>
the way to the ghost room without getting attacked.  Along the way I passed<br/>
a dark terror, werebat, barbed bone skele and festering hag.  Don&#39;t think<br/>
the first two are considered undead but the last two are for certain.  I<br/>
know for certain the barbed and festering hag conned indifferent to me,<br/>
indicating they didn&#39;t see thru the invis song.  Of particular note is that<br/>
the barbed conned blue to me while the hag was even.  When I was 24th level,<br/>
these two were both higher level than me and definately saw thru invis. IMO,<br/>
I think bard invis working against undead, at least the ones in Unrest, is a<br/>
factor of both your level and randomness.<br/>
<br/>
If Verant decided to give us universal invis to undead somewhere down the<br/>
road, to me the solution is simple.  Make it where the invis song, when<br/>
equipping a magical flute, works against undead.  Of course this would<br/>
require them to add a magical flute into the game other than those dropped<br/>
by gods.  <br/>

&gt; Clouding -IS- invisibility to live or Undead with modification to level.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have at level 22 walked completely unmolested though Unrest mansion with<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; active.  As soon as I dropped it I was attacked.  I have walked through<br/>
&gt; befallen with the same results.  I have no doubt that our clouding is a<br/>
&gt; universal invisability and was intended as one, there for we do not need<br/>
&gt; invis vs undead.  I think the problem is that many of you who have had<br/>
&gt; troubles with this either had bad parties that broke the invis (wandered<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; of range, attacked, cast looted) at which point you also become visiable,<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; are trying to hide from undead levels much higher then you where it I<br/>
&gt; guess<br/>
&gt; resisted the song.  I personally would like to see a true mem blur song..<br/>
&gt; except GZ and crew are more worried about enchanters and balancing us to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; lesser the ever present curse of jack of all trades master of none motief,<br/>
&gt; then the actual usefulness of bards.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t buy into the theory that mobs get a saving throw to detect<br/>
&gt; invisibility.  If they can see invis, they see invis.  If they can&#39;t, and<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re wearing it, you&#39;re invis.  I&#39;ve walked unmolested thru the toes of<br/>
&gt; Ice Giants in Permafrost to recover a friends corpse at level 27.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt; been seen (unknowingly) and drew a train of undead to the Blood Pool in<br/>
&gt; Unrest around the same level (can&#39;t think of any mob in the path that was<br/>
&gt; major red to me).  I was the ONLY one in my group, and I assure you that I<br/>
&gt; did nothing to break invis.  There may be some invis to undead aspect to<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; songs, but it&#39;s not because the mob gets a saving throw.<br/>
