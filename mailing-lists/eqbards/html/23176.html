<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120071608"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; which COULD be the case depending on how verant programs level <br/>
 </span></blockquote>checks.  if they really have a separate experience table to check <br/>
against for each value of experience penalty, i.e. one for troll <br/>
sk&#39;s, one for iksar monks, etc, etc, then the system they have works <br/>
fine. if they create one experience table and &#39;&#39;normalize&#39;&#39; <br/>
experience to it, i.e. calculate experience by this formula:  <br/>
Exp_gained = Base_exp * class_pen * race_pen, then they have really <br/>
just moved the penalty, although it is much more easily avoided, as <br/>
in get a rez or just don&#39;t die.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you show me an example with your above formula to show how the <br/>
penalty would be moved?  I&#39;m don&#39;t grasp the concept you&#39;re stating <br/>
with just the formula.</div>
