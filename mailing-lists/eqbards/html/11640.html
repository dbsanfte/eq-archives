<div id="ygrps-yiv-819580611">Now I&#39;m confused.  Why didn&#39;t your song graphics show up?  You mentioned it but<br/>
left out the explanation.  Do you get no song graphics if you are wearing a<br/>
Guise? Did the ranger quit because he thought you weren&#39;t singing any songs?  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Just saw that this had been changed in the patch.  Anyone have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; info?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I happened to join the first supply room group after the server came back<br/>
&gt; up postpatch Wednesday afternoon.  The leader of the group, a 46 woodelf<br/>
&gt; ranger, impressed me with his organizational skills.  He had us (well, the<br/>
&gt; others who were more or less soloers acting together) working together<br/>
&gt; with some decent tactics going on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, once the guise showed up, he got extremely pissed and left<br/>
&gt; midfight.  I was rather confused as to why my song graphics weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; showing up till I realized what had happened.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then a barbarian warrior shows up, doesn&#39;t tell us he&#39;s new to the area,<br/>
&gt; and falls off the walkway.  I sat up there watching him die, eventually<br/>
&gt; someone went down and had a spell cast on them (by one of the NPCs).  I<br/>
&gt; tell the wizard Get ready to evac, and about 30 seconds after the<br/>
&gt; warrior&#39;s death, the room is mobbed by about 5 frogloks (more on the way,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure), along with a handful of greater darkbone skeletons.<br/>
