<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694768711">The Damage Shield message will only display the most damaging shield. (IE: Pierced by Thorns.)<br/>
<br/>
Your Chilled to the bone should not appear unless Thorns falls off.<br/>

&gt; Curious to see if this was a stealth nerf, I tried it out on a few other mobs...(gnolls and a corrupt guard) and saw the message show just fine...has anyone else run into this?  Are Seafuries imune to cold shields?<br/>
