<div id="ygrps-yiv-630239375">Well, as a Wood Elf I do fine with my forgaing, but could understand the<br/>
frustration from others.<br/>
<br/>
What I still don&#39;t understand is why bother giving us hide or sneak when the<br/>
cap is so low one will not risk using the skill?  Even with my HIGHER cap as<br/>
a Wood Elf, any time I would find hiding useful I just would never use it.<br/>
Why?  Hide and I&#39;d more likely be killed than saved.  Very very likely<br/>
killed.  One can depend on hiding failure at our cap, with no way to tell<br/>
success.  So hide stays hidden in the skills menu, never hotkeyed.  O, and<br/>
thanks for the sneak, just in time for the song which replaces it!<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m certain Safe Fall a bard would find more useful than a monk.  Almost<br/>
broke my neck travelling through Oasis with my Accelerado beat going.<br/>
Suppose that&#39;s capped to the point it never works either though, don&#39;t have<br/>
it yet.<br/>

    Hello, my fellow soloists<br/>
    I have a bone to pick with Verant.  Why give us the ability to forage if<br/>
the skill cap is 40.  The whole point for foraging is that it can take the<br/>
place of buying food.  So you can rely on it to meet all you dietary needs.<br/>
I am a lvl 14 bard and my forage is maxed.  I use it constantly and very<br/>
rarely do i ever get any rewards for my persistence.  I say we all ban<br/>
together and e-mail Verant demanding they increase the skill lvl.  I mean<br/>
why not, it&#39;s not like we can use the skill to make any money at it... LETS<br/>
BAND TOGETHER FELLOW BARDS AND DEMAND VERANT TO ADD THIS TO THE NEXT<br/>
PATCH.....<br/>
<br/>
    Sing loud and proud fellow bards...</div>
