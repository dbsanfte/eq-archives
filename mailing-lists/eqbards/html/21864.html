&gt; now, is atk like ac in that it is made of up 2 numbers, like chance to hit, and damage<br/>
&gt; done, sorta like damage avoidance and damage absorption?  if so, then real damage<br/>

dispite it&#39;s raising ATK, just as the contribution of AGI is minimal<br/>
dispite it&#39;s raising of AC.<br/>

months ago. Not sure if it&#39;s still there but you could ask if someone<br/>
has it archived.<br/>
