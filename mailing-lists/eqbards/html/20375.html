<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-679388467">i haven&#39;t been to fear for ages, but i believe the only two bard items there<br/>
are the imbrued bracer and the darkwood picollo off cazic.<br/>
<br/>
not too much for tactics, but from what i can remember have a haste song,<br/>
mystic shielding for MR (i don&#39;t think much of anything there casts fire or<br/>
cold), and you can mem levitate for fighting those wisps or whatever casts<br/>
grav flux.  i am not sure if you can charm anything with bravura at level<br/>
48.<br/>
<br/>
breaking in is a different story, i hope you are going with some experienced<br/>
groups.  have invis memmed in case the invis you get upon zoning in drops<br/>
(they see invis but invis lowers aggro radius).  have selo&#39;s memmed if you<br/>
don&#39;t have sow and you need to kite anything while the groups kill, or sow<br/>
drops on the way to your camp, that sort of thing.  if you get attacked,<br/>
don&#39;t train your group, just die and wait for CR =)  and good luck and have<br/>
fun!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Ok, we have gone over this before but I would like to request a quick<br/>
&gt; refresher course from the senior bards on the list.  I am <br/>
&gt; getting ready to<br/>
&gt; go to Fear for my first time soon and I was wondering a few <br/>
&gt; things about the<br/>
&gt; zone maybe you guys and gals can help me with:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. What kinds of items should a bard try to get in on a lotto <br/>
&gt; for in fear?<br/>
&gt; As far as I understand it, the only bard stuff that drops there is the<br/>
&gt; crumby imbrued bracer?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. What kind of tactics should a bard use in fear?  Obviously <br/>
&gt; mana song, but<br/>
&gt; what else is good up there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. Got any other little tips for a bard heading to his first planar<br/>
&gt; experience?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; TIA </span></blockquote></div>
