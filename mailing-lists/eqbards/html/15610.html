&gt;running around in a virtual world.  To prevent it from<br/>
&gt;dissolving into the anarchy where every guttersnipe can get<br/>
&gt;away with whatever he wants to do, you need a social support<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem is that game mechanics, which are a simple system,  can never<br/>
ever hope to address the highly complex organic system that is human<br/>
behavior. It just can&#39;t be done. Look at Faction Hits on RZ, it seems<br/>
obvious that you should take a faction hit for killing your own race right?<br/>
Well, that is like saying that anyone who kills another person IRL, no<br/>
matter what the cause, is ostracized from society. Even if the person doing<br/>
the killing is a Peace Officer is of the highest moral fiber and the person<br/>
killed is holding a gun to a child&#39;s head, with the safety off and squeezing<br/>
the trigger. The dead guy had not committed the  crime yet when he was shot,<br/>
and yes had he done it he  would have been ostracized by society, but that<br/>
does the child no good at all.<br/>
And this is a comic-book simple situation, not at all in the gray area that<br/>
we all spend 99.9% of our on- or off-line time in.<br/>
I have watched the interaction between social systems and game mechanics in<br/>
UO and EQ, in both cases out of a desire to become skilled in social<br/>
engineering in online  communities, for large scale story-writing as well as<br/>
a method of discovering how they work. I have flummoxed and confused lots<br/>
and lots of people in a manner  that caught them up in the story, raised<br/>
huge angry (and RL angry, not just RP&#39;d)  mobs (groups of crazy people, not<br/>
mobiles :o) and essentially learned to reach through the computer and<br/>
emotionally hook the people behind the avatars as well as modify motivations<br/>
to effect their in-game behavior. It is /really really/ hard, immensely<br/>
subtle and  any given effort only succeeds a small fraction of the time.<br/>
Because essentially we are free to turn off the computer, &quot;rules&quot; and<br/>
&quot;demands&quot; don&#39;t work out here because no one has the right, or ability to<br/>
enforce, any requirement on my or anyone else&#39;s behavior. Therefore if you<br/>
want a specific result all you can do is provide a path for people to walk<br/>
and make it look desirable enough that they will walk it of their own free<br/>
will.<br/>
 Why did Dark Unity work so well on RZ before faction? Because it was cool<br/>
idea, way cool, a *voluntary* support system for the evil races. Why did the<br/>
Imperium thrive on Napa and now thrives on Siege Perilous? Because it is a<br/>
cool idea, (and well executed by creative people - the foundation of the<br/>
Imperium is in it&#39;s Laws, Laws which the game mechanics don&#39;t support) and<br/>
people may hate it for it&#39;s &quot;oppressiveness&quot; (which it isn&#39;t :o), but they<br/>
want it more than boredom and random violence. so the *choose* to support<br/>
the Imperium story.<br/>
Laws and social systems can&#39;t be coded in to a game with more than one<br/>
person playing it, all you can do is code to minimize the effects of those<br/>
who see freedom as lack of consequences for selfishness, after that it is up<br/>
to the players to *make* something out of the tools of their world, and make<br/>
the benefits of what they have created so desirable that people want to<br/>
support it.<br/>
