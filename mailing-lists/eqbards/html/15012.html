<div id="ygrps-yiv-808411913">I met beggar that took the cake last night.  I was standing in the West<br/>
Freeport Gates talking to a friend I hadn&#39;t seen in a long time when a<br/>
fellow came up and inspected unannounced.  I ignored him, then a few minutes<br/>
later he sent me a tell asking if I would buy the BBC that my friend was<br/>
wearing and give it to him.  *boggle* <br/>
<br/>
Guess he didn&#39;t like my stuff.<br/>
