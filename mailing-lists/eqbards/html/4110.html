&gt; Psalm of Warmth is a very very very useful song if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; soloing.  When soloing, nearly anything that gives you<br/>
&gt; experience is going to hit you lots and lots of times.  With<br/>
&gt; the Psalm of Warmth&#39;s fire shield, your opponent takes damage<br/>
&gt; every time he hits you.  At L27 it was &quot;only&quot; 4 points per<br/>
&gt; hit, but considering you&#39;re probably going to be hit 20-40<br/>
&gt; times in a solo fight, that&#39;s 80-160 points of free damage.<br/>

seems to have a nasty interaction bug with the Guise of the Deceiver<br/>
Dark Elf illusion. One of the people I party with is a Troll and the<br/>
Dark Elf illusion has been a godsend for dungeon crawling, as it&#39;s<br/>
fairly obvious that most dungeons weren&#39;t really designed to fit the<br/>
large races very well. However, when the Psalm ended, it also killed my<br/>
Troll friend&#39;s ultravision in Dark Elf mode. Weird bug. Psalm only does<br/>
7 dmg at L47 though, so it&#39;s not a huge loss, but as you point out,<br/>
those points add up in a long fight with a fast hitting mob.<br/>
