<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565973812">While I agree Verant seems bound and determined to make EQ so bad<br/>
that we&#39;ll all pay 50 bucks for EQ2 just to get on with it, the<br/>
recent change in GM events is a step in the right direction:<br/>
<br/>
On Nameless last night they continued with the bard/dragon/mistmoore<br/>
saga and in Steamfont all 3 made an appearance.  Those causing<br/>
trouble were first booted then summoned to very remote locations with<br/>
rez effects.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, instead of who can kill what the quickest the GM&#39;s rewarded<br/>
RP&#39;ing - not just those people who spam grovel and bow, etc, but<br/>
people who attempted to interact with the story line.  In the end a<br/>
teens druid with a fs scimitar and mixed leather armor got a RBB and<br/>
a low 20s bard was rumored to have gotten a faydragon lyre (looked<br/>
like a blue lute from what I was told, don&#39;t know the stats).<br/>
<br/>
There was tremendous belly aching and moaning in lguk later about how<br/>
it was unfair, the characters didn&#39;t deserve the goods, couldn&#39;t<br/>
appreciate them, etc but I agreed completely with the out come and I<br/>
typed a novel on /feedback supporting the move.  Too bad<br/>
/feedback--&gt;/dev/null. ;)<br/>
