&gt; All in the same fight? Am I reading this right? You were fighting Lady Vox<br/>
&gt; and 3 other mobs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, the gory details.<br/>
<br/>
We got Vox down to about 20%.  Out of my group, only the<br/>
enchanter and I were left, me at a bubble and half and she at<br/>
a bubble.  There were about a dozen people still alive, maybe<br/>
a half dozen of them melee so I joined in the melee attack.  <br/>
Then the priest of Nagafen respawned (this was our 4th<br/>
attempt) and attacked me.  I quickly got knocked to *NO* red<br/>
showing on my hp bar.  I figured the middle of Vox&#39;s lair<br/>
would not make for good corpse recovery so I walked away to<br/>
find nice place to die.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason the priest stopped attacking me.  I found<br/>
myself next to the enchanter (at a half bubble now) so I<br/>
switched to healing both of us to give her a better chance of<br/>
being able to gate out.  I got myself up to a bubble, her to a<br/>
bubble and half, took another Vox AE breath attack, dropped to<br/>
half bubble, and walked further out of range.  The priest<br/>
attacked me again, so I took a couple swipes (I think I<br/>
punched that time :), dropped to *NO* red showing again,<br/>
turned and walked away so I&#39;d die outside of Vox&#39;s lair, and<br/>
the priest left me again.<br/>
<br/>
I found the enchanter again, healed both of us a bit.  I was<br/>
expecting to get summoned at any moment but for some reason it<br/>
never happened.  A couple of the returning casters brought<br/>
some goblins and giants, so I went to pull those off them.  <br/>
Lost the enchanter at this point (she fell into a pit and<br/>
ended up gating out).  I was still expecting to be summoned so<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to engage the giant and goblins, just pull<br/>
them off the others so they&#39;d have time to run/gate/whatever.  <br/>
So every new goblin that came in I&#39;d rush to attack, which<br/>
slowly led me to the king room.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know what to do.  Like Crier, I had never considered<br/>
the possibility of me living while everyone else died.  I<br/>
figured Vox was impossible in our current state, especially<br/>
with the priest there (remember, living was completely new to<br/>
me so it didn&#39;t occur to me until later that all these casters<br/>
were coming in full mana :).  I kept attacking goblins that<br/>
were being pulled in, which brought me to the flag room.  <br/>
There, someone with a giant on them ran past me (I was walking<br/>
the entire time :), and the giant latched on to me.  So I<br/>
shouted &quot;giant to zone&quot; and walk/jumped to the zone.  Somehow<br/>
I made it.<br/>
<br/>
So we started off fighting Vox alone, but ended up fighting a<br/>
bunch of other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, bards make pretty good tanks with 2260 hp.  Don&#39;t think <br/>
I could&#39;ve tanked Vox alone though.  :)<br/>
