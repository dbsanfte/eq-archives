<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118950624">What do you want to bet the other Singing Steel Pieces are not in the game<br/>
because they ran out of ideas for effects to give them?<br/>
<br/>
Too bad the rumour that all the melee and hybrid BP&#39;s had Gate, I was<br/>
looking forward to that.  I&#39;ve been playing my bard a whole lot more lately<br/>
and having fun, but there are still times when I play my casters solely due<br/>
to the inconveniences of being a melee class. ;-(<br/>
<br/>
What effects do you think would be good for us?  I know no one can be too<br/>
thrilled about the Summon Food and Water.  What could we get that would be<br/>
better used, seem like most of the other classes get truly useful effects so<br/>
far for the most part.<br/>
