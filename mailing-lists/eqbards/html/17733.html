<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001839404">Yep, and you were right John.  Even in the last three pickup groups I was<br/>
in, the same rules prevailed.  All three of those groups were mainly people<br/>
who grouped together and had added a couple of &quot;Irregulars&quot;.  Even their own<br/>
bard wasn&#39;t very happy with the idea, especially since one of the items was<br/>
a slight upgrade for the guy that got it, but he couldn&#39;t pass on the<br/>
replaced item because it wasn&#39;t usable by bards.<br/>

&gt; I think this has become typical.  Because there are very few items that<br/>
&gt; truly scream Bard, I get to be second or third on every list.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, second and third never come up.  I have despaired of<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; any rare items without soloing the mobs that carry them.  Every group I&#39;m<br/>
in<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already stated this.  If you&#39;re being demoted to second<br/>
or third on certain items because other classes can use it<br/>
better, then make your friends aware that there are no items<br/>
that bards can use best (other than a couple instruments) and<br/>
ask to be promoted to first on other items to compensate.<br/>
