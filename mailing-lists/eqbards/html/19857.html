<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Song (parody): Closet Male <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411973399">Heh, all the time.  Half-elves are far and away the most popular, but any<br/>
of<br/>
  the elven races, Erudites, and Humans have their admirers.<br/>
<br/>
  - I love the half-elf male bards :)  The nice clean shaven face.... My<br/>
what a nice set of pixels you have ;)  I also like the blonde barbarian.....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; Jacana, Wood Elf Bard of the 17th song, Innoruuk<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  - *in her best eeyor voice* &quot;Thanks for noticing&quot;<br/>
   Oh yea thanks to Kuark and a few hours tonight a bubble off 18 :)<br/>
<br/>
  the female player who made a male half-elf bard so that she could ogle him<br/>
without offending other players.  ;^)<br/>
<br/>
  - I would do that but it&#39;s more fun to have &quot;live bait&quot;.  Some days I have<br/>
WAY too much fun as a bard.  My guild and I have a joke about Jacana and her<br/>
&quot;horde of smitten followers&quot;.  They are everywhere ;)  I love bards!<br/>
<br/>
  Jacana , Wood Elf Bard, Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
  P.S. Did I mention how much I love bards?<br/>
