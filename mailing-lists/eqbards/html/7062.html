 </span></blockquote>I have all the time.  In Lower Guk, Sol B, and fighting shadowed men <br/>
outdoors I have been been able to interrupt casters.  At 33rd my current <br/>
weapon setup is Claw and Dirk, and in most battles I usually get atleast one <br/>
interrupt against casters.  In Cazic it is a different story as those <br/>
lizards cast so fast it is criminal.<br/>
