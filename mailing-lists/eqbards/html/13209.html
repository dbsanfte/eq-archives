<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The &quot;strategy&quot; is being fixed in an upcoming patch.  Basically, the <br/>
room spawns with the lord and 2 boks most of the time.  Necro <br/>
waltzes into the room, screaming terrors one bok, charms the other <br/>
bok, sic&#39;s it on the lord, and feigns death.  Lord kills bok, is <br/>
pretty hurt.  Other bok comes back.  Necro charms bok, sic&#39;s bok on <br/>
lord, feigns death.  Lord kills bok, has a sliver of health left.  <br/>
Necro, will full health and mana, stands up and kills lord easily.<br/>
<br/>
There you have it.<br/>
