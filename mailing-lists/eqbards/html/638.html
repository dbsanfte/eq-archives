<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231026661">Not finished it. Anyone know how tough that hermit is? Been asking people <br/>
but no one seems to know. I don&#39;t want to bug someone I don&#39;t know to go <br/>
there to /con him, so I&#39;m stuck with the memory of a lvl 16 guy I was with <br/>
once saying the hermit /conned red to him.<br/>
Speaking of that general area, what&#39;s up with Guard McCluskey? I want to <br/>
kill him, just cuz. Anybody done it? I think I might&#39;ve missed a crucial <br/>
moment the other day when I was wandering and passed through that those <br/>
houses near the canyon to Qeynos hills (where that Misty lady hangs out all <br/>
day) and I saw McCluskey walking away from Misty.<br/>
Now, whether they exchanged words or not I don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s probably <br/>
wishful thinking on my part (The most impressive (and I say that dubiously) <br/>
display of AI I&#39;ve seen was when the Brothers near there used to flame the <br/>
crap out of each other once in a while) but it could be cool to find out <br/>
more about those folks in such a way eh?<br/>

Just thought of this...<br/>
<br/>
Possible *SPOILER* for some:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone completed the quest from Valen Nostrolo in South Karana? He was<br/>
completing a song and needed two pages. It is possible that the reward <br/>
could be<br/>
one of the missing songs. I am not high enough level to complete the quest <br/>
yet,<br/>
so don&#39;t know what you get.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...<br/>
