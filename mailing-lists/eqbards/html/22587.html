<div id="ygrps-yiv-776883459">sweet, we got a pair of those shoes last night too.  speaking of drops =)<br/>
silly me, i went ahead and used some points on a Dragon Claw Main Gauche off<br/>
SW (2 dropped, only myself and a ranger wanted them).  i am very low on<br/>
points after getting my SSS, so i just wanted something from VP just<br/>
because, ya know to have SOMETHING hehe, not that this sword ain&#39;t nice.<br/>
so then next thing i know Hosh comes along and i use some more points on a<br/>
Veldrak&#39;s Shortblade! (no one wanted it)  now i don&#39;t know which to use!<br/>
(have to keep SSS in primary hand).  ya i know i got it rough =p<br/>
<br/>
SW drops a nice hammer for ya Halana, good luck in there.<br/>
