&gt; &gt; You go up against Cain, you expect to be dead. You try to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The fact that Cazic Thule is killable (without casualties even<br/>
&gt; - happened on my server) contradicts this notion.  If a<br/>
&gt; well-coordinated group can take out Cazic while suffering<br/>
&gt; minimal casualties, then giving him a death touch is a<br/>
&gt; cop-out.  You couldn&#39;t make him buff or smart enough to kill<br/>
&gt; players, so you made him do it automatically.<br/>

consider the Dracoliche much harder to take down than Cazic. The hard<br/>
part is the clearing of the zone to get to Cazic, actually killing him<br/>
is a bit anti-climactic.<br/>

&gt; Think for a moment.  If CT *really* had a death touch, what<br/>
&gt; would he do the moment he discovered mortals were messing<br/>
&gt; around in his realm?  DT all of them.  Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>
&gt; do if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>
&gt; game, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>
&gt; super-powers.<br/>
