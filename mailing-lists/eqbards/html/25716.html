<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146333623">Good quest -- easier and harder than you might think.  If you have a good guild that raids a bit, look to hit City of Mist, Kaesora and get a good group together to hunt scorpikus&#39;s in the canyon in the Overthere (beware the harm touch) --<br/>
Otherwise you can buy these coins for varying amounts.  I have seen the Kaesora coin auctioned for up to 400pp -- too much IMHO but it is probably the hardest to come by.  <br/>
If you are going to buy the coins though -- a walrus skin drum goes for 1K on Rodcet Nife and probably similar amounts elsewhere.  It is a better drum and if you have the cash on hand, takes a lot less time to get )<br/>
Best of Luck<br/>
