make yourself invisible?  If you&#39;re bound in an evil city,<br/>
going to the bank to pick up a spare isn&#39;t an option.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I accidently entered Neriak when I was level 16.  I actually<br/>
didn&#39;t have any trouble getting into the city because I<br/>
entered the cave from the top.  Just inside the city didn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be a problem.  I zoned back out, and was immediately<br/>
jumped by two red guards.  Mind you, I had Accelerando with a<br/>
drum running just before I zoned, and I restarted it<br/>
immediately upon exiting.  Being server AI-driven, they were<br/>
easily able to keep up with me and whack me from behind while<br/>
I navigated the twists and turns that are at every zone point.<br/>
When I finally got out of the cave, a third guard jumped into<br/>
the fray.  I managed to get away from them and zone into EC<br/>
with two bubbles of life.  This was with my drum and all my<br/>
banded armor.  Without my equipment I most likely would&#39;ve<br/>
died.<br/>

A monk on the eq_monk list used to be a big advocate of what<br/>
you suggest - binding in Grobb (or whatever the troll city is)<br/>
for fighting in Guk and Innotule.  He&#39;d use sneak (it works<br/>
better for monks) to get past the guards outside the zone.<br/>
Then one day, Verant caught on that this was going on, and<br/>
added a wandering guard just inside the zone.  He lost almost<br/>
a full level from being killed over and over just as he<br/>
respawned, until he finally managed to zone out.<br/>
<br/>
None of the strategies you suggest are viable at low levels<br/>
because you just don&#39;t have enough hit points to take the hits<br/>
from the guards should they attack you.  At high levels it&#39;s a<br/>
moot point because a cleric can revive/resurrect you.<br/>
<br/>
When you die you typically lose about an hour&#39;s worth of<br/>
experience.  Running the extra 4 zones takes about 10 minutes<br/>
for a bard (I&#39;ve timed it - with Accelerando and a drum, most<br/>
zones take from just under a minute to about two minutes to<br/>
cross in your mid 20s, W and S Karana and the ramp to Highpass<br/>
in EK being the exceptions).  That means even if you&#39;re<br/>
re-killed only 1 time in 5 doing the bind-in-an-evil-city<br/>
trick, you&#39;re worse off than if you&#39;d bound in a safe city and<br/>
made the full run every time.  The numbers are different for<br/>
all the other non-binding classes since they can&#39;t run as<br/>
fast, but that also means they&#39;re at more risk of re-death<br/>
since they can&#39;t outrun the guards.<br/>
<br/>
I really wouldn&#39;t recommend you do this.<br/>
