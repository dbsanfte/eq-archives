<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797839518">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I decided to test the pulse effect over the weekend.<br/>
The two songs I looked at are Chrods of Dissonance, Hymn of <br/>
Restoration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My Bard is just 11th Level. There is a possibility that these tests <br/>
were conducted when my Bard was 10th, I went 10th -&gt; 11th -<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;10th-&gt;11th a lot(it sucked).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Starting with Hymn:<br/>
This was easy to test. Go out a fight a mob so you lose hit Points. <br/>
Once the mob is killed start the healing song, wait for the message <br/>
you wounds begin to heal, then start any other song, switch to you <br/>
stats and you will get another 2 pulses of healing effect.<br/>
<br/>
This was only tested using a lute.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now Chords :<br/>
For this I needed a friend to duel with. Thanks goes to Grak the <br/>
Troll that feels no pain  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I tested this first with a lute. I asked Grak to look at his hits and <br/>
any time they drop type x. I started up Chords and as soon as I got <br/>
the &quot;Grak winces&quot; message I started another song.<br/>
<br/>
Grak typed<br/>
x<br/>
x<br/>
x<br/>
<br/>
The first 2 x&#39;s did 7 damage, the last one I think did 7 but may have <br/>
done 1/2 of 7.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now without a lute, Grak typed<br/>
x<br/>
x<br/>
The first x did 6 damage, the second did 3 damage. Interesting?<br/>
<br/>
Next what I want to look at is when do the pulse songs become <br/>
active. Normally when juggling I wait for the wince, heal message <br/>
before changing to another song. I wonder if the song becomes <br/>
active for 1 pulse if you change before the message.<br/>
