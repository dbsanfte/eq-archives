<b>Subject:</b> Re: NPC&#39;s Binding <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389151475"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; In the case of Bind Affinity, there&#39;s more than enough bind capable players<br/>
&gt; online on any server at any time to accommodate player needs.  The only time<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not true. Quite frequently at off hours (400-700 people online)<br/>
I&#39;ll be running back to my group after selling loot (as my other char,<br/>
a druid) and cross through several zones with people repeatedly asking for<br/>
binds and not getting any responses. Sometimes I&#39;ll return an hour later<br/>
if the loot has been plentiful (heavy) and I&#39;ll hear them still shout&#39;ing<br/>
for a bind. In that situation I&#39;ll spot and bind them, even though most of<br/>
the time my group needs me back ASAP (I go because I&#39;m the fastest).<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention, I have a number of lower level friends who I have to give<br/>
group teleports semi-regularly (every night or two) because they died and<br/>
they weren&#39;t able to get bound. If someone has to spend half an hour,<br/>
putting their fun and adventuring on hold, just to PAY someone to bind<br/>
them, then something is very very wrong in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is still a strong balancing factor.  Synergy.  Interaction.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Frustration. Anger. Why should people spread out, if they&#39;re punished for<br/>
it?<br/>
