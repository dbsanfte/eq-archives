 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a wood elf.  Those were the prices at the armor seller in the wood elf <br/>
city.  (AFTER I bought it, I realized that it was size Medium rather than <br/>
size Small, so I lost about 250 plat selling it back again. OUCH!  I <br/>
finally found the size Small one in the Dwarf city.)<br/>

I&#39;ve been fighting in Cazic lately.  According to some posts on the EQVault <br/>
bug board, Cazic resets all your faction ratings to their default values. <br/>
 If this is true, then it would account for some price differences.<br/>
