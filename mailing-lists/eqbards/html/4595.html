&gt; &gt; You want stats that improve as you<br/>

&gt; &gt; starting level 1 when you&#39;re at your peak,<br/>

&gt; That depends on your view of realism. If you believe that you start out &quot;at<br/>
&gt; your peak&quot; then it would be all downhill from there, which makes no sense<br/>

balanced, if they did do what you suggest, more likely you&#39;d<br/>
start off with *lower* stats that you do now, and gradually<br/>
work up to what we start with now as &quot;prime.&quot;<br/>
