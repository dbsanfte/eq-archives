<b>Subject:</b> Hunting the new Hate - Minor Spoiler! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-722667507">First off, I will not say that any of this is proven to be the <br/>
best... I will not say any of this is required. What I *WILL* say is <br/>
that my guild has been in Hate every night (except the very first) <br/>
since the new Hate has been release and this is how we have lived and <br/>
hunted most of the zone.<br/>
<br/>
1) We have broken in from SWC and NEC.<br/>
2) When you travel from gate in, do NOT go above half way up the <br/>
wall. You *WILL* aggo level 2 MOBs.<br/>
3) Same as usual, if you aggro on your way to SWC or NEC, either kill <br/>
the MOB and camp/come back, or die.<br/>
4) When you get to SWC or NEC, camp and come right back. <br/>
5) If you log for a bit, you can log on the floor in SWC or at the <br/>
top of the ramp. (yep, actually pretty safe.)<br/>
6) You must clear most of first floor before hunting second -- you <br/>
can aggro MOBs from 1 while on 2, and I can tell you there are few <br/>
things as annoying as fighting a level 2 MOB with a cleric on floor 1 <br/>
casting CH. *Smiles* You can also aggro MOBs on 1 so that they <br/>
actually TP to 2 and join in on the fun.<br/>
7) If you are fluxed while fighting on 1, camp and come back. If you <br/>
are in a group with a bard, the whole group camps and comes back.<br/>
8) Anytime you have level 2 aggro on 1, camp and come back. I was <br/>
actually punch killed in NEC from a level 2 MOB before I could get <br/>
out.<br/>
9) Once you start on level 2, the MOBs have almost no aggro range. <br/>
You practically have to hug them to get them aggro. *Smiles* Pull <br/>
group is also different on 2. We have been using a warrior and a <br/>
druid. Pathing is BAD, so keep the puller close to the MOB, and keep <br/>
the MOB snared (if it takes a bad path, it does not run too far.)<br/>
10) Don&#39;t touch the flames on level 2 (big blue fire.) This will take <br/>
you back to gate in, and will allow you to make some new &quot;friends&quot;. <br/>
*Smiles*<br/>
11) Speaking of the flames, there is a nice open area across from <br/>
them with almost no roamers. This is a good place to which to pull.<br/>
12) The loot items are pretty nice. We have found the new BP, helm, <br/>
bracers,  and boots(???) for rangers, a monk only ring (+3 all stats <br/>
and saves?), a 27/29 (or close) paladin sword, etc...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be well and Safe,<br/>
