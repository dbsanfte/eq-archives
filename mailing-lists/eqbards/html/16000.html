<div id="ygrps-yiv-395864704">I agree there are problems with AC as well.  However I tend to solo, a LOT<br/>
and in EQ that&#39;s pretty much stopped me cold (unless I wanna play a<br/>
nerfomancer or a druid - which I dont).<br/>
<br/>
The thing I like best about AC is that I *Can* solo whenever I like.  If I&#39;m<br/>
in a grouping mood and my friends are online (I generally play AC while I<br/>
wait for the normal time we play then switch) I log into EQ.  If they&#39;re not<br/>
online or I just want to solo I play AC.<br/>
<br/>
I too would LOVE to see a blend of these two games.  They&#39;re both fantastic<br/>
and if a company took the strengths of both they&#39;d steal everyone&#39;s<br/>
customers fast.<br/>
<br/>
AC - Size, scope, skill system, scenery graphics, friendly CS staff,<br/>
in-depth notes on any changes made<br/>
EQ - Character/NPC graphics, interface, communications<br/>
<br/>
Wish I worked for a game company ;)<br/>

&gt; Archers aren&#39;t really all that over-powered.  I play a &quot;Ranger&quot; that I<br/>
&gt; created.  He&#39;s specialized in archery & axe.  I find myself using the axe<br/>
&gt; FAR more often in dungeons and the bow more often on the surface.  Archers<br/>
&gt; are supposed to be powerful in open areas where they can peg you from 300<br/>
&gt; yards.  Underground the tanks rule.<br/>
&gt; ------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I played AC for 4 mos.  In that time, I got a Sho melee sword fighter with<br/>
&gt; creature and item 4 to level 30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Things I liked about AC:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -Totally customizable characters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -The GM staff and Turbine are not paranoid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -Camping is almost not an issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -You can get experience off of anything you kill, albeit less the higher<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; go if the critter is low level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -The death penalty doesnt hurt as much as EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -The ability to solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Things I didn&#39;t like about AC:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -The interface<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -The chat system<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -The posing for combat (got my mage killed plenty).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -The graphics<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In addition, the game is becoming more crowded.  The higher in level you<br/>
go,<br/>
&gt; the more difficult it becomes to find places to hunt that will give you<br/>
&gt; decent experience. (sound familiar?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mages and archers are very powerful.  I&#39;ve had an archer 5 levels below me<br/>
&gt; out kill me in dungeons using the quarrel bug, which has been in existence<br/>
&gt; since beta.  They can&#39;t take the hits that a melee fighter can, so they<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; stand back and let you tank while they suck up the experience.  Since<br/>
&gt; everyone who touches a monster gets experience from it, there is no &quot;kill<br/>
&gt; stealing&quot; per se.  Your only recourse is to leave him to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I decided to leave AC and return to EQ, my patriarch, our monarch<br/>
&gt; (level 40 archer), and some other vassels in the allegiance all came with<br/>
&gt; me.  So far, they like it better than AC.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t to say I totally hate AC, or that I don&#39;t see the problems EQ<br/>
&gt; has, just, for me, EQ has more depth to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I too, would like to see a nice hybrid of the best of the MORPG&#39;s I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; played. Done right, it could be an awesome game.<br/>
