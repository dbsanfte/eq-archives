<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531628228">Quest originates with a NPC merchant who hangs out _behind_ the druid guild<br/>
hall in Kelethin (Soldiers of Tunare).  The quest is pretty easy, if you&#39;re<br/>
in your upper 20s, or have a group.  He&#39;ll tell you that he needs the<br/>
&#39;plans&#39; and 3 bars of enchanted gold and he&#39;ll make you the weapon.  The<br/>
gold bars are easy... usually plenty of enchanters willing to help out near<br/>
Kelethin.  The SG can be a pain in the arse - primarily due to his highly<br/>
erratic spawn times (anywhere from many hours to minutes).  The Kilij is a<br/>
magic 1H slash, non-lore, Bard-Warrior-Rogue only weapon.  It&#39;s 10 DMG and<br/>
35 Delay.  All in all, it&#39;s a good weapon - but it&#39;s very heavy, so if you<br/>
use it in your primary hand, expect to take a big hit to stamina.<br/>
<br/>
Also... this weapon appears to be only useful to a bard - quite frankly, I<br/>
don&#39;t understand why they included Warriors and Rogues.  At the level that a<br/>
warrior could take the SG, he&#39;s probably already got a far superior 2H<br/>
weapon.  Since it&#39;s not piercing it&#39;s practically useless for a rogue.<br/>

BTW, what is the Brazen Brass Kilij.  I have never heard of it before.  What<br/>
are the stats? What drops it? Which zone? What skill?<br/>
