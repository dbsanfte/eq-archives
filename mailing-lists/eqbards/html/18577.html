<div id="ygrps-yiv-87710968">No apology needed Kenross :) I was always of the opinion that this <br/>
game should be fun.  I always, always tell my guildmembers if they <br/>
aren&#39;t having fun in the guild, they should move on.  If their idea <br/>
of fun meant being able to do a plane or a dragon, then Legends was <br/>
not the guild for them since we could not muster the resources <br/>
required to do such an event.  Yes, this places the guild into a <br/>
vicious cycle and makes it tough to ever get powerful enough to do <br/>
things as a guild, but I have always believed in a guild as a means <br/>
to an end.  The end being more fun for each individual member.  As <br/>
long as the guild provides the fun for a person on an individual <br/>
basis, great!  However, if the guild is not satisfying an individual, <br/>
then it&#39;s great they can find a way to have fun with someone else.  <br/>
One way of looking at it is to not think of it as losing a <br/>
guildmember, rather think of it as gaining an ambassador within <br/>
another guild.  I have found the people who have left Legends on good <br/>
terms are still Legends at heart and usually continue to benefit <br/>
Legends in some way at some point. <br/>

itself.  My first guild on Innoruuk (The Talquinn) had this problem <br/>
for a few months.  Every other high level who got to 50 left, <br/>
generally because we weren&#39;t big enough to do the dragons/planes <br/>
stuff.  So we ended up merging with two and a half other guilds <br/>
(Crimson Sigil, Order of the Black Staff, and about half of Legends - <br/>
sorry, Rosha).  I&#39;d say that, in our ability to get stuff done, we&#39;re <br/>
in the top four now.  We asked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone to remove himself from the guild last night, though, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>because he was clearly courting the #1 guild.  It is kind of annoying <br/>
to be a training ground for higher level guilds, particularly when <br/>
they do not show any courtesy or respect when dealing with you <br/>
normally.<br/>

orginal members of a guild on Innoruuk called &quot;Higher Arts of Arcane&quot; <br/>
(sp)   I left that guild in a heart beat when it came time to group <br/>
and &quot;guild members&quot; come first!  though I played with the party more <br/>
than 3 weeks straight and got bumped because of guild rules!  Now, <br/>
instead of bitching about the guild rules, I dropped the guild I was <br/>
in and joined all my friends guild.  Immediately I got things that I <br/>
have been struggling to get.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>

was quickly solved after I took anonymous off and he was nearly 20 <br/>
lvls below me.<br/>
