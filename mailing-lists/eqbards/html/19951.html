 </span></blockquote>Nope they don&#39;t make backups regularly.  But they&#39;ve had to do quick<br/>
rollbacks before.  If you haven&#39;t played regularly on test and don&#39;t know<br/>
the environment please don&#39;t make blatant generalizations.  Typically the<br/>
backups are about 2 weeks old.  When they did this restore characters that<br/>
were deleted 2-3 months ago were re-created.<br/>

Uhh thanks so much for your ignorance of the situation..  We are players.<br/>
We pay $10 per month just like you.  The players who played there and got to<br/>
high levels SPECIFICALLY so that they could test high level<br/>
dungeons/areas/planes/dragons were basically paying verant for the<br/>
priveledge of doing their jobs for them.  People that played on test<br/>
religiously (I&#39;m not talking about the 5 day wonders that would level to<br/>
17th then go back to a live server) were very religious testers.  Most of us<br/>
have been testing this game since Beta 2 or earlier.  Many of those folks<br/>
have now left in disgust over their treatment by Verant.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO:  Anyone who played on Test should have been playing for free instead<br/>
of paying $10 bucks a month.  Just my opinion though.<br/>
<br/>
I leave you with this thought:<br/>
If there weren&#39;t level 50 players to test the planes, dragons, kunark,<br/>
etc... how stable would those zones be on the live servers?  Hope you enjoy<br/>
falling through the world for 32,000 dmg when walking across the plane of<br/>
hate.  I&#39;ve had it happen.  Have you?</div>
