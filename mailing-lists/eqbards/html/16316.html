<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589613613">The problem I was addressing mainly was that due to the limitations I play<br/>
under as a casual player, I can only play long enough to see some named<br/>
spawns spawn twice about once every two weeks.  If the spawn is more than 45<br/>
minutes apart, letting my group share any night at every other spawn means<br/>
we&#39;ll generally get one shot at the named spawn.  The rest of the two weeks<br/>
or so in between these meetings the people who get on and want to do<br/>
something else must leave and travel elsewhere.  It isn&#39;t worthwhile to<br/>
travel for 45+ minutes to get to a spawn site to play for 2 hours to fight<br/>
the spawn once, then have to do the whole thing again a week or two later.<br/>
As we have worked things out before we only do named spawns when we can set<br/>
up a time in advance and get a group member to get there early to get on the<br/>
list if there is one so we can all get to hunt the spawn&#39;s area for 2 hours<br/>
or so and see the spawn 3-4 times.  Under this system we will only rarely be<br/>
able to fight the spawn once, rarely twice.  This pretty much locks us out<br/>
of any chance of ever getting rare drops.  We can only play with enough of<br/>
us to do tough camps once every other week pretty much anyhow.  Giving us<br/>
the ability to get a chance at the spawn every nite while reducing our<br/>
ability to camp the spawn longer gains us exactly zero access, while<br/>
reducing the access we did have.  None of my regular groupmates plays more<br/>
than 4 times a week and those are the ones who can solo easily.  Once a week<br/>
is the most often we get more than three guildmembers together.  From our<br/>
experience the new rules will not increase our access as casual players, but<br/>
exactly the opposite.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d be tempted to agree with that, but their are several places where it<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; ridiculous for a group to go in and sit and do nothing for hours while<br/>
&gt; waiting for one spawn because there are only two and another group has<br/>
&gt; demanded you let them have the other one.  The group who can play for<br/>
hours<br/>

I have a hard time understanding what you&#39;re saying here.  <br/>
It&#39;s worth it to sit there for hours hoping for two named<br/>
spawns, but not worth it to sit there for one?  What about all<br/>
the spots where there is only a single named spawn?  Are these<br/>
spots simply not worth your time no matter what?<br/>
<br/>
The MO I&#39;ve seen nearly everywhere is to camp one named mob<br/>
site, while pulling generic mobs from other locations.  The<br/>
only 2-named-mob sites that come to mind are the<br/>
assassin/supplier, and the king room in permafrost.  Maybe the<br/>
maid/butler room in Mistmoore.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; still gets the benefit as they are going to be there for hours anyhow,<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; group gets their limited playing time suddenly made nearly pointless while<br/>
&gt; had the group that&#39;s going to be on for 6 hours simply let you have their<br/>
&gt; two hours they would miss only 1/3 rd of their available time, you are<br/>
&gt; forced to lose half your time which may well make the room unviable for<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re still not looking at the big picture.  Yes you might<br/>
lose half your time this time.  But instead of having to wait<br/>
2 weeks before getting another crack at it, you can go back<br/>
tomorrow, no waiting (well, aside from the waiting for the<br/>
named mob to show).<br/>
<br/>
This rule does not change the crowding, does not change the<br/>
mob spawn rate, does not change the item drop rate.  It only<br/>
changes the composition and number of the people camping those<br/>
mobs.  If it results in casual players having easier access to<br/>
oft-camped mobs, then it improves their chances of getting<br/>
items from that mob.  If the mob still remains camped to the<br/>
point where casual players are discouraged, then it is<br/>
*already* camped to the point where casual players are<br/>
discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Result is you move on to find something you can actually enjoy your two<br/>
&gt; hours at and the long termers get the whole room anyhow for the full time.<br/>
&gt; Eventually the short timers will find everything shared and will quit in<br/>
&gt; frustration as they never get a turn at getting a useful chance to do a<br/>
room<br/>
&gt; instead getting many turns that are not very useful.<br/>
<br/>
Define &quot;useful chance&quot; and &quot;not very useful.&quot;  If you normally<br/>
only had a shot at a named spawn once every 2 weeks, and under<br/>
the new rules if every named spawn has an average of 2 groups<br/>
(highly unlikely as I don&#39;t think there are that many players<br/>
despite the overcrowding); then your shot at getting a night<br/>
at the named spawn has gone from 1 in 14 days to an effective<br/>
1 in 2 days.  If you normally had a shot at a named spawn<br/>
point once every 2 days, then it&#39;s not camped to the point<br/>
where it&#39;ll be a problem under the old or the new rules.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why so many people are so vehemently<br/>
opposed to the concept of sharing.  When I first started the<br/>
game, that&#39;s how I played.  Share the derv camp, share the orc<br/>
camp.  I only went along with the camper-has-all-rights rule<br/>
because that seemed to be the majority consensus.  And even<br/>
then, if I was group leader and holding a spot with multiple<br/>
named mobs in a crowded zone when another group came looking,<br/>
I gave them the extra.<br/>
<br/>
I really think this is one of those prisoner&#39;s dilemma<br/>
situations, where the bad choice from an individual<br/>
cost/benefit analysis results in the best outcome for everyone<br/>
overall (and the good choice from an individual cost/benefit<br/>
analysis results in the worst outcome for everyone overall).<br/>
