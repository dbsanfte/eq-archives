<div id="ygrps-yiv-700293352">You can always cast the 15th level sleep song, it seems to cause the mob to<br/>
forget who it is most mad at.<br/>
<br/>
This I have confirmed on many occasions, our mage character will cast a high<br/>
damage spell, and suddenly he is public enemy #1, I&#39;ll sing my song, walk up<br/>
and hit the monster in the back for 2 pts of damage, and suddenly it hates<br/>
me, because it thinks I have done the most damage, as long as I keep singing<br/>
the song, the mob only attacks who ever attacked it last, this causes damage<br/>
to be delivered evenly to the whole party, so less down time for healing.<br/>
<br/>
Now unfortunately, if the mob resists the song, which blues occasionally do,<br/>
then it works like taunt, the mob will generally be pissed at you, and only<br/>
you, until it fails to resist again, then back to spin the mob.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I thought this was supposed to be an area effect Cancel Magic spell, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t keep the casters from casting, but I thought that it would<br/>
&gt; remove<br/>
&gt; &gt; what ever effects that your party had had cast on them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nope, it&#39;s not a party protect song, it is an aggressive song that<br/>
&gt; effects mobs. It just doesnt appear to do anything. I think the<br/>
&gt; Disenchanting Melody is supposed to do what you suggest, but my testing<br/>
&gt; with it suggested it didn&#39;t do anything either. Maybe it only breaks<br/>
&gt; enchantments like charm. It doesn&#39;t break root, I know that from<br/>
&gt; testing. And with only 6 spell slots available, I&#39;ve found it more<br/>
&gt; useful to keep charm memorized. If one of your party get&#39;s charmed,<br/>
&gt; charm them back. Charm can also be useful in those rare places where the<br/>
&gt; Bard is not automatically at the top of every mob&#39;s hate list. There,<br/>
&gt; the cleric seems to top the list after casting the first heal, and<br/>
&gt; nothing I could do would distract a mob from beating on him, except<br/>
&gt; charm. And once the charm wears off you can be sure you are on top of<br/>
&gt; the mob&#39;s hate list. <br/>
