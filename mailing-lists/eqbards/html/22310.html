<div id="ygrps-yiv-303320922">I&#39;m in East Karana farming silks of off the crag spiders. I find a hill <br/>
giant roaming around and for kicks charm him and he&#39;s killing spiders for <br/>
me. After all the spiders are clear, I bring him over to kill Broon. Nobody <br/>
else has been hunting him and there&#39;s few people in the zone anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My pet kills Broon, then Droon pretty easily. I decide I&#39;m bored with the <br/>
hill giant and start Dot&#39;ing him to death, when I spy an evil eye through <br/>
the rain. I can also make out a shield by the EE, so I figure he must have <br/>
summoned a pet as well. My pet still has about 1.5 bubbles, so I charm him <br/>
and send him in to kill the EE. I&#39;ve been killed by EE&#39;s in the past, so <br/>
I&#39;m thinking revenge<br/>
<br/>
I swoop by just to make sure nobody is fighting him, and I think I see a <br/>
player there, but it turns out to be an NPC as I target him when I click my <br/>
&quot;target nearest NPC&quot;. Never heard of this NPC in the zone, but he&#39;s green <br/>
to me, so no worries. I&#39;ll just kill the EE.<br/>
<br/>
My giant goes in and stomps the eye to death. I recharm him and he goes <br/>
running back through the fog to finish off the EE&#39;s pet, I&#39;m sure. <br/>
Afterwards, I DOT the HG to death and go in to check out the corpses.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the corpse of an evil eye, and there&#39;s the corpse of the npc, but <br/>
it has a guild tag after the name. ACK! I do a quick &quot;/who all&quot; and send a <br/>
tell to the player, &quot;I&#39;m sooo sorry!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s saying, &quot;Oh no problem, the evil eye had me charmed and had me fight a <br/>
hill giant.&quot; I sadly explain that the hill giant was my pet and I had sent <br/>
him in to kill the Evil Eye. To his credit, he was very cordial and told me <br/>
not to worry about it. He turns out to be a level 18 bard who accidentally <br/>
ran into the Eye. Ack! I killed a fellow minstrel!<br/>
<br/>
I offered him the lambent stone that dropped on the hill giant and also <br/>
gave him a lumberjack cap that I still had in my bags and though he said I <br/>
didn&#39;t need to do that, I&#39;m glad he finally accepted them.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know to check a little closer to any pets an evil eye may have. :-)<br/>
