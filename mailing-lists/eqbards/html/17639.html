 </span></blockquote>woohoo! that is actually the goal :o) The Enchanter can&#39;t cast Sneeze<br/>
without the mob making a bee-line to her. So we are hoping that between Hymn<br/>
and Largo&#39;s I will start being the first choice. Which is pretty funny,<br/>
because in her last incarnation as a Warrior her entire Taunt-cycle was<br/>
spent trying to keep the mobs off ME.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
