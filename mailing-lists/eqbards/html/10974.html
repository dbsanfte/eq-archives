<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517452971">This was reported to the list yesterday mornin - after the patch.<br/>
<br/>
Veeshan went down last night - and there happened to be GMs in channel - so<br/>
take this for what&#39;s it&#39;s work.<br/>
<br/>
Q: To GM - fippy    Bards levitate seems to only work for 3 tics after a<br/>
pulse, does not continue, and you have to land before it can be restarted.<br/>
Secret Nerf - or unintended bug.<br/>
<br/>
A: Unintended bug - it&#39;s amazing what can break.<br/>

&gt;Anyway, with the latest patch, I have noticed a problem with the level 31<br/>
 </span></blockquote>song, the levitate one.  Now when I play it, it starts, I rise, I get the<br/>
message I feel as if I am about to fall, followed by You are already<br/>
floating.  This repeats for 2 cycles.  Immediately after the 3rd cycle of<br/>
the song, I then fall to the ground, the icon disappears.  On the next<br/>
cycle, it all repeats.  It does this even if twisting, so it seems to me<br/>
that it now only allows continuos levitation for two song pulses.  I did<br/>
just acquire this song, so I don&#39;t profess to be an expert, however, it did<br/>
not function like this prior to the patch.  Just a word of caution using<br/>
this song now, and be on the lookout for other changes!!<br/>
