1.	In this case I imagine it was a stone that someone sold to the vendor. It<br/>
was not in the standard goods.<br/>
<br/>
2.	How long will it be there? Until it is sold or there is a server reboot.<br/>
It will still be there after the vendor dies.<br/>
<br/>
3.	A vendor has many more inventory slots than what is shown. One of the<br/>
Tailoring guides floating around (Look on Allakazam&#39;s site) gives a long<br/>
description and example of searching for an item in a vendor&#39;s inventory.<br/>
(Mostly focuses on buying the vendor out of ruined pelts but it can be<br/>
adapted for Morti Staves and the like.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

Well I learned something new today.  I was always under the impression that<br/>
lambent stones could only be acquired by killing a giant or griffon.  Never<br/>
knew you could buy them from NPCs.  Can someone list the known locations<br/>
where NPCs sell them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another thing.  I was wanting a stone the other night for my last piece of<br/>
&gt; Lambent.  The zone was camped and I couldn&#39;t find ONE giant, much less<br/>
&gt; two.<br/>
&gt; I /auc&#39;d for a stone and some jackass wanted 100pp.  I said &quot;Hey guy, I<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; buy one from the INN in Rathe Mts., a 60 second run, for 48pp.&quot;  He called<br/>
&gt; me a liar of course, so I ran to the Inn and bought it for 48pp.<br/>
