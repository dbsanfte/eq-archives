&gt;<br/>
&gt; Forgot to reply to this.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reliability is up...a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I built a couple of hundred pc&#39;s in the last year...<br/>
<br/>
Intel - about 1 in 250 doa<br/>
AMD - about 1 in 50<br/>
<br/>
Intel - none malfunctioned if it worked out of the box<br/>
AMD - about 1 in 30 malfunctioned sometime between out of the box and the<br/>
end of burn-in (72 hr running hot & heavy programs)<br/>
<br/>
Just my personal experience working in a pc shop...<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I&#39;ve heard great things about the new 1.3ghz AMD&#39;s...haven&#39;t actually<br/>
messed with one, but a friend of mine has built 10-15 machines from them,<br/>
and 10-15 intel p4 1.7ghz...He says the AMD&#39;s he&#39;s built are more stable,<br/>
and run as much as 30% faster than the same build as an intel p4, on EVERY<br/>
app, games, utilities, and business apps.  I&#39;m gonna get one soon and try<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; On the overclockers forum I frequent, I can recall no posts lamenting DOA<br/>
&gt; processors offhand...and these are people who share every step they take<br/>
&gt; when OC&#39;ing their machines.  :)  The 2 biggest processor killers on the<br/>
&gt; forum are heat casualties and crushed cores from trying to install<br/>
&gt; heatsinks.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is no real reason to not consider equally an AMD machine vs an Intel<br/>
&gt; machine, when shopping around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, more bang for the buck...consider also, any pc builder worth their salt<br/>
will have filtered the bad processors out before you ever get to see the<br/>
machines, i.e. doa rate and failure rate are gonna be much lower than the<br/>
builders.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And a bit more reliable (less out-of-the-box failures with Intel)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aye, Ive been an avid Intel fan, but do this still count? I know before K7<br/>
&gt; AMD had pretty lousy stability and QA. I havent heard about any problems<br/>
&gt; with k7 series though??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dunno, i quit the shop I was working at a little over a month ago, and<br/>
haven&#39;t messed with any since then, but the failure rate was still pretty<br/>
bad about 3 months ago.  More than I would trust, but AMD seems to be alot<br/>
better about warranty issues than Intel...you can get a replacement AMD<br/>
rather quickly (if you didn&#39;t nuke it w/ heat or crush it) while Intel<br/>
wanted to take a while and test the processor you sent back, etc.  (from an<br/>
OEM source...most of ya&#39;ll won&#39;t have that channel).<br/>
<br/>
My take on the whole issue is:<br/>
If you need a solid business machine, buy one from the big manufacturers,<br/>
i.e. Dell, Gateway, etc.  AMD/Intel<br/>
If you want a solid gaming machine, buy one from the big gaming<br/>
manufacturers, i.e. Falcon Northwest, Alienware, etc. AMD<br/>
If you don&#39;t mind dinking around, and possibly having some major downtime,<br/>
build it yourself. Intel before AMD<br/>
If you don&#39;t have the cash to invest in one of the big rigs, build it<br/>
yourself, but be ready for some pitfalls. AMD before Intel.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah...I have been real impressed with the 2 machines I&#39;ve seen from<br/>
Alienware...One a couple of years ago, was the fastest PII I had ever seen,<br/>
doing anything.  The latest and greatest my buddy has, AMD 1.3, top of the<br/>
line Alienware, absolutely smokes on any task you run on it...he dual boots<br/>
between win2k and win98se...and both os&#39;s tear up games.  (I have no<br/>
association to Alienware, don&#39;t even own one...but the next machine I buy<br/>
instead of build is gonna come from there...hmm...if I ever buy a machine<br/>
again...hehe)<br/>
