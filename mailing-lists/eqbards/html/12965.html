<b>Subject:</b> Re: Brad On Binding (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633981297">I myself find it hard to play in a regular group, my playing times vary<br/>
from week to week, usually depending on when my girlfriend is at work  =)<br/>
I work 9-5 and unless she is working when I am at home I cannot play (she<br/>
hates EQ). Therefore I am joining pickup groups and dieing more than I<br/>
probably would if I had a regular group.<br/>
<br/>
I find it annoying that we don&#39;t get bind affinity, mainly because we are<br/>
the weakest of all melee classes, however we are one of the bes classes at<br/>
agro&#39;ing mobs onto us, I think Verant should consider either giving bards<br/>
bind affinity OR, give us a song that allows us to Feing Death, monks are<br/>
very similar to bards, being weak (lack of AC & hp&#39;s), and they deal a hell<br/>
of a lotta dmg, so they tend to take alot of dmg, however they can just<br/>
feign death and they are fine, I rarely see a monk has been killed.<br/>
<br/>
Verant say that having melee&#39;ers bound outside a dungeon is unfair because<br/>
they can just get killed and zone back in and join in on the fight again,<br/>
this is not the case with bards, we have to mem songs (as we all know this<br/>
takes a good 5 minutes). And how are we gonna be any good unless we pick up<br/>
ALL of our equipment.<br/>
<br/>
I find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the Sol&#39;s I have to<br/>
run all the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to my corpse,<br/>
aswell as mem my songs and loose an hours worth of hard earned exp. To be<br/>
honest it is starting to **** me off and as I die about 5 times (at least)<br/>
every level this is wasting my valuable playing time, hence the reason I<br/>
have now started up a cleric, it&#39;s great, I get bind, gate etc and if I do<br/>
die, I&#39;ll only have to spend 20 seconds memming my spells. + at later<br/>
levels I&#39;ll be able to res myself  =)<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy playing my bard and have got to level 33 through alot of hard work,<br/>
I have great equipment for my level and am VERY keen to get to level 40+<br/>
but I jus can&#39;t see it happening, I don&#39;t know how you level 40+ bards on<br/>
this list do it.  I spoke to a level 50 bard on my server (Tegamen, I<br/>
think), he was wearing some imbrued and had some great equipment. So I<br/>
asked him if he had any tips on how to level fast, he replied &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot; I<br/>
said that I find it very hard not to die, he replied &quot;Trust me, Bards got<br/>
the bad deal&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Guess thats sums it all up then, I am still determined to reach level 50,<br/>
it&#39;ll just take me a few years  =)<br/>
