<div id="ygrps-yiv-499435651"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Friday at the start I hit 35. I played 16-20 hours a day in Lower Guk<br/>
&gt; fighting all sorts of nasties and hit 36 on Wednesday night. Truly hellish.<br/>
&gt; The good news, I did the same thing for the next few days and because of the<br/>
&gt; killing pace I had set for myself during 35 I went from 36 to 39 in less<br/>
&gt; than a week. Guess what, I am in 40 now and its worse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ouch, same thing happens to me. The only good thing about the hell levels<br/>
is they make the regular levels seem so damn fast. I worked so hard to<br/>
make it through 35 that I did 36/37/38/39 in a day each (with a one day<br/>
&#39;break&#39;). Now I&#39;m 40 also.. back to hell again.</div>
