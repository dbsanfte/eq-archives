&gt; Subject: Philosophy behind the Bard class<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is it just me or has anyone else noticed this?  It almost seems as if the<br/>
&gt; Bard class was designed with two distinct, and antagonistic philosophies<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tend to view the Jack-of-all-trade ability as benefitting a group more<br/>
than a &quot;self-sufficient, ultimate lone wolf mode&quot;.  The group doesn&#39;t have a<br/>
rogue, the bard can try to pick the lock (not that this ever happens).  No<br/>
Ranger or Druid, then the bard can track.  The group is caster heavy then<br/>
the bard can tank.  The group is melee heavy, the bard can be the<br/>
buffer/healer.  Then add in the utility songs, Selos, corpse locate, water<br/>
breathing and such.  It&#39;s all of this that make the bard a<br/>
Jack-of-all-trades.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On the other hand we have our spell abilities.  These are definitely<br/>
&gt; designed with bards as the ultimate party animals in mind.  Our magical<br/>
&gt; abilities magnify immensely with each member we add to our group, and are<br/>
&gt; underpowered at best if we are alone with some notable exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Bards songs do very well in a group environment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I don&#39;t equate Jack-of-all-trade as<br/>
self-sufficiency.  I view it more as an ability to fill different roles<br/>
depending on the makeup of the group.<br/>
