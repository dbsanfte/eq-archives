&gt; &gt;Anyone noticed almost every helm in the game is ugly? Definately every<br/>
&gt; &gt;plate helm is with the possible exception of the Trolls, which looks<br/>
&gt; &gt;vaguely ok.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love trolls&#39;, and barbarians&#39; plate helms. They should get a special rare<br/>
&gt; attack where they impale their victim&#39;s on their horns.<br/>
 <br/>
The barbarian helm looks like a hood ornament for a Texas Cadillac.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dwarven plate helms are good too, little spikey things.<br/>
<br/>
Great if you like looking like an extra at a bad opera.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I LOVE half-elven plate helms, they are very Flash Gordon. Very cool.<br/>
 <br/>
When I find my first laser pistol I will keep this in mind.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Wood elven males look great I think, I realize the little wings might not be<br/>
&gt; macho, but it is surely better than the girls.<br/>
<br/>
And if forage fails you can always roast up the bird that seems to have<br/>
hit you while you were speeding across the plains with Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dark elves of course has that hideous skull thing going, which although<br/>
&gt; ugly, I think looks GREAT and is very befitting of their class.<br/>
<br/>
And so useful on Halloween night.<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; Halflings and gnomes in plate end up looking like a little tin can, but<br/>
&gt; still neat looking.<br/>
<br/>
Just don&#39;t stand still too long or wood elves will start sticking the<br/>
fishing grubs they forage in the eye slots.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; Lowest ranking helm looks are humans, and wood elven girls. They both look<br/>
&gt; like a pencil eraser. Wood elven girls look like a trash can with Spock<br/>
&gt; ears. Just really bad. ;)<br/>
<br/>
You left out high elves. Two words. Batter up!<br/>
