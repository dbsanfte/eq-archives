<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-241184306">After this issue was brought up yesterday, I went to Unrest to do some<br/>
testing.  I&#39;m a 22d level bard with my Wind skill maxed out.  I started<br/>
singing the invisibility song and walked throughout Unrest conning<br/>
everything I saw.  In the yard, death beetles, jack-o-lanterns, and<br/>
tormented dead all conned indifferently to me.  Didn&#39;t get the chance to try<br/>
it against a greater skeleton though so don&#39;t know about them.  I can kill<br/>
them easily so not too concerned about them.  Inside on the 1st floor, every<br/>
ghoul I ran into conned indifferent.  I walked by a lesser mummy and it<br/>
attacked me so they are the first thing that saw through the invisibility.<br/>
Carrion ghouls conned ready to attack.  Didn&#39;t get the chance to test it<br/>
against dark and dry bone skeletons, werebats, or anything tougher.  If<br/>
anyone has confirmed successes against the tougher creatures then please<br/>
post it.  Specifically, if someone higher than 22d level can confirm that<br/>
the invisibility song works against carrion ghouls for them that would give<br/>
credence to the theory that the higher level you are has a direct<br/>
correlation on what mobs can see through the invisibility song.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; Mobs do change levels and acquire new skills if they raise high enough.<br/>
&gt; Also<br/>
&gt; it may have had spirit sight cast on it by another nearby mob. Aside from<br/>
&gt; this I know some Undead see invis just fine whil others not at all. I have<br/>
&gt; had Festering hags not see me if they are green to me, and then a blue one<br/>
&gt; sees me and scowls. I have walked all the way into the ghost room<br/>
&gt; unmolested<br/>
&gt; and other times a greater skel or hag will see me. In lower guk all the<br/>
&gt; ghouls see invis just fine, while in upper all that can see me is the<br/>
&gt; Warden<br/>
&gt; and the Lord. I never trust past experience with invis in any area I dont<br/>
&gt; know as gospel. Unrest is one of those places you never know whats going<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; happen next, I dont care how long you have played there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Almost every time I think something saw through my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;invisibility, I scroll back and the message immediately before<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I was attacked is &quot;you become visible.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hrm - there has always been some error with the cause and effect timing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Notice how whenever you are bashed, your song ends *before* the monster<br/>
&gt; &gt; bashes you?  Methinks that they hit you, removing the invisibility.  Now<br/>
&gt; &gt; how they saw you - well, who knows?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, unless you can explain how a mob that I&#39;d safely walked<br/>
&gt; through a dozen times before while invisible could suddenly<br/>
&gt; see me, I will go with the invisibility blinking off as the<br/>
&gt; explanation. :-)<br/>
