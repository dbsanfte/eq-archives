&gt;&gt;  Lately, I&#39;m having serious trouble finding a group. I&#39;m a level 10 bard on<br/>
&gt;&gt; Tarew Marr. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting in Steamfront Mountains. I&#39;m always<br/>
&gt;&gt; looking for a group to hunt mino&#39;s (great exp, and their axes sell for 4pp<br/>
&gt;&gt; to other players). Whenever I do a &quot;/ooc Level 10 Bard looking for a group&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I get no response. Even when there are other level 9-11 players in the area.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Are we bards no longer a valuable asset in a group? Has anyone experienced<br/>
&gt;&gt; this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>        Another possibility (and one I&#39;m most sure has already occurred to many<br/>
of you) is that most players just turn off the OOC. (I know I have.) Why?<br/>
Obnoxious fools flooding messages about the latest Phantom Menance<br/>
interpretation, questions on the best way to win at Might and Magic, general<br/>
chit-chat. Shout is bad enough but I can&#39;t turn THAT off without missing<br/>
someone needing REAL info (and not just a couple idiots shouting out to each<br/>
other because /tell is to difficult to do and to let all the others in the area<br/>
know how witty their repartee is).<br/>
        As much as I hate to say it, I have to promote a legitimate use of the<br/>
shout command. A characteristic shout for more members to hunt is a better use<br/>
than &quot;Hey! Elrandybabe! Was&#39; happening? I just got a bitchin sword of a gnoll!<br/>
You have some food and water on you?&quot;<br/>
        I&#39;ve also seen some successful grouping using the auction channel.<br/>
&quot;Mana-less healing and no-fail strength and SOW spells. Tell Toonles the bard<br/>
if interested in grouping with the best!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
        The point is most players have turned off the OOC. Everyone I know has.</div>
