<br/>
A lot of EQ players, for whatever reason, are not high enough level yet to<br/>
go on a dragon raid.  As it stands right now on most servers, you have to be<br/>
45+ to get invited on a dragon raid.  By the time you get to that level a<br/>
few months down the road, the expansion will likely be out.  Lets say in the<br/>
expansion Verant raises the level cap to 75.  So by the time us non 45+<br/>
people get to 45th level, the current level 50s will be fastly approaching<br/>
75.  You have to assume that a lot of these 75 people will still go on<br/>
dragon raids.  If it takes 24 level 45+ players now to kill a dragon, how<br/>
many level 75s will it take?  Once again you have to assume Verant will<br/>
upgrade the dragons because out of X people on a dragon raid, Y people<br/>
should die.  <br/>
<br/>
I think what Matt was implying is this is what he thinks will happen.  So<br/>
what does that mean for us currently below 45th level? By the time we get to<br/>
45th, people organizing raids will increase the minimum level to attend a<br/>
dragon raid raid, i.e. new minimum level is 55th.  End result is now that we<br/>
are 45th level, we&#39;re still to low to go on a dragon raid.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the best way Verant can solve this problem for those of us currently<br/>
not high enough to go on a dragon raid (if they even consider it a problem),<br/>
is that once the expansion comes out, put a maximum level limit to zone into<br/>
Permafrost or Sol B.  Kind of like a reverse Plane level limit.  If they<br/>
limit entering those zones to level 50s and below , then they don&#39;t have to<br/>
worry about level 75s coming in and easily killing a dragon.  They also<br/>
don&#39;t have to worry about continually making dragons tougher.<br/>

&gt; Seriously,  do what I do when you see posts that disturb you: delete them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right now, you have a lot of monsters to fight that are close to your<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
&gt; Deal with them now.  Play the game &#39;one level at a time&#39; and enjoy.  There<br/>
&gt; is nothing to be gained by worrying about stuff that is far away and<br/>
&gt; unknown.  The dragon&#39;s you fight will be different from the ones that we<br/>
&gt; fight today just as they are different from the first ones that were<br/>
&gt; fought<br/>
&gt; on all of the servers.  By the time you get there, there will be new<br/>
&gt; weapons, new spells and a history of tips, tricks, and tales from those<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; have gone before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Verant _knows_ that they are in the entertainment business.  My take is<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; they _will_ keep &quot;raising the bar&quot; on certain zones/monsters to prevent<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; from being &quot;farmed&quot; and provide challenge to the high levels.  Sometimes<br/>
&gt; they may &quot;road block&quot; a zone or mob for one reason or another.  Sometimes<br/>
&gt; they will make mistakes.  But any time there is a change in the status quo<br/>
&gt; -<br/>
&gt; you will hear complaints.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; some of what you said was my point, Naggy is upgraded, Vox is upgraded,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Innoruk (he&#39;s the one with DT, right?) is upgraded.  They did this<br/>
&gt; &gt; because they were dying too easily.  This is all fine and good for<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who have been there before, and have plane/dragon equipment and<br/>
&gt; &gt; plane/dragon experience. (Actually its not, but at least you had a shot<br/>
&gt; &gt; at it)  By the time we get there, there will be no chance.  We will not<br/>
&gt; &gt; be lvl 50 before expansion, I cant imagine what Verant is going to do to<br/>
&gt; &gt; all those guys then...<br/>
