&gt; There are also giant skeletons to the left just after you come in from<br/>
&gt; Feerott. You go through this V between two mountains, follow the right wall<br/>

&gt; follow that<br/>
&gt; hill to the LEFT until you get back to the GS camp.<br/>

<br/>
Most of the people hunting hill giants there kill the<br/>
skeletons just to get more giants to spawn.  If you tell them<br/>
you&#39;d like to hunt the skeletons, I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t mind<br/>
letting you have them all.  Just be sure to learn where things<br/>
spawn and walk around.  That lizard or basilisk you see<br/>
wandering around might be a hill giant next time.<br/>
