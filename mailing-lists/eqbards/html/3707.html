 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  I find I&#39;m of two minds about begging.  I tend not to like it in<br/>
many cases, but for some of my characters it seems reasonable if done with<br/>
discretion and in-character entertainment value.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I wouldn&#39;t even consider begging by broadcast, /ooc, /auc, or<br/>
/shout.  That is a sure way to incite my use of /ignore.<br/>
<br/>
Then it comes to judgment and style.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m offended by /tell or /say with a request for money or items for a<br/>
random newbie of just any race or class, in those terms, especially if<br/>
they&#39;re persistent.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand for a couple of my characters (both halflings), they&#39;re<br/>
likely to complement a person on their equipment and then say, &quot;Can I have<br/>
it?&quot;  In their case it&#39;s an in-character sense of community property and<br/>
little expectation of being given anything.  To be fair they will also<br/>
sometimes give to others, even unsolicited.<br/>
<br/>
My most outright case was walking my halfling warrior, my most likely<br/>
begger, into the Freeport bank and saying, &quot;Wow, can any of you rich folks<br/>
spare a few odd platinum for a hard-working but poor warrior?  Equipment is<br/>
really expensive around here.&quot;  I only did that once.  It got me 10<br/>
platinum from a high-level, well-equipped halfling woman.  I went on a<br/>
careful, judicious spending spree, after of course complementing her beauty<br/>
and generosity and promising to do good and be a mighty warrior.<br/>
<br/>
So am I kidding myself or is begging done skillfully and wisely a game<br/>
enhancement but done coarsely (and as if you&#39;re owed) worthy of being /ignored?<br/>
