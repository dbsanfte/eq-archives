<div id="ygrps-yiv-769323704">Anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
I stumbled in to Vahal the Vile (sp?) chasing some poor soul to the Stone<br/>
Bridge and slew-eth him!  So, I dutifully took the troll guts (ewww!) back<br/>
to the bardette in Qeynos and promptly attacked her!  Hey, I was eating some<br/>
spaghetti and things just got out of control - what can I say.  After I got<br/>
ressed back from Gfay, I got some lute strings and a quest to find Fabian.<br/>
Anyone know where he is?<br/>

p.s. Tallies, we you compiling the &quot;easter eggs&quot;?? Bard named Fabian == late<br/>
50&#39;s early 60&#39;s pop/rock singer named Fabian?</div>
