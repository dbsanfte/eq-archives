Well, if you MUST know....<br/>
<br/>
There have been times when I wake up in the morning in r/l and get to the<br/>
PC, log in, etc. etc. and there I am nekkid at me bind spot.  Hmmm, wonder<br/>
where I died last knight??? I vaguely remember something about South Karana.<br/>
Guess I&#39;ll head that way and check it out.  Zone to HH: you have no corpses<br/>
in the zone. Zone to EK: you have no corpses in the zone. Zone to NK: you<br/>
have no corpses in the zone. Zone to SK: you cannot summon that corpse from<br/>
here.  Ahh!  Time to mem Lyssia! =)<br/>
<br/>
Or I have come back to the screen and the text buffer is spammed with:<br/>
you are hungry<br/>
you are thristy<br/>
you are out of food<br/>
you are out of drink<br/>
<br/>
Look at my health bars and sta is at zero.  And I am either blocking a zone,<br/>
or nose against some far zone wall, or standing idly in the Gfay wiz spires<br/>
(I fall alseep zoning or traveling and either die, hit a wall, stay at zone<br/>
or my wiz fiends have been known to tele me to Gfay and leave me in the<br/>
relative safety there ;p)<br/>
<br/>
But even when I am awake, dungeons and me simply get me all mixed up. I get<br/>
lost really easy.  My group gets real sick of leading me and out all the<br/>
time.  Run to the zone?  You got to be kidding! Of course, it dont help when<br/>
the route you take in is different from the route to run out and you never<br/>
practice the run out (which I do now - when they take me somewhere new) &quot;ok,<br/>
jump down here..&quot;  Jump here? How the hell am I supposed to get out???<br/>
(Sol-a, Perma, and Lguk all have spots like that.)<br/>
<br/>
And the new places we got to now - you got to have an evac person or be<br/>
prepared to fite your way in and back out.  We spent a long knight in Lguk<br/>
Frenzied room.  At 3am as we were heading out, we decided to check the Exe<br/>
room but someone lost invis in the middle of the jail.  Soon we had more<br/>
than 10-15 froogies on us (full party of 6).  We paniced. Someone said Zone<br/>
and we bolted.  Now the number of froggies doubled.  I died real fast.  I<br/>
think 3 of the party made the zone.  We should have stood our ground and<br/>
fought.  We had an enchanter who 10 of the mezzed.  All we had to do was<br/>
kill them one by one. But we paniced and ran and that did half of us in.<br/>
<br/>
So, to answer your question, MOST of the time I know pretty much where I am<br/>
but if I am ever in doubt I just do /w sylly all and it tells me zactly<br/>
which zone I am in and then I am fine =)<br/>
<br/>
Sylly Songsynger<br/>
Bard of the 36th Song<br/>
&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
p.s. one time after helping someone get their corpse outta Runnyeye, we are<br/>
Selos back from Gorge to HH ramp and go thru that canyon by the shops.  I<br/>
see this corpse laying there and think: hmm, wonder who the fool was that<br/>
died here? So, I target and guess what? &quot;a Sylly corpse0&quot; Hehe, it&#39;s ME!!!<br/>
So, I go over and loot it - WOW so that&#39;s where my spare drum went!!!<br/>

After reading your recent posts about being lost all of the time, I have to<br/>
ask about your signature.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you say &quot;somewhere on Innoruuk&quot; because you don&#39;t know *where* exactly??<br/>
