<div id="ygrps-yiv-151028446">Depends on whether you&#39;re talking head/eye work or hand/eye twitch speed.<br/>
I&#39;ve got no problem with concentration.  I do have a problem with having to<br/>
&quot;work out my wrists&quot; to learn a repeated pattern.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found some other classes to require concentration, so far not the<br/>
twitchiness of Bards, and yes, with hot keys.  I enjoy having to think in<br/>
battle.  However, a Bard (unlike other casters) has to twitch to keep up 2<br/>
buffs/restores even when resting, and twitches to weave a buff/Selo when<br/>
travelling and twitches insanely if twisting and trying melee.  So while on<br/>
other casters, my fingers fly for short fight, they then get to rest while<br/>
the party rests.  On Bards I&#39;m finding thats not so.  Seems party<br/>
expectations and usefulness are determined by the Bard managing to twist<br/>
continously.  Some mid-level Bards feel free to tell me if I&#39;m wrong .. but<br/>
this is what I&#39;m reading here.  <br/>
<br/>
I am a carpal tunnel &quot;dodger&quot; with the ergonomic keyboard, trackball mouse<br/>
& pad, proper height chair .. etc ... and a diagnosable mild coordination<br/>
problem to boot.  As long as I don&#39;t play &quot;twitch&quot; games (a.k.a. most 1st<br/>
person shooters) I do fine.  I guess I&#39;ve just been a little surprised by<br/>
the Bard&#39;s need to twist constantly.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Not only that, I think EVERY class has to do something with hot keys during<br/>
&gt;&gt;a battle!<br/>

&gt;Comparing to real complications, consider a battle cleric, such as played<br/>
&gt;by a friend of mine and as I&#39;ve tried some myself.  During combat, while<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re hitting and perhaps being hit, you have to keep an eye everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt;health and if someone is getting too low, target, cast, then return to the<br/>
&gt;target you were hitting.  Make that worse by using your own damage spells<br/>
&gt;sometimes, balancing that against potentially vital healing.  And you get<br/>
&gt;to decide what&#39;s &quot;too low.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Makes playing a bard and twisting songs seem easy.<br/>
