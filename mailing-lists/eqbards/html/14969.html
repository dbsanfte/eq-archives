&gt;I have several customers that I would like to cast See Invoice on.  Despite<br/>
&gt;repeated mailings they still claim that they &quot;never got them&quot;.  I have come<br/>
&gt;to suspect that the Invoices have somehow become invisible in transit and<br/>
&gt;are actually in their in boxes.  Can you tell me where this song/spell is<br/>
&gt;found?  It sounds like Ak&#39;Anon or Erudin libraries perhaps?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, See Invoice was bugged, and has been removed until they can find out <br/>
what caused it to work.  When they can return it to it&#39;s previously <br/>
non-functioning status, it will be implemented as a 49th level spell <br/>
requiring a 20 pound, 5000 platinum material component, and it will <br/>
automatically cause all monsters in the zone to go aggro on the caster.<br/>
