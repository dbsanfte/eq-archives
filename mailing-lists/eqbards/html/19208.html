<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-171699878">I juuust have to say, 6+ member groups is an exploit. The use of exploits<br/>
fundamentally chnges the game experience for yourself and others and brings<br/>
on more and more restrictive coding that very often negativly affects other<br/>
&quot;freedom&quot;s in the game. I will not participate in a seven member group, I<br/>
leave, and petition them. Using exploits is irresponsible and selfish I<br/>
happily petition whenever and wherever I see them being used..<br/>
