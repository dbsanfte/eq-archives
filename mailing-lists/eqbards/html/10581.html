&gt;Noon on a Friday?  What college student is organizing this shindig anyhow?  <br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want to sound *too* much like the decrepid cog in the workforce <br/>
&gt;that I am, but some of us might have to work and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  The &quot;college student&quot; is Manager of Clinical Research at a medical <br/>
products firm, who is almost never free on Saturdays, but amazingly gets a <br/>
work holiday every now and again. = )<br/>
<br/>
I really am sorry I can&#39;t choose a day that works for everyone.  Since this <br/>
idea was kicked around for over a month, nobody ever chose a day... I picked <br/>
one that was convenient for me, and for many others.<br/>
<br/>
If you are able to come, please do.  I hope it will be fun for everyone <br/>
involved.<br/>
