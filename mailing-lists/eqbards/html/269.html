 </span></blockquote>I have a good friend who&#39;s a cleric and we tend to be of like mind on<br/>
subjects such as this.  I&#39;m going to approach him about working on a<br/>
constitution.  If we decide to move ahead, I&#39;ll come back here with the<br/>
plan, for discussion of the charter, and to solicit members.<br/>
<br/>
I would expect help to be extended somewhat neutrally, although blindly and<br/>
foolishly helping the evil to commit more evil would be going too far.<br/>
<br/>
The charter would be long on principles of honesty and reasonable<br/>
unselfishness and short on exact specifics of behavior.  The idea is for<br/>
the guild name to be a badge of trust.  One who betrayed that trust would<br/>
be removed.  My first thought is to do that based on testimony and evidence<br/>
presented to a guild council.<br/>
