<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   To make a long story short, it was my assumption that he and his<br/>
&gt;   team were disgusted with the fact that the team I was with was<br/>
&gt;   even on the planes after they had reserved it.  As soon as I<br/>
&gt;   approached the Maestro corpse, the person in question bent down,<br/>
&gt;   and the corpse disappeared.  He stated he accidentally looted it<br/>
&gt;   and never apologized at all.  In fact no one did from the other<br/>
&gt;   team.  It&#39;s all really suspicious.  And while they didn&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt;   let anyone loot it.  We had been sharing nodrops the whole night.<br/>
&gt;   I just hope that he didn&#39;t do it on purpose.  I&#39;m trying to believe<br/>
&gt;   that he didn&#39;t, because I really respect the guy.<br/>
