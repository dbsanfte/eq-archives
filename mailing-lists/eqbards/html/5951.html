  I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t know all the ins and outs of this worm, but Bobby did<br/>
not know he sent the Worm.  Happy99 works by taking over your email, and<br/>
emailing itself to your friends and relatives (your address book).  I have<br/>
blocked him from any further mailings to the list until he has cleaned his<br/>
harddrive, but I assure you, there was no malicious intent on his part.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being patient!<br/>
