<div id="ygrps-yiv-98003694">Well, I spoke with my contact in the guild last night, and he seemed <br/>
amenable to the trade, however, he had no idea what the Lute was or where <br/>
it dropped.  Judging by the rarity, I think it&#39;s safe to assume they don&#39;t <br/>
have one in the bank, so it may be some time...<br/>
  This guy&#39;s a personal friend, so I know he&#39;ll do what&#39;s best for me and <br/>
the Guild at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep you updated!<br/>
