<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875113700">Cataloguing Libretto will tell you if it is a corrupt or loyal guard<br/>
bracer in the Lore information the song gives. This song is also great<br/>
for keeping straight which Rune of the One Eye is which, and Runes of<br/>
Ivy. In Lore: it will tell you &quot;middle portion&quot; etc.<br/>

&gt; BTW, if you happen upon a Guard&#39;s body and happen to loot a no-drop<br/>
&gt; &quot;guard bracer&quot; and think &quot;maybe this is the one the Captain in NK guard<br/>
&gt; tower is looking for&quot; and you decide to give it to him, If you are wrong<br/>
&gt; and it is from a good guard, you better be ready to take the jump off<br/>
&gt; the tower, because is appears he can tell the difference... not that I<br/>
&gt; would know (rubbing his backside from the fall).<br/>
