<div id="ygrps-yiv-895952218">Jyzan mentioned in an earlier post that during the beta, a few bards were<br/>
offering their services to travellers wishing to speedily travel from<br/>
Freeport to Qeynos.  They were charging 1-2 PPs per person.  That sounds<br/>
like a great alternative for making some cash other than the standard trade<br/>
skills and adventuring.  What does everyone else think?  Is this a viable<br/>
way to make money?   <br/>
<br/>
I am fairly new to the game and have not ventured anywhere other than on the<br/>
Faydark continent.  As a result, I am not certain of all the perils of cross<br/>
country travel on other continents.  I am also unaware of how long it takes<br/>
for another class (at standard movement rates) to travel from Point A to<br/>
Point B on the other continents.  Do you guys think that other players, in<br/>
order to maximize their adventuring potential by decreasing travel times,<br/>
would be willing to pay for this service? <br/>
<br/>
If we agree this is a viable service, I was thinking that we could use this<br/>
forum as a place to agree on standard service rates from Point A to Point B<br/>
for each continent.  I will consolidate all the recommendations I receive<br/>
and publish a list that everyone can use if they wish to perform this<br/>
service.  Of course, like all other services, final prices would still be<br/>
negotiable and subject to the supply/demand laws.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in order to make this work, bards will have to start advertising the<br/>
service to their fellow players.  Amazingly, I grouped with some guys the<br/>
other day, all 8-10th level, who had never travelled cross-country with a<br/>
bard before.  We started in Kelethin and went to the Mino caves in<br/>
Steamfont.  They were amazed at how fast we got there.  Everyone made a<br/>
comment they were glad to have me in the group.  They were even more<br/>
gracious when we had to start fleeing from some Mino slavers:-)  <br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think, both positive or negative.<br/>
