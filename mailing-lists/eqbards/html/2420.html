<div id="ygrps-yiv-725257284">i know i am going to regret this.<br/>
<br/>
can we leave all the roleplaying vs. powergaming controversy off this list?<br/>
is there another list for roleplaying issues?  i just find it hard to<br/>
restrain myself when all of these ardent roleplayers tell everyone how the<br/>
game is supposed to be played, they start reminding me of the religious<br/>
right.  sure they always qualify it by saying &quot;you can do what you want but<br/>
i do this&quot; but i just get the feeling they have a strong distaste for people<br/>
who don&#39;t play their way.<br/>
<br/>
yes it is a role-playing game, but it remains that it is a GAME.  therefore<br/>
it is supposed to be fun.  i don&#39;t see how 100% powergamers or 100%<br/>
roleplayers can ever have any fun!  they are too busy worrying about their<br/>
idea of playing.  that is why i &quot;try&quot; to stay right in the middle.<br/>
everytime i lean towards the powergaming side i start to not have fun, and<br/>
yes of course i lean in this direction sometimes, you can&#39;t get to my level<br/>
without some powergaming.  and then my wife asks me why i even play cause<br/>
i&#39;m always miserable worrying about levelling or an item, and i have to<br/>
relax a little and try to have more fun.  that&#39;s what it is all about.  it&#39;s<br/>
not real life, don&#39;t take it so seriously.  worry about your own play and<br/>
have fun, that&#39;s why everquest was made.<br/>
