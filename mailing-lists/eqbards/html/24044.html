<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008303060">Okay - I&#39;ve been following this thread for a couple days and I&#39;m pretty<br/>
confused as to what Whee is really arguing about.  It mostly seems to be<br/>
rhetorical debate; or perhaps the comment that people are exaggerating too<br/>
much.  Keep in mind that  - like analogies exaggerating the opposite of what<br/>
you are arguing is also a rhetorical device.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean this as a flame to Whee, (by singling him out); but the<br/>
argument (if I&#39;m not following it correctly I apologize in advance) seems to<br/>
be that the thread is Whee one side and everyone else (who participating in<br/>
the thread) on the other.<br/>
<br/>
1) DDD - are you saying that this IS a useful song?  That 99 pct of the<br/>
Bards are wrong - that it is VERY useful; or simply that it is very slightly<br/>
useful and we are &quot;ridiculously exaggerating&quot; by saying something is<br/>
&quot;completely&quot; useless instead of &quot;very marginally&quot; useless.  Not MUCH of an<br/>
exaggeration there if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
2) The PvP thing was argued a bit - but someone pointed out how Verant has<br/>
made it very clear they claim they are specifically tuning this song to<br/>
balance bards across the board.  There has been no indication that this is a<br/>
PVP.  While it could be a &quot;stealth component&quot; of the tuning a) I doubt it<br/>
and b) it&#39;s not taking the issue at face value especially considering the<br/>
whole &quot;Class Balance&quot; threads<br/>
<br/>
3) Bards are over powered.  You haven&#39;t really spent much time arguing<br/>
that - and I&#39;m not quite clear on your argument for that.   Perhaps it is<br/>
due to soloing ability.  I despise soloing and never do it.  Personally - if<br/>
you were to judge EQ as a solo game; it is VERY poor.  Any single-player RPG<br/>
game rings around EQ as a single-player game.  If I felt like single-player<br/>
gaming I&#39;d play BG2.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the argument was spent on time arguing percentages - but that was<br/>
pretty much arguing 1+2 I guess...<br/>
<br/>
The thread kind of reminds me of the Monty Python Argument sketch - the<br/>
argument SEEMS to be going nowhere just argument for arguments sake (that&#39;s<br/>
an exaggeration too by the way)<br/>
<br/>
Again - I don&#39;t mean this as a flame - or even negative in any way - I&#39;m<br/>
just intellectually both intrigued and very confused at the same time as to<br/>
what is REALLY being argued...<br/>
