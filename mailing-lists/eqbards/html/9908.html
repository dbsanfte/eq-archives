<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700923101">Tracking is IMO the best skill in the game.  On night me and another 35th <br/>
level bard were in N Karana hunting Griffenes for our charms and it was <br/>
amzaing out fast we could depop the zone of any griffs or hill giants that <br/>
were unlucky enough to show up on our tracking.  There was even a Guide <br/>
watching us for part of the night, I guess someone felt we were too <br/>
successful :)   My partner Ziann had the largest train of the night, he <br/>
managed to grab 5 griffawns at once, which were quickly dispatch by our 50th <br/>
level shamen.<br/>

&gt;   I don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger, or forage - but I<br/>
&gt;WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My track capped out at 100 i believe. and i find it very very useful.<br/>
&gt;especially in Solb when there are 40 - 50 people there. I can find that dog<br/>
&gt;that just spawned before other people.  :)<br/>
