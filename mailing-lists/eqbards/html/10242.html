&gt;There&#39;s a rumor that ykeshas aren&#39;t being dropped as of the last patch.<br/>
&gt;Please someone tell me this isn&#39;t true, I still haven&#39;t gotten one.  Does<br/>
&gt;anyone know ANYBODY who got a ykesha last night?<br/>
<br/>

auctioning ykeshas for trade.  Don&#39;t know if anyone got one last night, <br/>
though.<br/>
