<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bards vs Clerics in melee <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-410691016">The mere fact that there would be a MAJOR UPROAR makes it obvious that not<br/>
being able to bind is a far more serious detriment than you would have us<br/>
believe.  Binding is bar-none the most powerful ability in the game, period.<br/>
There is no ability that makes up for it nor any package of abilities that<br/>
does so balance-wise.<br/>
<br/>
To call Clerics pure casters is a joke.  Clerics and Shamans are hybrids<br/>
plain and simple.  Both can melee effectively at some levels and sit back<br/>
and cast at other levels.  Pure casters are never effective at melee.  There<br/>
are four Pure caster classes in this game.  Magician, Enchanter, Wizard, and<br/>
Necromancer.  Clerics, Druids and Shamans are hybrids that lean heavily to<br/>
caster.  Shadowknights, Rangers, and Paladins are hybrids that lean heavily<br/>
towards melee.  Balance would suggest that Bards are hybrids that lean<br/>
neither way.  We get the worst of both worlds for the most part.  The lousy<br/>
defensive skills of the caster hybrids and the lousy offensive spells of the<br/>
melee hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a particular type of person to have fun playing a bard.  Bards can<br/>
be fun to play, no doubt about it, but those who find them so, myself<br/>
included, would have fun playing a bard no matter what the abilities were<br/>
just because that&#39;s the type of people we are.  I&#39;d just like to be able to<br/>
have as much fun playing the class I am most attracted to as my friends do<br/>
playing the class they are most attracted to.  Right now, character<br/>
balance-wise, that ain&#39;t happenin&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and the Identify spell isn&#39;t the only spell those pure casters get at<br/>
that level is it?  In fact it isnt even one of 4 per level group but more<br/>
like 1 of 8 or ten.  also our 12th level DD does 7 points of damage max.<br/>
Yeah we can cast it a lot if we don&#39;t cast anything else since none of our<br/>
spells have the 45+ minute duration of cleric buffs.<br/>

[mini cleric topic]<br/>
Just to clear up any misconceptions here are the Cleric DD spells<br/>
Lvl - Dam/mana - Name<br/>
1  - 10/12 - Strike<br/>
5  - 19/20 - Furor<br/>
14 - 83/70 - Smite<br/>
29 - 200/145 - Wrath<br/>
44 - 510/240 - Resolution<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, these are some of the worst DD spells in the game.  And<br/>
after level 14, there is a 15 level gap before an improvement.  The levels<br/>
just before a spell upgrade are the hardest, as you are using spells from 14<br/>
levels ago.  I do believe that Clerics are positioned just about right for<br/>
DD spells, as they do have better defence compared to all other pure<br/>
casters.  There are some sweet spots just after they get a new spell where<br/>
they can solo somewhat, but there are dead spots where they are very<br/>
ineffective with DD spells.<br/>
<br/>
[back to bards]<br/>
Here was the original message I replied to:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As a result, [hybrids] get magic<br/>
&gt; plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all<br/>
&gt; other hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told,<br/>
&gt; then perhaps we can get a<br/>
&gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, instead of arguing about the battle worthness of a Bard I should have<br/>
just used your own argument against you.  The level 14 song was a pure<br/>
caster type song.  Only pure casters got the identify spell.  You felt that<br/>
bards needed a pure caster type song, and you already had it.  Happy now?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If any class (Bards for example) get binding, there will be a major uproar<br/>
from all other classes without binding.  I mean MAJOR UPROAR.  So it doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter what kind of Vulcan logic you use to argue that Bards need binding it<br/>
won&#39;t happen.  Putting BardBind in your petition will do no good at all, and<br/>
probably cause Verant to not fully consider the rest of your petition.<br/>
<br/>
What you need to ask for is to have all classes be able to bind anywhere (or<br/>
maybe just Inns) they choose instead of just a city.  Verant is much more<br/>
likely to consider something that would be fair to all classes, and not just<br/>
for Bards.<br/>
