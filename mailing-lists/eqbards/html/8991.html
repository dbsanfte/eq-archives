&gt; &gt; Well last night while praying for trains in mistmoore so me and another<br/>
&gt; &gt; bardic friend could try to pick off a gypsie or a deathly usher i got<br/>
&gt; bored<br/>
&gt; &gt; and decided to go pull some stuff....   So i go to the cemetary, i see a<br/>
&gt; &gt; named invisible npc with a book in hand named something like Ssinn or<br/>
&gt; &gt; something like that. Hmmm i think to myself, maybe its the red robe npc<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; he&#39;s green to me and scowling ready to attack.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyways, to make a long story short, i screwed up big time, Turns out it<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; a quest npc for the sol ro temple<br/>
&gt; &gt; your faction with sol ro got worse<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh.  We did the same thing.  I&#39;m constantly telling everyone<br/>
&gt; to con stuff before they attack, because I&#39;ll end up receiving<br/>
&gt; any bad faction hits they take.  But as usual they charged<br/>
&gt; right in and attacked, and considering we had three other mobs<br/>
&gt; on us at the time (yeah, another guy was pulling while this<br/>
&gt; was going on), I didn&#39;t have much choice but to help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This book guy is like all shadowmen - he /cons ready to<br/>
&gt; attack, but is non-aggressive.  Hail him.  If he calls you a<br/>
&gt; piece of refuse, hit him with the faction song.  He should<br/>
&gt; tell you about a quest to retrieve a flower from inside the<br/>
&gt; crypt.  Go inside the crypt (walk straight in because on<br/>
&gt; either side of the floor is a pit trap).  On the coffin<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a bag, which is really a flower.  Pick it up and give<br/>
&gt; it to the book.  The flower respawns every few minutes so you<br/>
&gt; can do this over and over.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re beyond the point where the faction song helps, then<br/>
&gt; I hear there are other quests you can do to raise your faction<br/>
&gt; with Solusek Ro.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Always /con and hail new stuff before you attack.<br/>
