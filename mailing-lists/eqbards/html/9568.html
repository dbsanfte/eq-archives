<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484472620">There are a lot of points to this discussion.  Many people want a dynamic<br/>
game with more &#39;real&#39; feel to it.  The undead invasion definitely accomplish<br/>
both those goals.  <br/>
I&#39;d even like to see a war over the commonlands where dark elf and freeport<br/>
soldiers of various levels started spawning and fighting both each other and<br/>
the players in the area.  Very realistic, a pain if you want to travel<br/>
freely but so what that&#39;s the way it would be if this were real.<br/>
<br/>
Q Hills may be a newbie zone but Kithicor really isn&#39;t.  Most of the people<br/>
who hunt in Kithicor (never more than 12 at a time on E&#39;ci before now) hunt<br/>
the orcs along the west wall and are levels 15-20.  The ranger guild there<br/>
is new and besieged already according to the storyline so even that part<br/>
makes sense.  All the ghoul messenger stuff was a foreshadowing of this<br/>
eventuality so it should not have been much of a surprise that something was<br/>
going to happen in Kithicor.<br/>
<br/>
Why of all people would bards complain about this?  I can tell from comments<br/>
on this list that I may not be a master tactician or combat fighter, but<br/>
apparently I am a master traveler.  I found Kithicor exciting in the heart<br/>
of the event with red undead all around.  I did corpse recoveries for plays<br/>
twice my level who were going to wait for daylight until I showed them how<br/>
easily I could run thru and avoid getting hurt.  I even helped out in a<br/>
meager way with a few battles and healing people up in between battles.  <br/>
<br/>
It would take extremely bad luck or carelessness for a bard over 15th level<br/>
to die in Kithicor even with the undead out and about.  I ran thru about 20<br/>
times dodging undead and never took more than a bubble of damage at a time.<br/>
Yes, I had to keep my eyes open and be really careful, but tension is fun!<br/>
Once a zombie commander spawned right beside me, I just hit the Incoming to<br/>
Rivervale button and kept on motoring along.  The reception committee at<br/>
Rivervale made short work of the commander.  If they couldn&#39;t have they<br/>
would have zoned and so would I, no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I think events like this are good for the game.  They create an atmosphere<br/>
of excitement and menace.  They make the game feel real.  Most importantly<br/>
of all they give Bards a chance to shine as we can usually deal with events<br/>
like this long before other classes can and provide actual meaningful<br/>
support to people far beyond our experience.  <br/>
<br/>
Pick up your tents, put out your campfires, and go out there and experience<br/>
the world!  It&#39;s an exciting dangerous place, full of adventure.<br/>
