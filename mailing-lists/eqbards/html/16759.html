<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  All I have to say is three words:  Events, Dragons, Planes.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s behind about normal terra combat.  We have the<br/>
  songs and powers already for standard mob combat.  I want to be useful<br/>
  for big things, not exp/item farming.<br/>
<br/>
  Everyone in their brother is gonna do clops/dino/bugs, etc to earn<br/>
  lots of fast exp (not to mention any new zones in Kunark).  Those<br/>
  creatures we already have the capability of defeating right now.<br/>
  I can fight seafuries until I&#39;m around L55.  Sure it&#39;s boring, but<br/>
  it&#39;s steady and easy exp.<br/>
<br/>
  If 3 or 4 of our songs incapacitated us in some way and were<br/>
  tremendously powerful ...so powerful all groups would want a bard...<br/>
  then yes, I&#39;m willing to give up being able to chain-sing those<br/>
  songs and keep them manabased.  (Mana = time directly anyway)<br/>
<br/>
  If we had a song that x2 /all/ damage from the party, there&#39;s no<br/>
  way that isn&#39;t going to be controlled.  Recycle time doesn&#39;t work<br/>
  with us, our songs are all alike.  The manabar is used as a time<br/>
  cycle control.  So, double damage to the party at no cost?  Just<br/>
  as a regular song?  F&#39;no, Verant would never allow it.  But if it<br/>
  cost like 50 mana per tick, that&#39;s 120 seconds of straight singing.<br/>
  /Plenty/ long enough to kill a dragon or god.  If I had this song<br/>
  right now and could only play it 2 mins before I ran out of mana,<br/>
  I bet I&#39;d be in a dragon/god group /every,every,every/ time.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not fighting skeletons or polar bears anymore.  There&#39;s no reason<br/>
  to upgrade our existing songs, they should grow with us in the <br/>
  expansion.  We need brand new songs that use mana control for very<br/>
  powerful effects.  And like I said, that&#39;s only a quarter of the <br/>
  songs as an estimate.  The rest would be standard no cost songs.<br/>
