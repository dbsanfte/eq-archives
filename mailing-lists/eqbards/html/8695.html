<div id="ygrps-yiv-647935759">hehe same thing with me, i have to talk to the server GM this afternoon.<br/>
either it is broken, or the lute of the gypsy princess is the wrong lute<br/>
(how many frickin gypsy lutes come from mistmoore? cause that is what<br/>
Cryssia asks for).  get your server GM and talk to him/her.  i was also<br/>
quite disappointed to say the least.  if i am told it is the wrong lute then<br/>
that is ok, just give me the items back (lost 304pp on the rubies, plus i<br/>
never was able to loot a lambent stone it was given to me).<br/>
