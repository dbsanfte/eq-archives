<b>Subject:</b> Anthem vs Celerity <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-134443126">Had the pleasure last night of grouping with Kemvar in the Tiger room for a <br/>
good amount of time. Up until I came into the group He said he had been using <br/>
Anthem de Arms. Kem had mentioned that He and a monk had done some testing <br/>
anf they felt Anthem was faster that Celerity. Wondering if there was anyone <br/>
out there who had also done some testing and if so what were the results?<br/>
<br/>
Thank yall,<br/>
