&gt;I&#39;m glad you posted this as I had also heard it but my source wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;quite as unimpeachable as yours so I didn&#39;t want to get into a big flame<br/>
&gt;war about it. My same source (another beta tester from P2 on) also said<br/>
&gt;JM&#39;s main char through most of beta was a rogue. Still, he seemed to<br/>
&gt;know a fair bit about bards and had some useful information. Shame he<br/>
&gt;seems to be gone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well having been in beta since phase one, Capozzi&#39;s name was awefully<br/>
familiar to me from chat sessions, but untill you posted this i couldnt<br/>
place it. He played the highest level character in beta for the longest<br/>
time, Kendrick the rogue. My first run in was with him at level 12 and me<br/>
as a level 4 erudite wizard named Emandin. He saved me from some particular<br/>
nasty klicknik worker and gave me 100 silver to boot! I was thunderstruck,<br/>
a level 12 character! Was very impressed, but that was the last i saw of<br/>
him as he quickly advanced and started hunting in places i could not. <br/>
<br/>
&lt; starts talking like an old timer, muttering about the degeneracy found in<br/>
today&#39;s youth&gt;<br/>
Back then i remember when you died you lost a bubble and  half from dying!<br/>
And you needed a topaz if you wanted to be bound, and those where only sold<br/>
in Highhold! Kids today got it too easy!<br/>
&lt; nods off and starts to snore in his rocking chair&gt;<br/>

Gendal Concorden, lvl 50 bard of Tunare<br/>
Who is very glad that bind no longer requires a topaz and you lose little<br/>
to no xp from dying anymore (compartively anyways).</div>
