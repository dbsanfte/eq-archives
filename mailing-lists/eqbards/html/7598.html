<div id="ygrps-yiv-99135676">On EQLizer is a brief report on the new zone Temple of Solusek Ro.  The guy<br/>
who wrote the report went there on the test server.  Apparently this zone is<br/>
not intended to be a standard adventuring zone but a quest-oriented zone.<br/>
Supposedly, no matter what your race or class, all the NPCs in there  /con<br/>
indifferent to you.  The quests are supposed to be class specific and each<br/>
NPC is supposed to give multiple quests.  Its possible that the quests are<br/>
all connected and that when you finish the final quest, you get a nice item<br/>
usuable by your class only.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone been on the test server since the zone was added to confirm if<br/>
bard only quests were implemented?  If there were, the letter we are sending<br/>
to GZ may need to get revised to remove that concern.  If there isn&#39;t a bard<br/>
NPC in Solusek Ro, then perhaps it should be revised to also voice a concern<br/>
about the lack of a bard quest in Solusek Ro.<br/>
