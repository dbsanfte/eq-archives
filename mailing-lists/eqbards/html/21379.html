<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594554393">Hah!  Those tiny potholes are nothing compared to the one I fell into in<br/>
Warslik&#39;s.  Luckily I landed on a giant Lizard statue, but I still took 400<br/>
points.  Scary thing was, where I landed couldn&#39;t have been more than a<br/>
third of the way to the bottom.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you able to hotkey Safe Fall? I use this skill just by falling off<br/>
&gt;things, not by pressing a hot key for it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah - you&#39;ll notice it also mentioned &quot;can&#39;t live without&quot; - my guess is, a <br/>
lot of Bards have problems with cliffs ;)<br/>
