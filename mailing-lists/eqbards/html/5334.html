<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-432108279">My armor and weapons total, with 3 weapons, is 53 lbs.  I wear Crush&#39;s<br/>
tunic, very light AC12 and +8 to Magic/Fire/Cold.  I also wear a lizardscale<br/>
mantle, used to wear a mesh mantle though, smae ac as leather, but far<br/>
lighter.  I wear barbed sleves now, but they are kinda heavy so I may trade<br/>
them in an go back to mesh sleeves.  I wear mesh pants, a leatherfoot raider<br/>
cap, same ac as leather.  I haven&#39;t had any difficulties staying in fights<br/>
so far, despite my light armor.  I have found that while I often take big<br/>
hits, I get hit less often due to more frequent dodges.  It seems to work<br/>
out fairly close to the same as when I tried going all banded and its far<br/>
lighter.  In all banded I was close to max weight with no loot and only two<br/>
weapons.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of armour I can<br/>
&gt;get that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives, or<br/>
&gt;somewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can even go<br/>
&gt;out and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income if cheap<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would suggest a bloodstained tunic, lizzie scale mantle and cloack, and<br/>
blackend armor for the rest.  Looks great and if weight is an issue it will<br/>
help alot. Yes the armor is NICE to have..I persoanlly wear a combo of<br/>
charred plate and bronze right now, but i have so many strength enhancers it<br/>
isnt even funny! As a young bard the above items will be abit above your<br/>
level for now..but well within the grasp of a rich bard..so get your mage to<br/>
support you (LOL). Good luck to you Melaniel. May your songs be well<br/>
recieved!<br/>
