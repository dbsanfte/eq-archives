<div id="ygrps-yiv-27475881">I have been at 5 GM events (lucky i guess).  All 5 have basically<br/>
degenrated the way you desribed it.  I cant imagie doing that job, as I<br/>
would get very upset.  Fortunatly future Multiplayer games will help<br/>
with this as they will be &quot;invite only&quot; .  I refer to games like<br/>
NeverWinter Nights and Vampire...<br/>
