<b>Subject:</b> Petition and general opinions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-510228912">The petition (posted at least twice today) brought to light several *very*<br/>
important Bardic issues (I can only hope that the other classes have as<br/>
much itelligent discussion going on.)<br/>
What I&#39;d like to address is just a few of them, however:<br/>
First, the experience penalty:<br/>
Working under the assumption that we are balanced exactly like all other<br/>
hybrids, then the Bard *does* suffer a bit in comparison.  But we are not<br/>
designed for soloing like the Ranger or Paladin are.  Frankly, anyone who<br/>
complains about not being able to solo well as a Bard is missing the point<br/>
to being a Bard.  You want to be alone?  Play a Ranger.  (And yes, I have<br/>
to yell at myself about this all the time).  Each class has a niche for a<br/>
reason.  Just as we feel it is silly for a Wizard to complain about not<br/>
being able to wear plate or not being able to do 16 points of damage/hit,<br/>
it is silly to complain about Bards not being great soloists.<br/>
So what does this have to do with the experience penalty?  Well, frankly,<br/>
if you&#39;re grouping, you should be gaining experience faster.  True, each<br/>
kill gives you less, but the overall result of being able to kill<br/>
repeatedly in shorter periods of time, or handle multiple creatures at a<br/>
time balances that out. Bards, as a rule, will do much better in groups.<br/>
And groups, as a rule, will do much better with Bards (*grin*)<br/>
<br/>
2nd Point:<br/>
Bardic Magic Weapons:<br/>
Hello (McFly!) - musical instruments ARE our weapons.  I would like to see<br/>
more interesting instruments to play (both normal AND magical) than to have<br/>
more weapons &quot;just for Bards&quot;.  We are the &quot;Jacks of All Trades&quot; - we<br/>
should borrow weapons from other classes (and do.)  While I like the idea<br/>
of a &quot;Singing Sword&quot;, I think that we should really focus more on our<br/>
strengths than our weaknesses at this point.  And I can&#39;t wait to see<br/>
Musical Instruments being made (*polite cough*)<br/>
<br/>
3rd Point:<br/>
If they *do* decide to allow Bards to bind ourselves, I think that it<br/>
should be 1) higher than 8th circle - like closer to 12th or 15th, and 2)<br/>
Suck mana like DDD.  Why?  Well, first off, we&#39;re once again treading into<br/>
the realm of the spellcaster (something they really hate).  Game balance<br/>
MUST be preserved.  Wouldn&#39;t be real fair to have you binding yourself just<br/>
everydarned where, with no penalty.<br/>
<br/>
And my final point of the night: (And here&#39;s where I expect to work on my<br/>
dodge skill:) I think Bards should be denied Plate Mail.  Already I can<br/>
hear the Battle Bards winding up - but hear me out:  The Bard was never<br/>
intended to be a grunt-class.  The big burly types should be the ones<br/>
soaking the damage and such, not us.  Of course, before they make any<br/>
changes like this, they should also fix that tiny little bug that makes us<br/>
the primary target ALL the time :(<br/>
<br/>
Them&#39;s my bits.  Happy Songs, all. <br/>
