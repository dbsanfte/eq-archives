<b>Subject:</b> PoF and bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-536136892">About two weeks ago our server finally broke in again to the PoF too. I<br/>
went everyday since opening day of the pof before the patch, so i had<br/>
almost a complete set (was missing guantlets, which i now have,  and arms,<br/>
but i had russet arms so screw the bard arms lol). Its sooo nice that the<br/>
boogies and samhains do not crash the zone now, that was hell on bards<br/>
before cause nobody would touch something that would crash the zone. <br/>
	Anyways, what i would like to hear is what all the other bards do in the<br/>
pof. I primarily play the role of crowd control, if we get more than one<br/>
mob (which is 90% of the time) i pixie strike the xtra one. Fiends, toads,<br/>
tentacles, boogymen, scarelings i can mez without much of a problem. Amy<br/>
knights and warriors are easy with the lvl 49 tashan too. Gorgons, phants<br/>
are both mezzable to, but their stuns make that difficult (course having 98<br/>
minus any songs stops that). Enchanters can mez there too of course, but<br/>
they all give up after a few attempts usually. Somebody always hits the<br/>
mezzed stuff and then the mezzer has to tank it for a short period.<br/>
Enchanters die to fast, colorflux etc not withstanding. This is with 30<br/>
people... with 12 its much easier to mez. So many things can trip you up<br/>
from pets attacking stuff that jumped their masters to aoe weapons and<br/>
spells. However, when it works, it works great and the effect is dramatic.<br/>
We have pulled off killing 7 mobs at once with two bards and pets, we can<br/>
hardly handle 4 unless we have one bard mezzing. Then of course you have<br/>
group lev for the worry wraiths and frightfingers who like to cast<br/>
gravityflux and then the standard bard songs, especially the magic<br/>
resistance ones. <br/>
<br/>
What do you other bards do in the PoF? Would be curious to hear what all<br/>
the other strategies are. <br/>
Oh yeah, i am also the primary puller alot of the time too heh, with the<br/>
enchanter buff and just one magic resistance song playing i never die,<br/>
simply resist everything that kills our tanks like fear, stone breath, etc.<br/>
Well actually i did die once today with all that running a worry wraith<br/>
dispelled my sow and i dropped like a rock. Didnt have near enough time of<br/>
course to start up selos. <br/>
<br/>
Egads i am tired, did two spawns today of the pof (12 hour spawn). No<br/>
cazic, bastard wont spawn for us =(<br/>

&gt;speaking of fear, our server had just been able to break through 2 days ago<br/>
&gt;for the first time since they nerfed it many weeks ago. last night was the<br/>
&gt;first time i returned since then.  in those earlier visits i obtained<br/>
&gt;imbrued boot and legs, and i was happy to have even gotten that (got a helm<br/>
&gt;too but helms don&#39;t count being a wood elf).  well last night within 10<br/>
&gt;minutes i got an imbrued breastplate.  we killed the boogey who had it, and<br/>
&gt;about 6 other mobs came so the GG word was given out.  since our group got<br/>
&gt;the kill and the loot time had not run out, everyone yelled for me to loot<br/>
&gt;it, it was either i loot it or it poofs.  i felt bad, but the same thing has<br/>
&gt;happened many times in PoF.  so i now have the only 3 pieces i ever wanted<br/>
&gt;of imbrued, to go along with the full set of lambent.  my wife is gonna have<br/>
&gt;a field day with her new wardrobes.<br/>

&gt;&gt; On a side note, my friend says there seem to be slightly less <br/>
&gt;&gt; wandering mobs <br/>
&gt;&gt; in PoF, but since they are still new at hunting their they <br/>
&gt;&gt; get their butts <br/>
&gt;&gt; kicked regularly. Here&#39;s to perseverance!<br/>
