<div id="ygrps-yiv-408999933">Not knowing what options are available to rogues, I don&#39;t have a huge<br/>
problem with him getting the fang, my only concern is that he won&#39;t use it<br/>
24 / 7 like I will. The EBW is too good not to be used all the time.<br/>
<br/>
As for damage, he&#39;s a rogue, he&#39;ll significantly out damage me using<br/>
anything. (Backstab is huge. His record so far is 163)<br/>

arguably he&#39;d do more damage then a bard with an EBW, since he has double<br/>
attack.<br/>
if he was in my group i&#39;d have no problem letting him be in lotto.<br/>
also the sword also looks very cool.  every bard knows how important looks<br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
i was kicked out of the running for a fbss presumably because bards have<br/>
haste songs.  i didn&#39;t make a fuss but it still burns me up and i&#39;ll no<br/>
longer have a problem if casters want in on fbss lotto :)<br/>

The Fangs are indeed droppable and they generally go for around 1.5 - 2 k p.<br/>
But I don&#39;t think that he has intentions of selling it. (If he does, I&#39;ll<br/>
kill him.) He said that he would actually use. (Why is beyond me, highest<br/>
I&#39;ve played a rogue to is level 5)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna try a different tactic tonight. I&#39;ll calmly explain that if I had<br/>
the EBW it would not leave my hand until I was wielding planar loot. If he<br/>
can&#39;t say the same thing, but still insists on rolling then I may have to<br/>
kill him.<br/>

I was wondering why the rogue would think he needed the EBW as well.  Since<br/>
its No drop he can&#39;t sell it.  My rogue used 1 HS weapons for completeness,<br/>
but only until he got Backstab.  Since then I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even touched<br/>
the FS Scimitar in the bank.  Very odd.  Are the fangs not No Drop as well?<br/>
