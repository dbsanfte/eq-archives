<div id="ygrps-yiv-792676716">ATK is made of two numbers, yes. The eq.castersrealm.com shaman forums<br/>
(as well as Shaman&#39;s Curcible and I think another) occasionally have<br/>
long discussons on the values of stats. Tumadorf is big on numbers and<br/>
tight analysis, well written and all around in the know.<br/>
<br/>
This thread contains a graph of 6 different strengths, from 55 - 228<br/>
showing not much more than random variance and a spike at the magic<br/>
number and 1 damage frequency as one would expect.<br/>

A somewhat ugly graphical representation surrounded by a nice text<br/>
analysis. It doesn&#39;t sit too well with me but I can&#39;t nail down why.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I see people commenting on is, why higher strength gives a<br/>
lower average damage and more hits for 1. Ugh, lower average damage<br/>
because of the hits for 1 and more hits for 1 because the +str bumps<br/>
them up from a 0 damage hit (miss). It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t always tell<br/>
the difference between an avoided miss and a mitigated 0 damage hit.<br/>
<br/>
Just as a point of curiousity:<br/>
How often do you, as a bard, get ridden for +str songs? I haven&#39;t gone<br/>
out of my way to use one lately except when I&#39;m smithing. After looking<br/>
at how little +str effects overall damage (unless in a really melee<br/>
heavy party) I stick with a haste effect (if no enchanter or I&#39;m not<br/>
busy doing everything else) or damage shields or dots depending on<br/>
situation. However, I&#39;ve only just hit 42 and haven&#39;t had a chance to<br/>
try out McVaxius&#39; yet so everything might change after I give it a<br/>
whirl.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; now, is atk like ac in that it is made of up 2 numbers, like chance<br/>
&gt; to hit, and damage<br/>
&gt; done, sorta like damage avoidance and damage absorption?  if so, then<br/>
&gt; real damage<br/>
&gt; applied would also have to increase.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; anyone got a good link to the analysis done on this? <br/>
