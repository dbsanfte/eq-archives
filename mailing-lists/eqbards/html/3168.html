<br/>
As you can see my vote has been cast with the chance of maybe one write-in (layering).  Just a thought, anyway I just wanted to share with all of the great fortune I had last night.  Its a long story, but worth it.  Bear with me.<br/>
<br/>
I was cruising around Misty Thicket last night (for the third straight day) in an attempt to earn that elusive squad ring.  After about my 300th Mooto (slight exaggeration) I became fed up with the whole process.  Along comes a wanderer from RunnyEye looking for directions to Freeport.  &quot;Ok, I&#39;ll take you&quot;, (I am just pulling my hair out with boredom here anyway) I thought to myself.  So off we went.  As we reached the West Freeport Zone, I heard an /ooc asking where the Bard&#39;s Guild was located.  In my best boy scout (think Dudley Do-Right), I told the unknown stranger &quot;I&#39;ll take you there!&quot;  Sound familiar?  Anyway, as I left my one &quot;Air-Weiland&quot; passenger on the steps of the gate, I picked up my second flight plan.  As bards, we all know how easy it is to get to Marsheart&#39;s Chords from the West Gate of Freeport.  Turn left, left, right, zone, u-turn around the wall, right, left, BOOM.  15 second run, with zone time!  Well it seems that this 20plus level  traveller just didn&#39;t want to waste his time hunting for it.  He was delivering mail.  So, upon our arrival, I told him about the Kelethin to Freeport bug and asked where are you delivering from and what type of package is it?  &quot;Guk,&quot; he replied, &quot;Its a letter.&quot;  &quot;That would go to Felicity, the packages go to Ton Twostring, just for future reference.  Well, good luck to you sir,&quot; I said as I moved out the door.  &quot;COME BACK HERE!!!&quot; he bellows, shaking me up just a hair (I&#39;m a pretty timid 13th lvl).  &quot;For your troubles,&quot; he says.  Then he gives me a pair of gloves.  &quot;Thanks very much,&quot; I say, assuming raw-hide or leather worth a few gp, not bad for a 15 second job.  But when I go to inspect them,<br/>
<br/>
ELF-HIDE GLOVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;WOW, Elf-hide?  I&#39;ve been looking for these!!!!  Thank you so much Mr. Monk Sir (his name was Shadon something)!!&quot;  I stammer incredulously.<br/>
<br/>
His reply, &quot;Ha ha.  Use them well, Weiland.&quot;  And then he disappeared into the streets.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly another McQuaid sighting?!?  <br/>
<br/>
We may never know for sure, but I have to say now that I will continue my good deed doing and retain my helpful demeanor!!  It sure paid off this time -- 3 or 4 AC (can&#39;t recall) +5 AGI +5 DEX for free.  And from what I&#39;ve heard on this list, they could go for quite a price if I ever found something better (yeah right).<br/>
<br/>
Take note of this, newbies.  It is the best advice I can ever give any other players.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Shadon, whoever you are!!!!<br/>

Very Happy 13th Level Bard<br/>
