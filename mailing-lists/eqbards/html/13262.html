<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557556562"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth of loot but<br/>
&gt; &gt;that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant &quot;makes<br/>
&gt; &gt;the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and the price<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wouldn&#39;t that be stupid - won&#39;t the price DROP when it&#39;s a more limited <br/>
&gt; weapon?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The existing yk&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be changed, we&#39;ve seen this happen with<br/>
Rubicite, Manastones, and Guise&#39;s.  If the lord started dropping warrior<br/>
only Ykesha&#39;s, and the existing ones were the only multi-class ykesha&#39;s in<br/>
existance, the price WOULD go through the roof.<br/>
