Wowwee, I have found a new home. &lt;subliminal message&gt;If you are on Povar<br/>
don&#39;t read this (unless you want to group with me :o)&lt;/subliminal message&gt;.<br/>
Paw is now a great dungeon for my level (27) and above. Great exp, fine<br/>
loot, big fun. Now, there was that part where I was trained while pulling,<br/>
got charmed, fought as a pet for a while, then when charm broke I was nuked<br/>
in one hit by a wizard. That was less fun, and frankly reminded me of a<br/>
relationship I was in for a while....But after that  things went great.<br/>
Since I solo&#39;d there at 10 with a shaman before the upgrade it strikes me as<br/>
all the fun of a low level dungeon, but at 27, which in my experience is<br/>
rare. Forget the Safe-N-Boring spire groups, if you are Danger Bard go<br/>
inside, it&#39;s like EQ used to be for me.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that a few days ago, but didn&#39;t send it. As of last night I have<br/>
some new info.<br/>
First of all guilds are doing sweeps in there which leaves very little lower<br/>
level spawn. A bunch of level 35-40 &lt;Runelords&gt; even decided to KS the<br/>
measly entry spawn the weakling level 27 bard was trying to solo, they were<br/>
absolute jerks about it, but as it only happened on two spawns one after the<br/>
other (setting me up for a really fun 10+  minute wait for more) I didn&#39;t<br/>
bother petitioning. Also, people wander in from SK all the time so it can be<br/>
frustrating if one pops and you aren&#39;t totally ready, you may get another<br/>
long wait for one little kill. Then again, a nice visitor can really save<br/>
the day :o)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, since I wrote the first bit they have apparently been tweaking Paw,<br/>
the entry Gnolls now cast fire shields on themselves (not really a problem<br/>
when doing all instrument attack) and, most oddly, now *poison* you quite<br/>
frequently. It is weak poison, but they are now tougher. Also, their magic<br/>
resist is high for their level.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: pull WAY back into the entrance hallway, when they run they run fast,<br/>
and binding doesn&#39;t always stick very well, even when they are near death.<br/>
If they pull you out to the big room (or the 3 Gnolls just past the<br/>
entrance) you will be dead. So give yourself LOTS of hall to play with, it&#39;s<br/>
worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, though Paw is one big long train track (with few safe spots) you<br/>
don&#39;t always have to bail when someone shouts train, just start doing a /who<br/>
PersonShoutingTrain and if they disapear from paw you are probably just fine<br/>
*grin* The longer they live the closer to the zone you should get.<br/>
