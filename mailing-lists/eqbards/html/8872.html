<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433939941">I heard of a bard friend having this problem on the weekend.  He had a<br/>
friend turn in the components for the Lambent gloves for him, and was<br/>
immediately attacked.  I didn&#39;t see this myself, so can&#39;t verify.<br/>

Something very much like this happened to me last night, causing me to<br/>
lose my level.  I turned in the crafted greaves components and got the<br/>
greaves and exp, and all the centaurs immediately attacked me.  Guides<br/>
said too bad, so sad so, I guess it&#39;s back to the birdhouse for me.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t attack (my attack key is f12, so I was nowhere near that) and I<br/>
didn&#39;t accidentally hit any area spells (the hotkey page I was on<br/>
didn&#39;t have any area spells on it).  Plus, they didn&#39;t attack my group<br/>
partner after I was dead.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to check if they were<br/>
still KOS to me, since I had my body dragged to the bridge and camped<br/>
after I got dressed.  I was not terribly happy that the guides<br/>
wouldn&#39;t res me after such an obvious bug, but with no way to prove<br/>
it, I guess they really can&#39;t do anything.  Anyone else have this<br/>
happen on other quests?<br/>
