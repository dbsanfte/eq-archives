<div id="ygrps-yiv-712463454">We were fortunate enough to have a guide in our group, as their non-guide<br/>
character obviously.  She sent in the call to get the GM to come witness the<br/>
problem and we did some pretty extensive tests to try to nail down the exact<br/>
problem.  We were able to determine that if I logged out and came back I was<br/>
no longer on the list, but as soon as I pulsed on the enchanter I was back<br/>
on every giant in the castle.    Very annoying.<br/>

Well thats lovely...  I hope having ultra negative faction won&#39;t hurt me...<br/>
<br/>
I have learned to ignore faction messages in kunark as I get them<br/>
constantly.  (But its not a bug according to the Veeshan Guides).<br/>
<br/>
In any case its still pretty darn annoying as I usually pull (most people<br/>
don&#39;t pull fast enough for my taste).  Especially against things that run<br/>
fast, like the giants...<br/>
