<div id="ygrps-yiv-195552809">I&#39;ve made the trip to qyenos many times from freeport.... IMHO runneye and<br/>
then the gorge are the easiest options.  from Freeport if you stay left and<br/>
on the cliff side watching the floor of the canyon carefully,  you should<br/>
have no problems... I&#39;ve never died making the triip and never had ti use<br/>
accelerando except on the last leg of the run to eastern Karanas.  I have<br/>
tried to go through High hold and have died twice while using selo&#39;s, plus I<br/>
get lost in there every time.<br/>

&gt; I keep hearing two opposing statements about travel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know I&#39;m fast, I can outrun a griffin (sometimes), but then I hear if<br/>
&gt; I want to go to Qeynos there are two options. Either RunnEye or High<br/>
&gt; Hold Pass. I hear in HighHold there are gnolls who will kill me and in<br/>
&gt; RunnEye I&#39;ll have 10 creatures trained on me. I don&#39;t like to train, nor<br/>
&gt; do I like to die. So please let me know, whats the safest way for a<br/>
&gt; level 10 Bard to travel from Freeport to Qeynos.<br/>
