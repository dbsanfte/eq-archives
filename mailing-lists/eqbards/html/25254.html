<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438107673">Heh, not quite that bad yet on Xegony. All three raids I&#39;ve been on<br/>
thusfar were pick-up raids. Don&#39;t think Xegony has a master calendar at<br/>
this point. Thanks for advice though. I know the dragons do go down fast<br/>
after a patch.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about Xegony, but on Tunare generally the dragons die within<br/>
12 hours of the servers coming up.&nbsp; That, and we use a reservation<br/>
type system (based on EzBoard) where leaders will sign up for entire weeks<br/>
such that they can lead given a patch day or a regular respawn and anyone<br/>
interested in joining the raid can contact them well ahead of time.&nbsp;<br/>
Oh, the dragons are booked months ahead of time on Tunare, too, just as<br/>
something to possibly look forward to dependent on your server.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
