<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-370641239">Well I completely understand and sympathize Talies, I cannot<br/>
tell you how often the same has happened to me - especially in Unrest and<br/>
Mistmoore!  When you come back, may I suggest killing aviak guards in Lake<br/>
Rathe or the undead camp in Rathe Mountains?  Both are more &quot;boring&quot; than<br/>
Unrest, but both also offer you the chance to get to at least 24 very<br/>
quickly and safely.  But until then, please enjoy the real world for me!  <br/>

				Actually, the first.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but<br/>
after spending the last 2 weeks<br/>
				gaining a half a bubble slowly over several<br/>
hours, only to lose it in an<br/>
				instant at LEAST 6 times a day - I just got<br/>
too frustrated.  I was trying<br/>
				to play by Brad&#39;s rules: group or die, so I<br/>
was grouping, everywhere.  Died<br/>
				3 times in a row in Unrest, and the only<br/>
support I got from my group was<br/>
				&quot;Dude, you&#39;re too low - you&#39;re gonna die if<br/>
you come back!&quot; (I was 22nd.)<br/>
				I gave up on groups and decided to solo, but<br/>
the very first pull, a simple<br/>
				Dark Boned Skeleton standing RIGHT at the<br/>
side door, went awry, when the<br/>
				skeleton somehow decided that the door was<br/>
not the shortest path to e, and<br/>
				ran through the entire house to get to me,<br/>
of course, bringing the entire<br/>
				house with it.  I just /quit&#39;d, didn&#39;t even<br/>
look back.  I can&#39;t play the<br/>
				game if I can&#39;t find a regular group, and<br/>
every group I find that is<br/>
				halfway decent soon outstrips me in levels,<br/>
so I gave up.<br/>
				  Enjoy it, and perhaps someday I&#39;ll be<br/>
back, but for now, I will be<br/>
				leaving for greener pastures.  At least,<br/>
single-player-friendly pastures.<br/>

<br/>
				P.S. I wasn&#39;t the only one to make this<br/>
decision in my semi-regular group.<br/>
				After dying 3 times in a row to trains other<br/>
groups brought over her in the<br/>
				space of 30 minutes, with NO opportunity to<br/>
gain experience before dying<br/>
				again... well... she decided to quit, too.<br/>
