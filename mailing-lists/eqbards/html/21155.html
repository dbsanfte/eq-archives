 I am pretty sure Slyde plays on the same server I do, Xegony. It is an old<br/>
server, one of the inital release servers. Thus there are Alot of high level<br/>
players, even third or more generation high level players. Getting a plane<br/>
these days on Xegony really begs for a web scheduling tool. We (Being<br/>
Excalibur guild) were invited to join one of the guilds we are allied with<br/>
for Hate the other weekend. That morning, we found is was broken and cleaned<br/>
by Havenlight or one of the other big guilds. Now some of our guild mates<br/>
are grousing that we rarely &#39;do&#39; anything since we&#39;ve lost a fair number of<br/>
members. (These were the same people angry a couple months ago our guild was<br/>
too big.) I have never been to fear, never really been asked to go even. You<br/>
almost have to be in one of the guilds that can do the break to get in on a<br/>
break. It has happened that an inexperienced guild has attempted a break,<br/>
only to find an &#39;uber&#39; guild waiting to take over once they give up. Planes<br/>
on Xegony is very much a matter of ownership. If Slyde got invited then he<br/>
really either had to go or risk not being invited again, no matter if it was<br/>
already broken or not.<br/>
I went to Hate once so far and I got the boots, BP, and Martune rapier as<br/>
sovernirs. The Maestro only dropped a monk mask, nothing for bards. I highly<br/>
recommend it if there are few or as in my case no other bards. Clerics love<br/>
bards and there are usually alot of clerics in hate. This is a great thing<br/>
as you will get rezed in pretty quick. Expect to die a few times even with<br/>
an expert pull team. It was fun, but long and yes even boring at times even<br/>
breaking.<br/>
