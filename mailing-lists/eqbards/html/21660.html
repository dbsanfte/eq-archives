<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762518553">in a group i&#39;ll sing celerity, chant of battle and manasong or regen. But i<br/>
will not only sing mana, any group that starts tellin me what to sing and<br/>
only sing can kiss my blue butt<br/>
<br/>
But i&#39;m probably gonna end up stayin in rathe mountains for a few levels so<br/>
means i&#39;ll make some nice cash while im there. I&#39;m allready up almost 1000pp<br/>
in gems, and i dont think i&#39;ll be leaving there till i have at least 2<br/>
stacks of 20 rubies, who knows i might stay till im 46 and with a full<br/>
backpack *shrug*<br/>

&gt;find giants there when other groups are camping them.  Mind you i still can<br/>
&gt;drop 3-4 of them before they pull their second one.  Another thing that is<br/>
&gt;great about them is they max lev at 37, which is same as our low lev charm<br/>
&gt;song so no need for mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyways, thanks for the suggestions to go kill the giants, and also thanks<br/>
&gt;for the suggestion on buying rubies with the cash and reselling afterwards<br/>
&gt;at a loss of about 10-12pp per gem (big deal).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lol. Good to hear Minkin! I am in the same boat as you. I usually can only <br/>
play for 1.5 to 3 hours tops and it&#39;s hard to find a group, get together, <br/>
find a hunting spot and hunt before I have to leave.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 40 as well and find the giant hunting a very nice alternative (I <br/>
have yet to get a forest loop from these stingy buggers), and the money is <br/>
pretty decent from all the tunics and various weaps I get off of &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
However, it can get to be a bit tedious after a while, so I&#39;ve journied to <br/>
City of Mist and am still getting pretty good experience as these groups <br/>
love having a bard. Not a great place during off hours, but I&#39;m going to <br/>
explore the emerald jungle area and see if I can charm/kite around there. <br/>
The trees will make it difficult, but I&#39;ll see if I can find a clearing <br/>
somewhere as I like to use 3rd person perspective when charming.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m on Bertoxxulous so CoM hunters may be different, but there usually <br/>
is only 1 or 2 groups hunting here, and it was fun to use my lament and <br/>
pull for the group, and charming the extra if we get 2 of them.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, at my current level I find that in a group during combat I&#39;m <br/>
either weaving Celerity and Arms with either mana/hymn (for groups with <br/>
more tanks than casters, also improves my melee skills which have waned due <br/>
to all my charm/kiting)or using my 2 chants (w/tambourine) with mana or <br/>
hymn. Kind of curious about what other bards like to weave in a group at <br/>
level 40. I agree with previous bards that throwing in manasong during <br/>
combat is more of a gesture than it is effective, but I refuse to just sing <br/>
manasong.<br/>
