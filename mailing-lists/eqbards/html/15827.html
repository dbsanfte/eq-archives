<div id="ygrps-yiv-189012443">Yes but once they entered into a contract they were obligated to uphold it<br/>
despite their misconception as to the legality of its clauses.  They could<br/>
deny access to the game, or the company, but they could not withhold any<br/>
real property gained as a result of the game or working at the company.<br/>
Therefore they could ban you and not let you play, but they&#39;d have to let<br/>
you sell your account as that was your real property bought and paid for.<br/>
That was the interpretation I was given anyhow as I thought the same thing<br/>
as you.<br/>

&gt; attorney gaming friend laid it out.  Interestingly as such, Verant also<br/>
&gt; cannot ban someone for anything they say while online.  Despite the fact<br/>
&gt; that it is in the TOS that you cannot say certain things without being<br/>
&gt; banned, US civil liberties laws specifically prohibit anyone from<br/>
&gt; voluntarily abrogating their own constitutional rights except in cases of<br/>
&gt; national security.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Verant is also a private company, and thus has the right<br/>
to deny access to the game to anyone they want.  I don&#39;t<br/>
recall the Supreme Court decision governing this (way too long<br/>
since I took the course), but basically there was a dispute as<br/>
to whether a private company could be forced via civil liberty<br/>
obligations into a legal contract they didn&#39;t want.  The<br/>
ruling was that it could not, although the government could<br/>
penalize it by witholding federal funding for that reason.<br/>
