<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323470133"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So you think paladins, rangers and shadowknights should also be able to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I see where you are going, these are all more of a melee class than<br/>
bards (as a side not, there is a shadowknight quest where they can get a<br/>
rechargable Bind Ring similar to the Squad Ring).<br/>
<br/>
The whole point of why I brought this bind issue was because I thought the<br/>
bind proposal was an interesting one, and one that could stimulate player<br/>
economy.<br/>
<br/>
To recap:<br/>
1) Bind would costs a lot of mana.<br/>
2) Group bind wouldnt be available until later levels.<br/>
3) Bind would require a zone specific foraged food item.<br/>
	-Item would have to be player made into another item (make it high<br/>
level)<br/>
	 similar to the rat pie for the paw of oppula.<br/>
	-Dont make all the items one specific trade, ex:<br/>
	  -E. Commonland - Foraged item: Sundergrass, made into: Sundergrass<br/>
Soup or <br/>
         something..<br/>
	  -Oasis - Dune Berries - Brewed into: Dune Ale<br/>
4) Bind/Group Bind required one reagent per group member, if not all<br/>
reagents are <br/>
   present, bind fails (Group bind would need 6 for all six), or make it a<br/>
random<br/>
   bind, 4 reagent = random 4 people get bound, similar to succor spells.<br/>
<br/>
5) Bind/Group Bind Costs the equivalent of Dying once at your current level.<br/>
This <br/>
   affects all personnel getting bound.<br/>
<br/>
6) Bind/Group Bind can only be sung once every 1-X days (TBD) similar to Lay<br/>
of Hands<br/>
<br/>
We are in the middle of the hybrid magic tree in my opinion:<br/>
<br/>
Top:<br/>
Druid<br/>
Shaman<br/>
Bard<br/>
Ranger<br/>
Paladin<br/>
Shadow Knight<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about this really makes me wonder, if were not as Hybrid enough of<br/>
a hybrid to get bind like the Druid and Shaman, why do our songs fall under<br/>
True Casting/Arcane arts rules? Selo for one under this thinking should work<br/>
fine inside.  Its like saying, a solar powered radio (druid/Shaman in this<br/>
analogy) will stop working when taken into a dark dungeon (hence, no light,<br/>
no power = hence, no force of nature - no power).  But take a Bard, singing<br/>
(equivalent to a battery powered radio), take him inside, and the analogy<br/>
falls apart.  The bard is relying on his own power (batteries/singing), not<br/>
dictated by loss of influence from a god, yet we cant work.  We know that if<br/>
you take away the light for the druid (nature), it wont work indoors, but<br/>
for the bard he takes his power with him.<br/>
<br/>
Im rambling, apparantly noone wants to hear this tripe anyway so Ill just<br/>
shut up.</div>
