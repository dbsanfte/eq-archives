<b>Subject:</b> Re: Bardic guild on Tunare <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-87969617"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m not on Tunare - but I&#39;m curious why you&#39;d want to be in a Bard-only<br/>
&gt; guild. In my opinion - the biggest advantage of a guild is to more easily<br/>
&gt; find people at similar level; to group with.  I have had some success in<br/>
&gt; larger groups with another bard; but the couple of times I&#39;d been in a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>group<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with two other bards - I felt I&#39;d have been better off with a more diverse<br/>
&gt; group.  I&#39;m a big proponent of &quot;combined arms&quot; tactics...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I rarely see groups of people all of the same guild adventuring together,<br/>
unless they&#39;re all 30+ and camping something.  I don&#39;t only think of guilds<br/>
as being groups of like-minded people, and such.  Why not have a guild that<br/>
is class specific?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been in a couple of guilds - and I actually like the fact that in my<br/>
&gt; current guild - I&#39;m the only bard (makes my services to be in very high<br/>
&gt; demand!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t been in any guilds.  I&#39;ve never even been asked to join one.  i<br/>
don&#39;t actively seek membership in one, either.  I never hear about any<br/>
guilds on Tunare.  Sure I see a lot of the names, but you never hear about<br/>
them recruiting, or holding events, etc.  The Sisterhood was the only guild<br/>
I&#39;ve ever seen to hold an event.  Maybe Tunare is just a bad server for such<br/>
things. &lt;shrug&gt;</div>
