 </span></blockquote>Yeah, just read that, that means I get to stay in Kunark till 19 or so when<br/>
I have to go dump all those saved training points into Hand to Hand. I am<br/>
not going to bother with sneak, unless someone here just raves about how<br/>
useful it is. I have never used it with Tszaaz.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I think it&#39;s time for Newbie Bard to come out of the closet *laughs*.<br/>
It looks like I am committed to playing him, and now that he is tricked out<br/>
in all my favorite pre-lambent armour the phase of figuring out how to get<br/>
started in a new world is pretty much over. So, if you see Tsengu, Wood Elf<br/>
bard on nameless running around, wave and say &quot;hi!&quot;. *smiles*<br/>

Tszaaz/Tsengu<br/>
