<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267320745">On Brell, it&#39;s East Commons - where the tunnel is.  I think that&#39;s pretty <br/>
standard though.  Also, I&#39;ve seen a lot of auctioning lately in the Lake of <br/>
Ill Omen, but not so much in other zones.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still a stagnant economy.<br/>

&gt;cleric currently is. She went from one bubble to 17 to 2 bubbles into 19 in<br/>
&gt;a few hours out there with just her and a rogue, same level. Of all the<br/>
&gt;things V does so wrong, I have to give them credit for doing a good job on<br/>
&gt;the zone size / spawn rate in zones like Ill Omen. There were 128 people in<br/>
&gt;the zone yesterday and we still had all we could pull.<br/>
&gt;General Interest Question: On Xegony, Greater Faydark is commonly known as<br/>
&gt;Faymart, where you can find any of your shopping needs. Is this the same on<br/>
&gt;other servers?<br/>
