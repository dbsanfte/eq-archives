<div id="ygrps-yiv-836852747">be ready for getting nuked alot. have guardian rythms and elemental rythms<br/>
ready at all times because yes the hags still do hurt<br/>
<br/>
My party was bored this weekend and we ended going to find out just where<br/>
the ghost spawns, we actually had to do an evac gate because everything just<br/>
got out of control for some odd reason and next thing you know the ghost<br/>
spawns on us. Needless to say all of a sudden our 2 bards were playing fear<br/>
song close to the gate casters hehe<br/>
<br/>
our party was:<br/>
bard 31<br/>
bard 38<br/>
druid 39<br/>
cleric35<br/>
cleric37<br/>
<br/>
but one thing that made the situation get out of hand here is that the druid<br/>
and one cleric had very big frame rate problems so they were rendered almost<br/>
useless. but we will go back and woop that dwarf some time.<br/>

&gt; Hello all- believe it or not, at level 28 I have yet to travel to quite a<br/>
&gt; few dungeons. Since I am currently in Kaladim, I thought I would give<br/>
&gt; Unrest<br/>
&gt; a try.<br/>
&gt; My questions are this: what songs should i be using primarily-both as a<br/>
&gt; battle bard and as a buff party bard?<br/>
&gt; My current machime though is only a p233 and weaving more than 2 songs,<br/>
&gt; maybe 3 on a good connection day, is about my max-2 being the norm for me.<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions and tips would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
