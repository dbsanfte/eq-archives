<b>Subject:</b> The horror of the mana song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-461053592">I&#39;ve been having an argument with my cleric of late. <br/>
<br/>
He claims that the mana song definately gives him mana with every pulse,<br/>
as opposed to being a song that last has a duration like most of our <br/>
other songs.<br/>
<br/>
At some point I had seen data from a timing test that someone had done<br/>
on this subject.  I remember it saying that it didn&#39;t matter whether the<br/>
mana song was sung repeatedly, or weaved with 2 others songs -- the mana<br/>
recover was the same.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone verify this?<br/>
<br/>
Can someone repost that fine research?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone up for duplicating it?  I need some independant research to take <br/>
to my cleric.  <br/>
<br/>
(He even went so far as to group with another bard and insult my singing<br/>
skills.  Yikes!)<br/>
