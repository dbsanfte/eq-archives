&gt; To recap, here is what I know about our resist buffs songs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)  Elemental and Purifying rhythms do not stack together<br/>
&gt; 2)  Guardian Rhythms will stack with Elemental or Purifying.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Need to confirm:<br/>
&gt; 1)  Do the rhythm series songs stack with the Psalm series?<br/>
<br/>

Vitality.  I haven&#39;t tested it with Purity or Mystic<br/>
Shielding.  The Psalm series does not stack with any other<br/>
Rhythm song.<br/>
<br/>
I was unable to get Psalm of Warmth and Cooling to<br/>
stack.  When your friend and you did it, did you get both<br/>
damage shields (10 points/hit at your level)?  Or did they<br/>
cancel each other out since one burns the opponent while the<br/>
other chills it?<br/>
