<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498461415">One small note that I&#39;ve made is the fact that the charm song now lasts<br/>
longer than three ticks occasionally.  There&#39;s one of three possiblities for<br/>
this.<br/>
1.  Level - It may be that as you level, as with other songs, Solon&#39;s tune<br/>
grows in strength ( ie duration of the charm)<br/>
2.  Charisma - I&#39;ve acquired two opalline earrings over the past 6 levels or<br/>
so, boosting my charisma by 10 points, so perhaps as with an enchanter<br/>
charisma effects duration of and resistance to charm<br/>
3.  Lag - ever since Rallos has moved to CerfNet or whatever isp currently<br/>
supports its connection, we&#39;ve been plagued with packet loss no less than<br/>
1.6 %  and occasionally as much as 30 %  all constant.  Could be it just<br/>
isn&#39;t updating the charm wearing off as quickly as in a lag free<br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was level 24, I inquired about this song on this list and<br/>
someone told me it only works on mobs 25 and under due to the relatively<br/>
recent charm changes.  That is not true, it works well with even red mobs<br/>
occasionally.  It&#39;s my only real defense against Hill Giants because, as you<br/>
had said, the range on this sucker is incredible.  Soon as a Giant gets<br/>
within bellow range, that&#39;s just about enough range for them to hit me.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing to note is, just as with any other charming spell, the mob<br/>
will not leave you alone once it&#39;s been charmed.  I&#39;ve twinked my friend<br/>
quite a bit with the help of this.  -=)</div>
