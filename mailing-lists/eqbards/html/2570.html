<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501171359">Combine? Did you say Combine? Hehe...Save your cash for a real nice weapon<br/>
like a Dragoon Dirk. I&#39;ve seen &#39;em as low as 20 plat, and as high as 200<br/>
plat. Best price you can get will most likely be found in Greater Feydark,<br/>
if not inside Crushbone itself. Now me, I managed to get lucky and get one<br/>
for free (A solo&#39;er managed to get the kill on Dvinn one night, and he<br/>
already owned a Dirk. Asked me if I wanted it... He didn&#39;t have to ask a<br/>
second time!). The dirk is better than ANY combine weapon except a Two<br/>
Handed Sword, but I can carry a shield, and get a Dex bonus as well.<br/>

&gt; It ranges 5-7 dm for me, and I find it quite useful.  I still cant decide<br/>
&gt; what to wield just yet.  I like my FS longsword cause with buff I often<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; 2 strikes, but the damage is hard to compare to my mino hittin for 17 a<br/>
&gt; swing.  A friend told me the FS longsword would probably be better in the<br/>
&gt; end since you get more swings in with the buff song goin the delay is alot<br/>
&gt; quicker than the mino.  I know these weaps dont even come close to you all<br/>
&gt; wieldin dirks and such but hey I&#39;ll get there someday.  At the moment I&#39;m<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the search for a combine longsword, scitmar perhaps.  Altough I know<br/>
bellow<br/>
&gt; is a single target spell, does it attract mobs in dungeons and caves?  I<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; some fighters complaing last nite that I was attracting them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Nah, I&#39;m playing a woodelf as well.  It usually does 7pts for me.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was tweaked since you first got it.  BTW, I love wood elves too much to<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt; any other race unless forced to (my next chrt is an enchanter, and I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; think wood elf is an option). I just love having forage & hide at lvl 1.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; And Bellow goes up a point in damage every other level or so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m curioius though why you&#39;re finding it does 7 points when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ve just gotten it.  If I recall correctly, it only did 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; points max when I got it.  Maybe wood elves have smaller<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lungs?<br/>
