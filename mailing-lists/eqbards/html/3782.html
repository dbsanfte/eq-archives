&gt; &gt;Most people don&#39;t realize it, but a lot of the enjoyment of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the game is the anticipation just before you loot something -<br/>
&gt; &gt;will it or won&#39;t it have a nice item?  I once modified the<br/>
&gt; &gt;source of an RPG so I could start off with the best stuff.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;It made the game really boring - the item drops didn&#39;t matter<br/>
&gt; &gt;because I already had the best stuff, so all that was left was<br/>
&gt; &gt;endlessly killing monsters for experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think though that if less emphasis were placed on gathering items and<br/>
&gt; accumulating wealth in EQ, more emphasis would be put on the social aspect<br/>
&gt; of it.  I hate to use UO as an example but in this case it serves as a<br/>
&gt; beautiful example.  It just had something EQ missed.  When you died you<br/>

purely social aspect.  There are no player-owned structures,<br/>
there are no player-owned merchants, there are no item sinks,<br/>
and there are very few money sinks (trade skills, steel armor)<br/>
most of which (trade skills) were an afterthought coded in<br/>
just before the game went Final.  In short, there really isn&#39;t<br/>
much you can *do* in EQ which doesn&#39;t revolve around killing<br/>
monsters to gain items and experience.  You can&#39;t really make<br/>
your mark on the world.<br/>
<br/>
The PvP and Racewar servers definitely have more<br/>
possibilities, but on the normal servers, socializing is not<br/>
much different from an IRC chat room.<br/>
<br/>
In that respect, UO is ahead of EQ.  I think EQ only strived<br/>
to make massively multiplayer online hack and slash FRPG.  UO<br/>
strived to make an online virtual world.  In the discussions<br/>
Brad McQuaid and Raph Koster have had, it&#39;s pretty obvious EQ<br/>
didn&#39;t have as high a goal as UO.  Brad still refuses to admit<br/>
that long-term money and item sinks are necessary in a<br/>
persistent online game, to keep player ability inflation (and<br/>
thus monster difficulty deflation) in check.<br/>
