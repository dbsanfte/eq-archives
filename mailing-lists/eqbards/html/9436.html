<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845894711"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; PoH was opened this weekend.  That was the reason for all the <br/>
&gt; undead all over the place and the GM events on all the servers<br/>
&gt; - PoH was opened and released hell spawn onto Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where did you hear this? The Plane of Hate hasn&#39;t been opened<br/>
yet. The surge in undead around the land was for Halloween. You&#39;ll<br/>
see things returning to normal now that it&#39;s over.</div>
