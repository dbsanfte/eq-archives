<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018821627">The bards on this mailing list tend to drool over Dragoon&#39;s Dirk (See DVinn<br/>
in Crushbone).  That&#39;s piercing.  I&#39;m only lvl 12 (and broke) so it&#39;ll be a<br/>
while before I get to play with that.  Can&#39;t help you much on melee skill<br/>
questions, though I kinda wish I had kept HTH up as well.<br/>
<br/>
As for songs ending abruptly, every time you&#39;re stunned (at least) your song<br/>
will end.  Some critters stun more often than others.  Skels are great at<br/>
stunning, so they&#39;re tougher than they look. :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just hit Level 6 last night (very happy to get the<br/>
&gt; Heal song :) Anyway I have been keeping up a number of<br/>
&gt; weapon skills. Since level 3 I have kept 1 hand slash,<br/>
&gt; 1 hand Blunt and Piercing all maxed. I have tried to<br/>
&gt; keep Hand to Hand maxed as well but it seems to raise<br/>
&gt; a few points each level and then stop. Does this skill<br/>
&gt; cap lower per level than the other weapon skills?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Second question is about being interupted while<br/>
&gt; playing. My only other character is a Rogue so forgive<br/>
&gt; me if my magic user references are wrong, don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; much about them :)  When I got my heal song I took off<br/>
&gt; after a skeleton that conned white to me. I was<br/>
&gt; interupted alot. This had not really happened before<br/>
&gt; at least not this much! Is Intstrument/Singing skill<br/>
&gt; what helps prevents Bards being interupted like<br/>
&gt; Channeling is to Magic user casting? If not what is?<br/>
&gt; BTW I beat the skeleton but was not pretty *grins*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Third (almost done :) on getting a new song about how<br/>
&gt; long is it level wise or skill wise before you can<br/>
&gt; count on playing that song well? Is there such a time?<br/>
&gt; Another thing that surprised me was that I mess up<br/>
&gt; playing that Heal song alot more than any of the other<br/>
&gt; songs I have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lastly I noticed when I bought my Drums at level 5<br/>
&gt; from the wood elf vendor she sold a Mandolin and Lute<br/>
&gt; as well. Is there a difference in these two for<br/>
&gt; playing purposes? Or are they just two options for<br/>
&gt; string instruments?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many thanks for the help and safe travels.<br/>
