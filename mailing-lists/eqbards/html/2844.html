basically worse than having no harassment guidelines at all.<br/>
If someone is being a jerk to everyone, it is not harassment.  <br/>
If someone tries to do something to the jerk to get him to<br/>
stop, it is harassment.  It&#39;s like ignoring random crime, but<br/>
jailing the people who try to stop the criminals.<br/>
