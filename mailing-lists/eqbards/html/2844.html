&gt; It *shouldn&#39;t* work if it&#39;s at a spawn site and they are camping...because<br/>
&gt; camping is completely legal...as is farming.  When whatever camped monster<br/>
&gt; spawns, it&#39;s totally up for grabs.  Just because the higher levels get it<br/>
&gt; every time doesn&#39;t make it a case of harassment.  It would only be<br/>
&gt; harassment if you moved to another location and they followed you, doing the<br/>
&gt; same thing :)<br/>

basically worse than having no harassment guidelines at all.<br/>
If someone is being a jerk to everyone, it is not harassment.  <br/>
If someone tries to do something to the jerk to get him to<br/>
stop, it is harassment.  It&#39;s like ignoring random crime, but<br/>
jailing the people who try to stop the criminals.<br/>
