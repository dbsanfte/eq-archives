charisma.  Putting on my two +5 charisma items reduced the price by around <br/>
40 plat.  I then got a friendly shaman to cast a charisma buff on me, <br/>
bringing my total up to 115; this brought the price down to less than 900 <br/>
platinum.  Sorry, I don&#39;t remember the exact figures.<br/>
