<div id="ygrps-yiv-782631547">When you cross the bridge and enter the tower - you almost immediately see a<br/>
ladder going up.  That is the &#39;supplier room&#39; (iirc) and both the supplier<br/>
and assassin spawn in there (keep your back to the wall - the froggies have<br/>
a mean back stab.)  <br/>
<br/>
When you go from the bedroom to the tower, you need to have invis to unded<br/>
but even so - the GDBS (bad skellys) will agro on you if you don&#39;t hug the<br/>
wall on the right hand side as you go by them. You cant merely waltz by<br/>
thinking your invis to unded will hold them at bay.  I have heard that 35ish<br/>
bards can lament them and pull singles. Or if you have 2 groups moving into<br/>
the tower and the bedroom is camped - you can just kill all them skellies<br/>
and be done with it.  The reason you don&#39;t go around the other way with<br/>
invis to unded is that there is live stuff there that could see and agro you<br/>
as well as unded stuff.  <br/>
