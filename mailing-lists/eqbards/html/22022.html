<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025407938">speaking of balance... you realize in beta bards were the only ones with<br/>
mana regen. They gave it to chanters so that chanters would actually be<br/>
played cause they sucked so badly in beta, they didnt even have half their<br/>
spells.  but that&#39;s another story...<br/>

Making the mez songs require an instrument isn&#39;t enough.  They&#39;re mez songs,<br/>
so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going<br/>
to be attacking anything anyway, which is the only thing that requiring an<br/>
instrument prevents us from<br/>
doing.  The problem is that Verant believes that the AE mez effect is too<br/>
powerful.  I don&#39;t know if they<br/>
feel it can be exploited (they seem to be incredibly hung up on the &quot;no<br/>
mana&quot; thing), or if this is just a<br/>
class balance thing between Bards and Enchanters, but they aren&#39;t going to<br/>
fix AE mez.  It will never<br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s disturbing to me are three things:<br/>
1.  Their testing indicates that the resists are lower than any of our<br/>
testing indicates, which suggests<br/>
that:  a) they&#39;re lousy testers or b) they have a different client or c)<br/>
we&#39;re all idiots.  Their<br/>
conclusion, of course, is going to be c), which means that they&#39;re going to<br/>
be pretty dismissive of<br/>
anything we say.<br/>
2.  They slapped the SAME secondary resist rate that they used to neuter the<br/>
AE mez song onto the single<br/>
target songs.  They seem to believe that this hasty, ill-thought-out<br/>
decision is pretty much fine, which<br/>
suggests a serious deficiency in their ability to balance Bard songs<br/>
appropriately (as if that isn&#39;t<br/>
obvious by now).<br/>
3.  They&#39;ve been promising for a month now to look into the single-target<br/>
mez songs at the first possible<br/>
opportunity, and even at that level of priority have not managed to get<br/>
around to it.  Abashi&#39;s post<br/>
suggests that they&#39;ve significantly lowered the priority level of this<br/>
testing, which means it is likely<br/>
to be a cold day in you-know-where before they get around to it.<br/>

&gt; I think this change is in line with the bardic theme, makes the songs a<br/>
