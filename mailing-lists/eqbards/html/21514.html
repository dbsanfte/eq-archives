<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111704942">I thought it was just me.  I was hunting Crags for silks yesterday and<br/>
thought it was just my new level that was making them run.  What a pain in<br/>
the rear.  As if I wasn&#39;t frustrated enough playing Chains, now it&#39;s twice<br/>
as needed.<br/>

&gt;before the patch, any Hill Giants ever did.  I do know there was some<br/>
&gt;sort of change, however, as Crag Spiders (ugh, more silks...) now run<br/>
&gt;when at low health where they did not this weekend. </span></blockquote></div>
