<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi, I was just wondering what people think about using a Polished Granite Tomahawk for a 1hslash weapon at lvl 35? I have a Silvery war axe,Barbed whip and Dirk right now also. The PGT has a lower dmg ratio than any<br/>
&gt; of the above mentioned weapons, but I kind of like the dmg barrier it provides for a limited time. My main question is whether or not the dmg barrier and extra strength negate the agility loss when it procs? My agil is base at 110 base and I have not bought mush agil increasing items. Thanks for any suggestions, I&#39;d like to hear what people think on the PGT.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not worth it.  I upgraded from a PGT to a silvery war axe.  Lower<br/>
delay, lower weight (stamina was becoming an issue after three gnoll<br/>
reavers in a row), and better look were all factors in why.  Also, I don&#39;t<br/>
rely on weapons for the procs they provide.  It&#39;s nice to have<br/>
invulnerability, but it tends to proc less when you need it, and last<br/>
shorter amounts of time against mobs that do more damage.<br/>
<br/>
Stick with the axe, fer sure, or upgrade to something else.<br/>
