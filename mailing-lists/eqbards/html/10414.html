<div id="ygrps-yiv-29360076">Well, if ya send another letter, PLEASE ask them to add a instrument slot<br/>
for us - much like folks using a bow - there is ALREADY a way for the<br/>
client to switch them out without having to manually juggle.<br/>
<br/>
Folks with weapons don&#39;t disarm to use a bow - casters don&#39;t have to disarm<br/>
to cast - why do WE have to disarm to go to an instrument?<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t mean to sound like I&#39;m disagreeing with you (I agree 100 pct) - but<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t really see the need for a petition.  As far as bards are concerned -<br/>
&gt;who&#39;d vote AGAINST it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We definitely should start think about sending another GZ letter - and this<br/>
&gt;belongs on it...<br/>
