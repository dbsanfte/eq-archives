<div id="ygrps-yiv-326213778">About a week ago - I guy I was grouping with in Befallen died.  When he<br/>
came back - the corpse wasn&#39;t in the exact spot he was in when he died (has<br/>
happened to me before).  But it was at a spot he couldn&#39;t get at (I&#39;m not<br/>
sure exactly where it was)..<br/>
<br/>
    At the time there were no guides or GM&#39;s on our server (Xegony) or the<br/>
chatrooms.  He was in a major panic.  Not sure the reason why - but he<br/>
logged out and into the game - and the corpse was m&quot;moved&quot; once again to an<br/>
accessible location.<br/>
<br/>
    This may be something worth trying especially on a busy time when the<br/>
guides take a long time to get back to you..<br/>
