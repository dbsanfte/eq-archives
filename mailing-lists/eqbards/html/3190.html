&gt; absolutely 100% certain how fast we were going.  She camped shortly after &<br/>

&gt; not Accelerado and I&#39;d swear to any of Norath&#39;s gods that I was moving<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Few things.<br/>
<br/>
Accelerando with a drum is faster than SoW.  If you had the<br/>
two stacked, then Accelerando (because it gets refreshed every<br/>
6 seconds) was taking precedence.  If you waited for<br/>
Accelerando to fade then zoned, then only SoW was in effect<br/>
and you were moving at the slower SoW speed.<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t want for Accelerando to fade and zoned, then you<br/>
had both effects up when you got through.  When Accelerando<br/>
faded, it put you at the unenhanced running speed, even though<br/>
the SoW icon was still up.<br/>
<br/>
The textures for different zones vary in resolution, and thus<br/>
give the illusion of moving at different speeds.  You will<br/>
notice the same thing if you play without SoW and Accelerando.<br/>
<br/>
I already mentioned that if you go through a zone with<br/>
Accelerando active, when you come out the other side it seems<br/>
to default to the base Accelerando speed (no drum, possibly<br/>
zero skill).  It&#39;s possible SoW also speeds up as the caster<br/>
levels, and zoning resets it to its slowest possible speed.<br/>
(If this is the case, and that&#39;s a lot of &quot;ifs,&quot; then the SoW<br/>
speeds in my timings are a bit off.)<br/>
