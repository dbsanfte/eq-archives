<div id="ygrps-yiv-250722601">Grim isnt too bad, i&#39;ve outrun him wehn i pulled a griffon and a griffawn<br/>
and he decided to jump me....   ever see a smurf run by at light speed?  We<br/>
almost had him but he kept resisting my snare, i had to charm him and get<br/>
him to sit down so my wiz friend could zone<br/>
<br/>

clippin plane maxed out in Lesser Fay<br/>

&gt; Hmm, my run thru Kith was in day time hours.  What is in Kith for 30+?  I<br/>
&gt; thought the Invasion was a one time thing for the PoH debut.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for faster than anything in Norrath, have you raced Grimfeather lately?<br/>
&gt; Granted he&#39;s not in Kith but he&#39;s faster than my MM drums.  Also,<br/>
&gt; Shadowmen<br/>
&gt; are faster as well - I have heard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What fun is it if you are not scared? (The whole game I mean.) <br/>

&gt; 		Kithicor scary?? Errr.....I always thought Kith was pretty<br/>
&gt; damn boring. As<br/>
&gt; 		for scary, who is scared when you are running faster than<br/>
&gt; anything else in<br/>
&gt; 		Norrath can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Kith rocks now. Great outdoor zone for lvl 30+. It&#39;s about<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
