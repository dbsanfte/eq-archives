&gt;Hello fellow loremasters!<br/>

<br/>
Truly, I killed darkweeds in E. commonlands from end of 9 through 14,<br/>
they&#39;re as common as, well, weeds.  I think spawn points spawn a<br/>
variety of creatures, and one in the northwest corner of E.C. produces<br/>
DW snakes along with others.  Since barely anyone hunts the<br/>
snakes, they become the predominant mob in that area.<br/>
They are all over the northwest corner.  I used the mountain<br/>
behind the inn as a place to fight them.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem is that if you solo them, the poison really boosts<br/>
your downtime, with a cleric buddy though.....<br/>
<br/>
With luck you&#39;ll get a Giant snake fang (4g6s to an npc) or venom<br/>
sack (4g6s).  Every once in a while I&#39;ve gotten 1 of each or 2 of one<br/>
on the same snake, as good a haul as a lightstone, without the need<br/>
for a magic weapon.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 14, and I&#39;ve just &quot;moved&quot; to the west coast.  In the last 3 levels<br/>
I&#39;ve put away 93pp in the bank.  Now I have to decide on exactly how to<br/>
spend it (how much on banded, whether or not to buy a magic weap yet,<br/>
and if so what)<br/>
