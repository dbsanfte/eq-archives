<b>Subject:</b> Gypsy Lute? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-659568635">So it appears there is a Lute of the Gypsy Princess and now a Gypsy Lute.  The screenshot of the gypsy lute says +5 Sv Magic which makes me want one simply for that fact.  I&#39;d be curious if anyone gets their hands on this, if maybe this is the equal to the Mistmoore Battle drum (I know this is probably just a fantasy. . . but hey, this is a fantasy game huh? =).<br/>
<br/>
Now as to this lute in relation to the quest.  I do not know where the Gypsy Lute comes from except one a person said, &quot;off a named gypsy musician&quot;.  I do not know if this person is in Mistmoore.  I would hope so.  The quest [clue] of &quot;a Gypsy Lute from the Castle of Mistmoore,&quot; is otherwise wrong.  And while EverQuest is an amazing game, we&#39;ve all had our own experiences with Verant that a mistake like this wouldn&#39;t surprise us.  I just hope they reimburse Shada and others that encountered this.<br/>
