<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996978943">No way to fix it.  Egroups made the change.  You can pay to have it not<br/>
appear, but I don&#39;t know anyone who has gone that route yet.<br/>
<br/>
btw  The main thing you missed was the huge uproar over Verant&#39;s claim that<br/>
Lullaby was just fine.  Many bards have left for other lands and I shall<br/>
soon be following.  Even Lyrnia has retired which suprised me greatly.  If<br/>
even Verant&#39;s staunchest supporters are outraged then things are worse than<br/>
I imagined.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you had fun in Dalnir&#39;s Tani, be well.<br/>

Ok and hmm replying to my own message, all of a sudden the sponsor stuff is<br/>
at the top of my emails.  Is this a change or is it cuz i upgraded to<br/>
Outlook 2000?  If its the latter, anyone know how to fix it?</div>
