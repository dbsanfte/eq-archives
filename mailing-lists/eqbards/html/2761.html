<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958259371">I talked to Crip of the FoH last night, another level 50 bard, and I asked him<br/>
about the new song Verses of Victory.  He told me that it is a song which<br/>
provides 30 str and 30 agi to your group.... now thats a damned nice buff if<br/>
ever I&#39;ve seen one.<br/>

&gt; Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt; My guild is on new bard watch for me now, and they reported a bard in Halas<br/>
&gt; bank. I did the Qeynos to HighKeep to Freeport runs last night and started<br/>
&gt; back again. I am making a list of names and locations as I go and will post<br/>
&gt; it as a spoiler maybe when I am reasonably sure it&#39;s complete.<br/>
&gt; Also, Xegony has a L50 bard now. I will try to ask him some of the questions<br/>
&gt; we talk about, what songs does he use most, what equipemnt does he prefer<br/>
&gt; etc, when I see that he is somewhere he can talk. He was in gukbottom last<br/>
&gt; night when I noticed he was 50, not a cozy spot to stop and chat. Is anyone<br/>
&gt; interested in this enough for me to post his answers?<br/>
