<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] That wurm guy in BW... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130524453">it is currently bugged.  Nezekezena is the wurm, he spawns around the 4<br/>
pillar structure near the crater and roams between there and the FM zone.<br/>
unfortunately he is dropping nothing at this time, he is supposed to drop<br/>
wurm guts for bards and burning embers for mages.  there is a wurm named a<br/>
Sarnak Extremist that is dropping the guts instead.  he is a wurm instead of<br/>
a sarnak.  we killed about 10 of each yesterday and got no embers so who<br/>
knows it may still be screwed, or maybe the embers are super rare.<br/>

&gt; fellow... who is<br/>
&gt; also used for the bard quest as I understand it.  Anyone know <br/>
&gt; its spawn<br/>
&gt; time/ path or a website I can get it off of?<br/>
