<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026930432">I agree with you that they can get pretty touchy, but look at the outright<br/>
hatred they get on the boards.  They addressed Bard Taunt and got a barely<br/>
audible murmur of approval or thanks.  They change an animation which is a<br/>
trivial thing, and get 5 new hate threads on how they suck in the EQ boards.<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, but how many zillions of false complaints do you think they get<br/>
every day, like the Necro Pet Stealth Nerf that never happened.<br/>
<br/>
Sure they could be better, but I&#39;d have gone berserk by now :)<br/>
