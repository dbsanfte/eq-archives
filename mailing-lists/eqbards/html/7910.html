<div id="ygrps-yiv-651515793">I&#39;d be more than happy to die once or twice for the privilege.  The normal<br/>
levels to hunt there are so far off for me losing even an entire level would<br/>
pale in comparison.<br/>
Think not that I will be turned aside so readily.  I&#39;m already planning on<br/>
heading over there for heart spiders for silk, I&#39;ll try hanging out again<br/>
and watching the /who&#39;s for groups going in.  I kicked myself for not<br/>
begging the 46th level wizard I made a bunch of silk armor for to help me<br/>
out he was very nice and probably would have, DOH!<br/>

&gt; I have yet to kill a froglok so my faction with them should be<br/>

<br/>
Your faction with the live frogs starts at the bottom of<br/>
dubious.  Killing 1 or 3 frogs puts you at threatening, which<br/>
is KOS if you stand next to them too long or they see you<br/>
fighting (say, gators or spiders).  However, killing undead<br/>
froggies raises your faction with the live ones.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This should allow me to safely go whereever the spawn is for the Guise and<br/>
&gt; pay someone to let me loot it.  Anyone have a idea of how much I should<br/>
&gt; offer for the looting rights? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s on the undead froglok side.  Good faction with the live<br/>
frogs will do nothing for you there.  We had two parties<br/>
heading towards the spot together (10 people total, levels 30<br/>
to 42) and unfortunately got a train run through us.  It<br/>
passed completely through us, but we knew it was coming back<br/>
when the people conducting the train either died or zoned, and<br/>
frantically started to invis-to-undead everyone.  We didn&#39;t<br/>
finish it in time.  One of us got attacked, after which people<br/>
dropped their invisibility to defend him, and all hell broke<br/>
loose.  Only 3 of us made it out alive.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun.  :-)<br/>
