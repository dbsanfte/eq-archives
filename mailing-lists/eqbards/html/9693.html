<div id="ygrps-yiv-353294072">Anyone that feels like taking a few minutes tonight, please test your songs <br/>
and note the effects.  If you have a willing friend test the damgage songs <br/>
as well. Then send the results to my email address(not the list).  With <br/>
enough data points I should be able to add formulas to the Song Analysis.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
