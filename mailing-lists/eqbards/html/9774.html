<b>Subject:</b> RE: Value of lambent stones (was AC Dilemma) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180371842">I wholeheartedly agree - we bards need to refuse to pay more than 20pp for a<br/>
Lambent Stone.  I have several pieces of Lambent now and have hunted for all<br/>
but one of the stones.  The one stone that I did purchase I purchased<br/>
because it was getting late and the HGs were being stingy with the Lambents.<br/>
I wanted the gauntlets before I logged, so when I saw someone auctioning one<br/>
for 25 I went ahead and bought it because I needed to be civil at work the<br/>
next day ;)  If it hadn&#39;t been late I would&#39;ve either dickered them down,<br/>
waited for one at 20pp, or gotten one myself.<br/>

&gt; With all due respect, this is why some jerks ask 100+pp for<br/>
&gt; Lambent stones-I<br/>
&gt; paid 10pp for a Lambent, the other 2 I have gotten so far were<br/>
&gt; given to me.<br/>
&gt; I refuse to pay more than 20, but when other bards pay 50, 60, or more for<br/>
&gt; one it makes it harder to get the message across.<br/>
&gt; My advice to you would be to be patient, you will find them for<br/>
&gt; 20 pp, or I<br/>
&gt; believe there are enough kind souls who will /shout looting rights to one.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I payed 60pp for a Lambent stone last night (was asking 100pp),<br/>
&gt; I also got<br/>
&gt; &gt;myself 2 sapphires and now all I need is the rune from Choon in<br/>
&gt; WK. Anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;know hard this is to get, bearing in mind I am only level 27. My friend<br/>
&gt; &gt;will help me kill him (level 28 Mage) so I think we could take him, can<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone tell me how hard Choon is to locate??<br/>
