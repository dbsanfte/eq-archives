<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300710112">Another point worth repeating here - it SEEMS that Selo&#39;s is slower in<br/>
certain zones - and I wondered about that for a long time until someone here<br/>
mentioned (my apologies I forget whom) that the textures in different zones<br/>
cause movement to appear differently and hence you SEEM to be going<br/>
slower...<br/>
<br/>
As they say - appearances can be deceiving..<br/>

&gt; This is something I&#39;ve also noticed, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Verant<br/>
purposely<br/>
&gt; slowing us down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it has more to do with lag, and number of users in a zone. I know<br/>
&gt; when I am in a zone with few players, I zip over hills and dunes as<br/>
thought<br/>
&gt; I were flying a Snowspeeder from Empire Strikes Back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the minute I hit a zone with 90+ people in it, it sure does seem like<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s loses some of it&#39;s gas.<br/>
