<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072732773">I agree with many of these suggestions especially the &#39;fix the Z axis <br/>
     bug&#39; one.  I have one of my own<br/>
     <br/>
     1.  Since Verant rants about how this game is designed for parting  <br/>
     they need to improve the desirability of haveing a bard in a party.  <br/>
     Now that I have learned about the enchanter speed spell line I now <br/>
     understand why it is sometimes very difficult to find a party that <br/>
     wants a bard when you go to a new zone where your not known.  I <br/>
     personally felt that the attack speed buff we provided from anthem, <br/>
     celerity etc should be one of our main attractions.  Since the <br/>
     enchanter buffs are better this is no longer the case.  (  <br/>
     <br/>
     SO... replace one the of late teens/early twenties songs with a toned <br/>
     downed version of the 32 level mana song.  Maybe half as effective as <br/>
     the 32 level song.  This would definitely solve the, what good are <br/>
     bards for, problem between about 15th and 32 level.<br/>

I read a post about starting back up the bard petition.  I for one do not <br/>
like petitions but for some strange reason that seems to be the way to get <br/>
things fixed with this game.  So I wrote the original writer of the Bard <br/>
petition and he wrote me back saying &quot;If you rally some people to make new <br/>
comments, I will overhaul it and submit it to Brad&quot;.  The ball is in our <br/>
court so I was hoping to see a bunch of new comments on things we would like <br/>
to have fixed or changed with the class.<br/>
     <br/>
On a personal note my Bard character is my favorite to play, and believe it <br/>
or not on the Magician mailing list everyone there complained a lot more <br/>
about there class.  I have to say though that my Mage character was a lot <br/>
more balanced than my bard.  And yet they keep helping the Mages out by <br/>
fixing their complaints.  Maybe the squeaky wheel does get oil.<br/>
     <br/>
Suggestions:  As my bard is still new I can offer only a few ideas to get <br/>
the ball rolling.<br/>
     <br/>
1.  Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  My idea is <br/>
change the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to me (Stats <br/>
might be the factor) to be the better song to use over Warsong and Anthem. <br/>
I have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, there should be <br/>
no debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>
2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>
3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rouges <br/>
do.<br/>
4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand <br/>
point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a <br/>
coin.<br/>
5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was not using a <br/>
crossbow or bow?<br/>
6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only weapons that can be <br/>
used as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of <br/>
singing songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a lot of ideas <br/>
here would help.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
I hope this gets the ball rolling and as viewed as a constructive way to <br/>
help solve some bard issues.<br/>
     <br/>
Fair thee well friends!<br/>
