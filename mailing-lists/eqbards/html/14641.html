<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617972036">One of my best friends, RL, is a lvl 50 bard on Solusek Ro. I KNOW how<br/>
much effort she put in to get there. ALL last year. I also know I am<br/>
not willing to put that kind of time into the game. I do not envy the level<br/>
50s, though I do feel left out on occasion. I realize that is, indeed, a<br/>
matter<br/>
of how much effort they were willing to put into the game, in comparison.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do know that I am unsure about /tell&#39;ing people that<br/>
high, unless I know them in particular. Because I do not want<br/>
to be seen as one of those annoying lower levels always bothering,<br/>
etc.<br/>

&gt;&gt; 45+ to get invited on a dragon raid.  By the time you get to that level a<br/>
&gt;&gt; few months down the road, the expansion will likely be out.<br/>
&gt;Lets say in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; expansion Verant raises the level cap to 75.  So by the time us non 45+<br/>
&gt;&gt; people get to 45th level, the current level 50s will be fastly<br/>
&gt;approaching<br/>
&gt;&gt; 75.  You have to assume that a lot of these 75 people will still go on<br/>
&gt;&gt; dragon raids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Purely speculation on my part, however, I don&#39;t think the new level<br/>
&gt;  limit is going to be L75, I think maybe L60 at most.  And that each<br/>
&gt;  consectutive level is going to be a hell level.  The fact is Verant<br/>
&gt;  can barely meet the needs of today, how on earth are they going to<br/>
&gt;  make 25 more songs, when they cannot even finish off 3 of our missing<br/>
&gt;  ones.  An extra 25 levels means 4 more circles of spells per class.<br/>
&gt;  Those extra levels mean new melee based skills.  Frankly, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  think they have the time to do it.  They haven&#39;t gotten it right<br/>
&gt;  today, I don&#39;t think they will get it right tomorrow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Now to apply that to the issue at hand.  You L25 people, you L35<br/>
&gt;  people, you will be L50 in what 6 more months? 9 more months?<br/>
&gt;  Who cares?  Live up the game to the fullest that it has to offer<br/>
&gt;  you at your current level.  Dragons are just a massive deathtrap.<br/>
&gt;  When the expansion comes out, based on what I&#39;ve said, you&#39;ll find<br/>
&gt;  that you still have plenty of time to build your character to a<br/>
&gt;  level where you finally catch up to the people who are doing<br/>
&gt;  the big things and you will not be excluded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I see a lot of people bash L50s because they are &#39;powerlevelers&#39;<br/>
&gt;  and they &#39;don&#39;t understand the fun of the game&#39;, yet I turn around<br/>
&gt;  and see those same people whining because they aren&#39;t allowed to<br/>
&gt;  go to the planes, or aren&#39;t allowed to be on a dragon hunt.  I<br/>
&gt;  put in way too many hours to get where I did.  That said, I have<br/>
&gt;  been to and seen 90% of Norrath, and I&#39;d say 75% of it I know<br/>
&gt;  like the back of my hand.  I still see L50 players get lost, but<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve explored, I&#39;ve roamed, I play with and help out the people<br/>
&gt;  who need it.  But damn I&#39;m a L50 so I have no idea what it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  like being L25, or shit he&#39;s L50 he won&#39;t talk to me or he won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  help me out.  This bard doesn&#39;t fit that stereotype, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  You see us talking about cool things, or you see us ego boosting<br/>
&gt;  it&#39;s because we worked hard to get this far.  I don&#39;t immediately<br/>
&gt;  turn on people because they are &#39;green&#39; to me.  I cannot even list<br/>
&gt;  the things I&#39;ve done for countless people in different areas of<br/>
&gt;  the world.. it&#39;s too staggering.  One guy even said &#39;Wow, I thought<br/>
&gt;  you Level 50 people just ignored people like me.&#39;  That makes me<br/>
&gt;  feel damn proud when I hear things like that.  I play non-anonymous<br/>
&gt;  every night, and I answer every single line of purple text that<br/>
&gt;  arrives on my screen.  I don&#39;t need to /who the person and figure<br/>
&gt;  out who they are or what level they are, I answer everyone with<br/>
&gt;  the upmost respect regardless of their EQ ranking.  I got at least<br/>
&gt;  10 tells last night related to bard songs, bard quests, bard info.<br/>
&gt;  And I&#39;m happy to help people out in any way I can.  I made 5 new<br/>
&gt;  friends in permafrost last week, when me and a friend helped these<br/>
&gt;  people clear out the king room whlie getting them exp and quest items.<br/>
&gt;  Just yesterday I handed out a full suit of bronze to a L10 warrior.<br/>
&gt;  Two shaman were watching us kill ice giants and cheering us on,<br/>
&gt;  so I handed each of them 25pp.  Why?  Because I&#39;m a f*ing nice guy,<br/>
&gt;  that&#39;s why.  I know exactly how hard it is to be L5, L10, L15, ...<br/>
&gt;  I was there, I suffered through those times.  I was broke, I wish<br/>
&gt;  I had suchandsuch an item.  I&#39;ve been where all of you have been.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think the best way Verant can solve this problem for those of<br/>
&gt;us currently<br/>
&gt;&gt; not high enough to go on a dragon raid (if they even consider it<br/>
&gt;a problem),<br/>
&gt;&gt; is that once the expansion comes out, put a maximum level limit<br/>
&gt;to zone into<br/>
&gt;&gt; Permafrost or Sol B.  Kind of like a reverse Plane level limit.  If they<br/>
&gt;&gt; limit entering those zones to level 50s and below , then they<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; worry about level 75s coming in and easily killing a dragon.  They also<br/>
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have to worry about continually making dragons tougher.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  That&#39;s sort of extreme, but I wouldn&#39;t mind them blocking specific<br/>
&gt;  dungeons in the reverse like that.  However, lots of items for quests<br/>
&gt;  drop in so many different places, it&#39;s so hard to exclude that broad<br/>
&gt;  a range of people.  They need to impose the yield rule and enforce<br/>
&gt;  it in a more strict manner.  I will never try to steal exp spawns<br/>
&gt;  from a player if it can be helped.  Although, I do not appreciate<br/>
&gt;  lower level players busting in on me if I&#39;ve been waiting on something<br/>
&gt;  for several hours.  That rarely happens, in fact I&#39;ve never had an<br/>
&gt;  item/mob conflict with any lower level person ever.  Then again I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;  not usually camping things, I&#39;m out kicking ass and taking names.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  blah blah blah... I talk to much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Bottom line, Level 50 players aren&#39;t always what you may think and<br/>
&gt;  you will be there one day and you will have all the fun we are<br/>
&gt;  having trust me.<br/>
