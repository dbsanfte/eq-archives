<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-5696324">It used to happen many months ago and I&#39;ve seen it resurface lately. This<br/>
thing nails me at least 60 times an hour. In combat I often twist 3 songs,<br/>
Warsong, DDD, Chains. If there is very little lag I tend to hit Warsong just<br/>
as it is coming down. What is happening is that the server indicates that it<br/>
is coming down. The client then indicates that it is going back up. The<br/>
server, thinking that the client is trying to cheat or something, demands<br/>
that it is coming down and drops the song effect. (okay, so that&#39;s not<br/>
exactly what it is thinking. :)<br/>
	When I get this a lot I often switch to a 4 song rotation to ensure that<br/>
the first song is down for a few seconds before it has a chance of coming<br/>
back up. Sure, I am not under the influence of Warsong for about 3 seconds<br/>
but that is better than not being effected for 10 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
	Worst song effect to have this happen: Selo&#39;s :)<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Twisting bug?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed the following recently while twisting songs. I&#39;m soloing and<br/>
singing Chant/Chains/Hymn and found that sometimes, just as the Chant or<br/>
Hymn is about to expire I get the following:<br/>
<br/>
You whistle an ancient warsong.<br/>
You stop whistling.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, my song kicks in just before it the buff expires, but still<br/>
expires shortly afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else know about this as a bug?<br/>
