<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-378053900">Uhhmmm I don&#39;t think anyone contested this particular fellow aquiring of<br/>
the item.  If fact a good amount of advice was spawn from his question.<br/>
What your seeing now is not the evaluation of him twinking, rather it has<br/>
evolved into a debate about the merits of  twinking.  This thread spawned<br/>
due to the two courses of actions suggested by the list.  If you look back<br/>
you will find that at no time did we accuse him twinking though we were<br/>
all a bit envious =).  I guess it is time to shange the topic.<br/>

&gt; OK. Let me start off by saying I too dislike twinking. That said, THE CHARACTER<br/>
&gt; IN QUESTION GOT THE ITEM WITHIN THE RULES OF THE GAME BY DOING A QUEST! How is<br/>
&gt; that a twink? He got the item fair and square so shouldn&#39;t it be his to do with<br/>
&gt; as he wishes?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jeez people, crawl down off your soapbox once in a while.<br/>
