<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407134650">Interestingly I have far less trouble with spellcasters than I do with equal<br/>
conning bruisers.  I take three bubbles of damage against a blue Legionnaire<br/>
minimum, two or less if against a blue Oracle.  Course, they don&#39;t get off<br/>
very many spells with me hitting them with Crookstinger sped up even more by<br/>
warsong or Anthem.  I&#39;ve seen green oracles kill warriors with 2hdd swords,<br/>
while I at a leel lowere could kill the same oracle and take less than a<br/>
bubble.  Speed really does kill casters.<br/>

    I find that the ability to solo Blues or whites depends entirely on the <br/>
monster.  Some blues are easy (beetles, lions, orcs) while others are almost<br/>
<br/>
sure death (aviaks, most spellcasters, undead reavers)  The classic example<br/>
of <br/>
this is bandits.  A blue fighter type bandit was easy pickings but a blue<br/>
spell <br/>
caster bandit was death.  I usually learn this the hard way...  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Playing style, yes. Character race, no. I too am a wood elf and I am still <br/>
soloing effectively at level 16. At this time I can take on 2 risky&#39;s or 1 <br/>
dangerous enemy and come out with at least 2 bubbles of healt left. And when<br/>
I <br/>
hit 17 and get dual wield I feel that will give me the extra boost to be<br/>
able to<br/>
solo into the low 20&#39;s or so.<br/>
     <br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I group with friends whenever they are around, but our <br/>
schedules don&#39;t always mesh so I&#39;ve learned how to solo too.<br/>
