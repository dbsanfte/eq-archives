<br/>
Someone said a couple days ago that a L50 enchanter said IG&#39;s don&#39;t mez. <br/>
Alot of our guild decided to have a mass IG battle in Perma Monday night and <br/>
our L45 enc was along. I asked her what success she had, here is her reply:<br/>
<br/>
Actually group mes didnt work well. I DID mes the<br/>
spooky spider, but you guys decided to fight it 1st<br/>
LOL.<br/>
<br/>
As for the giants, I worked with single mes, spell<br/>
called Entrance. AND IT WORKED. Mebbe just for a short<br/>
time, but it worked, cuz I received a note &#39;IG has<br/>
been entranced&#39;, which is always good to hear.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We still got wiped out en-mass, not sure if it was the IG priest or the <br/>
Kings room goblins repoping that was the death stroke.  Initial pull netted <br/>
3 IGs and an IG priest and one of the big spiders, for at least 3 groups of <br/>
L30s up to a couple 50&#39;s. We definitely need practice coordinating between <br/>
groups too. But we had one heck of a great time anyways!<br/>
