Vox has multiple Ice Giant guards, along with Icy Terrors (nasty high level <br/>
tentacle terrors), Giant Wooly Spiders, and Giant Dire wolves (frost wolves <br/>
- whatever). Most of the time those do not come alone.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve dont the Lord with just one group of 45+ - 1 cleric, 1 bard, 1 <br/>
enchanter, and some tanks. Course the enchanter made all the difference. <br/>
Normally you&#39;ll gather a truckload of Barbutes before you score a Yak, but <br/>
it&#39;s nowhere near as bad or frustrating the rare loot per kill ratio that <br/>
the frenzy spawn is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping to get a PoH raid going tonight with some friends. Maybe score <br/>
some 1mbru3d! (at least). I&#39;m just worried about the new patrollers that <br/>
roam into the gate-point. It&#39;s bad enough that half the stuff you pull will <br/>
take the scenic route to get to you (especially the stupid revultant rats) <br/>
pulling mass trains of friends to you along the way. Verant obviously <br/>
decided they don&#39;t give a shit about pathing errors, but dammn - way too <br/>
many people with neato Hate gear! Let&#39;s screw them harder than we ever could <br/>
with our merely sh*tty pathing AI...<br/>
<br/>
I hate to have anything to do with exploiting - but since they screwed us <br/>
I&#39;m considering having a naked person that can afford to die train all the <br/>
crap away from us to the other side of the zone (assuming he MIGHT make it <br/>
that far) so that the mobs will take their time getting back to their spawn <br/>
points. I&#39;m thinking a cleric with Rune IV that Auras when the rune runs out <br/>
may work. Course Rune IV is like a paper suit in Hate...<br/>

&gt;I met a high level necro on our server, Shada;) It is how I got my Icy<br/>
&gt;greaaves in Perma last night.<br/>
&gt;IT was only, him, I, and Aranlas in PErmafrost. He solo&#39;d his way through<br/>
&gt;permafrost with that awesome pet of his, cleared out the king room, and ICe<br/>
&gt;giant diplomat, leaving carnage and bodies in his wake. there were about 6<br/>
&gt;pair of icy greaves that went to waste;)<br/>
&gt;His name was Osiriz or some such.. I was hoping he would go deeper in, so I<br/>
&gt;could get a glimpse of Vox;)<br/>
