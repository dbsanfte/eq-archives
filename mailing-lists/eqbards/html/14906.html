<b>Subject:</b> Missing Songs!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-303887360">I was just sitting here wondering about our missing songs, as I am coming<br/>
up to level 39 and have nothing to look forward to I thought about creating<br/>
this post to see what you all thought.<br/>
<br/>
What I thought would be a good idea is if we all came up with suggestions<br/>
for songs and chose the best ones (via a vote). We could then post these<br/>
suggestions on the EQ forum notice boards and prehaps Verant will consider<br/>
these as ideas for our missing songs (or for the update). I think if it was<br/>
a formal post that has come from this list it may be taken seriously. The<br/>
post would not be a rant just a suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion for songs would be:<br/>
<br/>
Level 39: Invis to Undead (useful in Lower guk etc)<br/>
Level 45: An upgraded Bellow/DD song (giving us better combat skills)<br/>
Level 47: Summon Corpse song (like the necro one)<br/>
Level 49: Upgraded older song (such as charm) or a combo song (2 effects<br/>
such as hymm and clarity)<br/>
<br/>
Just a few suggestions, I would like to hear everyone suggestions and<br/>
prehaps the best ones could be posted on EQ boards to get Verant moving.<br/>
