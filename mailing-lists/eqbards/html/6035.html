&gt; 25 is a mini-hell.  Most people don&#39;t notice it, but I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; estimate it took me about 70% longer to get through it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ack say it isn&#39;t so =(.  I dinna want it to be so.  THough I think it is<br/>
noticable in Unrest since the mobs are mostly blue to me now.  Perhaps 25<br/>
is one of those inbetween levels where most things are green or even =(.<br/>
Time to check Mistmoore then.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At 31 you lose about a bubble per death (vs. about 1/4-1/3 at<br/>
&gt; 30 and 32).  If you tend to have a high number of deaths per<br/>
&gt; level as I know many of you do, this can really screw you up.<br/>
&gt; Whereas before you were taking 5 steps forward and 2 steps<br/>
&gt; back for a net gain of 3 steps a night, at 31 this can turn<br/>
&gt; into 5 steps forward and 6 steps back for a net loss of 1 step<br/>
&gt; a night, even though you are gaining experience and dying at<br/>
&gt; the exact same rate as before.  I hear this holds true for all<br/>
&gt; hell-levels + 1.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ack, now I am getting depressed my friend.  I was so happy to have cleared<br/>
leel 24 with only one death.  As my friends know well I am way to big on<br/>
the honour and chivalry bit and hence forth I die way too often<br/>
helping/saving friends.  Oh well I guess I will be one of those  bards who<br/>
will congratulated 20-30 times for getting my level 30 =).  Anyone know a <br/>
pretty cleric who would be willing to marry a bard who is proone to dying<br/>
and causing trains?  ... ANy takers?... I guess not =)<br/>
