<div id="ygrps-yiv-504923286">As bats and such have no faction I would think it would have no affect on<br/>
them, similar to the lack of an effect of the gargoyle.  As for walking into<br/>
Neriak, I assume this is what the song&#39;s purpose was, possibly not for<br/>
Neriak, but perhaps making the trip to Lavastorm or through Innothule swamp<br/>
less treacherous by playing it on the guards.  I havent tried to do this<br/>
yet, as the first time I step foot into Nektulos, it will be with guns<br/>
blazing.  <br/>

I just bought the song and have yet to try it out. I understand faction and <br/>
all. I was wondering about npc&#39;s with no faction standing (say a bat, or a <br/>
wasp for example - I would also think even Mistmoore Gargoyles fall under <br/>
this category), if you use the song on something that is &quot;ready to attack&quot;, <br/>
does it make the creature &quot;indifferent&quot; or &quot;apprehensive&quot;?? Or does it only <br/>
work on npc&#39;s with faction ratings? It would be cool to be able to walk into<br/>
<br/>
an evil city using this song, kinda like an evil enchanter could disguise <br/>
him/herself and walk into Freeport.<br/>
