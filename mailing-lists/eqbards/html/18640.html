<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358649830">Well I went into the Mines of Nurga last night.  Found no oven or other<br/>
combining device like pottery wheels or kilns.  It could be that the<br/>
necessary items to forage for the cake are only available in that zone, or<br/>
perhaps in the Temple of Droga.  I did not search the Temple of Droga for an<br/>
oven though.  I&#39;ll try and remember to do that tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Sineras, you say that you fear that you may have said too much which implies<br/>
that you know more.  What might you know that you&#39;re not telling us, pray<br/>
tell?  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 	This is all what I figured about the quest when i first<br/>
&gt; heard about it. So<br/>
&gt; far as I gathered, there is no recipe. We apparently have to find one or<br/>
&gt; rather forage one where burynai live. Well... technically &#39;we&#39;<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t forage<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
&gt; 	And the helm is supposedly from Sebilis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	But I fear I&#39;ve said too much now... :)<br/>
&gt; 	Good Journey<br/>
