<div id="ygrps-yiv-705038685">Twilight pulls the MOB in a direction parallel to a front-to-back line drawn through the Bard.  I was<br/>
originally annoyed that it didn&#39;t pull the MOB towards me in all cases, but once you get the hang of it,<br/>
it&#39;s pretty handy.  Why tanks don&#39;t understand that four tanks beating on something from the front is<br/>
going to knock it off the cliff that&#39;s right behind it, I don&#39;t understand.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Pixie Strike oddity<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was using Pixie in Karnors last weekend and noticed something really odd.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always assumed the knockback component pushed the mob away from the<br/>
&gt; Bard.  Instead, it pushes it in the direction the Bard is facing (was very<br/>
&gt; handy to learn &#39;cause we were in the tower, and it&#39;s easy to knock mobs off<br/>
&gt; of it :).  Does anyone know if the 53rd song does the same?  Only 51 here,<br/>
&gt; so it&#39;s gonna be a while before I can test it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, anyone ever climbed outside of Chardok? : )<br/>
