<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036939495">As chance would have it, I was surfing jewelry lists at lunchtime today, and <br/>
this is exactly the list I generated for myself.  The earrings are <br/>
disappointing; I wonder if this is as good as they get, or if better earrings <br/>
just haven&#39;t been discovered yet.<br/>

&gt; This has been covered before to some degree, but I was hoping to start a<br/>
