<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352702401">Good question.  I guess that the bard&#39;s role will depend on the composition<br/>
of the rest of the team (groups.) When we (my guild) goes to do some plane<br/>
stuff, we make sure we have enough clerics, enchanters, and tanks.  Our SOP<br/>
(standard operating procedure) is built around those classes.  I guess some<br/>
others will vary the mix and use more clerics and tanks and skip the<br/>
enchaters or have one enchanter who is the clarity caster and trys not to<br/>
get killed. Our enchanters do crowd control and are fairly often getting<br/>
killed.<br/>
<br/>
So, one big part of my role is mana bard.  I&#39;ll typically get grouped with a<br/>
cleric and an enchanter and a couple tank types (and hopefully *not* the<br/>
puller.)  The cleric has to spend a lot of mana keeping the enchater alive<br/>
and really does not want to have to worry about me. So in those instances<br/>
where the enchanter is in critical need of support, I will stay out of the<br/>
melee and stay close to the cleric with mana song playing.<br/>
<br/>
When we go for a dragon, my group will usually be 2 or 3 tanks, 2 clerics,<br/>
me and maybe a caster if only 2 tanks.  We will get right next to the<br/>
dragon.  I stay by the cleric and tell the tanks to stay close to us.  At<br/>
first, I weave elemental and guardian with my Mistmoore drun and my palette<br/>
set for a quick switch to Hymn & Niv&#39;s with my 7 string lute - in case the<br/>
cleric get LOM and low health or dies and the tanks need some healing.<br/>
<br/>
Getting back to the planes.  If you are set for a pull and know what the mob<br/>
will fight you with, you can select songs accordingly.  There are some mobs<br/>
that do AE cancel magic or pilliage enchantment (they strip your buffs.)<br/>
There is another one that does AE drain stamina (excellent time to play Jig<br/>
of Vigor - no stamina means slower weapon speed and casters cant med when<br/>
they have 0 stamina.)  Some mobs have poison base and others have disease<br/>
base and of course some have magic base.  So, the Planar bard should know<br/>
these things and be ready to provide the appropriate resist buffs.<br/>
<br/>
I think a bard in a group could really shine - especially if they are going<br/>
in with a group that does not have an enchater or tanks who dont have haste<br/>
gear.  But the groups I have gone with have always been my guild and we have<br/>
both enchanters and haste gear. I need to go build some xp so I can venture<br/>
forth one again.<br/>
