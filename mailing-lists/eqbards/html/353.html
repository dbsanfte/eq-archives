<div id="ygrps-yiv-922481298">Your location, who you are trying to sell to, and how many people know the<br/>
item&#39;s source also has an impact on the prices.<br/>
	Level: Selling a minotaur axe to someone that is 6th or 8th level might be<br/>
worth it for them since they cannot obtain one themselves. Selling the same<br/>
axe to someone higher just comes down to a matter of convenience. &quot;Do I want<br/>
to actually waste time going after a minotaur to get an axe or is it just<br/>
better to buy it?&quot; After a certain price, it might become worth it to get it<br/>
yourself.<br/>
	Location: Selling a minotaur axe in Misty won&#39;t generate much stir since<br/>
the source is nearby and most people who can physically obtain an axe could<br/>
quickly do so. Selling a Dwarven Axe in Misty (or a Runed Totem Staff in<br/>
Toxxulia(?)) might bring in more because it is basically an import (as far<br/>
as most players know).<br/>
	Source: If a player doesn&#39;t know where the item can be obtained they might<br/>
be more inclined to buy it than wandering around in hopes of finding the<br/>
golden spot, possibly never finding it. Now I don&#39;t recommend withholding<br/>
large amounts of information from players but sometimes it&#39;s more fun from a<br/>
roleplaying standpoint to let knowledge be the goods of trade.<br/>
<br/>
	I would agree that players should check other prices before paying whatever<br/>
the seller is asking, but just because a Runed Totem once sold for 20 plat<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it should be sold for that everywhere to everyone. Heck, I<br/>
heard one player say you should ask 100 plat for the totem cause he saw<br/>
someone buy it for that once.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

REFERENCE PRICES WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC BEFORE YOU BUY!<br/>
<br/>
(I know the following is understood by most people, but if it helps out ONE<br/>
person, then I&#39;m happy.)<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t jack up prices, purely out of respect for others,<br/>
however, I don&#39;t feel that those who do are completely ignoble.  What is<br/>
keeping newbies from asking others what prices are fair before they blow<br/>
their hard earned cash?  The same goes for the experienced adventurer when<br/>
dealing with the occasional magic item or relic.  If they don&#39;t, they really<br/>
are punishing themselves, and in my opinion are half responsible for their<br/>
own ill fortune.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people buying minotaur axes for as much as EIGHT plat.<br/>
Considering most half-decent scam artists don&#39;t even advertise the price on<br/>
/auction, it just makes it just TOO easy.  I am friends with a high level<br/>
player who bought a runed totem staff for 40 platinum.  That is ALSO<br/>
extremely high, but the vendor assured him he was getting the lowest price<br/>
possible.  I&#39;ve seen them go for as low as 20Plat, but the average would<br/>
have to be around 30 plat.  Don&#39;t worry, I make fun of him all the time for<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
So, please, before you fork over your plat to a greedy vendor, ask a friend<br/>
about  the prices.  If you don&#39;t have anyone you trust to ask, then ask on<br/>
/ooc, or /auction.  Whatever you do, don&#39;t take ONE PERSONS word on it,<br/>
especially if they are selling you the item.  I hope you wouldn&#39;t in real<br/>
life!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Gabriel<br/>
