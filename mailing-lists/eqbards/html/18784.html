<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552624365">Howling Stones is super high level dungeon that requires each person in the<br/>
group to have a key to get inside.  To get a key you supposedly have to spend a<br/>
lot of time camping a greenie mob.  I believe Verant said they were gonna<br/>
increase the drop rate on the keys.  If you&#39;ve been following the corpse<br/>
recovery dabate recently, this dungeon was part of the ordeal.  Apparently six<br/>
50+ people went to Howling Stones to explore it.  I believe they were the first<br/>
group on their server to do so.  To there horror, there were six level 50+ mobs<br/>
waiting for them when they completed zoning in.  Since they weren&#39;t able to all<br/>
zone in at the same time (lag, connection speed, etc), each one of them got gang<br/>
raped by six mobs as soon as they completed zoning.  So all six of them now had<br/>
corpses in a zone that required a special key to get into.  That meant they all<br/>
had to camp the greenie mob again to get the keys.  And since the six mobs would<br/>
still be there, they would have to treat this like a Fear break and get a lot of<br/>
other people to help them with CR.  This meant camping the key for those people<br/>
as well.  This all took a lot of time and they were concerned that 24 hours of<br/>
online time would pass before they were able to get keys for everyone.  Not<br/>
certain how this issue was resolved but I believe a GM gave them 12 keys so they<br/>
could do CR.  No idea what happened after this.<br/>

Howling Stones for Breastplates perhaps?  Has anyone actually explored<br/>
Howling Stones at all yet that anyone knows of?<br/>
