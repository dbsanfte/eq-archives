<br/>
Before you read this just keep in mind im just curious as to why worship,<br/>
sure i understand that some stuff should be wieldable by deity specific<br/>
characters, but also keep in mind that they also should keep the balance for<br/>
the agnostic people in the world. I chose agnostic for many reasons, i find<br/>
i am more accepted in different towns because of this, not much but still it<br/>
helps. I like the idea of deity specific stuff but i *hope* that they will<br/>
not favor certain deities and have deity specific stuff for each deity as<br/>
well as unholy items for us agnostics.<br/>
<br/>
On another note...<br/>
<br/>
Why worship. This reminds me of an old pun advertisement i read somewhere...<br/>
<br/>
honda in the 70&#39;s had an add that was something like :<br/>
follow us we&#39;re riding hondas<br/>
<br/>
then a mile down the road harley had an add:<br/>
Ride a harley, don&#39;t follow anyone...<br/>
<br/>
It says it all, i know i&#39;ve gone off topic abit but i personally don&#39;t like<br/>
following something i&#39;ve never seen... Why put my faith into something that<br/>
does not manifest its presence in the world? While all you worshippers are<br/>
spending time in the temples worshipping a god that somewhere someone is<br/>
camping, i&#39;ll be having a beer at the tavern with my friends 8)  When ya<br/>
think about it, why are people worshipping a god? gods are gods, they cant<br/>
be killed by a group of people, doesnt make sense in my book.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and ya some of the gods do have a presence in the world... but think<br/>
about it, my necro follows innoruk, and i have to kill my god to get the pet<br/>
enhancing book. I guess i&#39;m agnostic after all.  Either that or when i go<br/>
buy my next coffin in innoruk&#39;s temple i&#39;ll probably burn up on entry or<br/>
something.<br/>

&gt; Is it just me or does this part concern anyone a bit:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity.  If a deity<br/>
&gt; restriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you<br/>
&gt; right-click-and-hold on the item.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I chose Tunare as my deity so many moons ago when I started Faras (April<br/>
&gt; 11,<br/>
&gt; 1999 - today is my one year anniversary in EQ) because I wanted to RP a<br/>
&gt; tree-hugging nature bard type, the mother of all and so forth.  There have<br/>
&gt; been times I wished I had chosen Bristlebane but I still think Tunare<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; goes with how I play than Bristlebane does.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At any rate, I wonder what weapons I have that the Momma of All might<br/>
&gt; suddenly find unnaceptable...nothing like a hen-pecking mother to spoil<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; fun.<br/>
