<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455313684">Also Dark Elves are called &quot;Inkies&quot; (Inky - singular) by some of their less<br/>
adoring fans.<br/>

A group member one evening said that &quot;mob&quot; comes from MUDs, where monsters were<br/>
originally dubbed &quot;mobiles&quot;. Sounds reasonable to me, but having never played<br/>
any online game other then Diablo, Quake, and UO (but I do roleplay some!) I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t know for sure.<br/>
