<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958828682">Sorry, I couldn&#39;t resist the pun on your last name Harmonic :P.<br/>
<br/>
Harmonic, having never been on a succesful Dragon raid on Innoruuk I&#39;m<br/>
surprised to see your... confidence by which say these things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  1) Lag.  You will be lucky to even get twisting in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a crappy computer.  I turn everything off, play in a tiny window,<br/>
and I can still twist 2 songs fine during a Dragon raid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  2) You will get more attention than you wanted, starting and stopping<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nagafen has never melee&#39;d me the 2 times my bard went on a SUCCESFUL<br/>
dragon raid.  Attention isn&#39;t the issue at all, it&#39;s surviving his AE dmg<br/>
and fear.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  3) Ok, so you are gonna lag and get beat up a little.  You still<br/>
&gt;     need to twist.  Here&#39;s the kicker.  Your COLD/HEAT bonus from<br/>
&gt;     those songs doesn&#39;t do much.  AE Breath will hit for normal if<br/>
&gt;     your resistance is 25 or 125.  Take it for what it&#39;s worth,<br/>
&gt;     and you may not believe it, but it&#39;s confirmed.  Now, you may<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For everything supposedly &quot;confirmed&quot; one way, it&#39;s been confirmed the<br/>
other way as well.  From my personal experience, your resists being high<br/>
makes Naggy and Vox partial a LOT.  Last time I went with 150-ish resists<br/>
on my cleric and I took less than 800 damage the entire fight from<br/>
beginning to end, and I was standing right under him.  Since you&#39;re not<br/>
playing resist songs and obviously letting Nagafen have his way with you,<br/>
perhaps you should try a new tactic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  4) Your damage counts.  I&#39;ve seen so many people say, Argh!  He<br/>
&gt;     only had a sliver left.  Think if you added your 400 - 500 dmg<br/>
&gt;     into the attack?  You&#39;ve got weapons, use em!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Haha, that&#39;s funny.  I&#39;d take Selo&#39;s Handrum with Elemental/Guardian<br/>
Rhythms over my Orb of Tishan/Ykesha any day.  If I ever tried to melee,<br/>
my guild would probably laugh.  By playing my resist songs, the situation<br/>
of &quot;Argh! he only had a sliver left&quot; never becomes an issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  No disrespect, cause I love ya a lot girl, but L40 bards aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  cut out for dragon raids, unless the server is scrapped for people<br/>
&gt;  at the time of the raid.  Simply because the songs you really<br/>
&gt;  need are higher up, and the level difference really hurts your<br/>
&gt;  DragonFear resist and ability to strike the monster.  As much <br/>
&gt;  as I wanted to go to do them in the past, I had to defer the<br/>
&gt;  work to someone more experienced.  Which is exactly what I did.<br/>
&gt;  Bust your ass so we can fight together at full power (L50) again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Harmonic, my guild went on 2 dragon raids with me tagging along as the<br/>
bard (the other 30 or so dragon raids have been with my cleric), both<br/>
times I ended up in a primary group, when we had level 50 people who<br/>
could&#39;ve taken that position.  Both times we were succesful.  I&#39;m not<br/>
going to try and arguing the finer points of stats or resists, the proof<br/>
is in the putting, and once you do some putting, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll see the<br/>
same. All I can say is, I&#39;ve been there, done that, the RIGHT way, and<br/>
won.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Sylly!  You&#39;re in Pantheon now, I didn&#39;t even notice :P.  Congrats,<br/>
Gallenite and Archi are great people :).<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S. Yeah Sylly, we got both Naggy and Vox yesterday, but both are back.<br/>
Tonight&#39;s plan is Naggy again, and we have an agreement with someone else<br/>
(I have no clue whom, was worked out by my guild leader) to let them get a<br/>
couple of days to try Vox with.  If they fail, we&#39;ll kill Vox this<br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.P.S. The only reason we put pressure on ML and Storm to yield to us<br/>
was because one of our members was bound on the pedestal where Vox sits<br/>
from a previous Vox killing and gated back without remembering to rebind.<br/>
Hence, getting him back was a high priority of ours.<br/>
