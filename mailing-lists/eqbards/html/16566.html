<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865833457">Interesting.  From the emails I have recently gotten it did seem that GZ was<br/>
beginning to think bards were more caster than hybrid in some ways, but I<br/>
didn&#39;t think their mood had switched that far.  Must be a result of playing<br/>
one and seeing first hand how far behind the other hybrids our melee ability<br/>
really is.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas I like best are the group bind anywhere, the evac with random<br/>
destination, and some kind of stun.  There are numerous classes with stun<br/>
ability already, cleric, enchanter, necro, wizard.  To balance the stun it<br/>
would probably have to be AoE to limit its use in dungeons and last only 1<br/>
tick.  Still a six second stun would be nice, but using it continuously<br/>
would mean not weaving any other songs in.<br/>
<br/>
Other than these I agree we need some kind of better group buffing songs.<br/>
Shamans can already buff an entire group better than we can without<br/>
exceeding their mana regen rate.  We need to get something so good that<br/>
groups will be torn between having us sing that or mana song.  Anything to<br/>
force people to not have us as group members solely for mana song would be a<br/>
huge plus.<br/>
<br/>
An improved Healing song is probably a must, an improved combat speedup song<br/>
like Anthem perhaps as well.  Perhaps a single target, burn all mana,<br/>
mega-damage song similar to the insta kills other classes are getting at 60,<br/>
at least if you believe the files.  My guess is those are the bogus spells<br/>
GZ added in though.<br/>

Nameless crashed tonight and in the chat room<br/>
GM-Hideaki was there.  He and GZ were brainstorming on<br/>
ideas for new bard songs (they were in the same room).<br/>
 I told him we could help, and that I&#39;d email him our<br/>
best ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Please email directly to me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gww6e@...">gww6e@...</a>) your<br/>
ideas.  Please please please don&#39;t waste this<br/>
opportunity.  The bind song is an option, its been<br/>
covered actually and was proposed to me for my ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your hastly responces,<br/>
