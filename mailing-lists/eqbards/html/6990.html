<b>Subject:</b> Weapons Selection - Fanged Skull Stiletto <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-764617325">I have heared a lot of people talk about the sword of Ykesha and the<br/>
Wakizashi (sp:) as being two of the best weapons that a bard can use.  Well<br/>
I was wondering about the Fanged Skull Stiletto which is DAM 12 Delay 22<br/>
piercing and usable by Bards.  It is apparently not a lore item so you could<br/>
in theory get two of these and be a virtual quisinart.  Does anyone own one?<br/>
Know how to get one?  I have heard that they come from somewhere in Dagnour<br/>
Cauldron.  Perhaps this item is so hard to get that it is not realistic to<br/>
obtain untill really high levels.  Info please :)<br/>
