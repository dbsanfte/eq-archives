&gt; &gt; In fact, I&#39;m for<br/>
&gt; &gt; putting level 50 characters into forced retirement until the expansion<br/>

&gt; &gt; other twinked characters.  Plus we&#39;d stop distracting the developers from<br/>

&gt; &gt; level 50 players to do is not an important problem in the game.<br/>

&gt; If you think pushing L50&#39;s out of the game would stop farming for guilds<br/>
&gt; you are dreaming. It was happening long before there were any L50&#39;s on<br/>

that people will just make sure they die over and over at 49<br/>
to make sure they never reach 50.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I so like the loot-once idea that&#39;s been Kabonged.<br/>
:-)  Once you&#39;ve looted all the major mobs, the game is<br/>
essentially over and tricks like killing yourself to lose<br/>
experience won&#39;t let you artifically extend it.<br/>
