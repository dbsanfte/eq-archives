<br/>
Unfortunately you&#39;ll see this as a fairly common occurance as how the items are laid out.<br/>
<br/>
Want to get a few good Druid items?  You&#39;d best get used to killing a number of treant&#39;s first.<br/>
You say you&#39;re a goodly-aligned magic type, but you want an Oracle Robe?  You wont find some evil orc keeping them stashed away somewhere.  You&#39;ll have to kill the innocent Oracle in cold blood.<br/>
<br/>
The truly unfortunate result of this is that it propogates the &quot;hey that named farmer is white to me, lets kill him and see what he has!&quot; notion, as people start raising levels, you&#39;ll see this more & more too.<br/>

    In the name of Erollisi I hope there is another way to get these than by killing one of the sisters.  I feel dirty at even the thought that there are Necromancers hunting sisters for there pelts, I mean belts.  I guess I will have to make a pilgrimage to that island and cast my belt into the sea.  I have much pennance to do for profitting by the death of such an unfortunate.  <br/>
<br/>
            Good thing I&#39;m not on the pvp server or I&#39;d spend all my time dying while trying to prevent people from killing the poor little sisters.  come to think of it that&#39;s why I&#39;m not on the pvp server.  I&#39;d be spending all my time dying trying to protect all the good people getting killed by other supposedly good people.  Nothing like watching a paladin slaughtering stonecarvers in Butcherblock, asking him what he&#39;s doing, and having him respond, &quot;They&#39;re the only thing in BB that gives me xp, and I can kill them while waiting for the boat.&quot;  If that isn&#39;t bad enough, he was in /roleplaying mode!  Some people will never get it.<br/>
