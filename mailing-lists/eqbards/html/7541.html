<div id="ygrps-yiv-514323154">One way to make the &quot;corpse recovery&quot; period less painful...<br/>
If you play with the same people routinely and trust them, have the warrior<br/>
type consent you to drag their corpse.  That way, the remaining members of<br/>
the party can work on getting the corpse to the zone while the city bound<br/>
runs back.  Multi-tasking :-)  Works well for me, but I can understand why<br/>
some might not want to use it... still an idea though.  <br/>

				I am afraid this might be getting out of<br/>
hand but I value your opinion and<br/>
				want to continue.<br/>
<br/>
				Now that would be boring.  Reduces the game<br/>
to an arcade game.  wait that&#39;s<br/>
				why I don&#39;t play Quake, Diablo, etc.  I want<br/>
a death penalty.  But losing an<br/>
				entire night of playing, not just its gains<br/>
mind you but a sizeable chunk of<br/>
				the actual playing time, is too harsh.<br/>
especially when its just because you<br/>
				had the misfortune to zone into a 4 griffene<br/>
train on the bridge in N<br/>
				karana.  My game play two nights ago was<br/>
literally.  Awake in east Karana.<br/>
				Zone into N Karana.  Never even appear<br/>
there, just zoned for 6 minutes.<br/>
				Appeared in Halas.  Run to N Karana to get<br/>
my body whcih had both my drums<br/>
				on it since I was doing corpse retrieval at<br/>
the time anyhow.  Run to Qeynos,<br/>
				my original destination.  Camp.  Wow, that<br/>
was fun.<br/>
<br/>
				I don&#39;t disagree with you too often Michael,<br/>
you hae a good perspective on<br/>
				most things I think.  On this though i think<br/>
you are missing the real<br/>
				penalty a lot of us pay for dying.  Death =<br/>
no playing.  This rule applies<br/>
				to 90% of the people I personally know who<br/>
play during at least 50% of their<br/>
				playing sessions.  That&#39;s proabably a<br/>
defining reason why only one person I<br/>
				personally know is over 24th level.  He made<br/>
30 while on a two week vacation<br/>
				with a broken leg.  He is still at 30 and<br/>
hating his &#39;Hell&#39; level big time<br/>
				now that he can&#39;t play any more than the<br/>
rest of us and can&#39;t group with us.<br/>

				i&#39;ve never played, but i heard in quake 2 if<br/>
you die you respawn right away<br/>
				in the same area and can start killing again<br/>
with absolutely no downtime or<br/>
				zoning.<br/>
