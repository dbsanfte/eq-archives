<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890877550">When discussing stats and their effects on missed notes,<br/>
keep in mind that Verant defined a skill of 75 as average.<br/>
With this is mind, the speculation that having 110 versus<br/>
140 dex or agility or charisma makes a large difference in missed<br/>
notes is probably off the mark. Think of selling prices. Going<br/>
from 60 to 75 chr makes a noticable difference. But going from<br/>
150 to 200 makes no difference. Why? Its capped of course (best<br/>
selling price minus 5 percent I believe). There is an elastic<br/>
range in which stat increases make a large difference but after<br/>
a certain point, you hit a point of diminishing returns. If<br/>
a person with 110 dex is missing notes constantly, I submit<br/>
that what ever the source of the problem, it is not that<br/>
particular stat. Based on the way other stats work, going<br/>
from 110 to 140 would at best reduce missed notes 10 percent<br/>
or so.<br/>
<br/>
One side note on stats and their progression. AGI and AC or INT<br/>
and MANA are different in nature. Stats that are linearly tied<br/>
to other stats tend to have an arithmetic progression by<br/>
definition. In contrast, the effect of stats on skill checks tend<br/>
to be asymptotic because there are only too possible outcomes-<br/>
success or failure. As you approach the tail of the bell curve,<br/>
each stat increase has a lower and lower impact on your success rate.<br/>
After all, you cant get a message like-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You REALLY hit that note! Lullaby throws Werebat into a COMA!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Charisma and prices are interesting in that around the mean stat<br/>
(75), it moves like AGI and AC but because of the base selling<br/>
price, the variance is restricted and the impact hits a brick wall<br/>
like a yes/no skill check at the tails of the distribution.<br/>
So CHR looks like int around the mean but it tapers at the tails<br/>
like skill check related stats. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, there is a lot of generalization in this post but I think the<br/>
basic point is fairly clear- super high stats are not the explanation<br/>
or solution to the missed notes problem (or bug). If anyone wants<br/>
to discuss the statistical issues in precise detail, I would be glad<br/>
to 8)<br/>
