<b>Subject:</b> Looking for a few good bards ! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-672319379">Hello fellow bards !<br/>
<br/>
Due to a sore lack of rp events on the supposed &quot;RP&quot; server Fennin Ro, I<br/>
have decided to organize the first Norrathian Rock Band (don&#39;t laugh -yet ).<br/>
What i am planning to do is get a few bards together, no more than 5 or so,<br/>
and do a Tour across Norrath , playing a concert one city every week, on<br/>
whenever time everyone can (most likely friday or saturday night) . what i<br/>
would like to do for the band (tentative name: The Lutesmashers) would be to<br/>
take popular songs (new and old) and &quot;midevalize&quot; them. I think it would<br/>
hopefully start a chain reaction of events on the server, and would also be<br/>
a good time with lots of laughs for all in attendance.<br/>
here&#39;s the list of people i am looking for :<br/>
a drummer (any lvl 5 and up bard)<br/>
a bassist (any lvl 8 and up bard)<br/>
a lead singer (any bard of any level who can type fast and accurately and<br/>
please a crowd :)<br/>
a Introducer (&quot;And now, live from the Freeport Amphitheater, the<br/>
Lutesmashers!&quot;)<br/>
anyone with humorous/interesting song ideas<br/>
a couple people to RP security guards or roadies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
well, thats all.. i really hope this will be successful, i am tired of<br/>
reading on EQVault about the other server&#39;s events and there are NONE on<br/>
Fennin , this should give the other guys something to be jealous about :)<br/>
