&gt; This is definitely not true.  Just this week, I was bored and <br/>
&gt; decided to try <br/>
&gt; to figure out how to use the lockpicks I had bought when I got the <br/>
&gt; lockpicking skill.   I just happened to be in West Commons, <br/>
&gt; so I headed on <br/>
&gt; over to Befallen.  I finally discovered that you can pick ALL <br/>
&gt; the Befallen <br/>
&gt; locks by holding the lockpick on your cursor and <br/>
&gt; left-clicking on the door.  <br/>
&gt; I opened each door several times, never got a failure, but <br/>
&gt; never got a skill <br/>
&gt; raise either.  I don&#39;t remember if I had trained several <br/>
&gt; points into the <br/>
&gt; skill or not (I may have; I had a lot of training points to waste)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About the Hole entrance rock thing;  I went along on a Hole <br/>
&gt; raid around <br/>
&gt; level 40 (yeah, a little young, but you know how those <br/>
&gt; caster&#39;s want their <br/>
&gt; crack song... hehe).  Apparently you might not even need the <br/>
&gt; locked rock <br/>
&gt; picked as there is some space around it you may be able to <br/>
&gt; swim through (of <br/>
&gt; course SOMEONE has to let the big races in).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Interesting thing about the raid was that they brought along <br/>
&gt; a few level 1-3 <br/>
&gt; rogues along to sneak/hide their way around for corpse <br/>
&gt; recovery...  Worked <br/>
&gt; really well too!  =8^)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which brings up another question of mine...  It seemed that <br/>
&gt; those level 1-3 <br/>
&gt; rogues worked wonders with Sneak/Hide.  Now, being level 1-3 they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; sneak/hide skills can&#39;t be all that high (unless like Iksars <br/>
&gt; that are born <br/>
&gt; with Swimming skill of 100).  Now, how well does bard sneak/hide work <br/>
&gt; compared with level 3 rogues?  Is there some technique to <br/>
&gt; using sneak/hide?  <br/>
&gt; I tried sneaking behind something in Kaesora the other day <br/>
&gt; and the mob <br/>
&gt; immediately aggroed on me.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hmmm... I thought I saw a patch message a while back about <br/>
&gt; the locks in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Befallen being changed so you couldn&#39;t pick them anymore?<br/>
