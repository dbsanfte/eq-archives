I haven&#39;t really been able to consistently break the locked song by spamming<br/>
the hotkey, but I was able to do so by pressing and holding the hotkey for<br/>
another song until the icon for the stuck one disappears.<br/>

&gt; You can also mesh one of your song (hit the hotkey for one of <br/>
&gt; your song <br/>
&gt; about 15 times really really really fast) and that will <br/>
&gt; unlock your song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve noticed that if I take a lag spike when singing,<br/>
&gt; &gt;it will lock the song in, and then I can&#39;t sing any<br/>
&gt; &gt;song until I get bashed, zone, or log off and back on. </span></blockquote></div>
