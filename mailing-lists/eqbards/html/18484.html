<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-312752902">Last night after many weeks of pulling my hair out at my lockup problem<br/>
(random freezes and accompanying deaths) I actually managed to get some<br/>
soloing done for a couple of hours. I normally prefer grouping, but this<br/>
lockup problem soured a few friendships I had - they thought I was<br/>
ungracefully bowing out of the fight :(  - so I&#39;ve been solo while trying to<br/>
fix it. (The solution? Disable my SB Live!)<br/>
<br/>
My Bard&#39;s at level 22.  I&#39;m in the Swamp of No Hope and soloing blues and<br/>
whites (Icebone Skeletons, Froglok Gaz Warriors, Man Eating Plants and Giant<br/>
Marsh Leeches).  Spawns are plentiful and there&#39;s rarely more than 10 people<br/>
in the zone at peak times.<br/>
<br/>
The experience is coming thick and fast.  I&#39;m using a Brazen Brass Kilij in<br/>
my main hand and a Silvery War Axe in the off.  Pull tactic is: Lament any<br/>
surrounding mobs (only necessary near Frogloks), Selo&#39;s in, Bellow to get<br/>
their attention and pull back.  Then when I&#39;m in a spot clear of spawns,<br/>
Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding, stack Chant of Battle and Whistling Warsong and<br/>
alternate with Jig &#39;o Vigour to keep my stamina up.  I start Bellowing when<br/>
the beastie runs (Frogloks again), since lag sometimes means I&#39;m swiping at<br/>
thin air.</div>
