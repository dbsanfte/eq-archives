I could easily do 1-3 wisps with Bellows/Chords/Hymm ... 1-2 without<br/>
bellows.  Nice on a newbie too since Hymm and Chords are both string.  If<br/>
you need a break .. have Selo&#39;s up and kite a sec with heal/selo but usually<br/>
you won&#39;t need to.  Have a the lute to drum hotkey setup - and you should<br/>
always make zone if you need to bail out.   Spiders (have to sit to outheal<br/>
the poison so bad) and YKs (hit harder than the wisps) are a no-no.<br/>
Skellies Bad too (stun). Got a few looks to be sure .. but it worked!  Great<br/>
for pp too at those levels - which if untwinked is also something to<br/>
consider.<br/>

&gt; You really cant solo with insturments till 18 when you got Denon&#39;s.  If<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; are not twinked, grouping from levels 10-18 is your best bet.  Twinked,<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; could easily handle those levels on your own...<br/>
