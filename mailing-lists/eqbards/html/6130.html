<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521836317">I think EverQuest is balanced very very well.  In my experience no stone has<br/>
been left unturned to provide a game with subtlety and imagination.  There are<br/>
some unexpected things that have cropped up with 50,000 people playing the<br/>
game, however, but I think you have to expect that.<br/>
<br/>
I fully expect that one of the subtleties of the Bard class is that as you<br/>
mature into the role of Bard that your songs will, over time, start to do more<br/>
damage than your weapons when instruments are equipped.  So if you&#39;re &quot;joe<br/>
bard&quot; that plays 6 hours a week and doesn&#39;t read these messages or do as much<br/>
research into your class as we obviously do, you can still play the game as a<br/>
&quot;bad tank with a healing song&quot;.  However, if you&#39;re like us and divorce your<br/>
wife &#39;cause your family is keeping your from getting to level 50, you develop<br/>
your skills more fully.<br/>
<br/>
Where is the crossover point that songs do more damage?  I dunno, I&#39;m only<br/>
level 20 and I would very seriously doubt that I&#39;ve reached it yet.  My guess<br/>
is that by around level 30 it should be noticable.  I would think that by<br/>
level 50 it should be blatanly obvious to you that you should use songs and<br/>
instruments.  Can any 50th bards confirm this and/or estimate where the<br/>
crossover point is from weapons to songs?<br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest things about being a bard is the on-the-fly flexibility<br/>
that we have.  Last night in Runnyeye my party members gave me a backhanded<br/>
compliment on the way that I reacted to the fight (yeah, I&#39;m braggin&#39; a bit -<br/>
deal with it).  If we were fighting plain old goblins I&#39;d be playing buffing<br/>
songs, but when a shaman or other caster type showed up, I&#39;d switch hotkey<br/>
banks and start playing MR buffs.  It really surprised my party members to see<br/>
their buff icons change from Anthem and Hymn (plus Bellows) to Guardian,<br/>
Elemental and Hymn during a fight.  &quot;What&#39;s with all these buff icons changing<br/>
around in battle?&quot;  &lt;grin&gt;  Just the bard doing her job.  Back to the subject<br/>
though - these sorts of reactions to battle flow are something that all<br/>
talented bards do, and their effectiveness is greatly enhanced by our<br/>
instruments.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am level 24, armed with a dragoon dirk and a Polished Granite tomahawk.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Recently  a level 29 bard stopped by our group in SolA with a train<br/>
*laughs*<br/>
&gt; &gt; and ended up getting the kill with his horn on several goblins. I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; flabergasted (given that we have a level 28 warrior and level 26 cleric<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; wizard).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s because DDD is area effect - while you were busy<br/>
&gt; killing one goblin, he was building up &quot;kill credit&quot; with the<br/>
&gt; others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So I have been playing the the horn and Dennons Dischord then<br/>
&gt; &gt; swapping to the lute for chains or lull, then back to the horn. It&#39;s<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; &gt; really hard to say, but I MAY be doing more damage now...do we have hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; figures on DDD? I am very very curious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have any figures (though I may get some now that they<br/>
&gt; fixed the disarm thing and my friends *want* to go to the<br/>
&gt; arena).  But I did play with it extensively around L24-26<br/>
&gt; against tidal lords.  DDD, CoD, and Hymn played with just a<br/>
&gt; horn was slightly worse than with my weapons (dirk and barbed<br/>
&gt; whip).  Played with a horn and lute it was slightly better<br/>
&gt; than my weapons.  This was against a single opponent of<br/>
&gt; course.  If there were multiple opponents, DDD and CoD were<br/>
&gt; far far better as long as Hymn could keep me alive long enough<br/>
&gt; to kill them all.<br/>
