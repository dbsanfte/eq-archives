were carrying and accidently sold the fire opal lambent<br/>
without realizing it.  I&#39;ve done dumber things (gave away a<br/>
crystalline blade while distributing FS weapon loot to better<br/>
fit in everyone&#39;s weight allowances, sold that ranger sword<br/>
from LGuk to a merchant).  The graphics on these rare and<br/>
expensive items are the same as the &quot;normal&quot; items.<br/>
