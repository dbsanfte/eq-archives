<br/>
	Really? I was under the impression that it is way heavier than regular<br/>
plate. If this is correct why would anyone ever buy normal plate?<br/>

	I would agree that Paws is underpopulated in most servers (Cazic averages<br/>
10-15 in evenings) and the loot is quite decent although 100 plat might be<br/>
high unless you sell the staves at a high price.<br/>

	Soloing *all* of it at level 18 I can&#39;t quite agree with. Ghanex Drah can<br/>
bring some tense moments at times and Zixx Nenixx will simply smoke your @#$<br/>
all the way back to the zoneline. That is, if he doesn&#39;t charm you first. =)<br/>
He was red to me at 20 and was frequently hitting for 50. Then there is his<br/>
pet. And he seems to get some decent help from the locals too...<br/>

	Good Journey,<br/>

&gt;Looking for some good ideas for soloing and small team hunting around 18th<br/>

&gt;Unfortunately I seem to have solo hunting and hunting with a cleric partner<br/>
&gt;down to an art, but whenever I get into a group I always seem to die.  As<br/>
