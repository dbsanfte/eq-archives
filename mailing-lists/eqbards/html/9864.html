<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861290752"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think it would be interesting to get a list poll up to see how many<br/>
&gt; bards on the list actually use forage or hide, or even have them in<br/>
&gt; their hotkeys. We&#39;d have to have a seperate section for wood elf bards<br/>
&gt; as the wood elf natural cap is actually 10 higher than the default<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s (hmm, another contradiction to the jack of foraging idea)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is a Wood Elf&#39;s natural ability a contradiction?<br/>
<br/>
I used Forage all the time and NEVER had to buy food and rarely had to buy<br/>
water until my GF&#39;s mage got her level 24 Summon Food and Water spells.  The<br/>
only reason I stopped using Forage is now with the ease of summoning food I<br/>
don&#39;t have to keep a whole backpack to store all the different kinds of<br/>
foraged food.  Otherwise, yes... 1 vote here for using Foraged.  In my<br/>
experience, it&#39;s good enough.<br/>
<br/>
Hide is a different story... I have it hotkeyed but would never rely on it.<br/>
It&#39;s fun for parlor tricks.  : )  I don&#39;t mind it failing most of the time,<br/>
it&#39;s just not knowing if it&#39;s failed or not that&#39;s a bad design.<br/>
