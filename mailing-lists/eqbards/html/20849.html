back of the library without you, it will just take longer because the<br/>
casters will have to actually med to regain mana.<br/>

Subject: Re: [eqbards] Kaesora trouble<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ideally I won&#39;t be with them, since that would mean I&#39;ve died.  If they need<br/>
help I could get my 25 cleric there, but I wonder how much help he&#39;ll be...<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know if we have the fire power to get there with a group of 5<br/>
or 6, and I wonder how long it will be before we can get a group of 10 down<br/>
there.  Though it is the weekend, so I guess I have a shot of a bigger group<br/>
showing up (there are a total of 15 35+(hihgest 42) in the guild I think, 1<br/>
cleric, 1 wiz, 1 bard, 1 warrior, no Pally, SK, rogue, mage or necro).  We<br/>
are a very tight bunch, so anyone who is on will probably drop wahtever<br/>
they&#39;re doing and come (pretty much we adventure together all the time and<br/>
add pickups to fill holes)<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the help :)<br/>
