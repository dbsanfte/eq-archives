<br/>
I was in fear with friends the other night, I showed up late, they were in<br/>
the middle of a pull so I wasn&#39;t grouped right away.  My group of me, myself<br/>
and I got the experience on the spider even though all the other 20 people<br/>
hitting it were in groups. I joined a group the next fight, that group got<br/>
the first experience they had gotten all night.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t stop there, just to prove that all should fear the bard, I<br/>
switched groups, where, *gasp* experience flowed like milk and honey.<br/>
<br/>
Much gloating ensued until I saw:<br/>
<br/>
Cazic Thule says, ANTHEM!<br/>
<br/>
Ouch!<br/>
<br/>
And nope it wasn&#39;t the awesome damage of the planes weapons that work this<br/>
magic. That particular night I was using a Short Sword of Ykesha and an<br/>
Obsidian Shard.<br/>
<br/>
However, you might consider this to be one of those rare situations I&#39;m not<br/>
supposed to bring up so I will ask you this, if not for the bard, who is<br/>
supposed to entertain the group? Who is supposed to guarantee a good time<br/>
for all those along on the journey? Who is supposed to be the one to dance<br/>
with the phoboplasm in hopes of coaxing the elusive imbrued bracer from its<br/>
grasp (try /dance, /rude, etc with a phobo next time you fight it, you&#39;ll<br/>
see what I mean)?<br/>
<br/>
As bards, we are the best equipped to handle those duties for the group and<br/>
no other class will ever be able to do better.<br/>
<br/>
If I sit down and think about it some more I&#39;m sure I can come up with other<br/>
reasons. Unfortunately I&#39;m too mind numb from helping a cleric with one of<br/>
their stare-at-the-dirt-waiting-for-an-uberrare-spawn-and-call-it-a-quest<br/>
things to be able to think too straight at the moment.<br/>

P.S. - I&#39;m not really a kill stealer, while the events described above or<br/>
true, and while I did gloat about killstealing from those I was with, it was<br/>
all in jest. :)</div>
