<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007461427">Yep I noticed this last night.  Never became visible that I know of.  Also<br/>
one more thing I noticed about clouding.  I went to sell while invisible and<br/>
became visible.  Then on the next pulse I went invisible again.  Gotta love<br/>
being a bard.  =)<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I was talking to a higher level ranger friend of mine and he asked if<br/>
I needed any foraged food or water.  I said I forage as well and had plenty<br/>
thanks.  I got a kick out of his next statement which was &quot;Is there anything<br/>
that you don&#39;t do?!?&quot;  As I said before, gotta love being a bard.<br/>

&gt; Did anyone else notice the &quot;you feel as if you are about to<br/>
&gt; become visible&quot; message with invisibility?  Of course Clouding<br/>
&gt; pulsed again before I became visible.  I have to wonder if<br/>
&gt; this fix (message 5 sec before invisibility blinks off) didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; just make Clouding 100% reliable...<br/>
