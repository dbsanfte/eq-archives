It&#39;s very hard to say &quot;No&quot; to a full set of bronze.´┐¢ I thought about it for<br/>
a second and the friend who´┐¢I had just met and offered it to me said she<br/>
would understand if I said no --- but Bronze is BRONZE! So, I said Thank you<br/>
VERY MUCH!<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
At a low level (11 iirc), to be sporting such visible and coveted armor can<br/>
be as much of a curse as a blessing.´┐¢ I get spit on, laughed at, taunted,<br/>
duel challenged, inspected constantly, begged from, &quot;please let me try it on<br/>
- you can hold my banded - I just want to see what´┐¢I would look like...&quot; and<br/>
lots of nice compliments.´┐¢ I made a social: &quot;It was a gift from a very nice<br/>
person!&quot;<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
But anyhow... I have seen purity belts and had one for a bit but sold it.´┐¢<br/>
The ac was pretty low and it was before I knew I would need str+ items.´┐¢ But<br/>
- I think it was looted off an Orc (or a Derv ?) Commonlands, Ro or Oasis?<br/>
It&#39;s icon looks like the normal trash loot belt and you need to right click<br/>
it to see that it&#39;s a purity belt and not just the normal belt. <br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Also, try getting some dimensional pockets or spirit pouches.´┐¢ Anything you<br/>
put in them becomes weightless.´┐¢ Becareful - they (and everything in them)<br/>
dissappear´┐¢when you camp.<br/>

And my gripe of the day -- TWINKING HAS BECOME RAMPANT ON EROLLISI<br/>
MARR!!!!!´┐¢ I saw a lvl 5 bard yesterday walking through Freeport with a full<br/>
suit of bronze plate.´┐¢ That&#39;s just silly.´┐¢ He said a friend gave it to him,<br/>
nice gift. <br/>
