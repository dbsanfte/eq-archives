<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356757869">Why is it that people seem to have it in thier head that GM&#39;s and Guides must help you if you cannot get<br/>
your corpse?<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY reason they assist in corpse retreival is if it is stuck in a wall. Or fallen through the world.<br/>
Or lost due to a verifiable bug.<br/>
<br/>
If you fall in lava. It is YOUR responsibility to get it back. (Hope you made friends)<br/>
<br/>
To say that GM&#39;s are worthless cause they told you &quot;tough sh*t&quot; is lke saying &quot;Dang. I cut my toe off with<br/>
this knife. Perhaps I should sue the hospital cause they can&#39;t put it back on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to play around dragons, lava, gods. You SHOULD expect trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I have died underneath Nagafen, but have still gotten my corpse. I have had guildmates lose thier corpses<br/>
on the other side of Fear. I have had guildmates lose corpses &quot;I forgot where&quot; in Sol B. But they have all<br/>
been retrieved. No GM was even called because they all were of our own doing. (Lag related or not).<br/>
<br/>
What you need is a group of people that you can trust to assist you when the chips are down.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is just me, but, if you lose your corpse in lava, don&#39;t go crying about the GM&#39;s not running to<br/>
your aid. They are not supposed to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Take responsibility of your own problems. If the problem is indeed a bug, then by all means call a GM.</div>
