<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910857339">Money IS a real problem !! I am being driven NUTS by groups declaring<br/>
they will loot &quot;Alpha 4P or FS, autosplit OFF&quot;... Then watch while the<br/>
looter carefully avoids looting anything with a weapon till last and<br/>
then they declare &quot;Nuts, all silver and a rusty&quot; :(   ...of course an<br/>
hour later your up for loot and the leader (Named Alphonse of course)<br/>
declares &quot;I gotta go guys, great playing with you&quot; and disbands the<br/>
group.<br/>
  Now I don&#39;t want to be a spoil sport but central loot collection and<br/>
no split schemes seem to me to have too many bugs to allow to be used in<br/>
groups I am in. If you need money my opinion is &quot;Alpha auto on&quot; is the<br/>
only way to go !!<br/>

PS. I am in debt to a guild member up to 150p. Guilds help but this is<br/>
&quot;business&quot; not family :)<br/>
    Any great money making schemes appreciated :)<br/>

&gt; has cost me 1000pp. Then it was time to kill more HG&#39;s for money as well as<br/>
&gt; lambents, I was down to only a few gold in the bank! This leaves no room to<br/>
&gt; pay for the lambent. Being guilded really helps though, just put out the<br/>
&gt; call for an HG expedition and I had a mid 30s to 40s crew in route<br/>
&gt; immediately for a profitable night. </span></blockquote></div>
