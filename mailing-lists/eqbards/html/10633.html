<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845189375">One, I think either Hotmail is messed up, or you need to check why you&#39;re <br/>
posting so many copies.  As for the rest, see my comments below:<br/>

&gt;    I was looking at the list of instruments and songs from the concert <br/>
&gt; hall, and I saw some info that concerdicted the song and instrument list <br/>
&gt; from this site.  I was wondering if any of you have tested the following <br/>
&gt; songs and instruments, and know which site is correct.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;song: Denon&#39;s Desparate Dirge, Lev 43, this site says damage is <br/>
&gt;311+(lev-43)*2 making MAX dame at Lev 50 only 325, and does not say <br/>
&gt;anything about mana; CH says it does 275 dam and requires 800mana?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It definitely requires mana, as for damage, I think the other site may have <br/>
had it correct.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Instrument: Mistmore battle drums: this site says +20%; CH says +25%<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe it was verified as 20%<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Instrument: Lute of the gypsy princes: this site says no effect; CH says +5%<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No effect is correct.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also on Bristlebane, so look for me there...<br/>
<br/>
(And for those keeping track, yes, my short-lived retirement is up... time <br/>
to revisit the realms...)<br/>
