<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323782572">Last night while I was testing out the CoD and DDD with my guildmate we were<br/>
in duel mode.  While testing, my guildmates would make fun of a bard vs a<br/>
cleric how she would wup my ass.  She is a lvl 39 clerics that can solo a<br/>
Raider in HK just fine.  While me being a lvl 35 bard cannot even solo a<br/>
hard blue guard, haha.  So anyway after my testing (which I posted on<br/>
another post), I told her why not duel and find out.<br/>
<br/>

I stop the fight because we know who would win from this, hehe.<br/>

She gains new respect for bard as a fighter, hehe.<br/>
