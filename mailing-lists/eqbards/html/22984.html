You used to be able to break root quickly with Bellow (don&#39;t have it memmed<br/>
much anymore though).  Don&#39;t know if they fixed it, but it&#39;s knock-back<br/>
component used to break root fast.<br/>

Prior to yesterday&#39;s patch, if you had Selos running, and then you got<br/>
rooted, the next time Selos refreshed it would break the root (which I&#39;m<br/>
sure everyone was already aware of).  For this reason alone, bards were the<br/>
best class for pulling in PoG.  Now if you get rooted, your stuck in place<br/>
until roots wears off or until you cancel magic it away.  This change is<br/>
contrary to what GZ stated a long time ago on how the song was intended to<br/>
work.  I only assume that whoever replaced GZ as spell system designer was<br/>
not aware of this.<br/>
