<div id="ygrps-yiv-624379219">I WANT the lambent helm - and have the Mudwater Rune - so I need the Opoline Helm.  I recall a discussion of these some time ago - and the archive search engine at www.onelist.com is basically useless (trust me - I tried...)<br/>
<br/>
    I do recall (and have heard from others on the server) that the problem of course is breaking the spawn; but I am looking for advice on what levels the party needs to be and other pulling techniques (does harmony or lament work, etc)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
