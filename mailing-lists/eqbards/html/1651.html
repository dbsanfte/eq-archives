<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678442441"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Everyone knows the bard is #1 on the hit list for enemy creatures.  In my<br/>
&gt; most recent skirmishes with the Dervish Cutthroats, I continually found<br/>
&gt; myself taking the brunt of the damage even though there were tanks in the<br/>
&gt; group.  Even when I tried to back up and quit attacking due to low health<br/>
&gt; the cutthroats continued to attack me even though I was doing no damage to<br/>
&gt; them.  The end result is that I ended up dying a couple of times when other<br/>
&gt; members of my group ended up taking either zero or little damage in the<br/>
&gt; fight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to die way too much in situations just like this.  Whether I was fetching<br/>
or not, I just could not seem to get the mobs off of me.  What I eventually<br/>
learned was how to manage the shit-list a little better so that the mobs would<br/>
hate the other members of my party as well.  It can be done.  If you are<br/>
fetching, that puts you at a big disadvantage to begin with, so when you get the<br/>
monsters back to your party, don&#39;t attack them.  Make your tanks, cuz you ain&#39;t<br/>
a tank, fight them for a few rounds.  Then jump back into the melee.  You can<br/>
still be useful to the party for those seconds by playing anthem and healing, or<br/>
whatever is appropriate for your level.  After a few rounds of tanks whacking on<br/>
them and spellcaster frying them, they will not be so entirely devoted to<br/>
killing you.  The important thing is that you not rush into the melee.  Trying<br/>
to back out of melee after you have been swinging away for several rounds just<br/>
does not work well for us.  When you are not fetching, this is very easy to<br/>
manage.  Just wait a few rounds before attacking.  Don&#39;t feel bad, Clerics and<br/>
Mages do it all the time, as they should, cuz if they start blasting away from<br/>
the first round, the mob will eat their lunch too.  Song selection is also<br/>
important.  Just because you have Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord or Kelin&#39;s Lucid<br/>
Lullaby does not necessarily mean you should be using them yet.  I could not get<br/>
KLL to work reliably until about level 19.  I tried it when I first got the song<br/>
and it would go off and put me at the top of their list, but since it was<br/>
failing on most pulses, they were free to whack on me.  Denon&#39;s still is not<br/>
very reliable for me at 20 unless I am using the horn, which I really don&#39;t like<br/>
to do much, so I rarely use it.  I will try again in a few levels.  Well, that<br/>
sounded a bit too much like a rant.  Tired, but had a great night killing<br/>
aviaks.  Took a party of 6 characters level 19 to 20 and killed some Avocets,<br/>
which we didn&#39;t really think we coud handle.<br/>
