&gt; I was in N FP last night working on Brewing when a Paladin friend of mine<br/>
&gt; came along and I told him I had been fishing in the moat around the<br/>
&gt; Paladin&#39;s guild and I then brewed some wine using the fish I caught there -<br/>
&gt; I offered him some of the wine and we had a few drinks, then, with my<br/>
&gt; fishing pole equipped, standing in front of the Bank, I targeted him and hit<br/>
&gt; &quot;Instill Doubt&quot; which initiated that wacky graphical emote that looks like a<br/>
&gt; combination of casting a buff and doing a dual-wield attack followed by the<br/>
&gt; amusing message &quot;you&#39;re not scaring anyone&quot;.  The funny part was that it<br/>
&gt; LOOKED like I was attacking him with my fishing rod and a bunch of people<br/>
&gt; were standing around the bank laughing their helmets off at the whole scene<br/>
&gt; - someone commented, &quot;Look at that drunk half-elf dueling with a fishing<br/>
&gt; rod!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately this is about the only use instill doubt actually has.<br/>
Even rogues find it useless. When it does work, it&#39;s just like the fear<br/>
song or spell and sends the mob running off, where he will most times<br/>
tell a few of his friends about the scary bard, and as they won&#39;t<br/>
believe him, they will come back with him to see for themselfs.<br/>
<br/>
Rogues wish the mobs wouldn&#39;t run away so fast so they might be able to<br/>
at least get a backstab in. Our skill caps so low at it that it&#39;s only<br/>
real use is amusing your friends while you sit around waiting for some<br/>
rare mob to spawn. :)<br/>
