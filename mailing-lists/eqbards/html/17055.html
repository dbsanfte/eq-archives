<div id="ygrps-yiv-295965345">New forage cap is 55.  I&#39;m a half elf and was previously maxed at 40.  I put<br/>
15 training points in last night, at which point I wasn&#39;t allowed to train<br/>
anymore.<br/>

I noticed this also, being a woodelf bard my forage raised to 51. I am very<br/>
pleased as I have got into a habit of pressing forage all the time, the<br/>
higher the skill the more food I&#39;m gonna have  =)<br/>
I only managed to raise the skill to 51 so not sure what it caps at, I&#39;m<br/>
hoping something like 75-80 (100 would be nice). I wonder now if they<br/>
raised any other skill caps in yesterdays patch.<br/>

Ps, Lost a roll on a sash last night, out of the classes that were in the<br/>
group (bard, ranger, monk, wizard, cleric and druid). The wizard won<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;. I rolled a lousy 23 and the wizard got 83.</div>
