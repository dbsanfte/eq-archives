<div id="ygrps-yiv-488983465">In addition to this, when you are fighting relatively non-aggressive mobs,<br/>
lull will have a much greater effect.  Like, I am fighting the Nybright<br/>
sisters in Lesser Faydark right now, and I can lull 3 of 4 of them, and I<br/>
will never get more than just one at a time, no matter what placement they<br/>
are in.  This is probably because if I wasn&#39;t attacking them, I could just<br/>
walk up and say hi.  I suppose this might work the same way with Aviaks or<br/>
Centaurs, which are naturally non-aggressive races.<br/>

Hope this helps,<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Insight into Lament<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The enchanter web site has a list of spell effects put<br/>
&gt; together with descriptions from one of the developers.  It<br/>
&gt; says lull type spells work by reducing the aggro radius of<br/>
&gt; creatures.  That would explain why sometimes Lament works (you<br/>
&gt; get the &quot;sad&quot; message), but when you pull a mob, the mob you<br/>
&gt; just Lamented still comes along.  If the mob you pull enters<br/>
&gt; the Lamented mob&#39;s aggro radius, both will come.  I&#39;ve played<br/>
&gt; around a bit with this with my enchanter and it really does<br/>
&gt; seem to work this way.  If I lull the closer mob and pull the<br/>
&gt; further one so it takes a path near the closer one, the closer<br/>
&gt; one almost always joins.  If I lull the further one and pull<br/>
&gt; the closer one, I almost always get it alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So when you Lament, be wary of the physical arrangement of the<br/>
&gt; mobs, and the path they will take to get to you.  It&#39;s also<br/>
&gt; possible that using a lute further reduces the aggro radius,<br/>
&gt; as opposed to (or in addition to) increasing the duration of<br/>
&gt; the Lament.<br/>
