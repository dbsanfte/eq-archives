<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-673431795">I have the exact same problem with my SB live card.  Spells sounds are<br/>
muffled when I stand (and being a dwarf, thats not very impressive) but<br/>
I sit down, and my roomate starts to complain about the racket...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Well - they&#39;re still doing weird things with sound.  I know that recently<br/>
&gt; all of my combat sounds started sounding &quot;really far away&quot; - Like they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; happening to someone standing near me, but not to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But if I sit down, the sounds are suddenly right??  I guess they have the<br/>
&gt; &quot;center of source&quot; as the center of the model - not the model&#39;s head?<br/>
