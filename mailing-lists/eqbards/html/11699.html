<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364527933">Let me offer a different place:<br/>
<br/>
Mid to High 30s xp, 3+ group members.<br/>
Lower Guk Live Side.  Sit at the base of the ramp as you zone in.<br/>
Pull anything you see.  Easily get 15% xp per hour with a decent tank.<br/>
Puller should be safe pulling from as far in as he can.  37.5 minute<br/>
spawn time, so lots of different stuff to kill.<br/>

&gt; (Oh hell, Crier and her soapbox again,)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cazic-Thule.  If you&#39;re 28th through 38th-ish I implore you to try<br/>
&gt; Cazic-Thule.  I&#39;ve said it before: There&#39;s a learning curve to the place,<br/>
&gt; but if you can get into a competent and reasonably balanced group in the<br/>
&gt; throne room, Archon temple top or alligators at the green and blue pools you<br/>
&gt; will be amazed at the experience and loot.  If you&#39;re unfamiliar with CT and<br/>
&gt; need a hand figuring the place out *please* just ask.  I cannot stress how<br/>
&gt; well I did in this place from 28th-37th.  I made TONS of experience: A full<br/>
&gt; level one Saturday at 31st and, and all of 30th in three evenings.  All the<br/>
&gt; while I was staggering under the weight of fine steel weapons and 1-4pp<br/>
&gt; drops.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Two nights ago I was hunting Spectres in Feerrott and was in a fair amount<br/>
&gt; of danger for pretty minimal exp.  My group was complaining about this so I<br/>
&gt; said &quot;Hey, Cazic-Thule is right here, let&#39;s go in there.&quot;  To which two of<br/>
&gt; my members replied along the lines of &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know Cazic well, only<br/>
&gt; been in there once or twice.&quot; so under my urging we went there and took the<br/>
&gt; upper throne room.  My group was utterly amazed.  I got one and a half<br/>
&gt; bubbles exp. in the two or three hours that we were there before I logged,<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m 37th!  My group *did* benefit from my 9 levels of experience and<br/>
&gt; Lament though (I was pulling).<br/>

&gt; [snip about hunting cyclops in Rathe Mts.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Once I make 30th level, I plan on making this spot my home until I get out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of hell level.  I heard that Highkeep basement was the best place<br/>
&gt; &gt; to safely<br/>
&gt; &gt; get out of 30th hell level because of its safety factor but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think camping<br/>
&gt; &gt; cyclops by the Lake zone in Rathe may actually be better (assuming you<br/>
&gt; &gt; canget in a group).  You have the zone for the safety factor plus the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cyclops spawn rate is much faster than pickclaws.<br/>
