<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890127683"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Oh Harmonic, I feel affinity to you now.  I am _scared_ <br/>
&gt; (Mara refrains from caps due to this newfound camaraderie).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s mostly a tease, although caps usually means emphasis,<br/>
  people like to use it to shout at you, so to speak.  However,<br/>
  I think strong sentance structure and thought flow can relay <br/>
  the same desired emphasis effect.  Some things you can&#39;t help ;)  <br/>
  IMO, YMMV, IIRC ... even EQ! hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t mean to single out any one person, but reading John&#39;s(tm)<br/>
  e-mails is very relaxing to me, since his grammar and spelling<br/>
  are excellent, his thoughts are very well organized, and he makes<br/>
  a huge impact without &#39;quoting&#39; or CAPPING.  I aspire to be more<br/>
  like you John(tm)  /end shameless plug<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
  Telling people not to caps strong words is like telling someone:<br/>
  &#39;Hey you cannot come into the hateplane, we are here now.&#39;  /laugh<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And the agreement around my place is: no complaining!  I did it to myself!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  lol!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hey, I really lucked out on an imbrued bracer drop from a cube in Fear <br/>
&gt; the other night.  I get these frantic tells from my group:  &quot;Quick!  Get<br/>
&gt; ressed and loot this bracer before it poofs!&quot;.  LOL like I had any<br/>
&gt; control. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  wowowow.  That&#39;s awesome!  lottoplasms rock.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Seriously, the lead monk went above and beyond (thanks Shishio) to drag <br/>
&gt; me back to be ressed with two Amy warriors on him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve got monk friends like that too.  Bold little guys, I guess if I<br/>
  had a button like they do I&#39;d be more daring as well.  Instead of<br/>
  Feign Death the button should be called &#39;You Can&#39;t Kill Me. Nya Nya&#39;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here&#39;s a suggestion for a new song:  Denon&#39;s Disco Inferno.  Makes <br/>
&gt; everyone in your party dance as long as you play it.  Or....makes <br/>
&gt; the mobs dance and stop attacking you.  Kind of like Lullaby but much<br/>
&gt; funnier animation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You know, everytime I&#39;m in the PoF - I have to take off all my armor<br/>
  and play tiny bubbles of music.  Nekkid Dance Party!  Then people also<br/>
  want to be able to dance with me, but they cant.  I wouldn&#39;t mind if<br/>
  Verant put in a skill/song/instrument that did nothing more than make<br/>
  your party members dance.<br/>
<br/>
  on a side note:  Has anyone watched an Ogre /dance ?  omfg... it&#39;s<br/>
                   hilarious.  That is _the_ best emote in the game.<br/>
<br/>
