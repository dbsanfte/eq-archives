<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910327405"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Just wanted to comment that my other character is an enchanter, and I<br/>
&gt;seriously have to disagree here.  I have NEVER grouped, soloed the entire<br/>
&gt;way, and have levelled about twice as fast as my Bard.<br/>
&gt;Enchanters start to suck at higher levels, because the resistance system is<br/>
&gt;messed up, so enchanters are getting large numbers of resists vs. green<br/>
&gt;creatures currently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find this really sad. During beta enchanters were very rare (well, high <br/>
level enchanters, anyways), but always a welcome addition. My dream party <br/>
combo would include an enchanter for sure.<br/>
I think my favorite mix for a full party is something like: A paladin or <br/>
ranger or warrior (preferably a ranger or paladin), Cleric, Bard, Enchanter, <br/>
Wizard, Druid. 2 spellchuckers, 2 healers, and 1 and 1/2 tanks =)<br/>
I think it works very well.<br/>
