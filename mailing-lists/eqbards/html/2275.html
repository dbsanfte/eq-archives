&gt;Selos, SoW, SoC, Consonant Chain, Snare, Enstill, Grasping Roots etc,  all<br/>
&gt;cancel out like effects, first in, first out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, Selos will cancel root for any member in the party, while leaving the<br/>
&gt;root icon in place for the normal duration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can also break yourself out of root indoors, by casting Consonant Chain<br/>
&gt;on yourself.  Sure, you move *very* slow, but at least you&#39;re moving..;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve also blasted myself off a ledge while rooted, using Bellow.  Bought me<br/>
&gt;enough time to escape as the mobs ran around and down to get at me again,<br/>
&gt;and hurt less than the pounding they were giving me.<br/>
