<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650691595">I use a tomhawk, and am currently trying to get rid of it. I have a low<br/>
stamina too, and when I berserk it takes me from a low 90 agi to a<br/>
horrible 77 agi. The weapon is terrible, but what I was really wondering<br/>
is how/why this guy wanted to trade? I&#39;ve seen claws go for large<br/>
trades, and currently wish I had one myself. That guy could&#39;ve gotten a<br/>
lot more than a tomhwak for it, so consider yourself lucky, as I wish I<br/>
could come across a guy that would do the same for me.<br/>

&gt; I do not think you have ever used a tomahawk so you do not know it bad side<br/>
&gt; effects.  I have a stam of 65, which make me slow down a lot after 2 fight<br/>
&gt; in a row.  If there is a third mob I am dead for.  But with claw I have<br/>
&gt; fought 4 barbed skeleton in Unrest and still have stam left over.  Second<br/>
&gt; thing, even though the proc give you a shield of 50-150hp, but with the mob<br/>
&gt; that I hunt at lvl 22 they can do more than the average dmg to me which goes<br/>
&gt; through the shield but when I used the claw I find that I get hit very<br/>
&gt; little.  As I increase in lvl the mob will hit a lot harder and I need all<br/>
&gt; the agi I can get.  Third, the weapon is very slow compared to the Claw.  I<br/>
&gt; hit like 4 times per melee without the dual wield.  In the end the dmg is<br/>
&gt; the same or better and it helps a lot against magic users which most of the<br/>
&gt; mob that u hunt at high lvl used magic.  This is my personal preference.  I<br/>
&gt; think the guy I traded it with was very happy with the trade and so was I<br/>
&gt; and I can always get another tomahawk at my lvl rather than wait till lvl 30<br/>
&gt; to get a claw.<br/>

&gt; My god trading a tomhawk for a claw?! WTF is that. I could never trade<br/>
&gt; my tomhawk for a claw. The market isn&#39;t flooded with em on Solusek Ro,<br/>
&gt; but a tommy for a demon claw is something that wouldn&#39;t happen here. I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t even find a worthwhile trade for my tommy anywhere on antonica.<br/>
&gt; Anychance the guy who you traded with has a seperate character on<br/>
&gt; Solusek Ro I could trade with, cause I&#39;d be VERY happy to do business.<br/>
