<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311134210">In our 4-5 hrs (we had to wait for a very nice 30+ level to kill him one<br/>
more time, then he watched over us breaking up the spawn, and left it to<br/>
us), he spawned 5 times.<br/>
<br/>
For a group of 3-4 lvl 21&#39;s it was challenging to hold the room since it<br/>
is on the train tracks for certain areas.  (If you cower in the corner,<br/>
the trains ignore you, but if you are fighting, its bad news).  When we<br/>
weren&#39;t being trained, the cleric and wizard would go kill the large<br/>
spider, while the bard and cleric whelp the scryer room...<br/>
