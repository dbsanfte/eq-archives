<div id="ygrps-yiv-809899412"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Dont post this crap here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually it wasn&#39;t exactly. Our spammer joined presumably many oneList<br/>
mailing lists then used Mail Out (version 25.3 :o) to spam us.<br/>
I only mention it because I have rarely seen a legit member of a mailing<br/>
list spam off topic stuff, and any fussing posted in reply  never reaches<br/>
the jerk, who doesn&#39;;t care anyway. A good list admin, like Talies t.W. will<br/>
do, well, just what he did.<br/>
Heh, now I kinda miss the days when with a good set of headers, dejanews, a<br/>
few tricks and some some social engineering could play amature Net sleuth<br/>
and actually catch the jerks. Gah, no more, too many people and too many<br/>
tools now for it to be easy. (My best hunt was when a jerk  got the email<br/>
addresses of some of the highest ranking people in my martial art, put em on<br/>
a mailing list and posted to rec.martial.arts the adress under the promise:<br/>
&quot;Talk to real live ninjas!&quot;. Imagine the quality, insightful email THEY<br/>
suddenly started getting).<br/>
