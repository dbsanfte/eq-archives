<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026224771">I have a P3 866 with a GeForce2MX running at 1280x1024 and I only see slow<br/>
downs when a lot of spell affects (multiple wizzie mana dumps) are going<br/>
off.  And of course the occaisional blip in NFP during peek times.<br/>
<br/>
I overclocked my 866 to 975 and only saw marginal improvement, so the better<br/>
the video card you can get the better off you will be.<br/>
<br/>
The GeForce2MX is also very overclockable.  Some overclock sites have seen<br/>
close to the GeForce2 GTS performance with the chip clock and memory clock<br/>
jacked up.   Beware, they added heatsinks and/or fans to BOTH the GPU and<br/>
the RAM on the video card.  Haven&#39;t done that yet, but am going to try it<br/>
soon.  Here&#39;s the link for those interested.<br/>

&gt; I am currently using the GeForce2 MX by Hercules (3D Prophet II MX) and<br/>
&gt; have been really happy with it.  They are going for about $149 at<br/>
&gt; Compusa.  You can also check out some great hardware reviews at<br/>
&gt; www.guru3d.com.<br/>

&gt; Get the best GeForce you can afford.  Currently, the 2 best<br/>
&gt; manufacturers<br/>
&gt; (IMHO), are Creative and Hercules.  Others may disagree...heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GeForce 3 is the newest and best out there.  If your budget is a bit<br/>
&gt; smaller, check out the GeForce 2 line.  Buyer beware!  Some of the<br/>
&gt; &quot;bargain&quot;<br/>
&gt; card manufacturers creatively label their cards such as they&#39;re not<br/>
&gt; untruthful, per se, but you could end up with a slightly different card<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; you thought you were getting, the difference usually being a slightly<br/>
&gt; different clock speed.  Do your homework, read some reviews, pick a<br/>
&gt; particular model, and don&#39;t look back.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I bought a GeForce256 DDR a little less than a year ago.  It&#39;s still a<br/>
&gt; superb card, I haven&#39;t found a game yet that&#39;s too much for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

&gt; Tallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not directly related<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; barding.  Bards do provide a lot of input into what is seen in game<br/>
&gt; graphically, so this can be an important topic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 16 MB AGP<br/>
&gt; graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; graphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram -<br/>
&gt; done.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards<br/>
&gt; they use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything<br/>
&gt; else<br/>
&gt; of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and some<br/>
&gt; places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t scrape<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again for all the help,<br/>
