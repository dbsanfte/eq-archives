<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561044016">How many of you fellow bards think our Hide and Sneak skills are<br/>
worthless?  I was hoping the changes they made to those two skills in<br/>
respect to rogues would also apply to us.  If you weren&#39;t aware, when a<br/>
rogue successfully hides, he now gets a message he was successful.  Once<br/>
a rogue is hidden, if he Sneaks successfully he can move silently and<br/>
invisible.  Very handy for their backstabs.  I don&#39;t see how adding this<br/>
feature to bards would unbalance us at all.  As it stands right now I<br/>
doubt many of us even use these skills.  However, when it comes to a<br/>
decision on which 8 songs to memorize, if we had this ability to<br/>
Hide/Sneak then that would be a factor in memorizing a different song<br/>
instead of the Invisibility song.<br/>
