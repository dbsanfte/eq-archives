<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938943995">IMO, any bard who kills treants is making life unnecessarily hard on themselves.<br/>
I have been told killing treants lowers your faction with druids (and don&#39;t want<br/>
to test it to find out:-).  Assuming that it is true, if you decide to kill<br/>
treants you most likely wont be able to use the druid rings for group<br/>
teleporting.  I&#39;ve got a druid friend who promised me free teleports for life<br/>
because I located and recovered her corpse out of the lava in Sol A.  No way I&#39;m<br/>
gonna give that up in exchange for the money and EXP treants give.  Too many<br/>
other places in the game for that.  Plus, I&#39;m a wood elf from Kelethin.  Seems<br/>
kinda evil to go around killing sentient trees when the foundation of your<br/>
hometown is distantly related to them.  <br/>

&gt; doesn&#39;t kill druids, treants, guards, dwarves at the docks, gnomes, etc...<br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t anyone care about faction anymore?  Or is it just players don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to take risks anymore...<br/>
