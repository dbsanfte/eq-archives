<b>Subject:</b> RE: End of Kiting? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654790901">I hate to disagree with (seemingly) everyone here, but<br/>
Im HOPING that Verant does something about Kiting.  It<br/>
may not be a problem on your server, but on MM, its<br/>
ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Case in Point:<br/>
   NRO - Constantly, every level 14 Druid Kites Dorn<br/>
to be the &quot;Great Dorn Slayer&quot;.  In the process, he/she<br/>
usually gets about 10 or so folks killed.  Usually<br/>
those folks are just level 8ish newbies who just didnt<br/>
have time to see Dorn come over the rise.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so you say that it&#39;s because at lev 14, they are<br/>
new to Kiting, and don&#39;t know how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Case in Point:<br/>
     Yesterday.  Three IDIOTS (and YES...I&#39;ll use that<br/>
term freely) decide to kite the Spectres in the Oasis.<br/>
 OOPS...pulled too many...lets just kite them all over<br/>
the Oasis till we run out of mana and then zone.  When<br/>
all was said and done...63 corpses.  No lie or<br/>
exaggeration...we COUNTED them. <br/>
<br/>
Big problem is, this is not an unusual scenerio.  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen more than a few &quot;Kited&quot; giants lose interest<br/>
(cause the Kiter got too far away) and rampage on<br/>
unsuspecting players WAY TOO LOW for a giant, and in<br/>
areas where Giants NEVER go...(like the NRO Fishing<br/>
villiage).  This effect is worse in those zones with a<br/>
lot of hills, where you cant see the mob coming until<br/>
its too late.<br/>
<br/>
Verant, in doing nothing to prevent this, AND allowing<br/>
the players no means of recourse, have been VERY<br/>
irresponsible.  I&#39;m glad to see them take a stand, or<br/>
at least attempt to.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t mind if you want to kite that Griffawn<br/>
at level 12.  Go for it.  But...DONT GET ANYONE ELSE<br/>
KILLED.  Too many Kiters don&#39;t care.  The phrase &quot;I&#39;d<br/>
rather see 20 people die and get away than lose the<br/>
exp for dying myself&quot; has been chanted by WAY too many<br/>
Shaman, Druids, and Bards out there.  No WONDER kiting<br/>
classes get a bad powerleveling rep.<br/>
