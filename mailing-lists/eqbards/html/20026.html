I read the thread and was appalled to see that bards, supposedly the best<br/>
group class according to &quot;The Vision&quot; were seldom listed as being desirable.<br/>
<br/>
This quote left me especially tanked off.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;A *good* Bard, i.e. one that puts away the stupid weapons and uses their<br/>
DoTs with instruments, managing mob agro properly, can add the the group.<br/>
But most Bards are clueless schmucks, so it isn&#39;t worth trying to educate<br/>
them as they flail away with their Yaks and no Double Attack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe tanked wasn&#39;t the right word to use there ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I have been emailed this thread by 6 people now!  A couple of them even<br/>
suggested it made sense and that since an enchanter was so much more vital<br/>
to a good group and basically rendered the bard obsolete, I should retire my<br/>
bard and work on getting one of my more viable classes leveled up.  It was<br/>
suggested, though never directly stated, that an enchanter made having a<br/>
bard more or less a waste of time unless you really needed manasong.<br/>
<br/>
Someone save me before I start screamin&#39; again.<br/>
