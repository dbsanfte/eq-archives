<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088997928">Medium bronze is dropped in Perma by elite goblin something or others, the<br/>
spot can be pretty tough considering what lingers around the area.  Ice<br/>
giant diplomat (however he is behind some doors so as long as you don&#39;t AE<br/>
you should be ok), Zaharn spawns in that spot as well and some others.  What<br/>
I would suggest you do is go to SolA and take the safe room zone to SolB.<br/>
It seems that greater kobolds drop medium bronze a lot more frequently than<br/>
the gobs in perma, plus the area is usually pretty safe.  A group of level<br/>
25+ or so can take out one kobold pretty easily, the higher you are the<br/>
better your chances though.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve seen maybe two pieces of medium bronze EVER. =) Ok, so where does it<br/>
&gt; drop? Someone asked me last night, upon telling him i made a SHD, &quot;Let&#39;s<br/>

&gt; addition, I&#39;d like to verify that SHD&#39;s do have class specific armor... is<br/>
&gt; it the Darkforge? If so, I&#39;ll just look it up on a eqshadowknights page or<br/>
&gt; something. No need to go into specifics, seeing this is a bard list.<br/>

&gt; Dark Reaver is SHD only right? Is Pain Bringer WAR only? It sticks in my<br/>
