<div id="ygrps-yiv-102973615">I hate this song.  It tend to want to put you on the lowest area of the zone<br/>
when you use it which would make it an awful choice for evacing in Unrest<br/>
because you may use to escape from a train in the second floor only to find<br/>
yourself in the basement next to a mortuary fungus and or a ghost.<br/>
<br/>
When you are near water and use it, sometimes it pops on the bottom of the<br/>
water - UNDER water.  It is ridiculous, I played with it once in Greater<br/>
Faydark around Felwithe because I thought that would be a safe area.  It is<br/>
supposed to have a greater distance with an instrument equipped but I did<br/>
not really notice that it did.  The only thing I like about it is the sound<br/>
it makes when you &quot;pop&quot;, in that sense it is good for a nice belly laugh.<br/>

&gt; Anyone ever found a use for this song? Moving around in <br/>
&gt; Solsek A would be a<br/>
&gt; good thing NOT to do with it...:o) Evacing a room in Unrest? <br/>
&gt; Anything useful<br/>
&gt; at ALL?<br/>
