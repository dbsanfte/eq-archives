&gt;Heh.  This is a great idea.  Next time you&#39;re doing a<br/>
&gt;Freeport/Qeynos/Freeport or Freeport/Kelethin/Freeport run,<br/>
&gt;put all your stuff in the bank (now that no-drops will go in),<br/>
&gt;and kill yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually in the first few months of retail I used this to set up a VERY <br/>
profitable trade run between Kelethin and Qeynos :)  In Kelethin (or <br/>
Steamfont) I would buy all the Mino Axes I could get my hands on (for 4 to 5 <br/>
plat).  Bank em and all my stuff, grap a drum and head to Qeynos. On the way <br/>
I would buy every low, medium and high bear/wolf skin I could find (lots of <br/>
bear skins in the Commons and Rivervale/Misty Thicket).  When I reached <br/>
Qeynos I would sell the Mino Axes for 8 to 12 plat each, then go talk to the <br/>
Millers and make wolf/bear belts, boots, and cloaks.  Bank em all and my <br/>
drum and then use the &#39;poor mans gate&#39; to get back to Kelethin.  I would <br/>
then sell the bear/wolf hide stuff to all the casters in Greater Feydark.  I <br/>
could make 150 to 200 plat easy in a day or two :) I made first trip at 6th <br/>
lvl in the second week of retail (would have gone in first but the servers <br/>
were alway down).  Running through East and North Karana then was a major <br/>
terror run: Evil Eyes, Cyclops, and Griffins (oh my!).  But I never died on <br/>
any of these trips, except for the time I tried to talk to the Sheriff in <br/>
Rivervale and forgot to hit enter first, lol.<br/>
