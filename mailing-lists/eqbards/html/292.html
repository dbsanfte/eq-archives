<div id="ygrps-yiv-294836270">Depends. Chords has a shorter range than Bellow. You also run the risk of<br/>
ticking off something that might wander by with Chords. If you can isolate<br/>
your creature and stand up to it then Chords is the way to go. Bellow works<br/>
better in busy locations and against runners.<br/>

Hey!<br/>
<br/>
This results are quite interesting. I am a level 15 bard and used to play<br/>
Jonthan&#39;s Warsong and Brusco&#39;s Bellow when soloing and Anthem de Arms /<br/>
Brusco&#39;s Bellow when fighting in team.<br/>
But now i&#39;m not sure if this is still the best combination, cause my<br/>
bellow does 8 dmg and I can start it just 2 times until i have to  restart<br/>
the<br/>
buff song. Maybe it would have more effect to switch between Chords of<br/>
Dissonance and the buff song cause the damage made by Chords until I have to<br/>
switch<br/>
back to the buff song would be higher than 16 points.<br/>
What do other bards think about that? What song combinations do you use<br/>
when fighting solo or in party?<br/>
