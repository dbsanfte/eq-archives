<div id="ygrps-yiv-570441013">In real life I&#39;m Beth Moursund, former Microsoft programmer, currently <br/>
Magic: The Gathering rules manager for Wizards of the Coast.  I was an <br/>
amateur bard in the SCA for 10 years, and played a harper on several <br/>
different Pern MOOs back when I was heavily into text-based online gaming. <br/>
 So the Bard was a natural character choice for me.  Also, I liked the idea <br/>
of a class that was designed to compliment a group.<br/>
<br/>
I have occasionally had trouble finding a group to party with, but most of <br/>
the time groups are very happy to have me join unless they already have <br/>
another bard with them.  Most players around my level on Solusek Ro are <br/>
very aware of the benefits of having a bard in the party -- especially the <br/>
monks.<br/>
