<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603297650">Hmm, this is not at *all* my experience and we spent a few hours hunting in<br/>
there last night.  That place is creepy as hell, especially if you are<br/>
watching Blair Witch Project while you are there!  This place DEFINITELY<br/>
adds atmosphere now and provides an outdoor zone for groups 30 to 50.<br/>

&gt; Gahk!  Have you been in Kith since the patch???  They have totally NERFED<br/>
&gt; it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It nearly completely light in there!  WTF? Man I needed some<br/>
&gt; spell to cloud<br/>
&gt; my vision!  Granted I do got  my clipping plane set to max<br/>
&gt; viewing distance<br/>
&gt; but come on now - this is ridiculous!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ugh - ugh  - ugh what are they doing??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It used to be one of the most totally scary zones we had.  Even if there<br/>
&gt; were no really bad mobs in there (after level 20/25 when ghouls<br/>
&gt; go green) it<br/>
&gt; was still scary - dark, foggy, ucky noises and all.<br/>
