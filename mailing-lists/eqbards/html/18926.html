<br/>
A new item was brought to my attention by a fellow bard in Freeport a few <br/>
days ago. A lute tuner (I forget the exact item name), is now sold by the <br/>
vendor inside the guild. It looks like a lute. I had previously found an npc <br/>
in Firiona Vie who sells 2 parts of a lute and 2 parts of a flute. This is <br/>
like the trumpet parts that are sold, I think in EC or N Ro. I have never <br/>
heard of anyone that knows how to assemble these pieces. I hail&#39;ed all the <br/>
bards in the FP guild with predicatable results, only the mail quest. I <br/>
wonder if these things can be crafted via a trade skill or are for quests.<br/>
<br/>
The latest newbie beg: I have gotten tells twice now from bards under L10 <br/>
asking if I would mind getting them a set of lambent armor. That would be <br/>
taking generosity to new heights.<br/>
<br/>
L51! woohoo travel song is fun, but pulling with it even sung kills pets.<br/>
