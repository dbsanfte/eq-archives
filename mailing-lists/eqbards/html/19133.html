<div id="ygrps-yiv-213942472">Doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m right or you are right on this, bottom line is that<br/>
Abashi is Verant&#39;s primary customer service rep and whatever he posts on the<br/>
Gameplay forum is often taken to be the gospel truth.  If he is going to<br/>
make a post on any issue, he had better make certain he has all his T&#39;s<br/>
crossed and I&#39;s dotted before he hits the Send button.  If he doesn&#39;t have<br/>
first-hand knowledge on the correct answer, then he needs to check with<br/>
someone who does before he replies.  Thats what most reasonable people would<br/>
do.  If he doesn&#39;t then he only opens himself and Verant up to criticism.<br/>
When he makes a post like he did today about twisting bard invis song all he<br/>
does is make himself and Verant look like they don&#39;t know what they are<br/>
talking about.  Since a lot of people already think Abashi and Verant are<br/>
clueless, situations like today only magnify the problem.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I&#39;m a part time player who only has 35 days total played since 11 April<br/>
1999.  But even though I don&#39;t play much I still read most of the EQ forums<br/>
on a consistent basis.  I&#39;ve also grouped with every class in the game on<br/>
numerous occasions.  I would be willing to bet I can tell you the major<br/>
issue/rant/complaint each class currently has.  I may not be qualified to<br/>
say anything about it since I don&#39;t play any class except a bard, but I<br/>
could at least tell you what the other classes are having problems with.<br/>
You would assume that someone who gets paid to do that full time would also<br/>
have a good idea on every class issue as well.  But we all know its not safe<br/>
to assume..<br/>

Wrong Galtin, he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Do you honestly think that our Ambassador&#39;s have any clue about how our<br/>
military works?  (our meaning USA or any other country lets not get into an<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not from your country&quot; fight)<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that spokesmen for microsoft fully understand the operating<br/>
systems?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think advertizing companies really know all that much about the<br/>
products they push for companies?<br/>
<br/>
Abashi is a Customer Service rep.  His job is to listen to problems and take<br/>
them to the people who know how to fix them.  He may, on occasion, offer<br/>
advice based on his experiences or come up with ideas on his own.  But you<br/>
cannot expect him to have firm knowledge of how every song and every spell<br/>
and every skill in the game works.  That&#39;s totally unfair.  He _does_ have<br/>
general knowledge about bards.  He knows we use instruments and have songs<br/>
that last far shorter durations than normal spells.  That&#39;s all he really<br/>
NEEDS to know.<br/>
<br/>
Give the guy a break for crying out loud.  I&#39;d love to see you do his job<br/>
better.<br/>

&gt; Agreed but if Gordon is the primary method for interaction between the<br/>
&gt; players and Verant on important issues then he needs to have a pretty good<br/>
&gt; idea of how all the classes work.<br/>

&gt; No it is an example of one person not knowing how our class works.<br/>
Gordon<br/>
&gt; != Verant.<br/>

&gt; &gt; In that case, you&#39;ll love his next reply...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can&#39;t twist invis with any other song... it negates it. That<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Doh! Shows you how much I know about bard songs  They are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; class in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game that I find the most mysterious.<br/>

&gt; &gt; LOL just another example of Verant not having a clue how our<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; work.<br/>
