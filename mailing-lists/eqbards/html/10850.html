In my own situation, My waitng list time is considerably reduced because of<br/>
the mana song. However, one thing you may have overlooked is that depending<br/>
on the system you are running, weaving :) 3 or 4 songs is extremely<br/>
difficult. I am still runiing my Old 233MMX with 64 megs of ram, and<br/>
honestly I am lucky if I can weave 2 songs on a good day. I am constantly<br/>
experimenting, but do I want to be a<br/>
&quot;purist&quot; or play and get some bubbles?<br/>
I say if they want the mana song and it gets me playin instead of waitin-<br/>
then hand me the throat spray and let me clear your mind my friend :)<br/>
