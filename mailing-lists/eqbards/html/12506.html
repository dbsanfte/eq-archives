&gt; spawked or the raiders get spanked doesn&#39;t seem to be a medium.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Did I say that?  My mistake... Oh wait, I just read all my sent mail.<br/>
  I never said that people died.  Oops, your mistake.  My guess is <br/>
  90% of the people made it out alive.  The people who were slain<br/>
  were the pet masters who were a little too careless.  If we fought<br/>
  the dragon and lost, that one thing.  I&#39;m not ashamed to say we<br/>
  got spanked, but no one f&#39;ing fought the dragon dude, heh.  That&#39;s<br/>
  the point you seem to miss.  Had the dominate server guild not<br/>
  stormed in and taken over, the 90% of the people alive would have<br/>
  regrouped and beat up Vox.<br/>
