<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-220089537">See my message that precedes this one.  I believe he is correct on this, I<br/>
can go to any dungeon, or any zone, doesn&#39;t matter where, I have yet to be a<br/>
monster magnet unless I play a AoE damage song, or Lullaby, other tha n that<br/>
I can pound on monsters and have a song playing and they will still attack<br/>
the ranger, or what ever other tank we have in the party, I usually do more<br/>
melee damage than anyone else in our party, with my dual wield and DragDirk,<br/>
and DwarvAxe I can usually slaughter just about any monster faster except<br/>
for the mages, they tend to out do me, but then they often regret that too,<br/>
monsters will jump on them long before they jump on me.  <br/>
<br/>
We were fighting Dvinn, I stayed behind him the whole time until our tank<br/>
and a mage were killed, then he finally came on me, I didn&#39;t stand a chance,<br/>
so it was a shout and run match back to the zone.....  Someone killed him<br/>
for me before I zoned, and I ended up with my Drag Dirk, and 17th level.  A<br/>
most excellent weapon for a bard, and even for a higher level mage, I tried<br/>
giving it to my low level wizard and he couldn&#39;t hit hardly anything with<br/>
it, so it definately takes a high piercing skill, so I took it back and gave<br/>
him a cracked staff to play with.<br/>

&gt; &gt;      OUCH!  If this is true then Weaving songs may not be the best of <br/>
&gt; &gt;      ideas.  More chances for a full damage hit.  Anyone else notice<br/>
&gt; this?  <br/>
&gt; &gt;      I will watch closely from now on but my general impression is that<br/>
&gt; he <br/>
&gt; &gt;      might be right...  Makes being a support bard make much more sense.<br/>
&gt; &gt;      If this is true (shudder) then this could change the whole<br/>
&gt; methodology <br/>
&gt; &gt;      behind running a bard character.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really hope that I am incorrect, but that would also explain why we are<br/>
&gt; attacked when starting up a song.  It makes us appear to be vulnerable<br/>
&gt; instead of being a threat.  I think I will try to check this out provided<br/>
&gt; my ISP doesn&#39;t lag me out tonight.  Hmm.. I think I will start a newbie<br/>
&gt; character tonight and do some trial runs attack very basic creatures like<br/>
&gt; bats to confirm this.  Though Chant is not a good thing to use since it<br/>
&gt; makes us harder to hit =).<br/>
