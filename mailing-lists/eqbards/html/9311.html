      The time of the old gods is at an end. With the passing of the age<br/>
      known as &#39;Betatest&#39;, and the coming of the next age, the old gods no<br/>
      longer hold power over the land of Norrath. A new breed of people<br/>
      calling themselves &#39;paying customers&#39; have settled the land and brought<br/>
      with them a host of new gods. Following is a listing I have compiled<br/>
      during my travels over the land.<br/>
<br/>
      Sorebottom O&#39;Boredom, god of camping. Sorebottom is a dull and lazy god<br/>
      who requires the same devotion from his followers. They worship him by<br/>
      sitting on their arses for hours or even days at a time at his various<br/>
      holy places like Highhold Pass, Temple of Cazic Thule, Najena, and Guk.<br/>
      His followers pay homage to him by auctioning off their goods to the<br/>
      highest bidder. Their prayer chants include &#39;Selling/trading rubicite<br/>
      for a good wizard item&#39;, &#39;Get in line&#39;, and &#39;You killstealing bastard,<br/>
      I&#39;ve camped this spot for 3 days straight&#39;. Sorebottom and his<br/>
      followers are the arch enemy of &#39;Wizfire&#39; Sorebottom is also worshipped<br/>
      by many of those that spend their life meditating and waiting to heal.<br/>
<br/>
      Wizfire, god of kill-stealing. Wizfire is an evil, selfish deity. He is<br/>
      primarily worshipped by wizards, but some druids and mages worship him<br/>
      also. Wizfire requires vast number of sacrifices to sate his hunger for<br/>
      blood, so his followers travel the lands killing everything in sight.<br/>
      He is the arch enemy of Sorebottom, with whom he shares a parasitic<br/>
      relationship. Both are worshipped in many of the same places, but<br/>
      Wizfire and his followers live off the same prey. Wizfire and his<br/>
      followers are hated throughout the land.<br/>
<br/>
      Nurph, god of class balancing. Nurph is a very feared god, more<br/>
      appeased than worshipped. He is like a plague, feared by all players,<br/>
      who live in fear that his chilling hand is not placed on their class&#39;<br/>
      head. Nurph requires sacrifices, which he gets primarily from druids,<br/>
      shamans, and necromancers in the form of spells and abilities. He has<br/>
      no worshippers or holy places, although his avatar, Arudune is<br/>
      sometimes seen stalking the land, looking for good spells or successful<br/>
      strategies to feed to his ravenous master. Nurph does seem to favor<br/>
      Rangers though so he tends to leave them alone.<br/>
<br/>
      Playorun Economie, god of trade skills. Playorun is a greedy god who<br/>
      takes his due from every successful trade skill in the form of profits.<br/>
      No skill is safe from his grasping hands, as he leeches the bank<br/>
      accounts of any foolish enough to try them. He is also worshipped by<br/>
      the many merchants in the land who buy items for but a fraction of<br/>
      their worth and sell them for hundreds of times their value. Whenever<br/>
      an enterprising mortal tries to outwit Playorun, by making money from a<br/>
      skill, he calls upon his brother, the god Nurph to smite the offender<br/>
      and any who would follow him.<br/>
<br/>
      Powyrgamyr, god of levelling. Powyrgamyr is crazed god, worshipped by<br/>
      hordes of raving, lunatics. These madmen roam the land killing<br/>
      everything in sight, never stopping, never sleeping, until they<br/>
      eventually drop dead from exhaustion. They are like a plague of<br/>
      locusts, destroying everything in their path in their mad quest to<br/>
      appease their god. Once a mortal gives his soul to Powyrgamyr, he<br/>
      breaks off all relationships, leaving friends and family behind, as<br/>
      they embark on their holy quests for experience, fame and wealth. Those<br/>
      that survive the quest, usually turn from Powyrgamyr and become<br/>
      worshippers of Twynker.<br/>
<br/>
      Twynker, god of newbies. Twynker is a kind god, worshipped by many<br/>
      newbies. The basic philosophy of the worship of Twynker is<br/>
      reincarnation. His followers believe that if they live a good and<br/>
      productive life, amassing wealth and items, they will be reborn into<br/>
      newbies, and be allowed to live off the gains of their previous life.<br/>
      As such, the followers of Twynker are viewed with jealousy and hatred<br/>
      by other mortals. They must endure much hatred and insults, but the<br/>
      consolation that they have better stuff than anyone else helps them<br/>
      cope. You can see Twynker&#39;s followers wherever there is a gathering of<br/>
      newbies. They are the ones killing rats, bats and fire beetles while<br/>
      dressed in full rubicite armor.<br/>
<br/>
      Roel Playor, god of perpetual low levels. Roel Playor is a benevolent<br/>
      god, worshipped by mortals through out the land of Norrath. They are<br/>
      well known for their verbose language and strange way of speaking. Most<br/>
      of them are kind, gentle beings who only want to live their lives in<br/>
      peace and harmony with the land and its inhabitants. However, their<br/>
      religion has recently been infiltrated by the followers of Wizfire.<br/>
      They are usually dark elves, trolls, and ogres who hide behind the<br/>
      teaching of Roel Playor, as an excuse to appease their god, Wizfire.<br/>
      These heretics are also known as azhoels</div>
