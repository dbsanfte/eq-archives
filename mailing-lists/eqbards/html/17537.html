Maybe a live bard that single wields is in the long run a better asset to<br/>
his group than the dead one that dual wields for half of the fight then<br/>
misses 2 fights on his way back (running or ressing) to the group. AC will<br/>
keep you alive longer - dual wield will get you dead faster. In your early<br/>
career, a single wield weapon with a shield may be lots better than dual<br/>
wield and dieing *alot* - you can only do damage when you are alive.  And<br/>
early on, all instrument in a group may not be your best choice.  Just<br/>
because you *can* dual wield does not mean you *must* dual wield al of the<br/>
time.  Bards have a great deal of flexibility so lets not limit our thinking<br/>
to only one way of doing things: dual wield until you die.<br/>
<br/>
The Orb is a great shield AC 15 and very light weight.  I bought a Chitin<br/>
shield (for 30pp? was a good deal I was on at 4am and seller was in a hurry)<br/>
when I was like 14-15ish and fighting asps in East Commonlands.  Without<br/>
thinking, I put it in a dimensional pocket.  I used to beg for dim pockets<br/>
and spirit pouches al lthe time.  Then &lt;system message&gt; the server are<br/>
coming down in 5 minutes!  log out now!  And so I did. &lt;poof&gt; went my Chit<br/>
shield.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I got 6 note blade and Yk.  But in fights with really strong mobs, if I<br/>
melee, I use 6 note and my shim orb.  That combo seems to moderate the<br/>
amount of attention I revieve from the mobs and my cleric does not have me<br/>
as an additional problem to heal.<br/>

&gt; Bards have dual wield before they can afford the item (twinks a side, I<br/>
&gt; gues sit has value to a twink).  And since you can&#39;t hold an instrument<br/>
&gt; with it, its pretty much worthless to them. </span></blockquote></div>
