<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563058257">I don&#39;t know for certain if the following is true but I have read in other<br/>
places that your singing ability has an impact on this song. At 7th level,<br/>
your max singing ability should be around 40.  As you singing ability<br/>
increases higher than 40, the effects of this song should also increase.<br/>
Can&#39;t confirm this because I&#39;m only at 6th level.  <br/>
<br/>
I assume this holds true for many other songs as well.  Does anyone out<br/>
there know for certain.  If I am incorrect, then what impact does singing<br/>
ability have on songs?  Does it decrease the monsters ability to resist the<br/>
song?  <br/>
<br/>
One other thing I have noticed.  The time it takes to scribe a song in your<br/>
spellbook increases based on the level of the song.  For me (6th level),<br/>
memorizing Chant of Battle only takes a few seconds but memorizing Hymn of<br/>
Restoration takes about a minute.  This can be a pain in the butt since,<br/>
everytime you get killed, you have to rescribe your spells.  Right now its<br/>
just an inconvenience but what happens when you get higher level songs?  I<br/>
assume, and hope, that as your singing ability increases the time it takes<br/>
to scribe songs in your spellbook proportionately decreases.  Can anyone<br/>
provide a definitive answer?<br/>
<br/>
And while I&#39;m on the soapbox, why did Verant make it where merchants and<br/>
guards attack you if you sing Chords of Dissonance in their vicinity?  I am<br/>
a wood elf from Kelethin.  I obviously bear no ill-will to the merchants and<br/>
guards of Kelethin.  They sell me goods and protect me from the evil orcs of<br/>
Crushbone.  But here is what happened to me the other day.  I was mucking<br/>
around the orc camp south of the entrance to Crushbone attempting to rid the<br/>
forest of the orc infestation.  I was going solo and was in the process of<br/>
fighting an orc centurion.  I was singing the Chords to help dispatch the<br/>
centurion.  I almost had him finished off when a guard spawned behind me.<br/>
He immediately killed me and then killed the orc cent himself.  To say the<br/>
least I was quite upset.  Guildmaster, guards and merchants /con red to me<br/>
so it would be stupid if I attacked them on purpose.  It seems to me that<br/>
these type of NPCs should be unkillable in the first place.  If I kill a<br/>
guildmaster then how will other players train?  I would be willing to bet<br/>
that they are unkillable, even by high-level players.  If they are<br/>
unkillable by players, IMO the Chords of Dissonance should have no effect on<br/>
them whatsoever and they should not attack PCs singing it.  Am I justified<br/>
in my opinion on this? Dissenting opinions are appreciated.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just hit level 7 and purchased Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong because I do<br/>
&gt; a lot of soloing.  I memorized and started it up and to my disappointment<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t notice a great skill boost.  In fact it only gave me 2 more<br/>
&gt; strength than the Chant of Battle and didn&#39;t give me any dex bonus.  Is it<br/>
&gt; really worth using.  Even if I have both songs going at the same time I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t notice any difference in my fighting ability.  I seem to do better<br/>
&gt; if I just keep playing the Hymn of Restoration.  Am I missing something or<br/>
&gt; did I just waste my platinum?<br/>
