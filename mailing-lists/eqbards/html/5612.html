 </span></blockquote>I visited Unrest last week and had no problems using Clouding<br/>
to sneak past undead.  I explored a good portion of the<br/>
basement using it, then I spent a good 3-4 hours pulling from<br/>
the basement using the song to scout ahead before pulling. The<br/>
song most definitely still works against undead - I would con<br/>
them and they&#39;d be in different to me.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, sometimes the hags cast see invisible on<br/>
themselves and other mobs.  Or if you end up with a buggy mob<br/>
aggressive to you (which shouldn&#39;t happen anymore with the<br/>
teleporting mob fix they put in), it and anything it alerts<br/>
will remain aggressive to you even if you&#39;re invisible.<br/>
Another possibility is that they changed the song so that the<br/>
invisibility to undead effect does not kick in until you reach<br/>
a higher level.  I&#39;ll have to as a bard friend that just got<br/>
the song to test it for me.<br/>
