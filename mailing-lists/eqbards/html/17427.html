<b>Subject:</b> More Grouping with an Enchanter advice wanted. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446532631">I know we recently talked about it but I am having trouble figuring out an<br/>
exact  strategy at 27.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior, 25<br/>
Shaman, 21<br/>
Necro, 27<br/>
Occasional Druid,Mid-thirties<br/>
Enchanter, 29<br/>
Bard, 27<br/>
<br/>
As you can probably guess, our group is put together based on a all being<br/>
friends and not on any strategy (I do plan to get the shaman caught up a<br/>
bit).<br/>
<br/>
The trouble I am having is what to do play given the Enchanter and that,<br/>
given the mix, I should probably be using weapons.  We have been hunting<br/>
Hill Giants but are moving into Sol A and so the rules are going to change a<br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
Anthem is voice, but of course the Enchanter can do the speed buffs.<br/>
DDD, CoD and psalm of warmth are weak with voice<br/>
Chains is weak using voice, and again, the Enchanter can cover that<br/>
Hymn is unfortunatly too weak without the lute to get the mob off the<br/>
Enchanter if she debuffs however, so we are thinking of me singing Chains.<br/>
I can practice charming, which might be fun.<br/>
<br/>
But basicly I have been singing weak DoTs, weak damage sheild and weak Hymn<br/>
to taunt off the Enchanter and feeling like I am being less than optimal at<br/>
my job. Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, pulling Flame Goblin Wizards while playing<br/>
Elemental/Guardian  with the Mistmoore Drum ROCKS, however I have had to<br/>
stop making chains my &quot;tag&quot; song, by the time he shows up I have switched to<br/>
weapons and the other night he droped me from one bubble down to dead with<br/>
no time for a screen refresh...PA_BOOM! Loading...please wait.<br/>
