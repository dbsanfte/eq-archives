LOL, but think you mean NHL since the ottawa senators play hockey, not<br/>
football. hehe<br/>

program? download?<br/>

they&#39;re everywhere i tell ya.<br/>

*looks over his shoulder*<br/>
*puts tin foil over his head*  &lt;-- simpsons episode where baseball league<br/>
was spying on consumers<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I doubt anyone saw this commercial (for NFL) for the Ottawa Senators<br/>
but its a parody of Sixth Sense. The 2 are in the car at a stop light, and a<br/>
crossing guard is helping kids cross the street and the kid in the car tursn<br/>
to his mom and says in a whisper &quot;i see hockey players&quot;. cracks me up every<br/>
time<br/>
