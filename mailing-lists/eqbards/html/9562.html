<div id="ygrps-yiv-542197789">The only problem with this though is with items like jboots or quest items.<br/>
People who camped drelzna for hours upon hours or the new Ancient Cyclops<br/>
are going to be very pissed when that item dissapears. Overall it&#39;s just not<br/>
worth it because it&#39;s going to cause people to put more time in this game<br/>
something Verant try&#39;s it&#39;s best to do.  Speaking of did you know according<br/>
to Verant hell levels are a feature?<br/>

&gt;I have seen the Langseax go for 15pp on Bertoxx also..have even heard of<br/>
&gt;people giving them away because they have so many.  1600 people on at peak<br/>
&gt;times..how many Warriors or Warrior twinks on the server?  At this rate the<br/>
&gt;Langseax is going to be virtually worthless in a short time..so something<br/>
&gt;needs to be done to take items out of the game.  I think decay over time is<br/>
&gt;a good idea.  I play a Warrior as well as a Bard and I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing<br/>
&gt;a repair skill added to fix weapons, armor, etc..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A short term fix to reduce the number of Langseax would be to put a switch<br/>
&gt;in.  Have a Frostbite for the Langseax and a &#39;Frostbitten&#39; (sorry its<br/>

&gt;&gt; me to another interesting issue in EQ. Namely the worth of equipment and<br/>
&gt;money.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I still remember when a Langeseax (1hs) would go for like 100pp on my<br/>
&gt;server,<br/>
&gt;&gt; but today I see them go for like 15pp because they are so common. This<br/>
&gt;goes for<br/>
&gt;&gt; allmost all equipment. There is NO real outlet as other have mentioned.<br/>
&gt;Once an<br/>
&gt;&gt; item is in the game it stays there.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think the only viable way to get items out of circulation is to make<br/>
&gt;them wear<br/>
&gt;&gt; out. If its possible to mend them it should be done by NPC&#39;s and be<br/>
