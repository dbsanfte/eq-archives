&gt; WTG on 30 Harm!!  You cant make money if you are so bz power levvving.  You<br/>
&gt; need to travel around and spend all your time in tells.  Fiting mobs really<br/>
&gt; slows down the money making and deal doing.  Once you get a decent amount of<br/>
&gt; capital and make some fiends with players who let you sell their stuffs and<br/>
&gt; if you like doing it - you can really roll thru the plats.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know.. you may deal with a lot of merchandise, but how much of it<br/>
is profit? Last night I made 300pp in under 3 hours.. and I wasn&#39;t paying<br/>
attention to loot. Admittedly I am high leveler (group was 35-40, me<br/>
being 40), but that proves that leveling DOES payoff. The higher level you<br/>
are the more loot you earn, almost exponentially.<br/>
<br/>
Some people really enjoy playing the merchant. I do sometimes, did it<br/>
during my teens as a smith. But these days, I enjoy getting exp AND great<br/>
loot without hassling with how much people want to pay or whether they<br/>
think I should give my real price up front or give too high a price so<br/>
they can haggle down or always list a price or not list a price.. gets<br/>
tiring. =)</div>
