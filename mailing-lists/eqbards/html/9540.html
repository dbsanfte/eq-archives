&gt; I made lvl 16 last night and thought I would head over to Highhold from<br/>
&gt; Oasis to pick up Aquatic Ayre. Having heard the stories about the GM event<br/>
&gt; and all the undead that had spawned in Kithicor I was more than a little<br/>
&gt; edgey about travelling through the forest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I entered the zone from West Commons the ground was covered with<br/>
corpses<br/>
&gt; that had yet to be reunited with their owners, needless to say this did<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; make me feel any better. I kicked up Selo&#39;s said a silent prayer to Karana<br/>
&gt; and bolted down the path to the South. Just passing the HighHold marker I<br/>
&gt; got a tell from someone asking me to hold a sec, so I did and was greeted<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; a Ranger who was looking for someone to do a corpse retrieval for a<br/>
friend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why take the path?  I&#39;ve always found it easier (and probably safer in these<br/>
times) to stay on the wall.<br/>
