&gt;Is it just me - or are some of the things NPCs allowed to do that we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;just really out of wack?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Seemingly endless manna<br/>
&gt;Seemingly limitless casting range<br/>
&gt;Able to affect folks WELL outside normal range limits<br/>
&gt;Able to have multiple pets<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lets see - anything I&#39;ve forgotten?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, it&#39;s not seemingly - it *is* limitless mana.  A guide friend of mine <br/>
confirmed that one...<br/>
And a few additions to your list:<br/>
Can cast while moving, Can open locked doors, can see through walls, can <br/>
attack from the bottom of the ocean, don&#39;t drown - ever, can chase you even <br/>
when blinded....<br/>
<br/>
And the list goes on....<br/>
