<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896682361">To add a pause, you put:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 30,<br/>
<br/>
In front of the command you want the pause to come after.<br/>
<br/>
For example, to play hymn which is in your 3rd spell slot and then stop the<br/>
song after the song has played your hotkey would look like:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 3<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
<br/>
The pause is counted AFTER the /cast 3 command.  Note that 30 equals 3.0<br/>
seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I have /pause 30 in all my hotkeys, but I have heard you can get away with<br/>
28 or even 26.<br/>
