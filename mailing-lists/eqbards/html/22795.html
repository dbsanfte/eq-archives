<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605977799">I must say charm (in this case) worked so much better than mezz for <br/>
	me. I was able to affectively keep 2 mobs busy and never got below <br/>
	half health the entire time.<br/>

In my own experience, this begins to change as you start fighting bigger and<br/>
bigger mobs.  I was in Old Sebilis near the pyramid last night without an<br/>
enchanter, and I was doing crowd control for my group.  If there was a two<br/>
pull, I would charm one as long as I could  (every now and then a lvl 52<br/>
frog would get pulled).  If there was a three pull or four pull (only<br/>
happenned once), I kept them all locked down with pixie strike (made 53<br/>
while I was there).<br/>
<br/>
The problem with keeping two mobs occupied with charm in the &quot;post-50&quot; world<br/>
is that the mobs hit so hard that when charm breaks, you cant last long<br/>
against two mobs beating on you at once, much less actually be able to sing<br/>
getting pounded on so severely.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite thing yesterday while my pet froggie shaman was fighting a<br/>
necrosis scarab (we did not have a shaman in our party) --  &quot;A necrosis<br/>
scarab yawns&quot;.  Nothing like having a pet shaman doing the slowing for you<br/>
