&gt; &gt; who claimed he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;lost his corpse&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really quite enjoy helping other people out.  I get a lot of <br/>
lower-level bards /telling me with questions (some of whom have done so <br/>
many times now) and I will always answer if I know (and will point them <br/>
to Harmonic if I don&#39;t, jk).  If you (Miriana? I lost the original <br/>
message) get some nasty response, then *that* player is a jerk, not *all* <br/>
higher-level players.  Try someone else on the list.  (/who all bard 40 <br/>

I&#39;ve had a lot of corpse retrieval requests lately, far more than I used <br/>
to, and I&#39;ve found these to be a lot of fun, too.  I always help on these <br/>
if it isn&#39;t going to hold up a group.  Takes me to areas I never had the <br/>
time (or nerve) to go to before.  See the world!<br/>
<br/>
I had a guy in Rivervale ask me if I could help locate his corpse and it <br/>
turned out that he had a high-level Druid that got wiped because he quit <br/>
for six months (characters don&#39;t last forever), and he wasn&#39;t aware of <br/>
the Kithicor changes.  It was a lot of fun to bring him up to date, and I <br/>
ended up giving him six pieces of banded/bronze armor to fill in what he <br/>
was missing *because he didn&#39;t ask*.  All of these, for me, are part of <br/>
the fun of being higher level.  What isn&#39;t fun is all the level 1 <br/>
beggars.  I really don&#39;t know where these guys get the nerve.<br/>
<br/>
When I play my lower level characters, I will /yell if in trouble, I will <br/>
flirt, I will give assistance, I will /moan if injured, but I will <br/>
*never* ask another player for money or items.  That just seems really <br/>
crass to me, and I don&#39;t think it should be rewarded (unless the player <br/>
is particularly amusing about it, which happens...)<br/>
