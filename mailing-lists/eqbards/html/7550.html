<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258646276">If you have a high level cleric who&#39;s meleeing, I suggest that its time to<br/>
find yourself a new cleric.   While these classes can melee somewhat at low<br/>
level, at higher levels, they are foolish to do so.  Every successful cleric<br/>
I know (including several level 50&#39;s) agree with this.  EVERY high level<br/>
cleric/shaman/druid I know, don&#39;t even carry weapons, but instead opt for<br/>
the paw of opolla/guardian shield combo.  They know their pathetic meleeing<br/>
abilities won&#39;t make any difference in the type of fight you run into at<br/>
this level, but a little more mana will.<br/>
These classes are very much pure casters.  Just becuase they&#39;re magic isn&#39;t<br/>
the same as the stereotypical wizard&#39;s, it doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not<br/>
pure casters.  At level 50, a cleric/shaman/druid will be just as useful<br/>
meleeing as a wizard is, which is to say, not at all.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest for those of you that insist on calling these classes hybrids, get<br/>
yourself a good ol dictionary and look up the definition of the word.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean what you think it does.  <br/>

one that some people on this list share with you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; SHD, RNG, PAL are hybrids.  the priests are not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why aren&#39;t they? They aren&#39;t pure caster classes and<br/>
they are not pure fighting classes - they do both and<br/>
do both fairly well. What is a priest ability? There<br/>
isn&#39;t one. There&#39;s not &quot;casters, fighters and priests&quot;.<br/>
There are &quot;casters&quot; and there are &quot;fighters&quot; and there<br/>
are a mix of the two.</div>
