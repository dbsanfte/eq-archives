&gt; 12-15 Kurns Tower <br/>

&gt; love being hasted)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 15-20 Unrest <br/>
&gt; (I never hunted there before as my previous computer couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; handle it)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 20-25 Lake of Ill Omen <br/>
&gt; (I took Tszaaz from 25-30 there, it might get tedious, might not)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not feeling particularly inspired by this list however. <br/>
&gt; If anyone has<br/>
&gt; suggestions for when, as a bard, to go where I would <br/>
&gt; appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m entirely unqualified to give you advice, but I would like to know why<br/>
you feel Blackburrow is such a good dungeon for bards.  I&#39;ve found it to be<br/>
lag-city (2 song max) and have not been able to successfully hunt there with<br/>
either my bard, shaman, wizard, or rogue.  I understand it&#39;s a good spot for<br/>
a necro though.  But then, what isn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
