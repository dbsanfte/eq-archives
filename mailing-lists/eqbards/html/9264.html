&gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do not know if this has happened on other servers or not <br/>
&gt; but just thought<br/>
&gt; I would let yall know incase anyone has any more information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other night on the plane of fear(not me)  groups killed Lord Cazic<br/>
&gt; Thule. Alot of the heros were friends of mine and non bards <br/>
&gt; MUHAHAH  and<br/>
&gt; were extremely excited as to its loot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well their excitement turned to dissapointment when the only <br/>
&gt; loot on the<br/>
&gt; monster was two(2) Picolos (fyi smaller version of a flute).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There were 2 level 50 bards that assisted and they got the <br/>
&gt; instraments. That<br/>
&gt; for now is the extent of my knowledge BUT I am EXTREMELY curious about<br/>
&gt; these.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dont know if he has been killed on other servers but if <br/>
&gt; anyone knows any<br/>
&gt; information that would be great.<br/>
