This seems to refute the findings that John Kim came up with<br/>
when he did the Mana Song vs. Mana Song/Heal Song twist test.<br/>
<br/>
If I can recall correctly, he found NO difference between singing<br/>
the mana song by itself versus singing the mana song with the heal<br/>
song mixed in.<br/>
<br/>
Did I miss something ? GZ seems to imply that &quot;If she aint<br/>
singing it, the finger wigglers arn&#39;t getting their crack&quot;<br/>

&gt; Subject: From EQCasters (and added to the FAQ)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of <br/>
&gt; Clarity)?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A: There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an <br/>
&gt; icon on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>
&gt; seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration -<br/>
&gt; this means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially<br/>
&gt; keep the song effect going indefinitely.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the <br/>
&gt; Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again. <br/>
&gt; Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it <br/>
&gt; does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your<br/>
&gt; screen. </span></blockquote></div>
