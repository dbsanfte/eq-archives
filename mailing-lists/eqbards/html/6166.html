&gt; 	Err... No. Hoods are both more expensive and much harder to get. They may<br/>
&gt; be *faster* to get, but much harder. Turbins ran for about 400 plat on Cazic<br/>
&gt; a week ago and I *think* hoods were around the 800 mark.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Having hunted both, I greatly disagree. Unless someone on Cazic has<br/>
Hatar&#39;s spawn time and location figured out, the hood is the common drop<br/>
from the executioner that spawns several times a day. As to the prices<br/>
you quote, in terms of the hood&#39;s stats, it could easily sell<br/>
for a lot more dispite the rarity of the other. Hell, I had the first<br/>
hood on Tarrew Marr and was offered my choice of a rubi tunic or a<br/>
fishbone earring for it in trade. A week later when it was known how<br/>
common a drop they were, I doubt I would have had a hope of getting that<br/>
deal (needless to say I took the tunic)<br/>
