&gt; &gt;Did anyone else notice the &quot;you feel as if you are about to<br/>
&gt; &gt;become visible&quot; message with invisibility?  Of course Clouding<br/>
&gt; &gt;pulsed again before I became visible.  I have to wonder if<br/>
&gt; &gt;this fix (message 5 sec before invisibility blinks off) didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;just make Clouding 100% reliable...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you mean 100% reliable?  Explain for the slow members of our<br/>
&gt; audience (ie, ME.)<br/>

time.  Since there are 6 seconds between invisibility pulses,<br/>
that is 6 seconds of vulnerability between pulses.<br/>
<br/>
Now there&#39;s a message that appears a set amount of time before<br/>
it flickers off.  For this to work, the game must determine<br/>
that your invisibility will flicker off, give you the message,<br/>
wait a set amount of time, then flicker off.  I noticed that<br/>
when I got the message, my invisibility did *not* flicker off.<br/>
So it seems our song pulses &quot;refreshes&quot; the invisibility and<br/>
overrides this determination that it will flicker off.<br/>
<br/>
So if the time between the message and flickering is 5<br/>
seconds, with 6 second pulses, that leaves 6 - 5 = 1 second of<br/>
vulnerability to this happening.  If the time for the message<br/>
is 6 seconds or more, our invisibility can never flicker off<br/>
because it will *always* be &quot;refreshed&quot; before it can flicker<br/>
off.<br/>
