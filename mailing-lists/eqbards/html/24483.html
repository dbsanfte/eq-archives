<div id="ygrps-yiv-755134413">Can we send NPC&#39;s or any critters we charm against other players as well?<br/>
That WOULD seem pretty powerful.<br/>
<br/>
And from what I&#39;ve read/heard, we used to be able to charm other players,<br/>
but I can see why they would take that away...that would be a little tough.<br/>

Charm is an extremly powerful ability.  Our charm can be very overbalancing<br/>
since mobs hit so damn hard at high levels and we have the ability to<br/>
recharm while getting the crap beat out of us.  Be happy they gave us the<br/>
new charm :-)  It&#39;s sad that I am pretty retiring the song at this point<br/>
(too many mobs too high lvl now), but I really can understand why the<br/>
limited us...<br/>
