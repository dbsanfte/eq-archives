<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538712438">Please don&#39;t ask guild clerics to run halfway across the world to rez you<br/>
(or even up from the deep part of the dungeons) Its rude and it impinges on<br/>
THEIR time. Esp because, if they are guild, they don&#39;t feel like they can<br/>
say No. A guild&#39;s purpose is not to provide teleporters/rezzes. If you want<br/>
these, get in a group where one of your members can do it.<br/>

&gt;Get in a guild with level 49+ clerics and get a decent amount of xp back<br/>
&gt;when they res you.<br/>
