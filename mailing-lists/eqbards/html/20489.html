<div id="ygrps-yiv-486289628">Because FV is a long way from NRo or Lake Rathe, and I needed to make sure<br/>
my brass was maxxed, I went to the Warrior&#39;s guild in FV and went down the<br/>
tunnel until I was knee deep in the water and started up screech with my<br/>
trumpet equipped.  I was able to play for 8 hours uninterrupted.<br/>
