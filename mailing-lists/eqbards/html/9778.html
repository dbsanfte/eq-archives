<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-296535865">The general consensus for what i have heard (this is all 2nd hand, so please<br/>
don&#39;t attack me if you disagree) is that the Berserker Strength effect on the<br/>
PGT becomes a detriment in the mid-high 20&#39;s when mobs start rolling over the<br/>
sheild.  Essentially, the -20[?] agility becomes something like a free hit for<br/>
the mob fighting you {especially if it drops you below an agility<br/>
Breakpoint..my agility is 93, so the proc would drop me below 75, which means<br/>
that i personally would lose over 30 pts of AC...that is BAD}.  And, even if<br/>
this is exaggerated, it really is a poor weapon (based on dmg, Delay and<br/>
weight). I would definitely be using the BLW and the Silvery War Axe (or the<br/>
dirk and war axe).  Of course, you are high enough to go get yourself Demon<br/>
Claws, which seem pretty spiffy to me.  or that fancy SharkJaw Cutlass in Kedge<br/>
Keep...in a group w/higher lvls than you.  (should be easy to assemble a mid<br/>
40&#39;s kedge group that will let you in for the mana song alone....)<br/>
<br/>
bottom line, at 35 i would not be using a pgt.  In fact i was offered one at 23<br/>
for a reasonable price, but i turned it down because from what i have heard, it<br/>
will only be really good for me for a few (3 to 4) levels.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
