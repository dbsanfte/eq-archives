&gt; &gt;Mabey I am being overly cynical but...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hooray for you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Honestly..EQ is boring.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I dont want it to be, but it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; maybe you should make some friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>eh, mabey youre right.<br/>
However, I dont play enough to make permanent friends.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; you could always log at the uncrowded zone.  why would you day after day<br/>
 </span></blockquote>log in<br/>

 </span></blockquote>/boggle<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well...mabey youre right again.<br/>
However lets look at it like this.  Youre in the lake of ill omen<br/>
wanting to hunt, but you log in at the wrong time and the place is crawling<br/>
with people, no fun.<br/>
<br/>
To get to another zone near my level I would have to hop on the boat or log<br/>
out.<br/>
There is no real soloution to this really.  I only wish they would make more<br/>
stuff spawn when there are<br/>
a lot of people in zone.  That would be nice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;If you keep on playing, what else is there to do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hang out with my friends, visit new zones, find new quests, get cool new<br/>
 </span></blockquote>equipment,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; play different characters...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I should have said.  If you keep playing what else NEW is there to do.<br/>
New equipment?  Sure if you wanna sit on a spawn for a decade.<br/>
Quests?  ok, quests can be fun, but too few of them are worth it and<br/>
once they are done they are pretty much done.<br/>
<br/>
Play different characters...ok you got me here, this can be fun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;have all the best gear, will it have been worth it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; sure, cuz i had fun on the journey there.  if your only goal in eq is to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; equipment, i feel sorry for you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again youre right about this I guess.<br/>
I DO ahve fun sometimes...however I find myself getting more and more<br/>
jaded as time goes on.   Mabety I need an EQ vacation?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;I doubt it.  Save your money and your sanity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you mean you will save your money and sanity right?  i know you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be telling other<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what to do with their money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok...Im not afraid to admit that I was saying some rash things.<br/>
I have been feeling burned out on EQ lately and after reading the way that<br/>
VI swept the lullaby fix under the carpet...well...I let myself get out of<br/>
hand..:P<br/>
<br/>
In perfect honesty, to me the bard is the saving grace of EQ.<br/>
FUnnest class I have played ( ok monks are pretty fun too IMHO ).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for using the mailing list as a punching bag.<br/>
Can you ever forgive me? *sniff sniff* :(</div>
