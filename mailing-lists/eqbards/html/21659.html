<br/>
Sorry to interrupt your day with off-topic prattle, but I did want to <br/>
address something important.<br/>
Some of you may have heard already, but for those who didn&#39;t, a player on <br/>
Brell Serilis (my current home server) was banned for a roleplay story she <br/>
wrote and posted to a non-Sony affiliate board.  Please don&#39;t respond with <br/>
your &quot;they deserved it&quot; or &quot;Verant should be bombed!&quot; flames, I don&#39;t want <br/>
to start a thread about it.  If you&#39;re interested in the full story, Lum <br/>
seems to have most of the details at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/">http://lum.xrgaming.net/</a><br/>
<br/>
Basically what I wanted to do, as co-moderator of this list, was to warn <br/>
you that anything you say can (and will, apparently) be held against you by <br/>
Verant.  This list is designed as a private list for subscriptions, etc, <br/>
but is open to the public for archive reading.  Consider this a word to the <br/>
wise.  I may even add this to the list FAQ :(<br/>
