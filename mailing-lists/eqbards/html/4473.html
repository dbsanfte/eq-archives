<div id="ygrps-yiv-321234032">&quot;Enhancing pottery - or did anyone win the EQ lottery last night&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In Verant&#39;s valiant crusade against those evil, evil craftspeople that<br/>
actually *gasp* make a small profit for all their trouble - today we get a<br/>
patch that turns a 4g profit into an 8g loss.  But wait - perhaps they were<br/>
just trying to save us time because low and behold - many people - many<br/>
that AREN&#39;T potters saw this coming and this morning are 8000 plat, yes<br/>
PLAT richer.<br/>
<br/>
8 characters - 16 slots - 8 slots per backpack - 20 sketches per slot.<br/>
<br/>
By my calculations buying a 1s 1c sketch selling at 4 GOLD 2 c - that&#39;s -<br/>
oh roughly 8007 PLAT profit.<br/>
<br/>
And oh yeah - remember they did this to us for &#39;the good of the economy<br/>
cause we were makin to much money&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I figured when I did pottery I made, oh maybe 15-20 plat an hour &quot;OH MY<br/>
GOD, SOMEONE IS MAKING A PROFIT&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, boost that figure to a generous 30plat an hour - 8007 - hmmmm, what&#39;s<br/>
that 266 hours of work someone didn&#39;t have to do? And to top it all off,<br/>
this has been all over the boards - and people that AREN&#39;T POTTERS been<br/>
investing in these like stocks.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I had some stocks that paid off this well overnight.</div>
