<div id="ygrps-yiv-117297227">hehehe!  Yah, I guess I wasn&#39;t very clear about that part.  I also play a<br/>
druid and a warrior, so there are lots of times when I&#39;m not the bard or the<br/>
enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I also agree with the idea that most of those bards aren&#39;t here.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; then I&#39;m gonna assume they are the one clueless about their class, not me.<br/>
&gt; I will however likely have songs memmed to bail them out in the event they<br/>
&gt; get in trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now if there is no enchanter in the group and the bard can&#39;t perform basic<br/>
&gt; crowd control because he doesn&#39;t know how, then you have a case.<br/>
