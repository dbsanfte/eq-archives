<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Player wipe on Test <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931328031">from what i heard a large reason that the wipe was done was that there was a bug<br/>
introduced onto test where all the kobolds in sol b were dropping dragon loot.  instead<br/>
of reporting the bug (hello, test server), players decided to go farm it instead.  yet<br/>
another case of greedy players spoiling it for the rest of us.  because of that, i don&#39;t<br/>
think option 2 is viable, unless they use a character backup from a month or so ago.<br/>

&gt;In case some of you don&#39;t know, the entire player-base on the Test server<br/>
&gt;was wiped yesterday.  Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>
&gt;conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>
&gt;from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for those<br/>
&gt;that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character over<br/>
&gt;the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;heard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lyrnia, you had a high level Bard on test, didn&#39;t you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I read on the Gameplay board this morning that Brad is taking suggestions<br/>
&gt;on:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Offering players to move their characters onto the live servers without<br/>
&gt;their items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>
&gt;stinks nonetheless.<br/>
