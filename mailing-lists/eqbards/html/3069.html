<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459593713">Wow, kinda disillusioned with EverQuest right now?<br/>

&gt; could get into parties at level 20 because of all the damn twinks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At  a meager level 13, I grouped with several lvl 20+ characters the other<br/>
day in Highpass who were delighted to have me in the party.  Of course I got<br/>
no xp, but that was never my intention.  (I did make about 20pp in just<br/>
under an hour and bought my Dragoon Dirk for essentially no out of pocket<br/>
expense.  Hehe!!)  I didn&#39;t even have to fight, just equipped my lute, made<br/>
sure I was within range of them all as they were fighting, twisted heal with<br/>
anthem and ocassionally tossed in a bellow on the rare orc that conned less<br/>
than red to me.  Their downtime was so minimal, it was sick.  I was<br/>
constantly getting &quot;I love bards&quot; and &quot;I love this song!&quot;  They were<br/>
actually getting bored waiting for the next orc train to show.  Which was<br/>
pretty cool considering when I first arrived, they had all just sprinted out<br/>
of the zone away from a train!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Doh, so close to actually saying something positive about the bard in<br/>
EverQuest.  No offense, but if you want to put in your 2cp on how bad you<br/>
believe the bard is, please reserve your comments to those which might<br/>
actually be helpful or, save it for the message boards.  The vast majority<br/>
of the people on this list LOVE their bards and play them religiously.  Some<br/>
even continue to add postive input to the list long after their bard has<br/>
played out or achieved lvl 50 (Much Congrats Shada!!!!)  I love this list<br/>
for all the useful info I get.  I don&#39;t want to hear how bad I am going to<br/>
suck when I get to level X.  Seems that we have several people here that<br/>
have experienced quite the contrary.<br/>
