&gt; &gt; try to pick locations where the group can get started on easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; creatures and<br/>
&gt; &gt; get a feel for things before taking on tougher fights and<br/>
&gt; &gt; risking death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Getting a group to do this has been one of the most difficult things for<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; to do.  I must be presenting myself in a way that makes me sound cowardly.<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;m glad to know I&#39;m not the only one who thinks this is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Hehe.  It might seem cowardly to some.  To a bard, it&#39;s common sense since<br/>
you&#39;re the first one to die when things go bad. ;P<br/>
<br/>
This is how I try to start a group.  First, I don&#39;t suggest taking on easy<br/>
things to get started.  Even though it makes good sense, it&#39;s not very<br/>
inspiring if your leader is a coward. ;P I just set things up so it ends up<br/>
that way for the first fight. :)<br/>
<br/>
Before the first battle, I make sure that everyone is full mana and full<br/>
life.  I suggest roles for each person in the group and get people&#39;s<br/>
consensus about who will do what (eg person to /assist in multi-mob fights,<br/>
primary damage absorption tank, puller, healer, nuker, who will keep up<br/>
which buffs on whom, etc.)  I also usually briefly explain basic<br/>
communication and mechanics (eg. INC, MR?, how to set up an /assist hotkey,<br/>
etc.) since most of the time, I&#39;ve grouped with newbies or people who don&#39;t<br/>
have much experience grouping and it always helps communication when<br/>
everyone understands a common vocabulary of abbreviations. ;)<br/>
<br/>
For the first battle, I try to set things up so that the group is taking on<br/>
one yellow or maybe a few blues and I try to make sure there is very little<br/>
risk of anything else joining in. (eg if pulling from a camp, fight far away<br/>
from the camp but not in the path of any wandering creatures.)  Taking on a<br/>
few blues or a yellow usually doesn&#39;t seem easy to most individuals -- when<br/>
solo, multiple blues or a yellow con is tough for most classes even though<br/>
it should be easy for a fully working group. ;)<br/>
<br/>
After the battle is over, I check on everyone&#39;s mana and health.  If<br/>
everyone played well, everyone&#39;s health and mana should recover around the<br/>
same time and there will be little downtime.  Usually, that doesn&#39;t happen<br/>
unless I&#39;m grouped with good players.  Normally, the group ends up waiting<br/>
for one person&#39;s health to recover while everyone else is uninjured or the<br/>
group ends up waiting for a caster to recover their mana while everyone else<br/>
is ready.  It&#39;s natural.  Casters often don&#39;t know how much damage a good<br/>
tank can absorb so they overburn to finish a fight quickly, like when they<br/>
solo.  Also, some tanks don&#39;t know to back off and spread around the damage<br/>
figuring that they are a tank and should be taking all the damage, like when<br/>
they solo.<br/>
<br/>
Analysing the first battle, I diplomatically suggest a different strategy<br/>
for anyone who is taking too much damage or burning too much mana and set up<br/>
the first battle scenario again (easy fight that still gives XP) until<br/>
everyone is fairly well balanced.  This has the added advantage that I, as<br/>
the bard, don&#39;t die if the group sucks because we keep on taking easy fights<br/>
over and over that still give some XP. ;)  Usually, within one or two<br/>
battles, the group is working well as a team and we start to take on tougher<br/>
fights.  That&#39;s normally when I try to develop an escape plan for the group<br/>
if things go bad but I often forget since we are normally having a lot of<br/>
fun by then. =)<br/>

&gt; You were looking for a last name, right?  How do you pronounce the first?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to pronounce it - it&#39;s an autogenerated name for a male<br/>
wood elf. I&#39;m terrible with names. :)  I guess it would be pronounced<br/>
an-loo-il.  I was thinking of Lumiaria for a last name since it kinda flows<br/>
with the first name and sounds elvish.<br/>
