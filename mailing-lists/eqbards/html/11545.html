Speaking of the hero bracer.  I traded mine a month ago for a Mistmoore Battle drum.  Now I&#39;ve gone back<br/>
to try to get the bracer again.  How does one get the mino hero to spawn?  EQLizer says you need to kill<br/>
meldrath and his guards.  But we certainly didn&#39;t do this the first time (and no one else was, that I&#39;m<br/>
aware of).  And their other information about it is obsolete as well, listing Meldrath as a 29th level<br/>
necro, and his guards as level 38.  (Those number are roughly reversed now).  So does anyone know the<br/>
trick?  It&#39;s one of those linked spawn deals.  I&#39;m pretty sure I know where he pops...the skeleton spawn<br/>
location to the left and slightly behind the giant gear when facing the closed end of the valley.  But<br/>
I&#39;ve camped there for many hours now, and he hasn&#39;t popped.  Also, shouts to the zone have revealed that<br/>
none of the level level folks hunting in the area have seen the hero spawn for quite some time.  Any hints<br/>
will be appreciated.  Next time I try, I&#39;m gonna go for the &quot;kill everything in sight&quot; method.  Though I&#39;m<br/>
not capable of doing meldrath and his cronies by myself.   I&#39;d need a group of 6.  (Whereas I can kill the<br/>
mino hero with just me and my level 30 cleric friend.)  Thanks!<br/>
