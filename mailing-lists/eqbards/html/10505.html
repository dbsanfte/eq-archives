<b>Subject:</b> Lute of the Gypsy Princess and other lutes. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-638123577">Last night me and a druid friend raided Castle Mistmoore.<br/>
  <br/>
  I got the Gypsy Lute and the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, so<br/>
  I know have three lutes in my inventory.  I decided to test<br/>
  them each out, again, for kicks.  Maybe Verant adjusted them<br/>
  during the last patch, I thought.  Or not.  heh.  The normal<br/>
  lute, the gypsy lute, and the LotGP all did 17 hp recovery<br/>
  with Hymm.<br/>
<br/>
  Maid showed up (fangless) so we handed the wreath to another<br/>
  friend.  And the Butler never did spawn.<br/>
<br/>
  I also died in the attempt, when Ms. Davassi surpassed all<br/>
  level boundries and charmed my druid friend who was oh...<br/>
  20 freakin levels higher than her.  Damn cheating NPCs.<br/>
  Needless to say, a level 50 druid casting starfire on you<br/>
  will knock the stuffing out of you.<br/>
<br/>
  You feel the gaze of the heavens. <br/>
<br/>
  (translate:  You just lost 3 bubbles of health)<br/>
<br/>
  In the current situation, deep in the castle, running was<br/>
  a bad idea, so I found my little corner and waited for the<br/>
  last starfire to hit.  One death is worth the lute to me.<br/>
  Plus we got a variety of other trinkets, AND I got a cute<br/>
  screenshot of me as a dead wolf.<br/>
