&gt; &gt;It funny, but I was just reading a statistical analysis of the EQ player<br/>

&gt; &gt;Something to do with women exploiting the social aspects of the game where<br/>
&gt; &gt;men just powerlevel and get phat lewtz.  Buggered if I can find that link<br/>
&gt; &gt;now though, sorry.  It was the same sort of stereotypical stuff as listed<br/>
&gt; &gt;below.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That link was actually used as fodder for this article, and was cited:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Skimming the article, a bizarre statistical quirk appears...69% of women play<br/>
with a &quot;romantic partner&quot;, while only 16% of men do.<br/>
<br/>
So who the hell are the partners the additional 53% of women are playing<br/>
with? Shouldn&#39;t the two numbers for the two sexes be nearly identical? Are<br/>
52% of the women lesbians, 26% playing with the other 26%?<br/>
<br/>
More likely this shows the invalidity of the entire survey, because the<br/>
voters are self-selecting, and a different kind of female chooses to waste<br/>
his time taking the survey than male. My wife not only wouldn&#39;t take it, but<br/>
(she&#39;s quite controlling, and our greatest source of tension is that I cannot<br/>
be controlled) she actually complained that I was wasting time when she saw<br/>
me taking it.<br/>
