<div id="ygrps-yiv-948104339">That&#39;s what I thought too at first.  However my bard has spent over 10 times<br/>
as much time in Lake of Ill Omen foraging and has never gotten any of the<br/>
unusual items that my Iksar has gotten.  My Iksar has at least a half dozen<br/>
mud crabs for example, but Kit has not foraged a single one, even during the<br/>
two evening where all I was doing was pulling for our lower level members,<br/>
doing charm tricks, and foraging.  Both our ranger and druid who have forage<br/>
over 100 have gotten them though and they have spent far less time there<br/>
than I have.<br/>

Your iksar isn&#39;t foraging specials.  Evidently in certain zones you have a<br/>
chance of foraging a few wierd items regardless of what your forage skill<br/>
is.  (Note these are different than the &#39;special&#39; stuff that rangers and<br/>
druids are capable of pulling out of their assets)<br/>

&gt; I want higher forage so I can forage some of the special items, also to<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; foraging less button pressing intensive (I already have 100 times the<br/>
button<br/>
&gt; twiddling of any other class, why would I want more?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even if our forage capped at 100 we would only very rarely ever get a<br/>
&gt; special item.  At 55 if I keep hitting.  Now that I have money I really<br/>
&gt; rarely care enough to do that.  Be nice if the rumours ae true to actually<br/>
&gt; be able to forage that Burynai Bundt Cake myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s the deal with Iksar foraging anyhow?  My Iksar shaman can forage<br/>
&gt; specials like a madman and yet his forage is below average, worse than my<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; Everyone seems to be using Summon Food and Drink as the prime examples of<br/>
&gt; uselessness.  Well aren&#39;t we the class that has been complaining rather<br/>
&gt; loudly for over a year that our forage was capped so darned low?  Well<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t we?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Warrior Greaves cast Invisibility.  That&#39;s cool, but we have a song for<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; guys.  Think about it, we *don&#39;t* have songs that can summon food and<br/>
drink.<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s kinda nifty, but I will admit that I hope the BP casts Gate.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be perfectly happy to accept the lower AC if the effects given were<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; any way in balance to those gained by the other classes.  Point<br/>
&gt; &gt; is they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; not, in fact they patently suck.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Being able to Summon Food and Water is totally a joke.  It would be a<br/>
joke<br/>
&gt; &gt; if it were on armor I could get at 28th level.  At 50+ it&#39;s extremely<br/>
&gt; &gt; insulting.  I&#39;m not sure how anyone could reasonably defend that it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; really useful to have at 50+.  What do we have now, Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt; clones?  Please.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why would characters who have been leaving behind 5pp weapons for<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10+ levels<br/>
&gt; &gt; because they were trash loot suddenly care about 6cp muffins and milk?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Great, now we can save everyone in our party 1.2 sp a day, whoopee.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Enduring Breath is minorly useful.  Is it anywhere near as useful<br/>
&gt; &gt; as +25 STR<br/>
&gt; &gt; or Invisibility is to a warrior?  No.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am more irritated by the overall combo than just the AC points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  It shows<br/>
&gt; &gt; the usual lack of any kind of thought when it comes to the bard class.<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t a tank so we get lower armor.  How does this mesh with giving us<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon that reduces our level on the hate list?  If we aren&#39;t a tank why<br/>
&gt; &gt; should we need a weapon to reduce hate?  It certainly won&#39;t help if we<br/>
&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t up there mixing it up.<br/>

&gt; &gt; snip &gt;I think some of us are losing sight of what the bard class<br/>
&gt; &gt; is.  We&#39;re<br/>
