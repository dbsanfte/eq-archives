&gt; My level 35 rogue (as of last night...yaay!) has two SBDs (serrated bone<br/>

It&#39;s only when you get high-frequency-of-occurrance (e.g. your<br/>
weapons proc an average of 10 times or so per fight) that you<br/>
should see the average remaining consistent.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a human tendency to notice and remember unusual<br/>
incidents, such as clumped procs; while the multitude of<br/>
single procs aren&#39;t unusual and thus quickly forgotten.  And<br/>
it&#39;s also possible that Verant coded it so weapon procs are<br/>
dependent on other things.<br/>

effect a 1 point improvement has.  This was definitely the<br/>
case when I checked prices vs. charisma.<br/>
