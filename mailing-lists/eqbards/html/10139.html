<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374979341">I have mentioned this before, but since i just scrolled thru 300 lines<br/>
or quoted text i will mention it again.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE if you are replying to a subject, &lt;snip&gt; the unneeded parts out.<br/>
In general, we do not need to see all 7 replies quoted and quoted again.<br/>
Often you can snip all but the header and a couple of lines. Almost<br/>
always you can snip all of the post except for the one message you are<br/>
replying to.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</div>
