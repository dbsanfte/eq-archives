<div id="ygrps-yiv-271125068">Aye, that&#39;s exactly what I wanted when I started this thread.  I&#39;d much rather<br/>
be a real  Hybrid with additional _defensive_ skills, rather than given bind.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll take either.  The end of the original post says that we get the<br/>
downside of both types.  Fixing either is fine with me :)<br/>

i think he is using a bind argument in order to really say we could use just<br/>
1 more defensive skill, such as parry.  i agree that we should get parry and<br/>
have it capped around the same as our dodge (125?).  it would just put us<br/>
one very small notch towards a melee class, which i do think we are far more<br/>
than a cleric or shaman.  i&#39;ve always thought we should not get bind, and<br/>
all the reasons for and against have already been gone over a million times.<br/>
