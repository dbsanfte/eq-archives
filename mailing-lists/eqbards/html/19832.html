<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094734637">Several months ago, right after the lambent quests got added, I went to NK<br/>
in search of griffennes in order to get a charm.  I was with some guidmates<br/>
and within minutes of entering the zone, we found and killed a griffenne and<br/>
I got a charm.  Months pass and I never bothered with getting a second<br/>
bracer.  So now that the Fabian quest is allegedly fixed, and since I was<br/>
camped in the Arena, I went to NK last night to see if I could get lucky and<br/>
kill two birds with one stone.  I also brought a lower level bard from my<br/>
guild to help him get a charm.  Once again, within minutes of zoning in, we<br/>
found a griffenne, killed it and looted a charm.  I let the lower level bard<br/>
loot it since I could easily solo a griffene if required.  Ran around some<br/>
more and didn&#39;t see any griffennes on track.   So we started killing<br/>
everything in the zone in hopes of getting a griffenne to spawn.  I lost<br/>
count of how many beetles, griffawns, lions, etc that we killed.  Over the<br/>
course of two hours, we were able to kill five griffennes.  Unfortunately,<br/>
none of the other five dropped a charm.  It was getting late so I had to<br/>
camp.   <br/>
<br/>
I guess I got spoiled in that the first two griffenes I killed dropped<br/>
charms.  Not certain how rare the drop is so I guess not looting one on five<br/>
attempts is nothing to get too concerned over.  Its just a nuisiance at this<br/>
point.  IIRC, someone posted a long time ago on the list a method to<br/>
guarantee a griffenne would spawn.  The poster mentioned a /loc to go to<br/>
somewhere in NK.  Does anyone remember the details of this post?  Also, I<br/>
recall someone saying that the only mobs who were placeholders for<br/>
griffennes were griffawns.  Killing the other mobs in NK will not increase<br/>
the chances of getting a griffenne to spawn.  Is that true?<br/>
<br/>
