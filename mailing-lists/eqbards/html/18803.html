&gt; yes it does work the same, but if a bard has to sing the song<br/>
&gt; then they can<br/>
&gt; sing nothing else.  therefore having the spell or an item<br/>
&gt; (fishbone earring,<br/>
&gt; singing steel gloves) is always used over the song.  the song should be<br/>
&gt; memmed for emergencies in underwater zones.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree with this.  Although I get an enduring breath whenever doing<br/>
underwater fighting if this song effect drops you still have your whole<br/>
breath bar to go through before you start drowning so even accounting for a<br/>
normal number of mixed notes you could do your 3 song rotation and mix this<br/>
one in as the third song every second time and you&#39;d be fine.  It worked<br/>
once for me on a corpse recovery, but I do get enduring breath because its a<br/>
little too high stress for me. :)<br/>
