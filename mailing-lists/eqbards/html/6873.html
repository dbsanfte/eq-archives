<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-795210939">Hmm - solo? Forget it.  Well, maybe try South Karana and find blue aviaks.<br/>
Do the bard nuke thing: denon&#39;s, chord&#39;s, hymn, rinse, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Group!<br/>
<br/>
Group on birdies in SK.  <br/>
<br/>
Get a partner and go kill Herman the Hermit (Wait!  what am I saying - u r<br/>
on my server and I am telling u the good spots!  South East corner of SK in<br/>
house inside a wall use AE to pull him.)<br/>
<br/>
Go to HighKeep - basement of the bank.  Start in the Lookout room & Guard<br/>
room until you get a feel for this place.  Soon you will be effective in the<br/>
Warrior room (stronger goblins - higher level players.)  These goblins<br/>
require groups (occasionally a lev 30 shows and wants to solo them) they are<br/>
melee fites for the most part.  Anthem or Chant for the tanks. Binding and<br/>
chains are welcome.  AE songs are ok in there unless someone has trained<br/>
gobs to the guards and them they chase the gobs back down - rare but it<br/>
happens.  Spawn times are far enough apart that you can heal the group<br/>
between although the pallies will no doubt waste mana healing them selves<br/>
after battle - I guess they just enjoy medding.  If the group is co-lev, you<br/>
prolly get a bub every 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly the bard!<br/>

		Does anyone have any suggestions about where to go to earn<br/>
solo experience at my level (24)?<br/>
		Does anyone have any tactical suggestions to permit me to<br/>
keep my butt alive when grouped with mediocre <br/>
		players?</div>
