<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701993967">I meant Karnor might be difficult for a 47 Bard.  At 52 - I can get a pickup<br/>
almost immediately.  On Xegony it&#39;s the easiest zone on the server for me to<br/>
get into a group.  People there realize a Bard can handle CC - much less so<br/>
has been my experience in Sebelis.  And as I mentioned - on Xegony - pickups<br/>
are next to impossible on Chardok due to under use.<br/>

pickups are easy in karnors, i enter do a lfg and get 2-3 tells right away<br/>
80% of the time, if no takers i go outside to ridge, either way this is the<br/>
area that is best for me to get pickup groups early in the morning before<br/>
going to work and getting good xp since im not on for very long.</div>
