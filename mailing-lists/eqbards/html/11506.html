<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378447324"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;d agree if a level 47 person would gain any benefit from a 10 point damage<br/>
&gt; shield.  That was my question, how often does a level 47+ person ever get<br/>
&gt; hit for 10 points or less?  Anyone out there who can answer that?  As it is<br/>
&gt; a 10 pt damage shield would stop pretty much only the 1 pt hits I get.  I<br/>
&gt; seldom get hit for more than 1 and less than 10.  Do hit point shields<br/>
&gt; prevent damage from fire shields and the like?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Effects: Strength: 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; Protective Skin: 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; Healing/Damage: 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; Max HP: 25<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  First off, the Effects in spell data file are not absolute values.<br/>
  They are scalable values.  Or are used in some formula.  Hymm says<br/>
  Healing: 1, Anthem says Strength: 5, for example.  We all know <br/>
  Hymm doesn&#39;t heal one point, nor does Anthem only give 5 strength.<br/>
<br/>
  I will do a little research and repost the info I have found.<br/>
