<div id="ygrps-yiv-624468886">Rokenn&#39;s guild was overcrowded for the New(tm) Hate, so I got<br/>
to fool around a bit with the new songs.<br/>
<br/>
L39 - Found (as far as my friends could tell) only in<br/>
Kelethin.  Upgrade to charm.  Doesn&#39;t require a flute.  Uses<br/>
mana, but during a 5 minute session charming seafuries, I only<br/>
had a sliver of white show up.  I suspect what&#39;s going on is<br/>
that they didn&#39;t want us running around in circles for 15+<br/>
minutes trying over and over to charm mobs that were red to<br/>
us, relying on the occasional success to help us kill 2 red<br/>
mobs.  When I tried the song on myself (with 61 MR I resist<br/>
about half the time), I did notice an appreciable amount of<br/>
mana loss - maybe a quarter bubble - in about 1 minute.  <br/>
(Btw, seafuries make terrible charming targets - they do<br/>
relatively little damage compared to their hp, and take a<br/>
really long time to kill each other.)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t test for level limit.  If we can charm level 50<br/>
stuff, then I need to go try charming Brother Zephyl - he can<br/>
kill a hill giant in 11 seconds.  :)  Course he resisted all<br/>
my Chains previously so who knows...<br/>
<br/>
This is a very welcome and long overdue upgrade.  I will not<br/>
be avoiding the dead side of LGuk and the bug/bats in Sol B<br/>
anymore.  And I guess I&#39;ll have to stop passing on all the<br/>
Orbs of Tishan that drop off Nagafen.  :)<br/>
<br/>
L45 - str/atk buff, attack speedup, and magical skin (a la<br/>
Rune).  It&#39;s targeted, but seems to work on both party members<br/>
and non-party members.  It does seem to be a &quot;twinking&quot; song,<br/>
but OTOH I can see it being useful in emergencies when your<br/>
healer is OOM and someone is about to die.  Previously, all we<br/>
could do was charm the mob, which only pauses things.  Now we<br/>
can put a small Rune on someone.  I haven&#39;t tested how many hp<br/>
the rune is yet.  It does *not* work on charmed pets - you get<br/>
a &quot;you cannot cast this spell on this NPC&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
The big problem with this song is that it seems they forgot<br/>
our brass skill caps at 200.  You get a ton of missed notes<br/>
with it even at max skill.  Whatever they did to fix the<br/>
missed notes with L41+ songs, they forgot to do with this<br/>
song.  /bug it and hope they fix it (servers went down this<br/>
morning for a patch so maybe they&#39;ve already fixed it).<br/>
<br/>
Another problem with it (if you use it for twinking) is that<br/>
low level mobs tend to run at half hp if you use this on<br/>
someone.  They interpret this buff as you aggroing on them,<br/>
and since you&#39;re so high level, they run at half.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, very welcome additions.  I&#39;m on the verge of<br/>
thinking the bard is overpowered again.<br/>
