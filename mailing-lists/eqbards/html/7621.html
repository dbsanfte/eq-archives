<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265074949">I role play a lot with my bard, part of his roleplaying, well a large part<br/>
in fact involves giving free concerts for the masses.<br/>
<br/>
I like to use the emote system to enhance my songs I sing, specifically I<br/>
always do:<br/>
<br/>
:sings, Hello dwarfie, how are you?<br/>
<br/>
which appears as, Orchestro sings, Hello dwarfie, how are you?<br/>
<br/>
I feel this enhances the effect of singing.  Maybe verant would consider<br/>
adding another check box to the speech box (group/say/tell check boxes etc.)<br/>
of sing.  so that if you typed:<br/>
<br/>
Bash and Bond and Bellow and Shout!<br/>
<br/>
It would appear as:<br/>
<br/>
Orchestro sings, Bash and Bond and Bellow and Shout!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just a /sing toggle.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesnt encite as big a response, as I dont think this would<br/>
affect Verants grand plans, or involve the definition of a hybrid class :=)<br/>
lol..</div>
