&gt;Spud, you have quite clearly outlined all the reasons I am NOT renewing my<br/>
&gt;EQ subscription.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Indeed - had I known that what little else there was to do would be<br/>
&gt;destroyed so soon - I&#39;d have never wasted my money in the first place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As a class, I too love my bard - but I hold Verant responsible for false<br/>
&gt;advertising. EQ is NOT a virtual world, it&#39;s a very pretty Quake - at least<br/>
&gt;now.<br/>

Anywho I do know how you feel, but coming from UO I was prepared.  I run an<br/>
online DnD game and am a PC in another so I guess I get my roleplaying from<br/>
those.  I play EQ for what it is, a major hack and slash game.  I don&#39;t play<br/>
it nearly as much as I did, and because I just can&#39;t keep up with my friends<br/>
I may end up quitting sooner or later just because I wind up soloing all the<br/>
time.<br/>
