<div id="ygrps-yiv-47105071"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; EQ has definately fallen into the trap of raising the bar - once you start<br/>
&gt; this, you start catering to the powergamers and cutting out newbies and<br/>
&gt; your whole non-powergaming audience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wanna add new tougher areas - fine....but unless something is SOOO broken<br/>
&gt; there is no other way - don&#39;t go &#39;fixin&#39; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t go making what used to be newbie areas 40plus areas - especially ones<br/>
&gt; that newbies pretty much HAVE to go thru. Don&#39;t go making changes based on<br/>
&gt; server demographics on older servers just cause X% is above X level now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This is something neither you nor I can control.  It is inevitable<br/>
  that the server population will on average be higher level than it<br/>
  was the day before.  Verant changing zones that used to at one time<br/>
  be safe, and now are dangerous for even L50 people is risky I will<br/>
  admit.  But all you people who complain about Kithicor, need only<br/>
  have to wait until 7am in the morning when all the undead go away<br/>
  to make a crossing.  It&#39;s a matter of patience.  Could they have <br/>
  picked a different zone to screw with?  Sure.  But the average number<br/>
  of players in Kith at any given time was like 4, now it&#39;s always <br/>
  populated with at least 10 - 15 people.  And so will Paw become.<br/>
<br/>
  Players who are newbies don&#39;t have the items to make witty attacks<br/>
  on mobs.  I am talking about the upper level people advancing on a<br/>
  high level mob.  Feign Death is part of that example where they<br/>
  could have modified the monster&#39;s intelligence and not the player&#39;s<br/>
  ability.  That point got washed away in your response. I&#39;m<br/>
  level 40+ now, does that make me a powergamer?  Innoruuk server is<br/>
  pumping out L50s like there is no tomorrow.  90 people in lguk,<br/>
  70 people in solb, I mean jeez....  Last time I was in North Qeynos<br/>
  the snakes took over.  I saw a few L5 people and that was it.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant will raise the bar, that cannot be stopped.  They have to.<br/>
  There is a much more mature player base now.  However, I would <br/>
  like them to evaluate the impact more than they have in the past.<br/>
  Kithicor Woods was probably a dumb move.  Infected Splitpaw will<br/>
  be an excellent move.  You know, I love Everfrost.  It&#39;s one zone,<br/>
  divided into like three level areas of difficulty.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
  mind seeing zones get virtually divided this way more often.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s ODD I cannot &#39;get over&#39; the USE of &#39;ticks&#39; and CAPITALIZATION.<br/>
  Emphasizing is a great way to make certain points hit home, overdoing<br/>
  it makes me, for one, feel like you are YELLING and FRUSTRATED.  It&#39;s<br/>
  like it&#39;s my fault Verant is upgrading, so you take it out on me.<br/>
  &lt;sniff&gt;  Hell, you didn&#39;t even sign your name, hehe.<br/>
