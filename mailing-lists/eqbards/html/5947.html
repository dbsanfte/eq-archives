<b>Subject:</b> Re: SoW vs. Accelerando conflict <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-20234161">At least I&#39;m not crazy. So that is a new change, and it&#39;s in the game proper <br/>
(I wasn&#39;t playing on the test server).<br/>
<br/>
If they left the change as it is now, but add the ability for the target of <br/>
SoW to manually cancel it (self-only) by left-clicking the icon (the way <br/>
casters can cancel buffs they cast on themselves), it would solve the <br/>
problem in short order, I think. Would still keep grouped bards from ruining <br/>
everything if they panic and hit Accelerando (because SoW would still <br/>
override), but would also allow bards who are flying solo, escorting a small <br/>
group of newbies or have just left a group [or just got buffed by a <br/>
less-than-astute, but well-meaning shaman or druid] to use Accelerando to <br/>
their benefit.<br/>
<br/>
As a wise man once said, oh well.<br/>

&gt;&lt;snip story about SoW overriding Accelerando&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If it&#39;s been like this for a while, sorry. It&#39;s just that I seem to <br/>
&gt;remember<br/>
&gt; &gt;that Accelerando used to override SoW, not the other way around (you <br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt;still have the SoW icon, but you&#39;d run at Accelerando speed and get the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Your feet move faster&quot; message).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I hate to say it, and I know there&#39;s gonna be a bunch more deaths as<br/>
&gt;a result of this, but I&#39;m glad they implemented this change.  Sure, it<br/>
&gt;nerfs our ability to help our teammates - but these are the same teammates<br/>
&gt;who were upset that we were overriding their SoW before during emergency<br/>
&gt;peelouts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, I&#39;m not really happy about it - but I have a feeling it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;nerf-to-stay.<br/>
