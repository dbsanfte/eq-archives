I was in a group with a level 18 Shadowknight, Zxyyr, and a level 17 cleric,<br/>
Acme.<br/>
The three of us BROKE the three-spawn in Lake Rathe (with the help of a<br/>
clarity<br/>
cast on all three of us by a passing high level enchanter) Zxyyr would fear<br/>
one<br/>
of the aviaks, I would assist her and played Lullaby ALL the time until we<br/>
were<br/>
down to just one aviak we were fighting. Acme healed and medded. We broke<br/>
the<br/>
spawn. And then held the spot for the next four hours, killing one at a<br/>
time. The<br/>
cleric was EXCELLENT at mana management, rarely ending a fight at less than<br/>
60 mana,<br/>
so we were always ready for the almost constant spawn. After we broke it, it<br/>
was not<br/>
really a dangerous place to camp, either. Although most of the birds were<br/>
red<br/>
to me. But there was an elation to being able to break it ourselves, and<br/>
hold it!<br/>
