<div id="ygrps-yiv-244567388">Okay<br/>
<br/>
I did some testing tonight with the Libretto.<br/>
<br/>
1. You must be grouped.<br/>
2. You must target the player wishing for something identified.<br/>
3. They MUST be holding the object (i.e. on their cursor)<br/>
4. You will get a message: You must select a target for this song.<br/>
5. They will get a message identical to the one you would have received if<br/>
you had been targeted and holding the item yourself.<br/>
6. You MUST target yourself to get an identify on your own objects.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably some other anomalies that I couldn&#39;t figure out.<br/>
