<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282864407">A week ago I had a guy auctioning a stone.  I offered 30.  He said I was<br/>
insane - that they were &quot;worth 100&quot;.  I try to explain simple economics -<br/>
that item is worth what people are willing to pay for it.  I was willing to<br/>
pay no more than 100pp.  He launched into a diatribe about how difficult it<br/>
would be for me to kill a Hill Giant at my level (I was 25 at the time - he<br/>
was 35).<br/>
<br/>
I said fine - and if someone else would pay 100 - then good for them.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know whether he found a bard who paid the 100 or not.  I expect he<br/>
did.  Probably the kind of bard I got into an argument with last night.  He<br/>
never twisted songs.  And only played Jig of Vigor - never Hymn between<br/>
battles.  He insisted it increased mana recovery by 10-15 percent.  When I<br/>
told it didn&#39;t he laughed and said &quot;That old rumor&quot;.  He insisted that he<br/>
tested it and it did work...<br/>
Interestingly enough - one of my guildmates - a 28 cleric insisted that it<br/>
did speed his mana recovery.  This guy lives in bumblef***  Wisconsin and<br/>
goes linkdead on average once every 30-45 minutes.  PL was bad for me last<br/>
night for me (I have DSL and usually get really good connectivity) - and<br/>
given the quality of his connection - I would assume he gets REALLY bad PL.<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Jig does help with refresh in these cases...<br/>

PS by bumblef* Wisconsin I don&#39;t mean to denigrate Wisconsin as a whole -<br/>
but do have to point out that the Packers lost to the Bears yesterday (:<br/>

&gt; I got a Lambent Stone yesterday for 30PP.  His original auction was for<br/>
&gt; 100PP.  All you have to do is put them in thier place. =)  It also helps<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re the only Bard in the zone.  I may take your suggestions and head to<br/>
&gt; Perma and Guk and see if I can get some looting rights =).<br/>

&gt; &gt;I got lambert greves at 23.  Use your invise song and hit guk and perma<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;get shin and icy greves respectively  if you spend some time  ~ 2 hour in<br/>
&gt; &gt;both dungons for me you can reqest looting rights for the armor. As it is<br/>
&gt; &gt;lore and heavy it is bad loot to most of the casters hunting there and<br/>
thay<br/>
&gt; &gt;willing let you loot and watch your back. Good luck to you you will need<br/>
&gt; 110<br/>
&gt; &gt;pp to by gems to do quest.  Maybe another 100 pp if you buy your lambert.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lambert stones are acutiong around 100 pp ( i will not pay that im to<br/>
&gt; &gt;cheep )<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;    Call me indecisive - but money accumulates in my bank - cause I can<br/>
&gt; &gt;never decide what to spend it on.  I have in the neighborhood of 850pp.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;not too thrilled with my armor.  Mostly some banded still a lot of<br/>
barbed,<br/>
&gt; &gt;etc.  A few pieces of bronze.  I&#39;m at level 26 btw - so I&#39;m almost at the<br/>
&gt; &gt;point where I can think about questing for Lambent.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;    But anyway - I got to the armor store in E Freeport and look at the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Steel Plate.  I notice that they mostly offer 1 or 2 AC points above the<br/>
&gt; &gt;equivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.  Question<br/>
&gt; &gt;is - is it worth it?  How important is one or two AC points?  How<br/>
important<br/>
&gt; &gt;is 2 or 3 but giving up STR or whatever bonuses.  I have Blackened Iron<br/>
&gt; &gt;Shoulders.  It says &quot;Magic Item&quot;.  What does this actually provide?  Is<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Steel Pauldron the equivalent?  Pretty annoying you can&#39;t tell without<br/>
&gt; &gt;buying and then you can sell it at a fraction of what you pay for it if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;make a mistake (obviously forcing you to check website like EQualizer...<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;    Anyone have any other suggestions on what to spend money on?  For<br/>
&gt; weaps<br/>
