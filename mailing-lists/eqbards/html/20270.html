<div id="ygrps-yiv-638016063">handy on plane of sky trips. Other then that, not very imo. i guess i can<br/>
understand where a mage would want one for their air pets. Then again, my<br/>
main is a necro, if im in an open area, i always have Dead man floating on<br/>
which lasts over an hour of see invis effect.  But damn, to pay 2k for a see<br/>
invis item is nuts. Congrats 8)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] bracer of the hidden<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Won a lotto item from inside the Sarnak castle on the<br/>
Lake...<br/>
<br/>
Bracer of the Hidden, AC 6, all, all<br/>
effect: see invisible<br/>
<br/>
Rare drop off sarnak legos.<br/>
<br/>
I was drowned in tells starting at 500 pp.<br/>
I sold it for 2K to a 54th lvl magician for the<br/>
&quot;convenience&quot; of being able to see his air pet.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I had no idea anyone would pay that much for<br/>
it...I would have been overjoyed with 200.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:  Am I really goig to need this<br/>
THAT much at higher lvl?<br/>
