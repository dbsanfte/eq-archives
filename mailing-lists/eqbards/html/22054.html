<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Question about crafted weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528224350">Yea, regular mithril sheets for imbued too, just + gem. I&#39;ve got a 175<br/>
and succeed about 80% on morningstars and about 50% on rapiers. I&#39;ve<br/>
tried daggers and you would think in 4 attempts at least one success..<br/>
Note: I have done maybe 20 attempts and had 0 increases but my int is<br/>
only 85 and my str 124 with Chant.<br/>
<br/>
Er, rapiers? They&#39;re bad mammajammas but I cruised all over the old<br/>
world, hitting the low-mid level zones, and nobody wanted one. I was<br/>
trying to sell them for 200. That is not a bad price since they average<br/>
at 10 damage per minute below an EBW mid 30 but have +stats and 200<br/>
1/15 the cost. I eventually gave one away for 55p + a screaming mace<br/>
because I wanted to clear out inventory (the mace will sell quickly).<br/>
In general tho I&#39;ll sell everything for 200, was selling morningstars<br/>
for 300 and they went but I felt dirty.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be up for taking custom orders if it weren&#39;t such a pain getting<br/>
imbued emeralds/plains pebbles and morning dew. That and hanging out in<br/>
GFay really puts a dent in my ever-slow leveling. I need to get some<br/>
more emeralds/dew for some backordered morningstars but if 200p in<br/>
cash/goods/services sounds ok then have your friend shoot me a tell. If<br/>
it&#39;s not I&#39;m sure something can be arranged.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Jeers and Beers,<br/>

&gt;  Is<br/>
&gt; this true even for the Imbued Weapons?  What skill does one need to<br/>
&gt; have a<br/>
&gt; reasonable success rate on them?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a ranger friend on E&#39;ci who&#39;d love to have a Tunare Rapier,<br/>
&gt; what are<br/>
&gt; you selling them for?<br/>
