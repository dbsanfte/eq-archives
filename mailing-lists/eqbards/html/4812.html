&gt;In truth many people do I would think.  Only recently I gave up the<br/>
&gt;dragoon dirk/combine rapier combo for a dirk/polished granite tomahawk.<br/>
&gt;As vain as I may sound I prefer the dirk/rapier look.  I just need the<br/>
&gt;tomahawk since I usually end up being the tank in my party.  Having seen<br/>
&gt;a staff of writhing I absolutely refuse to wield one.  What would the<br/>
&gt;ladies think of you while using one? &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

for almost 20 levels off and on (mainly to get blunt skill up, never really <br/>
as a main weapon) i sold it off, much to her delight. I called it the Ugly <br/>
Stick, cuz - well it IS ugly IMHO.<br/>
