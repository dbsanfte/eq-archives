<b>Subject:</b> Replying to bind and grouping issues <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874326274">Hi all,<br/>
Been reading the digest.. couldent resist the bind issue.. I tried belive me!<br/>
I personally dont feel ANY need for bind and I think that it would make the game<br/>
unbalanced &quot;hybrids&quot; and bards where allowed to bind everywhere.<br/>
The reason why I think it would be unbalancing is that it would allow the groups<br/>
to get back into the dungeon much faster (before respawns). Besides I dont think<br/>
that if bind would give you more than 30-50mins of extra play pr level (how much<br/>
in % do that add up to?) you die to often and might want to rethink your<br/>
strategi. Sure bards CAN die alot more than other classes, but if youre in the<br/>
right groups you WONT. I cut drastically on my death rate when I decided that<br/>
the only times I would take risks is when a competent healer is around<br/>
(druid/shaman will do). If you like me play in pickup groups, keep an eye on<br/>
them at first and keep Selo/fear memmed until you can trust em with your life.<br/>
As I have  gotten more and more critical with the groups I stay in I have downed<br/>
my death rate in groups to 2-3 times per level. Most deaths now a days is when I<br/>
solo and get over confident :o).<br/>
I dont think that the bard lack any skills etc. at my current level (28th<br/>
birthdate 2nd of April 1999, played 28days something).<br/>
The key note to staying alive as a bard IMO is good groups! Let me hear you all<br/>
/shout we want good groups!!<br/>
