<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741431043"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; PS. Can anyone tell me what level Greater Ice bones are, I was in the<br/>
&gt; bedroom in L Guk with my group and we had cleared the area. I went round<br/>
&gt; the corner towards the Assasin room and there were 3 Gtr Ice bones, all<br/>
&gt; conned red to me at level 30 so I didn&#39;t risk pulling them. My group was<br/>
&gt; made up of 29 Druid, 30 Bard (me), 30 Paladin and 34 Mage (with fire pet).<br/>
&gt; Would we of been able to take them?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The short answer to your question is that your group made up of 29 Druid, 30<br/>
Bard, 30 Paladin and 34 Mage (with fire pet) would have died pulling those<br/>
GIBS.  You made the right choice to leave them be.  They&#39;re probably about<br/>
level 34-36 as they were blue to me at 37th.  They&#39;re nasty for their level<br/>
though: casting tanks slinging cold based spells.  When you pull one you get<br/>
them all, so you would have been fighting five spell casting tanks with your<br/>
group.  It woulda been ugly.<br/>
------<br/>
FYI:<br/>
Threading your way from the zone to the more difficult parts of lower guk is<br/>
tricky.  For those that don&#39;t know lower guk, you zone in and there&#39;s some<br/>
undead frogs (and some live ones) near the dead side zone, but if you want<br/>
to go to any of the places in lower guk with named mobs you have to get an<br/>
invis vs undead and swim down a little stream, under a stone overhang, and<br/>
pop up into the &quot;Bedroom&quot; (or BR, so-called because there&#39;s a bed in it).<br/>
There&#39;s about three spawn locations in the bedroom, and undead ghoul wizards<br/>
are fequently here.  Taking the room can be kinda tricky for people of the<br/>
appropriate level to fight there, but for folks in their lower 30s it&#39;s<br/>
about the best place to be *except* for the fact that any time you hear<br/>
&quot;DEAD TRAIN!&quot; or &quot;GIBS TRAIN&quot;, it&#39;s coming right through there unless the<br/>
conductor dies.  No ifs, ands, buts or saving rolls.<br/>
<br/>
There are two paths leading out of the BR and they both very shortly empty<br/>
into the same room.  This room, the &quot;bat room&quot;, has a passage leading off to<br/>
the left and to the right.  Most people are heading left as that takes you<br/>
over toward the assassin, etc. and most of lower guk.  The bat room room has<br/>
a couple of frog spawns and some sonic bats.  Here&#39;s the tricky part.  The<br/>
invis vs undead that you got at the zone doesn&#39;t help you with the bats,<br/>
only the frogs, however, if you hug the wall going left pretty tightly then<br/>
the bats won&#39;t agro on you.<br/>
<br/>
So now you&#39;re in a hallway leading further into the dead side of lower guk<br/>
and you&#39;ve made it past some undead frogs and the live bats and you&#39;re<br/>
feeling pretty good.  Ahead of you you see 5 great big Greater Ice Bones in<br/>
a little alcove to your left.  What you don&#39;t know the first time or two<br/>
that you go there is that your invis vs undead doesn&#39;t work against them.<br/>
Most folks just jog down the hall and die horrible screaming deaths their<br/>
first time and think that their invis dropped.  To get by the GIBS you have<br/>
to hug the right wall like your life depends on it, &#39;cause it does.  If<br/>
you&#39;re not rubbing the righthand wall opposite the GIBS when you pass by<br/>
here there is an extremely good chance that they will agro on you.  Those<br/>
suckers killed me about three times in earlier levels because I wasn&#39;t<br/>
*quite* rubbing the wall.  Once I accidentally got my finger across two keys<br/>
on the keyboard and was dead about 15 seconds later.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, once you&#39;re past those GIBS your worst fear is that your<br/>
invis vs undead will drop - and it will at the worst possible times.<br/>
Sometimes it seems like the chances of invis vs undead failing is directly<br/>
proportional to how badly you need it.  Get invis vs undead and sit at the<br/>
zone and it&#39;ll last 20 minutes.  Get invis vs undead and head way off to the<br/>
Executioner&#39;s Room or something and it&#39;ll fail when you pop up into the<br/>
bedroom.</div>
