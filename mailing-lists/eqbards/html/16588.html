Just to clarify what it means to &quot;buff without<br/>
exceeding your mana regen rate...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Say each buff costs you one bubble. Say each buff<br/>
lasts 60 minutes. Say you meditate back one bubble a<br/>
minute. That means you can keep a maximum of 60 buffs<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
How many buffs you can cast going from FM to OOM is<br/>
pretty irrelevant since buffing is almost always done<br/>
during downtime. What matters is how many buffs your<br/>
mana regeneration rate allows you to maintain.<br/>
<br/>
This is the type of analysis Verant failed to do (and<br/>
is failing to do) every time they go off on one of<br/>
their &quot;but bards use no mana!&quot; tangents. No we don&#39;t<br/>
use mana, but because of the short lifespan of our<br/>
songs and the (relatively) long &quot;casting time&quot; for our<br/>
songs, it&#39;s pretty much the same thing as using mana.<br/>
In fact, you can think of our songs as spells that<br/>
last 12 seconds, require 5 bubbles of mana to cast,<br/>
and our mana regen rate gives us back 5 bubbles every<br/>
3 seconds.<br/>
