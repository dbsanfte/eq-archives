<div id="ygrps-yiv-769250396"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;FYI:  I&#39;ve known him, in game, since Beta 2.  He&#39;s a <br/>
&gt;nice guy, fun to hunt with and very knowledgeable <br/>
&gt;about his OWN class.  Just like we are.  You can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;blame him for not knowing bards.  He&#39;s a mouthpiece, <br/>
&gt;nothing more.  He had an idea, offered it up and was <br/>
&gt;wrong and admitted it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I mostly lurk here but I really feel that I do have to<br/>
comment here.  Remember Gordon is the guy who felt<br/>
that putting points into strength for his necro was a<br/>
valid character creation strategy...that IMO proves<br/>
his lack of understanding of how EQ works awfully<br/>
well.  My Bard is at a whopping level 8 yet because I<br/>
have 3 characters over level 30 I was able to see that<br/>
twisting invis wouldn&#39;t work.  I don&#39;t blame him for<br/>
not knowing Bards...I blame him for not knowing EQ as<br/>
a whole.<br/>
