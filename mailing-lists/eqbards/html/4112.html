<div id="ygrps-yiv-935782311">Why would this aggravate you? In my experience, the majority of twinks are<br/>
people starting over with new characters because they were unhappy with<br/>
their original class. Why put yourself through the frustration of the early<br/>
levels all over again, when you have ALREADY worked your ass off attaining a<br/>
good fortune, along with decent items. There certainly isn&#39;t any<br/>
role-playing reason that would stop this (e.g. my older &quot;Brother&quot; retired<br/>
from adventuring and passed along some gear and money to help with my<br/>
training)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to say you should twink, obviously play the game the way you<br/>
want, just saying you shouldn&#39;t let twinks aggravate you, as the majority of<br/>
them DID work hard to get their gear, and just dont want to TOTALLY WASTE<br/>
all the time already put into a game this massive.<br/>

&gt;I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players<br/>
&gt;because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our<br/>
&gt;behinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out<br/>
&gt;in part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford<br/>
&gt;buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that<br/>
&gt;until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces<br/>
&gt;(or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate<br/>
&gt;would I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I<br/>
&gt;play. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them -<br/>
&gt;sure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;not a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making the<br/>
&gt;most out of EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Twinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>
&gt;&gt;immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>
&gt;&gt;sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>
&gt;&gt;whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>
&gt;&gt;for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>
&gt;&gt;to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>
&gt;&gt;by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>
&gt;&gt;be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13.<br/>
