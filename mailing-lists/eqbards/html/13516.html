<div id="ygrps-yiv-911242629">The same item dropped on Tarew Marr last night. Lemme confirm a few things with ya if you would. It drops<br/>
on the third (gorgon) island off a harpie type thing. Or if not a harpie a Gorgalask since they look the<br/>
same. FoH reported a Pal-only belt with the same sort of stats so I&#39;m assuming they drop for all melee<br/>
classes randomly on a specific mob perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
Shada, each class gets 6 quest items, and supposedly there&#39;s tons of other stuff that drops as normal<br/>
loot. On Tarew Marr we obtained only 2 &quot;dropped&quot; items which includes the bard haste belt last night<br/>
however, so we&#39;ll see.<br/>
