<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321519434">I&#39;m pretty sure that undead spells work on wisps.  I&#39;m not sure, but <br/>
my guild leader (cleric) told me that she was able to cast undead <br/>
dd&#39;s on them back in the days of Befallen ;)  Maybe that is why they <br/>
dislike clerics so much?  :)  Try casting undead dd&#39;s on them, see if <br/>
it works.<br/>

&gt; Strangely enough, I&#39;ve spent only one full day in Hate. I was the <br/>
only bard<br/>
&gt; all day as I recall. I got the boots, BP and a Martune rapier. I&#39;ve <br/>
only<br/>
&gt; been back once for just a few hours, it was mostly clean and we <br/>
just went to<br/>
&gt; lend a hand to the crew finishing up after some folks had to camp. <br/>
No bard<br/>
&gt; stuff dropped either time from the Maestro.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh btw, I&#39;ve found wisps really really hate clerics. I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
the like<br/>
&gt; since they turned down bard hate. Twice last night in WC my L10 <br/>
cleric was<br/>
&gt; ganged by wisps. I started on one, another dove in when the first <br/>
was mostly<br/>
&gt; dead, then it was about dead a third and then a fourth jumped in! I <br/>
only saw<br/>
&gt; the one wisp when I started the fight. I had to run. Later, I <br/>
started on<br/>
&gt; another one and in about 2 minutes, I had five live wisps chase me <br/>
to the<br/>
&gt; zoneline after I killed the first one! Have you ever seen a wisp <br/>
train? I<br/>
&gt; had zoned in and out between fights so there couldn&#39;t have been any <br/>
leftover<br/>
&gt; aggro.<br/>
