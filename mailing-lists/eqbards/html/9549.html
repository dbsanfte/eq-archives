<div id="ygrps-yiv-563035165">Actually, going from WC to RV or HH - on the path take all right forks -<br/>
until the last one which is more like a T - there go right to Rivervale and<br/>
left to HighHold.  Going the other way?  Got to the T then all left forks.<br/>
This is of course when it is a &quot;normal&quot; zone.  When they have the invasion<br/>
event going - not even the wall hugging will save you.<br/>

p.s. I was taking some &quot;clueless newbie&quot; through to qeynos one time and he<br/>
complained that it was too dark.  this was before I had my infa vis song so<br/>
I didn&#39;t have a solution for him.  well, he amazed me by going into one of<br/>
the shops by the wc zone and buying a lantern (or torch) - hehe guess I was<br/>
the clue-less one!<br/>

		&gt; make me feel any better. I kicked up Selo&#39;s said a silent<br/>
prayer to Karana<br/>

<br/>
		Word of advice - stick to the (right) wall.  On the zone<br/>
from WC - hug the<br/>
		wall - and keep doing so.  Be careful not to take falling<br/>
damage -<br/>
		especially around the RV zone.  Get off the wall and run<br/>
around it.  Get<br/>
		back on the wall and hug it.  You&#39;ll see &quot;stone&quot; again.  Get<br/>
down - you&#39;ll<br/>
		catch up with the trail and you can follow it a very short<br/>
way to the HP<br/>
		zone.<br/>
<br/>
		It&#39;s safer - and easier to keep your party from getting<br/>
separated in the<br/>
		dark and fog...<br/>
