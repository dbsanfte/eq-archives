<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049808970">I never had any problems with returning form the arena and it is a lot <br/>
     closer. (by a factor of 5 or 6, west Karana is BIG)  You need to  <br/>
     climb the west wall around the undead area near the zone border and <br/>
     have accelardo going since you occasionally get attacked there but I <br/>
     always made it to zone NP.  (scout the route ahead of time so you know <br/>
     the way) In  S. Karana you are so close to the village and most the of <br/>
     mobs are non-aggro that getting your body is very easy.  The only real <br/>
     danger is running into a named frogie in the water of rath lake.  It <br/>
     is a very rare event (never happened to me) but I suggest having your <br/>
     swimming trained up and play acccelardo while you swim just in case.  <br/>
     It takes over 20 minutes to run to the aviak village from Qeynos (even <br/>
     with a drum) where the arena is only about 2 minutes away.  No <br/>
     question in my mind, get bound in the arena.<br/>
     <br/>
     another hint, you can sell you stuff at the centaur village in the NE <br/>
     corner of S. Karana.  Saves that long run back to Qeynos to sell.  Now <br/>
     if the centaurs only had a bank...  )<br/>

For bards who hunt in South Karana, is it best to get bound in the Arena or <br/>
in Qeynos?  The Arena may be quicker in terms of getting back to your corpse <br/>
but you won&#39;t have a flute to sing invis song (to avoid getting attacked as <br/>
you run back to your corpse).  Is this something I should be concerned with <br/>
or will the wandering mobs in SK leave me alone?<br/>

&gt; Since on my server (Karana) the Treehouse is majorly camped, but there are <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; many wandering Avaiks in the area between the Treehouse and Paw.  When I <br/>
&gt; used to slow there I would just zoom around with Selo&#39;s till I found one. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was still quicker (and more fun) then fighting over the static spawn <br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; the Treehouse :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Myself and another bard on my server, seem to be doing well in South <br/>
&gt; Karana<br/>
&gt; &gt;fighting Aviaks in and around the Aviak City... We can solo Darters and <br/>
&gt; &gt;Rooks, and in groups we can take harriers and Avocets, these things are <br/>
&gt; &gt;rich<br/>
&gt; &gt;also.  I went from just hitting 21 to well into 23 so far in a couple of <br/>
&gt; &gt;days.<br/>
