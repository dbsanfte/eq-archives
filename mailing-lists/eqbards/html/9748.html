<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-56859764">Definitely.  I offered one person auctioning one in S Ro 30pp and he<br/>
laughed.  I laughed in return and said good luck in getting more.  He said<br/>
his guildmates paid him 100pp apiece for the last two.  I told him they were<br/>
crazy and that I had even seen them at merchants for 47pp.  He said good<br/>
luck getting one then and camped.  The very next nite I was given one by a<br/>
38th level warrior who I healed up during the GM even in Greater Faydark.<br/>
The 39th level wizard he was grouped with offered me a dirk, but since I<br/>
already had one I declined.  I have found our healing ability, being<br/>
non-mana based, extremely useful for helping higher levels recover during<br/>
and after GM quest events.  <br/>

I&#39;ve been doing the same on E&#39;ci...I bought one for 20 plat and have<br/>
seen them auctioned for 100+.  When they laugh at my offers of 20<br/>
plat, I just tell them that if they can sell it for more to someone<br/>
else, go right ahead...I don&#39;t know who told them that they could sell<br/>
it for that much though...<br/>
