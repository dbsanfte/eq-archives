<div id="ygrps-yiv-860890209">Here is a bit of advise from a relatively low level<br/>
bard (lvl 22):<br/>
<br/>
I use Denon&#39;s Discord and Chords of Dissonance  a lot!<br/>
 I twist them quite often.  I know that the area<br/>
effect is an issue, but in places like Mistmoore it<br/>
isn&#39;t really a problem.  Most of the time you get an<br/>
initiate or pledge another comes with it.  So you are<br/>
fighting more than one at a time, so why not do damage<br/>
to all of them at the same time.  It also helps out<br/>
parties around me.  <br/>
<br/>
When I lure, I use Bellow and then ofcourse Selo to<br/>
get the creature to my party.  Once I get it back to<br/>
the party, I turn on Denon&#39;s and after the first pulse<br/>
I go for Chords and then 2 Bellows or a Bellow and<br/>
Anthem.  This gives me almost 4 songs going at the<br/>
same time, with damage and buff.  All the while I am<br/>
doing this, I am also meleeing.  I know this sounds<br/>
complicated, but the amount of damage I can do is<br/>
staggering.  Of course having a well balanced party<br/>
helps the eventual finishing off, but the 2 area<br/>
effect damage songs are quite good.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know any of the exact numbers as to how much<br/>
damage the 2 songs do, but I can see the health bar of<br/>
the creature actually move every time it pulses.<br/>
