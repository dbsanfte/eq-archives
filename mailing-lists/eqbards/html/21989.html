<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144352107">I know a few people who include emotes in their assist keys.  Heres the<br/>
problem, if the assist fails (IE talk isn&#39;t hitting anything) they usally<br/>
end up emoting ME since if there target was blank, it has probably switched<br/>
to me when my song pulsed.<br/>
<br/>
So I get all these horrible emotes done to me :(</div>
