<div id="ygrps-yiv-615174536">Not true from what I&#39;ve seen.  With no spellcasting they are as good a tank<br/>
as a bard if not better.  Add even 18 seconds of invulnerability to that and<br/>
they definitely outlast us.  The cycle time is long, about 5 minutes, but<br/>
being invulnerable for 18 seconds out of a 90-120 second fight effectively<br/>
increases their hit points by 10-15%.  Since they have as many hits if not<br/>
more than us already, and the same armor plus a shield...  It adds up<br/>
quickly to their being able to absorb way more damage than us.  I have duo&#39;d<br/>
with my dwarf cleric friend several times and when he gets a mob&#39;s focus he<br/>
always ends up taking far less damage than I do, especially in the shorter<br/>
fights.  Imagine the following, 4 wizards, 1 cleric.  Cleric casts smite,<br/>
then divine aura and gives the wizards 18 seconds of nuking.  In same<br/>
situation the bard would take a hell of a lot of damage trying to solo tank<br/>
the same critter the cleric could.<br/>

&gt; Clerics dodge skill caps at 80 so they are better tanks than us probably.<br/>

I think ours caps at 100.  Can someone around L18-21 check? <br/>
Still, that&#39;s a far cry from the 200 the other melee classes<br/>
get.  I really do think that this is a very important<br/>
oversight - all the other classes with poor defensive skills<br/>
can do considerable damage at a distance using<br/>
root/SoW/snare/pets to keep the mob away from them.  But<br/>
because we&#39;re a melee hybrid, our primary means of damage<br/>
requires that we be in melee range.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Especially when you consider their ability to cast Divine Aura and be<br/>
&gt; invincible for a brief time.  Sadly enough in my normal group our tanks<br/>
are<br/>
<br/>
Well, they can&#39;t cast spells while invulnerable, and it&#39;s<br/>
supposed to have a really long cycle time.  It&#39;s basically a<br/>
last-ditch get-out-of-death-free tactic, to help them run for<br/>
the zone.  Once a cleric casts Divine Aura, he is no longer a<br/>
factor in the fight (other than your party trying to keep him<br/>
alive).<br/>
