have it so far down on the priority list then.  what is the higher priority, something<br/>
people have already learned to work around or something which can wipe out<br/>
hundreds of hours of playtime on a character?<br/>
<br/>
you know well over 100 players, eh?  out of the 200000 subscribers.  yeah, that&#39;s<br/>
an appropriate sample size to determine that poofed corpses are just not a problem.</div>
