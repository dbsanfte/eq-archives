For those that don&#39;t follow the sport, your +/- rating in<br/>
hockey is the number of goals your team scored while you were<br/>
on the ice, minus the number of goals the other team scored<br/>
while you were on the ice.<br/>
<br/>
So you could inspect a player and see the number of<br/>
experience-giving monsters killed while grouped, divided by<br/>
number of group members who&#39;ve died while grouped.  i.e. avg<br/>
number of monsters killed per death incurred.  So if a cleric<br/>
had a tendency to let group members die, you could avoid him<br/>
without having to experience several deaths for yourself.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Nutty idea, doesn&#39;t fit into roleplaying, but fun to think<br/>
about.  Though a number like this would focus attention away<br/>
from self-improvement (or self-preservation as the case may<br/>
be), and more towards group cooperation.<br/>
