<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Thurgadim hunting? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464626768">Icewell Keep is pretty rough.  Certain creatures in there are unmezzable<br/>
(frost spikes...at least our chanter couldnt) and if you lose a corpse deep<br/>
in (such as when a creature flees, party doesnt zone and someone gets<br/>
summoned and killed) you are in for a long CR.  I was in a group with a lvl<br/>
58 cleric, lvl 54 necro, 56 warrior, 53 bard (me), 54 enchanter and 51<br/>
shaman and we could handle ONE frost spike at a time...two and we were dead.<br/>
Everything we fought in there hit for 180+.  Alot of the crushed gems for<br/>
the Thurgadin quests dropped for us, as well as the new Cleric|necro<br/>
improved invis to undead spell.<br/>
<br/>
The same group went to Chardok the next day and it felt like a walk in the<br/>
park compared to the keep.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; anyone hunt in Thurgadim? I was lost in there other night and came upon a<br/>
&gt; curve where i saw a bat on the other side, it conned blue to me at 42 and<br/>
&gt; ready to attack where as all the dwarves were amiable to me.  So i guess<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a mini dungeon in there. Anyone try it out yet?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And for that matter anyone try icewell keep yet? i zoned in by accident,<br/>
&gt; hit<br/>
&gt; tracking and everything on track was red to me except for 1 sentry which<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; blue.<br/>
