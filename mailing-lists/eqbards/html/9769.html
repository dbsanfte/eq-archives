<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-675928219">I payed 60pp for a Lambent stone last night (was asking 100pp), I also got<br/>
myself 2 sapphires and now all I need is the rune from Choon in WK. Anyone<br/>
know hard this is to get, bearing in mind I am only level 27. My friend<br/>
will help me kill him (level 28 Mage) so I think we could take him, can<br/>
anyone tell me how hard Choon is to locate??<br/>

Agreed. I know a lot of rogues on E&#39;ci have banded together and refused to<br/>
purchase Ravenscale armor from anyone.  20PP seems like a fair price for<br/>
the<br/>
lambent stones so thats as far as I will go.<br/>
