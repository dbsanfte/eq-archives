&gt;    Elijah, Where did you get the &quot;NoteMissing&quot; and &quot;Stunnable&quot;<br/>
&gt; statements in your ini file ?  I didn&#39;t know you could mess with other<br/>
&gt; things and what does<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Stunnable=FALSE&quot; do ?<br/>
&gt;    I am saving my Ini file and copying yours into Moonflower&#39;s this<br/>
&gt; morning to see what it looks like...just wanted to know what I am<br/>
&gt; getting into. Saved the old file just incase :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just a little hopefulness....*grin*  No, they don&#39;t do anything, but<br/>
wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if they did? :)<br/>

After last night I have found that despite what the tool says Duels still<br/>
come across in yellow, so it might be the /yell color, in which case it goes<br/>
to some bright color in mine. Also I think shout could come up a bit, I<br/>
think I over-muted. Oooh, but looove the gray for damage messages, it really<br/>
puts it where I can easily pick it out.<br/>
