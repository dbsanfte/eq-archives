&gt;         Bards can indeed wear plate. I&#39;ve been told that you need a minimum<br/>
&gt; strength of 80 to do so effectively. I don&#39;t know if this allows for the<br/>
&gt; carrying of any loot since the best thing I have so far is snakeskin.<br/>

able to carry anything worthwhile, you need a strength in the<br/>
neighbourhood of 120.  <br/>
<br/>
I know, scary isn&#39;t it?  Considering that pretty much all bards start<br/>
with a strength under 100 to start, this seems like a mean trick played<br/>
by Verant.  Add to that the fact that the easiest platemail to get is<br/>
bronze plate, which is even heavier, wearing plate seems like a pipe<br/>
dream for bards. <br/>
<br/>
It is possible though, with the use of strength enhancing items.  <br/>
<br/>
My bard has a strength of 97 after all my magic items are taken into<br/>
account, and I wear several pieces of bronze plate comfortably.  Could I<br/>
wear a whole suit?  No way. Can I wear enough to get a very good armour<br/>
class and to look pretty cool at the same time?  Yes.  :)<br/>

The more important application for a bard, though, is that it reduces<br/>
the number of &quot;missed notes&quot; you suffer.   <br/>
