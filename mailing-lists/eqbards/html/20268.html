<b>Subject:</b> Wonderful weekend and advice needed <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045997069">This weekend was absolutely fabulous. When I logged in on Saturday night, I<br/>
was about halfway through 26.<br/>
<br/>
Some friends of mine were hunting giants in Frontier Mountains, so I went to<br/>
join them. Fantastic group with an awesome monk puller who never stopped the<br/>
whole night. We took down giant after giant, and ended up looting lots of<br/>
decent stuff (40 - 60pp items) including a Forest Loop! Of course, I didn&#39;t<br/>
win that roll.<br/>
<br/>
As the evening progressed everyone decided it was time for bed. By this time<br/>
I was a little less than half a bub from 27. No way I could go to bed<br/>
without charm, so I trucked over the Lake of Ill Omen, and proceeded to<br/>
ding! Feeling satisfied with the evening I went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday afternoon I logged in and tried my hand at charm kiting. Oh the<br/>
thrill! It was a blast and I made half a bub in about 45 minutes while<br/>
learning the ropes before I had to log off.<br/>
<br/>
That evening I logged back on and my friends were just showing up again for<br/>
another run at the mountain giants, so I joined them. Our monk was a pulling<br/>
fanatic again, and another Forest Loop dropped! Much to my surprise, I won<br/>
the roll for it, and immediately got offer 2kpp for it from a guildmate<br/>
(accepted this offer).<br/>
<br/>
Now after this nice windfall, I would like to ask my fellow bards for some<br/>
help deciding what to upgrade in my equipment list. My current equipment is<br/>
as follows:<br/>
<br/>
head: Crown of the Froglok King (gift from a retiring RL friend)<br/>
face: Small Bronze Mask<br/>
left ear: Opaline Earring<br/>
right ear: Opaline Earring<br/>
neck: Spiked Collar (or +3 cha necklace for charming)<br/>
shoulder: BS Mantle<br/>
arms: Small Bronze Vambraces<br/>
left wrist: Lambent Bracer (or +7 cha bracelet for charming)<br/>
right wrist: Lambent Bracer (or +7 cha bracelet for charming)<br/>
hands: Small Bronze Gauntlets<br/>
left finger: Jagged Band<br/>
right finger: Jagged Band<br/>
chest: Small Bronze Breastplate (guildmate has a Lambent Breastplate for me)<br/>
back: Polar Bear Cloak<br/>
waist: Thick Leather Apron<br/>
legs: Lambent Greaves<br/>
feet: Small Bronze Boots<br/>
<br/>
primary weapon: Bladed Thulian Claw (or Gnoll Hide Lariat when in high melee<br/>
group)<br/>
secondary weapon: Silvery War Axe (or Gnoll Hide Lariat when in high melee<br/>
group)<br/>
ranged slot: Dragoon Dirk<br/>
<br/>
string: Mandolin<br/>
percussion: MM Drum<br/>
wind: Minotaur Horn<br/>
brass: Horn <br/>
<br/>
I know the collar and cloak should be upgraded, but I&#39;m not sure what to go<br/>
with. I was thinking a Cloak of the Icebear maybe, but have no ideas on the<br/>
collar. Any other ideas?<br/>
