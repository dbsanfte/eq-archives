<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562996339">Spectres (and other mobs) agro is also partly based on a level check.  The<br/>
Spec island when fully populated has at least 4 (one each cornor) and 3<br/>
(tower lower and 2 upper).  At 33, given the social range, you will get<br/>
multiple spectres.  Also, your hp is no where near high enough to sustain<br/>
any amount of damage from them.  At level 45, it was damn hard for me to<br/>
solo spectres there.  The problem being getting multiple pulls and resists.<br/>
By 47, it was loads easier to pull singles and I still used Lament alot.  I<br/>
just dont see this as being a productive venture for you at 33.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, you should be able to find loads of stuff to charm kite<br/>
in the great outdoors over in Kunark.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Solo Spectre Camp Break?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was cruising my little &#39;ol blue level 33 self across the Oasis and <br/>
recalled that I was able to charm a Spectre not to long ago (with lots of <br/>
resists, but I was successful).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone successfully broken the camp solo? The Spectres are so slow and <br/>
we can run over the water pretty easily, figured someone must have done<br/>
this.</div>
