<div id="ygrps-yiv-28537398">I think that was part of the point I was trying to make.  That it was<br/>
difficult to tell if the level 31 drop was really bigger than the level 30<br/>
drop since the level 30 bubbles are so much bigger than the level 31 ones.<br/>
Since I saw a bigger drop across levels on non-hell levels (or are they<br/>
mini-hell levels?) I wondered if it wasn&#39;t really a double dipping situation<br/>
rather than a loss that was significantly greater one level up.<br/>

&gt; Hmmm, sent that before I finished or wasn&#39;t clear or something.  The next<br/>
&gt; death at 31 dropped him from two full bubbles down to just a sliver over<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; bubble.  It was definitely more than the visual lost xp when he dropped to<br/>
&gt; 30th by at least double.  Could be some distortion from the end of bar<br/>
&gt; decorations, but wouldn&#39;t think it was that much.    It definitely<br/>
appeared<br/>
&gt; that he lost at least twice as much visible bubble space in pixels when he<br/>
&gt; dropped from 2 bubbles and didn&#39;t lose any 30th level xp as it did when<br/>
part<br/>
&gt; of the xp loss came out of 30th.<br/>
<br/>
But then you&#39;re trying to compare level 30 bubbles to level 31<br/>
bubbles, which is literally apples to oranges.  You have to<br/>
compare using the same units.  In my anecdote and my take on<br/>
your anecdote, it was level 30 bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
All you&#39;ve really shown is that level 30 bubbles are a lot<br/>
bigger than level 31 bubbles, which we already know since<br/>
level 30 a hell level.  :)<br/>
