<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083420183">since the info came out about the haste cap i don&#39;t remember the last time<br/>
SLW was cast by our enchanters.  it is always augmentation, as every tank we<br/>
have has a haste item.  SLW will get any player to the haste cap regardless<br/>
of items, therefore with any items it seems to be a waste.  i did hear<br/>
however that the haste cap was bumped up on the test server in expectation<br/>
of kunark.  we&#39;re guessing it is probably around 100% now instead of 60%.<br/>

&gt; Hmmm, our enchanters will swift our tanks and yes they all have haste<br/>
&gt; equipment of some sort (FBSS, Planes belts, etc.)  It&#39;s our <br/>
&gt; SOP to SLTW on<br/>
&gt; tanks at the end of the buffing.  This is for Dragons and <br/>
&gt; Gods.  Also for<br/>
&gt; general work in the planes our tanks beg for swift.  I am not <br/>
&gt; sure abou the<br/>
&gt; cap on a weapon speed nor what it takes to reach the cap.  We <br/>
&gt; buff SLTW<br/>
&gt; religiously. </span></blockquote></div>
