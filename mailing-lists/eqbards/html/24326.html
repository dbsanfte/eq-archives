Subject: [eqbards] Melody of Ervaj<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I took a break from EQ just before SoV came out and I just recently <br/>
started playing a lot again.  Well, during the break I was a little <br/>
out of the loop so I have a couple of questions regarding this song.  <br/>
First off, I know that this is a mob dropped spell in Velious.  What <br/>
zones/mobs is it most commonly found on?  And... What are people <br/>
paying/charging for this song?<br/>
<br/>
Please help, thanks ;)<br/>
