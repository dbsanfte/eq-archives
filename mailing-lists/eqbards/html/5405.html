<b>Subject:</b> a Bards rant on getting thru hell level part one (lvl 30) -long txt <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723645611">-4am, woke up to nagging alarm. Stumbled to the pc, logging in to eq, eyes<br/>
still can&#39;t focus quite right as I start taking out aviaks in south karana,<br/>
but I have two bubbles to go, &quot;shouldn&#39;t be that tough&quot; I say to myself.<br/>
<br/>
-7am, servers go down for maintenance, actually manage to get a few things<br/>
done around the appt<br/>
<br/>
-9am, servers supposed to be up, but aren&#39;t.  I constantly pound on the &#39;let<br/>
me in&#39; key untill a little after 10am when it finally works<br/>
<br/>
-kill aviaks over and over and over.. eventually get one charm, so I can<br/>
quest, hey, I have a little less than a bub to go, whohoo!<br/>
<br/>
-4pm, see an auction from a friend on a well ballanced scim, that my druid<br/>
would love.  She transports me to gfay, (bonus, now I can give shield and<br/>
scim to my druid)<br/>
<br/>
-now I realize that I&#39;m in gfay, and need to get exp, I shudder at the<br/>
thought of going to mistmoore, but my guild meet is there tonight anyhow,<br/>
so I decided to brave the ubber-trains and try for some exp (still have just<br/>
about a bub to go)<br/>
<br/>
-Mistmoore: not bad, kinda camped, which is good, less trains. solo a bit,<br/>
get a little exp, but slow going.  I manage to avoid a few of those<br/>
ubber-trains, and made it thru alive all night (rare). I realize its getting<br/>
late (now 9pm) and I still have more than half a bub to go. I&#39;m determined<br/>
to level before I log, and get out of &quot;hell level&quot;. So I dig in.  I<br/>
join a group (so I don&#39;t have to KS from them) and slowly get exp.  Around<br/>
11pm a train comes thru taking out half the zone, most of the group decides<br/>
thats enough, and calls it quits.  I grp with a guild member who was there,<br/>
and in my dazed state (now having been up for 20 hrs) procede to take on<br/>
every single mob that was there, even green, just in case it gave me exp.<br/>
<br/>
-Midnight, finally, I get lvl 31! I scribe, and learn my new song, group<br/>
leviate (fun) and force my guild to congratulate me :) I zone, camp, then go<br/>
to bed.. wake up 4 hrs later to come to work (yawn)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I now understand why so many ppl stop playing thier char&#39;s at lvl 30.  I get<br/>
 track at lvl 35, and am hoping that it will help to soften the blow of<br/>
&#39;hell level&#39; part two.<br/>
