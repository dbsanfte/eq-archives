<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-918028785">Yes I&#39;ve used this tactic with groups I&#39;m in before.  It works out very well if the group really knows what they&#39;re doing.  Actually in a group of 3 tanks, 1 bard, 1 healer, and a blaster we would routinely pull 4 critters.  Each of the tanks would take one and the casters would ping-pong the other (or I would tank it if I got it&#39;s attention)<br/>
<br/>
The songs I use in this situation are the tried and true:<br/>
<br/>
HoR, DDD, CoD, Largo&#39;s  <br/>
This is tough to keep up but it works amazingly well.  Usualy I can keep all four going unless one jumps on me, if he does I just go to HoR, DDD, COD pure instrument.  In this way I&#39;m &quot;Assisting&quot; every tank.  Thus they&#39;re getting the &quot;full&quot; help of my songs so that it&#39;s as if two people were on each mob.<br/>
<br/>
Works REALLY well if you&#39;re pulling blues (and even white/yellow sometimes till level 30ish anyway, after that the buggers just hit too hard and you have to stick to blues)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wondering that if in situations where you get 2+ mobs, that it might<br/>
&gt; actually be smarter if the tanks in the group each attacked a different mob.<br/>
&gt; It would take longer to kill all the mobs, but it would help ensure that<br/>
&gt; damage to the group was spread out better.  Plus, if all the mobs are<br/>
&gt; engaged, it would be safer for bards to sing Largos to debuff mob attack<br/>
&gt; speed.  Its quite possible that the damage multiple mobs inflict using this<br/>
&gt; tactic (Largos in effect all the time) would be very close to the damage<br/>
&gt; they inflict when everyone focuses on one at a time. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone had a lot of experience fighting in groups that followed the<br/>
&gt; second line of reasoning?  I&#39;d like to hear what your results were.<br/>
