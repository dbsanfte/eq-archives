&gt; Anyone care to comment on my observation that Lament song will change the<br/>
&gt; faction con?  E.g.: I lament a Spectre and it goes from blue scowling to<br/>
&gt; blue indifferent.  I have done this several times.  Not being a true tester,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s what I used to do to test if the lament was still<br/>
on - /con everything I&#39;d lamented.  I thought they&#39;d fixed<br/>
this so it didn&#39;t work anymore.  I haven&#39;t done it in about 8<br/>
months.<br/>

&gt; Bardette of 48 songs (I was 48 for almost a whole day and I&#39;ll be 48 again<br/>
&gt; so for now I am 48 -.05 bub no biggie ;p)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh.  I died 4 times (including my second death to Innoruk in<br/>
straight melee - the bastard still refuses to Death Touch me),<br/>
lost level 48 4 times, got it back 3 times with the res, and<br/>
got the last one back with exp I made while on Hate.  So I am<br/>
at 48 + .01.  :)<br/>
