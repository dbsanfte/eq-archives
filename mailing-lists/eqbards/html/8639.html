<b>Subject:</b> Root, pumice stones. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671177666">Almost forgot this.  While testing root/Accelerando in the<br/>
arena, I noticed that while Accelerando started after you&#39;re<br/>
rooted will not break root, if you had Accelerando playing<br/>
when you&#39;re rooted and you leave it playing, the next pulse<br/>
*will* break the root.  So if you keep Accelerando playing<br/>
while pulling from Unrest, and you&#39;re not stunned/bashed out<br/>
of your song at an inopportune time, the longest you can be<br/>
rooted for is 6 seconds.  I think this happens because the<br/>
root does not remove the Accel icon (it removes the SoW icon).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still probably a better idea to carry a pumice stone with<br/>
you at all times.  One problem I noticed with the stone is<br/>
that it won&#39;t work if you have a song playing.  Turn off the<br/>
song and the stone works fine.<br/>
<br/>
Chaining yourself will break the root as well, but you will be<br/>
unable to get Accelerando started again until the root icon<br/>
disappears (which a pumice stone will do - yet another reason<br/>
to use them).<br/>
