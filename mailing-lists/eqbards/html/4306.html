<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965214698">hehe it wasn&#39;t easy when we killed him.  he was green but mind you very<br/>
tough.  he is probably around level 35, but since he is a named npc fights a<br/>
LOT harder.  we didn&#39;t kill him cause he had our lute, we never gave him a<br/>
lute, just cause we were mad at him for not being part of the wakizishi<br/>
quest.  how dare he?!?!<br/>

&gt; &gt; him to talk about the quest, and gave him the lute.  all <br/>
&gt; Grimlot did was<br/>
&gt; &gt; equip the lute, so they had to kill him but was able to <br/>
&gt; loot the lute<br/>
&gt; &gt; (hehe).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Grr...  Wish I could do that to all the stupid NPCs who&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; said &quot;Thank you very much&quot; and taken what I thought were<br/>
&gt; correct quest items...<br/>
