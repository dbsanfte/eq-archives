<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680760534">Actually - if you&#39;re talking about my posts I WAS talking about trade<br/>
skills as well.<br/>
<br/>
But yes - when I do adventure - I prefer to be in the background supporting<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
The only other class I ever played was enchanter - and much for the same<br/>
reasons - they are much better at support than being the center of attention.<br/>
<br/>
If trade skills were what they SHOULD be - they&#39;d be the same way.<br/>

&gt;By non-combat he is talking SUPPORT roles, not trade skills.  I can do much <br/>
&gt;more damage buffing/healing/debuffing then I can with a couple of puny <br/>
&gt;blades.  Every since I demolished a lvl 26th Paladin at 22nd lvl, using no <br/>
&gt;weapons BTW, I have been a firm believer in the power of the Bard&#39;s song.  <br/>
&gt;If you are limiting yourself to only being on the front line swinging your <br/>
&gt;sword at the creatures face, you are limiting yourself and not helping the <br/>
&gt;party to your full abilities.  It also takes a lot more bravely to face down <br/>
&gt;a horde of ice goblins with nothing more then a lute equiped :)<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;Give me a noncombatant role any day of the week.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I think overall as a class - MOST bards - at least those well suited to <br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;role have matured past having to be the center of attention and HERO of <br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;day.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Uh... In EQ there really isn&#39;t much non combat (Trade Skills), and what<br/>
&gt;&gt;minor features the game provides in that area are in need of a huge ammount<br/>
&gt;&gt;of work.  In short, if you like non combat EverQuest just isn&#39;t for you.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;would never want to give anything away just for a skill where I target an<br/>
&gt;&gt;NPC or get within a certain distance and press a button, get a few copper <br/>
&gt;&gt;if<br/>
&gt;&gt;you are successful or nothing if you fail, and then do it over and over and<br/>
&gt;&gt;over and over again.  At least combat is a little more complex then that,<br/>
&gt;&gt;even if a bard is a twitch character.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Bards are the true jack of all trades in EQ, and I LOVE that.  I don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;&gt;have downtime compared to my other classes!  Forget meditating for five to<br/>
&gt;&gt;ten minutes after a fight, I am a bard.  :)  I get to run fast, wear armor,<br/>
&gt;&gt;get weapons, duel weild, cast spells in the form of songs, have  a very<br/>
&gt;&gt;diverse list of song abilities, and to top it all off I get tracking!  We<br/>
&gt;&gt;get some of everything.  We may not be masters at any on thing, but boy is<br/>
&gt;&gt;it fun to do so much!<br/>
