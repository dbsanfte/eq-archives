<b>Subject:</b> Anyone out there grouping with druids? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961212669">Druids have some nifty damage shield spells.  These are the<br/>
kind that do damage to the attacker every time you&#39;re hit.<br/>
Since bards often end up being the mob magnet, I was wondering<br/>
if anyone had tried getting a druid to cast a couple of these<br/>
on you (there are two types - one low damage/long duration,<br/>
one high damage/short duration, both stack - cast the latter<br/>
just as a fight starts).<br/>
<br/>
I just started using these with my L9 druid character, and I<br/>
can attack two or three blue mobs at once.  By the time I&#39;ve<br/>
finished the first, the other two are down to about half hp<br/>
just from beating on me.  Of course, these are goblins who<br/>
tend to be pretty wimpy fighters in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
A goblin HITS you for 1 point of damage<br/>
A goblin is pierced by thorns<br/>
A goblins says &quot;hit by 6 points non-melee damage&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lotsa fun watching them kill themselves.  :-)<br/>
