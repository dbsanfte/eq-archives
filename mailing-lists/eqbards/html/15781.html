<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158513424">Renumber the old &#39;70&#39;s anti-drug thing &quot;Speed Kills&quot;? Well in EQ - it<br/>
equates to &quot;Lag Kills&quot;.  If you are getting bad PL or anything else that<br/>
causes bad lag - stay away from Sol A.  I fell in once due to bad lag.<br/>
<br/>
The next thing - it&#39;s VERY dangerous to start running through the lava<br/>
trying to find your way out.  I had a corpse retrieval from hell once<br/>
because I ran.  There is a &quot;Lavafall&quot; thing (like a waterfall but lava)<br/>
that&#39;s one way.  There are only two ways out.<br/>
<br/>
1) Group with someone with Group Gate.  Levitate your way through the<br/>
channel to your corpse.  Loot then gate out.<br/>
<br/>
I basically tried this unsuccessfully.  They may have changed it - but at<br/>
the time you couldn&#39;t renew Levitate until after it ran out.  My druid<br/>
friend ended up dying before we could gate out....<br/>
<br/>
I ended up doing this:<br/>
<br/>
1) if you can keep going long enough without dying - you can zone to sol b -<br/>
walk through some more lava - and be able to get out. Hopefully you won&#39;t<br/>
get jumped in Sol B.  Given that Sol B is pretty crowded you&#39;ll probably be<br/>
safe.<br/>

&gt; The best method that I have learned for lava corpse recoveries is Don&#39;t<br/>
Fall<br/>
&gt; In!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course it&#39;s not always as easy as all that, so there&#39;s a little trick<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; can do when you fall into lava (at least by the Lavastorm entrance of Sol<br/>
A,<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t tried it in any of the other lava, but may work).<br/>
