<div id="ygrps-yiv-797421748">From an old rogue, sneak is a skill that will allow u to walk very quietly<br/>
by violent creatures.  U know if sneak is working if u start walking half of<br/>
your walk speed.  The sneak skill at high lvl like in the 80&#39;s or higher<br/>
will allow u to sneak by many creatures of yellows and down.  I would not<br/>
try it against a red though.  The chances of not being seen is slim.  The<br/>
sneak skill is very useful for retrieving your dead body and Pick pocketing<br/>
but since we do not have it then it is mostly good for retrieving your body.<br/>
With our speed song we can just run by all creatures.  Who need to sneak?  I<br/>
hoped this help.<br/>

Hail fellow Bards!<br/>
<br/>
I would be really glad if anyone could explain me the use of the sneak<br/>
skill. I haven&#39;t seen one person in the game who could explain me how it<br/>
works<br/>
and what it really does. It is said that monsters can&#39;t hear you when your<br/>
sneaking, but I really doubt that this is very usefull. I don&#39;t know either<br/>
how to use it correctly. Do you have to be in walk mode to start sneaking?<br/>
Sometimes I just can&#39;t hit the sneak button for hours, i don&#39;t know why.<br/>
I would really appreciate every kind of help...<br/>
