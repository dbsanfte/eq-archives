<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914424004">Constant swapping for instruments and weapons is only for the truely insane.<br/>
I may switch back and forth during a battle as is called for, but not<br/>
constantly.  You might want to remind your groupmate that EQ is after all a<br/>
social game and it is impossible to be social while twisting constantly.  If<br/>
I am in a group and all is well, I have no problem only leaving one song<br/>
playing so I can chat with my friends, in group, tells, or guildsay.  So<br/>
tell that monk to relax =)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt whose <br/>
&gt; main is a bard<br/>
&gt; (an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and <br/>
&gt; there... &quot;less<br/>
&gt; talking more twisting!&quot; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three <br/>
&gt; to four songs<br/>
&gt; but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>
&gt; question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory <br/>
&gt; slots, and #2 bank<br/>
&gt; set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, <br/>
&gt; switch to #1, switch<br/>
&gt; out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new song without<br/>
&gt; missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one of <br/>
&gt; those things<br/>
&gt; that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to switch hotkey<br/>
&gt; banks...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Oh, btw, play with people 8 levels lower than you!  I played <br/>
&gt; with a monk my<br/>
&gt; level and a warrior 8 levels higher.  He went through 40 in <br/>
&gt; the same amount<br/>
&gt; of time it took us to go through 34 (about 3.5 hours).  Sick.<br/>
