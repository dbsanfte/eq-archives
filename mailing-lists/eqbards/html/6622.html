This is DEFINITELY A SPOILER on the Mithril Quill<br/>

OK, the Mithril quill, as stated previously is a 4/19 primary hand only magic<br/>
piercing weapon that also grants the user +20 HP.  Since the only people that<br/>
can use it that would want to  are bards, the cost should be cheap (if you can<br/>
find one)  It is only useable by Int casters and bards, and bards are the only<br/>
one of those 5 classes that would really want it.  I paid 25pp for 2 of them<br/>
(not knowing they were Primary only :-(  )  I would suspect that they would go<br/>
for anywhere from 15pp to 30pp each.  the sad part is that they are usually<br/>
destroyed by the people that get them.  Here&#39;s the REAL spoiler....the Quill is<br/>
dropped in Solusek A, off of a gnome named Gabbie (sp?).  Wisdom casters like<br/>
to camp the crap out of Gabbie because her rare drop is the Molten Cloak (4AC,<br/>
+4Wis, +4int)  The common drop off of her is the mithril quill.  I have heard<br/>
it is a not-uncommon occurrence for someone to get 15 mithril quills before<br/>
getting the Molten Cloak.<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to get it would probably be to make friends with a high 20&#39;s<br/>
Wisdom or Int caster, just found out the cloak is all/all caster, and drop<br/>
hints about the molten cloak : )  That would probably get you a Quill (or 2)<br/>
pretty darn quick.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
