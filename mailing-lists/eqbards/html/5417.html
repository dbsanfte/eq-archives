<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695624919">Uhm, I think you are wrong about how hymn works, or I just misread your<br/>
post.  You seem to be implying that each time you sing hymn, it has an<br/>
effect.  This is not true.  The song acts much (exactly) like a Druids or<br/>
Shaman&#39;s regen spells, in that it increases the amount of health regenerated<br/>
for each normal recovery point, which come about 6 seconds apart, just the<br/>
effect is either on or off, it doesn&#39;t add a certain amount of health for<br/>
each time the song takes effect.  Also, is the 13 healed points per tick<br/>
when they are standing, or sitting?<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to get things cleared up.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know this is a controversial issue, with many people<br/>
&gt; staunchly believing it doesn&#39;t make sense to play Hymn during<br/>
&gt; a fight at higher levels.  But I thought I&#39;d toss out some<br/>
&gt; numbers I happened to calculate during last night&#39;s play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Two paladins and I (L31, 32, 31) were wandering Guk and<br/>
&gt; happened across the ancient crocodile.  It /conned blue so we<br/>
&gt; decided to give it a shot as they both had lay hands ready.<br/>
&gt; One of them has ghoulbane and the other has a blackened iron<br/>
&gt; bastard sword, so in general I do less than half the damage<br/>
&gt; one of them can do in a fight.  Hence I&#39;d mostly been playing<br/>
&gt; with my lute singing Hymn along with Anthem and Chain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The croc hits hard, with a max hit of around 72 and often<br/>
&gt; double-attacking.  Buffed out, the paladins had about 1000 hp<br/>
&gt; (200 hp per bubble), I had abaout 750.  The fight lasted 27<br/>
&gt; song pulses, and ended with one paladin down to 2 bubbles, the<br/>
&gt; other down below 1 (he stepped back to heal himself near the<br/>
&gt; end), for a net deficit of 1400-1500 hp.  (They are both very<br/>
&gt; good at using taunt and stopping attacks to evenly distribute<br/>
&gt; the damage they&#39;re taking.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hymn at my level with a lute heals 13 points per tick.  In 27<br/>
&gt; pulses with both paladins wounded, it healed roughly 702<br/>
&gt; points, for a total deficit of 2100-2200 hp.  That is, even in<br/>
&gt; a fight against an opponent who often double-hit for 60-70,<br/>
&gt; and with just two people wounded, Hymn with a lute was able to<br/>
&gt; &quot;reduce&quot; the damage taken during the fight by roughly 30%.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I&#39;d equipped my weapons and joined in the fighting, I<br/>
&gt; would&#39;ve boosted our damage rate by about 20% (assuming I do<br/>
&gt; half the damage of either of them).  That would&#39;ve resulted in<br/>
&gt; the croc dying 20% faster, and us taking ~430 points less<br/>
&gt; damage.  Hymn without a lute heals 7 points a tick, so over 22<br/>
&gt; rounds it would&#39;ve healed 308 points.  Add these to get 738<br/>
&gt; points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So we probably would&#39;ve done slightly better with me using my<br/>
&gt; weapons instead of singing Hymn.  But remember that this is<br/>
&gt; with just two people wounded.  If the group had been bigger,<br/>
&gt; the benefit of using Hymn with a lute would&#39;ve been greater,<br/>
&gt; while the impact of me using my weapons would&#39;ve been smaller.<br/>
&gt; So it *can* make sense to use Hymn with a lute during a fight<br/>
&gt; at this level.  Most of the monsters we were fighting weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; doing as much damage as the croc, and I was primarily using<br/>
&gt; Hymn to keep as close as possible to max hp in case things got<br/>
&gt; ugly and we had to run for the zone.<br/>
