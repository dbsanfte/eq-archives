<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700217549">Hi, Jacana!  You ARE awfully cute.  :)  I&#39;ll have to try that with my favorite complaining Cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Went to Hate last night.  Innoruuk was down because a GM depopped him two nights previous due to some<br/>
guild petitioning.  What they said to convince him to do that, I don&#39;t know.  Without Inny up, we cleared<br/>
in 6.5 hours, including Maestro.  I only died once, in a mass death caused, I believe, by a late party<br/>
arriving and being too dumb to just bite the bullet in the SW corner.  I&#39;m not sure though, since I sank<br/>
like a lead balloon.  I only recall dying more quickly on one other occasion (four MOBs hitting me<br/>
simultaneously in Sebilis).  I actually had time to type &quot;where&#39;s the damn mez?&quot; and hit &lt;enter&gt; before I<br/>
croaked.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for the anti-poison suggestion to deal with Maestro&#39;s AE Lifetap.  I believe I saw him try<br/>
to cast it three times (green effects on all the close-range tanks), and my party&#39;s three tanks took just<br/>
about no damage from any of them.  We crushed him, no deaths.  Since the only other Bard up there has been<br/>
up about 50 times (I don&#39;t think I&#39;m exaggerating), she has everything that Hate has to offer, so all Bard<br/>
drops were mine.  Of course, my guild had to jinx it by saying that Maestro always drops at least two<br/>
things.  Only one this time, but it was Kelin&#39;s Lute!  Also got an Imbrued Bracer, which I will proudly<br/>
wear,  even though the Lambent is better. Sigh.  A better night than the last three trips I&#39;ve made there<br/>
put together, where a total of one Bard item dropped, and we got slaughtered by Maestro four times.<br/>

PS - Is the Sarnak Fort good for level 24s?  I want to find someplace in Lake of Ill Omen where my Warrior<br/>
can sit for a few levels.  She&#39;s too darned slow to move around.<br/>

&gt; in the Lake of Ill Omen.  We just stood there and everything ran to us -<br/>
&gt; well me.  Every mob came at me :) but then I could not blame them I am just<br/>
&gt; so cute.  Ummm anyways... My group started to yell for me to log so I did.<br/>
&gt; Me alone.  And guess what happened?  The mobs still came and they started to<br/>
&gt; beat on the cleric instead.  *LOL* He screams like a girl - ON ME ON ME.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever going to ask me to log again...<br/>
