<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863047457">Just dinged 51 last night and used this song for the first time.  With Selos<br/>
Drum equipped, the movement rate with the 51 song seemed to be slower than<br/>
Selos Accelerando.  I was in Burning Woods so that may have had an impact on<br/>
my perception.  Is the speed bonus for these songs the same or is<br/>
Accelerando indeed faster?  I have read that when you have a regular<br/>
levitate buff up and sing Selos, the fastest you will go is SOW speed.  This<br/>
is approximately how fast I was going last night with SSoT.  So either SSoT<br/>
is slower because of the levitate effect or my perception was off.  <br/>
