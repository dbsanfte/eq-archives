&gt; I am currently at lvl 20.  I do not see the used of lvl 20<br/>
&gt; song at all and I was hoping that it does what the song<br/>
&gt; list say it does which is -AC and slow down the attack<br/>
&gt; rate.  I do not see that when I used it against a blue.  <br/>
&gt; It said that it is binding and all.  could anyone tell me<br/>
&gt; if they have ever had any success with this song?  Also I<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to time this, but haven&#39;t gotten around to<br/>
it.  Visually, I seem to notice them hitting slower.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; am very close to lvl 21 and I was wondering if I should<br/>
&gt; buy it since I am very short on PP.  The lvl 21 song is<br/>
&gt; supposed to be very similar to lvl 20 right?<br/>
<br/>
L21 is Mellifluous Motion - a random teleport within the zone.<br/>
I think you are talking about the L23 song, the Constant<br/>
Chain.  This is basically a short-term snare (never seen it<br/>
last more than the standard 3 ticks).  It is VERY useful for<br/>
snagging those monsters that like to run and bring back<br/>
friends, especially since the bard can &quot;cast&quot; it while chasing<br/>
(spellcasters can&#39;t do that).  I think it was weakened<br/>
recently, as last night I had mobs I&#39;d chained breaking out of<br/>
it frequently before the 3 ticks were up, and a couple times<br/>
almost immediately.  I&#39;d rarely seen that before.<br/>
<br/>
The L21 song is fun to play with, but it&#39;s not necessary.<br/>
Save your platinum if you like.<br/>
