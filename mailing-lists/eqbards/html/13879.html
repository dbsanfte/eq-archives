&gt;&gt; Hmmm, awhile back I posted some tips on how bards can use bard hatred to<br/>
&gt;&gt; their advantage to help level up lower players very quickly.  At that time<br/>
&gt;&gt; - I predicted if Verant ever figured this out......<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Things that make ya go hmmmmm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, after you get charm, you quickly figure out that the<br/>
&gt;easiest way to help level up lower level players is to beat<br/>
&gt;something to almost dead, charm it, and let them finish it<br/>
&gt;off.  Changing bard hatred won&#39;t affect that any.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True - never got my bard quite to charm - almost.  Chains and lullaby were<br/>
all I ever needed to help the really low level guys powerlevel like fiends<br/>
- thank you bard hatred.<br/>
<br/>
The last month or so - been on the (almost) newest server as a wizard.<br/>
Gotta say - casters die more often???? Uhhhh - not my wizard. If I die once<br/>
a level - I have really screwed up. With my bard - it was more like once a<br/>
night. Seriously considering starting a bard on this server there aren&#39;t<br/>
many - and the ones I&#39;ve run across are new bards - and not terribly well<br/>
versed in what a bard is really all about.</div>
