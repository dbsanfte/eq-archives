<b>Subject:</b> RE: Rumor of the bards ultimate weapon? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-173149808">Around 7pm central time - I poked my head into the Kith zone and was greeted<br/>
by a zone fight with some reds with new names.  Most everyone was fleeing to<br/>
the zone and when it was just me and 2 mobs left I stepped back into safety<br/>
of west c.<br/>
<br/>
Then med, healed who ever needed some and we popped back in - but it was now<br/>
&quot;day time&quot; such as it is in Kith.  People did their CR and kinda explored<br/>
but nothing was found.  I ran to RV for some banking and when I popped back<br/>
in for the next night fall (9pm spawn game-time rumor) but alas - nothing<br/>
happened.  So I joined my reg group and headed for Lguk.  Saw a system<br/>
message saying something about the event being over (although the reference<br/>
was to a different zone.)<br/>
<br/>
So - that&#39;s all I know.<br/>
