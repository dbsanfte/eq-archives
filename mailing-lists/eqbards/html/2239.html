<div id="ygrps-yiv-461875717">A combine weapon is a weapon though not really magic can hit targets that<br/>
can only be hit by magic, they also tend to be lighter and have a shorter<br/>
delay.  You can buy them at two gypsy camps in Antonica, the first is in N.<br/>
Karana in the gypsy camp along the road by the gaurd tower, the second is<br/>
located in the Oasis of Marr, at the Northeastern corner of the Oasis<br/>
itself.  You will pay 40+ pp for one but they are worth it, and...... You<br/>
dont have to stick em in the bank to keep them :).<br/>

&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Where would i go about finding combine weapons and/or magic weapons?<br/>
&gt;And another question, is a combine the same as a magic weapon?  I know<br/>
&gt;my friend can make me a magic sword, but it disappears after i log off<br/>
&gt;unless i stick it in the bank.  Any answer appreciated.  If long email<br/>
&gt;me directly please.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
