&gt; You would expect this to be the case but I don&#39;t think anyone has ever<br/>
&gt; confirmed it to be true.  This topic has been discussed on many occasions on<br/>
&gt; this list.  As far as I know, no one has been able to determine if AC is the<br/>
&gt; only factor in determining how much damage you receive per hit or if armor<br/>
&gt; type plays a role (i.e. deflects part of the blow).  Guess the best way to<br/>
&gt; test it is to find a monk with the same AC as you and start collecting data.<br/>

about 530 AC (plate) vs 450 AC (mesh).  At 530, wisps<br/>
regularly hit me for 1-2 points with the occasional 20+.  At<br/>
450 they regularly hit me for 20+ (I didn&#39;t count misses).<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;repeated&quot; this test about 10 levels later, at 540 AC but<br/>
naked.  Wisps were regularly hitting me for 1-2 points with<br/>
the occasional 20+.  If level is not a factor, then it would<br/>
seem only AC matters.  I believe Brad said as much recently.<br/>
I am firmly in the &quot;only AC matters&quot; camp at the moment.<br/>
