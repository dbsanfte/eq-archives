<div id="ygrps-yiv-181940646">When I first got the Ayre, just happened on a group interested in hunting<br/>
Aqua Goblins at the bottom of the Oasis lake in Oasis!  I stayed around the<br/>
goblin tower, and carried a Greater Lightstone.  This way folks always knew<br/>
where to swim to hear the song.  We had a few warriors and such, but a<br/>
Magician and his pet helped enormously is chasing those pesky fleeing<br/>
goblins.<br/>
<br/>
It was just a riot, watching these enormous trolls gently swimming over my<br/>
head, and we all had a great time.  Remember several of them saying they<br/>
never had so much fun in Everquest.<br/>
<br/>
Bad thing, those aqua goblins are right on the edge of giving you any<br/>
experience.  And it&#39;s kind of sad that this may be the only situation where<br/>
one can use the song in a group.  Travelling with the Aquatic Ayre would be<br/>
plain suicidal (I&#39;ve tried, and heard the notes of panic in friend&#39;s<br/>
voices).  The radius of it seems so narrow, folks will drown if they depend<br/>
on the bard to give them water breathing in most situations.<br/>

&gt;The water breathing song and it&#39;s possible uses was one of the big factors<br/>
&gt;in playiing a bard for me. Now that I have it I have done some exploring<br/>
&gt;(Everfrost river for one) but now I am looking for suggestions for new<br/>
