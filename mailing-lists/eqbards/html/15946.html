<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021196158">Yes, I have done this many times on Orcs, Goblins, Derv&#39;s . . . .   But you<br/>
only have to use it on one Orc in that zone.  It effects the faction of the<br/>
target, not the actual mob.  Since all the Orcs have the same faction<br/>
(&quot;Orc&quot; in Oasis) it will make you more appealing to anything with that<br/>
faction.  It lasts until you zone or log out.<br/>

&gt;I had been hunting orcs around in Oasys for some time. A last week (while I<br/>
&gt;was 16) I was soloing and the only place where I could find orcs was in<br/>
&gt;camp 1. but there were 4 of them (certain death...), so I decided to try<br/>
&gt;something different...<br/>
&gt;I used the charismatic carrilon on 3 of them, bringing their factions from<br/>
&gt;&quot;ready to attack&quot; to &quot;indiferent&quot; con, then I just ran through the camp and<br/>
&gt;got a safe and nice pull.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have any of you guys done this?<br/>
&gt;I have never heard anything concerning this strategy on this list... <br/>
&gt;Hope I have added something good.<br/>
