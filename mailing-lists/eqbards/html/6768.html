<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333031703"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; First off, in my twenties I can outdamage my cleric comrade in any melee<br/>

&gt;That clerics are weak at melee is not the point.  The point is<br/>
&gt;that all the classes that have weak defensive skills have<br/>

 </span></blockquote>or like bard nuking? Doing the DDD/CoD/Warmth/Heal dance does a LOT of<br/>

you have said you use it depending on the situation, so it sounds like a<br/>
