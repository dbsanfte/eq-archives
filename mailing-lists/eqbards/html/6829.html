&gt; 	This plate is so heavy I&#39;d think I&#39;d benefit greatly from a bag of sewn<br/>
&gt; evil eyes for my loot and weapons.. Can someone give me a rough estimate of<br/>
&gt; what these run in plat?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Something to add, based on my preliminary tests - Chains will override<br/>
all (?) other movement spells, but the previous spells icon remains on the<br/>
screen, which means until it is dispelled/ends/etc, you can&#39;t selo, only<br/>
move<br/>
at normal speed.  I didn&#39;t test this with all the spells, but its definately<br/>
a case<br/>
of removing a snare with chains - the snare icon remains, and selos has no<br/>
effect...<br/>

&gt; Ok, after a bit of testing, here&#39;s how it seems to work:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Root overrides SoW<br/>
&gt; Chain overrides Root<br/>
&gt; Accelerando overrides Chain<br/>
&gt; SoW overrides Accelerando<br/>
&gt; Root overrides Accelerado<br/>
&gt; Chain overrides Accelerando<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Accelerando does not override SoW<br/>
&gt; Accelerando does not override Root<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And someone else reported here that Chain overrides SoW, which<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t get to test.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (I hope I remembered all that right.)<br/>

less than that last night but he was asking 325 plat.<br/>
<br/>
By the way I hear they have a nasty bug.  Apparently they sometimes disappear along<br/>
with everything in them.  I plan to be cautious.<br/>
