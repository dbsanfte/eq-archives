&gt;anyway, as far as what to look forward to.  for one, you have the variety<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;using all songs available.  second, you have the opportunity to group up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;adventure into any zone or dungeon.  third, other than deep in high level<br/>
&gt;dungeons (unless grouped up), it is nice to be able to walk around freely<br/>
&gt;without worry from those nasties you always were looking over your shoulder<br/>
&gt;for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello all! Long time lurker, first time poster-<br/>
Shada, although I am only lvl 28 now, I have spent the last day or so just<br/>
travelling- hitting all those places that used to make me tremble :)- you&#39;re<br/>
right, it was fun going INTO Crushbone castle, walking right up to Dvinn,<br/>
and beating him into oblivion in about 30 seconds.<br/>
I spent the last 3 weeks powerleveling, and frankly I&#39;m burnt- don&#39;t care if<br/>
I never see another pickclaw! But my short term goal actually is to gain a<br/>
few more levels-(32 has a nice ring to it) and then spend some time actually<br/>
role playing a bit, travelling a bit,...... and maybe going back to<br/>
Crushbone and kicking Dvinn&#39;s butt just one more time :)</div>
