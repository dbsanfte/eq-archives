<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001185658">Didn&#39;t someone on this list fall victim to the infamous wcommons/befallen<br/>
&#39;cat room&#39; bug?  I was wondering how one could get into that room.  I have<br/>
seen screenshots of it, and of Befallen using the Eye of Zomm, but I don&#39;t<br/>
recall anyone saying how they got stuck in there.  The screenshot I remember<br/>
most was the one showing several npc shopkeeper&#39;s caught in the room as well<br/>
along with several other creatures including a young kodiak.  Anyone have<br/>
any more info on this?<br/>
