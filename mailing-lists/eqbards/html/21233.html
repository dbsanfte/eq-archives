<div id="ygrps-yiv-461412075">i was just basing that on debuffing myself.  it used to take 2 pulses per<br/>
buff on myself, but last time i tried it each buff came off with one pulse,<br/>
so dunno if they changed it or what.  we usually have a caster designated as<br/>
dispeller, and he calls off when he is done so people can snare, dot, slow,<br/>
etc.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; to me it usually seems that the only way you know if you&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; disenchanted something<br/>
&gt; is if the damage shield goes away.  only problem with that is <br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t know what<br/>
&gt; other buffs the mob has stacked on itself before the damage <br/>
&gt; shield.  so i think what is<br/>
&gt; happening is that you are dispelling something every time, <br/>
&gt; but maybe not the damage<br/>
&gt; shield, but since you get no message, you don&#39;t know that you <br/>
&gt; are.  also note that if <br/>
&gt; your casters start dropping dots and snares on the mob before <br/>
&gt; you hit the damage shield<br/>
&gt; you will essentially be dispelling those instead of the damage shield. </span></blockquote></div>
