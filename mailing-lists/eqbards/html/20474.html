<div id="ygrps-yiv-712759262">Hmm - my CHA (unbuffed) is 130 - and at level 44 charming (albeit probably<br/>
pretty high) blues was dismal.  I wonder if a) you&#39;re luckier than I am &lt;g&gt;<br/>
b) that last 8 CHA makes a huge difference or c) a stat other than CHA comes<br/>
into play?<br/>

Hmm I&#39;ve never had much problem with Pixie strike (then again I have 138<br/>
charisma without any buffs).  I can generally make it stick on anything blue<br/>
or lower regularly.  Anything white or higher is about a 30-40% sucess rate<br/>
but if it&#39;s blue I can mez it about 70% of the time.  So Pixie is always an<br/>
option in my song lineup.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to charm as crowd control though it tends to wrek havoc with pet<br/>
users who don&#39;t keep track of their pets (have had more mage pets damn near<br/>
kill me than I can count).  But if we get a bad pull where I have to lock<br/>
down 3 (or 4) I will use charm and pixie together<br/>
<br/>
Charm:  Sick on spare<br/>
Mez spare 3<br/>
Mez spare 4<br/>
<br/>
works pretty well.  I&#39;m only 45 though so I can&#39;t swear it will work up into<br/>
the 50&#39;s.  Works ok at 45 though<br/>

&gt; I think I&#39;ve used Pixie Strike all of once due to the feedback given<br/>
&gt; from this list.  I die enough as it is, I&#39;m not particulary open to<br/>
&gt; testing something out under fire that I&#39;m almost certain is gonna<br/>
&gt; fail. :)  Lullaby, I use to powerlevel my girlfriend&#39;s twink and<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s about it.  And I don&#39;t imagine that working so well when she<br/>
&gt; gets to around 30 or so...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I almost exclusively use charm to do crowd control.  If I&#39;m the main<br/>
&gt; crowd controller (i.e. no enchanter) I can usually effectively handle<br/>
&gt; a 3 pull... put your pet on the 3rd mob and they&#39;ll beat each other<br/>
&gt; up for awhile... But, you need a cleric to keep you alive with 2 mobs<br/>
&gt; beating on you during resists or mis-timed recharms.  I&#39;ve been in a<br/>
&gt; few parties where the paladin would taunt the 2nd, move out of range<br/>
&gt; and root it... Frustrated me trying to get my pet to attack while he<br/>
&gt; was rooted, but a pretty effective method nonetheless.  If there&#39;s 4<br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t think the group can handle at least 2 beating down the<br/>
&gt; tanks at once, then it&#39;s time to call ZONE before you even get into<br/>
&gt; the fight.  Hell, have the puller zone it off the bat. :)  I plan<br/>
&gt; excursions to Sebilis/Chardok, etc. around a cleric and/or enchanter<br/>
&gt; (no way I&#39;m going anywhere tough without at least one), so it&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; pick up groups I have to worry about.  Karnor&#39;s is the prime spot for<br/>
&gt; pickup groups on my server and luckily, the zone is close to most of<br/>
&gt; the camp spots. :)<br/>
