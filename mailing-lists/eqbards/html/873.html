&gt;Wow man. Do you teach High School History in California!? You sound like my<br/>
&gt;old teacher! (He was a cool guy, so dont take it the wrong way)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nah, but an old college professor of mine said he &quot;lived&quot; in those times,<br/>
and even translated texts and edited the major literary anthologies for the<br/>
period.  Still think I have all my notes somewhere, the guy knew<br/>
everything.  Even tried teaching us Old English a little, was amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember all his lectures on pre-medieval/medieval weaponry, was like<br/>
he was discussing a computer game, heheh.<br/>
