&gt;have cats eye amulet - better stat than cha +5?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Silver Cat&#39;s Eye Amulet is only +3 CHA, and can easily be made by most<br/>
jewelers.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have heard that you can buy a silk shirt and I sure would like one!  Can<br/>
&gt;anyone tell me where? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Silk Evening Tunic can be found in Qeynos. I can&#39;t remember the name of<br/>
the merchant, but it is a woman, and she&#39;s just outside the Lion&#39;s Mane<br/>
Inn, under a tent, near a couple of other merchants. The tunic looks just<br/>
like a cloth tunic in her booth, so be sure to look carefully at them.<br/>
