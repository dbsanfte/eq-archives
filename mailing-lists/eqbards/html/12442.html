<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443991308">Powerleveling anyone can be easily done with a higher (lvl 24 spells I<br/>
think) druid. They just buff you up some, especially getting their<br/>
damage shield, then heal you while you fight reds.  My friend shot up<br/>
his guildmate from 8-12 in a few hours...<br/>
<br/>
I witness the last hour of power leveing as I hopped on with my cleric<br/>
and helped with the healing... (so its at least partially verified, and<br/>
the guy is pretty reliable)<br/>
