&gt; I find this uninformed. We are perhaps the most versatile class in the<br/>
&gt; game. People that can find nothing but faults in their class make me<br/>
&gt; think one thought - you are playing the wrong class. We have so many<br/>
&gt; ways at our disposal to do almost anything, it&#39;s truely terrifying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dodge is capped at 125 for a reason - a bard is not a tank. This is also<br/>
&gt; why we don&#39;t get bash, parry, or double attack. When dodge caps at L24<br/>
&gt; you already should have begun occupying roles in your party other than<br/>
&gt; tank. Just look at how a bard solo&#39;s in the 40+ range to see how true<br/>
&gt; this is. Do you tank a blue or higher monster to kill it? of course not.<br/>
&gt; You use charm or chains and fear as two possible options.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, even if you are not the tank, songs move you up on the agro list<br/>
*every* time they pulse.<br/>
So, not a tank, just a punching bag.  With no way of defending ourselves.<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m only 20th, but i&#39;ve observed this quite a bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you aren&#39;t able to effective employ Lullaby, or it seems ineffectual,<br/>
&gt; ask constructively how others use it in this forum. Personally when I<br/>
&gt; solo, if there is any chance I&#39;ll fight a caster, Lullaby is memm&#39;d. It<br/>
&gt; may very well be mem&#39;d while I am grouped as well. There is nothing like<br/>
&gt; repeatedly interrupting a jin frogluk shaman attempting to cast heal to<br/>
&gt; make your group immediately value your presence.<br/>
umm...how about :<br/>
mob nods, mob smacks the crap out of you.<br/>
mob nods, mob stuns you.<br/>
start lullaby<br/>
mob nods, mob smacks the crap out of you.<br/>
<br/>
While fighting, solo, either melee or caster, in the Karanas and Lake Rathe<br/>
area, at level 19th, and 20th, I NEVER saw a mob interrupted in the least by<br/>
this song.  How can I ask a constructive question about how I might better<br/>
use it when it does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING except make me superagro to the mob?<br/>
This song is so completely useless at 20th, that I have unmemmed it.  It<br/>
only get&#39;s me killed, does not interrupt either melee or casters.  The song,<br/>
IMO, is COMPLETELY BROKEN now.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Pixie chase not useful?<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve watched a bard hold a bok ghoul knight in place for 2 minutes while<br/>
&gt; the other 5 in the group fought and killed a second bok and the ghoul<br/>
&gt; lord. Many of our songs at the level we get them are very weak, but<br/>
&gt; unlike most classes, whose spells have damage caps, our songs continue<br/>
&gt; to increase in power without limit. A L50 Bard is truely one of the most<br/>
&gt; formidable and broad-spectrumed options to play.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t know - been playing since day two of release, and am still only<br/>
20th level.  I guess I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t try to powerlevel up, so I could<br/>
have actually used some of the songs before they nerfed them to uselessness.<br/>
Of course, they seem to have fixed others, so maybe I still have something<br/>
to look forward to.<br/>

&gt; P.S. The ill-effect on bards produced by levitation was reported as a<br/>
&gt; bug, it will be corrected next patch.<br/>
