the threat of death hanging over you.  All the overcrowding<br/>
and camping IMHO made for really sloppy play.  If things had<br/>
never gotten that bad, you would only see Ykeshas and such in<br/>
the hands of people who knew what they were doing (or knew<br/>
someone who knew what they were doing).  Mistmoore is a lot<br/>
like that - buggy enough to be deadly if you were stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, here&#39;s a tip with Pixie Strike.  Once you target a<br/>
mob and start a targeted song, you don&#39;t have to keep it<br/>
targeted.  You can switch to a different target, attack,<br/>
etc. and the Pixie Strike will still hit the mob you had<br/>
targeted when you started the song.<br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;ll usually do if I&#39;m doing both crowd and runner<br/>
control is Strike, but retarget the mob everyone else is<br/>
fighting and monitor it&#39;s hp bar.  When it gets near the point<br/>
where it&#39;d start to run, I switch to a PS/Chain cycle.<br/>
<br/>
- Pixie Strike<br/>
- wait for the nods message (so I still have it targeted if<br/>
it&#39;s resisted, since it fails way more than Chain)<br/>
- target the mob that will run<br/>
- start Chain<br/>
- immediately switch back to the mob I&#39;m PSing<br/>
<br/>
repeat<br/>
<br/>
Several classes also have quick-casting stun spells which can<br/>
be used to stop runners.  These can usually give you enough<br/>
time to get a Chain or root cast.<br/>
