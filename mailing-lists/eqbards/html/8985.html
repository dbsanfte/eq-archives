<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792757621">An example of bard hate, last night in Lower Guk our party is fighting a <br/>
frog shamen.  I am NOT engaged in melee, but sitting back and playing only <br/>
Clarity (aka Mana song).  The Shaman, not once, not twice, but THREE times <br/>
attempts to cast Tagar&#39;s Insects on me (melee speed debuff).  Very silly <br/>
AI:p  I have also had the same thing happen numerous times in High Hold <br/>
Pass.  Where I will stop to watch someone fight a Gnoll Shamen (in case they <br/>
need help) and the Shamen turns and casts on me! I have never attacked it or <br/>
assisted the person attacking it, go figure.<br/>

&gt;I have been hearing rumors that &quot;bard hate&quot; does not really exist... Anyone <br/>
&gt;actually have proof that it does? </span></blockquote></div>
