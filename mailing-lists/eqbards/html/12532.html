<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Bah taking it to personal. All I&#39;m saying is that you said yourself vox<br/>
&gt;&gt; killled the raiders. I&#39;ve seen dragosn done two ways, the dragon gets<br/>
&gt;&gt; spawked or the raiders get spanked doesn&#39;t seem to be a medium.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Did I say that?  My mistake... Oh wait, I just read all my sent mail.<br/>
&gt;  I never said that people died.  Oops, your mistake.  My guess is<br/>
&gt;  90% of the people made it out alive.  The people who were slain<br/>
&gt;  were the pet masters who were a little too careless.  If we fought<br/>
&gt;  the dragon and lost, that one thing.  I&#39;m not ashamed to say we<br/>
&gt;  got spanked, but no one f&#39;ing fought the dragon dude, heh.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  the point you seem to miss.  Had the dominate server guild not<br/>
&gt;  stormed in and taken over, the 90% of the people alive would have<br/>
&gt;  regrouped and beat up Vox.<br/>
