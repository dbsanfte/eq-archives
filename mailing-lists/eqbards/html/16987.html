effect has been applied, it just sends the client a message<br/>
saying &quot;apply this debuff, duration is 18 seconds (or<br/>
whatever).&quot;  If there&#39;s any server-side lag after this<br/>
message, the client&#39;s 18 seconds can be over before the<br/>
server&#39;s 18 seconds are, and the server will apply the effect<br/>
after the icon is gone from the client.<br/>

Some effects (like Accelerando) are client side, so aren&#39;t<br/>
affected by this.<br/>
