I buy every song for the same reason I buy every wep. I wanna have em.  Some<br/>
don&#39;t work, granted but they will eventually fix them. Some you don&#39;t have a<br/>
use for right this minute but who knows.  Like there I was in the Sol Ro<br/>
temple, getting ready to do a Lambent quest, ok I got 2 runes and they both<br/>
say &quot;one-eye&quot; but nuthin else. Which one is Froon and which one is Choon? So<br/>
I used the Lyssia Catalog song (ya, the one that is so-called useless) and<br/>
Nadare has to rib me because I was reluctant to buy it when I was young and<br/>
14pp seemed a treasure.  Some day you maybe somewhere and not have it and<br/>
them what?   Like you don&#39;t have a use for stamina song - fine - you are a<br/>
solo bard right now.  Wait til you are party bard and your war&#39;s are<br/>
swinging their BBC&#39;s  and getting slower and slower and slower.  &quot;Excuse me<br/>
group, I will selos to freeport and buy that song - I hope the boat is<br/>
running today - brb.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two things - my so-called grammar is what it is &quot;mine&quot; hehe and I already<br/>
been yelled (to no avail) but that was a typo - should have said &quot;better for<br/>
you...&quot; Songs get better with age and when brand new are weaker that how<br/>
they work even 2 levels later. Also, at 8 you don&#39;t might the bandits or<br/>
orcs - maybe some grouped gnolls.  In you teens, you will fight at bandit,<br/>
raider, orc and derv camps where you will want to do selective pulls. So<br/>
maybe not all that great right now - but it will get better for you.  You<br/>
will use it more and more.<br/>
<br/>
Some loot is similar.  Rustys and such - plus coin. By 15 to 20, you can get<br/>
snake skin armor off the captains, commanders and nobles. Paw is empty<br/>
because it is too far away for beginning dungeon hunters who die too often.<br/>
BB for loot - WK for xp - that was our motto.<br/>
<br/>
Snake Fang necklace (that was me) - DOES NOT cure poison - it add sv poison<br/>
+2 (resistence - not cure) I think.  Get Snakskin tunic and gloves if you<br/>
can and Snakefang necklace to wear while fighting poisonous mobs.  Prolly u<br/>
can buy a potion in Rivervale that is cure poison.  Maybe a cleric quest<br/>
too? Cant remember if you get a potion or just a cure cast on you. <br/>
<br/>
Lament is pre-pull crowd control and a different tool than the post pull<br/>
ones like lullaby, charm and mez.  Lament will not add you to hate list<br/>
unless it is resisted.  Yes it does wear off and then the mob is agro again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, we are happy to answer your questions - I think it helps us re-think<br/>
things that help us do better - even if they are basic.  <br/>
