&gt;rhetorical debate; or perhaps the comment that people are exaggerating too<br/>
&gt;much.  Keep in mind that  - like analogies exaggerating the opposite of what<br/>
&gt;you are arguing is also a rhetorical device.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well it started out by someone saying dirge was useless due to recast time and<br/>
resists.  i said what resist problem, i never have any, and it is useful in some<br/>
situations including pvp.  then someone said pvp people don&#39;t matter because<br/>
they are an insignificant minority, to which i pointed out that of all the people who<br/>
play everquest, there are MORE pvp players than there are bards, and that it was<br/>
very easy to dismiss a minority as insignificant when you were not in that minority.<br/>
<br/>
then it kind of morphed into whether bards were overpowered or not and whether or<br/>
not you can factor in difficulty of play into balancing class power or not.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t mean this as a flame to Whee, (by singling him out); but the<br/>

&gt;be that the thread is Whee one side and everyone else (who participating in<br/>
&gt;the thread) on the other.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually blitz i believe agrees with me on the difficulty of play thing, and that bards<br/>
are not underpowered, altho i think he thinks they are balanced, while i think we are<br/>
overpowered.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1) DDD - are you saying that this IS a useful song?  That 99 pct of the<br/>
&gt;Bards are wrong - that it is VERY useful; or simply that it is very slightly<br/>
&gt;useful and we are &quot;ridiculously exaggerating&quot; by saying something is<br/>
&gt;&quot;completely&quot; useless instead of &quot;very marginally&quot; useless.  Not MUCH of an<br/>
&gt;exaggeration there if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>out of that 99 percent, how many have actually thought about good ways to use<br/>
the song and how many are simply agreeing with someone who told them at one<br/>
time &#39;&#39;this song is useless&#39;&#39;.  i pointed out 2 good ways to get quite a bit of damage<br/>
out of this song (one of which was in an enchanter group, where many people think<br/>
they are useless).  the song has been compared to harm touch, and i think it compares<br/>
favorably to harmtouch with respect to damage/refresh time.  i don&#39;t see anyone saying<br/>
harmtouch is useless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) The PvP thing was argued a bit - but someone pointed out how Verant has<br/>
&gt;made it very clear they claim they are specifically tuning this song to<br/>
&gt;balance bards across the board.  There has been no indication that this is a<br/>
&gt;PVP.  While it could be a &quot;stealth component&quot; of the tuning a) I doubt it<br/>
&gt;and b) it&#39;s not taking the issue at face value especially considering the<br/>
&gt;whole &quot;Class Balance&quot; threads<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>most of the argument about pvp centered around whether or not a minority<br/>
of customers could be arbitrarily considered insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3) Bards are over powered.  You haven&#39;t really spent much time arguing<br/>
&gt;that - and I&#39;m not quite clear on your argument for that.   Perhaps it is<br/>
&gt;due to soloing ability.  I despise soloing and never do it.  Personally - if<br/>
&gt;you were to judge EQ as a solo game; it is VERY poor.  Any single-player RPG<br/>
&gt;game rings around EQ as a single-player game.  If I felt like single-player<br/>
&gt;gaming I&#39;d play BG2.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i almost never solo.  i mean we are over powered with respect to other classes in a group<br/>
setting, more so in broken groups than cle/enc/war groups, but the fact that we can<br/>
make a group without a cleric, enchanter, OR warrior able to go deep into sebilis or<br/>
howling stones or karnors seems pretty powerful to me.</div>
