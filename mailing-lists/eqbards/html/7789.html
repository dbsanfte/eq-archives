<div id="ygrps-yiv-210892859">That&#39;s got to be the stupidest exploit I have ever heard.  I seriously hope<br/>
you were being sarcastic John.  I wonder, if a guard will attack you if you<br/>
attack a player, since you are a player, will attacking yourself cause him<br/>
to kill you?<br/>

Heh.  This is a great idea.  Next time you&#39;re doing a<br/>
Freeport/Qeynos/Freeport or Freeport/Kelethin/Freeport run,<br/>
put all your stuff in the bank (now that no-drops will go in),<br/>
and kill yourself.<br/>
