<div id="ygrps-yiv-461924131"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;1) I like the process being somewhat manual. Typing each line does a few<br/>
&gt;things: it helps to simulate some of the difficulties of live<br/>
&gt;performance (typos as missed notes) and keeps every kewldood and their<br/>
&gt;brother from spamming us with Marilyn Manson lyrics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree completely.  If we had any kind of scripting command, it would<br/>
be SO abused, it wouldn&#39;t be funny.  This is something that would have<br/>
to be VERY limited.  I come from a BBS / Mud background as well, one<br/>
thing I have seen people do to limit this is enforce a delay between<br/>
lines.  (ie: No matter how fast you type, (or how well you script) you<br/>
cannot send more than one line every 5-10 seconds.  A good start, but<br/>
not enough, IMHO.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) If we&#39;re going to solicit a command from Verant, we need to do<br/>
&gt;something that benefits more than just a niche of bards. My proposal<br/>
&gt;(which I feedback nearly daily now) is that a new chat command box<br/>
&gt;be added to the chat command window (where you select languages<br/>
&gt;and such). This new command would be an emote verb, and would work<br/>
&gt;kind of like the /tell does there now. Here&#39;s how it works: in the<br/>
&gt;box you would type a verb (sings, mutters, whispers, muses, etc...)<br/>
&gt;and then, you could check a box next to it to turn it on. Then, when<br/>
&gt;using normal speech, rather than &#39;says&#39; you would see the verb you<br/>
&gt;entered.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like this idea.  It&#39;s not very abusable (a few ways, but nothing worse<br/>
than what we have now) and it benifits more than just performers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As far as the script idea goes, it bears some consideration. Coming<br/>
&gt;from a MUD background I found myself almost debilitated by the lack<br/>
&gt;of a good macro or scripting system. ( I used to have no less than<br/>
&gt;100 emotes queued up to keyboard shortcuts to help with RPing my<br/>
&gt;characters. Just call me the PuppetMaster.) But like I said earlier,<br/>
&gt;for barding, I really like the manual input.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like the manual imput for a few reasons.  But mostly for the<br/>
atmosphere.  It doesn&#39;t seem very personal when someone just spams out a<br/>
song 10 lines at a time.  I&#39;ve always loved the time it takes to type<br/>
out each line.. it adds suspence to the story.. (or song).<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if something like this is instituted.. performing a song would<br/>
take no time at all..you hit your /script macro, and then you&#39;re done..<br/>
5 seconds.. consider this announcement..<br/>
<br/>
Soerbaird Concert, this sunday!<br/>
Starts: 5pm<br/>
there will be 9 singers!<br/>
After the concert we will meet at an inn for drinks!<br/>
(Figure 5:15 at the latest)<br/>
Be there!<br/>
<br/>
It just doesn&#39;t seem as real.  A good decent length song (with a fast<br/>
typist) takes about as long to type as it does to sing in RL (once you<br/>
figure in pauses for musical solos and such).. a five minute RL song<br/>
would take about that much time (give or take) to do in EQ.  I like<br/>
this, and a script command would just resort concerts to the following..<br/>
<br/>
*get&#39;s up on stage and greets crowd*<br/>
*types in /script &quot;Latest_Song_About_Drinking.TXT&quot;*<br/>
*Pauses for a moment or two to wait for crowd to finish reading*<br/>
*Takes a bow and announces next performer(<br/>
<br/>
It just seems so impersonal.  *shrugs* just my opinion, take it as you<br/>
will, I&#39;ve rambled enough.<br/>
<br/>
(Coincidentally, for those that didn&#39;t know, a colon &quot;:&quot; works just as<br/>
well as &quot;/em &quot; and is a little quicker to type.. example:<br/>
<br/>
/em sings, &#39;All I need in Life is a Beer!&#39;<br/>
and<br/>
:sings, &#39;All I need in Life is a Beer!&#39;<br/>
Would both come out the same:<br/>
Lokar sings, &#39;All I need in life is a Beer!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d throw that in there.. heh.. Have fun!)<br/>
