<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873894049">When Verant does a 180 on a position that was once supposedly &quot;carved in<br/>
stone&quot; - you gotta bet that there is a great deal of demand from the<br/>
customer base motivating them. Or maybe just a new, &quot;kinder, gentler&quot;<br/>
management team - who knows!<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think it is a great idea.  I have 4 accounts and 2 PC&#39;s.  If I<br/>
am not driving 2 char&#39;s, I actually feel like something is missing and I do<br/>
spend most of my time in 6 person groups doing exp or events.  At times, I<br/>
have really wished that  certain characters were on other accounts for ease<br/>
of teleporting. My &quot;mains&quot; are 60 Bard, 60 Cleric, 52 Enchanter, and  51<br/>
Wizard.  The wizard account happens to have a rogue that I would like to<br/>
level up sometime in the near future and teleports are obviously not as<br/>
convenient as they could be. So this is a good thing for me.  Btw, I am<br/>
actually thinking of getting a 3rd PC - probably not for playing 3 at the<br/>
same time - except for teleporting and maybe powerleveling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as unsavory characters inflicting pain and suffering on unsuspecting<br/>
groups, we already have plenty of that.  It&#39;s called &quot;A normal day in<br/>
Sebilis.&quot;  If they transfer to a new server, they should be pretty easy to<br/>
spot.  They will be wearing that new kind of armor: Emperor Armor*<br/>

I&#39;m not sure if it is funny or sad.  I do hope we don&#39;t suddenly see a bunch<br/>
of characters who couldn&#39;t get in a group on their old server due to their<br/>
unsavory ways suddenly dropped on unsuspecting high level groups elsewhere.<br/>
