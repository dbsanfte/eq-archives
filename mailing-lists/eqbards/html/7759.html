&gt; &gt; 3.  The really destabilizing part of this is not Bind Affinity in and of<br/>

&gt; While this may sound nice in theory, I have been grouping with many,<br/>

Screech and stand next to the casters until they all manage to<br/>
gate.  Heck, I&#39;ve even stood next to one long enough for her<br/>
to memorize gate, then cast it.  We&#39;ve discussed the several<br/>
multi-death dungeon crawls that our guild has been involved<br/>
in, and we could&#39;ve escaped almost all of them with only one<br/>
death if we&#39;d played our cards right.  (Usually my death, but<br/>
hey that&#39;s part of playing the character with the get out of <br/>
death free card.)  The hours of experience the casters would<br/>
lose due to death simply do not outweigh the extra time I have<br/>
to spend running from town if I should die.<br/>
