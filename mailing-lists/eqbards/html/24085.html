&gt;can come up with is when the group is moving someplace and everyone is<br/>
&gt;invisible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the problem. Everyone else is talking about all the other <br/>
situations that they are in that they finding this useful. If this is the <br/>
only situation where it is useful to you, that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
But other people are of a different race, have different equipment and are <br/>
involved in different groups (or are soloing) than you&#39;re own.<br/>
<br/>
Respect of other&#39;s opinions will win more respect than name calling.<br/>
