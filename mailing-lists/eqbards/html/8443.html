play a caster that I would be mad if you weren&#39;t playing the mana regen song<br/>
in between fights.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Well, a guildmate of mine stated today that he is now able to<br/>
&gt;&gt; heal 45 points<br/>
&gt;&gt; per tick with his Lute of the Gypsy Princess found in<br/>
&gt;&gt; Mistmoore.<br/>
&gt;--snip--<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I dunno about that, seems unlikely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a rather heated debate online over the weekend with some arrogant<br/>
&gt;player on E&#39;ci (forget the name because I was too flamed) who started the<br/>
&gt;&quot;debate&quot; by sending me a private tell that I was the worst bard to ever<br/>
 </span></blockquote>play<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the game because I was not singing Jaxon&#39;s Jig between fights to increase<br/>
&gt;manna regen.  He then got my group started in on it (I was the group<br/>
 </span></blockquote>leader)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and everyone was against me claiming I should sing the song and that it<br/>
&gt;works especially well for manna regen when using the Mistmoore drum (which<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;do not have by the way).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I tried to explain the myth to them but no one wanted to hear about it and<br/>
&gt;this guy just kept saying he &quot;hates to see someone play the character class<br/>
&gt;so poorly&quot;.  Well I got totally ticked off and lost my temper and started<br/>
&gt;cussing like crazy at him (in private tell) to which he responded he would<br/>
&gt;get his bard character and meet me and kick my A** all over highkeep, to<br/>
&gt;which I brilliantly responded &quot;kiss my a** you stupid fu**er&quot; (I know, real<br/>
&gt;intelligent).  He said he was going to tell two of my party members<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(friends<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of his) to leave my group so I decided forget this (was now shaking in rage<br/>
&gt;and very insulted by this guy) so I disbanded my group, apologized to the<br/>
&gt;nice people in it, and logged out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish I could remember this guy&#39;s name so I could post it here but as I<br/>
&gt;said I was seeing red at the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My point is that there are tons of lies and falsehoods about our abilities<br/>
&gt;that trolls and generally uninformed people love to spread for some reason<br/>
&gt;or another.<br/>
