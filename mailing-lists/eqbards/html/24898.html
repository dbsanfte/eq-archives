<div id="ygrps-yiv-783807640">So basically it&#39;s really not worth all the time and effort, unless you&#39;re<br/>
getting good exp from all the goblins.  Seems like for something THAT hard<br/>
it&#39;d be a better ring.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me or do most of the quests here kinda stink?  You&#39;d think<br/>
they&#39;d make the exp gained a bit more..I mean, they&#39;re quests after<br/>
all..not just running outside and beating somethings head in.<br/>

gain by killing Goblins, Mooto and Deathfist Orcs; and by turning belts in<br/>
to Deputy Budo, and goblin warbeads in to Sheriff Roglio.  My Halfling<br/>
Druid (who STARTED amiable) took weeks to complete it.  Talies, on the<br/>
other hand, has a looong way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the ring is a one-shot Healing (100 hp), so really it&#39;s an<br/>
emergency-only toy for lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
The ring can be &quot;recharged&quot; by giving it to Hendi Mrubble in the Cleric&#39;s<br/>
Guild in Rivervale, but you have to have even MORE ungodly faction to do<br/>
that.<br/>
