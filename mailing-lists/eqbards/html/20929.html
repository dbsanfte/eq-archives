<div id="ygrps-yiv-755721627">Ok, if someone wants to reply to him, just point out how many times they<br/>
&quot;fixed&quot; the druid/ranger/ebony bladed sword root with damage spell and how<br/>
they swore up and down that it was fixed each time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The root does damage and breaks the root as soon as it is cast&quot;<br/>
&quot;We fixed it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This went on for 2-3 passes of looking at that spell. They don&#39;t have a good<br/>
track record of properly recognizing the problems we point out as players<br/>
are real.<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t been under a rock. (although it may have been safer there, maybe<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; should try it) I&#39;ve seen and contributed to many of the posts. But when I<br/>
&gt; read Abashi&#39;s reply, I honestly believe he has absolutely no idea what we<br/>
&gt; are talking about when we reference the problems with chains and lullaby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quote:<br/>
&gt; ------<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m not sure what is supposed to be wrong with chains. Some changes were<br/>
&gt; put in to put in a maximum amount that a creature could be slowed prior to<br/>
&gt; applying any slowing related to damage. The change was intentional.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for lullaby, I just said in another thread that Ester, the one who was<br/>
&gt; going to look at this, is on vacation, and I&#39;ll have to check with her<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; she gets back. Now that I think of it, I think I may remember someone<br/>
&gt; stating that lullaby&#39;s current functionality is intended, as it&#39;s the only<br/>
&gt; thing to keep them from trivializing encounters. I&#39;ll have to check with<br/>
&gt; Ester when she gets back to be sure.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like you, I refuse to believe they are outright lying, so I come to the<br/>
&gt; conclusion that he has no clue. He remembers the patch that nerfed chains,<br/>
&gt; but he doesn&#39;t know how it affected the lower level song. Again with<br/>
&gt; lullaby, he remembers the last time it was looked at, but doesn&#39;t know<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; we still see a HUGE problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;m hopelessly optimistic and refuse to see the truth that is<br/>
evident,<br/>
&gt; but I just can&#39;t imagine that he knows and is covering it up. Instead I<br/>
&gt; think that he is hopelessly swamped by email, message board postings and<br/>
&gt; whatever other work he may have and in that mountain of information, ours<br/>
&gt; got pushed to the bottom and  never seen.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I generally try to be open-minded, but...<br/>
&gt; I agree with you on the experience parts of your post, not a big deal, and<br/>
&gt; its not going to change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the song related parts of your post though, have you been living under<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; rock for the last 6 months?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There have been numerous postings to the EQ boards, emails directly to GZ<br/>
&gt; and Abashi, posts on the EQ_Caster&#39;s Board (which they do read), as well<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; messages sent thru Baelish (runs EQ_Casters, talks to GZ nearly daily).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many of these posts have contained ridiculously detailed information on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; problems with the broken songs.  John Kim and myself have broken the<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; down statistically to the point where it was readily apparent that the<br/>
&gt; resist rates were down to tenths of a percent with variances of +/- 2<br/>
tenths<br/>
&gt; of a percent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is ABSOLUTELY no way they can claim they don&#39;t know what we think is<br/>
&gt; wrong with these songs and still be truthful.  They ARE ignoring us.<br/>
&gt; (Harmonic is gone right?  If not, my apologies Harm)<br/>
&gt; Well maybe they aren&#39;t ignoring us, but in that case they are purposely<br/>
&gt; lying to us instead.  I prefer to assume the former.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) They aren&#39;t ignoring us. Instead they just have no idea that we think<br/>
&gt; there is a problem that needs to be looked at. Abashi is a busy man, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that he missed our<br/>
&gt; posts or forgot them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) If we can make them aware of what we think is wrong, then we can get<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; to look at it and there is a possibility that we can get it fixed. This to<br/>
&gt; me is good news. The only problem is how to get our thoughts looked at. I<br/>
&gt; suggest we write up a concise description of the problems. (insane resist<br/>
&gt; rates on pixie strike and lullaby and ineffectiveness of snare since the<br/>
&gt; patch) then we post it to the bug board and the gameplay board, as well as<br/>
&gt; emailing it to abashi.<br/>
