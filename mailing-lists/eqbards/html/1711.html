&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not many are, I think!<br/>
<br/>
The aqua goblins will con blue to a level 16 bard, perfect place to go with<br/>
one or two friends, or even more, when the bard gets the song.  The aqua<br/>
goblins have claimed a structure in the bottom of the lake, similar to<br/>
towers with the ladders in places like Misty.  Easiest way to find it is go<br/>
to the fisherman and their shacks (the fellows with halberds), dive in from<br/>
there and head straight out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of the shipwreck, and plan to visit that, thanks for the<br/>
directions!<br/>

&gt;Another place worth investigating is the shipwreck off Wisp<br/>
&gt;Isle in Erudin&#39;s Crossing.  There is a sharp dropoff behind<br/>
&gt;the wreck.  My friend and I went down the dropoff.  I stopped<br/>
&gt;because I lost sight of him but he went a bit further and<br/>
&gt;swears he saw a fish or mermaid down there.  I plan to explore<br/>
&gt;it more fully in the future.<br/>
