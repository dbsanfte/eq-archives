<div id="ygrps-yiv-296325577">I can&#39;t speak for the original post&#39;er - but for me, PL (and hence lag)<br/>
seems to have gotten much worse.  When PL is bad - I notice Selo&#39;s dropping<br/>
off.  Sometimes I just slow down - occasionally even canceling! (I have to<br/>
re-click the spell icon)..  This could VERY well be the problem.  If Selo&#39;s<br/>
is affected you can assume other spells may be affected n unpredictable ways<br/>
as well...<br/>
<br/>
Keep and eye on the lag-o-meter.  If that&#39;s not the problem - try /bug (not<br/>
sure how much they REALLY pay attention to that though...)<br/>

&gt; I have not seen anything like this. I can still keep up my 3 song rotation<br/>
