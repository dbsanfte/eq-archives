<div id="ygrps-yiv-281355466">I had the misfortune to get killed by Murissa Sandwhisper the other day.  I<br/>
was not aware that she would attack someone unprovoked.  I was in North Ro<br/>
on my way back to Freeport.  I saw her as I was approaching but just assumed<br/>
she was another NPC merchant.  I had some stuff to sell so moved towards<br/>
her.  Next thing I know, whack, whack, I&#39;m dead.  As I went back to retrieve<br/>
my corpse I noticed four other corpses in her vicinity.  She was standing<br/>
right next to my corpse.  I sang the Carillon song and hotkeyed the /corpse<br/>
command.  Her attitude towards me changed to threatening. I inched closer<br/>
and was able to safely pull my corpse away from her.<br/>
<br/>
I now know to avoid her.  However, one day I will get my revenge.  Does<br/>
anyone know if she is part of a quest?  Also, when I do get my revenge, is<br/>
there a major faction hit with anyone in Freeport?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
