<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990336626">I was kicking around the idea for reducing overcrowding and I came up with a simple idea, take the most crowed zones e.g.. Oasis, solB, etc.... and duplicate them when you zone into the zone the computer checks how many ppl are in it if the number is greater then say 35 you would be sent to a separate zone that was the exact same except for the ppl in it. the zone you went into would be random. the only catch would be groups would all have to group before hand and then would all wind up in the same place also a tag for ppl recovering their body so they could get back to the right version of the zone.  To prevent farming of named mobs the additional zones would only open when the last one was full.So a level 50 necro could not log in off peak and get 5 to 10 of the same items by repeatedly zoning into different versions of the same zone.<br/>
This would be easier and cheaper then adding servers and would allow us to remain on the server we are on now :-)<br/>

  Simple solution to this, given a day to think about it I could come up<br/>
  with 5 better ways (and thus have a variety of ways for different<br/>
  dungeons).<br/>
