Subject: Re: [eqbards] Re: DDD worthless? How would you change it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the problem is, i think these are bogus reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Takes too much mana, so I can&#39;t charm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is valid if you are charming.  it seems like most bards don&#39;t charm in<br/>
groups with<br/>
an enchanter, so that makes this only valid in non enchanter groups.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Takes too much mana, so the recast is way too long.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>recast is not an issue since you can swap it out whenever you don&#39;t have<br/>
enough<br/>
mana to cast it and swap it back in when you do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;The damage it does is pitiful, especially when you look at the mob <br/>
&gt;scaling between 50 and 60.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it may be pitiful, but so is bard melee.  does that mean you don&#39;t melee at<br/>
all?<br/>
it may not be the be all end all of all damage songs or spells, but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
that there is no place for it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;It&#39;s AE, and I&#39;d NEVER use an AE song.. The Chanter would kill me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is just so wrong on so many levels that it would take a whole other<br/>
post to address<br/>
this.  for the sake of brevity, i&#39;ll just point to my earlier posts where i<br/>
pointed out when an<br/>
excellent time to use this song was, which wouldn&#39;t mess up the enchanter at<br/>
all and would<br/>
do a significant amount of damage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So, my question is... &quot;What would have to change in order to justify <br/>
&gt;memming this song?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not talking about it turning into the primary song every Bard <br/>
&gt;plays from 43 to 60.  I&#39;m talking about it becoming useful.. <br/>
&gt;occasionally, every once in awhile, rarely... something more than NOT <br/>
&gt;EVER.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sorry, maybe i misinterpreted your 90% statement then, my bad.  i originally<br/>
thought you <br/>
meant that 90% of the time, bards would be using it.  but maybe you meant<br/>
that 90% of<br/>
the bards would use it once in a while.  in that case, i think it has it&#39;s<br/>
uses once in a while<br/>
if you use it correctly.<br/>
