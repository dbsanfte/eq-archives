<br/>
As I understand it Fufill&#39;s does 2 things - DoT (degrades hp) and lowers MR.<br/>
I was misinformed about the drum ehancement working (an old song sheet said<br/>
it did and gave data points.)  The part that degrades the hp would be the<br/>
part that might not stack or cancel another caster&#39;s spell - like darkness<br/>
which is a 2 part spell - I do believe DoT and slows them.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is easy enough to find out what the effects are...<br/>
<br/>
Ok, just tested: cast on self hp dropped from 786 to 765 and dropped MR from<br/>
51 to 41.  No enhancement with a drum equipped.  So thats 21 dmg on an even<br/>
con.<br/>
<br/>
Bellow on blue mobs is hitting at a max of 18. Less on higher cons.<br/>
<br/>
The MR seemed to recover on the second pulse. It was recovered before the<br/>
red color on the hp cleared and while hp was still degrading.<br/>
<br/>
So, this tells me that it&#39;s use to lower MR would need to be synchronized<br/>
with someone else casting on it. I was thinking that it would degrade the<br/>
mob&#39;s MR and have a recovery period like hp.  But it seems that the MR would<br/>
only maybe be degraded for the next pulse (tick?, round? ugh!) so the next<br/>
song after Fulfils would benefit from the MR degrade.  Which says that you&#39;d<br/>
want to weave it between each of the other target songs:<br/>
<br/>
Fufil&#39;s - sticks <br/>
(mr degrades)<br/>
Bellow (less chance of resist)  18 dmg<br/>
(mr recovers)<br/>
Chant or other party buff<br/>
(DoT is complete) 21 dmg<br/>
<br/>
FuFil&#39;s - sticks<br/>
(mr degrades)<br/>
Largos (less chance of resist)<br/>
(mr recovers)<br/>
Chant or other party buff<br/>
(DoT is complete) 21 dmg<br/>
<br/>
Fufil&#39;s - sticks<br/>
(mr degrades)<br/>
Chains (less chance of resist)<br/>
Chant or other party buff<br/>
(DoT is complete)  21 dmg<br/>

I really doubt that ANY spell would be effected adversely by curtailing <br/>
chant as it is a MR debuff.  The only time DoT&#39;s will not stack is when <br/>
DoT&#39;s of the same spell line are cast on the same target.<br/>
