Thanks for clearing that up so completely. Seems the legendary 3.5 song maximum has some factual<br/>
basis behind it. <br/>

RE Twisting 5 songs:<br/>
<br/>
Songs take 3 seconds to cast.<br/>
Songs last until the third pulse after they are cast.<br/>
A pulse occurs once every 6 seconds.<br/>
There is overhead between songs (songs have to ungray, you have to start the next song, it takes<br/>
sometime).<br/>
<br/>
Assume 1 second between songs:<br/>
<br/>
T-2 Song 1 starts<br/>
T0 Pulse 0<br/>
T1 Song 1 hits (1 up)<br/>
T2 Song 2 starts<br/>
T5 Song 2 hits (2 up)<br/>
T6 Pulse 1, Song 3 starts<br/>
T9 Song 3 hits (3 up)<br/>
T10 Song 4 starts<br/>
T12 Pulse 2<br/>
T13 Song 4 hits (4 up)<br/>
T14 Song 5 starts<br/>
T17 Song 5 hits (5 up)<br/>
T18 Pulse 3, Song 1 and 2 drop, Song 6 starts (3 up)<br/>
T21 Song 6 hits (4 up)<br/>
T22 Song 7 starts<br/>
T25 Song 7 hits (5 up)<br/>
T26 Pulse 4, Songs 3 and 4 drop (3 up)<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s possible to have 5 up at once for awhile. But it&#39;s NOT possible to have 5 up at once all<br/>
the time. Do the same thing with 0 time between songs, you&#39;ll go from 4 to 6, but you&#39;ll always<br/>
drop back to 4. And 0 time between songs is impossible. At some point between 0 and 1 second<br/>
overhead time, it becomes impossible to maintain 4. That assumes no missed notes.&nbsp; And<br/>
clearly, that fractional difference of less than a second may well be due to connection and<br/>
computer power, and have nothing to do with the competence of the player. <br/>
<br/>
The way to APPEAR to get 5 up all at once is to twist in the BoH. I don&#39;t know for sure, but I<br/>
suspect the Epic and the Siren&#39;s Song also blink when they proc, so they may make it SEEM as if<br/>
the Bard is singing 5. Charm and Mez last 4 pulses, Anglitsch&#39;s Assonance lasts 10, so they can be<br/>
used to bump things up. You can with proper ordering and timing of songs, and the right weapons,<br/>
have 8 effects up at once for about 1 second, then it comes tumbling down like a house of cards.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest that the only way another player would KNOW that a Bard was twisting 5 was if<br/>
the Bard was singing 5 buff songs, and I challenge you to come up with 5 useful non-conflicting<br/>
buff songs that are worth the work.<br/>

PS, I went to the BotB and I had trouble keeping 3 up. We beat a pretty good team in the first<br/>
round, too. Twisting 4-5 was only possible for me when I was sitting in one place.<br/>
<br/>
PPS, I&#39;ve been able to consistently maintain 3 songs (I know from checking logs) even in<br/>
conditions (such as NToV) where I was receiving text messages 15-30 seconds behind the event they<br/>
were referring too. This is possible because the outgoing information in EQ is about 1/10th the<br/>
size of the incoming, and the outgoing info is pretty much a steady stream, as opposed to the huge<br/>
bursts you get on incoming. So I would never rely on the screen timer. Nice and rhythmic, just<br/>
like a percussionist, is the way to do it.<br/>
