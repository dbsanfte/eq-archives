<div id="ygrps-yiv-807191623">At some point I swear I will post something on topic, but um, until then,<br/>
*weasely smile* is there an Enchanters mailing list or message board that is<br/>
the &quot;good one&quot; like this list is the &quot;good one&quot; for Bards? Lot&#39;s of places<br/>
to hear people talking *cough*complaining*cough* but places with a high<br/>
signal to noise ratio like this list are rare. Any pointers?<br/>

Tszaaz<br/>
<br/>
P.S. (ooh and on topic, er, kinda) I played Tszaaz (Bard 25) last night for<br/>
the first time in a looong time, wow it is easy to get very rusty at song<br/>
weaving. At any rate I was Erudes crossing on a mission to collect Kerra<br/>
Beetle eyes for a friend. It can be tough when people outnumber wisps but<br/>
overall it gets my vote as the nicest zone in the game for pleasant<br/>
comradery. It&#39;s like the Anti-HighPass-Orc-Side. And as was by far the<br/>
highest level person there (and causing trouble by killing beetles<br/>
occasionally causing Fire Elems and Madman to spawn) it was nice to be able<br/>
to respond to some overwhelmed youngster by just running up and singing<br/>
until sanity was restored.</div>
