<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281353627"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Quad attacks for 150-250 hurt.  A couple tanks died within<br/>
&gt; 3 seconds of getting him aggroed on them.  Combined with his<br/>
&gt; AE lifetap and buggy pathing, he was actually harder than<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk (who is widely regarded as the most difficult<br/>
&gt; god/dragon at the moment).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not much you can do about those Quad attacks.  Did the clerics give everyone<br/>
their best Poison resist?  And were all the bards there singing purifying<br/>
rhythms?  The Lifetap is a check against poison resist.  If you can crank it<br/>
high enough you can (almost) nullify it.   My friend who goes to hate pretty<br/>
regularly swears by &quot;NiV+Hymn+Purify&quot; or just &quot;NiV + Purify&quot; He hasn&#39;t gone<br/>
since the chant upgrades and says that the Rhythm series is better than the<br/>
Psalm for fighting the Maestro.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect a really good combination would be FCC+PR+CoC+NIV if you can get<br/>
four going.  Otherwise drop Fufil&#39;s for just PR, CoC, NiV.<br/>
<br/>
Just some helpful advice.  You&#39;re probably already doing that though ;)<br/>
