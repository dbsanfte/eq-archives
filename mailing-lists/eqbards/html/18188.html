&gt; i use it as an upgrade to chains.  with 4 effects i thought it would get<br/>
&gt; resisted a whole lot but it has been sticking regularly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a question for all of you on Kunark...<br/>
<br/>
Have all of you noticed that resist rates are very very low? I think I&#39;ve<br/>
had one single spell resisted in the 20ish hours I&#39;ve spent there so far.<br/>
Am I extremely lucky or is everyone finding similar results?<br/>
