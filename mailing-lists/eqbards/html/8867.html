&gt; Heh.  I was getting tired of Chain/Screeching griffennes to<br/>
&gt; get a charm (0 for 3 so far), and when I saw GrimFeather fly<br/>
&gt; by I briefly considered charming him to kill the fenne for<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>

better than to speed up their spawn rates by clearing some trash but don&#39;t know exactly who or<br/>
what to kill.  Beetles?  Griffawns?  Griffennes are annoyingly rare in such a large zone.<br/>
