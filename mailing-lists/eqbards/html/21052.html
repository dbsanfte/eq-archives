<b>Subject:</b> Clouding for group travel? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571248228">Now that I can play Clouding, I tried using it while travelling<br/>
through Firiona Vie with my Shaman husband.  He SoW&#39;d us, I played<br/>
clouding, he auto followed and off we went.  It didn&#39;t take long for<br/>
him to lose the effect of Clouding, as it seems it&#39;s range is shorter<br/>
than the auto follow range.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone bother to use Clouding for group travel?  Isn&#39;t it a pain<br/>
(other than in small spaces like dungeons) to have to use manual<br/>
follow to keep within range?<br/>
