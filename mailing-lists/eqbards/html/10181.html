<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My questions are these:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;* Is what I am doing wrong?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all. As long as you do not rip people off, and deal fair then it is <br/>
fine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;* Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. I did the sam thing in the first couple months of release. I was <br/>
making plat like crazy doing the Kelethin to Qeynos trade run at 6th level <br/>
(on a one week old server this is a VERY scary trip).  I could easly make <br/>
100 plat every 2 nights at 6th level :)  I used this money to finance the <br/>
smith in my guild, looking back I should have done the smithing as the <br/>
person deleted the character later on, grrrrrrr.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;* What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I am a twink?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This will be hard to do, especially on a established server.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;* Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this character.  And, I<br/>
&gt;   never thought twice about it until I was reading some recent posts. Will <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;   be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you get Lambent too early you will be wearing the same armor for a <br/>
loooooong time. It is really up to you.<br/>
