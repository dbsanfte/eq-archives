<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144405168">Again, this doesn&#39;t even fix that problem if that was the original intent.<br/>
Using one cast of normal levitate my druid can bounce up into that<br/>
crawlway/ventilation shaft without any exploits.  All they really had to do<br/>

&gt;  a long time ago about how to sneak into Vox&#39;s lair, when I <br/>
&gt;  first figured it out without using the surface geometry to<br/>
&gt;  &#39;scale&#39; a flat wall (as someone pointed out).  Uups.<br/>
