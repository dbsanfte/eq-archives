<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252205053">I&#39;ve been following this with some interest - and I&#39;m curious people&#39;s<br/>
opinions - and the actual truth of the matter.<br/>
<br/>
1) It&#39;s pretty clear that we all don&#39;t want Verant (or anyone else) snooping<br/>
around in such things as Internet directories et al.  If I recall<br/>
correctly - the impression that this was being done - was from a post from a<br/>
Necro board of a log of program that claimed they were reading this.  Has<br/>
anyone here verified this?<br/>
<br/>
Smedly claimed that this was false...<br/>
<br/>
2) Smedly claimed all they did (and I thought Kevin Crawford verified this)<br/>
is that they run a Win32API call to see what active process were and what&#39;s<br/>
in memory.<br/>
<br/>
If this is all Verant is doing - I&#39;m not so sure I have a problem with this.<br/>
I don&#39;t want them reading my hard drive - there is a chance for properitary<br/>
info.  Hypothetically there&#39;s a chance that (say you had a word processor<br/>
doc running) that proprietary info is in memory - but that&#39;s kind of a<br/>
stretch.  Plus - if you were really concerned about it - you chould just be<br/>
careful to shut everything down before starting EQ (I do this anyway to<br/>
conserve memory).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious what others think about this.  Again - no scanning of file -<br/>
simply checking memory and active processes.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s kind of silly about this - is how hard is it to change the name of<br/>
the program?  Couldn&#39;t you even code the program to generate a random<br/>
process name everytime you ran?<br/>
<br/>
And isn&#39;t there a REALLY simple solution to thsi?  Couldn&#39;t Verant encrypt<br/>
their packets?  Perhaps this additional overhead would negatively impact<br/>
performance - but I&#39;d think if they are clever enough they could come up<br/>
with something that would make it really hard for these programs.<br/>
Especially since they could subtly change the algorhtym ever time they<br/>
patch..<br/>
