<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464398962">Well I just happen to be camped out at the Grub and Grog tavern so I guess<br/>
tonight I&#39;ll try to complete the Fabian quest.  I sure hope by the time I<br/>
log in that someone on this list or The Concert Hall can confirm if the<br/>
quest was implemented properly.  Reports from the Test server last week<br/>
indicate it was broken on that server.<br/>
<br/>
What were the problems with the other two quests listed below?  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
even aware that there was a mino horn quest.  Anyone got the details on it?<br/>
And isn&#39;t Travis Twostring the bard mailman in Nek Forest?  Its been so long<br/>
since I did any of the mail delivery quests that I can&#39;t remember with 100%<br/>
certainty exactly who Travis Twostring is.    <br/>

Don&#39;t get me wrong...I am thrilled this has been<br/>
fixed.  But didn&#39;t Gordon recently say something like:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are no broken quests, only pre-set stories for<br/>
future expansion&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
*Quest Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed the &quot;Minotaur Horns&quot; Quest<br/>
***snip***<br/>
- Fixed the &quot;Travis Twostring&quot; quest.<br/>
- The Fleshy Orb quest and &quot;Fabian&quot; should<br/>
really be fixed now. These were not correct after<br/>
the last patch due to a data export issue.<br/>
<br/>
