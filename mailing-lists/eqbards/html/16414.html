<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011014800"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My thurs group ( I am a cleric there) warrior and I (we&#39;re roomates)<br/>
&gt; were waiting for Beyond the Mat to start so we logged on and decided to<br/>
&gt; try the Langseax quest once (5 normal langs so far, good money, but not<br/>
&gt; the prize we&#39;ve been looking for).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Be careful how often you decide to do this quest.  Or you&#39;ll find <br/>
  that you cannot bank in Halas.  The banker is a member of the<br/>
  rogue guild.  And he won&#39;t mind wiping the floor with you if he<br/>
  sees you.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, low dubious to said banker ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  Plus, I&#39;m KOS to corrupt guards in Qeynos.  And Lt. Dagnor or<br/>
  whatever his name is doesn&#39;t mind dropping a 600 HT and 350 dmg<br/>
  per attack melee on you either.  So where are all these &#39;good&#39;<br/>
  guards?  Shouldn&#39;t they be standing up for me?  Yet another <br/>
  flaw of the faction system.</div>
