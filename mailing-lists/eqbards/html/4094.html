&gt; First of all, having better equipment doesn&#39;t mean you explore *less*. It<br/>
&gt; means (for instance) being able to go to High Hold, or the Eastern Karanas,<br/>
&gt; a level earlier than you normally could. Nor does it affect knowledge of<br/>
&gt; equipment- at level 13, you&#39;re either wearing leather, banded, or bronze,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having better equipment means you will have an easier time<br/>
against mobs - there&#39;s no denying that, otherwise there&#39;d be<br/>
no point to getting better equipment.  When you have an easier<br/>
time against mobs -&gt; you rack up experience faster -&gt; you<br/>
level more quickly -&gt; you have less time to explore areas<br/>
appropriate for your level -&gt; you explore less.  Unless of<br/>
course you refrain from fighting, or enjoy exploring areas<br/>
where everything is green to you and afraid to attack you<br/>
(which I had to do with most of Paw and all of Blackburrow -<br/>
and which is why I don&#39;t give others advice on how to play<br/>
there, except for location information).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This gets back to what I said about there always being<br/>
something bigger and meaner than you.  You do not get more<br/>
quests, you simply get different (higher level) ones.  The low<br/>
level quests that would normally mean something to someone<br/>
your level are now worthless because your equipment is already<br/>
better than what you&#39;d receive as a reward.  In the end, it&#39;s<br/>
a washout.  Yes you get to do your L10-L15 quests in a hurry,<br/>
but now the quests that were supposed to sustain you from L16<br/>
to L25 have to sustain you from L13 to L25.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Second, 250pp is not 250,000. Yes, that will buy you a set of bronze, but it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mean you must immediately stop looking for better stuff until you<br/>
&gt; make 10 more levels. On the contrary- it means you can save up money for the<br/>
&gt; *truly* useful items, like some elf hide gloves (if you&#39;re not an elf, that<br/>
&gt; is &lt;G&gt;) or a battle drum. It&#39;s not exactly a godly plate of the whale-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t follow your reasoning at all.  You can keep the crown,<br/>
and save up for banded/bronze.  If you run across someone<br/>
selling elf hide gloves or a battle drum, you can sell/trade<br/>
the crown then.  If you aren&#39;t so fortunate, then you still<br/>
have the crown.  Like I said, the crown is rare enough that<br/>
you can get trade-only items for it.  That gives it the edge<br/>
over saving platinum IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; actually, every one of my characters after the first have made at least a<br/>
&gt; hundred pp by level 15 (fairly, I might add, without using any trade skills<br/>
&gt; or even camping for lore items like everyone else), and some have gotten<br/>
&gt; much more than that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So if money is that easy, why sell the crown?  I hit 100pp at<br/>
around L13 by the way.  Accounting for all the stuff I gave<br/>
away, I probably hit 250pp around L18.  I had 250pp in the<br/>
bank at around L20.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Finally, why is having a full set of bronze, a dirk, and money in the bank<br/>
&gt; (i.e., not having to worry about where your next song is coming from- that<br/>
&gt; was a very real concern to me at that level) somehow less &#39;noble&#39; or &#39;fair&#39;<br/>
&gt; than wearing all patchwork except for an admittedly very nice crown on your<br/>
&gt; head?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When did I say it was less noble?  In this thread, I said it<br/>
was robbing yourself of experience.  In a previous meta-issues<br/>
thread I said it upset the balance of the game.  I have never<br/>
criticized twinking because I felt it was unfair or ignoble.<br/>
I&#39;ve only criticized it because I felt it caused problems for<br/>
the twinker (which doesn&#39;t really matter because it&#39;s his<br/>
decision to deprive himself) and for the non-twinker (which<br/>
does matter since he doesn&#39;t have any control it).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other. But using a fairly gotten reward to make the next few levels less<br/>
&gt; painful- to, perhaps, get to see High Hold or Unrest a few days ahead of<br/>
&gt; time- isn&#39;t exactly cheating, at least in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me use your example.  Would it be wise to do something<br/>
which lets you, say, see Mistmoore a few days ahead of time,<br/>
*before* you&#39;ve had a chance to thoroughly explore/experience<br/>
Unrest and Highhold?  If you&#39;ve seen it all already with<br/>
another character, then I completely agree with you.  But I<br/>
got the impression that wasn&#39;t the case here.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to fully experience the game, don&#39;t take<br/>
shortcuts.<br/>
