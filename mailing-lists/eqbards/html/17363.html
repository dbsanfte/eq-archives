<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504749614">I am a level 43 (almost 44) Bard on Veeshan and I was wondering if anyone<br/>
could suggest what equipment of mine I should get rid of and what I should<br/>
replace it with, this is what I am wearing.....<br/>
<br/>

Earings - 2 Diamondines<br/>
Face - Mask of Deception<br/>
Neck - Golden BP Choker<br/>
Shoulders - Carnel Pauldrons (from kobold priest)<br/>
Breastplate - Mithril<br/>
Cloak - Hooded Black Cloak<br/>
Vambraces - Lambent<br/>
Bracers - Both Serpentine (sigh)<br/>
Gloves - Lambent<br/>
Rings - 1 x +5 ac +55 hp&#39;s and 1 x +5 Str/Dex<br/>

Now with this gear I look like a fashion disaster (in woodelf form, Dark<br/>
Elf form looks ok). I am keen on suggestions as to what items I should<br/>
upgrade or keep and whether anyone has suggestions on new gear (I would<br/>
like full mithril, but so would everyone).<br/>
