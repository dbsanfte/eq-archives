more depressing things I found about high level. I didn&#39;t realise how<br/>
much I&#39;d come to depend on charm to bail out healers and casters from<br/>
frenzied mobs until I couldn&#39;t use it anymore.<br/>

Unfortunately, from that reply from GZ posted a while back, I can&#39;t see<br/>
that happening. It seems he feels that having our charm last 15 sec<br/>
compared to whatever time an enchanter&#39;s lasts isn&#39;t enough, so he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want us to be able to charm at high levels. He said it would be<br/>
too powerful.<br/>
