<div id="ygrps-yiv-901622839">Pretty good point I hadn&#39;t though about yet... I think it is so much<br/>
clicking around that I miss most of the fun from fighting scenarios and the<br/>
other players moves and all... It surely takes a lot of attention for us to<br/>
keep twisting songs, we could use all that attention helping tanks to<br/>
protect casters or anything else...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;The amount of RL finger twiddling that bards do to make their abilities work<br/>
&gt;is so far above that required by any other class, we might as well be<br/>
&gt;playing a different game.  I had a friend over last week who plays fairly<br/>
&gt;regularly with me, he&#39;s the ranger from the test actually although his<br/>
&gt;primary is now a druid.  When he saw the constant button manipulation<br/>
&gt;required by bards during combat he was stunned.  He had always agreed we<br/>
&gt;were a little underpowered, but felt all melee classes were.  When he saw<br/>
&gt;what we have to do to make our abilities function he though that anyone who<br/>
&gt;had to go through all that ought to see some benefit from it that was more<br/>
&gt;significant than we do.  He said he would rather just have mana than go<br/>
&gt;through all that constant finger waggling.<br/>
