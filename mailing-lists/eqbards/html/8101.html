<div id="ygrps-yiv-342855707">Heh well your new set of spells every 4 levels are usually an upgrade to<br/>
existing spells. Like I said twinking only bypasses the first 15-16 levels<br/>
anyway. If I swapped chars with even the lowest level of my closest friends<br/>
a 35 druid it would be a big diffrence. However I think I may try it out for<br/>
the fun of it anyway.<br/>

&gt;Then I propose an experiment.  You (I assume you&#39;re high<br/>
&gt;level) and a good friend you&#39;ve grouped with often swap<br/>
&gt;accounts and characters.  Both of you should have considerable<br/>
&gt;experience grouping with the class you&#39;re swapping to, but no<br/>
&gt;playtime as that class.  Then see how well you do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s very easy to learn a class at least I believe so. Also as to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I disagree because if it were, I&#39;d have quit the game<br/>
&gt;back in May.  Maybe the other classes are easy to learn.  All<br/>
&gt;I know is it took me a good 3 weeks to optimize to my<br/>
&gt;satisfaction my solo play with my enchanter using an<br/>
&gt;animation.  I&#39;m almost to my 3rd month now, and I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt;learning new points and strategies in group play every day.<br/>
&gt;On top of this, I get a set of new spells every 4 levels which<br/>
&gt;sends me back almost to square one appraising which work<br/>
&gt;better, work worse, or don&#39;t work.<br/>
