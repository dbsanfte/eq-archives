&gt; Can anybody describe to me how they best us their charm to hunt for exp and<br/>
&gt; coins? I remember seeing comments like &quot;with charm, our group had no<br/>
&gt; downtime&quot;. I can only imagine charming a HG to fight another one for a<br/>
&gt; couple rounds then the HG will wake up and run toward me and I&#39;ll have to<br/>
&gt; charm again.... I dont even think this will work since you might get hit<br/>
&gt; before second charm or even stunned and stop singing (do you even have time<br/>
&gt; to turnaround sing speed song and pull the distance off?) or get resisted<br/>
&gt; once then got hit 60dam, 70dam again by TWO HGs. From what i imagine, a<br/>
&gt; bard would die most of the time charming one HG to hit another.<br/>

You don&#39;t have to be stopped to start a song - you can do it<br/>
on the run.<br/>
<br/>
Charm&#39;s range is much much greater than melee range.<br/>
<br/>
So keep Accelerando playing.  When you see a giant, charm it,<br/>
restart Accelerando, and order it to attack.  When it becomes<br/>
uncharmed, just recharm it while running to stay out of melee<br/>
range.<br/>
