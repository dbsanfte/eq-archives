hard to fight.<br/>

/em Looks oddly at his horn, let&#39;s out a few choice curses and begins to<br/>
beat A Mountain Giant Hillock about the knees with the damn thing.<br/>
<br/>
This was after a string of about 20 resists or missed notes while trying to<br/>
do all instruments at the giant castle in Frontier Mountains.  And yes, my<br/>
stupid brass skill was maxed for my previous level, had just Dinged though<br/>
so needed those 5 new points yet.<br/>

do a /e sings a song praising ...<br/>
<br/>
pretty humdrum IMHO.  Best emotes I&#39;ve seen are:<br/>
<br/>
/e pulls a multi colored cube from his pocket, twists<br/>
it until all the facets match and puts it away<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
/e kicks mob in the jimmy for 113 points of damage<br/>
(done by a halfling fighting a cycolps)<br/>
<br/>
would love to see what bardic emotes are used by list readers...<br/>
