<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231797632"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; It also makes a nice screen shot to see a bard playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; [Lullaby on ] a lute in the middle of dead npc bodies<br/>
&gt; &gt; everywhere..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You should try an overhead screenshot while doing this<br/>
&gt; sometime.  All the mobs form a circle around you exactly<br/>
&gt; facing you.  Looks like a bunch of groupies.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh, that&#39;s what I do. Whenever I get into a fight I hit F9 three times to<br/>
get an overhead view.. I can&#39;t stand to fight in first person view anymore..<br/>
Having that overhead view has saved my hide more than once as I watched<br/>
other mob&#39;s come running towards me.</div>
