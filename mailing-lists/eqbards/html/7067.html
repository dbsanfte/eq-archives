I don&#39;t think there is any good &quot;balance&quot; issue served. Melee classes don&#39;t seem<br/>
to have any special talent to offset their lack of binding ability. I think when<br/>
Verant decided not to implement a &quot;Lifestone&quot; sort of model for changing a<br/>
character&#39;s return point, they were forced to give this ability to the<br/>
characters. The casting classes seemed to be the logical choice, since changing<br/>
this &quot;mystical bond&quot; does involve manipulation of magical forces. But melee<br/>
classes never really got anything in return. And I don&#39;t believe they ever will.<br/>
I think players have to understand that choosing a melee class means you WILL be<br/>
dependent upon the binding abilities of others throughout your character&#39;s life.<br/>
You can accept that and play a melee class anyway, or not accept that and play a<br/>
caster class. I&#39;m not too hopeful of seeing other options coming forth on a<br/>
class-wide basis. (However, I do see the possibility of more items with Bind<br/>
Affinity effects being made available.)<br/>

Yah, probly time to close this whole thing out...<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, I don&#39;t mind being at the mercy of binders...I just want to<br/>
be bound in non-city locations.<br/>
<br/>
And having to choose between a class I don&#39;t want to play, and having to endure<br/>
the walk-of-shame is pretty unappealing.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I have to say that most greens can really be deadly to a naked melee<br/>
guy.   Also, saying that other classes (casters, btw) can help you isn&#39;t really<br/>
a solution.  They may be willing to cast on you, but I rarely find them on way<br/>
to my body.  Besides, that doesn&#39;t solve the problem, it just makes you more<br/>
dependent on others...<br/>

Sigh...sooo bitter these days! :)<br/>
