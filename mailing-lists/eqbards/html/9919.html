<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518823223">Like fine wine, songs get better with some age.  I had trouble with charm at<br/>
first and now at 35 it works pretty good for me. Also, it took me some time<br/>
to learn how.  Also, I bought a crude stein +15 cha that I equip for serious<br/>
charm sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Hot Keys:<br/>
<br/>
1 - charm<br/>
2 - /pet attack<br/>
3 - /pet guard here<br/>
4 - /pet back off<br/>
5 (i use for some thing else)<br/>
6 - /pet guard me (i think - not that important)<br/>
<br/>
Say your puller brings 2 or 3 mobs and you have crowd control duty (ie no<br/>
enchanter)<br/>
<br/>
Process (and this was learned from someone else&#39;s great post here)<br/>
<br/>
Target mob you want to charm (pick the lower con)<br/>
charm<br/>
target mob you want it to fight<br/>
pet attack <br/>
F1 F1 (re-target pet and back out of melee)<br/>
/g DREAD IS CHARM! (meaning the dread wolf who came with the rotting knight)<br/>
(important to tell group unless they are well disciplined at /assist)<br/>
re-charm (when he breaks loose - which will be about now on the first round)<br/>
(pet will run to u when charm breaks but when you recharm he runs back to<br/>
fite other mob -- if former pet hits you - back further away)<br/>
re-charm (now you can get a feel for when to re-charm and try to get him<br/>
before he breaks back to you)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it really.  Keys are stay back so you have time to re-charm<br/>
before getting hit. <br/>
<br/>
The pet guard here is for making an escape.  Charm, pet guard here, then<br/>
run.  Do not re-charm because it will make pet come to you if it is not agro<br/>
on something else.<br/>
<br/>
In the wide open spaces, try this.  Charm a pet you want to die while being<br/>
pet (greenie who dont give u xp), run, find a mob you want to kill for xp.<br/>
Run to it so it attacks you. Charm pet u still have chasing you.  Pet will<br/>
by default be in guard you mode and attack your attacker.  Kite the mob<br/>
until it turn on pet. Charm and recharm the pet along the way.<br/>

I need some assistance with Charm.  I&#39;ve had this song for several levels<br/>
now and just simply can&#39;t figure out the proper method of using it.  I see<br/>
messages from some of the talented bards on this list saying &quot;Yeah, two Hill<br/>
Giants, no biggie.  I just charmed them against one another and got both<br/>
kills.&quot;  I would be dead or zonign within 15 rounds if I tried this.  At<br/>
level 31 HGs are still red to me, so let&#39;s take the Choon and Froon brothers<br/>
as examples because they&#39;re blue.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how I think it should work (remember, my base INT is only 75):<br/>
<br/>
- Set up a hotkey panel with Selo&#39;s, Charm, &quot;/pet attack&quot;, &quot;/pet back off&quot;.<br/>
- Equip drum and fire up Selo&#39;s.<br/>
- Sneak up to the bros and Charm one.<br/>
- Assuming Charm sticks, the other will probably immediately attack it due<br/>
to its inheriting my factions, but if not, click on the other brother and<br/>
hit &quot;/pet attack&quot; hotkey.<br/>
- Click on original charmee.<br/>
- Start Selo&#39;s.<br/>
- Watch ensuing battle.<br/>
- When Charm breaks and brother runs toward me, hit Charm again.<br/>
- Assuming Charm sticks, the charmee *should* return to previous &quot;/pet<br/>
attack&quot; status.<br/>
- Repeat until one is dead.<br/>
- Once one is dead, the problem shifts to a kite or chain/fear issue to<br/>
finish survivor off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried this.  Hell I can&#39;t even make this work with Orc Centurians in<br/>
East Commonlands.  Either I totally misunderstand something or I&#39;m just not<br/>
coordinated to pull it off.<br/>
