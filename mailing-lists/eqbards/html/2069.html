Lore means that only one instance of a unique item may be possessed by a<br/>
player.  Lore items of one type do not affect  lore items of another type.<br/>
<br/>
So, you can have a Dragoon Dirk, a Rubicite Breastplate, a Polished Granite<br/>
Tomahawk, all tagged LORE, for instance, all at one time.  If you then try<br/>
to pick up or trade another Dragoon Dirk(or any other lore item that you<br/>
already have in inventory, including your bank), it simply vanishes, gone<br/>
forever.<br/>
<br/>
This warrants some caution when looting mobs.  LOOK at the item before you<br/>
pick it up, it  may be a lore item you already posses, or it may be a No<br/>
Drop item.  Best to leave it on the corpse if in a group, and let the<br/>
designated recipient pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
And the rapier/dirk look is cool, IMHO...reminds me of the old Musketeer era<br/>
duelists, who commonly used both a long blade and a dagger or main gauche,<br/>
for parrying and extra attacks.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re REALLY concerned, there are several other dagger classed weapons,<br/>
some very good, that you can aquire.  Jambiya, Obsidian Shard, etc.<br/>

&gt;I just don&#39;t understand how lore items will work.  Was thinking the dirks<br/>
&gt;would look great dual wielded, but it&#39;s a lore item so I can have only one?<br/>
&gt;But what about quests where you must have multiple lore items in your<br/>
&gt;possesion?  Will they be changed, no longer lore items?  Now that I will be<br/>
&gt;using a dirk, will this mean if I accidentally talk to an npc in such a way<br/>
&gt;that they hand me a lore item, it will destroy my weapon?  Or will these<br/>
&gt;&quot;keep only one&quot; only apply to items that are pending lore?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With a rapier and a dirk I look sort of silly, would be nice to wield two.<br/>
