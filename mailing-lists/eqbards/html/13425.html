&gt; &gt;&gt; Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; This was done to correct issues that could arise from people<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; chain-casting these items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Speaking of which, is it unreasonable to set our default <br/>
&gt; travelling pace to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Run&quot; so that we don&#39;t have to turn this on whenever we log <br/>
&gt; in. Does anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;walk&quot; in this game? (&quot;sneakers&quot; don&#39;t count) This is one of <br/>
&gt; the ways I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;spot a newbie&quot; is the fact that they&#39;re walking around in the newbie<br/>
&gt; &gt;killing zones, casually sauntering around trying to catch up <br/>
&gt; to things to<br/>
&gt; &gt;kill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I walk in Blackburrow -- where you go up and down that ladder.<br/>
&gt; And sometimes in Kelethin too. If its been a while since I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, wait until you get Safe Fall, then you&#39;ll be jumping off of those<br/>
bridges, who needs an elevator to get down? :-)<br/>
<br/>
But thanks for bringing up a few situations where walk might be useful. I&#39;m<br/>
aways falling off of those ladders while trying to get out of the water in<br/>
places like Guk or Crushbone. Maybe walk will make it easier to climb out of<br/>
these things.<br/>
