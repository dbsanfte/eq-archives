Bard Bugs/Not a Whine (v2000.05.22) - long <br/>
Abashi/Brad/Gordon, I have compiled a list of all bard bugs to date for your<br/>
review and comments. Sorry this is so long, but there are a lot of bugs. <br/>
<br/>
(his answer)<br/>
<br/>
I apologize but it is taking a bit longer than I&#39;d hoped to look into these<br/>
issues. As some will notice, at least one issue has been resolved with<br/>
another being considered publicly. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get back with you soon. <br/>
<br/>
Just one note, has anyone tried the two psalms mentioned recently? Just a<br/>
few weeks ago a bug was corrected that was causing secondary effects on bard<br/>
songs to fail. <br/>
