<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874309789">Charming Cycs and Griffs?  How do you get around the problem where the<br/>
target is faster than your charm&#39;s melee and you have to take a hit<br/>
before your charm can start the combat?  It&#39;s the only reason why I&#39;m<br/>
not soloing the giant camp in Frontier Mtns right now.  I can get one<br/>
charmed and sic it on a second but when the charm breaks and I have to<br/>
recharm my thrall the other giant gets far enough away that I have to<br/>
take a hit (ouch) to keep it in place long enough for my pet to hit it.<br/>
Am I doing something wrong or should I start mixing in chains on the<br/>
target or what?  Aanndd.. at best (w/o cha bracers and lambent) my<br/>
charisma tops out at 133, that&#39;s with 2x cha rings, 1 lambent bracer, 1<br/>
lambent gauntlet, +9cha neck and +13 from my MoD (yea yea, i didn&#39;t<br/>
allocate any cha at start...)<br/>

&gt; they resist a LOT at level 30 and 31.  32 it gets a lot better.  I<br/>
&gt; stuck to Clopses and griffies and such till level 32.<br/>
