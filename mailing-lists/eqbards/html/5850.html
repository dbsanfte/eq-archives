<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049098554"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ll start a Troll Shaman or something.  Lotta fun.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got an Ogre Shaman - it&#39;s a very close tie as<br/>
to which is more entertaining between that and my<br/>
half-elf Bard. My Bard can get into cities though,<br/>
so that keeps me playing him.. That and at level 14,<br/>
the mana consumption of a Shaman is very high and<br/>
results in boring medding times that we don&#39;t have<br/>
to go through with our Bards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what happened to you here, but I&#39;ve<br/>
dropped my Dragoon Dirk (LORE) and picked it up<br/>
again. Being LORE simply means that you can&#39;t<br/>
own two of them. Your claws should have been on<br/>
the ground where you dropped them. Maybe not very<br/>
visible - but still there.</div>
