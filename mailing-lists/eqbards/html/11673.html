<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667410356">greetings, I know where he is but its REALLY hard to explain it would need<br/>
to bre shown to you.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I was writting this to you is to let ya know I have passed my his<br/>
spot several thousand times ( i check everytime I go to lower guk) and when<br/>
I didnt see him there I would carry on my merry singing way.. one day I was<br/>
bored  and maybe I caught him right as he spawns but<br/>
<br/>
Just to let you know he casts invis on him self.. since I saw him cast that<br/>
on him self  I go there with see invis on and have caught him in passing<br/>
alot more often :)..<br/>
<br/>
Best I can help on directions is he is ubove the fungus garden and off one<br/>
of the main halls to get to lower guk.. There is  a few jail cells in the<br/>
room that sometimes hol troll prisoners.. There is a raised plank in the<br/>
middle that  spawns some knights on top.. If I remember right on one side in<br/>
the room there is some water that has some gators in it..<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps...<br/>
