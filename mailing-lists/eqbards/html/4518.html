<div id="ygrps-yiv-849470864"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ah well, maybe they fixed it?  Nothing there I ever found, <br/>
&gt; but as I swam along the bottom, squinting my eyes in the<br/>
&gt; murk, I somehow dropped through the earth<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah. That might still be there, I didn&#39;t swim down to the bottom I simply<br/>
looked around from the surface with my eyes just in the water enough to be<br/>
able to see clearly.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more other waters, and find a chest which actually says it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; locked some time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re meaning by a particular dock and needing to kill a<br/>
particular sea roaming creature. I&#39;m able to easily kill it, but not with<br/>
enough speed as to prevent it from going off and supposedly losing the chest<br/>
before coming back to fight more. (Least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve read happens)</div>
