<div id="ygrps-yiv-319249150">I defeated Choon and Froon once at level 27 and again at level 29, both<br/>
times using charm.  The second time was super easy since I had my brother&#39;s<br/>
druid snaring the one I wasn&#39;t charming, so when I switched to the winning<br/>
cyclops, it could catch the other easy.  My only death using this method was<br/>
because I got a little sure of myself and tried to charm them in the rain<br/>
and Fog :-(.<br/>

&gt; 1.	Mistmoore - no clue.  Mid 30&#39;s place afik.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  Choon & Froon (gay clops?) live in West Karana on top of a hill with a<br/>
&gt; really nice view of the Oger Camp (don&#39;t get near even though they con<br/>
&gt; amiable - the Chief don&#39;t and he will harm touch for 400 and agro the rest<br/>
&gt; onto you) and the strolling Hill Giants.  If you enter West K from the NK<br/>
&gt; near the river past the Stone Bridge, go about 1/3 of the way across the<br/>
&gt; zone (hmm, kinda tough to judge if you are new to the zone) then go due<br/>
&gt; North.  Alternatively, you could follow the road thru north<br/>
&gt; karana and enter<br/>
&gt; west k on the road.  Keep following it and stay out of the hills.<br/>
&gt; Skirt the<br/>
&gt; bottom of the hills (snarf the ghoul messenger boy, werewolfie, and any<br/>
&gt; meandering HG&#39;s if you want) and look for a shop where Brenzl<br/>
&gt; McManus sells<br/>
&gt; his fletching goods (track Brenzl if you can).  Right behind his shop - up<br/>
&gt; on the hill Choon and Froon.  Yes, if you work argo radius, you<br/>
&gt; can pull em<br/>
&gt; singles, I found that out when I tried to Lament and pulled a single.<br/>
&gt; Fear-Chain-DoT-DD, rinse, repeat.  I prefer to have a helper and SoW.  I<br/>
&gt; tried to charm one time and was resisted - but that was a couple<br/>
&gt; levels back<br/>
&gt; and maybe did not wear all my cha stuff.  They are prolly low 30&#39;s - high<br/>
&gt; 20&#39;s?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		I have a few questions this morning for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		1)  Which room in Mistmoore is the home of the gypsy lute<br/>
&gt; dropping gypsies?  How do I get there?  Is there a secret way<br/>
&gt; (i.e. through<br/>
&gt; the secret room in the graveyard) which could be less hazardous to a group<br/>
&gt; of around 30&#39;s? (I too share Shada&#39;s propensity for being lost - hehe.  My<br/>
&gt; train hotkey shouts &quot;TRAIN TO......UM......Just watch out!&quot;)<br/>
&gt; Once I get to<br/>
&gt; said room, how difficult a place is it?  3 spawns, 4?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		2)  Where are Choon and Froon (I&#39;ve spent the vast majority<br/>
&gt; of my time on the East coast, so I&#39;m not too familiar with the Karanas)?<br/>
&gt; About what level are they?  Is it possible to pull one without the other?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		And in another non-related vein:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		Can anyone please post or supply the web address to a<br/>
&gt; comprehensive list of Bard skill caps?  And once more, where do<br/>
&gt; you have to<br/>
&gt; go to train that first point in Instill Doubt?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		Thanks ahead of time for all the help,<br/>
