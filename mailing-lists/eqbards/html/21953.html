&gt;&gt; Anyway, enough said ... this isn&#39;t an enchanter list after all =)<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But it&#39;s good to know what other classes are capable of, though it can<br/>
&gt;make you even more annoyed at being told you are fine the way you are.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually I just felt I was getting into my detailed enchanter-type<br/>
tactics that most people wouldn&#39;t care about! :-)<br/>
<br/>
After being a bard for over 18 months and watching all my group<br/>
members, and even playing most of those classes to some degree, I feel<br/>
that I know enough of what other classes can do.  I&#39;m constanty amazed<br/>
at some people&#39;s reactions (even at 30+ and 40+) when I do things and<br/>
they didn&#39;t know I could do that.  Enchanter OR bard!<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s important for us bards to know what others can do so we can<br/>
slot into a group and plug that little niche that isn&#39;t filled when we<br/>
join.  That&#39;s supposed to be what we&#39;re there for.  Allegedly.<br/>
