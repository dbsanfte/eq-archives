<div id="ygrps-yiv-257543216"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ha! Great screenshots...thanks for sharing them :-)... and<br/>
&gt; congrats on 50!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Np =)   That&#39;s when I made 50 about a month ago?  I don&#39;t remember.<br/>
  Ask Sylly she was there leeching greens off me.  I forgot the date.<br/>
  I had just found the picture yesterday and saw the post about Ogre<br/>
  guards.  They are definitely good exp all the way up to and in 50.<br/>

  PS&gt;  Sylly you need to get in there and kill more of those!<br/>
       If I get a group to go in there, I&#39;ll invite you along<br/>
       one night.  I need plat bad (thought I&#39;d never say that<br/>
       again) - I&#39;ve blown 1200pp on soulstones, which imo is<br/>
       ridiculous.  There should be a walkable gate into hate.</div>
