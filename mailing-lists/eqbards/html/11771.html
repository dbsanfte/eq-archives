 </span></blockquote>Ah, now things start to make sense.  UO and EQ are rather<br/>
different.  EQ is advancement-based.  UO is interaction-based.  <br/>
In UO, I would probably agree with most everything you&#39;ve<br/>
said.  In EQ, advancement depends on finding things to kill,<br/>
which depends on how many things there are to kill, which<br/>
depends on how quickly everyone else is killing them, which is<br/>
why I&#39;ve been disagreeing with you.<br/>
