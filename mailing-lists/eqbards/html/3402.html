<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068345314">Someone mentioned that Hymn stacked with them and another bard.  This<br/>
happened to me last night with both Hymn and Jig.  We were both level 18,<br/>
this is probably why it happened.  I think that with different level bards,<br/>
the higher bard wins out on the song, but if you&#39;re both the same level, it<br/>
can&#39;t decide.  Wish I had checked the healing rates though.<br/>
<br/>
	Right now, I&#39;m fighting alot in Permafrost, and last night, I decided it<br/>
was better for me to forgo my weapons to use a drum for Elemental and<br/>
Guardian Rhythyms, at least against the casters.  Are there any other combos<br/>
like this where it&#39;s best to forgo my weapon and damage to better the rest<br/>
of the fighters?<br/>
<br/>
	Also, I&#39;m just now starting my collection of Bronze armour.  Is steel that<br/>
much more difficult to obtain?( from monsters)  And is weight the only<br/>
difference?<br/>
