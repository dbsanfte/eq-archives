&gt; If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard route?  What<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve played every class but the necro to 20-30&#39;s and there really is no<br/>
class near as fun between about 15-40 then the bard.  Almost every single<br/>
person complaining about the bard complains about 40+ when songs like Charm,<br/>
Lullaby, Lament, Pixie, etc. become practically useless and about your only<br/>
real worth is as a mana maker or a resist enhancer...  A bard between about<br/>
15-40 though is an asset in every situation and simply a blast to play.<br/>
What makes it fun?  Below level 40 or so, you find that you have more useful<br/>
songs then you have memorization spaces available.  You are the puller,<br/>
crowd control, corpse recovery specialist, secondary healer, etc.  You get<br/>
to be a little bit of enchanter, druid, and warrior with the extra added<br/>
ability to play songs on the run (chains as a back up to snare simply<br/>
rocks).  I say stay with the bard and hopefully some of the 40+ problems<br/>
will be fixed by the time you get there.<br/>
