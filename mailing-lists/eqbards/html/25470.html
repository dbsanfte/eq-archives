<b>Subject:</b> Re: AW: [eqbards] Bard Stacking? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971273141">Here&#39;s the deal as best as I understand it:<br/>
<br/>
Bards have different (and much more liberal) stacking rules than other classes.  Up to now, those rules<br/>
applied to anything the Bard did - not just singing, but weapon procs as well.  This meant that weapon<br/>
procs/effects which were spells (e.g., copies of another class&#39; spell) would stack in circumstances where<br/>
the parent class couldn&#39;t stack a spell.  For example, if a Bard proced Orb of Tishan on a MOB, then a<br/>
Chanter cast Tash, then a Bard proced Journeyman&#39;s Walking Stick, you&#39;d get three additive MR debuffs (for<br/>
a massive MR reduction) where the parent class could only stack one.  Verant kinda doesn&#39;t like this too<br/>
much, and I can&#39;t say I blame them.<br/>
<br/>
So Verant was testing some code to make spell procs/effects from Bard-wielded items (weapons, armor, etc.)<br/>
follow the same stacking rules as those for normal casters.  They were in the middle of testing this when<br/>
they screwed up some other piece of code and created a dupe bug, which caused them to put in the emergency<br/>
patch last Thursday.  Sadly, their version control is not the best (as any experience Bard should well<br/>
know), and the incomplete and not-ready-for-prime-time stacking modifications went live at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was that they flagged ALL item procs and effects as spells, when in fact several of the ones<br/>
on Bard items should have been flagged as songs.  The biggest problem this caused was the Epic proc<br/>
failing to stack (even over itself) in many circumstances.  I was on a raid last night where it proced and<br/>
I saw the following:<br/>
<br/>
Your spell has failed to take hold.<br/>
Your spell has failed to take hold.<br/>
Your spell has failed to take hold.<br/>
Your spell has failed to take hold.<br/>
Your spell has failed to take hold.<br/>
Your spell has failed to take hold.<br/>
<br/>
e.g., a failure for every member of the party.  They apparently couldn&#39;t fix everything in time to make<br/>
this whole big change work correctly as of the most recent patch, so they removed all of the stacking<br/>
changes.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll put them back.  I expect that all multi-class items and many Bard-only items with spell effects<br/>
(SS Bracers, for example) will no longer stack in cases where the parent class could not stack the spell.<br/>
Some small number of Bard items will be flagged as songs (Epic for one) and will stack as they used to.<br/>
<br/>
This affects some very high-end items.  It probably doesn&#39;t affect too many items that most of us have<br/>
seen.  For myself, I expect the following:<br/>
<br/>
My JWS won&#39;t stack on top of Tash.<br/>
My illusion items won&#39;t overwrite each other, which sucks since I hate the stupid werewolf form.<br/>
My Lute of the Howler won&#39;t stack with Focus (as the parent spell does not), but will stack with Raging<br/>
Strength, Mortal Deftness and Talisman of Kragg, so I can have the identical stats with four buffs rather<br/>
than two if I really want to.<br/>
The Epic will work as it did before.<br/>
<br/>
They are NOT changing the way any songs stack (at least as of now).<br/>
