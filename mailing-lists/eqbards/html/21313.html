<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419951400">Well I can only speak for myself, but I&#39;m now inclined to give games that<br/>
include PvP a shot.  I was going to buy UO when it came out until I read<br/>
about the rampant PKing.  So I decided to hold off and buy EQ instead.  But<br/>
I was quickly disappointed that the gameplay in EQ didn&#39;t include the<br/>
questing/adventuring aspects I was used to in single player CRPGs.  EQ was<br/>
my first MMORPG so I wasn&#39;t aware of the difficulties involved in including<br/>
those aspects of gameplay in the game.  As we are all aware, gameplay in EQ<br/>
is almost entirely centered around camping. Well I abhor camping so don&#39;t do<br/>
it anymore.  I have long since stopped worrying about getting phat lewt.<br/>
Only reason I play the game anymore is for the social aspect of grouping<br/>
with my guildmates.  Dungeon crawling is non existent.  Primary purpose of<br/>
guilds is to help you find someone to group with and make raids easier, not<br/>
as a social organization.<br/>
<br/>
So why am I now interested in MMORPGs that include PvP?  <br/>
1)  Since I am no longer concerned with acquiring phat lewt, the impact of<br/>
getting PKed is reduced.  If I do get PKed, my friends in the guild will<br/>
help re-equip me and help me get revenge on the PKer.  <br/>
2)  PvP promotes guilds that act as social entities.  I now think the idea<br/>
of guildwars and largescale PvP battles is more entertaining than PvE.  The<br/>
AI is better plus there is a stronger sense of comaraderie amongst<br/>
guildmates.<br/>
3)  Anarchy Online will include personal quest dungeons that are only<br/>
accessible to the player/group who have obtained the quest.  These dungeons<br/>
will be temporarily created when the quest is given.  The player/group will<br/>
not have to worry about other players/groups interferring.  No training, no<br/>
killstealing, no spawn camping.  Instead it will be true dungeon crawling.<br/>
Work your way thru the dungeon, complete the quest, return to the quest NPC<br/>
and get your reward.  Truly a unique idea that Verant has said is in the too<br/>
hard to do category.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few more but I have to get back to work.<br/>

Some interesting ideas, but it all devolves down to the basic problem<br/>
that grief players will dedicate way more time to figuring out the<br/>
loopholes in the system than any sane developer can spend or afford to<br/>
pay someone to spend conteracting them.<br/>
<br/>
What really bothers me the most is that people have pretty well<br/>
overwhelmingly shown they don&#39;t like this kind of forced pvp, yet so<br/>
many of the new MMORPG developers seem to remain convinced that they<br/>
have the magic bullet that will convince people that they are wrong to<br/>
dislike it. This reminds me far too much of the same kind of arrogance<br/>
that we&#39;ve seen from Verant, where they quite clearly seem to think<br/>
they&#39;ve made a near perfect game if people would just play it the way<br/>
they were supposed to.<br/>

&gt; Yes, and no.  I don&#39;t think they believe that their PvP environment will<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; perfect, but they think it will be good.  I like the concept behind it and<br/>
&gt; generally I abhor PvP because it is all about PK for the most part.  Two<br/>
&gt; things they are doing will make a huge difference.  Like the Team PvP<br/>
&gt; servers, only races openly at war can PvP one another without consequence.<br/>
&gt; The big difference is, there will not be a way to tell the difference<br/>
&gt; between PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s on sight.  If you see an Orc on the road ahead and<br/>
&gt; you are an elf, you know that he is dangerous to you, whether he is a<br/>
player<br/>
&gt; or an npc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Their consequence system is brutal against PK&#39;ers.  If you kill a race<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; you are not at war with, even a mere 5 or 6 times you will suffer enormous<br/>
&gt; problems.  These problems will include having npc bounty-hunters showing<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; to kill you at random.  Playing a PK character would rapidly become<br/>
&gt; unplayable as every time you logged in you were ambush by these npc<br/>
&gt; enforcers.  Even if you kept your PK-ing to a race yours was at war with,<br/>
&gt; you would always find yourself in enemy territory where few would feel any<br/>
&gt; compunction against killing you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wasn&#39;t really interested much in Horizons initailly due to it&#39;s PvP<br/>
&gt; system, but they have convinced me to give it a chance.  They feel their<br/>
PvP<br/>
&gt; system will promote the &#39;risk game&#39; like Player competition while severely<br/>
&gt; punishing to the point of oblivion anyone who PK&#39;s for the joy of hurting<br/>
&gt; others.  Time will tell.<br/>
