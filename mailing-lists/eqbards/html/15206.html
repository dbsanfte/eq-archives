&gt; &gt; Mages can summon a weapon every level.  But Verant hasn&#39;t put the level<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; put into the game.  Still no word on the 49th spell.  Mages are also<br/>
&gt; &gt; incomplete, according to your own definition.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Count the spells...  a class that has over 120+ spells is missing 2...<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s very different than a class with 50 missing three.  BIG<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DIFFERENCE!<br/>
<br/>
Just doing a numerical count doesn&#39;t mean anything.  Bards actually have<br/>
more useful spells than Mages.  Bards don&#39;t get songs that are just an<br/>
upgrade to a previous song.  Every other caster gets new spells that are<br/>
just upgrades to an older spell.  Mages get 40 different Pet spells, 4 at<br/>
each circle.  We get an upgraded DD spell every few circles.  Once we get<br/>
an upgrade, the old spell goes to the back of the spellbook, where it is<br/>
almost never used.<br/>
<br/>
If other casters got one spell that increased in power from lvl 1-50<br/>
instead of upgrades every circle or two, they would have many fewer spells<br/>
than Bards.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; addressed the major concerns of bards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everyone has their own idea as to what their major concerns are.  For some<br/>
Bards, their major concern is to be able to &quot;surf&quot; while Seloing.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you list your major concerns?<br/>
-Your missing 3 spells have been addressed, they will be in the expansion.<br/>

&gt; You think after that Verant would learn from that mistake, and change the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>unresponded<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to for 3 weeks?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is just a guess....<br/>
Verant doesn&#39;t want to respond to the Lillaby post until they can fully<br/>
test it themselves.  Verant has screwed up many times by &quot;testing&quot; alchemy<br/>
or &quot;testing&quot; pet dual wield, and annoucing that nothing was broken, only to<br/>
find out later their tests were flawed.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously you don&#39;t pay attention to any other class issues.  Every single<br/>
class has huge threads on problems percieved in their class.  Verant is<br/>
pushing aside 100&#39;s of issues not related to bards.  Bards did get a new<br/>
spell with some other minor things.  So they are dealing with Bard issues.<br/>

&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything but fixing your Bard.  Verant has to fix problems with every<br/>
&gt; &gt; class.  They can&#39;t stop everything just to fix Bards.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, let me state the obvious... like any EQ player,  I feel good<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You just got to lower your expectations when it comes to Verant.  It&#39;s sad,<br/>
but I don&#39;t expect Verant to fix anything.  When they do fix something, I<br/>
consider it a bonus.  I&#39;ve found my frustration level has gone way down and<br/>
I enjoy the game more.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see Verant to fix things, but I&#39;ve realized that is not<br/>
likely to happen.  Since EQ is currently the best, I&#39;ve decided to live<br/>
with it and enjoy it as much as possible.<br/>
