<div id="ygrps-yiv-895023039">uhmmm, well, last time i was in seb, grouped with a warrior who for some odd<br/>
reason kept telling our wizzie to summon a pet.  the wiz was wearing a red<br/>
robe, /shrug.  then he started to tell me (i was playing my enchanter):<br/>
&quot;mana suck this frog!&quot; and not just one time. he would point to a frog and<br/>
tell me to mana tap it. then tell the wiz to summon a pet. at first we kinda<br/>
made jokes: &quot;dude, i never bought that spell!&quot;  But he didn;t seem to get it<br/>
and kept telling us what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Finally i told him, &quot;dude, just exactly how long is the recycle time on<br/>
theft of thought? when the spell is recycled - and when i need mana - trust<br/>
me - i will tap them.  and btw, our wizzie cant summon pets worth a darn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
so, i dunno if our study is totally scientific, but its not just bards,<br/>
afaict<br/>

I feel your pain...  When I get very frustrated at players like that I often<br/>
say &quot;I don&#39;t tell you how to play you&#39;re your character, please don&#39;t tell<br/>
me how to play mine.  What I find so frustrating; with very few exceptions I<br/>
never see people telling any other classes how to play their character<br/>
except bards.<br/>
