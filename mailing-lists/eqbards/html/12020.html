<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441767821"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;An individual on our server started a hoax a couple weeks back stating<br/>
&gt;they had made a very powerful bard weapon...how unfortunate some people<br/>
&gt;suffer from mental illness and think this is humerous. I do however<br/>
&gt;believe that it&#39;s very probable Walthin&#39;s weapon can be quested for in<br/>
&gt;the game. My faction with the temple is &quot;warmly&quot;, so I can confidently<br/>
&gt;say it&#39;s not an issue of faction. Any rumors, facts, or ideas would be<br/>
&gt;welcome.<br/>
