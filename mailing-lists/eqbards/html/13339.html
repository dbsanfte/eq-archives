&gt; Much as people talk about Bind and Gate, I personally<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  Most of the pet classes (mage the possible exception)<br/>
would be just fine without a pet - still better than any melee<br/>
class.  I got into an argument about this with some guy once -<br/>
he thought it was ok that a L49 pet could kill a L50 melee<br/>
player in a straight one-on-one fight.  His reasoning was that<br/>
duels were a special case.  Pets are balanced because they&#39;re<br/>
dumb, so in a real fight you would always prefer a real tank<br/>
to a pet.  I told him if his reasoning was that intelligent<br/>
player + dumb pet was an acceptable combo, then they should<br/>
allow the melee classes to be able to summon caster pets.  <br/>
Never got a reply to that one...<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve long since given up on petitioning to Verant for any<br/>
sort of class balance.  It&#39;s obvious they&#39;re heavily biased<br/>
towards casting classes.<br/>
