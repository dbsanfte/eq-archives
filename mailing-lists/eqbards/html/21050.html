DoTs have a HUGE agro effect. I learned this a long time ago with my ranger.<br/>
If I slap flame lick on a mob and it is glued to you. (flame lick is an ac<br/>
debuf and a minor dot)<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have learned is that proximity is a huge factor in so far as<br/>
agro is concerned. If you stand just at the edge of melee you&#39;ll see much<br/>
less attention than if you are right under the mob. A good bard can<br/>
manipulate this both ways. I can often &quot;taunt&quot; off of my groups warrior just<br/>
by stepping up to the mob. At the same time I can allow him to taunt off me<br/>
by stepping back a few paces.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] DOTs at 39<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had an eye opening grouping experience yesterday, I&#39;d just like to share<br/>
it and get the more experienced bards comments.<br/>
<br/>
The group:<br/>
Elfson Allegro Lvl 39 half Bard (and a damn handsome man)<br/>
41 Ranger<br/>
35 Enchanter<br/>
38? Druid<br/>
<br/>
For some reason they wanted to group in the dreadlands (3 of these were<br/>
guildies and the 4th was a friend).  I said we&#39;re probably over matched<br/>
there and won&#39;t do very well.  But they wanted to try it, so I agreed.<br/>
<br/>
I decide to go full DOT mode since I figured our only shot was to kill these<br/>
suckers fast. (and I wanted to see if my damage calculations were close to<br/>
correct).<br/>
<br/>
What came as a total shock to me was that the ranger (augmented/buffed,<br/>
wielding a yak and some weird spear/staff which he says is better off hand<br/>
weapon than yak) was unable to keep the monsters from agroing on me.  I sung<br/>
2 chants and Denon&#39;s using Nostrolo Tamborine and a normal horn.<br/>
<br/>
Was it possible that I was outdamaging him?<br/>
<br/>
If I was then I am pretty excited about this song combo.  Granted I can&#39;t<br/>
use Denon&#39;s in a dungeon (AOE damage bad!), but that could be replaced with<br/>
an number of songs (I often use Melodic Binding in a multi pull dungeon<br/>
situation, the enchanters are quite grateful when the mobs that break mez<br/>
come running for me rather than them).<br/>
<br/>
In any case with those 4 (low level for dreadlands) people we were able to<br/>
pull pretty much non stop, with the Ranger pulling anything but Ravishing<br/>
Drolvogs (Those football players hit HARD).  Needless to say the xp was<br/>
amazing (for an outdoor pull), I got like 1.5 of 39 in about 2 hours...  I<br/>
havent seen xp like that since I was doing the lvl 18-2? solo DOT attack.<br/>
<br/>
Of course at the end (&quot;last pull for me guys!&quot;) the new dragon was trained<br/>
to Karnor&#39;s and I got killed in his breath weapon (while getting a screen<br/>
shot!)<br/>
<br/>
