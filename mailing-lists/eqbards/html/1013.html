&gt;You have to go into High Hold itself (another zone in HH<br/>
&gt;Pass).  Inside in the back are two libraries.  One has a man<br/>
&gt;selling wizard spells.  The other has a man selling bard<br/>
&gt;spells (named Justin Rhymes or something, ha ha).  There is a<br/>
&gt;bank in High Hold, so you don&#39;t have to risk any valuable<br/>
&gt;equipment and money on the trip over; although the place was<br/>
&gt;so camped when I went (the mobs there give no less than three<br/>
&gt;highly desired magic items) that I didn&#39;t even need<br/>
&gt;Accelerando and just walked in.  The layout of HH Pass is<br/>
&gt;rather confusing, and if you don&#39;t mind getting a map online,<br/>
&gt;I suggest you do so.  There are no 90 degree turns in the<br/>
&gt;place, and it&#39;s very easy to get disoriented.<br/>

I don&#39;t mind this spoiler as long as it&#39;s not quest-related (?)<br/>
I don&#39;t really like to read spoilers when I&#39;m just surfing the net (I try to <br/>
avoid them), but I do think asking other players in the game about it is ok <br/>
- I see it as part of role-playing.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Highpass is one of my least favorite zones.<br/>
