<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629910157">Some quests are lots better than others - and there are different kinds of<br/>
quests - from very simple to more complicated to ones that seem nice but<br/>
appear to be broken.  Also, it appears that you cha, class and faction play<br/>
a big part of getting the quest as well as the reward (unless reward is<br/>
merely randomized.)<br/>
<br/>
Some quests once you know what they are, you can do along the way while you<br/>
kill for xp.  You just stop by the bards and grab some mail to deliver to<br/>
the place you are probably going anyway.  Hint: write down the name of who<br/>
gets the mail - two hours later and many dead monsters, you prolly forgot<br/>
who gets the mail and if you give to the wrong one - oh well no xp for that<br/>
quest.  Warning: it is dangerous to do quests & trade skills at the same<br/>
time.  A certain package of mail destined for Freeport got brewed in the<br/>
brew barrel &lt;g&gt; (thankful it was not my full backpack!).<br/>
<br/>
And if anyone knows how to do the bandit&#39;s tongues quest (named Butcherblock<br/>
bandits I think) please let me know.  <br/>

		Can anyone tell me the use of qeusts? I completed the string<br/>
quest at the <br/>
		qeynos bard guild and only got 2 copper, some faction hits<br/>
and a litle bit <br/>
		of exp for about a 1,5 hour walk. That was when i was a low<br/>
level ( at +- 7 <br/>
		), now i am 11 and recently moved to freeport,i love selo&#39;s<br/>
and the drum, my <br/>
		shadowknight friend (who&#39;s not as evil as you migth think)<br/>
was very jealous, <br/>
		he walked twice as long as i did from qeynos to freeport<br/>
:)...<br/>
<br/>
		But i&#39;m drifting of, can you tell me what the reward for<br/>
most quests is, <br/>
		because walking for 1,5 hour and getting 2 copper is not<br/>
worth it.<br/>
		And getting exp figthing is much cooler than running.<br/>
