going to win, or obvious we&#39;re going to lose.  Like I said, I<br/>
switched this time because I was certain we were going to<br/>
win.  He&#39;d been steadily dropping in hp for the last 2-3 min,<br/>
and I estimated he&#39;d be dead in another 30-45 seconds.  But<br/>

&gt; You can give your cleric mana. His mana can be used to AE heal multple<br/>
&gt; damage dealers.  Your mana contributions are easily leveraged while your<br/>
&gt; damage with weapons is marginal at best.<br/>

I&#39;ve been asking my healers how long they have to med for an<br/>
