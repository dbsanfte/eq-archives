<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623395831">Again, &quot;THEY&quot; are not identical modules that do generic EQ &quot;work&quot;.  The guy that<br/>
does the animations is not the guy who can fix our songs.  He&#39;s not the<br/>
programmer that changed our Bard Taunt.  He&#39;s not the guy who makes the<br/>
instrument models.<br/>
<br/>
He probly had time, he fixed it.  I don&#39;t think we have any other animation<br/>
issues that he should have been working on, do you?<br/>

Ah but that&#39;s the whole point.  They consider it broken and that&#39;s all that<br/>
really matters as far as Verant is concerned.  What the customer considers<br/>
broken is of little consequence to them, hence the 6+ month delay in<br/>
recognizing that Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody was in fact broken.<br/>

Which was just as cool an effect as the bard &quot;surfing&quot; and makes you<br/>
wonder, don&#39;t they have better things to do that fix things that no one<br/>
considers broken?</div>
