<div id="ygrps-yiv-658833683"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes it is broken for all classes, but... The other classes still have a <br/>
&gt; usuable spell, while our song is completely worthless till they fix it.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I don&#39;t understand why you all think it&#39;s broken for casters?<br/>
  They cannot cast levitate on themselves while they are already<br/>
  levitating - so what?  They never did that before, that I can<br/>
  tell.  You lose lev, remem lev, and recast lev.  The only person<br/>
  I saw jamming on levitate like 50 times was a GM to make him rise<br/>
  high above anyone.  And it&#39;s my belief why they attempted to <br/>
  correct levitate due to the people who would levitate themselves <br/>
  over and over to heights where they could easily overcome obstacles.<br/>
  (The ledge in Permafrost to Lady Vox comes to mind)<br/>
