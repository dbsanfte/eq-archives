<div id="ygrps-yiv-373425805">Yes! In the rare opportunities that I can join a group, I &#39;sing&#39; limericks<br/>
about previous battles during rest phase!<br/>
<br/>
I pulled three comparably leveled adventureres chestnuts out of the fire<br/>
over the last few days and NONE of them wanted to group together. All the<br/>
other premade groups I find are either much higher or lower level than I<br/>
(I&#39;m at the seventh circle) and it&#39;s getting to be a bother! It seems that<br/>
everything is either Red, Yellow or Green these days. Very frustrating!<br/>

&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to start a new thread -- one that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with<br/>
&gt;fees or weapons and the like.  Does anyone, like me, when your group is<br/>
&gt;standing/sitting around healing, ever entertain their group mates with a<br/>
&gt;witty doggerel or some apt prose?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was a little rusty, having had a long vacation (2 weeks) from barding,<br/>
&gt;but I quickly got into the spirit.  To quell the long silences,<br/>
&gt;occasionally broken by a spellcaster casting yet another buff, then sitting<br/>
&gt;down to regenerate mana, I began to change the lyrics of songs that popped<br/>
&gt;into my head to match the moment.  (Ask me sometime, about my &quot;little ditty<br/>
&gt;about Watchman Prynn&quot;.)  Later on I began creating on the spot limericks<br/>
&gt;about my companions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tonight I plan to egg on my party with heroic quotes (checking Tolkien for<br/>
&gt;those) and beautiful tales.  Perhaps I&#39;ll try haiku, as well.<br/>
