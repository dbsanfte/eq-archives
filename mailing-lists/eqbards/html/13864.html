One named mob, randomly placed drops the Ykesha.  Tracking<br/>
helps, running around killing stuff (to make more stuff<br/>
spawn) helps.<br/>

12 &quot;special&quot; mobs, randomly placed to drop items you need for<br/>
the Ykesha quest.  Tracking helps, running around killing<br/>
stuff (to make more stuff spawn) helps.<br/>

Just what do you gain by doing it the latter way that you<br/>
can&#39;t duplicate with tweaks to the former way?<br/>
