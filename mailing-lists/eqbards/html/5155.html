<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295437872">I totally agree. There is NO secret nerfing going on. Do you question when<br/>
you hit for max damage in melee 5 times in a row? Then why the big fuss over<br/>
some missed notes? It happens, I think they have a name for it, bad luck?<br/>
  It reminds me of the cleric&#39;s list not too long ago. After a patch that<br/>
nerfed their highest DD spell 10%, there was a lengthy thread about how<br/>
Verant was TESTING them! Yes, Verant was going to see how much they could<br/>
take away before  the clerics would say something :)<br/>
  So expect a cleric petition on EQVault in a few days, should we expect a<br/>
bard petition shortly after?<br/>

&gt; Ok overall I&#39;m pretty sure this whole silent nerfing thing is some of you<br/>
&gt; getting worked up into a paranoid frenzy.  I checked with my enchanter<br/>
&gt; friend and he thinks he might have fizzled all of 2 times last night, but<br/>
&gt; noted that after every patch the enchanter boards fill up with this same<br/>
&gt; paranoid nonsense that resist rates and fizzle rates have changed, and<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; running a few tests they&#39;re always around where they should be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to run some trials tonight, and I suggest before anyone else<br/>
&gt; makes<br/>
&gt; accusations of silent nerfing or any other wonderful conspiracies they do<br/>
&gt; the same.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And a note about the random number generator, it does -seem- it likes long<br/>
&gt; strings of failures in a row, but over time, it still comes up statiscally<br/>
&gt; correct.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Just to add one more glitch to the list...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t have the problem of missing notes that often, but when I do, it<br/>
&gt; &gt;seems that I miss a lot of them. The other night it took me 6-7 attempts<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;get Selo&#39;s going, which seems like an awful lot of bad random numbers<br/>
&gt; rolls<br/>
&gt; &gt;to get at one time. Luckily this was a non-combat situtation and it just<br/>
&gt; &gt;made the rest of my group ridicule me, but hey when you strum a drumstick<br/>
&gt; &gt;you get used to that sort of thing.<br/>
