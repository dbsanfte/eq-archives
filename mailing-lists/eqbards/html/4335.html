<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673429295">Someone mentioned this earlier and it caught my imagination.  The <br/>
     Bagpipes of death.  These puppies perhaps would increase the effect of <br/>
     damage and fear spells.  Hopefully a DD effect since I just can&#39;t get <br/>
     AOE damage spells not to cause my almost instant demise.  And the <br/>
     graphic (if they bothered) would be most amusing.  <br/>
     <br/>
     I remember watching a WWII movie showing the British landing at <br/>
     Normandy.  There they were, right in the middle with bullets whizzing <br/>
     and shells exploding, a group of Scottish bagpipers playing and <br/>
     marching right up the beach into German fire. Wonderful image! (and <br/>
     people say bards are pure fantasy,  humph)  Anyway, if they had a <br/>
     quest for magic bagpipes I wouldn&#39;t sleep till I owned my own.<br/>

It sure would be nice to have some more magic instruments in the game. After <br/>
much consideration my Most Desired Magic Instrument (tm) would be a regular <br/>
ol&#39; drum...but one that sticks with you when you die. You awaken in the <br/>
Arena, naked to the world, with 3 or so zones to cross...wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>
wonderful to have that drum sitting there in your inventory? No, we can&#39;t <br/>
bind, and I am happy with that, but at EXACTLY the time you could really <br/>
leverage your abilities to lessen the pain, blah, no drum. Sure, I keep one <br/>
in the bank for when I am bound to a city,  but often zoning to the bank to <br/>
get it is just not what I have patience for after dying... Just a thought, <br/>
one born of making level 18 five times this weekend :o)<br/>
