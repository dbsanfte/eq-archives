&gt;Lastly, I&#39;ve heard some say that using a 29th or higher cleric to res you <br/>
&gt;is the<br/>
&gt;answer.  But really, if that were true, nobody at all should get bind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This works for me. I&#39;ve been bound in the bank in Freeport since the cleric <br/>
I work with hit 29.  I&#39;ve died all over Norrath and all I have to do is <br/>
click yes and I&#39;m back at my corpse.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, my planes trip aside, it&#39;d been 3 levels since I&#39;d died. I <br/>
lost the bard hate thing about level 25 and even when I want bard hate to <br/>
kick in it doesn&#39;t (unless its low enough I can charm it).<br/>
<br/>
If you are on Sol Ro, send me a tell, maybe I could help in that regard.<br/>
