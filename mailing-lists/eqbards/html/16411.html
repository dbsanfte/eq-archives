<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938987133">We decided to play train crasher on our way through Black Burrow this<br/>
weekend also, what fun!<br/>
<br/>
My thurs group ( I am a cleric there) warrior and I (we&#39;re roomates)<br/>
were waiting for Beyond the Mat to start so we logged on and decided to<br/>
try the Langseax quest once (5 normal langs so far, good money, but not<br/>
the prize we&#39;ve been looking for).<br/>
<br/>
On our way to Halas, I zone into BB and here the required &quot;Train to<br/>
Zone!!!!&quot; shout.  I fire up Lullaby and see what happens...  You&#39;re<br/>
right talk about mass carnage!  There ended being about 3 seperate<br/>
groups of 4-6 killing all the sleeping gnolls (I din&#39;t see any sign of a<br/>
4 limit on Lullaby, seemed I had a LOT more than that sleeping).  My<br/>
warrior friend just stood back and butchered the runners (since the<br/>
youngins would get the xp anyway).  It took about 20 minutes for them to<br/>
get the zone clear, but no complaints (it was fun to feel powerful).<br/>
<br/>
Then about 45 minutes later, Erollsi Mar smiled on me and Frostbite led<br/>
us not to a naked Barbarian, but an armored one!  Wooohoo, 20 minutes<br/>
later, my roomate was auctioning off his Shiny Brass Halbred, and<br/>
challenging me to a duel to see his max damage on his new Langseax of<br/>
Wolves :)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
