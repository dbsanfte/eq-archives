25 is a mini-hell.  Most people don&#39;t notice it, but I&#39;d<br/>
estimate it took me about 70% longer to get through it.<br/>
<br/>
30 is the first well-known hell.<br/>
<br/>
At 31 you lose about a bubble per death (vs. about 1/4-1/3 at<br/>
30 and 32).  If you tend to have a high number of deaths per<br/>
level as I know many of you do, this can really screw you up.<br/>
Whereas before you were taking 5 steps forward and 2 steps<br/>
back for a net gain of 3 steps a night, at 31 this can turn<br/>
into 5 steps forward and 6 steps back for a net loss of 1 step<br/>
a night, even though you are gaining experience and dying at<br/>
the exact same rate as before.  I hear this holds true for all<br/>
hell-levels + 1.<br/>
