<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] New songs!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793668092">I saw a suggestion somewhere, for the new song.  Maybe it was here...anyway,<br/>
the suggestion was that a bard who&#39;s only using instruments and damage songs<br/>
probably doesn&#39;t really need to keep the mob targetted, and can therefore<br/>
keep the main tank targetted (assuming he&#39;s the only tank in the group) and<br/>
add this song in during the twist.  Shrug, just something different than<br/>
powerlevelling twinks.<br/>
