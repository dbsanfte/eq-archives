<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803904380"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You guys (and another guild I believe) beat us up to Hate <br/>
&gt; Monday (I hope no BP&#39;s dropped &lt;veg&gt;) But it was a good <br/>
&gt; night for DoK as we got three members epic items instead <br/>
&gt; of going to Hate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it was a horrid night... everyone dies a TON of times and lost <br/>
levels... there was also NO loot for the entire night. You are LUCKY <br/>
you missed Hate on Monday, Slyde.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, real story... there was only one bard in Hate on Monday (both <br/>
sides) and a Bard BP dropped in the other group. Since Onahoo was the <br/>
only one up there, he ran over and got it. Also... when DC dropped <br/>
the Mae, he had a Seven stringer... once again, it went to Onahoo...<br/>
<br/>
I, also, was not in Hate on Monday... Monday night was a &quot;make up&quot; <br/>
night with my wife because I played WAY too much over the weekend. <br/>
Last night was also a family night, so I missed that too...<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of last night, I was playing my magician, and saw quite a <br/>
few of you guildmates collecting in Freeport. Working on a Paladin <br/>
sword? I was going to offer to help, but knew no one, and you were <br/>
not online.<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
