it perfected. :-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hadn&#39;t played my bard since the 10 slot hotkey banks went live, but<br/>
&gt;decided to finally sit down & remap the keys & give my rogue a rest.  So I<br/>
&gt;get the hotkeys all mapped from using Numpad 7, 8, 4, 5, 1, & 2 to using<br/>
&gt;Numpad &quot;/&quot; through &quot;.&quot;  Then I create a bank with all my songs, a &quot;/g INC -<br/>
&gt;%target&quot; message, and an Off Hand slot to swap instruments.  Look up,<br/>
&gt;forward, and down got moved from Numpad 96&3 to Numpad 74&1.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That accomplished, I try to attack something.  I spot a Lion Matriarch,<br/>
&gt;blue to me at level 13, and try to hit it with one pulse of Bellow.  The<br/>
&gt;lioness wanders off unharmed while I figure out why I&#39;m suddenly staring at<br/>
&gt;my feet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I realize my error and reposition my hand a bit more to the left.  Then I<br/>
&gt;make my way towards a carrion spider and try to hit it with one pulse of<br/>
&gt;Bellow.  The spider wanders off unharmed while I try to figure out why I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;talking to myself.  I remind myself that Bellow has moved from slot 5 to<br/>
&gt;slot 9.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I run off to a safe corner and rehearse my battle setlist (Bellow, CoD,<br/>
&gt;Hymn) a couple times to make sure I know where my hands should be.  Then I<br/>
&gt;go looking for another mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I spot another spider and hit it with Bellow.  Yay!  I finally hit<br/>
&gt;something!  I restart Selo&#39;s and head to the zone edge.  I turn around and<br/>
&gt;attempt to switch hotkey banks to grab my mandolin out of inventory.  That<br/>
&gt;would be a shift 1, but my hand has gone back over to the old keys, so I<br/>
&gt;find myself staring at the sky.  I look forward again and try to hit Shift<br/>
&gt;1 again.  I inadvertently turn off numlock.  The spider is on me now and<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m attempting to sing while struggling with the hotkeys.  I soon discover<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve turned off Numlock, toggle it back, restart Selo&#39;s, and hit the zone.<br/>
&gt;No sense messing around - I knew I&#39;d botched that battle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After about a half hour of similar mishaps, I finally start killing things.<br/>
&gt;Yay!  Then a druid guildmate who&#39;s primary is a bard - and a good one -<br/>
&gt;asks to group.  I warn her of the difficulties I&#39;ve been having but she<br/>
&gt;assures me I&#39;ll do fine and tells me to start pulling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I find a spider and try to hit it with bellow, but instead tell the druid,<br/>
&gt;&quot;Inc - a carrion spider...Inc - a carrion spider&quot;  Said it twice because i<br/>
&gt;thought I was starting and stopping a song, see?  It wouldn&#39;t have been so<br/>
&gt;bad except in the time it took me to realize what I&#39;d done wrong the spider<br/>
&gt;hand wandered dangerously close to a gorge hound.  So I quickly scour the<br/>
&gt;area, find another spider and bring it back to the druid, who&#39;s scratching<br/>
&gt;her head wondering why it took so long to pull a spider.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I make that same mistake a few more times, and eventually she has to ask<br/>
&gt;whether I know multiple incoming messages are supposed to be an indication<br/>
&gt;of multiple mobs being pulled.  &lt;sigh&gt;  So much for making a good<br/>
&gt;impression.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Furthering my reputation as Newbie For Life, I turned numlock off 4 more<br/>
&gt;times over the next half hour.  If I managed to keep two songs up during<br/>
&gt;battle I was doing good.  But my druid friend stuck with me, and eventually<br/>
&gt;I started getting the hang of it again.  Yay! Three songs, almost four<br/>
&gt;stacked up at a time.  Pulls as fast and smooth as an expensive German car.<br/>
&gt;No more than a few seconds downtime between battles, and rarely that much.<br/>
&gt;Oh yeah, this is what being a bard is all about!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s when I notice I&#39;d been singing Elemental Rhythms against spiders all<br/>
&gt;night.  Heh, I used to have ER in slot one, PR in slot 3.  I cleverly<br/>
&gt;switched them when rearranging keys.  Oh how I blushed...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Evulia, singing 13 songs, all in the wrong key, Tunare<br/>
