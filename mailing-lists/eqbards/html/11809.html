It is part of my chanter&#39;s permanent armor. (Enchanters like charisma)<br/>

&gt;Well, I am getting better with charm ;p  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I am really serious, I will swap in all my cha stuff (crude <br/>
&gt;stein, drosco<br/>
&gt;amulet, silk evening tunic), remember to dequip my StoW, beg a SoW or have<br/>
&gt;someone sing Selos.  I have not actually used all my extra cha <br/>
&gt;stuff since I<br/>
&gt;got my guise and that might really help.  I could try for a cha <br/>
&gt;buff from an<br/>
&gt;enchanter but if there is an enchanter - wtf am I doing the charming for? </span></blockquote></div>
