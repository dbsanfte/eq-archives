&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I learned something new today.  I was always under the impression that<br/>
&gt; lambent stones could only be acquired by killing a giant or griffon.  Never<br/>
&gt; knew you could buy them from NPCs.  Can someone list the known locations<br/>
&gt; where NPCs sell them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>

&gt; &gt; Another thing.  I was wanting a stone the other night for my last piece of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lambent.  The zone was camped and I couldn&#39;t find ONE giant, much less<br/>
&gt; &gt; two.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I /auc&#39;d for a stone and some jackass wanted 100pp.  I said &quot;Hey guy, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; buy one from the INN in Rathe Mts., a 60 second run, for 48pp.&quot;  He called<br/>
&gt; &gt; me a liar of course, so I ran to the Inn and bought it for 48pp.  <br/>
