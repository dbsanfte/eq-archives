<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080175162">I spent a couple nights in Beholder&#39;s Maze and found another<br/>
use for the lullaby (L15 song).  Every so often, an evil eye<br/>
(or the Lord evil eye) would get pulled near the zone border<br/>
and charm people before it was killed (the charm lasts despite<br/>
the death of the charmer).  These charmed people would then<br/>
run around attacking everyone else.  You don&#39;t want to hurt<br/>
them because they&#39;re not in control of what they do, but OTOH<br/>
it can be a pain just standing there soaking up the damage.<br/>
<br/>
What to do?  I just started up my lullaby and put all the<br/>
charmed people to sleep, and everyone else got busy healing<br/>
themselves.  (The charmee hitting sit over and over works too,<br/>
but in one case the charmed person went linkdead.)  They wake<br/>
up every now and then and swing at you, but usually go right<br/>
back to sleep.  Verant in all their wisdom made it much easier<br/>
for mobs to stun than for players to do so, so it was actually<br/>
easier to do this against players than monsters.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s little things like this, doing stuff that nobody else can<br/>
do, that really make me like the bard.  :-)<br/>
