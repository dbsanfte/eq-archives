There is no known current use for LotGP.  (It used to be used in a quest but<br/>
that got changed some time ago.)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you sell some thing to a merch, you can sometimes buy it back.  You<br/>
may need to buy a lot of stuff from them but they do have a pool of items<br/>
that they got from players.  If you keep buying from that pool, eventually<br/>
you can buy your item back. Might be a whole lot easier to get a lev 50<br/>
druid to help you get a new one.<br/>

p.s. has anyone seen Lord Grimlot recently? I have tried clearing the skelly<br/>
camp in SK in an effort to get him to spawn but no luck.  Does he only spwan<br/>
if the quest is initiated?<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. Lord Grim used to be part of the old LotGP quest or was that just a<br/>
rumor - anyhow that&#39;s the connection.<br/>

&gt; Last night I sold my Lute of the Gypsy princess to a vendor for 3pp. Damn<br/>
&gt; game, that was a gift from my guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have heard rumors that this Lute doesn&#39;t do anything good, can anyone<br/>
&gt; confirm this for me? Might make me feel a little better.<br/>
