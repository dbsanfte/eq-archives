seen (excluding the multi-hour and multi-day respawns) is only<br/>
40 minutes.  In fact, most of the ones your level are like<br/>
15-20 minutes.<br/>

&gt; than 4 times a week and those are the ones who can solo easily.  Once a week<br/>
&gt; is the most often we get more than three guildmembers together.  From our<br/>
&gt; experience the new rules will not increase our access as casual players, but<br/>
&gt; exactly the opposite.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like your problem is you don&#39;t know enough people<br/>
you&#39;re willing to group with for a shot at one of these named<br/>
mobs.  The access is there, you&#39;re just unwilling to take<br/>
advantage of it because of whom you choose to group with.  <br/>
It&#39;s a variant of the problem solo players complain about -<br/>
that they can&#39;t really kill most of the named spawns solo<br/>
unless it&#39;s way green to them.  This is a grouping game.  If<br/>
your grouping is sub-par, you&#39;re going to miss out no matter<br/>
the rules.<br/>
