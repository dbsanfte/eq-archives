<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788531328">Ok, this may sound silly, but I&#39;ve actually had people ask this, and wonder<br/>
about the &quot;REAL&quot; definition of juggling/twisting/mixing/stacking....<br/>
<br/>
When you juggle, you start the first song. Ok easy, so far.<br/>
WHEN do you start the second?<br/>
Do you start the second immediately when the icon for that song comes up? Do<br/>
you start it immediately when you see the expected text in the textbox? (If<br/>
it sounds stupid, I&#39;ve actually seen so many times where the icon does NOT<br/>
go up at the same time as the words appear in the text box). Or do you click<br/>
a song, don&#39;t wait for anything and click the next song right away? Do you<br/>
start the first song, and wait to start the second until the graphics for<br/>
the first song take effect? (i.e. the little blue sprinkles for Hymn, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Who knows, maybe I have been doing it wrong all this time (smile)<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Whoever mentioned &quot;Mixing&quot;, I like that! It fits perfectly into &quot;music&quot;<br/>
terminology, and is short and easy, and doesn&#39;t sound as silly as<br/>
&quot;twisting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
