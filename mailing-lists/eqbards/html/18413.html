We petitioned, and the guide said if a sarnak even looked at you, you<br/>
got on its aggro list -- and thus got faction hits<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;These ghost faction hits happened to me non-stop on E&#39;ci this past weekend.<br/>
&gt;All were negative Mistmoore hits so didn&#39;t really bother me too much.  I<br/>
&gt;also saw non-stop messages that nearby mobs were casting spells even though<br/>
&gt;they weren&#39;t showing up on tracking.  This was in the Dreadlands near the<br/>
&gt;tunnel to FV.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One more question:  Does everyone get random faction hits in ROK?  The<br/>
&gt;whole time I was there I was getting random faction hits.  I assumed its<br/>
&gt;was a bard bug, but the rest of party was getting them too (not at the<br/>
&gt;same time, though)<br/>
&gt;--<br/>
&gt;We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
