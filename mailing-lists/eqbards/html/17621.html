<b>Subject:</b> Not sure, but here&#39;s my guess for the new 45th level song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918359135">This song looks like an AWESOME candidate to twist in with our Charm tactic.  However it comes awful late to be truely useful.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Charm Mob<br/>
2)  Haste/buff mob w/1 song<br/>
3)  Selo&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
Rinse, Repeat<br/>
<br/>
Even if the NPC your &#39;pet&#39; is taking down is lower level this song will probably give it enough of a boost to win, almost every time.<br/>
<br/>
I see a use, albeit a limited one.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else notice that we&#39;re going to need ANOTHER charm upgrade somewhere in the 50&#39;s?  39th will only take us to 49th level npc&#39;s.<br/>
