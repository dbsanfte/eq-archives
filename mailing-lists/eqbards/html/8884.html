&gt; &gt; Can you safely get to the area where the Solusek Mage and Champion spawn <br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt; &gt; singing the Invis song or are there mobs along the path that can See <br/>
&gt;Invis?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on Solusek A, having spent a total of one <br/>
&gt;night there, but we did<br/>
&gt;have to do a corpse recovery and I can say that any of the goblins who had <br/>
&gt;&quot;Solusek&quot; in front of<br/>
&gt;their names seem to be able to see invis.  (Which led to more corpse <br/>
&gt;recoveries - ouch)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can probably invis part of the way in, then fight the rest of the way, <br/>
&gt;though it&#39;s not that<br/>
&gt;hard to just clear the whole path.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jyzan&#39;s right from my experience, even the non-casting Solusek Goblin or <br/>
Solusek Champions see right thru my invis song. Also have found it easiest <br/>
to kill these things using stacked DoTs and Hymn. I STILL need the boots and <br/>
vambraces, after 7 hours of camping it, killing every solusek gobbo from <br/>
king room to the room with double doors. =&#92;<br/>
