<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although I get harrassed by other bards in my guild for not having<br/>
&gt; Diamondines, I just don&#39;t feel that the stats are that great *for a bard*<br/>
&gt; (AC 2, STR 3, HP 12).  Definitely great earrings for a proper tank though.<br/>
&gt; I currently have Opallines from Unrest that are AC 2, CHA 5 and a jeweler<br/>
&gt; made STR/INT pair that I swap out when I want to feel butch.  But come on...<br/>
&gt; STR just isn&#39;t that important for a bard, and even with two Diamondines you<br/>
&gt; only add 24 HPs.  24 HPs is almost insignificant fighting most of the stuff<br/>
&gt; I fight (i.e. a Spite Golem that doubles on me for 130).  So to me it&#39;s down<br/>
&gt; to just the 4 AC points, the same as I get from my Opallines, along with 10<br/>
&gt; CHA points which are (should be :) significant to a lot of our songs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I welcome arguments in favor of Diamondines.<br/>

<br/>
They are more rare and they LOOK COOL!  I wear two =).<br/>
<br/>
I also have a platinum diamond wedding ring (yes, from my game husband) which I like<br/>
to flash around at dragon raids =).  Fire opal on the other hand, also a wedding<br/>
ring.<br/>
<br/>
It just feels nice to have pretty jewelry!<br/>
