<div id="ygrps-yiv-365971104">I recently got a new PC.  It IS like playing a totally new game now and I<br/>
was finally able to twist 4 songs.  :)  But one of the changes I noticed<br/>
with this PC is for the worse.  Actually two changes are, but I think I can<br/>
live with the fact that everywhere I go I hear women screaming, bears<br/>
roaring, wisps whizzing, etc.  I guess that&#39;s supposed to make you feel<br/>
like you&#39;re in a zone full of dead bodies and monsters.  Bit nerve racking<br/>
though, and I can no longer track by ear.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, that&#39;s the problem I can learn to live with.  What&#39;s killing me<br/>
now is, I THINK, lag.   See, lag spikes on my old PC basically just made<br/>
movements slow and choppy.  What&#39;s happening now is my screen completely<br/>
locks up for about 20 seconds, during that time I&#39;ll hear about 5 seconds<br/>
of the me piercing something repeatedly, followed by 5ish seconds of me<br/>
screaming in agony repeatedly, followed by 5 seconds of the mob<br/>
barking/growling/etc, and so on.  It&#39;s like the client is playing all the<br/>
sound effects of the battle in order of effect rather than chronological.<br/>
And I can do NOTHING while this is going on.<br/>
<br/>
I tried going back to all my old PCs settings (no particles, about a 15&#39;<br/>
clip plane, most chatting off, etc) but if it helped any, it only made<br/>
these lag spikes less frequent.  It didn&#39;t make them any more manageable.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I&#39;m calling these lag spikes for lack of a better explanation.<br/>
Since the screen stops updating for such a long time I don&#39;t know what the<br/>
status bar would be showing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any insight on this?  Is this what lag is &quot;supposed&quot; to look<br/>
like?<br/>
<br/>
My new PC is a 1GHz P3, with 128 RAM & 64 video RAM.  (Nice toy, eh?  I<br/>
thought so &lt;g&gt;) Old PC, if I recall correctly, was a 200Mhz P2, with 64 RAM<br/>
& 32 video RAM.  Both use 56K modems.<br/>
<br/>
On an unrelated note, Talies, sorry to hear your out of the game, glad to<br/>
hear your staying with the list.<br/>
<br/>
And on another unrelated note, Thex, how&#39;d the Naggy raid go last night?<br/>
