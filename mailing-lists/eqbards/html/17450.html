<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659525317"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1) It&#39;s pretty clear that we all don&#39;t want Verant (or anyone<br/>
&gt; else) snooping<br/>
&gt; around in such things as Internet directories et al.  If I recall<br/>
&gt; correctly - the impression that this was being done - was from a<br/>
&gt; post from a<br/>
&gt; Necro board of a log of program that claimed they were reading this.  Has<br/>
&gt; anyone here verified this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Smedly claimed that this was false...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Smedly is probably correct.  The VAST majority of EQ players are kids.  At<br/>
the time that the poll was taken (roughly 2pm EST the entire United States<br/>
adult population of EQ (or at least the vast majority of it) was at work.<br/>
Thus, unable to participate in the Poll.  Since there were likely kids<br/>
already coming home from school and at home when he released the numbers<br/>
(around 4-5pm EST) the only people who were likely polled were teens,<br/>
college students and grade schoolers.  All of whom are very likely to:<br/>
<br/>
Not Care and thus choose &quot;Yes&quot; on Mr. Smedley&#39;s Poll.<br/>
<br/>
I personally would like to see his Poll results as of 8pm EST *(when they<br/>
yanked the poll down by the way, BEFORE Prime time, when most adults play)*<br/>
<br/>
The Poll, to be accurate, would have had to be left up for at least 48<br/>
hours.  So, no, I don&#39;t doubt the numbers they got from their little poll.<br/>
But the poll, as demonstrated above, is inaccurate due to the sampling<br/>
taken.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Smedly claimed all they did (and I thought Kevin Crawford<br/>
&gt; verified this)<br/>
&gt; is that they run a Win32API call to see what active process were<br/>
&gt; and what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; in memory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If this is all Verant is doing - I&#39;m not so sure I have a problem<br/>
&gt; with this.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want them reading my hard drive - there is a chance for<br/>
&gt; proprietary<br/>
&gt; info.  Hypothetically there&#39;s a chance that (say you had a word processor<br/>
&gt; doc running) that proprietary info is in memory - but that&#39;s kind of a<br/>
&gt; stretch.  Plus - if you were really concerned about it - you<br/>
&gt; should just be<br/>
&gt; careful to shut everything down before starting EQ (I do this anyway to<br/>
&gt; conserve memory).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious what others think about this.  Again - no scanning of file -<br/>
&gt; simply checking memory and active processes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a problem with any of my data being &quot;sampled&quot; by a 3rd party whom I<br/>
have not given permission to.  Furthermore a 3rd party who then transmits my<br/>
data back to themselves in clear text. ;).  They could easily have solved<br/>
this, as someone else posted, by simply having the client shut down if it<br/>
found a problem and transmit a message to VI stating that the client found<br/>
illegal software on the system.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What&#39;s kind of silly about this - is how hard is it to change the name of<br/>
&gt; the program?  Couldn&#39;t you even code the program to generate a random<br/>
&gt; process name everytime you ran?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, easily<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And isn&#39;t there a REALLY simple solution to thsi?  Couldn&#39;t Verant encrypt<br/>
&gt; their packets?  Perhaps this additional overhead would negatively impact<br/>
&gt; performance - but I&#39;d think if they are clever enough they could come up<br/>
&gt; with something that would make it really hard for these programs.<br/>
&gt; Especially since they could subtly change the algorhtym ever time they<br/>
&gt; patch..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They shouldn&#39;t be sending the data back.  That&#39;s illegal and even Violates<br/>
the laws of California.  Which, now that I think about it, is probably the<br/>
real reason they &quot;chose&quot; to stop scanning systems.<br/>
