<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892847054">I read some of the posts on that thread.  Will read some of the others when<br/>
I get a chance.  <br/>
<br/>
Still don&#39;t agree with it though.  I think Abashi totally missed the point<br/>
in regards to his casual gamer comment.  I have no problem with the fact<br/>
that people who have more time to play than me will level faster and have<br/>
time to camp for good items.  Abashi stated they should get rewarded (i.e.<br/>
really nice items) for the time they invest.  Agreed.  But when the<br/>
expansion comes out, the new zones will/should contain the new high level<br/>
mobs/items (geared toward the 50+ player).  Vox/Nagafen  and plane loot<br/>
should remain geared towards the 45-50 level players (of course they can add<br/>
new dragons in the expansion geared towards the 50+ players).  However, if<br/>
Verant increases the toughness of Vox/Nagafen/Fear/Hate to where 45-50<br/>
players are too low to survive, then players like me get hosed.  Those of<br/>
you currently 45+ are getting to have fun on dragon/planes raids now.  When<br/>
the expansion comes out, the players currently 45- should get the same<br/>
opportunity.    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve continued to play EQ ever since April because one of my goals was to be<br/>
a part of a successful dragon raid (i.e. one where I don&#39;t die).  Its not<br/>
the loot so much but the opportunity to do something in the game I&#39;ve never<br/>
done before that gives me enjoyment.  Thats the reason I&#39;ve been going on<br/>
Kedge raids recently with a bunch of high level players.  I had never gone<br/>
to Kedge before until last week.  I happened to get lucky and get some nice<br/>
loot while there but if I had never gotten one piece of loot I still would<br/>
have had a lot of fun.  If Verant makes changes to dragons after the<br/>
expansion to where level 45-50 players are not capable of defeating a<br/>
dragon, then I will most likely hang up my spurs.<br/>

&gt; Abashi responded to a similar question today. In a nutshell, if you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t play 12 hours a day, the high end stuff isnt for you, and that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; they way they planned it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think you missed the point he was trying to make.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; A lot of EQ players, for whatever reason, are not high enough level yet<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go on a dragon raid.  As it stands right now on most servers, you have<br/>
&gt; to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; 45+ to get invited on a dragon raid.  By the time you get to that level<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few months down the road, the expansion will likely be out.  Lets say in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; expansion Verant raises the level cap to 75.  So by the time us non 45+<br/>
&gt; &gt; people get to 45th level, the current level 50s will be fastly<br/>
&gt; approaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; 75.  You have to assume that a lot of these 75 people will still go on<br/>
&gt; &gt; dragon raids.  If it takes 24 level 45+ players now to kill a dragon,<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; many level 75s will it take?  Once again you have to assume Verant will<br/>
&gt; &gt; upgrade the dragons because out of X people on a dragon raid, Y people<br/>
&gt; &gt; should die.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think what Matt was implying is this is what he thinks will happen.<br/>
&gt; So<br/>
&gt; &gt; what does that mean for us currently below 45th level? By the time we<br/>
&gt; get to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 45th, people organizing raids will increase the minimum level to attend<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; dragon raid raid, i.e. new minimum level is 55th.  End result is now<br/>
&gt; that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; are 45th level, we&#39;re still to low to go on a dragon raid.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the best way Verant can solve this problem for those of us<br/>
&gt; currently<br/>
&gt; &gt; not high enough to go on a dragon raid (if they even consider it a<br/>
&gt; problem),<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that once the expansion comes out, put a maximum level limit to zone<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; Permafrost or Sol B.  Kind of like a reverse Plane level limit.  If they<br/>
&gt; &gt; limit entering those zones to level 50s and below , then they don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; worry about level 75s coming in and easily killing a dragon.  They also<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to worry about continually making dragons tougher.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, be happy!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Seriously,  do what I do when you see posts that disturb you: delete<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Right now, you have a lot of monsters to fight that are close to your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Deal with them now.  Play the game &#39;one level at a time&#39; and enjoy.<br/>
&gt; There<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is nothing to be gained by worrying about stuff that is far away and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unknown.  The dragon&#39;s you fight will be different from the ones that<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fight today just as they are different from the first ones that were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on all of the servers.  By the time you get there, there will be new<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weapons, new spells and a history of tips, tricks, and tales from<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have gone before.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Verant _knows_ that they are in the entertainment business.  My take<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they _will_ keep &quot;raising the bar&quot; on certain zones/monsters to<br/>
&gt; prevent<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from being &quot;farmed&quot; and provide challenge to the high levels.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they may &quot;road block&quot; a zone or mob for one reason or another.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they will make mistakes.  But any time there is a change in the status<br/>
&gt; quo<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you will hear complaints.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some of what you said was my point, Naggy is upgraded, Vox is<br/>
&gt; upgraded,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Innoruk (he&#39;s the one with DT, right?) is upgraded.  They did this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because they were dying too easily.  This is all fine and good for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who have been there before, and have plane/dragon equipment<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plane/dragon experience. (Actually its not, but at least you had a<br/>
&gt; shot<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at it)  By the time we get there, there will be no chance.  We will<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be lvl 50 before expansion, I cant imagine what Verant is going to<br/>
&gt; do to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all those guys then...<br/>
