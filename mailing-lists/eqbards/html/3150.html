<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961508862">Prior to 12th level I used it for luring only.  I figured the 1 or 2 silver <br/>
wasted on a throwing knife was worth it, esp in crowded zones like Crushbone <br/>
and Greater Feydark.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 2. Perhaps there is a way - and I just missed it, do we ever get to <br/>
&gt;weild<br/>
&gt; &gt; one weapon and an instrument?  I could have sworn I saw a higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; level bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing just this once, but could never get it to equip. I figured<br/>
&gt; &gt; I might be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to do this once I got dual wield, but if there is one that lets us <br/>
&gt;do<br/>
&gt; &gt; it, I&#39;ve not found it yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I used to get questions about this all the time when I carried a mino axe<br/>
&gt;and a drum or mandolin.  You CAN carry a weapon and an instrument at the<br/>
&gt;same time, the problem is you can&#39;t use the weapon in a conventional way.<br/>
&gt;Before I got dual wield I would put my mino axe in my range weapon slot and<br/>
&gt;my intrument in my secondary mellee slot.  This gave the appearance that I<br/>
&gt;was carrying a weapon and an instrument.  Too bad the only way I could use<br/>
&gt;the weapon would be to throw it at that point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On a related note, have any of you bards used throwing skill at all? I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;found it to be a collosal waste of money so far, but maybe I am doing it<br/>
&gt;wrong. :)<br/>
