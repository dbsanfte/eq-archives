<div id="ygrps-yiv-566133786">Ummm, you will quickly achieve a poor reputation for yourself if you<br/>
continue to sell moonstones for 10pp each.  This is not a new item, and it<br/>
is not really rare either...and yes it can be used for a quest, but the<br/>
rewards for the quest are no where near 10pp each.  You got lucky that time,<br/>
but people will catch on.<br/>

Ok so you must like spoilers:) I am a bard of teh 15 circle of enlightenment<br/>
and i did the gnoll fang quest in qeynos. Hey they were sitting in the bank<br/>
collecting dust. I was expecting to receive a few cp but to my surprise fer<br/>
every fang turned in you get a moonstone. Now this is a new item to me and<br/>
all the jewelers in town at the time. I did not let them know how to obtain<br/>
because aminly , THEY WERE NOT BARDS heheheheh. But i sold two fer 10 plat a<br/>
piece. Not bad fer killing a gnoll. If any body knows what these can ya let<br/>
me know:)<br/>
