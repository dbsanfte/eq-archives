This is the dark elf necro or sk or whatever in West Commons right?<br/>
<br/>
I know for a fact that I was able to obtain the note for the Thex Mallet<br/>
quest from him by charming him and then hailing him and giving him the key<br/>
phrase.  Lament may work for this as well, let us know how it goes.<br/>

&gt; Anyone care to comment on my observation that Lament song <br/>
&gt; will change the<br/>
&gt; faction con?  E.g.: I lament a Spectre and it goes from blue <br/>
&gt; scowling to<br/>
&gt; blue indifferent.  I have done this several times.  Not being <br/>
&gt; a true tester,<br/>
&gt; I cant say if it&#39;s every time but it was strange enough that <br/>
&gt; I took note of<br/>
&gt; it more than one time.  And walked up to the spectre very <br/>
&gt; close to make sure<br/>
&gt; there was no reduced agro range.  The was 0 agro range and he conned<br/>
&gt; indifferent.  No, I did not hail him and ask for a quest but <br/>
&gt; maybe next time<br/>
&gt; I will.  And next time I see Kisdean Gixx I am trying this on <br/>
&gt; him because I<br/>
&gt; know he has a quest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Next:  /auctions Trading one-quarter bub exp for Imbrued Greaves!<br/>

&gt; Yes, we took a little jaunt to the Plane of Hate.  Not too <br/>
&gt; long into the<br/>
&gt; expedition we dropped a scorn banshee and all of a sudden <br/>
&gt; peeps were saying:<br/>
&gt; &quot;Gratz Sylly!&quot;  &quot;Woo hoo Sylly!&quot;  And I am like &quot;uhh what?&quot; <br/>
&gt; So they tell me<br/>
&gt; to loot it and WOW!!!<br/>
