<b>Subject:</b> Why did you start a Bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-78013918">I&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the Bardic class.  When I first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find their corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could run faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible once you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>
<br/>
So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>
