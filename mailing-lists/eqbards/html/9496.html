I have yet to find a gate in, though we found wht we think is a gate out.<br/>
Only way in is via your friendly wizard friend and an expensive regent.<br/>
When you first gate in, the area is safe, nothing will attack you. This is<br/>
much, much different the pof, and imo makes the poh much safer. Spawn is<br/>
also faster than 12 hours, unlike the pof, WE THINK. Some funky things<br/>
going on with tracking and we are not positive. We have killed quite a few<br/>
things so far, and are fairly deep in. Right now we just got slaughtered<br/>
when our fearless puller brought one too many fetid fiends (well not fetid<br/>
fiends, they look the same, have a different name that i keep forgetting,<br/>
spent far too long in the pof :) AND the maestro of rancor. The maestro had<br/>
a mace, im hoping the bardic mace of ultimate slaying :), hopefully we will<br/>
find out later heh, right now we just finished corpse retrieval and are<br/>
rebuffing. <br/>

we found a kick ass enchanters robe that looks like cryosilk but is deep<br/>
blue (bleh imo). Stats are incredible, will show up on the spoiler sights i<br/>
am sure. Found a crappy wizard wand, and we found the kiraikuei (zombie<br/>
monks) drop indocilite, the forsaken revanants dropped the enchanters robe,<br/>
and the clerics of innoruk drop, surprise, ethereal armour. Thats all i can<br/>
think of for now, we are attemping to locate the maestro since he is no<br/>
longer back at his organ anymore.</div>
