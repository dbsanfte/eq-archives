<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-62450927">Although nobody else has asked this question (and perhaps I should keep <br/>
my mouth shut), I&#39;d like to know what it tells us that, three weeks <br/>
before the expansion release, they&#39;re &quot;brainstorming&quot; possible Bard songs <br/>
and asking us for suggestions?  Kinda sad.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to suggest/comment on new bard songs; a lot of the ideas <br/>
here are good, and I have a hard time deciding what to suggest given that <br/>
none of us has any idea what kind of MOBs a level 51-60 Bard might be <br/>
facing.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you say the following in your letter:<br/>
1)  Given our small melee-based skill set, our lack of crits, etc., our <br/>
bad defense, our relatively under-powered high level armor (in AC), our <br/>
low hit points, and our lack of pets, our melee component is roughly 1/5 <br/>
the melee of a pure melee class.  That means that our casting should be <br/>
about 80% as good as a pure caster.  In some circumstances, it should be <br/>
clearly better.<br/>
<br/>
2)  They seem to believe that our songs should be underpowered <br/>
because 1) we do not use mana, and 2) we can sing party-wide songs.  This <br/>
does not compensate for the very short duration of our song effects, nor <br/>
the fact that we can keep at most three effects going at once.<br/>
<br/>
We were asked to list the things we&#39;d like to see them &quot;fix&quot;.  They <br/>
should be referred to the Bard Petition on the Gameplay board, and to the <br/>
Lullaby thread.  My list:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Lullaby.  When a level 43 Enchanter can mez 17 kobolds, with a less <br/>
than 10% resist rate, and a level 45 bard gets resist rates of 70% <br/>
against the same, this song stinks.  It doesn&#39;t do what they say it <br/>
should do; even if it did, it should be better than that.  If they don&#39;t <br/>
want us to stop gigantic trains, they should shrink the AE radius of the <br/>
song, not make it useless.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Pixie Strike appears (to me) to have the same resist problem.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Numerous songs are instrument-based, but instruments appear to have <br/>
no effect on the song at all.  Lullaby and Psalms in particular.<br/>
<br/>
4)  Our songs don&#39;t scale up in proportion to either PC or NPC <br/>
HPs/damage dealing.  They should.<br/>
<br/>
5)  Is there a reason that the Psalms don&#39;t stack with each other?  This <br/>
makes them so over-specialized as to be useless.<br/>
<br/>
6)  For multiple effect songs:  if they are going to cut the power of <br/>
each component in half (so it doesn&#39;t take away from the parent class&#39;s <br/>
abilities), and then cut it by N (where N is the number of component <br/>
effects), the MOBs should NOT get full resists against each component, <br/>
any one of which causes the whole song to fail.  Either a component <br/>
should work if the specific resist is failed against that component, or <br/>
MOBs should get a single &quot;average&quot; resist check.  Multiple component <br/>
anti-MOB songs are pretty worthless now.<br/>
<br/>
7)  If a party-based song has multiple components, they need to keep in <br/>
mind:  1) not every party member benefits, 2) if our songs have stacking <br/>
conflicts with a lot of different spell/buff effects, the songs have to <br/>
be pretty strong to make them useful, 3) we can only keep up three song <br/>
effects at once.<br/>
<br/>
Just my take on it.<br/>
