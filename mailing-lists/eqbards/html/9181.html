<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678763915">Yep I have encountered this.  Generally the people who do this have<br/>
significantly more down time than I do (mine is nearly zero) so I usually<br/>
just wander off to somewhere else immediately.  I can then come back a<br/>
little later and voila!, the whole camp is there again and the guy looking<br/>
for the choice mob is staring at it and its buddies.  I then lament the<br/>
others, kill the choice mob and start to wander off again.  They quickly get<br/>
the point generally and ask me to stick around and help them but agree to<br/>
give me first choice on any mob that spawns.  The few people I have run into<br/>
who don&#39;t have the sense to do this when they otherwise could not &quot;break&quot;<br/>
the spawn I usually just leave to their fate and move on.  I imagine this<br/>
will get worse though as I go up in levels.<br/>

&gt; Lament is the best song you get other than Selo&#39;s until you are 11th<br/>
level.<br/>
&gt; It will allow you to easily solo critters characters 5 levels higher than<br/>
&gt; you just look at because they can&#39;t take 3 at once.  It allowed me to sol<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; the bandit camp in Lesser Faydark 4 levels before anyone else I ever saw<br/>
&gt; there.  No one else could handle the multiple spawns they would have to<br/>
&gt; face, but I could easily pull one out at a time and make boocou plat off<br/>
the<br/>
<br/>
Be forewarned, after you break a camp using Lament and have<br/>
spaced the spawns out, other people will arrive and demand<br/>
that you share with them.  Normally I don&#39;t have a problem<br/>
with this, but lately Lower Guk seems to be crawling with<br/>
soloers who run in while you&#39;re resting and pick off the prize<br/>
mobs.<br/>
