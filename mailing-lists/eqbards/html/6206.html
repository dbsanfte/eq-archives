<b>Subject:</b> Question /new to the list <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-563454264">Hi.  I stumbled upon this list and I&#39;m so glad I found it. I wish I had known about it sooner.  <br/>
<br/>
I am Telania, prior 15th lvl bard lady.::pouts::  I died shortly after hitting my new mark in HighPass.. (them dumb Orcs).  I was thinking of heading to Unrest with my RL hubby who is a 14th lvl WE Warrior.  But after reading about Unrest I dont&#39; think we&#39;re ready.  Sounds like we need to mature just a tad bit more.. =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY, now that i&#39;ve side tracked.. where is a good spot for my lvl to be?  I&#39;ve taken other suggestions like one, <br/>
<br/>
&quot;go to kerra isle! Good loot and easy&quot;. uh, They like forgot to mention Trains.  Died quiet harshly I might add. eh<br/>
<br/>
So, I will ask my brethen.. HELP?! hehe <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? <br/>
<br/>
Any and all would be appriecated.<br/>
<br/>
thank you <br/>
