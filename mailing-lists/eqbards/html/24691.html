<div id="ygrps-yiv-609674512">This just in from McAfee and other virus-detection agencies:<br/>
<br/>
A virus, labeled &quot;VBS/SST.gen@MM&quot; or &quot;Homepage&quot; has been discovered, and <br/>
rated as a serious threat by Internet security professionals, and has <br/>
already caused serious outbreaks in Asia and Europe.  Officials from <br/>
various reporting agencies estimate that this virus will infiltrate more <br/>
than the Anna Kournikova virus (which hit over 500,000 computers in February.)<br/>
<br/>
It may arrive in an email message containing the following information:<br/>
Subject: Homepage<br/>
Body: Hi! You&#39;ve got to see this page! It&#39;s really cool ;0)<br/>
File Attachment: homepage.HTML.vbs<br/>
Attachment: homepage.HTML.vbs<br/>
It may open up &quot;adult&quot; webpages.<br/>
<br/>
This virus is detected as &quot;VBS/SST.gen@MM&quot; by McAfee&#39;s Virus Shield, update <br/>
4123 (which all of you should have running actively on your computer), and <br/>
propagates only through Microsoft Outlook. It sends itself -- as an e-mail <br/>
attachment -- to all addresses listed in an infected user&#39;s address book. <br/>
Then it tries to open at random a number of pornographic Web sites using <br/>
Internet Explorer, according to Trend Micro Inc. It also deletes the sent <br/>
emails to avoid detection.<br/>
