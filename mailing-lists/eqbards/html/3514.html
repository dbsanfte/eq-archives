2hp to 1 mana point.  So the extra hp provides then with a significant<br/>
increase in mana.  There is spell for Shamans that also do the samething.<br/>
Eventually at the higher levels when your casters get a manastone, they<br/>
will ask you to twist hymm and clarity to significantly increase their<br/>
mana recovery.<br/>
