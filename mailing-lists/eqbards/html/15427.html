<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350955949">Was wondering if there is a good place for me to solo at 35th level?  Spent<br/>
four hours in Sol A last night in a party and killed a ton of blue goblins.<br/>
I got maybe 3/4 bar of EXP.  The camp was safe but actually pretty boring.<br/>
I&#39;m willing to take a risk soloing if it will help me get out of 35th.   I&#39;m<br/>
thinking about the only place for me to solo at 35 is Rathe Mtns charming<br/>
giants against one another.  Anyone got a better suggestion.  Would it just<br/>
be better to join a group in one of the dungeons or kill ogre bouncers?<br/>
