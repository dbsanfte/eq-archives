<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440796789">I am inconvenienced only in that we were theoretically limited to one song<br/>
per level and I don&#39;t get one at that level due to 7% of the people.  If<br/>
they add in another song at the level that is useful, problem solved.  My<br/>
whole point is DDD is pathetic.  Pillar of Frost can be chain cast 7 times<br/>
by a 51st level wizard for far more effect.<br/>

So why should you object if there is a pvp slanted song in our arsenal?  so<br/>
there&#39;s a song in there that you don&#39;t personally use.  you aren&#39;t<br/>
inconvenienced<br/>
by this song being in existence.</div>
