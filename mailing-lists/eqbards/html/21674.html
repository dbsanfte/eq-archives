<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877557648">Maybe they&#39;ve been nerfed since. I did indeed sit and chant everything in <br/>
the cells to death, repeatedly and they never moved. *shrug*.<br/>
<br/>
I did this about 3 weeks ago and all 3 of them were chained. The two on the <br/>
left could move to the door, but couldn&#39;t strike very far beyond it.<br/>
<br/>
I admit, I was surprised it wasn&#39;t always camped 24/7 as they were indeed <br/>
sitting ducks, except that casters were extremely dangerous. Also, the <br/>
wandering placeholder did make it a bit tougher.<br/>

&gt;Stuff in the cells are chained?  They sure didn&#39;t have any trouble chasing<br/>
&gt;me halfway to the zone before I outran them.  I hope you were kidding.<br/>
