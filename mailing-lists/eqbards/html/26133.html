<div id="ygrps-yiv-143478047">Hi Folks! <br/>
  New member here, wanted to say hi, introduce myself and also share a bit on what I have been working on. <br/>
   <br/>
  My name is Donald Adams, Im a scentific researcher. Been working on a project for the last 7 years, a significant spin off of which has resulted in the novel discovery of new curious sound frequencies which appear to be able to possibly affect DNA. Specifically, I strongly suspect both activation and repair may be possible.  I am particularly interested in how gamers may be affected in areas such as response time, hand eye coordination and correct decision making under stress.  Gamers can provide real time, actual feedback as to whether these frequencies are working because if they are then they should notice fast, dramatic and concrete improvements in their performance.  When that happens, I&#39;d like to be informed of it, this is very helpful to me in the collection of data from various domains.  I suspect that DNA is being &#39;activated&#39; and repaired with these sound frequencies.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have a test group of approximately 600 volunteers. Many of which have been reporting all kinds of positive and dramatic phenomena related to regeneration, healing, well being..... and I do mean dramatic. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;d be happy to provide more information on this and even give anyone samples of these audio frequencies to experiment with if their interested? <br/>
   <br/>
  I could post a link to the group, but not sure of what the protocol for that sort of thing is here as Im still new. Perhaps you could also email me direct if you wish at <br/>
