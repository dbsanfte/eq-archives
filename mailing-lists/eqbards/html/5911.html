<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-356858003">I have the same thing happened to me in Solusek&#39;s Eye.  The only difference <br/>
is I am level 46 so when the goblin ran away, he doesn&#39;t bring back friends. <br/>
:)  It was very annoying though.  The first time it happened, I thought I <br/>
must have forgotten to use chain.  So I thought no problem, I will stop <br/>
autoattack, and when he came back I will chain him and kill him.  Well, <br/>
chain didn&#39;t work, it has the visual effect but no message shown.  So I <br/>
whacked him once or twice, ran away, got healed, came back, I whacked him <br/>
again.. repeat and rinse.  I have to mem DDD at the end to finish him off.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know how warriors and rogues feel like. :) I suggest every bard to bug <br/>
this.  Oh and while you are at it, lets also report those NPC shamen for <br/>
exploiting!  They can SOW indoor! ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;ve confirmed with three other bards over level 30 that there is a problem<br/>
&gt;with Chains not giving any messages when used on creatures that have<br/>
&gt;previous effects cast on them. As was mentioned yesterday, any mob with SOW<br/>
&gt;on it can no longer be chained and will tear off to find help. This nearly<br/>
&gt;killed me last night in Solusek&#39;s Eye. I was healing at the clockworks<br/>
&gt;waiting for my partner when a young goblin strolled through for some reason<br/>
&gt;and attacked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Chains is NOT being resisted but is not giving any success or failure<br/>
&gt;messages at all when used on certain creatures. After I put the beatdown on<br/>
&gt;the young&#39;n he ran off to find help-- way to fast for me to catch him<br/>
&gt;without Selo&#39;s. He brought back a flame gobbo and two cinders. Chain worked<br/>
&gt;just fine on the flame but still would not give any messages when used on<br/>
&gt;the young one (who had been SOW&#39;ed by one of the gobbo shamans on his<br/>
&gt;path).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Luckily my partner got back at that time and evacuated us out, I was about<br/>
&gt;to fear and run for my life when he came in and started casting. This new<br/>
&gt;&quot;bug&quot; or feature will get you killed if you are expecting Chains to hold<br/>
&gt;the mob in front of you. I&#39;ve done a bug report as should everyone else who<br/>
&gt;notices this effect.<br/>
