&gt; Ok, here&#39;s a good story that was relay&#39;d over guildsay from someone<br/>
&gt; who was there:<br/>
&gt; tells the guild, &#39;seems the king room here in Sol-b has 2 groups - one<br/>
&gt; that got pissed about the waiting list or something&#39;<br/>
&gt; tells the guild, &#39;now they are trying to KS from each other&#39;<br/>
&gt; tells the guild, &#39;hehe, they are calling in &#39;big guns&#39; to nuke the<br/>
&gt; doggies. there gotta be 15 ppl here now!&#39;<br/>
&gt; tells the guild, &#39;OMG! the ppl that were on the waiting list are here<br/>
&gt; now and pissed off. they have formed a 3rd group and everyone is <br/>
&gt; fighting for the room!&#39;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So all the people who leveled as fast as they could to &quot;get away&quot; from<br/>
