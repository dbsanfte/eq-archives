&gt;I&#39;ve noticed this too.  Whenever it does, it&#39;s like winning the lottery.  &quot;Get<br/>

&gt;happens with the lull spells of other classes?<br/>

she HAS to because, if it is resisted, she pulls a camp<br/>
instead of the one she was aiming at.<br/>
<br/>
For this, the druid&#39;s harmony is a MUCH better way of pulling.<br/>

Soothe resists way more often to make it something to<br/>
be dependend upon :(<br/>
