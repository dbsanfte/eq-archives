 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a little more subtle than that.  If you&#39;re soloing, the<br/>
comparison is pretty straightforward.  If you&#39;re in a group,<br/>
the extra damage is a small percentage of the damage the group<br/>
does, so it may not exceed the extra damage you receive.  If<br/>
you&#39;re grouped with just a cleric, you definitely want the<br/>
extra weapon.  If you&#39;re grouped with a bunch of tanks the<br/>
difference between using a weapon or shield may be all of 3<br/>
seconds.  If you&#39;re grouped with a bunch of wizards, the<br/>
damage from the weapon may be negligible, and you&#39;ll want to<br/>
use a shield and every taunt song available to keep the mobs<br/>
off your wizards.<br/>
<br/>
What made the decision for me is that my str is not<br/>
spectacular and shields tend to be heavier than weapons.  So I<br/>
just carry two weapons, rather than two weapons and a shield,<br/>
or a weapon and a shield.<br/>
