<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-533213287">I would guess that the system you proposed would make a lot of people happy,<br/>
both those with lots of time to play as well as the casual gamers.  Doubt<br/>
we&#39;ll ever see it implemented though.  Abashi already posted that the people<br/>
who play more should be the ones who get the best items.  What is the cost<br/>
of getting those items though?  I joined a group in the assasin room last<br/>
night.  Three of the group members had been in the assasin room over 10<br/>
hours in hopes of looting a thick banded belt from the supplier for their<br/>
character.  The group leader took vacation from work for the next three days<br/>
so he could camp the supplier until he got a TBB.  He had been in the room<br/>
for over 16 hours straight.  He said the supplier had spawned 15 times since<br/>
he had been there and not once did it drop a TBB.  The idea of having fun<br/>
was even in the equation anymore.  Not that my wife would ever let me play<br/>
that many hours straight, but I can&#39;t see myself ever camping that long for<br/>
an item.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted it in a while.  Basically, it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; way to end camping.  Every named mob is always spawned, but<br/>
&gt; you can only kill/loot it once in your character&#39;s lifetime.  <br/>
&gt; Item rarity is then determined by the frequency of the item<br/>
&gt; appearing on that mob.  As it is now, item rarity is<br/>
&gt; determined by the the number of players willing to camp the<br/>
&gt; mob for umpteen hours to get the item.  That would get the<br/>
&gt; special items more evenly distributed among the playerbase,<br/>
&gt; rather than having them concentrated in the hands of those<br/>
&gt; with prodigious amounts of otherwise fruitless camping time.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;d also stop farming and eBay selling cold.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are some other changes minor needed to make it work<br/>
&gt; properly.<br/>
