&gt; I did another test last night, just to be sure how bad the nerfing of<br/>
&gt; Lullaby really was, and to have a baseline to test against this patch to<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; if anything changes.  I had the following results vs my West Freeport test<br/>
&gt; subject.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;These percentages are very close to what I got.  But:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;You got close to double the number of total resists that I got<br/>
(10/415).<br/>
<br/>
I got 31/563 = 5.5%<br/>
You got 10/415 = 2.5%<br/>
Not sure how you got so few, may be an aberration I was under the impression<br/>
that no song, spell, etc., could ever get below a 5% outright resist rate.<br/>
<br/>
I did a small test with my charisma at 97 to see if that changed things.<br/>
Secondary resists were 38.9% with 200 pulses.  I got bored at that point and<br/>
gave up disgusted.<br/>
