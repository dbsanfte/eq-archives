Guys I&#39;m not the one looking in the code. One of our programmers is on<br/>
vacation and one of the other ones is about to run and hide every time I<br/>
come upstairs.<br/>
Unfortunately it is not as simple as &quot;ok let me search for bard song xxx&quot;<br/>
our code base is huge and complicated. I don&#39;t have access or authority to<br/>
run searches there.<br/>
<br/>
Our programmers have a LOT of stuff on their plate so please be paitent with<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
We are patching on either Wed or Thurs. After everything is finished for<br/>
this patch the programmers will have some more time to look at all the<br/>
things I&#39;ve been asking and asking and asking.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry this is taking a while. No one is intentionally blowing off<br/>
Bards. Bards are the number one fix in the Testing Department, but honestly<br/>
we&#39;re also trying to verify new content. No I&#39;m not hiding anything, I&#39;m not<br/>
trying to let anyone down &#39;easy&#39; but these things don&#39;t happen overnight.<br/>
<br/>
I will make sure that on Friday at the _latest_ the programmer in charge of<br/>
this and I sit down and try to figure out the lulaby resist rates. Thursday<br/>
during the patch if he as time.</div>
