<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471779655">&quot;The Bard&quot; is a common nickname for William Shakespeare.  The line is from<br/>
Hamlet and is uttered by Hamlet&#39;s mother Gertrude.  It is actually &quot;The lady<br/>
doth protest too much, methinks.&quot; with &quot;too much&quot; implying that the<br/>
protester isn&#39;t being truthful.<br/>
<br/>
No, the remark wasn&#39;t a slam to EverQuest bards and was actually used in<br/>
poor context.<br/>
<br/>
In EQ you might use the remark when someone powerloots an item and then<br/>
screams to the zone for thirty minutes that he&#39;s innocent.  &quot;Methinks he<br/>
doth protest too much.&quot;<br/>

&gt; I just read on the EQVault main page Brad&#39;s recent post on the official<br/>
&gt; Gameplay forum.  He talks mainly about the lifespan of EQ.  At<br/>
&gt; the very end<br/>
&gt; of the post is the following comment:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (I didn&#39;t realize that until someone here pointed out to me, that we<br/>
&gt; complain the most about things we care about. Many here have since denied<br/>
&gt; it, but I think &quot;They doth protest too much&quot; to paraphrase &quot;THE BARD&quot;)<br/>
&gt; Agreed.<br/>
&gt; Thanks very much for your comments.<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t had the time to read the Gameplay forum to get the full<br/>
&gt; context of<br/>
&gt; the thread but the way I interpret it someone posted that bards<br/>
&gt; protest too<br/>
&gt; much and that Brad agreed.  Am I misinterpreting this or has our class now<br/>
&gt; gained the reputation at Verant as a whining class?  If the<br/>
&gt; original poster<br/>
&gt; was referring to John Kim&#39;s post concerning lullaby I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; how that can<br/>
&gt; be interpreted as a protest.<br/>
&gt; Of course, the quote &quot;Thou doth protest too much&quot; could be a reference to<br/>
&gt; William Shakespeare, which my Alabama high school education did<br/>
&gt; not give me<br/>
&gt; too much exposure to:-)<br/>
