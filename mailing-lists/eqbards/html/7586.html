&gt; &gt; I really think your connection speed is playing a huge factor<br/>

&gt; You&#39;ve obviously never met Chief Goonda and tried to recover<br/>

first thing I would&#39;ve done since you weren&#39;t successful at<br/>
getting a bind in Highpass, is run to Qeynos and request a<br/>
bind there.  Yam it up with a sob story about being killed by<br/>
Chief Goonda while bound in Freeport.  I&#39;d have to say 3 of<br/>
your Freeport-&gt;Karana runs were self-inflicted.<br/>
