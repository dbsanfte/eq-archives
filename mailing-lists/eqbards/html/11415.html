<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852920017">Beside my bard I play about 2-3 other characters ranging from levels 5 to15<br/>
and I find myself in many groups where I end up playing &quot;backseat bard&quot; to<br/>
the bard already in the group. Usually this starts when the bard in question<br/>
is not twisting anything, or better yet when they are playing Jig in order<br/>
to help out the casters.<br/>
<br/>
Of course not everyone appreciates this at times so I just remain quiet and<br/>
just let the bad karma roll on, thinking to myself, &quot;well next time they<br/>
fire up chords when we get mobbed, the &quot;beat me silly&quot; sign is going to be<br/>
hanging off their back.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>

&gt; &lt;Arkansas Drawl&gt; I Feel your pain &lt;/Arkansas Drawl&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Put that up there with: (at early 20&#39;s)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Play the mana Song&quot;<br/>
&gt; (Then the bard launches into a long explanation that the &quot;Mana Song&quot; comes<br/>
&gt; at 32 and why Jig of Vigor doesn&#39;t really increase mana and why it seems<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; increase mana)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Okay, but play the mana song&quot;....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My advise (probably obvious but worth stating) is to join a guild - where<br/>
&gt; you can explain these things to people who hopefully will be intelligent<br/>
&gt; enough to understand what we&#39;re doing...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back to the Jig topic - it&#39;s amazing how many people still insist that it<br/>
&gt; speeds mana.  I was in a group with a 31 Bard who argued with me - that he<br/>
&gt; tested it.  He tested it by timing how long it took for the casters to get<br/>
&gt; full mana after a battle.  When I asked if the casters always made sure<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; used up their mana - his response &quot;What difference would that make?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another case I was with another bard - and a Druid.  I asked the Bard why<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; was doing Jig?  Because the Druid asked him.  I told the Druid that it<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t (the usual blah-blah-blah).  Her response (I can&#39;t remember exact<br/>
&gt; words - but to the affect) - She had a 41 level Bard character - so she<br/>
&gt; obviously knew more about it than I did (I was level 27 at the time).<br/>
&gt; (Pardon me for having a life!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back to your initial complaint..  You were in a no-win situation - if you<br/>
&gt; tried to point out their flawed thinking - you would have looked like sour<br/>
&gt; grapes.  Those people were especially ignorant - given that since Anthem<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t stack - you couldn&#39;t have been doing what he was if you wanted to!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway - good luck to you - and hopefully you&#39;ll find better groups!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Was in a full group tonight with 2 clerics, shaman, paladin and an<br/>
&gt; &gt; additional bard doing MM yard trash.  Two clerics.  A shaman.  LOH.  How<br/>
&gt; &gt; could I die?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Foolish, yes I know.<br/>
