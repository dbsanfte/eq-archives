&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your concerns really struck a nerve with me and I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to share some of my<br/>
&gt; observations about life as a bard.  As mentioned in <br/>
&gt; previous reply, we<br/>
&gt; bards are actually very good soloists.  When things<br/>
&gt; get hairy, we have the<br/>
&gt; accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In<br/>
&gt; the situation you<br/>
&gt; described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d hit accellerando at<br/>
&gt; about 3 bars of health.  This is because you slow<br/>
&gt; down below 2 bars and you<br/>
&gt; may need that extra bar to get some distance between<br/>
&gt; you and the orcs.<br/>
&gt; Always have accellerando hot-keyed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Second, lament is a great spell but it can, as you<br/>
&gt; have learned, fail.<br/>
&gt; However, the lower the level of creature is compared<br/>
&gt; to you, the more likely<br/>
&gt; it is to succeed.  Never use it on a white or higher<br/>
&gt; con.  It will fail way<br/>
&gt; too often.  But, if they all con green or a low<br/>
&gt; blue, you could solo a camp<br/>
&gt; and clean it out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Third, our greatest power is in grouping, but<br/>
&gt; grouping is risky.  It is a<br/>
&gt; high-trust situation.  Be very careful who you group<br/>
&gt; with and guage how well<br/>
&gt; you can trust them.  I might group with a group like<br/>
&gt; you had described, but<br/>
&gt; I would not trust them to save my butt if I got in<br/>
&gt; trouble and at the first<br/>
&gt; sign of trouble, I&#39;d run.  Only when they have shown<br/>
&gt; that they can be<br/>
&gt; counted on to keep me alive when the going got rough<br/>
&gt; would I let myself get<br/>
&gt; low in health.  I die more frequently in a group<br/>
&gt; then solo because I am<br/>
&gt; still too trusting and eager to jump into danger to<br/>
&gt; save someone whose<br/>
&gt; stupidity got them into trouble... usually failing<br/>
&gt; and dieing along side of<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be up front with them about this though.  Make sure<br/>
&gt; they understand that<br/>
&gt; since you don&#39;t know them well, and your life is<br/>
&gt; dear to you, you will do<br/>
&gt; what you have to to protect it until some trust and<br/>
&gt; teamwork has developed.<br/>
