wood elf and can figure out a way to get it without falling<br/>
victim to or paying off the kill stealers.<br/>

By the way, the slow switch from bronze to steel plate plus a<br/>
couple miscellaneous items is definitely helping.  With a<br/>
near-fully bronze ensemble, I was at 69/77 carrying zero loot.<br/>
Switching to a steel breastplate and arms, a thick leather<br/>
apron, one silver plated bracer, and elf-hide gloves, I&#39;ve<br/>
managed to knock that down to 61/77, which is a doubling of my<br/>
weight capacity. I suspect that&#39;ll drop to 59/77 when I get a<br/>
second bracer (three paladins in my guild want ghoulbane, and<br/>
the bracer is the common drop, same AC, 1.0 lbs vs 3.8 for<br/>
bronze).  I&#39;ve saved up enough for the steel greaves as well,<br/>
just need to hop over to Faydwer to buy them.  They have the<br/>
worst AC/weight ratio, but I need them for the complete silver<br/>
look.  :-)<br/>
