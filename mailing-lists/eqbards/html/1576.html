<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110206419">The way I think is this. You need a certain faction level to get a ring<br/>
from the Sherrif. Getting one drops your faction so you can&#39;t just stand<br/>
there handing them out and asking the sherrif for a new one.<br/>
<br/>
	I heard a rumor that back in Beta you had to turn the ring into the cleric<br/>
and go back to the sherrif to ask for another ring. Thus when you turned the<br/>
ring in, your faction had to be raised enough for the sherrif to give you a<br/>
new one. If you were to lose the ring, sell it, or turn it in to the wrong<br/>
person, you had to prove your worthiness again by taking out a few more<br/>
goblins/orcs.<br/>
<br/>
	Now that the cleric recharges it and hands it back to you, I don&#39;t know<br/>
what the faction adjustment would be for.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)I&#39;ll add that you *gain* faction for recharging the ring.<br/>
