<div id="ygrps-yiv-138302235"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ll take your word for it.  My friend who has a 35th monk on Sol Ro is<br/>
&gt; always complaining the warrior with the executioner axe is outdamaging him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  hehe.  That brings up another question, can a group of L35s get an<br/>
  ex axe, or is having an exe axe at L35 just a perk of an advanced<br/>
  server.  I&#39;d lean toward no, unless said group was really good or<br/>
  really lucky.  It&#39;s just the bad thing about monks, their fists<br/>
  are the best thing they have and they progress without the ability<br/>
  to twink with anything better.  A level 15 warrior with an exe axe<br/>
  and dual/double (relatively low) would cream a monk no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Still neither of those weapons is appreciably better than the dirk <br/>
&gt; if at all. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The dirk is such an all level, all purpose weapon. hehe.  I mean<br/>
  6/23 with stat bonuses aint that bad.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; acquire any of the comparable 1HS weapons in the game.  The gap is indeed<br/>
&gt; enormous and could easily be filled if Verant had any desire to do so.<br/>
&gt; Obviously someone out there is writing quests as new ones pop up all the<br/>
&gt; time.  Paladins get a new holy weapon quest, we get another fed ex<br/>
&gt; messenger.  That&#39;s balance for you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  For just starting out, we do get the shaft.  Lot&#39;s of 2hb and 1hb<br/>
  mini quests that produce decent low-mid level weapons.  And hell,<br/>
  I watched a level 20 warrior solo Paglan (L23-25?)... he got lucky,<br/>
  almost died but the dice were in his favor.  That big guy got LotW,<br/>
  which is what 19/44???  cripes.  A level 20 dude walking around <br/>
  with a pretty beefy 2hs weapon.  Not to mention the regular Langseax.<br/>
  <br/>
  With my bard knowledge now, I would have been a much more successful<br/>
  bard early on for sure.  I would have started to Selos/Chords wisps<br/>
  at level 6 or 7, hehehe.  God I wish I had tactics back then.  I <br/>
  think bards and weapons are a little overrated, since I rely on <br/>
  them very little.  I just get other monsters to fight for me, ;)<br/>
