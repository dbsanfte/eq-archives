<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-891417776">Well, on a whim I started a Wood Elf bard on a server where I know no one<br/>
and have no other characters. The idea was to see how I could do on wits<br/>
alone (no twinking, no help by friends). What a blast. here is my report, it<br/>
might have some good info for brand new bards:<br/>
<br/>
I fixed a few issues with Tszaaz&#39;s stats, I put a bit more into str. I think<br/>
85, and life is easier, 80 was just too low.<br/>
<br/>
I started out running mail and whacking bats, people were offering 2-3pp for<br/>
batwings so I got a bit of money. Bone chips went to 5pp but I found it hard<br/>
in GFay to get enough. The HUGE difference for me was that I wasn&#39;t afraid<br/>
to use Chords of Dissonance. Yes, I got crosswise (read: Dead) with a Fairy<br/>
Noble once...one Guard Related incident did occur (I would have gotten away<br/>
with it too if Felwithe Guards didn&#39;t share hate lists with Kelethin<br/>
guards), but on the whole it made a HUGE difference.<br/>
<br/>
Next, I lucked out and found someone who wanted to work on their tailoring.<br/>
I brought them ruined wolf pelts and they made me a fair amount of patchwork<br/>
armour. <br/>
<br/>
I had chosen Agnostic this time around instead of Quellios (I remain a<br/>
Quellist in my heart, but I am keeping it under wraps publicly :o) and<br/>
possibly do to this I couldn&#39;t get the pixie dust or Orc hatchet quests till<br/>
I  had whacked a fair number of orcs (or it was hitting level 5, don&#39;t know<br/>
which). <br/>
<br/>
Around level two I had 3pp and started pestering the auction channel for an<br/>
FS dagger. Well, in the first of several miracles a truly wonderful Dwarven<br/>
Lass summoned me and presented me with a Pugius. Woof, what a difference.<br/>
After having played Tszaaz to 35 I really think that focusing on dagger<br/>
rather than 1HSlash makes the most sense. Before the Pugius my plan was FS<br/>
Steel until I could afford a Dragoon Dirk. Upgrades from there would be<br/>
obsidian shard and Blade of Fiery Lamentations (what Tszaaz Dual Wields).<br/>
Knowing no one and having no plans for joining a guild I figure waki/yakis<br/>
are too far away to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
The next miracle was: &quot;The first newbie to poke me at the newbie lift gets a<br/>
surprise&quot;. I expected the worst (heh) but after the first newbie to get<br/>
there already HAD one, I was next in line for...A Dwarven Ringmail Shirt.<br/>
WOOOO!<br/>
<br/>
This miracle was slightly eclipsed by (you won&#39;t believe this) finding the<br/>
following littering the top of the newbie Lift:<br/>
<br/>
Large Broze BP<br/>
Medium Bronze P<br/>
Medium Bronze boots<br/>
FS Hammer, greatstaff and scim<br/>
<br/>
It was like 5am (woke up early and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep) so no one was<br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
After selling the FS weapons I had enough to buy my songs, I plan to sell<br/>
the Large BP on Anitonica and hope to trade my medium for small.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Level 3-4 were standard stuff, level 5 however was spent in LFay hunting<br/>
pixies. Great money, great exp...and when I rule the world every tree in<br/>
LFay shall have a Brownie Outcast nailed to it.<br/>
<br/>
So, what next?<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I hit 6 it is off to Anitonica. I was planning to stop off at the<br/>
Sisters isle and hope to buy a Purity Belt but someone sold me one for 4pp<br/>
in GFay so that errand is taken care of. I now have the following goals:<br/>
<br/>
1) Shin gauntlets/grieves in LGuk. It will be fun to be there as a level 6<br/>
newbie, who knows, maybe I will make a dash for a mask :o) both shin pieces<br/>
are No Drop and near the zone, people will often be happy for you to loot<br/>
them...I will be bringing NagaThin Brand Muffins N&#39; Milk, so that may help a<br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
2) Carnal pauldrons from SolB. Also No Drop, near the priest room. I have<br/>
never tried for these before, but if I can pull it off, well, it will be<br/>
quite the coup. Defiantly a weekend night thing :o)<br/>
<br/>
3) Off to Blackburrow to raise enough money to play banker in Cazic Thule.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is being a total hoot to have to apply every trick I know to make it in<br/>
this new strange world. Yes, I have lucked out by getting some great gifts,<br/>
but on the whole it has been fun and exciting playing a young bard *well*. I<br/>
know how to set my hotkeys, I know when and how to run, it&#39;s a dream<br/>
compared to starting Tszaaz. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there is a report from the front. back to work.<br/>
<br/>
Tszaaz...<br/>
