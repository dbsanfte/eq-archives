As I have just started using the CoD/DDD/Hymn Instrument Switching Medley<br/>
(thanks to reading about how to do it here), and I find it depends on what<br/>
you are fighting and/or who you are grouping with (or not). It worked very<br/>
well, even though I don&#39;t have my brass skill maxed quite yet... a few<br/>
missed notes, but I just kept on going (my brass is getting there - it&#39;s in<br/>
the 70s now, whereas on Sunday it was only in the 40s or so). Anyway, in<br/>
groups or solo, I find that this Medley works very well, as long as you pull<br/>
things to someplace semi-secluded. I switch to the bellow when anything<br/>
starts to run, as its an easy way to finish it off. Sometimes, when grouped,<br/>
I have found that the group is so good that I don&#39;t need to use the Heal<br/>
until after we&#39;re done fighting, unless we ended up pulling more than we<br/>
wanted... say two red&#39;s or more. In the case where we don&#39;t need heal, I use<br/>
one of the strength songs (like Anthem), or I even the L20 song (Largo&#39;s<br/>
Mel. Binding).<br/>
<br/>
I must tell you guys that last Sunday nite I got L20 (finally), and, just to<br/>
see if I could do it, I decided to go solo some things with the Medley<br/>
(Cod/DDD/Hymn) and, to my delight and surprise, I got 21 by Friday nite<br/>
almost the entire level by myself!!!! (this is exciting as it took me a<br/>
month to go from L19 to 20 partly due to real life interferance, and also<br/>
due to the fact that there is a big difference between just finding a group<br/>
and finding a GOOD group.... AND when I tried to solo before, I could find<br/>
nothing experience giving that wouldn&#39;t kill me - even if it was blue).<br/>
Anyway, it is really a powerful song combo, and the first two can be<br/>
successfully weaved with Hymn or other songs to help your group or your solo<br/>
career immensely!! (my husband can attest to how excited I was at being able<br/>
to solo things with the combo, too - I kept raving while playing how easy it<br/>
was, once I learned how to do it).<br/>
