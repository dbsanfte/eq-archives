the Assassin room.  Almost every frog you&#39;ll see will be undead.  <br/>
It&#39;s not tough to get to the Assassin room, but you will need invis <br/>
to undead.  Unless, of course, lguk is super camped.  On my server, <br/>
PreKunark you could walk anywhere you wanted on dead side lguk, <br/>
without fear of getting attacked - population averaged 90 - 100 most <br/>
nights.  Now it&#39;s more like 65 - 75 and the frog&#39;s life expectancies <br/>
have climbed. :)</div>
