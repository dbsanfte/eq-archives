<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386674896">Don&#39;t feel badly - I have months in on my bard on Veeshan - and only ever<br/>
got her up to lvl 23 - course - I never really tried to level her up much<br/>
past that.  Currently - my mage on my current server is lvl 31 - in just a<br/>
few short weeks.<br/>
<br/>
With my bard - I was a craftsman first and foremost. 99% of my time was<br/>
spent crafting - talking to people, helping newbies, etc. With my mage - I<br/>
have higher goals I need to reach to be the &#39;taxi&#39; she was originally<br/>
created to be - therefore - leveling was a bit higher priority. With my<br/>
bard - her only leveling goals was to be able to wander the zones she<br/>
frequented most - without getting jumped by every trash mob she ran across.<br/>
<br/>
I too wonder about folks that break their neck to hit 50. It&#39;s pretty<br/>
predictible once you hit 50 in this world you are &#39;done&#39; - why are folks so<br/>
very determined to &#39;finish&#39; then get upset there is nothin new?<br/>
<br/>
Course - if I ever hit 50 - I&#39;ll probably just revert back to my playstyle<br/>
on Veeshan - that&#39;s what I like to do best anyway. <br/>

&gt;Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>
&gt;since about three weeks after release.  It simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>
&gt;could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>
&gt;characters, each on a different server:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my first character ever)<br/>
&gt;Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>
&gt;Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>
&gt;I just have to know what the play time is on a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>
&gt;characters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>
&gt;than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?  I&#39;m not trolling...just bloody<br/>
&gt;well amazed and curious (and obviously jealous). </span></blockquote></div>
