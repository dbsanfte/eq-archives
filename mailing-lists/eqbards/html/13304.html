<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306393296">Umm Shada... you need to take advice from me for once.<br/>
=)<br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T STAND STILL=)<br/>
<br/>
Move around, run around behind them, slow them down with chains, Blast them<br/>
with an AE damage song, run around some more. Don&#39;t ever stand still and let<br/>
them hit you. always keep moving, never stop. do not try and out fight a<br/>
tank. use your damage songs and keep moving=)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then when they are at 200 or so HP, DIRGE them=)<br/>

i dueled a level 50 paladin twice, and got my ass handed to me both times.<br/>
<br/>
once i went songs/lute only (with which i got a level 50 ranger to 20hp),<br/>
<br/>
once songs/weps.  both times i was annihilated.  i think our only forte in<br/>
<br/>
dueling is against casters, which we have much more resources against, and<br/>
<br/>
which i have a much much better record (still a big doughnut against melee,<br/>
<br/>
i think well over 80% victories against casters).  this paladin did have a<br/>
<br/>
sprinkler and RBB off vox, along with dragonscale bp and some assorted<br/>
<br/>
valorium.  he is even tougher now with full valorium and the shield off<br/>
<br/>
inno.  i&#39;m not going to try again =)  as far as knowledgable, i don&#39;t know<br/>
<br/>
if the paladin you fought was, cause my friend bashed the hell out of me<br/>
<br/>
with his shield and stopped my song almost everytime.  yes we do resist all<br/>
<br/>
their crappy spells, but they still output a lot of damage.  i was looking<br/>
<br/>
forward to getting him low and dirging him before he LH, but never got the<br/>
<br/>
chance.  equipment makes all the difference on melee classes, and his is top<br/>
<br/>
notch.<br/>

&gt;   I had the chance to duel a Paladin the other night in Hate.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
&gt;   At first, I just wanted him to kill me, so we could begin insertion.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   It was taking forever it seemed.  He got me down 2 bubbles, and I<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   decided to lay into him.  Two yks versus his soulfire.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Someone here said I&#39;d get my ass stomped by a Paladin/SK.<br/>
