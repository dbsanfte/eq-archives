<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think 51 was really that bad.  It probably just <br/>
&gt; seemed worse because<br/>
&gt; we&#39;d never experienced such hellish levels before.  54 is <br/>
&gt; definately brutal<br/>
&gt; though.  I think I&#39;m going on 3 weeks at 54 now :)<br/>
