<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616489606">My main points were not about &quot;who&quot; posted the stuff - but more what was<br/>
posted:<br/>
<br/>
1) Worried that bards will be LFG because of being &quot;weak&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
* This I think happened and was just recently addressed in ways to help<br/>
bards solo and get groups assuming they can realistically mez 2 or 3 mobs<br/>
long enough for their group to kill the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
2) VI seems to have the right intentions (ie wants bards to be wanted in<br/>
groups) but does not have the practical experience on how to make this<br/>
happen in the game - at least not until players spend a lot of time telling<br/>
them that stuff is wrong.  <br/>
