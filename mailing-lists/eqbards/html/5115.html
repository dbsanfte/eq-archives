&gt;By non-combat he is talking SUPPORT roles, not trade skills.  I can do much<br/>
&gt;more damage buffing/healing/debuffing then I can with a couple of puny<br/>
&gt;blades.  Every since I demolished a lvl 26th Paladin at 22nd lvl, using no<br/>
&gt;weapons BTW, I have been a firm believer in the power of the Bard&#39;s song.<br/>
&gt;If you are limiting yourself to only being on the front line swinging your<br/>
&gt;sword at the creatures face, you are limiting yourself and not helping the<br/>
&gt;party to your full abilities.  It also takes a lot more bravely to face<br/>

remember.  Been so busy I haven&#39;t even been able to play EQ lately.  If you<br/>
think all I ever do is stand there swinging my swords, (Actually dagger and<br/>
sword) that isn&#39;t true.  But, at least I am able to, and I am sure better at<br/>
tanking then a rogue.  :)  Heck, I like the bard because I have so many<br/>
options in combat.  It is rare that I am ever in a group with more then<br/>
three people.  I can&#39;t even remember that last good group I was in with more<br/>
then 4 people.  No comunication and a complete lack of trust really does<br/>
suck.<br/>
