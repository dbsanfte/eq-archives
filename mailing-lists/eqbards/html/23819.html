<b>Subject:</b> Broken Minotaur Lord&#39;s Horn <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-175275597">I was helping a friend take down the Mino Hero earlier today, and he dropped <br/>
a Broken Minotaur Lord&#39;s Horn. At the time, I was on as my higher level <br/>
druid, and I let a young bard loot it instead. I did some research <br/>
afterwards and found that it&#39;s used in a shadowknight quest for Darkforge <br/>
armor, but I was wondering if it actually has any effects when used as an <br/>
instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Having never seen one of these before, I did a bit of research and found <br/>
that it adds +10 to poison resists, but no word if it actually affects wind <br/>
songs by any significant increase. Anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. :)<br/>
