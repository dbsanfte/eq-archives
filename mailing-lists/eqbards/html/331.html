<b>Subject:</b> Bellow&#39;s intended effect (speculative) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327761746"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.      Bellow first came out doing 35 or so points a shout, 50&#39;s at level 20.<br/>
&gt; You can almost drop a red creature without having to even run from it. It<br/>
&gt; was an exploit because the song was too powerful. I hear some, however,<br/>
&gt; thought it perfectly natural... They soon toned it down to where it<br/>
&gt; currently is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An interesting tidbit.<br/>

Apparently the way Bellow was supposed to work was that it was to do the huge amount<br/>
of damage that it originally did (something like four times what it does now), but<br/>
singing it was supposed to render you unable to sing any other song for the entire<br/>
delay time of the Bellow (to see how long this is, bellow at something once and see<br/>
how long it takes for the button to enable itself again without you clicking on it).<br/>
<br/>
I guess the idea was that the song was bad for your voice.  :)<br/>
<br/>
If Bellow actually worked this way, would it be an improvement?  Would people prefer<br/>
that it worked this way?<br/>
