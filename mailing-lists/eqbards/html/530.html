<b>Subject:</b> Spare skill points <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-609789502">Having just reached the 12th circle (and loving Bellow), I was<br/>
wondering what people do with all their skill points.  I have<br/>
9 available at the moment, I think, and I have trained at least a<br/>
point in everything I can use at my level, including a couple of<br/>
languages, baking and tailoring.<br/>
<br/>
So, what do I do with the other skill points?  Is there some high<br/>
level skill that I should start saving for now?<br/>
