<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000710386">Well, in the case of invis, can&#39;t sing and be invis, and they are nice<br/>
enough to put that text in red so you notice it. But for enduring breath,<br/>
there is no warning short of a gurgling noise you make as you try to extract<br/>
oxygen from water. You&#39;re right about the others though, I do know when<br/>
invis and illusions are about to drop 90% of the time. (although a little<br/>
additional input that every other class gets wouldn&#39;t hurt)<br/>

I don&#39;t even really notice this because 90% of the time, I am looking <br/>
at my messages scrolling by.  This helps me to twist songs (along w/ <br/>
counting beats in my head) and so I will always see the messages that <br/>
say when your spells are going to wear off.  I know that Invis(undead <br/>
and regular), Illusions, Endure Breath, Levitate, etc. all give you a <br/>
couple of *warning* messages.  i.e.  &quot;You feel you are about to look <br/>
like yourself.&quot;<br/>
