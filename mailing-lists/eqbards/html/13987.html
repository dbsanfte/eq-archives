<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-722727740">I actually like this one... one problem though.  It takes all those level<br/>
50&#39;s who would be camping the EXG for a charred guardian shield and moves<br/>
them into Lower Guk or Sol B and has them camping YK&#39;s, Mithril 2-handers<br/>
and such.  We already know that a lot of the reason those level 50s are<br/>
farming the level 20&#39;s dungeons is because they are bored and there is no<br/>
room for them in the higher level dungeons.  So you may help with the lower<br/>
level crowding a tad until all those 50&#39;s with absolutely nothing to do<br/>
create new characters and then they take them into the level 20 dungeons.<br/>
God knows it won&#39;t take a level 50 long to get a level 25+ up and running...<br/>
they had enough time to get a level 50 already for gods sake :P.  So in the<br/>
end, you end up making the higher level dungeons more crowded and the lower<br/>
level dungeons more crowded...  Of course, if this is combined with some<br/>
other solutions to eliminate camping and over crowding we may have a plan.<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t see any way to fix a darn thing though without tripling<br/>
the size of the world (including adding a lot of new or duplicated dungeons)<br/>
or tripling the number of servers, neither of which I think has a shot of<br/>
happening.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; As several people have noted, one cause of overcrowding is a higher level<br/>
&gt; character soloing in a spot designed for a group of lower level<br/>
characters.<br/>
&gt; One level 50 camping Item X takes a potential spawn area from a group of<br/>
&gt; level 20&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Potential solution:  Magical items don&#39;t drop if the character doesn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; any experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; + reduces farming<br/>
&gt; + reduces twinking<br/>
&gt; + frees up spawns for appropriate level groups<br/>
&gt; - forces you to get an item before you gain a certain level<br/>
&gt; - forces you to trade for an item you can&#39;t get yourself<br/>
