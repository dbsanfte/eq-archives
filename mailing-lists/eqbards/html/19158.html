<div id="ygrps-yiv-322928808">Beatdrop is my first character.  I was in such a hurry to get in the <br/>
game and join my friends, I forgot about bonus points all together!  <br/>
43 Levels and never noticed a difference.  Still singing strong.  I <br/>
can definately tell you, bonus points mean squat! Ok, so maybe you <br/>
can carry more with a little extra str, big deal :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Uhh actually depending on race putting points in strength is a <br/>
valid<br/>
&gt; &gt; character creation strategy for a necro.  Some necro races <br/>
&gt; &gt; are pathetically<br/>
&gt; &gt; weak and need to be boosted (depending on play style).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ALSO:  Not everyone is about min/maxing their characters for <br/>
&quot;optimal<br/>
&gt; &gt; performance&quot;.  Some of us are roleplayers who like to build a <br/>
&gt; &gt; story around a<br/>
&gt; &gt; strangely strong, weak, stupid, clumsy character.  I created <br/>
&gt; &gt; a rogue with<br/>
&gt; &gt; intentionally low dexterity just to have something to build a <br/>
&gt; &gt; story line on.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And, I would submit, putting stats into strength can never be <br/>
&gt; &gt; considered<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Bad&quot;.  It gives you more carrying capacity and the extra ATK <br/>
&gt; &gt; you get from<br/>
&gt; &gt; it isn&#39;t bad either, everyone melees at lower levels, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; some folks like to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get in and mix it up a little always, especially when soloing... <br/>
which<br/>
&gt; &gt; necro&#39;s tend to do alot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just because someone&#39;s style differs from yours doesn&#39;t make <br/>
&gt; &gt; them &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lyrnia<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now you&#39;re just getting silly.  As Rokken said, there are <br/>
&gt; &gt; some BARDS out<br/>
&gt; &gt; there that don&#39;t know that you can&#39;t twist invis with another <br/>
&gt; &gt; song.  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t like what Gordon has to say sometimes, and on occasion <br/>
&gt; &gt; he does stick<br/>
&gt; &gt; his foot in his mouth.  But that doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; &gt; how to play<br/>
&gt; &gt; EQ.  He&#39;s been playing it a hell of a lot longer than you <br/>
&gt; &gt; have, that I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a fact :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;FYI:  I&#39;ve known him, in game, since Beta 2.  He&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nice guy, fun to hunt with and very knowledgeable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about his OWN class.  Just like we are.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;blame him for not knowing bards.  He&#39;s a mouthpiece,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nothing more.  He had an idea, offered it up and was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wrong and admitted it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I mostly lurk here but I really feel that I do have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; comment here.  Remember Gordon is the guy who felt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that putting points into strength for his necro was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; valid character creation strategy...that IMO proves<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; his lack of understanding of how EQ works awfully<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; well.  My Bard is at a whopping level 8 yet because I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have 3 characters over level 30 I was able to see that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; twisting invis wouldn&#39;t work.  I don&#39;t blame him for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not knowing Bards...I blame him for not knowing EQ as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a whole.<br/>
