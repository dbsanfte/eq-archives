&gt;Speaking of which, does anyone know what mobs are linked with griffennes?  <br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like nothing<br/>
&gt;better than to speed up their spawn rates by clearing some trash but don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;know exactly who or<br/>
&gt;what to kill.  Beetles?  Griffawns?  Griffennes are annoyingly rare in such <br/>
&gt;a large zone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well last night myself, another 35th lvl bard(Ziann), Mysten (35th lvl <br/>
cleric), and a friendly 50th lvl shamen(Sharden) were killing everything in <br/>
sight in North Karana.  It seemed that clearing the Griffawns did help the <br/>
poping of Griffennes and Griffons.  It is amazing what 2 35th lvl bards with <br/>
tracking can do in a wide open zone.  Ziann had the biggest train of the <br/>
night (5 griffawns), but I found the most Hill Giants (5).  We netted 2 <br/>
lambent stones, 3 Griffenne charms, and a Downey Feather for the Sharden. It <br/>
was a blast.  Going to get arms and a bracers (is Genni is around) tonight <br/>
Woo hoo!<br/>
