<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171455789">Actually most of the people i group with since i got the lvl 44 song all<br/>
have 2000 mana which seems to be the upper limit, more int or wis doesnt<br/>
seem to help. Our necromancer keeps getting more and more int, but she is<br/>
still stuck with only (hehe, only) 2000 mana (after much testing). So i<br/>
could play the song but it wouldnt help her total mana... so to me the song<br/>
is completly useless. This is all feedback from the casters, i cant<br/>
actually determine this myself obviously. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;People have this mistaken assumption that more mana = more<br/>
&gt;spells.  That is not the case.  The amount of mana a caster<br/>
&gt;has determines the number of spells he can cast without<br/>
&gt;resting/meditating.  The mana regeneration rate determines how<br/>
&gt;many spells he can cast over a given period of time.  You can<br/>
&gt;have 100 mana or 1000 mana, if your mana regeneration rate is<br/>
&gt;unchanged you will still cast the same number of spells/hour. <br/>
&gt;Thus, more mana is advantageous in a single fight; it is not<br/>
&gt;advantageous over the long term (if you use that advantage in <br/>
&gt;a single fight, you pay for it with longer downtime).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;e.g.  Your party tries to take and hold a room.  The cleric<br/>
&gt;has 500 mana.  You attack and are only able to clear the first<br/>
&gt;half of the room before the cleric is out of mana and must<br/>
&gt;meditate.  The cleric meditates.  By the time he is at full<br/>
&gt;mana, the portion of the room you&#39;ve cleared has respawned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The typical reaction to this type of scenario is &quot;damn, we<br/>
&gt;could&#39;ve done it if we&#39;d only had more mana.&quot;  This is not so.<br/>
&gt;Say the cleric had 1000 mana.  You attack and are able to<br/>
&gt;clear the entire room, with the cleric finishing OOM.  The<br/>
&gt;cleric meditates.  By the time he is at 500 mana, the entire<br/>
&gt;room has respawned, and now the scenario is identical to the<br/>
&gt;previous.  More mana lets you take the room once where you<br/>
&gt;could not before (single fight), but it does not enable you to<br/>
&gt;hold the room (long term).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I would say the use for the song is if you can forsee a<br/>
&gt;situation where you need additional mana for a single fight.<br/>
&gt;Start singing it before, let the casters top off, then start<br/>
&gt;the fight.  That should let them get one or two extra spells<br/>
&gt;in for just this one fight (after they&#39;ve cast the first few<br/>
&gt;spells, you don&#39;t need to keep the int/wis boost up).  Having<br/>
&gt;the effect last longer would be more convenient, but not<br/>
&gt;advantageous.<br/>
