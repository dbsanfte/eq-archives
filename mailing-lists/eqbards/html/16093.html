&gt;   those songs will be vague and poorly tested.  That comment is based on<br/>
&gt;   my 1.5 years of experience with Brad&#39;s team.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my expectation too. In case people don&#39;t know, through all of<br/>
beta, right up to the last week of P4, there were only 20 bard songs in<br/>
the game. Then, just before they booted us all off to go final, most of<br/>
the current 20-50 songs went in (with huge gaps in the 40&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
Just how much testing and balancing do you think got done on them before<br/>
they got in (and no they weren&#39;t on the test server either)<br/>

Heh, I remember that. I also remember on the last day of P4 they put in<br/>
wildly broken quests that would give items worth 60 to 100 plat when sold to<br/>
merchants :)  I managed to get my bard outfitted in full chainmail in an<br/>
hour or two, haha.  I should have gone for plate, but I was getting lots of<br/>
ohhh and ahhh zooming around in full chain the last day.<br/>
