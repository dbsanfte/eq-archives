<div id="ygrps-yiv-247180137">It is worth a white dragon scale, or SS BP, as it is most likely the 3rd<br/>
best rogue weapon in the game behind Mrylokar&#39;s Dagger and a Primal<br/>
Spear.  You should get a lute of the howler and a selo&#39;s drum imo, and<br/>
you would still be getting ripped off.  a lute of the howler sold for<br/>
14k last night on mith marr, and selo&#39;s drums are about the same.  and<br/>
its the only one i have ever seen sold.  too bad i have no bard lol.<br/>
that horn you have is worth at least 75k.<br/>
<br/>
oh and btw, it was a loot table screw-up again by verant.  16/22 wu&#39;s<br/>
fists of mastery were dropping in lesser fay, cobalt BPs were dropping<br/>
in sol a.<br/>

Well, I spoke with my contact in the guild last night, and he seemed <br/>
amenable to the trade, however, he had no idea what the Lute was or<br/>
where <br/>
it dropped.  Judging by the rarity, I think it&#39;s safe to assume they<br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
have one in the bank, so it may be some time...<br/>
  This guy&#39;s a personal friend, so I know he&#39;ll do what&#39;s best for me<br/>
and <br/>
the Guild at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep you updated!<br/>
