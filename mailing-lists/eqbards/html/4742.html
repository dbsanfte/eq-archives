<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648809848"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Lullaby is nowhere near as good as it was in beta.<br/>
&gt; Of course an enchanter is THE way to go for crowd<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been playing around with this song.. It&#39;s much better with an<br/>
instrument (obviously), and after bumping up a level it&#39;s even ok sometimes<br/>
with just singing it. My favorite thing to do is to go to the orc camps or<br/>
the derv camps (which are all green or blue to me now mostly) and see a few<br/>
lower level players wanting to fight but seeing too many dervs or orcs<br/>
there.. I&#39;ll run in, and play the Lullaby and then the other people and<br/>
their group come in and whack em&#39; down one by one. They love me for it. I<br/>
usually only do it once so as to not give them a continuous unfair<br/>
advantage, but it&#39;s still a nice way to make easy friends while ridding the<br/>
world of some orcs and dervs. It also makes a nice screen shot to see a bard<br/>
playing a lute in the middle of dead npc bodies everywhere..</div>
