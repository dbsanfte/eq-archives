<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996399121">At 29th level, I have all the rhythm based songs as well as the Psalm of<br/>
Warmth and Vitality.  Up until this point, when I want to buff resist rates<br/>
because my group is fighting a caster, I have always chosen to sing a Rhythm<br/>
based song with drums instead of the Psalms.  From my experience, caster<br/>
mobs seem to have a restricted spell book, casting no more than 3 or 4<br/>
different spells in any combat.  Of the 3-4 spells they will cast, it seems<br/>
that only two different spell realms will be used, i.e. either magic based<br/>
or one of the other areas (i.e. fire/cold/disease/poison).  IMO, it seems<br/>
safer to hedge your bets and boost resist rates in three realms with the<br/>
rhythm series versus only one with the Psalm series.  Will that 6 point<br/>
difference (Psalm @ 51- Rhythm w/drum @ 45) really make that much of a<br/>
difference?  It would if the mob only casted spells from one realm but how<br/>
often does that happen?  This scenario assumes you don&#39;t have to tank the<br/>
mobs and can equip a drum.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a tank by default and have to equip your weapons, IMO you still<br/>
come out better singing a rhythm song instead of a Psalm.  You will increase<br/>
resist rates by a total of 75 (25 in each realm).  Since mob casters tend to<br/>
only use two realms of magic, you only get to use 50 of the extra resist<br/>
points but that is still on par with what the Psalm will give you (51).<br/>
<br/>
The only time I use a Psalm is to get the damage shield when we are fighting<br/>
a melee mob. <br/>
<br/>
Is my rationale on song selection on track or am I missing out on something?<br/>
<br/>
