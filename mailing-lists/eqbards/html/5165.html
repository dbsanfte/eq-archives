got a lot of heat for saying a couple weeks ago - that playing<br/>
the game for the sake of items and experience (e.g. twinking,<br/>
power leveling) will lead to boredom?  :-)<br/>

People think it&#39;s the items and abilities that make the game<br/>
fun, when for most people it is not.  It&#39;s the anticipation,<br/>
discovery, and the interaction you have with others in getting<br/>
there.  Telling others (bragging if you like) that and how you<br/>
got an item or level is as much or more fun than actually<br/>
getting it.  (And for many of us, it is equally fun to see<br/>
someone&#39;s reaction when you turn right around and give that<br/>
item to them for simply being a friend or nice person.)<br/>
