<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415650187">You know, the cause is sooooo obvious, how could nobody have seen it yet?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s because all us bards are always running around, banging on drums,<br/>
blowing horns, flutes, and strumming lutes, and lord knows what else all the<br/>
dang time.<br/>
<br/>
All that racket...<br/>
<br/>
Was probably quiet for a long time, until we came along.  I have yet to see<br/>
any Iksar or Dorf bards in Kunark or Velious...so it was quiet until we came<br/>
long! <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re simply too dang loud!<br/>

Atonal  :)<br/>

I got creamed in Burning Woods in the mid 40&#39;s by Bees due to this - they<br/>
would just keep coming and coming.  Aggro problem never seemed to affect my<br/>
non-bard guildmates<br/>

Hehe one time I was pulling in DL and got hammered by this bug.  I had been<br/>
pulling non-stop for about an hour or so.  About midway through, I started<br/>
to get the &quot;ghost&quot; Mayong faction messages whenever another group killed a<br/>
spider.  So one time I go out and pull a single spider.  There were no other<br/>
