the know&quot; on our list, and he has indeed confirmed the presence of<br/>
&quot;Twisting&quot; (a term he hates).  He said that the game was balanced with this<br/>
ability in mind, and as several higher-level bards have pointed out - &quot;He<br/>
who does not stack/weave/twist/mix/riff or medley is lost&quot; ;)<br/>
