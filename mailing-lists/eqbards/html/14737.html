&gt; they are the other classes&#39; specialties, b) our songs affect an entire <br/>
&gt; group, and hence our songs are &quot;more powerful&quot; than individual spells, <br/>
&gt; and c) our songs do not require mana and hence can be cast indefinitely.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I think (c) is where Verant really screwed up.  Yes our<br/>
songs don&#39;t require mana.  No that doesn&#39;t make them<br/>
infinitely powerful.  You can do a straight no-mana to mana<br/>
comparison pretty easily.  We can keep up 3 songs best<br/>
practical case.  Grouped with 6 party memebers, that&#39;s 18<br/>
buffs full time.  After the early levels, pretty much any<br/>
caster&#39;s mana regeneration rate is high enough that they can<br/>
easily keep up 18 buffs.  When I ground out the numbers in a<br/>
reply to Abashi, a L40ish shaman could easily keep up better<br/>
buffs than we could using only half his mana regen.  Toss in a<br/>
clarity or two and casters are vastly more powerful than any<br/>
bard.<br/>
<br/>
As a counter to this power, we get dual wield.  Great.  Yes we<br/>
can switch &quot;buffs&quot; on a dime, but doing so means depriving the<br/>
group of the other &quot;buffs&quot; we were giving them - no mixing and<br/>
matching to the class for us.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, Verant sees this no-mana &quot;advantage&quot; we have and sets<br/>
our song effects to where they&#39;re vastly inferior to<br/>
equivalent level spells (with two exceptions).  Net result is<br/>
a class who can&#39;t buff as much, whose buffs are much weaker,<br/>
and whose roughly 40% extra melee damage compared to a shaman<br/>
is supposed to make up for it.  It&#39;s flawed reasoning,<br/>
precipitated I think by the lack of anyone at Verant who<br/>
really advocates the bard class.<br/>
<br/>
The only advantage I see bards having is that we have a<br/>
certain combination of songs that no other class has.  Speed,<br/>
healing, charm, fear, mes, attack speedups, target debuffs.  <br/>
No other class has that combo, and it to a certain extent<br/>
justifies us being weaker at buffing or fighting.  But that&#39;s<br/>
why it *really* worries me to see charm become useless, mes<br/>
(Lullaby, Pixie) bugged, and our speedups and debuffs capped<br/>
low at the higher levels.  If you look at what&#39;s left over,<br/>
it&#39;s pretty obvious most other classes offer much more to a<br/>
group than we do.  Our only saving grace is (as most people<br/>
have figured out) Clarity.<br/>

&gt; constrained because many of our best songs are incompatable with spells <br/>
&gt; that other classes are casting.  And their&#39;s are better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The problem I see is not that our songs are necessarily<br/>
incompatible, but that our songs are multi-effect and if just<br/>
one element is incompatible, we can&#39;t use it.  If a ranger is<br/>
snaring, I&#39;d like to Chain for the speed debuff but I can&#39;t.  <br/>
If the shaman is casting Torgors, I&#39;d like to Chain to stop<br/>
runners but I can&#39;t.  I don&#39;t think the spell system was<br/>
designed very well.  Rather than a spell just not taking hold,<br/>
the most powerful effect component should override all the<br/>
time.<br/>
