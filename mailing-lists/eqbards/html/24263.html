 </span></blockquote>Well I thought about it.  At best that 30 seconds will not gain you 400+<br/>
damage.  If you were using your chants during that 30 seconds, and counting<br/>
the best scenario where you lose 2 pulses of Frost, 3 pulses of Flame, and 4<br/>
pulses of Fulfill&#39;s you lose 350 damage from chants to gain 400 pts from<br/>
DDD.  Since you really lose the full 5 pulses of each Chant, some on the<br/>
back side while you restart them, you actually lose 600+ pts of damage in 30<br/>
seconds.  These numbers are just with a store bought drum.  If you have even<br/>
a Nostrolo&#39;s tambourine you lose even more potential damage.<br/>
<br/>
Taking that into account DDD is worse than useless if you have to mem it<br/>
every time you want to use it.<br/>
