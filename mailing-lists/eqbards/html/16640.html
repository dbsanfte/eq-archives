teriffic.  So I sent the following mail to GZ:<br/>

<br/>
I know you&#39;re busy, so I&#39;ll get to the point.<br/>
<br/>
Song: Pied Piper: Causes a MOB to follow the bard in a<br/>
non-aggressive manner for a short time (or group if<br/>
AE).  Too powerful?  Failure causes aggro on bard, or<br/>
MOB(s) go aggro on bard when song is stopped.<br/>
<br/>
I heard you were looking for bard song expansion<br/>
ideas.  I saw this posted on the bard mailing list; it<br/>
looked fresh and original to me, so I thought I&#39;d make<br/>
sure it got to your attention.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>

Yea - I have all the songs we currently need, but i&#39;d love to swap<br/>
one or 2 out for something that is (a) balanced  (b) unusual  and (c)<br/>
won&#39;t  take much, if any special coding.<br/>
