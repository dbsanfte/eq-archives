<div id="ygrps-yiv-296922392">Hail all,<br/>
<br/>
    Well after a mildly frustrating weekend (revolving boat trip from Freeport, <br/>
(you leave, zone, crash, and re-logon to find yourself arriving back at <br/>
Freeport... repeat), obnoxious campers, and a friend that refuses to go to Paw I<br/>
have a couple of questions, one answer and some observations.<br/>
<br/>
1.  The Bank in High Hold (HH) is down stairs.  Yes it is dangerous down there, <br/>
just don&#39;t open any doors.  The Bank is just around the corner (right?) from the<br/>
bottom of a set of stairs.  I only stayed a short time (too low level) so I <br/>
don&#39;t know if there are more then one set of stairs but if you don&#39;t see it <br/>
right away leave.   I like the way everyone is armed in HH.    The bank teller <br/>
was dual wielding.  Who needs guards.<br/>
<br/>
2.  What&#39;s up with Farie Dragons?  The little guys with butterfly wings.  Are <br/>
they monsters to hunt?  Do they have a bad faction adjustment when killed.  Do <br/>
they have good treasure?  No one seems to be hunting them.  Yes they&#39;re <br/>
beautiful but that doesn&#39;t seem to stop most people.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  Thanks for the info on combine weapons.  I had forgotten they were magical. <br/>
Unfortunately if I had the money to buy one I wouldent need to hunt wisps...  <br/>
sigh.  Just have to take my chances with &#39;chords&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
4.  IMHO  Yes you can stack/juggle songs.  Works great most times.  Key tactic.<br/>
<br/>
5.  I&#39;m puzzled by these complaints about our songs.  If you look at at the <br/>
spell lists for the magic classes most of their higher spells are simply better <br/>
versions of their earlier spells.  Why wouldent we also get better songs as we <br/>
get higher?  Also I use almost all of my songs.  Some more then others of course<br/>
but they all have there uses.  (True I&#39;m only 11th level) I used 9 of the 10 <br/>
available song this weekend! (not counting the broken one) I love the <br/>
flexibility of being a bard.  When in N. Ro I got a constant stream of offers to<br/>
join groups.  I felt bad turning everyone down.  So far being a bard rocks!  I <br/>
just hope it doesn&#39;t turn sour later on.  I don&#39;t really expect it to be a <br/>
problem.  Not even being a power gamer (life, girlfriend, job, friends etc.) by <br/>
the time I reach, gasp, 25th level everyone else will be on their second or <br/>
third life and probably much mellower about things.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Speaking of the group I did join.  It had a Dark elf as a member.  When I <br/>
sang Anthem do Arms his strength fell by 10!  Is this intentional? Do Dark Elves<br/>
hate music?  (grin) Probably a bug but has anyone else noticed this?   Ironic, <br/>
that group, 2 trolls and a dark elf, were extremely fun and fair with other <br/>
groups while the Elves and Clerics I tried to share with in the Faydark were all<br/>
extremely obnoxious.  Go figure. <br/>
