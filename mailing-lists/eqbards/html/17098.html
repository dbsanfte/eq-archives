&gt; Do dragons seem any easier to you guys?  We killed Vox last night with 30ish<br/>

&gt; had no deaths.  Nags was almost as easy.<br/>
&gt; My guild is a great bunch of people, but I have trouble believing we&#39;re that<br/>

&gt; Anyone else have an easier than normal time?  Possible dragon nerf?<br/>

upgraded (as of about 1 week ago).<br/>

There are just so many variables that go into these things,<br/>
and you&#39;ll never see most of them because you have messages<br/>
turned off to cut down on spam, that we&#39;ll probably never know<br/>
for sure.  Maybe something your casters did early on made a<br/>
big difference?  Maybe Vox didn&#39;t use her AE breath attack as<br/>
much?  Maybe she didn&#39;t dispel as much?  There&#39;s just no way<br/>
to know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I only say consensus is that Nagafen was upgraded because<br/>
several guilds who used to be able to kill him on Karana were<br/>
unable to despite multiple attempts, and the two guilds we<br/>
expected would have no problems needed two attempts.<br/>
