&gt;Okay - so this isn&#39;t nearly so good as the Ocean of Tears where the boats<br/>
&gt;can sail west to go east.... but, it&#39;s still pretty funny...<br/>
&gt;On Kunark, there is a large lake (the Lake of Ill Omen).  Rumour has it<br/>
&gt;that this lake is supposed to be salty - and this might even be supported<br/>
&gt;by the river that flows (uphill in some places) from the ocean to the lake<br/>
&gt;- but if that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be - where is all the water<br/>
&gt;going?  And why isn&#39;t this whole zone flooded?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway - it started out as an argument about why the water flowed from the<br/>
&gt;ocean into the lake, instead of backwards - until we remembered that<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s some NPC that says the lake is salty...<br/>
