 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you went in through the 2nd floor.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
tried that route yet, but it winds up in the lobby/grand hall<br/>
so doesn&#39;t really gain you any advantage over going in from<br/>
the front.  The throne room and princess is up there though.  <br/>
Seems like it&#39;d be a safe place to camp as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stuff fairly nicely. 2&#39;s and 3&#39;s mostly.  He cleared stuff and finally was<br/>
&gt; able to pull Mynthi to us.  She stopped just inside the double doors and we<br/>
&gt; rushed her.  We killed her and she forked over some drums (only 2 of the 8<br/>
&gt; had any interest so they randomed and the necro&#39;s bard twink is now very<br/>
&gt; nicely twinked.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Double ack!  Even in pickup groups, most folks allow people to<br/>
lotto for their secondaries only if none of the people there<br/>
can use/want the item.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen Mynthi spawn 7 times over the last week I&#39;ve been<br/>
playing.  She had the drum 6 of those times, so it seems to be<br/>
the common drop.  (My guild got 3 of them. :)  The problem<br/>
with fighting her (and the negotiator) is that if they get off<br/>
some good charms, you can be in trouble quick.  I&#39;ve had<br/>
fights with the negotiator that ended in 3 seconds, and I&#39;ve<br/>
had fights with her where my entire group ended up at half<br/>
health (3 charmed despite having MR over 100).  Bad Sylly for<br/>
not singing a magic resist buff while fighting Mynthi.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, with a L50 pulling, first thing you should&#39;ve done when<br/>
you saw Mynthi on your tracking was to get the L50 to pull<br/>
her, skipping everything in between.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then we got a fairly hard pull. A gypsy musician is in the pull and goes<br/>
&gt; down.  I died in the battle and don&#39;t know if there was a gypsy lute on her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can see it if they have it.  They equip it just like we<br/>
do.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And then the leader says &quot;invis (caster invis not bard invis) up and go thru<br/>
&gt; those doors make a left and into the garden.&quot;  &quot;Ugh - not the garden!!,&quot; I<br/>
&gt; say.  In we go and we get aggro&#39;d in the room before the garden.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Piano room.<br/>
<br/>
If you can set up in a corner of the garden, you should be<br/>
able to get only one crowd of mobs at a time.  Unfortunately,<br/>
like I said, if you end up fighting in the piano room and you<br/>
or a mob makes it near the windows, everything outside will<br/>
aggro on you inside.  We had that happen to us with a group of<br/>
about 10.  The only reason we survived was because we&#39;d almost<br/>
finished clearing the piano room when the garden came in, and<br/>
we had two enchanters.  We still lost 3 people in that fight.<br/>
Btw, that screw-up was due to someone not listening when we<br/>
said attack the same mob, and a runner getting away because it<br/>
hadn&#39;t been snared because the two rangers were fighting the<br/>
same mob everyone else (except one person) was fighting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I get<br/>
&gt; stunned, spun and see what looks like a way out so I run for it.  Then I get<br/>
&gt; stunned again and die again and gnid back to 40. Ugh. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it looks like your group will win the fight but you will<br/>
die, it&#39;s better to just stay in one place and die.  If you<br/>
run, you&#39;ll take some mobs with you.  You&#39;ll aggro stuff as<br/>
you run out, and after you die or zone, the mobs originally on<br/>
you will tell the new stuff about your group, and they&#39;ll all<br/>
go to finish your group off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, that is now my 4th time in MM.  First was a lake group when I was level<br/>
&gt; 19 - really good xp. Second was a trip to the garden at 39. Died that time<br/>
&gt; too. Then last weekend, in the secret room was good and did not die - that<br/>
&gt; made me brave. And finally a tour of part of the interior.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only 4 deaths in Mistmoore?  You&#39;re doing pretty good.  I&#39;ve<br/>
died there like a dozen times, and I only die about once a<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;d like to learn more about MM and think that harmony or lulling areas then<br/>
&gt; fighting for a room is the way to handle it.  Pulling out the front door is<br/>
&gt; not a good tactic.  We learned that the hard way.  Also, enchanter(s) and<br/>
&gt; clerics are required if a group is going to go in.  Ya, ya, we all know that<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, a L40 bard and two like-level tanks can take the<br/>
kitchen, and from there clear out the butler and maid rooms.  <br/>
Gotta be ready for the harm touches from the cooks though.  <br/>
Seems to be about 200-250 points, which can hurt if both<br/>
target the same person.  Just charm one of the 3 kitchen mobs<br/>
into helping the fight, and it&#39;s a 4 on 2 fight.  (And if<br/>
you&#39;re good, you can Pixie Strike the extra mob too while also<br/>
healing your tanks. :)<br/>
