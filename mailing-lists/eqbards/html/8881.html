<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Something very much like this happened to me last night, causing me to<br/>
&gt;lose my level.  I turned in the crafted greaves components and got the<br/>
&gt;greaves and exp, and all the centaurs immediately attacked me.  Guides<br/>
&gt;said too bad, so sad so, I guess it&#39;s back to the birdhouse for me.  I<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t attack (my attack key is f12, so I was nowhere near that) and I<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t accidentally hit any area spells (the hotkey page I was on<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t have any area spells on it).  Plus, they didn&#39;t attack my group<br/>
&gt;partner after I was dead.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to check if they were<br/>
&gt;still KOS to me, since I had my body dragged to the bridge and camped<br/>
&gt;after I got dressed.  I was not terribly happy that the guides<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t res me after such an obvious bug, but with no way to prove<br/>
&gt;it, I guess they really can&#39;t do anything.  Anyone else have this<br/>
&gt;happen on other quests? </span></blockquote></div>
