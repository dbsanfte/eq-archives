<div id="ygrps-yiv-712817850">I noticed this happening a lot too. Especially when you are working with<br/>
ladders like in lower guk. Sometimes they warp once and warp no more,<br/>
sometimes they&#39;ll do that through the entire fight. I have been playing<br/>
around with this and have noticed that successfully pixie striking the mob<br/>
will tend to stop it from warping. I&#39;d guess Lullaby would do the same.<br/>
YMMV.<br/>

  And the warping I&#39;m talking about is:<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic pulls a X mob.<br/>
  X mob has poor pathing.<br/>
  X mob doesn&#39;t follow Harmonic, instead it turns around and get stuck.<br/>
  Harmonic waits.<br/>
  X mob then warps ontop of Harmonic.<br/>
  Harmonic steps off, and fights.<br/>
  X mob warps ontop of Harmonic again.<br/>
<br/>
  This crap has been in the game for months and months.  It was to<br/>
  address those dumb fawks who were standing in safe spots and killing<br/>
  monsters.  Now the mobs warp on you.  (They can hit you, you cannot<br/>
  hit them).  But they don&#39;t do it once, they do it everytime you move.<br/>
  Thus, I lose 50% of my combat rounds trying to skirt around to hit<br/>
  the enemy before it plops down ontop of me.<br/>
<br/>
  And they wonder why players find ways to trick monsters or exploit<br/>
  them.  I feel like the monsters are exploiting me!<br/>
