<div id="ygrps-yiv-222355602">Selo&#39;s grows as you level, a modest boost to speed every couple of levels.<br/>
Level per level, with a drum, you&#39;ll always be a good deal faster than a<br/>
Spirit of Wolf user.  Without a drum, it&#39;s still a bit faster.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit of Wolf grows with the caster as well.  A level 30 druid can run<br/>
faster than a level 9 shaman, for instance.<br/>

&gt;While hunting in West Commonlands, I noticed a L30 druid<br/>
&gt;running with Spirit of the Wolf on, so I tried chasing her to<br/>
&gt;see how SoW and Selo&#39;s Accelerando compare.  My L15 bard was<br/>
&gt;very slowly able to catch up to her.  The closing rate was<br/>
&gt;slow enough that I&#39;m not sure if it was a difference between<br/>
&gt;the spell and song, or if she just had a slower machine than<br/>
&gt;me (I have a friend with a slow machine and in just normal<br/>
&gt;running I can slowly pass him).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I&#39;m pretty sure Selo&#39;s Accelerando gets faster as you<br/>
&gt;gain levels/skills.  There are two trees where I did some<br/>
&gt;impromptu timings when I was L8.  It took about 10.4 seconds<br/>
&gt;for me to run between them with Accelerando and a drum.  I<br/>
&gt;recently missed the boat by 5 seconds (when oh when will they<br/>
&gt;add a second boat between Freeport and Butcherblock) so I went<br/>
&gt;back to this spot to kill some time.  At L15, my bard took 9.7<br/>
&gt;seconds to run between those two trees.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(I suppose it&#39;s possible the druid was encumbered.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know anyone that&#39;s high level and can cast SoW to do a more<br/>
&gt;controlled test.)<br/>
