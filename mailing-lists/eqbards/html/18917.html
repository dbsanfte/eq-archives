<div id="ygrps-yiv-742608350">Yes, it is in the thread.  Copied from the thread:<br/>
--------------------<br/>
* Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (15) - Resist rates so high that song is <br/>
unusable. Level 50 bards get 50% resist rates on level 1 mobs. Resist <br/>
rates for many sub 30 bards well over 80%. Resist rates were more <br/>
reasonable prior to patch that added secondary resist check. Also, <br/>
the song affects pets on pvp servers. Also, the song is considered <br/>
higher than enchanter enthrall spell. Action: Look into resist rates <br/>
on song & adjust.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Haven&#39;t read the thread - but personally - I&#39;m more concerned with <br/>
Lullaby<br/>
&gt; &gt;being looked at than any of the issues posted here...<br/>
