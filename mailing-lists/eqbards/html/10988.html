&gt; &gt;This was reported to the list yesterday mornin - after the patch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Veeshan went down last night - and there happened to be GMs in channel - so<br/>
&gt; &gt;take this for what&#39;s it&#39;s work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: To GM - fippy    Bards levitate seems to only work for 3 tics after a<br/>
&gt; &gt;pulse, does not continue, and you have to land before it can be restarted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Secret Nerf - or unintended bug.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Unintended bug - it&#39;s amazing what can break.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It should have said it&#39;s amazing what can break when you don&#39;t care enough<br/>
&gt; about a class to test changes to it even to the level of &quot;targeting a bat in<br/>
&gt; a newbie zone&quot;<br/>

whoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>
coded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>
it.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>
*every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>
the patch would be rather long in getting out.  That bug will likely<br/>
be fixed in the next patch.<br/>
