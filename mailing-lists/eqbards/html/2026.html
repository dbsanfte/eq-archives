<div id="ygrps-yiv-203996179">yep level 1.  although it does increase its effects as you level, just like<br/>
hymn of restoration heals more hit points per pulse as you level (or your<br/>
skill increases).  of course it is not just the level 1 by itself, its only<br/>
good combined with level 36 celerity.  and the level 42 song is a LOT better<br/>
with a brass instrument, but i hate sitting in the back playing an<br/>
instrument, battle bard that i am.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for doing some research. I have to say that my only feedback<br/>
&gt; is some disappointment. I would have hoped that at your level the<br/>
&gt; berserker song would be so much more incredibly better than any song<br/>
&gt; stacked with our LEVEL ONE (?!?!?!) song. (I did read that right,<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t I?)<br/>

&gt; &gt; well it was just me and a 44th level warrior in solusek&#39;s <br/>
&gt; eye B, taking on<br/>
&gt; &gt; some greater kobolds, and we decided to test which battle <br/>
&gt; songs are most<br/>
&gt; &gt; effective.  the results were:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; once you get to level 36, dump anthem de arms.  we found it <br/>
&gt; to be very<br/>
&gt; &gt; ineffective, not very fast, and just a bit more STR than <br/>
&gt; the other tests.<br/>
&gt; &gt; at level 36, stack Chant of Battle and Verses of Celerity, <br/>
&gt; and give your<br/>
&gt; &gt; group an AC, STR, DEX, and AGI boost, as well as attack speed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; now that we knew anthem sucked at higher levels, the <br/>
&gt; question was at level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 42, to play Berserker Crescendo (which stacks with no other <br/>
&gt; songs) or the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Chant/Celerity combo.<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is still a question, some people prefer one over the <br/>
&gt; other.  what we<br/>
&gt; &gt; could discern was that Berserker made you hit for your max <br/>
&gt; dmg more often,<br/>
&gt; &gt; along with some increase in attack speed.  it worked really <br/>
&gt; well with my<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior&#39;s executioner&#39;s axe, so he could hit for 80+ more <br/>
&gt; often.  but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Chant/Celerity combo gives you a bit of everything, <br/>
&gt; including attack speed<br/>
&gt; &gt; and getting hit less yourself, and we deduced that it would <br/>
&gt; be better for<br/>
&gt; &gt; duel wielding, while Berserker may be more suited for 2h weps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If I was to<br/>
&gt; &gt; equip a brass instrument to double the effects of Berserker, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; may make the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Chant/Celerity combo obsolete, but then i could not get in <br/>
&gt; the fight, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; where&#39;s the fun in that?<br/>
&gt; &gt; i will add one other benefit of berserker is that you are <br/>
&gt; only singing one<br/>
&gt; &gt; battle song instead of stacking two, which gives you the<br/>
&gt; &gt; opportunity to play<br/>
&gt; &gt; a second song more easily.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i would love to hear any comments or further input that anyone has.<br/>
