<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042322758">I try not to use fear as a crowd control mechanism.  That does freak people<br/>
out.  I haven&#39;t had much trouble with charm though.  Every time I do it,<br/>
people go, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s cool.  He does a lot more damage than you do.&quot;  I<br/>
think that&#39;s a compliment?<br/>
<br/>
I used to use Lullaby all the time just the way an enchanter uses AoE mez.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t buff, or heal, or anything else while mezzing, but that was okay.<br/>
The way Lullaby is now though don&#39;t bother it will just get you killed.<br/>
<br/>
Lament is something I need to play with a bit more.  I put it away in SolA<br/>
because the goblins never had it work on them.  I need to try it on some<br/>
Kunark mobs and see if it works on them or is just generally broken like<br/>
Lullaby.<br/>

I&#39;ve got 2 questions about Crowd control and lament pulling. <br/>
<br/>
On crowd control, how do you get a group to let you do it?  Every time<br/>
I try charm, mez or selective fear someone (often more than one) freaks<br/>
out.</div>
