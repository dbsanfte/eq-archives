<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-253055932">LMAO.  You obviously haven&#39;t read the all too numerous accounts of people,<br/>
some of them bards, who have been bound in a safe spot in Grobb only to die<br/>
in Guk and get about 20 LOADING PLEASE WAIT messages before they<br/>
disconnected their PC because someone had accidentally trained a guard to<br/>
their bind point by hitting the brilliant &#39;a&#39; key when trying th say<br/>
&#39;What...&#39; before hitting the &#39;enter&#39; key.<br/>
The last one I know of a 19th level bard lost 2 full levels before he<br/>
disconnected and had to create a mule to move the guard so he could ever<br/>
play again.<br/>
<br/>
	Kitasi the quester<br/>
	Laughs at those who thinks bards can safely bind in evil cities<br/>
	Heck, pretty soon Qeynos and Freeport will both be evil cities to<br/>
me!<br/>
<br/>
PS 	On E&#39;ci, a well established server with dozens of 46+ players, I<br/>
have been the only 	one on the entire continent of Erud at least a dozen<br/>
times in the last month, and 	that was at only 1am EST!<br/>
<br/>
We as bards have a much easier time being bound in evil cities. After we<br/>
die, we can invis past the guards, we can use our sneak ability (rogues have<br/>
it even easier because they can sneak and hide at the same time) or with<br/>
Selo&#39;s we can attempt to even just run right past them to the nearest zone<br/>
(you might get whacked a time or two as you go speeding past though). <br/>
<br/>
I agree with the other comments regarding melee classes not wanting to bind,<br/>
but just being able to be bound outside of city zones. I have no problem<br/>
with this line of thinking. Actually, I think this change would be much more<br/>
likely to happen than to restrict those who already can bind.<br/>

casts bind, and it is Necromancer and Shadowknight only.<br/>
