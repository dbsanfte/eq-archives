<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730746518">the standard is 3 seconds, because that is the time it takes to start a<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
the way pauses work is that you add the pause command FIRST on the line,<br/>
then the casting command separated by a comma.  the pause must be first, but<br/>
it will be executed second.<br/>
<br/>
/pause 30, /cast x<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps.  the only bad things about macros so far is that they can<br/>
not account for missed notes and you can not type while they are running.  i<br/>
have used them, but not as often as i hoped i would when they came out.<br/>

&gt; macro button?<br/>
&gt; And how much of a pause do you need to add?<br/>
