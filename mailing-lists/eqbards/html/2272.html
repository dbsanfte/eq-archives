<div id="ygrps-yiv-367246190">I have to say that one more than a couple of occasions I&#39;ve been told that<br/>
I&#39;m the best bard that they&#39;ve been grouped with.<br/>
<br/>
While it may sound like I&#39;m patting myself on the back - I want to add that<br/>
I feel the major reason I&#39;m as good as player as I am is from reading this<br/>
mailing list...<br/>

&gt; There is a bard I grouped with, around level 17 or so.  She was decked in<br/>
&gt; full bronze, and just bellowed (I have bronze, but only the smaller<br/>
pieces.<br/>
&gt; This is because, of course, I don&#39;t think the pants and chest are worth<br/>
it.)<br/>
&gt; I asked her why she never used Anthem, and she told me &quot;bellow works<br/>
better<br/>
&gt; for me.&quot;  Mmm, ok whatever.  Later, with her guildmates, we had to regroup </span></blockquote></div>
