&gt; We had a ranger pulling and got 3 two times.  While it&#39;s<br/>

&gt; &quot;NEVER&quot; expect more than 2.  (Normally charm is good enough to<br/>
&gt; control a 3-mob pull.  The problem with the DW gobs is that<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re all named &quot;deepwater goblin&quot; but some of them are<br/>
&gt; casters.  If your group is fighting one gob and the two you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; charming turn out to be casters, you&#39;re going to be eating a<br/>
&gt; lot of nukes in between charms.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like I said, *ideally* you want an enchanter, healer, and<br/>
&gt; someone who can cast harmony.  You can do it without the<br/>
&gt; enchanter, but I found the fights to be much much easier (like<br/>
&gt; zoning two times vs. only losing 0-2 bubbles) with an<br/>
&gt; enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
Agreed, but after fighting them for an hour, your puller will know right<br/>
away BEFORE pulling if he/she is pulling a wizard, shaman or warrior DW<br/>
gob... at least my wife could tell us ahead of time with about 95% accuracy.<br/>
If we got two, I always charmed the caster... which always was the last one<br/>
out of the water since it was trying its hardest to nuke her.  We pulled 3 a<br/>
couple of times, but with charm it was never a problem.  So I still say the<br/>
perfect group is a tank, druid and bard for this spawn point :-).  I&#39;d take<br/>
another healer rather then an enchanter in this scenario if given the<br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve learned to time my charm so that I&#39;ve usually got it charmed<br/>
BEFORE it gets its spell off which is nice because I get the &quot;A DW Gob tried<br/>
to cast a spell on you but you were protected&quot; message.  I rarely failed<br/>
sticking charm on the DW&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; &gt; pull from Oasis, you need only to run to the inn.   The caster will come<br/>
up<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pulling to the inn makes it a bit harder to use fear.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, not REALLY to the inn.  Just to the edge of slope in front of the inn.<br/>
if you fight them there, they will tend to run back and forth right on the<br/>
slope rather then running away.  We never really got THAT close to the Inn<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, the area we found they do this in was also<br/>
&gt; close enough to the water for the casters to nuke us while out<br/>
&gt; of sight.  :(  We had enough tankage that I let them beat on<br/>
&gt; us until they were at half health, then I chain-feared them<br/>
&gt; while they stood in place.<br/>
<br/>
The way to handle this is to have your tank run clear past your party to the<br/>
inn.  This pulls them out of the water about to the slope.  Then you, the<br/>
bard, engages, the druid snares, you fear and the tank comes running back to<br/>
get some licks in.<br/>
