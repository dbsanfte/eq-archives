&gt; don&#39;t look<br/>
&gt; at equipment. Shoot, I don&#39;t know whether most of it is &quot;good or bad&quot;<br/>
&gt; even. What I look at is first, personality. SOmeone I can get along<br/>
&gt; with. and second, level range. Can I group with them. Occasionally,<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ll be specifically looking for a tank-type, or a healer-type. Or<br/>
&gt; a Snarer. But that&#39;s about it :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on your interests in the game.  If you&#39;re playing to level, and<br/>
your twinked, then you&#39;re better off to play with other twinks.  Likewise if<br/>
your class can solo yellows and your in a group pulling yellows, then you&#39;d<br/>
be better off to solo (unless your seeing a huge reduction in downtime).   I<br/>
don&#39;t hold it against people who choose to play this way.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I look at level first.  I level extremely slowly, so if I can<br/>
group with someone who&#39;s a lower level than me, there&#39;s a chance that I<br/>
might still be within grouping level range with them the next time we&#39;re<br/>
both on.  Personality matters, but that&#39;s not as quickly apparent.  Class<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter at all.  I like to experiment with different group make ups<br/>
and find ways to make each combo work.   <br/>
