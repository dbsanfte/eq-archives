&gt; Yes, I thought of that too and it is a problem every time they set up a zone<br/>
&gt; for lower levels.  There will be a group of lvl 50&#39;s that will rage thru<br/>
&gt; killing everything just to see what items are dropped even though they<br/>
&gt; probably won&#39;t want any of them.  Just use a little reverse planar logic and<br/>
&gt; code the zone to not allow in players of over X level where X is 12 levels<br/>
&gt; above the mean mob level.  That would let them create a dungeon for level 25<br/>
&gt; mean that would restrict flow of items out due to players of a level that<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t get xp anyhow running in to farm stuff.<br/>

killing too many green mobs in a short period of time made you<br/>
start to *lose* experience (it&#39;s too easy, and you&#39;re letting<br/>
your skills slide).  :)<br/>

Of course, to get this to work, they&#39;d have to balance the<br/>
melee classes so they didn&#39;t die to green mobs...<br/>
