<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614164121">A suggestion but no real explanation unless you let one get away half <br/>
     dead.  This happens in premafrost.  One gob flees and comes back with <br/>
     6 - 15 friends about 20 seconds later.  Very exciting...  I have <br/>
     developed a habit that seems to serve me well.  If convenient, I zone <br/>
     every once and awhile to clear me off any Hate lists I don&#39;t know <br/>
     about.  I especially zone if I have damaged a mob but lost track of <br/>
     it.  This is a pain but has saved me from many deaths.  <br/>

In EK pulling crags a few lions decided to play too. No biggie, just kill&#39;em aft<br/>
er the crag. No sooner than this happens, a few more lions pop over the mountain<br/>
 beelining for our party. WTF is this we say? It&#39;s kinda funny at the time becau<br/>
se we had no clue why all of a sudden we were being attacked by lions. Hmph, aft<br/>
er dispatching the latest group our bard (there were 2 of us) heads out again to<br/>
 find a crag. He calls a train and I am getting ready to derail it with Lullaby <br/>
while he picks up the other songs (Is it me or does lullaby have a LONG pulse? I<br/>
 am scared to drop it to twist) Over the hill he comes with no fewer than 14 lio<br/>
ns on him. Let me tell you, that was not a pretty sight. Regardless of our level<br/>
s, we ALL took some hits.<br/>
     <br/>
This happened in NK with Beetles too. And today again, with every freakin orc in<br/>
 the zone.  Cleric calls 20 mana and I&#39;m peeing all over myself trying to kick i<br/>
n the speed and change instruments. DOH! Luckily I was the only one to drop. Eve<br/>
ryone else made it to S Ro Zone in time. <br/>
     <br/>
Someone clue me in on what this is? <br/>
My theory is that the hate list is being passed along via wandering orcs/lions/b<br/>
eetles I may have gotten a little too close to without them following me(or me o<br/>
utrunning them)<br/>

I think our songs are what triggers the monsters.  For what reason I am <br/>
not sure.  While wandering Befallen I passed a necro acolyte if I remember <br/>
correctly.  Being green to me it did not attack me.  So I camped the room <br/>
where the shadow knight with the second key spawns and proceeded to wait. <br/>
When she spawned I started playing Anthem as I normally do when I solo and <br/>
then I am layered with DOTs and I die a horrible death.  Now I don&#39;t <br/>
understand why everything chose that exact moment to take a run at me, but <br/>
I have noticed this for a long time and have happily enjoyed being sowed <br/>
since it doesn&#39;t cause the same number of problems that a bard&#39;s song <br/>
would.</div>
