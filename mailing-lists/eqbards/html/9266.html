<b>Subject:</b> Laments affect on the rest of the party <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-847803169">I&#39;ve used Lament in numerous occasions when I am the puller.  Never used it<br/>
with my party nearby.  Lets assume your party is trying to move from Point A<br/>
to Point B without getting into any fights.  There are five mobs along the<br/>
path.  As the bard, you are up front and successfully Lament each mob in<br/>
order.  The bard could make it easily.  What happens though when your party<br/>
tries to move past them?  Will the mobs ignore the entire party or will the<br/>
mobs attack them?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m inclined to believe that the Lament effect is centered on the bard and<br/>
that anyone else who gets within the mob&#39;s aggro range will get attacked.<br/>
<br/>
This would be a moot tactic if your party was invisible.  However, against<br/>
mobs that can see thru invis it may be a viable tactic if the Lament stops<br/>
the mob from attacking the rest of the party.<br/>

&gt; &gt; How long does the effect of the Lament last after you sing it to the<br/>
&gt; mobs?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Will I have to do it over again when I take on the next mob?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It lasts several minutes for me.  Others say it only lasts<br/>
&gt; about 10 seconds.  Dunno, maybe charisma has something to do<br/>
&gt; with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used it to break up the king area in Permafrost solo.  The<br/>
&gt; first time I tried it, I&#39;d lamented all the mobs on the floor.  <br/>
&gt; I fought an elite guard down to below half health when a<br/>
&gt; newly-spawned priest above us started healing it.  I charmed<br/>
&gt; the elite and ordered it to attack the priest, only to watch<br/>
&gt; in horror as it decided the shortest route to the priest was<br/>
&gt; through all the floor mobs.  Of the four remaining floor mobs,<br/>
&gt; only the patriarch (who was actually the most recently<br/>
&gt; lamented) was activated by the guard&#39;s passage.  The rest were<br/>
&gt; still lamented.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, the guard, patriarch, and priest were enough to<br/>
&gt; do me in.  :-P<br/>
