Darkforge is indeed the SK quest armor. Generally involves getting decayed<br/>
armor from cazic and some other pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Dark Reaver is SK only, additionally I think it is 2h slash, but I won&#39;t<br/>
swear to that. Dunno about Painbringer. Without knowing what level your Sk<br/>
is I can&#39;t recommend a 1H slash to camp.<br/>

My Musical Friends,<br/>
I&#39;ve seen maybe two pieces of medium bronze EVER. =) Ok, so where does it<br/>
drop? Someone asked me last night, upon telling him i made a SHD, &quot;Let&#39;s go<br/>
hunt in Najena.&quot; Does medium sized bronze drop there off &lt;30 mobs? In<br/>
addition, I&#39;d like to verify that SHD&#39;s do have class specific armor... is<br/>
it the Darkforge? If so, I&#39;ll just look it up on a eqshadowknights page or<br/>
something. No need to go into specifics, seeing this is a bard list.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing... What&#39;s a good slasher i can camp for this poor little guy?<br/>
Dark Reaver is SHD only right? Is Pain Bringer WAR only? It sticks in my<br/>
mind as such... Well ok.. Thank you all in advance for your advice and help.<br/>
Look forward to seeing you on! =)<br/>
