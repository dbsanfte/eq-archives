<div id="ygrps-yiv-832110141">Actually bards got a new song. It&#39;s like 20 hp regen and adds ac. Still<br/>
though bards got a nice round of songs can you think of many that would keep<br/>
balance in?<br/>
<br/>
One thing though that really pissed me of this patch was that my level 50<br/>
dark elf necromancer is kos in Paineel the necro city! Heck you think I<br/>
would at leats be dubious. I got my faction to dubious by killing guards but<br/>
it maxed out there. I seriously hope somebody finds a way to get warmly<br/>
because I want to be able to enter the necro city.<br/>

&gt;I was the bard who spoke up, said my piece after the patch.  Abashi seemed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to be quite pissie in his response, but I can understand that.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I tell ya all this... I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s different people working on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>equipment, and if they got another song in.  We are still missing 3 songs,<br/>
and should not settle.  Why bards are a lower priority than other classes, I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;On the good foot, tried the invis song, and it worked...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tried the area affect songs... Largos almost got me killed in lguk...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pulled 2 outta 3 froggies off a pally & ranger, I am assuming they were<br/>
laying on the taunt button...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;All in all... I think he was saying, if I don&#39;t like it, I can leave.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Something about not being able to satisfy all the people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I dunno... just doesn&#39;t seem right to me<br/>
