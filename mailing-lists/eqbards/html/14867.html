  I either open up a can of whoopass, or I get beat into the ground<br/>
  like a little baby.  Either way, I don&#39;t mind sampling a few ice<br/>
  giants with my swords, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  an ice giant says &#39;Get in mah belly&#39;<br/>
  an ice giant says &#39;I ate a baby!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  well actually, it&#39;s more like:<br/>
<br/>
  an ice giant tries to hit YOU, but YOU dodge.<br/>
  an ice giant tries to hit YOU, but YOU are Harmonic.  (lol)<br/>
  Harmonic slashes an ice giant for 49 damage. (blam)<br/>
  Harmonic slashes an ice giant for 37 damage. (pow)<br/>
  Harmonic slashes an ice giant for 23 damage. (boing)<br/>
  Harmonic slashes an ice giant for 44 damage. (whammo)<br/>
  Harmonic has slain an ice giant!<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic says &#39;Oh a gotta live on here, haa haa haa&#39;<br/>
  Harmonic says &#39;That ice giant got a little hot under the collar&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  Harm.</div>
