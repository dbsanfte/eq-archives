<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070121190">question about the voodoo3 3000.  i have this on my ex-wife&#39;s computer, and<br/>
things in game &quot;seem&quot; ok performance-wise.  but when logging in at the<br/>
server selection screen if there is any type of banner announcement it<br/>
scrolls incredibly slow, and on the character select screen her characters<br/>
spin around extremely slow and very jerky as well.  so this has me wondering<br/>
if in-game performance is also sufferring.  i&#39;m not sure if that is normal,<br/>
or i am just used to my geforce.  she has an abit va6 motherboard (via<br/>
apollo pro 133, not 133a chipset, has agp 2X which i guess i should make<br/>
sure is enabled but i thought so for sure), 3dfx drivers version 1.3.05<br/>
(versions 1.4 and 1.5 lock up the system), p3-533B cpu.  i know on my asus<br/>
p3v4x installing the via agp driver increased performance a lot, but when i<br/>
tried on her system it said it was for agp 4x only.  i may try that again on<br/>
hers, but i installed an older via agp driver on hers once and saw no<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
any ideas are greatly appreciated.<br/>
