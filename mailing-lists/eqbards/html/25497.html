&gt;The fact that you cant minimize cant scare me. You couldent do that with EQ<br/>
&gt;either.. Well you can, but it requires a 3rd party program..<br/>
&gt;Besides when Im playing a game I dont need ot alt tab back and forth to<br/>
&gt;other things. And I do agree with Mythic that disabling alt-tab is an easy<br/>
&gt;and good way to avoid script kiddies hacking the game... EQ limited hacking<br/>
&gt;greatly by what it has done. Just compare it with UO.<br/>

is even less exploitable - but the name of the game is profit, and people <br/>
will find a way to profit, any way that they can - even if it means kicking <br/>
some guy in the nads and stealing his million-dollar baseball.<br/>
<br/>
There is no substitute for human ingenuity, especially when powered by <br/>
jealousy or selfishness.<br/>
