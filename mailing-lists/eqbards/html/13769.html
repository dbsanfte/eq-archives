<div id="ygrps-yiv-215138013">Considering I&#39;ve been this level for a month now and probably won&#39;t reach my<br/>
mid-20&#39;s till expansion at this rate, its still very significant for me.  I<br/>
understand what you say about it not being as bad once I reach those levels,<br/>
but if I can&#39;t reach those levels because I keep dying what difference will<br/>
that make?  I haven&#39;t died in a couple of weeks, but I&#39;ve only gained two<br/>
bubs of xp in the same time as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree that the biggest problem is that the argument that we should be more<br/>
hated because we can buff an entire party at once is bunk.  Every buffing<br/>
class can do that and never hit a hate list once.  I had 5 buffs on me last<br/>
nite from a cleric and 6 more from a shaman and never once did they affect<br/>
the mobs hatred of them.  Most of those buffs lasted 45+ minutes so keeping<br/>
them on all 5 of the party members was a piece of cake.  Abashi&#39;s argument<br/>
is indeed insulting and just proves they have no clue at Verant how the bard<br/>
class really works.<br/>
<br/>
On the hybrid/caster question, our enchanter even went so far as to<br/>
accidentally cast Clarity on me last nite.  He forgot that bards weren&#39;t<br/>
really caster&#39;s and had no mana.  Pretty funny considering he has a 15th<br/>
level bard of his own.<br/>

&gt; Problem is I am one of the main tanks for my group about 50% of the time.<br/>
&gt; Usually there is me and a monk, or me and a shadowknight, or rarely me and<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; ranger.  Also backing off does no good.  Unless the mob is rooted they<br/>
&gt; follow me around like puppies wherever I go.  This makes it more difficult<br/>
&gt; for the other tank to melee the mob effectively.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll repeat:  This problem is pretty bad around your level but<br/>
starts to go away as you approach your mid 20s and 30s.  Last<br/>
night I was hunting hill giants with some friends (the<br/>
straight melee approach).  Occasionally a giant would start to<br/>
beat on me.  If I backed off and shut off my songs, my friends<br/>
could get it off me within one or two rounds.  I could then<br/>
start my songs and attacks and get in maybe 10 rounds of<br/>
attacks before I had to repeat it.<br/>
<br/>
I only contributed to the bard hatred thread because it&#39;s<br/>
still way out of line for the amount of benefit we bring to a<br/>
party, and Abashi&#39;s original comments were either ignorant or<br/>
insulting.<br/>
