&gt; I have had this happen with my screaming mace..i believe it will happen<br/>
&gt; with any weapon that casts a spell effect.. by the way you dont have to<br/>
&gt; zone or log to get it to stop..i find if i repeatedly click on a song<br/>
&gt; rapidly that you will get the message   you havent recovered yet   after<br/>
&gt; this you can sing songs normally....this is an annoying bug that i hope<br/>
&gt; they fix as soon as they have time<br/>

If you&#39;re really desparate, you could probably initiate a duel with a cleric<br/>
and have them cast stun on you or something.  Next time you zoned, of course,<br/>
the whole server would think you&#39;re a cowardly dog.  :)<br/>
