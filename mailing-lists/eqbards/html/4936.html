<b>Subject:</b> Races and experience?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-111415036">I play a human bard because I heard that a non-human race gets more of an<br/>
experience penalty then a human bard (i.e. It would take more experience to<br/>
get a wood-elf bard to level then a human one).  My question is: Is this<br/>
true?  And if so, how much more experience are we talking about?  Is it<br/>
worth the night vision and foraging to play wood-elf bard with the increased<br/>
experience needed to level?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
