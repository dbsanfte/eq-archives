&gt; One thing to keep in mind is grouping vs solo.  It is<br/>
&gt; my belief that verant doesn&#39;t really care about<br/>
&gt; solo&#39;ing and they&#39;re just fine with necros being<br/>
&gt; ridiculously overpowered for solo.  In a group a necro<br/>
&gt; has some very good utility with their recent spell<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One necro is better than a group of 2-3 L50s (maybe more,<br/>
depending on class makeup).  You&#39;d have to be a fool not to<br/>
want one in your group.  Yes their DoTs don&#39;t get to last<br/>
their full duration if you kill stuff quickly, but the DoT(s)<br/>
they do manage to put on do about as much damage as 1-3 tanks.  <br/>
Their pet does about that much too.  I could see passing up<br/>
necros for if someone else (especially a buffer or healer)<br/>
were available, but if there&#39;s an empty slot and a necro comes<br/>
a-looking, they&#39;re in.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the formulas I whipped up for the seven-string<br/>
lute comparison, you&#39;ll see that the two primary factors in a<br/>
fight are damage rate, and survival time (rate of damage<br/>
taken).  Any class who can solo well will have a very good<br/>
ratio of these two.  When you group, you add your damage rate<br/>
to the group&#39;s, while your survival time is usurped by those<br/>
with the best values (tanks, pets).  Neither of these<br/>
dramatically make the necro any weaker in groups.  Their<br/>
primary grouped handicap is that they take a while for their<br/>
damage rate to &quot;ramp up&quot; and the group often ends up killing<br/>
stuff before they hit their max.  Still, it can&#39;t take *that*<br/>
long to ramp up or else they&#39;d need to have a large survival<br/>
time in order to solo, in which case they would be able to<br/>
supplant the role of tank.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, &quot;great solo, poor grouped&quot; is a contradiction.  <br/>
The worst you can get is &quot;great solo, ok grouped.&quot;<br/>
