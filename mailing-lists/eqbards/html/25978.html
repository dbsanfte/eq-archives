<div id="ygrps-yiv-493102508">I&#39;m pretty PO&#39;d.  The new 58-Mez seems to drop on the Boss Mobs in Sssra.<br/>
To me this is a balancing song - and they are putting it on mobs that<br/>
require 30+ High Level people and an Emperor Key - and on Xegony are amongst<br/>
the most heavily contested mobs in the game.<br/>
<br/>
If this is the Non-Ancient Song - I can only imagine how difficult the<br/>
Ancient songs are.<br/>
<br/>
Question - do any other classes have Level 58 Spells that drop on 62 Level<br/>
mobs?<br/>

<br/>
Well,<br/>
looks like we get a couple of new mez songs plus some Ancient Songs.<br/>
I also think we got hosed on the DoT stacking issues.  Figures they<br/>
would not put in any effort to make the damage portion of our songs<br/>
stack w/o having the debuff portion stack.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone had a chance to yet locate the new level 58 song?  The patch<br/>
message makes it look like it will be a quest??<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder off what uber mob the ancient songs will drop.  Lcea<br/>
would be the logical candidate but she doesn&#39;t seem to be difficult<br/>
enough for a mob to drop ancient songs.<br/>
