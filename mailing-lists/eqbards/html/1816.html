<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097894">Does anyone have a screenshot of what a player equipped with the demon claw<br/>
looks like in-game?  I am curious as to what Verant did with the &quot;Freddy<br/>
Kreuger&quot; type weapon, i.e. does it just appear as a dagger, etc?<br/>
<br/>
I gave up a long time ago caring about the fact that my hand drum looks like<br/>
a flute, but I certainly hope that we get some major graphical improvements<br/>
somewhere along the line to correct some of the quirks like these that we<br/>
experience.  <br/>
<br/>
I saw one the other day when I bought some cheapo little throwing daggers<br/>
and equipped them in my range attack slot...I was holding a Shiney Brass<br/>
Shield (PENDING LORE BTW) and a Combine LS and when I put the tiny daggers<br/>
in Range attack my Shield and Sword disappeared from my external camera view<br/>
(F9) and it looked like I was just holding a dagger.<br/>
<br/>
I was grouped with a ranger about a week ago in the Oasis and for some<br/>
reason the graphic for his Banded Coif was not showing up even though it was<br/>
equipped on him - I actually thought that was kind of neat, getting to have<br/>
the armor but not having to see it, especially since I am not all that fond<br/>
of the banded graphical interpretation on Half-Elves like myself.<br/>
