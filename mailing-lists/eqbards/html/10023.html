<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501080645">I&#39;ve waked thru MM Castle while invised without being attacked.  I&#39;ve stood<br/>
by countless trains invis without being attacked.  My favorite is going to<br/>
check out the status of the gy while a major train is returning from the<br/>
zone without being attacked.  (I&#39;m not comfortable standing still :)  Trains<br/>
that include every creature imaginable in MM.  I have yet to find a mob that<br/>
sees thru invis.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; will sappers are in mistmoore castle i believe although this is from<br/>
&gt; &gt; another source that someone told me about.  somebody confirm for<br/>
&gt; &gt; me...they see invis and are quite nasty in general.  They look like<br/>
&gt; &gt; really ugly hunched over women... i don&#39;t know what lvl but at 25 or so<br/>
&gt; &gt; (the last time i saw one) they were deep red to me...shortly after that<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yup.  Castle or tower.  They are undead so see<br/>
&gt; invisible.  They are also spellcasters I believe, and have<br/>
&gt; some spell that will drain all your stamina (first time I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen the tanks shouting for invigors instead of heals).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I quit hunting in Mistmoore...they usually come out with deathly<br/>
&gt; &gt; heralds and ushers and gypsies and are part of REALLY nasty trains hehe<br/>
&gt; &gt;  the kinds that leave the zone littered with (and i do mean littered<br/>
&gt; &gt; with) most of the people that happen to be in mistmoore and get in<br/>
&gt; &gt; their way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You cannot believe how incredibly good it feels when you get<br/>
&gt; to a high enough level and your group derails one of these<br/>
&gt; trains.  Of course then the next train has 20 mobs and kills<br/>
&gt; your entire party.  The more things change... </span></blockquote></div>
