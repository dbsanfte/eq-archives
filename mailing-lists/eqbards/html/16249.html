<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366031445">Here are 2 articles that deal with &quot;online worlds&quot; worth reading (well<br/>
skimming at least - first one is ok, but second one is very long)<br/>
<br/>
Basic premise of game mechanics:<br/>

Jonathan Baron&#39;s article entitled, &quot;Glory and Shame&quot;, which may be found at<br/>

With Verant deciding they want to go &#39;hands-on&quot; with their &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>
policy, these have some merit reading.<br/>
<br/>
Play Nice is doomed to fail.  The number of issues that will come up for<br/>
resolution is so much greater than the resources that Verant has allocated<br/>
to handling them (ie not enough Guides to handle all of the whiners that<br/>
will surface.)  Verant should have stuck to the mechanics of computers that<br/>
gives them power: program code.  If a program lets the user do something,<br/>
some user (or many users) will do that thing. If Verant wanted to stop<br/>
KS&#39;ing, they should have done it in code.  That way they stop each and every<br/>
instance and rules get applied to everyone.<br/>
