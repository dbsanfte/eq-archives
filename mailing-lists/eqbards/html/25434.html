<b>Subject:</b> Natural stats for a 31st level bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-114510775">Hiyas,<br/>
<br/>
My first and still the only character in eq is a bard and because I am a<br/>
casual player I could just advance to the 31st level in some 6 months. We<br/>
founded a guild in Morrell Thule and the guild is faring hell better than me<br/>
in comparison. Still as a newly founded guild we do not have a higher level<br/>
or even a equal level bard, so I do have many questions concerning bards and<br/>
how should a bard played. I like to play a bard and even though I could be<br/>
con&#39;ed as a young bard, I have a good knowledge of the game because some of<br/>
my RL friends got into their 50+ levels in their mean time. Many shoulders<br/>
have been subject to my peering over and I think I could be considered as<br/>
&quot;has done some raids or though campings&quot;. :P<br/>
<br/>
To that extent I still don&#39;t know what I have to compare myself to. For<br/>
instance I do not know to what points I should have raised my charisma in<br/>
this level? Or my other stats of course. I am a capable player though and I<br/>
might be considered as a well faring bard (as far as I can read from faces<br/>
of the customers, that is). What I need here is some guidance, but perhaps<br/>
this is not the place to flood with messages, so I could prefer individual<br/>
mailings, if our moderator does mind multiple messages addressing the same<br/>
issue here. But would be happy if this one turns out to be a thread on his<br/>
own. *grin*<br/>
<br/>
Think that my list of my equips might go into that message too, but frankly,<br/>
I do not have any items of importance for time being. What I do carry are<br/>
the leftovers of fast leveling melee type friends of mine, and some drops<br/>
that I have been able to collect while my huntings with the groups I&#39;ve been<br/>
in. So this means nothing. (For example hand woven leggings which dropped in<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen, bah!)<br/>
<br/>
Just a curious and inexperienced bard speaking here so pls do not hesitate<br/>
to help. :P</div>
