<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430395236">I&#39;d say high 30&#39;s low 40&#39;s *if* you have a good puller or an enchanter. A<br/>
level 50 tagging along would help things because they would be able to do<br/>
single pulls every time.<br/>
<br/>
	Arright, now that I think about it, it&#39;s prolly a whole lot easier to got<br/>
the BBK since us bards can kite the Sand Giant. I just got lucky/bored and<br/>
grouped up with a level 50 one night and we wandered around taking things<br/>
out as we went.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

&gt; 	If you want something akin to the BBK then I have three words for you<br/>
&gt; instead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	Kicsh Der Pavs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	Got one last night and it is a very nice blade. Stats are 10/38 (bit<br/>
&gt; slower<br/>
&gt; than the BBK). Weight is 8.0 (bit lighter than the BBK). Gives you DEX +5.<br/>
&gt; Procs for Strong Poison. 30 DD and 14 per tick (dunno duration). With some<br/>
&gt; help you should be able to go an get it from Paws.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	Good Journey<br/>
