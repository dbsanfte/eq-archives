<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057118817">When I first started doing planes at about your level - I went to PoF at mid<br/>
46 (after they cleared the portal and we could run in without getting<br/>
smooshed).  I played mana song and resist songs (purity and guardians -<br/>
buffs AC too remember and with a good drum it really shows up.)<br/>
<br/>
I found out that my dual Yk&#39;s when they proc&#39;d would get resisted a great<br/>
deal more than I was used to (most mobs were yellow and red) and even though<br/>
it did not damage - it still taunted for 75 dmg.  So, very shortly I<br/>
switched to:<br/>
<br/>
1. Non Procing weapon<br/>
2. Shimmering Orb AC 15 shield<br/>
3. Mana song only if I was in melee combat<br/>
<br/>
In the planes, when you go and the groups are 47-51, you will suffer TPW<br/>
(total party wipe outs.)  Generally, when the leader sees the situation is<br/>
inevitable, he will call for clerics to camp out.  Also feigners should go<br/>
down and bards should camp out as well.  You can make a major contribution<br/>
when they come back and form into res teams: clr clr clr clr bard bard.<br/>
Ressing back 20 or more takes some time and lots and lots of mana.  And this<br/>
is pretty typical of how it goes when you are just learning the planes.<br/>
<br/>
For dragons and gods, I make it my business to keep my cleric alive in the<br/>
best ways I can.  Mainly, staying close so he is in song range and giving<br/>
him resists and mana (and not being another person he has to worry about<br/>
healing).  Also, I monitor his health and call for heals on him if he gets<br/>
low.  Clerics and enchanters are force multiplers.  Melee folks are force<br/>
subtractors.  Both are needed to make a well balanced group but a bards<br/>
contribution to melee is less significant than the contribution he can make<br/>
to keeping the force multipliers alive.  A dead cleric / enchanter usually<br/>
means a dead group sometimes the whole team.<br/>
