 </span></blockquote>OK, maybe it&#39;s me, but isn&#39;t this obvious?!  The old saying goes<br/>
that any item is only worth what two people are paying for it.  If<br/>
some fool is willing to pay 8pp for a Mintaur axe, there is no way that<br/>
I, as the seller, am going to inform him of his error.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who quite frequently astounds me at his stories of<br/>
how much profit he has made from buying low, trading and selling<br/>
high.  Is it his fault that someone is selling a fine steel sword<br/>
for only 10pp, and he can get 20pp for it?  (just an example).<br/>
<br/>
And in another post I read that Verant has officially said that<br/>
jacking up prices is not allowed?!  My God?!  What&#39;s next?!  Killing<br/>
&#39;green&#39; creatures in the newbie area if you are above level 15 is<br/>
illegal?<br/>
Geez, why don&#39;t they introduce a &#39;free economy&#39; option, like the<br/>
PvP option.  If you turn off the free economy, it is impossible for<br/>
you to pay more for an item than an NPC would charge, and you can&#39;t<br/>
sell any item for less than an NPC would pay!<br/>
<br/>
And on this general rant, what is up with the trade skills?  I mean,<br/>
sure, I can sell patchwork armour for 3gp, which represented a <br/>
reasonable return on the time and financial investment.  Although I<br/>
have seen people selling for 2gp lately.<br/>
But studded armour?  No hope selling that at any profit.  Leather<br/>
armour abounds, and is just as good.  Given the cost of making studs<br/>
(I have a friend who is a smith), I don&#39;t think we can break even. <br/>
Reinforced leather?  I do have my doubts, given the ridiculously low<br/>
prices I have seen for banded armour.  I remain hopeful.<br/>
What goes through a smith&#39;s mind when they sell a banded helm for 10pp?<br/>
That is cost, assuming a 30% success rate (which I believe requires<br/>
a skill level requiring an investment of HUNDREDS of platinum).<br/>
Is the entire world of Norrath a charity organisation?<br/>
It is starting to annoy me.  I am seriously considering giving up my<br/>
trade (tailoring), and spending my points on something that will<br/>
actually give me a return.<br/>
<br/>
OK, time for my medicine now.  8)<br/>
