<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186477980">I&#39;m gonna have to go with it being easy, because I now have 5 extra kaesora<br/>
coins.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been going there the last 3 or 4 nights now. We typically start up top,<br/>
drop down, hit the reaver room, crawl to the library, take 2 spawns, then<br/>
crawl to the church and camp there. We&#39;ve seen the raider every single time<br/>
we&#39;ve been there.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, we camped the library for tomes. In one night we saw 3 raiders.<br/>
They seem to be on at least twice the normal spawn for the dungeon. Spawn on<br/>
the dungeon is about 15-20 min. So if you have a raider spawn when you get<br/>
there, expect to wait 30-40 min for the next one. I&#39;m also guessing there<br/>
could be phs so that would mean if you got a ph, it would be 60-80 min in<br/>
between.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, he&#39;s there a lot. If you want the coin, I suggest bringing a group<br/>
and holding the library for 2 hours, I&#39;d virtually guarantee you leave with<br/>
a coin.<br/>
