<div id="ygrps-yiv-511342368">So, the other day in SolB - the usual bat/bug group formed.<br/>
<br/>
  Made 48th as I predicted, but I found that I was controlling<br/>
  the group more so than I have ever before.  And well, some<br/>
  L50 people decided to be &#39;back seat bards&#39; - which I promptly <br/>
  disbanded them.  Had to tell the shamans to stop piercing the<br/>
  bats for 5 and 6 dmg, and sit their pretty arses on the floor<br/>
  to med.  Had to get the cleric on the floor a few times too.<br/>
  Had to plan spell attacks, since the shaman was trying to <br/>
  malaise the bat and poison it, before drowsying it.  Just <br/>
  little things like that tend to make me wonder how these<br/>
  people made L45+.  I mean if you wanted to swing a sword<br/>
  or pierce with a spear, you shoulda decided that 40+ levels<br/>
  ago.  If medding is boring, or you wanna raise your X skill<br/>
  then I politely ask that those people either cease or leave.<br/>
  Sounds strict, but when you have people&#39;s lives in danger,<br/>
  and monsters that can hit in the 100s, I&#39;d like the cleric<br/>
  to be medding for heals rather than bashing something with<br/>
  a hammer and doing &lt; 10 dmg, mostly wiffing.  Then you&#39;ve<br/>
  got these clerics that must nuke no matter what, &lt;rolls eyes&gt;.<br/>
  Wasn&#39;t a good night, like the one before, to say the least.<br/>
 <br/>
  Some idiot wanted me to twist manasong in battle, when we only<br/>
  had one caster and no snarer.  heh.  Chains alone basically is<br/>
  a job in itself on these LDCs and lava beetles.  The same idiot<br/>
  got fussy cause I wasn&#39;t playing the &#39;healsong&#39; for him during<br/>
  multiple mob pulls.  (Without an enchanter, I become a shotgun<br/>
  pixie striker - and that is in fact a full time job)  Making<br/>
  two lava beetles disappear from battle with pixie strike is<br/>
  a huge challenge.  But this dude kept ranting about how I should<br/>
  be healing him at 6 or 7 hp per tick, heh.  So he takes a hit<br/>
  for 102 and I heal back 7 of that - whooptiedoo! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  The next pull, I agree to show him what happens when I just<br/>
  &#39;speed him up and heal him&#39; as he put it.  2 sonic bats, and<br/>
  1 lava beetle show up.  I start berserk, no problems.  They<br/>
  stick on the tanks.  I twist healsong, and instantly I am<br/>
  swarmed...  down two bubbles in less than 3 seconds.  Already<br/>
  proven my point, then begin to attempt to recover this f&#39;up<br/>
  with pixie, the guy is asking where the speed and heal are.<br/>
  After all the things were killed, I located the hotkey bank<br/>
  with my Disband button and clicked it for him.  <br/>
 <br/>
  o Manasong seems to have very low taunt if any at all.<br/>
  o Berserk may or may not get the attention of creatures,<br/>
    it seems to depend on how close I am to the unconfronted<br/>
    mobs.<br/>
  o Hymm is absolute instant aggression.<br/>
  o I would imagine Binding, and other AE songs like Lullaby<br/>
    would create a fair amount of aggression too.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
