<div id="ygrps-yiv-137566471">Hail, fellow tunesmiths!<br/>
<br/>
I had a little free time last night (took a break from all that running <br/>
to-and-fro), and decided to gather some empirical data on my songs and <br/>
disseminate this information to the bardic community.  I´┐¢d love to see <br/>
others doing this, so we can amass a series of data points which will allow <br/>
us to predict what effect a given song will have for a given player.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, enough of the statistical mumbo-jumbo.  Here´┐¢s the data:<br/>
<br/>
Bard, level 17, singing and percussion maxed out at 90<br/>
<br/>
Chant of Battle: +2 AC; +9 STR; +9 DEX sung<br/>
			 +5 AC; +16 STR; +16 DEX with drum<br/>
<br/>
Hymn of Restoration:	heals 4hp per pulse standing; 5hp/pulse sitting when <br/>
sung heals 7hp/pulse standing; 8hp/pulse sitting with lute<br/>
<br/>
Jonthan´┐¢s Whistling Warsong:  +4 AC; +13 STR sung only (I did not test the <br/>
attack speed incease)<br/>
<br/>
Elemental Rhythms: +13 save vs. magic, heat, and cold; +2 AC sung<br/>
			   +23 save vs. magic, heat, and cold; +5 AC with drum<br/>
<br/>
Anthem de Arms:	+13 STR sung only (I did not test the attack speed increase <br/>
here, either)<br/>
<br/>
Brusco´┐¢s Boastful Bellow:	Just included for the sake of completeness, this <br/>
song does at most ((level / 2) +1) damage, so at 17th I do up to 9hp per <br/>
bellow.<br/>
<br/>
Purifying Rhythms:+13 save vs. magic, poison, and disease; +2 AC sung<br/>
			  +23 save vs. magic, poison, and disease; +5 AC with<br/>
                      drum<br/>
<br/>
Guardian Rhythms: +13 save vs. magic; +3 AC sung<br/>
			  +23 save vs. magic; +6 AC with drum<br/>
<br/>
A few notes:<br/>
<br/>
By harmonizing the Rhythms songs, right now I can increase my party&#39;s magic <br/>
resist by 69, their AC by 16, and all the other resists by 23!  Woohoo, this <br/>
is not bad at all...<br/>
<br/>
Jaxan&#39;s Jig O&#39; Vigor: I have taken up memming this song again lately, as <br/>
some long fights will really sap my fatigue.  This little gem is something I <br/>
only use once a fight, but I think it helps a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament and Lucid Lullaby: no hard data to post, but these <br/>
two are very very nice and our best low-level crowd control tools.  Learn <br/>
them, love them, live them.<br/>
<br/>
Cinda´┐¢s Charismatic Carillon and Tarew´┐¢s Aquatic Ayre:  has anyone out there <br/>
noticed any change in these songs when using a wind instrument?  I sure <br/>
haven´┐¢t.  Range seems to be the same, and with both songs it appears to be <br/>
all-or-nothing ´┐¢ either the song works completely or it doesn´┐¢t.  Cinda´┐¢s <br/>
usually raises faction one or two steps, but I have seen a change from <br/>
&quot;glowers dubiously&quot; to &quot;amiable&quot;.  Strangely, the level of the NPC does not <br/>
seem to affect the success of this song.<br/>
<br/>
Chords of Dissonance:  Can anyone who has some hard data on this song please <br/>
post it?  i.e. what level you are, what your string and singing skills are, <br/>
what damage you do sung vs. played´┐¢<br/>
<br/>
May your feet ever be fleet,<br/>
And your voices ever be sweet,<br/>
<br/>
