<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088741565">From what I have read, it has been confirmed that the new 34 song does not<br/>
stack with Hymn.  There have been conflicting reports on the Concert Hall if<br/>
it stacks with Clarity or not.  You get message that both songs went into<br/>
effect, but some folks have stated they didn&#39;t see any noticeable difference<br/>
in mana regen.  Anyone know for certain if Soothing and Clarity will stack?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also what happens when you have two bards in the group?  If both bards sing<br/>
the 34 song, will you get double the effect?  I gotta feeling that it will<br/>
work like Hymn and not stack if both bards are singing it.  Whats gonna suck<br/>
is if it 1) won&#39;t stack with another bard singing the 34 song AND 2) doesn&#39;t<br/>
stack with Clarity.  If this is the case, then the two bards would have to<br/>
go back to both singing Clarity.  <br/>
