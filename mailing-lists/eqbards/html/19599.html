<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975422180">Probably very little.  Certainly less than whatever a Lambent stone sells<br/>
for.  They are useless to anyone except bards and I dont think th emerchants<br/>
will pay very much if anything for them.  You just have to find folks who<br/>
have the coins - or go kill the mobs yourself.<br/>
<br/>
To complete the quest, you do need to give a Star of Odus to the banker guy.<br/>
It sells for about 150pp in Erudin.  he gives you the no drop container that<br/>
you combine the coins in and return to him for the Nostrolo tambourine.  I<br/>
only need to get the Royal Crown coin from Dalnirs.<br/>
<br/>
Been to Kaesora 2 times - got that coin both times.  The failed raider<br/>
should show up with 2 hours pretty easily.  We got some other trinkets<br/>
clearing our way into & around the library: war/pal/shd 2hs, rogue dagger,<br/>
truesilver helm & bracer, int+ mask - good stuff for the level of the<br/>
dungeon.  We were all too old for it (except our 40 clr who saw only a<br/>
couple greens.) Even so, you need to be careful as you can get a swarm of<br/>
greenies with a bad pull or accidental agro.  We had a evac person both<br/>
times and had to do in combat evac once.<br/>

&gt; Speaking of these coins, if you had to buy them, how much would you expect<br/>
&gt; to pay for them?<br/>
