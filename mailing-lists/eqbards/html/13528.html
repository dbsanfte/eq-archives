&gt;i asked someone who tested the zone before going to the live servers.  he<br/>
&gt;said the belt, as awesome as it is, is a quest component as are all drops on<br/>
&gt;PoS.  wow.  also said a lot of stuff won&#39;t be able to be accessible<br/>
&gt;pre-expansion, but some is now obviously.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there are lots of usuable items for classes that are dropped in sky... but<br/>
i dont think the haste sashes, treant tears, etc are. I have documented all<br/>
the quests at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jrh.net/skyquests.html,">http://www.jrh.net/skyquests.html,</a> and none of them show the<br/>
haste belts as quest components. If they ARE quest components, which i<br/>
doubt, then they are not part of the sunset home djinn quests. I think.<br/>
problem is all the quests are riddled with errors, we tried doing one<br/>
cleric quest and got nothing back.  I have a ton of examples of problems,<br/>
but one that is close to home is the songbird mask shows it needs a light<br/>
woolen cloak for a mask... hrmm... well guess what, i got a light woolen<br/>
MASK just now that is not used in any quests. Im guessing the cloak is a<br/>
typo that =&#39;s the mask. I would say well over half the quests have these<br/>
kind of problems =(</div>
