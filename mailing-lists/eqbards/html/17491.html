&gt;herself without any burning immediate goals.  What excitement waits<br/>

 </span></blockquote>my favorite time at 12 was spent on a group of islands in the Ocean of<br/>
Tears. It is a bit more complicated now with two boats, but doable just the<br/>
same. This is really exciting solo hunting that is an adventure all around.<br/>
<br/>
When you first zone in to the Ocean of Tears from Butcherblock , if you are<br/>
on the right boat :o) you will soon pass an island with Aqua goblins and<br/>
Alluring Mermaids. Jump off *grin* and find some dry land out of view of the<br/>
goblins. Also, do a /who on the zone and then another after the boat leaves.<br/>
You now have some idea of the number of players in the zone with and without<br/>
the boat, which will be important for later<br/>
You will find between lulling and careful fight picking you will do very<br/>
very well against the Aqua goblins. Bring lots of backpacks because they<br/>
each drop a bow worth 2+ gold which you can sell back in Butcherblock once<br/>
you catch the boat....*waits for obvious question to arise*<br/>

*Boat Jumping Spoiler*<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When it is time to go sell do a /who on the zone and see if the boat is<br/>
in-zone, you can just shout, but people get tired of this and you get a lot<br/>
of &quot;in the water&quot; so I save it for when I am really uncertain. Stand on the<br/>
rock with the two mermaids and when you first see the boat coming jump in<br/>
and SWIM FOR IT! You need to position yourself directly in front of the<br/>
boat, swimming forward, pointing up at about a 35-45 degree angle. The boat<br/>
will run over you and then you will *pop* up over the bar and be safe and<br/>
dry.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to practice this in Freeport first, me I just went on faith and<br/>
when the time came to leave it *just* worked. It is scary every time though<br/>
because if you miss it then it is another 20 minute wait unless you want to<br/>
go all the way back to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Other classes can hunt there way before 12, but a bard needs Bellow to get<br/>
the goblin runners as they swim away. Yes, you will bee spending LOTS of<br/>
time in the water *grin* It is really a lot of fun, good exp and money, and<br/>
one of the best &quot;adventures&quot; I have had in Norrath.<br/>
