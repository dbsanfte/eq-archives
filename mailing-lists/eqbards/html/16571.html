<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155735539"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Name:     Song of Solidarity<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The name needs to change &lt;g&gt;  We already have that &#39;bind-sight&#39;<br/>
  song that&#39;s called Solidarity.  But that&#39;s trivial ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Function: Whenever a member of the party takes damage, that damage it<br/>
&gt; distributed among the party members.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Hell, I pay them to make their game flexible and the best it can<br/>
  be.  You all do too.  I wouldn&#39;t rule out ideas based on whether<br/>
  or not it can be done.  Because if we did that, we&#39;d have no songs<br/>
  at all... hahaha... errr, that was bad... anyway.  I like your<br/>
  idea, needs to be fleshed out more, maybe tweaked, but it&#39;s most<br/>
  definitely original.  That song coupled with Group Healing would<br/>
  be really nice.  And like I said before, if we present a decent<br/>
  list of possibilities to them they may come up with something<br/>
  similiar.<br/>
<br/>
  Nice idea!<br/>
