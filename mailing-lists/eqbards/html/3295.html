<div id="ygrps-yiv-779080552">I&#39;d have to agree with Dan, I spent several days in Kithicor, met Kithicor,<br/>
he says nothing, met Ged Twigborn he talks about the gloves, met some Shadow<br/>
something or other briefly before he pierced me for 152 points when a wolf<br/>
bit me while memorizing a spell.  Gotta love that, sit down to mem a spell,<br/>
green wolf comes up and bites you, then ranger comes roaring out of the<br/>
house before you can even stand and slays you in 15 seconds.  This guy is in<br/>
the locked house where the guard is outside.  Other than that and a few<br/>
undead and a couple of orcs I could find nothing in this zone.  I wandered<br/>
about for about 2 hrs seeing nothing before I sat down to mem and was<br/>
promptly slain.  Has anyone else found anything useful in this zone?  Other<br/>
than the trees that don&#39;t touch the ground that is.<br/>

Ok, I&#39;m going to have to ask for even more spoiler. :)  I&#39;ve been to<br/>
Kithicor a couple of times, and besides some ruins (stonehenge kind) having<br/>
some rather easy (for a lvl 14 druid, and lvl 14 cleric) mummies and green<br/>
skels, and occasional green skels that pop up around the lake, we haven&#39;t<br/>
been able to find any more critters worth beating up on.  A few blue spiders<br/>
or snakes (can&#39;t remember exactly), few & far between.<br/>
<br/>
So what good IS Kithicor?  I&#39;m not being a smartass or sarcastic, I&#39;d really<br/>
like to know.  Please give me some ideas WHERE is good in there.<br/>

&gt; &gt;everything Kithicor (ALWAYS a good bet for mysterious adventure, there is<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bizarre hidden<br/>
&gt; &gt;story in that woods, over on Crossroads of Norath/Discussions we have a<br/>
&gt; little Kithicor fan club....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally someone else notices...I get sick of those messages that say<br/>
&gt; something like, &quot;We need to get rid of useless zones....like Kithicor&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I adventured there for more than a few levels, and I still get a kick out<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; that dark place...Have you ever met Kithicor himself?  I saw him once by<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; cabin with the grizzley bears and the flag.  He didn&#39;t say much...<br/>
