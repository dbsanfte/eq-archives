<div id="ygrps-yiv-659193799"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As for new graphics for armor, I doubt they&#39;ll provide different looking<br/>
&gt; armor types except in the expansion. Verant&#39;s put in a lot of effort to<br/>
&gt; minimize the different &quot;looks&quot; of armor out there and basically take the<br/>
&gt; armor that is already in the game, and &quot;colorize&quot; it to represent different<br/>
&gt; types. The banded armor for Half Elf is also used for &quot;blackened&quot; armor. The<br/>
&gt; &quot;bronze&quot; armor is used for Mithril/Lambent/Plate (probably barnacle) and I<br/>
&gt; believe Imbrued.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  On this issue, I understand the technical reason why they made so<br/>
  few textured armor looks.  It all boils down to leather/chain/plate<br/>
  with colorization across all races.<br/>
<br/>
  My gripe is that once you reach higher levels you should stand out<br/>
  with the best armor / weapons in the game.  Right now I look like<br/>
  a L20 bard, but instead of bronze (orange) plate I have inbrued <br/>
  (pee yellow) plate.  People say, nice Yk and Fine Steel Morning <br/>
  Star?  Why do you wield that?  Can I buy yer Yk, pls...  And I&#39;m<br/>
  like dude, get lost, heh... it&#39;s not a friggin Ykesha, and this<br/>
  &#39;fine steel ms&#39; would clobber you.  hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant did a poor job of holding people&#39;s interest in the creative<br/>
  department.  They just continue to reuse the same graphics over and<br/>
  over.  I mean the Plane of Sky... how embarrassing.  They took faerie<br/>
  graphics and imp graphics (god I&#39;m tired of imps) and just scaled them,<br/>
  gave them 5k more hp, allow them to hit for 195+ and viola, a new area.<br/>
  Gimme a break.  I&#39;m reluctant to pay 230p to get in and 700p to buy keys<br/>
  to cross what appears to be the desert of Ro in the air, just to meet<br/>
  up with some f&#39;ing imp who can kill me by triple attacking in the 190s<br/>
  in less than 2 seconds.  No thanks. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  Plane of Sky is a flop.  They are going too far with this monkey sink<br/>
  bs.  Time to go beat up some ice giants now for the cash to hit the<br/>
  plane so I can die to find out what goodies are up there, if any.<br/>
