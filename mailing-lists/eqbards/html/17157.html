<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021867285">That&#39;s great!  Congrats on getting the BP so quick!  I&#39;ve spent countless<br/>
hours at the AOF and I &quot;might&quot; have seen one. :)<br/>
<br/>
One other thing I forgot to mention, which you discovered (sorry for it<br/>
being late to help you : /)... The sewers are somewhat tough to pull from<br/>
when unbroken.  There are typically 2 lizards in each room and several<br/>
gators in the water.  The gators kind of blend in with the water making it<br/>
difficult to know how many you&#39;re pulling.  You can also miss gators and go<br/>
to the next room and of course they will jump on the train on the way back.<br/>
Basically, overpulls from the sewers are a fact of life.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe whoever heads there next can make use of this extra stuff. :)<br/>

&gt; Last night our group went to cazic to get the RS BP for our rogue. We<br/>
