&gt; I was just curious... What is the average cost for a barbed leather whip?  I<br/>
&gt; hear they are quite good weapons and I am interested in acquiring one.  I am<br/>
&gt; currently up to 42 plat.  I had the goal of saving for a combine rapier... any<br/>
&gt; suggestings?<br/>

items.  People who are high enough level to obtain them generally have enough<br/>
platinum that they don&#39;t need any more, and so look instead for items to trade.<br/>
This ends up being a big problem for lower level players, who really only have<br/>
plat to offer.  I suggest that if you want one of these before you are able to<br/>
kill Bonecracker yourself, buy one at whatever price you see.<br/>
<br/>
They are, btw, excellent weapons for a bard, as they are very efficient and do not<br/>
have any annoying &quot;lockup&quot; abilities.<br/>
