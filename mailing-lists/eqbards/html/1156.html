<div id="ygrps-yiv-771888017">So, has anyone tried out any of the new songs and figured out what they do <br/>
yet?<br/>
<br/>
I purchased the level 30 song, but haven&#39;t had the chance to investigate <br/>
yet.  The icon is a red-background Disenchant symbol, so my first guess on <br/>
that would be a targeted Disenchant to de-buff enemies (or maybe de-charm <br/>
friends?).  If it can remove charm, it could be very handy against certain <br/>
creatures.  (I just love getting beat up by my own party&#39;s Monk when <br/>
fighting the Diviner in Cazic...)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the song is in Freeport by the way.  There are new songs in Kelethin, <br/>
Freeport, and Erudin.  I haven&#39;t had the chance to check Qeynos or Highpass <br/>
yet.<br/>
