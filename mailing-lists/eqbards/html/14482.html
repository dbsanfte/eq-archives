<br/>
   I suppose first of all you have to identify the elements in the<br/>
   paintings.  There are white creatures (small), there are white<br/>
   creatures (bigger, but are they the same thing?), there are brown<br/>
   things (small, usually laying down) and brown creatures that are<br/>
   bigger possibly the same thing but standing up.  Then there is this<br/>
   doglike creature, much bigger than the rest.<br/>
<br/>
   Some figures are laying down (as if dead), some have weapons,<br/>
   some are dancing, some are running, some are chasing others<br/>
   while others are being chased.<br/>
<br/>
   Back to #13, lots of dead? brown creatures, one of them has <br/>
   yellow glowing eyes, while the small white creatures appear<br/>
   to be dancing? around it?  Truly weird.<br/>
<br/>
