Ok, more than 2 words &lt;G&gt;.  Your songs are your strong point, not your<br/>
melee skills.  If you think what you bring to a group is your melee<br/>
abilities, then you&#39;re playing the wrong class.  Grab a spare flute, and<br/>
you can invis down most dungeons.  Sure, in combat you&#39;re just going to<br/>
sit back and do absolutely nothing because having to pull stuff off you<br/>
would make you a liability, but your utility songs are still extremely<br/>
useful when you&#39;re naked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	I read your argument, and to me you just basically said &quot;I would<br/>
not choose to be bound outside a dungeon because that&#39;s how it always<br/>
worked.&quot;  I fail to see the logic in that.<br/>
	I agree, that&#39;s how it works, no one is disputing that.  But is<br/>
that the best way?  No.  If you were bound right outside the dungeon, <br/>
you&#39;d be assisting with corpse retrieval with mana song all the way down.<br/>
The only reason that&#39;s the way it works now is because you cannot be<br/>
bound right outside the dungeon.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Certainly not.  You get them a decent weapon (magician summoned<br/>
weapons are actually quite good) and they stay off their taunt button, and<br/>
they are still a very signifigant source of damage, with enough hit points<br/>
where a cleric can keep them alive if they pull stuff on them for some<br/>
reason.  Yes, for some things you&#39;ll need outside help (Efreeti is the<br/>
best example I can think of right now, cause you can get past the bugs<br/>
withh 2 naked groups, but the imps and elementals will be rough), but I&#39;ve<br/>
been on numerous Fire Giant and Efreeti corpse retrievals, both as the<br/>
group who needed retrieval, and as the help, and the naked people never<br/>
died (at least not under my supervision as cleric).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Granted I haven&#39;t played my bard in about a month except for special<br/>
&gt; events like dragon hunts so maybe these dungeons are so overcamped now<br/>
&gt; you can just wander down to the hand room naked to get your body, but it<br/>
&gt; certainly wasn&#39;t like that when I did play, and binding near the dungeon<br/>
&gt; would have been a waste of time when I did.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Last time I walked into Lower Guk... A group at the zone line, a<br/>
group at the bedroom, a group at the gibs, a group in the assassin&#39;s room,<br/>
a group in the savant room, a group at the magi, a group at frenzied.  And<br/>
that&#39;s just the undead side... * sigh *  But I digress.  But a parting<br/>
thought.  Even if you don&#39;t contribute to the retrieval party (which I<br/>
think is a mistake), you should be at the zone line to give mana song to<br/>
the casters in your party who are going back in (since they are probably<br/>
needing mana).  You can be ressed from the zone line just as well as you<br/>
can be ressed from town, but you have a lot more options when you&#39;re at<br/>
the zone line.<br/>
