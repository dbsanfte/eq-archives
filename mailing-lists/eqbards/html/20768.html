<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036770829">Favorite emotes? Since Minda is mischievious in nature, and more than a  <br/>
little roguish, I will use these during downtime:<br/>
<br/>
/e sidles up to &lt;name&gt; and slyly relieves him of his wallet.<br/>
<br/>
/e hands &lt;name&gt; back his empty wallet saying, &quot;I found this, is it yours?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
/e looks innocent.<br/>
<br/>
I also lift boots, shields, armor, weapons...all the while protesting <br/>
ignorance of how such items came to be in my possession.<br/>
<br/>
It can take anyone who has not grouped with me before by surprise <br/>
sometimes.. and those that know me grin and chuckle while Minda &quot;rolls&quot; the <br/>
newcomer for his &quot;cash&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I reserve these emotes for necros and male dwarves, respectively:<br/>
<br/>
For necros: /e paints yellow happy faces all over &lt;name&#39;s&gt; robe.<br/>
<br/>
For male dwarves: /e ties pink bows in &lt;name&#39;s&gt; beard.<br/>
<br/>
I almost always get roleplaying responses in return, and its highly <br/>
entertaining to see reactions ;-)<br/>
