<div id="ygrps-yiv-361606249"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    I too wish Lambent was nodrop, I&#39;m tired of seeing level 10 bards<br/>
&gt;    running around in partial or (god forbid) full blue.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Y&#39;know, twinking never bothered me before...  but the other night I was in<br/>
Everfrost and someone did a /yell for help.  I turned around to assist<br/>
and there was a Bard in full bluebecite fighting an Orc Shaman.  I was<br/>
puzzled until I /conned him green to me at 19th.  He had a pack of friends<br/>
with him as well casting heals.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never not assisted someone in trouble before (although it has sometimes<br/>
cost me a life) but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to help out this fellow<br/>
Bard...<br/>
<br/>
Still couldn&#39;t figure out where he&#39;d got it.  This was a while ago, back when<br/>
Genni wasn&#39;t in the game and most of the people on the list were trying to<br/>
figure out how to get some.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel your pain, lower level bards.  You get bronze now at such <br/>
&gt; an early age and so cheap, after wearing it for 5 - 10 levels you<br/>
&gt; desparately want an upgrade path and there is none.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s where I am now.  Low 20&#39;s, where many of the songs are nothing to look<br/>
forward to (Mellifluous Motion) and I&#39;m making decent money now and looking<br/>
to upgrade equipment.  Big gap though between what I have now (full Bronze,<br/>
Dragoon dirk and Combine LS) and the next step up...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a part-time player and it&#39;s hard for me to put together a big group.<br/>
Last night we actually had a fair number of people on and were killing<br/>
Griffennes in N Karana.  Of course, the only Charm of the evening was looted<br/>
by the Wizard... Grr.<br/>
