<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057134619"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I can verify that this is not the case - as I said, I log into a friends<br/>
&gt; account, and were there a password stored, I&#39;d&#39;ve seen it during one of my<br/>
&gt; numerous &quot;snoopings&quot; into the EQ directory ;)  What *is* stored is your<br/>
&gt; station name, so this is very likely how the name was retrieved.  My bet is<br/>
&gt; BO or BO2000, both courtesy of Cult of the Dead Cow.  Back Orifice is<br/>
&gt; really really nasty when implemented properly.  As always, abstinence is<br/>
&gt; the best protection: never download anything you don&#39;t know for certain<br/>
&gt; what it is.<br/>

installed the MS Back Office which does exactly the same thing (though<br/>
not as elegantly) and it&#39;s their way of discouraging play from work.  I<br/>
know that some IT folks are subtle when they want to stop some<br/>
things...the IT guy where I work was notorious for that. :)<br/>
