<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544159263">I don&#39;t know exactly about your server but I take it you are talking about<br/>
the Tesch Mas Gnolls around the entrance to Splitpaw and not any of the<br/>
gnolls inside. Consistently on CT I find 1 or 2 groups doing the front<br/>
inside gnolls and 1 or 2 high level necros in the Ishva&#39;s room. The rest of<br/>
the place is clear.<br/>

	Good Journey<br/>

the last four days, I&#39;ve seen<br/>
exactly three, and one of them was dead.  I have also seen zero Griffons.<br/>
The new Gnolls are fully<br/>
camped, the Spectres have three groups sitting around the lake, Kithicor is<br/>
(as I predicted) utterly<br/>
uncamped yet still a killer to move through half the time.  Bah!  I hate<br/>
being level 35 on an aging and<br/>
crowded server.<br/>
