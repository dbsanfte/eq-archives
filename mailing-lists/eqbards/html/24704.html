can already do that on the red servers...just take that and make it global =/<br/>

&gt; &gt;  I replied that this will really hurt bards. We will lose the services<br/>
&gt; &gt;of our pets for a short amount of time, will have to charm more (more<br/>
&gt; &gt;mana) and will take more damage because of pets having to be targeted<br/>
&gt; &gt;each attack.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I suggested that they consider lengthening the amount of time a<br/>
&gt; &gt;successful Charm lasts as a way of compensation.. even 5 seconds would<br/>
&gt; &gt;be helpful...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What a coincidence. I suggested the same thing, lengthening the duration of<br/>
&gt; charm. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The change will require an adjustment of &quot;socials&quot; keys for me, especially<br/>
&gt; in a group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; /assist &lt;tank&gt;<br/>
&gt; /pet attack<br/>
&gt; /g My pet is attacking %t<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; For solo kiting, you may need to issue a /pet follow command now as instead<br/>
&gt; of automatically following like regular pets, they do like to wander off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While I&#39;m not happy with the change, I do not believe it totally ruins solo<br/>
&gt; charm kiting. However, it does make it more difficult and you will<br/>
&gt; definitely take more damage as you try to reacquire your pet&#39;s target<br/>
&gt; before it clobbers you.<br/>
