  I want a Nostrolo Tambourine ..so does anyone know about the &quot;Lost<br/>
Coin&quot; quest ?<br/>
<br/>
  Also, got challenged by a Rogue that wanted me to go to weapons<br/>
instead of an all instrument Chant of Flame and Fulfil&#39;s Curtailing<br/>
Chant... (Think she wanted the MOBS to turn their back on her.. hehe :)<br/>

Lullaby.. but who wouldn&#39;t :)</div>
