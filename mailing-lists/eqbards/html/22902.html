<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657429685">This came from a UK on line newspaper article.  Interesting.  We can<br/>
empathize with the nerfs and hope to never see the hacks(excepts for Guides<br/>
and GM&#39;s on a rampage).<br/>

Players of the online fantasy game Diablo II must wait almost a week for<br/>
their characters to be restored after a hack attack, developer Blizzard<br/>
Entertainment revealed this morning, Andrew Smith writes. <br/>
Hackers reportedly exploited a weakness in Blizzard&#39;s servers to gain access<br/>
to player accounts. By repeatedly attempting to login as another player,<br/>
they caused the authorisation process to fail, which then granted access. <br/>
They then took control of the player&#39;s character and stripped it of<br/>
equipment and bonus items. In some cases the characters were killed. <br/>
The hack seems to have been targeted at characters of a high skill level<br/>
with valuable items and experience points. Such characters will have been<br/>
built up over many months of playing, often for hours each day. <br/>
Blizzard announced this morning: &quot;Monday, January 8, we will be reviving all<br/>
hardcore characters who died between December 19th and January 1st. The<br/>
restored hardcore characters will be revived with the experience, skills and<br/>
items possessed as of Tuesday, December 19th.&quot; <br/>
This is an embarrassing incident for Blizzard, and follows months of<br/>
petitions and protests about bugs and unbalanced gameplay in what is one of<br/>
the best-selling titles of recent years. <br/>
In August, changes to the skill system in Diablo II left some players with<br/>
severely weakened characters. Many complained that hundreds of hours<br/>
invested in the game had gone to waste. <br/>
Blizzard was also criticised for not notifying players of key changes made<br/>
to the game rules until after they had been exposed by fan sites.<br/>
