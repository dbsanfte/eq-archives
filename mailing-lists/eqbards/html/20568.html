&gt;No chains, No fear.  Sure DDD, and CoD do decent damage but avoiding adds<br/>
&gt;was impossible nearly at that level range.  Now had Lullaby been working I<br/>
&gt;imagine I could have pulled it off, but those levels were horrific for me<br/>

up to about 20.  that&#39;s with instruments.  now i use largos/cod/ddd at 21.  i&#39;ve<br/>
soloed warders and defenders in cazic and dry bones and ghouls in south ro recently.<br/>
oh, you probly won&#39;t be able to do defenders unless you are twinked.  i&#39;m pretty<br/>
well twinked cuz i left a lot of equipment from my level 50 bard when i switched<br/>
servers.  mostly lambent except for ssb/azure sleeves.<br/>

&gt;I found that soloing those levels was nigh on impossible, and grouping with<br/>
&gt;pickup groups was even more suicidal.  Invariably I&#39;d die 3 or 4 times and<br/>
&gt;end up barely breaking even for the evening.  Biggest problem for me at<br/>
&gt;those levels was that if anyone in the group screwed up, the instant result<br/>
&gt;was 1 dead bard.  Didn&#39;t matter what the screwup was, bad pull, out of<br/>
&gt;control pet, linkdead tank, etc. End result was 1 dead bard and possibly 1<br/>
&gt;or 2 other deaths.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, the only way every mistake ended up with 1 dead bard is if that bard either<br/>
wasn&#39;t paying attention to the individual situation or didn&#39;t know how to adapt to<br/>
the situation.  just as one example, what did you do when there was a bad pull?<br/>
i would break out weapons and just bellow at my current level of 21.  at 23, i might<br/>
twist bellow and chains.  another thing that is important is knowing when to run for<br/>
the zone and to just do it once the call goes out.  in the 18-21 level range you should<br/>
be able to tank some on single pulls even with bronze armor.  if there is a 3 or 4 mob<br/>
pull and the only tank goes ld, then just call out for everyone to zone and go.<br/>
