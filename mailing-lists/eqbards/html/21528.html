<div id="ygrps-yiv-73694963">My current active band &quot;Professor John and His Band&quot; has release on first<br/>
CD! It is available for $15 + shipping at our website www.professorjohn.com<br/>
(sorry but I don&#39;t have any more comp copies available - they all went to<br/>
family members).<br/>
<br/>
We will probably have clips available on our site - and perhaps a cut or two<br/>
on MP3.com or some such - but haven&#39;t had time to really decide on this type<br/>
of stuff yet.<br/>
<br/>
This band plays New Orleans&#39;s R&B - Professor Longhair, Fats Domino type<br/>
stuff...<br/>
<br/>
As far as earlier releases:<br/>
<br/>
Last year I recorded a CD with Sam Burckhardt a Swing/Blues Tenor<br/>
Saxophonist. (However I&#39;m only on four cuts) Info at his website<br/>
www.thechicagoswing.com It&#39;s an excellent CD.<br/>
<br/>
My old swing band (disbanded the end of 1999) is on two compilations. &quot;Swing<br/>
This Baby Volume 2&quot; (available at Amazon<br/>
www.amazon.com/exec/obido...31-1704706 - only One cut.<br/>
<br/>
We have two cuts on Jump n Jive Chicago - available at<br/>
www.bigchicago.com/jive.htm<br/>
<br/>
I did a Big Band CD in 1994 at www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mse...1723120562<br/>
<br/>
Lastly - I wish I knew how you could get a copy of a rock band I recorded<br/>
with &quot;Obvious Necessity&quot; I did two CD&#39;s with this band. Very Frank<br/>
Zappa-esque. I lost touch with the band leader - and don&#39;t know where it&#39;s<br/>
sold..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
