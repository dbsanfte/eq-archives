&gt; PoS, through quests.  probably won&#39;t get any too soon at level 50 tho, but<br/>
&gt; the one that caught my eye was &quot;harmonic spear.&quot;  no joke.  now i KNOW you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t wait to wield that baby.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ooooh. ;-)  I didn&#39;t get the evensong yet, I was being hypothetical<br/>

  the people who broke hate this time died like 6-8 times, since the<br/>
  1) change to the plane, and 2) change to the L50 cap.  Lots of people<br/>
  lost levels while I was happily twinking my druid.<br/>
