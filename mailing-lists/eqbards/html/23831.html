Chanter #1 is being played, and died doing his job.<br/>
<br/>
Chanter #2 is there only because someone has multiple computers with<br/>
multiple accounts, and is doing nothing, and continued to do nothing despite<br/>
the fact that your group was being overrun, and was even gated out safe and<br/>
sound.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit surprised that the leader of a guild that attracts people such as<br/>
yourself would be the center of such a disagreement.  Granted, I don&#39;t know<br/>
your guild leader, but I do know you, and I supposed I&#39;ve always assumed<br/>
that your conduct is representative of Excalibur.  :)  I&#39;m sure this has<br/>
caused strife internally, as threats to walk should not be taken lightly.  A<br/>
momentary lapse of reason, perhaps?<br/>

<br/>
Hail bards and bardettes,<br/>
<br/>
 We had a loot rights discussion this weekend. We had 2 groups together in<br/>
Howling Stones North Tower. One group had a L44 chanter, a 50s shaman, a 50s<br/>
warrior, 50s cleric all played by 2 people plus a 50s wiz. The chanter<br/>
really didn&#39;t function as a chanter and we&#39;d asked them not to bring her<br/>
along as we had a real working chanter in our group. We got to the last<br/>
corner before the Crypt keeper&#39;s room and when the monk pulled it, the whole<br/>
room came. We killed the Crypt Keeper but had alot of mobs on us. Our<br/>
chanter was doing his best to pause/mez what he could. Then the hallway<br/>
started to respawn and we had 8 -10 mobs. Our chanter died, I was doing what<br/>
I could but out numbered by live awake mobs. We called for gates and the<br/>
other groups wiz got them out. We all died. The necro in our group looted<br/>
the chanter robe (Siren&#39;s?) off the keeper before he died and I got the key<br/>
before I died rather than have it poof. The aftermath was they wanted to<br/>
lotto the robe between the chanter twink and the chanter who died doing CC.<br/>
We felt this would be very wrong yet they didn&#39;t see it. We felt the twink,<br/>
while there when the robe dropped, was not being played, else we probably<br/>
would not have been wiped out. We also all know that char is a twink, not a<br/>
primary. I think that robe on a twink would hurt our guild&#39;s credibility<br/>
somewhat as the twink belongs to the head of the guild. It&#39;s also our<br/>
opinion you can&#39;t function as a good chanter unless the person is giving the<br/>
character their whole attention. I&#39;d like to hear the opinion of others on<br/>
this. Were we out of line?<br/>
The result was I said we&#39;d walk on the guild if they insisted on lottoing<br/>
it. They agreed to give the robe to the other chanter.<br/>
