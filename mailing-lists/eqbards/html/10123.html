A bard soloing a blue at 35th!  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
At 32nd with maxed 1HB and maxed 1HS, a Staff of Writhing and a Silvery War<br/>
Axe I can kill a light blue if nothing abnormal happens and he&#39;s not a<br/>
caster.  Taking on a blue or deep blue would be tantamount to suicide, at<br/>
best very, very risky.  For me a solid blue mob would be a Lizard Fanatic in<br/>
Cazic-Thule.  It would pound me into the mud one-on-one.  No question.  On<br/>
the other hand, a light blue would be a gator in the sewers.  I *can* solo<br/>
one of those.<br/>
<br/>
So you know how I chose to kill a Fan?  I group and play Hymn, Anthem,<br/>
Binding, Clarity, Pixie Strike, Lullaby, etc.  People like to have me in a<br/>
group because of all the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; stuff that I/we do.  No<br/>
enchanter? - Pixie Strike that Herald while the meleers in the group kill<br/>
the Page.<br/>
<br/>
To kill a solid blue mob a 35th bard would have to do a bit more than &quot;kite<br/>
a little&quot; to be comfortable.  They&#39;d have to GROUP.<br/>

&gt; nothing special.  I have an observer staff and am maxed (I think) for my<br/>
&gt; level in 2H blunt.  And all I have to say is that buffed up to the hilt, I<br/>
&gt; can MAYBE solo a blue in melee (not using DOT and DD)...but I doubt it.<br/>
&gt; This is strict melee.  Even when I use my spells, I still need to kite a<br/>
&gt; little to be comfortable.  My bard is only 17 and does just fine on a<br/>
&gt; blue... I don&#39;t know how she will be at 35 yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		I guess my point (do I have one here?) is that my bard kicks<br/>
&gt; ass in melee compared to my shaman (can&#39;t say about other hybrid<br/>
&gt; classes or<br/>
&gt; about other bards or other shaman).  Shaman are best at niche filling -<br/>
&gt; turning the tide of battle in our favor, whether by buffing,<br/>
&gt; debuffing or a<br/>
&gt; nicely placed heal or DD.  Maybe bards are best at that too, with a slight<br/>
&gt; emphasis on getting in there and fighting.  But if my shaman is<br/>
&gt; taking hits,<br/>
&gt; I crumple just about as fast as a wizard :-)<br/>

&gt; 				If you jump off a 10 story building you will<br/>

&gt; 				If you jump off a 10 story building you will<br/>
&gt; die.  That is not a fact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 				You are the only person I know who does not<br/>
&gt; know the difference between a<br/>
&gt; 				fact and an opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 				Maybe Bards eventually become better than<br/>
&gt; Shamans in melee, but not at level<br/>
&gt; 				17.  Dual wield was not sufficient to<br/>
&gt; prevent me from being pummeled due to<br/>
&gt; 				the numerous stuns I received.  All shamans<br/>
&gt; have slam.  Sure it never goes<br/>
&gt; 				up, but it is still sufficient to stun a<br/>
&gt; 17th level bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 				Bards are better than all hybrids in magical<br/>
&gt; power?  Under what microscope<br/>
&gt; 				did you determine that?  At lower levels its<br/>
&gt; obviously true as the other<br/>
&gt; 				hybrids have no magical power.  Hmm lets<br/>
&gt; examine them at higher levels.<br/>
&gt; 				Paladin get Greater Heal, 400 hp that&#39;s 3<br/>
&gt; minutes worth of Hymn with a lute<br/>
&gt; 				and it takes them less time than that to<br/>
&gt; meditate back the mana.  They also<br/>
&gt; 				get Revive at their utmost level of spell<br/>
&gt; use.  Not to mention Lay Hands.<br/>
&gt; 				Rangers probably have the weakest line of<br/>
&gt; spells getting nothing above Heal,<br/>
&gt; 				though they do get Wolf Form, cool but not<br/>
&gt; overly powerful.  Shadowknights<br/>
&gt; 				spells are fearsome.  The Engulfing Darkness<br/>
&gt; DoT line is devastating as it<br/>
&gt; 				destroys our best defense, Acellerando and<br/>
&gt; it stacks with their Heat Blood.<br/>
&gt; 				They also now have the lifetap series.  All<br/>
&gt; this aside their Harm Touch<br/>
&gt; 				alone is a devastating if slow to recharge<br/>
&gt; weapon.  We do have a greater<br/>
&gt; 				number of spells than the other hybrids do<br/>
&gt; though.  Are our abilities<br/>
&gt; 				obviously better, I would not say so.<br/>
&gt; Better in a full group of six maybe,<br/>
&gt; 				better in small groups, that&#39;s not apparent.<br/>
&gt; Even if we were better it<br/>
&gt; 				certainly would not be 5-6 times better and<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s how the other hybrids<br/>
&gt; 				relate to us in terms of melee skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 				Now since I have stated that bards magical<br/>
&gt; abilities might not be so much<br/>
&gt; 				better than some of the other hybrids,<br/>
&gt; rangers excluded as their spells are<br/>
&gt; 				truly weak, feel free to call me a liar.<br/>
&gt; That will just be one more<br/>
&gt; 				definition you will need to look up on<br/>
&gt; Merriam-Webster Online, right after<br/>
&gt; 				&#39;fact&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 				To further turn your argument around:<br/>
&gt; 				Bards cannot beat any caster consistently in<br/>
&gt; pure magical combat. (though<br/>
&gt; 				I&#39;ve come close with Maxell MR)<br/>
&gt; 				Bards cannot beat any other hybrid or melee<br/>
&gt; type consistently in pure melee<br/>
&gt; 				combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 				Neither of those statements however true<br/>
&gt; prove we are weaker than those<br/>
&gt; 				classes any more than yours prove we are<br/>
&gt; equal in power.  In my opinion, we<br/>
&gt; 				are weaker than several of the other<br/>
&gt; classes.  The weakness is not generally<br/>
&gt; 				overbearing but that doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be corrected.  To be honest I<br/>
&gt; 				think a realignment of our skills would<br/>
&gt; suffice to bridge the gap without<br/>
&gt; 				modifications to our spells other than<br/>
&gt; including the missing ones and fixing<br/>
&gt; 				the broken ones.  An added melee skill like<br/>
&gt; Parry which succeeds more often<br/>
&gt; 				than Dodge, and some raised caps on skills<br/>
&gt; that are currently of debatable<br/>
&gt; 				usefulness would help as well.  Most<br/>
&gt; Jack-of-all-trades are seen as<br/>
&gt; 				self-sufficient characters while we are<br/>
&gt; definitely not designed to be very<br/>
&gt; 				capable on our own.  We do best in groups<br/>
&gt; due to the nature of our spells.<br/>
&gt; 				It is this very grouping nature that further<br/>
&gt; undermines the usefulness of<br/>
&gt; 				our other skills as there will often be<br/>
&gt; present others in the group whose<br/>
&gt; 				skill so far overshadows ours in those other<br/>
&gt; areas that we might as well not<br/>
&gt; 				have the skill at all. There is no benefit<br/>
&gt; to having Find Traps and Pick<br/>
&gt; 				Locks when there is a rogue in the group<br/>
&gt; with more than double your skill.<br/>
&gt; 				If we were meant to be characters who could<br/>
&gt; function on their own and do<br/>
&gt; 				nearly everything, if not well, that would<br/>
&gt; be different.  However, we are<br/>
&gt; 				not.  We are meant to group and for every<br/>
&gt; member we add to our group some of<br/>
&gt; 				our skills become superfluous just as our<br/>
&gt; magical powers become more potent.<br/>

&gt; 				&gt;     Just curious, what server do you play<br/>

&gt; 				&gt; generally flamebait.  I&#39;ll be the first to<br/>
&gt; defend your right to free<br/>
&gt; 				speech<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; however I would ask that you perhaps<br/>
&gt; temper somewhat your future remarks<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; with the fact this is a public forum meant<br/>
&gt; for discussion -- closing doors<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; via naked accusations and bombastic<br/>
