Dungeon Touchups/Revamps: We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for<br/>
some of the dungeons in the world. Our last patch included an updated<br/>
Runnyeye complete with new monsters and treasures to be plundered. Next on<br/>
the list is Permafrost Keep. Lady Vox has been in the mood to do some<br/>
redecorating of her lair, which includes replacing some of her more<br/>
lackwitted minions. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is<br/>
released.<br/>

Would be nice if they made it hard enough to be properly tuned to remove the<br/>
level cap; yet in range with the capabilities of the majority of players&#39;<br/>
guilds/alliances to take on.  (Some may argue with me - but Gorenaire IMHO<br/>
is too difficult for the majority of the players to have ANY chance to go<br/>
after)<br/>
