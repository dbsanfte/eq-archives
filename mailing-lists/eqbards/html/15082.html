<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282571871">I use disenchanting melody to remove Dark elf illusion. I do not always like<br/>
to have it on. Nice to get rid of debuffs in PVP;)<br/>

&gt;Can&#39;t say that I have ever groupped with anybody that said...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;...my god kerouac - thank god your here... please play that see invis song<br/>
&gt;please&quot;<br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;&quot;...wow, never knew bards could sing a so I could see invis - cool&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t most casters get see invis WAY before  lvl 24?  And most humans have<br/>
&gt;found a way to deal with the night vision by lvl 24,<br/>
&gt;unless there is a recent death involved...  That&#39;s what I mean when I say<br/>
&gt;useless...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm I do not think the recently deceased Human who is bumping around in the<br/>
dark would agree with you here...  Also people with dark video equipment<br/>
(graphics card and/or monitor) find this useful as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There is no doubt alot of our songs are specialized, like the psalm &gt;series<br/>
&gt;and such... but, there are about 6 uselss -  they are TOO specialized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;MMM,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In Dueling and PvP this song is great.  Also handy to quickly get down from<br/>
very high places without dying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Disenchanting,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This song is useless so 1 point for you. :p<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Identify<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try to complete the Lambent armor quests without this one.  Also i have a<br/>
feeling that many more quests will have items in the future that need to be<br/>
identified.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;jump right to mind, am I to toss the lvl 24<br/>
&gt;song into that same heap now?  Can they be used, yes... are they<br/>
&gt;useful - I have not found them useful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just because you find something useless does not mean the rest of us do.  I<br/>
know of people that even find Disenchanting Melody useful.  Usually in a<br/>
Melee heavy group without a buffer from what I have heard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I just think that if Verant is gonna limit our songs to 50, and then<br/>
&gt;not really implement 50... that there shouldn&#39;t be that many lemons...<br/>
