&gt; Well, don&#39;t feel bad.  I&#39;m level 58, and I didn&#39;t realize <br/>
&gt; that our mez overwrites theirs (and can&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; overwritten by theirs) until this weekend.  Luckily, I didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; get us all killed, but the Enchanter did get<br/>
&gt; really snippy.  Shows how often I group with Enchanters.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the explanation.  i asked one of the Bard mains <br/>
&gt; in my guild and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they were like &quot;It is, it sucks, go make a post about it&quot; <br/>
&gt; lol.  Seems really<br/>
&gt; &gt; stupid to me that it works that way.  Makes me feel bad cuz <br/>
&gt; i was trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; help our chanter mez like 6 things and I just made it so he <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t and we<br/>
&gt; &gt; all died.  *shrug* guess you have to learn the hard way sometimes :)<br/>
