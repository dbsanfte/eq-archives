<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-897606167">Hmm well I know for a fact at least for me that 25 was no diffrent from any<br/>
other hell level. Of course on my other char I started killing treeants from<br/>
21-30. Through all those levels but level 30 I gained exp the same amount.<br/>
Usually a level a day if I put in a good amount of time. However 30 did take<br/>
3 days at the treeants so it was quite obvious 30 was a hell level.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me it doesn&#39;t get any better currently my other char ( a necro ) hit<br/>
35 about 3 weeks ago. For some reason I chose that level to die over and<br/>
over. Everytime I got within two bubbles of leveling I would go and die two<br/>
times in a row. In fact overall I probably died at least 12 times :(.<br/>
Luckily I usually got a res. Still it&#39;s a pain to get through but the<br/>
satisfaction is good when you finish the level.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; 25 is a mini-hell.  Most people don&#39;t notice it, but I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; estimate it took me about 70% longer to get through it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ack say it isn&#39;t so =(.  I dinna want it to be so.  THough I think it is<br/>
&gt;&gt; noticable in Unrest since the mobs are mostly blue to me now.  Perhaps 25<br/>
&gt;&gt; is one of those inbetween levels where most things are green or even =(.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Time to check Mistmoore then.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; At 31 you lose about a bubble per death (vs. about 1/4-1/3 at<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 30 and 32).  If you tend to have a high number of deaths per<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; level as I know many of you do, this can really screw you up.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Whereas before you were taking 5 steps forward and 2 steps<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; back for a net gain of 3 steps a night, at 31 this can turn<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; into 5 steps forward and 6 steps back for a net loss of 1 step<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; a night, even though you are gaining experience and dying at<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the exact same rate as before.  I hear this holds true for all<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; hell-levels + 1.<br/>
