<div id="ygrps-yiv-899697846">disco 2 is the commander/brogg/pickler area behind the door on the platform in<br/>
disco.  there&#39;s a door behind where grup spawns and it&#39;s back in that area.<br/>

&gt;that a Bard would be sufficient (without a level 60 puller, as Jeffrey wrote).  I&#39;d repeated that based on<br/>
&gt;comments I&#39;d received in game.  We would have been dead/evaced at least four times.  Thank goodness for level<br/>

&gt; &gt; having spent all weekend in dicso 2 and breaking disco on the way in, i think disco would only<br/>
&gt; &gt; be doable with a level 60 puller.  disco 2 you might be able to get away with a bard charming if<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;ve also got a necro or a pally/cleric who is good at rooting stuff away from the fight.  in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;&#39;library&#39;&#39; (what a cool looking room btw) we had a couple fights where we ended up killing 6 in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the same fight, but we also had some where we were able to kill 2, then 1 more, then a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; roamers in separate fights.<br/>
