&gt; &gt; Even though I really like our guild Robynn, I have learned not to rely on<br/>
&gt; &gt; them for anything.  I realize your not saying that you do...but if I find<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself grouped with a guildmate its usually because of coincidence.  No one<br/>
&gt; &gt; from our guild has ever come to my aid because I asked, only if it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; convenient.<br/>

&gt; This is kind of a shame; maybe you need a new guild.  I spent a lot of the last <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the main problem with mine and Faras&#39;s guild is that for quite<br/>
some time, they invited in anyone who asked, so people who are mostly<br/>
solo&#39;ers got in and really don&#39;t participate in the guild.  The main<br/>
players in the guild are a group of friends from MN, and while they<br/>
are very friendly, they seem to keep to themselves a lot.  I have, on<br/>
occasion, gotten great deals on items and even some for free...but so<br/>
far that&#39;s about all the guild&#39;s been good for.  Until I find a guild<br/>
on our server that is truly what I&#39;m looking for (or break down and<br/>
try to make it myself), I&#39;m content to have it the way it is.  I do<br/>
ask on guild if anyone wants to join a group when I&#39;m looking for<br/>
replacements, but I rarely get any answers.  Oh, and Faras, the third<br/>
person in my regular group is a member of the guild, but has the same<br/>
beefs with it I do.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone on E&#39;ci know anyone who wants to help start a guild? =)<br/>
