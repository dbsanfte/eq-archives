<div id="ygrps-yiv-688892793">Yea, I&#39;ve heard that, however until our bard gets chains, we are kind<br/>
out of options.  We had a a Ranger AND a druid in our original group,<br/>
but the Druid is 32 (to our 18) now and the Ranger has not played in two<br/>
months...  With the two potential people coming in, I told them to make<br/>
the character they want, not what we need.  Given the choice, I think i<br/>
wanted a druid and another tank to fill out the group (still no<br/>
enchanter, but we can make do with the bard)<br/>

&gt; In my experience, the darkness line is inferior to snare.<br/>
&gt; Stuff with darkness on it will start to run *before* the<br/>
&gt; darkness will halt their movement.  So they&#39;ll still manage to<br/>
&gt; flee a bit depending on how quickly you&#39;re damaging it.<br/>
&gt; Early on Chain acts pretty much like snare.  But later (level<br/>
&gt; thirty-something?) it will stop runners when they&#39;re at half<br/>
&gt; hp.  That makes it superior to snare for stopping green<br/>
&gt; runners, since greenies tend to run when they drop below half.<br/>
