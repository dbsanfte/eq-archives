<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703792480">About 3 weeks ago I bought a Barbed Leather Whip for 35pp - good deal - guy<br/>
was asking 50pp but I guess he wanted the cash.´┐¢ I like it a lot!´┐¢ Usually<br/>
have it in my primary - so it snaps each round and a dirk in my off hand.<br/>
Sometimes I have BLW in off hand and Ashenwood Short Stabber in primary.´┐¢<br/>
But for serious action I go with the Ash stabber and Dirk.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Last night, I traded a Shiney Brass Halbred and 150pp for a PGT and this was<br/>
right in HighHold Pass.´┐¢ I guess I really wanted that Polish Garnet<br/>
Tommychopper!!!<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Are the stats worth 200pp?´┐¢ <br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Barb Leather Whip 50pp<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
PGT 250pp<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
The look alone... &quot;Priceless!&quot;<br/>

Anyone on Innoruuk want to trade their Staff of Writhing (and some plat) for<br/>
a Glowing Stein?<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Shield of the Slain Unicorn, anyone? I got a line on one at a great price<br/>
and NO - no we did NOT kill or hurt any unicorns to get this.<br/>

p.s. we did a corpse recovery in Paw last night - actually took two nights.´┐¢<br/>
In the end Rilla (guide) had to drag it out from under some terrain.´┐¢ I<br/>
looked at her stuffs - with her permission of course -- and will be posting<br/>
some screen shots - talk about twinked!!!!´┐¢ She had some really cool rares.<br/>

I know this has been gone over already, but since now that I am getting<br/>
close to the affording range I would like some more Info on it.´┐¢ My stats<br/>
right now are: 104 strength (big improvement over 85 eh?) 94 agility,<br/>
111dex, 90 charisma, 80 int, 60 wisdom.<br/>
´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ Because I am moving onto mobs that carry pricier loot and I in turn am<br/>
racking up more cash I have to wonder once again, which is better for me?<br/>
The Polished Granite Tomahawk, or the Barbed Leather whip?´┐¢ I have asked a<br/>
number of high level bards on my server, and have gotten conflicting<br/>
answers...´┐¢ I have been leaning over to the Barbed Leather whip side of<br/>
things, but because I have a pretty good dex I was wondering if maybe<br/>
because I would proc more on the PGT, the tommy would be a better choice.´┐¢ I<br/>
have got about 80pp in the bank right now, but I have started working on<br/>
Lake Rathe and Permafrost, and have been getting sizable donations for<br/>
healing and Taxi rides, as well as Teaching Elder dragon, and a friend of<br/>
mine and I are starting a heavy duty jewelering biz, so My new fortune is<br/>
not far off.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Thank you for all your help, and please don&#39;t over reply to this... I would<br/>
hate to start a Giant thread.<br/>

p.s. A guildmate of mine gave me the BI crown he looted off a Goblin Warlord<br/>
for trade for my Bronze helm!´┐¢ I nearly pissed myself when he offered the<br/>
trade...</div>
