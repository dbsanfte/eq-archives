<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607056940">Here is what I have gathered for this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 20, full Bronze and I wield a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
and a Combine Scimitar (gotta LOVE trading GL&#39;s in<br/>
North Karana...made a LOT of cash last week).<br/>
<br/>
I fought Gorge Hounds in East Karana to test things. <br/>
All are blue to me, seldom Dangerous...most Risky.  I<br/>
picked a Risky one and attacked it with Weapons,<br/>
twisting DDD, Chords and Hymn.  After 5 of them (can&#39;t<br/>
do a valid test with only ONE subject), average health<br/>
loss each time was 2 bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
Put weapons in backpack, wielded Horn with Lute on<br/>
pointer.  Twisted same three songs, flipping Lute and<br/>
Horn at appropriate times (my GOD!  I have NEVER been<br/>
so busy in my life...hehe).  After five hounds,<br/>
average health loss each time was a little UNDER one<br/>
bubble.  I was nearly ready to go immediately after<br/>
making the kill.<br/>
<br/>
Next, I tried to take on 2 Hounds at once....a little<br/>
harder to do.  Taking them on with weapons, twice I<br/>
made it to the zone, once I won the fight with a<br/>
little over 1 1/2 bubbles remaining.  I decided to NOT<br/>
try this test again...hehe<br/>
<br/>
Later on, I got mobbed by two again.  Decided to try<br/>
to take them without weapons and get at least ONE<br/>
valid test in.  Killed both, ended with 3 full bubbles<br/>
of health left.  Didn&#39;t do this again, so I can&#39;t<br/>
confirm averages here.<br/>
<br/>
After that, I joined some members of my guild for a<br/>
trip to Runnyeye.  Entered, turned the corner, and got<br/>
creamed by Borxx (someone trained him and didn&#39;t<br/>
bother to shout a warning...oh well).<br/>
Entered Runnyeye again, extra tough spawn decided to<br/>
REALLY be a critic.  Heard the fateful &quot;OOM&quot; from our<br/>
Shaman....ouch!  NOW LOADING....<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I broke even and managed to complete the<br/>
tests I wanted to.  Also, my brass finally got maxed,<br/>
so the night was a success in my eyes.  Oh...I also<br/>
helped a Cleric friend get to level 19 in the Gorge. <br/>
To me, THAT was the best part of the night.<br/>
