<div id="ygrps-yiv-742331113">Heya,<br/>
<br/>
You fine folks have any suggestions for a level 6 Bard on where to hunt?<br/>
Im was born in, and live around the Qeynos area. I have been helping keep<br/>
the rat population down, and lately have been working on keeping the<br/>
dreaded Black Burrow entrance free of Scouts and Guards. However I am in<br/>
need of greater adventure. As a bard, I need great adventures to write<br/>
songs about.<br/>
<br/>
ooc: So if I help someone who is a level 23 warrior find their body, and<br/>
they give me stuff, is this considered twinking? <br/>
<br/>
ooc2: Ever notice how many of us bards have names that start with T?<br/>
