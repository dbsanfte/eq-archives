<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I drowned, I petitioned as it was the fault of the game locking up on<br/>
&gt; me. (I have since theorized that it locked up due to my video cards over<br/>
&gt; heating, though that is still a guess). <br/>

 </span></blockquote>	When I first started playing EQ, I was having the same problem with<br/>
my computer consistently locking up on me.  I have a Diamond Viper V550 RIVA<br/>
TNT card and was using the most current Diamond drivers for the card.  I<br/>
installed the Nvidia Detonator drivers at the recommendation of Verant Tech<br/>
Support (thats right, they actually responded to my email).  I have had no<br/>
problems with lockups since I installed the Detonator drivers.  If you have<br/>
a RIVA TNT card you may want to look into that as a solution to your<br/>
problem.  <br/>
