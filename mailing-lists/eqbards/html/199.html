<b>Subject:</b> Hello and Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-714006643">Hello all - I just discovered this board!  I am a half-elf Bard on Xegony.  I have been operating in the Freeport areas mostly - and hope to start some travelling in the near future...<br/>
<br/>
    I JUST made level 8 and have a few questions.  Since I just made 8 and can develop String Instruments - should I sell my drum after getting the lute?  Is there any need for both?  (Obviously a concern is carrying slots).  Is there a difference between  the lute and the mandolin?  <br/>
<br/>
    Lastly - I am always short of money.  Most of my money goes to songs - my armor is pretty thin.  Any suggestions for making money.<br/>
<br/>
    I apologize if these questions have been answered many times before - as I am new to the list.  If there is a searchable archive somewhere - please point me there!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Slyde<br/>
