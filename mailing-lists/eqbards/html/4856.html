<div id="ygrps-yiv-985052820">Ok, here are my thoughts on what Bards could use to be better.<br/>
<br/>
1. Increase some of the skill level caps.  Having abilities that are capped<br/>
at below your starting racial point is silly.  The bards that spend more<br/>
time using the skill should be able to gain in the ones they use.  Maybe<br/>
make it harder to raise the skills, but at least allow it to raise to a<br/>
reasonable level.  Not much point in getting Pick Locks at what 35th if the<br/>
only locks we would encounter at that level will always be impossible due to<br/>
our low skill cap.  Assuming they start implementing locks, which I believe<br/>
they will, given time.<br/>
<br/>
2. To bind or not to bind?  I believe we should have bind, but others<br/>
vehemently disagree.  I would favor a bind that is self only, with a mana<br/>
cost and I even like the idea of a material component like a beverage of<br/>
some kind.  This could easily be used to replace our level 14 song which is<br/>
currently nearly useless due to the decision to allow item identification to<br/>
occurr as it did in Beta.<br/>
<br/>
3. Bard specific weapons would be nice.  I like the idea of the Singing<br/>
Sword, and most classes have weapons specific to them, we do not.  Also many<br/>
classes have quests specifically tailored to their class that provide<br/>
excellent rewards once one has enough faction.  We unfortunately have only<br/>
the drum quest.  Nice, but very low level.  The Winds of Karana quest seems<br/>
really cool, but my reward was a copy of Chant of Battle.  Yeah, that&#39;s<br/>
useful, give me my starting spell again.  On the other hand I can get the<br/>
Cleric Paladin only quest weapon, the non-bard 2HB quest weapon, the warrior<br/>
only 2HS quest weapon.  Too bad my own people treat me worse than those<br/>
guys.<br/>
<br/>
4. My biggest dissapointment at becoming a bard in the beginning, went to<br/>
buy a bow only to find we cannot use them.  I could care less that they are<br/>
somewhat inefficient, I just wanted to be able to use one.  It fits into<br/>
almost every concept of a bard in fantasy literature and games, but not in<br/>
EQ?  Can&#39;t figure out why since it clearly is not unbalancing.<br/>
<br/>
5. No harmony skill.  There has to be some skill at playing the class.<br/>
Playing a bard is not twitchy.  I weave 2 songs all the time despite 500ms<br/>
ping.  Its not twitching to hit 2 keys about 6 seconds apart.<br/>
<br/>
6. I think our rogue skill should function just like rogues.  Isn&#39;t it<br/>
enough we have to wait to a high level to get what a rogue starts with?<br/>
Also sneaking while hiding should be possible once we have both skills, as<br/>
it is for rogues.<br/>
<br/>
7. Fix the z axis problem.  I hate that I can&#39;t use half my spells in any<br/>
multi level dungeon because some dazed goblin shaman two floors away heard<br/>
me, but the dazed goblin guard I can see doesn&#39;t.  Its not a feature, its a<br/>
holdover from the anti-flying code.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is 7 is all I canthink of right offhand.  I still think bards<br/>
are a great class, most of my gripes are little things.  I still hold to my<br/>
feeling that I will never play another non-binding class however.<br/>

I read a post about starting back up the bard petition.  I for one do not<br/>
like petitions but for some strange reason that seems to be the way to get<br/>
things fixed with this game.  So I wrote the original writer of the Bard<br/>
petition and he wrote me back saying &quot;If you rally some people to make new<br/>
comments, I will overhaul it and submit it to Brad&quot;.  The ball is in our<br/>
court so I was hoping to see a bunch of new comments on things we would like<br/>
to have fixed or changed with the class.<br/>
<br/>
On a personal note my Bard character is my favorite to play, and believe it<br/>
or not on the Magician mailing list everyone there complained a lot more<br/>
about there class.  I have to say though that my Mage character was a lot<br/>
more balanced than my bard.  And yet they keep helping the Mages out by<br/>
fixing their complaints.  Maybe the squeaky wheel does get oil.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions:  As my bard is still new I can offer only a few ideas to get<br/>
the ball rolling.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  My idea is<br/>
change the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to me (Stats<br/>
might be the factor) to be the better song to use over Warsong and Anthem.<br/>
I have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, there should be<br/>
no debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>
2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>
3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rouges<br/>
do.<br/>
4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand<br/>
point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a<br/>
coin.<br/>
5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was not using a<br/>
crossbow or bow?<br/>
6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only weapons that can be<br/>
used as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of<br/>
singing songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a lot of ideas<br/>
here would help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this gets the ball rolling and as viewed as a constructive way to<br/>
help solve some bard issues.<br/>
<br/>
Fair thee well friends!<br/>
