it is not a charisma song per se as has been said by others, but like you<br/>
mention it is simply a faction song.  it absolutely has a difference with a<br/>
flute.  example, in west commons i went to the inn and was told to get the<br/>
heck out.  sing carillion, get the heck out.  play carillion with a flute,<br/>

&gt; Ok, here&#39;s the deal on Carillion.  If you don&#39;t have line of<br/>
&gt; sight, it sometimes won&#39;t work.  As it says<br/>
&gt; in the various song analyses, All this does is Give you the<br/>
&gt; factions that the mob you targets has  This<br/>
&gt; can have various effects on the /con.  Most of the time, this<br/>
&gt; will improve on how they view you.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes, however, you can have better or the same faction<br/>
&gt; with them already.  Other times, the mob has<br/>
&gt; no faction, like gypsies, so the song does nothing.  This<br/>
&gt; song will not make a monster who is &quot;ready to<br/>
&gt; attack&quot; you non-aggro.  It has been debated whether using a<br/>
&gt; wind instrument has any effect on this song.<br/>
&gt; My opinion is that it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
