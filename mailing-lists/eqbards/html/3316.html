<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147352186">I believe it does Roop.  Though how much it affects your stats diminishes<br/>
to certain extent.  I have read discussions that there are some<br/>
statistical sweet spots for the various stats.  Agility apparently has a<br/>
sweetspot at 90 and then at 120.  I personally have liked my decision to<br/>
spread a good amount of my stats between AGI and DEX (I was the tank of my<br/>
first adventuring party) and it has served me well.  I usually can tank<br/>
something as well as a ranger or sometimes a paladin without buffs.  So<br/>
there is something to be said for it =).<br/>

&gt; Alas, from my rogue friend&#39;s enthusiasm about agility I had hopes that it<br/>
&gt; actually meant something.  I fear strength, indeed, is the only statistic,<br/>
&gt; and the others have little or no impact.  One would hope that if someone<br/>
&gt; actually concentrated on another statistic besides strength they would reap<br/>
&gt; some reward.  Well, one can only hope that at least for rogues, high agility<br/>
&gt; helps as she believes.  (Hey, monks have their own physics, why not others?)<br/>

&gt; &gt;My agility is 99, 117 when my ranger friend casts feet like<br/>
&gt; &gt;cat on me.  I can&#39;t say if I&#39;m that much better at avoiding<br/>
&gt; &gt;blows - if there is a difference it is subtle.  The monk list<br/>
