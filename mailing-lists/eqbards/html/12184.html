<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044867012">Doh.  I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t get a lute, but patience will out.  Try again and<br/>
you will.  I remember the first time I invised and went up to the castle.  I<br/>
was every bit as &quot;EQ scared&quot; as you were.  However, there are only a couple<br/>
of infrequent mobs that see invis inside.  Once I was exploring the castle<br/>
invisible; I was in the Music Room (which is different from the Ballroom<br/>
where the musicians spawn) and saw the little garden outside.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh cool, check this out.  Wonder what&#39;s out here?&quot;<br/>
Creeeeek...<br/>
&quot;Do not underestimate the might of Mistmoore!&quot;<br/>
A Hemo Enologist hits YOU for 48 points damage!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blah, blah, blah.  I died about 6 paces from the zone.  The Hemo Enologist<br/>
can definitely see invis.  BTW, a Hemo Enologist is one that studies the<br/>
science of making wine from blood.  I love this game (and yes, I had to look<br/>
enology up :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, something I&#39;ve been meaning to mention on the list.  I was in MM at 40<br/>
with a 50 Druid and we were trying to pick up MM drums for trade items.  I<br/>
was flabergasted when we looted MM drums (at night) from a werewolf that<br/>
spawned in Mynthi Davissi&#39;s spot.  All I can say is one green werewolf was a<br/>
whole heck of a lot easier to deal with than a charming blue caster with an<br/>
animation.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over the holidays I went to Mistmoore to try and get a gypsy lute.  When I<br/>
&gt; got there, a 50th level wizard was in the castle camping the gypsies so he<br/>
&gt; could farm battle drums for his friends.  I asked him if I could<br/>
&gt; purchase a<br/>
&gt; gypsy lute from him if one got dropped.  He said I could have it for free<br/>
&gt; assuming I got there before it decayed.  I started up the invis song and<br/>
&gt; made my way to the piano room.  I would have to say that was the<br/>
&gt; most scared<br/>
&gt; I have ever been in my whole EQ life.  No one was camping the courtyard so<br/>
&gt; as I made my way to the castle I walked past numerous ancilles, deathly<br/>
&gt; ushers, gargoyles etc.  There must have been at least 20 mobs from the<br/>
&gt; graveyard gate and castle gate.  Fortunately, my invis song stayed up the<br/>
&gt; entire time.  Made my way where the wizard was sitting and<br/>
&gt; started waiting.<br/>
&gt; I ended up sitting there for over an hour watching the wizard take out<br/>
&gt; numerous gypsies and other mobs.  To my misfortune, not once did a gypsy<br/>
&gt; drop a lute.  While fighting a werewolf, a wandering mob joined in and the<br/>
&gt; wiz had to gate out.  He then decided to go somewhere else.  I made my way<br/>
&gt; back down to safety.  I wasted an hour I could have been doing something<br/>
&gt; else but it was still fun due to the risk involved.<br/>
