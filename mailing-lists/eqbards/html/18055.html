<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131911479">I use this exact same thing pretty much...<br/>
However, I hit &#39;u&#39; to open doors and do stuff..<br/>
that might be easier than hitting a trackball button...<br/>
but then again...you may be so used to the trackball that<br/>
switching may be tough..:)<br/>

&gt; Trackball instead of mouse and I keep it literally touching the right side<br/>
&gt; of my keyboard so I can hit the button with my pinkie to open doors and<br/>
&gt; such. I only use the trackball when switching instruments / weapons,<br/>
&gt; manipulating inventory and selecting targets while mezzing or charming.<br/>

&gt; 1-6 songs<br/>

&gt; The one problem I have is that hitting shift plus a number is awkward.<br/>
