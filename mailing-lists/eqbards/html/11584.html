<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lambent Stones on E&#39;ci <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-223121821">I solod in Rathe Mts. and made HGs kill each other and took their stones.<br/>
:)  Very good money, so-so experience, and a Lambent stone.  Easy.  The only<br/>
problem nowadays is in simply finding two Hill Giants to rub together.  I<br/>
usually have to stay up kinda late.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing.  I was wanting a stone the other night for my last piece of<br/>
Lambent.  The zone was camped and I couldn&#39;t find ONE giant, much less two.<br/>
I /auc&#39;d for a stone and some jackass wanted 100pp.  I said &quot;Hey guy, I can<br/>
buy one from the INN in Rathe Mts., a 60 second run, for 48pp.&quot;  He called<br/>
me a liar of course, so I ran to the Inn and bought it for 48pp.  That&#39;s the<br/>
most I&#39;ve ever paid for a stone, but I knew it was the last one I&#39;d ever<br/>
need.  I was impatient.  :-/<br/>
