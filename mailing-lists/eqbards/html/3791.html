<div id="ygrps-yiv-336249059"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I don&#39;t think EQ has enough infrastructure to survive on a<br/>
&gt;purely social aspect.  There are no player-owned structures,<br/>
&gt;there are no player-owned merchants, there are no item sinks,<br/>
&gt;and there are very few money sinks (trade skills, steel armor)<br/>
&gt;most of which (trade skills) were an afterthought coded in<br/>
&gt;just before the game went Final.  In short, there really isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;much you can *do* in EQ which doesn&#39;t revolve around killing<br/>
&gt;monsters to gain items and experience.  You can&#39;t really make<br/>
&gt;your mark on the world.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The PvP and Racewar servers definitely have more<br/>
&gt;possibilities, but on the normal servers, socializing is not<br/>
&gt;much different from an IRC chat room.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;In that respect, UO is ahead of EQ.  I think EQ only strived<br/>
&gt;to make massively multiplayer online hack and slash FRPG.  UO<br/>
&gt;strived to make an online virtual world.  In the discussions<br/>
&gt;Brad McQuaid and Raph Koster have had, it&#39;s pretty obvious EQ<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t have as high a goal as UO.  Brad still refuses to admit<br/>
&gt;that long-term money and item sinks are necessary in a<br/>
&gt;persistent online game, to keep player ability inflation (and<br/>
&gt;thus monster difficulty deflation) in check.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is, in fact, the very reason I sort of kind of in a round about way<br/>
miss UO.  Our position in EQ as bards is nothing like that of the bards of<br/>
UO.  I remember playing as a bard in UO, I would travel town to town, tavern<br/>
to tavern and play the same annoying tunes and spam songs across the screen.<br/>
For a lot of people, I was just another annoying town cryer that was little<br/>
more than a distraction from pking.  For others I was true entertainment.<br/>
People would stand around watching me, some would even follow, and almost<br/>
all would have a small donation in hand for the wandering entertainer.  I<br/>
honestly dont know how I could even attempt at such a thing in everquest.<br/>
And even if i were able to manage a small production, how would I hope to<br/>
catch the attention of the warriors on their way to camp Drelzna for her<br/>
boots, or those hard set on reaching that next spell rank?  It&#39;s the<br/>
constant competition that kills it all for me.  Too much emphasis on<br/>
levelling and item gaining.  Once the level curve gets higher I hope we&#39;ll<br/>
start to see more people willing to stop and smell the roses.  Perhaps then<br/>
we&#39;ll begin to see some sort of sense of community that EQ sorely lacks<br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
PS - personal messaging kills social interaction too in my opinion  -=)</div>
