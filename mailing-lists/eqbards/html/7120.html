&gt; Subject: RE: Bards vs Clerics in melee<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The mere fact that there would be a MAJOR UPROAR makes it obvious that not<br/>
&gt; being able to bind is a far more serious detriment than you would have us<br/>
&gt; believe.  Binding is bar-none the most powerful ability in the game,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>period.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is no ability that makes up for it nor any package of abilities that<br/>
&gt; does so balance-wise.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are correct.  That is why that Bards alone cannot get this spell.  It<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be fair for every other class if Bards got &quot;the most powerful<br/>
ability in the game&quot;.  If you would have read my note instead of just trying<br/>
to flame me, you would have saw that.<br/>
<br/>
You can pull a hundred reasons out of your ass as to why Bards should have<br/>
Bind and it won&#39;t make one bit of difference.  Bards are not going to get<br/>
Bind.  Instead of beating your head against a brick wall, you should be<br/>
asking for something that might have a chance of being implemented.  Ask for<br/>
the capability to be bound anywhere (or just at Inns) by a caster AND the<br/>
ability to be bound in cities by NPCs.<br/>

&gt; Oh and the Identify spell isn&#39;t the only spell those pure casters get at<br/>
&gt; that level is it?  In fact it isnt even one of 4 per level group but more<br/>
&gt; like 1 of 8 or ten.  also our 12th level DD does 7 points of damage max.<br/>
&gt; Yeah we can cast it a lot if we don&#39;t cast anything else since none of our<br/>
&gt; spells have the 45+ minute duration of cleric buffs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you just a stupid ass fuck?  I am so sick and tired of all these<br/>
crybabies who has raised up one character to level 12 and thinks their class<br/>
is underpowered.  All your facts are so screwed up.<br/>
<br/>
- &quot;12th level DD does 7 points of damage max&quot;  WRONG.  Every two levels it<br/>
does an extra point of damage.<br/>
- &quot;45+ minute duration of cleric buffs.&quot;  WRONG.  None of the low-medium<br/>
Cleric spells last that long.  Maybe at 40+....<br/>
- &quot;The lousy defensive skills of the caster hybrids&quot;  WRONG.  Bard&#39;s Defense<br/>
caps at 5/level instead of 4/level for Clerics.  Bards have the same<br/>
defensive ability of Rangers and Paladins until level 17-18 (where Rangers<br/>
and Paladins get Parry).<br/>
 - &quot;lousy offensive spells of the melee hybrids.&quot; WRONG.  Paladins can only<br/>
affect Undeads.  And if you stop and restart Bellow, you can get many more<br/>
magical attacks than a Paladin and Ranger could ever hope to get off.  And<br/>
correct me if I am wrong, I thought that the hybrids stop attacking while<br/>
they were casting (or maybe their animation doesn&#39;t show it).  Plus Bards<br/>
never run out of mana.<br/>
- &quot;To call Clerics pure casters is a joke.&quot;  WRONG.  I never called Clerics<br/>
pure casters.<br/>
