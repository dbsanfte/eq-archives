&gt;We have made some changes to the way movement enhancement/reduction works.<br/>
&gt;Essentially, Root and Snare are now completely different spells. This means<br/>
&gt;that Root will suppress snare, but it will not overwrite it. That&#39;s the<br/>
&gt;primary change. But there is also a side effect to this change.<br/>
&gt;Bard songs will no longer break root. Root will also suppress songs that<br/>
&gt;enhance movement.<br/>
&gt;We are aware that this will be seen as a &#39;nerf&#39;. However, I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
&gt;that most of you understood that bard songs were never intended to break<br/>
&gt;root, and this is, in fact, essentially a bug fix.<br/>
&gt;-----------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is pretty bad when I read something like this and think &quot;Great, now our<br/>
&gt;chaining songs are going to be messed up because they forgot to test it on<br/>
&gt;bards&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One thing this does demonstrate is that &quot;movement&quot; type spell effects can be<br/>
&gt;segregated...so why can they move bard song into a class of its own?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I really dont consider this a nerf since Verant has been saying for 2<br/>
&gt;years that bard songs should NOT break root.<br/>

overwrite Snare as well. While it has a &quot;snare&quot; component, it does have a <br/>
much shorter duration. I would think the complication is that if Snare took <br/>
precedence over Consonant Chain, then I would think that Snare would also <br/>
suppress the ATK SPD debuff of Chain as well.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that I doubt they&#39;ve thoroughly tested it. It will be a pleasant <br/>
surprise to see this working &quot;as intended&quot;. We&#39;ll have to double check the <br/>
health levels that mobs stop fleeing at as well with Chains.<br/>
