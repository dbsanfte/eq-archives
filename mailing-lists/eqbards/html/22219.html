<div id="ygrps-yiv-676143451">I agree with you Kit. It&#39;s bad.<br/>
<br/>
Us bards have to press buttons every 5 secs to change songs and now we&#39;ll <br/>
have to continue to be chained to our desks during downtime.<br/>
<br/>
Auto-logoff would be really bad, btw. Have you ever been in a room that has <br/>
a motion sensor light? If you sit at your desk and you&#39;re reading, you have <br/>
to wave your hand in the air every 15 min or end up in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
Auto-logoff is the same thing. You may be sitting reading stuff on your <br/>
screen, not necessarily pushing any buttons for 10 mins, but get booted off <br/>
just because the server thinks you&#39;re inactive. You&#39;d have to make sure you <br/>
push a button every 10 mins or be booted. After you&#39;re booted, you&#39;d lose <br/>
all of your no-rent items as well as any illusions you had up. I don&#39;t <br/>
think Verant would even implement such a bad thing. Uhh, maybe not. Don&#39;t <br/>
post the auto-logoff thing on the web Kit. Please! :-)<br/>

&gt;off?  Plain and simple this is stupid.  It&#39;s another example of where<br/>
&gt;probably some bard was sitting AFK on the planes and now we all have to be<br/>
&gt;nerfed because someone abused the situation.  Heaven forbid they should<br/>
&gt;handle this by putting in an auto logoff when someone is inactive for more<br/>
&gt;than 10 minutes like most games do.<br/>

&gt;Absor has asked everyone to switch to a different thread on this:<br/>

&gt;I&#39;d have to agree with Lago on Verant&#39;s reasoning that this is to keep us<br/>
&gt;from going AFK indefinitely.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I just came across this thread in whineplay, which I think all of you<br/>
&gt;should<br/>
&gt; &gt;take a look at.  Evidently there has been a change to the mechanics of bard<br/>
&gt; &gt;song on Test:<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It appears that this change is to keep us from indefinitely playing a song<br/>
&gt; &gt;while AFK.  The message received is evidently &quot;Your song ends abruptly&quot;,<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;has a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant seems to be<br/>
&gt; &gt;putting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from the keyboard<br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt; &gt;we want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the keyboard to keep<br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt; &gt;song up as well.  I guess bards dont need bathroom breaks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;All this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>
