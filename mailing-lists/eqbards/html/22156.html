<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590152084">It reminds me of Charlie Brown and Lucy every autumn, when she offers to hold the football for him, he<br/>
believes her (yet again), and she yanks it out from under him at the last moment.  I get a feeling of<br/>
ironic sadness when I read the comic strip.  When it happens to me in RL, I just get ticked.  I&#39;m not<br/>
going to believe a thing until I see it.  They&#39;ve yanked the football from me too many times now.<br/>

&gt; Rokenn and I would both bet against it and will be<br/>
