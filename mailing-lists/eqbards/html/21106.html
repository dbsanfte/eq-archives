Two of my coworkers were corrupted by their wives!  They used to snicker at<br/>
those of us who played, until their spouses talked them into trying it.  Now<br/>
they&#39;re the ones who hooked.<br/>

what .. you mean you have friends out of eq??? <br/>
<br/>
/giggle<br/>
<br/>
5 of my RL friends corrupted my husband, who in turn<br/>
corrupted me and we in turn corrupted 2 more couples. <br/>
Now with duplicate accounts and all, between myself<br/>
and RL friends there are 12 accounts.  <br/>
<br/>
And yes, i do still have a life outside of eq. I only<br/>
play when the kids are asleep or at school.  That<br/>
would explain why over a year after creation Harmonie<br/>
is lvl 32.  (This time last year i was 8th lvl.. so i<br/>
am making progress).<br/>
