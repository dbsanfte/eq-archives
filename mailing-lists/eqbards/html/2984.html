GuardiansoftheVale, you don&#39;t actually have to kill anything<br/>
in Misty Thicket.  Just find goblins and orcs that other<br/>
people are fighting, whack it once with your sword (or throw a<br/>
throwing knife at it under the pretense that you&#39;re<br/>
practicing), and move on.  When the person finishes off the<br/>
mob, you will get a faction adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing to watch out for is that if the person ends up<br/>
being killed by the mob, it will come searching for you next.<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t be a problem for a bard as the deputies there are<br/>
very effective (too effective at times).<br/>
