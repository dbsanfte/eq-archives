<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136751758">Maybe what should happen when you&#39;re very drunk is you get messages saying<br/>
your songs are a LOT more effective, when in reality they&#39;re doing less<br/>
damage/effect.  Heheh.<br/>
<br/>
Course, bards really should be more effective after a few, but after 12?  At<br/>
that point the bard should just be misled into thinking they&#39;re doing<br/>
better, while the rest of the party just sighs and looks over at the<br/>
shambling mound that was once a bard.<br/>

&gt;    In a Bards case, alcohol tolerance, IMHO should actually INCREASE the<br/>
&gt;effects of our songs. For instance, when I was playing in a band I played<br/>
&gt;100 times better when I was completely hammered. In the sense Verant is<br/>
&gt;using it, being drunk seems to enhance a characters specialty (ie. Warriors<br/>
&gt;fight better and main stats increase), so why shouldn&#39;t Bards become more<br/>
&gt;rambunctious and charismatic?<br/>
