<div id="ygrps-yiv-286936570">Here is my take on Stacking Songs.<br/>
 The songs that your bard is singing and stacking  are not the songs that he<br/>
is singing in the Taverns.  He&#39;s not sitting down by the fire and<br/>
entertaining the patrons with Chant of Battle or worse yet Chords of<br/>
Dissonance.  Those are songs that have special qualities to enable him to<br/>
survive the trip to his next gig.  The songs that he sings in the inns would<br/>
be songs he learned before he was given his Bards Guild Membership.  The<br/>
songs you have to buy are magical and are sung for the magical effect, not<br/>
for the entertainment value to the listeners, so when you have achieved the<br/>
desired effect you proceed to another magical verse for another effect.</div>
