<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863052996">True but the problem is stuff like this is still going to happen so there is<br/>
need to punish other people who kite properly. The majority of the people<br/>
kite properly and that&#39;s the thing. Very few people ,at least on my server,<br/>
don&#39;t kite properly, and those that do it wrong are usually the ones that<br/>
train people for the fun of it.<br/>

&gt;I imagine from your post that you are a responsible kiter.  Have you ever<br/>
&gt;kited a SG up and down the coast in Oasis?  If not then you are probably<br/>
&gt;doing things right.  I myself have died to irresponsible kiters numerous<br/>
&gt;times.  What occurs is the fact that the kiter with JBoots or SOW starts<br/>
&gt;to outrun the MOB.  The mob still continues to chase you but it will mob<br/>
&gt;anything near it.  Trust me I know, I have died to it while looting a dead<br/>
&gt;mob, looting my corpse, while a druid ran by me and even while medding in<br/>
&gt;the desert.  Now was this druid kiting?  Of course she was because she was<br/>
&gt;having a discussion with some other druids and necros about kiting the<br/>
&gt;giants in Oasis.  Let me say that kiting is not bad when done properly,<br/>
&gt;when done wrong it it is downright detestable and those people should<br/>
&gt;suffer.<br/>
