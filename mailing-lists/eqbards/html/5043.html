If a piece of plate has an AC of say 5<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely not.  AC determines how much damage you take from each hit.  AGI<br/>
is directly relative to your AC (higher AGI at higher levels = more base<br/>
AC); it also determines how often you are &quot;missed&quot;, how often you block,<br/>
parry, dodge, riposte, etc.  To my knowledge, there are no armors that have<br/>
a &quot;Rune I or II&quot; effect on them.  The Rune spells are a series for<br/>
Enchanters and some other classes that lets your armor absorb damage.  This<br/>
gives the message &quot;Ambassador DVinn tries to hit soandso, but his magical<br/>
skin absorbs the blow!&quot;.  Quite useful for magi trying to kill stuff while<br/>
getting pounded.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, if you have a full set of leather armor, or a full set of mesh<br/>
armor (both have same AC, but mesh is rediculously lighter and more<br/>
expensive :), you will be taking the same amount of damage from each hit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The type of armor does make a difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The difference between leather and plate<br/>
&gt; &gt; was like night and day, and in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinion still is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But is it different because of the AC # difference, or because of the<br/>
&gt; material the armor is made from? ie: If a piece of plate has an AC of say<br/>
5<br/>
&gt; and a piece of Mesh had an AC of 5 as well, would there be a difference?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The question is whether the AC# makes the difference or the material makes<br/>
&gt; the difference.<br/>
