<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-565217913">Actually I found this to be one of the more satisfying and logical quests<br/>
out there in the early days.  Compared to the rusty weapons most quests gave<br/>
you back then the Squad Ring was awesome.  It was quite a badge of honor<br/>
back then since you had to devote a lot of time to keeping Rivervale free of<br/>
goblins and orcs to get one.  The 100pt heal may not sound like much to us<br/>
now, but I was only 9th level when I got it and it definitely saved my life<br/>
more than a dozen times back then.  It also allowed me to help others in<br/>
trouble who were not in my group for the first time.<br/>

value of related faction hits.  That being said, it should be noted that <br/>
Mooto DOES give a significantly higher faction increase - but this is <br/>
intentional - not a function of math ;)<br/>
