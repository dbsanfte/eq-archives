This was the second time he entered the zone after dying.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know why, but when you run into the inconsistent corpse<br/>
location bug, entering the zone the 2nd time (i.e. &quot;re-enter<br/>
the zone&quot;) seems to clear it up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; corpse was moved to a reachable location.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     So again - perhaps things have changed - but if you do find yourself in<br/>
&gt; this dilemma - a quick log-out and log-in is worth a try - it doesn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; cost you anything...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or you can zone out and zone back in.<br/>
<br/>
The question I have is did *you* also zone out and come back,<br/>
and when did the corpse appear in a new location for you?<br/>
Every time I&#39;ve run across this bug, I&#39;ve been the one to<br/>
re-zone first, and thus I end up seeing the corpse while the<br/>
others don&#39;t (and it&#39;s always been their corpse, not mine).  <br/>
I don&#39;t know if it works the other way.<br/>
