<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916967049">Well, I don&#39;t know the difference between disco and disco 2, but I spent all Sunday camped in the room where<br/>
the scarab spawns (to the side of the room where the grup spawns) and I have no idea how anyone could think<br/>
that a Bard would be sufficient (without a level 60 puller, as Jeffrey wrote).  I&#39;d repeated that based on<br/>
comments I&#39;d received in game.  We would have been dead/evaced at least four times.  Thank goodness for level<br/>
57 Enchanters.<br/>

&gt; you&#39;ve also got a necro or a pally/cleric who is good at rooting stuff away from the fight.  in the<br/>
&gt; &#39;&#39;library&#39;&#39; (what a cool looking room btw) we had a couple fights where we ended up killing 6 in<br/>
&gt; the same fight, but we also had some where we were able to kill 2, then 1 more, then a couple<br/>
&gt; roamers in separate fights.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If a bard could even keep 3 mezzed it would at least make grouping at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;50+ a bit more fun than having to sit around until an enchanter logged<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;on to go to Sebilis or HS. Once you pass 55 even pickup groups in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Karnors stop being an option as the front mobs turn mostly green.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i&#39;ve been getting pickup groups in sebilis at 53.  we&#39;ve done guardian, zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in and zone out without enchanters.  i think the jail is also doable without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; an enchanter but the only time i was there, we happened to have one.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve done the jail (&quot;4 necros&quot; on my server) without an Enchanter.  You really shouldn&#39;t get more than 3<br/>
&gt; &gt;things at once, and once you break the spawns up, it&#39;s easy.  Disco is supposed to be doable also.<br/>
