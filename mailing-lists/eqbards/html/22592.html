<div id="ygrps-yiv-446749642">the faction hate list is huge now, no longer only a max of 6 people, so if<br/>
you fight in VP and survive any fights you will get a hit and you will no<br/>
longer be non-KOS to the outdoor dragons or the VP dragons =/  i was warmly<br/>
when i went in, haven&#39;t conned anything since but i think i only survived 1<br/>
or 2 fights at the most.  i may be non-KOS til next trip.<br/>

&gt; in VP some <br/>
&gt; friends of mine decided to duel (don&#39;t EVER do this in VP), <br/>
&gt; and Hoshkar, who <br/>
&gt; is kindly to me, stand right on top of me and kill them. His <br/>
&gt; AE hit me HARD, <br/>
&gt; but he walked away after my friends died w/out aggroing me. *shrug*<br/>
