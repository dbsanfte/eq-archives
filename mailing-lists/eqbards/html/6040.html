<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665612422">Heh, there is a level difference skewing this discussion. No, warriors can&#39;t<br/>
taunt anything, at level 17 a warrior with maxed taunt couldn&#39;t get anything<br/>
off me. I haven&#39;t grouped with another of my same level since. Maybe at<br/>
higher levels it works better.<br/>

&gt;mix.  The monster stays on me for 3 or 4 round, and then the<br/>
&gt;warrior has taunted enough to pull it off me.<br/>

The landscape obviously changes over the course of the lifetime of a bard.<br/>
