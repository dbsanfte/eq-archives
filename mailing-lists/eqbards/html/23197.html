<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930639267">Nah, the only thing they get stuck on is their own poor pathing.  No<br/>
physical piece of geometry stops them from continuing in a straight line,<br/>
but the pathing ends there so they turn and try to retrace their steps.<br/>
Most likely it is a broken &#39;T&#39; on the end of a normal path and that is where<br/>
they stay since fleeing mobs only turn on a path if they have to.  The same<br/>
thing happens just in front of one of the Tizmak caves in GD.  The Tizmac<br/>
will sometimes get on that path and then walk back and forth along a 4or 5<br/>
step range till it dies.<br/>

be an exploit too.<br/>
