&gt;What is the source of this answer? I believe the reason there is no icon<br/>
&gt;is to allow the song to stack with the song of another bard. Testing<br/>
&gt;conducted by many Bards&Caster pairs clearly indicates this song has a<br/>
&gt;3-pulse duration.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Clarity)?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A: There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an <br/>
&gt;icon<br/>
&gt; &gt; on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>
&gt; &gt; seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt; &gt; means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; song effect going indefinitely.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it<br/>
&gt; &gt; does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your <br/>
&gt;screen.<br/>
