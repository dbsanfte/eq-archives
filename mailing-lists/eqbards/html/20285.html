What system are you using?  If you&#39;re having problems in Blackburrow you<br/>
really need to consider upgrading your system.  The lag there should be<br/>
minimal, if any.  If you&#39;re having that kind of problem in Blackburrow I<br/>
dread to think how bad kunark is going to be for you :(  Might want to<br/>
consider picking up a TNT 2 Ultra with 32mb ram.  You can get them for a<br/>
song these days (around $70-$150) and maybe some more ram for your computer<br/>
(128mb ram is great for EQ)<br/>
<br/>
Just some helpful hints.  If you&#39;re having that much trouble with BB I&#39;d<br/>
suspect your system is kind of lower-end.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful.<br/>
