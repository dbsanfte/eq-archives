<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661823158">I was running through SK last night and paid a visit to our old friend<br/>
Vhalen.  He was actually pretty chatty, singing me a ballad and then telling<br/>
me the story behind it.  He spoke of an old flame of his (her name was<br/>
Matala, I think -- notes are at home) and how she had dumped him for someone<br/>
else and was now up to some nefarious purposes.  I got through the story and<br/>
tried to get him to say more, but some idiot and his pet chose that moment<br/>
to whack the poor bard, so I can&#39;t be sure that I got everything from him.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of each section of text, Vhalen would ask if I wanted him to go<br/>
on, but there were no brackets on anything.  Typing in what you would expect<br/>
to type in kept him going, however (e.g. &quot;I would like to hear more&quot;).<br/>
Unfortunately, he never indicates any sort of action you should take, he<br/>
just says that Matala (if I remember her name correctly) must be stopped.<br/>
Anyone else spoken to him lately?  Is this an old quest that I am just now<br/>
discovering?  I&#39;d appreciate any guidance.<br/>
