<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652628939">I have in fact encountered the named SG Hatar in Oasis.<br/>
I was doing some safe but pretty boring croc hunting near the docks with a <br/>
friend,<br/>
when we saw an SG stoll by. Look a named SG, and he cons yellow! Lets get <br/>
him! If i remember correctly I was lvl 18 at the time.<br/>
So we jump him and soon discovers that he is one tough yellow, hitting for <br/>
some 50 a punch, but none of the 120 point hits other SGs has scored <br/>
(without killing though, I must add :). Oh well, we sound the retreat and <br/>
bolt for the zone.<br/>
Back again in the zone we quickly gather three more ppl to join us<br/>
for that rare SG hunting expedition at this lvl.<br/>
We soon find him in the desert near N Ro and promptly charged.<br/>
Again a tough battle began with Hatar swinging left and right. After a short <br/>
while most group members are down to half health, but so is Hatar and we <br/>
feel that we are winning, when suddenly BOOM and Hatar falls dead to the <br/>
ground. Cheers break out but I think wtf no exp!<br/>
I look around and, oh yes, there he is the high lvl KS nuker standing at <br/>
safe distance.<br/>
Oh well I think, hadnt had a chance to loot anyway in the right click frenzy <br/>
thats sure to take place in this quickly assembled group.<br/>
And now I can claim that I have stood my ground against an SG and lived to <br/>
tell the tale!<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m lucky enough to meet him again I will certainly give it a second try.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and greetings to you all! This is my first post to this excellent list <br/>
which I have enjoyed for a while now.<br/>

&gt;Hatar does spawn in Oasis.  I&#39;ve spent many, many hours in oasis as my monk<br/>
&gt;and as my bard and I have never seen Hatar.  I always look at them to see, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;click on the ones too far away to have text over them...  Never seen him.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;would imagine that it&#39;s considerably easier/cheaper to get/buy an<br/>
&gt;executioner&#39;s hood.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, cool.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I really appreciate all of your comments about my unfortunate human <br/>
&gt;banded<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; helm situation.  I think that I will probably try to obtain a Turban <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Sand Giant.  I looked it up and the turban gives +10 to AC with <br/>
&gt;almost<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; no weight.  Does anyone know how much they generally sell for, so I <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; start saving my plats... or gather sympathetic party to hunt with me?  <br/>
&gt;:)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hatar is a spawn so rare, I, and most people I know, have never seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; him. He spawns in either Oasis or S Ro (so I&#39;ve heard) and I used to<br/>
&gt; &gt; check tracking every time I passed through there. I even auctioned that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would pay 100 plat for a tell from someone when he was sighted and<br/>
&gt; &gt; never once got a message. I lucked out and got one from someone who did<br/>
&gt; &gt; stumble across him, and I traded a serpantine bracer for it. I&#39;ve only<br/>
&gt; &gt; run across 3 of them on Tarrew Marr, counting the one I have.<br/>
