prices are 5% higher than whatever internal base price they<br/>
are using.  My best selling prices used to be 5% lower than<br/>
the base price, but that got changed in a patch sever weeks<br/>
ago and now it seems to be my best selling price plus 5%<br/>
equals the base price.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cool.  I&#39;d suspected the effect of Carillon was capped, but<br/>
it&#39;s tough for me to test it since I almost always get the<br/>
best prices regardless of what I do.  :-)<br/>

&gt; find is my religion over other wood elf bards I&#39;ve talked to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What diety did you pick?  Pixies were apprehensive to me too<br/>
(Erollisi).  I&#39;m curious if there are any negatives to being<br/>
agnostic, since they seem to not be KOS in many places others<br/>
are.<br/>
