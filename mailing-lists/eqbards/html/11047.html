research the ice comet spell (49th lvl).<br/>
What went wrong?  Could be several things. A wandering goblin you didn&#39;t see<br/>
got nodded and while nodded a train ran by him.  The train having killed its<br/>
prey went to the only thing left on its agro list, you the bard that nodded<br/>
its friend on the other side of the zone.  That&#39;s most likely given the High<br/>
Priest and the Preacher ae found on different sides of the zone.  Also<br/>
Lullaby is broken.  Many times it will not be resisted yet the mob will<br/>
suffer no ill effects of being nodded.  This has happened to me recently on<br/>
a fleeing mob.  I saw it nod, so didn&#39;t continue to chase it and didn&#39;t<br/>
notice it still ran away to get it&#39;s brethren while supposedly nodded until<br/>
it was too late.<br/>
