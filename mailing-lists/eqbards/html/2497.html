<div id="ygrps-yiv-718181065">Well you&#39;ve thought this out a whole lot more than I have hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would suggest that J.M. knows the answer, but I would bet my<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s life that he isn&#39;t going to post a formula.  Firstly he<br/>
&gt; likely wouldn&#39;t want to, and secondly it may be against a<br/>
&gt; confidentiality clause in his contract.  ;)<br/>
&gt; Besides, it would ruin all the fun we have of throwing ideas<br/>
&gt; back and forth. ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I thought the same thing, but you never know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You haven&#39;t stated your &#39;skill lvl/strength bonuses&#39;.  Personally<br/>
&gt; I HATE magic numbers (I&#39;m a programmer), so throwing in a &#39;9&#39; is<br/>
&gt; unsatisfactory without explanation, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, seems too simple doesnt it. The thing is, back in my newbie days, I could<br/>
hit for 17 with a mino axe. So I just assumed the formula was, as I stated<br/>
earlier,weapon dmg * 2 + strength/skill bonuses. And with the mino axe it&#39;d be<br/>
8 * 2 + 1 (It&#39;d make sense that my strength/skill bonus would only amount to<br/>
1, since I was a newbie afterall). This formula seemed to remain true through<br/>
out my character&#39;s life as I went from weapon to weapon. Combine LS, barbed<br/>
whips, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Obviously.  Firstly you didn&#39;t say what skill that weapon used,<br/>
&gt; so i can&#39;t check my own formula.  But assuming it is a 1H or<br/>
&gt; piercing weapon, my formula gives max damage of 34.  Pretty close,<br/>
&gt; if not correct.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, a 1h weapon. I am a bard afterall =) Also, last night I peaked at 36 dmg<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, I have a problem with a dmg * (something) + something else.<br/>
&gt; Personally the idea of dmg * (something + something else) is more<br/>
&gt; appealing to me, as it gives greater return as &#39;something&#39; and<br/>
&gt; &#39;something else&#39; (say STR and skill) increase.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whatever you say =) You seem to have a better understanding of mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The inconsistent results you recieved also suggest that whatever<br/>
&gt; formula you used to get your magic number &#39;9&#39; is wrong.  Did you<br/>
&gt; actually use a formula, or did you just say &quot;dmg * 2 - max = 9,<br/>
&gt; so the modifier must be + 9&quot;?<br/>
&gt; The fact that it doesn&#39;t work suggests that the modifier is not<br/>
&gt; just a linear addend.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well as I said before, about my Mino axe days. The dmg * 2 + variable seemed<br/>
to work.As I progressed through levels, it has always been dmg * 2 + 1, dmg *<br/>
2 + 2,<br/>
dmg * 2 + 3, +4, +5, +6 etc etc, up until now where its at +9... until I used<br/>
this new weapon that seems to break the rules. (Which I dont mind, hehe)<br/>
<br/>
Another theory: I&#39;ve never used a weapon before that had a greater base dmg<br/>
than 8 (yea, the mino axe). Perhaps there&#39;s a different formula for different<br/>
dmg weapons. Like 2h weapons seem to have totally different rules. My ranger<br/>
friend can hit for 61 with a 2h black iron bastard sword, which has a base dmg<br/>
of 20. So what I&#39;m getting at, is maybe there&#39;s a different formula for<br/>
weapons that have a greater base damage than say... 10.<br/>
And a different formula for those greater than say 15. Regardless if the<br/>
weapon is 1h or 2h.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As posted earlier by myself, i believe the formula is something like:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; dmg * max( (skill in weapon + STR)/100 , 2) + 1<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, what is the &quot;max&quot; you refer to?<br/>
<br/>
Also, ever take a look at the ATK? Maybe you can figure out a way that it fits<br/>
into a formula, since the ATK number adds up offense skill, weapon skill (the<br/>
weapon in your primary hand) and strength. Perhaps maximum dmg is related<br/>
directly to your ATK? Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>
