&gt;You probably all have comparable computers/connections/whatever.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m always<br/>
&gt;falling behind in my groups.  Fortunately we&#39;re usually using my song, so<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re all forced to slow down & wait.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Glad to hear /follow has been fixed.  I petitioned about that almost a year<br/>
&gt;ago I think.  Anyone tried it? </span></blockquote></div>
