<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055046456">Sigh.  Every time I hear something like this it reminds me how little<br/>
support you get from Verant.  I have an A3d card which Verant claims is<br/>
supported.  However, I do not hear the sounds mobs make outside of combat.<br/>
That&#39;s right, no howling wolves, no chittering beetles, and more importantly<br/>
no stomping giants.  Every giant in the game can sneak right up on me and<br/>
pound away to his heart&#39;s content.  It was 3 months before I even knew I<br/>
wasn&#39;t hearing these sounds till a friend started complaining about all the<br/>
druids running around howling.  He came over and listened to my system and<br/>
was shocked.  Needless to say Verant&#39;s support was terrible.  They had three<br/>
suggestions.  Get the latest drivers.  Done no change.  Turn down Hardware<br/>
Acceleration.  Done, no change.  Get an SBLive card.  ???  They say the card<br/>
I have is not only supported, but tested to work as well?  Anybody else have<br/>
these problems?  Another guildmate of mine has a different A3d card and it<br/>
works fine.  His is from a secondary manufacturer and mine is from A3d.<br/>
You&#39;d think he would be the one with the problem?<br/>

I have a SBLive and haven&#39;t run into any problems yet (knock on wood).  To<br/>
be on the safe side, yesterday I downloaded the most recent drivers from the<br/>
Creative website and installed them.  I was shocked when I logged in.  Prior<br/>
to installing the updated drivers, the sound in EQ was pretty good.  After<br/>
installing the new drivers, it got even better.  The Environmental Audio<br/>
support improved dramatically.  I started hearing sound effects that I<br/>
didn&#39;t even know were in the game.  The most recent SBLive driver is from<br/>
Nov 99 so if you don&#39;t have it download it and give it a try.<br/>
