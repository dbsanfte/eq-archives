&gt; In my experience, bard hate has nothing to do with faction.  Here&#39;s what<br/>
&gt; happens.  Puller grabs a MOB, usually by whacking on it, or shooting it with<br/>
&gt; an arrow/spell.  This MOB is then very angry at puller for having done<br/>
&gt; damage to it - great! exactly what we want.  Everyone then assists the<br/>
&gt; puller and continues to whack on this MOB, keeping its attention mainly off<br/>
&gt; the bard.  <br/>
<br/>

fighting a mob (not one of the ones they are ignoring) and it stops part<br/>
way through the fight to run over and take a whack at the bard in<br/>
another group. I&#39;ve seen this in both Unrest and Cazic.<br/>
