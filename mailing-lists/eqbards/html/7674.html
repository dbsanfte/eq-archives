They can were armor.  An item a pure caster cannot wear.  That in itself<br/>
makes them a hybrid.  Heres a simplistic example:<br/>
<br/>
Black = Caster<br/>
White = Melee<br/>
Grey  = Hybrid<br/>
<br/>
A hybrid shares some of each types characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
Wizard cant wear Plate but can cast spells = Black<br/>
Melee Can wear Plate but cant cast spells  = White<br/>
Hybrid can wear plate or equivalent and can cast some spells = Grey<br/>
<br/>
Classes = Grey<br/>
	    Ranger<br/>
	    Shaman<br/>
	    Cleric<br/>
	    Druid<br/>
	    Bard<br/>
	    Paladin<br/>
	    ShadowKnight<br/>
<br/>
How can this logic be refuted when looked at in this light?<br/>
------------<br/>
That&#39;s just it, the armour issue isn&#39;t the &quot;right&quot; light to look at it in.  It<br/>
isn&#39;t a matter of equipment usage, but rather class composition and more<br/>
abstractly, class concept.  As far as Verant is concerned (and they are the<br/>
people making the decisions now, aren&#39;t they?) there are three primary<br/>
&quot;meta-classes,&quot; the Fighter, the Magic-User, the Priest and a secondary<br/>
&quot;meta-class&quot; of hybrid.  <br/>
Fighters are the warriors, rogues, and monks.  No spells, varying degrees of<br/>
armour (Monks get no better armour than Magic-users, if you&#39;d like to factor<br/>
that into your armour equation) and varying weapon choices.  Their skills, in<br/>
combat at least, are concentrated on pure melee (though Rogues have a number<br/>
of non combat skills).  <br/>
Magic-users (and this term is meant more as a handy name handed down from old<br/>
pencil and paper RPG&#39;s than to mean &quot;all users of magic&quot;) are the<br/>
necromancers, mages, wizards and enchanters.  Their skills are concentrated on<br/>
spell casting, and offensive spells at that, though they do get a generous<br/>
portion of utility spells, and defensive buffs as well (I&#39;ve never had it cast<br/>
on me, but the Rune series just sounds like fun).   Conceptually, the<br/>
Magic-user is a robed caster (which I imagine is where a large portion of your<br/>
armour theory comes from), leaning on a staff, casting spells from afar, and<br/>
immolating his opponents with huge fireballs.  <br/>
Priests, the category in contention here, are primarily defined by their<br/>
decendance from the D&D Cleric and Druid classes.  Their spell selection is<br/>
concentrated on healing and defensive spells (though they do have smite, etc).<br/>
 As far as weapon and armour selection, those are both directly inherited from<br/>
D&D.  The shaman is a bit of a sticky matter, as it is probably arguable that<br/>
they are a hybrid of the Cleric and Druid classes or the Druid and Enchanter<br/>
(I don&#39;t agree with this, but I see how the argument could be made).  However<br/>
as Verant has made many references to the &quot;Seven primary spell casting<br/>
classes&quot; I assume that it is meant to be one of the primary classes, and with<br/>
it&#39;s concentration on healing spells and odd armour/weapon selection, they<br/>
seem to quite clearly fit into the Priest meta-class.<br/>
Hybrids are classes which are a combination of 2 other classes (way back when,<br/>
these would have been called &quot;dual-classed characters&quot;).  Paladins are<br/>
Warrior/Clerics, Rangers are Warrior/Druids, and Shadowknights are<br/>
Warrior/Necromancers.  (I&#39;ve always thought that a Rogue/Enchanter class would<br/>
be interesting, though in many ways, that&#39;s what we are... though not<br/>
completely.)<br/>
Bards are odd.  We don&#39;t fit nicely into any of those categories.  In some<br/>
ways, we are the &quot;meta-meta&quot; class.  (There&#39;s an argument for us to have every<br/>
skill.)  &quot;Jack-of-all-trades&quot; aside, we really can perform just about any <br/>
function in the game.  We can fight (though there tends to be some argument<br/>
over how well), we can burn, we can control crowds, we can heal, we can buff,<br/>
and we can travel.  While Verant considers us to be hybrids (perhaps on the<br/>
argument that we are the ultimate hybrid), we don&#39;t really fit in that<br/>
category, as none of our abilities can be directly traced back to a pair (or<br/>
more) of &quot;character class parents.&quot;<br/>
As to the original discussion (which admittedly, has been lost a bit in all of<br/>
this), the main reason we don&#39;t get bind isn&#39;t because we are hybrids, it is<br/>
because we aren&#39;t one of Verant&#39;s &quot;seven primary spell casting classes,&quot; i.e.<br/>
Mage, Necromancer, Wizard, Enchanter, Druid, Cleric or Shaman.  (Though oddly,<br/>
when references to the seven &quot;caster-classes&quot; are made, it is usually in a<br/>
discussion of how Verant has tried to make each of them unique.  I suppose we<br/>
aren&#39;t considered in that discussion because we are already &quot;unique enough.&quot;)<br/>
I can go on and on (I&#39;ve already edited out a few paragraphs on Everquest&#39;s<br/>
descendance from Circle/Diku Muds, and the grand daddy of them all, Dungeons<br/>
and Dragons.  By the by, if anyone reading this used to play on ENSImud,<br/>
*LICKS!*)<br/>
