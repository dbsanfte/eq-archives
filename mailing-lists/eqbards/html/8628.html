<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701588272">if you are in the bedroom, there are two halls next to each other leading<br/>
out.  the one on the right is the spider hall and if you keep following it<br/>
around will run into the gargs.  i think hehe, have to get home and see.<br/>
there are also gargs near the bridge leading to the tower.  if you head to<br/>
the right towards the live side instead of the tower, there are gargs there<br/>
though i don&#39;t know if any will spawn as basalts.  i am guessing level is<br/>
around 35.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone out there know where the basalt gargoyles can be <br/>
&gt; found in Lower<br/>
&gt; Guk and their approximate level?  If so, would you be willing <br/>
&gt; to share? :-)<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
