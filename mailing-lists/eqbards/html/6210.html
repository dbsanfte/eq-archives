Brad was playing the game and got upset that some high level<br/>
characters were harvesting low level mobs for the equipment.<br/>
Apparently he doesn&#39;t mind harvesting, but he does mind if you<br/>
do it without taking any risk (i.e. killing easy green stuff).<br/>

And yes, I&#39;m as baffled as you are as to why they haven&#39;t done<br/>
