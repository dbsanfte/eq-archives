<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866639607">I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve already &quot;trashed&quot; the previous mails, but no, I responded to<br/>
Naeeldar&#39;s email (or at least I thought I did, I had zero sleep last night<br/>
and sadly, it was because of work, not Everquest) that this is specific to<br/>
bard&#39;s singing.<br/>
<br/>
But I thought there was a message that came out shortly after my initial<br/>
reply that they said they proc&#39;d fine. Was that the Ogre bouncer person or<br/>
something? Ah well. Sorry, I don&#39;t remember, but I&#39;m with you! I think<br/>
there&#39;s a problem with it. I&#39;ll get more time to play around with it<br/>
tomorrow.<br/>

&gt; If you were referring to the previous post by Naeeldar about <br/>
&gt; procs still<br/>
&gt; working as expected then it doesn&#39;t apply.  He was referrring <br/>
&gt; to procs with<br/>
&gt; his necro and not his bard.  I think every bard who has <br/>
&gt; posted has noticed a<br/>
&gt; decrease in procs after the patch.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It was suggested that our songs may be preventing items <br/>
&gt; from procing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; we&#39;ve receive a report to the contrary of that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve actually noticed a increase. I was dueling a warrior on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my necro for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the heck of it and in duels procs are a lot more rare we&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her obstenate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; claymore proced like mado n me and my pet heh was interesting.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m not too concerned yet, but did anyone else playing last <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; night notice a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;staggering drop in the number of procs that their weapons <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are firing? <br/>
