<div id="ygrps-yiv-740945132">I have the mistmoor drums. I got them off  a castle train when I was about<br/>
32. My group was at the zone when we heard &quot;TRAIN! CHOO CHOO A COMING<br/>
THROUGH&quot; We saw every imaginable creature at the zone..heh  I was charmed<br/>
almost immediately and got to watch my friends slice me to bits (grin). Well<br/>
they droppped me, they dropped the named gypsy..and they looted and ran.<br/>
When I got back they presented me with my very own battledrums. Do I<br/>
recommed going after her before your 40?..NO..but if you do..PLEASE  use as<br/>
much magic resist as possible to save yourself from being charmed! Since mm<br/>
castle trains (at least on MY server) are an ever occuring thing, one can<br/>
concievabley camp the zone for the gypsy. Harmonic..I know what your<br/>
thinking..NO I won&#39;t help you get them :) The offer for sol A still stands<br/>
though  :)<br/>

--&gt;I have been told that a named gypsy NPC drops the battle drum.  Don&#39;t<br/>
have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;one myself but looking forward to it.  I have only been in Mistmoore 3-4<br/>
&gt;times but on two of those occasions someone was auctioning the battle drum<br/>
&gt;for 500PP.<br/>
&gt;BTW, one time someone pulled a train of the gypsies to the zone.  There<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;two regular gypsies and the named gypsy.  I had just zoned in.  There were<br/>
&gt;about 10 other players at the zone trying to fight them.  People started<br/>
&gt;dropping like flies<br/>
&gt; That leads me to believe you need a group of 30+ players to<br/>
&gt;survive against the gypsies.<br/>
