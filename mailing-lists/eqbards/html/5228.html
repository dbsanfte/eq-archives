<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596951642"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Heck, I&#39;ve even had something cast at me through the walls<br/>
&gt; while I was in Lesser Faydark standing right next to the<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore zone.  I know this is supposed to be impossible, and<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t have believed it if it hadn&#39;t happened to me.<br/>
&gt; Something with a Mistmoore-ish name behind the walls tagged me<br/>
&gt; with tashan and a DD.  I moved away from the zone and it<br/>
&gt; stopped casting at me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eh, I find this really really hard to believe, seeing as the mobs simply<br/>
don&#39;t exist in that zone. If you could go past the zone border, you&#39;d find<br/>
a dead end (I have friends who have done this when running from a train<br/>
and died -- bug). Also, if these mobs did exist, surely we&#39;d hear them<br/>
buff themselves. Additionally, they&#39;d showup on track.<br/>
<br/>
More likely is that some of the fae drakes got stuck in the path to the<br/>
mistmoore zone. Several of them are enchanters/wizards and can even charm.<br/>
There&#39;s a whole mass of them right at the start of the path and I<br/>
frequently see them along the path.<br/>
