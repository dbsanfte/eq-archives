<div id="ygrps-yiv-324960858">Whoops, one slight correction on my first email. My sliding works fine <br/>
using the &lt;ctrl&gt; key (shift key isn&#39;t used for that function)<br/>
<br/>
However, when I go to switch my hotkeys with shift-1 or something, <br/>
sometimes I hold my shift key down while doing a movement command, which <br/>
then locks me into my last command.<br/>
<br/>
Definite bug as this didn&#39;t happen before.<br/>

&gt;Originally i found that occaisonally my shift key would appear to get stuck<br/>
&gt;and would stick other keys as well. Upon further investigation I linked this<br/>
&gt;to the numluck key being lit up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To replicate, make sure numlock is lit. Hit 6 on the numpad to turn right,<br/>
&gt;then hit shift, then lift up the 6 key before lifting up shift and watch<br/>
&gt;yourself spin ad infinitum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For months this was extremely annoying, but controlable through careful<br/>
&gt;monitoring of the numlock light. Then a few patches ago, things<br/>
&gt;deteriorated. Now, shift in conjunction with other keys has a chance to lock<br/>
&gt;that key. I&#39;ve seen my back space key locked, my shift key locked and<br/>
&gt;movement keys locked. Fortunately, the temporary fix is easy, just hit shift<br/>
&gt;again and it will unlock the key. In terms of a more permanent fix, I<br/>
&gt;suggest reverting to win 98 or win 95. I have been unable to replicate this<br/>
&gt;on either of those OSes and everyone I&#39;ve spoken with that has the bug is on<br/>
&gt;win 2k.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Sliding problems<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had big problems last night with my movement keys. I use a lot of &quot;slide<br/>
&gt;left&quot; and &quot;slide right&quot; movement in battle (old Doom/Quake habit). However,<br/>
&gt;I noticed now that when I press the &quot;shift&quot; key to slide, it locks me in<br/>
&gt;the same direction of movement (if I were turning then I start spinning).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I sent a bug report in last night, and even submitted a petition. Was<br/>
&gt;surprised a guide contacted me (since I said that this was a low priority<br/>
&gt;in the grand scheme of things) and he told me to try to press my right<br/>
&gt;mouse button to slide. I tried this, even though I usually use my right<br/>
&gt;hand for the movement keys, but it didn&#39;t work. He didn&#39;t have any idea<br/>
&gt;what I could try to fix, since I mentioned I even tried remapping the<br/>
&gt;history commands to different keys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He suggested I wipe my opt files, but I just did that last week, so<br/>
&gt;everything is pretty clean. So I submitted a bug.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone else had similar problems and if so, anyone figure a way to fix<br/>
&gt;it?<br/>
