<div id="ygrps-yiv-389997550">I had just posted the following fairly recently. Gives you a decent idea of <br/>
where to go for solo charming. I&#39;m the last person to give advice about <br/>
equipment, so I&#39;ll leave it to those people.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just to help alleviate the fears of any young bards that &quot;charm kiting&quot; is<br/>
&gt;dead or too difficult, I just wanted to say that I think it&#39;s still alive<br/>
&gt;and well. I&#39;m a very experienced charm-kiter and have gotten to level 50<br/>
&gt;(yay!) primarily as a solo kiting bard due to my real life commitments, but<br/>
&gt;as I&#39;ve mentioned previously, with some practice anyone can get good at<br/>
&gt;this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve recently been emptying the giant fort in the Eastern Wastes with a mix<br/>
&gt;of charm kiting and chant kiting whenever I pass by. Anyway, it&#39;s just the<br/>
&gt;same ol, same ol. Charm one and restart selo&#39;s, press my &quot;target nearest<br/>
&gt;npc&quot; key, press my &quot;/pet attack&quot; social, retarget my pet and wait for charm<br/>
&gt;to break. Once it does break, I repeat the process over and over and over.<br/>
&gt;Yea, kind of boring, but if you only have about 90 mins at a time to play,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s a decent way to get exp and some money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only thing the &quot;nerf&quot; really affects would be when you have a large<br/>
&gt;group of creatures that you&#39;re kiting. I did run into some trouble when I<br/>
&gt;accidentally aggro&#39;d an entire hut plus a giant captain (4 creatures). I<br/>
&gt;ended up dying (but I can blame that on my buddy kept distracting me asking<br/>
&gt;me questions over my shoulder). Pre-nerf, it was much easier since the mobs<br/>
&gt;would instantly turn on my pet. Having to try to reissue the pet attack<br/>
&gt;command with this many mobs is much more dangerous now and allows for a<br/>
&gt;very small margin for error.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some recommendations for what makes for a good charm kiting area:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) A nice quiet area where few mobs travel through<br/>
&gt;2) A busy area nearby to get your intended victims<br/>
&gt;3) Few trees<br/>
&gt;4) Nice flat plains-like area<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve got my &quot;change views&quot; key setup as my &quot;+&quot; key on my keypad. I use my<br/>
&gt;keypad for movement, so this is very convenient for me. After I target my<br/>
&gt;&quot;pet&quot; and send him to attack my victim, I press my &quot;+&quot; key 3 times. This<br/>
&gt;gets me to the last external view before the first person perspective, so<br/>
&gt;that I only have to press the key once to get back to this view.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some places that I had very good experience charm kiting:<br/>
&gt;Rathe Mountains -- Great place for any high 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s bard. Can start<br/>
&gt;with cyclopses and work your way up to hill giants. Just zone if you get<br/>
&gt;too many (make sure you have a hot key warning people which zone you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;pulling them to). Drawbacks: can be very crowded with players and you can<br/>
&gt;end up going through hill giants so fast you clear the zone. Doesn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt;you very popular.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Karanas -- In your 30&#39;s, Froon and Choon were good for charm kiting and I<br/>
&gt;think still are. The various griffenne&#39;s are lower, but they were helpful<br/>
&gt;to kill stuff with. Mid 30&#39;s you can start using griffons and hill giants<br/>
&gt;to clear things. Mid 40 I used grimfeather to kill stuff with (definitely<br/>
&gt;keep your speed up against him) :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dreadlands -- In your 40&#39;s this is a decent place to fight. I had good<br/>
&gt;experience charming primarily giants. But also found yeti&#39;s, spiders and<br/>
&gt;drolvarg&#39;s to be charmable. The key to this place is finding a relatively<br/>
&gt;quiet area. I had a couple of places I liked to use. 1 was just to the<br/>
&gt;south of the tunnel that leads to the druid/wizzie ports. Another was just<br/>
&gt;to the East of the same tunnel where there&#39;s a little shack that leads to<br/>
&gt;the yeti caves, a nice little plains area with lots of things walking<br/>
&gt;nearby. Lastly, I started pulling from the giant fort nearby. It usually<br/>
&gt;not camped and is nice to get away from all the hubbub of the Frontier Mtns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lake of Ill Omen -- Mid 40&#39;s to 50. Here&#39;s my secret fishing hole. Well<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s not all that secret, but it&#39;s some of the best kiting exp I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
&gt;and it&#39;s helped take me from my 40&#39;s to 50. When I was around 42 I had<br/>
&gt;charm kited a pair of them and got an entire blue bubble of exp with each<br/>
&gt;kill. They are in the bottom of the lake, and are usually in pairs. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;had a fishbone earring at the time (singing steel gauntlets now) and with<br/>
&gt;my tambourine I could easily outswim the gobbies. I&#39;d chant 1, and usually<br/>
&gt;2 would come (chase view helps here). As I&#39;d pull them to the shore I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;continue hammering the one I pulled with 2 chants. When we got to shore, he<br/>
&gt;was usually down about 1/4 of a bubble. I&#39;d charm him and have him fight<br/>
&gt;his buddy. When he was low in life, I&#39;d charm his buddy to kill him. Then<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d fear-kite or chant-kite the other to death. Fear kiting was good to use<br/>
&gt;as it help keep up my combat skills. However, they can hit pretty hard so<br/>
&gt;be wary. BTW, I had one blue bubble to go to get to 50. I killed 4 of these<br/>
&gt;and dinged. The bloodgills have become more camped as time has gone on.<br/>
&gt;Obviously the word is out about them, but for us bards, it&#39;s one of the<br/>
&gt;easiest things to fight for us. Having enduring breath from a fishbone<br/>
&gt;earring was extremely helpful since I could just track down the goblin that<br/>
&gt;I wanted and pull.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, now that I&#39;ve told you all about some of the places I hang out at,<br/>
&gt;I hope to see you around. Not sure how much further past 50 I&#39;ll go since<br/>
&gt;kiting doesn&#39;t sound all that attractive with mobs summoning. But you can<br/>
&gt;be assured that I&#39;ll be giving it a try. :-)<br/>

&gt;I quit playing my bard at level 30 ( this was about 6 months ago) stripped<br/>
&gt;him of all items and started a Mage the mage is now level 46 and I would now<br/>
&gt;like to stat playing him again, I have a few items for him but mostly need<br/>
&gt;to buy/camp new gear...I&#39;m all set for weapons and instruments. I need<br/>
&gt;armor/jewelry suggestions that a 46th mage could acquire with out much help.<br/>
&gt;I have about 1k saved up. On the bard I have a troll belt(+5 STR), Star ruby<br/>
&gt;Face(+5 DEX/CHA), Dark Elf Hide Gloves(I forget stats). Also he is a 1/2 elf<br/>
&gt;with a starting STR of 90 and CHA of 85 I know I messed up but it was my<br/>
&gt;first toon&lt;shrug&gt;.<br/>
&gt;On a side note any suggestions of where to solo are welcome I know the good<br/>
&gt;group spots but am a bit out of shape soloing with out a pet :-)<br/>
&gt;Any help you can give I&#39;d be most thankful for.<br/>
