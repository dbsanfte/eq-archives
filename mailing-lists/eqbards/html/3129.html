 </span></blockquote>John and I agree in principle, although I took a bit different approach.<br/>
<br/>
I liked using the arrow keys for movement, and from the beginning I used my<br/>
left hand on them.  That&#39;s now so ingrained I have trouble using my right.<br/>
Recently it dawned on me I wasn&#39;t using the keypad, so I started remapping.<br/>
 First &quot;c&quot; went to the keypad 0 key.  Nice improvement.  Now I have:<br/>
<br/>
Keypad			Action<br/>
<br/>
Num Lock		Auto-run (default)<br/>
/			Duck (crouch/straighten)<br/>
*			Inventory<br/>
-			Screen shot (default)<br/>
7 8			Hot buttons, same ordering as they<br/>
4 5			appear on screen.<br/>
1 2<br/>
9			Perspective (1st person, above, etc.)<br/>
6			Full screen, menu screen<br/>
3			Target nearest NPC<br/>
.			Target self<br/>
+			Auto-attack<br/>
<br/>
I left targetting a party member on the function keys, slid over to F1-F6.<br/>
I could shift them right, but I don&#39;t use them all that much.  The only<br/>
other key I reach for while playing is Esc, and it&#39;s easy to hit off in its<br/>
corner.<br/>
<br/>
Playing this way I shift my keyboard somewhat left so I&#39;m comfortable with<br/>
left hand on its right side and right hand on the mouse.  For general<br/>
typing I either reach across with both hands or roll my chair a little left.<br/>
