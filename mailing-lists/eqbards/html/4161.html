<b>Subject:</b> RE: Blackened Iron Armor *SPOILER* (sort of) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758745638">I think you are missing a major point.  Most people only hand off their<br/>
armor to their 2nd and 3rd characters when they are done with them.  I doubt<br/>
they will get rubicite for example, and hand them down to one of their<br/>
characters, then go back and try again for some rubicite, and had that down.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that there are not some that do this, but from what I heard<br/>
about camping for rubicite it is an experience in frustration and most sane<br/>
players would not do it again if they absolutely didn&#39;t have too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sorry, I just had to reply to this, and then I&#39;ll let the subject drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; forever. Enough has been said about twinking. I have to say, you have to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; a real jerk to give somebody flak because they are twinked. This is<br/>
&gt; called<br/>
&gt; &gt; JEALOUSY folks. Get over it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re applying single-player game mentalities to a<br/>
&gt; multi-player game.  Spawns that give things like rubicite are<br/>
&gt; a limited resource.  If someone uses his high level character<br/>
&gt; to get equipment like that for his low level characters, he is<br/>
&gt; depriving others of the chance to get that item, thus<br/>
&gt; increasing the camping problem on that spawn.  It is not<br/>
&gt; jealousy, it is a legitimate gripe that someone has figured<br/>
&gt; out a way to cut in line and get two or more of something,<br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re still waiting in line to get one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (And I&#39;ll repeat what I said last time:  The real meta-issue<br/>
&gt; behind this problem is server overcrowding.  If the servers<br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t so crowded, this would be much less of a problem<br/>
&gt; because the &quot;lines&quot; would be shorter or nonexistant.)<br/>
