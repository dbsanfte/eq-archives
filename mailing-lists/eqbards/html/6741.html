<div id="ygrps-yiv-997258679">Since I play both a cleric and a bard, I&#39;d like to correct some of the<br/>
Cleric rumors going on around here.<br/>
<br/>
Cleric only equipment?<br/>
The first and only Cleric-only weapon (that I have heard of) was just found<br/>
on Vox.<br/>
The only Cleric-only armor is on the Plane of Fear.<br/>
<br/>
There is a quest weapon that is Cleric and Paladin, just like many items<br/>
that are Bard and Rogue only.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to hitpoints, Bards and Clerics have about the same amount.  But if you<br/>
compare a Dwarven Cleric (95 STA) to a Wood Elf Bard (65 STA) you will<br/>
probably see a difference in favor of the Cleric.  My Half Elf Bard has<br/>
higher stamina and hitpoints than my High Elf Cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Combat favors Bards.  Bards get dual wield and I believe a higher weapon<br/>
skill cap.  Clerics can do ok at melee, but are much more effective if they<br/>
are meditating during combat.  So Bards are much more effective in combat<br/>
that Clerics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Divine Aura lasts for 18 seconds, and is not perfect Invulnearbility as we<br/>
can be stunned quite easily.  I consider myself very lucky if DA actually<br/>
allows me to get to the zone before dying.  It has a 10-15 minute recycle<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Aura is more useful when used in combat.  But it doesn&#39;t work like<br/>
some of you think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Imagine the following, 4 wizards, 1 cleric.  Cleric casts smite,<br/>
&gt; then divine aura and gives the wizards 18 seconds of nuking.  In same<br/>
&gt; situation the bard would take a hell of a lot of damage trying to solo<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tank<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the same critter the cleric could.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As soon as the Wizards start nuking, the mobs will switch from the Cleric to<br/>
the Wizards.  Now the Cleric con only watch the Wizards die, as he can&#39;t<br/>
attack or cast any spells (including HEAL) until the 18 seconds wear off.<br/>
It really sucks watching a party member die because you are not allowed to<br/>
heal.<br/>
<br/>
The best way is to use DA on a pull when the puller is taking heavy damage.<br/>
Heal a couple of times when the puller shows up, and draw all the mobs to<br/>
you.  Then use DA to give everyone 18 seconds to pull them off you.  This<br/>
works ok, but in many pickup groups this would get me killed as the group<br/>
didn&#39;t understand what I was doing.  The DA would wear off and I&#39;d still<br/>
have 4 mobs on me, while all the tanks are all focusing on a single mob.<br/>
<br/>
It is much better to have an Enchanter or Bard in the group that can do<br/>
crowd control for you.<br/>
