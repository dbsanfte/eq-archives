Actually, we do get STR-based damage increases.  Our STR tends to not be on<br/>
par with a real tank&#39;s, because of the other stats we have to be conscious<br/>
of, but the higher a bard&#39;s STR, the harder we&#39;ll hit with a given weapon.<br/>
Are you referring to a different STR bonus?<br/>
<br/>
The critical hits are nice, but I tend to consider them as procs.  The<br/>
Crippling Blow is nice, but my understanding is that Warriors need to be<br/>
below a certain Health threshold for this to kick in, which they usually<br/>
won&#39;t stay at (if they&#39;re that low, a healer is gonna be healing them).  Is<br/>
that understanding incorrect?  And yes, I&#39;ll concur that monks and rogues<br/>
are just badasses (I consider them to be the melee version of a nuker).<br/>

<br/>
50% of a ranger&#39;s damage is not insignificant in my mind, considering he<br/>
gets double attack.  Again, though, you used the magic word &quot;estimated.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m looking for numbers (if you still have the logs around) -- I want to<br/>
know that X class at level L does Y damage per second against a mob of level<br/>
Z, gathered from N fights.  I&#39;m stubborn/anal that way ;).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good point on the weapons.  (Except for rangers, of course... they&#39;re<br/>
typically dual wielding Ykeshas and EBW&#39;s just like us, until they get their<br/>
planes weapons.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I often hear shouts in Guk and Sol to the effect of &quot;Enchanter or<br/>
Bard wanted.&quot;  I get invites often for dragon raids, planes raids, and Kedge<br/>
outtings.  Of course, it&#39;s usually because they want one of the Clarity<br/>
forms or to break a room.  Also, there are more bards coming of age these<br/>
days, and a group generally won&#39;t have more than one bard (unlike tanks or<br/>
casters).<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, the new Chant upgrades should make life a bit easier for the<br/>
kiting-solo bard.<br/>
