WinModems using the Lucent chipset do what you say and do not<br/>
suffer the horrendous ping times of older WinModems.  But the<br/>
older ones *do* use the CPU for the A/D and D/A de/modulation.  <br/>
Those of you using older WinModems would be well advised to<br/>
upgrade.  All my friends who&#39;ve upgraded from WinModems to<br/>
real modems report it lowered ping times by 100-200 ms (350 ms<br/>
to 150 ms in the most extreme case).<br/>
