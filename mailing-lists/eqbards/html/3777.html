<br/>
Those are your songs.  To make a song work, it is a 2 step process.  First<br/>
you scribe the song to your spell book. You only have to do this one time.<br/>
To use a song, you need to memorize it so that it appears on the left side<br/>
of your screen as an icon you can click on.  You have to do this each time<br/>
you die and need to re-learn your songs.  So don&#39;t die!  When you have it<br/>
scribes and memorized you can click on it and you will be &#39;singing&#39; that<br/>
song and the power that it gives you will happen.<br/>
<br/>
Selos Accellarando will make you feet move faster.  You will be able to run<br/>
really fast.<br/>
<br/>
Other songs have other powers, like better ability to fight, able to heal up<br/>
faster and other specail powers - read the manual and try things. Also go to<br/>
the great bard web sites and read up.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wwwharpers.net/bard">http://wwwharpers.net/bard</a><br/>

<br/>
Bards powers will affect everyone in their party.  Some bard songs are<br/>
enhanced if you play an instrument while you sing.  The first instrument to<br/>
get is a drum.  Sing Selos song & play (remove your weapons and put the drum<br/>
in your 2nd melee slot) and you will run faster than anyone else - including<br/>
the monsters.<br/>
<br/>
At your age - you should use chant of battle when fighting and hymn of<br/>
restoration for healing.  And next level 5 you can get Selos for running and<br/>
traveling. The level 2 song - chords is harder to use and you will find that<br/>
if you use it near guards they don&#39;t like it in a big way! (They will think<br/>
you are attacking them and attack you back.) So if you don&#39;t have Chords of<br/>
Dissonance - don&#39;t worry - you can buy it later on when you know how to use<br/>
it better.  But buy the Lyssa Locating song (4) for finding corpses and the<br/>
Hymn of Restoration (6) for healing and Selos (3) for running.  The chords<br/>
(2) and Jig (3) you can get later when you feel you really need them.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
