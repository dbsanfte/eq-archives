&gt;The worst are are effect spells.  Those will drop my Celeron<br/>
&gt;450 with Voodoo3 card (overclocked to 3000 speed) to about 2<br/>
&gt;frames per second, even at low particle density.<br/>

and always tell my group members they should too.  I have a PIII-450 with a <br/>
Viper 770 and 256MB of ram and I still get massive lag in caster heavy <br/>
battles.  The only problem with PD being off is that many songs and spells <br/>
give no visual clue.  Verant should make it so there is something, even a <br/>
little glow.  As it is I have to pay very close attention to the text <br/>
messages in battle to weave well, it can get very tedious.<br/>
