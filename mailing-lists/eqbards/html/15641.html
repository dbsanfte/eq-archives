&gt; that could be (or would<br/>
&gt; be) done about the situation.  However, at the end<br/>
&gt; of the night, the gm<br/>
&gt; finally asked that I write her an email explaining<br/>
&gt; the situation.  Hopefully<br/>
&gt; that will help matters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The character who actually stole it was Razel,<br/>
&gt; although he said it was his<br/>
&gt; &quot;friend&quot; Bonewalker who was playing Razel and stole<br/>
&gt; the items.  I am told<br/>
&gt; that Razel is actually a good guy and was taken<br/>
&gt; advantage of as well but I<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t know what to believe.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The funniest part of the story is that Razel<br/>
&gt; actually gave a friend of mine<br/>
&gt; all his druid items for me to hold as collateral. <br/>
&gt; However, when my friend<br/>
&gt; tried to trade them to me, one of the items was a<br/>
&gt; full LIght Burlap Sack<br/>
&gt; (which is lore).  When we hit trade, the items in<br/>
&gt; the bag and the bag itself<br/>
&gt; poofed.  And of course the gms won&#39;t believe this<br/>
&gt; either - they say my<br/>
&gt; friend kept the items but I know he did not.    So,<br/>
&gt; now I will have to<br/>
&gt; replace all this guys items as well.  I&#39;m told that<br/>
&gt; there is a fairly well<br/>
&gt; known bug with lore containers poofing but I did not<br/>
&gt; have any knowledge of<br/>
&gt; that before...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway thanks for the support friends :)<br/>

The GM&#39;s will help with the bags of stuff disappearing<br/>
durning a trade. Just state to them that you traded<br/>
the bug of stuff, please specifiy to them exactly what<br/>
was in the bag. Also make sure and tell them that you<br/>
did not set the bag on the ground. It is a known bug<br/>
to the GM&#39;s that this is happening.<br/>
This happened to me the other night, and the GM<br/>
replaced everything in the bag except for one item.<br/>
This was much more than I had expected and was very<br/>
pleased that I got anything back at all.<br/>
Good luck all and remember, the GM&#39;s may surprise you<br/>
once in a while:)<br/>
