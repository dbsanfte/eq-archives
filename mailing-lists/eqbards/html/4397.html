<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115425836">As the guy who compiled the Glossary, I actually have to agree with Bob and<br/>
Roop, etc.  I wrote the darn thing, and I *still* have to refer to it<br/>
(nope, never can remember that RTS is a Runed Totem Staff, and I *OWN*<br/>
one.)  Let&#39;s keep the acronyms to the game, please =)<br/>
<br/>
On the other side of the fence, language always has and always will<br/>
continue to change.  In fact, only in the last hundred years has the<br/>
English language stabilized to any degree.  Only technology keeps our<br/>
language from yet another &quot;Great Vowel Shift&quot; or some other linguistic<br/>
oddity.  But I don&#39;t keep the Glossary to encourage alterations or<br/>
abbreviations or acronyms.  I maintain it for two reasons: first, I am<br/>
fascinated by all aspects of language, and watching &quot;evolution in action&quot;<br/>
is just amazing to me.  Second, I saw a genuine need for clarity that<br/>
simply bitching was not going to solve.    It may not help everyone, and it<br/>
may even offend a very few, but the Glossary has been proclaimed a valuable<br/>
tool again and again, and thus, I will continue to maintain it to the best<br/>
of my abilities.<br/>
<br/>
By the by, anyone in the Qeynos/Karana area know what the heck &quot;BuP&quot; is???<br/>
In context: &quot;I usually get my food and water from BuP&quot;<br/>
PLEASE respond privately, thank you =)<br/>
