<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278736889">Hehe.. welcome to a whole new world.  I&#39;ve done this now probably 40 or 50 times.  Doesn&#39;t always turn out<br/>
great, but it sure has its rewards.  It&#39;s gotteen me 3 full bubs of level 30 exp.  That&#39;s pretty good when<br/>
you consider the 10 deaths, and the exp penalties I&#39;m getting for killing deep reds.  I don&#39;t die nearly<br/>
as often anymore.  Though I had an interesting death last weekend where the giant actually punched me to<br/>
death inside a tree.  Got a screenshot.  Maybe I&#39;ll send it to eqvault.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I get a lot of jealous onlookers.  But the thing they have to realize the ability is not all it&#39;s cracked<br/>
up to be.  First of all, it&#39;s only really useful in the 3 or 4 large outdoor zones where these things<br/>
spawn.  And really rathe mountains is the only one with enough spawn rate to maintain it for very long.<br/>
It really only works solo, as party members just get in the way and tend to get themselves or both of you<br/>
killed.  Also, it gets really boring sitting in one zone, killing giants over and over again.  Making huge<br/>
amounts of cash and exp.  I suppose I could only do this up till around level 45 before I stopped getting<br/>
exp for it.  Ok, perhaps they should be jealous.  Don&#39;t tell anyone, it&#39;ll get nerfed.  And in fact, maybe<br/>
it SHOULD get nerfed.  Though I suspect any Verant concocted solution would be completely unfair, and<br/>
probably not really solve the problem, and have 5 unintended side effects that are even worse than the<br/>
nerf.  :)<br/>

&gt; Ok, I had read here about the 30th bard saying he charmed HG&#39;s and I had<br/>
&gt; charmed Cyclopses in the past. Today I was running through NK (when I<br/>
&gt; was 32nd level)when I saw 2 HG&#39;s, I had already typed &quot;/shout 2 HG&#39;s<br/>
&gt; near Stone...&quot; when I stopped. and I thought:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Hey, I&#39;m near the zone, I&#39;m faster than these guys, what can it hurt?&quot;<br/>
&gt; so I switched to charm hotkey bank and fired it up. it failed and the HG<br/>
&gt; actually caught me and whacked me down to 1/2 health (forgot how fast<br/>
&gt; they really are). then while fleeing, I hit charm again, and it stuck. I<br/>
&gt; sic&#39;d the Hg on the other one and was able to complete the battle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately my HG lost and I was too scared to switch targets. as I<br/>
&gt; was running to the zone though, I passed a griffon. and i thought &quot;hey!&quot;<br/>
&gt; So I charmed it and sent it after the injured HG. It killed the HG<br/>
&gt; quickly and I looted it &quot;WOW&quot; 3 plat and 54 gold! and then as I was<br/>
&gt; running to the zone I passed a griffenne, so I sent my griffon to kill<br/>
&gt; it! and then i zoned :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never saw 2 HG&#39;s again, but later I saw a red griffon and a yellow HG.<br/>
&gt; I charmed the griffon and sent it against the HG. This time I did switch<br/>
&gt; targets and it was obvious my griffon was losing badly. so I switched<br/>
&gt; and charmed the HG, who won with 50% of his health left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a bit later (after a stint in HHK where I made 33rd level) I was<br/>
&gt; passing thru the oasis and I saw a yellow and red Sand Giant standing<br/>
&gt; next to each other. again I thought &quot;hey!&quot; so I charmed the red SG. it<br/>
&gt; failed about 3 times, but then it took and I had about 75% success rate<br/>
&gt; from then on out. I actually Killed a Sand Giant! and for loot I got<br/>
&gt; 44plat and a FS sword!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was amazed! we actually ARE that powerful!<br/>
