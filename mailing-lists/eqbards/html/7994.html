&gt;ladder into Perma.  I do NOT know if this would cause a train, <br/>
&gt;say at the Flag Room.  If you want to try it, use it at your own <br/>
&gt;risk :)<br/>

I grew up there between level 14 - 24, and returned after 30 for<br/>
more exploration / items.<br/>

AE songs + flag room or beyond = you are the first person to die.<br/>
Permafrost has an enormous agro range for goblins sending out help<br/>
pulses to others in the area.  I&#39;ve seen people in front of the <br/>
first gate pull things back near the alchemist room because of AE.<br/>
<br/>
Bellow is a huge no-no in Permafrost, it creates huge aggression<br/>
frenzies from goblins in completely other rooms.  I would stick<br/>
to party buff tactics, and let your group do the work.  You will<br/>
already be receiving a lot of attention from the extra goblins<br/>
anyway, AE songs will only force more monsters on you.  One<br/>
exception is AE binding / AE sleep, this slows the attacks down <br/>
enough so that you keep yourself alive, CoD/DDD and you&#39;d be<br/>
asking for goblins to come slay you.  JMO, YMMV.<br/>
