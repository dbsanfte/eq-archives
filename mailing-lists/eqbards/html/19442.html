<div id="ygrps-yiv-997885848">Generally, its difficults to have enough Guides online to have<br/>
&quot;a half dozen GM controlled mobs&quot; for the high levels.<br/>
<br/>
Look at how many guides you can get on at once in the first place.<br/>

&gt;Hasn&#39;t been that way on E&#39;ci in any of the events I&#39;ve seen.  Also it makes<br/>
&gt;events like the undead invasions totally pointless.  What<br/>
&gt;challenges a level<br/>
&gt;40+ in those case, slaughters everyone who would normally be in<br/>
&gt;one of those<br/>
&gt;zones.  Better to do that by having a horde of lower level mobs for the mid<br/>
&gt;range characters to battle, while having a half dozen or so gm controlled<br/>
&gt;mobs which concentrate on targeting the high levels who come to &quot;play&quot;<br/>
