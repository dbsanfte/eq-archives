<div id="ygrps-yiv-264594440">I&#39;ve been whooping MUCHO posterior end at the clear area just south of the<br/>
giant&#39;s camp in FV (along the wall).  I go out a ways, pull me a froggie<br/>
(most are still blue at 37) or a Drolvarg (I can take all but the Snarlers),<br/>
and the exp just rolls on in ;o)  One o these days I need to get me a Yak or<br/>
two... my Staff of Writhing and Kisch (*sighs*... I love my Kisch) are<br/>
nifty, but they really suck the stamina outta me in longer fights :o/<br/>
<br/>
I like the BP neckalce for the neck area, personally  :o)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Dex/Agi/Where to go...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ok i hate asking questions like this, but i wasted so much time last night<br/>
&gt; to get 1 bubble of xp it drove me nuts. I finally hit level 37 after<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; trained constantly last night in sol b and before that being grouped with<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; too high level group for me that got me sloooooooow xp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions other then Cazic Thule sewers for where i can hunt at 37<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; a small group (2 to 5 people)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now here&#39;s my other question, What do most of ya go for? i havent been<br/>
&gt; active on my bard for about 6 months, and his equipment has been revamped<br/>
&gt; since then since i had sold most of his stuff to equip my necro, but now<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; necro equipped him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Im currently in some:<br/>
&gt; lambent armor<br/>
&gt; crested helm<br/>
&gt; Borrowed mith bp (psst Halana, we gotta hook up!)<br/>
&gt; 2 yaks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My equipment is not complete yet, but getting there<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now here&#39;s what im getting at, I know we&#39;re fragile tanks, my yaks are<br/>
&gt; finally procing, this will taunt mobs alot im assuming since im usually<br/>
&gt; singing my heart away to buff us up. I dont wanna be hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question to you....<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions to what i could use to raise my agi to not be hit? and<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; my dex to raise my dex up to proc those swords as much as possible<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; my current stats are about 100 strenght, 122 agility, 118 or so dex, and<br/>
&gt; about 125 charisma<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; what i&#39;d like to know is what the non imbrued high lev bards are using and<br/>
&gt; what they recommend<br/>
&gt;<br/>
