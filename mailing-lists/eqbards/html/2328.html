<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341039022">It has been this way for me for some time.  Lament 2 &quot;blue&quot; Dervishes with<br/>
my mandolin, run up and punch the third in the face, get chased by one of<br/>
the dervishes supposedly lamented.  This is -without- the &quot;fails&quot; message<br/>
which sometimes sends the whole camp at me.  Same with frogloks, orcs, dead,<br/>
whatever else.<br/>
<br/>
Seems random, but I&#39;ve had it happen with all sorts of creatures from Qeynos<br/>
to Kelethin.  For several weeks at least, personally.  Used to never be like<br/>
this.<br/>
