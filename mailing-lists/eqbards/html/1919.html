<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163526925">It does a very nice job of slowing attack speed as well.  It acts like a<br/>
combination ensnare/walking sleep.  I&#39;ve not touched largo&#39;s melodic binding<br/>
since I got it, so I can&#39;t offer observations or comparisons of both of<br/>
these songs.  However being on Rallos Zek, I would prefer the 1 target<br/>
feature of chains over the AE of binding.  And like you said, it softens the<br/>
nasty reactions when a wizard gets a little too trigger happy.  It also has<br/>
an extremely high hate value, parallel to Bellow from what I&#39;ve witnessed.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The problem with this (and I was doing it too) is that Chain <br/>
&gt; just slows<br/>
&gt; the mob&#39;s movement speed from what I can tell, not it&#39;s attack speed<br/>
&gt; like Binding does. And it doesn&#39;t seem to slow the mob&#39;s <br/>
&gt; movement speed<br/>
&gt; that much until the mob is low on hp. It can help keep a very fast mob </span></blockquote></div>
