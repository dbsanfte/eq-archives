&gt;My other concern is etiquette. Nobody was around the spectres and the<br/>
&gt;island was unbroken. As soon as I broke the spawn there were 3 other groups<br/>
&gt;who jumped in and started pulling spectres. One even ran us over with their<br/>
&gt;pull while we were medding and healing. I guess it&#39;s bound to happen since<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m pulling the spectres so far away. Seems rude on from one perspective,<br/>
&gt;but from another it seems inevitable unless you are sitting smack dab on<br/>
&gt;the island.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve found that a lot on Bertoxx.  At first, I just thought it was a<br/>
&gt;coincidence that when my group broke the spawn up a bit, dr00ds started<br/>
&gt;pulling singles to kite.  However, of the past 4 or 5 times we&#39;ve hunted the<br/>
&gt;specs, the story&#39;s always the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, there&#39;s limited flat areas around the Spectre island to pull to that<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t occupied by lower levels.  Typically, most people pull to the side<br/>
&gt;with the inn on it, or at the top near the Dervish camp.  It&#39;s inevitable<br/>
&gt;that someone will pull across you, or be chasing a spectre through you,<br/>
&gt;especially if you&#39;re medding/healing on it&#39;s path.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very true. As a matter of fact, there was a Necro who was kiting the <br/>
spectres all around the lake, to the consternation of the orc highway <br/>
hunters. This same necro charmed a spectre that we were fear-kiting. He <br/>
then proceeded to run away. Eventually the charm broke and we fought it, <br/>
but it wasn&#39;t until after I looked through my logs and sent him a tell that <br/>
he apologized and said it was an accident. I wasn&#39;t too impressed and it <br/>
didn&#39;t surprise me that a little later he sent a shout to the entire zone <br/>
to help pull some spectres off of him.<br/>
