again.  Qeynos Hills and our little quiet haven of Kithicor now run<br/>
rampant with undead after the sun sets.  The Carson McCabe of CazicThule<br/>
warned us that this was a permanent change, and that the link to the Plane<br/>
of Hate had been &quot;weakened&quot; due to this incident.  He did not tell us<br/>
where the gateway was, rumors include somewhere in Kithicor and deep<br/>
inside Neriak Third Gate.<br/>
<br/>
Arguably the most humorous part of last night&#39;s proceedings was when<br/>
Carson ran around killing guards and looting them, saying that they had<br/>
stolen money from the vault, so he could continue handing out his 20p<br/>
reward to each person present.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone get a bardic item from him?  There were a few classes he seemed<br/>
to overlook when handing out the non-monetary gifts.<br/>
