&gt; tested that rumor out. I had her meditate for 15 mins to make sure she had a<br/>
&gt; total bar of mana. had her cast chaotic feedback a major DD spell on her<br/>
&gt; self till she was out of mana. then i we timed how long it took her to<br/>
&gt; meditate. it took about 5 mins for her to get a full mana bar back at lvl 18<br/>
&gt; with her wearing 0 int and mana giving items. we did it again and this time<br/>
&gt; i sang the Jig and timed it once again this time it took about 4 mins<br/>
&gt; 13seconds to get the mana bar back up. so it does help slightly. My theory<br/>

was real?  There&#39;s a phantom mana bug with Clarity, where<br/>
sometimes the mana bar will appear to fill faster than your<br/>
real mana.  But when you cast a spell, the server sends the<br/>
client the correct amount, and that first spell seems to use a<br/>
lot more mana than it should.  This is a client/server synch<br/>
problem of undetermined origin, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if<br/>
our other songs could cause it.<br/>
