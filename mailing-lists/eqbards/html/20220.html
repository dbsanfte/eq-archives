<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209434003">Cool, sounds like I&#39;ll have more Enchanter friendly options soon.  It&#39;s been<br/>
about 10 levels now since I really felt comfortable grouping with an<br/>
enchanter.  I used Siren&#39;s last night in a group and it was pretty<br/>
effective.  The necromancer was laughing pretty hard at the antics of &#39;My&#39;<br/>
war boned skeleton.  He was very jealous of &#39;My&#39; skeletons superior sitting<br/>
skills, heh heh.<br/>

It&#39;s very common for me to be grouped with an enchanter.  In fact, an<br/>
enchanter, bard, and monk are the core of our 6 person Fire Giant runs (WAY<br/>
fun).  We also add a shaman, a cleric, and the 6th has been a paladin<br/>
(because<br/>
he&#39;s my game husband hehe) but that is the spot to put another class.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, one group, or the core group for a larger Sebilis raid, almost<br/>
always has a bard and an enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
The bard is needed to cut the down time.  I agree with Lyrnia ( believe it<br/>
was<br/>
her) that our strength lies there.  But I have pulled in Sebilis, done crowd<br/>
control, been battle bard...just adapted to the conditions.</div>
