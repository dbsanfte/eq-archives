<div id="ygrps-yiv-725744184">The first thing I did when I got this song was to test this very thing.<br/>
Picking on one of the Splitpaw gnolls in South Karana, I put one to sleep<br/>
with my song and quickly evacuated the area. I was well clear when it awoke<br/>
again but it still came after me. Even a quick application of Lament while<br/>
it nodded was not enough to stop it from chasing me down.<br/>

The things you have to remember with the lullaby are:<br/>
<br/>
b) This song only makes it forget that it&#39;s mad at you &quot;right now&quot;.  If<br/>
you are the sort of person that it gets mad at normally, and you&#39;re<br/>
still around when the song wears off, it will get mad at you again.  If<br/>
it helps you anyway, think of it as waking up and thinking that it&#39;s<br/>
attacking you for the first time again.  :)<br/>
<br/>
In theory, you should be able to start singing this song, put things<br/>
around you to sleep, then run away quickly so that when they wake up,<br/>
they will have forgotten about you and go on their merry way.  In<br/>
practice, not only for the reasons listed above, this is tricky to<br/>
achieve.<br/>
