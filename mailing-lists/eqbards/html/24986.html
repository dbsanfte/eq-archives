<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025356863">Hiya all,<br/>
I the past I have received excellent advise from this list so I turn to you<br/>
again...<br/>
I quit playing my bard at level 30 ( this was about 6 months ago) stripped<br/>
him of all items and started a Mage the mage is now level 46 and I would now<br/>
like to stat playing him again, I have a few items for him but mostly need<br/>
to buy/camp new gear...I&#39;m all set for weapons and instruments. I need<br/>
armor/jewelry suggestions that a 46th mage could acquire with out much help.<br/>
I have about 1k saved up. On the bard I have a troll belt(+5 STR), Star ruby<br/>
Face(+5 DEX/CHA), Dark Elf Hide Gloves(I forget stats). Also he is a 1/2 elf<br/>
with a starting STR of 90 and CHA of 85 I know I messed up but it was my<br/>
first toon&lt;shrug&gt;.<br/>
On a side note any suggestions of where to solo are welcome I know the good<br/>
group spots but am a bit out of shape soloing with out a pet :-)<br/>
Any help you can give I&#39;d be most thankful for.<br/>
