<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I wish our lambent armor was NO DROP, definitely.  This isn&#39;t the<br/>
&gt;   first time, I&#39;ve said it.  Won&#39;t be the last.  I try to /feedback<br/>
&gt;   my ideas, but nothing has ever come from it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think ALL the quest armor for all the classes should be NO DROP.<br/>
<br/>
And I think items should have level limits on them.  If they can put a limit<br/>
on procing, they can put a limit on being able to hold/wear an item. &quot;You<br/>
feel as though the magic within this item would overwhelm you.&quot;  not<br/>
necessarily all &quot;powerful&quot; items, but a lot of them.<br/>
<br/>
of course, this will never happen. :)<br/>
