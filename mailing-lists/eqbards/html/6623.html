<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070910766">absolutely.  i don&#39;t understand the reversal of lustrous russett from<br/>
warrior only to all plate wearers.  it is obviously intended to be warrior<br/>
only and i hope they change it back.  every armor from PoF is class specific<br/>
to one class.  lustrous russett should be no different.<br/>

&gt; patch that were<br/>
&gt; reversed yesterday? (Box of abu ja&#39;far [sorry, cannot resist <br/>
&gt; : )], Hero Bracer<br/>
&gt; etc.)  Personally, i think the Lustrous Russet armor SHOULD <br/>
&gt; BE warrior only,<br/>
&gt; but they should have made it so instantly when they <br/>
&gt; discovered the error. </span></blockquote></div>
