&gt;  We have had a major exodus of higher level players from our guild as well,<br/>
&gt;Excalibur on Xegony. Also a friend of ours is in Dark Legion and receently<br/>
&gt;internal strife has conspired to turn him into the new guild leader for<br/>
&gt;them. I think the old leader left or quit the game. He was asking us the<br/>
&gt;same questions you have.<br/>
&gt;  When this summer rolled around, there just seemed to be lots of unrest in<br/>
&gt;people. We in Excalibur have clamped down very hard on admitting new members<br/>
&gt;after the guild grew quite rapidly in spite of some efforts we made to<br/>
&gt;control the growth. We also had a couple people tenatively joined who nearly<br/>
&gt;ruined our rep overnight. We prefer to have a guild where we all know and<br/>
&gt;respect each other. Excalibur is an old guild and even has real life<br/>
&gt;meetings twice a year for those who can make it. It&#39;s also mostly adults,<br/>
&gt;even old folks like me, (35). It&#39;s based on the principles of honor and<br/>
&gt;chivarly, www.orderexcal.com if you are interested in reading further. While<br/>
&gt;I am relatively new to the guild, some folks have been in for many years and<br/>
&gt;gone through many games. We still have some active members in Illusia.<br/>
&gt;  Lately, many folks in EQ have had to reduce playtime or stop for RL<br/>
&gt;reasons, some are a bit bored and split their time with other games, and<br/>
&gt;this meant we have fewer folks available for the big stuff. This prompted<br/>
&gt;the departure of most of the higher levels for the latest hot guild on<br/>
&gt;Xegony. Most stated their reaosn was to be able to do the big things. This<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t the first time it has happened. The previous summer almost the same<br/>
&gt;thing happened, those folks that left ended up as some of the first Inner<br/>
&gt;Circle members. Lately the guild list is about equal to my friends list, but<br/>
&gt;we had lots of complaining when the guild seemed huge and no one recognized<br/>
&gt;anyone on chat. Now we&#39;re much much smaller and people complain we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&#39;do&#39; anything. I just don&#39;t think there is a perfect answer and I think most<br/>
&gt;guilds probably go through these shrink and swell cycles for the same<br/>
&gt;variety of reasons. My biggest barrier to &#39;doing&#39; things is time, not guild,<br/>
&gt;so I see no need to change guilds. I am happier with the small guild on the<br/>
&gt;whole, there&#39;s much less whining and complaining at least. Then there&#39;s the<br/>
&gt;matter of my solemn oath of honor to the Queen. We&#39;re not the roleplay<br/>
&gt;police but I really do take the principles behind it all seriously.<br/>
&gt;  Being in a guild seems necessary in EQ, it classifies or identifies you to<br/>
&gt;some extent to people who don&#39;t know you personally. My advice on being in a<br/>
&gt;guild is be in one you personally are happy with, whose goals are similar to<br/>
&gt;your goals, and people you can have fun with. After all, EQ is just a game!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Geez, you guys have to stop writing so much. You&#39;re keeping me from my <br/>
work. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you milady wholeheartedly. Just have fun with the people who <br/>
are in your guild and help everyone else enjoy their time in Norrath (gee, <br/>
could that be like real life as well?)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been through this a lot. First guild folded due to attrition (higher <br/>
level characters switched servers). My 2nd guild imploded due to internal <br/>
strife. My 3rd guild that I just recently join, Red Sky, is just now <br/>
starting to go through some of this and I&#39;m starting to think that this is <br/>
pretty much inevitable with any large guild. However, I feel that Red Sky <br/>
will get through this as there&#39;s a very strong guild leader who doesn&#39;t <br/>
take guff from anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Red Sky has an &quot;honor&quot; system. If you bring dishonor to the guild, <br/>
not only does it count against you, but also everyone who sponsored you <br/>
into the guild. Also, you need 5 sponsors in order to get in, not just 1.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the universal gripe I seem to hear. There&#39;s a core group of high <br/>
level characters who play all the time and level very fast. They eventually <br/>
want to do planes/dragon raids and there might not always be enough people <br/>
to do these with. Even if there are, the lower level chars get jealous and <br/>
complain that there&#39;s only guild raids for higher level characters. The <br/>
solution for this is to have the lower level characters start up their own <br/>
raids.<br/>
<br/>
Size of the guild is always a problem. Too small and your guild has a high <br/>
probability of dying to attrition and can&#39;t do some of the bigger raids <br/>
easily. Too big, and you lose that &quot;family&quot; feeling.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, accept that change is inevitable, enjoy the group you play <br/>
with, and if the guild isn&#39;t the way you want it and you can&#39;t change it, <br/>
find a new guild or create your own.<br/>
<br/>
My friends and I created our own guild. If my wife and I can play, we have <br/>
a phone tree and call up a couple of people, who then call the others. We <br/>
play about 2 hours then log off as it gets late. We don&#39;t have enough <br/>
people for the 10 person min, but a few guildmates and other friends let us <br/>
use some of their lesser characters to keep our guild alive. The main <br/>
benefits of having our own guild name is we get less people contacting us <br/>
to join us (oh, are you on a guild raid?) and we can chat with each other <br/>
when we&#39;re spread out pre-group. We do invite others in the zone to join <br/>
us, but we make sure they know that we&#39;re only on for a couple of hours max.<br/>
<br/>
Argh, now I&#39;ve got to get some work done. :-) Happy Hunting All and save <br/>
some mead for me!!<br/>
