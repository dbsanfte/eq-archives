<div id="ygrps-yiv-241302466">the early problem that took long to fix was proc&#39;ing weapons sticking our<br/>
songs.  the later problem that was resolved much faster (within 1 patch) was<br/>
where a proc&#39;ing weapon would not proc while singing a song.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hmm. The only issue I remember with bard weapon procs was when the<br/>
&gt; weapon proc&#39;ing would lock up your songs so you had to camp or zone to<br/>
&gt; clear it. (actually it was discovered rapidly clicking your hotkeys<br/>
&gt; would fix it but very few seemed to know about that trick)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That didn&#39;t get fixed for a couple of months after I first ran across<br/>
&gt; it. </span></blockquote></div>
