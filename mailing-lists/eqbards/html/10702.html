<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049850159">Probably the most depressing thing about the Lambent armor quests (for <br/>
me) is the fact that all of these things are heavily camped on weekends. <br/>
Of the eight quest objects and three stones that I got over the last two <br/>
weekends, I earned exactly two of them in combat.  Everything else I <br/>
looted when the camping group let me take a turn, or (in the case of the <br/>
stones) was handed to me.<br/>
<br/>
The upside to this is that lower level Bards can probably expect to get <br/>
Lambent Armor much earlier than Verant probably intended.  Because <br/>
all of the components are no-drop (and hence financially worthless), most <br/>
groups will let you loot the stuff for nothing.  Just go on the weekend <br/>
when it&#39;s crowded, and bring a good book.<br/>
