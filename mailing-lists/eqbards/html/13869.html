<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128235134">They&#39;ve taken the right steps with the planes, they just need to implement<br/>
these strategies elsewhere.  In PoF, PoH items drop pretty randomly.  There<br/>
are no mobs to &#39;camp&#39;.  PoA drops seem even more random, with no speficic<br/>
loot being tied to a specific type of mob.  PoA literally has over 100 quest<br/>
components that drop randomly and must be collected in order to obtain an<br/>
item.<br/>
Paw was redesigned this way, with random items dropping off random mobs (for<br/>
the most part), so at least we know that they&#39;re starting to think in this<br/>
direction.<br/>

&gt; Not totally as it would force someone to hunt down 12 randomly placed<br/>

&gt; mobs to get a Ykesha quality item rather than just waiting around until<br/>
one<br/>

it<br/>

I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t see the difference except one of degree.<br/>
<br/>
One named mob, randomly placed drops the Ykesha.  Tracking<br/>
helps, running around killing stuff (to make more stuff<br/>
spawn) helps.<br/>

12 &quot;special&quot; mobs, randomly placed to drop items you need for<br/>
the Ykesha quest.  Tracking helps, running around killing<br/>
stuff (to make more stuff spawn) helps.<br/>
<br/>
Just what do you gain by doing it the latter way that you<br/>
can&#39;t duplicate with tweaks to the former way?<br/>
