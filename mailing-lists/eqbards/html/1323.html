<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633245372">The lullaby does clear the hate list, it clears everyone else in the hate <br/>
list except the bard who sang it!  For this reason, bards are the best class <br/>
for saving newbies from trains.  And yes, it is also very good for twinking.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby can be very useful if you have a rogue and healer in your group and <br/>
fighting multiple mobs.  While you sleep the rest of the mobs, the rogue can <br/>
backstab the one you are fighting and the cleric can heal you.  But I <br/>
usually don&#39;t use lullaby unless there is a healer in the group and everyone <br/>
in the group knows what the ASSIST command is for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yes I know that.  What I was wondering was if someone has<br/>
&gt;fought a mob past half dead (at which point it would normally<br/>
&gt;be almost impossible to pull the mob off him), can you fire up<br/>
&gt;the song and mob will now attack the bard or the next person<br/>
&gt;to attack him?  That&#39;s what I was trying to figure out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nevertheless, even if this effect exists, hatred for the bard<br/>
&gt;seems to be excepted (stuff you put to sleep for a long time<br/>
&gt;will attack you until they die even though someone else is<br/>
&gt;killing it), which kinda makes it useless except for a<br/>
&gt;twinking exploit.<br/>
