<div id="ygrps-yiv-673262115">Even before I was a bard, I would find various instrument parts for sale<br/>
throughout Norrath. I have seen lute strings, flute mouthpiece, etc. Now<br/>
that I am a bard I find myself asking, what have I missed that I have no<br/>
idea how these items may be used. Any ideas?<br/>
