&gt;I know this is completely off-topic, but some guildmates are getting married<br/>
&gt;this week and have been unable to find a recipe for Wedding Cake.  If anyone<br/>
&gt;here can help out, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
**wedding cake: 2 clumps of dough + 1 cake round + 3 winter chocolate + 1<br/>
frosting + 3 spice (oven)<br/>
**clump of dough: 1 flour + 1 snake egg + 1 milk (mixing bowl)<br/>
**winter chocolate: 2 frosting + 1 brownie parts (mixing bowl)<br/>
<br/>
i hope *crosses fingers* that this is somewhat accurate and that you&#39;ll be<br/>
able to discover the true recipie by the weddings<br/>
