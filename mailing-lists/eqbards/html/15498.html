&gt; Ogre bouncers, imo, have not been good experience.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After spending some time in a group of 2 at bouncers, Sol B,<br/>
and Lower Guk, I&#39;d have to say it all really depends on how<br/>
crowded the zone is.  In a group of two, we were basically<br/>
able to kill stuff non-stop (I&#39;d pull while the paladin medded<br/>
from the heals he just cast), and the experience was<br/>
phenomenal - like a bubble every couple hours.  Then another<br/>
big group would move in nearby, cut off our supply of stuff to<br/>
kill, and our exp rate plummeted.  Same thing with bouncers -<br/>
pull as many as you like and the experience is pretty good (I<br/>
didn&#39;t try them until they were almost green).  Another group<br/>
moves in and the exp gain drops.<br/>
<br/>
So if the zone is crowded, you may want to try forming a small<br/>
group and finding a small nook or cranny that isn&#39;t hunted<br/>
much.<br/>
