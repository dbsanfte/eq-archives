&gt; Crier,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you very much for your plug of CZ. I am about sick of camping<br/>
&gt; Highpass Keep, and as looking for some yummier spots. (ie non boring)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am attaching a post I sent to EQ-Baking... This will explain to everyone<br/>
&gt; how to get good baking skills with minimum cost.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Baking seems to be the only skill I could afford to get to master, due to<br/>
&gt; its relativly low cost and VERY nice profit margin once you get a high<br/>
&gt; skill. (As a Bard, 75 INT does not lend itself to learning skills)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be sure and read the PS of my post below to learn to power bake yourself<br/>
&gt; to 135.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For a primer on baking, goto <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.loreseekers.com/guides/baking.html">http://www.loreseekers.com/guides/baking.html</a><br/>

&gt; ------ REPOST from EQ-Baking ------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once again, I&#39;ll rant about the benefits of fish fillets!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is the profit for fish fillets : (This is for the benefit of everone)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1 Fresh Fish (26 Copper) + 1 Jug of Sauce (10 Copper)<br/>
&gt;                         = 2 Cakes that sell for 58 copper each<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Hence 36 copper becomes 116. Thats MORE THAN TRIPLE.<br/>
&gt;         (Barring no failures)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Net result ? Backpack full of fish and backpack full of sauce<br/>
&gt; yield 12.8pp when done, without failures.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do 2 sets of these, and you will prolly have paid for all the<br/>
&gt; fish/batwings it took to get you to 120+ (see PS below) there<br/>
&gt; is NO other skill out there that can recover your inital investment<br/>
&gt; this quickly, AND have a great profit base for the forseeable future.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Point of reference, an enchanter friend of mine went to 135 in 2 hours,<br/>
&gt; recovered all his investment, and was making a profit in 3).<br/>
&gt; And get this... YOU CAN DO IT WHILE MEDDING! (Yes! that means<br/>
&gt; all you finger wiggling bookworms can make money while you med!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other nice thing is that I was able to AFFORD to get my<br/>
&gt; baking skill to 135 with a 75 INT. (Bards dont need INT)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Remember : The above is with 111 CHA and Aimiable faction.<br/>
&gt; (Bards can &#39;faction bend themselves, and CHA is a primary<br/>
&gt;  bard stat)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Master Baker (135), Just need to get some darn snake eggs to make pies<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS. Quick Recipie for &#39;power bakers&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Goto E. Freeport, buy 2 backpacks of fish at the docks.<br/>
&gt; Goto W. Freeport, buy 2 backpacks of batwings at the Arcane Shop<br/>
&gt;         (Magician Shop, 2nd floor, first woman on right)<br/>
&gt; Make Fish Rolls, Welcome to Everclick!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wash. Rinse. Repeat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Fish Rolls triv out at 135, you are getting to about 120<br/>
&gt;  to make the fillets (which triv out out 85) fail less)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I KNOW the above is not profitable, just easy, since the zones are<br/>
&gt; right next to each other and you can do all this quickly.<br/>

&gt; &gt; As an aside, I cook - I actually carry a spit around with me.  For a<br/>
&gt; female<br/>
&gt; &gt; half-elf bard this is really in character, plus it&#39;s a ton of fun.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; cooking skill has gotten up to where I can make cookies, so I try to<br/>
&gt; carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; around cookies and milk and pass them out to folks that I like.  While<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; is VERY entertaining, it also provides you and your group with an<br/>
&gt; endless<br/>
&gt; &gt; supply of Lizard-On-A-Stick, Beer Braised Gator, and Pickled Lizard.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; usual group members in Cazic-Thule now just say &quot;Hey Crier, rattle them<br/>
&gt; pots<br/>
&gt; &gt; and pans for me, I&#39;m low on food.&quot;  I normally buy my cooking supplies<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; East Commonlands at one of the bldgs adjacent to the first Inn, however,<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; I run out of Sauces or Spices while in Cazic-Thule I run up to the Oggok<br/>
&gt; &gt; gate in Feerrott and buy from Bup the vendor outside.  Bup is<br/>
&gt; indifferent to<br/>
&gt; &gt; me, and was green the first time I ever conned him at 31st or 32nd.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; only risk here is the wandering Bouncer, but I have yet to see one near<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; vendor.  He doesn&#39;t sell food, but he does sell milk if you get thirsty.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Otherwise the nearest &quot;good&quot; vendor is over in Rathe Mts. at the Inn or<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gypsy camp.<br/>
