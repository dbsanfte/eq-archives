<div id="ygrps-yiv-131789287">Corpse recovery in Cazic should go fine once you get your hands on a flute.  <br/>
I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time there, and Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding works <br/>
wonderfully.  Lizards just run past in that wierd slow-mo jogging they do, <br/>
and I&#39;ve never had Shauri&#39;s drop when I was playing it - on those rare <br/>
occasions when I get a &quot;You feel yourself starting to appear&quot; message, the <br/>
next pulse refreshes invis, so no worries.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s only one lizard in Cazic Thule (as far as I know from scouting <br/>
pretty much the whole place on many occasions) who can cast see invis, and <br/>
that&#39;s Radiant (who as I recall is an enchanter in the low 20&#39;s).  He&#39;s <br/>
usually wandering the maze, so watch out. All the other casters (jud, just, <br/>
page, et al) are too busy casting Spirit of the Torpid Lizard, or whatever <br/>
they cast to buff themselves (they cast all the time, but it never seems to <br/>
DO anything that I can see).<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet is to get someone in their 30&#39;s or higher that you know and <br/>
trust to pull you out.  Your next best bet is to get a flute, get someone to <br/>
cast SoW on you, and run in invisibly.  When you get to your corpse, drag it <br/>
to the zone and loot there... just in case Radiant decides to pay you a <br/>
surprise visit.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
