<b>Subject:</b> Re: Bards vs Enchanters Part 2 with a little Lullaby thrown in (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380563996">Greetings!<br/>
I would try the two bards sing Lullaby somewhere else before getting too <br/>
excited that is works so well.  I am very sorry to say that the pathing is <br/>
so messed up at the top of that temple that if you stay out of melee range <br/>
of the lizzies (and off the steps, any steps) you can effectively cheat by <br/>
using ranged attack.  Since the lizzies get &quot;stuck&quot; in place, by being out <br/>
of their melee range just sit back and use casters or whatever to kill em.  <br/>
Very very poor sport.  I don&#39;t do this.  I have seen a bard climb the roof, <br/>
lev off, and run around aggro&#39;ing all the lizzies around the temple then <br/>
stand on steps at top of temple.  The lizzies come to him, ignoring all <br/>
others.  He climbs roof, then rest of group slays lizzies which do not even <br/>
fight back.  I have seen it and thought it a shame.  I even grouped in a <br/>
group that did this, before I realized what was really happening.  Maybe it <br/>
is just the Cazic-Thule server that this phenom happens, but i would <br/>
recommend trying Lullaby somewhere else with two bards to be sure it is not <br/>
the poor pathing in the temple.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Slowly but surely, we killed off the intial 10 mobs.  However, this took us <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;long that as we got down to the last few mobs, new ones spawned along the <br/>
&gt;steps.<br/>
&gt;I just kept singing Lullaby the entire fight.  Eventually we killed off all <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;mobs.  All told, I think we were fighting lizards continuously for over 15<br/>
&gt;minutes.   We all stood around in disbelief at what we had just <br/>
&gt;accomplished.<br/>
&gt;Final tally was Us:15 Lizards:0.  Everyone started hooting and hollering <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;patting each other on the back.  Everyone was out of mana but no one was <br/>
&gt;below<br/>
&gt;60% health.  Everyone agreed that the reason for our success were me and <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;other bard keeping all the mobs out of the fight.  To say the least I was<br/>
&gt;ecstatic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In hindsight, I wished I would have turned on the log file function prior <br/>
&gt;to the<br/>
&gt;fight so I could have collected some test data for the ongoing Lullaby <br/>
&gt;issue.<br/>
&gt;Like so many of us, I was convinced the song was broken.  It may be that <br/>
&gt;two<br/>
&gt;bards singing Lullaby (one continuously and the other weaving it in) <br/>
&gt;negated the<br/>
&gt;problem of mobs still attacking after the initial resist.  Even if a mob<br/>
&gt;resisted my song the first time, he still had to resist the other bards <br/>
&gt;song.<br/>
&gt;I think it also helped that my charisma was 149 and the other bards was 145<br/>
&gt;(with sympathetic aura buff).  All I can say is that last night was the <br/>
&gt;most fun<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve had playing EQ in a long time and that I&#39;m further convinced that a <br/>
&gt;bard<br/>
&gt;and enchanter in the same group make a lethal combination.<br/>
