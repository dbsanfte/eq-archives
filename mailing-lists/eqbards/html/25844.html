Shadows of Lust: Subconsciously Selling Sex, Power, and Prestige in an <br/>
EverQuest┬« Expansion Advertisement<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The business man&#39;s hunt for sales boosters is leading him into a strange <br/>
wilderness: the subconscious mind.&quot;<br/>
(Wall Street Journal, pg. 1. qtd. Packard 22)<br/>
<br/>
Mike turns twenty-three this year. He is a single male and recent college <br/>
graduate who earns about $20 per hour. He casually plays some computer <br/>
games, surfs the net, and chats online. In early 2002, Mike visits a <br/>
computer game retail store to consider how he will spend some of his free <br/>
time and money. He browses the pages of<br/>
PCGamer, &quot;The World&#39;s Best-Selling Computer Game Magazine&quot; (Imagine Media). <br/>
One third of the way through he pauses to look at a folded, three-page wide <br/>
advertisement insert.<br/>
<br/>
Underneath the embossed small-capitalized, gold letters of &quot;EverQuest┬«&quot; <br/>
lies the title of the painting, &quot;The Shadows of Luclin tm.&quot; A globe fills <br/>
the black sky background; in it swirl clouds, land, and water. In the <br/>
foreground stands a tiger-man with sword and a snarling wolf, both looking <br/>
off page. A fair elf-maiden in soft, scanty clothing suddenly glances into <br/>
the eyes of the viewer. Although her expression is neutral, her lips <br/>
slightly part. Mike unfolds the advertisement, buys the game, and starts his<br/>
subscription to the service required to play the game, because he has <br/>
subconsciously longed to become that tiger and meet that woman. Mike is a <br/>
hypothetical example of the target viewer of the advertisement: single <br/>
male, age 20-25 (Castronova 24), computer savvy, and familiar with the <br/>
fantasy-genre (Yee). What appears to be an advertisement for a game service <br/>
is much more; it is a subconscious advertisement for sex, power, and prestige.<br/>
<br/>
The advertisement consciously sells technical power. The copy stresses the <br/>
technical power of this game: &quot;high-resolution&quot;, &quot;complete 3D overhaul&quot;, <br/>
with &quot;over four times the number of polygons&quot; (Sony). The advertisement <br/>
mentions this evidence to persuade the reader that he will become more <br/>
technically powerful by using this game. The advertisement includes a <br/>
sweepstakes that sells power to the customer. The sweepstakes is rich with <br/>
allusions to what the &quot;Power Player&quot; (Sony) may win: the &quot;most incredible <br/>
PC gaming system available&quot; (Sony). Superlatives topple over each other to <br/>
impress the viewer about its power and speed. For example, the manufacturer <br/>
cleverly compares the machine to a bird of prey and the speed of sound by <br/>
dubbing the computer both &quot;Falcon&quot; and &quot;MACH V&quot;. This technical power <br/>
appeals to the target white-collar male. Mechanical, or in this case <br/>
computational, power reassures him of his masculinity (Packard 74). <br/>
Although a computer is not as masculine as a car, anything that is more <br/>
powerful is a symbolic increase of the owner&#39;s virility (Packard 75).<br/>
<br/>
The advertisement&#39;s painting uses the tiger-man as a syntagm (an object <br/>
that symbolically represents a concept within a paradigm, Dyer 126) to sell <br/>
male sexual power. A tiger-man stands, ready to fight in the painting&#39;s <br/>
foreground. The tiger is a symbol of sexual power in Asia and is at least a <br/>
symbol of practical power in the West. Here he accentuates his virility. He <br/>
carries a sword, reveals his sharp fangs and muscular form. His fur color <br/>
is almost a fiery orange. He stands in a dominant position, about one-foot <br/>
higher than the delicate elf-maiden. These details communicate to the <br/>
viewer that this male model is dominant (Dyer 97-100). Although probably <br/>
unintentional by the artist, the viewer will at least subconsciously notice <br/>
that the tiger-man and elf-maiden come close to joining. The tiger-man <br/>
handles a snarling wolf, which in some ways is an extension of himself. It <br/>
shares similar fangs, fur, a white underside, and a potent demeanor. <br/>
Because the tiger-man has a humanoid body and tiger&#39;s head, the target <br/>
viewer identifies with him. The animal head is like a theatrical, <br/>
religious, or mythic mask. The tiger is the target viewer&#39;s self-image <br/>
(Packard 45).  Any male can symbolically become the tiger. The viewer, <br/>
invoking the tiger, feels vigor, power, and virility. Thus a bond is made. <br/>
As Dyer wrote: &quot;[O]nce this initial connection has been made we almost <br/>
automatically accept the object for the feeling.&quot; (116)<br/>
<br/>
Besides power, the viewer has another reason to identify with the <br/>
tiger-man: to meet the woman of his dreams (Packard 74). The elf-maiden in <br/>
this painting is the ideal girlfriend of the target viewer. Except for her <br/>
pointed ears, she looks completely human. But she does not look like just <br/>
any human. To the target viewer, she is an ideal sex-image. She appears to <br/>
be a fair-skinned, slender woman about eighteen to twenty-two years old, <br/>
which is ideal for the target market. She adorns herself in scanty, <br/>
form-fitting clothing. She has long blonde hair, which may symbolically <br/>
represent healthy sexuality (Dyer 135). Her pose and scanty clothing reveal <br/>
most of her body to the viewer, which allows him to judge her beautiful <br/>
physique. The viewer has a lot to like. She wears soft, delicate, baby blue <br/>
colors, which helps make her seem innocent and virginal. Therefore, she has <br/>
some of the characteristics of an archetypal maiden, although this one is <br/>
not a helpless maiden. Her staff symbolizes that she is powerful. So far, <br/>
her body and clothes communicate her beauty, power, and innocence.<br/>
<br/>
But the attraction extends beyond the flesh, because she shares one of the <br/>
interests of the viewer: interest in the fantasy genre. She wears fantastic <br/>
clothes, carries a magical staff, and adorns herself with exotic emerald <br/>
jewelry. That is rare. Male fantasy-genre fans vastly outnumber female fans <br/>
on Earth. Most women have little interest in the fantasy genre and have <br/>
little interest in a Dungeons & DragonsR-style game, but she has great <br/>
interest in it. She participates in an exciting battle against fantastic <br/>
foes. To the target viewer, this increases her appeal and partly bridges <br/>
lust to romance.<br/>
<br/>
Yet romance requires mutual interest, and some exists here. She at least <br/>
recognizes the viewer. Out of the ten humanoids in the painting, she is the <br/>
only one that is gazing into the eyes of the viewer. She looks at him with <br/>
a neutral expression, but lips slightly parted. She establishes eye <br/>
contact. By virtue of the stillness of a painting, she maintains eye <br/>
contact indefinitely. She gets the viewer&#39;s attention and transfers it, by <br/>
her pose, to the rest of the painting to her right.<br/>
<br/>
The whole of the painting evokes nostalgia in the target viewer. The art <br/>
style is reminiscent of Dungeons & Dragons┬« games and fantasy novel covers, <br/>
which the target viewer has probably seen (Yee). The characters and <br/>
creatures are straight from common fantasy novels and games. The title <br/>
&quot;EverQuest┬«&quot; sells the core activity of fantasy novels: the quest. The <br/>
subtitle &quot;The Shadows of Luclin tm&quot; reminds the viewer of common fantasy <br/>
novel and game titles. Thus, this ad offers roots. It appeals to the viewer <br/>
who has played or read the fantasy genre. The target viewer needs these <br/>
roots (Packard 76).<br/>
<br/>
The product&#39;s service gives the viewer companions to share these roots <br/>
with. The ad repeatedly hammers the companionship available: &quot;Join hundreds <br/>
of thousands of real people&quot;, &quot;make friends&quot;, &quot;take part&quot;, and &quot;play <br/>
cooperatively&quot; (Sony). Appeal to companionship helps sell the product <br/>
(Packard 272).<br/>
<br/>
If sex or companionship fail, then all is not lost for the publisher. The <br/>
advertisement also gratifies the viewer&#39;s ego and reassures his worth <br/>
(Packard 72). The golden warrior in the center of combat is rich. His armor <br/>
is rich and prestigious. By transference, the owner of the armor is rich <br/>
and prestigious. By identification, the viewer accepts the self-image of <br/>
the golden warrior. The viewer can become the golden warrior. He is <br/>
positioned facing away from the viewer, so his face is not visible. The <br/>
viewer may imagine the face to be the viewer&#39;s own face. This position is <br/>
also similar to a third-person view that is used in many games.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Shadows of Luclin tm&quot; expansion advertisement communicates much more <br/>
than a casual observation would consciously recognize. The advertisement <br/>
wins the heart of the target viewer, usually without the target viewer <br/>
being aware of the influence. The artful advertisement may influence the <br/>
target viewer to buy the product and service without being aware of why. If <br/>
asked, the viewer might rationalize that he had been sold a game (Packard <br/>
14), but the nonverbal offer was sex, power, and prestige.<br/>
