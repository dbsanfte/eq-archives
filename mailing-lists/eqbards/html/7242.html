Something a little lighter for your perusal<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a high and twisty rampway, east of Qeynos Hills<br/>
&gt; You can listen to the Griffawn screechin&#39; out his killing song<br/>
&gt; You can think about the Mucktails, or the gnoll you slew the night before <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But your feet will soon be wanderin&#39; their way across the plain <br/>
&gt; When you&#39;re playin&#39; sixteen hours and you hardly seem to gain<br/>
&gt; And you don&#39;t feel much like campin&#39; but your eyes can&#39;t bear the strain <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here I am, crossing the Karanas again <br/>
&gt; There I am, the puppet of Fate<br/>
&gt; Here I go, ambushed by bandits again <br/>
&gt; There I go, Loading, Please Wait<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you run into an Inn just lookin&#39; to sell a bone<br/>
&gt; You can feel her fists upon you afore you can change your tone<br/>
&gt; and you hope she doesn&#39;t stun you, &#39;cause you really need to zone <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most times you can&#39;t see &#39;em cast, other times you can<br/>
&gt; But its still the same old result, be you a wood elf or a man <br/>
&gt; &#39;Cause you always seem encumbered, armed with an empty hand<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here I am, crossing the Karanas again <br/>
&gt; There I am, the puppet of Fate<br/>
&gt; Here I go, ambushed by bandits again <br/>
&gt; There I go, Loading, Please Wait<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Way up there in Highhold Pass, you&#39;re half a dozen zones away <br/>
&gt; And every plat you have, you offer desperately to pay<br/>
&gt; To get someone to Rez your body, else that Selo&#39;s must you play <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later in the evening, you still need to go to bed<br/>
&gt; While /shouts from kOOl DeWdS, are spinnin&#39; round in red<br/>
&gt; You examine the trip&#39;s last forage, forgetting why you&#39;re dead <br/>
