<br/>
I keep a blacklist as well. It&#39;s about the only way to protect yourself and <br/>
potentially get a chance at justice. When I was around L20, we set out to <br/>
camp the BBC for the warriors in the guild. This was quite a challenge for <br/>
us as most were inexperienced at dungeon tactics and the levels involved. So <br/>
we camped most of the day and along comes a guy who trains us all dead 4 <br/>
times in a row so he can take the BBC. He promptly auctions it right there <br/>
in the zone while we are waiting for help to get back to our bodies. I <br/>
remembered his name til many months and levels later, he joins a group I and <br/>
one of my warrior friends are in in L Guk. I promptly disbanded and walked, <br/>
the warrior right behind me. Frantic casters /tell us and we explain: we <br/>
will never group with this person knowingly. He has no honor and can not be <br/>
trusted. Word gets around about people and that makes it harder and harder <br/>
for them to find groups. One of our guild officers maintains a website for <br/>
just this purpose, list of bad and good people as well.<br/>
