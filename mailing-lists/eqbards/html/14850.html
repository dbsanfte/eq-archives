<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386243944"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; fun!  Bards are designed to be very valuable party members (and less so as a<br/>
&gt; powerful solo class.) So, the more fun you can have with people and partys,<br/>
&gt; the more you will enjoy your bard.  But it will take alot of time and an<br/>
&gt; enormous amount of dedication. And you will die, alot!  Hehe, so dont get<br/>
&gt; discouraged and dont pay too much attention to the problems of other people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My bard was fun to play up to L39.  After that the songs became less<br/>
  useful, and poorly designed.  Level 39 was also the level when you<br/>
  miss your first song, simply because they haven&#39;t created it yet.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not going to sugar coat it like Sylly did, because that&#39;s not<br/>
  how this game works.  The bard is incomplete, poorly tested, and<br/>
  very difficult to play in all situations.<br/>
<br/>
  Regardless of the lack of solo ability, your contribution will diminish<br/>
  as your level increases past L35.  You can roleplay and party all you<br/>
  want, but you can do that with any class or any character.<br/>
<br/>
  If you don&#39;t pay attention to &#39;problems&#39; of other people then you<br/>
  will not get sound advice on what it&#39;s like to be a bard.  I don&#39;t<br/>
  play any other character except my bard.  My druid twink is something<br/>
  I toy around with but don&#39;t take seriously.  I want Verant to make<br/>
  the bard more key to groups by giving them songs that exceed the <br/>
  use of purely mana or purely speed.  I love my bard, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
  play any other class if I had to start over.  But if you choose<br/>
  this road, it&#39;s long and very frustrating.  Regardless of whether<br/>
  you die a lot, you&#39;ll find as you begin to level is your songs <br/>
  don&#39;t really make you any more popular or necessary.  Our songs<br/>
  have a niche, but are easily outlived and surpassed by other <br/>
  spells from casters.<br/>
<br/>
  There may be a few naive bards out there who think they are gods<br/>
  at L50, or that they are perfect, but the high level bard is far<br/>
  from perfect.  I&#39;m not alone, other people share this opinion:<br/>
<br/>
  I love my bard, I&#39;m just confused and frustrating because my focus<br/>
  and scope drastically decreases over time.  My usefulness is limited<br/>
  and my songs/skills are often plagued by side effects and bugs.<br/>
