&gt; No, once again these songs aren&#39;t doing anything.  The state of these<br/>
&gt; songs has included:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cure messages but no cure.<br/>
&gt; Cure messages and a cure, but the cure dropped the resist until the song<br/>
&gt; pulsed again.<br/>
&gt; And now, no messages, no cure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s actually been like this for a little while now.  I posted on the QA<br/>
&gt; board, but no response.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Last night I was up in hate, with my regular song mix which includes<br/>
&gt; Psalm<br/>
&gt; &gt; of Purity and Psalm of Vitality.  I normally play these songs during<br/>
&gt; &gt; downtime to relieve the cleric of curing duties.  Up until last night, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would get a message...&quot;You have been cured of your affliction&quot; or<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; like that each time my song successfully pulsed against poison or<br/>
&gt; disease,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and after a few successful pulses the poison or disease would drop on<br/>
&gt; group<br/>
&gt; &gt; member Soandso.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well last night I never saw that message, and no group member ever was<br/>
&gt; cured<br/>
&gt; &gt; by my song.  I am just wondering if you guys have noticed the same<br/>
&gt; thing?<br/>
&gt; &gt; If any of you are in a position to quantitively test this over the<br/>
&gt; weekend,<br/>
&gt; &gt; please do so so we can get a bug report submitted ASAP if it is in fact<br/>
&gt; &gt; broken.  The possibility is also that my group was unresponsive to me,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is simply the success message which is broken.<br/>
