<b>Subject:</b> Experience penalty?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-163921597">I have seen messages talking about the experience hit that we get as bards.<br/>
Does anyone know what can of percentage we are talking about?  Also, how<br/>
much more do we incur if we are chose not to be a human?  In other words,<br/>
what are the percentage hits for the following:<br/>
   1) Human Bard<br/>
   2) Woodelf Bard<br/>
   3) Human Warrior - just as a comparison (I&#39;m assuming that this race and<br/>
class would incur no penalties.  So the other items (1 and 2) would be a<br/>
percentage increase form this race/class, i.e. A human Bard would require<br/>
XX% more experience to level when compared to a human warrior).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
