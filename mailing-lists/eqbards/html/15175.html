<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188841854">Ok here&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen of this song so far...<br/>
<br/>
1) Gives 10 STR<br/>
2) Gives 8 HP Regen per tick<br/>
3) Gives small rune against casters (haven&#39;t determined exact value yet,<br/>
must do more testing)<br/>
<br/>
Equipping lute doubles the strength and hit point regen effects (have not<br/>
tested rune capability with the lute yet).<br/>
<br/>
It does not stack with any of our damage shield songs, but it does stack<br/>
with VoV and CoB so now you can give 55 STR 30 AGI 15 DEX 8 HP Regen Attack<br/>
Speedup and a small rune when twisting during battle at level 50, not bad at<br/>
all!<br/>
<br/>
Better still, between battles if you really must be the healer at that<br/>
level, it stacks with Hymn of Restoration as well.<br/>
<br/>
Once I determine this rune thing I&#39;ll pass it along. Oh yeah, you can find<br/>
the song in Qeynos (where I bought it) and Kellethin (I heard it was here,<br/>
haven&#39;t looked for it there though)<br/>
