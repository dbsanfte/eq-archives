<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995358090"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I know what you&#39;re saying. I can&#39;t wait for this song myself. I am<br/>
&gt; dying ot jump through the holes in the ice in the frozen river in<br/>
&gt; Everfrost. But, alas, you cannot zone thorugh Ocean of Tears without<br/>
&gt; being on a boat. Can&#39;t even zone if you are on the little canoes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The canoes are even more buggy than the regular ships. It&#39;s really horrid. A<br/>
Bard friend of mine and I were taking a canoe from Erollisi to Sister Isles<br/>
and neither of us could see each other. I&#39;d constantly be checking my LOC<br/>
(he was navigating the boat) and I wasn&#39;t moving. Our LOC&#39;s wouldn&#39;t match<br/>
up (not even close). He&#39;d get to land and I&#39;d still see myself and the boat<br/>
out in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight. Then all the sudden,<br/>
*poof*. I&#39;m on land.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I asked if you could zone in/out of OOT while swimming is because<br/>
I know from personal experience that you can zone from the Oasis to South Ro<br/>
by swimming in the water. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You learn things from falling off of the boat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes you do. I learned how to swim rather well for one. I learned not to go<br/>
onto the lower deck of the boat for another.</div>
