If you can&#39;t design a bug-free interface where items don&#39;t drop through<br/>
inventory slots, you shouldn&#39;t be able to drop stuff on the screen.<br/>
Here are 2 solutions:<br/>
1. Make a &#39;drop item&#39; button right next to, or under, the destroy button.<br/>
And add an option in the General menu, same as &#39;fast destroy item&#39;.<br/>
That would probably take some programming, but would be well worth it.<br/>
2. Make it so you can&#39;t drop anything while the inventory is up on the<br/>
screen. OMG! how easy it that?<br/>
Can I get votes on who likes these ideas?<br/>

We are looking into implementing an option that would allow players to<br/>
configure an option that would present a confirmation box for the purpose<br/>
of dropping items. It&#39;s too soon for me to say for certain whether or not<br/>
we can implement something of that nature, but I should have some info soon.<br/>
