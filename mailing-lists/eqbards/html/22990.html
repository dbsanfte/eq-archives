<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Proposal to change how bard haste songs stack with enchanter/sham an haste spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262652907">I personally think our power is balanced with the other classes as the<br/>
game currently exists and any haste stacking would overpower the bard<br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
One of the flaws that I see in a lot of arguments for more powers is &#39;&#39;in literature<br/>
bards have...blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or &#39;&#39;in history, bards were....blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or my<br/>
favorite, &#39;&#39;in my vision bards should be able to do....blah blah blah, the designer<br/>
Verant&#39;s vision is obviously wrong&#39;&#39;.  While everquest can be said to be loosely based <br/>
on various fantasy sources, it is a separate entity and any direct comparisons to<br/>
external sources really aren&#39;t necessarily a compelling argument for or against anything.</div>
