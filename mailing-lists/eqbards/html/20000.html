<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-692191584">Well, yeah.  But how are they supposed to test any of the high level stuff with only GM-created high level<br/>
characters?  Isn&#39;t that shortcut one of the reasons they&#39;ve claimed that so many things were &quot;working&quot;<br/>
when in fact every normal player knew they were not?<br/>

&gt; day one that test is not a live server and be aware that your toon could<br/>
&gt; always be wiped.  Anyone playing on there agreed to that.  People are<br/>
&gt; supposed to be there to test the new patches, zones, items . . . what ever.<br/>
&gt;  Not to &quot;play&quot; like people on the live servers do.  Anyone on test should<br/>
&gt; have seen that it would one day come down to a p-wipe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In case some of you don&#39;t know, the entire player-base on the Test server<br/>
&gt; &gt;was wiped yesterday.  Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>
&gt; &gt;conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>
&gt; &gt;from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for those<br/>
&gt; &gt;that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character over<br/>
&gt; &gt;the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;heard.<br/>
