<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have not mem&#39;d Binding in about 10 levels.  Not very <br/>
useful, when I&#39;d rather AE sleep or Pixie Strike monsters.<br/>
If we are taking on a group of monsters I would rather<br/>
them all (save one) be sleep, than all of them attacking<br/>
me at a 25% or so reduced speed.  A quick pixie strike<br/>
against a few extra holds them long enough to deal with<br/>
later.  However, I would prefer group on one, and I always<br/>
shy away from group vs group confrontations.<br/>
<br/>
As for chains, and I&#39;m still touchy on this one, I think<br/>
that bards should chain for the first 3/4&#39;s of the monsters<br/>
life, then call for a snare just before the monster will turn.<br/>
The reduced heat with chains is VERY noticable, and allowing<br/>
lazy rangers/druids to snare in the beginning, so they dont<br/>
forget about it later, is poor tactics.<br/>
<br/>
The monsters that I fight now, hit for 60-80, and have thousands<br/>
of HP.  The battles don&#39;t go so quick, that chain + snare will<br/>
conflict.  In fact, I can chain about 6 times, before I call for<br/>
a snare (obviously more effective placeholding than my chains).<br/>
But the chains decrease the damage the party tanks are taking <br/>
dramatically.  Having a snare on a monster is utterly useless<br/>
until it decides to run.  This was my point in an earlier thread<br/>
which turned into a &#39;I hate snare&#39; conversation, which is just<br/>
not true.  Snare has a purpose, but chains do as well.  Don&#39;t<br/>
let a ranger/druid tell you to stop chains in early battle,<br/>
just so they can put a snare on the monster so they don&#39;t forget<br/>
later on.<br/>
