<div id="ygrps-yiv-899607750">Hmm, maybe that&#39;s why the alliance works out pretty well... PS has <br/>
always had a better than usual bard ratio with what, 3 out of 17-20 <br/>
of us?  We&#39;ve been able to do some pretty amazing things w/o the <br/>
alliance or enchanters ;)<br/>

&gt; Hey!  Actually their problem was they had too many great <br/>
enchanters, till<br/>
&gt; they all quit, lol.  So when I was in group with one of them my job <br/>
was to<br/>
&gt; support the chanter and help keep him alive.  Never had a chance to <br/>
do much<br/>
&gt; CC unless he died, which was not often.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; a bit.  I think that the general populace is probably pretty <br/>
&gt; ignorant about<br/>
&gt; &gt; what abilities bards do and do not have.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Halana, 59th Shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tani, 45th Bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; Solusek Ro<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You hit it right on the head Tani.  How many times do you hear <br/>
people <br/>
&gt; say, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know bards could do that!&quot;  I don&#39;t know about <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; all, but I hear that quite a bit.  And it doesn&#39;t surprise me that <br/>
&gt; usually, those are the people that say play mana song during the <br/>
&gt; fights!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which reminds me of a recent mana song story of mine... I was <br/>
playing <br/>
&gt; with a guild that we have an alliance with in Sebilis.  We did <br/>
&gt; Sebilis all weekend with pretty much the same group of people.  <br/>
Some <br/>
&gt; rotated, but all were in the same guild.  One night, we had 2-3 <br/>
&gt; clerics in the group at a given time.  One in particular was <br/>
telling <br/>
&gt; me to keep playing mana song when he would go OOM.  Now, I don&#39;t <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; about you guys, but when I have more than one cleric in the group <br/>
&gt; with one OOM and 2 frogs on us, I&#39;m not going to stop singing just <br/>
&gt; for mana song.  So he keeps going on about it and I just ignore <br/>
him, <br/>
&gt; then finally he says it in caps.  I immediatley say &quot;CHILL OUT!  <br/>
I&#39;M <br/>
&gt; SINGING WHAT I SHOULD BE!&quot;  I usually tell them to not worry about <br/>
&gt; what I&#39;m singing and I won&#39;t tell them how to play.  That usually <br/>
&gt; shuts them up ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The second day, the group decided that the 56 wiz would do better <br/>
&gt; crowd control with root than I could do.  So, I agree to try it <br/>
&gt; because I have never been to the Gang beetle room so don&#39;t know <br/>
what <br/>
&gt; to expect.  Well, needless to say, we failed that more than once <br/>
&gt; before I could explain that I could do a way better job after <br/>
&gt; noticing they are all blues.  After the weekend, I reflected back <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; realized that their guild no longer has a bard in it!  Rokenn was <br/>
&gt; their only high level bard until he switched servers!  It seemed to <br/>
&gt; me that they thought bards were only good for buffing resists and <br/>
&gt; mana.  Hey Rokenn!  You should&#39;ve done a better job at teaching <br/>
those <br/>
&gt; folks what we are all about, lol!  ;)  JK Rok. I guess I get the <br/>
fun <br/>
&gt; task of teaching them.  Or maybe Rokenn tried and they are just <br/>
&gt; hopeless, lol!  No, they are a great guild, but they just don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; understand a bard&#39;s power... just as Tani said.<br/>
