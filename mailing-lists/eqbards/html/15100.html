&gt; &gt;Wat was the plan for the lvl 24 see invis song?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Does anybody remember the discussion?  Is this just another useless song <br/>
&gt; &gt;that they are going to expect us to deal with...<br/>

&gt; &gt;I swear, when does NWN come out?<br/>

&gt; If you think the 24th lvl song is useless then you need to rethink your <br/>
&gt; position.  Otherwise you will find the pet users in your group will be <br/>
&gt; mightly PO&#39;d with you when you try to give them see invis.  Also the 24th <br/>
&gt; lvl song grants Ultravision, which is a big help to our night-blind human <br/>
&gt; friends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FYI Very few, if ANY of our songs are useless.  Some are just more <br/>
&gt; specialized then others.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. I think I used that song once in my entire Bardic career. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t bother complaining about it though, or they&#39;d probably replace<br/>
it with a new find true north song. Then they&#39;d probably fill in the<br/>
missing songs with find true east, find true west and find true south.<br/>
