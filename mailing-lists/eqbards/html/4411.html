<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078521739">I know it may sound silly.... but the dagger is about worth it. It&#39;s better<br/>
than most any Combine or Well Balanced Weapon. (someone did a ratio<br/>
comparison and the Dirk was better than all but the Combine or Well Balanced<br/>
2H if I remember). The Bonus Dex and Mag Resist are small, but extra<br/>
incentive to get one.<br/>
<br/>
They commonly go on my server, Bertox, for 20pp.<br/>
