&gt; Brilinnia Ban&#39;sidhe (currently playing unpack, paint, and hang curtains)<br/>
&gt; Excalibur, Xegony<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ooh!  Unpack, Paint, and Hang Curtains!  I&#39;ve played that!  Here was my<br/>
&gt; strategy:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Attack the paint first.  Twist Largo&#39;s Consonant Chain to ensure no drip<br/>
&gt; marks spawn.  Do NOT use Binding.  You do not want to reduce the AC of<br/>
&gt; paint, trust me.  Also twist Vilia&#39;s Chorus of Celerity and Jig O&#39; Vigor<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; ensure all the paint is dealt with before boxes or curtains start to<br/>
spawn.<br/>
&gt; I did this wielding a brush in my primary and can in my off-hand.  This<br/>
&gt; meant occasionally twisting Aria of Eagles in order to secure the zone.<br/>
&gt; But if you can afford it, go to Greater Fay and buy a two-handed,<br/>
&gt; rechargeable, extended handle paint applicator.  It&#39;s more reliable than<br/>
&gt; the Aria and will allow you to twist Lyssa&#39;s Solidarity of Vision as<br/>
needed<br/>
&gt; if any of your group members go out looking for boxes too soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next attack the curtains.  Some would argue boxes should be dealt with<br/>
&gt; next, but I&#39;ve found that by the time you&#39;ve attacked all the curtains in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; particular zone you invariably find more paint spawn points that you<br/>
missed<br/>
&gt; the first time.  And you want all the paint out of the way before you<br/>
&gt; tackle the boxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For curtains, use Aria of Eagles, Psalm of Cooling (Curtains have pets<br/>
&gt; called Drafts which are very low-level but can make attacking the curtains<br/>
&gt; an aggravating experience), and Celerity.   It is rumored that the level<br/>
49<br/>
&gt; song was to be Fufil&#39;s Curtaining Chant, but that Verant didn&#39;t feel bards<br/>
&gt; should be allowed to corner the market on Interior Decorating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lastly, attack the boxes.  Break the spawns carefully.  An uncontrolled<br/>
&gt; train of boxes is a very, very scary thing.  And they have a remarkable<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; of blocking the exits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If all goes well with the boxes, you should be able to control the zone<br/>
&gt; using Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto, Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion, and<br/>
Verses<br/>
&gt; of Celerity.  (Due to the need to frequently jump or climb over boxes, the<br/>
&gt; agility buff of VoC makes it a better choice than the pure haste effect of<br/>
&gt; CoC)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the boxes begin spawning uncontrollably, immediately stop your haste<br/>
&gt; song.  Twist instead Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric, Cataloging Libretto, and<br/>
&gt; Solidarity of Vision.  (It is believed Lyssa did most of her composing<br/>
&gt; while attacking boxes).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When all the boxes are dealt with, sing Cantana of Replenishment.  Your<br/>
&gt; party will appreciate it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Safe travels,<br/>
