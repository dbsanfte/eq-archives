<br/>
a) there is no known recipe for a Buryani Bundt Cake, although I&#39;ve heard<br/>
rumors that they can be foraged in Frontier Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
b) I saw no ovens in the mines of Nurga or the Temple of Droga, I think that<br/>
the oven will be a container that requires the recipe and the bake to be put<br/>
in it and combined.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] New quest in Firiona Vie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all.  I&#39;m in the midst of trying to do a new quest that has been<br/>
found in Firiona Vie.  I was hoping that someone here could give me<br/>
some help.<br/>
<br/>
If you hail Glinya Sweetpie (she sells baking items and food/water)<br/>
she mentions someone named Treekill.  If you ask her about him, she<br/>
says something to the effect of he&#39;s been tring to court her and she<br/>
told him to bring her a Burynai Bunt Cake to put him off.  Asking her<br/>
about the Bunt Cake, she says that there&#39;s no such thing.<br/>
<br/>
There is a wandering guard named Scout Treekill.  If you hail him, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t say anything, but the text mentions a helm hanging from his<br/>
belt.  If you ask him about the helm, he says that he took it from a<br/>
bard he had to beat up because he was singing Drow songs.  (This has<br/>
been mentioned on this list, I believe)  Asking him about Glinya<br/>
Sweetpie, He says that he&#39;s courting her and that she had asked him to<br/>
bring her the bunt cake.  Asking him about the bunt cake gives you<br/>
this text (from my screenshot):<br/>
<br/>
Scout Treekill gets excited.  What?!! Do you know how to bake a<br/>
Burynai Bunt Cake.  Glinya said she would marry me if I baked one!!<br/>
She won&#39;t let me use her oven so I had to search for one.  I finally<br/>
located one in some goblin mine, but I can&#39;t find the recipe or bake.<br/>
Please!! I would give you this bards helm for a Burynai Bunt Cake.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I have deduced from this passage.  The Bunt Cake requires<br/>
the baking skill.  There is an oven in the Mines of Droga where it<br/>
must be baked.  Now, I am not a baker, so I&#39;m asking here if anyone<br/>
might know the recipe for this?  Is there anyone else who might be<br/>
working on this that can give me any leads?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys.<br/>
