<div id="ygrps-yiv-514962569">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been so long that I&#39;m not sure how accurate this is, but since I was a <br/>
hardcore solo bard, here&#39;s what I can remember:<br/>
<br/>
Level 20-23 (not exactly sure) Gargoyles in Ocean of Tears<br/>
Level 27 - Cyclopses in Rathe Mtns<br/>
Level 30 - Hill Giants in Rathe Mtns<br/>
Level 35 - Bloodgills in Lake of Ill Omen (best to have a tambourine by <br/>
this time and a fishbone earring)<br/>
<br/>
Gargoyles in OOT<br/>
I was able to use all instrument combo to bring it down pretty low (Chords <br/>
of Dissonance, Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord, Hymn of Restoration - swap brass <br/>
and lute appropriately) and when it got me too low, I would bellow kite <br/>
using 2 bellows and accelerando. This was pretty hard, so I would only <br/>
recommend this for someone who is a great kiter.<br/>
<br/>

PS. I&#39;ve pretty much stopped playing EQ as post 51 is really not much fun. <br/>
Been playing DAOC and believe me, as a Hibernian Bard you can always find a <br/>
group (I mean, heck, we can ressurect after level 10!).<br/>

&gt; &gt; So, what, I join the list and you all get quiet?  I&#39;m only 11, my<br/>
&gt; &gt; reputation cannot have preceded me as yet.  I&#39;ve been soloing in NK<br/>
&gt; &gt; since 9, my first bard.  Any words of wisdom on where to go next?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What&#39;d be really great would be if a couple of real pros would list<br/>
&gt;where they soloed for each level(s) on their way up, like &quot;from 12-16<br/>
&gt;I killed monsters in zone X through melee, then up to 20 I kited Pink<br/>
&gt;Volvo Demons who conned yellow, then...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve actually started my own list just to find out where to solo<br/>
&gt;at &quot;higher&quot; levels (people try to say you should give it up after<br/>
&gt;about 12th, but I prefer solo)...Soloing Everquest,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to post what I know about soloing, and data I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;accumulating, like lists of soloable MObs (monsters) for each level,<br/>
&gt;tricks for soloing better (how to automatically raise your sense<br/>
&gt;direction, forage, mend, and other skills as fast as possible, no<br/>
&gt;button-clicking required), and other stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My hope is that both people with questions and people with advice<br/>
&gt;will join the list and post, and we can get a really good<br/>
&gt;infosite/faq going after a while.<br/>
