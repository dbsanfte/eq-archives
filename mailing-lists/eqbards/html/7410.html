<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-341686952">This is why I am weary of this subject. Your assumption below is based on the<br/>
premise that a petition could be considered &quot;well thought out and logical&quot; by<br/>
everyone. People that are against any changes in the bind policy will never see<br/>
any petition as &quot;well thought out and logical&quot;. People that are for changes in<br/>
the bind policy will see almost every petition as &quot;well thought out and<br/>
logical&quot;. It&#39;s a lose-lose proposition. Neither side is going to convince the<br/>
other and I think we CAN assume that Verant is aware that a large number of<br/>
people ARE unhappy with the current bind policy, although as you&#39;ve probably<br/>
figured out I am not one of them. And so yes I would vote NO on a petition that<br/>
was in favor of binding for all classes or for current binders to be able to<br/>
bind anyone anywhere.<br/>

P.S. That being said there is one sort of petition I would be in favor of:<br/>
limiting the current casters of bind to being able to bind themselves in city<br/>
zones just like anyone else.<br/>

&gt; One last question for those of you who are opposed to changing the binding<br/>
&gt; policy.  Lets assume that someone creates a petition on this issue that is<br/>
&gt; well thought out and makes logical sense.  If any petition on binding has a<br/>
&gt; chance of getting approved, this one is it.  If you agree with me that there<br/>
&gt; is a possibility, however small, that Verant will change their minds on the<br/>
&gt; binding issue, would you vote in favor or against the petition?  Remember<br/>
&gt; that if the petition is disapproved, the policy remains the same, the way<br/>
&gt; you think it should be.  But if the petition is approved and the binding<br/>
&gt; policy is changed, a LOT of people will be happy plus you will also benefit<br/>
&gt; from the change.  IMO, if you vote Yes for the petition its a win-win<br/>
&gt; situation for you.<br/>
