I went and read JC&#39;s bard guide after i heard about it here.  Could he have<br/>
been a little more inaccurate?  My personal guess is that (if he played one at<br/>
all) he played it up to maybe level 7.  Some of my friends and i have exchanged<br/>
e-mail with JC before, and he has consistently been misinformed, wrong, etc on<br/>
many issues, and refused to accept any evidence to the contrary.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
even know what Lullaby does!  That&#39;s just amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i had posted on friday asking if anyone knew where the Runed Lava<br/>
Pendant was dropped.....i found out....after obligatory spoiler space.<br/>

The Runed Lava Pendant is (a very good item for bards) AC5, +6STR, +5 Fire<br/>
Resist.  I cannot confirm, but it is dropped in Sol A, off of the Lava<br/>
Elemental.<br/>

Still looking for info on the Granite Bracer.....<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
