<div id="ygrps-yiv-352632294">I hear that the feature for a mob not returning was put in to stop Necro<br/>
dot/fearing or pet/fearing or something like that, such that the necro fears<br/>
and doesn&#39;t follow the mob.<br/>
	This might then give sense to that high level song that is a target mob<br/>
move speed increase and fear. Just hope it doesn&#39;t pass anything on the way<br/>
out. :)<br/>

	Good Journey<br/>

In Kunark if you use AE Fear you can actually fear the mobs so far away that<br/>
they don&#39;t come back.  FUN method of crowd control if a pull gets out of<br/>
hand.  Snare what you&#39;re fighting then fire off Fear.  Everything else runs<br/>
away at mach speed and usually doesn&#39;t come back because it runs outside<br/>
it&#39;s chase radius.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t used it much because I&#39;m waiting word from a GM on whether it&#39;s<br/>
legal (I suspect he&#39;ll say it&#39;s fine as long as you don&#39;t relog to clear the<br/>
hate list.  Could be an awesome tool for zoneline fighting though ;)<br/>
