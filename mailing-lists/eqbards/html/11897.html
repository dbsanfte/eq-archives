<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182561371"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  My first idea for PoF was... send me in full buffs, full everything.<br/>
&gt;  Reso, Rune IV, Camo, Invis Animals, Invis Undead, Invis, +AGI, +DEX<br/>
&gt;  +STR, +STA, Talisman, Guard, buffs buffs buffs buffs.....  Nekkid<br/>
&gt;  me, with a normal drum, and selo&#39;s memmed, and I haul ass.  Hit the<br/>
&gt;  ground running, and collect all the mobs and train them away from <br/>
&gt;  the portal, away from the SE corner, into the middle of nowhere then<br/>
&gt;  curl up and die.  Immediately following that let everyone zone in<br/>
&gt;  however they wanted to.  (I&#39;ll leave breaking the plane discussion<br/>
&gt;  out)  Since I wasn&#39;t L50, that idea was dismissed as bullshit.  To<br/>
&gt;  this day, I think that sacrifice would still work.  The main problem<br/>
&gt;  you have upon zoning is a shiverback or scarling sitting there <br/>
&gt;  pounding the crap out of you, and then your client gives you control.<br/>
&gt;  By that time you are dead.  Loading, please wait... to another Loading,<br/>
&gt;  please wait.  If a bard could clear that garbage, and avoid a DT<br/>
&gt;  from Cazic, I think the portal trash would stay clear long enough<br/>
&gt;  for players to zone in.  This is purely hypothetical as no one <br/>
&gt;  wanted to listen to little me.  8)   As for pulling, I wish. hehe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the training stuff away from the zone line doesnt work,<br/>
matter of fact, it seems to have the opposite effect. Quite a few people on<br/>
tunare had the same idea and yeah, i got picked for train duty. I was quite<br/>
happy to do it though if it ment an easier breakin for everybody else. I<br/>
basically did everything you suggested except i had no invis (the idea was<br/>
to attract attention, not avoid it) and the end results where disastrous. I<br/>
tried doing several patterns, sometimes running in circls around the gate<br/>
hill and then running far off, othertimes just tagging the stuff inbetween<br/>
the corner and the impt tower... etc. All of em resulted in the same thing,<br/>
one full zone of uber pissed mobs looking for something to kill. It just<br/>
made a big backlash that fell back with a mighty THWACK on anybody that<br/>
tried to zone it or was in the corner. I lived plenty long enough to get<br/>
stuff far away, matter of fact i made it to cazic himself all but once<br/>
(tried punching him but everytime i got close he dt&#39;d me heh). Several<br/>
other people tried this including big ogre warriors, troll sk&#39;s etc. End<br/>
result was all the same, just stirred everything up with out sufficiently<br/>
clearing the corner/gate hill. I have a tutorial for safely entering the<br/>
PoF at<br/>

pic, basically just a bunch of common sense.  My bard and necro both have a<br/>
flawless zone in record to the pof, and the bard got his full suit of<br/>
imbrued before verant moved it to scorn banshees in the PoH. <br/>
<br/>
I wish the train method worked, and i am not completly ruling it out, if<br/>
you can figure out a way of making it work please SHARE =)<br/>
