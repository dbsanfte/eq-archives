<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203222614"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Assuming they get future additional funding, when is Horizons scheduled for<br/>
&gt;release?  Based on what I read, if they don&#39;t get the funding the project<br/>
&gt;will fall through, which will be a shame based on the promise of this game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The funding issue is solved.  They plan to go to Beta early 2001.  They are<br/>
currently planning on a 1 year Beta with 4 phases.  From what Doug and David<br/>
have relayed recently they received more funding offers than they felt<br/>
comfortable accepting.  My only fear is that they are planning on so much<br/>
content that it may become a daunting task to avoid scope creep.<br/>
