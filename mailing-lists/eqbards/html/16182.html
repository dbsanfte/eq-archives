<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685016185">1.	Ok, there are 2 ways.  First: get invis to undead.  Take left side<br/>
tunnel to vampire bat room.  Then take tunnel on left but inside that tunnel<br/>
*hug the right wall* (greater ice bone skels will agro on you if you don&#39;t -<br/>
they see thru all invis).  Past the GIBS, you get to the bridge to the<br/>
tower.  Cross and go towards rear.  Look for the 2nd ladder you see (off to<br/>
the one side iirc).  The assasin/Supplier room is up that 2nd ladder.<br/>
Second way if the BR is camped hard and all the deadly black widows are<br/>
dead, take the right tunnel and from the vampire bat room go right thru the<br/>
bugs - longer way but no GIBS (only bugs heh).  It eventually pops out on<br/>
the side of the bridge to the tower.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Prolly 35 to 45. The named&#39;s are tough.  Mean back stabs - keep your<br/>
back to the wall at all times.<br/>
<br/>
3.	Go at popular times to get the feel for the area and have lower<br/>
risk.  Then go back at slower times to try to get a group.  I think the mask<br/>
is regarded as a class specific novelty these days - since its bard rogue<br/>
only.  You may be able to get loot rights just by asking and waiting.  Oh<br/>
yeah waiting.  Welcome to EverCamp.  2 hour spawn time iirc? <br/>
<br/>
Heh, I have not been to Guk in a month or more.  Guess I need to go back.<br/>

<br/>
So here are my humble questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) I can get to the bedroom (who can&#39;t) but I don&#39;t know the exact way to<br/>
the assassin&#39;s room. How do I get to the room? I have several maps, but they<br/>
are all a bit sketchy in the assasin area, and I&#39;ve heard there are ladders<br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
2) Does anyone know what level group usually camps the room, or what the<br/>
common loot practices are? (eg. if I go for the mask, will I be excluded<br/>
from the other loot since I can use the mask, or is it not even counted<br/>
since it&#39;s no drop) It&#39;s not that I care, I&#39;ll go either way, I&#39;m just<br/>
curious.<br/>
<br/>
3) Is there anything in particular I need to watch out for?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
