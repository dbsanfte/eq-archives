<div id="ygrps-yiv-826009267">I often help people find their corpse willingly, without asking for a price, and almost everytime the player has offered compensation that was good for me (once it was just a flask of water.)  I like doing it, but at the same time, you can&#39;t help but feel a bit used.  What other class is known as the &quot;hey, I need something, go find a &lt;insert class here&gt;&quot;  None except for the bard.  The one exception may be binding, which as said before, takes a few minutes at most, including meditate time.  I must give my thanks out to other players who play selflessly as I do, as a number of times I have tried to attack an enemy that perhaps I shouldn&#39;t (we all get exp hungry), and a pc who is weaker than I still takes the time, unasked, to heal me from a distance and stay with me the whole battle.  These players make me feel better about being a &quot;used&quot; bard.  It&#39;s the ones that you see stand next to the monster your fighting, waiting for you to die so they can capitalize on the weakened beast and your failure, only to hear them ask you to find their corpse later.  ...that&#39;ll be 1pp plus a piece of armor...heh<br/>

&gt; &gt;I was wondering if anyone else has set a standard for corpse relocations.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I usually charge 5 GP minimum for up to level 5, plus 1 GP/2 levels rounded<br/>
&gt; &gt;up.  This is standard, plus I usually ask for tips or danger pay.    Does<br/>
&gt; &gt;this sound like too little?  Maybe it should be 1 PP/2 levels after level<br/>
&gt; &gt;10?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Personally I only ask for aid in returning to a safe city if it takes me<br/>
&gt; where I do not feel I can&#39;t get safely back from. I tend not to charge for<br/>
&gt; serves especially to inexperienced people. This is do to a personal creed of<br/>
&gt; service to aid my fellow travelers.<br/>
&gt;     I also have served as mediator to merchants for those handicapped by<br/>
&gt; race prejudice. For it is hard when you can not even get a simple loaf of<br/>
&gt; bread, and you are not in a friendly town. The chances of getting home<br/>
&gt; diminish for lack of a simple necessity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     But it is not wrong to charge as well, a bard must eat... No matter how<br/>
&gt; it is done, as long as it is not though unfair practice that I will balk at.<br/>
&gt; Then again, unfair is a reltive term, left for each to decide on...<br/>
