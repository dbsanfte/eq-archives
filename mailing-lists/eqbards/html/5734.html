<div id="ygrps-yiv-558390869">I have been in cazicthule for the last three days, and have tested<br/>
out a majority of the songs I have but never really used a lot.<br/>
<br/>
* The Tae Diviner can charm people, and he usually does.<br/>
  If your party identifies which player is whacking them,<br/>
  charm them right back to your side and make them attack<br/>
  the Tae.  They are much more efficient under charm control,<br/>
  than they would be otherwise.  If they seem to break charm<br/>
  too quickly, drag them in a room, and tell them to sit.<br/>
<br/>
* AE fear (Screech) - all I can say is &#39;wow&#39;.  I can disperse<br/>
  a 10 lizard train at the zoneline in 2 seconds.  While being<br/>
  swarmed in 4C, this song let me escape into the maze and back<br/>
  to the courtyard.  4 mob limits do not apply &#39;outdoors&#39; and<br/>
  cazicthule is considered outdoors.  My screen scrolled really<br/>
  bad with &#39;... flees in terror&#39; as a horde of lizards ran off.<br/>
<br/>
* Lullaby.  I stopped using this song at level 16 when the novelity<br/>
  wore off.  Everytime I&#39;d play it, I would usually die.  Parties<br/>
  don&#39;t understand how dangerous this song can be to the bard.<br/>
  But now I mem&#39;d it back in my song lineup, and at my level with<br/>
  a lute, jeez, I can put things to sleep instantly with very little<br/>
  resists.  Same as Screech in that I can nod off as many lizards <br/>
  that decide to show up, think I did 8 at once last night.<br/>
<br/>
* Pixie Strike.  Although difficult to track many mobs with this,<br/>
  it works very good at balancing a fight when the odds look bad.<br/>
  You must pull yourself out of weaving and combat, to click and<br/>
  mez, over and over across multiple mobs - but it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
  As for blocking casters with this, you either have to be lucky<br/>
  or continue to strike them over and over.  If you see a judicator<br/>
  healing and you press your pixie button, you will almost never<br/>
  catch the lizard in time.  You will _never_ catch smites, they<br/>
  are too quick, and you probably wont ever catch wrath.  Twitching<br/>
  the button on a visual spell cue means you are too late.  Almost<br/>
  need to cycle pixie on one target to keep it in check.<br/>
<br/>
* Charm bugs:  I have been playing with charm a lot recently.<br/>
  And I have found a lot of bugs with it.  Deadly bugs.<br/>
<br/>
  Mage and pet are attacking a monster, and I charm it.  Sometimes<br/>
  the pet STILL has the monster on it&#39;s attack list and decides<br/>
  to attack ME the master of the monster.  I was beaten up very<br/>
  bad by a magician&#39;s own pet last night in cazicthule.<br/>
<br/>
  Party is fighting a monster, and another shows up and I charm<br/>
  the new monster.  One party member turns to attack the new monster<br/>
  after charm wears off to &#39;pull it off me&#39; - but I charm it again.<br/>
  The monster now has the player who attacked it STILL in it&#39;s agro<br/>
  list.  And without me saying, /pet back off - the monster will <br/>
  continue to beat down that player.  In fact if I tell the pet<br/>
  to guard me, it will start right back up and attack my own party<br/>
  members.<br/>
<br/>
  I will /log as much of this as I can tonight, and try to make sense<br/>
  of it all.<br/>
<br/>
  One more bubble til this hell ends...<br/>
