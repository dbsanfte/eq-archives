&gt; To me, anything over 20 *is* the later levels. If I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like a class by that point, I&#39;m outta there. It<br/>
&gt; takes the average player a long time to get to 20 or<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The nature of the game changes as you gain levels.  I don&#39;t<br/>
believe it&#39;s entirely due to (malicious) intent by Verant<br/>
either - stuff like class balance in a level-based game isn&#39;t<br/>
the easiest thing to anticipate at the design or even beta<br/>
phase.  You can rant and rave all you like about how much you<br/>
hate it, but it will probably always be there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to spend months unhappy.  If you don&#39;t like it,<br/>
don&#39;t do it.  I agree it&#39;s unfortunate that they didn&#39;t list<br/>
out all the strengths and weaknesses of the classes at<br/>
different levels in the manual, but I honestly believe even<br/>
Verant didn&#39;t really know what these strengths and weaknesses<br/>
would be in the final release version of the game.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, let me rephrase what I said:  Having a well balanced group<br/>
becomes more important at later levels.  I wasn&#39;t telling you<br/>
to wait because it&#39;ll get better.  I was simply saying that<br/>
casters may seem to be the best class to play at lower levels,<br/>
but at high levels it&#39;s important to have a tank or four, to<br/>
enlighten you to a potential mistake you could be making now<br/>
because level-based systems suck.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; change in the 30s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally speaking, I&#39;ll have given up my bard long<br/>
&gt; before I ever come close to that level. It&#39;s already<br/>
&gt; starting to lose it&#39;s luster to me at 18. I keep,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you and your friends are never going to reach the 30s, then<br/>
there&#39;s no point to planning that far ahead.  You will do fine<br/>
playing (mostly) casters.  I don&#39;t see Verant fixing the<br/>
caster/melee imbalance at low levels; if anything they&#39;ve<br/>
actually made it worse since release.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that? All the other players I play have bind. If I<br/>
&gt; remember correctly, wasn&#39;t it you John that said (awhile<br/>
&gt; ago on this list) that if you started over you&#39;d never<br/>
&gt; play a non-binding class again?   (grin)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wasn&#39;t me.  I honestly don&#39;t care about binding except when<br/>
that stupid boat trip is involved.  I&#39;ve played in the Karanas<br/>
while bound in Freeport.  I&#39;ve played in Cazic bound in Halas.<br/>
Heck, a lot of times I don&#39;t even remember where I&#39;m bound.<br/>
The bard is the non-binder *least* affected by this issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; impressed. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve never used<br/>
&gt; them before. *shrug* But that combined with not being<br/>
&gt; able to bind make the class that less interesting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously being able to bind is of paramount importance to<br/>
you, while it isn&#39;t to others.  Either play classes who can<br/>
bind, or complain to Verant about it.  While the discussion<br/>
here has been stimulating, it&#39;s all pointless if Verant never<br/>
sees it.  There&#39;s not much to gain arguing it with us.<br/>
