Mask of Deception, Nektulos, and Lavastorm<br/>

<br/>
Of course, I didn&#39;t pay attention when everyone was talking about the mask a <br/>
little while ago, didn&#39;t think I&#39;d need it for a long time. If you could <br/>
answer a few questions I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
My group wants to go to Lavastorm, does this mask get me through Nektulos <br/>
unscathed? Can I sell in Neriak wearing it? We&#39;re all good races so there is <br/>
some concern about Nektulos and selling loot.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is bard / rogue only, and supposedly a common drop in L Guk, I <br/>
assume that it is just left on the mob pretty often now (on my server it&#39;s <br/>
almost always garbage). Because of this, I don&#39;t feel that it is horrible <br/>
twinking if a guildmate kills the mob for me (ok, a little twinking). BUT, I <br/>
have to go pick it up because it&#39;s no drop, right? Any advice on how a lvl <br/>
12 bard can get in and out of L Guk, looting the mob?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
