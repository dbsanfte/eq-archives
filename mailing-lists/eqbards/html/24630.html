yeah, Chorus of Clarity stacks with CoReplenishment, the casters gasp at the<br/>
mana regen. Only CoR has the icon, so it&#39;ll drop after you leave it on for 2<br/>
pulses for some reason. Fflewdeur was explaining to me when I first got it,<br/>
I didn&#39;t understand fully, I just nodded and complied lol :)<br/>
But during battle, i prefer to go with Cantana and something else, any other<br/>
2, not Chorus of Clarity.  sometimes I&#39;m in the mood for Niv&#39;s and a haste<br/>
or other atk song to keep everyone quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Tank 1 = can i get haste?<br/>
Rogue 1 = Can i get str?<br/>
Caster1, 2 & 3 = oom!<br/>
<br/>
Bard = Coming, shush it! :)</div>
