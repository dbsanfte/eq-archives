<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422475571">he heh, unless they&#39;re calling it and seeding it every time it gets called.<br/>
This should only produce a sequence that would repeat if they use time and<br/>
connection delays in the seeding.  Since high lag seems to affect bad random<br/>
numbers though, it might really be true they are using connection return<br/>
delay as part of the seed.  An ugly thought, but not out of the realms of<br/>
possibility from what we&#39;ve seen from Verant.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me at<br/>
all if some coder thought it was really &#39;neat&#39; that the random number seed<br/>
was based on the connection response time.  High ping wouldn&#39;t always mean<br/>
bad, but it would mean people would use the same seed a lot as most peoples<br/>
ping values tend to stay in the same ranges.<br/>

&gt; On a second but maybe related note, I believe the random number genrator<br/>
&gt; may be flawed in the game.  I see too many long runs of unlikly events<br/>
&gt; (both good and bad).  This would be far from unheard of, as random<br/>
&gt; number generators are eseentially impossible to code.  (People just<br/>
&gt; write code that approximates random number generartion).  I did a study<br/>
&gt; of the random number generator built into the 8088 (basically the<br/>
&gt; original IBM PC) processor.  (I used a few different languages to try to<br/>
&gt; eliminate any effect they had on it).  I basically graphed a &quot;random&quot; x<br/>
&gt; and y cooordinate, drawing a line from point 1 to 2 to 3, etc...  The<br/>
&gt; plots always followed similar patterns... Weird, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Really good random number generators are notoriously difficult<br/>
to write.  However, you have to keep in mind that unless<br/>
they&#39;re saving seeds for every event sequence (e.g. whether<br/>
your weapon procs, which mob spawns at a site), your<br/>
&quot;sequence&quot; of random number events is not a really a sequence.  <br/>
It&#39;s pieces of the actual sequence, the other random numbers<br/>
having gone to determining if the mob hit your tank, whether<br/>
your caster friend&#39;s spell fizzled, whether the guy meditating<br/>
at the other end of the zone &quot;passed&quot; his skill check, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The order of these events are pretty much random, depending on<br/>
player input, Internet lag, etc.  So even if the random<br/>
numbers are only quasi-random, *which* quasi-random number you<br/>
get *is* random.  So I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to blame the RNG<br/>
just because you get a few unusual strings of sequences.<br/>
