<b>Subject:</b> Sainy&#39;s Singing Blade and Claw <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919758572">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone has any info on these items.<br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere that the Singing Blade came from the Temple of Droga. My<br/>
group took the temple for the last 3 days and we didn&#39;t see any even<br/>
remotely interesting mobs, just a large variety of goblins. (Stalagknights,<br/>
Dirtcallers, Slinkers, Rockchanters, Whipcrackers, Firedrowsers etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Do named mobs exist in this dungeon? If so, I would expect them to spawn in<br/>
a specifc area and wander a bit.<br/>
<br/>
The claw I have no info on.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated as I&#39;ve almost given on my EBWs. :┬¼ (<br/>
