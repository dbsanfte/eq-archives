<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114964795">I love the idea, in theory and in a role-playing sense.<br/>
But in reality, personally I hate research.  My other character is a level<br/>
40 necromancer.  I&#39;ve heard a couple of clerics and druids complain that<br/>
they don&#39;t get to research, and I just have to laugh.<br/>
<br/>
* I&#39;ve traded -very- good items to get my hands on a research component<br/>
(words for necromancers). . . and that is just to have the opportunity to<br/>
research it.  I&#39;m not guaranteed anything.<br/>
<br/>
* I have four backpacks full of words in the bank.  That&#39;s 50% of my bank<br/>
storage.<br/>
<br/>
* I pay my guildmaster to raise my research skill (for me, the stakes are<br/>
too high to practice with high level words) and at level 40 it costs me 20pp<br/>
per skill point (and it is only going to get worse).<br/>
<br/>
* Higher level words are rare, my necromancer is almost 41 and doesn&#39;t have<br/>
his 39 pet yet . . . and he auctions many many times daily for the one word<br/>
he is missing.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think it would be fun if they made it a detailed quest<br/>
to get some of our songs.  Maybe something along the lines of visiting every<br/>
mail delivery bard to pick up a piece, and then we run to Nagafen&#39;s Lair,<br/>
sing Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon to Nagafen.  And hope we can turn in the<br/>
pieces before he eats us. ;)<br/>

&gt;My fellow coworkers and I were standing around talking EQ (which we<br/>
&gt;unfortunately do too often) and the subject of research came up.  (My boss<br/>
&gt;is a wizard)  I thought to myself wouldn&#39;t that be great, to be able to<br/>
&gt;research new songs.  Well, then I thought to myself, that isnt really<br/>
&gt;practical because no one would &quot;research&quot; a song.  But then I thought<br/>
&gt;wouldnt it be even better if we bards could do our own form of research in<br/>
&gt;songwriting.  Of course we couldnt just write a song a then be done.  What<br/>
&gt;if we could do musical research and put components together to make new<br/>
&gt;songs.  After all, wouldn&#39;t real bards write their own songs?  What do you<br/>
&gt;think? </span></blockquote></div>
