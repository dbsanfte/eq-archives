&gt; I recently had a fight about this so can anyone please tell me if a lvl 5<br/>
&gt; bard is usefull in a group that contains lvl 5 to lvl 7 characters and if<br/>
&gt; not when is it usefull.<br/>
<br/>

At L5, I&#39;d say a bard is about as much use as anyone in said party.<br/>
Possibly more useful. I don&#39;t think any melee&#39;r is particularly great at<br/>
that level, and the bard can play the L1 song which should marginally<br/>
improve everyone&#39;s melee. As well, if it&#39;s safe enough, you could play<br/>
CoD and do a bit of damage that way as well. That said, why bother<br/>
grouping at 5? You can still get decent exp from firebeetles I think, or<br/>
spiderlings for sure. (freeport/misty thicket area).<br/>
<br/>
Once the bard hit&#39;s 6, there&#39;s no question they are a great addition to<br/>
a group.<br/>
