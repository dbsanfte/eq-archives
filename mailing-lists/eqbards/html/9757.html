<div id="ygrps-yiv-152669407">That&#39;s just nasty.  I&#39;ve been in the Throne Room for two levels now and<br/>
routinely shout &quot;Mudwater Rune in TR&quot; to the zone.  To date I&#39;ve seen two of<br/>
them picked up by bards that couldn&#39;t safely group in Cazic-Thule.<br/>

&gt; When I was in Cazic Thule the other day I was waiting on my group<br/>
&gt; to get there. I went over near the<br/>
&gt; Gorilla spawn because that&#39;s where I was going to hunt with my group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There was another group there and I role-played asking them if I<br/>
&gt; could loot a mudwater Rune from a<br/>
&gt; Fanatic if that got one as I needed it to complete a quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They rudely said no only if you pay us 100PP for loot rights. I<br/>
&gt; politely left the area and said<br/>
&gt; thank you but that was to high.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know the argument of &quot;there killing it, it&#39;s there loot.&quot; but<br/>
&gt; if you don&#39;t need it don&#39;t loot it.<br/>
&gt; Or charge a reasonable price to loot it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was it going to kill them to help someone out?<br/>
