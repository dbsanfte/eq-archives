<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545834662"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Last night a high level wizard starting offering me a ton of mithril stuff<br/>
&gt; in trade for my lambent.  Having never seen a piece of mithril before in my<br/>
&gt; life, I haven&#39;t the slightest whether or not this is a good trade or not.<br/>
&gt; Anyone got any advice on the break down between mithril and lambent?  He was<br/>
&gt; offering multiple mithril pieces per one lambent piece.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s easier for him to camp for the Mith BP, or the Mith Bracer<br/>
  than it is for wasting his time, so to speak on camping items<br/>
  which may or may not drop for quest armor.  In this way laziness<br/>
  pays off for the dilligent bard.  The wizard no doubt has a L5<br/>
  bard he&#39;s ready to twink up.  Everyone wants to play a bard now,<br/>
  it seems.  Same thing is happening on Innoruuk, lots of Lambent<br/>
  buyers who have twinks.<br/>
