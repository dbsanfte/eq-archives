<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573622237">*Optional Patch*<br/>
<br/>
A new zone, The Temple of Solusek Ro, is now available via the optional<br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
*General Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
- Experience and looting rights are now awarded for group aggregate<br/>
damage. This is now true for ALL servers. We still consider this change in<br/>
&#39;TEST&#39; and will conduct a poll as to whether it positively addresses the<br/>
kill stealing situation in approximately 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
[ Great!  Being the class which dishes out the least damage over time of<br/>
any class in the game (at least until level 48), I cannot begin to tell<br/>
you how aggravating the old system was. ]<br/>
<br/>
- As mentioned on Saturday, Rubicite armor will no longer spawn. The new<br/>
class specific quests to obtain the new armor are now in for each class<br/>
that could wear Rubicite.<br/>
<br/>
- Journeyman&#39;s Boots will no longer spawn where they did but rather are<br/>
the products of a quest.<br/>
<br/>
[ How much do you want to bet completing this quest involves camping<br/>
something for an item which is just as rare as journeyman boots? ]<br/>
<br/>
- To address trade fraud (players removing items/money immediately prior<br/>
to trading to deceive the other player), items/money may only be removed<br/>
by clicking on the &quot;Cancel&quot; button.<br/>
<br/>
- When receiving a text message from either an NPC or PC speaking in a<br/>
language other than &quot;Common Tongue&quot;, if the user&#39;s language skill is high<br/>
enough, the language being spoken will be noted preceding the text.<br/>
<br/>
- The fishing pole will now appear in the player&#39;s hand whenever the<br/>
fishing skill is used.<br/>
<br/>
- A number of quests were both added and enhanced throughout the zones.<br/>
<br/>
*Trade Skills*<br/>
<br/>
A number of new items have been added to Blacksmithing.<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
- Some of the Items that Magicians Summon with their spells have been made<br/>
better / had their effects increased.<br/>
<br/>
- Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant, Tuyen&#39;s Chant of Flame and Tuyen&#39;s Chant of<br/>
Frost (BARD) have all had their effects slightly increased.<br/>
<br/>
[ Curtailing Chant was the L30 song that was lowering magic resist by 10<br/>
while having a minor DoT effect in the arena.  For comparison, Xitix&#39;s<br/>
level 20 tashini was lowering MR by 26.  Because most bard songs are<br/>
party/area effect and bards are supposed to be &quot;masters of none,&quot; Verant<br/>
tends to gimp our abilities beyond the point of uselessness.  The level 8<br/>
enchanter DoT did more damage than this song. ]<br/>
<br/>
- The Burnout Series (Magicians) has had the negative HP component reduced<br/>
(improvement) and the stat buff increased (improvement). Because of this,<br/>
the spells are no longer permanent - they now have a 15 minute duration.<br/>
Burnout III has also had its casting cost reduced.<br/>
<br/>
- Illusion: Werewolf attack speed component now works as intended.<br/>
<br/>
- Insipid Weakness (Enchanter) will research as intended.<br/>
<br/>
- The EverQuest Team</div>
