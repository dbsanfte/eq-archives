&gt;      Gentle Bards,<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      I keep trying this question looking for some hard info and I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;      noticed some messages flash by (It&#39;s really hard to find time to work, <br/>
&gt;      sleep, play EQ, and read all the message on this board. grin) about <br/>
&gt;      wanting dex jewelry items so I&#39;m going to ask again.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt;      What is better (for a bard, don&#39;t wanna get kaboonged...) Dex or <br/>
&gt;      Agility?  The manuals are rather vague on this.  Anyone done any <br/>
&gt;      testing?  Empirical evidence?  I have been mostly collecting Agility <br/>
&gt;      items based on messages I read in the past.  I personally have not <br/>
&gt;      noticed much effect with dex items even though I have a couple.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;      spent a lot of money (bard money) on agility items and I hope I <br/>
&gt;      haven&#39;t wasted it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t done any formal tests, but I&#39;ve played a lot with items for<br/>
both dex and agility and so has a L50 ranger friend of mine, and neither<br/>
of us can detect (empiriacally) a lot of difference between having 101<br/>
agility and 150 agility. Agility seems to only control how often the mob<br/>
misses you. Dex on the other hand seems to control success at hitting,<br/>
successful procing of weapons and successful triggering of things like<br/>
dual weild, or in a ranger&#39;s case, parry and riposte as well. I had been<br/>
mainly concentrating on building up dex and agility, wearing things like<br/>
2 serpentine bracers. I think I will be replacing one with something<br/>
that adds more AC, as AC itself at least reduces the damage you take.<br/>
<br/>
Some people claim adding agi+ items ups AC more but my experience with a<br/>
serpentine bracer (AC1 AGI9 I think) is that it adds less AC than a<br/>
plain rubicite bracer (can&#39;t remember AC)<br/>
