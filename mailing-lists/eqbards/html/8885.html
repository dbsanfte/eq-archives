He was so happy to finally get that ring, until everything attacked him.<br/>

&gt;This is another bug I have run into which creeped in in the last patch.<br/>
&gt;Apparently if you complete the Squad Ring Quest currently, you are handed<br/>
&gt;the ring and also immediately moved to KoS status will all residents of<br/>
&gt;Rivervale.  How the heck do they miss this stuff?  Sounds like they either<br/>
&gt;changed the faction hit for getting the ring, say from 5% to 100% (oops<br/>
&gt;D&#39;Vinn coder, should been 10%) or they added a faction gain that puts the<br/>
&gt;faction &#39;over the top&#39; thus turning it into a negative number.  After<br/>
&gt;telling my bardic friend on E&#39;ci how cool the ring was he finally completed<br/>
&gt;the quest this morning.  He is currently unable to play that character<br/>
 </span></blockquote>after<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;immediately dying to Marshal Ghobber and reappearing at his bind point...<br/>
&gt;Right in front of the PoD in the middle of Rivervale square.  Needless to<br/>
&gt;say the overzealous litle Zorros immediately whacked him again... and<br/>
&gt;again... and again... before he figured out what must be happening and<br/>
&gt;pulled the plug.  I saw 4 corpses in the Marshal Ghobber room last nite but<br/>
&gt;thought little of it chalking it up to the usual<br/>
&gt;W...H &quot;Hail Marshal Ghobber&quot;...A &quot;you hit Marshal Ghobber but he dodges&quot;<br/>
&gt;syndrome of forgetting to hit ENTER first.<br/>
&gt;This appears to be a major screwup that has seriously affected quite a<br/>
&gt;number of characters due to careless coding yet again.  I&#39;m certain my<br/>
&gt;friend has lost at least one level if not more before he was disconnected.<br/>
&gt;Not to mention the incredible amount of work he put into getting his<br/>
 </span></blockquote>faction<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;high enough to get the ring in the first place.<br/>
&gt;Has anyone else experienced this?<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any word on how they are planning on fixing this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kitasi<br/>
&gt; Once more very glad I already have my Squad Ring!<br/>
