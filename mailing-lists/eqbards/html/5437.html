&gt;Sorry for the late post.  I have been on vacation.<br/>
&gt;I hate checking my mail on vacation.  I like playing EQ tho.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Topic was why did Harmonic chide Sylly for 50pp and Estella<br/>
&gt;for 75pp for elfhide gloves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) When you are level 19 (which I was) you don&#39;t just throw<br/>
&gt;   out 50pp or more on something like that.  Hell, you are<br/>
&gt;   lucky to make 25pp on a hard working night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) People who claim that plat is worthless, and that making<br/>
&gt;   a couple hundred pp is no big deal are full of it.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   that traditional level 35+ person talking.  Refer to earlier<br/>
&gt;   comment on my level at the time.  You don&#39;t make that much<br/>
&gt;   money if you are a lower level adventurer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) I&#39;ve seen those gloves sell for 35pp to 45pp, in fact people<br/>
&gt;   are willing to hand those gloves out at no cost sometimes!<br/>
&gt;   I like to deal the price down on anything I buy, I don&#39;t just<br/>
&gt;   throw plat at people for good items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;----<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All that said, I bought elfhide gloves from a friend of mine last<br/>
&gt;week for 75pp.  She needed the money, and you know what?  I had<br/>
&gt;the money.  For once in my poor EQ career, I was starting to earn<br/>
&gt;money.  Anyone under level 25 can appreciate that... you won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;make money until you are around level 30 or so.  All the people<br/>
&gt;who claim to make mad money are all over level 25 - there is no<br/>
&gt;trick to it.  Level = Money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also bought two star ruby golden rings (300pp total - killer deal)<br/>
&gt;Yes, because I had the money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t play me off as some cheap bastard like I was 11 levels ago,<br/>
&gt;when I was lucky to make 10pp a night.  I&#39;m pulling down around<br/>
&gt;50pp a night or so and I&#39;m happy as a clam to spend my money. =)<br/>
