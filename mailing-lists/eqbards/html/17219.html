&gt;obvious he was twinked.  Here was this level 10 wood elf bard, dressed<br/>
&gt;head to toe in bronze.  I gave him the gauntlets, and he very graciously<br/>
&gt;gave me his old bronze gauntlets. :)  They look nice on Adagia, but I<br/>
&gt;think they are too heavy, I&#39;ll probably just stick to banded for now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. My own half-elf bard has discarded bronze in favor of lesser AC,<br/>
lighter pieces as well. (A bronze breastplate discarded in favor<br/>
of the Lockjaw Hide Vest that a hunting partner handed her, only<br/>
2 kills after she first put the bronze BP on.) The gloves and boots<br/>
are particularly heinous in terms of weight to AC ratio.</div>
