<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561357176">It would be _really_ hard for you to get the other items needed to complete<br/>
a lambent quest - even if someone else did all the killing for you - because<br/>
the other items come from mobs that live in zones where you would be &quot;eaten<br/>
alive&quot; and quickly - sorry to say.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the easiest quest to do is the Lambent Bracers - you need a<br/>
gryfeene charm (North Karana Grifeenes - you can maybe run around NK but<br/>
lots and lots of lions and gryfawns roaming about - but if you had a<br/>
friend(s) go kill until they get a loot - then you run in and loot and run<br/>
out - it could be done.  <br/>
<br/>
The next item you need would be a dark bone bracelet which comes from<br/>
greater dark bone skellies in Unrest.  At level 11, I guess you could get to<br/>
Unrest but Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron would have danger for you and you&#39;d have to be<br/>
really careful getting thru to Unrest.  Then in Unrest - there are lots and<br/>
lots of live and dead things that will want to kill you.  I suppose you<br/>
could be invis to live and find a spot that is safe from the death beetles<br/>
then get invis to undead and have your friends kill a GDBS and you run in<br/>
and loot and run like mad for the zone.  I mean all this is theoretically<br/>
possible - but practical?  I think not.  <br/>
<br/>
And then it would be kinda hard for a lev 11 to get thru lavastorm to the<br/>
temple - hell, I was attacked by a fire elemental at 26 or 28 and had to<br/>
flee.  And then do you have 111pp to buy the gems needed to make the lambent<br/>
gem?  But who knows if you did the quest, you might 2 levels of XP (joke)<br/>
and you&#39;d deserve it if you survived all that!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, I am the last one to say anything bad about twinking but at level 11 -<br/>
you&#39;d need higher levs to do all the killing and basically you&#39;d be risking<br/>
your life in a big way just to do the looting.  If you have the friends to<br/>
do the killing, let one guy get the loot items. Go with him to the temple,<br/>
complete the quest together.  Not sure if the lambent gem is no drop but if<br/>
he has it made - you won&#39;t need to worry - ie give him the lambent stone and<br/>
let him make the lambent gem.  And then there&#39;s the matter of 111pp...<br/>
<br/>
These quests are designed to give players in high 20&#39;s and all 30&#39;s<br/>
something to do in groups.  <br/>

		Hello.<br/>
<br/>
		I must say first of all, that I&#39;m only level 11.  I managed<br/>
to come into a<br/>
		lambent stone by trading a wooden totem for it, in North<br/>
Karana.  Now that I<br/>
		have one, is there any chance at all I can get a piece of<br/>
lambent armor, or<br/>
		do I just get to stick it in the bank until later levels?<br/>
