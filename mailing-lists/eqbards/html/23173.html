how many people starting now have any idea of what skills and abilities are gained post 50<br/>
and use that to make a decision on which character to play?<br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s an example i used on the concert hall.  take a level 15 paladin vs a level 15<br/>
warrior.  ok the warrior has a 10% exp bonus, but, how do these 2 compare on a<br/>
&#39;&#39;power ranking&#39;&#39; level?  the paladin is FAR better than the warrior.  the warrior&#39;s defensive<br/>
skills are nonexistent at this point.  the warrior&#39;s higher skill caps won&#39;t make any<br/>
difference until they hit level 40+.  But the paladin gets to heal and loh which allows him<br/>
to go after &#39;&#39;bigger&#39;&#39; targets with less downtime.  i personally think the sub 40 game<br/>
is now very unbalanced towards hybrids, but maybe now that the game is &#39;&#39;mature&#39;&#39;<br/>
and such a large portion of the player base is post 40, it just doesn&#39;t matter.</div>
