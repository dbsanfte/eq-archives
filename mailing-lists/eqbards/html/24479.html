<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501103971">Yea I actually kind of dont like being in the pull group because of agro,<br/>
but my guild&#39;s Modus Operandi seems to be group 1 is:<br/>
Main tank (who often pulls, we are a bit short on monks and SKs)<br/>
Paladin (for stuns and CH I imagine)<br/>
Main Enchanter<br/>
Cleric (usually the highest)<br/>
Highest Druid (for backup heals, usually he ends up healing me, heh)<br/>
Highest Bard (yours truly, our guild is seriously lacking in bards, I joined<br/>
about a month ago and usually I am the only one there, on the upside I am<br/>
getting some great equipment, heh)<br/>
<br/>
I sing clarity while pulling (small radius, if puller is in the range, no<br/>
way the group isnt getting agroed).  Is the radius in 55 song bigger?  I<br/>
dinged 54 this weekend, so I am not too far (one hella long level) away.<br/>
When the fight starts I do Song of Shields, Cantata (34 one), Nillipus<br/>
(sometimes this is replaced by a second pulse of SoS since we end up with<br/>
all the buff slots filled and the cleric cant use Heal over time spells).<br/>
THe only problem I see to run into is the agro I created is pretty ugly...<br/>
