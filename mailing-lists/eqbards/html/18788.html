&gt; lot of time camping a greenie mob.  I believe Verant said they were gonna<br/>
&gt; increase the drop rate on the keys.  If you&#39;ve been following the corpse<br/>
&gt; recovery dabate recently, this dungeon was part of the ordeal.  Apparently six<br/>
&gt; 50+ people went to Howling Stones to explore it.  I believe they were the first<br/>
&gt; group on their server to do so.  To there horror, there were six level 50+ mobs<br/>
&gt; waiting for them when they completed zoning in.  Since they weren&#39;t able to all<br/>
&gt; zone in at the same time (lag, connection speed, etc), each one of them got gang<br/>
&gt; raped by six mobs as soon as they completed zoning.  So all six of them now had<br/>
&gt; corpses in a zone that required a special key to get into.  That meant they all<br/>
&gt; had to camp the greenie mob again to get the keys.  And since the six mobs would<br/>
&gt; still be there, they would have to treat this like a Fear break and get a lot of<br/>
&gt; other people to help them with CR.  This meant camping the key for those people<br/>
&gt; as well.  This all took a lot of time and they were concerned that 24 hours of<br/>
&gt; online time would pass before they were able to get keys for everyone.  Not<br/>
&gt; certain how this issue was resolved but I believe a GM gave them 12 keys so they<br/>
&gt; could do CR.  No idea what happened after this.<br/>

unsympathetic server GM compared to other servers like the one I&#39;m on<br/>
now. I believe he had to be ordered to even give them the keys by higher<br/>
ups at Verant after they publicized their plight. I know that GMs on<br/>
other servers take a lot more flexible approach to their customer<br/>
service, especially with design flaw/&quot;features&quot; that the live team<br/>
implements.<br/>
