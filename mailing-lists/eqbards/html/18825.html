<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478128609">Don&#39;t put words in my mouth.  I did not say that I was &quot;thrilled&quot; with<br/>
summon food and water.  I was merely saying that it DID have a use,<br/>
especially in the light of our being a utility class.  Of COURSE I&#39;d rather<br/>
have better effects on those items.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Also, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; food and drink that you summon can be given to your<br/>
&gt; &gt; group as well.  This<br/>
&gt; &gt; means that not only you, but your party members<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to want for food<br/>
&gt; &gt; and drink either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But to work thru 50 odd lvls to have the same ability<br/>
&gt; as a 1st lvl magician seems a bit anticlimatic, to say<br/>
&gt; the least.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Glad you are thrilled with this new ability...I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; much happier to see us able to summon, say Beer<br/>
&gt; braised Lion that doesn&#39;t evaporate when we log tho<br/>
&gt; ... then I&#39;d be happier.  But that&#39;s just me.<br/>
