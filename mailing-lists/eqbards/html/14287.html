&gt; Please refrain from posting this sort of rant. It&#39;s not someone I want<br/>
&gt; cluttering my inbox. Here&#39;s an example for you. If you go to a fine<br/>
&gt; restaurant, then order food, but dislike it intensely, complain to the<br/>
&gt; chef of it&#39;s quality, then demand your money back, do you go back there<br/>
&gt; the next night for dinner, hoping the chef has miraculously changed his<br/>
&gt; cooking style to suit you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just one point to make here. I&#39;ve been following this list since June or<br/>
so, and most of what I&#39;ve read from Kim and Ryan has been useful<br/>
discussion, analysis, and tips on how to play the bard. In fact, they<br/>
are probably 2 of the more prolific posters to the list and I usually<br/>
find the threads they post in to be very interesting. However, the only<br/>
posts I can recall reading from the recent complainers about their<br/>
latest postings are, the complaints.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, if your only contribution to the list is to complain<br/>
when a couple of prolific posters deviate from what you want to hear,<br/>
are you really contributing? Is this list just here for your<br/>
entertainment in read only mode or is it here for everyone to share all<br/>
aspects of the bard class in this game, the good and the bad.<br/>
