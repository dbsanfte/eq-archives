satisfying seeing one (green) caster drop another (blue)<br/>
caster in all of two seconds once I&#39;d charmed it and ordered<br/>
it to attack.<br/>

One more warning about Siren&#39;s.  If your pet does the most<br/>
damage (would&#39;ve gotten the kill) and becomes uncharmed and<br/>
thus is not a pet anymore when your friends finish off the<br/>
other mob, because a non-player did the most damage, the<br/>
corpse disappears.  This is not a problem when you&#39;re soloing<br/>
because you&#39;re usually letting your pet make the kill.  But<br/>
when you&#39;re in a group, sometimes your party finishes off the<br/>
mob before you can recharm your pet, and the corpse<br/>
disappears.<br/>
<br/>
That still leaves the question - if your pet does 99% of the<br/>
damage and gets killed, and someone else does the other 1%,<br/>
who gets credit for the kill?<br/>
