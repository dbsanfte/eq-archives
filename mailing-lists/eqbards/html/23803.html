<div id="ygrps-yiv-71610774">Yea. I can confirm this. My low level cleric was able to Stun and Holy <br/>
Might giants in Warslik&#39;s woods. Curiously my enchanter friend said he <br/>
wasn&#39;t able to mez them, but perhaps he was just getting resists from them.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Was in a FM giant group last night that pulled 2, and the one resisted<br/>
&gt;every<br/>
&gt; &gt;strike I threw at it...a good 5 or 6 or so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;you should have gotten the message &quot;that [something] cannot be mezmerized<br/>
&gt;with that spell&#39;&#39; or<br/>
&gt;something similar to that.  nothing flagged with the &#39;&#39;giant flag&#39;&#39; can be<br/>
&gt;mezzed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Of course, it liked me best after that.  :P<br/>
