<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-739975320">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
    I have a question on good places/bad places for AE songs... last night<br/>
my guild was spelunking around in upper guk ruining our factor and we ran<br/>
into multiple spawns in numerous locations (this was our first time there as<br/>
a group, and on Nameless it rocked to see 7 people total in the zone, 6 of<br/>
whom comprised my group) - ideal places to use AE songs, however I&#39;ve read<br/>
horror stories... so I wimped out and didn&#39;t use them.<br/>
<br/>
    So which parts of guk are okay places and which are begging for that oh<br/>
so familiar &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&quot; screen to pop up? :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
