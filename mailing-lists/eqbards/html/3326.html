<div id="ygrps-yiv-53810460">A developer has publicly stated that twisting was intended and that bards<br/>
were designed with this in mind.  Do you really think that they would be so<br/>
blind as to not realize this is being done?  And then not put in the simple<br/>
patch that only one bard song can take hold at a time?  Especially since<br/>
there are all kinds of measures dealing with which songs stack with others<br/>
and which don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
As far as the benefits to twisting, try some very simple combos:<br/>
Kiting: Selo&#39;s + Hymn<br/>
Soloing: Warsong + Bellow + Bellow<br/>
Tank Aid: Anthem + Hymn + Binding<br/>
Anti-Caster: Guardian + Elemental<br/>
Max Damage: Chords + Denon&#39;s + Bellow<br/>
<br/>
Banilore Bel&#39;Canto<br/>
22nd Level Half-Elf Bard<br/>
Master Brewer<br/>
Tarew Marr</div>
