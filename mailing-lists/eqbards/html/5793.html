<div id="ygrps-yiv-487833406">Replying to those who asked what to solo at 23:<br/>
<br/>
I picked up some steady experience by soloing the crocs and caimans in oasis.<br/>
It isn&#39;t at all thrilling,<br/>
but if you just want to pick up experience and can&#39;t find a group, it works.<br/>
You can earn a bubble<br/>
perhaps every three hours, if it isn&#39;t too crowded.  Grouping with one other<br/>
player works, too.  Watch out for giants and spectres.</div>
