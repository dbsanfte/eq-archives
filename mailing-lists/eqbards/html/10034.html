<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022963019">Wow, i assume this was bard only as well?  i know people who have seen the<br/>
Maestro with a mace, but they were unable to kill him that night.  i assumed<br/>
it was the cleric mace Dawnfire.  by the way, the Six Note Blade can be held<br/>
in either hand, therefore a bard can duel wield two 11 25 weapons.<br/>
amazingly nice.<br/>
