<div id="ygrps-yiv-465479457">Good thing I checked the message boards ;) I visit the mailing list, <br/>
but not regularly (There&#39;s just too much stuff out there :()  FYI, <br/>
the best thing to do with errors is to e-mail me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqreed@...">eqreed@...</a>).<br/>

Anyhow, The problem with chant of battle with a drum, is that I have <br/>
no numbers before the 15th level.  When I don&#39;t have data, I just put <br/>
in zero :(<br/>
<br/>
Set your level to 15, and you&#39;ll start seeing some numbers.  If you <br/>
have any drum numbers for less than level 15, I&#39;d love to know :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also debating going to a pure &quot;formula&quot; version, but that&#39;s down <br/>
the line.<br/>

&gt; Was just checking the calculator, and I noticed that according to <br/>
it, you <br/>
&gt; always get 0 for using an instrument with Chant of Battle - but <br/>
Chant <br/>
&gt; definitely has a bonus with an instrument.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just thought I&#39;d mention it.<br/>
