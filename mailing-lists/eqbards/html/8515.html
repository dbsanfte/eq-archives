<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063332299"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Castle Mistmoore can flush a full 40+ group very quickly.<br/>
&gt;Chances that you&#39;ll loot the item are extremely slim below<br/>
&gt;level 40 &lt;g&gt;   Being level 50 there is meaningless, too --<br/>
&gt;either way no matter what your level, things get ugly fast.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dunno your level or type of group you play with, but you are in error (not a<br/>
direct personal attack, maybe just misinformed). A friend of mine (Druid 50)<br/>
and myself (Warrior 45) are able to clear out the Princess, Butler, Maid,<br/>
Vampire, and gypsy (late, cant think of the exact names) spots in about 15<br/>
mins. Only had to evac once and that was due to someone having a look see,<br/>
and not conning the will sappers who see through invis. Pulled quite an<br/>
impressive train, and hope he could appreciate how big it was. Maybe take<br/>
some comfort his death impressed others =)<br/>
As to bards in there, way back when a lot of us were around 35 we took a<br/>
party in there containing two bards, a cleric, druid, warrior and necro. No<br/>
one died, and it was great fun playing around inside the castle. Just take a<br/>
group of people that you trust not to dork out on you, and that you have<br/>
played together a lot, and you will do fine.<br/>
Do it at the lower levels, cause once you hit 45 plus, place turns into<br/>
green hell.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun out there<br/>
