<div id="ygrps-yiv-22799091">I know exactly how you feel Roop, I had the same thoughts myself. BUt<br/>
if you are willing to hang in there for a little bit I think your<br/>
patience will pay off. The reason for this is group teleports. It used<br/>
to be when my friends and I are logged on we plan to go to one dungeon<br/>
and see what we can do in there and then call it a night. Nowadays we<br/>
got to a dungeon, do as much as we can in there and then group gate<br/>
elsewhere and have fun there too. It&#39;s great. Run into Solusek A and<br/>
clear out the area all the way into the Goblin King, then group gate to<br/>
Unrest and kill the ghost in there and then move on to Mistmoore, all<br/>
in one night. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing, overcrowded dungeons. I don&#39;t know how it is on your<br/>
server but on Innoruuk, Unrest and Cazic Thule are the most camped<br/>
dungeons. Solusek B is usually filled with the higher level people<br/>
trying to exp and so is Lower Guk. Mistmoore has a decent number of<br/>
people most of the time. Other than that, there really isn&#39;t many<br/>
people anywhere else. Najena is usually empty except for the Drezlna<br/>
room. Solusek A is hardly filled and it&#39;s a great dungeon in my<br/>
opinion. Guk is also usually deserted except for a high level wizard<br/>
camping the scryer. Permafrost usually has a group or two but since<br/>
it&#39;s so big, there&#39;s plenty of gobs to go around for a couple more<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that for me, the best resource I can have is a steady group<br/>
of friends that I can group with. I am not in a guild for personal<br/>
reasons but I know enough people to group with constantly and have lots<br/>
of fun. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>
