<div id="ygrps-yiv-416485950"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have mostly banded, plus bronze pants, gauntlets, and helm.  The<br/>
&gt; Dwarven tunic blends well enough with the tunic.  But, I really hate<br/>
&gt; the look of the bronze helm on wood elf females.  It totally covers my<br/>
&gt; face.  The banded has a nice egyptian look, but the bronze looks like<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wearing a small trash can on my head.  I may just give up the<br/>
&gt; extra AC and get a banded helm instead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go for a Lumberjack&#39;s cap, AC 12 +3 stamina and it looks like leather, about<br/>
60-80pp I think, but worth it for the helm-free look.<br/>
