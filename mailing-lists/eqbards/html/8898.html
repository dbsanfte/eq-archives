&gt; By the way, I think I&#39;ve figured out that really annoying bug<br/>
&gt; where a charmed creature attacks a player.  When you re-charm,<br/>
&gt; your pet attacks whatever is at the top of its hate list (bard<br/>
&gt; excepted since charm makes it view you amiably).  When you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But when you&#39;re playing grouped, the extra mob(s) usually<br/>
&gt; attack party members instead of your pet, and thus your pet is<br/>
&gt; never damaged and never hates the other mobs.  But some party<br/>
&gt; members probably attacked it, or gained hatred for pulling it,<br/>
&gt; so upon recharm, your pet automatically attacks the player.  I<br/>

playing with was DoTing the kobolds before I charmed them<br/>
(DoTs continue to work despite charm).  I&#39;d order my pet to<br/>
attack another kobold, it would, and a few seconds later it&#39;d<br/>
turn around to attack the druid.<br/>
