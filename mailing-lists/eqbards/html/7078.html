<br/>
this is the one good place I have found for the Melifious Motion song - esp<br/>
when with younger groups - you are in the center of a 4 bird spawn and I<br/>
have seen 3 avo&#39;s spawn at the same time.  It makes for an excellent<br/>
evacuation tool.<br/>
<br/>
also lament is great here - sadden the ones you don&#39;t want to fight and pull<br/>
the others to the outter edge and fite it there (don&#39;t fight in the middle<br/>
of the room) - then you only fight 2 if the 4th spot spawns while u are in<br/>
melee.<br/>
<br/>
These are good tricks I learned from Jaezebel - younger but lots smarter<br/>
bardess than me!<br/>
<br/>
Me, I stand in the middle of the room and play chords.  That way I can get<br/>
the birds that spawn on the ground to attack me even though I am some 5<br/>
stories up off the ground.  BTW: Krak the merchant birdie like my singing<br/>
too!  In fact he&#39;ll run all the way to the zone with me when I am playing my<br/>
songs!<br/>

		Last night, at the suggestion of a few people from this<br/>
list, I ventured for<br/>
		the first time to South Karana to hunt aviaks.  I had been<br/>
in South Karana<br/>
		before to complete the Qeynos bard quest but had never<br/>
fought anything<br/>
		there.  I joined a group that consisted of five 28th level<br/>
players, four of<br/>
		which were casters.  The fifth person was a 28th level bard<br/>
(Cherlas).  To<br/>
		avoid overlapping songs in combat, we agreed that she would<br/>
sing the level<br/>
		25-28 songs while I would sing anthem, chain, and anything<br/>
else appropriate.<br/>
		We were camping at the top of the village where avocets,<br/>
harriers, rooks,<br/>
		and darters all spawn (very quickly).  I fought with this<br/>
group for almost<br/>
		two hours.  Me and the other bard were the default tanks.<br/>
For the first<br/>
		time in a long time, I was no longer the center of<br/>
attention.  In almost<br/>
		every fight, the 28th level bard would pull and get the<br/>
aviaks initial<br/>
		attention.  When one of the casters unloaded on the aviak,<br/>
they often found<br/>
		themselves the center of attention.  I, on the other hand,<br/>
almost never got<br/>
		attacked the entire night.  The most health I ever dropped<br/>
to was about 50%.<br/>
		This happened when an avocet spawned while we were in the<br/>
process of<br/>
		fighting a rook and a harrier.  <br/>
<br/>
		Moral of the story: Two bards in a group can be lots of fun.<br/>
The lower<br/>
		level bard also has the luxury of not having to worry too<br/>
much about getting<br/>
		continually whacked on.  <br/>
