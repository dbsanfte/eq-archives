<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166162244">Brahma&#39;s Horn can be found of a named mino (Brahma) in Beholders, he&#39;s the level of a gorge mino and not very hard to kill. Just a<br/>
rare spawn.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Harmonic..I know what your thinking..NO I won&#39;t help you get them :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;The offer for sol A still stands though  :)<br/>

&gt; Mistmoore Battle Drums...<br/>
&gt; I was lucky enough to obtain a set of these from a good friend<br/>
&gt; of mine when I was just a pup.  What I&#39;m ready to go after is<br/>
&gt; Brahm&#39;s Horn, from the named mino 40ish or so, I&#39;m told.  I<br/>
&gt; would imagine a good party of 30-35s could take him out very<br/>
&gt; easily.  Lord Grimrot is 37th, and was beaten by a 30,34,35.<br/>
&gt; And Grimrot hits _hard_.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for SolA, since the weekend is here (meaning the jerks sign<br/>
&gt; on in numbers) I will be leaving CT tonight and heading out<br/>
&gt; to somewhere else.  So SolA would be a good idea.  I cannot<br/>
&gt; stand rubi-itis when it rears its ugly face.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think my first stop is Permafrost for a white wolf cloak and<br/>
&gt; a 1h silvery war axe.  I know exactly who to kill for what, I<br/>
&gt; just never had the group to clear and hold the throne room.<br/>
&gt; Maybe pick up a mammoth cloak, CIMS, or runed circlet for trade.<br/>
&gt; I could have gotten rubi legs last night had I camped the alchemist<br/>
&gt; a few more days for another cloak.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am definitely up for SolA this weekend, if it&#39;s convenient.<br/>
&gt; The charred BP would be nice, I just get lost in the gnome<br/>
&gt; castle too often.  As for the gloves...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; charred gloves: ac7, +3dex, +5int<br/>
&gt; elfhide gloves: ac4, +5dex, +5agi<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can justify the loss of 3ac (and the useless int) for +2 more dex<br/>
&gt; and +5 more agi.  Elfhide gloves are the deal.  Wish they were black.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have already obtained a pair of charred boots.  But the BP would<br/>
&gt; be nice.<br/>
