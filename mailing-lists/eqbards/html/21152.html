<div id="ygrps-yiv-411148040">Uhm, responding before reading the full thread but - this guide is very<br/>
dated.  There are at 3 least other better ways to break PoF.  Some stuff is<br/>
pretty standard planes ops but SW is a great place to LOSE alot of exp with<br/>
multiple deaths if you so desire.<br/>
<br/>
We setup outside PoF - make 4 groups or whatever.  Send in first 2 groups,<br/>
10-20 seconds apart.  They are sow&#39;d and invised and they make a left turn<br/>
and run to the west wall - trying to avoid any agro - fairly easy to do.<br/>
Once they are set, if not agro&#39;d, they can cal in the 3rd group.  By then,<br/>
almost certainly agro&#39;d and fighting.  2 or 3 mid 50 and up groups with<br/>
enchanters can easily handle the break. If they want some help and the route<br/>
from the portal is clear, they can call in the next and subsequent groups.<br/>
The key thing is controlling the amount and rate of agro by controlling then<br/>
number of folks running in. Less is more in this case.<br/>
<br/>
I heard other folks like to run to a north wall camp and others insist a NW<br/>
wall run in is great.  But why run in, die, CR, camp off agro, etc etc etc<br/>
when you can walk in and kill them all?<br/>

This is a guide lifted from the Bristlebane Sever. It describes a West wall<br/>
camp. It has been edited for both format and some content that I deemed<br/>
irrelevant. The full version is here:<br/>
