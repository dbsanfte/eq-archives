You would be perfect in North Karana. Scythe Beetles and Borer Beetles are<br/>
too slow to catch you, and you can simply run in circles bellowing that<br/>
boisterous voice of yours until they&#39;ve had enough. I find the effect to be<br/>
much like Jythri, after several flagons of Kalish.<br/>
<br/>
Also, though let it be whispered only amoung bards, you can manage a<br/>
Griffawn in much the same way. I highly recommend the ancient Combine Gates<br/>
in North Ro as a place to lay your gear whilst you hunt.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a colder temperment, you should visit Everfrost. Nothing fills<br/>
me more than to fell a great Mammoth with my tunes. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you find your greener pastures... I know the thirst for leaving the<br/>
desert runs deep in me.<br/>

This is a great discussion board... we&#39;ve discussed<br/>
songs, effects, and bardic life...<br/>
<br/>
but now, I wanna ask a few new general questions... What is there to hunt?  <br/>
Where should I go?<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 14 bard and have spent most of my life in<br/>
the Freeport-commonlands-Nro-oasis area...  don&#39;t get<br/>
me wrong, there is some great hunting there and I have<br/>
made many friends... but I want adventure and<br/>
excitment ;)  I&#39;ve done some wandering on my own and<br/>
traveling, but I usually get really lost or reallydead... both not too<br/>
good.  <br/>
<br/>
I ask all wise bards from other areas to give me some<br/>
advice... what&#39;s out there?  How do I get to those<br/>
areas that have cool stuff, like spiked collars and<br/>
bronze armor, etc...  Anything cool out at Qeynos or<br/>
Halas?  I&#39;ve been to Kelethin and crushbone, but the<br/>
huntings kinda slim, and very crowded ;)  Lately I&#39;ve<br/>
been cutting down on my random adventures because I&#39;m<br/>
too scared to die and lose my body in a place meant<br/>
for levels 40+  Where are these elementals to fight? <br/>
What&#39;s in the Lavastorm mountains?  anything to hunt<br/>
near erudin?  Where are the dragons? (even though I<br/>
probably wanna stay away from that)  How do people<br/>
keep leveling up so high?  All those beta people know<br/>
all the areas, I have no idea...<br/>
<br/>
Forgive my ramblings, I just want to see the worldsemi-safely...<br/>
