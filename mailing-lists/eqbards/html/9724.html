<br/>
Your level 8 song will help you when you want to fight only one mob at a<br/>
time but there are other mobs near him and an attack would normally pull all<br/>
of the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
SO, you use your song to target each of the weaker mobs in the group and<br/>
Lament them (or &quot;lull&quot; them not to be confused with lullaby which &quot;sleeps&quot;<br/>
them.)  The lament or lull reduces their &quot;agro&quot; or agressiveness so that an<br/>
attack on the highest one will pull only the highest one for you or your<br/>
party to fight and kill.  <br/>
<br/>
You lull the weak ones first so that the chance of a resist is lower.  The<br/>
higher the mob the more likely of a resist and a subsequent attack.  Be<br/>
ready to run!<br/>
<br/>
Lament is a target song - you target and lamant each weaker one.  Then<br/>
attack the strongest one.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-combat crowd controll.  Great for gnolls, bandit, orc and derv camps.<br/>
You may need to get a few more level before you will fight many bigger orcs<br/>
and dervs. <br/>

ok I know that you are mostly all way higher ups and stuff..but I have<br/>
just reached level 8 with my bard.  She is really a lot of fun but I<br/>
have a few questions.  First of all....what is the stats that bards<br/>
need to work on...(cha?  dex?  str?) I have concentrated on those 3<br/>
things and with ALL my stuff on my cha is 133 and my str is 99...not<br/>
sure my dex...please can someone advise me on that.  Next is that I<br/>
just got my lvl 8 song and I remember reading that it was such a useful<br/>
spell once..when i first got on the list and my bard was like lvl 3 and<br/>
i had no idea what anyone was talking about.  I have looked through<br/>
some archives but there is SOO much stuff...its difficult to locate. <br/>
Please can someone help me out here...between playing my druid in the<br/>
main I am really beginning to enjoy my bard if I can understand the<br/>
songs and use them to their full extent.  Thanks<br/>
