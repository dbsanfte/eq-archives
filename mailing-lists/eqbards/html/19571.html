To the tune of Sweet Home Alabama, by Lynyrd Skynyrd. <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------- <br/>
<br/>
Mistmoore drums keep on thumping,<br/>
Dinged from a beastie I just killed,<br/>
Singing Selo&#39;s moves me faster,<br/>
I zone to Qeynos and I&#39;m thrilled, time to hit the guild. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I heard that people have been leaving,<br/>
In endless droves to see Kunark,<br/>
My friend&#39;s a Necro and she&#39;s hurtin&#39;,<br/>
She&#39;s KOS because she&#39;s Dark, leaves a mark.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet home Antonica, can&#39;t kill Griffawns, outta luck,<br/>
Sweet home Antonica, that thing&#39;s a greenie, WTF? <br/>
<br/>
In Firiona there&#39;s no trainer (boo hoo hoo)<br/>
Now, how am I supposed to learn?<br/>
I feel the need to kill some froggies,<br/>
For Lambent Armour I still yearn, one day I&#39;ll earn. <br/>
<br/>
Sweet home Antonica, run for your life in Kithicor,<br/>
Sweet home Antonica, that&#39;s what the Forest wall is for.<br/>
<br/>
One day in Mistmoore killing inkies,<br/>
A Gypsy Lute I tried to camp,<br/>
Someone yelled out a train was comin&#39;<br/>
Chased back to the zone by a Vamp, what a tramp. <br/>
<br/>
Sweet home Antonica, done with swinging through the trees.<br/>
Sweet home Antonica, missed the boat, who&#39;s porting please? <br/>
<br/>
Sweet home Antonica, Greater Fay is just a zoo,<br/>
Sweet home Antonica, Lord, I&#39;m coming home to you. <br/>
