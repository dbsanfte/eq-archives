&gt;In case no one has tried today to use the optional patch button, give it a <br/>
&gt;push!  It seems that Verant has uploaded Paineel onto the patch server.  I <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know what their plans were for this area, but I&#39;m assuming its for <br/>
&gt;upper levels.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The crystal ball tells me much - first of all, this zone is not yet <br/>
complete.  Second, it appears full of rats, bats, beetles and kobolds, so I <br/>
wonder about the &quot;high level&quot; concept - methinks it is actually for <br/>
low-level necros and such.  Third, any queries as to the nature of my <br/>
crystal ball shall be ignored ;)  It wouldn&#39;t be a mystery if I told you, <br/>
now would it?<br/>
