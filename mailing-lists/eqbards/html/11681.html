<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153336400">Here here.  I ended up giving someone a piece of my mind last night.  I was charming hill giants in rathe<br/>
mountains (ok, it&#39;s boring, but I needed some cash).  There was one relatively inactive group there when I<br/>
got there.  They were slowly pulling HGs, and were hanging out by the lizard camp.  So I headed back to<br/>
the large area in the corner tucked in the back of the hill.  I pulled a couple giants and was doing my<br/>
thing.  I had killed one and had pulled the next, and they were beating on each other happily, when I spot<br/>
a druid in wolf form heading toward them.  Oh great, I thought, someone to come in and disrupt my chores.<br/>
Well, the druid moved closer and closer to the pair, finally stopping right at their feet.  Well, wouldn&#39;t<br/>
you know, the giant came un-charmed, and of course the one I hadn&#39;t charmed started beating on him.  Chaos<br/>
ensued as I tried to re-charm (which is time consuming with that 80% resist rate at my level).  He ran to<br/>
his group, which was unprepared, and had a casualty.  I managed to recharm, and eventually succeeded in<br/>
finishing the job.  Well, this was all unfortunate, but then the druid sends me a nasty tell saying,<br/>
&quot;Dammit!  Stop training HG&#39;s onto us!&quot;  And additionally, &quot;I hate that bard HG kiting crap!  It gets<br/>
innocent people killed!&quot;  Well, needless to say I chewed him out.  Amazingly (unlike other similar<br/>
encounters) he came around and we agreed it would be ok if I stayed in my corner (which I had been doing<br/>
anyway) and didn&#39;t train the giants around.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I eventually stopped anyway, because a 45th level wizard came in and was doin a pretty good job<br/>
clearing the area of all but the occasional single pop of HGs (can&#39;t do much with just one!   :)  This was<br/>
fine.  Fairly done, and the biggest drawback to using charm in the first place.  Lack of mobs to charm.<br/>
<br/>
Just though I&#39;d share, since it was so rediculously moronic.  :)<br/>

&gt; They were just a bunch of conspiracy theorist idiots then.  Who in their<br/>
&gt; right mind would even THINK of doing that?  Even if, for some bizzare<br/>
&gt; reason, you DID destroy it before suiciding, (if you had had it in the first<br/>
&gt; place) they would have &quot;won&quot; since you didn&#39;t have it anymore and would now<br/>
&gt; have to wait on another.  What a bunch of morons.  I would have had to give<br/>
&gt; them a huuuuuuge piece of my mind at that point.  There isw just no excuse<br/>
&gt; for such stupidity.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I offered that, and they said All that I had to do is destroy the mask<br/>
&gt; &gt;before I suicide.<br/>
&gt; &gt;They would not have given me a rez.<br/>

&gt; &gt;You could have easily defended your honor, though at cost.  Had you offered<br/>
&gt; &gt;to suicide against the nearest frog and then given her permission to loot<br/>
&gt; &gt;your corpse she would have seen you had no mask.  Of course getting back<br/>
&gt; &gt;there to get another would have been tough, and the lost xp sad.  But more<br/>
&gt; &gt;than likely the embarrassment her group would have felt after you killed<br/>
&gt; &gt;yourself to prove your honor would have made them feel compelled to help<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt;get another.  Might have even gotten a rez.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well, I mosied on down to Lower guk, naked, following the excellent<br/>
&gt; &gt;instructions given.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Went down naked;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Made it to the Tower allright, and to the assassin room. This is where the<br/>
&gt; &gt;MAnure hit the proverbial fan (sighs sadly).<br/>
&gt; &gt;I waited to look up the ladder until All the casting was done. I peeked my<br/>
&gt; &gt;head up to see what the room looked like, and dropped back down.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Not one second after I did this, some dark elf woman jumps down, and calls<br/>
&gt; &gt;me a Thief. Loot thief. every name in the bloody book..<br/>
&gt; &gt;all I said was &quot;eh?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;and she went on to say She saw me on the ladder, then the corpse<br/>
&gt; &gt;dissappeared, then I &quot;ran&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I didnt run, I was at the bottom of the ladder, politely waiting for<br/>
&gt; &gt;someoen to say &quot;Carapace for loot, or Mask for loot&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Supposedly, I &quot;Stole&quot; The mask, and now im going to be blacklisted, my name<br/>
&gt; &gt;will mean nothing, no one will trust me. she start screaming out loud over<br/>
&gt; &gt;shout, saying no one should trust me, that I am &quot;an (insert colorful verb<br/>
&gt; &gt;here) loot thief. No matter what I said to her, , or over Shout. no one<br/>
&gt; &gt;would listen to me.(Lynriss was her name. Fibtik, Wokka, arthon where in<br/>
&gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt;group as well)<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am, and forever will be, an honorable man. Truthful, and Honest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I tell you now that I did not loot a mask=(<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am afraid that my name will be smeared all over the message boards, and<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt;the little black lists that some of the more anal people on my server<br/>
&gt; &gt;follow.(Mithaniel Marr)<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am asking you, as a friend. To please vouch for me, and defend me if you<br/>
&gt; &gt;hear or see anythign about me, as obviously, my word means nothing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I do thank Rann for helping as much as he could. Thank you all<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
