&gt; I noticed that even though Verant has finally given bards something we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; really wanted (meditate), that I got in this morning to a full inbox of people<br/>
&gt; griping about the fact that we don&#39;t &quot;surf&quot; anymore.  Boo hoo hoo.  It seems<br/>
&gt; some people aren&#39;t happy unless they have something to complain about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey!  I was complaining about them taking away surfing well before they actually did it!  They kept saying<br/>
they were going to &quot;fix&quot; it, and I&#39;ve been feedbacking it for a month saying I didn&#39;t want it to happen.<br/>
So I&#39;m allowed!  For those who care, don&#39;t get your hopes up that they&#39;ll take it out.  For them to go<br/>
through all the effort to fix it in the first place suggests that they really think that this graphic is a<br/>
lot better.  No accounting for taste, is there?<br/>

Meditation is very cool, btw.  Not so much for the death part, since it usually takes awhile for a rez<br/>
anyway, but more for the ability to switch songs during (and in between) combat.  In Sol B, if I wanted to<br/>
change my song list, and started to mem a new song just after one fight was done, we were often halfway<br/>
through the next fight before I could finish a single song remem.  That&#39;s going to be a lot better now.<br/>
