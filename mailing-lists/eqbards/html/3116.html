<div id="ygrps-yiv-644473091">Uhhh, you need to accept the unholy alliance between Bards, Druids, and your<br/>
party members. If the Druid has SoW&#39;d everyone, don&#39;t use Selos.  <br/>
<br/>
No amount of talking about how it is no mana burner, can be enhanced by<br/>
drum, etc etc will get it through their skulls. Also, SoW is not tied to the<br/>
proximity of the bard - so its prolly a better escape mechanism for party<br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
Selos will cancel their SoW&#39;s if you play it and they will get mad at you.<br/>
The icons stay on the screen but they wont be running fast.  Believe me -<br/>
our local druid just got SoW and he loves casting it on everyone and sitting<br/>
for 5 min to regen mana.  If I hit Selos - and sometimes I do by accident or<br/>
out of habit and cancel off their SoW&#39;s I might as well camp.<br/>
<br/>
Selos is a good transport thing for the whole party if they understand how<br/>
to make best use of it. IE: the bard runs behind everyone. SoW is good for<br/>
single players to dash about - making pulls etc.<br/>
<br/>
So finally I decided to un-mem it just so I don&#39;t hit it by accident.  And<br/>
the very next fight... boom Orc Oracle roots me!  I probably would have used<br/>
it to break the root at the cost of breaking their SoW&#39;s - its not like they<br/>
were gonna run off anywhere  - but instead there I stood rooted and<br/>
bellowing.<br/>

		Anyway, on a related note, apparently you&#39;re not supposed to<br/>
be able to do<br/>
		this, but in playing around we managed to stack SOW &<br/>
Accelerado.  The only<br/>
		time we could get it to work though was when Accelerado went<br/>
into the second<br/>
		space and SOW in the third.</div>
