 </span></blockquote>Tszaaz recently got one (at 35), I even got the kill! That was very<br/>
satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have been plotting (well actually they replaced the plotter with<br/>
a schemer, so mostly scheming) one for my Newbie project bard, here is what<br/>
I know mixed with some theory.<br/>
<br/>
On a busy night you can get to the bedroom and hang with the BR group<br/>
(making it more likely that you will get grieves). It is hard to see on the<br/>
maps but you have to *swim* to the BR, get that swimming up first, your life<br/>
will most likely depend on it. <br/>
<br/>
There is no possible way to continue without Invis and Invis to Undead. The<br/>
bats and skellies will eat your lunch. Your invis will probably not cut it<br/>
either, which means you are going to have to offer to buy both of those from<br/>
a tolerant cleric. Why tolerant? I think that folks near the zone get a bit<br/>
tired of newbies making runs for nodrop stuff. So you have to make it<br/>
something they WANT to do, which means money or (if you are lucky and a<br/>
showman) entertainment. Money is your best bet. With the price of potions<br/>
coming down Invis to Undead potions might be a good buy.<br/>
<br/>
Next, make SURE that the BR and ass sup (assassin/supplier) are very camped.<br/>
I poped up in the BR one night to see it empty of all but Undead<br/>
Frogluks...I have NO idea how at 6 and *swimming* I lived. Next, *wait* for<br/>
a camp check (people get SO tired of them that a beggar generating one will<br/>
not make you friends) and ask the person who replies &quot;ass sup&quot; if they would<br/>
mind you looting the mask. Drink your potions/get your spells and go. You<br/>
can&#39;t see on a map that it is up a ladder. <br/>
<br/>
Now, cower behind some barrels trying hard to look like an inanimate object.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that the group could get into trouble and evac. Also you could get<br/>
the mask and then no one in the group might want to or  be able to invis to<br/>
undead you. Both paths lead to dead bard with a terrible Corpse Retrieval<br/>
problem. Potions are starting to sound better and better. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you!<br/>
