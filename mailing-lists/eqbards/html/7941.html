<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029622342">EQ is like life in that yes, men like giving women stuff.  From what I&#39;ve<br/>
seen women like giving men stuff too so its no big deal.  In EQ its even<br/>
more prevalent cause a normally shy guy can give some woman a really cool<br/>
item and feel good without having to worry about being embarrassed by<br/>
others.  If only real life were more like that, a closer community.  ah<br/>
well.  I say wear away!  The twinkers that are generally frowned upon and<br/>
shunned are the ones decked out in tons of cool stuff like full rubicite or<br/>
with all great weapons and jewelry etc.  I have never seen any molested<br/>
because their character had one or two items way above their level.  Heck<br/>
due to some weird banking bug I awoke one day to find adamanitite Epolets in<br/>
my vault.  I wore them for a while and no one complained but eventually I<br/>
realized I could sell them and get about 6-8 really good peices of equipment<br/>
instead of one really bodacious piece.<br/>
<br/>
So do as you please and don&#39;t worry about the jealosy of others.  If it<br/>
happens it likely will regardless of how much more fortuante than them you<br/>
are, a little or a lot.  Also I doubt that having two really cool pieces of<br/>
equipment will leson your learning experience, just save you a few deaths<br/>
perhaps.<br/>

I will probably regret sending this mail .. Please remember this is my first<br/>
mail list and I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months now, so many of<br/>
these comcepts are still new to me (Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I<br/>
have read the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a very high level<br/>
player, I did not understand the EXP share problem. He just asked me to keep<br/>
singing my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with him for<br/>
several hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this he<br/>
said he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him I<br/>
needed exp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for me<br/>
and initiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and he<br/>
said yes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a<br/>
pair of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I could<br/>
see via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too good<br/>
for my level. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if I<br/>
should wear them/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with<br/>
twinking but dont want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an<br/>
opinion on what I should!<br/>
 do.<br/>
<br/>
Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>
<br/>
