&gt; they don&#39;t aggro on level 30&#39;s. Too bad, seems like such a good place for<br/>
&gt; exp and items at my level, but I can&#39;t make it to any of the good rooms. So<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll have to con everything and see if something is not indifferent to<br/>
&gt; you. Anything not indifferent will jump you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Nope, heh.  These little pricks still find it in their heart to attack<br/>
  me anytime they see me.  You will never be high enough level for these<br/>
  twerps not to attack, unfortunately.<br/>
