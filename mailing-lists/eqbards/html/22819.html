<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435209480">I had gone in and killed about 5 giants. Just those few were enough to make <br/>
them go from dubious to threateningly. I&#39;m just doing the lemming thing and <br/>
following what a couple of my friends are doing, which is to improve dwarf <br/>
and dragon faction. And I just have a natural urge to attack giants after <br/>
all the giant fighting I&#39;ve done in the past.<br/>

&gt;ya but question is... which is the most valuable to keep... dragon or dwarf<br/>
&gt;or giant.  I&#39;m assuming 2 out of 3 to keep.  I&#39;m just wondering if there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;way to raise factions without lowering the others,  but probably isnt<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Killing Giants raises dwarves and dragons, I aimagine killing dwarves would<br/>
&gt;raise giants and dragons but am not sure.  I also imagine that killing<br/>
&gt;dragons will raise dwarves and giants.  Seems like you basically choose one<br/>
&gt;faction to hurt out of the three.  Note that the minus faction hits are more<br/>
&gt;significant than the plus hits so you can&#39;t kill the same number of giants<br/>
&gt;and dwarves without expecting to be KoS to both.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;To you all that have been to Velious... Which factions are you watching out<br/>
&gt;for?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;from the little that I&#39;ve been/understand of it is that you kill 1 other 2<br/>
&gt;like you and so on<br/>
