I play in the 3rd person view, but pulled back just a bit from the initial <br/>
camera switch. When you pull back and then zoom back in, you find the view <br/>
will only return to showing yourself from about the knees up. The reason I <br/>
play this way is first person views trigger motion sickness. I have to avoid <br/>
games where first person is the only view. I do have to switch briefly to <br/>
first person for swimming in Kedge and that darn ladder out of the Mino <br/>
Elder pit in LG. As for keys, you don&#39;t want to know what I use as I got <br/>
used to some keys from Beta 3 and have never bothered to change my reflexes. <br/>
I twist songs with the mouse, as my hotkeys are mostly tied up with other <br/>
junk.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Made L46 last night in KK, and a big ole shark gave me a shiny new helm <br/>
for a present. =)<br/>
