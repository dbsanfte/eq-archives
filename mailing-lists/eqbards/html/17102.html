&gt; No one, and I mean no one, is better at down time reduction then we are. Ask<br/>
&gt; any player in, on any server, what they hate the most about the game and I<br/>
&gt; would bet a FBSS and a pair of yaks that downtime would be at the top of the<br/>
&gt; list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No argument there.  What&#39;s keeping me from playing my<br/>
enchanter is the downtime.  I also have a monk, but I just<br/>
bring him out when I had to camp in the planes.  He kills<br/>
something, then sits on his butt while I read a magazine<br/>
waiting for the word to come back.  :0<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Over-land Travel:<br/>
&gt; At lower levels group gating every where is just not an option.  We get fast<br/>
&gt; travel before any other class in the game.  And at upper levels we can out<br/>
&gt; run anything in the game.  Add to this that in the expansion there will be<br/>
&gt; zones twice as large as West Karana and that there is only going to be one<br/>
&gt; GG point and 2 boat docks on the new continent and this does becomes a<br/>
&gt; valuable addition.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I put up with this at lower levels, but at the higher<br/>
levels...  They really need to increase the range of this song<br/>
(yes I know they just increased it).  As it is right now, once<br/>
the song starts, someone can run out of range in about 0.4<br/>
seconds.  It is *impossible* for me to keep a group of 6 in<br/>
the song effect unless we all start off running at normal<br/>
speed, then I start the song.  If someone gets lagged, takes a<br/>
wrong turn, or chases a ghost for longer than 0.4 seconds,<br/>
they are out of range.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Overall:<br/>
&gt; I have said this numerous times, so I will say it again :)  The Bard class<br/>
&gt; is unique in the fact that we amplify the power of the party.  The large the<br/>
&gt; party the more powerful the bard becomes.  No other class and ramp up as<br/>
&gt; easily like this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, enchanters work like this too.<br/>
