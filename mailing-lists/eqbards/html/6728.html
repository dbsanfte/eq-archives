<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664672424">Yep, checked the site.  The one they list as halfling only is the one found<br/>
on halfling raiders in Nekutolus Forest and in Neriak.  Its listed as<br/>
seperate from the quest one.  Hopefully they only changed one of the two.<br/>

Well, my initial intention with the warning was based on info I found on<br/>
AllaKhazam&#39;s website and I sent out the warning not based on whether I can<br/>
verify the info, but more on a &quot;this info needs to be verified&quot; level<br/>
because I would hate to see you give away another dirk in vain.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the Order of Thunder medallion that was changed in the last<br/>
patch for example, we learned that there were two separate versions of the<br/>
medallion and I happened to have the one version with AC which was then<br/>
removed with the patch and then restored again the next day.  This leads me<br/>
to speculate that IF it is true that the raider&#39;s cap has been changed to<br/>
Halfling only, THEN it is likely that there may be 2 versions of it.  All<br/>
speculation - but we should verify with info from players who have the cap<br/>
now from before the patch and players who obtain it henceforth.<br/>

&gt; Do you mean that now only a halfling can complete the quest <br/>
&gt; and get the<br/>
&gt; reward or is the cap now only wearable by a halfling?  If its <br/>
&gt; the second<br/>
&gt; option, the non-halflings who already have one are getting hosed.<br/>

&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Careful with this quest Galtin, much like the new <br/>
&gt; bloodforge armor that<br/>
&gt; &gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; replaced the blackened as a reward for the ogre heads quest <br/>
&gt; in BB/Kaladim,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; hear that the raider cap is now Halfling only.<br/>
