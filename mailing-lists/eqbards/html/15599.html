<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558749788">Well - if this Razel character is in fact a &quot;good guy&quot; he could show it by<br/>
making amends.  IMHO - he has a<br/>
responsibility to rectify the situation.  IMHO - your character is your<br/>
character and if you let someone else play it - you are still responsible<br/>
for their actions.<br/>
<br/>
If this were to happen to me (and it won&#39;t I would NEVER allow someone else<br/>
to play my character) - I would do everything and I mean everything in my<br/>
power to replace the items including spending all my money and doing the<br/>
quests...<br/>

&gt; Well, I did report it and was told there was nothing that could be (or<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; be) done about the situation.  However, at the end of the night, the gm<br/>
&gt; finally asked that I write her an email explaining the situation.<br/>
Hopefully<br/>
&gt; that will help matters.<br/>
