&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Dex useless?<br/>
&gt;Date: Sun, 26 Dec 1999 15:02:54 +0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This was on EQVault. At one time I had 116 STR and 151 DEX and I still<br/>
&gt;missed alot. Dex didn&#39;t seem to improve my hitting ability at all. So<br/>
&gt;eventually I scrapped DEX altogether since I felt it was useless to a<br/>
&gt;bard, despite being a &quot;primary&quot; stat. I feel cheated to have given my<br/>
&gt;bard a starting dex of 90 but oh well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now DEX does add mana for a bard though right? I suppose this is true,<br/>
&gt;but I hardly get a chance to use dirge in the first place, seeing as how<br/>
&gt;whenever I get res&#39;d, all my mana zips to 0 and before I can regain 4<br/>
&gt;bars of it, I&#39;m dead/getting res&#39;d again. And yea, hunting in the planes<br/>
&gt;at 50, I die too often. Also, another thing about bard mana... I got<br/>
&gt;super drunk which dropped my int to 15, then sobered back up to where my<br/>
&gt;int was back to normal and I was missing a full bubble of mana. So int<br/>
&gt;definitely plays a part in our mana amount, but I have yet to confirm<br/>
&gt;dex or cha for doing so. I&#39;ll have to test that out.<br/>
&gt;So I&#39;d suggest you sacrifice dex for STR, unless you have a Proc&#39;ing<br/>
&gt;weapon in which it&#39;d be good to have some dex without totally killing<br/>
&gt;strength.<br/>
