<b>Subject:</b> Re: Which song for soloing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965654446">It totally depends on what you are fighting and when.<br/>
<br/>
For Soloing:<br/>
<br/>
When fighting monsters I could easily defeat, I would bellow nonstop (no <br/>
stacking).<br/>
<br/>
Around level 20-21, I started having a lot of problems fighting monsters that <br/>
were &quot;dangerous.&quot;  I began to twist healing and warsong, to 1) make me kill <br/>
faster<br/>
and 2) make me live longer.  When the mobs got down to 1/3 to 1/4 life, I&#39;d <br/>
switch to bellows and warsong (if my health was okay)<br/>
<br/>
For Partying:<br/>
<br/>
Melee:<br/>
I would take preferance to singing Anthem, and switch to healing (and step <br/>
back from the fight to avoid the shit list effect) with my mandolin.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting magic users:<br/>
I would sing/twist the rhythm songs (to boost resistances) and anthem.</div>
