<div id="ygrps-yiv-727165559">Actually I&#39;d have to say you were both right and wrong.  The bard died<br/>
because he was stupid.  I have fought Bracken Underbrush three times, and<br/>
killed him once at 15th level in a group of 3 like leveled people.  Bracken<br/>
SoW&#39;s himself so yes outrunning him is difficult, but that works to his<br/>
disadvantage.  What I did, and probably what the Bard should have done, is<br/>
run in a big circle dragging him behind me.  The wizard in my group would<br/>
nail him as we ran by as would the ranger with his bow, and then sit and med<br/>
while I ran twisting Bellow and Selo&#39;s.  Because the brownie never fell very<br/>
far behind he never escaped Bellow range.  I took about 4 bubbles of health<br/>
dragging him past our nuker like this, and twisted Bellow, Selo&#39;s and Hymn<br/>
for the last two bubbles to increase the brownies Aggro at me.  When the<br/>
wizard nuked him down to about 10% of his health on the last pass, I stopped<br/>
and the ranger and I smacked the heck out of him.<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing you could have done except suggest they flee, Bracken is<br/>
way too tough to toe to toe with even if he was a blue.  He hits very hard,<br/>
his spells hit hard, and he has a lot of hits.  He is a classic example of a<br/>
bad /con, much like Dorn or D&#39;vinn.<br/>
<br/>
You took the best option, stick around in case you could help, flee with<br/>
your life if you could not.  I bet the caster wasn&#39;t cursing your name!<br/>

I had a disturbing situation happen the other day.  I was sharing the<br/>
sisters bandit camp in Lesser fay with a group of 3 others.  All of the<br/>
other players were 15-16 level and in a group, and consisted of a Ranger,<br/>
Bard, and a Magician.  At the time I was 15th level and am quite capable of<br/>
soloing the camp while alone, so I wasen&#39;t milking off them.  We had a good<br/>
thing going and were being very friendly to one another untill something odd<br/>
happend.<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting for my spawn, when I heared the sounds of battle behind me.  I<br/>
figured that they were killing a giant spider or somthing in between spawns<br/>
as I often do.  But something didn&#39;t sound right.  I turned around to see<br/>
the 16th level Bard and the 15th level Ranger, attacking a named Brownie.<br/>
My jaw dropped as I asessed the situation.  The brownie was hardly hit at<br/>
all and the two where below half health already.  Now was my time for snap<br/>
deciscions.  Should I help out, or should I bug out.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew that they would die if they stayed, but I thought that the 16th bard<br/>
would kick in Selo&#39;s and run for the zone pulling the little nasty with him<br/>
and saving the party.  Thats what I would do.  Well I waited and the spell<br/>
caster managed to get off some big spells taking its health down about a<br/>
quarter, just as the Bard and the Ranger dropped.  By this time I had my<br/>
drum in hand and Selo&#39;s playing, I whacked the Brownie and headed for the<br/>
Greater Fay zone.  Much to my surprise, I could not out-run him by much, and<br/>
he stayed on my tail all the way to the zone, where I got out with a sliver<br/>
of life.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m feeling pretty good at this point, because I managed to save the<br/>
Spell Caster.  But as I&#39;m healing in the entrance to the lesser fay, the<br/>
Bard who died came up and started bitching me out for not helping.  I told<br/>
him that he was dead from the first hit, and asked him why he did not Selo<br/>
out for the zone with his party, but that just made him more mad.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up stopping for the night to try think of anything I could have done<br/>
better, it all happend so fast.  Any suggestions?<br/>
