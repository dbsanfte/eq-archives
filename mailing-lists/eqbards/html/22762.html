<div id="ygrps-yiv-82164286">Congrats on the ding.  My finger wiggling guild brother Rhube was fighting in the caves there last night and told me about the claws.  He&#39;s pretty sure I&#39;d like them too.  He said the bear pelts they were getting actually had stats on the pelts when you looted them.  Thanks for the updates.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hmmm, orcs sound interesting too.  Might have to go there.  <br/>
<br/>
Me and some guild brothers found a nice spot in the Great Divide.  Actually<br/>
a few nice spots, but this one we stayed at the most.  There are some caves<br/>
with bears in them at about neg 6000, pos 2400ish if I remember the loc<br/>
correctly.  There are a few cave openings for multiple camp spots.  A little<br/>
ways up the mountain from the caves is the Labrynth Dungeon.  Outside the<br/>
caves are wurms of various types.  Lots of mobs.  Got a Velium Spear off a<br/>
wurm and got claws off the bears, not much if any coin.  There are two named<br/>
bears:  Icetooth and Bloodmaw.  I heard via ooc that Bloodmaw is a major<br/>
miscon and he was tough to the groups attacking, but no personal experience,<br/>
so beware.  Icetooth we did see and kill.  He was white and then blue to me<br/>
at 38.  We had broken the cave and were keeping the spawn under control<br/>
without problem.  If we got two, shaman rooted or I charmed or we used druid<br/>
harmony pull - not a problem.  If had a lull in our room, we simply walked<br/>
back out a little and pulled one in.  But back to Icetooth - he dropped a<br/>
better claw 11 damage, 29 delay, Magic lore, primary only.  I like it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
General impression:  I really like it a lot and am having fun.  Just not<br/>
getting enough sleep this week.  Hehe.<br/>

Actually, those necklaces are pretty common.  I&#39;ve seen 5 or 6 of them<br/>
already.<br/>
I keep having to pass<br/>
them around to people since they&#39;re lore.<br/>
The earrings drop off about 1 of every 15 orcs (can drop off the oracle,<br/>
centurion or mystic).  The necklace<br/>
can also drop off the oracle or mystic.  The centurions can only drop the<br/>
earrings.<br/>
The Oracle also drops the Ry`gorr armor.  At least the boots, bracer,<br/>
sleeves,<br/>
coif and collar (that&#39;s what<br/>
we&#39;ve seen so far at least)..   It looks VERY VERY cool on a bard.  It looks<br/>
like the old Hot Rod symbol.<br/>
It&#39;s a flame that covers the chest and goes down through the legs.  Probably<br/>
the<br/>
best looking bard armor<br/>
I&#39;ve seen yet.  To get the BP and Legs, however, you have to go kill the<br/>
Chieftain (named mob) that spawns<br/>
at the Rygorr Fort in the middle of the zone.<br/>

Ladt night while camping the orc oracle in Eastern Wastes (near the bridge),<br/>
we had 3 of those nifty earrings drop (we were pulling cougars, griffs, etc)<br/>
and a *very* rare drop from the oracle, a necklace that was like AC 8 (or<br/>
was it AC 5?  Think it was 8), +3 str, and +2 dex.<br/>
<br/>
Loot is nice and randomized :o)<br/>
<br/>
Will prolly strike out on my own tonight (just under a bub and a half from<br/>
level) and try charm-kiting those roaming giants ;o)<br/>
