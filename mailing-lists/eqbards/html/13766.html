&gt; Problem is I am one of the main tanks for my group about 50% of the time.<br/>

&gt; ranger.  Also backing off does no good.  Unless the mob is rooted they<br/>
&gt; follow me around like puppies wherever I go.  This makes it more difficult<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll repeat:  This problem is pretty bad around your level but<br/>
starts to go away as you approach your mid 20s and 30s.  Last<br/>
night I was hunting hill giants with some friends (the<br/>
straight melee approach).  Occasionally a giant would start to<br/>
beat on me.  If I backed off and shut off my songs, my friends<br/>
could get it off me within one or two rounds.  I could then<br/>
start my songs and attacks and get in maybe 10 rounds of<br/>
attacks before I had to repeat it.<br/>
<br/>
I only contributed to the bard hatred thread because it&#39;s<br/>
still way out of line for the amount of benefit we bring to a<br/>
party, and Abashi&#39;s original comments were either ignorant or<br/>
insulting.<br/>
