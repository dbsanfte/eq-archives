Gordon has posted about this issue and his story is that the trainers and<br/>
merchants who are there were only put there for the beta testers - who could<br/>
not leave the zone during the test.  He says they merely forgot to take them<br/>
out but are gonna leave them there but not add any more of them.  He says<br/>
they wanted Kunark to be a place that would require you to have needs to<br/>
return to the other continents - not be a fully populated place that you<br/>
would not ever have to leave. Anyways, that&#39;s his story.<br/>

p.s. I have this stone bridge in North Karana - for sale really cheap!  You<br/>
can charge ppl to cross it and make your money back in no time at all!<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. Jacana, and all others on Inny, feel free to /tell me if you need<br/>
some transport.  If I am not too busy, I can usually have my wizard on the<br/>
2nd PC teleport.  He&#39;s only 31 so it&#39;s one-way from FV to North K, Tox or<br/>
Ghetto Faydark.<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s.s.  He (my 31 wiz) was standing on the FV bridge one day - on the side<br/>
near the merchants and such.  I hear this noise of a fight and glance at the<br/>
other screen and see the guards telling something that they dont tolerate<br/>
foul creatures, etc. etc.  So, I wonder who trained a spider all the way to<br/>
the bridge and dont pay any attention.  A moment later, I hear my wiz<br/>
getting attacked!  So now I look and see the Ancient Jarsath hitting him for<br/>
110.  Ouch!  While he fumbles for yonder or gate, the AJ kills him and then<br/>
I realize that he was standing at his *bind point* !!!!  So, I power off the<br/>
PC and hope for the best.  When I got back on, he only took one death -<br/>
thankfully!  But the AJ somehow chewed his way past all four bridge guards<br/>
and I guess one of the patrolling scouts finally took him out.  There were<br/>
half a dozen or so pc corpses strewn along the bridge.<br/>

&gt; Just curious - are bards the only guild that do not have a trainer there?<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; saw many other trainers along the way and even someone to sell songs....<br/>
