<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-811569958">it almost got me killed for the same reasons in Burning Woods.  this song is<br/>
not for fighting and definitely NOT for escape, especially against casters.<br/>
every time i would finally get it to pulse, blam i get hit by a spell and it<br/>
falls, because of the invisibility effect.  for this same reason, niv&#39;s<br/>
melody and nillipus&#39; march drop because they have a rune effect.  as soon as<br/>
it&#39;s exceeded (which is one hit from these mobs) the whole effect drops.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Last night, I was tracking and pulling in Trakanons. At first <br/>
&gt; was using my Selos drum and out running the mobs thus losing <br/>
&gt; them. So I switched to weps and was slow enough but noticed something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you get attacked or attack something, while playing SSoT <br/>
&gt; (song of travel), the effect drops immediately. And you have <br/>
&gt; to re-key it to get going again. It looks like it will be <br/>
&gt; un-workable for fighting mobs if it drops as soon as you key <br/>
&gt; anything else. </span></blockquote></div>
