<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741400623">only once since i got this song has it actually helped.  we still all died,<br/>
but it allowed us to get the yak from the lord before we were all gone.  it<br/>
was actually that close that the 325dmg helped (3 clerics, 2 warriors, and<br/>
me and only one warrior and me left alive).  the other thing i use it for is<br/>
duels.  big deal it wasn&#39;t put in the game for duels, but i use it every<br/>
time and i must say i love using it for the kill shot.  whoever i duels<br/>
always knows it&#39;s coming cause either they are feared away right before or i<br/>
am running away so i don&#39;t kill myself.  other than duels though, i have<br/>
memmed it maybe once in 6 months, and vox resisted it anyway.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; However, IMO, it was still a waste of <br/>
&gt; time because<br/>
&gt; as others have pointed out, the song is way underpowered for <br/>
&gt; the hassle<br/>
&gt; it involves. They may as well have made the song make the <br/>
&gt; bard blow up,<br/>
&gt; killing everything around him, for all the good it usually does. </span></blockquote></div>
