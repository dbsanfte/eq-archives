<div id="ygrps-yiv-528346014">This has been discussed on the rangers list, the person who came up with a<br/>
winning plan is active there.<br/>
<br/>
They send in warriors & rouges with the riposte discipline active so he<br/>
doesn&#39;t get a actual hit in, wizards stand back and hit him with the lure<br/>
line of spells. My understanding is he goes down quick.<br/>

  Subject: [eqbards] Well, to liven things up, have two questions...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  1.  Can anyone give me some information on the crowd control capabilities<br/>
  of classes other than Enchanters and Bards?  Have any of you developed<br/>
  any crown control techniques that let you handle oh, say, 5-MOB pulls?<br/>
  I&#39;m really sick to death of hearing &quot;we can&#39;t do that, we have no<br/>
  Enchanter&quot;.  Really sick of it.<br/>
<br/>
  2.  My guild is toying with the idea of trying Venril Sathir.  I<br/>
  understand he has a single-target 1500 point lifetap (repeatable), and<br/>
  does 350 or so damage a pop.  The two techniques I&#39;ve seen suggested are:<br/>
  1) chain Rune3ing (new word) the tanks, so the lifetap can&#39;t get them;<br/>
  and 2) chain nuking with a big battery of wizards (my suggestion was to<br/>
  have a Ranger tanking VS, with all the Clerics chain healing him - should<br/>
  be able to keep the guy aggroed enough to allow everyone else to remain<br/>
  untouched, don&#39;t you think?)  (slight cynicism here)  My question is,<br/>
  does anyone know if poison resist helps against this lifetap the way it<br/>
  does against Maestro?  It is reported to be &quot;unresistable&quot;, which I<br/>
  suppose is possible, but it may just appear that way because most<br/>
  people&#39;s poison resist is pretty low.  Anyone know?<br/>
