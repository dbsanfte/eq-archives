<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837230271">i love love love shaman!  almost always grouped with one.  nothing compares<br/>
to their slow spells and buffs.  because of a shaman we were even allowed to<br/>
camp in sebilis where we normally would not without a cleric.  shaman and<br/>
druid for sup heals with shaman slow was enough.  then you have that shaman<br/>
with a jaundiced bracer and forget the DoTs and let them nuke.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Was wondering about the shaman :P<br/>
&gt; Yeah shaman are in a similar role after level 50ish.. almost always<br/>
&gt; defensive<br/>
&gt; yet for the life of me you can&#39;t get some shaman to stop dotting and<br/>
&gt; meleeing<br/>
&gt; its insane cuz the non-efficient dot takes 7 ticks and the <br/>
&gt; efficient one 2<br/>
&gt; mins..  in full groups they are such a waste of mana its <br/>
&gt; unbelievable... </span></blockquote></div>
