<div id="ygrps-yiv-909810826"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; There is another way of getting on the rooftops that<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t include an exploit. I can assure you that if<br/>
&gt; &gt; a GM approaches you and asks how you got up there, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; you tell him either of these ways you won&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; &gt; banned or scolded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think what he meant was that there&#39;s a safe-kill spot up<br/>
&gt; there (one of those places where you can kill NPCs but NPCs<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t attack you), and if a GM sees you up there he&#39;ll assume<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re using it and ban you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, ok. Being unfamiliar with any exploits usable by<br/>
being up on the walls, and honestly never haven given<br/>
it any thought, I wasn&#39;t familiar with what might be<br/>
able to be done..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still fairly sure that a GM would observe you for<br/>
a short time before banning you. If you are indeed using<br/>
the exploit, then you deserve to be banned. But I don&#39;t<br/>
believe they&#39;d ban you just for being there without seeing<br/>
you do anything wrong. (There&#39;s regularly people on the<br/>
rooftops around the Veeshan Freeport bank..)</div>
