&gt;The dark elf was stupid.  Smiting you was a total waste of his mana unless<br/>
&gt;his smites alone could kill you which he should have known they could not.<br/>
&gt;Try that against a dwarf cleric who knows waht he&#39;s doing and you will die.<br/>
&gt;especially now that he can root you and you can&#39;t interrupt his healing <br/>
&gt;when<br/>
&gt;he backs away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My problem is the dwarf cleric in our group, same level as me, has 20% more<br/>
&gt;hit points than I do and a better AC.  He has stamina and strength over 100<br/>
&gt;and an agility and dex of 90 something or near to it.  He can mop the floor<br/>
&gt;with me in melee despite my having 18 pts more weapon skill than him.  If <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt;heals himself it would be even more of a joke.  The last time we dueled he<br/>
&gt;was the one left with two bubbles while I was near death.  Thank goodness<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s on my side is all I have to say!  If he was a dwarf Paladin it would <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;even more laughable, I doubt he would drop below 3 bubbles.  His dwarf<br/>
&gt;paladin that is 5 levels below me has more hp than I do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the main problem is that while Verant originally intended a high<br/>
&gt;agility to compensate for low hit points that the lower stamina gives you,<br/>
&gt;they got burned by someone with super-agility being unhittable and reduced<br/>
&gt;the agility benefit.  My sole saving grace is I get hit less often than he<br/>
&gt;does even with a worse AC because I dodge more, even though our dodge skill<br/>
&gt;is only 5 points different.  Now if they gave wood elves a defense bonus to<br/>
&gt;compensate for the low hit points maybe it would even out, but right now I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t do enough more damage, even with dual wield, to account for his<br/>
&gt;greater hit points.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Blah, he rooted me and i broke it every time with Selo&#39;s (this was a few <br/>
months ago). Anyways the smiting and his use of mana is NOT what i was <br/>
talking about. I was talking about Bard and Cleric melee. I RAPED him in <br/>
melee, with me at 40% health and him at full in the beginning of the melee. <br/>
Give me a non-twinked 20th level bard with 2 combine long swords and full <br/>
banded (which sounds about right to me at that level), and MELEE a cleric of <br/>
any race and I bet the bard will win...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 47th level and no cleric on my server would ever DREAM of winning <br/>
against me in straight melee. &lt;And no, i&#39;m not trying to glorify bard melee <br/>
- we suck at it and i am not afraid to admit it&gt;.  =)<br/>
