<div id="ygrps-yiv-374652773"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The type of armor does make a difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The difference between leather and plate<br/>
&gt; was like night and day, and in my <br/>
&gt; opinion still is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But is it different because of the AC # difference, or because of the<br/>
material the armor is made from? ie: If a piece of plate has an AC of say 5<br/>
and a piece of Mesh had an AC of 5 as well, would there be a difference? <br/>
<br/>
The question is whether the AC# makes the difference or the material makes<br/>
the difference.</div>
