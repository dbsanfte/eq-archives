<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948192269">Are you talking about 50+ mobs? If so, it&#39;s fairly simple: to a 50th a <br/>
yellow con mob is level 51 or 52, anything else beyond that is an educated <br/>
guess. I used to think there was a hard level cap on affecting red mobs with <br/>
spells with my druid, like maybe anything 6 levels above you will 100% <br/>
resist all of your spells. I thought people were maybe trying to figure mob <br/>
levels out using that logic. That was until I found myself nuking a 49th <br/>
level shark at lvl 37.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;	Hrm, this brings up an interesting question for myself.  If the<br/>
&gt;old bard charm wasn&#39;t capped, how did my guildmates know what level<br/>
&gt;certain mobs were...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;thinks there&#39;s some showeq stuff going on&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	In any case the point is moot, since bards can&#39;t charm anything in<br/>
&gt;sky anymore, except for maybe npc pets.<br/>
