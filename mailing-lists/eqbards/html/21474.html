<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616471027">What?  According to Verant&#39;s own definitions all Melee classes have Dual<br/>
Wield.<br/>
In fact, of melee and hybrid&#39;s only Paladins and Shadowknights don&#39;t have<br/>
dual wield.  This is a totally bogus excuse for changing this spell.  This<br/>
is another in a long line of ridiculous comments from VI.  When was the last<br/>
time you heard somebody at level 50+ desire a ranger in a group over a<br/>
paladin?<br/>
<br/>
After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>
of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s <br/>
current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>
desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>
duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>
value decreased.</div>
