<b>Subject:</b> Bard Petition <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382847510">I read a post about starting back up the bard petition.  I for one do not<br/>
like petitions but for some strange reason that seems to be the way to get<br/>
things fixed with this game.  So I wrote the original writer of the Bard<br/>
petition and he wrote me back saying &quot;If you rally some people to make new<br/>
comments, I will overhaul it and submit it to Brad&quot;.  The ball is in our<br/>
court so I was hoping to see a bunch of new comments on things we would like<br/>
to have fixed or changed with the class.<br/>
<br/>
On a personal note my Bard character is my favorite to play, and believe it<br/>
or not on the Magician mailing list everyone there complained a lot more<br/>
about there class.  I have to say though that my Mage character was a lot<br/>
more balanced than my bard.  And yet they keep helping the Mages out by<br/>
fixing their complaints.  Maybe the squeaky wheel does get oil.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions:  As my bard is still new I can offer only a few ideas to get<br/>
the ball rolling.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  My idea is<br/>
change the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to me (Stats<br/>
might be the factor) to be the better song to use over Warsong and Anthem.<br/>
I have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, there should be<br/>
no debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>
2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>
3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rouges<br/>
do.<br/>
4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand<br/>
point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a<br/>
coin.<br/>
5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was not using a<br/>
crossbow or bow?<br/>
6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only weapons that can be<br/>
used as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of<br/>
singing songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a lot of ideas<br/>
here would help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this gets the ball rolling and as viewed as a constructive way to<br/>
help solve some bard issues.<br/>
<br/>
Fair thee well friends!</div>
