<b>Subject:</b> Mistress of Scorn - Spoiler! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-117602081">Hi all!  Last night I went up to Hate for the first time in months <br/>
(took a break).  Coincidentally, this was the first time for our <br/>
alliance since the upgrade.  I had read a little about the new boss <br/>
mobs that now drop the old Innoruuk loot and noticed a Mistress of <br/>
Scorn on track.  Track by the way was jam packed due to so many new <br/>
mobs.  Anyway, she was one of the first boss mobs that we took down <br/>
and she dropped Dawnchaser, Imbrued Gloves, and Imbrued Boots.  With <br/>
the mistress in the mix, bard drops were excellent compaired to <br/>
previous trips.  On top of those three items, Imbrued helm, Martune <br/>
Rapier, and Six Note Blade all dropped.  Bringing the total that I <br/>
saw up to 6 drops instead of the usual 1-3 that I would see <br/>
previously.  There were also 2 scorns left on track when I camped, so <br/>
I don&#39;t know what else may have dropped.  But for those of you that <br/>
haven&#39;t gotten all of your Hate gear, this upgrade makes things a lot <br/>
easier!  I got 4 things that I needed and an extra set of gloves last <br/>
night!  Let the Martune rot, I hate those things :p<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one more spoiler about the second floor.... we got agro&#39;d on <br/>
the second floor a lot.  The nice thing is that the mobs won&#39;t come <br/>
downstairs; bad thing is that they will HT through the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck hunting!<br/>
