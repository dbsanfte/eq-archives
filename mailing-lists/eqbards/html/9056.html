&quot;Not really an article but at least some humor I wrote/edited this for <br/>
amusement. It is sung to Mambo No. 5 by LouBega.<br/>
It is Titled Character No. 5&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and Gentlemen<br/>
This is character number 5<br/>
One, two, three, four five<br/>
When your twinked in the game, the levels seem to fly<br/>
I want to be in Guk - right now, not later<br/>
The group says they want to hunt some orcs<br/>
But I really don&#39;t wanna<br/>
Big trains, that I caused last week<br/>
I must get levels<br/>
At least 10 a week<br/>
I like paladins, enchanters, rangers and wizards<br/>
And as I continue, you know<br/>
They &#39;re getting sweeter<br/>
Why cant I twink my multi char - I&#39;m really bored<br/>
To me camping, its just like a sport, anything rare<br/>
If its good let me twink it<br/>
Give it away, don&#39;t even think it.<br/>
REFRAIN<br/>
A little bit of armor on the side<br/>
A little bit of platinum is alright<br/>
A little bit of rubi is all I need<br/>
A little bit of fun, I&#39;m level three<br/>
A pair of Ykeshas, is so much fun<br/>
I&#39;m killing lots of bats, all night long<br/>
I want to go to Crushbone, but of course<br/>
30 minutes, and I lose my corpse<br/>
Character No. 5<br/>
Level up real fast, gonna move all around<br/>
Don&#39;t die &#39;til you&#39;re bound<br/>
Killing spectres to the ground<br/>
Rubi on the chest<br/>
Crafted on the arms<br/>
Bladestorm in the hands and nothing harms<br/>
Bash the mob once<br/>
Proc the sword twice<br/>
Wow being level 10<br/>
Is really very nice.<br/>
REFRAIN<br/>
Twink it<br/>
Yeah twink it<br/>
Character no. 5<br/>
REFRAIN</div>
