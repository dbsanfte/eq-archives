<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499022746">Nope no duels or other shenanigans.  He was able to invite me as a regular<br/>
member just not as an officer, so it wasn&#39;t that npc thing, which I have<br/>
seen.  I did try going to the desktop, no luck.  Another great mystery of<br/>
Verant coding it appears.<br/>

Did you, or had you, duel in that zone?  Did you try logging out and back<br/>
into the game?  If you were in a duel that will sometimes cause your client<br/>
to act oddly.  Sometimes being charmed or feared will do it too.  Basically<br/>
the client thinks you&#39;re an NPC (or gets messed up in other ways.  Kinda<br/>
like the group bugs we hit from time to time).<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, try logging out and back in if that happens.  That SHOULD fix<br/>
it (all the way to windows, not just to char select).<br/>

&gt; We tried both.  He would target me and still use my name in the command.<br/>
&gt; That format worked to make the other three members into officers, only I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; unable to be added.  Kitasi is a founding officer already, its my wizard<br/>
&gt; Leagnomo that&#39;s unable to become an officer strangely.  Maybe its names<br/>
&gt; ending in o...<br/>

&gt; &gt;I had an unusual thing happen last nite.  Our guild leader was trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt;make my wizard an officer in the guild and could not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was he targetting you an issuing /guildinvite o, or were you just in the<br/>
&gt; same zone with him typing out /guildinvite o kitari?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About 90% of the time, I can just use the individual&#39;s name from anywhere<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the zone, but the other 10% of the time I actually have to target them.<br/>
