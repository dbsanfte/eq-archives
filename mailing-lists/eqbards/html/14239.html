<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-785143319">I did another test last night, just to be sure how bad the nerfing of<br/>
Lullaby really was, and to have a baseline to test against this patch to see<br/>
if anything changes.  I had the following results vs my West Freeport test<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
Tester:  		Bard lvl 21 (again)<br/>
Test Subject:	W Freeport snake lvl 1<br/>
Level difference:	20!<br/>
<br/>
Number of times song pulsed:<br/>
<br/>
Without Mandolin:		345<br/>
With Mandolin:		218<br/>
<br/>
Number of Total Resists:<br/>
<br/>
Without Mandolin:		19		Pct: <br/>
With Mandolin:		12<br/>
<br/>
Number of Secondary Resists:<br/>
<br/>
Without Mandolin:		127		Pct: 38.9%!!!<br/>
With Mandolin:		75		Pct: 36.4%!!!<br/>
<br/>
Total Resist Pct:		41.4%!!!<br/>
<br/>
Total Number of Attacks that would occur without Lullaby:	1126<br/>
Total Number of Attacks that did occur:				439<br/>
Percentage of Attacks stopped:					61%<br/>
<br/>
This is at Charisma 133, dex 115.<br/>
<br/>
This makes the song pretty useless.  Even though it stopped 61% of the<br/>
attacks, that&#39;s pretty pointless vs an opponent that&#39;s near the minimum<br/>
resist point.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I can&#39;t survive long enough versus a white/black to get a good<br/>
test vs an even opponent.  The one test I did do with a cleric healing me<br/>
had the following result.<br/>
<br/>
Pulses:		 61<br/>
Total Resists:	 13<br/>
Secondary Resists: 33<br/>
Successful Nods:	 15  That&#39;s only 25% success rate vs even con.  Test<br/>
is too small to be very accurate but this number is so bad that even this<br/>
small test shows it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I can get someone to duel me and try that I do have a possible<br/>
guildmate who might be on this weekend.<br/>

Its so sad.  I am a half-elf bard on E&#39;ci who started in Qeynos and spent<br/>
the first 8 levels between Quenos and Blackburrow, a lot of time in<br/>
BlackBurrow.  Not only do these pictures bring back bittersweet memories of<br/>
my younger years, I remember when Lullabye was useful too.  I also remember<br/>
when they changed it so that it would only affect at most 4 mobs instead of<br/>
as many as were in the song radius.  Ahhh the good old days.<br/>

&gt;   I was roaming around the net and I found these old pictures Sylly<br/>
&gt;   took.  I have some of my own, but these show the outside <br/>
&gt; perspective.<br/>

&gt;   I think I was L19 in these pictures.  Full bronze which I worked<br/>
&gt;   my ass of for from the first wave of L50s on Innoruuk.  This is<br/>
&gt;   when a bronze bp would run about 75-100pp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I put over 20 gnolls to sleep, ranging from scrawny to elite.<br/>
&gt;   I lost maybe 2 or 3 bubbles of health for the 2 or 3 mins I stood<br/>
&gt;   there holding them still.  That&#39;s right, completely still.  Hardly<br/>
&gt;   anything attacked me, they stayed asleep until I stopped playing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   This is how it used to be.  Verant (and GZ) blatantly lied that<br/>
&gt;   they haven&#39;t adjusted this song since release.  I tried to sleep<br/>
&gt;   off a few skeletons yesterday and I could not keep the group <br/>
&gt;   controlled at all.  The programmers didn&#39;t just put in the failed<br/>
&gt;   to mesmerize message, about 4 or 5 months ago they definitely F&#39;d<br/>
&gt;   this song.<br/>
