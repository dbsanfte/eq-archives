<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555487195">When I first acquired the dual wield skill, I used it for a while, but <br/>
found myself taking a huge amount of damage and often having to zone in the <br/>
middle of a battle.  So I switched back to using a shield for several <br/>
levels.  Later, when I had better weapons, more armor, and a higher defense <br/>
skill, I went back to the two weapon approach.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot depends on the party mix.  In a caster-heavy group, the <br/>
monsters will be beating on you a lot and the amount of extra damage you <br/>
can do with the second weapon is small compared to the nuking that&#39;s going <br/>
on -- your primary job is just to soak up some hits and provide utility <br/>
songs (especially, if you&#39;re 32nd level or above, to act as a mana <br/>
battery).  So you&#39;re probably better off with the shield.  In a tank-heavy <br/>
group, if the tanks are good, they&#39;ll keep the monsters from pigpiling you <br/>
and you won&#39;t be hit much.  In that case, by all means, go for the extra <br/>
damage from the second weapon.  At very high levels, you&#39;ll have access to <br/>
various nifty magical weapons that definitely outweigh the benefits of a <br/>
shield.<br/>

various dungeons to equip my whole guild with elf skin gloves, so I feel no <br/>
guilt about wearing them.  ;)  (Though we did get into a discussion about <br/>
the quality of pelt needed to make gloves...mine would tend to fall into <br/>
the &quot;ruined&quot; category, being generally riddled with claw holes, scorched, <br/>
frozen, etc...)<br/>
