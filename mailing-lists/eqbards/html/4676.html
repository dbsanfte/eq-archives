&gt;Instrument always goes in second melee slot, but you can never put anything<br/>
&gt;in the first melee slot with the instrument.  You have 4 options, sing and<br/>
&gt;fight with weapons, stand back and play instruments, a combination of the <br/>
&gt;2,<br/>
&gt;or play instruments and punch with your fists for about 1-5 damage a round.<br/>

his throwing slot - it looked like he was dual wielding them. He wasn&#39;t even <br/>
high enough to dual wield =)<br/>
