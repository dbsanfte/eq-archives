&gt; I probably shouldn&#39;t start this but....  I know many argue that all classes<br/>

&gt; And Bards are kind of left out of the loop even more being the most hybrid<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your two paragraphs are contradictory.  First you&#39;re upset<br/>
that a class that couldn&#39;t use an item won it.  Next you&#39;re<br/>
upset when a group tries to give the item to the classes that<br/>
can best use it.<br/>
<br/>
Each method of distribution (everyone has an equal chance,<br/>
those how need it/will use it have priority) has drawbacks.  <br/>
In a guild setting, these can be mitigated because you know<br/>
the others will keep track of the long-term history of item<br/>
awards.  You don&#39;t have that flexibility in pickup-groups.  <br/>
The best you can do is ask beforehand what the loot<br/>
distribution scheme is going to be.  If you don&#39;t like it,<br/>
leave.<br/>
