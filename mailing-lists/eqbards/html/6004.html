<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665401356">With regards to the Staff of Writhing... I have one and they dont work til<br/>
lvl 28+. I was &quot;given&quot; one at lvl 26 and it didnt work so I returned it :) I<br/>
have had my current one since 32 with no problems at all. Also the nice new<br/>
toy I have, the Orb of Tishan has Not  gone off for me yet ( BOO HOO)  but<br/>
it does bash for up to 32 points of damage...as soon as it DOES work I will<br/>
post the results.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;finally got to see a Writhing Staff in a trade window to investigate.<br/>
&gt;Nice weapon, but the fellow bard told me that unless you are level 28+,<br/>
&gt;the spell effect of the Writhing Staff won&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone confirm/deny/poke me ?<br/>
