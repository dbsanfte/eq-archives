&gt; &gt; Now, with that said, I&#39;m coming to regret my decision to<br/>
&gt; &gt; map the most commonly used letter in the English alphabet<br/>
&gt; &gt; (E) to be my attack key.  I have to be extremely cautious<br/>
&gt; &gt; when conversing with NPCs that I have the text entry<br/>
&gt; &gt; window up before blasting out a string of text.  Many<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I remapped mine to caps lock.  Aside from EQ, I don&#39;t think I<br/>
&gt; ever use that key.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot of people I know had it mapped to the ` key back in beta. This is<br/>
a great place for it because it&#39;s a rarely used key and right beside all<br/>
the rest of your hotkeys. It was screwed up for a while due to Verant&#39;s<br/>
arbitrary mapping of the transparency toggle to it but they recently<br/>
allowed that to be remapped so you can use it again. Of course I use the<br/>
wasd keys for movement so this is even more convenient. Because I was<br/>
used to UO where talking didnt require hitting return, the first thing I<br/>
did in EQ was move every configurable key off the letter keys. After<br/>
attacking a shopkeeper of course. :)<br/>
