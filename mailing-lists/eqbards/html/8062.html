<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565235385">Interesting... I have a question that some of you might be able to answer.<br/>
In a lot of zones there are some really cool &quot;ambient&quot; sounds (animals,<br/>
wind, etc).  However, in order for me to actually hear them, I have to have<br/>
my sound cranked really high - during a combat it&#39;s almost deafening.  Is<br/>
there a way to increase the ambient sounds w/o sending my combat sounds<br/>
through the roof??<br/>

I discovered an aspect of EQ that I was completely unaware of until<br/>
recently.  I have been playing since April and during that entire time I had<br/>
all the sound effect related options set to the max.  There are three sound<br/>
related options: Sound Realism, Music Volume and Sound Volume.  During this<br/>
timeframe, the only sound effects that I ever heard were combat/spell<br/>
effects and background music that you hear when you pass through specific<br/>
areas, such as near a city or a zone border.  I have recently been<br/>
adventuring in the aviak village in South Karana.  While you are in this<br/>
village, the background music plays continuously.  This eventually became<br/>
annoying to me so I went into the sound options screen and moved the sliding<br/>
bar that controlls music volume down to about 25%.  This had a profound<br/>
impact on the sound effects in the game.  Soon, I heard a female monk shriek<br/>
as she practiced feign death.  I heard aviaks shriek as they entered into<br/>
combat.  While running through SK, I heard the rumble of elephants walking<br/>
as well as their distinct bellow (really cool sounding with a SBLive).  I<br/>
also started hearing my own footsteps.  <br/>
<br/>
I assume that, because I had all of my sound related options set to the max,<br/>
the Sound Realism effects were getting cancelled out somehow.  I&#39;m looking<br/>
forward to going through regions long ago explored to see what special sound<br/>
effects I have previously missed. <br/>
<br/>
This may be old news for some of you but wanted to post this info n in case<br/>
other people are like me and were unaware of this option.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, according to the Creative labs website, there is a preset<br/>
Environment Audio setting for EQ for the SBLive soundcard.  I have been<br/>
unable to locate this setting.  I have been using the default Multi Speaker<br/>
setting for my soundcard.  Does anyone know if an Environmental Audio<br/>
setting for EQ exists and if so how I can go about downloading it? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
