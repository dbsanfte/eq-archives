<b>Subject:</b> Umm Twinking Still <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083941127">I will probably regret sending this mail .. Please remember this is my first mail list and I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months now, so many of these comcepts are still new to me (Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I have read the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a very high level player, I did not understand the EXP share problem. He just asked me to keep singing my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with him for several hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this he said he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him I needed exp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for me and initiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and he said yes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a pair of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I could see via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too good for my level. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if I should wear them/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with twinking but dont want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an opinion on what I should!<br/>
 do.<br/>
<br/>
Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>
<br/>
