<div id="ygrps-yiv-116298573"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But more specifically - the fact that the item&#39;s Haste effect added to spell<br/>
haste effects was fundamental to the way that item worked.  Players have<br/>
expected that - and more importantly - as Rokenn pointed out - balancing by<br/>
players (and probably even the final Kunark betas) were done by players<br/>
using these items.  Previously Verant would NEVER change an item<br/>
after-the-fact like this.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess we&#39;re going to have to wait until this afternoon (evening for some)<br/>
to see what effect this &#39;nerf&#39; has on us.  There&#39;s a lot of concern on<br/>
Whineplay and Concert Hall that Bards will be relegated down the list as far<br/>
as haste-providers go.  I don&#39;t think this will happen.  In fact, I think<br/>
we&#39;ll be called on more to provide haste in group situations, even with an<br/>
Enchanter in the group.<br/>
<br/>
If the tanks are hitting less often (and we&#39;re talking, what, a couple of<br/>
hits per round less?) then the Enchanters will be called on to provide more<br/>
crowd control, since it&#39;s taking longer to take down the mobs.  Since we<br/>
Bards are even less renowned for overall crowd control, the group haste<br/>
aspect becomes more important.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the balance issue is a concern - to tune Kunark mobs to melee<br/>
based on the average attack speed of a 100% haste-enhanced group and then<br/>
reduce our attack speed will potentially tip the scales in favour of the<br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
We may be making a big fuss about nothing; we may be singing a death<br/>
dirge... we&#39;ll just have to wait and see.<br/>
