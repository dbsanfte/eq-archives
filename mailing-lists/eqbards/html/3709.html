&gt; Most folks realize you aren&#39;t doing nearly enough damage with bellow to be<br/>
&gt; ABLE to KS - and if it&#39;s a multiple mob, and they are paying attention at<br/>
&gt; all, they will kiss your feet for lullaby. If it&#39;s really low level - I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; even tick them off, get them to turn their attention towards ME, take the<br/>
&gt; heat and just stand there and not swing, let the person get some backhits<br/>
&gt; and heal or at least stop getting hurt.<br/>

Newbies tend to be in zones with guards and NPC merchants.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been killed a grand total of one time using Lullaby in a<br/>
dungeon setting.  I&#39;ve been killed twice playing Lullaby to<br/>
help newbies.  First time was at the bandit camp in GFay, and<br/>
a wandering guard whacked me from behind.  The second time was<br/>
in Butcherblock.  I positioned myself so that a merchant was<br/>
well out of the range I&#39;d figured for Discord via<br/>
experimentation, and hit Lullaby.  Either my estimate was<br/>
wrong or Lullaby&#39;s range is bigger than Discord.<br/>
