 </span></blockquote> Arrgh !!! My anxiety level soars. No Email yet. I tried the phone call<br/>
route of course. The hoops they put you through gott&#39;a be designed to<br/>
discourage callers. Zomaz wont start taking calls again until around 3PM<br/>
EST and I bet their swamped. (1-800-STATION I believe ) This is stupid.<br/>
EVERY online transaction I have ever participated in, EBay and all,<br/>
sends you a confirmation of your order. These IDIOTS didn&#39;t. What does<br/>
that tell you.. sweet deniability ?</div>
