I would say that having his pet kill him is a pretty jerk thing to do, since<br/>
that<br/>
would cause him to lose experience.  i would hope that people on this list<br/>
aren&#39;t that<br/>
nasty that they would be advocating this.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;1)  Do not group with him<br/>
&gt;2)  Charm him and make him attack his pet (he can&#39;t cast spells at all, pet<br/>
&gt;may even kill him before charm wears off)<br/>
&gt;3)  Rinse and repeat<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then for variety, run off with his pet in hot pursuit, chain pet then run<br/>
&gt;back.  Pet will get lost because it&#39;s so far away from him.  Kill him when<br/>
&gt;you get back, he can&#39;t make a new pet so he&#39;s even more helpless than a<br/>
&gt;wizzie.  When he dies pet goes poof.<br/>
