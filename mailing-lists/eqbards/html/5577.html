&gt; Or you can zone out and zone back in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The question I have is did *you* also zone out and come back,<br/>
&gt; and when did the corpse appear in a new location for you?<br/>
&gt; Every time I&#39;ve run across this bug, I&#39;ve been the one to<br/>
&gt; re-zone first, and thus I end up seeing the corpse while the<br/>
&gt; others don&#39;t (and it&#39;s always been their corpse, not mine).<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if it works the other way.<br/>

zone (I didn&#39;t camp out IN Befallen - but just outside its zone boundary)<br/>
and come back and the body was unreachable (However - never zoned in and out<br/>
while remaining online).  There definitely was no change until he Camped out<br/>
and came back.  However - he did NOT try zoning out and back into Befallen<br/>
after we discovered the bug.  Also note that there were several other people<br/>
in the group as well (if that makes a difference)  And once again this was<br/>
many months ago - so the code could have changed dramatically since then.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line though - we have a bunch of good suggestions - have the victim<br/>
zone in and out - party members zone in and out - try logging in and out -<br/>
and then pray to your appropriate God that you can get a guide or GM...<br/>
