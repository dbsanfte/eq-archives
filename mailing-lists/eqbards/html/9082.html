<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-619644423">Can anybody describe to me how they best us their charm to hunt for exp and<br/>
coins? I remember seeing comments like &quot;with charm, our group had no<br/>
downtime&quot;. I can only imagine charming a HG to fight another one for a<br/>
couple rounds then the HG will wake up and run toward me and I&#39;ll have to<br/>
charm again.... I dont even think this will work since you might get hit<br/>
before second charm or even stunned and stop singing (do you even have time<br/>
to turnaround sing speed song and pull the distance off?) or get resisted<br/>
once then got hit 60dam, 70dam again by TWO HGs. From what i imagine, a<br/>
bard would die most of the time charming one HG to hit another.<br/>
<br/>
Is there something I&#39;ve missed?<br/>
