said its looks cool :) I love lookin shiny.<br/>
Not how you were talkin bout the weight of bronze vs steel. Thats the main <br/>
reason i bought steel. I saved myself 10 lbs (only cost me 1100 plat :P). <br/>
Don&#39;t worry bout money. Soon enough you will have tons. I currently have 1600 <br/>
plat in the bank i dont know what to do with :) (anyone sellin a good sword?)<br/>
Anyways, go with what you want. That will make ya the happiest, who cares <br/>
what someone else says looks the best, or is the best or whatever.<br/>
