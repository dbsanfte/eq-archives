Subject: [eqbards] Dueling?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My small 12-member guild is merging with a much larger guild (after merger<br/>
&gt; and a bunch of new recruits should be close to 80) that likes to have<br/>
guild<br/>
&gt; events with a lot of Dueling.  I&#39;ve never done this before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Saturday we had 3 6-man groups duel.  Guessing my way through this - I<br/>
&gt; twisted Elemental and Guardian - to keep our team from getting Nukes etc<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; land on us - and Selos - running around in circles to prevent the tanks<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; landing blows on me.  This was VERY successful.  A ranger gave up trying<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; chase me and peppered me with arrows - but it didn&#39;t really do all that<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; damage.  I would also run into a fracas where there were pets pounding on<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; teammate of mine and would fire off screech.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This got our group to be in a very good shape for the end-game - but then<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t in a good spot for that - as there wasn&#39;t much casting going on.  A<br/>
&gt; Necro was hiding in bones form in a firepot medding while her pet was<br/>
&gt; fighting someone.  I decided to try to go after the necro and tank her -<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; she was good at fearing me - and while I tried to screech her pet - I got<br/>
&gt; some resists.  Her pet ultimately killed me - with a remaining tank (from<br/>
&gt; the other team helping out).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anywho, I&#39;m curious of advice from other Bards who may be more experienced<br/>
&gt; at this as far as good tactics for duels.<br/>
