<div id="ygrps-yiv-644136197">Well after asking for help I should tell all of you how it went :-), 2 groups where able to be made 1st group HG party, (warrior,druidx2,pally,enchaner,wiz), they pulled HG and clops. 2nd group (druid19th,ranger 20th, me&lt;bard22&gt;) we were able to take Giant Skellys, and with a bit of help from the HG group were able to take clopses :-)). I was pretty pumped when our group got jumped by 1hg,1clops, and a giant skelly and with some fast work by the enchanter and my self we were able to finish the fight with everyone above half health.  I must say that bard hate was in full effect as several times I jumped into the HG fights to pass the time and even though I was only singing Anthem and swinging my weapons (with a silvery axe and BE mace skills maxed I was only doing 15-30 damage per round) the HG would often turn from the Warrior(who was doing almost 80 damage per round) to beat the holy hell otta me Mind you with all the buffs I had it was no biggie to take 3 or 4 50-90 point hits but man it was scary hehe.<br/>
All in all it was a good nite I found I could almost solo a Giant skelly, IF and only if I was being healed or kited it a bit.BUT that is cheesy so I did not do it too much( 4times hehe, ok maybe 5, I know it was not more then 6.....or was that 7?)<br/>
Thanks for the great advice :-) and all ye young bards Keep the faith :-))) we are a fun class.<br/>
