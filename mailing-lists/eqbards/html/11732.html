<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058350621">Greetings and Welcome brother bard!<br/>
<br/>
While I understand your desire to be with fellow bards - bardic pride and<br/>
what not, I suggest that you also consider a concept know as &quot;the well<br/>
balanced group.&quot;  Also, if you can manage it, buy it, borrow it, beg it or<br/>
steal it, get a &quot;regular group.&quot;  Having a group of people to play with most<br/>
every time you play and who play about the same amount of time you play - is<br/>
the very best thing to have - you cant have any better weapon nor armor than<br/>
a regular group. And if you have an enchanter in your group, the group<br/>
should fund his/her jewel craft since once that skill is mastered, it can<br/>
fund your whole group for the rest of your career.<br/>
<br/>
Bards have a wide and ever growing array of talent.  And these talents serve<br/>
to enhance the ability of the whole party.  In your youth, your abilities<br/>
will be most helpful to those who wield the steel during combat by adding<br/>
strength and dexterity as well as shielding from magical attackers and to<br/>
heal everyone after combat.  Later on you will learn the mana song and your<br/>
casters will be delighted (in the early years some casters will insist on<br/>
the stamina song - well even though it wont truly help their mana regen - it<br/>
will make them happy if you play it.)<br/>
<br/>
So, I suggest that you try to get a regular group of bard, enchanter,<br/>
healer, tank, tank, optional (healer/druid/shaman/wizard.)  Later on, having<br/>
a druid or wizard will be helpful when you want to leave a dungeon or<br/>
hunting spot as a group (group gate) either at the end of the hunt or if the<br/>
monsters are getting rather insistent that you leave.<br/>
<br/>
You are a bard and will always have the fellowship of other bards no matter<br/>
what guild you have.  But with a guild with lots of other people in lots of<br/>
other classes, you will have a much better time of getting into good groups.<br/>
The only good times I have had with multiple bards in the party have been<br/>
when both have the mana song and then if there is an enchanter as well, the<br/>
caster will be thrilled with the rate that their mana regenerates.<br/>
Sometimes much faster than the monsters regenerate and you end up waiting<br/>
any way.  But my point is - a good group needs a variety of classes.  Each<br/>
class has a specialty.  The bard&#39;s talent lies in helping the others do<br/>
their jobs better.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and good hunting,<br/>

		Greetings, my experienced colleagues.<br/>
<br/>
		_Rhimshot bows_<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		I am Rhimshot, a bard of but the 17th song.  None come<br/>
before me in my<br/>
		family, so no generational gifts aided me in life.  I am<br/>
finding it harder<br/>
		and harder to defeat creatures that should be defeatable by<br/>
myself.<br/>
		However, I had the chance to join 2 of my fellow bards in<br/>
Highhold pass and<br/>
		had a wonderful time.  I would love to have the opportunity<br/>
to travel with<br/>
		my fellow bards again.<br/>
<br/>
		Thus, I turn to you for guidance and support.  Is there a<br/>
guild for bards<br/>
		on the planet of E&#39;ci?  Or a good guild which is heavily<br/>
populated with the<br/>
		singing folk?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		Thank you for your help,<br/>
