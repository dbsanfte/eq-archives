<div id="ygrps-yiv-82330637">Thanks Harmonic.  You know, it really wasn&#39;t THAT bad.  I just pushed<br/>
through it by logging on every night and killing Bouncers with the same<br/>
group in Oggok.  Yes it was boring but I did get through 45th in about 9<br/>
evenings or so.  The last half bubble was the Frenzy camp in Lower Guk which<br/>
is a pretty good place for experience as well (but hard to get into).  After<br/>
hitting 46th it only took me about an hour to be over half a bubble in.  Ha.<br/>
My guild had almost completely cleared Fear that night so with only a half<br/>
bubble into 46th I got to go see that.  I felt like a kid again with most<br/>
things conning red and me kinda cowering behind the others singing.  But<br/>
with a half bub in 46 and only one cleric in the zone you don&#39;t let an Amy<br/>
hit you more than once or twice before backing off.  :-)<br/>
