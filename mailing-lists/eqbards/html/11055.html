<div id="ygrps-yiv-279348657">Actually, the bug for aria came about because verant wanted to &quot;nerf&quot; the<br/>
Equestrielle&#39;s (sp?) cloak of feathers (or whatever) which granted<br/>
levitation...the bug that had been with this cloak was that, as with JBoots,<br/>
you could repeatedly click on the cloak, and it would repeatedly cast<br/>
levitate...the problem with this is that the more times you clicked on it,<br/>
the higher you went...clearly verant didn&#39;t like this, and they decided it<br/>
was time to fix it.  Problem is, there were likely no bard testers to shout<br/>
out &quot;Don&#39;t nerf me (again)!&quot;<br/>

&gt; I doubt the change to ADM would have affected Aria.  Its possible, but<br/>
&gt; unlikely.  The problem with ADM didn&#39;t involve its playing time, it stills<br/>
&gt; plays like it did before, it just actually does something now while its<br/>
&gt; playing.  And yes, if I changed a subroutine I knew was used by other<br/>
&gt; processes I sure as hell would make sure what I did didn&#39;t break those<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; processes.  If I didn&#39;t I would soon be looking for a new job.  In fact,<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; that I think of it, that is my new job.  I spend 80% of my time making<br/>
sure<br/>
&gt; that exactly that sort of thing does not occur.  Something Verant<br/>
obviously<br/>
&gt; cannot be bothered to do.  Come on remember those three DoT&#39;s that when<br/>
&gt; implemented would only work if you cast them on yourself, their testing<br/>
&gt; record speaks for itself and it is mute.<br/>

&gt; Actually, I can see why it slipped by.  They were changing ADM, and<br/>
&gt; whoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>
&gt; coded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>
&gt; it.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>
&gt; *every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>
&gt; the patch would be rather long in getting out.  That bug will likely<br/>
&gt; be fixed in the next patch.<br/>
