<div id="ygrps-yiv-526094812">Ah. Clarity=higher levels. When you have augmentation which is<br/>
1) faster and 2) longer laster (and 3) has more effects than haste<br/>
only so is a good choice for buffs). Though I hope he is casting Clarity<br/>
on your clerics as well :)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, bards seem to get fewer really useful songs at those levels<br/>
than<br/>
in lower ones :(<br/>

&gt;I tried.  He has clarity now and so can usually handle the mana no problem.<br/>
&gt;He ends up most fights with 6+ mobs at 40% mana while the clerics are<br/>
&gt;medding during the end of the fight.  He basically meds thru the fight and<br/>
&gt;pops up when things un-mez.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My Anthem is no where near as good as his haste buffs anyhow.  The one time<br/>
&gt;we tried it, the other two tanks complained about being slow. </span></blockquote></div>
