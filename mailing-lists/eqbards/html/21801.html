<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416560859">Speaking for myself, Lullaby worked a helluva lot better at 18 than it did<br/>
at 31.  I happen to be one of the bards who got caught in the stealth nerf<br/>
of Lullaby so long ago.  One day I was saving my party from certain death,<br/>
then the stealth nerf goes in, and now instead of saving the party, I save<br/>
everyone but myself.  So for the few of us still around from release, I know<br/>
how useful the song used to be.  <br/>

&gt;Yeah I made it all the way to 31.  Too bad I have a life.  My fleibility is<br/>
&gt;nowhere what it was at level 18 even.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be interested to read why you think so?<br/>
<br/>
You got Sonorous Clouding, Consonant Chain, Appalling Screen, Song of the <br/>
Sirens. I agree, these aren&#39;t the best group songs, but all are highly <br/>
effective for the solo bard.<br/>
<br/>
What is it at level 18 that you were able to do that you are now unable to <br/>
do at 31? (no sarcasm here, I really do want to hear what you think.)<br/>
