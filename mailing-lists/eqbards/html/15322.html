<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539231839">Crier&#39;s ZONE: work tagline caused me to think of something interesting.  Do<br/>
any of you have EQ pop up in real life in unexpected ways (no not the amount<br/>
of time we spend playing it as in Harmonic&#39;s note) but other ways here are a<br/>
few examples:<br/>
<br/>
I live in Atlanta, GA.  I commute down GA 400 one of the main arteries into<br/>
the city.  It&#39;s slow bumper to bumper traffic the whole way.  Last week as I<br/>
was travelling into work I glanced over to my left.  There was a bright red<br/>
car, followed by a bluish red car, followed by another bright red car.  What<br/>
immediately popped into my head concerning the middle driver was, &quot;Hmmm,<br/>
he&#39;s out of the zone.&quot;  It made me grin.<br/>
<br/>
Today at work they are pulling lines to place more PC&#39;s in my work area.  As<br/>
they were pulling a line it ran over a piece of upright aluminum and made a<br/>
noise.  My immediate thought was, &quot;Gnoll!&quot;, because it sounded exactly like<br/>
the throaty growl that they make when standing at ease.<br/>
<br/>
I program for a living and am presently taking an antibiotic because my<br/>
daughter brought home &quot;strep throat&quot; from school.  I am finding it very hard<br/>
to concentrate at times and the thought sprang into my head, &quot;I wish someone<br/>
would cast clarity on me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of the TV networks changed the time of one of their shows to a less<br/>
desirable time slot and upon hearing the bit of news thought, &quot;Uh oh, they<br/>
nerfed it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So tell me, am I the only one?<br/>
