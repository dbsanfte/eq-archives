&gt;Are you kidding me.  I&#39;ve been part of this list for over two months.  Did<br/>
&gt;you suddenly decide to bring this up this time because all I said were three<br/>
&gt;words.  How is that any different from the person that said &quot;Great story&quot;?<br/>
&gt;So what if my signature file has a few lines of advertising.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;posting here all this time to hear about and contribute to the bard class in<br/>
&gt;Everquest.  I though the story about the take down of Lord Nagafen was very<br/>
&gt;cool.  I would love to be a part of that someday.  If someone comes in here<br/>
&gt;spamming the mailing list with advertising, great ban them I&#39;m all for that.<br/>
&gt;But that&#39;s not even close to what I have done.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mark - the problem is that your message was 1 part comment, and 4 parts sig<br/>
file.  Most of us, I&#39;m sure, misunderstood the intent. (I know *I* did).<br/>
It looked to me like a typical MLM marketing message (which I get about 4<br/>
million of a day.  Give or take.)  I think we misunderstood that your<br/>
&quot;Great Story&quot; referred to the Lord Nagafen tale from the title, and thought<br/>
that it referred to the telephone number or something.<br/>
<br/>
I personally apologize, and I just hope you can remember to add a little<br/>
more to your comments next time so we don&#39;t have any further &quot;oopses&quot; ;)<br/>
