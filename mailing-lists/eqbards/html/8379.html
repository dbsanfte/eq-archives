 </span></blockquote>Oh please...  I play on Fennin Ro and it&#39;s a real rarity that it&#39;s not at<br/>
the bottom when sorted by player count.  I&#39;ve seen that server with more<br/>
than 2,000 people on it, and I&#39;ve seen the East Commonlands zone have 117<br/>
people in it.  EC with 117 people in it.  Can you imagine the KSing at the<br/>
Orc camps?  &lt;shudder&gt;<br/>

I saw someone comment on the race war server - just thought I&#39;d add my<br/>
experience:<br/>
<br/>
YES, there are people on there who have nothing on their mind but nuking you<br/>
as soon as you pop in a zone - it will happen and the jerk will shout and<br/>
taunt etc.  But that&#39;s only rarely.  More often you see how much fun EQ is<br/>
with a lightened server load.  TZ and VZ cap out around 1000 - IMHO what I<br/>
think should be the Verant&#39;s goal of keeping server populations.  Now if<br/>
only they would admit it... :)<br/>
<br/>
Case and point: in Oasis there were 35 people.  It rocked, and it was all<br/>
the better when someone was attempted to kite specs got rooted by another<br/>
player.  For those of you who haven&#39;t enjoyed the &quot;specs to beach&quot; cries,<br/>
perhaps this isn&#39;t quite as meaningful, but to those of us who have... I was<br/>
grinning ear to ear in RL. :)<br/>
<br/>
So give it a shot if you&#39;re bored (or try the test server, its around<br/>
300-450), its honestly a lot more fun that the congested 1400-1600<br/>
populations you see almost NIGHTLY now and I cringe to think what this<br/>
weekend will bring.  Now all that being said, I&#39;m a hypocrite too - I play<br/>
my &quot;main&quot; chars on Veeshan.  Scroll to the bottom of the list when you sort<br/>
servers by number, you&#39;ll see it. :P<br/>
<br/>
--More work to follow this weekend on song stacking.  Again if anyone wants<br/>
to help contribute you can find a zip excel file at<br/>

Have fun,<br/>
