<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157797636">wait til you get the maestro with the 2 ERU/PAL only shields.  what a<br/>
complete waste of time.  i have the lute too, my estimation was originally<br/>
20% but i think it could be 25 to 30% increase.  whatever it is, i heal 25<br/>
per tick sitting.  isn&#39;t the normal 19?<br/>
