<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042332343">It&#39;s been a month now (since I have had any extended hours in Lower Guk)<br/>
but...<br/>
<br/>
The last time I was in the Ghoul Lord room we had a runner start to take off<br/>
and instead of yelling &quot;snare it!&quot; they yelled: &quot;let it go - maybe it will<br/>
pull stuff for us...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the last time I was in the King room, we were getting steady pulls.  I<br/>
asked how do we get all these frogs when there are 80+ people in the zone?<br/>
I was told you are pretty damn deep in Lower Guk. Then our enchanter went<br/>
afk or LD during a pull or was it the room spawn. We started getting more<br/>
and more froggies beating on him. I paniced and feared them off.  Heh, well,<br/>
its been a while since I&#39;d seen quite so many froggies all at once (when<br/>
they came back with a bunch of friends.)<br/>
<br/>
So, playing AE songs in dungeons?  I guess it depends on: where you are in<br/>
which dungeon and what song.  Fearing frogs in the King room is still a<br/>
&quot;no-no!&quot;  When there are 6 to 8 dogs frenzied at the zone in Sol B, chain<br/>
one and fear the rest of them off (heh, they can get more friend - all of<br/>
them are already there.)<br/>

&gt; With overcrowding a problem on almost every server, I&#39;m wondering if it is<br/>
&gt; now safe to add these songs back to our playlist. </span></blockquote></div>
