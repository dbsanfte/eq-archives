<b>Subject:</b> Charging for services. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032457714">I have never set a price for my services because I find that donations work<br/>
out very well.  When I hit level 4 and got the spell someone needed help<br/>
right away.  I helped him and got 3PP.  That was a fortune at level 3.  A<br/>
few levels later while fighting in West Karana I heard someone cry out for<br/>
help.  I had to run to the zone with Croon and Froon chasing me but he got<br/>
his corpse.  After we met back up I got about 29 PP worth of stuff from him.<br/>
That is BY FAR the best I have been paid.  If people ask I usually tell them<br/>
I have received between 1GP and 29PP before.  I usually get about 1PP<br/>
depending on the difficulty.  I think I&#39;ll stick with this practice.  But if<br/>
I am running to somewhere an catch up to someone going the same place I will<br/>
invite them and speed them up for no charge.  But if I have to go out of my<br/>
way I probably would.<br/>
