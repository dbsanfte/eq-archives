<div id="ygrps-yiv-390259424">Ahh one point I forgot to make is I&#39;m glad that they didn&#39;t nerf normal pets<br/>
with feign. That would be hell when soloing because pet taunts just play<br/>
suck. I had the crusader in guk on me and I hadn&#39;t cast a spell but he still<br/>
came over and decided to whack on me. Charm is not the end of the world<br/>
because I can come up with tactics that basically replace the sutff like<br/>
lord room. One other person is neeeded but not the end of the world.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, here you have it straight from the EQ team themselves.  In an excerpt<br/>
&gt;from the test server:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Solution:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<br/>
&gt;suicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<br/>
&gt;adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we<br/>
&gt;do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key<br/>
&gt;spawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will<br/>
 </span></blockquote>immediately<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;break Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will not be affected.  While<br/>
&gt;this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet,<br/>
&gt;it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that<br/>
&gt;charming an NPC does.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We would appreciate diligent testing of this change, to insure that no<br/>
&gt;unforeseen problems have been caused by it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-The EverQuest Team<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So now they are saying they would appreciate diligent testing of a change?<br/>
&gt;Wtf?  Who is the customer and who is the service provider here?  I guess<br/>
&gt;this tells us everything we need to know about Verant test procedure.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Throw<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the code out on the test server and hope some player puts it to task.<br/>
