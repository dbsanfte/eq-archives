mobs negotiating the stairs and corners.  The method I always<br/>
used to unstick them was to charm them.  Then they&#39;d follow me<br/>
without any problems (give them a /pet follow me command if<br/>
they&#39;re stubborn).  I think the AI is getting confused about<br/>
the range to target (close enough to stop moving, far enough<br/>
that it can&#39;t attack), because you&#39;d think mobs and pets would<br/>
use the same pathing.<br/>

the other half consider it an opportunity.<br/>
