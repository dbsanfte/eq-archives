Easy boy...No one is an idiot here... Using all caps and 17 exclamation<br/>
points only makes you look like a weiner.<br/>
<br/>
You have a point, but please take it easy.<br/>

DON&#39;T /PETITION IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
There are two different groups of people that work on Verant, GMs and<br/>
Developers.  GMs are there to help you with in-game problems.  They cannot<br/>
modify the database or give you a different item.  They don&#39;t even interact<br/>
with Developers.  GMs cannot fix this type of problem.<br/>
<br/>
There are /feedback and /bug commands to take care of these types of<br/>
problems.  These commands will be routed to the Developers who can fix the<br/>
problem.  Or email your complaints to Verant directly.<br/>
<br/>
When you order pizza delivery, and your pizza is running late, who do you<br/>
call?  You probably dial 911.  Instead, you should think about who can<br/>
actually help you with the problem.  Call the pizza company.<br/>
<br/>
Why should this matter to us?  Well if IDIOTS fill the petition queue with<br/>
RETARDED petitions, it takes the GMs longer to handle real petitions.  How<br/>
would everyone on Innoruuk feel if their petitions took 30 minutes longer to<br/>
handle because some IDIOTS felt they could get the database changed by<br/>
filling up the petition queue?<br/>
<br/>
I understand your frustrations, but don&#39;t frustrate everyone else with your<br/>
actions.<br/>

&gt; WTF?????  wis and int?  Man I was ripped off, this sucks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; /petition You all messed up again, you gave me cleric type<br/>
&gt; armor, what gives?  Don&#39;t you realize bards primary stats<br/>
&gt; are in STR/DEX/AGI/CHA?  You probably just typo&#39;d in the<br/>
&gt; armor database again, which is fairly typical these days. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GM tells you &#39;Hail, guide Soandso here.  I&#39;ve read your<br/>
&gt; petition.  And honestly there&#39;s nothing I can do, if you<br/>
&gt; would file a bug report that would be appreciated&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If Verant does this again, like they did on the PoS, err I<br/>
&gt; mean PoF armor (not to mention the pisspoor color) I will<br/>
&gt; flood them with feedback/petitions/etc.  In fact everytime<br/>
&gt; I take a faction hit from someone else&#39;s kill, I petition.<br/>
&gt; Only the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and typing a message<br/>
&gt; in a bug report that is never read gets me more frustrated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hate working hard for a crappy reward.  That&#39;s why I currently<br/>
&gt; do no quests (for the ones that actually work).  These days in<br/>
&gt; Norrath are making this bard bitter =)<br/>
