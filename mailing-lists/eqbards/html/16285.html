<div id="ygrps-yiv-401966745">I&#39;d be tempted to agree with that, but their are several places where it is<br/>
ridiculous for a group to go in and sit and do nothing for hours while<br/>
waiting for one spawn because there are only two and another group has<br/>
demanded you let them have the other one.  The group who can play for hours<br/>
still gets the benefit as they are going to be there for hours anyhow, your<br/>
group gets their limited playing time suddenly made nearly pointless while<br/>
had the group that&#39;s going to be on for 6 hours simply let you have their<br/>
two hours they would miss only 1/3 rd of their available time, you are<br/>
forced to lose half your time which may well make the room unviable for you.<br/>
Result is you move on to find something you can actually enjoy your two<br/>
hours at and the long termers get the whole room anyhow for the full time.<br/>
Eventually the short timers will find everything shared and will quit in<br/>
frustration as they never get a turn at getting a useful chance to do a room<br/>
instead getting many turns that are not very useful.<br/>

&gt; The postings made it clear its worse than that.  If a room has two named<br/>
&gt; spawns a second group can freely waltz in and demand to be allowed to camp<br/>
&gt; one of the named spawns.  If its a room with two different items that<br/>
&gt; different classes in your group wants, suddenly part of your group has<br/>
&gt; nothing to gain from camping the room and will likely leave in disgust<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; this happens two or three times.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think most of you guys are looking at worst-case<br/>
scenarios.  e.g. you really really want this item and have<br/>
been spending hours camping it, someone comes in and demands<br/>
to share the spawn, and he gets the item on the next spawn.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the big picture, the mobs still spawn at the<br/>
same rate, the number of rare items dropped per day is still<br/>
the same.  The only thing that&#39;s changed is who has access to<br/>
them.  The &quot;group at the camp owns the spawn until they leave<br/>
or die&quot; system favors those with lots of playtime - folks who<br/>
can get a room early while the servers are uncrowded, and hold<br/>
it until late at night.  With the new rules, people without as<br/>
much time to play, or heaven forbid people dungeon crawling,<br/>
will have access to camped spawns.  Yes someone might demand<br/>
you share your SMR camp and get it ahead of you, but now you<br/>
can demand someone share their SMR camp with you, instead of<br/>
waiting 2 weeks for a free spot.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the transition is going to be rather harsh.  <br/>
People who try to be nice and respect the old rules are going<br/>
to get screwed because they&#39;ll never want to &quot;impose&quot; the new<br/>
rule on others, while others will impose it on them.  Folks<br/>
who break difficult spawns are also not going to be adequately<br/>
rewarded (though my philosophy is to kill everything ASAP, and<br/>
if someone who can&#39;t handle it demands to share, just invis or<br/>
move back and let him at it).<br/>
<br/>
And the fundamental problem is still overcrowding and static<br/>
named mobs.<br/>
