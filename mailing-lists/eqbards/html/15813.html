&gt; &gt; Most casters&#39; spells do not increase in power as they level and become<br/>
&gt; &gt; obsolete as the new spells are granted...  I would guess that the universe<br/>
&gt; &gt; of useable spells is pretty similar for Bards as for casters at any given<br/>
&gt; &gt; level.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And perhaps we have it BETTER... At 36 with Celerity - I use our Level 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; Song - Chant of Battle - it gives AC +4, STR and Dex +14.  How many casters<br/>
&gt; &gt; use spells granted at level 1 when they&#39;re level 36?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I debunked this in the bard petition thread on the official<br/>
&gt; boards.  At level 40, a shaman can outbuff Celerity + Chant,<br/>
&gt; using mostly L16-24 buffs.  Doing so takes less than half his<br/>
&gt; mana regeneration rate - he has the rest to nuke, heal, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And the argument usually used to justify the bard&#39;s lower abilitys to<br/>
buff is that the bard buffs the whole party at once using no mana.<br/>
Unfortunately that not only ignores the fact that the whole party rarely<br/>
all need that particular buff, but that the equivalant buffing done by a<br/>
caster costs them barely noticable mana. In the above case, the shaman<br/>
has a +20 dex spell at L24 that costs 40 mana. By L36 40 mana is a<br/>
barely noticable drop in the mana bar and it&#39;s unlikely the shaman is<br/>
going to need to cast it on more than a couple of people in the party<br/>
who really benefit from it.<br/>
