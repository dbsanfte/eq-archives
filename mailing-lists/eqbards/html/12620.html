<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545352617"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; After reading on this board that pixie strike can interrupt spell casters<br/>
&gt; attempts at casting a spell, I have tried using this song for this purpose.<br/>
&gt; When I see the text message that the mob is starting to cast a spell, I<br/>
&gt; immediately stop what I&#39;m playing and start up pixie strike. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, you must start Pixie Strike BEFORE the mob begins to cast. I have<br/>
used Pixie most often in CT. When a healing Lizard appears, I will go<br/>
2-3 rounds playing my normal mix of songs, but as the Lizards health<br/>
approaches 50%, I switch to 100% pixie strike. This prevents the mob<br/>
from casting ~90% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
On a dangerous mob (like Tae Ew Diviner) who can cast charm, I might<br/>
play pixie from start to finish. I have found that the mobs have a<br/>
rhythm of casting. If My pixie strike is timed right to interrupt one<br/>
spell, it will probably catch the next one also. If it is NOT timed<br/>
right (I start Pixie, then see that the mob started casting BEFORE me) I<br/>
will stutter my pixie strike so that I can catch the next one.<br/>
<br/>
Also, while using this spell in the TEMPLE in CT, we had almost died to<br/>
a bad pull/spawn/wandering mob. Both tanks were down below 20% and<br/>
another mob came around the corner. I commanded all to sit/med/heal, and<br/>
I started Pixie/Clarity/Pixie. I was able to keep the Mob mezzed for 3<br/>
minutes with only rare breakouts. Then we were all healed up and took<br/>
him out.<br/>
