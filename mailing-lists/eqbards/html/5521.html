&gt; If you die while zoning, the servers get confused - because <br/>
&gt; server A) says<br/>
&gt; &quot;He&#39;s dead Jim&quot;, while server B) says &quot;No he&#39;s not, I&#39;ve got him!&quot;<br/>
&gt; The master server then says &quot;Alright  - since you two can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; agree, revert<br/>
&gt; him back to his last save point.&quot;<br/>
&gt; This was implemented because there *is* a couple of second <br/>
&gt; overlap while<br/>
&gt; you are plucked from one server and plopped into the other.  <br/>
&gt; During this<br/>
&gt; time, if you died, there&#39;d be a corpse in one zone, while <br/>
&gt; your healthy body<br/>
&gt; was in the second zone.  You could then, theoretically skip <br/>
&gt; back and loot<br/>
&gt; your corpse, duping items.  Thus we have the new system, <br/>
&gt; which results in<br/>
&gt; some occasional peculiarities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, now that&#39;s two questions answered at once.  I&#39;ve zoned into places and<br/>
noticed messages in the chat window saying a &lt;insert local baddy name here&gt;<br/>
tries to hit you but misses just before the zone message and though &quot;hmm,<br/>
don&#39;t recall anyone swiping at me&quot;  And a while back a friend of mine was<br/>
having a multiple deaths night and found a corpse at a zone border he didn&#39;t<br/>
remember leaving one at which had duplicates of his back up armor!  Sweet!<br/>
Wish I had that kind of luck.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;He&#39;s dead Jim&quot;  Ha ha ha!!  Sometimes I swear Scotty is Verant&#39;s chief<br/>
engineer!</div>
