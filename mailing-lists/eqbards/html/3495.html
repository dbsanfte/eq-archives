&gt; I personally don&#39;t twist, I may switch up songs in battle if the needs<br/>
&gt; arise, but I have never found twisting to be that big a benefit.  At 17th<br/>
&gt; level the healing song only restores 7hp/tick while standing, and the<br/>
&gt; average monster is hitting for 20-50 pts per hit, so the heal isn&#39;t worth<br/>
&gt; it, when if I play anthem and it doesn&#39;t ever quit they get a more<br/>

The 7hp/tick can easily turn into 42hp/tick<br/>
<br/>
I agree that 7hp/tick is not worth it, but if three or more people are<br/>
damaged, then the 21+ hps may make it more worthwhile.  Play around will all<br/>
