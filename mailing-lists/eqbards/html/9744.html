<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139545317">In all seriousness I am hoping for an intermediate between Desperate Dirge<br/>
and Bellow.  Maybe a single target like bellow but for more damage and<br/>
instrument aligned at lvl 39.  A higher level DoT might be a good one too,<br/>
but neither of these would have to wait for anything so its unlikely that<br/>
this is it.  Most likely it is something we have no clue on, enchanting<br/>
those instruments we currently cannot make yet perhaps?  A bard specific<br/>
trade skill like instrument making would be cool.<br/>

One other thing about missing songs.  Assuming Verant is having a hard time<br/>
trying to figure out what our missing songs should be, what does that say<br/>
about the 50-75 level songs once the expansion comes out?  Who wants to bet<br/>
that we will have the same problem then as we do now? <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Throughout the history of this list, we have had several discussions on<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; missing songs.  Verant is unlikely to give us a new song that &quot;unbalances&quot;<br/>
&gt; our class, i.e. a binding song.  Several people have come up with<br/>
&gt; ideas/suggestions for our missing songs.  For the sake of discussion, what<br/>
&gt; type of songs can they give us that will not upset the class balance.<br/>
&gt; Lets<br/>
&gt; classify our songs into categories.  The categories I can come up with<br/>
&gt; are:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Stat buffing  		i.e. Anthem, Warsong, Chant of Battle, etc.<br/>
&gt; that raise a primary stat/attack bonuses<br/>
&gt; 2) Resistance buffing 	i.e. rhythm and psalm series <br/>
&gt; 3) Regeneration  	i.e. Hymm, Jig, Mana song<br/>
&gt; 4) Direct damage 	i.e. Bellow and Desperate Dirge<br/>
&gt; 5) Damage over time 	i.e  DDD and CoD<br/>
&gt; 6) Movement  		i.e. Selos and teleport song<br/>
&gt; 7) Target negative effect 	i.e. Chains, Lullaby, Pixie Strike, Charm,<br/>
&gt; Largos<br/>
&gt; 8) General 		i.e  invisibility, underwater breathing and<br/>
&gt; levitation song<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m only 26th level so I don&#39;t have much knowledge of the songs higher<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; 30th level.  As a result, there are probably a couple more categories to<br/>
&gt; add.  These categories are enough though for the sake of discussion.  I<br/>
&gt; would guess that Verant thinks they have pretty much covered all the bases<br/>
&gt; in regards to our songs.  We have a wide variety of choices to select<br/>
&gt; from.<br/>
&gt; Assuming that Verant thinks our current songs provide everything we need,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; would imagine they are having a tough time deciding on what our missing<br/>
&gt; songs should do.  Assuming that they don&#39;t want to give us any new<br/>
&gt; abilities, the only option I see is to give us better versions or<br/>
&gt; combinations of songs we already have.   For example, a better version of<br/>
&gt; Hymn that heals more damage per tick.  Another possibility is a<br/>
&gt; combination<br/>
&gt; of Hymn and Jig to provide both health and stamina recovery.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So to sum it all up, I think it is more likely that our missing songs will<br/>
&gt; be better versions/combos of our current songs versus songs that give us a<br/>
&gt; new ability such as bind or gate.  What does everyone else think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant once replied to this - saying &quot;The new songs will be added once<br/>
&gt; &gt; something else is added&quot;..  As far as a bind song - if the info from JMC<br/>
&gt; &gt; (a<br/>
&gt; &gt; former member of this list who allegedly had close contacts within the<br/>
&gt; &gt; development group) It ain&#39;t ever gonna happen.<br/>
