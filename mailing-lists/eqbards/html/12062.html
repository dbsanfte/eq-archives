<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511088652"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My hunch is your experience is colored by dual-wielding Yaks<br/>
&gt; and doing way more damage than is typical for a bard.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This is most likely the case.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The primary problem I&#39;ve been having lately is that I never get<br/>
&gt; hit in fights.  Lately, even Hymn hasn&#39;t been enough to get<br/>
&gt; mobs on me.  I&#39;ve had to resort to direct taunts like the<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Well, I experience the same thing. (unless I&#39;m procing like<br/>
  mad -- I&#39;ve got four consectutive procs in a row once)  I<br/>
  definitely don&#39;t take the beating I used to.  But, any un-<br/>
  attended mob will swarm you if you play Hymm.  There&#39;s no<br/>
  exception to that.  On a multimob pull, if you are playing<br/>
  Hymm, you will be attacked by the extras 100% of the time.<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure how Hymm isn&#39;t taunting off mobs, unless they&#39;ve<br/>
  been previously engaged.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Outside of fights, what else is there to play besides Clarity<br/>
&gt; and Hymn?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Straight Clarity will most likely not give me a sore wrist<br/>
  from twisting in the downtime.  Plus, in areas that are<br/>
  unpredictable the group cannot wait for me to fill them<br/>
  up with health.  This is where rangers and paladins are<br/>
  nice to have around as they can do the healing after the<br/>
  battle is over, while the real healers med.  Clarity thus<br/>
  becomes more important in situations where the group must<br/>
  be ready for the next mob encounter (which could be random).<br/>
  Rangers/Paladins doing post-battle healing do not increase<br/>
  downtime, as they are typically full mana anyway and fill<br/>
  up quicker than it takes the true healers to fill up.<br/>
  This also falls into the &#39;it depends&#39; scenario.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would say it really depends on the situation.  I find it odd<br/>
&gt; that you say 12-14 points (healed) each round just doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; keep up, yet you suggest a damage shield in its place which<br/>
&gt; will only do about 8-12 points (damage) each round.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I should have clarified this more.  Healing 12-14 points is<br/>
  with the lute in hand.  The dmg shield provided from Psalm<br/>
  still allows the bard to fight with his weapons.  Without<br/>
  the lute 6-7 points of healing occurs.  (these numbers based<br/>
  on a L35ish bard, as we were focusing on) The dmg shield nor<br/>
  healing will provide sufficient worth if all members are not<br/>
  being engaged.  Otherwise you end up healing one person, while<br/>
  everyone else is at max health, or you dmg shield everyone but<br/>
  the mob is only attacking one person.  Whether you do direct<br/>
  dmg (shield) or indirect dmg (healing) - neither of the two<br/>
  will really make a single mob battle any quicker.  Multimob<br/>
  battles would benefit from it, however the bard will take <br/>
  serious heat from using Hymm, and that was my original point.<br/>
  So yes, instead of saying resist/dmg shield, I should have<br/>
  said resist/other utility song ;)<br/>
