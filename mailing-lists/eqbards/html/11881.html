&gt; &gt; but lately it seems like the people playing wizards are some of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; dumbest in the game. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   That is an understatement.  The text when making your character:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   WIZARD.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Welcome to Eurdin, city of knowledge...blah blah blah.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   This class/deity/race cominbation is of HIGH idiocy.<br/>

My main character is the wizard, and yes, I do agree that they are some<br/>
really dumb wizards out there...but there are some really dumb<br/>
(insert any class here)&#39;s out there also.<br/>
<br/>
Wizards just have the biggest exclamation points on their mistakes.<br/>
