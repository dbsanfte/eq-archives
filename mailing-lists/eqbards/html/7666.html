&gt; &gt; 	No bind, not a caster class<br/>
&gt; &gt; 	No Parry, not a melee class<br/>
&gt; &gt; 	No special weapons, not a hybrid class<br/>
&gt; &gt; 	etc., etc., etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am very happy with the classes I play.  I have a level 40 druid and a <br/>
level 23 bard.  In spite of Verant&#39;s nerfing of both classes from time to <br/>
time, I still enjoy them.<br/>
<br/>
There are things my druid can do that my bard can&#39;t and visa versa.  Bind is <br/>
one of those.  Many times I&#39;ll be playing my druid and run into a situation <br/>
that my bard could have handled,(if levels were the same) that the druid <br/>
couldnt.... and visa versa.<br/>
<br/>
As for bards getting bind.  I don&#39;t think that will happen, nor do I think <br/>
it should.. unless the hybrid and melee classes get it too.(otherwise you <br/>
will have people claiming bards are too powerful, which will lead to a nerf <br/>
for bards later on)  I dont, however, appreciate having to run through 3 or <br/>
4 zones to retreive my stuff, but that is the price I pay for having so much <br/>
fun with my bard.  I think, perhaps, a compromise to the problem would be to <br/>
allow the classes that don&#39;t have bind to get bound anywhere with the popup <br/>
box for consent, as someone on here suggested.<br/>
<br/>
I think this would help solve the problem of not being able to find a bind <br/>
in cities, because all the casters are out fighting somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, that you can&#39;t make everyone happy all of the time.<br/>
