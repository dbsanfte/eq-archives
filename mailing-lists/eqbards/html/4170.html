&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s quite clear that simply twinking a character and CAMPING for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; items to twink another char are quite different. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But these are indistinguishable.  Given a symptom that has a<br/>
&gt; &gt; neutral cause and a negative cause, you are going to share in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the misery handed out by those bitter about the negative<br/>
&gt; &gt; cause.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;re indistinguishable to you. What business is it of yours? None. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve stated over and over how twinking can negatively impact<br/>
the gameplay of non-twinkers.  That makes it my business.  If<br/>
all of a sudden your pay was cut by 25%, but you were unable<br/>
to determine exactly who was responsible for the decision,<br/>
wouldn&#39;t you say it&#39;s your business?<br/>

&gt; pain due to a twinked person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most everyone agrees the servers are overcrowded.  If 20% of<br/>
the players are twinked, and they clear out 30% of the mobs in<br/>
an area because they are more effective, that leaves 70% of<br/>
the mobs for the other 80% of players.  See the pain?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had friends do the same thing as you.  But I daresay,<br/>
&gt; &gt; most twinked characters are secondary (or third, or fourth,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc) characters made by players who want to build up a<br/>
&gt; &gt; different class/character quickly, with little regard for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the toes they&#39;ll be stepping on on the way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh yes, look at all those toes I stepped on by not camping for tomahawks..<br/>
&gt; oh my god. I guess I better go camp those items (with my new char), making<br/>
&gt; everyone wait longer and the game less and less fun for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reread the first line in my message you&#39;re quoting.  I have no<br/>
problem with giving equipment to other characters when you&#39;re<br/>
done using it.  All I was saying is that that sort of twinking<br/>
is indistinguishable from the evil sort, and as such you are<br/>
going to catch some of the flak aimed at the evil kind.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The alternative is to stop crying and whining over things that are most<br/>
&gt; likely not hurting you and most likely do more good than harm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your choice seems to be to shoot all the innocents just in case there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; bad guy in there. What an honorable decision, yes, you shot the bad guys..<br/>
&gt; nevermind those people who are actually making the situation better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find it odd that you&#39;re so upset about this.  If you&#39;re one<br/>
of these innocents, the *only* problem you&#39;ll have which can&#39;t<br/>
be handled by the /ignore command is people withholding help<br/>
from you.  Why should people be obligated to help you?  I<br/>
sense a double-standard - twinkers should be free to play the<br/>
game the way they choose, but other players shouldn&#39;t be free<br/>
to withhold help from twinkers?<br/>
<br/>
And if it bothers you this much, you can stop it immediately -<br/>
put away your twinked items until they&#39;re appropriate for your<br/>
level.<br/>
