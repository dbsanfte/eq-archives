<div id="ygrps-yiv-396821818">Now that sort of effect I would like. It would make it somewhat of a coup<br/>
de grace(?) thing as well as making the bard weigh the odds of the damage vs<br/>
the delay. Bards have other songs that can do small amounts of damage<br/>
consistently but I&#39;ve seen nor heard of nothing that is powerful with a<br/>
large delay. Mages have their powerful damage spells but using them drains<br/>
your mana quickly requiring a delay to build it back up.<br/>

Apparently the way Bellow was supposed to work was that it was to do the<br/>
huge amount<br/>
of damage that it originally did (something like four times what it does<br/>
now), but<br/>
singing it was supposed to render you unable to sing any other song for the<br/>
entire<br/>
delay time of the Bellow (to see how long this is, bellow at something once<br/>
and see<br/>
how long it takes for the button to enable itself again without you clicking<br/>
on it).<br/>
<br/>
I guess the idea was that the song was bad for your voice.  :)<br/>
<br/>
If Bellow actually worked this way, would it be an improvement?  Would<br/>
people prefer<br/>
that it worked this way?<br/>
