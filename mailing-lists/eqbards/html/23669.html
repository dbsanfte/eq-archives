<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-562263265">I generally like to move around a lot as well.  Fighting in the same zone<br/>
for an extended period of time bores me.  However, I have been trying to get<br/>
a Harmonic Dagger and/or Partisan from Karnors to upgrade my weapons.<br/>
Currently I am using a Journeyman Walking Stick and Martune Rapier.  The JWS<br/>
is a good weapon for bards since it procs Tashani.  I need to upgrade the<br/>
Martune Rapier though.  There are a lot of other zones I can get EXP in, but<br/>
at least in Karnors I can get good EXP plus a chance at getting one of the<br/>
two weapons.  With that said, I am about to give up on actually ever looting<br/>
a Partisan or Harmonic Dagger.  I&#39;ve killed the caller of Sathir so many<br/>
times I have lost count.  He has dropped the kunzar cloak every time.   Have<br/>
never been able to get into a hand/jail group to camp the drolvarg warlord<br/>
for the HD.  So I&#39;m thinking, for a change of pace, to instead head to<br/>
Sebilis and hopefully get some Singing Steel pieces instead of upgrading my<br/>
weapons.  However, if Sebilis at 51 is over my head, then I will stick to<br/>
Karnors.<br/>

I move around a lot - and spent a lot of time in Karnor and Skyfire to get<br/>
experience.  Also - Raptors in Timourous Deep - while giving next to loot at<br/>
all (runes and words is alls) give great experience.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never been to Sebilis and was thinking of making that my main hangout<br/>
for a while once I get to 51st level.  For those of you with a lot of<br/>
experience hunting in that zone, would like your feedback.  Since all of the<br/>
mobs there will be 45+, I assume Pixie Strike will not be that effective.<br/>
Not certain how well Charm will work.  I know once I get to 53 and get SoT<br/>
then crowd control will be a lot easier.  But until then, how effective will<br/>
I be at performing crowd control in Sebilis?  Would it be smarter to hang<br/>
out in Karnors and other zones until I get to 53 and head to Sebilis then?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
