<div id="ygrps-yiv-446304789">You think that&#39;s good, I got into the Phase 1 beta back in early July of<br/>
&#39;98.  I used to buy 1 or 2 games a month, but since then I think I&#39;ve<br/>
bought a total of maybe 3 other games, none of which I have played (with<br/>
the exception of Grim Fandango, one of the best adventure games I&#39;ve ever<br/>
played).  So that&#39;s more than a year of game money saved by EQ.  :)<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m STILL only a level 26 bard.  :)<br/>

&gt;&lt;LOL&gt; I absolutely agree as well.  Have not spent one iota of coin, err,<br/>
&gt;money on video games since April - and not so much as a peek at new reviews,<br/>
&gt;except maybe to snoop around for info on the new add-on.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; One last thing,  before EQ came out,  I averaged buying <br/>
&gt;&gt; about 10 computer<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; games a year.  A lot of them I would not even finish <br/>
&gt;&gt; because I got bored<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; with them.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since April and I am still <br/>
&gt;&gt; having lots of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; fun playing.  As a 22d level bard, I still have alot of <br/>
&gt;&gt; things I can look<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; forward to doing in the game.  I haven&#39;t even considered <br/>
&gt;&gt; buying a new game<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; since April. <br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;   Well put !!!! I was just telling my wife how much money she save<br/>
&gt;&gt; because I have not brought the 3 or 4 games a month that I used to ! <br/>
&gt;&gt; Now I may but Diablo 2 but EQ I play every day and the one game I<br/>
&gt;&gt; brought since EQ (TA Kingdoms) I haven&#39;t bothered to finish. <br/>
&gt;&gt; But I will<br/>
&gt;&gt; collect pop bottles on the side of the road to get the EQ <br/>
&gt;&gt; Expansion pack<br/>
&gt;&gt; :) You can&#39;t beat playing with real folk :)<br/>
