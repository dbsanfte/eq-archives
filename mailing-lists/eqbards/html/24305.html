&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ya, I knew that.  Actually, you don&#39;t even have to click to pause it, <br/>
&gt; you can just click done and come back.  But, once you log, you have <br/>
&gt; to start a new game.  But why would multiplayer be pointless?  In my <br/>
&gt; mind, they would just make it so you have to start a new game with <br/>
&gt; another player so that both are starting fresh.  I think that it <br/>
&gt; would be fun :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m glad that they added Gems.  I know a while back, many players <br/>
&gt; were requesting casinos in towns so that they can gamble and play <br/>
&gt; games.  They said that it would be too buggy and exploitable <br/>
&gt; possibly, but I think that Gems (and other possible future games) is <br/>
&gt; a good compromise.  The best things I can see about it are...  Camps <br/>
&gt; will become much less boring, when you still have to stare at the <br/>
&gt; spell books with pre-35 casters, waiting for group <br/>
&gt; assignments/buffing on raids, etc.  Although, like you said.  People <br/>
&gt; can die if they aren&#39;t paying attention and just playing Gems.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You can resume paused games at a later stage.  To pause, click on <br/>
&gt; the game<br/>
&gt; &gt; window, click &quot;done&quot; and go do something else.  To resume, type <br/>
&gt; /gems and<br/>
&gt; &gt; click on the paused screen to continue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure if this works if you re-log.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Worryingly enough, I saw a group in Karnors almost get wiped out <br/>
&gt; last night<br/>
&gt; &gt; because their Enchanter was busy playing gems while medding.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Why do you keep saying that you can play non stop.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;understand what you are saying.  Do you mean that there is a way <br/>
&gt; &gt;to make<br/>
&gt; &gt; it so the game doesn&#39;t reset when you log?  I&#39;m &gt;confused.<br/>
