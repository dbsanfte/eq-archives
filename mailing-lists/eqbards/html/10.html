&gt;Dear brothers and sisters:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I wander the land of Norrath, battle creatures, and gain experience, I<br/>
&gt;often hear voices whisper things to me like &quot;You hit a Skeleton for 15<br/>
&gt;damage&quot; or &quot;A Gnoll tries to pierce you, but misses&quot;. As I gain more and<br/>
&gt;more skill, my mind wonders what all of these whispers mean, and how they<br/>
&gt;are derived.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am not an experienced RPGer. I have played UO, and I have played EQ. I<br/>
&gt;have never played any other MUD, any 1 player RPG computer game, or<br/>
&gt;anything like D&D. There seems to be the expectation in EQ that you know<br/>
&gt;what things like Dexterity, Agility, Strength, Armor Class, etc. are for<br/>
&gt;and what they affect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meanwhile, items that boost these numbers by very very small amounts are<br/>
&gt;expensive, and make me wonder why I should spend 5 plat on armor that<br/>
&gt;increases my AC by 2%, or 1 plat on a ring that gives me 2 extra Dex.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In Everquest, its not your individual piece of equipment, but the total of<br/>
them all that counts. like, combining every piece of equipment i have, my<br/>
suit of armor ia AC 115, +2 agility, +5 Strength, +5 magic resistance,<br/>
etc.... it all adds up :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyone who can answer any of the following questions please do so. I would<br/>
&gt;be very grateful, for I am getting very frusrated with the fact that<br/>
&gt;everyone else in the game seems to know what is going on, and I do not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What does strength affect in combat? What does dexterity affect in combat?<br/>
&gt;What does agility affect in combat? Are jewelry or other enhancements that<br/>
&gt;add only 1 or 2 to these stats really worth it? Do they really make a<br/>
&gt;difference, and how do you know?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Strength affects your ability to hit for more damage. for example, Jim uses<br/>
a sword that has a DMG of 5, which means he can hit for a max of 11 points o<br/>
f damage , (formula is DMG x 2 + 1) and because his strength is 100, he<br/>
usually hits for 8-11. but Ned, the wood elf ranger, his strength is 80, and<br/>
he hits anywhere from 3-11 usually. Dexterity, along with Offense skill and<br/>
your skill in the weapon type you use, affects your ability to hit a target,<br/>
as opposed to whiffing, as well as reduced casting time for mages. Agility<br/>
helps your natural armor class, along with the Defense skill.  jewelry and<br/>
other expensive, stat-enhancing is well worth it, but a good suit of armor<br/>
and a strong weapon take precedence.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What is armour for? Does it absorb damage? Or is it figured into whether<br/>
&gt;you actually get hit? Or both?<br/>
&gt;What does the AC value of armor actually mean? Does adding 3 or 4 to your<br/>
&gt;AC actually make a difference?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AC makes a HUGE difference. and , it does indeed absorb damage, but only<br/>
when you wear chain or plate class armor.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What is the ATK stat that goes up with each level?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ATK is your attack, and is equivalent to AD&D&#39;s THAC0. its your ability to<br/>
hit a target with a weapon.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Every weapon has a delay. How long is the delay is seconds?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not sure, but i think its, Delay/10 = delay in seconds. there is quite a<br/>
noticeable difference between the delay of a dagger and a halberd :)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There are several combat skills. One is for your weapon type (i.e. 1H<br/>
&gt;slahsing) and there are others for offense and defense. What are each<br/>
&gt;of these for? When do they get figured in?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Offense is your ability to hit a target and deal damage regardless of your<br/>
weapon skill. Example, a sportsman fencer who has never seen real combat<br/>
would be a master in Piercing, but would have an offense of 0, because, he<br/>
knows how to wield his weapon, but not inflict damage.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When I use my weapon, I hit for 17 damage per turn. No more. This hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;changed since I first got the weapon (4 levels ago) and doesn&#39;t change when<br/>
&gt;my 1H slashing, offense, strength, or dexterity goes up. Why don&#39;t these<br/>
&gt;stats affect what damage I can inflict?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>17 per damage means that your weapon&#39;s damage is 8. it will never change,<br/>
Strength , will mean you hit for the high-end of the damage pool more often<br/>
(remember, this weapon can hit for 1 to 17 points, it doesnt have to hit for<br/>
17 every time) and your dex, and weapon and offense skills simply mean that<br/>
you will hit more often, and hit creatures with a higher AC.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I miss a lot. Up to 8 times in a row sometimes. Because of this, creatures<br/>
&gt;thay /con blue often win the battle. What can I do to miss less?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>try training your weapon skill at your guild trainer, also, try building up<br/>
offense, this is a royal pain in the keister, as you can&#39;t train Offense at<br/>
your guild, but i find my offense goes up faster if my weapon skill is<br/>
capped.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is there any documentation anywhere that shows the numbers game? In UO the<br/>
&gt;player guide simply had things like WeaponDmage * Skill + 10 = Damage. That<br/>
&gt;would be very useful to me. Does it exist anywhere?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, not exactly, but you will find alot of helpful statistics at<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Again, if you know the answer to even one of these, please post! Thanks!<br/>
