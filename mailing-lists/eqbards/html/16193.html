eliminate fight duration as a variable.  In quick fights you<br/>
lose DoT mana:damage efficiency, but a group with a necro will<br/>
*always* be able to handle anything the necro could handle<br/>
solo (unless they&#39;re stupid).<br/>

&gt; a much higher &#39;survival time&#39; than any melee class enjoys.  I&#39;ve seen necros<br/>
&gt; fight npcs far longer than my ranger or my bard can.  Because they can hurt<br/>
&gt; their oponent while healing themselves and their pet.  Pluss the pet gives<br/>
&gt; them a &#39;pocket tank&#39;.<br/>

over a necro?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your loss then.  The only multipliers in this game are bards<br/>
(group effects), Clarity, and stat buffs (which have minimal<br/>
effect).  Everything else is addative.  If a necro can solo a<br/>
mob that otherwise requires a group of 2+, making him group<br/>
with someone to do it cannot suddenly make him impotent.<br/>
