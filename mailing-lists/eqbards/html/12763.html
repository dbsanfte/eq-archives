<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796190927"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; carrilon also, once I used it on a dubious and didn&#39;t get my flute<br/>
&gt; equipped before pulse, and she was only indifferent.  Repulsed with flute,<br/>
&gt; and she was amiable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I definitely need to test this again, because the flute made no<br/>
  difference whatsoever in any faction adjustments when I used it<br/>
  in the past.  Dubious to amiable?  Are you sure?  That&#39;s a bit<br/>
  much.  <br/>
