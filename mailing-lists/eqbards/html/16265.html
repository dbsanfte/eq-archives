&gt;<br/>
&gt;Back in my early 20&#39;s I met a cleric in Mistmoore who told the group he<br/>
&gt;planned to specialize in evocation and had chosen a cleric because<br/>
&gt;Wizards couldn&#39;t wear enough armor. I think he made it to the mid 30&#39;s<br/>
&gt;before his reputation as the cleric who didn&#39;t heal kept him from<br/>
&gt;getting groups anywhere.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At least for the first few months of a server&#39;s life, it&#39;s a very small<br/>
&gt;world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He probably restarted as a druid.<br/>

<br/>
I know my druid is sitting flat on her butt medding for mana most<br/>
all the time. And most all of her mana goes to healing people!<br/>
She will snare and damage shield the main tank and everything<br/>
else is healing and keeping buffs up (And if I have a Shaman along,<br/>
I let the Shaman buff and focus more on healing)<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT looking forward to when my healing no longer does as much<br/>
good.<br/>
