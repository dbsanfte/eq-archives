<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066434105">Ok this is too tempting.....Mountain Time for me though ...<br/>
<br/>
		5:45  <br/>
		Get home, turn on pc.  Open cupboards looking for something<br/>
that can cook in the time it takes my pc to boot.  Fail miserably.  Decide I<br/>
don&#39;t really need to eat anyway.<br/>
<br/>
		5:55<br/>
		Log in and start yelling for a group<br/>
<br/>
		6:00<br/>
		&quot;What is all this lag?  Christ...  doh, 2,000 people on each<br/>
server, go Verant!  Way to keep up with demand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
		6:30<br/>
		Finally get a group, time to fight and flirt :-)<br/>
<br/>
		7:00 <br/>
		Housemate 1 comes home.  <br/>
		Asks &quot;you going to play that game all night AGAIN&quot;... <br/>
		Me: &quot;Huh?  What?  Sec, fight&quot;<br/>
<br/>
		9:00<br/>
		Housemate 2 &quot;How can you stand playing this all night... <br/>
		&#39;the purpose of life is a life of purpose&#39;... <br/>
		you need to get a life and be productive  <br/>
		.....Oh oh oh oh KILL THAT (you  KNOW he wants to play :-))<br/>
<br/>
		10:00<br/>
		Housemate 2 comes in completely pissed that the vcr messed<br/>
up the tape of the latest Buffy episode (note: he&#39;s 32).  I resist the urge<br/>
to ask what the &quot;purpose&quot; of Buffy is.<br/>
<br/>
		11:30<br/>
		I should go to bed... I&#39;m really addicted and need to stop <br/>
		(half hearted attempt at self-discipline)<br/>
<br/>
		1:00<br/>
		Wow the servers are clearing out a bit!  Just a few more<br/>
kills....<br/>
