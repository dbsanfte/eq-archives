<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649695878">so Broon used to stop running at 25% with chain/fear, but then a little<br/>
higher in level it was at 50%?  guess i should know better than to dispute<br/>
John! ;)<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve never noticed anything other than at 50% myself, i wonder what level it<br/>
is if it changes.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I distinctly recall this not being the case early on because<br/>
&gt; once in Cazic, I tried to Chain a green guard (stupid group<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t all fighting the same target), and he ended up getting<br/>
&gt; far enough away to aggro enough mobs to force us to zone.  I<br/>
&gt; also used the chain/fear combo on Broon whenever I passed<br/>
&gt; through EK, and was somewhat surprised when he suddenly<br/>
&gt; stopped running at 50% as opposed to the 25% or so I&#39;d grown<br/>
&gt; used to.<br/>
