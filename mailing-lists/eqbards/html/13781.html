&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m now level 40, my wife&#39;s wood elf warrior is 38 going on 39 and my<br/>
&gt; &gt;brother&#39;s druid is 37.  Until now, we&#39;ve had no problems finding places <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;hunt.  Sol A kings room, Lower Guk BR, MM, CT, Perma, etc.  When one is<br/>
&gt; &gt;camped we would simply go to another.  We haven&#39;t had problems finding a<br/>
&gt; &gt;spot since we&#39;ve graduated from aviaks at 23.  Now that I&#39;ve hit 40 and <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;non-green spots in each of these are camped, we have to go elsewhere to <br/>
&gt;get<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;xp.  My brother is a druid, so he pulls out the spell book and we go off <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;flying looking for places to hunt.  Zone into sol b and everything is <br/>
&gt;camped<br/>
&gt; &gt;but the circle room.   That sucked with a whole 4 miserable spawns every <br/>
&gt;25<br/>
&gt; &gt;or so minutes ASSUMING that someone from noble or pool didn&#39;t pull one of<br/>
&gt; &gt;our precious few spawns first.  Zone into lower guk and everything is <br/>
&gt;camped<br/>
&gt; &gt;including the live side bridge.  Zone into Ogguk to find two groups <br/>
&gt;already<br/>
&gt; &gt;sharing bouncers, one with a waiting list and the other made up of two <br/>
&gt;high<br/>
&gt; &gt;40&#39;s not interested in more, spectres taken, dw gobs in oasis camped, <br/>
&gt;giants<br/>
&gt; &gt;boring, Kithicor is nap time in the day and horrible xp at night, troll<br/>
&gt; &gt;guards camped and boring... Paw was even crowded and we don&#39;t know the <br/>
&gt;zone<br/>
&gt; &gt;well enough to find those places where a level 40 can hunt without <br/>
&gt;pulling<br/>
&gt; &gt;trains from hell and half the place cons green.  Worst part is that a <br/>
&gt;huge<br/>
&gt; &gt;portion of the populous in most of these areas were level 45 to 50 trying <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;farm items or fill the xp bar for the next plane raid.  If the PoF, PoH, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;PoS are supposed to help eliviate the high level dungeon over crowding, <br/>
&gt;then<br/>
&gt; &gt;they have not accomplished their goal.  Not being a college student and<br/>
&gt; &gt;having 2 kids, I don&#39;t have the option of getting on at 2 in the <br/>
&gt;afternoon<br/>
&gt; &gt;and squawting a spot until my group logs on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just Imagine.... A Global solution to most major problems with Everquest =P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What if, just what if Verant in there ultimate wisdom (heh)decided to throw<br/>
&gt;a hardcap on all Servers of say 1500 peeps. Now this would most likely<br/>
&gt;require an initial investment on Verant&#39;s part for new servers to<br/>
&gt;accomodate the surplus of people that were left over, but, a hardcap solves<br/>
&gt;everyone&#39;s problems (well most) I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Camping becomes a non-issue due to the fact that people who want experience<br/>
&gt;would easily be able to find a new place to hunt that would yeild good<br/>
&gt;exp.It&#39;s safe to say that not everybody will be on at once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lag becomes a non-issue as well due to the reduction in the amount of peeps<br/>
&gt;on at any one time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Link Dead&#39;s should be minimized for the above reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m sure there are other things that would be alleviated with this kind of<br/>
&gt;change, and the only thing I can think of that would detract from something<br/>
&gt;like this is if peeps wanted to bring in friends on their server. However,<br/>
&gt;this could be accomodated by allowing a character transfer of some sort<br/>
&gt;once a month to a server that wasn&#39;t at full capacity. Then the friends<br/>
&gt;could cooridinate what server to transfer to. It seems at least as far as<br/>
&gt;this last part is concerned, they are heading in the general direction. I<br/>
&gt;just don&#39;t see anything getting better by simply adding more servers. The<br/>
&gt;population is just going to max out (and then some) and the same problems<br/>
&gt;will come up again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The bottom line is that regardless of what Verant says, there is no cap.<br/>
&gt;Initially it was 1500, then a few months ago it became 2000, and now who<br/>
&gt;really knows, I guess Fennin Ro was up over 3000 this weekend. There is no<br/>
&gt;cap at all. The game is great, but it could be that much better and IMHO<br/>
&gt;many of these problems would be taken care of with a hard cap on all<br/>
&gt;servers or better yet, hehe, how about just some servers if Verant is<br/>
&gt;worried about spending more money for all the servers I am proposing, how<br/>
&gt;about servers with a hard cap but with an increased monthly fee. I know I<br/>
&gt;would pay much more money a month to play Everquest on server with a cap.<br/>
&gt;Would you?<br/>
