currently no games in production with a greater than 50% chance of being <br/>
published that I am interested in.  Either the companies are not reliable <br/>
enough (Verant, Artifact-Entertainment), or the game itself appears to be <br/>
poorly implemented (AO, HJ, Origin)<br/>

Ahh well, more time to play the other games I got.<br/>
