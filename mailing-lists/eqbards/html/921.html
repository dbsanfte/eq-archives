    there is a guy by a fountain in south karana (loc 5700, 2600).  starts with him.  no one on my server has it yet though, very tough quest so it seems.<br/>

        I am trying to figure out where the quest begins for the level 30 song, I suspected HighPass Hold library but the man said I was a stranger and would not talk to me, can anyone give me a hint or even tell me where I begin this quest?<br/>
