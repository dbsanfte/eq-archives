<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-609579630">Yes I too would agree.  I would much rather not die so easily rather than<br/>
just waste less time after an inevitable death.  With the current taunting<br/>
rules I have given up totally on pickup groups.  All it takes is one screwup<br/>
by anyone in a pickup group and most of the casters, who have little loyalty<br/>
to their groupmates, gate out.  The melee guys aren&#39;t being targeted anyhow<br/>
so usually make it out.  As the main focus of mob anger I however end up<br/>
buying the farm.  Nothing like having group leader scream &quot;Bad Pull,<br/>
everyone zone!&quot;, only to see 3 casters gate out and 2 melee types including<br/>
the puller run for the zone while the horde of critters bears down on you.<br/>
Note to the wise, Lullaby will not save you from a train of 12 familiars in<br/>
Mistmoore at level 21.  Neither will Accelerando.  Not to mention the<br/>
Deathly Ancilles train that got me later when the casters gated out right in<br/>
front of me with nary a word.  Needless to say I need a bigger ignore list<br/>
now.<br/>

Aye, that&#39;s exactly what I wanted when I started this thread.  I&#39;d much<br/>
rather<br/>
be a real  Hybrid with additional _defensive_ skills, rather than given<br/>
bind.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll take either.  The end of the original post says that we get the<br/>
downside of both types.  Fixing either is fine with me :)<br/>

i think he is using a bind argument in order to really say we could use just<br/>
1 more defensive skill, such as parry.  i agree that we should get parry and<br/>
have it capped around the same as our dodge (125?).  it would just put us<br/>
one very small notch towards a melee class, which i do think we are far more<br/>
than a cleric or shaman.  i&#39;ve always thought we should not get bind, and<br/>
all the reasons for and against have already been gone over a million times.<br/>
