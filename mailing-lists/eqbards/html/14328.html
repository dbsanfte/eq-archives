<b>Subject:</b> Melee groups.. Can they do anything? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471469589"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thats funny.  My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>
&gt;&gt; assertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>
&gt;&gt; Paladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>
&gt;&gt; types, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>
&gt;&gt; time thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>
&gt;&gt; levels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>
&gt;&gt; spread the damage around quite well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I used to be in groups like this back in the early days in Cazic before<br/>
&gt;rubicite fever swept the servers. Usually we&#39;d have a group of whoever<br/>
&gt;showed up, and it was commonly all melee/hybrid types as the casters<br/>
&gt;were all still in Unrest. It can be quite effective and quite fun. You<br/>
&gt;get to use songs you wouldn&#39;t normally use.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do the same right now.. Hunting in CZ and often in straight Melee/Hybrid<br/>
groups, and I must say its much more fun than being grouped with a bunch of<br/>
casters that is used to soloing and thus burns all their mana in the start of<br/>
the fights which only results in two things:<br/>
1. Lots of downtime because of them medding<br/>
2. They get bashed pretty good by the mobs until we (tanks and semi tanks) can<br/>
get em of them.<br/>
<br/>
Offcourse there is nothing that beats a well balanced group where people know<br/>
how to work together, but a straight melee/hybrid group is much easier to get to<br/>
work together and with little downtime.<br/>
There is vitually no downtime and when people knows when to taunt and when to<br/>
back off - Hymn with a mandoline heals a massive amount of health each round..<br/>
Further more our speedup songs really get to show their worth (Currently using<br/>
Anthem the Arms).  One group I have been with in CZ resently constisted of:<br/>
ranger, SK, SK, warrior and me (Bard) we all ranged from 30 to 35. We pulled to<br/>
CY from pool and had virtually no downtime.. It got even better when a Cleric<br/>
joined us :o)<br/>
