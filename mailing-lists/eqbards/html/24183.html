&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; by the way, what would be the reasoning behind giving us more power <br/>
&gt;with this song?  how would it help balance the classes as a whole by <br/>
&gt;giving us more damage? shada i believe said we are already balanced <br/>
&gt;or even overpowered in the non uber raid arena.  how would this not <br/>
&gt;make us overpowered or overpower us even more in this area?  how <br/>
&gt;would this even help us in the uber raid area since most nonlure type <br/>
&gt;damage spells are heavily resisted anyway?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I suppose the same reasoning VI used when they upgraded (lol) the <br/>
&gt;damage DDD is doing.  But, my intent with the change in topic is to <br/>
&gt;find out just what would be considered worthwhile for this song.  <br/>
&gt;Everyone is saying it sucks.  What would make it _not_ suck.  I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt;really concerned with it making us overpowered in a non-uber raid <br/>
&gt;environment... I want to find out what changes it would take for 90%+ <br/>
&gt;of the Bards to mem this song.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how can you consider that without taking into account if it even has a chance<br/>
to be implemented or whether it&#39;s balanced?  i mean, ok here, let&#39;s make it the<br/>
normal recast time of any normal bard song and have it do 1500 damage to a <br/>
single target and make it save against poison instead of magic.  now 90+% of <br/>
bards will mem  this song, heh.  now you might say &#39;&#39;that&#39;s ridiculous&#39;&#39;, to which<br/>
i would agree, but why is it ridiculous?  because it&#39;s not balanced.  because<br/>
it&#39;s not realistic.  then you could get into the whole debate as to whether all<br/>
songs need to have 90% of a class use it or not, but i guess that&#39;s another topic.<br/>
