<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833508206"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I do not know how many of the buffs overwrite higher level enchanter buffs<br/>
&gt; as my enchanter is still lower level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Almost all similar level enchanter buffs are stronger than the bards<br/>
  comparable song.  However, an enchanter must use mana and cast on all<br/>
  the party members, the bard doesn&#39;t have either of those two<br/>
  constraints.<br/>
<br/>
  Think of the mana cost of Swift Like the Wind (L49 Enchanter) x 3<br/>
  [assuming 3 tanks]... god that&#39;s over 2 bubbles of mana if I remember<br/>
  correctly, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  And the mana cost of Verses of Victory (L50 bard)... one click, 3 secs,<br/>
  no mana, boom.  It&#39;s not SLTW, but it&#39;s damn close. (plus it has ac,<br/>
  str, and agi buffs)<br/>
<br/>
  I would rather have my enchanter mezzing and stunning mobs than<br/>
  worrying about SLTW requests when my song is for all purposes <br/>
  not as good, but very similar.<br/>
<br/>

  <br/>
  Some more advice...<br/>
<br/>
  The one thing that absolutely breaks up a shaman/enchanter debuff<br/>
  (drowsy line) is binding, chains, and cessation.  Do not use either<br/>
  of these songs if your shaman/enchanter is debuffing the mobs attack<br/>
  speed or you will return it back to it&#39;s normal speed after your<br/>
  song wears off.  (when something turns to run, then chain it if it&#39;s<br/>
  not already snared, thats one exception at the very end of the battle)<br/>
