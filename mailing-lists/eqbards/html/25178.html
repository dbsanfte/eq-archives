<div id="ygrps-yiv-679500180">One way to &quot;test&quot; which is better is to fight the same mob both ways (well,<br/>
if you can.)  Hunter & Forager Frooglaks are good test mobs (and great exp<br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of root - dotting (since I usually have my cleric with my bard.)<br/>
Pull mob, root it, back off and dot it.  Alternatively, you can pull mob,<br/>
melee it, get chealed.  Or pull mob, snare it, fear it and chase it.  Try<br/>
all of these methods and see which one kills the mob faster.  What I found,<br/>
given mobs that have zero or low resists, root dotting is by far the &#39;best&#39;<br/>
in that the mobs die faster and there is virtually no down time between<br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
In a group, they like to &quot;see&quot; damage, especially if they have other&#39;s hits<br/>
turned on.  If they don&#39;t see numbers on the screen, they don&#39;t think you<br/>
are doing anything.  Also, seeing you with your drum (stick) and no weapons<br/>
(no exaggereatedly huge sionaches or breathe of harmony), they think you are<br/>
not contributing.  So then you can tell them that your 3 chants do about<br/>
1800 dmg per minute. And ya, 60 levels later, 210 days and still explaining<br/>
to the groups: &quot;... my bard mana song *is* the same as Clarity-2, the &#39;you<br/>
feel smaller&#39; *adds* 35 AC to all of you, etc, etc.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;ve always wondered about what is truly the most effective damage output.<br/>
Obviously what weapon you use is a major factor.  I do find that when I&#39;m in<br/>
a caster heavy group - its good to melee just to keep the mob parked and<br/>
aggroed if possible.  I &quot;only&quot; have a Nestrolo Tambo and have had decent<br/>
ratio weaps for some time (esp since Sunday with my new Guardians Mace) -<br/>
but when I was using a Blood Runed Short Sword (9/18) and a Sioniches<br/>
Partisan (9/19) Tried both weaps and chants in The Hole and the party &quot;felt&quot;<br/>
that I did more damage with the weapons.  Also this was at level 54 - and<br/>
I&#39;m sure that is a major factor on chant damage output as well...<br/>
<br/>
This was FAR from scientific - but was kind of interesting none-the-less.<br/>
