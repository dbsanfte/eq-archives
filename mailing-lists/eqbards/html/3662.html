&gt; &gt; Maybe your friend accidentally con&#39;d a kodiak or something.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I had a chance to /con Kizdean Gix last night with my 16th level bard and he<br/>
&gt; con&#39;d yellow. I&#39;d say he either has a wide level range or they lowered his<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I probably just have a faulty memory as it&#39;s been a while. He probably<br/>
con&#39;d blue but put up such a fight he felt like a yellow. =)<br/>
