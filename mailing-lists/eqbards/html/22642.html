It&#39;s found off of Regis, a rare spawn in North Karana. Kill Zahal the Vile (another rare spawn in North Karana) to make Regis spawn.<br/>

The flute is a quest item which you give to the gyspsy, Lianna Ferasa, in Rathe Mtns in return for the Icon of the Reverent, which is required for the Cleric&#39;s Bracers of the Reverent quest from the Temple of Solusek Ro.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, never tested it for effects.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I may have missed it, but have you included your url for the various commands? It&#39;s a very handy list that would help with the twisting commands.<br/>
