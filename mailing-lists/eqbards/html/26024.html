My replay sounds harsh now that I&#39;ve sent it.  Didn&#39;t mean for it to look that way.  But do consider that this list is made up of people who have enjoyed playing bards.<br/>
If it takes the combined efforts of this list to convince you that this is a good class to play, your gaming efforts are probably better spent on another class.  EQ is meant to be fun and this list is about playing your bard effectively.  So if you want to know how to use those songs ... let me assure you that you&#39;ve come to the right list.<br/>

Your compliant is noted.  On that note (heheh) here&#39;s a thought for you:   <br/>
Playing a bard isn&#39;t for everyone.  You might be happier playing a different class.<br/>

My complaint is that the boring span is longer than any other caster at that<br/>
level range. Intcasters get three sets of useful spells during that boring<br/>
span, wiscasters two, and even with hybrids they get spells at nine, then<br/>
fifteen, then twenty two, never having to go eight levels without anything useful.<br/>
