<div id="ygrps-yiv-250604119">Lets see if I understand you correctly:<br/>
<br/>
640 items per account, roughly doubled to include bank and inventory slots = 1280 items. (Assumes each character on the account is maxed in items, very unlikely, as was stated.)<br/>
<br/>
Each item, by your conservative estimate, is actually a 4byte +1 bit data structure. Lets be generous and make it an 8 byte structure.<br/>
<br/>
1280 8-byte structures per account is roughly 10 Kbytes. Assume 3000 accounts on a server, makes about 3 Megabytes of data. This is a lot to back up???? That data wouldn&#39;t even fill 3 standard floppy disks. I don&#39;t believe data storage or it&#39;s manipulation such as backup is a problem given those parameters.<br/>

640 items ( the correct product of 8x8x10) per account, double that with<br/>
bank and inventory plus wearables, would be devastating in terms of storage<br/>
space even if every item was a simple 2 byte ID code and a 1 byte quantity<br/>
and a 1 bit flag for bank/inventory and another byte (at least) for<br/>
container location.  <br/>
Also I doubt they based their storage estimates on the max, but rather the<br/>
mean.  1 character at max inventory, 2 more at 50% (maybe) per account on<br/>
one server.  I could have 8 characters maxed on every server with just one<br/>
account.  <br/>
The theory is that many people have created mule characters for their<br/>
primarys just to serve as bankers thus way overblowing their original<br/>
estimates.<br/>
Part of the problem isn&#39;t so much the physical space required though, as the<br/>
backup time required to conserve all that data every nite routinely.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s been an interesting topic among the developers here at work.  they<br/>
&gt; had a different take from everyone else on the proliferation of No Drop<br/>
&gt; items.  There is a group here who believe it is the enormous number of<br/>
&gt; items<br/>
&gt; ever growing in the character databases that Verant is concerned about.<br/>
&gt; By<br/>
&gt; making them No Drop they were trying to keep the number of in game objects<br/>
&gt; down.  An interesting speculation and a reason why it took so long to get<br/>
&gt; the bank set up to accept No Drop items perhaps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	The problem with that theory is that there&#39;s only such much any one<br/>
person can keep.  8 characters x 8 bank slots x 10 backpack slots = 6400<br/>
items, plus the items on the 8 characters, per account, per shard.  Of<br/>
course this is exluding stackable items, but light-stones aren&#39;t stackable.<br/>
Stackable items can only increase this by 20 fold, assuming that everything<br/>
you owned was stackable.<br/>
