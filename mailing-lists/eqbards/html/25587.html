<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542909922">At 23 I loved soloing the gargoyles in OOT. Depending on your server, they <br/>
may be camped all the time or never camped. I don&#39;t remember if I had to <br/>
bellow/kite one a bit to get it&#39;s life down before I started all instrument <br/>
attack on it, probably depends on your equipment.<br/>
<br/>
To get to this island, you get on the boat at Freeport. Once in OOT, hop <br/>
off at first stop (Sister Island). Then swim South by Southwest and you&#39;ll <br/>
see the island. You&#39;ll need to clear the skels to get gargoyles to spawn. <br/>
Incidentally, before you camp, leave a couple of gargoyles on the island. <br/>
They&#39;ll kill the skeletons so that the next person just has gargoyles.<br/>
<br/>
You just need to be careful as to where you kite them as bellow/kiting can <br/>
be monotonous. Good money and exp though. A partner never hurts out here <br/>
either.<br/>

&gt;My bard has stalled recently (never heard that one before, eh?).  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;looking for a NEW zone that a Level 23 bard can successfully solo - AND GAIN<br/>
&gt;EXP - without spending a lot of time on CR&#39;s.  I&#39;ve been hunting in Dagnor&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Cauldron on Veeshan but the goblins are far between and it&#39;s been slow<br/>
&gt;going.  One advantage (or disadvantage) is the zone is ALWAYS empty, only<br/>
&gt;peeps passing to Estate of Unrest ever appear.  I&#39;ve had troubles hooking up<br/>
&gt;with friends due to RL hours and stuff so grouping if kindof out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been travelling to BB and GF to help out the newbies and work on my<br/>
&gt;skills but the experience isn&#39;t there.  I&#39;ve been to SK and LoIO which was<br/>
&gt;fairly successful, I&#39;d recommend it to anyone of similar level.  But I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;looking for something NEW!  --  Any suggestions?  Locations?  Just drawing<br/>
&gt;on all you highbies overwhelming knowledge.. /bows.<br/>
&gt;--<br/>
&gt;Also -- as I recommended to my guildies.. make sure you change the<br/>
&gt;EQCLIENT.INI file to support DirectX8 and log into the Test Server to make<br/>
&gt;sure you&#39;re system requirements are up to snuff.  I had an older system that<br/>
&gt;was running XP on a 3Dfx board (no current drivers available due to<br/>
&gt;out-of-business) and it choked when I tried this.  Directions for making the<br/>
&gt;change are in the patch message (you DID read them, right?).  The update to<br/>
&gt;DirectX8 will happen whether you upgrade to SoL or not, better to test now<br/>
&gt;and get the bugs worked out then the day they make the switch over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my 2cp..<br/>
