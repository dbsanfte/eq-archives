<b>Subject:</b> we are so fun! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-366183279">Because I have been rather bored lately (I can&#39;t play eq till Monday cause my good comp is boffoed) I was reading a bunch of the message boards at Eq Stractics, and it dawned on me.<br/>
We are the funnest class to play in the game!  we are not like the mages - sit, meditate, stand, cast, repeat.  and we are not like the meleers - slash, slash, bash, slash, sit, sit, sit, sit ,sit repeat. we are the best of both.<br/>
 And the fact that our spells cover such a diverse range, it makes it fun to look forward to a new type of song.  I haven&#39;t been able to play eq for 3 weeks (2 weeks vacation, 1 week of boffoed computer) and I am in serious withdrawal, but I will have my happy go lucky orange little bard to play when I finally can!<br/>
