&gt;There is at least 3 ways to the evil eye :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most of the +cha items of worth are enchanter made, other items<br/>
&gt;include the crude stein...<br/>
&gt;I think you can very easily get up to +60 charisma with only these.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Last night I died at the EE in lower guk.  A pair of necros helped clear<br/>
&gt;&gt; the way to my corpse (one of the frogs in jail could see invis).  My job<br/>
&gt;&gt; was to chain the frogs and minos.  Blue frogs resisted at least<br/>
&gt;50% if not<br/>
&gt;&gt; more without the charisma gear on my corpse (human, put a few points in<br/>
&gt;&gt; cha, don&#39;t remember offhand, geared is 137).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; After this incident, I am on a quest to gather as much charisma equipment<br/>
&gt;&gt; as possible.  There are very few items we can wear that increase charisma<br/>
&gt;&gt; in some slots (belt, back, shoulders, next to if not nothing).  The<br/>
&gt;&gt; dexterity items that are available are excruciatingly rare drops, dragon<br/>
&gt;&gt; drops, or plane stuff.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I would highly recommend for starting buffs to use points in dex and cha.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Strength is important yes, and you&#39;ll find yourself near encumbrance with<br/>
&gt;&gt; only armor on, especially with bronze.  I myself wore a full suit of<br/>
&gt;&gt; bronze at one point (sans helm, chain is tolerable for now but plate is<br/>
&gt;&gt; unbearable on human), and was left with maybe 4 stones worth of weight<br/>
&gt;&gt; till encumbrance set in (presong).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; This period will pass.  If you bear with it, and suffer the weight, maybe<br/>
&gt;&gt; pick up a few +3str gold amber earrings or whatever the rings are for the<br/>
&gt;&gt; interim, a bloodstained mantle, studded collar (the +3 one, whatever that<br/>
&gt;&gt; was, maybe spiked), in the long run you&#39;ll be much happier having boosted<br/>
&gt;&gt; your other attributes instead of strength.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; This assuming you spend most of your gametime at a relatively<br/>
&gt;higher level<br/>
&gt;&gt; (&gt;20).  If you&#39;re an extremely slow leveller, strength might be better of<br/>
&gt;&gt; an attribute to contribute toward your utility gained from playing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So where might I find a Siryn Hair Hood?  EQlizer mentioned<br/>
&gt;&quot;rare spawn in<br/>
&gt;&gt; Rathe Mountains,&quot; but no name was given.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Athren Notechaser, 37 measures and still composing<br/>
&gt;&gt; &lt;The Revolution&gt; of Cazic-Thule<br/>
