<div id="ygrps-yiv-210331583">On the brewers list, someone posted an extensive list of all the new foraged<br/>
items.  Just about every zone has one.  What they can be used for (baking,<br/>
brewing, poisons) remains to be discovered.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Everyone knows that Bard forage caps at 40 right?  There is some concern<br/>
&gt; floating about that a minimum skill of 100 in forage is required to get<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; new unique items people are finding in the different zones.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a bit of good news, I foraged an &quot;ash root&quot; last night (I think it<br/>
&gt; was in Kithcor) and later foraged a normal &quot;root&quot; in HighKeep.  They were<br/>
&gt; definitely separate items and did not stack with one another (much like<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; old berries and fruit that have been around and have the same graphic).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any other bards on this list found any of the unique new forage items yet<br/>
&gt; too?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW - my forage is maxed at the cap, 40.<br/>
