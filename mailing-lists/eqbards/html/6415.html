<br/>
Yeah, and while I don&#39;t really care about the kiting debate as I have never<br/>
kited before and am not concerned about it...after experiencing the wondrous<br/>
awe of fear/chain I would HATE to lose it.  <br/>
<br/>
Its really not a good idea in dungeons and lots of mobs still randomly<br/>
resist chains so its not foolproof, but used as an emergency tactic to turn<br/>
the battle I think it is invaluable.  <br/>
<br/>
Not that I am saying I it will be taken away, but as we all know, stranger<br/>
things have happened ;-)<br/>

&gt; Sorry, was commenting to the most recent post in the thread.  <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; problem with it either, just wondered why anyone was <br/>
&gt; questioning Fear/Chains<br/>
&gt; valididty or calling it cheesy when its no different from <br/>
&gt; Fear/Root which<br/>
&gt; Enchanters can do at much lower level.  I agree with you it <br/>
&gt; seems perfectly<br/>
&gt; valid to me.<br/>
