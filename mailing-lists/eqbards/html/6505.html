&gt; Second time Ive made the list so far woohoo :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Last night I had the opportunity and the unexpected pleasure of grouping<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a level 30 bard in Cazic. *waves to Celandro*  We were doing crocs<br/>
&gt; &gt; and praying to the EQ gods for the steel golem to spawn and drop some<br/>
&gt; gloves<br/>
&gt; &gt; for our cleric friend.<br/>
