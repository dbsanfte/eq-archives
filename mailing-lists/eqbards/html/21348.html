<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823711525">Fortunately most of my friends agree on this, so they won&#39;t be all that<br/>
interested in EQ2 either.  I have no desire to try Star Wars Online, or to<br/>
play another Verant game.  They have the worst customer service I have ever<br/>
seen and an even worse attitude towards their customers.<br/>

heh i also find it amusing people come out and say &#39;&#39;I will NEVER buy<br/>
another Verant<br/>
game!&#39;&#39; and then in the next sentence they say well i will probly try star<br/>
wars online, heh.<br/>
and out of all the people who say this kind of stuff, if your friends from<br/>
EQ buy EQ2 and<br/>
spend a lot of time playing it, you won&#39;t join them?  how would that be any<br/>
different than<br/>
paying 10 bucks per month now?<br/>
