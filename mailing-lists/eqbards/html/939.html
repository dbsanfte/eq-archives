<div id="ygrps-yiv-606601995">I&#39;ve played on Bristlebane since it was brought up and the server is<br/>
great.  There are a large group of us that have leveled fairly slowly,<br/>
but enjoyed every minute of it.  We roleplay quite a bit and even our<br/>
EQVault board is fun to join in on.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a character on the Rodcet Nife server that I created when<br/>
it first came up.  Several of my RL friends were scattered on other<br/>
servers and we decided to start fresh characters on RN so we could get<br/>
together.  That server has also been quite fun, though I suppose I feel<br/>
a little more loyal to Bristlebane.  I&#39;ve noticed ALOT of former old<br/>
timers from Fennin Ro, etc have moved to Rodcet Nife for the very<br/>
reason you spoke of... they&#39;ve done the powergame thing and they want a<br/>
change.  Almost like retiring to Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would highly recommend either board if you&#39;re looking for a<br/>
good environment.  Are they Doodz-free? no, but then again none of the<br/>
boards really are.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your choice in finding a starting point.<br/>
