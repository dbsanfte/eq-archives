&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to think that singing the Mana song in battle is not worth it.<br/>
&gt; Figuring that you can twist three songs for the price of one Mana Song,<br/>
&gt; and that the Mana Song buys you an additional one-third of a spell for<br/>
&gt; each caster, the breakeven point should be at nine or more casters in<br/>
&gt; your party, which means never.  And that assumes that they are all OOM.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to disagree as well.  I was camping the Spirit room in Unrest and the<br/>
mobs were coming more or less continuously at some points.  With a<br/>
compentent cleric in the group he was medding constantly and only standing<br/>
up to heal before diving back into his book.  The amount of melee damage<br/>
that the warrior, paladin, druid and I was dishing out was fine.  Anthem,<br/>
Psalm, etc. wouldn&#39;t have contributed enough to justify denying the cleric<br/>
Clarity.  This cleric was calling &quot;2 mins to heal&quot;, &quot;1 min to heal&quot;, &quot;30<br/>
secs to heal&quot; and kept us informed the whole time.  It was wonderful.  The<br/>
only time I felt obligated to play something else was when a Hag joined the<br/>
party.  Then I twisted MR buffs and threw in the occassional (resisted)<br/>
Pixie Strike.<br/>
<br/>
You know it really gets my goat that a friggin&#39; blue undead resists me again<br/>
and again and again.  The live lizzies in Cazic hardly ever resist Strike.<br/>
I guess undead mobs are just different though, cause the ones in Kith resist<br/>
PS routinely as well.<br/>

&gt; If I have to pick one song to sing, it&#39;s probably Lullaby (which<br/>
&gt; impressed the heck out of a bunch of level 42-50s in Lower Guk the other<br/>
&gt; night - I was level 34 at the time).  I sing the Mana Song when we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; done.<br/>
