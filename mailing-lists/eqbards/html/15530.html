<b>Subject:</b> (OT) Easter Eggs again (Some spoilers!!!) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-753282944">As Easter approaches, I am collecting a list of &quot;easter eggs&quot; for <br/>
publication, and am asking for y&#39;alls input.  Following is the list I have <br/>
so far.  Because the nature of one or two of these as spoilers, I&#39;m giving <br/>
some spoiler space.  Note: The pictures of coordinates underneath many <br/>
zones does not count, what I&#39;m looking for are mostly &quot;pop-culture&quot; <br/>
references or things that are just downright silly.<br/>

Regional Eggs:<br/>
Of course, the original and classic: Qeynos = SonyEQ backwards.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the runes on the side of the Qeynos Clocktower, when translated, <br/>
say two things:  Ak&#39;anon Gnomes, and Qeynos.  Both are spelled backward, <br/>
and in Tolkein-style runes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Estate of Unrest&quot; - which is a homonym for &quot;A state of unrest&quot; - which one <br/>
could say all of the residents are in.<br/>
<br/>
On the walls of Blackburrow (and other places) you can see the &quot;fossilized&quot; <br/>
skeleton of the Alien from Alien.<br/>
<br/>
Underneath Befallen, there is a picture of a cat&#39;s head.  This is supposed <br/>
to belong to one of the programmers.<br/>
<br/>
Character Eggs:<br/>
<br/>
Bait Masterson - this is a reference to William Barclay &quot;Bat&quot; Masterson, <br/>
the American frontier lawman known for his good looks and ivory-handled <br/>
pistols.<br/>
<br/>
Princess Lenya/Lenia.  If you hail Lenya, she says &quot;Aren&#39;t you a little <br/>
short for a High Keep Guard?&quot;  This is a reference to Princess Leia in Star <br/>
Wars.<br/>
<br/>
Guards Regis(?) and Philbin in the Qeynos area.<br/>
<br/>
Bard that is at the fountain in South Karana is named Vhalen which could be <br/>
interpreted as an abbreviation for Van Halen.<br/>
<br/>
The bard that you get the good sell prices from in Freeport is named Jekel <br/>
Enheid (unverified)<br/>
<br/>
In Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, the four characters who stand around the campfire - <br/>
when the High Elf attacks, he shouts &quot;Fabulous Four, attack!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cubert is the name of a Gelatinous Cube under Qeynos.  This is a reference <br/>
to a video game from the 80&#39;s - &quot;Q-bert&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is apparently a  skeleton that says &quot;Never fear...Smyth <br/>
isss...Here!!&quot; (for all you Lost in Space fans).  (One of the skellies in <br/>
SK just a little south of the bridge).  This is unverified.<br/>
<br/>
Phrase to say to to Kizdean Gix to get the note for Lrodd is &quot;utalk adarev <br/>
otcin&quot;. This is a misspelling of the quote from the movie, &quot;The Day the <br/>
Earth Stood Still.&quot;  The words spelled backwards are &quot;klatu verada nicto&quot;, <br/>
which is close to the actual quote: &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay guys - let&#39;s see what you have!<br/>
