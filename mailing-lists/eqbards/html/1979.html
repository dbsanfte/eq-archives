Worst case, it&#39;s about two hours round trip from Freeport to<br/>
Crushbone and getting a shot a Dvinn.  In an equivalent amount<br/>
of time, my friends and I can currently rake in about 20-30pp<br/>
of loot killing general mobs.  If someone wants to charge me 5<br/>
hours of loot for an item that takes me 2 hours to get myself,<br/>
I will just get it myself in 2 hours and spend the remaining 3<br/>
hours enjoying the dirk and earning money for myself.<br/>

I really think you guys need to make Dvinn a rarer spawn, or<br/>
give him a different weapon most of the time instead of the<br/>
dirk.  The availability of the dirk is out of proportion to<br/>
the other special weapons in the game at that level.<br/>
