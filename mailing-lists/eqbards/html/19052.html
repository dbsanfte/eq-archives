I am wondering if anyone that has the Selo&#39;s Song of Travel has noticed the <br/>
animation acting funny. To me, it looks as if the animatioon for the silly <br/>
waddle and the arm waving are trying to go off at the same time, resulting <br/>
in my character leaning hard to one side sometimes or waddling erratically. <br/>
Is it just me?<br/>
<br/>
I finally went to my first plane Sunday. We went to Hate, overall had a <br/>
great time. We had around 35 players from at least 3 guilds but it went very <br/>
well due to a very experienced leader and pull team. I was the Only bard <br/>
there all day. Died 4 times but got rezzed back fast (all those clerics are <br/>
clarity addicts hehe). I got the Martune rapier, imbrued boots, and BP. The <br/>
Maestro went down easy, only dropped a monk mask. Innoruk however cleaned <br/>
all our clocks handily! So now I have on silvery legs and hero bracer since <br/>
my groups decided the lambent blue clashed with the imbrued. I really need <br/>
to find those singing steel gloves now!<br/>
