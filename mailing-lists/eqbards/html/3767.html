<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916663862">as to the nobles in paw.  They do drop snakeskin armor pieces, I killed 6-8 of them<br/>
and ended up with 3 jerkins which I sold for 7pp each, very nice considering the<br/>
ease of killing the nobles.  I strongly suggest CoD for this fight as there are two<br/>
nobles that spawn on top of each other.  Taking both out was quite easy when you<br/>
start fighting the second and he is at half life already... CoD is wonderful isnt<br/>
it. heh heh I am just figuring this out now and becoming more courageous in its<br/>
use. (it actually has a semi permanent spot on my song bar)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Money has NEVER been a problem for me... though granted I&#39;ve never seen more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than 50 platinum in any one place and it boggles my mind to see people<br/>
&gt; &gt; buying things through auction for 1000 plat or more.... what has been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem for ME is levelling.  Partied with my friends I have ALOT of fun but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I rarely get much of the experience from any given series of kills... which<br/>
&gt; &gt; only gets worse because they keep getting farther and farther ahead of me...<br/>
&gt; &gt; and since 12th level I&#39;ve been virtually incapable of soloing much of<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything that gives me experience without getting my butt killed.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing this game since the first week it went public, and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; my bard since the very day that the Bristlebane server opened... and she is<br/>
&gt; &gt; only 16th level.. about two bubbles from 17th.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So... anyone have any ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blues you should be able to solo at 16th (I&#39;m also 16th and solo all of these):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Elite orcs in crushbone<br/>
&gt; Elite gnolls in blackburrow<br/>
&gt; Nobles in paw (exceptional loot)<br/>
&gt; Mammoth calves in everfrost<br/>
&gt; Elephant calves in south karana<br/>
&gt; Lion patriarchs/matriarchs in east karana<br/>
&gt; Beatles (borer?) in north karana<br/>
&gt; Alligators in oasis<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots more but these are the things I concentrate on when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; soloing in the various areas.<br/>
