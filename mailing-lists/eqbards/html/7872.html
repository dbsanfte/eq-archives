<div id="ygrps-yiv-122081289">I have a question for you Kitasi (or anyone else), where do you get your<br/>
spider silks?  Do you actually have to go out and kill innumerable giant<br/>
spiders, or is there a place you can just buy these and cut out all the<br/>
running around?<br/>
<br/>
For example...I have been working on baking lately and I had saved up about<br/>
80 fresh fish I had caught and after trying to kill bats (for their wings)<br/>
on the order of obtaining about 80 batwings for &quot;fish rolls&quot; I finally gave<br/>
up and found a merchant selling batwings for cheap enough that I &quot;ate&quot; the<br/>
loss and bought a backpack full.  This is what I would like to do with<br/>
spider silks instead of running all over the place at level 29 killing<br/>
spiders like some kind of wild neurotic arachnophobe.<br/>
<br/>
Hints, suggestions?<br/>

&gt; Patchwork is all trivial at 26.  Raw silk begins triviality <br/>
&gt; at 33 (gloves,<br/>
&gt; mask) and is still not all trivial at 39.  Cured Silk does not begin<br/>
&gt; triviality until after at least 44 where I am now unless it <br/>
&gt; is the masks,<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t made one of those in a few points.  Also the raw silk <br/>
&gt; and Cured silk<br/>
&gt; will sell to vendors for about break even.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; suggest that unless<br/>
&gt; desperate though since the Cured is selling for 2-3pp per AC <br/>
&gt; point currently<br/>
&gt; (at least on E&#39;ci) and even the raw silk sells at 1pp+ per Ac <br/>
&gt; pt.  Boots are<br/>
&gt; the biggest sellers for me.  No one seems to want a raw silk <br/>
&gt; tunic, but the<br/>
&gt; Cured Silk tunic is so popular (due to giving that buff <br/>
&gt; guildmaster look) I<br/>
&gt; have been selling them for 25pp with no complaints or <br/>
&gt; question.  The Cured<br/>
&gt; pants are also very popular because the AC to wt ratio for <br/>
&gt; them is ungodly<br/>
&gt; good compared to even mesh.  Pants normally have the worst <br/>
&gt; AC/wt ratio of<br/>
&gt; any piece in an armor set so these are an amazing upgrade <br/>
&gt; even over mesh.<br/>

&gt; that stops<br/>
&gt; me!)<br/>
