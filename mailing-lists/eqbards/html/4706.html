<b>Subject:</b> Missed notes <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056271498">Has everyone else noticed that missed notes when starting a<br/>
song is now annoying frequent?  Not just with new songs<br/>
either, I&#39;m missing notes with low level songs like<br/>
Accelerando and Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I liked about EQ combat was (other than<br/>
weaving songs) the lack of a twitch factor.  If notes continue<br/>
to be missed at this rate, coupled with all the resists which<br/>
force you to retry the song (thus inviting more missed notes),<br/>
I may just give up.  If I wanted to play an arcade game, I<br/>
would&#39;ve bought a Playstation.<br/>
