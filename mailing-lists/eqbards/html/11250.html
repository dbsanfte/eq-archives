<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126331453">THe reason I started a bard (as a secondary char) was because of how<br/>
much the bard I regularly group with helps our party...  Not to<br/>
mentioned it looked fun to do all the stuff he was doing...  Seriously<br/>
even at relativly low levels, the enhancments he made to our group<br/>
(which is a bit fighter heavy) are amazing.  We almost double our<br/>
killing rate when he is around (he has a weak connection, so I really<br/>
get to see the with bard and without bard power of our group).<br/>
<br/>
Between his pulling  (no SOW in the group), crowd control (no enchater<br/>
either), fighting enhancment and healing enhancment, our downtime is a<br/>
fraction of its former self when he&#39;s there.  I especially appreciate<br/>
him as I&#39;m the cleric of our group, and its such a relief not having to<br/>
waste mana at the start of a fight to heal the puller then go work a<br/>
little crowd control...  I actually get to stand up and smash the<br/>
monsters for a little bit! (well if you count miss, miss, hit for 2,<br/>
miss, hit for 1, miss as smashing)<br/>
<br/>
Bards are a pretty cool class, I wouldn&#39;t say they are the most<br/>
powerful, but being able to do all that we (I got my first 5 levels this<br/>
weekend so I&#39;m offically a bard now, thank my hockey team for missing<br/>
the playoffs) can is a lot of fun.  Other than some pointless (most<br/>
casters have that wasted ID spell too), broken? songs I think Vernat did<br/>
a pretty good job with bards (I have plenty of Verant complaints, but<br/>
they&#39;re game has moved up to my #3 all time in terms of total play time,<br/>
Diablo and Civilization are starting to sweat).  We seem to adequatly<br/>
fill in for almost any role in the party if the &quot;master&quot; of that role<br/>
isn&#39;t there.  I kind of thought that was our role.  Now if only we got a<br/>
bind song...<br/>
