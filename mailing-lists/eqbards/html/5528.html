&gt; *ACTUALLY* hehe - what you&#39;ve experienced is something *entirely*<br/>
&gt; different, I don&#39;t believe they&#39;re related - it&#39;s just a lag-bubble popping<br/>
&gt; on you.  If you ever see a message like &quot;You swing at &lt;playername&gt; and<br/>
&gt; miss! &lt;Playername&gt; died!&quot; send a tell to that player - they died exactly<br/>
&gt; when you were zoning in and somehow the server got confused about who was<br/>
&gt; doing what...  Happens to me all the time, (at least once a night) so I<br/>
&gt; really believe it to be lag-related.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The other way around is true too. I once had this message after zoning in Solusek<br/>
A.<br/>
<br/>
You strike a Orc for XX of damage.<br/>
You have slain an Orc !<br/>
<br/>
Wow. I can strike now !<br/>

The pollution is getting to be so bad that magicians are complaining that there&#39;s<br/>
no more thin air to make people disappear into.</div>
