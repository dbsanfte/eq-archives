Use songs 1 and 7 until you hit level 10.  Then you can switch out Anthem de<br/>
Arms , while keeping up healing, and mabye the MR song at level 9 (if<br/>
needed) or the wince song.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you&#39;re about to hit level 8, which is a great song.  Singing the level<br/>
8 song will make the orcs/dervs sad, so that you can pull them one at a<br/>
time.  Remember to sing it to each orc/derv, or the others will follow.<br/>

&gt; Heya guys...<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if you could tell me some very basic strategies on<br/>
&gt; using our songs in groups and solo.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am about to hit level 8 so I dont have a lot of them, however what I do<br/>
&gt; is start off by singing the str/dex song you get at lev1, then once its<br/>
&gt; started<br/>
&gt; I start up my regeneration song, then I start whistling the ancient<br/>
&gt; warsong<br/>
&gt; (lev 7)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; then I keep rotating between em to keep them going, and so far it seems to<br/>
&gt; work<br/>
&gt; nicely for me.  I will occasionally add in the lev 2 song that makes the<br/>
&gt; enemy &quot;wince&quot;<br/>
&gt; but its kind of dangerous and Im never sure if its helping much anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What are some tips I can look forward to using at future levels?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, well...I was gonna ask about some weapons...but Ill put it in<br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; mail to keep this thread pure.<br/>
