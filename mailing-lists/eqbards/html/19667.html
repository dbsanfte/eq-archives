<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] How did you play when you were 15th? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-468952171">Hi guys, I&#39;m new to this list and I was hoping I could get a little advice<br/>
on play tactics. I have a 15th level bard as my secondary character and he&#39;s<br/>
an awesome change from my ranger and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to play<br/>
him most effectivly. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting orcs in Crushbone by meleeing<br/>
them and bellowing at them, it seemed to be working better than bringing up<br/>
Anthem for it&#39;s haste factor. I tried using the 15th level song to mez them<br/>
but it didn&#39;t seem to buy me anything in combat, it did help me escape a<br/>
training one afternoon though. Is there another way I should be playing the<br/>
encounters? Is there any place you&#39;d recomend that would be hungry for a<br/>
bard to group at my level?<br/>
