I cruise through the zone.  Unfortunately, he still kicks my ass.  He<br/>
appears to resist chain and fear so much, it&#39;s scary.  Hopefully, one of<br/>
these days he&#39;ll die at my hands (I think I can take him with fear + chain<br/>
now, but he has a nasty tendency of running through buildings)<br/>

A little off topic : Do you know how many level 50s there are going to be<br/>
when the alleged expansion comes?  The overcrowding is going to be so out of<br/>
control.  Even now, there appears to be more people above level 30 than<br/>
below level 10 at any given time.  There is something not right about this,<br/>
but that&#39;s what happens when you have &quot;capped&quot; levels.<br/>
