<div id="ygrps-yiv-94053351">Yeah, when we had a chanter and shaman, I would frequently use SOS/Cantata/SOS. Can&#39;t BOH with SOS<br/>
so it was just the three. I remember the joy of 55 since I no longer had to switch out instruments<br/>
for Cantata. <br/>
<br/>
If I come back to EQ for more than quest appearances, I want the epic just to stop switching out<br/>
instuments and weapons. Key mashing is easy compared to targeting, running, etc. with weapons and<br/>
instruments on your pointer all the time.<br/>

Good points. Also in a group situation, if the group is in any way<br/>
balanced, I often have a hard time twisting three songs that the party<br/>
actaully NEEDS. Sure, I can resort to dots, but at 58 playing with good to<br/>
excellently equipped characters, we really don&#39;t need the extra damage.<br/>
<br/>
But then again, maybe I am just a lazy bard, rather than one who &quot;knows my<br/>
role.&quot;<br/>
