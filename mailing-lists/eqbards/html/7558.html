<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260725703"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Real life isn&#39;t level-based.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Working in a corporation, I would have to disagree with you.<br/>
And I&#39;d say real life has it&#39;s levels too..  :) Examples:<br/>
<br/>
Level 15 - Apprentice Driver&#39;s License<br/>
Level 16 - Driver&#39;s License<br/>
Level 18 - Adult License<br/>
Level 21 - Drinking License<br/>
Level 65 - Retirement License<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here has been stimulating, it&#39;s all pointless if Verant never<br/>
&gt; sees it.  There&#39;s not much to gain arguing it with us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That pretty much says that most of the things argued or <br/>
discussed on this list are pointless. If nothing else,<br/>
it makes us all feel better to be able to vent and know<br/>
that other people feel the same way and agree, or even<br/>
have other people such as yourself, with intelligent<br/>
comments on the other side of the view. Sometimes, I<br/>
even find such comments change my mind and make me see<br/>
things I disliked in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
However, this hasn&#39;t happened on the bind issue.</div>
