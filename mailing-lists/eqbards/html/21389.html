<div id="ygrps-yiv-144541715">Do you guys honestly think there is some kind of Verant plan to screw over<br/>
bards?<br/>
<br/>
Come back to reality.  Verant is a poorly run company.  Their in house<br/>
testing is abysmal (if it exists at all, which I have serious doubts of).<br/>
Their customer service is embarassing, and their arrogance is the stuff of<br/>
kings.  They just wrote a really good game.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, they treat everyone like that.  Perhaps theres a few more<br/>
bard problems since we are the most unusual class in the game.  (This goes<br/>
back to their lack of testing.)<br/>
<br/>
Why did you expect things to change this time?<br/>
<br/>
Until a viable competitor arrives, this attitude won&#39;t hurt them.  If<br/>
Anarchy Online (which I doubt will be, as its a sci fi setting, which has<br/>
always been a smaller market than fantasy.) is this viable competitor then<br/>
soon we will see them reaping what they have sown.  If not we will have to<br/>
wait for horizons/shadowbane/whatever.  (All of which are a long way away).<br/>
<br/>
Recent posts from Brad indicate to me, they believe the game has reached its<br/>
peak and are preparing for the inevitable shrinking of the population.</div>
