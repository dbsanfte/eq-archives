level. Also, however, as you don&#39;t seem to have done this yet,<br/>
Blackburrow is a great place to start meeting people to start grouping<br/>
with. There will be lots of warrior types resting up on either side of<br/>
the zone line. Offer to group with them temporarily to help them heal.<br/>
This is a quick way to make lots of friends there, some of whom might<br/>
decide later that they&#39;d like a bard along just for the heal song.<br/>
<br/>
To up and coming bards, try doing this even earlier, like L6 as so as<br/>
you get your heal song. The bard is a grouping character so, IMO, it&#39;s<br/>
really important you both learn to play in groups as early as possible<br/>
and start building up a circle of friends who appreciate what a bard can<br/>
do as early as you can. It pays off in the long run, believe me.<br/>
