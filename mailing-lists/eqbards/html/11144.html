<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Strength is a question a good many bards will disagree with me on - many<br/>
&gt;like to play tank, so to them, str is very important for carrying heavy<br/>
&gt;armor and damage.<br/>
&gt;As far as being a bard - bard - str isn&#39;t that important to our song<br/>
&gt;capability.<br/>
&gt;Take a look at the bonuses on Lambent - str is not nearly one of the most<br/>
&gt;important staff Verant gave us - not that I&#39;d automatically assume anyone<br/>
&gt;there REALLY knows what a bard needs, hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. Str is of primary importance at lvls 6-15 maybe, but after it<br/>
diminishes rapidly in favor of other area like agility, dexterity, and<br/>
charisma.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our hand to hand caps pretty low anyway, so don&#39;t ever think you&#39;re gonna<br/>
&gt;do much more than scratch a mob with it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true, another sore point with many bards.  Doing a bit of everything<br/>
and nothing well can mean having a very difficult time as you go on in less<br/>
than a full group (or close).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Here is one tip tho - you can tank in a pinch, but after awhile - you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;soon come to realize bards are NOT tanks, no matter how much some may wish<br/>
&gt;they were.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A truer point probably could not be made.  Especially considering Verant is<br/>
among those who think we are a tank by virtue of being a hybrid.  Verant&#39;s<br/>
concept of a hybrid was initially &quot;A primarily melee class with some spell<br/>
abilities like Paladins, Rangers, Shadowknights, and Bards&quot; according to an<br/>
old press piece.<br/>
