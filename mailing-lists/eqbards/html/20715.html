<br/>
&gt; My shaman, Fenryr always &quot;throws a small sack of bones<br/>
&gt; on the ground and studies them carefully&quot; when asked<br/>
&gt; for a SOW.  The spirits may require a gift for his<br/>
&gt; magic to work -- it might be a bone chip, it might be<br/>
&gt; a bottle of kalish and it might be free...but the<br/>
&gt; price is the price and the spirits can&#39;t be denied;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love this and plan to steal the idea for my own shaman!<br/>
<br/>
My rogue denies being a rogue.  This will be easier as I get more changes of<br/>
armor/weapons, but for now she usually claims to be a ranger who hasn&#39;t had<br/>
funding enough to purchase spells.<br/>
<br/>
My bard is an entertainer and world observer.  It&#39;s not uncommon to see her<br/>
chatting about forests with dark elves or jumping up and and landing in a<br/>
split while playing her lute with her teeth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All my characters have a thing about beggars.  I think<br/>
&gt; begging takes away from the game.  Terrok and Fenryr<br/>
&gt; never give anything away, Tyunes likes to surprise<br/>
&gt; young bards with hand-me-down items.  Ask and you<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t get. Offer to buy or just be polite and Tyunes<br/>
&gt; will normally help out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same here.  I given beggars foraged grubs and offered to teach them how to<br/>
fish though.<br/>
