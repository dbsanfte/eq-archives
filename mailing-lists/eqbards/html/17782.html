<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407180674">This was my second petition.  First was at 6th lvl<br/>
when  Orc Centurians were spawning atop the Orc lift<br/>
in Klelthin.  We retreated from Orc Hill because the<br/>
volume was too much for us.  Kept getting faction<br/>
messages even tho we weren&#39;t fighting any more....got<br/>
to the bottom of the lift and rested.  Kept getting<br/>
faction messages.<br/>
<br/>
The guards at Kelethin are a bit dense...we were<br/>
attacked again and again.  We moved to the top of the<br/>
lift....kept on getting faction messages.<br/>
<br/>
Resting at the top of the lift, faction messages<br/>
continued.  Cents were spawning among us and<br/>
attacking.<br/>
<br/>
My petition was answered by GM Traikis who told me: <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s fairly common for orcs to spawn above the lift.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was not impressed.  <br/>
<br/>
The faction messages continued until we all died and<br/>
then the orcs stopped spawning around us<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;That&#39;s what I thought too, but apparently the<br/>
&gt; teleport spot for <br/>
&gt; &gt;Butcherblock<br/>
&gt; &gt;is at about 10,000 ft.  You immediately fall and<br/>
&gt; take 10,000 points anyhow<br/>
&gt; &gt;which is as you can guess instantly fatal.  Not<br/>
&gt; good when you are bound in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Halas at the time as I was.  The GM&#39;s never<br/>
&gt; responded to my petition even<br/>
&gt; &gt;though I was beneath the world and was supposedly<br/>
&gt; teleported to a &quot;safe<br/>
&gt; &gt;spot&quot;<br/>
