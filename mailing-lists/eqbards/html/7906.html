<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519004193">Excellent!  This is good news indeed.  As far as &quot;bard&quot; quests go, we&#39;re<br/>
really getting screwed.  In fact, I was under the impression that there<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be any bard quests at the new temple.  This snippet has brightened<br/>
by day for sure.  However, if they are anything like the few quests we<br/>
already have, they probably won&#39;t be worth doing (IMO).<br/>

Someone asked earlier if there were any bard quests currently in the<br/>
Temple of Solusek Ro. Well due to level 50 boredom, I make a newbie dark<br/>
elf on the test server and went to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
There are indeed 2 bard NPCs there, but they were in fact the only 2<br/>
NPCs in there who wouldnt talk to me. They con&#39;d apprehensive, while<br/>
everything else was indifferent no matter what race/class it was.<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve only seen NPCs for misc stuff (resetting your specialization<br/>
skills), Necros, Wizards, Mages, Clerics, and Bards. So guess we lucked<br/>
out so far unless they&#39;re still adding other quest NPCs for other<br/>
classes.<br/>
