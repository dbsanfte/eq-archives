<b>Subject:</b> Re: MM Castle Tour was: Gypsy Lute <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758228408">Hehe, our guild was looking for something that &#39;everyone&#39; could do (i.e.:<br/>
get the Planar folks in groups with our mids and even our 20&#39;s) so we<br/>
decided to pay MM a visit on Sunday afternoon.  We had 4 or 5 groups, bunch<br/>
of level 50&#39;s wiz, clr, rangers, sks, shams, and then anyone and everyone<br/>
else.  Some got excited and went in early and started clearing the tunnel,<br/>
grave yard and such.  When I got there, they were clearing the pit.  There<br/>
was no battle plan beyond kill it if it moves.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty soon they were clearing the ramp to the castle front door and them<br/>
inside the castle.  Lev 50 SK&#39;s and rangers would dash up and snag stuff and<br/>
pull whatever come to the bottom of the ramp.  At that point the trains were<br/>
derailed. Well, kinda hard to call them trains cause they were merely 6 or 8<br/>
mobs at a time running smack dab into 20 or 30 of us.  Hehe, our Lev 50<br/>
wizards had fun times dropping their little used AE spells all over<br/>
everything.  Black silk gloves, gypsy lutes, MM granite, cook pots, what<br/>
have you - all littered the grounds.<br/>
<br/>
After about an hour maybe not quite, the path and most of the castle was<br/>
cleared.  Groups started moving in and camping rooms. Pretty soon, there was<br/>
a shortage of stuff to pull.  Well, kind of a shortage.  One SK goes &quot;can I<br/>
pull the rest of the castle here?&quot; (We were in the main foyer/ballroom?)<br/>
Hehe, since nobody screamed &quot;OMG NO!!!!&quot;  He did.  We had a castle pull -<br/>
classic MM style.  There were by later count 17 mobs pulled into the melee.<br/>
When the MM granite dust settled, there were only like 3 deaths on our<br/>
side - one was a Lev 50 wiz who no doubt attracted alot of AE attention,<br/>
another was a mid-30ish druid who was tagging along when he saw us clear the<br/>
castle and I forget who the 3rd one was - but amazingly enough I lived<br/>
through the whole event.<br/>
<br/>
We got to move around and explore rooms with relative impunity.   Yes, we&#39;d<br/>
see room spawns but the local residents were simply over powered when ever<br/>
they tried to appear.  And we did get a couple appearances:  some troll guy<br/>
named Ixytcol (sp?) and some Princess.  Hehe, they did not last very long.<br/>
We, respected the local campers (butler/maid & diamondine guys) but pretty<br/>
much emptied the first and second floors of the castle (we - or at least my<br/>
group - did not explore the jail and tower - i still want to see that part<br/>
too).  And about every 3rd kill was xp for me - hehe.<br/>
<br/>
The whole event ran just over 2 hours and was great fun to come into to a<br/>
very scary zone and simply over power it.  A while back someone posted here<br/>
about trying this with &#39;pick-up groups&#39; or a server event.  Maybe it could<br/>
be done.  But doing it as a guild gives you many advantages.  First off, you<br/>
trust everyone and know you have the right classes to handle things - hehe<br/>
level 50 clerics make the world of difference in your confidence.  And for<br/>
us, it was a great &quot;fun&quot; event for everyone to be involved with.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the scenery there is some of the very best in the game.  It is by<br/>
far one of my most favorite zones.<br/>

&gt; MM castle is simply stunning - too bad it&#39;s so deadly few ever get to<br/>
&gt; appreciate it. </span></blockquote></div>
