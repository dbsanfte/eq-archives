<div id="ygrps-yiv-633762940">That&#39;s not my experience in Sebelis.  I have several Minos in the bank (from<br/>
my Lguk days) and have 126 Cha Unbuffed.  I get resists to Pixie a good 50<br/>
percent of the time on High Blue Yellows in Sebelis<br/>

I have very little trouble keeping 2 mobs mezzed with pixie strike. Using a<br/>
mino horn (Save up for one of these babies!!!!) and with 135 unbuffed cha<br/>
(nothing special) I was keeping 2 mobs mezzed in chardok (where the mobs are<br/>
high blue/yellow to me, if a mob was red to me, we were probably killing it<br/>
first).<br/>
<br/>
So Pixie is reliable enough to keep 2 mobs mezzed.<br/>
