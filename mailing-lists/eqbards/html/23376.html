<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063652892">That is not correct.  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; - if you mean<br/>
&quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments have partials.<br/>
Regardless, the determination of instrument types is by how the sound itself<br/>
is generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips vibration creates<br/>
the sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child - a big day<br/>
for me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>
Shofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>
<br/>
On a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>
instrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the exception of the<br/>
flute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations caused by the<br/>
wind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>
<br/>
	A saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind instrument.<br/>
<br/>
As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a brass player - we<br/>
are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies the sound.<br/>
This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search of a good<br/>
reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get one or two in a<br/>
box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>

Actually it is more correct for it to be a wind instrument.  Brass<br/>
instruments all have stops, wind instruments do not necessarily have them.<br/>
