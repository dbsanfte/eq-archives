<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-197344888">On the subject of Mistmoore.. there&#39;s the crypt area,<br/>
or at least that&#39;s what I call it. There&#39;s holes in<br/>
the floor on either side of the casket that drop you<br/>
into an area below. Can anyone tell me how to get OUT<br/>
of that area? The only door that I saw that opens, <br/>
opens up 3 other doors with creatures that don&#39;t<br/>
exactly like visitors stopping by for brunch.</div>
