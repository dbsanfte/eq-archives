&gt; SV for disease and poison.  i never found these very useful, and also<br/>
&gt; found it strange that two songs, both high level, would have this<br/>
&gt; effect.  does anyone have any actual experience using them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; also, level 35 denon&#39;s dissension, i have bought and used, though i<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really know what effect it is having on the targets.  i guess it<br/>
&gt; could just be an exact upgrade of level 18 denon&#39;s disruptive discord,<br/>
&gt; but if anyone knows it&#39;s true effects i&#39;d love to know if it does<br/>
&gt; anything different.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe Denon&#39;s Dissension is supposed to drain the enemies mana, kind<br/>
of the opposite of level 32 song.  How about level 36 song, i heard its<br/>
quite a good one when combined with anthem de arms.<br/>
