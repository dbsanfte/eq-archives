<div id="ygrps-yiv-339006535">Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
As many of you may know, JackalX, the well-loved bard from Tunare, is <br/>
retiring.  He&#39;s been one of the longest-lived 50th level bards, and a <br/>
constant contributor to the bardic community.  As a show of fellowship, and <br/>
to see that he leaves with a bang, not a whimper, we, the Bards of Norrath, <br/>
are staging an event in honor of his retirement: Jackalstock.<br/>
<br/>
The premise is simple.  Anyone who wishes to come is welcome, be they bard <br/>
or other well-wisher.  We&#39;ll all make newbie halflings and meet at the <br/>
Priest of Discord in Rivervale on Tunare at 12noon PST on Saturday, February <br/>
12th, 2000.  From there, we&#39;ll proceed to High Hold Pass, where we&#39;ll be <br/>
bound.  Once everyone is gathered, mandolins will be distributed (so we&#39;ll <br/>
be happy halfling bards) and we will proceed to East Karana.  We&#39;ll all <br/>
gather at the top of the gorge, and leap lemminglike into the great beyond.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to attend, please create a character with a name beginning Jx, <br/>
followed by the name of your bard or other main character.  Thus Aloro <br/>
becomes Jxaloro, Demari becomes Jxdemari, etc.  This aids in identifying <br/>
each other.  Please do not turn /roleplay or /anon on, so we can tell who&#39;s <br/>
attending and find when everyone&#39;s in place.  Further, please don&#39;t PvP so <br/>
we can bind you.  Please be at the Priest of Discord in Rivervale on the <br/>
Tunare server at noon PST on Saturday the 12th, ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who remember Gnomestock &#39;99, this is a similar event <br/>
designed to offer the Bards from different servers a chance to socialize and <br/>
have some silly fun, while offering up our lives in JackalX&#39;s memory.  This <br/>
is more a wake than a funeral, so expect booze and merriment.  Once we&#39;ve <br/>
leapt (as many times as we feel appropriate) we&#39;ll gather at the Tiger&#39;s <br/>
Roar, one of the finest taverns in Norrath, for frolicking and carousing.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
Aloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>
