&gt; All we have is theories based on observation - and who knows how much the<br/>
&gt; dreaded random number generator affects this?  Perhaps it&#39;s the playing of<br/>
&gt; songs.  Other theories - high charisma.  Low Hit points...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	It might be either of those two, but it doesn&#39;t seem to effect<br/>
enchanters standing by watching a fight, and they have both higher charisma<br/>
and lower hit points than bards (in most cases)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would guess that at times Class is a factor.  I&#39;ve seen messages from<br/>
&gt; Mobs<br/>
&gt; lately - I forget the exact wording - but to the affect that &quot;I hate bards<br/>
&gt; like you...&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	The mobs that say this, say it about all classes.  If you&#39;re a monk,<br/>
they&#39;ll say &quot;I hate monks like you...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So in this case - I would say bard hate does exist.<br/>
&gt;  Otherwise - your guess is as good as mine!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I&#39;d personally have to say it does exist.  Only recently have I not<br/>
been the center of a single mobs attack. ( if there are multi-mobs, they<br/>
come after either me,the cleric, or the enchanter).  I&#39;m level 24 and now<br/>
most of the melee types are doing far more damage than me, and so the mobs<br/>
leaves me alone, or the casters do far more damage than me, and they leave<br/>
me alone.  Pre-level 20, I was doing somewhat less damage than pallies,<br/>
monks, warriors, yet the mobs would stick to me like glue. Of course part of<br/>
this is as a bard, I was usually relegated to pulling duty also, so I was<br/>
tops on their hate list before battle started, but it would often happen<br/>
regardless of whether I pulled or not.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been hearing rumors that &quot;bard hate&quot; does not really exist...<br/>
&gt; Anyone actually have proof that it does?<br/>
