<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982706291">Well, mostly hypothetical, but I&#39;ve seen on a few bardic websites that harps<br/>
were mentioned as possible instruments, but can&#39;t remember where....tho that<br/>
may have been used as an example also *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Will keep looking for some info :)<br/>

btw, where is a good place to hunt for this level?  I&#39;ll go pretty much<br/>
anywhere (in Steamfont now, soloing stuff outside the mino caves, but<br/>
grouping within)<br/>

&gt; Unfortunately, as far as I know, there are no &quot;advanced&quot; instruments<br/>
&gt; currently in the game.  If there were, you can rest assured that tidbit of<br/>
&gt; info would get posted to this list.  The bard petition that was submitted<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; few weeks back requested that Verant add magical instruments but so far<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; battle drum is the only one in the game.  I have never heard of a harp<br/>
&gt; existing in the game but I haven&#39;t been in the bards guild since the last<br/>
&gt; patch so don&#39;t know if it has been added or not.  Have you seen a harp in<br/>
&gt; game or were you using it as a hypothetical example?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was under the impression that the more &quot;advanced&quot; instruments (i.e.<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; &gt; expensive ones or ones found on monsters) would have a higher multiplier<br/>
&gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs.  Like a harp found on a creature would mean that healing went up<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher than using a mandolin.<br/>
