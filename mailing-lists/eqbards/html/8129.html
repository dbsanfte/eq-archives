<div id="ygrps-yiv-693364254"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; While running through SK, I heard the rumble of elephants walking<br/>
&gt; as well as their distinct bellow (really cool sounding with a SBLive).  I<br/>
&gt; also started hearing my own footsteps.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SBLive! has a few problems with the environmental sounds.  Everyone I know<br/>
that did the upgrade to LiveWare 2.1 lost them, I assume because EQ doesn&#39;t<br/>
support EAX 2.0.<br/>
<br/>
To get mine to come back, I had to turn down the hardware acceleration slider,<br/>
carefully hidden at Start Menu-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;MultiMedia-&gt;Audio-&gt;<br/>
Playback-&gt;Advanced Properties-&gt;Performance-&gt;Hardware Acceleration.  Notch<br/>
it down to 75%.  Only thing that worked for me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to tug the thread back to Bard-dom.  It took me a while after the<br/>
update to notice I&#39;d lost the sounds, and a bit of pawing around on the<br/>
EQ and Creative sites to find a solution.  As soon as I did, it saved my<br/>
life...  Moments after loggin in, I &quot;heard&quot; the stomping of an unseen Hill<br/>
Giant while looting a corpse.  He got a few swings in on me but not before<br/>
I had the drum armed.  I did the &quot;dead man speed walk&quot; back to the zone line,<br/>
giant in tow.  Boy they run fast.<br/>
<br/>
Bards get my vote for &quot;most survivable character class&quot;.  I don&#39;t mind most<br/>
of the other drawbacks as long as I can always run like heck, or charm, or<br/>
lull...  If I had a dollar for every time I got below a bubble then wove<br/>
Accelerando and Hymn with the Lute, only to make a final stand at the zone<br/>
line and finsih off the unruly beast(s) that would have killed a hapless<br/>
Warrior or Wizard...<br/>
