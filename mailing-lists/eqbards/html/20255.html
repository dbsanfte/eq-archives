<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-780654263">Go MoviesGreetings everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would drop a note.... I got my singing steel arms last night. I couldnt believe it. It was a guild raide and we had 3 bards originally ( the only 3 in the guild)  but one had to leave. Down to two. Everyone was getting tired , people started talking about leaving.. So the leader said one more spawn..  OK.. he pulls a named and poof theres the arms...  Now I had just gotten a Sebilite Bracer ( 9 ac 4str 4cha only +3 more cha than lambent bracer and looks like chain) mainly cause noone wanted it. So they let me random with the other bard and I rolled a 60 ,, ugh... he rolled a 30 something and was crying all over the floor :).<br/>
<br/>
Im so happy I had to post it... more info below<br/>
