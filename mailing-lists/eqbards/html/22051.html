<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219491788">Thanks all for the help.  I do have a SB card now, so I&#39;ll check that the<br/>
drivers are latest & greatest.  If they are I&#39;ll try knocking back the<br/>
acceleration.  I&#39;ve already upgraded to DirectX 7.0 though, so that&#39;s out.<br/>

Make sure that you have the latest version of DirectX - 7.0 seems to work<br/>
fine.<br/>
The strange sound effects seem to be something related to Soundblasters -<br/>
mine does that all the time, and I heard about it a lot while Guiding.  You<br/>
might also check to make sure that you have the latest drivers from<br/>
Creative Labs.<br/>
<br/>
As to leaving, well, I have to stand up for my beliefs.  I find it rather<br/>
ironic that one of the last statements I made to my former server GM was<br/>
&quot;For the love of god, hire a real PR man.  Abashi is the worst thing to<br/>
happen to Verant because of his unswerving attitudes.  You have to be<br/>
willing to admit you make mistakes, or the public will instinctively<br/>
mistrust you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heh - I guess it worked ;)<br/>
