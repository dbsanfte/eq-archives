<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626139745">Currently there are only about 4 level 50 bards on my server, 2 of which are<br/>
active (and really cool) and there are maybe 5 or 6 more between 35 and 50<br/>
(I know all but one of them and they also are very friendly and cool).  I&#39;m<br/>
still hoping to be one of the first 10 bards to reach 50 there on Prexus<br/>
:-).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Pray that the fallout from your raid is nothing like the one on Prexus.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; &gt; good feelings from the raids (Vox, Nagefen and Fear all went down in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; period of 3 days) quickly turned into animosity, arguments, cries of<br/>
&gt; &gt; elitism, and just plain bad mojo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It already has begun, sir.  People are crying about how they didnt<br/>
&gt;   get invited, and all sorts of crap.  Hell, even someone sh*thead<br/>
&gt;   from FoH posted saying Innoruuk server is a bunch of lame f*cks<br/>
&gt;   if they think beating Cazic means anything big.  FoH is just a bunch<br/>
&gt;   of lame pricks anyway.  Every server has this &#39;lame prick elite&#39;<br/>
&gt;   guild, you just need to avoid them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m really really hoping the landscape changes by the time I get to<br/>
45+...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s only gonna get worse.  Granted, I&#39;m new to the L50 scene... but<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m one of few L50 bards, so in a way I&#39;m kinda a new L50 in the bard<br/>
&gt;   area, which is lacking on Innoruuk.  So many L50s out there flooding<br/>
&gt;   up things.  Dragons wont live more than 24 hours these days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harm.<br/>
