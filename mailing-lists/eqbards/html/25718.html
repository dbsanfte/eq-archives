<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115057068">There are walkthroughs found readily enough on the usual spoiler sights.  I<br/>
had no problems with any of these except the Kaesoria.  It&#39;s ultra random<br/>
spawn - so some people get it in 10 minutes - others camp for hours to get<br/>
one...<br/>

Since I got a Walrus Skin - the Tambo is my backup in the bank for corpse<br/>
runs.<br/>

Had a guild party camping the one in Kaesora for about five to six hours.<br/>
The mob that drops it only spawned twice and never had the coin.  We were<br/>
the only people in Kaesora at the time so at least there were enough mobs<br/>
to keep us happy.  Have had the other five coins in the bank for probably a<br/>
year now.</div>
