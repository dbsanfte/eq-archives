<div id="ygrps-yiv-688708323">Taken from that perspective (which I didn&#39;t) then I would agree that the<br/>
price would skyrocket.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I almost made this same point, but then realized that the seller&#39;s almost<br/>
&gt; hidden implication was that the Ykeshas that had dropped prior to the<br/>
&gt; patch<br/>
&gt; would remain equippable by classes other than WAR (highly likely) and that<br/>
&gt; *those* ykesha&#39;s prices would shoot through the roof.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s still wrong though.  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d tell this guy he needs to retake his ECON 101 class so he fully<br/>
&gt; &gt; understood the laws of supply/demand.  If Verant were to change the<br/>
&gt; Ykesha<br/>
&gt; &gt; to where only warriors could equip it (and they publicly said<br/>
&gt; &gt; they weren&#39;t),<br/>
&gt; &gt; then the demand would drop drastically.  Only a stupid warrior<br/>
&gt; &gt; would pay 10K<br/>
&gt; &gt; for them at that point.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth<br/>
&gt; &gt; of loot but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the price<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
