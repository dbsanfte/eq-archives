<div id="ygrps-yiv-510027205">There are certainly good piercing weapons at all levels of the game, so<br/>
don&#39;t feel like you have hamstrung your character for RP sake.  That being<br/>
said, there are some awfully good one hand slash and one hand blunt weapons<br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I use a staff of writhing (love that proc) and silvery war axe,<br/>
but a mere two levels ago, I was a pierce-meister, with an ashenwood short<br/>
spear in one hand and a dragoon dirk in the other.<br/>
<br/>
I think bards should try to be masters of all three skills, since you never<br/>
know when a good ashenwood spear, staff of writhing or crystalline sword is<br/>
going to come your way, but if you&#39;re happy just poking people, more power<br/>
to you.<br/>
