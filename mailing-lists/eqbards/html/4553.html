<div id="ygrps-yiv-531760295"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I know the guy that talks (or used to in beta) about a <br/>
&gt; titanic bridge.  He is in South Qeynos, he is located<br/>
&gt; in a wood house directly to the right of the clock<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s still there, and if you hail him he talks about the titanic bridge. But<br/>
there&#39;s no keywords [] in what he says so I have no idea what to say next..<br/>
I suppose I could just give him the map (they&#39;re fairly easy to get) and see<br/>
what happens.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Good luck, and tell me if you get <br/>
&gt; something to work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone also told me that the map is supposed to go to a guard (in Qeynos I<br/>
believe) so I just don&#39;t know where this one is supposed to go. (Thus the<br/>
reason I asked hehe)<br/>
<br/>
PS: Have any of you been in the Plaguebringers area of the Qeynos Aqueducts?<br/>
It is *so* neat looking. (But not as cool as Neriak is) Suggestion - start a<br/>
human necro and go looking. Don&#39;t take your Bard down there.</div>
