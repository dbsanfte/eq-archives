<b>Subject:</b> News on stats from Abashi via EQCaster&#39;s <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-478359240">This topic has been heatly discussed on the alt.games.everquest newsgroup<br/>
recently.  A lot of people, especially the shamans, are really disgusted if<br/>
everything Abashi stated was true.  To sum up what he said in very general<br/>
terms, DEX and AGI have no impact whatsoever on combat skills like dodge,<br/>
block, riposte, and parry.  DEX has no impact on improving your chance to<br/>
get a successful hit.  There was more to his post but DEX and AGI I think<br/>
are the two stats everyone was primarily complaining about.  One person even<br/>
posted that for the melee classes, since stats are almost meaningless, EQ is<br/>
more a first person shooter than a RPG.  <br/>
<br/>
If its true that primary stats don&#39;t really affect combat skills that much,<br/>
I wonder how important resist rates are?  I would really hate to find out<br/>
that they aren&#39;t important in successfully making a resistance roll as we<br/>
think they are.  Black helicopter sighting here:  the other night I was in<br/>
Mistmoore and my party decided to pull a negotiator that was wandering.  I<br/>
equipped drum and weaved both elemental and guardian rhythms.  That raised<br/>
my magic resist rate to well over 100.  Myself and three other people in my<br/>
party still got charmed by the negotiator.  I had told everyone beforehand<br/>
that I would have both songs up for the entire fight so none of us were<br/>
likely to get charmed.  To say the least I wasn&#39;t the most popular person in<br/>
the group after that.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; According to Abashi and reported by EQCasters, stats affect your chances<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; raising your skill level in skills.  Agility increases the chance of<br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt; a skill raise in dodge is a listed example.  This would seem to greatly<br/>
&gt; downplay the value of stats once you hit your skill cap in many areas<br/>
&gt; sadly.<br/>
