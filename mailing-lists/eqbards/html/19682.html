<div id="ygrps-yiv-519523641">I&#39;ve been reading posts about what an awesome combonation it is pairing a<br/>
bard and a rogue (written by both bards and rogues)  I haven&#39;t heard so much<br/>
from other classes about great success they have with rogues.  It may be<br/>
that other combonations don&#39;t work as well, so their opinions of Verants<br/>
Weakest Class haven&#39;t changed.<br/>
<br/>
My low-level rogue generally gets refused for groups because those involved<br/>
are sure there must be SOMEONE out their in the right level range that would<br/>
be better for the group than me.  That and the unspoken accusation that I&#39;ll<br/>
steal their loot.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will never understand why anyone would refuse to add a <br/>
&gt; rogue to a group.<br/>
&gt; The only legitimate reason I can think of is if they aleady <br/>
&gt; have enough<br/>
&gt; tanks and need a healer or a nuker to balance out the group.  <br/>
&gt; I have have<br/>
&gt; tremendous success the past few weeks grouping with rogues in <br/>
&gt; Kunark.  With<br/>
&gt; just me and a rogue we can chain/fear or instill <br/>
&gt; doubt/backstab mobs left<br/>
&gt; and right.  Most recent example was in the Overthere zone.  <br/>
&gt; There was a<br/>
&gt; party of four pulling to the FM zone.  I was already grouped <br/>
&gt; with a rogue<br/>
&gt; and we asked to join the party.  They were willing to add me <br/>
&gt; but not the<br/>
&gt; rogue.  I told them either both of us or none of us.  They <br/>
&gt; decided against<br/>
&gt; adding us both.  We showed them up by using <br/>
&gt; chains/fear/backstab right there<br/>
&gt; next to them.  We pulled and killed just as many mobs as they <br/>
&gt; did.  Since we<br/>
&gt; had little downtime, theres a good chance we killed more mobs <br/>
&gt; than they did.<br/>
&gt; And since there was just two of us, I think its safe to say <br/>
&gt; we ended up<br/>
&gt; getting more EXP than they did.  Anytime a group I&#39;m in <br/>
&gt; refuses to add a<br/>
&gt; rogue, I&#39;ll drop from the group and join him myself.  <br/>

&gt; Would you really rather have not had an entire evening of <br/>
&gt; awesome grouping<br/>
&gt; so that you wouldn&#39;t lose a little experience?  Treasure your <br/>
&gt; lower levels<br/>
&gt; while you still can.  As my level 48 rogue, I often just sit <br/>
&gt; waiting for a<br/>
&gt; group for hours on end (not kidding here, longest I&#39;ve ever <br/>
&gt; waited was 4<br/>
&gt; hours).  If I could stay level 48 for the rest of my EQ <br/>
&gt; carreer, but have a<br/>
&gt; lot of fun and always be grouped in the process, I would give <br/>
&gt; up exp in a<br/>
&gt; heartbeat.<br/>
