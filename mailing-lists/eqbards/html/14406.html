<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979890079">Think of it as being a glass of beer.  Then the correct answer is not &quot;the<br/>
glass is half empty&quot; or &quot;the glass is half full&quot;.  Instead its &quot;half way to<br/>
another beer&quot;.  =D<br/>

Hey, you try testing code all day! ;-)  I just saw a programmer get the<br/>
ultimate insult.  One of his coworkers just suggested that if he didn&#39;t like<br/>
testing he could go work on EQ.  Unfortunately my cube neighbor fell out of<br/>
his chair he laughed so hard.  <br/>
<br/>
Besides, the glass is half empty cause all these bugs are driving me to<br/>
drink!  Come to think of it, half a glass is getting close to being half a<br/>
swallow!  ;-)<br/>

	Happy, just not happy with EQ!</div>
