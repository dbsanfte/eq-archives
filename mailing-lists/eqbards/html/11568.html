<div id="ygrps-yiv-960593470">I have a boon to ask of ye, me friends.<br/>
I have need of a better map to the ruins of lower Guk. The maps I have found<br/>
from the many cartographers around fail to lead me true.<br/>
Any help you may offer in this manner would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

[OOC: The maps out there that I have found fail to show the Assassin room. I<br/>
would love to be able to get there, or near, to get a basalt Carapace to<br/>
wear (and perhaps one of the new masks)<br/>
I was in lower Guk much of last night, and both were up for free loot, but I<br/>
could not find a guide to the assassin room. by the time I did find a guide<br/>
(a few hours later), There were only 20 people in the zone, and bad things<br/>
were everywhere. I did get greaves and gauntlets. Much better to wear than<br/>
bronze]</div>
