<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357878732">two new &quot;test&quot; songs.  i wonder if the first is a full mana drain like<br/>
dirge.  now that is a lot more useful than a crappy AE dmg once an hour.<br/>
<br/>

Type:  Buffing song for increasing the power of the party. <br/>
Actual Effects: Party: Divine Aura. <br/>

 <br/>
Name:  BARD TEST SONG II. <br/>
Level:  60. <br/>
Mana:  Not Required. <br/>
Song Type:  Brass, not required. <br/>
Vendor:  Unknown. <br/>
Approx Spell Cost:  Unknown. <br/>
Type:  General Purpose song of varied benefits. <br/>
Actual Effects: Target: Decrease Attack Speed by 31%. <br/>
Target: DoT for 250 hp. <br/>
Description: This song will lower the attack speed of the target slightly<br/>
less than Selo&#39;s Consanant Chain. It will also do 250 damage to the target<br/>
over the duration. The real advantage of this song is that it has a duration<br/>
of 10 ticks (1 minute), allowing the bard to weave more than 3 songs. This<br/>
is the first bard song to have a duration of more than 3 ticks.<br/>
