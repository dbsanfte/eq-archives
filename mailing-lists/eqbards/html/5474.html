<div id="ygrps-yiv-97256800"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think for a while and can&#39;t come up with any other<br/>
&gt; reasonable explanation ....my account has been accessed<br/>
&gt; without my knowledge or consent, and all my bits and<br/>
&gt; pieces have been &quot;donated&quot; away to persons unknown.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please keep us informed as to what happens with this<br/>
situation if you would. I&#39;m curious to know what <br/>
Verant&#39;s position is on security matters such as this.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I could think of is that somehow or<br/>
another, someone logged in and for whatever reason,<br/>
the server logged them in as you. Instead of logging<br/>
out and trying again, they sold all of your stuff. It<br/>
seems to me that it would be fairly hard to actually<br/>
hack into someone else&#39;s account unless they knew you<br/>
and you had a fairly easy password to guess.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m always taking screenshots of my<br/>
inventory to show what I have. Granted, if I ever<br/>
lose it - Verant may not be willing to reimburse me,<br/>
but at the least I can tell them everything I&#39;ve<br/>
lost.</div>
