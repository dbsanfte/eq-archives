<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006119232">It is AC 2 Cha +5 but the last time I went looking for Drosco, he no<br/>
longer spawns where he once did. He is not an unnnamed zombie that spawns<br/>
somewhere else entire :(<br/>
<br/>
My enchanter still wears hers. But... I have no clue where to get it now :(<br/>

&gt;There is a magic necklace that is a good item for low to mid level bards<br/>
&gt;that is fairly easy to acquire solo.  Its called the Order of Thunder (no<br/>
&gt;drop) and is found off a named zombie in the Qeynos aqueducts.  Its been a<br/>
&gt;while since I wore it (got a Cape of the Midnight Mist now) but IIRC one of<br/>
&gt;the bonuses is +5 charisma.  It also has a small AC boost as well as<br/>
&gt;function as a light source.  Check out a spoiler site if you want to know<br/>
&gt;all the stats on it.<br/>
