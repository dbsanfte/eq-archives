<div id="ygrps-yiv-432780919"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Money has NEVER been a problem for me... though granted I&#39;ve never seen more<br/>
&gt; than 50 platinum in any one place and it boggles my mind to see people<br/>
&gt; buying things through auction for 1000 plat or more.... what has been a<br/>
&gt; problem for ME is levelling.  Partied with my friends I have ALOT of fun but<br/>
&gt; I rarely get much of the experience from any given series of kills... which<br/>
&gt; only gets worse because they keep getting farther and farther ahead of me...<br/>
&gt; and since 12th level I&#39;ve been virtually incapable of soloing much of<br/>
&gt; anything that gives me experience without getting my butt killed.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; playing this game since the first week it went public, and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
&gt; my bard since the very day that the Bristlebane server opened... and she is<br/>
&gt; only 16th level.. about two bubbles from 17th.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So... anyone have any ideas?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Blues you should be able to solo at 16th (I&#39;m also 16th and solo all of these):<br/>
<br/>
Elite orcs in crushbone<br/>
Elite gnolls in blackburrow<br/>
Nobles in paw (exceptional loot)<br/>
Mammoth calves in everfrost<br/>
Elephant calves in south karana<br/>
Lion patriarchs/matriarchs in east karana<br/>
Beatles (borer?) in north karana<br/>
Alligators in oasis<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots more but these are the things I concentrate on when I&#39;m<br/>
soloing in the various areas.<br/>
