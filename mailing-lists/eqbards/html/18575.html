<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258592522">Group?  Bah!  Get that 2 spawn back in the cove in Lake Rathe and solo<br/>
the bejeezus outta it.  Once it stops giving good exp (around 22 or 23.... I<br/>
*think*), head out the the Hermit&#39;s (or &quot;Hermie&quot;, as I like to call him) Hut<br/>
in South Karana and do the same thing.  After that?  Easy.  Head to the<br/>
gobbie mines in Ill Omen on Kunrak until yer about 30 (ye&#39;ll be soloing them<br/>
well before that).  At 30, go visit the Sarnak fortress.  There is a<br/>
reeeeeally nice spot just beyond the end of the path (after it goes past the<br/>
tower, and into the CY area) to the far right.  It&#39;s a flat area near the<br/>
2nd level of the fortress, and *perfect* to pull to.<br/>
    There is a lil&#39; trick you can do to fight multiple spawns there, but as<br/>
it&#39;s prolly considered an &quot;exploit&quot;.  If ye get on the flat area next to the<br/>
fortress, go straight until you hit the zone wall, then move up the steep<br/>
part (to the right) until you stop.  If you pull to there, then Screech, the<br/>
creatures will run through you to that lil invisble corner and run in place.<br/>
As I said, this is prolly considered an exploit, so use it at yer own risk.<br/>
Other than that, the recruits, legionairres and dragoons (only faced one<br/>
dragoon thus far, so they could be tougher) are quite soloable (low blues).<br/>
There are aome casters there also, but it seems PS is a bit slower than<br/>
their casting time, so I jusst avoid them :oP<br/>
