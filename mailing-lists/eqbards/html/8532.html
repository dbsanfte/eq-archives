<div id="ygrps-yiv-34566043">I have dual ykeshas... my friends got them for me after i helped them camp<br/>
the lord for at least 3 sets of the things. a lvl 45+ bard makes the lord<br/>
room easy, I just lull the two guards and pull the lord. Then wait awhile.<br/>
Then lull one guard and pull the other. Then wait some more, and then go<br/>
kill the last guard and camp the room. Lull failed? Thats ok, you can send<br/>
at least one of the guards off chasing pixies while the group kills the<br/>
lord. So yes, you usually have to pass on the ykeshas till everybody else<br/>
has one, but doing the lord room is nothing special for a bard, and all lvl<br/>
45+ bards should have them (they dont have to use them, they should just<br/>
have them :). <br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the lord room gives some great experiance. Better than the<br/>
lava crawlers, kobolds, or any other place i can find for a lvl 47+<br/>
individual. <br/>

&gt;&gt;LOL - you really meant 45-50th bard for those items? <br/>
&gt;&gt;Those items fall within those level ranges and are very <br/>
&gt;&gt;acquireable by a NON-TWINKED bard at lvl 40+. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You are absoutely right.  I was in the Lord&#39;s room and<br/>
&gt;Frenzied room just the other night.  Here&#39;s what I mean:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/g SWORD!  He&#39;s got the sword.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;[insert battle here]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/g Wooohoo!!!<br/>
&gt;/shout YKESHA!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Party says &#39;Who gets it?  Someone who can use it.  No casters<br/>
&gt;            and the bard doesn&#39;t need it.  Here Warrior.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Who in their right mind is gonna give a bard a Ykesha or fbbs?<br/>
&gt;Twinked:  someone handed those items to the person through guild<br/>
&gt;connections.  Plus going on their knowledge alone, I would say<br/>
&gt;they didnt earn them (or someone bought an Ebay account, muhaha)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry for the confusion. =)<br/>
