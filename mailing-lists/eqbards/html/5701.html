<div id="ygrps-yiv-286578484">Ok actually lots of places.  <br/>
Place 1: Blackburrow, doesn&#39;t mean much anymore as I&#39;m not there a lot since<br/>
passing 15 but doing Lullaby around the Elite Guards would draw every Burly<br/>
gnoll and Gnoll out of the woodwork.<br/>
<br/>
Place 2: Paw, same problem basicly, but I still hunt Nobles and Commanders<br/>
here as well as the named guys.  I dont want a bunch of green guards jumping<br/>
in while I am fighting the commanders or named Shamans.<br/>
<br/>
Place 3: Kerra Isle, I draw the blue Clawknights and Pridesman and<br/>
Priestesses usually, lullaby here would also bring on hordes of males,<br/>
females, and huntresses.<br/>
<br/>
Place 4: As you noted the outdoor zones, especially the bandits in W Karana.<br/>
I&#39;d love to use lullaby on the caster groups so we can sweep a bandit camp<br/>
and move on, but all it takes is a couple of who green grizzlies and things<br/>
get out of hand fast.  <br/>
<br/>
Place 5: I can&#39;t imagine the nightmare this would cause in Crushbone as<br/>
every green Centurion in range started stunning me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, these are the situations that come to mind most.<br/>
