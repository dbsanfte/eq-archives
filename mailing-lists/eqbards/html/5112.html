&gt; At 120 charisma I consider the number of missed notes I get to<br/>
&gt; be intolerable.  I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>
&gt; of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>
&gt; this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; how any of you are able to stand it.  I worked on my enchanter<br/>
&gt; this entire weekend because I actually get to play the game,<br/>
&gt; instead of assidiously watching the chat window for &quot;missed<br/>
&gt; a note&quot; messages.  I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>
&gt; tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>
&gt; on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>
&gt; to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>
&gt; frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it me or have the nerfed casters in general.  I play a level 17<br/>
magician and a level 22 bard and I have noticed the following occurences.  <br/>
<br/>
1.  My bard has been missing notes very frequently on songs from lvl3 -<br/>
lvl22.  This occurs quite frequently even with the lower level songs.<br/>
<br/>
2.  My mage now fizzles quite frequently on her bread and butter spells.<br/>
Unlike a Wizard my mage still uses her lvl 8 shock of blades spell and<br/>
will frepuently sit down and cast summons from level 4 group of spells<br/>
(food, water and bandages).  And she now suffers from numerous fizzles and<br/>
this spell has been interrupted. <br/>
<br/>
Now I have talked to a wizard friend of mine and he is noticing that his<br/>
casting is now  fizzling/interuppting quite frequently also.  This is<br/>
leading me to believe that casters are being nerfed in some way.  Has<br/>
anyone asked their caster friends if they are suffering from the same<br/>
problem??  If they are, then casters are being nerfed.<br/>
