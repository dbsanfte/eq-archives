<div id="ygrps-yiv-488155190">no didn&#39;t know that heh.  funny that VP is cleared and Goren just walks<br/>
around safely =)  also, i think i was wrong about us killing her 3 times, i<br/>
think it was only twice.  we also have not tried since the fear bug was<br/>
fixed.<br/>
<br/>
the veldrak&#39;s actually does not proc much at all in the off-hand, and 13/23<br/>
is a nice ratio with the proc every so often.  i use it when i am not doing<br/>
CC, and put on the gauche when i am.  i didn&#39;t think i would get both in the<br/>
same night and have to make a choice hehe.  i have to take that kind of<br/>
stuff when i get the chance cause if a phenomenal item drops those who play<br/>
a lot more than me are going to have the points for them, but i am quite<br/>
happy with them nonetheless =)  the 2nd weekend i had all the chance in the<br/>
world to get the katana of flowing water, but it was more points than i<br/>
wanted to spend since i was low after the other 2 weapons.  then when no one<br/>
was going to take it and they lowered the points, a warrior with more than i<br/>
had jumped on it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Heheh not sure if you know this, but Gorenaire has yet to die <br/>
&gt; on Veeshan. I <br/>
&gt; took part in 2 failed attempts with FoH, and know of at least <br/>
&gt; 3 other tries. <br/>
&gt; This was pre-fear fix I think, not sure. This is why I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; been doing Vox a <br/>
&gt; lot, but she hasn&#39;t been putting out. My guild alone is too <br/>
&gt; small to handle <br/>
&gt; Gorenaire, unfortunately.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Damn, main gauche is sweet. I have the pre-patch Crysanthemum <br/>
&gt; Katana, which <br/>
&gt; is nothing special. Kinda pissed at Verant for not retroing <br/>
&gt; the VP loot <br/>
&gt; changes, but I did get a Claw of Phara Dar last time he died. <br/>
&gt; I think I&#39;d <br/>
&gt; rather have the gauche as I try to avoid offensive proccers, <br/>
&gt; but that&#39;s just <br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
