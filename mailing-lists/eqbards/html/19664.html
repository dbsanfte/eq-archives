<div id="ygrps-yiv-213630781">Actually the night was alot of fun, and I really don&#39;t care about any exp<br/>
lose (in fact, I still came out a little ahead).  What irks me and cast a<br/>
dark shroud over the evening was the callous disregard this individual<br/>
showed me.  Assuming I had logged out sooner, I would have had a completely<br/>
different picture of this evening.<br/>

Would you really rather have not had an entire evening of awesome grouping<br/>
so that you wouldn&#39;t lose a little experience?  Treasure your lower levels<br/>
while you still can.  As my level 48 rogue, I often just sit waiting for a<br/>
group for hours on end (not kidding here, longest I&#39;ve ever waited was 4<br/>
hours).  If I could stay level 48 for the rest of my EQ carreer, but have a<br/>
lot of fun and always be grouped in the process, I would give up exp in a<br/>
heartbeat.</div>
