<div id="ygrps-yiv-93144891">That&#39;s OK Rokenn, so am I.  I used this song a lot before I had a DE <br/>
Illusion and still do when DE illusion will get me killed.  (FV <br/>
anyone?)  Have also used it to see invis the party without killing <br/>
pets.  Easier to mem a song and play it than wait for a caster to mem <br/>
and buff everyone.<br/>

&gt; ANY bard that is wasting a song slot to sing this should be booted. <br/>
Get a<br/>
&gt; cold stone, get a DE mask (I know level 3 bards with this), get a <br/>
glowing<br/>
&gt; stone band, get a caster to cast ultra vision on you. WHATEVER. <br/>
This song is<br/>
&gt; useless, and to try to justify it by saying that there are a few <br/>
select uses<br/>
&gt; for it is being argumentative.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This song rates up there with Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge, Melody of <br/>
Ervaj and<br/>
&gt; Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord.<br/>

&gt; that would have been a correct statement if you had added &#39;&#39;to me&#39;&#39; <br/>
at the <br/>
&gt; end of &#39;&#39;it is useless&#39;&#39;.  if you were a human bard without a dark <br/>
elf mask,<br/>
&gt; i believe you would find it very useful.<br/>
