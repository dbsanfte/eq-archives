any info on where the song is found?  i think the 5 bard vendors have been<br/>

It has no effect at all on Clarity and the rate at which your party members<br/>
regen mana.<br/>
 <br/>
The Desperate Dirge is VERY powerful for a bard song.  Most bard songs are<br/>
classified as cantrips, quick little spells that have minor duration and<br/>
impact when song once, but add up over time.  This song breaks out of that<br/>
mold completely.  The mana use, and the lack of regen, was needed to keep it<br/>
from being overused.  As the name implies, it&#39;s a last ditch effort on the<br/>
bard&#39;s part to end a combat.  <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;d kicked around the idea of the song stunning the bard for 10 to 30<br/>
seconds as another balance factor, or using a horn or lute as a consumable<br/>
reagent, but neither proved practical, or easy to code.  The change making<br/>
bards immune to mana regen was relatively easy to implement.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s going to take at least 30 minutes of just sitting to regen all that<br/>
mana once you cast the song, twice that if you remain standing.  And thats<br/>
as it should be.  The song rivals harm touch at that level in damage done (A<br/>
43rd level SK can do 430 to a SINGLE target), and this song will hit FOUR<br/>
targets.  That&#39;s 1600 damage, fast.  It&#39;s use should be limited.  <br/>
 <br/>
And it might encourage bards to wear more mana and mana stat boosting items,<br/>
so they can have a larger mana reserve to draw from, speeding downtime<br/>
between songs a bit.  This is fine, as it means in most cases that they&#39;ll<br/>
have to give up better armor to wear the low or no AC caster tuned garb.<br/>

I read it the same way. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, the patch message seemed to indicate their would be no method<br/>
possible to speed up a bard&#39;s mana regen rate, it gave no indication of any<br/>
change that would alter how current bard songs *may* speed mana regen for<br/>
other party members (or maybe I just read it wrong). <br/>

 in addition there is no way for bards to speed up mana regen... (sorry,<br/>
