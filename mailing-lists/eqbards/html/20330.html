<div id="ygrps-yiv-72653944">Ok, we have gone over this before but I would like to request a quick<br/>
refresher course from the senior bards on the list.  I am getting ready to<br/>
go to Fear for my first time soon and I was wondering a few things about the<br/>
zone maybe you guys and gals can help me with:<br/>
<br/>
1. What kinds of items should a bard try to get in on a lotto for in fear?<br/>
As far as I understand it, the only bard stuff that drops there is the<br/>
crumby imbrued bracer?<br/>
<br/>
2. What kind of tactics should a bard use in fear?  Obviously mana song, but<br/>
what else is good up there?<br/>
<br/>
3. Got any other little tips for a bard heading to his first planar<br/>
experience?<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
