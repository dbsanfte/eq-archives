<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711858001">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Hunting is Skyshrine the other day and I stopped in<br/>
the bakery to seewhat was for sale.  Couple of drop<br/>
spells and a nifty sounding item:  Roasted walrus with<br/>
plum sauce.  First It is LORE, NO DROP and costs<br/>
105pp.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is this is some quest item.  Can anyone tell<br/>
me what?  I&#39;ve seen bard charm used to complete the<br/>
spider leg quest in SS and would like to give this one<br/>
a try...<br/>
