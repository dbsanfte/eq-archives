<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636555139">Halana&#39;s (the Shaman) played time (level 46) is like 50 days<br/>
(OUCH! but she has spent many days camping stuff, or just goofing).  <br/>
<br/>
		Tani&#39;s (the Bard) played time (level 17) is like 7 days or<br/>
so... I was much more focused....<br/>
<br/>
		Mirra (the Monkette) at level 15 is like 2.5 days or so...<br/>
<br/>
		Hmm, I&#39;m not going to calculate the actual hours played,<br/>
that might be too frightening and force me to like get a life or<br/>
something...<br/>
<br/>
		And for the record, I&#39;m employed full time but have no life<br/>
:-)<br/>

				Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a<br/>
long time and been playing EQ<br/>
				since about three weeks after release.  It<br/>
simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>
				could have a 50th Level character, let alone<br/>
more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>
				characters, each on a different server:<br/>
<br/>
				Pendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my<br/>
first character ever)<br/>
				Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22<br/>
days Played, favorite)<br/>
				Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played,<br/>
this weekend...grin)<br/>
<br/>
				I thought this much time played (678 hours)<br/>
meant I was a complete addict!<br/>
				I just have to know what the play time is on<br/>
a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>
				characters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich,<br/>
or just way smarter players<br/>
				than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?<br/>
I&#39;m not trolling...just bloody<br/>
				well amazed and curious (and obviously<br/>
jealous).<br/>
