<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046485740">Speaking of an all or nothing group i had the best fun in ages yesterday in<br/>
dreadlands.  <br/>
<br/>
The Group...<br/>
2 lizard monks, 1 warrior, 1 lizzie sk and a ranger and me pulling. <br/>
<br/>
No downtime, ranger would snare incoming mob and then we&#39;d fear kite,<br/>
nothing lasted more then 5 seconds. I&#39;d take off to pull another when it was<br/>
1/4 health.  I&#39;m definetly going to try to do that group again in dreadlands<br/>
again soon, it was very very nice xp 8)<br/>
<br/>
And there was much rejoicing as our bardic adventurer had for once no need<br/>
to &quot;play mana song&quot;<br/>

&gt;told him that he had to be kidding, it&#39;s going to take longer to kill the<br/>
&gt;mobs and you will be healing more.  He was the only caster in the group, so<br/>
&gt;I choose to buff the melee people.  After a couple minutes of arguing about<br/>
&gt;it (he found out I was right) he said, &quot;got to log, bye&quot;.<br/>

&gt;The mana song is a blessing and a curse.  Get a friggin&#39; enchanter if you<br/>
&gt;want constant mana regen.<br/>

5 casters in The Overthere. I&#39;ve never done it since as that was one of the <br/>
most boring things I&#39;ve ever done.<br/>
<br/>
I always love being in a group that has a couple of tanks as I can combat <br/>
buff them very nicely then hymn/clarity/cantana during downtime for the <br/>
casters. Definitely ideal.<br/>
