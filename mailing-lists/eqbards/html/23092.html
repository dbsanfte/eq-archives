<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532625567">I know alot of people have a haste belt but this post is more reguarding the<br/>
ones that dont.<br/>
<br/>
In skyshrine, the guardians and sentries drop some decent belts.  Now this<br/>
tends to make me think that farmers wont be selling them so the guardian<br/>
ones might just rot there.  Anyone have any idea if they&#39;re somewhat common<br/>
drops? I myself dont want to waste away my dragon faction but i&#39;m thinking<br/>
if someone i camping the guardians they might not need belts.  <br/>
<br/>
Considering the sludge girdle stats and the other 2 belts stats, i&#39;d rather<br/>
go for save vs. magic instead of mana/int. Also considering how low my<br/>
stamina is makes both sentry and guardian belts very attractive to me.  <br/>

Sludged Girdle 8ac   Cha +5, Int +5, HP +20, Mana +10   (worth 5-8k, lore<br/>
and tradeable)<br/>
Sentry Girdle  10ac  Cha +5, Agi +8, HP +10, SV M +5    (lore, tradeable, no<br/>
idea of worth)<br/>
Guardian Girdle 12ac Cha +5, Sta +8, HP +10, SV M +5    (lore, no drop)<br/>
<br/>
PS. What lev are sentries and what lev are guardians?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts/comments?<br/>
