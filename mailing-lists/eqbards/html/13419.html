<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971694768">Phin is the boss of KK.  We killed him but we were doing a guild outing and<br/>
had 3 groups with players 33 to 50.  It was my first time in Kedge so I<br/>
followed along and enjoyed some great new scenery.  I cant remember what he<br/>
looks like - sorry =(<br/>

What skill level does bard tracking stop? I hit 35 and went to my guild and<br/>
slapped 5 of my many unused points into it. Taking it up to 40, I haven&#39;t<br/>
seen it go up anymore so I&#39;m assuming this is it??<br/>
<br/>
I tracked Phinigel Atropus in Kedge today, anyone seen this thing and what<br/>
does it look like?<br/>
