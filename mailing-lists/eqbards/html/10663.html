<div id="ygrps-yiv-118217790">Personally I bind in the Arena if I can.  If I&#39;m already bound in Freeport,<br/>
then I might skip getting bound in the Arena.  If you bind at the East<br/>
Freeport gates just North of Northern Ro, then you have to zone 6 times<br/>
before you&#39;re in CT (E.FP, NRo, Oasis, SRo, Innothule, Feerrott, CT).  If<br/>
you bind in Arena you have to zone only 4 times (Lake Rathe, Rathe Mts.,<br/>
Feerrott, CT).  However, swimming Rathe is time consuming even with high<br/>
swimming (mine is maxed for my level), enough so that if I&#39;m in a hurry I&#39;ll<br/>
mem Aria of Eagles and run over the lake twisting Selo&#39;s.  Then the jog<br/>
through Rathe Mts. is kinda long and twisty if you don&#39;t know the way.  The<br/>
zones from Freeport are fairly short well known by everyone so I suppose<br/>
it&#39;s kinda a wash.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a trick that I learned going to CT from Arena.  I you bind in FP and<br/>
need to invis yourself to get back to your corpse in CT (which is quite<br/>
common), you have to run to the bank and perhaps the bard guild from your<br/>
bind point to buy a drum and flute - that&#39;s a lot of zoning unless you bind<br/>
at the bank.  If you are bound in Arena then you can&#39;t get a flute.  Or can<br/>
you?  If you check the gypsy camp near the entrance to Rathe Mts. from Lake<br/>
Rathe you&#39;ll find that they sell bardic instruments.  If I&#39;m bound in Arena<br/>
and need a flute to get to my corpse, I&#39;ll zone into Rathe Mts. and kill one<br/>
or two lizardman warriors (extrmely green) with my fists and perhaps bellow.<br/>
One or two little lizzies usually nets me enough cash to buy a flute, and<br/>
oftentimes a drum too.  Or even easier, I often have a friend or two there<br/>
at the Lake Rathe/Rathe Mts. zone fighting cyclops and such.  I just bum a<br/>
plat off of them.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The experience in CT is amazing if you get into a good group pulling lizards<br/>
nonstop.  Your rogue friend was camping ravenscale of course, but I do not<br/>
doubt that he went from 32-38 in two weeks.  I went from 30th to 34th in<br/>
something like 10 days.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;Crier, one question I have, because a couple of my guildmates<br/>
&gt; are in CZ and<br/>
&gt; keep bugging me to &quot;Come on Down !&quot;-Do you get bound in Freeport<br/>
&gt; or Arena? I<br/>
&gt; am definately sick of High Keep- and saw my Rogue guild mate shoot from<br/>
&gt; 32-38 in like 2 weeks I think.<br/>
&gt; And how long does it take you to do the corpse run if you are in Freeport?<br/>
