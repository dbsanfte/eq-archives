		Am level 16, and just got my screaming mace. I plan to dual<br/>
wield it with my <br/>
		dirk at 17 until/unless I get a tomohawk (I have about 100pp<br/>
in the bank and <br/>
		am still saving up).<br/>
<br/>
		My 1H blunt is currently 76 (the cap at level 16 is 85); I<br/>
used a fine steel <br/>
		warhammer for some levels to keep my blunt skill up, so I<br/>
should be able to <br/>
		cap out pretty easily. My dex is currently 118, and the mace<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
		proc much (but I didn&#39;t get it for the proc effect, anyway).<br/>
Quick review:<br/>
<br/>
		Screaming Mace:<br/>
		1H Blunt<br/>
		Damage: 8<br/>
		Delay: 35<br/>
		Weight: 8 (heavy!)<br/>
		Effect: Screaming Mace (Yaulp)<br/>
		Damage/Delay = 0.22857<br/>
<br/>
		Was previously using Dragoon Dirk:<br/>
		Piercing<br/>
		Damage: 6<br/>
		Delay: 23<br/>
		Weight: 2.5<br/>
		Damage/Delay = 0.2609<br/>
<br/>
		(The dirk has obviously been relegated to the ranged weapon<br/>
slot, so I can <br/>
		still get the +2 dex, +3 sv magic bonus.)<br/>
<br/>
		If nothing else, it&#39;ll be useful in fighting those pesky<br/>
fire-shielded mobs <br/>
		in Lavastorm; I used to come out severely hurt from those<br/>
fights because my <br/>
		dragoon dirk was so darn fast.<br/>
<br/>
		I&#39;ll definitely hang on to the screaming mace for a while,<br/>
to cap out my 1H <br/>
		blunt skill, if nothing else. I was considering dual<br/>
wielding a tomohawk and <br/>
		the mace at 17, since I tend to do most of my hunting solo<br/>
(Berserker <br/>
		Strength + Yaulp). Jaxan&#39;s Jig is currently one of my<br/>
regularly memorized <br/>
		songs anyway, so there haven&#39;t been any big changes to my<br/>
songlist from <br/>
		swinging around that big ole heavy thing.<br/>
<br/>
