&gt;  You can charm a scrawny crit and send him in as your alter ego to take<br/>
&gt;the Harm Touch for you. Me, I just took a &quot;rooter&quot; friend with me,<br/>
&gt;invis&#39;ed us to a safe point, pulled them there and chanted them to<br/>
&gt;death. Worked well. No sweat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yea, good idea. That would work well, as long as there&#39;s only 2. Have them <br/>
DT each other. :-) I&#39;ve read lots of posts where people have level 50 <br/>
support. But a level 35 bard could do this solo with only a small chance of <br/>
dying. &quot;Charming&quot; them is a very nice idea for pulling, if you are able to <br/>
find a safer area and then start to kill a bunch of them.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion of getting a SOW, invising and tracking down a scrounger, <br/>
Dot&#39;ing him, then running out of the canyon invis, was only 1 possible way <br/>
to do it. I&#39;ve read of some people finding safe areas in the canyons, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know where those are. Made me too nervous sitting down there amongst <br/>
all of them.<br/>
