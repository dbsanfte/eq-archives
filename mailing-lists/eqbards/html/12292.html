<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595172251">I think there is an inherent Catch-22 in the way Verant designed the game.<br/>
Too many people in a zone and you sit around bored because there aren&#39;t<br/>
enough mobs to go around for everyone.  Not enough people in the zone and<br/>
its not safe to go very deep inside due to increase chances of starting a<br/>
train.  Case in point was my party in Mistmoore the other night.  Zone<br/>
consisted of three low 20s parties camping the lake area, one party in the<br/>
graveyard, and my party in the courtyard.  Around 20-25 players total in the<br/>
zone.  My party consisted of 46 warrior, 40 cleric, 39 paladin, 39 druid, 36<br/>
monk and 30 bard (me).  We were all in the same guild and sole purpose was<br/>
to get a piece of granite from a gargoyle for the paladin (armor quest).  I<br/>
wasn&#39;t getting any experience due to the 46 warrior but wasn&#39;t worried about<br/>
it.  Had the entire courtyard to ourselves but could never get a good handle<br/>
on it.  By the time we cleared out the courtyard and medded up, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
safe to try a pull from the castle because the mobs in the courtyard we<br/>
killed first were due to respawn shortly.  A couple of times we tried<br/>
pulling from the castle and ended up starting a train.  This was primarily<br/>
due to the feign death nerf.  Everytime the monk tried to get a single pull<br/>
he ended up getting multiple mobs.  <br/>
<br/>
What would be nice is if the spawn rate in a zone scaled based on zone<br/>
population.  Using MM the other night as an example, the mobs around the<br/>
lake would spawn quicker since there were more low 20s groups camping them.<br/>
In the courtyard, the mob spawn rate slows down since there is only one<br/>
party camping them.  Not certain how this would be programmed but if it is<br/>
feasible it would help advance the dungeon crawl method of adventuring in<br/>
the zones wih a small number of people in them.  As it stands, there doesn&#39;t<br/>
appear to be anyway to go deep inside Mistmoore unless there are several<br/>
groups all working together.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; On another note, does anyone have any advice for pulling in MM or a good<br/>
&gt; place to camp?  I was wiped 3 times there last night alone from really bad<br/>
&gt; ugly looking trains that seemed to include the WHOLE castle, all of them<br/>
&gt; coming out through the graveyard (which I had imagined would be safer).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, Prexus has officially grown up I think.  1700 people on it last night<br/>
&gt; and I couldn&#39;t find anywhere to hunt in Sol B or in Lower Guk (EVERYTHING<br/>
&gt; was camped)... But when I got to MM, there were only about 12 people in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; zone... now I know why.<br/>
