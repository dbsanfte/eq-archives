 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been meaning to update the L20-40 songs on Rokenn&#39;s site,<br/>
but haven&#39;t had the time.  Here&#39;s my hunch as to what&#39;s going<br/>
on:<br/>
<br/>
Charm wipes the damage list, but doesn&#39;t seem to wipe the hate<br/>
list - only puts the bard on top.  The game prevents your pet<br/>
from attacking you, so the mob will attack whatever is next on<br/>
its hate list.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s say Ranger pulls two mobs.  He pulls a Melee mob with<br/>
an arrow, and a Caster mob comes along.<br/>
<br/>
Your group dutifully attacks Caster. <br/>
You charm Melee, and order it to attack Caster.<br/>
Melee attacks Caster.<br/>
Caster attacks your group (this is important).<br/>
Charm breaks, Melee attacks you.<br/>
You recharm, Melee looks at its hate list and Ranger is on top<br/>
  (from the original arrow) so it attacks Ranger.<br/>
<br/>
You need to give it the /pet back off command and reissue the<br/>
/pet attack command.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if Caster had attacked Melee back and done sufficient<br/>
damage to put it on top of Melee&#39;s hate list, then you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have this problem.  This is usually what happens when<br/>
you are soloing with charm.<br/>
<br/>
The hate list management also seems to be prey to the whims of<br/>
the mob AI.  Undead for example tend to attack the nearest<br/>
available target, and thus won&#39;t always retain any hatred for<br/>
stuff that&#39;s been beating them up.<br/>
