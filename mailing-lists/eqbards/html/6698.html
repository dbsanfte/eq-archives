&gt;in a normal group situation they were upgraded slightly due to the extra<br/>
&gt;tick of damage. Our DoT songs did not get the extra tick of damage, but are<br/>
&gt;subject to the damage decrease if the mob runs toward the bard when damage<br/>
&gt;is applied.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this documented somewhere?  I have heard no reports of actual damage<br/>
after the patch, then again it is going to be hard to get exact numbers with<br/>
the PvP damage changes.<br/>
<br/>
However to that other point. Since our DoTs are also area effect,I cannot<br/>
see this mattering much in any situation except kiting. One way in which we<br/>
gained reletive to other classes is that DoTs are not nerfed if the monster<br/>
is feared and running away, which is our prime &quot;kiting&quot; method. If anything<br/>
they took pains to leave our &quot;kiting&quot; alone, I mean, why else would you<br/>
exempt fear? For all those Enchanter kiters?<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I think it is a game tweak, yes, but we actually wound up on the<br/>
winning side of the equasion. All these cries of nerfing, I am not seeing<br/>
it. Yeah hide and sneak are worthless, yes I could see a tweak in defensive<br/>
skills. But I am a valued and useful member of my group, I drop some serious<br/>
damage on Fire Goblins in SolA and give everyone a chance to zone (if the<br/>
pull was too big) without getting backstabbed all the way. I have had Druids<br/>
express jelousy at all the coool things we get to do that they don&#39;t. All<br/>
without mana. What is so freakin bad? I don&#39;t feel nerfed or underpowered at<br/>
all, sorry, but in a group with a warrior, a cleric and a wizard, I kick<br/>
serious butt across a lot of situations. Why do I think I am not alone in<br/>
this?<br/>
