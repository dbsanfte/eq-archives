<br/>
Another Pixie Strike question:<br/>
<br/>
Last night in the Lake of Ill Omen, I was Pixie-ing Sarnak Adherants and<br/>
Revealers to interrupt their casting.  It worked wonderfully.<br/>
<br/>
However, when our group moved to Frontier Mountains to tackle Mountain<br/>
Giants, I&#39;d try to Pixie if we got more than one pull but it would never<br/>
work.  I got some strange message to the effect of:<br/>
<br/>
You cannot mesmerize this creature (not with this spell)<br/>
<br/>
This was on a blue Mountain Giant Hillock - they Charm easily enough.  Now,<br/>
I know there&#39;s not a level limit on the song but is there a size limit?  ie.<br/>
does it work on large creatures?<br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note, I dinged into 30 and got a Forest Loop, so I&#39;m happy.</div>
