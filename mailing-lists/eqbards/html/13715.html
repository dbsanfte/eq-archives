&gt; I have noticed the same as well.  In my mid 20s, I died quite a bit due to<br/>
&gt; &quot;bard hate&quot;.  Since I made 30th level, it hasn&#39;t been nearly the problem<br/>
&gt; like it was before.  I&#39;m finding that the damage the tanks and casters are<br/>
&gt; inflicting outweighs the taunt effect of my songs.  As a result, I&#39;m now<br/>
&gt; ending combats nearly at full health.  I&#39;ve even resorted to keeping the<br/>
&gt; heal song up several pulses to try and spread out the damage.  I died three<br/>

Fulfil&#39;s is also a good taunt if you can make it stick.  Pixie<br/>
Strike works too, and the MR debuff makes it somewhat useful<br/>
in this respect (not to mention it&#39;s a song I usually have<br/>
loaded).  So I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;d go along with a petition<br/>
to &quot;nerf&quot; it by removing the MR debuff.<br/>

The other trick we&#39;ve been using to some extent to even out<br/>
damage is one I learned on the Concert Hall boards.  Root the<br/>
mob and it&#39;ll attack whoever is closest.<br/>
