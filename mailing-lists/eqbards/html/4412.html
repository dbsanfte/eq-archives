 </span></blockquote>Ah, ok. I still have many songs to learn - but I&#39;m not as excited about any<br/>
of them as much as I am my next one.. When I get to the 16th song, I&#39;m<br/>
growing gills and becoming a fish. =)<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s in the lake in the West Commons anyway? Can you zone to/from the<br/>
Ocean Of Tears? Who needs a stinky boat - I&#39;m swimming from Freeport to<br/>
Butcherblock!<br/>
<br/>
PS: Did I ever mention the time I fell off the boat (or more acurately was<br/>
*placed* off the boat from the bottom deck) and took my swimming skill from<br/>
a 3 to just over 30 (takes just over an hour for those of you interested)<br/>
because I was too stubborn to let myself die and no GM&#39;s would answer me?<br/>
Thank goodness for the Jig keeping my stamina up..<br/>
<br/>
PSS: Does anyone else think that there should be a merchant or a bar in the<br/>
boat? I&#39;d love to see some drunken Bards roaming around the deck.. playing<br/>
silly songs.. falling off.. trying to swim while drunk..<br/>
<br/>
PSSS: Does anyone else think it would be the greatest thing to have an<br/>
undead ferryman that you had to give a copper or silver to in order to get<br/>
across the rivers around Antonica? Could even make it some Spectre type<br/>
thing like the river Styx.. The things you think about while running nekkid<br/>
from Freeport to Qeynos screaming Selo&#39;s eh?</div>
