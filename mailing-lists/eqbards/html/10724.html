&gt; While I would agree that some items are way too easy to get your hand on<br/>
&gt; (black silk gloves, shin items, lambent stones), I&#39;ve found the other items<br/>
&gt; very difficult to come by.<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; So, other then the gauntlets, I&#39;d say that none of these items is easily<br/>
&gt; obtainable by bards lower then 25th level without significant help...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, here&#39;s a recap:<br/>
<br/>
Fiery Vambraces - camped King Room for 8 hours, got them in an hour, but didn&#39;t <br/>
get the boots<br/>
<br/>
Firewalker Boots - came back to King Room, waited for 4 hours while the TWO <br/>
6-member groups killed everything in sight<br/>
<br/>
Froon and Choon - waited until the 6-member group camping them didn&#39;t need any <br/>
more runes<br/>
<br/>
Basalt Carapace, Shin Greaves - waited at the top of Lower Guk until the 6-member <br/>
group in the bedroom broadcast the drops<br/>
<br/>
Mudwater Rune - cleared the arena-like area in preparation for pulling a Fanatic, <br/>
but a soloing Warrior offered me the rune before I got around to yanking one<br/>
<br/>
Shin Gauntlets - earned them in a 6-member party pulling froggies to the zone <br/>
(lots of fun - we were offing more than one a minute).  LOTS of Gauntlets <br/>
littered the ground that night!<br/>
<br/>
It should be possible to get to the loot areas for any of these things using <br/>
Clouding, and they were so well-camped that I can&#39;t imagine anyone dying.  Not <br/>
much of a challenge.  Like I said, though, I only get to play on weekends, when <br/>
there are a LOT of people on.  (When I was in the King Room waiting for the <br/>
boots, we got a broadcast congratulating us on breaking the record for the number <br/>
of people on the server at one time, if you get the idea..)<br/>
