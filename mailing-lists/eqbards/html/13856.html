 </span></blockquote>Nah, you won&#39;t need a a background in music (I have some of that too). <br/>
The game would explain what you need to know.  Oversimplified example : <br/>
Lvl one- You know the  strength series of notes and dex series of<br/>
notes.  Your only option is to play one or both (and get less of an<br/>
effect for each).  Lvl 2 you get a harmony option which pains anyone who<br/>
hears it.  Lvl 3 a catchy rythm which energizes the listeners.  <br/>
<br/>
Pbviously I&#39;m totally stealing the EQ song list for balance sake, but<br/>
you get the idea.  No music knowledge necessary, you simply drag the STR<br/>
notes, harmony set, etc to your song page.  Perhaps at lvl one you have<br/>
a max of two components, maybe gain one every 5 levels (10?).  For<br/>
balance sake you may have to weaken each component if you have your max<br/>
number of components going, but that would be an issue for fine tuning. <br/>
That would give bards true flexibility, and also eliminate the obnoxious<br/>
key mashing we do now...<br/>
