&gt; I&#39;m interested in the binding song...and I agree that it is unlikely to be<br/>
&gt; approved.  However, here&#39;s my 2 cp:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Repeat after me:<br/>
Bards will never get Binding.  Bards will never get Binding.  Bards will<br/>
never get Binding......<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The other hybrids don&#39;t get bind...but we aren&#39;t really a hybrid class.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Each<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other hybrid is a warrior/specific magic class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bards are complete hybrids.  Bards are warrior/casters (if you equate<br/>
casting to singing).  And with the mix of song types, they are a hybrid of<br/>
many different casters.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As a result, they get magic<br/>
&gt; plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And Bards have much better battle skills than a cleric.  It isn&#39;t even<br/>
close.  Bards are much closer to Rangers than Clerics in combat abilities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; then perhaps we can get a<br/>
&gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To make up for it?  Bards have many advantages over the other hybrids in<br/>
magical abilities.  Name one other hybrid that can do damage in all these<br/>
ways: DD, AOE DD, DOT, Damage Shield.  Bards can increase just about every<br/>
stat and resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Bards might be less combat worthy compared to other hybrids, but they have<br/>
much better spells.<br/>
