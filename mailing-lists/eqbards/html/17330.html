 </span></blockquote>Best advice, since you&#39;re planning on getting a new system anyway, is to<br/>
hold off and just get the new system.  I&#39;d suggest getting the new system<br/>
WITHOUT a video card (IF the NV15 is out by then) and getting an NV15 or a<br/>
Bitboys to stick in it.  If the NV15 or the Bitboys isn&#39;t out by then go<br/>
with a GeForce 256 DDR (W/64mb Ram).<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT take a standard GeForce.  DDR is so much better it&#39;s amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Luck!<br/>
