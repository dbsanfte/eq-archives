<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ya, it is a big concern...but you didn&#39;t mention THIS!!:<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the instrument in<br/>
use.<br/>
<br/>
Wooo! *In theory* Charm and Cinda&#39;s just got stronger...<br/>
<br/>
and this too:<br/>
<br/>
- You can now right-click-and-hold on bard songs to determine what<br/>
instrument skill is used by the spell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough bits and pieces, here is the full message:<br/>
<br/>
The following is a list of changes that were implemented on the Live<br/>
EverQuest servers today:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Spells*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You will now receive a message when attempting to mesmerize a creature<br/>
that is immune to that type of spell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You can now right-click-and-hold on bard songs to determine what<br/>
instrument skill is used by the spell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Dyn&#39;s Dizzying Draught has had its casting time lowered significantly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Corrected a bug in the Druid root+damage spells (Enveloping roots series)<br/>
that caused the spell&#39;s damage to have a chance of breaking the spell. They<br/>
work much better now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- The Magicians Phantom Armor series now grants HP regeneration.<br/>
<br/>
- The Druid spell, dance of the fireflies, has been changed from &quot;Outdoor<br/>
only&quot; to &quot;Night only&quot;. It may now be cast in dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
- Corrected a typographical error that allowed high level magicians to<br/>
inscribe the Malosi spell. It was not intended for magicians under level 50.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*General Changes/Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity. If a deity<br/>
restriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you<br/>
right-click-and-hold on the item.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- The AC on the mid-level cleric quest armor has been increased.<br/>
<br/>
- The Terror Mask will now cast &quot;Fear&quot; instead of &quot;Call of Bones&quot; as<br/>
previously announced. The &quot;Call of Bones&quot; effect was placed on this item by<br/>
mistake.<br/>
<br/>
- The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- The Quest for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Some spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Five spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor of Ro<br/>
(Paladin) quests. They have been fixed and Paladins should have a much<br/>
easier time of obtaining their armor.<br/>
<br/>
- Pets should now attack Willowisps on command.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate<br/>
action of the spell. Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your spell line-up.<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the instrument in<br/>
use.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Kerra Ridge*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kerra Ridge has been completely revamped. The target level-range for the<br/>
zone has been slightly increased. In addition, many new quests have been<br/>
added to the zone. The faction for Kerrans has been changed so that those<br/>
who killed them indiscriminately before today&#39;s update can take part. Be<br/>
warned that the Kerrans still do not like everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Paw*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Paw has received another minor difficulty adjustment. In addition, item drop<br/>
percentages have been increased.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*The Plane of Hate*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Plane of Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp. Take care in<br/>
your exploration of this zone as many things have changed.<br/>
<br/>
