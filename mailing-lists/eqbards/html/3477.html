I ne&#39;er said it was ineffective.. just not as effective as it might be.  And<br/>
since it is the only song I have yet encountered that did not fail just did<br/>
not have much of an effect even on a green it struck me as a concern. :)<br/>

&gt; I have seen a number of complaints here by those just making lvl 15 that<br/>
&gt; Lullaby is ineffective.  Well IMHO Lullaby is one of the absolute most<br/>
&gt; useful songs I have in my arsenal, ranked right up there with Consonant<br/>
&gt; Chain and Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I would like to stress here - MOST BARD SONGS ARE NOT VERY<br/>
&gt; EFFECTIVE AT THE LEVEL YOU GET THEM! Give it a couple levels, get your<br/>
&gt; skills up in the requisite instrument - All of a sudden the songs are more<br/>
&gt; effective, being resisted less, you are missing fewer notes etc..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find the Lullaby particulary useful for train control. Last night in<br/>
Cazic<br/>
&gt; Thule i was hunting with a barbarian warrior and a human cleric. He pulled<br/>
&gt; from the throne room and a spawn occured and we were fighting 2 gorillas<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; a lizard. Well with Lullaby, the two gorillas slept like babies.  Now yeah<br/>
&gt; they woke up, but a couple rounds after the &quot;nod off&quot; message, they were<br/>
&gt; sleeping again and we all fought the lizard, moved to the next gorilla and<br/>
&gt; then killed the last one. Could I do this effectively at 15th level even<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; greens - NO! However as I have grown, the effectiveness of this song has<br/>
&gt; grown with me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The same thing with Selo Consanant Chain.  When I first got this at 23 it<br/>
&gt; was resisted 80% of the time. That is down to about 25% of the time<br/>
against<br/>
&gt; blues now, meaning that if I repeatedly sing this song i *can* stop a<br/>
runner<br/>
&gt; before it goes and brings friends.  Be patient, experiment, practice. Make<br/>
&gt; your level, rinse and repeat &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Big disadvantage of Lullaby - cannot be juggled<br/>
&gt; Big advantage of Lullaby - GREAT TO INTERRUPT THOSE PESKY CASTERS!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my 2 copper.....<br/>
