&gt; I was wondering if anyone is having the same problem I am with the level 38<br/>
&gt; song.<br/>
&gt; EVERYTHING resists me!  I find it very funny that EVERYTHING RESISTS a level<br/>
&gt; 38 song (Chant) but almost nothing resists a level 12 song (Bellow).  Can<br/>
&gt; anyone confirm for me that this song actually works????  It isn&#39;t doing a<br/>
&gt; thing for me!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, what sort of things are you killing?  If you&#39;re in Sol B, yeah, you&#39;re going to get<br/>
resisted a ton.  Chant of flame has 2 strikes against it.  First, its a fire based dot, so it<br/>
checks a mobs fire resistance, and everything in the Soluseks has really a really high<br/>
resist to fire.  Bellow and most of our other songs check a mobs magic resist, which<br/>
is generally lower.  Secondly, Chant does damage *and* lowers fire resistance.<br/>
Dual effect songs are always more often resisted than single effect songs.  You might<br/>
also notice this with Denons discord vs. Chords of Dissonance.<br/>
