I carry a couple head items with me. If I were you I would hang onto that<br/>
Mane Attraction so you don&#39;t have to bother with the Siryn Hair Hood (which<br/>
I usually wear). I did not know the stats of the Mane. If I wear you, I&#39;d<br/>
get another helm with good AC to switch to when Cha isn&#39;t needed and you&#39;re<br/>
in battle so looks aren&#39;t *as* important. Lambent is good (which I use<br/>
because it has to be blue to match my outfit hehe), but Skull Shape Barbute<br/>
stats are wonderful :) Oh, and hang onto the BI crown for the resists when<br/>
you do dragon raids, which imo is the only time we really need to worry<br/>
about the resist gear. Our songs give us great resists!<br/>
<br/>
As far as earrings go, I was a charisma queen until about 45, when I<br/>
realized it just wasn&#39;t too important anymore. I still leave on one of my<br/>
Opalline earrings (it&#39;s 2ac also), but on my other ear I have a +4 Str one.<br/>
<br/>
Take care and hope to run into you one of these days.<br/>

&gt;I recently posted a request for feedback on whether I should equip an<br/>
&gt;Executioner Hood or Blackened Iron Crown.  Another factor has entered the<br/>
&gt;equation now that I was able to complete the Mane Attraction quest.  If you<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t familiar with it, the Mane Attraction quest is a sub quest for the<br/>
&gt;ranger Raincaller bow quest.  Part of the quest requires rangers to give<br/>

&gt;good thing about this is that you don&#39;t have to be a ranger to complete the<br/>
&gt;Mane Attraction quest.  It will take a high level party to go deep into<br/>
&gt;Kedge to get one of the components but other than that the other components<br/>
&gt;are fairly easy to acquire.  One good thing about the Mane is that there is<br/>
&gt;no visible headpiece so now I don&#39;t look like a cross between a Vulcan and<br/>

&gt;When wearing the Mane, I lose one AC compared to the Exe Hood and BI Crown<br/>

&gt;that the BI Crown gives.     Is +10 to CHR more important than +5 to all<br/>
&gt;resists?  The jury remains out on that.  I suppose I could replace the 2<br/>
