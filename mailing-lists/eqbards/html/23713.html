<div id="ygrps-yiv-672435363"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; hmm, speaking of memblur, i wonder what would happen if i threw a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>charm on it after the malo and slow but long before the mez broke.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, it&#39;s does nothing unless I break mez before <br/>
applying charm.  (I could be wrong on this)  It also doesn&#39;t work on <br/>
anything 51+, and it&#39;s tough to twist that if you&#39;re mezzing 3.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;d just be &quot;nice&quot; to have a higher taunt.  Sure, give the panzies <br/>
in the dress the high taunt mezz and us the low taunt one. :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if something breaks, I&#39;d rather have it hitting me for <br/>
another reason.. I can easily hit &lt;Esc&gt; to get it in my target, <br/>
rather than deal with Verant&#39;s buggy Targeting system.  <br/>
