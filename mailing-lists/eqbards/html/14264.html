Perhaps you could borrow a Staff of Writhing and a Groteque Mask from a<br/>
friend to lower your CHR even more.  Not certain what else out there lowers<br/>
CHR.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; You got slightly fewer secondary resists than me (163/415 =<br/>
&gt; 39.3% with lute).  This would support the theory that they<br/>
&gt; have a sign error in the charisma bonus for secondary resists,<br/>
&gt; as my charisma was 154 vs your 133.  I&#39;ll have to test it<br/>
&gt; again tonight - I&#39;ll try to get to BB and get a skunk to spray<br/>
&gt; me, if they can still affect me at all.<br/>
