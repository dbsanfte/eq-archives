<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034023138">Of course it happens on other servers..  and most folks will have had<br/>
similar experiences with varying degrees of &quot;seriousness&quot;.  The minute that<br/>
you start grouping with other people there is a certain amount of trust that<br/>
is involved.  You have to trust them to tank, heal, taunt, stun, mez, etc.,<br/>
but you also have to trust them to be honest with the looting.  Whenever<br/>
you&#39;re in a pickup group this is hightened.  No one knows one another and<br/>
looting could be questioned.  Personally I have done two things that make my<br/>
life run more smoothly in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
1) When I&#39;m in a pickup group and we&#39;re camping a rare whatsit, I try and<br/>
defer looting to others, especially if there are obvious d00ds, powergames,<br/>
or hotheads in the group.  The possibility for contention is just too high<br/>
and I value my reputation as a fair loot distributor.  I just won&#39;t do it.<br/>
Let the &quot;d00d&quot; loot it and say it didn&#39;t have anything - let him take the<br/>
heat.  I don&#39;t mean this as a criticism, in fact my experience with<br/>
incidents such as you describe brought me around to this way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
2) I have joined a guild that is extremely trustworthy and group with them<br/>
regularly.  When my guildmate says &quot;It didn&#39;t have anything&quot;, I believe him<br/>
without question.  If he weren&#39;t trustworthy he simply wouldn&#39;t last in the<br/>
guild for more than two weeks.<br/>

&gt; future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more<br/>
&gt; clear rules<br/>
&gt; set up.  Does this happen on other servers?  Has this happened to any of<br/>
&gt; you?<br/>
