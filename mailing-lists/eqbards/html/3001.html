your ping time.  Your computer is basically taking 0.6 sec to<br/>
1.1 sec to exchange information with the server.  I&#39;m frankly<br/>
amazed you&#39;re able to twist at all as I basically gave up when<br/>
UUNet was crapping out and giving me 600ms pings.  You&#39;re not<br/>

Get a new ISP.  (It might not really be your ISP&#39;s fault - it<br/>
could be their default route is through a flakey backbone far<br/>
upstream from them.  But the only way to fix it is to change<br/>
ISPs.)<br/>

The number on the right is the data rate, and shouldn&#39;t really<br/>
matter unless it starts to get up beyond what your modem can<br/>
handle.<br/>
