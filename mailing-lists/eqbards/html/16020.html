<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825444226">Well, honestly, regarding the split... I think they did a good job and MAYBE<br/>
need to move another 200.  In my opinion, its not that the server is crowded<br/>
- on Solusek Ro now, other than Sunday afternoon, we are consistently in the<br/>
top third of the least crowded, non PvP servers.  The problem, in my<br/>
opinion, is that we have too many high level players.  After the &quot;split&quot; I<br/>
can now log in to a 1200 person server (well within reasonable expectations)<br/>
but the population of lower guk is still close to 100, sol b 70 and the<br/>
planes 30-50.  I think perhaps John was right that we need to learn how to<br/>
pull from the planes in order to support more people - that would help.<br/>
<br/>
But as for Verant giving us more servers in order to keep population at<br/>
under 1000, frankly, I don&#39;t see it happening.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, the whole server split makes me sad.  I lost a lot of good friends<br/>
even moving 200 people.  I suppose that&#39;s the way it goes<br/>
though................<br/>

&gt;And this is AFTER the split...............<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What split?<br/>
Taking 200 people off of the server is NOT what I call<br/>
a split. It was a nice gesture. They need to remove a LOT<br/>
more people before you can consider it a split. (say, 800 or<br/>
1000)<br/>
