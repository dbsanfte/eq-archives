<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009598598">I have had two groups like this recently.  I have a personal policy I stick<br/>
to, if you start telling me how to play my bard then I am leaving.  I left<br/>
both groups and never looked back.  I am a damn good bard that doesn&#39;t need<br/>
to be told what to do.  Grrrrr.  I actually had a rogue in my group the<br/>
other night that told the casters to shut up for me.  lol.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Well, it finally happened to me.  I haven&#39;t played in a lot of pickup<br/>
&gt;groups, but have done a bit.  And until now, I&#39;ve not heard this phrase<br/>
&gt;uttered.  I thought I had escaped it.  But noooooooooo... the pickup group I<br/>
&gt;got last night was the WORST I&#39;ve had in EQ that I can remember.<br/>
&gt;.........edit......<br/>
&gt;The wizard &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing manasong?&quot;... me... &quot;uh, I am&quot;...<br/>
&gt;her...&quot;well just play it all the time&quot;.... me ... &quot;nope&quot;... her... &quot;well you<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t a very good bard are you?&quot;... me... &quot;nope&quot;<br/>
&gt;.........edit......<br/>
&gt;Ok so I was a little sarcastic, but I wont even get into the pulling<br/>
&gt;techniques used by the ranger... Needless to say, I took the advice of<br/>
&gt;someone here and with a &quot;OMG I think my roommate just dropped something bad<br/>
&gt;.. heard a crash have to go check it out&quot;.. I logged... but wowowowow...<br/>
&gt;what an experience. </span></blockquote></div>
