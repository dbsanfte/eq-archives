<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611621629">I&#39;m interested in applying to this guild, but I&#39;m curious: is there a server restriction, or can a bard from Tunare also join?<br/>

    Hail again:<br/>
    <br/>
    A couple of comments:<br/>
    <br/>
    Although 10 platinum is hard to earn at the lower levels, if you focus your efforts, you&#39;ll find that it only takes a few hours around your 7th or 8th rank to earn that much.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now, for those of you who are interested in benifitting earlier, here is a direct quote from our Academy application page regarding student&#39;s tuition:<br/>
    <br/>
    &quot;The Soerbaird must pay a tuition of 10 platinum to enter the Academy. Upon graduation from the Academy, a monthly fee will be exacted from each member according to their station. For those of you with questions about the fee, please mail Jythri.<br/>
    <br/>
    The initial fee for joining the guild is only 1 platinum. The rest of the 10 platinum tuition is due upon your reaching 10th level.&quot;<br/>
    <br/>
    Please note that this text is not hidden or clouded in anyway, and that upon your initial entry in the guild, you are only required to pay 1 platinum, with the rest paid later. I paid my 1 platinum at level 2, with most of the other Ollave, so I know it can be done. For the record, I also paid my remaining 9 platinum into the guild treasury at level 8, within the first week and a half of Norrath&#39;s awakening.<br/>
    <br/>
    The fee is high, yes, but so are our standards. We expect much from our bards, and the willingness to contribute to the guild is one of the first tests they must pass.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you&#39;re considering applying to our guild, please read our Academy Application information (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com/academy/default.htm)">http://www.soerbaird.com/academy/default.htm)</a> carefully, because we abide strictly by what is written there.<br/>
    <br/>
    Listen and Live.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply">     &gt;    I now have just a couple of questions.  First regarding the Soerbaird<br/>
    &gt;Guild.  I am very proud that members of my calling would have such<br/>
    &gt;altruistic ideals, but I would like to ask how newer students could afford<br/>
    &gt;10 PP?  I have just recently achieved the 7th level of ascendance and I<br/>
    &gt;don&#39;t think I have ever had 10 PP.  Of course money has never been high on<br/>
    &gt;my list priorities.  I tend to lean toward the virtues of Wine, Women and<br/>
    &gt;Song. </span></blockquote></div>
