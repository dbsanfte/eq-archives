&gt;I really like the letter Greg, concise, not whiny and short.  the only<br/>
&gt;change I&#39;d suggest is to the quests part.  How about any mid or high level<br/>
&gt;bard quests.  Right now there are neither since the only dangerous one to a<br/>
&gt;mid level is the Winds of Karana quest which can net you a nifty spell like<br/>
&gt;Uh, Chant of Battle, which every bard starts with.<br/>

first one.<br/>
