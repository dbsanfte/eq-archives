<br/>
System wise, you&#39;re really just about maxxed out where processor power will<br/>
help.  After about a PII 300 your game performance has just about peaked as<br/>
far as the processor is concerned.  Not very much is handled by the<br/>
processor anyway.  Most is handled by your Video Card and your Network<br/>
Interface (modem or network card).  Also important is your sound card.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what discussions were held regarding the SB Live! 3d Sound<br/>
systems but I have had no problems with it other than when Verant goofed up<br/>
their interface code and thus caused anyone using the SB Live! to have<br/>
problems.  It wasn&#39;t a deficiency with the card, it was a deficiency with<br/>
the software drivers and the EQ program.<br/>
<br/>
System Recommendation:<br/>
<br/>
Any PIII - Just because you&#39;re going to need those to do anything soon.<br/>
PII&#39;s are out dated now :(<br/>
RAM:  128mb +  (I&#39;d recommend going with 256) (I have 512mb ram and use 350<br/>
of it as a Ram Drive for my Windows Swap File)<br/>
HD:  Anything fast<br/>
Video:  TNT2 chipset or GForce DDR (The GForce DDR is better but cost wise<br/>
the TNT2 is adequate with the new NV15 coming out soon I&#39;d spend $50-$80 and<br/>
get a TnT2 Ultra to hold you till then instead of a GForce)  A lot of people<br/>
say that Voodoo technology is better but only in 16 bit color.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
support 32 bit at all and 32 bit is the future.  Also, the TNT2&#39;s video<br/>
performance is just as good as 2 Voodoo2&#39;s in SLI mode (though a bit darker<br/>
which can be fixed by configuring the card).  And the GForce DDR is an<br/>
amazing improvment over that where the Voodoo5 or whatever that thing is<br/>
called is just a speed improvement for the Voodoo3 3000.  Voodoo is a dying<br/>
technology.  NVidia keeps raising the bar on graphics while Voodoo<br/>
technology is sticking with the same platform and trying to speed it up.<br/>
<br/>
Sound:  Currently I have yet to see anything better than either Turtle Beach<br/>
or Sound Blaster<br/>
<br/>
Oh.. and get a game pad ;)  EQ is wonderful with a good programmable game<br/>
pad.  I have a friend that swears by a programmable joystick though... hehe<br/>
either way, it&#39;s better than using the keyboard and mouse for every darn<br/>
thing.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Speaking of building a new machine, what do you recommend as far as<br/>
hardware<br/>
&gt; is concerned for a relatively high-end system that EQ will run well on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I currently use Dual SLI Voodoo2 cards and glide drivers and I know there<br/>
&gt; are issues with Mip mapping, gamma correction, and clip plane on other<br/>
&gt; chipsets (TnT?). What would be the best choice AGP 3d hardware out there<br/>
&gt; these days in everyone&#39;s opinion?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also hear all kinds of problems with the Soundblaster 3d live cards that<br/>
&gt; we have discussed here, what do people in general feel is the best sound<br/>
&gt; hardware solution?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometime within the next few months I too hope to upgrade from my current<br/>
&gt; Pii333 PCI bus machine to a whiz-bang platform but with all the choices<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure what direction to go in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize this is pretty off topic but if anyone has any sound advice I<br/>
&gt; would greatly appreciate it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; dunno i will try after i build my new super-mega gaming<br/>
&gt; &gt; machine tomorrow.  i<br/>
&gt; &gt; know i can not do it now on a pii-333, 128mb, pos compaq on cablemodem<br/>
&gt; &gt; connection.  maybe piii-733 with 3d prophet ddr will help woohoo.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I know that the theory says that 3 songs should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; optimized, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been weaving 4 when soloing out of a vague feeling<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the total<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; effect was most beneficial (at level 24-26 it&#39;s been DDD,<br/>
&gt; &gt; CoD, Chains,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hymn). With the new DoT messages it appears that I can keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everything going<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the DoTs wear off as I am starting the new DoT. (I play<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on a P2 266 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 56K modem and this is still no problem most places). Am I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; missing something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still?<br/>
