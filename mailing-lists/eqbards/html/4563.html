<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258574296"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 50 is when you&#39;re at your peak so to speak <br/>
&gt; in my opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well then I would say don&#39;t use reality as<br/>
&gt; an argument to back up your stance then.<br/>
&gt; You want stats that improve as you<br/>
&gt; progress, you don&#39;t want realism.<br/>
&gt; starting level 1 when you&#39;re at your peak,<br/>
&gt; and never suffering the effects of aging.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That depends on your view of realism. If you believe that you start out &quot;at<br/>
your peak&quot; then it would be all downhill from there, which makes no sense<br/>
since your other skills currently improve as you go. If you&#39;re starting at<br/>
your peak, all your skills should be peaked as well, and decline from there<br/>
due to old age. If you believe that you start as a newbie with no experience<br/>
or skills, then you&#39;re starting young and the best you can be is (currently)<br/>
at level 50 - which to me would be your &quot;peak&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not saying people should be able to<br/>
&gt; raise their skills to uncomprehendable<br/>
&gt; numbers with skill points, but they should <br/>
&gt; be able to raise them to their natural<br/>
&gt; maximums over time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ack!  That&#39;s even worse! You want everyone<br/>
&gt; to be clones of each other?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You misunderstood me. I didn&#39;t mean that ALL of their abilities should be<br/>
able to be raised to their maximums at the same time, but more that the<br/>
maximums should stay the maximums. So that if I for example had a maximum<br/>
possibility of 110 STR, I would never be able to increase STR past that<br/>
(without magical means). I&#39;m also not talking about major modifications over<br/>
a character&#39;s life. It could be something as little as 1 point ever other<br/>
level for a total of 25 points possible in a characters life. Over what, 7<br/>
possible places to put that and if you kept the maximums on each one -<br/>
that&#39;s really not that much of a difference, but would still help those that<br/>
wish they could build up their strength or charisma or something.</div>
