<br/>
No offense to the wizard players out there, but most wizards don&#39;t have a<br/>
clue how to play effectively in a group.<br/>

&gt; All I know is that a level 50 necro in the group allowed us to take the<br/>
&gt; lords room in lower guk easily and hold the room for hours without so much<br/>
&gt; as a hint of a challenge.  He left and was replaced by a level 50 wizard<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; we all died the next lord spawn and 2 tries later we still couldn&#39;t retake<br/>
&gt; the room...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After that experience, I got a new-found respect for the awesome power of<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; necro and will take one in my group in a heart beat.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing to keep in mind is grouping vs solo.  It is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my belief that verant doesn&#39;t really care about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; solo&#39;ing and they&#39;re just fine with necros being<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ridiculously overpowered for solo.  In a group a necro<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has some very good utility with their recent spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; additions but prior to that their dot&#39;s caused many a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem, dot bugs, stacking, etc.  I do think necros<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are a good but not overpowered group memeber.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s not exactly what I said.  I wasn&#39;t commenting<br/>
&gt; &gt; specifically on their solo capability.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Despite all the cries of nerf from necros, necros are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; still so overpowered compared to the other classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that a single necro can do things that require several<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; L50s of other classes.  It hasn&#39;t been fixed yet, so<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One necro is better than a group of 2-3 L50s (maybe more,<br/>
&gt; &gt; depending on class makeup).  You&#39;d have to be a fool not to<br/>
&gt; &gt; want one in your group.  Yes their DoTs don&#39;t get to last<br/>
&gt; &gt; their full duration if you kill stuff quickly, but the DoT(s)<br/>
&gt; &gt; they do manage to put on do about as much damage as 1-3 tanks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Their pet does about that much too.  I could see passing up<br/>
&gt; &gt; necros for if someone else (especially a buffer or healer)<br/>
&gt; &gt; were available, but if there&#39;s an empty slot and a necro comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; a-looking, they&#39;re in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you look at the formulas I whipped up for the seven-string<br/>
&gt; &gt; lute comparison, you&#39;ll see that the two primary factors in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fight are damage rate, and survival time (rate of damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; taken).  Any class who can solo well will have a very good<br/>
&gt; &gt; ratio of these two.  When you group, you add your damage rate<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the group&#39;s, while your survival time is usurped by those<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the best values (tanks, pets).  Neither of these<br/>
&gt; &gt; dramatically make the necro any weaker in groups.  Their<br/>
&gt; &gt; primary grouped handicap is that they take a while for their<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage rate to &quot;ramp up&quot; and the group often ends up killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff before they hit their max.  Still, it can&#39;t take *that*<br/>
&gt; &gt; long to ramp up or else they&#39;d need to have a large survival<br/>
&gt; &gt; time in order to solo, in which case they would be able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; supplant the role of tank.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In other words, &quot;great solo, poor grouped&quot; is a contradiction.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The worst you can get is &quot;great solo, ok grouped.&quot;<br/>
