<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-329473103">When I got DDD, I ran to shady and maxxed my brass.  Then I tried using it<br/>
some (DDD) and like all &#39;immature&#39; songs (ones you just got cuz u just<br/>
leveled) it was not the uber song I was expecting.  And then I pretty much<br/>
went back to my old standards.  And in the course of things, my brass skills<br/>
- although listed as &#39;master&#39; in my stats - fell behind my levels.  I was<br/>
wondering why screetch with horn was so crappy and it dawned on me that like<br/>
my 1HS, 1HB & Piercing, I need to max brass every level or so to keep it<br/>
maxed.  My singing and string and percussion get maxed in my normal<br/>
fighting, etc. I prolly have slacked on wind as I don&#39;t invis much any more<br/>
- at least not like I used to.<br/>
<br/>
So two points:  Yes - lower level songs seem to get stronger as you go up -<br/>
even to me at 36.  And max those skills every level - brass was one I let<br/>
slip and that&#39;s prolly why some brass stuff seemed so crappy when I tried<br/>
it. (A brass song with crappy brass skill obviously gets resisted more that<br/>
a string song with good string skill - duh!  And the CoD being more &#39;mature&#39;<br/>
than DDD adds to situation.)<br/>

p.s. so the jig song saved you about 30 seconds over the course of 5 minutes<br/>
of med time.  And then you waited another 13 minutes for the spawn.  But you<br/>
were ready just in case!  But if it makes em feel good and you don&#39;t have<br/>
the level 32 song - do it!<br/>

		In my camping of the Icy Greaves last week, and last night&#39;s<br/>
grouping in Kith, taking out high-level undead (the lowest thing con&#39;d gold<br/>
to me at 28) I have noticed that although DDD may be more powerful, CoD will<br/>
be resisited by higher level creatures MUCH less often.  About the only<br/>
things that resisted it were red cons that were upper 30&#39;s-ish to maybe 40.<br/>
Don&#39;t take my word for it, try it yourself and see ;o)</div>
