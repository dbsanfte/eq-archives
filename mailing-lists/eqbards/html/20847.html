you don&#39;t have a problem at all. here&#39;s how you do it...<br/>
(you can find a decent map at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqmaps.com/m/kaesora2.gif)">http://www.eqmaps.com/m/kaesora2.gif)</a><br/>
<br/>
Party<br/>
-----<br/>
Druid<br/>
Enchanter<br/>
Warrior<br/>
Ranger<br/>
You<br/>
Shaman<br/>
<br/>
If possible, I would grab a cleric instead of the shaman, but a shaman<br/>
should suffice. This party is almost identical to my regular party (we had a<br/>
rogue instead of a ranger and a cleric instead of a shaman) and we had no<br/>
trouble clearing all the way from the library to xalgoz when we were 35-40,<br/>
so you should have no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Zone into Kaesora. Head down the ramp and kill the roamer if he&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
Take a left and lev down to the next level. (map location A) I suggest bard<br/>
lev because levitated casters are interupted much more often.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, usually people head out to the right here and clear the spider room,<br/>
then continue down and around to the library, but that isn&#39;t the best way to<br/>
go. Instead, you should open the door directly across from you and levitate<br/>
down. (map location E) This will drop you in a dead end passage that is<br/>
right off of the loom room (which is right before the tunnel to the reaver)<br/>
<br/>
There is usually one mob waiting for you when you float down. Stay at the<br/>
bottom of the pit for the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Now have the warrior head into the loom room and pull one by one. If he<br/>
inches forward slowly, he should be able to get singles without too much<br/>
trouble. Worse case scenario will be 3 mobs. I trust you all know how to<br/>
work with an enchanter. Don&#39;t worry about snaring the skeletons, but make<br/>
sure you snare all ghosts. Also keep in mind that warders are clerics and<br/>
should be your primary target.<br/>
<br/>
After clearing the loom room (map location 4) have your warrior pull the<br/>
mobs in the tunnel before the reaver (map location F) then the reaver room<br/>
itself. (map location 5)<br/>
<br/>
To continue crawling, head just past the loom room into the tunnel where the<br/>
cross roads are. (just below room 4 on the map) All pulling to the back of<br/>
the library is done to here, so that wandering warders will be out of range<br/>
to heal the mobs you are killing.<br/>
<br/>
Have the warrior pull the back of the library. Once all mobs in the back are<br/>
killed, we usually move to the spot labeled 3 on the map and pull the<br/>
library.<br/>
<br/>
Kaesora is a great dungeon for you. The exp is unbeatable and the loot is<br/>
solid. (spirit tomes go for 3.5 k on my server, why I don&#39;t know.)<br/>

<br/>
I am right before the Ravager or something&#39;s room.  It is a room behind the<br/>
library, down a small tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
A typical group would be lvls 35-40 druid, enchanter, ranger, warrior.<br/>
Possibly another ranger, druid, enchanter or shaman.  We have a serious lack<br/>
of diversity in our guild.  Of the main group, there is one person with no<br/>
human blood I think.  (High elf enchanter)  All the rest are human, half<br/>
elf, barbarian or Erudite.  We have one wiz above 30 and no necros or<br/>
mages...<br/>
