<div id="ygrps-yiv-495839747">Yes, this is actually light enough to move with.  Just as a marker, I have on <br/>
several occasions made a High Keep/RV/Commons/NRo/Freeport run with six <br/>
backpacks full of armor (I&#39;m a smith, plus I have to get rid of all that HK <br/>
bronze somehow, too), and even with an encumbrance of around 230 (str 96) I can <br/>
still run noticeably faster than normals (with Selo&#39;s and a drum).  When I was <br/>
younger and tailoring (before people realized that ruined pelts were worth <br/>
something) I would visit all of the inns in Commons and fill eight backpacks <br/>
with them.  Even at encumbrances of near 300 I could still move (but only with <br/>
Selo&#39;s active).<br/>
<br/>
Just for amusement, convert all of your plat to copper sometime when you&#39;re at <br/>
the bank and check out your encumbrance.  24000/96, agility 1.  hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Heheh - dearest sister - I don&#39;t care if you twist chant, anthem, warsong<br/>
&gt; &gt; and selo&#39;s  - with 3210gp you would NOT be able to walk to the door much<br/>
&gt; &gt; less run to somewhere in Rathe Mts - not even with a MM drum.  But I am sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone will try! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bah, it&#39;s about 81 pounds.  You can run with it just fine.<br/>
&gt; With Accelerando and a drum, you&#39;ll probably still be faster<br/>
&gt; than SoW unencumbered (with a MM drum you definitely will be).<br/>
