<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783502720">I have a fairly easy and painless solution.  Go to Lesser Faydark and hunt<br/>
the generic bandit camp.  You are already familiar with their tactics and I<br/>
could solo most of them at 11th and I only wear leather.  If can&#39;t solo them<br/>
a partner shouldn&#39;t be hard to find and there isn&#39;t much dangerous walkin<br/>
about.  You&#39;ll also be close to the best source for small banded if you<br/>
want, Greater faydark.  I can make 20pp there in about 4hrs if its not too<br/>
crowded.  Good luck!<br/>
