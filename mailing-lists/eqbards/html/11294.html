1) Faerie Dust. You need to talk to Princess Joleena of the fairies(she&#39;s in <br/>
Lesser Faydark in the center of the Fairy Camp near a Gnome Clockwork) about <br/>
this. Asking her about it reveals that one of her wings was stolen by a bald <br/>
person who smelled of rust and refuse. She asks you to bring her wing back <br/>
and she&#39;ll give you the Fairy Dust. In Ak&#39;Anon across from the Necro Guild <br/>
there is a Gnome named Sanfyrd Featherhead. If you ask him where Princess <br/>
Joleena&#39;s wing is, he will tell you that you can&#39;t have it because he read <br/>
that it will make his hair grow back. He also mentions that he has no <br/>
[friends]. Befriend him by saying, &quot;I&#39;m your friend&quot; at which point he <br/>
exclaims that you are &quot;just saying that to get my feather, if you are really <br/>
my friend you would help me get some hair tonic.&quot; Converse with him further <br/>
and he will give you a 10 slot crate to fill with hair tonics. Then go to <br/>
West Freeport and visit a Gnome Merchant in a tent outside the West Gate by <br/>
the name of Ping Fuzzlecutter. Ping sells the tonics you need, so just buy <br/>
ten and combine them(they are not called hair tonics, there is some other <br/>
wierd name for the tonics). Take the new box(no longer a container) back to <br/>
Sanfyrd Featherhead and he will ask one more favor beforegiving you the <br/>
wing. He will give you his tattered toupee&#39; and ask that you get it fixed by <br/>
the same man who sold him the tonic. So once again go to West Freeport to <br/>
talk to Ping Fuzzlecutter again. You need to ask Ping, &quot;can you repair a <br/>
toupee?&quot;(you must say &quot;repair&quot; rather than fix or he won&#39;t respond). Ping <br/>
will go into the history of his wig, &quot;The Mane Attraction&quot; and tell you that <br/>
he can still fix it because it is under warranty. But in order to fix it you <br/>
need to fetch him two clumps of hair from a Hulking Gorilla(lvl 25 or so <br/>
gorillas in the Cazic-Thule throne room) and a lock of the golden tresses <br/>
from a &quot;certain mermaid&quot;. This certain mermaid is a &quot;golden haired mermaid&quot; <br/>
(thats the exact name of the npc) that resides in Kedge Keep. You will <br/>
absolutely need at least two well balanced 40+ groups to safely do this in <br/>
Kedge. Once you retrieve the mermaid hair, go back to West Freeport and give <br/>
Ping the 2 clumps of Gorilla Hair, the Golden Locke, and the Wig and you <br/>
will get the Mane Attraction.<br/>
