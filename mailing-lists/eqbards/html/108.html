<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376266107">I have been listening to both sides in this argument(?) and would like to<br/>
put in my two coppers...<br/>
<br/>
	First, on the issue of the 10 pp. Actually, they only require 1pp and the<br/>
rest to be paid as can before a initiate reaches the 10 level. That is a<br/>
long period in Norrath time. For I my self and not the most skilled of<br/>
hunters but can earn about 1pp to 1pp 5 gp a Notathian day in the east<br/>
commons just outside the city of Freeport. This is by hunting the Deathfist<br/>
Pawn/Orc&#39;s (which I mention one should not take lightly, for there are<br/>
places in Norrath that this activity can make one a kill on site. I learned<br/>
this the hard way at the hands of an Dark-Elf and his pet skeleton. Never<br/>
underestimate the power of the faction system) Wolfs, Skeletons (Who&#39;s<br/>
rusted weapons can bring about 1gp each), Bears, Fire Beatles, and<br/>
spiderlings (nonpoisonous). Also one can make about 5-7gp a Norrathian day<br/>
just outside the gates of Freeport hunting the unlimited and massive vermin<br/>
that romp there (Stomping rats, bats, and snakes- oh my!!!). Not a lot of<br/>
experience but it is money none the less. So the dues is not that great<br/>
problem I would surmise. My expenses are about 2-3gp for food, water, and<br/>
throwing Knives (very useful for drawing away creators from a croup to<br/>
dispatch them one at a time or if you are just too lazy to walk over and<br/>
wack&#39;em).<br/>
<br/>
	Second, the group does give to its members. I do not know what others<br/>
guilds are like and will not even conjecture for not wanting to unjustly<br/>
slander. But this group have stated how they help those that belong to their<br/>
fold. and it sounds very reasonable. I can not conjecture on the<br/>
personalities of the members having not met any, nor belonging to the group<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
	So in closing I would mention that it so far sounds to me like their<br/>
request are not that out of the realm of the feasible. Personally I am<br/>
tempted to join also, but I have not met any of the participants, and place<br/>
more on the personal actions/demeanor of people then any group ideal for the<br/>
true measure of any body is found in it members for people can try to live<br/>
up to any lofty goals they profess, it is their actions that show their true<br/>
direction. I am from the Show me part of Norrath (this ideal has gotten my<br/>
face slapped in many a tavern but that is another story we best not get into<br/>
here :) ). So I would best suggest that people just check out their<br/>
postings, talk to members, non-members, and even those with an axe to grind.<br/>
for to find the middle best to know where the outer most edges are. for in<br/>
the middle you will find the truth. As any good trader knows, if you can<br/>
live with the down side of a deal there is no reason not to go though with<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
	Another reason I may not be able to join, for you see a SnowLynx among<br/>
SeaBirds could, how you say,... Be a bit, messy. :)<br/>
<br/>
	But this is only a Bards ramblings, and is only worth no more than the<br/>
electrodes it is stored with...<br/>
<br/>
	SnowLynx-Gentleman Bard of Freeport...</div>
