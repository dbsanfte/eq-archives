  My comment stands.  However, I apologize for the seemingly lack of <br/>
  respect, but you&#39;ve got to realize I&#39;ve played this game <br/>
  as a bard longer than you have -- and I hear all the L20 bards<br/>
  complaining because the Lambent quests are too hard.  The fact <br/>
  that they think they should get Lambent because they are something<br/>
  special, irritates me.  I worked really hard for my armor.  <br/>
<br/>
  My point was I wish all bards had to work for their armor, cause<br/>
  it doesn&#39;t get any better until level 46.  I dont whine that I<br/>
  cannot get the Plane armor yet, so I&#39;m working as hard as I<br/>
  can to become of level to travel and earn it.<br/>
<br/>
  Plus, I never called you a twink.  You put those words in my mouth<br/>
  Mr. Level 22 Bard hehe.  So what does a L22 bard wear nowadays?<br/>
<br/>
  You posted to this list looking for advice, and I gave it to you.<br/>
  I&#39;m sorry it wasn&#39;t what you wanted to hear.  If you want Lambent<br/>
  armor, you need to take some risks and quest for it, or pay the<br/>
  piper.  I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.<br/>
