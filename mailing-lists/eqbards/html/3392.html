weaving/juggling/mixing/cycling :-) Accelerando with the<br/>
ultravision song that if you start a song so that its effect<br/>
kicks in the same instant it&#39;s previous pulse ends, the<br/>
ending effect takes precedence.  i.e. I&#39;d hit Accel, then the<br/>
other song, then Accel again.  I got the pulse, the &quot;feet move<br/>
faster&quot; message followed immediately by the &quot;slow down&quot;<br/>
message, and I was moving at normal running speed despite that<br/>
I was still singing Accel.<br/>

Has anyone else noticed that if someone in your party goes<br/>
linkdead while you&#39;re playing the invisibility song, they<br/>
sometimes come back permanently invisible (until they camp or<br/>
zone).  Dunno if it affects mobs, but it definitely affects<br/>
other players.  Casting, attacking, etc. did not break it.<br/>
