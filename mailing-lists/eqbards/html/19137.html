I don&#39;t doubt that he&#39;s a nice guy and knows his own class inside out and I<br/>
have a lot of respect for him for putting up with the flak from disgruntled<br/>
players daily.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m with Galtin on this one.  Before tossing some ideas into the<br/>
lion&#39;s den, he should have checked with the spell gurus or at least someone<br/>
in-house that plays a Bard. It sounds like he even spoke with GZ about it.<br/>
<br/>
If he did check, it&#39;s safe to assume the spell guys don&#39;t know how some Bard<br/>
songs interact with each other and/or they don&#39;t have a Bard of sufficient<br/>
level in-house to verify that twisting Invis with anything else doesn&#39;t<br/>
work.<br/>
