&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know either.  I broke a level last night and several skills were<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; &gt; up and I didn&#39;t see any difference in the messages being printed.  &quot;You<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; become better at percussion and now pass other players even more quickly<br/>
using<br/>
&gt; &gt; Selo&#39;s Accelerando (84).&quot;  I expected (84/200) or something.  So I<br/>
switched to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Skills screen hoping that instead of &quot;Feeble&quot; my fishing would be<br/>
shown as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Feeble 12/200&quot;, but nope...  Anyone know where they hid the one thing<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they *did* document?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Typically, the stuff they do document doesn&#39;t often work. Such as the<br/>
&gt; invisibility flashing before it wears off as they documented in the last<br/>
&gt; patch. Perhaps that&#39;s the case here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I did notice something with my shaman.  I maxed alteration for<br/>
level 11 at 60, then a few minutes later, I got &quot;you have become better at<br/>
alteration (60)&quot; again.<br/>
<br/>
At least, I&#39;m pretty sure that actually happened, I was tired :) </span></blockquote></div>
