<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176036007">As a bard, I have been working on some ballads to perform for others.  This<br/>
si my latest one that I thought I would share with the group.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
if you use it. I think part of a Bard&#39;s job is to spread the works of others<br/>
as well as create works of their own.  I do that myself, and I try to give<br/>
credit to the original poet if I know who it is.  Anyway, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the deep, dark wood<br/>
Of eerie Kithicor<br/>
See the bixies flit about<br/>
Hear the horrible kodiak roar<br/>
<br/>
In the deep, dark wood<br/>
Of eerie Kithicor<br/>
The halflings play in their cool glen<br/>
Not far from Highhold Pass´┐¢s door<br/>
<br/>
In the deep, dark wood<br/>
Of eerie Kithicor<br/>
Settlers proud and noble died<br/>
Defending us from zombie hordes<br/>
<br/>
In the deep, dark wood<br/>
Of eerie Kithicor<br/>
Abandoned, burned and haunted homes<br/>
Remnants of the things they wore<br/>
<br/>
In the deep, dark wood<br/>
Of eerie Kithicor<br/>
An undead ghoul took my friend´┐¢s life<br/>
Now it´┐¢s time to settle the score<br/>
<br/>
In the deep, dark wood<br/>
Of eerie Kithicor</div>
