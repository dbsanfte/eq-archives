<div id="ygrps-yiv-914569137">Melodic binding also has a four tick duration.  The first tick when the song<br/>
pulses, then three more ticks after that. This applies to Chords of<br/>
Dissonance, Denon&#39;s Dissension, Denon&#39;s Discord, Chords of Cessation, and<br/>
the three new Chant series songs.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, a &#39;tick&#39; is 2.5 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
One other note, and this seems to be overlooked by a lot of bards.  The bard<br/>
DoT songs stack.  2nd, 18th, 35th, 48th, as well as the single target Chant<br/>
songs, can all be combined.  With two bards, this is a very valid tactic,<br/>
splitting the load between them, greatly amplifying the amount of damage<br/>
they do in combat.<br/>
<br/>
Experiment with and without instruments, I think you&#39;ll find that you can<br/>
live with just punching mobs instead of using sharp, heavy, or pointy<br/>
objects, letting your music do your work for you.  But, I agree, sometimes<br/>
it just feels good to wade in there and hack and slash.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the real subtle benefits of the Bard class.  Each and every<br/>
one of your songs grows more potent as you level, and never becomes truly<br/>
obsolete.  There&#39;s a situation to be found for using each and every one.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike pure casters, who generally receive an upgrade to an existing spell<br/>
every few circles, making the old spell useless.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;I was wondering, if the MOB get hit by this song then I stop<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;playing does their ac still down and still do dmg to them for another 2<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;melee or does it stop when u stop.  Any info on this would be<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;    Just like chords & hymn, discord&#39;s effect lasts for 3 rounds, so<br/>
juggle<br/>
&gt;&gt; in two more songs :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any idea if this is also the case with Binding (L20)?  None of<br/>
&gt;my friends are willing to duel me to find out...<br/>
