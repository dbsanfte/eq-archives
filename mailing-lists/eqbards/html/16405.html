<div id="ygrps-yiv-610380304">Why aren&#39;t you guys using Melodic Binding and Chords of Cessation and then<br/>
Chaining when they&#39;re about to run?  Don&#39;t like the AE?  Binding has an AC<br/>
drop and the same speed reduction as Chains, while Chords (lvl 48) has a<br/>
friggin&#39; DoT built in.  I&#39;ve seen countless mobs die to the Chords DoT since<br/>
I&#39;ve been level 48 - &quot;A mob has died&quot;.  In typical non-Planer melee fighting<br/>
at level 48 I have the current songs memmed:<br/>
<br/>
1- Berserker<br/>
2- Niv&#39;s (will switch for +MR as necessary)<br/>
3- Chords of Cessation<br/>
4- Chains<br/>
5- Selo&#39;s (switches out in dungeons)<br/>
6- Pixie Strike (I love this song so much)<br/>
7- Hymn<br/>
8- Clarity<br/>
<br/>
Songs 1,2,3 are the ones that I typically sing in combat.  When mob&#39;s health<br/>
gets low I switch to 1,2,4 if necessary.  If AE is bad for the<br/>
mobs/location, or an enchanter is mezzing and Chord&#39;s DoT would be a bad<br/>
thing, I will use 1,2,4 exclusively or simply swap in something for Chords<br/>
as appropriate.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Very true.  The only reason I defer runner-stoppage to snare is<br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; fire and forget.  If one gets away though I am the stopper<br/>
&gt; because I can run<br/>
&gt; &gt; while &quot;casting&quot; and keep the sucker in sight.  I can also stop<br/>
&gt; them at a LOT<br/>
&gt; &gt; greater life than a snare can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree it&#39;s better for stopping runners, but you shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; defer entirely unless you have a shaman or enchanter doing<br/>
&gt; speed debuffs.  Most rangers and druids have gotten a bit lazy<br/>
&gt; with snare and just snare at the beginning of a fight.  Unless<br/>
&gt; the mob is high red (i.e. you&#39;ll have a hard time getting<br/>
&gt; Chain or snare to stick), I&#39;d recommend Chaining for a good<br/>
&gt; portion of the fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Talk it through with the snarer and try it out - some mobs die<br/>
&gt; so quickly it&#39;s not worth it, others you can Chain only to<br/>
&gt; about half hp before stopping in order to give the snarer<br/>
&gt; enough time to snare.  Others have so many hp you can Chain<br/>
&gt; almost until they&#39;re about to run, and the snarer will still<br/>
&gt; have enough time to snare.  Once I figured out when I needed<br/>
&gt; to stop Chaining, I&#39;d give a quick &quot;Chain off&quot; message in<br/>
&gt; groupsay, and the ranger would have enough time for 3-4<br/>
&gt; attempts at snare.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Remember, a 30%-40% speed debuff is not just equivalent to<br/>
&gt; increasing your attack speed by 30%-40%, it also means<br/>
&gt; regeneration/Hymn and meditation/Clarity are 30%-40% more<br/>
&gt; effective, casters have 30%-40% more time to cast without<br/>
&gt; being interrupted, and you have 30%-40% more time to react to<br/>
&gt; changing combat situations.<br/>
