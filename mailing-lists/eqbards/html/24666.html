<div id="ygrps-yiv-216920146"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Sounds like you are in a great guilds where people work <br/>

&gt; very common (especially from what I&#39;ve seen on Xegony).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bah! Let me know when you want to come on a DC raid, Slyde, you might <br/>
be surprised with what you see. (Maybe this is why DC was <br/>
tagged &quot;Friendliest Uber Guild on Xegony&quot; -- not that I would <br/>
consider us &quot;Uber&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
The topic of loot has come up a few time (well, more than most of us <br/>
would like,) and here is our simplified loot rules.<br/>
<br/>
#1) Need before greed -- an item must be one you will use a majority <br/>
of the time on your main character. If you say it will, your word it <br/>
taken (and yes, we have a druid with a FBSS. *Smiles*)<br/>
<br/>
#2) Some areas have been flagged &quot;God Loot&quot; -- Hate floor 2, Dragons, <br/>
VS, etc... if there are multiple characters who want in on an item <br/>
like this, only characters 54+ are considered, if there are no 54+, <br/>
then 53 and below are in on the lotto. THIS IS ONLY FOR &quot;GOD LOOT&quot;. <br/>
Please note, each class in encouraged to come up with their own <br/>
system for items that are class specific. For example, there are only <br/>
4 primary bards in DC, we just talk things over when dropped, the <br/>
druids often know who gets the next item before then raid even <br/>
starts, etc...<br/>
<br/>
#3) DC has no time limit on raid loot -- I once logged into Hate and <br/>
before I could join up with the others, I had already won a diamond <br/>
(or blue diamond).<br/>
<br/>
#4) The guild maintains a &quot;guild bag&quot; (ok, this is a symbolic bag -- <br/>
the items actually reside on many different guild characters) of <br/>
items (equipment, quest gems, spells, etc...) no one currently <br/>
wants/needs. You are free to take an item out of the bag if you want <br/>
it, and are encouraged to put things into it. If the bag accumulates <br/>
too much stuff, bag items are traded for better items, sold to fund <br/>
raid stones (or coffins *Smiles*). The guild bag is also used each <br/>
Christmas when Saanta Claws (our guild Ogre in Rubicite) gives out <br/>
items to guild/newbies/friendly people over a period of a few weeks <br/>
(we are actually thinking about moving this to two times a year.)<br/>
<br/>
#5) When you no longer need a guild item, you can either trade it for <br/>
a better item (still guild), pass it to another guild member, or put <br/>
it in the guild bag. For example, I was using a melod <br/>
trunch/symphonic sabre combo, and another main Bard leveled to 45. <br/>
Since he was using two yaks, I passed my sabre to him, and started <br/>
using a guild yak on my offhand. We then found another saber on a <br/>
Char raid, which was given to me. A couple of weeks ago, we had a <br/>
level 51 bard join who had poor weapons... I once again passed on my <br/>
saber (although I now use Renux&#39;s sword in my offhand.)<br/>
<br/>
#6) If there is ANY question on who is in on a lotto, the raid leader <br/>
makes a decision... and that is final.<br/>
<br/>
#7) Any non-DC on a DC raid is treated as though they are DC -- no <br/>
time limits, 54+ rule, everything... Sure, the guild often loses nice <br/>
items, but we have a lot of friends, and, well, this game (to me) is <br/>
not about items.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am pretty sure these rules would not work for a lot of guilds, but <br/>
since we try to keep a &quot;family&quot; environment, and have a lot of trust <br/>
in our (very fair) raid leaders, it seems to work for us. (And, yes, <br/>
we have lost members over loot issues -- just gonna happen.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
