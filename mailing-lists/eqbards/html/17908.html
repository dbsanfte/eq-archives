<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123205785">I don&#39;t know about banded being unprofitable...Shamans<br/>
need it for totemic armor and there are usually a few<br/>
people making it, I think it&#39;s rare because the skill<br/>
required to make the stuff takes a long time to build.<br/>
<br/>
I got most of my bronze (just upgraded) from a 43rd<br/>
lvl magician camping Einhorst in the Barb village in<br/>
WK.<br/>
<br/>
But up until this week I had a full set of banded.  <br/>
<br/>
WK might be a good place to buy bronze cheap since<br/>
it&#39;s so heavy and Einhorst apparently drops quite a<br/>
bit of it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Banded armour (and what level should we upgrade to<br/>
&gt; bronze)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dragoon Dirk: 40P<br/>
&gt; Banded Armor is usually less than 1P per AC.  Bronze<br/>
&gt; is normally 1+ a<br/>
&gt; bit per AC.<br/>
&gt; If you can carry it, skip banded and go right to<br/>
&gt; bronze.  Its cheap<br/>
&gt; enough now, and no one makes banded anymore (since<br/>
&gt; its so unprofitable)<br/>
