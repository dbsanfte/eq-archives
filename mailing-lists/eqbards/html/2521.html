<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993674059">Nah, I&#39;m playing a woodelf as well.  It usually does 7pts for me.  Maybe it<br/>
was tweaked since you first got it.  BTW, I love wood elves too much to play<br/>
any other race unless forced to (my next chrt is an enchanter, and I don&#39;t<br/>
think wood elf is an option). I just love having forage & hide at lvl 1. :)<br/>

&gt; And Bellow goes up a point in damage every other level or so.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curioius though why you&#39;re finding it does 7 points when<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve just gotten it.  If I recall correctly, it only did 5<br/>
&gt; points max when I got it.  Maybe wood elves have smaller<br/>
&gt; lungs? </span></blockquote></div>
