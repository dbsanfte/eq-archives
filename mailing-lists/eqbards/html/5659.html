&gt; &gt;Almost every time I think something saw through my<br/>

&gt; &gt;I was attacked is &quot;you become visible.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Hrm - there has always been some error with the cause and effect timing.<br/>
&gt; Notice how whenever you are bashed, your song ends *before* the monster<br/>
&gt; bashes you?  Methinks that they hit you, removing the invisibility.  Now<br/>
&gt; how they saw you - well, who knows?<br/>

through a dozen times before while invisible could suddenly<br/>
see me, I will go with the invisibility blinking off as the<br/>
explanation. :-)<br/>
