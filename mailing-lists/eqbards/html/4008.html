<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446651733">It seems to me that most people abandon the tentacle whip at a relatively<br/>
early point in the game due to the reasons that you list below...it is a<br/>
nice starter weapon, but becomes useless later due to the damage/proc ratio.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone of a higher level have any stats on using the Tentacle Whip?  I<br/>
think it is likely that the frequency an item procs is affects by your<br/>
Dexterity, and in some cases by your level as well.  Would the whip be more<br/>
effective if at, say, level 25 it proc&#39;d 80% of the time compared with the<br/>
20% (or whatever) it does at lower levels?<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea about this, just wondering...I have never even held a<br/>
tentacle whip letalone snap it at someone, so this is just my curiosity.<br/>

By the way...if I die 3 times in one night at Unrest again I am going to get<br/>
a little frustrated :-(  I can&#39;t reiterate how important a good, calm,<br/>
coordinated group is for ones health...especially we bards.  A spastic group<br/>
will only get you killed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; How would a combination of a tentacle whip and a Polished <br/>
&gt; Granite Tomahawk<br/>
&gt; &gt; be?  I have both, and was planning on using them at level <br/>
&gt; 17 for dual wield.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which shoud be the primary weapon, or is there a better <br/>
&gt; combo?  I also have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a Dragoon Dirk.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks<br/>

&gt; The tentacle whip is a good starter magical weapon, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; about it.  I suppose if you were grouped with a druid who<br/>
&gt; could put a damage shield on you, and you played Hymn during<br/>
&gt; your battles, you could use the whip&#39;s lifetap effect to<br/>
&gt; extend combat long enough that the monster mostly kills itself<br/>
&gt; trying to hurt you.  But the frequency with which it procs is<br/>
&gt; not great enough to offset the low damage ratio.<br/>
