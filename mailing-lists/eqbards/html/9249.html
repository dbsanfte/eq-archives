Question: I just got Pixie strike and was looking forward mostly to its<br/>
spell interupting ability, which seems to work really well. I being 28th now<br/>
grouped with a 40th bard who was lookign for the mudwater rune. He stated he<br/>
keeps Lucid lull or Lament armed for spell interuption. Thats the question<br/>
does the target or area lull songs interupt spells extremely well.<br/>

&gt;Yep I have encountered this.  Generally the people who do this have<br/>
&gt;significantly more down time than I do (mine is nearly zero) so I usually<br/>
&gt;just wander off to somewhere else immediately.  I can then come back a<br/>
&gt;little later and voila!, the whole camp is there again and the guy looking<br/>
&gt;for the choice mob is staring at it and its buddies.  I then lament the<br/>
&gt;others, kill the choice mob and start to wander off again.  They quickly<br/>

&gt;the spawn I usually just leave to their fate and move on.  I imagine this<br/>

&gt;&gt; Lament is the best song you get other than Selo&#39;s until you are 11th<br/>
&gt;level.<br/>
&gt;&gt; It will allow you to easily solo critters characters 5 levels higher than<br/>
&gt;&gt; you just look at because they can&#39;t take 3 at once.  It allowed me to sol<br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;&gt; the bandit camp in Lesser Faydark 4 levels before anyone else I ever saw<br/>
&gt;&gt; there.  No one else could handle the multiple spawns they would have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; face, but I could easily pull one out at a time and make boocou plat off<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Be forewarned, after you break a camp using Lament and have<br/>
&gt;spaced the spawns out, other people will arrive and demand<br/>
&gt;that you share with them.  Normally I don&#39;t have a problem<br/>
&gt;with this, but lately Lower Guk seems to be crawling with<br/>
&gt;soloers who run in while you&#39;re resting and pick off the prize<br/>
&gt;mobs.<br/>
