&gt; I have mostly banded, plus bronze pants, gauntlets, and helm.  The<br/>
&gt; Dwarven tunic blends well enough with the tunic.  But, I really hate<br/>
&gt; the look of the bronze helm on wood elf females.  It totally covers my<br/>
&gt; face.  The banded has a nice egyptian look, but the bronze looks like<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wearing a small trash can on my head.  I may just give up the<br/>
&gt; extra AC and get a banded helm instead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was really the dwarven tunic/bronze sleeves that I couldn&#39;t take (wood<br/>
elf also).  The pants could use to be replaced also.  I&#39;ve just got to find<br/>
someone selling banded.  <br/>
<br/>
I lucked out with the hat.  The guildmate donating the bronze hated bronze<br/>
helms on wood elves soooo much she gave me a lumberjacks cap.  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
what it looks like other than it doesn&#39;t quite show from the front (like the<br/>
patchwork it replaced).  Nice stats though.<br/>
