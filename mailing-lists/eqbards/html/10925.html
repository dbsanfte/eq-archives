<div id="ygrps-yiv-28670314">Oh Sylly, sometimes you just make me want to start all over on Innoruuk.<br/>
Sounds like you and I are more alike than not alike.  Usually I can read<br/>
bard posts all day at work in between compiles and it doesn&#39;t bother me, but<br/>
you Harm and Kae can really get me in the mood to play EQ, although Kae for<br/>
totally different reasons.  Speaking of which, has anyone heard from<br/>
John(tm) lately?  Must be on vacation.<br/>

IMHO - you are playing it either &quot;for the wrong reasons&quot; or the &quot;wrong way&quot;<br/>
or both.  And when I say wrong - I mean wrong for you - because you let<br/>
things &quot;get to you.&quot; All these &quot;you&#39;s&quot; being the generic &quot;you&quot; not a<br/>
personal attack. Ok &lt;g&gt; ?<br/>
<br/>
I have over 80 days played (on Sylly alone) and am level 37 and I do not<br/>
play any other chars - seriously.  I hate getting XP.  I hate Highkeep,<br/>
Ogguk, KFC (although it got better with the Penthouse levels).  XP is<br/>
boring, boring, boring.  I hate Verant when they nerf my trade skills and<br/>
make it so I cant ever afford to earn PP.  I love meeting some young ranger<br/>
who is totally lost - level 10 and has a lion chasing him across East<br/>
Karana.  Now there is an adventure waiting to happen!  I&#39;ll decline an<br/>
invote to an Ogguk guard party to run him to Surefall Glade.<br/>
<br/>
I do LOVE all of the people and friends I have met in my adventures!  I play<br/>
this game for them! <br/>
<br/>
If I see someone fully twinked - it does not bother me in the least.  I know<br/>
a lot more about what its like as you go higher up.  I run out of bank room<br/>
- yes I keep meaning to start gnome war and give her a full set of bronze ;p<br/>
I got junk not worth selling but so far out of the reach of &#39;normal levels&#39;<br/>
it&#39;s a twink to pass out. I have k&#39;s of pp and nothing to buy! Who cares<br/>
that some one has started a twink?  Feel good about the stuff you have<br/>
earned.  When that twink hits mid 20&#39;s he will have to endure the same<br/>
number of hours in HK and not even get the small re-compense of feeling good<br/>
about the loot.  At least there is stuff of value for you to go get.  <br/>
<br/>
Decide that you either care about the loot and xp or you care about the<br/>
people and the adventures.  Then make your choice.  Camp, powergame, kill<br/>
guards, spend endless hours on easy kills, easy kills and more easy kills.<br/>
/r bz killing darter<br/>
<br/>
Or adventure and make some friends.  If you don&#39;t like playing for the<br/>
people part why bother with a massive multi-player - get a box game and get<br/>
your loots from 100% NPC&#39;s - no Twinked wood elfs, no KS wizzies, no KS<br/>
druids kiting, no cute little gnomes to chat with.  That&#39;s a totally<br/>
different game.<br/>
<br/>
EverQuest and Norrath is a wild and crazy place!  Not everything is &quot;right&quot;<br/>
nor fits to everyone&#39;s personal vision of &quot;how things should be&quot; but there<br/>
are lots and lots of people playing the game and lots and lots of adventures<br/>
to be had.  Forget about twinking - its just someone with too much money and<br/>
nowhere to store their toys. The joy and value of the game is in people and<br/>
adventures.  Not camping XP.  <br/>
<br/>
I would sure hate to see you go.  I think you are a really great Bard.  And<br/>
to see you quit just cause you see some twink that has an attitude - would<br/>
sadden me greatly.  So, hang in there and have some great adventures!<br/>
<br/>
Or start a new bard on Innoruuk and Harm and I will twink you to the max!!!<br/>

		I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of<br/>
&#39;played&#39; time<br/>
		and I just hit level 36. <br/>
<br/>
		I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game<br/>
that makes me<br/>
		feel this way.<br/>
