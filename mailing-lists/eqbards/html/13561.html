<div id="ygrps-yiv-60849202">Naeeldar, there are quite a number of places that high levels tend to forget<br/>
about.  At later levels having grown up in Sol B and Lower Guk from 35-45<br/>
you get into sort of a mindset of pull-kill, pull-kill, pull-kill.  Higher<br/>
level players sometimes don&#39;t use their imaginations about things to do!<br/>
Here are some suggestions of interesting things for high levels to do for<br/>
experience:<br/>
<br/>
Kedge Keep.  I&#39;m not sure if 50s get great exp there, but 40-48s sure do.<br/>
Definitely a fun place.<br/>
<br/>
Ocean Of Tears.  The Seafury Cyclops in OOT that give exp to 50s and spawn<br/>
as fast as Moss Snakes.  There&#39;s the Allizewsaur, a level 50 &quot;dinosaur&quot;<br/>
roaming an island there.  He spawns pretty quickly and is pretty tough to<br/>
take down - so hard in fact a level 50 necro with a pet actually uses more<br/>
than half mana to do it.  Now THAT&#39;S tough.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Guards in Neriak, Oggok and Grobb.  Heck for that matter if you don&#39;t care<br/>
about faction there are guards everywhere.  You want a thrill?  Go set up<br/>
camp down deep inside the town of Oggok and pull Bouncers.  It&#39;s fun and<br/>
challenging.  Heck Harmonic hit 50 killing Bouncers.  Invis your way into<br/>
Neriak&#39;s Third Gate and pull gaurds.  Makes you feel like a kid again!<br/>
<br/>
Castle Mistmoore.  There are mobs in there that give experience to 50s.<br/>
<br/>
Brownie Guards in Lesser Fay.  They were red to me last time I saw &#39;em at<br/>
41.  I&#39;d be pretty surprised if 50s didn&#39;t get exp there.<br/>
<br/>
Paw has been tweaked again to be just slightly easier.  Do 45-50s get exp<br/>
there?  Little to none probably, but good 40-45 I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, don&#39;t forget some of the other places.  I too get into a mindset of<br/>
&quot;damn, solb packed.  I&#39;ll run to lguk and check it out.&quot;  But there are<br/>
other things to do.<br/>

&gt; I know but believe me what do you low levels need a change of<br/>
&gt; pace? You have<br/>
&gt; multiple dungeons. I don&#39;t care for a change of pace all I want is to be<br/>
&gt; less crowded and they can change that with more zones. You guys<br/>
&gt; have so many<br/>
&gt; options of zone that it&#39;s not even funny but lets say for 46+ we<br/>
&gt; have the 3<br/>
&gt; planes now and sol b and guk. But wait there are people 30+ in guk and sol<br/>
&gt; b. So all we really have is 3 zones. Now for 30ish people you<br/>
&gt; have a variety<br/>
&gt; of outdoor zones, for dungeons you have permafrost, CT, Unrest, MM, Sol A,<br/>
&gt; Guk, Lower Guk, Sol B. See the problem? I play a mid level char a 50 char<br/>
&gt; and a low level char and there are no problems with the low or mid levle<br/>
&gt; chars. High level chars there is a problem though. It&#39;s not like were<br/>
&gt; complaining we need a change of pace we want something new for the hell of<br/>
&gt; it we don&#39;t but you are. Seriously what problems do you have at mid or low<br/>
&gt; levels? Not many high levels are plagued with overcrowded. Hell I love the<br/>
&gt; lower guk zone and I&#39;d be happy if they just duplicated the zone<br/>
&gt; a bunch of<br/>
&gt; times. Seriously though how about you list me a couple of problems you low<br/>
&gt; mid levels have.<br/>
