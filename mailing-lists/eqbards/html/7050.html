I do not know if the Chrysknife can be looted in Paw, however it is a RARE<br/>
drop of the Gnoll Embalmer from Lake Rathe.  His common drop is, of course,<br/>
the Skul of Jhen&#39;Tra, but I looted a chrysknife from him a couple of weeks<br/>
ago.  Of course, I&#39;ve probably killed him 3 dozen times, and that&#39;s the only<br/>
knife I&#39;ve ever seen.  I was quite surprised. :-)<br/>

A friend of mine has his heart set on getting one of these, and I can&#39;t<br/>
for the life of me (literally, on occasion) find where in Paw it comes<br/>
from.  If anyone has good, specific information on it, please email me<br/>
directly to keep offtopic discussion (mostly) off the list.<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
