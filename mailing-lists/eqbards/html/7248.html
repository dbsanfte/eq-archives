<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003929253">I did most of my guild training in Freeport.  By level 23, I knew 23 <br/>
different languages (I am not certain, but I don&#39;t think we get Thieves <br/>
Cant in the guild, I think we have to learn it elsewhere).  I have <br/>
heard that there are 24 languages in the game, but haven&#39;t confirmed <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
The languages are at the bottom of the skill list; new ones appear as you <br/>
level up.  You need to invest one point in a language to have it show up <br/>
on your skill list. Be warned, knowing that many languages makes it <br/>
really annoying to select from the language box.<br/>
<br/>
Some instructions on language training (I am not sure if this is <br/>
Bard-specific enough for this board, but, hey, what do they give us that <br/>
many languages for if not to learn them?):<br/>
<br/>
1.  It is not particularly useful to learn a language to less than <br/>
Excellent (100 skills), since you will just have to find another teacher <br/>
later anyway.  If you are learning, you should insist on Excellent (100 <br/>
skills), if you are training, you should guarantee it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Training is best as a group activity, otherwise you will spam the <br/>
world and cause bad lag, which ticks off the locals.  The trainer and <br/>
his/her trainees should form a group.<br/>
<br/>
3.  For a number of reasons (I won&#39;t bore you), train near a zone point, <br/>
in a quiet corner.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Trainers should set up a social with a /g statement on EVERY line.  <br/>
Each line gives a separate learning attempt, so maximize your button <br/>
pressing.<br/>
<br/>
5.  The social should be attached to a button.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Instruct your trainees to:  sit down, turn off group speak (so they <br/>
don&#39;t lose training notifications in all the spam), and tell them to <br/>
stand up when they believe they have stopped learning.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Play a song.  Otherwise, it is hard to count the skill increase <br/>
messages (since they don&#39;t give you a numeric value, for some annoying <br/>
reason).   <br/>
<br/>
8.  Start spamming (hitting your social button as fast as possible).<br/>
<br/>
9.  When all trainees are standing, you can stop spamming.  Instruct them <br/>
to zone and check their skill rating (the changes do not show up until <br/>
after zoning).  If anyone is not maxed, tell them to come back, and top <br/>
them off.<br/>
<br/>
This is a quite useful for occupying your time on a boat.  The boat trip <br/>
is just about the right length (a little short, but finish on the pier).<br/>
<br/>
For lower level bards in need of cash, training in the rare languages <br/>
(languages other than the normal racial languages) can usually be sold <br/>
for about 5pp, more for Thieves Cant.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has anyone noticed that the obscure bard guildmasters seem to<br/>
&gt; &gt; teach all the languages out there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As your level increases, more languages appear to be trained.  I check<br/>
&gt; back every few levels to see if any additional ones appeared.  A few came<br/>
&gt; in at 5, then a few more around 10, more still somewhere between 10 and<br/>
&gt; 20, and at 20 most of the &quot;standard&quot; race languages were available for<br/>
&gt; training (gnomish, elvish, etc).  I&#39;d love to train them someday, but no<br/>
&gt; doubt it would take a while by someone who does know it (don&#39;t know if<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s possible to raise skill simply by speaking in it).  After about 20<br/>
&gt; minutes of nonstop spamming from a 6-line /g social, my Elvish is &quot;very<br/>
&gt; good.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Note that you must zone before language improvements take effect, at least<br/>
&gt; from learning by ear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And you wondered what to do with all your practice points. -.-<br/>
