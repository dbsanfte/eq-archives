You learn something new every day.  I guess I haven´┐¢t tried it on a yellow<br/>
con yet.  I´┐¢ve had very few resists with what I have tried it on (mostly<br/>
kodiaks in GD.  Why do they cripple our charm skill so late in the career??<br/>
Are there other classes in the game that have a feature skill drastically<br/>
nerfed as the get higher in lvl?  Seems strange to me.<br/>
