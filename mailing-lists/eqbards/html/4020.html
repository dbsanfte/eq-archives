<b>Subject:</b> Mino Horn is WIND only <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-439527878">To put this subject to rest, mino horn is a WIND instrument only.  I have <br/>
the level 42 song.  When play with a horn, str is increased by 30 points.  <br/>
When play with MINO horn, flute, drum, lute, or weapons, str is increased by <br/>
15 points.<br/>

&gt;Is there any way we can get some confirmation about the minotaur horn&#39;s<br/>
&gt;usage?  I have heard from some that it is only Wind, and now we have <br/>
&gt;someone<br/>
&gt;who claims it also works for Brass...can anyone confirm this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also have a question on this:  can you use the mino horn to raise the<br/>
&gt;brass skill?  Currently my brass is maxed for my level, but I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;lugging around a brass instrument just for this purpose, would be nice if I<br/>
&gt;could sell it back to the vendor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did try the song with the mino horn, and it does work.  But I&#39;m not sure<br/>
&gt;if its because I&#39;m singing it while just holding the horn, or if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;actually using the horn.<br/>
