<div id="ygrps-yiv-868824057">Interesting ideas, but he was solely tracking the average damage he did per<br/>
hit.  i.e. he hit 200 times for 1800 points with no other warrior types in<br/>
group but only hit 200 times for 1350 points with another warrior type in<br/>
group.  His buffs remained constant he says.  The one possibility I thought<br/>
of was that since the mobs were dying twice as fast, the mobs were only<br/>
allowing him to hit them half as often when they were stunned or in that<br/>
vulnerable agility reduced state they get in when badly wounded.<br/>

Kit,<br/>
<br/>
    I regularly group with my RL brother who plays a gnome warrior and<br/>
I&#39;ve seen similar symptoms. However, the symptoms I&#39;ve seen can be<br/>
explained without implying strange code. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if<br/>
such code existed knowing Verant, however the usual causes and<br/>
explanations I&#39;ve seen are as follows.<br/>
<br/>
Situation #1: bard and warrior add a second melee<br/>
    Warrior(21) and bard(21) fighting single pulls. The bard buffs the<br/>
warrior (playing Anthem, Largos, Hymn/Chords with lute or DDD with<br/>
horn). The warrior is doing nice damage because of Anthem buffing his<br/>
STR and ATK speed and taking little damage because of Largos and the<br/>
DoT is helping weaken the enemy life (or life + AC with Denons.)<br/>
Twisting in Hymn near the end instead of Chords/DDD reduces downtime<br/>
to almost nothing. The group adds a second warrior that doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand taunt and starts fighting multiple pulls. Bard is getting<br/>
smacked around a lot more thus strength buffing is less consistent.<br/>
Also, the enemy is being slowed down less thus bashing the warrior<br/>
more thus reducing the average damage even more.  Invalid example<br/>
because the fight was changed? Yes. But did your ogre warrior guild<br/>
mate consider the group dynamics when calculating his statistics?<br/>
<br/>
Situation #2: warrior and druid add a second melee<br/>
    Warrior grouped with Druid. Fighting aviaks at the 3 spawn in Lake<br/>
Rathetear. Druid buffs self with Thistlecoat, SoW, Skin Like Rock,<br/>
Strength of Earth, Firefist. Druid buffs warrior with SoW, Skin Like<br/>
Rock, Strength of Earth and during battles, Thorn shield. That&#39;s 3<br/>
birds in 6 minutes. Warrior pulls as they pop. Druid casts thorn<br/>
shield on the warrior then casts snare, flame lick, stinging swarm on<br/>
the bird then meditates. The druid finds himself gradually going down<br/>
in mana overall. They decide to add a (insert melee class here.)  The<br/>
druid no longer has the mana pool to buff both melee classes, cast<br/>
DoTs, thorn shield, snares, etc. and med it back before the repop but<br/>
with the second melee, the buffs aren&#39;t required. Druid elects not to<br/>
use Strength of Earth since it just makes the battle go faster and<br/>
reduces the effectiveness of the DoTs but he keeps up the Skin Like<br/>
Rock to reduce damage. The battles go really well but the warrior is<br/>
now doing less damage on average because he&#39;s missing Strength of<br/>
Earth and he doesn&#39;t even notice the missing buff because the fights<br/>
are much easier. Average damage per warrior goes down. Average damage<br/>
overall goes up a lot (from the second melee.) Eventually the druid<br/>
will be able to regain enough mana to cast Strength of Earth but at<br/>
that point there&#39;s no incentive to use it because they are already<br/>
keeping the spawn clear easily.  Perhaps your ogre warrior guild mate<br/>
didn&#39;t take into account which buffs he had on while tracking his<br/>
damage? This situation can apply with any caster that can buff<br/>
strength.<br/>
<br/>
Situation #3: warrior and enchanter add a second melee<br/>
    Warrior and enchanter are grouped in Upper Guk fighting at the<br/>
antechamber to the Scryer room. They are fighting appropriate level<br/>
creatures. Warrior is permanently buffed with Mist and Strengthen.<br/>
Warrior gets buffed in-battle with quickness. Enchanter mezzes extras<br/>
to make sure they only fight one frog at a time. Enchanter also casts<br/>
languid pace on the frog that the warrior is fighting. They add a<br/>
second melee to try clearing more of the Scryer room. Enchanter buffs<br/>
second melee with Mist (mana expensive) and Strengthen (mana cheap.)<br/>
Enchanter keeps other creatures mezzed and still uses quickness on the<br/>
warrior. Doesn&#39;t bother with quickness on the second melee because<br/>
it&#39;s expensive and they are primarily extra melee damage on the back<br/>
of the creature. The enchanter also doesn&#39;t bother with Languid Pace<br/>
because the solo frogs die too fast to make it worth the mana cost<br/>
since two melees are beating down one frog.  Average damage of the<br/>
warrior goes down because he is getting hit more.  Damage speed and<br/>
power stay the same because he still has the same buffs.  Perhaps your<br/>
ogre warrior guild mate didn&#39;t take into account the spells being cast<br/>
on the enemies when calculating his average damage?  This situation<br/>
can apply with any caster that can reduce enemy AC or attack speed.<br/>
<br/>
Situation #4: warrior and cleric (no STR buff) add a second melee<br/>
    Let&#39;s say the warrior and his cleric friend are fighting Dervish<br/>
Cutthroats in South Ro. They are slightly underpowered to take the<br/>
camp but will be able to clear it. The camp is a 3 derv spawn.  They<br/>
shout out for another melee to add to the group because they know it<br/>
will be tough to keep clearing 3 every 6 minutes and it will be much<br/>
safer to fight with one more person. The camp currently has 3 dervs -<br/>
human (wizard), human (rogue), human(rogue).  The cleric uses Soothe<br/>
and they start the fight with the wizard. The warrior tries to<br/>
interrupt the casting with bash and tries to keep it taunted to him<br/>
while the cleric blasts with Strike/Smite. The fight goes well.  Next,<br/>
the cleric Soothes again and the warrior pulls a rogue. No problem.<br/>
This fight is fairly straightforward. Then they pull the second rogue<br/>
and finish it off two.  At that point, they add another melee to their<br/>
group and start working on the re-pop while the cleric recovers. The<br/>
two melees should take less damage and finish off each derv easily.<br/>
The camp repops with barbarian (rogue), ogre (rogue), human (rogue).<br/>
Now the warrior continues to be the primary tank but this time around,<br/>
he is getting bashed more and thus doing less average damage. Perhaps<br/>
your ogre warrior guild mate has mistakenly forgotten to take into<br/>
account coincidental bad luck with a spawn when adding a second melee?<br/>
This situation can apply with any spawn site that is being continually<br/>
cleared and that has a random variation of enemies that can bash, and<br/>
enemies that can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
As an addendum, there are variations between spawns of the same<br/>
creature that also complicate this fourth situation. Sometimes, a<br/>
creature will be the same level as a previous one but is a lot tougher<br/>
despite still being even.<br/>
<br/>
For example: Let&#39;s say you have a group with a druid, enchanter,<br/>
magician, warrior and cleric. The warrior fights a froglok(warrior)<br/>
that cons even. The druid flame licks and snares, the magician blasts,<br/>
the enchanter mezzez the others nearby yet has trouble with one in<br/>
particular. A floglok warrior that also cons even. When the warrior<br/>
gets to that second froglok warrior that cons even, he fights it as<br/>
normal. The druid casts Flame Lick... resisted. again. resisted.<br/>
again. resisted. again. sticks. Snare... resisted. again. resisted.<br/>
again. sticks.  The magician blasts. resisted. again. resisted. again.<br/>
does damage equal to the previous froglok warrior.  Either everyone<br/>
had bad luck with the random number generator simultaneously or there<br/>
was something special about that second froglok warrior.  Either<br/>
situation is possible and adds another layer of complication to the<br/>
damage statistics the warrior might try to collect even taking into<br/>
account situation #4.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm. This seems to have become yet another long post. Sorry for the<br/>
spam. It&#39;s not really related to bards.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Group composition effect on Damage?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s a question for the knowledgeable out there.  Our guild&#39;s ogre<br/>
warrior<br/>
&gt; has been tracking his average damage per hit for some time now.<br/>
Apparently<br/>
&gt; if he is grouped with any group not including another warrior, or a<br/>
ranger,<br/>
&gt; or a rogue, or a monk, or a paladin, he inflicts 15% more damage on<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; average per hit basis than he does when there is another one of<br/>
those types<br/>
&gt; in the group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t had a chance to check his numbers yet, but I did observe<br/>
that he<br/>
&gt; rarely hits for over 80 when grouped with myself and a ranger.  When<br/>
grouped<br/>
&gt; with just myself against the same mobs he often hit for over 80 and<br/>
&gt; sometimes even 100 without criticals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anybody heard of anything like this before?<br/>
