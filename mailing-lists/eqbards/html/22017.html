&gt;Aye Musiker is on occasionally. Convinced him to do some soloing in<br/>
&gt;Dreadlands. Last I saw, he was 40.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hehe, You dident convince me to do some soloing *Grin* I almost NEVER solo. I<br/>
hate soloing, its too damned boring IMO.<br/>
I have started to hunt with groups in Dreadlands, on the north wall of karnor to<br/>
be precise. I still find that 3 spawn in Overthere gives me better experince<br/>
overall + I have just about hunted so many berzerkers that I am able to enter<br/>
the outpost without my mask (They con threathingly without the mask) So I think<br/>
I will do my last bubble of hell (40th) in OT.<br/>
Btw I almost never have problems finding a group. Only problem is that the zones<br/>
where people hunt during my playhours, are the same well known zones which is<br/>
tottaly crowded during peek hours. I guess thats the curse of playing on the<br/>
hours where there is less than 1k people on the server - I seldom get to fight<br/>
in the less populated zones like dalnir.<br/>

&gt;Was funny, I tried to charm them and after the 4th failure remembered that<br/>
&gt;they can&#39;t be charmed. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can&#39;t say the loot has been to great, but not many people in the zone so<br/>
&gt;the lag isn&#39;t too bad.<br/>

&gt;Happily sitting at his 40th song, in no rush to 50. :-)<br/>
