<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472230467">At you groups level it is very possible to for your party to solo Death<br/>
beetles and tormented dead.  If you stay on the right side of the house<br/>
(the gazebo) you should be able to pull them one by one with your lull<br/>
song.  It was great xp and will shot you from 14 to 16 very quickly.  The<br/>
only problem stems from the fact that it is very easy to be trained by<br/>
beetles and undead and on my server it is grand central station at times.<br/>

&gt; Hi.  I stumbled upon this list and I&#39;m so glad I found it. I wish I had known about it sooner.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am Telania, prior 15th lvl bard lady.::pouts::  I died shortly after hitting my new mark in HighPass.. (them dumb Orcs).  I was thinking of heading to Unrest with my RL hubby who is a 14th lvl WE Warrior.  But after reading about Unrest I dont&#39; think we&#39;re ready.  Sounds like we need to mature just a tad bit more.. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ANYWAY, now that i&#39;ve side tracked.. where is a good spot for my lvl to be?  I&#39;ve taken other suggestions like one, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;go to kerra isle! Good loot and easy&quot;. uh, They like forgot to mention Trains.  Died quiet harshly I might add. eh<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I will ask my brethen.. HELP?! hehe <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any and all would be appriecated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thank you <br/>
