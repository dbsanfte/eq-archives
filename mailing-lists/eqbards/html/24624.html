<div id="ygrps-yiv-9348562">Different instruments don&#39;t affect songs differently, except for the % increase they provide.  You&#39;re not going to find one awesome string instrument that does affect the mana regen portion of Cantana where others do not.  You can simply take a store bought lute, test for any increases and adjust that for all instruments with higher bonuses.  There&#39;s no secrets or surprises here.<br/>

  Ah, ok.  Erp, how do we know it does not increase mana regen though?  I&#39;ve seen tests about the songs before, and how they stack, but I don&#39;t recall seeing whether a different stringed instrument would afftect the song differently.<br/>

    I know it is less than Kelin&#39;s, so maybe 25% bonus give or take?<br/>
