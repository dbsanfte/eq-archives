Subject: [eqbards] Twisting question<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a question on twisting songs.  I&#39;m a 8th level bard with a DEX<br/>
rating<br/>
&gt; of 95 and singing/intrument skills maxed out for my level (45).  I have<br/>
&gt; noticed when I attempt to twist I miss a lot of notes and as a result<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; reap the full benefits of twisting.  Is the ability to twist songs based<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; your DEX rating, your singing skill, or both?  Does the level of the song<br/>
&gt; also come into play?  For example, as an 8th level bard with a singing<br/>
skill<br/>
&gt; of 45, at this stage in my career I may not be skilled enough to twist the<br/>
&gt; 6th and 8th level songs successfully.  However, down the road when my<br/>
&gt; singing skill improves to 70 I would have no problem with that combo.  At<br/>
&gt; that point, twisting the 12th and 13th level songs would give me trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most of the time I use a weapon in combat so should the DEX rating even<br/>
come<br/>
&gt; into play since I&#39;m not playing an instrument.  When I created my<br/>
character,<br/>
&gt; I put points into the standard bard stats such as STR, DEX, and CHR.  I<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; put a few into AGI to improve my AC.  Should I have put more into DEX than<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; did? I enjoy playing with this character and will continue to play them.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; ask this question because if I will never be good at twisting due to my<br/>
DEX<br/>
&gt; rating, I will just play one song at a time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks ahead for any reply<br/>
