&gt; Some things do need fixing though like the rogue skills, druids at high<br/>

classes to play at the early and mid levels.  It makes sense<br/>
that they should become difficult at the end.  I don&#39;t<br/>
particularly like it when games are designed like that, since<br/>
it means a choice you make based on your first few weeks of<br/>
play can have negative repurcussions several months later.  <br/>
Ideally all classes should be roughly equivalent to each other<br/>
all the way through their advancement, but that&#39;s not the<br/>
paradigm EQ chose.<br/>

And I thought we had a couple high level songs which lowered<br/>
monster resists?<br/>
