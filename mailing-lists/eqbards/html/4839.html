<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621289181">This is only true at very low levels.  The spread in the group also seems<br/>
to have something to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being level 13 in unrest - and making terrific experience with a<br/>
group of 20&#39;s.  Being a bard - I didn&#39;t have to lay a finger on them to be<br/>
of benefit to the group - which is good, cause I can never hit anything red<br/>
to me anyway. As I remember, Anthem and Selo&#39;s was my major contributions<br/>
that trip. Folks I was with were certainly glad for the Selo&#39;s on more than<br/>
one occassion, as well as the puller who seemed to have a nasty habit of<br/>
getting rooted by ghouls in the house.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that after 10 - and the higher you get in levels, the less<br/>
difference that makes.<br/>
<br/>
People think twinking of items is bad - this practice is to keep the same<br/>
thing from happening with experience.  Imagine a group of 30&#39;s or 40&#39;s with<br/>
a lvl 1 in the group (presuming they could keep him alive which is<br/>
doubtful). At those levels - every monster would give the low level a level<br/>
or more. I know at 13, just what the 20&#39;s were killing seemed a quarter, or<br/>
half bubble to me each.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, like twinking items - this might seem like a shortcut - but can<br/>
you imagine being lvl 10, with only 15 or 20 in a weapon skill? Folks that<br/>
rush experience at the expense of their skills all wind up regretting it<br/>
sooner or later.<br/>

&gt;&gt; My first night as level 20 and I went<br/>
&gt;&gt; to HighHold Keep.  Got into a group with<br/>
&gt;&gt; others ranging to 27 with me the lowest<br/>
&gt;&gt; most of the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but with a group of people that high up in level<br/>
&gt;(up to 7 above you), isn&#39;t it true that you&#39;d get very little to no<br/>
&gt;experience from the fights? I remember when I was level 5 and my friend was<br/>
&gt;level 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting experience when we were<br/>
&gt;grouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that even when the<br/>
&gt;levels are closer, the people with the higher levels get more experience<br/>
&gt;than the lower levels regardless of who does the most damage. Of course if<br/>
&gt;you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I was just curious<br/>
&gt;if you got any experience from it. </span></blockquote></div>
