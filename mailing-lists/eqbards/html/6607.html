&gt;Heh heh, no I do think its hopeless now.  That&#39;s not the part I find funny,<br/>

&gt;&gt; No matter what they say I still find it hilarious that people consider it<br/>
&gt;a<br/>

&gt;Umm. Do you somehow get the idea it&#39;s not currently hopeless? If you<br/>
&gt;want a real plane of fear that works like the current one but is a bit<br/>
&gt;cheaper on system resources they should just make a gate that kills you<br/>
&gt;and deletes your body when you use it. We currently have the same basic<br/>
&gt;effect. There&#39;s a big difference between really scarey and unplayable.<br/>
