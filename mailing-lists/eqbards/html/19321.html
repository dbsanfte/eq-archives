<div id="ygrps-yiv-285848829">Heh I&#39;ll go you one better:<br/>
<br/>
I have played a bard to 30 in Beta<br/>
A bard to 51 on Test<br/>
A bard to 42 on Veeshan/Saryrn<br/>
A bard to 40 on Tallon Zek<br/>
A bard to 15 on Rallos Zek<br/>
<br/>
And I have lost, due to a combination of accidently dropping LORE items and<br/>
the Lore item POOF bug a total of about 21,000pp in items.<br/>
<br/>
1 Yak, 1 MM drum, 1 LotGP, 1 BTC and recently one of the new bard daggers<br/>
(forget which one)<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people never run into the problem.  But some of us don&#39;t have<br/>
perfect mice ;)<br/>
<br/>
And this isn&#39;t a major redesign of the client.  It&#39;s a very very minor<br/>
change to the client that would allow players to set a flag to keep them<br/>
from dropping things.  It&#39;s not hard to code.  We wouldn&#39;t even need a<br/>
confirm option.  Just yes you can drop it or no you can&#39;t.  Gordon has even<br/>
said it could be done.<br/>

&gt; &gt;YOU ARENT FLAGGING YOUR ITEMS!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You are just setting a flag ON YOUR CLIENT that won&#39;t let you drop yer<br/>
junk<br/>
&gt; &gt;on the ground.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i would be willing to bet that there is no such flag existing in the eq<br/>
engine today.<br/>
&gt; as i said in another responce, they will not be willing to redesign the eq<br/>
engine<br/>
&gt; for something this small (which is really an inconvenience not some earth<br/>
shattering<br/>
&gt; bug).  i have played my primary bard to level 50 and a secondary bard to<br/>
level 21.<br/>
&gt; both switch weapons and/or instruments in combat.  neither has ever ever<br/>
ever<br/>
&gt; dropped an item.  why?  because i&#39;m damn careful whenever i use the<br/>
hotkeys to<br/>
&gt; switch equipment.<br/>
