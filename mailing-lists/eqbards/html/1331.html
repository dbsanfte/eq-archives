<div id="ygrps-yiv-16608868">I know Crag Spiders move SLIGHTLY faster than you can run at an agility of<br/>
100.  However you can strafe run and move SLIGHTLY faster than they can.<br/>
When you get bellow, for all of you lower level bards out there, it opens up<br/>
a whole new world of cheating -=).  Although it seems everyone has tried it<br/>
at least once, it&#39;s generally frowned upon by non druids.  But hey,<br/>
sometimes there&#39;s no one to group with, especially during non peak hours.<br/>
It&#39;s either that or wasting the night, awash with short beer.  And by the<br/>
way I am in no way advocating cheating.  You simply must find ways to play<br/>
smarter as a bard.<br/>

Those of you who play only a bard may not have noticed that<br/>
giant scarabs and goblins (at least the low-level ones) move<br/>
slower than you can normally run.<br/>
