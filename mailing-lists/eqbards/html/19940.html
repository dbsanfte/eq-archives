&gt;for a change.  It&#39;s never been my primary server (ok it was while I was<br/>
&gt;powerlevelling myself to 50 there) so it&#39;s no big deal.  But it was my only<br/>
&gt;50 char :(  My character on Saryrn is only 44 as of now.  It was nice to be<br/>
&gt;able to say I had a 50.  Guess I just gotta work that much harder to get<br/>
&gt;another ;)<br/>

&gt;remember to corpses getting stuck in walls, in geography in gates, whatever.<br/>
&gt;Then to get wiped with no notice because Verant f&#39;d up?  Nah, thanks I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;stick to a live server.  At least they back those up regularly.<br/>
