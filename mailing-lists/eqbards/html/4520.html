<b>Subject:</b> RE: Limit on song memorization <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094398679"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Does anyone think that bards should not be limited to<br/>
&gt; memorizing only eight songs at a time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to see 8 more bubbles on the right side of the screen opposite the<br/>
8 we all have now. Verant could even make it so that it&#39;s a level thing that<br/>
you couldn&#39;t use the other 8 spots until say level such and such (15+) like<br/>
dual wield. Makes sense. You get more experienced and are able to remember<br/>
more songs. Especially if you&#39;ve been playing the first 8 songs for 15+<br/>
levels of your life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem <br/>
&gt; with this. Many of their spells at higher levels are just<br/>
&gt; improved versions of spells they had at lower levels.<br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t really have to worry about memorizing their low<br/>
&gt; level spells once they reach a certain point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d disagree here. Spellcasting classes use spells all of their lives and<br/>
normally have much higher INT/WIS stats than we as Bards do. Thus it would<br/>
make more sense for them to be able to expand their # of memorized spells<br/>
than not.</div>
