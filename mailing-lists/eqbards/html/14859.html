<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902632400">I posted a request on an E&#39;ci board asking any Kedge vets if they had ever<br/>
seen Sharkskin drums.  I got a reply from one of the most well known players<br/>
on E&#39;ci.  He verified that sharksin drums are a legitimate item.  He has the<br/>
respect of a lot of people so I&#39;m inclined to trust whatever he says.  So if<br/>
any of you high level bards want to get a Sharkskin Drum there is a spoiler<br/>
below on how to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

If you&#39;re in Estrellas main room, facing her spawn with the mermaid room to<br/>
the right and the left of you...Turn left and go into that room, on your<br/>
right, slightly elevated, is a little &quot;hole in the wall&quot;. Go in there. Now<br/>
to your left is a tube going UP. You need to go up this tube. <br/>
<br/>
At the top of the tube when you start going forward is a dangerous room for<br/>
an unprepared party. You&#39;ll be facing an open hallway of sorts that leads<br/>
into a big round room which has a big block in the middle of it, and a<br/>
cathedral ceiling. At the top of that room..the VERY top, is Undertow. <br/>
<br/>
BE CAREFUL. When you get to the top of the tube and start going forward<br/>
again STOP. The room you are about to enter has a trap in it. Immediately<br/>
upon entering the room go LEFT and hide back in the corner. If you&#39;re lucky,<br/>
you&#39;ll only aggro 1 or 2 piranahs. (refer to my ascii drawing below). Pull<br/>
the rest of the fish in the ceiling, and then on the other side of the room<br/>
(if you were to take a right from the tube) is a mermaid placeholder. The<br/>
rare spawn of this carries the drum.<br/>

The arrow at the bottom is pointing to where you enter the room. The X is<br/>
where you should camp from, the D is where the mermaid with the drum is, and<br/>
the U is the room where undertow is at the top. Be wary when pulling this<br/>
room...2 high level seahorses patrol the bottom. <br/>

Got my SharkSkin Drums tonight.  Many thanks to the Twelve Year Guild on<br/>
Cazic-Thule.  <br/>
<br/>
The SharkSkin Drums are found on a named Mermaid called Coralyn Kelpma. She<br/>
spawns past Estrella, just to the right of the 5 StingTooths in the Ceiling<br/>
and right outside of the Seahorse Caves. A normal Gloomwater is her<br/>
placeholder. We came upon her by accident as she spawned 20 min after we<br/>
killed her placeholder. I had never heard of her before. Now I wonder what<br/>
her rare loot is. Grin. She looks like she is equipped with a lute when she<br/>
has these.</div>
