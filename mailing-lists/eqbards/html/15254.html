<br/>
- Yes, the 30% slowdown from Binding and Chain is equivalent<br/>
to hasting your group by 30%.  It&#39;s actually a little better<br/>
as not only is it equivalent to hasting their attacks, but<br/>
also their healing rate, mana regen rate, casting delays,<br/>
etc. relative to the mob(s).  So in general, slowing down the<br/>
mob is better than speeding up your group.  But speeding up<br/>
your group can never be resisted.<br/>
<br/>
- No, the slowdown doesn&#39;t affect mob casting speed.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, you can use Chain and Warsong to get an equivalent to a<br/>
56% haste (1.3*1.2) relative to the mob.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, you can use Chain and Anthem to get an equivalent to a<br/>
43% haste (1.3*1.1) relative to the mob.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, you can use Chain and Celerity to get an equivalent to<br/>
a 50% haste (1.3*1.15) relative to the mob.<br/>
<br/>
With the really disappointing (nonexistant) results from str<br/>
buffs, I would say speeding your group and slowing the mob<br/>
take top priority in increasing damage output.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
bother with Chant of Battle unless the AC buff is reducing the<br/>
damage you&#39;re taking by &gt;15%, which is highly unlikely.<br/>
