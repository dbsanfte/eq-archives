&gt; A factor in this decision is this: Does the type of armor have an impact on<br/>
&gt; amount of damage received.  I know better armor increases AC but does it<br/>
&gt; also reduce damage taken?  For example, I get hit in combat and the random<br/>
&gt; number generator says I take 40 points of damage.  Currently I&#39;m wearing<br/>
&gt; Crush&#39;s ringmail tunic.  If I was wearing bronze plate, would the damage I<br/>
&gt; received be lower, say like 30pts, due to the plate armor reducing the force<br/>

that normally dinged me for 1-2 points (with the occasional<br/>
10-20) in plate were hitting me for 20 points regularly.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know if this was due to the type of armor, or because in<br/>
mesh my AC was 50 points lower.<br/>
