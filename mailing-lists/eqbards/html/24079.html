<br/>
De Mask - 13+ hours now in that stupid little friggin assassin room in lguk,<br/>
at levels that I have no business being down there, and I still don&#39;t have a<br/>
mask.  Your level 3 bards you&#39;re referring to are twinked, lucky, or a<br/>
combination.  Doesn&#39;t apply to a bard like myself, who, after wasting<br/>
entirely too much time trying to get the stupid thing, has chosen to wait<br/>
until I&#39;m a sufficient level to go sit in that room and earn it, now.  Too<br/>
damn many hours wasted with nothing to show for it but a couple deaths, and<br/>
not a little frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Glowing stone band - Never heard of it until now.  *Another* thing I have to<br/>
wait my turn to camp?  Or quest that requires me to wait my turn to camp<br/>
something to get something to...bah...  See * below.<br/>
<br/>
Caster cast Ultra - how long to wait for a caster to cast it on me?  How<br/>
long before it wears off?  How long a wait for yet another caster to cast it<br/>
on me?  See * below.<br/>
<br/>
* So I only have to type it once, instead of 3 times:  Why the hell should<br/>
I?  I have a friggin song that is really easy to mem, and unmem as needed,<br/>
that does exactly what I want it to do.  Ultravision.  No waiting for a<br/>
caster who might be willing to help, no more sitting in a room that doesn&#39;t<br/>
give me xp watching other people play the game, and, largely, no camping, or<br/>
blowing plat on an item that does something that a song I&#39;ve already<br/>
purchased does for me.  I buy all the songs.  Why?  Because plat is getting<br/>
easier to come by all the time, and in that sense, songs aren&#39;t<br/>
cheap...they&#39;re friggin cheap.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a half elf, with infravision.  Normally, I don&#39;t bother.  However, some<br/>
zones at night either are darker, or seem darker, than usual.  Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
me, maybe it&#39;s my video card.  Whatever, I&#39;ve found Concorde to be<br/>
exceedingly useful in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, while Concorde is useless to you, I, on the other hand, find it<br/>
useful at times.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this to be argumentative, I&#39;m saying this because, as far as<br/>
I&#39;m concerned, this song has uses.  And I should know, I&#39;m using it.<br/>
<br/>
I will refrain from the multitude of comments regarding your &quot;should be<br/>
booted&quot; comment.  While I respect most opinions, this one get&#39;s the big<br/>
/rude from me.  I&#39;m not some uber twink mega bard, but I&#39;m a damn good one,<br/>
and I resent that statement.<br/>

ANY bard that is wasting a song slot to sing this should be booted. Get a<br/>
cold stone, get a DE mask (I know level 3 bards with this), get a glowing<br/>
stone band, get a caster to cast ultra vision on you. WHATEVER. This song is<br/>
useless, and to try to justify it by saying that there are a few select uses<br/>
for it is being argumentative.<br/>
<br/>
This song rates up there with Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge, Melody of Ervaj and<br/>
Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord.<br/>

end of &#39;&#39;it is useless&#39;&#39;.  if you were a human bard without a dark elf mask,<br/>
i believe you would find it very useful.<br/>
