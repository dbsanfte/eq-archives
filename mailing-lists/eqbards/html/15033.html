<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409364780">Yep, noticed this in Cazic also.  Easy way around it.  Leave the flute for<br/>
last, then right-click it.  It&#39;ll automatically go into your inventory or<br/>
bag without you having to pick it up.<br/>

&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was in unrest last night and had the unforutnate luck to be slaughtered<br/>
&gt; unrest style in the house. After hitting the bank and grabbing an extra<br/>
&gt; flute, I high tailed it into unrest to recovery my possessions. After<br/>
&gt; getting my corpse and pulling it to the wall I discovered a potentially<br/>
&gt; fatal bug for bards out there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had my mino horn equiped and was playing the invis song (as I often do<br/>
&gt; while looting my corpse) As I retrieved my items I picked up my original<br/>
&gt; mino horn from my corpse. At that precise moment, Shaurii&#39;s happened to<br/>
&gt; pulse and...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shaurii&#39;s Sonorus Clouding stopped and said you must have a wind<br/>
&gt; instrument<br/>
&gt; equpied.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What the???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I finished recovering my stuff and decided to test this extensively. Here<br/>
&gt; are my limited conclusions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have Mino Horn A equiped and playing Shaurii&#39;s, then you pick up<br/>
&gt; Mino<br/>
&gt; Horn B and place it on your pointer, then your song pulses, your song will<br/>
&gt; drop citing your lack of a wind instrument.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As of yet I have not tried any of this with actual flutes yet, but I was<br/>
&gt; able to replicate this bug over and over again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, the moral of the story is, if you are looting while invis in a<br/>
&gt; dangerous<br/>
&gt; area, be careful about picking up that wind instrument.<br/>
