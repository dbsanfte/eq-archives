Grenix Mucktail in High Pass frequently carries the Polished Granite<br/>
Tomahawk. He spawns up on the ledge by the west gate of High Pass Keep.<br/>
<br/>
Grenix, himself, isn&#39;t that tough. I solo&#39;d him at 20th level. A group of<br/>
15s can take him fairly easily. What&#39;s hard is the LONNNNNNNNG wait most<br/>
people have to endure, and the CAMPERS galore, and the numerous gnolls you<br/>
have to wade through until Grenix shows up.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a guard nearby who will jump in and steal your kill if you get<br/>
too close to him. I watched the Guard kill Grenix once as about a dozen<br/>
people stood around crying about it (smile).<br/>
<br/>
I am told, though, that Grenix&#39;s spawnrate has been recently more<br/>
&quot;Randomized&quot;. I do not know for sure, as I got my Tommy and left, never to<br/>
return to that ledge. Some say he can spawn 3 times an hour now, while<br/>
others say he still only spawns twice a day.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, Grenix&#39;s brother, Vexven, also pops in the same area, and<br/>
carries a nice shield called the Cracked Darkwood shield. VERY nice. From<br/>
what&#39;s I&#39;ve seen, Vexven usually shows up within 30 minutes to 2 hours after<br/>
Grenix shows.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt;The dirk is the best weapon you can get for free at such a low lvl too. I<br/>
&gt;was wondering if anyone can give me hint as to the gnoll that carry a<br/>
&gt;Tomahawk and what lvl is it?  I am currently lv 19.  I just want to know at<br/>
&gt;what lvl should I start getting a group together and go and kill it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thnx in advance,<br/>

&gt;Yes, a combine weapon is magical. They are nice weapons, but what you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>should<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;really look into getting is a Dragoon Dirk. If my database of weapons is<br/>
&gt;up-to-date, it would appear that there is only ONE combine weapon better<br/>
&gt;than the Dirk....The 2 Handed Combine Sword. All I can say is...DIRK ROCKS.<br/>
&gt;I just had the absolute BEST fortune to pick one up for free last night. I<br/>
&gt;think I will be very happy with it indeed...<br/>
