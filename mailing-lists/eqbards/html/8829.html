&gt; Another thing is Pixie Strike is not broken.  It just won&#39;t work against <br/>

&gt; mes, or pixie strike type of spells.  I don&#39;t know if this was introduced <br/>

send forth music&quot; message and icon, but will not be stunned.  <br/>
If you wait for the icon to disappear, you will get the &quot;you<br/>
are no longer stunned&quot; message even though you were never<br/>
stunned!<br/>
<br/>
It *is* broken.<br/>
