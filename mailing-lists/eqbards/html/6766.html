<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645482921">Ditto John.  I was in the process of thinking out how I was gonna reply to<br/>
this thread.  You saved me the time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this &quot;Bard Only Equipment&quot; thread is one of the longest threads I can<br/>
remember reading.  The digest subscribers are gonna have lots of fun sifting<br/>
through it I would imagine (be sure to cut and paste to help them out) .<br/>
The thread also proves once again that this list is one of the best EQ<br/>
forums around.  People are disagreeing on some of the issues but continue to<br/>
respect others opinions and avoid getting into flamewars.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually, it&#39;s odd. Until very very recently this list was populated<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion of how to get the most from the class not complaining about<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; how it was nerfed, broken, ignored, unattended to.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As the latest patches did not change us radically (SoW/Selos/Root/chain<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been messed up in different ways forever), it must be some other factor<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How have they been messed up?  I think the change is because<br/>
&gt; until the latest Chain/Selo&#39;s/root fiascos, we were masters of<br/>
&gt; our destiny.  From level 5, we had almost nothing to fear.  <br/>
&gt; If things got bad, we could always bail out.  If facing<br/>
&gt; multiple mobs, we had the tools to break them up or control<br/>
&gt; them.  The latest changes have started chipping away at that,<br/>
&gt; putting us more and more at the mercy of others (being rooted,<br/>
&gt; being SoWed, Chain not stopping runners, etc).  While in<br/>
&gt; themselves they are minor changes, they represent a major<br/>
&gt; shift in the amount of control we have over what happens to<br/>
&gt; us.<br/>
