<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105030774">At level 15, I also have used Lament to very good affect.  I haven&#39;t even <br/>
bothered buying the lullaby song after the complaints I&#39;ve been reading on <br/>
this board.<br/>
<br/>
In camping the big mountain bandit camp in NK, I can make all the blues sad <br/>
and pull the one that cons black (often without dying :) ).   If I sing to a <br/>
MOB and don&#39;t get any response, I find If I move in a bit closer, retarget <br/>
and sing again I&#39;ll get a response.  The most interesting thing I&#39;ve found <br/>
is that if a blue MOB resists, it rarely attacks! (could it be charisma? <br/>
mine is a modified 92) I retarget and sing again until I make him sad.  Then <br/>
I pick them off one at a time.  I&#39;ve garned some applause from groups I&#39;ve <br/>
been in when doing this.  As a safety precaution, after every pull I sing <br/>
the lament again to every MOB in case it has worn off.  Although I&#39;ve used <br/>
this technique with success, I always have Selo&#39;s and some drums handy in <br/>
case things go terribly wrong (and they will until you get the hang of it -- <br/>
you might even want to hotkey a &#39;train to zone&#39; message :) ).<br/>
<br/>
PS  Saftey Tip:  When you pull in this manner (esp at the NK camp), pull <br/>
them FAR AWAY from the others.  Bandits in NK like to travel from camp to <br/>
camp and could show up unexpectedly.<br/>

&gt;Lament is one of the most powerful songs in our arsenel (if you can get <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;group to let you pull that is).  Lulaby is a waste of time.  I prefer to<br/>
&gt;call it &quot;Kelin&#39;s suicide&quot; and I refuse to mem it.  I flat out told a party<br/>
&gt;they could all go solo nagafen before I&#39;d bother memming it when they told<br/>
&gt;me they wanted me to try it.<br/>

&gt;Kelin just suxors! :P  Personally, don&#39;t waste the time with the song<br/>
&gt;because I feel it will get you killed more than it will save your<br/>
&gt;butt.  Just my opinions ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now I&#39;m having a bit<br/>
&gt;of a problem figuring out what to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a lot of<br/>
&gt;discussion on the list about this song, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually in relation to levels far above mine.  I&#39;ve been meaning to<br/>
&gt;write this since I got the darn song,<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; First, my experience with Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament.  When I first<br/>
&gt;got that song it didn&#39;t work for me at<br/>
&gt; &gt; all.  Always resisted.  Consistently got mobbed.  But as I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;leveled, it&#39;s become more useful.  I really<br/>
&gt; &gt; only try to use it on blues and I&#39;m having a very good success rate<br/>
&gt;(knock on wood).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament was when I first<br/>
&gt;got it because I can&#39;t see when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden surrounded.  I pick a small<br/>
&gt;group of blues.  Run up and turn on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot;<br/>
&gt;message.  Then they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>
&gt; &gt; me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Can someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong or if this song<br/>
&gt;just really sucks that bad?  Should I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use it?  But then I<br/>
&gt;thought I recalled from previous<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion that it&#39;s completely useless after level 24? or 27?  So<br/>
&gt;why bother for just a few levels of<br/>
&gt; &gt; use?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any advice.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lyressa - level 17<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nameless<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; p.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to have to give him a<br/>
&gt;piece of my mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>
&gt; &gt; soundly on the butt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
