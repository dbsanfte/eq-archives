<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312231487"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Let me cut to the chase:  If you were in a zone with nothing<br/>
&gt;to hunt, would you continue playing?  Would most people<br/>
&gt;continue playing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never seen NOTHING to hunt - ever. I am an extremely patient hunter, I<br/>
have lots of other things to do between spawns than sit and complain the<br/>
area is too crowded I&#39;m bored (the #1 thing that will make me drop a group,<br/>
quicker even than dumb/dangerous stunts)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t see how you can claim it&#39;s not attributable to people<br/>
&gt;when everything else is the same and the only differing factor<br/>
&gt;is people.  True, they are not deliberately and directly<br/>
&gt;preventing you from finding anything to hunt, but they are<br/>
&gt;doing it indirectly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then why are you laying the blame at their feet? That&#39;s like complaining<br/>
the roads are clogged during rush hour and it&#39;s the other drivers fault -<br/>
it accomplishes nothing - and those folks gotta get to work too.<br/>
Frustrating yes - but it&#39;s not THEIR fault.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now, if you don&#39;t care about finding mobs to kill, then I can<br/>
&gt;see why you feel the way you do.  But I hardly think that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;representative of the majority of the playerbase.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh - I hunt - but I take what comes, when it comes. Indeed - I love crafts<br/>
(even the sorry state they are in) a LOT of my time is spent killing<br/>
spiders and snakes (and other lower level mobs) for raw materials for<br/>
crafts. You know - all those mobs the higher levels usually don&#39;t even see<br/>
cause they are looking for that next experience raising message (and<br/>
usually complaining there is nothin to hunt).<br/>
<br/>
And no, I am probably not terribly representative of the majority of the<br/>
playerbase. I have two main characters, currently lvl 22 and 23 - and don&#39;t<br/>
particulary care when or if I ever level again. If my enjoyment comes from<br/>
existing in a world - why should I rush headlong to my own virtual death?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; They have as much right to be there as I do, while I could think of several<br/>
&gt;&gt; ways to handle this a bit better - I don&#39;t blame it on other folks - and<br/>
&gt;&gt; what they may or may not have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why are you putting an ethical spin on this?  Their reasons<br/>
&gt;for doing what they do are irrelevant (aside from how it<br/>
&gt;relates to their enjoyment of the game).  If there are too<br/>
&gt;many people playing the game as it was meant to be played, it<br/>
&gt;has a negative impact on overall player enjoyment.  There&#39;s no<br/>
&gt;ill will or malicious intent behind that, it&#39;s just the way it<br/>
&gt;is - supply falls short of demand so the public grows<br/>
&gt;discontent.  Given that inescapable fact, how do you best<br/>
&gt;design the game to mitigate this reduction in enjoyment?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, perhaps I have a little more empathy towards my fellow gamers. We<br/>
are, after all....stuck in the same boat so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
That is just one of the many reasons I do other things besides just hunt.<br/>
There are a multitude of things to do in EQ besides chase that next xp<br/>
point. Some people don&#39;t enjoy those things - that&#39;s fine - but they are<br/>
there if you avail themselves of it. Top of the list is socializing -<br/>
perhaps take a younger player under your wing for a little while, educate<br/>
them a little. If your sole aim is leveling as quickly as possible - and<br/>
you don&#39;t partake of any of the other things in the world - I can see how<br/>
that would quickly become frustrating.</div>
