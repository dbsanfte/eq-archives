<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242538080">Couldn&#39;t agree more with Jeff.<br/>
<br/>
The point of being a bard isn&#39;t to be a tank or a damage dealer (though in<br/>
some situations we can do an adequate job of dealing dmg).  Our *primary*<br/>
role is as a &quot;Downtime Reducer&quot;.  We reduce downtime with Regen, Magic<br/>
Reists, Mana regen, and our ability to haste, crowd control, charm, etc can<br/>
all also be looked at as ways of reducing downtime.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t in a group to add to the dmg directly.  We add in far more subtle<br/>
ways.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you just have to grit yer teeth and sing only manasong or wind up<br/>
gettin everyone axed.  Sometimes you nod to the guy who&#39;s better at things<br/>
and just try to enhance what he&#39;s doing and/or work on another area (snares,<br/>
dmg shields, you name it.)  It isn&#39;t like we lack variety in our powers.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Only problem is I don&#39;t have Clarity, or Psalm of Cooling, or Dennon&#39;s<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That would leave me twisting Chant of Battle and Hymn with resists and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;odd Pixie Strike.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you can do damage shield too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My weapon damage is laughable.  Even with a Harpoon of the Depths and an<br/>
&gt; &gt;Obsidian Shard, with the low taunt songs I&#39;m twisting, a ranger 5 levels<br/>
&gt; &gt;below me got the mobs attention twice as much as I did.  The only times I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was the target of choice was when I pulled or had to charm a mob off<br/>
&gt; &gt;someone.  Even with our high taunt factor, the songs I was singing<br/>
weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;effective enough to warrant more attention from the mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; umm, i always thought it was a good thing when i didn&#39;t get attention from<br/>
the mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m sure when I have manasong I&#39;ll have another option for twisting but<br/>
&gt; &gt;without being able to use my hard hitting songs I won&#39;t be an offensive<br/>
&gt; &gt;force when the &#39;chanter is around until I have three Chants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t need to be an offensive force to contribute to the group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s not in my nature to be solely a defensive presence, and I&#39;m not sure<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have the tools to do that job anyhow except vs. casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; well, that is a large part of a bard&#39;s nature.  at level 51, i am almost<br/>
purely<br/>
&gt; a defensive presence with 2 heal songs and Verses of Victory and the<br/>
occasional<br/>
&gt; crowd control<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What are good defensive tools against melee mobs?  The Damage shields<br/>
seem<br/>
&gt; &gt;weak considering we are fighting 1 mob 90% of the time.<br/>
