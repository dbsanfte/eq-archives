I spoke to Geoff about the original author&#39;s tests. It looks like there might be<br/>
*something* strange going on, but we&#39;ll have to run some more tests in House.<br/>
Geoff will take another look at it after he gets done with the first draft of<br/>
the expansion spells in the next few days.<br/>

Perhaps we&#39;re finally gonna see some corrective action on this.  I sure hope GZ<br/>
contacts either John Kim or Rokenn so one of them can explain the facts on this<br/>
issue to him directly. <br/>
