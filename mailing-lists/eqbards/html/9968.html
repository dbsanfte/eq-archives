&gt; &gt; them, I am quite comfortable with calling alpha loot<br/>
&gt; &gt; order.  I don&#39;t like FFA loot at all, for three reasons:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1)  it cheats the spellcasters, who are too far from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; action to get to loot the &quot;good&quot; bodies (plus I&#39;d rather<br/>
&gt; &gt; have them sitting on their tushies medding than running<br/>
&gt; &gt; around madly trying to get their fair share of treasure);<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) nobody ever thinks that they&#39;re looting their fair<br/>
&gt; &gt; share of FFA bodies; and 3) too many people leave the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;junk&quot; bodies behind, then mentally count them off against<br/>
&gt; &gt; you if you choose to loot them yourself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At higher levels, the primary concern is not becoming<br/>
&gt; encumbered with too much loot, so most people tend to just<br/>
&gt; loot what they need which is why FFA works.  At least I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t met anyone past about level 30 that went on a looting<br/>
&gt; binge when it was declared FFA.  In fact, I&#39;ve noticed we tend<br/>
&gt; to have a lot of corpses rot on us unlooted when it&#39;s FFA -<br/>
&gt; nobody wants to pick up the extra weight.  Looting out of<br/>
&gt; order was a pretty big problem at lower levels though.  One<br/>
&gt; guy I was grouped with immediately looted anything with a<br/>
&gt; weapon whether or not it was his turn, then began complaining<br/>
&gt; he was encumbered.  Needless to say, that group didn&#39;t last<br/>
&gt; long.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I would LIKE to be in a group like that, but I don&#39;t play as much <br/>
as I would like to, and I don&#39;t have a regular group.  And while <br/>
some of the players I end up with are like me (they just don&#39;t play <br/>
regularly), there are other not-so-neutral reasons why others are not in <br/>
regular groups.  Strict alpha loot avoids one of the most annoying loot <br/>
problems that I constantly run into, which is the guy who &quot;generously&quot; <br/>
loots less than his fair share of the crappy stuff in order to give him <br/>
self-justification for taking all the good stuff.  Hating to be greedy, <br/>
but I could still use a lot more money than I&#39;ve got in the bank.  An <br/>
occasional nice item would be good, too.  ;)<br/>
