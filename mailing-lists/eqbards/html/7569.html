&gt; &gt; I really think your connection speed is playing a huge factor<br/>
&gt; &gt; in this.  How the h*ll does a bard die 4 times in one night<br/>
&gt; &gt; passing through outdoor zones?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;ve obviously never met Chief Goonda and tried to recover<br/>
&gt;your corpse from his &quot;range of aggrivation&quot;. If you read my<br/>
&gt;example closely, you&#39;ll note that only the first pass was my<br/>
&gt;&quot;run through the zone&quot;. The others were me trying to recover<br/>
&gt;my corpse from a spot surrounded by pissed off Ogre&#39;s. I even<br/>
&gt;had invisibility cast on me by the only player willing to help<br/>
&gt;in the zone. They saw through it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chief Goonda, man do I how him a dozen or so deaths.  Me and a group of <br/>
friends foolishly tried to take on that ogre camp one night and then spent <br/>
the next 4 hours getting all of our corpses back :)  And this was when <br/>
shamans still had charm. I died 4 times that night, ick.<br/>
