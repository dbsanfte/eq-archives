&gt; &gt;Emperor Crush - The dude that runs the whole show. If you take him<br/>
&gt; down, you get a real nice piece &gt;of small magical ringmail...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Dwarven Ringmail Tunic)<br/>
<br/>
And he doesn&#39;t have it all the time.  12AC, 4.5 lbs, +8 to<br/>
magic, fire, and cold resist.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Royal Guard - A orc ROGUE if you believe it...I do, because his<br/>
&gt; backstab is brutal<br/>
<br/>
Always carries a bronze weapon.  Sometimes it&#39;s a silly dagger<br/>
that sells for 2 gp, but usually it&#39;s a rapier that sells for<br/>
4pp.  He&#39;s backstabbed me for 82.  Be careful.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lord Darish - Haven&#39;t met up with him often (Even as<br/>
&gt; my level 15 Warrior alter ego) Not sure what &gt;good he is...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe Darish also carries some special axe, although I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; certian. he spawns in the &quot;throne room&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He carries a dwarven axe from time to time.  Nonmagical, but<br/>
6/26 for the one-handed version, which is much better than the<br/>
minotaur axe most people are using by the time they&#39;re able to<br/>
take Darish.  Not sure of the stats on the two-handed version.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  &gt;The Prophet - An oracle on steroids...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The scariest thing is The Prophet does is buff DVinn and Crush with<br/>
&gt; Spirit of the Wolf. I had no idea he was doing this when I&#39;d been to CB<br/>
<br/>
Ah, that explains why Dvinn was able to catch up to me when I<br/>
was running backwards.  :-)  Someone kept letting Dvinn loose<br/>
so I was trying to lead him to my party, but I kept outrunning<br/>
him and losing him if I ran forward; so I tried running<br/>
backwards to keep him in sight, but he kept hitting me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dvinn seems to also have a racial hatred toward Wood Elves, as does Dorn<br/>
&gt; in the 2nd Northern Ro Dervish Camp. Maybe the hatred is toward bards,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m inclined to believe it&#39;s actually Wood Elves. Perhaps all Dark<br/>
<br/>
I think Dorn (and Giz Dinree, next to the Freeport docks) will<br/>
attack you if you follow just about any good diety.  Several<br/>
agnostic folks (all humans) have told me that Dorn does not<br/>
attack them.  Doesn&#39;t matter anymore.  Dorn gets to die just<br/>
about every time I pass by now.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I went to Crushbone the other day at Level 19, and Crushbone was a blue<br/>
&gt; con but to me was like fighting 2 dervish thugs at 17th or 18th, I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t take him alone.<br/>
<br/>
Well the thing about Crush is that everyone wants his tunic,<br/>
so if you start to lose, just drag him into a crowd and<br/>
everyone will jump in trying to steal the kill.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The Prophet was VERY easy to kill.<br/>
<br/>
Depends.  If he or any of the oracles for that matter cast<br/>
walking sleep on you, your attack rate goes way way way down.<br/>
You can still kill him, but if anything else jumps into the<br/>
fight, even if it&#39;s something you could normally take, you<br/>
will have problems.  I wish they had a spell that slowed down<br/>
casting time to slow down all the spellcasting kill stealers<br/>
in Crushbone...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; drop a Shiny Brass Shield (AC10, +10vsMagic, Lightstone)<br/>
<br/>
Camped like you wouldn&#39;t believe.  It is supposed to be<br/>
required for the screaming mace quest, but it isn&#39;t really.<br/>
You need it to prompt the NPC to tell you the next steps to<br/>
complete the quest, but if you already know from word of<br/>
mouth, you can keep the shield and just go on to the other<br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;Taskmaster -<br/>
&gt; Slaver Boss. Has a nice leather whip to reach out and touch someone<br/>
<br/>
Talk to the dwarven smithy slaves.  The taskmaster also<br/>
sometimes has an earring.  Dunno what it does though.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; with...Actually &gt;found behind the castle.&gt;Rondo - Dwarven Bandit found<br/>
&gt; in the mines. He appears to be cooperating with the orcs. Good &gt;reason<br/>
<br/>
I heard a dwarf somewhere in Kaladim wants his tongue.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; There is also a very rare spawn called &quot;the warlord&quot;, he can have a<br/>
&gt; Bracer of Battle. It&#39;s a very good piece of armor I hear in its own<br/>
&gt; right, but you also need it to complete the quest for the screaming<br/>
&gt; mace, along with the shiny brass shield.<br/>
<br/>
I made the mistake of giving the screaming mace to my group&#39;s<br/>
cleric.  She got so giddy about the damage she was doing with<br/>
it that she tried to melee DVinn with us.  Apparently the AI<br/>
is smart enough to try to interrupt spellcasters.  Every time<br/>
she tried to cast a heal spell on one of us, Dvinn would<br/>
immediately turn around and attack her, interrupting her.  She<br/>
and our rogue died, I zoned with one bubble left.  She learned<br/>
her lesson though.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t figured out yet, kill stealing of the higher<br/>
mobs in Crushbone is a problem.  Talk to people, get friendly<br/>
with them, and be nice.  Nothing is funnier than someone<br/>
falsely accusing you of kill stealing (which is another thing<br/>
kill stealers seem to like to do) and to have a half dozen<br/>
people speak up saying how nice a guy you are.  I&#39;ve actually<br/>
given away a dwarven axe, ringmail tunic, and bracer of battle<br/>
to random folks who&#39;ve helped me.  Of course, the notion of<br/>
accusing a bard of kill stealing is rather ridiculous.  If a<br/>
bard can steal your kill, you probably couldn&#39;t have killed it<br/>
by yourself in the first place.  :-)<br/>
