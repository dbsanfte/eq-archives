<div id="ygrps-yiv-938687782">Thank you all for the helpful pause information. Once again this list makes<br/>
playing a bard a pleasure! The information about twisting in the same digest<br/>
was great also. I am glad to read that others don&#39;t switch weapons and<br/>
instruments all the time during a battle. I have tried, but haven&#39;t been able<br/>
to do it. I am still trying to do the instrument switch thingy to be able to<br/>
do instrument only fighting. Sometimes I think I&#39;m just a bit thick for not<br/>
being able to master this so quickly. But when I read other people&#39;s posts, it<br/>
makes me feel a bit better.<br/>
 I thought it might be because I am slower than all you youngsters ( I&#39;m 51),<br/>
but now I see even some really agile younguns have a hard time! Thank you for<br/>
making me feel better:)<br/>
