A Note about Bards <br/>
Keikelajin, of Rodcet Nife, has done a little digging into the promised Bard<br/>
patch and sent me the following report: <br/>
	Update - <br/>
	Bards on the Test Server have reported all the changes that did NOT<br/>
get implemented for the Bard last patch ARE live on the Test Server. Just<br/>
further proof that it was a goof and mum was and is the word. <br/>
