At 45 you can walk around in peace. I dunno about 30. Try it and see, but<br/>
I&#39;d suggest having sow and being cautious. I&#39;m under the impression that if<br/>
you try to fight there you will get jumped by all the gobos, but you might<br/>
be able to walk around. Watch out for evil eyes though, as I think they are<br/>
prolly blue to you and likely to attack.<br/>

Really?  I was under the impression I could even bank there at 30th?  That<br/>
is very different from what I was led to believe.<br/>
