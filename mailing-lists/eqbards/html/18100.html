&gt; Griffenes in NK. I have a couple of questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. I noticed (and assume) that killing Griffawns got the Griffenes to spawn. Are they like Cyclops<br/>
&gt; in the Rather Mtn&#39;s were you have to basically kill everything (bears, etc) to get more to spawn?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. What is a good level to start trying to charm cyclops in the Rathe Mtns? I tried on a yellow and<br/>
&gt; was unsuccessful about 10 times in a row.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; 3. Froon and Choon in WK. Do I have a reasonable shot and charm fighting these 2 against each other?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These 2 were my very first experiment the moment I got the song at level 27 (after trying for 10 minutes<br/>
to get some help to take them out I was just curious if I could get it to stick and was very surprised<br/>
when it did).  Took awhile to finish off the winner, but it fun and I got my lambent vambraces and boots<br/>
out of the deal.  They both were con-red at the time.<br/>
