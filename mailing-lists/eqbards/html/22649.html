<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050096460">I do think it&#39;s pretty interesting that you don&#39;t even play EQ anymore, yet <br/>
are still willing to accommodate all of us EQ devotees. Our Bardic Guiding <br/>
Spirit. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Talies!<br/>

&gt; &gt;It&#39;s found off of Regis, a rare spawn in North Karana. Kill Zahal the Vile<br/>
&gt; &gt;(another rare spawn in North Karana) to make Regis spawn.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The flute is a quest item which you give to the gyspsy, Lianna Ferasa, in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Rathe Mtns in return for the Icon of the Reverent, which is required for<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Cleric&#39;s Bracers of the Reverent quest from the Temple of Solusek Ro.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sorry, never tested it for effects.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also, I may have missed it, but have you included your url for the various<br/>
&gt; &gt;commands? It&#39;s a very handy list that would help with the twisting commands.<br/>
