<div id="ygrps-yiv-351057563">It&#39;s hard to get a group to do this right if they&#39;re a) stupid or b) <br/>
unaware of how it works... so take the time to explain to them.<br/>
<br/>
This song will make critters stop attacking. It doesn&#39;t always work on all <br/>
of them, and it&#39;s pulse-based. So they&#39;ll nod their heads for a few secs, <br/>
then the song pulses again and they&#39;ll nod once again if they fail their <br/>
check. Sometimes they get an attack in, sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
So what you do is the following:<br/>
ALL your group has to target the same critter, you do likewise. Beat the <br/>
crap out of it while playing the Lullaby. You&#39;ll notice they all start <br/>
nodding (hopefully). The ones NOT getting hit will just stand there. The <br/>
one getting hit will get knocked out of lullaby instantly.<br/>
Basically it makes it so a group of monsters can be taken one by one, if <br/>
they&#39;ve all jumped you.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is the ones who aren&#39;t being hit will - if they succeed in <br/>
resisting Lullaby - attack YOU. So be prepared for that. Tell the healer to <br/>
target you, and all should be fine. The other problem is making sure the <br/>
group knows to only attack one monster. This is wise in almost any <br/>
situation, so it&#39;s a good habit to get into.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found this song to be great in Mistmoore. Having a few initiates <br/>
nodding while you pound a glyph or gargoyle is very useful, and as long as <br/>
they&#39;re not crazy high level mobs, the song will work well. I suspect at <br/>
lower levels it&#39;s pretty innefective, but at 21&#39;st I&#39;m starting to use it a <br/>
lot. Pain in the ass explaining it to every new person I group with though <br/>
;P<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not too clear on if it can be twisted effectively though. I suspect it <br/>
can be, I&#39;ve been doing so when the odds aren&#39;t too bad against us. <br/>
Knocking 3 initiates out of the fight for one round every 3 or 4 rounds is <br/>
better than nothing when I can stack it with Anthem and make us all pound <br/>
that one we&#39;re targetting that much more effectively.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think that&#39;s an accurate way of defining this song: it basically <br/>
reduces a group of enemies to 1/4 of their potential (factoring in resists <br/>
and bashes and missed notes and such).<br/>
<br/>
I also find it of great use when I see a low lvl person getting pounded by <br/>
a bunch of critters. Run up to them, hit lullaby and they can basically <br/>
walk away to safety while the group of critters nod like old men.<br/>

 &lt;&lt; File: ATT00007.htm &gt;&gt; Hi fellow mistrels and other friends,<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have never really figured out how to use the lullably song <br/>
correctly.  I wonder if someone could detail a play by play on how it might <br/>
be best used against 3 or 4 creatures my group and myself might encounter. <br/>
 I honestly haven&#39;t seen much effect when I have tried to use it....ok <br/>
things nod but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any other effect.  Also it is an <br/>
area effect right, so do I target a creature, myself, what?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help y&#39;all can give!!!<br/>
<br/>
