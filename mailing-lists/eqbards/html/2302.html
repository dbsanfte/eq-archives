 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t make the original statement, but I&#39;ll tell you why *I* think it is<br/>
too dangerous.  The bard song only affects party members within a certain<br/>
range of the bard.   We&#39;ve all experienced the case where a party member<br/>
gets out of range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando and then falls behind the party.<br/>
Imagine the same thing happening 100 feet underwater.<br/>
<br/>
This is all complicated by the fact that it&#39;s very hard to see underwater,<br/>
and it&#39;s easy to get separated.  Also, people are swimmers of vastly<br/>
differing skills.  My swimming is maxed out from being in the OOT for so<br/>
long.  Other people my level often have swimming skills of 5-10.  Comparing<br/>
my swim speed to theirs is like comparing a jet ski to a flutterboard.<br/>
<br/>
The song is great for a bard solo though.<br/>
