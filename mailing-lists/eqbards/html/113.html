<div id="ygrps-yiv-143577026">I am not a member of their guild, but let&#39;s look at it this way.<br/>
<br/>
In a previous message defending their guild, they said they provide quite a<br/>
few items a newbie could use, like patchwork armor and the first few songs.<br/>
That is probably worth quite a bit right there. Also, they provide a drum at<br/>
5 and a lute at 8. Again, they cost money too. The weekly prize they offer<br/>
(he said it varies but it was a banded tunic the other day) is very<br/>
expensive and time consuming to make (I know since I&#39;m trying to be a smith)<br/>
and to buy it would cost over 10 pp, unless you got lucky. So, I don&#39;t<br/>
really think it&#39;s unreasonable to charge that much since they are buying for<br/>
you many items you would normally have to buy yourself. And the high joining<br/>
fee they have ensures that only people who really want to be in their guild<br/>
join.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, does anyone know how much a guild hall will cost? I&#39;ve heard rumors<br/>
of 10,000 plat to start and some sort of weekly upkeep. This would make<br/>
sense since some of the best armor in the game is in the 1,000 plat range<br/>
and you wouldn&#39;t want a building to be cheaper than armor. heheheh. Any<br/>
other guild aspiring to have a hall needs to keep that in mind before they<br/>
say being a member should be free.<br/>

Hail to all fellow Bards of the relm,<br/>
<br/>
    I would like to take this moment to introduce myself.  I am Phaedrus,<br/>
Half-Elven Bard of Qeynos in the relm of Bertoxxulous.  I would also like to<br/>
thank the greater powers for providing us with this forum so that we may<br/>
discuss matters among our peers.<br/>
<br/>
    I now have just a couple of questions.  First regarding the Soerbaird<br/>
Guild.  I am very proud that members of my calling would have such<br/>
altruistic ideals, but I would like to ask how newer students could afford<br/>
10 PP?  I have just recently achieved the 7th level of ascendance and I<br/>
don&#39;t think I have ever had 10 PP.  Of course money has never been high on<br/>
my list priorities.  I tend to lean toward the virtues of Wine, Women and<br/>
Song.<br/>
<br/>
    I would also like to ask why if we are able to build bows and arrows,<br/>
why are we not able to use them?  One stringed instrument is like another<br/>
after all.<br/>
<br/>
    I look forward to hearing from you all.<br/>
<br/>
Phaedrus<br/>
Half-Elven Bard and bane of all Gnoll Kind.<br/>

&gt;I have personally met Jythri, Ixtlan, and a few other members.  Jythri was<br/>
&gt;excellent company, and offered me help immediatly.  Later, when I needed<br/>
&gt;help and he wasn&#39;t available, a friend of his was more than willing to help<br/>
&gt;me.  Ixtlan, a level 7 bard at the time I believe, took me from Freeport to<br/>
&gt;Halas without charge.  He intended to just come back afterwords too.  That<br/>
&gt;has to be a two hour trip, even with accelerando.  That is what Jythri was<br/>
&gt;talking about.  Shirt off his back!  I can assure you, all other members of<br/>
&gt;the Soerbaird that I met were just as nice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No, I am NOT a Soerbaird member, or am I associated with them in any way,<br/>
&gt;excluding my admiration to their fine group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am proud to know the Soerbaird are out there to lend a helping hand.<br/>
&gt;Good luck!<br/>

&gt;&gt;I appreciate your concern, and I know that ten platinum is a hefty sum.<br/>
&gt;&gt;But, as I responded to you privately, the funds are not misused nor are<br/>
&gt;&gt;they squandered. Running a guild has its expenses, especially if we are to<br/>
&gt;&gt;provide collective services for our bards so that they might carry on<br/>

&gt;&gt;    * A lute at level 8<br/>
&gt;&gt;    * Bi-weekly rewards for the best in-guild ballad or writing. This week<br/>
&gt;&gt;       it was a Banded mail tunic.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, we use the money to pay for other expenses, including:<br/>
&gt;&gt;     * Staff for concerts<br/>
&gt;&gt;     * Saving for a guild hall<br/>
&gt;&gt;     * Prizes for other Soerbaird events<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;We do not use guild money for:<br/>
&gt;&gt;     * Buying better armor or equipment for guild leadership<br/>
&gt;&gt;     * Bribing news sites for better placement<br/>
&gt;&gt;     * Paying necromancers to destory anyone who speaks negatively<br/>
