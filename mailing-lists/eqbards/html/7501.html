<div id="ygrps-yiv-53452049"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;sure dying from an SG or griffin sucks,  but every time you are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>deliberately<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;fighting something, and things go bad, or its really close, or you pulled<br/>
&gt;too much, etc. etc. etc. and you get that excited/scared feeling in your<br/>
&gt;stomach, and your heart starts pounding...<br/>
&gt;think you&#39;ll ever get that with no penalties for dying?  why would you?  no<br/>
&gt;dying penalties=no challenge=no fun.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, yes, I would get that same feeling.  Dying in and of itself is the<br/>
punishment, not to mention having to run back and loot your corpse (which<br/>
still sounds a bit bizarre when trying to explain the game to someone)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is enough of a<br/>
&gt;penalty, thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My point exactly.  Ye olde &quot;LOADING... PLEASE WAIT&quot; sign is more than<br/>
discouraging enough for me.  That coupled with the run back to my corpse is<br/>
enough to keep me wary.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sorry i don&#39;t see the connection.  i advocate not letting melee/hybrid<br/>
&gt;classes to be able to bind, making the game harder.  how does that make it<br/>
&gt;easier to &quot;win&quot; or have anything to do with what you said?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still trying to make the connection of &quot;harder game = more fun&quot;.  If<br/>
that&#39;s the theory, then you must love PoF.  While we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s go<br/>
ahead and raise MOB levels and lower PC levels by 50% across the board.  Oh,<br/>
and don&#39;t forget to lessen the amount of experience you get for killing<br/>
something by 50% too.  Heck, if a harder game is more fun, then let&#39;s get<br/>
rid of Bind Affinity altogether.  Yep, folks will be beating down the doors<br/>
to get EQ then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;no one likes dying, not just some folks.  that&#39;s the point, it is bad to<br/>
&gt;die.  if there were no consequences, there would be no challenge.  is this<br/>
&gt;what you are referring to, my point of the game being a challenge?  this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>has<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;nothing to do with wanting to win, it has only to do with wanting to have<br/>
&gt;fun, and not being bored.  it is after all a game, and if you are not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>having<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;fun, you shouldn&#39;t be playing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Have you ever played a MMORPG that didn&#39;t have such consequences?<br/>
Probably not as there are not many (if any) out there.  If you had, you<br/>
would realize that dying still sucked, but not only did it NOT take away<br/>
from the challenge of the game, but it actually ADDED to the fun.  (yeah,<br/>
yeah... I know.  This is like trying to understand Chinese Algebra.)<br/>
    Actually, I don&#39;t think it would work in EQ.  NWN was a MUCH different<br/>
game, with a different all-around setup.  I DO think it could work in some<br/>
other MMORPG, though.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you want to toss lack of Binding in as a race balancing issue, then<br/>
all classes should be able to bind, or not.  That would be balanced  How is<br/>
it balanced for a mage to be able to bind anywhere in any zone and melee&#39;rs<br/>
not?  If anything, the opposite would be true.  A lot of mage classes can<br/>
teleport (some can also SoW) and therefore cover vast distances much more<br/>
quickly than the poor lumbering melee&#39;r who is forced to run (and slowly at<br/>
that) from Point A to Point B.  Also, all casters need to do to be viable<br/>
for combat (for the most part) is re-mem their spells, and they are good to<br/>
go.  Try being a tank with no weapons or armor.  Where&#39;s the balance there?<br/>
