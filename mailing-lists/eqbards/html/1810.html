<b>Subject:</b> Order of receiving messges on this list (off-topic) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138052400">I was just wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same thing I am on<br/>
this message list when it comes to the order I receive the emails.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that frequently I receive the reply to a post before I<br/>
receive the initial post.  It isn&#39;t that big of a deal but I&#39;m just curious<br/>
if everyone else is experiencing the same thing.  If I&#39;m the only one<br/>
getting the order of messages out of whack, then my email server is most<br/>
likely the culprit.  If it is affecting everyone else then it probably has<br/>
something to do with how Onelist forwards the messages.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a grad student working on my degree in information systems and when I<br/>
can&#39;t figure this kind of stuff out it bugs the crap out of me.  Thanks<br/>
ahead for anyone who can shed some light. <br/>
