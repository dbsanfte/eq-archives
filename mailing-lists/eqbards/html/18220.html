<div id="ygrps-yiv-328861711">The giants also drop some funny weapons like a giant axe that is 45 dam, 150 delay, Orge, Bard, Troll<br/>
warrior only or a sword dam 10 del 42 I believe.  The Brae giants are green at 45 up to the Patriarchs<br/>
and Steaps (sp?) which are blue at 51.  The Brae are pretty easy and make up the bulk of the giants while<br/>
the Patriarchs hit DARN hard and really takes a good party to take out (we had 2 warriors levels 51 and<br/>
46, a 51 shaman with the new slow spell  which works AWESOME, a 45 druid, a 42 rogue and me and we still<br/>
had both warriors under 2 bubbles of health when we got the AC25 tunic).<br/>
<br/>
Of course the REAL good stuff drops on the Pats, but the steaps and brae drop the weapons and tunics that<br/>
you would want to sell to the vendors.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hehe, I had gone back to look at the stats last night so I have them with<br/>
&gt; me.  You&#39;re in luck.  But<br/>
&gt; &gt; first, we mostly did Mountain Giants last night.  We saw a number of new<br/>
&gt; items including a ring AC10 +10<br/>
&gt; &gt; Strength, a tunic called tree weave AC25 +10 strength wearable by just<br/>
&gt; about EVERY class and race except<br/>
&gt; &gt; pure nukers (mages/necros/wiz).  My wife&#39;s warrior got the ring which goes<br/>
&gt; great with her Efreeti ring on<br/>
&gt; &gt; her other hand.  Another warrior got the tunic.  The tunic looks like<br/>
&gt; leather so it is hilareous to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; this warrior running around in all crafted and a leather BP.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The necro stuff is a Flayed Skin Tunic, AC 16 -2 charisma, +5 to all<br/>
&gt; protect,  +20 hp nec and shadow only<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the bracer was AC6 -2 char, +5 int, +5 all prot shadow and necro only<br/>
&gt; I believe.  The key though is<br/>
&gt; &gt; they could not be worn by gnomes or inkies.  I believe they are both<br/>
&gt; human/euradite only.  Both items<br/>
&gt; &gt; were looted almost back to back in Karnor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
