&gt; Bizarre if that is indeed the case it totally invalidates what Brad said at<br/>
&gt; GenCon which was that the easy farming of wisps by level 12-15 melee types<br/>
&gt; was the overlying reason they took out magic glove hitting code for all but<br/>
&gt; monks.  The low cost of other magic weapons like the dirk disaster was what<br/>
&gt; caused wisps to be nerfed even further in their loot with no save<br/>
&gt; lightstones.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is another myth.  Wisp loot was not nerfed.  Unlike most<br/>
people, when I got my first combine weapon, I killed every<br/>
wisp I saw, not just the lighted ones.  I typically got one GL<br/>
per 10 wisps, and one LS per 3-4 wisps.  This ratio did not<br/>
change when the burnt out stones were put in, and I&#39;ve found<br/>
it to still hold true while hunting wisps with my enchanter.  <br/>
Occasionally I&#39;ll get some really lucky or unlucky streaks.  <br/>
I&#39;ve gone an entire day (maybe 50 wisps) with every lightstone<br/>
being burnt ont, and I&#39;ve gotten 5 GLs in 7 wisps.  But the<br/>
overall ratio has remained the same.<br/>
<br/>
As someone else pointed out, the burnt out stones were put in<br/>
so you couldn&#39;t harvest just the wisps with lights.  The only<br/>
people complaining about not getting as many lightstones as<br/>
they used to were the ones who used to only kill the wisps<br/>
with lights.<br/>
<br/>
They *did* nerf the coin loot on the wisps though.  When I<br/>
first hunted them, I made almost half my money off them in<br/>
coin, which was why I killed every one I saw.  Getting 7-8gp<br/>
off one was not uncommon.  Now it&#39;s rare to get more than<br/>
silver from them.<br/>
