<div id="ygrps-yiv-453298321">Make sure that you have the latest version of DirectX - 7.0 seems to work fine.<br/>
The strange sound effects seem to be something related to Soundblasters - <br/>
mine does that all the time, and I heard about it a lot while Guiding.  You <br/>
might also check to make sure that you have the latest drivers from <br/>
Creative Labs.<br/>

As to leaving, well, I have to stand up for my beliefs.  I find it rather <br/>
ironic that one of the last statements I made to my former server GM was <br/>
&quot;For the love of god, hire a real PR man.  Abashi is the worst thing to <br/>
happen to Verant because of his unswerving attitudes.  You have to be <br/>
willing to admit you make mistakes, or the public will instinctively <br/>
mistrust you.&quot;<br/>

Heh - I guess it worked ;)<br/>
