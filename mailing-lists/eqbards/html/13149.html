<br/>
High level giants (ice and fire in Perma/SolB) cannot be<br/>
mesmerized.<br/>
<br/>
A L50 enchanter enlightened me to this fact after I spent the<br/>
better part of an hour trying to figure out why Pixie Strike<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to be working (no resist message, eyes glaze over,<br/>
but no effect - sound familiar?).  (Unfortunately, she didn&#39;t<br/>
join us until after the hour.)<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean for the bard?  It means in a multi-giant<br/>
pull, if your group(s) does the everyone-attack-one-mob<br/>
strategy, ALL the extra giants will be attacking THE BARD<br/>
after a couple rounds.  I think I sucked up about 75% of the<br/>
heals, just like old days with Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t get a chance to try varying strategies, but I<br/>
suspect having one tank (someone with parry and riposte) per<br/>
extra giant would save the clerics a lot of mana.  Another<br/>
option may be rooting the extras some distance away (assuming<br/>
they can be rooted).<br/>
