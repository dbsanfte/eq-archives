<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522000718">My problem with this explanation is that most other changes like this to<br/>
were done just to the PvP servers, not every server. Why was this done<br/>
to all the servers to address a problem specific to the PvP servers?<br/>

&gt; The change was made for a very specific reason, and in some ways I support<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Primarily it was this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Caster A who is low on mana would bind himself.<br/>
&gt; Caster A, not wanting to wait the 5 min to med to full (or whatever it is)<br/>
&gt; would duel Friend B.<br/>
&gt; Caster A would lose, loot corpse, mem spells and Voila, full mana.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was an exploit to reduce down time, since dying in PvP incurrs no exp<br/>
&gt; loss.<br/>
