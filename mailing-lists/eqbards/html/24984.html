<br/>
Seriously though, only thing I could think of is that Tizmak. Looks nice <br/>
and is relatively cheap.<br/>

&gt;wicker... hey, she&#39;s only level 10. Got the green pants and<br/>
&gt;sleeves, rest is brown, no hat. Several people have complimented<br/>
&gt;me on the look. Dunno what I&#39;ll do when I get higher since I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t stand the look of banded on a human (or just about any<br/>
&gt;female for that matter), bronze weighs a ton, and waiting until I<br/>
&gt;can get my lambent is an awfully long time to be wearing leather<br/>
&gt;even if it does look good. But after spending about 15 levels in<br/>
&gt;banded with my cleric (she&#39;s now 29 and working on quests for the<br/>
&gt;nice gold plate), I never want to look like a swimsuit model<br/>
&gt;again. Suggestions on good looking and relatively cheap gear for<br/>
&gt;an low level bard? (besides twinking. The poor cleric&#39;s broke as<br/>
&gt;it is, and I&#39;m not too fond of twinking anyway.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I liked the color on lambent, especially when I had a mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt; full suit on.<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I started getting imbrued though, it didn&#39;t look as good.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then I got<br/>
&gt; &gt; some kylong, and a hero bracer, and it was commented on several<br/>
&gt; &gt; times that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was really multicolored. Now I have managed to go mostly green,<br/>
&gt; &gt; between SS<br/>
&gt; &gt; and dragon stuff from WW. Still have my silver helm (I love my<br/>
&gt; &gt; hammerhead<br/>
&gt; &gt; bucket!) and my imbrued boots to break the monotony of all<br/>
&gt; &gt; green and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; keeps me from looking like a ranger! I prefer green overall and<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; &gt; any major fashion shifts in the near future.<br/>
