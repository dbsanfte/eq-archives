<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124633545">This only fits part of the puzzle though.  It does not explain why you&#39;d lose more of level 30 when you<br/>
die after JUST reaching 31, then you do if you simply die at level 30.<br/>

&gt; Some of the people who run ShowEQ have been trying to come up with an<br/>
&gt; experience formula.  They have come up with some formulas that<br/>
&gt; explain much of the hell level and hell level +1 effects.  Based on their<br/>
&gt; formulas (which are only a guess) I think the difference in experience loss<br/>
&gt; can be explained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; lvl, exp needed, exp lost  (examples made up)<br/>
&gt; --------------------<br/>
&gt; lvl 29    5000    500<br/>
&gt; lvl 30    10000   500<br/>
&gt; lvl 31    2500    500<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you can see, the experience lost is linear, while the exp needed for hell<br/>
&gt; level takes a big jump, and there is a dip afterwards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A death at 29 costs you half a bubble.<br/>
&gt; A death at 30 costs you a quarter of a bubble.<br/>
&gt; A death at 31 costs you a full bubble.<br/>
&gt; But the total experience loss is the same in each case.<br/>
&gt; (based on the made of example above)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since experience for HL+1 is so much less than HL, the same amount of<br/>
&gt; experience loss will result in a bigger percentage of the bar.  You are not<br/>
&gt; really losing that much more experience numerically, but just graphically.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can test this yourself by measuring how long it takes to make up from a<br/>
&gt; death in HL vs HL+1.  The time to regain the lost experience should be<br/>
&gt; roughly equal, therefore the loss is roughly equal.  Your bar dropped more<br/>
&gt; in HL+1, but you regain it faster.<br/>
