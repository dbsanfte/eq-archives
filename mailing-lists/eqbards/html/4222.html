<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418389719">I&#39;m going to join the flame list and say that I agree with Bob.  I receive over<br/>
200 messages a day from several mailing lists, family, friends.  I don&#39;t have<br/>
any idea what most of these acronyms are and when I find them in a message I am<br/>
curious as to what they mean, but as before mentioned, I still have 200 or more<br/>
messages to read.  This leaves me little time to reply to people, let alone go<br/>
to a web site with an EverQuest dictionary.  Nor do I contain any desire to go<br/>
there and look up a word each time.<br/>
     Here&#39;s a good one for you, everyone pretty much knows what a zipper is, or<br/>
has one on a least one article of clothing, but when i told my 10 year old<br/>
nephew to XYZ-PDQ he had no clue what I was talking about.  In other words,<br/>
just because I play the game doesn&#39;t mean I know every piece of language and<br/>
lore about it, nor do I care to.<br/>
     But it would be nice if people would just spell out what it is they are<br/>
talking about, it would make me more interested in the messages that contain<br/>
these acronyms.<br/>

p.s. I DO know what FBR is...Full Black Robe.  But I guess that is just because<br/>
for the last 5 days some idiot has been screaming it across east karana, and<br/>
each time he does some person new to the area, generally barbarians, will shout<br/>
back...&quot;What is a FBR?&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ah! You just need the secret decoder ring. Here ya go:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry, wrong answer.  Doesn&#39;t scale.  Barely works at all.  Using acronyms<br/>
&gt; that aren&#39;t widely known is inconsiderate of those with whom you are<br/>
&gt; supposedly trying to communicate.  Pointing people to an immense list of<br/>
&gt; definitions is simply a way of saying you can&#39;t be bothered to type out<br/>
&gt; words that would be relatively sufficient.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM systems difficult<br/>
&gt; and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>
&gt; companies moved away from secret code.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Acronyms are the rudest form of slang and jargon.  They are even worse than<br/>
&gt; obscure words like &quot;proc&quot; because they aren&#39;t even pronouncable words.<br/>
&gt; Acronyms are effectively a way to invent new words on the fly, then use<br/>
&gt; them and berate the reader for not knowing what they mean.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll warn you now that I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the computer<br/>
&gt; industry for 30 years, with some success.  People either get the point and<br/>
&gt; behave less rudely or miss the point and continue to speak in secret code,<br/>
&gt; either not understanding or simply not caring whether they&#39;re communicating<br/>
&gt; with the majority of their audience.  If you don&#39;t mind if the majority of<br/>
&gt; the readers simply don&#39;t know what you meant and probably won&#39;t bother to<br/>
&gt; find out, use them, but don&#39;t kid yourself.<br/>
