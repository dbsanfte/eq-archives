<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776838017">We went to City of Mist the first few nights of Kunark and it was great fun.  We eventually got 4 groups in the city and were using AE to pull stuff from the first level Lord&#39;s temple.  Sometimes too many reavers would smoosh us but other times we could deal with them and get the Lord.  We have a pile of jade Reavers, the Thornblades, and the other one I mentioned in my eariler post.  We did see a single reaver, respawn reaver, respawn reaver, then spawn Lord.  There are 2 Lords that I have heard casting and we eventually them both (iirc).  <br/>

I looted an Ancient Coin off the Captain of the Guards.  Later talked to the male banker and heard about his coin collection.  I guess if you give him a Star of Odus (buy in Erud for 120pp about) he gives you a 4 slot box and asks you to fill it with 6 coins (is it just me or are these quests getting harder?) Anyhow he says he will give you something a &quot;composer&quot; left with him - sounds like he is hinting at a bard item.<br/>
<br/>
Later on I got another Ancient Coin off bloodfrienzed goblin in Lake of Ill Omen (they would not pull to shore but they did pull nicely to the partially submerged platform between the columns.  And there seems to be a not yet open zone portal at the bottom of the lake.  Kedge II, Phinnie&#39;s Revenge?  Going to be looking for the other coins.<br/>
<br/>
We had some fun in Burining Wood - full group - all 50-52.  Pulling more or less non-stop.  Look a 51 Gullerback (sp?), let&#39;s charm him... So, our necro charms him and he makes a good pet: Gullerback_08 says, &quot;You will not evade me Wurm_18!&quot;  Heh, pets that summon.  <br/>

Ended the weekend in Befallen. Delivered a set of gnome picks to one of our rogues. She was picking madly to get 200 and at 1.30am when I woke up from a short nap while singing elergy for her, she was still at 197 - ugh.  Those last few points are extremely hard I guess.  Anyone know if there are any better doors that the Befallen ones?<br/>

p.s. got to remember to bring some CPA (Cabby Pale Ale) back to the drunks by the bard merch in FV.  Does it bother any one else to see that fem Barb do the bard animation? And the oger?  Well, ogers are down right rude.<br/>
