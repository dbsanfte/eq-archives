<div id="ygrps-yiv-353352688">I paid 5 pp for the foraged one (The guy said to give him whatever.. <br/>
I felt like a cheapskate, but it was all the money I had in the world <br/>
at the time.. I&#39;ll probably find him and give him some more money at <br/>
some point) and 50 pp for the coin in Kaesora.  The guy in Kaesora <br/>
was very helpful in telling me how difficult it would be to get the <br/>
coins and (from what he said) that specific coin was pretty rare, so <br/>
I felt it was worth more.  The one&#39;s in Dalnir I got for free.<br/>
<br/>
Prices could vary tremendously, I imagine, but remember that the <br/>
person you&#39;re dealing with can not complete the quest (unless they <br/>
are a Bard, have a Bard, or know a Bard).  I always offer to pay in <br/>
my shout to the zone and then leave it up to the person who offers to <br/>
decide how much they want for it.  Most people don&#39;t know what <br/>
they&#39;re for and are actually happy to give it away for free when you <br/>
tell them (MENTION THAT IT&#39;S NO DROP!!!!).  And most people would <br/>
have destroyed it anyway, so ANY money is more than they&#39;d get <br/>
otherwise.<br/>
