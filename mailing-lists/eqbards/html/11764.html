<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354605411">Ok, so there I was in NK with nothing to do when I sees a Griffon.  Then I<br/>
sees another Girffon.  Hmm, well I can just zone if it goes bad.  So, I<br/>
target one and equip crude stein and sing charm:<br/>

Ruh roh!  Time to start moving.  So then as I am heading to the Plains of<br/>
the Western Karana, I sees old Guard Frederick killing some corrupt lion and<br/>
I train Merv onto poor old Guard Fred.  Well, old Fred starts whacking on<br/>
Merv but Merv don&#39;t care about some lame greenie whacking at him and keeps<br/>
chasing me.  So, I just keep on kiting and eventually Fred nibbles him down<br/>
and KS&#39;s him off me.  <br/>
<br/>
So now I am thinking, hmmm, I bet I could do this with a party member and we<br/>
would get he kill and the xp??? Might have to try it sometime.  I think that<br/>
Merv might view things a little differently if a party member is slashing<br/>
his tail feathers or not?  Or charm Fred when he has Merv down to low health<br/>
- I guess that would have worked too.  I was in a risk adverse mood right<br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
The day before - we tried to take a SG in S. Ro (we were after Kililji<br/>
plans.)  A lo 30&#39;s bard and a lo 30&#39;s necro and me at 38.  Well, things got<br/>
all messed up and I was beat down to low hp and the other bard got killed<br/>
and I was running for the zone.  For some reason, pathing problem or what<br/>
not, the SG got a free tele port right to me from half way across the zone.<br/>
Hit, hit, dead. Ugh.<br/>

p.s. ya, I know I had been warned!  But sheesh!</div>
