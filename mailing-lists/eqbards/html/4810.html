certainly upgraded the bard, and was a good way to keep<br/>
multiple mobs off the clerics (for those who haven&#39;t seen this<br/>
problem, if all the tanks are beating up one mob and the<br/>
cleric heals someone, all the mobs that aren&#39;t being beat up<br/>
go after the cleric *unless* there&#39;s someone like a bard<br/>
who&#39;ve been using an area effect to make those mobs hate him<br/>
more).  But I never successfully used Lullaby to pull a mob<br/>
that someone had soloed to almost-dead.<br/>
<br/>
Pixie Strike is reputed to clear the hate list too.  My<br/>
experience has been that it hasn&#39;t, but twice it *may* have.<br/>
The first time I was playing around with death beetles and had<br/>
just hit one with strike when I had to run to help some<br/>
friends.  The beetle never &quot;caught up&quot; to me later.  The<br/>
second time, I&#39;d used it on a mob I&#39;d 80% killed.  Someone<br/>
else finished the mob off and got the experience.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to stop short of agreeing with you until I see how<br/>
the level 35 song works.  It supposedly drains mana.  If it<br/>
works like the other debuffs, it shouldn&#39;t interfere with<br/>
mesmerize.  So you should be able to hit a caster with Pixie<br/>
Strike and drain their mana without them ever waking up.<br/>
