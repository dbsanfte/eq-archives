<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378929848"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I found what is probably an &quot;unintended bard nerf&quot; that seems to be<br/>
specifically related to bards.<br/>

It&#39;s a bug.  I&#39;ve just lifted this from everlore.com:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When you added the patch to make it so that the / commands could not be<br/>
used dureing inappropiate times you made it so that the /command could not<br/>
be activated while a bard song is playing even if the ability such as forage<br/>
should be ablde to be activated at that time also the new /pause command<br/>
will not work either. while i think this command would be great for the<br/>
bards never ending quest to fight TCS. The fact that it does not work for us<br/>
is more then a little sadding for me please look into this.<br/>
<br/>
Rowyl&#39;s response:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a mistake on my part that the new (and some old) / commands don&#39;t work<br/>
for Bards when singing. I plan to fix it.<br/>
