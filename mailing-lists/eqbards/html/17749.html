lava pool (therefore not being able to surface).  Why it hasn&#39;t been fixed<br/>
is beyond me, it would certainly take a load off the guides&#39; time.<br/>

Another bug to watch out for (obviously not for a while for some) occurs<br/>
in Kedge.  While fighting, if something gets knocked into the ceiling or a<br/>
wall, it will often teleport back to it&#39;s spawn point.  Twice now I&#39;ve<br/>
been the victim of a teleporting Swirlspine Guardian, who subsequently<br/>
started summoning people directly into Phinigel&#39;s lair.  Not a fun thing,<br/>
by any means.<br/>

P.s. Hello to Phreekitty, and an excellent job on your Kedge guide.  I&#39;m<br/>
about halfway through reading it. :)   (gameznet.com/eq, aka EQlizer)</div>
