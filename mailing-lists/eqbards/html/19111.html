<div id="ygrps-yiv-685380685">I cannot say this too many times.  Lake of Ill Omen.  This place is awesome<br/>
for xp from 24 to 29th at least.  Most of my guild is here on E&#39;ci now, at<br/>
least those in this level range.  They are getting 3 bubbles a night and<br/>
they are all casual players who play less than 4 hours per night.  Goblin<br/>
warriors, goblin warlords, sarnak recruits, and charbone and icebone<br/>
skeletons are their mane fare.<br/>

Snip: If you need to convince yourself to go to kunark, talk to me.   <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I am talking to you Matt.  I am on my way to Kunark tonight.  I <br/>
have heard good things about a few zones.  I am currently less than 2 <br/>
bubbles from 27.  Where are some good places to go?  I want Charm and <br/>
Pixie&#39;s!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
