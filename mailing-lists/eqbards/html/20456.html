<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-39470188">For a long long time now I&#39;ve never used Pixie Strike despite people<br/>
on here apparently having much more success than I ever did.  Constant<br/>
resists made it pretty ineffective in my eyes, and yes I do have a<br/>
high cha boosted by all and sundry.  Still appeared unreliable to me.<br/>
<br/>
When casters came along, I&#39;ve tended to boost resists on the party and<br/>
just let the casters in our group zap them to little pieces faster<br/>
than they kill us.  There&#39;s something satisfying about watching a big<br/>
bad something zap one of my party members with something nasty and see<br/>
not even a sliver of health go down.<br/>
<br/>
My own crowd control is usually charm above everything else since it&#39;s<br/>
the only one that&#39;s reliable, although after exploring my young<br/>
enchantress I see now how much more limited it is, and I&#39;m thankful<br/>
for all that nice blue armour!<br/>

&gt;couple of weeks ago that were pretty high level on the North Wall of Karnor.<br/>
&gt;I replaced an enchanter - they had no probs with 3-pulls.  I tried pixie<br/>
&gt;strike to alternate between the two &quot;extras&quot; and tried to keep them both<br/>
&gt;mezzed.  The resists made it useless.  The Paladin Died and the rogue and I<br/>
&gt;zoned into Karnors (The Rogue&#39;s primary was a +49 Cleric so it was no big<br/>
&gt;woop).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was 44 at the time - and there&#39;s nothing above a blue (although I think it<br/>
&gt;was &quot;High-Blue&#39;s&quot; I was trying to mez if that makes a difference).  I WAS<br/>
&gt;using my Mino Horn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do believe (but not sure) there was no secondary resist message...<br/>
