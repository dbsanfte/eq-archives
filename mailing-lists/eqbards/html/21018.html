<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016613523">I always grab SoW if I can, while soloing or grouping.  It frees an extra<br/>
song in the rotation and is always on, rather than having to start it up<br/>
while being pummelled.  Once you hit 46, you can kill even faster by<br/>
twisting the 3 dots with SoW.  One caveat, you require more kiting room<br/>
using SoW instead of Chains.  And if there&#39;s multiple mobs, I will always<br/>
charm 1, rather than kite them both.  I find this much more &quot;fun&quot; and I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure it&#39;s faster, too.  In fact, if I&#39;m kiting, I might look for a<br/>
2nd mob just to cut down on the tedium. :p<br/>

The one AC I helped kill, there was no question the ring went to my GF&#39;s<br/>
Mage. :)  Tho, I have to ask her to remove Jboots when we&#39;re traveling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
