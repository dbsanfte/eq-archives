<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284801545">well with us it merely depends on how many points you have in our loot<br/>
system.  last night a bard got a white scale off gorenaire and a warrior got<br/>
a red scale off talendor.  i&#39;m in no rush to get one, the pieces will come<br/>
as they come.<br/>

p.s. i got the killing blow on VS once, but not Trak... yet =p<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lots and lots of Warriors on Bertox but very few Bards.  I <br/>
&gt; think I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; about a ten or so post-50.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could see Prophecy doing it *easily*, but if they&#39;re smart, <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll outfit<br/>
&gt; their warriors first.  And before I&#39;m flamed for not <br/>
&gt; supporting my fellow<br/>
&gt; Bards... in a group/raid situation, the Warrior quest weapon <br/>
&gt; is going to be<br/>
&gt; far more useful than the Singing Short Sword.  Our primary <br/>
&gt; function at those<br/>
&gt; events is resists/mana/regen.  When was the last time you saw <br/>
&gt; a Bard wading<br/>
&gt; in and delivering the killing blow to Trak? ;) </span></blockquote></div>
