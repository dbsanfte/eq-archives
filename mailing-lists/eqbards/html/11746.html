<br/>
On Saturday night, I woke up camped at Mistmoore.  I had spent a long<br/>
time the previous weekend waiting for gloves that never showed up, and<br/>
figured I would stick my head inside to see if I could get lucky.  I<br/>
zoned in, and what did I see at the top of the ramp but a named Gypsy<br/>
carrying a Lute (and her pet).  She conned blue to me.  Now, I wasn&#39;t<br/>
prepared to whack a blue and a pet, so I /ooc&#39;ed to ask if anyone would<br/>
be willing to help me out.  As she started to leave, two guys showed up<br/>
and started to hit her.  &quot;Great!&quot;, I figured, here&#39;s the help I asked<br/>
for, so I piled on.  Through some miracle, I actually got the<br/>
experience, and looted the Lute of the Gypsy Princess.  This is cool, of<br/>
course, but not particularly useful - I had really wanted the Gypsy Lute<br/>
for my armor - but, as a Bard, I was very happy to get it.<br/>
<br/>
I did /tells to both of the others to thank them.  One sent back a short<br/>
grumble, the other said, essentially, &quot;Sure, anytime you want me to do<br/>
damage to something so you can KS it from me, just ask.&quot;  Apparently<br/>
they weren&#39;t responding to my /ooc.  After some /tells back and forth, I<br/>
determined that they had been camping the music room for four hours,<br/>
their group had just been trashed, and the two of them had gone back<br/>
into MM to get the Lute that they knew was at the top.<br/>
<br/>
So what do I do?  I gave him the Lute.  Kind of a bummer, I go from<br/>
being really elated at my extraordinary stroke of fortune to being<br/>
depressed at being thought of as a KSer, but it seemed the honorable<br/>
thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;m wandering away, I get a /tell from the guild leader of their<br/>
guild, who was a member of the group they were in.  He tells me to come<br/>
back; they were retaking the music room and, in thanks for my<br/>
consideration, he intended to have them give me the first lute that they<br/>
found.  And they did!  Not only that, but it was the Gypsy Lute that I<br/>
had really wanted anyway!  Sometimes life makes you smile, after all.<br/>
;)<br/>
