<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042491148">Hello friends,<br/>
<br/>
As a fellow bard I am faced with a great duel in less than a months time.<br/>
This duel will be fought between a level 30-33 bard and a similarly<br/>
leveled ranger.  From what I have read on the groups most of the dueling<br/>
results have been for extremely high level people like Shada and a few<br/>
lower level duels.  What I am looking for is some sort of tactics to be<br/>
used in the battle.  <br/>
<br/>
Please understand that the ranger I will be facing will be wielding many<br/>
items that are above her level like Raincaller, Short Sword of Morin, and<br/>
Thulian Bladed Claw.<br/>
<br/>
Also some thoughts... am I expected to lose?<br/>
