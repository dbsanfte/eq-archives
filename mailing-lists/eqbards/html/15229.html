<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239970917">Best way to do this is to do an average dmg over time.  Try it both ways and<br/>
determine which way works best for you.  I personally use a Staff of<br/>
Writhing and Gnoll Hide Lariet....  I&#39;m hell on casters because if we run<br/>
into one I volley-fire pixie strike at them (rarely does a casting npc get<br/>
off more than 1 or 2 spells in a battle with me doing that).  The stun<br/>
effect of the whip is nice and the staff does a lot of dmg by itself so<br/>
together they work out to be an ok combination.  If I&#39;m going for raw dmg I<br/>
throw in my Silvery Axe instead of the lariet.<br/>
<br/>
But I think, in your case, you&#39;d be better off with the Shard in your<br/>
offhand.  Bottom line:  The axe is going to net you a lot more dmg because<br/>
of its shorter delay.  In combat I&#39;ve found that weapons just don&#39;t proc<br/>
enough for the effect to outweigh a 3-4 point speed advantage (dmg being<br/>
equal).<br/>
<br/>
Hard to tell without doing any comparisons though.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I know that you want to keep your best weapon in the primary hand, but<br/>
how do you apply that rule when<br/>
&gt; one weapon has an effect. I have a silvery war axe and an Obsidian Shard.<br/>
Both have damage 6. However,<br/>
&gt; the shard has a longer delay and an effect and the axe has a shorter<br/>
delay. Which is better in the<br/>
&gt; primary? My uderstanding of how the effect works is that if I putt it in<br/>
the secondary hand, the effect<br/>
&gt; roll will only happen when the duel wield goes off.<br/>
