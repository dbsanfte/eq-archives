I&#39;ve been twisting songs ever since I got Hymn of Restoration. It really<br/>
comes in handy when you start to get into trouble in a fight and you can<br/>
twist Hymn with Chant of Battle or Jonathon&#39;s Whistling Warsong. Now that<br/>
you have Boastful Bellow, you really need to start twisting that with Anthem<br/>
De Arms or Hymn, whichever the situation. Start out twisting Bellow with<br/>
Anthem, then if your hitpoints start getting low, twist Bellow with Hymn,<br/>
and throw Anthem in there just for good measure if you can.<br/>

Maybe I&#39;ll try pottery to make some extra money. I&#39;ve been doing brewing for<br/>
awhile, and that you can maybe make 5-10pp in an hour, and it gets very<br/>
tedious. Its not really practical for me to go to Halas right now, I&#39;m in<br/>
Freeport. Where is a good place to do pottery on the eastern coast of<br/>
Antonica or anywhere on Faydwer? Also, where can I get the book on pottery?<br/>
