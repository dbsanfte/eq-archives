<div id="ygrps-yiv-705410149">I&#39;m not sure what the room is called, as I far as I was aware it was called<br/>
the assassin room, but another named mob spawns there too, not sure what he<br/>
was called as I elected not to roll as I was getting the mask. But the<br/>
assassin is in the room at the top of a ladder, I found it quite easy to<br/>
get there, as long as you can grab an invis vs undead it takes 2 minutes to<br/>
get there from the zone (avoid the bats, they see thru invis-undead).<br/>
<br/>
The people in my group thought I was a nutter going that far into lower guk<br/>
at level 30, but the group I was in was brilliant and I rarely dropped<br/>
below half health.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  What room John ? Moonflower spent 7 hours shuttling back and forth<br/>
between groups holding something called the &quot;Cav&quot; room, the &quot;Sage&quot; room<br/>
and the &quot;Executioner&quot; room. Here is the bad part. The Assassin was<br/>
killed once the entire time. Someone shouted &quot;Mask&quot; and because I was<br/>
the only one there that could use it they told me to loot it. So I am<br/>
standing over the body going click, click, click when suddenly i get the<br/>
message &quot;Someone is already looting that body&quot; ...POOF !!!  Nobody would<br/>
own up and all agreed &quot;That was dirty. The Mask was Moon&#39;s&quot;. The<br/>
Assassin was never seen again and later some one opined &quot;The assassin<br/>
spawns up the stairs&quot;. Hunh ? ...any ideas because just being in lower<br/>
Guk gives me sweaty palms :) I died just getting to the rooms when the<br/>
person who was leading me in had her invisibility to the dead go down<br/>
right in the middle of a pack of Greater Ice Bones. When Moon saw that<br/>
she calmly walked to the middle of the floor of a tower where she would<br/>
be easy to see and knelt down and bowed her head. It took only one round<br/>
and wasn&#39;t very painful, really :)<br/>
  This was also my first experience sing my new Clarity song. I finally<br/>
met someone I had only read about here ! You know, the guy who tells you<br/>
what to do. He insisted I couldn&#39;t weave Clarity with anything else. I<br/>
explained, while I might not be able to weave 3 songs with it I<br/>
certainly could 2 and cited this board and John Kim, et al as my<br/>
authority. Heheh, all night long I am sill getting group tells &quot;Is that<br/>
a Heal song I see !&quot; ..got so bad I started slipping in Fulfils Chant<br/>
and Chains below his radar to help the group. They really love their<br/>
Clarity song don&#39;t they :)<br/>
