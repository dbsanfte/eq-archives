<div id="ygrps-yiv-563565643"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Grrr.  The increase in effectiveness is entirely due to number<br/>
&gt; of mobs.  It&#39;s just nicer to have more party members because<br/>
&gt; that increases your survivability, which is true anyway<br/>
&gt; regardless of Psalm.  Having more party members actually makes<br/>
&gt; Psalm account for a smaller percentage of the total damage<br/>
&gt; applied to the mobs - the mobs die quicker so they have less<br/>
&gt; time to beat themselves against your damage shields.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That is the issue I missed before.  More players brings more<br/>
  collective hp to the table, thus you can balance dmg to players.<br/>
  But as for Psalm, it&#39;s dmg ratio then decreases as more people<br/>
  beat down the multiple enemies.  So is the 5,6,7,8 dmg to each<br/>
  mobs contact swing better than the bard with a lute and hymm<br/>
  with some form of speed up attack in a big party?  Despite the<br/>
  fact healing will draw frenzy on the bard from mobs not being<br/>
  detained.<br/>
<br/>
  I think you have different scenarios based on number of players.<br/>
  A full group would most likely benefit from atkspeed/ac/healing<br/>
  than trying to weave in a dmg shield from psalm.  Still, it is<br/>
  possible in best case to weave all of these songs together.  I&#39;m<br/>
  just trying to be realistic in these days of lag and other bard<br/>
  song enemies.  keeping 3 songs steady is getting tougher.  All<br/>
  effects have to be off, the more mobs - the more polys to render,<br/>
  the servers are getting much more laggy due to connectivity, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  Assuming multiple encounters:<br/>
<br/>
  Soloing melee - Psalm make work out beter.<br/>
  Soloing magic - AE DoT damage songs with instruments are awesome.<br/>
  <br/>
  Small Party melee/magic - John&#39;s formulas.<br/>
<br/>
  Large Party melee/magic - Full atkspeed,healing,utility (protect/mana)<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
