If you jump off a 10 story building you will die.  That is not a fact.<br/>
<br/>
You are the only person I know who does not know the difference between a<br/>
fact and an opinion. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe Bards eventually become better than Shamans in melee, but not at level<br/>
17.  Dual wield was not sufficient to prevent me from being pummeled due to<br/>
the numerous stuns I received.  All shamans have slam.  Sure it never goes<br/>
up, but it is still sufficient to stun a 17th level bard.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are better than all hybrids in magical power?  Under what microscope<br/>
did you determine that?  At lower levels its obviously true as the other<br/>
hybrids have no magical power.  Hmm lets examine them at higher levels.<br/>
Paladin get Greater Heal, 400 hp that&#39;s 3 minutes worth of Hymn with a lute<br/>
and it takes them less time than that to meditate back the mana.  They also<br/>
get Revive at their utmost level of spell use.  Not to mention Lay Hands.<br/>
Rangers probably have the weakest line of spells getting nothing above Heal,<br/>
though they do get Wolf Form, cool but not overly powerful.  Shadowknights<br/>
spells are fearsome.  The Engulfing Darkness DoT line is devastating as it<br/>
destroys our best defense, Acellerando and it stacks with their Heat Blood.<br/>
They also now have the lifetap series.  All this aside their Harm Touch<br/>
alone is a devastating if slow to recharge weapon.  We do have a greater<br/>
number of spells than the other hybrids do though.  Are our abilities<br/>
obviously better, I would not say so.  Better in a full group of six maybe,<br/>
better in small groups, that&#39;s not apparent.  Even if we were better it<br/>
certainly would not be 5-6 times better and that&#39;s how the other hybrids<br/>
relate to us in terms of melee skills.  <br/>
<br/>
Now since I have stated that bards magical abilities might not be so much<br/>
better than some of the other hybrids, rangers excluded as their spells are<br/>
truly weak, feel free to call me a liar.  That will just be one more<br/>
definition you will need to look up on Merriam-Webster Online, right after<br/>
&#39;fact&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
To further turn your argument around: <br/>
Bards cannot beat any caster consistently in pure magical combat. (though<br/>
I&#39;ve come close with Maxell MR)<br/>
Bards cannot beat any other hybrid or melee type consistently in pure melee<br/>
combat.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those statements however true prove we are weaker than those<br/>
classes any more than yours prove we are equal in power.  In my opinion, we<br/>
are weaker than several of the other classes.  The weakness is not generally<br/>
overbearing but that doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be corrected.  To be honest I<br/>
think a realignment of our skills would suffice to bridge the gap without<br/>
modifications to our spells other than including the missing ones and fixing<br/>
the broken ones.  An added melee skill like Parry which succeeds more often<br/>
than Dodge, and some raised caps on skills that are currently of debatable<br/>
usefulness would help as well.  Most Jack-of-all-trades are seen as<br/>
self-sufficient characters while we are definitely not designed to be very<br/>
capable on our own.  We do best in groups due to the nature of our spells.<br/>
It is this very grouping nature that further undermines the usefulness of<br/>
our other skills as there will often be present others in the group whose<br/>
skill so far overshadows ours in those other areas that we might as well not<br/>
have the skill at all. There is no benefit to having Find Traps and Pick<br/>
Locks when there is a rogue in the group with more than double your skill.<br/>
If we were meant to be characters who could function on their own and do<br/>
nearly everything, if not well, that would be different.  However, we are<br/>
not.  We are meant to group and for every member we add to our group some of<br/>
our skills become superfluous just as our magical powers become more potent.<br/>

1. Bards are better than all Pure Casters and Priests in melee. (MAG, WIZ,<br/>
ENC, NEC, CLR, SHA, DRU)<br/>
2. Bards are better than all hybrids in magical power. (PAL, RNG, SK)<br/>
<br/>
The above statements are facts and cannot be disputed.  Every Bard should<br/>
understand these facts.<br/>
<br/>
If someone tries to contradict one of the above statements, I will point<br/>
them out as a liar.  Especially to those Bards who have been on this list<br/>
quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to the nature of my messages, in the past I have made some poor choices.<br/>
But I&#39;ve tried to do better.  I looked at my last five messages and saw<br/>
nothing out of the ordinary.  I&#39;d be glad to discuss any of my posts with<br/>
you or anyone else in private, not on the list.<br/>

&gt;     Just curious, what server do you play on and do you play a bard?  The<br/>
&gt; reason I ask is because you emails are consistently sniping in nature and<br/>
&gt; generally flamebait.  I&#39;ll be the first to defend your right to free<br/>
