<div id="ygrps-yiv-816509622"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Actually, if you check Verant&#39;s help wanted section, I think it can be<br/>
&gt; inferred pretty positively that they are running on Unix, Solaris to be<br/>
&gt; exact. There&#39;s a job posting for a Sr Sysadmin there who&#39;s duty is to run<br/>
&gt; the game servers. 2-4 years Unix required. Some NT preferred. Some<br/>
&gt; Oracle. From that, my best guess would be world servers on Unix, Oracle<br/>
&gt; for the login/accounting server. Did DikuMud have it&#39;s own built in<br/>
&gt; database?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Hot damn, I need a new job where they do nothing, heh.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s all I do everyday, Solaris + Oracle + Web Programming <br/>
<br/>
  LPMuds used flatfiles for data storage.  Each user had a file <br/>
  with their information in it.  I imagine most muds are like this,<br/>
  since database integration back then wasn&#39;t very common to the<br/>
  little people.  But I have very little experience in Diku or it&#39;s<br/>
  spun off variants (Merc/Envy).  It&#39;s pretty easy to get the C libs<br/>
  for oracle and get the mud to query the database instead of files.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant may use Oracle to accomodate all functionality of the game.  <br/>
  There&#39;s simply no way to tell.<br/>
<br/>
  As for them running Solaris on their game servers, one can only<br/>
  hope &lt;g&gt;<br/>
