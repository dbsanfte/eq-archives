&gt; Yes they are preprogrammed to do the same thing every time.  However, if I<br/>
&gt; was within 20% of the other people&#39;s damage output over the course of 50<br/>
&gt; fights, statistics would tell you that during some of those fights I would<br/>
&gt; actually do more damage than them.  That never occurred.  In no fight did I<br/>
&gt; outdamage them for more than a few mob swings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re talking about a cumulative random series, not a<br/>
comparison of random events.  The only time you would&#39;ve had<br/>
the mob on you is when you initially started the fight, if you<br/>
&quot;got lucky&quot; and did more damage than them.  The longer the<br/>
fight goes on, the smaller the percentage variation in damage.  <br/>
You can &quot;get lucky&quot; again 1 minute into a fight, but it&#39;ll<br/>
never show up because the other guys greater damage over the<br/>
previous minute swamps it out.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, the longer the fight, the closer your total<br/>
damage will be to your average * duration of the fight.  The<br/>
longer the fight goes on, the less likely it is for you to be<br/>
hit even if you&#39;re only doing slightly less damage.<br/>
