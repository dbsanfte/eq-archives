My bard has stalled recently (never heard that one before, eh?).  I&#39;m<br/>
looking for a NEW zone that a Level 23 bard can successfully solo - AND GAIN<br/>
EXP - without spending a lot of time on CR&#39;s.  I&#39;ve been hunting in Dagnor&#39;s<br/>
Cauldron on Veeshan but the goblins are far between and it&#39;s been slow<br/>
going.  One advantage (or disadvantage) is the zone is ALWAYS empty, only<br/>
peeps passing to Estate of Unrest ever appear.  I&#39;ve had troubles hooking up<br/>
with friends due to RL hours and stuff so grouping if kindof out.<br/>
<br/>
I have been travelling to BB and GF to help out the newbies and work on my<br/>
skills but the experience isn&#39;t there.  I&#39;ve been to SK and LoIO which was<br/>
fairly successful, I&#39;d recommend it to anyone of similar level.  But I&#39;m<br/>
looking for something NEW!  --  Any suggestions?  Locations?  Just drawing<br/>
on all you highbies overwhelming knowledge.. /bows.<br/>
--<br/>
Also -- as I recommended to my guildies.. make sure you change the<br/>
EQCLIENT.INI file to support DirectX8 and log into the Test Server to make<br/>
sure you&#39;re system requirements are up to snuff.  I had an older system that<br/>
was running XP on a 3Dfx board (no current drivers available due to<br/>
out-of-business) and it choked when I tried this.  Directions for making the<br/>
change are in the patch message (you DID read them, right?).  The update to<br/>
DirectX8 will happen whether you upgrade to SoL or not, better to test now<br/>
and get the bugs worked out then the day they make the switch over.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2cp..<br/>
