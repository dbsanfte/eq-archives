<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-106912020">i was at a guild event where a fbss went only to melee classes, bards not<br/>
allowed.  i was steamed a bit, since a haste sash and another yak is all i<br/>
need before planes.  (but since it was generously donated for the event i<br/>
got over it quick)<br/>
<br/>
a week before this, an enchanter mentioned in a vox raid what would a bard<br/>
need with a runed bolster belt that was being lotto&#39;d.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m starting to get the impression that tossing good gear at bards is a<br/>
perceived waste to my guild.<br/>

&gt; And Bards are kind of left out of the loop even more being the most hybrid<br/>
&gt; of the hybrids....I&#39;ve been in lord room lottos where bards were not even<br/>
&gt; allowed in the Ykesha lotto because &quot;they don&#39;t need them as much as<br/>
&gt; rangers.&#39;  Puuuhhhleeeeeeze. </span></blockquote></div>
