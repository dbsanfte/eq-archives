 </span></blockquote>Salesmanship helps *smile*. NewbieBard is now level 11 and, having all songs<br/>
below 20 in the bank (though I will have to back for training brass and dual<br/>
wield) I have landed in Kunark. After binding at the bank (no point in<br/>
binding at the bridge, I will always need a drum for the return trip) I<br/>
headed off to Kurn&#39;s Tower in the Field of Bone. What a perfect place for<br/>
being a bard of 11 songs. The downside is you will not be able to hang on to<br/>
your silver or copper, the upside of that is you can offer it to any<br/>
groupmates in trade for bone chips, which you can sell later and more than<br/>
make up for your lost coin. Here was my pitch when I entered the tower:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bard 11 looking for a group that will make sure I stay alive. If you think<br/>
you hit a lot now, wait till you are hasted. A warning for those with<br/>
allergies, I am a mammal, but I have had my shots.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The first part is important, the run from FV is fun if it is very<br/>
infrequent, the second part is offer of something that you mostly can&#39;t get<br/>
in Field of bone/Kurn&#39;s tower, so I should be in pretty good demand. The<br/>
last part is to let them know that I am not a D3Wd. It got me a group<br/>
immediately, and I expect getting groups won&#39;t be a problem (if so I can<br/>
always hunt solo inside or at the bottom of the ramp).<br/>
<br/>
At any rate selling your abilities without being too heavy handed  (I really<br/>
find calls of &quot;Bard looking for group I HAVE MANASONG&quot; to be just a bit<br/>
tatty) often gets pretty good results. Knowing what you can provide and<br/>
where the best place is to offer it is half the battle, the other half is<br/>
communicating your message, if you get it right, you will rarely have<br/>
trouble finding groups.<br/>
