<b>Subject:</b> Mistmoor Drum Goes Poof <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-855433246">The last month has been a blast singing Chant of Flame and Fufils <br/>
with my Mistmoor Drum... I was dropping Blues fast, mixing in a<br/>
fear chain every so often... Then, yesterday I was switching from my <br/>
lute, had the pointer over it and the Drum went &quot;Poof&quot; !!!<br/>
  I backed up and searched the ground in a panic. Nothing there !!! I <br/>
petitioned and when the guide finally showed up her attitude<br/>
initially was &quot;Tough Toenails&quot;.. I finally talked her into reporting <br/>
it to Verant as a possible Bug and if they review my log I MAY or may <br/>
not get a replacement. Moonflower is Disconsolate.. I love that drum.<br/>
 Now the question is... at level 42, what are the chances of getting<br/>
a Drum of Selos March as a replacement ?  ..rare drop off Nagafen ? <br/>
Any tips ? <br/>
      I appreciate any advice you guys can give me,<br/>
