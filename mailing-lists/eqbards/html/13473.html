<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984979578">Actually, I made a post to the contrary, but I was fighting HGs and using fear, so they were frequently<br/>
beating on me.  It may be that the fact that I was getting bashed out of songs so often made me proc more<br/>
than would be normal with this bug.<br/>
<br/>
I am also inerested if anyone else has seen the fear problems I described in another post.<br/>

&gt; If you were referring to the previous post by Naeeldar about procs still<br/>
&gt; working as expected then it doesn&#39;t apply.  He was referrring to procs with<br/>
&gt; his necro and not his bard.  I think every bard who has posted has noticed a<br/>
&gt; decrease in procs after the patch.<br/>
