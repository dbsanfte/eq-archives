We have found the hunting to be very good Experience wise in Lake Rathe, <br/>
hunting the aviak guards that spawn on a tower on the first island out from <br/>
the dock. The spawn is quite rapid and we can usually alternate with a <br/>
second group for the 3 on the tower and both groups have as much action as <br/>
they can handle. There are also some aviaks on the Arena island. This is a <br/>
fairly isolated spot so there may not be much competition depending on your <br/>
server, on Xegony it is quite popular. You will need a group but we have <br/>
fought them from mid teens to low 20&#39;s so far with everyone getting exp. The <br/>
entrance to Lake Rathe zone is in the corner of south karanas past Paw and <br/>
the aviak town. Also, the aviaks in Lake Rathe do not appear to give a <br/>
faction adjustment. There are many other islands in Lake Rathe to explore <br/>
also.<br/>
