<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656093199">This weekend I got magic gloves for the first time (elf-hide gloves,<br/>
ewww), and I was able to kabong ghouls.  This made me think it was the<br/>
gloves which determined if you could kabong magic creatures or not (I<br/>
don&#39;t have a magic instrument, just the 4 I bought from the guild)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t dual wield when holding an instrument.  The<br/>
&gt; instrument prevents your second hand from attacking, just like<br/>
&gt; a shield (statements by Verant about needing magical<br/>
&gt; instruments to hit magical mobs notwithstanding).<br/>
