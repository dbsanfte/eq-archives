<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779339386">You got the Kite part right.  As for Lullaby, you use it when you are <br/>
already fighting 2 or more creatures.  It is an Area Effect song, so when <br/>
you sing it, creatures around you will go to sleep.  They won&#39;t wake up <br/>
unless they resist the song or someone is attack it.  So while you are <br/>
singing the Lullaby, you and/or your group should only attack one creature <br/>
at a time, so the rest of the creatures will stay asleep. That&#39;s why we need <br/>
to use the /assist command to make sure everyone in the group is hitting on <br/>
the same creature.<br/>
<br/>
As for Lament, you use it before the fighting starts.  Lets say you are at <br/>
an orc camp with 3 orcs in it.  You want to avoid the situation which you <br/>
have to use Lullaby.  So you sing your Lament song to 2 of the 3 orcs.  And <br/>
if they do not resist the song, you now can attack the third orc and the <br/>
other 2 will be too sadden by your song to join in the fight.  But you have <br/>
to make sure you pull the orc far away from the camp, because the Lament <br/>
song effect does not last long.  And also if the creature resist your lament <br/>
song, it will attack immediately.  So when you are singing your lament song <br/>
to a camp, you probably want to target one that is least likely to resist <br/>
your song first.<br/>

&gt;I am only level 10 at the moment but i had a question about the kiting<br/>
&gt;you guys were talking about. To kite a creature, you equip a drum, hit a<br/>
&gt;creature with a bellow, start selos, start running, bellow again, selo<br/>
&gt;again, below again...etc? Also, for only pulling a few creatures from a<br/>
&gt;bunch you said you were using the Lullaby. How does the lvl 8 Lament<br/>
&gt;song stack up to it? Is one more effective than the other? Thanks.<br/>
