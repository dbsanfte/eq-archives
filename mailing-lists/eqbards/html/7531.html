<div id="ygrps-yiv-63354773"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; is anyone happy with the classes they play?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m very happy with my cleric and my shaman.<br/>
<br/>
They both have bind, can melee and can gate.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention, create their own supplies (food<br/>
and water), my cleric can summon it&#39;s own<br/>
hammer weapon (why can&#39;t bards summon an<br/>
instrument?) and can buff themselves better<br/>
than my bard could even consider buffing<br/>
himself. Oh sure, it takes mana. But one shot<br/>
of said mana and I&#39;m ready to go. With a<br/>
bard I&#39;ve got to practice my pac man skills<br/>
with my hotkeys to remain buffed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you do know all of these particular things<br/>
&gt; were in effect since the game came out.<br/>
&gt; did you expect them to change?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A. Where in the poor excuse for a game manual<br/>
does it cover what each class can and can&#39;t<br/>
do in detail? Where in that same manual is a<br/>
listing of the spells that become available to<br/>
each class so that you know about bind? For<br/>
that matter - where in the manual does it even<br/>
mention the word bind or what it is?<br/>
<br/>
B. Things in Norrath are *always* changing. That<br/>
is the main &quot;feature&quot; of this game. YES I expect<br/>
them to change, and change often. Very quick<br/>
case in point - rearrangable spellbooks. They<br/>
said it wouldn&#39;t happen. Too much work to get it<br/>
done they said. *poof* It&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
BTW: Yes, I&#39;m bashing my Bard on a bard list. No,<br/>
I don&#39;t hate my bard - actually I like him very <br/>
much which is why I&#39;m complaining. I would love<br/>
to see him become more of a viable character in<br/>
Norrath so that I could realistically keep<br/>
playing him. But when I compare him to the other<br/>
class characters I have, I find it more difficult<br/>
each day to pick him from my character selection<br/>
screen over the others.</div>
