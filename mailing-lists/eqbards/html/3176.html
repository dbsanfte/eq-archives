<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773549761">I think it&#39;s time for you to make a boat trip. A good place that I hunted from level 11-13 (Although in a group...) is North Karana. At level 13-14, you should be able to solo this area fairly well. Make sure you have a magical weapon, as Wisps are a common sight in the area. Avoid Hill Giants and Griff/awns/ons/ennes. If one of these locks on to you, you&#39;re better of running for a zone instead of the guards. I liked to hunt near the gypsy camp, as this is where I saw most of the wisps.<br/>

  Subject: [eqbards] Where to go?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I just reached level 12, and now the things I used to hunt in Steamfront all con green. Where should I go from here? I could stay here and kill mino&#39;s, but they&#39;re too hard to find (camped most of the time). Where should I go from here? What&#39;s good for level 12? Any help is greatly appreciated.<br/>
