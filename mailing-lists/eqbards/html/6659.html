<b>Subject:</b> PL problems OT (was Sonorous Clouding still blinks) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-691059287">There was a notice on EQVault from Smedley saying the recent PL was a<br/>
problem with Cerfnet routers again.  I know a little about networking but<br/>
not enough to know why all the router problems seem to occur with Cerfnet<br/>
while UUNet always seems to work fine.  I assume that these are two<br/>
companies that work similar to ISPs and that Verant has a support contract<br/>
with them.  What I&#39;m wondering is if the problems are based on the type of<br/>
router the company is using (i.e. Cisco vs some other company) or is it a<br/>
internal operational problem (i.e. the UUNet people know how to do their<br/>
jobs better than the Cerfnet people)?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;That&#39;s possible.  I didn&#39;t check the lag meter, but I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;coping with 10%-30% PL most of the time for the last three<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;weeks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s been BAD! Wave after wave of linkdeads, and it is happening to<br/>
&gt; friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; with cable modems as well as with my dial up connection. I have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering if it was regional (Austin) or further upstream. Sounds like<br/>
&gt; trhe<br/>
&gt; &gt; latter<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That 10%-30% is with a cable modem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Early yesterday afternoon after slogging through more of the<br/>
&gt; same PL for an hour, something hiccupped dumping about a third<br/>
&gt; of the players off the servers.  When I got back on there was<br/>
&gt; a message saying they were looking into the PL problem.  For<br/>
&gt; the next half hour, I had 0%-3% PL.  Then they took the<br/>
&gt; servers down (presumably to fix the PL), and when I got back<br/>
&gt; on it was at 10%-30% again.  I fired off a feedback<br/>
&gt; complaining about it.  My friends in Toronto, Minnesota, and<br/>
&gt; California are reporting the same thing so I think the problem<br/>
&gt; is at or near Verant.<br/>
