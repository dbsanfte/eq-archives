<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993955936">I have a P2 266, Vodoo 3, 56k dialup connection, even so most all zones in<br/>
Norrath I have been in are extremely are playable. EXCEPT UNREST. I have<br/>
tried turning off the sky and particle density to no avail. I have talked to<br/>
others with the same problem. Besides getting a GeForce or an Athelon 800<br/>
(neither in the cards right now) is there any secret setting that will make<br/>
it so that at least my cursor doesn&#39;t slow to a crawl? Or make it possible<br/>
to weave, say, *2* songs?<br/>

P.S. I tried saying &quot;Would someone please bring a Greater Dark Bone to zone?<br/>
Preferably with fewer than 20hp and make sure he has no friends. Paying<br/>
Faction increase with &quot;WorstDressedBardsOfNorrath&quot; but for some reason I got<br/>
no takers.</div>
