I&#39;ll draft it up and post it here for review.<br/>
Admit it though, the only reason you want our caps raised is so you can run<br/>
faster :)<br/>

there was a long letter compiled by i believe Elwyn on one of the onelist<br/>
bards lists, not sure if this one.  it started from Elwyn, then everyone on<br/>
the list gave input, and it was revised 2 or 3 times and sent in.  we got a<br/>
response about a month later.  i used the word petition, but it was more<br/>
simply a letter.  i think if we were to have a follow-up letter, the skill<br/>
caps should be included.  if we were to add parry as a skill we desire, we<br/>
should also note we do not expect it to cap anywhere near what other melee<br/>
classes get, but more along the lines of our dodge skill (125 i believe).<br/>
also, perhaps GZ can finally put to rest the jig/mana recovery issue.  if he<br/>
says it&#39;s bogus, that is something we can really use for the naysayers.<br/>
