<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129985074"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m not sure those were pulls.  There&#39;s a buggy wall somewhere<br/>
&gt; on the dead side, where live side mobs can aggro on you.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen three live side trains, mostly stuff from the elder<br/>
&gt; room, run into the savant/executioner/cavalier area.  One<br/>
&gt; happened to a group I was in (I was leaving and saw it all run<br/>
&gt; past me, then I saw my group all die), and I assure you we<br/>
&gt; were not pulling from the live side.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  There are people who have pulled the live king back to dead side<br/>
  in the absolute train from hell.  I know it&#39;s possible, I&#39;d hate<br/>
  to be in the wake of that mess.  I wouldn&#39;t even want to conduct<br/>
  something of that magnitude.  We are talking like 20+ npcs. hehe.<br/>
