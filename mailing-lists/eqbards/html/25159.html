<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144943872">Well, here&#39;s the other perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I play EQ. My GF saw, wondered why I was on the game for hours, and now plays EQ as well.<br/>
<br/>
We have two computers, (Now), and I would be REALLY glad to get her off mine. I even already bought her<br/>
new accounts that I would PL her on. Now I don&#39;t have to PL her at all, she can just get transferred.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think $50 is no big deal to be able to get my account all to myself and not have to share<br/>
computer time on EQ...<br/>

&gt; You&#39;ll split the chars off to a new account and then sell it.<br/>

&gt; Long term - this isn&#39;t necessarily an e-bay issue - but short term it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; huge one.  Every person with a reasonably (to very) high level character<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t use any more will be tempted to split them off and sell them.<br/>

&gt; &quot;This should be rather interesting.  Power level a char up on a secondary<br/>
&gt; account, transfer to a friend that is too slow leveling or something...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cant transfer between accounts that are owned by different people (IE<br/>
&gt; different billing info including credit card.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Wonder how big an impact this will be to the community.  Hmm have a friend<br/>
&gt; who quit and doesnt have the heart to start over, no problem, transfer him<br/>
&gt; one of your old characters...<br/>
