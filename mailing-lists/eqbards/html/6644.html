<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I propose that we on this list work together on creating a guide that<br/>
&gt; educates all non-bards on the Do&#39;s and Dont&#39;s when grouping with a bard.<br/>
&gt; The guide would include a basic explanation of bard tactics and the<br/>
&gt; situations when they are used.  The guide would not need to have a complete<br/>
&gt; analysis of our songs, just the key ones.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once the guide is completed, we send it out to all the major EQ websites<br/>
&gt; labeling it as the Official Playing Guide for Non-bards published by the<br/>
&gt; EQBards Onelist community, the definitive authorities on all things bardic<br/>
&gt; (or something else along those lines:-).    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have seen one along the lines of what you describe.  I agree it would be useful<br/>
and I can see myself with a hotkey containing the URL to it.<br/>
<br/>
A separate question - where did the song guide from harpers get moved?  I seem to<br/>
recall it said it would be moved not deleted but I didn&#39;t jot down the destination.<br/>
