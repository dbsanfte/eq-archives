<div id="ygrps-yiv-602430141">Dont feel bad halana, I left a group yesterday morning cause of &quot;play mana<br/>
song&quot; all the time in combat (ya that will play in live cappy in karnors<br/>
without a chanter).  Umm ok that&#39;s real efficient, especially considering<br/>
that the shaman that is not primary healer since we had a cleric, was also<br/>
wanting the mana song... But wait there&#39;s more, this same shaman was also<br/>
trying to convince us that his haste wasnt as good as the bard one.  I said<br/>
babye people...  quickly found another group and had a nice/non-aggresive<br/>
chat with the cleric in my former group, she was quite nice and didnt like<br/>
it that i left...  What really got me was the paladin that brought up the<br/>
whole thing kept on going on and on that he also had a 57 chanter and a 43<br/>
bard. I told him to log them in if he thought he could do a better job then<br/>
me.  Whats even funnier was the small pickup group i got right afterwards<br/>
was amazed at what i was doing (charm fighting) and kept on wishing the<br/>
paladin in the live cappy would stop shouting for a bard/chanter every 5<br/>
seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I for one will start being very short fused when it comes to song requests<br/>
now and will not hesitate to leave groups without warning.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let it get to you too much halana...<br/>

Well, it finally happened to me.  I haven&#39;t played in a lot of pickup<br/>
groups, but have done a bit.  And until now, I&#39;ve not heard this phrase<br/>
uttered.  I thought I had escaped it.  But noooooooooo... the pickup group I<br/>
got last night was the WORST I&#39;ve had in EQ that I can remember.<br/>
<br/>
Players: Bardette, Monk, Ranger, Paladin, Shaman, Wizard (all between 43 and<br/>
45)<br/>
Scene: Solb<br/>
<br/>
The wizard &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing manasong?&quot;... me... &quot;uh, I am&quot;...<br/>
her...&quot;well just play it all the time&quot;.... me ... &quot;nope&quot;... her... &quot;well you<br/>
aren&#39;t a very good bard are you?&quot;... me... &quot;nope&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The paladin &quot;Tani, you need to play regen now&quot;... me ... &quot;well this song<br/>
does both so just sit tight&quot;... her...&quot;well i want to regen first then get<br/>
mana&quot; ... me.. &quot;that&#39;s nice&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Ok so I was a little sarcastic, but I wont even get into the pulling<br/>
techniques used by the ranger... Needless to say, I took the advice of<br/>
someone here and with a &quot;OMG I think my roommate just dropped something bad<br/>
.. heard a crash have to go check it out&quot;.. I logged... but wowowowow...<br/>
what an experience.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a nice weekend and a little laugh from my story :)<br/>
