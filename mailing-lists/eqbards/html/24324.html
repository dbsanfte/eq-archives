<div id="ygrps-yiv-986792328">I will be there.  Airline tickets purchased, Hotel Reservations made, <br/>
and Registration complete!  I needed to get back to the good ole US <br/>
of A so this was as good excuse as any ;)  I&#39;ll probably be a bit jet-<br/>
lagged and ready to party as everyone else is ready to go to bed <br/>
(flying in from Japan), but I am looking forward to it.  I sure hope <br/>
we can get a little time in to talk with them about our class too.<br/>
