&gt; &gt; bug with the  axis whatever is it something that Verant is aware of and is<br/>
&gt; &gt; working on fixing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If any of you have ever been to the Minotaur caves in Steamfront, is it me <br/>
- or are the walls there only solid to player eyes? I&#39;ll be walking through <br/>
one of the tunnels and all the sudden Meldrath or whatever his name is - is <br/>
casting a spell on me, but isn&#39;t anywhere around. Or I&#39;ll be fighting a <br/>
mino in one hall and a mino in another hall will make a beeline around the <br/>
corner and down the hallway to join in. (Or sometimes, quite often - <br/>
they&#39;ll just walk through the walls to start fighting you.)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the (second only to the boats) buggiest places I&#39;ve found so far.<br/>
