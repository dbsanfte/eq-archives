&gt; Well, it hasn&#39;t happened at L49 so I&#39;m not holding my breath that it<br/>
&gt; will happen at 50 as the song for that level appears to be an Anthem<br/>
&gt; upgrade. The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>
&gt; L48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; beat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; -----------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; just curious as I am much lower level than you and thus my experience may <br/>
&gt; not be quite as extensive, but are you working damage upon multiple mobs at <br/>
&gt; once into the equation?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sure, one on one, I have no doubts you are correct.  But I wonder about <br/>
&gt; group on group.........<br/>

thing of the past.  If you get 3-4 high blue mobs attacking<br/>
you at once, either the enchanter mesmerizes them, or you<br/>
Strike or Lullaby them.  If your group can&#39;t do this, you<br/>
might as well zone or evac because it&#39;s usually a lost cause.  <br/>
Once the mobs are mesmerized/lullabyed, it&#39;s a group-on-one<br/>
fight so you don&#39;t want to be playing area effect songs like<br/>
DDD and CoD since those will just wake the mobs up.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt the damage *I* do with my instruments will ever<br/>
significantly surpass the damage I do with weapons.  However,<br/>
my feeling is that using only instruments, I can often make my<br/>
*group* much more effective than if I were in there with my<br/>
weapons.  I&#39;ll have to reappraise this when I get Celerity<br/>
(which is singing), and Beserker&#39;s (horn - doesn&#39;t really<br/>
benefit from playing instruemnt songs unless you&#39;re willing to<br/>
swap instruments as you fight).  The Psalm songs are also<br/>
singing, so you can partially substitute these for the Rhythm<br/>
series while still using your weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I guess to summarize, the higher level songs seem geared more<br/>
towards singing, to allow your songs to be fully effective<br/>
without having to give up your weapons.  Overall though, the<br/>
balance seems to be pretty close, and I find myself switching<br/>
between instruments and weapons on a per-fight basis depending<br/>
on what we&#39;re fighting, and what the make-up of the group is.  <br/>
I think Verant intended this by design.  Being a jack of all<br/>
trades means you can fill in for just about any job.  If the<br/>
group needs more tanking, you can jump in there with your<br/>
weapons.  If the group needs more magical support, you can<br/>
stand back and play your instruments.<br/>
