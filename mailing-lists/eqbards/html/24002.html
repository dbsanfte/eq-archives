<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281840640">Heh..yeah, I just stood there and took it.  I managed to type &quot;stay back&quot;<br/>
but with about 3 or 4 random typo&#39;s thrown in before dying.  I don&#39;t stress<br/>
death...course, that time, no cleric was available (or willing *grrr*) to<br/>
give rezzes that night.  Everyone says how great selos is for CR, and it<br/>
is...but it&#39;s amazingly, ploddingly slow when you&#39;re running from Firona to<br/>
Dalnirs (through WW is the worst), and used to Selos with the MM<br/>
drums...hehe.<br/>

ah well<br/>
it happens sometimes.  you just have to be willing to bite it to save the<br/>
group, get<br/>
rezzed and try again.  same as when an sk or monk pulls, occasionally there<br/>
will<br/>
be too many casters (which messes up fd) or they fail a fd check.  then they<br/>
just<br/>
die and get rezzed and try again.<br/>

puller is learning<br/>
the aggro ranges and pathing in the area.  another part is being willing to<br/>
die when<br/>
things go wrong.  the number one priority is to not get the group killed by<br/>
a train.<br/>
