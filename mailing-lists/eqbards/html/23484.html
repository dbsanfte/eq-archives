<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310840494">Very boring stuff this time.  I guess good for Velious travel, but other<br/>
than that.  Well, expect to suddenly see another glowing spinning ball<br/>
signifying the minor polishing of the Plane of Mischief (read, oh hell we<br/>
forgot to put the port in)  &quot;that&#39;s been there all along.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*Small Patch*<br/>
<br/>
The EverQuest Team is currently hard at work evaluating, planning, and<br/>
documenting our project plans for the current year.  As such, we did not<br/>
plan game updates during this period, forecasted to last a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
However, given today&#39;s server maintenance being performed by our Operations<br/>
Team, we were able to include a few small updates.  These include some minor<br/>
polishing on the Plane of Mischief, as well as the placement of the wizard&#39;s<br/>
Velious teleport spells on merchants.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon, we&#39;ll be back to our continual plans to enhance the game world.<br/>
We&#39;ll be sure to let you know what we have planned as we can.<br/>
