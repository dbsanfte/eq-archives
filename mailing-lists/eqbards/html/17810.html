Since they&#39;re not, I&#39;m not going to countermand their wishes<br/>
and start piling equipment onto someone I favor.<br/>

&gt; Should we have ignored their pleas as well?  Not to trivialize such things,<br/>
&gt; but I don&#39;t see how high-minded issues of balance of power can be used in<br/>
&gt; this situation to make the idea of assisting her seem ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m saying it&#39;s really unnecessary to assist someone<br/>
for an event of this nature.<br/>

Let me try to draw up an analogy.  When you were in grade<br/>
school, you probably played kickball or soccer during recess.  <br/>
Now, if your parents were suitably rich, they could&#39;ve hired a<br/>
World-Cup-class player to play on your team during recess to<br/>
insure you&#39;d win.  But what&#39;s the point of that?  The goal of<br/>
this event is to have fun, not to win.  While it&#39;d be nice if<br/>
she can win, and if she can scrounge up nice equipment from<br/>
friends I have no problems with that, I don&#39;t see any need for<br/>
me to run over and dump a ton of L45 gear onto her.  Surprise<br/>
the people there by winning with strategy and guile.  If you<br/>
win twinked, most people will probably just be disgusted.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if this were her first dragon raid, I&#39;d be more than<br/>
happy to lend her a ton of resist gear.  But in a dragon raid,<br/>
the primary goal is to win, and having fun secondary.<br/>
