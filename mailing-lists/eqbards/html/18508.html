<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] What resolution do you all play at? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-21055092">i bought a second monster 3d II back in beta3 just so i could play in full<br/>
screen 1024x768, and have never played in any other res.  i just turn that<br/>
display option to not switch resolutions for my inventory screens.  was<br/>
lagging in this res before i got my new RoK system, but the geforce ddr-dvi<br/>
(as well as everything else being new) helped enormously.<br/>

&gt; wondering what<br/>
&gt; resolution everyone plays with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I personally stick with 640 x 480 because I can&#39;t stand <br/>
&gt; watching my monitor<br/>
&gt; switch resolutions when I switch to inventory or tracking mode.<br/>
