&gt;I know I&#39;m just one of the &quot;battle bards&quot; getting all wound up here, but I<br/>
&gt;really don&#39;t understand why people think we shouldn&#39;t have plate just <br/>
&gt;because<br/>
&gt;Alan A-Dale in Robin hood didn&#39;t :)   There&#39;s a specific set of advantages <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;disadvantages we have, and clearly plate is meant to be one of the <br/>
&gt;advantages.<br/>
&gt;Bards don&#39;t get double attack, kick or archery, but we get dual wield and<br/>
&gt;plate.  Rangers don&#39;t get plate, but they get double attack, archery and<br/>
&gt;kick.   And so on and so on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bards wearing plate is, I think, a good thing.  I&#39;m not sure if the mob AI <br/>
&gt;is working as intended, or not.  I know in P4, if I so much as hummed a <br/>
&gt;ditty under my breath in Greater Faydark, I would have, what seemed like, <br/>
&gt;every orc in the zone on my tail.  It seems this as been toned down some.  <br/>
&gt;Or maybe, since they are all green to me now, they steer clear of me when I <br/>
&gt;do make the occassional visit home.<br/>

long ago about druids wearing plate.  At higher levels, if a druid heals a <br/>
party member, this results in the druid pulling at least one mob off the <br/>
tank (sometimes all, this has happened to my druid).  Druids cannot wear <br/>
plate, their AC is a joke. They aren&#39;t tanks, but druids are supposed to be <br/>
able to melee some. Yet, their spells will draw the monsters onto them in <br/>
split second.  Clerics wear plate just for this reason.<br/>
<br/>
It very well may be this is why Verant decided to allow bards to wear plate. <br/>
Because they knew a bard&#39;s songs would instantly put him at the top of the <br/>
hate list.  If the monster AI, is in fact, working as Verant intended it to, <br/>
fillet of bard is a then considered a mob delicacy, and we should have the <br/>
plate.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the great thing about EQ, is that we are all free to decide how <br/>
we want to roleplay our characters, and there is no rule that says anyone <br/>
has to wear plate if they don&#39;t want to.<br/>
