<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054850171">Hello all, I have been reading the list for about 2 months now and I<br/>
am very impressed with the collection of knowledge here. My friends and I on<br/>
Tribunal server have just joined the 40+ club and are looking for<br/>
information on camping the SSOY (Ykesha). I am a 46th lvl Bard and my<br/>
friends are all 40+ including a 50th cleric. We are all looking around for<br/>
any information regarding this camp and if anyone might share some tips<br/>
and/or advice it would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
