<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879051495"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think the primary reason Verant started paying more attention to bards was<br/>
&gt; due to Rokenn&#39;s letter that he posted on the EQ board a few weeks back.  The<br/>
&gt; letter was in a proper tone (i.e. not a whine or rant) to illicit a response<br/>
&gt; from Verant.  The content of the letter was based off of months of research<br/>
&gt; and testing by bards on this list and the Concert Hall.  Every issue<br/>
&gt; discussed in the letter was a legitimate problem that every experienced bard<br/>
&gt; knew to be true.  This letter had such an impact that GZ decided to devote<br/>
&gt; an entire Arch Mage answers column to bards. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, you all stop tooting my horn (so to speak).  Admiral Rokenn and<br/>
  John(tm) are the single and foremost knowledgable and practical bard<br/>
  posters on the list as far as raw information goes.  And Kitasi for<br/>
  his testing of things over and over and over.<br/>
<br/>
  Anytime someone has a question about bards, I rattle off the EQ Song<br/>
  Analysis website.  Which I must add, Rokenn has done an excellent job <br/>
  at maintaining.<br/>
<br/>
  Some guy stopped me last week and asked if I was the Harmonic from<br/>
  eqbards, and the contributer to song analysis.  I told him yeah, and<br/>
  the guy wanted to get a screenshot of himself next to me...<br/>
<br/>
  jeez, I don&#39;t have _that_ big of an ego that needs stroking.<br/>
<br/>
  Pretty weird... I mean I&#39;d take a picture with a friend if we<br/>
  were at say Old Faithful in Yellowstone, but with a bard in the<br/>
  EQ game?  It was flattering, but I had to kill more deepwater <br/>
  goblins.  And plus I was starting to get scared, hehe... stalker!<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
