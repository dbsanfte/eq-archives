&gt;<br/>
&gt;Question for anyone here who can successfully stack 3 or 4 songs in crowded<br/>
&gt;zones:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I stack 3 whenever I fight unless lag prevents me, rare but happens<br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What are you using for hardware? (processor, ram, video ram, free<br/>
&gt;DASD/virtual mem - whichever is smaller, modem, typical connect speed,<br/>
&gt;anything else I may be forgetting)  I know I could use a bit of a hardware<br/>
&gt;upgrade, just wondering how little I can get away with. Also, what in-game<br/>
&gt;sacrifices have you made in the options to be able to weave/mix/twist so<br/>
&gt;successfully?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am using a p233mmx, 128 EDO Ram, I think 12 meg of SDRam on the video<br/>
card, Diamond Monster 3d2 Voodoo2 card, I dont let windows manage my virtual<br/>
memory if that is what you mean, and I am running a fairly clean install of<br/>
win95.  I have seen my friend running an almost identical system to me,<br/>
(Only 64 meg of SD ram) and he was running very poorly in some areas I have<br/>
no problems with.  I also turn off partical density which makes it worlds<br/>
better.  I also try to make certain I am running the most up to date drivers<br/>
for everything as well.  I can stack 3 songs in the bank in freeport even<br/>
when it is crowded if I want.<br/>
