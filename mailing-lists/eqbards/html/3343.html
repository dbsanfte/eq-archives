Verant folks on this list have specifically stated that this WAS intended<br/>
all along - that this is the nature of a bard.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem he had, was he hated the word &#39;twist&#39;. This prompted MANY<br/>
mails on other terminology - btw, transcordulation was by far my favorite,<br/>
still chuckling over that one - doubt it will ever catch on.<br/>
<br/>
I myself would weave tunes together much more than I do - but lag usually<br/>
doesn&#39;t permit it<br/>

&gt;This actually would not surprise me if it&#39;s something Verant added recently,<br/>
&gt;since Twisting can somewhat be considered an exploit, even tho Verant has<br/>
&gt;not announced this, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see that they added the extra<br/>
&gt;damage to make up for the added bonuses of twisting.  This way they are<br/>
&gt;happy, and us the unknowing are not getting as much benefit as we thought.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I personally don&#39;t twist, I may switch up songs in battle if the needs<br/>
&gt;arise, but I have never found twisting to be that big a benefit.  At 17th<br/>
&gt;level the healing song only restores 7hp/tick while standing, and the<br/>
&gt;average monster is hitting for 20-50 pts per hit, so the heal isn&#39;t worth<br/>
&gt;it, when if I play anthem and it doesn&#39;t ever quit they get a more increased<br/>
&gt;attack rate, so therefore they do more damage.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just don&#39;t think twisting is worth it.  The closest I come is while<br/>
&gt;bellowing, as soon as I see the damage message, I stop and restart the song.<br/>
&gt;This decreases the times between bellows almost in half.  I actually felt<br/>
&gt;guilty about this at first, but without doing this, I would have problems<br/>
&gt;fighting some of the black/white creatures that I tend to solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know that most bards do twist, and I do not hold this against you in any<br/>
&gt;ways, but are you wanting me to believe that the game was designed to do<br/>
&gt;this?  I don&#39;t believe it was, I think the reasons the songs don&#39;t stop<br/>
&gt;immediately is so that if you get bashed or stunned, that you can restart<br/>
&gt;the song without losing the effect of whichever song you were playing.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is just my 2cp.<br/>

&gt;&gt;      <br/>
&gt;&gt; Now my other observation has anyone noticed that if a mob hits you while <br/>
&gt;&gt; you are starting up a song he seems to be hit for max damage?  I noticed <br/>
&gt;&gt; the difference awhile ago when I picked up bellow.  I used to play one <br/>
&gt;&gt; song during combat.  Once I got bellow I noticed that hits that landed <br/>
&gt;&gt; just as I started a song resulted in greater damage.  This is something <br/>
&gt;&gt; that I have seen while playing my mage character over the last few days. <br/>
&gt;&gt; If I am hit while casting death beetles almost always hit for 26 or so. <br/>
&gt;&gt; Can anyone else confirm it?  When I saw it I just thought I was seeing <br/>
&gt;&gt; things.<br/>
&gt;&gt;      <br/>
&gt;&gt;      OUCH!  If this is true then Weaving songs may not be the best of <br/>
&gt;&gt;      ideas.  More chances for a full damage hit.  Anyone else notice this?<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;      I will watch closely from now on but my general impression is that he<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;      might be right...  Makes being a support bard make much more sense.<br/>
&gt;&gt;      If this is true (shudder) then this could change the whole<br/>
&gt;&gt; methodology <br/>
&gt;&gt;      behind running a bard character.<br/>
