<div id="ygrps-yiv-39448624">My experience in PoA is very limited.  But, since I haven&#39;t seen any <br/>
response on this, I thought I&#39;d give you what I know, Slyde.  When I <br/>
went, I was kind of confused as to what was going on.  I just <br/>
listened to the leaders and let Kaearia (aka John Kim) tell me what I <br/>
needed to do.  I do know that when fighting the Efreeti, you need to <br/>
buff fire/magic resists, IIRC.  After we fought him, we went on to <br/>
the island where the imp creatures fly around (forget their names).  <br/>
We had to all shrink to keep agro low and it was a non stop fight.  I <br/>
was basically told to just be a mana battery and swing my weapons if <br/>
needed.  I think these are the guys that drop the class haste belts, <br/>
but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
I know that there will be a lot of down time and that you will mainly <br/>
be buffing mana and resists.  My suggestion is to just listen to the <br/>
raid leaders and ask questions of more experienced bards on the raid <br/>
that have been before.  Maybe someone else will have more info.  But, <br/>
that&#39;s all I got Slyde ;)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
