<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114779994">Well, there it is.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 options. Roll over and die or Fight it. As a bard, I&#39;ve had more<br/>
than my share of dying, so I say we fight it.<br/>
<br/>
So far several issues are unaddressed. <br/>
<br/>
They said it&#39;s &quot;working as intended&quot; but they haven&#39;t told us what intended<br/>
is. We need to press them to find out what the expected resist rates are so<br/>
we can do our own testing. All we know is that the song is supposed to be<br/>
more effective vs mobs below level 30. Let&#39;s hammer that datapoint until we<br/>
can prove to them that they are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing abashi said is that he did a test personally and found that<br/>
resist rates on mobs below 30 conform to GZ&#39;s statement on resist rates. I<br/>
think we need to increase the sample size and prove him wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I propose...<br/>
I&#39;d like everyone to spend 5 minutes in your local newbie area singing<br/>
Lullaby to snakes, bats, rats, decaying skeletons, or whatever level 1<br/>
critter you can find. Log the results and we&#39;ll start a thread to post them<br/>
on. If we all do this every night, we&#39;ll get a huge sample size that will<br/>
acurately show the resist rates. Make sure you post your bard&#39;s level as<br/>
well as the log file.<br/>
<br/>
If we keep the pressure on, perhaps they will realize their error.<br/>
