<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-672262982">The warping in Q Hills is definitely NOT (ooh sorry Harm, sir 20 lashes) a<br/>
function of bandwidth or ping.  The warping in Q Hills makes things that run<br/>
away reappear at the zone line to Qeynos every time.  Its different, and<br/>
much more ridiculous if that&#39;s possible, than the warping that makes mobs<br/>
appear to teleport across small distances.  It&#39;s kill more low level players<br/>
than I can imagine every time Holly gets trained to that zoneline.  What is<br/>
with that warping anyhow?  How does it get so confused, the pathing in Q<br/>
Hills must really suck.  Hmm maybe they just copied the pathing code from BB<br/>
over and they can&#39;t find the ramps.  8p<br/>

Just so you folks know, warping like this is a function of<br/>
ping*PL/bandwidth.  We have to deal with this stuff (minimize<br/>
it) all the time for the stuff my company does.  Minimizing it<br/>
requires a lot of bandwidth (which is why most FPP shooters<br/>
limit the number of players allowed in a game).  The only way<br/>
to eliminate warping is to not make the game real-time.<br/>
<br/>
However, IMHO, the implementation in EQ is poorly done.<br/>
