<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-746366683">I assumed the big dog was nagafen too, buy maybe it is the leader of the<br/>
kobolds - kind of like the way Egyptian art depicts their kings as<br/>
physically larger than the rest of the rabble.  <br/>
<br/>
Technically Nagafen is a wyrm, a dragon is closer to a reptilian creature<br/>
than it is to a mammal like dogs or kobolds.  I would expect to see the<br/>
Iksar of Kunark worshiping a dragon but not kobolds.  Maybe goblins, what<br/>
the heck are they related to or derived from within the lore of Norrath?<br/>
Fire Giants?  Well they do belong to the ancient race of Norrathian<br/>
creatures according to the lore of the land right?  Dragons first then<br/>
Giants? Much later Elves and so forth...or am I getting confused with the<br/>
Silmarillion?<br/>
<br/>
Of course I am being silly and thinking too hard about this.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think I can answer some of this, and am surprised you <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t spot it too<br/>
&gt; &gt; with all the time you spend there.  The white critters are <br/>
&gt; frogloks I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe.  The one with the glowing eyes is perhaps the <br/>
&gt; first undead froglok?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Their eyes are a glowing yellow as I recall.  Did they have <br/>
&gt; a war with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; kobolds perhaps?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Why would the kobolds paint frogloks on their walls?  As far as I <br/>
&gt;   can tell, I don&#39;t think the kobolds know anything about frogloks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I think goblins, firegiants, kobolds, and nagafen are portrayed.<br/>
&gt;   But who is who is hard to tell, besides the big dog Nagafen.  If<br/>
&gt;   in fact it is Nagafen, it may not be.<br/>
