<b>Subject:</b> Mellifluos Motion saves lives in OOT <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-253223798">This song is odd that&#39;s for sure, and it&#39;s uses are pretty limited, but when<br/>
you need it you need it badly.<br/>
<br/>
At level 25 I was in the Ocean Of Tears (OOT) on an island fighting<br/>
Gargoyles.  In case you don&#39;t know, Gargs occassionally drop eyes that sell<br/>
for 9pp+, and for me they are blue.  One challenge of the OOT is that you&#39;re<br/>
on an island in a big zone, no zone border to run to if things get nasty...<br/>
This seemed like a good opportunity for Melanie&#39;s Melliflous Motion to help<br/>
out, so I memmed it.<br/>
<br/>
I had grouped with a 17th Enchanter (at her request), and we were beating<br/>
the Gargoyles down pretty handily.  I went off and pulled one, and while we<br/>
were fighting it two others crossed our path and joined in.  Well this was<br/>
pretty bad because I had not memmed lullaby (silly me).  So we fought one<br/>
valiantly until the Enchanter&#39;s pet died and then it was evac time.  I typed<br/>
&quot;This is going to be disorienting&quot; and hit MMM.  SQUISH  I&#39;m now at the<br/>
bottom of the OOT somewhere offshore.  Darkness.  I pull up and swim<br/>
forward.. up, up, up and finally break the surface about 200 yards offshore.<br/>
&quot;Wow!&quot;, the enchanter says.  Well here come the gargoyles, making a beeline<br/>
for me over the tops of the waves.  I&#39;m down to about two bubbles of health<br/>
now, so fighting three gargs in the middle of the OOT doesn&#39;t sound like<br/>
what I want to be doing.  They&#39;re on me now so I hit MMM again.  SQUISH<br/>
Again at the bottom somewhere.  up, up, up and now I&#39;m a bit further<br/>
offshore, the island barely visible now.  The enchanter is telling me that<br/>
she has made it to shore and summoned another pet and is medding/healing.  I<br/>
caution her that the gargoyles are still up set with us and that I&#39;m making<br/>
it for another island.  Soon I crawl up on the beach of the Sisters of<br/>
Erollisi island and sit down and play Hymn.  The gargoyles seem to have<br/>
gotten lost in the OOT.  I heal up completely and venture slowly out into<br/>
the sea, fully expecting the gargoyles to rush me at some point.  One does,<br/>
but not the others.  I pull him back to the shore of the Sister Isle and<br/>
quickly dispatch him to his maker.  I repeat my swim and pull procedure for<br/>
the other two gargoyles as well, quickly slaying them singly.  Problem<br/>
solved, experienced gained, and another bard has saved the day.<br/>
