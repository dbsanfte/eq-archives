<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800436405">I am also a RL musician, and i don&#39;t think that anyone, no matter what<br/>
you try to say on here, sings one verse of one song, then one verse of<br/>
another song, then the second verse of the first song, then the second<br/>
verse of the second song, etc.  if you do then you are annoying the<br/>
hell out of everybody.  this is what i mean when i say that a bard<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it.  a bard is proud of his singing and wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
appear foolish even if it did boost his stats.  this is all IMHO by the<br/>
way.  everyone is free to their own opinion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The juggling is EXACTLY what I do as a RL solo<br/>
&gt; club musician.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; the song that continues when you stop singing.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the EFFECT that the<br/>
&gt; song has on you.  When I sing a sad song, the<br/>
&gt; listener doesn&#39;t stop feeling<br/>
&gt; sad immediately after I stop singing.  It&#39;s this<br/>
&gt; *effect* that carries over<br/>
&gt; into the next song.  If the next song is a<br/>
&gt; toe-tapper, the audience may<br/>
&gt; still feel a little sad for a while even as they<br/>
&gt; start tapping.<br/>
