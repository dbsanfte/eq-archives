<div id="ygrps-yiv-982770939">Not true in my experience. When grouped with people 4 levels above me, if we<br/>
killed something green to them but blue to me, they got no experience but I<br/>
did receive experience. Can&#39;t confirm whether I got it all, though. And<br/>
everyone contributed to the kill. And when grouped with people a couple<br/>
levels lower, stuff that was green to me gave me no xp, but my groupmates<br/>
did receive experience. I&#39;ve seen it from both sides.<br/>
<br/>
It must be related to the gap in levels. You must be within a third of the<br/>
highest person (66% or higher is the figure I&#39;ve seen posted here) to ever<br/>
receive any experience. When I grouped with Sylly she was 32 and I was 14, I<br/>
think. I never received xp. I was too far away from her in levels. If I were<br/>
21st level I bet I would have received xp.<br/>

&gt; I agree with Thormeal here - I have a level 33 ranger that has been<br/>
grouped<br/>
&gt; with a level 9 paladin for a few days (doing a quest) and I will say that<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; I kill something green to me, he will not get exp if we are grouped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The confusion comes because if HE kills something, and I assist in no way<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the fight (I assume bard songs would be considered assisting, but I did<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; with my ranger so can&#39;t say for sure) he will get the exp he normally<br/>
would,<br/>
&gt; even if we are grouped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That is, of course, innacurate (Verrant won&#39;t let something like this<br/>
&gt; &gt;happen).<br/>
&gt; &gt;A high level tank will taunt the MOB off a low level character for him to<br/>
&gt; &gt;kill it. A high level buffer will buff / heal the low level character.<br/>
&gt; &gt;But they have to stay ungrouped or the low level one will get no exp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thormael<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I have been told that this is a common method by high level characters<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;powerlevel lower level characters.  Like you said, if the mob gives the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;higher level character experience, the lower level character will gone<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;none.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;If the mob does not give the higher level character experiece, the lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;level one character will get it all.<br/>
