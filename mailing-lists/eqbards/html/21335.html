&gt; Heh. I pretty much agree with your cynicism.  Hence the subject line<br/>
&gt; &quot;Probably pointless&quot;. :)  However, perhaps if enough other players take<br/>
note<br/>
&gt; and inform themselves about the issues with bards, this thread won&#39;t die<br/>
&gt; until it gets properly addressed by someone at Verant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The original Bard Thread has been locked at 385 mostly well-written posts.<br/>
&gt; There seems to be a new one at<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012233.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012233.html</a>  Please<br/>
&gt; post an explanation of what you think hasn&#39;t been addressed over the past<br/>
&gt; year.  I suspect that most other players of this great game don&#39;t<br/>
understand<br/>
&gt; how much bard players have been ignored and how our class keeps getting<br/>
&gt; broken with new patches yet not fixed or tested or even acknowledged until<br/>
&gt; months later when Verant declares things to be &#39;working as intended&#39;.<br/>
Even<br/>
&gt; if Verant employees don&#39;t read the thread and understand the issues,<br/>
perhaps<br/>
&gt; your post will help another player to understand.  The more people who<br/>
&gt; understand what is happening (even if they don&#39;t work at Verant) hopefully<br/>
&gt; Verant will start to realize that it isn&#39;t just a typical class whine<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; bards but there is a much larger issue that affects all their players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again for your ideas and support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pardon my cynicism (but it&#39;s hard not) - but despite all the good points<br/>
&gt; &gt; raised - Abashi made one or two namby-pamby response.  I get the feeling<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted all our comments in one place to make it easier to ignore (please<br/>
&gt; &gt; forward all comments to /dev/null...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It seems to me the real issue here is that Verant really doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; our class because they think the fact that we don&#39;t use mana makes us<br/>
&gt; &gt; incredibly powerful.  Someone made a fantastic analysis (sorry forget<br/>
who)<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a post describing &quot;Opportunity Cost&quot; - and of course - Abashi<br/>
ignored<br/>
&gt; &gt; that post as well...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Great post!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is a bard thread that Abashi has started (and if you haven&#39;t heard<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; it yet, shame on you for not keeping up on your EQ studies ;p) on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gameplay forum.   Currently, it&#39;s into it&#39;s 10th page, over 350 posts<br/>
(and<br/>
&gt; &gt; growing), and has yet to leave the 1st page of the forum..  Please<br/>
support<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bardic community by posting there (not looking for bumps or flames,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; more discussion).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, check out the latest Daily Screenshot at EQVault featuring Yours<br/>
