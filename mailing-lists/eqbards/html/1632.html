<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604456821">You should have no problems completing any quest at all.  Last night I<br/>
discovered that you can complete any quest you want.  Any class any race any<br/>
quest.  That is what the level 11 song is useful for.  I succesfully got a quest<br/>
from a high elf who would not give it to me if until I played the carillion at<br/>
him and then talked to him.<br/>

&gt; &gt;On the same type of thread, yesterday I picked up 2 Illegible Cantrips from<br/>
&gt; &gt;some orcs we slew.  What exactly are they, I tried to sell them but to no<br/>
&gt; &gt;avail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The illegible cantrips are part of a quest involving an NPC wizard (I<br/>
&gt; think..) found on the lower floor of the building at the entrance to the<br/>
&gt; enchanter/wizard/magician area in Freeport. Forgive the lack of detail but<br/>
&gt; it was awhile ago that I attempted to complete the quest (without success<br/>
&gt; due to my class). The building is the one you must teleport into by using<br/>
&gt; the teleport pad just outside of it. It is the compound area with the 2<br/>
&gt; magic users casting outside the &quot;gate&quot; of it.<br/>
