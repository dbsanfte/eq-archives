<b>Subject:</b> Re: Proc&#39;ing; Dex vrs Wis (was Bard PvP) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-911362024">Tried this out on my bard just to make sure. Loaded her up with a PGT and an<br/>
obs shard and went to fight some stuff. First attempt was with zero dex<br/>
stuff on (was at 95 dex). PGT procd twice, shard went off once. Then I<br/>
loaded up all my dex gear I usually strp on and it took me to 150 dex. PGT<br/>
fired off 7 times, shard went off 3 time. Redid this test 5 more times with<br/>
similar results.<br/>
And after reading this post I logged in to try out the wis argument for<br/>
procs on my Pal. Wisdom of 80 had 3 procs per battle, wis of 101 had approx<br/>
3 procs per battle. Didnt see a change, and dex of 140 constant.<br/>
So from what I tested, it is the dex that regulates proc/no proc. With a dex<br/>
of 80 on my warrior, just went and got a mith 2 hander to not have to worry<br/>
about it =)<br/>

&gt;everyone believes it to be dex.  i have yet to hear that wisdom plays a<br/>
&gt;role.  i think the consensus on dex is that if you hit more often, you will<br/>
&gt;proc more often.  sounds like it makes sense, but the problem is you do NOT<br/>
&gt;have to hit to proc, you just have to swing.  i have taken notice of this<br/>
&gt;after asking a level 50 warrior friend of mine for advice on stats for my<br/>
&gt;paladin, and he mentioned that.  with my paladin, for a fact i have seen<br/>
&gt;myself miss the first 3 swings of a fight, i inflicted no melee damage, yet<br/>
&gt;my ghoulbane definitely did proc.  dunno if this is common knowledge to<br/>
&gt;everyone, it surprised me.<br/>
