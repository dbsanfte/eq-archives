<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, I got the best prices from the lady in the hut to the<br/>
left of the entrance if you are facing the entrance to Rivervale.  I can&#39;t<br/>
advice staying in Misty too long though.  I ended up having to leave because<br/>
the guards outside the wall we just too damn protective.<br/>

RE: Anything but &quot;twisting&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been raised on &quot;stacking&quot;, but when chatting with other EQers I<br/>
referring to grouping, soloing, travelling, etc scenarios as &quot;gigs&quot; that I<br/>
keep to a particular &quot;set list&quot; for.  And perform by &quot;sampling&quot; different<br/>
songs.  &quot;weaving&quot; fits the middle earth feel of EQ better than sampling<br/>
though, so I&#39;d agree to that one.<br/>
<br/>
RE: Twitch way do you weave?<br/>
I use the mouse.  I don&#39;t want to waste hotkey space on something that&#39;s<br/>
already on my screen.<br/>
