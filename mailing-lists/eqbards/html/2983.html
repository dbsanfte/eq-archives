<div id="ygrps-yiv-471006552">lol ,,<br/>
<br/>
wasn&#39;t me ,, but trust me there are all types on RZ , people tell me that at<br/>
higher lvl&#39;s there isn&#39;t any pk&#39;ing ,,, well ,, the problem with that is ,<br/>
most of the notorious PK&#39;s are in my lvl range ,, and keep lvl&#39;ing up with<br/>
me ,,,<br/>
<br/>
when the race war server comes out ,, I&#39;m afraid it will be just me and the<br/>
pk&#39;s left on RZ ,, I might have to switch to a blue name server or<br/>
something...<br/>

&gt; ...on Rallos Zek. He must&#39;ve been around 11th lvl or so (conned RED to me<br/>
&gt; at 8th) and he wasn&#39;t very effective at killing me. I ran, he followed,<br/>
&gt; whacking me on occasion until I bagged my one piece of Banded Mail and he<br/>
&gt; realized it wasn&#39;t worth killing me for a rusty sword (explanation for<br/>
&gt; those not on the PVP server: You can only loot one item from your victims<br/>
&gt; and you can NOT loot anything from a container so it&#39;s common to see<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; letting themselves get hit while they put all their good stuff away.<br/>
&gt; Ridiculous? Yep. Funny? Indeed!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I must say though - I was very disappointed that a Bard was trying to<br/>
&gt; slaughter someone green simply for a piece of equipment, he even had the<br/>
RP<br/>
&gt; flag on (for what that&#39;s worth) but I guess it takes all sorts eh? ;)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve just sub&#39;d to the list and wanted to introduce myself.  I&#39;m having a<br/>
&gt; blast playing a Bard and consider this a fine class for someone who wants<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bit of everything ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One Question I have is I&#39;ve seen a Battle Drum mentioned on this<br/>
&gt; list...I&#39;ve never heard anyone speak of this instrument..is it made?<br/>
&gt; dropped? what?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
