<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319795354">Last night my friend and I managed to get invited into the Lord group. When<br/>
we arrived the group was killing 2 boks, after they were dead 2 people left<br/>
and we replaced them. 10 minutes after joining the Lord spawned with a Yak<br/>
and we killed him. I won the roll with a 52  =P<br/>
<br/>
The next time round we had 2 boks spawn and being only level 40 I was a bit<br/>
dubious as to whether Kelins Lugubrious Lament would be resisted. Our<br/>
warrior was gonna pull them both but I said wait. Told the cleric to get<br/>
ready to heal me big time, I then attempted the Lament on the right bok. It<br/>
stuck, I turned round and chained the left bok and he came solo. The group<br/>
was impressed and I got comments like wow, great pull mad, excellent work<br/>
and bards are great. I was pleased to see comments like this as I often<br/>
feel that bards are only regarded as crack dealers. It&#39;s good to let other<br/>
people see the value of bards in a group over than mana song.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, pulling the 1 bok enable us to break the spawn and made life<br/>
easier, shortly after we finished the 2nd bok another Lord with the Yak<br/>
spawned (I didn&#39;t roll). All in all a good night, got a Yak and a Burlupp<br/>
sack and am less than a bubble to level 41.<br/>
