<b>Subject:</b> Bugs from last patch (OT ?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048478612">This is another bug I have run into which creeped in in the last patch.<br/>
Apparently if you complete the Squad Ring Quest currently, you are handed<br/>
the ring and also immediately moved to KoS status will all residents of<br/>
Rivervale.  How the heck do they miss this stuff?  Sounds like they either<br/>
changed the faction hit for getting the ring, say from 5% to 100% (oops<br/>
D&#39;Vinn coder, should been 10%) or they added a faction gain that puts the<br/>
faction &#39;over the top&#39; thus turning it into a negative number.  After<br/>
telling my bardic friend on E&#39;ci how cool the ring was he finally completed<br/>
the quest this morning.  He is currently unable to play that character after<br/>
immediately dying to Marshal Ghobber and reappearing at his bind point...<br/>
Right in front of the PoD in the middle of Rivervale square.  Needless to<br/>
say the overzealous litle Zorros immediately whacked him again... and<br/>
again... and again... before he figured out what must be happening and<br/>
pulled the plug.  I saw 4 corpses in the Marshal Ghobber room last nite but<br/>
thought little of it chalking it up to the usual <br/>
W...H &quot;Hail Marshal Ghobber&quot;...A &quot;you hit Marshal Ghobber but he dodges&quot;<br/>
syndrome of forgetting to hit ENTER first.<br/>
This appears to be a major screwup that has seriously affected quite a<br/>
number of characters due to careless coding yet again.  I&#39;m certain my<br/>
friend has lost at least one level if not more before he was disconnected.<br/>
Not to mention the incredible amount of work he put into getting his faction<br/>
high enough to get the ring in the first place.<br/>
Has anyone else experienced this?<br/>
Does anyone have any word on how they are planning on fixing this?<br/>

	Once more very glad I already have my Squad Ring!</div>
