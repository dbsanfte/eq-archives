<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203736221">I&#39;m sorry you took my reply to your Goonda example as a<br/>
personal attack.  To me this is a game of optimization.  How<br/>
do I optimize my time to level/get items faster?  How do I<br/>
optimize my songs/attacks to let me kill harder stuff?  The<br/>
time it takes me to run back to my corpse vs. getting bound<br/>
closer is just another factor for me to optimize.<br/>
<br/>
Given your avowed hatred for running through the zone naked to<br/>
get back to your corpse, I&#39;d assume it would&#39;ve been obvious<br/>
the best way to minimize your time doing that would be to<br/>
first get bound closer, even if it took an hour to find<br/>
someone to bind you.<br/>
<br/>
The silly thing is I completely agree with you that I see no<br/>
reason for having a difference between what zones binders and<br/>
non-binders can bind at.<br/>
