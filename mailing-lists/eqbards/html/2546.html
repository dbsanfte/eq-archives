<br/>
I think you read by now that its &quot;perpetual random offensive casting&quot; so it<br/>
tis not a computer jargon term.  <br/>
<br/>
What about the names of characters? <br/>
<br/>
Sorry but with the large number of players and wide diversity of interest<br/>
(rpg to powergamer) you are not gonna get the &quot;purity&quot; that you desire in<br/>
these subtle nuances.  Even in small rpg - I bet they spend a lot of time<br/>
arguing whether something said was rp enough or not.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I thought of was: what if they made the /roleplay switch shut off<br/>
all chat from non-rp chars? Are there options for turning off /say chat?  I<br/>
have heard you can turn off /ooc and /shout chat. So now you can talk to<br/>
your group and guild and the npc&#39;s.  Have fun!<br/>
