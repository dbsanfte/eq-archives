Crier - 20th song Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This next song goes out to everyone who&#39;s had a corpse fall through the<br/>
&gt; world.  It&#39;s called &quot;Last Kiss&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh where oh where can my body be<br/>
&gt; Shaman gnoll took it away from me<br/>
&gt; I died while zoning and you know that&#39;s not good<br/>
&gt; Now I have to loot my body before it leaves this world<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was hunting Blackburrow with an Inky named Scarth<br/>
&gt; a basement train started but the zone wasn&#39;t far<br/>
&gt; somehow I passed it, a dead end straight ahead<br/>
&gt; I zoned running backwards then I went link dead<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back near the zone Lyssa&#39;s told me go right<br/>
&gt; Scarth&#39;s necro spell confirmed my very worst fright<br/>
&gt; I screamed aloud as another train passed<br/>
&gt; &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&quot; was the thing I saw last<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh where oh where can my body be<br/>
&gt; zone border bug took it away from me<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t go to heaven &#39;cause I&#39;m an atheist bard<br/>
&gt; whoever thought that dying could ever be this hard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Evulia, bard of the 7th verse, Tunare </span></blockquote></div>
