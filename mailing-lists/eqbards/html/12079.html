<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087498554">I am more lazy than you ;) - what I do is play mana song and let it get<br/>
going for a couple pulses, then play heal song and when the heal icon comes<br/>
up, go back to mana song and let mana song play until heal icon drops. Then<br/>
heal for a pulse to get icon back and then back to mana song.  I think it is<br/>
close - maybe I pulse mana one more time at the expense of a pulse w/o a<br/>
heal tick.  But I prefer the visual cues from the icon dropping to the<br/>
bother of all of the clicking.<br/>
<br/>
Also something to remember - other classes see the bard icons as blinking<br/>
icons (man that would drive me nuts!) So they don&#39;t really notice if heal<br/>
song blinks off as it is always blinking for them.  <br/>

Sylly Songsynger<br/>
&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>
Bard of the 39th song<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I get pretty easily confused weaving chant and celerity since they have<br/>
the same icons - hehe I can never remember which one I just did. I suppose I<br/>
should set my hot keys to 1 & 3 rather than 1 & 2 - that way if I start with<br/>
1 I can have a visual cue as to which song need restarting (top icon drops -<br/>
click top key; bottom icon drops - click bottom key.)<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. Instill Doubt in wolf-form is really annoying ;) hehe - I was<br/>
practicing between fights and stopped cuz I was driving my group nuts &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
But it can make for some fun Role Play when other players walk up - you can<br/>
bark at them and such hehe.  I finally saw a skill check (53) as was<br/>
practicing in the guild house with a lev 44 friend who played the int wis<br/>
song.  He dumped 30 points into his and checked at 70 pretty quick.  We went<br/>
out to west freep and dueled - using just ID.  I was the first to get one to<br/>
stick (kick for 1 and he was feared away)  but then he feared me a few times<br/>
(I resisted him 1 time too) - I&#39;d say 3 sticks out of 30 or 40 casts.  I<br/>
musta had one stick while I was practicing in HighKeep during combat - all<br/>
of a sudden the gob takes off for the bank or the bakery and we hadda chain<br/>
him down.  <br/>

		what I usually do is let<br/>
		Clarity tick twice (9 sec), give a shot of Hymn (3 sec) and<br/>
go<br/>
		back to Clarity.  That&#39;s enough to keep the Hymn effect and<br/>
		icon on, while minimizing the chance of disrupting Clarity<br/>
		(due to missed notes).</div>
