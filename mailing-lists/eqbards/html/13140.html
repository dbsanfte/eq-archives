banned.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been fighting at the top and the bottom of the temple for about 2<br/>
months now.  If you engage a mob and run to the bottom, the mob will<br/>
eventually follow you all the way down and you can fight it without<br/>
exploiting.  The frustrating part is when a small group ( 1 or 2) will sit<br/>
in the temple halls, steal the pulls, and exploit the mob.  (In many cases<br/>
this is a level 50 and a level 25 or so, get the hint?)  I normally let<br/>
people play however they want to play, as long as it doesn&#39;t effect me, no<br/>
matter how cheesy and lame the tactics may be.  However, when I head back up<br/>
the temple to find what happened to the Archon I pulled and find someone<br/>
exploiting in this manner (Numerous other mobs as well), I am forced to<br/>
/petition.  It was funny to hear from the guide that these players claimed<br/>
to not know they are exploiting.  How can anyone kill anything without risk<br/>
to themselves like this and think it is a fair tactic?  And when you&#39;re<br/>
ruining the fun of another group who is playing fair, at that.<br/>
<br/>
To combat this, I&#39;ve started to use charm to pull when the temple holds more<br/>
groups than mine.  (Just to keep this thread on topic :)<br/>

&gt; The Archon Temple is very buggy pathwise.  There are two primary ways in<br/>
&gt; which groups exploit this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) A puller is SoWed and (with or without levitation) runs down the tiers<br/>
&gt; and away from the Archon&#39;s steps to pull.  He punches a lizard in the nose<br/>
&gt; and runs back to the group at the base of the steps.  Generally speaking<br/>
&gt; that lizard hasn&#39;t followed him back, it is somewhere away from the Archon<br/>
&gt; steps, aggrod and &quot;frozen&quot;.  Quite often groups will curse the bad pathing<br/>
&gt; and run to the lizard to defeat it (nothing wrong with that).  However, if<br/>
&gt; the puller stands *on the steps* themselves at the Archon Temple top, the<br/>
&gt; lizard will unfreeze and run to the puller at the steps.  To be perfectly<br/>
&gt; clear: You MUST stand upon the steps for the mobs to come to you.<br/>
&gt; Therefore, the puller&#39;s presence on the steps becomes something of an<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Mobs that are aggrod to a party cannot reach the actual flat top of the<br/>
&gt; temple.  If (when) trains of lizards occur, simply run up the sloped walls<br/>
&gt; of the Archon&#39;s Temple and you will be both out of melee range and out of<br/>
&gt; spell range.  The mobs will remain aggrod on you, but will mill around on<br/>
&gt; the Archon steps.  Casters can cast on the lizards from here in relative<br/>
&gt; safety (this is an confirmed exploit by Verant, you can get BANNED if<br/>
