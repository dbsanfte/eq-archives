<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446854459">I was in Oasis a couple nights ago with a lower to mid-30s group.  All I can<br/>
say is that pulling a single Gob from the lake is darn difficult (we were<br/>
trying just about everything we could think of).  The DW gobs are very tough<br/>
as well.  One we could handle fairly easily.  Two was getting difficult.<br/>
Three would be possible, but we&#39;d be severly damaged and/or low on mana,<br/>
etc.  Four is just plain out of the question.  As I stated though.. more<br/>
often than not, you&#39;ll end up pulling a small army.  The lil&#39; buggers have<br/>
some nasty, nasty spells.  We were able to kill 2 or 3 during the evening<br/>
(ran from a lot) and we never saw a helm.  I would speculate that the<br/>
chances of them dropping it are roughly similar to lambent stones and<br/>
griffenne charms.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone here killed deepwater goblins to get this helm?  <br/>
&gt; If so, could you give me an idea of<br/>
&gt; the following:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -  What zone is best for this?  Oasis or Lake Rathe?<br/>
&gt; -  What level were the goblins, or was the party you were with?<br/>
&gt; -  Was there a particular type of goblin that dropped the helm?<br/>
&gt; -  How frequent a drop was the helm?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks all!<br/>
