<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490013691"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Should I have been using Chant instead of Anthem? I tried to compare stats<br/>
&gt;one time and they looked real close.  Chant with the drum and Guardian with<br/>
&gt;the drum both are enhanced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Bards argue back and forth on this it seems.  Anthem gives a very minor<br/>
speedup (10-15% or so) and a good str boost.  Chant sung gives a decent str<br/>
& dex boost, played they&#39;re roughly doubled.  Dex affects weapon&#39;s proc&#39;ing,<br/>
to-hit rolls, and most likely warrior critical hits.  If you&#39;re in a party<br/>
with warriors, rogues, or people with proc&#39;ing weapons chant is usually a<br/>
better option, IMHO.  After 36th you&#39;ll get Celerity which won&#39;t stack with<br/>
anthem, but will stack with chant.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Looks like Anthem is not enhanced by an instrument - true or false? (Ok, I<br/>
&gt;just checked myself and the chart says &#39;singing&#39; so that means no help from<br/>
&gt;any instruments.)  I guess it&#39;s Anthem if you are in the melee - otherwise<br/>
&gt;is Chant any better if you are drumming for other songs as well?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Ages ago (Phase 2) Anthem was brass playable (that&#39;s why brass is the<br/>
11th lvl skill), and it was an amazing speedup (around 40%).  It was nerfed<br/>
by making it sung only.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is it a bad idea to use AE songs in High Keep?  For example - could I have<br/>
&gt;used Largo&#39;s to slow their attack speeds?  Or would I have met all kinds of<br/>
&gt;new monsters from Area Effects?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I&#39;ve always avoided using AoE&#39;s in HK, the thin ceilings really worry me,<br/>
and occasionally people pull guards down into the pickclaw area. YMMV<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If a red mob resists the bellow - is it worth it to try again or does one<br/>
&gt;resist mean that they will always resist?  Does how badly damaged the mob<br/>
&gt;matter?  Say you see a resist in the top half of his health - so wait til<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s under 50% hp before trying another?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Sometimes it seems like health has an effect, but I&#39;d be willing to bet<br/>
that&#39;s just the random number generator doing it&#39;s usual wackiness.  The<br/>
pickclaws in highkeep are marked alot higher level than they really need be,<br/>
as a result you&#39;ll be fighting alot of red&#39;s for a while.  Either try<br/>
getting a CHA buff, have a shaman use malise, or an enhanter tashan, or just<br/>
stick to group buffs/heals.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   You&#39;ve got a few more levels where solo&#39;ing or small groups is ok for ya,<br/>
but soon you&#39;ll start seeing that a full group is sooooo much better.  Start<br/>
making as many friends as possible all around your level, getting a group of<br/>
6 is at times more difficult than any of the fights you&#39;ll be in.</div>
