&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;So you think paladins, rangers and shadowknights should also be able to<br/>
&gt;bind?<br/>
&gt;&gt;(Just trying to understand your position.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While I see where you are going, these are all more of a melee class than<br/>
&gt;bards (as a side not, there is a shadowknight quest where they can get a<br/>
&gt;rechargable Bind Ring similar to the Squad Ring).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The whole point of why I brought this bind issue was because I thought the<br/>
&gt;bind proposal was an interesting one, and one that could stimulate player<br/>
&gt;economy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To recap:<br/>
&gt;1) Bind would costs a lot of mana.<br/>
&gt;2) Group bind wouldnt be available until later levels.<br/>
&gt;3) Bind would require a zone specific foraged food item.<br/>
&gt; -Item would have to be player made into another item (make it high<br/>
&gt;level)<br/>
&gt; similar to the rat pie for the paw of oppula.<br/>
&gt; -Dont make all the items one specific trade, ex:<br/>
&gt;   -E. Commonland - Foraged item: Sundergrass, made into: Sundergrass<br/>
&gt;Soup or<br/>
&gt;         something..<br/>
&gt;   -Oasis - Dune Berries - Brewed into: Dune Ale<br/>
&gt;4) Bind/Group Bind required one reagent per group member, if not all<br/>
&gt;reagents are<br/>
&gt;   present, bind fails (Group bind would need 6 for all six), or make it a<br/>
&gt;random<br/>
&gt;   bind, 4 reagent = random 4 people get bound, similar to succor spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5) Bind/Group Bind Costs the equivalent of Dying once at your current<br/>
 </span></blockquote>level.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This<br/>
&gt;   affects all personnel getting bound.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6) Bind/Group Bind can only be sung once every 1-X days (TBD) similar to<br/>

&gt;We are in the middle of the hybrid magic tree in my opinion:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Top:<br/>
&gt;Druid<br/>
&gt;Shaman<br/>
&gt;Bard<br/>
&gt;Ranger<br/>
&gt;Paladin<br/>
&gt;Shadow Knight<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thinking about this really makes me wonder, if were not as Hybrid enough of<br/>
&gt;a hybrid to get bind like the Druid and Shaman, why do our songs fall under<br/>
&gt;True Casting/Arcane arts rules? Selo for one under this thinking should<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;fine inside.  Its like saying, a solar powered radio (druid/Shaman in this<br/>
&gt;analogy) will stop working when taken into a dark dungeon (hence, no light,<br/>
&gt;no power = hence, no force of nature - no power).  But take a Bard, singing<br/>
&gt;(equivalent to a battery powered radio), take him inside, and the analogy<br/>
&gt;falls apart.  The bard is relying on his own power (batteries/singing), not<br/>
&gt;dictated by loss of influence from a god, yet we cant work.  We know that<br/>
