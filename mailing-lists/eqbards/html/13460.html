6)  Begging 77 now, never got more than a copper (well, I seem to recall<br/>
having received a silver piece once, but I may be deluded), although I<br/>
now get a copper more than half the time, it seems.  Anyone with a<br/>
higher skill who managed to get more?  In terms of cash received, are<br/>
there &quot;good&quot; begging targets and &quot;bad&quot; begging targets (other than pets<br/>
and ships)?<br/>
