<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782669542"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just one point to make here. I&#39;ve been following this list since June or<br/>
&gt; so, and most of what I&#39;ve read from Kim and Ryan has been useful<br/>
&gt; discussion, analysis, and tips on how to play the bard. In fact, they<br/>
&gt; are probably 2 of the more prolific posters to the list and I usually<br/>
&gt; find the threads they post in to be very interesting. However, the only<br/>
&gt; posts I can recall reading from the recent complainers about their<br/>
&gt; latest postings are, the complaints.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  No, thats partially my fault.  I started off on the wrong foot<br/>
  today, and got a little carried away.  I want to make this game<br/>
  the best it can be, and that&#39;s my bottom line.<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry bards =D  (and Ariell, you know why, sorry man ;)<br/>
