<div id="ygrps-yiv-966572574">What happened to me last night - a druid casts it on me - I told her not<br/>
to do that - and said she did it to annoy me (grrr).  I had Selo&#39;s running<br/>
at the time.  When I switched off Selo&#39;s I found that I ran at normal (i.e.<br/>
non-Sow non-Selo) speed until I zoned.  Evidently it works like Selo&#39;s used<br/>
to when someone had SOW on them before the patch...<br/>
<br/>
    I almost quit grouping with the Druid at that point - but she turned out<br/>
to be okay - and didn&#39;t do it again.  In retrospect - I think she DIDN&#39;T<br/>
know about it - but made a poor attempt at humor after she cast it.<br/>
<br/>
    It seems that the majority of people don&#39;t know about the change.  Both<br/>
SOW casters routinely casting it on everyone who can&#39;t ask; and everyone<br/>
else freaking when you play Selo&#39;s when they have it cast on them.<br/>
Similarly - a great number of people still ask me to play the Jig to speed<br/>
their mana regeneration...<br/>
