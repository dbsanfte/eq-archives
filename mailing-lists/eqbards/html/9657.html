&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well hmm...  Can we hear from some people that DID find the quest items?  Is there<br/>
&gt; anything special you did?  And how long did it take?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>1. Lambent Gauntlets<br/>
Shin Gauntlets from a Froglok Shin Knight (Lower Guk; 35)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; You can get these staying near zone on either live or dead side.  Solo if you are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>high enough, group of low 30&#39;s, or hang around and ask if you are lower level.  I<br/>
have seen many pair; no major time investment.<br/>
Black Silk Gloves from a Deathly Usher (Castle Mistmoore. ; Level 30&#39;ish)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  Mistmoore is a nightmare, but the silk gloves were fairly common.  Trouble is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unless the ushers are trained to the zone you have to go in and mobs see through<br/>
invis and trains happen.  Medium time investment.<br/>
Lambent Star Ruby<br/>
<br/>
2. Lambent Greaves<br/>
Icy Greaves from an Elite Goblin Guard (Permafrost; Level 25; Room is tough)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  This took hours and was tedious.  Lots of aggro green trash there.  You may get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lucky with random number generator; I didn&#39;t.  I did however win the lotto for the<br/>
chrystalline blade 8).  They are the same blue as the lambent BTW.<br/>
Shin Greaves from a Shin Ghoul Knight (Lower Guk; Level ?)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; You can get these staying near zone on dead side.  Solo if you are high enough,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>group of low 30&#39;s, or hang around and ask if you are lower level.  They were more<br/>
rare than the gauntlets I had to try a couple evenings.<br/>
Lambent Fire Opal<br/>
<br/>
3. Lambent Boots<br/>
Firewalker Boots from a Solusek Mage (Solusek A, level 25&#39;ish)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Lots of aggro and you need to go in a ways to get to the Mages.  Didn&#39;t take too<br/>
 </span></blockquote>long.<br/>
Middle portion of the Rune of the One Eye from Froon (West Karana; Level 30)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Easy and quick.  Chains and fear or charm.  Lots o&#39; fun.  Watch Chief Goonda in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nearby ogre camp though depending on your level.<br/>
Lambent Sapphire<br/>
<br/>
4. Lambent Helm<br/>
Opoline Helm from a Deepwater Goblin (Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron?; Level 30&#39;ish)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Haven&#39;t tried don&#39;t want the helm (icky on half-elves).<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mudwater Rune from a Lizard Fanatic (Cazic Thule; Level 30)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Common if you hang out there.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lambent Star Ruby.<br/>
<br/>
5. Lambent Breastplate<br/>
Basalt Carapace from a Basalt Gargoyle (Lower Guk; level 35?)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Again the random number generator was against me.  They had 2-3 right before I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>arrived and then it took hours (5 or so) for the next one.  Gargoyles are fun to<br/>
fight.  Think assassin group if you are level 35 or so.  Ask the zone for looting<br/>
privileges if you are not able to handle zone yet.  Need invis to undead here though<br/>
so it&#39;s a bit tricky.  It shows black if you wear it.<br/>
Gypsy Lute from Gypsy in Piano Room (Castle Mistmoore; Level 36?)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Hell on Norrath.  I made 4 separate trips and died to monster trains more times<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than I care to admit.  The day I finally did get one I zoned in, a group of people I<br/>
was friendly with were already at the castle, they saw the lute on the gypsy, pulled<br/>
it, and it was waiting for me when I arrived.  Then I died to a monster train.<br/>
Lambent Ruby<br/>
<br/>
6. Lambent Vambraces<br/>
Fiery Vambraces from a Solusek Champion (Solusek ; Level 25-30)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Lots of aggro and you need to go in a ways to get to the Champions.  Didn&#39;t take<br/>
 </span></blockquote>too long.<br/>
The top portion of the Rune of the One Eye from Choon (West Karana; Level 30)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Easy and quick.  Chains and fear or charm.  Lots o&#39; fun.  Watch Chief Goonda in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nearby ogre camp though depending on your level.<br/>
Lambent Sapphire<br/>
<br/>
7. Lambent Bracers<br/>
Dark Boned Bracelet from a Greater Dark Boned Skeleton (Unrest; Level ?)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; With a group this was no problem just took a little time.  It&#39;s fun to charm hags<br/>
 </span></blockquote>8).<br/>
Griffenne Charm from a Griffenne (Karana&#39;s; Level 25-30)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Just kill every griff* in sight.  Once you get tracking these types of hunts are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so much easier.  If you don&#39;t have tracking yet try to hook up with someone who<br/>
does.  Also easy to hang out waiting for one in the lovely outdoors.  Watch for<br/>
Grimfeathr these days ;P.<br/>
Lambent Fire Opal<br/>
<br/>
The bracer is not lore so you can have two.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the lambent stones - not terribly rare.  I looted a couple of my own, had a<br/>
couple given, and bought a couple.  They go for around 30 platinum on MM.<br/>
<br/>
I have all the pieces now (except the helm as I said) and it is a dramatic effect.<br/>
<br/>
Luck to you.<br/>
