&gt; kept running<br/>
&gt; around so that the cleric and I were totally unable to do <br/>
&gt; anything, that I<br/>
&gt; finally gave up on them and went over to Frontier to hunt <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nah, man.  They were studying your moves and taking notes!  They probably<br/>
assumed this must be some new bard tactic invented by Sartori, tested by the<br/>
dynamic duo of Rokenn & Kim, and kept secret for months by Shada&#39;s guild.<br/>
But don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll always refer to it as &quot;The Kitasi Manuver&quot;  Expect<br/>
when you see them next to see casters running around wondering why the trick<br/>
doesn&#39;t work for them.   ;^)  <br/>

I think I&#39;ll use my races inate ability to hide now...<br/>
