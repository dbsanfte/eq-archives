&gt; Just because I was interested, I did a little network watching: zoning<br/>
&gt; generally spews out an odd 300k of data each time for normal density zones,<br/>
&gt; high density ones (NRO in particular) are closer to 700k.  You might be<br/>
&gt; tempted to think wow, with a DSL I can zone in 10 secs!  But you also have<br/>
&gt; the overhead associated with loading the new zone data from disk, which is<br/>
&gt; time consuming in and of itself.  If you have a new computer, chances are<br/>
<br/>
I suspect most of the time to zone is spent uncompressing that<br/>
data being sent from the server.  This was also the case for<br/>
Diablo - copying the CD to hard disk only helped to a point,<br/>
but upgrading the CPU helped tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, on my cable modem and 450 Celeron (OC) with 128MB RAM,<br/>
it takes from 15-35 seconds to zone.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now, on to ping.  Its just not that great of an indication.  Speaking from<br/>
&gt; experience (I&#39;m a network programming and sysadmin), opening a socket is FAR<br/>
&gt; more reliable.  I&#39;ve got a really quick and dirty pong program which does<br/>
&gt; just this as well as dumping out oodles of other interesting network info.<br/>
<br/>
However, comparing ping times for the same route (assuming<br/>
relatively constant Internet traffic) using two different<br/>
modems *will* tell you the relative performance of those two<br/>
modems, since the times across all the other hops should stay<br/>
roughly the same.<br/>
