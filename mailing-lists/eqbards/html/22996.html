<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546654207">Kit - you forgot you can do a &quot;/who warrior all count&quot; and get just the<br/>
count - without worrying about the list cutoff.  You can do this during<br/>
primetime and get better statistics.<br/>

        Warriors                32+     too many to list<br/>
        Rogues          9.5<br/>
        Monks                   5.5<br/>
        Rangers         30<br/>
        Paladins                27<br/>
        Shadowknights   17.5<br/>
        Bards                   5<br/>
        Wizards         19.25<br/>
        Magicians               29.75<br/>
        Necromancers    32+     too many to list<br/>
        Enchanters              25+     One night there were too many to<br/>
list<br/>
        Clerics         31+     Two nights there were too many to list<br/>
        Druids          32+     too many to list<br/>
        Shamans         23.75<br/>
<br/>
        With over 600 people on the server this means that either half the<br/>
server was      Anonymous or Roleplaying (Highly unlikely) or those classes<br/>
which were too many     to list were actually much, much higher than 32 in<br/>
number.<br/>
