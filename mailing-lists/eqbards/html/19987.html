&gt; Or better yet, completely eliminating me from ever having a chance to<br/>
&gt; fight<br/>
&gt; vox or naggie :(<br/>

&gt; &gt; Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we&#39;ve instead <br/>
&gt; &gt; decided that <br/>
&gt; &gt; dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the <br/>
&gt; &gt; magical ability to <br/>
&gt; &gt; pick their own fights.  Players of level 53 or above will now <br/>
&gt; &gt; encounter <br/>
&gt; &gt; some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these <br/>
&gt; &gt; dragons.  This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their <br/>
&gt; &gt; chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced <br/>
&gt; &gt; out by much <br/>
&gt; &gt; higher level players.  In addition, it also has the added effect of <br/>
&gt; &gt; creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Antonica to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br/>
