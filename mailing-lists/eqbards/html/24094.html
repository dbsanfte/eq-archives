<div id="ygrps-yiv-970824584">okies, For the second time, Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord is a +cha buff, not<br/>
a faction song.<br/>
<br/>
About my earlier comment, perhaps I was a bit harsh. I tend to exagerate<br/>
when I argue. I apologize for offending anyone and I don&#39;t mean to come off<br/>
as saying my opinion is the only valid one. Perhaps I need to refine my<br/>
opinion to what I actually mean, which is... this song has no place being<br/>
sung during combat.<br/>
<br/>
Atonal, I&#39;ve read many of your posts and I believe that you are a damn good<br/>
bard. And I respect your decision to wait on getting the mask. (that&#39;s what<br/>
I did too) The ring is found in Solussek A, drops off the Goblin High Shaman<br/>
and should still be an exp camp for you. I&#39;ve never ever seen anyone else in<br/>
that room and I hunted in Sol A for over 10 levels. The exp is amazing, it&#39;s<br/>
completely empty and it&#39;s a lot of fun, I suggest going. Getting a cold<br/>
stone takes seconds, you usually only need to ask. I&#39;m very rarely in a zone<br/>
that has no mages and they are usually very happy to be able to help. If<br/>
you&#39;re grouped, usually at least one of the party is a caster. At your<br/>
level, those casters ought to have a spell to enhance your vision, so ask<br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
While you don&#39;t *NEED* to ask for it when you have a song that does the same<br/>
thing, wasting a third of your resources on it to salvage some pride or to<br/>
save some effort in asking is foolish in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a half elf also. I&#39;ve never had trouble seeing. Guess I&#39;m lucky. On top<br/>
of that, I have my masks, and have attained level 14 so I can use them.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Concord CAN be used, but that doesn&#39;t make it useful. Once again, in my<br/>
opinion, the uses for this song are too few and too far between to make it<br/>
worthwhile. I would argue (vehemently if forced) that Psalm of Warmth (level<br/>
25) or Psalm of Cooling (level 33) or Shauri&#39;s Sonorus Clouding (level 19)<br/>
are all more useful than Concord. Warmth gives Infravision which should be<br/>
more than sufficient for any night blind race and it also grants a damage<br/>
shield AND ac. Cooling does the same as warmth only it gives ultravision and<br/>
Sonorus Clouding grants invis and see invis. Giving me a song whose only<br/>
unique ability is to track invis mobs is silly.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I apologize for my comments which were off base and unnecessarily<br/>
harsh.<br/>

nothing and adds to our versatility. Every other casting class gets a spell <br/>
that does this as well and it enables you to see without being reliant on <br/>
others or equipment.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m disturbed that anyone try to discount anyone else&#39;s opinions in such a <br/>
sweeping manner. The purpose of this list is to share ideas and strategies <br/>
and I&#39;m generally offended that anyone would say that their opinion is the <br/>
only valid one. I&#39;m glad to hear your opinion, but I would encourage to <br/>
hear from everyone else as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord is extremely invaluable. I can do almost any <br/>
quest and get nice prices in Ogguk and Grobb (with the Mask of Deception). <br/>
If Verant ever pulled this song away from us, I&#39;d definitely quit playing a <br/>
bard. That&#39;s how much this song means to me.<br/>
