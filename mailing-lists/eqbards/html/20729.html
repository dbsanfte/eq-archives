<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993640785">I don&#39;t mean to criticize one person&#39;s view of Roleplay - but I think you<br/>
have limited your imagination...<br/>
<br/>
Guildsay and /who are all telepathic powers that all Sentient beings on<br/>
Norrath have innately.  When you swear a blood oath to someone (the<br/>
Guildmaster) you have the ability to communicate telepathically with him (or<br/>
her) and everyone else who has sword a blood Oath to that person.  This<br/>
blood oath is more powerful than Religion and Race.  Roleplaying this could<br/>
require a ritual before the /guildinvite is issued.<br/>
<br/>
Switching Characters can also be explained.  In Norrath one has a Soul that<br/>
transcends the physical body.  The Soul can only posses one being at a time.<br/>
An individual is aware of the other beings his (or her) Soul Posses and has<br/>
the power to choose which to posses at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Some hard-core roleplayers may reject these and call them rationalizations<br/>
and I respect their point-of-view.  But I don&#39;t see them as mutually<br/>
exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
A Computer Game is limited by the technology.  There are so many things that<br/>
are possible in a TRUE RP setting (i.e. paper-and-pencil RPG) that are<br/>
impossible in a Computer RPG.  These elements I would argue are necessary<br/>
for the game to work and be fun.<br/>
<br/>
However - things like &quot;1 more bub to level!)  I&#39;m getting 20 percent package<br/>
loss!  I&#39;ll be on at 10:00 PM Central Time?  How was your vacation&quot;?  I can<br/>
see RP&#39;ers not wanting to hear those...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have pondered what I see as an anti-RP pressure in EQ a lot. I think it is<br/>
because the game itself requires so much logistics discussion. Logistics can<br/>
be diffcult enough when you are exchanging raw data much less gussying it<br/>
up, and so  people tend to be dirrect, which tends to sound pretty OOC.<br/>
Guildsay also breaks the RP framework, because there is no premise at all of<br/>
sharing a physical (okay virtual Phisical) location. How do you RP for more<br/>
than a short span when one person is in the Field of bone as an Iksar and<br/>
another in LGuk as a High Elf? Then add that the High Elf wants the Iksar<br/>
player to quit playing a secondary and come help... Not that it isn&#39;t<br/>
possible to counter the effect, just that it is hard work.<br/>
