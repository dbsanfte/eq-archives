<div id="ygrps-yiv-616776361">if you are outside you should never get smacked when recharming, no matter how<br/>
many resists it takes.  remember you can move and sing at the same time.  should<br/>
just back off from the 2 things fighting with selos on.  when charm breaks, start running<br/>
in a circle with the charm/charm/selo&#39;s sequence until charm retakes.  if you get adds<br/>
then you have to run in a circle continuously but you should still never get hit.<br/>

&gt;outside running around.  I use Selo&#39;s if I&#39;m outside just to get an extra<br/>
&gt;recharm chance or two before getting smacked.<br/>
