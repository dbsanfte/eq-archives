<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134409263">Simple solution to this, given a day to think about it I could come up<br/>
with 5 better ways (and thus have a variety of ways for different<br/>
dungeons).<br/>
<br/>
Every named mob in the dungeon drops a lore, no drop widget (make it<br/>
approprtiate to the dungeon).  The boss has a lor, no drop container, in<br/>
which you put the widgets, hit combine, get the reward.  A really clever<br/>
programmer could even make diminishing returns for not including all the<br/>
widgets.  I essentially did this in many of the Gold Box Construction<br/>
Set adventures I wrote (remember those?).  Usually it was done a little<br/>
more cleverly than that, but you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
With some clever programming, the EQ engine could easily give the game<br/>
we want it to be, just takes some time.  Also I want to volunteer my<br/>
time to them to write the bard song creation for EQ2.  I think JKim<br/>
mentioned it, but I envision a sheet of music paper where you combine<br/>
notes, accents, rests, tempos, etc... The end result is the song you are<br/>
singing.  You learn more as you go up levels, plus the ability to<br/>
combine various techniques into a single song.  How great would that<br/>
be?  It would not be that hard to write, plus a song book (which lets<br/>
you name and save your songs could all be done and saved client side,<br/>
making it easy on the server).<br/>
<br/>
I dont say this to criticize EQ&#39;s bards.  They have done for bards what<br/>
Baldur&#39;s Gate did for thieves.  (made them unique and useful).  I just<br/>
think their base system could be so much more.  How much fun would it be<br/>
to make your &quot;Overture of Wizard Wariness&quot; by combining some elemental<br/>
resitance with a quick targeted stun effect? (I think accented notes<br/>
would give the stun effect personally)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; A true dungeon crawl in EQ would only work if at the end of the dungeon<br/>
&gt; there was some type of reward that provided enough incentive to not camp.<br/>
&gt; This could be a major EXP gain from killing the boss mob or a treasure chest<br/>
&gt; that contained several items in it.  The level of the mobs throughout the<br/>
&gt; dungeon would have to be close enough that the party got EXP for mobs both<br/>
&gt; at the beginning and at the end.  There would also have to be a mechanism to<br/>
&gt; prevent a party from camping the boss mob over and over again. Lot more<br/>
&gt; other factors but these are the key ones.  Most likely in the &quot;to hard to<br/>
&gt; do&quot; category for EQ.  Maybe not for EQ2.<br/>
