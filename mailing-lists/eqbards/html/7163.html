<div id="ygrps-yiv-175976552">I can confirm this is the case. I dabble in brewing also.  I have tried<br/>
foraging in numerous zones since the patch that changed foraging.  When I<br/>
have been successful, I still get the old foraging items (i.e. roots and<br/>
vegetables), not any of the new foraging items.  Our foraging skill is<br/>
capped high enough to get food/water for regular subsistence, but not high<br/>
enough to forage any of the unique items.    <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I personally forage to be a brewer since I think bards should help spread<br/>
&gt; the good word of the pleasures of fine beverages.  The forage skill we<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; is too low for that kind of foraging.  Our foraging is sufficient to not<br/>
&gt; starve, but that&#39;s about it.  I have run naked from Halas to Freeport<br/>
&gt; (don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; ask) and even though I was constantly foraging ended the run with 1 extra<br/>
&gt; set of berries and thirsty.  I&#39;d also think we should be able to get some<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the specials at least occassionally.  Most of our caps are really too low<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; be particularly useful, and just high enough to be mildly interesting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would agree with the assessment that forage is not too low.  And if it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; low at all, it&#39;s certainly not too low to be useful.  I think it&#39;s perfect<br/>
&gt; for what they intended.  They intended it to be not as good as a full<br/>
&gt; fledged forager would have.  I forage way more than enough food, and just<br/>
&gt; slightly less than enough water to keep me alive.  So I can forage enough<br/>
&gt; berrires and fruit and such to give to my brewing friends, and still have<br/>
&gt; plenty of food to eat.  I don&#39;t mind that I have to buy water every so<br/>
&gt; often, since characters without forage at all have to do it a lot more<br/>
&gt; often.  I think those who think it is useless are either too lazy to press<br/>
&gt; the button often enough, or have a case of sour grapes (or is that<br/>
&gt; berries?)<br/>
