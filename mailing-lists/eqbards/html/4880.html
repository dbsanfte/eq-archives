<div id="ygrps-yiv-36161403">Hail all!  I for one am very happy to be a bard.  Still, some stupid things <br/>
do occasionally cause me to grind my teeth.  Though I lack the experience of <br/>
the master bards out there, here are my two coppers&#39; worth, cobbled together <br/>
from a few earlier posts:<br/>
<br/>
1. Do not cap our skills so low, like forage (40), and sneak (70) - absurd. <br/>
Raise the caps.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.  Why in the world can I never get better at foraging, when I do <br/>
it all the time?  I understand that there is likely a balance concern with <br/>
forage, since it can keep you fed and provide brewing supplies - but level <br/>
caps deal with that adequately.  Likewise, rogues are weak enough that it <br/>
hardly seems fair that we should be able to do everything they do as well as <br/>
they do it... still, our caps are so low that by the time we get the skills <br/>
they will only be useful against green MOBs so far below us we could ignore <br/>
them anyways.  If our pick locks is capped so low that we can&#39;t pick any <br/>
locks, why have the skill?  There aren&#39;t exactly a plethora of locks around <br/>
Norrath right now...  Likewise, what is the point of having Safe Fall capped <br/>
so low?  We get these skills at far higher levels than our peers do, which <br/>
is fair, and they are never as good as our peers&#39;, which is fair, but they <br/>
should at least be useful to us when we get them...<br/>
<br/>
2. Fix our broken songs - there are some that do not appear to do anything <br/>
(Disenchanting Melody) and others that are silly (random short distance <br/>
teleport that tends to put you in a basement of a zone or at the bottom of <br/>
the ocean - I waited 21 levels to get that?)<br/>
<br/>
The only good use I have yet heard for this song is in traveling, and I have <br/>
to say this sounds like hogwash to me.  We already have an excellent <br/>
traveling song in Selo&#39;s Accelerando, so if the only good use for another <br/>
(MUCH higher level) song is to duplicate (with some risk and randomness) the <br/>
effects of Selo&#39;s, get rid of it.  Considering we only get 1 song per level, <br/>
instead of batches of 6 or 8 every few levels, I would hope that all of our <br/>
songs did something useful.  I personally don&#39;t care that Chant and Anthem <br/>
are similar - they have some minor differences, and they stack with <br/>
different songs, so that is fine by me.  Still, how many songs do we have <br/>
(out of 50) that either don&#39;t exist or do nothing as far as we can tell? I <br/>
will bet there are at least 5, or 10%... this is pretty amazing really.  <br/>
What would you hear if 10% of the wizard spells did nothing or were <br/>
unimplemented?<br/>
<br/>
3. Do something about the Z-axis bug - I don&#39;t care how well sound travels, <br/>
it does not travel through several feet of earth and stone into a basement, <br/>
thereby drawing out uber-mobs who are hell-bent on destroying the bard, and <br/>
generally do so before he knows what hit him (often then don&#39;t even need to <br/>
leave the basement to do it!).<br/>
<br/>
This one is a pet peeve of most bards.  Why do the Chords only travel a <br/>
little ways on X and Y but a great distance on Z?  If it were just sound <br/>
carrying, we should have a much greater range.  Yes, I know that is a <br/>
two-edged sword, insofar as it would end up having bards piss off NPCs more <br/>
often, but it would make kiting easier.  Just make it consistent, either <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
4.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree... I have no problem weaving three songs most of the time, <br/>
but when I hit a laggy area I sometimes have trouble holding two songs up.  <br/>
Considering this skill is crucial to bard success, and (as far as I can tell <br/>
by conning) is figured into our ability to fight, we should not have to have <br/>
amazing reflexes to do this.  No, it does not take amazing reflexes to weave <br/>
two songs... but it can be very hard to weave three, and is mostly <br/>
impossible for me to get the mythical &quot;3.5&quot; songs.<br/>
<br/>
5.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rogues <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t we?  This makes no sense... must be a bug.<br/>
<br/>
6.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand <br/>
point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a <br/>
coin.<br/>
<br/>
Considering we travel more than any other class, we should be able to bind <br/>
ourselves, or there should be NPCs that will bind for a few plat.  Either <br/>
way is fine by me, but occasionally I have been in situations where I could <br/>
not get a bind, and was frustrated for some time.  I was in Halas once and <br/>
found not a single caster in the zone (out of about 6 people), much less one <br/>
who could bind me.  In Erudin two nights ago I was the only person in the <br/>
city, as far as I could see... it was late at night PST, and the place was a <br/>
ghost town... considering the length of the trip I had just made, if I had <br/>
planned to explore Toxxulia or the Kerra Ridge I would have been SOL.  <br/>
Thankfully I was only there for our largely pointless 14th level song and <br/>
some Erud&#39;s tonic.<br/>
<br/>
7.   Bard weapon / instruments<br/>
<br/>
I heard a funny idea for this the other day... make a &quot;Paino&quot; for bards... <br/>
it&#39;s like a small piano, but hurts more.  = ) Percussion instrument, 1H <br/>
Blunt maybe something like 6 damage 30 delay.  Or how about a Hammered <br/>
Dulcimer?  We could wield the hammers in combat... ok, this one is not <br/>
important to me at all, but would be a nice touch.<br/>
<br/>
8.  More magic instruments<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in the game there should be magical wind and string instruments, <br/>
and I do not mean nonfuctional quest items. = )  Something that does for <br/>
Hymn of Restoration what the MM Battle Drum does for Selo&#39;s Accelerando... <br/>
make it rare, make it hard to get, but make it available!<br/>
<br/>
9.  Why not make a Perform Skill?<br/>
<br/>
This is the bard-only version of begging... if you perform well enough, NPCs <br/>
will give you money.  I have had great success with roleplaying this for <br/>
PCs, but it seems to me that a young bard should be able to sit on a street <br/>
corner and make a few silvers by strumming his lute... level caps can keep <br/>
this balanced, and perhaps this skill could work in conjunction with the <br/>
Carillion?  OK, this is just another random idea, not important to the <br/>
class, but it sounds good right now = )<br/>
<br/>
Well, just a few thoughts off the top of my head.  Anything to avoid work... <br/>
= )<br/>
<br/>
May your voices ever be sweet,<br/>
