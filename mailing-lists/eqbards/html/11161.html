&gt;Subject: [eqbards] On levitation....<br/>

&gt;Q: What changed with Levitate on the last patch?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A: Levitate was changed so that if you already have the Levitate <br/>
&gt;spell on your<br/>
&gt;character, no other levitate effect will take hold. This was done to <br/>
&gt;prevent a certain<br/>
&gt;abuses of the spell which involved chain casting levitate to reach areas <br/>
&gt;which were not<br/>
&gt;designed to be player accessible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To get your levitation spell renewed, you can click to dispel it (this is <br/>
&gt;one of the<br/>
&gt;few spells that everybody can click to remove). Once the spell has been <br/>
&gt;removed, you will<br/>
&gt;be able to have it renewed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bards were unintentionally hurt with these changes - their song will not <br/>
&gt;overwrite its<br/>
&gt;own levitate effect. This error will be fixed with the next patch. <br/>
