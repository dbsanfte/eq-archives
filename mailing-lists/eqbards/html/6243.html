<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056237560">as jhenders said before, if you get a pull of multiple mobs that would make<br/>
your AE damage songs effective, you are pretty much toast and will have to<br/>
get out of dodge anyway.  multiple pulls of high level mobs means everyone<br/>
better concentrate on getting the same mob, one at a time, especially if an<br/>
enchanter is messing the others.  i haven&#39;t used AE damage songs in a long<br/>
time, as in dungeons you don&#39;t want to pull more than you have, and like i<br/>
said you want to concentrate on one mob at a time.  therefore my primary<br/>
role is party buffing of MR, STR, AGI, and mana, with weapon damage on one<br/>
mob as opposed to AE song damage.  i am sure L48 and L2 song with lute will<br/>
deal a serious amount of AE damage, but its just not viable in high level<br/>
dungeon scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. to jhenders i finally got a ykesha last week to replace one of my wakis<br/>
=)  pretty close to dueling yaks cause the second hand doesn&#39;t proc as much<br/>
anyway and waki has same dmg/del ratio.<br/>

&gt; You don&#39;t make not of the fact that you&#39;re doing damage to <br/>
&gt; every mob at once<br/>
&gt; with the songs.  Dual Ykeshas is obviously very strong, but <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re only<br/>
&gt; damaging one mob at a time with them.<br/>
