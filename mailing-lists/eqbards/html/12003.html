<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505033655">You *can* autorun backward, or in any direction for that matter including<br/>
circles, etc.:<br/>
<br/>
Hit FORWARD (or BACKWARD), ENTER to open a chat window while holding your<br/>
FORWARD down, then release your FORWARD key you will stick moving forward.<br/>
Now hit ENTER again to close the chat text box without sending anything.  In<br/>
my early days of EQ I didn&#39;t know about the NUMLOCK method, so I grew<br/>
accustomed to this method and still use it.  One benefit is that you can hit<br/>
FORWARD and TURN RIGHT, ENTER, release your movement keys and the hit ENTER<br/>
again to close the chat window and you&#39;re running in a tight righthand<br/>
circle - or swimming in a circle.  Great for practicing swimming while AFK.<br/>
To send /tells to people while charming giants I simply go BACKWARD, ENTER,<br/>
RELEASE BACKWARD, /t hey I&#39;m charming these two., ENTER.  But as they<br/>
caution George of the Jungle: &quot;Watch out for that tree!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just to spam some info that not everyone that I group with seems to know:<br/>
/tell can be abbreviated to /t, and /groupsay to /g.  I have not found a<br/>
shorthand for /guildsay yet.  /who can be as short as &quot;/w&quot; or just &#39;/&#39; by<br/>
itself.  You can see how many people are on your server with &quot;/w all count&quot;.<br/>
You can search for other bards in the zone by doing a &quot;/w bard&quot;, or on the<br/>
whole server with &quot;/w all bard&quot;, with the same being true of the other<br/>
classes &quot;/w wizard&quot; for instance when you&#39;re trying to remember who stole<br/>
your kill.  You can find out who in the zone is a certain level by saying<br/>
&quot;/w 25&quot; to see who&#39;s 25th, or &quot;/w 20 40&quot; to see who is 20th through 40th.<br/>
You can even go so far as to say something like &quot;/w all bard 40 50&quot; to find<br/>
all of the bards between 40th and 50th on your server.<br/>

I killed about 8 HGs and several Cyclops and Giant Skeletons in Rathe Mts.<br/>
early one morning when I should have been in bed - say 1:00am to 4:00am on<br/>
Fennin Ro.  I did this by stringing them non-stop.  I charm one, set two at<br/>
it, run around and hymn as necessary keeping Selo&#39;s up at all costs (MM<br/>
Drums).  When one wins, let charm break on the winner, lead him off a couple<br/>
hundred yards and charm him again.  Now hit your &quot;/pet guard here&quot; button to<br/>
park your giant and go loot the loser.  Charm breaks again on the winner and<br/>
you&#39;re off looking for a fresh one with a angry HG on your tail.  The<br/>
previous winner is really pissed at you, so when you charm the new one and<br/>
set it against the first one, the previous match&#39;s winner is going to<br/>
continue to chase you for a while even with the new guy on his back.<br/>
Usually after two or three charms the weakened one will start duking it out<br/>
with the new one.  Well it&#39;s pretty obvious which one is going to win unless<br/>
your new one is incredibly weak/unlucky and perhaps the old one has a<br/>
weapon.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you&#39;re healthy and there is a supply of giants you can keep this<br/>
cycle up indefinitely.  I eventually ran out of new HGs, so I had my HG<br/>
start wacking on Cyclops, Giant Skellies, even the little lizards until new<br/>
HGs popped.  There was a 50th shaman watching me do this and sending me<br/>
/tells about how amazed he was.  He&#39;d never seen bard charm done.  He really<br/>
was laughing when I had my HG smashing the little lizzies, but I couldn&#39;t do<br/>
it myself without zoning out and back.<br/>
