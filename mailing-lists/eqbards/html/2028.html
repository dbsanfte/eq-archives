&lt;&lt; was sitting lost all Stam down to 1 bubble and ppl on the boat kept <br/>
disappearing &gt;&gt;<br/>

Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I took my first boat ride the other night and also noticed stamina dropping.  <br/>
Hmmm, also sounded like perhaps I was swimming?  Ok, so I got up and walked <br/>
around till that strange sound stopped.  Stamina started picking up.  Sat <br/>
down.  Stamina started dropping again.  Finally realized that it didn&#39;t <br/>
matter where I sat, sitting just plain drained my Stam.<br/>
<br/>
People disappearing, yes.  Very strange.  Could just be graphics glitch?  I <br/>
was in a party with a friend and we were in group speak so can&#39;t comment on <br/>
/say.  But it was a little disturbing to see your partner sitting there one <br/>
second and then vanishing right before your eyes.  But because of opinion on <br/>
this and other lists, I refrained from singing on the boat at all.  Far be it <br/>
for me, little lowly 6.5 songstress, to be the cause of a boat crash!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying the sage and experienced words of our higher level brothers and <br/>
sisters.  But where are the young ones such as myself?  The tales and <br/>
adventures I read here are things I won&#39;t be seeing for some time to come.  <br/>
Are there any others in the 5th to 10th season with advice and knowledge to <br/>
share as well?  Let&#39;s speak up and help each other with similar questions.  I <br/>
have questions as well which I will post later (time for work!).<br/>
