<div id="ygrps-yiv-299251157">the best place i found to practice brass is in the tunnel from nro to<br/>
ecommons, in the room with the shady swashbuckler.  i went as far back in<br/>
the corner as possible, and started playing denons discord.  it does not<br/>
have to hit any pc or npc to work.  i went to sleep and woke up with 150<br/>
brass.<br/>

Mino Horns are a Wind Instrument ( you can play the water-breathing song one<br/>
dry<br/>
land for practice).<br/>
<br/>
I do not know of any good way to practice the brass skill because the first<br/>
song<br/>
we get is the improved chords.  I went to Paw at level 19 to practice it.  I<br/>
figured it would be safe.  At one point we had about 8 shamans and a couple<br/>
guards and captains all pissed at myself a cleric and a warrior.  It was<br/>
very<br/>
difficult to kill any of them because the shamans kept healing each other.<br/>
Eventually we had chase them down one by one into a corner.  So, if you go<br/>
to<br/>
Paw or some other low level dungeon to practice your brass skill, be<br/>
warned&lt;g&gt;!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there is another way to do it.  If you can find a remote enough<br/>
location where no npc&#39;s will wander by, you can play the song if there is a<br/>
player character who is not in your party within range.  Pretty neat<br/>
animations<br/>
go along with playing the horn.<br/>
