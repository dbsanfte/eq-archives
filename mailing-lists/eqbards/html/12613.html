<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458205031">Being a programmer assigned to a Customer Service team where I work, I can<br/>
understand this in a sense. A fix is made to a piece of code and now it must<br/>
be tested. Since the dev team does not have oodles of free time on their<br/>
hands, they cannot properly level a necro to the neccessary testing points<br/>
or they can&#39;t run scenarios through a variety of different spawn point<br/>
situations. (Take the whole shaman alchemy thing for example) They test a<br/>
few variations to make sure that it works as they expect. The other, and<br/>
more important thing that I have learned in situations like this is this.<br/>
The customer can always find more inventive ways of breaking something than<br/>
the coder can.<br/>
	I think the other thing is that they are trying to make up for the Levitate<br/>
&#39;fix&#39; that went in. They didn&#39;t mention the fix to anyone and it never<br/>
really got tested all that much on the test server. Then *wham*! Hello<br/>
Production. This actually makes a lot of sense in the testing world. A<br/>
tester would be told what was changed and asked to test it, not just told<br/>
that there may or may not be a change somewhere and be expected to test the<br/>
entire system.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] EQ Testing Procedure<br/>

Well, here you have it straight from the EQ team themselves.  In an excerpt<br/>
from the test server:<br/>
<br/>
Solution:<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<br/>
suicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<br/>
adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we<br/>
do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key<br/>
spawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately<br/>
break Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will not be affected.  While<br/>
this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet,<br/>
it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that<br/>
charming an NPC does.<br/>
<br/>
We would appreciate diligent testing of this change, to insure that no<br/>
unforeseen problems have been caused by it.<br/>

<br/>
So now they are saying they would appreciate diligent testing of a change?<br/>
Wtf?  Who is the customer and who is the service provider here?  I guess<br/>
this tells us everything we need to know about Verant test procedure.  Throw<br/>
the code out on the test server and hope some player puts it to task.<br/>
