<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787442649">People just say bards crash the boat because people are so paranoid that<br/>
anything aside from standing still will crash it.  And with the Xegony<br/>
crashing as it has been lately, whos not gonna believe in that.  Hopefully<br/>
they&#39;ll get the problem fixed.  I think the GM&#39;s are overwhelmed with bigger<br/>
problems.  Provided I dont loose my character like I did in the last great<br/>
Xegony crash, i&#39;ll take a few bugs here and there.<br/>

Freeport.<br/>
&gt; &gt;                  My gut is that there is no relation between the  two -<br/>
&gt; &gt;and this is yet another myth (like all bard songs will require  mana!)<br/>

&gt; My bet is that you were on a boat that was rather full 15+ people on<br/>
&gt; it...they have been having a problem with this happening and are working<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; a fix..the bard  causing the crash is laughable...If this happens to you<br/>
&gt; first petition and have everyone on the boat do so as well..the more the<br/>
&gt; quicker the response...I&#39;ve had this happen a few times and each time a gm<br/>
&gt; came and teled us all to our destination.<br/>
