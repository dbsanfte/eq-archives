<div id="ygrps-yiv-289937872">One thing what do you think us 46+ players had to play with? Guess what you<br/>
low levels are having a ton more fun then us high levles why do you think so<br/>
many of us twink? They have to do something about high levels because they<br/>
are the most unhappy there are only two zones excluding planes that people<br/>
do sol b and guk. DO you have any clue how crowded it is? We were doing<br/>
bothg planes and both dragons at the same time on E&#39;ci and guess what there<br/>
is still 80+ people in guk and sol b. This is a major problem and they need<br/>
to fix the problem not add stuff for low levels who are just complaining<br/>
that they don&#39;t get anything new added. Perosnally I could care less if they<br/>
didn&#39;t add anything new for me but I do care that it&#39;s crowded as hell  for<br/>
high levels.<br/>

&gt;Someone posted a link on the new Concert Hall message board of the new bard<br/>
&gt;quests on the PoA.  There are six bard quests and each quest requires you<br/>

&gt;Abashi posted earlier that 200+ class specific items were included in the<br/>
&gt;new patch.  It appears that most, if not all, of these 200+ items are<br/>
&gt;related to the PoA quests. Each class gets six quests.  Thats 84 new items.<br/>
&gt;I only looked at the bard quests, but assuming all class quests require<br/>
&gt;three components, thats 252 quests components (84 x3).  Some of the quest<br/>
&gt;used the same components so this number is probably a lot lower.  Most of<br/>
&gt;the quest components were items I had never heard of so I don&#39;t know if<br/>

&gt;I have no problems with Verant adding more stuff for the 46+ players to do.<br/>
&gt;That gets them out of the zone where I&#39;m at.  What I do have a concern with<br/>
&gt;is the apparent lack of attention given to players less than 46th level.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;loot found in Paw, almost every new item/quest that has been recently (past<br/>
&gt;few months) added to the game is geared toward the 46+ player.  I am not<br/>
&gt;aware of any new items/quests added to the game geared toward medium level<br/>
&gt;characters.  Perhaps my observation is subjective, but it seems to me that<br/>
&gt;Verant is focusing on keeping the 46+ characters happy at the expense of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Caveat: Its quite possible that the new PoA quest component items are<br/>
&gt;usuable until they are traded in and obtainable in zones outside of PoA.<br/>
&gt;Its also possible that these items are ideally suited for use by medium to<br/>
&gt;high level characters.  If this turns out to be true I&#39;ll eat my words.<br/>
