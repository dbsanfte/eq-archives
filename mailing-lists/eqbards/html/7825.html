&gt; &gt;At least on our server, the GM&#39;s have told us that using that way in to<br/>
&gt; &gt;do a Vox raid would be considered an exploit. They do have a huge agro<br/>
&gt; &gt;range too. On our server, we&#39;ve managed Nagafen, but Vox kicked our<br/>
&gt; &gt;butts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What?!?!?!!!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry, but THIS I don&#39;t understand.  Now they want to say that using a<br/>
&gt; DIFFICULT TO ACCESS &quot;secret entrance&quot; is an EXPLOIT!?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, so, using invisibility to sneak past an aggro mob should be an<br/>
&gt; exploit, and so should using your sword if the mob doesn&#39;t have one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good ghod!  Is there no end?!  If I hear so much as a breath of something<br/>
&gt; this inane on my server, I will probably sign off.  For good.  That&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; too far, I&#39;m sorry.  If they didn&#39;t want the hole to be there, they<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t have built it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the height of the steps and the fact that they are verticle would<br/>
imply that the designer did not intend you to be able to get in that<br/>
way, only exit. It&#39;s also quite obviously a bug that allows you to climb<br/>
a verticle wall with levitate. Using a bug to do something that was not<br/>
intended by the designer is usually considered an exploit.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously invisibility was intended to give you a chance to sneak by an<br/>
agro mob so your comparison does not apply. Invis was also given a<br/>
random duration to make it not a guaranteed way to get past an agro mob.<br/>
