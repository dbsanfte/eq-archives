<div id="ygrps-yiv-534740631">I had the same thing happen with a tentacle whip.  I was singing one<br/>
of my songs when the whips life draining effect went off.  At that<br/>
moment, my spell slots un-grayed so it looked like I wasn&#39;t singing<br/>
anymore, but my song effect still was in place and continued.  Trying<br/>
to sing a new song resulted in it saying the song stopped, but the<br/>
original song going when the weapon effect went off was still in<br/>
place.  Zoning or logging is the only way to get your songs back on<br/>
track.  I did report this up using /bug.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I can confirm this one. Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side<br/>
&gt; Effects&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt;at<br/>
&gt; &gt;times.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Some of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>
&gt; &gt;Root - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that<br/>
&gt; generate<br/>
&gt; &gt;the &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>
&gt; &gt;             have no effect on you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I seem to remember that WHILE playing Accelerando it was possible<br/>
&gt; for me to <br/>
&gt; be rooted, BUT i could cancel the effect by stopping and restarting<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; song. I don&#39;t recall it ever making you immune to root. Correct if<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; wrong! =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another thing I found (to my dismay):  I was really excited when I<br/>
&gt; got my <br/>
&gt; Screaming Mace. I know a bard using blunt weapons may sound<br/>
&gt; strange, but if <br/>
&gt; you look at the stats the Screamer is like a magical mino axe -<br/>
&gt; same dmg, <br/>
&gt; same speed, hits magical, and BONUS random Strength from it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Scream/Yaulp <br/>
&gt; (I really liked this because you could stack it on top of EVERY<br/>
&gt; other Str <br/>
&gt; buff - I had like STR 175 or something with a shaman buffing me, my<br/>
&gt; strength <br/>
&gt; songs, some magic items, and the Scream).<br/>
&gt; Well - it all sounds good, but I found that the Screamer causes<br/>
&gt; your songs <br/>
&gt; to go out of wack. When the Scream is in effect you can&#39;t sing. You<br/>
&gt; start a <br/>
&gt; song and it immediately ends with no effect. So I had to get rid of<br/>
&gt; my mace <br/>
&gt; (sigh).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll post if I find that any other items cause this effect. Also<br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; appreciate if any other bards have experienced anything like this<br/>
&gt; with other <br/>
&gt; magical items - it would be nice to post. It was rather irritating<br/>
&gt; to find <br/>
&gt; this out after getting all the required components for the mace<br/>
&gt; (what a damn <br/>
&gt; annoying quest).<br/>
