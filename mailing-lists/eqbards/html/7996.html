<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332532353">I recently played with a party of six in West Karana, and we tried<br/>
to kill some bandits in the bandit camp. I&#39;m interested in input<br/>
for how I can allow my more of party to survive a battle, including<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us were 11th Level, except for the Warrior, and the party<br/>
was comprised of:<br/>
2x Rangers<br/>
2x Bards (myself and another)<br/>
a Druid<br/>
A Warrior<br/>
<br/>
We tried the camp a total of three times, some of us dying every time.<br/>
There were(I think) 5 bandits, all blue, except for one, which was yellow.<br/>
The first time I had the misfortune to be playing Hymn twisted with Anthem<br/>
from the beginning of the fight, and I ended up with three bandits on me due, I<br/>
think to Hymn. Needless to say, I died. It was a fun run of shame back to<br/>
my body...<br/>
<br/>
The second time we tried it, we were actually jumped -- a pair of<br/>
bandits running by started the fray, and the five from the camp<br/>
joined the fun. This time the other Bard was killed; he was playing<br/>
Hymn. When I noticed his health dropping rapidly, I told him to back<br/>
off, and he did, but the bandits didn&#39;t stop. Is there anything I could<br/>
have done to pull them off of him?<br/>
<br/>
The third time, again there were 7 bandits. A ranger shot at a bandit<br/>
in the camp and those 5 ran at us, and two more running by at the same<br/>
time joined the fray. This time, I decided to use Discord, rather then Hymn<br/>
to try to do extra damage. I liked seeing 7 messages &quot;a bandit winces&quot;! But<br/>
once again, I managed to get the attention of a pair of bandits, and died. I&#39;d<br/>
asked the other Bard to play Elemental Rhythms, as there was a yellow bandit<br/>
caster in the camp.  He died also, I&#39;m really not sure why.<br/>
<br/>
This time I grabbed my spare drum to make the run back a little faster.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have any suggestions of how I could have survived the first and<br/>
last fight, and kept the rest of the party alive also?<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that I&#39;m only level 11 -- so I&#39;m really not interested in <br/>
hearing about<br/>
songs that are higher levels(at least until I get there :).<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I had fun, but it was a loosing night for me and experience.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
