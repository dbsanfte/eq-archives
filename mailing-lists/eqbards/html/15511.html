&gt; &gt; If you have your mouse control enabled, then you can hold down the right<br/>
&gt; &gt; mouse button to move the view.<br/>

(the two just before you switch back to first-person view).  <br/>
If the corpse is some distance away, the view can get &quot;stuck&quot;<br/>
in a certain direction, which I think is a bug with the bind<br/>
sight song when the target is outside the range your client is<br/>
normally getting info for.<br/>
