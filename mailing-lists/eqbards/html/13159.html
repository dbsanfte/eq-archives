A hybrid/melee will not sit on his/her butt during a fight.<br/>
A caster/healer will sit on his/her butt during a fight.<br/>
<br/>
You deserve bind if you spend 90% of your time on your arse.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents worth, on the wrong list again<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a repost of something I posted to the GZ questions thread.<br/>
&gt; I think we should be re-classed as casters, much like Shamans and Clerics.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Comments?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to burn me at the stake for being a heretic, but some good logical<br/>
&gt; responses would be nice as well :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ----------------------------------<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to pitch in my two coppers on the Binding Issue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand that the Dev Team feels that the current bind status (Hybrids and<br/>
&gt; Melee classes don&#39;t get it) is unlikely to change and is well balanced.  For the<br/>
&gt; most part I agree.  However, I&#39;d like to argue that the Bard shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; classed as a Hybrid.  Sound crazy?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hybrids are Warrior/Pure Caster combos.  They get some melee skills in addition<br/>
&gt; to the spells from a specific casting class.  IE Rangers get Warrior skills and<br/>
&gt; Druid spells.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our spells are unique in that they may mimic some existing spells, but they do<br/>
&gt; not come from any particular casting class.  We are a casting class unto<br/>
&gt; ourselves with completely different spells and casting structure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To be a Hybrid you must be part Melee class (Warrior, or in our case Rogue) and<br/>
&gt; part caster.  We&#39;ve got the caster part down, but where is the Melee part?  We<br/>
&gt; get Plate, but so do Clerics.  Everyone gets Dodge.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you skip dodge, what Melee skills do the Hybrids get?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ranger - (7) Kick, Taunt, Dual Wield, Double Attack, Parry, Disarm, Riposte<br/>
&gt; Paladin- (6) Taunt, Bash, Parry, Double Attack, Riposte, Disarm<br/>
&gt; SK - (6) Taunt, Bash, Parry, Double Attack, Reposte, Disarm<br/>
&gt; Bard - (1) Dual Wield<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, the other Hybrids really are part fighter and part caster.  In what way does<br/>
&gt; ONE melee skill make us part fighter?  In addition, all other Hybrids get<br/>
&gt; Archery except Bards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I fail to see how we can be classed as Hybrids at all, and feel that the<br/>
&gt; addition of a personal Bind song to be in line with the current Bind thinking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we&#39;re to have the disadvantages of a Melee Hybrid, shouldn&#39;t we get the<br/>
&gt; skills to compensate? If not, shouldn&#39;t we get the pure caster perks?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So far, we have a stick with 2 short ends :)  Thanks for the time...<br/>
