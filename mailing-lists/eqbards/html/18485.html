<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859311424">that was fixed the first patch after Kunark, has worked fine since.  friend<br/>
said something in the spdat changed from 66 to 65 (speed % increase maybe?).<br/>
one thing i noticed is, with song of travel you do not make the goofy<br/>
animation when the song pulses, you continue running normally though at the<br/>
increased speed from the instrument.  i do not know if this is with other<br/>
drums (have not tried mm or hand drum) but with selo&#39;s i don&#39;t glide nor<br/>
have a seizure, i just run.<br/>
<br/>
i dropped my drum for the first time tuesday night, i thought it would look<br/>
like a bag too but it is a stick.  it is also a very common drop off<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; No, seriously.  If you try to sing the level 51 travel song <br/>
&gt; with a Drum of<br/>
&gt; the March the song will behave as if you don&#39;t have a drum <br/>
&gt; because you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; exceeding the speed cap.  So it plays as if you were just <br/>
&gt; singing it (still<br/>
&gt; fast but uh....)  Fastest drum to use for lvl 51 song is the <br/>
&gt; one from Kedge<br/>
&gt; ;)<br/>
