<br/>
I JUST reached 27 (Ive taken like 2 6 month breaks heh). Any good ideas<br/>
for songs I should be twisting at this level? <br/>
<br/>
Any tips about Charm?<br/>

&gt; We get a new song at every level. Certain levels get two songs. At 27 your<br/>
&gt; life as a bard will completely change. No more annoying KSers. And you will<br/>
&gt; come to learn what few bards realize we can do. Charm Kite. This is<br/>
&gt; basically the strategy of charming MOB A to attack MOB B, repeat until they<br/>
&gt; both get down in health, recharm the one with the most health to finish the<br/>
&gt; other and then get xp for the kill. Repeat over and over again till you get<br/>
&gt; tired of soloing and raking in a nasty amount of XP. You could also try<br/>
&gt; charming that annoying PKer and send him in to attack a mid level NPC (ie<br/>
&gt; guards are always fun). That should wittle him down a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IMHO bards basically fill in where needed. We are the cement that holds it<br/>
&gt; all together. Healing and restoring mana where needed. Buffing at times.<br/>
&gt; Cham taunting mobs off casters. Intermitent crowd control. Use your<br/>
&gt; imagination because bards will basically fill in any hole in a party.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Right now I&#39;m around in Qeynos Hills (on the Tallos Zek server) trying to<br/>
&gt;   stay away from the annoying PKers..(doesn&#39;t anyone ROLEPLAY??, I mean a<br/>
&gt;   paladin running around killing everyone he sees??)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   And I was wondering if anyone has any tips for helpful quests.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;   already found the copper one, that pretty much got me to second<br/>
&gt;   level...lotsa running though. : )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What are Bards best suited for as they gain levels?  My combat isn&#39;t too<br/>
&gt;   bad..maybe like a Rogue?  And the songs are just too cool...I love<br/>
&gt;   wandering around with a spell up all the time...whichever I choose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Do we also get songs at every level?<br/>
