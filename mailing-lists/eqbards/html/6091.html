<div id="ygrps-yiv-462859346">I&#39;ll reply to multiple people in one letter.  Why not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; So it seems that you don&#39;t get any chance to increase your skills (hand-to-<br/>
&gt; &gt; hand or any other offensive skills) when using the Lute.  As far as I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell, you don&#39;t increase in Dodge or Defense either...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your hand-to-hand skill will indeed go up while using an<br/>
&gt; instrument.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was the kernel of info I was looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It may be one of those skills that doesn&#39;t go up<br/>
&gt; except upon success.  I spent a half hour running around with<br/>
&gt; a level 1 monk wondering why he was rarely hitting for more<br/>
&gt; than 1 point of damage when I finally got the &quot;You have become<br/>
&gt; better and hand to hand (1)&quot; message, after which it went up<br/>
&gt; pretty quickly.  (Doh - remember to train at least one point<br/>
&gt; in each weapon skill.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I could believe this.  What I was suprised by was not so much that my HtH<br/>
skill wasn&#39;t increasing, but that none of the other combat skills were<br/>
either...  I suppose I could understand Dual Wield not going, since I had<br/>
my second hand occupied, but Offense?  I&#39;ll have to try it more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hmm...I wonder how much a barbarian warrior can punch for at high levels<br/>
&gt; with a maxed hand to hand. 10? 20?  I *think* I punched for 6 once, but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure...average seems to be 2 to 4, with lots of misses.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He hits pretty hard.  Toss in Chant of Battle with a Lute and he&#39;s got<br/>
140 STR...  I suspect he&#39;s doing more damage with kick though...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Anyone with more experience in the support-bard role have any tips for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; battle-bard?  I was pretty impressed at how effective I am at higher levels<br/>
&gt; &gt; with just songs...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, lullaby just gets better and better...I hadn&#39;t used it for a few levels,<br/>
&gt; because it was such a hassle finding a spot where I wouldn&#39;t sleep people<br/>
&gt; in other groups. (On Rallos Zek)  But lately, with Cazic having 10-15 people<br/>
&gt; on average, I&#39;ve pulled it out again, and have been rather amazed how well it<br/>
&gt; works. 5+ lizzies, almost no resists, very few of them waking up early...its<br/>
&gt; beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Invaluable song, once the party understands how it works.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was with a party and all the other tanks but myself had to leave.<br/>
Was just me and two Wizards.  Had a combination of a bad pull and someone else<br/>
dumping things on us, left us with 4-5 blues for 3 of us.  Fired up Lullabye<br/>
and we took em out one by one, except for the one wizard that decided to attack<br/>
a different critter than the one I had targeted...  She dumped her 100+ point<br/>
spell on it and it frenzied on her.  I turned to attack it so she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
die, she starts saying<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;HEAL SONG HEAL SONG!&quot;<br/>
  &quot;No, not now&quot;<br/>
  &quot;I&#39;m about to die!&quot;<br/>
  &quot;Not as fast as if I let these two Spirit Stalkers loose...&quot;<br/>
  &quot;I&#39;m OOM!&quot;<br/>
  &quot;Then walk away and sit down and med.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I kill the Dark Stalker on her and we are now down to one Spirit Stalker.<br/>
I&#39;ve got 35 HP (I checked), she&#39;s down to a bubble of health and both finger-<br/>
wigglers are out of mana.  Get hit again, down to 27 HP.  Pull in a Bullnose<br/>
Snake who happened to be walking by.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;OK, you two med up till you have enough mana to kill this thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I equip my Lute to make sure they don&#39;t break the lullabye very often.  Hit<br/>
again and down to 21 points...  Start punching the snake to death so he<br/>
doesn&#39;t get the chance to get in a lucky strike and poison me.  The other<br/>
wizard bandages me (smart!) up a few times to keep me alive.  I hold the<br/>
Stalker at bay for several minutes while the wizards med up.  We agree to<br/>
try to root and dump on it.  Works flawlessly.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a copper for everytime I&#39;ve been able to stave off certain death<br/>
with Lullabye, I could make a fortune selling money on eBay.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lull has proven useful lately too.  Nice trick: Invis up, sneak past what you plan<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to pull, lull the stuff thats within agro radius that you don&#39;t want to fight yet,<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; have your puller pull the mob.  This way, with almost no risk, you have 3 fewer<br/>
&gt; mobs incoming...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also invaluable tactic.<br/>
<br/>
Now if I could just manage to convince the Rangers that I group with that I&#39;m<br/>
better equipped to be puller than they are.  Just because you have tracking<br/>
doesn&#39;t make you a good puller.  I&#39;d rather have Accelerando, Lament and<br/>
Bellow for pulling, and Lullabye for when things go badly...</div>
