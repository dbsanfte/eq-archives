<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988001715">I tried.  He has clarity now and so can usually handle the mana no problem.<br/>
He ends up most fights with 6+ mobs at 40% mana while the clerics are<br/>
medding during the end of the fight.  He basically meds thru the fight and<br/>
pops up when things un-mez.<br/>
<br/>
My Anthem is no where near as good as his haste buffs anyhow.  The one time<br/>
we tried it, the other two tanks complained about being slow.<br/>

As an enchanter, I&#39;d MUCH prefer having a bard in the battle doing the<br/>
haste.<br/>
My QUicken spell takes a LOT of mana -- more than anything else I have.<br/>
And does not last very long. If I have a bard asting, it leaves my mana free<br/>
to Debuff/Slow and Mes when others join in. (I consider crowd control<br/>
my primary. If we get extras, I don&#39;t have time to cast the haste buff<br/>
anyway. I am dealing with extra critters) You might talk to your enchanter,<br/>
see if you can take that haste duty off of their hands. Their mana bars<br/>
may very well end up loving you :) EVen with Breeze, now, I can&#39;t always<br/>
keep up.<br/>
<br/>
They have quite a few other spells they can cast with extra mana --<br/>
Strength debuffs of various sorts, Color Flux, Whirl Until you Hurl,<br/>
Cancel Magic, Root (depending on what you are fighting/what comes)<br/>

&gt;Hmmm...  This could be it, still sounds like a bug to me since it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;consistent.  It isn&#39;t a big deal I guess, but just leaves me with no low<br/>
&gt;level buffs that i can use when we have a good enchanter (IE one who<br/>
&gt;would rather haste the bashers then try to be 4th rate wizard)<br/>
