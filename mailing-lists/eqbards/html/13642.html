<div id="ygrps-yiv-138399154">Heh that was 2 months ago roughly I guess when  he stated that the majority<br/>
had a 30-40 level char. By now it&#39;s easily up to 35-45 probably higher. So<br/>
no your wrong and again their aren&#39;t problems at mid level you just want<br/>
something to be added for it for the hell of it we don&#39;t we want it to be<br/>
less crowded and able to hunt in zones.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Brad has already stated publicly that the majority of their customers<br/>
&gt;&gt; have mid level characters. He stated this when Paw was upgraded so you<br/>
&gt;&gt; can take his &quot;mid level&quot; as someone suitable to play Paw. As Brad has<br/>
&gt;&gt; direct access to the customer database, I think this provides a perfect<br/>
&gt;&gt; example of the uselessness of web polls. The only thing that poll tells<br/>
&gt;&gt; you is that 6% of the people who go to everlore and bothered to take the<br/>
&gt;&gt; poll (and only voted once) have a 45+ character. I hope you can<br/>
&gt;&gt; understand the difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course I can, that&#39;s why I said &quot;if that poll is accurate.&quot;  I hope you<br/>
&gt;can understand. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even going by Brad&#39;s statement, if the majority of people have &quot;mid-level&quot;<br/>
&gt;characters, they should get the majority of the attention, so the rest of<br/>
