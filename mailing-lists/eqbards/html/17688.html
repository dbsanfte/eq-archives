<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047211638">Yeah get RAM.<br/>
I was playing on a:<br/>
P166MMX (Runnning 2.5x75 =&gt; 187,5MHz)<br/>
96Mb of RAM<br/>
3dfx voodoo 1 card<br/>
SB Live<br/>
ISDN line (Playing from Denmark so I  have a bit of latency)<br/>
<br/>
Particle density off.<br/>
I started off with 32Mb of RAM but I upgraded it within the first week of beta4<br/>
the game was totally unplayable, I remember taking falling damage from taking<br/>
the lifts in Kelethin.<br/>
After I added RAM I could keep up 3 songs by counting, since counting and<br/>
reading/writing is hard to do at the same time I normally only did 2 songs.<br/>
<br/>
Now Ive upgraded to a:<br/>
AMD Athlon 550MHz. (Running 605 at the moment.. Should be able to do 750 when I<br/>
get a GFD)<br/>
128Mb RAM<br/>
ASUS Geforce V6800<br/>
SBlive<br/>
ISDN<br/>
Particle density high (I suspect I will turn it down once I get enough of the<br/>
flashy lights)<br/>
Offcourse there is a world of difference (I only upgraded because of RoK) and I<br/>
can keep 3 songs up with little effort..<br/>
<br/>
Well If I had your system I would get more RAM atleast up to 128Mb<br/>
and then wait and see how good RoK will work..<br/>

&gt;RAM RAM RAM...I played on a Viper v550<br/>
&gt;for a LOOOONG time.  That isint a bad card at ALL...<br/>
&gt;the thing is that video card techjnology has jumped so far SO fast..<br/>
&gt;you can do a LOT worse than the v550.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, if you want to increase performance...RAM is teh WAY to go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;after upgrading to 128MB from....32MB (ack!) my whole world changed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I used to eave the room to get drinks while zoning...now I zone in under<br/>
&gt;20 seconds usually ( well mabey a bit higher in some zones...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;RAM is good.  Get RAM..:) </span></blockquote></div>
