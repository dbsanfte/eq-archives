<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959031476">bards are tough to categorize.  if it comes down to it and a gun is put to<br/>
my head, i&#39;ll say we are hybrids and i think verant says the same.  since we<br/>
bards are such a mixture of everything, let&#39;s take bards out of the<br/>
equation.  now as far as the definition of hybrid: The offspring of the<br/>
union of two distinct species (or classes in this case).  by definition you<br/>
can not classify shaman, cleric, or druid as hybrids.  this is not an<br/>
opinion.  SHD, RNG, PAL are hybrids.  the priests are not.  bard is the only<br/>
room for discussion.  can we put this hybrid thread to rest?  talk about<br/>
binding is fine, let&#39;s just not talk about who is or is not a hybrid.  it&#39;s<br/>
obvious.  it&#39;s not what your abilities are, it&#39;s where your class came from.<br/>
only those 3, and maybe bard, are a combination of two other classes.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that&#39;s your logic why are bards rogue/enchanters?  We <br/>
&gt; cannot enchant<br/>
&gt; anything.  We have pathetic unuseable rogue abilities.  We <br/>
&gt; are hardly a<br/>
&gt; combination of the two unless Andy Warhol is a deity in this <br/>
&gt; world too.<br/>
