<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299028915">Hello, my fine brethern in song!  I am Linako LindenLyre (also known as Linako the Unlucky, Linako the Mob Magnet, Lizard Lunch Linako, or Linako the Disposable Bard), a bard of the 32d verse on the server known as Mithaniel Marr.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, there&#39;s a story behind each of those aka&#39;s. =)<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to exchanging information, stories, or just passing the time of day with everyone here.<br/>
<br/>
(And if I&#39;m lucky, passing my bad luck on to someone else.)  =)<br/>
