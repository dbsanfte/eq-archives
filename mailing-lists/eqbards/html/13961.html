&gt; Ok, now you&#39;re on a slightly different topic - reducing item<br/>
&gt; farming, rather than encouraging dungeon crawling.  The ideas<br/>
&gt; we came up with to encourage dungeon crawling still work in<br/>
&gt; the above scenario - the L50s have to crawl rather than camp.<br/>
&gt; So I would say that these are orthogonal problems that can be<br/>
&gt; solved separately.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Crawling or camping, either way the key is that you have to get them out of<br/>
the level 30 dungeons some how.  Hell, for that matter, you got to get them<br/>
out of some of the level 40+ dungeons!  Nothing is more annoying then to<br/>
call a camp check in Lower Guk, get no response about the<br/>
assassin/supplier... fight your way there just to find a level 50 anything<br/>
sitting there camping the room.  Some areas are built for level 46-50, like<br/>
the frenzied and the lord and some are built for the low 40&#39;s or high 30&#39;s<br/>
like the assassin, but it sure doesn&#39;t stop the 50&#39;s from camping them.<br/>
What is the root of the problem that we are ultimately trying to solve here?<br/>
A combination of over crowding and item farming.  I don&#39;t think talking<br/>
about dungeon crawling buys you a darn thing until you eliminate Item<br/>
Farming and Over Crowding... and once you&#39;ve done that I think you&#39;ll find<br/>
that the discussion about camping vs. dungeon crawling becomes rather<br/>
meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been taught to solve the root problem and not the symptoms.<br/>
It&#39;s the only real solution.<br/>
