<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To further clarify, the reason that we died was we <br/>
&gt;had the spawns for all three camps split up perfectly<br/>
<br/>
&gt;with the Necro.  When the necro left, it took up a <br/>
&gt;lot longer to kill the lord and a wizzie spawned at <br/>
&gt;the end of our battle and started to Ice Comet us... <br/>
 </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>
Wow it took over 10 minutes to kill the lord? <br/>
Something&#39;s very not normal sounding here.  I&#39;d guess<br/>
the 3 spawns weren&#39;t staggered evenly or something<br/>
else screwy happened...oh well. :(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In addition, we could not re-break the spawn once we <br/>
&gt;complete corpse recovery and the lord and his<br/>
&gt;guards had respawned.  With the necro we broke the <br/>
&gt;room by simply waltzing in, charming, mezzing and <br/>
&gt;then we slapped the lord around like he was a<br/>
&gt;wimpy dervish cutthroat or something... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes no surprise here, necro adds charm or pet and mes<br/>
in addition to great damage...necros are great at the<br/>
breakin. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The necro was infinately more productive then the <br/>
&gt;wizard in this group camping the Lord/Hand/Magi... <br/>
&gt;and yes, I will attest that a Necro&#39;s ability to <br/>
&gt;effect undead and us being in lower guk may have had <br/>
&gt;a lot to do with it...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I never meant to imply that the wizard was more<br/>
productive than the necro...remember i&#39;m the guy who<br/>
doesn&#39;t ever want his group nuking as its too<br/>
inefficient for my tastes.  I&#39;m just surprised that<br/>
there was that big of a difference in holding the<br/>
spawn.  IIRC the smallest/weakest group i&#39;ve done lord<br/>
with was: 50 war, 49 cleric, 48 druid, 50 rogue, 42<br/>
shaman?  Something like that...so I would have thought<br/>
you could hold it just fine with either wiz or necro.<br/>
