<div id="ygrps-yiv-298249123">Seriously though, it stands to reason that the people who are most in tune<br/>
(no pun intended) with digging through the game mechanics are also the ones<br/>
who will inevitably experience the most aggravation as the &#39;truth&#39; is<br/>
revealed.  Not the black helicopter truth but the QA tested truth.  This<br/>
kind of dedication takes time and energy, most often it doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
reciprocated.<br/>
<br/>
I think I can safely say that we like this game more than Verant does at<br/>
this point.  I think EQ is like Verant&#39;s teen-ager now.  It was cute and<br/>
cuddly when it was a baby but now it is difficult, distant, frequently<br/>
disrespectful, but still has to be fed it and had a roof put over its head.<br/>
;-P<br/>
<br/>
I respect Harmonic and his positive input to this list far outweighs our own<br/>
inability to accept the occasional frustration that goes along with it.<br/>
<br/>
I would not be able to play my bard to the degree that I am able today<br/>
without the input from this list because quite simply I do not have the<br/>
desire to QA it, I just want to play.  Nearly everything I know about the<br/>
bard and its tricks that I use from day to day came from this list and this<br/>
list alone.<br/>
<br/>
When one is passionate about something, well, one is passionate about it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Funny, it actually makes me feel like I want to leave work <br/>
&gt; right now and go<br/>
&gt; &gt; home and play, like some kind of reverse psychology.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think I am experiencing an negative reality inversion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Shhh, I&#39;m secretly employeed by Verant and using all these proven<br/>
&gt;   techniques to make you all shell out more money and keep playing<br/>
&gt;   the game ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   /tell Aradune how much money do I get again for doing this?<br/>
