<div id="ygrps-yiv-543073163"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I made level 50 after 9 months, Verant suggested it would take 12<br/>
&gt;   months to make level 50.  I guess I&#39;m smarter than the average<br/>
&gt;   bard.  But clumping me in the powergamers cliq is your own false<br/>
&gt;   take on this.  If you&#39;re looking for someone to blame, don&#39;t look<br/>
&gt;   this way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   All I can tell you right now is your tune will change.  Mine did.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Congratulations.  I truly wish I had your luck, skill, free time... or<br/>
whatever the difference between your 50 and my 37.  But, I believe you&#39;ve<br/>
misunderstood me.  The only comparison I made with your statement and that<br/>
of a powergamer is being selfish.  I don&#39;t equate fast leveler with<br/>
powergamer.  Maybe some residual irritation of the guy in BB carried over<br/>
here?  Which, btw, his comments about you having no business in BB at level<br/>
50 sound familiar to a certain statement about a level 25-30 having no<br/>
business in lguk.  There is no blame that I attribute to you at all, nor to<br/>
any level 50, powergamer or not.  Each person is free to play the game as<br/>
they wish and go where they&#39;re able.  Verant is responsible for the<br/>
overcrowding problems, NOT a level 30 player in lguk.<br/>
<br/>
If I sent that tell to you in BB, I would have been curious as to what a<br/>
level 50 can find to do in BB... not as a &quot;Get out of my zone!&quot;, but as a<br/>
&quot;Is there something I don&#39;t know about here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or, more than likely,<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have said a word.  A level 50 is free to travel anywhere they<br/>
choose in the game.  As is a level 25 even if he _is_ due for a fast death,<br/>
barring obvious Verant imposed restrictions (Planes).<br/>
<br/>
As far as my tune changing, if you mean I will start to look at those who<br/>
haven&#39;t made it to my level as not deserving of playing in my favorite<br/>
hunting ground, then you are sorely mistaken.  No matter how crowded it<br/>
gets, that is an attitude I will never carry.  I may petition and complain<br/>
to Verant, but _never_ even think someone else is less deserving of being<br/>
there than me.  Until Verant fixes it, it&#39;s a problem we will all share.<br/>
