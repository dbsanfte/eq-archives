<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903426104">After playing a bard in beta P4, and then in commercial up to<br/>
level 13, I decided I needed a break.<br/>
<br/>
Just for the thrill of it, I joined Rallos Zek (PvP).  During the<br/>
peak times, this server is near the top, but right near the<br/>
bottom during off-times.<br/>
As for crowded newbie areas, I have seen none of that problem<br/>
around Oggok (Ogre home town).<br/>
<br/>
And my personal opinion is that you must be PvP to role-play<br/>
correctly.  Of course, our definitions of role-playing may<br/>
differ, and you are free to disagree (may start an interesting<br/>
thread on just what is role-playing).<br/>
<br/>
I also find that a good number of people I have encountered are<br/>
role-playing to a certain degree.  Not all-out hell-for-leather<br/>
role playing, but not just acting themselves, either.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is easier to role play an Ogre eg.<br/>
I&#39;m out of food and water, going to town to get some.<br/>
vs<br/>
Me hungry.  Get food.  You want?<br/>
