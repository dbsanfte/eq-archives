I felt it was time for a refresher.  <br/>

<br/>
And because of surprising response to the survey we sent out,  I have set up an IRC chat<br/>
and have decided on an every other Friday schedule at 10PM EST.  Please come and talk<br/>
with your fellow bards.  BTW I set up the room using Microsoft Chat.<br/>
