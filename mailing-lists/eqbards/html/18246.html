&gt;     Anyway - I tried Screeching a Green Mountain Giant in Frontier Mountains<br/>
&gt; and Screech basically completely didn&#39;t work.  No resist messages - just<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t take place.  I was close enough to the Mountain to get hit by it -<br/>
&gt; but he was far enough away (due to Height Obviously) to be immune to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I recall using Screech many levels ago against one of the &quot;oon&quot; named<br/>
&gt; Ogres (I forget which one) in my mid 20&#39;s - and it worked nicely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I think this is a problem we should have Verant look into.  I even tried<br/>
&gt; to get RIGHT next to the Giant and sing it.  Equipped the Brass and it still<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t work...<br/>
