&gt; If you don&#39;t mind my asking, just where the heck do you FIND seven HGs.  In the<br/>

At the risk of having my favorite spot suddenly overrun by bards, here<br/>
it is: North Karana. Now, usually, I can find 2 HGs, put them together,<br/>
zone to clear aggro and go hunt wisps for a bit and wait for another to<br/>
pop, but something wonderful happenned yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
I found my 2 HGs, let them fight. During the fight I saw ANOTHER<br/>
wandering near. As soon as my HG won, I turned this new HG onto mine,<br/>
(very quick fight).  Then, as I was heading for the zone, what do I see<br/>
but ANOTHER one. I circle back to pick up my friend, and go after him.<br/>
VERY close fight where I switched pets twice, then bang, mine wins.<br/>
Guess what? I&#39;m left with a Yellow HG whose health bar is down so low I<br/>
can&#39;t even see red. So I figure what the heck, I move in for melee. <br/>
<br/>
Whack! for 98 points<br/>
Whack! for 98 points<br/>
You are stunned!<br/>
Whack for 78 points!<br/>
Whack for 92 points!<br/>
You are stunned!<br/>
Whack for 43 points!<br/>
A HG tries to hit you but you DODGE!<br/>
You slash a HG for 1 point!<br/>
You bash a HG for 1 point!<br/>
A HG flees in terror!<br/>
You miss!<br/>
You miss!<br/>
A HG winces!<br/>
A HG says &quot;hit by non-melee 48 points of damage&quot;<br/>
A HG&#39;s brain begins to smolder (thank you staff of writhing)<br/>
You have slain a HG!<br/>
<br/>
So having totally depleted the HGs in NK, I heal up, and head for EK, up<br/>
on the hill between the HHP ramp and the barb village are somtimes HGs.<br/>
I find two blue ones and send them at it. A close fight again, and then<br/>
I move in on winner. He whiffs me TWICE, then is a helpless prisoner as<br/>
I fear, DDD, fear(resist), fear(resist), fear, DDD, whacking all the<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Back to NK, where I find a HG and a griffon awaiting my arrival. (BTW,<br/>
HG blue, griffon yellow, HG wins) I take my HG for a run (across<br/>
northern part away from peoples and track a blue griffenne. WHACK. Then<br/>
it starts raining and I almost run right into a HG. We (me and my<br/>
HG)decide we can take him, and we start. a Helpful level 45 or so wiz<br/>
decides to help me out as I am obviously running for my life from TWO<br/>
HGs. and starts blasting the (non-charmed) HG. <br/>
<br/>
btw, what can you do here? I mean, as we discussed earlier, you can&#39;t<br/>
send the wizard a private /tell saying &quot;pardon me, but I am charming the<br/>
HGs to fight against each other. when it wears off it looks like I am in<br/>
trouble, but I am not, thank you for your concern&quot; because you get to<br/>
&quot;/tel... and the HG would be on you. (since you can&#39;t autorun backwards<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he figures out what is going on once he roots one and mine<br/>
starts whacking on it. he /tells &quot;me oh, sorry, charm&quot;. I do /r &quot;yes,<br/>
want winner?&quot;, he sends &quot;sure&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And that is how I got 7 HGs in two hours. With over 200plat in cash and<br/>
prizes. <br/>
HG resist rate: 50%<br/>
Number of times I got hit(while not in melee): twice<br/>
Average money: ~26pp <br/>
Lowest money: 2pp<br/>
Highest money: 54pp<br/>
Number of lambent stones: 0<br/>
XP gained: Hardly any from charm victories, more from melee, total: 1/4<br/>
to 1/2 bubble.<br/>
