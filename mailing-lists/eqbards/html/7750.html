<div id="ygrps-yiv-992616700">Dude do you even read what people say? He said at &quot;high levels&quot;. Next time<br/>
be more careful before you flame. you only have to put up with the bind<br/>
issue for a little while. This game is for people who have lotso f time on<br/>
their hands like I said before. Verant made the game that way which is why<br/>
melee classes have to run so far. Deal with it or move on.<br/>

&gt;&gt; group playing in lower guk.  bard dies.  cleric<br/>
&gt;&gt; resses bard.  have a nice day.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; if you don&#39;t have a cleric in your group in lower<br/>
&gt;&gt; guk (or anywhere for that matter in high level<br/>
&gt;&gt; dungeons), then you should expect to die often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re assuming that you are of a level to group with<br/>
&gt;a level 29 cleric. Let&#39;s go with what you said above.<br/>
&gt;&quot;if you dont have a cleric you should<br/>
&gt;expect to die often.&quot; (paraphrased of course)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, because there&#39;s no cleric in my group, or because<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not high enough level to group with a level 29<br/>
&gt;cleric - I should be expected to run through 6+ zones<br/>
&gt;back to my corpse while a wizard can bind himself right<br/>
&gt;outside of the dungeon or place we&#39;re in? I still don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;see the logic. All classes should be able to be bound<br/>
&gt;in the same places as any other class can. That&#39;s all<br/>
&gt;there is to it.<br/>
