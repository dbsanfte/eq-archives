<div id="ygrps-yiv-934234395">Actually, I believe GZ has admitted that dex does<br/>
nothing in helping recovery from interruption by<br/>
casters.  Recover from interruption is entirely based<br/>
on the channeling skill, contrary to what most casters<br/>
perceive.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note people have asked whether the dex makes<br/>
a difference in missed notes.  I do believe it does. <br/>
I went even from 124 or so to 112 and feel like I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed a difference.  This could be all in my head as<br/>
well.  My missed notes, however, occur in bundles.  It<br/>
is rarely one here and one there.  It is usually 3-5<br/>
missed notes all in a group.  Followed by relatively<br/>
long periods of no missed notes.  So I&#39;m thinking maby<br/>
my &quot;bundles&quot; just got bigger.  Maybe before I would<br/>
have 1-3 missed notes in a row and now it is 3-5.  <br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

&gt; Nope you&#39;re right.  Dex does nothing for speed.  All<br/>
&gt; dex does is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)  Affects dmg for bows<br/>
&gt; 2)  Affects dmg for thrown  (not told but determined<br/>
&gt; through experience)<br/>
&gt; 3)  Affects chance of crits/cripple<br/>
&gt; 4)  Increases chance of a weapon processing it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; effect<br/>
&gt; 5)  Decreases song missed note rate<br/>
&gt; 6)  Helps casters recover from interruption<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thats it<br/>
<br/>
