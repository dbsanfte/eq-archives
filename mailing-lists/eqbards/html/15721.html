<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649843509">I think some of the comments I read illustrate the differences between<br/>
younger servers and more matures ones.  For instance on mine (Nameless), you<br/>
can call sav/exec/sage/cav and no one will contest you, the BR means you get<br/>
EVERYTHING from the GIBS to the spiders to the gargs.  Or call the entire<br/>
live side keep (which is, IMHO, incredibly fun for a full group of 6, there<br/>
is no camping involved you move in and around to all the spawns, rest up for<br/>
the king if you&#39;re feeling good, then repeat).  An enchanter is definatly a<br/>
necessity in this situation, and it leads to some great tactics (AE spells +<br/>
AE stun are vastly overlooked given the super low mana cost of enchanter<br/>
stun and the dam:mana ratio of the wiz AE&#39;s, another is the bard hat trick:<br/>
pixie one mob, charm a second and sic it on a 3rd).  Taking 14 frogs at<br/>
once: took 9+ RL minutes and drained countless stamina bars but it was tons<br/>
of fun and to those people that can&#39;t try it on crowded servers I&#39;m very<br/>
sorry. =(  I can only hope Verant quickly addresses growing server<br/>
populations; since the game is entirly different when its played without the<br/>
safety in numbers effect of overcrowding.<br/>
