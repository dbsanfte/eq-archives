Best thing I&#39;ve found is group with a druid that will<br/>
cast Harmony (AOE lull that works *MUCH* better than<br/>
LL) and reduce the number of dervs pulled.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t sing until the other members have hurt<br/>
the mobs plenty, they don&#39;t all aggro you...but you&#39;re<br/>
also less effective.  Maybe Lullaby is the best<br/>
answer...but I won&#39;t know till I&#39;m 15th lvl.<br/>
