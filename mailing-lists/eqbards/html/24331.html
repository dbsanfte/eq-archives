&gt;I am a student at Queen&#39;s University in Canada who is taking part in<br/>
&gt;a research project that is studying Everquest.  After spending<br/>
&gt;numerous hours (or perhaps months would be a better way to put it!)<br/>
&gt;playing the game we have put together a brief survey, which should<br/>
&gt;take no more than ten minutes to complete.  We are trying to get a<br/>
&gt;better understanding of the relationships which develop in the vast<br/>
&gt;land of Norrath.  If you are interested in participating merely cut<br/>
