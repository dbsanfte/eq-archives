<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146046601">I&#39;m sure someone&#39;s done this, but the other day I was recovering my corpse<br/>
in Mistmoore, looted my Minotaur Horn, sang Shauri&#39;s, and finished looting<br/>
everything else, including putting my Runed Bone Fork into my ranged weapon<br/>
slot.<br/>
<br/>
The Runed Bone Fork, replaced the graphic of my horn, and left me looking<br/>
like I was standing around writhing, holding a spear which was sticking out<br/>
the back of my head!<br/>
<br/>
Not so much of an Easter Egg as a bug, but it was amusing.<br/>
