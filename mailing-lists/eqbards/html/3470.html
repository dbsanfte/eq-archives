<div id="ygrps-yiv-878742565">No I think you&#39;d find people of more appropriate level there, and half the<br/>
people in BlackBurrow would be there too since there are plenty of low level<br/>
gnolls there.  In general it is binding more than anything that is keeping<br/>
people from spreading out the way Brad wants them too.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
uninteresting treasure, they just go get that when they know they can&#39;t die<br/>
there, then complain because it is trivial to them at that level.  Binding<br/>
keeps people close to cites, try playing at a non-prime time like I do many<br/>
times when there are only 600 people on-line.  getting bound anywhere isn&#39;t<br/>
just a pain, its often impossible.  I was unable to find anyone even capable<br/>
of binding on all of faydwyr one morning, and so packed it in since a 40<br/>
minute boat trip to recover a corpse is ridiculous.  this is my one and only<br/>
real peeve with EQ, binding is given out as a &#39;skill&#39;, when in reality<br/>
without adventuring can become ridiculously difficult, simply because there<br/>
are not enough people playing.  That is unacceptable.<br/>

I agree with you that it is a matter of balance, but I think it should go<br/>
the<br/>
other way. I think casters should only be able to bind themselves to cities.<br/>
If<br/>
everyone could be bound anywhere there&#39;d be no reward for risking trips to<br/>
out<br/>
of the way places (like Guk). I routinely spend time in Splitpaw dungeon<br/>
which<br/>
is about a 20-25 minute walk from the nearest bind point. But because of<br/>
this it<br/>
is rare to see more than 10 people in there. If anyone could be bound right<br/>
outside the entrance it would be just like Blackburrow, Crushbone, et.al.<br/>
