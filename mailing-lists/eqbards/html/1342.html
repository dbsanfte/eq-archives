 </span></blockquote>The int only helps you with learning skills.  Bards level<br/>
slowly so you&#39;ll have plenty of time learn skills.  I&#39;d say<br/>
concentrate on agility (bards are a mob magnet, so it helps to<br/>
avoid being hit).  Put a little into dex (supposedly helps<br/>
being knocked out of a song), or chr (helps your charm-type<br/>
songs, better prices), or str (carry more stuff) as you see<br/>
fit.  Sta is generally considered a waste.<br/>
<br/>
The only rationale I see for increasing your int in a non-mage<br/>
type character is if you&#39;re planning to take up an expensive<br/>
trade skill.<br/>
