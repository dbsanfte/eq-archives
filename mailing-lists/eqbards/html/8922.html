&gt;If these mino guards were blue to a level 50, they&#39;ve been changed <br/>
&gt;recently.<br/>
&gt;I was there last week with most of my guild, trying to get Meldrath&#39;s skull<br/>
&gt;for a few of our rangers.  The mino guards con&#39;d green to me at 47, and<br/>
&gt;yellow to one of our Paladin&#39;s in his 20&#39;s.  Meldrath con&#39;d blue however,<br/>
&gt;and I&#39;d say high blue from how hard he&#39;d hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeh they definitely changed em - like I said this was about 3 weeks ago. I&#39;m <br/>
48th and back then the only thing to get xp from in Steamfont (besides <br/>
Watchmen) was the mino guards. Meldrath and the mino hero (the reason I was <br/>
there) were both pushovers. I had heard they made Meldrath part of a quest <br/>
and upped his level.<br/>
