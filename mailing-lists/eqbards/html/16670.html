solo HGs a LOT and I&#39;ve NEVER dumped a giant on a group.  Your pet is doing<br/>
ungodly dmg to that giant it&#39;s attacking (80-100hp/shot) it&#39;s VERY pissed at<br/>
you when the charm drops.  On top of that your PET is very pissed when charm<br/>
drops as well.   As a result, unless somone ATTACKS one of the giants you&#39;re<br/>
working on you aren&#39;t going to &quot;Train&quot; anyone when doing this.<br/>
