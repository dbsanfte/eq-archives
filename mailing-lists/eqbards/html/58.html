<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127506153">Greetings and well met Brothers and Sisters of the art.<br/>
I bid thee all well.  I find the talk of charging for<br/>
corpse retrieval a rather gruesome buisness.  I would<br/>
remind ye my brothers and sisters that we cannot long<br/>
strike out on our own and engendering ill will by <br/>
charging for our aid, while economical for us perhaps<br/>
at lower levels will most certainly turn poor later.<br/>
Remember there are many music critics to start with,<br/>
to inspire more is folly. <br/>
<br/>
I find that merely volunteering my aid often allows <br/>
a reward of often great sums.  What&#39;s more as they <br/>
give of themselves many seek me out later an offer <br/>
their aid for something I need or have not.. many<br/>
a party have I found myself desired in comprised of<br/>
such companions.  My advise dear fellows of the art<br/>
charge nothing.. if one treats you poorly remember <br/>
and spread the word especially to this list.  In days<br/>
of yore in the world we call the real world.  Bards were<br/>
of the druidic order and kept lore of all the families..<br/>
it was said better a thousand deaths then the scorn of a <br/>
bard.  Let us bring such truth to Norrath as well.. be<br/>
merciful to all... and let us truely create the lore<br/>
good and bad of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
Good fortune to ye all.. May you all be worthy of song.<br/>
