<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080343659">Just wanted to share my love for Bards, last night in the Oasis, i had<br/>
just entered the zone when i saw this /shout: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Party of 5 looking for 6th member, 17-19th Bards prefered&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I joined immediately and was the toast of the group. We hunted orcs and<br/>
everyone loved me, I was the puller, speeding them (and we had a shaman<br/>
in the group too, but they prefered selo&#39;s), buffing, healing,  I saved<br/>
the party at least 3 times by kiting 3-4 mobs while my party killed a<br/>
couple off then returning to finish the extras. And i even got &quot;I didn&#39;t<br/>
know bards could do that&quot; when i used Lugubrious Lamet to lull some mobs<br/>
so we could pull less.<br/>
<br/>
While i was fighting i got THREE direct /tells from people i didn&#39;t know<br/>
asking me to join their party. I love being a bard.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, i didn&#39;t have much luck using Lucid Lullaby. The mobs<br/>
didn;t sleep long and woke up quite angry with me, although it was nice<br/>
to be able to taunt them off our 2 casters when needed.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the only healers in party were Shaman and Paladin, the Paladin<br/>
used LoH once (on me) but otherwise we took all orcs easily (even when<br/>
we took 4-5 with 2 of them being yellow to me at 18th)<br/>
<br/>
Just a note to inspire those younger bards out there. Stick with it, you<br/>
can make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Uldar, 18th Bard, Innoruk<br/>
Jerico, 24th SK<br/>
Aloren, 17th Druid<br/>
Salla, 15th Rogue<br/>
and many more</div>
