&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also play a Level 38 druid (no, I don&#39;t kite, or I probably WOULD be<br/>
&gt; level 50 by now).  I have played her since day one of commercial.  In<br/>
&gt; all that time, I have grouped with exactly THREE bards.  Not because I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like grouping with bards, but simply because there are so few of them<br/>
&gt; available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I had the opportunity and the unexpected pleasure of grouping<br/>
&gt; with a level 30 bard in Cazic. *waves to Celandro*  We were doing crocs<br/>
&gt; and praying to the EQ gods for the steel golem to spawn and drop some gloves<br/>
&gt; for our cleric friend.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because I play a bard, I am always more than happy to group with one if <br/>
&gt; possible.  I know the strengths of a bard, I know how great they are to<br/>
&gt; have in a party, but I can tell you, there is nothing like experiencing what<br/>
&gt; a bard can do from a different perspective.  If I could have charmed<br/>
&gt; Celandro and made him my permanent pet, I would have done it! Hehe.  I learned<br/>
&gt; ALOT from Celandro, pestering him with questions (poor Cel!), watching him<br/>
&gt; weave his songs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No PC charming is a bard and enchanter skill.. gained at level 29 by<br/>
enchanters and at level 32 by bards... Like I told you last night.. im<br/>
going to make my group always say &quot;As you command master&quot;<br/>

&gt; -Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After this group broke up, I joined one of the best groups I have ever<br/>
been in.  We had me, a warrior, a shadow knight, a paladin, a ranger and a<br/>
shaman all level 30-34 and we were fighting in the throne room.  I was<br/>
using Pixie Strike (my new favoirte song), Lullaby, Anthem, Hymn, Psalm of<br/>
Cooling and Constant Chain depending on the situation and we were the only<br/>
group there for a few hours.  We cleared both floors of the house and had<br/>
about a 5 minute break before things started respawning.  It was simply<br/>
amazing... We handled some insane pulls (2 heralds, 1 justicar, 1 monkey,<br/>
1 zealot, 1 fanatic), never started a train, never died, and gained a lot<br/>
of experience (a bubble and a half of level 30 in 4 hours) and cash (100pp<br/>
after selling the 10 fine steel weapons I got).  Best of all.. i never<br/>
unequipped my lute :).<br/>
The tactics for various situations were:<br/>
1 non-caster: twist Anthem, Hymn and Psalm of Cooling.  If the ranger<br/>
couldnt snare it, Chain it when it starts to run.<br/>
1 caster: Pixie Strike over and over and over to interrupt the spells.<br/>
This is very effective against the shaman we were fighting as it stopped<br/>
the heals.<br/>
2 non casters: Pixie Strike until it succeeds, then Hymn, repeat.  Keep<br/>
the mob that isnt being attacked messed and still heal everyone.. Save<br/>
that shaman mana. When one dies, switch to the 1 mob scenario<br/>
2 casters or mixed: Lullaby over and over again.  This will interrupt the<br/>
caster(s) and keep one mob sleeped most of the time. When 1 dies, switch<br/>
to the 1 mob scenario<br/>
3 or more: Lullaby over and over again. Most mobs are sleeping which<br/>
helps when there are multiple healers.<br/>
For these tactics to work you MUST teach everyone to /assist the puller.<br/>
It usually takes about 30 minutes to convince the meleers who arent used<br/>
to grouping with an enchanter or a bard to usually ignore the mobs who go<br/>
for the shaman or the new mob that just spawned and joined in and let me<br/>
handle it. So drill it into their heads:<br/>
&quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot; (this happened twice last night<br/>
and I couldnt mesmerize the mob off the dotter.. he learned)<br/>
and best of all when you first join the group or when someone new joins...<br/>
&quot;Hello my name is Celandro Spellsong and I will be your substitute<br/>
enchanter for the night.  Adjust your play accordingly.&quot;<br/>
