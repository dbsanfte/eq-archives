<div id="ygrps-yiv-845695694">I personally consider going through HH to be quicker than River, Misty,<br/>
Runny, Gorge.  The zone loading time is the factor (IMO).<br/>
<br/>
Qeynos to Freeport in 20 minutes?  Kind of a stretch, if you ask me.  With<br/>
the MM battledrum, perhaps in 25.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Why would the trip from Qeynos to Freeport take 45<br/>
&gt; &gt; minutes? With selo&#39;s you can easily make it in 20.<br/>
<br/>
Watch your quotes.  I didn&#39;t write this.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; We discussed this in a previous thread.  He suffers from<br/>
&gt; &gt; enormous lag (500-600 ms) which causes him to Selo-run<br/>
&gt; &gt; almost as slow as normal people run, and makes for 4-6<br/>
&gt; &gt; minute zone times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re obviously thinking of someone else. You claimed in<br/>
&gt; one of your replies that I must have a lot of lag. I never<br/>
&gt; said that, nor agreed with you. I have cable modem service<br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t have 500-600 ms lag. I don&#39;t &quot;selo-run almost<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, must&#39;ve been someone else then.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; as slow as normal people run&quot;. My average ping is about<br/>
&gt; 150 and my average zone time is around a minute.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you think you can make it from Qeynos to Freeport in<br/>
&gt; 20 minutes I&#39;d love to see you do it.<br/>
<br/>
Dunno about 20 minutes.  I&#39;m pretty sure I could do it in 25.<br/>
I made it from Freeport to the centaur village and back in a<br/>
half hour.  I&#39;ll have to try timing a run to Qeynos (adds the<br/>
long run through WK, which is why I don&#39;t think I could do it<br/>
in 20).  I need to find out which is faster time-wise anyway -<br/>
going through Highpass and taking the long ramp down in EK, or<br/>
going through Rivervale/Misty/Beholder&#39;s.<br/>
