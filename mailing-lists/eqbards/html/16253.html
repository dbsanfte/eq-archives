As far as the rest of the topic goes, i would definitely take (given the<br/>
opportunity) the best *player* available into my group, regardless of if that<br/>
gave me a group of 5 rogues and a wizard. I do recognize the merits of<br/>
discussing the optimal group composition (especially for bards, since we really<br/>
are a meta class (our optimal functionality is improving the other group<br/>
members)) but i have been in situations (and i am sure that we all have) where<br/>
you get the right *class* in your group, only to discover that the person is<br/>
either ignorant, or agressively stupid.  <br/>
<br/>
Example of agressively stupid:  Grouped in Mistmoore...23 bard (me) 22 warrior,<br/>
23 rogue, 24 monk, 24 enc, 24 dru.<br/>
--after the 2nd fight (in which the bard, warrior die) we discover that this is<br/>
not your &quot;standard equipment&quot; druid...he informs us (mid fight) that he is not<br/>
a: Cleric (ie-won&#39;t heal), Mage (won&#39;t Damage Shield), ranger (won&#39;t Snare), or<br/>
bard/shaman (won&#39;t buff or SOW)...he is convinced that he is most efficient<br/>
tanking and nuking.  I am reasonably certain when he gets to 29, he will say<br/>
&quot;i&#39;m not a taxi either&quot;..grr.<br/>
<br/>
as far as my &quot;optimal&quot; group, assuming all players are equal :/ ...i would have<br/>
to say Warrior (preferably a fat one),  Monk, Cleric, Enchanter, Dr00d (sorry),<br/>
Bard.  (i would also like a member of said group to have a friend who is a<br/>
shaman that can make shrink potions, and a mage to summon bandages.....but i<br/>
suppose that those are not necessary)  I think that this configuration gives<br/>
the group everything it needs (except bandages and shrink) and some redundancy<br/>
in some areas as a safety factor. (2 people with snare-like object, 2 people<br/>
with crowd control, 2 people with nukes, 2 ppl with healing (not counting<br/>
bard).<br/>
as always, your mileage may vary :)<br/>
&lt;/Ramble&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
