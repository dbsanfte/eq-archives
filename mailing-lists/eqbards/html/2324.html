<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-277355229">After so many kills the Avatar of the creature comes. For example: Someone<br/>
is camping the Highhold orcs for 7 hours, looking for that particular item.<br/>
The party has killed NUMEROUS orc fanatics, each one a servant to the orcs<br/>
god. The god notices the death of &#39;its&#39; subject. The god sends an avatar to<br/>
destroy those that are killing his worshippers. In comes The Shralok Avatar.<br/>
It takes names. It kicks butt. If the party zones, he will disappear until<br/>
anyone from that party comes back to that area. After a certain length of<br/>
time, it is safe to come back and camp the area some more to get another of<br/>
a particular item. Until the avatar shows up again. <br/>
<br/>
Its only a suggestion :)</div>
