<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406701133">Well, I probably would have gone to it as well, unfortunately I didn&#39;t hear <br/>
about the event until it had already been over for some time.  Even <br/>
EQ.Stratics had the message about the event posted on it&#39;s site a good 7 <br/>
hours after the event was over.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we should try this again and plan it well in advance...  How about <br/>
NEXT Sunday (ie. Sept. 24).<br/>

&gt;Well, I was late - but I was there.  Not much turnout from what I heard, so<br/>
&gt;perhaps we can get together with the other mailing lists and the message<br/>
&gt;boards and the news pages and get some more support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not like it does any good :P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW - for those interested, I&#39;ve updated my EQ Commands page - a listing of<br/>
&gt;all available / commands in Everquest.  You can find it at<br/>
