Stone Spider room. We were there the other night.  One of the rangers was<br/>
scrambling frantically to try to mem snare for a LavaDuctCrawler.  Don&#39;t<br/>
bother.  It only runs to the foot of the ramp to the lair and stops there.<br/>
Soon enough you begin to anticipate his &quot;break&quot; and try to run over and beat<br/>
him there. But this is the  exception.  I remember lots of other places<br/>
where &quot;no runners&quot; was the rule to live (or die) by.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting a Greater Kobold that wandered thru...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Should I just fear him and see what he can pull for us?&quot;<br/>

p.s. I did that in the bat room once in an emergency (feared off a couple<br/>
bats).  Heh, they pulled an imp.  Emergency soon became near disaster. We<br/>
zoned.<br/>
