<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836315083">I have about 4 of these horns, but don&#39;t have the skill to use them yet.  I<br/>
keep seeing them sold for a gold or two in stores, can&#39;t resist picking a<br/>
few up (heard folks trying to sell them for platinum).  When I right-click,<br/>
I am informed it can only be used by a bard and that it is magical.  I&#39;m<br/>
just wondering what the magical effect is?  Anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not certain if it is wind or brass.  A horn, I assume, is a brass<br/>
instrument type.  Of course this can be easily tested, simply by<br/>
seeing an effect while wielding it with different songs.  Just buy<br/>
it from a store, find yourself,  but not from someone for platinum!<br/>

&gt;As I recently achieved a level that allows me to begin sharpening my<br/>
&gt;skills on wind instruments, I will be looking to acquire a proper<br/>
&gt;instrument shortly. I have heard that Minotaur Horns may be used for<br/>
&gt;this purpose, and as an avid hunter of these great snorting beasts I<br/>
&gt;think using one would be quite appropriate. I would just like to verify<br/>
&gt;that this is indeed the case - that a Minotaur Horn IS a wind instrument<br/>
&gt;- and humbly ask of those senior to myself.... is there a performance<br/>
&gt;difference between such a horn and an instrument that one would buy in a<br/>
