&gt; &gt; Langeseax and dragoon dirk ahve same stats right? so why was one worth<br/>
&gt; &gt; 100 plat when the other was worth 20? (dirk has been going back up<br/>
&gt; &gt; recently, it seems to be rather rare)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The 1h Langseax is slightly better, 6/22 vs. 6/23 for the<br/>
&gt; dirk.<br/>
<br/>
Actually the Langseax is 6/23..so with the added DEX/SV on the Dirk it is<br/>
the better weapon.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The dirk had an incorrect treasure table entry and<br/>
&gt; D&#39;vinn was dropping it every time for about two months.<br/>
&gt; Since D&#39;vinn spawned about once every 20 minutes, that was<br/>
&gt; about 50+ new dirks added to the world every day.  With such a<br/>
&gt; huge supply and fixed demand, the price plummeted to 15-30pp.<br/>
&gt; Ever since it&#39;s been fixed so he drops it about 1 in 10 times,<br/>
&gt; the price has slowly been going up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Langseax is the product of a rather involved quest that<br/>
&gt; takes a couple hours to complete.  Also, a key NPC in the<br/>
&gt; quest is often killed since he sometimes carries an item for<br/>
&gt; another quest.<br/>
<br/>
Another Langseax quest NPC in Everfrost is getting whacked more often now<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve often seen Palgin or Basil walking<br/>
&gt; around in WK, and not killed them because the quest is so<br/>
&gt; involved and I think they only spawn when someone initiates<br/>
&gt; that part of the quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the price difference on these two is mostly a result of<br/>
&gt; supply.<br/>
<br/>
This is true..and the supply of Langseax on my server is huge and getting<br/>
larger every day...causing the price to plummet. </span></blockquote></div>
