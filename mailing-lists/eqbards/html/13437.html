&gt; When I first went to KFC at level 20 or so, I would fall off the Treehouse<br/>
&gt; every single time.  By level 30, I could run to the top selos and drums no<br/>
&gt; problemo!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I run through Lavastorm with Selo&#39;s blasting, beating on my MM drum.  I do this automatically; when I&#39;m<br/>
grouped, I&#39;ve scared the pants off my groupmates doing this!  (They&#39;re wussies - with that kind of speed,<br/>
you run across the lava so fast you often don&#39;t take damage at all.  The night I forgot what I was doing<br/>
and barrelled over the lip of the big lava pit was pretty funny though, I felt like a cartoon character,<br/>
desperately trying to run backwards in midair!)<br/>
