&gt; Hail and well met All,<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ro. If I have a decent group hunting SG for exp, we should have np getting<br/>
&gt; more plans.  (Hey Slyde, was that you with 2 SG&#39;s after you last night? We<br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t sure if we needed to pull them off or not.)<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes that was me - but with Selo&#39;s and my drum - I had no problem staying<br/>
alive &lt;g&gt;..<br/>
<br/>
Actually - I wish I realized you were so generous with help.  The plans are<br/>
my assigned guild quest.  Hopefully I can run into you there soon (I have a<br/>
busy weekend as a RL bard - so if I get on - it will only be early)<br/>
