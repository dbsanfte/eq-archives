<br/>
I don&#39;t have the problem of missing notes that often, but when I do, it<br/>
seems that I miss a lot of them. The other night it took me 6-7 attempts to<br/>
get Selo&#39;s going, which seems like an awful lot of bad random numbers rolls<br/>
to get at one time. Luckily this was a non-combat situtation and it just<br/>
made the rest of my group ridicule me, but hey when you strum a drumstick<br/>
you get used to that sort of thing.<br/>
