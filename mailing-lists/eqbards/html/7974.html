&gt; The thing is that people who are really decked out pretty much understand<br/>
&gt; the ins and outs of every game. As the&#39;ve got a char that is 40+ maybe a<br/>

you can have the kind of intimate understanding that comes<br/>
from having played and died over and over.  Heck, most of the<br/>
people I meet don&#39;t even know what songs/spells the other<br/>
classes have aside from the most commonly used ones.  The only<br/>
people I&#39;ve seen with a good understanding of (most) every<br/>
class and their limits and so forth are the ones who&#39;ve<br/>
somehow had enough time to get four or five diverse characters<br/>
past the mid 20s or so.<br/>
