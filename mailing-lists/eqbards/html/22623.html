<div id="ygrps-yiv-508864302">Our guild loot policy is a lot looser than this.  In my last guild (prior to my new one splitting off), we<br/>
had a point system, but it was too much for anyone to handle, and caused countless bookkeeping complaints.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the policy is to give loot to the character that would best use it to the guild&#39;s advantage.<br/>
Planes loot is handled by class representatives, who have explicit loot orders for all planes capable<br/>
characters.  All other loot is distributed by the guild officers.<br/>
<br/>
All loot won in guild events (greater than 1/2 of the people there are guild members) is guild property,<br/>
and cannot be sold.  If you get a better item, you hand it down.  If there is nobody left to hand it down<br/>
to, it&#39;s sold to raise cash for guild events or bartered to get other items.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the leaders screw up; sometimes they overlook people.  This gets pointed out rather loudly, and<br/>
is usually corrected shortly thereafter.   Yeah, you might not find the same exact item again, but there&#39;s<br/>
plenty of stuff out there to get, so who really cares?<br/>
<br/>
Sylly&#39;s primary/secondary problem is easy.  Whether a player is logged on as his/her primary or secondary,<br/>
the primary is the one that gets loot, as per the guidelines.  The secondaries don&#39;t get loot unless all<br/>
primaries have at least that or better.  This is only an issue when someone is converting a secondary to<br/>
their primary, but that doesn&#39;t happen too often.  Frankly, we&#39;re at the point where a lot of Planes drops<br/>
go to guests.<br/>
<br/>
This only works where the guild is more interested in doing stuff than they are in acquiring stuff.  For<br/>
the most part, this is true for us.  Although we have finished 8 1/2 epic quests (something went wrong for<br/>
one of our Rangers - he only got one of the two swords), that&#39;s just as much a challenge for the guild as<br/>
it is an item acquisition thing for the individuals involved.<br/>

&gt; Best thing to do is go look at their point system:<br/>

&gt; It will answer most of the questions that pop into you head as you think<br/>
&gt; about it. Also, note that the points assigned to mobs maybe updated<br/>
&gt; somewhere internally (ie they have more mobs listed where else - I read that<br/>
&gt; when someone from AL was telling someone else to go there and read it.)  But<br/>
&gt; in general you will see how it works for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I first saw their system - I was a bit taken aback.  But after being in<br/>
&gt; a large guild with a totally different system, I can really see some good<br/>
&gt; value in how they do it.  Our guild&#39;s policy is that loot should go to those<br/>
&gt; who both need it in that they dont have a better item and those who have<br/>
&gt; been trying to get it for the longest time.  Well, that turns into &quot;the<br/>
&gt; oldest guild memebers in the class get all the best things first.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Essentially, everyone goes on most all of our raids and we do not keep and<br/>
&gt; accurate attendance record. So, you have everyone saying: &quot;I have been on<br/>
&gt; every POH/POF/POS, Naggy, Vox, VS, DS, Trak, etc etc since I joined the<br/>
&gt; guild...&quot;  Also, our policy is that primary characters get loot before<br/>
&gt; secondarys.  Well, that becomes problematic when one gets asked to play the<br/>
&gt; secondary because that is what this raid &quot;needs.&quot; So without some point<br/>
&gt; system, who earns credit?  What happens if its your primary&#39;s turn to loot<br/>
&gt; an item and they are not active in the raid? Say you have 3 bards and one is<br/>
&gt; asked to play a cleric for VS raid.  Bard greaves drop. Do you uncamp the<br/>
&gt; primary to loot and item when 2 others of that class were fighting in the<br/>
&gt; raid?  Point systems can address these issues ahead of time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other thing to look at - for those of you who are interested in &#39;what<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s like to be uber&#39; is the minimum equipment requirements to join AL.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Here&#39;s a list of boring greenies we are not gonna camp for you...&quot;  But<br/>
&gt; indeed it is a list that says you are well equipped and ready for a variety<br/>
&gt; situations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of the other &#39;uber&#39; guilds on our server has a loot policy that says<br/>
&gt; loot goes to the oldest and highest level players first.  Their focus is on<br/>
&gt; level and they leveled as many as possible to 60 as soon as possible.  That<br/>
&gt; did put them in good shpe to be doing Trak first and VS and they have been<br/>
&gt; first ones in our server to go to VP.  Their focus is different - to them<br/>
&gt; level is the number one thing.<br/>
