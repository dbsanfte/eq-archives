<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339192602">I have been a Bard in Freeport for a long time and have trained under<br/>
Caskin Marshead for all of my 5 (soon to be 6) Levels. and he has not given<br/>
me the time of day so far. the same holds for the rest of the Freeport&#39;s<br/>
Bards guild. But I have found quests from the Palatines in the Hall of Truth<br/>
(which will get one in hot water with the Freeport Militia and a search for<br/>
a blade called &#39;Soulfire&#39;) and the priests of the Temple of Marr (better get<br/>
your sea legs ready it may require a LONG boat trip)..<br/>

    Hello friends and fellow adventurers, my name is Talonstar, A not so<br/>
numble bard from the dimension of E&#39;ci.  I have one question.  Has anyone<br/>
received a quest from the guildmaster (Caskin Marsheart) in freeport?</div>
