Well, the general impression from several group members that I have had, is<br/>
that Jig dramatically increases the speed of mana regen.  An informal timing<br/>
(without stopwatch) went like this:<br/>
empty mana bar<br/>
two bubbles filled, no song<br/>
start jig<br/>
three bubbles filled, in about the same length of time as the first two<br/>
<br/>
three or four different meditators have reported this effect to me.  So, I<br/>
have taken to running restoration until heals are nearly to, or all the way<br/>
to full, then switching to jig, to get the spellcasters mana up quickly.  My<br/>
impression is that there is a fair amount of speed increase.  (I have also<br/>
been using the forage timer for some of this - i.e. click on forage, start<br/>
song, wait for forage to stop, compare with not having song running)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to get some guys in my guild to do some more extensive testing,<br/>
with stopwatches, this week, and report the results.  Oh, yeah, if this<br/>
works the way I think it does, by shorting out the timer on meding, then<br/>
level/skill should not matter at all.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Er, back to my original question about Jig and Mana, sorry.<br/>
&gt; Has anyone done<br/>
&gt; &gt; any definitive tests on this?  With all my bard songs I have<br/>
&gt; been able to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only close-to-definitive test I&#39;ve done was with a cleric<br/>
&gt; friend who said she&#39;d already timed how meditation worked.<br/>
&gt; She said she normally got a meditation pulse every ~8 eseconds.<br/>
&gt; With the jig, she said she got it every ~6 seconds.  This is<br/>
&gt; one of the more difficult things to test since you need a<br/>
&gt; partner who is as sharp as you are at this type of thing (and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure the cleric was, although she said she was using a<br/>
&gt; stopwatch, so...).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My guess as to why people are saying bard songs slow mana<br/>
&gt; regen down is because Restoration tends to fill up the health<br/>
&gt; bar so quickly, and they&#39;re used to comparing their mana regen<br/>
&gt; with their health regen.  Suddenly the health is shooting up<br/>
&gt; there while the mana appears to lag behind.<br/>
