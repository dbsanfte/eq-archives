&gt; Is this true?  I am often with groups that include 3 or more casters, so <br/>
&gt; power-medding during battle is common, and they have me play mana song <br/>
&gt; constantly.  None of them have mentioned anything like this.<br/>

seemed to only start happening after the specialization stuff went in<br/>
recently) but I didn&#39;t know it had anything to do with the bard song.<br/>
Are you sure it&#39;s the song and not just people guessing it&#39;s the song<br/>
like the recent discussion about people blaming boat crashes on bard<br/>
songs? I thought it was more likely a bug with specialization, as that&#39;s<br/>
supposed to reduce casting cost by half and suddenly occasionally a<br/>
spell was costing double. Sounded like once and a while the code was<br/>
hitting something that caused a multiply by 2 instead of a divide by 2.<br/>
