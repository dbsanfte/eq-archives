<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575880328">You know you&#39;ve been playing too much EQ when hearing the word &quot;Erudite&quot; <br/>
makes you think of tall, black gentlemen or women with high foreheads, <br/>
instead of Isaac Asimov*.<br/>
<br/>
(For the confused, a definition:)<br/>
<br/>
Word of the Day for Monday February 18, 2002:<br/>
<br/>
erudite &#92;AIR-yuh-dyt; -uh-dyt&#92;, adjective:<br/>
Characterized by extensive reading or knowledge; learned.<br/>
<br/>
In front of imposing edifices like the Topkapi Palace or Hagia Sophia are <br/>
guides displaying Government-issued licenses. Many of these guides are <br/>
erudite historians who have quit low-paying jobs as university professors <br/>
and now offer private tours.<br/>
--&quot;What&#39;s Doing in Istanbul,&quot; New York Times, February 23, 1997<br/>
<br/>
The works of Baudrillard, Deleuze, Guattari and Virilio are filled with <br/>
seemingly erudite references to relativity, quantum mechanics, chaos <br/>
theory, etc.<br/>
--Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, Fashionable Nonsense<br/>
<br/>
Erudite comes from Latin eruditus, from e-, &quot;out of, from&quot; + rudis, &quot;rough, <br/>
untaught,&quot; which is also the source of English rude. Hence one who is <br/>
erudite has been brought out of a rough, untaught, rude state.<br/>

*Isaac Asimov loved limericks.  He once made a challenge that no one could <br/>
build a limerick using his name.  This was the winner:<br/>
That erudite Asimov, Isaac<br/>
Created a tremor quite seismic<br/>
When asked why he did so,<br/>
Replied he, these words low,<br/>
&quot;Baked beans for lunch: not a wise pick.&quot;<br/>
