&gt;<br/>
&gt;On crowd control, how do you get a group to let you do it?  Every time<br/>
&gt;I try charm, mez or selective fear someone (often more than one) freaks<br/>
&gt;out.  Last time I dared use charm (to pull a stoneleer off our<br/>
&gt;enchanter, help healer, add damage, list goes on) the monk in the party<br/>
&gt;took my head off for the audacity of not letting him tank 3 mobs at<br/>
&gt;once.  Is it just me falling into groups who refuse to try new things<br/>
&gt;or what?  I miss HK when people would be yelling at me if I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;charm/mez fast enough.  Tho, I&#39;ve noticed Pixie Strike having it&#39;s mez<br/>
&gt;portion resisted 7/10 times on any blue con mob or above, only slightly<br/>
&gt;better with instrument.  Is this a function of my cha (136) or do the<br/>
&gt;rumors I hear of it sucking soon after you get it ring true?  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;scary that Solon&#39;s is more reliable than Pixie.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i dunno, i think solon&#39;s is better than pixie cuz you get the damage that your<br/>
pet does.  it&#39;s always nice when you charm the ghoul arch magi or froglok tactician<br/>
and they blow up a dar or a bok.  i&#39;ve never had problems with pixie strike<br/>
and i&#39;m generally too lazy to use an instrument and my charisma is right around 112.<br/>
i was keeping lava beetles and ldc&#39;s in sol b mezzed with very little problems (was<br/>
saving mana for the efreeti break).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And on Lament, using it at all.  It worked nicely when I first got it<br/>
&gt;and I loved it for a long time but haven&#39;t used it since the early<br/>
&gt;twenties.  Every time I tried to use it I got a resist and the mob<br/>
&gt;(plus friends) aggroed on me and ground me into bardpaste.  Even with<br/>
&gt;lute it&#39;s dangerous at best.  I&#39;d like any advice you folks have on<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s proper uses.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lament works forever.  i&#39;ve used it in mistmoore to break the castle.  i&#39;ve used<br/>
it in the sentinel room in lower guk to break the 3 spawn.  i&#39;ve used it in unrest<br/>
in the torture room.  one tip is to stay as far back as you can when you lament.<br/>
it seems they are less likely to aggro on you if it fails.<br/>
