<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626188668"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I was thinking of we start out with 8 slots only.  Then each 4 lvl after lvl<br/>
&gt;20, we get 1 extra slot to mem our songs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t this is possible, as Verant would have to alter the interface template.<br/>
And then for only a single class to use it....<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the 8 is sufficient to have a good strategy going into an area...I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t recommend trying to keep your slots filled with all general purpose<br/>
songs.<br/>
