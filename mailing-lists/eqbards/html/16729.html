<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676961753">Actually I think the reason that is true, is because they could find no<br/>
other way to make the uber-mobs a challenge for caster except to give them<br/>
every anti-magic spell in the book, and then dream up a few more to give<br/>
them as well.  Still, I doubt casual gamers like myself will ever get beyond<br/>
35th level unless the game and my interest last for 3+ years which I think<br/>
unlikely.  Should we all be relegated to being casters then?  Should I<br/>
endure 35+ levels as second or third fiddle, just so I can be there when<br/>
some caster who&#39;s had it easy all his life comes whining for &#39;daddy&#39;?<br/>
Balance should never be level dependent.  The balance switch at ultra-high<br/>
levels is totally artificial anyhow.  If it wasn&#39;t for the &#39;special&#39; powers<br/>
given them, any group of 6 wizards of 49th level could simply walk up to<br/>
Cazic and Nuke him to oblivion.  He has what 10,000 hps?  10 Ice Comets<br/>
would do more than that.  Use 2 groups of wizards and it becomes even<br/>
sillier.  Unless you make these Uber-mobs nigh on immune to magic there<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be any strategy, you cannot give them enough hp&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Still my main point stands.  It does not fix the problem to tell me, &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
worry at very high levels you will be desperately needed.&quot;  I do not look<br/>
forward to the day when casters must beg me to join in so they can<br/>
accomplish something.  I&#39;d much rather we were all balanced all the time and<br/>
always needed each other, or at least had something significant to gain by<br/>
working together.  My group last nite in Sol A was the perfect example.  Me,<br/>
a shaman, a wizard, an enchanter, and a necromancer.  The only reason they<br/>
wanted me was because enchanter pets are too stupid to tank.  I was a<br/>
barrier plain and simple.  I wasn&#39;t really necessary, but having me meant<br/>
there was no way any of them were going to die.  If anyone went down it was<br/>
going to be me.<br/>

i know you have argued this for a long long time Kit, but i must say<br/>
something.  do you know how absolutely vital, critical, and in all ways a<br/>
MUST melee classes are at high levels?  nothing in the high level game can<br/>
be done without a lot of melee characters in your group or groups.  so what<br/>
is the definition of balance then?  ability to solo, or necessity to a<br/>
grooup, raid, or event?  melee classes are not only invaluable but a total<br/>
necessity at high levels, so could your argument follow at low to mid levels<br/>
and then reverse itself at high levels?  just an alternate scenario to<br/>
ponder and discuss.<br/>
