<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902992996">Last night I was in Mistmoore at 9PM Hawaii time.  Thats 3 AM EST.  When I<br/>
logged on, there were less than 15 people in the zone.  The entire time I was in<br/>
Mistmoore, my packet loss percentage never went below 25%.  A guildmate was also<br/>
in MM and I asked if they were having problems as well.  They stated they<br/>
weren&#39;t having any problems and suggested I quit the game completely and log<br/>
back in.  Tried that but it didn&#39;t do any good.  Decided to go ahead and play<br/>
despite the lag.  <br/>
<br/>
Got into a fight in the GY and packet loss zoomed up to over 50%.  Was fighting<br/>
a pledge familiar that started to run away.  Tried to cast chains on it but, due<br/>
to the lag, it ran down the cave and soon brought a train of ancilles back with<br/>
him.  I ended up dying and appeared at my bind spot in GFAY.  <br/>
<br/>
When I got to GFAY, I had absolutely no lag problems whatsoever.  Packet loss<br/>
was 0% and the lag number was very low.  LFAY was the same as well.  As soon as<br/>
I zoned back into MM, packet loss went back up to over 25%.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing since April and I have never had lag problems like I did last<br/>
night.  Any idea what was the cause? I know MM is considered a buggy zone but<br/>
there weren&#39;t that many people in MM and the other five people in my group were<br/>
having no problems whatsoever.  Don&#39;t think it was my connection (cable modem)<br/>
because I had no lag problems when I was in GFAY and LFAY.  <br/>
