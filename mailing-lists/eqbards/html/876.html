<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368536006">This is one of many complaints made by high level bards . . . saying that<br/>
they are not finding groups, and are not accepted at high levels.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon my audacity, but this complaint seems a little but premature, and to<br/>
us &quot;lower&quot; level people, seems kind of silly. I play EQ a LOT, and I&#39;m not<br/>
bad at it either. Since release my character has made it to Level 18. If<br/>
you are in the low 30&#39;s as you say, then you must play EQ obsessively, for<br/>
that level seems so far away to many of us we are not even thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
So relax and wait a bit for us normal people to catch up to you. Soon level<br/>
30 players will be just as common as level 20 players, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll<br/>
have more luck. It seems to me that you should be happy, not sad, about<br/>
your incredible sucess with the game. And to us down here in the mere<br/>
teens, the complaint seems amusing.<br/>
<br/>
I have never heard of groups where spots are &quot;reserved&quot; or &quot;permanent&quot; or<br/>
&quot;temporary&quot;. Again, I think this is something unique to high level<br/>
powergamers. It sounds amazingly rude to me. To be &quot;offered&quot; spots as if<br/>
they were job offers . . . wow, I feel for you, that ridiculous. It sounds<br/>
like high school all over again.<br/>
<br/>
My guild has 80 active members. The highest level is 30, and lowest level<br/>
(other than those who have started over with new characters) is about 8.<br/>
The mean is about 16 or 17. I think this represents the way things are as a<br/>
whole, so just wait for the wave to catch up with you . . . it will in due<br/>
time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Most of my former friends now hunt in GukBottom.  That dungeon is arranged<br/>
&gt;in 5-lvl areas... The first area is for 30-34 lvl chars, the next is for<br/>
&gt;35-39, etc..  My &quot;friends&quot; do not want to be &quot;bored&quot; by hunting &quot;mere blues&quot;<br/>
&gt;with me, when they could be hunting reds with their 35-39 or 40-44 lvl<br/>
&gt;friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Similarly, I have yet to be accepted into the Avatar hunting groups in<br/>
&gt;CazicThule.  Well, I was offered a temporary 1-hour spot last night, but I<br/>
&gt;was with a 33d lvl shaman and we wanted to be together.  Little did I know<br/>
&gt;until later that while I was offered a 1-hour slot, she was offered a<br/>
&gt;non-temporary spot.  She did not know of my offer.  We both turned down the<br/>
&gt;offers because we did not want to leave the other out. When I learned of the<br/>
&gt;dual offers, I may have lost one of the few over-35th lvl friends I have,<br/>
&gt;for I came slightly unglued over the slight that although we are equal lvl,<br/>
&gt;a mere bard is not good enough to warrant a full slot, only a temporary<br/>
&gt;while the group awaited someone else.  (Oddly enough, I have often asked for<br/>
&gt;spots to be saved for me since my former friends start playing an hour<br/>
&gt;before I get home from work... but they refuse to commit to the horrid idea<br/>
&gt;of saving a space.  More double standards.. =(   )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even my status as a &quot;mana bard&quot; does me little good.  I am about the 7th<br/>
&gt;highest bard on my server.  Unfortunately, there are only about 6 groups of<br/>
&gt;my level or higher people online at any one time.... Guess who gets left<br/>
&gt;out?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, I am quite unhappy in the game.  I have spent many hours helping<br/>
&gt;others, even unto my death, yet those I help do nothing for me in return.  I<br/>
&gt;see other bards being given plate breastpieces as reward for a single death<br/>
&gt;in melee, but I have not received a gift piece since lvl 25 when I received<br/>
&gt;a studded collar.  I see lvl 30 enchanters being taken into lvl 35-39<br/>
&gt;groups, but not 30-34 bards (no, I am not the only low-30s bard on MithMarr<br/>
&gt;with these problems).<br/>
