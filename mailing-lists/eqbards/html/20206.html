&gt; You need a magic weapon to fight wisps.  I think if you sing <br/>
&gt; COD and hymn<br/>
&gt; with lute equipped you can take one down.  You might have to <br/>
&gt; run and heal.<br/>
&gt; At level 12 throw in a bellow also and you should be OK.  I <br/>
&gt; had saved up for<br/>
&gt; a Dragoon Dirk by this time.<br/>

proc stun at 25 (seems WAY to high a start level to me but that is probably<br/>
why the price is so low)<br/>
