&gt; I saw a suggestion somewhere, for the new song.  Maybe it was here...anyway,<br/>
&gt; the suggestion was that a bard who&#39;s only using instruments and damage songs<br/>
&gt; probably doesn&#39;t really need to keep the mob targetted, and can therefore<br/>
&gt; keep the main tank targetted (assuming he&#39;s the only tank in the group) and<br/>
&gt; add this song in during the twist.  Shrug, just something different than<br/>
&gt; powerlevelling twinks.<br/>

Provocation.  So if the main tank is in your party and you&#39;re<br/>
singing Verses, Provocation will not stick.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, another problem with the song is that it doesn&#39;t give you<br/>
a message when it sticks.  The target does get a message<br/>
though.<br/>
