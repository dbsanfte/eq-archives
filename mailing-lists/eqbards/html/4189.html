<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459421112"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The way I see it, if the primary character gives an item or two to his<br/>
&gt;secondary character (without camping explicitly to give it to the second<br/>
&gt;character) this would have no effect on &quot;the line&quot; what so ever.  YThe<br/>
&gt;line&#39;s length, as well as your position in it, remain unchanged.  If<br/>
&gt;anything it eliminates an otherwise competitive entity from the line.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with you here.  With my bard, I picked up a RTS<br/>
and a Snakeskin Jerkin in Paw.  I didn&#39;t sell them, as the market<br/>
is dropping out on RTS&#39;s.  Instead I made it a quest for my (then)<br/>
lvl 6 shaman to come to Freeport to pick them up.  I figured they<br/>
served as an appropriate reward for completing a journey like that<br/>
at that level.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly didn&#39;t camp for the items just to give them to my shaman.<br/>
