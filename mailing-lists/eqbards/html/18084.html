<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-883997410">i think we&#39;ve only gotten enchanter, cleric, and shaman spells from sky so<br/>
far.  the portals for druids and wizards are available for purchase at the<br/>
gypsy camp in north karana, and you can scribe them (level 34) now.  no idea<br/>
on bard songs, anyone else hope we can just buy them as always? =)  i heard<br/>
some spells/songs you can buy, some throught quests/research, some through<br/>
random drop, or maybe more than one of the above.<br/>
<br/>
what is the new last name?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I dunno if they are in (maybe random drops in Sky like some <br/>
&gt; of the caster <br/>
&gt; spells? *shrug*), but I would like to know if anyone has <br/>
&gt; found any of them. <br/>
&gt; Like many of you I will most likely be hitting 51 shortly <br/>
&gt; after logging in <br/>
&gt; on Monday, and I WANT Song 51 ASAP! =) If the song truly is a <br/>
&gt; 75% speed <br/>
&gt; increase + levitate + invis + see invis, well as far as <br/>
&gt; Kunark and it&#39;s huge <br/>
&gt; zones are concerned, it will be the best thing since <br/>
&gt; Wonderbread. If anyone <br/>
&gt; gets info on where and how to obtain our new songs please <br/>
&gt; post here as soon <br/>
&gt; as possible. </span></blockquote></div>
