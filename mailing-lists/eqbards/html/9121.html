&gt; This is very common. The first thing I tell newbies in EQ to do is to move that &quot;a&quot; binding<br/>
&gt; somewhere else (I use ~).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was a real common key that a lot of people I knew used and<br/>
recommended to others (especially those who rebound movement keys to the<br/>
wasd block). Worked fine in beta and even in release, until Verant<br/>
decided to put the transparent toggle on ~. Man did that drive me crazy.<br/>
I kept attack there for a week or two, suffering through the constant<br/>
toggling of transparent mode until I finally broke down and moved it.<br/>
Then, just as I started to get used to the new key, they released a<br/>
patch that allowed you to rebind the transparent toggle. GRRR!!!!.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why their interface developer has to be /feedbacked<br/>
to make every new key he adds configurable. How much extra work can it<br/>
be?<br/>
