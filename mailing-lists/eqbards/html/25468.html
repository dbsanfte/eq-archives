<br/>
cracked me up pretty good, that my friend, is batting 1.000<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the article for you people that can&#39;t surf from work...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The UK version of Edge magazine has a look inside Sony Online Enterainment,<br/>
as well as some words from their CEO, Kelly Flock, and boy did he have a few<br/>
things to say.<br/>
<br/>
The article, the first few paragraphs of which can be found here, is a<br/>
pretty standard look at a company growing by leaps and bounds in the online<br/>
entertainment industry. Then we get to this (only available in the print<br/>
version of the article): <br/>
<br/>
When asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is dismissive,<br/>
relying instead on the expertise of his staff. &quot;No, we never talk to<br/>
consumers - they just fuck us up. Someone asked for a copy of our market<br/>
research which made us take the decision to do EverQuest. I said we hadn&#39;t<br/>
done any market research. Had we done, the game would never have been made.<br/>
We never focus on them. Gamers don&#39;t know what they want. We just want to<br/>
know if they have a valid credit card.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Well, hell. This explains a lot, doesn&#39;t it? No wonder customer service has<br/>
sucked harder than a Vegas prostitute with an Electrolux attachment; the CEO<br/>
of the bloody place thinks that we the customers will only fuck them up. <br/>
<br/>
Er... Smed? Smed? You wanna try and explain this to us in a way that us<br/>
silly shits can understand? <br/>
<br/>

Subject: RE: [eqbards] Bard Stacking?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - Verant is continuing to bat 1.000 on their changes to bard code -<br/>
and can&#39;t implement it without introducing a major bug.  I&#39;m not sure all<br/>
the ins and outs of the bug - but the worst of it was the Epic proc not<br/>
working at all basically.<br/>
