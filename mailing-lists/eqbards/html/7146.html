<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588943713">I have seen this exact behavior in other zones as well, namely Misty Thicket, Blackburrow and Upper Guk. Merely running past an ongoing melee that I am not involved in seems to then later adjust my faction when the melee concludes. As you stated, so far I have not disliked the behavior because the faction adjustments are in my favor, but it definitely seems to be a bug.<br/>

Back from lurker mode because a silent bard is as useless as lipstick on a troll.<br/>

&gt; This doesn&#39;t explain situations I&#39;ve seen where another group is<br/>
&gt; fighting a mob (not one of the ones they are ignoring) and it stops part<br/>
&gt; way through the fight to run over and take a whack at the bard in<br/>
&gt; another group. I&#39;ve seen this in both Unrest and Cazic.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s still something buggy going on as well.  I&#39;m still<br/>
taking faction hits in Solusek for mobs that other people pull<br/>
past my group (which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing since I<br/>
want to increase my faction with the fire giants and Solusek<br/>
mining company).<br/>
