&gt; Before we submit a petition, I think we should also consider the possibility<br/>
&gt; that this is not even a bug.  I say that because it is within the realms of<br/>
&gt; possibility that Verant intended for our songs to work this way.  Sound does<br/>
&gt; carry so its possible that even though we can&#39;t see the monsters, they can<br/>
&gt; certainly hear our songs through the walls.  Something to consider. <br/>

with bellow and chains? As they are sound, line of sight should be<br/>
irrelevant, no? Anyway, I would say this is a bug, or more likely a<br/>
design flaw. The recent discussion on the charismatic carillon shows<br/>
that there are other problems with the z axis that they haven&#39;t fixed<br/>
either.<br/>
