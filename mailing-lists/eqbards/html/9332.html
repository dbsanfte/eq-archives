I wrote this PRECISE same message at your level - complete with saying I&#39;d<br/>
all but given up on teaching people to work with this song correctly.  Now<br/>
at level 28 I find that almost every competent group that I join (maybe 7<br/>
out of 10 of them) works this way without being instructed to, and better<br/>
yet, most are now familiar with spells like Lullaby or the Enchanter&#39;s AE<br/>
Mesmerization.  Yes, there are still groups that don&#39;t understand Lullaby at<br/>
my level, but they&#39;re typically much more open to listening to and following<br/>
my suggestions.  My frustration at your level was the same - I&#39;d instruct a<br/>
group and they&#39;d either ask me who made me God or ignore me altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are second only to Enchanters for crowd control.  Even your beefy<br/>
Troll and Ogre buddies are going to watch their life drain away with a bunch<br/>
of blue and green mobs smacking on them.  A few startlingly fast deaths in<br/>
Permafrost, Runnyeye or Guk and your friends will be all ears when you say<br/>
you can do crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t give up.  Keep explaining it to your groups so that they&#39;ll know how<br/>
things work 10 levels from now.  It will pay off in a few levels when the<br/>
tanks realize that their massive HPs only go so far, and the casters realize<br/>
how frighteningly fragile they are when the blue bar is heading South.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve almost given up on trying to perfect this (Lullaby) with<br/>
&gt; pickup groups<br/>
&gt; at my level (16-19). Either nobody understands /assist, they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t trust my<br/>
&gt; lullaby to work, or they just plain don&#39;t listen. After one<br/>
&gt; nightmarish pull<br/>
&gt; (&quot;A Orc Warrior&quot;s and Priests along the west side of Oasis) in<br/>
&gt; which I died<br/>
&gt; because nobody would let my mobs sleep, I pulled out the virtual<br/>
&gt; chalkboard<br/>
&gt; and went though it step-by-step:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) I type MEZ<br/>
&gt; 2) Everyone /assist the puller<br/>
&gt; 3) Stay on one target until it is dead.<br/>
&gt; 4) Healer watch my health as all the other baddies pound on me<br/>
&gt; between naps<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone said OK. The very next nasty pull I typed MEZ and watched as<br/>
&gt; everybody chose their favorite Orc and nobody assisted the puller. It was<br/>
&gt; late so I said my goodbyes and shuffled home. I think it will take a<br/>
&gt; situation where this song noticeably saves lives before people will be<br/>
&gt; convinced. Next time I try it I&#39;m going to make sure to Selo out<br/>
&gt; of there if<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see a lot of /assisting going on. It only hurts the bard to stay<br/>
&gt; cause the mobs aren&#39;t going to leave him alone when they&#39;re awake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The evening was fun and the xp was good, but I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>
&gt; graduating to more mature groups where satisfaction comes from watching a<br/>
&gt; good plan come together, rather than marvelling that we didn&#39;t die when we<br/>
&gt; deserved to.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. Who decided that non-SoW&#39;d trolls make good pullers? The ten minutes<br/>
&gt; ours was away selling I pulled and we killed twice as many mobs<br/>
&gt; with little<br/>
&gt; downtime.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This simple tactic seems to be the hardest think for hybrid tanks to<br/>
&gt; learn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have seen even mid 30&#39;s (typically in HK where it is after all &quot;safe&quot;<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t have to be really skilled to survive) not follow this really<br/>
&gt; &gt; simple yet effective proceedure.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It works!  It really, really works!<br/>
