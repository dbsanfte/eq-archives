<div id="ygrps-yiv-858415572">I thought we settled this issue...<br/>
<br/>
bring extra flutes<br/>
bag everything and fill as many main slots with extra flutes as you can<br/>
zone into Ogg  <br/>
get binded there<br/>
duel your friend and get killed<br/>
loot every thing except the flutes<br/>
<br/>
Now you have a storage corpse - complete with a night&#39;s supply of flutes. Do<br/>
this a few times and you will see that the storage corpse and flute thing is<br/>
more of a bother than a help and soon you will either selos or sneak by any<br/>
bouncers that are not camped.<br/>

		I find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the<br/>
Sol&#39;s I have to<br/>
		run all the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to<br/>
my corpse,</div>
