<div id="ygrps-yiv-139215310">I&#39;d have to agree with John all the way here.  He&#39;s right on when he says<br/>
that we are &quot;not a&#39;s&quot; when it comes to enhancements, and &quot;all of&#39;s&quot; when it<br/>
comes to nerfs.  When the rogue skills get implemented in the expansion, be<br/>
prepared to be a &quot;not a&quot; again as they implement locks that are hard enough<br/>
to pick to be challenging to 35+ level rogues, and impossible for bards.<br/>
Are we a hybrid?  Yes, but probably one that natural selection would have<br/>
killed off by now if we were not all so stubborn.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah and I can see our &#39;bind&#39; song now.  It cannot be cast indoors, and<br/>
it has a duration of 18 seconds.<br/>
