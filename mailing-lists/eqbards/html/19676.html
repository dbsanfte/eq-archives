<div id="ygrps-yiv-880472755">Here is a tip from someone on this list from long time ago -<br/>
<br/>
When you move items, look at the tip of your mouse pointer NOT at the item<br/>
(its lagged a bit behind the tip of the arrorw.)  Put the tip of the arrow<br/>
into the center of the box and the item wil ldrop right in.  If you look at<br/>
the item and put it over a box, the pointer can easily be in the cracks or<br/>
outside the box and oppsie, your item drops - and sometimes (poofs).<br/>
<br/>
Rangers seem to get the blues right about where you are.  Guk and Solb -<br/>
sigh.  Dogs and frogs - lots and lots.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Reedwind -- Welcome!!!!<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
<br/>

&gt; This I&#39;m not so good at I&#39;m afraid. I need some practice I imagine. My<br/>
&gt; problem, and I&#39;m sure this doesn&#39;t come as any surprise, is dropping my<br/>
&gt; instruments.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can only dream of getting a character to 50 now, 11 levels to go with my<br/>
&gt; ranger but he&#39;s running into hard times. </span></blockquote></div>
