&gt; I gotta agree with and disagree with you!  Your advice on where to go for<br/>
&gt; him is good.  His problem seems to be finding friends to play with.  Stay<br/>
&gt; out of Sol-A - yes - especially if you do not have a good group.  Even if<br/>
&gt; you do - lo to mid 20&#39;s can be bad if you go to the wrong places.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know where the easy places are.  When my group went (former group I shud say<br/>
&gt; - they are all hi 40&#39;s now and &lt;snif sniff&gt; I am stuck in 36 =( ), we tried<br/>
&gt; the bar room at 28ish and got spanked badly (cleric, bard, de sk,<br/>
&gt; necro/enchanter, troll war, ranger).  Later, when we were lo 30&#39;s and had<br/>
&gt; more experience in knowing what to clear first etc. we could take and hold<br/>
&gt; these rooms fine and get good xp and good loots. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This raises a good point as well, and that&#39;s learning where the &quot;safe&quot;<br/>
spots are to work when you are exploring a dungeon. The bar room, IMO,<br/>
is a classic example of a bad place to pull to or try to set up a base<br/>
in an uncamped dungeon. It has 3 different ways in in an area where<br/>
there are lots of wandering mobs with a large agro radius. Talk about a<br/>
disaster waiting to happen. We found at the relatively low level we went<br/>
there that the stair well up and around the corner from the bar room was<br/>
a way better place to set up our base while we cleared that area. A good<br/>
puller needs to learn to recognise those spots where wandering mob<br/>
activity is light and the chance of an unexpected respawn won&#39;t tip a<br/>
fight into disaster.<br/>

&gt; So, SOL-A seems good to me - hard yes, but once you hit the &#39;prime&#39; level<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s good. I see these low to mid 20&#39;s running in and out and wonder where<br/>
&gt; they are going - I guess I need to explore it more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mid 20&#39;s would do ok to the left after you get past the trap<br/>
room. Down that way is the kobold predator and the foreman, and neither<br/>
of them or the mobs around are particularly hard or hard to get to. By<br/>
the late 20&#39;s, if you have a druid in your group, you can start to work<br/>
a little deeper as you now have an evac&#39;r if things really hit the fan.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dungeons you do in groups and try to be at the prime level - too young and<br/>
&gt; you get spanked; too old and there is no xp and maybe still get spanked by<br/>
&gt; trains of greenies.  Solo, well you need to be pretty powerfull so that<br/>
&gt; rules bards out unless you are really way above the mobs and still trains of<br/>
&gt; greenies can kill you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good advice. If you have a good group though, and want a challenge and<br/>
an experience that only the fastest levellers ever had when they first<br/>
explored places like lower guk, the under used dungeons like perma and<br/>
sol b can still provide it, while lower guk has become so overcamped<br/>
that you&#39;ll never be able to explore it that way on a mature server.<br/>
Just try to avoid printing out and using the maps on the spoiler sites<br/>
if you want to play that way, as that can take the fun of exploring away<br/>
completely.<br/>
