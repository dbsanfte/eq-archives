<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087027315">Even if the boots summoned 20 water at once like the level 24 mage spell,<br/>
I&#39;d find them more useful.  Mind you, they&#39;d still stay in my backpack and<br/>
only come out when I&#39;m thirsty.<br/>
I just cant be bothered to click on the damn things 20 times to get a usable<br/>
amount of water.  I don&#39;t know any caster that bothers to use their single<br/>
food/drink summoning spells, its just too much trouble.  Its not exactly<br/>
hard or expensive to buy a large supply of food/drink and carry it with you.<br/>

Everyone keeps complaining about the effects on our new armor, myself<br/>
included.  (Don&#39;t get me wrong I LOVE enduring breath on the gloves!!!!<br/>
Anyone who doesn&#39;t is silly)<br/>
<br/>
But nobody has suggested alternatives.  I would love to see ideas on things<br/>
we could get (be realistic) that we can&#39;t already do with songs that we use<br/>
relatively regularly.<br/>
