Misty wanders from zone to zone. I have seen her in both West Karana<br/>
and Qeynos Hills. (Shes one of those &#39;shuffling (ie walking) mobs).<br/>
<br/>
Try song #14, the &#39;worthless&#39; identify song on the bracer next time..<br/>
I bet you too will have this great ability to spot good equipment from<br/>
bad =)<br/>

Uldar doth spoke :<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Funny, everyone remembers her from WK, but I know I was in Qhills, right<br/>
&gt;around the tower on the way TO WK. I know because i looked in the tower<br/>
&gt;looking for this guard she disliked so much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW, if you happen upon a Guard&#39;s body and happen to loot a no-drop<br/>
&gt;&quot;guard bracer&quot; and think &quot;maybe this is the one the Captain in NK guard<br/>
&gt;tower is looking for&quot; and you decide to give it to him, If you are wrong<br/>
&gt;and it is from a good guard, you better be ready to take the jump off<br/>
&gt;the tower, because is appears he can tell the difference... not that I<br/>
&gt;would know (rubbing his backside from the fall).<br/>

&gt;P.S. I thought 30 was bad, then I got to 35...<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; &gt; she is talking about Guard McCluskey right?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Yes.  Misty Storyswapper is her name, and she is in West Karana. </span></blockquote></div>
