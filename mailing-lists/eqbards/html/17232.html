<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895871705"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is incorrect.  Warriors make a crippling blow at any <br/>
&gt; health.  You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; thinking of their ATK stat going through the roof (Berzerk) <br/>
&gt; whenever they go<br/>
&gt; below 30% of their health.  Thus they hit more often when <br/>
&gt; hurt badly.  But<br/>
&gt; the crippling blow is just another kind of crit.  And <br/>
&gt; Warriors crit a LOT<br/>
&gt; more regularly than any proc&#39;ing weapon I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>are you sure?  i believe warriors get critical hits at any time, but can<br/>
only get crippling blows when in a beserker frenzy, whatever level of health<br/>
that is (under 25%?).  at least i have never seen a crippling blow any other<br/>
time, and one day doing seafuries we had fun with our cleric keeping a tank<br/>
just under the beserker frenzy threshhold to make him land a bunch of<br/>
crippling blows.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Incorrect.  At level 34 a Ranger can kick for up to 23 points.  Kick<br/>
&gt; recycles about every 10 seconds.  So no, this is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our bellow at level 34 is 18dmg.  how often can we do it, every 6 seconds?<br/>
(god i feel stupid i don&#39;t know this but i haven&#39;t bellowed other than for<br/>
pulling for 9 months).  anyway let&#39;s say 6 seconds, so in a minute we can do<br/>
180dmg, and in a minute a ranger can do 138dmg with kick.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Agreed, you&#39;re looking for numbers.  But I think we can all <br/>
&gt; pretty much<br/>
&gt; agree that we do 50% of the dmg of a normal hybrid in Melee <br/>
&gt; without having<br/>
&gt; to crunch numbers.  I mean, why crunch numbers when that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; already pretty<br/>
&gt; obvious?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yep i agree with the we do 50% of hybrid and 25% of pure melee damage<br/>
figures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now, as to this comparison of Melee dmg.  Why are we <br/>
&gt; comparing our 2nd rate<br/>
&gt; dmg method to other hybrid&#39;s 1st rate dmg method?  Our #1 <br/>
&gt; damage producer is<br/>
&gt; our songs.  Our songs vastly outdamage any hybrid&#39;s damage <br/>
&gt; curve when used<br/>
&gt; correctly.  If I twist CoC, DDD, CoD, NiV with my 50 bard on Test I do<br/>
&gt; damage very comparable to what a ranger or paladin or <br/>
&gt; shadowknight of equal<br/>
&gt; level can do.  Add to that my ability to regen mana for <br/>
&gt; others, heal others,<br/>
&gt; speed others combat up etc.  I&#39;d say that Bards are not <br/>
&gt; nearly as bad off as<br/>
&gt; many seem to paint us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a combo of songs is very powerful, but wouldn&#39;t you say the big downside is<br/>
that being AE we have to attack multiple targets with them (and thus get<br/>
pounded on by multiple mobs), and they have a very high resist rate against<br/>
similarly levelled mobs (especially at 50).  whereas meleeing has the plus<br/>
of not being resisted (in a sense, no you don&#39;t always hit and don&#39;t always<br/>
hit for max) and being on a single target.  i&#39;d love some single target<br/>
damage songs, and i heard our chant songs were recently really fixed, so i<br/>
may break those out and give them a try.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Bottom line:  Bards are not a melee class in the classic <br/>
&gt; sense.  Yes, we can<br/>
&gt; (and should) get in there and mix it up.  But no, we aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; meant to be up<br/>
&gt; there swinging swords all the time.  90% of the time our <br/>
&gt; songs are our best<br/>
&gt; weapons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nod.  nice thread, and i like hearing your point of view as you&#39;ve been in<br/>
the game for so long, even if we all don&#39;t agree all the time.<br/>
