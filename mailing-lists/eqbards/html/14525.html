&gt; tried nagafen since patch?  his breath is now outrageously <br/>
&gt; powerful, or FR<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t do crap anymore.  vox is still the same though.  but <br/>
&gt; with the same<br/>
&gt; crew we routinely take down nag with, we got spanked twice <br/>
&gt; (24 ppl).  it was<br/>
&gt; late and people had to leave, so next day a different group <br/>
&gt; of 48+ took him<br/>
&gt; down.  i think we could do it with 30, but he is definitely <br/>
&gt; upgraded or FR<br/>
&gt; is bugged.<br/>
