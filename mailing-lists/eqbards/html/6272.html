<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164315099">no prob, i know its not a flame, i like the discussion.  but as far as my<br/>
character, i don&#39;t have all the spiffy items yet, and i still have fun with<br/>
her and don&#39;t see the point of retirement.  in fact, my point is that adding<br/>
new zones for level 50 characters benefits everyone else.  like i said, when<br/>
fear was open we were out of your hair.  and these aren&#39;t essentially new<br/>
zones, they have always been there and intended on opening but they haven&#39;t<br/>
gotten to it yet.  opening these zones has always been in verant&#39;s plan for<br/>
the game.  so with these zones to be opening soon and the expansion, i do<br/>
think it is in verant&#39;s plans to have these characters around for a long<br/>
time.  hurry up and kabong me Talies before it&#39;s too late! =P<br/>

&gt; Heh, don&#39;t misconstrue my email as a flame.  I certainly have nothing<br/>
&gt; personal against you or any other 50th level character.  I&#39;m simply<br/>
&gt; debating the philosophy behind playing a level 50 character, <br/>
&gt; and whether<br/>
&gt; Verant really ever intended people to play maxxed out <br/>
&gt; characters for very<br/>
&gt; long.  I merely assert that it may be time for Shada (not <br/>
&gt; you, but Shada)<br/>
&gt; to go into the hallowed halls of the legendary bards that <br/>
&gt; achieved that<br/>
&gt; pinnacle of power.  If you&#39;ve gotten all the spiffy items, <br/>
&gt; and done all the<br/>
&gt; spiffy quests in the game, what&#39;s the point?  Roleplaying?  <br/>
&gt; Sure, but that<br/>
&gt; can be done with ANY level character.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, it would be great if they raised the level cap and came up with a<br/>
&gt; bunch more zones for &gt;= 50th level characters, but not at the <br/>
&gt; expense of<br/>
&gt; all the people that aren&#39;t that high.  We ALL knew there was <br/>
&gt; a level 50 cap<br/>
&gt; when we started this game, so we can&#39;t use the &quot;we&#39;re paying for this<br/>
&gt; service&quot; argument.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In any case, this isn&#39;t particularly bard specific.  So I&#39;ll leave the<br/>
&gt; discussion at that.<br/>
