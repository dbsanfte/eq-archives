&gt; <br/>
&gt; I play a human bard because I heard that a non-human race gets more of an<br/>
&gt; experience penalty then a human bard (i.e. It would take more experience to<br/>
&gt; get a wood-elf bard to level then a human one).  My question is: Is this<br/>
&gt; true?  And if so, how much more experience are we talking about?  Is it<br/>
&gt; worth the night vision and foraging to play wood-elf bard with the increased<br/>
&gt; experience needed to level?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I play a half-elf bard but I&#39;ve found that this kind of question is<br/>
more a case of personal preference.  After all, do you want to level<br/>
faster but in return have to carry a lightsource around at all times like<br/>
a human does?  Or do you want to be able to wear small and medium armors<br/>
like a wood elf can?  Or would you want to be accepted (not necessarily<br/>
liked) in elven and human lands like a half-elf can?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all personal preference based on what your goals are for your<br/>
character, or at least that&#39;s my view.<br/>
