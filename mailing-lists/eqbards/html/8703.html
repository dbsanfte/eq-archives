I also remember spotting a certain naked wood elf bard dragging her<br/>
corpse to the courtyard, firing up invisibility and getting her stuff<br/>
back ;-)  That wouldn&#39;t have been you by any chance  hehe<br/>

&gt;hmm i ran into Dreammer.  3 of us were in the tower, and i saw the Catiff on<br/>
&gt;track so we went to check him out.  just sitting there no one around so we<br/>
&gt;killed him hehe.  immediately Dreammer starts shouting to the zone how the<br/>
&gt;high level group stole their kill and we don&#39;t need the loot or experience<br/>
&gt;from him and blah blah blah.  and this was AFTER we gave them the loot<br/>
&gt;sheesh.  he did apologize though, and asked US not to bring any trains LOL.<br/>
&gt;i didn&#39;t know HE was the famous trainmaster.<br/>
