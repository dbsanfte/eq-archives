 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t quite agree.  Bards tend to be most aware of what<br/>
needs to be done (because they usually die first if the group<br/>
screws up :), but they also tend to be pretty bad at<br/>
situational awareness and communicating.  Pounding those song<br/>
keys and trying to spot a dark-blue song message scrolling by<br/>
takes its toll.  i.e. bards are good at overall strategy (we<br/>
need to take out this mob first, then that mob, so person X<br/>
should do this, person Y should do that, etc), but bad at<br/>
on-the-spot tactics (this thing just got several lucky hits<br/>
in, we&#39;ll have to take a chance and person X has to do this<br/>
and person Y has to do that or we&#39;re done for).<br/>
<br/>
Just about anybody with sufficient intelligence, SA, and<br/>
communication skill (especially fast typing :) can be a good<br/>
group leader.  Bards just tend to have more at stake and thus<br/>
are forced to learn stuff at an early age that a good leader<br/>
should know.<br/>
