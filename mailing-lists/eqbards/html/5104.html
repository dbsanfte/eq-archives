<div id="ygrps-yiv-803183457">My guess is that your were still grouped and thus unable to damage him.´┐¢<br/>
Disband your group and try again.´┐¢ I have been meaning to do this my self<br/>
and would be very interested in hearing your results.´┐¢ Please post what your<br/>
find and include your stats during the duel (level, str, ac, atk, etc.) and<br/>
what songs did what dmg. Both with and without instruments.<br/>

<br/>
Ok I wanted to see what my AoE song&#39;s damages were tonite so I dueled a<br/>
friend of mine.´┐¢ I had seen other people document what their&#39;s did so I was<br/>
going to see for myself.´┐¢ Well we did the typical /duel to each other and my<br/>
songs had no effect.´┐¢ No messages or anything.´┐¢ They just made the pretty<br/>
lights when I first started them and then nothing.´┐¢ I did a bellow and he<br/>
took damage.´┐¢ What am I missing?´┐¢ He is a level 28 by the way, but I dont<br/>
see what the level difference would have to do with it, besides him kicking<br/>
my butt.´┐¢ 8)<br/>
