<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026182298">Someone was selling a Lotgp last night, sent him a tell saying how much?<br/>
He replied, &quot;900pp&quot;. I was like WTF, you realise it doesn&#39;t actually do<br/>
anything more than a normal Lute. He said yeah I know but I paid 1000pp for<br/>
it.<br/>
Shortly after that I see him doing an /auction Trading Full Suit of Lambent<br/>
<br/>
Guess he was a powergaming d00d that couldn&#39;t hack being a weedy bard.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have heard rumors that this Lute doesn&#39;t do anything good, can anyone<br/>
&gt; confirm this for me? Might make me feel a little better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  There is one thing that I think the lute is good for.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic punches a snake for 13 points of damage.<br/>
  Harmonic punches a willowisp for 12 points of damage.<br/>
  Harmonic punches King Thex&#39;Ka IV for 9 points of damage.<br/>
<br/>
  There you have it.  That&#39;s the most use you&#39;ll receive from that pos.<br/>
<br/>
  Ask them to take you to Mistmoore and get a more commonly dropped<br/>
  &#39;Gypsy Lute&#39;(sm).  It&#39;s no-drop and gives +5 to magic, no healing<br/>
  bonuses tho.  But at least it&#39;s something.<br/>
