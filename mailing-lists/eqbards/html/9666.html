&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Problem with Anthem de Arms?<br/>
&gt;Date: Sat, 6 Nov 1999 22:36:41 -0600<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a level 12 bard.  Picked up a slightly used Ashenwood Spear today (no<br/>
&gt;haste left), but when I&#39;m singing the Anthem de Arms, someone in my group<br/>
&gt;whose weapons have a slower delay than mine are attacking much faster than <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;am.  (I&#39;m del 22, she had a del 28 weapon).  It was almost as if she had<br/>
&gt;haste cast on her or something, and I wasn&#39;t getting any effect at all from<br/>
&gt;the song.  This went on for a couple hours, so I know she didn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;another spell on her. :)  When I solo, my del decreases normally.  Maybe I<br/>
&gt;AM attacking faster, but I still can&#39;t figure out WHY someone with a slower<br/>
&gt;weapon than me would be attacking A LOT faster than I am.  It appeared as<br/>
&gt;though her del had dropped down to at least 15, if not lower!  I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;mind,<br/>
&gt;we chewed through mobs really fast :) it just strikes me as odd.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(oh, and I WISH there was a way to recharge items like the spear. :))<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well it&#39;s POSSIBLE she has a flowing black silk sash.. ?(haste item)  I know <br/>
more than a few twinks sporting one of those.<br/>
