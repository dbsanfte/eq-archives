<div id="ygrps-yiv-884299238">Try the orc camp in west commons, along the northern mountain wall,<br/>
just NW of the lake.  There are 3 separate camps there, in terms of<br/>
linked orcs... 1 with 1 orc, another with 2, and a 3rd with 3.  I was<br/>
soloing there for half of 12th level while trying to get enough belts<br/>
to get my squad ring in Rivervale (which I just got this morning<br/>
finally).  I found that switching between the 1-orc and 2-orc camp<br/>
worked great, and I could hold my own even if I failed to lull one of<br/>
the orcs in the 2-orc camp and both came after me.<br/>

&gt; Hello I am at lvl 12 Wood elf bard.  it seems that I cannot find a<br/>
&gt; good<br/>
&gt; place for me to solo.  I went to CB but the orc&#39;s hit so hard that<br/>
&gt; it keeps<br/>
&gt; disrupting my song.  I died 5 times in there.  I went to Nro and<br/>
&gt; all the<br/>
&gt; places has been camp out.  I was wondering if anyone know a good<br/>
&gt; place to<br/>
&gt; solo at lvl 12.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanx,<br/>
&gt; Your Friendly Rogue and Bard,<br/>
