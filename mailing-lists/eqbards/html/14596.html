Seriously,  do what I do when you see posts that disturb you: delete them.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, you have a lot of monsters to fight that are close to your level.<br/>
Deal with them now.  Play the game &#39;one level at a time&#39; and enjoy.  There<br/>
is nothing to be gained by worrying about stuff that is far away and<br/>
unknown.  The dragon&#39;s you fight will be different from the ones that we<br/>
fight today just as they are different from the first ones that were fought<br/>
on all of the servers.  By the time you get there, there will be new<br/>
weapons, new spells and a history of tips, tricks, and tales from those who<br/>
have gone before.<br/>
<br/>
Verant _knows_ that they are in the entertainment business.  My take is that<br/>
they _will_ keep &quot;raising the bar&quot; on certain zones/monsters to prevent them<br/>
from being &quot;farmed&quot; and provide challenge to the high levels.  Sometimes<br/>
they may &quot;road block&quot; a zone or mob for one reason or another.  Sometimes<br/>
they will make mistakes.  But any time there is a change in the status quo -<br/>
you will hear complaints.<br/>

&gt; some of what you said was my point, Naggy is upgraded, Vox is upgraded,<br/>
&gt; Innoruk (he&#39;s the one with DT, right?) is upgraded.  They did this<br/>
&gt; because they were dying too easily.  This is all fine and good for<br/>
&gt; people who have been there before, and have plane/dragon equipment and<br/>
&gt; plane/dragon experience. (Actually its not, but at least you had a shot<br/>
&gt; at it)  By the time we get there, there will be no chance.  We will not<br/>
&gt; be lvl 50 before expansion, I cant imagine what Verant is going to do to<br/>
&gt; all those guys then... </span></blockquote></div>
