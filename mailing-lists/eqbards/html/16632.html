<b>Subject:</b> Keeping mob in agro range <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-720952789">I use bellow to keep mobs stuck to me that I don&#39;t want drilling me in<br/>
the back (like stuff with BS).<br/>
<br/>
I use bellow (not sure if there is a better song to pull with at higher<br/>
lvls) to pull them, fire up Selo&#39;s (it shoudl still be active from when<br/>
you were looking for them)<br/>
<br/>
Start the run back, after Selo&#39;s pulses, try to bellow on the still<br/>
targeted mob.  If he is not in range, stop, and keep mashing the bellow<br/>
button.  As soon as he is in bellow range I take off again, repulse<br/>
Selo&#39;s and repeat as necesaary.   I found this to be the safest way to<br/>
pull backstabbers...<br/>
