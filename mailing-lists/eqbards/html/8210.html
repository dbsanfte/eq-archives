<div id="ygrps-yiv-627423551">Bizarre if that is indeed the case it totally invalidates what Brad said at<br/>
GenCon which was that the easy farming of wisps by level 12-15 melee types<br/>
was the overlying reason they took out magic glove hitting code for all but<br/>
monks.  The low cost of other magic weapons like the dirk disaster was what<br/>
caused wisps to be nerfed even further in their loot with no save<br/>
lightstones.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;At 10th level wisps are still red even the monk will lose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Qeynos Hills / West Karana just the other day my second toon<br/>
(level 9) con&#39;d one yellow.  Wisps there are avg level 10-12.<br/>

&gt;could punch normal critters for around the same damage 7-8 points.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 10-15, your dmg multiplier doesnt allow you to hit<br/>
for that much.  On dmg 2 fists, the most you are gonna do<br/>
is 3 or 4 dmg.  That&#39;s not enough dmg, when the wisps can hit<br/>
for up to 20.  Max H2H I&#39;ve seen at level 38 is 8 dmg, nothing<br/>
higher.<br/>
<br/>
Monks however at level 10-15, are punching for about 12-15<br/>
per hit and dual punch.  With magic gloves a monk can defeat<br/>
a white con wisp, I&#39;ve done it myself with my monk.<br/>
