<div id="ygrps-yiv-823129175">ah ok, can you tell i have done lots of quests? =) my assumption though was<br/>
based on the fact that it was not in brackets for one, while every other<br/>
item he gives is in brackets, and the fact that he says ask him about it<br/>
later, not now.  but good point, i didn&#39;t realize that.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just because its no in brackets doesnt mean it itsnt a <br/>
&gt; trigger. Cant remember <br/>
&gt; the specific quest at the moment but you got more information <br/>
&gt; for it by <br/>
&gt; asking about something that wasnt in brackets. </span></blockquote></div>
