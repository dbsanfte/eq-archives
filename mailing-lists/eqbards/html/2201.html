 </span></blockquote>Nope.  A mob that&#39;s aggressive to you will see you through<br/>
invisibility (although if you run far enough away from many<br/>
mobs, they will give up chasing you although their aggressive<br/>
radius to you remains enlarged).  In fact, if you are playing<br/>
the invisibility song and any member of your party is<br/>
attacked, you will immediately be attacked because (1) you&#39;re<br/>
a bard, and (2) you cast a beneficial &quot;spell&quot; on someone who<br/>
was just attacked so the mob is now aggressive to you too.<br/>
<br/>
Because of (1) it&#39;s actually not uncommon for one of my party<br/>
to briefly become visible, the mob(s) charge him, and the next<br/>
pulse they all retarget me because I&#39;m a bard.  What can I<br/>
say, get good armor.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
You really have to watch out for (2) if you&#39;re in a group with<br/>
mixed factions.  If your paladin friend has to kill the<br/>
corrupt guard at the Freeport bank and your song pulses on him<br/>
while he fights, you will lose faction along with him.  If<br/>
your troll buddy gets whacked by the guards and one of your<br/>
songs pulses before he dies, the guards will be after you<br/>
next.<br/>
