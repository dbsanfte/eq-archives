Plus 1 pt/tick for your normal regeneration rate standing<br/>
(2 pts/tick if sitting).<br/>
<br/>
It gets upgraded by 1 pt/tick w/o lute, 2 pts/tick w/ lute<br/>
every 6 levels.  So...<br/>
<br/>
30-36: 6 pts/tick, 12 pts/tick<br/>
36-41: 7 pts/tick, 14 pts/tick<br/>
42-47: 8 pts/tick, 16 pts/tick<br/>
<br/>
At some level your normal regeneration rate gets upgraded to 3<br/>
pts/tick (not quite sure when or if this is sitting), which<br/>
would put it at 19 pts/tick at L42. Sitting gives you an extra<br/>
1 pt/tick, for 20 pts/tick.<br/>
