<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532302635"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Stop worrying.  SPDAT.EFF is a farcical file at best.  As a matter of fact<br/>
&gt; GZ posted a bunch of false data in it _on purpose_ because they don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; people knowing what&#39;s going in for Kunark.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The stuff going in for test is for testing.  I seriously doubt half of<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s listed goes into final.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  95% of what is listed in that file is live and in the game.  To suggest<br/>
  that half of it won&#39;t make it to final is pure speculation on your part.<br/>
  And that&#39;s what this all boils down to.  Everyone&#39;s best guess.<br/>
<br/>
  If those spells made it into the file this far, chances are they are<br/>
  going into the game.  Allbeit, their values/stats/effects may be tweaked <br/>
  you can count on those spells going live.  Such is my experience since<br/>
  early beta.  (And I don&#39;t mean the bogus InstantKill spell at the end<br/>
  of the file)<br/>

&gt; All you guys are doing is getting really worked up over something that may<br/>
&gt; or may not happen.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  And I hate people who think they know Verant&#39;s every move, tell others<br/>
  to chill out, that&#39;s it&#39;s just a game, and then proceed to compose an<br/>
  irritated mail about why they don&#39;t really care.<br/>
<br/>
  The people on this list genuinely care about their bards and the fact<br/>
  that no songs are even in the file for testing worries everyone on this<br/>
  list.  Songs were missing in beta, and never made it in.  I believe the<br/>
  same thing will transpire here.  The songs that I imagine being added<br/>
  will come one or two weeks before they ship the final for release, and <br/>
  those songs will be vague and poorly tested.  That comment is based on<br/>
  my 1.5 years of experience with Brad&#39;s team.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d love to have the undying support and optimism some people here<br/>
  try to enlighten us with, but the fact is if you let me down once,<br/>
  you let me down twice, you&#39;ll probably let me down three, four, or<br/>
  more times.  That is the Verant way.  They created a great game, <br/>
  however they are poorly supporting and adding to their creation.<br/>
  Until something wonderful happens, I will still remain doubtful.<br/>
