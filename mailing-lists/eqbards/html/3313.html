<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128666884">Alas, from my rogue friend&#39;s enthusiasm about agility I had hopes that it<br/>
actually meant something.  I fear strength, indeed, is the only statistic,<br/>
and the others have little or no impact.  One would hope that if someone<br/>
actually concentrated on another statistic besides strength they would reap<br/>
some reward.  Well, one can only hope that at least for rogues, high agility<br/>
helps as she believes.  (Hey, monks have their own physics, why not others?)<br/>
