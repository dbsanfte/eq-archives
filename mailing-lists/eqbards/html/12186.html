<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551662436">Agility definitely affects the armour worn modifier in some way.  At agility<br/>
of 70 the modifier is lower than 1.6, considerably lower.  I have some notes<br/>
on this I will try to dig up.  My research definitely showed that that<br/>
modifier (the 1.6 below) was determined by Agility, though not linearly.<br/>
There were definite modifier breaks on the 01&#39;s like 71 was better than 70,<br/>
but 74 was the same as 71 for example.<br/>

<br/>
Recent discussions on the effects of DEX versus STR on combat have led me to<br/>
share some stats of my own. I keep a notebook PC handy while playing, and<br/>
one of the things I use it for is to maintain an Excel spreadsheet with all<br/>
my equipment and stats on it. Over time, I&#39;ve added some formulas (based on<br/>
observation) to calculate my AC. The following is accurate to within a point<br/>
or two of AC at level 21:<br/>
<br/>
AC = (AGI/10) + (DEFENSE * 2.8) + (ARMOUR WORN * 1.6)<br/>
<br/>
This is only an approximation. AGI, for instance, seems to affect AC on a<br/>
non-linear scale; one point of AC per 10 points of AGI works with an AGI of<br/>
about 100-110. Effects of armour and defense are a little flakey, too, but<br/>
2.8 and 1.6 are close.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else have any info they&#39;d like to share?<br/>
