<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077334775">Notice when you go down that list of games with environmental audio presets, <br/>
they are all fairly old games... introduced before EAX extensions were <br/>
available.  Environmental audio presets are for games that do NOT have <br/>
environmental audio supports built into the game.  EQ uses the environmental <br/>
abilities of the sblive card already... any preset you use with the game <br/>
would likely deteriorate your experience.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure the creative labs website isn&#39;t just stating that EQ supports <br/>
EAX?  (can&#39;t check from here)<br/>

On a related note, according to the Creative labs website, there is a preset<br/>
Environment Audio setting for EQ for the SBLive soundcard.  I have been<br/>
unable to locate this setting.  I have been using the default Multi Speaker<br/>
setting for my soundcard.  Does anyone know if an Environmental Audio<br/>
setting for EQ exists and if so how I can go about downloading it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
