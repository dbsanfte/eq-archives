<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253415402">I have a question about 36th? song Versus Of Celerity. From what I was told<br/>
and have seen on the web etc this song is only listed as an AGIL buff. Thats<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, is that true? There is no attack speed to it? There is an<br/>
enchanter buff called Celerity which is an upgrade to their attack speed<br/>
spell Alacrity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
