&gt; Notice it says no ´┐¢direct save´┐¢. This means they don´┐¢t roll versus feign.<br/>
&gt; What they get is what amounts to an intelligence check, which every creature<br/>
&gt; gets for these ´┐¢I´┐¢m going to fool you so you don´┐¢t attack me´┐¢ abilities and<br/>
&gt; spells. It&#39;s a very low chance. All cases of direct saves have a much higher<br/>
&gt; percentage of the creature saving.<br/>
&gt; ***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What this seems to be saying is that any spell/effect which &quot;fools&quot;<br/>
&gt; creatures can be overcome by an intelligence check.  Since invisibility<br/>
&gt; &quot;fools&quot; monsters into thinking you&#39;re not there, it seems to me this would<br/>
&gt; account for the reason invisibility (whether bardic or from a caster) fails<br/>
&gt; occasionally.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been in situations where I was attacked (e.g.) by GIBS in Lower Guk,<br/>
&gt; when my Invis to Undead was still up (well, until they hit me), or where<br/>
&gt; (e.g.) I was attacked by silly lil&#39; ice gobbies in Permafrost while my<br/>
&gt; (druid-cast) invisibility was still up (well, until they hit me).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyways, just thought I might have found, accidentally, a reason for one of<br/>
&gt; the great mysteries of EQ life - why did they attack me when I was<br/>
&gt; invisible?<br/>
