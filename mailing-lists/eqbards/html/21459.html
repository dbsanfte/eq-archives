<div id="ygrps-yiv-361642147"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So here we have an item that&#39;s been dropping since the game started.  Been<br/>
working a certain way since the game started - and they don&#39;t like it - so<br/>
they nerf it.  But other things they don&#39;t like - they can&#39;t change because<br/>
players are used to it working a certain way even though it&#39;s broken.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They haven&#39;t nerfed it.  They&#39;ve fixed the way haste songs/spells interact<br/>
with haste items.  Previously, any haste item combined with a haste<br/>
song/spell was making the attacker hit at the haste cap.  Clearly a problem.<br/>
Ok, so we&#39;d gotten used to the &#39;bug&#39; and were taking advantage of it...<br/>
would you get pissed at your bank if their ATM was giving you 20&#39;s instead<br/>
of 10&#39;s and only debiting your account for 10&#39;s and they went and fixed it?<br/>
<br/>
The Mask, on the other hand, does nothing more than change the appearance of<br/>
the bearer and grant ultravision - hardly a balance-altering situation.  I<br/>
think by the time they could get the mask, their faction with the<br/>
IndigoBrothers (or whatever the Inkie faction is) would be so screwed that<br/>
any faction benefits gained from taking Inkie form would be negated.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s also been a shift in attitude as regards fixing items that<br/>
have been in existence for some time, something which I believe our esteemed<br/>
Internet Relations Manager has had quite a hand in.<br/>
