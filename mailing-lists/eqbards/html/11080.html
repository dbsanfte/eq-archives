&gt; Not to mention the other obvious - not all EQ players are &quot;kids&quot; that have<br/>
&gt; lots of free time. I work full time and take classes two nites a week... Who<br/>
&gt; has time to camp that sort of a spawn??? If they continue doing this sort of<br/>

(Knowledge = power.  And as anyone who has taken high school<br/>
physics knows, power = work/time.  So knowledge = work/money,<br/>
or money = work/knowledge.  Therefore, the less you know, the<br/>
more money you make.  :-)<br/>

In all seriousness, Verant has painted themselves into a<br/>
corner with the basic game design where nearly everything is<br/>
predictable.  The same mobs spawn in the same places carrying<br/>
the same items and can be killed using the same tactics.  The<br/>
only things that really require strategy are multi-mob fights,<br/>
and exploring.  Given the high degree of predictability, it&#39;s<br/>
virtually impossible to make things challenging - once you <br/>
figure out how it works, it&#39;s predictable, and no longer<br/>
challenging; so they&#39;re stuck with making things tedious.<br/>
