Bard Armor Recap and New Item Posted Monday, November 29, 1999 by Fyndhorn<br/>
To recap from my earlier update, Imbrued Platemail armor hasn&#39;t been found<br/>
for a while on any server. It is &quot;supposed&quot; to drop from Scorn Banshees,<br/>
female zombies from PoH, but it currently does not drop at all. So hopefully<br/>
by next patch, Verant will fix that up for all the Bards out there.<br/>
<br/>
On to equipment, Innoruuk from PoH seems to carry a HUGE plethora of<br/>
different items, and so we have found a new item drop from him today: the<br/>
Shield of the Immaculate, yet another item for Paladins only, which brings<br/>
the total of Paladin only stuff to 1 billion (j/k =p). Check it out.<br/>

Bards&#39; Imbrued Platemail Armor Posted Sunday, November 28, 1999 by Fyndhorn<br/>
As rumor has it, the BRD-only armor from PoF and PoH called Imbrued<br/>
Platemail hasn&#39;t been dropping at all since the Plane of Hate was first<br/>
introduced. Basically every mob in both the PoF and PoH have been killed and<br/>
not one piece of Imbrued has been dropped on the Fennin Ro server, so if<br/>
anyone has any info on what mob currently drops this armor, please drop us a<br/>
line: EQ&#39;lizer Staff</div>
