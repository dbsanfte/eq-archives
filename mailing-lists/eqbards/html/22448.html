<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234529133">Here&#39;s a quote from the guys at Mythic about the impact of losing the rights<br/>
to Rolemaster:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fortuantely, we&#39;ve had some time to make changes -- we&#39;ve known that this<br/>
may happen for a while now. <br/>
<br/>
As the beta testers can attest, we&#39;ve already changed the skill system to be<br/>
non-Rolemaster specific, and the magic system was so different from<br/>
Rolemaster to begin with that there won&#39;t be any trouble with it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the class/race names and abilities came from the legends of the<br/>
various lands, so the impact on the loss of the license should be minimal on<br/>
Camelot&#39;s development, especially at this early beta stage. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The combat system as implemented is already quite different from Rolemaster,<br/>
because we had to take into account the realities of online gaming, which<br/>
differ from the more slow pace of a tabletop roleplaying game. So, we won&#39;t<br/>
have too much work to do to make that non-Rolemaster.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think DAoC will be delayed due to losing Rolemaster.<br/>

Not necessarily so.  When Fallout was being developed, Interplay was<br/>
initially using the GURPS RPG system as their base stat/skill system.  But<br/>
fairly late into the development process, they lost the GURPS license and<br/>
had to create their own stats/skill system from scratch.  Now I don&#39;t know<br/>
how long this delayed release, but I don&#39;t think it was very long.  The<br/>
developers of DAoC can work on areas such as graphics, AI, client/server<br/>
interface, etc. while they develop a new stat/skill system.<br/>

Nope, count DAoC out.  Since ICE just folded, they&#39;ve lost the rights to <br/>
the role-playing game engine they were using as a core for the <br/>
game.  Contrary to statements to the otherwise, there is no way that they <br/>
can develop a new engine that is stable and decent in time to meet their <br/>
schedule.  There WILL be delays.<br/>

P.S. Shadowbane does look good in terms of gameplay - but the graphics look <br/>
pretty bad still.<br/>
