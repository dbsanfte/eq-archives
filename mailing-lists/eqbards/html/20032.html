stupid as to think their way is the only way and won&#39;t listen when you give<br/>
them advice.<br/>
<br/>
I know a level 54 bard on my server (who will remain unnamed) who lost a<br/>
duel to a level 55 monk of all things.  3 times in a row he lost.  He<br/>
absolutely refused to listen to me when I tried to tell him how to more<br/>
effectively fight.  The fool kept trying to melee.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, as a high level bard twice over, I feel it&#39;s my JOB to learn my<br/>
class better.  I&#39;ve taught some lessons on the message boards and email list<br/>
(mostly here though) and I&#39;ve learned many lessons as well.  Bards, more<br/>
than ANY other class, really need to learn to play their class well.  And<br/>
the only way to do that is to talk to, give advice to, and listen to, other<br/>
bards.  That&#39;s how those of us who are considered &quot;Good&quot; bards got to BE<br/>
&quot;Good&quot; bards.<br/>
<br/>
I consider myself Adequate as a bard but people in my guild who&#39;ve been<br/>
around 90% of the bards on the server keep telling me that I&#39;m the best bard<br/>
they&#39;ve grouped with.  &quot;You never sing less than 3 or 4 songs, you know when<br/>
to switch and you are always where you&#39;re needed most&quot;.  In short, I pay<br/>
attention to what&#39;s going on.  I also never twist between fights.  They get<br/>
mana song, or heal song.  Depending on how badly the tanks are hurt and how<br/>
bad the casters need mana.  If it&#39;s REAL bad I&#39;ll twist but between fights<br/>
they like me to tell them stories ;)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate.  Yah the younger generation has it easier than those of us who<br/>
are a tad long in the tooth did but there are STILL young, and old, bards<br/>
out there who don&#39;t have the first clue how to play a bard properly.  If you<br/>
look around at the population in Faydwer and in Qeynos you will see dozens<br/>
of bards below level 15<br/>
<br/>
If you look around the SERVER at around level 30-40 you will see far fewer<br/>
bards.  And only about 10% of them are &quot;good&quot; at what they do.  At level 50+<br/>
there are far fewer bards than almost any other class.  I think Rogues have<br/>
us beat but not by much.<br/>
<br/>
Uhhhh where was I going with this anyway? :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah!  Just because someone is an &#39;old&#39; bard really isn&#39;t an excuse not<br/>
to know what they&#39;re doing ;)  The resources ARE available to them too ya<br/>
know ;)<br/>
