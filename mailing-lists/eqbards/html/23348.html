<div id="ygrps-yiv-296881622">Interesting - I never have used my instruments during a fight. I&#39;m currently<br/>
level 21 - actually now that I think about it, I&#39;m level 20, I died<br/>
yesterday :(. Is just using my weapons in battle normal for my level? Should<br/>
I expect to be using my instruments a lot more often when I hit a certain<br/>
level?<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord uses Brass instruments and I<br/>
haven&#39;t used the song yet. Is it a useful song? I don&#39;t really like to sing<br/>
AE songs in battle since it causes problems right quick - although I do like<br/>
Largos as it has a pretty small radius. Are all of our good songs going to<br/>
be AE? Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord would be awesome if I could sing it<br/>
without fear that I&#39;m going to pull everything in the zone...<br/>

&gt; And a lot of bards; granted there are a lot of people who LIKE using their<br/>
&gt; weapons and more power to them (this is a game after all) - but I&#39;m amazed<br/>
&gt; by the number of group members who tell me that they&#39;ve never seen a bard<br/>
&gt; not using weapons during a fight (and I&#39;m talking at places like<br/>
Sebelis)...<br/>

&gt; Was camping the moat corners in Karnors this weekend.  Had a warrior, a<br/>
&gt; second bard, wizard, cleric and enchanter in the group.  I was weaving the<br/>
&gt; three chants (with Selos drum) during every fight.  Based on the numbers<br/>
&gt; posted on the www.eqsongs.com website, I was doing around 172pts of damage<br/>
&gt; per tick (when all 3 stuck).  As many people have stated before on this<br/>
&gt; list, this is a helluva lot more damage than I can do with weapons<br/>
equipped.<br/>
&gt; Like Minkin, I was doing so much damage to the mob that it almost always<br/>
&gt; ignored the warrior and attacked me.  Still amazes me though when other<br/>
&gt; classes ask me why I am not meleeing with weapons.  Even though the game<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; been out for almost two years, there are still a lot of people who don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; realize what all a bard can do.<br/>
