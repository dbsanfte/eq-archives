<br/>
They are an uber-guild, probably THE uber guild of EQ.  They power game<br/>
and they&#39;re darn good at it.<br/>
<br/>
However I think a lot of they&#39;re bad rep comes from a few bad apples. <br/>
Unfortunatly they don&#39;t kick those bad apples out because they would<br/>
lose power if they did.<br/>
<br/>
They held one of the biggest server events I&#39;ve ever heard of every<br/>
month (its on hold because of ROK).  Basically one week of a good vs<br/>
evil war, the zones from Neriak to Grobb become a battle ground of mass<br/>
PvP warfare, pretty fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There leader (Krimson) seems pretty set on improving their relations<br/>
with the rest of the server.<br/>
