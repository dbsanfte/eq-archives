&gt;Theres a maximum CHA for price getting?  ANyone know what it is?  That may <br/>
&gt;explain a good deal actually since it also seems to me that I get no <br/>
&gt;difference in price between a amiable and indifferent vendor (both in <br/>
&gt;freeport, hadn&#39;t used CHA song)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There sure is... it&#39;s somewhere between 100 and 120 CHA that prices bottom <br/>
out (I don&#39;t remember exactly where, it&#39;s been months since I tested it).  <br/>
My base CHA is 132 now, with my Crude Stein (CHA 147) prices are unchanged. <br/>
In order to test this, check prices on expensive items like gems... raising <br/>
charisma from 50 to 200 might not appreciably change the cost of muffins. = <br/>
)<br/>
<br/>
Faction has a limited impact on price as well.  There&#39;s definitely a <br/>
difference between apprehensive and amiable, but I&#39;ve never seen a <br/>
difference between amiable and kindly.  When I play Cinda&#39;s I typically go <br/>
up several faction standings, so it&#39;s hard to say at what point faction <br/>
ceases to help prices.<br/>
<br/>
The long and the short of it is, charisma and faction can contribute to a <br/>
combined difference in cost of perhaps 40% of the total cost (from worst <br/>
case to best case) but in most situations it&#39;s far less than this.  I know, <br/>
for example, that a druid friend of mine can buy gate potions for about <br/>
1400pp, while they cost me around 1100pp (no, never bought one, but I like <br/>
to window shop).  That&#39;s a 27% difference, and quite a bit of cash to save.  <br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t give exact answers - for what it&#39;s worth, CHA 110, faction <br/>
amiable is my guess for where prices bottom out.<br/>
