<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990083303">Some time ago our guild was doing a raid of MistMoore when who to my bardly <br/>
eyes should appear but Equestrielle, the unicorn.  One of our high-levels <br/>
took her down and gave me her horn.  Yes, it&#39;s a wind instrument, acts as a <br/>
light source, and has 4 charges of Purge as I&#39;m sure many of you already <br/>
know.  I checked various websites and was disappointed to say the least that <br/>
it doesn&#39;t add a bonus to wind-based songs like some of the other magical <br/>
instruments do.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, I was bored and running around North Karana looking for HG&#39;s to <br/>
charm (in the event there were two) or kite (if only one) when I ran across <br/>
GrimFeather.  I get a kick out of kiting Grimmy if only for the number of <br/>
times he killed me back when I was young.  He still gets a few hits in, but <br/>
for the most part, I&#39;m faster than him at 40 with just a MM drum (I still <br/>
have to get the guild to raid Kaesora for my final coin.. hehe).  After <br/>
killing Grimmy, I hit tracking to see what was up, and lo, Zahal the Vile!  <br/>
So I kited him (he was blue to me at 40, which was scary considering I had <br/>
seen on some site that he was supposed to be level 16.  Of course after <br/>
killing Zahal, I had to hunt down Regis (I have a cleric twink...)   He was <br/>
green to me but a nasty caster.  I would have died to this greenie if a <br/>
passing druid hadn&#39;t healed me.<br/>
<br/>
Now, one of the items used in the cleric bracer quest is a flute that Regis <br/>
drops.  I decided to test if it could be used as a wind instrument just for <br/>
kicks.  The standard method of testing this that I&#39;ve heard mentioned so <br/>
many times on this list is Pixie Striking yourself and checking the Magic <br/>
Resist loss.  So, I pull out my trusty unicorn horn (the only wind <br/>
instrument I usually carry with me) knowing that it has no bonus, and pixie <br/>
strike myself repeatedly until it sticks.  Then I noted my MR loss.  Waited <br/>
until it wore off, and then tried it with the quest flute from Regis.  Hmmm, <br/>
it was LESS MR loss than the unicorn horn.  No, sorry, I didn&#39;t write down <br/>
the numbers and do more extensive testing (my regular group was starting to <br/>
get together).<br/>
<br/>
But, I decided that it was my bardic duty to let all of you know my <br/>
findings.  I&#39;ll try the experiment again with a standard store-bought flute <br/>
just to make sure that Regis&#39; girlfriend&#39;s flute isn&#39;t somehow cursed with a <br/>
negative wind instruments bonus or something.  Plus it&#39;s so hard to get <br/>
Pixie Strike to hit an even-con mob (ie. myself) as you all know (much less <br/>
a green one... hehe).  One quick question:  When you get the secondary <br/>
resist you still get the full MR debuff but no stun, right?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one more thing.  I&#39;ve had the unicorn for almost 6 months now and <br/>
never used the Purge effect.  While running past the gnolls in Lake Rathe <br/>
one of those stupid shammy gnolls actually managed to stick Strong Disease <br/>
on me (my MR, CR, and HR are good, but PR and DR are low).  I played Psalm <br/>
of Vitality forever and it mentioned several times that I had been cured <br/>
(actually I was probably playing Psalm of Purity and it was curing poison <br/>
every time... hehe) without actually removing the disease.  So I got <br/>
frustrated and used Purge for the first time ever.  Bah, didn&#39;t work... =8^P <br/>
  Eventually the disease just wore off.<br/>
