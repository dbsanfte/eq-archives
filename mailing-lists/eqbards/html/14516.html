<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792246466">Sometimes being a UberSemiNaziDictator is a tough job.  I&#39;m only human, I <br/>
make mistakes, as we all do.  As I so rapidly recanted my warning to <br/>
Harmonic, so do I now recant one of my two warnings to Steelwolf, aka <br/>
Ariell Thunderwolff.  I am not perfect, and I&#39;m afraid that I leapt to the <br/>
wrong conclusion when I saw the method that the message had been <br/>
posted.  Ariell apparently made a mistake in his transmission - he intended <br/>
to send a quoted version, not to make it look like Harmonic had sent it.<br/>
So, with that in mind, I do apologize to Ariell.<br/>
Unfortunately, Ariell chose (of his own volition) to unsubscribe earlier <br/>
today, so I am CC&#39;ing this message to him.  If you wish to say anything to <br/>
him, or protest his choice, please feel free to email him directly.<br/>
<br/>
In spite of this, I do still stand by my original decision.  Posting <br/>
private email to this list is bad form.  Doing it as a method of flaming or <br/>
to provoke someone else into flaming back is not allowed. Period.  We&#39;re <br/>
all adults here, and this is an open, public forum.  There is no need to <br/>
play &quot;He said she said!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s all learn to get along, and get back to talking about cool Bard stuff.<br/>
