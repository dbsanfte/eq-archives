<b>Subject:</b> Solusek Eye and the Lava Elemental <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680743902">Greetings I am in need of some bardic tactics and advice.<br/>
<br/>
Some friends and I want to take on the Lava Elemental in Solusek Eye. Can anyone give me any advice<br/>
on how best to approach this mob and his surrounding friends? I know there are 4 CWG&#39;s around and<br/>
either a 5th wanderer or the Lava Elemental. But I have seen nothing on the web of how to approach<br/>
him. And few people I have spoken with seem to know.<br/>
<br/>
The group will be:<br/>
<br/>
Bard (me) Level 29 or 30, depending how much I get to play, but lately the Steel Golem area in Cazic<br/>
has been a level every 4-5 hours. :-)..<br/>
Troll Shaman Level 41 and Pet.<br/>
Troll SK Level 40<br/>
Ogre Warrior Level 34<br/>
Hafling Druid Level 31.<br/>
Maybe another Cleric if they can make it. Only level 26 though or anyone else we can pick up.<br/>
<br/>
Questions I have:<br/>
<br/>
1. Can I lull pull to get 1 or 2 at a time? I have never killed a CWG or a gnome but the evils have.<br/>
2. Will I be able to stun the mobs or do I need another couple of levels?<br/>
3. I know the CWG&#39;s are very resistant to Magic and mostly melee but can they be charmed?<br/>
4. Can this group take and hold the room?<br/>
5. Any other advice? My spell selection will probably be Psalm, Hym, Charm, Pixie, Anthem or Chant,<br/>
Lullaby, Lull, and Group invis.<br/>
<br/>
If you would rather send it to my home email feel free as I am asking for some spoiler advice.<br/>
