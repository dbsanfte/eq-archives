<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603491428">Or it could make you realize why you&#39;re bored with your bard. While I like<br/>
my bard character, getting into another role really changed my<br/>
disappointment with the game. I also suggest you pick one of the newer<br/>
servers so you don&#39;t see the huge gap among players your level due to<br/>
twinking. That alone makes a big difference.<br/>

Also, if you feel somewhat tired of the &lt;gasp&gt; Bard class right now, you<br/>
think you&#39;ve done and seen it all.... Remember you&#39;ve got 7 other character<br/>
spots (and over a hundred on all available servers) to try your hand at the<br/>
things you&#39;ve seen others do, that you wished you could, too!  A small<br/>
period of time in another shell should be enuf to remind you why you were a<br/>
Bard in the first place. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The dungeons are the big thing. Being level 17 I&#39;d assume you haven&#39;t been<br/>
&gt;in Cazic-Thule or Solusek? There are some nice things in there that are<br/>
&gt;better than bronze plate and combines. Keep going till you have full<br/>
&gt;Rubicite (or Emerald) and a pair of Demon Claws. =)<br/>

&gt; Good Journey,<br/>

&gt;Hello all . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a Level 17 Bard. As such I am about that age where I have almost<br/>
&gt;completed my set of bronze armor. I already have 2 combine longswords, so<br/>
&gt;pretty soon I&#39;ll be as equipped as I ever really need to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To those of you who have reached and passed this point in the game, I would<br/>
&gt;like to know what it is that keeps you going? I&#39;ve seen basically every<br/>
&gt;zone, got everything I need. In real life this is the time I would finally<br/>
&gt;settle down and spend time with my family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just looking for tips on what to do now . . .<br/>
