<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056762008">true, a very nice item to have around.  i now carry one, from all the recent<br/>
times i have gone in alone to retrieve my corpse in PoF (got tired of<br/>
waiting for someone to help me out, and the corpse timer is running),<br/>
standing on a ledge, shivering while playing my invis song surrounded by 40<br/>
corpses waiting for someone to come get me.<br/>
<br/>
only thing is, you can only carry one.  they are lore.  do i know this for<br/>
sure?  no, but this is what the monk who was lying on the ground next to me<br/>
that time told me when i asked if he had an extra for me other than the one<br/>
he was waiting to use.<br/>
