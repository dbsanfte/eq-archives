<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lavastorm = No - I think they&#39;ll crank up the xp modifier for Najena, and<br/>
&gt; make it worth being bound in FP for the light races to take the risk.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Other<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than that, it&#39;s too close to Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Making the Temple of Sol Ro a bindable zone would help a ton. SolA is mostly<br/>
farming, with a close bind you&#39;d actually see some activity there since it<br/>
really can be a good group zone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; South Karana = Unk - No if they reason that Arena is only 2 zone lines<br/>
 </span></blockquote>away.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes if they decide it&#39;s too hard to get a bind in Arena, since there is<br/>
&gt; normally nobody in there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard a few mentions of the Stone bridge in NK to support the Karana<br/>
area, only problem with that is a lot of races aren&#39;t on good terms with the<br/>
Qeynos guards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron = No - Gfay and Kaladim are both close.  Kedge would<br/>
&gt; probably get a small xp modifier boost, and Unrest an even larger one, to<br/>
&gt; entice the lower levels to try, who have a harder time travelling Dagnors.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are right, the other zones are close enough. If given a choice I go with<br/>
Kaladim, it&#39;s a little further but sometimes GFay is lagfest. Kedge, I love<br/>
that place and a higher xp mod would be great (it&#39;s 3rd now not counting<br/>
Velious) but they really need to reitimize it, add a few rare random drops<br/>
and the zone will be popular again. Distance from a bind point has never<br/>
slowed down Kedge activity, it&#39;s a zone that has a huge xp mod but no loot<br/>
to speak of usually.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OOT = Unk - Could go either way.  Due to only being able to zone by boat,<br/>
&gt; the arguments are strong in either case.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On Seafury Island there&#39;s a druid ring, make it an active port. The zone is<br/>
just a pain in the neck to get into. Binds in the zone would make things<br/>
easier but I&#39;m not sure it will increase the use of the zone. They have<br/>
proved they can limit binds to a section of a zone with FV and OT, put a<br/>
gypsy camp (on betaneutral faction) in these zones and you can only bind<br/>
there within that camp.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lfay = No - Only 1 zone away from Gfay, and the spires.  Although the<br/>
&gt; pathing is broke, they could probably even get away without increasing the<br/>
&gt; xp modifier for Mistmoore.  It&#39;s always been relatively popular despite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; faults.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reitemize I&#39;m betting and fixing some pathing, even with some of the more<br/>
interesting new additions (DEs, corrupt brownies) it&#39;s still passable for<br/>
people wanting to hunt in Mistmore. As a zone itself, very underused but<br/>
those new camps is the reason, I had a character who was working the orc<br/>
camps at one point and I gave up after a DE pathed back through us after<br/>
chasing down and killing someone else.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Innothule = Yes - Despite being only 1 zone from Upper Guk, it is a good<br/>
&gt; midpoint between arena and Freeport.  Will perhaps be a &quot;camp&quot; of some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>type,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with light aligned guards?  The points for, taking into consideration the<br/>
&gt; zones around it, to me seem to outweight the points against, regarding the<br/>
&gt; proximity to Lguk.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same as OOT, place a small circle of NPCs on betaneutral faction. Lower Guk<br/>
isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s upper guk which is probably underhunted. Lower is<br/>
still active because there&#39;s still some good stuff there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Everfrost = Yes - A dark aligned camp would be most likely, since light<br/>
&gt; aligned folks can bind in Halas.  Fixing Permafrost will also help,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>though.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; :)  Might as well be named Permatrain, as it is now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Random item drops in Perma would make it Very interesting. Bad pathing and<br/>
warping going away would be great but if there&#39;s some decent loot people<br/>
will put up with those problems. Also if the zone scaled up a little better<br/>
it would help, I think in the upper 20s it starts to green out and at that<br/>
level you can&#39;t break the king room.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kunark and Velious - I just don&#39;t have enough knowledge of these zones.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kunark is limited to FV and LOIO, with some FM thrown in, and my Velious<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; limited to Frankel the Pirate in N Ro.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Change the EJ port from an evac to a regular port as well as an evac. That<br/>
alone will open up most of the rest of the zones. Right now if you want to<br/>
go to CoM from East Commons, you get a port to DL, then run to Karnor&#39;s and<br/>
evac to EJ. 30-45 minutes under the best conditions.<br/>
