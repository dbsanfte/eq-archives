<div id="ygrps-yiv-420536581"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Cool Harm, what the Shield from Berserker Strength read?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Berserker Strength shows as HP Absorb Shield (this is what Niv&#39;s<br/>
  really is btw)  [Protective Skin is misworded]  The shield is what<br/>
  I refer to as &#39;Rune shielding&#39; after the Rune series.  Our new<br/>
  song is half as powerful as the Berserker Strength shielding<br/>
  (Enchanter 20).<br/>
<br/>
  The Strength component is slightly better than the Shaman L29<br/>
  spell called Raging Strength.  The new song has the same <br/>
  Strength component as the Berserker Strength (Enchanter L20)<br/>
<br/>
  The Max HP component is close to 3/4&#39;s the component of the<br/>
  Cleric 9 Center spell.<br/>
<br/>
  For all purposes, this new song resemebles the Enchanter<br/>
  Berserker Strength spell across all party members.<br/>
<br/>
  It has half the range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando, and slightly<br/>
  more range than Hymm, and close to equal range of Chant of Battle.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
