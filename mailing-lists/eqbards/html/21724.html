<div id="ygrps-yiv-158710650">As I am running on a DSL connection, would I gain any benefit from using a<br/>
firewall such as Black Ice?<br/>
<br/>
My pc isn&#39;t networked (yet) and I&#39;m wondering if I need that sort of<br/>
security.<br/>

stealths your ports making your systems nearly invisible on the net.  The<br/>
interface also hot links back to thier website if you want to read up on the<br/>
kind of attacks/probes it is blocking.<br/>
