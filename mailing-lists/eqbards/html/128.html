<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-859626683">In concerts past, I simply played Hymn of Restoration (uses the lute and<br/>
doesn&#39;t anger anyone nearby), which plays the midi music (though I don&#39;t know<br/>
if others can hear it) and makes you go through the strumming motion.<br/>
<br/>
Then I typed my song in manually, line by line, trying to follow the rhythm<br/>
of the song.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanics of it are clumsy.<br/>
<br/>
If your song is not too long, and you are only singing one or two songs, you<br/>
could program it into social buttons, but you would then end up &quot;chunking&quot;<br/>
the song out in big blocks.  If you aren&#39;t a good typist, this may be the<br/>
best option though.<br/>

&gt; I have yet to have the opportunity to attend a concert in Norrath so my<br/>
&gt; question is about performance mechanics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I assume there is no way to provide actual music.  Let your imagination a<br/>
&gt; bit loose and consider that perhaps someday Verant will let us feed in a<br/>
&gt; MIDI or .wav file that then goes to the listeners.  The bandwidth needed<br/>
&gt; for a MIDI might even be within reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I further assume that you simply supply the words for all those nearby<br/>
&gt; to read.  Is there a way to do that in reasonable quantity without having<br/>
&gt; to type them as you go?  Do you perhaps set up chunks of the words as<br/>
&gt; command macros, then touch those off one at a time in order?<br/>
