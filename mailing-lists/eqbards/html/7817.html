<div id="ygrps-yiv-615343991"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; I am finding as I am going to more and more grouped dungeon settings that<br/>
&gt;&gt; the monsters are concentrating on me more than anyone else in the group.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Everyone is asking if I am singing chords or dissonance (which I don&#39;t<br/>

&gt;Between L10-15 is the worst time for this as a bard.  It<br/>
&gt;continues to be bad if you use Lullaby liberally after L15.<br/>
&gt;Starting at L20, it starts to ease off as the other melee<br/>
&gt;classes start getting their damage bonuses and extra attacks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems to be the case for me as well. All extra mobs on a pull will<br/>
attack me almost 100% of the time. And any passing mob will attack me when<br/>
it joins in a fight.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if it is because I&#39;m playing Hymn? I&#39;m guessing that when the<br/>
mobs come over and they&#39;re not really mad at anyone yet (just a little bit<br/>
at the puller) then they&#39;ll want to attack me since I&#39;m healing. Or is it<br/>
the vague &quot;Bard Hate&quot; thing. :) What do you guys think?<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to try to NOT play Hymn at the very beginning of a battle<br/>
(so far I&#39;m always twisting Anthem and Hymn, even in the very beginning when<br/>
no one is hurt). Hopefully the mobs that are not being fought yet will hit<br/>
the tanks and/or puller, and then several rounds later when I start to play<br/>
Hymn they won&#39;t be so mad at me.<br/>
