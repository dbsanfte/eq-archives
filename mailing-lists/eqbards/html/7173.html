<div id="ygrps-yiv-926053216">Might be the Enchanters.  I regular give Strenght & Haze to the pet of my 6th<br/>
lvl Enchantress.  This gives her a little better chance if she is solo&#39;ing.<br/>
Think it might be Verant urging me to group more, at the higher lvls.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Playing a necro as well im wondering what the pet buff thing is about...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Pets with greater than 20 hit points cannot receive hit point buffs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a grouping thing, your necro wouldn&#39;t understand. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looks like they don&#39;t like pets having any of the cleric or druid hp<br/>
&gt; buffs. Not sure what &quot;balance&quot; issue they have in mind with this. I<br/>
&gt; guess you could level a lower level magician or necro pretty quick if<br/>
&gt; you had a high level cleric cast resolution on it. Guess we&#39;ll have to<br/>
&gt; see who complains after it goes live to figure out why they did it.<br/>
