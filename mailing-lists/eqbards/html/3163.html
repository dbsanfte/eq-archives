mainly to pull one monster from a crowd.  Think my skill is up to 4 now.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if your range is based on the weapon or not, but I&#39;ve found<br/>
that the range of the throwing knife is _just_ barely outside the range<br/>
an aggro will notice you.  I once stepped too close to the ruins in East<br/>
Commonlands and ended up doing the Selo Shanty to avoid a buch of ghouls<br/>
when I only wanted the zombie.<br/>
