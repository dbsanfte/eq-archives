<div id="ygrps-yiv-34553627">On E&#39;ci of just plain level 50&#39;s there is over 100+. May even be up to 200<br/>

&gt;&gt; Brad has already stated publicly that the majority of their customers<br/>
&gt;&gt; have mid level characters. He stated this when Paw was upgraded so you<br/>
&gt;&gt; can take his &quot;mid level&quot; as someone suitable to play Paw. As Brad has<br/>
&gt;&gt; direct access to the customer database, I think this provides a perfect<br/>
&gt;&gt; example of the uselessness of web polls. The only thing that poll tells<br/>
&gt;&gt; you is that 6% of the people who go to everlore and bothered to take the<br/>
&gt;&gt; poll (and only voted once) have a 45+ character. I hope you can<br/>
&gt;&gt; understand the difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bear in mind that what you as a player see in the game is<br/>
&gt;going to be inaccurate too.  When you take a random sample of<br/>
&gt;players you see in the game, there are two biases:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Your level.  If you&#39;re high level, you&#39;re spending more<br/>
&gt;time in high level zones, and thus see mostly high level<br/>
&gt;people.  If you&#39;re low level, you&#39;re spending more time in low<br/>
&gt;level zones, and thus see mostly low level people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.  High level.  How do you get to high level?  By spending<br/>
&gt;lots of time playing the game.  So whereas ten L20 players<br/>
&gt;might play a cumulative 40 hours a week, a single L50 player<br/>
&gt;might play 40 hours a week.  The result is that you see this<br/>
&gt;L50 player online as often as you see the ten L20 players.<br/>
&gt;Or put another way, your perception is that there are as many<br/>
&gt;L50 players as there are L20 players - for every single L20<br/>
&gt;player you see, there is a L50 player online - when in fact<br/>
&gt;there are really 10 times as many L20 players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I really don&#39;t think there are that many high level players<br/>
&gt;(L45+) in the game.  They just have a greater presence because<br/>
&gt;they put more hours into the game.  If we were paying for the<br/>
&gt;game by the hour, then they&#39;d have clout proportional to their<br/>
&gt;playtime.  But we&#39;re all paying a flat fee.  I really hope<br/>
&gt;Verant knows what side their bread is buttered on.  (And FWIW,<br/>
&gt;my main character is L45.)<br/>
