<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508615084">Well, I think that the Innoruuk guilds with the largest high-level presence (which isn&#39;t exactly the same<br/>
thing, but I suspect it&#39;s close enough) are, in no particular order:<br/>
<br/>
LoD (Legions of Darkness?  never quite sure)<br/>
Pantheon (Sylly&#39;s?)<br/>
Storm<br/>
Order of the Black Staff (mine and Harmonic&#39;s)<br/>
<br/>
OBS has about 140 not counting twinks.  I think the others are in the ballpark.  LoD is considered the<br/>
&quot;uber-guild&quot; of the server, for what that&#39;s worth.<br/>
<br/>
Kenross Cantoforjado, 49.7 songs, Innoruuk (aargh, I&#39;ll never to 50, much less 60!)<br/>
<br/>
PS - Feel free to send me a /tell if you have any questions.  If I&#39;m on.  :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I am still new to EQ and Innoruuk as a whole so I have to ask...  What<br/>
&gt; guilds are considered the biggest?  Because I play during the servers<br/>
&gt; off-peak hours (Aussie time) I tend to see a lot of guilds with only one or<br/>
&gt; two members in them.  But with about 500 players on at the time there&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; much to represent :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I am not asking because I want to be part of a &quot;big&quot; guild but just<br/>
&gt; curious.  I don&#39;t want to give anyone the wrong impression :)  Besides my<br/>
&gt; little one is already questing to join the guild most suited for her - size<br/>
&gt; or not!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
