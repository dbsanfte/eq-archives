&gt; &gt;I would take preferance to singing Anthem, and switch to healing (and step<br/>

&gt; Once again, when we&#39;re getting hit in excess of 60 points per swing, even<br/>

If everyone is wounded, and if the song heals just 5 points<br/>
per tick with your weapons equipped, for a six person party<br/>
that&#39;s 30 points of healing per tick, which can substantially<br/>
offset even 60 points damage per swing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any right answer to which songs to use.<br/>
It all depends on the circumstances.  Figuring it out is the<br/>
fun of playing a bard.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another use I found for Lullaby is saving your party when a<br/>
hopelessly red train gets dumped on it.  The song *really*<br/>
pisses off the monsters, so you fire it up until you have<br/>
their attention, then hit accelerando and lead them away from<br/>
your party.<br/>
<br/>
I heard the maximum number of mobs affected by it was limited<br/>
to 4 for playbalance reasons.  I have no problem with that,<br/>
but it seems to me that even when the song is already working<br/>
on 4 mobs, it still gets other mobs nearby (who are not being<br/>
affected by the song and are normally non-aggressive) mad at<br/>
me.  It&#39;s hard to keep calm when 4 mobs are beating on you and<br/>
3 more join the fray, so I can&#39;t say I&#39;m certain about this.  <br/>
But that&#39;s the impression I&#39;m getting of how it works.<br/>
