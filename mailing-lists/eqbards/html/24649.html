<div id="ygrps-yiv-900209116">I said in my example that when the warrior got the crscent blade, I was<br/>
given his lammy,  Of course we discovered I can&#39;t wield it, so it went on to<br/>
another member.  To be honest I don&#39;t think I should have been given the<br/>
lammy in any case.  I currently wield Sinoche&#39;s Partisan and Trolloch&#39;s<br/>
Skien (10/25 5pois, procs a poison based whirl type stun, off hand only).<br/>
The Lamentation is equal to the Partisan, and worth 2-3x as much.  And<br/>
certainly worth more than an off hand weapon for a class that doesnt melee<br/>
all the time and doesn&#39;t get double attack.<br/>
<br/>
Getting warriors weapons should be a top priority of a guild.  Warriors are<br/>
critical for many raids, they tend to live the longest and need to have<br/>
every oppurtunity to keep the mob taunted on them.  Behind them fall in all<br/>
the other melees, then behind that gaggle bards.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I don&#39;t understand<br/>
why bards get upset when weapons are awarded to other classes first...<br/>
