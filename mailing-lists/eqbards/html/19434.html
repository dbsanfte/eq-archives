<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633581393">Let me rephrase that:<br/>
It&#39;s not the GM&#39;s fault that the PLAYERS can&#39;t respect events enough not to<br/>
ruin it for themselves.<br/>

I agree with you 100%.  The question is will Verant do anything about it on<br/>
a consistent basis?  I remember right before Kunark came out there was an<br/>
event in Mistmoore where Mayong was controlled by a GM.  The entire event<br/>
was strictly text based, i.e. the GM was telling a story, an elven slave was<br/>
tortured etc.  They weren&#39;t killing everyone in the zone.  Some level 50s<br/>
zoned in and started attacking Mayong while the GM was still telling the<br/>
story.  So what happened?  The GM teleported them all to Tox forest to get<br/>
them out of the zone.  This is how every GM event should be run.  Players<br/>
should get some kind of warning we they enter the zone that the event is<br/>
geared towards a certain level range and any player higher than that is not<br/>
allowed to participate.  They can watch but not attack or assist.  If they<br/>
don&#39;t play by the rules they get teleported out of the zone.  Verant did it<br/>
with the Mayong event so that means they can do it with others if they want.<br/>
