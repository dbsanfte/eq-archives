<div id="ygrps-yiv-287097236">When I play:  Anytime I am not at work or in bed<br/>
<br/>
Longest play: 24 hours<br/>
<br/>
Game sounds: Only got them a couple of weeks ago, but now full blast!  So the one previous post<br/>
about being the only deaf bard in Norrath isn&#39;t true.  =)  Made for some GREAT roleplay.  When I<br/>
didn&#39;t have sound, I&#39;d listen to... erm *blush* Final Fantasy music, Castlevania music, and other<br/>
gaming music...<br/>
<br/>
Distance from display:  Pretty close to my 14-inch monitor *sighs loudly*<br/>
<br/>
TV:  Don&#39;t own one, don&#39;t miss it.   Didn&#39;t watch it Pre-EQ either.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Favorite beverage:  Coca-Cola, the REAL thing!<br/>
<br/>
Alcohol:  None, never drink.  Well, my bard does, but not the real-life bard here!<br/>
<br/>
Health food:  a &#39;peasant&#39; salad - head of lettuce cut in six wedges and dipped in ranch dressing.<br/>
Easy one-hand EQ eating!<br/>
<br/>
Junk Food:  Pizza and brownies!<br/>
<br/>
Clothes to wear:  Always in my medieval bloomers.<br/>
