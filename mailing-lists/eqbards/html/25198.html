	Subject:	RE: [eqbards] Walrus Skin Drum<br/>
<br/>
	I have a tambourine already - main point is I have a friend who got<br/>
the drum<br/>
	and will give it me at a 50 pct discount of the &quot;going&quot; rate.  I<br/>
want to see<br/>
	that she s fairly compensated - as long as it is &quot;within my budget&quot;<br/>
if you<br/>
	know what I mean!<br/>
	<br/>
	BTW - you didn&#39;t sign it - so I&#39;m not sure what server you on.  I no<br/>
longer<br/>
	have access to eqprices - (I&#39;m too cheap to pay them for it!) is<br/>
that 3K for<br/>
	Xegony?<br/>
	<br/>
	Thanks<br/>

	I did some testing on this.  Chant of battle at 51 is 30 str and dex<br/>
with a<br/>
	hand drum.<br/>
	With Nostolo tamborine it is 37 str and dex<br/>
	With Walrus skin drum it is 39 str and dex<br/>
	Guess that makes it about even with sharksin drum and on eq prices<br/>
that is<br/>
	around 3k.  But for the money, I think it would be cheaper to just<br/>
buy your<br/>
	tamborine quest coins and get that.  Better graphic too.<br/>
