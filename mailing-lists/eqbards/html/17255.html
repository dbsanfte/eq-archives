<div id="ygrps-yiv-190299077">Thanks for the support Bril!  I think if our guild didn&#39;t have two<br/>
enchanters there would be a lot more interest in keeping the bards leveling.<br/>
I think since all the caster know the enchanters will both have Clarity long<br/>
before any of the bards get manasong, they aren&#39;t too concerned about it.<br/>
By the time they realize they actually need tanks its liable to be too late.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Tank Bard <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hail and well met,<br/>
<br/>
My group has the tankless problem that Kit has been describing. The warriors<br/>
<br/>
we used to group with all parked it seems and started up casters. Our <br/>
typical crew now is a monk, a cleric, a druid, a mage, and me. Open slots we<br/>
<br/>
fill with a wiz, shaman, or druid depending on who&#39;s paying what and when. <br/>
So many time we are stuck for a real tank. So I do the tank bard thing <br/>
mostly, except no pulling casters won&#39;t give up clarity usually &lt;g&gt;. But the<br/>
<br/>
higher level you get the more a group needs the damage sink that only a real<br/>
<br/>
tank can provide, not to mention taunting. A group that doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
foresight to foster melee classes will find later that they are sunk. We <br/>
routinely foster a friend of ours who plays a tank even though his play time<br/>
<br/>
is less than ours and he is over 10 levels lower. Managing involuntary <br/>
taunting is one of the biggest challenges we have without a real tank, since<br/>
<br/>
we need to be able to pass mobs between me and the monk and keep them off <br/>
the casters. I still die, the monk FD&#39;s, and the casters gate (if they do <br/>
what they are told that is.) It&#39;s oddly fun to screech a train off your <br/>
dying group and &quot;ok get out guys before they come back and finish me, Ill <br/>
try to make it as far as I can when you are all safe.&quot; We don&#39;t take <br/>
anyone&#39;s death as a given because we all are very close friends, some even <br/>
in RL. Besides, clarity addiction is an awful thing, if I&#39;m dead I am one of<br/>
<br/>
the first to get rez&#39;ed in. Clarity is a boring song but it really makes you<br/>
<br/>
the darling of the caster set. Kit, your casters ought to be looking far <br/>
enough ahead to see that leveling you is a real benefit for them. My crew <br/>
has a good bard education and asks &#39;When will we get this or that song?&#39; or <br/>
&#39;what do we get this level?&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
When you start out, most classes are pretty equal. As you level up the game <br/>
changes, and the classes themselves diverge more and more. My cleric will <br/>
fire up my account and run both our characters rather than tank things <br/>
himself unless they are way green. Before 30 he could tank some, now his <br/>
tanking ability is pretty limited and it&#39;s not due to letting any skills go.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t recall what we did before L25 now, I do recall at 25 we started a <br/>
camping campaign to get the 6 paladins in the guild at the time GBs. This <br/>
was rockin exp for a full group into the 30s. If we weren&#39;t actively camping<br/>
<br/>
the lord, we sat next door and killed frogs anyway. You do need to learn UG <br/>
very well before becoming KOS but other than the named frogs, UG is pretty <br/>
underhunted and is very big.<br/>
<br/>
I love barding, and I tried about every class in beta. I have always had the<br/>
<br/>
most fun being a bard. Gediprime described it best the other day, talking <br/>
about invising into the castle in MM to loot a gypsy lute and a WW talon, <br/>
then making a full speed run to the zone when invis flashed off while <br/>
looting, &quot;What a rush!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there Kit.<br/>
