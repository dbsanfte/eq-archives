<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-409103761">I myself run multiple computers through a single DSL connection and single <br/>
IP address. I used to run Sygate as my gateway/firewall, but I had that <br/>
setup on an extra machine with 2 network cards.<br/>
<br/>
I have since gotten a Linksys DSL/Ethernet router which allows me to have 4 <br/>
computers all networked together, using the single IP address for internet <br/>
access. It also acts as a firewall, so you don&#39;t need to install software <br/>
on your computer.<br/>
