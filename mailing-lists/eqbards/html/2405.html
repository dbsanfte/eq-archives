&gt; I was wondering why this skill wasn&#39;t listed at the other trainers. I<br/>
&gt; finally asked a fellow bard about it and he told me you have <br/>
&gt; to train it<br/>
&gt; with Caskin Marseheart upstairs in the Freeport&#39;s Bard Guild.<br/>
&gt; Well I went to him and it still wasnt there. Am I dense or <br/>
&gt; something and<br/>
&gt; skip by it in the list? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What level are you?  I assume since you are talking about the mana song, you<br/>
are level 32+.  All i was thinking was that you are not level 26 yet, when i<br/>
believe it shows up as a skill on Carskin.  Or perhaps they made it<br/>
available at a later level, hard to explain.<br/>

&gt; On another subject, I&#39;m wondering what the best strategy for using the<br/>
&gt; mana song is.<br/>
&gt; Should I even play it at all during combat? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a bug that a spell cast while you are playing the mana song can use<br/>
a whole lot more mana than usual (one whole bubble of mana on a spell that<br/>
normally takes one quarter or less).  Therefore it is not a good idea to<br/>
play the mana song during combat, unless the special case you mentioned when<br/>
all casters are OOM.  otherwise during combat it can actually be<br/>
detrimental.<br/>
<br/>
as far as the decision to play heal or mana song, i find the same thing,<br/>
that everyone wants the mana song instead of heal, because your healer&#39;s<br/>
meditate combined with the mana song allows them to heal the group faster<br/>
than your healing song.  if you are in a group with no healers, you got<br/>
bigger problems hehe.  and as far as entering a fight without everyone being<br/>
full health, i think this is a group decision problem, not because you<br/>
happen to be singing mana instead of heal.  while i do think it is more<br/>
important for all your casters to be FM than the group being full health,<br/>
its just smart to have both.<br/>
<br/>
i think shoulda read this i doubt i made any sense =P<br/>
