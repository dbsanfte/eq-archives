<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858458547">I&#39;ve got 2 questions about Crowd control and lament pulling. <br/>
<br/>
On crowd control, how do you get a group to let you do it?  Every time<br/>
I try charm, mez or selective fear someone (often more than one) freaks<br/>
out.  Last time I dared use charm (to pull a stoneleer off our<br/>
enchanter, help healer, add damage, list goes on) the monk in the party<br/>
took my head off for the audacity of not letting him tank 3 mobs at<br/>
once.  Is it just me falling into groups who refuse to try new things<br/>
or what?  I miss HK when people would be yelling at me if I didn&#39;t<br/>
charm/mez fast enough.  Tho, I&#39;ve noticed Pixie Strike having it&#39;s mez<br/>
portion resisted 7/10 times on any blue con mob or above, only slightly<br/>
better with instrument.  Is this a function of my cha (136) or do the<br/>
rumors I hear of it sucking soon after you get it ring true?  It&#39;s<br/>
scary that Solon&#39;s is more reliable than Pixie.<br/>
<br/>
And on Lament, using it at all.  It worked nicely when I first got it<br/>
and I loved it for a long time but haven&#39;t used it since the early<br/>
twenties.  Every time I tried to use it I got a resist and the mob<br/>
(plus friends) aggroed on me and ground me into bardpaste.  Even with<br/>
lute it&#39;s dangerous at best.  I&#39;d like any advice you folks have on<br/>
it&#39;s proper uses.<br/>
