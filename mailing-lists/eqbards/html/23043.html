&gt; BTW there is a spot in Overthere next to SF were the pathing <br/>
&gt; is totally screwed<br/>
&gt; up. We were fear kiting by there and the mobs just ran in to <br/>
&gt; the wall. Kept fear<br/>
&gt; up and killed them. Should I bug that or leave it to bad <br/>
&gt; pathing? Reason I ask<br/>
&gt; is I don&#39;t want to get in trouble for a bug exploit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a guide sees you doing this you will get a warning and possibly worse.  I<br/>
would suggest not doing it again as it is an exploit to get creatures stuck<br/>
in the world geometry then kill them with no risk.<br/>
