&gt;   This is because people are idiots.  In general, you can assume that<br/>
&gt;   the other 5 people you are playing with know nothing about their own<br/>
&gt;   skills let alone your skills.  Last night in a group with an enchanter,<br/>
&gt;   two bards, a druid and me (a druid).  I got to see the other side of<br/>
&gt;   the fence.  Enchanters have it rough, they are the groups master control<br/>
&gt;   center.  They and the cleric control the groups movement, battle<br/>
&gt;   actions, plans, etc.  The two bards would not assist each other and<br/>
&gt;   insisted on fighting multiple enemies during the same encounter.<br/>

the group, so whatever crowd control we had fell to me.  We had to handle multiple MOBs several times<br/>
(four at once a couple of times, seven in succession a couple of times) and we did rather well, but we<br/>
could have done better.  How?  If the other players had LISTENED TO ME WHEN I SAID TO TARGET ONE MOB OR TO<br/>
/ASSIST XYZ.  (sorry about the caps, Harm).  They didn&#39;t, probably because I&#39;m just too gosh-darned polite<br/>
about it.  If I had been dying as a result of this, I would have started to yell, myself.  If people<br/>
continue to be clueless despite repeated polite nudgings, you have to HIT THEM ON THE HEAD.<br/>
