<div id="ygrps-yiv-158855163">You forget that you are in Verant&#39;s world now.  The mino horn is a wind<br/>
instrument, not a brass instrument like other typical horns.  Of course<br/>
we&#39;re also talking about a piece of bone that used to stick out of a<br/>
minotaur&#39;s head.  I never understood how it could be considered an<br/>
instrument in the first place seeing that most animal horns are solid mass.<br/>

Isn&#39;t a mino horn a brass instrument?  I saw a bard in my group using a horn<br/>
last night with pixie strike (I play a chanter now).  Am I missing<br/>
something?  Isn&#39;t pixie strike a wind song?  When I used to use it, I used<br/>
my flute until I got a piccolo off that big ugly rockhead in Fear.<br/>
