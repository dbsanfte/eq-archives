the buildings close to the docks.  People who are KOS to him<br/>
wait for the boat at the docks sometimes end up getting within<br/>
his aggro radius through the wall.  He then runs out the<br/>
building, through the streets, and to the docks to attack that<br/>
person.  If that person manages to get on the boat, he will<br/>
swim after them.<br/>

I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to kill him.  The weapon you get<br/>
is not really that good, and the faction hit is substantial.  <br/>
Repairing your faction with the merchants of Qeynos is easy<br/>
enough (visit Blackburrow).  But everything I&#39;ve found that<br/>
raises your faction with the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos also<br/>
lowers it with the non-corrupt guards.<br/>
