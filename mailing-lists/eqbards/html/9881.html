<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511382176">I have become quite fond of being in groups that are willing to turn off<br/>
autosplit and go FFA on all non-rare spawns, then roll a random magical die<br/>
for 1-100 (/random 100) for who gets the rare item should the rare mob drop<br/>
it - highest roll takes the booty.  This may only work well at higher levels<br/>
where money is not *such* of an issue to people and of course, the group has<br/>
to be cool people that are not selfish or greedy.  <br/>
<br/>
I encourage this method, especially when I am the group leader.  Oh, and<br/>
another bonus is that with split off you don&#39;t get as many of those pesky<br/>
coppers and silvers to weigh you down like you do when split is on.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts for you on alternative methods...<br/>

&gt;   Money IS a real problem !! I am being driven NUTS by groups <br/>
&gt; declaring<br/>
&gt; they will loot &quot;Alpha 4P or FS, autosplit OFF&quot;... Then watch while the<br/>
&gt; looter carefully avoids looting anything with a weapon till last and<br/>
&gt; then they declare &quot;Nuts, all silver and a rusty&quot; :(   ...of course an<br/>
&gt; hour later your up for loot and the leader (Named Alphonse of course)<br/>
&gt; declares &quot;I gotta go guys, great playing with you&quot; and disbands the<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
&gt;   Now I don&#39;t want to be a spoil sport but central loot collection and<br/>
&gt; no split schemes seem to me to have too many bugs to allow to <br/>
&gt; be used in<br/>
&gt; groups I am in. If you need money my opinion is &quot;Alpha auto on&quot; is the<br/>
&gt; only way to go !!<br/>

&gt; PS. I am in debt to a guild member up to 150p. Guilds help but this is<br/>
&gt; &quot;business&quot; not family :)<br/>
&gt;     Any great money making schemes appreciated :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The gems for these pieces plus guantlets<br/>
&gt; &gt; has cost me 1000pp. Then it was time to kill more HG&#39;s for <br/>
&gt; money as well as<br/>
&gt; &gt; lambents, I was down to only a few gold in the bank! This <br/>
&gt; leaves no room to<br/>
&gt; &gt; pay for the lambent. Being guilded really helps though, <br/>
&gt; just put out the<br/>
&gt; &gt; call for an HG expedition and I had a mid 30s to 40s crew in route<br/>
&gt; &gt; immediately for a profitable night.<br/>
