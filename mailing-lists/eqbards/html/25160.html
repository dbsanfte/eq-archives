<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874819651">There is definitely a positive aspect to it - this is a really nice feature<br/>
for people who can really use it.  It&#39;s just too bad that there&#39;s no doubt<br/>
it will be abused.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it&#39;s good that they are stripping items and cash on a server<br/>
move - it could cause a serious problem on a newer server (especially if a<br/>
large group moves) and more importantly - will prevent &quot;K3w1 d00dz&quot;) from<br/>
moving without impunity to another server where their bad rep won&#39;t follow<br/>
them).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I personally I think the rates are a tad high - $300 - (3 or move<br/>
cross server) is not an insignificant amount of money...<br/>

Well, here&#39;s the other perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I play EQ. My GF saw, wondered why I was on the game for hours, and now<br/>
plays EQ as well.<br/>
<br/>
We have two computers, (Now), and I would be REALLY glad to get her off<br/>
mine. I even already bought her<br/>
new accounts that I would PL her on. Now I don&#39;t have to PL her at all, she<br/>
can just get transferred.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think $50 is no big deal to be able to get my account all to<br/>
myself and not have to share<br/>
computer time on EQ...<br/>

&gt; You&#39;ll split the chars off to a new account and then sell it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Long term - this isn&#39;t necessarily an e-bay issue - but short term it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; huge one.  Every person with a reasonably (to very) high level character<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t use any more will be tempted to split them off and sell them.<br/>

&gt; &quot;This should be rather interesting.  Power level a char up on a secondary<br/>
&gt; account, transfer to a friend that is too slow leveling or something...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cant transfer between accounts that are owned by different people (IE<br/>
&gt; different billing info including credit card.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Wonder how big an impact this will be to the community.  Hmm have a friend<br/>
&gt; who quit and doesnt have the heart to start over, no problem, transfer him<br/>
&gt; one of your old characters...<br/>
