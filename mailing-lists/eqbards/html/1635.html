<b>Author:</b> Mott, Mike J. <br/>
<b>Subject:</b> Invisibility Song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205074082">I did some experimentation with invisibility last night at the big monolith<br/>
on the shore in North Karana.  It seems that with the song, I am also<br/>
invisible to undead ( zombies and skellies).  Of course if you have an<br/>
unlucky moment and become visible, then they all attack.<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading that invisibility did not work for undead.  Was this only<br/>
for the mana user&#39;s version, or do higher lvl undead&#39;s see right through it?<br/>

	I&#39;m not encouraging anyone to train SGs or other high lvl mobs on<br/>
ppl<br/>
	(even if they are jerks), but Verant will not ban you. They may<br/>
claim<br/>
	to, just to scare ppl, but when it comes down to it, money talks -<br/>
	bullshit walks.<br/>
	Any of you on Tarew Marr may be familiar with a player named<br/>
	Neuromancer. Well, he&#39;s very famous for training SGs and such on<br/>
ppl,<br/>
	just for the sake of being an asshole. Several members of my guild<br/>
have<br/>
	encountered him and after he tried training stuff on them, they all<br/>
	petitioned. He seems to train stuff on everyone he meets. He<br/>
attempted<br/>
	it once on me while I was hunting orcs in Oasis. I petitioned him as<br/>
	well. By this time he must have a good 3 dozen petitions on his<br/>
name. He<br/>
	did receive a so-called warning once, but thats where it ends.<br/>
	I&#39;ve lost faith in Verant&#39;s ability to keep the game clean and fun<br/>
for<br/>
	ALL players. They seem to care more about the $10 a month than the<br/>
	individuals that actually play the game.<br/>
	Friends who have lost all their posessions due to corpse bugs come<br/>
to<br/>
	mind. The GMs basically tell you &quot;sucks to be you&quot; and ignore you.<br/>
	Does anyone know of anyone who has actually been banned?<br/>
	I know a few ppl on Tarew Marr were banned for exploiting &quot;safe<br/>
areas&quot;<br/>
	in beta, but thats it.<br/>
	In my opinion, deliberately ruining other ppls fun is much worse<br/>
than<br/>
	exploiting power-leveling tactics. But oh well, what can ya do?<br/>

	Subject: Denons Discord and More<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Last night I duelled a friend and did some research on this.<br/>
<br/>
	Background:<br/>
<br/>
	Jyzan - level 24 bard<br/>
	Str 104<br/>
	Dex 107<br/>
	Cha 76   (I&#39;m wearing a grotesque mask)<br/>
<br/>
	Singing:  125<br/>
	Brass: 76<br/>
	String: 125<br/>
<br/>
	When singing Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord, it was doing 9 damage per<br/>
tick.  Chords<br/>
	of Dissonance was doing 7.  Denon&#39;s also decreased the target&#39;s AC<br/>
by 9, which<br/>
	is very good.<br/>
<br/>
	When playing their respective instruments, Denon&#39;s was going 19<br/>
damage per tick,<br/>
	while Chords was doing something like 15.  Denon&#39;s was also<br/>
decreasing AC by 19,<br/>
	which is a LOT.  This is MORE than taking off a steel breastplate<br/>
and going<br/>
	barechested.<br/>
<br/>
	Keep in mind that these songs are &quot;damage over time&quot; songs, so that<br/>
once you<br/>
	make them &quot;wince&quot; once, it will damage them 2 more times, so if I<br/>
were to juggle<br/>
	these two songs and Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow, here are the effects I<br/>
would have:<br/>
<br/>
	Tick 1:  Denon&#39;s makes them wince for 9, and reduces their AC by 9<br/>
	Tick 2:  Chords for 7, Denon for 9, AC still reduced<br/>
	Tick 3:  Bellow for 13, Chords for 7, Denon for 9, AC still reduced.<br/>
<br/>
	The net result of all this:  54 damage, AC reduced by 9.<br/>
<br/>
	Compare this to most people&#39;s tactics, which is Bellowing all three<br/>
rounds, for<br/>
	a net damage of 39 and no AC reduction.  Over a long fight, this is<br/>
a<br/>
	significant difference.<br/>
<br/>
	One other thing that we tested... Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding, in<br/>
addition to<br/>
	reducing attack speeds, lowered AC by 6.<br/>
<br/>
	Jyzan<br/>

<br/>
	only benefit of bellow over denon&#39;s and chords is that it is a<br/>
single target<br/>
	song instead of area effect, which in many cases outweighs the extra<br/>
damage.<br/>
	area effects are very dangerous in dungeons.<br/>

	If a usually evil race looks indifferent at you, I would suggest not<br/>
<br/>
	attacking it.  I learned the hard way about Grunrich, and ran to<br/>
	the guards with him chasing me.  The guards killed me instead :)<br/>

	Subject: Weaknesses to invisibility song<br/>
<br/>
	Couple things I&#39;ve learned about the invisibility song.<br/>
<br/>
	1) The effect does not &quot;linger&quot; if your party members move out<br/>
	of range like other bard songs do.  When they move out of<br/>
	range, they immediately blink into sight.  This seriously<br/>
	decreases its usefulness for group movement and corpse<br/>
	recovery.<br/>
<br/>
	2) If one of your party members blinks into sight and is<br/>
	attacked, then moves back into the song&#39;s influence, the next<br/>
	song tick the mobs will start attacking you even though you<br/>
	are still invisible.  Your song helped someone being attacked,<br/>
	so they will now attack you, invisibile or not.<br/>
<br/>
	3) My friends were telling me that the song was canceling<br/>
	their invisibility to undead.<br/>
<br/>
	In short, the song is probably only useful in solo play, and<br/>
	if your group is not moving.  Disappointing to say the least.<br/>
	Anyone know if it&#39;s intended to be this way?  Perhaps we could<br/>
	petition to get (1) fixed.  The effect does &quot;linger&quot; with you<br/>
	for two ticks if you stop singing.<br/>

	Subject: battle drum?<br/>
<br/>
	i was wondering if any of our 30+ bards on this list has gotten to<br/>
use this <br/>
	item.  it comes from a 30+ named gypsy musician in mistmoore.  I<br/>
asked a <br/>
	person that killed the musician if it was a lore item or magical or <br/>
	anything, but as far as he could tell, it was neither.  it has the<br/>
same wt <br/>
	0.5 as a regular drum, so I am curious to know if it improves songs<br/>
any when <br/>
	used with songs.  Since it was off a named mob, the guy did not want<br/>
to sell <br/>
	it to me just yet, because no one knew the worth.  anyone know about<br/>
this?<br/>

	Subject: Galtin&#39;s misadventure + some questions about corpses in the<br/>
ocean<br/>
<br/>
	Last night while waiting for the boat on the Butcherblock dock I<br/>
volunteered<br/>
	to assist another player locate his corpse.  He said that he crashed<br/>
while<br/>
	riding the boat and that when he logged back on he started out at<br/>
the bottom<br/>
	of the ocean.  He eventually ran out of stamina and died.  He also<br/>
stated<br/>
	that his corpse was somewhere in the ocean in the Butcherblock zone.<br/>
I<br/>
	started singing the locating song and immediately got a bearing on<br/>
his<br/>
	corpse.  I told him to follow me and I jumped into the ocean.  I<br/>
continued<br/>
	swimming along the bearing until I ran into the zone barrier.  I was<br/>
	underwater at the time I ran into the zone barrier.  His corpse was<br/>
nowhere<br/>
	in sight. At this point, I apparently encountered a bug because I<br/>
could no<br/>
	longer swim in any direction.  It was like I was stuck to the zone<br/>
barrier.<br/>
	I still had plenty of air left but all attempts at breaking away<br/>
from the<br/>
	zone were unsuccessful. I tried every arrow key, the PageUp key, and<br/>
	PageDown key.  Nothing.  I eventually drowned myself.  <br/>
<br/>
	When I died, I got the overhead view of my corpse.  The funny thing<br/>
is that<br/>
	there was someone (in full armor) walking around the bottom of the<br/>
ocean<br/>
	next to my corpse.  The person had two names but I couldn&#39;t tell if<br/>
it was a<br/>
	player or a NPC. It looked like a human and I know for certain it<br/>
wasn&#39;t a<br/>
	dwarven guard.  I know bards have an underwater breathing song<br/>
	(unfortunately for me I&#39;m not high enough yet to sing it) but does<br/>
the song<br/>
	allow you to walk on the bottom of the ocean?  Do other classes have<br/>
spells<br/>
	that allow them to breathe underwater?<br/>
<br/>
	Now my character is back in Freeport and will have to ride the boat<br/>
back to<br/>
	retrieve his corpse.  Adding insult to injury, I won&#39;t have time to<br/>
retrieve<br/>
	my corpse before the boat leaves Butcherblock so I will have to wait<br/>
until<br/>
	it makes the round trip back from Freeport.  Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
	Here is what I would like to know:<br/>
<br/>
	1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was supposed<br/>
to<br/>
	happen?  <br/>
	2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck<br/>
again if I<br/>
	try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to<br/>
pull my<br/>
	corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
	3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s<br/>
corpse?  My<br/>
	theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but in<br/>
the Ocean<br/>
	of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the<br/>
right<br/>
	direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you are<br/>
looking<br/>
	for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of Tears<br/>
zone<br/>
	then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse was<br/>
in the<br/>
	Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.  <br/>
	4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on<br/>
the<br/>
	bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
	5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to<br/>
/petition.<br/>
	Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>
	retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I<br/>
sure<br/>
	hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>
retrieve it.<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks ahead of time for any replies.<br/>

<br/>
	In my experience if you target a player with no corpse in the zone,<br/>
you<br/>
	get the same message saying that you sense a corpse in this<br/>
direction,<br/>
	but it does not actually turn you in any direction. Maybe you were<br/>
	already pointing in that direction, and just though it was pulling<br/>
you?<br/>
<br/>
	They should really fix this to have the song end if there is no<br/>
corpse<br/>
	in the zone.<br/>

<br/>
	Ouch, this certainly seems like a sticky situation...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; 1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was<br/>
supposed to<br/>
	&gt; happen?<br/>
<br/>
	No, that&#39;s definately a bug.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; 2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck<br/>
again if I<br/>
	&gt; try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to<br/>
pull my<br/>
	&gt; corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
<br/>
	You should be able to, but you have to be pretty close for this to<br/>
work.  You<br/>
	will likely have to swim to the bottom for it to work.<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; 3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s<br/>
corpse?  My<br/>
	&gt; theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but in<br/>
the Ocean<br/>
	&gt; of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the<br/>
right<br/>
	&gt; direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you<br/>
are looking<br/>
	&gt; for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of<br/>
Tears zone<br/>
	&gt; then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse<br/>
was in the<br/>
	&gt; Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.<br/>
<br/>
	If the corpse was in the ocean of tears, your song would not have<br/>
located it, so<br/>
	the corpse is in the BB zone, but it sounds like it wasn&#39;t in the<br/>
correct zone<br/>
	space.  This bug happened to a friend of mine once when he died due<br/>
to a weird<br/>
	treeform bug.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; 4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking<br/>
on the<br/>
	&gt; bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
<br/>
	That is really odd, since players do a swim animation when they are<br/>
underwater.<br/>
	It could have been an NPC, or perhaps a GM, but they swim when they<br/>
are<br/>
	underwater as well as far as I know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; 5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to<br/>
/petition.<br/>
	&gt; Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they<br/>
automatically<br/>
	&gt; retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?<br/>
I sure<br/>
	&gt; hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>
retrieve it.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	GMs make no promises in this regard, but given the circumstances of<br/>
your death<br/>
	(including the bug involved) if you are patient a GM will likely<br/>
help you.  They<br/>
	may not though.<br/>
<br/>
	Good luck,<br/>

	&gt;<br/>
	&gt;1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was<br/>

<br/>
	That sounds like a bug.  Everyone else I&#39;ve heard has told me that<br/>
it<br/>
	simply stops you.<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck<br/>
again if I<br/>
	&gt;try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to<br/>
pull my<br/>
	&gt;corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
<br/>
	You should be able to /corpse it from anywhere.  I&#39;ve even heard<br/>
that now<br/>
	you can /corpse out of Lava (perhaps they increased the /corpse<br/>
range).<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s<br/>
corpse?  My<br/>
	&gt;theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but in<br/>

zone<br/>
	&gt;then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse was<br/>
in the<br/>
	&gt;Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.  <br/>
<br/>
	MAJOR bug there.  Unless his corpse was beneath the world - in which<br/>
case,<br/>
	it DID lead you to him. Only his body was a million miles under you.<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on<br/>
the<br/>
	&gt;bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
<br/>
	Most likely an NPC, actually - probably one who was lost.  Possibly<br/>
a Bard<br/>
	with Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, but you&#39;d have to ask around.  FYI in<br/>
weird<br/>
	situations, don&#39;t be afraid to hammer on the &quot;Screenshot&quot; key a few<br/>
times.<br/>
	It&#39;s amazing what details you missed that you can locate later from<br/>
a<br/>
	screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to<br/>
/petition.<br/>
	&gt;Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they<br/>

I sure<br/>
	&gt;hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>
retrieve it.<br/>
<br/>
	They will certainly retrieve his - but what I would do is petition a<br/>
GM<br/>
	with the initial problem, and then offer to attempt the retrieval on<br/>
your<br/>
	own, if they will watch to make sure that you do not get trapped<br/>
again.  It<br/>
	DOES seem to be a bug, but it&#39;s not verifiable (like a corpse under<br/>
the<br/>
	world is) so they will be hard pressed to prove it, and the hard<br/>
rule is<br/>
	&quot;If you cannot prove it was a bug, you cannot help them.&quot;  You can<br/>
mention<br/>
	to them that the reason you want them to &quot;watch over you&quot; is because<br/>
the<br/>
	bug will likely cause you to die before you can /corpse your body.<br/>
<br/>
	Oh - and have you thought about using the jig o&#39; vigor to restore<br/>
your lost<br/>
	stamina?  I never thought about it before...<br/>

	I have had this happen to me before.  Just petition next time you<br/>
are in game and a<br/>
	guide will bring your corpse to you.  Do not try and recover it<br/>
again because it is<br/>
	impossible to do so, at least as far as I have seen.  make your<br/>
petition something<br/>
	like /petition I tried to help another player in OOT and ended up<br/>
stuck in a patch<br/>
	of water and drowned.  Mine was something of the sort and they just<br/>
told me hang on<br/>
	and I appeared on an island in OOT and there was my corpse on the<br/>

	&gt; &gt; then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse<br/>
was in the<br/>
	&gt; &gt; Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more<br/>
puzzling.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; If the corpse was in the ocean of tears, your song would not have<br/>
located it, so<br/>
	&gt; the corpse is in the BB zone, but it sounds like it wasn&#39;t in the<br/>
correct zone<br/>
	&gt; space.  This bug happened to a friend of mine once when he died<br/>
due to a weird<br/>
	&gt; treeform bug.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt; 4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking<br/>
on the<br/>
	&gt; &gt; bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; That is really odd, since players do a swim animation when they<br/>
are underwater.<br/>
	&gt; It could have been an NPC, or perhaps a GM, but they swim when<br/>
they are<br/>
	&gt; underwater as well as far as I know.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt; 5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to<br/>
/petition.<br/>
	&gt; &gt; Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they<br/>
automatically<br/>
	&gt; &gt; retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the<br/>
ocean?  I sure<br/>
	&gt; &gt; hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>
retrieve it.<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; GMs make no promises in this regard, but given the circumstances<br/>
of your death<br/>
	&gt; (including the bug involved) if you are patient a GM will likely<br/>
help you.  They<br/>
	&gt; may not though.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; Good luck,<br/>

	&gt; FYI in weird situations, don&#39;t be afraid to hammer on the<br/>
&quot;Screenshot&quot; key<br/>
	&gt; a few times.<br/>
	&gt; It&#39;s amazing what details you missed that you can locate later<br/>
from a<br/>
	&gt; screenshot.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
		How do you take a screenshot?  Do you just hit the PrtScn<br/>
button or<br/>
	is there another button to push?<br/>
<br/>
	&gt; Oh - and have you thought about using the jig o&#39; vigor to restore<br/>
your<br/>
	&gt; lost<br/>
	&gt; stamina?  I never thought about it before...<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
		Running out of stamina wasn&#39;t my problem.  I was stuck<br/>
underwater<br/>
	and ran out of air.  I learned about singing the stamina song while<br/>
swimming<br/>
	a couple of weeks ago.  While on the boat in the OOT my PC locked<br/>
up.  When<br/>
	I logged back on I was at the bottom of the ocean.  After reaching<br/>
the top,<br/>
	I started the song and swam across the entire OOT until I reached<br/>
the last<br/>
	dock before you reach Butcherblock.  Wouldn&#39;t have been able to do<br/>
it unless<br/>
	I had the stamina song.  That&#39;s the only time I have ever had to use<br/>
the<br/>
	stamina song since I&#39;ve been playing the character.  Anyway, it took<br/>
me over<br/>
	45 minutes real time to get to the dock.  Raised my swimming skill<br/>
by 40<br/>
	points during the trip.  That was the only good thing that came out<br/>
of the<br/>
	whole deal.<br/>

	&gt; At 10:00 AM 6/7/99 -1000, you wrote:<br/>
	&gt; &gt;Here is what I would like to know:<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt;1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was<br/>
supposed to<br/>
	&gt; &gt;happen?<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; That sounds like a bug.  Everyone else I&#39;ve heard has told me that<br/>
it<br/>
	&gt; simply stops you.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt;2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get<br/>
	&gt; stuck again if I<br/>
	&gt; &gt;try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to<br/>
pull my<br/>
	&gt; &gt;corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; You should be able to /corpse it from anywhere.  I&#39;ve even heard<br/>
that now<br/>
	&gt; you can /corpse out of Lava (perhaps they increased the /corpse<br/>
range).<br/>
<br/>
	This is probably still only on the test server, like the /follow<br/>
command,<br/>
	and, what I read was that you can&#39;t /corpse from lava, but you can<br/>
/loot.<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt;3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s<br/>
corpse?  My<br/>
	&gt; &gt;theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but<br/>
	&gt; in the Ocean<br/>
	&gt; &gt;of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in<br/>
the right<br/>
	&gt; &gt;direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you<br/>
	&gt; are looking<br/>
	&gt; &gt;for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of<br/>
Tears zone<br/>
	&gt; &gt;then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse<br/>
	&gt; was in the<br/>
	&gt; &gt;Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; MAJOR bug there.  Unless his corpse was beneath the world - in<br/>
which case,<br/>
	&gt; it DID lead you to him. Only his body was a million miles under<br/>
you.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	IF his corpse was in the OOT zone, then you should have received a<br/>
message<br/>
	like:<br/>
	&quot;There is no corpse by that identification in this zone&quot; or similar.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
	gotten<br/>
	that a few times, when a player has a) lost a corpse or b) was just<br/>
confused<br/>
	about<br/>
	which zone they actually died in.<br/>
<br/>
	&gt; &gt;4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking<br/>
on the<br/>
	&gt; &gt;bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; Most likely an NPC, actually - probably one who was lost.<br/>
Possibly a Bard<br/>
	&gt; with Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, but you&#39;d have to ask around.  FYI in<br/>
weird<br/>
	&gt; situations, don&#39;t be afraid to hammer on the &quot;Screenshot&quot; key a<br/>
few times.<br/>
	&gt; It&#39;s amazing what details you missed that you can locate later<br/>
from a<br/>
	&gt; screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
	Some NPC&#39;s don&#39;t seem to have a &#39;swimming&#39; animation.  Once, at the<br/>
docks in<br/>
	Freeport, I was swimming around, and the girl that normally stands<br/>
on the<br/>
	end of<br/>
	the dock was down on the ocean floor, still fishing.  So this could<br/>
have<br/>
	been an NPC<br/>
	that wandered off the beaten path.  I&#39;m not real familiar with the<br/>
BB zone,<br/>
	but I<br/>
	don&#39;t remember any wandering human or elf NPC&#39;s, at least not near<br/>
the<br/>
	docks.  There<br/>
	are some elves there at the docks though they don&#39;t seem to walk<br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt;5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to<br/>
/petition.<br/>
	&gt; &gt;Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they<br/>
automatically<br/>
	&gt; &gt;retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?<br/>
I sure<br/>
	&gt; &gt;hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>
	&gt; retrieve it.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; They will certainly retrieve his - but what I would do is petition<br/>
a GM<br/>
	&gt; with the initial problem, and then offer to attempt the retrieval<br/>
on your<br/>
	&gt; own, if they will watch to make sure that you do not get trapped<br/>
	&gt; again.  It<br/>
	&gt; DOES seem to be a bug, but it&#39;s not verifiable (like a corpse<br/>
under the<br/>
	&gt; world is) so they will be hard pressed to prove it, and the hard<br/>
rule is<br/>
	&gt; &quot;If you cannot prove it was a bug, you cannot help them.&quot;  You can<br/>
mention<br/>
	&gt; to them that the reason you want them to &quot;watch over you&quot; is<br/>
because the<br/>
	&gt; bug will likely cause you to die before you can /corpse your body.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; Oh - and have you thought about using the jig o&#39; vigor to restore<br/>
	&gt; your lost<br/>
	&gt; stamina?  I never thought about it before...<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	Heh...I crashed in the OOT zone, once.  My ISP dropped out from<br/>
under me,<br/>
	and<br/>
	when I finally got back in, I was at the ocean floor.  I swam over<br/>
	hmm...half the<br/>
	zone (I was halfway between the two dock islands).  I kept the jig<br/>
going the<br/>
	entire time, and never once did my stamina bar drop.  And, my<br/>
swimming skill<br/>
	went<br/>
	from nearly nothing (5 or 6) to about 35 during that swim.  Pretty<br/>
boring,<br/>
	actually.<br/>
<br/>
