classes than the Lullaby to ours.  Granted I was lower-level at the time and<br/>
had less options; but  I recall (pre-nerf) lullaby being one of the main<br/>
songs on my mem list.  I often even had it memmed when grouped with<br/>
enchanters in case we got hit by a train while they were OOM (again this is<br/>
pre-clarity days).  Saved the groups ass so many times in the Permafrost<br/>
Flag room - I lost count.  Now it&#39;s useless.<br/>

Perhaps squeaky wheel does work and we should raise a stink...<br/>
