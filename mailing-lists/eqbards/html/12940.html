&gt; I got some decent exp in Sol B Saturday and Sunday (6<br/>

&gt; How?  If the other players had LISTENED TO ME WHEN I SAID<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had the chance to be in some wonderful guild and mixed<br/>
groups lately.  Last night in Mistmoore, we had 8 people<br/>
L30-44.  3 bards, ranger, 2 pallies, warrior, and enchanter<br/>
(yeah, no real healer).  Everyone assisted, I did my best to<br/>
break up the spawn and keep the others updated on what to<br/>
expect (I was pulling).  They did their best to keep me<br/>
updated on their mana status.<br/>
<br/>
The monster pull of the night was the first one to break the<br/>
spawn.  I&#39;d lulled as much as I could but couldn&#39;t guarantee<br/>
what wouldn&#39;t come.  IIRC the pull ended up being the<br/>
negotiator, pet, ambassador, shadowy scrivener, pet, another<br/>
caster I don&#39;t recall, will pillager, 2 flouting gargs, 1<br/>
leering garg, 2 deathly ushers, and 1 deathly harbringer.  On<br/>
top of that, another scrivener spawned in the room during the<br/>
fight.  12 vs 8, 14 vs 8 if you count the pets.<br/>
<br/>
We won, handily.  Both paladins were OOM with 1 LH used, the<br/>
enchanter was down to about 15%, and I had to switch to a lute<br/>
to heal in the middle of the fight (6 people wounded * 17<br/>
points * 3 pulses healed per application, all but one mob<br/>
mezed, heck yeah I&#39;m going to heal).  But everyone attacked<br/>
the same mob, quickly switched to help out the enchanter when<br/>
she was under attack (leaving the mob we had been fighting),<br/>
and if they weren&#39;t badly wounded pulled stuff that resisted<br/>
mesmerize off those who were wounded.  Except for the LH,<br/>
nobody dropped much below 2 bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
After that, it was easy nonstop action and experience.  The<br/>
pace was so fast I made the ranger take over pulling so I<br/>
would have enough *time* to loot the corpses and divide the<br/>
spoils.  Unless you&#39;re killling really easy stuff, if people<br/>
won&#39;t listen to you when tell them to /assist, leave the<br/>
group.<br/>
