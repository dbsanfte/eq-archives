<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-98076681">Just a question out of the blue, I was not going to /movelog but i found out<br/>
at the last minute that my friends changed their minds and are going to, so<br/>
i did a /movelog yes this morning.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of experience if they move all the move requests?  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to be left behind.<br/>
<br/>
And anyone else moving to the new server from sol ro, Karana and CT?<br/>
<br/>
I tried calling the station but of course their pacific time and dont open<br/>
for a couple hours.<br/>
