&gt; Whoops, when last I heard the word on how these things worked (some time<br/>

(mace) in your primary hand and a fast weapon (dagger) in your<br/>
secondary hand, eventually you will get the series of<br/>

You crush...<br/>
You pierce...<br/>
You pierce...<br/>
You crush...<br/>

That combination is impossible if dual wield were based on<br/>
your primary weapon speed.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, it&#39;d be really really stupid if Verant coded it based<br/>
on primary weapon.  If that were so, you could put a mithril<br/>
quill (4/16) in your primary and a glowing pike (9/36) in your<br/>
secondary, and your secondary would act like a 9/16 weapon.<br/>
