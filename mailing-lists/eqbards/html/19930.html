<div id="ygrps-yiv-515002557">Verant is capable of creating high level character.<br/>
<br/>
Guildmates of mine were in the Kunark beta (several of them.<br/>
Enough to notice they were gone off of the production server)<br/>
Verant would buff them up to a required level, and then take them<br/>
to fight specific things. It wasn&#39;t all just random go anywhere,<br/>
do anything type stuff. At the end, they got buffed up to 60 to<br/>
do some of the highest stuff -- and there are pictures of some of that<br/>
that was out before Kunark actually came out. <br/>
<br/>
I am sure they are capable of buffing up the people on Test actually<br/>
doing TESTING for them to levels necessary to test the things that <br/>
need testing. <br/>

&gt;	My concern is this: How long will it take players of the less-common<br/>
&gt;classes (in particular Bards and Rogues) get to higher levels to test the<br/>
&gt;songs/skills etc that only come at the high-level.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;	I heard (here?) that Verant&#39;s in-house testing group is <br/>
&gt;four.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Here. And I&#39;d put the status of that at the state of rumor.</div>
