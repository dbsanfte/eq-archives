<div id="ygrps-yiv-593827115">I thought I&#39;d look through the list and see which songs I don&#39;t use.  At<br/>
level 57, these are the ones I haven&#39;t used at all in the last 2<br/>
months.  Maybe somebody has some bright ideas on some of them!<br/>
<br/>
3 - Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39;Vigor:  Cantana does enough.<br/>
6 - Hymn of Restoration:  I can&#39;t figure out what it stacks with.<br/>
7 - Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong:  Later versions are better?<br/>
10 - Anthem de Arms:  VoV better?<br/>
12 - Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow:  Heh<br/>
15 - Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby:  Well, I did mem it to check it out.  Heh<br/>
again.<br/>
20 - Cassindra&#39;s Chant of Clarity:  I&#39;ve got better.<br/>
24 - Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord:  We&#39;ve had this discussion  :)<br/>
28 - Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike:  53 is plenty good enough<br/>
34 - Cantana of Soothing:  I&#39;ve got better.<br/>
35 - Denon&#39;s Dissension:  Now, really, isn&#39;t THIS worthless?<br/>
36 - Vilia&#39;s Verses of Celerity:  I&#39;ve got better.<br/>
42 - McVaxius&#39; Berserker Crescendo:  Someone find a stackable use for<br/>
this?<br/>
50 - Melody of Ervaj:  I&#39;ve never been in a party where this would be<br/>
useful.<br/>
53 - Song of Dawn:  Reducing aggro on secondary MOBs doesn&#39;t help when<br/>
you&#39;re the only one on the list.  Primary MOBs are easy to ditch.  Plus,<br/>
I can just wait for the Cleric to heal me, now.<br/>
56 - Song of Highsun:  Well, I&#39;ve memmed it, but it&#39;s always nighttime.<br/>
56 - Song of Midnight:  Well, I&#39;ve memmed it, but it&#39;s always daytime.<br/>
<br/>
Really, a pretty short list, if you think about it.<br/>
