No I loved my bard and my guild and the game, I just was playing too long<br/>
(2.5 years now) and saw a very short to no future left for me.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
and done just about everything there is to do, and wanted to get back to the<br/>
real world.  So account cancelled, all characters deleted.<br/>

&gt; switch to a<br/>
&gt; different class?  If you switched classes, why did you do it? <br/>
&gt;  I retired my<br/>
&gt; bard at 50 so I&#39;m curious.<br/>
