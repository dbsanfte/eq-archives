<div id="ygrps-yiv-578714710">The chanter/cleric thing.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to run into a *lot* of shaman, and though I&#39;m not doing the post-50<br/>
Kunark dungeons yet .. we are poking about in 30-45 Velious areas.  I came<br/>
back to EQ (had honestly deleted my account AND my Bard when the broken as<br/>
intended statement was made) b/c they helped out our CC songs.  My vision of<br/>
my Bard was a pied piper and singing to reduce down ( not a self-service<br/>
tank). Sooo .. I do CC .. a lot ... and sometimes have done CC even with a<br/>
chanter in group (not going oom has won me that post a few times).  And my<br/>
favorite thing to hear after I join a group is &quot;Pull! Pull faster! Pull<br/>
harder things&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
With someone root parking to help, or a necro assisting, its not hard at<br/>
all.  But, a few of the rooters that play with me before - now happily wait<br/>
with the mob smacking on them for me to mez/charm (whatever I called) so<br/>
they can continue thier heals/burns (why waste mana when mana-less is about<br/>
to do the task?).  And I&#39;m at the level again (finally!) where most groups<br/>
assist.  Yay!  Repeat group-mates are more and more just assuming I&#39;m CC and<br/>
hitting thier rythm fast.   There have been many times we have gone deep<br/>
with neither cleric nor chanter, times we have unexpectedly cleared out<br/>
places considered too risky to try without Cleric and Chanter, and my max<br/>
contolled pull was six so far in tower of frozen.  First pull, pick-up<br/>
group, only five, no chanter, one healer only and a druid (he was good<br/>
tho) - no one died.  A couple of groups have even started calling for<br/>
multi-pulls if the pull distance was long to keep the pace up hehe.   Oh and<br/>
the one pick-up group of five Paladins and a Bard simply couldn&#39;t pull mobs<br/>
fast enough to keep busy lol!.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would suggest is hotkeys with /g says in them on charm & mez and<br/>
when sending a charmed mob after a target.  With pick-up groups getting<br/>
communication in the first few multi-pulls quickly often the margin between<br/>
some deaths as members panic w/o thier chanter& cleric security blanket or<br/>
thier going about business and getting a good flow/assist pattern going.<br/>
I&#39;ve been in groups with cleric and/or chanters that have had deaths b/c<br/>
that flow wasn&#39;t established (early?yet?) sometimes in spots I had soloed.<br/>
<br/>
So I think there is plenty of opportunity to practice this well before 53.<br/>
I&#39;d rather go nasty places with me and two (shaman or druid) and a tank-like<br/>
object and a coordinated group than me and a full group of six with the<br/>
usual cleric/chanter/snarer-evac/burn or BS/main-tank/me and one person who<br/>
panics and poor group coordination.  I think the reason the just mentioned<br/>
&quot;standard&quot; group is so successful (warrior & CHeal aside) is that the roles<br/>
are well practiced and most non-career solo players will know thier part and<br/>
coordinate quickly on the initial breaks/pulls.  The number one line I hear<br/>
when recently dead is &quot;Oh sorry, I didn&#39;t know bards could do that&quot;, number<br/>
two is the afore-mentioned &quot;Wow you die fast!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
