<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834568326">Wow this is great news. I had been ranting about the bard&#39;s AC penalty on our imbrued armor.. didn&#39;t think<br/>
anyone gave half a crap but at least the changes were made.<br/>
I can only bash Verant so much in one day... but why is our stuff suddenly dropping now when they were<br/>
quoted on saying something like &quot;after extensive testing, we&#39;ve determined that imbrued armor is still<br/>
dropping&quot; before the patch. That was posted on EQ Casters I believe after the issue was raised that our<br/>
armor hadn&#39;t been dropping.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you guys out there with full suits of imbrued might tell us of the ac bonuses.<br/>

&gt; Good news - the imbrued plate dropped in the alter planes for Bards has<br/>
&gt; received an upgrade in AC for several pieces. I don&#39;t know what all the<br/>
&gt; changes were, but ac upgrades are always welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other good news is Imbrued is now dropping again in Plane of Hate.<br/>
&gt; It hasn&#39;t dropped since the patch that tweaked the Monster AI in PoH,<br/>
&gt; and now drops on scorn banshees.<br/>
