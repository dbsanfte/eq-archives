Q2. I changed all the .Ent files to really silly things and made a<br/>
tournament out of it. Nobody ever knew what the next map was going to be<br/>
like. =)<br/>

It&#39;s a shame there&#39;s no &quot;local only&quot; type of EQ server emulator. I&#39;d really<br/>
LOVE to be able to roam Norrath for a day or two with absolutely NO mobs<br/>
anywhere.. Just to see the beauty of some of the things they&#39;ve created that<br/>
I&#39;ll probably never be able to see while playing..</div>
