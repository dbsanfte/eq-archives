<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000011134">Hm.. could it be that you get invited because you&#39;re 40th level? &lt;grin&gt;  I&#39;m<br/>
only level 10 right now. hehe.<br/>
Some friends of mine recently started a guild on Tunare (Crimson Warriors),<br/>
and I&#39;d join, but the name just strikes me as cheesy. :)  Ah well, I&#39;ll<br/>
probably end up joining anyway. :)<br/>
<br/>
One thing about being a bard.. people seem to be very nice to you, for some<br/>
reason.  A dwarf warrior gave me a small bronze cloak, and someone else gave<br/>
me a Mithril Quill, both while I was just hanging out near the bank in<br/>
Freeport waiting for someone.  Others have giving me things, or &#39;traded&#39;<br/>
things as well, where it was obvious I was getting the better end of things.<br/>
I hope this continues into the future. :)  Maybe someone will be nice enough<br/>
to give me some lambent armor.  &lt;wink, wink, nudge, nudge&gt;<br/>
