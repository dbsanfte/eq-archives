<div id="ygrps-yiv-392972161">I have never crashed on the boat, and I always play a song while<br/>
travelling.  I don&#39;t think we can prove this one way or another, but I<br/>
think it is unlikely that our songs are to blame.<br/>

&gt; Butcherblock - the boat crashed three times.  What would happen is<br/>
&gt; first all the other players on the boat would disappear then you&#39;d get<br/>
&gt; dumped...  The first time I was back on the dock in BB then next time<br/>
&gt; on the boat on the way to BB and then finally on the boat on the way<br/>
&gt; to Freeport.     The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny<br/>
&gt; players claimed that the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on<br/>
&gt; the boat...  The first time I was in fact playing a song and thought<br/>
&gt; that it might contribute.  The second time - no bards were playing<br/>
&gt; (assuming no one in the hold was) and it crashed anyways.  I think<br/>
&gt; this was true the third dump as well.     So I am wondering if people<br/>
&gt; have any experience in this.  My gut is that there is no relation<br/>
&gt; between the two - and this is yet another myth (like all bard songs<br/>
&gt; will require mana!) Slyde of Xegony </span></blockquote></div>
