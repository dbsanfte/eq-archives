&gt;Sorry if I babble here, but I agree totally with the post.  Different armor<br/>
&gt;types should offer different forms of protection.  And historically, new<br/>
&gt;armors and weapons were created in an almost medieval arms race, one type<br/>
&gt;designed to combat another.  Like paper scissors stone.  Have heathens with<br/>
&gt;swords?  Invent some plate armor.  Bows killing you&#39;re troops?  Invent<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Most gaming systems factor in some real life concepts about what type of<br/>
&gt;&gt;damage armor can and cannot protect against. Assuming that there are three<br/>
&gt;&gt;types of damage (slash, pierce, and blunt) various armors protect various<br/>
&gt;&gt;ways. From what I&#39;ve seen and heard, most of these are factored in here.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cloth armor isn&#39;t really gonna do much since it is easy to puncture, easy<br/>
&gt;&gt;to cut through, and offers very little padding to slow the impact of<br/>
&gt;&gt;something big and round.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Patchwork usually provides a bit more protection against slash and blunt<br/>
&gt;&gt;since it is slightly thicker than cloth. Piercing it may not improve<br/>
&gt;&gt;against.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The various leathers (rawhide and normal) are better against piercing and<br/>
&gt;&gt;much better against slashing because of the toughness of it. Some are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>often<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;padded decently so it takes the edge off of blunt damage.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Studded leather would most likely improve upon slashing since the metal<br/>
&gt;&gt;studs would help stop the blade but wouldn&#39;t do much for piercing since<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;studs cover such a small area. Blunt might actually hurt more if it hits<br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt;&gt;of the studs and drives it into your chest. =)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Reinforced is the same thing but now there is more surface area to stop<br/>
&gt;&gt;piercing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ring mail works much better against slash since you naw have a shell of<br/>
&gt;&gt;metal around you. Blunt is slightly better since the rings are just linked<br/>
&gt;&gt;and allows for force transferrence over a wider area. Not great though<br/>
&gt;&gt;seeing as how much it gives into you. Piercing? Well, all those rings with<br/>
&gt;&gt;the big holes in them doesn&#39;t stop much of a point. You&#39;d basically be<br/>
&gt;&gt;reduced to whatever padding is underneath.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Chain is the same as ring but usually has tigher links making it a bit<br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt;&gt;difficult to slip a piercer in.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Banded, similar to splint and scale in other game systems, improves<br/>
&gt;against<br/>
&gt;&gt;piercers quite a bit now that most of those holes are filled up. Still<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;between the plates though. Slashing prolly isn&#39;t much better than chain<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;blunt is probably better now that you have plates of metal that won&#39;t give<br/>
&gt;&gt;as easily.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Plate, of course, is usually considered the best. It offers very good<br/>
&gt;&gt;protection against slashers since it is often hard to cut metal. Blunt is<br/>
&gt;&gt;really good since you have that rigitity of a real big piece of metal.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Piercing is better since there are relatively few holes to sneak through<br/>
&gt;&gt;unless you want to try and force the point of a dagger or rapier through a<br/>
&gt;&gt;quarter inch of steel.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Good Journey,<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hello all . . .<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I completed my set of bronze armor, and now I have a few questions about<br/>
&gt;&gt;it if anyone can help.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; AC continues to be a mystery. It seems to be no more than an overall<br/>
 </span></blockquote>armor<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;rating, which increases with level and with type of armor, and exists only<br/>
&gt;&gt;so that I can compare AC values with jealous people who still have<br/>
&gt;&gt;patchwork. Does AC really have a meaning? If so, what does the total AC<br/>
&gt;&gt;value mean? What does the AC value of a single piece of armor mean?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now I know from experience that as soon as I went to full banded, my<br/>
&gt;&gt;ability to take damage skyrocketed. All of the sudden things which used to<br/>
&gt;&gt;destroy me just kept missing me or hitting me for 1 damage. This seems to<br/>
&gt;&gt;suggest it has nothing to do with AC value, and everything to do with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>armor<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;type. The fact that the banded &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 25 from<br/>
&gt;&gt;patchwork was irrelevant.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now my bronze &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 15, a small amount compared<br/>
&gt;&gt;to my overall AC, but again my ability to take damage jumped<br/>
 </span></blockquote>significantly.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;I can again solo everything that is blue.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I read somewhere that each different type of armor (Leather, Chain, Plate<br/>
&gt;&gt;and its equivalents) can absorb more and different types of damage as the<br/>
&gt;&gt;armor gets better. This seems to be true, and seems to make the AC value<br/>
&gt;&gt;worthless . . .<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Besides, full bronze looks really cool.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Please comment . . .<br/>
