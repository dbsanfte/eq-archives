&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Kedge<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue, 7 Mar 2000 02:51:09 EST<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well went to Kedge for the first time. All in all it was disappointing. The<br/>
&gt;fact that I died 3 times and am currently separated from all my equipment<br/>
&gt;(Estrella is sittin on it) doesn&#39;t help any. I wouldn&#39;t suggest anyone <br/>
&gt;trying<br/>
&gt;to find their way outa that place on your first visit. Its quite the maze.<br/>
&gt;Anyways a few interesting things. I was told that they use ice based spells<br/>
&gt;(well, true but they also use fire based and magic based suck as creeping<br/>
&gt;crud). So be prepared with the apropriate songs. Also found our water <br/>
&gt;breathe<br/>
&gt;song stacks fine with enduring breath (but eb can&#39;t be cast on you if the<br/>
&gt;song icon is still on). This was the first night I&#39;ve used the cancel magic<br/>
&gt;song much (thorns and the like on the mermaids) and I noticed there is no<br/>
&gt;confirmation message (nothing like the spell message &quot;feels slightly<br/>
&gt;dispelled&quot;). Be nice to get that lil thing remedied, I like to know if its<br/>
&gt;beind resisted or what.<br/>
&gt;Anyways on to the main reason for this post.<br/>
&gt;This goes out to all yall MM&#39;rs. Tomorrow we&#39;re gonna try a large scale CR<br/>
&gt;but if it doesnt go well i&#39;d like to have some insurance. What I&#39;m looking<br/>
&gt;for is a necro with the summon corpse spell. I&#39;ll give 100 plat to whoever<br/>
&gt;finds the necro and 200 plat (plus 150 for the spell component) to the <br/>
&gt;necro<br/>
&gt;himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks yall.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All mermaids in Kedge are druids. If you have anyone that can cast nullify <br/>
or an enchanter to pillage I would go that route over using bard dispel <br/>
song. They will stinging swarm/creeping crud you, which is not a big deal. <br/>
The main thing is they tend to hit pretty hard in melee and can their nukes <br/>
hurt. They use ignite and combust alot seemingly with a 999 channelling <br/>
skill. They will also use avalanche (or pogonip, whatever the 40-ish <br/>
ice-based druid rain spell is called), which can really HURT. When fighting <br/>
any of the casting mobs in kedge, pixie strike them as soon as you see them <br/>
casting (especially when they try to G Heal themselveS). With my group, we <br/>
are stunning, slamming, and pixie striking our asses off on maids and they <br/>
don&#39;t last too long. Normally the puller is the only one taking much damage.<br/>
