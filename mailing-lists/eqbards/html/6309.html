<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451489409">This is a quest item from an Ogre newbie quest, I believe.  No association to bards, that I know of.  Unless you can get into Ogre town, and live, give it to a newbie Ogre, and let him get a bit of XP from it.  Oh, and I don&#39;t see this quest listed on any of the spoiler sites, but, when I once played an Ogre Shadow Knight, I do remember being given the quest.  (Never got beyond Level 3 with that one, so it is a fairly low level quest, I assume)<br/>

    My friend gave me one of these but it is unequippable and vendors will not buy it. I assume it is a quest item, but I cannot find any quest that needs it. Has anyone else found this or knows what to do with it?</div>
