<div id="ygrps-yiv-211552459">Last night, my friend and I made the attempt to kill Choon, pulled him by<br/>
mistake (went too close) but even though Choon and Froon were standing next<br/>
to each other only choon chased me.<br/>
 I ran around in circles while the mage blasted, unfortunately all his<br/>
spells were resisted and his pet was too weak, so he gated out and left me<br/>
on my own. (Not very nice really)<br/>
I had no chance melleeing Choon, he hit in the 70&#39;s, so I ran around for 20<br/>
minutes trying to get people to help me kill him, finally got to Qeynos<br/>
Hill Zone and met a 39 Mage who killed him for me, and can you believe<br/>
after all that he didn&#39;t even drop the god damn Rune.<br/>
<br/>
Will try again tonight, this time I&#39;m gonna get in a group with someone 30+<br/>
<br/>
Madagan, who only needs the rune to get his Lambent Vambraces!!  8(<br/>

&gt;I can tell you that I went to go kill them one night with a level 31<br/>
&gt;ranger and my 29th druid and the ranger ended up dying (although I was<br/>
&gt;not full mana and wasn&#39;t ready for the pull)...they are mean...conned<br/>
&gt;yellow to me at 29.  If you can keep him from pounding on you too much<br/>
&gt;you may be able to have the mage nuke him  but...at your level I would<br/>
&gt;be really careful adn have an escape route planned....<br/>
