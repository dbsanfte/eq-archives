<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-799449081">Your words will ring very true for many bards out there--myself included.<br/>
 I have been stuck at my 48th song for nearly a month, as I find it<br/>
nearly impossible to find a group.  Yes, they all take the other classes<br/>
we imitate before us, yes few people understand what we can do...but<br/>
there is something else I have noted.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, it may take me forever to find a group, being treated as a<br/>
secondary hole-filler, but I have rarely seen groups fight so hard to<br/>
keep a leaving member as when the bard says goodbye.  When the enchanter<br/>
leaves, they raise a stink, and when the only tank in a caster-heavy<br/>
group tries to go they do their darndest not to let him, but the only<br/>
class I have seen that spends more time convincing their group that they<br/>
*really* have to go is the cleric.  <br/>
<br/>
The last group I was in had two bards and an enchanter.  And even though<br/>
there were two of us, when I tried to leave *at 3:30 am!* it took me<br/>
another ten minutes to convince them that I really was too tired to be<br/>
effective.  At one point, they had let their only healer, a shaman, go<br/>
without a fight.  The main puller left thirty seconds after he announced<br/>
it with little more than goodbyes.  And I, the lowly unwanted bard, hard<br/>
to pry my lambent-clad arms out of their sticky little fingers.<br/>
<br/>
One think to keep in mind is the group I was in--of six of us, the<br/>
original group was four members of Da&#39;Kor, one of Midnight Sojourn, and<br/>
myself.  On Erollisi Marr, no matter what people&#39;s opinions of the guilds<br/>
are, these are generally considered two of the most accomplished (if not<br/>
*the* most accomplished) guilds out there.  The bards I know in both<br/>
guilds are truly amazing, people whose shadows are more daunting than<br/>
most people&#39;s presences.  And though I am not half the bard any of them<br/>
are, the guild members they have trained to appreciate them also<br/>
appreciated me.  Da&#39;Kor actually has only one bard, Elwyn, (/em waves)<br/>
who is generally considered to be the best bard on the server.  It takes<br/>
a good bard (or beyond good, in Elwyn&#39;s case, ;P) to teach people how to<br/>
appreciate a bard.  And sadly, there are so few good bards out there.  So<br/>
it is left up to all us mediocre bards to educate people :)<br/>
<br/>
One specific response to Melaniel, re the below comment; there are a few <br/>
things to keep in mind.  First, many people have bard songs turned off,<br/>
so if, for some reason, they turn them back on, they are completely<br/>
mystified by the messages.  This particular message would make most<br/>
people think *warrior* not *bard*--might you see how that could be<br/>
confusing?  In addition, not all bards choose to play that particular<br/>
song in whatever situation.  By some weird twist of fate, they may never<br/>
have heard the sogn played before, and then the message would, again, be<br/>
confusing.  A lot of people also do not realize that bard songs last past<br/>
the actual time of singing, which *might* explain their comfusion over it<br/>
wearing off.  If you had never thought about it before, you might be a<br/>
little at a loss, yourself.  Perhaps they really are as uneducated as<br/>
they seemed, but I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt.  I<br/>
hope you taught them well what a bard is and does, and that the next bard<br/>
that encounters them will thank their trainer for her efforts ;P<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;After<br/>
&gt;some explaining, they realised that was a song message wearing off.<br/>
&gt;But to make it to 50+ and not ever know that bard songs are temporary,<br/>
&gt;or even see that message before?<br/>
