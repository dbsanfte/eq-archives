&gt; This was intended to be a hard song to use well. The extra Int AND Wis from<br/>
&gt; the same spell are so nice that we needed a drawback.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh. Does anyone actually use this song at all? I think they made the<br/>
drawback a bit too much, as I found the only way to use it was to play<br/>
it just before a fight, then the wizard can med up the extra int it<br/>
gets him and maybe get off one more bolt. All the casters I worked with<br/>
quickly decided it wasn&#39;t worth the extra hassle for what it gave you.<br/>
