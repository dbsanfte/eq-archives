&gt; &gt; Quickness is only 80 mana.  For a L50 enchanter grouped with<br/>
&gt; &gt; all-tanks, giving the entire group Quickness represents only<br/>
&gt; &gt; 400 mana, or about a bubble.  They can med that back in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little over a minute.  Dunno how long it lasts at L50.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SOP for enchanters on CT is to buff with Augmentation, as it lasts about<br/>
&gt; as long as clarity, regens stamina faster (great in Kedge), and gives a<br/>
&gt; minor stat increase (I believe it was to agility and AC, although the<br/>
&gt; former might instigate the latter).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Based on my timings of augmentation and quickness (which agree<br/>
with the info in the spdata.eff file and on castersrealm),<br/>
Quickness is a 30% speedup, while augmentation is a 15%<br/>
speedup.  Being a bard, the primary use I see for augmentation<br/>
is to regenerate stamina, or relieve me from having to keep up<br/>
an attack buff.  I would not use it as a general-purpose<br/>
speedup unless the stuff you are fighting is low blue.<br/>
