Yes, all those messages you ignored saying &quot;Your faction with<br/>
the Cutthroat Dervishes got worse&quot; has a consequence.  :-)<br/>

I&#39;m still trying to figure out what the faction connection is<br/>
with the merchant in the first building on the right as you<br/>

me long before I ever met dervishes.<br/>
