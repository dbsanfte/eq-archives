<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830373311">The same thread is on the warrior list about damage absorption.  It gave me<br/>
a headache there and I won&#39;t argue about it here :)  I&#39;ll agree with one<br/>
point you made though - it is hearsay.<br/>

&gt; &gt; But you can&#39;t say that for everyone.  Some people don&#39;t think it is fun<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never said it for everyone.  The guy asked, so I explained<br/>
&gt; what happens when you effectively twink yourself, and I gave<br/>
&gt; him my prediction.  Whether or not he thinks my prediction<br/>
&gt; applies to him is for him to decide.  I was *warning* him<br/>
&gt; because I don&#39;t think many people who do this kind of stuff<br/>
&gt; realize what they&#39;re missing out on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I agree with some of your points - however I can tell you that twinking<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; not ruin the experience, especially if it is a second character.  With<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; primary character, I have been to every single zone in the game except<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; Solusek A and B and Kedge Keep.  Twinking a second character does not<br/>
&gt; &gt; detract from the experience of the game - it just makes the monotony of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lower levels a little bit easier, and may cut down on the deaths  that<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; would normally get from learning experience.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it is a secondary character, then I wouldn&#39;t do it for<br/>
&gt; reasons I&#39;ll get into in another message in a thread.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If this is a first time character for him, even being in full bronze at<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; level will not matter much.  Full bronze is only 1 point greater than<br/>
&gt; &gt; banded, and alot heavier.  Also your AC is directly related to your<br/>
&gt; Defense<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill (and other modifiers.)  He is still capped at Level * 5, so at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; most he would get maybe a 20-25 point increase in his AC rating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The different armors types have different damage absorptions.<br/>
&gt; I know a lot of monks who decided to switch from a Lockjaw<br/>
&gt; vest (AC 12) to a mesh tunic (AC 8) because mesh has the<br/>
&gt; damage absorption of chain while the LJ vest has the<br/>
&gt; absorption of leather, and they were just taking less damage<br/>
&gt; with the mesh.  So it&#39;s not &quot;just&quot; 1 AC difference.  (Though<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll admit this is hearsay and I haven&#39;t tested it myself.  I<br/>
&gt; did take a helluva lot more damage when I tried switching from<br/>
&gt; plate to mesh, even though my AC was over 100 points higher<br/>
&gt; than when I was last in banded)<br/>
