<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478724326">Heh my friend is thinking about moving his second computer into his bedroom<br/>
just so he can log onto my account and group with my bard while I am at work<br/>
:-)  He thinks it would help his xp to have me just stand there and play<br/>
mana song :-)  I dont think I&#39;ll let him do it though.</div>
