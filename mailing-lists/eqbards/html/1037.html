<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215787108">Where in Highpass is the bank? I&#39;ve looked and looked - and not found it. I <br/>
also admit I scaled back my search somewhat out of concern over some nasty <br/>
prisoners I&#39;ve heard about in there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a bank in High Hold, so you don&#39;t have to risk any valuable<br/>
equipment and money on the trip over; although the place was<br/>
so camped when I went (the mobs there give no less than three<br/>
highly desired magic items) that I didn&#39;t even need<br/>
Accelerando and just walked in.  The layout of HH Pass is<br/>
rather confusing, and if you don&#39;t mind getting a map online,<br/>
I suggest you do so.  There are no 90 degree turns in the<br/>
place, and it&#39;s very easy to get disoriented.<br/>
