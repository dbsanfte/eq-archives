<div id="ygrps-yiv-310640564">Actually Elfson (my formerly lvl 18 bard) had a horrible weekend.  I<br/>
looged on early Super Bowl Sunday, not having much to do before my<br/>
friend&#39;s anti-superbowl party.<br/>
<br/>
About 1 bub above lvl 18, I have grown very tired of Oasis (It is the<br/>
easiest xp in the game, but gets real boring).  I hit the friends list<br/>
and see an enchanter I like is in S karana.  I&#39;ve never gone there<br/>
(except to get to Paw) so I ask her whats up and if she wants her theme<br/>
song (our way of asking if she wants to group).<br/>
<br/>
She says sure, so I fire up Selo&#39;s, hold my stick (errr drum) and run<br/>
off.  AHHH... a bards life is good as I get there quite quickly (even<br/>
stopped to help three newbie groups on the way).<br/>
<br/>
She binds me in arena, and leads me to the second most impressive<br/>
treehouse in Norrath.  We are joined by a rogue and a druid.  Intersting<br/>
group, nice balance if nothing else. (I am the lowest lvl, they are 19,<br/>
21,21).  After a hour we ralize this area is WAYYYY too crowded, so we<br/>
decide to go give Guk a try.  No one in the groups know the way but I<br/>
(calling on that old map I made for my troll&#39;s run from Grobb to Paw<br/>
back in April).  Lake is no problem, even get the group all sing &quot;Come<br/>
sail away&quot; on the boat.  (I love getting the messages to stop spamming<br/>
the /ooc channel).  We are joined by a monk and shaman we know (the<br/>
druid and rogue are first time groupies for us).<br/>
<br/>
Zone to Rathe mts.  Load time is taking a while (Uhoh, thats not good). <br/>
Sound kicks in, I hear combat (ugh...)  Screen appears with a named<br/>
cyclops.  Before I can hit a key, &quot;You have been slain by XXXXXXX. <br/>
Loading, please wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two others in my group suffer the same fate.  &quot;Well at least Elfson can<br/>
run us back quickly, well sort of fast since he doesnt have a drum.&quot; <br/>
Rest of group doesnt know the way so they just hang out at the Rathe<br/>
zone.  We arrive (safely this time).  I lead them to the feerot zone<br/>
(Druid disbanded when she died to the cyclops, not a word said, with<br/>
only a few wrong turns (its been a while, shoot me!).    In ferrot we<br/>
get seperated, but they all seem to know the way, so I just wait for<br/>
them near the Innothule zone.  Being nervous about Bouncerz, I hit the<br/>
f9 a few times, zoom way out so I can see a good area me.  Apparantly<br/>
bounerz can cast invis on themselves because I was being hit before he<br/>
appeared on my screen. Hit, Hit, Bash (stunned), Hit, Hit Hit. <br/>
&quot;Loading, please wait&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Well at least I&#39;m getting good at making this run...  For some odd<br/>
reason the shaman deicdes to go scout Guk for himself and is slain<br/>
pretty deep in Upper Guk while I am running back (and didnt bind himself<br/>
outside Guk).  He was a decent player and a nice guy, so I have no<br/>
complaints. <br/>
<br/>
Finally in Guk (woohoo!!!).  e find the scryer room empty and uncamped<br/>
(Lucky break for a change).  I fire up Elemental Rhythms (no one in<br/>
group knows if elemental or purifying is better for the camp).  The room<br/>
begins to respawn and we easily keep them all down (no scryer yet).  A<br/>
troll and dwarf (red to me from equipment I&#39;d guess warrior and cleric)<br/>
walk into room and look around, then leave (more on them later).  We are<br/>
in the midst of a heated battle (Shin shaman and some gaz stuff, little<br/>
Elfy is taking a pretty hard beating, but the group is doing enough to<br/>
keep me alive).  ALl of sudden troll and dwarf deposit about 5 more<br/>
frogs on our heads (we were on the altar fighting, not in the path of<br/>
someone trying to flee to zone).  <br/>
&quot;Loading, please wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Getting cocky running through the lake, I activate the bandit camp (all<br/>
green to me, but they manage to beat me down to a bubble of life before<br/>
I zone.  Heal up at the Rathe zone, then zone into Feerot.  Long load<br/>
time (not again!), I hear a weird sound, and as my screen comes up I am<br/>
treated to a scythe armed spectre swing his final shot at me.<br/>
&quot;You have lost a level!  Welcome to level 17.  Loading, please wait.&quot; <br/>
At least I got to see spectre up close, they are pretty darn cool.<br/>
<br/>
After another long run, I rejoin the group in Guk.  Still in scryer room<br/>
(he was killed by a high level while they regrouped).  Too many of them<br/>
spawn on us at once this time. We all die.<br/>
&quot;Loading, please wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Zoning back into the Rathe Mt zone.  I get the all too familar long load<br/>
time, sounds of combat, and screen comes up with real nasty critter<br/>
(cyclops this time).<br/>
&quot;Loading, please wait&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I look at the clock.  Its been 6 hours, I&#39;ve lost almost half a level. <br/>
And realized how much I disliked this. /g Once we get corpses, I&#39;m<br/>
camping, sorry to bail.  Talking to the enchanter I tell her that I&#39;m<br/>
definitly taking some time away from the game but to look for my cleric<br/>
on Thurs as I won&#39;t bail on my regular group (for now).<br/>
<br/>
I thought about it for awhile yesterday (took a road trip to New York<br/>
with some friends to eat at WWF: new York and see FAO Shwartz, Central<br/>
Park, etc...)  At some point this game has stopped being fun for me.  I<br/>
like role-playing my bard, I liek meeting and talking with people, but<br/>
to be honest the down side of the game has tipped the balance for me. <br/>
There are too many bugs, too many people, too many &quot;You KSing fgth!!!!&quot;<br/>
shouts, and too many bad decisions by Verant.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe after a week with no barding my mind will change, but I doubt it. <br/>
In the last two weeks, I&#39;ve found myself spending time browsing through<br/>
my local game stores looking for a good RPG I may have missed.  (I won<br/>
Torment, and haven&#39;t found anything yet to take its place)<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying this to bash Verant, to try to get you to quit or try to<br/>
get you to convince me to keep playing (I have neglected too much RL for<br/>
this game).  Verant as a whole did a great job with this game.  Perhaps<br/>
thats the problem, it is so tantalizing close to greatness that its<br/>
short-comings glare so brightly.  Most of the people playing are fun,<br/>
polite, and enhance the experience.  However they only make the<br/>
obnoxious players a little harder to ignore.<br/>
<br/>
Well until Diablo II makes it to the shelves, &quot;See you around&quot;<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
