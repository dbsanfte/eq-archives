&gt; ran out to nroth karana to try it out. I charmed a lion, and got it to<br/>
&gt; attack a snake, then i redid thia until the snake started running, i asked<br/>
&gt; the lion to go attack it. It ran off and 20 seconds later i it was dead.<br/>
&gt; Then i went to south kara and charmed an elephant, i got it to attack a<br/>
&gt; minotaur and when the charm ran otiu they ran towards me, and beat the<br/>
&gt; livin #%@$ outta me =( i got rooted or something and i couldnt cast. So my<br/>
