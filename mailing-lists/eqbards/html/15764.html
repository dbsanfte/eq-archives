<div id="ygrps-yiv-354771025">At least a yk is worth the camp time...with my rogue I camped the warden in upper guk to get a trollhide belt, and after 12 hours I still hadn&#39;t gotten it.  Thats 12 hours of 0 exp, 0 loot, and one immense headache.<br/>

  How in the world to people obtain Ykeshas these days?  I heard they used to<br/>
  drop a lot more often but this is absurd.  Yesterday I logged on at 11am CST<br/>
  in lguk and joined a Savant group, sent a tell to the list holder of the<br/>
  Lord group and started killing frogs.  I was finally called for my turn in<br/>
  the Lord group at 6pm CST, 7 hours later.  Shortly after I arrived one of<br/>
  the people ahead of me on the list fell asleep after an 18 hour camp and the<br/>
  guy after him got a Yak.  <br/>
<br/>
  The group changed a couple times in the next hour so by 8pm I was on the top<br/>
  of the list for a Yak, 2 hours after joining the group.  We then camped the<br/>
  room and I finally gave up with no Yak (5 SSB&#39;s) at 2:30am, 7 and a half<br/>
  hours and no Yak.  By the time I left I was the only original group member<br/>
  left.  <br/>
<br/>
  Meanwhile people continue to berate me for wielding a staff of writhing at<br/>
  42nd level.  What&#39;s a bard to do, has it always been this tough of a camp?<br/>
  This is totally absurd.<br/>
