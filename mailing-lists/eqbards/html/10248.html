&gt; Hmm, you may be right.  The only reason I can see for Chain to<br/>
&gt; override root is because it also has a slowdown component.<br/>
&gt; But that doesn&#39;t make sense if you follow my thinking that<br/>
&gt; stronger effects should override weaker.  Yet if you have<br/>
&gt; enchanter celerity and bard celerity, you get the enchanter<br/>
&gt; speedup AND the bard stat boost.<br/>

Chains breaks root, yet it is not as great a slowdown effect.<br/>
<br/>
Snare bounces off of something that is chained, even though snare has a greater slowdown effect.<br/>
<br/>
There could be a couple of reasons for this.  A root effect is probably a different effect than a movement<br/>
reducing effect.  Note how rooted creatures behave differently than snared creatures (they always try to<br/>
run, rather than fight).<br/>
<br/>
Also, songs could override spells all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just conjecture.<br/>
<br/>
According to the EQSS spells database, which is the actual spell data file parsed out:<br/>
<br/>
Snare:  Mobility -40 - (level * 1.0)   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.darkflame.org/data.pl?mode=EQSS&uline=ON&snum=242">http://www.darkflame.org/data.pl?mode=EQSS&uline=ON&snum=242</a><br/>
<br/>
Chains: Mobility -30<br/>
            Attack Speed 95<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps chains overrides snare because of the attack speed modification.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Root:  Mobility -10000<br/>

<br/>
Same parameter as the others.  So my theory doesn&#39;t hold much water. :)<br/>
