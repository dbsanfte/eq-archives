<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492164899">Clavicus still sings Hymn in the Planes. (and fills up one&#39;s screen<br/>
doing it. Clavicus&#39;s song ends....) He twists Hymn and Clarity between<br/>
pulls. Windsong doesn&#39;t because she&#39;s already got wrist problems even<br/>
before this!<br/>
<br/>
What I know I have seen -- Clarity (of course), the &quot;Bind Sight&quot;<br/>
song (Windsong saw Clavicus using this. And then did it in Fear the<br/>
other night to help choose pulls), Chains when snare won&#39;t hold<br/>
for one reason or another. I&#39;m sure there are others. Those are<br/>
just the ones I&#39;ve noticed for sure. She doesn&#39;t seem to think<br/>
her songs are worthless at all. I&#39;ve even seen her<br/>
sit down between battles and mem new songs! And, when it comes<br/>
to fighting, she is in their swinging with the rest. I have never<br/>
heard her complain about being a level 50 bard.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are EAGERLY desired by Phoenix on the planes, to the point they<br/>
are encouraged to come even to Fear where no bard armor drops until<br/>
they are sick of it.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know a level 7 bard can take out yellow giant wasps solo?<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;  With your knowledge of Lullaby now, would you even consider firing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;  up that song in LGuk?  Lullaby was awesome when I used it, oh about<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;  30 levels ago.  I can&#39;t even keep 3 snakes asleep now.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hrm... Interesting. Maybe you have something here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m just grumpy that&#39;s all, I loved the tactics I got to employ<br/>
&gt;   during my 20s, and even low 30s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   What happens is our so/so melee and so/so magic don&#39;t strike<br/>
&gt;   with the force they used to when we were little.  Verant puts<br/>
&gt;   magic resistances on things through the roof to prevent chain<br/>
&gt;   IC wizards and makes the mobs melee skills so incredibly high<br/>
&gt;   that they can decimate a warrior in a few rounds.  When you<br/>
&gt;   toss in a bard, who excels at neither melee nor magic, the<br/>
&gt;   bard truly becomes a speed/mana support class.  Since his other<br/>
&gt;   magic doesn&#39;t have the effectiveness it used to and his melee<br/>
&gt;   coupled with low hp and mediocre ac usually gets him killed<br/>
&gt;   in toe to toe combat, Verant ends up just dishing out frustration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Speaking from the L50 perspective, you will be playing Victory<br/>
&gt;   and Clarit and most likely nothing else.  You may need to Chains<br/>
&gt;   something once in a while, you may need to AE fear things.  You<br/>
&gt;   won&#39;t be using any other AE songs, including Lullaby.  You won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;   healing anyone anymore.  I use my Solidarity of Vision more than<br/>
&gt;   Hymm nowadays.  Dirge, yeah that&#39;s laughable.  Charm, we all<br/>
&gt;   know it&#39;s limitation.  Pixie Strike is good once in a while,<br/>
&gt;   but not against anything in the Planes (for all purposes).  The L50<br/>
&gt;   perspective also isn&#39;t fighting tower froggies or dogs in SolB, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   in the Planes or against a Dragon, at that point you will feel your<br/>
&gt;   true worth. (or lack there of)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;d like to say there&#39;s something cool at L50 we do, and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;   racked my mind for hours trying to figure it out.  It&#39;s just<br/>
&gt;   so hard to find something other than Victory/Clarit.<br/>
