have been working so hard to start. :o) Yup, you were right, for me at low<br/>
25 Crag spiders were a blast, and on a whim I included melifluous Motion, it<br/>
was really kind of useful! My banks for last night:<br/>
<br/>
(1)<br/>
1:lute<br/>
2:horn<br/>
3:DDD<br/>
4:CoD<br/>
5:Largos Binding<br/>
6: Hymn<br/>
<br/>
(2)<br/>
1:lute<br/>
2:horn<br/>
3:DDD<br/>
4:CoD<br/>
5:Selos Chain (for pulling and runners, since the spiders don&#39;t run I think<br/>
I will change to bellow)<br/>
6: Hymn<br/>
<br/>
(3) The Brave Sir Robin Bank<br/>
1:lute<br/>
2:horn<br/>
3:Drum<br/>
4:Selos Accelerondo<br/>
5:Melifluous Motion<br/>
6: Hymn<br/>
<br/>
When it looked like the spider was winning I hit MMotion, then selos and<br/>
armed the drum, ran till the spider was no longer chasing me, healed and<br/>
went back to try again. Since the spider was still agro it found *me* once I<br/>
got close enough. I thiiink I am going to ask for that collar of Undead<br/>
Protection back from the Enchanter for a bit, I could use the +7 poison...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, for a break I may go visit the Hermit, or Najina, or...gah, I<br/>
am hooked again.<br/>
