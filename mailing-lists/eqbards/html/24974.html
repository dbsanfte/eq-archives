<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-698975337">Was even better when they recharged every time you zoned instead of at the<br/>
cleric guild.  Dunno if that was in final or beta, but I definitely had the<br/>
ring when it did that.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Actually I found this to be one of the more satisfying and <br/>
&gt; logical quests<br/>
&gt; out there in the early days.  Compared to the rusty weapons <br/>
&gt; most quests gave<br/>
&gt; you back then the Squad Ring was awesome.  It was quite a <br/>
&gt; badge of honor<br/>
&gt; back then since you had to devote a lot of time to keeping <br/>
&gt; Rivervale free of<br/>
&gt; goblins and orcs to get one.  The 100pt heal may not sound <br/>
&gt; like much to us<br/>
&gt; now, but I was only 9th level when I got it and it definitely <br/>
&gt; saved my life<br/>
&gt; more than a dozen times back then.  It also allowed me to <br/>
&gt; help others in<br/>
&gt; trouble who were not in my group for the first time.<br/>
