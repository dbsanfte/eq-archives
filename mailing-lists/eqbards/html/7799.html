Well if it works it does sound like the fastest way to travel between<br/>
continents.  No more waiting for the boat:-)  <br/>
<br/>
How would someone go about doing this to themselves?  I would guess that the<br/>
only way we could kill ourselves without causing EXP loss would be with DDD,<br/>
CofD, or bellow.  I have never tried targetting myself with these so have no<br/>
idea if they damage you or not.  I thought I read somewhere that if you die<br/>
from a DOT cast my a player while dueling you will still take an EXP loss.<br/>
This could apply here also so you would only want to use it to get yourself<br/>
very low and then bellow from there.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if this method does work, it only goes to show you that players will<br/>
always figure out a way to do something that the game designer never<br/>
contemplated.  While it would definately be an exploit, I would term it an<br/>
ingenious exploit and not a stupid one:-).<br/>

&gt; No, attacking youself never causes a guard to go off on you. Of course, by<br/>
&gt; attacking yourself I mean casting harmful spells on yourself. You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; actually melee with yourself. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure about the idea that killing yourself doesn&#39;t cause experience<br/>
&gt; loss. Maybe not blowing yourself up, I&#39;m not sure. But I&#39;m fairly certain<br/>
&gt; that killing yourself by non-combat methods, like drowning or falling from<br/>
&gt; great heights, still causes experience loss.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s got to be the stupidest exploit I have ever heard.  I seriously<br/>
&gt; hope<br/>
&gt; you were being sarcastic John.  I wonder, if a guard will attack you if<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; attack a player, since you are a player, will attacking yourself cause him<br/>
&gt; to kill you?<br/>
