<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088559111">You need to lull one and attack the other.  It is reputed to be harder to<br/>
lull many and be ready for all of them if it fails.  For a multiple mob<br/>
spawn (4 or 5 up at one time) you&#39;d have to lull all except the one you want<br/>
to attack.  Then drag it out and kill it.  Rinse, repeat.<br/>

		I know that this song has been talked about a whole<br/>
lot...but sadly i missed <br/>
		all of it. All I want to know is how you can take out a<br/>
whole camp using it? <br/>
		I tried this but it did not seem to work. I fought the orcs<br/>
in east <br/>
		commonlands in their camps for quite a while. If i used the<br/>
song on one and <br/>
		then attacked it, when it left camp, the rest of the orcs<br/>
followed. Can <br/>
		somebody just explain all the uses of it?<br/>
		Thanks...<br/>
