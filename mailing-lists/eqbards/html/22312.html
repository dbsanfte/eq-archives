<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705948082">After reading, Kitasi&#39;s initial post below, I decided to test out Lullaby on<br/>
a drolvarg rager (IIRC 35+ mob, blue to me at 40) in Dreadlands.  With lute<br/>
equipped, I put him to sleep 3 straight times.  He then resisted twice<br/>
(normal resist message).  I put him to sleep twice more in a row.  Then he<br/>
resisted twice in a row.  I was down to half health so thats when my group<br/>
started to attack.  Not once did I get a secondary resist message.  So it<br/>
looks like what Kitasi pointed out is true and that aspect of the song has<br/>
been changed.<br/>
<br/>
My guild had a mid level raid in Droga this weekend.  Our highest level<br/>
enchanter was 30th level so, based on my semi-success with the drolvarg<br/>
rager, I had Lullaby memmed in case things turned sour.  Somehow or another,<br/>
whether it was due to a pathing AI bug, a caster using AE spells, etc, we<br/>
got swarmed by 10+ mobs.  The enchanter went down quick so I started singing<br/>
Lullaby non-stop. I wasn&#39;t near as successful with these mobs as I was with<br/>
the drolvarg rager.  I probably got 75%+ resists on the song.  When it went<br/>
into effect, my text screen would usually fill up with at least 6-8 resist<br/>
messages.  But I never got a secondary resist message like before.  After<br/>
our healer went OOM, I was forced to sing fear so we could evac/gate.  Was<br/>
not a pretty sight as almost everyone got killed.  Fortunately we had a 50+<br/>
monk and 50+ cleric for CR.  <br/>
<br/>
Based on my results in Droga, Lullaby is going back into the songbook until<br/>
I see its been changed in a patch message.<br/>

Ok, had a chance to quiz GZ on the songs this weekend at eqfest 2000 in<br/>
Houston, TX.<br/>
<br/>
Pixe and such, are being/have been changed, during the patches that are<br/>
going live...he wasn&#39;t specific on it.<br/>
<br/>
LULLABYE WILL BE CHANGED!<br/>
<br/>
GZ: &quot;Look for some VERY interesting things to be happening to Lullaby soon&quot;<br/>
GZ: &quot;We have been thinking about bard mez, we didn&#39;t want them to infringe<br/>
on the Enchanter role, as that is what Enchanters do best, BUT we don&#39;t<br/>
think that giving bards some mez abilities will hurt&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These are not exact quotes, but pretty close.<br/>

p.s. One helluva weekend, even if it felt like being in the Karana&#39;s.<br/>
EQFest 2000 was a blast!<br/>
Check out eq.stratics.com and watch the official eq site for news!<br/>
Thanks Ron!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Well, supposedly no.  However the spdat.eff file did get patched last<br/>
&gt; weekend when I logged in.  They can also change some spell effects in the<br/>
&gt; database without taking the servers down.  I think this might actually<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; gone in with the last patch and may have either been unintentional, or<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; may be trying it out to see if they see any unbalancing effects from it<br/>
&gt; being live before they announce that it is live.  That way if they have to<br/>
&gt; change it fewer people will notice.<br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t think the server I am on (E&#39;ci) has gone down for the scheduled<br/>
server<br/>
&gt; maintenance Abashi mentioned.  Haven&#39;t noticed any downloaded files<br/>
either.<br/>
&gt; Kitasi and I play on the same server so thats why I was wondering if the<br/>
&gt; patch went in unannounced.<br/>

&gt; At 09:46 AM 11/3/00 -1000, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt;Has the patch that will improve Pixie Strike, Song of Twilight and nerf<br/>
&gt; &gt;Jonthan&#39;s Provocation even gone in yet? I was under the impression that<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt;wouldn&#39;t go in until sometime next week.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; has either your server gone down or have you downloaded any new files?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; if not, then it is impossible.<br/>
