 </span></blockquote>  Last night I did bugs/bats in SolB with no healer whatsoever.<br/>
  Best experience I&#39;ve gotten in a long time.  2 noxs, 1 death<br/>
  beetle, and no show on guano or stone.  At one point we had<br/>
  3 bats and 2 ldcs.  A group with a healer would have fled,<br/>
  but this group finished all the battles at full hp.  How?<br/>
<br/>
  2 paladins, 1 enchanter, 1 bard, 1 monk, 1 wizard.<br/>
<br/>
  Enchanter does her thing, per usual.  AE mez, AE stun.<br/>
  Paladins are key to this.  They can heal in a pinch if<br/>
  needed.  But they are the stunner elite.  They are non-<br/>
  stop stunning the mob during the fight.  So much so, that<br/>
  not one ldc hit us between the paladins and the enchanter<br/>
  stunning.  In fact, I have never killed ldcs and bats as<br/>
  fast as I did in this group ever.. in my whole experience.<br/>
  SLTW + sash + song = melee blender.  At one point, one of<br/>
  the paladins never stopped swinging.  I never saw his sword<br/>
  pause, it was always going.  This same group could have <br/>
  easily broken the lord room full lord/bok spawn, sans healer.<br/>
