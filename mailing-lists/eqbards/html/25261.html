<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-430970968">On Xegony, a year ago or so, the Xegony Alliance was formed to allow smaller<br/>
and medium sized guilds to do things - like Dragon and Planes Raids that<br/>
were previously the domain of only a handful of larger guilds.  Needless to<br/>
say - as players got to higher levels they would feel forced to leave their<br/>
guilds or only do &quot;pickup raids&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously - such an organization requires a calendar - which (along with the<br/>
link to the Ezboard forum) can be reached at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.xegonyalliance.com">http://www.xegonyalliance.com</a><br/>
to schedule the raids.  Some conflicts in scheduling had arisen earlier - so<br/>
the calendar was opened up to allow private raids to be shown.<br/>
<br/>
This always been extremely controversial.  Many people would like to turn<br/>
the XA colander into a reservation system as exists on some servers - some<br/>
people seeing this as a panacea to solving every problem that has ever<br/>
occurred on our server.  Others, citing problems on other servers, actual or<br/>
hypothetical situations, liken a reservation system to communism (someone<br/>
actually posted that on the backstage board).<br/>
<br/>
Regardless - many guilds and the XA Raids themselves of course - use the<br/>
calendar was what is described as an &quot;Intention system&quot; - i.e. - we &quot;Intend&quot;<br/>
to raid at this time and this location with these people.  We can&#39;t force<br/>
other guilds to respect it; but at the very least - when people who have<br/>
signed up appear in a guild raid that started 45 minutes earlier - they<br/>
certainly can&#39;t claim ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Vox and Nag; given that Xegony is one of the original servers;<br/>
only a minority of players can fight those mobs - so most of the larger and<br/>
most powerful guilds don&#39;t even bother.  There are a couple of newer<br/>
guilds - Circle of Valor I believe being one - that has being going after<br/>
Vox a lot (and with some difficulty).<br/>
<br/>
I did Nag 3 times and each one was successful.  I did Vox twice and failed<br/>
both times.  The first time because we sent too many people in - and had<br/>
major LD problems every time the AOE spell went off.  The second time - we<br/>
didn&#39;t have enough stunners or mana drain - and she CH&#39;d herself when the<br/>
health bar was at &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Lady Vox&quot;.  We then would have succeeded if he had<br/>
properly timed the respawns of the IG&#39;s but a couple spawned and killed off<br/>
the raid.<br/>
<br/>
I would think you won&#39;t have problems getting at Vox and Nag - you&#39;re<br/>
biggest problem will be finding enough people at the level range who are<br/>
willing to follow directions properly.  You&#39;ll probably get mostly new<br/>
players who are inexperienced at raiding.<br/>
