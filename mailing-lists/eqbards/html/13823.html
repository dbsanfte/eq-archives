<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405435103">My take on this is that these two instuments will only be discovered if<br/>
Verant leaks the information.  This would be similar to the bog juice leak<br/>
that occured several months ago.  For those you unaware, bog juice is<br/>
required by paladins for the Soulfire quest.  Verant stated for a very long<br/>
time that bog juice was in the game.  The problem was that there weren&#39;t any<br/>
clues, i.e. recipe books or NPC keywords, that gave brewers any help.  The<br/>
only way anyone found out how to brew bog juice was when a Verant employee<br/>
posted the recipe on alt.games.everquest.  The required components for bog<br/>
juice are so non-logical that there was no way anyone could have figured it<br/>
out using systematic procedures.  I can&#39;t remember all the ingredients but<br/>
the key one was snake skins, which no brewer ever considered using as a<br/>
brewing component.  Within the next day or so after the post on the<br/>
newsgroup, paladins were able to complete the Soulfire quest.<br/>
<br/>
In this particular case Verant was telling the truth, but the odds of a<br/>
player figuring out how to brew bog juice on their own were infintesimal.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well its been several months now since they were first mentioned in a<br/>
&gt; patch<br/>
&gt; and still no one has discovered a small brass trumpet or Kelin&#39;s practice<br/>
&gt; Lute.  I know not all bards spend as much time running around asking<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; about quests as I do, but still given the amount of time I am fairly<br/>
&gt; certain<br/>
&gt; that if these really were in the game they would have been found by now.<br/>
&gt; GZ<br/>
&gt; insisted they really were in the game, but that we would have to look hard<br/>
&gt; for them.  I have checked nearly every merchant outside of the evil cities<br/>
&gt; and the gnomes in solusek, but have had no luck.  Why they would be in any<br/>
&gt; of those places anyhow is beyond me.  Does anyone have any other ideas, or<br/>
&gt; is this something we need to somehow emphasize further that despite Verant<br/>
&gt; thinking &#39;It&#39;s in the game&#39; it isn&#39;t?  Certainly wouldn&#39;t be the first<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; they were &#39;positive&#39; that something was in the game when it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; especially concerning bards.  I&#39;m sure everyone over 46 remembers the<br/>
&gt; scorned banshees they swore up and down were dropping Imbrued when they<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; not.  Any ideas?<br/>
