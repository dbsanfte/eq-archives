<div id="ygrps-yiv-952841180">Actually my main char was a Dark Elf and guess what. You rarely run to the<br/>
guards. For the most part most newbies of the evil races rarely run to the<br/>
guards. I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to run to the guards you don&#39;t<br/>
lose any expierence at levels 1-5 and then when you do it&#39;s easyto gain it<br/>
back. Personally I have no problem with people killing guards. I also don&#39;t<br/>
see why others complainbecause it gets you ready for the higher levels when<br/>
there are no guards around to help.<br/>

&gt; OK,<br/>
&gt; BEFORE this gets KABONG&#39;d..and it will, no doubt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You have hit on my PERSONAL PET PEEVE.  NOTHING annoys<br/>
&gt; my more than level 50 people, bored, sitting in Newbie<br/>
&gt; zones and killing the guards there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night, there was a level 50 Warrior sitting in<br/>
&gt; Rivervale killing the Town guards.  Not the Wall<br/>
&gt; guards, where the average player who runs to them is<br/>
&gt; level 5 to 12, but the town ones...where the only<br/>
&gt; players running to them is around level 1 to 3.<br/>
&gt; I spent 2 hours helping every newbie I could there<br/>
&gt; (with my Cleric, so I could heal them).  Its hard<br/>
&gt; enough for a newbie to start on older servers, without<br/>
&gt; high level IDIOTS making things tougher on them for a<br/>
&gt; lark (NOTE:  It was on MM, and No, it was NOT<br/>
&gt; Shada...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone kills the Inky guards in Nek forest.  That<br/>
&gt; must make life Soooo fun for the New Dark Elf players.<br/>
&gt;  All I&#39;m asking is that you THINK about your actions<br/>
&gt; BEFORE you do something that may have such an impact.<br/>
