<b>Subject:</b> Sliding problems <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132390942">I had big problems last night with my movement keys. I use a lot of &quot;slide <br/>
left&quot; and &quot;slide right&quot; movement in battle (old Doom/Quake habit). However, <br/>
I noticed now that when I press the &quot;shift&quot; key to slide, it locks me in <br/>
the same direction of movement (if I were turning then I start spinning).<br/>
<br/>
I sent a bug report in last night, and even submitted a petition. Was <br/>
surprised a guide contacted me (since I said that this was a low priority <br/>
in the grand scheme of things) and he told me to try to press my right <br/>
mouse button to slide. I tried this, even though I usually use my right <br/>
hand for the movement keys, but it didn&#39;t work. He didn&#39;t have any idea <br/>
what I could try to fix, since I mentioned I even tried remapping the <br/>
history commands to different keys.<br/>
<br/>
He suggested I wipe my opt files, but I just did that last week, so <br/>
everything is pretty clean. So I submitted a bug.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had similar problems and if so, anyone figure a way to fix it?<br/>
