<div id="ygrps-yiv-952204410">wondering what quests you are hoping the guise will allow you to do.  you<br/>
may be able to use a guise/carillion combo in some cases, but the npcs also<br/>
look at class in many cases and it won&#39;t help you.  i.e. i went into neriak<br/>
for the first time and the guards still scowl at me with the dark elf<br/>
illusion.  just curious though, i have not extensively tested this.<br/>
