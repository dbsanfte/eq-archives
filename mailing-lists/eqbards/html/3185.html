<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588412147">I have to disagree with Adam here, based on personal experience.  I have both a whip<br/>
and a PGT, (and a dragoon dirk and an ashenwood spear, to make the weapon buffet even<br/>
more complicated), and I quickly decided to go with the tomahawk instead of the whip<br/>
for the weapon in my off hand.  The main reason is that despite the agility loss, the<br/>
damage absorbtion is very cruicial for me.<br/>
<br/>
My permanent party is a three person group, bard, magician and druid, and as a result,<br/>
I am always the tank.  Even if that &quot;magic skin&quot; only absorbs one hit, that&#39;s 50-100<br/>
less damage, for SURE that I&#39;m not taking.   Yes, my agility drops to 90 or something,<br/>
but 90 isn&#39;t exactly a BAD agility.  I would have to say that on average, the agility<br/>
drop is NOT going to be costing me more damage than the skin is saving me, if you<br/>
understand what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Your mileage, of course, may vary.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve used both weapons, and I would say go with the barbed whip. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; used both, and I defintely prefer the whip. Why? The whip usually sells<br/>
&gt; for 100pp compared to the PGT which sells for around 200pp. Big help<br/>
&gt; there. You say you can afford the PGT, and you want that cool berserk<br/>
&gt; effect though? That effect is useless. When you first get it in your<br/>
&gt; high teens its somewhat helpful, but when you move into your mid-20s its<br/>
&gt; useless and a detriment sometimes. Right now I gain 20 str, and lose 12<br/>
&gt; agi(as I grow in levels I see to lose more agi; I originally lost only 8<br/>
&gt; agi). That 12 agi loss is a BIG thing, and that magic skin you get maybe<br/>
&gt; lasts you a round or two in battle. Stuff that I hunt at 25 can easily<br/>
&gt; hit for over 100hp if it gets a good hit off(alligators in cazic fo<br/>
&gt; example), and the whole proc is gone 5 secs after it went into effect.<br/>
&gt; Sure it may have saved me from damage, but I could&#39;ve avoided that hit<br/>
&gt; without the agi loss. Get the barbed whip, its better in the long run.<br/>
