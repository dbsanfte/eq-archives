<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429333413">You are correct in a technical sense, but as many people have stated in this<br/>
forum, you can easily have the effects of two songs occur simultaneously<br/>
(i.e Twisting).  If you are good at it, you can have three songs in effect<br/>
at one time.  Is this considered an exploit?  I don&#39;t think so because if it<br/>
was you probably would have heard something official about it from Verant a<br/>
long time ago.  Also, I don&#39;t think it should be an exploit for the<br/>
following reason.  Lets say I am in a combat and I am singing the Chords of<br/>
Dissonance.  Halfway through the battle I decide to switch to the Hymn of<br/>
Restoration because I have taken a lot of hits.  I start singing the Hymn<br/>
and soon both the Chords and the Hymn are in effect.  I am doing nothing<br/>
wrong at this point because I am just the game exactly as it was designed to<br/>
be played.  No way can anyone say I should wait until the effect of the<br/>
Chords completely dissipate before I start singing the Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
The question I have is this:  Is the ability to twist multiple songs<br/>
something that Verant has programmed into the game on purpose? Or, is the<br/>
effect of twisting a potential byproduct of lag?    <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Simple answer . . . you can&#39;t sing more than one at a time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To figure out why, trying singing Happy Birthday and Three Blind Mice at<br/>
&gt; the same time to your friends and family. If you succeed, call Verant and<br/>
&gt; tell them EQ is unrealistic . . . :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt;Pray, fellow singers of songs, I am but the 7th circle, and while most<br/>
&gt; glib, talented, and quite handsome (and I say this most humbly), I do not<br/>
&gt; know how to sing more than one song ata a time!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Please, friends can anyone enlighten me?<br/>
&gt; &gt;                 Many Thanks,<br/>
