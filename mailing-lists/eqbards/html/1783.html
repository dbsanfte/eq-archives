<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831308431">Seems bad on Solusek Ro also. I tend to see barbed whips for for<br/>
200-250pp on Solusek Ro, and tomahawks for 200-400pp(or 150 if its a<br/>
group sell thing).<br/>

&gt; As always, J.M Capozzi&#39;s advice is very sound.  One thing though, barbed leather<br/>
&gt; whips just cannot be bought for 50 plat anymore.  Neither can Polished Granite<br/>
&gt; Tomahawks for 250 plat (though that is closer to the market price).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The general price that these are selling for on Karana is something like 100 to<br/>
&gt; 150 for the whips, and 250 to 400 for the tomahawks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you can find a lower price on your server, by all means, go for it. :)<br/>
