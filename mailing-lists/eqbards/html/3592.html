knights and blue-white Ton warrior/knights.  Try this.  Go<br/>
over that annoying plank bridge.  It&#39;ll open up into a room<br/>
with a square well-looking thing in the middle.  On the far<br/>
right is a hallway leading down.  To the left of that is a<br/>
short passage which ends at a ledge with a plank leading down<br/>
into a large room.  Go into that room.  If you survive more<br/>
than 30 seconds, I&#39;ll believe you.  :-)  My L24 cleric friend<br/>
got lost there and was killed by a huge mob of frogs our last<br/>
Guk trip. I consider this area to be close to the middle of<br/>
Upper Guk.<br/>

At 26, the Shin warriors and shamen, Ton knights, and some Gaz<br/>
warriors were still blue to me.<br/>

26 pounds wearing mesh (vs. 68 for mostly bronze).  I would&#39;ve<br/>
loved to have stayed lightweight, but the damage I was taking<br/>
was nasty - reminded me of back when I was in my teens.<br/>
