<div id="ygrps-yiv-418888408">just a few thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve had several machines using the via 133 (not 133a) chipset locking up<br/>
with various video cards using the later drivers.  unfortunately, it&#39;s not<br/>
one specific video card, or driver...it seems to be somewhat random.<br/>
as for your problem, make SURE that voodoo is not overheating.  if it&#39;s<br/>
being jerky and whatnot sometimes, and locks up with newer drivers, sounds<br/>
like you have a clockspeed/heating problem.  for gits and shiggles, try<br/>
running the machine with the case open and a small house fan blowing through<br/>
it.  if that seems to cure the problem, then you have airflow blockage, so<br/>
you need new fans/more fans, something.  also, check to make sure that the<br/>
cabling for the hard drive/floppy drive, etc. are not hanging in the way of<br/>
the fans/airflow.  we use zip-tie strips to get them out of the way of the<br/>
airflow when we build machines at work.<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>

<br/>

&gt; question about the voodoo3 3000.  i have this on my ex-wife&#39;s computer,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; things in game &quot;seem&quot; ok performance-wise.  but when logging in at the<br/>
&gt; server selection screen if there is any type of banner announcement it<br/>
&gt; scrolls incredibly slow, and on the character select screen her characters<br/>
&gt; spin around extremely slow and very jerky as well.  so this has me<br/>
wondering<br/>
&gt; if in-game performance is also sufferring.  i&#39;m not sure if that is<br/>
normal,<br/>
&gt; or i am just used to my geforce.  she has an abit va6 motherboard (via<br/>
&gt; apollo pro 133, not 133a chipset, has agp 2X which i guess i should make<br/>
&gt; sure is enabled but i thought so for sure), 3dfx drivers version 1.3.05<br/>
&gt; (versions 1.4 and 1.5 lock up the system), p3-533B cpu.  i know on my asus<br/>
&gt; p3v4x installing the via agp driver increased performance a lot, but when<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; tried on her system it said it was for agp 4x only.  i may try that again<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; hers, but i installed an older via agp driver on hers once and saw no<br/>
&gt; difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; any ideas are greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have recently upgraded my video card to a GeForce2 GTS from<br/>
&gt; &gt; a Voodoo3<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3000.  The Voodoo3 was fine except some spell effects would<br/>
&gt; &gt; lag me down,<br/>
&gt; &gt; most notably the AOE rain type spells.<br/>
