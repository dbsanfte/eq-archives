<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281535916">Tips on leveling faster:<br/>
<br/>
Running around trying to find best xp, or something new and exciting to kill<br/>
is horrible to do, if you want to level fast, kill the stuff you know.<br/>
However, if the stuff you know is too camped, it might be necessary<br/>
to find something new.<br/>
<br/>
Minor Rant:<br/>
Trying to be &quot;safe&quot; in a dangerous spot is stupid.  I hear lots of complaints<br/>
like &quot;I had 3 deaths last night and none of them were my fault, we were<br/>
fighting in the bedroom in LowerGuk and people kept training us.&quot;  Ok,<br/>
all 3 of those deaths are your fault.  When you look down and there are train<br/>
tracks under your feet, don&#39;t blame the train that runs over you for the<br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
Make it a point to get out of the way of any trains and you will get <br/>
better experience.  If someone is being stupid and dangerous around you,<br/>
it might be worth it for you to move elsewhere even though<br/>
its not your fault and you are safe there without the annoyance.<br/>
<br/>
Slow/steady xp is far better than great/risky or great/rare xp.  Around<br/>
levels 31-32 we killed lots of green placeholders so I could get to the<br/>
low blue placeholders.  Sure, a lot of monsters didn&#39;t give us xp, but<br/>
we killed them fast, and we killed the low blues fast also... to the<br/>
tune of 20% xp per hour, our group could have been killing<br/>
giants, but each one is a life and death fight, ... one thing<br/>
go wrong and you are in major trouble.  Against the low blues, we could<br/>
have several things go wrong and we were still in a very livable<br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about the game mechanics can really help you get xp, this might<br/>
not seem sporting, but if you want the xp, sometimes you&#39;ll do whatever it<br/>
 takes.  Example:  In upper guk, the stupid frogs always flee, right?  <br/>
Well, stop and think, find out where they flee to.  This takes some high<br/>
level help, but have a group of 40s attack a frog, then watch it flee.<br/>
Almost always, it will come to a point where it will just start running<br/>
back and forth, its at the end of its flee-ing path.  Camp that spot and<br/>
whenever anything flees, it will just run back and forth, viola, no<br/>
worries about runners.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to wait until everyone in the group is full mana and hits,<br/>
then you aren&#39;t getting good xp.  The best xp comes when the puller<br/>
can start to pull when the group is not close to max.  If he finds one<br/>
soon, the group is able to handle it.  If the puller has to look<br/>
for 5 minutes to find something, all the casters are still medding away<br/>
and they are that much closer for the next pull.<br/>
<br/>
Something uncamped, and unpopular for various reasons might be the<br/>
key to xp.  There are a group of seafury cyclops out in the ocean, <br/>
these are fairly LOW experience, and the loot is not great either, for<br/>
these reasons many people never bother to kill them.<br/>
But the nice thing about these is you can usually find groups fast,<br/>
and keep a group going all night long and there is always a seafury<br/>
ready to kill, these people out here with you are there for reasons.<br/>
