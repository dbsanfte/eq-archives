<div id="ygrps-yiv-478332302">Heh well the gameplay from level 1-17 or so are so diffrent from 20-50 that<br/>
is hard to go back to the boring dull of soloing for the most part and not<br/>
being in dungeons like CT or unrest and so on. Personally I find the earlier<br/>
levels extremly dull and I almost quit eq back then because it was so<br/>
boring. Once I hit 16+ I really began to have fun though and once I hit 20 I<br/>
was a little bit in awe.<br/>

&gt;Giving away banded.. doph.. the poor blacksmiths who spent all that time<br/>
&gt;learning the craft so they could be undersold by someone giveing it away.<br/>
&gt;makes me sad.  We surely do have a diffence of opinion.  10-15 levels with<br/>
&gt;the same equipment?  Wow if I were twinked like that, I could see why you<br/>
&gt;would think that the game STARTs at level 20 :)  Thats when you started<br/>
&gt;getting stuff for yourself :)  Anyway, I really think that if Verant wanted<br/>
&gt;to stop twinking then they would have done something about it, so even<br/>
&gt;though I think you are very wrong, I cannot change the world.<br/>

&gt;&gt; But are you really making their life easier by twinking them?  Are you<br/>
&gt;&gt; really enhancing the playing experience?  I know a Druid, who was givin<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it depends on the class they&#39;re playing, and the equipment<br/>
&gt;in question.  Giving a low level person full banded ot leather I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt;as a big issue, sure it&#39;ll be good for them for the next 10 or 15 levels,<br/>
&gt;but there still many upgrades to all their pieces of equipment, and many<br/>
&gt;of them come as early as the mid teens.  Frankly, I see most of my<br/>
&gt;true gaming experience in everquest as between levels 20 and 49, and<br/>
&gt;giving a player some equipment to carry them out of the newbie areas and<br/>
&gt;into the levels where people start to find regular groups and learn the<br/>
&gt;real joys of group dynamics and player interaction is definitely an<br/>
&gt;enchancement.  Spending 8 hours chunks solo hunting wisps for money so I<br/>
&gt;can scrounge the last few plat I need for banded armor is definitely not<br/>
&gt;why I paid to play EQ.<br/>
