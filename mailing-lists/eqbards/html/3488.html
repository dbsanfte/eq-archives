<div id="ygrps-yiv-404210117"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Second question is about being interupted while<br/>
&gt;playing. My only other character is a Rogue so forgive<br/>
&gt;me if my magic user references are wrong, don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt;much about them :)  When I got my heal song I took off<br/>
&gt;after a skeleton that conned white to me. I was<br/>
&gt;interupted alot. This had not really happened before<br/>
&gt;at least not this much! Is Intstrument/Singing skill<br/>
&gt;what helps prevents Bards being interupted like<br/>
&gt;Channeling is to Magic user casting? If not what is?<br/>
&gt;BTW I beat the skeleton but was not pretty *grins*<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You get interrupted if your opponent succesfully bashes<br/>
you.  Skellies, Orcs, barbarian Dervs and Bandits all<br/>
bash, and you will find it very hard to weave songs.  Hard<br/>
enough just keeping 1 going in those situations.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Third (almost done :) on getting a new song about how<br/>
&gt;long is it level wise or skill wise before you can<br/>
&gt;count on playing that song well? Is there such a time?<br/>
&gt;Another thing that surprised me was that I mess up<br/>
&gt;playing that Heal song alot more than any of the other<br/>
&gt;songs I have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Missed notes (fizzles) seem to be related to your<br/>
skill in the skill for that song (stringed for Hymm) and<br/>
the level of the song.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why It&#39;s still tough for me to get Aquatic Ayre<br/>
going, even if I&#39;m just singing it. my wind skill is only <br/>
30 something and my singing is maxed for 16 (85).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Lastly I noticed when I bought my Drums at level 5<br/>
&gt;from the wood elf vendor she sold a Mandolin and Lute<br/>
&gt;as well. Is there a difference in these two for<br/>
&gt;playing purposes? Or are they just two options for<br/>
&gt;string instruments?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only weight and price, apparently they were going to<br/>
make them subtly different, but that didn&#39;t get implemented.<br/>
