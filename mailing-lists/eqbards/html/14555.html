<div id="ygrps-yiv-320717364">Well, most of the time it doesn&#39;t seem to reattack for<br/>
me either unless the mob attacks me or one of my group<br/>
members.  In sol a i&#39;ve seen the goblins not even<br/>
re-attack even if my group members get attacked.  In<br/>
kedge keep the lancer swordfish seem to re-attack when<br/>
myself or a group member is attacked.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in a place where I can target easily I just<br/>
retarget the mob to kill and say press /pet attack<br/>
hotkey.  Or you can f8 to get nearest mob then press<br/>
/pet attack key. <br/>
