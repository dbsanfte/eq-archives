<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615267046">Funny when people say &quot;Flame away, since apparently it is all some of you<br/>
are capable of.&quot; while flaming.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some very intelligent ideas put forth here on this issue that are<br/>
not flames.  I think the part where people reacted the most to your post is<br/>
by suggesting that the people who choose to wear plate are powergamers, not<br/>
roleplayers.  Well, yes... I will rise to defend my character at this<br/>
assertion.  You don&#39;t know me.  Please don&#39;t assume and classify me based on<br/>
ONE of my ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the one person who mentioned taking the ability to wear plate away<br/>
was ASKING your opinion on it.  Please read the posts yourself.  I somehow<br/>
think that &quot;more intelligent conversation&quot; means we agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
As far as ideas go, you are entitled to yours.  I am entitled to mine.  And<br/>
as you posted yours, we&#39;re entitled to respond with ours.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, these are MY ideas here... I am quite possibly wrong.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe if more people would read the posts instead of just rising to defend<br/>
&gt;their character we would get a lot more intelligent conversation instead of<br/>
&gt;flames!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I said before all the flames &quot;Whether or not bards can ultimately wear<br/>
&gt;plate or not is moot to me, it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard so I won&#39;t&quot;<br/>
&gt;was that too difficult for you to understand???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not once did I ask that Verant remove this ability, in fact I quite clearly<br/>
&gt;stated I don&#39;t care if they remove it or not.  I choose not to wear plate<br/>
&gt;because it doesn&#39;t fit my role-playing image of a bard, period.  I also<br/>
&gt;agree with the previous post where not one person has given a valid<br/>
&gt;role-playing reason for wearing plate as a bard, although I think there are<br/>
&gt;some, but those are not the kind of posts we are seeing.  Instead we see<br/>
&gt;more, &quot;Oh yeah but...&quot; type of posts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Heaven forbid someone should make your character weaker in order to further<br/>
&gt;atmosphere or enhance the storyline.  In fact if all characters could do<br/>
&gt;everything we&#39;d all be perfectly balanced, and perfectly boring.  Flame<br/>
&gt;away, since apparently it is all some of you are capable of.<br/>

&gt;       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>
&gt;     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,<br/>
&gt;        and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>
