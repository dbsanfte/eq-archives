&gt;I remember a while back some bards on this list helpfully described a room<br/>
&gt;in Sol A to which one could pull safely.  Our guild is planning an outing<br/>
&gt;there this weekend and I would appreciate some advice on strategies and<br/>
&gt;locations for hunting there.  We are going to try to take down the predator<br/>
&gt;as well, would that be within the capability of a full group of 22-29&#39;s?<br/>
&gt;(avg level 26).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I only ever hunted from the Fur Room (as described in those emails) so I can<br/>
only talk about that. My technique for pulling was:<br/>
<br/>
Go out looking playing Elemental Rhythms, carrying a lute.<br/>
<br/>
If a wizard was in the pull I would switch to a drum, for the return trip.<br/>
<br/>
Chain to pull, then Back to Elemental for the run back to the room.<br/>
Elemental during a wizard pull really seemed to save me a lot of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Very, very often I would get stunned, you just have to breath deep and hope<br/>
your back is to the wall and wait it out, the Cleric would be waiting for<br/>
me(gotta love a really diciplined group that trusts each other)...that is<br/>
where the lute came in, the instant I would get unstunned I would start<br/>
running and fire up Largo&#39;s Binding or Lull. When I got back to the room,<br/>
start with CoD, DDD, Binding, Anthem for the tank. or when using weapons<br/>
Anthem, Elemental, Binding, Lull.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the main rule is never ever ever let any fire goblin get behind you,<br/>
they all (er, pretty sure all) backstab huge. Keep your back to the wall at<br/>
all times. You can&#39;t always help that while pulling, so make sure you are<br/>
going to have a heal waiting for you.<br/>
