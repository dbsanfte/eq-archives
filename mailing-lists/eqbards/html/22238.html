<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Change to bard song mechanics on Test! (latest from Gordon) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046167492">Just a follow-up on this &quot;song ends abruptly&quot; thing that was reported from<br/>
Test. We spent a good deal of time today looking into it, and were unable to<br/>
reproduce any spontaneous ending of the song. <br/>
The only time we were able to get a song to &quot;end abruptly&quot; was when the bard<br/>
was stunned. The message wasn&#39;t displayed to the bard, but to people around<br/>
the bard. <br/>
I know that Absor was going to look at it tonight from home on a 28.8K modem<br/>
to see if it&#39;s latency-related, but baring that we&#39;ll probably have to call<br/>
it until someone else can offer evidence on a way to reproduce it. <br/>
Here&#39;s what we know, no intentional change has been made by the programming<br/>
staff in regards to this. The programmers are also very confident that no<br/>
other changes made would create this problem. As of now, I&#39;ve only seen one<br/>
person with first-hand reports. <br/>
We&#39;ll of course be open to hearing from anyone else with insight on this<br/>
issue. <br/>

P.S  I finally got my tamborine last night LOL...but I got all the coins<br/>
myself which I consider a rather nice accomplishment (except for the coin<br/>
from EJ which my druid foraged up for me)</div>
