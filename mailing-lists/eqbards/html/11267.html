 </span></blockquote>  Don&#39;t bother, you will be decimated.  Even the lowest level ghoul<br/>
  frogs see clean through your invisibility.  Whether they attack you<br/>
  or not due to level is a different story, which is where this whole<br/>
  thread gets blurry.<br/>
<br/>
  You&#39;ve got a few situations, assuming invis is up and working:<br/>
<br/>
  MobRed cons indifferent to you, invis worked.<br/>
  MobRed cons scowls, doesnt attack, invis didnt work, nonagro mob.<br/>
         (shadowmen fit this bill, they scowl but wont kos players)<br/>
  MobRed cons scowls and attacks, invis didnt work.<br/>
  MobGreen cons indifferent to you, invis worked.<br/>
  MobGreen cons scowls, doesnt attack, your level is affecting this.<br/>
         (could also be the nonagro mob syndrome, shadowmen for example)<br/>
  MobGreen cons scowls and attacks, invis didnt work.<br/>
<br/>
  Some creatures have permanent see invis, some creatures anything<br/>
  that is not &#39;Invis to Undead&#39; doesn&#39;t work, some creatures &#39;Camo&#39;<br/>
  line of spells doesn&#39;t work, some creatures have see invis spell<br/>
  cast on them, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
  I never rely on our invis song to get me by creatures I don&#39;t<br/>
  consider living or alive.  Plus the undead scare the crap out<br/>
  of me even if they are L10.  Surround sound speakers and subwoofer,<br/>
  make those zombies jump out at ya ;)<br/>
