<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023732364">I&#39;ve only died twice in 6 levels of running up the river.  Once when I tried<br/>
to help someone that was trying to make the run without a SOW and then got<br/>
trained by about 6 spideys at once.  The second time was when I tried to use<br/>
charm against them.  <br/>
<br/>
They have a pretty small aggro radius, so if you just keep trucking up the<br/>
river with drum equipped and selo&#39;s playing and weave to avoid any you see,<br/>
you should have no problems.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Lake of Ill Omens contains plentiful mobs in all levels from <br/>
&gt; level 3-4 thru<br/>
&gt; 27-29.  You just have to hunt in different regions.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that mobs for your level would be just to the right <br/>
&gt; of where the<br/>
&gt; river hits the lake. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hrm, maybe it was just a slow spawn night...that run through the<br/>
spiders/leaches is pretty scary though, yow. They ARE agro to younuns right?<br/>
Not a one attacked me but I figured I was just lucky.<br/>
