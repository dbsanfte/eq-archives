<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667636758">Well you wouldn&#39;t want to camp EVERY time the mob is off you because:<br/>
<br/>
1.  It takes 2-5 minutes to camp each time.  Believe me, unless you are the<br/>
only viable pulling option, your friends and guildmates are going to get<br/>
VERY irritated waiting for you to come back each mob.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  We had seveal guildmembers of the high elven cleric and wood elf druid<br/>
and ranger persuasions along with us as scouts.  Two of them had little<br/>
messups.. one healed when he thought there was no aggro and the other had a<br/>
mis- /assist and they took faction hits.  They went to KOS in ONE faction<br/>
hit. <br/>
<br/>
My advice... if you don&#39;t want the faction hit, don&#39;t pull.  You&#39;re going to<br/>
get one unless you&#39;re VERY careful and VERY slow, which will annoy everyone<br/>
else.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents....<br/>

&gt; Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why can you not camp once the mob is off you? surely you can&#39;t take a<br/>
&gt; faction hit if you&#39;re not logged on? Pulling in PoG is a <br/>
&gt; breeze when you<br/>
&gt; have lightning speed. In my experience, many things have SoW <br/>
&gt; or better, and<br/>
&gt; the bard will have the best time making it back to the ambush <br/>
&gt; unharmed (or<br/>
&gt; dead).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also.. I seem to remember very few times at all that i&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; been either snared<br/>
&gt; or rooted while playing Selo&#39;s.  I don&#39;t remember actuallly <br/>
&gt; being able to<br/>
&gt; *break* them when firing up the song though.  Since this last <br/>
&gt; &quot;fix,&quot; what<br/>
&gt; has everyone discovered? Can you still be immune to movement <br/>
&gt; hindrances such<br/>
&gt; as these, or can you be caught mid-stride with a root or <br/>
&gt; snare from a long<br/>
&gt; distance caster?<br/>
