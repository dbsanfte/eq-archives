<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353630497">In EK pulling crags a few lions decided to play too. No biggie, just kill&#39;em after the crag. No sooner than this happens, a few more lions pop over the mountain beelining for our party. WTF is this we say? It&#39;s kinda funny at the time because we had no clue why all of a sudden we were being attacked by lions. Hmph, after dispatching the latest group our bard (there were 2 of us) heads out again to find a crag. He calls a train and I am getting ready to derail it with Lullaby while he picks up the other songs (Is it me or does lullaby have a LONG pulse? I am scared to drop it to twist) Over the hill he comes with no fewer than 14 lions on him. Let me tell you, that was not a pretty sight. Regardless of our levels, we ALL took some hits.<br/>
<br/>
This happened in NK with Beetles too. And today again, with every freakin orc in the zone.  Cleric calls 20 mana and I&#39;m peeing all over myself trying to kick in the speed and change instruments. DOH! Luckily I was the only one to drop. Everyone else made it to S Ro Zone in time. <br/>
<br/>
Someone clue me in on what this is? <br/>
My theory is that the hate list is being passed along via wandering orcs/lions/beetles I may have gotten a little too close to without them following me(or me outrunning them)<br/>

I think our songs are what triggers the monsters.  For what reason I am<br/>
not sure.  While wandering Befallen I passed a necro acolyte if I remember<br/>
correctly.  Being green to me it did not attack me.  So I camped the room<br/>
where the shadow knight with the second key spawns and proceeded to wait.<br/>
When she spawned I started playing Anthem as I normally do when I solo and<br/>
then I am layered with DOTs and I die a horrible death.  Now I don&#39;t<br/>
understand why everything chose that exact moment to take a run at me, but<br/>
I have noticed this for a long time and have happily enjoyed being sowed<br/>
since it doesn&#39;t cause the same number of problems that a bard&#39;s song<br/>
would.</div>
