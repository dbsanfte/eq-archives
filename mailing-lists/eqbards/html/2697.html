<br/>
My guess is that once again Verant has failed to write reasonably clear<br/>
English.<br/>
<br/>
The quest source in Kelethin says who to deliver to in Freeport.  That<br/>
person says if you want to find out about mail talk to another person in<br/>
the same room.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my guess that the second person&#39;s generic response which sounds simply<br/>
like a quest beginning is somehow supposed to tell you not to follow the<br/>
instructions you were given in Kelethin but to give the mail to someone<br/>
else there in Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
I know they mean well, but Verant&#39;s consistent inability accurately to<br/>
communicate what we&#39;re supposed to know results in considerable frustration<br/>
and wasted effort in the game.<br/>
<br/>
After this happened I sent /feedback.  I have little reason to believe that<br/>
/feedback goes anywhere but an overloaded, bottomless pit of ignored input.<br/>
<br/>
But I will undoubtedly keep spending far too many hours playing this silly<br/>
game.<br/>
