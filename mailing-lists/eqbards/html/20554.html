<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269268103">Hmmm, I recently ditched a group during corpse retreival.  But lemme explain<br/>
why & tell me if you think this was poor form.<br/>
<br/>
I was soloing as my level 7 shaman and died in Blackburrow.  Upon returning<br/>
home I hooked up with two other young barbs who also just died in<br/>
Blackburrow.  We agreed to group up for CR.  Three others joined us and I<br/>
got my corpse back first (it was right by the zone).  As I was donning my<br/>
patchwork one of the other naked barbs began fretting that someone whom he&#39;d<br/>
just consented to drag his corpse was no longer on line and that he thinks<br/>
all his banded has been stolen.  I finish looting and we head in for the<br/>
other two corpses.  The fretting barb then tells the group they died<br/>
somewhere underwater after falling down the tree.  &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; they say and<br/>
start heading for the tree.  I don&#39;t know Blackburrow THAT well so I ask if<br/>
anyone knows the way out once we&#39;re down there.  A druid in the group says<br/>
&quot;Gate&quot;.  Great, except two of our party are warriors.  Suddenly someone<br/>
shouts &quot;Train!&quot; and I and one of the warriors groupsay &quot;Zone&quot;.  The two of<br/>
us zoned, then got an earful from the druid and fretting barb who jumped<br/>
down the tree alone, and from the other naked barb and our sixth member who,<br/>
not knowing who to follow, stood around and got killed by the train.  We<br/>
zoned back in and I waited for & watched over the two who died by train as<br/>
they loot there corpses.  The fretting barb by this time had realized his<br/>
worst fears - he&#39;d been robbed completely.  Someone suggested petitioning it<br/>
but he didn&#39;t remember the name of the person he consented.  I buffed up the<br/>
four party members still on the upper level, said farewell and camped.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>

&gt; &gt; But i guess after reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; the &quot;bad mage&quot; thread, just wanted to point out that<br/>
&gt; &gt; its never a bad class,<br/>
&gt; &gt; its almost always bad players.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sooo True.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last week I joined a pickup group in Dalnirs.  We did<br/>
&gt; pretty well in the Temple room so somebody suggested<br/>
&gt; we go down to lvl 2.  As we all landed in the pool of<br/>
&gt; water, sombody got excited and pulled a nice train<br/>
&gt; into the room before we got set up.  THings got bad<br/>
&gt; and somebody said gate -- The monk and I were left to<br/>
&gt; die.  Funny thing, all four casters in the group had<br/>
&gt; to log at that point ... <br/>
&gt; 7 deaths (6 during corpse recovery) at lvl 30 sure can<br/>
&gt; ruin your night. sigh<br/>
