<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276429843">It works for me everytime, except for the Aviak merchant in South Karana.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t work on him because those Aviaks at SK have NO faction.  As for <br/>
the merchant in Oasis, are you talking about the gypsies?  Or the one in the <br/>
inns?  I think they both have faction, maybe you were on the botherline of <br/>
dubious and threathening.  So after you play the song, you are still on <br/>
dubious but almost apprehensive.  If you make it to apprehensive, they will <br/>
sell to you. But if all else fail, just sneak up to him and buy/sell.  Sneak <br/>
will make every merchant indifferent to you.  Every rogue knows this trick!<br/>

&gt;anything for me.  After reading all these messages I thought maybe it had<br/>
&gt;been fixed, so I tried it on a merchant in Oasis of Mar who conned dubious<br/>
&gt;and refused to sell to me.  I equipped my mino horn, targeted the merchant,<br/>
&gt;played the carillion, and conned her again.  Still dubious.  Right clicked<br/>
&gt;her, she still refused to sell to me.<br/>
