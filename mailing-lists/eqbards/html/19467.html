<div id="ygrps-yiv-90741405">Personally, I think folks should be rewarded for their ingenuity (not<br/>
hacking, but finding nifty bugs like that in the game).  Heck, leave it in<br/>
and name the manuever after the two that discovered it ;o)  Although they<br/>
would never believe it, some bugs can *add* to the fun of a game.<br/>
