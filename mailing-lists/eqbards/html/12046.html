<br/>
  Playing Hymm in battle at your level is like hanging a sign<br/>
  on your back that says, Please Kill Me.  You are more likely to <br/>
  receive blows in the 30s and 40s at your level.  Healing back<br/>
  12-14 points of health each round just doesnt keep up.  Let your<br/>
  healer do his job, and supply him with the mana to do it, while<br/>
  twisting in anthem or resist/dmg shield.  At level 36, Celerity<br/>
  song will make you want to twist in atkspeed again.  Anthem since<br/>
  L10 gets really, really old by L36.  But you&#39;ll love Verses of<br/>
  Celerity.<br/>
<br/>
  I tested Lullaby last night on four Gnoll Reavers (L14-ish)<br/>
<br/>
  I got no resists (as I shouldnt have).  All nod messages, and<br/>
  hardly any of those bastards stayed asleep.  They wailed on<br/>
  me the whole time.  It was if I wasn&#39;t even playing the song.<br/>
  If lullaby is this broken, I would resort to pixie/charm.<br/>
  Although that can be a full time job, if you let it be.<br/>
