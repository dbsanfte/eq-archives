<div id="ygrps-yiv-404623490">Another money for loot strategy I&#39;ve used is grouping with higher level<br/>
chars (if your 10 find someone who is 15-17) where you won&#39;t get much if any<br/>
exp from the level spread, but you will hopefully get a share of the loot to<br/>
sell, or in many cases upgrade armor/weapons with.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you have to find a group of higher level ppl that go along with<br/>
this, but for parties of say two tanks, or a tank and a magic type, having a<br/>
bard along, even a lower level one to heal and add speed (if they don&#39;t have<br/>
SOW) can be a justifiable trade for loot.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a lot of fun.. I&#39;ve visited lots of places where it was everything<br/>
conned red to me, but white or blue to my party mates. It&#39;s also been a<br/>
great way to stand back, not fight, and just weave songs.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just my views here (still off topic, but all us Bards seem to dabble in<br/>
&gt; &gt;trade skills anyway):<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;After fighting my way up to level 11, mostly solo, and barely getting<br/>
&gt; &gt;enough plat to afford my songs at each level, I was told that I should<br/>
&gt; &gt;work on trade skills to make the money I needed.  Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>
&gt; &gt;good then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You got some poor advice.  There is no magical road to money in trade<br/>
&gt; skills.  There are a few trade skills where you can make a profit, but<br/>
&gt; normally require hundreds of plat and many hours to build up your skill<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; [trade skill failures clipped]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Forget trade skills.  You are never going to get rich there.  You need to<br/>
&gt; kill mobs with decent loot.  The two legged mobs almost always have better<br/>
&gt; loot than the four legged ones.  Two great areas for your level are<br/>
&gt; Blackburrow and Crushbone.  Since you are in Freeport, you might not want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; travel that far.  Instead there is Befallen and all the Derv camps in WC,<br/>
&gt; North and South Ro.  You will get rusty weapons, and pieces of armor,<br/>
&gt; sometimes even a bronze weapon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Collect every single thing from the corpses to sell.  You may want to<br/>
invest<br/>
&gt; in some backpacks.  Once you are way overloaded, sell everything.  It is<br/>
&gt; important to find a merchant that will give you a good price.  With Selos,<br/>
&gt; you can run a bit farther for better prices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After an hour or so, you will will have your bp&#39;s full of junk.  It will<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; sell for about 1-3gp.  But if you have 20 items, that can come out to<br/>
3-6pp.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes you will get lucky and find a bronze weapon that sells for<br/>
1-3pp.<br/>
&gt; Play for 3-4 hours and you can earn near 20pp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Frankly, it looks like Verant wants lower level folks to be dependent on<br/>
&gt; &gt;handouts from higher level folks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How can you possibly believe that?  My bard never got a handout.  At level<br/>
&gt; 13 I have full banded, a Combine LS, and 10pp in the bank.  For all of us<br/>
&gt; who started from day one, we had no one to give us handouts.  Don&#39;t insult<br/>
&gt; us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I find it rather sad that I can barely<br/>
&gt; &gt;get necessities on my own each level up to level 10 and now that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;level 11, I really need banded to survive and I can&#39;t afford it, nor does<br/>
&gt; &gt;it look like I will ever afford it soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I assume that you did waste some of your money learning all the trade<br/>
&gt; skills.  That is a hole you will have to work out of.  But with hard work,<br/>
&gt; you can overcome this.  Just concentrate on getting one piece of banded at<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
