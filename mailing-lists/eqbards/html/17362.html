<div id="ygrps-yiv-101046799">Well, at level 35 there&#39;s not really a piercer that&#39;s better for a rogue to<br/>
use.  Keep in mind, rogues only need to have a piercer in their primary hand<br/>
to be able to backstab, the off hand has nothing to do with it.  If I was a<br/>
level 35 rogue, I&#39;d certainly use an ebw in my off hand.  Lots of rogues use<br/>
yaks in their off hands too until they get planar gear.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Question on Loot and Classes <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Last night I ended up camping the maid and butler in MM. Our severely<br/>
overpowered group consisted of 2 bards (35), 1 rogue (35), 1 warrior (35), 1<br/>
druid (35) and 1 shaman (33). During the night we were fortunate to see the<br/>
Butler once, and he actually had the fang for us. I didn&#39;t win the lotto. :┬¼<br/>
(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, our rogue said that he needed the EBW too. I was wondering what all<br/>
of your opinions on the matter were. I would love some ammo for my side of<br/>
the argument that there are other things he should be going after. Of<br/>
course, if I&#39;m wrong, then I guess that means I&#39;ll be in MM a looooooong<br/>
time.<br/>

Eep, we need 8 fangs as a group?<br/>
<br/>
*runs off to cry*<br/>
