&gt;....  Sure, in combat you&#39;re just going to<br/>
&gt; sit back and do absolutely nothing because having to pull stuff off you<br/>
&gt; would make you a liability, but your utility songs are still extremely<br/>
&gt; useful when you&#39;re naked.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you get a bit higher _as a bard_ you&#39;re going to discover the joys<br/>
of being on a mob&#39;s hate list before you even play a song. I was res&#39;d<br/>
back into the tunnels of Sol B shortly before I stopped actively playing<br/>
my bard, and dispite the fact that I was off down the tunnel quite a way<br/>
when someone trained our group with some bats and LDC&#39;s, and a LDC made a<br/>
special trip down the tunnel to hit me with blood boil and kill me<br/>
dispite being under assault from warriors and wizards in the rest of the<br/>
party.<br/>

&gt; &gt; that&#39;s how it always worked on our server with our groups.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I read your argument, and to me you just basically said &quot;I would<br/>
&gt; not choose to be bound outside a dungeon because that&#39;s how it always<br/>
&gt; worked.&quot;  I fail to see the logic in that.<br/>
&gt; 	I agree, that&#39;s how it works, no one is disputing that.  But is<br/>
&gt; that the best way?  No.  If you were bound right outside the dungeon, <br/>
&gt; you&#39;d be assisting with corpse retrieval with mana song all the way down.<br/>
&gt; The only reason that&#39;s the way it works now is because you cannot be<br/>
&gt; bound right outside the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or maybe that&#39;s how it is because people have tried your idea and found<br/>
it not to work.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; At higher levels an unarmored and weakly armed player is more of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; liability than a bonus when doing corpse recovery. I was in a 2 group<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Certainly not.  You get them a decent weapon (magician summoned<br/>
&gt; weapons are actually quite good) and they stay off their taunt button, and<br/>
&gt; they are still a very signifigant source of damage, with enough hit points<br/>
&gt; where a cleric can keep them alive if they pull stuff on them for some<br/>
&gt; reason.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; 	Last time I walked into Lower Guk... A group at the zone line, a<br/>
&gt; group at the bedroom, a group at the gibs, a group in the assassin&#39;s room,<br/>
&gt; a group in the savant room, a group at the magi, a group at frenzied.  And<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s just the undead side... * sigh *<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, it&#39;s a totally different game now than the one I played, and I<br/>
think I liked the one I played a lot more.<br/>
