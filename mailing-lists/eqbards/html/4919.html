<div id="ygrps-yiv-641312268">I have a couple of questions about this magic item.  First, according to<br/>
screenshots on a couple EQ sites, it says the Guise is for bards and rogues<br/>
only.  Is this still true?  I ran into a barbarian once who had one on.  He<br/>
used it to make him smaller so he could get into tight places.  I&#39;m almost<br/>
certain he was a warrior (I did a /who on him).  Second question is the NO<br/>
DROP flag.  The screenshots I saw listed it as a NO DROP item.  I don&#39;t have<br/>
much experience with NO DROP items so not certain how this works.  If<br/>
someone has one can I buy it from them?  What if someone who can&#39;t equip it<br/>
loots it off the creature that drops it? Does that mean it is forever<br/>
unusable?  Last question, if it can be sold/traded, what is the fair price<br/>
for it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
