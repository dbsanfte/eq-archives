<div id="ygrps-yiv-682775027">As long as you&#39;re looking for experience and not a plentiful supply of loot,<br/>
the Lake of Ill Omen is a wonderful place to hunt in your mid-20&#39;s and up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been there since 22, primarily soloing since my play time is restircted<br/>
to the odd half-hour/hour here and there.  Outside the Sarnak Fortress is a<br/>
nice spot to pull Conscripts, Legionnaires and the casting Adherant.<br/>
There&#39;s a problem with hatelist propagation with Sarnaks in the zone -<br/>
you&#39;ll get seemingly unwarranted faction hits from time to time. It appears<br/>
that the hatelist is being passed on from mob to roaming mob - eliminate<br/>
those runners, and make sure when you pull a caster it follows you... too<br/>
many times I&#39;ve seen the puller in a group taunt a caster and when it<br/>
doesn&#39;t come after him, he&#39;ll switch targets to a meleer.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the fortress courtyard, there&#39;s nice spot to the left of the entrance<br/>
on a steep slope which leads to the fortress walls.  I sat with a group<br/>
there the other night and we had a *constant* supply of Sarnaks... the<br/>
experience was phenomenal. We had an occasional unsolicited aggro, but for<br/>
the most part this was a very safe and lucrative area to pull to.  Loot was<br/>
mostly coin and the occasional gem.  We had one Lego that came equipped with<br/>
a nice looking brass coloured 2H axe, but which proved to be fairly mediocre<br/>
for the level range.<br/>
<br/>
I made 26 last night soloing Goblin Warriors at the ruins near the lake to<br/>
the left of the zone.  All-instrument against two or three warriors is<br/>
wonderful. :)  I immediately memmed Fear and tested it with Chains against a<br/>
Conscript.  The beastie fled and Chains  s l o w e d  it down, but it was<br/>
annoying having to swing, run forward, swing, run forward etc.  Once it<br/>
moved out of my &#39;safe spot&#39;, I let Screech stop and waited for the mob to<br/>
run back before giving it another pulse of fear.  Whittling it down to about<br/>
50% health stopped it dead in it&#39;s tracks once I Feared/Chained.<br/>
<br/>
So my tactic for now is:<br/>
<br/>
 o Chain mob from a distance and it moves slowly towards you, allowing you<br/>
to get back to your &#39;safe spot&#39;, re-Chaining as necessary.<br/>
 o Screech.<br/>
 o Melee with Jonthan&#39;s or play DDD with a horn equipped.<br/>
 o Pulse Chain before it breaks and immediately pulse Screech unless mob<br/>
gets outside your safe spot.<br/>
 o Repeat.<br/>
<br/>
In all the fear/chaining I did last night, I never got one resist from fear<br/>
but had a couple of chain resists, which is the way I like it. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Sylly, Lyrnia, Galtin and Rokenn (amongst others) for the tips on<br/>
Chains and Screech.  I&#39;ll revisit the Charm thread as I get closer to my<br/>
next DING. :)<br/>
