<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Time for a new topic.  One of the most lamentable losses for the Minstrel<br/>
&gt;Bard is the lack of an effective way to &quot;sing&quot;.  Many people like to spam<br/>
&gt;using socials (as a cheap way to learn languages), but there is truly no<br/>
&gt;efficient way to do this with songs.  So, currently, we Minstrels are stuck<br/>
&gt;with hand-typing if we want to sing, and it&#39;s just not all that effective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From the perspective of a bard who has perhaps sang more than any other in<br/>
Norrath (probably more than twenty hours real time doing concerts and<br/>
songs), let me tell you that I have been feedbacking a request for<br/>
something like this for a LONG time (since P3). Granted, there is limited<br/>
utility for this, in that it only helps those who RP mostly, and after that<br/>
fact, a /sing command would only help RPers who play bards.<br/>
<br/>
Leading The Soerbaird, I&#39;ve witnessed many others struggle through this<br/>
process, and I can honestly say it is only our passion from barding that<br/>
keeps our hands attached to our wrists sometimes. (After a hour-long<br/>
concert, let me give you a NEW definition of cramp!)<br/>
<br/>
After MUCH thought on this dilemma, I have come to a couple of conclusions:<br/>
<br/>
1) I like the process being somewhat manual. Typing each line does a couple<br/>
of things: it helps to simulate some of the difficulties of live<br/>
performance (typos as missed notes) and keeps every kewldood and their<br/>
brother from spamming us with Marilyn Manson lyrics.<br/>
<br/>
2) If we&#39;re going to solicit a command from Verant, we need to do something<br/>
that benefits more than just a niche of bards. My proposal (which I<br/>
feedback nearly daily now) is that a new chat command box be added to the<br/>
chat command window (where you select languages and such). This new command<br/>
would be an emote verb, and would work kind of like the /tell does there<br/>
now. Here&#39;s how it works: in the box you would type a verb (sings, mutters,<br/>
whispers, muses, etc...) and then, you could check a box next to it to turn<br/>
it on. Then, when using normal speech, rather than &#39;says&#39; you would see the<br/>
verb you entered. For example, I type &#39;sings&#39; in the box. Then I type &#39;Mary<br/>
had a little lamb&#39;, just like I would normally say that to you. What you<br/>
see is...<br/>
<br/>
Jythri sings, &#39;Mary had a little lamb&#39;<br/>
<br/>
This allows the singer to focus on the core text, without having to type<br/>
&#39;/em sings, &#39;&#39;. That gets old very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the script idea goes, it bears some consideration. Coming from a<br/>
MUD background I found myself almost debilitated by the lack of a good<br/>
macro or scripting system. ( I used to have no less than 100 emotes queued<br/>
up to keyboard shortcuts to help with RPing my characters. Just call me the<br/>
PuppetMaster.) But like I said earlier, for barding, I really like the<br/>
manual input. Hehe. I have to be able to sing on the spot? How else would I<br/>
sufficiently taunt dwarves? *grins*<br/>
<br/>
Welcoming your feedbac...<br/>
