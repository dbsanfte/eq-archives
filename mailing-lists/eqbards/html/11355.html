<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549992230"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just a point.   I got my Plat Ruby Veil for a little less than 500pp.  <br/>
&gt; I had 4 rubies on hand, which I gave to him for it.  Which amounts to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  You got the better deal on that by far.  Four rubies at the best<br/>
  faction/cha is 524 pp, btw.  Most enchanters I know will go with the:<br/>
 <br/>
  I&#39;ll give you a plat bar and a star ruby, on a success I will<br/>
  pay you for your efforts.  But then you take on the cost of<br/>
  failures.  105pp for a plat bar, 68pp for a star ruby, that <br/>
  gives you 5 attempts for the enchanter to be successful before<br/>
  you could of just paid them 900-1000pp to do it.  With recent<br/>
  changes to jewelcraft, I hear it&#39;s near impossible to create<br/>
  mid-high level platinum items without certain failures.<br/>
  <br/>
  So if you get lucky, and the enchanter takes your stuff (173pp)<br/>
  and succeeds first try how much do you pay them?  And what on<br/>
  further attempts if they fail?<br/>
<br/>
  Ooops, I forgot... Fozzle is a skill(200) jeweller too.<br/>
<br/>
  He failed 6 times in a row on a plat ruby veil, ouch!<br/>
  (131 + 105) * 6 , eeeek.<br/>
<br/>
  You will find 1k pp is very firm on Innoruuk.  You may get it<br/>
  for 900pp or people may ask 1100pp.  Not sure what the going<br/>
  price is.  I paid 1k for mine, many many months ago.  Unless<br/>
  you have friends in high places, are good buddies with a <br/>
  skill(200) enchanter, or find some extremely incredible deal<br/>
  such as Steven - you will end up paying the piper.<br/>
