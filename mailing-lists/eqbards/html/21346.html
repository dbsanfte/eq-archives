<div id="ygrps-yiv-694463250">There are places where it just isn&#39;t possible to use Charm as Crowd Control.<br/>
High Blues are basically uncharmable.  I have yet to see charm do anything<br/>
but aggro me to death in Skyfire for example.<br/>
<br/>
Also - as far as people leaving - I think it has more to do with the way<br/>
Verant has handled the issue than whether they are having fun without<br/>
Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
If they would come out and say &quot;Sorry, we have truly ignored you for 10<br/>
months, and in looking at the issue now we see no reason to change it&quot;.  If<br/>
the original lullaby is over-powered now - it was over-powered now.  There<br/>
was nothing to test - there was no action to do - other making a decision.<br/>
<br/>
I find them less than honest, extremely arrogant, unwilling to admit<br/>
mistakes and refusing to ever apologize (except in very weak way - Ester<br/>
excepted however).<br/>
<br/>
I have decided not to quit simply because of my friends in my guild and on<br/>
my server.  I have little to no respect for Verant in the regards of<br/>
customer service and understanding the dynamic of the game they created.<br/>
<br/>
While I will continue to pay my $10/month - I will probably never buy<br/>
another game from them.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents!<br/>

<br/>
i&#39;m assuming you mean that egroups thing and paying stuff, heh.<br/>
<br/>
as to the verant &#39;&#39;changes&#39;&#39;, amazingly enough, i didn&#39;t notice any changes<br/>
in how my bard played with respect to lullaby over the last 10 months or so.<br/>
actually, my bard is much more powerful now than he was 10 moths ago.<br/>
chants<br/>
allow him to solo, higher charm allows him to crowd control mobs over 39 and<br/>
solo charm kiting to 50+.<br/>
<br/>
so there&#39;s no reason to quit for me, i am having as much or more fun playing<br/>
my bard<br/>
as ever.  did crowd control with charm in karnors last night, kept 4 mobs<br/>
busy<br/>
(charmed a skeletal warlord who had 3 drolvargs beating on him) while my<br/>
group took out a couple others.  unfortunately the warlord poofed when he<br/>
died, but<br/>
his sacrifice was worth it, Thanks Skeletal_Warlord!!!!<br/>
