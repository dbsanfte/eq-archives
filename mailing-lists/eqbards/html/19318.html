<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961400480">Let me ask this... other than the trade windows, how is the Destroy <br/>
button and droping action any different?  Did they not set a flag on <br/>
this to bring up a window?(If the option is selected)  Is this not a <br/>
client side option?  You guys are making this seem more complicated <br/>
than it is.  How does it effect the entire game engine?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can see this option.  Trade/Drop items: On, Off, Confirm.  <br/>
They have already done it similarly with the destroy button.<br/>

&gt; &gt;So be it.  Personally, I hate opening trade windows because of the <br/>
&gt; &gt;space between the Melee/Inventory slots.  Besides, remember, this <br/>
&gt; &gt;will be a client side personal choice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; umm, what makes you think that any of these hooks are set up on the<br/>
&gt; client side? </span></blockquote></div>
