<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-69561511">The scale master only drops red scales.  While there are rumors on some<br/>
sites (Warrior Site I believe) that he has dropped white or green scales -<br/>
it has never been confirmed.  There are detailed discussions of this on The<br/>
Concert Hall&#39;s Epic  Forum at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm7">http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm7</a><br/>

My guild isn&#39;t Gor capable yet - so I&#39;m planning on leading a Vox Raid with<br/>
that scale defaulting to me.  I had a long discussion with my guild as to<br/>
whether this is considered acceptable (since I can&#39;t actually fight Vox) -<br/>
and it was agreed that it was acceptable for the scale to default to me if I<br/>
lead the raid.<br/>

How are people getting the white scales on your server?  Is anyone killing<br/>
the scale master?  On my server Vox and Nagafen are killed within hours of<br/>
poping.  The white scale is defently the HUGE bottle neck on my server.  How<br/>
about yours?<br/>

eq again.<br/>
