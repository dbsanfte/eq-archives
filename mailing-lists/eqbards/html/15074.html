<b>Subject:</b> What about the lvl 24 song? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-928710099">Now that they fixed the clouding song...<br/>
<br/>
Wat was the plan for the lvl 24 see invis song?<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody remember the discussion?  Is this just another useless song that they are going to expect us to deal with...<br/>
<br/>
I swear, when does NWN come out?<br/>
