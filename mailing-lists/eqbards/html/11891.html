&gt;I&#39;ve heard (and don&#39;t know if its true) that some servers use bards in the<br/>
&gt;plane of fear to do the pulling.<br/>
&gt;Any truth to this?  If so, what is done?<br/>

one of our many mr songs. Since i never got feared, stuned, blinded,<br/>
snared, or rooted i could safely pull stuff in the pof that would get many<br/>
others killed. As an xtra bonus, if a worry wraith/jello cube dispelled my<br/>
sow you have the safety of selo&#39;s to fall back on. I even pulled the fire<br/>
castle sometimes, though i disliked doing that cause 9 harm touches even<br/>
with 250+ mr puts a kink in your day. <br/>
<br/>
But now... my bard dislikes even setting a foot into the plane of fear with<br/>
the cazic dt&#39;s, the reason being that bards are such efficient transfers of<br/>
agro. With one pulse... everybody is added to cazic&#39;s dt list it seems.<br/>
Going solo and pulling would solve a lot of these problems, but the people<br/>
buffing/healing you would still be added to the agro list of cazic. <br/>
<br/>
One last thing to be aware of is autopull. Autopull used to be great but<br/>
you DEFINATLY do not want to be using it now. Autopulling now just ensures<br/>
that cazic starts DTing people at random much sooner than later.</div>
