<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564479920">I know what you mean... I&#39;ve never been in a group that&#39;s tried to &quot;screw&quot;<br/>
me, but I&#39;ve been in bad groups who had NO CLUE about what they were doing<br/>
(&quot;Play the jig, it regenerates mana&quot;; &quot;Why are you playing more than one<br/>
song?&quot;; &quot;Why aren&#39;t you playing songs that buff the party [when i&#39;m playing<br/>
npc damage songs AND weaving some party buff songs]&quot;; or they do dumb things<br/>
like pulling creatures that are WAY too hard for the group without telling<br/>
us; or clerics who don&#39;t save some of their mana for healing and just blast<br/>
it away and we die because of it.... the list can go on)... Anyway, I<br/>
usually group with guildmates or people I know as well - just plain safer<br/>
that way!!<br/>

&gt; To bad me blacklisting someone in my book doesn&#39;t mean anything ;-).  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; got a list of about 10 KS&#39;ers and 2 &quot;Ninja&quot; looters.  I tend to only party<br/>
&gt; with people I know or people from my guild now.  I hate that bad taste in<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; mouth when I get screwed. </span></blockquote></div>
