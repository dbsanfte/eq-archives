<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036334696"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I finally got my xalgoz fang (4th attempt).  For turning them into the necro<br/>
&gt;frog, most people have told me to use wolf form.  However this would require<br/>
&gt;me dragging some friendly druid out of his way...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SO is it possible to use sneak or charm?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t try to charm him or you will find yourself running to the zone with a<br/>
pissed off necromancer on your tail.  When I did my fang first I was<br/>
playing my level 52 wizard.  I was dubious to Xalgoz but he talked to me<br/>
and gave me the quest.  So I turned in my parts and he said he would not<br/>
aid beings like me.  I got a GM to restore my parts since Durgoz actually<br/>
did give me the quest text.<br/>
I then brought a 49th Enchanter along with me to charm him.  Even though<br/>
Durgoz was green to the both of us he resisted the charm, started attacking<br/>
the enchanter.  Resisted every root that I attempted to cast on him.  I<br/>
killed his pet.  He resisted every nuke I put on him, continued to resist<br/>
charm and mez from the enchanter.<br/>
The fight ended when both the enchanter and I found ourselves on the other<br/>
side of the zone line, quite beat up and licking our wounds.  All we manage<br/>
to do was to kill his pet.  I&#39;m sure he is probably killable with melee<br/>
methods but don&#39;t try that charm stuff on him, he dosen&#39;t like it. :)<br/>
