<div id="ygrps-yiv-211390421">I would be interested in helping with such a guild, maybe this guild in time<br/>
could be seen of as Bards of old, helpful and knowledgeable of the area<br/>
around them, and willing to travel and explore the world.  maybe not<br/>
restricted to just bards but those of a like mind.  A guild of people who<br/>
are willing to find lost corpses and who are against trains and the like.<br/>
If you all are interested than I am all for it.<br/>
<br/>
What would be a charter and a constitution of such a group?  and how would<br/>
its laws be enforced.  would we only help out good chars and races or would<br/>
we be neutral to the world&#39;s hatreds and help any travelers?<br/>

&gt;&gt;And if you ever succeed in discovering a Guild that promotes travel,<br/>
&gt;&gt;adventure, samaritan acts and just plain fun, please be sure to let us<br/>
&gt;&gt;know - I know I would be interested, as I am sure others would be as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We could start one.  Consider a guild, perhaps of bards or perhaps allowing<br/>
&gt;other classes, whose primary purpose is to help one another and others.<br/>
&gt;That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t run a business at a reasonable profit, but<br/>
&gt;members of the guild should be known for acts of generosity and kindness<br/>
&gt;rather than arrogance and self serving.  No reflection on other guilds<br/>
&gt;intended.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The idea would be that anyone seeing the name of that guild would know the<br/>
&gt;bearer could be trusted implicitly and appealed to for possible help.  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;like to see it allow worthies of other classes and any race, but maintain a<br/>
&gt;flavor of bardic oversight and origination.  It should have relatively<br/>
&gt;independent chapters on all servers where people of good will wanted to<br/>
&gt;join.  The only membership fee is a pledge, well-kept, to good will and<br/>
&gt;honorable behavior.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We could name it, say, &quot;Song of &lt;something&gt;&quot;  like Harmony, Service, Aid,<br/>
&gt;or such.  I like &quot;Song of Service.&quot;  If you&#39;re in trouble, call out SoS.<br/>
