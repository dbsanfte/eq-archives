&gt; &gt;Actually there&#39;s a very easy way to &quot;fix&quot; this. After any weapon&#39;s special<br/>
&gt; &gt;effect goes off bard songs get hosed. To fix it just hit any song 2 or more<br/>
&gt; &gt;times until you get the &quot;You have not recovered yet&quot; message and that will<br/>
&gt; &gt;fix it. The stuck icon on the screen will wear off and you can then cast<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tried this and it didn&#39;t help one bit.  What exactly are<br/>
&gt; you doing?  Are you using hotkeys or the mouse?  I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; try it with the mouse.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I managed to put myself into this wedged state without a<br/>
magical weapon by hitting my song hotkeys too quickly.  So I&#39;m<br/>
sure doing so can unstick you (though I don&#39;t know how to do<br/>
it consistently).  Try hitting your song hotkeys really<br/>
quickly for a while.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a simple programming issue that&#39;s causing the problem.<br/>
The client and server get out of synch.  The client thinks a<br/>
song isn&#39;t playing, the server says it is.  You try to play a<br/>
song, the server says you&#39;re already playing.  In the opposite<br/>
case (what happened to me), you try to stop playing a song,<br/>
the server says you&#39;re already stopped.  They just need to add<br/>
something to resynch the client and server.<br/>
