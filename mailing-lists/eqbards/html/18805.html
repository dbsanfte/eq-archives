<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-301819702">ok true, but i didn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t do it.  i meant why in the world would<br/>
you want to =)  in other words, if you go to kedge neither the bard nor<br/>
anyone else there is going to be using the acquatic ayre as a primary means<br/>
of breathing.  it&#39;s gonna be EB, or a fishbone/singing gaunts with the song<br/>
memmed as a backup in case the EB&#39;er dies, or for getting ressed, etc.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I disagree with this.  Although I get an enduring breath <br/>
&gt; whenever doing<br/>
&gt; underwater fighting if this song effect drops you still have <br/>
&gt; your whole<br/>
&gt; breath bar to go through before you start drowning so even <br/>
&gt; accounting for a<br/>
&gt; normal number of mixed notes you could do your 3 song <br/>
&gt; rotation and mix this<br/>
&gt; one in as the third song every second time and you&#39;d be fine. <br/>
&gt;  It worked<br/>
&gt; once for me on a corpse recovery, but I do get enduring <br/>
&gt; breath because its a<br/>
&gt; little too high stress for me. :) </span></blockquote></div>
