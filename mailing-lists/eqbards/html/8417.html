<div id="ygrps-yiv-182850323">Count me in on the &quot;running with Zixors&quot; event, date & time permitting.  But<br/>
perhaps we should use &quot;Lemming&quot; in our names instead?<br/>
<br/>
Another thought, if we can&#39;t make it all the way to Lavastorm, is to play<br/>
around on the chessboard.  We could all run around complaining about how<br/>
tough the life of a pawn is until some high level baddy comes along and<br/>
swats us.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if we all name ourselves Dolphin1, Dolphin2, etc, we could chase the<br/>
boats leaving for Antonica.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to have diffent characters from the same account in different<br/>
guilds?  If so, if someone could start up a guild on whichever server we<br/>
have the event on, and call this guild &quot;Lollypop&quot;, we all join it, and as<br/>
representatives of the Lollypop guild we go on a quest to rescue Dorothy.   <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;d better stop now...<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
