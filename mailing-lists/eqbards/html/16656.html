<b>Subject:</b> Chain/Bellow/Root Question. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982015715">Can Chain or Bellow break root on Party members?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I know Bellow is a DD but the other day I got rooted and bellowed<br/>
myself to get free, I ran but kept missing notes on Selos and so I died.<br/>
Strangely however, I got the message &quot;You have been slain by Tszaaz!&quot;. Now,<br/>
I know that it was in fact stupidity that got me killed,  but I have to<br/>
assume that I struck the killing blow, and I have no idea how I did this<br/>
except by some sort of DoT.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, 26,Povar</div>
