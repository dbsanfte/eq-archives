 </span></blockquote>There is a precedent for this.  The original warrior armor<br/>
from PoF was mislabeled so that a variety of classes<br/>
(including bards) could use it.  Being warrior armor, the<br/>
stats were way better than anything available to those<br/>
classes.  They fixed it so only warriors could equip it, there<br/>
was a huge outcry, they changed it back, and created some new<br/>
warrior armor.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, if an item is no-drop (so trades are a non-issue)<br/>
and it&#39;s obvious the benefit is due to a bug (guise, warrior<br/>
PoF armor), then I say fix it and who cares about the<br/>
complaints from those who would exploit obvious bugs.<br/>
Apparently Verant felt differently.  People say making a<br/>
previously useful item useless is bad, which it is.  But now<br/>
we have a situation where everyone who got the item early has<br/>
a permanent and unmatchable advantage over everyone else.  I<br/>
have to wonder if Verant inadvertantly chose the greater of<br/>
two evils here.<br/>
