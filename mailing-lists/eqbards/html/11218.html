<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250609102">I have found Unrest undead to be unique in the world of undead.  It is<br/>
possible to invis past them, unless a hag has cast see invis on them.<br/>
<br/>
A brief trip to lower guk dead side will set anyone straight that Clouding<br/>
does NOT invis to undead.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would be better to call Unrest a house of Dead, and proclaim<br/>
that Clouding will invis you to the living and the dead, but not the<br/>
undead.<br/>
