<div id="ygrps-yiv-990512267">In early beta, the Bard sang his/her song to everyone around them.<br/>
<br/>
As has been mentioned before:  This is not true.  This occured in late/mid<br/>
Beta 3 and lasted for about 3 weeks.  It was a bug and it took them a while<br/>
to figure out what they broke when they modified our songs.  This was also<br/>
during the time when they broke the music in EQ.  Actually they broke ALL<br/>
sounds in EQ.  Everyone had to disable their sound cards to play.<br/>
<br/>
Bards were fixed later on.  A lot of people who joined beta during that<br/>
mixup were under the false impression that that was the way bards had been<br/>
all along.  It wasn&#39;t.  I started playing during Beta 2.  My bard always<br/>
sang only to her group except when they caused that bug.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this puts a stop to this misconception ;)<br/>
