<b>Subject:</b> Bards N Plate and people&#39;s opinions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-528292470">From what I&#39;ve seen the bards in Everquest are nothing like the &quot;bards&quot; of<br/>
the celtic tribes as you describe them here.  The bards of everquest travel,<br/>
sing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>
which you said the celts were not.  I could handle bards wearing chain in a<br/>
roleplay situation, however, not plate.  This is my opinion, and I feel both<br/>
sides need to be expressed with minimal sarcasm (which is why i appreciated<br/>
that post, not nearly as much sarcasm).  It&#39;s understandable that most of<br/>
you want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>
argument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>
bards.  This is not to say that I&#39;ll not wear plate, because I&#39;m not THAT<br/>
commited to convictions.  -=) <br/>

&gt; Okay that&#39;s it I&#39;ve about had it my fellows of song.  It&#39;s time for a<br/>
&gt; reality check.  I roleplay.. the fact that I have a bard since day one<br/>
&gt; release and am only level 13 attests to that.  Infact I have on more<br/>
&gt; then one occasion parited with groups above my exp gain level for the<br/>

&gt; Unlike many I&#39;m willing to bet I also sing sea chanties on boatrides,<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m tired of seeing this roleplay plate mail talk and quite a few others,<br/>
