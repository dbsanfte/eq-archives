 </span></blockquote>Did they actually RELEASE these or is the 6.18 driver off a &quot;leak&quot; site?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They are actual official Detonator 3 RELEASE drivers which, with certain<br/>
other games like Unreal Tournament, Quake III, MDK 2 etc, have shown a<br/>
performance increase upwards of 50% both in OpenGL and Direct3D.<br/>
<br/>
I found no problems with 6.18 and EverQuest.  Mind you, EQ doesn&#39;t exactly<br/>
push the average computer to the limit.  The driver junkies are usually the<br/>
ones trying to squeeze every last fps out of UT and Q3.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with &quot;If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot;... something the Verant Spell<br/>
team have yet to learn (he said, bringing things slightly back on topic ;)<br/>
<br/>
Slyde: apologies if I assume anything I shouldn&#39;t, but did you ensure that<br/>
the 5.33 drivers were completely removed before installing 6.18?  Which<br/>
card/cpu/mobo combo do you have?<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, if you&#39;re only playing EQ, stick to 5.33.  I noticed *zero*<br/>
difference with the new drivers. :)</div>
