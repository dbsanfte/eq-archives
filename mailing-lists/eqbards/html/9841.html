&gt; a few words here...<br/>
&gt; bard= jack of all trades, master of none<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dispite the fact that this tired old adage is dragged out every time<br/>
this debate comes up, did you ever stop to actually think what jack<br/>
means? Up until it&#39;s use on this list it used to mean relatively good at<br/>
something as compared to true master. Are you claiming that bard&#39;s<br/>
foraging and hiding skills could be called relatively good? If so, would<br/>
that be relative to someone who had none at all or to someone who was<br/>
relatively bad?<br/>
<br/>
As EQ has seen fit to redefine master as 101 out of a possible 200-255<br/>
skill it&#39;s important we have a clear understanding of relatively good.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be interesting to get a list poll up to see how many<br/>
bards on the list actually use forage or hide, or even have them in<br/>
their hotkeys. We&#39;d have to have a seperate section for wood elf bards<br/>
as the wood elf natural cap is actually 10 higher than the default<br/>
bard&#39;s (hmm, another contradiction to the jack of foraging idea)<br/>
