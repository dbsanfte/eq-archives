100% deferral to snare is not the optimal solution.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But don&#39;t you see, that very same argument works against snare<br/>
just as well as chain.  If all it takes to deal with a runner<br/>
is a nuke and a DoT, then it doesn&#39;t matter if you overwrite<br/>
snare with chain.<br/>

&gt; What level mobs are you fighting?  In my experience it is a rule, not<br/>
&gt; exception.  Anything above level 35 or so will tend to break chains at<br/>
&gt; random times and not last 3 ticks... ever.  My charisma is about 125 and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it sticks reliably (at L48-49) on the froglok king,<br/>
bok and guk knights, bats, beetles, LDCs.  I&#39;ve even used it<br/>
on ice giants and seafury cyclopses for the slowdown effect.  <br/>
The only things that break out frequently are stuff that&#39;s<br/>
white or higher, and stuff that has magic resist buffs.  One<br/>
of the low-blue named gnolls in Paw gave me problems until I<br/>
hit him three times with my pumice stone (if I&#39;d known this<br/>
would be a problem, I would&#39;ve had cancel magic memorized).<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, you claim you almost never use chain,<br/>
deferring to druid/ranger snarers and shaman/enchanter speed<br/>
debuffers.  On the other hand, you speak as if with expertise<br/>
about how reliable chain is against high level mobs.  Do you<br/>
see the credibility problem here?<br/>
<br/>
A lot of us have used Chain every day as our only method of<br/>
runner control.  It is not as unreliable as you make it out to<br/>
be.  I&#39;d prefer to have a snarer, but if I don&#39;t it&#39;s no big<br/>
deal most of the time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ve had it wear off immediately from a L2 beetle.  It<br/>
happens from time to time.  95% of the time in my experience,<br/>
it works fine.<br/>

everything with magic resist up the wazoo.  The same is<br/>
somewhat true in Sol A with all the wandering wizards.<br/>

&gt; wish!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try the live side.  Most people avoid the maze and noble/king<br/>
area for some reason (probably so set into the camp mentality<br/>
that having to run around confusing corridors is terrifying<br/>
for them).<br/>
