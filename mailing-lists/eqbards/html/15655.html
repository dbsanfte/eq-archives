<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-700363327">For me, it seems that charm (tell it to attack), then Anthem, damage<br/>
shield (or hymn), then *brief* pause, charm again.  The brief pause is about<br/>
1 sec or less, but yes, I can&#39;t keep all 3 songs going in perfect harmony<br/>
like normal :(<br/>
<br/>
Of couse my having a pet that does 3x as much damage as me makes up for it<br/>
=)<br/>
<br/>
So yes, the timing is just a *bit* screwy, it&#39;s that pause you have to work<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
And of course all of this is assuming 1. it doesn&#39;t break charm early  2.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t resist charm, but those are to be expected.<br/>
<br/>
Bien<br/>
p.s.  BTW, has anyone ever heard a wierd *boiiiiing* sound when lizzies are<br/>
casting?  It usually happens when I charm them, and they try to damage cast<br/>
on me, but I&#39;m protected, but not always<br/>
<br/>
p.p.s  When charming, you might want to think about charming the casters. 1.<br/>
They do some mighty damage   2.  They seem to run out of mana during a long<br/>
fight :)     Unfortunately, if they start a heal before you charm them, they<br/>
still heal the mob :(<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve recently aquired the much coveted (by me at least) charm song. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; done some limited experimenting, mostly on very light greens so that I can<br/>
&gt; get the hang of it, however I&#39;m finding the timing of this song to be<br/>
&gt; something I just can&#39;t grasp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Generally I select a target, Charm, swtich targets and attack, Selo&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; Hymn,<br/>
&gt; they back to charm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, I seem to charm too early every single time, the mob breaks<br/>
&gt; charm and I get beat on for a full cycle while I try to get charm going<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if any of the more experienced bards on the list could<br/>
&gt; offer<br/>
&gt; any tips on timing this so that I can start singing charm as the mob is<br/>
&gt; about to break out, rather than waiting until I get pounded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I realize that I&#39;ll need to put in a lot of practice and that it will be<br/>
&gt; hard to break the ingrained habit of making sure all my songs overlap.<br/>
&gt; Just<br/>
&gt; figured I&#39;d appeal to the list before spending 3 hours in teh newbie area<br/>
&gt; perfecting my timing.<br/>
