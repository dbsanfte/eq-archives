<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He gets killed for reasons unknown to me but<br/>
&gt;probably affiliated with another quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Unfortunately that&#39;s not the case at all.  He&#39;s a fairly easy kill,<br/>
respawns very quickly, worth a decent amount of xp, and he&#39;s relatively easy<br/>
to get stuck in his little pool & then effectively safezone kill him.  He&#39;s<br/>
camped & killed by people in the 30&#39;s range over & over & over again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The other night I saw two 20+ PC&#39;s attack and kill Ulnus MacManus at the<br/>
&gt;barbarian fishing village in West Karanas.  I asked they why they killed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>him<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and they said that he is an oaf and they hate him for keeping the wolf<br/>
&gt;penned up (druid quest or what?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Roughly the same thing as above, though I don&#39;t think you can safezone<br/>
him.  For a while he&#39;d drop a steel halberd worth ALOT of plat everytime.<br/>
Supposedly that&#39;s been changed now.<br/>
