game unless there&#39;s a horrendous balance problem (e.g. cleric<br/>
mask that let them cast call of bones, allowing them to lose<br/>
hp for accelerated mana regen, then use that mana to heal<br/>
themselves).<br/>

Course they also have a necro resurrection spell lined up for<br/>
the expansion so who knows...<br/>
