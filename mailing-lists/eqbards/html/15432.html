<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471949853">Another spot that I found decent is at the live zone in Upper Guk. There<br/>
are 2 spawns just around the corner, 3 on the next island (although 1 is<br/>
always green) and 3 more in the Nokta room to the left of the island coming<br/>
from the zone line. (There are 3-4 more down the right hand tunnel but a<br/>
broken LoS causes problems with breaking the spawn.) I got through 35, 36,<br/>
and 37 solo here Lamenting them and pulling to the zone line. At 37 I could<br/>
rotate through all 8 for about half a bubble of experience I think. Spawn<br/>
time on each of em is about 16-17 minits.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

You could try Lower Guk, live side, near the zone.  There are<br/>
a few shin-level frogs that spawn near there, and make good<br/>
charming targets (well, as good as live frogs get - they tend<br/>
to want to attack you all the time).  The dead side will work<br/>
too (undead are content to attack each other), but tends to be<br/>
more train-prone.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; giants against one another.  Anyone got a better suggestion.  Would it<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; be better to join a group in one of the dungeons or kill ogre bouncers?<br/>
<br/>
Grouping is best.  Best exp 35-40 is Mistmoore.  You can get<br/>
about a bubble every hour or two there with a competent group<br/>
that knows how to work around the bugs in the zone.<br/>
