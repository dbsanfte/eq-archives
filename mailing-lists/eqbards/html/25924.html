<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285412533">RE Twisting 5 songs:<br/>
<br/>
Songs take 3 seconds to cast.<br/>
Songs last until the third pulse after they are cast.<br/>
A pulse occurs once every 6 seconds.<br/>
There is overhead between songs (songs have to ungray, you have to start the next song, it takes some<br/>
time).<br/>
<br/>
Assume 1 second between songs:<br/>
<br/>
T-2  Song 1 starts<br/>
T0 Pulse 0<br/>
T1 Song 1 hits (1 up)<br/>
T2 Song 2 starts<br/>
T5 Song 2 hits (2 up)<br/>
T6 Pulse 1, Song 3 starts<br/>
T9 Song 3 hits (3 up)<br/>
T10 Song 4 starts<br/>
T12 Pulse 2<br/>
T13 Song 4 hits (4 up)<br/>
T14 Song 5 starts<br/>
T17 Song 5 hits (5 up)<br/>
T18 Pulse 3, Song 1 and 2 drop, Song 6 starts (3 up)<br/>
T21 Song 6 hits (4 up)<br/>
T22 Song 7 starts<br/>
T25 Song 7 hits (5 up)<br/>
T26 Pulse 4, Songs 3 and 4 drop (3 up)<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s possible to have 5 up at once for awhile.  But it&#39;s NOT possible to have 5 up at once all the<br/>
time.  Do the same thing with 0 time between songs, you&#39;ll go from 4 to 6, but you&#39;ll always drop back to<br/>
4.  And 0 time between songs is impossible.  At some point between 0 and 1 second overhead time, it<br/>
becomes impossible to maintain 4.  That assumes no missed notes.  And clearly, that fractional difference<br/>
of less than a second may well be due to connection and computer power, and have nothing to do with the<br/>
competence of the player.<br/>
<br/>
The way to APPEAR to get 5 up all at once is to twist in the BoH.  I don&#39;t know for sure, but I suspect<br/>
the Epic and the Siren&#39;s Song also blink when they proc, so they may make it SEEM as if the Bard is<br/>
singing 5.  Charm and Mez last 4 pulses, Anglitsch&#39;s Assonance lasts 10, so they can be used to bump<br/>
things up.  You can with proper ordering and timing of songs, and the right weapons, have 8 effects up at<br/>
once for about 1 second, then it comes tumbling down like a house of cards.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest that the only way another player would KNOW that a Bard was twisting 5 was if the<br/>
Bard was singing 5 buff songs, and I challenge you to come up with 5 useful non-conflicting buff songs<br/>
that are worth the work.<br/>

PS, I went to the BotB and I had trouble keeping 3 up.  We beat a pretty good team in the first round,<br/>
too.  Twisting 4-5 was only possible for me when I was sitting in one place.<br/>
<br/>
PPS, I&#39;ve been able to consistently maintain 3 songs (I know from checking logs) even in conditions (such<br/>
as NToV) where I was receiving text messages 15-30 seconds behind the event they were referring too.  This<br/>
is possible because the outgoing information in EQ is about 1/10th the size of the incoming, and the<br/>
outgoing info is pretty much a steady stream, as opposed to the huge bursts you get on incoming.  So I<br/>
would never rely on the screen timer.  Nice and rhythmic, just like a percussionist, is the way to do it.<br/>
