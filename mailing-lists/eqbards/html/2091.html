<br/>
In the district of E&#39;ci, I&#39;ve made several trips through the smelly swamps of<br/>
Innoluthe and to Cazic-Thule. Allow me to give a few words of advice:<br/>
<br/>
On your way, stick to the right wall in Innoluthe. It&#39;s easy to miss the zone to<br/>
the Ferrott, as I&#39;ve passed it up several times!<br/>
<br/>
Once entering the Ferrott, have your trusty drum equipped, you&#39;ll need to sing<br/>
the Accelerando upon entering. Bouncers Hurd and Flerb like to frequent the<br/>
area, so if they see you, run back to the zone with all haste!  Following the<br/>
left mountain, until you reach shore, diving in, and swimming along the base of<br/>
the temple to the left. As you surface, follow the temple wall, and you&#39;ll see<br/>
the large ramp. Up at the top are a few lizard men, but nothing to big.<br/>
<br/>
Inside, I recommend playing it safe. If your group is in the low 20s and full,<br/>
I&#39;d sing and play the lute, usually alternating between the Hymn and the<br/>
Lullaby, or twisting the Lullaby, Anthem, and the Hymn.  If it&#39;s not a full<br/>
group, I&#39;d be pulling to through the doors, as many many trains come through<br/>
there, rather easily!<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, unless you have faction with the Ogres or Troll, the nearest place to be<br/>
bound is Freeport.  I died once in a few hours of playing, but did rather well<br/>
after that (I stayed by the zone). If you want a security blanket, find yourself<br/>
a benevolent cleric who will resurrect you!<br/>
<br/>
Watch out for those Sentinels, they rarely come lured alone!<br/>
