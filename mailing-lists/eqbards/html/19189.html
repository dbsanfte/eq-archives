&gt; Rokenn<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello all, I&#39;ve lurked here long enough, time to finally post.  I&#39;ll <br/>
go Rokenn even one better.  I created a bard using conventional<br/>
wisdom <br/>
amd leveled him up to 15.  At that point I switched servers.  When I <br/>
created my new bard I remembered a whole lot of hassle with weight<br/>
and <br/>
not a ton of benefit out of that little extra CHA and stole some <br/>
points from their to put in to STR.<br/>
<br/>
As for Gordon, he&#39;s a PR hack, not a customer service type.  Sounds<br/>
to <br/>
me like GZ sent him out with a &#39;what if&#39; and he tacked weaving invis <br/>
on the end on his own.  Heck if they knew all the answers why bother <br/>
to ask us in the first place?  <br/>
<br/>
I think someone mentioned the other day that an enchanter may have <br/>
well over 150 spells in their book when they hit 50 and that&#39;s just <br/>
one class.  Brad mentioned in an interview the other day that there <br/>
are over 1400 quests in the game now.  Anyone want to take a pop at <br/>
how many different 1HS weapons are out there?  Armor? How about we <br/>
talk trade skill recipes?<br/>
<br/>
Listen up, this is an incredibly complicated game with literally tens <br/>
of thousands of issues to deal with.  Flaming a guy because he did<br/>
not <br/>
know one aspect of one song is ridiculous.  I expect more from a<br/>
group <br/>
of bards.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rant =)<br/>
