<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-627139894">Isn&#39;t the effect of the Lament only temporary?  For example, lets say there<br/>
are four orcs standing together.  As a 10th level bard, I know I can&#39;t<br/>
handle them all at once.  I target the first three in order and sing the<br/>
Lament.  In my experience so far, by the time I finish singing the Lament on<br/>
the 3d orc, its effects have already worn off on the first one I targeted.<br/>
If I move in at that point, two will attack me (#1 and #4).  Isn&#39;t this<br/>
tactic really only useful with the Bellow (which I don&#39;t have yet)?   <br/>

&gt;      1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area <br/>
&gt;      effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a<br/>
&gt; step <br/>
&gt;      by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group <br/>
&gt;      of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; *************************<br/>
&gt; The way the lull spell works is that it is not an Area effect.  It is a<br/>
&gt; single target spell.  What you do is you select one of the Mob in turn and<br/>
&gt; play the song.  You will see a text saying that they are sad.  Do this to<br/>
&gt; all of the MOB except for the one you want to fight.  This spell will only<br/>
&gt; effect up to 4 MOB.  What I do when I hunt orc&#39;s camp is that I would lull<br/>
&gt; the other 3 then I would play my bellow song on the one I did not lull and<br/>
&gt; back off out of range of the rest of the MOB and attack that one.  Then<br/>
&gt; repeat the step for the other 3.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hoped this help.<br/>
