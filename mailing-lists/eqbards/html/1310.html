&gt; &gt; The shady swashbuckler is still giving me better prices as I<br/>
&gt; &gt; increase my charisma though.  223pp at 110, 220pp at 115.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just got back to Freeport last night and need to test it at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 120.  So there&#39;s definitely some faction/race/diety component<br/>
&gt; &gt; to all this.  The charisma song may be worthwhile in this<br/>
&gt; &gt; regard (especially since half those damn stuck-up Erudite<br/>
&gt; &gt; merchants won&#39;t sell to me).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing to note... the swashbuckler is very inconsistent in his prices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was in the market for a top of the line weapon, so I was considering<br/>
&gt; buying a well-balanced longsword.  I went to the Swashbuckler, and he quoted<br/>
&gt; me 250 plat and change.  I decided to think it over.  A couple of days<br/>
&gt; later, I decided I&#39;d go for it, since nobody was selling barbed whips<br/>
&gt; anymore.  When I showed up at the swashbuckler though, he was asking 280<br/>
&gt; plat for the same sword!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At first, I thought I was just remembering the price of the sword<br/>
&gt; incorrectly, but 280 was more than I wanted to pay, so I decided to forget<br/>
&gt; about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Two days after THAT I found someone who was willing to sell me two barbed<br/>
&gt; whips (finally).  I decided that the best place to meet was at the shady<br/>
&gt; swashbuckler, as it was halfway between us.  While waiting for her, I took<br/>
&gt; at look at his prices, and low and behold... the same longsword was now 230!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have no idea what drives the prices on this guy.  My charisma was the same<br/>
&gt; in all three cases, and my faction stayed relatively consistent throughout.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>
