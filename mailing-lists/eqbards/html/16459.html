<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting that you phrase it that way.  You&#39;re only<br/>
considering the case where a DoT doesn&#39;t last its full<br/>
duration.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The reason melee types suffer from the change from fast to steady when it<br/>
&gt; seems counterintuitive is deceptive.  Although the melee class has more<br/>
&gt; &#39;time&#39; it seems to do damage and is thus more effective, in reality this<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t so.  Unlike the DoT which is fire and forget, the melee class is on a<br/>
&gt; different clock.  The DoT is on &#39;real time&#39;.  If a fight lasts longer it<br/>
&gt; does more damage.  The melee person is on &#39;hp time&#39;.  No matter how long a<br/>
&gt; fight lasts, the melee person&#39;s clock is limited to his/her own hp&#39;s.  When<br/>
&gt; they run out, the person is done fighting whether the fight is over or not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree with this.  A melee person&#39;s ability to damage a<br/>
mob is (survival_time * damage_rate).  Whether you increase a<br/>
mob&#39;s hp by 40% or increase the damage it does by 40%, the %<br/>
of red a melee person can take off a mob&#39;s hp bar is (roughly)<br/>
the same (one is the inverse of the other, but as long as the <br/>
percentages don&#39;t get too high, they&#39;re comparable).<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, a DoT has a survival_time, but it&#39;s a fixed amount<br/>
(duration of the DoT).  Hence increasing mob damage has no<br/>
effect on DoT effectiveness.  OTOH, increasing mob hp will<br/>
increase DoT effectiveness if the DoT isn&#39;t allowed to last<br/>
its full duration, while it will decrease DoT effectiveness<br/>
(relatively speaking) if the DoT lasts its full duration.  <br/>
Depending on where a DoT falls in this duration game, melee<br/>
can be helped or hurt (relative to DoTs) by giving mobs more<br/>
hp.<br/>
<br/>
The simplest way to balance casters with melee IMHO would be<br/>
to give mobs so many hp that killing a white/yellow mob<br/>
required casters to expend all their mana via their most<br/>
efficient damage spells spells and a couple root/snares with<br/>
zero resists.  To prevent it from upsetting melee, you&#39;d just<br/>
have to decrease the damage the mob did proportionately.  <br/>
This would make it so melee people could barely kill an even<br/>
con, and casters could barely kill an even con.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This explains many of Verant&#39;s misconceptions.  If hp&#39;s of mobs were less,<br/>
&gt; as in Beta, then Wizards would be very balanced.  Melee types would die less<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do agree with your assessment that this is why wizards are<br/>
screwed, though not for the exact same reason.  DoTs are just<br/>
much more efficient than DD.<br/>
