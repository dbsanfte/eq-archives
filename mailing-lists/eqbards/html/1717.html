<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857752723">Kit say back, enjoying another bottle of fine elven wine.  If only he could<br/>
get that pretty red-haired serving girl to join him things would be even<br/>
better.  He flashed her a smile as she passed, just to let her know he was<br/>
ready for another drink.<br/>
<br/>
As he waited for her to return he turned his gaze to the pair of adventurers<br/>
playing King&#39;s court over by the wall.  A tall burly type all decked out in<br/>
plate and his stylish friend with a drum by his chair.  A fellow bard he<br/>
wondered to himself?  He noticed that the warrior type was drinking rather<br/>
heavily, and sweating nearly as much.  <br/>
<br/>
Kit watched amusedly as the burly one removed his armor piece by piece.  If<br/>
I made a lass wait that long in the evenings, her ardor would surely cool.<br/>
Still, perhaps it might have its uses, twas surely flashy enough.  Then to<br/>
his amazement, while the warrior answered the call of Tunare, the other bard<br/>
decided to try on the plate for himself!<br/>
<br/>
As Kit watched the other bard put on the Great steel helmet, hmmm that would<br/>
make it difficult to see my rakish good looks, not to mention ruining those<br/>
windswept locks.  Still it would deflect a gnoll&#39;s mace well...  The<br/>
breastplate, keep one from getting poked by a spear perhaps, but what&#39;s the<br/>
point of having a flawless chest and tight abs if the ladies can&#39;t see<br/>
them...  The guantlets???  Right out he thought to himself, playing a<br/>
mandolin is tricky enough in snakeskin, the cost in strings alone would make<br/>
those gauntlets seem cheap by comparison.  Boots???  Well I suppose it would<br/>
make you less likely to be trod upon by clumsy barbarians coming off the<br/>
ship, but how would he sneak deep into the lair of the Splitpaw clanhold<br/>
with those things on, for that matter with any of it on.  <br/>
<br/>
Kit sighed as the other bard seemed enamored with the feel and weight of the<br/>
newfound protection.  Yes he thought, it would well keep you from sword and<br/>
claw, but so would guile and magery.  Perhaps that might suit him thought<br/>
Kit as he led the pretty redhaired lass upstairs, twirling a key around his<br/>
finger; but give me the freedom to move and I&#39;ll be happy to let the brutes<br/>
keep their plate.  I have better armor he laughed, my rapier wit, keen<br/>
intellect, and rakish good looks.  True the Splitpaw don&#39;t appreciate them,<br/>
but then again only Ren Rexx ever saw them, and he only briefly...<br/>

                  Kitasi<br/>
     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>
      &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>
       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>
     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>
        and each to his seperate star...&quot;</div>
