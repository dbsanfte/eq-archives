<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780863536">heh almost out of the hole, SS BP and SS Legs hurt the points badly.  a<br/>
singing short sword will put me way back in the hole, but i&#39;m not that close<br/>
yet.  there was a guild on MM that left to Drinal that basically copied our<br/>
point system verbatim, with some minor tweaks.  i&#39;m not sure if any guilds<br/>
on other servers have quite as structured a point system.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I had a look at your guild&#39;s site and read up on your loot <br/>
&gt; systems (you were<br/>
&gt; in the negative loot points, iirc ;)  That sounds like a very <br/>
&gt; good system,<br/>
&gt; and I was wondering if other guilds on other servers did similarly. </span></blockquote></div>
