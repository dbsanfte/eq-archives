<br/>
I think the best place to gain experience at your level would be East<br/>
Karana.  The loot is extremely bad, but the xp is really goood for<br/>
soloing.  However to hunt here you must be willing to kite the blues in<br/>
this area.  Just kite the creatures around for a bit and then fight them<br/>
at the briodge to North Karana.  If anything goes wrong you can zone quite<br/>
easily.<br/>

&gt; Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a lvl 17 bard trying to find a good place to hunt.  I am mostly around<br/>
&gt; Oasis but willing to travel for exp and loot.  I need a good place with<br/>
&gt; decent amount of plp to group with.  I tried Unrest, and Highpass.  It seems<br/>
&gt; that no one wants a bard because we attract too much attentions.  Please<br/>
&gt; give suggestions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thnx,<br/>
