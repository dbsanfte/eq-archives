<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-536834843">In the Qeynos Bards guild there is a Quest to get Lute Strings for Fabian.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Spoiler: <br/>
First you need the Bag of Troll Guts.  This is found off of Zahal the Vile <br/>
in North Karanas.   <br/>
Next you Give the Bag of Troll Guts and 50 gold pieces to Saska? in the <br/>
Qeynos Bards Guild.  She shall give you &quot;Lute Strings&quot; back and tell you to <br/>
take them to Fabian.  It is important to give the 50 gold to her as well. <br/>
If you only give her the Bag of Troll guts she shall ask for the other items<br/>
<br/>
and keep your bag.   <br/>
<br/>
But here I am stuck.  I cannot Find Fabian.  I ask the List for assistance. <br/>
I searched nearly every building in Qeynos with Tracking on but could not <br/>
find him.  Does anyone know where he might be?   <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone Completed this quest?  What is the result?   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
