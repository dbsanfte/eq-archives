<b>Subject:</b> Grouping with enchanters (was Re: Chain and Binding) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-777912582">If you&#39;re grouped with a ranger/druid and enchanter, I&#39;m<br/>
finding Binding to be more useful than Chain (in areas where<br/>
AE songs are safe).  Chain interferes with snare so you lose<br/>
its attack speed slowdown if you let the druid/ranger snare<br/>
early in a fight.  Binding does not interfere with snare, so<br/>
you can Bind away to your heart&#39;s content.  The AE also means<br/>
if you get a big pull, you&#39;ll be slowing down all their<br/>
attacks, which gives the enchanter more time and a better<br/>
chance to mesmerize the extras (neither Chain nor Binding<br/>
break mesmerize), since most enchanters are afraid to use area<br/>
effect mesmerize in cramped dungeons for fear of mesmerizing<br/>
themselves.  Thanks Sylly for getting me to try this song<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
The enchanter also has better attack speed debuffs, but the<br/>
one I group with uses it only if we&#39;re in a close fight<br/>
because of the mana cost (mana better spent mesmerizing so the<br/>
attack speed of the extras is zero).  Binding on the other<br/>
hand is free, so I can use it all the time (well, watch out<br/>
for other people pulling through the area you&#39;re fighting).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been using Chant of Battle instead of Anthem since I<br/>
haven&#39;t found the enchanter and Anthem speedups to stack.  <br/>
Our enchanter usually keeps augmentation on everyone (+15%,<br/>
better than Anthem&#39;s +10%), subverting it with alacrity or<br/>
celerity if things get hairy.  So Anthem then becomes merely a<br/>
str buff, and Chant of Battle without a drum ends up being<br/>
marginally better since it raises stats by the same amount and<br/>
also raises AC.  I&#39;ll have to reassess this when I get<br/>
Celerity at L36 of course.<br/>
<br/>
I still keep Pixie Strike memorized, for dealing with casting<br/>
mobs - I&#39;m still not sure which is better: raising everyone&#39;s<br/>
resists or Striking continuously to interrupt casters.  The<br/>
only disadvatage to Striking I&#39;ve found is that it tends to<br/>
push the mob quite a ways in one direction in a long fight.<br/>
Raising resists seems to be effective, but there&#39;s something<br/>
immensely satisfying about seeing &quot;A Solusek mage00&#39;s casting<br/>
is interrupted&quot; twenty times in a fight.  :-)  Striking will<br/>
also stop priests and shamen from healing themselves,<br/>
something raising resists will not do.<br/>
<br/>
Strike is also handy for those rare occasions when the<br/>
enchanter goes OOM and we still have a couple mobs left to<br/>
deal with.  This fits in well with the bard&#39;s ability to take<br/>
over just about any job as needed (tank, heal, buff, crowd<br/>
control).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taken to dropping charm though since the enchanter can<br/>
usually mesmerize anything on the healers faster than I could<br/>
charm them to pull them off.  (I think I need to have a<br/>
word or two with our clerics about timing their initial heals<br/>
until after the enchanter has mesmerized at least one mob -<br/>
makes no difference in terms of time to mesmerize, but the<br/>
tanks tend to break off to defend the cleric which winds up<br/>
breaking mesmerize if the enchanter succeeds.)<br/>
