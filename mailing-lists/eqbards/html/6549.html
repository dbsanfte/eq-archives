<div id="ygrps-yiv-152906192"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The only caveat is that your group *must* attack only one<br/>
&gt;target at a time, and a healer is *highly* desirable because<br/>
&gt;all the monsters will really hate you for putting them to<br/>
&gt;sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The other (albeit related) Caveat is that if you are grouped with folks who<br/>
have AEs as thier big damage spells, or more than one druid who wants to<br/>
cast swarm, or you plan to use DDD/CoD there is no point in Lulling them.<br/>
Mostly these days I just slow em down and takes my beatings...<br/>
