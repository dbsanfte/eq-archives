<div id="ygrps-yiv-292661763">The assumption that you are your equipment is, imho, a<br/>
false one.  I could care less whether another player<br/>
has better equipment than I do (I&#39;m gonna try to get<br/>
the best I can myself).  You are what you do.  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen lvl 7 dwarves in full bronze with an<br/>
executioner&#39;s axe running around orc hill kill<br/>
stealing.  No one except another KewLDooD will respect<br/>
that player and when he gets to the level that he must<br/>
group to succeed, he&#39;s toast.  He won&#39;t have learned<br/>
the lessons he needs to to compete.<br/>
<br/>
If you (figuratively) expect me to respect you because<br/>
of your equipment, forget about it.  If you expect me<br/>
to respect you because you are good in a fight,<br/>
because you are helpful to players at a lower level<br/>
than you, or because you RP a bard well, rest assured<br/>
I will.<br/>

&gt; days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>
&gt; and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not*<br/>
&gt; fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk<br/>
&gt; up to 23rd and an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing<br/>
&gt; that the best class in<br/>
&gt; the game was bard..  but I digress.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent,<br/>
&gt; dual Ykeshas, Flowing Black<br/>
&gt; Silk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked<br/>
&gt; out like a level 50<br/>
&gt; that hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago<br/>
&gt; I saw a level 15 in<br/>
&gt; full Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other<br/>
&gt; goodies as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly*<br/>
&gt; discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor<br/>
&gt; that I have and I *still*<br/>
&gt; lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on<br/>
&gt; the sands of Oasis,<br/>
&gt; being *less* complete than a guy that started his<br/>
&gt; bard last weekend.  Not<br/>
&gt; only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having<br/>
&gt; 38 &#39;played&#39; days and not<br/>
&gt; being level 50.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When there ceases to be any way for players&#39;<br/>
&gt; characters to differentiate<br/>
&gt; themselves from one another other based upon level<br/>
&gt; (i.e. time and effort<br/>
&gt; expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want,<br/>
&gt; when people look at me,<br/>
&gt; for them to know that I braved death and died many<br/>
&gt; times to achieve the<br/>
&gt; armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to<br/>
&gt; assume that I bought it from<br/>
&gt; a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked<br/>
&gt; myself with it.  I am now<br/>
&gt; &quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO<br/>
&gt; DROP it would be a<br/>
&gt; different story.  The bard that I saw in Oasis would<br/>
&gt; have been in steel<br/>
&gt; probably and I would have something tangible and<br/>
&gt; visual over him based upon<br/>
&gt; my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know*<br/>
&gt; that I had earned the<br/>
&gt; pieces for myself.  They would know that I had<br/>
&gt; pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled<br/>
&gt; Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>
&gt; for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; being NO DROP has reduced my<br/>
&gt; efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing<br/>
&gt; playing a game that makes me<br/>
&gt; feel this way.<br/>
