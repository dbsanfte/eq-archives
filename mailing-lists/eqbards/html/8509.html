<div id="ygrps-yiv-230567004"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m level 28, and I have 1000 pp in the bank, just waiting <br/>
&gt;to buy a drum.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Money... yuck.  Money is so worthless these days.  If I was a<br/>
non-bard class with a mistmoore battle drum I would want some<br/>
item in trade for it.  (i consider the drums ~500pp)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Of course now, that 1000pp will probably start going toward <br/>
&gt;lambent armor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You gonna buy your armor from people?  Ugh.  I can feel the <br/>
value of that armor rising already.  This is just my opinion,<br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t dish out a lot of plat for these things, else<br/>
you drive the price up on the armor.  Let&#39;s face it, less than<br/>
10% of any server population is class: Bard.  It&#39;s not like<br/>
Mr. Wizard Killstealer is gonna farm up the items for the quest<br/>
and start selling off to bards for outrageous prices.  This is<br/>
one case where you can tell someone to go &#39;stuff themselves.&#39;<br/>
For crafted armor, there&#39;s always another warrior around who<br/>
needs it and will pay big money for it.  Bards are not a dime<br/>
a dozen, so sales outlets tend to be rather small.  Mr. Wizard<br/>
wont tell you, &#39;Fine I&#39;ll sell to some other bard&#39; -- cause he<br/>
ain&#39;t gonna find many others. hehe.  At level 39, I think I am<br/>
in the top 20 list now of activate bards on my server.  All the<br/>
other bards either are too low to complete the quest themselves<br/>
or too poor to foot the bill for this armor.<br/>
<br/>
 side note:  I think I&#39;m in the top 5 for tactics/knowledge<br/>
 of my bard.  I&#39;ve seen L45-50 bards not know the first thing<br/>
 on how to play one.  But they have mostly Mithril, FBSS, and<br/>
 two ykeshas, so that must make them badass (read: twinked).<br/>
 <br/>
 I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;d rather have some nice magical instruments<br/>
 than try to pretend to be a warrior mini-me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe I&#39;ll just have to pry the drum out of the cold dead <br/>
&gt;hands of the princess myself one of these days.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Castle Mistmoore can flush a full 40+ group very quickly.<br/>
Chances that you&#39;ll loot the item are extremely slim below<br/>
level 40 &lt;g&gt;   Being level 50 there is meaningless, too --<br/>
either way no matter what your level, things get ugly fast.<br/>
