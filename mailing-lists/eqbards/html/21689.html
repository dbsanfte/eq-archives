<div id="ygrps-yiv-622306104">One side note on this issue however.  If the individual in question did<br/>
things such as are mentioned in these stories (which really are quite<br/>
horrible) online, and someone heard them and complained, then they could be<br/>
banned.  Verant does have the right to control what happens in their<br/>
property, virtual though it may be.  What they do not legally have the right<br/>
to do is to extend that right to events which occur outside of their<br/>
property.  They probably do have the power to do it, but not the legal<br/>
basis.  If they did it to the wrong person they likely would get sued.  Some<br/>
people do have more indignance and money than sense; Larry Flynt comes to<br/>
mind.</div>
