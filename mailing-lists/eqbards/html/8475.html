<div id="ygrps-yiv-780565899">After using this song extensively for crowd control against<br/>
high blue mobs (Sol B, Lower Guk), I&#39;m now convinced that this<br/>
song is broken against monsters too.<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought that mobs were just breaking out of the<br/>
song effect immediately after their &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; all the<br/>
time.  But the pattern I&#39;m seeing over and over is that mobs<br/>
that take 5-10 Pixie Strikes to successfully mes (&quot;eyes glaze<br/>
over&quot; and it doesn&#39;t immediately wake up) are actually trivial<br/>
to keep mesmerized, even while weaving one or two extra songs.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I&#39;m getting about a 10%-20% success rate at<br/>
successfully mesmerizing them initially (resists maybe 10%-30%<br/>
of the time); but once Strike sticks once, subsequent Strikes<br/>
stick maybe 70%-90% of the time (i.e. whenever it isn&#39;t<br/>
resisted).  Recognize these percentages?  They&#39;re the same<br/>
estimate I gave for when Strike wasn&#39;t resisted but had no<br/>
effect against myself and other players.<br/>
<br/>
Is seems that this bug doesn&#39;t happen when you Strike a target<br/>
that&#39;s already mesmerized, which is why it&#39;s so easy to keep<br/>
them mes&#39;ed when you finally do get a Strike to stick.<br/>
<br/>
I urge everyone with this song to test it on themselves to see<br/>
the &quot;not resisted, icon is up, but no effect&quot; bug, and /bug to<br/>
have it fixed.  This is a serious impairment to our ability to<br/>
do crowd control.  Given our lack of defensive melee skills,<br/>
I&#39;m sometimes even finding it more effective not to do any<br/>
crowd control and just let the extra mob(s) beat on a real<br/>
tank.<br/>
