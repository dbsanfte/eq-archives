<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbard] A Bard&#39;s usefulness after lvl 12 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842024761">Has the lullaby song been fixed or improved?  When I first bought it a<br/>
level 15, I was unable to lull even a widow hatchling.  To me that is kind<br/>
of useless.  Perhaps I have improved.  As for finding better friends, I<br/>
have tried but it is hard at the moment.  I am in an inbetween situation.<br/>
All of my friends are either in teh 12-14 range or in the 18 and above<br/>
range.  It usually makes it hard for me adventure forth.  I am just hoping<br/>
that this lack of people wishing to party witha bard does not get any<br/>
worse.  I am more of a social player if I get in a good group, but those<br/>
are so hard to find nowadays.  Either you bump into power gamers who steal<br/>
kills and train you to death, or you find those newbies who constantly ask<br/>
you to help them find your corpse ).  As a level 16 bard, what is the best<br/>
place for exp?  I usually solo at this point and would like to find a<br/>
place that gives really good exp and decent loot.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW Did people actually right in a character description in their<br/>
character screen?  I have and nobody looks at it.  They just query my<br/>
armor and then run away.  It frustrates me so because I have been trying<br/>
to roleplay my characters background.  Perhaps it is a time to compose a<br/>
tune to sing everytime I have time to myself, emoting doesn&#39;t even seem to<br/>
give a hint to anyone at all.<br/>
