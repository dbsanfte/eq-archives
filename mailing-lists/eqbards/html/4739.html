<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982596002">I don&#39;t care how its accomplished, but I _really_ need this class<br/>
de-twitched if I want to play my Bard(s) for more than 1 hour at a time.<br/>
If I&#39;m trying after work ... I may as well just bag it.  I really love this<br/>
class, but its not long before my Bard ends up one of my lower level<br/>
characters.  <br/>
<br/>
Sighs ... this seems to be the only &quot;twitch&quot; class in the game, and yes.<br/>
I&#39;ve played all but SK.  <br/>
<br/>
Old fingers, old eyes ... job that needs them both in working order.<br/>
