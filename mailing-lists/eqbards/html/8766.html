&gt;what I need.  Do you think that Gardern would still cough <br/>
&gt;up lambent sapphires if Genni wasn&#39;t around?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  Some idiot last night attacked Genni and trained<br/>
the entire Temple to the zone.  Oddly enough Gardern stayed<br/>
behind (out of his agro range, or player died)  Then Genni <br/>
was no where to be found, tracking or not.  I still got the<br/>
lambent sapphire to work, without her visually in the zone.<br/>
