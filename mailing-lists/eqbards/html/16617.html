<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956177644">The Hermit is 20th, not 24th.  He sometimes spawns at 21st, but not often.<br/>
On Fennin Ro he spawns every three minutes, and it&#39;s been the same since I<br/>
moved to Druzzil Ro.  I&#39;ve been camping him recently too with my 22nd<br/>
Enchanter.  Three minutes is really nice because you have to hustle to med<br/>
and heal up in time for the next one if you want to catch him without his<br/>
damage shield.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s very good experience if you can catch him uncamped and the loot is<br/>
pretty good.  However since Paw was tweaked to higher level there are some<br/>
higher level gnolls that come through every once and a while.  Hunting the<br/>
Hermit isn&#39;t as safe as it used to be, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>

&gt; Having just done it I am ready for this question!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Hermit, South Karana:<br/>
&gt; He is around level 24, sometimes he is easy sometimes pretty tough. (8<br/>
&gt; minute spawn). because of his damage shield he is the perfect spawn to<br/>
&gt; practice all instrument attack on.  Pull him with Dennons<br/>
&gt; Dischord, fight at<br/>
&gt; his front door NOT by the chimney (reason in a sec). If you can pull him<br/>
&gt; before he casts his damage shield you can punch him as well, else just use<br/>
&gt; instruments. Often he pulls ahead at first but all but once I<br/>
&gt; caught up and<br/>
&gt; took him. My combo was DDD,CoD,Largos Binding, Heal. </span></blockquote></div>
