&gt; &gt;  NPCs do _not_ _not_ _not_ have unlimited mana.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  They have a whole s-load of it, and it regens very very fast<br/>
&gt; &gt;  when they are not in combat.  But once you see a mob spend alot<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately in terms of even cons it effectively is unlimited.  Even green<br/>
&gt; no xp bandit wizard casters will kill a single PC many levels after he stops<br/>
&gt; getting xp for them.  If the song cut their mana by 10% per pulse it might<br/>
&gt; matter, but otherwise its pretty much a waste.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I pointed that out in the Ask the Archmage thread.  I<br/>
said the song seems to be tuned for PvP instead of PvM, and<br/>
asked if it could be retuned to be effective in PvM as well.  <br/>
Unfortunately, comparing what I read in the original thread<br/>
and seeing GZ&#39;s replies, it appears he ignored every question<br/>
that could be construed to imply that something wasn&#39;t working<br/>
right.<br/>
