<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126493266">I think there&#39;s a lot of reason to be dissatisfied with Verant in<br/>
Customer-Service type issue.  I agree with the general thread of Kit&#39;s<br/>
arguments that Verant presents an arrogant attitude towards their customer<br/>
base and, for the most part, the suggestions that players make regarding the<br/>
game in general.<br/>
<br/>
A good friend of mine, a former member of my guild, has many close friends<br/>
who are executives of various Computer Game companies (so he is in position<br/>
to compare). He went to E3 and talked to Brad, Gordon, and Jeff Butler.<br/>
They really came off as described above.  At one point - one of them made a<br/>
statement that my friend saw as a blatant lie regarding 51+ spell drops (and<br/>
subsequently was contradicted - one could argue it was an honest mistake as<br/>
opposed to a lie - but that&#39;s not my point here).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not surprising that given the  success of Everquest - Verant developed<br/>
an arrogant attitude.  By just about any measurement, they have achieved the<br/>
greatest success any Online Game has seen to date.  I can&#39;t blame for that -<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t or  shouldn&#39;t criticize them.<br/>
<br/>
This is my opinion, perhaps rational, perhaps irrational - but as a paying<br/>
customer I have every right to that opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Right now - Verant basically has two competitors; UO which is a several<br/>
years older product and AC.  AC came out about the same time (perhaps a bit<br/>
newer) and is an inferior product to begin with.  But every indication I&#39;ve<br/>
seen shows that they are WAY better than Verant as far as testing and<br/>
support (although I&#39;ll admit - this is based on only a few articles I&#39;ve<br/>
read and beyond a small amount of beta-testing no first-hand experience).<br/>
<br/>
Basically - we have very little baseline to compare how good a job Verant is<br/>
doing.  That doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t entitled to our opinions.  .0001 % - not<br/>
sure I agree with that.  One could assume that board posts are to some<br/>
degree a random sample of the customer base as a whole.  Maybe not complexly<br/>
accurate - but certainly a lot more than .01 basis point.<br/>
<br/>
In the near future - UOL will have their next generation product out.  Other<br/>
competitors will be out in a year or so.  It will be very interesting to<br/>
revisit this issue in 18 months.<br/>
<br/>
I predict that the new offerings will do a better job dealing with<br/>
customers - even if they have EQ2 out - Verant will find out - they&#39;ve done<br/>
a mediocre job at best at dealing with these types of issues and will be<br/>
playing catch-up.<br/>
<br/>
Enough from me on this topic!<br/>
