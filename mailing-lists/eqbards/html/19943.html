<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506756879"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>why is it a big deal that there was no notice?  you didn&#39;t get a<br/>
grieving period?<br/>

Regardless of the purpose of the server, people played their characters<br/>
(some while testing) for many months, developing styles, personalities and<br/>
friends.  I hardly think if you&#39;d been in the same situation you&#39;d be able<br/>
to shrug it of as &quot;just a test character.&quot;</div>
