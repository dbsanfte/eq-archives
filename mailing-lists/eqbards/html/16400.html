We went to PoH Friday night.  Drop rate really bad for us.  No bard stuff.<br/>
Around 5.30 am we dispelled everyone and were in the process of rebuffing in<br/>
some special buff order we use when Uncle Innie broke loose from his &quot;stuck<br/>
in the wall&quot; spot and patrolled his area.  He got very &quot;agro-vated&quot; at us<br/>
and attacked us before we knew what was up.  Soon, we found out what was up<br/>
because we were all thrown &quot;up&quot; into the air.  I landed on a roof top and<br/>
had to track back to my party.  Others were thrown thru the ceiling and<br/>
landed in &quot;the room with no exit.&quot;  Extended CorpseRecovery began.  Several<br/>
theorys were discussed on how we could get the folks out of the room with no<br/>
exit but before we could agree on which to try first, a guide/gm showed up<br/>
and got our folks out.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier last week, I left the very last pick-up group I will ever do.  I<br/>
swear!  There were 3 guildies and 3 outsiders - we were camping the<br/>
StoneSpider room.  One was a druid nobody really knew.  After I camped for<br/>
the night, he left a fight to chase the guano harvester.  He killed it and<br/>
told the group &quot;I am keeping the loot because I solo&#39;d it.&quot;  He was however<br/>
happy enough to be in and win a random on the Brown Chitin Protector that<br/>
dropped off the SS earlier.  Yes they booted him and took his name for their<br/>
&quot;never again&quot; lists.  Just hearing this tale put me over the edge.  Never<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, yes still 48 - grrr.  Too many dragon and plane raids (Crier, I know<br/>
exactly what you mean).  And not enough blue spectres.  I guess those days<br/>
are past.<br/>
