easy to acquire for any party in their low 30s or higher (as<br/>
long as they have a bard or enchanter that knows what they&#39;re<br/>
doing).  My guild is not the camping or powergaming type, but<br/>
we managed to pick up one of these axes for just about<br/>
everyone in a few hours fighting in that area of Permafrost<br/>
for experience.<br/>
<br/>
The spawn in the area is all linked, so it&#39;s very difficult to<br/>
crack (thus the need for a bard or enchanter).  But once you<br/>
break it it&#39;s pretty easy.  Our biggest problem turned out to<br/>
be soloers coming in and trying to steal/beg a turn from an<br/>
area they clearly couldn&#39;t have handled on their own.  We<br/>
invited them to join our group (we had 8 people there in two<br/>
parties), and made sure every one who did join got a special<br/>
item before they left.  But a couple of them refused to join,<br/>
yet hung around calling us names for not giving them a turn.  <br/>
Sometimes I just don&#39;t understand people...<br/>

The axe is a wonderful item for a bard.  6 dam 22 del and only<br/>
2.5 wt.  It solved all my stamina problems - I can now solo<br/>
two and a half blue mobs in succession (with a cleric healing<br/>
me of course) before I start to run low on stamina.  It also<br/>
has the cool medieval axe look, instead of the stone-age axe<br/>
look of the PGT.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where is this weapon found?!?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend in<br/>
&gt; Unrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>
&gt; told they do not exist.  I never see anyone using this weapon, nor do I see<br/>

rare spawn.  Somehow I saw three of them my first week in<br/>
Unrest, and I&#39;ve never seen any since.  It drops the Pugius as<br/>
the common drop, and the Gladius (7/29 short sword) as the<br/>
rare drop.  I know some of the folks on this list know where<br/>
it spawns.  Dunno if they&#39;ll share that info though.  It looks<br/>
like the rock dervishes in Lavastorm, except it&#39;s composed of<br/>
flying blades instead of flying rocks.<br/>
