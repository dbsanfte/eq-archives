&gt; &gt; Why is the bard song too dangerous?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t make the original statement, but I&#39;ll tell you why *I* think it is<br/>
&gt; too dangerous.  The bard song only affects party members within a certain<br/>
&gt; range of the bard.   We&#39;ve all experienced the case where a party member<br/>
&gt; gets out of range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando and then falls behind the party.<br/>
&gt; Imagine the same thing happening 100 feet underwater.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again though, like most of the discussion on my post, this misses what I<br/>
thought was my main point, which is that a bard song wearing off should<br/>
not nullify an already in effect spell. That is what makes the bard<br/>
song especially dangerous. You can&#39;t even use it for yourself when<br/>
grouped or to help one person who the spell effect has worn off from,<br/>
without risking negatively effecting other party members who happen to<br/>
be in range. What makes it doubly dangerous is that the spell icon is<br/>
still in place on their screen, so they may not notice that they&#39;ve lost<br/>
the effect until it&#39;s too late.<br/>
<br/>
Your points however are equally valid. It&#39;s enough problem keeping a<br/>
party together with Selo&#39;s, given that people theoretically run all at<br/>
the same speed in this game, with the huge variation in swimming speed<br/>
depending on skill it wouldnt be much use as the party&#39;s main resource<br/>
for an underwater trip. But the cancellation effect makes it less than<br/>
useful as a back up resource as well.<br/>
