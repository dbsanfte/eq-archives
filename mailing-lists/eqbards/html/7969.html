<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847471080">Haha, please god I hope not. Although that&#39;s what I&#39;d be expecting from Verant<br/>
at this time. Actually, as long as it doesnt involve camping a lvl 2 mob that<br/>
spawns every 18 hours and roams between Qeynos Hills and East Commons with<br/>
innate invisibility I&#39;ll be happy.<br/>

&gt; Hmmm bet I can guess what the new quests are like.  Here&#39;s a sample:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aloro: Hail, Wethyl Stringplucker!<br/>
&gt; Wethyl: Hail, Aloro.  Can you help me?  I have need of some [special picks].<br/>
&gt; Aloro: What special picks?<br/>
&gt; Wethyl: In order to perform my latest composition I need only the finest<br/>
&gt; quality picks.  [Sylia Windlehands] in Kelethin stole my last one.<br/>
&gt; Aloro: &lt;looking nervously around&gt; You mean the bard guildmistress there?<br/>
&gt; The one who trained me in the fundamentals of music?<br/>
&gt; Wethyl:<br/>
&gt; Aloro: What do you want from Sylia Windlehands?<br/>
&gt; Wethyl: Slay her and bring me the pick she carries.  I will make it well<br/>
&gt; worth your time.<br/>
&gt; Aloro: Listen, Wethyl, thanks and all, but 1) Sylia is a friend of mine, and<br/>
&gt; 2) I already have a mandolin.  Push off, you sick monkey!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, ok, I am a trifle cynical, but we&#39;ll see. = P<br/>
