&gt;After we broke the spawn we had the ShadowKnight summon a pet to eat the<br/>
&gt;harm touch, it worked even better :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the way we do it. The pet (unless its a necro pet) eats the harm <br/>
touch.  We were having a warrior eat it if we had no pets. I&#39;ll draft a <br/>
cleric to do it next time, great idea!!<br/>
