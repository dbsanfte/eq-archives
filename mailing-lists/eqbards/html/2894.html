 </span></blockquote>One addendum.  If anyone has cast a beneficial spell on you<br/>
(e.g. clerical healing or buff), they need to zone as well.<br/>
When they do that, they get added to the monster&#39;s hate list<br/>
because they helped someone the monster hates.  You zone and<br/>
you are no longer on the monster&#39;s hate list.  You play a song<br/>
which helps the cleric (basically any party effect song), and<br/>
you are right back on the hate list.  This &quot;aggro pollution&quot;<br/>
can spread like a virus as party members help each other with<br/>
buffs and heals and cures.  So if this has been going on for a<br/>
while, the entire party should zone.<br/>
