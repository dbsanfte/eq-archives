<div id="ygrps-yiv-908506317">Well, I&#39;m nowhere near your level, oh to have such decisions, but I&#39;d go<br/>
with claw and drik, especially against casters as you&#39;ll disrupt more often<br/>
and those chunks of 7 misses in a row will hurt you less.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Weapons<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Decisions aplenty...I am a level 27 bard and I can&#39;t figure out which<br/>
weapons to use. I have a barbed leather whip, dragoon dirk, demon claws,<br/>
polished granite tomahawk, and screaming mace. I know I want to use my claws<br/>
just cause they look so cool ; ) but they can only be worn in primary hand<br/>
=( I am wondering if I should go for the dmg (barbed whip) or speed (dragoon<br/>
dirk)? My 1h blunt is pretty low (27) so in my mind I have probably already<br/>
ruled it out, and the PGT&#39;s shield skin song hurts more than helps at higher<br/>
levels since the first hit the mob gets in when it wears offis for dmg based<br/>
on your low agil. Any feedback would be appreciated!<br/>
