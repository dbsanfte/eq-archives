&gt; &gt;So...<br/>
&gt; &gt;Does anyone know if there is a helm comparable Banded that looks different<br/>
&gt; &gt;on Humans, and where might I get one?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looks are soo important.  I was wearing Banded, Loved the look, hated the<br/>
&gt; helm.  Of course, I hate anything that covers up my naturally boyish good<br/>
&gt; looks ;)  But in any case, when I upgraded to Bronze (I&#39;m only 19th, BTW -<br/>
&gt; Bronze isn&#39;t considered &quot;twinkie&quot; by this level, since so many people are<br/>
&gt; buying and selling it) that was the UGLIEST helm I&#39;d ever seen.  I looked<br/>
&gt; like the Rocketman :P  Fortunately, I had saved my Banded helm, and so I<br/>
&gt; went back to it - at least it was better than Bronze.  I understand<br/>
&gt; Rubicite follows the Bronze model, in which case, I may just dodge Rubi<br/>
&gt; helms, too :P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Anyone noticed almost every helm in the game is ugly? Definately every<br/>
plate helm is with the possible exception of the Trolls, which looks<br/>
vaguely ok. The only decent helm I&#39;ve found is the silk turban, which<br/>
doesn&#39;t show on your character at all. It has pretty decent AC but the<br/>
executioner&#39;s hood is so much better stat wise, and even the blackened<br/>
crown is probably more useful. The hood looks completely retarded on my<br/>
half elf though. It looks like I should have some wool mittens on<br/>
strings to go with it :)<br/>
<br/>
I usually just wear the BI Crown, dispite the donut head look. The extra<br/>
magic resists sure seem to help, as I rarely seem to take damage from<br/>
the casters in lower guk, and get rooted once in a blue moon compared to<br/>
most people down there.<br/>
