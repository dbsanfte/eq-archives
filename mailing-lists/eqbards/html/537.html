Having said that, this is pretty common quest that people do.  Once you <br/>
attain base standing with Stormguard (dwarven guards) from killing orcs, etc <br/>
You can do this quest.  A warrior dwarf in the way back of the warrior guild <br/>
in Kaladim will offer it, asking if you are Ready to serve, just say Yes I <br/>
am ready to serve and he&#39;ll tell you to get belts from orc cents in CB.  He <br/>
gives little exp, faction, and 3 to 4 sp and an item ranging from a bandage <br/>
to a 2 gp gem.  Very nice considering you&#39;ll probably run over there once <br/>
you have like 30 some odd belts saved up.  Imagine this as a secondary drum <br/>
quest for later lvls.<br/>
<br/>
Also the large tattered pad part of that quest seems to be broken for now, <br/>
so don&#39;t waste your pads on it yet.<br/>

I&#39;ve just arrived in Kaladim on my way to Kelethin and I&#39;m looking to make<br/>
a little coin. What is this Belt Quest that you speak of? Would a Bard of<br/>
the Seventh Circle be able to complete it?Journeyman Plastos<br/>
