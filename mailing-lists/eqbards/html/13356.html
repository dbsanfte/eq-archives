<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251900242"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Even if casters die more than bards (which is debatable), the<br/>
&gt;problem is that when casters die it&#39;s usually due to their own<br/>
&gt;stupidity.  When bards die, it&#39;s usually due to someone else&#39;s<br/>
&gt;stupidity.  I think I am just fine without bind, but you won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;see much opposition from me to getting bind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can say for a certainty that caster&#39;s at least in my guild do not die<br/>
anywhere near as much as other classes.  We have had 3 caster deaths that I<br/>
know of in the last 3 months.  I alone have died twice that many times.<br/>
Another bard in our guild died three times in one night due to stupid<br/>
groupmates.  I was luckier and only died twice due to the same groupmates.<br/>
One of our casters hasn&#39;t died in 5 levels.  He has only died 4 times in his<br/>
entire career up to around level 24.  They&#39;re average downtime after a death<br/>
is 4 minutes.  It takes me that long just to mem spells much less run back<br/>
to my corpse.  Granted the memming will be shorter, hopefully I won&#39;t find<br/>
out how much shorter tonite. ;-)<br/>
