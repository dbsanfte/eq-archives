<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049629877">My groups have killed loads of birdies in the pent house. If you fight them<br/>
out on the deck - you are fine.  Usually the puller would get just a bit<br/>
down the catwalk and the birdie would be at he very top.  All others in the<br/>
party are forced to be out on the deck and the birdies on the roost don&#39;t<br/>
agro. <br/>
<br/>
Hehe, the 3 avo spawns - wait til you see one of those!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s morons who come in while you are fighting and pull the room on top of<br/>
you that will give you more trouble.<br/>

		My experience in the top roost is that if there is a aviak<br/>
standing on the<br/>
		outside plus one on the inside right platform, attacking the<br/>
one outside<br/>
		will pull the one on the inside right platform.  I assumed<br/>
that it would<br/>
		take the three of us a long time to kill the avocet (I was<br/>
highest level<br/>
		character at 28 and the other 2 were melee types).  I also<br/>
assumed that the<br/>
		lament would wear off before we killed the avocet.  As a<br/>
result, I assumed<br/>
		the best way to ensure the aviak on the inside right<br/>
platform (harrier in<br/>
		this case) would not attack us during the middle of the<br/>
fight was to<br/>
		teleport to the ground.  Didn&#39;t actually think of fighting<br/>
it on the catwalk<br/>
		leading down from the top roost.<br/>
