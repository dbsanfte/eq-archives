<br/>
 </span></blockquote>* I would suggest starting out with bronze because it&#39;s easily available in the market areas.  Also, Ulrich McMannus in West Karana Barb village drops medium bronze...<br/>
<br/>
* Kill dragoon Zxytl and loot yourself a dirk -- easy kill at 46, it is a good piercer and it fits in the range slot when you get a better.  Always a market for resale too.<br/>
<br/>
* Cloak of the icebear, AC 8 and 20 cold resist -- 75-100 pp on Rodcet Nife (compare with LS Cloak with same AC for 200pp and you&#39;ll need the resists down the road anyway)  This drops off Karg and Martar Icebear -- I&#39;d just hang out in the area, kill wooly monmouths and auction for the cloak.  the tusks sell for around 10pp so you&#39;ll likely break even on the purchase.<br/>
<br/>
* 5 Dex/7 Cha rings.  they go for 90-150pp each.<br/>
<br/>
* Crystal fiber whip -- 8/26 and about 50pp in crystal caverns (on Rodcet Nife...).<br/>
<br/>
* Camp a few ancient coins for you bard.  Toughest ones for me to get were in Overthere and Kaesora...the other ones are pretty cheap to just buy.<br/>
<br/>
* Cured Tizmak is good armor (not the regular) -- gloves are AC 9 and some stats...tunic is AC 15 or so and very light.  Uncommon drops from Tizmaks in GD and all very green to a 46.  Careful tho, even greens will aggro with bad faction;-)<br/>
<br/>
* Hang out in EC and watch for desparate people trying to unload stuff at off peak hours -- I saw a pair of singing steel gauntlets go for 900pp last week...in EC you just never know;-)<br/>
