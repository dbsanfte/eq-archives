<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334298931">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
Now that we are getting messages when our song effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed that our snare song amost never lasts the full duration. Many times<br/>
it wears off as soon as I finish singing it.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of you were having the same problem and whether or<br/>
not this is by design or a bug that we should bring to the attention of the<br/>
powers that be.<br/>
