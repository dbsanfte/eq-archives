&gt; &gt;Okay - you just lost points there - but we&#39;ll forgive you.<br/>

&gt;You know, this was is my main, and I didn&#39;t know whether to take the name<br/>
&gt;thing seriously or not when I started... gotta live with it now ... duly noted<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh - it&#39;s not the silliness of the name.  Lord knows there&#39;s a million out <br/>
there, and if Bards can&#39;t have silly names, no one should (look at the bard <br/>
names Verant used: Justin Rhymes, Jeckel Enheid, Tommy Tutone....  There&#39;s <br/>
even a breastplate with Tommy Tutone&#39;s song on it - 867--5309!).  It&#39;s just <br/>
your choice.  Sheesh - wasn&#39;t there a better musician with the first name <br/>
of &quot;Rob&quot;? ;)<br/>
