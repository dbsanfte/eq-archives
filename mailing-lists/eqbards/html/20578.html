<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-83766283">The mask drops in Trakanon off the Harbinger (Don&#39;t remember the last <br/>
name).  If you kill enough Froglok Foragers and Hunters (level 45), <br/>
he or one of 11 other named mobs will spawn.  He&#39;s between 45 and 50 <br/>
(Blue to me at 51), and he&#39;s a tough SOB to pull.  I think I died 3 <br/>
times trying to coax him in, and in hindsight, I should have used <br/>
charm from the outset (after each rez, I obviously was limited <br/>
there...), but the biggest problem is all the aggro frogs in the <br/>
zone.  Almost all are green to me at 51, but it&#39;s tough to coax in a <br/>
45+ casting mob with 3 greens chipping at your ankles.  Selo&#39;s with <br/>
drum is too fast, selo&#39;s without drum is about right and just a plain <br/>
ole sow seems to work the best.  Except when he stops to nuke you. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent the last couple days there and it&#39;s a lot of fun.  The <br/>
foragers and hunters spawn fast (about 5 seconds after they die), and <br/>
we end up seeing quite a few rares after a couple hours.  Too bad <br/>
many of them drop NOTHING!  I was quite pissed last night after dying <br/>
2 or 3 times trying to pull Hierophant Lyxl, only to find he was <br/>
completely empty... he must have dropped it while chasing me :)<br/>
<br/>
In the past few days we&#39;ve looted an Iksar Ceremonial BP, some <br/>
leggings the Shaman put on, a Hangman&#39;s Noose, a Silken Cat Fur <br/>
Girdle, and a Trak Tooth.  No spells, but not a shabby treasure hoard <br/>
for the time invested. :)<br/>
