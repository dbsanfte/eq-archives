&gt;In my original post, I made the assumption that singing Selo&#39;s broke the<br/>
&gt;root for everyone in your group but I guess I could be wrong.  If I was<br/>
&gt;wrong then I guess I have to retract the first part of the post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Galtin<br/>
&gt;Bard and Master Brewer on E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Last night Roop (a fellow bard) and I were grouping with a party in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Highhold<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Pass fighting orcs.  After one particular tough battle, one of the <br/>
&gt;party<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;members stated that the fight would have been a lot easier if he hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;rooted the entire battle.  I then told him that had he informed the <br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that he was rooted, Roop or I could have easily broken him free with<br/>
&gt; &gt; Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually, I thought that Selo&#39;s only broke a root spell on the bard who<br/>
&gt; &gt; sings it, not on the party members. Any confirmation on this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Selo&#39;s DOES break root, so does SoW (but much slower), and I also hear <br/>
Journeyman Boots do.<br/>
<br/>
I used to hang in Unrest alot on the left side of the house. I would wait <br/>
for the designated fetcher at the door keeping it open for him. If he/she <br/>
yelles &quot;Rooted!&quot; I would run in and Selo&#39;s and break em free. It DOES work <br/>
on party members. The only thing that sucks is if they were sowed they will <br/>
need to have it refreshed. Not REALLY that big of an issue though. I&#39;ve had <br/>
to break myself free many times after getting hit by a ghoul or carrion <br/>
ghoul.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the SoW vs Selo&#39;s discussion goes - Selo&#39;s blows SoW out of the <br/>
water for travelling, but I find SoW to be best for fetching. Keeps things <br/>
simple, and you can sing other songs without worrying about Selo&#39;s. I hadn&#39;t <br/>
hung out with a good druid buddy of mine in awhile, and while we were <br/>
running thru E Commons tunnel i turned on Selo&#39;s. Next comment by him, &quot;Man <br/>
F*CK sow!!&quot; Blunt, but to the point.<br/>
<br/>
And GET a Dirk!!! If not to wield at least throw in your ranged weapon slot <br/>
for the stat buffs. I sold my barbed whip to use this, and am not even close <br/>
to disappointed. However, as I have seen someone else post on this list - I <br/>
would HIGHLY suggest not limiting yourself to 1 type of weapon skill. <br/>
Practice your 1H Slash, Piercing, AND Blunt. There are many great weapons of <br/>
each class that you will come across they higher level you get. I found out <br/>
the hard way. I just got a Staff of Writhing through trade, and my blunt <br/>
skill is 40. I can hardly hit with it. Hopefully I can get it maxed by the <br/>
time i am able to proc it<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
Safe travels to you!<br/>
