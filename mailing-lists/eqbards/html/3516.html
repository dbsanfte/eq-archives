<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995183082">My guild and I exist on the Bristlebane server, and we are always more than<br/>
happy to have another bard at our side.  I pity the foolish people that do<br/>
not understand the value of a bard.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m not as well travelled as you, server-speaking, but I am in a guild.<br/>
&gt;Our guild seems rather friendly when it comes to having non-guild members<br/>
&gt;group with us (on The Rathe).  I know there are lots of jerk-guilds out<br/>
&gt;there, but one thing you might try doing is asking a guild group that you<br/>
&gt;see if they can use you.   Chances are there&#39;s at least one bright person<br/>
