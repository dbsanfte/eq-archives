&gt;I&#39;m not as well travelled as you, server-speaking, but I am in a guild.<br/>
&gt;Our guild seems rather friendly when it comes to having non-guild members<br/>
&gt;group with us (on The Rathe).  I know there are lots of jerk-guilds out<br/>
&gt;there, but one thing you might try doing is asking a guild group that you<br/>
&gt;see if they can use you.   Chances are there&#39;s at least one bright person<br/>
