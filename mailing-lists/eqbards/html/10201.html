<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043484199"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: Gabryel &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gabryel@...">gabryel@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing that I was REALLY hoping to find in the song <br/>
&gt; analysis database<br/>
&gt; was more information about the actual damage statistics caused by DoT<br/>
&gt; songs such as CoD and DDD with instruments and without.  Considering I<br/>
&gt; rarely use weapons any more except in certain circumstances, <br/>
&gt; knowing the<br/>
&gt; damage that I am doing with these songs would help me better evaluate<br/>
&gt; which is better to use in a given situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing that would help Rokenn is if we all just test the damages<br/>
ourselves (and with a friend) and send them in.  Level, with instrument,<br/>
without instrument, appropriate skill level, etc, etc.  It would be REALLY<br/>
nice to find out what those damage formulas are.<br/>
