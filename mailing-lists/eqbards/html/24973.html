<div id="ygrps-yiv-64851993">Same thing with a quest in Skyshrine, can&#39;t remember which one but it has to<br/>
do with a princess in Wakening Lands, who was trained to the zone to<br/>
Skyshrine so you could simply zone back and forth all day.  Was huge<br/>
experience and faction, which both got nerfed bigtime.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; That&#39;s why the payment for JumJum damages quest guy was <br/>
&gt; changed to be a<br/>
&gt; deputy in Misty Thicket long ago.  Someone on this list at <br/>
&gt; the time trained<br/>
&gt; the original target right over next to the quest giver in <br/>
&gt; Rivervale and<br/>
&gt; stood there just hailing the two and doing the quest <br/>
&gt; thousands of times.<br/>
&gt; Some Guide saw what was happening and they fixed that the <br/>
&gt; very next patch.<br/>
