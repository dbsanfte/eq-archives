&gt; I had a little free time last night (took a break from all that running <br/>

&gt; disseminate this information to the bardic community.  I´┐¢d love to see <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  I&#39;ll add it to the guide I&#39;m putting together (since<br/>
it seems Goatanos is no longer updating his).  I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
have to add a credits section as well... :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By harmonizing the Rhythms songs, right now I can increase my party&#39;s magic <br/>
&gt; resist by 69, their AC by 16, and all the other resists by 23!  Woohoo, this <br/>
&gt; is not bad at all...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you sure?  Last I checked, Elemental and Purifying Rhythms<br/>
did not stack.  Guardian Rhythms will however stack with<br/>
either of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Jaxan&#39;s Jig O&#39; Vigor: I have taken up memming this song again lately, as <br/>
&gt; some long fights will really sap my fatigue.  This little gem is something I <br/>
&gt; only use once a fight, but I think it helps a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was a mob in Mistmoore that hit me with some oddball<br/>
spell I&#39;ve never heard of before that completely drained my<br/>
stamina.  I didn&#39;t have the Jig memorized, so I just switched<br/>
to instruments and let my party bash its brains out while I<br/>
waited for my stamina to regenerate naturally.  That&#39;ll teach<br/>
it for picking on a bard.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Cinda´┐¢s Charismatic Carillon and Tarew´┐¢s Aquatic Ayre:  <br/>
&gt; has anyone out there noticed any change in these songs<br/>
&gt; when using a wind instrument?  I sure haven´┐¢t.  Range<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>J.M. (Verant employee who used to be on this list) said an<br/>
instrument doesn&#39;t affect the Aquatic Ayre.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; seems to be the same, and with both songs it appears to be<br/>
&gt; all-or-nothing ´┐¢ either the song works completely or it<br/>
&gt; doesn´┐¢t.  Cinda´┐¢s usually raises faction one or two steps,<br/>
&gt; but I have seen a change from &quot;glowers dubiously&quot; to<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing using a flute either has no effect, increases the<br/>
duration, or increases the amount of faction increase.  (Btw,<br/>
the faction increase *will* help you complete quests like the<br/>
Squad Ring - I did it with my enchanter using the Alliance<br/>
spell, though it still took a helluva lot of belts and beads.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;amiable&quot;.  Strangely, the level of the NPC does not seem<br/>
&gt; to affect the success of this song.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because the song affects *you* not the NPC.  :-)  It<br/>
changes *your* faction with the target NPC&#39;s group.  It does<br/>
not affect the NPC at all.<br/>
<br/>
Just be careful you don&#39;t accidently try to Lament or charm<br/>
the merchant instead of using the Carillon.  The Carillon<br/>
produces an immediate message - if you don&#39;t immediately see<br/>
it, TURN THE SONG OFF BEFORE YOU&#39;RE KILLED!  :-)<br/>
