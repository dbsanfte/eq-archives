<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391306240">Agree 100% with everything you said.  My group consisted of five people (50,<br/>
48, 47, 43 and me at 37).  Almost everything we fought in Kaesora was blue<br/>
to me (and likely green to the high level folks).  In the time I was there<br/>
(6 hours), I got a total of 1.5 bubs of EXP.  We were also sharing spawns<br/>
with 2 other groups as well.  So even with a 10 level difference between me<br/>
and three others in my group, I got pretty good EXP.  Since we were doing a<br/>
guild raid, getting EXP wasn&#39;t even a concern.  But 1.5 bubs was enough for<br/>
me to ding into 38 so I was happy:-)  Now I just have to get back to<br/>
Kelethin somehow to get my new song.<br/>
<br/>
Agree with what you said about Kunark as well.  Guess it all goes back to<br/>
the risk vs reward issue Abashi posted about recently.  Those willing to<br/>
risk hunting in Kunark get to reap the rewards.  Since April, the only time<br/>
I have spent in the older zones was a guild raid in Kedge.  Other than that,<br/>
all my time has been spent in Kunark.  The main benefit this has resulted in<br/>
is that I level a lot faster now than I ever did pre-Kunark.  I have limited<br/>
playtime so as a result it takes me longer to level compared to the average<br/>
player.  Pre-Kunark it took me usually 2-3 weeks to gain a level.  Now it<br/>
only takes me 1-2 weeks.  Don&#39;t know if the primary reason for this is that<br/>
mobs give more EXP or the fact that overcrowding in Kunark is non-existant<br/>
and you can pull to your hearts desire.  Either way doesn&#39;t matter to me<br/>
because the game is a lot more fun to play now than it was prior to the<br/>
expansion.  <br/>

By and large, most people are afraid to go to kunark due to binding and<br/>
traveling issues.<br/>
<br/>
Experience in kunark dungeons is nothing short of amazing. We went to<br/>
Kaesora the last 3 nights. In 2 hours camping the Church area, I made 1.5<br/>
bubbles in level 44. We got a total 5 ransacker packs, and Xalgoz himself<br/>
spawned once, dropping the fang. The library area is awesome for levels<br/>
35-40 as everything is still blue. The drops are less frequent there but exp<br/>
is still great.<br/>
<br/>
This is also a great dungeon for crawling. You can get most mobs as single<br/>
or double pulls. There are many wanderers, but they are easy to isolate and<br/>
pick off. There are well spaced areas where you can pause to clear the next<br/>
area. And the spawn clock is enough so that you can clear an area and the<br/>
next area before respawn.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend Kaesora for parties levels 35-45. In the time I&#39;ve spent<br/>
there, I&#39;ve only once, seen someone not in my group in the dungeon.<br/>
