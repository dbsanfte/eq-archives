&gt; To some extent, at least the problems with paradigm, come with how<br/>
&gt; it was formed. They &quot;stole&quot; players from all the other guilds when<br/>
&gt; they were formed. Good ones. And they have never done anything (as<br/>
&gt; a guild. Individuals within Paradigm are fine. Others are idiots at<br/>
&gt; personal relations) that has made the other guilds want to forgive<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ashram called set up a Vox hunt for last Saturday night. He talked<br/>
&gt; to the other guilds, had outer-guild people participating, etc.<br/>
&gt; Paradigm took her down on Friday night. And no, Phoenix doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; yet have the fire resist gear to do Nagafen instead.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Yeah, we have the same thing on Sol Ro, with Paradigm and The Twelve<br/>
&gt; Moons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Both are fairly exclusive allowing only a small number of guests on hunts<br/>
&gt; &gt;and not really abiding by others who might try to call a dragon or plane<br/>
&gt; &gt;hunt. The bashing they receive is amazing though, and on a whole,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
