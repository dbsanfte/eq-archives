<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106410044"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have 46 to get through before I attempt the Planes - I want that margin! - but<br/>
&gt; that will be soon I hope.  I have read a few posts on the topic of Plane strategies,<br/>
&gt; but am eager for more.  Help me out please?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I got L50, hit hate, died about 10 times, got imbrued legs, went back<br/>
  to L49 and then now recently have L50 with a 2 bubble buffer.<br/>

  I learned one thing from hateplane.  When the puller is pulling, or<br/>
  something is incoming - make sure you arent playing any songs, or <br/>
  a multimob pull will rape you bad.<br/>
<br/>
  I used one song in hate, and that was manasong.  It&#39;s just too easy<br/>
  for mobs to train there, and you are the number one target if they<br/>
  see you playing songs.<br/>
