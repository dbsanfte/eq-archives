  I learned one thing from hateplane.  When the puller is pulling, or<br/>
  something is incoming - make sure you arent playing any songs, or <br/>
  a multimob pull will rape you bad.<br/>
<br/>
  I used one song in hate, and that was manasong.  It&#39;s just too easy<br/>
  for mobs to train there, and you are the number one target if they<br/>
  see you playing songs.<br/>

  Harm.</div>
