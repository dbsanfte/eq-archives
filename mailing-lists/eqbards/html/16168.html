forced to zone.  I either Chain (if fighting a single mob),<br/>
invis, and head for the zone.  Or I fear (if fighting multiple<br/>
mobs or casters), invis, and head for the zone.  Come to think<br/>
of it, aside from one really nasty incident involving the king<br/>
with a mithril 2h sword (killed me in about 12 seconds), I<br/>
haven&#39;t died in Lower Guk in months.  And I&#39;ve been spending a<br/>
lot of time soloing in there ever since I hit 48.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed a bug where 2h swords often will not<br/>
show up in a mob&#39;s hand, their attack messages say hit<br/>
(instead of slash), but the damage is for a 2h sword and they<br/>
have it when you loot them?<br/>
