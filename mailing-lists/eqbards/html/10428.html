<div id="ygrps-yiv-773404067"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m curious about other bards success kiting with level 20 and under<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you balance running out of range for such a long kite if your only<br/>
&gt; bellowing?  And if your using CoD or DDD how much success do you have<br/>
&gt; keeping from attracting other mobs and instakill NPC&#39;s?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try to pull somewhere where there isn&#39;t anything around: a good place to do<br/>
this at our level (I&#39;m 21L bard) is in EK - where the Gnoll Reavers and<br/>
Undead Reavers spawn (out by that big stone pillar thing - not sure the<br/>
loc - I just know that if you start from the chain bridge and keep the water<br/>
on your left... there will be this place where two roads meet and its<br/>
visible from there as long as it isn&#39;t raining). Fire up selos with the drum<br/>
and all you have to do is just run by them and slow long enough for them to<br/>
come after you (Try to not pull more than two Gnolls OR one Undead - much<br/>
less down time). Then I run back near the water because the wandering<br/>
reavers only come out so far - and there isn&#39;t that much that goes by the<br/>
water.... When you pull them back to the water try to avoid anything that<br/>
might join in the chase on the way back, but sometimes a puppy or two (wolf)<br/>
might come too... then, because selos with drum is fast and you got to your<br/>
spot WAY before those slow reavers - you have time to switch to the<br/>
lute/brass and get ready to start beating on them with the songs!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how I put my hotkey bank for them:<br/>
<br/>
DDD          CoD<br/>
Hymn        Melee Slot<br/>
Inventory    Inventory<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this will come thru but here&#39;s a cut of the hotkey bank from a screen shot I took:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully you guys can see this... if not, and you want to see, I can send it to anyone privately.... Good hunting and safe journeys!<br/>
