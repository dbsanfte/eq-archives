&gt;what is a DT?  remember, no such thing as a stupid question =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i actually only fought Cazic once, right after they buffed him up and we got<br/>
&gt;our asses kicked.  and i&#39;ve never done innoruuk.  just dragons and draco.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>DT = Death touch. Cazic used to just death touch the first person that<br/>
attacked him, and that was always announced by a zone wide shout of the<br/>
person&#39;s name, aka Cazic thule shouts &#39;GENDAL&#39;. And gendal was dead. But<br/>
recently they changed it so as to prevent people autopulling. <br/>
<br/>
Autopulling was created when for example, you tried to pull the fetid fiend<br/>
house. 3 ff&#39;s would start to follow you and oh look, there is a scareling.<br/>
Well, ff&#39;s move darn slow and scarelings move darn fast, so by the time you<br/>
got back to camp just the scareling was with you. The ff&#39;s fall behind and<br/>
eventually give up and wander back home if you just run flat out with sow<br/>
on (never mind selos heh). BUT the ff&#39;s did NOT forget you. Matter of fact,<br/>
they are prett pissed at you, and are currently telling their next door<br/>
neighbors the tentacle tormentors about you. So next time you go back,<br/>
before you are even within the normal agro range 3 tt&#39;s and 3 ffs would be<br/>
busting out at you. So you run back as fast as you can and this time only<br/>
the 3 tts came since they are slight faster than the ff&#39;s. By now the the<br/>
ff&#39;s have basically told the entire zone about you, and anytime you even<br/>
get remotely close to something it will come charging at you. This was<br/>
great, and made pulling pretty easy and safe. <br/>
<br/>
Verant did not like this of course so they come up with a solution... the<br/>
zone wide cazic dt. Once cazic starts to hear that you are in the zone from<br/>
his minions, he will start taking names and calling them out one by one<br/>
till everybody that is on his list is dead. You CAN resist his dt if you<br/>
are not with in melee range, and harmshield/divine aura will protect you<br/>
from it (its a testament to how often my necro was dt&#39;d that he resisted it<br/>
twice and was protected once by harmshield). However, if cazic misses one<br/>
dt, you can be assured he will just call out your name 30 seconds later.<br/>
And if you are within melee range of cazic, nothing will save you, its<br/>
instant, non resistable, no nvul protection death. <br/>
<br/>
The dt&#39;s are super demoralizing but man it feels great when you finally do<br/>
get to kill him :)<br/>
