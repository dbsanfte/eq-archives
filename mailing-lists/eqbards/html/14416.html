&gt;Yes, I pointed that out in the Ask the Archmage thread.  I<br/>
&gt;said the song seems to be tuned for PvP instead of PvM, and<br/>
&gt;asked if it could be retuned to be effective in PvM as well.  <br/>
&gt;Unfortunately, comparing what I read in the original thread<br/>
&gt;and seeing GZ&#39;s replies, it appears he ignored every question<br/>
&gt;that could be construed to imply that something wasn&#39;t working<br/>
&gt;right.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was my feeling as well.  I was especially annoyed by his response to<br/>
Parry however.  We do have better magic than other hybrids, but not as much<br/>
better as their melee skills are above ours.  The ranger in my group just<br/>
made the same level as me.  He has 20% more hp&#39;s than I do and slightly<br/>
better AC.  He has worse equipment base AC wise than I do and the same<br/>
Agility so I&#39;m not sure how he gets a better AC out of it.  We dueled and it<br/>
was unbelievable.  He had me down to less than two bubbles before I could do<br/>
a half bubble to him.  He never cast a single spell on me other than one<br/>
snare to make sure I didn&#39;t run around.  Our weapon combo is exactly the<br/>
same, PGT and Dragoon Dirk.  His base AC from armor pieces is 27 points<br/>
below mine, but his modified AC is 11 pts higher.  He had his buffs on him<br/>
and I had mine on me.  He resisted Lullaby about 15% of the time outright,<br/>
and never missed a single attack because of it he said.  He couldn&#39;t even<br/>
tell if it was affecting him or not.<br/>
<br/>
Not that this is an end all- be all argument for us to get improved melee<br/>
skills, but they have improved the other hybrids melee skills more than once<br/>
since release, while ours have stayed the same.<br/>
