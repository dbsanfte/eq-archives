<div id="ygrps-yiv-382087299">Bards are more restricted in hand to hand than their other skills. Its<br/>
3xlvl+3. So a lvl 10 bard can have a maximum hand to hand skill of 33.<br/>
Also certain skills bards can only raise to 40. This includes forage,<br/>
sneak, safe fall, and probably a few others like track and pick locks.</div>
