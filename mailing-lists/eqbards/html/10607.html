<b>Subject:</b> Bards as NPCs to fight <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043815108">It seems a reasonably obvious assumption that the reason why there are no<br/>
froglok bards etc.  or any bards other than in guildhalls or mail delivery is<br/>
that there is NO combat AI for NPC bards.  they are treated as a<br/>
Warrior/rogue/monk with our poor melee skills.<br/>
<br/>
my (slapped together) justifications for this:<br/>
1.  When charmed, we Punch, or melee with whatever we have equipped.  I have<br/>
not seen or heard of a bard play a single song while charmed.<br/>
2.  the Mail delivery bards just stand there and punch when they are attacked.<br/>
<br/>
so, it is safe to assume that the AI does not consider the bard&#39;s songs, and is<br/>
not equipped to actually use them in any capacity.  I (being in a guild called<br/>
&quot;Wave of the Dark Tide&quot;) have friends who kill the Postmen (notably Travis Two<br/>
Tone in Nektulos forest) for XP.  They are like killing guards, but easier<br/>
because they are not warrior Paladin or SK.  (in case you were curious, Travis<br/>
is lvl 25 and an easy kill, but the faction hits are a bummer :-) )<br/>
<br/>
What a surprise it will be for the Postmen slayers if they ever implement the<br/>
necessary logic for the bard songs into the AI.  Heh...i wanna see a 25+ necro<br/>
get fear kited around Nektulos.....(i know that travis would not have screech<br/>
at lvl 25, but how often does that stop an NPC caster?)<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
