&gt; &gt;I just subscribed to this list, but I was wondering if any of you<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; PGT  The Tomahawk. It starts to Proc at level 10 and looks<br/>
&gt; like a COOL axe!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on how much cash you have.  The PGT is a good starter<br/>
weapon.  Most people end up buying a combine longsword at your<br/>
level though.  Other good alternatives are a barbed leather<br/>
whip and a gladius.  I&#39;ve seen both of these selling for less<br/>
than 100pp now, and they&#39;re quite a bit better than a combine.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bronze armor seems to be the right armor for this level. If you can get<br/>
&gt; (MUCH) money for it -- step up to steel. Same AC, lower weight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh.  When I was level 12, I was in leather.  Didn&#39;t get full<br/>
banded until 16, didn&#39;t get full bronze until low 20s.  Bronze<br/>
armor comes mostly from low 20s mobs.  That it&#39;s available at<br/>
level 12 is testament to how screwed up the economy is.  The<br/>
&quot;next step&quot; is level 30s armor - stuff from Sol A/B, Lower<br/>
Guk, the Lambent quests (which require trips into Sol A/LGuk),<br/>
etc.  Unless you can scrouge up the cash for steel plate, or<br/>
pay/talk someone into twinking you (which is actually likely<br/>
considering the number of people now into their 40s looking<br/>
to get rid of this stuff), you&#39;re going to be with that bronze<br/>
for a long long time.<br/>
