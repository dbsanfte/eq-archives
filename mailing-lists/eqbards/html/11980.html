 </span></blockquote>If you don&#39;t mind my asking, just where the heck do you FIND seven HGs.  In the last four days, I&#39;ve seen<br/>
exactly three, and one of them was dead.  I have also seen zero Griffons.  The new Gnolls are fully<br/>
camped, the Spectres have three groups sitting around the lake, Kithicor is (as I predicted) utterly<br/>
uncamped yet still a killer to move through half the time.  Bah!  I hate being level 35 on an aging and<br/>
crowded server.<br/>
