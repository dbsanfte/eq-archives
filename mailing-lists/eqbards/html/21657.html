<div id="ygrps-yiv-207109532">Just a wee caveat to Giant hunting at the fortress in FM:<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT!!! (I can&#39;t stress this enough)  DO NOT stand in line of sight with<br/>
the fortress entrance and sing Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what happened in the past couple of days, but when I stand on<br/>
the slope a little ways from the entrance and sing Hymn, we start to get<br/>
faction hits from other groups and Giants come running out to come pound on<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I proved it to my group yesterday.  A Giant popped in the doorway.  We were<br/>
our usual safe distance away from the fort.  The group were all sitting<br/>
medding and healing.  I started Hymn for ONE pulse, and the Tump came<br/>
bounding out.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I speed in to the fort to pull.  Now I don&#39;t even have to move!<br/>
<br/>
Later on, however, I was with a group to the right side of the entrance,<br/>
beside the flagpole.  The spot we chose was actually closer than the slope<br/>
earlier, yet I could Hymn away to my heart&#39;s content without aggroing a<br/>
single mob.<br/>
