<div id="ygrps-yiv-863194621">Since you are a bard I hope you can answer this question for me.  What level<br/>
did you see an improvement in damage, (when did you start doing more than<br/>
(2xdmg)+1.  I have heard so many different stories I don&#39;t know who to<br/>
believe.  I have a strength of 90 base, and 102 with songs.  Does the<br/>
strength effect the damage, or is based on skill points, or what.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any response you could offer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I still have stuff on MY wish list hehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i personally like looks over stats so i wear a full set of rubicite<br/>
&gt; (except<br/>
&gt; for the awful helm).  mithril breastplate is better chestpiece from<br/>
&gt; solusek<br/>
&gt; B if you want stats (ac17 15AGI).  mithril bracers from sol B (ac4 wis5<br/>
&gt; str3) or serpentine bracers from the reanimated hand in lower guk (ac1<br/>
&gt; dex3<br/>
&gt; agi9) are also better for stats.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i am using a silvery war axe and crystalline blade as weapons.  i have a<br/>
&gt; staff or writhing in the bank.  what i want is a couple short swords of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; ykesha (can duel wield dmg8 del24 casts 75dmg proc), which takes anywhere<br/>
&gt; from 8 to 12 level 45+ people to get off the ghoul lord in lower guk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the jewelry that can be made is very nice.  golden amber earrings (plus 3<br/>
&gt; STR each) golden opal amulet (9STA 6AGI) and silver ruby veil (4STR 4WIS).<br/>
&gt; i don&#39;t feel like spending the money yet, but a platinum ruby veil is 7STR<br/>
&gt; 7WIS.  and a black pearl choker is i think 7DEX 7AGI but i like the<br/>
&gt; stamina<br/>
&gt; boost on the opal amulet.  jagged bands from the ghost in unrest are nice<br/>
&gt; rings, still haven&#39;t found anything better.  dwarven work boots from the<br/>
&gt; same ghost would be a stat improvement but look like chainmail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; since i hate head graphics, i wear a fine silk turbin that comes off the<br/>
&gt; Sand Giant Hatar in Oasis or North Ro.  i would like the crown of the<br/>
&gt; froglok king from lower guk though, no graphics and better stats.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i still don&#39;t have a troll hide belt from upper guk but would love one or<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; flowing black silk sash from lower guk (still wearing a purity belt LOL).<br/>
&gt; like i said still lots of stuff on my wish list too.  for a level 50 i<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have anything real special, but i like my items and my appearance, and can<br/>
&gt; now go after some stuff I want without worrying about experience or<br/>
&gt; levelling, which is nice and a relief.  my str, dex, and agi are all over<br/>
&gt; 100, and i get plenty of buffs from songs or group members (clerics,<br/>
&gt; shaman,<br/>
&gt; etc).  i&#39;ve given a lot of better items that i can use to my friends, or<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; my paladin sister Erisi ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so from now on i will just go after stuff i want but don&#39;t have, just have<br/>
&gt; fun, and help others out.  gimme a tell if you need anything, if i am free<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ll come =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hail,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Someone said Shada made L50, congratz! I was going to ask the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Xegony L50 <br/>
&gt; &gt; bard some questions but he has gone to ground apparently. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; have not turned <br/>
&gt; &gt; him up on a who list all weekend. Perhaps Shada can tell us <br/>
&gt; &gt; what weapons and <br/>
&gt; &gt; armor to put on our wish lists. :)<br/>
