Bard != Tank<br/>
<br/>
No wonder you&#39;re having such a hard time there.  Mind you, it CAN be done.<br/>
But we&#39;re not nearly as good a tank as a Ranger/Pally/Warrior etc.  They<br/>
just have more hp, better defenses, especially once we get out of our teens.<br/>
It&#39;s amazing what parry, dodge and higher defense caps do for the melee<br/>
classes.  Bards are more of a caster than Melee :(<br/>
<br/>
My best advice in your situation is get someone, ANYONE to run a ranger ;)<br/>
It&#39;s the best of the Melee classes in terms of downtime.  And at 39th they<br/>
get SoW so they&#39;re not consigned to the &quot;long walk home&quot; forever.  Without a<br/>
real tank in your group you&#39;re pretty much hurting :(  And a Ranger isn&#39;t<br/>
even a REAL tank.  Pally, SK, Warrior (and maybe Rogue) are tanks.  Ranger<br/>
is a good alternative though.  I&#39;d put a bard as primary tank before I would<br/>
a monk but that&#39;s about it.  Monks are good quisinarts, bad at tanking ;)<br/>
<br/>
As a tank I&#39;ve found my best song combo is HoR *yes it still helps a lot*,<br/>
Anthem, Psalm of Warmth/Cooling *(you could use one of the rhythm lines or<br/>
Bellow).<br/>
the HoR will act as a mild taunt.  Psalm gives you a decent dmg shield which<br/>
will stack with whatever your caster dumps on you.  If you use Rhythms that<br/>
will drastically reduce the dmg you take from casters.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck :(  Being a tank-bard isn&#39;t fun at all.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I wish I could follow this advice, but I&#39;d have to find another group to<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; so.  chains seems to interfere with the much more effective darkness line<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; necro spells so they don&#39;t want me to do that.  We actually have to tell<br/>
&gt; this cleric how to play.  If we don&#39;t continually remind him he goes back<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; his old ways.  Smite till OOM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a good note I have been able to get Lament to work on the gobs.  Its<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; difficult but it does work.  No pulling thru Lamented mobs here though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll have to try the all instrument option again if I decide to come out<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; retirement.  I tried it once and promptly died in the first fight because<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; had 2 inferno gobs beating on just me.  If we had a real tank there might<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; some hope, but generally I&#39;m it.  When I get there I have even been the<br/>
&gt; first tank to arrive.  The main reason they like having me in the group is<br/>
&gt; they all know that means they move one further down on the &#39;get killed&#39;<br/>
&gt; list.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll agree but SolA is a bard killing ground.  I love that zone as a<br/>
Ranger.<br/>
&gt; As a Bard it&#39;s suicide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Several reasons:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For some reason the Goblins in SolA are completely impervious to Lament<br/>
&gt; (Annoying!!!!) even if it says they&#39;re sad they&#39;ll still come after you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Goblins in general have a seriously low tolerance for music.  I&#39;ve found<br/>
&gt; that almost ANYTHING you sing there will get them aggro on you (even<br/>
&gt; whistling warsong, our self-only buff).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s indoor (no running away).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pathing is a nightmare:  VERY easy to pull a monster train if you don&#39;t<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; how to pull there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That being said,  if the cleric is that much of an ass I&#39;d just find<br/>
another<br/>
&gt; group to hunt with.  You don&#39;t tell him how to be a cleric, he shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tell you how to be a bard.  If it gets you attacked more than him who<br/>
cares,<br/>
&gt; you aren&#39;t a half bad tank (esp since they fixed the bash-bug on MOBS) :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I use the following strategy in SolA:  Bind, HoR, DDD, CoD.  It gets me a<br/>
&gt; LOT of attention but I am gonna get it anyway, I might as well hurt<br/>
EVERYONE<br/>
&gt; that attacks me.  (I use pure instruments).  Thus I slow down our<br/>
opponents<br/>
&gt; by 30%, hurt them all at around hmm 60hp/tic and heal us all at about<br/>
&gt; 12-13hp/tic.  Generally the primary tank has no problem keeping the<br/>
&quot;Current<br/>
&gt; target&quot; locked on himself, I get the rest, we kill them one at a time.  By<br/>
&gt; the time we kill the 2nd goblin the rest are starting to either drop dead<br/>
&gt; from the DOT&#39;s I&#39;m singing or are at 1/3 life and are nearly dead when we<br/>
&gt; get to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It works out very well, our group has miniscule downtime.  The<br/>
&gt; cleric/druid/whatever concentrates only on healing me, I keep the tank<br/>
&gt; healed during combat with HoR.  Since our opponents are slowed and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; healing I can actually heal him faster than he takes dmg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It takes a while to prove yourself in SolA because you ARE such a huge<br/>
&gt; target.  But I submit that you will be a huge target in that zone<br/>
REGARDLESS<br/>
&gt; of what you sing.  So enjoy yourself ;)  If you&#39;re going to die, you may<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; well have fun doing it ;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would try that, but the cleric would probably just let me die to prove<br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; &gt; point.  In Sol A it is a big taunt.  If I play Hymn and my two other<br/>
songs<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; definitely get the bulk of the attention.  The last 6 times we have had<br/>
&gt; &gt; deaths in our Sol A groups, on 5 of them the deaths have gone like this.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1st death: me, 2nd death: other bard (lower level), 3rd death: other<br/>
melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; person.  The two bards have died a combined 15 times in our Sol A guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups.  The other guildmembers have died a grand total of 6 times<br/>
&gt; combined.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Every time there is a bad pull or we get trained its the bards that pay<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; price.  On one occasion the enchanter got waxed first by a wizard, but<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; &gt; were not far behind even then.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hmm sounds like you&#39;re letting your group dictate how to play your<br/>
class.<br/>
&gt; &gt; DONT buy into it.  You know how to be a bard better than they do.  Hymn<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; NOT that big a taunt.  Especially in today&#39;s dungeons.  They&#39;re _hardly_<br/>
&gt; &gt; dangerous.  I can walk the entire length of lower guk, live to dead<br/>
side,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I might actually pull a train of 3 critters.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Play your class the way you think it should be played.  Generally I find<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; who&#39;s doing what and then I go, OK, I&#39;m going to be doing X.  If they<br/>
&gt; argue<br/>
&gt; &gt; I simply state &quot;You be a (insert class here), I&#39;ll be a Bard.  If you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; like it, lets trade accounts&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That usually shuts them up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bottom line:  You play your character, don&#39;t let others tell you how :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Our enchanter seems to have no trouble keeping both tanks Alacrity&#39;d<br/>
&gt; thru<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the night and still does crowd control.  Yes I could give us all a<br/>
&gt; &gt; speedup,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but since the only other person even meleeing is a cleric it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; help<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much.  My finger-twiddling is much better spent on Chant of Battle if<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanter is there to Alacrity.  If he&#39;s not then Anthem gets back in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mix.  If bards excel at anything its that we can fill in as a<br/>
substitute<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just-about-anything.  Problem I&#39;m starting to find is that I&#39;m only<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get into groups that are lacking something if there isn&#39;t a person<br/>
&gt; looking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to group who&#39;s better at that thing as a primary role.  When I do get<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lately its always as a tank.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Last 3 nites:  Don&#39;t chain, we&#39;re darknessing.  Don&#39;t anthem we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; alacritying.  Don&#39;t Chant we&#39;re skin like something or othering.<br/>
Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hymn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or you&#39;ll get too much attention and die.  Didn&#39;t leave much of<br/>
anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me to do but swing, bellow and go owie.  Occasionally we&#39;d pull a<br/>
wizard<br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shaman gobie and I&#39;d throw the resistances in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Towards the end of the night I get asked in group tell, &quot;Can&#39;t you do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything but Bellow?  I thought bards had all kinds of cool songs.&quot;<br/>
My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reply?  Didn&#39;t have one, told them &quot;I am retiring to the OOT to<br/>
&gt; &gt; contemplate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; life while beating head on gargoyles for a while.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Swift Like the Wind costs a LOT of mana, and doesn&#39;t last as long as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the lower level speed up buff. Add onto this that there is a speed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond which a weapon can&#39;t get any faster. And Swift Like the Wind,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in higher levels, isn&#39;t even used on people with haste sashes. Not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; worth it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So. Sometimes a minor speedup is good enough.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Quicken is very definitely a combat buff. And fairly high mana.<br/>
Grouped,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d put it on my main tank and let a bard handle the speedup for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rest, preferring to use mana for crowd control, or other circumstances<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than keeping everyone Quickened.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because it is better does not mean that it is always the best<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; use of the enchanter&#39;s mana. Bards ARE Still needed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;---------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Target: Increase Attack Speed +160.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Description:Great for tanks when grouped. Increases the amount of<br/>
times<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;will hit in a round against an enemy. In large/long battles it can<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;huge difference. Quite deadly when used in conjunction with Languid<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Pace/Tepid Deeds. Combine these 2 spells when possible.. talk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about breaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the odds. Slows down your opponent, increases your attack rate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This spell doesn&#39;t stack with Augmentation, but as such it provides<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;double the attack speed for the target and is usually preferred<br/>
anyway.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;other important thing is that this spell helps increase combat skill<br/>
&gt; gain<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;since you are making more skill rolls with your attack.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;----------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;So, when SLTW &quot; provides over double the attack speed &quot; - it hardly<br/>
&gt; &gt; matters<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;if VoV does a 35.271% increase or a 36.983% increase.  Enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;speed buffs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;are where it&#39;s at.  I use Warsong because my enchanter wont give me<br/>
