<div id="ygrps-yiv-409895943">Can anyone tell me the use of qeusts? I completed the string quest at the <br/>
qeynos bard guild and only got 2 copper, some faction hits and a litle bit <br/>
of exp for about a 1,5 hour walk. That was when i was a low level ( at +- 7 <br/>
), now i am 11 and recently moved to freeport,i love selo&#39;s and the drum, my <br/>
shadowknight friend (who&#39;s not as evil as you migth think) was very jealous, <br/>
he walked twice as long as i did from qeynos to freeport :)...<br/>
<br/>
But i&#39;m drifting of, can you tell me what the reward for most quests is, <br/>
because walking for 1,5 hour and getting 2 copper is not worth it.<br/>
And getting exp figthing is much cooler than running.<br/>
