<br/>
Here is a use for Lullaby that only desperate circumstances suggested to me.<br/>
<br/>
My 16 bard was fighting with a 15 druid in East Karana, where it opens up<br/>
from the Gorge zone entrance. I was pulling and tanking. She was blasting<br/>
and healing. :) (I did warn her if she got something stuck on her I couldn&#39;t<br/>
taunt it off. We seemed to do a good job of balancing damage though so that<br/>
never really became a problem.)<br/>
<br/>
I had, on my first panel,<br/>
1 Anthem     2 Chords<br/>
3 Purifying  4 Bellow<br/>
5 Heal       6 Assist<br/>
<br/>
On the second panel<br/>
1 Selo&#39;s     2 Heal<br/>
3 Jig        4 Bellow<br/>
5 Inc social 6 Shurikens (more damage/range than throwing daggers)<br/>
<br/>
I had Lullaby memmed in the eight song slot, but not in any of<br/>
my hot key panels.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, We had a lion patriarch come up and chew on our backsides<br/>
while we were taking out a gorge hound. Or rather, chew on MY backside.<br/>
I took the gorge hound out at 2 bubbles and a bit of health. Turned<br/>
to engage the lion, praying my groupmate was sending a heal my way,<br/>
when I saw the yellow text: Krilled went Linkdead.<br/>
<br/>
Um. I threw up Selo&#39;s and headed for zone. :) But the lion kept hitting<br/>
me from behind and stunning me. My life was down to 1 bubble -- FAR into<br/>
the &quot;slow you down even running fast&quot; category.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to try the song that doesn&#39;t work. Click on Lullaby. A tick later<br/>
&quot;a lion patriarch&#39;s head nods&quot; Great! Click on Selo&#39;s, run for zone. It<br/>
allowed<br/>
me to get far enough ahead the lion did not catch up again until I was one<br/>
step<br/>
from zone. And then I just went ahead and stepped into the zone.</div>
