<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030607976"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You&#39;ll miss out on any of the better druids then. Playing the way you<br/>
&gt; ask is suicidal in the long run for cleric types, as it means your<br/>
&gt; offence and defence skills stagnate, as you never get a chance to get<br/>
&gt; improvements. This means when they get the inevitable frenzy occurs from<br/>
&gt; casting that heal they get ripped up because they have such low defence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  They can practice on their own time.  Not on the group&#39;s.  If a<br/>
  L50 cleric doesn&#39;t have his defense max&#39;d by now, that&#39;s his<br/>
  fault, not mine.  I made sure I max&#39;d all my offense/defense<br/>
  skills between L39 and L44.  A cleric is there to heal, not<br/>
  to take hits.  I&#39;m surprised you&#39;d even suggest it as such.<br/>
  Even if somehow the cleric was under attack, most tanks I <br/>
  group with are instantly on the mob, or the enchanter has<br/>
  it mez&#39;d in less than a few seconds.  You probably should<br/>
  rethink this counterpoint some.  You are implying that healers<br/>
  should attack in battle, so that they can take dmg and raise<br/>
  their defense.  I&#39;m not sure many people will agree with you<br/>
  on this.  I for one don&#39;t.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Cough cough. Double attack mean anything to you? I think you&#39;ll find a<br/>
&gt; similarly equipped ranger would make your melee look like the joke it<br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s true, I never said I was a better meleer than the<br/>
  other tank classes.  However, I do notice the difference <br/>
  when I don&#39;t melee.  I am certain I am doing a fair ammount<br/>
  of damage, when the monsters stick on me about 25% of the <br/>
  time.  And I&#39;m only playing manasong (Nil taunt).  I proc<br/>
  Yks about 5-8 times every battle, that is a huge amount of<br/>
  damage that double attack just doesn&#39;t make up for.  I rate<br/>
  the ammount of dmg I&#39;m doing based on how long a monster<br/>
  is attacking just me.  But I never said I always or often<br/>
  outdmg the tanks, unless I have lots and lots of dex/speed<br/>
  buffs.  If they had the same buffs, they would then outdmg<br/>
  me.  There is no song that we have that warrants you not<br/>
  using your weapons at this high a level.<br/>
