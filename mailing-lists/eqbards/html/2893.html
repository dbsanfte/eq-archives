<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419677856">In Unrest I disagree with &quot;bard hate&quot;. I&#39;ve played there a few weeks, spending<br/>
most of my time inside the mansion as a puller. I&#39;ll tell you that if you either<br/>
attack something or something punches you while fighting someone else, if you<br/>
lose track of it and are not sure if it dies, you need to zone out to clear your<br/>
agg. list. There are a few line of sight bugs in the house that can cause this<br/>
very easily. Another thing that causes it is if you are within range of a party<br/>
fighting a mob or someone runs a train to the zone, and you are healing or<br/>
buffing your party within range. The monster generally won&#39;t come after you, but<br/>
it will remember. After the person it has chased has zoned, it will generally go<br/>
to the first floor front hallway, where the mobs will pile up, as some of the<br/>
pathfinding to get back to the second floor is problematic. As soon as someone<br/>
attacks one of those mobs piled up in the front hall, that one that had you on<br/>
it&#39;s agg list will come for you, and he will likely tell his buddies in the<br/>
front why they should come help him kill you.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a puller, and you ever go into the open space next to the fireplace<br/>
on second floor, and a dry bones casts on you that isn&#39;t in the room, you need<br/>
to zone out. He is actually in the loft up the middle stairwell of the house.<br/>
The railing in the room causes a bug so he can&#39;t come down after you, but the<br/>
dry will tell the barbed, werebat, and CGs that spawn there. Under certain<br/>
conditions these monsters are able to run out of the room, and if they do, they<br/>
will all pathfind to you, no matter where you are in Unrest, UNLESS you have<br/>
zoned. Your party doesn&#39;t need to zone as long as they are out of the dry bones&#39;<br/>
range, just you.<br/>
<br/>
I thought bard hate was the issue when I was at Derv camps in my mid-teens, but<br/>
it was simply a matter of me not zoning after several hours of play. I don&#39;t<br/>
understand all the specifics of &quot;why&quot;, but as soon as you zone everything pretty<br/>
much ignores you in Unrest. If you have problems with beetles running up, zoning<br/>
helps with that as well immensely.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some,<br/>

&gt; I think the mobs in Unrest just hate us.  I can be inside the zone about 30<br/>
&gt; minutes before I have a random mob attack me from nowhere, whether I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; playing a song or not and no matter which songs I&#39;ve played in the zone.  I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t seen this in any other zone, and thankfully they&#39;ve always come when<br/>
&gt; we were ready to pull anyway so it saved us some work.  It&#39;s a weird<br/>
&gt; phenomenon that I have yet to understand.  If anyone has any clues about<br/>
&gt; this I would appreciate it, I hope to be going back there next week to<br/>
&gt; tackle the basement.<br/>
