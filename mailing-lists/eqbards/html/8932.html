out of trouble.  As forthe pet commands I should have those down pat since<br/>
my alternate character is a Magician.  I will have to head to everfrost<br/>
then, since I will most definitely want to kill them mammoths to earn some<br/>
cash for some nice armour and other things for other guild members.<br/>
