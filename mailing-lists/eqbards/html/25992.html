<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305080125">My guild came to the conclusion that Kael drops are so rare that it&#39;s not<br/>
worth putting a priority into Kael for anything other than getting CoV<br/>
Faction (and of course the &quot;Big Boys&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Get your CoV faction up - and good resist gear - then move to the Halls of<br/>
Testing in ToV and you&#39;ll be very pleased with the Quest Armor drop rates.<br/>
It&#39;s streaky so you can have some nights where you&#39;ll on see two or three<br/>
drops in a five hour raid - but you&#39;ll have other nights where you&#39;ll get 15<br/>
or 16.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Kael armor drops...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK been hunting kael weekly for quite some time...<br/>
<br/>
Plate seems to be a rare drop.  We hunt Arena area and King Torm area.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for specific areas or mobs that drop more plate?  I have<br/>
heard tell of a &quot;plate rotation&quot; but I don&#39;t know what it is or what the<br/>
mobs are in the rotation.  But it does get called as a camp on our server<br/>
and I&#39;ve yet to hear any info on it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time,<br/>
<br/>
