&gt; You know... this is odd.  Did any of the bard related patches actually make<br/>
&gt; it into the game!?!  I received no &quot;charm broken&quot; messages last night as<br/>
&gt; well (although, I should point out that I only used charm 2 or 3 times<br/>
&gt; during heavy combat - it&#39;s possible that I missed it).<br/>

undead ghoul frogloks for up to 9 points damage last night in<br/>
between charms.  :)<br/>

I think that&#39;s why they made our instruments magical.  They<br/>
could make our punches magical via magical gloves, but having<br/>
a non-magical instrument equipped overrode that.  So I think<br/>
they fixed it by just making all our instruments magical, then<br/>
made a big deal about it in the patch message.<br/>
