<div id="ygrps-yiv-532055962">Last night I acquired the fixin&#39;s for two of the bard quests (arms and<br/>
boots), but when I got to the Temple, another bard told me that all the<br/>
bard quests were broken, according to a GM, and that nobody could find<br/>
Genni, the person who makes the lambent gems, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Did people have trouble making any of the pieces of armour besides the<br/>
previously mentioned breastplate problems? <br/>
