<b>Subject:</b> Bards vs Enchanters Part 2 with a little Lullaby thrown in (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-193031500">So what you are saying is that because pathing is screwed up at the top of<br/>
the temple, mobs standing on the steps will not move down to the bottom of<br/>
the steps and attack anyone standing there?  That may explain why I rarely<br/>
got attacked.  I was standing at the bottom of the steps along with the<br/>
cleric and enchanter.  The other three characters were on the steps<br/>
meleeing. <br/>
<br/>
I also wonder what actually happens when two bards sing lullaby in terms of<br/>
the mobs resisting.  Using my lizzie fight as an example, I started the<br/>
fight by putting 10 mobs to sleep with no resist messages.  The only mob<br/>
attacking back was the one the tanks were meleeing.  Assumption #1 is that<br/>
the lizzies also failed their second resist that GZ said they get.  Now the<br/>
other bard&#39;s lullaby kicks in.  This time, Assumption #2 is that some of the<br/>
mobs resist either the first check or the second check.  What happens now?<br/>
Do the mobs that resist the second bard&#39;s lullaby wake up or does the<br/>
lullaby from my song still stay in effect.  I was the higher level bard and<br/>
from my experience when two bards sing the same song the higher level bards<br/>
overrides the lower level one.  Since the other bard took serious damage<br/>
during the fight, I am inclined to believe that the mobs woke up when they<br/>
resisted his lullaby and attacked him because he was lower level than me.  I<br/>
then usually put them back to sleep when my song pulsed again.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have an idea on how this could safely get tested?  I think a 50<br/>
cleric on standby to heal and res would be necessary.  <br/>

&gt; I would try the two bards sing Lullaby somewhere else before getting too <br/>
&gt; excited that is works so well.  I am very sorry to say that the pathing is<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so messed up at the top of that temple that if you stay out of melee range<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of the lizzies (and off the steps, any steps) you can effectively cheat by<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; using ranged attack.  Since the lizzies get &quot;stuck&quot; in place, by being out<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of their melee range just sit back and use casters or whatever to kill em.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very very poor sport.  I don&#39;t do this.  I have seen a bard climb the<br/>
&gt; roof, <br/>
&gt; lev off, and run around aggro&#39;ing all the lizzies around the temple then <br/>
&gt; stand on steps at top of temple.  The lizzies come to him, ignoring all <br/>
&gt; others.  He climbs roof, then rest of group slays lizzies which do not<br/>
&gt; even <br/>
&gt; fight back.  I have seen it and thought it a shame.  I even grouped in a <br/>
&gt; group that did this, before I realized what was really happening.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; is just the Cazic-Thule server that this phenom happens, but i would <br/>
&gt; recommend trying Lullaby somewhere else with two bards to be sure it is<br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; the poor pathing in the temple.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Slowly but surely, we killed off the intial 10 mobs.  However, this took<br/>
&gt; us <br/>
&gt; &gt;so<br/>
&gt; &gt;long that as we got down to the last few mobs, new ones spawned along the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;steps.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I just kept singing Lullaby the entire fight.  Eventually we killed off<br/>
&gt; all <br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;mobs.  All told, I think we were fighting lizards continuously for over<br/>
&gt; 15<br/>
&gt; &gt;minutes.   We all stood around in disbelief at what we had just <br/>
&gt; &gt;accomplished.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Final tally was Us:15 Lizards:0.  Everyone started hooting and hollering <br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;patting each other on the back.  Everyone was out of mana but no one was <br/>
&gt; &gt;below<br/>
&gt; &gt;60% health.  Everyone agreed that the reason for our success were me and <br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;other bard keeping all the mobs out of the fight.  To say the least I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;ecstatic.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In hindsight, I wished I would have turned on the log file function prior<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;fight so I could have collected some test data for the ongoing Lullaby <br/>
&gt; &gt;issue.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Like so many of us, I was convinced the song was broken.  It may be that <br/>
&gt; &gt;two<br/>
&gt; &gt;bards singing Lullaby (one continuously and the other weaving it in) <br/>
&gt; &gt;negated the<br/>
&gt; &gt;problem of mobs still attacking after the initial resist.  Even if a mob<br/>
&gt; &gt;resisted my song the first time, he still had to resist the other bards <br/>
&gt; &gt;song.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think it also helped that my charisma was 149 and the other bards was<br/>
&gt; 145<br/>
&gt; &gt;(with sympathetic aura buff).  All I can say is that last night was the <br/>
&gt; &gt;most fun<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve had playing EQ in a long time and that I&#39;m further convinced that a <br/>
&gt; &gt;bard<br/>
&gt; &gt;and enchanter in the same group make a lethal combination.<br/>
