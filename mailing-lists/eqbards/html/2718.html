&gt;In short, if I were starting a new bard knowing what I know<br/>
&gt;now, I&#39;d probably distribute my points equally between str,<br/>

&gt;bard full-time, and just thought it would be a good class with<br/>
&gt;which to get a feel for the game.  So I put all my points into<br/>
&gt;chr to test its effect on prices.  Little did I know I&#39;d end<br/>
&gt;up hooked on playing a bard...  :-)<br/>

My bard was supposed to be a test drive, thought<br/>
I was going to go a few levels and start my &quot;real&quot;<br/>
character.<br/>
 <br/>
Every time I try to start a new char, I keep coming<br/>
back to my bard.  Fortuanately I distributed my<br/>
points fairly evenly between str (85) agi (95) dex (95)<br/>
and cha (95)<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about it, the more I think I got it <br/>
pretty close to right the first time<br/>
