of Diety.<br/>

Letter to Verant - Expansion Pack Addition<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don&#39;t expect this to take effect until the expansion pack, but I&#39;m<br/>
reasonably certain it will be in the game then, but here is the e-mail I<br/>
just sent to Brad, and I know he will think it is a wonderful idea, so it<br/>
will get attention.<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
Brad,<br/>
My fellow monks and I are tired of either worshiping Quellious or being<br/>
Agnostic. Some of us think monks should believe in a diety, but a lot of us<br/>
feel, I know I do, that Quellious is just too weak. The tranquil? We want a<br/>
god who is willing to put it on the line for us, to come down and smite the<br/>
infidel when we are cornered. We want a god who&#39;se not afraid of anyone. We<br/>
want a god who kicks ass. Therefore, I am proposing to you a new god.<br/>
<br/>
Armadillas. God of Meat. And for Armadillas there should be a new order of<br/>
monks, &#39;Armmadillo Secret Service&#39; (ASS). Anyone who is in the ASS should<br/>
have special privilages. Obviously, once you are in the ASS, you are there<br/>
for good. But it should be quit e a task to get in the ASS to begin with.<br/>
One should have to prove themselves worthy to be in the ASS. Perhaps a<br/>
quest for an item to get them in the ASS.<br/>
<br/>
Special ASS abilities:<br/>
<br/>
An ASS should be able to call forth the power of the Armadillo, &#39;Fist of<br/>
the Almighty Rank Terror&#39; (FART). Obviously, an ASS releasing a FART would<br/>
be devistating to the opponent, and we think it would be fair to do around<br/>
300 points of damage, with a 60 second stun.<br/>
<br/>
An ASS should be able to Feign Death earlier than those of the other<br/>
orders, and the Feign Death should never fail and be invoked automatically<br/>
if the ASS is about to die. The &#39;Wait In Pain Exquisite&#39; (WIPE) technique<br/>
would be used when an ASS is feigning . The ASS WIPE technique would<br/>
increase a Feigning ASS&#39;s healing rate to 50hp/tick. The ASS WIPE would<br/>
require one bandage to pull off... or two bandages if it was a LOT of<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
Every ASS should be able to call forth a pet Armadillo. The reasons are<br/>
obvious. The ASS&#39;s pet should have all of the innate abilities of an ASS,<br/>
even though the pet is never actually in the ASS (that would be too much<br/>
obviously). An ASS pet should be all owed to zone with the ASS as well. The<br/>
pet summoned should always be 2 levels higher than the ASS caller, but<br/>
should never take any of the experience. ASS pets should heal at a rate of<br/>
75hp/tick, dual wield, cast, and feign death at 1hp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All in all I think adding the ability for a Monk to be an ASS would add<br/>
greatly to the play value of EverQuest. I have carefully considered these<br/>
abilities and I think that you&#39;ll find it is balanced with the rest of the<br/>
classes. Not everyone will want to be an ASS. An ASS would require a<br/>
special player, for to be in the ASS is a great honor.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to being an ASS after the expansion pack is released. My<br/>
brother and sister ASS&#39;s will bring much enjoyment to EverQuest for all of<br/>
the players.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You.</div>
