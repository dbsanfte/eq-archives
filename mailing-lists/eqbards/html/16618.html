Lady Vox was slain in her lair by The Pantheon on the Innoruuk server.<br/>
<br/>
We got 2 Mc Vaxius horns (me and Kaldivar), a Staff of Forbidden Rights, and<br/>
a Warhammer of Divine Grace.  She also dropped a Book used in the Fiery<br/>
Avenger quest which we gave to Avarus of the Legions of Darkness (a rival<br/>
quild).  He should be the first on our server to complete the quest and<br/>
obtain the coveted weapon.<br/>
<br/>
The fight seemed much longer than our battle with Nagafen but I have not<br/>
checked my log yet to see the actual time.  I was again in the 2nd wave.<br/>
This time there were *alot* of casualties and until the very end I was<br/>
uncertain of the outcome.  She has that ridiculous complete heal but I did<br/>
not see her use it - maybe she did early on and went OOM.  I managed to live<br/>
through the battle - perhaps because I did not melee until the very end.<br/>
Elemental & Guardian with MM Batle drum.  No one in our party ran from the<br/>
fear and we were directly underneath her.  And, oh yeah, there are a couple<br/>
surprizes waiting for you.  Far be it from me to spoil your fun but when you<br/>
get there I think you will notice a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Logging in was almost harder than killing the dragon.  For some reason, the<br/>
patch server would error out downloading the updates over my ISDN<br/>
connection.  In despairation, I connected my 2nd PC with a crap 28.8 analog<br/>
to my backup ISP and was able to get the updates. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
