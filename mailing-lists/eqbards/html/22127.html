We are looking into a few bardic changes. Nothing is set in stone yet on <br/>
this, it still has to be reviewed, but I thought I´┐¢d let you know what we´┐¢re <br/>
thinking about. We are thinking about reducing secondary resists for <br/>
targeted mesmerize songs (with the possibility of a new song along these <br/>
lines). There are some other potential changes that we are considering, but <br/>
I´┐¢ll have to tell you about them after we have a chance to talk them over <br/>
further.<br/>
