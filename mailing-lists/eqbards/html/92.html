I am new to the Bard Guild and have not heard of any<br/>
such group to join, I am a Wood Elf Bard and already<br/>
have 3 of my five songs, would I be compensated for<br/>
those if I decided to join (other songs or resource).<br/>
Where are you located and are there other Guilds out<br/>
there to join for Bards?<br/>

&gt; I appreciate your concern, and I know that ten<br/>
&gt; platinum is a hefty sum.<br/>
&gt; But, as I responded to you privately, the funds are<br/>
&gt; not misused nor are<br/>
&gt; they squandered. Running a guild has its expenses,<br/>
&gt; especially if we are to<br/>
&gt; provide collective services for our bards so that<br/>
&gt; they might carry on their<br/>
&gt; work with honor and dignity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I mentioned to you before, lad, we provide the<br/>
&gt; following services to our<br/>
&gt; members:<br/>
&gt;     * Patchwork armor for all new students<br/>
&gt;     * The first five levels of songs for all new<br/>
&gt; students<br/>
&gt;     * A hand drum at level 5<br/>
&gt;     * A lute at level 8<br/>
&gt;     * Bi-weekly rewards for the best in-guild ballad<br/>
&gt; or writing. This week<br/>
&gt;        it was a Banded mail tunic.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt; Also, we use the money to pay for other expenses,<br/>
&gt; including:<br/>
&gt;      * Staff for concerts<br/>
&gt;      * Saving for a guild hall<br/>
&gt;      * Prizes for other Soerbaird events<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We do not use guild money for:<br/>
&gt;      * Buying better armor or equipment for guild<br/>
&gt; leadership<br/>
&gt;      * Bribing news sites for better placement<br/>
&gt;      * Paying necromancers to destory anyone who<br/>
&gt; speaks negatively<br/>
&gt;        about The Soerbaird<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the public record, all of our staff, called<br/>
&gt; Ollave, have more than paid<br/>
&gt; their ten platinum, without a complaint, and most of<br/>
&gt; them continue to<br/>
&gt; contribute into the guild treasury on a daily basis,<br/>
&gt; in order to benefit<br/>
&gt; our students. I have seen several of them give the<br/>
&gt; shirts off of their<br/>
&gt; backs and the weapons from their fists to help a<br/>
&gt; deserved student in need.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Doerbaird, before you sally our guild&#39;s reputation<br/>
&gt; again in a public forum,<br/>
&gt; I would respectfully request that you air your<br/>
&gt; differences with me, as I<br/>
&gt; will be happy to hear any problem you have with our<br/>
&gt; guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Listen and Live.<br/>
