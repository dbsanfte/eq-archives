&lt;&lt; How is this for a compromise.  When you respawn you have the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; current rez effect, plus you only have 10% of your max HPs.<br/>
 &gt; Then change the binding rules to allow casters to bind anyone,<br/>
 &gt; anywhere (with a yes/no box).  I feel this would balance the<br/>
 &gt; risk/reward factor, and make it so people could not <br/>
 &gt; use suicide binding tactics when fighting Dragons and such.<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this , more than any other proposition i&#39;ve seen. Truth be told <br/>
, i&#39;d love it if casters could only bind in city&#39;s , but i doubt that will <br/>
happen. I&#39;m level 40 now and i can get res&#39;s regularly , i still would like <br/>
the ability to be bound anywhere. Dying for me is -fun , and i think exp loss <br/>
is penalty enough - 4x in a row in 40 really hurts. Running back when i can&#39;t <br/>
get res&#39;d is just salt in the wound <br/>
