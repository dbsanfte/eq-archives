<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363763704"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I too wonder about folks that break their neck to hit 50. It&#39;s pretty<br/>
&gt; predictible once you hit 50 in this world you are &#39;done&#39; - why are folks so<br/>
&gt; very determined to &#39;finish&#39; then get upset there is nothin new?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The world doesn&#39;t end at 50.  That&#39;s for sure.  If you are playing<br/>
  this game with your end result being that L50 is when you are done<br/>
  and it&#39;s time to give up, then you are missing the better half of<br/>
  the entire thing.  Verant has restricted 3 zones with level limits<br/>
  of 46, even if you go in there at 50, you are nothing on your own.<br/>
<br/>
  The strongest L50 player cannot solo one single mob in any of the <br/>
  planes.  There is plenty to once you make L50, there&#39;s no end in<br/>
  sight for me.  It&#39;s just too damn crowded, and when it&#39;s not too<br/>
  crowded there&#39;s a reason, it&#39;s too damn hard.  It&#39;s not like I <br/>
  can pickup 4 or 5 people and hit the planes, we&#39;d be massacred.<br/>
  There&#39;s really no where to go with other L50 people on a regular<br/>
  basis to get exp and have fun that doesn&#39;t take a week to organize.<br/>
<br/>
  If you aren&#39;t near level 50, I wouldn&#39;t expect to have any plane<br/>
  action or any of the vastly superior equipment this game has to<br/>
  offer.  I like finding and earning new things in the Planes, it&#39;s<br/>
  like a cracker jack box with a random prize.  I&#39;m not just happy<br/>
  for myself, I&#39;m happy for others when they earn something or do<br/>
  something extraordinary.  That&#39;s what it is to be L50.<br/>
<br/>
  If I wanna chat or roleplay and enjoy the friends I have I usually<br/>
  sign on my other toon for adventures and action.  There&#39;s nothing<br/>
  really left for a L50 on the weekdays.  Helping people gets really<br/>
  boring after a while, as does camping anything, so I end up running<br/>
  around doing errands.<br/>
<br/>
  At L50 (not max exp bar, since the new patch) you can:<br/>
 <br/>
  * earn back a full bar of exp, as there are usually some uncamped<br/>
    places on the server for exp.  solb/sola bug zoneline and stone<br/>
    room or kludge keep (heh) for example.<br/>
 <br/>
  * twink your buds.<br/>
<br/>
  * camp for items that you maybe need or dont need.<br/>
<br/>
  * go on guild events that usually end up in you dying for nothing.<br/>
    (ie the efreeti)<br/>
<br/>
  * sit around and chat it up or help lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
  * practice skills, crafts.<br/>
<br/>
  * try to organize a plane trip on a weekday.<br/>
<br/>
  ... the list goes on...<br/>
<br/>
  There is plenty to do, it&#39;s just once you&#39;ve done all that you want<br/>
  a change of pace.  Verant is not offering an easy change of pace.<br/>
  L50 has its perks, and it&#39;s definitely not the end of the game, but<br/>
  they need to stop concentrating on low/mid level zones and start <br/>
  thinking about all these people who are now L35+ and crowding the<br/>
  server.  Eventually, the server will become top heavy.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m sorry if you L1 - L35 people are offended by all this talk.<br/>
  I had a great time up to L35, there was nothing wrong with the<br/>
  game then, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with it now.  Permafrost<br/>
  is *still* empty each night, so is Sola.  Unrest is no more crowded<br/>
  than it was when I was little, same with highkeep.  The game is<br/>
  fine for lower level people.  It&#39;s not fine for higher level people.<br/>
  We need about 3-4 more zones just for higher level people.<br/>
<br/>
  A big problem I noticed that is L25-L30 people popping into lguk<br/>
  and solb, and hogging space that a higher level person should<br/>
  be utilizing.  Those people below L35 have plenty of outlets <br/>
  for experience, instead the come to solb/lguk because that&#39;s<br/>
  where everyone is.  To those people, I wish they would go to<br/>
  Paw or hunt in Rathe Mountains.  <br/>
<br/>
  The new zones I suggested should be level capped at L40+ to enter,<br/>
  anyone lower than that is simply not allowed in.  It&#39;s not fair,<br/>
  I know -- but that&#39;s too bad, 80% of the rest of the world has<br/>
  easy exp for you.<br/>
<br/>
  Most people don&#39;t realize I don&#39;t get exp from 90% of the kobolds<br/>
  in solb, and I&#39;d say 75% of the frogs in lguk no longer give exp.<br/>
  But there is a group of L39s barely, and I mean barely holding the<br/>
  bat room in solb, who simply refuse to let L50s in because they <br/>
  are too high, and will &#39;steal&#39; too much exp.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant needs to start looking into the future.  The expansion<br/>
  will offer no great significance to me, I am thinking.  4 or 5<br/>
  more newbie zones offer me nothing.  4 or 5 midlevel zones <br/>
  offer me nothing.  And then maybe another solb/lguk spinoff in<br/>
  the expansion will not suffice the populace as it is growing.<br/>
  What happens when the cap is raised?  Where will we fight for<br/>
  exp then?  The bugs/bats in solb are L37-L42, nox is L45.  Heh,<br/>
  that will last us until what... L56???  bah...<br/>
<br/>
  People all the time tell me to play another class, start over,<br/>
  do different things.  It never once crossed their mind that <br/>
  I _like_ my bard.  I like to play him, I cannot stand other<br/>
  class&#39; playability.  I don&#39;t want to play the new lizard race,<br/>
  I tell people, read my lips: &quot;i  l i k e  m y  b a r d&quot; ;)<br/>
  Ahh, but people still don&#39;t get it.  Working up to L50 was a <br/>
  challenge, and now I want greater challenges than mobs that <br/>
  can hit for 1000+ dmg a round... gimme a break.  I wish Verant<br/>
  would stop upping the numbers, and start making different, more<br/>
  complex zones for us people who have worked our way to the top.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant told us in beta that it would take about a year to make<br/>
  L50.....  In less than two months, technically, their year is up.  <br/>
  I want to see some results, they owe us results.<br/>
