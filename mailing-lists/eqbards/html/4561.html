<div id="ygrps-yiv-849997974">Not a bad suggestion, but I prefer Crushes Tunic.  Yes, its 3.5 lbs, but its<br/>
still ac12 and the +8 to resistances has saved my bacon more times than I<br/>
can tell.  With the tunic, my snakeskin mask, and my Dragoon Dirk I have had<br/>
great success soloing yellow casters.  I resist about 85-90% of their spells<br/>
with Purifying Rhythyms twisted into my mix.  Its amazing the difference<br/>
good MR and a fast weapon make when fighting casters.  I feared green<br/>
casters when I had a mino axe.  Now I just laugh when someone says, who can<br/>
get that caster?<br/>

Heres what you do at your level. Dump the Banded tunic and get a Lockjaw<br/>
hide one. Its AC 12 and plus 5 stamina. Thats only a 2 point loss in AC and<br/>
it weighs, get this, 1.5 pounds. I have Steel all the way around right now<br/>
except the tunic and weigh 65 lbs without anything in my inventory, and<br/>
72lbs with my normal packs and accoutrements. My dex is 120 agil 108 Str 85.<br/>
I wear Dex and Agil jewelry a blackened iron crown gives me plus 5 str along<br/>
with plus 5 to all the protections. But you definitley want to invest in a<br/>
LJ tunic, for 40-60pp you cant go wrong. I figure I will trade mine in soon<br/>
on Rubicite or Mithril, but at that point I have to worry about my Str<br/>
again.<br/>

You know what&#39;s really sad?  I wrestle with the decision to restart<br/>
my currently &quot;of the 11th Chorus.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t pump my strength all the way, I had decided when creating my<br/>
character to &quot;play the bard&quot; -- which meant being a great singer /<br/>
instrumentalist  and  being an extremely charismatic person.  So I<br/>
have 100 Dexterity and 100 Charisma.  My strength is only 80.  (I do<br/>
have the basic +2 ring from a jeweler friend, and a purity belt, but<br/>
I would really like to get some earmufflers!)<br/>
<br/>
The first time I donned my banded tunic, I was awed by how good I<br/>
look in it.  Admit it, how many characters get that golden armor look<br/>
without resorting to bronze?  And then when you complete the outfit<br/>
(I actually hate the headpiece, so I never bought it), you get that<br/>
golden/blue-boy look.<br/>
<br/>
But the damn thing was so heavy that you have to watch what you loot.<br/>
 And I was training my tailoring at the time.  Not to mention the<br/>
inordinate amount of time it takes to loot your own corpse.<br/>
<br/>
So, off goes the armor, into two backpacks in the bank, and I started<br/>
my poaching-in-the-nude era.  That&#39;s also when I saw my Defense skill<br/>
finally catch up with my level.  That&#39;s also when I first met Ness<br/>
(who probably conned me red, inspected my inventory and found out I<br/>
wasn&#39;t wearing anything ...)<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyway, back to the present.  I&#39;m level 11 now, and the only<br/>
monsters I can get exp from are those that do incredible amounts of<br/>
damage and have bash skills to boot.  I come out at half life with<br/>
blues, and blacks can kill me if I don&#39;t kite them around the block a<br/>
few times while I heal up.<br/>
<br/>
One time after getting easily killed by a darkweed, I decided to take<br/>
the banded out of cold storage.  Lo and behold.  Darkweed, easy solo.<br/>
 Young Kodiak, can&#39;t even hit me enough times before it starts<br/>
running away.  I was a happy poacher with two HQ bear pelts, and four<br/>
HQ cat pelts.  Granted, I was encumbered at 100 lbs, but when I&#39;m<br/>
fighting, my two songs give just enough strength not to suffer any<br/>
encumberance penalties.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it would be nice to have 100 strength in the first place, just<br/>
so I can walk to the inn instead of crawling.<br/>
<br/>
Pheh.  Hopefully I&#39;ll find some more strength boosting items soon.  I<br/>
just need to make money now.....<br/>
<br/>
Quit on Stormtower?  NEVER!  Well ... not a second time ...<br/>
<br/>
(My original character was Sturmtower, who reached level 4 before I<br/>
decided that agility doesn&#39;t do as much as dexterity.  I didn&#39;t twink<br/>
-- there was nothing to twink at that level anyway.  But ol&#39;<br/>
Stormtower _is_ not really the original.)<br/>

and subsequently cash poor<br/>
