characters at that level there.  Just north of the caves by the giant <br/>
gears, there are several skeletons.  I&#39;ve often played ring around <br/>
the skellies there, going from one skeleton to the next, with a mino <br/>
slaver pull in between (during levels 12-13).  It&#39;s a constant stream <br/>
of exp.  The loot from the skeletons isn&#39;t bad either.  Almost always <br/>
some silver, occasionally gold, chips, and more rarely cloth or <br/>
leather items.  When you rest, climb high into the hills so a <br/>
wandering lord or hero doesn&#39;t find you.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun place is the Nybright sisters camp in Lesser Faydark, <br/>
near loc -800, +2500 (I think).  If you gather a dull pearl necklace <br/>
from each sister and give it to the drunkard in kelethin, you get <br/>
more exp and some item that sells for around 1pp.  The sisters drop a <br/>
lot of rusties and the occasional bronze weapon.  I would go over <br/>
there whenever I was getting bored in Steamfont.<br/>
