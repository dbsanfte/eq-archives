<div id="ygrps-yiv-484649958">Hehe - I feel for ya!<br/>
<br/>
Last group I left over similar situation.  The leader was doing dumb stuff -<br/>
trying to killsteal, not sharing spawns, arguing with other campers, etc.<br/>
So, finally someone says lets go to this bandit camp... I say no, we are too<br/>
low for them. Leader say no, we can take em. I say, bye bye!<br/>
<br/>
Not five minutes later, I am standing on a path by a hut with no guards<br/>
talking to some adventurers when former leader trains bandit camp on top of<br/>
use &#39;cuz he thinks this hut has guards.  I left the group cuz I dint want<br/>
this idjit to git me keeled but he managed to keel me anyways! &lt;oh well<br/>
living and dieing in Norrath&gt;<br/>

		Alright the mage thinks to themselves, I need a nice safe<br/>
place to meditate.<br/>
		Hm, this bridge here should be safe.  When folks train the<br/>
really tough<br/>
		monsters like that big Proon, they&#39;ll most certainly bring<br/>
him this way.<br/>
		Yes, I&#39;ll sit down right here, because I can be most certain<br/>
this is where<br/>
		Proon will be standing angrily when the fleeing person is<br/>
gone.  And I will<br/>
		have no time to even stand up before I&#39;m dead!  Perfect!  Oh<br/>
that rivershore<br/>
		nearby is far too safe, Proon might not see me, completely<br/>
unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
		I cannot believe the angry shouts from these people, angry<br/>
they were not<br/>
		warned Proon was coming.  Dumb people.<br/>
<br/>
		Today was the first day I actually quit a group and actually<br/>
informed them<br/>
		it was because they were such a bad group.  Usually I am<br/>
more discreet,<br/>
		because the bad players actually try to be good players, and<br/>
may learn one<br/>
		day.  But this group, from their idiotic banter, to their<br/>
actions, arrgh!<br/>
		They got me killed by all four, not just one, the whole<br/>
dullard lot of them<br/>
		chasing after a hurt monster, happily slashing away.<br/>
Meanwhile the bard is<br/>
		left to fend for himself!  Not only that, I was stacking<br/>
Hymn and Anthem...<br/>
		with another bard in the group, playing... of all things,<br/>
Accelerando!<br/>
		During battle!  He told me he was playing it because we<br/>
might have to flee.<br/>
		For the whole battle, he plays it, for when we flee.....<br/>
&lt;&lt;rolls eyes&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
		I think bards may have a bad reputation by the dumb people<br/>
who like just one<br/>
		song, likely the entire basis of their class-choice, and<br/>
play this song even<br/>
		at the innapropriate times!  This fool-bard also mentioned<br/>
he was twinked so<br/>
		heavily because he sold crack.  &quot;Only the gods can help me<br/>
now!&quot; I thought,<br/>
		and they didn&#39;t.<br/>
