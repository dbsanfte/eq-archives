<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577341459"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is it just me, or does anyone else have a problem with a member of our own<br/>
&gt; class engaging in behavior that is so intrusive of others? It&#39;s bad when I<br/>
&gt; do something dumb and endanger myself, or my group - endangering bystanders<br/>
&gt; is just unforgiveable in my book, especially when it&#39;s unnecessary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  You do nothing but complain on this list.  And you don&#39;t even<br/>
  sign your name.  I&#39;m a little concerned that you have some built<br/>
  up anger inside.  (I&#39;ve mentioned it before through the use of<br/>
  your &quot;quotation marks&quot; and CAPITALIZATION.)  Is there something<br/>
  we can do to calm you down?<br/>
