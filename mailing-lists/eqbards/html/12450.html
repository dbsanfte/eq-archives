 </span></blockquote>  What the f*ck?  Were you there?  Hell no you werent.  You have no<br/>
  clue as to what happened.  We didn&#39;t get spanked at all.  I&#39;ll share<br/>
  with you what happened Ms. Naive.<br/>
<br/>
  LoD (ala FoH) does everything, they just dropped Nagafen, and threatened<br/>
  to come take Vox next.  The Vox teams rushed around trying to do it all<br/>
  before LoD showed up and the was the first major problem.  Then some<br/>
  shaman pets got lose after pulling monk FD, and inadvertantly pulled<br/>
  Vox right into the King Room.  People paniced, and ran around, and then<br/>
  chaos ensued.  It really pisses me off that those mistakes were made,<br/>
  but it even pisses me off more that you think we got spanked.  We didn&#39;t<br/>
  even fight Vox.<br/>

  Irritated,<br/>
