Subject: [eqbards] Press Release: NagaThin to distribute in LGuk <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, March 30th<br/>
<br/>
Old Ruins Of Guk- NagaThin Industries began distribution here of their<br/>
Muffins N&#39; Milk product last night. NagaThin products are widely popular<br/>
other parts of Norrath  for it&#39;s high protein and low fat content. &quot;It was<br/>
very successful&quot; said Mr. Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, CEO of NagaThin Industries,<br/>
&quot;People were literally dying to get them&quot;. Pressed further Mr. E&#39;Taurguin<br/>
admitted that one  single person bought 80% of the inventory but that they<br/>
did in fact die trying to get them.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the popularity was the low price. &quot;We wanted to get a feeling for<br/>
the actual needs of the marketplace so we priced them at 1pp for 20 to<br/>
remove any reticence over price.&quot; said Mr. E&#39;Taurguin, &quot;Due mostly to<br/>
transportation costs as well as some risk of loss of life in distribution I<br/>
believe the market price will settle around 3pp for 20 of either the Muffins<br/>
or Milk products.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Platinum was not the only gain from this marketing trial, upon arrival Mr.<br/>
E&#39;Taurguin let it be known that as a one time offer, Shin Gauntlets were<br/>
also acceptable as payment. Within minutes a beaming druid was receiving her<br/>
case of NagaThin Milk, &quot;this is going to be great during downtimes&quot; she<br/>
perked, &quot;and when people see me drinking Naga they are going to be happy to<br/>
offer next in the loot order for a bottle of their own&quot;. Clearly a loyal<br/>
customer, but was it really worth the gauntlets? &quot;duh&quot; she snorted, &quot;water<br/>
is so last week, my friends and I are the NagaThin Generation&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning distribution was not without it&#39;s dangers. Mr. E&#39;Taurguin, a Bard<br/>
by training was not entirely welcomed by the locals &quot;I have had some<br/>
unfriendly dealings with Frogluks in the past, and upon arriving they made<br/>
it clear they were ready and willing to attack me. But  being a Bard I sang<br/>
myself invisible and while short shout messages look unnervingly like the<br/>
&#39;you feel yourself starting to appear&#39; message, everything went fine.&quot;. At<br/>
the end of the event Mr. E&#39;Taurguin stumbled upon the winning solution<br/>
however: &quot;I began to regret my former dealings with the Frogluk people and<br/>
was pondering what I could do to raise their consideration of me. Then it<br/>
hit me, I felt like an idiot I hadn&#39;t thought of it sooner&quot;. Playing upon<br/>
the lack of deep seated hatred towards him by the Frogluks, Mr. E&#39;Taurguin<br/>
quickly called upon the NagaThin&#39;s Music Director Cinda Beemer who Mr.<br/>
E&#39;Taurguin describes as &quot;a great asset to our marketing efforts&quot;. Singing<br/>
Ms. Beemer&#39;s  jingle &quot;Charismatic Carillon&quot; the Frogluks stopped attacking<br/>
Mr. E&#39;Taurguin, and while they still considered him as threatening, they did<br/>
not act upon their feelings &quot;good enough for me&quot; said Mr. E&#39;Taurguin &quot;there<br/>
is just nothing like good marketing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
NagaThin Industries is a privately owned company who is expected by analysts<br/>
to make an Initial Public Offering within the year. After the Old Ruins Of<br/>
Guk success, says Freeport Based Analyst Ton Twostring &quot;This  is a company<br/>
to watch, very hot property, we are all somewhat frustrated they are not<br/>
seeking venture capitol&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[NagaThin Industries wishes to thank well known travel consultant Adam<br/>
Wasserman for his efforts towards this great success]<br/>
