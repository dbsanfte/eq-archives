<div id="ygrps-yiv-391034937">Here is what I found - we were camping Herman the Hermit for the Winds of<br/>
Karana quest.  He was a dangerous blue to me - so there was no way I could<br/>
solo him and in fact he did kill me even when I had help. He&#39;s a ranger or<br/>
druid - I don&#39;t know those classes well enough to say exactly but he would<br/>
spawn and then buff himself with at least 3 buffs in a row - the 3rd one<br/>
being shield of thorns - ouch!<br/>
<br/>
So when my blonde-ness wore off, I thought hmmm, what if I don&#39;t wait for<br/>
him to get all nice and thorny before schwacking him?  So, we&#39;d heal up then<br/>
while my party - 2 rangers were medding I went over by his bedroom window to<br/>
practice my brass skills - ya, ya I was just practicing - that&#39;s it!  <br/>
<br/>
Sylly begins to practice her brass...<br/>
a hermit begins to cast a spell...(some kinda self-buff)<br/>
a hermit begins to cast a spell...(another self-buff)<br/>
a hermit winces...(hehe here is where he winces instead of casting thorns)<br/>
a hermit begins to cast a spell...(now he&#39;s mad but has forgotten to do the<br/>
rest of his buffs)<br/>
Sylly is struck by a bolt of fire...(ok, doky time to come out and play<br/>
herman!)<br/>
<br/>
So - while this was not exactly interrupting his casting - in that I would<br/>
see only occasional interrupt messages by him - it did significantly affect<br/>
how he would fight us.  As soon as he spawned he gets his first spell off<br/>
immediately then when he got attacked by my Denon&#39;s - he stopped his buff<br/>
routine and switched to his attack mode.<br/>
<br/>
So the tip is - don&#39;t wait for him to spawn (which you know because you see<br/>
his buff casting) before you attack him - lay down a nice AE for him to<br/>
spawn into.  Unless you like stabbing yourself with thorns &lt;g&gt;<br/>

p.s.  Harmonic Distortion gave a concert in BlackBurrow Paw Sunday<br/>
afternoon.  It proved to be very popular because _every_single_gnoll_ in the<br/>
whole Burrow (and some of the married ones too!) came up to the top floor<br/>
and gathered around Harmonic to hear his concert.  When he was done, a<br/>
certain druid named Estella who was also enjoying the concert, applauded the<br/>
performance with what sounded like the shock of an earthquake! The young<br/>
adventurers in the Burrow were quite happy to loot the 30 or so gnolls who<br/>
died in that blast &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

		Here&#39;s my take on the whole issue.<br/>
		I&#39;m not sure of this but this is just a couple of<br/>
		observations I have made using lullaby extensively.<br/>
		(Been using it a lot since I got it at level 15)<br/>
		Every song pulses at every tick (6 seconds) as far as<br/>
		I can tell. And lullaby/nod is no exception. I think<br/>
		every time nod pulses the mob has to make a savings <br/>
		check to see if it resists or not. Assume we have a<br/>
		spell caster that resisted it, and then it begins <br/>
		casting. If the casting does not take more than 6 <br/>
		seconds, there is no chance that nod will be able to <br/>
		interupt it. Since NPC casters do not suffer the same<br/>
		casting time limitations as PC casters do, most are <br/>
		able to get a spell off before the next pulse of nod <br/>
		and hence can cast without being interupted. However,<br/>
		sometimes when the mob resist nod, it attacks first and<br/>
		then cast. When this happens, the attack and the casting<br/>
		might not be complete within 6 seconds so when nod pulses <br/>
		again and the mob fails the savings, then it is nodded<br/>
		and it&#39;s casting is interupted. This is what I seem to<br/>
		observe a lot. YMMV.<br/>
