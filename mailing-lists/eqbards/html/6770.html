<div id="ygrps-yiv-450801213">Guess that pretty much settles the case for me.  The next time I log on, I&#39;m<br/>
gonna submit a bug report.  <br/>
<br/>
Bug report wording:<br/>
<br/>
I am 23d level bard with maxed out singing and string skills.  I was<br/>
fighting evil eyes in Beholder when I got hit with the Shallow Breath spell.<br/>
I started singing the 22d level bard song which is supposed to remove<br/>
negative spell effects.  I got the &quot;static pulse&quot; message which indicates<br/>
the song is active.  The Shallow Breath DOT was not removed.  If the song<br/>
worked properly the Shallow Breath DOT should have been removed.  Several<br/>
bards on the EQBard Onelist have reported the same experience with this<br/>
song.  <br/>
<br/>
Does that cover just about everything needed in a bug report?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; Has anyone tried playing the 22d level song while under the influence of<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; negative spell, with a lute equipped, and themselves targetted (by<br/>
&gt; hitting<br/>
&gt; &gt; the F1 key or left-clicking on their name).  The times I have tried to<br/>
&gt; use<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes.  I&#39;ve tried targeting myself, targeting a party member,<br/>
&gt; targeting the mob who cast the spell, having it playing when<br/>
&gt; the effect is cast, with both positive and negative spell<br/>
&gt; effects.  Nothing.  Given that the level 40 song was broken<br/>
&gt; until we complained about it, I do believe that there&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; slight chance that it&#39;s within the realm of possibility that<br/>
&gt; the level 22 song is also broken.<br/>
