<br/>
1. Boy do I hate the new animations!!! &quot;Grrr Bark Bark Grrr.  It&#39;s Verant&#39;s<br/>
like you that are an insult to all of Norrath!!!&quot;  One big reason I started<br/>
a bard was because of how great the &quot;surfing&quot; bard looked!  I thought that<br/>
was the way it was designed and not merely something they &quot;left out.&quot;  And I<br/>
feel that by now, like it or not, it became part of the bard &quot;persona&quot; and<br/>
they should put it back!  Ya, ya, I will endlessly /feedback this one.<br/>
<br/>
2. Looks like bards are gonna be in demand more and more.  Why?  MR/CR/HR<br/>
for dragons of course and now mana-bards in the planes.  Ya, ya, I been<br/>
grinding away on xp and close to 43 now (and the last good song for a while)<br/>
Ogg bouncers, King room Lower G, Lord room Lower G. (Yes, it&#39;s nice to be in<br/>
a guild that can break these rooms at will. And we have a cleric and<br/>
enchanter that can break both King and Lord rooms - just the two of them!<br/>
Once broken, unless it&#39;s prime time and the zone is over camped getting<br/>
there is harder than the break-in.)<br/>
<br/>
3.  I solo&#39;d an HG Saturday.  He was full hp just walking around West Karana<br/>
and conned blue and I was bored so... I targeted him and hit him with chant.<br/>
I kited him around with chant until I got kinda bored - he was down maybe<br/>
20% (ya, i get bored easily) So then I let him close and I started screetch!<br/>
I got lucky and it stuck the first roll. Chains and double Yak-Attack. Fear<br/>
again as soon as chain stuck. Chain again. Fear again.  Once I switched to<br/>
fear-chain I did not want to miss a beat with fear and wanted to stay ahead<br/>
of him in the hp count so I did not use chant again until he was lower hp<br/>
and less agressive. (I guess this says that my connect or whatever does not<br/>
reliably support playing 3 songs at the same time.  I feel good with 2 but 3<br/>
gets me in trouble sometimes. So, I stuck with 2 and kept him on the run.)<br/>
Long fight and when he finally dropped I was down to one bub hp and really<br/>
hoping the ghoul messanger boy and or were-wolf puppy were far away.  Kinda<br/>
fun ego thing.  Prolly wont be making a career of it.  But with a co-level<br/>
tank and/or healer it could be quite profitable in Rathe Mts.<br/>
<br/>
4. Sunday solo&#39;d a Griffon.  Well, tried to.  Started with fear & chains.<br/>
Shoulda chant kited.  When he was ahead of me (had more hp) and I was down<br/>
to 2 bubs, I started Selo&#39;s and waddled away.  Should have gotten the head<br/>
start with chant kiting and/or took some unlucky damage rolls.<br/>
