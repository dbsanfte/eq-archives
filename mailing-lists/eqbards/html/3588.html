I don&#39;t adventure outside areas I know VERY well, for this specific reason.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Uhhh, why?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;What possible reason is there to make something even more frustrating than<br/>
&gt;&gt;it already is?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s the point, as it is now, it&#39;s only frustrating to the non-casters.<br/>
&gt;But on the other hand, allowing everyone free reign in binding is a bit<br/>
&gt;extreme (Death still needs to have some penalties involved with it, and as<br/>
&gt;it is now they&#39;re pretty light).  As a medium I suggested making use of the<br/>
&gt;inns & taverns and allowing everyone to bind there.  It gives a use to a<br/>
&gt;pretty much unused entity in the world, and it still stays in fiction.<br/>
