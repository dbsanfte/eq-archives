<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181235966">What&#39;s nice, and I know this comes late, is when you get Berzerker.  It<br/>
provides a speed increase a tad better than  Anthem at that level, STR<br/>
bonus, and a very nice AC bonus (9 points when you first get it).  All in<br/>
one song.  If you&#39;re willing to give up your weapons, and use a horn while<br/>
singing it, it increases speed, strength, and AC quite a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you&#39;ll find use for Chant of Battle again.  It stacks with Celerity.<br/>
Celerity is similar to Anthem, it boosts attack speed, but instead of STR<br/>
bonus, it&#39;s AGI bonus. You can cycle that with Chant of Battle, you get<br/>
attack speed increase, STR, DEX, AGI, and AC bonus, for the whole party.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I just experimented with this last night, after twisting them<br/>
&gt;&gt; together for the past couple of weeks.  I used a combine long sword<br/>
&gt;&gt; (28 delay) and swung 20 times (after the very first swing which<br/>
&gt;&gt; counted as 0) and ran each test twice.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; - With no songs going, 20 swings took 56 seconds, which confirms what<br/>
&gt;&gt; someone said earlier about the delay representing tenths of seconds<br/>
&gt;&gt; of delay.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; - With Anthem as my only song, 20 swings took 51 seconds, or<br/>
&gt;&gt; aproximately a 10% decrease in delay.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; - With just Whistling Warsong going, 20 swings took 48 seconds, or<br/>
&gt;&gt; aproximately a 15% decrease in delay.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; - With both Anthem and Warsong going, 20 swings still took 48<br/>
&gt;&gt; seconds, indicating they do not stack in terms of cutting down on<br/>
&gt;&gt; your delay any further.  You do still get a STR boost from each song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This matches my findings.  I also used a combine longsword.<br/>
&gt;The fellow who used punches (slower) got slightly different<br/>
&gt;results (bigger speedup).  I&#39;m going to test it again with my<br/>
&gt;combine rapier (faster).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Based on this, I&#39;m now no longer going to bother stacking both songs,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and when solo I&#39;ll likely twist Warsong with Bellow and Healing.  In<br/>
&gt;&gt; groups I&#39;ll do Anthem instead of Warsong.  I am going to test this<br/>
&gt;&gt; one more time on a weapon with a greater delay just to be 100% sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Warsong also gives you a pretty good bonus to AC, which can be<br/>
&gt;useful even in a group (since most mobs end up attacking the<br/>
&gt;bard).<br/>
