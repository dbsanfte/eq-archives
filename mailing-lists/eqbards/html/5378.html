<div id="ygrps-yiv-136955308">I can pick up 50pp just in an hour or 2 in Lake Rathe, killing High Gnoll<br/>
Shamans and Embalmers. At night kill Dry Bones for small bronze plate and FS<br/>
weapons. I am palking about at your level too, this is stuff I did at 24-28.<br/>
There are ghouls in NK halfway between the stone and wood bridges that<br/>
consistently drop Bronze weapons, usually good for another 15-20pp. Bandits<br/>
on the river in SK drop the same. If your over 30th, Spectres in Feerot drop<br/>
Scythes worth from 4pp for Bronze to 13pp for regular, Opals, Bpearls, Boxes<br/>
of Abu Kar. These are just a couple of easy money makers. The thing is<br/>
making money is like working for a living, you have to approach it like a<br/>
job and make the effort if thats what you really want. After level 30 the<br/>
cash just happens with the mobs dropping 1-3pp each and FS weapons to sell.<br/>
You can always find a mob that drops a good item and farm it though.<br/>

I think a lot of you people gushing about how easy it is to make money via<br/>
loot are exaggerating.  I have a 23rd monk that works his butt off and he&#39;s<br/>
never had more than about 125pp in the bank at any one time.  I&#39;ve spent<br/>
time<br/>
in unrest.  Where&#39;s the money there?  FS weapons?  The cash drops aren&#39;t<br/>
*that* great.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired of reading<br/>
about<br/>
how others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>

&gt; Aye, its all relative. Plats are very easy to get even after level 20. I<br/>
&gt; have never had less than 100 in the bank since then and almost always over<br/>
&gt; 1000. Today I am buying Blk Pearl Plat earrings and will have up to 1000<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; blow on failures and if they all fail the only thing thats a pain is<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; 4 more BPs to play with. Replacing the 1000 is really easy. This is why I<br/>
&gt; love the bazaars, I trade basically useless Plats for awesome items I or<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; friends can actually use, what a great concept.<br/>
