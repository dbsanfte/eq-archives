&gt; &gt; So after I hit Eurdin for my songs it was off for<br/>
&gt; the Lambents.  I realised<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I got to the temple it said 550gp.  I had<br/>
&gt; everything in PP *DOH*  So<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to the bank I went and back again.  Finally<br/>
&gt; at about 10:45 last night I<br/>
&gt; &gt; ended up with my first piece of lambents!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s my understanding that she lies, and pp is fine.<br/>
&gt;  Of course, I was too chicken to risk it, and did<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; same thing you did.<br/>

My first one I did the same thing only to learn from a<br/>
bard who had already done the quest that you can give<br/>
her Plat instead of gold. She sure sounds specific<br/>
doesn&#39;t she? Well, for my second one, I gave her plat<br/>
instead of gold and got my second bracer. So she does<br/>
accept plat instead of gold.<br/>
