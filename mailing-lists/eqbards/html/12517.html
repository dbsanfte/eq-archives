<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990902940">Well I got into a group in High Hold Keep and later Solusek A and used a<br/>
pair of fine steel war hammer&#39;s.  Pretty low delay and ok damage.  I started<br/>
on a Friday with about 20 points in it at level 28 or so and by Sunday I had<br/>
gotten to level 30 and maxed out 1h blunt.  If you can get in a group like I<br/>
did, that didn&#39;t necessarily need you hacking on anything, it can go up<br/>
pretty fast.  Though I did put my slashing weapons in when we had a big pull<br/>
or seemed to be in trouble.  Everyone in the group was fine with me doing<br/>
this, as long as I kept buffing and healing and all that great bard stuff.<br/>

  I really like this little guide of &quot;weapons to level&quot;. It&#39;s nice to have<br/>
  some type of goal as far what would be the next item for me to hunt for.<br/>
The<br/>
  Concert Hall (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/index.html)">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/index.html)</a> web site has a<br/>
  listing of weapons available to bards.<br/>
<br/>
  BTW, I&#39;m a level 26 bard. I used to fight primarily with Polished Granite<br/>
  Tomahawk and Dragoon Dirk, but was able to get Thulian Blade Claws and a<br/>
  Silvery War Axe (keeping my dirk in the range weapon slot) and am much<br/>
  happier when I get in a melee situation. While I really like the Tomahawk,<br/>
  it drains away my stamina in long fights. A guildmate gave me a Staff of<br/>
  Writhing, but since it doesn&#39;t proc until level 29 (?) I haven&#39;t really<br/>
used<br/>
  this due to it&#39;s weight.<br/>
<br/>
  Unfortunately, my 1 handed blunt is feeble at best. I&#39;m planning to go and<br/>
  buy a &quot;barshing&quot; weapon that has a low delay and maybe some +int jewelry<br/>
  since us bards are not all that bright. Takes me a long time to learn<br/>
  something new and all the alcohol doesn&#39;t help that. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  I was thinking maybe a combine 1 hb or screaming mace or maybe buy/find<br/>
one<br/>
  of the crystal staffs.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone have any other suggestions? It&#39;s best if it&#39;s relatively cheap<br/>
since<br/>
  I&#39;ll be tossing this aside when I get high enough to use the Staff of<br/>
  Writhing. I&#39;m not a camper since I can usually only be in EQ for a few<br/>
hours<br/>
  at a time so I usually end up buying it or stumbling across the spawn.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
