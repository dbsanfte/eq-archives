<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502178619">Grouping with a good enchanter can be frustrating. <br/>
You can&#39;t sing damage songs because they break Mezz. <br/>
You can&#39;t sing Anthem because it overwrites alacraty <br/>
(spelling).  You can&#39;t use Largo&#39;s or chain because<br/>
that interferes with their Slow spell.<br/>
<br/>
I usually sing COB, Psalm or warmth and Hymm.  Not<br/>
much else you can do at that point...<br/>
<br/>

Stupid bard, Shada?  I think not -- I always make a<br/>
point of reading certain posts and yours are always<br/>
among those.<br/>

&gt; there is very little for a bard to do to buff the<br/>
&gt; group, if anything but<br/>
&gt; mana.  that&#39;s a situation where you can do some song<br/>
&gt; damage (or take a<br/>
&gt; breather if an easy camp and just relax, 56 levels<br/>
&gt; of twisting songs is<br/>
&gt; killing my fingers), and i said many times that our<br/>
&gt; songs do a lot more<br/>
&gt; damage than our weapons.  but if a bard is there to<br/>
&gt; do the group buffing,<br/>
&gt; you are not going to be using songs to do damage. <br/>
&gt; that was my only point,<br/>
&gt; which i regret even trying to make since it did not<br/>
&gt; come across correctly,<br/>
&gt; and now i am the stupid bard who doesn&#39;t know how to<br/>
&gt; play.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m gonna have to agree to disagree on Sylly&#39;s<br/>
&gt; side. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Last night in Sebilis we had 2 groups.. including<br/>
&gt; a Shaman and <br/>
&gt; &gt; Enchanter (2 at one point).  I didn&#39;t need to<br/>
&gt; Haste, Slow, Snare (2 <br/>
&gt; &gt; druids), Heal (2 clerics, 2 druids, 1 shaman)... I<br/>
&gt; could have sang <br/>
&gt; &gt; battle buffs to buff some str and dex and such,<br/>
&gt; but there was only 1 <br/>
&gt; &gt; tank (Warrior) in my party... not a whole lot of<br/>
&gt; mileage gained.  So, <br/>
&gt; &gt; I chanted (with selo&#39;s drum) and I charmed (a<br/>
&gt; little) and I played <br/>
&gt; &gt; mana song and bind sight to help scout in the<br/>
&gt; downtime.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Was I being the most effective Bard I could be...<br/>
&gt; imho, Yes.  And was <br/>
&gt; &gt; that helpful to the group?  Hell, yes.  Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; forget the magic, fire, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and cold resistances you&#39;re also lowering on top<br/>
&gt; of the damage you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; &gt; doing.  That&#39;s helping every one of your nukers,<br/>
&gt; procing weapons, <br/>
&gt; &gt; overzealous druids with their newfound starburst,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
