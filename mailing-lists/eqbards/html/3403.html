perceived advantage of Accelerando and SoW is much greater<br/>
than the real advantage.  Ask people how much faster SoW makes<br/>
them run and most will say about twice as fast.  It certainly<br/>
looks about twice as fast, but it isn&#39;t.  Same thing with the<br/>
drum - a higher level bard said on the list that you ran like<br/>
twice as fast with it.  The speed is noticeably faster, but<br/>
nowhere near twice as fast.<br/>
<br/>
I tested the agility thing last night too. Absolutely ZERO<br/>
difference in running speed between a newbie human with 75<br/>
agility, a newbie human with 105 agility, and my wood elf bard<br/>
with 99 agility and 77/77 encumberance.<br/>
<br/>
I also tested movement speeds while encumbered or walking, and<br/>
I must say the programmers who work at Verant certainly don&#39;t<br/>
subscribe to the simpler is better philosophy.  :-)  The<br/>
results are all over, enough to draw some general guidelines,<br/>
but no simple proportions like I&#39;d expected.  I&#39;ll post them a<br/>
bit later.<br/>
