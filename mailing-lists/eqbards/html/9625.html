<div id="ygrps-yiv-114594071">We&#39;re nitpicking here - since our opinions aren&#39;t that far apart - but here<br/>
are my nits..<br/>
<br/>
1) Corpse change:  I found what I was talking about.  I thought I read on<br/>
EQVAULT something from Brad about it being done to decrease the number of<br/>
objects in the game&#39;s database.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, here&#39;s the patch message:September 28th, 7:00am<br/>
----------------------<br/>
<br/>
The following changes have been implemented with the latest patch, most<br/>
importantly, changes to corpse resurrection.  It should be noted that all<br/>
corpses generated previous to this patch may not be resurrected, however,<br/>
all corpses generated from this point forward may be resurrected with the<br/>
changes listed below applying.<br/>
<br/>
- Corpses that are older than 2 hours cannot be resurrected.<br/>
- Corpses that are produced from a duel cannot be resurrected after 10<br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) Database size - the point I was making there.  Keep in mind that there<br/>
are 250,000 current subscribers.  You have to include all former subscribers<br/>
as well for the period until the characters are purged.  I thought I heard<br/>
they will keep your account on the database for six months (not sure about<br/>
that).<br/>
<br/>
But regardless - a search on a 7 GB table on a high speed database is very<br/>
significant.  This is a very significant change to the system.<br/>
<br/>
The point I made and yet to be convinced otherwise; adding item decay times<br/>
is too significant of a coding change for it to be retro-fitted in the<br/>
current game.  If it were to be added - it would be in EQ2 - we&#39;ll never see<br/>
it in our existing game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not arguing that it&#39;s not a good idea...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; When were corpse decay times changed?  I thought only the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you had to get an experience res was changed?  AFAIK, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still last 8 hours online or 7 days offline.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was a change a while ago - I forget the nitty gritty.  It was was<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; multiple corpses of the same character.  They disappear much quicker.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps only if they have no items on it.  I&#39;m not sure if it was on the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only corpse decay time changes I recall were a general<br/>
&gt; overhaul so newbie corpses do not last as long, and empty<br/>
&gt; corpses do not last as long.<br/>
