<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587989366">I agree.  The stress and BOREDOM of camping is a major problem.   I <br/>
     have one suggestion for a fix and one current short term solution.<br/>
     <br/>
     Fix.  Randomly put the good stuff on different High level mobs.  Then <br/>
     have them appear randomly in their zone.  Simple. (maybe not to <br/>
     program but that&#39;s not my problem)  Why does only the avatar (?) get <br/>
     the ruby Breastplate, and doesn&#39;t he ever go to the bathroom, or take <br/>
     a stroll around his domain?  Visit his friends or check out why his <br/>
     guards are letting these hoards of uptight homicidal maniacs into his <br/>
     throne room...  This would add a random element to the location of the <br/>
     item and mob and would make camping at least a little less attractive. <br/>
      I HATE camping.<br/>
     <br/>
     My current solution:  Adventure, explore, and hang out with my friend <br/>
     who has a nose for Plat.  No exploits or cheating, he just knows where <br/>
     the good loot is.  So I hang with him about half the time and rack up <br/>
     the money and then I buy what I want when I have the Plat.  Much more <br/>
     fun.  True it helps if you are behind the experience wave.  Aas a 17th <br/>
     level I am well behind the power gamers so the stuff I want and can <br/>
     afford is usually for sale somewhere.  I go on shopping trips to the <br/>
     popular zones when my bank account is healthy spend it all on some <br/>
     neat new item. (I&#39;m buying bronze right now, kinda heavy but at least <br/>
     my character doesn&#39;t look like a stripper any more. :) )  Then off I <br/>
     go exploring, seeing new mobs and doing quests.  Much more fun.<br/>
     I spent all my time in Crushbone freeing slaves, never camped the <br/>
     usual spots once but I still have a Dragoon dirk.<br/>
     <br/>
     Just my 2 cents worth.  (anyone ever wonder what happened to the <br/>
     &#39;cent&#39; key?)<br/>

7. Cazic Thule is hell on Norrath. It isn&#39;t like each mob with Rucicite is <br/>
camped by a single party in a room somewhere (like Najena for instance). <br/>
No, most of the armor is camped by multiple parties, who have some sort of <br/>
system for figuring out which GROUP gets the next loot of something that <br/>
MIGHT have Rubicite. It is the silliest thing I have ever encountered in <br/>
EQ, and I have seen a lot of silliness.<br/>
     <br/>
8. Getting a reasonable amount of Rubicite would require sitting in Cazic <br/>
with a bunch of people who are constantly stressed about looting, and doing <br/>
this for a LONG time . . weeks or MONTHS.<br/>
     <br/>
9. Number 8 is not fun.<br/>
     <br/>
10. Verant&#39;s Biggest Mistake: To acquire the best items in Everquest, you <br/>
must often be willing to have no fun. This is insane. This is nuts.<br/>
