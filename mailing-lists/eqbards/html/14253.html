<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364686849">I&#39;d have to agree with you Harm.  Verant&#39;s biggest problem is, they show us<br/>
a picture of a delicious chocolate cream pie with fresh whipped cream.  we<br/>
never saw a chocolate cream pie like this before, yummy!  Then we get the<br/>
pie and the chocolates kinda stiff, the whipped cream is kinda runny, and<br/>
the crust tastes like cardboard.  We can all see the really great pie it<br/>
could be, but somehow it fell short.  This makes it much more painful than<br/>
if they just gave us a couple of really fresh HoHo&#39;s and called it good.<br/>

  [note: I keep debating on whether to send this out or not, I hate <br/>
         to keep busting Verant&#39;s chops, but I gotta cause I love<br/>
         the game and I want them to make it worth playing like it<br/>
         was so many, many months ago.  Delete this if you are tired<br/>
         of hearing the problems of the game, otherwise read on, agree<br/>
         or disagree, but if you flame me, I&#39;ll light my blowtorch and<br/>
         scorch anyone in my path ;)  I don&#39;t care to hear any people<br/>
         saying, speak with your money, or just leave.  If that&#39;s the<br/>
         bulk of your reply to this after you are done reading it, then<br/>
         don&#39;t bother sending it. ]<br/>

<br/>
  When have they not bungled code?  I bet the client and server code<br/>
  are so patched right now that adding anything new or changing existing<br/>
  subroutines is like trying to eat spaghetti with a spoon.<br/>
<br/>
  My client sometimes just plain crashes to the desktop.  Sometimes,<br/>
  on the chat server, boom... client to desktop.  Sometimes I get to<br/>
  the character select screen, press Quit, and boom to the desktop.<br/>
<br/>
  I have an SBLive card, Novemeber drivers, latest directX, but I&#39;ll<br/>
  be in the middle of typing something to the group, and boom desktop.<br/>
<br/>
  It didn&#39;t use to be this way.  I never crashed, ever.  But the magic<br/>
  four or five months ago, something in the code base was radically<br/>
  altered and I crash at least one a night now, and maybe once a week<br/>
  extra now due to the SBLive card hiccuping on a sound.<br/>
<br/>
  The patching process is so slow, especially when they don&#39;t prune<br/>
  the news... I mean it could take up to 5 seconds to watch that <br/>
  box fill up with text.  How hard is it just to put the text in a<br/>
  buffer and move it into the screen block... No, this is Verant and<br/>
  they draw each text line, letter by letter, word by word, line by<br/>
  line.  /yawn    (The accept, esc, esc, esc simply is irritating,<br/>
  and I wish someone would write a little crack program to adapt to<br/>
  the latest binary and bypass that garbage.)<br/>
<br/>
  Optional patch?  Nice idea, they used it once.  Hell, I never click<br/>
  on it anymore.  They simply don&#39;t utilize it.  Male barbarian shields,<br/>
  caster hats, bard instruments... nothing has been done about these<br/>
  images.  But you know what?  They gave necro pets the ability to cast,<br/>
  lol.<br/>
<br/>
  I love this game, if I didn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass about it&#39;s<br/>
  playability and such.  To fix a problem, you must identify the problem.<br/>
  Verant has an extremely hard time admitting they are wrong.  I mean it&#39;s <br/>
  like pulling teeth to get them to fess up to making mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
  I hate to be so &#39;doom and gloom&#39; because I want to be as much a part<br/>
  of this whole adventure as Verant wants me to be.  But everything is<br/>
  losing its luster in the big picture, not just bards, not just<br/>
  Harmonic -- a lot of people are complaining about various things.  <br/>
  While I don&#39;t see anything that compares to Everquest yet, I imagine<br/>
  a lot of people would love to move on.  That said, Asheron&#39;s Call <br/>
  sucks.  It doesn&#39;t suck a little, it sucks a lot.  So I&#39;m just <br/>
  spinning my wheels in EQ and doing crazy things I never did before<br/>
  to try to make it more fun. (ie. The Mistmoore Tower Suicide Run)<br/>
  I&#39;m not ready to leave the game, but I would like to want to stay.<br/>
  Verant isn&#39;t offering much in the &#39;we want you in our world&#39; area.<br/>
<br/>
  I like this game, I love the people, and the graphics are pretty<br/>
  at times.  I&#39;m trying not to let the lack of ability and coordination<br/>
  on the programmer&#39;s/designer&#39;s part hamper my journey in Norrath.<br/>
  I&#39;m trying not to let the fact that they are constantly fixing things<br/>
  that do not need to be addressed, while other more prominent &#39;features&#39;<br/>
  (read: bugs, bugs, bugs) exist in the game.  Instead of having the <br/>
  modeler toying around with bard avatar movements, how about adding<br/>
  some more emote actions to the game.  Instead of having the sound<br/>
  programmers add echo&#39;ing and sound effects, why don&#39;t they fix the<br/>
  sound card compatibility problems they&#39;ve been plaguing us with.<br/>
  And pathing, lord...  I&#39;ve seen better pathing in PacMan.  I mean<br/>
  FPS like Unreal and Halflife get it right.  Starcraft and many <br/>
  other Blizzard games have awesome tactical pathing.  Hell, even<br/>
  Westwood did a decent job at it with Command and Conquer.<br/>
<br/>
  What&#39;s Verant&#39;s problem?  Did all the key programmers bail?  And<br/>
  now some half-ass, idiot programmers are learning the ropes, toying<br/>
  with code?  It sure seems that way.  I&#39;ve noticed no really big <br/>
  changes are occuring.  Tweaking the numbers in a database, adding<br/>
  new items, changing a few mobs around with different loot.  How<br/>
  hard can that be?  I don&#39;t think they have the talent they once <br/>
  had to make this game spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
  I recently went to the Plane of Sky.  Got into the quest (Efreeti)<br/>
  room and found the appropriate bard efreeti.  Songjammer or Song<br/>
  something, anyway... I start talking to him, and I&#39;m standing there<br/>
  for like 10 minutes fighting the g&#39;damn text parser.  He&#39;s like not<br/>
  talking to me at all.  Paraphrased from like a week ago:<br/>
<br/>
  I want to begin the tests of song<br/>
<br/>
  &#39;I can offer you the tests of joy and of sorrow.  You must choose<br/>
   which person you would like to begin with:  Denise or Clarrisa&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  I want to begin the test of joy.<br/>
  I want to begin with Denise.<br/>
  Who is Denise?<br/>
  I want to begin the test of joy with Denise.<br/>
<br/>
  Bzzzzt.  Bzzzzzzt.  So sorry, hit the road, Harmonic.  heh.<br/>
<br/>
  The correct response is &#39;I choose Denise&#39;.  Ok, not quite clear,<br/>
  but I&#39;ll buy that, my mistake.<br/>
<br/>
  The efreeti poofs and Clarrisa appears... WTF?  I said I choose<br/>
  Denise you pos, ignorant, non-common speaking, crappy Efreeti.<br/>
<br/>
  Sheesh, the opening on the Plane of Sky is similar in my mind<br/>
  to the release of the game.  They hurried through it all, knowing<br/>
  there were missing things, incomplete areas and just released it.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t complain anymore that several songs are missing (not even<br/>
  created yet).  Whoever said they were waiting for the expansion<br/>
  to introduce new songs that were required for it is bullsh*t.<br/>
  The new L47 song (oops, we forgot to implement it) has nothing<br/>
  to do with the expansion, it is as all purpose as all the other<br/>
  songs we get.  Plus, GZ was like we want you to tell us what you <br/>
  think when it goes in the game (they hadn&#39;t created this song<br/>
  until a month or two ago and now they want it&#39;s viability).<br/>
<br/>
  I loved using all my songs when I was little, they were extremely<br/>
  definitive of a bard.  The only songs I play now are Clarity and <br/>
  Victory.  Sure Psalm songs can give dmg shields, a whopping 9 dmg.<br/>
  It just doesn&#39;t stack up like it did in the L30s.  What happened<br/>
  to Lament, what happened to Lullaby, hell what happened to Hymm.<br/>
  I outgrew all these songs.  And I never use them anymore.  If <br/>
  I try to Lament something and fail these days, it&#39;s like instant<br/>
  death.  If I fire up Lullaby in the PoF, I cannot even count to<br/>
  3 before I&#39;m dead.  Hymm is cool, but at L50 when you are healing<br/>
  tanks with 2k hp, it really sucks.  Hymm didn&#39;t grow as fast as<br/>
  I did.  It&#39;s much easier to Clarity a healer, than to even think<br/>
  about mixing Hymm.  It&#39;s simply not worth the effort.  I love my<br/>
  Charm song, I never get to use it however as I don&#39;t fight many <br/>
  things that are L37 or lower.  Yet another song I outgrew.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve got all these neat sounding Instruments, what do they do?  Not <br/>
  much.  Oooh, a Lute of the Gypsy Princess -- that must be really cool,<br/>
  or a God Flute, that must do wonderous things... I wish.  Need to pick<br/>
  up Kelin&#39;s Lute so I can heal for 3 more pts... whopptiedoo.  Bonus<br/>
  modifiers on instruments?  How about +magic, or +FR/CR?  Yeah +DEX is<br/>
  really cool, too bad this lute/drum/flute/horn doesn&#39;t proc anything.<br/>
  +STR on it?  Wow... I can now punch for closer to max 13 dmg, ooooh.<br/>
<br/>
  My arms have +INT and my helmet too!  Just what I wanted.  <br/>
  All my skills are friggin 200 already, and I have +INT gear I use<br/>
  for skill/trades.  How about some more +STR/+AGI ?  I killed like<br/>
  20 scorn banshees, and not one dropped a damn thing last week in <br/>
  Hate.  If it&#39;s that hard to get to these planes, get setup, and<br/>
  get killing things, I would like a lot of the items to be worth<br/>
  it -- not just for bards, but _all_ classes.  Some mask dropped <br/>
  in PoF three weeks ago, everyone let it rot because they already<br/>
  had a non-planar piece that was better.... good job, here&#39;s your<br/>
  low ac, +1 int mask.  Thank you, drive thru.<br/>
<br/>
  Argh, Verant is losing touch, and it&#39;s definitely frustrating to<br/>
  see my friends and myself so disappointed in this very promising<br/>
  game.<br/>
