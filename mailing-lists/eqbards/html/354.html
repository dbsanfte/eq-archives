<div id="ygrps-yiv-125888806">I was talking to a player who sold me a pair of banded wristbands (or<br/>
whatever they&#39;re called) for 4 plat a piece (raw mat&#39;l is 2.5 plat on 100%<br/>
success I think). When I asked what his smithing skill was he said around<br/>
84. He was just to the point where he could make the wristbands and mantles<br/>
fairly easily (I&#39;m guessing +40% chance of success) and he said his friends<br/>
sunk more than 500 plat into the skill.<br/>
<br/>
	Now that&#39;s a bit sobering...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

What goes through a smith&#39;s mind when they sell a banded helm for 10pp?<br/>
That is cost, assuming a 30% success rate (which I believe requires<br/>
a skill level requiring an investment of HUNDREDS of platinum).<br/>

OK, time for my medicine now.  8)<br/>
