<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947534317"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My other concern is etiquette. Nobody was around the spectres and the<br/>
island was unbroken. As soon as I broke the spawn there were 3 other groups<br/>
who jumped in and started pulling spectres. One even ran us over with their<br/>
pull while we were medding and healing. I guess it&#39;s bound to happen since<br/>
I&#39;m pulling the spectres so far away. Seems rude on from one perspective,<br/>
but from another it seems inevitable unless you are sitting smack dab on<br/>
the island.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found that a lot on Bertoxx.  At first, I just thought it was a<br/>
coincidence that when my group broke the spawn up a bit, dr00ds started<br/>
pulling singles to kite.  However, of the past 4 or 5 times we&#39;ve hunted the<br/>
specs, the story&#39;s always the same.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s limited flat areas around the Spectre island to pull to that<br/>
aren&#39;t occupied by lower levels.  Typically, most people pull to the side<br/>
with the inn on it, or at the top near the Dervish camp.  It&#39;s inevitable<br/>
that someone will pull across you, or be chasing a spectre through you,<br/>
especially if you&#39;re medding/healing on it&#39;s path.</div>
