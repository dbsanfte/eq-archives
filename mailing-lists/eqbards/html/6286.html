<div id="ygrps-yiv-809805420">I knew I should have qualifed what I was saying more.  What I was talking <br/>
about is NOT killing guards in the newbie zones, but actually going into the <br/>
city zone.  This is something completely different and much more dangerous, <br/>
especially when the ninja shopkeepers join in.  I saw one of these Ninja <br/>
Merchants kill a Hill Giant in East Karana last (I have no idea how the <br/>
fight started).  She was double punching the HG for 132 yikes!<br/>

&gt;OK,<br/>
&gt;BEFORE this gets KABONG&#39;d..and it will, no doubt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You have hit on my PERSONAL PET PEEVE.  NOTHING annoys<br/>
&gt;my more than level 50 people, bored, sitting in Newbie<br/>
&gt;zones and killing the guards there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night, there was a level 50 Warrior sitting in<br/>
&gt;Rivervale killing the Town guards.  Not the Wall<br/>
&gt;guards, where the average player who runs to them is<br/>
&gt;level 5 to 12, but the town ones...where the only<br/>
&gt;players running to them is around level 1 to 3.<br/>
&gt;I spent 2 hours helping every newbie I could there<br/>
&gt;(with my Cleric, so I could heal them).  Its hard<br/>
&gt;enough for a newbie to start on older servers, without<br/>
&gt;high level IDIOTS making things tougher on them for a<br/>
&gt;lark (NOTE:  It was on MM, and No, it was NOT<br/>
&gt;Shada...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Everyone kills the Inky guards in Nek forest.  That<br/>
&gt;must make life Soooo fun for the New Dark Elf players.<br/>
&gt;  All I&#39;m asking is that you THINK about your actions<br/>
&gt;BEFORE you do something that may have such an impact.<br/>
