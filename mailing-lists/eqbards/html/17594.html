<div id="ygrps-yiv-273985401">Yes I did notice, sorry to only notice the bad things ;-) force of habit.  I<br/>
also liked this one (potentially adds a bit more depth IMHO):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate<br/>
action of the spell. Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your spell<br/>
line-up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not exactly sure what it means but I think it means there are a couple<br/>
of new spell icons so every dang buff doesn&#39;t look exactly the same, I hope<br/>
so anyway.  Not necessary but a welcomed addition.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the <br/>
&gt; instrument in<br/>
&gt; use.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wooo! *In theory* Charm and Cinda&#39;s just got stronger...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and this too:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - You can now right-click-and-hold on bard songs to determine what<br/>
&gt; instrument skill is used by the spell. </span></blockquote></div>
