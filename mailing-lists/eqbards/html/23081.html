&gt; &gt; day.  Also, if you can get your hands on some Singing Steel Gauntlets, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can eliminate the Ayre, irrespective of level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not quite, all the kunark armor has a level restriction of 45th to use the<br/>
&gt;right click effects. If someone is going to use the entry level area they<br/>
&gt;are really better off just making friends with a shaman, druid or ranger.<br/>
&gt;Rebreathers and waterstones are great as well. The problem with bringing a<br/>
&gt;mage down there is that soon they realize they don&#39;t need help.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the singing steel gauntlets are not a right click effect, they are an intrinsic.<br/>
you get the effect regardless of level.  of course that doesn&#39;t really help the<br/>
rest of the party heh.</div>
