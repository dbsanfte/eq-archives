<b>Subject:</b> Levels after hell levels <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267198493">I haven&#39;t experienced this for myself (I didn&#39;t die while I was 31st) but<br/>
some friends of mine have and this is their theory.  The theory is that that<br/>
there are three different level types: regular levels, hell levels, and<br/>
hell+1 levels.  The EXP required to get through each level type is<br/>
different.  For example purposes, lets say it take 2000 EXP points to get<br/>
from 34 to 35 level (regular).  To get from 35 to 36 it takes 4000 EXP<br/>
points (hell).  From 36 to 37 it only takes 1000 EXP points (hell +1).<br/>
However, when you die, you lose the same amount of experience no matter what<br/>
level you are.  So in this case, dying at 34th amounts to 1/2 bar loss, 1/4<br/>
bar lossat 35, and a full bar at 36.  The end result is that when you die<br/>
during a hell+1 level, it appears that you lose more EXP because the EXP bar<br/>
drops more than it would if you were in a regular or hell level.  But in<br/>
actuality you lost the same amount of EXP.  The converse to this is that<br/>
because it doesn&#39;t take as much EXP to gain the next level at hell+1 levels,<br/>
you can actually recover the lost EXP much faster.<br/>
<br/>
Like I say this is all just a theory but I do know that it only took me one<br/>
day (about 8 hours playing) to get thru 31st level so that leads me to<br/>
believe that the amount of EXP required to get through a hell+1 level is<br/>
much less than a regular level (which seem to take considerably more than 8<br/>
hours for me).  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Obviously - but it still doesn&#39;t account for that fact that deaths at 31<br/>
&gt; caused MUCH more xp lose than deaths at 29, 32, 33, and 34.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; made<br/>
&gt; it to 37.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most of my guildmates are at about the same level as I am (or slightly<br/>
&gt; higher) and this seems to be the case for them as well...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just lost .75 bub dying at 36.  Happened at 31.  Never saw a death cause<br/>
&gt; that much xp loss at ANY other levels..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Remember it takes 2-4 times the exp in the hell level.  You are losing<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same amount of exp, just looks like less because of the amount it takes<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; gain a level.<br/>
