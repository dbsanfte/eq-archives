<div id="ygrps-yiv-161590548">&quot;I used to use it a LOT on test to get things off the evac&#39;er&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loaded Dirge a few times specifically as a taunt.  I&#39;ve found it<br/>
incredibly unreliable compared to just Screeching, since our Evac&#39;er has<br/>
often done far more damage or healing than Dirge by the time we realize we<br/>
need to Evac.  In the old days, even Lullaby would have been more reliable<br/>
(ie, back when the resist rate wasn&#39;t such crap, and it wiped the hate<br/>
list).<br/>
<br/>
As an example to the (unusually) low taunt of Dirge: we decided to blitz the<br/>
Sol B king room with full spawn, since we had an enchanter with us.  I told<br/>
them I&#39;d lead with Dirge as we ran in, which I did.  You&#39;d expect that at<br/>
least one mob would have rushed me, but all 3 latched onto our warrior as he<br/>
ran in (ie, he hadn&#39;t even taunted or hit anything yet.)<br/>
