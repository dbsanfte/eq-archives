<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201992403">Sorry bob, rough day at work yesterday :-(<br/>
<br/>
On another topic, we had a running discussion thread yesterday which went by<br/>
&quot;Center of attention&quot; and I wanted to add some input on recent Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
2 nights ago I died 3 times with the crazy mob behavior...our group was<br/>
camped directly back from the back door of the house against the wall, and<br/>
the back door would open, and really high-level stuff would just run out of<br/>
the house all the way to the fence where I was standing and kill me.  I just<br/>
stood there the first time and died because I could not believe they were<br/>
charging straight at me with no apparent agitation...our puller was sitting<br/>
medding and we hadn&#39;t been in the house for a while (granted, part of the<br/>
problem was also that my group was awful and I should have taken the 1 other<br/>
good player and left after the first death...)<br/>
<br/>
Last night in Unrest I camped off the side porch because there was a<br/>
discussion that singing songs off the back porch might be affecting mobs in<br/>
the basement due to an unlimited Z axis affect bug.  I also did not stand<br/>
around and sing songs while our puller was in the house...I waited until our<br/>
kill was brought to the fence and whacked once or twice and then kicked in<br/>
my playlist.  This worked awesome and I did not die once.<br/>
<br/>
I think the people I group with generally recognize that I do a lot as a<br/>
bard, shuffling instruments and weapons, jumping in and out of physical<br/>
melee, playing a variety of different songs, some &quot;simultaneously&quot;  - and<br/>
they also recognize the benefit of our songs because I tell them things like<br/>
&quot;check out your magic resist&quot; and get the &quot;wholly crap!&quot; or invis people<br/>
while they are medding and they are amazed that it works against undead too.<br/>
Our party was sitting against the fence medding and watching a Festering Hag<br/>
run around the yard wasting people, finally being killed by a group only 15<br/>
feet away from us - we watched the whole thing as the group leader nervously<br/>
commented &quot;don&#39;t stop singing that song Faras...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you explain the nuances of your class to a group that is interested in<br/>
working together, then usually they understand and accommodate, especially<br/>
if you are busting your arse to benefit the group and they are aware of it.<br/>
When we decided to camp the Barkeep room I was terribly nervous because the<br/>
Festering Hag was right in the room above us making all kinds of racket with<br/>
the people camping that room.  I told them I wasn&#39;t comfortable with playing<br/>
a lot of my usual songs and explained the &quot;Z axis bug&quot; and the song affects<br/>
through walls thing - they were totally cool with my concerns and<br/>
accommodated accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the moral is don&#39;t be a lazy bard and don&#39;t be a 1-hit wonder.  When<br/>
you find a good group that you work well with, take down names because that<br/>
is when you all can really shine - <br/>

&gt; &gt;You obviously either did not understand my question in the way that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;phrased it, or are being a smart ass because you have <br/>
&gt; nothing better to do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think I had a valid question: Does the tentacle whip proc <br/>
&gt; more at higher<br/>
&gt; &gt;levels?  If you don&#39;t know there is no need to make me look <br/>
&gt; like a fool<br/>
&gt; &gt;because you are bored.  I barely add any comments to this <br/>
&gt; group as it is,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and I certainly am not inclined to continue participating if <br/>
&gt; every time I<br/>
&gt; &gt;comment I get some smart ass being cute with me.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think it is likely that the frequency an item procs is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; affects by your<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Dexterity, and in some cases by your level as well.  Would<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the whip be more<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; effective if at, say, level 25 it proc&#39;d 80% of the time<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; compared with the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 20% (or whatever) it does at lower levels?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have no idea about this, just wondering...<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ummmm....Yeah, anything that does something 80% of the time<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; instead of 20%<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; is going to be a BIT more effective....around 60% more <br/>
&gt; effective....<br/>
