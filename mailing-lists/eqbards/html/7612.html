it takes some time to gain the exp back.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shada: what you say in your last sentence sums up the whole issue.  For me<br/>
&gt;at least, the time spent travelling back to your corpse from multiple zones<br/>
&gt;away is not fun and completely boring.  That time could be better spent<br/>
&gt;adventuring, which is the fun part of EQ to me.  Lets say on average it<br/>
&gt;takes you 15 minutes to get back to your corpse.  If you could get bound in<br/>
&gt;non-cities, the amount of EXP you could gain during those 15 minutes is<br/>
&gt;nowhere near the amount you lost when you died.  However, you get to spend<br/>
&gt;that 15 minutes playing the game in whatever manner makes it fun for you.<br/>
&gt;IMO, the binding issue isn&#39;t a class balance issue but a &quot;Is this really<br/>
&gt;what I want to be spending my valuable game time doing&quot; issue.  Don&#39;t take<br/>
&gt;any offense, but based on the fact that you have a 50th level character and<br/>
&gt;two 20+ level characters, you obviously have more time to devote to playing<br/>
&gt;EQ than I do.  My only character is my 23d level bard and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
&gt;him since April.  That gives you a pretty good idea how much time I get to<br/>
&gt;play.  As I have said before, for casual gamers who don&#39;t get to play EQ<br/>
&gt;that much, not being able to bind in non-cities has a major impact.  When I<br/>
&gt;die, that pretty much writes off the rest of the gaming session for me.<br/>
&gt;Thats why I support a change to the policy.<br/>

&gt;&gt; sorry i don&#39;t see the connection.  i advocate not letting melee/hybrid<br/>
&gt;&gt; classes to be able to bind, making the game harder.  how does that make<br/>

&gt;&gt; no one likes dying, not just some folks.  that&#39;s the point, it is bad to<br/>
&gt;&gt; die.  if there were no consequences, there would be no challenge.  is<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; enough of a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; penalty, thank you very much.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; This is where the paradigm falls back to singlemindset games<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - that there<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; has to be a way to &#39;keep score&#39; - that puts the emphasis on<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; advancement and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; competition with others - instead of living in the world, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; working with<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; others.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; You cannot &#39;win&#39; in a persistent world - nor should the goals be<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; artificially propped up to encourage that attitude.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; One of EQs major shortcomings - is there is a perceived<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;end&#39;. Games - read<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;worlds&#39; of this nature are going to have to mature past the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; singleplayer<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; game mindset baggage they have towed along with them, for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; these worlds to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; truly reach their full potential.<br/>
