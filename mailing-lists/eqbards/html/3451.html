Our guild seems rather friendly when it comes to having non-guild members<br/>
group with us (on The Rathe).  I know there are lots of jerk-guilds out<br/>
there, but one thing you might try doing is asking a guild group that you<br/>
see if they can use you.   Chances are there&#39;s at least one bright person in<br/>
the group that knows the benefits of having a bard.<br/>
