<div id="ygrps-yiv-773131731">It is like that with some 2H Slash weapons as well.<br/>
	When I had first started in release and all the big stuff started getting<br/>
found I sorta comlained a bit that there were no real bard specific weapons<br/>
or armor (cept now for the Fear Plane). Then one of my friends pointed<br/>
something out, something that I&#39;ve been noticing more and more. Even though<br/>
bards don&#39;t have specific things, I think they can use more stuff than<br/>
anyone. I think it&#39;s the staff of writhing or observer that is NEC WIZ MAG<br/>
ENC and BRD. BRD? WTF? Many more things are like that too. Why can a bard<br/>
use it? I think that&#39;s our benefit that goes right along with our JOAT<br/>
trait.<br/>
	My thought anyway...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>
