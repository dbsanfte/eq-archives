<div id="ygrps-yiv-879758807">I have to agree with this post 100 percent.  Basically this song ALLOWED us<br/>
to be backup crowd control for Enchanters.  It clearly fit in with the &quot;Jack<br/>
of ALL trades master of none&quot; concept.  Because of the 3 second resist<br/>
check - it was clearly inferior to the enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
I remember using it extensively in the Flag Room in Permafrost.  Like an<br/>
Enchanter - if the party didn&#39;t know how to assist  - I&#39;d die followed by<br/>
the rest of the party (most likely).  It required knowledge and discipline<br/>
for the whole party.<br/>
<br/>
The four mob limit was a valid and proper limitation of the song.  Often<br/>
another group would train us - and we were toast when we had more than four<br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I&#39;ve argued vehemently against these nerfs - I just don&#39;t<br/>
see a valid argument for the so-called class limit.  I don&#39;t see what a 49th<br/>
bard with high Charisma should be able to use it at 49th level to fill in<br/>
for an Enchanter when the group doesn&#39;t have one.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see that a 30 percent resist (and I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s really that<br/>
low) is reasonable.<br/>

I&#39;m not certain how many of you bards had the chance to use Lullaby<br/>
pre-stealth nerf so for the sake of discussion let me clarify something.<br/>
<br/>
Singing Lullaby pre-stealth nerf was always a risky situation for bards.  In<br/>
no way was it overpowerful.  The reasons for that are very similar to those<br/>
enchanters have to<br/>
