<div id="ygrps-yiv-593187871">There are a couple ways.  You can read books to raise your skill.  Good luck<br/>
finding a book on Lizardman though.  The other way is more difficult and<br/>
time consuming and dates back to Dragonrealms.  In that game you built xp in<br/>
a skill by learning it from another and sometimes when that xp cleared it<br/>
would leave you 1 pt higher than your teacher.  Searching for a way to do<br/>
this in EQ, some clever fellow found that a teacher can teach you to 1 pt<br/>
higher than he has.  You then both zone, reverse the teaching, rinse, repeat<br/>
until at excellent.<br/>

&gt; No, if you train at your GM for one point you don&#39;t get Excellent.  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have not tested it, but I assume you get (level at which the skill <br/>
&gt; appeared on the trainer&#39;s list) + 1 skill points, which translates to <br/>
&gt; awful or some such (don&#39;t remember the category names, but suffice it to <br/>
&gt; say, you stink at it.  hehe)<br/>
<br/>
Then please clear something up for those of us who don&#39;t fully<br/>
understand this.<br/>
<br/>
Given:<br/>
<br/>
- Your skill is awful when you first train it.<br/>
- You need a teacher who is excellent to train it up to excellent.<br/>
- Everyone started the game at level 1 and awful at everything.<br/>
<br/>
How did the first person who got a language skill to excellent<br/>
get it to excellent?<br/>
