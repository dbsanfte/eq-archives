   The bard was a GM and this looks like the beginning of one hellified<br/>
quest / event<br/>
  The Tale of Veeshans Veil<br/>
<br/>
  A drake perches on Sainy&#39;s head.<br/>
  From the worlds core, the rock children rose, Shielded from wurms eyes by<br/>
dirt and stone.<br/>
  With gnarled hands and broken bones, they carved their place into Veeshans<br/>
Home.<br/>
  Soon after, the woodlands and deserts and swamps. All nurtured life<br/>
planted by interloping Gods.<br/>
  Veeshan left her children, in peaks carved by her claws, turned her back<br/>
on Norrath, and her fellow Gods laws.<br/>
  The Crystalline Dragon content in her lair, Sealed off Sky and still<br/>
slumbers there.<br/>
  Some dragons went mad, apart from their queen, Others took charge and<br/>
formed a wurm ring.<br/>
  The rebels were hunted and sent from the peaks, To dwell in the lands<br/>
inhabited by the weak.<br/>
  One of these rebels a lady white as snow, Swept up a shard of nature<br/>
unknown.<br/>
  As years dragged on one by one the wurms fell, Into a deep slumber from<br/>
what no one could tell.<br/>
  Their magic had faded, because of the shard? Or perhaps from the magic<br/>
they call Veeshans Veil.<br/>
  Now a new verse to this legend Ill share. In regards to the Sky and what<br/>
is happening there.<br/>
  Veeshan still slumbers, the veil has worn thin, The Wurm Queen neglect<br/>
wakes her children again.<br/>
  My song is done, but I will warn you to heed the words of my verse for the<br/>
speak the truth. Mortals now visit where Veeshan slumbers, and only dragons<br/>
once dwelled.<br/>
  A drake puffs its chest with pride.<br/>
  But the door to the Sky is not a one way portal. There is much to learn<br/>
from the great Wurms, and much to fear.<br/>
  Sainy bows.<br/>
  Come my friend it is time to move on.<br/>
  A drake purrs.<br/>
