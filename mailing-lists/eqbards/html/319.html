<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830354529">REFERENCE PRICES WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC BEFORE YOU BUY!<br/>
<br/>
(I know the following is understood by most people, but if it helps out ONE<br/>
person, then I&#39;m happy.)<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t jack up prices, purely out of respect for others,<br/>
however, I don&#39;t feel that those who do are completely ignoble.  What is<br/>
keeping newbies from asking others what prices are fair before they blow<br/>
their hard earned cash?  The same goes for the experienced adventurer when<br/>
dealing with the occasional magic item or relic.  If they don&#39;t, they really<br/>
are punishing themselves, and in my opinion are half responsible for their<br/>
own ill fortune.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people buying minotaur axes for as much as EIGHT plat.<br/>
Considering most half-decent scam artists don&#39;t even advertise the price on<br/>
/auction, it just makes it just TOO easy.  I am friends with a high level<br/>
player who bought a runed totem staff for 40 platinum.  That is ALSO<br/>
extremely high, but the vendor assured him he was getting the lowest price<br/>
possible.  I&#39;ve seen them go for as low as 20Plat, but the average would<br/>
have to be around 30 plat.  Don&#39;t worry, I make fun of him all the time for<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
So, please, before you fork over your plat to a greedy vendor, ask a friend<br/>
about  the prices.  If you don&#39;t have anyone you trust to ask, then ask on<br/>
/ooc, or /auction.  Whatever you do, don&#39;t take ONE PERSONS word on it,<br/>
especially if they are selling you the item.  I hope you wouldn&#39;t in real<br/>
life!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
