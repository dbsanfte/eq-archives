<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994513535">I was in Lower Guk just last night... at least I thought it was. It was <br/>
my first time down there. As I finished zoning, it said &#39;You have entered <br/>
old ruins of guk. (is that lower guk?)<br/>
   I zoned in as a higher level dude was slaying a shin ghoul knight; the <br/>
very mob (one of) from which I need to loot a lambent quest item. I had my <br/>
invis song going as per usual. All through upper I noticed that everything <br/>
was indifferent to me. YAY! Ok, song is working like a charm. I did manage <br/>
to con the shin ghoul knight while he was being attacked. &quot;A Shin Ghoul <br/>
Knight scowls at you, ready to attack. What would you like your tombstone to <br/>
say?&quot; Um ok, first reaction is to zone, especially since he was just inches <br/>
away  from me. The guy was using the zone line as a buffer, apparently. NP. <br/>
Zoned... Went LD... That&#39;s where I am as it stands.<br/>
   So, at 19 so far, from what I think is lower (?), can see through invis. <br/>
Now, whether or not your invis ability increases as you level or not, is <br/>
something i know zero about.<br/>
   All I know is I was happy to get invis so I can get down to lower guk to <br/>
get these items (shin greaves and gauntlets) before i had a chance to either <br/>
go hunt there for exp, or get some faction hits somewhere else.<br/>
