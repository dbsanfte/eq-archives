<div id="ygrps-yiv-324841629">hehehehe well thats really not so bad.  Before I tell anyone my played time<br/>
I make them swear a blood oath to make no comments about my lack of a life!<br/>
I can&#39;t remember Halana&#39;s offhand but its over 200 as well.  Tani is 23 and<br/>
12 of those were getting from level 1 to 12.  Non powerleveled/twinked<br/>
characters that are around 2 years old all have played times that long I<br/>
think.  I mean just think of all the time we&#39;ve wasted at camps, gaining exp<br/>
back and running back to corpses before resses were so readily available.<br/>
Think of all the time its taken us to do Epics, or get our Pre-Kunark<br/>
armor... and all that time we just sat around chatting (well worth it too!)<br/>

&gt; Welp, my /played times are somewhat unrealistic because I tend to let<br/>
&gt; characters idle a great deal.  My bard - which is the one I <br/>
&gt; have played the<br/>
&gt; most was started in May &#39;99 and has 220 days /played - <br/>
&gt; although like I said,<br/>
&gt; lots of time idle (fell alseep crossing West Karana or just <br/>
&gt; zoning more<br/>
&gt; times than I care to recount).  But, I login about 6pm on <br/>
&gt; weekdays and stay<br/>
&gt; till 10pm - sometimes 11 or 12.  Weekends, begin around 8am <br/>
&gt; and go, on and<br/>
&gt; off, til midnight or 2am - with the occasional all-nighter - <br/>
&gt; like last Sat<br/>
&gt; when our little group killed the PoD in Gfay, rescued a <br/>
&gt; Freeti room wipe<br/>
&gt; out, then as we were killing the fire giants, saw Ragefire spawn so we<br/>
&gt; called in a cleric friend and killed a dragon.  The monk in <br/>
&gt; our group won a<br/>
&gt; Cloak of Flames and our warrior won a red dragon scale at 4am <br/>
&gt; when the dust<br/>
&gt; settled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And ya, my house is a mess, girl friend moved out a year ago, <br/>
&gt; the lawn needs<br/>
&gt; mowing, and I order food for delivery way too often.  But any <br/>
&gt; zone I enter,<br/>
&gt; someone invariably sends me a greeting!  ;)<br/>
