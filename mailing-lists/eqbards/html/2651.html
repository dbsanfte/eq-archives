<b>Subject:</b> Re: New Songs on vendors, any word? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-379937428">From Patch message:<br/>
Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant (BARD) now works on monsters<br/>
Tuyen&#39;s Songs (BARD) have had their damage increased.<br/>
New Bard Songs have been added to vendors.<br/>
<br/>
And what IS the song count now? will it ever get above 50 *smiles* such that we might be able to buy<br/>
more than one at a certain level?<br/>
<br/>
Greed is SO ugly, but I just HAD to ask,<br/>
