   IMHO i love that &quot;surfing&quot; look as we speed across the lands. It does in <br/>
fact set us apart from any other class, along with the fact that no other <br/>
can sing. =P<br/>
   If Verant changes our animation, I&#39;ll absolutely die! hehe Only becuase <br/>
I&#39;m a gnarly dude, I don&#39;t know about anyone else LOL!<br/>
   And yes, I&#39;m still awaiting the strumming the drum effect to be debugged, <br/>
although we look like we&#39;re playing air guitar. So it&#39;s all good i suppose.<br/>

&gt; &gt; in a cacophony of light bubbles.  It will be a sad day indeed when even<br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt; &gt; appearance is nerfed.  Heaven above forbid bards should look cooler at<br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt; time than someone else.  That might be unbalancing.  Never mind that we<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a stick for a drum, and we strum it!<br/>
