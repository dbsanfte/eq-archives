<div id="ygrps-yiv-517587365">I found Tizmak&#39;s to be very safe to solo at 32-33.  You can fear/chain them<br/>
very safely by pulling them down from their cave entrances to the coldain<br/>
patrolled valley.  I have not seen any wanderers other than coldain come<br/>
into that valley.  Trains sometimes come into the waterfall part of the<br/>
valley, but not the offshoot that leads to the druid circle in Great Divide.<br/>

You may wanna try to hit EC Saturday morning and buy a Yak or two.<br/>
Good place for ya to get to 32 is Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
Follow the path along the hillside into the Sarnak fortress, then when it<br/>
ends, go up and to the right.  There is a plateau there where you can pull<br/>
to where the sarnaks don&#39;t go.<br/>
After you no longer get exp there, either head to Frontier Mountains and<br/>
kill giants at the camp there (or anything in that zone actually), or head<br/>
to the FV giants and get in a good group there.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Armor and Weapon Advice<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello all. I have been playing EQ very sparingly the last few months.<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if I could some equipment/weapon advice (or point me<br/>
&gt; to a post, etc..) for my bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am on the Rathe, Level 30 almost 31. I should be able to hit 32<br/>
&gt; next week. I would like to try and get XP and a chance at upgrading my<br/>
&gt; stuff. I don&#39;t have a lot of cash either. I am currently in Cazic<br/>
&gt; Thule going between the Temple and TR&#39;s whereever I can find a group<br/>
&gt; (it&#39;s fun going from Main Tank, to healer (only healer at one point),<br/>
&gt; to crowd control).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If any of you can suggest some upgrades and price ranges I would<br/>
&gt; appreciate it.<br/>
