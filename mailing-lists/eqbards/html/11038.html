<b>Subject:</b> My Twinking Solution <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692707784">Bear with me for a couple of paragraphs while I go over my thoughts on<br/>
twinking.  If you want just read My Solution, skip to the end.<br/>
<br/>
Like many of you, Twinking has become a bigger issue as of late.  As first I<br/>
didn&#39;t care, but serveral incidents have started me thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t care if you hand something down to a lower level if you don&#39;t<br/>
have a need for it.  This doesn&#39;t affect me directly so I could care less.<br/>
If that level 5 Paladin is wearing full bronze because his &quot;older brother&quot;<br/>
upgraded to Crafted Armor (or plane armor) more power to them.<br/>
<br/>
But lately I see more and more people camping items they don&#39;t need just to<br/>
twink.  Several times my group has went to get a specific item and found it<br/>
camped by a higher level that can&#39;t use the item.  On several occasions, the<br/>
players confessed that he was twinking his guild or his newbie character.<br/>
<br/>
Another time in a pickup group, a wizard tried to claim the first Bronze<br/>
Armor loot, said he needed it for twinking his new character. (I dropped out<br/>
of that group in a hurry).  I&#39;ve seen several instances like this.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to talk about any killstealing encounters.  Were they there<br/>
just for the profits, or were they looking to twink as well?<br/>
<br/>
If someone prevents me from getting an item I want because they want to<br/>
twink, I feel as if I am being robbed.  Now, everytime I look at a twinked<br/>
character, I wonder if someone deserving was denied access to that item so<br/>
the twink could occur.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My Twinking Solution really isn&#39;t a solution.  Most of the proposed<br/>
solutions involving level limits and NoDrop items won&#39;t affect twinking that<br/>
much, but would have a negative effect on normal players too.<br/>
<br/>
Instead my group has started playing on the Team PvP servers a few times a<br/>
month.  Twinking doesn&#39;t nearly seem to be as common.  If a level 5 is<br/>
running around with Quest Armor, there is a good chance that he will get<br/>
popped and have his armor taken from him a piece at a time.<br/>
<br/>
It also seems that because of the PvP nature, items are not quite as<br/>
plentiful.  This has the wonderful aspect of actually making the tradeskills<br/>
(Tailoring and Blacksmithing) useful again.  It is totally different from<br/>
the &quot;carebear&quot; servers, and not the bloodbath I had initially expected.<br/>
