   &lt; And now on to my problem, where do I pick up the plat to buy this wonderful armor?  I seem to only make around 5 pp a night at best.  Would joining a guild help me in this situation? &gt; <br/>

I did not seem to have the big problem with money that you seem to be having..., I bought it piece by piece from levels 9-11, had a full set since 12, I have no money making skills, EXCEPT, many, many friends made from helping them along the way. They, when selling allowed me to drive a bargain, usually 2-3p less than what was normal for each piece, then I would sell the leather.  I also sold collars and earrings to finance alot of this.  Remember Bards are a Social class.  The other thing I did to make money was Travel and learn all the zones, and spawn points from Qeynos to Freeport, and later on G. Faydark, by doing this I would sit in Qeynos and advertise going to Freeport or Beyond at Bardspeed, expert guide, get there Fast and safe.  People payed me up to 3p per head (average 1p per head) for the speedy safe trip. Sounds silly but It worked. And with /follow you can do it easier than I did.  This took away some levelling time, but it allowed me to finance the equipment to level much easier and more efficiently.<br/>
