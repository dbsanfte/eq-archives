<b>Subject:</b> New bard quests? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008501212">Last night I logged on after the latest update patch.  I got the message<br/>
that new items and quests were added.  I went to the Bards Guild in Kelethin<br/>
and talked to all the people there.  Unfortunately, there is no new bard<br/>
quest in Kelethin.  Has anyone discovered if there is a new bard quest at<br/>
any other location?<br/>
