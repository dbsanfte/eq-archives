<div id="ygrps-yiv-79445537">And yet they continually complain that all players do when they try to run<br/>
an event is nuke the npc&#39;s to see what they drop.<br/>
<br/>
They need to change the name to EverDing apparently.  They have done some<br/>
improving in the are of static quests, but their dynamic events are<br/>
universally stupid.  Granted a big part of that is because they refuse to<br/>
exclude people whose participation is inappropriate and some of those people<br/>
insist on taking everything they can grab.<br/>
<br/>
They already have quests that npc&#39;s won&#39;t give you if you are over a certain<br/>
level, this is just a suggestion to extend that to dynamic events in order<br/>
to allow them to run dynamic events for people who will more than likely<br/>
never reach 50th.  Of course I said that once about 30th level, but there<br/>
wasn&#39;t anyone at 60th then.<br/>

But that would violate The Vision(tm).  Abashi has said all alone that<br/>
players who devote more time to the game are the ones most entitled to reap<br/>
the rewards.  Casual gamers be damned.<br/>
