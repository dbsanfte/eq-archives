<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336325958">I believe DriectX 7 is installed by default with Win2k.  The problem with <br/>
Win2k and playing games is that most of the 3D type cards do not have very <br/>
good drivers for Win2k.  I use Win2k with a TNT and the game crashes <br/>
occassionally.  If there aren&#39;t new TNT drivers soon I will probably be <br/>
switching back to Win98.<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve heard the TNT2 and the GEForce cards are supposed to have <br/>
pretty good win2k drivers.  Voodoo cards are supposed to just bite.<br/>
<br/>
Personally If I had Win98 I would wait until more reliable drivers are put <br/>
out.  It&#39;s not worth the hassle unless you have to use Win2k for some other <br/>
application.<br/>

&gt;What video card(s) are you using?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have Win2K and EQ on a test machine with an ATI Rage 3d AGP 2X GT-CZUZ <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;the display is 99% unplayable (constant, very bad,  flickering.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Did you have to do anything to get Direct X 7a installed?<br/>
