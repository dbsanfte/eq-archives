<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-446267528">But in this case there were two bards in the party. I was only 30th level so<br/>
I played hymn all the time after combat.  32+ bard played mana song all the<br/>
time after combat. If lute doesn&#39;t increase mana regen with 32d song, there<br/>
wasn&#39;t any reason for the 32+ bard to equip it except for esoteric reasons.<br/>

32 bard  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; Prior to 32d level, whenever I grouped with a 32+ bard they usually had<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lute equipped when playing the mana song after combat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I almost always intersperse one pulse of hymn for every two of clarity,<br/>
&gt; and have never received complaint about the mana coming more slowly for <br/>
&gt; doing so.<br/>
