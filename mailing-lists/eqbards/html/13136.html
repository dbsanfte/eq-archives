<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433325073">i checked last night, wondering what i could change.  all i could think of<br/>
was removing my plat fire emerald rings and getting 2 jagged bands, effect<br/>
-4str, -10dex, +10AC (more overall from modifier).  not sure if i wanna do<br/>
that.  i may go with 1 jagged band and 1 7cha/5dex ring.  my CHA is very<br/>
low, but then i lose 7str.  what i really want is a runed lava pendant, but<br/>
i can not afford one nor do i really want to camp it.  anyone know what they<br/>
go for?<br/>

P.S. Harm the Tranix crown is definitely NOT (caps just for you) no drop.<br/>
the only things no drop on FGs are mithril torque and mask and skarlon<br/>
sword.  did that cleric loot one of those?<br/>

&gt;   It&#39;s funny that you mention that, I&#39;m going to cut my dex/cha down<br/>
&gt;   and go with more str/ac too.  hehe.<br/>
