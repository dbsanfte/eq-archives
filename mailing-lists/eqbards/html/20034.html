Hiyas!  I&#39;ve been spending extensive time here with my cleric of late <br/>
so maybe I can help out.  One group is fine if you aren&#39;t fighting <br/>
reavers.  Two groups 52 - 55 can do the top reaver, I saw 40+ level <br/>
45-60 players get cleaned up by the lower one Sunday.  Apparantly a <br/>
nasty AoE that took down 15 or so players in each cast.  Reavers are <br/>
melee only so bring plenty of tanks and clerics.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forget it, they see through everything except rogue sneak/hide.  The <br/>
spawn time is slow enough (17 mins?) that you can clear out and area, <br/>
move camp up, rinse, repeat until you get where you are going.  <br/>
Outdoor zone, so trains can get rough as SoW&#39;d players try and run<br/>
for <br/>
the zone to get out of trouble, set up off the tracks.<br/>
