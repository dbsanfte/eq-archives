<div id="ygrps-yiv-747947470">I took some time to test the effect of Binding (L20) and Chain<br/>
(L23) on attack speed.  It was only a low level mob (fire<br/>
beetle), so maybe results will vary with higher level mobs.<br/>
But with my level 24 bard:<br/>
<br/>
No song: 5 attacks in 15.0 seconds = 3.0 sec/attack<br/>
Binding: 5 attacks in 18.4 seconds = 3.7 sec/attack<br/>
Chain:   5 attacks in 18.4 seconds = 3.7 sec/attack<br/>
<br/>
I timed each 2-3 times so it should be fairly accurate.  Both<br/>
Binding and Chain slow down attack speed, both apparently by<br/>
the same amount - about 23% at level 24.  It could be<br/>
different for different mobs, I just gave up trying to time it<br/>
after all the spellcasters nearby kept nuking the orcs and<br/>
goblins I was trying this on.  :-)<br/>
