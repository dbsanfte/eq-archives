<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110183966">don&#39;t know about best weapon.  depends on where your stats are i guess.  if<br/>
you have high dex maybe piercing is better, if you have high strength then<br/>
1h slashing is best.  it is always good to have your 1h slashing, 1h blunt,<br/>
and piercing maxed cause you never know when that cool weapon will come<br/>
along (i.e. fanged skull stiletto, which i heard about and am maxxing my<br/>
piercing for, and the staff of writhing, which i am maxxing my 1h blunt<br/>
for).<br/>
<br/>
btw tracking is not capped at 1 or 40, mine is 90 now and seems to keep<br/>
going up.<br/>

Yes, most bard skills are capped at 40. I did not know about h2h(damm<br/>
wanted to train in that too), but 2handers are capped at 1, tracking at<br/>
1, forage at 40, pick lock at 40, hide at 40, sneak at 40, disarm traps<br/>
at 40. Safe fall, instill doubt, and bind wound are probably too. Corect<br/>
me if I&#39;m wrong. The only thing we aren&#39;t capped in are the basic weapon<br/>
skills(cept mentioned), instrument and singing skills, dual wield,<br/>
offense and defense, (though it seems to be 5 pts behind your level,<br/>
I&#39;ve been at 90 forever at level 18), and language skills. Its the price<br/>
of being a bard heh. About best weapon...I personally used a dwarven axe<br/>
from 5 to well...using it now. Its got a nice 6 dam 26 delay. Very good<br/>
weapon, plus has same time between attacks as my polished granite<br/>
tomhawk, which is helpful in seeing when dual wield fails.<br/>

&gt; I level 12 HEF - skill level is &quot;bad&quot;, guildmaster(s) says &quot;trained to the<br/>
&gt; max limit&quot; - does that mean that hand to hand skill caps at 40? Or is it<br/>
&gt; graduated level cap, where at higher levels the cap will rise unlike the<br/>
