&gt;Well, this debate has certainly heated things up.  Its clear there is an<br/>
&gt;easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sort of taken aback that if I, personally, think bards should wear plate,<br/>
I&#39;m not a roleplayer.  Where does all this imagery of a bard not wearing<br/>
plate come from, anyway???  I&#39;ve always loved bards in literature and games,<br/>
bards are fighters and mages and rogues as well.  What defines a fighter,<br/>
besides fighting?  That shinning armor!  Bard takes a little from every<br/>
class, and when the early bards saw the men climb into their platemail, they<br/>
did too!  Without plate, bards would be more ranger-mage-rogue, completely<br/>
unacceptable.  Bards aren&#39;t great fighters, lack all the warrior training...<br/>
instead bards go for looks!  And how is that not in character when I<br/>
roleplay!  That&#39;s the one thing that likely differentiates a bard from any<br/>
other--their obsession with their charm and looks, wear the great looking<br/>
plate, yes!<br/>
<br/>
History lesson: Plate armor did not become feasible until the invention of<br/>
the stirrup, and had been invented long before.  Anyone who wore plate mail<br/>
required the employ of a squire to assit them in getting dressed, getting on<br/>
and off their horse, eating, crapping, breathing.  Guys were not in full<br/>
platemail running down a beach being chased by alligators.  Ok?  In this<br/>
game, platemail is not like it was in our history, it is much lighter and<br/>
thinner, and allows great flexibility.  I can play a guitar in a kevlar<br/>
vest, and that&#39;s probably what EQ&#39;s steel plate is like.<br/>
<br/>
I think the same people who complain about us wearing platemail are the same<br/>
people who don&#39;t like twisting or juggling.  Twisting is inherent to our<br/>
design, we are -meant- to twist.  Why else can I not twist anthem and that<br/>
earlier buff tune?  When some tunes cannot be twsited, and others can, I<br/>
come to the conclusion there is design involved.  Every class has a skill or<br/>
something to keep them busy while in autocombat.  You are NOT meant to hit<br/>
autocombat, start a tune, and sit back in your La-Z-Boy watching the<br/>
monitor.  Worse yet, you are NOT meant to stand behind all the melee action,<br/>
lute in hand, playing one song and eating popcorn and guzzling soda.<br/>
Fighters have bashes and kicks, bards have song twisting.  If you<br/>
are not twisting, you are a poor bard--for our songs are weak but having<br/>
several going at once makes up for it.  I have no problem with singing a<br/>
chorus of an anthem and then whistling and letting loose a great bellow,<br/>
singing the next chorus.  It becomes a symphony I create.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t like plate, ask yourself why this was given to us?  Then remove<br/>
plate and give us a strength that will make up for it.  Entirely rewriting<br/>
the AI code is not feasible, either.  Doing that would be wrong, regardless,<br/>
otherwise mobs would end up never targetting spellcasters.<br/>
