&gt; One of the game designers (Ryan Palacios) casually<br/>
&gt; mentioned the algorithm for determining whether you can<br/>
&gt; group with people to me once, but foolishly, I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; write all of it down.  I do remember the meat of it, which<br/>
&gt; is that the distance that people can be apart is one<br/>
&gt; quarter the levels of the highest level person in the<br/>
&gt; party.  So a level 40 person and a level 31 person could<br/>
&gt; group and both get experience.  There were a number of<br/>
&gt; exceptions involved as well, but I dont&#39; remember them :(<br/>
&gt; I believe there is a lower limit of 3, which makes sense.  <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, too many people seem to think that this is<br/>
&gt; the UPPER limit as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By definition, the upper limit has to be the same as the lower<br/>
limit, since a L40 grouping with a L31 (-9 levels) is also a<br/>
L31 grouping with a L40 (+9 levels).<br/>

J.M. Capozzi posted a message this Saturday on how experience<br/>
gain works, which made a lot of sense to me (it &quot;solves&quot; one<br/>
of my dislikes I&#39;ve always had with level-based RPGs).  In a<br/>
group, the experience you get is basically proportional to<br/>
your total experience, relative to other members of your<br/>
group.  e.g. if the bard has 10,000 e.p.s and the warrior has<br/>
5,000 e.p.s, the bard will get twice as much experience as the<br/>
warrior.  What makes this work is that the bard&#39;s level<br/>
advancement scale is steeper, so in terms of bubbles of<br/>
experience (% to next level) both gain the same amount<br/>
assuming they are both similar in numerical level.<br/>
<br/>
The grouping limitations are hard-coded on top of this to<br/>
prevent someone with too few exp from benefiting by grouping<br/>
with someone with a lot of exp.  I dunno if this is based on<br/>
numerical level or total exp, but if I were coding the game,<br/>
I&#39;d do it on total exp with a conversion factor to offset<br/>
race/class penalties.  So a L10 bard would have 10x the exp of<br/>
a L1 bard and they couldn&#39;t group, but a L40 bard would have<br/>
something like 2x the exp of a L31 bard, and they could group.<br/>
(These numbers are not accurate, they are made up to<br/>
demonstrate how a sliding grouping level restriction arises<br/>
naturally out of this type of scheme.)<br/>
