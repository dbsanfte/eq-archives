You&#39;ll have to forgive me.  It&#39;s been a *painfully* slow Friday.  I got<br/>
level 29 last night after a wonderful few hours in Mistmoore and I&#39;m itching<br/>
to go back and make sure it wasn&#39;t a fluke. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Bringing this back OnT, I was, if you&#39;ll pardon the self pat on the back,<br/>
absolutely rocking last night doing crowd control.  Our Warrior pulled six<br/>
initiates/pledges, two of which were casters.  I hurriedly let the group<br/>
(&#39;group&#39; hah!  Me, the warrior and a mage) know what I was doing: charmed<br/>
one caster and sic her on the other and kept the three male initiates<br/>
mezzed.<br/>
<br/>
Not one resist the whole time.  I took a bit of a beating as I mis-timed<br/>
some of the wake-ups, but overall I was very happy.  Which leads me to my<br/>
question... at 28/29, Pixie Strike has been working very well.  At what<br/>
point does it start to degenerate into the realms of uselessness, or is it a<br/>
gradual thing?<br/>
<br/>
Back OT: The weekend&#39;s looking pretty good now... just got offered tickets<br/>
for the first US F1 Grand Prix in Indianapolis!</div>
