<div id="ygrps-yiv-916276356">I trained disarm traps.  Ignoring for the moment that there <br/>
are no traps in the game to disarm, does anyone know how we&#39;re<br/>
supposed to disarm traps when we don&#39;t get locate traps?<br/>
Relying on a rogue to locate the traps for you is pointless<br/>
since he&#39;ll be better at disarming them.  And finding traps by<br/>
triggering them is also pointless since once they&#39;re triggered<br/>
they don&#39;t need to be disarmed (unless of course they&#39;re<br/>
designed to be continuous, which would seem to make locate<br/>
traps useless).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been using instll doubt and actually had it work a couple<br/>
times.  Last night, while I was invisible, I used instill<br/>
doubt on a dark elf seargant in Nektulos.  He gave the<br/>
standard wood-elves-must-die cry, then said he was hit by 1<br/>
point of non-melee damage, followed immediately by a message<br/>
saying I&#39;d kicked him.  Then he ran away (due to the skill <br/>
working).  Huh?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing around with beg as well.  Apparently you can<br/>
beg from monsters and mage pets, but not ships and PCs.  I<br/>
tried begging from a merchant and a guard in East Commonlands.<br/>
In both cases, they immediately killed a wandering monster<br/>
nearby.  It might&#39;ve been coincidence, but I have to wonder.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen guards kill players for begging from them before, so<br/>
I was expecting them to attack me.<br/>
<br/>
Sneak...  I&#39;ve heard rogues say they use sneak to make<br/>
merchants indifferent to them.  I can do the same thing with<br/>
hide, but haven&#39;t been able to do it with sneak, even when I<br/>
sneak successfully (move like a glacier).  I&#39;ll have to test<br/>
it by trying to sneak past some mobs.  I suppose it&#39;s possible<br/>
the skill is broken for non-rogues.<br/>
<br/>
I hit 35 this weekend.  By my timings, 34 with a mistmoore<br/>
drum is just short of running twice as fast as normal, 35 with<br/>
a mistmoore drum is just a hair faster than twice as fast. <br/>
I&#39;m getting quite a few /tells from younger bards and druids<br/>
and shamen asking how the h*ll I run so fast.  :-)  One<br/>
downside is that I&#39;m taking damage again from falls while<br/>
running over rough terrain.  Perhaps we should add to whatever<br/>
petition is going around to have our cap on safe fall increase<br/>
by one point per level or so?  Or they could just increase the<br/>
gravitational constant of the universe so that we stick closer<br/>
to the ground *snicker*...<br/>
