&gt; What would you expect a fish to carry? I agree<br/>

given the name.  The frogloks in Upper Guk of about the same<br/>
level drop research components, mesh, fine steel, and several<br/>
gold to 4pp.  The named ones of same or lower level drop lots<br/>
of nice things like Ghoulbane, the shimmering orb, elf hide<br/>
gloves, etc.  Is it too much to ask that a named, rare, high<br/>
level, wandering mob have loot similar to named, rare,<br/>
comparable level, campable mobs; for the benefit of those of<br/>
us who don&#39;t camp?  Must we camp in order to get anything<br/>
decent?<br/>
