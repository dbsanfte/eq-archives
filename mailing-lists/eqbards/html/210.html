<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070035249">Why don&#39;t you enlighten all us poor dunces<br/>
with your incredible deductive prowess?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what, you don&#39;t have the time?<br/>
<br/>
You would prefer to passively benefit only<br/>
from the most exacting research of others,<br/>
and not their guesstimates? Personally I follow<br/>
the big grain of salt rule for almost anything<br/>
that comes across my cable modem.<br/>
<br/>
My preliminary deduction is that you are selfish<br/>
and arrogant.<br/>

&gt; I could spend hours trying to correct a lot of misinformation being posted<br/>
&gt; by some people. I would ask that if you aren&#39;t 100% sure about the<br/>
&gt; information you give, don&#39;t post it as a statement, rather ask it as a<br/>
&gt; question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It reveals to me there&#39;s a lot of poor deductive logic going on with some<br/>
&gt; players - drawing conclusions from game experiences that are more based on<br/>
&gt; coincidence than on good research.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>
&gt; going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>
&gt; truth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a big difference between:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ---- &quot;Hill Giants can outrun Selo&#39;s&quot;<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; ---- &quot;A Hill Giant seemed to outrun my Selo&#39;s, has anyone else seen this?&quot;<br/>
&gt; The complicated thing is that one MAY have tested this fully, and<br/>
&gt; thus could<br/>
&gt; say:<br/>
&gt; ---- &quot;I tried running 10 times from a Hill Giant and here are the<br/>
&gt; results....&quot;<br/>
