&gt;Bard invis works really great in Unrest and Mistmoore vs. undead and<br/>
&gt;living (although Mistmoore is a strange case, certain monsters are<br/>
&gt;affected by Undead spells, but Camo can move by them, hmm) but as<br/>
&gt;Benjamin said it no longer works in Lower Guk on Undead.<br/>
&gt;Another weird thing is that bard invis doesn&#39;t work on greater Kobolds<br/>
&gt;in Solusek B (35+ dungeon basically) but you can go all the way to the<br/>
&gt;frogluk king on Live side Lower Guk with it, and unless a shaman froggie<br/>
&gt;has see invis on you are fine. You can actually stand there admiring the<br/>
&gt;bok&#39;s and frog king (although I&#39;d recommend being careful, in case it<br/>
&gt;blinked ;)). If I&#39;m not mistaken (and I could be), our invis used to<br/>
&gt;work against Undead in Lower Guk Undead side, and was changed in a patch<br/>
&gt;a few months ago. This was even before they fixed Selo&#39;s overwriting<br/>
&gt;Spirit of Wolf.<br/>
