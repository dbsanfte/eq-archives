<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572810944">- Songweaver&#39;s spiritual charge (possible)<br/>
Effect: Group regains lost HP and their status ailments are cured and <br/>
dispelled.<br/>
Type: singing<br/>
Comment:I hate having to ask for a poison/blood boil/disease cure after each <br/>
fight.<br/>
<br/>
- Lyssa&#39;s Undying Love. (possible)<br/>
Effect: Complete heal/Complete clarity(mana full) entire group at the <br/>
expense of death touching yourself.<br/>
Type: singing<br/>
Comment:Vox is down to the L in her name and only a couple of people are <br/>
still alive? Sacrifice your life for the good of the group.  Harsh penalty <br/>
to avoid abuse, no exp resurrection allowed.<br/>
<br/>
- Psalm of Possession (probably not)<br/>
Effect:  Slight chance during battle with a casting mob, that you get hit by <br/>
a spell in their repertoire, then you &quot;learn&quot; it for the remainder of that <br/>
mob&#39;s life.<br/>
Effect: Wind<br/>
<br/>
Comment:Solusek Kobold Shaman casts Togor&#39;s on you! &quot;You feel more <br/>
knowledgeable!&quot; (now psalm spell temporarily changes to togor&#39;s) as long as <br/>
the mob stays alive, you gain this ability.  can never have more than one <br/>
new acquired spell. plus it has a high resistance rate.  if you learn a new <br/>
spell, it replaces the last last spell.<br/>
<br/>
- Veeshan&#39;s Rage (perhaps if tuned)<br/>
Self Effect: Only Useable with full mana. casted like a temporary spell <br/>
buff, like speed of cheetah. Enter into &#39;beserked state&#39; as mana bar <br/>
decreases X per song pulse.  Any song Played during this time is enhanced X <br/>
2.  Also all stats/resistances are effectively doubled (cap at 255 still), <br/>
HP/STM/ATTK/DEF all x 2.<br/>
<br/>
Comment: Maybe an effect like ressurrection effects is placed upon you when <br/>
this spell buff wears off.<br/>
<br/>
- Tuyen&#39;s Song of Chance (possible)<br/>
Effect: Any random buff from all classes (including bard) gets cast upon <br/>
entire group for duration of 3 pulses.<br/>
<br/>
Comment: Talk about jack of all trades.  we have the random ability to cast <br/>
a lvl 4 shaman buff to a lvl 60 wizard&#39;s shieldskin, but only for 3 pulses <br/>
long.  then its another random chance.  heh.  i think itd be funny just to <br/>
see, sort of like the mini teleport we got now.<br/>
<br/>
- Tune of Telepathy (possible)<br/>
Effect: Target gives health report. Possible alternative, get <br/>
Lvl/Hp/Mp/Weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Comment: &#39;A weed snake says &quot;Hit by non-melee damage, I have 32 of 75 hps.&#39;  <br/>
Useless perhaps, but may be worth something someday.  Should be able to code <br/>
easily, seeing as how ShowEq does this now.<br/>
<br/>
- Veeshan&#39;s Lyric (possible)<br/>
Effect: Temporary invulnerability. Similiar to that of Cleric&#39;s Divine <br/>
barrier.<br/>
<br/>
Comment: Cost a bubble of mana per cast.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More to come later as i brainstorm.<br/>
