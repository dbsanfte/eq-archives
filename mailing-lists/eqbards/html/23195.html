&gt;kiting is a completely safe tactic.  A good example is by the giant fort in<br/>
&gt;Burning Woods.  If you pull a giant to either side of the ramp, snare it and<br/>
&gt;then start fearing it, it will just run back and forth while everyone whoops<br/>
&gt;up on it.  Now if fear breaks then the giant will of course start attacking<br/>
&gt;you.  I have never fear kited in the Overthere location referenced earlier<br/>
&gt;but if the mob still attacks you when fear breaks or is resisted, then why<br/>
&gt;would using fear kiting in this location be considered an exploit when it<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t in other locations?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the exploit part is when you can get something &#39;&#39;stuck&#39;&#39; on a feature of the landscape<br/>
like a rock or a corner or something like that so that you don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
adds.  if the giant is actually getting stuck on the ramp, i&#39;d say that would<br/>
be an exploit too.</div>
