<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120623721">Crier,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for your plug of CZ. I am about sick of camping<br/>
Highpass Keep, and as looking for some yummier spots. (ie non boring)<br/>
<br/>
I am attaching a post I sent to EQ-Baking... This will explain to everyone<br/>
how to get good baking skills with minimum cost.<br/>
<br/>
Baking seems to be the only skill I could afford to get to master, due to<br/>
its relativly low cost and VERY nice profit margin once you get a high<br/>
skill. (As a Bard, 75 INT does not lend itself to learning skills)<br/>
<br/>
Be sure and read the PS of my post below to learn to power bake yourself<br/>
to 135.<br/>
<br/>

Once again, I&#39;ll rant about the benefits of fish fillets!! <br/>
<br/>
Here is the profit for fish fillets : (This is for the benefit of everone)<br/>
<br/>
1 Fresh Fish (26 Copper) + 1 Jug of Sauce (10 Copper) <br/>
                        = 2 Cakes that sell for 58 copper each<br/>
<br/>
        Hence 36 copper becomes 116. Thats MORE THAN TRIPLE.<br/>
        (Barring no failures)<br/>
<br/>
Net result ? Backpack full of fish and backpack full of sauce <br/>
yield 12.8pp when done, without failures.<br/>
<br/>
Do 2 sets of these, and you will prolly have paid for all the <br/>
fish/batwings it took to get you to 120+ (see PS below) there<br/>
is NO other skill out there that can recover your inital investment<br/>
this quickly, AND have a great profit base for the forseeable future.<br/>
<br/>
(Point of reference, an enchanter friend of mine went to 135 in 2 hours,<br/>
recovered all his investment, and was making a profit in 3).<br/>
And get this... YOU CAN DO IT WHILE MEDDING! (Yes! that means<br/>
all you finger wiggling bookworms can make money while you med!)<br/>
<br/>
The other nice thing is that I was able to AFFORD to get my <br/>
baking skill to 135 with a 75 INT. (Bards dont need INT)<br/>
<br/>
Remember : The above is with 111 CHA and Aimiable faction.<br/>
(Bards can &#39;faction bend themselves, and CHA is a primary <br/>
 bard stat)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

Master Baker (135), Just need to get some darn snake eggs to make pies<br/>
<br/>
PS. Quick Recipie for &#39;power bakers&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Goto E. Freeport, buy 2 backpacks of fish at the docks. <br/>
Goto W. Freeport, buy 2 backpacks of batwings at the Arcane Shop<br/>
        (Magician Shop, 2nd floor, first woman on right)<br/>
Make Fish Rolls, Welcome to Everclick!<br/>
<br/>
Wash. Rinse. Repeat.<br/>
<br/>
(Fish Rolls triv out at 135, you are getting to about 120<br/>
 to make the fillets (which triv out out 85) fail less)<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW the above is not profitable, just easy, since the zones are <br/>
right next to each other and you can do all this quickly.<br/>
