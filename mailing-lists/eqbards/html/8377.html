&gt; 		AH!  Minkin! What blasphemy!  Well, sometime you&#39;ll have to<br/>
&gt; meet Halana, she is a very kind Shaman I assure you. :-)  I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; level you are, but she is 31 now, so if you&#39;d ever like to fight together<br/>
&gt; give me a tell.  Course she&#39;s going to be camping rubi for the next couple<br/>
&gt; days in a desperate attempt to get some hot red pants while they can still<br/>
&gt; be had.<br/>

&gt; 				i&#39;ve found that most of the attitude problem<br/>
&gt; players are either wizards or<br/>
&gt; 				druids.... being kill stealers or/and<br/>
&gt; kiters.  And my personnal favorite top<br/>
&gt; 				hated is Barbarian shamans, i&#39;ve only met<br/>
&gt; one nice one of them so far.  And<br/>
&gt; 				i agree,  when i had my newbie troll i found<br/>
&gt; that most of the trolls and<br/>
&gt; 				ogres i met were very friendly, then again,<br/>
&gt; most newbies are as they havent<br/>
&gt; 				been exposed to kill stealing dungeons yet<br/>
&gt; where they lose their innocence. <br/>

&gt; 				&gt; &gt;OK time for a new wrinkle on the stalker<br/>
&gt; issue, have any of you who play <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; &gt;female characters noticed a trend in the<br/>
&gt; race of the stalkers?<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; Can&#39;t say as I&#39;ve ever had much of a<br/>
&gt; problem with stalkers.  Had one high <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; elf try it once with my wood elf druid.  I<br/>
&gt; sent him a tell that if he<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; didnt <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; stop it ASAP, i would /report him.  He<br/>
&gt; apologized quickly and never I<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; heard <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; from him again.  I am female in RL, btw.<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; Never had the problem on my wood elf bard<br/>
&gt; from strangers.  Get lots of <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; teasing from flirting from the male<br/>
&gt; members of my guild.  But since I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; known most of them for 3 RL years, its not<br/>
&gt; quite the same thing.<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; One thing I have noticed: for some reason,<br/>
&gt; seems like more wood elves and <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; high elves have attitude problems than the<br/>
&gt; other races.  Wood elf male<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; bards <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; being the worst. Of course, this is a<br/>
&gt; subjective opinion.  One thing for <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; sure though, soon as my wood elf<br/>
&gt; characters were old enough to travel, I <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; left Fedwyr and rarely go back.<br/>
&gt; 				&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; As for Trolls and Ogres, I&#39;ve found them<br/>
&gt; to be some of the nicest folks <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; you&#39;d want to be around, so long as you<br/>
&gt; can overlook their disgusting <br/>
&gt; 				&gt; personal habits ;-P<br/>
