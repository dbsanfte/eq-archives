&gt; suspect having one tank (someone with parry and riposte) per<br/>
&gt; extra giant would save the clerics a lot of mana.  Another<br/>
&gt; option may be rooting the extras some distance away (assuming<br/>
&gt; they can be rooted).<br/>

  I can tank an ice giant on my own with one shaman healing<br/>
  me if it is drowsied.  I&#39;m not sure rooting the giant will<br/>
  help because of duration issues.  Then again, I&#39;ve never <br/>
  seen anyone root a L45+ giant.<br/>
