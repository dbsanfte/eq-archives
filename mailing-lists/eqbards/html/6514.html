&lt;Crier stares into the distance imagining what it would be like to have a<br/>
group listen to her advice.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It would be so nice if a group I was in would listen to me when I tell them<br/>
things like this.  Maybe I&#39;m just not tactful enough (although I genuinely try<br/>
to be), but when I get into a group of 5 or 6 people there&#39;s always at least<br/>
one guy (and usually more) who just doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;, or says &quot;Who made you<br/>
God?&quot; when I try and tell them that I can control the fight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry for the cursing, but this sort of advice is generally greeted with a<br/>
&quot;Fuck you.  Check this bossy bard out...  Don&#39;t tell me how to play my<br/>
character.&quot;, usually from a warrior or a necromancer (often Dark Elves for<br/>
some reason).  I implore my group to let me lullaby mobs and yet they continue<br/>
to, fight after fight, attack multiples.  Even if I stand there and lull,<br/>
lull, lull shouting &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot; they<br/>
just won&#39;t do it.  This isn&#39;t just one group, it&#39;s probably 8 out of 10. It&#39;s<br/>
discouraging.<br/>
<br/>
Part of my problem might be that I play on Fennin Ro.  That server is almost<br/>
ALWAYS at the bottom of the list when sorted by number of players.  Usually<br/>
1,700 or 1,800, even on a weeknight.  Weekends, forget it.  I&#39;ve seen Fennin<br/>
Ro hit 1,900.  Them&#39;s some crowded zones.  Playing EQ on Fennin Ro is<br/>
oftentimes like playing Quake.  Four groups camp something and the instant it<br/>
spawns they&#39;re all blasting for all they&#39;re worth.  I have gotten to the point<br/>
where I refuse to play in Highpass Hold.  The people camping the Orcs are some<br/>
of the rudest, Kill Stealing-est, nastiest and most juvenile players I&#39;ve ever<br/>
encountered in any game.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s gotten to the point where I would consider abandoning my 21st level bard<br/>
on Fennin Ro and start a new bard on another server if I thought the people<br/>
were friendlier.  What do you people on the (slightly) less busy servers have<br/>
to say?  Are they any friendlier?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; After this group broke up, I joined one of the best groups I have ever<br/>
&gt; been in.  We had me, a warrior, a shadow knight, a paladin, a ranger and a<br/>
&gt; shaman all level 30-34 and we were fighting in the throne room.  I was<br/>
&gt; using Pixie Strike (my new favoirte song), Lullaby, Anthem, Hymn, Psalm of<br/>
&gt; Cooling and Constant Chain depending on the situation and we were the only<br/>
&gt; group there for a few hours.  We cleared both floors of the house and had<br/>
&gt; about a 5 minute break before things started respawning.  It was simply<br/>
&gt; amazing... We handled some insane pulls (2 heralds, 1 justicar, 1 monkey,<br/>
&gt; 1 zealot, 1 fanatic), never started a train, never died, and gained a lot<br/>
&gt; of experience (a bubble and a half of level 30 in 4 hours) and cash (100pp<br/>
&gt; after selling the 10 fine steel weapons I got).  Best of all.. i never<br/>
&gt; unequipped my lute :).<br/>
&gt; The tactics for various situations were:<br/>
&gt; 1 non-caster: twist Anthem, Hymn and Psalm of Cooling.  If the ranger<br/>
&gt; couldnt snare it, Chain it when it starts to run.<br/>
&gt; 1 caster: Pixie Strike over and over and over to interrupt the spells.<br/>
&gt; This is very effective against the shaman we were fighting as it stopped<br/>
&gt; the heals.<br/>
&gt; 2 non casters: Pixie Strike until it succeeds, then Hymn, repeat.  Keep<br/>
&gt; the mob that isnt being attacked messed and still heal everyone.. Save<br/>
&gt; that shaman mana. When one dies, switch to the 1 mob scenario<br/>
&gt; 2 casters or mixed: Lullaby over and over again.  This will interrupt the<br/>
&gt; caster(s) and keep one mob sleeped most of the time. When 1 dies, switch<br/>
&gt; to the 1 mob scenario<br/>
&gt; 3 or more: Lullaby over and over again. Most mobs are sleeping which<br/>
&gt; helps when there are multiple healers.<br/>
&gt; For these tactics to work you MUST teach everyone to /assist the puller.<br/>
&gt; It usually takes about 30 minutes to convince the meleers who arent used<br/>
&gt; to grouping with an enchanter or a bard to usually ignore the mobs who go<br/>
&gt; for the shaman or the new mob that just spawned and joined in and let me<br/>
&gt; handle it. So drill it into their heads:<br/>
&gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot; (this happened twice last night<br/>
&gt; and I couldnt mesmerize the mob off the dotter.. he learned)<br/>
&gt; and best of all when you first join the group or when someone new joins...<br/>
&gt; &quot;Hello my name is Celandro Spellsong and I will be your substitute<br/>
&gt; enchanter for the night.  Adjust your play accordingly.&quot;<br/>
