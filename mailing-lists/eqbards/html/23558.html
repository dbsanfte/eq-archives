<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600182287">Oh, I don&#39;t mean bard quests in PoG.  I mean the armor quests from dorks,<br/>
err, dorfs.  You can get the &#39;equivilant&#39; of PoG dropped armor by doing<br/>
quests for Dwarfs (or giants, perhaps dragons?) Supposedly there are<br/>
different ways of getting more or less equivalent items. Questing seems to<br/>
be much harder than hunting in PoG.  Since I posted, someone mentioned that<br/>
they worship Bristlebane so I guess it makes some sense to reward his<br/>
followers for hunting in PoG - albeit at the expense of faction loss that<br/>
may haunt (or maybe only annoy) you in other parts of the &#39;world.&#39;<br/>
