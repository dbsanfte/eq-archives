&gt; I&#39;ve confirmed with three other bards over level 30 that there is a problem<br/>
&gt; with Chains not giving any messages when used on creatures that have<br/>
&gt; previous effects cast on them. As was mentioned yesterday, any mob with SOW<br/>
&gt; on it can no longer be chained and will tear off to find help. This nearly<br/>
&gt; killed me last night in Solusek&#39;s Eye. I was healing at the clockworks<br/>
&gt; waiting for my partner when a young goblin strolled through for some reason<br/>
&gt; and attacked.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just to mention that the mob does not need to have SoW for the chain not to<br/>
work. This is how i find out.<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting for a friend, in Upper Guk, at the entrance. I Was bored, so I<br/>
attack the Froglock Guard that are there... Well my chain was not working (No<br/>
message what so ever), and there was no &quot;Shaman&quot;, and The Guard had no SoW on<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
I did kill it, and was happy to know that bug before i get killed in Lower Guk<br/>
for relying on my chain.<br/>
