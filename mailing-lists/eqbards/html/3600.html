<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030125969">I think I know exactly the room you mean.  Walked into it and saw two blue<br/>
Gaz warriors and a green sentinel the second time I went in.  It was<br/>
basically a big empty room though with only three froggies when I was there.<br/>
You do mean the room with the passage to the left that leads towards the<br/>
Squires&#39; room, right?<br/>

&gt; Trolls definitely, threatened to eat me they did!  But I went in pretty<br/>
far<br/>
&gt; and the only non-green I saw was a Shin warrior and a Gaz Shaman.  Maybe a<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, my party got wiped out at L17-19 by dangerous blue Gaz<br/>
knights and blue-white Ton warrior/knights.  Try this.  Go<br/>
over that annoying plank bridge.  It&#39;ll open up into a room<br/>
with a square well-looking thing in the middle.  On the far<br/>
right is a hallway leading down.  To the left of that is a<br/>
short passage which ends at a ledge with a plank leading down<br/>
into a large room.  Go into that room.  If you survive more<br/>
than 30 seconds, I&#39;ll believe you.  :-)  My L24 cleric friend<br/>
got lost there and was killed by a huge mob of frogs our last<br/>
Guk trip. I consider this area to be close to the middle of<br/>
Upper Guk.<br/>
<br/>
At 26, the Shin warriors and shamen, Ton knights, and some Gaz<br/>
warriors were still blue to me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And no, being a tailor and therefore generally poor, woven isn&#39;t trash<br/>
loot<br/>
&gt; to me.  Mesh is what I was really after to replace all my leather until I<br/>
&gt; get reinforced made.  Yah right, in my dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Heh heh.  When I did my mesh vs bronze test, I topped out at<br/>
26 pounds wearing mesh (vs. 68 for mostly bronze).  I would&#39;ve<br/>
loved to have stayed lightweight, but the damage I was taking<br/>
was nasty - reminded me of back when I was in my teens.<br/>
