<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586555622">my level 49 wizard friend was fighting cyndreela and she feared him into the<br/>
fear gate, by the time he got out he lost 4 bubbles of exp.  but that story<br/>
about 18 ppl (not even close to enough, 18 was about perfect for safety<br/>
before the patch) is just painful to hear<br/>
<br/>
dunno how, but can anyone explain how eq&#39;lizer had that post about the<br/>
inferno, blade of the cursed dmg 12 del 19 sword some group got off cazic<br/>
recently?  seems damn impossible to me.<br/>

&gt; &gt; All this was prenerf btw, we cant even kill one mob now in <br/>
&gt; the fear plane.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has any server even managed to kill one mob in the fear <br/>
&gt; plane since it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; nerfed?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not on Tarrew Marr. I haven&#39;t been playing lately (what&#39;s there to do<br/>
&gt; for a L49 bard?) but I dropped in on the weekend to chat with friends<br/>
&gt; and heard one particularly depressing story. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 18 people went to PoF on Tarrew last week to try to do some <br/>
&gt; adventuring.<br/>
&gt; Within 5 minutes they were all dead. It took 9 hours for some <br/>
&gt; of them to<br/>
&gt; get their bodies back. Some of them never did and have quit the game.<br/>
&gt; Others, in frustration, allowed themselves to die until they were<br/>
&gt; knocked back to L45, at which time they were able to get their bodies<br/>
&gt; retrieved for them by a GM as they were unable to enter the <br/>
&gt; PoF anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of the 20+ people I used to adventure with regularly on Tarrew Marr, 3<br/>
&gt; were logged in on Saturday as their L50 characters. The rest may have<br/>
&gt; been on as alternates, though the ones I know the names of definately<br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t. Of the Bard&#39;s I know on the server, several have <br/>
&gt; left the game<br/>
&gt; at L48-49 without even bothering to get 50.<br/>
