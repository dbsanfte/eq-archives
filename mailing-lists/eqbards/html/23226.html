<div id="ygrps-yiv-960881264">From the entrance (closest to Thurgadin) go right, right, left (at the junctions).  It&#39;s a large cave with 4 crystallines, and sometimes a matriarch (she spawns between the back two mobs, and has a long spawn rate).  Since the wurms spawn on the edges of the room, we just cycle through them (start on right, and go counter-clockwise).  The middle of the room is safe, so you can pull there.  If you look at the map at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/greatdividemap.html">http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/greatdividemap.html</a> the cave I&#39;m talking about is the largest one on the map (approx /loc neg4400, neg1100).  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, we&#39;ve been hunting here with some level 54s, and the wurms are still blue to them.<br/>
<br/>
On the rarity....we cleaned the room once last night cause the Matriarch was up....a normal wurm dropped 1 spell, and Matty dropped 3 spells (Ms2, Spirit Quickening, and Melody of Ervaj).  On any given night, we&#39;ll kill in the room for up to 4 hours (it can be boring), and see between 3 and 7 spells drop.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you are on Tarew Marr, and are interested in buying Melody of Ervaj, I think our cleric or shaman have copies....give me a tell tonight and I&#39;ll find out for ya.<br/>

I have camped Guardian Shardwurms in GD and seen the Broodmother.  I have<br/>
not seen Crystaline Shardwurms or the Matriarch.  Are we talking the same<br/>
wurms or are the ones you speak of farther in the wurm cave?  The spot I<br/>
camped is: head in cave, take first left and guardians/broodmother are in a<br/>
cave on the left.  Please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
