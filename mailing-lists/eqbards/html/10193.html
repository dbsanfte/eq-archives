&gt; Being a newly 32nd bard I&#39;m getting hit with various questions and claims<br/>

time.  L32 bard Clarity was about a 33% reduction in med<br/>
time.  L40 bard Clarity was about a 38% reduction in med<br/>
time.  These figures are probably +/- 3% or so due to<br/>
inaccuracies in eyeballing the mana bar, but it really seems<br/>
like a straight level% conversion.<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to time the spells/songs stacking, but I have yet<br/>
to see any anecdotal claims that they *don&#39;t* stack.  All the<br/>
anecdotes I&#39;ve seen people give say one enchanter Clarity plus<br/>
as many bard clarities as you like will all stack.<br/>
