&gt;I&#39;ll take your word for it.  My friend who has a 35th monk on Sol Ro is<br/>
&gt;always complaining the warrior with the executioner axe is outdamaging him.<br/>
&gt;At 18th level in our group the warrior dual wielding Langseaxe and I forget<br/>
&gt;what sure seems to outdamage our monk.  Maybe it gets better later on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This could very possibly be true since the Executioner&#39;s Axe procs haste. <br/>
Give the monk a flowing black silk sash or a swirlspine belt and I suspect <br/>
those results would change.<br/>
