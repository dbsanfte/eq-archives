<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075362701"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Speaking of which, who all enjoys playing<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love my Bard for this reason. At level 17 now,<br/>
I can honestly say that I&#39;ve been to more zones<br/>
than anyone else that I&#39;ve played with. I do wish<br/>
we had some sort of gate (other than dying) as<br/>
it&#39;s really nice to be able to get to the other<br/>
side of the world fast.. but it&#39;d be nice to be<br/>
able to just *poof* our way home. But I can&#39;t<br/>
complain much.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The freedom to explore that REALLY<br/>
&gt; dangerous place, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly. I&#39;m level 17 as I said, and I *know*<br/>
that I shouldn&#39;t be looking to visit the place<br/>
in the water around Oasis, but I&#39;m going to. I<br/>
*know* I shouldn&#39;t even go look at Kedge Keep,<br/>
but I&#39;m going to (try). And I *know* I shouldn&#39;t<br/>
even think about entering either Permafrost Keep,<br/>
Najena or Cazic-Thule - but I have plans on making<br/>
suicide &quot;speed runs&quot;, just to see what they<br/>
look like inside. Will I die? Oh, I&#39;m sure I<br/>
will. But I&#39;ll make it farther in before I do<br/>
than another class at my level. =)<br/>
<br/>
I love to see new places, and at this level I<br/>
really don&#39;t know where to go - so I&#39;m exploring<br/>
for curiosity sake - and because I&#39;m a Bard. I can.</div>
