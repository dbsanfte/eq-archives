<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198131167"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Chances are the bard is one of the above examples instead, and won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;be very helpful in the group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find any of those Bards here.  I&#39;m of the opinion that<br/>
this list is one of the last bastions of the serious Bard on the net.  Even<br/>
the Concert Hall is slipping into the depths of whinedom.<br/>
<br/>
All of us here know the differences between a good and bad Bard.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mean to sound uncaring of your predicament, but you&#39;re preaching to the<br/>
converted.  Your attitude to Bards is typical of many people who have<br/>
suffered at the hands of a few bad apples.  Since you&#39;ve already gotten to<br/>
level 50 yourself, why not invite one of those Bards you so frequently pass<br/>
up and offer to teach them a few tricks of the trade?  No-one likes to be<br/>
told that they&#39;re doing wrong, but if you offer ways to improve their<br/>
techniques, making the group more efficient, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a much<br/>
better time of it.</div>
