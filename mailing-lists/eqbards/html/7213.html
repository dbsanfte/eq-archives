<div id="ygrps-yiv-626924424">Your points are interesting but not valid as far as the other spell cassting<br/>
hybrids go.  Both druids and clerics can also use the shiny brass shield so<br/>
we gain nothing over them there.  <br/>
<br/>
Also the dirk and whip are by no means as good as a glowing crook staff.<br/>
the dirk is 6/23 which works out to a ratio of .565 using max damage of 13,<br/>
the &#39;Glower&#39; as I hear called frequently is 11/35 which means a hefty ratio<br/>
of .657, very painful.  The BLW is even worse than a dirk at 7/28 which<br/>
works out to a ratio of only .536 using max damage.  A full point of better<br/>
ratio is pretty devastating in a one-on-one fight.<br/>
<br/>
You kited beetles 6 levels higher than you using bellow?  I hate to be rude<br/>
but I do not believe you.  Not only would it take forever at the 7 pts a<br/>
bellow you would have been doing, but the resists would have been frequent.<br/>
Past that they should have been not &#39;too frequent&#39; but nearly 100%!  Not to<br/>
mention that running into anything else would have made 1 or 2 stuns fatal.<br/>
