<div id="ygrps-yiv-58605116">You&#39;re right.  We can&#39;t really complain that they&#39;ve finally given us a song<br/>
they had &quot;no plans for at present&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard people say the angel voice and subsequent message spam gets<br/>
really annoying in short order.  In a full group, you&#39;re going to get 6<br/>
messages saying &quot;blahblah&#39;s skin is surrounded by a shield of songs&quot; or<br/>
something similar.  Hopefully Verant will remove the message that everyone<br/>
else sees when the song takes effect.<br/>
<br/>
Now a question on the mechanics of the song: since it provides a 45pt rune,<br/>
if a mob hits you for, say, 50pts, then that additional 5 points is also<br/>
absorbed?  There&#39;s obviously more useful songs to twist than this alone?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;ll find out myself in 11 levels.<br/>

useful song.  So what if it only absorbs 45 dmg or so?  It&#39;s cheap,<br/>
group-wide, refreshes when it pulses, has cool particle effects, makes you<br/>
sound like a choir of angels (ok, so maybe that&#39;s a drawback), and it<br/>
requires NO reagents that I have noticed.  Plus it&#39;s a song where we never<br/>
had one before... hehe<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
