all-tanks, giving the entire group Quickness represents only<br/>
400 mana, or about a bubble.  They can med that back in a<br/>
little over a minute.  Dunno how long it lasts at L50.<br/>

The reason I find it nauseating is because a group with a L49<br/>
bard can improve their performance by getting a L16 enchanter<br/>
to buff them.<br/>
