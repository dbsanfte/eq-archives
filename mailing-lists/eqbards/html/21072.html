<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542016366">Ok this REALLY falls into the &quot;whiney player&quot; category.  If I&#39;d known this<br/>
was what you were posting about earlier I wouldn&#39;t have replied to your<br/>
message at all on whineplay.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry my friend but Duping bugs, corpse loss bugs, item poofing bugs etc<br/>
take FAR more priority, to me, than fixing a song that I have learned to do<br/>
without.  I&#39;d FAR rather not be able to mez than to lose all my hard earned<br/>
items to a corpse poofing bug.<br/>
<br/>
Complaining about reality is one thing but they HAVE had some pretty major<br/>
bugs pop up over the past couple weeks that really do take priority over<br/>
fixing things like a secondary resist on our songs.  I&#39;m not saying our<br/>
songs aren&#39;t important to me, far from it, but I really think we need to<br/>
keep things in perspective.<br/>

&gt; You can find a snip of it on www.eqvault.com in the news.<br/>
&gt; I know it was somewhere on the whineplay general forum, but with the<br/>
&gt; servers currently down I can&#39;t connect to it with all the traffic.<br/>

&gt; [Quote from original post: 4. When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes<br/>
&gt; song), chains (level 23 non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target<br/>
&gt; mes song) be fixed?]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gord&#39;o:<br/>
&gt; Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we&#39;ve had some other<br/>
&gt; things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding<br/>
&gt; chains, it&#39;s working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is<br/>
&gt; that it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m very annoyed by GZ&#39;s comments stating Ester was yanked from our<br/>
problem.<br/>
