<b>Subject:</b> Hey Harmonic, time to press that optional download again! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425847569">In case no one has tried today to use the optional patch button, give it a push!  It seems that Verant has uploaded Paineel onto the patch server.  I don&#39;t know what their plans were for this area, but I&#39;m assuming its for upper levels.  <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d give Harmonic his second reason for using the optional button! (j/k)<br/>
