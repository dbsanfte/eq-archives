Unrest, right at the zone.<br/>
Kithicor Forest, at the zone to west commons, at night (hint:  look<br/>
up to the sky and you can see the walls, and thus gauge the path)<br/>

&gt; I dont know if I was replying to you or someone else, but they made it<br/>
&gt; sound like Infra was barely better than human vision.  Thats pretty far<br/>
&gt; off.  If you have a Greater light stone and some flashing song,<br/>
&gt; obviously that helps the human vision...  Actually the darkest place I<br/>
&gt; know is the tunnel into Guk in Innothule, though I never went into the<br/>
&gt; arena tunnel with a human...  In the guk tunnel I turned my brightness<br/>
&gt; all the way up on my monitor and still could only see people&#39;s names. <br/>
&gt; Needless to say the troll there had a pretty fun time, guiding me to the<br/>
&gt; guk zone.  (&quot;Turn lef! lef!&quot;  &quot;No rit! rit!&quot;)<br/>
