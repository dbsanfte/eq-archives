 </span></blockquote>No, I was simply setting out to describe what I was seeing, trying to come<br/>
up with the likely explanation for the lack of RP in EQ (compared to UO). I<br/>
see interaction mechanics like Guildsay and the whole chatbox interface to<br/>
be &quot;pressures&quot; on RP, Not that they make it impossible /at all/, just that<br/>
in a given population of people the mechanics of interaction will tend to<br/>
result in a certain percentage of people RPing a certain percentage of the<br/>
time. In UO I believe both those percentages are larger and I am interested<br/>
in the sociology of it.<br/>
As I have spouted on the list before, I raised the largest armies (being<br/>
defined as characters in one place at one time all with generally the same<br/>
intention) ever in UO and got totally hooked on the sociology of it all,<br/>
particularly the aspect of getting people to do what you want them to given<br/>
that you have zero direct control over them, that at any point they could<br/>
turn off their computer and *poof* your influence would be gone, so, you<br/>
have to find a way to that they WANT what you want (which is the only way to<br/>
raise armies in virtual communities btw).  This was particularly put to use<br/>
in the Imperium on Siege Perilous.<br/>
So anyway, I am interested in what does and doesn&#39;t hook the greatest number<br/>
of people emotionally, and what fosters or doesn&#39;t foster the greatest<br/>
number of people being hooked. But I am not at all saying it isn&#39;t possible<br/>
to get hooked though guildsay :o)<br/>
