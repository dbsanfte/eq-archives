<div id="ygrps-yiv-205951571"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Question for all you Bards who spend a lot of time in Hate...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think my guild has now logged more hour in the &quot;new&quot; Hate, than any <br/>
&gt;other Xegony guild. While this has been good for the guild, I still <br/>
&gt;have the same old problem -- what songs to play?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pretend you are a level 54 bard, and are hunting Hate level 2 with 23 <br/>
&gt;other people. Assume all the melee has the enchanter epic haste, and <br/>
&gt;each group, generally, contains an enchanter, a cleric, 2 melee, and <br/>
&gt;two caster. (Well, your group will have one caster and a bard. <br/>
&gt;*Smiles*)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I guess Cantana is the no brainer for non combat periods.  Casters can<br/>
never have too much mana or anyone have too few hit points.  If your group<br/>
is heavy on the casters you might want to keep Cantana going during combat,<br/>
especially if pulls are back to back to back.<br/>
With all your tanks having sos and a cleric in each group during combat I<br/>
would think Niv&#39;s would probably the most preferd song.  Pure atk bonus<br/>
help more than other bonuses for the melee folks to hit more often.<br/>
With GMR in place from an enchanter there is not much reason for resist<br/>
buffs beyond that.  I haven&#39;t seen many casting mobs that posed a serious<br/>
problem from their spells.<br/>
Its more of a problem on the 1st floor, but I would shy away from ae<br/>
totally in hate and leave the mez/charm to the enchanters.  With 23 people<br/>
up there thats roughly 4 groups, if each has an enchanter there shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be a lack of croud control.  You may want to keep a mez memed for seriously<br/>
bad encounters that the enchanters can&#39;t get under control, but usually i<br/>
find that they don&#39;t like others steping on their toes.<br/>
Since bard songs can tend to adversely affect puller that has a hord on<br/>
him/her I don&#39;t usually put bards in the pull group.  If any necros are up<br/>
in hate, i would be more likely to put them in with a bard for the added<br/>
mana regen and healing regen so that they can dump mana faster to the pull<br/>
group which generally in a more mana intensive situation.<br/>
You might want to have Largo&#39;s memed in case the shamen goes down.  I<br/>
assume one is in the raid force for slowing.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.</div>
