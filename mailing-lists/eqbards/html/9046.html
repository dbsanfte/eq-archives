Upon attaining my 28th song, I decided to join the ranks of testers and<br/>
attempted to mez myself between pulls/spawns in Cazic-Thule/Highkeep.  I<br/>
only ever managed two of the results, complete resist or successful stun<br/>
(i.e. no &quot;icon up but movement possible&quot;).  I did notice one oddity.<br/>
<br/>
Target self.<br/>
Start song.<br/>
&quot;You are stunned!&quot;<br/>
&quot;You send forth music.&quot;<br/>
Mesmerized at this point.<br/>
&quot;You are unstunned.&quot;<br/>
Movement possible at this point.<br/>
&quot;You are no longer stunned.&quot;<br/>
Icon disappears.<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that either the icon isn&#39;t linked to the song effect, or one<br/>
is handled client side (effect), and one exclusively by server (icon).<br/>
