game (because you can do it with newbie characters).  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I checked the prices on a bunch of items from 2pp to 31pp and<br/>
the were all consistent.  The price on items at the low end (I<br/>
only checked 1gp and 4gp) &quot;bottom out&quot; at around 95 chr (extra<br/>
chr does not increase the discount).  And the very cheap items<br/>
(a few silver) you can sell for the same price you buy at 95+<br/>
chr.<br/>

---  -----  ----------------------<br/>
 75  1.000    -<br/>
 80  0.977  0.443%<br/>
 85  0.957  0.422%<br/>
 90  0.936  0.409%<br/>
 95  0.917  0.388%<br/>
100  0.898  0.374%<br/>
105  0.880  0.357%<br/>
110  0.863  0.343%<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The third column is basically your price savings per point of<br/>
charisma invested in the above range.  I only checked in<br/>
increments of 5 charisma, so those values are the average over<br/>
5 points.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also agree that for very expensive items, the discount<br/>
seems to be bigger.  My bard has 110 charisma and got a<br/>
combine longsword for 52.5pp.  I hear that 75 chr people get<br/>
charged 63.5pp.  That&#39;s a 0.827 ratio, not the 0.863 I found<br/>
above.  (Yes, I could buy combine weapons and sell at 5pp less<br/>
than &quot;normal&quot; people would pay, and still make a tidy profit.)<br/>
The most expensive item I&#39;ve priced is a well-balanced 2hsword<br/>
at 447.681pp.  Maybe someone with 75 charisma could check the<br/>
price they&#39;re charged?  (And that merchant views me<br/>
indifferently)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d expect selling prices follow the same pattern, but I<br/>
haven&#39;t checked those.  (Now that I think about it, I should<br/>
check the spread between buying and selling prices.)<br/>
