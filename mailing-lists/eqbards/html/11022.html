<div id="ygrps-yiv-654187399">I mainly lurk on this list but I feel the time is right for me to say something:<br/>
On Monday Night my Guild Noble Warriors of Norrath went to Perma for a bit of hunting/camping, I as a young bard had visions of us leaving loaded to the gills with Cryst-blades, icygreaves, silvery axes and other assorted plunder.....<br/>
Our party formed up in the hall I sang my invis song and we walked up the ladder into the flag room, then someone moved out of range and became visible.LOADING.....PLEASE WAIT<br/>
Ran back re-mem&#39;d songs and started CR all went well, moved back in this time to the room with the Priest spawn...No AOE songs just Bellow,Amthem, Healing,Jig for our fighter now and then(long fights), and of course Elemental and Gardians for priest fights and every now and then the crack of my dual whips.<br/>
Then we got a tell from our enchanter(he was late) saying he was incoming to us. He arrived /yelling for help with every gobby from the entrance to the flag room chasing him, he cast Mez, he died....... Now was my turn to show the power of the bard!<br/>
BTW our group was bard=me, fighter,shaman,ranger,monk, and the now dead enchanter...<br/>
I whipped out my lute and began to play Lullabye, head nodding all around :-), i was shaking so badly I could barly type&quot; Attack one at a time and HEAL me!!&quot;.  About 5 min later I stood in the middle of the room with a ring of dead Gobbies all around me 57HP left and my party at almost full health.  I was estatic :-)))))). my party was in awe, the enchanter was pissed( he died remember). n Then it happend the words that everyone fears &quot;TRAIN, GET OFF THE TRACKS&quot; about 15 sec later our monk falls into the room bleeding from several deep cuts and falls dead. 5 sec later more Gobbies then I thought were in Perma boil into the room all looking for a crunchy Bard snack.....Lullybye back up....nods from everyone.....NO AGGGG the Priest RESISTED!!!!!!!! . &quot;ZONE, RUN NOW, LEAVE ME I&#39;LL HOLD THEM!!&quot; I yell to my party. Everyone who can runs for the zone.....LOADING.....Please Wait<br/>
<br/>
Now I ask you what went wrong? where are my Icy greaves? where is my Silvery Axe? What the hell is The Tome of the Wheel?<br/>
If ye can answer any of these questions please do :-)<br/>
Thanks for letting me share my time in perma with ye<br/>
Just so ya know I had fun it was the first time I&#39;ve been scared in a long time, in this game<br/>
