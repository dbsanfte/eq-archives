&gt; So, while it&#39;s hard to gain XP in a Hell Level - it seems that each time you<br/>
&gt; are killed - there is less loss than in other levels.  FYI - I have heard<br/>
&gt; that the Hell plus One levels are one-bub death penaltys for each time you<br/>
&gt; die - maybe only 46?  Or 41 and 46? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely a full bubble loss at 46.   Remember I said I would reach 47 last night? <br/>
Well the server crashed while we were doing fire giants in Sol B and Nagafen was<br/>
popped when we all returned.  So I stuck around until crazy hours on the dragon<br/>
raid.  Died 3 times *ouch* but only down one bubble total after the resurrections. <br/>
And I was alive when he finally fell: that felt good, seeing him fallen at my feet.<br/>
<br/>
And YES I now have Selo&#39;s Drums of the March.  Yeeehaaahhh!  (sorry Kelothos, you<br/>
next time)<br/>
