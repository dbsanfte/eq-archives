colors, and generate a file.  You might want to try there to get some idea<br/>
of how to generate what you want.<br/>

&gt; With all the hoohah on Abashi&#39;s lack of memory and Ester being on<br/>
vacation,<br/>
&gt; no one has mentioned one of the nicer things in the last patch - you can<br/>
&gt; control colors, run and screen mode defaults now.  I don&#39;t know about you,<br/>
&gt; but have you ever missed a song because the blue didn&#39;t show up well in<br/>
full<br/>
&gt; screen mode?  You ever forget to click run and get beat to death as you<br/>
&gt; supposedly selo&#39;s to zone?  I hate having to always change to full screen<br/>
&gt; (not much effort, but it does get old).  I like what Verant did here and<br/>
&gt; give them credit for it.  I just wish...  Ah, nevermind, enough said on<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; line already.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I want to share what I did and see if any of you have had any success<br/>
&gt; with the color changes.  I first made my songs red - I wanted to see them<br/>
&gt; boldly, but that mixed in with resist so not good.  I then changed songs<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; yellow - that shows up really well in all modes.  Damage shields (if you<br/>
&gt; still have them on) also show up in yellow, but I typically am not getting<br/>
&gt; beat on that long even if pulling, so not a problem.  I also changed skill<br/>
&gt; increases to red.  I use a parser sure, but I like to see them (or at<br/>
least<br/>
&gt; have a chance - blue sucks imho - I could never catch what was said -<br/>
song,<br/>
&gt; skill or whatever - in blue).  Anyone else play with this?<br/>
