<div id="ygrps-yiv-980282210"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;LOL - you really meant 45-50th bard for those items? <br/>
&gt;Those items fall within those level ranges and are very <br/>
&gt;acquireable by a NON-TWINKED bard at lvl 40+. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are absoutely right.  I was in the Lord&#39;s room and<br/>
Frenzied room just the other night.  Here&#39;s what I mean:<br/>
<br/>
/g SWORD!  He&#39;s got the sword.<br/>
<br/>
[insert battle here]<br/>
<br/>
/g Wooohoo!!!<br/>
/shout YKESHA!<br/>
<br/>
Party says &#39;Who gets it?  Someone who can use it.  No casters<br/>
            and the bard doesn&#39;t need it.  Here Warrior.&#39;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Who in their right mind is gonna give a bard a Ykesha or fbbs?<br/>
Twinked:  someone handed those items to the person through guild<br/>
connections.  Plus going on their knowledge alone, I would say<br/>
they didnt earn them (or someone bought an Ebay account, muhaha)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the confusion. =)<br/>
