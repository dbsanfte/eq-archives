 </span></blockquote>  Well, the Lambent helm and the SSB are identical imo.<br/>
<br/>
  Lambent Helm:         ac13 cha3 int5<br/>
  Skull Shaped Barbute: ac13 svmag10 hp35<br/>
<br/>
  They both have in my mind equally worthless qualities, and equally<br/>
  good ones.  You can never have enough charisma.  Intelligence?<br/>
  I think in the vein of keeping our stats balanced they did this,<br/>
  but intelligence drives 0% of our combat/group effectiveness.<br/>
  Save magic is nice, but your songs and others&#39; spells will always<br/>
  surpass any armor bonuses, if you really need the high resistance.<br/>
  Hit points 35?  Gimme a break, that&#39;s like 1/2 the dmg from one<br/>
  hit of any L35+ mob.<br/>
<br/>
  You could really argue most of the lambent armor is so-so, <br/>
  the mithbp with it&#39;s agi boost, gives you equal if not better<br/>
  ac than the lambentbp.  And azure sleeves have more ac than<br/>
  the lambent arms, minus the minor saves and cha.  I personally<br/>
  wear all lambent to look good.  I will use the non-visible spots<br/>
  to tweak my stats to where I&#39;d like them to be.<br/>
<br/>
  On a full blue suit, I think the silver helm looks goofy.<br/>
<br/>
  #1 - look good.<br/>
  #2 - fight good.<br/>
  #3 - if you can do both, then you&#39;re a god.<br/>
