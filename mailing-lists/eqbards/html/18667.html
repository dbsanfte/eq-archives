<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569486106">Hmm part of the problem is you&#39;re fighting mobs that DoT you.  Kind of a<br/>
dissadvantage there because your heal song can&#39;t quite keep pace with full<br/>
poison *yet*.   Against standard monsters that don&#39;t have a DOT effect<br/>
(poison) you will fare much better because you will actually heal during the<br/>
fight (rather than just holding your own against the poison, let alone the<br/>
dmg the nasty is doing).<br/>
<br/>
Try it against a young kodiak or a sand scarab in NRO and see how they<br/>
compare.  I found that at 12th (when we get bellow) the all instrument<br/>
attack started to be a little better than weapons especially in groups as<br/>
the tank wouldn&#39;t take much damage at all, if any.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting mobs that DoT is like fighting a mob that is 2 cons higher than<br/>
normal.  IE:  A white is as hard as a deep yellow *(almost red)* con.  A<br/>
blue can be as hard as a white.  I didn&#39;t mess with asps until 12th when I<br/>
had the option to run away and blast them for a bit with bellow if I needed<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  And get that Hand to Hand skill up :)  You will find that once<br/>
you get it up where your weapons skill is you have a much easier time of it.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] ...but it&#39;s still easier than playing a rogue<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Greetings all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tried my first all-instrument attack last night.  I was battling blues<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the Southeast corner of West Commons and the Southwest corner of East<br/>
&gt; Commons.  First I tried a giant spider in WC.  It took me down to two<br/>
&gt; bubbles, but I won.  And I got hand to hand up to 3!  Woohoo!  So I tried<br/>
&gt; another spider, which also took me down to two bubbles, and got hand to<br/>
hand<br/>
&gt; up to 4.  Then a ghoul showed up so I moved to EC and attacked an asp.<br/>
&gt; Well, an &quot;asp&quot; got whooped alright, but it wasn&#39;t the snake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I retrieve my corpse and try another asp.  I show my wisdom by zoning<br/>
&gt; before I die, but display my lack of intelligence by not leaving myself<br/>
&gt; enough HPs to survive the poison.  I loose consciousness the minute I hit<br/>
&gt; WC, never getting Hymn started.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DONG!  You have lost a level!  Welcome back to level 10, dummy!<br/>
&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I retrieve my corpse and ditch the instruments in favor of my FS 1H<br/>
&gt; slasher and kite shield (don&#39;t I feel twinked &lt;g&gt;) and look for some more<br/>
&gt; spiders.  I attack one and another joins in.  I swear this is the first<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve ever seen a giant spider assist another.  I mean I know spiders are<br/>
&gt; like that, but I&#39;ve just never seen it happen.  I&#39;ve also never noticed<br/>
&gt; spiders stunning me before.  I just BARELY make the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back on the EC side I try my luck with another asp.  Wicked close, this<br/>
&gt; battle.  I loose consciousness twice, but survive.  I search for another<br/>
&gt; snake but instead find a lesser mummy.  So I head back to WC.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An asp is there waiting for me.  I fair better with this one.  It&#39;s still<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; close call, but I don&#39;t loose consciousness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DING!  You have gained a level!  Welcome back to level 11!  Be more<br/>
careful<br/>
&gt; this time, silly!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; More careful?  Me?  Heh.  It occurs to me that if I can get my H to H<br/>
skill<br/>
&gt; (currently at 5) up to where my 1H slash skill is (57) that I might just<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; able to kick some asp.  WC is empty, so I zone back to EC and find another<br/>
&gt; serpent.  The battle commences but is not looking promising.  So I ditch<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; lute mid-battle.  Victory!  Woohoo!  I find another asp.  I reequip my<br/>
lute<br/>
&gt; and this time don&#39;t stop playing until about 2/3 of the way through the<br/>
&gt; battle.  Victory!  Woohoo!  I find another asp.  I reequip my lute and<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; time stop playing the moment I switched to 3rd person view and discover<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; actually found a nest of asps.  Run away!  Woohoo!  I equip my drum and<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; my asp out of there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back in WC I spy a spider creeping along.  I reequip my lute and this time<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t stop playing until...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back in Freeport a guildmate accuses me of hanging out at the tavern<br/>
&gt; drinking.  Why anyone would assume I&#39;m at a tavern just because they keep<br/>
&gt; seeing me in Freeport is beyond me.  But anyway, I run back to WC and<br/>
&gt; reequip my lute just long enough to bonk myself on the head with it, then<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; put it away in favor of more conventional weaponry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another dead spider, another dead asp.  Things are looking up.  So I start<br/>
&gt; thinking about that hand to hand skill again, wondering how much damage I<br/>
&gt; *could* be doing.  Well...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Little miss bard<br/>
&gt; did her shield discard<br/>
&gt; and picked up her lute to play<br/>
&gt; along came a spider<br/>
&gt; with poison insider her<br/>
&gt; saying &quot;Minstrel, this isn&#39;t your day&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I retrieve my corpse and equip my drum.  This time I don&#39;t stop playing<br/>
&gt; until I reach the tavern.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Peace<br/>
&gt; Evulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare<br/>
