&gt;         I thought the same thing at first but I&#39;ve seen strange things that would<br/>
&gt; beg to differ. An example was when I was fighting something and was stacking<br/>
&gt; Chords, Hymn, and Jonthan&#39;s in that order. Even though I did not see any<br/>
&gt; wince message or orange flare the creature I was fighting died (&#39;A<br/>
&gt; &lt;creature&gt; dies.&#39; not &#39;You have slain a &lt;creature&gt;.&#39;) from the Chords when<br/>
&gt; Jonthan&#39;s was pulsing, two whole pulses after the &#39;signaled&#39; one. I think<br/>
&gt; Hymn will also heal throughout all three pulses as well. At least that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what I&#39;ve noticed anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why the creature you were fighting died, given the three songs you&#39;re<br/>
referring to.<br/>
<br/>
As to the Hymn healing through all three pulses, I don&#39;t think so.  I have not<br/>
verified this since beta, so there&#39;s always a chance it has changed, but as far as I<br/>
can tell you only get the increased heal effect whenever you see the actual words<br/>
&quot;Your wounds begin to heal&quot;.  This is easy to test though, and I&#39;ll check tonight.<br/>
