<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314940088">Personally I think EQ is a dull, boring solo game.  If I want to solo - I&#39;ll<br/>
play Baldur&#39;s Gate 2 or even Diablo 2.  While others are more concerned<br/>
about leveling rapidly and gaining platinum etc - I can understand the<br/>
desire to solo; but I think what makes EQ a great game is the interaction<br/>
between players.  Soloing too much leads to a lack of the skills that make a<br/>
bard valuable in groups.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never soloed in 56 levels and close to 2.5 years of barding.  I do a<br/>
lot of raiding (regardless of our value or lack thereof).  I don&#39;t mean this<br/>
as a slam against those who like to solo - just pointing out my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s interesting that the designers of EQ have spent SO much effort<br/>
on zones and encounters that are clearly dominated by large groups of raids;<br/>
but have done little to aid actually managing these.  The server filter is a<br/>
huge help - but changing the XP rules, and the lack of a dynamic raid<br/>
channel are a major hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
The concern for XP on raids is one thing that often leads to raid failure.<br/>
Casters will be tempted to over nuke screwing up proper aggro management...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably too deep in code until EQ2 (who knows when that will come<br/>
out) - but the ability to create a raid - similar to a guild in creation<br/>
would be great.  It should give another chat channel - and should share XP<br/>
for everyone signed up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to see it include people out of zone from dying  - if you die in<br/>
the encounter - but haven&#39;t been rezed when the mob was killed - you should<br/>
share in the XP.<br/>
<br/>
I can see potential for abuse - but with though they could be minimized...<br/>

Hmm well I can see your point, and  probably haven&#39;t noticed it because I<br/>
haven&#39;t been on many raids with my bard.  But the shammy getting exp on<br/>
raids? *dies laughing*</div>
