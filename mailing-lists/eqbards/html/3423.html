<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116243385">I just hit Level 6 last night (very happy to get the<br/>
Heal song :) Anyway I have been keeping up a number of<br/>
weapon skills. Since level 3 I have kept 1 hand slash,<br/>
1 hand Blunt and Piercing all maxed. I have tried to<br/>
keep Hand to Hand maxed as well but it seems to raise<br/>
a few points each level and then stop. Does this skill<br/>
cap lower per level than the other weapon skills? <br/>
<br/>
Second question is about being interupted while<br/>
playing. My only other character is a Rogue so forgive<br/>
me if my magic user references are wrong, don&#39;t know<br/>
much about them :)  When I got my heal song I took off<br/>
after a skeleton that conned white to me. I was<br/>
interupted alot. This had not really happened before<br/>
at least not this much! Is Intstrument/Singing skill<br/>
what helps prevents Bards being interupted like<br/>
Channeling is to Magic user casting? If not what is?<br/>
BTW I beat the skeleton but was not pretty *grins*<br/>
<br/>
Third (almost done :) on getting a new song about how<br/>
long is it level wise or skill wise before you can<br/>
count on playing that song well? Is there such a time?<br/>
Another thing that surprised me was that I mess up<br/>
playing that Heal song alot more than any of the other<br/>
songs I have.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly I noticed when I bought my Drums at level 5<br/>
from the wood elf vendor she sold a Mandolin and Lute<br/>
as well. Is there a difference in these two for<br/>
playing purposes? Or are they just two options for<br/>
string instruments?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for the help and safe travels.<br/>
