 </span></blockquote>Depends who you usually group with.  If you&#39;re with casters,<br/>
then I agree.  But I&#39;m usually in all-melee or primarily melee<br/>
groups.  With fights typically lasting 3+ minutes, the weapons<br/>
*do* average 4-5 procs per fight.  :)  (I enjoy grouping with<br/>
casters too, but long melee fights makes the effect of my<br/>
songs more obvious so I can fine tune the mix better.)<br/>

&gt; see why you guys think it is crappy.  Granted it is<br/>
&gt; off a dragon and is only marginally better than your<br/>
&gt; ykesh or ebw.  However, unless you have a planar<br/>
&gt; weapon I would consider this better.  Anyway, anyone<br/>
&gt; on Tunare who think this weapon is crappy--I will<br/>
&gt; gladly take your crappy weapon!<br/>

my book.  :)<br/>
