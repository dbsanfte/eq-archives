<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-243285298">Lyrnia I have to disagree on one point.  There is no way the secondary<br/>
resist was added before last Sept/Oct.  Before that I never got a mob<br/>
attacking me after a successful &quot;nods&quot; message.  They might have thought the<br/>
secondary resist was in, but it didn&#39;t work if it was.<br/>
<br/>
An enchanter and any melee class can derail a large train of blues and<br/>
slaughter them one by one.  They face the same level of risk as two bards<br/>
trying this.  It was not overly powerful.  Without being able to use other<br/>
songs a bard is a very poor melee fighter at level 15+ when he has Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby with just a Lute would be just as useless as it is now.  It would be<br/>
cool for saving newbies from a train in Blackburrow, but pointless in normal<br/>
combat situations.  Unless you want to just stand there and play just<br/>
Lullaby while the rest of the group actually fights.  That&#39;s why my<br/>
enchanter is just gathering dust, I found I don;t want to just stand (err<br/>
sit) there and Mez until someone needs Quickness or Breeze refreshed.<br/>
