<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062360304">what i have heard from the people who started my guild, is that many smaller<br/>
level raids prepare you for the big ones.  these would be along the lines of<br/>
ghoul lord in guk, live king in guk, efreeti in sol B, etc.  learning<br/>
tactics and group strategy in these smaller type raids will give you the<br/>
know-how and the experience to try the big ones.<br/>
<br/>
on the dragon roar (that&#39;s the fear spell right?) resisting... i haven&#39;t<br/>
gotten feared in the last several raids.  now sometimes i get the message<br/>
that i resist the dragon roar spell, other times i get the message that i<br/>
lose control of myself, i get the fear icon, but no effect.  what&#39;s up with<br/>
that?<br/>

&gt; 49 & 50 level<br/>
&gt; players to go on dragon raids, then how are the 40-48 level <br/>
&gt; people ever<br/>
&gt; gonna learn how to do it?  <br/>
