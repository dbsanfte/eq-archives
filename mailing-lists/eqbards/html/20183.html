<div id="ygrps-yiv-274508999">Ah, good to know about the &quot;suicide&quot; aspect of my proposal. Of course, if <br/>
it was easy, what would be the point. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I just figured it would be doable, considering who slow these things are. <br/>
Cyclopses sometimes catch up to me due to their speed. My main concern was <br/>
the fear spells that these things cast.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I&#39;ll head over to Kunark. Hopefully soon.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Solo Spectre Camp Break?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was cruising my little &#39;ol blue level 33 self across the Oasis and<br/>
&gt;recalled that I was able to charm a Spectre not to long ago (with lots of<br/>
&gt;resists, but I was successful).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone successfully broken the camp solo? The Spectres are so slow and<br/>
&gt;we can run over the water pretty easily, figured someone must have done<br/>
&gt;this.<br/>
