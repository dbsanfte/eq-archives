<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961829905"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;&gt; Yep, it&#39;s true.  Rangers and Rogues in particular are complaining up a<br/>
&gt;storm about how good the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; bard armour is compared to theirs.<br/>
&gt;Rogues I can understand, but Rangers!?!  I don&#39;t mean to gripe (well, yes I<br/>
&gt;do ;p ), but have any of them taken a look at the armor and 1H Slash lists<br/>
&gt;at Allakhazam&#39;s site?  Just go by and look at all the nifty Ranger-only<br/>
&gt;items there.  Gosh, let&#39;s see... how many bard-only weapons are listed<br/>
&gt;there?  NONE :oP  Bard only armor (pre-patch) 1, and that&#39;s from PoF.<br/>
&gt;Ranger&#39;s have no room to gripe.  Period.  (IMO)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I spent my evening last night with my druid taxiing a ranger friend around <br/>
so he could get his new armor.  He got both bracers and the sleeves.  I saw <br/>
the stats for these pieces myself.  On the bracers and sleeves, AC and <br/>
weight are the same as rubicite (which is what he was replacing) plus stat <br/>
bonuses.  The ivy etched armor is VERY nice stat-wise (I don&#39;t like how it <br/>
looks though).<br/>
<br/>
Although it appears that Verant forgot to add boots and pants for the <br/>
rangers, the rest of the gear is nothing to complain about.  I suppose those <br/>
that are complaining are the ones that would gripe  regardless.<br/>
<br/>
As to the question on lambent stones, I saw one being auctioned last night <br/>
in Kithicor. (this was on Povar)  I was a bit sceptical, since my <br/>
understanding is that the components needed for these quests are all no <br/>
drop/lore.  Nary a hg or griffon did I see all evening while we ran all over <br/>
Norrath and back.  I am hoping lambent stones don&#39;t turn out to be a rare <br/>
item.<br/>
