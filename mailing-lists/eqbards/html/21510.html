<div id="ygrps-yiv-552344452">Until I started playing other classes seriously, I did not fully appreciate<br/>
the value of mana regen.  Now, I play a Cleric (52), an Enchanter (51 & 22),<br/>
and a Wizard (34) as much or more than my 53 bard.  Mana regen without ench<br/>
or bard is simply unacceptable.  Certain classes &quot;add&quot; to groups; other<br/>
classes &quot;multiply&quot; the effectiveness of the group. I don&#39;t see that as a<br/>
trivial function.   <br/>

Maestro was.)  Also, a random encouter with Faydwer (sp?) the Tim Deep<br/>

I think the problem is that most of us have already re-evaluated our<br/>
playlists and determined that in 95% off all balanced groups, the most<br/>
effective thing you can do is be a mana/hp battery. The Cantana/Nivs/Mana<br/>
song combo is so powerful, it&#39;s almost always the &quot;best&quot; thing you can do.</div>
