<b>Subject:</b> Re: Smithing and &quot;spoilers&quot; <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807427303">PLEASE do not fall into this trap. I personally do not care about so-called<br/>
&quot;spoilers&quot;. I would not be reading this list if I did not want info about<br/>
the game. The game absurdly poorly documented, making things like this list<br/>
a god send. Here I can learn things that otherwise would take me pointless<br/>
hours of frustration that could be spent actually having fun in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I personally will post any and all useful information here that I think<br/>
will help all of you have more fun with the game. I strongly encourage<br/>
everyone else to do the same. If you don&#39;t like &quot;spoilers&quot; (in other words<br/>
if figuring stuff out on your own is part of the fun to you) then simply<br/>
don&#39;t read the material here. <br/>
<br/>
So Jyzan here asks a great question, one which I would like to know the<br/>
answer to, since I have been looking for ore for ages. I now know I can buy<br/>
it in Steamfont, and I am hoping there is somewhere on the mainland I can<br/>
buy it.<br/>
<br/>
So if someone knows the answer, don&#39;t send it privately to Jyzan, send it<br/>
to all of us so that those of us who want to smith don&#39;t spend HOURS<br/>
looking for ore (which is NOT fun to me, I don&#39;t know about anyone else).<br/>

RP Note: In a role-play sense it is perfectly legitimate to tell an<br/>
aspiring smith a few tricks of the trade, and where to go to purchase his<br/>
supplies and practice his art.<br/>
