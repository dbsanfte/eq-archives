engine tends to snap you ontop of terrain or objects at times which can be<br/>
very bad.  Standing underneath a closing door or grate (Paw, Permafrost,<br/>
Neriak, Solusek) will pop you on top of the grate in the tiny area that it<br/>
raises up into.  Your only solution is to gate if you can, or get a<br/>
wizard/druid to group gate you out.  Also there&#39;s a number of buildings in<br/>
freeport with empty &#39;locked&#39; attics, if you climb around on stuff in some of<br/>
these buildings you&#39;ll get stuck locked in the attic.  So unless you&#39;ve got<br/>
gate (or a 29+ wiz/druids handy), be careful around situations like these.</div>
