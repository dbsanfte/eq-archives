<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349165864">Heh heh, again if you use Verant&#39;s definition of &quot;extensive testing&quot; which<br/>
does not include testing damage spells to the point of &quot;targeting a bat in a<br/>
newbie zone&quot;, gawds I love that saying, their statement is perfectly true.<br/>
&quot;Extensive testing&quot; = Its in the drop table and everything compiled.<br/>

Wow this is great news. I had been ranting about the bard&#39;s AC penalty on<br/>
our imbrued armor.. didn&#39;t think<br/>
anyone gave half a crap but at least the changes were made.<br/>
I can only bash Verant so much in one day... but why is our stuff suddenly<br/>
dropping now when they were<br/>
quoted on saying something like &quot;after extensive testing, we&#39;ve determined<br/>
that imbrued armor is still<br/>
dropping&quot; before the patch. That was posted on EQ Casters I believe after<br/>
the issue was raised that our<br/>
armor hadn&#39;t been dropping.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you guys out there with full suits of imbrued might tell us of the<br/>
ac bonuses.<br/>

&gt; Good news - the imbrued plate dropped in the alter planes for Bards has<br/>
&gt; received an upgrade in AC for several pieces. I don&#39;t know what all the<br/>
&gt; changes were, but ac upgrades are always welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other good news is Imbrued is now dropping again in Plane of Hate.<br/>
&gt; It hasn&#39;t dropped since the patch that tweaked the Monster AI in PoH,<br/>
&gt; and now drops on scorn banshees.<br/>
