I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>
and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>
seen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk up to 23rd and an<br/>
Enchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing that the best class in<br/>
the game was bard..  but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent, dual Ykeshas, Flowing Black<br/>
Silk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked out like a level 50<br/>
that hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago I saw a level 15 in<br/>
full Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other goodies as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly* discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor that I have and I *still*<br/>
lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on the sands of Oasis,<br/>
being *less* complete than a guy that started his bard last weekend.  Not<br/>
only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having 38 &#39;played&#39; days and not<br/>
being level 50.<br/>
<br/>
When there ceases to be any way for players&#39; characters to differentiate<br/>
themselves from one another other based upon level (i.e. time and effort<br/>
expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want, when people look at me,<br/>
for them to know that I braved death and died many times to achieve the<br/>
armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to assume that I bought it from<br/>
a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>
&quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>
different story.  The bard that I saw in Oasis would have been in steel<br/>
probably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based upon<br/>
my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know* that I had earned the<br/>
pieces for myself.  They would know that I had pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>
Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>
for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not being NO DROP has reduced my<br/>
efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>
<br/>
I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes me<br/>
feel this way.<br/>
