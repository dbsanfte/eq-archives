<div id="ygrps-yiv-757070039">&quot;I&#39;d like to find out if it really lost it&#39;s taunt factor... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only used it about 30 times since I&#39;ve had it, and it&#39;s never taunted<br/>
anything for me (this was all before the supposed Bard Taunt Reduction).<br/>
Heh, think of it this way:<br/>
<br/>
Bard:  Aaaaaaahh!  I&#39;m in trouble!  Time to go all out!<br/>
{Bard AE nukes mobs for 325}<br/>
{40th level mobs laugh at the bard&#39;s best attempt only causing a minor<br/>
scratch as they pound on the real damage dealers.}<br/>
<br/>
The best taunt for me has been twisting the three Chant lines, even if they<br/>
don&#39;t stick.  I could get ogre bouncers to glue onto me by the time they<br/>
were at 75% health -- I&#39;d run around in circles while my druid brother nuked<br/>
the snot out of them.  The Chants may have stuck about 10% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
One other argument for Screech over Dirge is that Dirge is limited to 4<br/>
mobs, so if you get a gross train (don&#39;t think they exist these days),<br/>
you&#39;ll have a problem.  Caveat: all of my experience has been on a live<br/>
server, where populations have gone from comfortable to atrocious, so I&#39;ve<br/>
never had the luxury of an undercrowded dungeon.<br/>
