<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805495657">You might have seen a variant of this already:<br/>
Get a piercing weapon as your second weapon.<br/>
After the first time your 1hs maxes, start using<br/>
the piercing skill.  Do this early.  If you wait &#39;til<br/>
16 like I did, it&#39;s very hard to bring up.<br/>
<br/>
Best piercing weapon you can find at that level<br/>
is a Giant Snake Fang.  Shouldn&#39;t pay more than<br/>
5 gp for it over in East Commonlands.<br/>

&gt;Hail All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I recently subscribed to this mailing list & have lurked <br/>
&gt;a couple of days to get the feel for it before jumping <br/>
&gt;in.  I&#39;m a very &quot;young&quot; (level 3) wood elf bard on the <br/>
&gt;Quellious server.  I&#39;ve left Kelethin because of the <br/>
&gt;extreme lag, same with Freeport (not to mention that dry <br/>
&gt;desert air was murder on my delicate elven skin ;).  So <br/>
&gt;as of last night, I&#39;m bound to Rivervale.  Eventually I <br/>
&gt;intend to make it clear across Norrath.  Yes, I have <br/>
&gt;wanderlust -- is it not a good thing I&#39;ve chosen bard as <br/>
&gt;my profession? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You are all so knowledgeable ... I&#39;m learning a lot from <br/>
&gt;reading all your posts.  Even though I only have 2 songs, <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve already started playing with the juggling I read <br/>
&gt;about here (never woulda thought of that myself).  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most of the advice I&#39;ve read so far will help me when I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;&quot;grown up&quot; a little (a lot?) more.  So I&#39;d like to ask <br/>
&gt;all of you for advice for a beginning bard.  I know some <br/>
&gt;of the decisions I make at the start will end up <br/>
&gt;affecting my success later in my life.  So any pointers <br/>
&gt;would be well appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance,<br/>
