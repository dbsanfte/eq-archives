<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628916087"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 2. Perhaps there is a way - and I just missed it, do we ever get to weild<br/>
&gt; one weapon and an instrument?  I could have sworn I saw a higher<br/>
&gt; level bard<br/>
&gt; doing just this once, but could never get it to equip. I figured<br/>
&gt; I might be<br/>
&gt; able to do this once I got dual wield, but if there is one that lets us do<br/>
&gt; it, I&#39;ve not found it yet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to get questions about this all the time when I carried a mino axe<br/>
and a drum or mandolin.  You CAN carry a weapon and an instrument at the<br/>
same time, the problem is you can&#39;t use the weapon in a conventional way.<br/>
Before I got dual wield I would put my mino axe in my range weapon slot and<br/>
my intrument in my secondary mellee slot.  This gave the appearance that I<br/>
was carrying a weapon and an instrument.  Too bad the only way I could use<br/>
the weapon would be to throw it at that point.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, have any of you bards used throwing skill at all? I&#39;ve<br/>
found it to be a collosal waste of money so far, but maybe I am doing it<br/>
wrong. :)</div>
