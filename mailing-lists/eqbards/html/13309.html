<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756333779">i know i could do that, but i feel cheap doing it in a duel.  with a mob i<br/>
don&#39;t mind, but in a duel i don&#39;t want any excuses from them when they lose.<br/>
i chain/feared a shaman once and he vowed never to duel me again.  i<br/>
promised not to and killed him anyway, but you get my point.  i expect to<br/>
lose against a melee class.  i expect to win against a caster.  but both<br/>
ways i will stand my ground! =)<br/>

&gt; Umm Shada... you need to take advice from me for once.<br/>
&gt; =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DON&#39;T STAND STILL=)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Move around, run around behind them, slow them down with <br/>
&gt; chains, Blast them<br/>
&gt; with an AE damage song, run around some more. Don&#39;t ever <br/>
&gt; stand still and let<br/>
&gt; them hit you. always keep moving, never stop. do not try and <br/>
&gt; out fight a<br/>
&gt; tank. use your damage songs and keep moving=)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then when they are at 200 or so HP, DIRGE them=)<br/>
