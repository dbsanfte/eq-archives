&gt; not underestimate a fast weapon.... There&#39;s formulas about this people<br/>
have posted here, I honestly think your problem is that damn axe...<br/>
 I use my spear, which has a fine damage/speed advantage.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with this.  I have been using a rapier/spear switch off<br/>
since lvl one...I too tried the mino axe but found that I was getting more<br/>
hits in with the rapier as opposed to the axe and I&#39;m using bronze still at<br/>
lvl 12...its a personal choice I know but I like the speed of the rapier<br/>
better...oh yeah, and it looks cool.<br/>
