 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a maximum CHA.  I think that Verant, in order to <br/>
protect themselves from inadvertently screwing up the economy (like it isn&#39;t <br/>
already), gave items a minimum and maximum price.  If your faction/charisma <br/>
would take them over/under the price, you just get the fixed value.  (This <br/>
may only happen if the numbers are in your favor - maximum on selling, <br/>
minimum on buying.)  My cleric friend and I went around testing prices at <br/>
various vendors using Carillon (for me) and various CHA equipment for <br/>
each of us, and we were both able to hit a minimum purchase price that <br/>
additional equipment/songs wouldn&#39;t effect with most of the vendors.<br/>
