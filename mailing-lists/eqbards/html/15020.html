<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641671157">Unless your definition of &quot;no problems&quot; is getting killed three or four<br/>
times you are completely incorrect.  Either Verant nerfed Camo and Clouding;<br/>
or there are mobs that cast See Invisible.<br/>
<br/>
Something definitely changed.  Until two weeks ago; I happily ran past these<br/>
guys singing Clouding to my heart&#39;s content.  Now they undoubtedly see<br/>
invis.  It happens so much that I suspect that the mobs that cast it<br/>
(assuming they didn&#39;t nerf Clouding) can do so from a distance (Z-axis<br/>
bug?).<br/>

&gt; Sorry if this was mentioned before, don&#39;t have time to read through all of<br/>
&gt; the responses right now :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So around the outside of the castle, the lake, the GY, you have no<br/>
problems<br/>
&gt; because those are the guards and such, and always live creatures. Just try<br/>
&gt; not to enter at night, and hope there aren&#39;t any undead ones still inside<br/>
:)<br/>
