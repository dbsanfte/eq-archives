<div id="ygrps-yiv-433607220">Hehe - actually I think you would also get a laff out of my /played time<br/>
which is I think more than 68 days now.  Most high lev&#39;s would really laff<br/>
that I am not PoF able with that amount of time logged in.  In fact, I guess<br/>
I disprove my own saying that all you have to do to level is put the time<br/>
in.  I am a really in-efficient player when it comes to time/level over all.<br/>
<br/>
Like it said, I started a war and played him to level 13. I played him and<br/>
Sylly alternately for about 3 weeks then robbed him and parked him.  I have<br/>
a few hours in other chars just to have a feel for the screens they look at<br/>
and the stuff they do - like casters.  I have a cleric who is level 8 and<br/>
slowly getting twinked up.  A big reason I play her is so that I stay out of<br/>
trouble when I have online time and my group is not around.  I am getting<br/>
real paranoid about dieing and the time required to make up for lost ground.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So ya, if you want to level, you need to focus on one char and be in a group<br/>
after lev 12 to 15 when you cant effectively solo any more.  That don&#39;t mean<br/>
that is what I did - I went weeks sometimes without a level - because I was<br/>
exploring or questing. Or adventuring and helping people. <br/>

		Wow, now that is a blast from the past.  On a related note.<br/>
The current<br/>
		Kitasi began a mere 5 days before Sylly, but is still only<br/>
18 songs along<br/>
		the path.  Maybe I should quit playing multiple characters.<br/>
;-)<br/>

		Saw that I had 1849 items in my bard folder and thought I<br/>
should toss a few<br/>
		out.  Jumped to the first one and thought you might enjoy...<br/>
