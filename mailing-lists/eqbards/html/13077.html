<b>Subject:</b> Bards vs Enchanters Part 2 with a little Lullaby thrown in (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062002571">Last night I was in Cazic camping the 4C area.  It was late at night and we had<br/>
the entire place to ourselves.  The party consisted of a 35 enchanter, 34<br/>
ranger, 34 paladin, 32 cleric, 27 bard and 30 bard(me).  Initially we were<br/>
camping along the outside wall.  The ranger pulled, the enchanter had crowd<br/>
control duties, and the other bard and I were able to keep six different songs<br/>
up all the time.  The ranger was a very good puller and never got more than two<br/>
mobs at a time.  Every combat was very efficient and no one ever lost more than<br/>
one bub of health.  We were there for over an hour and decided that based on our<br/>
success, we would move up to the top of the pyramid where the Archon spawns.<br/>
Everyone got fully buffed (I had 10 buff icons showing), full mana and we headed<br/>
up to the Archon invisible.<br/>
<br/>
We got to the top safely and gathered at one of the corners near to the steps<br/>
leading into the pyramid.   There was a full spawn waiting for us at the steps,<br/>
plus whatever was inside the pyramid.  I told everyone to hold tight.  Sent a<br/>
private /tell to the enchanter (Rakadar).  Rakadar and I have grouped together<br/>
on numerous occasions since we were both 5th level.  He is far and away the best<br/>
enchanter I have ever grouped with, a master at controlling a battle with his<br/>
crowd control spells.  I told him that with the number of mobs in front of us,<br/>
he would likely die if he tried an AE mez spell.  My reasoning was that there<br/>
was no way for the party to kill enough mobs before the AE mez wore off.  Once<br/>
the spell wore off and everything started attacking him, he most likely would<br/>
have trouble getting another AE mez off.  He agreed with my assessment.  He then<br/>
told me that if I tried putting them all to sleep with lullaby, then I would<br/>
likely die.  I agreed with his assessment.  Here is where the other bard (a<br/>
guildmate of mine) comes into play.  I informed the other bard that during the<br/>
fight, I would continually be singing Lullaby.  I told him to weave anthem and<br/>
lullaby continuously and mix in Hymn ever few rounds.  The enchanter would charm<br/>
one of the casting lizards and then focus on stunning the mob we were facing.  I<br/>
informed everyone of the plan and reminded the cleric to watch out for the two<br/>
bards health since we would be singing Lullaby.  Time to kick some lizard butt.<br/>
<br/>
We all /assisted the ranger and started the fight.  I started up Lullaby and was<br/>
horrified when I saw that I had put 10 lizards to sleep.  A couple of people<br/>
stated something to the effect of &quot;Oh crap.  We got 10 freaking lizards now.  We<br/>
should have stayed by the wall&quot;.  I assumed I would be the first to die.  Here<br/>
is where I received a pleasant surprise.  Out of the 10 lizards we were facing,<br/>
the only one attacking back was the one the tanks were meleeing.  For the most<br/>
part, nothing was attacking me at all.  Everyone once in a while I would get<br/>
attacked but I eventually put the mob back to sleep.  On a couple of occasions<br/>
when I did get attacked, I got stunned and stop singing Lullaby.  When this<br/>
happened and mobs woke up, instead of attacking me the mobs attacked the lower<br/>
level bard, who was weaving in Lullaby/Hymn as well.  Throughout the coarse of<br/>
the battle, he was the only player who was took any serious damage.  The cleric<br/>
took care of that though.  As soon as I was able to get Lullaby back up, the<br/>
situation was back in control.  <br/>
<br/>
Slowly but surely, we killed off the intial 10 mobs.  However, this took us so<br/>
long that as we got down to the last few mobs, new ones spawned along the steps.<br/>
I just kept singing Lullaby the entire fight.  Eventually we killed off all the<br/>
mobs.  All told, I think we were fighting lizards continuously for over 15<br/>
minutes.   We all stood around in disbelief at what we had just accomplished.<br/>
Final tally was Us:15 Lizards:0.  Everyone started hooting and hollering and<br/>
patting each other on the back.  Everyone was out of mana but no one was below<br/>
60% health.  Everyone agreed that the reason for our success were me and the<br/>
other bard keeping all the mobs out of the fight.  To say the least I was<br/>
ecstatic.<br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, I wished I would have turned on the log file function prior to the<br/>
fight so I could have collected some test data for the ongoing Lullaby issue.<br/>
Like so many of us, I was convinced the song was broken.  It may be that two<br/>
bards singing Lullaby (one continuously and the other weaving it in) negated the<br/>
problem of mobs still attacking after the initial resist.  Even if a mob<br/>
resisted my song the first time, he still had to resist the other bards song.<br/>
I think it also helped that my charisma was 149 and the other bards was 145<br/>
(with sympathetic aura buff).  All I can say is that last night was the most fun<br/>
I&#39;ve had playing EQ in a long time and that I&#39;m further convinced that a bard<br/>
and enchanter in the same group make a lethal combination.  <br/>
