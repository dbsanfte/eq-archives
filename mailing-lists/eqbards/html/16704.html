<div id="ygrps-yiv-573072414">I didn&#39;t mean from the perspective of losing time fixing one thing as<br/>
opposed to another.  Hmm, this seems to be a day of rephrasing myself here<br/>
and at work.  I understand that the programmers probably lost almost no time<br/>
changing this as opposed to something else.<br/>
<br/>
My big question is.  They supposedly have these big &#39;Tuning&#39; meetings every<br/>
week to figure out what needs balancing in the game.  How on earth did they<br/>
come to the conclusion that this needed &#39;Tuning&#39; in the first place?  When<br/>
was the first time you ever heard casters as a whole, not by class or about<br/>
class, complain that &#39;Melee types have it way too easy, they rule this<br/>
game.&quot;  Answer, never, absolutely never.  Yet you hear the same thing about<br/>
casters in one form or another every single day if you read the boards.  The<br/>
imbalance between pure casters and everyone else is so huge its embarrassing<br/>
and yet no one at Verant will acknowledge it in any way.  They should have<br/>
named the game Evercast if this is the way they really want it.  I can&#39;t<br/>
figure out if they are just so out of touch with the reality of the game due<br/>
to their own arrogance that they can&#39;t see it, or if they just all play<br/>
casters primarily and don&#39;t really want it to be balanced.  Melee classes<br/>
are really not much more than intelligent pets for casters as it currently<br/>
stands.<br/>
<br/>
I had a philosophical discussion with three grouped Necros last nite about<br/>
joining them in Sol A.  Once they found out I didn&#39;t have mana song they<br/>
were not interested in having me in a group.  They all said the same thing,<br/>
you won&#39;t really help much but you will reduce our xp.  My healing ability<br/>
meant next to nothing to them as they saw getting wounded as nothing more<br/>
than an opportunity to get the full effect from their Lifetap series.  I<br/>
literally had nothing to offer them.  Since our songs don&#39;t effect pets, and<br/>
they were the ones doing the meleeing, I couldn&#39;t help them.  The only<br/>
limitation to what they could handle was the hard 6 cap on resists.  Maybe<br/>
that&#39;s why I am so grouchy today.<br/>

While there are a great many things that they could be spending their time<br/>
on, look at it this way: Verant&#39;s staff is broken up into many tasks, so<br/>
updating this aspect of gameplay probably doesn&#39;t affect their ability to<br/>
work on the other broken areas in any way. In all likelihood, there is a<br/>
spell database, which has a field entitled &quot;recast time&quot;. In order to<br/>
facilitate this change, all they need to do is hire someone to do data entry<br/>
and have them update the spell database. This shouldn&#39;t take up any<br/>
programmer&#39;s time.<br/>

No its not that I want to complain that now they can chain cast buffs.  I&#39;m<br/>
more irritated in that I think there are things far more &#39;broken&#39; for other<br/>
classes and that they should spend their time on finding way to tweak the<br/>
non-purecasting classes to make them better as they are already behind.  Why<br/>
on earth would Necros need any enhancement whatsoever at this point???<br/>

I don&#39;t think this is worth us griping about.  (maybe because I play my<br/>
cleric and not my bard now).<br/>
<br/>
Does it really hurt us now that bufferes can chain cast their buffs?  It<br/>
was merely an annoyance  that you had to wait a few seconds for some<br/>
buffs to recycle.  I have no idea their system for cast time/recycle<br/>
time on buffs, its seems totally random and thrown together (that would<br/>
be a shocke eh?)<br/>
<br/>
Examples:  From lvl 9 to 19 cleric buffs are Holy Armor (lvl 4) and<br/>
Center.  At 19 you get Spirit Armor and Daring.  Center has a medium<br/>
recycle time and longer cast time then Holy armor.  However, Spirit<br/>
Armor has a REALLY long cast and recycle time, yet daring is short in<br/>
both cases.  I guess I fail to see the need to limit the power of spirit<br/>
armor (gives 12 ac)...<br/>
