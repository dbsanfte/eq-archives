after the changes this weekend.<br/>

&gt; PvP games have better potential for open ended interest.  Playing against<br/>
&gt; human brains is a lot more fun than against NPC&#39;s that do the same thing<br/>
&gt; over and over. (I wish my friends would have switched to PvP server about 48<br/>
&gt; levels ago but we decided to stay on Innoruuk.)  There is no dynamic to EQ<br/>
&gt; NPC&#39;s.  Once you find out what they do, you can rely on them to do it onver<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s actually one of the reasons I like PvE.  Because things<br/>
are pretty much the same, I can do tests that are repeatable<br/>
to figure out what does the most damage/time.  PvP tends to be<br/>
a lot less reliant on tactics (what you as an individual do)<br/>
and more on strategy (what your group does).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; songs - and some of them actually work.)  But do any of us have significant<br/>
&gt; experience in &quot;guildwar&quot; combat?  Where multiple groups of comparable level<br/>
&gt; and equipment face off to accomplish some tactical and or strategic goal?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve done this several times.  The winning team was<br/>
always the one with more redundancy.  With a specialized team,<br/>
once you kill the cleric, it&#39;s pretty much over.  With<br/>
redundancy, the other group tries to kill our cleric, who just<br/>
gets healed by our druid and paladin.  Meanwhile we&#39;re busy<br/>
killing their cleric.<br/>
<br/>
If you do a web search on &quot;Trillion Credit Squadron&quot; you&#39;ll<br/>
come across one of the more interesting AI research projects.  <br/>
The idea behind TCS was to design a starship fleet based on<br/>
the Traveller rules and a set budget, then pit them against<br/>
each other.  Some guy wrote a computer program to design the<br/>
optimal fleet.  Turns out the optimal fleet was one where<br/>
every ship was the same.  It had no weak point, no capitol<br/>
ship - no head you could chop off.  After the computer program<br/>
won for 2-3 years in a row, they canceled the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, with the fix to our Chant songs (they now do a nice<br/>
amount of damage using a drum) and my acquiring a haste belt<br/>
last night, I now have lots of options in a fight than Hymn,<br/>
Niv&#39;s, Verses, and CoC.  So I&#39;m happy with the state of a L50<br/>
bard for the time being.  Still wish they&#39;d fix mez though.<br/>
