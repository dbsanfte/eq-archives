<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419773739">Being that I have a level 21 warrior, I can tell you that it isn&#39;t possible<br/>
to taunt anything off of someone else, especially if the person keeps<br/>
whacking or casting.  I have my taunt maxed, and usually max it at new<br/>
levels within one or two fights.  I can taunt any green or blue off of<br/>
someone in 2 taunts, any white off in 4 taunts (unless they are below 2<br/>
bubbles health), but yellows and reds can be *extremely* hard to taunt off,<br/>
in that our skill isn&#39;t high compared to whatever it is that makes mobs<br/>
&quot;resist&quot; the taunts.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t rely on a warrior to take all the damage if you are dumb and get 5<br/>
mobs on you.  BTW, I taunt the entire time during a fight, and I&#39;ve seen<br/>
wizards stand next to the mob and peel if off of me in one cast, then I have<br/>
to turn my attention elsewhere and waste time trying to peel while getting<br/>
hit from behind.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well, These are inane, it is NOT the bards job to extricate him<br/>
&gt; &gt;or herself, for one simple reason YOU CAN&#39;T. A same level warrior<br/>
&gt; &gt;cannot taunt anything off me, not ever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then it&#39;s time to find a new warrior, because the one you are<br/>
&gt; grouping with sucks.  Tell them to learn how to click the Taunt<br/>
&gt; button more.  A warrior can taunt _anything_.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Stopping hitting them does absolutly zip when you are<br/>
&gt; &gt;singing a debuff like chains or dennons or god forbid<br/>
&gt; &gt;you have lulled them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nothing frenzies a monster quicker than a pixie strike, charm<br/>
&gt; mix.  The monster stays on me for 3 or 4 round, and then the<br/>
&gt; warrior has taunted enough to pull it off me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;They will hit you, there is no point in not hitting back.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am in the near perfect group as I have said before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They will kill you if you think you are gonna tank damage.<br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s face it, we&#39;ve got no hp.  At level 31, I have 700 or<br/>
&gt; so hp.  I&#39;m fighting monsters that do 50 - 80 damage a pop,<br/>
&gt; and sometimes double attack.  It is YOUR job to pull out as<br/>
&gt; soon as possible from a confrontation, and let the tank TAUNT<br/>
&gt; it off you always.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whether you use your weapons or not, 90% of the damage in<br/>
&gt; most typical battles comes from the casters and tanks.<br/>
&gt; You are supporting the battle with your buffs, debuffs,<br/>
&gt; crowd control, healing.  I&#39;m not saying to stop swinging,<br/>
&gt; cause that doesnt matter at all, I&#39;m just saying don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; continue to piss off a frenzied monster any more than it<br/>
&gt; is.  The tanks are more suited at absorbing damage than<br/>
&gt; you are.<br/>
