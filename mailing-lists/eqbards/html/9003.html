<b>Subject:</b> Mistmoore quest components <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-151391614">When all the details about the bard armor quests came out, I was initially<br/>
disappointed that I would not be able to do the quests due to my level (25<br/>
bard).  I just assumed that I would have to wait until I was around 30th<br/>
level before starting.  I guess I have been lucky so far because I have been<br/>
able to acquire six of the items.  For a few of them, guildmembers in their<br/>
mid 30s helped me out.  For the others, people couldn&#39;t use/loot them them<br/>
so they let me loot the items.  <br/>
<br/>
Always willing to take a risk, I&#39;m thinking about heading to Mistmoore after<br/>
I get the bracelet in Unrest.  Need to get an idea of how tough the deadly<br/>
usher and gypsy musicians are.  I hope to join with a higher level group<br/>
(assuming they will accept a 25 bard in the group).  Assuming a full group<br/>
of six, what level characters are required to fight against these mobs?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, the only places I&#39;ve gone to in Mistmoore are the initial areas beside<br/>
the lake and the graveyard.  Nothing I ran into in those locations could see<br/>
through the invisibility song.   Are there any mobs deeper in the zone that<br/>
can See Invis?  I would assume that the DE casters can buff themselves with<br/>
the spell.  Got a bad feeling that all the gargoyles can as well.  Still<br/>
willing to take the chance though.<br/>
