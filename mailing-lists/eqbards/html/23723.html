&gt; Believe me the challenge is NOT gone when it still takes a guild of 50<br/>
&gt; people with many Donals&#39; 6 hours to kill two dragons.  Its not as &quot;heat and<br/>
&gt; stir&quot; as you seem to think.  Can&#39;t even begin to tell you the hours we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; spent haha.  It takes a cleric 30 seconds to cast his bp - its not like its<br/>
&gt; instantaneous. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes I believe I said I DID read the whole post.  I know they will plan to<br/>
&gt; downlevel the mobs.  I just hope they actually do it.  It has nothing to do<br/>
&gt; with loot but everything to do with conquoring challenges.  I just like the<br/>
&gt; challenges to be fair.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then again, maybe Paradigm sucks and we have no strategy, dunno.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Back when Velious was in beta a friend of mine who was in it told me<br/>
they&#39;d upped the hp on mobs past the 32k limit. He was really excited as<br/>
he thought now they could drop all the cheezy design tricks they&#39;d had<br/>
to use to help the mobs kill you before they went down from limited hp.<br/>
As we&#39;ve seen since release however, VI has a tough time dropping the<br/>
cheeze, what with quad hitting for 850 and AoE mana drain. I expect the<br/>
&quot;detuning&quot; of those mobs to suffer from the same problem. VI is now<br/>
accustomed to cheeze design and can&#39;t seem to change now.<br/>
