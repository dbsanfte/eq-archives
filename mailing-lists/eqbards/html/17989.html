<b>Subject:</b> Selo&#39;s and root clarification <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611411838">Selo&#39;s works dirrently with the different root spells.<br/>
<br/>
Up in Everfrost last week and pulling Snow Orc Shaman<br/>
at S. Tower.  Their root spell (mountain icon) would<br/>
stop me cold but it never lasted more than a few<br/>
moments while I was playing Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
In North and West Karana I was fighting bandits and<br/>
raiders.  Their root spell is the druid root (little<br/>
leafy tree icon) and I could continue to run while the<br/>
icon was on-screen.<br/>
