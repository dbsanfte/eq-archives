<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877876717">Hi everyone. This is my first post in a while even though I&#39;m a long time<br/>
reader. You&#39;ll be hearing alot more from me.<br/>
<br/>
Books - Haven&#39;t really ready any bard specific novels, but if you&#39;re<br/>
thinking of dabbling in the fantasy genre, you MUST read the Wheel of Time<br/>
series by Robert Jordan. This guy is described as a cross between J.R.R.<br/>
Tolkien and Stephen King. He is an amazing writer and hands down my fav.<br/>
It&#39;s currently an 8 book series (most recent was released September 98) and<br/>
he plans on writing more until they bury him. (Also, there is an EverQuest<br/>
type RPG planned to come out sometime this year based on this game. It&#39;s not<br/>
going to be mass-multiplayer, but it looks to be pretty kick-ass<br/>

<br/>
Soerbaird - I understand we have a member participating in this chain. I<br/>
love the idea behind your guild and I was actually considering applying,<br/>
however I don&#39;t understand why so much money is required to be a member.<br/>
Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, isn&#39;t it somewhere along the lines of 100pp to join<br/>
and a monthly fee besides? I am an officer in the largest and arguably<br/>
oldest online gaming guild (The Syndicate www.thesyndicate.org ) and we<br/>
don;t charge our members any fees. Understandably if Verant implements Guild<br/>
housing we will require fees to help fund a guild house, but currently there<br/>
is no reason to collect from our members, unless of course you&#39;re doing it<br/>
for &quot;future necessities&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As far as this chain goes, I gotta say you guys and gals are the best. I<br/>
have quite a few characters (sue me, I can&#39;t seem to pick a favorite) and I<br/>
belong to a few mailing lists, and everyone can&#39;t hold a candle to this bard<br/>
list. I honestly do think it&#39;s a certain type of person that plays a bard.<br/>
That said, here&#39;s the man behind my mask:<br/>

lunacy, yet far enough away where I have the quiet of the country.<br/>
