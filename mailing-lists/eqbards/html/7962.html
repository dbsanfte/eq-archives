&gt;That could have been the case but since muddites rarely spawn (if at all) at<br/>
&gt;the bottom of the the gorge, I think on that occasion, the train was due to<br/>
&gt;them hearing the song through the mountain walls.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have a good idea on how far the radius extends on DDD and CoD?<br/>
&gt;I think this could be tested by singing the song with a person standing<br/>
&gt;nearby who isn&#39;t in your group.  I&#39;m fairly certain that when you sing DDD<br/>
&gt;or CoD, anyone standing within the radius who isn&#39;t in your group gets a<br/>
&gt;message saying something to the effect &quot;Galtin sings a song but you it does<br/>
&gt;not affect you&quot;.  They could gradually move away from you until they no<br/>
&gt;longer get the message.  You could then compare /loc grids to see how far<br/>
&gt;away the radius extends.  If you were somewhere like the aviak village in<br/>
&gt;SK, you could even confirm how far the radius extended along the z-axis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You also stated you use DDD all the time, even in indoor zones.  I thought<br/>
&gt;the general concensus of this list was that singing DDD in dungeons was very<br/>
&gt;risky due to the z-axis bug.  I will admit that I took that as an absolute<br/>
&gt;and as a result rarely use this song.  Would really like to know all the<br/>
&gt;&quot;safe&quot; areas to sing DDD/CoD.      <br/>

&gt;&gt; Careful not to confuse a monster swarm with area effect bugs.  I use DDD<br/>
&gt;&gt; all the time, even in indoor zones.  (Though I have had trouble in<br/>
&gt;&gt; Runnyeye).  Been using it in perma with no problems.  The thing you<br/>
&gt;&gt; describe below I&#39;ve had happen to non-bard characters as well.  It&#39;s like<br/>
&gt;&gt; you&#39;ve killed too many of that type of monster, and they all decide to<br/>
&gt;&gt; open<br/>
&gt;&gt; a can of whoop-ass on you.  Had that happen to me most recently in<br/>
&gt;&gt; steamfont while fighting earth elems.  All of a sudden, I see a whole<br/>
&gt;&gt; swarm<br/>
&gt;&gt; of them moving toward me (slowly, in that menacing earth elem way), wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; sure what was going on until too late.  :)<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;The more I think about the z-axis bug, the more I realize that it really<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;puts a hamper on our effectiveness.  I almost never have DDD or CoD<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;memorized unless I&#39;m in a wide open area in outdoor zone.  Don&#39;t assume<br/>
&gt;&gt; just<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;because you are outdoors the z-axis bug won&#39;t bite you.  One time I was<br/>
&gt;&gt; in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;the Beholder Maze fighting evil eyes and minos.  My group was camping<br/>
&gt;&gt; along<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;the wall in the gorge where the Lord evil eyes appear.  I sang DDD in<br/>
&gt;&gt; every<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;fight.  We were having a great time when all of a sudden just about every<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;muddite and mino in the entire zone came rushing into the gorge. Everyone<br/>
&gt;&gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;them starting attacking me so I can only assume that one of them got<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;affected by DDD through the mountain walls and started up a train.  If<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Verant can&#39;t/won&#39;t fix the z-axis bug, I would likely welcome a nerf<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;reducing the radius of DDD and CoD so we could use it more often.  <br/>
