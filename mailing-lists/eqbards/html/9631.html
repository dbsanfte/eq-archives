<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689202377"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Well hmm...  Can we hear from some people that DID find the quest items?  <br/>
&gt;Is there anything<br/>
&gt;special you did?  And how long did it take?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First champ I killed had the arms.  So did the third.  Then we didn&#39;t get <br/>
another set of arms until the last champ we killed 3 hours later.<br/>
<br/>
Took about 15 mages and 3 hours to get the boots.  We killed the king twice <br/>
in that time period I think.<br/>
