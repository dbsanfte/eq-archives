<div id="ygrps-yiv-904535162">Then why are they PvP?  Why give them the ability to interact this way at<br/>
all?  It like taking your kid into a candy store and leaving him alone<br/>
there, with no supervision and telling him not to eat any candy.  It makes<br/>
no sense.  I&#39;ve seen guides and Gm&#39;s interacting in these ways with the<br/>
players and the world all the time.  I have an older copy of the Guide regs,<br/>
it does state you are not to fight with other players but it in no way leads<br/>
you to believe that this is one of the &quot;10 commandments&quot;.<br/>

Um. Killing a player is not considered a minor infraction to Guides.<br/>
It is one of the first things I was told by a Guide friend that they<br/>
COULD NOT do. No spells, no fighting players, no interacting with the <br/>
world in other than talking at ALL.<br/>

&gt;Still I think the way they were treated was insulting, and losing their<br/>
&gt;guide status for one very minor infraction was overkill.  <br/>
