&gt; &gt; nice, ghoul lord at zone.  never seen that before.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Totally amazing. Just trying to think how you could possible pull that<br/>
&gt; off. The only way I could think to manage it would be to be bound on the<br/>
&gt; lower side by the zone line and gate out of a fight with him. At that<br/>
&gt; point the teleport code might kick in and he&#39;d teleport to you. Hmm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only other way I could see this would be someone with a ton of hp<br/>
&gt; and sow, and even then I couldn&#39;t see them making it all the way to the<br/>
&gt; zone unless the rest of the dungeon was picked clean.<br/>

My sister married a German. He complained he couldn&#39;t get a<br/>
good bagel back home. I said: ``Well, whose fault is that?&#39;&#39;<br/>
