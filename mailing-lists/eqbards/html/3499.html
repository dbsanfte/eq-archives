&gt;Just wanted to share my elation with the listserv that I made 20th level<br/>
&gt;last night!  I don&#39;t think I could have been as successful without all your<br/>
&gt;advice, thanks!<br/>

Congratulations, friend!!!!  Keep singing!<br/>
<br/>
I, myself, made 35th level last night, which I have learned is the second of<br/>
at least three &quot;hell levels&quot; where your experience is somehow &quot;watered down&quot;<br/>
to slow you down. 30th level was like this, but I am told 35th is worse, and<br/>
40th is worse still. Don&#39;t know anyone on my server to have reached 45th or<br/>
49th to tell me whether they are the same, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I have long awaited 35th for the ability to Track. To some is may sound<br/>
stupid, or trivial, but I think it&#39;s kinda cool and have been jealous of<br/>
rangers for it (since my wife plays one! hehehehe).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, again, Congrats!<br/>
