  Firstly, I don&#39;t recall asking you to post this on<br/>
the list here, and wasnt bringing it here<br/>
too...however, since you have made it known, perhaps<br/>
you should calm down and look at the facts.<br/>
<br/>
First, look at some later posts.  We bards ARE INDEED<br/>
Rogues too.  Playing Jokes is something we do.  There<br/>
is a particularly annoying (to me) wiz named Lomax on<br/>
my server, and he and I have had many arguments (in<br/>
char, and out).  When he went afk last night, and a<br/>
mob aggro&#39;d him (while medding), I pulled it off him. <br/>
Why?  Cause it was the right thing to do.  HE simply<br/>
had to go to the restroom.<br/>
<br/>
Why was I so nasty to the bought char?  For those of<br/>
us who EARNED those levels (and I DO have a character<br/>
who did, so being SCOLDED by the higherups isn&#39;t<br/>
likely to happen) its actually bothersome to see a<br/>
char bought.  I really think Verant should ban<br/>
accounts of people they can prove this was done to.<br/>
<br/>
However, back to the rogue thing.  DID I in ANY way<br/>
cause permenant harm to him?  No.  Will he have more<br/>
than a long walk to his corpse (Im guessing he WILL<br/>
have his songs, and finding a body is no trouble for<br/>
bards)?  No.  Did he learn a valuable lesson? <br/>
Certanly.  It&#39;s NOT A NICE WORLD WE LIVE IN.  Things<br/>
KILL you in Norrath.  Any newbie with a manual would<br/>
have bothered to /con it.  Would I DO this to a normal<br/>
newbie?  No...I normally give them all the assistance<br/>
I can.<br/>
  What I did, was done partially as a bardic prank. <br/>
My target WAS CERTAINLY chosen by his appearant buying<br/>
of the character.  Why?  Because I personally didnt<br/>
approve of it, and he was annoying me.<br/>
<br/>
I NEVER trained a horde of critters on him.  I never<br/>
targeted him.  All I did was suggest he say &quot;HI&quot; to a<br/>
giant.  If he was THAT NAIVE....he NEEDED that lesson.<br/>
 SO he lost some of the EXP he never earned in the<br/>
first place.  <br/>
Did I ask him to /consent me so I could help him get<br/>
his stuff back?  Nope.  That would have been stealing,<br/>
and wrong.  I just told him some fallacies that ANYONE<br/>
of his level should know to be false, and that ANYONE<br/>
who bothers to even BROWSE the manual would NEVER fall<br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
Now....I responded on this list, only because it was<br/>
taken here.  Please desist this thread from the list. <br/>
It wasnt MEANT to be posted here, and it violates<br/>
QUITE a bit of basic internet etiquette for you to<br/>
have posted it here.  <br/>
<br/>
My last words on this were said.<br/>
