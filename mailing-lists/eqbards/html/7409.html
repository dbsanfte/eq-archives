&gt;read on - you might actually be pleasantly surprised.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I must admit, I was...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So, to summarize:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Song: Bardic Binding Bellow<br/>
&gt;Level: 21<br/>
&gt;Casting Req&#39;s:  Mana, 200 (Self) + 100 Per group member, 800 Mana for full<br/>
&gt;group + Reagent (Enchanted electrum or something like that),<br/>
&gt;ore, etc. Possibly make a Zone Specific Reagent<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Stipulations: Can only be sung once per day, similar to Lay of Hands<br/>
&gt;Acquired: By multi-part quest, forcing the bard to travel to many zones<br/>
&gt;(thus preventing us from becoming Bind whores)<br/>
&gt;               Possible addendum to this.. make two spells.. the first being<br/>
&gt;               a Self-Only Bind that is bought at a merchant.  Still<br/>
&gt;               would use reagents, but would not have a casting restriction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               The Second Bind spell would be a Quest.  It would be group<br/>
&gt;               bind, but would difficult AND have a casting delay built in<br/>
&gt;               like lay of Hands, etc.  If you did it this way, you could<br/>
&gt;               even make the delay greater, say 2 days.  This would enable<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;               bard to be able to self-bind at any time, but only group bind<br/>
&gt;               on a limited basis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think this is an excellent idea.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the reagent should be a musical instrument ;)  But that&#39;s just me.<br/>
Of course, I&#39;ve been arguing long for giving NPCs bind-for-plat :P<br/>
