Slyde - I did kinda change guilds. Excalibur is a great guild, but just<br/>
never able to field enough folks of a similiar level to go do anything. It&#39;s<br/>
not that we were greedy or anything, just bored with the same zones, etc. So<br/>
several of our friends from Excal had left and joined or dual guilded some<br/>
time ago to VS. We found ourselves being more and more involved with Venator<br/>
Sapentia raids and they becoming the folks we looked for when we logged on<br/>
to see what we were going to do. It&#39;s difficult to not have the guildchat<br/>
when you raid with a guild alot so I retired as an officer of Excalibur and<br/>
have guilded my bard to VS. Klaget had already joined a couple weeks before<br/>
I did. My wiz and cleric are currently still guilded to Excalibur. It&#39;s a<br/>
tough call really, because we like the folks in both guilds alot.<br/>
<br/>
Darkfox - We were actually after the Procurator for a key to South and<br/>
hopefully a bard mask. We went in last night and got both! I didn&#39;t know a<br/>
kylong bp dropped, never seen one, although it makes sense with bracers,<br/>
arms, and legs dropping. I have the Trak bp so it&#39;s doubtful I would be<br/>
interested in a kylong bp. I am wearing a kylong bracer and the kylong legs<br/>
which everyone tells me look hideous since I got the SS bp. It looks<br/>
slightly better as an Erudite: green top and arms, pinkish red skirt, and no<br/>
bucket helm!<br/>
