&gt; How does this work?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been killing giant scarabs in Misty (got lvls 8,9 an 10<br/>
&gt; yesterday!!!!) and sometimes they seem to just give up the chase.  THey<br/>
&gt; are still alive (on my target bar)  but never show up...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you run too far from them, they give up (but still remember<br/>
you so they have a heightened aggro radius to you until you<br/>
zone).  The range at which they give up varies from mob to<br/>
mob.  Undead have a give-up radius too, but will attack any<br/>
target they stumble across regardless of you being tops on<br/>
their hate list.  So even if an undead is chasing you and you<br/>
are close enough that they won&#39;t give up on you, if it happens<br/>
to pass by another person, it will usually attack him instead<br/>
of continuing to chase you.  Not-so-nice players take<br/>
advantage of this to dump unwanted undead onto others.<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re pulling, sometimes you have to Selo-walk or<br/>
Selo-run backwards.<br/>
