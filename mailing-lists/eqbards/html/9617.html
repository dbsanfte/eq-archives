&gt; There was a change a while ago - I forget the nitty gritty.  It was was for<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t happen to follow UO, do you?  Origin announced<br/>
exactly what you describe about a month ago.  They just<br/>
finished up an item destruction program, where you got<br/>
&quot;tickets&quot; for every item you destroyed.  You could then turn<br/>
in X number of tickets for a prize.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; worn items, and that&#39;s it.  Assuming you have all your<br/>
&gt; &gt; inventory full of 10 slot backpacks and chock full of items,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s 160 items per character.  Call it 180 to account for<br/>
&gt; &gt; worn items.  Assume all 8 character slots are used in this<br/>
&gt; &gt; manner.  That&#39;s 1440 items per player.  Assume 5000 players<br/>
&gt; &gt; per server all doing this, and that&#39;s 7.2 million items as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; close-to-worst-case scenario.  If each item has 1k of data<br/>
&gt; &gt; associated with it, that&#39;s roughly 7 GB.  My PC&#39;s hard drive<br/>
&gt; &gt; is bigger than that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only 5000 per server?  That seems WAY low to me.  The active servers average<br/>
&gt; just under 2000 players simultaneos in peak times.  Verant says they have<br/>
&gt; 250,000 subscribers.  How many servers are there - 12?  If evenly<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; distributed that would be 20,000 per server.  But we know the users aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; evenly distributed.  And how many CHARACTERS on averager.  This database<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I assumed all 8 characters are used.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; discussion is based on characters not players.  How many characters does the<br/>
&gt; average player have.  How many people buy the game and have quit.  How long<br/>
&gt; do they stay before being purged.  So my estimate is (worse-case server)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 30,000 player accounts - and average of 4 characters - 120,000 characters -<br/>
&gt; So by my estimate we&#39;re adding 164 GB not 7.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not data we&#39;re adding.  This was a back of the<br/>
envelope calculation for the maximum size of the entire item<br/>
database.<br/>
<br/>
Given 260,000 players (which assumes nobody has quit), the<br/>
average per server would be 10,000.  Say you have twice that<br/>
for Fennin Ro - 20,000 players.  20,000 players * 8 chars *<br/>
180 items * 1k per item = 27.5 GB for the entire database.<br/>
<br/>
Now using the same assumptions, say we&#39;re going to add a<br/>
4 byte timestamp to each item (could probably get away with a<br/>
2 byte timestamp, but let&#39;s be fecetious).  That will increase<br/>
your database size by 107 MB, or 0.39%.  I suppose the hard<br/>
part would be recompiling the database to accomidate the extra<br/>
4 bytes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now even if is 7GB and not 164GB - comparing to your PC&#39;s hard disk to a<br/>
&gt; Database you&#39;re comparing apples to oranges.   My experience is with<br/>
&gt; commercial DBMS that support transactions and two-phase commits.  Verant I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure uses a properietary scheme that&#39;s tuned for speed  But regardless A 7<br/>
&gt; GB increase can be a HUGE problem.  We are expecting a seemless world where<br/>
&gt; everything seems to happen in real-time.  I&#39;ve worked with 7 GB databases<br/>
&gt; (and we&#39;re talking about a 7 GB increase to a much larger databases here)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, we&#39;re not talking about an increase.  We&#39;re talking<br/>
about the entire database being 7 GB.<br/>
