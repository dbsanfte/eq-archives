<div id="ygrps-yiv-431776062"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; oh did i mention it is 2h slashing? =P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You know, now that you mention it... some ranger about a month<br/>
  ago was trying to sell me a 2h axe.  I thought he was teasing<br/>
  me; not that I&#39;d want any 2h weapon for real use, but rather<br/>
  for novelity.  I shrug&#39;d it off.  I believe it was called a <br/>
  double bone bladed axe(?) or something of the sorts.  Apparently,<br/>
  BRD can use it.  Never really investigated further.<br/>
