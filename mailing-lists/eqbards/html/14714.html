<div id="ygrps-yiv-576543153">On a side note, I&#39;ve always been scared to death to play any area songs in<br/>
lower guk.  Is it indeed safe (well, as safe as one can be there) to do so?<br/>
 My impression is that I would piss off every unseen monster either above<br/>
or below me, getting my group killed.  Hehe, only area song i have ~ever~<br/>
done in there was Screech in Exe area, when my group got itself into a<br/>
tight situation, and needed to evac. <br/>
