<br/>
there&#39;s a female bard, to the left as you zone into west karana from qeynos<br/>
hills, standing near the first house in the cluster you come to.<br/>
to date, i have only gottent the warning about sergeant mcclusky (out in the<br/>
third tower of wk).  she apparently serves no other purpose (is not a<br/>
vendor, etc. and so on)<br/>
<br/>
to my knowledge, no one ever found Vhalen&#39;s girlfriend, but i have heard<br/>
rumors that the sk she ran off with is in the sewers of qeynos *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
the only others i could think of would be the ones in Temple of Sol Ro, the<br/>
vendors in HH and Erudin (are they bards???), and the mail bunch.<br/>
<br/>
I think (but not sure) that there was a bard in the Ferrott before the mail<br/>
runs, but now hands out mail &lt;- dunno about this one, maybe i&#39;m dreaming<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s all i can think of<br/>

3rd Rank (8th lvl) Enchanter<br/>

&gt; Well I&#39;ve certainly killed enough mobs in Mistmoore if thats the criteria.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve also done the mail runs on at least 30-40 occasions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Question: Does raising faction with The League of Antonican Bards<br/>
(increased<br/>
&gt; when killing Mistmoore mobs) raise faction with all three bard guilds?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, other than bard NPCs in the three guilds and the bard messengers<br/>
&gt; posted in or near all the city zones, what other bard NPCs are there in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; game?  I know of one in South Karana (Vhalen?) and one in the East<br/>
Freeport<br/>
&gt; tavern near the dock.  Off the top of my head I can&#39;t remember any more<br/>
bard<br/>
&gt; NPCs.  Anyone out there got a complete list of bard NPCs and where they<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; located?  They should be the first ones we check.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (to my knowledge).  If morning dew is in the game but hard to find, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the plan we implemented should have found it.  But based on our<br/>
negative<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; results, everyone came to the conclusion that Verant was incorrect in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; claiming morning dew was in the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now we have GZ telling us that Kelin&#39;s lute and the small brass<br/>
trumpet<br/>
&gt; &gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the game but hard to find.  Assuming these are acquired via a<br/>
quest,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would think that trying something similar to what the brewers tried<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; morning dew is the first step to discovering the secret.  I think we<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You also might need the correct faction.  Perhaps having<br/>
&gt; &gt; killed enough mobs in Mistmoore and delivered enough mail will<br/>
&gt; &gt; do it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
