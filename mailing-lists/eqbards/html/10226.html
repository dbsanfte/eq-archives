&gt; along the lines of not wanting to put in a hard level cap onitems. Why?<br/>
&gt; Because if somebody goes through a lot of trouble of doing a new quest or<br/>
&gt; killing some mob and gets a item he can&#39;t use why should he not be able to<br/>
&gt; use it on a new character?<br/>

using the item if he somehow got incredibly lucky/fortunate<br/>
and got the item early on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I already covered this.  There are proc&#39;ing level limits in<br/>
the game, some items are no-drop, and the planes are<br/>
off-limits until you&#39;re level 46 because people were running<br/>
in with level 1 characters to loot the items.  They may not<br/>
have made a statement on it, but they&#39;ve coded it into the<br/>
game.<br/>
