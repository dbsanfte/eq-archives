<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032190874">I notice the same thing too with my piercing.  I had to dump in 20/61<br/>
practice point, that I do not know what to do with, into piercing for the<br/>
skill to start going up.  I think it goes up faster if u hit rather than<br/>
missed.  It might go up even if missed but faster if hit.  After half a lvl<br/>
my piercing went from 30 to 75.  I hoped this help.<br/>

Bad news is you won&#39;t gain points fast until you begin to approach your max.<br/>
It appears that only sucesses or near sucesses gain you skill points from<br/>
what I&#39;ve observed.  John or JM correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I saw my skill<br/>
in 1HB slowly gain till it was within 15 points or so of max, then shoot<br/>
right up to max in no time, all the while fighting the same critters at the<br/>
same level.<br/>

Hello all!<br/>
	Well i got myself a Dirk , Love the stats , love the effects <br/>
.......now if the damn thing would just work right. My question is , how<br/>
long <br/>
did it take everyone out there to get your piercing skills up ? This is <br/>
mainly to the foolish people like me who didn&#39;t think to rotate weapons and <br/>
keep all skills maxed .....( whoops). I have been in a group and solo for a <br/>
day and a half now using my dirk, and my skill level is 7! ( still gotta go <br/>
to the guild and throw a point into pierce) So i have 2 more questions 1) if<br/>
<br/>
i throw a point or 2 in to pierce does it make leveling faster from that <br/>
point onward ? and 2) because pierce isn&#39;t the bards intial attack type , or<br/>
<br/>
perhaps its preffered weapon type ( is that worded ok?? , it might not be ) <br/>
does it make piercing harder to learn than 1h slash ??<br/>
Ok , many thanks .<br/>
