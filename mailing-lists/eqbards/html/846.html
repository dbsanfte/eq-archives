&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll let Jyzan or Mr. Kim or someone point you in the right direction as <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have any of the more descriptive lists linked from work (Jyzan, <br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; you update the eqvault list to be more detailed or something?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It has been updated, yes, up to level 20.  There are some errors in it<br/>
&gt;still (it says that Hymn and Chords only work on the pulse, when this<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t the case anymore) and some areas of debate (some people say<br/>
&gt;Warsong and Anthem stack and others don&#39;t) and I think there&#39;s even a<br/>
&gt;blatent instrument error (I think I said that the lament was a singing<br/>
&gt;skill song), but overall, it&#39;s pretty thorough.  The one that&#39;s floating<br/>
&gt;around this list as a .doc is quite good too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ack, I want to get back into EQ dammit! =P<br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t want to comment on things because I haven&#39;t played in <br/>
commercial yet (just moved and don&#39;t have all my things yet). I&#39;m not <br/>
totally keen on all the things that have changed since beta.<br/>
<br/>
I DO distinctly remember Chant of Battle NOT working with Anthem (Lord knows <br/>
I tried it!) at that time. I also kinda miss the speed attack combo (ok I <br/>
really missed it, but I got over it).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
