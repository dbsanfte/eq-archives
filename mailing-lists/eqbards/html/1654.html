 </span></blockquote>Well, maybe you are a bard that pumped most of their stats into<br/>
AGI and STA, instead of CHA like I and others did.  With 100 CHA,<br/>
my ability to solo is virtually NILL at level 13.  Sometimes even<br/>
blues give me a run for my money!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Well, frankly,<br/>
&gt; &gt;if you&#39;re grouping, you should be gaining experience faster.  <br/>
 <br/>
&gt; I gain so little exp in a group it isn&#39;t even funny. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only reason I&#39;m level 13 is because of grouping.  I did<br/>
most of my levelling by grouping with 1 or 2 others that were<br/>
roughly 2 or 3 levels above me.  When everything you attack is<br/>
red, you can&#39;t help but get a significant amount of xp.<br/>
I do believe that this happened before the &#39;bard = enemy #1&#39;<br/>
bug manifested itself, so that made a difference.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;And my final point of the night: (And here&#39;s where I expect to work on my<br/>
&gt; &gt;dodge skill:) I think Bards should be denied Plate Mail.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; When I do group, I find one of my main selling points is &quot;I can&#39;t dish out<br/>
&gt; the damage, but I sure can take it&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See my first point on placing mega stats into STA.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And in a<br/>
&gt; group, the combination of my platemail and ability to attract the attention<br/>
&gt; of the mobs, makes me a great tank, taking the damage whilst the<br/>
&gt; spellcasters dish it out. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bards are not tanks.  Sure, we can pretend, but that is not what<br/>
we were designed for.<br/>
<br/>
As for not wearing plate, I think that just fixing the bug that<br/>
places bards at the top of the s.list would not be enough compensation<br/>
for this serious restriction to our AC.  Druids can&#39;t wear this<br/>
sort of stuff, and get some decent defensive spells too.  However,<br/>
theirs stack (generally), but I can&#39;t twist 3 songs - lag and ping<br/>
too high.  So, increased defensive song effects (even if those<br/>
increased effects were just for the singer, and not for the rest<br/>
of the party) would help keep things balanced.<br/>
Otherwise we would be toast.<br/>
