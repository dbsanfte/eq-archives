&gt;got to the 49-50 Range (and Hit 51 pretty fast 49 and 50 are pretty easy to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>sure, they&#39;d be fine, as long as you were a good puller heh.  even if you weren&#39;t<br/>
that great a puller at first, you&#39;d be ok, as long as they were good at ghettomezzing<br/>
(root parking) if you got too many.  during the fight, the druids could each shoot<br/>
off one dot, dd as mana permits, the paladins can chain stun (may take some<br/>
communication), and you can basically do the pulling, depending on how well<br/>
the chain stunning went, i&#39;d twist hymn/nivs/largos, or hymn/nivs/haste, and mez<br/>
and/or charm if you got extras.  oh, and note that ghettomezzing only works on<br/>
melee types, not casters, heh.  if you get a caster, either they need to fight it<br/>
first or you need to mez it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;         For practice - to be honest - I&#39;m more concerned about the rest of the<br/>

&gt;and even Chardok zone (albeit with different groups often containing a<br/>
&gt;Shaman) and relying on Charm...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so it sounds like you&#39;re more worried about them assisting and the like.  have them<br/>
make a hotkey and tell the primary assist never to switch targets unless you tell<br/>
him to, heh.<br/>
