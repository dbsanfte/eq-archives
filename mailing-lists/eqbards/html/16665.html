<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171388203">Plus, although I missed Charming two Giants against each other (never had <br/>
the<br/>
patience to find two of them<br/>
at once), I&#39;m now Fear/Chaining single SGs, Specters and kobolds.  A little<br/>
tedious, but better than no<br/>
exp!  I fear/chained Terrorantula last night, even.  Note:  Fear has such a<br/>
small radius, that you have to<br/>
stand right *under* this spider to make it work.  ;)<br/>

I&#39;ve been soloing the giant skels and drakes in Rathe Mtns using the chains, <br/>
fear, DDD combo.  Works great as long as you dont lose track of your timing. <br/>
  Im thinking of trying it on cyclops, just to see if I can.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been playing around with charm on the giant skels.  (Never had the <br/>
guts to try it before now)  After watching a bard charming HG&#39;s solo, (first <br/>
time I&#39;ve ever seen this done) it inspired me to attempt it.  I do, however <br/>
see one major problem with this: He is constantly training other people in <br/>
the zone. Very not cool.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I grouped up with a necro in my guild and we killed cyclops <br/>
non stop.  I played hymn for him while he had his call of bones spell up, <br/>
and he was never out of mana.  DDD stacks with the necro DoT&#39;s, and his pet <br/>
would just cut through them like a hot knife through warm butter. Would have <br/>
like to try that on hill giants.<br/>
