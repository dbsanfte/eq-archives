<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879145660">Yes, I always twist Chant and Warsong when soloing, then when my group rolls<br/>
in I dump chant to mem Anthem, and go with Anthem/Hymn.  Either way I throw<br/>
in the odd bellow when soloing, or Chords when my group is fighting multiple<br/>
monsters.  The tanks love it when midway thru the fight all the monsters<br/>
suddenly ignore them and go after me.  Since I&#39;m generally untouched at that<br/>
point we all end up equally hurt much of the time which makes using Hymn to<br/>
heal up all that much more effective.  Nothing like adventuring with 3<br/>
rogues though and midway thru the fight suddenly having all the critters<br/>
doin the curly shuffle (You know, &#39;Hey that bard hurt me&#39;, turn to Kitasi,<br/>
rogue backstabs Legionnaire for 30, &#39;Hey that rogue hurt me&#39;, turn to rogue,<br/>
Pulse, &#39;Hey that bard hurt me&#39;, etc...)  Its a hoot!<br/>

&gt; though.... Does the first song that you get (Chant of<br/>
&gt; Battle) get better as you get better at singing etc? Or is<br/>
&gt; it just something that you use as a low level guy and<br/>
&gt; discard later?<br/>
<br/>
Because we only get one song per level (unlike spellcasters<br/>
who usually get 10+ spells every 4 or 5 levels), nearly all<br/>
our songs become better as you increase in level.  You will<br/>
use Chant early on, discard it around L10 (Anthem is better<br/>
for a party), then resurrect it in your 40s(?) when you get<br/>
Celerity.<br/>
<br/>
You may occasionally resurrect it in your middle levels for<br/>
the strength boost.  I twisted Chant and the Warsong with<br/>
Accelerando when I had to head back to town once almost 80 lbs<br/>
overweight.  Chant increased by str by 18 points, as did the<br/>
Warsong.  Those two picked up my running speed by quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could also use it while soloing (Athem does not<br/>
stack with Chant), twisted with Warsong...  Hmm... I wonder<br/>
why I never thought of that combo before...<br/>
