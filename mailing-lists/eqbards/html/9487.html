<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325252969">I sympathize with you entirely, the whole procedure is nothing less than a<br/>
miraculous feat of dexterity to pull off.  The key is to practice and then<br/>
practice some more...then when you think you have it down, go practice it<br/>
some more.  After all is said and done, expect to die now and then when<br/>
going up against a big mean baddy.  Did I mention practice?<br/>
<br/>
Outdoors you stay far away from your charmed pet and give yourself the 3<br/>
seconds to recharm as you see it turn on you and start running - then back<br/>
off again and put some space between you and your pet, charm has a good<br/>
distance to it.  Here is some ways to use it indoors (the majority of my<br/>
personal experience is here).<br/>
<br/>
Get rid of the hot key that says &quot;train&quot; and use it for something else more<br/>
important.  I have my keys like so in the 6th hotkey bank:<br/>
<br/>
#1: Charm Song<br/>
#2: Pet Guard Me<br/>
#3: Pet Follow Me<br/>
#4: Pet Back Off<br/>
#5: Target Pet<br/>
#6: Pet Attack Target<br/>
<br/>
In this fashion I have the whole routine worked out, target charm candidate<br/>
with F1 (I remapped my keys to switch default F8 to F1) then hit the &quot;1&quot;<br/>
key, as soon as I get the glazed over message I hit F1 again which targets<br/>
the nearest hostile, then I hit &quot;6&quot; to command the pet to attack, then when<br/>
the pet says &quot;attacking target&quot; I hit &quot;5&quot; to retarget the pet.  At this<br/>
point I back as far away as possible, hit shift-1, kick in another<br/>
appropriate song (heal, selos, clarity, whatever), hit shift-6 to go back to<br/>
the charm hotkey bank and about this time the mob comes unstuck and I repeat<br/>
the cycle again.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have been using this method in the ghost room in unrest pretty<br/>
successfully when my group accidentally pulls 3 or 4 mobs (bad bad idea to<br/>
use AE songs there so my choices are limited).  I found that if I charm a<br/>
mushroom man or if no mushroom man, a Festering Hag, a fight that might have<br/>
required an evac ends up in our favor nicely.  You may need to develop your<br/>
own routine for outdoor giant charming and include selo&#39;s in your hotkey<br/>
bank for easy access.  There is nothing like the satisfaction of seeing a<br/>
Festering Hag nuking dark tentacles or greater dark bones for 200 damage - I<br/>
could never come close to that just meleeing.  It is dangerous and can go<br/>
awry even so but I love it when a hag breaks charm and bum-rushes me,<br/>
flailing her arms as her hands begin to glow red and just as she is about to<br/>
whallop me, &quot;a festering hags eyes glaze over&quot; ha!<br/>
<br/>
Or this is another fun one, have the Mortuary Fungus cast that nasty mort<br/>
drowsy spell on a skeletal monk and watch it stand there like a moron while<br/>
we pound away at it.  My favorite message in this instance is the &quot;a<br/>
mortuary fungus casts a spell but you are protected&quot; HA! That is mort drowsy<br/>
putting most of the hostile mobs in the room off to narcoleptic dreamland.<br/>

&gt;   Hallaluia Baby !!! Last night made level 28 and ran right <br/>
&gt; out to play<br/>
&gt; with my new charm song.<br/>
&gt;   I mean visions of Sand Giants dropping at my feet ! Now Moonflower<br/>
&gt; Bllue on Cazic-Thule is no fool. You don&#39;t get to level 28 without<br/>
&gt; learning something and not only that she has been reading this list<br/>
&gt; since nearly the beginning and even formulated it into her text for<br/>
&gt; beginning Bard&#39;s, &quot;Guns and Roses&quot;. But this time James, John <br/>
&gt; Gregg and<br/>
&gt; the boys have not come through. You left out the critical <br/>
&gt; information on<br/>
&gt; key board set up. Moon decided to practice with Lesser Fey Orcs and<br/>
&gt; spiders. Hot Keys on the Number pad bottom row read &quot;pet attack&quot;, &quot;Pet<br/>
&gt; guard me&quot; and &quot;Pet back off&quot;, the second row was #4 Charm, #5 <br/>
&gt; Selos and<br/>
&gt; #6 ...&quot;Train Coming&quot; I think.<br/>
&gt;   F1,F1 to call up pet and Num Lock to auto run and mouse to steer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  She practiced and practiced. She found usually Charm would <br/>
&gt; last 2 to 3<br/>
&gt; rounds , some times 4 but hunting and pecking , hands <br/>
&gt; crossing... I mean<br/>
&gt; if they had been Sand Giants she be level 27 in a heart beat. <br/>
&gt; Getting a pet is no problem. Praying you bogus &quot;Sand Giant&quot; AKA Orc<br/>
&gt; Centurion at your side keeps his cool while you fumble with targeting<br/>
&gt; another SG Cent ( the target SG is lost because your on auto <br/>
&gt; run getting<br/>
&gt; the first SG as a pet) &quot;aim, click, keypad 1, F1,F1 OUCH !!! <br/>
&gt; sucker hit<br/>
&gt; me !! ,aim, click, Charm, charm, aim, click on target, key <br/>
&gt; pad 1 attack,<br/>
&gt; f1, f1, Charm... &quot;hummm, why isn&#39;t pet attacking ?&quot;... ok, <br/>
&gt; Pet guard me.<br/>
&gt; Run near target... whooooaa, forgot to turn on Selos !!! OUCH <br/>
&gt; OUCH OUCH<br/>
&gt; !!! Thank heavens they are green Cents ! What the !!! 2 bubbles gone ?<br/>
&gt; Target Cent has a name ? Chief !!!... Run song...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    And so it goes.<br/>
&gt;    It would be really instructive if one of you gentlemen <br/>
&gt; could take me<br/>
&gt; and other readers on a walk thru as above on what keys and what you do<br/>
&gt; to make use Charm successful. It is the most difficult task Moonflower<br/>
&gt; has met yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Thanks<br/>
