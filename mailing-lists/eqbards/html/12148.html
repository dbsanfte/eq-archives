<b>Subject:</b> programmable game pad <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289675711">A few days / weeks ago there was a brief discussion on using a programmable game pad to assist in twisting songs... (significantly reduce &quot;button mashing&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Since i almost always play on my laptop, anything that improves the keyboard layout is of interest to me.  Could someone send me or post additional information.  I bought the Sidewinder Game pad pro yesterday and can not seem to get eq to recognize it. (not even for mouse movement).  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
