<div id="ygrps-yiv-569761752">I agree with this response.  Stratics has a couple of problems IMHO.  <br/>
<br/>
1.  their site is a pain in the rear to navigate.  Everything is hidden under<br/>
ambiguous headings.<br/>
<br/>
2.  most of their information is pretty accurate and detailed--if this was<br/>
still eq beta 4.  I would even go so far as the first couple of months of<br/>
release.  they do *not* consistently keep any of their EQ content updated.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, it would be unfair to bury your site in that mire...it is too valueable<br/>
to be filed away 15 links down on a disorganized website.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t trying to sound real harsh...but i guess it came across that way :( <br/>
sorry.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The only problem I have with it is that Stratics hasn&#39;t kept up at all<br/>
&gt;on EQ, with a lot of their content and reference pages still unchanged<br/>
&gt;since beta. As long as their hosting wasn&#39;t exclusive I guess there&#39;d be<br/>
&gt;no downside but it wouldn&#39;t be very good to see the song list locked<br/>
&gt;away on a site that hardly anyone goes to due to it&#39;s mostly out of date<br/>
&gt;info.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Check their bard song list, hidden away under strategy and<br/>
&gt;statistics(tm)-&gt;class articles-&gt;bard spell list. They have 20 songs.<br/>
&gt;I guess it&#39;s nice that they are looking for a better list now but my<br/>
&gt;question would be; why, after over a year of total neglect, are they<br/>
&gt;bothering?<br/>

&gt;&gt; They are interested in hosting the Song Analysis on their network.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; consider the Song Analysis to be not just mine, but all of yours as well. As<br/>
&gt;&gt; it would not be what it is without the combined wisdom of all the wonderful<br/>
&gt;&gt; bards on this mailing list and on the Concert Hall message board.  Your<br/>
&gt;&gt; opinions on this matter mean a lot to me, so please let me know what your<br/>
&gt;&gt; feelings are.<br/>
