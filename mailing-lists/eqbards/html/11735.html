<b>Subject:</b> RE: Group growth speed bump? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980850286">Same thing here, spent 4 weeks at 35 and watched a buddy go from 36-44 in<br/>
that same time period.  At least now that I am at this level there are no<br/>
restrictions on who I group with above me.  <br/>
<br/>
Got XP with a level 50 Wizzy who I found soloing Spectres and SGs in Oasis<br/>
the other night after he agreed to let me join for the sake of pursuing<br/>
lambent stones.  Additionally, level 25&#39;s are still able to group with me if<br/>
I am the upper level group member.  Thats a nice range of choices for<br/>
grouping and opens up a lot of doors IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
There is definitely a major speed bump at 35th however, and it seems to<br/>
break a lot of players.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, after the hell that was 35, is the 36 song Celerity useful in<br/>
any way?<br/>

&gt; Yes - I saw kinda the same thing.  My regular group zoomed <br/>
&gt; away when I got<br/>
&gt; stuck in level 35.  There were actually 2 problems. They were <br/>
&gt; a few lev&#39;s<br/>
&gt; above me (high 30&#39;s & lo 40&#39;s while I was 34) wanted to camp <br/>
&gt; lower guk for<br/>
&gt; items (which meant very, very, very slow xp for me.)  And <br/>
&gt; they played more<br/>
&gt; hours than me. By the time I was out of 35 (3 weeks) they <br/>
&gt; were 45+.  Now I<br/>
&gt; am a bub off 39 and they are all 50&#39;s. &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, yes for various reasons, regular groups can get broken <br/>
&gt; up.  It&#39;s quite a<br/>
&gt; heartbreak when it happens.<br/>

&gt; 		My regular group is going through an <br/>
&gt; distressing time right<br/>
&gt; now...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		The leader, who encouraged/dragged us through <br/>
&gt; Blackburrow,<br/>
&gt; Crushbone,<br/>
&gt; 		Chessboard, Unrest, and now Mistmoore gets bored very<br/>
&gt; quickly.  He wants to<br/>
&gt; 		see the exp bar move & wants to go where he hasn&#39;t gone<br/>
&gt; before.  There is<br/>
&gt; 		now doubt about the hi risk, hi reward thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		I just made 28, but most of the group is 33 - <br/>
&gt; 36.  It seems<br/>
&gt; like around 30<br/>
&gt; 		members get real shy about what they are <br/>
&gt; willing to try.  I<br/>
&gt; think we lost<br/>
&gt; 		our ranger last night, due to our leader wanting to move<br/>
&gt; past the torture<br/>
&gt; 		room?  Not a game issue, but ya&#39;ll see the same thing?<br/>
