&gt; Yeah, I&#39;ve got doubles.  I&#39;ve been the only bard around for a lot of these<br/>
&gt; runs.  The BP just dropped this weekend, I was ecstatic.  Think we only<br/>
&gt; pulled about 3 banshees that night, and it dropped on the 2nd one.  Maestro<br/>
&gt; was also kind enough to give me an evensong that same night (which was<br/>
&gt; perfect since I already had the six note)  It was the luckiest night for a<br/>
&gt; bard ever I think.  We only got about 4 drops total, and I got 2 of them.<br/>
&gt; They really need to re-tune this zone, everyone is getting a little upset<br/>
&gt; with the drop rate (well, except the clerics since there seems to be about<br/>
&gt; 20 times the number of their armor dropping mobs than everyone elses)<br/>

tuned it thinking &quot;16 hour respawn in Fear, 2 hour respawn for<br/>
wanderers in Hate, make stuff in Hate drop 1/8th as often as<br/>
in Fear.&quot;  That makes sense if you want to cap the rate at<br/>
which these items enter the game world as a whole.  From an<br/>
individual standpoint, since the difficulty of the mobs in<br/>
Hate and Fear are roughly the same, you end up getting much<br/>
fewer drops in Hate than in Fear.<br/>
<br/>
Put another way, Hate has the ability to support a lot more<br/>
people than Fear.  But since it&#39;s not camped like LGuk or<br/>
SolB, we&#39;re nowhere near saturating it.  Unfortunately, the<br/>
drops are tuned assuming saturation.<br/>
