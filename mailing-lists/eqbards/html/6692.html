<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-127972610">We&#39;re not a second class class, my group was killing gnomes last night<br/>
(they&#39;re so cute makes you want to kill em) but anyways, to the point...<br/>
Our tactic is our druid would snare, i would then charm to clear the hatred<br/>
of the druid. While it was charmed our rogue would disarm the guard. When it<br/>
became uncharmed, it would bee line for me, but i&#39;d play fear song and the<br/>
clerics were stunning it, never in these fights we&#39;d lose over a bubble of<br/>
health, then after fight i reduce down time.    I went afk for about half an<br/>
hour last night and the group was practically crying for my return, they<br/>
were getting beat down really bad in my absence.  When i got back they were<br/>
like a bunch of junkies that just got  a good fix (mana regen)<br/>
<br/>
Later on that night i was speaking with one of the clerics for over an hour<br/>
and he couldnt beleive how much bards rocked more once they got the mana<br/>
regen song, he couldnt beleive how much more i was pulling my weight now. It<br/>
felt good to finally feel needed in the group.  But back to the fight, the<br/>
snare, fear and stun are great tactic for wide open spaces and our rogue<br/>
loved it as it was great for his backstabs.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But the fact is in the EQ world we are becoming woefully underpowered.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I disagree, I have yet to see some manner in which I am &quot;underpowered&quot; I<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; okay solo (once I figured out how) I do over 1000pts damage in 36 seconds<br/>
&gt; (on a pull of 5 mobs) I give our group a major decrease in down time. I am<br/>
&gt; just not seeing it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Case in point the new SOW problem, the Z-axis bug, and there are more.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; fact is I love being a bard because of WHAT a bard is.. not because of<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; Verant made the bard.  It is evident that bards are being treated as a<br/>
&gt; second class, class.  What other class has had their spell deliberatly<br/>
&gt; placed as lesser value?  Our cancelling SOW was a fluke.. SoW overpowering<br/>
&gt; Accel was not an accident.  And WHY would you prefer SOW to Accel?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh pshaw, it&#39;s a bug, it&#39;s clearly a bug. They have a poorly modeled speed<br/>
&gt; data structure and they keep tweeking it (I can almost visualize it now<br/>
&gt; after all these changes). It&#39;s broke, it will be fixed. Petition it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; bard only weapons.  I would like to see the quest system fixed.. I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; see some more special items for bards<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; agreed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; .  I&#39;d like to see some more useful songs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to figure out all th euses for the songs I have...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;And I&#39;ld like to see them stop nerfing us without reguard to the results.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have yet to see proof it is an intentional nerf. As I said, petition it.<br/>
