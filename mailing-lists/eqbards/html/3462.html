<div id="ygrps-yiv-912627886">SoW doesn&#39;t affect what your character can do, other than kiting, only how<br/>
long it takes.  Bind definitely affects where you can adventure.  Ever seen<br/>
anyone in Upper Guk who the mobs weren&#39;t all green to?  You can bet they<br/>
were either an evil race or a caster.  Its a five zone run for any<br/>
non-caster good race, far too dangerous, untill nearly everything in Guk is<br/>
green to you.  Believe me I will never play another character who does not<br/>
get bind, period.  It is way too limiting.  I left Erudin with very little<br/>
exploration because there was literally no one there who could bind me, even<br/>
to the city!  I&#39;ve likewise had to wait over an hour just to get bound in<br/>
Kaladim because there was no one around who could bind me.  Of course had I<br/>
been a caster I was certainly high enough, 14th level to bind myself both<br/>
times.  I went to Guk, looked around and left.  Its too far to run when<br/>
everything around will cause a train and give no xp, except for a few<br/>
critters in the interior who are red.  If I was even a 12th level mage type<br/>
I would have stayed since the run would be measured in seconds, not half<br/>
hours.  Pure and simple, on average one death in Guk would take up my entire<br/>
evening of gaming and as a bard I run as fast as anyone.  That is an<br/>
imbalance, not a class distinction.<br/>

I don&#39;t know, if I thought about it I&#39;m sure I could come up with some<br/>
perfectly reasonable argument that my magician should get SoW at lvl<br/>
5...just for himself.  But he never does.  And it sucks.  My bard never gets<br/>
bind.  That sucks, too.  But I&#39;d rather they never got each other&#39;s<br/>
abilities.<br/>

&gt; Hate to bring this up again, but we Bards seem more like the semi-caster<br/>
&gt; shamans and clerics than the Paladins and Shadowknights.  I don&#39;t see why<br/>
