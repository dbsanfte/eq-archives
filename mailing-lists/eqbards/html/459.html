<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730113745">I have seen several mentions of this song being &#39;useless&#39;, etc. Actually <br/>
several of my spellcasting friends tell me that it will cause their man to <br/>
regen a bit faster. Now it does not perform like the high level song of <br/>
course, but many of my friends swear by it. We noticed this in beta and it <br/>
was widely debated, but many have told me they see a difference. Next time <br/>
you are in a group, try it while the casters are medding and see if they can <br/>
tell a difference.<br/>
