<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086482411">Okay, I need to throw this one out to you high-level Bards ;)  <br/>
We had confirmed some time ago that the Lute of the Gypsy Princess has no<br/>
special effect on stringed songs, however, I am getting several people<br/>
telling me otherwise.  Can we perchance get some tests or something?  I<br/>
hate to be misinformed :P<br/>
