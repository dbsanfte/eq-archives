<div id="ygrps-yiv-15975937">In FV fighting the giants I was in this group:<br/>
Paladin<br/>
Paladin<br/>
Paladin<br/>
Paladin<br/>
Bard<br/>
Bard<br/>
<br/>
The higher bard sang mana song in down time, and anthem, binding, ? in<br/>
combat.<br/>
<br/>
I (being 31 at the time) used my mandolin all the time, singing hymm, chords<br/>
and psalm...<br/>
<br/>
The xp was great since there was no downtime, as the paladins rotating<br/>
pulling while the other 3 healed and meditated.  They used stuns to help<br/>
control damage if we got a big pull...</div>
