<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231628188">From how you describe the situation, I would guess that you were unknowingly<br/>
using an exploit.  I imagine the other Bard was one of the one&#39;s on the<br/>
steps?  (I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call it an exploit, tho, since I believe the word<br/>
&quot;exploit&quot; implies &quot;intent&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unfortunate that Verant can&#39;t fix this pathing bug, even though they&#39;ve<br/>
known of it for a long time now.  It does make it impossible to fight in the<br/>
temple if attacked without exploiting unless every member of your group<br/>
stands within melee range.  Obviously this is impractical.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
camped with a group in the halls for this reason alone.  Pulling to the<br/>
bottom or pulling to the top seem to be the only ways around this.  It&#39;s the<br/>
players who knowingly camp the halls and abuse the bug that bother me.  1<br/>
wizard and 1 mage (w/o pet) standing in the corner nuking a mob standing on<br/>
the stairs are definately &quot;knowingly&quot; using the exploit.  3 tanks engaging a<br/>
mob in the hallway and 1 cleric standing behind are technically exploiting<br/>
in that the cleric could never possibly be attacked, but may not be<br/>
knowingly abusing the bug.  While they might wonder why the cleric is not<br/>
getting attacked, if it was their first time there, they would really have<br/>
no way of knowing.  This is the reason I jumped in this thread in the first<br/>
place.  To educate anyone who did not know of this bug, so they would know<br/>
what they were doing if and when the situation came up.<br/>

&gt; After reading all the posts about the Cazic exploit, I&#39;m trying to figure<br/>
&gt; out if the reason I didn&#39;t take any damage was because either 1) I was<br/>
