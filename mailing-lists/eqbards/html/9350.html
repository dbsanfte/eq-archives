<b>Subject:</b> RE: Testing LotGP and Kedge Keep was Observations: Uppe r & Lower Guk <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281260755">Ok, I did some testing last night and confirm John&#39;s observations.  Seems<br/>
like Guardian is great for stacking with other songs but NOT the primary<br/>
anti-magic song to play.<br/>
<br/>
Some results:<br/>
<br/>
Guardian only: MR 66  with MM Drum 90<br/>
Elemental only: MR 66  with MM Drum 90<br/>
Stacked only: MR 85 with MM Drum 136<br/>
<br/>
The other reason I had for testing was a ranger friend recently got a Lute<br/>
of the Gypsy Princess (LotGP which Lyssa Catalog Libaretto reveals as:<br/>
Mynthis Lute) in a trade and was trying to determine it&#39;s worth (maybe he<br/>
would sell it - any clue what is fair price? someone mentioned 200pp).  So,<br/>
I said this new patch maybe has changed what it does and we went to test.<br/>
Sadly, it looks like it has no special powers for a 35 bard in hymn or<br/>
chords.<br/>
<br/>
Chords: no instrument 6; lute 13; LotGP 13<br/>
Hymn: no instrument 13; lute 20; LotGP 20<br/>
<br/>
Later, my group tried to go to Kedge Keep - get equipped for underwater<br/>
breathing and swim due East from Unrest - stay on the bottom and look for<br/>
the broken pillars - reminiscent of Najena. <br/>
<br/>
We (at least most if us) zoned in and were greeted by a &quot;stiletto piranha&quot; -<br/>
conned red to a 36 ranger and blue to a 40 SK (presumably put right there at<br/>
he zone to eat solo artists).  Chomp chomp - we killed him - long melee.<br/>
Have your sta song loaded - swimming and fiting will burn sta like crazy.<br/>
We saw some other fishies to fight and they were blue cons to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Our enchanter could not zone in - presumably her new files were corrupted in<br/>
the down load or some such.  And a high lev guild was taking over the place<br/>
and would soon own the dungeon so we left to return another time. <br/>

		Unless it was changed it yesterday&#39;s patch, Guardian gives<br/>
the<br/>
		same MR as Elemental and Purifying.  I&#39;ve been tracking this<br/>

		Guardian has the advantage of stacking with certain other<br/>
		songs (mainly Elemental and Purifying and so far all of the<br/>
		Psalm series) and giving a bigger AC boost.  A couple levels<br/>
		ago, I&#39;d go from 45 to 90 MR playing Elemental, and from 90<br/>
to<br/>
		135 MR playing Guardian on top of that.<br/>
