<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665391847"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I mainly lurk on this list but I feel the time is right for me to say<br/>
&gt; something:<br/>
&gt; On Monday Night my Guild Noble Warriors of Norrath went to Perma for a bit<br/>
&gt; of hunting/camping, I as a young bard had visions of us leaving loaded to<br/>
&gt; the gills with Cryst-blades, icygreaves, silvery axes and other assorted<br/>
&gt; plunder.....<br/>
&gt; Our party formed up in the hall I sang my invis song and we walked up the<br/>
&gt; ladder into the flag room, then someone moved out of range and became<br/>
&gt; visible.LOADING.....PLEASE WAIT<br/>
&gt; Ran back re-mem&#39;d songs and started CR all went well, moved back in this<br/>
&gt; time to the room with the Priest spawn...No AOE songs just Bellow,Amthem,<br/>
&gt; Healing,Jig for our fighter now and then(long fights), and of course<br/>
&gt; Elemental and Gardians for priest fights and every now and then the crack<br/>
&gt; of my dual whips.<br/>
&gt; Then we got a tell from our enchanter(he was late) saying he was incoming<br/>
&gt; to us. He arrived /yelling for help with every gobby from the entrance to<br/>
&gt; the flag room chasing him, he cast Mez, he died....... Now was my turn to<br/>
&gt; show the power of the bard!<br/>
&gt; BTW our group was bard=me, fighter,shaman,ranger,monk, and the now dead<br/>
&gt; enchanter...<br/>
&gt; I whipped out my lute and began to play Lullabye, head nodding all around<br/>
&gt; :-), i was shaking so badly I could barly type&quot; Attack one at a time and<br/>
&gt; HEAL me!!&quot;.  About 5 min later I stood in the middle of the room with a<br/>
&gt; ring of dead Gobbies all around me 57HP left and my party at almost full<br/>
&gt; health.  I was estatic :-)))))). my party was in awe, the enchanter was<br/>
&gt; pissed( he died remember). n Then it happend the words that everyone fears<br/>
&gt; &quot;TRAIN, GET OFF THE TRACKS&quot; about 15 sec later our monk falls into the<br/>
&gt; room bleeding from several deep cuts and falls dead. 5 sec later more<br/>
&gt; Gobbies then I thought were in Perma boil into the room all looking for a<br/>
&gt; crunchy Bard snack.....Lullybye back up....nods from everyone.....NO AGGGG<br/>
&gt; the Priest RESISTED!!!!!!!! . &quot;ZONE, RUN NOW, LEAVE ME I&#39;LL HOLD THEM!!&quot; I<br/>
&gt; yell to my party. Everyone who can runs for the<br/>
&gt; zone.....LOADING.....Please Wait<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I ask you what went wrong? where are my Icy greaves? where is my<br/>
&gt; Silvery Axe? What the hell is The Tome of the Wheel?<br/>
&gt; If ye can answer any of these questions please do :-)<br/>
&gt; Thanks for letting me share my time in perma with ye<br/>
&gt; Just so ya know I had fun it was the first time I&#39;ve been scared in a long<br/>
&gt; time, in this game<br/>

 </span></blockquote>		Your icy greaves and silvery axe are in the room that the<br/>
train most likely started in ;)  Don&#39;t know about the Tome of the Wheel.<br/>
<br/>
	Not too sure where you were fighting.  You said near the preist, do<br/>
you mean the preacher room?  never seen a train come through there.  If you<br/>
were near the flag room, I know what happened.  Some group (or solo artist)<br/>
was trying the king room and brought the train with him.  One thing you want<br/>
to tell your group (assuming you&#39;re fighting in the flag room)  is go into<br/>
the little alcove near the far right hand side of that room.  Then start up<br/>
your invis song, and wait out the train.  This isn&#39;t a guaranteed solution,<br/>
on occasions, depending on the train they might see through your invis, but<br/>
it&#39;s worked for me far more often than not.<br/>
