&gt; Really? I thought they pretty much always attacked their charmer. But<br/>
&gt; perhaps the smell of a kill might frenzy them more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup.  I would say it *is* impossible to pull a mob off someone<br/>
who&#39;s almost dead.  I was fighting in Cazic and we&#39;d beaten a<br/>
lizard to about 1/4 life.  Suddenly it turned around, ran to<br/>
another group fighting, hit one of them once killing him, then<br/>
ran back to continue its fight with us.  Apparently it saw the<br/>
guy was almost dead and that overrode all hatred it had for<br/>
us even though the guy had never done anything to it, so it<br/>
ran over and killed him.<br/>

&gt; we were plummeling it, it RAN around like crazy until it fount that<br/>
