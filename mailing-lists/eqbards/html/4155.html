<div id="ygrps-yiv-775492875"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I know if you give a necro&#39;s pet a weapon after a certain level, they get<br/>
&gt;really upset - the pet is &#39;nerfed&#39; compaired to the damage it would do with<br/>
&gt;the weapon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmmm, this smells like an exploit fighting harder skele&#39;s to me, or does it<br/>
&gt;work differently?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The main problem is that a necro can&#39;t command his pet to unwield, there&#39;s<br/>
two problems with this:<br/>
<br/>
Magic-Onlys -- If you give a higher level pet (one that has the innate<br/>
ability to hit magic-only creatures) a rusty weapon, it will no longer be<br/>
able to hit magic-only critters.<br/>
<br/>
Speed -- When an npc wields a weapon it takes the best weapon speed from<br/>
either it&#39;s hands or the weapon, and the best dmg for either it&#39;s hands or<br/>
the weapon.  So you can&#39;t slow a creatures attacks down by giving it a slow<br/>
weapon.  Nor can you decrease the damage by giving a skeleton a rusty<br/>
weapon.  The gripe pet owners have is that if you give my pet a longsword,<br/>
and I wanted to give him a dagger, I can&#39;t get him to unwield the sword in<br/>
favor of the weapon.</div>
