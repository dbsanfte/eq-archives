<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010750136">Spelling error then, what I meant was that I was using the buff song (whatever<br/>
it is called) and they kill me for no odd reason, I did not have Chords of<br/>
Dissonance on, I can assure you of that.  But the strangest thing is that they<br/>
don&#39;t immediately kill me, and only particular guards are aggressive to me (like<br/>
one guard with ONE name, maybe two).  I was standing around for awhile, and I<br/>
think perhaps whatever I had attacked might have been drawn to guards and done<br/>
its little area effect damage thing, though it was off at the time.  But what<br/>
puzzles me is the fact that I will return to guard area, after no combat and<br/>
healing up for up to 5 mins, and a guard will come and lop my head off for no<br/>
particular reason.  I am definitely reporting it as a bug, the same thing<br/>
happened to my monk when he attacked an orc near guards.  (&quot;Guard says:&quot;Time to<br/>
die an orc raider&quot; Guard slashes you for 100 damage You die).<br/>

&gt; The level two song Chords of Dissonance is NOT a buff song, it&#39;s an Area of<br/>
&gt; Effect DAMAGE song.  The guards attacked you because you attacked THEM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Diety has a strong bearing on a lot of factions, though choosing one of the<br/>
&gt; good gods doesn&#39;t hurt you much with followers of other good gods.  Karana<br/>
&gt; worshipers and Marr worshipers get along just fine, for instance.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  For those quick browsers of messages, here is my warning.  I used the<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; &gt;level attack song alternating it mainly with the level 2 buff song when<br/>
&gt; fighting<br/>
&gt; &gt;in and around my home town of Kelethin.  Occasionally, when I run back to<br/>
&gt; town<br/>
&gt; &gt;(NEVER still singing my attack song), a guard will kill me for no apparent<br/>
&gt; &gt;reason.  Maybe it thinks I attacked another PC if he or she happened to run<br/>
&gt; by,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but I really don&#39;t know.  I fear that I have lost faction with my town,<br/>
&gt; though I<br/>
&gt; &gt;receive no messages about it.  Shopkeepers now look at me apprehensively,<br/>
&gt; except<br/>
&gt; &gt;for my guild of course.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Anyway, on to my question.  How much does a diety effect your actual<br/>
&gt; abilities<br/>
&gt; &gt;and inter-race relations?  I play a Wood Elf bard, and have enjoyed it<br/>
&gt; immensly,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but chose my diety as Tunare for fear of fraction problems.  I roleplay my<br/>
&gt; &gt;character as a romantic, so naturally Erolisi Marr (sp?) seems like a good<br/>
&gt; &gt;choice, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effects on others.  Would love to hear from<br/>
&gt; &gt;another bard who has tried more than one diety perhaps.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Laeaus, Wood Elf Bard level...(sigh)...3<br/>
