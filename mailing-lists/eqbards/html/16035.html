 </span></blockquote>I *think* I put about a lot of training points into Dual Weild, not doing<br/>
trades I I didn&#39;t have much else to use them on and Dual Weild is a huge<br/>
event after all that wimpy thrashing around, so I wanted to be up to speed<br/>
as soon as possible. THe next one you will want to dump a lot in is safe<br/>
fall, and you have some levels to go for that.<br/>
You want your fastest weapon in your primary hand and your bigun in your off<br/>
hand as that gives you the most chances to dual wield. At 25 I am *still*<br/>
using a dragoon Dirk and PGT, though it is getting a bit long in the tooth<br/>
(and mostly now I use all instrument attack)  it is perfect for 17-24. Even<br/>
if you don&#39;t get a PGT get a dragoon dirk for your primary weapon, even when<br/>
you stop using it you can put it in your throwing slot for it&#39;s bonuses, and<br/>
it&#39;s numbers are actually better than your longsword. Don&#39;t bother with the<br/>
tenticle whip, though a barbed one would be fine.<br/>
