<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049691247">Are the darkwood staves lore?<br/>
<br/>
My other char is a monk, and there&#39;s been rumors of new blunt weapons being<br/>
issued for monks (current ones suck in comparison to our hands), but the<br/>
darkwood staves sound like they might be worthwhile getting, if just to get<br/>
my 1hblunt skill up (it&#39;s at 3 right now I think.. hehe).Any idea what the<br/>
weight is on them?<br/>

If you&#39;re able to get a lambent stone you can hand it to some guy in the<br/>
temple of solusek ro (sorry forgot his name) for a darkwood staff. 5/28<br/>
magic (cracked is 5/32 non magical). This shall be a good start (not that<br/>
powerful but still fast and usable - magical). </span></blockquote></div>
