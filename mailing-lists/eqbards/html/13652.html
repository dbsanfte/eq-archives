<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-353341088">I reported this to Verant and even caught a L50 cleric exploiting it<br/>
(petitioned, got a GM in 5 mins that was going to investigate, 2 hours later<br/>
said cleric still tooling away unhampered... so, it must be okay to do and<br/>
it will certainly help you out).<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in the king room and fear a mob, it goes haulin&#39; butt (like I<br/>
really need to see more goblin crack) towards the gated trestles, opens the<br/>
smaller first, stops, turns, opens the larger second, runs to the facing<br/>
wall then despawns.<br/>
<br/>
Every single time.<br/>
<br/>
This would be useful if, say, you&#39;re camping twink goods but don&#39;t feel like<br/>
killing green stuff that didn&#39;t spawn visible goodies or those annoying<br/>
placeholders.  This would also rock for us bards with AE fear... never worry<br/>
about getting swarmed while you&#39;re doing the king room ever again!<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, I&#39;m very bitter.  The aforemented L50 cleric is a member of the most<br/>
powerful guild on my server - you would expect more, but then again... that<br/>
would be one possible explanation for how you become the most powerful<br/>
guild, eh? *argh*)<br/>

PS: Going with the quantity over quality motif for getting out of hell<br/>
levels, what&#39;s the scoop for 40th?  30 and 35 can both easily (less than 2<br/>
days for each) be slogged through in cazic - 30th for gators, 35th gators<br/>
still work, but I found AoF to be a little more fun - looted my own claws!<br/>
=).  The key is to not have pride... What?  You&#39;re in cazic again?!!? Leave<br/>
the luggage alone! -Yeah yeah yeah, shuddup and come join me. P</div>
