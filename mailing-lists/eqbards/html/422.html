<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880460092">I have a question on twisting songs.  I&#39;m a 8th level bard with a DEX rating<br/>
of 95 and singing/intrument skills maxed out for my level (45).  I have<br/>
noticed when I attempt to twist I miss a lot of notes and as a result don&#39;t<br/>
reap the full benefits of twisting.  Is the ability to twist songs based on<br/>
your DEX rating, your singing skill, or both?  Does the level of the song<br/>
also come into play?  For example, as an 8th level bard with a singing skill<br/>
of 45, at this stage in my career I may not be skilled enough to twist the<br/>
6th and 8th level songs successfully.  However, down the road when my<br/>
singing skill improves to 70 I would have no problem with that combo.  At<br/>
that point, twisting the 12th and 13th level songs would give me trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time I use a weapon in combat so should the DEX rating even come<br/>
into play since I&#39;m not playing an instrument.  When I created my character,<br/>
I put points into the standard bard stats such as STR, DEX, and CHR.  I also<br/>
put a few into AGI to improve my AC.  Should I have put more into DEX than I<br/>
did? I enjoy playing with this character and will continue to play them.  I<br/>
ask this question because if I will never be good at twisting due to my DEX<br/>
rating, I will just play one song at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead for any reply<br/>
