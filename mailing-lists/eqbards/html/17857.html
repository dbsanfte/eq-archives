<div id="ygrps-yiv-867299179">The proper amount of seahorses is 4 swirlspine seahorses up top, and 4 <br/>
swirlspine guardians down below with Phinigel. Normally what we do is sit at <br/>
the ledge prepping, watch for the casting messages from the horses, and <br/>
count them up. We killed Phini nightly for a week trying for the trident and <br/>
robe with no prob. After the first time we pulled with Phini arriving with <br/>
13 or so horses, we petitioned. Of course, that was after our corpse <br/>
recovery. =)  The GM showed up, checked out the spawn and advised us the <br/>
spawn is messed up, so he reset the zone. On subsequent occasions, we <br/>
usually will try one pull. We&#39;ve killed phinigel with up to 7 guards (made <br/>
possible with 2 or 3 enchanters). If more than that comes we will just <br/>
petition, because the spawn is not correct anyways.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, for anyone still wondering if SS belt still drops, recently we got 2 in <br/>
a row on a raid.<br/>

&gt;Really?  They reset it for you?  One of my guild leaders, who has spent a<br/>
&gt;great deal of time studying Kedge, figured out that there are specific MOBs<br/>
&gt;who, if killed, cause an additional guardian to spawn.  Seeing a dozen <br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;at all unusual if you wait too long after a server reset.  If they&#39;ll reset<br/>
&gt;that, it&#39;s an interesting thing to know.  Right now, we just don&#39;t bother <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;Phinny if it&#39;s been more than a few days since the last reset.<br/>
