<div id="ygrps-yiv-297596031">The hybrid penalty is a HUGE problem.  If it worked like it did in AD&D,<br/>
fine, that would be one thing.  The problem is not that a class is slower to<br/>
level, but rather that having a hybrid in your group makes the whole group<br/>
level slower.  This unfairly penalizes your group members for what is<br/>
supposed to be your penalty.<br/>
When a kill is made, every member of the party is not given an equal number<br/>
of xp points.  No, every member is given a percentage of the total xp based<br/>
on how much xp they currently have.<br/>
<br/>
Lets take the most extreme example.  A group of 5 troll shadow knights<br/>
(highest xp penalty) and 1 halfling rogue (lowest xp penalty).  Lets assume<br/>
they&#39;re all the same level and they kill a monster worth 600xp.  Now you<br/>
think the intelligent thing would be to give each member of the group 100xp<br/>
each, but no, that&#39;s not how it works.  In this example, each troll SK would<br/>
get 108xp, and the poor halfling rogue would get 55xp.  The logic is that<br/>
the halfling needs less xp to level, so he gets less.  The problem is that<br/>
this system totally eliminates the idea of having a class that&#39;s easier to<br/>
level.  The poor little halfling got screwed by the hybrids in his group.<br/>
Replace all those troll SK&#39;s with non-hybrids, and suddenly our halfling is<br/>
getting twice the xp, and leveling twice as fast.<br/>
<br/>
Now granted, this is an extreme example, but every time you add a hybrid to<br/>
your group, the ability of the group to level quickly is decreased.  So you<br/>
tell me, who pays the penalty?  Hybrids?  Or those forced to group with<br/>
them?<br/>

I still get a kick out of people thinking there is some kind of XP &quot;penalty&quot;<br/>
for being a hybrid.  It&#39;s not a &quot;penalty&quot; it&#39;s just harder to level certain<br/>
classes than it is to level others.  This is due to varying benefits that<br/>
each class has.   Go look at an AD&D players handbook and look at the xp<br/>
differences for each class.  If you look in a 1st Edition one you can even<br/>
look at bards and realize that they are the single hardest class in AD&D to<br/>
level (had to level to 10 in warrior, 10 in thief then switch to bard and<br/>
level on an xp curve comparable to that of a paladin.).<br/>
