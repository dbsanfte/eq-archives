<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218705671">Oh that should make for some interesting conversations.  Now we just need a<br/>
petition to replace some of the PvP zones with Adult zones.<br/>
<br/>
You walk into Hogcaller&#39;s third story...<br/>
<br/>
	Warning, You have entered an Adult area if your Station is underage<br/>
you will be 	booted in thirty seconds.<br/>
<br/>
	To be followed with Loading...Please wait<br/>
	for anyone underage.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t give me any guff about what if my kid is playing on my account<br/>
stuff as that&#39;s a violation of the user agreement anyhow no matter how<br/>
common it might be.<br/>

If you aren&#39;t the groom, you shouldn&#39;t be &quot;gandering&quot; the bride, and if you<br/>
are....Verant kindly left us many empty rooms to find (but how &#39;bout a suite<br/>
w/<br/>
a hot tub?). Go off and have a nice cozy RP (but use /g or /t for your<br/>
evening<br/>
please....we don&#39;t need the Norrath version of the Pam/Tommy video)      ;)<br/>
