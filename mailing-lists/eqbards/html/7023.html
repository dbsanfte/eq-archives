<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why do the melee classes keep wanting Bind? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-213282448">* SNIP *<br/>
<br/>
I consistently read all over the net how members of certain melee classes are<br/>
sick and tired of having to go on 4 or 5 zone spanning runs to get back to their<br/>
body. Who are these folks kidding? The only zone that is 4 zones away from a<br/>
bind point is Nagafen&#39;s Lair. (Nag&#39;s Lair-&gt;Solusk A-&gt;Lavastorm-&gt;Nektulos-&gt;Neriak<br/>
Foreign Quarter.)<br/>
<br/>
All of the other zones in the world are usually only 2, sometimes 3, zones away<br/>
from a bind point. Is it just that folks aren&#39;t aware what the bind-able zones<br/>
are? Or maybe good aligned characters don&#39;t realize they can be bound in evil<br/>
cities just like good cities? Is a two zone run THAT bad?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;m ignoring the fact that an item exists that allows ANY character<br/>
to bind themselves ANYWHERE. Yes, it&#39;s hard to get, as it should be. But the<br/>
option to get the item is available. And as long as this option is available for<br/>
EVERY character, I don&#39;t think Verant will ever give binding ability to<br/>
non-spellcasters through any new class-wide ability.<br/>
<br/>

This is one of my pet peeves, so I&#39;ll field it :)<br/>
<br/>
Let me make one clarification first:  Melee classes don&#39;t want to bind, they<br/>
want to be bound in non-cities.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 groups of people on the server, binders and non.  Now, when you die<br/>
you come back naked.  A caster can mem his spells at his bind point and then :<br/>
Armor up, go invis, add speed, and still defend himself with DD type spells.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t really NEED to bind, he&#39;s good to make the run.<br/>
<br/>
A melee class character shows up naked and that&#39;s that.  Now this fellow, let&#39;s<br/>
say a warrior, must travel slowly across multiple zones, with no armor, no<br/>
weapons, and no invis.  If a random green creature crosses his path, he&#39;s dead.<br/>
More exp loss, more time lost, no chance to win the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Those that can bind don&#39;t need to, those that can&#39;t have a problem returning to<br/>
their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in a party of casters and fighters, when people die, some can rejoin right<br/>
away and continue to have fun, while others must run for quite some time,<br/>
risking additional death, and holding up the rest of the party.<br/>
<br/>
In my play window, if I die in the last half hour, my EQ time for the night is<br/>
done.  My casting buddies can jump right back in and play till quitting time.<br/>
Not a good value for my $10 / month.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me what &#39;balance&#39; issue is served by the bound-only-in-cities<br/>
rule?  The freedom and perks come from being able to bind yourself at will.<br/>
Melee folks will still have to beg and pay for this from casters.  But what is<br/>
being preserved or protected by the walk of shame?  It serves no realism or<br/>
gameplay value, and detracts from the game.  I don&#39;t mind dying, but I do mind<br/>
not having fun for no good reason.<br/>
<br/>
And I mind being killed by a green lion on the way back to my body because I&#39;m<br/>
naked.<br/>
<br/>
The bind rule serves no-one, and cuts into some paying customer&#39;s enjoyment and<br/>
time online, and not others.  Sure we could all play casters...but why should<br/>
we?  What&#39;s the bind rule for?<br/>
