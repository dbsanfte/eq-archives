<b>Subject:</b> Do we really NEED to talk about trolls here? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372263075">I don&#39;t know about everyone else&#39;s mail reader, but OE5 has a very<br/>
easy-to-use troll filter.  There&#39;s enough mail on this list as it is.<br/>
Complaining or even listening to trolls doesn&#39;t make the list any shorter,<br/>
and as it is I have difficulty keeping up with it.<br/>
<br/>
Please just use /ignore (well, the equivalent) and let the matter drop.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! :)<br/>
