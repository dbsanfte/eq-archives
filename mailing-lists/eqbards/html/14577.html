<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041479305">From Gordon:<br/>
In addition to the throwing changes, a new ability (much more exciting than<br/>
throwing) is being granted to the rogue class. The ability, called ´┐¢Evade´┐¢,<br/>
is tied to the ´┐¢Hide´┐¢ skill. It is used by targeting a creature and<br/>
pressing the ´┐¢Hide´┐¢ button. If it is successful, it will dramatically<br/>
reduce how much the targeted creature hates the rogue. The Rogue will be<br/>
given a message indicating success or failure.<br/>
<br/>
This new ability is, for all intents and purposes, a reverse taunt, and<br/>
will help the grouped rogue shift the targeted creatures focus back to the<br/>
tank after landing all of those hits. This is not like feign death, which<br/>
makes the creature forget you entirely, but rather just makes it hate you<br/>
less. In addition, it only works against the targeted creature.</div>
