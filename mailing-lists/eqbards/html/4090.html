<div id="ygrps-yiv-406416782">My experience with the boats came when I was invised and a floated near the<br/>
little spot where the orcs are near the shore. I conned one and it said<br/>
indifferent. Not knowing that invis does that I went up to the shore to<br/>
investigate why an orc would not care about me after bashing all dem ones in<br/>
WC and MT. I hailed with no response and then remembered that NPC&#39;s don&#39;t<br/>
respond to invised ppl. As soon as I turned off invis it attacked me while I<br/>
was still in the boat. I backed off and it stopped but it still looked<br/>
aggro&#39;d to me. I decided to see what would happen if I bellowed it from a<br/>
ways out. The bellow went through and it started hitting me even though it<br/>
was still on shore, I was in the boat, and the boat was a good ways out into<br/>
the lake. I thought I&#39;d be in trouble if it kept hitting me all the way to<br/>
the zone line (I didn&#39;t have any equipment sides a drum and flute) but it<br/>
stopped once I turned around.<br/>

	Odd place it is...<br/>

8)The boats seem to be cut off from the rest of the world.<br/>
8)While riding the large boats or a canoe, everything will be<br/>
8)indifferent to you.  I once hopped on a canoe to flee a tidal<br/>
8)lord train, and the instant I got on, they walked away as if<br/>
8)I&#39;d zoned.  I&#39;ve never tried attacking from one.<br/>

8)tried for a long<br/>

8)Hah.  My friend and I were riding the same canoe.  I was<br/>
8)busily guiding us to our destination when he makes a comment<br/>
8)about us going in circles.  I check my external view and he&#39;s<br/>
8)not on my boat.  He checks his external view and I&#39;m not on<br/>
8)his boat.  I sail back trying to find him or figure out what<br/>
8)happened, since he said he couldn&#39;t take control of his boat.<br/>
8)I can&#39;t find him, so I gave up control of my boat in the hopes<br/>
8)that it would let him take control of his boat.  He did, and<br/>
8)my boat disappeared from underneath me, dumping me in the<br/>
8)water.  But everything looked strange.  It turned out I&#39;d been<br/>
8)teleported when I was dumped, so that I was now in the water<br/>
8)*under* land.  I swam a bit to &quot;shore&quot; and popped up onto the<br/>
8)land.<br/>

8)We decided not to use a canoe to cross Lake Rathe.<br/>
