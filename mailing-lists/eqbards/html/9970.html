<b>Subject:</b> Re: Looting Issue <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370304933">I would have to say that the looting thing becomes less and less of a hassle<br/>
the further you progress in levels.  Above 20, most people are in guilds and<br/>
are fairly likely to be with at least one other guild member in a party<br/>
which tends to make people a little less greedy with loots - or so I&#39;ve seen<br/>
so far.  I have a very small guild (14 people - all levels 20-35) and yet<br/>
somehow we always end up having at least 3 of us in a party (most of the<br/>
time its 5 or 6).  We tend to do the master loot and split method.  We have<br/>
one person, usually a warrior type loot all the corpses.  If people are<br/>
looking to keep items like FS and the like, we do that alphabetically.  The<br/>
coin however, we split whenever a party member is leaving or right before a<br/>
new member joins so that nobody misses out on what they&#39;ve earned.  If<br/>
something rare comes up we find out who wants it and do the random roll<br/>
thing.   Almost everyone outside of the guild that we&#39;ve ever grouped with<br/>
has agreed that this is a much more efficient way of looting, as it keeps<br/>
away from the hard feelings of FFA, the bugs that incur during auto split<br/>
(i.e. looter gets 2pp, member 2 gets 2gp, member 3 gets 2sp, etc.), and the<br/>
added burden to weak party members (like myself).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just my little bit of input<br/>

P.S. I finally got to meet Elwyn the other day, oddly enough I have run into<br/>
him several times since then.  Funny how that works.  Thanks for letting me<br/>
tag along for a bit on Halloween Elwyn!<br/>
