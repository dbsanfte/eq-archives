<br/>
We all know that mobs get a second resist check against pixie strike and<br/>
lullaby.  Lets say for the first check they get a 25% (1 out of 4) chance to<br/>
resist and a 33% (1 out of 3) chance for the second resist.  Whats the<br/>
overall chance that they make just one of the two resists?<br/>
<br/>
I think its 58% but can&#39;t remember my stats classes to well:-).  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; Just a brief word on statistics.  If you want to get a reasonably good<br/>
&gt; &gt; approximation of what % something drops, you need a number of tests one<br/>
&gt; &gt; order of magnitude higher than the range.  So if its 5% you need at<br/>
&gt; least<br/>
&gt; &gt; 200 tests for statistical accuracy.  This isn&#39;t necessarily true for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; randoms, but for psuedo-random numbers such as computers produce, it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; generally the applicable rule.<br/>
