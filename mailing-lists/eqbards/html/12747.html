<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186733563">Here is an idea on how they can actually test changes on the test server.<br/>
Allow people to export copies of their characters from regular servers but<br/>
give them a tag that indicates they are an imported character.  Their names<br/>
would show up as a different color, say yellow since that will visibly stand<br/>
out.  Yellow tagged characters can only be used on Test during specific<br/>
date/times to test specified areas of the game.  They don&#39;t gain experience<br/>
and they can&#39;t loot any items.  They don&#39;t need EXP or items because they<br/>
are there for one reason only, to test changes made to the game.  Once the<br/>
test period is complete, those characters can&#39;t log in to the Test server.<br/>
Yellow tagged characters also would not be allowed to group with normal<br/>
characters.  This scenario should alleviate any concerns of the regular Test<br/>
server players who earned there levels the regular way.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; BTW about getting a character buffed to your present level on test? dont<br/>
&gt; &gt; hold your breath...they havent done anything like that since the<br/>
&gt; population<br/>
&gt; &gt; explosion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   The test server is for testing, if they don&#39;t understand that -<br/>
&gt;   then I won&#39;t bother wasting my time.  It does seem that those <br/>
&gt;   few people who play on the test server and invested time into<br/>
&gt;   a character feel bad about importing a L50 character into it.<br/>
&gt;   I completely understand your position, but I&#39;ve earned all my<br/>
&gt;   levels already, there&#39;s no surprise or falsity in copying my<br/>
&gt;   bard to test.  You kind make it sound like you&#39;ve earned your<br/>
&gt;   levels on the test server, so everyone else would have to.  I<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t want to play there, I simply want to test there.<br/>
