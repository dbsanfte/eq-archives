Back when there was only one FP&lt;-&gt;BB boat, it did a round trip<br/>
once every 12 game hours, which was 45 minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
Since it would&#39;ve been too convenient for people to be able to<br/>
type /time and figure the boat was going to arrive in 4 game<br/>
hours, Verant decided to make it not quite 12 game hours so<br/>
the exact time during the day drifts with each successive<br/>
trip.  :P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a known Clarity bug where your mana bar will show a<br/>
greater amount than you really have (phantom mana).  Casting a<br/>
spell will make it show the correct amount.  This bug has<br/>
gotten a lot of casters incorrectly assuming Clarity is<br/>
causing their spells to consume more mana.  It&#39;s just a client<br/>
update problem that nobody has been able to track down.<br/>
