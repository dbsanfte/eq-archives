<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890136797">Talk to a GM, they will probably have you email someone specific. If<br/>
they refuse ask for the email anyhow. Explain the situation and<br/>
depending on what kind of day the person had you may or may not get it<br/>
back. I&#39;ve never gotten the shaft on lost item bugs before but people I<br/>
know have. However, not to be a downer, it was a bronze mace and they<br/>
may not deem it to be worth the effort. If you get past their lazyness<br/>
you aught get it back. Best of luck.<br/>

&gt; I was still in the first bubble of a level which is when I always<br/>
&gt; carry blunt, slashing, and piercing weapons to get my skills up.  <br/>
&gt; After looting my corpse, I just had slashing and piercing weapons. My<br/>
&gt; inventory was not full (not even the main slots, let alone slots in<br/>
&gt; containers) and in the past anything on the cursor at death has gone<br/>
&gt; into inventory.  I know I didn&#39;t drop it, I&#39;ve got item dropping set<br/>
&gt; on &quot;never&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So is this a bug or have I lost it completely?<br/>

&gt; apparently poofed her second. <br/>
