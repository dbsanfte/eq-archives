&gt; I used to do this a lot too, now I&#39;ll tell my group that if they want me to<br/>

&gt; songs nearly 100% of the time that I&#39;m grouped with them, in battle and out.<br/>
&gt; Practially in &quot;battle mode&quot; all the time.  What do they do between battles?<br/>
&gt; Well they chat, go to the bathroom, get a Coke, mem spells, do guildsay,<br/>
&gt; etc.  I don&#39;t get to do any of these things if I&#39;m weaving Hymn/Clarity.<br/>
&gt; Sure, if I&#39;m the only healer in a group (it happens) or we&#39;re making a big<br/>
&gt; effort to keep downtime minimized then there&#39;s no choice.  But If there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; Shaman or better in the group I beg off of playing Hymn.<br/>

casters.  I tell them to heal the folks who need it and sit<br/>
their butts back down to med.  I will keep both songs up to<br/>
top everyone off, but if someone has like a bubble missing, I<br/>
figure that&#39;s a job for a healer.  Also, I usually play<br/>
Clarity, and tap Hymn every time I notice the icon is gone if<br/>
we&#39;re not really trying to minimize downtime.  There&#39;s plenty<br/>
of time to chat and do stuff in between the Hymn pulses, and<br/>
it&#39;s no big deal if I miss a pulse (or 10) while typing<br/>
something up.<br/>
<br/>
What really annoys me are the necros in skeletal form<br/>
(constantly lose hp-&gt;mana), and manastone junkies.  :)  With<br/>
them, it *is* a neverending job.  Again, get any healers at or<br/>
near FM to heal them and sit their butts back down.<br/>
