plan for when you get a bad fight will far outweigh any<br/>
benefit from using a fast weapon vs. an equally efficient slow<br/>
weapon.  I most often find myself fleeing (or dying) in<br/>
multi-mob situations (where mesmerize/Lullaby/Strike have a<br/>
much greater impact on the outcome than weapon damage<br/>
distribution).<br/>

On top of this you have variability of damage in the mob&#39;s<br/>
attacks that determines how long you get to swing your weapons<br/>
before you have to bail.  Their attack delay is 30 (38 or more<br/>
if slowed), which if I&#39;m to believe these other posts about<br/>
how variable the damage from slow weapons are, would mean the<br/>
variability in their damage should swamp out any consistency<br/>
you see due to less variability with your faster weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Getting &quot;bad rolls&quot; during a fight is really only a problem<br/>
when I&#39;m soloing.  Usually my friends and I are pulling 2-4<br/>
blue-yellow mobs and fighting them one by one in succession.<br/>
So for each individual fight, we have a huge safety margin of<br/>
like 5x to 10x - even a 2x variability in our damage just<br/>
isn&#39;t going to make a difference - maybe I&#39;ll have to Strike<br/>
the next mob a few extra times, but over the course of<br/>
fighting all the mobs, we get pretty darned close to the<br/>
average; enough so that my friends and I have a pretty good<br/>
idea of exactly what we can and can&#39;t handle.  The biggest<br/>
variability in fact comes from our inability to distinguish a<br/>
high blue from a low blue when assessing early on in a fight<br/>
whether or not we&#39;ll be able to take them all.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and other people dumping their trains onto us while we&#39;re<br/>
fighting - heck, 90% of my deaths are due to that.  I can only<br/>
think of a half dozen times in the last 10 levels where we&#39;ve<br/>
had to flee or died because we underestimated our pull, and<br/>
most of my friends use 2h weapons with delays ranging from<br/>
44-50.<br/>
