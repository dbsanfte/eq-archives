&gt; So, what, I join the list and you all get quiet?  I&#39;m only 11, my<br/>
&gt; reputation cannot have preceded me as yet.  I&#39;ve been soloing in NK<br/>
&gt; since 9, my first bard.  Any words of wisdom on where to go next?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;d be really great would be if a couple of real pros would list<br/>
where they soloed for each level(s) on their way up, like &quot;from 12-16<br/>
I killed monsters in zone X through melee, then up to 20 I kited Pink<br/>
Volvo Demons who conned yellow, then...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually started my own list just to find out where to solo<br/>
at &quot;higher&quot; levels (people try to say you should give it up after<br/>
about 12th, but I prefer solo)...Soloing Everquest,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to post what I know about soloing, and data I&#39;m<br/>
accumulating, like lists of soloable MObs (monsters) for each level,<br/>
tricks for soloing better (how to automatically raise your sense<br/>
direction, forage, mend, and other skills as fast as possible, no<br/>
button-clicking required), and other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My hope is that both people with questions and people with advice<br/>
will join the list and post, and we can get a really good<br/>
infosite/faq going after a while.<br/>
