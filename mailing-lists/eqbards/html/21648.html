Subject: [eqbards] Charming Giants<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Got a question for you guys who do alot of Giant charming.  I seem to have a<br/>
particulary hard time getting them targeted on each other. Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
My general charm tactics are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
-	find a critter, charm it, fire up selos and start looking for an<br/>
opponent<br/>
- 	find an opponent, recharm my pet, re-target the opponent, let my pet<br/>
get real close to me and give it the attack order<br/>
-	Fire selos back up....back off to maximum range..recharm as<br/>
necessary, doing big circles around critters if charm is resisted <br/>
- 	when pet is getting low on health, do a health check....helps if you<br/>
have critters that run when they are low on health..as the<br/>
opponent will run if he is losing<br/>
- 	Either chant kite, fear kite or pull out the weapons and kill the<br/>
remaining critter if health is low enough...or find another target and send<br/>
my pet back into the fray.<br/>
<br/>
My various problems are:<br/>
<br/>
-	my initial charm wears off to soon for my pet to make it to the<br/>
target to attack, so I have to redo the entire charm, get close to pet, tell<br/>
it to attack etc.<br/>
-	both critters run at me, the pet is behind the target and the target<br/>
keeps running at me instead of turning to fight my pet<br/>
-	targeting in general.  F8 targets the closest hostile, but what if<br/>
both are uncharmed?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or do I just need to practice more?<br/>
