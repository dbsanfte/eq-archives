Ok, I kind of see where you&#39;re going with this.  And it would be neat to<br/>
have bard buffs that dramatically increase stats for a shor period of time.<br/>
<br/>
Good point :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Let&#39;s put it this way:  Once you buff those two people and you are oom<br/>
  you don&#39;t have to buff them for over an hour.  If you are doing full<br/>
  buffs, then chances are you are not the primary healer.<br/>
<br/>
  My buff lasts a whopping 6 secs.  And is half the power of yours.<br/>
  That&#39;s ridiculous.  Not only does it last 1/600th of the time<br/>
  but it does 1/2 the boost.<br/>
<br/>
  Our party songs should exceed any other player class buffs for<br/>
  the pure reason that they are extremely temporary.  Well that&#39;s<br/>
  my reasoning.  It may not be 100% correct, but sheeeit.<br/>
