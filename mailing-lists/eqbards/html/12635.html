<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131027822">Yah but it makes pretty good sense when you think about it. Now I know now a<br/>
days people don&#39;t do this but people always use to bring two full groups<br/>
into the room to break it nothing like it is now. Of all the people how<br/>
often does a bard really melee at that level? A war? Personally I just think<br/>
them lee classes should get the first yak and then a bard who  I still can&#39;t<br/>
decide what to call it besides bard. They don&#39;t seem like a melee class to<br/>
me at high leels butrather a support utility.<br/>

&gt;Isn&#39;t this a bit of a double standard? I assume people were upset<br/>
&gt;because a ranger is better at melee and thus theoretically could have<br/>
&gt;made use of the mistwalker more than a druid, yet the staff (forbidden<br/>
&gt;rites I assume) is also a pretty kick butt melee weapon and just as<br/>
&gt;useless in the hands of a cleric as the mistwalker would be in the hands<br/>
&gt;of a druid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is also the same kind of attitude that was used to keep Bards out<br/>
&gt;of the early lottos for Ykeshas on my server and it still pisses me off.<br/>
