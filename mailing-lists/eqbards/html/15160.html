<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965462958"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Imagine that an Incandecent Gloves (I use enchanter because they<br/>
&gt;are so involved<br/>
&gt;with everyone elses quest items- and I play one ) needed to have a<br/>
&gt;bard sing a<br/>
&gt;tune to change the Shadow Gloves to &quot;Resonant Gloves&quot;.  They<br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t have just<br/>
&gt;had one class be involved in many of these quests.  In trade<br/>
&gt;skills, image that<br/>
&gt;a bard was necessary to create even better armor/weapons- the bard<br/>
&gt;can sing his<br/>
&gt;song to make sure that the metal used is &quot;pure&quot;, or that the seams are &quot;in<br/>
&gt;harmony&quot; (giving them additional strenght).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*sigh* I play an enchanter too. Before they start giving bard the ability<br/>
to make enchanted items, why don&#39;t they implement what they promised to do<br/>
for enchanters in doing the same first?<br/>
<br/>
We even have Viscuous Mana, etc now that seems to imply they would be<br/>
working on more. And... nothing.<br/>
