If I ever get Evulia up to level 20, I will seriously consider a last name of Ronco(TM).  :-)<br/>

&gt; I love playing my bard.  I have played her almost exclusively for the last 18<br/>
&gt; months and I still have a lot of fun.  The bard class suits me and I have had<br/>
&gt; some amazing times when everything went right and I saved my group.  But it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; getting harder and harder to do that hehe.  Still, I am not going to give up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That said, I got this mental image that I wanted to share here (and I am going<br/>
&gt; to date myself here)...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are watching TV late at night, or bowling on Sunday afternoon maybe, and a<br/>
&gt; commercial comes on for (drumroll please...) the Ronco Fish-O-Matic!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Folks, this is 68 fishing tools in one!  You can leave that heavy, extra box<br/>
&gt; full of tools at home, just slip one of these beauties in your tackle box and<br/>
&gt; you are set!  It&#39;s shiny!  It looks great!  Be the envy of your friends!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So you buy one and head out on your first fishing trip.  And guess what?  It<br/>
&gt; sorta works.  It almost does what they said.  You have to put extra effort into<br/>
&gt; everything, and you have to be really careful because it isn&#39; very sturdy and<br/>
&gt; you might break it.  And even when you are careful from time to time it just<br/>
&gt; snaps and you get a nasty cut.  But it isn&#39;t JUNK exactly....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You getting where I am going with this?  LOL that&#39;s right - bards are the EQ<br/>
&gt; equivalent of the all-in-one Fish-O-Matic.  We do work OK much of the time, but<br/>
&gt; ya gotta be really careful.  And if you can afford to haul the real thing,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d be better off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With a wry smile and a jaunty salute,<br/>
