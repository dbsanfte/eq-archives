&gt; Some people really enjoy playing the merchant. I do sometimes, did it<br/>

&gt; think I should give my real price up front or give too high a price so<br/>
&gt; they can haggle down or always list a price or not list a price.. gets<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had fun with it for a while. When I played in Unrest back in my 20&#39;s<br/>
fine steel wasn&#39;t very common, in fact it was virtually unknown in the<br/>
Quenos area, so I build up a bank full of it and ran over to Quenos to<br/>
sell it. As I knew players over there make a lot of money in Blackburrow<br/>
and probably many had store bought weapons, I offered to &quot;upgrade&quot;<br/>
people&#39;s store bought weapons to fine steel for free. Of course it<br/>
wasn&#39;t really free because with my charisma I could sell the store<br/>
bought weapon back to a vendor for almost as much as it sold for. <br/>
<br/>
After a few trips I gave it up though. Even with Selo&#39;s it was too long<br/>
a trip for the money you made, and it would take quite a while to sell<br/>
stuff. Plus by then I was getting small bronze plate as loot more<br/>
often which was easier to sell locally.<br/>
<br/>
Also I started getting tells from people who were quite annoying<br/>
when I told them no, I won&#39;t drop what I&#39;m doing and run to the other<br/>
side of the world to sell you a fine steel spear right now. That kind of<br/>
soured me on the merchant thing and ever since I have mainly sold stuff<br/>
back to vendors as it&#39;s much less hassle.<br/>
