 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d be bitter playing just about any class then.  Almost every class is<br/>
&quot;unfinished&quot;.  There are many spells and skills that were never implemented<br/>
or useless.  For example many classes have the Sense Magic spell, which has<br/>
no use at all.  And what about the poor Rogues?  They are much worse off<br/>
than Bards.<br/>
<br/>
Brad has stated numerous times that EQ is a work in progress.  If you are<br/>
going to be bitter about the unfinished parts, either suck it up and live<br/>
with it or quit EQ.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Haha.  Kitasi, I thought you said the ability to bind was one of the most<br/>
important abilities in the game.  How could giving Bind to Bards not be<br/>
unbalancing?<br/>
