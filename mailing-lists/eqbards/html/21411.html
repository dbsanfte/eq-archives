I myself have a 30 bard and always have trouble trying to get in to a<br/>
group.  I always wondered why until a couple months ago when it just hit<br/>
me.  I kept getting these groups where people would say, &quot;Wow, your songs<br/>
are great.  I never grouped with a bard before.&quot;  I&#39;m not talking one group<br/>
a week but several.  I usually have to laugh at it . . . level 30+ and<br/>
never been with a bard?  I guess most people just never played with bards,<br/>
they would rather just have a healer/nuker/tank, not something in between.<br/>
I even did a &quot;/who all bard 40 60&quot; last night on The Rathe for $hits and<br/>
giggles 2200 people . . . 15 players found.  It is a shame there are not<br/>
many of us out there.  I don&#39;t remember the 30-40 number but it was around<br/>
12-15 people.  Granted it doesn&#39;t included /anon or /role but still . . .<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If bards are the best grouping class in all Everquest,<br/>
&gt;every group should love to have one.<br/>
&gt;But in the reality of Norath, a bard can hardly find a group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So something is wrong, and i know that&#39;s not the &quot;a bard can hardly find a<br/>
&gt;group&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nothing to say more. </span></blockquote></div>
