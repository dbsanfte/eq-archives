to the server (either completely, or due to a big burst of<br/>
packet loss).  No connection = no interaction.  You can still<br/>
run around, but from what I&#39;ve seen, it appears the server<br/>
thinks you stay in one place until the connection is restored,<br/>
then get warped over to your new position (and get to see a<br/>
dozen &quot;[mob] HITS you&quot; messages scroll by when all this time<br/>
you thought you were out of range).<br/>

I&#39;ve only have the displeasure of dying this way once.  I was<br/>
running full tilt (Accelerando + drum) with an orc warrior and<br/>
priest behind me, pulling them to my group, when I lost<br/>
connection.  I found my body in the opposite direction I had<br/>
been running.  I can only guess that the priest cast a spell<br/>
on me, the server made me turn around and initiate autocombat<br/>
(punching no less), then made me flee when I was about to die.<br/>

the &quot;[character name] saved&quot; message.  I&#39;ll run around, but I<br/>
won&#39;t risk *doing* anything.  I crashed once on the boat, was<br/>
teleported to a &quot;safe spot&quot; in Butcherblock, camped, and<br/>
logged in later to find myself back in the Ocean of Tears, no<br/>
boat, no land in sight. Took me the entire night&#39;s gameplay to<br/>
get back to civilization, all because I was impatient and<br/>
didn&#39;t wait for that &quot;saved&quot; message.<br/>
