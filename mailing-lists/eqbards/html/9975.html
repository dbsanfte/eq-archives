&gt;     What galls me the most are the rash of characters named &quot;Aaaba&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &quot;Aaada&quot; (the three a&#39;s is NOT a typo here).  Obviously these character names<br/>
&gt; were decided purely to go first in alpha loot.  With a character name<br/>
&gt; starting with &quot;S&quot; I&#39;m usually one of the last to loot.  Even in &quot;honorable&quot;<br/>
&gt; groups - when we do the 5pp or item loot - I often don&#39;t get my turn.<br/>

who goes first, then continue with alpha from there.  This is a harder sell in <br/>
pick-up groups (but when I&#39;m calling loot order, they really can&#39;t say much - yet <br/>
another reason for me to do it), but your guildmates should understand the <br/>
concept.<br/>
