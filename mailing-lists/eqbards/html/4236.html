<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611671389">Well, at level 6 your supposed to be hunting stuff in qeynos hills but <br/>
     there are those two annoying druids NPCs that will KOS (Kill on sight) <br/>
     anyone fighting animals.  I found that area very annoying so I suggest <br/>
     that you dash through BB (it&#39;s a fairly safe short run at peak time <br/>
     when all the surface gnolls are camped.) and get yourself bound in <br/>
     Halas.  Then hunt the various Ice goblin camps and the edges of the <br/>
     open area for possible blue/white critters.  It&#39;s a beautiful zone and <br/>
     the snow makes it easier to see in the dark.<br/>
     <br/>
        If you feel like some travel to a very empty zone take the ship to <br/>
     Eurdin, work your way through the city to the Tox forest.  As you come <br/>
     out the gate head straight south through the newbie zone till you hit <br/>
     the bridge that crosses the river (roughly 0 100), cross and hunt the <br/>
     kobald camps and poachers (their heads are a good quest item at your <br/>
     level.<br/>
     <br/>
     Just a couple of suggestion, there are many other areas.  Umm actually <br/>
     if you feel rally brave you can sprint to Misty Thicket near <br/>
     Rivervale. I think it is the best place to level up to 10-12th in the <br/>
     game.<br/>

Heya,<br/>
     <br/>
You fine folks have any suggestions for a level 6 Bard on where to hunt? <br/>
Im was born in, and live around the Qeynos area. I have been helping keep <br/>
the rat population down, and lately have been working on keeping the <br/>
dreaded Black Burrow entrance free of Scouts and Guards. However I am in <br/>
need of greater adventure. As a bard, I need great adventures to write <br/>
songs about.<br/>
     <br/>
ooc: So if I help someone who is a level 23 warrior find their body, and <br/>
they give me stuff, is this considered twinking? <br/>
     <br/>
ooc2: Ever notice how many of us bards have names that start with T?<br/>
