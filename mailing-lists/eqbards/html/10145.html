&gt; Hello Bards and friends,<br/>
&gt;    Seeing that I&#39;m nearing lvl 17, i was curious about a few things<br/>
&gt; really...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) What is a good strategy to use while dual weilding? ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dual Wield is an automatic skill.  If you equip two weapons, you&#39;ll use the skill, <br/>
and you&#39;ll get better at it.  Since skill checks appear to happen each time you <br/>
swing, you&#39;ll get better faster if you use the fastest weapons you can.<br/>
<br/>
Your PGT and dagger combo is probably OK, perhaps a tad heavy, but I was Dual <br/>
Wielding two Mino Axes at one point, and didn&#39;t really take a hit unless the fight <br/>
was a long one (e.g., it&#39;s OK for groups, it stinks solo).<br/>
<br/>
You probably want to use weapons with different delays.  That way, they are hitting <br/>
non-simultaneously, and enemy casters are less likely to be able to slip spells in <br/>
between your swings.<br/>
<br/>
Dual Wield appears to trigger for me (skill 165) perhaps once for every three-four <br/>
primary swings, so don&#39;t count on it being a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I loved my Thulian Claws.  hehe<br/>
