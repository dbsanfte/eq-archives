<div id="ygrps-yiv-341804327">No.  If it was only a 20% difference over the whole of the night, then some<br/>
fights you would outdamage the other party significantly.  that&#39;s how random<br/>
numbers work.  Fights are far too small in sample size individually for the<br/>
whole&#39;s difference to hold true unless it is large.<br/>
<br/>
Example I did run through.  20 fights vs blue aviaks with a ranger of equal<br/>
level.  I out damaged him on one fight.  Odds say that would mean I was 25%<br/>
behind him assuming a sample size ration that was present, 20-1.  It was<br/>
close, he did 33% more damage than I did.  Same level, same weapons.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No the few times I got hit were when early in the fight they both missed<br/>
&gt;several times in a row and I did not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly my point.  Although they normally outperform you, the random<br/>
number generator gave them a few really bad rolls.  That&#39;s the only way<br/>
you&#39;d ever be able to outdamage someone who generally outdamages you.<br/>
That&#39;s where the &quot;20% over 50 fights&quot; (the exact numbers are hypothetical,<br/>
of course) comes from.  As the duration of the test sample (ie, the more<br/>
rounds of combat), the damage dealt falls more inline with what was<br/>
expected.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you&#39;re correct on the level difference contributing to the skew.  I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed melee damage depends on the level difference between myself and the<br/>
mob.  For the test to be most accurate, you&#39;ll need a partner that&#39;s the<br/>
same level, with the same weapon and weapon skill.  Since the SK would use a<br/>
2H, that one&#39;s gonna be harder to test... John?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;d LOVE to see the logs if you perform this test.  It&#39;s something<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to do with a warrior friend, once he hits 50 (almost<br/>
there).<br/>
