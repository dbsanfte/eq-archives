&gt; Don&#39;t underestimate the Carillon! I play a half elf and went to Kaladim to <br/>
&gt; buy steel armor for a high elf friend of mine (I found that the gnomes <br/>
&gt; quoted same prices in Ak&#39;anon earlier). The dwaven smith quoted me at around <br/>
&gt; 960 plat or so for a small steel breastplate. After buffing my Charisma with <br/>
&gt; all my CHA items i managed to shave about 5- to 75 plat off that. Then i <br/>
&gt; conned him and found he was apprehensive so I used Carrillon on him to make <br/>
&gt; him Amiable. I was astounded to see the price for a small steel breastplate <br/>
&gt; drop to 805 plat! I think Enchanters got it better for this type of thing, <br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s my best price list again for small steel plate:<br/>
<br/>
787.5 Breastplate<br/>
346.5 Boots<br/>
252   Bracers<br/>
420   Greaves<br/>
294   Belt<br/>
147   Collar<br/>
483   Gloves<br/>
336   Arms<br/>
367.5 Pauldron<br/>
367.5 Helm<br/>
105   Mask<br/>
399   Cloak<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;hidden&quot; base price is 5% below this (price/1.05).  The<br/>
best selling price is 5% below that.  Needless to say, all my<br/>
friends ask me to do their big-ticket buying/selling for them.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly saving up for the greaves (already have the breastplate<br/>
and arms)...<br/>
