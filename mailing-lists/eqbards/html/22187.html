<div id="ygrps-yiv-466755900">I thought the view from the top of Kurn&#39;s tower was quite nice. Also the top<br/>
of the dwarf statue above Kaladim is scenic.<br/>

i agree the rivervale bank (way up top the mountain) is a nice view. I used<br/>
to do it all the time way back when...<br/>

WOW!  Very nice climb.  Gives me something to strive for.  So far, I&#39;ve been<br/>
up the wizard spires, and the RV bank, but than I&#39;m only 13th, so have a<br/>
little while before I can attempt that one.  Nice to know I&#39;m not the only<br/>
dare devil bard around.  Everyone thinks I&#39;m nuts, but hey, it&#39;s a great<br/>
view up there. *smiles*<br/>

  Well, I was slightly bored on Saturday, so I decided to climb the statue<br/>
of Firiona Vie in FV.  Anything that tall is just meant to be climbed :).  I<br/>
don&#39;t think it would be possible to anyone not a Bard, but it may be<br/>
possible.  Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/">http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/</a> for screenshots and a<br/>
description of how I did it.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope a few of you try it yourself, it&#39;s a blast and a great view : )<br/>
