<div id="ygrps-yiv-219802218">I think silver-plated legs are better than mithril greaves for bards,<br/>
but this is just my opinion. Mithril Vambraces on the other hand simply<br/>
cannot be beat by anything else a bard can equip. The arms are ac 10 +7<br/>
str +5 sv magic if my memory is serving me well, while imbrued are ac 16<br/>
+9 intel +10 sv vs poison. The mithril still have clearly better stat<br/>
modifiers than imbrued, but I wear the imbrued for 1) color-matching, 2)<br/>
I felt it would be selfish to keep mithril when I was lucky enough to<br/>
have gotten planes armor (mithril goes back to guild), 3) That ac 16<br/>
becomes +27 ac with my AGI.<br/>
<br/>
On Oppaline earrings, I think these are fantastic for bards, and many<br/>
enchanters wear them. Like Elwyn I still wear mine at 50, and have seen<br/>
nothing that even interests me as a possible replacement. A Fishbone<br/>
earring is very useful, but I swap that in for Kedge, not something I<br/>
wear full time.<br/>
