<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334364271">i think with the right equipment i don&#39;t think &quot;never&quot; applies to any of<br/>
those classes except rogue.  they may lose many times, but i am sure a<br/>
warrior, paladin, and ranger with most of the best equipment in the game<br/>
(there are many of these in my guild) could solo an HG.  what do you think<br/>
about monk?  i&#39;m sure they could as well.  bards?  of course we can ;)<br/>
