<div id="ygrps-yiv-696294718">All of my wood elf buddies (males) wearing silver plate legs, shin  greaves, <br/>
steel plate, all of it looks rosy colored. The only exception was the female <br/>
merchant in Kelethin that looks VERY silver - no blue or rosy tinge. I&#39;m <br/>
using voodoo3.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;An appearance question for all you steel plate wearing wood-elf males out<br/>
&gt;there.  What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am wearing the shin<br/>
&gt;greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I have never seen<br/>
&gt;anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be a rose tinged<br/>
&gt;silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>
&gt;examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The wood elf <br/>
&gt;females<br/>
&gt;I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged.  Is this the<br/>
&gt;normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose color is <br/>
&gt;normal<br/>
&gt;then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>
