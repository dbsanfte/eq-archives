&gt; The whole point of a DoT is to poison something. If we<br/>
&gt; as players chase a mob that poisoned us, does OUR<br/>
&gt; poison stop? I bet I can tell you the answer to that<br/>
&gt; one rather quickly. Poison is poison. It&#39;s in the body,<br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t go away just because you have to chase<br/>
&gt; something. I don&#39;t normally kite (how boring) but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; totally against them changing the spells this drastically<br/>
&gt; for everyone just because some people do.<br/>

and especially not to any fix they have put in since release. Or at<br/>
least not the fixes that weren&#39;t targetted at specific bugs. The quick<br/>
fix game balance changes that they have put seem so poorly thought out<br/>
and often poorly implemented as to make me wonder what they did with the<br/>
people who designed and coded this brilliant game in the first place.<br/>
