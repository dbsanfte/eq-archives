<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-693910976">Yes, I have asked this before, but my mail server crashed and I have not<br/>
been getting mail until recently - so...<br/>
<br/>
I friend of mine said he read something about a thrown weapon that returns<br/>
to the thrower (an axe, I think).  My question is, does a weapon like this<br/>
exist?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, this debate has certainly heated things up.  Its clear there is an<br/>
&gt;easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure where you draw this line.... Please define it a little more so<br/>
I can figure out if you&#39;ve pre-classified me as a powergamer or a<br/>
roleplayer.  From your message, I believe you&#39;re talking about the Platemail<br/>
issue, but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  If so, I believe you&#39;re<br/>
labelling me as a powergamer, because, as I&#39;ve previously mentioned, I<br/>
believe our class is Balanced with the use of Plate in mind.  I believe that<br/>
a Bard that doesn&#39;t use Plate is like a Monk that doesn&#39;t use his punch<br/>
because &quot;Every class can punch&quot;.  Now, if that doesn&#39;t fit YOUR image of a<br/>
Bard, then you&#39;re more than free to take the AC hit and not wear it....<br/>
Please don&#39;t tell those of us that do choose to wear plate that we&#39;re wrong,<br/>
or aren&#39;t roleplayers.  I am roleplaying the Bard class as Verant designed<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>
&gt;image of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>
&gt;while sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bazooka too.  Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>
&gt;is moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard.  to me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;image is more important than being as effective as possible.  I kinda wish<br/>
&gt;they&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>
&gt;light armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>
&gt;even equal, just better than nothing.  If not, oh well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I like the idea of having some bard specific items.  Singing swords,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>magical<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;instruments, any of these would be great!  Most of the other classes seem<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;have items tailored towards them with the exception of bards.  Oh yeah sure<br/>
&gt;we can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>
&gt;like a monk, why would we?  It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt;could make better use of than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bard&#39;s are Jack of All trades - Borrowing from many different classes.<br/>
We&#39;re different than monks, Monks have their own set of skills.  Ours are<br/>
part fighter, part rogue, part magical, part of many things.  I&#39;ll use any<br/>
weapon or skill that&#39;s available to me, that betters my class.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>
&gt;The way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>
&gt;they should travel more than any other character.  To have to do this<br/>
&gt;without being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>
&gt;minstrel could bind himself anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am wholeheartedly against Bind for Bards.  No other Hybrid gets this.<br/>
This is reserved for the pure casters.  Yes it would be nice to have, but<br/>
&quot;it&#39;d be nice to have a bazooka too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I somewhat agreed with everything on the petition but the Bind and the Exp<br/>
issues.  I was a little bit peeved to see the petition ask for a bonus in<br/>
ability (Bind) that makes the class stronger, and at the same time ask for<br/>
less of an exp hit.... We are hybrids.  Hybrids have a penalty.  We can tank<br/>
and cast spells with our songs.... We get a penalty in Exp for that and we<br/>
should.  As far as soloing... Verant has always said this is a group game.<br/>
I don&#39;t level any noticeably slower than my GF (High Elf Magician) who I<br/>
group with on EVERY kill.   So in groups, as Verant designed the game, it&#39;s<br/>
been my exp that we&#39;re not really disadvantaged at all.  While Bards CAN<br/>
solo and DO solo, I believe Bards belong in a party.  If someone chooses to<br/>
solo, then they should take the extra penalties for doing so in a group<br/>
based game.<br/>
