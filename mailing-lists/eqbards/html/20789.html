&gt; <br/>
&gt; Singing Blues <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have more than one bard in the group (which I have had <br/>
&gt; a bunch) can both bards uses Chords of Discord and damage the <br/>
&gt; same mobs? Or are these songs limited like regular spells <br/>
&gt; appear to be? [I&#39;m pretty sure Hymn of Restoration does not <br/>
&gt; heal faster, but that too is a question; any chance for a <br/>
&gt; chorus to be more effective than a soloist?] <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; GZ ANSWERS <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most Bard songs do not stack on top of each other - once you <br/>
&gt; have a song being sung to you, having more than one person <br/>
&gt; singing the song does not give any further effect. With the <br/>
&gt; way EQ Bardic magic was built, Bards are more soloists then <br/>
&gt; chorus members. Any song with a duration (that leaves an <br/>
&gt; icon) will not stack - so no, having two Bards using the Hymn <br/>
&gt; of Restoration will not make you heal faster. Having two <br/>
&gt; bards using Chords could be more effective then a single Bard <br/>
&gt; singing it - monsters do occasionally save verses the song. <br/>
&gt; It would probably be better for the multiple Bard party, <br/>
&gt; however, to sing different songs. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This being said, the following is a list of Bard songs that <br/>
&gt; do not have a duration (they leave no icon), and can <br/>
&gt; therefore be played by any number of Bards at full effect. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   a.. Alenia`s Disenchanting Melody <br/>
&gt;   b.. Brusco`s Boastful Bellow <br/>
&gt;   c.. Brusco`s Bombastic Bellow <br/>
&gt;   d.. Cassindra`s Chorus of Clarity <br/>
&gt;   e.. Denon`s Desperate Dirge <br/>
&gt;   f.. Denon`s Dissension <br/>
&gt;   g.. Lyssa`s Cataloging Libretto <br/>
&gt;   h.. Lyssa`s Locating Lyric <br/>
&gt;   i.. Melanie`s Mellifluous Motion <br/>
&gt;   j.. Song of Dawn <br/>
&gt;   k.. Song of Highsun <br/>
&gt;   l.. Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria <br/>
&gt; <br/>
