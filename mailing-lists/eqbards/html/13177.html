<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-732022322">Lately, I&#39;ve been debating with a handful of people whether <br/>
  level has anything to do with meleeing a NPC.<br/>
<br/>
  The arguement I&#39;ve seen is does a L39 warrior (with maxxed<br/>
  skills) have the same melee potential as a L50 warrior.<br/>
<br/>
  (fill in warrior with bard in our case, I just picked a tank)<br/>
<br/>
  Casters most definitely have level limits on casting spells<br/>
  at higher level mobs.  6 levels or so is the average, despite<br/>
  what Gordon may have posted on the websites contradicting it.<br/>
  I know for a fact, my L17 druid cannot cast on something that<br/>
  cons white to a L24 no matter how hard I try.  If that holds<br/>
  true from a L39 casting on a L50, I dunno.  The casters here<br/>
  with characters that high will have to answer that.  My guess<br/>
  is they will be met with steady resists.<br/>
<br/>
  So back to melee players.  Since I&#39;ve been helping a few of<br/>
  my friends out with melee characters, I&#39;ve noticed an interesting<br/>
  trend.  If I bring a aviak darter (L17ish) to a L17 warrior he<br/>
  has no problem hitting it, if I bring a L25ish archer to him he<br/>
  struggles with misses, lower dmg, more mob ripostes/dodges.  This<br/>
  leads me to believe that level is playing a factor on hits and<br/>
  damage.<br/>
<br/>
  The discussion then becomes is a L39 tank producing the same<br/>
  damage output as a L50 tank with the same weapons?  After the<br/>
  skills are maxxed is level nothing more than a little more hp<br/>
  and such?<br/>
<br/>
  All the tests I&#39;ve run and experimented with were on lower level<br/>
  characters, but I&#39;m curious if the trend holds true to higher <br/>
  levels.<br/>
<br/>
  A skeleton attacking my L8 cleric, will hit consistantly and<br/>
  the damage will be considerate.  A skeleton attacking my L50<br/>
  bard will miss me 90% of the time, or I will dodge, or it will<br/>
  hit for 1 or 2 dmg.  This leads me to believe that level is <br/>
  definitely playing a role in hitting and damage capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
  What do you all think?<br/>
