<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220988690">Greetings and welcome to the list!<br/>
<br/>
Great story! I am by no means the expert on Perma (looks around nervously<br/>
for Harmonic) but it seems to me that your group is about 10 levels too low<br/>
to hold the room where this stuff drops.  I was under the impression that<br/>
you&#39;d want a lo to mid 30&#39;s crew.  Possibly 2 solid mid to high 20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The one and only time I was there - we had 8 (2 groups of 4) and ranged from<br/>
mid 20&#39;s to lo 40&#39;s and we had no prob until we tried an Ice Giant Sha-woman<br/>
or Priestess (?) she spanked us badly before we evac&#39;d.  I got a Crys Blade<br/>
and Icy Greave and some decent xp for the afternoon party.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to go back for a Slivery Axe - &lt;hint hint - Harm, Kenross, Jaez,<br/>
Cappa, Doub&#39;s, Opera, Rosha, Once (honey I don&#39;t want you to get hurt - so<br/>
stand behind double and when he dies RUN!  or maybe there&#39;s a druid you know<br/>
who will drive evac for us)???&gt;<br/>

		I mainly lurk on this list but I feel the time is right for<br/>
me to say something:<br/>
		On Monday Night my Guild Noble Warriors of Norrath went to<br/>
Perma for a bit of hunting/camping, I as a young bard had visions of us<br/>
leaving loaded to the gills with Cryst-blades, icygreaves, silvery axes and<br/>
other assorted plunder.....<br/>
<br/>
		Now I ask you what went wrong?</div>
