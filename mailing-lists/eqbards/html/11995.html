<b>Subject:</b> /tell problems? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-814819067">Had a question for those on the list.  Over the last three<br/>
days...hmmm...that means since the last patch...hmmmm...I have had problems<br/>
receiving /tells.  At least 6 different people have complained that they<br/>
sent me /tells and I never responded.  One of them called me last nite and<br/>
said, &quot;Hey!  wtf.  Are you pissed at me for some reason?&quot;  In total<br/>
consternation I asked him what he was talking about and he said he had been<br/>
sending me /tells for the last 20 minutes and I hadn&#39;t answered a one.  I<br/>
was a city zone at the time so was actually not singing for a change except<br/>
to Carillion various folks looking for new quests.  I was able to scroll<br/>
back all the way to when I logged in and there were no /tells from him.<br/>
This was the 5th person in two days to complain that I was ignoring their<br/>
/tells.  These are all people I play with all the time so the chance they<br/>
mistyped something is nil.  Heck, I work with 3 of them.  I told my friend<br/>
to send me another /tell as soon as he got off his phone.  I waited for 15<br/>
minutes and never saw anything.  I think he gave up in disgust as it was<br/>
getting late, but he hasn&#39;t answered my email yet so I don&#39;t know for<br/>
certain.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else experienced any problems with this or am I the only one<br/>
&#39;going deaf&#39;?<br/>
