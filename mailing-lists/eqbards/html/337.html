<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993713577">Thanks Zend, thats actually the type of answer that I was looking for.  I<br/>
knew I was missing something, but I just didn&#39;t know what it was.  The<br/>
complaining about everything under the sun was a little misdirected,<br/>
however.  Like the majority of my post said, I am happy with Verant.<br/>
<br/>
The expansion pack does still annoy me a little, but then again, I&#39;m only 17<br/>
year old cynic.  I&#39;m not content with the way buisiness is done, but thats<br/>
how it HAS to be done, and so its up to me to deal with it.  Thanks for<br/>
pointing out the timing issues, however:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;LONG after the current bugs are fixed people would be complaining there<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were no MAJOR updates cuz the &gt;expansion would still be a year down the<br/>
road. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right, so I guess they DO need to work on it now.  I&#39;ll just have to hope<br/>
they keep enough staff on the current product to keep it in good order.<br/>

&gt;Whoa. Ease up there Gabriel. Take a look at how many years it takes<br/>
&gt;to develop a game like this. Of course they are working on an<br/>
&gt;expansion. Otherwise, LONG after the current bugs are fixed people<br/>
&gt;would be complaining there were no MAJOR updates cuz the expansion<br/>
&gt;would still be a year down the road. Just because they are looking<br/>
&gt;ahead and planning expansions to the game doesn&#39;t mean they have<br/>
&gt;stopped working on the current issues, they are announcing fixes to<br/>
&gt;existing problems every week on EQ vault and EQ Stratics.<br/>
&gt;Let&#39;s stop complaining about everything under the sun and give Verant<br/>
&gt;some credit for designing the most awesome online game to ever come<br/>
&gt;along.<br/>

&gt;&gt;(I&#39;m 17, and not really into economics, or buisiness, so the<br/>
&gt;following is<br/>
&gt;&gt;all limited speculation on my behalf.  Read at your own discretion,<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt;correct me if you may.  Friendly opinions welcomed too.)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Well, personally I feel that we may be demanding too much out of the<br/>
&gt;company<br/>
&gt;&gt;right now.  Yes, it was realeased as only a portion of what it<br/>
&gt;SHOULD be,<br/>
&gt;&gt;but the entire process...hiring all the help, setting up servers,<br/>
&gt;beta<br/>
&gt;&gt;testing, and everything else, must have cost a FORTUNE compared to<br/>
&gt;what your<br/>
&gt;&gt;average game would cost to produce  (Avg game = Anything not<br/>
&gt;promising lots<br/>
&gt;&gt;of future patches or an evolving world, etc.).<br/>
&gt;&gt;For ANY company, even a subdivision of the super-rich Sony Corp, to<br/>
&gt;invest<br/>
&gt;&gt;enough time and cash into a game like this to get rid of ALL<br/>
&gt;significant<br/>
&gt;&gt;bugs etc. would be an incredible risk for the company.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Well, it took god 6 days to create the world...and on the seventh<br/>
&gt;day he<br/>
&gt;&gt;rested.  Give Brad and the team a break, they are only<br/>
&gt;humans...humans under<br/>
&gt;&gt;the confines of a Sony controlled company, which does have to be<br/>
&gt;careful how<br/>
&gt;&gt;they invest their money.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The only thing that bugs me is that an expansion was already hinted<br/>
&gt;at being<br/>
&gt;&gt;in the works by a Verant employee, and they still have bards<br/>
&gt;strumming a<br/>
&gt;&gt;stick when playing the drums.  Don&#39;t even get me started on the<br/>
&gt;other holes,<br/>
&gt;&gt;you all know what I&#39;m talking about.  If they ARE building an<br/>
&gt;expansion now,<br/>
&gt;&gt;I would stop playing immediatly.  A company that would think of<br/>
&gt;money from<br/>
&gt;&gt;an expansion before bringing quality promised to an existing product<br/>
&gt;has its<br/>
&gt;&gt;priorities WAY off base.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Heres why I think they are working on expansions:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;How much? I can&#39;t get into anything like that because we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;even<br/>
&gt;&gt;really officially announced anything about expansions.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;This was said by Brad McQuaid in response to questions concerning<br/>
&gt;the price<br/>
&gt;&gt;of future expansions.  It definately hints at something going on,<br/>
&gt;but of<br/>
&gt;&gt;course there are no official announcements yet.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;There will be announcements soon about what to expect (well, more<br/>
&gt;like<br/>
&gt;&gt;teasers). I really do wish I could tell you more, because there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;&gt;really cool stuff, but I am not the keeper of PR.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;This was said by Rick Schmitz, artist at Verant, in response to the<br/>
&gt;question<br/>
&gt;&gt;of the possability of an expansion.  It definately hints at it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Oh well, I&#39;ll deal with it when the official announcements are<br/>
&gt;made.  Expect<br/>
&gt;&gt;cussing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Thanks,<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Talk about your vague statements!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Does that mean that when I die in North Karanas, and I run around<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the newbie zone singing Dissonance, killing everything withing<br/>
&gt;sight,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;to get some gold to buy food for the trip back, that I am farming?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;My friend consistenly lures monsters our way with spells, to save<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;us the hassle of chasing it down.  Is this farming?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Here come some more, from the web site:<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;abusing them, such as items that sell for more than they cost to<br/>
&gt;buy.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;OK, this one seems to make some sense.  If an NPC has lost his mind<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;and is selling fine steel swords for 1gp, and buys it back off you<br/>
&gt;for<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;     such as hall blocking, dumping of monsters, or spell effects<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;cross that boundary due to a bug.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Dumping of monsters?!  I&#39;d like someone to prove that I was<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;intentionally dumping the monster, and not just running for the<br/>
&gt;guard.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;But I guess that&#39;s the point, isn&#39;t it?  Verant don&#39;t have to prove<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;anything, do they?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think there is a larger issue here.  In a word, it is &#39;Verant&#39;.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I am impressed with the game, but unimpressed with Verant, on so<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;many levels.  I have come close to cancelling my account once<br/>
&gt;already.<br/>
