<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492520260">Ah, I remember that task well! The guards you seek are Bard Guards, which<br/>
might confuse you a bit. They stand with the other guards but do not wear<br/>
as much armor. The guard at the North Gate can be reached by taking the<br/>
stairs up from either side of the entrance - I cannot remember if it was<br/>
the left or the right. If you have forgotten their names, return to the<br/>
Bard that asked you for the help. He usually stands outside of our<br/>
Guildhall in Qeynos, though I forget his name at this time.<br/>

Good luck and happy questing!<br/>

&gt;Hail, fellow bards. I am Boru, Half-Elf Bard of Innoruk. I am a mere level<br/>

and Docks of Qeynos. I  can not find the steps to reach the ramparts at the<br/>
North Gate, and I can not find the Guard at the Docks. Can anyone help?<br/>
