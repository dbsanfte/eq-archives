&gt; speaking of fear/chain, i was running to rathe mountains and on my way from<br/>

&gt; I start pounding away at him with my normal buff songs and he&#39;s doing about<br/>
&gt; the same damage as i am than he is to me, well to hell with this, i chain<br/>
&gt; him down and fear him, so i took off about half his health using fear, this<br/>
&gt; tactic is great against cyclops when ya get a druid to snare it, then fear<br/>
&gt; it and just pound away. Its sad when a level 14 npc is pounding the hell out<br/>
&gt; of a 31th level pc. I just decided to not take any chances with him. And<br/>

level mobs against high level PCs within the last week.  I<br/>
used to regularly kick Dorn around from mid 20s on, losing at<br/>
most two bubbles.  He&#39;d usually ding me for 1-2 points with an<br/>
occasional 20+ getting through.  Now he&#39;s hitting regularly<br/>
for 20+.  Same thing with Kizdean Gix - I used to solo him<br/>
just because.  The last couple times he&#39;s sent me running<br/>
unless I use chain/fear.  I barely soloed Dragoon Zytl two<br/>
weeks ago, but I&#39;m not even going to bother trying now.  Gotta<br/>
love these unannounced changes.  It&#39;s funny to read Brad<br/>
saying most of the uber-mobs have been removed, when these<br/>
guys were recently upgraded.<br/>

master after I charmed it.  I think I&#39;ll send it into EQ<br/>
Vault.  Too bad there wasn&#39;t a giant nearby...<br/>
