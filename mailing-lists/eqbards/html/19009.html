<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884398095">Some lessons about the shrooms... they seem to pop up when you have been<br/>
fighting at the zone for a long time. Like when you are waiting for the last<br/>
team member to arrive. We used to just join up and head in at this point and<br/>
always ran into a shroom train. Now we camp out (EVERYBODY thx bard agro<br/>
transfer) right before going in and voila, havent seen a shroom since (well<br/>
till we went actively looking for them anyways :)<br/>
<br/>
Note the above info might be pure bull sheet and just random luck on our<br/>
part... hardly scientific :)<br/>

And 54 sucks. Mah god it was painful. Finally made 55 and lemme tell you, i<br/>
woulda rather gone through 51-53 again than 54. Though the new xp patch<br/>
helped a ton, before it was just too painful to contemplate. Anyways 55<br/>
seems to be a lot easier, i am already half a bubble into it after just a<br/>
few hours pulling like mad in skyfire with a rogue/necro to back me  up :)<br/>

&gt; that&#39;s not bad in a group with everyone higher level than you.  i think<br/>
&gt; before the patch it took me about 4 hours to get half a bubble, and the<br/>
&gt; other night i got 3/4 bubb in the same time.  but now in 54 it is just<br/>
&gt; extremely slow, worse than 51.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Compared to what it was - yes, I guess so but I spent 8 hours<br/>
&gt; &gt; yesterday in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sebilis with a full group (granted there were 2 54&#39;s, another<br/>
&gt; &gt; who became 54,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 53, 1 52 and me 51) for 1 bubble of exp. (sigh)<br/>
