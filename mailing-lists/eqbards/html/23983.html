<div id="ygrps-yiv-152924827"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;When someone says Bards are overpowered, they&#39;re making a comparison <br/>
&gt;of a well played Bard vs. a well played &lt;whatever class&gt;.  That <br/>
&gt;comparison _ignores_ that Bards are inherently more difficult to play <br/>
&gt;well.  <br/>
&gt;When you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>
&gt;playing the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>
&gt;different comparisons, really.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s definitely an elitist point of view.  You might as well say that a<br/>
good bard player is inherently a better player than a good druid player can<br/>
ever be because a bard is so much harder to play.  By your definition a gun<br/>
isn&#39;t more powerful than a sword, because a sword is harder to use<br/>
effectively.  If it is easier to accomplish the same thing with two<br/>
different tools, but is easier with tool A than with tool B, then tool A is<br/>
by definition more powerful than Tool B.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, they&#39;re saying &quot;that&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and I&#39;m saying, &quot;Yeah, too bad each<br/>
plant only produces 1.&quot;  For an equal amount of effort, not skill<br/>
necessarily, bards get far less return than other classes.<br/>
