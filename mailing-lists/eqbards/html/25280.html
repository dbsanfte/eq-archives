<br/>
Well, last night, after months of not even trying to work on it, I<br/>
finished my<br/>
Singing Short Sword quest. :)  A guild-mate won a scale on  a Vox raid a<br/>
couple<br/>
weeks ago, and that was the turning point for me.  We had I think 9<br/>
consecutive<br/>
Vox kills with only 1 white scale dropped.  It&#39;s been rough on MM ;p.</div>
