<div id="ygrps-yiv-693982835">this is it for me for the day.  going to actually try to play barring<br/>
unforeseen griffene tupperware parties at zone lines.  I think at some point<br/>
Verant will have to decide how to keep players in the game who have less<br/>
time to play on a regular basis and still keep those more fortunate  ones<br/>
who can play more interested.  Those with more time run out of challenges,<br/>
those with less time are challenged to advance.  They only have so many<br/>
resources, if they don&#39;t address this issue they will lose a valuable part<br/>
of the player base either way you look at it.  What is going to happen when<br/>
Kunark comes online with an evil city?  Will there be a place for the good<br/>
races to bind or will Verant see it as a challenge for good players to<br/>
adventure there since its a boat ride from their nearest reasonable bind<br/>
point if they aren&#39;t a binder?  Given their lack of forethought in some<br/>
other areas I am not convinced they will deal with this issue well.<br/>

the same for Kitasi, and i do understand.  and like you said, i play more<br/>
and thus can not relate to death in the same way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; As I have said before, for casual gamers who don&#39;t get <br/>
&gt; to play EQ<br/>
&gt; that much, not being able to bind in non-cities has a major <br/>
&gt; impact.  When I<br/>
&gt; die, that pretty much writes off the rest of the gaming <br/>
&gt; session for me.<br/>
&gt; Thats why I support a change to the policy.  <br/>
