<div id="ygrps-yiv-436742051">Ok, I buy into this but in the &#39;real world&#39; errr &#39;cuse me in Norrath when<br/>
you are in a party and u got a healer - I think it would be good to have<br/>
some hvy dmg blades be swinging as well as some lighter but fast ones.  Does<br/>
having more ppl swing the weps make a diffierence?<br/>

p.s. plus it does look impressive to see your pallie pal lean back and heft<br/>
that BIBS or your evil SK cousin whacking away with that dark reaver - <br/>

		Lowering deviation from average however, does increase<br/>
predictability which<br/>
		means less dying.  The faster weapon means you&#39;ll die less<br/>
from mobs you<br/>
		have easily killed before, while with a higher damage weapon<br/>
you&#39;ll<br/>
		sometimes easily beat a white con andthen get thoroughly<br/>
trounced by the<br/>
		same white con the very next time.  Fast weapons are the<br/>
best defense<br/>
		against clumpy random number generation.  Missing 5 times in<br/>
a row with my<br/>
		Dirk is meaningless in a fight where I have to hit 100 times<br/>
anyway.<br/>
		Missing 5 straight times with a delay 45 weapon is<br/>
equivalent to 10 plus<br/>
		straght misses  and will cause death.  Of course 5 straight<br/>
hits are as<br/>
		advantageous as the misses are disad., but its the lack of<br/>
predictability<br/>
		that kills.  Can I take this blue dangerous?  Only if I<br/>
don&#39;t get bad luck,<br/>
		whereas with the faster wepon you generally know what you<br/>
can handle and<br/>
		can&#39;t after trying it once.<br/>

		I still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>
		only lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re<br/>
more<br/>
		likely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>
		thing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A<br/>
higher<br/>
		deviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>
		you&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>
		as more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>

		I agreed with John here.  The higher dmg weapon is better<br/>
than the faster<br/>
		weapon when the dmg ratio are the same.  I used to used a<br/>
Demon claw and a<br/>
		Silver war axe.  That was fast.  But now that I have the<br/>
crystalline blade<br/>
		and the black enamel mace I find the later weapons a lot<br/>
more efficient.  I<br/>
		have no scientific facts except that with the Crys blade and<br/>
mace the MOBs<br/>
		seems to hate me a lot more than when I was fighting with<br/>
Claw and axe.<br/>
