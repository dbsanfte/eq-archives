<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736676973">ok it&#39;s not that light a gray, it is definitely darker than that.  i don&#39;t<br/>
want to say charcoal gray, cause i think charred is closer to charcoal gray<br/>
than is black.  but it is in between black and gray.  rune etched is a lot<br/>
lighter than the granite bracer.  the bracer is definitely not black, though<br/>
it&#39;s as close as you will get.  and as far as rarity, i don&#39;t know but i&#39;ve<br/>
only seen one ever hehe.<br/>
