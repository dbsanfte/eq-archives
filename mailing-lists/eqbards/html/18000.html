<div id="ygrps-yiv-695419956">Ahhh good old HK, man oh man have I spent hours and hours in there...<br/>
<br/>
In HK there are 5 spots in order of increasing difficulty: Lookout room (2<br/>
spawn), Guard room (3 or 4 spawn), Warrior room (3 or 4 spawn), Ramp (1 or 2<br/>
spawn) & Raider room (4 spawn).  At 27, you can get exp in War room or<br/>
Raider room.  Depending on how many in the group and who well they have the<br/>
spawn separated in time, you can be fighting singles or multiples.  A full<br/>
group with some decent healing can prolly handle even a 3 spawn if they<br/>
/assist and kill quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Even though you hear alot of casting from other rooms (up stairs, etc), AE<br/>
is quite safe to use in HK pickclaw rooms.  never once have I pulled or<br/>
agro&#39;d an &quot;accountant&quot; or any of the names you hear casting from the<br/>
pickclaw rooms.  Sometimes mobs will get trained to the guards and the<br/>
guards will chase resetting mobs down to the ramp even and then you have to<br/>
be carefull.  More than once, I chased a train up to the guards and oppsie!<br/>
I had Largos playing and Capt Bozek took exception to his part time worker<br/>
(me).  But down in the rooms with with multi-mobs, AE is fine as long as you<br/>
coordinate with the others in your group.  Ie, if use /assist and dont<br/>
cancel each others spells (chain vs snare vs darkness, largos vs other<br/>
slowing spells, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
If you have a good healer, you might want to try all instrument attack: CoD,<br/>
DDD, Largos and swap lute and brass horn. Or CoD, Hymn, DDD.  The psalm of<br/>
warmth and the damage shield is a good thought.  When I was tank heavy, I<br/>
played chant and guardian with a drum for tank stats and ac and mr as you<br/>
get some caster gobs too.  And I would tell my group to look at their stats<br/>
when i was playing with drum equipped so they could see the great effects<br/>
(little did they know that agi dex were not really doing all that much.) So,<br/>
in retrospect, Anthem with the wep speed buff is maybe better.<br/>
<br/>
Also, something I think that gets overlooked is Jig.  If your group is<br/>
swinging heavy weps and losing sta, they may not realize what happens -<br/>
their dmg goes down as their speed gets slower.  Yes, they keep swinging but<br/>
they get slower and slower.  So, find out if they are dropping below a bub<br/>
of sta and have jig ready to weave in for a few ticks and you can keep their<br/>
dmg output maxxed.<br/>
<br/>
At level 27, you have 3 songs that can do damage: CoD (2), BBB (12) & DDD<br/>
(18).  You could go with all 3 and instruments and see:  18 + 15 + 23 for 56<br/>
max dmg per tick or 560 dmg per minute.  You probably need a good healer to<br/>
keep you alive if there are 2 or more gobs in the fight.  So, perhaps have 2<br/>
tactics, all instrument max damage for single mob fights and party buff/dmg<br/>
shield & largos to slow for multi-mob fights.  Also, it will depend on the<br/>
room you are in.  In the raider room mobs will resist more.  In the war room<br/>
or guard room, they will be lower levels and your songs will stick better.<br/>
You need to have a different strategy for fighting reds vs fighting blues -<br/>
generally you switch to more melee and party buff/heal for the yellow and<br/>
reds (and dmg shields are not usually resisted so they are always good).<br/>

songs at various levels.<br/>
<br/>
There are some ideas for you - good luck and let us know what works best for<br/>
you.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Highpass Keep<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I know we have covered this before but I have been looking for a while and<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t find the thread. I am looking for Highpass Keep strategies (at level<br/>
&gt; 27). I seem to recall Area Effect songs are okay...and if nothing else if<br/>
&gt; that is false I would appreciate a heads up :o)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TIA,<br/>
