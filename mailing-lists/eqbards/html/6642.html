<div id="ygrps-yiv-235647600">The real problem with all the changes, as I see it, is that they don&#39;t tell<br/>
anyone beforehand so that they don&#39;t get stuck in a tight spot. Do they<br/>
think we won&#39;t notice if they don&#39;t say anything?<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t read the patch messages, and they get stuck, then it&#39;s<br/>
thier own fault, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Verant always says how they think through every change thoroughly, but these<br/>
seem to have skipped that process. How hard is it to foresee the problems<br/>
people would have, especially with the Box? And if these decisions were so<br/>
well though out, why did they reverse them so quickly?<br/>
<br/>
It all seems rather obvious.<br/>

&gt; however, that if you are high enough level to have that kind of item,<br/>
you<br/>

decent,<br/>
&gt; (not from fear plane of course ;-) again (as in the box) fair warning<br/>

It&#39;s not that simple.  If they&#39;d warned us, all the people who<br/>
had these items would&#39;ve been pawning them off for exhorbitant<br/>
sums of money to people who hadn&#39;t seen or missed the warning.<br/>

This is yet another example of a rule to MUD design that I&#39;ve<br/>
been espousing to the UO developers:  Never give the players<br/>
something you may have to take away in the future.<br/>
