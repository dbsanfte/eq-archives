 </span></blockquote>To cast the magic you pick, say, a merchant you wish to influence.  You<br/>
target that merchant and sing.  If the song works you&#39;ll see a glow on the<br/>
merchant similar to when you&#39;re singing the Accelerando and you&#39;ll feel a<br/>
wave of enchantment washing over you.  The song will end itself.<br/>
<br/>
When I do it I target the merchant and consider their reaction to me, sing<br/>
the song, and consider again.  I typically see apprehensive turn to amiable.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Any idea where I can get a silk evening shirt and a cats eye amulet, and<br/>
&gt;what&#39;ll they cost me? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe both were purchased in Kelethin from adventurers making public<br/>
offers.  As I recall I paid 5 platinum for the shirt.  A cleric friend of<br/>
mine bought me the amulet as a gift for 1 platinum.  He said I&#39;ve saved far<br/>
more than that for him, using his money to buy him his spell scrolls at his<br/>
own guild.  It seems the merchants there give me better prices even than<br/>
one of thier own.<br/>
<br/>
This past evening I made several platinum in commissions, spending a<br/>
friend&#39;s money for him to buy fletching supples.  I can save him over a<br/>
platinum on an ash bow staff and keep a platinum for myself, so we&#39;re both<br/>
way ahead, since I get it for more than two platinum less than he does, on<br/>
an item that costs me just a bit over 15 platinum.  Quite a savings, eh?<br/>
