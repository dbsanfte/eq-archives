&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ever since I moved to bronze plate (slowly switching it with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;steel plate), I get the impression that mobs get an attack<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bonus if you are close to encumbered but not there yet.  I am<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Could this be the working of the anti-twink code? Maybe it truly<br/>
&gt; takes levels (and thus more defense skill) to use heavier armors<br/>
&gt; properly. I also had the impression that when I switched to banded<br/>
&gt; now, at lvl10, I got hit harder a bit. Of course, people get heavier<br/>
&gt; armor for themselves without any aid from others too, but maybe<br/>
&gt; it does not pay to be fit in the best you can afford, but in the best<br/>
&gt; you can use =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t start getting banded until L16, and didn&#39;t start<br/>
getting bronze until L21.  Didn&#39;t finish out my bronze until<br/>
L26.  I would assume that is around the level Verant intended<br/>
us to get bronze since the mobs that carry them in Unrest are<br/>
now all blue to me.  Despite all the testing I like to do to<br/>
figure out the the programming behind the game, I am not a<br/>
consummate powergamer.<br/>
