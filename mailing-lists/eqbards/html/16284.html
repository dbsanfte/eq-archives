&gt; The postings made it clear its worse than that.  If a room has two named<br/>
&gt; spawns a second group can freely waltz in and demand to be allowed to camp<br/>
&gt; one of the named spawns.  If its a room with two different items that<br/>
&gt; different classes in your group wants, suddenly part of your group has<br/>
&gt; nothing to gain from camping the room and will likely leave in disgust after<br/>
&gt; this happens two or three times.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I think most of you guys are looking at worst-case<br/>
scenarios.  e.g. you really really want this item and have<br/>
been spending hours camping it, someone comes in and demands<br/>
to share the spawn, and he gets the item on the next spawn.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the big picture, the mobs still spawn at the<br/>
same rate, the number of rare items dropped per day is still<br/>
the same.  The only thing that&#39;s changed is who has access to<br/>
them.  The &quot;group at the camp owns the spawn until they leave<br/>
or die&quot; system favors those with lots of playtime - folks who<br/>
can get a room early while the servers are uncrowded, and hold<br/>
it until late at night.  With the new rules, people without as<br/>
much time to play, or heaven forbid people dungeon crawling,<br/>
will have access to camped spawns.  Yes someone might demand<br/>
you share your SMR camp and get it ahead of you, but now you<br/>
can demand someone share their SMR camp with you, instead of<br/>
waiting 2 weeks for a free spot.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the transition is going to be rather harsh.  <br/>
People who try to be nice and respect the old rules are going<br/>
to get screwed because they&#39;ll never want to &quot;impose&quot; the new<br/>
rule on others, while others will impose it on them.  Folks<br/>
who break difficult spawns are also not going to be adequately<br/>
rewarded (though my philosophy is to kill everything ASAP, and<br/>
if someone who can&#39;t handle it demands to share, just invis or<br/>
move back and let him at it).<br/>
<br/>
And the fundamental problem is still overcrowding and static<br/>
named mobs.<br/>
