He spawns way back in a cove &quot;near Jonas the hermits cabin&quot; - I followed a<br/>
loc someone shouted - its past the barbies and pretty far back in a deep<br/>
cove.<br/>
<br/>
Ok - so I can see him and he cons blue to me at 30.  I call for my 26 ranger<br/>
friend who is in zone to come help.  Some one said dispell him and he is no<br/>
problem - well ok but I don&#39;t got a song for that. So, I buff us and played<br/>
guardian rythmns. The ranger gave us enduring breath.  Webbie is a nasty<br/>
caster and burned the hell out of my ranger pal - he died infact.  Now its<br/>
me and webbie about half and half in health.  I am just not getting hits on<br/>
him trying to melee in the water.  The only damage song I got loaded is<br/>
Bellow - so I apply it liberally and this does him in.  I finished the fight<br/>
with less that a bub of hp left.  Very close call.  With 20-20 hind sight, I<br/>
can see that there is a green crock swimming nearby which would have been<br/>
death if he got into the  melee (if I had used AE chords for example)<br/>
<br/>
Got the watercrystal staff 5dam/28dly wt 6. I am back to trying to raise my<br/>
1HB - average now &lt;sigh&gt; all you young bards - max all of your skills - all<br/>
the way up - you will be glad you did!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>		I had never heard that.  I have been there several times,<br/>
and Webclaw has been<br/>
		there 90% of the time (no triggers needed) and the other 10%<br/>
were placeholders.<br/>
		(The placeholder is Green to Webclaw, or damn close to it)<br/>
<br/>
		I apologize for the thing about having to fight him<br/>
underwater, but watching my<br/>
		friend fight him (lvl 34 druid) he could not pull him out of<br/>
the water.  he<br/>
		tried 3 times and all three times he 32K&#39;d.  so, he just<br/>
killed him underwater<br/>
		and had no problems.  I know the Underwater AI has some<br/>
*Issues* so maybe he<br/>
		was just doing things in a way that it didn&#39;t like.<br/>
