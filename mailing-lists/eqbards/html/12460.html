<div id="ygrps-yiv-580977088">Another update for you speed freaks:<br/>
<br/>
Having run past GrimFeather a few days ago and made it safely to zone, I got <br/>
cocky.  Last night I was killing time waiting for a friend and picked GF up <br/>
on track again.  I decided I&#39;d try to kite him (level 36, MM drums, using <br/>
Fufil&#39;s because the range is sooooo much better than Bellow) and got a nasty <br/>
surprise.  Yes, I am faster than him.  No, I am not fast enough to kite him <br/>
- even very shallow turns brought me into his range (which is a lot farther <br/>
than other griffs - more like a giant).  He hits *at least* as hard as HGs, <br/>
and seems to double attack a lot more.  Well, I ended up in a crumpled blue <br/>
heap on a hillside in NK, and learned a little humility. = )  I have rather <br/>
a lot of experience kiting (made most of my experience from 15 to 21 that <br/>
way), and I must admit that this is something toward the top of my &quot;must do <br/>
someday&quot; list - gotta prove to myself I can do it.  On the other hand, I&#39;m <br/>
not suicidal, and I&#39;ll wait until 40+ and maybe upgrade to Selo&#39;s Drum <br/>
first... &lt;drool&gt;<br/>
