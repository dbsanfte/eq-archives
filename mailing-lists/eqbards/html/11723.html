it&#39;s possible to simply clear your way there, but there would be some very<br/>
nasty fights.  Try to have someone who can pull singles, either from<br/>
knowledge of the zone or high enough archery.<br/>

The area behind the music room is somewhat safe.  I went in with a 50<br/>
druid who knew the area very well, so I just let him do his thing.  For<br/>
everyone in guilds, see if there&#39;s someone who&#39;s experienced in<br/>
Mistmoorian pulling, and make sure they come along.<br/>

I went in a week ago to help a paladin get his Soulfire hilt.  The SK that<br/>
drops it is in the jacuzzi room, which we reached via the secret room<br/>
entrance to the castle.  While sitting around waiting for him to spawn, I<br/>
got HT&#39;d.  One mob came through the door.  Ok we thought, no big deal.<br/>
Then another came.  Then another.  Then at least 20 more gargs, ancilles,<br/>
ushers, thought spoilers all piled into this teensy room.  The wiz, who<br/>
hadn&#39;t cast yet, was able to get off the port to faydark before anyone<br/>
dropped.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely not a place to visit on a whim.<br/>
