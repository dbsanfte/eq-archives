&gt; &gt;So does that mean you&#39;ve quit playing EQ or you have retired from your RL<br/>
&gt; &gt;job?  Not good if its #1, congrats if its #2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, the first.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but after spending the last 2 weeks<br/>
&gt; gaining a half a bubble slowly over several hours, only to lose it in an<br/>
&gt; instant at LEAST 6 times a day - I just got too frustrated.  I was trying<br/>
&gt; to play by Brad&#39;s rules: group or die, so I was grouping, everywhere.<br/>

If you really can&#39;t stand it anymore, it&#39;s a shame, but I&#39;ll wish you well.  I would like to say,<br/>
though, that level 22 was my WORST level by far.  I died eight times (that I can distinctly<br/>
remember, probably more), for many of the reasons you cited.  Three in one miserable night, four<br/>
in one utterly miserable night.  Other people will have other solutions, but the two things that<br/>
helped me through it were High Keep basement (hehe) and getting into a guild.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN&#39;T fight in High Keep without a group (unless you are a very high level KSer) because all<br/>
the other players there won&#39;t stand for it (and you&#39;ll croak).  You&#39;ll meet a LOT of people, and<br/>
you&#39;ll have the time to instruct them in proper play.  (Some will get it, some won&#39;t get it, but<br/>
it&#39;s safe enough that you won&#39;t die anyway, so who cares?  It&#39;s a good way to make a list of<br/>
competent players for later on.  Plus, they love Bards.)  Like I said, it&#39;s a bubble every 2-3<br/>
hours, depending on circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Getting into a guild is a REALLY useful thing for those of you (like myself) who can&#39;t play much<br/>
and don&#39;t level as fast as their friends.  I could probably get on tonight, /guildsay Anyone want<br/>
to help me get Lambent Vambrances?  and get a positive response.  (I won&#39;t because I&#39;m shooting<br/>
for level 32.)  Make sure the guild is big, and make sure it has a lot of high levels (they<br/>
didn&#39;t get there by playing stupidly).<br/>
