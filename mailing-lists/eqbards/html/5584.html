&gt; Well it&#39;s me again. I&#39;m sorry if my appology about my english <br/>
&gt; is bothering<br/>
&gt; you but I said that because I mean it. The fact is that I got <br/>
&gt; a few mails<br/>
&gt; about my language and they weren&#39;t very pleasent to read. If <br/>
&gt; you think my<br/>
&gt; english is good enough then I can say just one thing. Thanks <br/>
&gt; god at least<br/>
&gt; one. Beleive me this is the first mail in which my english is <br/>
&gt; mentioned as<br/>
&gt; something good. So I&#39;ll never write that appology about my <br/>
&gt; language again.<br/>
&gt; I hope I didn&#39;t iritate you to much, If I did then I&#39;m sorry <br/>
&gt; I just wanted<br/>
&gt; to help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; Does it ever bother anyone else that people who say, &quot;Sorry <br/>
&gt; if you couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand, English isn&#39;t my first language,&quot; often speak <br/>
&gt; more coherently<br/>
&gt; &gt; than about 70 -80% of the people whose first language it <br/>
&gt; is?  I mean, I meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who have been speaking English their entire lives, <br/>
&gt; and I guess its<br/>
&gt; &gt; just degraded from over use.  For all of those people out <br/>
&gt; there who think<br/>
&gt; &gt; they aren&#39;t being understood, don&#39;t worry about it, chances <br/>
&gt; are you get your<br/>
&gt; &gt; points across more clearly than we naturals do :)<br/>
