<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581585975">Seems the consensus for most of us including myself is to twist during<br/>
fights without swapping around a lot and not to twist during downtime.<br/>
However, I will twist in downtime if low mana, lots of low hp folks and/or<br/>
no healer - Clarity and HOR - situation dependent and the exception.  And I<br/>
am about to get second chant(should ding 38 tonight) so I might again try<br/>
using horn/drum combo as described in another message.  I have swapped<br/>
equipment and know I can do it, but most times I decide not to.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, seems as if Bards tend to be older, at least for this small sample<br/>
replying.  I am 38 and also very much enjoy the social interactions that go<br/>
with EQ(and the wood elf druid I flirt with I have heard in Yahoo chat -<br/>
very female).  I have friends from all over the world and from as young as<br/>
13(in my guild and actually a very good player) to as old as, well, how old<br/>
are you Ken?  Anyway, I like to think all of you on this list are my friends<br/>
and include this as part of the EQ society.  As for age making you sleepy, I<br/>
don&#39;t know if it is age or the fact I am up by 6 AM every morning and don&#39;t<br/>
get to log in until usually after 10 PM(last kid in bed).  I usually end my<br/>
night with the statement:  I am doing the headbob and if I keep this up, I<br/>
will plant some keys in my forehead.  Hehe.  Never ended up at the bottom of<br/>
a moat due to falling asleep, but my wife enticed me there once(first time<br/>
in City of Mist, fell in moat, couldn&#39;t get out(I now know it is easy) and<br/>
wife decides to get home at the most inopportune moment - Get off now!!<br/>
situation - Lol).  I didn&#39;t have EB memmed, but I didn&#39;t die thankfully.<br/>
Those of us with significant others understand how that sometimes happens.<br/>

Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt whose main is a bard<br/>
(an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and there... &quot;less<br/>
talking more twisting!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three to four songs<br/>
but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.  <br/>
 <br/>
Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>
question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>
 <br/>
I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory slots, and #2 bank<br/>
set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, switch to #1, switch<br/>
out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new song without<br/>
missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one of those things<br/>
that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to switch hotkey<br/>
banks...<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, btw, play with people 8 levels lower than you!  I played with a monk my<br/>
level and a warrior 8 levels higher.  He went through 40 in the same amount<br/>
of time it took us to go through 34 (about 3.5 hours).  Sick.<br/>

	I&#39;ve been playing EQ since release - and have just dinged to 51.  I<br/>
have<br/>
never switched weapons during combat.  I agree with Rokenn that it&#39;s only<br/>
for the most dedicated player.  Maybe it also has to do with age (I&#39;m 38)<br/>
and lack of finger dexterity (I find it enough work to twist 3 songs)!<br/>
<br/>
	Also - I don&#39;t view leveling as a race.  The fact that other people<br/>
level a<br/>
lot faster than I do doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
	It&#39;s a game - it&#39;s about having fun.  As Rokenn pointed out for many<br/>
of<br/>
us - the social aspect is as important or more important than the<br/>
accumulation of levels and items (please don&#39;t anyone view this as a flame -<br/>
if that is your playing styles that cool and great - just a matter of<br/>
personal taste!)<br/>
<br/>
	I pretty much ALWAYS twist in combat - and never in down-time.  In<br/>
certain<br/>
situations I will - but its very much the exception not the rule.  I need to<br/>
do some socializing and rest the fingers!<br/>

<br/>
Constant swapping for instruments and weapons is only for the truely insane.<br/>
I may switch back and forth during a battle as is called for, but not<br/>
constantly.  You might want to remind your groupmate that EQ is after all a<br/>
social game and it is impossible to be social while twisting constantly.  If<br/>
I am in a group and all is well, I have no problem only leaving one song<br/>
playing so I can chat with my friends, in group, tells, or guildsay.  So<br/>
tell that monk to relax =)<br/>
