<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944929956">The absolutely scariest zone I have ever played in was a low levelled<br/>
Erudite in Tox forest<br/>
<br/>
the combined darkness and the fact that there were lots of &quot;skeleton&#39;s&quot;<br/>
running around scared me quite a bit.<br/>

&gt; I didn&#39;t think about it until later, but from the time I<br/>
&gt; entered Kithicor to the time I left, I did not SEE one<br/>
&gt; single critter. No beetle. No bat. No nothing. He told me<br/>
&gt; that he thought the zone was &quot;haunted&quot; in more ways than<br/>
&gt; one. At the time, I laughed, thinking that he was taking<br/>
&gt; the game a little too seriously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, after hearing other stories from fellow bards, I<br/>
&gt; realize he could very well be right. </span></blockquote></div>
