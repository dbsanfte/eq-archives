Ups returned to work and saw 25 messages in the bards list.. Thought they<br/>
REALLY did screw something up.. And then it was my little bad joke that gave<br/>
reason to some of these messages ;)<br/>
Btw. Ive been playing my bard since april 2 1999. So he must qualify as an<br/>
old bard, hehe. Im just a casual player so Im still only 48th level, but Ive<br/>
been on this list for a loonnnnggg time. I remember when the guy from verant<br/>
and the tester roamed around. Those where the days with lots of good info<br/>
and communications bards around norrath, forgotten their names though.<br/>
<br/>
Musiker, bertox<br/>

&gt; Hehe - man I need to learn not to respond to the list before <br/>
&gt; my first cup of<br/>
&gt; coffee in the morning...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I like the Spit Valve of Doom - and there will be different values - a<br/>
&gt; trumpet gives smallest affect while a tuba the biggest!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW - not to get into another debate on mino horns - but the <br/>
&gt; trombone is a<br/>
&gt; Brass Inst not a Wind Inst.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also - I think there should be Wind Instrument &quot;Sax of <br/>
&gt; Gorelick&quot; which has a<br/>
&gt; negative affect on all wind songs EXCEPT mez songs - in which <br/>
&gt; case the mez<br/>
&gt; is never resisted and has an indefinite duration...<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s ok, to make it up to Slyde, Verant has included in this patch a<br/>
&gt; trombone. It enhances wind songs and they&#39;ve added a special <br/>
&gt; disorienting<br/>
&gt; attack called &quot;Spit Valve of Doom&quot; which causes all mobs that <br/>
&gt; chase a bard<br/>
&gt; to slip and slide.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Slyde ole brother of song.. the lad was making a jest. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Actually the reason for the deaths had nothing to do with <br/>
&gt; aria. It was<br/>
&gt; &gt;part of a series of &quot;fixes&quot; to prevent chain and over <br/>
&gt; casting that broke<br/>
&gt; &gt;bards.  All bard songs were effected Aria was the only one <br/>
&gt; that got people<br/>
&gt; &gt;killed.  No bard songs would refresh so you got one pulse <br/>
&gt; had to stop the<br/>
&gt; &gt;song and then had to restart it.  Aria at the time had about <br/>
&gt; 4 seconds of<br/>
&gt; &gt;duration beyond the pulse just enough to get you out of <br/>
&gt; safty and into a<br/>
&gt; &gt;long drop :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;The next batch which fixed that problem then made it that <br/>
&gt; weapons would<br/>
&gt; &gt;not proc while bard song was active.  That took them about a <br/>
&gt; week or so to<br/>
&gt; &gt;fix.  The lists go on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Our Aria still will allow us to gain altitude and so does caster<br/>
&gt; &gt;recasting.  However there is now a &quot;glass celling&quot; that <br/>
&gt; dictates how high<br/>
&gt; &gt;you can go in a specific area.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem we old bards are talking about has nothing to <br/>
&gt; do with Selos<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Arie of Eagles stacking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; At one time non bards could cast their levitate spells <br/>
&gt; before they ran<br/>
&gt; out;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; which made the levitate higher - so they could use <br/>
&gt; multiple casts to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Climb&quot;.  Verant nerfed it by requiring it to completely <br/>
&gt; end before<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recasting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This broke our levitate song.  The second and subsequent <br/>
&gt; pulse of AOE<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; assume Selo&#39;s Traveling - didn&#39;t have it then) wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; work until it<br/>
&gt; ran<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out and you fell.  The unlucky bards who found this out <br/>
&gt; the hard way -<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; used the song THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK often fell <br/>
&gt; to their death.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It was clear that Verant made a change to the spell <br/>
&gt; system without doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ANY testing on the bard class.        Literally 19 <br/>
&gt; seconds of testing<br/>
&gt; &gt; would have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; caught this bug.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t add to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; affect of Selo&#39;s. Again - many bards died expecting their <br/>
&gt; songs to work<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they way they were designed (i.e. running away from mobs <br/>
&gt; etc). In this<br/>
&gt; case<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - 3 seconds of testing would have caught it. They <br/>
&gt; admitted it was a<br/>
&gt; bug -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but refused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They <br/>
&gt; said it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; critical enough (we were upset about this wondering the <br/>
&gt; reaction from<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; player base is SOW was broken...)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a <br/>
&gt; half-dozen or<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending <br/>
&gt; to affect Bards<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that were introduced into the live servers because the <br/>
&gt; most trivial<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of testing the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Heck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by <br/>
&gt; players and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a <br/>
&gt; nessesary nerf because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bards would outrun guides and make fun of them. Now the <br/>
