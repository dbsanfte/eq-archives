<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Player wipe on Test <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061514053">My concern is this: How long will it take players of the less-common<br/>
classes (in particular Bards and Rogues) get to higher levels to test the<br/>
songs/skills etc that only come at the high-level.<br/>
<br/>
	I heard (here?) that Verant&#39;s in-house testing group is four.  We know<br/>
their ability to test Bard songs is poor to non-existent (levitate change<br/>
for example).  So basically - the one stopgap hope we have for changes that<br/>
affect songs is gone until the few people that play bards (or fill in other<br/>
class) on the test server enough to get to level X...<br/>
<br/>
	This shows very poor foresight.<br/>
<br/>
	As far as conjecture - I wonder if Verant is planning on making a major<br/>
change (database?) that is dramatically changing some sort of data structure<br/>
and wants to put the change into the test server before they write the<br/>
conversion program.  If so - doesn&#39;t give me much confidence on the data<br/>
(i.e. high-level chars) they are testing that conversion with...<br/>
