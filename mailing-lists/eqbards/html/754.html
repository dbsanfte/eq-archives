<b>Subject:</b> Bardic Travel Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044055900">I keep hearing two opposing statements about travel.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m fast, I can outrun a griffin (sometimes), but then I hear if<br/>
I want to go to Qeynos there are two options. Either RunnEye or High<br/>
Hold Pass. I hear in HighHold there are gnolls who will kill me and in<br/>
RunnEye I&#39;ll have 10 creatures trained on me. I don&#39;t like to train, nor<br/>
do I like to die. So please let me know, whats the safest way for a<br/>
level 10 Bard to travel from Freeport to Qeynos.<br/>
