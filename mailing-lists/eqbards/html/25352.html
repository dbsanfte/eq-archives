<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102113097">Well, you guys asked me to let you know what I got for the Horn in the <br/>
end.  To bring you up to date, I lucked into a Horn of Hsagra, doing a <br/>
low-level quest in Ak&#39;Anon (probably due to a loot-table mixup).  I offered <br/>
it to a friend of mine who is in a guild, and he said to write my own <br/>
ticket.  So I did.  I requested the Lute of the Howler, and some coins for <br/>
the Nostrolo Tambourine quest.  I didn&#39;t expect to get all of that, but I <br/>
was hopeful.<br/>
<br/>
Today I got a call, requesting my presence in West Commons.  There, I was <br/>
presented, in trade for the Horn, a bag containing one Lute of the Howler, <br/>
6 Ancient Coins, and 18 peridots.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say I did well.<br/>

P.S. What level can I use the Lute&#39;s illusion?</div>
