<div id="ygrps-yiv-78969768">Yes I know that it was an ancient curse, interesting given a meaning of <br/>
times of upheavals, wars, etc. Pretty much applies to Norrath I think and <br/>
not being a farmer-type I really Like Interesting Times. I perfer them <br/>
definitely. I even think of my time in Faydark and Oasis as the Orc wars, <br/>
Runnyeye and HighHold are the Goblin wars, etc. Besides, what work for a <br/>
Bard if not for interesting times?<br/>
Also I had to see how long it would run before someone picked up on it. <br/>
Congratulations! Proves that this has to be one very intelligent group for <br/>
anyone to have picked that up, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
May you live in Interesting times,<br/>
