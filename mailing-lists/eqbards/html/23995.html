It is arrogant to assume that everyone who chooses not to play pro baseball<br/>
does so because they cannot.  Undoubtedly there are many who could, but<br/>
instead play pro football, basketball, soccer, etc.  There are far more<br/>
reasons as well.  It was amusing you chose this analogy to me.  I probably<br/>
could have played pro baseball, in high school I could already throw an 85<br/>
mph fastball.  In my senior year I quit playing though because I found<br/>
baseball boring.  Too much standing around, and not enough brain usage.<br/>
True I probably could have made millions, if I didn&#39;t blow my arm out<br/>
trying, if the pressure didn&#39;t overwhelm me, if...  You get the picture.<br/>
The number of baseball players, or football players, or musicians, or<br/>
actors, who make millions a year is roughly the same proportion to those who<br/>
try as the number of lottery winners is to those who play.  Sometimes it is<br/>
arrogant to assume something, even if it is proven later to be truth.</div>
