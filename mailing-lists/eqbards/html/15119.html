<b>Subject:</b> Selo&#39;s <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-435709153">Perceptually Selo&#39;s is about 30% slower for me (level 50, Selo&#39;s drum) since the<br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
Another 50th level bard with whom I spoke agreed and said he sent feedback.  I sent<br/>
feedback and petitioned.  The GM who answered submitted a bug report.  I also<br/>
contacted Shada and a few others to ask them if they noticed and to submit something<br/>
if they had.<br/>
<br/>
I unfortunately have no hard baseline against which to compare.  Would someone who<br/>
does please repeat a test?<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note and to address someone who asked about the minotaur hero: I<br/>
completed the quest last night.  When I arrived in Steamfont a druid gentleman was<br/>
waiting for the hero and said he had been there 4 hours and missed the one spawn<br/>
when he left briefly.  He soon logged and I was very fortunate because the hero<br/>
spwaned when I had been there less than an hour.  So that is two heroes in about 5<br/>
hours.  I know people were camping Meldrath and I was killing minos in the maze for<br/>
something to do and with slight hope it would help.  Perhaps I was just very very<br/>
lucky; perhaps killing the minos did help.  Either way I am very pleased =).<br/>
<br/>
Oh one other thing: GrimFeather drops lambent stones, did you know?<br/>
