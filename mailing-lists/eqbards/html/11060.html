<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012733">I dueled last nite.  I could start Selo&#39;s while rooted but it did nothing.<br/>
No pulse, no message, no ungreying of song buttons.  Zip, zilch, nada.  Only<br/>
while already playing it when rooted did it break it on a pulse.  A<br/>
reasonable compromise in my opinion, but they will probably say it is a bug<br/>
and nerf it again.<br/>

Actually, I was dueling a wizard friend of mine--he<br/>
was 30 and I was 26 level.  I broke root with selo&#39;s<br/>
everytime on a pulse.  I even wouldn&#39;t run it<br/>
constantly and I could start it up and break the root<br/>
on the first pulse.  Haven&#39;t checked on mobs. <br/>
Usually, the ones that root me lately can kill me in 3<br/>
casts anyway, so I don&#39;t really have a good way to<br/>
test.<br/>
