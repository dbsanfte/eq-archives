<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129493703">First, thanks to the list for giving me the confidence and information to try to complete this quest.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been able to get almost all the coins needed for the tambourine. I can say that the hardest coin and the only one I haven&#39;t gotten is the Kaesora coin. On Bertoxxulous there seems to be usually nobody in this dungeon. I&#39;ve got a fairly small guild with maybe about 8 people who are above level 35 but we may get a Kaesora raid in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
The only other coin that gave me trouble was the coin that drops off of the Scroungers in The Overthere. From what I&#39;ve read in this list, though, each bard had a high level player to give them some assistance.<br/>
<br/>
But I was fortunate to encounter a person who plays a 51 bard who solo&#39;d the coin and felt that I should be able to solo it as well. He told me to get a SOW, and sing invis. Then find a scrounger, DOT it, turn on invisibility, pull the scrounger out of the canyon, then kite it.<br/>
<br/>
Well the first time was disasterous. The only scrounger I found as deep in one of their temples, and when I pulled him, he aggro&#39;d 2 others near him. I hot Harm Touched 3 times and must have left a smoking crater on their floor. :-P<br/>
<br/>
The second time was better. I found a scrounger sitting outside. :-) I waited until he was by himself, then hit him with Fulfil&#39;s Chant (nice long range DOT), turned on invis and ran. I got HT&#39;d by him but must have resisted it as it did very little damage to me. There was just one Skopikos in the way and unfortunately, he aggro&#39;d on me as I let the scrounger get too close to me and lost my invis when he hit me (darn lag). The new one promptly Harm Touched me and the race was on.<br/>
<br/>
I turned on accelerando, equipped my drum, then proceeded to charm the scrounger to beat up the lesser one. Once the 2nd one was dead I chain/feared the scrounger and got my coin. In retrospect, I&#39;d just kite him in the future as he was pretty resistant to fear and knocked me silly a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, on Bertox, *nobody* hunts these things, so I wouldn&#39;t expect to be able to buy the coin from anyone nor get much assistance.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m a 35 bard wearing full lambent w/singing steel boots (completed totemic helm quest and traded for boots) and I&#39;m just using a Dragoon Dirk and Staff of Writhing (as I traded away some of my other weaps). I&#39;m planning to upgrade my weaps, but these do fine for now.<br/>
