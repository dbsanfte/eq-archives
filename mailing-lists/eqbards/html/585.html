computer program rather than just living the virtual lives of our<br/>
characters in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that the limitations, bugs, bad assumptions, inconsistencies<br/>
and such of the computer, the software, the programmers, and the game<br/>
designers cause us trouble in trying to play and trying to maintain the<br/>
right suspension of disbelief and roleplaying attitude, but we shouldn&#39;t<br/>
let that pull us into playing the computer rather than living the virtual<br/>
fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
I also understand that for some the game is understanding the software and<br/>
beating the programmers, but those are the people who I tend to avoid in<br/>
game.  They damage my fantasy.  I *know* I can understand software, but can<br/>
I be an effective, respected bard?  The first I do in real life.  The<br/>
second is what draws me to EverQuest.<br/>
<br/>
Our abilities in the real world don&#39;t work by formulas and isolated<br/>
numbers.  I suggest that overall we&#39;d have more fantasy-life fun if we<br/>
treated the virtual world similarly, even when we know deep down it&#39;s all<br/>
ones and zeros.<br/>
