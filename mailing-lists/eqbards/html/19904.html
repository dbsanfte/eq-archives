<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165868636">Gordon&#39;s answer is based on &quot;We never meant this to be a one-stop shopping&quot;<br/>
IMHO, people scream enough, they are more likely to remove ALL the trainers<br/>
and bankers than to put in a few.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, if they do that, I think they also will find the population in<br/>
Kunark leave. Its not fun to do that boat ride all the time. I have<br/>
basically<br/>
moved to Kunark, going back to the mainland only to buy spells.<br/>

&gt;There aren&#39;t any trainers because we didn&#39;t get any skills after 50 (till<br/>
&gt;53).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even so, now that Kunark is live, other classes have training facilities on<br/>
&gt;the new continent.  So maybe RoK Beta was tested by higher level PCs who<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t need training, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that players are now<br/>
&gt;flocking there from all level ranges, and as such, want to visit a trainer<br/>
&gt;when they level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What about those Bards that have saved up practice points and just want to<br/>
&gt;increase a skill or learn the basics of a new language?  Unlike<br/>
&gt;the majority<br/>
&gt;of other classes (I think there&#39;s one other class that doesn&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt;trainer, correct me if I&#39;m wrong), we have to travel to Kelethin<br/>
&gt;or Freeport<br/>
&gt;for the privilege.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Gordon&#39;s answer of (paraphrased) &quot;We don&#39;t want people to become totally<br/>
&gt;self-sufficient on the new continent&quot; screams of being a cop-out.  Other<br/>
&gt;classes are, why can&#39;t we?<br/>
