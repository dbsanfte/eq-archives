&gt;I saw The Priestezza underneath Kelethin and I was wondering who she is. I <br/>
&gt;was playing a high elf cleric at the time. There was a gnome there that <br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t see her. I tried to hail her and giving her copper but nothing <br/>
&gt;happened. Please tell me if you have any info.<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>

quests lately to help people who went PvP accidentally.<br/>
