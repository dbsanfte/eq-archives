<div id="ygrps-yiv-103292040"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Oh I know we can take Phin to the cleaners, the trick is he <br/>
&gt; has to be up first! I checked KK several times over the <br/>
&gt; weekend, between RL fun and game plans, and he was not up. <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s getting taken down pretty quickly apparently on our <br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oops... Sorry there. DC camped Phin pretty heavily this weekend (I <br/>
think we killed him 3 or 4 times.)<br/>
<br/>
Xzar did complete hit epic, though. <br/>
