killed a few and have Cinda&#39;s, OR have invis.<br/>
<br/>
Gauntlets drop at both the live side and dead side zone and are no drop<br/>
(grieves only at the Dead side). I think it is easier to get them at the<br/>
live side, just dance right in (bring muffins, milk and bandages in case the<br/>
group you are going to be a parasite upon needs em) and ask nicely if you<br/>
might loot the gauntlets if they don&#39;t need or can&#39;t use them. On both<br/>
servers I got them within minutes of arriving.<br/>
