Hi Kenross!<br/>
<br/>
Hello Martyn. Hello Harm.<br/>
<br/>
Having never actually &quot;earned&quot; a piece of armor since level 11 (given a full<br/>
set of bronze from a lev 48 I met one night in Rivervale and given a full<br/>
set of steel plate at level 24 by a member of my regular group who got sick<br/>
of seeing me in bronze - yes she is that rich) I was real happy to see the<br/>
Lambent quests.  I now have a full set of Lambent minus the helm - which I<br/>
will prolly get as soon as I can figger out how to deal with DW Gobs.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my Lambent was gotten with lots of help from other friends.  And I<br/>
have been glad to help them do their quests.  I been in lots of Grimfeather<br/>
hunting parties and for that risk get nothing but the xp and the satifaction<br/>
of helping my ranger freinds get their stuff.  Its fun to do thses things -<br/>
especially if you have a good group.<br/>
<br/>
My Lambent gloves were a gift from another player who&#39;s secondary&#39;s I guess<br/>
I helped along the way.  I traded my steel greaves for Lambent ones to a<br/>
guild mate who then gave the steel ones to another guild mate. And my worst<br/>
enemy&#39;s primary (or really i guess it&#39;s her seconadary now ;p) gave me a<br/>
Lambent BP just last night - just because.<br/>
<br/>
So, Kenross - I&#39;ll be gald to help you get some Lambent - gimme a tell when<br/>
you are on!<br/>
<br/>
But the point I wanted to make is Bards really need partys.  To get their<br/>
quest stuff and to go to the exciting places (Nagafen&#39;s Lair, Old Guk, the<br/>
Planes.)  First, these places require groups.  Next, to be survive-able,<br/>
good groups.  Third the really hard places require multiple groups.  The<br/>
people (who are competent) that plan Dragon raids or Plane raids - take<br/>
their guilds   pretty much exclusively.  There are reasons for this - they<br/>
know how to work together & they have people that they can trust (for<br/>
cooperation, skill, CR & loot sharing.)<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me, that to be a real success in this game, and get to go to<br/>
those places, you need to learn how to group along the way.  This means much<br/>
more that the mechanics of which songs and stuff. It means making some<br/>
friends and meeting the people along the way.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;    My comment stands.  However, I apologize for the seemingly lack of<br/>
&gt;   respect, but you&#39;ve got to realize I&#39;ve played this game<br/>
&gt;   as a bard longer than you have -- and I hear all the L20 bards<br/>
&gt;   complaining because the Lambent quests are too hard.  The fact<br/>
&gt;   that they think they should get Lambent because they are something<br/>
&gt;   special, irritates me.  I worked really hard for my armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic, Mister Know it All, Bard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Despite the sniping, you&#39;re both expressing frustration over the same thing:<br/>
you are both seeing<br/>
players wearing Lambent armor at levels below those intended by the game<br/>
design, and neither of<br/>
you like it.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of sounding like my (&quot;when I was a boy&quot;) father:<br/>
<br/>
When I was around level 20, tiring of wearing patchwork leather,<br/>
found-ringmail and a few pieces<br/>
of ultra-expensive banded (the four Master Smiths on my server had a<br/>
price-fixing cartel), I<br/>
calculated that a full set of Banded Armor would cost me about as much as it<br/>
would to become a<br/>
Smith, so I made a set for myself.  That was my first sweeping armor upgrade<br/>
since cloth at level<br/>
4 and patchwork at level 8.  (I&#39;m a tailor, too.)  I am now level 33, and I<br/>
do not own a single<br/>
piece of Lambent.  I intend to start questing for some next weekend.<br/>
<br/>
If you are not a twinked character, and you are level 22, you cannot expect<br/>
to have Lambent Armor<br/>
unless you have at least a few high-level friends.  This is irritating,<br/>
sure.  (At level 33, I<br/>
get pretty irritated seeing players in their teens with better armor/weapons<br/>
than I have, and I<br/>
have some pretty good ones, due to some friends semi-twinking me while I was<br/>
in my 20s.)  But the<br/>
fact is that you are playing the game as designed.  If it makes you unhappy,<br/>
there are things you<br/>
can do about it (joining a Guild comes to mind).<br/>
If you can&#39;t, though, you should take some solace and some pride in the fact<br/>
that you are making<br/>
your way through this game the way it was intended, by earning things for<br/>
yourself at the level<br/>
at which they are appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
It is not that you &quot;don&#39;t deserve it&quot;; it&#39;s that the other players you&#39;re<br/>
looking at haven&#39;t<br/>
earned it.<br/>
