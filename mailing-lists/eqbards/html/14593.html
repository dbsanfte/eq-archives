<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763143075"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; at it)  By the time we get there, there will be no chance.  We will not<br/>
&gt; be lvl 50 before expansion, I cant imagine what Verant is going to do to<br/>
&gt; all those guys then...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  No, no... I&#39;m saying you cannot squeeze that many more people into<br/>
  one fight.  They are making it so you need more and more people to<br/>
  do certain things.  And it will come to a point where you bring so<br/>
  many people who are needed to do a dragon, that they all will go<br/>
  linkdead.  Verant cannot keep upping the dragons like this, next<br/>
  thing you know the dragons will be shouting out people&#39;s names.<br/>
<br/>
  If you bring 24 elite L50s to a dragon fight in full planar armor<br/>
  and resist gear, you had damn well better win.  Verant completely<br/>
  plays down the fact that L50s are the highest and most experienced<br/>
  players in the world.  I should be like Bard from the Hobbit.  <br/>
  Oops, I don&#39;t get Archery... nm.  heh.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; leveling people.  To be honest all the high levels being bored is<br/>
&gt; speeding my level progress right now, as they are often around to help<br/>
&gt; me when I do something stupid (like die deep in Befallen) and they (at<br/>
&gt; least for me) are often genrorous with equipment...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It seems that&#39;s all I&#39;ve been really doing lately in my spare time.<br/>
  Helping out people.  Handing out bronze and money.  Doing quests <br/>
  for people who are less fortunate.  Can&#39;t really buff people, but<br/>
  I can hang around and make sure the little peeps are doing ok.<br/>
  I&#39;ll camp permafrost and grab some coronets and pass them out to<br/>
  monks, or some axes/blades to younger bards who show great prospect.<br/>
<br/>
  I have the items to make Lambent Gauntlets, anyone here need them<br/>
  on Innoruuk?<br/>
