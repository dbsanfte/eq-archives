<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-936342198">I didn&#39;t consider the STR factor.  I am a wimpy bard in regards to STR, with<br/>
mine barely being over 100.  If I didn&#39;t have some weight reducing bags, I<br/>
could never loot FS weapons to sell for cash without exceeding my weight<br/>
capacity.  If I switched to the SS arms, not only would I lose the STR bonus<br/>
for the SotA, but the extra weight from the SS arms would make my situation<br/>
even worse.  So guess I will stick with SotA for now.<br/>

It really depends on your bard.  are you hurting for strength?  the 6ac by<br/>
itself<br/>
is really negligible and you won&#39;t notice the difference.  that dar knight<br/>
in sebilis<br/>
won&#39;t all of a sudden start hitting you for 90 instead of 110, for example,<br/>
heh.<br/>
but the singing steel will weigh more, so if you have a low base strength,<br/>
you may<br/>
not be able to go full singing steel.  i put all my spare points in the<br/>
beginning into<br/>
strength because i knew in the teens/20&#39;s i&#39;d need it for bronze armor.<br/>
lambent and<br/>
imbrued isn&#39;t too heavy, but then singing steel is pretty weighty again.  so<br/>
it worked<br/>
out pretty good.  i&#39;ve got full singing steel except for hero bracer and<br/>
ebbp and i run<br/>
into weight problems every now and then even with an abukar box.<br/>
<br/>
on the other hand, 2k is just plat, and easily replaceable.  just go farm<br/>
unrest<br/>
or cazic or lower guk for fine steel weapons.<br/>
