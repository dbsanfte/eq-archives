  Today&#39;s patch primarily contained preparations for Kunark, including some<br/>
new art. There was also a bug that was fixed with a bard song that was put<br/>
in last Tuesday. The song (a charm upgrade) was not capped. Someone was kind<br/>
enough to send us a screenshot of someone with a *really nice* pet named<br/>
Cazic-Thule.<br/>
