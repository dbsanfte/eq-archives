<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691668333">That&#39;s what I thought too, but apparently the teleport spot for Butcherblock<br/>
is at about 10,000 ft.  You immediately fall and take 10,000 points anyhow<br/>
which is as you can guess instantly fatal.  Not good when you are bound in<br/>
Halas at the time as I was.  The GM&#39;s never responded to my petition even<br/>
though I was beneath the world and was supposedly teleported to a &quot;safe<br/>
spot&quot;<br/>

Early on, I was told this is what happens when you would have died while you<br/>
are in zone.Instead of dying, you are teleported at full lif. i&#39;d rather be<br/>
teleported than die myself :)<br/>

&gt;I have yet to experience that particular zoning bug, but I have often<br/>
&gt;fallen victim to the zoning bug in Ogguk--often when someone zones at one<br/>
&gt;bubb or less of life, they get teleported to a random location near the<br/>
&gt;center of the zone, but not always the same location.  Myself, I do not<br/>
&gt;want to *count* the times that has happened to me, but it has always been<br/>
&gt;at a bubble or less.  Anyone know how common this is, or am I just a<br/>
&gt;lucky one?<br/>
