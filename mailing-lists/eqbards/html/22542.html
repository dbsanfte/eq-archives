<div id="ygrps-yiv-382882785">Creediki[FoH] just got his Singing Short Sword a few days before the patch <br/>
went in. It&#39;s pretty damn sweet, and moreso now that it acts as a universal <br/>
instrument. He tested it on different songs and found that it is <br/>
substantially less powerful as an instrument than selo&#39;d drums or kelin&#39;s <br/>
lute, but it still amplifies pretty well. I&#39;m sure someone will post some <br/>
stats on how it stacks up verses our normal instruments.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently 1 white scale away from getting my SSS. We&#39;ve been killing Vox <br/>
weekly, but she has not been very generous with scales. If you want to see a <br/>
CRAP loot load, you should have been present yesterday when ALL she dropped <br/>
was 4 frozen paladin books. Today she dropped 2 RBB&#39;s, a bracer, and a <br/>
crystal spear so she kinda made up for that faux pax, but STILL NO <br/>
SCALES...grr...<br/>
<br/>
Oh well. If Shada or anyone else with an SSS posts some instrument-tests I&#39;m <br/>
sure we&#39;d all be curious to see how it does. =P<br/>
