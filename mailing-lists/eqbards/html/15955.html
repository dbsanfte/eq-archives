&gt; Who cares about the proc?  Most weapons don&#39;t average<br/>
&gt; more than 1 proc every 45 seconds or so anyway<br/>
&gt; (contrary to most people&#39;s belief that they average 4<br/>
&gt; or 5 procs per fight).  The damage/delay is better<br/>
&gt; than the ykesha and ebw (not taking into account magic<br/>
&gt; numbers and lower delay,etc).  I guess I still don&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to go test my six-note blade (11/25) against the<br/>
Allizewsaur later this month.  But from my gut feeling looking<br/>
at the damage I&#39;m scoring in typical play, I&#39;d say that the<br/>
Ykesha + proc is better than a six-note blade.  Assuming the<br/>
proc is mostly unresisted, which is usually the case against<br/>
blues.  The Ykesha&#39;s proc with about 50% resist rate against<br/>
the Allizewsaur increased its damage/time figure by 15%, even<br/>
though the proc only went off about once every 45 seconds.<br/>
