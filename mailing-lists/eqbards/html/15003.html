<div id="ygrps-yiv-291552817">Some of them turn green at 46.  These are the ones in the cave in Feerott.<br/>
This seems to be a good spot to pull from if the spawn is well spread out.<br/>
Last night, I was pulling for my group and a level 47 SK was pulling to solo<br/>
and we had a pretty good pace going.  I had 2 rogues and wiz, mage, pally in<br/>
my group.  The specs died fast and we had a nice pace even with the other<br/>
guy pulling for himself.<br/>
<br/>
I was using lament to reduce their agro in hopes of pulling singles.  Also I<br/>
would lament, agro, then run but not out of line of site.  Again, this was<br/>
to try to prevent them from teleporting thru the agro ranges of the others.<br/>
They seem to path well if they have line of site to you. If not, they will<br/>
teleport and bring friends.<br/>
<br/>
Do we know for sure that a horn will enhance our screetch song?<br/>
<br/>
It looks like 46 is a break point for resists on spectres for Denons<br/>
Dischord.  At 45, I tried it and got more resists than I liked so I went to<br/>
other songs.  At 46, I tried it again thinking 2 brass songs Denons and<br/>
Screetch (yes I am lazy and dont like to swap instruments) would be good<br/>
idea.  Lots better success - very few resists compared to 45 and no brass<br/>
skill increases (I was maxxed already) so it must have been a level<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the last pull was 4 or 5 spectres and it was just me and 1 rogue.<br/>
Too many resists and I yelled &quot;ZONE!&quot;  &quot;Right on your arse!&quot; was the<br/>
response and we Selos zoned into Rathe with less than a bub of hp for me.<br/>
