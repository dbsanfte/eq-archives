number of people in your group will make a big difference in<br/>
the group&#39;s ability.  The biggest jump is going from 1 person<br/>
to 2 people (double the hp, double the damage output = killing<br/>
stuff twice as fast with half the downtime).  So when your<br/>
bard leaves, the drop in your group&#39;s effectiveness is not<br/>
just due to lack of a bard, it&#39;s also due to lack of a 4th<br/>
group member.<br/>
<br/>
You need to replace the bard with someone else (hopefully as<br/>
competent a player :) and compare.<br/>

&gt; Thats a pretty good sign of a good wizard), but I don;t think the group<br/>
&gt; really hurts without her.  Obviously fights go slower, but I would say<br/>
&gt; our xp gain is about the same with or without her.  Theres a definite<br/>

damage mobs do is really not that great relative to your hp.  <br/>
You end up killing stuff and having little downtime.  Having a<br/>
nuker there to shorten your fights does not really affect<br/>
things much because your group is already operating at near<br/>
top effectiveness.  i.e. The ratio of mob survival time to<br/>
your survival time is already very low.  If the wizard<br/>
accounts for half the group&#39;s damage, nuking to cut it in half<br/>
from 0.1 to 0.05 does not make that big a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Later on, the mobs do a lot more damage so you end up killing<br/>
stuff and having lots of downtime.  The ratio of mob survival<br/>
time to your survival time is rather high, say 0.8.  Nuking to<br/>
cut it in half from 0.8 to 0.4 makes a big difference.<br/>
