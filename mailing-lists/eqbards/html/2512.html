<div id="ygrps-yiv-677495617">I&#39;m not sure anyone knows where proc comes from other than that Verant has<br/>
used it to describe weapons and items that cast spells.  My guess would be<br/>
that it refers to Pro C, that when a weapon casts a spell it triggers a Pro<br/>
C routine to do that, hence proc.  Just a guess, could be way off base.<br/>
<br/>
Or it could refer to the master enchanter Proc&#39;Daron of S. Ro who is said to<br/>
have ivented the embedding spell that allows inanimate objects to cast<br/>
spells randomly, hence Proc.  I hear the dervishes of that area actually<br/>
prefer the term Daron.<br/>

software and its design, like &quot;mob&quot; have a way of slipping into the game.<br/>
Bet you haven&#39;t guessed that bothers me.  :-)}<br/>
<br/>
At least I have a good reason here.  Programmers jargon is handy for<br/>
programmers but it leads to less understanding for those who are not.<br/>
Verant has a bad habit of using such jargon, even in system warnings, with<br/>
no explanation whatsoever of what it means.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unreasonable and inconsiderate to invent words or give old words new<br/>
meaning then expect others to know what they mean.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the software industry for 30 years.  The<br/>
only real way to stem the tide of ugly jargon is to push back and refuse to<br/>
use it yourself, both of which I try to do.<br/>
