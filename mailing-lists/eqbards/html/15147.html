<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167667358"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My hubby has changed from playing a monk to playing a human shadowknight<br/>
&gt;(he secretly plans on revolting from his God - shhh).  Now that he can<br/>
&gt;make a pet, I need to worry about what songs are bad to play when his<br/>
&gt;pet is around.  Do songs like the Chords of Dissonance affect the pet?<br/>
&gt;Will the pet also run fast when I&#39;m playing Selo&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Since I last posted, I&#39;ve now acquired the 8th and 9th songs, and should<br/>
&gt;be getting the 10th tonight or tomorrow.  I&#39;m finding it hard to save up<br/>
&gt;the platinum for a combo sword (I&#39;ve finally put aside smithing for<br/>
&gt;awhile, but the tailoring habit is hard to break, with all those spider<br/>
&gt;silks I&#39;m looting.).  Sing a song of patience for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Suggestion: Turn the spider silks into silk swatches, then just hold onto<br/>
the<br/>
now stackable swatches. You can always use them later/sell them to someone<br/>
desperate NOW for such things or nice money :) And you don&#39;t lose any money.<br/>
Silk swatches are worth slightly more than 2 spider silks.</div>
