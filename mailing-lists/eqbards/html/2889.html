<br/>
     Level 1: Chant of Battle<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: +DEX & +STR<br/>
<br/>
     someone has claimed +19 STR and DEX, and +5 AC at<br/>
     30th level while playing with a drum. In the same message,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting +19 str and dex at L24 with a drum, +4 AC.  Without the<br/>
drum it&#39;s +11 str and dex, +2 AC.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 2: Chords of Dissonance<br/>
     Effects: NON-PARTY: Damage to all non PC&#39;s in 30&#39; radius<br/>
<br/>
     song. As you level, this song will grow stronger. Someone<br/>
     reported doing 16 damage per pulse with an instrument at<br/>
     level 30. As with all other Bard DoT songs, it has a duration<br/>
     of 4 ticks (a tick is 2.5 seconds) after you stop playing it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I agree with this, although I know that&#39;s what<br/>
J.M. said.  When I play the song, I can see the target&#39;s<br/>
health bars drop in 6 second ticks just like all our other<br/>
songs, and their health drops three times (once with the<br/>
wince message, twice without).  I suppose it&#39;s possible that<br/>
my client is being updated in 6 second increments, although<br/>
I&#39;m on a cable modem so bandwidth is not an issue...<br/>
<br/>
     Level 3: Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: Stamina Return + Mana Regen<br/>
<br/>
If you drop below 33% stamina, you will start to lose dex,<br/>
agi, and str.  Watch your stamina and check your stats while<br/>
riding the boat to learn the deletrious effects of not having<br/>
a bard in the party to sing the jig during an extended fight.<br/>
<br/>
Off topic, but I found out if you run laps while the boat is<br/>
moving, you will *gain* stamina!  Apparently when you are<br/>
running fore to aft on the boat, it cancels the forward motion<br/>
of the boat, and the game considers you to be standing still<br/>
(or walking), and thus replenishes your stamina.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 5: Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: Increases Movement and Stamina<br/>
     level), you run faster than someone with the popular Spirit<br/>
     of the Wolf spell. As you get higher in level, you will<br/>
     gradually run faster. By the time you reach the mid 40&#39;s in<br/>
<br/>
Might want to include my timings.  To recap, running speed<br/>
(how much faster am I running?) and time to run between two<br/>
points (how much faster will I get to where I am going?) are:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;pre&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Effect  speed time<br/>
Normal  1.00  1.00  (baseline)<br/>
SoW     1.39  0.72  (L20 druid)<br/>
Selo&#39;s  1.38  0.73  (L21, no drum)<br/>
Selo&#39;s  1.64  0.61  (L21, with drum)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would assume the ratios for walking are identical, though I<br/>
need to time how walking compares to running.<br/>
<br/>
     game. If you get attacked, just keep running and ignore<br/>
     them. If you are under 50% HP or more, you will run<br/>
     slower, so if you have 1% hp left, do not expect to &#39;run like<br/>
<br/>
I believe this effect doesn&#39;t kick in until under 33% hp,<br/>
which is the same time the agi penalty kicks in.  Also, there<br/>
seems to be a minimum walking speed at which you will walk<br/>
with even 1 hp.  At about L20+, walking with Accelerando and a<br/>
drum is faster than most mobs can run.  I pulled a party<br/>
member in Unrest from inside the house all the way to the zone<br/>
while he only had 1/3rd of a bubble of health left.  He walked<br/>
the entire way and easily outdistanced the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
     of a possible 1 to 5. An undocumented feature of this song<br/>
     is that it will break &#39;root&#39; based spells. If you get rooted by a<br/>
     monster, just sing this song and even though the root<br/>
     icon will still be on your screen, you will now be able to<br/>
     move normally. This is supposedly NOT a bug, but a design<br/>
<br/>
You should mention it doesn&#39;t break root underground.<br/>
<br/>
Druids in wolf form naturally run at SoW, but cannot cast SoC<br/>
on themselves.  I&#39;m curious what happens if you&#39;re grouped<br/>
with a druid in wolf form and you play Accelerando.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 6: Hymn of Restoration<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: Healing<br/>
     faster and for more points per pulse. The rate of healing goes up<br/>
     about 2 points per pulse every 6 levels, hence level 12 heals at 8<br/>
     points/pulse, level 18 heals 10 points/pulse, level 24 heals 12<br/>
     points/pulse, level 30 heals 16 points/pulse, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I only get 11 points/pulse at 24 standing, 1 of which is my<br/>
natural regeneration rate.  So the song is only adding 10<br/>
points/pulse.  You do get 12 points/pulse overall if you are<br/>
sitting.  The regen rates are half if you are not using a<br/>
lute/mandolin (5 points/pulse + 1 point/pules natural regen =<br/>
6 points/pulse standing, 7 points/pulse sitting).<br/>
<br/>
     Level 7: Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong<br/>
     Effects: SELF: +STR, +AC, +Attack Speed<br/>
<br/>
+17 str, +4 AC at L24.<br/>
<br/>
     lieu of Hymm of Restoration or Chant of Battle. Also, while this<br/>
     song is stackable with Anthem de Arms, the attack speed increases<br/>
     will only partially stack. I believe the current thought is that<br/>
     with both stacked, attack speed will increase 25%.<br/>
<br/>
I think I may have an explanation for why people were getting<br/>
different timing results stacking this and anthem.  We all<br/>
know that movement speed modifiers (root, Accelerando, SoW) do<br/>
not stack.  It could be that attack accelerators also do not<br/>
stack.  That would mean your current combat speed boost is the<br/>
last one you were influenced by.  Depending on your weapon<br/>
speed and how you twisted the songs, you could get results<br/>
anywhere from as slow as Anthem to as fast as Warsong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to test this more carefully some time in the future.<br/>
Many of the enchanters I run across can cast Quickness, which<br/>
also speeds up your attack speed.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 9: Elemental Rhythms<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: + Protections - Fire, Cold, and Magic<br/>
<br/>
     Analysis: This is the first of the protection songs. On a 13th<br/>
     level Bard, resistances are +9 singing, or +19 with an<br/>
     instrument. While not very useful at lower levels, when you<br/>
     start to encounter spell casting monsters, this song will be<br/>
     greatly appreciated. At level 20, when using a drum, I can<br/>
     twist this song with Purifying or Guardian Rhythms and<br/>
     increase Magic Resistances for my party by over 50.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been able to twist it with Purifying Rhythms.  +17<br/>
to resists, +2 to AC without drum at L24.  +30 to resists, +4<br/>
to AC with a drum.  All in all I would say the Rhythm songs<br/>
are much more effective than the Endure Magic/Fire/Cold line<br/>
of spells casters get early on (+25 to resist) since the song<br/>
raises multiple resists and affects the entire party at once.  <br/>
The songs stack with the spells though, so if you want you can<br/>
stack them all to get some pretty outrageous resists.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 10: Anthem de Arms<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: +Attack Speed, +STR<br/>
<br/>
+17 to str, same as Warsong.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 11: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon<br/>
     Effects: SELF: Add NPC faction, up 1 /con level<br/>
<br/>
     indifferent or worse, this song will increase the /con level by<br/>
     1 in most cases. There are 2 uses for this song. First: you<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had it take merchants from apprehensive to amiable, which<br/>
is 2 /con levels.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 12: Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow<br/>
     Effects: SINGLE: 1-7 points damage<br/>
<br/>
The damage range should be corrected in lieu of the formula<br/>
(level/2 + 1).  This song is nice early on, but IMHO bards get<br/>
too dependent on it and keep using it well after it pretty<br/>
much becomes ineffective.  At my level, 13 damage every 5<br/>
seconds (15 seconds if you&#39;re twisting) is pretty much<br/>
negligible in a party where each member is hitting for an<br/>
average of 10-70 points every 2-4 seconds.  I&#39;ve been fooling<br/>
around with substituting Discord in place of it.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, we need to figure out exactly how long a<br/>
&quot;tick&quot; or &quot;pulse&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
     is the monster magnet of all time. It has been known to<br/>
     draw monsters from totally separate rooms, through locked<br/>
     doors. Be very careful with this song in delicate dungeon<br/>
     settings. The formula to calculate damage for this song is (<br/>
     level / 2 ) + 1.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is a problem with the song, but rather just<br/>
the way the monster AI works in general.  If a mob decides to<br/>
attack you, it &quot;tells&quot; any social mobs nearby and they will<br/>
attack you too.  Some dungeons are well designed so the walls<br/>
are thick enough to prevent this crosstalk.  Others are not so<br/>
well designed and activating one mob will bring others which<br/>
are out of sight behind walls and doors.  Bellow is usually a<br/>
bard&#39;s first ranged attack (since few seem to use throwing<br/>
knives), and so is the first time they really notice this.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 13: Purifying Rhythms<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: +Protection: Poison, Disease, and Magic<br/>
     Skill: Percussion Instruments<br/>
<br/>
     provided. The level of protection is either +9 or +19,<br/>
     depending on whether or not an instrument is used. In<br/>
<br/>
I get +17/+30 to resist and +2/+4 to AC at L24.  This is the<br/>
same as with Elemental Rhythms.  The song stacks with Guardian<br/>
Rhythms, but not Elemental.<br/>
<br/>
     particular, it appears that this song is tailored to combat the<br/>
     specific resistances needed to battle undead creatures. This<br/>
     song is a must for combat with, mummies, zombies, and evil<br/>
     mages. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I agree.  All the diseases I&#39;ve thus far run<br/>
across are very slow acting, and rabies does nothing except<br/>
stop your natural hp regeneration (which is almost meaningless<br/>
with a bard around).  Some of the poisons can be nasty if left<br/>
uncured, but they are also slow acting DoTs which we usually<br/>
cure after a fight.  I would rather twist Elemental rhythms to<br/>
better resist the magical fire and ice attacks which can do<br/>
several hundred points damage at once, than Purifying to save<br/>
my party from disease/poison effects which are so slow I can<br/>
pretty much nullify them by playing Restoration.<br/>
<br/>
     There was some discussion on the Bard mailing lists<br/>
     that this song is Stringed Instruments, but that appears to<br/>
     have been a bug. It twists well with Elemental Rhythms<br/>
     since it is also percussion based.<br/>
<br/>
Correct, appears to have been fixed now so that it uses a<br/>
drum.  And as I mentioned above, it does not twist with<br/>
Elemental Rhythms.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 15: Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby<br/>
     Effects: NON-PARTY: Enthrall & Nix S. List<br/>
<br/>
     this song next to a guard, or he will start attacking you. Each<br/>
     monster affected has two chances to break out of the<br/>
     Lullaby every pulse. The first is a standard resist, which<br/>
     nullifies the song outright, and the second is the chance<br/>
     (which varies based on Bard CHA, instrument used, level<br/>
     spread, etc) to just plain ignore the song. Also, Kelin&#39;s Lucid<br/>
<br/>
You should mention that hitting the mob wakes it up (attacking<br/>
it does not, as I&#39;ve watched with amusement out of mana<br/>
casters trying to melee to finish off mobs I&#39;ve put to sleep<br/>
for them :-).  So it&#39;s important that your party concentrate<br/>
on just one target while you put the rest to sleep.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
trying to experiment to see if the Dissonance/Discord line of<br/>
songs also wakes them up (I&#39;m pretty sure the &quot;wince&quot; does,<br/>
but don&#39;t know about the two message-less pulses that come<br/>
afterwards).<br/>
<br/>
     Lullaby now has a maximum of four targets. You won&#39;t be<br/>
<br/>
I have used it to simultaneously sleep many more than 4<br/>
targets.  Just this weekend I used it on 7 gnolls in<br/>
Blackburrow (scrolled back and counted 7 simultaneous &quot;nods&quot;<br/>
messages).<br/>
<br/>
     volume of fire to the party, and the nod effect is great for<br/>
     making casters flub a spell. Also, the nod effect will interfere<br/>
<br/>
Makes it *very* valuable when fighting multiple spellcasters,<br/>
especially if your party is following the everyone-attack-the-<br/>
same-target rule.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 17: Guardian Rythms<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: +AC & +Magic Resistance<br/>
<br/>
     Analysis: Contrary to rumors floating around, an instrument<br/>
     is not required to play this song. It gives +13 magic<br/>
     resistance and +4 AC when singing. You get a lot more<br/>
<br/>
Despite being touted as a magic-resist-only song, it does not<br/>
raise your magic resist any more than Elemental or Purifying<br/>
rhythms. It does raise AC more than the other rhythm songs<br/>
(twice as much), but even at L24 with a drum, the difference<br/>
is nothing to get excited about.  +17 to MR, +4 AC without a<br/>
drum.  +30 to MR, +8 to AC with a drum.<br/>
<br/>
     when played with an instrument. Using a drum, twisting this<br/>
     song with the level 13 Purifying Rhythms, you can easily<br/>
     beef up a party&#39;s magic resistance 50+ points. This is good<br/>
     for fighting Evil Eyes and other spell casting monsters.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s main advantage is that it stacks with Elemental or<br/>
Purifying rhythms, which is basically the only time I use it.  <br/>
Otherwise I use Elemental - I only lose a couple AC and gain<br/>
two more resists.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 18: Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord<br/>
     Effects: NON-PARTY: Damage & -AC<br/>
<br/>
     or he will start attacking you. When you first get this song,<br/>
     and play it with an instrument, expect to 19 points damage<br/>
     and drop AC by 19 (with a 50 brass skill). When fighting<br/>
     multiple monsters, you will actually do more damage with<br/>
     this song than using your melee weapon. The hard part is<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s an important point most bards are overlooking.<br/>
This song is awesome.  I played around with twisting it,<br/>
Dissonance, and either Chain or Restoration, and the fights<br/>
went about as easily as when I&#39;m using weapons.<br/>
<br/>
The graphical effects will kill your framerate though once you<br/>
reach L24 and get the extra lights.  I&#39;ve started turning my<br/>
particle density (under display options) off when I&#39;m using<br/>
this or Dissonance, and tell the rest of my party to do the<br/>
same.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 19: Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: Invisibility<br/>
<br/>
     were not there. This is a pulse based song. Every pulse, a<br/>
     skill check is made. If you fail a skill check, you become<br/>
     visible until the next tick (about 2.5 seconds). This is both a<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s how it works.  I&#39;ve become visible and<br/>
had to wait a full tick before being shrouded again.  And I&#39;ve<br/>
become visible and almost instantly been shrouded again.  The<br/>
invisibility spells have a &quot;random&quot; duration because there&#39;s a<br/>
chance they can just blink off without warning before their<br/>
full duration is up.  I think the song works the same way, and<br/>
we just have the fringe benefit of becoming invisible again<br/>
the next tick instead of having to recast invisibility.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 20: Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>
     Effects: NON-PARTY: -Attack SPD & AC<br/>
<br/>
     Analysis: Song effects are obvious, reducing attack speed<br/>
     and AC of monsters and NPCs. This song is one of the<br/>
     more dangerous a bard can sing. Monsters hate this song,<br/>
     but not as much as the level 18 Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord.<br/>
     The attack speed of the monster will visibly slow down<br/>
     under the effects of this song. In most cases, however, the<br/>
<br/>
I timed this on a fire beetle and got a 23% slowdown in their<br/>
attack speed at L24.  I tried it on an orc warrior and got the<br/>
exact same results (funny how both an orc warrior and fire<br/>
beetle attack once every 3.0 seconds...).<br/>
<br/>
     Level 21: Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: Short distance random teleport<br/>
<br/>
     distance. Apparently does not teleport you through walls or<br/>
     locked doors. In a dungeon, this song can get you in a whole<br/>
     lot of trouble. <br/>
<br/>
Since it doesn&#39;t teleport you through walls or locked doors,<br/>
I&#39;d have to question just how much trouble it can get you in.<br/>
<br/>
     Outdoors, however, with a flute in hand, it<br/>
     has an amazing range. From the front gate of Qeynos, one<br/>
     pulse can jump you to the zone line. Lots of fun, you do a<br/>
<br/>
The song seems to transport you to &quot;ground level.&quot;  If there<br/>
is a lake or ocean nearby, &quot;ground level&quot; means the bottom.  <br/>
Be prepared to swim up quickly to avoid drowning if you use<br/>
this song near any water.  Especially if it&#39;s night and the<br/>
water is murky enough that you&#39;re effectively blind.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 22: Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody<br/>
     Effects: PARTY: Cancel Magic<br/>
<br/>
     Unconfirmed Analysis: This song now works, and turns out<br/>
     to be better than the Cancel Magic spell that spell casters<br/>
     get. This song supposedly will get rid of all DoT and<br/>
     de-buffs that have been cast upon a party, but will leave all<br/>
     of your buffs intact. Very useful, and what Cancel Magic<br/>
     should have been. Note: this song will not cure disease or<br/>
     get rid of charm.<br/>
<br/>
I had a chance to try it on another DoT.  It did *nothing*.<br/>
Does anyone have *any* idea what this song does?  From the<br/>
name I&#39;m starting to think that maybe it only nullifies charm.  <br/>
The question also remains whether you play the song to remove<br/>
the effect, or if you play it continuously to avoid being hit<br/>
by the effect in the first place.  The fact that it puts an<br/>
icon on your screen for 3 pulses seems to suggest the latter.<br/>
<br/>
     Level 23: Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain<br/>
     Effects: TARGET: Slow Down Target Movement & Attack Speed<br/>
<br/>
     Unconfirmed Analysis: Apparently, one of the more useful<br/>
     songs in a Bards arsenal, as it will make monsters move<br/>
     slower, so you can run around them, casting direct damage<br/>
     songs without being hit. Also, if a monster is trying to run<br/>
     away, this song will supposedly root them. It is similar to<br/>
     spell snare.<br/>
<br/>
What happens is that snare slows down movement speed.  If your<br/>
natural movement speed is below a certain threshold (i.e.  <br/>
trying to walk away while wounded), it gets dropped to zero.  <br/>
It turns out to actually be *better* than root.  With root,<br/>
the mob knows it can&#39;t run, so it turns around to fight until<br/>
it dies.  With snare/chain, the mob keeps trying to run even<br/>
though it can&#39;t move, so you get to kill it without it<br/>
attacking you.<br/>
<br/>
     Unlike other spell casters, a Bard can sing this<br/>
     song while running after a mob that is trying to get away,<br/>
     making it very useful in places like Guk and Befallen, where<br/>
     mobs run away, only to come back later with a quite a few<br/>
     of their friends for some payback. This is a great addition to<br/>
     a Bard&#39;s arsenal.<br/>
<br/>
The song also has a *huge* range (although it may have been<br/>
decreased judging from the couple hours I played last night).  <br/>
I&#39;ve started using this as my fetching song instead of bellow.  <br/>
It&#39;s a little annoying that the mob walks towards me instead<br/>
of runs, but I still seem to come out ahead in the time and<br/>
risk department.  Use the time the mob is walking to tell your<br/>
group &quot;incoming.&quot;  It&#39;s also a huge taunt which makes it<br/>
harder for someone to steal your pull.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also use it as my help-others-without-stealing-their-kill<br/>
song.  It slows down attack speed the same as Binding, and<br/>
stops mobs from running.  Just be careful you don&#39;t use it so<br/>
much that the mob decides to attack you instead of them,<br/>
unless that is your intent.  After all those stupid orc<br/>
oracles casting drowsy and walking sleep on me, it&#39;s nice to<br/>
make the monsters attack slower for a change.<br/>
