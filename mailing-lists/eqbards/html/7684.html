<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-918168520">Having downloaded (and then actually read) the roughly 200 messages<br/>
regarding Binding, I feel that I have a right to state my position once:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Bind Affinity is a very useful utility spell as originally designed<br/>
(bind only in cities).<br/>
<br/>
2.  Permitting Bind elsewhere is a pretty big bonus to spellcasters up<br/>
to the point that they can resurrect; beyond that point, it is really to<br/>
everyone&#39;s advantage that they come back close to the action, or we<br/>
would have to wait for THEM to make the long run before being<br/>
resurrected.  Boy, would THAT be tedious!<br/>
<br/>
3.  The really destabilizing part of this is not Bind Affinity in and of<br/>
itself, but is Bind combined with Gate.  This combination permits<br/>
spellcasters to escape combat far more readily than any melee type<br/>
(Bards included).  This has two consequences, creating a double-whammy:<br/>
1) they can return to fighting earlier than the melee types who are<br/>
still hoofing it back, which allows them to GAIN more experience that<br/>
melee classes GAIN (yes, spellcasters can&#39;t always do this, but can do<br/>
this a significant part of the time); and 2) the Bind/Gate combination<br/>
as currently set up allows them to LOSE significantly less experience<br/>
than we (and other melee classes) LOSE.  The latter part has not been<br/>
addressed here, but I think it&#39;s a very big part of the reason that<br/>
people are so irritated by the current Bind rules.<br/>
<br/>
My original thought was that Bind should only be allowed in cities, but<br/>
(aside from the tormented screams from current caster classes) I think<br/>
it would make the game much more tedious for everyone, not just the<br/>
casters.  I now think that it should be possible to Bind all classes in<br/>
all (Bindable) zones, that not all zones should be Bindable, and that<br/>
Bind should require acceptance by the target, as does resurrection.<br/>
<br/>
As for Bards, I think it would be both nice and appropriate to have a<br/>
mid-teens, low-twenties song that permitted Bards to Bind themselves.<br/>
Nobody else, no group binds, no components, no health loss, just a<br/>
simple self-only Bind.  We are travelers, having this ability fits<br/>
perfectly with the concept of the class, and frankly, I don&#39;t see why we<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be able to have this ability.  Don&#39;t tell me &quot;because Verant<br/>
won&#39;t do it&quot;.  I don&#39;t care, and that&#39;s not an argument.<br/>
