<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040617656"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What is the Sol A Safe Room?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A.K.A. The Fur Room, A.K.A. The Austin Powers Room, both for the lovely furs<br/>
that cover the floors. The zone to Sol B is right there for bailing. While<br/>
Sol B doesn&#39;t sound like a *safe* place to zone to, in all the time I spent<br/>
in the Austin Powers room I never ONCE zoned into trouble in SolB.<br/>
I love that room, you can pull however much you want (er, and more! :o) and<br/>
it is the perfect AE song space. I did most of the pulling, I had macros set<br/>
up for &quot;Small Pull&quot; &quot;Big Pull&quot; and &quot;Zone&quot; then I would settle in to play AE<br/>
songs. The Warrior had her hands full taunting off me and the cleric spent a<br/>
good chunk of mana on me, but we could really handle a LOT of pull. The big<br/>
issue is runners, you need a runner team (gotta love rogues for that).<br/>
And while I am on the subject of backstabbing...at ALL times in Sol A keep<br/>
your back to the wall. This is not simply a good idea, you have to practice<br/>
it absolutly every moment you are in battle. Those Fire Gobbies backstab<br/>
often and HARD. When someone called &quot;ZONE&quot; I would sing lull, wait till they<br/>
made the hallway and only then follow them, with as hard as they worked<br/>
keeping me alive, covering them on escape was the lease I could do, I only<br/>
died a once or twice in weeks of hunting there and I don&#39;t think it was ever<br/>
for being the last one.<br/>
