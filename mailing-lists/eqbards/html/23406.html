I didn&#39;t start using instruments to solo until after 18. Then you have two<br/>
songs<br/>
(Chords and Disssonance?) that are AE DOT&#39;s that you can use with Hym and do<br/>
more damage for weapons and you can take on a couple of mobs at the same<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Now at 34 I switch from instruments to weapons depending on the group make<br/>
up.<br/>

<br/>
Being a bard (for me and imo) has been lots of fun. I have done Shaman,<br/>
Mage,<br/>
Warrior, SK, Necro and Chanter and come to my Bard each and every time.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and enjoy!<br/>

Hi all.  This is my first posting here (the group was suggested to me<br/>
on innoruuk.com) so please be kind.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am new to both EQ and being a bard so bear with me.  First of all I<br/>
love my bard!  I initially started a shaman on my boyfriend&#39;s<br/>
suggestion and, while I did like her, she just didn&#39;t have that<br/>
certain something that my bard does.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten her up to level 10 and I&#39;m wondering about musical<br/>
soloing.  Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and<br/>
singing.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with<br/>
instruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out<br/>
using chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>
to kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>
do I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>
and strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>
