<div id="ygrps-yiv-14340521">I&#39;ve read several of the threads on Whineplay as well (but not the actual<br/>
stories).  The entire situation does appear very bizarre.  Will be<br/>
interesting to see how it actually pans out.  One thing is for certain is<br/>
that Lum and Tweety are going to have fun with this.  <br/>

Yea I&#39;m just starting to read some of this thread.  Its pretty crazy.  I am<br/>
not someone who really gets excited about much, but this really irks.<br/>
Enough so to consider action.  The only action I can take, which is not play<br/>
EQ and not pay them any more money.  Perhaps someone who enjoys doing this<br/>
should organize a protest this weekend.  I might even show up for this one<br/>
:-)<br/>
