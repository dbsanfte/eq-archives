   You unfortunatly stumbled into the Necromancer camp and they brought down the scourge of Bertoxxolous on you.  But they will pay in the end.  The glory of Rodcet will shine.<br/>

  Subject: [eqbards] Anyone seen a ghost in Erud?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hello all,<br/>
      Just wondering, has anyone seen a bad ass ghost in the woods outside of Erudin?  For fun and a change of pace, I took my lvl 5 Bard over to Erud to see if there would be any fun hunting.  Of course, I got hopelessly lost in the woods.  Anyway, in the process of asking directions someone who called me a Heretic came up behind me and clubbed me for 132 pts damage!!!  Needless to say, I died but I switched views to see who got me and there was no one there.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
