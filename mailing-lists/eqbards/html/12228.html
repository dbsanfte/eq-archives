<div id="ygrps-yiv-258597711">It did take a TON of resources. it really is not feasable when you take into<br/>
account the server load, and the lines that develop, and DID devolop, along<br/>
with all the cries of dungeon stealer, line cutter, ETC. was not a fun time.<br/>

Sierra&#39;s The Realm did something similar. When you entered a dungeon it was<br/>
<br/>
yours and your parties. There was a delay and the next group would be able<br/>
<br/>
to enter and it would be their own dungeon separate from what the previous<br/>
<br/>
party entered. I dont know if this is feasable in a 3d MMORPG or not...i<br/>
<br/>
would think it would take ALOT of resources...but i could be wrong.<br/>

Something John mentioned touched off a old issue I had in the back of my<br/>
<br/>
mind.  This make take a while to say everything I want so please bear with<br/>
<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like many of you out there, I started playing RPGs in the late 70s and early<br/>
<br/>
80s with high school and college buddies.  First off was AD&D then moved on<br/>
<br/>
to others such as Warhammer and Rolemaster.  Because we always played with<br/>
<br/>
the same group, everyone&#39;s character was always close to one another.  The<br/>
<br/>
GMs would design their dungeons and campaigns based on the level of our<br/>
<br/>
party.  In other words, any dungeon we went into we knew that we could go<br/>
<br/>
from start to finish with the characters we had when we started the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
This was the good old fashioned dungeon crawl.  Traps, puzzles, treasure and<br/>
<br/>
monsters to fight spaced out all along the way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This type of adventuring was what I hoped EQ would be when I first started<br/>
<br/>
playing.  Unfortunately, the way Verant designed every dungeon in the game<br/>
<br/>
precludes the classic dungeon crawl mode of fantasy RPGs.  In every dungeon<br/>
<br/>
you can go to, what you will see is lower level characters at the beginning<br/>
<br/>
of the dungeon, intermediate levels in the middle, and higher level players<br/>
<br/>
in the depths.  Because of the way EQ is designed everyone is forced to camp<br/>
<br/>
because if they tried to go further into the dungeon they are almost<br/>
<br/>
certainly going to die.  This issue has been brought up in numerous EQ<br/>
<br/>
forums and debated until no end.  With that said..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you guys think its possible for a game like EQ to have dungeons where<br/>
<br/>
players can actually complete a dungeon via the dungeon crawl method?  Here<br/>
<br/>
is an example of how it could function:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1)  All dungeons designed where a party of six all within a set range of<br/>
<br/>
levels could defeat every mob within the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Dungeons include traps, locked doors, puzzles, etc to make a rogue a<br/>
<br/>
useful party member.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Spells like wizard lock and barrier type spells included to make the<br/>
<br/>
party safe from wandering mobs and trains.  You go into a room and get into<br/>
<br/>
a fight.  Caster could magically lock the door to keep wandering mobs out.<br/>
<br/>
If you are fighting in a hallway, caster could cast a barrier type spell to<br/>
<br/>
keep wandering mobs from joining in the fight or from following the party.<br/>
<br/>
4)  A mob in each location drops a key required to move on to next area of<br/>
<br/>
dungeon.  Party moves from location to location further down into dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Mobs don&#39;t respawn in an area until the party moves on to next area.<br/>
<br/>
5)  Treasure chests located in specific locations contain minor items and/or<br/>
<br/>
money as a reward for killing the mobs in that location.<br/>
<br/>
6)  Boss mob at the end of the dungeon.  Killing him produces a key that is<br/>
<br/>
used to open up a special treasure chest.  This chest has the rewards in it<br/>
<br/>
for successfully completing the dungeon.  Chest contains money and one magic<br/>
<br/>
item for each member in the party.  Each person only allowed to loot one<br/>
<br/>
item from the chest to ensure everyone gets at least one magic item for<br/>
<br/>
completing the dungeon.  Items in chest random every time it is opened.<br/>
<br/>
7)  One way exit from the dungeon after killing the boss mob so you dont<br/>
<br/>
have to go all the way back to the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
8)  Additional one way exits from dungeon at certain points along the way in<br/>
<br/>
case someone has to leave party for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably a lot of things I have left out but this is the gist of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Implementing something like this would require a radical change in design<br/>
<br/>
philosophy.  I&#39;m not even certain it would be possible in EQ but its<br/>
<br/>
certainly a possibility in EQ2 assuming it comes out a few years down the<br/>
<br/>
road.  Key question is it possible for something like this to work in an<br/>
<br/>
online game?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Without a doubt it will require some kind of control mechanism for parties<br/>
<br/>
to enter the dungeon one at a time and spaced out from one another.  Not<br/>
<br/>
certain how this would work.  Would probably require an online GM/Guide for<br/>
<br/>
each dungeon.  Don&#39;t think you could rely on player cooperation because<br/>
<br/>
there will alwys be people arguing its their turn to go in.  There would<br/>
<br/>
also need to be a mechanism to ensure an orderly progression of parties<br/>
<br/>
within the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m out of time and this has gone on long enough so I&#39;ll end it here.<br/>
<br/>
Apologize for the big-time off topic post but thought the topic was good<br/>
<br/>
enough to throw it out there to get everyone&#39;s opinion.  If this stirs up a<br/>
<br/>
lot of discussion, do you guys think it would be worthwhile to consolidate<br/>
<br/>
all the ideas/opinions everyone has and send them to Verant?<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Not only will you need to camp to get the nice items, you&#39;ll<br/>
<br/>
&gt; find it more and more dangerous to sweep through dungeons<br/>
<br/>
&gt; because mob aggro radii work regardless of LOS.  So you&#39;ll<br/>
<br/>
&gt; probably resort to camping a location if not a mob, and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; pulling to get stuff to kill.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; space they&#39;re packed in (this was done to support the too many<br/>
<br/>
&gt; players).  As a result, any deviation from camping results in<br/>
<br/>
&gt; a high probability of starting a train and/or pissing off<br/>
