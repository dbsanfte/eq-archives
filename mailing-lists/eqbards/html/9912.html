<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-548975157">speaking of which, at some point on this list, someone posted the loc of a<br/>
spawn spot of a griffene, im so sick of wandering around aimlessly with only<br/>
griffawns spawning on me, and the few times i do get a griffene it doesnt<br/>
have the charm. gets annoying to switch bracers all the time so that the<br/>
blue shows instead of my silver plated one.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone able to help me out by giving me a loc of a spawn spot of these<br/>
annoying critters to find<br/>

&gt; Tracking is IMO the best skill in the game.  On night me and another 35th <br/>
&gt; level bard were in N Karana hunting Griffenes for our charms and it was <br/>
&gt; amzaing out fast we could depop the zone of any griffs or hill giants that<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; were unlucky enough to show up on our tracking.  There was even a Guide <br/>
&gt; watching us for part of the night, I guess someone felt we were too <br/>
&gt; successful :)   My partner Ziann had the largest train of the night, he <br/>
&gt; managed to grab 5 griffawns at once, which were quickly dispatch by our<br/>
&gt; 50th <br/>
&gt; level shamen.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger, or forage - but<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My track capped out at 100 i believe. and i find it very very useful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;especially in Solb when there are 40 - 50 people there. I can find that<br/>
&gt; dog<br/>
&gt; &gt;that just spawned before other people.  :)<br/>
