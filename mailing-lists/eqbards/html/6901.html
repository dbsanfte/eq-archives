&gt;If we were to generate a petition, I think more important issues should be<br/>
&gt;covered:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Where the hell are our missing songs?!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quest items.  Spell casters have numerous spells they can&#39;t find, too, so<br/>
it&#39;s not a unique phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) Why do half our skills cap at such a ridiculously low level that they<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t even worth using?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Forage: 40, I get enough food never to starve but I cannot forage special<br/>
items.  My thought is that this is probably intentional.<br/>
Sneak: Still can&#39;t find a use for it, not that it ever advances anyway.<br/>
Pick locks/disarm traps: Even Rogues don&#39;t bother training these skills<br/>
anymore - why should we worry?<br/>
Tracking: My understanding is that by the time you get this, you should<br/>
have had it a LONG time for it to be of use.  :P<br/>
Safe Fall: Well, we&#39;ll never be monks, but I do like that at least normal<br/>
terrain won&#39;t be damaging me any more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3) Is our level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody broken?  If not, what<br/>
&gt;the hell is it supposed to do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This one needs to be sent to Geoffrey Zatkin.  Anyone have his email?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>
&gt;monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is deliberate.  Some of our songs would be WAY too powerful in PvP<br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;5) Why do our songs get stuck due to lag, or when magical effects wear off<br/>
&gt;(i.e. Guise of the Deciever)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a client/server sync issue that they are supposed to be working on.<br/>
 Cute that they even implemented a work-around, though. (/stopsong or just<br/>
/st )<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;6) Why the $#%@#$ does my drum still look like a small wooden twig?  And why<br/>
&gt;does a mino horn now look like a small burlap sack?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey - GZ did say that the next major art patch would fix some of this.  I<br/>
have learned (thanks to Milo Cooper of &quot;Ask Milo&quot; at notcrazy.com) that<br/>
they use what is called &quot;attach points&quot;, and wherever this attach point is,<br/>
is where the item will appear.  Apparently, the attach point for the horn<br/>
was made upside down or something, and the mino bag is just a bad graphic.<br/>
I recently saw two zombies with attach points halfway up their arms -<br/>
really funny looking when they have shields ;)  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;7) How about some high level bard quests?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve said this, too.  Someone recently asked me why there are no<br/>
Bard-quests for Bard instruments (aside from Sylias &quot;Drum&quot; quest).  Didn&#39;t<br/>
have a good answer.  Sad, too.  We really should.  Perhaps assembling the<br/>
parts of a magic Lute or something.<br/>
<br/>
Well, after I&#39;ve hacked your petition to bits, what&#39;s left? ;)<br/>
