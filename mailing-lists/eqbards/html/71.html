&gt; Isn&#39;t the mino horn considered a wind instrument? I also cannot seem<br/>
&gt; to get Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon to work.  Who is supposed to be<br/>
&gt; targeted? the NPC you are buying/selling to? or yourself?  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; spoken to other bards on Povar, and I was told they couldn&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt; song working either.  Would someone please enlighten us as to what we<br/>
&gt; are doing wrong?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The minotaur horn is a wind instrument, like a flute.  For brass you need to<br/>
buy a regular horn (it looks curly, sort of like a french horn).<br/>
<br/>
As to the Carillon, I&#39;m not certain that it is doing very much.  I have used<br/>
it on vendors and had no change in reactions or prices.  I did get one NPC<br/>
to speak with me who would not speak to me before using the song though, so<br/>
it is raising faction a little bit at least.<br/>
