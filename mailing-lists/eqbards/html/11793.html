<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522039622">What is your charisma and dex with all your buffs?  Mine are both 125.  I<br/>
find that I get about 60% resist rates against Griffons and Hill Giants at<br/>
level 30 until the first charm.  At level 27, I got about 25% resist rate<br/>
from Choon and Froon in WK.  After the first, it seems to be very easy to<br/>
get it to stick again.  Once I am successful at charming (the message pops<br/>
up), I immediately switch to Selo and watch the show.  When they stop<br/>
swinging, I hit charm and run backwards until it takes.  I&#39;ve never had an<br/>
occasion where a Hill Giant broke out early and surprised me.   In fact, in<br/>
my experience it has been just the opposite.  I have occasionally gotten a<br/>
whack because I was looking away or reading this list while waiting for the<br/>
charm to break.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is your technique?  I&#39;ve found that after I have successfully<br/>
issued the first /pet attack command, I don&#39;t have to issue it again on each<br/>
subsequent charm unless I want the MOB to switch targets.  Have you tried<br/>
this?  So in other words, I charm with the following technique:<br/>
<br/>
1) Charm a big baddy like a Griffon or HG.<br/>
2) Start running towards it (so that it is in hearing range) and target<br/>
another MOB.  (My first character was a mage, so I had A LOT of experience<br/>
with the pet keys and how close you have to be to the MOB to get it to<br/>
listen to you)<br/>
3) hit the /pet attack Hot Key, making sure I am right next to the charmed<br/>
MOB<br/>
4) immediately hit F1 twice to get my pet targeted<br/>
5) Bring up Selo and wait to re-charm<br/>
6) Hopefully don&#39;t fall asleep at the keyboard before they both start<br/>
charging me again.<br/>
<br/>
I rarely ever change MOBs when charming.  If I do change MOBs, it is near<br/>
the end of the battle when I happen to have the obvious loser.  The more you<br/>
charm a MOB, the more it seems to want to agro on you so it is best to work<br/>
with one MOB only for as long as possible before switching to the soon to be<br/>
winner.<br/>
<br/>
Although I like charm, and I like being able to kill hill giants this way,<br/>
it really really sux in a party and is pretty darn boring after the first 2<br/>
or 3.  I much prefer holding the bar room in Sol A, or going after the<br/>
Efreeti with a party of 6 to watching a couple of giants beat on each other.<br/>
Solo&#39;ing in my opinion just isn&#39;t very much fun and it is just clearly<br/>
boring compared to the non-stop action of a good dungeon.  Last weekend, we<br/>
did a Guild invasion of Sol A.  We held a good portion of the dungeon with<br/>
two well balanced parties of 6.  A bard and snarer (ranger or druid), a<br/>
greater healer (shaman or cleric) and good tanks in each party, excessive<br/>
use of lullaby, hymn, anthem.  Now that was TRULY what this game is supposed<br/>
to be about!<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend, while level 30, I was using a Hill Giant to kill Grifeenes for<br/>
me in NK.  After about 10, the HG was low enough on hitpoints that me and my<br/>
druid buddy could finish it off pretty easily.  Finally got my second bracer<br/>
:-).<br/>

&gt; Well, I am getting better with charm ;p<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I am really serious, I will swap in all my cha stuff (crude<br/>
&gt; stein, drosco<br/>
&gt; amulet, silk evening tunic), remember to dequip my StoW, beg a SoW or have<br/>
&gt; someone sing Selos.  I have not actually used all my extra cha<br/>
&gt; stuff since I<br/>
&gt; got my guise and that might really help.  I could try for a cha<br/>
&gt; buff from an<br/>
&gt; enchanter but if there is an enchanter - wtf am I doing the charming for?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But what seems to be the stumbling block for me is the weaving.  I have a<br/>
&gt; charm pallette set with charm and selos hot keyed and am getting better at<br/>
&gt; using it.  Even so, when charm sticks, it seems that I just barely have<br/>
&gt; enough time to cast charm, cast selos and then need to immediately re-cast<br/>
&gt; charm (cuz it broke and they are both charging at me now.)  The<br/>
&gt; duration of<br/>
&gt; my charm seems very very short.  I can barely charm, target mob, hit /pet<br/>
&gt; attack hot key, f1-f1 retarget pet before it breaks and I am<br/>
&gt; scrambling for<br/>
&gt; a re-cast of charm.  But like I say - I am getting better!  And I really<br/>
&gt; should try all my  cha stuff now - not just the stein.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I have found that fear + chain is really good for soloing but it<br/>
&gt; really helps to run them in the right order.  I have been doing Avo&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; Centaurs in South Karana lately.  I track a target and get close.<br/>
&gt;  Then fear<br/>
&gt; them and auto-attack.  Now chain then fear again.  If I do this a<br/>
&gt; few times,<br/>
&gt; it gives me sufficient &#39;lead&#39; on the mob in hp loss.  Once I get<br/>
&gt; a bub or so<br/>
&gt; ahead of him, I will wince him with Denons.  But once I go to 3 song<br/>
&gt; rotation, I expect to take some hits.  Prolly should be doing:<br/>
&gt; fear, chain,<br/>
&gt; fear, denon, fear, chain, fear, denon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I never learned to kite things.  I don&#39;t have the patience for those<br/>
&gt; long drawn out solo fights.  I much prefer to be in a party with<br/>
&gt; good tanks<br/>
&gt; - I don&#39;t mind melee myself if we have good casters.  So, I have<br/>
&gt; not put the<br/>
&gt; time in to learn how to do solo stuff. I&#39;d try a couple and spent too much<br/>
&gt; time either dieing or zoning and then give up and go get in a group<br/>
&gt; somewhere or grab a partner.<br/>

&gt; 		Sylly, no offense, you seem to have trouble charming? (just<br/>
&gt; from your<br/>
&gt; 		post here) One misconception I think many Bards have is that<br/>
&gt; you sing<br/>
&gt; 		charm, it works and you sit back and watch the show. This is<br/>
&gt; not true.<br/>
&gt; 		I&#39;d say charm fails at LEAST 50%, maybe 75% some times. The<br/>
&gt; trick is to<br/>
&gt; 		weave charm and selo&#39;s(with drum) so you can run backwards<br/>
&gt; from the<br/>
&gt; 		targets and re-sing charm as many times as needed. During a<br/>
&gt; particularly<br/>
&gt; 		bad run yesterday I had to sing charm NINE times before I<br/>
&gt; charmed my HG.<br/>
