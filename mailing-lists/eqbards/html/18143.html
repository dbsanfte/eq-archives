<div id="ygrps-yiv-934932368">Does this answer your question Papa???   Eq toys spawning in offices???<br/>
What&#39;s next, a replica Misty Thicket popping up in our web development<br/>
team&#39;s home &quot;zone&quot;.  &quot;Careful you don&#39;t aggro Mooto, it&#39;s a long run to the<br/>
guards&quot;<br/>

Sometimes you just have to know when to drop the chalupa and back away<br/>

designed the person who posted it made a bit of a typo and stated the toys<br/>
would be between 6 inches and 8 feet.  (Was that on this list?)  Here we<br/>
were, all plotting which co-workers cubicles we&#39;d choose as spawn points for<br/>
giant (four foot we figured) spiders, debating whether to place Broon or a<br/>
Seafury Cyclopse in our front yards, wondering if willowisps would include<br/>
batteries, and if so, would they be dead...<br/>
