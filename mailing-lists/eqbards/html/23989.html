&gt;That&#39;s only true if the opposing segments are of equal size.  When bards are<br/>
&gt;a 4% segment out of 14 unallied segments none totaling over 15% they are<br/>
&gt;significant.  When pvp is 7% out of two total segments where the other<br/>
&gt;segment is 93% they are insignificant.  To balance the effects on the whole<br/>
&gt;population of anything because of the effect on that 7% is patently unsound.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually the 14 unallied segments would actually be allied for most of  the bard<br/>

&gt;agree that &gt;...<br/>
&gt; &gt;what bards can do don&#39;t want to work that hard when they are playing a<br/>
&gt;game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not likely.  The reason more people don&#39;t play them is because the return on<br/>
&gt;the work invested is not proportionate.  Unless you truly enjoy the actual<br/>
&gt;work involved, there is no reason to play a bard.  Some people do enjoy the<br/>
&gt;constant challenge despite the fact it is not rewarded equivalently to the<br/>
&gt;lesser challenges of other classes.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but class balance has nothing to do with the balance between return on work and<br/>
work invested.  it has everything to do with Class A&#39;s fullest potential vs Class B&#39;s<br/>
fullest potential.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i dunno what nietzschian is, but by your definition, that actually seems to describe<br/>
the bard class to a T.   you can take the easy way out and play mana song all the<br/>
time and still get experience, depending on how good your group is and how safe<br/>
the areas you hunt are, or you can do the hard stuff and learn how to cc or learn<br/>
how to pull, or twist multiple songs to make your group much much better.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>are you denying that there are people out there who are ignorant or who are lazy?<br/>
how about this analogy?  why aren&#39;t you a professional baseball player making millions<br/>
of dollars a year?  The reward is there.  Some would say the reward is much more than<br/>
the work put in.  Is it arrogant to say that you aren&#39;t doing it because you are incapable<br/>
of playing baseball at that level?  I think it&#39;s being honest.</div>
