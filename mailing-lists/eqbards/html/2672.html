<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899182975">Good to know, especially since I just tested the &quot;Accelerando breaks root<br/>
even underground&quot; theory.  And at least in Runnyeye, it most definitely<br/>
does not.  Maybe they just fixed it in this patch.  But as of today, it<br/>
does not break root.<br/>

&gt;&gt; These songs are rendered basically useless in a group setting because of<br/>
&gt;&gt; how they cancel their equivelent spell effects. So my question is, is this<br/>
&gt;&gt; a bug or a feature? I am torn between wanting to be able to cancel roots<br/>
&gt;&gt; and not cancel sow&#39;s. Ideally i would like to be able cancel roots and not<br/>
&gt;&gt; screw up a sow. Either way i would love to hear an official answer. The<br/>

&gt;I *think* the L22 song (Disenchantment) does exactly this<br/>
&gt;without screwing up &quot;good&quot; song effects.  I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>
&gt;test it but it&#39;s been difficult.  I managed to play it once<br/>
&gt;when I got rooted last night, and it seemed to unroot me.  But<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t be sure if it really unrooted me, or if root just<br/>
&gt;naturally expired at the same moment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By the way, root cancels SoW.  If your party is running for<br/>
&gt;the zone and someone gets rooted, you&#39;re usually better off<br/>
&gt;hitting Accelerando to unroot him and give him back some speed<br/>
&gt;to get to the zone.  (For that matter, SoW cancels root.)<br/>
