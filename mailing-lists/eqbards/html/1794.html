<div id="ygrps-yiv-922683551">I am a 12th level Bard on The Rathe. I now have roughly 65 skill in 1H <br/>
slashing and find myself wanting to explore other weapon types. I am <br/>
planning on building my 1H blunt and piercing after reviewing the array of <br/>
&quot;special&quot; weapons available in these areas at later levels. I equipped a <br/>
dagger and began my task. Then I wondered about what to fight. If I fight <br/>
blue mobs, I can&#39;t kill them fast enough without running and sometimes <br/>
zoning if I can&#39;t get my Mino axe out in time to save my worthless hide.<br/>
<br/>
I assume if I begin with green con mobs, my skill won&#39;t go up... Or will it?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any suggestions for a strategy here?<br/>
