&gt;That&#39;s bull. Sure, it may be true for some people, but most druids I know<br/>
&gt;(including myself) are constant groupers. Grouping is where the fun is at.<br/>
&gt;However, it&#39;s not fun to be decent at some things (DD and heal) for 30<br/>
&gt;levels, then suddenly have half your ability taken away (DDs resisted) and<br/>
&gt;your other main ability fade away slowly (no heals above greater heal).<br/>
&gt;Yes, you can still be very useful. But no longer can you be, to a group,<br/>
&gt;what you&#39;ve been for 30 levels (a nuker or healer as needed). That&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;hard change to make -- especially when Verant keeps waving in your face<br/>
&gt;&quot;you&#39;re the second/third best nukers in the game!&quot; but decline to mention<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s IF you&#39;re not resisted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kind of like how they go &quot;you have the best root in the game! it roots AND<br/>
&gt;does damage!&quot; Sure.. at level 30, that 10dmg with a root is really worth<br/>
&gt;the extra 40% resists..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, getting pretty off topic here.. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see you read the editorial on EQvault about druids too.  My druid is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>using<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;ensnare.. and THAT gets resisted quite a bit, as does immolate (I stopped<br/>
&gt;using it)  Basically, in places like Solusek, I&#39;ve been using things like<br/>
&gt;damage shields, lightning (give me a break 99 damage? HAH), crud,  and<br/>
&gt;tremor where appropriate.  I&#39;ve been grouping with mostly the same ppl<br/>
 </span></blockquote>since<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;level 7, too.  Thank goodness they are friends, or my druid would soon not<br/>
&gt;have a group.  Still at level 30 too.  (I hate to see what the higher<br/>
 </span></blockquote>levels<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;are like.. UGH!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now.. as for ON TOPIC.. my bard finally made level 20 last night!! woohoo!!<br/>
&gt;Never thought I&#39;d see the day, since my poor bard has died at least 3 times<br/>
&gt;every level since 15.  It was getting so bad, my regular group started<br/>
&gt;calling me &quot;bard bait&quot; heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Theres no doubt Verant needs to do some more tweaking on the classes.<br/>
