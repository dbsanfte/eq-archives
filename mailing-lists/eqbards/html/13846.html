cleric.  While being almost completely devoted to helping<br/>
other players is nice, I didn&#39;t want to be blamed for other<br/>
people&#39;s stupidity.  &quot;I died!  Why didn&#39;t you heal me?&quot; when<br/>
everyone else was at full hp and he wouldn&#39;t back off the mob <br/>
beating him up.<br/>

stops a mob from moving is *lower* than the point at which<br/>
they start running?  So you darkness it, beat it up, it starts<br/>
to run, then after a few hits its frozen.<br/>
