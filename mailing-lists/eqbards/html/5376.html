<div id="ygrps-yiv-218526020">I think a lot of you people gushing about how easy it is to make money via<br/>
loot are exaggerating.  I have a 23rd monk that works his butt off and he&#39;s<br/>
never had more than about 125pp in the bank at any one time.  I&#39;ve spent time<br/>
in unrest.  Where&#39;s the money there?  FS weapons?  The cash drops aren&#39;t<br/>
*that* great.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired of reading about<br/>
how others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>

&gt; Aye, its all relative. Plats are very easy to get even after level 20. I<br/>
&gt; have never had less than 100 in the bank since then and almost always over<br/>
&gt; 1000. Today I am buying Blk Pearl Plat earrings and will have up to 1000 to<br/>
&gt; blow on failures and if they all fail the only thing thats a pain is getting<br/>
&gt; 4 more BPs to play with. Replacing the 1000 is really easy. This is why I<br/>
&gt; love the bazaars, I trade basically useless Plats for awesome items I or my<br/>
&gt; friends can actually use, what a great concept.<br/>
