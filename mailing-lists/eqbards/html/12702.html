<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061454704">Hello all ,     <br/>
<br/>
    I have been 46 for a good while now , and plan to start playing more soon <br/>
... going on dragon raids etc. and i am looking for info and what equipment i <br/>
should own. i thought this info had already been posted , but i looked and i <br/>
couldn&#39;t find the email. so if anyone could post what they wear to get high <br/>
resistances. i would really appreciate it. <br/>
