<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763408314">Glad to see that DC is like that - I think there are a LOT of great guilds<br/>
on Xegony like DC, and VS, and my guild - but see Brill&#39;s post a few down<br/>
about what often typifies the &quot;Ghetto&quot; Server...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to join you guys on a raid sometime - give me a tell or send me an<br/>
email.  You guys (and another guild I believe) beat us up to Hate Monday (I<br/>
hope no BP&#39;s dropped &lt;veg&gt;) But it was a good night for DoK as we got three<br/>
members epic items instead of going to Hate.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sounds like you are in a great guilds where people work<br/>

&gt; very common (especially from what I&#39;ve seen on Xegony).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bah! Let me know when you want to come on a DC raid, Slyde, you might<br/>
be surprised with what you see. (Maybe this is why DC was<br/>
tagged &quot;Friendliest Uber Guild on Xegony&quot; -- not that I would<br/>
consider us &quot;Uber&quot;.)</div>
