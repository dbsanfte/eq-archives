<div id="ygrps-yiv-864375378"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   For all purposes, this new song resemebles the Enchanter<br/>
&gt;   Berserker Strength spell across all party members.<br/>
&gt;   It has half the range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando, and slightly<br/>
&gt;   more range than Hymm, and close to equal range of Chant of Battle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Ooops, forgot the Healing aspect.  Identical in numerics <br/>
    to Hymm.  However it is applied will be a different story.<br/>
    (It could have a very low fixed ceiling, as could all the<br/>
    effects in this description)  I&#39;m not sure how bardic level<br/>
    will influence this song, but since it&#39;s L47 I doubt the<br/>
    effects will increase much in 3 levels.  Just pure speculation<br/>
    and assumption on my part based on the data file.  I&#39;d hate<br/>
    to say this is anything more than an educated guess.<br/>
