<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Sebilis Keys(forager and hunter spawns) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806368462">I have extensively hunted the forager and hunter spawns.  The hunter USUALLY<br/>
spawns in the local of a small tower directly out from the EJ zone.  The<br/>
forager spawns near some large ruins along the river out from the swamp<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
Until the tracking changes are completed...the easiest way to initially<br/>
pickup either the forager or the hunter on track is to use a druid, and next<br/>
best case a bard.  Druids have a reduced range of tracking and are most<br/>
likely to see the forager or hunter on their &quot;radar&quot; in the more densely<br/>
populated areas.  Once either the forager or hunter are killed once...a<br/>
ranger, bard or druid can pull them easily, as they show at the top of<br/>
track.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, the forager and hunter NEVER have a mundane placeholder.<br/>
It is either them or a rare spawn, which spawns immediately after the<br/>
previous mob is killed.  I have also noticed that sometimes the forager or<br/>
hunter spawns far away from their normal spawn points..down near the<br/>
entrance to the undead city that holds the Sebilis entrance. Very rarely I<br/>
have also seen two foragers or hunters on track as well.<br/>
