<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656516573">I know for a fact that I used to get flashing icons, I remember thinking how<br/>
different it was from my ranger to see constantly flashing icons ALL THE<br/>
TIME.<br/>
<br/>
As for bard icons flashing, I don&#39;t care either way. But I DO want my<br/>
regular buffs to flash before wearing off. I would be satisfied with several<br/>
in particular:<br/>
<br/>
Enduring Breath<br/>
Invisibility<br/>
Invisibility to Undead<br/>
Levitation<br/>
Illusions (dark elf, erudite, iksar, and whatever other masks the make for<br/>
us)<br/>
<br/>
All of these spells carry your our lives in their hands. If they break at<br/>
the wrong time without us knowing it&#39;s coming, we are dead. The more I think<br/>
about it, the more certain I&#39;m going to post to the official boards, I just<br/>
keep forgetting to test Kit&#39;s theory on the icons not flashing only when<br/>
we&#39;re singing. Hopefully I&#39;ll remember tonight.<br/>

<br/>
This is a REALLY late response but here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Bards don&#39;t get flashing icons and never have (to my knowledge).  Our group<br/>
members do.  For a groupmate of a bard the icon will flash.  For the bard<br/>
it&#39;s on solid.  TRUST ME you don&#39;t want flashing icons.  Icons start to<br/>
flash roughly 15 seconds before a spell effect wears off, this means our<br/>
icons would ALWAYS flash since our song duration is shorter than the<br/>
flash-warning time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
