<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148745569">There is an underlying story.  Try talking to the Clothspinner woman in<br/>
North Qeynos and delivering the note to her sister.  See what happens after<br/>
you do.  Or actually hang out around the front gates and listen to the<br/>
guards.  Another one will come up and start talking to the other one and<br/>
then return where he came from.  See where he goes and look around....<br/>
<br/>
There is more to the game than hack and slash, I assure you.<br/>

&gt; Ok, now you have me hooked.  I HATE Kithicor!  It is the most scary place<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have been - so far.  But I keep going back!  I have had Ged make me his<br/>
&gt; Bearskin gloves and am looking for a HQ LION to get the finest ones in all<br/>
&gt; of Norrath.  Jed&#39;s druid friend - she won&#39;t talk to me not even with my<br/>
&gt; cha<br/>
&gt; song.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is anyone keeping track of the various inter-twining of these kind of<br/>
&gt; things?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example, talking to Furball Miller on the Miller farm. His sad story<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; woe.  Then, there is the letter from the DE that the halfling in the<br/>
&gt; Hogcallers Inn has (part of the Lady Shae quest.) I got the letter and<br/>
&gt; read<br/>
&gt; it.  It implies that you can get a special thing if you deliver it to the<br/>
&gt; correct person. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wonder if there is some underlying tale about Norrath or are these just<br/>
&gt; independent little quest things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; 		&gt;Finally someone else notices...I get sick of those messages<br/>
&gt; that say<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;something like, &quot;We need to get rid of useless<br/>
&gt; zones....like Kithicor&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Heehee! What the &quot;Levelquest&quot; people miss in their mad dash<br/>
&gt; to &quot;win&quot;!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		&gt;I adventured there for more than a few levels, and I still<br/>
&gt; get a kick out of<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;that dark place...Have you ever met Kithicor himself?  I<br/>
&gt; saw him once by the<br/>
&gt; 		&gt;cabin with the grizzley bears and the flag.  He didn&#39;t say<br/>
&gt; much...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Want to hear some suspicions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		I think Ged and his Girlfriend (not recalling he name) are<br/>
&gt; either dead (we are talking to their<br/>
&gt; 		ghosts) or cursed. He (or she, likely she) may be a<br/>
&gt; werewolf. I think they had a nice little house<br/>
&gt; 		in the Kithicor until it was burned down or destroyed in<br/>
&gt; some manner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		That lake, that lake *sigh* there is something UP with it<br/>
&gt; (besides two piranha).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Anyway we have a bunch of really weird data points about it,<br/>
&gt; which might be random, but might NOT<br/>
&gt; 		be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Truth is out there<br/>
&gt; 		:o)<br/>
