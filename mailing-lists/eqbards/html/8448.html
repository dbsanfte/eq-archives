&gt;assured me again today that he does have them.  Either he&#39;s <br/>
&gt;misinformed, or the stones are already present in the world <br/>
&gt;and simply not well-distributed (relatively speaking).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I killed over 12 hill giants yesterday and a hand full of griffons.<br/>
Not one of them dropped a Lament Stone.  I killed some green fenes<br/>
too looking for a charm, nada.  I also killed the Gargoyles in LGuk <br/>
several times without seeing a Carapace and the shin froggies<br/>
without seeing greave or glove.<br/>

None of these items are instated on the live servers.  However, they<br/>
are pretty common finds on said monsters on Test.  (ie. Aviak charms<br/>
from Avocets - that common)<br/>
