<div id="ygrps-yiv-873450508">More balanced then bards are in the level range that manaless charm is<br/>
available. Their ability to solo is balanced by downtime.  A bard solo&#39;ing<br/>
with charm has zero downtime.<br/>

It is the primary reason druid and necromancer abilities have been nerfed<br/>
for the last ohh 2 years.<br/>

I hardly think that being able to solo is the measure of whether a class is<br/>
balanced.<br/>

Bards are way overpowered from 27 to about 40th due to Charm.  The combo of<br/>
charm plus speed faster then sow is pretty overpowered.  Post 40th bards<br/>
slowly start losing power till 53 with Song of Twilight.  With SoT you can<br/>
solo anything in the game that this song will stick on.  The only place<br/>
bards are really weak is in raid situations, in areas with 54+ mobs, or when<br/>
grouped with an Enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
As for DDD it is great for duels as very few people expect a bard to<br/>
suddenly let loose with a nice nuke like that.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I am surprised the VI has not added mana usage to 27th lvl charm<br/>
to balance it.  It is a hideously power song :)<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m so disappointed it hurts. Why bother trying to &quot;balance&quot; the classes if<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why bother trying to discuss class balance if you&#39;re not going to even look<br/>
at the possibility<br/>
that bards are overpowered already?  And if you won&#39;t accept that if bards<br/>
are currently overpowered<br/>
compared to other classes as a whole that they won&#39;t get major improvements<br/>
while some other<br/>
classes will, then I predict you are about to be even more disappointed.<br/>
