<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557541828">I travel on business way too much, so I only get to play weekends and <br/>
holidays.  I got a few extra days between Xmas and New Years, here&#39;s how <br/>
they went:<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday - Spent a lot of time in Oasis killing specters, giants and the <br/>
occasional DW goblin.  Specters were camped, giants spawn slowly, not <br/>
much exp.  Spent a couple of hours with a tired and overeager guild group <br/>
in Paw, got run out of zone three times, not much exp.  (Those snakes are <br/>
cool, though.)  Net 1/2 bubble of 35.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday - Spent 8 hours at the top of 4c pyramid in Cazic.  Great group, <br/>
no deaths, last two bubbles of 35, sliver of 36.<br/>
<br/>
Friday - Off.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday - Spent 8 hours at the top of 4c pyramid again, with a <br/>
completely different group. Great group, no deaths, got 4 plus bubbles of <br/>
36, taking me to a sliver under 37.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday - Most guild members who are on are in Planes, spent an hour <br/>
apiece in each of three dungeons, /auctioning for a group (no responses), <br/>
/oocing if rooms were taken (they all were), /telling the few people I <br/>
knew if they had space (they didn&#39;t, and wouldn&#39;t for hours).  Spent four <br/>
hours running around to all the places where I thinnk I can solo <br/>
something, all camped up the wazoo.  Net:  7 hours, killed three blue <br/>
things solo.  Still a sliver under 37.  How do I avoid another one of <br/>
these days?  Or is this the price I pay for having a job which didn&#39;t <br/>
permit me to powerlevel my way to 50?  Am I not patient enough?  Am I <br/>
supposed to pick a dungeon and sit on my heinie for four hours until <br/>
something opens up?  Is this fun?<br/>
