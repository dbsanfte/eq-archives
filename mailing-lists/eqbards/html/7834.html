&gt;&gt; conversation.  No matter how you or anyone feels about<br/>
&gt;&gt; it, and we&#39;ve seen many many long winded posts, Verant<br/>
&gt;&gt; won&#39;t do it.   Period.  All that&#39;s left is pointlessly<br/>
&gt;&gt; arguing over why Verant &quot;should&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Eeent. Next contestant please. You&#39;re wrong. Period.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They said rearrangable spellbooks (my favorite example<br/>
&gt;at the moment) would never happen. Guess what..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah but rearrangeable spellbooks are not a balance issue of the game. There<br/>
were no downsides of it, no impact to determine. Not a single person was<br/>
upset about it. No one created a petition about it after it was put in.<br/>
<br/>
Giving bind to one class would make many people upset (&quot;If they get it, why<br/>
can&#39;t we??&quot;). Giving it to ALL classes would completely change the dynamics<br/>
of the game.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t say that it will not happen, though I seriously doubt it will. But,<br/>
I will say that rearrangebale spellbooks are a very bad example. :)<br/>
