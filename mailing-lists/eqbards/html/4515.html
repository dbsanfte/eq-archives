&gt; And this is part of the beauty of the Bard.  Each Bard makes his or her own<br/>
&gt; choices on what to memorize.  Like our choices of weapons and armour, at<br/>
&gt; early levels we might all choose similar things, but as we advance in<br/>
&gt; levels our choices will often diverge, leaving us more individual.  I, too,<br/>
&gt; often wish I had a few extra slots, but then I realize that instead of<br/>
&gt; depending on my songs to bail me out, the limitations force me to examine<br/>
&gt; my strategies a lot more.<br/>

group with another bard.  :-)<br/>

However, there is one minor issue in the original poster&#39;s<br/>
favor.  Casters get meditate.  If they want to cast an<br/>
unmemorized spell, they sit, memorize it in 2 seconds, pop up,<br/>
cast it, sit down, and rememorize the original.  Total time -<br/>
less than 10 seconds.  If a bard wants to use an unmemorized<br/>
song (e.g. see invisible to check for invisible campers), you<br/>
sit down, memorize for 15-30 seconds, pop up, sing the song,<br/>
sit down, and rememorize the original for another 15-30<br/>
seconds.  It can take well over a minute to do all this.<br/>
