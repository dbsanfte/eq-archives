<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049832080">Have to agree -- until you start a serious charming career, go with strength.  It is probably most important at lower lvls too because you wear heavier armor then.  <br/>

that, else use the CHA.  At 11 I was always looking for STR as I was<br/>
wearing all bronze and heavy weapons.  I didn&#39;t start trading in my STR for<br/>
CHA until I was getting lighter gear.<br/>
