<div id="ygrps-yiv-491370821">I&#39;m not too sure about that.  It may just be that things look screwy<br/>
when fighting clops/giants.  I know that I can melee them while standing<br/>
much farther back than I ever could Dervishes.  It seems like it might be<br/>
the same physical range, but since the clops/giants are so much larger, and<br/>
have a larger melee range, it makes it seem like you&#39;re closer to them than<br/>
to the dervishes.  If you remember, try running back to a dervish camp, and<br/>
see how it compares.  Or I&#39;ll try tonight or tomorrow.<br/>

&gt; Speaking of which - they sure seem to have nerfed the range of bellows.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t pull a lot because I have a poor sense of direction - but did so for<br/>
&gt; the first time in ages Sunday night in Rathe Mtn - and it sure seemed that<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; had to get a LOT closer to those Cyclops than I had to get to the<br/>
&gt; Dervish&#39;s<br/>
&gt; way back when....<br/>
