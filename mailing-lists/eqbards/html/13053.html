<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447065574">I agree, once the situation is irrecoverable, the casters are free to<br/>
gate in my opinion. I saw a post from Abashi where he said he did not<br/>
mem gate when grouping with warriors... go figure.  <br/>
<br/>
Once ZONE is called i think everyone should make their BEST way out.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, i&#39;d say 90% of my deaths are from this scenario. Group calls ZONE,<br/>
everyone runs and some gate. I hit selo&#39;s and start to run, only to heal<br/>
HELP me from some unsowed partner, i circle back to pick them up, they<br/>
get selo&#39;s and make it out, i attract mob and die.<br/>

&gt; &gt; If the casters in your group gate out and leave you to<br/>
&gt; &gt; die, they are not good groupies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What are they supposed to do - stay and die with you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a caster gates out before the call to &quot;ZONE!&quot; is made, then<br/>
&gt; I agree they&#39;re not good groupies.  But once the call is made,<br/>
&gt; for me it becomes a problem of &quot;how do we get out of this<br/>
&gt; situation with the fewest number of deaths.&quot;  Just about all<br/>
&gt; permutations of solutions to that problem involve the casters<br/>
&gt; gating out ASAP.<br/>
