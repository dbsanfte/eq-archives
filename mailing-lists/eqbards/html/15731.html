&gt; How in the world to people obtain Ykeshas these days?  I heard they used to<br/>
&gt; drop a lot more often but this is absurd.  Yesterday I logged on at 11am CST<br/>
&gt; in lguk and joined a Savant group, sent a tell to the list holder of the<br/>
&gt; Lord group and started killing frogs.  I was finally called for my turn in<br/>
&gt; the Lord group at 6pm CST, 7 hours later.  Shortly after I arrived one of<br/>
&gt; the people ahead of me on the list fell asleep after an 18 hour camp and the<br/>
&gt; guy after him got a Yak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The group changed a couple times in the next hour so by 8pm I was on the top<br/>
&gt; of the list for a Yak, 2 hours after joining the group.  We then camped the<br/>
&gt; room and I finally gave up with no Yak (5 SSB&#39;s) at 2:30am, 7 and a half<br/>
&gt; hours and no Yak.  By the time I left I was the only original group member<br/>
&gt; left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Meanwhile people continue to berate me for wielding a staff of writhing at<br/>
&gt; 42nd level.  What&#39;s a bard to do, has it always been this tough of a camp?<br/>
&gt; This is totally absurd.<br/>
