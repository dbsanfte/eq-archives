<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198316629"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hi, just visited MM for the first time on late Saturday night (prolly<br/>
&gt;the worst time, few ppl there, so I saw and died to several trains).  My<br/>
&gt;question is where can my group and I hunt there (I&#39;m 21, the group<br/>
&gt;ranges to 26) fairly safely?  (The idea is to be in the zone for a while<br/>
&gt;and /auction WTB MM drum.  Anyone have a clue what those would go for?)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>IMHO, Mistmoore is better with few people -- as long as you don&#39;t<br/>
have anyone incompetent trying to hunt the castle. The castle trains<br/>
are what really kill you. We head for zone if we see anyone in<br/>
steel armor, or anyone hunched over out in the courtyard. That&#39;s castle<br/>
stuff and WAY too high for us.<br/>
<br/>
At 20, Anna and I are staying out in the courtyard (down the ramp from<br/>
the zone... There is a pathing problem trying to get things up to the zone<br/>
that makes that not a good place to fight. If you fight up on the hill<br/>
next to the lake, then you might manage to avoid attracting the attention<br/>
of some of the castle trains if you&#39;re VERY quiet and lucky.) Occasionally,<br/>
she will try a pull, with a full group, of a glyphed from the graveyard.<br/>
I do not know what level these are, but just one is a good fight for us,<br/>
even with groups ranging up to about 25. It may depend somewhat on<br/>
what classes are the various levels. You might want to start in the<br/>
courtyard<br/>
pulling from the graveyard, and only move to the graveyard if you&#39;re<br/>
handling that<br/>
pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
I know, the last time we were in Mistmoore, the 25 druid/paladin team with<br/>
us<br/>
was anxious to move to graveyard. We chose not to because Anna and I were<br/>
not comfortable enough with survivability there.<br/>
