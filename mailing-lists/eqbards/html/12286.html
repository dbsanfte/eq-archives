&gt; Excellent info.  I see you skipped McVaxius Berserker<br/>
&gt; Crescendo.  Does anyone even use that?  I always just take<br/>
&gt; the time to weave celerity and chant of battle.  Love the<br/>

increased speedup of Beserkers was not that impressive over<br/>
Celerity, the song greatly increased your chances of dual<br/>
wielding/double attacking.  One fellow there said he used one<br/>
of those logfile parsers to check his average damage using<br/>
Beserkers vs Celerity/Chant, and it was much higher using<br/>
Beserkers even though Celerity/Chant gave better visible<br/>
modifiers.  I&#39;m still 5 bubbles away from that song so YMMV.<br/>
