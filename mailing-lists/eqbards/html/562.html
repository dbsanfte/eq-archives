<div id="ygrps-yiv-555037676">Languages are made avaliable at your local trainer based on level. The more<br/>
&#39;advanced/complex/rare&#39; languages are at higher levels. I just learned<br/>
Kobold at the trainer and I&#39;ve never seen one before nor heard anyone speak<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
As for a dwarf being able to convers with humans in the common tongue, why<br/>
do you thing they call it the &#39;common tongue&#39;? Besides, it wouldn&#39;t be a fun<br/>
game if two friends played, one being a human and the other a dwarf, and<br/>
neither could understand the other in any situation.<br/>

Maybe I am incorrect, but I am under the impression that you need<br/>
to &#39;hear&#39; a language before you are given the option of training<br/>
a point in it.<br/>
<br/>
I never had gnoll, dark speech, elder tier&#39;dal (sp?) available as<br/>
language options until later in the game (presumably after I had<br/>
heard it in my travels).<br/>
Maybe the languages have level restrictions?  That would also explain<br/>
it.<br/>
But even Barbarian or Dwarf were not available to me to train in<br/>
until a friend spoke to me in these languages.<br/>
<br/>
And following this thread of conversation, am I relatively alone in<br/>
my hatred for the &#39;common tongue&#39; language?  While I am not a hard-<br/>
core role-player, I find that it seriously detracts from the role-<br/>
playing experience.<br/>
Honestly, how realistic is it for a dwarf, having grown up in<br/>
Kelethin, travelling to Freeport and easily able to converse with<br/>
humans?<br/>
