&gt;I&#39;m only 14th level and with deadlines for my graduate thesis quickly<br/>
&gt;approaching, it may be a long time before I get the chance to discover the<br/>
&gt;answer to these questions for myself so I&#39;m gonna go ahead and ask them now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Everyone knows the bard is #1 on the hit list for enemy creatures.  In my<br/>
&gt;most recent skirmishes with the Dervish Cutthroats, I continually found<br/>
&gt;myself taking the brunt of the damage even though there were tanks in the<br/>
&gt;group.  Even when I tried to back up and quit attacking due to low health<br/>
&gt;the cutthroats continued to attack me even though I was doing no damage to<br/>
&gt;them.  The end result is that I ended up dying a couple of times when other<br/>
&gt;members of my group ended up taking either zero or little damage in the<br/>
&gt;fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am hoping that when I gain the ability to sing the Lullaby and<br/>
&gt;Invisibility song my survivability rate will vastly improve.  Here is how I<br/>
&gt;assume they work so would like confirmation if my assumptions are correct.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For the Lullaby, if I am getting attacked by more than one creature, I<br/>
&gt;assume that I will be able to sing the Lullaby while in combat, put them to<br/>
&gt;sleep, and then either attack them one at a time or gain enough time so I<br/>
&gt;can safely run away (I know this is cowardly but hey in the end you got to<br/>
&gt;look out for your own well-being:-)  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The lullaby is a difficult song to use imo. I try and use it only when we<br/>
are getting nailed by a bunch of greens, its quite effective then. If its<br/>
two or more blues, depending on the situation i will use it. What happens<br/>
with the lullaby is that monsters wake up frequently if they are not green<br/>
and while i have heard everywhere that the s. list is cleared, the bard<br/>
singing the lullaby becomes the primary target when the creature wakes up,<br/>
most likely because he was singing at the time or maybe because the monster<br/>
does remember being put to sleep. So if you have a cleric in the group and<br/>
can tank a bit, you can cut the damage down the party would normally take<br/>
by quite a bit. The negative is that it is all directed too you. So  as far<br/>
as not making you the brunt of the attack, no, this song is no help :)<br/>
Its also great for when the party needs to flee but you have full health<br/>
and can tank a bit. I am sure it has a few more uses that i am forgetting,<br/>
but this is one song that gets a precious spell slot pretty much 100% of<br/>
the time for me, even at lvl 30. Course maybe thats because my brass skill<br/>
is so horrible and the appallinig screech takes so long to start up :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For the Invisibility song, I assume that if I turn off the AutoAttack, start<br/>
&gt;singing the song, then I and the rest of the party will become invisible.<br/>
&gt;Party members who continue to attack the creatures will become visible upon<br/>
&gt;their next attack.  If I continue to sing the song and never attack again, I<br/>
&gt;assume that I will be safe for the duration of the combat.  This all assumes<br/>
&gt;that the creatures I am fighting can&#39;t detect invisibility.  Also, if I am<br/>
&gt;singing the Invisibility song and not attacking the creatures, and then<br/>
&gt;start twisting a song that benefits the party like Hymn or Anthem, will I<br/>
&gt;stay invisible.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Invisibility will not work if the creature has already added you to his s.<br/>
list, and guess what. Bards are first on any monsters s. list. Even if you<br/>
never attacked him and he sees any of your party members, then he can now<br/>
see you and will proceed to attack. The only good thing about the invis<br/>
song that i have found is the fact that it pulses, so if somebody bends<br/>
down to loot and subsequently becomes visible, the next pulse will invis<br/>
him while he loots. Great if no monsters are about at the time but you are<br/>
worried about patrollers. <br/>
