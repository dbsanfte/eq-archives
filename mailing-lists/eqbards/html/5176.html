<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035165125">Wow, for a second there I thought I was at the message<br/>
board at The Vault.  Anyway, in comparison to UO, I<br/>
think everquest blows it away community wise, whereas<br/>
UO wins in character developement.  Of course, in UO<br/>
everyone was basically the same character, and if<br/>
melee classes think they&#39;re screwed here.......<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if there was a perfect server out there with<br/>
perfect players all a playing, the moment you log on<br/>
it&#39;s no longer perfect.  Just isn&#39;t the nature of our<br/>
world.  Yes there are problems, and yes camping and<br/>
leveling are boring as hell, but game design is not<br/>
going to change that.  Eventually the KeewL d00dz will<br/>
hit level 50 and go on to quake 3.  The herd will thin<br/>
out, and you&#39;ll be able to start a low level character<br/>
and roleplay him and quest him to your hearts content.<br/>
 EQ is not great in it&#39;s ability to spoon-feed you the<br/>
experiance, I think it&#39;s strength is it&#39;s ambiguity<br/>
(sp).  It&#39;s vauge enough that you and your friends can<br/>
write your own stories and impose them upon the world.<br/>
 I write stories for my guild based on the adventures<br/>
we&#39;ve had.  Granted I embellish a little to make it<br/>
more story and less game like, but the stories are<br/>
there for you to write.  It&#39;s all about what you bring<br/>
to the table.  And more important to make good friends<br/>
who like to roleplay than it is to get your polished<br/>
granite tommahawk.  Bottom line is, I&#39;ve never seen a<br/>
game people were willing to go through such great<br/>
lengths to both villanize and defend.  And if you were<br/>
truely apathetic, you wouldn&#39;t have posted the message<br/>
you did.  It shows you still care for the game, your<br/>
just frustrated, we all get that way.  Right now EQ is<br/>
the best thing out there aside pen and paper we just<br/>
have to hash it out and make it better ourselves. <br/>
Verant can&#39;t make people better players, they can&#39;t<br/>
make people less selfish, they can&#39;t give a 12 year<br/>
old a sudden realization of maturity.  Make the game<br/>
your own, travel with friends, and spend a lot of time<br/>
doing things with no tangable benifits.  It all washes<br/>
out in the end.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just me<br/>
