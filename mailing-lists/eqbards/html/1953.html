 </span></blockquote>17 is an awkward time.  You&#39;ve just gotten dual wield so<br/>
you&#39;ve ditched that shield thus lowering your AC and getting<br/>
beat up more.  Your dual wield skill probably stinks, so you<br/>
are not doing much more damage than if you were wielding just<br/>
one weapon.  Your new song probably isn&#39;t as effective as<br/>
elemental rhythms (I didn&#39;t compare the two until 19 and found<br/>
the two to be identical in magic resist and AC bonus then).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d agree with the others that most of the places you can hunt<br/>
are wide open places you can solo.  In addition to the<br/>
Karanas, the kodiaks and young kodiaks in West Commonlands<br/>
were pretty good fighting.  You can pounce on any wisps that<br/>
wander by to collect a fair amount of loot while you&#39;re doing<br/>
this too.  Just be careful of the hill giants and griffins,<br/>
and Kizdean Gix and the other dark elf (they have set routes<br/>
you can avoid once you learn them).  Unlike the Karanas, the<br/>
griffins are not normally aggressive unless they see you in<br/>
combat or you stand next to them too long (/con threatening).<br/>
Every once in a while there is a werewolf, which you should<br/>
probably run from; but if you don&#39;t mind kiting, you can try<br/>
to kill it because they carry some really good loot I hear<br/>
(skin sells for about 100pp).<br/>
<br/>
If you do decide to go to Unrest or Highpass or other &quot;tight&quot;<br/>
areas, make sure you have a good healer in the group. You will<br/>
be taking a lot of damage without a shield and with most<br/>
everything fixated on you.  But 17 was about the time I really<br/>
found lullaby to become very effective at controlling trains.  <br/>
My friends love me for that, and keep getting themselves<br/>
killed taking on more mobs than they can handle at once when<br/>
I&#39;m not there.  Try to get into banded ASAP if you haven&#39;t<br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>
And dare I mention it, Crushbone is pretty good in the L16-19<br/>
range.  It is usually total chaos in there, but you are high<br/>
enough that most of the trains that form there won&#39;t bother<br/>
you (some of the legionnaires will leave you alone).  And with<br/>
a good group you can take on the warlord, Lord Darish, and<br/>
Crush himself (all sometimes carry special items that can sell<br/>
for a lot of platinum).  The royal guard always carries at<br/>
least one bronze weapon too, which sells well (do NOT turn<br/>
your back on him, I&#39;ve been backstabbed for 82 (yes,<br/>
eighty-two) points).  The loot on the other orcs usually<br/>
stinks, but they come fast and furious and make up in quantity<br/>
what they lack in quality.  It&#39;s an outdoor zone so you can<br/>
kick in Accelerando and run if Dvinn sticks his head out (if<br/>
you think your group can handle him, give it a shot as he<br/>
carries that wonderful wonderful 6/23 dirk).<br/>
