 </span></blockquote>I like to call that &quot;weaving&quot; :) - The only trick I&#39;ve found is to have the<br/>
songs you weave in your hotkeys. I also have weapons slots and inventory<br/>
slots in another hotkey bank - which makes it easy to run from something<br/>
that is too tough but attacking AND do the switch to the drum for Selos.<br/>
That seems the fastest way to have less trouble weaving. However, as I&#39;m<br/>
only L11, quite the young bard myself, I don&#39;t have any other tricks except<br/>
to say that I notice that I stumble through it mostly when I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
too long and am getting sleepy :) I think, unless someone with more<br/>
experience says differently, it&#39;s all a matter of hotkeys and timing. Don&#39;t<br/>
know if this helped but I hope so.<br/>
