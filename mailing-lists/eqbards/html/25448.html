<b>Subject:</b> Drums of the Beast - walking? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-337814123">OK, I just tried out Selo&#39;s on the Drums of the Beast.  While weilding these <br/>
drums and playing either version of Selo&#39;s doesn&#39;t work.  Even walking <br/>
doesn&#39;t help.  You run standard run speed and walk standard walk speed, as <br/>
though you weren&#39;t playing Selo&#39;s at all.  In fact, weilding a sword and <br/>
singing Selo&#39;s gives you SOME improvement in speed, but as far as I can <br/>
tell, Drums of the Beast and Selo&#39;s are 100% incompatible.  I even made <br/>
mention of that fact in an email to the Developers Corner on the official EQ <br/>
message board earlier this week, but of course it could have been routed to <br/>
/dev/null for all the difference it made.  It hasn&#39;t even been posted, much <br/>
less responded to.  And it was quite a professional non-rant... hehe<br/>
<br/>
So I am led to one conclusion.  I read an email somewhere, I don&#39;t even <br/>
remember where, may even have been here, that the new high-level weapons, <br/>
armor, misc. drops lately have all been items that are really incredibly <br/>
good, except for one stat that ruins it.  So each item has a drawback that <br/>
makes you really have to think whether you will use it or not.  In effect, <br/>
allowing them to create lots of new items for us to drool over without <br/>
actually making them overpowering.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a bug with the runspeed <br/>
rolling over, but I&#39;m sure that Verant will consider the incompatability of <br/>
these drums and Selo&#39;s to be a &quot;feature&quot; as part of the &quot;Vision(tm)&quot;.  I&#39;m <br/>
sure it won&#39;t bother them one bit that this particular &quot;feature&quot; only <br/>
affects a handful of players and they&#39;ll save money by not having to fix, <br/>
err, &quot;enhance&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s my 2cp worth.  It would be nice if it worked, but it&#39;s such an <br/>
awesome drum otherwise, I&#39;m not really going to complain.<br/>
