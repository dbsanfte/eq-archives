<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bards and rubicite <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-49607378">The only reason I want rubicite is that I graduated from the University of<br/>
Alabama and the color of rubicite is our team color (crimson):-).  The<br/>
breastplate is the only piece I want.  Combined with steel for all the other<br/>
pieces, I think that would look pretty cool.  Call me vain but with a CHR of<br/>
115 it fits my character:-).  Based on the horror stories I&#39;ve read about<br/>
camping for rubicite, must admit I do not look forward to ever doing it.    <br/>

&gt; fact,<br/>
&gt; i cant stand cazic, so many jerks in that zone its sickening, the only<br/>
&gt; reason im looking for rubicite is for my rogue friend, which has a silvery<br/>
&gt; war axe to spare for rubi if i trade mine off, i also have Hatar&#39;s fine<br/>
&gt; silk<br/>
&gt; turbin which im trying to pawn off for some rubi for him, but no takers on<br/>
&gt; that either...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wondering where you heard this rumor from?  I read on EQVault that<br/>
&gt; rogues<br/>
&gt; &gt; and shamans were soon going to lose the ability to wear rubicite but saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; nothing about bards being included.  This may end up being a moot point<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Solusek bard quests give bard unique armor.  I think I would prefer<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing the quests, no matter how hard, versus camping for rubicite.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; And just because some of you actually read my messages, here is<br/>
&gt; today&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; secret: Get your rubicite armour while you still can.<br/>
