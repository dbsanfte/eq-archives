<div id="ygrps-yiv-599554201">from what I&#39;ve heard (not experienced yet) you probably won&#39;t even be <br/>
pulling, the wizards will with dd spells...<br/>
<br/>
you will be the mana provider and straggler chaser more than likely...<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s supposed to be just incredible XP for higher levels, have a cleric <br/>
friend who is doing it and getting enough to make it worthwhile for him at <br/>
52...<br/>

&gt;well i have been invited many times but never had the opportunity to join<br/>
&gt;one, though they say bards are needed. now i am not sure how aoe groups<br/>
&gt;exactly work and what a bards role in such a group is, so any advice is<br/>
&gt;welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i only know the bard should pull a lot of mobs, which get chainstunned by 2<br/>
&gt;chanters and then smoked by 3 AoE nukers. but do i sing anything else? any<br/>
&gt;special hint?<br/>

&gt;so long<br/>
