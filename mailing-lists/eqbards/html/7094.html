<div id="ygrps-yiv-621491824"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Also, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a <br/>
&gt; row in one of these unfortunate instances. If you respawn and <br/>
&gt; are immediately attacked by a guard at your bind point, you <br/>
&gt; need to use the /quit command. This immediately exits you <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about you, but I know for a fact that you appear<br/>
on the other side of a zone or respawn before you&#39;re actually<br/>
given control of your character again. I&#39;ve had many a times<br/>
where I was zoning and could hear myself being attacked but<br/>
was still waiting for my screen to show me what was going on<br/>
and allow me to fight back. With guards and any character of<br/>
low level, a couple hits and you&#39;re dead before you even get<br/>
to see what happened, or type anything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d still like to see how you expect to get past the Grobb<br/>
guards that sit outside the entrance in the first place. Let&#39;s<br/>
say you in fact are level 19 or higher and you have your invis<br/>
song. You get past the guards, get bound just inside the tunnel<br/>
and all is well. Now you&#39;re dead. You have no invis. You can&#39;t<br/>
go to the bank. Luckily no guards have been dragged to the zone<br/>
border. You have to figure out how to get past the <br/>
guards outside. How do you propose this is done?</div>
