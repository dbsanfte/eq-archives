 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve used the song a lot, saved a *lot* of money, and never seen any<br/>
adverse reaction.  The song actually casts an aura of enchantment on<br/>
yourself, attuned to a particular faction.  You choose a target to set that<br/>
faction, and there&#39;s a glow on them as the magic touches them, but they&#39;re<br/>
apparently not enchanted in any way and don&#39;t react negatively.<br/>

The higher the price the more you save, into the many platinum of savings.<br/>
It also helps to load up with as many charisma enhancing items as you can<br/>
scrounge.  I now have a silk evening shirt and a cats-eye amulet as my<br/>
shopping clothes and am watching out for appropriate earrings and other<br/>
items.  They all make a difference that&#39;s real easy to test.<br/>
