<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529094874">Heh, I went to go test these 2 after reading your post.  ER == Elemental<br/>
Rythmns?  Was thinking &quot;oh, good maybe I can melee and have huge MR now if<br/>
singing this is better than ER and drums...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But after I get Aura (its Aria is it not?) memmed I realize it&#39;s not MR buff<br/>
song but the target Cancel Magic debuff.  So, I decided to play with it a<br/>
bit anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
Like the other debuffs(cancel magic, pilliage enchantment), it agros the<br/>
target now.<br/>
<br/>
I attacked some greens in Lavastorm and it seemed to remove their damage<br/>
shields.  Should try it on some stronger mobs though.  Also, would be<br/>
interesting to try it on Dragoons.  I wonder how they get their insane MR -<br/>
do they all have runed bone forks?  Or do they have a spell buff on them?<br/>
Prolly just insanely high base stats.<br/>
