<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135680874">Ok I tested all our speedup songs. My results coincide with yours.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m rounding off my figures)<br/>
Normal 36 delay.<br/>
Warsong 29 delay. Warsong + BoC 20 delay. *boggle*<br/>
Anthem 33 delay. Anthem + BoC 20 delay. *double boggle*<br/>
VoC 30 delay. VoC + BoC 20 delay. *yet another boggle*<br/>
Berserker 30 delay. Berserker + BoC 20 delay. *and yes, boggle*<br/>
<br/>
Now I won&#39;t be able to get my hands on my FBSS anytime soon. If anyone<br/>
out there with one would care to do the same tests, that would be nice.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty certain the same results will show with any other haste item.<br/>
So its either some kind of bug, or simply how its designed.<br/>
However, if it were just limited to the BoC, that wouldn&#39;t mean a whole<br/>
lot anyways. There will never be level 10 bards with &#39;em to take full<br/>
advantage of it and sing Anthem with it, but oh well. Interesting none<br/>
the less.<br/>
<br/>
This brings up a gripe, we have a song for expansion that I believe was<br/>
posted as +45% attack speed with no stats. Thats utterly useless, much<br/>
like SLTW is if you already have a haste item. Perhaps we can get it<br/>
altered?<br/>
