<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951277372"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have to think that singing the Mana song in battle is not worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Here&#39;s the picture I faced last night.  Bat group, SolB, 1 tank,<br/>
  1 cleric, 1 enchanter, 1 wizard, 1 mage, and me.  Straight manasong<br/>
  with 0 twisting allowed for continuous pulling, twisting only slowed<br/>
  things down.  So to say something isn&#39;t worth it depends all on the<br/>
  situation.  Plus, if they ask you to play straight manasong and you<br/>
  refuse, the waiting list you were on for 1 or 2 hours to get in that<br/>
  group will return.  Cause people who want pure manasong will disband<br/>
  you if you try to convince them of any other song methods.  I&#39;ve <br/>
  tried to be the informative little bard, and show them how well I<br/>
  can twist, but casters don&#39;t care to hear it, and I&#39;ve sat on the<br/>
  bench a few times gaining no exp for being so noble.  The waiting<br/>
  list for the king room in SolB last night had 15 people on it...<br/>
  By the time you finally get in there, you would do anything for<br/>
  the exp =)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I have to pick one song to sing, it&#39;s probably Lullaby (which <br/>
&gt; impressed the heck out of a bunch of level 42-50s in Lower Guk the other <br/>
&gt; night - I was level 34 at the time).  I sing the Mana Song when we&#39;re <br/>
&gt; done.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You are asking for trouble if you keep this song playing, trust me.<br/>
  You do not want nor need the extra attention.  I&#39;m not certain how<br/>
  effective you are in Lguk with Lullaby anyway, I got a stream of<br/>
  steady resists using it up and around the lord room, dead side.<br/>
  And I was level 40 at the time.  When the pull gets really ugly,<br/>
  and it&#39;s full of things that can kill you in a heartbeat, I&#39;d<br/>
  rather let the tank eat the dmg, and let the cleric have to worry<br/>
  about healing one person, than two.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not being hypothetical about all this, I was there last night,<br/>
  and there for the last 2 months playing around with different <br/>
  things.  What you play depends on your group, and just saying f&#39;<br/>
  them I&#39;ll do whatever I think is best (allbeit you may be right)<br/>
  gets you the cold iron toe boot.  My advice to people with charm<br/>
  and lullaby mem&#39;d who find it still useful... get the most out <br/>
  of it now, you&#39;ll rarely use them later on in your career.<br/>
<br/>
  The enchanter will speed up your tanks, and AE stun/mez the<br/>
  enemies better than you ever could.  Just give him/her the <br/>
  mana.<br/>
<br/>
  This group btw, killed 5 sonic bats, 1 guano harvester, and <br/>
  2 lava beetles simultaneously.  No twisting.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
