<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; West Karana - go for the y-kodis and full kodis - need a <br/>
&gt; helper or 2 and<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll do good.  Also if the Dervs are spawning nicely - you and some<br/>
&gt; friends can keep them at bay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; East Karana - there is a terrible snake problem near the N Ro <br/>
&gt; tunnel.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; your duty to do something about it!  Wear some stuff that is <br/>
&gt; anti-poison!<br/>
&gt; Keep Purifying Rythmns playing.  Asp&#39;s are nasty beasties!  By 14, you<br/>
&gt; should be able to solo them - having a friend with cure <br/>
&gt; poison really helps.<br/>
&gt; Also you can hope for the occasional air-elemental and wisp to go by.<br/>
