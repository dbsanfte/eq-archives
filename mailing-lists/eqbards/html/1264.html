You can pick up, hopefully, some Runed Totem Staffs and some Snakeskin armor, as well as other loot there.  The RTS&#39; I&#39;ve seen sold for 25 - 30 pp and the snakeskin gloves and facemasks are hot commodity items at 5pp each.  <br/>

I&#39;m at 15, my gf is a 15 mage, and we&#39;d usually try to pick up 1 other player level 14 - 16 to join us near Rexx&#39;s room.  It&#39;s a maze in there so try to find someone who knows the area.  : )  Fight Commanders, Nobles, and the Named NPC Shaman for the loot I mentioned.<br/>

    I&#39;m a lvl 15 bard and i&#39;m looking for a great place to make a lot of cash, plus get some exp.  Do any of you higher lvl bards know of a good place.  I need the cash to start upgrading my armor and to buy a combined long sword.  I appreciate any reply...<br/>
