<div id="ygrps-yiv-677908166"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What are the general directions to get to Kelethin?<br/>
&gt; I know the boat to Butcherblock part but from there on I am lost.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get off the boat, run off the end of the pier and onto the path.<br/>
Follow the path, past the Dwarven City of Kaladim, and a number<br/>
of guard outposts. One outpost will coincide with you hitting<br/>
a &quot;T&quot; in the path, where you can go left or right. Go Left.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, the path will end; continue forward for a short<br/>
bit and you should be in the zone transfer from Butcherblock<br/>
to Greater Feydark.<br/>
<br/>
Pick up the path again. Ignore the path to the left, which<br/>
is a dead end. Later, ignore the path to the right, which heads<br/>
into the Lesser Feydark.<br/>
<br/>
Still later, a path splits to the left, where going ahead<br/>
leads you quickly to the gates of Felwithe, the city of<br/>
the High Elves. You might want to stop in Felwithe for<br/>
provisions and (maybe) a free bind if one is handy ;) but<br/>
you want to take the other fork -- left when coming from<br/>
Butcherblock, or to the right after leaving Felwithe.<br/>
<br/>
After a turn to the left, ignore the path that splits off<br/>
to the right, it dead-ends.<br/>
<br/>
The path peters out at a lift that takes you into Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
Switch from RUN to WALK before getting on the lift, and switch<br/>
to an external camera viewing from above (and behind) you, to<br/>
see ramps from one area to another properly. Walking off the edge<br/>
is good for &gt;100 damage.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Also as a lvl 8 bard, what should I hunt to get the most loot? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I&#39;ve got my Bard to L7, and never been higher.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) How dangerous is the passage to Kelethin?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to not die on another continent if at all possible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did it at level 3. Later, twisting Accelerando, I felt comfortable<br/>
not dodging around blue, white(black) and yellow things. Have been<br/>
hit en passant by various mobs, that I now give a few more feet of<br/>
distance when doing the transcontinental shuffle, but never bad enough<br/>
to be more than a &quot;minor excitement&quot; in the trip. But I always wield<br/>
my Drum on the long trips ...<br/>
