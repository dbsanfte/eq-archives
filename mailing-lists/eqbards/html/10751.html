<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844160674">*sigh* NO. Don&#39;t make everyone bind in cities. Allow everyone to be bound<br/>
anywhere.<br/>
I tell you, as a caster in most of my active characters (druid, enchanter,<br/>
wizard, bard)<br/>
I would be HAPPY to bind someone outside of the cities if the game would<br/>
allow<br/>
me. I have no beef with tanks binding outside of cities. It would mean<br/>
we could get back to our playing all that much faster. I&#39;ve even run out to<br/>
zone line<br/>
in various city zones to bind people so they can be that much closer to<br/>
where they are going<br/>
(or because they are evil and can&#39;t go in further)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t handicap everyone in some move of spite. Try to get stuff added to<br/>
everyone.<br/>
IMHO, it is ridiculous not to allow it. Perhaps make it a Yes-no thing like<br/>
the<br/>
revive. *shrug* :) So someone can&#39;t get bound somewhere they don&#39;t want to<br/>
be<br/>
bound.<br/>

&gt;That would definitely help, but just make everyone bind in cities only.<br/>
&gt;That would eliminate the huge discrepancy between casters and non-casters<br/>
&gt;that now exists until level 29.  Currently if I and my caster friend both<br/>
&gt;die, he has regained his lost experience by the time I get back to the<br/>
&gt;dungeon to regain my corpse.<br/>

&gt;&gt; This would be true if they gated out of the zone, but noooooo, these<br/>
&gt;beight<br/>
&gt;&gt; ones gated to the zone entry.  Naturally the gobs all headed that way<br/>
&gt;&gt; immediately.  Also since SoW can last for 25+ minutes its pretty easy for<br/>
&gt;&gt; SoW casters to still have speed underground and cause huge trains so that<br/>
&gt;&gt; only the bards get their speed taken away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I can forsee in the future, no more binding inside dungeons.<br/>
&gt;  There is no real need for it.  And it&#39;s only used to exploit<br/>
&gt;  the game:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  1) Find the mob you want, tag it, gate to zoneline, and fight<br/>
&gt;     it there in a safer environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  2) Raid of Vox/Nagafen.  Need I say more?  hehehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  3) Shortcuts back into deep dungeon areas to kill X mob<br/>
&gt;     instead of running through a fully spawned dungeon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Those are the things I&#39;ve seen, I bet there are 3 more<br/>
&gt;  uses for the binding in dungeons which exploit one thing<br/>
&gt;  or another.  There is really no good reason to bind in<br/>
&gt;  a dungeon to defend doing it.  I mean they can bind right<br/>
&gt;  outside the entrance, which is something non-casters wont<br/>
&gt;  be able to do anyway.  No binding in dungeons would elimate<br/>
&gt;  the ability for casters to psuedo-train in the same fashion<br/>
&gt;  as Verant has deemed SoW/Selos users.<br/>
