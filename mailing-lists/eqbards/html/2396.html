<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129065748">I would like to take a moment to address that issue.  The message boards on EQ<br/>
Vault for some reason have flamed FoH every step of the way.  They call them<br/>
cheaters, exploiters, and worse.  I have found this to not be the case.  I have<br/>
come into contact with several FoH and, although they may be short tempered and<br/>
rude sometimes, this in no way precludes cheating, exploiting, or worse.  They<br/>
are the highest level guild in the game because they are willing to give up<br/>
their external lives, if ones existed, and play EQ 18 hours a day.  I am not<br/>
willing to make that sacrifice, are any of you?  They earned their positions and<br/>
all the benefits that come from it, so it is unfair to flame them in fits of<br/>
jealousy, which is what those on EQVaults message boards do.<br/>

&gt; Perhaps the people on the other list wouldn&#39;t fill that way if they had been<br/>
&gt; reading some of the posts on this list by JM and the other high level<br/>
&gt; contributors:-).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I did notice one of the posts was from a member of the Fires of Heaven guild<br/>
&gt; (the guild who recently kiiled Lady Vox with/without the help of Aradune).<br/>
&gt; I play on E&#39;ci so have no idea how this guild operates and really don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care.  However, if you believe some of the recent posts on EQVault, the<br/>
&gt; Fires of Heaven guild consists primarily of powergamers.  From all the great<br/>
&gt; posts I have read on this list, the general consensus among us seems to<br/>
&gt; indicate that playing a bard is not very suitable to the type of person who<br/>
&gt; powergames.  Perhaps that is why the poster felt that bards were useless.<br/>
&gt; Pure speculation on my part.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Crip Fireblade from FoH here...<br/>
&gt; &gt; lvl 49 bard on Veeshan<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     My question or statement is really bards are totally screwed over at<br/>
&gt; &gt; high levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not only do they have no chance of meleeing even a tenth as well as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior, but there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are NO high level songs that are worthwhile.<br/>
