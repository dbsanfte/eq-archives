<div id="ygrps-yiv-938525141">I, too, found it to be about 2 levels to max out my blunt and piercing<br/>
skills. I am currently level 26, and I first started blunt when I got a<br/>
Screaming Mace back around 21st level. I maxed Blunt out real fast by<br/>
dumping about 10 training points into it, then equipping the Screamer and a<br/>
FS Mace/Morning Star. After maxing Blunt out, I then started around 23r<br/>
level to max out my Piercing by equipping a Dragoon Dirk and Bone Fork.<br/>
Maxed it out right after hitting 25th level. Now I am playing around with<br/>
different combos, but that Dirk, I hate to say, is just too nasty. Better<br/>
than a Combine Long Sword by far, and at half the price (bought mine for<br/>
25pp, and see them going for 20-30 plat quite often), or, if you are in your<br/>
20s, you can get it for free by grouping and killing Dvinn yourself. To me,<br/>
the Dirk makes most Combine weapons and below OBSOLETE. Thank Erolisi Marr<br/>
that the dirk is a Lore item.<br/>
<br/>
Why did I suddenly become concerned with maxing out my piercing and blunt<br/>
weapons stats? Mainly for two reasons.<br/>
1) I was worried that later down the road I&#39;d find some kick-butt Blunt or<br/>
Piercing Weapon, and would be sitting with a Blunt or Piercing Skill of like<br/>
4. To me, it provides more options in weaponry, regardless of your level.<br/>
<br/>
2) A theory a friend and I came up with: some weapon types do more damage<br/>
against certain foes. Yeah, there may be absolutely no factual basis for<br/>
this, except that it seems like my Druid friend hurt skellies a lot more<br/>
with his blunt than my slashing, yet against other types of critters, I<br/>
consistantly outdamaged him. Perhaps it was a program fluke, perhaps it was<br/>
just my friend and I drinking too much Jum Jum, I am not sure (smile).<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, there&#39;s my 2 copper&#39;s worth...<br/>
