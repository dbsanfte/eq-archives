&gt; I have heard that you can do this. FYI - rumor and hearsay - not actually<br/>

&gt; p.s. 550 gold coins? Bah - take this plat and like it!<br/>
<br/>
heh, you didn&#39;t have to give her the 550 gold coins?  I had no idea at the<br/>
time, so I had to leave some of my armor at home so I wasn&#39;t too encumbered.<br/>
:)  For my 2nd bracer, though, I didn&#39;t need to buy the fire opals, as<br/>
someone had sold a lambent fire opal to a merchant near the bank in<br/>
Freeport, which I was able to purchase for 105pp.  Saved myself 5pp and a<br/>
lambent stone. :)  I still have no idea why they sold it to the merchant,<br/>
though I&#39;m glad they did. :)<br/>
