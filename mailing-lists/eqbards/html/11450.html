<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034537124">Hmm... I thought the Catliff was indifferent to everyone.  Due to the quest he gives.  I&#39;ve camped in the<br/>
secret room a fair amount and have never seen him unfortunately.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; the Crested Helm,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Very rare drop, you&#39;ll probably see 10 spaulders before the helm.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   This is a most sought after item, even by higher level people.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   The Caitliff in MM drops this, but he is an uncommon spawn, with<br/>
&gt; &gt;   a rare helm drop which equals hours and hours or camping unless<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you get lucky on the first few shots.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; Wow!  I guess I didn&#39;t know how lucky I was when I got mine then!  I was<br/>
&gt; camping the secret room off of the Mistmoore Graveyard for my Black Silk<br/>
&gt; Gloves and experience when the Caitliff just sauntered in and we killed him.<br/>
&gt; He had the helm and I won the roll and have been wearing it ever since: AC<br/>
&gt; 10, STR 6, CHA 3, Weight 5.0.  Good bardic stuff.<br/>
