<div id="ygrps-yiv-433277731">don&#39;t worry Martyn, that is one of the most outrageously prices asked i have<br/>
seen.  MAYBE the breastplate could be sold for that, and that is considering<br/>
crafted bp&#39;s go for around 1k.  though i have yet to see any actual prices<br/>
for lambent armor as of yet, your offer was much more in line.<br/>

&gt; Some brain dead Bard twink on the Mithaniel Marr server Was <br/>
&gt; selling Lambent<br/>
&gt; gauntlets today. was taking offers. I offered her 250 for <br/>
&gt; them. she said she<br/>
&gt; was only taking serious offers over 2k.<br/>
&gt; Please please please.. no one, no matter how much money you <br/>
&gt; have to burn,<br/>
&gt; buy ANY lambent for that price. they are not THAT hard to get.<br/>
